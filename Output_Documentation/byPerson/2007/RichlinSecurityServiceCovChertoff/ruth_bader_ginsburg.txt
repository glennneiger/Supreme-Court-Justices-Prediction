mr.
wolfman,
what
about
the
cap
that's
not
present
in
1988
and
is
present
in
eaja?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfman,
if
there's
any
discretion
in
the
district
judge
in
setting
the
amount
of
the
fee,
then
why
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
to
say,
now
there's
a
cap
for
the
lawyer
is
$125
an
hour,
but
we
know
the
true
market
rate
for
that
lawyer
is
$200?
does
it
do
the
same
thing
with
the
paralegal?
the
true
market
rate
is
x,
and
we're
going
to
knock
it
down
so
that
it
will
match
the
knock-down
for
the
lawyer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
likely
that
when
congress
said
that,
it
was
not
thinking
of
paralegals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
cost?
could
you...
one
could
say
i'm
going
to
look
at
the
internet
and
come
up
with
$35
dollars
an
hour,
or
you
could
say
in
the
case
of
a
paralegal
there
is
a
part
of
the
overhead,
there
is
the
fringe
benefits...
so
just
giving
the
hourly
rate
is
deceptive
of
what
the
actual
cost
is
to
the
law
firm,
because
the
law
firm
has
to
add
on
to
determine
what
in
fact
it's
paying
for
the
paralegal,
the
fringe
benefits
and
part
of
the
overhead.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know
you
said
that
a
few
times
and
you
have
authority
for
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
odd
if
you
look
at
1988
and
if
the
attorney's
fees
and
costs...
and
costs
is
very
limited
in
the
statute
in
1920...
and
if
you
have
attorney's
fees
and
other
expenses,
other
expenses
is
a
much
larger
category
than
costs
within
1988.
so
i...
i
would
think
that,
well,
eaja
is
the
more
compensatory
because
it
allows
for
more
items.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
that
when
this
language
first
came
in...
this
is
in
relation
to
justice
breyer's
question...
there
was
no
cap?
when
did
the...
when
was
the
cap
put
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
a
lot
of
weight
to
be
put
on
three
little
words:
"billed
at
cost".
if
you
just
read
those
words,
you
could
be
the
costs
to
the
client,
the
cost
to
the
law
firm
and
then
you'd
have
to
go
to
this
further
document,
the
administrative
conference
document,
it's
rather
thin
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked
of
mr.
wolfman.
isn't
there...
doesn't
it
make
sense
to
take
a
word
like
"attorney's
fees"
and
like
the
word
"discrimination",
we
have
many
different
anti-discrimination
statutes,
but
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
give
that
word
"discrimination"
the
same
meaning
in
all
those
statutes.
and
here
the
term
attorney's
fees,
if
it
means
that
includes
all
of
them,
in
terms
of
1988,
why
not
say
every
time
attorney's
fees
comes
up,
that's
what
it's
going
to
mean?
