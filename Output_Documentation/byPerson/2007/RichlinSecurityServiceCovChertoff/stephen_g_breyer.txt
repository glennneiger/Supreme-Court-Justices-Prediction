justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
not
say
no
one
else,
but
not
everyone
else
places
the
importance
on
legislative
history
that
i
do,
but
i
do.
and
i
saw
here
that
the
senate
judiciary
committee
considered
all
these
arguments,
they
wrote
a
report;
and
they
sided
with
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
know
it
was
there,
but
it
doesn't
matter
to
me
it
was
on
a
bill
that
was
later
not
passed,
and
then
unless
there
is
something
different--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
that
reason,
because
in
my
own
mind
i'm
thinking
there
were
a
group
of
people
on
the
committee,
they
went
through
the
issue,
they
reflected
views
of
their
principles,
they
work
it
out,
and
unless
something
changed
that
makes
me
think
that
isn't
the
working
out
of
it,
i
would
put
a
lot
of
weight
on
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
you're
going
to
tell
me
what
there
is,
i
hope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
it
is
a
problem
with
legislative
history.
[laughter]
i
think
that
the
people
in
congress
who
hired
their
staffs
pay
attention
to
what
the
staffs
say
in
precisely
the
same
way
that
any
other
executive--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean
that
wouldn't
be
surprising
would
it,
that
wouldn't
be
surprising
because
you
have,
in
fact,
very
complex
bills
that
have
14
sections
and
section
of
the
b
bill
could
have
been
vetoed...
been
vetoed
because
of
problem
with
section
14
and
repassed
without
section
14,
in
which
case
the
legislative
history
for
the
other
13
sections
would
be
highly
illuminating
as
to
what
they
mean.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
question
that
i
had
in
respect
to
this
statute
is...
is
that
my
impression
and
here...
i'd
like
to
know
how
they
bill
secretary's
times.
i'd
like
to
know
how
they
bill
rent.
and
my
thought
is...
and
i
want
to
be
either
verified
or
told
i'm
wrong
and
explain
it,
that
when
you
have
no
cap,
the
lawyer
and
the
client
want
to
shove
everything
possible
into
the
rubric
attorney's
fees,
including
the
kitchen
sink,
if
the
plumber
is
there
in
the
kitchen
of
the
law
firm.
[laughter]
that's
fine.
no
problem.
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
paid
for
them.
but
where
you
have
a
cap,
you
should
shove
everything
the
other
side,
if
expenses
are
going
to
be
paid
for
it,
because
that
cap
means
that
the
lawyer
will
not
get
his
full
pay
back
and
therefore,
the
lower
the
cap,
the
more
you
want
to
be
sure
it's
covering
only
that
lawyer's
time.
and
everything
else
goes
into
expense
so
that
you
can
pay
the
lawyer
adequately
and
he
will
recover
his
expenses
elsewhere.
was
that
the
theory
of
this
bill?
is
there
any
evidence
that
that
was
the
theory?
if
you
did
it
that
way,
would
anything
get
mixed
up?
