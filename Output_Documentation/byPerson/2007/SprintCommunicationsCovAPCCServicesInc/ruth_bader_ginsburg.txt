but
it
would
be
just
the
same,
mr.
phillips,
would
it
not,
if
the
arrangement
was
that
the
aggregator
gets
a
piece
of
the
action?
let's
take
out
the
de
minimis
one
cent.
a
significant
stake,
like
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
has.
so
you
would
have
the
same
problems
that
you're
complaining
about
with
regard
to
discovery
from
the
individual
psps,
the
same
problem
with
respect
to
counterclaim.
that's...
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
this
isn't
about
a
whole
lot
if
just
by
the
device
of
giving
the
aggregator
part
of
the,
a
piece
of
the
action,
this
suit
would
be
okay
because
the
prudential
objections
that
you
are
making
here
would
apply
just
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
there
be
review?
the
fcc,
you
pointed
out,
doesn't
have
article
iii
barriers.
so
the
fcc
decides
one
way
or
another.
one
party
ends
up
losing.
is
there
review
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
advantage?
you
have
proposed
the
fcc
route.
that
obviously
wasn't
taken
here.
what
is
the
advantage
of
going
to
federal
court
on
claims
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
the
plaintiff
make
such
a
choice
if
the
agency--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
the
aggregator
had...
that
the
aggregator
could
sue
on
behalf
of
these
1400
plaintiffs
naming
every
one
of
them
as
a
named
plaintiff
in
this
complaint
and
still
the
aggregator
would
run
the
show
because
they
each
authorized
the
aggregator
to
conduct
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
very
prudential
to
require
that
there
be
1400
named
plaintiffs
instead
of
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
your
position
was
they
could
all
join
in
one
complaint
just
as
long
as
they're
all
named
separately.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
significance
to
this
being
the...
this
assignment
transfers
legal
title.
true,
there's
an
obligation
to
pay,
to
pay
the
separate
psps.
but
does
anything
turn
on
legal
title?
for
example,
suppose
the...
i
gather
the
check
would
be
payable
to
the
aggregator
if
the
aggregator
prevails.
could
a
creditor
of
the
aggregator
come
in
and
say,
stop,
you
owe
me
lots
of
money
and
i
want
to
reach
those
proceeds?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
are
just
the
creditors.
or
the
aggregator
goes
bankrupt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
said...
i
thought
it
said,
mr.
englert,
that,
that
the
united
states
has...
is
treated
as
having
assigned
part
of
its
claim
for
damages
to
the
qui
tam
relator,
and
that
gave
the
qui
tam
plaintiff
a
stake
in
the
action,
a
stake
in
the
proceeds.
i
thought
that
vermont
agency...
and
justice
scalia
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
was
envisioning
the
kind
of
assignment
that
judge
sentelle
was
talking
about
when
he
said
there
are
assignments
and
then
there
are
assignments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
did
they
do?
i
mean,
you
mention
necessary
parties
but
these
other...
on
your
own
theory
the
psps
are
not
necessary
parties,
and
this...
this
is
a
defendant
seeking
to
join
additional
plaintiffs,
and
that's
rather
odd.
and
you
also
talk
about
interpleader.
i
don't
know
who
is
the
stakeholder
in
this
picture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
significance--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
the
legal
title,
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
assignee
did
not
have
legal
title,
was
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so...
but
is
that
just
a
formality?
for
example,
the
question
i
asked
mr.
phillips.
could
a
creditor
of
the
aggregator
get
at
this
money
when
the
check
is
paid
by
at&t
and
sprint
and
therefore
reduce
the
amount
available
to
distribute
to
the
psps?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
for
tax
purposes?
must
the
aggregator
report
the
proceeds
as
income?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--suppose
this
had
been
mounted
as
a
class
action.
i
take
it
you
would
oppose
certification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
one
of
the
reasons
would
be
that
these
are
all
different
situations,
different
amounts
involved
in
each
case?
some...
you
would
have
a
counterclaim,
not
others.
i
assume
you
would
say
they're
not
a
lot
alike.
