mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
last
things
mr.
phillips
said
was
there's
no
need
to
change
the
law
in
this
case
and
i
strongly
agree
with
that.
assignees
for
collection
have
been
litigating
in
federal
courts
since
at
least
the
19th
century
and
there
is
not
one
decision
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
in
which
an
assignee's
lawsuit
was
dismissed
solely
because
of
what
the
assignee
intended
to
do
with
the
proceeds.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
scalia,
a
single
decision,
a
small
body
of
decisions
that
don't
address
the
issue
of
standing,
can
be
looked
at
in
that
way.
but
a
unanimous
body
of
case
law,
two
decisions
from
this
court,
arguably
a
third
decision
from
this
court,
many
decisions
from
lower
courts--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but
there
is
an
enormous
body
in
the
lower
courts
under
rule
17.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
justice
souter,
the
cases
don't
always
discuss
the
way
in
which
the
assignment
arose.
but
typically,
in
those
cases
they
simply
say,
there
are
these
two
promises,
and
they
say
the
fact
that
there
is
a
second
promise
makes
no
difference.
that's
my
position.
the
fact
that
there's
a
second
promise,
whether
in
the
same
document
or
in
a
different
document,
makes
no
difference.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
earliest
case--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
earliest
case
that
gives
judgment
is
spiller
in
1920.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
assignee
standing,
not
assignee
for
collection
standing
but
assignee
standing,
is
referred
to
in
blackstone's
commentaries
contemporaneously
with
the
constitution.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
this
wrinkle
of
arguing--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--but
the
wrinkle
of
arguing
that
that
makes
a
difference
as
far
as
i
know
first
arose
in
the
19th
century.
and
every
single
case
and
every
single
federal
court
that
has
considered
the
question
under
any
body
of
law
has
rejected
the
argument.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
late
18th...
late
19th
century.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
as
you
know,
i
argue
that
the
vermont
agency
case
strongly
supports
us.
but
if
you
want
a
case
specifically
about
assigning
collection,
then
the
latest
case
i
have
is
titus
in
1939.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
absolutely
not,
justice
alito.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
for
the
exact
reason
mr.
phillips
gave
you.
the
asarco
case
and
coleman
v.
miller,
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion,
and
a
number
of
other
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
party
who
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
or
of
any
other
federal
court
must
satisfy
article
iii.
so
when
spiller,
the
secretary
of
the
cattleman's
association,
went
to
the
federal
district
court
seeking
enforcement
of
the
reparations
award
he
had
gotten
before
the
icc,
he
had
to
satisfy
article
iii.
when
titus
came
to
this
court
arguing
that
the
lower
courts
had
not
properly
given
full
faith
and
credit,
he
had
to
satisfy
article
iii.
each
of
those
parties
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
was
someone
who
had
to
turn
over
100
percent
of
the
proceeds
to
the
assignors.
and
in
each
case
this
court
rejected
the
argument
that
he
was
not
a
proper
plaintiff.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
my
client--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
that's...
that's
false
in
every
possible
respect,
your
honor.
he
does
keep...
get
to
keep
some
of
the
money.
now,
we
haven't
proved
that
in
the
lower
court.
it's
an
allegation
at
this
point,
but
it
happens
to
be
true.
but
aside
from
that--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--on
the
assumption,
but
not
the
fact.
second,
my
client's
whole
reason
for
existence
is
to
collect
payphone
compensation.
this
is
what
my
client
does
day
in
and
day
out.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
what's
enough
to
support
article
iii
standing
is
the
interest
of
the
assignors,
as
the
court
held
in
vermont
agency.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the
assignee--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
assignee
is
bringing
the
lawsuit
for
the
most
pragmatic
of
all
possible
reasons.
mr.
phillips
wanted
to
talk
a
lot
about
discovery,
and
justice
kennedy
and
i
believe
justice
souter
asked
why
is
this
lawsuit
in
federal
court
instead
of
before
the
fcc.
there
are
good
answers
to
those
questions.
the
discovery
in
federal
court,
the
discovery
available
in
federal
court,
is
more
appropriate
to...
is
more
necessary
in
a
large
case,
a
$200
million
case
like
this
one,
than
in
a
relatively
small
case--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
did.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the...
the
assignee's
injury--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--it
is,
as
this
court
said
in
vermont
agency,
the
assignor's
injury
and
it
is
redressed
by--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--here
that's
not
the
case,
but
the
reasoning
of
vermont
agency
specifically
rejected
the
proposition
that
the
bounty
was
helpful
to
the
assignee's
standing.
and
there
is
not
a
word
in
vermont
agency
that
says
when
you
combine
the
bounty
with
the
assignor's
interest
that's
enough.
it
just
says
the
assignor's
interest
is
enough,
full
stop,
because
of
the
ancient
doctrine.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
the...
the
assignment
in
this
case
conveys
all
right,
title
and
interest.
it
conveys
it
for
purposes
of
collection
to
be
sure,
but
it
conveys
all
right,
title
and
interest.
now,
the
proposition
that
the
"for
purposes
of
collection"
purpose
of
an
assignment
negates
the
ability
of
the
plaintiffs
to
sue
is
one
that
has
been
litigated
many
times
in
federal
courts,
and
that
argument
has
been
rejected
in
every
case
in
which
it's
come
up
until
now,
including
two
from
this
court.
so
between
the
fact
that
the
reasoning
of
vermont
agency,
whatever
the
facts
were,
relied
on
the
interest
of
the
assignor,
relied
on
the
ancient
doctrine
that
the
assignee
for
article
iii
purposes
stands
in
the
assignor's
shoes,
and
the
fact
that
this
argument
has
been
rejected
in
every
case
in
which
it's
come
up,
i
think
the
case
for
article
iii
standing
is
quite
strong
here.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
justice
scalia--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--there
is
tremendous
concrete
adverseness
in
this
case.
and
both
parties
have
a
great
stake
in
winning
and
losing.
the...
the
aggregator
doesn't
get
to
keep
the
money,
although
actually
it
does,
but
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
assumption,
subject
to
remand
that
it
doesn't
get
to
keep
the
money.
but
it
exists
for
the
purpose
of
bringing...
of
obtaining
redress
from
carriers
obtaining
payphone
compensation
from
carriers,
usually
outside
the
litigation
process.
but
this
is...
but
this
is
what
my
client
does...
what
my
clients
do.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
my
client
is
not
in
the
business
of
suing
on
the
behalf
of
payphone
operators.
my
client
is
in
the
business
of
collecting,
usually
outside
the
litigation
process.
this
is
merely
an
extension
of
the
day-to-day
operation.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
one.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sure.
and
let
me
give
you
one--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
they
are
all
assigned
to
one
entity
that
brings
the
cause
of
action
just
as
a
trustee
brings
causes
of
action--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the
point
at
which
they
are
all
assigned
to
one
entity
that
then
brings
the
cause
of
action,
and
importantly,
has
authority
to
settle
the
cause
of
action
without
any
further
permission
from
the
clients.
the...
a
very,
very
important
protection
here
for
mr.
phillips--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--every
rule
23
class
action,
every
associational
standing
case,
every
trustee
action.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
every
associational
standing
case,
every
action
brought
by
a
trustee.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
but
that's
not
uncommon,
your
honor.
justice
souter's
opinion
for
the
court
in
united
food
and
commercial
workers
v.
brown
reported
a
seventh
circuit
case
that
said
representative
damages
litigation
is
common
from
class
actions
under
rule
23
to
suits
by
trustees
representing
hundreds
of
creditors
in
bankruptcy,
to
parent
patriae
actions
by
state
governments
to
litigation
by
and
against
executors
at
decedent's
estates.
this
is
something
that
happens
every
day
in
federal
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
actually
not
entirely
liquidated
amounts.
there
are
ongoing
disputes
about
ongoing
payphone
compensation.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
even
if
that
weren't
true.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no.
but,
justice
kennedy,
consider
the
typical
rule
23
damages
action,
which
is
about
amounts
due
in
the
ordinary
case.
you
have
one
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
the
class
instead
of
many
causes
of
action
on
behalf
of
many
people.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
we
have
something
much
better
here.
what
we
have
here,
justice
kennedy,
is
assignments
of
the
cause
of
actions
by
every
plaintiff
to
my
clients
completely--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--actually
there
is.
rule
17
was
put
in
the
rules.
and
if
you
read
the
works
of
judge
charles
clark,
you
will
see
that
rule
17
was
put
in
the
rules
to
authorize
just
this
kind
of
action
to
be
brought
in
the
name
of
assignees,
including
asignees
for
collection.
and
one
year
after
he
joined
the
federal--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--you're
not
missing
something,
justice
stevens.
that's
what
this
case
is
about,
is
computer
records,
massive
computer
records
in
possession
of
the
carriers
and
some
tools
the
aggregators
have
to
analyze
computer
records.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
he
says
he
has
some
counterclaims,
but
in
nine
years
of
litigation
his
clients
have
never
used
rule
19;
they
have
never
used
rule
22;
they
have
never
made
any
effort...
he
says
we
have
asserted
they
have
to
go
out
and
bring
1,400
separate
lawsuits.
what
we
said
on
page
10
of
our
brief
was
they
have
never
tried
in
nine
years
of
of
litigation
to
use--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
my
point
is
that
there
are
many
procedural
devices
available
to
deal
with
many
situations
like
this,
rule
19
and
rule
22
and
separate
lawsuits.
if
there
were
serious
counterclaims
in
this
case,
first
of
all
as
a
factual
matter,
at&t
and
sprint
would
know
it
from
their
own
records
and
second,
they
would
have
done
something
in
nine
years
to
try
to
bring
a
claim
against
psp,
and
they
have
done
nothing
in
nine
years.
so
this
is
a
very,
very
odd
case
in
which
to
be
worrying
about
whether
they
have
lost
some
counterclaim
rights
because
the
psps...
lost
some
counterclaim
rights
because
the
psps
aren't
individual
parties.
it's
also
a
very
odd
case
in
which
to
be
worrying
about
discovery
rights
because
the
psps
aren't
individual
parties
because
that
issue
was
resolved
in
their
favor
in
2002
by
the
special
master's
discovery
order
saying,
just
as
justice
stevens
postulated,
the
aggregator
to
go
out
and
get
the
information
from
the
psps.
now
they
complained
that
some
of
the
psps,
some
of
these
mom
and
pop
operations,
said
we
don't
have
any
information.
that's
because
for
the
most
part
the
psp
don't
have
any
information.
the
information
resides
with
the
carriers
and
with
the
aggregators.
so
as
a
purely
practical,
pragmatic
matter
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
to
be
worrying
that
some
discovery
rights
have
been
lost;
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
to
be
worrying
in
which
some
counterclaim
rights
have
been
lost;
this
is
not
the
case
in
which
to
be
worrying
that
my
clients
aren't
bound.
every
single...
i'm
sorry,
that
the
psps
aren't
bound,
the
assignors
aren't
bound,
because
every
single
one
of
them
has
signed
an
agreement,
or
two
agreements,
really,
saying
they
will
be
bound.
what
this
comes
down
to
is
a
series
of
abstractions
put
up
against
the
tradition
of
allowing
lawsuits
by
assignee
for
collection.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
they
do.
there
is
no--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
several
points
if
i
may.
47
u.s.c.
in
section
276
says
that
payphone
service
providers
are
to
be
compensated
for
each
and
every
payphone
call.
so
it
was
congress's
purpose
to
make
any
24
cent
call
compensable,
and
the
fcc
set
up
a
very
elaborate
system
to
make
them
keep
records.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
as...
and
there
is
about
$200
million
at
stake
in
this
case
so
this
is
not
about
each
24-cent
payphone
call
individually.
this
is
a
properly
advocated
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
are.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
my
client
has
brought
scores
of
these
actions...
my
clients
have
brought
scores
of
these
actions,
some
before
the
fcc,
the
largest
ones...
and
this
is
the
largest
one
of
all...
in
federal
court
to
get
the
advantage
of
the
discovery
processes
in
federal
court.
most
of
these
cases
settle.
these
cases
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
are
about
analyzing
computer
records,
and
you
can
fight
to
the
death
or
you
can
say
let's
figure
out
who
owes
whom
what
and
let's
settle;
and
most
of
the
cases
settle.
there
is
no
reason
why
there
should
be
any
more
or
less
incentive
to
settle
when
the
case
is
before
the
fcc
than
when
it's
before
a
federal
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
this
case
was
brought
in
federal
court
under
a
statute
that
permits
the
plaintiffs
to
choose
whether
to
go
to
federal
supreme
court
or
the
fcc.
the
reason
it's
nine
years
old
is
not
because
we
didn't
sue
immediately;
it's
because
we've
been
litigating
for
nine
years
about
our
right
to
litigate.
does
the
fcc
have
a
useful
role
to
play
in
this
process
at
this
point?
never
say
never,
but
i
don't
see
one.
the
case
was
brought
in
federal
court
under
a
doctrine
that
has
always
allowed
assignees
for
collection
to
sue
in
federal
court,
and
there
is
no
reason
i
can
think
of
why
it
shouldn't
proceed
in
federal
court.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it's
one
lawsuit.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
we,
after
judge
sentelle
dismissed
this
case,
we
moved
to
the
alternative
to
amend
our
complaint
to
add
either
1,400
individual
plaintiffs
or
a
class
action.
the
plaintiffs
opposed
that,
and
then
she
reversed
herself
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that's
really
not
true,
justice
scalia.
just
it's
a
pure
practical
matter,
leaving
aside
theory,
this
is
about
analyzing
computer
databases.
this
is
about
analyzing
call
records.
because
of
the
system
the
fcc
set
up,
none
of
the
information
resides
with
the
psps;
it
resides
with
the
aggregators
and
with
the
carriers.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no,
i
disagree,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
it's
so
much
better
to
bring
it
on
behalf
of
individuals
who
have
expressly
consented
to
be
bound,
than
on
behalf
of
people
who
may
not
even
know
about
it
and
who
may
not
have
consented
to
be
bound
and
may
not
want
to
be
bound
as
in
the
typical
class
action.
there
are
all
sorts
of
problems
with
class
actions.
class
actions
are
typically
brought
by
enterprising
law
firms
who
may
not
ever
have
met
their
clients.
this
is
a
different
litigation
altogether.
this
is
litigation
by
a
trade
association
that
exists
to
collect
payphone
compensation,
doing
the
same
thing
it
always
does,
only
doing
it
in
court
on
behalf
of
1,400
companies
that
each
signed
an
agreement
saying
i
want
you
to
go
do
this
for
me
and
i
agree
to
be
bound
by
the
result.
so
i
can
get
entitlement
interest.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
push
the
parties
to
settle.
that's
what
rational
economics--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yeah,
the
client
says
millions
for
defense,
but
not
one
cent...
one
cent
for
tribute
and
every
lawyer
gets
happy,
because
the
client
wants
to
litigate
to
the
death
instead
of
just
surrendering
to
extortion,
in
that
kind
of
case
they
have
to
decide
whether
the
economically
rational
thing
is
to
set
a
bad
precedent
or
is
to
settle.
that
happens
all
the
day
for
defense
counsel
and
i'm
quite
often
defense
counsel--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
#
but
this
case
is
not
of
that
nature.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--prospectively.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
agree,
and
we
made
that
point
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
cert..
this
case
is
of
no
practical
significance
going
forward
for
the
body
of
the
law.
there's
nothing
this
court
is
going
to
decide
in
this
case
that's
going
to
make
a
difference.
people
will
just
draft
their
assignment
and--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--so
my
clients--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--article
iii
is
a
proper
and
important
limit
on
court
jurisdiction
when
it
restricts
court
jurisdiction.
when
we
have
a
traditional
cause
of
action,
the
abstractions
that
have
come
to
be
thought
of
as
article
iii
jurisprudence
don't
trump
tradition.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
what
article
iii--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--the...
on
the
assumption
on
which
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
aggregators'
injury
is
the
assigned
injury
of
the
assignors.
we
are
taking
the
principle
of
vermont
agency
and
saying
that
applies
just
as
much
to
assignees
for
collection
as
it
does
to
any
other
assignees.
contrary
to
mr.
phillips'
position
and
judge
sentelle's
position,
that
there
are
assignments
and
then
there
are
assignments,
the
law
has
looked
many
times
at
the
question
whether
there
are
assignments
and
then
there
are
assignments.
the
argument
that
assignees
for
collection
should
be
treated
differently
has
been
made
many
times.
it
has
never
prevailed
in
federal
court,
unless
and
until
it
prevails
in
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
oh,
it
would
make
a
huge
difference,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
if
we
assume
insolvency
and
we
assume
a
secured
creditor,
then,
yes,
i
think
the
psps
are
general
unsecured
creditors,
and
the
secured
creditor
is
in
line
ahead
of
them.
different
facts,
different
results.
but,
yes,
it
does
make
a
difference
if
the
assignee
enters
insolvency,
which
is
not
going
to
happen
in
this
case,
but
if
the
assignee
enters
insolvency
and
if
there
is
a
creditor
that
arguably
under
insolvency
principles
has
a
higher
claim
than
the
psps,
yes,
it
does
make
a
difference
to
the
assignee.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i'm
guessing
they
either
don't
report
them
as
income
or
they
report
them
as
income,
but
then
have
a
deduction
in
the
exact
same
amount.
but
i
really
don't
know
the
exact
answer
to
that.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
happens
the
same
way
it
happens
under
rule
23.
it
happens
the
same
way
it
happens
with
the
trustee
who
is
representing
people
who
would
otherwise
have
many
different
causes
of
action.
it's
a
very
common
thing
in
federal
court.
if
the...
if
a
bankruptcy
trustee
or
if
a
class
representative
brings
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
many
people,
then
there
is
one
cause
of
action
instead
of
the
many
causes
of
action
there
would
be
if
those
many
people
sued
directly.
it's
not
an
issue.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no
more
than
my
clients.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
my
clients
have
legal
obligations
that
they
have
to
discharge.
they
are
embodied
in
the
very
agreements
reproduced
in
the
back
of
the
red
brief,
that
require
us
to
pursue
this
action
and
require
us
to
turn
over--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--for
very
good
reasons.
rule
23
exists
to
protect
absent
plaintiffs,
something
we
don't
have
here,
and
to
protect
defendants
so
that
they
will
know
there
will
be
a
res
judicata
effect
of
the
judgment,
whether
for
them
or
against
them,
so
that
they
can't
be
sued
by
other
class
members.
they
have
those
protections.
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
blue
and
yellow
briefs
in
this
case,
they
keep
referring
in
the
abstract
to
the
protections
of
rule
23,
but
they
don't
identify
a
single
concrete
protection
that
they
do
not
have
under
this
system.
rule
23
is
inferior
to
an
action
by
assignees
for
collection
in
every
imaginable
way.
it's
not
a
superior
alternative.
and
to
say
that
the
existence
of
rule
23
means
we
should
throw
out
a
traditional
form
of
action
that's
been
recognized
for
well
over
a
century
would
be
a
very
surprising
result.
thank
you.
