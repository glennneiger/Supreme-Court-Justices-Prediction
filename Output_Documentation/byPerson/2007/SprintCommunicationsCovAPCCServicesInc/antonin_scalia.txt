justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again?
what
is
the
common
ground?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
this
is
not
really
a
very
significant
case,
is
it?
because
i
presume
that
these
enterprises
that
agglomerate
claims
and
bring
suit
as
a
collection
agency,
they
could
simply
get
their
compensation,
instead
of
by
way
of,
of
a
flat
fee,
by,
you
know,
claiming
entitlement
to
2
percent
of
the
rewards.
so
it's
no
big
deal,
i
mean,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
ahead,
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
all
of
the
claimants
assign
their
claims
to
something
called
an
agglomeration
trust
and
the...
the
person
who's
bringing
suit
here
brings
it
as
a
trustee?
he
has
no
interest
in
it
personally
and
he
is
compensated
the
same
way,
the
same
way
this
agglomerator
is
compensated.
he
has
no
personal
interest.
he
could
sue,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
once
again,
it's
no
big
deal.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
do
you
do
about...
about
aggregated
plaintiffs
who
are
not
in
the
field
of
federal
regulation?
they're
just
sort
of
out
of
luck?
can
they
petition
for
the
creation
of
an
fcc
that
they
can
take
their
claims
to?
i
mean,
this
is
a
fluke
that
there
happens
to
be
this
federal
agency
they
could
have
gone
to.
certainly
our
principles
of
standing
should
not
depend
upon
that
fluke,
should
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
also
not
one
in
which
the
issue
of
standing
was
raised
and
decided.
and
our
jurisprudence
says
that
where
we
do
not
address
the
issue
of
standing
the
case
has
no
precedential
value
on
the
subject.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
consider
two
decisions
an
enormous
body.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
count
the
lower
courts.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
earliest
of
those
cases
in
our
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
earliest
case
in
our
court
that
upholds
this
that,
without
specifically
addressing
the
standing
issue,
gives
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
1920?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
vermont
agency,
in
the
vermont
agency
case,
which
dealt
with
qui
tam,
that
many
people,
including
the
justice
department,
thought
did
not
confer
article
iii
standing,
we
held
to
the
contrary
that
it
did
confer
article
iii
standing,
mainly
because
it
had
been
around
forever.
it
was...
it
was
the
understood
part
of
the
judicial
power
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
do
you
have
any
case
prior
to
1920
in
which
english
courts
or
even
early
american
courts
thought
that
this,
that
this
would
be
sufficient
to
bring
a
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
more
than
a
wrinkle.
the
assignee
keeps
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
earliest
federal
court
case
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
late
19th
century?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
under
the
same
misimpression,
i
have
to
say,
and
i
wrote
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
must
say
we
seem
to
have
come
full
circle
from
flash
v.
cohen,
which
said
that
the
doctrine
of
standing
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
article
iii.
that
it
all...
the
only
thing
it's
there
for
is
to
assure
that
concrete
adverseness
on
which
our
adversary
system
depends.
you've
come
full
circle
from
that
to
now
your
argument
that
concrete
adverseness
doesn't
matter
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
combination
of
the
two
that's
possible,
that
maybe
one
of
the
elements
of
article
iii
standing
is
that
both
parties
have
a
stake
in
winning
and
losing?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for
counterclaims.
he
says
i
have
some
counterclaims.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
englert,
is
this
one
lawsuit
or
1,400
lawsuits,
or
however
many
clients
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
it
be...
how
is
it
one
lawsuit
when
there
are,
i
mean,
just
a
lot
of
different
individual
claims?
you
think
you
could
have
brought
this
as
a
class
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
opposed
it
on
what
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
ground,
that
each
of
these
claims
is
quite
different.
there
are
different
calls,
different...
different
amounts
owing.
each
case
is
not
going
to
be
judged
on
the
same...
on
the
same
facts.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
englert,
could
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
englert,
can
you
explain
to
me
again
how
it
is
that
when
you
acquire
14
separate
choses
in
action,
14
separate
claims,
against
the
same
defendant,
just
by
your
acquiring
them
they
sort
of
melt
into
one
cause
of
action.
how
does
that...
how
does
that
happen?
