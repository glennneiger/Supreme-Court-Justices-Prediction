justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mentioned
discovery.
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
get
discovery
against
this
whole
bunch
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
subpoenas
out
there
and
depositions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
this
particular
situation
you
can
do
the
same
thing.
you
can
file
requests
for
admissions
or
serve
interrogatories.
i
don't
understand
why
you
can't
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
assume
the
aggregators
have
the
relevant
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
assume
the
aggregator
would
have
the
relevant
information.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
to...
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
case
and
i
assume
they
have
to
investigate
the
facts
and
be
prepared
for
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
fact
question?
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
here.
i
probably
should
have
asked
mr.
phillips.
but
what
issues
in
fact
are
there
going
to
be
in
this
case?
it
seems
to
me
everything
ought
to
be
on
computer
somewhere,
and
it's
just
a
matter
of
pushing
the
right
button
and
you
know
how
much
money
you
owe.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
every
member
of
the
so-called
class
here
has
individually
agreed
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which...
the
assignees,
but
the
assignors
have
agreed
to
be
bound--
