justice
david
h.
souter
he
would
do
the
same
thing
in
justice
scalia's
example
if
it
were
an
irrevocable
trust.
the
trust
could
do
exactly
what
the
aggregator
is
doing
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
might
protect
those
who
assigned
their
interest
to
the
trust,
but
i
don't
offhand
see
what
difference
it
would
make,
what
difference
those
responsibilities
would
make
vis
a
vis
you
and
your
client.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
real
issue
is
not
whether
the
trustee
can
sue.
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
trust
can
sue.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
in
his
example
if
the
trust
can
sue,
why
can't
the
aggregator
sue?
and
your
answer
was,
well,
trustees
have
certain
responsibilities.
but
i
don't
see
that
those
responsibilities
inure
to
the
benefit
of
your
client
or
to
an
opposing
party
in
litigation
that
a
trust
brings.
so
i
don't
see
how
it
would
differentiate
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
explain
that?
that
really
goes
back
to
your
answer
in
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
i'm
not
getting
it.
she
said
why
would
you
go
to
the
federal
court
if
you
can
you
go
to
the
fcc,
and
you
said,
well,
you
get
the
benefits
of
being
in
federal
court.
what...
i
should
be
asking
other
counsel
this
question,
but
as
you
understand
it
what
is
the
benefit
of
being
in
the
federal
court
rather
than
the
fcc
that
makes
this
so
attractive?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
don't
know
of
any
benefits?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
know
of
any
benefits?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
eliminate
step
one.
i
mean,
you
go
to
the
fcc,
you
win
there,
then
you've
got
to
face
an
appeal
before
the
federal
courts.
why
not
go
right
to
the
federal
courts
immediately?
you
eliminate
one
level
of
litigation.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
also
pay
a
price.
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
going
to
get
at.
talking
about
prudential
standing,
1400
filing
fees
is
pretty
prudential.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
sorry.
the
only
way,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you
can
eliminate
what
you
regard
as
a
problem
is
by
having
1400
separate
actions,
so
that
in
any
given
case
if
you
want
discovery,
your
plaintiff,
the
person
who
has
got
to
provide
that
discovery,
is
standing
right
there.
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
the
benefits
that
you
are
claiming
entitled
to
without
having
1400
separate
actions.
if
you
don't
have
1400
separate
actions,
whether
you
have
an
aggregation
like
this,
whether
you
have
a
joint
action,
whether
you
have
a
class
action,
this
problem
of
chasing
down,
as
you
describe
it,
is
going
to
be
there.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
prudential
question
for
this
court
is:
do
we
really
want
to
require
1400
separate
actions
so
that
you
can
have
your
perfect
paradigm
of
private
litigation?
and
to
say,
yes,
we
want
1400
actions,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
stretch.
what
do
you
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
does
that
have
to
do
with...
i
guess
that
goes
to
prudential
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
article
iii
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
if
we
get
to
the
prudential-standing
point,
the
answer
is
that
in
the
absence
of
a
rule
comparable
to
rule
23
we
should
not
recognize
prudential
standing,
but
that
if
we
adopted
a
rule
that
sort
of
regulated
how
this
would
work,
prudential
standing
would
be
appropriate?
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
englert,
with
respect
to
what
weight
we
should
give
to
those
decisions,
i
just
want
to
put
a
simple
hypo
and
i'll
ask
a
question
on
it.
assume
that
in
this
case
the
assignment...
well,
assume
another
case,
rather,
in
which
the
assignment
is
identical
is
identical
to
this
one,
except
that
the
terms
of
the
second
agreement,
i.e.,
if
i
the
aggregator
collect
anything
i
give
it
to
you.
assume
that
is
part
of
the
first
agreement,
so
that
there
is
an
assignment
and
as
part
of
the
assigning
document
there
is
a
stated
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
assignee
to
pay
all
proceeds
to
the
assignor.
i
am
assuming
that
your
position
would
be
the
same;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
my
question
is,
you're
taking
that
position,
i
think,
just
as
you
did
in
response
to
justice
scalia,
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
a
huge
body
of
law
that
assignment
for
collection
conveys
adequate
standing.
but
are
any
of
the
assignment
for
collection
cases
in
that
body
of
law
clearly
cases
like
the
one
in
my
hypothetical
in
which
the
assignment
itself
by
its
terms
requires
the
total
payment
of
any
benefit
back
to
the
assignor?
