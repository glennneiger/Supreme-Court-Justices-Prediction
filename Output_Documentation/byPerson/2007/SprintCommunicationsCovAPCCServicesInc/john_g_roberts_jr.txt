chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
07-552,
sprint
communications
company
v.
apcc
services,
inc..
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
these
contracts
provided
that
the
aggregators
will
turn
over
all
of
the
proceeds
of
the
litigation
except
for
one
penny,
then
you'd
be
satisfied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
englert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we're
not
under
any
body
of
law.
i
didn't
see
any
cases
cited
after
we
had
more
carefully
explicated
our
understanding
of
article
iii.
what's
the
latest
case
from
this
court
that
you've
got?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
there
is
no
reason
for
concern
about
the
absence
of
concrete
adverseness.
but
i
would
have
thought
there
was
a
great
deal
of
reason
for
concern
and
that
your
client
doesn't
care
if
he
wins
or
loses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
all
the
same
to
him.
if
he
wins,
he
doesn't
get
to
keep
the
money;
if
he
loses,
he
loses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
the
question
came
to
us
on
the
assumption
that
he
doesn't
retain
any
of
the
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
our
cases
made
clear
that
that
kind
of...
i
forget
what
we
call
it...
it's
a
separate
interest
from
the
injury
that
you're
alleging
in
the
lawsuit.
you
don't
allege
in
the
lawsuit
that
the
basis
for
article
iii
injury
is
that
you're
in
this
line
of
work
and
if
the
work
dries
up
you're
in
big
trouble.
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
support
article
iii
standing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
then
why
is
the
assignee
bringing
the
lawsuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
had
no
independent
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
we
got
off
the
track
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
assignee's
injury
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
how
it's
redressed
by
the
receipt
of
the
money.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
but
you
know,
vermont
agency,
obviously,
the
assignee
recovers
something
himself,
that
he
gets
to
keep
the
bounty.
here
that's
not
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
sierra
club
protect...
undertakes
activities
to
protect
the
environment,
but
that
doesn't
give
it
standing
in
every
environmental
case
to
sue.
it
needs
to
show
members
what
the
concrete
interest
and
so
on.
the
fact
that
your
client
is
in
the
business
of
suing
on
behalf
of
payphone
operators--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--speaking...
speaking--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
speaking
of
one
cent
for
tribute,
it's
easy
to
get
rid
of
this
problem,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
your
agreements
just
say
you
get
to
keep
$10
out
of
every
sum
that
your
recover?
then
we
wouldn't
have
this
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--why
doesn't
the
tie
go
to
article
iii?
i
mean
if
it
makes
no
difference
either
way
i'd
like
to
preserve
significance
of
article
iii
as
a
limit
on
court
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
article
iii
does
trump
tradition.
i
mean,
if
it
doesn't
meet
article
iii,
no
amount
of
tradition
can
save
it.
and
you
several
times
refer,
when
asked
one
of
these
questions,
to
the
tradition
and
the
old
cases,
but
i
haven't
heard
an
answer
yet
to
the
concrete
injury
that
is
suffered
by
the
aggregators.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
class
action,
the
trustee,
you
know,
the
named
plaintiff,
the
named
trustee
has
concrete
injury
and
redressability
to
themselves?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
very
much
more
than
your
clients.
the
trustee
has
legal
obligations
that
he
has
to
discharge.
if
it's
a
suit
that
he
has
to
bring
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiaries
and
doesn't
do
it,
he
is
sued
for
breach
of
trust.
in
a
class
action
case,
the
representative
has
to
have
standing,
has
to
show
concrete
injury
and
redressability.
here
we
don't
have
any
of
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
three
minutes,
mr.
phillips.
you
might
start
by
the
point
your
friend
just
made.
what
is
the
protection
that
rule
23
provides
that
you
don't
have?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
0-552,
sprint
communications
versus
apcc
services.
