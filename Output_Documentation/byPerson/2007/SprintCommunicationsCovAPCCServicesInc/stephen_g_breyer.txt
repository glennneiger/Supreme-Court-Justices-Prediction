justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
a
discovery
problem.
i
don't
see
that
it's
a
standing
problem.
and
two
things
it
reminds
me
of
are,
one
very
common,
a
financer
takes
an
interest
in
receivables
and
he's
going
to
have
to
collect
them
as
receivables
and
there
may
be
50,000.
that
could
have
the
same
kind
of
practical
problems.
or
we
had
cases
in
the
first
circuit
you
may
or
may
not
be
aware
of
where
somebody
went
around
and
had
assignments
for
50,000
cabbages
that
were
delivered
a
day
late
in
50,000
box
cars
and
each
one
was
worth
about
$10.
nobody
figured
a
way
out
of
that.
they
had
to
pass
a
special
statute.
there
was...
and
so
it
seems
to
me
you're
better
off
than
the
cabbage
people
because
have
you
two
possible
remedies:
one
on
discovery;
you
could
ask
the
judge,
judge,
see
what
the
communications
commission
thinks.
it's
called
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
kind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
could
go
to
the
fcc
and
you
say,
fcc,
you
got
us
into
this.
now,
you
have
some
rules
here
that
make
some
sense
in
terms
of
collection.
you
have
both
those
agency
avenues
open
to
you,
not
open
to
the
cabbage
people,
and
this
doesn't
seem
a
standing
problem.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
on
that
very
point...
i
need
clarification
on
this.
how
is
that
different
than
the
case
of
the
financer
who
takes
accounts
receivable,
which
is
very
common?
you
finance
the
accounts.
you
take
a
secured
interest
in
accounts
receivable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
you
might
foreclose
on
the
secured
interests.
then
you
as
the
financer
have
to
collect
from
everybody.
how
is
your
case
different
from
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
respect
you
were
just
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
mean,
there
may
be
many
reasons
for
that.
i'm
just
saying
it's
a
normal,
practical
problem,
i
believe,
in
the
banking
community.
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
back
to
my
question,
i'd
like
to
get
an
answer
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
respect
to
the
problem
you
were
just
mentioning,
the
discovery
problem
of
counterclaims
or
those
problems,
is
this
case
any
different
than
the
financing
case
i
just
mentioned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
i
guess
it
could
be
that
you're
asking
them
to
go
back
into
records
that
are
somewhat
old.
what
you're
asking
to
find
out
is...
is
every
call
made
out
of
a
payphone
that
was
long
distance
call,
and
we
don't
even
know
who
actually
turned
out
to
be
the
carrier.
it's
like
asking
them,
tell
us
exactly
on
the
payphone
at
that
corner
over
there
who
was
called
at
9:15
a.m.
to
some
number
in
1987,
and
maybe
they
should
have
records
of
that
but
they
don't.
they
have
estimates--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
say
maybe
the
time
necessary
to
go
through
those
records,
to
figure
out
whether
you
should
give
12
cents
to
the
person
who
ran
that
payphone,
is
really
not
worth
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
if
they
are
right
in
some
claim
like
that,
is
there
a
way
to
get
this
worked
out
at
the
fcc?
i
mean,
it...
it...
i
don't
think
it
was
the
purpose
of
this
statute
to
have
12
cent
claims,
even
aggravated,
brought
back
years
later
under
some
set
of
procedural
rule
that
will
be
so
expensive
to
get
the
discovery
that
this
just
won't
be
worth
it.
now
that
might
be
right.
and
if
it
is
right
or
whether
it's
right,
can
the
fcc
work
this
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
aware
of
that
system.
i'm
aware
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
but
my
question
is
to
get
to
that
figure
there
may
be
billions
of
calls,
for
all
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
could
be
quite
expensive
to
track
down
each
of
those
calls
individually.
i
don't
know
if
it
is
or
not;
but
if
it
is,
is
there
a
way
to
get
this
problem
worked
out
at
the
fcc
or
do
we
have
the
cabbage
case
grown
large?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
settlement
they
may
work
out.
but
if
it
is...
for
example
costs
a
dollar
to
fight
a
claim
that's
worth
12
cents,
individually,
before
you
get
to
billions,
they
don't
want
to
be
in
that
situation
where
they
are
really
paying
money
for
nothing;
because
in
their
opinion
they
already
paid.
i
mean
we
understand
this
kind
of
problem.
so
i
go
back
to
my
question.
they
have
one
view
of
it;
you
have
another
of
what's
going
on
here.
and
their
view
is
very
unfavorable
to
your
clients
and
your
clients'
view
is
very
unfavorable
to
their
clients.
so
i
would
like
to
know
is
there
a
way
to
get
this
worked
out
at
the
fcc?
maybe
that
will
turn
out
not
to
be
relevant
in
this
case
but
i'd
still
like
to
know
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you...
this
is
giving
me
a
thought
here.
just
a
total
imaginary
case,
nothing
to
do
with
your
clients.
put
yourself
in
the
opposite
position.
suppose
you
were
representing
a
defendant
and
that
defendant
were
asked
by
this
imaginary
plaintiff
to
dig
up
records
on
the
computer.
to
dig
up
each
individual
record
costs
$1,
there
were
billions
of
such
records,
and
the
value
to
you,
to
the
other
side,
the
plaintiff,
imaginary
in
this
case,
was
12
cents
a
call.
okay?
so
you
say
look,
those
people
are
asking
us
to
dig
up
billions
of
records,
it's
going
to
cost
us
a
dollar
each
to
do
it,
and
all
they
are
going
to
get
out
of
it
is
12
cents
a
call.
but
of
course
we
are
the
ones
who
have
to
pay
the
dollar,
and
they
get
the
12
cents.
now,
is
there
a
way
for
the
legal
system
to
solve
that
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
other
than
standing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
defendant
says...
now
your
client,
i
am
not
going
to
settle;
there
are
no
such
claims.
this
is
ridiculous
but
it's
going
to
cost
me
a
dollar
to
prove
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
very
complicated
case
involving
standing
in
a
communications
law
matter.
now,
the
federal
communications
law
requires
long
distance
communications
carriers
to
reimburse
payphone
operators
for
connecting
certain
long
distance
calls
made
at
their
payphones,
and
the
payphone
operators
may
bring
suit,
if
the
long
distance
carriers
don't
pay
them
what
they
owe,
so
we
had
a
lot
of
people
suing
the
carriers.
in
the
litigation
before
us,
about
1400
payphone
operators
who
had
claims
against
the
carriers
assigned
their
claims
to
firms,
for
billing
and
collection
firms
and
they're
called
“aggregators.”
they
aggregate
a
lot
of
claims
and
they
file
a
lawsuit.
now,
these
aggregators
here
agreed
to
accept
the
assignments
of
the
claims
from
the
payphone
operators
and
they
also
agreed
to
remit
the
proceeds
to
the
payphone
operators
if
they
won
in
the
litigation
and
they're
going
to
get
a
fee
for
their
services.
the
question
is,
do
these
aggregators,
who
are
assignees
of
legal
claims
for
money
owed
to
the
payphone
operators
and
promise
to
pay
the
money
they
get
back
to
the
payphone
operators,
do
they
have
standing
to
pursue
the
claims
in
a
federal
court?
the
lower
court
said
yes,
they
do
have
standing,
and
we
agree,
at
least
five
of
us
do.
we've
said
that
constitutional
standing
requires
a
plaintiff
to
have
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome.
and
we
more
or
less
have
defined
that
to
say
that
that
person,
the
plaintiff
has
to
have
suffered
an
injury
that
the
defendant
caused
in
which
the
courts
can
redress.
now,
nobody
doubts
the
assignee
could
bring
this
lawsuit
if
he
had
the
right
to
keep
even
a
small
amount
of
the
money
he
got
as
a
recovery,
because
he
is
taking
over
the
injury
from
the
payphone
operator
and
he
is
bringing
the
suit
to
get
the
redress,
he'd
get
the
redress.
if
he
kept
it,
everything
will
be
fine.
but
he
doesn't
keep
any
of
it.
he
turns
it
all
over
to
the
assigned
one.
does
that
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
standing?
to
find
the
answer
to
that
question,
we
examined
legal
history
and
the
reason
we
did
was
because
the
case-or-controversy
requirement
in
article
iii,
which
is
what
leads
to
the
standing
requirement,
is
typically
informed
by
history,
the
history
of
what
kinds
of
matters
traditionally
have
been
appropriate
for
courts
to
hear.
and
that
history
shows
some
of
us
that
courts,
really
in
order
to
help
facilitate
trade
and
commerce,
that's
where
this
came
from
in
the
18th
century,
that
they
have
allowed
assignees
to
bring
lawsuits,
including
assignees
who
posses
nothing
but
a
pure
legal
title
because
those
assignees
have
promised
to
give
the
proceeds
of
any
recovery
to
others.
and
they
call
the
assignee
in
such
a
case
--
they
call
them
an
assignee
for
collection.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
saying
the
assignee
for
collection
really
exists
and
they
have
standing.
the
long
distance
carriers
offer
no
convincing
reason
to
depart
from
this
historic
tradition,
suits
by
assignees,
including
assignees
for
collection
in
commercial
cases.
we
found
some
cases
went
the
other
way,
but
the
majority
went
the
way
we
say.
and
so,
we
think
that
the
aggregators
have
satisfied
the
article
iii
standing
requirements.
they
have
established
an
injury
in
fact,
the
long
distance
carriers
caused
the
injury,
the
injuries
will
be
redressed
if
they
win.
and
we
find
too
that
they
satisfy
the
prudential
standing
requirements
which
were
other
things
would
go
into
in
the
opinion.
and
we
note
that
this
is
all
a
commercial
matter,
it's
all
in
the
context
of
business
arrangements,
business
purposes
and
there
is
no
claim
that
this
is
somehow
a
bad
faith
matter.
now,
all
this
is
explained
in
excruciating
length
in
our
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia,
thomas,
and
alito
have
joined.
