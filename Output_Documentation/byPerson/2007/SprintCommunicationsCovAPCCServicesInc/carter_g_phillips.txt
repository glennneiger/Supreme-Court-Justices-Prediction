mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
chief
judge
sentelle
observed
in
his
dissent
below
that
there
are
assignments
and
there
are
assignments,
and
that's
essentially
going
to
be
the
theme
of
my
presentation
this
morning.
it
is
i
think
common
ground
between
the
parties
in
this
litigation
that
if
you
have
an
assignment
which
represents
the
grant
of
the
entirety
of
both
the
right
and
the
remedy,
that
is
the
complete
assignment
of
the
chosen
action,
then
under
those
circumstances
there's
no
question
that
the
assignee
has
standing
under
article
iii.
by
parity
of
receiving,
if
all
that
the
assignee
receives
is
a
power
of
attorney,
a
mere
collection
agency
role,
under
those
circumstances
i
think
it's
common
ground
between
the
parties
that
article
iii
is
not
satisfied.
two
of
the
data
points
come
from--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
the
second
part
of
the
common
ground
is
that
if
all
that
the
assignee
receives
is
the
power
of
attorney,
that
is
to
serve
as
the
lawyer
for
the
assignor,
under
those
circumstances
the
assignee
doesn't...
cannot...
has
no
common
stake
than
i
or
my
clients
do
in
these
particular
cases,
any
more
than
i
do
in
my
client's
interest
in
these
particular
cases,
and
there
i
don't
think
anybody
disputes
that
article
iii
is
not
satisfied.
now,
the
court
in
vermont
agency
sort
of
identified
two
additional
data
points.
first
of
all,
it
made
clear
that
a
10
percent
bounty
by
itself
unattached
to
anything
else
is
not
sufficient,
largely
i
think
for
the
same
reasons
why
the
lawyer's
claim
is
insufficient,
because
that's
not
tied
to
the
particular
right
at
stake
and
therefore
is
inadequate
to
allow
article
iii
to
the
satisfied.
the
second
half
of
it
is,
though,
that
if
that
bounty
is
coupled
with
an
assignment
of
the
rights
and
even
if
that's
a
partial
assignment
of
the
rights,
then
there
is
article
iii
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
sure
i'd
be
satisfied.
i
think
there's
a
different...
i
think
the
answer
is
that
might
satisfy
article
iii.
the
only
reason
i'm
reluctant
to
say
that
that's
the
line
that
ought
to
be
drawn
is
because
this
court's
taxpayer
standing
cases
seems
to
recognize
that
there
are
situations
where
there
is
a
sufficiently
de
minimis
amount
of
at
stake
that
under
those
circumstances
article
iii
won't
be
satisfied.
but
clearly
the
cleanest
line
to
draw
is
in
circumstances
where
have
you
no
stake
in
the
outcome
that
clearly
is
beyond
what
article
iii
would
ultimately
do.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
is
a
big
deal,
not
necessarily
because
of
the
importance
of
the
article.
i
think
the
article
iii
part
of
it
is
still
a
big
deal.
i
think
requiring
as
a
separation
of
powers
matter
that
there
has
to
be
a
concrete
stake
in
the
party
bringing
the
litigation,
that's
an
important
principle
and
the
court
shouldn't
abandon
it,
and
that's
posed
directly
in
this
case.
but
more
fundamentally
in
terms
of
the
importance
of
the
underlying
process,
remember
here
we're
talking
about
an
assignee
who
takes
on
1400
different
assignor
claims
involving
400,000
pay
phones.
and
that's
the
problem,
is
that
when
you
break
this
down
and
you
allow
just
simple
assignments
to
satisfy
article
iii
in
its
prudential
standing
concerns,
then
what
you
end
up
with
is
this
mass
tort
litigation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
and
i
would...
i
would
still
assert
those
same
prudential
objections
in
the
hypothetical
you
pose.
what
i'm
saying
is
when
you...
when
you
have
an
assignment
and
there
is
a
bounty
built
into
it,
however
you
want
to
define
the
bounty,
whether
it's
a
penny
or
10
percent
or
2
percent
or
whatever,
that
may
satisfy
article
iii.
i
understand
that.
that
does
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
there's
prudential
standing
under
those
circumstances.
in
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
that
context,
justice
ginsburg,
you
do
have
the
problems.
you
don't
get
the
discovery.
you
don't
get
to
use
the
efficiency
of
the
counterclaim
process,
and
there
are
serious
questions
about
whether
or
not
there
are
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
effects,
and
i
would
argue
in
that
context
that
there's
a
very
significant
claim
that
those
proceedings
ought
not
to
be
entertained
by
a
federal
court
as
a
prudential
matter,
not
as
a
matter
of
article
iii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
there
is
a
long
tradition
of
allowing
trustees
to
bring
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
trust
because
that's
the
only
way
that
a
trust
can
in
fact
enforce
its
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
is
a
big
deal,
because
trust
relationships
carry
all
kinds
of
additional
legal
consequences.
what
is
particularly
offensive
about
this
arrangement,
your
honors,
is
that
the
assignor
gets
all
of
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
bring
mass
tort
litigation
with
none
of
the
responsibilities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true,
but
there
are
additional
trust
responsibilities
that
would
attach
to
that
process.
there's
an
entire
legal
regime
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
again,
justice
souter,
i
think
the
answer
probably
is
going
to
depend
on
how
the
court
interprets
the
prudential
standing
doctrine.
again,
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
as
an
article
iii
matter,
because
i
think
it's
one
of
those
long-held
traditions
that
trustees
are
allowed
to
bring
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
trust
and
that's
understood.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i
mean,
that's
where
the
claims
are,
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
two
differentiations.
one
is
that
there
is
this
entire
legal
regime
that
regulates
trusts
and
that
has
allowed
the
courts
for
200
years,
probably
longer
than
that,
to
be
comfortable
to
allow
litigation
to
proceed
in
a
particular
way.
but
second
of
all
and
the
second
answer
to
your
first
question
is
the
prudential
concerns
remain
just,
potentially
just
as
serious.
i
think
the
question
is
do
you
want
to
create
litigation
devices
that
allow
the
courts
to
avoid...
to
allow
lower
courts
or,
more
to
the
point,
allow
plaintiffs
to
avoid
the
requirements
either
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23
or
the
associational
standing
doctrine.
those
are
doctrines
that
are
designed
to
limit
mass
tort
litigation
in
particularized
circumstances--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
they're
not
a
party
to
the
litigation.
i
mean,
you
can
get
discovery--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice
stevens,
if
you
sue
me,
you
hail
me
into
court,
you
put
me
to
the
burdens
of
being
a
defendant
in
litigation,
the
least
i
ought
to
get
out
of
that
is
that
i
can
turn
to
you
and
ask
you
to
admit
certain
facts,
i
can
turn
to
you
and
ask
you
to
answer
certain
interrogatories,
and
i
don't
have
to
go
chasing
you
down,
because
you've
already
submitted
yourself
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
can
serve
them
on
the
aggregator,
but
i
cannot
serve
them
on
the
party
who
in
fact
has
the
relevant
information
that
i
need.
i
have
to
use
third
party
subpoena
power.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
some
instances
it
might
or
it
might
not.
the
problem
is
the
aggregator
has
got
to
get
the
information.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that
would
help
on
the
affirmative
case
that
they
have
to
put
together,
but
it
doesn't
help
with
respect
to
the
counterclaims.
the
qwest
amicus
brief
does
a
very
nice
job
of
explaining
that
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
where
the...
where
the
payphone
operators
are
overpaid
and
it's
very
difficult...
first
of
all,
and
the
aggregator
has
no
idea
or
any
incentive
to
find
out
any
of
that,
any
of
that
information.
and
when
qwest
made
the
requests
of
the
aggregator
saying,
provide
me
with
the
information,
the
brief
quotes
in
a
variety
of
places
comments
such
as,
you
know,
"whatever
the...
our
aggregator
says
is
fine
with
us.
"
or
"i
don't
care
about
those
claims.
"
or
answers
like
that,
which,
if
i
sue
you...
i
mean,
if
you
sue
me
and
i
ask
for
those,
you
cannot
give
me
back
those
answers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
if
it's
a
simple
assignee
for
a
debt
and
nothing
more
than
that,
just
a
power
of
attorney...
or
are
you
talking
about
a
full
assignment?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
in
no
circumstance--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
at
least
there
he
is
also
responsible
for
both...
he
has
the
entirety
of
the
right.
he
has
the
right
and
the
remedy.
so
that
whatever
counterclaims
you
have
operate
directly
against
that
particular
individual.
but
even
in
that
context,
justice
kennedy,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
fundamental
difference,
as
a
matter
of
prudence,
between
dealing
with
a
single
assignee
back
and
forth
and
the
disputes
that
arise
there
and
the
difficulty
of
discovery
that
would
exist
there,
and
the
situation
we
have
here
where
you
have
1400
payphone
operators--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but,
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
are
two
elements
of
the
standing
problem:
the
first
one
is
we're
all...
let's
be
clear...
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
that's
different
from
this
case
because
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
where
in
fact
the
assignee
has
a
concrete
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
dispute.
here
the
assignee
has
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
this
dispute.
so
the
article
iii
problem
arises
there.
the
question
is
if
you
have
a
minor
amount
at
interest,
even
if
it's,
you
know,
concrete
but
nevertheless
approaches
de
minimis,
should
you
nevertheless
entertain
that
case.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
that
instead
of
making
this
into
a
federal
court
case,
where
you
have
1400
claims
like
this,
what
the
court
should
say
is
that
the
better
course
to
follow
is
in
fact
for
the
plaintiffs
to
take
their
claims,
if
they
want
to,
in
an
aggregate
form
to
the
fcc
because
that's
the
right
institution
to
deal
with
it
because
it
doesn't
have
the
limitations
of
article
iii
and
it
doesn't
have
the
limitations
of
prudential
standing
to
interfere
with
its
ability
to
provide
complete
relief.
and,
indeed,
if
you
read
the
respondents'
brief,
they
identify,
as
the
prototype
litigation,
in
which
this
entire
system
worked
effectively,
a
claim
that
was
in
fact
litigated
in
front
of
the
federal
communications
commission,
not
a
case
that
was
litigated
in
front
of
the
federal
court.
so,
to
my
mind,
the
right
answer
to
this
case
is
to
take
these
cases
all
to
the
fcc,
not
as
a
matter
of
what
we
do
as
primary
jurisdiction,
but
simply
as
what
the
plaintiffs
do
because
they
don't
have
the
vehicle
to
bring
this
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
when
the
court
is
considering
the
questions
of
prudence,
you
know,
it
can
certainly
take
it
into
account,
and
maybe
that
would
argue
in
the
alternative
in
another
case
if
there
weren't
such
an
available
vehicle
that
the
court
might
be
more
inclined
to
entertain
it
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
spiller.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
spiller,
and
i
think
it's
a
logical
outgrowth
of
what
the
court
held
in
asarco,
which
is
that,
even
though
a
claim
doesn't
start
with
article
iii
jurisdiction
because
it's
not
an
article
iii
entity,
that
when
a
final
determination
comes
out
of
that
entity
that
is
in
fact
enforceable
as
a
right
that
that
right
is
enforceable
consistent
with
article
iii
notions.
and
that's
true.
that
is
what
the
court
essentially,
without
dealing
with
article
iii
at
all,
said
in
spiller,
and
that's
clearly
what
the
court
held
in
asarco.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
from
my
perspective
or
from
the
plaintiffs'
perspective.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the...
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
payphone
operators,
get
a
free
pass
in
this
proceeding.
they
get
all
of
the
benefits
of
being
able
to
go
to
federal
court
and
bring
litigation
with
none
of
the
burdens
of
having
to
deal
with
discovery
or
cross-claims
or
counterclaims
or
even
necessarily
being
bound
by
doctrines
of
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel.
so
you
get
all
the
benefits
and
none
of
the
disadvantages.
that's
why
it's
an
advantage
for
them
to
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
when--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
well,
i
mean,
the
real
question
is
i
don't
know
why
that
case
is
necessarily
in
federal
court
either.
i
mean,
a
lot
of
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
most
of
that's
litigated
in
state
courts,
in
which
case
there's
no
serious
problem--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--certainly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
those
exact
problems
would
arise
in
that
context
as
well.
on
the
other
hand,
that's
a
situation
that
seems
to
me
is
largely
driven
by
the
exigencies
and
by
accident
in
federal
court.
this
is
situation
that
is
driven
into
federal
court
by
the
plaintiffs'
choice
and
by
the
ability
and
the
preference
to
be
in
a
position
to
get
the
benefits
of
litigation
in
federal
court
without
any
of
the
detriments
that
might
otherwise
arise
in
that
context.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
guess
i
would
encourage
you
to
ask
counsel
on
the
other
side,
because
personally
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
a
full
and
fair
remedy--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know...
well,
other
than
the
ones
i've
already
articulated,
where
i
think
they
get
some
advantages
of
being
in
a
federal
court
and
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
and
that
may
well
be
his
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
there
is
article
iii.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
let's
not
lose
sight
of
that
core
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
may
or
may
not
have
happen.
but
let's
be
clear,
okay.
the
core
question
here
is
whether
or
not
an
aggregator
who
has
no
claim,
who
has
no
stake
at
all,
not
a
penny's
worth,
can
pursue
this
litigation.
on
that
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
got...
should
be
no.
there's
no
benefit
to
it.
the
concrete
stake
is
a
core
requirement
of
article
iii
and
the
court
ought
to
enforce
it
as
a
separation
of
powers
question.
the
issue
that
we've
been
discussing
here
is
what
do
you
do
when
you
get
past
that,
and
when
you
have
a
kind
of
a
bounty
that's
been
attached
to
it,
and
how
do
you
resolve
that?
in
that
situation,
which
is
not
this
case,
i
still
think
that
there
would
be
grounds
for
prudential
standing
to
serve
as
a
basis
to
eliminate
this
kind
of
litigation.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
mean,
the
price
you
pay...
bless
you...
is
that
when
you
bring
federal
court
litigation...
is
that
you
have
to
have...
you
have
to
expose
yourself
to
exactly
the
burdens
that
come
with
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
federal
courts
clearly
have
an
interest
in
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
can
join
in
a
single
complaint.
you
know,
the
court
can
consider
whether
or
not
it
thinks
joinder
is
appropriate
under
those
circumstances,
but
they
could
unquestionably
do
that.
but
then,
again,
they
are
then
at
that
point
a
plaintiff
in
the
litigation
having
brought
this
action
and,
therefore,
subject
to
all
of
the
burdens
of
being
a
plaintiff
in
the
litigation,
including
submitting
themselves
to
the
personal
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
i
mean,
let's
be
clear
about
this.
there
are
1400
names
out
of
people
all
over
the
country
that
under
the...
under
the
plaintiffs
aggregators'
theory
we
have
to
go
chase
down
in
order
to
obtain
discovery,
to
obtain
any
of
our
counterclaims
or
anything
like
that.
whereas
if
they
come
into
this
court
and
they
submit
themselves
to
the
jurisdiction,
at
least
the
process
works
as
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
doubt
that
the
trial
court
can
do
that,
but
the
question
is:
why
do
we
have
to
go
to
the
burden
of
having
to
chase
all
of
that
in
the
first
instance?
i
mean,
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
10
criticizes
us
for
not
having
brought
1400
third-party
complaints,
not
having
sought
additional
discovery.
all
of
those
are
burdens
that
simply
arise
in
this
context
that
otherwise
do
not
exist
in
an
ordinary
case
where
you
simply
ask
the
party
who
has
the
actual
claim
to
be
the
plaintiff
in
front
of
the
court.
and
that's...
and,
again,
just
to
be
clear,
we
are
still
here
dealing
with
the
hypothetical.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
core
question
of
what
do
you
do
with
a
plaintiff
who
has
not
one
penny
at
stake
in
litigation
that,
as
the
lawyers
describe,
is
all
hard
cash.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
when
you...
when
you
deal
with
mass
tort
litigation,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
ought
to
apply
in
that
context
as
it
applies
in
every
other
place.
and
when
the
courts
deviate
from
the
standard
paradigm
for
litigation,
they
do
it
expressly,
either
through
the
rules
or
through
doctrines
that
already
exist.
and
so
we
have
rule
23,
which
sets
out
very
clear
protections
for
both
the
courts...
or
not
only
for
the
courts,
but
for
the
plaintiffs
and
for
the
absent
defendants...
absent,
absent
plaintiffs
and
for
the
defendants,
and
is
a
clear
mechanism
for
conducting
1400
claims
all
once
in
a
particular
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
goes
directly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
to
be
sure.
again,
i
don't
think
that...
i
mean,
the
article
iii
debate
here
seems
to
me
to
turn
solely
on
the
question
of
there
is
no
stake
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
that's
a
bedrock
requirement
of
article
iii
and
ought
to
be
a
basis
for
simply
reversing.
but,
you
know,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
then
goes
beyond
that
and
worries
about
what's
the
next
case
going
to
look
like
and
what
are
the
prudential
limitations,
which
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
resolve
any
of
this,
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
court
should
be
informed
by
rule
23
and
associational
standing
and
those
doctrines--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that's
the
right
answer,
is
that
the
court
shouldn't
just
make
it
up
as
it
goes
along.
and
if
there
is
a
need
for
this...
look,
and
the
truth
is
we've
been
here
200
years.
we
haven't
had
to
have
aggregator
standing
all
of
this
time.
it
strikes
me
that
there's
no
compelling
need
for
a
change
and
that
for
that
reason
the
court
ought
to
go
back
to
the
paradigm
example,
plaintiffs
sue
defendants
and
you
have
normal
discovery
and
counterclaims.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that...
i
mean
the
proceeds...
i
assume...
do
those
claims
arise
out
of
the
relationship
between
the
payphone
operators
and
the
aggregator?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
completely
unrelated
to
that?
it's
just
a
garnishment
on
it?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
assume
those
moneys
could
be
taken
out
of
the
aggregator
and
then
the
psp
would
have
a
claim
over
against
the
aggregator
for
breach
of
contract.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
specific
protection
is
that
the
courts
determine
how
the
settlements
will
play
out.
they
make
sure
that
all
of
the
requirements
of
rule
23
are
satisfied
before
the
litigation
goes
forward.
that
means
that
there
is
a
demonstration
of
commonality,
that
there...
the
predominance
issue
is
resolved,
that
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
litigated
in
this
forum
because
it
is
a
more
efficient
mechanism
for
litigating
it,
not
because
the
assignor...
assignee
decided
that
this
is
more
efficient
way
from
the
assignee's
perspective--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
litigate
the
issue.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
of
course,
because
you
don't
want
to
have
all
this
litigation
being
heaped
on
a
particular
defendant
under
these
circumstances.
there
is
an
efficiency
to
this
process
that
the
rules
anticipate.
and
i
think
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
simply
no
reason
in
the
world
to
say
we're
going
to
allow
this
to
be
as
a
substitute
for
existing
doctrines
under
either
rule
23--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--or
associational
standing.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure,
and
my
answer
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
we
would
oppose
it.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
proper
case
for
class
certification.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
mean
okay,
and,
therefore,
the
answer
to
this
is:
come
up
with
some
other
contrivance
in
order
to
litigate
this
in
a
way
that
obviously
maximizes
the
convenience
to
one
side
without
regard
to
the
protections
that
are
designed
both
for
the
defendant
and
for
the
court
that's
embodied
in
rule
23.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it's
interesting
because
they...
in
one...
in
the
assignment
part
of
it
they
say
they
are
bound,
but
on
the...
on
the
separate
set
of
the
agreement
it
talks
about
the
reasonable
discretion
of
the
assignor...
assignee.
so
the
agreement
is,
to
my
mind,
inherently
contradictory
as
to
what
are
the
obligations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
it's
reasonable...
it
says
reasonable
discretion.
and
so
the
question
is,
you
know,
is
this...
was
that
an
exercise
of
reasonable
discretion?
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
in
any
given
case.
and
i
think
part
of
the...
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer,
you
asked
the
question
about
above
and
beyond
discovery,
what
are
the
other
problems
that
arise
when
you
go
down
this...
and
the
more...
the
other
one
is
that
being
bound
by
the
judgment.
if
you
have
a
complete
assignment
of
the
chosen
action,
the
assignee,
then,
is
completely
bound.
there
is
nothing
left.
the
assignor
has
no
rights
left.
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
assignor
to
do
in
that
situation;
whereas,
in
these
kinds
of
situations
where
the
assignee
receives
the
right
to
go
forward
but
the
remedy
is
in
another
party's
hands,
the
potential
for
being
bound
is
completely
lost.
