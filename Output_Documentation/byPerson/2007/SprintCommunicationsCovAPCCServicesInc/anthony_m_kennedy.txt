justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can
make
that
same
answer
if
it's
just
a
standard
assignee
for
collection
of...
of
a
debt
for
single
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
it's
a
full
assignment,
where
everybody
agrees
that
there's
standing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
make
the
same
argument:
oh,
he
might
not
have
all
the
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
like
you
to
go
back
to
the
question
that
justice
stevens,
justice
breyer,
and
i
asked
you.
you
said,
oh,
there's
a
problem,
there's
no
counterclaim,
we
can't
get
the
information.
and
we
say,
well,
that
happens
in
every
accounts
receivable
assignment;
there's
no
problem
there.
and
then
you
say,
well,
that
should
be
in
state
court.
that's
not
right.
i
thought
it
was
agreed,
stipulated
by
you
at
the
outset,
that
if
there's
a
standard
assignment
for
collection
you
can
be
in
the
federal
court;
there
is
standing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
article
iii.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you're
saying,
if
you're
saying
that
it's
the
aggregation
that
makes
it
difficult
to
reach
everybody,
well,
that's
a
question
of
discovery,
and
it's
still
the
aggregator's
responsibility.
if
the
aggregator
can't
answer
necessary
questions
for
discovery
of
the
suit,
the
suit's
dismissed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
like
to
be
the
broken
record.
i'm
just
not
getting...
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
the
responsibility
of
the
plaintiff.
the
district
court
said,
now,
you've
brought
these
claims.
the
defendants
need
this
information.
you
go
get
that.
that's
your
responsibility.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
is
this
1,400
causes
of
action
or
is
it
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
come
about?
suppose
a
lot
of
people
owe
the
bank...
a
lot
of
farmers
owe
the
bank
money,
can
there
be
assignment
in
this
one
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
does
the
law
express
the
metaphysical
process
in
which
1,400
causes
of
action
become
one
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
not
a
representative
cause
of
action.
what
is
the
magic
point
at
which
it
becomes
one
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
still
missing
something
here.
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
where
this
has
happened
in
other
cases
that
this
court
has
heard
that
are
commonly
heard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
interrupted
you
and
i
talked
over
you.
every
rule
23
cause
of
action
and
what
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
associational
standing,
sierra
club
v.
morton,
they
are
interested
in
an
ongoing
injury
in
which
there
is
a
common...
in
which
there
is
a
common
injury.
these
are
liquidated
amounts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
usually
ongoing
injuries
as
to
which
there's
a
common
interest
in
stopping
the
injury.
here
you're
aggregating
liquidated
amounts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
might
understand
it
if
was
some
sort
of
injunction
actions...
in
the
future
please
pay
what
you're
supposed
to
pay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
allowed
because
the
requisites
for
class
actions
have
been
met
and
that's
authorized
by
the
rule.
that's
not
true
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
a
lot
of
better
procedures
that
are
in
the
rules
but
it
is
not
in
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
this
could
not
have
been
brought
as
a
class
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
didn't
you
bring
it
as
a
class
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
why
didn't
you
bring
it
as
a
class
action?
we
can
all
go
home.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
do
we
have
rule
23
that
requires
certification
of
a
class
action?
if
you
can
say,
well,
i
don't
need
rule
23,
i'm
going
to
take
1400
claims
and
make
them
one
any
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
are
problems--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
the
requirements
of
typicality
and...
the
same
type
of
injury
designed
in
part
to
preserve
the
rights
of
the
defendant?
