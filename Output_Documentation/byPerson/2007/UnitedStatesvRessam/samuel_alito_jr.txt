could
you
give
an
example
of
where
it's
not
temporal,
an
example
of
use
of
"during"
that
is
not
temporal?
justice

alito,

but
hanging
up
lights
"during"
the...
the
holiday
season
doesn't...
that's
not
a
temporal
relationship?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
there's
an
"in
relationship"
requirement,
why
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
explosives
to
facilitate
the
false
statement?
why
wouldn't
it
be
sufficient
if
the
false
statement
facilitated
the
unlawful
use
of
the
explosives?
