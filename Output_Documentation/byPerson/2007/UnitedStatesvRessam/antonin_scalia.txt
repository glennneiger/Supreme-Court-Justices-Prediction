justice

general,
could...
could
congress
pass
a
law
that
said
if
you
wear
a
wristwatch
during
the
commission
of
any
crime,
you
get
another
ten
years?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
it
depends
on
what
the
felony
is.
if
the
felony
is
the
filing
of
a
dishonest
tax
return
and...
and
you
have
a
can
of
gasoline
with
you
when
you
mail
the
letter,
it
seems
to
me
quite
as
absurd
as
saying
wearing
a
wristwatch
in
the
course
of
a
felony.
that's
what
troubles
me
about
this.
i'm...
i'm
tempted
to...
i
think
everybody
is
tempted
to
distort
the
"during"
to...
to
mean
something
else,
simply
because
the
consequences
of
performing
a
completely
lawful
act
wearing
a
wristwatch,
carrying
explosives...
given
the
broad
definition
of
explosives,
i
guess
it
would
include
having...
having
some
cartridges,
explosive
cartridges?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
perfectly
lawful,
and
you
get
another
10
years
for
it
just
because
you're...
you're
mailing
a
letter
to
the
irs
at
the
same
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
a
very
good
case.
if
you
wanted
to
bring
a
really
absurd
case,
you
could
have
picked
a
better
one
than
this,
because
there
really
is
something
of
a
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
should
have
said
"during
which"?
justice
antonin
scalia
"during
the
commission
of
which
the
explosive
was
used
or
carried?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
policeman
who
had
cartridges
in
his
gun,
presumably,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
it
is
not
a
question
on
which
we
grant
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
got
it
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
about
the
"in
which",
the
"in
which"
thing?
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
"in
which"
is
in
a
very
sloppy
clause
anyway,
because
it
says
"shall
run
concurrently
with
any
other
term
of
imprisonment,
including
that
imposed
for
the
felony
in
which
the
explosive
was
used
or
carried.
"
what
about
the
fire?
it
omits
fire
entirely...
in
which
fire
or
the
explosive.
fire
or
the
explosive
was
used
or
the
explosive
was
carried.
it's
a
pretty
sloppy
job
down
at
the
end
of
(h),
isn't
it?
so
i
wouldn't
put
a
whole
lot
of
weight
on
the
"in
which"
given
that
the
rest
of
it
is
so
sloppy.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
being
very
precise,
but
whoever
wrote
that
was,
obviously,
not
being
very
precise
because
he
left
out
"fire"
entirely.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
maybe
gunpowder
doesn't
include
the
little
bit
that's
in
a
cartridge
either.
you
think
it
does?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
going
to
be...
it
was
going
to
be
inaccurate
as
to
one
or
the
other
of
one
or
two.
if
you
said
"during",
that
would
be...
that
would
be
inaccurate
as
to
one.
and
"in"
is
accurate
as
to
one
but
inaccurate
as
to
two.
i
guess
they
should
have
said
"in
or
during"
or
"in
which".
they
should
have
added
"fire",
too,
right?
[laughter]
