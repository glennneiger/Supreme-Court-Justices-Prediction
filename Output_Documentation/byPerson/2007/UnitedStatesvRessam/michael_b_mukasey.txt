mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
when
it
added
the
words
844
of
title
18,
and
we
think
for
at
least
four
reasons,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
first,
and
principally,
those
words
are
not
in
the
statute
that
congress
wrote,
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
courts
should
not
add
words
or
elements
to
criminal
statutes.
second,
congress
knows
how
to
include
a
relational
element
when
it
wants
to,
and
in
fact,
did
that
in
section
924(c)
after
which
section
844
is
otherwise
patterned.
and
that
shows
that
when
congress
chose
to
leave
844
it
did
that
intentionally.
third,
when
section
844
was
amended
in
1988,
one
court
of
appeals,
the
only
court
of
appeals
to
rule
directly
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
relationship
between
the
carrying
of
explosives
in
the
commission
of
a
felony,
had
held
that
there
was
no
relational
element.
congress
was
on
notice
of
that
fact--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--correct.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
in
that
instance,
that
would
be
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
when
congress
in...
in
924(c)
said
"during
and
in
relation
to",
it
meant
something
more
than
a
temporal
relationship.
it
did
not
say
the
same
thing
in
844,
and
it
failed
to
say
the
same
thing
in
844(f)
or
the
amended
924(c).
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
a
statute
like
that
would
be
entirely
unreasonable.
it
was
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
said
if
you
carry
an
explosive
during
the
commission
of
a
felony,
you've
added
something
enormously
volatile.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
it
would.
but
the
temptation--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--it
is
perfectly
lawful.
congress
was
aware
that
title
18,
not
to
mention
all
the
other
titles,
are
chockablock
with
felonies.
there
are
thousands
of
them
out
there.
but
nonetheless,
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
mainstream
that
it
was
concerned
with,
which
is
nicely
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
were
taken
care
of;
and
so
it
passed
a
very
broad
statute.
we
concede
that
it
was
a
very
broad
statute.
"any
felony"
couldn't
be
broader.
but
that
was
congress's
choice.
and
if
congress
chooses
to
amend
the
statute,
respectfully,
it
ought
to
be
congress
that
amends
it.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
there
is.
at
the
time
the
case
was
brought,
there
was
evidence
to
charge
the
first
count,
conspiracy
to
commit
a
terrorist
act.
there
were
some
evidentiary
problems;
a
great
deal
of
the
evidence
to
support
that
count
did
not,
in
fact,
come
until
almost
literally
the
eve
of
trial.
a
lot
of
it
came
from
overseas.
the
count
to
which
the...
the
844...
the
crime
to
which
844
was,
in
fact,
attached,
the
making
of
a
false
statement,
was,
to
use
a
colloquialism,
a
lead-pipe
cinch.
he
had
clearly
made
a
false
statement.
he
had
clearly
carried
an
explosive
while
doing
it.
that
prosecutor's
decision,
in
fact,
was
a
very
responsible
one,
because
what
was
shown
when
they
opened
his
trunk
was
that
this
was
a
very
dangerous
person;
and
they
wanted
to
bring
a
charge
on
which
they
were
sure
to
convict
him,
so
that
his
carrying
of
the
explosive
would
get
him
ten
years
in
addition
to
that
charge.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
the
safeguard...
the
safeguard
that
is
in
the
system,
in
part,
involves
the
history
of
the
system.
rosenberg
was
decided,
i
believe,
in
1986.
that's
22
years
ago.
there's
been
no,
as
far
as
i
know,
recorded
outbreak
of
this
sort
of
thing
any
place,
in
the
third
circuit
or
any
place
else.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
defendant
would
be
able
to
challenge
that
kind
of
threat,
that
kind
of
application,
or
at
least
make
it
known.
we
haven't
received
any
notification
that
that's...
that
that's
going
on,
although
there
have
been
charges
of...
under
844(h),
relating
to
ammunition.
but
that's
scarcely...
that's
scarcely
a
marginal
case.
the
hypothetical
of
the
fellow
with
the...
with
the
firecracker
in
his
back
pocket
who
is
simultaneously
in
possession
of
a
$20
counterfeit
bill
has
no--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--we
don't,
but,
respectfully,
"relationship"
doesn't
mean
in
a
statute
what
"relationship"
means
in
conversation.
it
means
facilitation
under
a
knife.
it
means
that--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--it
was...
his
carrying
of
explosives
did
not
facilitate
his
lying
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
maybe
it
caused
it,
and
maybe
it
didn't.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not.
because
there
are
cases
in
which
it
may
become
necessary
to
prosecute
somebody...
for
example,
where
we
have
a
situation
in
which
we
can
charge
another
crime,
but
the
charge
of
that
crime
would
involve
disclosure
of
classified
information;
it
would
disclose
methods
and
sources...
we
believe
that
it
was
congress's
choice
to
leave
to
the
judgment
of
prosecutors
the
decision
of
what
crimes
the
charge
in
conjunction
with
possession
of
explosives,
and
we
think
that's
where
the
authority
should
remain.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
possession
of
explosives
inherently
involves
volatility.
you
asked
for
a
policy
explanation.
possession
of
explosives
inherently
involves
a
degree
of
volatility.
explosives
cause
indiscriminate
and
potentially
vast
harm.
firearms,
for
all
the
harm
they
cause,
cause
discriminate
harm.
and
there's
every
reason
for
congress
to
have
treated
explosives
differently
from
the
way
it
treated
firearms.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
think
the
history
of
the
amendments
to
924(c)
reflects
that.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg;
and
that
underlines,
i
think,
the
dangerousness,
or
congress's
perception
of
the
dangerousness,
and
the
volatility
of
explosives.
and
certainly--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--this
case
bears
that
out.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
there
is
no
policy
limitation
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
we
do.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
think
i'd
be
ideally
suited
to
do
that.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
the
ten
years
is
mandatory.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
that's
an
additional
ten
years,
no
matter
what.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
he
still
gets
ten
years.
it
is
possible,
again,
to
imagine
many,
many
marginal
situations;
but
i
think
congress
was
willing
to
contemplate
that
because
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
swept
in
the
cases
that
had
to
be
swept
in.
and
to
add
a
relational
element
would
leave
us
unprotected
against
the
cases
that
congress
wanted
to
include,
and
protected
only
against
the
marginal
ones.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
how
many
cases
as
a
matter
of
common
sense?
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
no
historical
record
that
i'm
familiar
with,
but
i
don't
have
complete
knowledge
of
the
historical
record.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
don't
think...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
situation
in
which
it
has
arisen.
but
i
don't...
i
think
congress
didn't
wanted
to
rule
out
anything
when
it
wrote
"any
felony".
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
think...
i
think
the
lessons
we
learned,
particularly
about
the
history,
is
that
we
don't
want
to
bring
absurd
cases,
and...
and
we
don't.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
that--
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
--that
has
to
do
more
with
the
breadth
of
the
definition
of
"explosives"
than
it
has
to
do
with
the
question
of
a
relationship,
because
we
may
very
well
be
concerned
with
the
person
who
is
committing
what
sounds
like
an
innocuous
felony
but
carrying
a
load
of
explosives
in
his
trunk.
so
weaving
in
a
relational
requirement
isn't
going
to
solve
the
problem
that's
posed
in
what
i
think
is
your
honor's
hypothetical,
which
is
the
fact
that
firecrackers
are
as
much
explosives
as
bombs
under
the
"explosives"
definition
contained
in
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
just
wanted
to
make
two
brief
points
on
rebuttal.
first,
justice
breyer's
question
and
position
appears
to
read
in
a
relational
element
that's
also
not
in
this
statute.
and
our
view
is
that
that
is
something
that
should
be
done,
if
anybody,
by
congress.
and
secondly,
that
the
respondent's
reference
to
gasoline
as
an
explosive
i
think
is
a
bit
of...
is
a
bit
of
a
reach.
i
don't
think
gasoline
is
generally
regarded
as
an
explosive
unless
it
is
prepared
and
processed
and
presented
in
a
certain
way
with...
in
ways
that
are
not
present
simply
by
carrying
a
can
of
gasoline
to
help
a...
to
help
out
a
friend
who's
run
out
of
gas.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
i
think
it
does.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
the
"in
which"
simply
includes
both,
number
one,
the
use...
the
actual
use
and,
number
two,
the
carrying.
i
agree
that
it's
not
a
model
of
elegant
construction,
but
"in
which"
does
include
the
two,
both
the
actual
use
and
the
mere
carrying.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
no,
i
think
it
suggests
simply
that
the
underlying
felony
was,
in
fact,
committed.
mr.
michael
b.
mukasey
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
