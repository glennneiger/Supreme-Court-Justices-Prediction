justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
what's
troubling
me,
mr.
attorney
general,
is
that
it...
it
does
seem
to
me
fair
enough
to
make
that
charge
in
this
case;
but
then
we...
but
then
we
have
the
tremendous
number
of
cases
where
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
be
in
the
position
in
a
plea-bargain
context,
say,
to
threaten
to
charge
this
offense
with
a
heavy
mandatory
minimum.
my
understanding
is
that
district
judges
do
not
and
cannot
be
involved
in
plea
bargain
negotiations;
they
can
look
at
a
plea
before
it
is
entered.
what
can
you
tell
us
about
the
safeguards
that
might
exist
in
the
system
generally
against...
against
overcharging,
against
charging
for
something
where
the
result
is
close
to
absurd,
as
in
some
of
these
hypotheticals
about
the
income
tax
return
and
the
gasoline
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
if
you
thought
there
was
a
problem,
you
could
promulgate
them
out
of
your
department.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
one
of
the
reasons
you
make
your
argument
is
so
that
if
you
prevail
and
you
go
back
to
trial,
you
would
argue
that
this
is
not
in
relation
to?
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
and
we
say
"in
relation
to"
is
part
of
the
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
you
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
i
assume
you
will
argue
to
the
jury
that
the
government
can't
show
that
it's
in
relation
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
prosecution,
in
this
prosecution,
it
might
be
somewhat
difficult
to
establish
in
relation
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
would
be...
even
assuming
the
jury
was
properly
instructed,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
but
doesn't
that
show
the
necessity
for
the
very
interpretation
the
attorney
general
has
argued
for
here?
it
is
just
too
difficult
to
establish
and
very
dangerous?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
on
this
evidence,
on
this
record,
that
a
jury,
if
it
were
instructed
to...
that
it
had
to
find
"in
relation
to"
could
return
a
conviction
of
guilty
including
the
"in
relation
to"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
this
case
had
been
instructed
according
to
your
theory
of
the
statute
and
on
this
record
and
on
this
evidence,
could
a
jury
find
your
client
guilty?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
exactly
why
the
attorney
general
says
he
needs
it.
