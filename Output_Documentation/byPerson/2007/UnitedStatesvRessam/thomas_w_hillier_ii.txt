mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
general
mukasey
put
his
finger
on
the
point
here
when
he
said
we
wanted
to
charge
a
lead-pipe
cinch
case.
but
in
doing
so,
what
we
now
have
is
what
was
a
terrorism
prosecution
and
a
choice
to
link
the
underlying
felony...
or
to
link
the
carrying
explosives
charges
exclusively
to
count
5
of
the
indictment,
which
charged
a
false
statement,
an
argument
which
requests
that
this
court
apply
this
statute
to
all
sorts
of
situations
theoretically
that
might
even
involve
explosives
that
were
lawfully
carried
during
a
completely
unrelated
felony.
and
i
would
disagree
that
that's
what
congress
thought,
that's
what
congress
thought
when
it
was
creating
this
statute.
the
words...
in
applying
this
court's
statutory
construction
regime,
what
we
do
first
of
all,
of
course,
is
look
to
the
words
of
the
text
to
see
if
it
means
what
the
government
suggests
it
does
in
this
case.
and
as,
chief
justice
roberts,
you
have
already
indicated,
the
word
"during"
has
meanings
beyond
just
the
temporal
one
used
here.
but
also
other
words
in
the
text
have
significance
to
describing
what
the
meaning
of
this
particular
statute
is,
and
important
among
those
are
the
terms
"in
which",
which
is
found
in
the
concluding
sentence
of
the
statute.
and,
of
course,
that's...
the
companion
word,
the
largest
word
in
this
particular
statute,
844(j).
taking
first
the
term
844(h)...
and
i'll
quote.
and
what
it
says
is
that
the
penalty
that's
going
to
attach
to
this
prosecution
shall
run
consecutively
to,
quote,
"the
felony
in
which
the
explosive
was
used
or
carried.
"
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
just
think
that
the
words...
the
words
that
were
used,
your
honor,
establish
the
notion
of
a
relationship
between
the
felony
and
the
explosive.
the
word
v.
commodity
futures
trading
commission,
519
u.s.
465,
is
synonymous
with
the
words
"in
regard
to"
or
"with
respect
to".
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
that's
very
true.
and
it
fact,
it
has
a,
quote,
"locational"
sort
of
significance
also.
but
as
noted
in
dunn,
its
primary
definition,
its
first
definition,
is
this
relational
one.
and,
while
it
might
have--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--it's
temporal.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
think
the
example
posed
by
the
chief
justice
to
general
mukasey
is
an
example
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
it's
a...
it
is
a
temporal
relationship,
but
it's
a
relationship
between
the
act
that's
occurring
also,
that's
the
underlying
act.
but
to
get
to
the
point
of
the...
chief
justice
robert's
question,
the
fact
that
the
word
may
have
more
than
one
meaning,
particularly
in
this
case,
does
not
exclude
the
fact
that
the
meaning
of
"in
which"
includes
a
relationship.
and
the
most
naturally
suggested
reading
of
these
words
in
this
case,
"in
which"
and
"explosives"
together,
is
that
there
is
a
relationship,
but
there
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--yes,
your
honor.
two
points:
first,
the
idea...
the
idea
of
in
pari
materia,
which
would
suggest
that
what's
happening
in
924(c)
ought
to
be
occurring
in
844
is...
has
not
the
force
that
it
would
if
we
were
talking
about
amendments
to
and
constructions
of
the
same
statute,
but
rather
what
we
have
here
are
two
statutes
that
are
being
interpreted
by
two
legislators
at
different
times
to
achieve
different
objects.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the...
well,
the
force
of
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--right.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
i
think
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the...
when
you're
looking
at
what
happened
to
844,
when
"unlawfully"
was
taken
out
the
words
"in
which"
were
added,
which
i
think
indicates
that
congress
had
an
appreciation
of
the
relationship
that's
involved
in
that
statute.
while
the
legislative
history
doesn't
say
why
"unlawfully"
was
taken
out,
it
seems
reasonable
to
believe
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
conform
the
statute
to
the
purpose
of...
its
purpose.
and
its
purpose
did
include,
when
you
look
at
the
"explosives"
definition,
the
use
of
lawful
explosives
to
further
crimes.
so
if
somebody
has
a
can
of
gasoline
and
they
want
to
use
that
to
threaten
somebody
and
create
a
federal
crime
or
to
accomplish
a
federal
crime,
before
that
amendment
occurred
that...
that
would
have
been
a
lawful
possession
of
the
explosives,
so
844(h)(2)
would
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
the...
i
think
we
go
to
yet
another
statutory
construction
tool,
or
at
least
observation
by
this
court
that
said
the
congress
can
use
different
words
in
different
statutes
to
accomplish
the
same
thing.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
know
it
didn't
do
that
because
the
legislative
history
doesn't
inform
us.
but
to
draw
an
analogy
from
your
question
with
respect
to
changes
done
in
these
two
exact
statutes,
as
you
read
from
the
government's
reply
brief,
it
is
trying
to
establish
through
the
words
"during
the
commission
of"
the
fact
that
it
is
the
defendant
that
committed
that
crime,
in
other
words
it
was
he
that
did
so.
and
we
don't
take
any
issue
with
that;
in
fact,
it
makes
complete
sense.
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
924(c)
in
1971
was
amended
to
put
these...
to
substitute
the
words
"for
which
he
may
be
prosecuted.
"
instead
of
"which
may
be
prosecuted".
so
one
might
ask
why
didn't
they
put
the
word
844
at
the
same
time
if
there
was
any
question
about
who
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
was.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
touche,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
if
you
could
rephrase
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
your
honor,
if
you
agree
that
there's
a...
if
you
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
then
the
case
is
over.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
the
government--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--it
would
be
difficult--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--right.
right.
it's
as
poison
here.
they
don't
have
a
relationship.
the
explosives
were
not
used
to--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--your
honor,
if
we
can
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
what
was
done
here
was
a
charging
decision
which
made
that
task
impossible.
the
government
could
have
simply
charged
this
count
with
count
1,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
surely
the
explosives
were
carried
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
the
act
of
terrorism
that
was
charged
count
1.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
we
have
a
reverse
sort
of
relationship.
your
honor,
two
answers
to
that:
first,
it
would
be
at
odds
with
the
structure
of
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
whole
of
844(h),
you
see
in
(h)(1),
the
crime
of
using
an
explosive
to...
an
explosive
to
commit
an
underlying
felony.
and
that
is
that
sort
of
direct
relationship
that
is
carried
forward
in
the
language
of
(h)(2).
but,
secondly,
that
language...
that
sort
of
relationship
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
smith
as
acknowledged
by
the
government
in
its
briefing
to
mean
the
relationship
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
your
honor,
i
can't
say
too
much
more
than
what
i
have.
when
you
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
that's...--
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--well,
your
honor,
the
relationship...
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
surely
(h)(1)
does
not
describe
that
sort
of
relationship;
(h)(2)
is
the
next
statute
or
the
next
subsection
of
that
statute,
and
its
purpose
is
simply
to
capture
the
same
criminal
objective
here,
that
is
to
say,
the
marriage
of
explosives
and
a
felony.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
i
would
ask
the
court...
well,
i
would
think
the
court
would
draw
some...
an
answer
from
smith
which
did
describe
a
relationship
contrary
to
the
way
your
honor
is
doing
with
respect
to
this
case
that
goes
back
to...
goes...
wasn't
instructed
that
way;
and
so
it
can't
be...
this
case
still
has
to
go
back.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
if
this
case
had
been
instructed
correctly?
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
your
honor,
the
"in
which"...
the
point
obviously
was
that
it
strengthens
and
informs
the
relationship
here
to
be
more
than
the
coincidental
or
temporal
one
the
government--
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
--i
suppose
that
goes
to
the
idea
that
we
shouldn't
draw
a
lot
of
information
from
the
amendments
that
were
occurring
on
924
when
they
weren't
even
looking
at
this
statute
and
considering
it
and
its
consequences
to
the
changes
in
844...
or
having
effect
in
844.
your
honor,
i
would
just
simply
conclude
by
indicating
that
the
terms,
which
i
think
we
agree,
naturally
suggest
that
there
must
be
a
relationship,
and
the
breadth
of
the
term
844's
effect
and
its
purpose,
because
when
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
the
way
that
they
constructed
it
so
carefully
and
thoughtfully
in
terms
of
the
crimes
that
were...
or
the...
the
use
of
explosives,
it
applies
only
to
that
portion
of
the
statute
that
involves
illegal
use
of
criminal...
of
explosives.
and
the
combination
of
all
of
these
elements
certainly
gives
force
to
our
argument
and
tends
to
rub...
tends
to
do
the
opposite
to
the
government.
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
there's
anything
to
be
said
for
the
government's
argument,
then
there
is
an
ambiguity,
and
it
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
and
i...
just
a
concluding
point
to
answer
justice
kennedy's
questions,
the
government
could
have
avoided
all
of
this
by
simply
charging
this
case,
as
it
should
have,
by
linking
count
9
with
count
1,
where
the
proof
problem
wouldn't
have
been
a...
the
only
difference
in
the
proof
would
have
been...
there
would
have
been
no
difference
in
the
proof.
the
only
difference
in
the
case
would
have
been
they
would
have
submitted
a
different
instruction.
mr.
thomas
w.
hillier,
ii
well,
your
honor...
no,
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
and
i'm
not
sure
why
that
is.
but
i
think
it's
been
alluded
to
by
the
court
already
in
its
questioning.
it
could
be
that
prosecutors
simply
recognized
this
to
be
a
good
plea
bargaining
chip
and
maybe
the
other
prosecutors
understand
that
there's
a
relationship
required.
