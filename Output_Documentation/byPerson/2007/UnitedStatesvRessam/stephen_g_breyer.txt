justice
stephen
g.
breyer
general,
that
is...
my
question
would
be
the
converse.
suppose
i
agreed
with
you
to
this
point
hypothetically
that,
of
course,
there's
a
relationship
here.
in
this
case,
there's
a
relationship.
he
wouldn't
have
lied
if
he...
if
he
hadn't
had
the
explosives.
suppose
i
accept
that.
now,
if
i
interpret
the
statute
that
way...
there
has
to
be
a
relationship,
but
including
that...
then
what
are
the
other
cases
you
want
to
prosecute?
in
the
other
briefs
they
list
every
funny
or
comical
or
absurd
example
they
can
find;
and
so
i
don't
believe
you
want
to
prosecute
those,
but
tell
me
if
you
do.
and
if
there
are
some
other
ones,
what
are
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
suppose,
in
other
words,
if
we...
if,
hypothetically,
i
were
to
say,
well,
here
there's
a
relationship;
after
all,
it
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
lying
that
he
was
carrying
explosives;
and
it
is
foreseeable
that
he
would
lie
on
his
passport,
because
he
was
carrying
explosives
illegally.
so
that's
all
you
need.
in
other
words,
if
that
were
the
decision,
you
would
say
fine,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
didn't
facilitate
it,
but
it
caused
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
didn't...
all
right.
would
you
be
satisfied
with
a
result
that
says,
look,
if
this
carrying
of
explosives
is
related
to
the
felony
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
necessary
condition
and
foreseeable
that
a
person
would
do
such
a
thing,
that's
sufficient?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
should
we
agree
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
what's
bothering
me.
the
issue
in
this
case
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
these
weird
hypotheticals.
of
course
it
requires
a
relationship,
in
my
mind.
but
i
don't
see
why
the
relationship
couldn't
be
exactly
the
one
justice
alito
was
talking
about.
i
mean,
imagine
a
person
has
a
packed
car
filled
with
explosives.
he's
going
to
blow
something
up.
a
policemen
comes
up;
he
shoots
the
policeman.
the
reason
he
shot
the
policeman
was
because
he
had
his
car
packed
with
explosives.
and
if
this...
if
this
provision...
i
mean,
i
can't
understand
why
this
provision
wouldn't
be
aimed
directly
at
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
i
don't
agree
with
you
about
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
may
be,
but
i
don't
know...
but
you
could
say
that.
you
could
say
that.
but
the
problem
is
i
have
to
answer
the
question...
i
have
to
reach
an
answer
that
i
believe
should
be
sensible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
should
i
do--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
i
think
that
shooting
the
policeman
because
he's
going
to
catch
the
criminal
filled
with
explosives
is
within
this
statute?
and
similarly,
lying
to
a
customs
officer
so
he
won't
catch
me
when
my
car
is
filled
with
explosives
is
within
the
statute?
suppose
i
believe
that,
but
i
also
think
the
statute
is
not
meant
to
govern
those
odd
hypotheticals
that
you
come
up
with?
there
has
to
be
a
relationship,
but
the
one
i
described
falls
within
the
word
"relationship".
now
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that
argument.
but
suppose
i
don't
accept
the
argument?
then
what
do
i
do
in
this
case?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
