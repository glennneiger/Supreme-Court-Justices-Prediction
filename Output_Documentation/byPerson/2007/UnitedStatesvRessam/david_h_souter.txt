was...
was
the
further
explanation
that
what
they
were
doing
in
amending
the
firearms
statute
was
tailoring
it
more
precisely
to
the
possible
felony
by
a
police
officer
situation,
and
they
simply
did
not
face
that
possibility
in
the
explosives
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.

mr.
hillier,
i...
you
know,
i
will
accept
maybe
more
than
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
if
you
stick
to
the
text
alone
you've
got
an
argument
here
for
some
uncertainty,
for
some
ambiguity.
the
trouble
that
i
have
with
your
argument
is
that
we're
here
to
consider
not
only
text
but
statutory
history,
and
the
statutory
history
seems
to
me
pretty
tough
for
you
to
get
over.
the
statute
was
amended.
the
word
"unlawfully"
was
dropped
from
it,
and
there
was
no
amendment
made,
with
respect
to
its
cognates,
to
conform
it
to
the
cognate
section
on
carrying
a
gun
that
specified
"in
relation
to".
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
reasonable
inference
to
draw
from
that
statutory
history
is
that
when
congress
amended
and
technically
re-enacted
the
statute,
when
it
dropped
"unlawfully",
that
it
did
not
want
"during"
to
be
read,
as
it
was
in
the
handgun
statute,
"in
relation
to".
and
i...
that's
seems
to
me
the
tough
point
of
the
argument.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
different
object...
i
mean,
the
trouble
with
the
different
object
argument
is,
as
the
attorney
general
said,
there
was
an
evident
concern
in
amending
the
handgun
statute
not
to
sweep
in
the
rogue
police
officer
who
happens
to
have
a
gun
on
him
when
he
does
something
that
in
fact
is
unlawful.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
negative
inference
from
that
is
that
there
was
an
intent
in
the
cognate
explosives
statute
to
sweep
in
people,
whether
in
fact
it
was
in
relation
to
or
not
in
relation
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
fair
enough
so
far
as
the
argument
goes.
but
that
still
leaves
congress
taking
the...
sort
of
making
it
as
difficult
as
possible
for
you
to
take
the
position
that
you're
taking,
rather
than
as
easy
as
possible.
why
didn't
it
put
in
"in
relation
to"?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
can
do
it,
but
why
would
it
have
done
so?
you've
the...
you've
got
the
gun
example
sitting
there.
and
why
would
it
not
have
done
so
if,
in
fact...
so
obvious
a
thing
to
do
if
that's
what...
if
it
intended
to
come
out
your
way?
