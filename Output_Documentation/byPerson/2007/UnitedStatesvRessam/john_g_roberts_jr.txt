chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
07-455,
united
states
versus
ressam.
general
mukasey.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
relies
on
the
notion
that
the
word
"during"
in
the
statute
is
solely
temporal.
in
other
words,
it
just
refers
to
the
time?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
that's
not
always
the
case.
if
i
say,
you
know,
i
hung
lights
during
the
holiday
season,
you
wouldn't
think
that
i
hung
a
chandelier,
right?
there'd
be
not
simply
a
temporal
connection,
but
also
a
relation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
there
in
the
statutes
a
difference
between
possession
of
explosives
in
this
circumstance
and
possession
of
firearms?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
any--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
there
any
policy
limitation
within
the
department
not
to
charge
under
this
provision
unless
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
underlying
felony
and
the
use
of...
the
carrying
of
explosives?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
ten
years,
though,
is
mandatory,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
a
prosecutor
asks
for
it
and
there
is
an
underlying
felony
and
there
is
an
explosive,
that's
an
additional
ten
years,
no
matter
what.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
get...
the
underlying
felony
is
of
the
sort
justice
scalia
was
talking
about,
and
let's
say
the
person
gets
probation
on
that
because,
you
know,
it
is
the
first
offense,
no
harm,
he
still
gets
ten
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
how
many
cases
are
there
likely
to
be...
this
isn't
one
of
them...
where
you
have
no
"in
relation
to"
connection
whatsoever?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
any
historical
record
that
you're
familiar
with.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
in
this
case,
as
you
point
out,
there
was,
of
course,
a
connection.
and
i
would
have
thought
in
most
cases
where
the
prosecutor
is
interested
in
charging...
because,
as
you
have
indicated,
this
case
is...
there
would
be
an
actual
connection.
now,
you
may
have,
as
you
suggest,
problems
with
proof
or...
or
evidence;
but,
as
a
practical
matter,
i'm
just
wondering
how
often
the
question
we're
concerned
about
arises.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
mean
the
interesting
thing
is
that
you're...
the
cases
where
this
is
going
to
arise
is
not
where
you're
really
worried
about
the
explosives;
it's
going
to...
because
in
that
case,
presumably
there
is
going
to
be
a
relation,
and
you
can
use
it
as
you
used
it
in
this
case.
the
cases
where
this
is
going
to
be
problematic
is
when
you
are
really
interested
in
the
underlying
felony.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
the
guy
who's
driving
in
his
car
and
calls
his
broker
and
is
guilty
of
insider
trading
and
has
some
firecrackers
in
the
trunk,
you're
not
worried
about
the
firecrackers,
but
you
want
to
crack
down
on
the
insider
trading.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
hillier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
just...
just
as
"during"
has
more
than
temporal...
can
have
more
than
temporal
significance,
i
think
"in"
can
have
temporal
significance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
write
"in
the
holiday
season".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume...
i
haven't
looked
at
the
dictionary...
but
"during's"
first
relationship...
first
definition,
i
suspect,
is
temporal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
indicated
that
this
issue
doesn't
come
up
very
often
as
a
practical
matter.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
i
ask
you,
do
you
have
an
answer
to
your
friend's
point
about
the
"in
which"
language?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understood
his
point
to
be
that
it's
surprising
that
they
refer
to
use
of
the
explosives
or
carrying
of
the
explosives
with
reference
to
the
underlying
felony,
"in
which"
the...
suggests
that
the
explosive
was
used
or
carried
with
respect
to
the
underlying
felony.
and
i
understood
your
position
to
be
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
in
case
07-455,
united
states
versus
ressam,
which
he
has
asked
me
to
read.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent,
ahmed
ressam,
attempted
to
enter
the
united
states
by
ferry
at
port
angeles,
washington.
hidden
in
the
trunk
of
his
rental
car
were
explosives
that
he
intended
to
detonate
at
the
los
angeles
international
airport.
he
was
subsequently
convicted
of
a
number
of
offenses,
including
making
a
false
statement
to
united
states
custom
official,
a
felony,
and
carrying
an
explosive
“during
the
commission
of”
that
felony.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
his
conviction
under
the
explosive
statute
because
it
concluded
that
the
word
“during”
as
used
in
that
statute,
included
a
requirement
that
the
explosive
be
carried
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
felony.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse
for
reasons
given
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
we
conclude
that
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
relevant
statutory
text
as
well
as
the
statute's
history
establish
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
the
government
to
prove
that
the
explosive
was
carried
during
and
in
relation
to
the
underlying
felony
but
merely
intended
to
require
that
the
two
occur
contemporaneously.
since
it
is
undisputed
that
respondent
was
carrying
explosives
when
he
made
a
false
statement
to
a
customs
official,
he
carried
explosive
during
the
commission
of
that
felony.
nothing
further
is
required
by
the
statute.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment,
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
