justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
mukasey,
is
there
any
indication
why
this
prosecutor
chose
to
hook
the
carrying
an
explosive
onto
a
false-statement
charge,
instead
of
some
charges
with
which
it
would
have
been
more
logically
linked,
like
the
one...
the
first
one,
conspiracy
to
commit
an
act
of
terror...
terrorism?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
a
difference
in
two
respects.
one
is
924(c)
has
the
"in
relationship"
requirement,
and
it
also
has
a
shorter
term.
it's
only...
in
one
it
is
five
years,
and
the
other
is
ten
years.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
maybe
they
said...
maybe
because
they're
trying
to
draft
legislation
without
using
pronouns.
[laughter]
