justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
such
an
outrageous
proposition.
you'd
certainly
acknowledge
that
the
president
and
the
senate
could
not
enter
into
a
treaty
that
required
the
states
to
do
something
that
was
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
would
be
the
situation
that
presents
the
shocking
situation
you've
just
described.
there
is
a
treaty,
but
nonetheless
it
cannot
be
enforced
domestically.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
self-enforcing.
i
thought
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
you...
you
think
this
treaty
is
self-enforcing.
you
don't
really
need
the
president's
order
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
of
a
nature
to
be
enforced
in
a
judicial
proceeding
in
texas.
texas
has
procedural
rules
that
disable
the
texas
court
from
complying
with
the
icj
judgment
here.
are
you
telling
me
that
the
icj
judgment
empowers
either
federal
or
state
courts
to
do
things
which...
which
their
laws
do
not
permit
them
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
do
you
know
of
any
other
federal
law
that...
that
interferes
in
the...
in
the
procedures
of
state
criminal
courts,
directs
them
as
to
what...
what
procedures
they
have
to
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
where?
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
unless
you're
talking
about
constitutional
requirements.
of
course,
those
are
binding
on
the
states.
but
you're
saying
that
the
federal
government
can
prescribe
state
court
procedures
and
authorize
state
courts
to
do
things
which...
which
the
state
government
does
not
authorize
them
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
the
last
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
have
no...
according
to
you,
we
would
have
no
obligation
to
enforce
this
judgment
but
for
the
president's
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
decide
to
go
back,
too.
but
would
we
have
any
authority
to
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait
a
minute.
in
order
to
get
it
to
the
security
council,
you
have
to
take
some
affirmative
action
not
to
comply?
it's
just
not
enough
simply
not
to
comply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
the
point
of
justice
ginsburg's
comment,
that
there
had
been
no
decision
not
to
comply.
don't
you
need
an
affirmative
decision
to
comply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
agree,
but
it
depends
on
whether
it's
up
to
the
president
to
make
that
call.
usually
when
we
have
treaties
that
are
not
self...
enforcing
the
judgment
of
whether
that
international
law
obligation
shall
be
made
domestic
law
is
a
judgment
for
the
congress.
congress
passes
a
law
to
enforce
the
treaty,
and
you're
telling
us
that,
well,
we
don't
need
the
congress;
the
president
can
make
a
domestic
law
by
writing
a
memo
to
his
attorney
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
not
parties
to
it.
what
do
you
mean,
"covered
by
the
judgment"?
is
this
some...
some
new
kind
of
new
kind
of
jurisdiction?
if
you're
named
in
a
suit
by
somebody
else,
you
somehow
acquire
rights
under
that
suit?
i
don't
know
of
any
such
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
people
were
not
parties
to
the...
the
countries
were
parties
to
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
president
espousing
the
judgment...
texas
takes
the
position
that
this
memorandum
has...
has
no
legal
effect;
it's
a
memorandum
from
the
president
to
the...
to
his
attorney
general.
it's
not
a
directive
to
the
states.
in
fact,
it
even
refers
to
pursuant
to
the
principles
of
comity,
which
suggests,
you
know,
do
it
if
you
want
to
be
cooperative,
don't
do
it
if
you
don't
want
to
be
cooperative.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
and
would
it
be
enough
if
the
president
simply
wrote
a
memorandum
to
himself
saying
that,
i
think
this
is
the
way
that
the...
that
the
judgment
of
the
icj
should
be
enforced?
he
doesn't
have
to
tell
texas.
he
can
just
tell
his
attorney
general?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
means
we
agree
that
the
case
can
go
before
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
will
be
a
party
before
the
court.
isn't
there
some
doubt
whether
the...
the
senate
and
the
president,
together,
can...
can
take
away
from
this
court
the
power
and
responsibility
to
decide
what
the
treaty
obligations
of
the
united
states
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
some
problem
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
there
is
a
constitutional
problem,
is
there
not,
if
they
are
automatically
enforceable?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
conferring
upon
the
icj
the
responsibility
to
decide
the
meaning
of
a
united
states
treaty
which
is
united
states
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
rather
jealous
of
that
power.
[laughter]
i
think
it
belongs
in
this
court.
and
when
you
have
a
non-self-executing
treaty,
there
is
no
problem.
it
becomes
u.s.
law
when
the
senate
and
the
house
pass
a
law
which
the
president...
it
doesn't
become
u.s.
law
because
the
president
writes
a
memorandum
to
his
attorney
general,
but
it
does
become
u.s.
law
when
a
law
is
enacted.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
solves
the
constitutional
problem,
but
in
the
situation
we're
talking
about
here,
i
don't
know
on
what
basis
we
can
allow
some
international
court
to
decide
what
is
the
responsibility
of
this
court,
which
is
the
meaning
of
the
united
states
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
people
think
that's
exactly
right,
that
really
we
expanded
federal
habeas
jurisdiction
quite
improperly.
but
it
happens
every
day,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
misunderstood.
i
thought
he
was
asking
whether
if
it
is...
assuming
it
is
not
self-executing,
this
court
can
execute
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
mean
it
does
not
automatically
become
part
of
united
states
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
follows
from
that,
that
you
have
to
change
united
states
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
change
united
states
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
had
lived
in
this
country
for
how
long?
justice
antonin
scalia
put
precisely,
it
would
be
making
it
federal
law
and
then
applying
it.
if
you
assume
it's
not
self-executing,
somebody
has
to
make
it
to
domestic
law.
now,
congress
can
obviously
do
it
by
passing
a
law.
but
you're
saying
the
court
can
do
it,
can
make
it
domestic
law
and
then
enforce
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes,
yes.
