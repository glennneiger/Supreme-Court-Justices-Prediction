justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
the
question...
and
i
apologize
if
i'm
not
paraphrasing
it
because
i
have
my
own.
this
has
arisen
frequently.
brussels
has
a
treaty,
and
that
treaty
binds
all
the
member
nations,
and
supreme
courts
of
various
nations
have
come
up
against
this
problem:
what
would
happen
if
the
brussels
court
or
the
eu
court
insists
under
the
treaty
that
we
do
something
that
violates
our
own
constitution?
i
think
this
is
an
example
of
that.
and
the
answer
typically
has
been:
well,
we'd
follow
our
own
constitution,
at
least
if
it
was
a
violation,
what
the
eu
said,
of
fundamental
human
rights
or
destroyed
some
basic
structural
part
of
our
constitution.
and
the
question
that
i
would
have
is,
doesn't
that
kind
of
approach...
not
exactly
but
that
kind
of
approach...
satisfy
whatever
problem
there
is
in
this
respect
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
icj
were
to
do
something
which
it
had
never
done,
like,
say,
put
everybody
in
jail
for
50
years...
i
don't
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing...
but
suppose
they
did,
if
they
did,
i
guess
that
might
violate
something
basic
in
our
constitution,
in
which
case
we
wouldn't
enforce
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
took
that
approach--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
you
could
spend
a
minute
explaining
that,
because,
as
i
read
the
constitution,
it
says
all
treaties
made,
or
which
shall
be
made,
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
and
the
judges
in
every
state...
i
guess
it
means
including
texas...--
[laughter]
--shall
be
bound
thereby,
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
united
states
entered
into
a
treaty.
that
treaty
said
we
will
follow
the
interpretations
and
the
judgments
of
the
international
court
of
justice
in
respect
to
the
vienna
convention.
and
that
court
did
make
a
judgment
in
that
respect,
in
respect
to
this
client,
and
it
said:
our
judgment
is
that
texas,
or
someone
in
the
united
states,
must
redo
the
procedural
hearing
simply
to
see
whether,
in
deciding
whether
there's
prejudice
or
whether
there's
a
procedural
default,
full
account
is
taken
of
the
importance
of
the
vienna
rights.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
it's
a
judgment
of
the
court.
the
united
states
has
promised
to
follow
that
judgment
of
the
court.
the
constitution
says,
since
it
promised
by
treaty,
that
is
the
law;
and
the
law
binds
the
states.
that
may
be
simple-minded,
but
i'd
like
to
hear
what
the
answer
to
that,
rather,
chain
of
logic
is...
chain
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
not
talking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
the
president's
memorandum
at
the
moment.
and
to
be...
to
disclose
fully
what
i'm
thinking,
i'm
thinking
that
maybe
if
a
president
disagreed
in
such
a
thing,
some
kind
of
a
question...
i'm
not
sure
what...
would
be
presented.
but
whatever
"what",
i
don't
worry
about
that
"what"
here,
because
the
president,
too,
agrees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
forget
whether
we
recognize
it
this
way
as
a
judgment.
i'm
saying
we
promised
in
the
treaty
to
follow
that
thing.
call
it
whatever
name
you
want.
we
promised
to
follow
that
thing,
which
i
have
in
front
of
me...
excerpts
of
which...
called
an
avena
something.
and
we
know
what
that
says.
i'm
just
looking
to
see
what
they
call
it.
they
call
it...
well,
you
tell
me
what
they
call
it.
they
call
it...
it
is
not
called
the
word
"judgment".
it's
called:
"the
appropriate
reparation
in
this
case
consists
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
to.
"
--and
then
they
listed
it.
so
i
take
it
we
have
promised
to
carry
out
that
obligation
by
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
the
words
that
the
senate
said?
because,
when
you
say
"self-executing",
the
easiest
way
for
me
to
understand
that
is
the
constitution
means
what
it
says.
but
there
happened
to
be
a
few
instances
where
the
nature
of
the
obligation
or
the
intent
of
the
party
makes
it
very
difficult
to
enforce
it
as
a
binding
judgment
of
a
court.
that
is
not
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
and
so
if
they
did
that,
now,
will
you
quote
the
words
or
give
me
the
reference
where
the
senate
said:
although
we
entered
into
this
and
although
we
ratify
it,
we're
not
going
to
do
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
then,
are
you
saying
there
are...
there
are
112,
i
believe,
treaties
in
which
we've
entered
into
promises
that
we're
going
to
follow
what
an
international
tribunal
said.
somebody
looked
up,
i
saw
on
the
internet,
that
at
this
moment
there
are
approximately
116
regulatory
entities
in
the
world
where
we've
entered,
or
others
have
entered
into,
regimes,
where
there
are
various
adjudicatory
tribunals
of
different
kinds,
mostly
commercial,
that
bind
us.
and
is
your
view:
all
of
these
thousands,
perhaps,
or
hundreds,
anyway,
of
treaties
are
unlawful,
and
that
our
promises
are
not
enforceable,
because
there's
a
constitutional
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
thinking
that
are
self-executing.
i'm
thinking
that
there
are...
like
wto,
nafta.
we
can
go
down
a
long
list
of
instances
where
the
united
states
has
promised
to
follow
the
decisions
of
tribunals
that
are
not
article
iii
courts
and
to
put
them
into
effect
at
once.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
wonder,
without
further
ado,
now,
are
you
saying
that
all
those
are
unconstitutional?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"yes"
or
"no"?
i'd
appreciate
a
"yes"
or
"no"
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
what
i
don't
understand
about
this
is
that
i
thought
that
the
icj
in
this
case
interpreted
the
treaty.
that's
not
federal
law.
that's
the
treaty.
and
it
said
that
the
treaty--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
then
i
don't
understand
you
because
the
wto
interprets
a
treaty.
it
interprets
a
treaty
that
binds
the
united
states,
just
like
the
icj
is
interpreting
a
treaty
that
binds
the
united
states.
so
what's
the
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
these
other
nations
have
an
inquisitorial
system
where
an
investigating
judge
collects
a
dossier
and
the
fact
is
noted
in
the
dossier
and
the
investigating
judge
and
the
prosecution
give
it
such
weight
as
it's
entitled
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
that
doesn't
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
an--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
course
it
matters.
but
the...
of
course
it
matters.
that's
why
when
i
read
the...
the
icj
opinion,
i
read
it
as
saying
that
they're
not
telling
you
to
set
aside
a
procedural
default
rule.
what
they've
asked
you
to
do
is
to
provide,
by
means
of
the
united
states'
own
choosing,
review
and
reconsideration
of
the
convictions
and
sentences
by
taking
account
of
the
violation
of
rights.
and
throughout
they
ask...
when
you
decided
whether
the
person
was
really
prejudiced,
when
you
decided
whether
there
had
been
forfeiture
of
the
rights,
at
that
time,
did
you
ask
yourself
that
the
reason
he
might
not
have
raised
them
was
because
he
knew
nothing
about
them
and
his
lawyer
knew
nothing
about
them,
because
nobody
ever
told
either
about
them?
in
which
case
there
might
be
a
causal
connection.
as
i
read
it,
the
icj
left
all
that
up
to
you
but
just
asked
you,
please,
look
at
it
again
having
read
our
opinion
and
keeping
this
in
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
does
the
wto
differ?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
the
wto
and
nafta
and
all
our
trade
agreements
differ?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
assume
it
is
self-executing,
just
for
one
second,
i'd
like
to
find
out...
you
said
that
the
president
was
unreasonable
in
a
sense
of
saying
texas
do
that
over
again...
i
assume
the
reason
he
asked
texas
to
have
the
hearing
is
because
the
icj
knew...
and
i
guess
maybe
he
knew...
that
the
only
hearing
they'd
had
on
this
subject...
as
far
as
i
can
see;
i
looked
at
it,
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
evidence
in
respect
to
their
finding
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
they
said
well,
he
had
a
lawyer,
but
that
lawyer
later
got
into
quite
a
lot
of
trouble,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
had
two
lawyers.
one
got
into
trouble,
and
the
other
didn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
they
vigorously
defended
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
my
point
is
there's
no
evidence
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is?
in
the
first
habeas
hearing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
the
evidence
at
the
first
habeas
hearing
that
led
the
district
judge
to
reach
his
conclusion
that
there
was
no
prejudice
and
that
the
procedural
default
was
not
excused...
it's
in
that
hearing
that
i
didn't
see
what
that
finding
was
based
on;
and
i
suppose
the
reason
that
the
president
wanted
texas
to
do
it
is
it
would
be
easiest
for
texas
to
go
back
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
in
the
first
hearing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
there
was
no
reason
for
the
icj
to
ask
the
president--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
did
happen
to
the
lawyers
texas
gave
him?
