may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
ask
this
question?
i
don't
think
you've
answered
the
chief
justice's
original
hypothetical.
it's
easy,
of
course;
they
cannot
compel
us
to
violate
our
constitution
by
a
judgment
of
their
kind.
but
what
about
the
hypothetical
that
they
said
the
sentence
for
this
man
should
be
5
years,
not
just
there
be
an
investigation
to
see
if
he's
been
prejudiced.
would
we
have
to
follow
that
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
very
case.
supposing
they
had
said
the
judgment
is
that
medellin
should
spend
5
years
in
jail
and
no
more.
would
we
have
to
honor
that
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
arguing
it's
just
the
normal
choice
of
law
problem,
that
even
though
the
judgment's
clearly
wrong
on
the
matter
of
international
law,
if
the
court
had
judgment...
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
judgment,
we
must
treat
it
as
binding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
provided
that
we
regard
these
individuals
as
though
they're
tantamount
to
the
parties
to
the
judgment
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question,
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
critical
to
me
to
understand
the
effect
of
the
judgment,
and
you
said
there
are
six
reasons
why
it's
not
an
ordinary
judgment.
i
really
would
like
to
hear
what
those
reasons
are
without
interruption
from
all
of
my
colleagues.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cruz,
could
i
go
back
to
your
discussion
of
whether
this
is
a
judgment
or
not?
it
seems
to
me
some
of
your
reasons
actually
go
to
whether
the...
whether
it
was
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
and
if
it
were
a
judgment,
would
you
agree
that
this
court
would
have
to
accept
it,
even
if
this
court
disagreed
with
its
legal
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
it
given
away
to
a
treaty
if
it
just
says
one
state
court
must
honor
a
judgment
of
a
sister
state
even
if
it
thinks
it's
dead
wrong?
is
it
giving
away
its
judicial
authority
by
obeying
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
agreed
by
treaty
to
give
it
conclusive
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
they
have...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
didn't
adopt
a
simple
solution
of
the
case,
to
say
he
got
all
the
protection;
that
there's
no
prejudice
and
therefore
there's
no
treaty
violation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
statute
really
would
not
have
divested...
if
i
understand
he
texas
law
correctly...
if
you
did
agree...
which
you
don't,
i
know...
that
there
was
a
preexisting
federal
obligation
to
honor
judgments
of
the
icj,
then
under
testa
v
katt
principle
and
howlett
opinion
and
others,
the
texas
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
sanchez-llamas
doesn't
deal
with
the
judgment.
and
it
says
a
separate
federal
obligation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
i
think
the
texas...
there
would
be
jurisdiction
in
the
texas
court
to
entertain
this
claim.
i
think
you...
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm...
you
just...
for...
putting
the
president's
assertion
to
one
side,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
did
agree...
and
i
know
you
vigorously
don't...
that
there
were
a
pre-existing
federal
obligation...
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
respect
the
judgment
of
the
icj,
which
is...
which
we
think
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
international
law;
we
have
previously
construed
the
treaties
to
the
contrary...
but
if
there
were
an
independent
obligation
to
expect...
federal
obligation...
respect
that
judgment,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
obligation
could
be
enforced
in
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
