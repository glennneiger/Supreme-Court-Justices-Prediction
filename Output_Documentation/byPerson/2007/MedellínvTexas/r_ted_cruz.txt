mr.
r.
ted
cruz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
entirety
of
the
united
states's
argument
is
predicated
on
the
idea
that
the
president's
two-paragraph
memorandum
is
in
and
of
itself
binding
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there's
no
doubt,
if
the
court
decided
it
on
the
ground
that
avena
was
a
binding
judgment,
the
president's
order
would
be
unnecessary.
i
would
note
the
united
states
strenuously
disagrees
with
that
proposition.
and,
indeed,
the
united
states
explicitly
disclaims
these
treaties
as
the
source
of
his
authority;
in
fact,
expressly
agrees
with
this
court's
decision
in
sanchez-llamas.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
certainly,
justice
breyer.
texas,
of
course,
does
not
dispute
that
the
constitution,
laws,
and
treaties
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
and
texas
statutes
must
give
way
to
any
of
these
three.
the
president's
memorandum
is
none
of
those
three.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and,
with
respect--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
the...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
avena
decision
is
not
a
judgment
in
the
sense
we
recognize
judgment
in
u.s.
courts
for
six
separate
reasons.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
except
that
when
the
senate
ratified
the
optional
protocol,
it
made
clear
that
the
optional
protocol
was
not
self-executing.
indeed,
a
point
mr.
donovan
made
in
his
argument--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--this...
this
court
has
made
clear
for
200
years
the
senate
can
ratify
a
treaty
and
yet
leave
it
not
self-executing
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
enforceable
in
u.s.
domestic
courts.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
text
of
the
treaty,
itself,
is
the
first
place
to
look.
the
text
of
article
94
of
the
un
charter
provides
that
the
remedy
is
that
the
party
may
have
recourse
to
the
security
council.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
u.s.
court.
rather,
it
is
an
international
obligation
that
is
to
be
resolved
through
political
and
diplomatic
avenues.
and
the
best
example
of
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--exactly.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
would
go
further
than
some
doubt,
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
treaty
purported
to
give
the
authority
to
make
binding
adujudications
of
federal
law
to
any
tribunal
other
than
this
court,
that
it
would
violate
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
are
hundreds
of
treaty
obligations
that
this
nation
is
committed
to
that
are
not
self-executing,
that
don't
immediately
have
force--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if...
if--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--in...
in
those
instances--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--no.
no,
we
are
not
saying
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
those
instances,
the
bodies
in
question
are
not
making
definitive
interpretations
of
what
federal
law
is.
the
best
illustration
of
this
is
the
example
mr.
donovan
used
in
his
opening
argument
where
he
said,
if
the
icj
said
to
the
united
states
cease
hostilities,
that
would
be
directed
to
the
president.
now,
under
mr.
donovan's
argument,
that's
a
clear
directive.
the
united
states
is
bound
by
treaty,
and
apparently
the
federal
courts
could
order
the
president
to
cease
hostilities
if
that
was
the
instruction
of
the
icj.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
treaty
is
federal
law,
justice
breyer.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
nature
of
this
treaty,
every...
every
position...
the
united
states
state
department
at
the
time
it
was
introduced,
the
senate,
and
every
member
of
the
senate
who
discussed
it,
understood
that
the
decisions
of
the
icj
would
not
have
binding
effect
in
u.s.
courts.
and
that
is
identical
to
the
understanding
of
every
single
nation--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
would
be
happy
to
provide
those,
justice
stevens.
the
first
reason
is
because
the
optional
protocol
is
not
self-executing,
so
it
does
not
have
force
in
united
states
courts.
the
second
reason
is,
if
it
was
a
binding
judgment,
that
would
violate
article
iii.
it
would
give
to
a
tribunal
other
than
this
court
the
authority
to
determine
federal
law.
the
third
reason
is
in
sanchez-llamas
a
majority
of
this
court
rejected
this
argument
and
provided
explicitly,
quote,
"nothing
in
the
structure
or
purpose
of
the
icj
suggests
that
its
interpretations
were
intended
to
be
conclusive
on
our
courts.
"
"the
fourth
reason
is
the
parties
in
avena
were
the
united
states
and
mexico.
"
"neither
is
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
"
"the
argument
as
to
why
it
is
binding
in
this
case
is
that
texas
is
vicariously
part
of
the
united
states.
"
"that
was
equally
true
of
oregon
in
sanchez-llamas.
"
"in
both
cases,
there's
one
state
who
is
in
some
sense
one
of
the
parties.
"
"the
fifth
reason
is
the
breard
case
was
in
many
senses
equally
a
judgment,
in
that
you
had
the
icj
issuing
an
order
to
this
court
concerning
breard,
concerning
his
specific
case,
to
stop
his
execution,
and
this
court
concluded
that
that
could
not
trump
u.s.
law.
"
"and
the
sixth
and
final
reason
that
it
is
not
a
judgment
is
to
treat
it
as
a
binding
judgment
would
be
to
cut
out
the
president's
authority
not
to
comply.
"
"everyone
agrees,
for
example
in
the
nicaragua
case,
that
the
president
retains
the
authority
to
say
no,
we're
not
going
to
comply.
"
"which
is
why
the
entire
purpose
of
this
adjudication
is
not
to
resolve
something
finally
in
a
court
of
law,
but
it
is
rather
a
diplomatic
measure,
much
as...
much
like
when
the
united
states
sued
iran
during
the
hostage
crisis.
"
"we
didn't
believe
the
ayatollah
was
going
to
listen
to
the
icj
and
suddenly
let
the
hostages
go.
"
"we
didn't...
we
didn't
expect
that
iranian
courts
would
give
force
to
it,
but
it
was
helpful
diplomatically
to
bring
it
to
that
tribunal
to
then
put
international
pressure.
"
"that--
"
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
kennedy,
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
would
agree
with
the
characterization
you
suggest,
which
is
that
the
vienna
convention
was
self-executing
in
the
sense
that
it
didn't
require
legislation
to
go
into
effect,
but
it
was
not
self-executing
in
the
sense
that
it
provided
judicially
cognizable
rights.
but
let
me
add
a
caveat
to
that,
which
is
in
both
breard
and
sanchez-llamas,
this
court
assumed
the
vienna
convention
created
individual
rights,
and
although
texas
maintains
that
it
did
not
create
individual
rights
and
the
united
states
maintains
that
it
did
not
create
individual
rights,
we
don't
have
to
win
on
that
proposition
to
prevail
in
this
case.
even
assuming
it
created
individual
rights
in
this
case,
medellin
defaulted
on
that
claim
and
this
court
held
with
sanchez-llamas
that
procedural
default
is
consistent
with
the
treaty.
and
the
real
question
here
in
this
case,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
president's
order,
is
whether
the
optional
protocol
is
self-executing,
the
decision
of
the
avena
court,
or,
as
a
subsequent
matter,
whether
the
president
has
some
sort
of
independent
authority
to
make
federal
law.
and
in
this
respect--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct
as
a
political
and
diplomatic
matter,
but
in
my
judgment
it
speaks
volumes
that
of
the
166
nations
that
signed
on
to
the
vienna
convention
and
of
the
50
nations
that
signed
on
to
the
optional
protocol,
zero...
not
a
single
nation...
treats
icj
judgments
as
binding
in
their
domestic
courts.
what
petitioners
are
arguing
here
is
for
an
interpretation
of
this
treaty
that
no
other
nation
gives.
and
in
fact,
if
i
found
myself
in
the
nation
of
mexico
and
arrested
without
consular
notification,
i
could
not
raise
this
claim
in
mexico.
the
mexican
courts
would
not
treat
it
as
a
defense
to
my
criminal
prosecution.
and
so--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
do
not
have
a
case
that
says
that,
but
neither
petitioner
nor
their
many
amici
have
been
able
to
point
to
a
single
instance.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
given
that
these
treaties
are
four
decades
old,
that
that
speaks
volumes
that
no...
no
nation
has
accorded
binding
force
to
icj--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
breyer,
i...
i
think
you
could
well
be
right,
but
i
think
that
also
speaks
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
this.
procedural
default
only--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--matters
in
system
like
the
united
states'
where
habeas
allows
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
most
other
countries
don't
allow
criminal
defendants
to
relitigate
criminal
matters,
in
which
case
procedural
default
matters.
the
other
countries
simply
deny
it
altogether.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
the
icj's
decision...
i
think
your
question
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
effect
of
an
icj
decision.
the
legal...
legal
adviser
to
the
state
department
told
the
senate,
when
it
was
ratifying
the
un
charter,
that
decisions
of
the
icj
are
"a
moral
obligation"
and
there
is
"no
provision"
for
the
enforcement
of
such
decisions.
and
one
fascinating
example
of
this
is
the
entire
debate
over
the
connally
amendment.
one
can
look
in
the
entire
course
of
legislative
history,
and
it's
an
argument
back
and
forth
about
whether
it
is
wise
to
require
the
united
states
to
cast
a
veto
in
the
security
council
over
an
attempt
to
enforce
an
icj.
and
not
a
single
senator
of
the
entire
u.s.
senate
suggested
the
proposition
that
icj
decisions
might
be
independently
enforceable.
nobody
discussing
that
understood
it
that
way.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
scalia,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
imperative--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
wto
and
nafta...
i
mean
nafta
is
not
a
treaty.
it's
a
congressional
agreement,
but
it
is
also
adjudicating
specific
factual
questions
that
deal
with
the
application
of
facts
to
a
particular
circumstance.
it's
not
interpreting
the
treaty
and
purporting
to
bind
the
united
states
on
this
is
what
the
underlying
federal
law
means.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
right.
and
it
could
choose
not
to.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
consequence
of
the
argument
that
it
doesn't
create
individual
rights
would
mean
that
that
individual
defendant
could
not
raise
it
in
that--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--yes.
and
so
in
that
circumstance,
it
would
mean,
if
a
judge
declined
to
comply
with
that
obligation,
the
individual
defendant
would
not
have
an
appealable
legal
error.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
no,
not
at
all.
in
fact,
just
as
this
court
did
in
breard
and
sanchez-llamas,
it
assumes
that
the
vienna
convention
created
individual
rights.
and
so
we
don't
need
to
prevail
on
that
to
reach
the
identical
outcome.
because
even
assuming
we
are
incorrect
concerning
individual
rights,
the
sanchez-llamas
holding
is
that
procedural
default
respects
those
rights
just
as
fully
as
it
respects
constitutional
rights.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
also
in
your
hypothetical,
your
hypothetical
assumes
a
a
deliberate
violation
of
the
law
which
no
one
suggests
here
rather
than
inadvertence.
and
inadvertence
complied
with,
as
you
suggested
earlier,
no
prejudice
whatsoever.
and
there
has...
both
the
federal
and
state
courts
that
looked
at
this
concluded
that
there
was
no
even
arguable
prejudice
from
the
violation.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
stevens,
i
would
not,
because
i
do
not
believe
consistent
with
article
iii
this
court's
authority
can
be
given
away
by
treaty.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
provided
by
the
constitution.
and
in
this
instance,
giving
any
other
entity,
the
authority
to
make
a
conclusive
determination
of
federal
law,
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
article
iii
power.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if
the
senate
agreed
that
this
was
self-executing,
then
you
would
have
the
height
of
the
presidency
and
congress
working
together.
but
even
in
that
situation,
i
would
submit
as
a
matter
of
separation
of
powers,
they
could
not
give
this
court's
essential
role,
under
marbury,
to
say
what
the
law
is
to
another
body.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
in
enforcing
foreign
judgments,
the
foreign
court
is
not
purporting
to
make
a
definitive
determination
of
u.s.
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
ginsburg,
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
united
states
for
over
four
decades
from
the
day
this
treaty
was
ratified
that
the
optional
protocol
was
not
self-executing,
was
not
enforceable
in
u.s.
courts.
so
it
is
not
a
judgment
that
has...
were
this
court
to
treat
it
as...
as
a
judgment,
it
would
be
making
that
treaty
self-executing.
and
the
power
to
transform
a
non--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
that's
exactly
correct.
and
the
president
had
a
number
of
constitutional
means
at
his
disposal
to
comply,
had
he
chosen.
the...
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--there
are
three
avenues
that
the
president
could
have
chosen
that
would
have
been
constitutional.
the
first
of
which
he
could
have
gone
to
congress
and
proposed
a
statute
amending
the
aedpa
to
allow
federal
habeas
review.
the
second
is
he
could
have
negotiated
a
treaty,
submitted
it--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
federal
government
cannot
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
there
is
a
state--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--well,
and--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--a
corollary--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
does.
and
a
corollary
to
this
is
if
congress
could
pass
a
statute
creating
a
federal
right
to
review,
and
that
federal
right
to
review
under
the
principles
of
testa
versus
katt
would
have
to
be
respected
in
the
state
court.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
well,
if
it
were
a
federal
right
to
review,
under
testa
versus
katt,
both
the
state
and
federal
courts
would
give
review.
interestingly
enough,
if
it
were
a
new
federal
right,
it
would
clear
the
jurisdictional
bar
because
the
texas
jurisdictional
bar
allows
an
exception
for
a
new
law.
so
if
congress
passed
a
new
law
that
would
be
jurisdiction
to
raise--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--a
law
passed
by
congress
saying
in
order
to
give
effect
to
the
avena
judgments
the
51
mexican
nationals
at
issue
shall
be
entitled
to
review
and
reconsideration
of
whether
there
was
prejudice
from
the
denial
of
the
vienna
convention.
that
law
would
be
respected
equally.
i
would
suggest
that
testa
versus
katt,
which
petitioner
uses,
is
a
case
which
powerfully
supports
texas,
because
the
principle
of
testa
versus
katt
was
there
is
one
federal
law
that
must
be
applied
equally
in
federal
courts
and
state
courts.
and
the
state
courts
are
not
at
liberty
to
ignore
federal
law.
this
is
a
very
curious
assertion
of
presidential
power.
because
the
presidential
power
is
not
directed
at
the
federal
courts.
it
is
directed
at
the
state
courts,
and
the
state
courts
alone.
and
i
would
submit
is
the
only
instance
i'm
aware
of,
of
a
federal
mandate
that
falls
only
on
the
states,
singles
out
the
states,
and
commandeers
those
judges.
in
over
200
years
of
our
nation's
history
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
directive
from
the
president
directly
to
the
state
courts
and
state
judges.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
absolutely--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--and
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
a
powerful
parallel
is
the
decision
of
this
court
last
near
in
hamdan.
in
hamdan
the
president
was
at
the
height
of
his
war
powers
authority.
and
nonetheless,
this
court
concluded
that
he
could
not
act
contrary
to
the
will
of
congress.
here
his
interests
are
far
less
than
prosecuting
war,
and
yet
he
is
asserting
the
authority
to
go
it
alone,
despite
a
consistent
stream
of
congressional
disapproval,
both
in
ratifying
these
treaties
and
saying
they're
not
self-executing
and
also
in
passing
the
aedpa.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
this
letter
was
sent
out
to
all
affected
states,
but
it
is...
the
united
states
is
quite
candid
in
what
they
are
doing.
the
department
to
its
credit
describes
it
as
5
of
the
memo,
or
memo
page
6,
rather:
the
president's
memorandum
is
sufficient
to
create
a
binding
legal
rule.
the
department
is
not
hiding
what
they're
arguing.
they're
not
arguing
the
treaties
require
it.
they're
not
arguing
any
statutes
requiring
it.
they're
saying
a
two-paragraph
memorandum
from
the
president
to
a
member
of
the
cabinet
is
binding
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i'm
quoting
the
united
states'
brief
in
this
proceeding,
page
6
of
the
brief.
on
page
5
it
also
describes
the
president's
power
as
"establishing
binding
rules
of
decisions
that
preempt
contrary
state
law.
"
if
that
is
correct,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
president
could
not
have
directed
his
memorandum
to
the
federal
district
courts
or
even
to
this
court,
and
that
is
an
extraordinarily
broad
power
to
be
asserted
on
behalf
of
the
executive.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
this
court
has
the
final
authority
to
determine
what
federal
law
is,
and
so
if
this
court
determines
that
that's
what
the
treaty
requires,
then
that
be
federal
law.
now
i
would
suggest
that
would
require
overruling--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--in
my
judgment,
if
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
it
would
be
error.
but--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--in
my
judgment
it
would
be
wholly
illegitimate
for
the
court
to
do
so.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
because--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
rule
is
a
constitutional
rule,
that
the
president
makes
treaties
the
senate
advises
and
consents.
and
the
limitation--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
limitations
the
senate
put
on
are
it
as
much
a
part
of
the
treaty
as
the
treaty
itself,
and
the
consequences--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--if
this
court
did
so,
in
my
judgment
it
would
be
usurping
the
role
of
congress.
all
right?
because
the
essence
of
the
decision--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
essence
of
the
decision
by
the
senate
to
say
something
is
non-self-executing
is
to
say
if
something
in
this
treaty
is
going
to
change
u.s.
domestic
law,
you
have
to
come
back
to
us.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
exactly
what
it
means.
if
you
want
to
change
u.s.
law,
come
to
congress.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
indeed.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
exactly.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
he
had
two
lawyers.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
and
they
vigorously
defended
him.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
only
argument--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--with
respect,
justice
breyer,
there
actually
is.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
the
evidence
there
is--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--in
our
appendix
there
is
an
affidavit
from
the
mexican
consulate.
once
the
mexican
consulate
started
assisting
medellin,
they
prepared
an
affidavit,
and
the
affidavit
said
if
we
had
been
contacted,
we
would
have
told
you
not
to
confess;
and
we
would
have
told
you
to
get
a
lawyer.
the
problem
with
that
is
medellin
confessed
within
about
three
hours
of
being
arrested,
and
even
the
icj
in
avena
said
that
notification
had
to
occur
within
72
hours.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
justice
breyer...
it
was
part
of
the
state
court
record,
and
it
was
the
basis
for
saying
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
believe
it
was.
and
it's
included
in
our
appendix
four.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
it
is
difficult
to
explain.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that
is
completely
correct,
and
he
waived
those
in
writing.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
practically
his
entire
life.
wrote
and
read
english
and
was
educated
in
american
public
schools.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
both
of
them
vigorously
defended
him,
and
in
medellin
we
devoted
several
pages
of
our
brief
to
going
through
in
considerable
detail
the
many
motions
they
filed.
it
was
a
vigorous
defense,
and
yet
they
failed
to
raise
this
particular--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
didn't
have
it
as
option
to
say,
it
would
have
been
easier,
one
might
say,
to
just
go
along.
the
president
is
asking
you
to
do
this,
make
the
whole
thing
go
away;
just
go
along.
the
problem
is
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
a
statute,
and
a
statute
that
divested
of
jurisdiction
unless
there
is
new
federal
law.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
although
that
holding
would
be,
i
would
suggest,
in
considerable
tension
if
not
directly
contrary
to
sanchez-llamas.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
oregon
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
united
states
as
texas.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
do
not,
because
it
has
to
be
a
new
claim,
and
if
this
were
a
judgment,
the
judgment...
plaintiff's
co-counsel:
it
would
be
a
new
claim
based
on
a
new
judgment
which
was
after
sanchez...
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
that
case.
let
me
point
out
one
consequence
of...
of
the
president's
assertion
of
authority.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
if...
although
i
disagree
with
the
premise.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
but
if
the
premise
were
true,
i
don't
disagree
with
the
conclusion.
the
statute
allows
jurisdiction
where
there
is
a
new
legal
basis
that
was
not
previously
available.
the
only
two
potential
sources
of
that
are
avena,
which
we
submit
is
a
non-self-executing
international
law
obligation,
or
the
president's
order;
and,
in
fact,
it
is
worth
underscoring
if
the
united
states'
theory
is
correct,
there's
no
reason
why
the
president
needed
to
wait
for
a
decision
from
the
icj.
if
the
president
has
the
authority
to
take
a
non-self-executive
international
law
treaty
and
order
it
to
be
implemented
and
set
aside
any
state
law
to
the
contrary--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--i
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
united
states
does
not.
the
united
states
believes
that
the
president
has
the
authority
to
make
decisions
and
to
implement
treaties...
an
independent
authority
to
create
new
binding
law,
even
though
the
obligation
is
not
self-executing.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
there
are
51.
there
were
15
in
the
state
of
texas.
there
are
now
14
because
1
was
under
the
age
of
18,
so
is
now
off
of
death
row;
51
in
9
states
across
the
country.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
not
that
we're
aware
of,
no.
there
have...
the
51...
my
understanding
is
it's
down
to
44.
for
various
reasons
these
individuals
are
not
on
death
row
but,
other
than
oklahoma,
not
related
to
the
avena
decision.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
exactly
right;
and,
in
fact,
in
paragraph
34
of
avena
it
asserted
the
authority
to
annul
u.s.
criminal
convictions.
so
some
of
the
hypotheticals
coming
from
bench,
under
the
icj--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--justice
ginsburg,
you're
correct
they
did
not
order
the
annulment.
but
in
paragraph
34
they
asserted
they
could
order
the
annulment.
they
simply
were
choosing--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--not
to
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
that's
correct.
so
it
is
not
just
the
sentence;
and,
in
fact,
they,
despite
the
fact
that
their
statute
does
not
allow
them
to
have
precedent
in
any
other
cases,
they
said
in
paragraph
151:
the
fact
that
the
court's
ruling
concerned
only
mexican
nationals
cannot
be
taken
to
imply
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
present
judgment
do
not
apply
to
other
foreign
nationals
finding
themselves
in
situations.
they
were
in
an
unprecedented
act
recording
the
authority
to
bind
u.s.
courts
in
a
way,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
no--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--but
they
can
issue
a
decision
that
can
be
enforced
by
the
security
council.
and
had
they
issued--
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
--it
has
gone...
for
example,
in
the
nicaragua
case,
there
was
an
effort
to
take
it
to
the
security
council
there.
mr.
r.
ted
cruz
correct.
and
that's
part
of
a
diplomatic
treaty,
where
it's
between
nations
is...
is
that
it
is
not
binding
in
the
sense
that
the
domestic
courts
will
enforce
it.
indeed,
if
the
icj
had
asserted
the
power
it
claimed
to
annul
u.s.
convictions,
under
the
u.s.'s
theory
the
president
presumably
could
have
issued
an
order
effectively
pardoning
state
prisoners
despite
the
fact
that
the
constitution
limits
its
pardon
authority
to
federal
crimes.
