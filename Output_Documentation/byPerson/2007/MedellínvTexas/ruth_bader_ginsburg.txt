justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
icj
ever
issue
a
judgment
of
that
character?
it
issues
a
judgment
between
two
nations,
two
or
more
nations,
and
it
is
instructs
the
united
states
to
do
something.
i'm
not
aware
of
any...
any
decision
of
the
icj
that
says
what
a
sentence
should
be
for
a
particular
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
had
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you
had
a
treaty
on
the
recognition
and
enforcement
of
judgments,
mutual
recognition
and
enforcement,
then
we
would
enforce
the
judgment
that
we
agreed
to
enforce
by
treaty.
we
wouldn't
look
behind
it
to
see
if
we
agreed
with
it
on
the
merits.
are
you
saying
that
this
undertaking,
this
agreement
to
submit
to
the
compulsory
jurisdiction
of
the
icj
gives
the
judgment
in
the
particular
case,
although
not
precedential
effect,
the
counterpart
to
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it
becomes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
it
becomes
a
penal
judgment,
and
i
thought
the
rule
was
that
no
country
forces...
enforces
another
country's
penal
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this
man
goes
to
jail
for
5
years,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
penal
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
didn't
mention
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
didn't
mention
the
optional
protocol
which
is...
is
where
the
united
states
gave
its
promise.
it
voluntarily
accepted
this
jurisdiction.
it
didn't
have
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
would
take
an
action
by
somebody
in
the
country.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
here
that
hasn't...
that
hasn't
happened.
94
would
never
be
triggered
because
we
haven't
said
we're
breaking
our
promise,
we're
not
going
to
comply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
don't...
if
you
don't
comply,
you
don't
comply.
but
we...
certainly
not...
in
that
situation
here,
the
president
said
the
united
states
agreed
that
it
would
submit
to
the
binding
jurisdiction
for
one
case
only,
and
we
are
bound
by
that
judgment
and
i'm
going
to
enforce
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general,
can
we
just
clarify
something
which
i
think
is
important?
justice
scalia
suggested
that
this
wasn't
self-executing.
the
state
department
with
respect
to
the
vienna
convention
itself
told
congress
very
clearly:
you
don't
have
to
do
anything;
this
is
self-executing.
and
then
the
protocol
says:
we
the
united
states
agree
to
accept
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icj
in
a
certain
class
of
cases.
and
congress
ratified
that,
too.
so
i
don't
think
that
self-executing
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
nicaragua
the
united
states
took
the
position
from
day
1
that
the
icj
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
so
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
is
always
an
exception
to
the
obligation,
even
within
the
united
states,
to
give
full
faith
and
credit.
if
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
another
state
doesn't
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit.
but
if
it
does
have
jurisdiction,
then
the
obligation
kicks
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
after
there's
a
breach,
but
we...
let's
stick
to
the
protocol,
the
optional
protocol...
optional.
the
protocol
says:
we
accept
the
compulsory
jurisdiction
of
the
icj.
"jurisdiction"
means
power.
we
agree
that
in
cases
of
this
character,
vienna
convention
violation
cases,
we
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
x
tribunal,
the
icj.
what
is
there
that
needs
execution
about
that?
congress
said
yes,
the
united
states,
the
executive
branch
of
the
united
states
decides
that
it's
a
good
idea
to
submit
to
the...
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icj.
we
ratify
that.
and
i
don't
see
anything
left
for
congress
to
do.
it
said
the
united
states
can
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icj.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
still...
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
that
optional
protocol.
it...
was
it
submission
to
jurisdiction?
my
understanding
is
that
any
two
parties
that
can
agree,
can
have
a
formed
selection
clause,
can
agree
that
we
accept
the
authority
of
this
tribunal,
and
then
it
follows
from
that
that
if
you
accept
their
authority
to
adjudicate,
you
are
bound
to
follow
its
decisions.
and
that
that
seems
to
be
understood
in
the
world
community
because,
is
it
not
so
that
even
though
there
are
cases
like
nicaragua
and
iran,
most
icj
judgments
are
indeed
complied
with
by
the
nations
that
agree
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
tribunal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
a
case
that
says
that?
a
mexican
case
that
says
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
maybe
it
hasn't
come
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
cruz--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
saying
that
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
we
couldn't
have
a
treaty
with
another
country
on
the
mutual
recognition
and
enforcement
of
judgment,
because
the
other
country
might
get
it
wrong,
we
might
disagree
with
its
interpretation
of
the
law,
and,
therefore,
unlike
the
rest
of
the
world,
the
united
states
can't
get
the
advantage
of
a
reciprocal
guarantee
that
our
judgments
will
be
respected,
and
in
turn
we
will
respect
your
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
may
be
that
if
the
case
turns
on
a
question
of
u.s.
law,
and
we
may
think,
as
many
think
about
the
icj,
that
they
got
that
question
wrong.
still,
it's
always
been
if
you
don't
look
behind
the
judgment.
you
say
in
the
next
case
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
apply
that
wrong
interpretation.
but
here
i'm
bound
by
a
judgment.
and
that's
why
i
questioned
your
use...
your
heavy
use
of
sanchez-llamas.
i
agreed
with
the
court
in
that
case
because
it
was
a
question
of
interpretation.
we
don't
have
to
agree
with
the
icj.
we
were
not
faced
with
a
decision,
a
binding
adjudication,
which
we
accept
for
that
case
only.
so
there's
a
difference
between
sanchez-llamas
and
this
case
that
you
appear
not
to
recognize
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said
that...
oh,
you
said
that
this
is
a
matter
of
goodwill
or
that
most
icj
judgments...
icj
judgments,
they're
not
binding
but
people
comply...
nations
comply
with
them
as
a
matter
of
goodwill?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
could...
other
than...
i
mean,
the
most
logical
place
to
have
this
go
on
is
the
court
that
rendered
the
judgment.
it's
always
better
for
the
court
that
rendered
the
judgment
than
some
foreign
court
or
another
state
court.
so
what
else
could
the
president
do?
the
icj
did
say
u.s.,
as
a
matter
of
your
own
choosing.
and
the
president
chose
the
most
logical
forum,
but
what
else
could
he
have
done?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
start
with
the
first
one.
why
should
this
case
be
in
federal
court?
it's
a
state
judgment
that's
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
have
the
federal
court
overseeing
the
state
court
and
telling
the
state
what
to
do?
that
seems
to
me
practically
much
more
of
an
encroachment
on
state
authority
than
to
say,
state
courts,
you
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
to
say
federal
courts,
you
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
would
be
doing
the
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
law
passed
by
congress
saying
texas
dispense
with
your
procedural
bar
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what's
absent
in
your
view
is
congress.
you
say
that
all
of
this
could
have
been
done--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
texas
could
have
been
ordered,
but
the
president
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
it
just
on
the
basis
of
the
icj,--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
not
self-executing
in
the
position
of
the
state
department,
wasn't
there...
in
the
parallel
proceedings
in
oklahoma,
wasn't
there
a
letter
from
the
current...
the
then
current
legal
adviser
telling
oklahoma
that
this
is
a
judgment
that's
binding
on
all
courts
in
the
united
states,
state
and
federal,
and
that
the
president
has
directed
oklahoma
to
comply?
i
think
that
was
sent
both
to
the
governor
and
the
other
officials.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which...
which
letter
are
you
quoting?
are
you
quoting--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
there
is.
we
have
interpreted
the
law,
and
we
have
said
as
far
as
what
article
36
means,
we
disagree
with
the
icj.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
oklahoma
has
taken
the
opposite
position,
and
they...
they
did
give
the
review
and
reconsideration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
has
any
other
state
acted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
icj
flatly
refused
mexican...
mexico
said
icj
annulled
the
judgment.
the
icj
said
no,
and
it
didn't
vacate
it,
either.
it
just
said
that
it
did
a
reconsideration
to
see
whether
there
was
prejudice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
their
very
own
statute,
the
statute
setting
up
the
icj,
makes
it
clear
that
is
not
the
case.
they
can
issue
a
binding
judgment
in
the
particular
case.
it
has
no
precedential
effect
for
other
cases,
not
even
within
the
icj.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
that
ever
happened?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
u.s.
exercised
its
veto.
