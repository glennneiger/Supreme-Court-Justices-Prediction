chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-984,
medellin
v.
texas.
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
would
enforce
those
constraints?
the
thing
that
concerns
me
about
your
position
is
that
it
seems
to
leave
no
role
for
this
court
in
interpreting
treaties
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
suppose,
for
example,
that
the
international
court
of
justice
determined
in
this
case
its
judgment
was
the
same,
but
they
added:
as
a
matter
of
deterrence,
we
think
the
officers
who
failed
to
give
consular
warning
should
each
be
sentenced
to
5
years
in
jail.
that's
the
icj
determination.
would
this
court
have
a
role
in
reviewing
that
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
we
determine--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
we
determine,
even
if
we
determine
that
that
judgment
is
based
on
a
legal
error?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
icj
determined
that
the
officers
should
each
go
to
jail
for
5
years,
we
would
have
no
basis
for
reviewing
that
judgment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
still
looking
for
an
answer
to
the
hypothetical.
what
would
be
the
basis
for
this
court's
reviewing
the
icj's
determination
that
officers
should
go
to
jail
for
5
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
court
doesn't
have
executive
power.
it
has
judicial
power.
it's
already
exercised
that
judicial
power
in
sanchez-llamas
in
determing
the
meaning
of
this
treaty.
and
i
understood
your
position
to
be
that
we
have
no
authority
to
construe
the
treaty
in
this
case
because
a
judgment
was
issued
by
the
international
court
of
justice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--just
to
get
back,
you're
conceding,
i
take
it,
whether
the
icj
has
done
something
like
this
before
or
not...
and
we
can
debate
whether
what
they've
done
in
this
case
is
precisely
that...
there
is
a
role
for
this
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
judgment
of
the
icj
should
be
enforced.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
enforcing
the
obligation
to
comply
or,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
determining
the
legal
basis
for
the
icj
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
answer
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
the
answer
to
either
my
or
justice
stevens's
hypothetical
then,
yes,
we
do
have
to
enforce
an
icj
judgment
of
that
sort?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
why
don't...
why
don't
you
take
5
extra
minutes?
and
we'll
give
you
your
rebuttal
time.
if
the
avena
judgment
is
binding
as
federal
law,
is
it
your
position,
though,
that
the...
this
court
has
no
authority
to
review
the
content
of
that
federal
law...
the
judgment?
our
choice
is
simply
enforce
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
have
no
authority
to
review
the
judgment
itself,
even
though
the
judgment
will
have
the
effect
as
federal
law
of
preempting
the
state
law
in
this
instance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
excuse
me,
but
your
position
is
not
that
we
are
applying
the
obligation
to
comply,
because
we
interpreted
that
in
sanchez-llamas
and
came
to
the
exact
opposite
conclusion
as
the
icg
here.
what
you're
saying
is
it's
different
here
because
the
operative
law
is
the
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
determines
that
the
judgment
should
not
be
enforced
and
this
court
determines,
based
on
our
construction
of
the
treaty
and
the
judgment
that
it
should
be
enforced,
which
determination
controls?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
have
the
authority
to
determine
whether
the
treaty
should
be
complied
with
in
the
face
of
a
presidential
determination,
why
don't
we
have
the
independent
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
be
complied
with
at
a
matter
of
federal
law
without
regard
to
the
president's
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
donovan.
we'll
give
you
5
minutes
for
your
rebuttal.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
president
had
said,
we're
going
to
comply
with
this
judgment,
but
in
a
different
way
than
the
icj
determined.
we're
going
to
comply
by
examining
in
each
case
whether
there's
already
been
a
determination
of
prejudice,
and
if
there
has
then
there's
no
further
review,
but
if
there
hasn't
then
there'll
be
further
review.
would
that
be
binding
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
the
same
as
a
memorandum
just
like...
it's
a
memorandum
just
like
the
one
we
have
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
says
that
if
there
has
already
been...
the
state
courts
are
to
determine
if
there's
already
been
a
determination
of
prejudice
in
the
case,
and
if
there
has
there's
to
be
no
further
review.
but
if
they
determine
there
hasn't,
there
is
to
be
further
review.
that's
different
than
the
icj's
judgment,
which
suggests
there
should
be
a
new
determination
in
every
case.
is
that...
does
that
have
the
same
status
as
the
memorandum
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
can...
he
can
take
action
that's
inconsistent
with
the
determination
of
federal
law
by
this
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
we
determined
in
sanchez-llamas
that
the
treaty
did
not
mean
what
the
icj
said
it
means
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
doubt
that
the
judgment
here
is
based
on
a
determination
of
the
vienna
convention
that's
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
we
determined
last
year?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
none
of
those
cases
were
we
talking
about
a
determination
contrary
to
a
legal
determination
by
this
court
concerning
the
scope
of
powers
under
the
treaty.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
cruz,
by
my
count
we'll
give
you
an
extra
10
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
no
prejudice
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
had
received
full
miranda
warnings,
which
went
beyond
what
the
consulate
was
going
to
tell
him?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
fact
that
they're
on...
on
death
row
isn't
at
all
significant
because
the
judgment
of
the
icj
purports
to
vacate
the
convictions
as
well;
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
page--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
looking
at
page
186.
they
require
review
and
reconsideration
of
the
conviction
and
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cruz.
mr.
donovan,
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
read
the
comegys
case,
however
you
say
it,
to
be
for
the
exact
opposite
proposition.
there
they
were
saying,
this
is
an
international
arbitration,
there's
no
reason
to
go
behind
it.
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
arbitration
is
binding
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
that
was
at
issue
there
was
very
much
one
for
the
u.s.
supreme
court
to
make.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
authority...
i
get
back
to
where
i
started.
i
understood
you
to
concede
that
we
would
have
authority
to
construe
the
judgment
if
it
provided,
for
example,
for
a
punitive
sanction
against
the
officers.
what
is
the
basis
under
your
theory
for
that
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
can...
it
can
contravene
our
interpretation
of
the
treaty
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
the
authority
to
interpret
the
judgment
of
the
icj?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
we
have
the
authority
to
interpret
it,
we
have
the
authority
to
construe
whether
it's
carry
to
the
constitution,
but
we
do
not
the
authority
to
consider
whether
it's
consistent
with
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
06-984,
medellin
versus
texas.
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
treaty
known
as
the
vienna
convention.
that
treaty
provides
that
if
a
foreign
citizen
is
arrested,
he
has
the
right
to
get
help
from
the
representative
of
his
home
country
and
to
be
told
of
that
right.
in
this
case,
petitioner
medellin
was
arrested
in
texas
in
connection
with
the
brutal
gang
rape
and
murder
of
two
girls
aged
14
and
16.
he
had
lived
in
the
united
states
since
preschool,
but
was
a
citizen
of
mexico.
upon
arrest,
medillin
was
advised
of
his
miranda
rights,
waived
them
in
writing
and
gave
a
detailed
confession.
he
was
not,
however,
advised
of
his
rights
under
the
vienna
convention.
medillin
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
after
his
conviction
became
final,
medillin
argued
that
it
should
be
set
aside
because
of
the
vienna
convention
violation.
the
state
courts
rejected
that
argument
on
the
ground
that
it
had
not
been
raised
in
a
timely
manner
under
state
law.
meanwhile,
the
government
of
mexico
brought
a
complaint
on
behalf
of
medillin
and
50
other
similarly
situated
mexican
citizens
seeking
relief
for
the
violation
of
their
vienna
convention
rights.
mexico
brought
this
complaint
against
the
united
states
in
the
international
court
of
justice.
the
international
court
of
justice,
or
icj,
is
an
international
tribunal
located
in
the
hague
that
was
established
pursuant
to
the
united
nations
charter.
the
icj
found
in
favor
of
mexico
ruling
that
the
united
states
should
require
a
reconsideration
of
medillin's
vienna
convention
claim
despite
his
failure
to
comply
with
state
procedural
rules
governing
such
challenges.
in
the
case
of
sanchez-llamas
versus
oregon,
decided
in
this
court
less
than
two
years
ago,
we
confronted
a
claim
by
foreign
nationals
not
included
in
the
icj's
judgment
who
similarly
argued
that
the
vienna
convention
required
that
state
law
be
set
aside
in
their
cases.
we
rejected
that
claim,
disagreeing
with
the
icj's
interpretation
of
the
vienna
convention,
holding
instead
that
the
convention
does
not
trump
state
procedural
rules.
now,
following
the
icj's
decision
and
notwithstanding
our
decision
in
sanchez-llamas,
medillin
filed
another
application
for
relief
in
texas
state
court.
he
argued
that
because
the
united
states
agreed
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icj
when
it
signed
the
vienna
convention,
the
icj
judgment
was
itself
automatically
federal
law
that
required
texas
to
set
aside
its
contrary
state
rules
no
matter
what
this
court
had
said
in
sanchez-llamas.
the
texas
courts
rejected
that
claim
we
granted
review.
going
all
the
way
back
to
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
john
marshall,
this
court
has
explained
that
there
are
two
types
of
treaties.
the
president
can
negotiate
and
the
senate
can
ratify
a
treaty
that
on
its
terms
specifies
that
its
provisions
can
automatically
become
federal
law.
such
a
treaty
is
called
self-executing
and
it
does
indeed
trump
contrary
state
and
even
federal
law.
the
other
type
is
a
treaty
that
is
not
self-executing
and
its
provisions
become
federal
law
only
if
congress
passes
and
the
president
signs,
implementing
legislation,
giving
that
effect
to
them.
we
conclude
that
the
icj
judgment
did
not
automatically
become
federal
law,
overriding
state
law
under
the
supremacy
clause
because
the
treaties
pursuant
to
which
the
united
states
agreed
to
icj
jurisdiction
do
not
provide
that
icj
judgments
would
be
self-executing.
for
example,
the
un
charter
says
that
member
states
will
"undertake
to
comply"
with
icj
judgments,
which
is
different
from
saying
they
are
automatically
effective
as
domestic
law.
the
relevant
treaties
provide
that
icj
judgments
were
to
be
enforced
through
the
un
security
council
and
the
united
states
knew
that
it
could
always
block
enforcement
if
it
disagreed
with
an
icj
judgment
by
exercising
its
security
council
veto.
that
right
would
be
taken
away
if
icj
judgments
were
automatically
enforceable
as
federal
law
without
more.
there
are
currently
47
nations
that
have
submitted
to
icj
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
not
one
treats
icj
judgments
as
binding
law
in
their
courts
as
medillin
argues
we
should.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
icj
decision
does
not
require
texas
to
set
aside
its
state
law
and
reconsider
medillin's
conviction,
but
there
is
more
to
the
case.
after
the
icj
decision,
the
president
sent
a
memorandum
to
the
attorney
general
stating
that
the
united
states
would
discharge
its
international
obligations
under
the
icj
decision
"by
having
state
courts
give
effect
to
the
decision."
medillin
argues
that
even
if
the
icj
judgment
does
not
by
itself
require
texas
to
reconsider
his
vienna
convention
claim,
the
president's
memorandum
does.
the
solicitor
general
agrees.
we
do
not.
in
this
area,
federal
law
that
displaces
state
law
can
be
created
in
one
of
two
ways.
first,
congress
can
pass
a
law
that
the
president
signs
or
whose
veto
is
overridden,
or
second,
the
president
can
make
and
the
senate
can
ratify
a
self-executing
treaty.
you
will
notice
that
there's
something
about
each
of
these
options.
each
requires
action
by
both
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches.
as
a
general
manner,
the
framers
did
not
trust
one
branch,
acting
alone,
to
create
federal
law.
here,
the
argument
is
that
the
president
acting
alone
created
federal
law
that
displaces
state
law.
we
do
not
accept
that
proposition
under
the
circumstances
before
us.
accordingly,
neither
the
icj
judgment
nor
the
president's
memorandum
give
rise
--
gives
rise
to
federal
law
that
displaces
the
application
of
texas
state
law.
the
decision
below
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
written
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
written
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
joined.
