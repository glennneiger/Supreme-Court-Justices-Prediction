mr.
donald
francis
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
president
and
the
senate
entered
into
three
treaties,
the
optional
protocol,
the
un
charter,
and
the
icj
statute,
by
which
the
united
states
agreed
that
it
would
comply
with
the
icj's
decision
in
any
case
to
which
it
was
a
party.
we
now
have
such
a
decision,
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
determined
that
the
united
states
should
comply.
texas,
however,
tells
this
court
that
it
should
tell
the
world
that
the
framers
left
us
a
constitution
in
which
neither
this
court
nor
the
president
nor
maybe
even
congress
could
ensure
that
the
united
states
kept
the
promise
that
its
elected
representatives
made
to
its
treaty
partners.
texas's
position
is
directly
contrary
to
the
constitutional
design.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
yes.
the
constitution--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--there
would
be
constitutional...
there
might
be
affirmative
constitutional
constraints
on
the
enforcement
of
a
treaty,
but
there
are
none
here.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
this
court
would
have
a
role
in
reviewing
that
judgment,
and
here's...
here's
the
question.
this
court
has
an
obligation,
has
the
authority,
to
say
what
the
law
is.
in
this
case
the
obligation
is,
in
fact,
to
comply
with
the
judgment,
itself.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
and
if
that
obligation--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
question...
that's
the
basis
of
submitting
a
dispute
to
a
third-party
dispute-resolution
mechanism,
yes.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
that
would
be...
well,
that
would
be
a...
raise
a
separate
obstacle.
if
i
may
answer
the
questions
in
turn,
first--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that
is
correct.
the
icj
decides
disputes
between
nations,
but
those
disputes
may
involve
the
nations'
obligation
as
to
specific
individuals.
in
this
case--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
as
i
say,
there
are
two--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it's...
with
respect,
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
the
court
has
acted
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
indeed,
the
president
has
determined
otherwise.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
but
if
the
court,
itself...
if
the
icj,
itself,
made
a
determination
as
to
a
dispute
that
is
within
its
jurisdiction
and
that
imposes
an
obligation
that
is
within
this
court's
provenance
to
enforce,
that
is,
that
it
determines
the
rights
attributable...
enforceable
within
a
court
of
justice,
this
court
would
be
enforcing
the
obligation
to
comply.
it
wouldn't...
the
fact
that
it
diverged
from
the
court's
own
interpretation,
for
example,
here
in
sanchez-llamas,
is
not
relevant
to
the
treaty
obligation
that
this
court
is
exercising--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--because
in
that
situation
that
may
be
beyond
the
court's...
the
executive
power
of
the
court.
what
the
court
would
be
doing
is
determining
the
rights
attributable
to--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the...
the
question
here
is
that
the...
the
court
would
be
exercising
its
judicial
authority
to
construe
the
united
states's
obligation
to
comply
with
the
judgment.
the
nature
of
that
obligation,
itself,
could
be
one
that
would
be
enforceable,
in
this
court's
words,
"in
a
court
of
justice";
and
that's
the
nature
of
this
obligation.
mr.
medellin
gets
a
review
and
reconsideration.
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
that
may
well
be
an
obligation
that
would
be
enforceable
by
other
actors
that
would...
which
would
not
be
directly
enforceable
in
a
court
as
here.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
it
depends
on
the
nature
of--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if
there
were...
if
an
icj--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
right
and--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if
there--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--there
is
surely
because
it's
this
court
that
would
be
enforcing
the
obligation
to
comply.
and
just
as
a
treaty
cannot
contravene
an--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--there
are...
there
are
two
different
obligations
here:
there
is
an
obligation
under
the
vienna
convention
itself,
and
this
court
has
determined
the
dispositive
effect
of
that
obligation
of
a
matter
of
u.s.
law.
but
there's
a
different
obligation.
the
president
and
the
senate
agree
to
go
to
a
third
party,
to
go
to
the
international
court
of
justice,
to
resolve
disputes.
the
very
premise
of
that
obligation
is
that
we
might
disagree
with
the
determination...
with
the
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
and
we
agreed
in
that
circumstance
to
comply
with
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it...
that
would...
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
duty
and
obligation
to
comply,
to
enforce
a
treaty
that
the...
that
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
president's
determination...
what
the
president
has
determined
here
is
to
enforce
the
treaty.
he--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--oh,
if
the
president
here...
the...
if
there's
an
obligation
here
to
comply
and,
in
the
words
this
court,
it's
"an
obligation
of
a
nature
to
be
enforced
in
a
court
of
justice.
"
and
here
the
obligation
imposed
by
the
icj
and
the
avena
judgment
is
an...
is
an
obligation--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--which
essentially--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
would
be...
that...
that's
exactly
right.
what
the...
what
the
icj...
what
u.s.
did
is
undertake
to
comply.
so
the
question
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
obligation
imposed?
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
it
might
have
obligations--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
exactly
the
effect
of
the
judgment.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
it's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
if
the...
whether
or
not
the
treaty
obligation
is
self-executing
or
self-enforcing
goes
to
the
nature
of
the
obligation.
if
the
icj
said...
if
a
treaty
or
an
icj
judgment
said,
go
pass
a
statute,
that's
obviously
directed
to
congress.
if
it
said
cease
hostilities,
that's
directed
to
the
president.
but
as
this
court
has
said,
when
a
treaty
or,
by
extension,
a
treaty
obligation
to
comply
with
a
judgment
is--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--of
a
nature
to
be
enforced--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
in
that
situation,
if
it
was
a
judgment
rendered
in
a
case
to
which
we
had--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that
would
be--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--in
the
first
instance,
yes,
the
court
would
honor
that
judgment
as
an
obligation
to
comply.
but
remember
that
there
are--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--some
constraints
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that
would
depend
on
the...
if...
how
you
construed
the
obligation
to
comply.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
in
this
case,
we
have--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if
that
was
the
nature
of
the
dispute
that
the
united...
that
is,
of
course,
not
the
nature
of
the
dispute
that
the
united
states--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
if
he--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
question
is,
is
it
binding
in
the
first
instance
because
the...
there's
an
obligation
to
comply?
that
doesn't
say
anything
about,
for
example,
congress's
ability
to
repudiate
that
obligation
to
comply,
just
like
it
has
the
obligation...
the
authority
as
a
last-in-time
rule,
pursuant
to
the
last-in-time
rule,
to
repudiate
any
treaty
obligation.
but
the
framers
wanted
treaties
to
be
enforced
in
the
first
instance
when
they
were
susceptible
of
judicial
enforcement,
and
if
the
icj
renders
a
judgment
pursuant
to
our
treaty
obligation
to
submit
disputes,
that
is
of
a
nature
to
be
judicially
enforced,
then
the
court--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--would
be
exercising--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--you
would
enforce
an
icj
judgment
that
did
in
fact...
that
was
of
a
nature
to
be
enforced
in...
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
if
the...
both
the
president's
determination
and
the
article
94
obligation
which
result
in
the
avena
judgment
are
federal
law.
the
president's
determination
pursuant
to
his
state
court
authority
and
article
ii
authority
and
the...
and
the
avena
judgment
pursuant
to
the
treaty--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
court
has...
when
there's
a
federal
procedural
rule
that
preempts
a
state
procedural
rule,
the
court
allows
that
to
preempt
as
a
federal
rule
all
the
time.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
a
function
of--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
federal
government
can
prescribe
rules
of
decision
that
preempt
federal
rules
and
require
the
cases
that
other...
that
would
not
otherwise
be
heard
to
be
heard.
that's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
correct.
that's
right.
it
removes
a
bar
by
preempting
that
bar.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
if
i
may--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
avena
decision--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
avena
decision
has
the
force
of
federal
law,
either
by
virture
of
the
treaty
obligation
to
comply
with
it
under
article
94-1,
or
the
president's
determination
under
his
article
ii
authority
to
require...
to
determine
that
the
united
states
should
comply.
and
by
either
one
of
those
vehicles,
in
effect
the
judgment
becomes
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
instrument
by
which
it
must
be
complied
with.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
that's
right.
it's
the
combined
force
of
the
optional
protocol
and
the
un
charter
and
icj
statute.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
relevant
federal
law
here
is
the
federal
law
that
says
that
the
united
states
will
comply
pursuant
to
its
voluntary
choice
to
submit
these...
this--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--i'm
sorry...
to
the
icj.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
you
are
in
effect
applying
federal
law
in
the
form
of
the
obligation
to
comply.
that's
different
than
applying
the
vienna
convention--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
operative...
it's
different
because
on
the
one
hand,
in
sanchez-llamas,
this
court
was
interpreting
the
underlying
obligation
under
the
treaty.
that
is,
the
immediately
applicable
instrument.
but,
as
with
respect
to
any
judgment,
a
court's...
and
this
court
has
affirmed
with
respect
to
international
adjudications,
that
it
will
enforce
an
international
adjudication.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
wel,
in
this
case,
the
court
would
be...
a
court
applying
the
avena
judgment
either
by
virtue
of
the
optional
protocol
in
94-1
and
the
president's
determination
would
be
in
effect
applying
federal
law.
we
think
the
judgments--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
to
the
extent
necessary
to
apply
federal
law
in
the
form
of
a
judgment--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
president
would
not
displace
the
court's
authority
to
interpret
a
judgment,
no.
what
the
president
has
said
is
that
the
judgment
shall
be
enforced.
that's
an
independent
source
of
federal
law
under
his
article
ii--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--this
court...
to
the
extent
that
this
is
federal
law,
this
court
has
the
ultimate
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
be
complied
with.
and
this
court...
the
framers
have
made
treaties
supreme
federal
law
specification
so
they
could
be
judicially
enforceable.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
you
have
two
separate
and
independent
sources
of
authority
here.
without
the
president's
determination,
this
court
pursuant
to
the
mandate
in
the
supremacy
clause
would
apply
the
treaty
obligation
to
comply
with
the
judgment
because
the
nature
of
the
judgment
is
such
to
be
enforced
in
a
court
of
justice.
in
this
instance,
you
have
an
entirely
independent
source
of
authority
because
the
president
in
the
exercise
of
his
article
ii
authority
has
determined
that
it's
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
to
comply.
that
becomes
a
second
object.
of
course,
it
would
be
a
judicial
function
to
interpret
the...
interpret
those
obligations,
interpret
what
the
president
meant.
but
in
this
case
it's
crystal
clear.
the
avena
judgment
is
mandatory
and
prospective.
the
president
is
determined
that
it
be
enforced,
and
that
would
be
the
result
even
had
the
president
not
acted
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
supremacy
clause,
which
makes
treatise
enforceable
federal
law.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
there
is
nothing
in
the
ratification
history
that
suggests
that
avena
made
any
assumptions
about
whether
or
not
the
optional
protocol
would
be
self-executing.
the
connally
amendment
went
to
the
compulsory
jurisdiction
of
the
icj,
and
the
discussion
to
which
texas
has
referred
is
entirely
about
the
international
ramifications.
in
fact,
the
senate
specifically
declined
to
apply
the
connally
amendment
to
the
optional
protocol.
so
that
gets
to
the
question
that
we
have
been
discussing
here,
which
is:
what
is
the
scope
of
the
enforceability
of
an
icj
judgment?
there
are
obviously
constraints
to
that.
one
is
illustrated
by
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
that
is,
there
are
affirmative
constraints
in
the
constitution,
itself.
the
second
is
illustrated
by
a
point
i
made,
but
mr.
cruz
misunderstood,
which
is
that
the
nature
of
the
obligation
emanating
from
the
judgment
is
directed
at
a
constitutional
branch
such
as
the
obligation
to
enforce
an
active
statute.
obviously,
that
is
not
enforceable
in
court.
if
the
nature
of
the
obligation
is
to
cease
hostilities,
that
is
obviously
directed
to
the
president
and
is
not
enforceable
in
court.
and
that's
illustrated
by
the
nicaragua
case
in
which
the
icj
issued
a
judgment.
congress
passed
a
statute
that
said
it
wasn't
going
to
comply;
and
the
president
said
he
wasn't
going
to
comply.
that,
in
turn,
applies
to
the
third
constraint,
which
is
the
political
constraint,
itself.
the
nicaragua
case
illustrates
that
if
the
icj
issues
a
judgment
that
the
united
states
does
not
want
to
comply
with,
congress
can
pass
a
statute
to
say
we
repudiate
the
obligation.
so
the
obligations
that
we
are
talking
about
here
in
which
the
icj
judgment
would
be
enforceable
by
an
individual
fall
squarely
in
the
class
of
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
for
two
centuries
where
an
individual
has
a
right
conferred
by
the
statute.
and
he
walked
into
a
court,
and
he
asked
that
court
to
enforce
that
right,
and
he
invokes
that
right
in...
as
in
the
caffa
core
case,
the
roucher
case,
cases
going
back
to
the
founding.
and
this
court
has
said
when
the
right
is
of
a
nature
to
be
enforced
in
a
court
of
justice,
this
court
will
enforce
it.
and
that
is
all
mr.
medellin
is
asserting
here:
the
right
to
enforce
a
right
that
is
eminently
suitable
for
judicial
enforcement
because
it
goes
to
the
judicial
process,
itself.
the
second
point
with
respect
to
article
iii:
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
this
court
can
never
enforce...
gives
away
its
article
iii
authority
when
somebody
else
enforces
a
judgment.
we
know
from
the
comegys
and
the
abba
cases
that
we
have
cited
that
the
court
has
in
fact
said
that
when
the
u.s.
submits
a
case
to
international
adjudication
that
international
adjudication
is
binding
and
it's
not
reexaminable
in
a
u.s.
court.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
but
that's
because
that
was
not
part
of
what
the
court
had
actually
decided,
or
rather
that
the
international
adjudication
had
actually
decided.
you
think
about,
if
the
proposition
is
that
nobody
else
but
an
article
iii
court
can
decide
a
federal
question,
this
court
could
not
have
decided
mitsubishi.
in
mitsubishi
the
court
sent
federal
statute
antitrust
claims
to
an
arbitration
panel
in
tokyo
and
said
that
the
result
would
be
everyone
forcible
so
long
as
the
panel
actually
took
cognizance
of
the
claim
and
actually
decided
it.
this
court
if
it
evaluated
the
claim
that
mr.
medellin
is
entitled
to
review
and
reconsideration
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
obligation
under
94-1
and
the
president's
determination
that
that
treaty
obligation
will
be
given
effect,
this
court
would
be
performing
a
supremely
judicial
function,
that
is
it
would
be
interpreting
and
applying
federal
law
in
the
form
of
a
statute,
which
is
exactly
what
the
supremacy
clause
requests
the
court
to
do.
with
respect
to--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that
assumes
that
it
is
not
self-executing,
yes.
but
the
whole
question
here
is--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--when
we're
talking
about
self-executing
here
we're
saying
what
branch
is
the
obligation
directed
to.
and
what
the
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
is
when
the
obligation
is
of
a
nature
to
be
enforced
in
a
court
of
justice
it
is
directed
to
the
judicial
authority.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
exactly
right.
the
thing
that
makes
the
treaty
federal
law
is
not
the
court;
it's
the
supremacy
clause,
which
makes
it
supreme
federal
law.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
it's
settled
that
a
treaty
cannot
contravene
an
affirmative
constitutional
obligation.
there
would
be...
if
there
was...
if
the
icj--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--there
are
two
different
treaty
obligations.
there's
a
treaty
obligation
under
the
vienna
convention,
which
this
court
has
now
dispositively
interpreted,
and
there's
a
treaty
obligation
to
comply.
and
it's
the
very
nature
of
an
obligation
to
put
a
dispute
to
a
third
party
that
you
may
not
agree
with
the
result,
and
that
does
not
in
any
way
compromise
this
court's
article
iii
authority
to
rest
that
judgment
on
an
obligation
committed
to
by
the
political
branches,
three
treaties
ratified
by
the
president
and
senate
that
said
when
this
country
commits
itself
to
do
something
we're
going
to
do
it.
now
we
have
the
president
of
the
united
states
saying
that
it's
in
the
paramount
interests
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
enforcing--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
courts
in
enforcing
that
judgment
would.
of
course
that
would
be
part
of
the
judicial
enterprise.
the
applicable
instrument
is
now
the
avena
judgment,
pursuant
to
the
treaties
and
the
president's
determination,
independent
sources.
in
applying
that
judgment,
there
may
well
be
interpretive
questions
because
the
avena
judgment
lays
down
standards
and
requires
obligations
and
that
would
be
part
of
the
judicial
enterprise.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
right,
because
that's
the
very
nature
of
enforcing
a
judgment:
you
do
not
re-examine
the
merits.
you
take
the
judgment
and
you
enforce
the
judgment.
and
it's
the
judicial
enterprise
to
construe
what
that...
it
may
be
a
question
about
construing
that...
what
that
instrument
requires,
what
that
judgment
requires.
but
it's
the
judicial
function
in
enforcing
that
judgment
that
calls
upon
this
article...
the
court's
article
iii
authority,
and
does
not
in
any
way
compromise
it,
which
in
turn
goes
to
the
question
about
what
the
judgment
itself
requires.
it
requires
prospective
review
and
reconsideration.
the
texas
court
didn't
suggest
that
mr.
medellin
had
received
review
and
reconsideration.
the
icj
made
it
clear
that
it
had
to
be
prospective,
and
one
of
the
fundamental
reasons
for
that
is
because
the
judgment
says
that
the
treaty
rights
has
to
be
determined
on
its
own.
mr.
medellin
is
entitled
to
show
that
the
violation
of
the
treaty
standing
on
its
own
two
feet
and
not
filtered
through
a
constitutional
right
affected...
that
he
is
entitled
to
show
prejudice.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
