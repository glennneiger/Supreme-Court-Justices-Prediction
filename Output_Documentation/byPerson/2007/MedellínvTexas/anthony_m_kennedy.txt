justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
still
interested
in
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
court
acts
beyond,
clearly
beyond,
its
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
answer
the
hypothetical,
please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
in
this
case
the
president
did
the
opposite...
the
same
facts
only
the
president
said
to
texas,
do
not
comply
with
this
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
president's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--determination
is
not
conclusive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
hypothetical
is
he's
coming
out
the
other
way.
he
says
don't
follow
this
judgment.
and
you
say
he
can't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
think
that
that's
not...
not
consistent
with
your
earlier
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
this
court
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
avena
judgment
if
it's
ambiguous?
for
instance,
it
said
that
a
number
of
mexico
nationals
have
not
received
a
hearing.
it
didn't
say
all
of
them.
and
i
have
a
problem,
incidentally,
because
i
think
medellin
did
receive
all
the
hearing
that
he's
entitled
to
under
the
judgment
anyway.
can
we
interpret
the
judgment
in
that
respect
if
it's
ambiguous,
not
clear?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
we
interpret
the
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
can
the
president
displace
our
authority
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
president
had
reached
the
contrary
conclusion,
a
hypothetical
we
put
earlier.
supposed
the
president
had
told
texas,
do
not
follow
this
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
that
we
should
give
that
determination
great
weight,
but
that's
something
quite
different
from
saying
that
he
can
displace
the
authority
of
this
court
on
that
issue
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
nash
he
was
being
held
under
federal
custody.
so
nash
is
just
inapplicable
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
nash
is
just
a
wonderful
speech
by
marshall
anyway;
it's
not
an
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
you
are
saying...
and
this
has
been
the
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--go
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
this
is
consistent
with
what
you've
been
explaining
to
justice
breyer
in
your
answer,
that
for
200
years
we
have
had
some
treaties
that
are
very
important,
but
they're
not
self-executing;
their
violation
may
put
us
in
violation
of
international
law;
but
it
is
for
us
to
determine
how
we
are
going
to
comply
with
the
international
obligation;
and
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
comply
with
that
law
because
it's
not
self-executing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
some
point
i
think
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
we
may
get
back
to
whether
the
vienna
convention
itself
is
or
is
not
self-executing.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
was
correct
in
saying
that
that's
a
difficult
word.
i
think
it
is
self-executing
in
that
the
state
has
to
comply
with
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
self-executing
in
that
the
state
has
to
accept
whatever
procedural
framework
the
foreign
national
demands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
united
states
apparently
accepts
the
verdict
of
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
have
three
different
things
that
you
have
to
tell
us
about
today:
that
the
president's
authority,
the
effect
of
the
icj,
and...
and
the
avena
judgment,
and
ultimately,
the
force
of
the
vienna
convention
itself.
and
the
only
question
i
have
that
i
need
your
help
with
is
as
to
the
last,
and
i
hope
that
it
doesn't
interrupt
the
train
of
your
argument.
i
think
the
icj...
pardon
me,
the
vienna
convention
is
self-executing,
in
that
it
requires
the
states
to
conform
to
the
consular
notification
provision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
have
a
judge
who
has
control
over
a
defendant
who's
being
held
in
custody
pending
trial,
and
the
defendant
says
i
want
to
see
my...
my
foreign
counsel.
the
judge
says
no.
can
you
mandate
that...
assuming
state
procedures
allow
him
in,
couldn't
you
mandate
that
judge
to
require
him
to
allow
the
notification
to
take
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
see
where
i'm
going?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
thought
he
did,
would
i
still
have
to
rule
against
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
i
make
a
distinction
between
failing
to
let
him
see
the
counsel
at
all
in
my
hypothetical
and
a
demand
that
the
procedural
framework
be
altered?
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
those
two
cases,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
many
parties
to
avena...
there
were
51...
are
being
held
in
the
state
of
texas?
