justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're...
you're...
as
i
understand
it,
in
order
for
you
to
prevail
on
that
point,
the
only...
the
only
conclusion
that
has
to
be
drawn,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
texas
courts
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
this
kind
of...
of
order,
and
that
the
bar
that
texas
is
asserting
is
simply,
in
effect,
a
procedural
bar;
and,
therefore,
in
order
for
this
federal
rule
to
preempt
the
state
bar
is
not
to
give
the
state
courts
jurisdiction
they
don't
have,
but
to
remove
a
bar
to
the
exercise
of
their
jurisdiction
that
state
law,
absent
preemption,
would
impose;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
a
further...
may
i
ask
a
further
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
try
one
other
variation
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
argument.
what
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
said
this
judgment,
the
avena
judgment,
will
not
be
enforced,
and
this
court
interpreted
the
avena
judgment
as
binding,
as
providing
a
rule
of
decision
and
a
rule
of
decision
which
was
entitled
to
respect
by
texas?
would
this
court's
authority
to
make
that
declaration
and
issue
a
judgment
to
that
effect
be
displaced
by
the
president's
determination
that
it
would
not
be
that
the
avena
judgment
would
not
be
enforced?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it
does
follow
then
from
what
you've
said
that
if
we
take
exactly
the
position
that
i
outlined
in
my
hypo,
we
could
avoid
the
entire
question
of
presidential
authority.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
in
effect
a
judicial
version
of
one
of
the
variants
in
justice
jackson's
hypo
in
the
steel
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he's
talking
about
the
president
and
congress;
we're
talking
about
the
president
and
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
the...
that's
the
argument,
but
your
brother
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
that
if
we
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
there
is
a...
a
rule
of
decision
that
should
be
respected
in
this
court
and,
hence,
the
subject
of
a
judgment
to
texas
that,
among
other
things,
would
suspend
texas's
procedural
bar
law...
that
that
would
obviate
the
question
of
presidential
power.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
cruz,
you
have
frequently
emphasized
the
non-self-executing
character
of
the
optional
protocol.
is
there
any
rule,
any
positive
rule
in
existence
today
either
of
international
law
or
domestic
law
that
precludes
this
court
from
being
the
implementing
authority
as
opposed
to
the
executive
or
the
executive
and
the
senate?
justice
david
h.
souter
these
treaties
including
the
optional
protocol.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
the
rule...
what
is
the
positive
rule
of
international
and
domestic
law
that
precludes
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
they've
made
the
treaty.
we
have
got
the
optional
protocol.
whatever
the
optional
protocol
means
is
federal
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
my
point
is,
my...
i'm
accepting
as
premise
of
the
question
the
limitation
which
you
assert,
i.e.,
non-self-executing;
and
my
question
is,
may
the
execution,
if
you
will,
be
made
by
this
court?
is
there
an
independent
rule
that
precludes
this
court
from
that
role?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
mean
to
be
disrespectful
of
your
judgment
but
what
do
you
base
it
on...
tradition?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
by...
by
non-self-executing,
they
mean
you
have
to
come
back
to
us?
the
terms--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
what
you
are
saying
if
i
understand
you
is
that
justice
scalia
was
wrong
when
he
said
that
would
be
making
it
federal
law.
i
think
you
were
saying
that
would
be
a...
the
branch
that
was
responsible
for
determining
how
to
execute,
i.e.,
to
apply,
federal
law.
is
that
your
point?
