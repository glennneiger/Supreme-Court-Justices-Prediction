mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
i
do
agree
with
that
and
there's
a
couple
of
the
issues
here
where
we
take
a
slightly
different
take.
obviously
we
feel
the
president's
determination
here
that
we
will
comply
with
the
avena
judgment
is
a
critical
element
in
why
there's
an
enforceable
obligation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
now,
obviously,
mr.
donovan
and
his
clients
could
get
here
and
ask
you
to
enforce
the
judgment
of
it
own
force
without
the
president's
determination
and
that
would
ultimately
be
a
question
for
this
court.
we
of
course--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
hope
that
you
wouldn't
and
we
would
be
up
here
saying
don't,
because
if
you
look
at
article
94
of
the
un
charter
as
a
whole,
it
has
two
components
and
i
think
it
makes
clear
why
the
president's
intervening
role
here
is
important.
94-1
says
that
we
undertake
to
comply
with
our
obligations,
with
our
obligations
to
comply
with
the
judgment.
but
94-2
says
what
happens
when
a
country
doesn't
do
that.
it's
a
matter
for
the
security
council.
and
that,
of
course,
i
think
necessarily
implies
that
countries
do
retain
the
option
to
put
themselves
out
of
compliance
with
an
international
court
of
justice
judgment.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
and
that's
why
we're
supporting
mr.
donovan.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
whether
it's
an
omission
or
a
commission
i
don't
think
is
the
point,
justice
scalia.
my
point--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
didn't
take
that
to
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree,
i
think
the
omission-commission--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
take
that
in
turn.
let
me
just
first
close
the
discussion
of
what
happened
here
by
saying
the
reason
i
think
the
commission-omission
distinction
doesn't
have
much
purchase
here
is
because
the
president
did
make
a
determination
that
we
would
comply.
and
i
think
if
you
ask
the
question
who
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
we're
going
to
default
on
our
international
law
obligations
or
comply,
especially
vis-a-vis
the
un,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
quite
clear:
it's
the
president,
and
congress
has
acquiesced
in
that
with
the
un
participation
act
at
22
u.s.c.
287.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
depends
exactly
what
form
that
would
take.
i
think
part
of
the
problem...
i'm
stumbling
with
that
question--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
what
does
it
suggest
that
is
supposed
to
be
done
with
the
end
product
of
that
determination?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
that
it
wouldn't...
i
would
say
that
it
wouldn't,
as
you
suggest,
not
fully
comply
and
not
fully
discharge
with
our
obligation.
but
the
extent
to
which
we
did
and
purported
to
be
doing
that
under
compliance
with
the
judgment,
it
would
have
the
same
force
as
providing
the
rule
of
decision,
which,
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
especially
in
a
context
like
this,
is
not
so
unprecedented.
it
is
not
materially
different
from
when
the
president
supplies
the
rule
of
decision
in
the
pre
fsia
practice
by
making
a
determination,
binding
on
the
courts
state
and
federal,
that
somebody
has
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
alito,
i
don't
think
the
theory
would
sweep
that
broadly,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
first
of
all,
there's
obviously
a
limiting
principle
in
our
theory,
which
is
to
say
that
the
president
can't
take
any
action
pursuant
to
this
which
is
inconsistent
with
other
constitutional
obligations.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
exactly
right
as
to
the
vienna
convention.
but
this
case
raises
a
question,
not
about
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
vienna
convention,
because
as
you
remember
we
were
four-square
with
this
court
on
its
interpretation
of
the
vienna
convention
in
sanchez-llamas.
the
relevant
treaties
here
the
optional
protocol
and
the
un
charter,
and
the
question
here
is
not
the
force
of...
of
the
avena
judgment
as
precedent--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no
doubt
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
think
with
respect
to
anyone
but
the
51
individuals
that
are
covered
by
the
judgment
that
of
course
this
court
has
the
final
word
on
the
interpretation
of
the
vienna
convention.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
course
the
countries
were
parties,
but
these
51
individuals'
claims
were
specifically
adjudicated.
why
were
they
specifically
adjudicated?
because
they
were
effectively...
the
claims
were
espoused
by
the
mexican
government.
that
system--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
reflects
that
self-executing
is
one
of
those
words
that
people
use
to
cover
a
lot
of
different
meanings;
and
i
think
in
its
most
correct
sense,
you're
right
to
say
that
the
vienna
convention
is
self-executing.
so
there
didn't
have
to
be
legislation
before
texas
and
its
local
officials
were
obligated
to
provide
notice
in
this
case;
and
of
course,
it's
their
default
on
that
treat
obligation
by
the
state
and
local
officials
that
has
us
in
this
predicament
in
the
first
place.
now,
there's
another
meaning
of
"self-executing",
or
maybe
it's
a
misuse
of
the
term,
to
say
whether
it
gives
rise
to
individually
enforceable
rights
in
court
without
more.
and
we
do
take
the
position
that
if
the
president
had
done
nothing,
and
certainly
if
the
president
had
said
we're
not
going
to
comply,
we're
going
to
respond
to
this
icj
judgment
the
way
we
did
with
the
nicaragua
judgment,
we
don't
think
that
this
judgment
would
be
enforceable
as
of
its
own
terms.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
absolutely
right,
and
that
gets
back
to
the
basic
principle
of
reviewing
foreign
judgments;
and
it's
not
that
this
court
is
disabled
from
its
judicial
role.
it's
just
the
judicial
role
here
is
not
a
straight-up
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
vienna
convention.
it's
a
question
of
what
effect
to
give
the
judgment
that's
been
effectively
validated
by
the
executive
branch.
and
there's
two
things--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's...
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
as
justice
ginsburg
put
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
right,
and
certainly
our
obligation
under
that
judgment
as
the
executive
branch
sees
it
is
to
these
51
individuals
as
their
claims
have
been
espoused
by--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--then
i'd
be
on
that
side
of
the
podium,
your
honor.
i
mean,
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
president's
authority
here
is,
in
his
view
of
this,
is
a
necessary
step;
and
that
seems
to
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
but
the...
the
president
can't
displace
the
role
of
this
court.
it's
just
that
the
role
of
this
court
in
a
situation
where
there's
been
a
judgment
and
the
executive
branch
has
viewed
that
judgment
as
something
we
should
comply
with,
then
the
role
of
this
court
is
limited
to
deciding
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
to
issue
that
judgment
in
the
first
place;
and
then
the
secondary
role
of
this
court
would
to
be
to
say,
does
the
rule
of
law
embodied
by
that
judgment
violate
the
constitution.
and
that's
why
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
original
hypothetical,
about
a
sentence
to
5
years
for
guards
that
had
no
notice...
that's
a
different
case.
but
here
there's
no
colorable
argument
that
the...
that
the
judgment
here
and
what's
embodied
in
it
lies
outside
the
power
of
the
federal
government
as
a
whole
to
adjudicate
and
to
put
as
an
obligation
on
the
states.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
of
course
not,
justice
souter.
that
would
just
be
like
cases
that
unfortunately
happen,
where
we
would
take
a
position
that
the
judgment
on
its
own
is
not
binding
and
you
would
reject
that
position
and
that
would
be
the
law
of
the
land.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
don't
suggest
that
we
wouldn't
comply
with
a
judgment
of
this
court,
accepting
mr.
donovan's
first
theory
that
the
president's
role
here
is
unimportant.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
we
do
think,
we
stick
to
our
view
that
the
president's
role
here
makes
this
an
easier
case
and
is
in
our
view
dispositive.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
could.
i
think
another
route,
of
course,
that
would
be
available
to
you
is
to
simply
say:
here
we
have
a
judgment
and
we
have
the
president
effectively
espousing
the
judgment,
and
in
those
cases
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
what
would
happen
if
we
didn't
have
one
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
there's
two
questions
there.
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
them
both.
one
is,
what
degree
of
formality
is
required?
and
we
would
say
that
if
you
look
to
historical
practice,
this
is
not
something
where
you
a
need
a
high
degree
of
formality.
so
look
to
the
executive
agreement
that
this
case...
this
court
gave
its
positive
effect
to
in
belmont
and
pink.
it
was
an
exchange
of
diplomatic
letters,
nothing
more.
look
to
the
executive
determination
that
this
court
give
dispositive
effect
to,
dismissed
the
lawsuit
completely
in
ex
parte
peru.
it
was
a
letter
from
the
undersecretary
of
state
to
the
attorney
general.
going
back
to
the
very
beginnings
of
the
nation,
look
at
the
extradition
of
thomas
nash.
what
was
the
form
of
the
president's
determination
we
would
extradite
him?
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
state
to
judge
bee
in
south
carolina.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
with
respect--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
don't
think
nash
is
inapplicable,
justice
kennedy;
i
think
it
is
on
all
fours.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but
it
is
a
wonderful
speech,
and
i
really
do
think
you
should
take
a
look
at
that
speech.
if
you
want
to
find
it,
it's
actually
appended
to
volume
18
of
the
u.s.
reports.
and
i
think
you
should
look
at
that
speech
before
rejecting
our
position
here,
because
it
really
is
on
all
fours
in
that
there
you
had
a
treaty
obligation
duly
approved
by
the
senate,
and
there
was
a
question:
do
we
need
an
act
of
congress
before
the
executive
can
extradite
somebody?
and
marshall
i
think
put
the
law
exactly
right
in
that
case
when
he
said:
sure,
congress
can
make
a
determination
and
if
it
does,
that's
the
end
of
matter;
but
absent
the
congressional
determination,
the
president
has
the
authority
to
extradite
nash.
now,
that's
a
situation
where
somebody's
personal
liberty
was
at
stake.
so
i
would
say
that
in
some
respects
it's
a
fortiori
that
in
this
case
what's
at
issue
is
simply
recognizing
that
there's
binding
federal
law
here,
that
i
think
if
the
texas
court
had
recognized
that
it
was
binding
federal
law,
it
would
have
applied
under
their
own
state
procedural
default
law.
now,
just
to
finish
up,
and
then
i
will
sit
down,
there's
a
second
part
of
your
question,
justice
scalia,
which
was
addressed
to
what
does
the
reference
to
comity
mean.
obviously,
from
the
very
beginning
in
this
case
we
have
taken
the
position
in
this
court
that
the
president's
memorandum
directs
the
state
courts,
in
its
words,
to
give
effect
to
the
avena
judgment...
not
decide
whether
you
want
to
give
it
effect
based
on
your
state
law
of
comity,
but
give
effect
to
the
judgment.
i
think
if
you
actually
look
at
the
law
of
comity,
one
of
the
things
that
it
talks
about
is
comity
is
really
what
the
courts
should
do
in
the
absence
of
a
controlling
view
from
one
of
the
political
branches.
here
the
president
has
made
clear,
it's
clear
to
me
what
the
answer
is
applying
comity,
which
would
be
to
give
effect
to
the
judgment.
thank
you.
