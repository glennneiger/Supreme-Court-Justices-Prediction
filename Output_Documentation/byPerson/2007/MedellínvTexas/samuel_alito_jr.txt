isn't
the
obligation--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
the
obligation
that
the
united
states
undertook
when
it
signed
the
un
charter
the
obligation
to
undertake
to
comply
with
icj
judgments
in
accordance
with
its
own
constitutional
processes,
not
necessarily
that
any
icj
decision
would
be
regarded
by
any
court
in
this
country
as
binding
federal
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
they
say--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--he
goes
to
jail
for
no
time
at
all?
they
say
that
the
remedy
for
these
violations,
in
order
to
deter
future
violations,
should
be
that
the
charges
should
be
dismissed
and
any
future
prosecution
should
be
barred.
would
that
be
automatically
binding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

you
just--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
just
said
that
the
avena
decision
is
federal
law.
how
is
the...
how
is
the
avena
decision
itself
a
federal
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
a
statute.
it's
not
the
constitution.
it's
not
itself
a
treaty.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
agree
with
you,
would
the
effect
be
that
the
president
can
take
any
treaty
that
is
ratified
on
the
understanding
that
it's
not
self-executing
and
execute
the
treaty
and
give
it
force
under
domestic
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
it
not?
