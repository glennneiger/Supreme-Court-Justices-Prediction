chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
no.
06-1321,
gomez-perez
v.
potter.
mr.
guerra.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
not.
i
mean,
a
company
could
have
a
policy
of
firing
everybody
who
complains
about
anything
and
the
fact
that
a
worker
is
over
the
age
of
40
and
is
fired
does
not
mean
that
he
is
being
fired
because
of
age.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course
the
statute
that
covers
age
discrimination
in
the
private
sector
does
have
an
express
provision
addressing
retaliation.
the
one
that
governs
federal
employees
does
not,
and
that's
the
government's
main
argument,
that
it's
expressed
in
the
private
sector,
it's
not
there
in
the
public
sector
and
so
you
shouldn't
imply
one.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
federal
employee,
though,
has
all
of
the
remedies
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
for
any
type
of
employment
practice.
those
remedies
are
elaborately
reticulated
and
almost
impenetrable,
and
yet
this
would
add
complication.
in
other
words,
despite
all
the
remedies
under
the
csra
that
says
in
some
cases
you
go
here,
in
other
cases
you
go
here,
and
you
get
different
types
of
review
depending
on
the
facts,
all
of
that
would
be
wiped
away
if
you
can
bring
a
direct
action
under
the
age
discrimination
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
retaliation
claims.
in
other
words,
although
the
direct
claims,
as
you
put
it,
may
or
may
not
be
carved
out,
a
retaliation
claim
fits
under
the
employment
practices
provisions
of
the
csra,
regardless
of
the
basis
for
retaliation.
in
other
words,
you
took
personnel
action
against
me
for
an
impermissible
basis
and
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
the
various
civil
service
remedies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
does
that
for
a
reason.
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
in
the
federal
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
that
addresses
a
lot
of
these
problems
say
that
when
the
csra
excludes
certain
types
of
claims
of
employees,
they
do
it
for
a
reason.
in
other
words,
it's
not
simply
that
they
didn't
cover
them
or
inadvertence,
but
they
make
the
decision
that
the
remedies
that
they've
provided
don't
apply
in
a
particular
case.
and
to
say
that
those
people
who
are
excluded
under
the
csra
nonetheless
have
remedies
for
employment
practices
seems
to
me
to
undermine
that...
that
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
qualified
your
answer
by
saying
that
the
employee
can
control,
was
that
a
way
to
dismiss
the
collective
bargaining
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
review
under...
by
the
merit
systems
protection
board?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
you're
talking
about
the
office
of
special
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
another
reason
it's
not
that
simple
is
that
under
the
age
discrimination
act
you
have
a
private
remedy
that
specifically
provides
for
retaliation.
and
that
is
noticeably
absent
from
the
federal
remedy.
and
i
thought
that
was
the
strongest
argument
on
the
government's
side.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
there
was
a
more
express
incorporation
in
title
vii
of
the
private
anti
retaliation
remedy,
and
you
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
makes
it
not
precisely
the
same
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
this
employee
has
no
remedy
under
the
civil
service
reform
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
i
mean,
if
you
have
the
private...
the
private
sector
remedy
is
not
so
limited,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
imply
or
incorporate
into
the
federal
anti
discrimination
remedy
an
anti
retaliation
provision,
i
assume
it
would
be
in
the
same
scope
as
the
private
anti...
the
private
antiretaliation
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
this
an
unusual
retaliation
case
in
that
the
person
allegedly
retaliated
against
also
has
substantive
anti
discrimination
claims?
and
i
gather...
i
think
it
would
take
a
particularly
incompetent
lawyer
that
couldn't
phrase
retaliation
in
those
cases
as
underlying
discrimination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
those,
are
those
mostly
witness
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
it's
a
witness
saying
i
think
so
and
so
was
fired
because
of
his
age.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
does
bring
up
justice
alito's
point.
i
mean,
tomorrow
you're
going
to
argue
the
exact
opposite,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
else
that
distinction
between
conduct
and
status
would
require
you
to
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
would
have
thought
the
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
would
be:
this
is
an
unusual
situation
where
you
have
the
employer
writing
the
law
about
what
the
employees
can
do,
and
congress
realized,
perhaps
unlike
the
situation
in
title
vii,
everybody
over
40
would
be
covered;
and
every
time
somebody
over
40
was
fired
or
disciplined
or
didn't
get
a
raise,
they
could
claim
that
it
was
age
discrimination;
and
congress
decided
that
they
as
the
employer
didn't
want
to
face
that
disturbance,
particularly
since
they
have
the
civil
service
reform
act
already.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
guerra,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
because
they
may
not
engage
in
collective
bargaining,
or
because
they
have
chosen
not
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
that's
consistent
with
whatever
prohibition
it
is
that
precludes
them
from
engaging
in
collective
bargaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
we
do
have
to
decide
the
title
vii
question
if
you
are
to
prevail.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
