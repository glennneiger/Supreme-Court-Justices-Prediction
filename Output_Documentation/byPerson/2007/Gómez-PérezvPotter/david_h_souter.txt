justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
cover
your
client?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it's
ineffective
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
it's
ineffective
here
and
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
the
only
way
to
cure
the
ineffectiveness
is
with
a
separate
provision
and
you
don't
have
a
separate
provision,
you're
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
garre
isn't
the
most
that
argument
gets
you
that
the
only
individuals
who
could
complain
against
retaliation
are
those
over
40?
it
doesn't
get
you
out...
it
doesn't
get
you
where
you
want
to
go.
it's
not
retaliation
right
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
any
more
anomalous
than
the
fact
that
the
only
protection
of
the
age
protection
is
simply
for
people
over
40?
in
other
words,
congress
didn't
care
whether
there
are
employers
in
the
world
who
don't
like
youthful
people.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
just
worried
about
the
age.
so
if
it's
an
anomaly
it's
an
anomaly
across
the
board
in
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
would
it
have
thought
that?
in
other
words,
if...
i
can
understand
why
you
say...
if
you're
going
to
put
a
rational
gloss
on
it,
that
must
be
what
they
were
thinking,
but
why
would
they
think
such
a
thing?
