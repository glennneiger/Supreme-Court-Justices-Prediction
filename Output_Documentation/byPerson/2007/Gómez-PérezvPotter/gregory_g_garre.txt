mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
does
not
expressly
prohibit
retaliation
in
the
federal
sector
context
and
it
should
not
be
read
to
impliedly
prohibits
such
conduct
either.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
did
so
very,
very
focused
on
title
ix,
the
court's
cases
interpreting
the
language
of
discrimination
in
title
ix
broadly.
and
it
specifically
distinguished
statutes
like
title
vii
and
the
age
discrimination
act
which
delineate
different
types
of
discrimination.
in
fact,
on
page
175
of
the
court's
decision
in
jackson,
the
court
said
because
congress
did
not
list
any
specific
discriminatory
practices
when
it
wrote
title
ix,
its
failure
to
mention
one
such
practice
does
not
tell
us
anything.
and
then
it
pointed
to
the
fact
that
title
vii
had
delineated
certain
types
of
practices.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
that
would
be
unfair,
justice
alito.
the
government's
position
is
that
statutory
context
matters.
it
made
that
clear
in
footnote
1
of
its
jackson
brief
before
this
court.
it's
made
it
clear
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
are
several
indicia
of
statutory
intent
that
are
lacking
where
you
have
a
general
prohibition
in
the
context
of
the
inferred
right
that
has...
that
this
court
has
treated
differently,
as
it
did
in
jackson
and
as
it
should
in
the
did
in
the
cbocs
case
that
you'll
hear
about
tomorrow.
in
the
age
discrimination
act
you
have
separate
provisions
of
the
act
which
explicitly
delineate
different
types
of
discrimination,
including
retaliatory
discrimination,
and
in
the
federal
sector
prohibition
the
congress
added
in
1974,
it
added
that
at
a
time
where
it
decided
to
treat
state
employers
like
federal
employers,
specifically
put
the
state
employers
in
the
definition
of
employer
for
the
federal...
for
the
private
sector
provision
of
the
age
discrimination
act,
and
it
created
a
stand
alone
provision
for
federal
employers.
and
then
it
went
even
further.
it
specifically
said
in
subsection
(f)
of
section
633a,
the
federal
sector
provision,
that
the
federal
sector
provision
should
be
unaffected
by
the
private
sector
provision,
the
bootstrap
to
make
clear
that
courts
should
not
be
reading
into
the
federal
sector
provision
the
additional
protections
or
other
provisions
in
the
private
sector
provisions.
and
this
court
recognized
the
significance
of
that
construction,
that
statutory
scheme
in
the
lehman
v.
nakshian
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
considered
whether
federal
employees
were
entitled
to
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
an
action
for
discrimination
under
the
federal
sector
prohibition.
private
sector
employees
were
entitled
to
that.
and
so
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
made
an
argument
very
much
similar
to
the
argument
made
by
petitioners
in
this
case:
well,
the
private
sector
provisions
covered
a
jury
trial
right;
it
would
make
no
sense
not
to
have
a
jury
trial--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
let
me
try
to
answer
that
question,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
just
want
to
make
one
final
point
on
lehman
and
the
statutory
construction
in
that
case.
the
court
specifically
said
on
page
162
of
its
decision
that
because
congress
demonstrated
that
it
knew
how
to
provide
a
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
when
it
wished
to
do
so
elsewhere
in
the
very
legislation
cited,
but
in
section
633a
it
explicitly
failed
to
do
so,
and
it
said
that
that
was
the
conclusive
point
of
statutory
construction
in
that
case.
so
we
do
think
the
lehman
case
is
very
on
point
here.
with
respect
to
the
general
notion
that
it's
uncommon
to
provide...
not
to
provide
an
anti
retaliation
right
when
you
do
have
an
underlying
anti
discrimination
prohibition,
certainly
we
would
agree
with
you
that
it
is
uncommon,
but
we
don't
think
that
it
is
absurd.
it's
certainly
not
absurd
where
congress
was
aware
that
there
was
a
separate
set
of
protections
available
for
federal
workers--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
know
that
congress
in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
we
know
that
it
didn't
think
that
additional
anti
retaliation
protections
were
necessary
for
some
federal
employees.
so
the
fact
that
congress
wouldn't
have
a
separate
anti
retaliation...
anti
retaliation
right
in
some
situation
in
itself
is
not
unprecedented.
we
do
think
that
the
statute
has
several
indicia
that
make
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
provide
an
anti
retaliation
right
here.
not
only
the
contrast
between
the
private
sector
and
federal
sector
provisions,
but
look
at
what
congress
expressed
in
section
633a.
in
at
least
three
respects
this
is
materially
unlike
the
typical
anti
retaliation
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
as
we
make
clear
in
our
brief,
we
have
not
conceded
that,
justice
alito.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
courts
to
decide
that
in
this
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
in
practice,
your
honor,
we
have
not
challenged
the
interpretation
of
the
federal
courts
that
have
found
that
title
vii
does
incorporate
an
anti
retaliation
right.
but
there
are
at
least--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
circuit
court
that
has
gone
the
other
way
on
title
vii.
certainly
the
age
discrimination
act
is
different.
the
first
circuit
in
this
case
explicitly
recognized
that
the
textual
differences
between
title
vii
and
the
age
act
call
for
a
different
result.
and
there
are
at
least
two
differences
that
we
do
think
call
for
a
different
result
under
the
age
act.
the
first
is
the
fact
that,
whereas
title
vii
expressly
incorporates
the
private
sector
provisions
of
the
act
and
by
reference
the
anti
retaliation
provision
of
the
act--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
this
court
actually
has
interpreted
that
phrase,
v.
radabush.
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
brief,
but
it
is
directly
responsive
to
that
question.
and
the
cite
there
is
425
u.s.
840.
and
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
the
"as
applicable"
language
just
means
that
there
are
certain
provisions
of
the
private
sector
remedies
that
are
inherently
incompatible
in
the
federal
sector
context.
and
it
pointed
to
the
provisions
in
the
private
sector
part
of
title
vii
that
allowed
eeoc
or
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
the
private
action
and
take
over
the
suit.
so
the
"as
applicable"
doesn't
undermine
the
express
incorporation
of
private
sector
remedies
and
anti
retaliation.
and
that's
a
critical
difference
between
title
vii
and
the
age
act.
the
age
act
not
only
does
not
include
that
express
incorporation,
it
goes
in
just
the
opposite
direction,
and
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
don't
import
the
private
sector
provisions...
it
did
that
in
section
633a(f)...
don't
incorporate
those
provisions,
and
that's
what
this
court
recognized.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
this
court
in
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
legislative
history
on
point.
the
petitioners
argue
that
it
meant
don't
incorporate
the
more
restrictive
features.
but
that
argument
is
directly
contradicted
by
this
court's
decision
in
lehman,
where
it
pointed
to
section,
subsection
(f)
of
that
provision
as
a
reason
to
not
import
in
the
jury
trial
right
that
was
not
recognized
for
private
sector
employees.
the
other
way--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
she
is
a
nonpreference
eligible
employee
of
the
postal
service.
that
means
that
she
has
to
pursue
her
remedies
under
the
collective
bargaining
arrangement,
which
gives
her
a
remedy
to
complain
about
reprisal.
and
it
means
that
the
union
representative
would
present
that
grievance
on
her
behalf.
but
it
also
means
that
if
for
some
reason
she
felt
that
her
right
of...
her
obligation
of
fair
representation
was
not
carried
through,
she
could
go
to
court
and
complain
about
that.
this
court
in
a
case
called
bowen
v.
united
states
postal
service
recognized
that
employees
who
don't
get
fair
representation
can
go
into
court
and
complain
about
that.
so
she
is
protected--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
believe
the
remedies
are
largely
co
extensive
in
that
the
principal
remedy
that
you
would
get
under
the
age
act,
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
and
i
believe
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
although
i
frankly
am
not
certain
about
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
+,...
is
corrective...
is
corrective
action,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is
no
right...
unlike
title
vii,
there
is
no
right
to
compensatory
damages
under
the
age
act
for
things
like
pain
and
suffering
or
emotional
distress;
and
so
in
that
respect
the
age
act
is
quite
different.
what
you
typically
get...
you
get
this
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
and
under
the
age
act
for
discrimination
claims...
is
back
pay,
front
pay
and
corrective
action
to...
to
address
the
discrimination.
the
other
way
in
which
the
age
act,
section
663a,
is
different
than
title
vii...
and
this
is
actually
another
thing
that
makes
it
inherently
incompatible
with
an
anti
retaliation
right...
is
that
the
prohibition
in
section
663a,
the
federal
sector
provision
of
the
age
act,
is
limited
to
employees
who
fit
within
the
protected
class,
employees
over
the
age
of
40.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
then
this
court
would
be
directly
disregarding
the
express
intent
in
section
663a,
where
it
says
affecting
employees
or
applicants
of
employees...
for
employment
who
are
at
least
40
years
of
age.
and
further,
in
section
633--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that's
right,
but
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
anomalies
then
we
have
to
recognize
that
that
is
an
anomalous
grant
of
retaliation
protection
right
that
only
protects
people
within
the
protected
class
with
respect
to
discrimination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it's
a
great
deal
more
anomalous,
with
respect,
justice
souter.
with
both
anti
retaliation
provisions,
whistleblower
provisions,
all
the
provisions
that
the
government
is
aware
of,
including
all
the
ones
cited
in
petitioners
in
its
brief,
protect
all
employees,
all--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
not
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted
it,
justice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
the
courts
have
focused
on
is
the
623d
of
the
private
sector
provisions.
and
that's
the
way--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
that's
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
eeoc
and
i
don't
think
there's
been
any
doubt
in
the
courts
to
date
that
under
the
private
sector
provision
you
can
bring
claims
for
retaliation
if
you're
an
employee,
and
of
course
that's
the
way
it
is
under
title
vii.
we
do
think
that
it
would
be
anomalous
to
say
that
employees
who
complain
about
age
discrimination
or
who
testify
about
age
discrimination
in
a
case
are
not
entitled
to
protection
if
there
is
an
anti
retaliation
right,
and
if
they
are
under
the
age
of
40;
and
there
is
at
least
two
other
respects
in
which--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
that
that's
right.
but
it's
odd
to
say
that
this
prohibition
in
663a,
which
is
clearly
limited
to
people...
and
i
think
by--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that's
not...
that's
not
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted
for
more
than
20
years
under
the
statute.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
is
a
prohibition.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right,
and
then
that
would
be...
their
argument
is
that
663a
contains
that
prohibition,
and
so
therefore
it
is
limited
by
631b.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
not
sure
it's
unusual
to
have
retaliation
claims
piggyback
on
discrimination
claims,
but
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
wouldn't
doubt
that.
i
think
in
most
cases
you
do
have
discrimination
claims.
i
would
say,
though,
that
our
research
indicated
that
in
the
age
discrimination
act
context,
at
least
the
private
sector
context,
only
14
percent
of
the
claims
involve...
cases
involve
retaliation
claims,
which
is
lower
than
other
statutes.
i
wanted
to
point
out
two
respects--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
know.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
she
abandoned
that
claim
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
that's
my
understanding,
justice
ginsburg,
and
of
course
we
are
here
today
because
she
is
still
pursuing
her
anti
retaliation
claim;
and
certainly
if
there
is
an
anti
retaliation
right,
we've
agreed
that
you
could
pursue
that
independent
of
whether
you
complained
about
the
underlying
discrimination,
but
we
do
think
that
in
at
least
three
respects
the
prohibition
in
663a
is
incompatible
with
an
anti
retaliation
right.
one,
we
think
it
is
limited
only
to
the
people
within
the
protected
class,
people
40
years
old.
two,
it's
limited
to
personnel
actions,
which
means
if
you
think
about
it
in
the
context
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
burlington
northern
case
and
the
oregon
case,
it's
limited
to
workplace
related
things
that
happened
to
you,
and
in
burlington
northern
the
court
specifically
said,
in
holding
that
title
vii's
anti
retaliatory
provision
was
broader
than
that,
was
that
it
would
defeat
or
at
least
limit
the
purpose
of
achieving
the
purpose
of
an
anti
retaliation
provision,
to
limit
it
workplace
related
harm.
and
then
third,
of
course,
the
discrimination
that's
expressed
in
section
633
is
discrimination
based
on
age,
not
discrimination
based
on
conduct...
the
conduct
of
complaining
about
or
exercising
your
rights
under
federal
law.
and
that,
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
if
we
have
the
conduct
and
status
alone,
then
i
think
you're
in
the
jackson
box.
but
where
you've
got
the
three
indicia
that
you
have
here,
which
indicate
that
this
provision
is
incompatible
with
the
typical
anti
retaliatory
provision,
and
you
couple
that
with
other
indicia
of
statutory
intent...
you
have
the
competing
schemes
in
the
statute
between
private
sector
where
congress
specifically
delineated
an
anti
retaliation
right,
with
the
fact
that
it
didn't
delineate
that
right
in
the
federal
sector
scheme;
the
evolution
of
the
statute...
where
you
have
congress
specifically
deciding
not
to
put
in
federal
employers
with
private
employers,
as
it
did
for
states
having
the
separate
provision;
and
the
distinctions
between
663a
and
623
of
the
act...
623
of
the
act
is
the
main
private
sector
prohibition;
663a,
the
federal
sector
provision,
doesn't
have
all
the
other
types
of
practices
that
are
prohibited
by
623.
for
example,
pensions...
pensions
are
specifically
addressed
by
623.
congress
didn't
address
that
in
663a
of
this
act.
it
presumably
understood
that
it
either
would
address
it
through
other
means
if
there
were
other
protections
out
there.
similarly
we
think
with
respect
to
retaliation.
congress
knew
how
to
express
an
anti
retaliation
right.
it
did
so
forcibly
in
the
private
sector
provisions
of
the
act;
and
that
language
which
you
find
in
623d
of
the
act
is
simply
completely
absent
in
663a
of
the
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
do
think
that,
justice
alito.
there
certainly
are
several
differences
between
title
vii
and
the
age
act,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
has
explained
each
difference,
but
nevertheless
they
exist
and
this
court
has
recognized
them,
most
recently
in
the
smith
v.
city
of
jackson
case,
where
the
court
noted
that
because
of
textual
differences
between
acts,
there
is
less
protection
with
disparate
impacts
of
discrimination
under
the
age
act
and
title
vii.
it's
also
the
case
that
congress
has
provided
for
compensatory
damages
in
title
vii
and
not
in
the
age
act.
it's
also
the
case
that
there
is
a
right,
a
federal
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
federal
sector
actions
in
title
vii
but
not
in
the
age
act.
and
this
court
has
recognized,
in
smith
v.
city
of
jackson,
that
congress
has
treated
age
discrimination
as
if
it's
qualitatively
different
and
presumably
accorded
different
protections
taking
that
into
account.
so,
the
notion
that
this...
that
the
age
act
is
different
than
title
vii
or
different
than
other
federal
statutes
in
itself
with
respect
to
retaliation
in
itself
is
not
unusual,
and
it's
especially
not
unusual
when
you
take
into
account
that
there
is
this
back
stop
protection
that's--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we...
no,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
the
textual
argument
that
the
courts
have
embraced
with
respect
to
623d,
the
anti
retaliation
provision,
is
because
in
623d
the
congress
specifically
said
"with
respect
to
any
employees
or
applicants.
"
it
couldn't
have
meant
with
respect
to
only
40,
only
employees
who
are
over
40.
and,
again,
that's
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
consistently
for
decades
under
the
statute.
and
we
think,
though,
that
giving
effect
to
the
language
in
633a,
you
have
express
prohibition
limited
to
people
over
40
years
old,
and
that
it
is
anomaly,
and
we're
not
aware
of
any
other
situation
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
is
the
practical
effect.
this
court
has
recognized,
in
bush...
in
the
bush
v.
lucas
case,
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
to
infer
a
retaliation
remedy
for
constitutional
claims
by
a
federal
employee...
that
federal
employment
practices
present
different
questions.
it's
an
area
in
which
this
court
uniquely
defers
to
the
policy
judgments
of
congress,
recognizing
that
congress
has
greater
resources
to
police
federal
employment,
that
there
are
a
number
of
balances
that
have
to
be
struck
between
government
efficiency
and
the
rights
of
federal
employees.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
what
would
happen,
if
you
had
an
employee
alleging
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age
and
retaliation,
that
would
be
a
so
called
mixed
complaint.
they
could
bring
that
to
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
it's
purely--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--a
retaliation
claim,
they'd
have
to
bring
it
under
the
protections
afforded
by
the
civil
service
reform
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't
have
any
evidence.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
wasn't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
guess,
if
i
could
just
add
though,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
doubt
that
certainly
congress
had
any
concerns
about
whether
the
system
under
the
civil
service
reform
act
is
working
properly.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
my
assumption
is
that
congress
felt
that
the
back
stop
protections
that
were
available
for
federal
workers
at
the
time
it
passed
the
age
discrimination
act
and
that
were
subsequently
codified
by
congress
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
were
appropriate
for
people
who
complained
about
age.
as
i
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
know
the...
congress
didn't
tell
us
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
the
reason
would
be
that
congress
viewed
age
discrimination
as
materially
different
than
other
types
of
discrimination,
and
it...
either
it
felt
that
the
risk
of
retaliation
wasn't
as
great
or
that
the
protections...
that
it
didn't
need
to
add
protections.
and
as
i
mentioned--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
again,
congress
didn't
say...
i'm
not...
i
think
you
can
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
why
it
gave
federal
employees
a
jury
trial
right
under
title
vii
but
not
under
the
age
act,
why
it
gave
federal
employees
compensatory
damages
under
title
vii
but
not
under
the
age
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
you
can
bring
them
together.
what
you
would
do
is
you
would
bring
a
discrimination
claim
under
the
age
act
and
you'd
bring
a
reprisal
claim
under
the
civil
service
reform
act.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
can
bring
them
both
together
before
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
if
you're--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
in...
what
would
happen
there
is
you
would
have
your
proceeding
in
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
which
would
decide
the
discrimination
claim
and
the
retaliation
claim.
at
that
point,
the
employee
could
decide
to
go
to
the
eeoc
to
try
to
fight
on
discrimination,
or
the
employee
could
go
to
federal
court,
and
in
federal
court
he
would
get
a
de
novo
trial
on
his...
on
his
discrimination
claim
and
a
record
review--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
and
it's
not
different.
there
are
several
types
of
mixed
claims
that
can
be
brought
in
this
fashion.
once
you
get
to
federal
court
on
your
age
act
discrimination
claim,
you
get
a
trial
de
novo
on
that
claim.
you
just
only
get
record
review
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
claim
because
that's
what
congress
deemed
appropriate.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
it
doesn't
amount
to
an
adverse
action,
then
you
have
to
go
the
route
that
congress
thought
appropriate
for--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
you
would
have...
you
would...
it
would
be
investigated
by
the
office
of
special
counsel.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
would
not,
and
that's
what
congress
deemed
appropriate
for
those
types
of
actions.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
but
there
are
at
least
two
material
textual
differences
between
title
vii
and
the
ada...
and
the
age
act.
the
first
is
that
the
title...
the
title
vii--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
to
understand
the
meaning
of
that
section
you
have
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
whole
section
itself
including
this
express
incorporation.
and,
secondly--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
court
does
not
have
to
decide
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
this
court
recognized
similar
considerations
in
the
bush
versus
lucas
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well...
and
that's
because
congress
gave
them
one,
and
this
is--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think,
at
least
with
respect
to
congressional
employees,
i'm
not
sure
that
they
would
have
been
protected
by
the
civil
service
reform
act
protections
that
existed
for
executive
agency
employees,
but...
but
look
at
the
statutes...
and
we
cite
them
at
page
36
in
the
appendix
and
our
brief...
in
those
two
statutes,
congress
used
the
same
substantive
prohibition
that
is
in
section
633(a):
"all
personnel
actions
affecting
these
employees
shall
be
made
free
from
discrimination
based
on
age.
"
but
they
explicitly
included
a
separate
anti
retaliation
provision,
which,
again...
that's
a
subsequent
statute,
but
that's...
again,
that's
another
indication
that
congress
doesn't
think
that
this
kind
of
general
prohibition
in
section
633(a)
covers
discrimination.
when
it
wants
to
cover
retaliation,
it
passes
an
express
anti
retaliation
provision
thank
you.
