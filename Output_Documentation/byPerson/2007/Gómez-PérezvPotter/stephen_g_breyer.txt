justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
is
that
it
doesn't
exclude
them,
that
they
have
all
these
collective
bargaining
rights;
they
have
the
civil
service
rights;
they
can
go
and
bring
their
same
claim
with
other
remedies.
you
could
make
the
opposite
claim:
why
should
they
have
two
rights?
everybody
else
has
one.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
what
they're
argument
is
underlying
this.
then
when
you
go
to
title
vii...
and
this
i
don't
understand
fully.
look
at
title
vii
and
title
vii
in
16(e)
has
a
basic
ban.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
in
16(d)
it
says
certain
of
those
things
govern
federal
suits,
suits
against
the
federal
government.
then
it
incorporates
some
provisions.
and
it
says
that
you
get
that
certain
relief
against
the
federal
government
where
there
is
discrimination
on
account
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
then
it
says
3(a)>
["].
and
then
3(a)
refers
to
retaliation.
so
it
looks
like
title
vii
does
give
you
a
remedy,
in
3(a),
for
retaliation.
and
it's
rather
specific,
and
that
suggests
that
those
other
words
don't
pick
up
retaliation.
it's
rather
that
specific
thing.
now,
what
have
i
missed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
could
say
that,
but
you
could
also
say,
well,
look
here
in
title
vii
congress
has
some
words,
and
these
words
give
you
a
specific...
if
you're
a
federal
employee
and
somebody's
retaliating
against
you
because
you
went
and
complained
about
race
or
something,
just
read
those
words;
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit,
right?
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
to
the
eeoc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i'm
not
totally
certain
what
i'm
talking
about
either.
so
we
could
go
on.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
in
violation
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
could
you
proceed
with
that?
that
is,
a
very
simple
way
of
thinking
of
this
as
one
possible
way
of
reading
it
is
that
congress
says:
when
private
employers
discriminate,
there
can
be
whistleblower's,
and
they
need
protection;
so
let's
put
some
in.
when
state
officials
discriminate,
say,
on
the
basis
of
race,
there
can
be
some
whistleblower's.
maybe
they
protect
them
in
some
states;
maybe
they
don't
protect
them
in
others.
we
better
put
some
in.
when
federal
government
officials
discriminate
against
on
the
basis
of
race,
whistleblower's
should
be
protected.
but
we
have
a
whole
system
here
to
protect
them.
and
so
let's
just
use
that
system
and
treat
all
whistleblower's
alike,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
we
don't
need
any
special
protection
for
whistleblower's
here.
now,
the
answer
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
now
in
thinking,
just
as
a
matter
of
practice,
where
there
is
retaliation,
a
claim
of
retaliation
in
respect
to
race
discrimination,
federal
government,
that
the
person
making
that
claim
can
go
to
the
eeoc
and
then
to
court?
that's
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
thing
in
respect
to
age,
they
can't,
and
what
they
have
to
do
is
they
go
through
the
civil
service
system
or
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
what
they
do
if
their
claim
is
a
retaliation
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
now,
do
you
have...
two
things:
a,
do
you
have
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
that
one
of
these
two
systems...
the
civil
service
plus
collective
bargaining,
on
the
other
hand;
or
eeoc
plus
the
court,
on
the
other...
works
better,
works
the
same,
works
worse?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
so
we
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
now
what
reason...
okay.
so
we
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
drawing
something
from
where
you
don't
know.
okay.
so
that's
fair
enough.
but
is
there
any...
what
is
the
best
reason,
in
your
opinion,
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
make
this
distinction?
what
are
the
best
two
or
three
reasons?
if
you
were
just
starting
with
a
blank
slate,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
send
the
one
to
the
one
route
and
the
other
to
the
other
route.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
the
people
who
complained
about
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
asking
you,
and
if
you
were
sitting
there
writing
it,
my...
my
thought...
the
conclusion
that
i
would
reach
from
what
you're
saying
is
you
can't
think
of
any
reason
why
you'd
treat
them
differently.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
who...
who
is
such
a
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
can't
they...
why
can't
they
go
to
like
the
merit
system
protection
board?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
are
outside
the
civil
service,
and
they
don't
have
unions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't
have
a
union?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
could
be
fired
for
anything.
