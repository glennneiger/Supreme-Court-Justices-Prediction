mr.
guerra,
can
you
help
me
on
a
provision
of
the
statute
that
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about?
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
section
2000e-16,
which
is
the
provision
under
title...
42
u.s.c....
i'm
using
the
code
number...
that
that
is
the
provision
that
makes
the
federal
government
liable
for
retaliation
based
on
sex
and
race?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
another
provision
that
is
necessary
for
there
to
be
a
remedy
against
the
federal
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
title
vii.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then...
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
precisely
the
same
language
that's
found
in
2000-16e
is
found
in
233a.
justice
john
paul
stevens
633a.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
therefore,
the
two
should
be
treated
alike?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
that
the
language
"shall
be
made
free
from
any
discrimination
based
on
race,
color,
or
religion.
"
and
so
forth,
covers
retaliation.
and
when
you
use
the
same
language
based
on
age
it
also
would
cover
retaliation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
as
simple
as
those
two
provisions
being
exactly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
same
anomaly
applies
to
the
private
sector,
because
section
631a
applies
to
the
private
sector
and
631b
to
the
public
sector.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
language
is
the
same.
they
both
are
limited
to
prohibitions
to
people
who
are
over
40.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
no
reason
why
that
trumps...
any
more
reason
why
that
trumps
631a
than
631b.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
says
that...
the
protection
doesn't
apply.
the
word
is
prohibition...
but
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
explanation
why
the
problem
doesn't
arise
in
the
private
sector.
the
same
explanation
would
apply
to
the
public
sector,
if
you
choose
the
word
prohibition
as
talking
about
these
people
who
are
protected
by
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
garre,
can
i
go
back
to
the
authority
you're
pointing
out
for
a
moment?
is
it
your
reading
of
631a,
the
private
sector
section,
that
says
"the
prohibitions
in
this
chapter
shall
be
limited
to
individuals
who
are
at
least
40
years
of
age.
"
that
it's
correctly
read
as
the
prohibitions
in
this
chapter,
except
those
contained
in
623a,
shall
be
limited?
that's
the
way
you
read
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
effect
of
giving
the
effect
to
the
word
"any"
in
this
section
is
in
effect
to
read
in
this
exception.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
practical
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
garre,
that,
following
up
on
justice
breyer's
question
of
what's
the
reason
for
it,
the
most
striking
thing
to
me
is
that
congress
used
precisely
the
same
language
in
the
two
sections:
"all
personnel
actions
shall
be
made
free
from
any
discrimination
based
on
race,
color.
"
and
so
forth.
that
clearly
includes
retaliation.
but
"all
personnel
actions
shall
be
made
free
from
discrimination
on
account
of
age.
"
does
not
include
retaliation
seems
to
me
rather
anomalous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
key
section
describing
the
prohibition,
the
language
is
exactly
the
same.
