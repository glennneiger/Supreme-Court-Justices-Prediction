mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
claims
in
this
case
that
congress
decided
to
treat
retaliation
against
federal
workers
who
complain
of
age
discrimination
differently
than
every
other
species
of
retaliatory
conduct,
that
for
age
based
retaliation
alone
congress
created
a
four
part
patchwork
scheme
in
which
a
small
cadre
of
federal
employees
have
a
full
judicial
remedy,
but
tens
of
thousands
of
others
who
suffer
retaliatory
conduct
have
absolutely
no
remedies
at
all.
this
scheme
is
inconsistent
with
over
three
decades
of
administrative
interpretations
by
the
agencies
charged
with
administering
and
enforcing
the
statute
and
it
is
flatly
inconsistent,
most
importantly,
with
the
plain
language
and
historical
origins
of
the
statute
itself.
by
its
plain
terms,
section
633a(a)
bars
retaliation
against
covered
workers
who
have
complained
that
have
they
suffered
age
discrimination.
such
retaliation
is
directed
at
persons
over--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
the
provision
is:
"all
personnel
actions
shall
be
made...
affecting
covered
employees
shall
be
made
free
from
any
discrimination
based
on
age.
"
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
submit
it
does
cover
it
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first
of
all
discrimination...
retaliatory
conduct
aimed
at
a
40-year-old
or
someone
over
age
40
because
he
or
she
is
asserting
rights
she
possesses
by
virtue
of
being
age
40
or
older
is
discrimination
based
on
age.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
allege
and
ultimately
prove
that
she
was...
she
suffered
adverse
personnel
actions
because
she
complained
of
age
discrimination.
it
may
be
that
in
some,
that
in
a
certain
case
the
employer
could
demonstrate
that
in
fact
the
retaliatory
conduct
was
not
triggered
by
the
nature
of
the
complaint,
and
in
fact
there
have
been
title
vii
cases
where
the
courts
have
found
that
it
was
the
manner
in
which
a
complaint
was
lodged,
that
there
was,
that
there
was
false
statements
or
it
was
too
inflammatory,
and
so
the
employer
prevailed.
but
if...
the
issue
here
is
whether,
if
ms.
gomez
can
prove
ultimately
that
the
retaliatory
conduct
was
a
function
of
the
fact
that
as
a
40-year-old
she
was
asserting
her
rights
to
be
free
from
age
discrimination,
we
submit
that
is
covered
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
confirmed
by
this
court's
interpretation
of
title
ix
in
the
jackson
case
because
there
the
court--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--mr.
chief
justice,
three
responses
to
that.
first
of
you,
as
this
court
explained
in
jackson
itself,
it's
improper
to
narrow
the
scope
of
a
stand
alone
general
discrimination
ban
that
does
not
identify
any
discriminatory
practices
based
on
a
comparison
with
an
enumeration
ban
that
sets
forth
a
detailed
series
of
prohibitions.
and
that's
precisely
the
comparison
that
the
court
rejected
in
jackson
and
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
draw
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
it
doesn't
in
this
case,
justice
scalia,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
subsection
(f)
of
section
633a
effectively
deems
the
private
sector
and
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
the
age
act
to
be
the
functional
equivalents
of
two
separate
statutes.
so
i
think
that
distinction
is
refuted
by
that
provision.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
government's
argument--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--that
is
the
provision
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
and
it
provides
that:
"any
personnel
action
of
any
department,
agency,
or
other
entity
referred
to
in
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
shall
not
be
subject
to
or
affected
by
any
provision
of
this
chapter
other
than
the
provisions
of
section
631b
of
this
title.
"
and
the
government's
position
is
that
that
provision
makes
these
statutory
schemes
utterly
distinct
from
one
another.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
scalia,
if
i
may,
two
points.
one
is
it's
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
language
of
633a(a)
is
broader
in
its
own
right
than
623a,
which
is
the...
or
623a
and
623b
operate
in
conjunction
with
each
other.
so
we
know
that
the
stand
alone
prohibition
in
the
federal
sector
side
is
intended
to
be
broader
than
the...
the
discrimination
ban
of
623(a).
so
it's
not
anomalous
at
all
to
conclude
that
because
it
sweeps
more
broadly
and
because
it's
not
limited
by
any
other
provision
that
operates
in
conjunction
with
it,
that
there's
no
basis
for
drawing
a
negative
inference.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
alito,
if
i
could...
the
second
point
i
was
going
to
address
to
justice
scalia
i
think
answers
this,
this
point.
congress
did
the
exact
same
thing
in
title
vii
two
years
earlier.
it
could
have
added
federal
employers
to
the
definition
of
employer
and
subjected
them
to
the
private
sector
regime
there,
but
instead
it
created
a
stand
alone
prohibition.
if
you
take
the
government's
logic
in
this
case
and
apply
it
to
title
vii,
it
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
sector
ban
in
title
vii,
which
is
717(a),
does
not
bar
retaliation
either,
and
yet
we
know
that's
not
true.
because--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--you...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it's
not
true
because
of
this
court's
holdings,
but
it's
true
because
of
the
structure
of
the
statute,
the
consistent
interpretations
of
the
lower
courts
and
the
administrative
agency.
the
structure
of
the
statute
is,
in
717(a),
the
language,
the
prohibition
there
is
virtually
identical
to
the
prohibition
here
except
it
proscribes
race
discrimination,
et
cetera,
instead
of
age
discrimination.
then,
in
the
remedy
section
congress
explicitly
made
a
remedy
for
retaliation
available
for
violations
of
717(a)'s
substantive
norm.
the
only
reason
to
do
that
was
because
congress
understood
that
substantive
norm
to
prohibit
retaliation.
congress
then
copied
that
very
same
language
into
633a(a),
thereby
giving
it
the
same
breadth.
and
so
the
negative
inference
theory
the
government
puts
forward
with
respect
to
title
vii
fails
on
that
statute
because
of
the
incorporation
of
the
remedies,
we
know
that
that
prohibition
bars
retaliation.
and
because
the
norm
at
issue
here
was
copied
from
that
federal
sector
prohibition
in
title
vii,
the
same
reasoning
dictates
that
the
argument
fail
here
as
well.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
three
points,
mr.
chief
justice:
first
of
all,
everything
you
just
said
would
be
equally
true
of
discrimination
under
title
vii,
and
yet
the
government
acknowledges
that
retaliatory
conduct
for
race
discrimination
claims,
sex
discrimination
claims,
can
all
be
brought
directly
in
court,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
the
csra.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
well,
i...
justice
ginsburg,
i
read
them
to
be
conceding
for
purposes
of
this
case
and
the
analysis
of
this
case,
and
if
they're
willing
to
acknowledge,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
all
these
other
retaliatory
claims
can
be
brought
outside
of
the
csra
regime,
it
makes
no
sense,
i
submit,
to
single
out
retaliation
based
on
age
discrimination
claims.
and,
in
fact,
congress--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--but,
justice
scalia,
even
if...
if...
even
if
taken
on
the
csra
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
retaliation
for
age
complaints
and
yet
not
for
retaliation
under
title
vii.
also,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
csra
itself
explicitly
carves
out
claims
under
the
adea
and
title
vii.
so,
congress
did
not
view
it
as
the
exclusive--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--that's...
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
of
course,
the
csra
covers
retaliation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
complaints
of
employment
discrimination
as
well.
so
it
would
not
be
rendered
a
dead
letter
by
recognizing
our
position.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i
don't
believe
it
would,
justice
souter,
because
she
did
not
suffer
an
adverse
action.
no,
and
in
fact
putting
that
aside--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--well,
more
fundamentally,
justice
ginsburg,
she's
not
covered
at
all
by
the
csra.
and
that
was
the
third
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
csra
excludes
thousands
of
employees.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect,
the
problem
with
the
government's
reliance
on
the
statute
is
that
it
doesn't...
on
their
view,
white
house
employees
and
congressional
employees
have
a
full
judicial
remedy
for
retaliation
suffered
for
raising
age
discrimination
complaints.
and
our
argument
is
it
makes
no
sense
to
permit
that
one
band
of
employees,
many
high
level
policy
employee...
policymakers,
to
bring
retaliation
claims
in
federal
court,
while
excluding
postal
service
workers
who
have
only
collective
bargaining
rights
and
tens
of
thousands
of
other
employees
for--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
breyer,
the...
you
are
right
to
focus
on
these
remedies,
but
the
remedies
themselves
are
not
incorporated
as
substantive
bans.
they
are
simply
remedies,
and
our
point
is
by
making
a
retaliation
remedy
available
for
a
violation
of
the
ban
that
you
identified
in
subsection
717(a),
congress
necessarily
understood
that
substantive
ban,
717(a),
to
prohibit
retaliation.
otherwise
there
would
be
no
reason
to
provide
a
remedy
for
retaliation
as
one
of
the
remedies
for
a
violation
of--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
don't
think
so--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
breyer.
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
under
section--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--well,
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
under
title
vii
if
you
are
a
person,
an
employee
or
applicant
aggrieved.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i
apologize,
justice
scalia.
it
is
not
in--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
am
talking
about
subsection
(c)
of
717a,
the
federal
sector
provisions
of
title
vii.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i'd
like
to
think
i...
i
can
illuminate
the...
the
language
that
authorizes
federal
employees
to
bring
suits
for
violations
of
title
vii
says
that
if
they
are
aggrieved
by
final
disposition
of
the
complaint,
they
may
bring
a
civil
action
under
title
vii,
and
aggrieved...
they
can
bring
complaints
for
violations
of
subsection
(a),
which
like
subsection
(a)
in
our
statute
says
"all
personnel
actions
affecting
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
shall
be
made
free
from
any
discrimination
based
on
race,
color,
religion.
"
et
cetera.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
no,
it
does
not
say
that,
justice
breyer.
the
prohibition
of
subsection
(a)
of
717a
in
substantive
terms
is
identical,
except
it
specifies
a
different
protected
status.
so
this
is
a
ban
on
discrimination
based
on
race,
color,
religion,
and
you
are
authorized
to
bring
a
suit
if
you
are
aggrieved
by
a
violation
of
that
provision,
and
one
of
the
remedies
that's
made
available
is
a
remedy
that's
available
for
violations
of
the
private
sector
provision
on
retaliation.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
ginsburg,
the
language
"as
applicable"
i
submit
has
to
be
referring
to
whether
the
case
itself
would
implicate
the
need
for
that
remedy.
in
other
words,
it
would
not
be
applicable
to
have
a
reinstatement
remedy
in
a
case
where
there
was
no
discharge.
but
the
reading
that
you
have
suggested
assumes
that
congress
didn't
know
what
it
was...
the
scope
of
the
prohibition
it
enacted
in
section
717(a)
and
was
effectively
saying:
here
are
some
remedies;
we
don't
know
whether
they
apply
or
not,
but
if
they
do,
go
ahead
and
use
them.
and
i
submit
that
is
an
improper
assumption
about
congressional
understanding
of
its
own
legislation.
the
proper
assumption
is
that
congress
understood
717(a)
to
bar
retaliation.
that's
why
it
provided
a
retaliation
remedy,
and
that
assumption
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that,
as
this
court
explained
in
the
brown
v.
gsa
case,
congress
adopted
title
vii
precisely
because
it
found
that
fear
of
reprisal
had
made
the
old
scheme
ineffective.
so
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
it
would
want
to
prohibit
retaliation
under
title
vii
in
the
federal
sector
because
reprisals
had
rendered
the
old
protections
useless.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
that
is
the
very
system
that
congress
had
deemed
ineffective
to
prevent
retaliation
for
the
very
claims
you're
talking
about
in...
and
that's
why
it
chose
to
adopt
the
amendments
to
title
vii
in
1972.
that's
what
the
brown
case
canvasses;
and,
in
fact--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
scalia,
i
apologize
if
i
wasn't
clear
in
my
response,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
the
brown
case
this
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii...
excuse
me...
yes,
in
1972
and
1977...
and
said
that
the
reason
congress
adopted
these,
this
new
prohibition,
was
because
the
very
scheme
that
justice
breyer
is
suggesting
would
have
been
a
fix
for
whistle
blowing
was
ineffective.
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--and
it
is
ineffective
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
that's
correct.
and
the
ineffectiveness
here
is
because
of
the
extraordinarily
limited
nature
of
the
types
of
conduct
that
would
trigger
any
rights
that
the
employee
could
control
under
the
csra.
retaliation
rarely
takes
the
form
of
a
removal
from
position
or
a
suspension
of
more
than
14
days.
the
most
typical
things
are
poor
performance
evaluations,
what
we
have
in
this
case,
allegations
of
groundless
charges
of
misconduct.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
well,
i
was
talking
about
actually
the...
the...
you
can
complain
about
non
adverse
actions
under
the
csra,
but
all
you
can
do
is
ask
the
office
of
special
counsel
to
investigate.
and
then
you
have
no
right
to
compel
any
further
action
at
any
step
of
the
process.
so
if
the
counsel
decides
not
to
investigate,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
if
they
do
and
the
agency
refuses
to
take
their
advice,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
there's
no
judicial
remedy
for
the
vast
majority
of
retaliatory
actions
that
a
federal
employee
could
suffer
under
the
csra.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
that
is
the
remedy
under
the
csra,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
if
the
office
of
special
counsel
doesn't
pursue
the
case...
and
the
statistics
in
the
nteu
brief
suggest
that
it
rarely...
out
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
complaints,
it
pursued
only
in
a
small
handful.
you
have
no
right
as
the
employee
to
do
anything,
to
go
to
the
mspb
or
to
any
federal
court,
if
they
decide
not
to
pursue
that
claim.
and
so
that
is...
and,
again,
both
because
title
vii,
i
submit,
clearly
based
on
the
remedial
structure,
would
allow
employees
to
bring
all
types
of
retaliation
claims
unrelated
to
age
discrimination
complaints
in
federal
court,
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
congress
to
have
relegated
older
workers
who
suffer
age
discrimination
to
this
one
scheme,
especially
because
it
excludes...
petitioner
herself
has
no
rights
under
the
csra.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
that
is.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
for
retaliation
based
on
race
and
sex?
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
no.
that's
the
remedy.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
633a.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
precisely.
that
is
the...
that
is
our...
one
of
our
central
arguments.
of
course,
we
also
realize--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--absolutely,
justice
stevens.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
ginsburg,
even
if,
as
i
anticipate,
they
will
not
make
that
concession,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
remedial
structure
of
title
vii,
the
federal
sector
provision,
confirms
that
the
substantive
ban
that
justice
stevens
read
necessarily
covers
retaliation.
otherwise,
congress
wouldn't
have
made
a
retaliation
remedy
available.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
precisely
the
same...
the
same
is
precisely
true
of
title
vii.
section
704a
of
title
vii
is
the
analog
to
623(b)
in
our
case.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
that
is
true,
but
our
position--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--not
precisely
the
same,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
court's...
in
that
case,
for
example,
this
court
said
when
you
copy
language
verbatim
into
another
statute,
there
must
be
some
compelling
evidence
that
you've
intended
to
have
given
it
a
different
meaning.
if
you
look
at
the
remedy
section
of
section
633a(c),
all
you
see
there
is
not
some
dramatic
difference,
but
what
congress
did
was
it
replicated
the
civil
action
provisions
of
the
private
sector
in
the
federal
sector
provision.
so
it's
not
as
though
there's
some
stark
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
have
a
drastically
different
regime.
it
simply
didn't...
rather
than
incorporate
subsection
(c)
of
the
private
section,
626c,
it
simply
replicated
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i'd
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
i
want
to
emphasize
the
practical
reality
that
there
are
thousands
of
employees
who
have
no
remedies
under
any
of
the
schemes
we
are
talking
about:
employees
of
tva,
employees
of
the
general
accounting
office,
these
employees
of
the
transportation
security
administration.
they
have
no
collective
bargaining
remedies,
no
csr
remedy,
and,
according
to
the
government,
no
remedy
under
the
adea.
justice
ginsburg,
on
title
vii,
not
only
has
the
government
failed
to
challenge
the
lower...
consistent
lower
court
interpretations.
the
eeoc's
interpretation
of
this
provision
is
that
it
bars
retaliation
in
the
title
vii
sector...
title
vii
bans.
and
so
when
you--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--they
have
no
remedies
for
retaliation
under--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--they
do,
justice
scalia,
but
my
point
is--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--our
argument
is
that
it
makes
no
sense
to
give
some
people
remedies
under
one
scheme
and
leave
some...
congressional
employees
getting
full
remedial
relief,
people
under
the
csra
getting
a
limited
remedial
relief,
others
getting
remedies
under
the
collective
bargaining
rights
and
thousands
of
others
have
no
remedies
only
with
respect--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
believe
they
are
not
allowed
to.
the
entities
i
mentioned,
i
believe,
are
not
allowed
to.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
because
they
simply
have
none
of
the
remedies
the
government
has
put
before--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--an
employee
of
the
transportation
security
administration.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
they
are
excluded
from
the
civil
service
reform
act.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
they
don't
have
bargaining
rights.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
well,
they
have
claims
for
discrimination
if
they
suffer
age
discrimination
directly,
but
if
they
complain
about
age
discrimination
and
then
get
fired
in
retaliation,
they
have
nothing.
and...
and
just--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--but
it's
not
consistent
with
their
rights
under
title
vii,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
as
the
eeoc
has...
an...
is
entitled
to
deference,
it
has
said,
for
three
decades.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i
do.
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
necessarily
do,
but
i
certainly
think
it
compels
the
conclusion
i
am
advocating
if
you
reach...
if
you
reach
the
issue.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i
recognize
that,
justice
scalia,
and
i
apologize.
i
would
also
like
to
note
that
there
was
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
congress
didn't
care
as
much
about
age
discrimination.
that's
refuted
by
the
house
report
that
accompanied
this
very
statute.
it's
quoted
at
page
23
of
the
aarp
brief
where
the
congress
said
age
is
as
great
an
evil
in
our
society
as
discrimination
based
on
race
and
religion.
whether
or
not
this
court
agrees
with
that
assessment
as
an
objective
matter,
that's
the
view
of
the
congress
that
adopted
this
statute.
and,
as
justice
stevens
noted,
they
have...
they
adopted
the
statute
by
incorporating
the
language
from
title
vii,
the
exact
same
language
where
title
vii's
remedial
scheme
makes
clear,
and
the
eeoc's
consistent
interpretation
confirms,
that
that
then
prohibits
retaliation
for
complaints
of
race
or
gender
discrimination.
by
incorporating
that
same
language
in
the
adea's
federal
sector
provision,
congress
necessarily
gave
it
the
same
scope;
and,
by
doing
so,
eliminated
the
various
anomalies,
to
put
it
mildly,
that
the
government's
position
leads
to.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
