justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
this
court
hasn't
so
held.
we
haven't
had
that
issue
before
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
the
government...
well,
we'll
ask
the
government,
but
i
thought
they
kind
of
qualified
that
in
their
brief.
the
brief
says
that
the
case...
this
case
presents
no
occasion
to
consider
whether
title
vii's
ban
on
discrimination
against
federal
sector
employees
incorporates
that
act's
private
sector
retaliation
ban.
so
they
haven't
made
a
concession.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
could
complain;
it's
just
that
she
couldn't
go
very
far
with
the
complaint.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
that
so
clear,
because
section
2000e,
16(d)
says
section,
whatever
it
is,
f
through
k
of
this
title,
as
applicable,
shall
govern
civil
actions
brought
hereunder.
and
if
there
is
no
right
against
retaliation,
then
the
remedy
wouldn't
be
applicable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
isn't
that
simple
because
the
government
hasn't
conceded
that,
with
respect
to
title
vii,
federal
employees
are
covered
for
retaliation.
if
the
government...
we'll
ask
them...
will
make
that
concession,
then
the
argument
is
very
strong.
the
words
are
identical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not,
given
the
jackson
precedent,
where
there
was
a
similarly
general
ban
on
discrimination
and
we
defined
discrimination
to
include
retaliation
for
complaining
about
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's...
mr.
garre,
that's
traditionally
when
you're
suing
the
government,
you
don't
get
a
jury.
and
so
that's
on
one
side.
here,
as
i
think
you
would
recognize,
retaliation
claims
go
hand
in
hand
with
discrimination
claims.
a
person
who
is
discriminated
against
will
quite
commonly
say:
i
was
not
promoted
because
that
was
discrimination
and
then
because
i
complained
about
it
all
these
bad
things
happened
to
me.
it's
very
common
that
those
two
go
together.
and
yet,
without
any
indication
that
congress
meant
to
send
a
federal
employee
off
to
one
forum
to
argue
discrimination
and
another
forum
to
argue
retaliation,
without
any
hint
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
it
would
be
rather
strange.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
i
recognize
it's
not
absurd.
but
if
there
is
ambiguity
and
one
interpretation
is,
well,
that
in
every
other
context
retaliation
goes
together
with
discrimination,
why
would
congress
leave
out
this
one
category
of
persons,
especially
when
it
might
have
said,
well,
the
supreme
court
says
discrimination
includes
retaliation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
government's
position?
what
does,
for
example,
eeoc
or
whoever
passes
on
these
complaints,
what
is
the
government's
position
in
practice
with
respect
to
a
federal
employee
who
complains,
a,
i
was
discriminated
against
because
of
my
race
and
then
they
retaliated
against
me
for
complaining?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
any
federal
court
found
otherwise?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
agree...
then
you
agree
with
mr.
garre
about
the
meaning
of
those
words
"as
applicable"?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
said
don't
incorporate
private
sector?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
must
be
an
explanation
for
that
section.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
could
she
get...
what
could
she
get
by
way
of
remedy?
and
you
recognize
that
this
employee
is
not
covered
by
the
civil
service
act,
but
does
have
collective
bargaining
rights.
suppose
there
is
a
finding
of
reprisal
in
that
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
the
typical
retaliations
claim,
though,
like
the
one
in
this
case,
whether
it's
under
title
vii
or
the
age
discrimination
act?
that
is,
i
think
i
have
a
solid
claim
of
discrimination,
but
maybe
not.
nevertheless,
once
i
filed
that
complaint,
this
unit
doesn't
like
people
who
complain
about
sex
discrimination,
age
discrimination.
therefore,
i
was
retaliated
against.
in
this
case,
isn't
it
the
fact
that
the
age
discrimination
claim,
the
claim
of
direct
discrimination,
was
rejected
and
the
question
is
but
nonetheless,
was
there
a
retaliation
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
something
you
said
before,
rather
pleadingly.
one
is
if
one
could
imagine
a
claim
just
for
reprisal,
but
you
called
something
a
"mixed
claim"
if
you're
suing,
as
she
started
out
to
sue,
for
both.
so
if
you're
suing
for
both,
on
your
theory
you
still
must
split
them
up?
you
cannot
bring
the
reprisal
claim
together
with
the
discrimination
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
different
administrative
mechanism.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
oh,
but
how
about
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you...
you
would
be
putting
everything
under
the
civil
service
umbrella
and
nothing
under
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
it
didn't
amount
to
an
adverse
action
under
the
civil
service
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
you
wouldn't
get
to
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
it
would
not
be
within
your
control.
it
would
not
be
up
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wasn't
there...
there
was
something
that
was
said
about
this...
that
doesn't
apply
to
congressional
employees
or
white
house
employees,
that
they
would
have
a
claim
of
retaliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
would
congress
say
when
you...
when
it's
congress
that's
doing
the
reprisal,
we're
going
to
give
you
a
suit,
but
not
if
some
other--
