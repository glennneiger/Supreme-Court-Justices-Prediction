justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
by
its
plain
terms?
justice
antonin
scalia
read
it
to
me,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
retaliation
discrimination
based
on
age?
i
can
see
your
argument
that
it
ought
to
be
covered,
but
to
say
that
the
plain
language
covers
it,
i
mean
that's
extraordinary.
the
plain
language
doesn't
cover
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
jackson
it
was
in
a
different
statute
and
here
it's
in
the
same
statute.
surely
that
makes
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
provision.
what
does
that
provision
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no.
i
mean,
they're
all
in
the
same,
in
the
same
statute,
and
what
that
provision
says
is
that
just
because
we
give
certain
relief
in,
in
the
portion
applicable
to
private
discrimination,
does
not
mean
that
we
give
that
relief
in
the
section
applicable
to
government
discrimination,
where
it
is
explicitly
withheld...
it
can't
be
explicitly
withheld...
where
it
is
withheld,
although
it's
explicitly
included
for
private
discrimination.
i
think
that's
the
only
sensible
way
to
read
that
provision.
it
surely
doesn't
make
two
statutes
out
of,
out
of
one.
it
is
simply
one
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
saying
even
if,
even
if
that
were
the
case,
they
would
still
urge
the
court
to
come
out
the
way
they
do.
i
don't
think
they're
conceding
that
that's
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this
stuff?
where
is
this
text
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
in
your
brief.
it's
not
in
the
appendix.
so
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
we
don't
have
here
now.
i
guess
i
can
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
sort
of
begging
the
question.
i
mean,
you're
saying
it's
not
true
because
our
interpretation
of
title
vii
is
true.
but
the
point
goes
to
how
you
ought
to
interpret
title
vii.
that
is,
it
makes
more
sense
to
say
when
it's
retaliatory
action
you
use
your
federally
prescribed
remedies
within
the
agency.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
answer
the
point
that
justice
breyer
made
to
say,
because
we
want
to
interpret
title
vii
the
way
we
want
to
interpret
it.
his
point
is:
one
reason
to
interpret
it
the
way
you
do
want
to
interpret
it
is
that
it
makes
more
sense
to
have
all
of
the
federal
remedies
applied
through
the
agency,
through
the
agency
mechanism,
rather
than
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
though
we
are
talking
here
a
prohibition
against
taking
retaliatory
action.
isn't
that
a
prohibition?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
garre,
are
we
going
to
have
to
decide
the
title
vii
question
in
this
case?
we
don't
even
have
the
materials
in
front
of
us.
they
haven't
been
put
in
the
appendix
to
the
briefs.
and
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
a
title
vii
case
that
hasn't
even
been
presented?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
would
you
clarify
your
earlier
statement:
these
people
have
no
remedies
just
for
retaliation?
they
do
have
remedies
for
the
age
discrimination,
but
not
for
retaliation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
remedies
for
age
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
have
a
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
have
given
us
the
statute
to
look
at
if
that's
the
case.
