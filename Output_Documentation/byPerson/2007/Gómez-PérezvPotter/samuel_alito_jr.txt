well,
why
would
congress
have
taken
this
drafting
approach?
the
private
sector
provisions
were
already
in
existence
when
it
made
the
statute
applicable
to
federal
workers
and
there
was
a
specific
provision
prohibiting
retaliation
in
the
private
sector.
if
congress
wanted
to
carry
that
over
to
the
federal
sector,
why
wouldn't
they
have
either
copied
that
or
incorporated
it?
and
they
did
neither,
and
in
fact
they
enacted
a
provision
that
says
that
the
private
sector
provisions
are
not
incorporated
unless
they're
specifically
noted.
and
this
isn't
one
of
the
ones
that's
noted.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
it
be...
would
it
be
unkind
to
say
that
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
that
a
general
ban
on
discrimination
includes
a
ban
on
retaliation
except
when
the
government
is
being
sued?
in
jackson
the
government
argued
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
included
retaliation.
tomorrow
the
government
is
going
to
argue
that
the
prohibition
of
discrimination
in
section
1981
includes
retaliation.
and
yet
here
you're
arguing
exactly,
what
seems
to
me
exactly
the
opposite
position.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
you
say
what
the
government's
position
is
on
title
vii,
whether
there
is
a
retaliation
remedy
against
the
federal
government?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
quite
the
contrary,
mr.
garre,
that
most...
if
you
did
a
statistical
analysis
of
all
the
cases
in
which
there
was
a
retaliation
claim,
you
doubt
that
you
would
find
that
a
very
high
percentage
of
those
are
cases
in
which
the
person
claiming
retaliation
is
also
the
person
who
claimed
the
underlying
discrimination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
plausible
that
congress
intended
to
treat
the
issue
of
retaliation
in
the
federal
sector
differently
under
the
various
federal
anti
discrimination
statutes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit.
petitioner
myrna
gomez-perez
was
a
window
distribution
clerk
for
the
united
states
postal
service
in
dorado,
puerto
rico.
in
2002,
when
she
was
45
years
of
age,
she
requested
and
was
granted
a
transfer
to
another
branch.
when
she
later
requested
a
transfer
back
to
her
original
position,
her
request
was
denied.
after
filing
an
unsuccessful
grievance
with
her
union,
petitioner
filed
an
equal
opportunity
complaint
with
the
postal
service
alleging
that
the
denial
of
the
transfer
was
the
product
of
age
discrimination.
according
to
petitioner,
she
was
thereafter
subjected
to
various
forms
of
retaliation,
including
having
her
job
hours
reduced.
petitioner
responded
by
filing
this
suit
claiming
that
the
postal
service
had
violated
the
federal-sector
provision
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
by
retaliating
against
her
for
filing
an
equal
opportunity
age
discrimination
complaint.
the
federal-sector
provision
states
that
"all
personnel
actions
affecting
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
who
are
at
least
40
years
of
age
shall
be
made
free
from
discrimination
based
on
age.
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
prohibition
of
discrimination
based
on
age
does
not
cover
retaliation
for
filing
an
age
discrimination
complaint
and
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
petitioner's
complaint.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
in
interpreting
the
phrase
discrimination
based
on
age,
we
are
guided
by
our
prior
decisions
in
sullivan
versus
little
hunting
park
and
jackson
versus
birmingham
board
of
education.
in
sullivan,
we
interpreted
42
u.s.c.
section
1982
which
prohibits
discrimination
based
on
race
and
property
transactions
and
we
found
that
section
1982
prohibits
retaliation.
more
recently,
in
jackson,
we
interpreted
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972,
20
u.s.c.
section
1681
which
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
educational
programs,
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
relying
on
sullivan,
we
held
that
this
is
ban
on
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
likewise
prohibits
retaliation.
following
the
reasoning
of
sullivan
and
jackson,
we
interpret
the
adea's
federal-sector
provisions,
prohibition
of
discrimination
based
on
age
as
likewise
proscribing
retaliation.
the
statutory
language
at
issue
here
is
not
materially
different
from
the
language
that
we
construed
in
jackson
and
it's
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
statutory
language
in
sullivan.
moreover,
the
statutory
context
is
the
same
in
all
three
cases,
remedial
provisions
aimed
at
prohibiting
discrimination.
for
this
reason
and
others
setout
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
joined
in
part.
