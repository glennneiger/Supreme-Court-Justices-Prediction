chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-989,
hall
street
associates
v.
mattel,
inc..
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
phillips--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mr.
phillips,
why
do
you
care?
if
this
is
not
enforceable
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
gives
you
kind
of
a
shortcut...
the
district
court
must
confirm
it
if
certain
criteria
are
met...
i
assume
you
have
a
normally
enforceable
contract
that
the
district
court
can
enforce
just
like
it
enforces
any
other
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
should
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
should
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
we
should
conclude
that
you
don't
fall
within
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
it's
not
a
big
deal
because
you
can
bring...
you
can
have
the
contract
enforced.
the
district
court
as
far
as
i
can
tell
wants
to
enforce
this
agreement,
presumably
will
enforce
it
as
a
contract.
so
you
don't
need
the
federal
arbitration
act,
so
why
should
we
fly
in
the
face
of
its
plain
language
to
accommodate
your
interests?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
there
a
basis...
well,
the
federal
arbitration
act
doesn't
provide
jurisdiction
anyway.
so
i
assume
you
have
a
basis
for
being
in
federal
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
first
place.
so
you're
just
enforcing
a
contract
in
diversity
in
federal
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you're
asking
us
to
bring
it
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
say
that
the
district
court
must
confirm
it
despite
the
fact
that
you've
changed
the
standards
under
section
9
to
11.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
my
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--my
point
is
that
if
you
have
an
ordinary
contract
action
the
district
court
will,
because
your
contract
provides
a
particular
standard
of
review,
enforce
that.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
have
in
fact.
on
page
43
of
their
brief,
they
say
that
if
you
prevail
the
parties
would
be
left
to
a
state
law
contract
action
to
determine
the
enforceability
of
the
award.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
their
citation
is
to
an
arbitration
treatise.
the
contract
they're
referring
to
is
the
contract
to
arbitrate.
and,
unless
i'm
mistaken,
what
you
want
is
for
the
district
court
to
be
able
to
enforce
your
agreement
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
fall
squarely
within
it
because
the
federal
arbitration
act
sets
different
standards
of
review.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
see
what
the
big
deal
is
because
you...
okay,
don't
use
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
gives
you
kind
of
an
express
remedy
the
district
court
must
confirm.
use
normal
contract
law
and
say
to
the
district
court:
well,
you
don't
have
the
federal
arbitration
act,
you
don't
have
to
confirm
it
as
a
judgment,
but
we
have
a
contract,
it's
perfectly
valid,
it
sets
a
different
standard
of
review,
you
should
enforce
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
arbitration
provision,
the
arbitration
agreement
is
just
a
contract.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
i
don't
understand
why
it's
not
enforceable
as
a
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it's
enforceable...
i'm
obviously
missing
something
here.
if
it's
enforceable
as
a
contract,
what
is
the
great
benefit
you
get
out
of
prevailing
and
saying
this
should
be
enforced
under
the
federal
arbitration
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
if
you
have
a
contract,
an
arbitration
agreement
that's
not
covered
by
section
2,
it's
not
concerning
a
maritime
transaction
or
involving
commerce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
in
the...
why
is
that
the
case?
i
mean,
this
doesn't
purport
to
occupy
the
field
of
arbitration
and
to
preempt
state
law.
it
provides
that
a
very
direct
order...
the
district
court
must
confirm
the
arbitration
award
as
a
judgment--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
fall
within
the
criteria.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
they'll
say,
okay,
i
don't
have
to
confirm
it
as
a
judgment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
you're
in
section
2,
i
agree--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
agree
that
you're
in
section
2,
and
the
state
court
can't
invalidate
your
agreement
under
some
special
rule
that
applies
only
to
arbitration.
but
you
want
to
be
under
section
9,
and
that
says--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
the
district
court
must
confirm
the
arbitration
award
if
it
meets
certain
standards.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
only
basis--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
only
basis
you
have
for
getting
them
to
correct
the
award
is
a
different
standard
of
review
than
the
one
provided
in
section
10.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
happens
outside...
that
happens
all
the
time.
they
are
called
consent
decrees.
the
party
agrees,
and
agrees
to
particular
provisions,
and
they
submit
it
to
the
judge
and
say:
we
want
you
to
write
two
words,
"so
ordered",
at
the
bottom
of
this;
and
then
it
becomes
a
judgment.
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
arbitration
act.
it's
a
contract.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
same
question
for
you
that
i
had
for
your
friend:
why
do
you
care?
i
mean,
if
you
are
saying,
look,
you
can
enforce
this
as
a
state
law
contract...
you
know,
it's
not
streamlined.
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
do
it;
but,
you
know,
this
judge
wants
to
do
it.
and
he
is
going
to
enforce
it
as
a
state
law
contract.
what
do
you
gain?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
go
back
to
state
court.
you
have
diversity.
you
are
in
federal
court,
no
matter
what;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
there--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure,
if
the
parties
agree,
and
here's
our
stipulation:
we
agree
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
pennsylvania
and
you're
a
citizen
of--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
thought
your
answer
would
be
part
the
point
justice
stevens
brought
up
earlier.
there
was
this
state
hostility
to
enforcing
arbitration
agreements
at
all--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
so
what
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
is,
all
right,
in
the
narrow
circumstances
where
the
parties
agreed,
subject
to
this
narrow
standard,
you
have
to
enforce
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
are
going
to
override
the
state
law
across
the
board.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
you
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
