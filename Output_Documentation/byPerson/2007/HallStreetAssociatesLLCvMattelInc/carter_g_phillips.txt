mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
two
very
sophisticated
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
an
ongoing
dispute
that
was
pending
in
litigation
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon.
their
agreement
states
plainly
that
after
an
arbitration
award
is
issued
the
district
court...
and
this
is
at
pet.
app.
16a...
"shall
vacate,
modify,
or
correct
any
award
where
the
arbitrator's
conclusions
of
law
are
erroneous.
"
ultimately
what
this
court
must
decide
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
either
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
any
other
federal
law
that
renders
this
non-adhesive,
unambiguous
contract
agreement
unenforceable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
be
more
concerned
about
identifying
a
standard
of
review
for
the
district
court
than
identifying
a
standard
for
modifying
the
arbitration
award
pursuant
to
the
agreement.
so
i
think
that's
a
different
issue.
i
think
that's
closer
to
dealing
with
a
judicial
function
than
this
is,
which
is
simply
implementing
the
intent
of
the
parties
as
to
what
the
standard
ought
to
be
for
enforcing
an
initial
award.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
ginsburg,
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
limit
to
party
autonomy.
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
very
strong
preference
for
party
autonomy,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
if
i
were
here
and
i
had
an
agreement
by
which
de
novo
review
is
the
standard
i
wouldn't
defend
that
autonomy.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
recognize
that
there
are
limitations
on
autonomy
that
recognize
the
functions
of
the
judiciary.
but
that
limitation
isn't
remotely
implicated
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
one
i
think
worries
me
less
because
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
suggest...
i
mean
it
just
says
that
we
will
leave
to
the
district,
to
the
district
court
the
findings,
and
essentially
renders
the
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
again,
the
parties
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
are
perfectly
free
to
decide
whether
they
want
those
issues
to
be
decided
conclusively
by
the
arbitrator
or
to
have
them
adjudicated
at
the
end
of
the
day
by
the
federal
court.
and
so,
if
they
choose
to
go
through
the
arbitral
process,
and
then
still
say
nevertheless
that's
nonbinding
and
that
the
district
court's
free
to
evaluate
that
on
a
de
novo
record,
that
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
in
fact
implicate
the
judicial
function
in
quite
the
same
way
that
the
standard
of
review
does.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
precisely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
in
that
context
you're
not
raising
the
same
problem
that
you're
referring
to,
justice
ginsburg,
because
you're
not
saying
anything
about
the
standard
of
review.
you're
just
simply
saying
that
the
court
ought
to
decide
the
legal
issues.
now,
i
do
think
that
when
the
parties
agree
that
it's
a
question
of
law
that
the
question
of
law
is
for
the
district
court
to
decide.
my
assumption
is
that
the
district
court
in
fact
will
use
de
novo
review,
but
the
parties
are
not
dictating
that.
that's
a
matter
that's
left...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
do,
but
that
issue...
that
standard
of
review
is
not
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
error
of
law
committed,
and
obviously
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
clear
error
of
law
committed.
indeed,
the
dissenting
judge
below
said
it
was
an
irrational
decision
on
the
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
there
are,
there
are
clearly
two
different
standards
that
are
set
out
in
the
arbitration
agreement
and
one
of
them
is
substantial
evidence.
but
when
the
matter
went
from
the
arbitrator
to
the
district
court
there
was
no
issue
presented
by
hall
street
on
the
question
of
substantial
evidence.
we
didn't
challenge
any
of
the
factual
findings
by
the...
by
the
arbitrator,
and
therefore
that
issue
is
not
presented.
i'm
not
saying
i
wouldn't
defend
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
have
to
defend
it
in
this
particular
case
because
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
there
has
been
an
error
of
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
problem
there...
and
again,
i
think
this
is
largely
a
fanciful
concern
because
i
don't
think
serious
parties
who
are
engaged
in
arbitration
agreements
are
likely
to
come
up
with
standards
that
are
completely
alien
to
the
judicial
process,
and
indeed
there's
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
that.
certainly
respondent
didn't
cite
anything
and
our
amici
didn't
cite
anything
like
that.
but
to
be
sure,
judge
kozinski
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
original
panel
decision
in
kyocera
said
he
would
have
a
very
different
reaction
to
this
case
if
we
were
talking
about
the
district
court
either
flipping
a
coin
or
looking
at
the
entrails
of
dead
birds
as
the
basis
for
decision.
and
our
basic
point
is
we're
not
embracing
that
extreme
approach.
i
mean,
we
recognize
party
autonomy
as
a
significant
part
of
what
section
2
of
the
arbitration
act
is
all
about
and
we
think
that
ought
to
drive
the
analysis
of
this
court
significantly,
particularly
in
how
you
interpret
section
9.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely
true,
particularly
in
this
context,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
here
we
have
a
situation
where
we
were
before
the
district
court,
this
arrangement
came
out
of
the
mediation
process,
the
district
court
reviewed
it,
blessed
it,
sent
it
to
the
arbitrator--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
it
came
right
back.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no,
i
should
win.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
the
problem
here
is
not
what
happens
in
the
instance
if,
section
9
not
applying,
that
we're
suddenly...
we
go
back
to
square
one
and
start
over.
that
might
be
true
in
a
different
case,
but
in
this
particular
case
we
started
in
federal
district
court.
we
brought
this
action
as
a...
as
a
contract
action.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
diversity,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
that's
exactly
what
we
would
ask
this
court
to
be
doing
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
flipped
it
around.
remember,
we
lost
in
the
arbitration.
we
won
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
was
prepared
to
enforce
the
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
both
the
underlying
lease
agreement
and
the
arbitration
agreement.
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
that
said
no,
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
enter
a
final
judgment
in
this
case,
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
no,
that's
absolutely
true.
but
that's
exactly
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
thought
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
was
just
looking
for
the
case
of
the
day,
your
honor,
actually.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
know
that...
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
which
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
has
a
very
strong
preference
for
enforcing
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
is
a
part
of
the
answer
to
that.
and
you
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
justice
story,
back
as
early
as
1814,
said
that
as
a
matter
of
common
law
that
the
notion
of
restricted
arbitration
is
a
matter
completely
left
to
the
parties.
so
i
think
that
there
are
general
common
law
standards.
now,
you
know,
could
oregon
law
have
gone
the
other
way
on
that?
maybe.
i
think
it
would
be
an
interesting
preemption
question.
but
the
respondent
has
never
argued
that
this
is
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
oregon
law.
so
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
case
management,
if
the
court
wants
to
defer
to
anything
then
it
ought
to
refer
to
the
district
court's
own
assessment
that
this
agreement
should
be
utterly
enforceable,
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
they
never--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
it
is
enforceable?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
we've
never
argued--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oregon
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
the
state
law
contract
action
that
they're
talking
about
is
precisely
the
state
law
contract
action
we
brought
in
this
case
before
the
federal
district
court
under
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
we're
asking
for
is
for
the
court
to
enforce--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
district
judge's
determination--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
it
falls
squarely
within
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
congress
had
a
choice
as
between
those
alternatives,
congress
clearly
in
section
9
made
it
absolutely
indisputable
that
there's
a
simple
way
to
enforce
it,
but
it
didn't
suggest
the
alternative,
which
is
that
you
relegate
it
to
some
kind
of
state
law,
completely
complicated
process
to
try
and
get
this
arbitration
award
enforced
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
we
clearly
can't
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
i
think
the
court,
this
court
is
the
court
that's
got
to
decide
that
at
this
point
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
we
disagree
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the...
i
think
that's
enforceable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
benefit
is
the
efficiency
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
trying
to
promote.
i
mean,
to
be
sure,
there...
there
could
potentially
be
any
number
of
routes
you
might
want
to
identify.
the
clearest
one
is
where
the
parties
don't
care
about
what
happens
on
the
back
end,
where
they
say,
once
you
get
your...
you
have
your...
you
get
your
arbitration
award
and
then
you
go
off
and
you
do
section
9
and
we
don't
have
any
agreement
on
that.
and
that
one
is
easy,
and
that's
the
most
efficient.
then
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
in
a
situation
where
the
parties
don't
agree
with
that,
where
they
want
the
district
court
to
review
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
those
are
regulated
by
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
purely
by
state
law.
but
this
is
the
contract
that
falls
within
section
2,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that's
sort
of
the
core
question
i
think
that
sort
of
comes
out
of
southland
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean,
i
think
that's
what
southland--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
the
logic
of
southland,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i
think
the
answer
to
the
conundrum
you've
raised,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
if
you're
not
in
section
9,
then
you
ought
to
be
in
section
2,
and
there
you
should
do
precisely
what
the
contract
says,
which
is
that
you
should
vacate
or
set
aside
the
arbitration
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--unless...
if
there's
an
error
in
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
don't
need
section
9.
all
i
need
is
section
2
because
if...
because
under
our
agreement,
what
we
specifically
say
is
that
the
district
court
shall
vacate,
modify,
or
correct.
we're
looking
for
them
to
correct
this
award
by
saying
that
the
right
interpretation
of
this
lease
is
that
this
is
an
applicable
environmental
law,
and
therefore
the
indemnification
extends
and
we
are
protected.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
what
i
want
under
section
2.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
true,
but
that's...
it
seems
to
me
that
just
makes
my
point,
which
is
i
don't
need
section
9,
your
honor.
all
i
need...
all
i
need
is
an
aggressive,
not
even
aggressive...
a
fair
interpretation
of
section
2
that
says
that
the
parties'
intent
controls
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
quite
true.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
know
that
that's
the
problem.
you're
right,
i
don't
want
section
9
to
be
controlling
here,
but
i
don't
think
it's
meant
to
be
controlling
under
these
circumstances.
i
think
what...
i
mean
they're
making
the
section
9
argument.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
not
a
problem
created
by
section
9.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
when
you
say
"it's
meant
to
be
controlling",
i
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--section
9.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
well,
the
answer...
the
plain
language
doesn't...
doesn't
say
what
happens
if
the
parties
reach
a
different
agreement.
the
first--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think...
well,
first
of
all,
it
would
seem
to
me
less
likely
that
that's
true,
given
the
common
law
history
that
comes
out
of
justice
story's
opinion,
which
said
restrictive
arbitrations
are
common.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
souter,
there
are
two...
there
are
two
questions
there,
so
let
me
try
to
answer
both
of
your
questions.
the
first
one
is:
what
does
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
say?
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
which
is
at
1a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
is
the
parties
in
their
agreement
agreed
that
a
judgment
of
the
court
shall
be
entered
upon
the
award.
we
never
agreed
to
that,
so
the
plain
language
of
section
9
simply
doesn't
get
you
there.
section
9
envisions
that
this
is
a...
that
this
is
an
understanding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
under
section
2
the
parties
have...
have
provided
a
mechanism
for
that
by
saying
that
the
district
court
will
correct
an
award
if
it's
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
section
9
doesn't
apply
in
this
particular
context,
and,
therefore,
it
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
hopefully
i
can
persuade
you
by
rereading
the
portion
of
the
statute,
that
the
first
sentence
of
section
9,
which
is
at
appendix
1:
"if
the
parties"--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--1a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
section
9:
"if
the
parties
in
their
agreement
have
agreed
that
a
judgment
of
the
court
shall
be
entered
upon
the
award--
"
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--these
parties
didn't
agree
that
a
judgment
would
be
entered
on
the
award.
they
agreed
that
a
judgment
would
be
entered
on
the
basis
of
whether
there
was
a
non-erroneous
declaration
of
law
by
the
arbitrator.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
both
parties
agreed
to
it
under
section
2.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
if
you...
if
you
want
to
make
a
judgment
call
and
you
think
there's
really
a
judgment
you
have
to
make
as
between
section
2
and
section
9,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
the
court's
decisions
have
recognized
that
the
single
most
important
objective
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
embodied
in
section
2,
which
is...
which
is
to
enforce
the
intent
of
the
parties--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
you
way
you
should
come
out.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
do
you
do?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,
justice
souter--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
i
have
come
to
grips
with
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it's
not
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
it
is
every
facet
of
the
agreement
is
to
be
enforced
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
of
course
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
to
be
sure.
but
the
bottom
line
here...
and...
and
i
do
want
to
answer
the
illinois
v.
new
york
part
of
this,
because
i
think
that's
a
complete
red
herring
in
this
case.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
if
you
think
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
with
respect
to
section
9,
first
you
should
resolve
that
ambiguity
by
construing
it
to
implement
the
parties'
intent,
because
that
is
the
overriding
objection
to
the
faa.
and
second--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
you
go
to
section
10--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--okay.
all
right,
let
me
answer
the
red
herring.
then...
then
i'll
tell
you
what
i
think
about
section
10.
on
the
red
herring,
all...
all
the...
first
of
all,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
made
some
kind
of
conscious
choice
between
new
york
and
illinois.
they
talk
about
the
new
york
model.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
about
illinois.
so
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
decision
was.
but
even
if
that
were
the
choice
they
made,
that
still
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
what
do
you
do
if
the
parties
reach
a
different
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
none
of...
none
of
those
cases
fall
in
that
category.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
important
part
about
section
10
to
keep
in
mind
is...
is
their
argument
also
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
section
10
exhaustively
lists
all
of
the
grounds
for
modifying
an...
vacating
an
arbitration
award.
and
it
is
absolutely
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
both
in
wilko
and
in
w.r.
grace
that
the
list
in
section
10
is
not
an
exclusive
list.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
manifest
disregard
of
the
law
and
the...
and
public
policy.
w.r.
grace
says
you
can't
enforce
any
contract
that
violates
public
policy.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i...
i
think,
yes,
i
think
it
probably
would,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
think
congress
meant
for
it
to
be...
i
don't
think
congress
intended
for
this
to
be
not
subject
to
change.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
mean,
you
know,
there
are...
the
question
in
all
of
these
provisions
is
are
there
some
components
of
the
faa
that
are
meant
to
be
mandatory,
and
there
are
others
that
are
all
subject
to
change.
and
i
think
that
one
strikes
me
at
least
as
most
likely
subject
to
change,
justice
stevens.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
section
9.
i
hate
to
use
the
words
faa>
["],
because
here's
the
situation:
you
can
have
arbitration
awards
that
are
clearly
covered
under
section
2,
but
they
are
not
covered
under
section
9.
section
9
is
a
streamlined
procedure
for
enforcement
of
arbitration
where
it's
under
the
faa.
when
congress
enacted
the
statute,
they
said,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
give
a
streamlined
approach.
if
you
want
to
go
quickly
from
award
to
judgment,
you
can
go
right
into
court
and
hear
section
9.
that...
and
you
could
agree
to
this.
you
have
to
agree
to
use
section
9.
you
have
to
agree
to
this
confirmation.
you
come
in,
and
that
court
must
enforce
that
award,
confirm
that
award,
unless
sections
10
and
11
are
met.
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
try
to
give
you
back
some
of
that
time
before
i'm
done.
in
my
experience
in
evaluating
cases
like
this,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
ways
where
you
end
up
depends
in
large
measure
on
where
you
start.
and
the
parties
fundamentally
disagree
about
whether
or
not
this
is
an
agreement
that
should
be...
you
know,
who's
got
the
burden?
do
we
have
to
show
that
this
agreement
is
authorized
by
something
or
are
we
entitled
to
have
this
agreement
and
it's
their
burden
to
demonstrate
clearly
that
congress
meant
not
to
allow
this
to
be
enforced?
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
it's
their
burden
to
find
something
specific
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
otherwise
that
precludes
this.
section
9
doesn't
get
them
there
because
section
9
is
predicated
always
on
an
agreement
of
the
parties
in
the
first
instance,
and
so
that's
not
a
basis
for
doing
that,
but
even
if
you
thought
section--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
see
how
the
severability
ruling
has
any
relevance
to
this
particular
problem,
because
what
we're
saying
is
we
are
entitled
to
enforce
the...
the
agreement
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
exactly
what
the
district
court
has
the
authority
to
do.
the
fact
that
it...
whether
it's
severable
or
not
severable
doesn't
mean
that
we're
not
entitled
to
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
as
written
by
the
parties.
severability
doesn't
eliminate
our
right
to
have
that
part
of
the
agreement--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse.
remember,
severability
only
comes
up
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
that
this
provision
in
the
contract
was
unenforceable.
and
then
the
question
is,
is
there
any
part...
you
know,
is
the
entire
arbitration
set
aside.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
initial
decision
is
wrong.
and,
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
severability.
and
the
reason
why
it's
wrong
is
because
it's
their
burden
to
show
something
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that's,
that
precludes
enforcement
of
this
provision.
section
9
doesn't
get
you
there.
section
10
wouldn't
get
you
there
because
it's
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
because
of
the
"if"
clause.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--subject
to
the
condition
that
the
district
court
would
make
a
determination
that
there
was
no
error
in
law.
and
that...
i
mean,
that's...
you
know,
they
had...
i
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
the
point
is
if,
if
all
you
do
is
agree
to
an
arbitration,
then
section
9
and
section
10
apply
directly.
but
if
you
agree
to
an
arbitration
that
is
subject
to
legal
error
or
review,
okay,
then
the
"if"
clause
doesn't
prevent
you
from
being
allowed
to
have
that
portion
enforced,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
enforcement
would
be
under
the
existing
authority
that
the
district
court
had
in
this
particular
case,
because
this
was
a
case
that
was
pending
before
the
district
court
under
diversity
jurisdiction
seeking
to
enforce
the
lease
agreement.
and
we
have
a
final
decision
from
the
arbitrator.
the
judge
has
now
made
a
decision
that
that
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
has
enforced
the
lease
in
a
particular
way.
and
so
the
question
is,
is
that
judgment
of
the
district
court
subject
to
challenge?
and
our
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
prevents
the
district
judge
from
doing
precisely
what
it
did.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
not
sure
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
those
two
things,
between
those
two
things...
statements.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
we
can
win
on
either
theory.
my
whole
point
here
has
been
section
9
doesn't
prevent
us
from
being
able
to
do
this.
section
10
is
not
an
exhaustive
list
and,
therefore,
we
are
allowed
to
add
to
section
10.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
regardless,
you
ought
to
interpret
this
under
section
2,
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
ensure
that
we
get
what
we
want.
the
one
point
i
did
want
to
make
about
how
all
of
this
operates
is,
you
know,
in
the
relationship
between
the
courts
and
arbitrators,
it
seems
to
there
is
probably
no
more
important
issue
than
who
decides
whether
something
is
arbitratable.
and
yet,
this
court
held
quite
clearly
in
first
options
that
even
though
the
statute
says
it's
the
arbitrator...
i
mean,
that
it's
the
court,
it
can
be
made
the
arbitrator
by
the
parties.
thank
you,
your
honor.
