mr.
phillips,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
agreement
provided
for
de
novo
review
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be...
i
am
assuming
that
the
parties
wrote
that
standard
into
their
contract,
so
to
the
extent
you're
relying
on
party
autonomy
why
couldn't
the
parties
elect
whatever
standard
of
review
they
wish?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
were
both...
they
were
both
in
this
agreement,
both
the
substantial
evidence
rule
and
the
standard
of
review
of
legal
error.
so
are
you
saying
that
you...
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
that
question
or
you're
not
going
to
defend
it,
because
the
standard
was
dual.
am
i
not
right
about
what
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
doesn't
read
like
one.
10
and
11
don't
read
like
default--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
else
is
there
besides
the
manifest
whatever?
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
public
policy?
that
was
the
other
one
mr.
phillips
brought
up.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
miss
brinkmann,
can
we
back
up
a
bit,
because
this
agreement
had
an
usual
genesis.
this
was
a
big
case,
and
the
judge
kept
right
in
the
court
a
piece
of
it.
and
then
he
and
the
parties
agreed
that
another
piece
of
it
would
best
be
resolved
in
arbitration.
so
the
judge
was
in
equal
participation
in
that
effort.
all
three
parties
wanted
to
get
a
particular
issue
resolved
through
an
arbitrator
rather
than
the
court,
itself.
and
i
doubt
very
much
whether
the
judge
would
have
been
at
all
interested
in
that
scheme
if
he
thought
he
were
doing
an
idle
thing.
that
the
parties,
having
agreed
to
just
what
the
judge
thought
was
a
nice
way
to
resolve
this
issue,
would
then
find
themselves
out
of
federal
court
and
have
to
bring
some
kind
of
suit
in
state
court.
it
doesn't
seem
to
fit
this
scenario.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not
use...
why
not
use
rule
16,
pretrial
procedure,
and
the
parties
and
the
judge
can
work
out
what
they
think
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
resolve
this
controversy?
so
they
decide
at
the
pretrial
conference
that
they
are
going
to
build
into
this
arrangement
one
issue
that
they
are
going
to
peel
off
to
go
to
an
arbitrator,
but
the
judge
is
going
to
retain
control
through
the
legal
error.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
strange
argument
in
this
respect.
you
are
arguing
that
this
non-article
iii
person
has
more
control
rather
than
less
control;
that
if
the
judge
controlled
this
arbitrator,
somehow
that
would
violate
article
iii.
but
if
the
judge
has
no
control
and
is
essentially
little
more
than
a
rubber
stamp
on
what
the
non-article
iii
person
does,
then
that's
all
right.
and
the
sense
of
that
doesn't
come
across
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
any--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
there
any...
are
there
any
such
states
left
today
that
are
using
the
illinois
model?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
possibility
that
the
reason
the
language
in
the
statute
is
as
it
is...
when
was
the
federal
arbitration
act;
what
year
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
there
was
still
abroad
in
the
land
considerable
distrust
of
arbitrators.
judges
said
arbitrators
are
stepping
on
our
turf,
and
so
they
would
be
naturally
resistant
to
let
the
arbitrator
go
ahead
and
have
the
most
minimal
review
in
court.
maybe
the
act
was
written
the
way
it
was
to
say,
if
the
parties
want
to
go
to
arbitration,
courts,
you
stay
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
let's
take
this
statute
and
let's
take
the
circuits
that
have
the
rule,
the
opposite
rule.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
had
the
opposite
rule
until
rather
recently.
what
has
been
the
experience...
i
think
the
fifth
circuit
is
on
the
other
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
has
been
the
experience
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
a
lot
of
those
horribles,
mr.
phillips
would
agree
with
you
because
he
hesitated
even
on
de
novo,
and
i
think
he
thought
that
trying
to
control
an
appeal
from
the
district
court,
that
would
be
out
of
the
ballpark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
problem
that
i
have
with
your
position
is
you
say
that
the...
you
should
continue
to
prevail,
although
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
parties'
agreement.
under
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
you
win,
what
the
arbitrator
says
goes,
and
there
isn't
the
review
that
the
parties
bargained
for.
