justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
uh-huh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
just
a
default
rule
or
a
self-executing
definition
of
what's
permissible,
supposing
the
agreement
between
the
parties
provided
that
the
judgment
by
the
court
must
be
entered
in
6
months
rather
than
a
year,
and
it
would
be
vitiated
if
it
were
entered
after
that.
would
that
trump
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
under
your
theory
you'd
have
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
on
that
for
just
a
minute?
you're
assuming
and
the
chief
justice's
line
of
questioning
was
assuming
there's
an
adequate
state
remedy
available
for
enforcing
this
contract,
but
the
whole
premise
of
the
statute
at
the
time
it
was
enacted
was
that
there
was
not
a
state
remedy,
because
there
was
a
bias
against
arbitration.
and
this
was
thought
to
be
the
sole
remedy
for
arbitration
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
sort
of
basic
question?
forgetting
the
text
for
a
minute,
what
policy
reason...
can
you
think
of
why
would
congress
want
to
prohibit
this
particular
form
of
agreement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
they
want
to
prohibit
an
option
that
takes
a
little
bit
longer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
they
want
to
prevent
the
parties
from
choosing
the
option
they
chose
in
this
case?
i
don't
think
that
answer
says
why
they'd
want
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
there'd
be
no
arbitration
at
all.
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
just
don't
understand
why
it
makes
any
sense
at
all
to
say
this
type
of
arbitration
agreement
is
invalid.
