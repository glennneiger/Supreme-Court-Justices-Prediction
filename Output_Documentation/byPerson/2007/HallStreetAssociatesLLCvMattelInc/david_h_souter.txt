justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
that
you
don't
need
section
9.
you
want
to
get
rid
of
section
9--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
section
9
on
its
face
seems
to
provide
the
opposite
to
what
you're
asking.
isn't
that
the
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't...
i
mean
the
argument
that
it
is
meant
to
be
controlling
is
an
argument,
first,
for
the
plain
language.
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon
me?

david

souter
section
9.
justice
david
h.
souter
number
one,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
number
two,
an
argument
that
that
plain
language,
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact,
was
deliberately
chosen
when
congress
made
a
choice
between
two
different,
basic
arbitration
schemes.
and
they
chose
the
arbitration
scheme
that,
in
effect,
does
not
allow
the...
the
kind
of
variation
that
you're
talking
about.
so
they
say
the
language
is
plain;
the
intent
behind
the
language
is
plain.
it
is
restrictive,
and
you
can't
do
that.
what
is
your
response,
in
effect,
to
the
plain
language
construed
in
terms
of
the
historical
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not...
it
may
not
say
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
says
unequivocally
what
should
happen,
and
you
are
asking
for
a
variation
on
what
it
unequivocally
provides.
that
may
be
the
reason
it
does
not
go
into
contingencies.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
you're...
you're
ignoring...
when
you
say
that,
you're
ignoring
the
development
of
arbitration
in
the
period
after
justice
story;
and
you
are
ignoring
the
argument
that
the
other
side
makes
that
a
deliberate
choice
was
made
between
two
generally
understood
arbitration,
statutory
arbitration,
schemes,
and
they
choose...
they
chose
the
one
that
is
inconsistent
with
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
how
can
you
get
any
award
enforced,
even
subject
to
your
terms?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
have
to
grapple
with
the
question
whether
in
fact
under
section
2
you
can
provide
for
confirmation
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
provision
for
confirmation
under
section
9.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
simply...
i...
i
don't...
maybe
i'm
missing
something,
but
you
seem
to
stand
there
and
just
say
baldly:
section
9
doesn't
apply.
it
doesn't
apply,
you've
repeated
that
several
times.
and
i
at
least
don't
know
why
it
doesn't
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
and
what
you
are
arguing
is:
at
this
point,
even
though
we
didn't
agree
within
the
meaning
of
the
preamble
to
the
first
sentence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--we
still
have
a
right
to
have
the
award
confirmed
and
enforced--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
we
agreed
to
it
under
section
2.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
question,
i
think,
is
when
you
argue
in
that
fashion:
do
you
have
a
right
under
section
2
to
provide
for
confirmation
and
enforcement
under
terms
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
provision
in
section
9.
and
i
think
that's
the...
that's
the
question
you've
got
to
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
the...
the
cases--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
intent
of
the
parties
that's
being
enforced
in
those
myriad
cases
is
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
i
don't
believe
any
of
those
cases
respond
to
the...
to
the
issue
that
we've
got
before
us.
and
the
issue
we've
got
before
us
as
you
are
now
framing
it
is
this:
if
you
do
not
have
a
provision
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence
of
section
9--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
consummation
and
enforcement--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you
have
a
different
contractual
provision
and
its
terms
are
different
from
the
enforcement
terms
under
section
9--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can
that
contract
be
recognized?
do
you
have
a
right,
in
effect,
to
modify
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
what
you've
got
to
come
to
grips
with.
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
it
does
not
answer
that
question
simply
to
say
there
are
lots
of
cases
saying
that
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate
should
be
enforced.
this
is
a
more
specific
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
do
you...
do
you
have
a
case
that
says
every
facet
of
the
agreement,
no
matter
how
inconsistent
arguably
with
other
sections
of
the
statute?
[laughter]
no,
you
don't.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
why
we've
got
this
case
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
we
do
that,
we've
got
to
dispose
of
the
red
herring.
so
you're
going
to
come
back
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
phillips'
argument
that,
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
sentence
of
section
9,
you
don't
have
any
agreement
at
all;
and,
therefore,
you
have
no
right
to
enforce
anything?
i
take
it
that's
not
the
position
you
took
below,
and
that's
not
the
position
you're
taking
here,
but
how
do
you
answer
him?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
question
is
still
here:
why
should
there
be
a
limit
if
the
parties
themselves
agree?
because
if
they
didn't
come
in
under
arbitration
and
they
simply
came
in
under
contract
or
whatever
the
causes
of
action
might
be
in
a
diversity
case,
the
court
would
have
to
be
dealing
with
these
issues
anyway.
justice
david
h.
souter
pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
true
in
any
diversity
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
why
didn't
congress
give
any
guidance?
one
suggestion
that
the
chief
justice
made,
and
it
played
through
my
mind,
is
maybe
the...
what
seemed
to
be
the
plain
language
limits
in
section
9
represent
not
necessarily
a
kind
of
policy
choice
in
a
perfect
world,
but
a
political
policy
choice.
maybe
that
was
the
term
as
you...
as
you
read
section
9,
maybe
that
was
the
term
upon
which
the
act
could
be
passed.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
will,
in
effect...
we
will
say:
look,
you
got
to
enforce
these
contracts,
arbitration
contracts,
but
you
don't
have
to
go
one
step
further.
maybe
that
was
the
political
deal.
is
there
any
indication
that
that
was
the
case
and
that's
the
explanation
for
this
limit?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
about
her
argument
that
we
are
limited
in
considering
your
argument
by
the
severability
ruling
that
you
didn't
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
does...
it
does
preclude...
i
mean,
her
answer
is
an
answer
to
the
argument
that
you
were
making
in
response
to
a
question
of
mine
earlier,
that
in
fact
you
don't
have
an
agreement
within
the
meaning
of
the
preamble
portion
of
section
9.
she
says
you
do
because
you
have
one
after
severance
and
you
didn't
appeal
severability.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
–
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
in
the
course
of
litigating
a
lease
dispute
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
petitioner,
hall
street,
and
the
respondent,
mattel,
proposed
to
submit
their
differences
to
arbitration.
they
drew
up
an
arbitration
agreement
which
the
district
court
entered
as
an
order
and
which
specified
that
the
court
would
review
the
arbitrator's
award
for
legal
error.
the
arbitrator
initially
decided
for
mattel
that
the
district
court
vacated
the
award
for
legal
error
citing
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
a
case
called
lapine
technology
for
the
proposition
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
the
faa
allows
parties
to
agree
upon
the
terms
of
a
court's
review
of
an
arbitrator's
award
and
these
parties
could
therefore
agree
to
review
for
legal
error.
on
remand,
the
arbitrator
rule
–
ruled
for
hall
street
and
the
district
court
largely
upheld
the
new
award,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
basis
of
its
recent
en
banc
kyocera
decision.
that
decision
overruled
lapine
and
held
that
parties
were
not
free
to
add
to
the
grounds
for
judicial
review
provided
in
the
faa.
since
the
faa
did
not
provide
for
legal
error
review,
the
parties
could
not
provide
for
it
by
agreement.
after
another
remand
in
appeal,
we
granted
cert
to
consider
whether
the
faa's
grounds
for
judicial
review
of
arbitration
awards
are
exclusive.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
faa's
listed
grounds
are
exclusive,
but
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
for
consideration
of
independent
issues.
sections
9
through
11
of
the
faa
offer
expedited
judicial
review
of
arbitration
awards
through
a
process
like
action
on
a
motion.
under
section
9,
a
court
must
confirm
an
award
unless
it
is
vacated,
modified
or
corrected
as
prescribed,
those
are
the
words
in
sections
10
and
11.
section
10
allows
vacatur
where
an
award
was
procured
by
corruption,
fraud
or
undue
means
or
where
the
arbitrators
were
guilty
of
--
of
misconduct
or
exceeded
their
powers
and
section
11
lists
grounds
for
modifying
or
correcting
an
award
including
evident
miscalculation,
evident
mistake
and
imperfections
in
form.
we
think
the
text
of
these
provisions
compels
the
conclusion
that
they
are
exclusive.
even
if
some
expansion
were
possible,
it
would
not
extend
a
full-bore
review
that
the
hall
street
seeks.
the
section
10
and
11
grounds
address
specific
instances
of
fairly
extreme
arbitral
conduct
alongside
which
review
from
illegal
errors,
it's
pretty
uneasily.
aside
from
that,
the
text
of
section
9
makes
clear
that
any
expansion
rubs
too
much
against
the
textural
grain.
there
is
nothing
permissive
about
its
provision
that
an
award
must
be
confirmed
unless
vacated
or
modified
or
as
prescribed
in
sections
10
and
11.
so
instead
of
finding
the
text,
it
makes
more
sense
to
see
sections
9,
10
and
11
as
the
substance
of
a
national
policy
favoring
arbitration
with
just
the
limited
review
needed
to
maintain
its
essential
virtue
of
resolving
disputes
straight
away.
in
holding
that
sections
10
and
11
provide
exclusive
regimes
for
the
expedited
review
afforded
by
the
faa,
we
say
nothing
about
other
possible
avenues
for
judicial
enforcement
of
arbitration
awards.
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
arbitration
agreement
was
drawn
up
in
the
course
of
litigation
and
adopted
as
a
court
order,
has
prompted
some
of
us
to
ask
whether
that
order
should
be
treated
as
an
exercise
of
the
district
court's
case
management
authority.
supplemental
briefing
took
up
the
question
that
the
party's
arguments
implicate
issues
that
have
not
been
considered
previously
in
this
litigation
and
which
could
not
be
very
well
addressed
for
the
first
time
here,
we,
therefore,
leave
these
issues
open
for
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.
justice
scalia
has
joined
the
opinion
except
for
footnote
7,
which
will
undoubtedly
be
the
best
read
footnote
in
the
opinion.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kennedy
joins
and
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
