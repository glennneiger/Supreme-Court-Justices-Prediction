ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
sections
9,
10
and
11
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
provide
the
exclusive
grounds
on
which
a
court
can
vacate,
modify,
correct
an
arbitration
award
under
the
faa.
those
grounds
do
not
include
legal
error.
what
petitioner
wants
is
to
graft
on
an
additional
ground
to
that
statute,
and
say,
oh,
10(a)(5),
on
any
other
ground
that
the
parties
agree
to.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
manifest
disregard
is
section
10
(a)(4),
exceeding
the
power.
it
is
not
mere
legal
error,
and
it's
manifest
disregard
of
the
agreement.
section
10
goes
to
structural
errors,
structural
problems:
corruption,
fraud,
exceeding
the
power.
and
manifest
disregard
is
in
the
statute,
and
it's
not
mere
legal
error.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
was
required
in
wilko,
because
there
were
two
different
questions
there.
there
was
a
provision
under
the
securities
act
that
said
customers
couldn't
waive
certain
rights.
and
the
court
said
there:
well,
we
all
know
that
the
securities
act
generally
would
apply
to
arbitration.
of
course,
if
an
arbitrator
didn't
apply
the
securities
act,
that
would
be
manifest
disregard,
exceeding
their
power.
that
they
could
not
do.
but
what
the
wilko
court
held
was:
the
customer,
if
they
went
to
arbitration,
was
also
waiving
judicial
review
of
the
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
law.
and
that
was
the
distinction
in
wilko,
and
that's
why
manifest
disregard
is
in
the
statute.
it's
10(a)(4),
and
it's
that
type
of
error.
it
is
not
beyond
the
statute,
and
that's
what
congress
meant
to
do.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
public
policy
would
often
be
covered
under
section
2.
section
2
allows
any
arbitration
contract
to
be
voided
under
any
generally
applicable
state
contract
law,
so
that
clearly
would
apply.
a
lot
of
that
would
capture
off
as
public
policy.
but
"public
policy"
is
used
in
different
ways.
the
grace
case
he
cites
is
a
labor
case.
and
there
have
been
different
developments
of
arbitration
under
the
labor
statute.
but
what
public
policy
has
come
to
mean
in
that
line
of
cases
is
where
there
is
another
federal
statute
that
is
violated
by
the
arbitration.
and
there
you
have
another
source
of
law.
if
there
is
a
later
enacted
federal
statute
that
was
a
congressional
intent
to
trim
the
arbitration
act,
that's
another
matter.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
you
can't
in
that
situation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
would
be
a
common
law
action
that
the
chief
justice
was
referring
to,
to
simply
enforce
an
award.
but
section
9
created
a
streamlined
approach
for
enforcement
of
arbitration
awards.
when
congress
in
1925
said--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--there
are
a
couple
of
differences,
i
would
also
say,
with
the
consent
decree
from
the
section
9
enforcement
of
the
award,
your
honor.
here,
of
course,
congress
spoke
to
it.
and
it
clearly
set
up
a
framework
for
section
9,
10,
and
11:
how
could
you
have
this
streamlined,
efficient,
final
way
to
get
a
judgment.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
faa.
so
you
don't
have
that
in
a
consent
decree
situation,
and
you
would
not
have
that
in
a
common
law
contract
action.
also,
of
course,
in
that
consent
decree
situation,
courts
maintain
their
equitable
authority.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
we
gain
a
little
of
what
we
try
to
get
through
arbitration:
finality,
the
cessation
of
the
time
and
cost
that
this
litigation
has
arisen.
we
prevail
under
the
ruling
of
the
court
that
recognized
the
exclusivity
of
sections
9,
10
and
11;
and
that
would
end
the
litigation.
that's
certainly
of
very
great
interest
to
our
client.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
really
a
repackaging
of
petitioner's
severability
argument
from
below.
there
was
an
agreement
to
confirm.
it's
just
whether
or
not
if
the...
it
becomes
legally
impossible
for
the
other
condition
to
occur,
the
legal
review
can't
occur
because
it's
contrary
to
the
statute.
what
happened...
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
addressed
that
issue,
applied
oregon
law,
and
rejected
it.
petitioner
filed
a
rehearing
en
banc
petition
on
that
and
did
not
bring
it
to
this
court
on
cert.--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
this
is
under
section
9.
the
only
way
it
would
not
be
under
section
9
is
if
they
had
won
on
the
severability
argument.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
thought--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--two
responses,
at
least
to
that,
your
honor:
then
the
parties
should
have
asked
the
court
to
appoint
a
special
master.
that
maintains
under
the
authority
of
the
district
court
judge.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
and
that's
important.
what
is
before
the
court
here
is
the
section
9
action
to
confirm
the
judgment.
and
that's
what
comes
to
the
court
on--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
if
it
comes
to
a
question
about
the
particular
facts
in
this
case
involving
the
scenario
that
justice
ginsburg
put
forth
of
the
very
unusual
situation
of
a
federal
district
court
being
there,
we
would,
of
course,
dismiss
the
writ
as
improperly
granted.
that
has
no
broader
implication,
i
think--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
would
be
the
question,
your
honor,
if
when
faced
with
something
that
a
judge
wants
to
peel
off,
you
have
to
look
at
what
tools
a
federal
judge
has
been
given.
magistrate
judges
widely
used
for
all
types
of
picking
juries,
discovery,
special
masters,
those
are
the
tools
that
have
been
given
to
federal
judges.
when
arbitration--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
arbitrator
is
what
introduces
these
different
elements,
because
that's
a
private
judge
chosen
by
the
parties,
paid
by
the
parties.
he
doesn't
have
life
tenure.
it's
a
very
different
animal.
and
what
congress
did
in
the
federal
arbitration
act--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
because
it's
a
matter
of
contract
law,
justice
ginsburg.
the
parties
agreed
to
an
arbitration
here
on
a
contract
and
the
arbitrator's
award
speaks
for
the
parties.
it
is
their
agreement.
that's
what
an
arbitration
award
is,
and
that's
why
this
streamlined
process
under
section
9
to
transfer
that
award,
that
contractual
agreement--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it's
the
only
means
to
get
an
award
enforced,
but
if
you
are
doing
the
section
9
route,
the
grounds
in
the
statute
are
the
only
grounds
on
which
that
can
be
done,
and
the
policy
about
whether
or
not
those
transaction
costs,
when
parties
want
further
review
on
an
arbitration,
is
shifted
to
the
courts.
it's
one
congress
made--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
where
we
get
to...
between
when
we
are
talking
about
section
2
and
the
purpose
is
that
the
parties
control
how
the
arbitration
progresses.
then
we
come
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment
by
a
court,
and
that's
what
congress
controls;
and
the
grounds
in
10
and
11
cannot
be
perceived
as
default
rules.
there
are
many
places
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
where--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
two
things,
your
honor.
if
they
want
to
do
that,
then
they
don't
choose
section
9,
and
they
don't
include
an
agreement
for
section
9,
and
then
they
have
what
chief
justice
roberts
was
talking
about,
a...
a
state
contract
action--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
that
actually
brings
me
to
a
red
herring.
i'd
like
to
address
the
history,
because
i
think
that
what
happens
in
petitioner's
reply
brief,
there's
some
confusion
between
common-law
causes
of
action
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award
as
a
contract,
and
actions
under
statutes.
some
of
the
commentators
confuse
that
also.
there
was
an
opportunity
to
have
judicial
review
of
the
law
through
a
contract
enforcement
case,
although
there
was
a
clear
statement
requirement.
so
there
are
going
to
be
cases
that
talk
about,
that
are
not
under
the
statue.
then
when
you
look
at
cases
under
the
statute,
you
have
to
differentiate
between
the
cases
under
the
new
york
model
statutes,
where
you
will
not
find
that,
and
cases
under
the
illinois
statute,
where
you
will,
because
they
allow
judicial
review.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
now,
when
justice
scalia--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
believe
not,
your
honor.
we
explain
in
one
of
our
footnotes
that
that
came
into
disfavor.
but
i
want
to
address
justice
scalia's
point
about
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
case
that
we
have
found
that
says,
notwithstanding
those
statutory
grounds,
you
can
contract
beyond
them,
but
we
do
have
not
only
the
new
york
cases,
but
also
in
footnote
8,
i
believe,
on
page
30,
several
other
statutes
have
statutory
grounds,
and
repeatedly
they
say
these
are
the
statutory
grounds.
that
is
separate
from
the
common-law
action
where
you
could
have
a
full
jury
trial.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
the
language
in
those
cases
will
speak--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
cases
say
things
like
on
the
statutory
grounds,
where
they
do
say
it.
do
they
go
the
next
step
and
say
by
the
way,
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
else
that's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
no.
there's
none
on
the
other
side,
either.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
1925.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
if
you
choose
that...
yes,
your
honor.
and
even
one
more
step.
but
we
will
tell
the
court
to
stay
out
of
it
only
if
you
agree
that
you're
going
to
come
under
for
confirmation.
it's
still
let
the
parties
have
the
review
through
common
law
if
they
want
it.
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it's
that
additional
step,
though,
that
puts
the
whole
picture
together.
and
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
there
is
appellate
arbitration
that
takes
care
all
of
the
policy
concerns
about
whether
or
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor.
i
have
looked
at
many
of
the
old...
some
of
the
arbitration
cases
did
come
up
from
admiralty,
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
if
it
is
an
action
under
section
9
to
confirm,
it
must
be
confirmed
unless
there
is
vacatur,
modification,
or
correction
under
10
or
11.
those
are
exclusive
grounds.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
that
question,
though,
perhaps
goes
to
more
or
not
whether
the
section
9
is
the
exclusive
means
for
enforcing
an
award,
and
it
isn't.
so
perhaps
there
is
some
other
means
that
is
beyond
my
expertise.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
that
sign
would
have
to
be
changed.
it
would
have
to
say--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--there
are
a
couple
of
things.
that's
not
an
arbitration
award.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
have
to
say--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
court
would
not
be
bound
by
that.
it's
not
a
mandatory
standard.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think,
i
think
there
would
be
a
state
bar--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
and
it's
collusion.
it
goes
to
our
argument.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it
would
have
depended
on
what
the
court
did
with
it.
so
long
as
it
was
not
binding
on
the
federal
court,
because
you
can't
buy
an
injunction.
you
cannot
stipulate
to
the
erroneous
law.
the
article
iii
judge
maintained
that
authority.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
difficult,
because
it's
an
award--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
right.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
this
is
an
arbitration
award.
it
is
a
contractual
agreement
where
the
award
gives...
imposes
a
legal
obligation
on
someone
else,
and
that
award
is
going
to
be
entered
as
a
judgment
of
the
court,
against
the
parties.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
congress
wanted
to
give
parties
an
option
for
a
quick,
simple,
cost-effective
and
final
way--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
that
would
be
a
different
action
where
you
have
to
look
to
state
contract
law,
contract
law
defenses,
whether
there
are
state
arbitration
laws...
it's
a
different
animal.
they
were
looking
at
the
animal
of
an
arbitration
agreement
and
a
streamlined
method
to
have
that
enforced
and
that's
what
sections
9,
10,
and
11
do.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
uh-huh.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
right.
it
gives
the
parties
the
option
for
choosing
that,
and
if
you
choose
that,
you
have
to
do
what
congress
says.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
they
can
choose
another
option,
but
they
may
have
a
full-blown
trial
about
contract
law
in
the
award,
and
that's
what
section
9
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
also
have--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
it's
invalid.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we're
not
saying
it's
invalid,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
there's
entitlement
to
confirmation
of
the
award
unless
the
grounds
of
10
and
11
are
there.
and
petitioner
wants
to
graft
on
the
thing
that
says
"or
on
any
ground
the
parties
agree
on.
"
there's
no
limit
to
that,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
for
harmless
error--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
would
be
under
a
different
cause
of
action,
justice
souter.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
you'd
be
under
state
contract
law.
here
you'd
have
to
develop
a
federal
common
law
of
when
you
took
a
section
9
and
you
started
reviewing
it
for
error.
are
we
really
going
to
allow
de
novo
review
and
vacatur
when
it's
harmless?
there's
a
whole
body
of
federal
law
that
has
developed
about
harmless
error
to
address
those
kinds
of
issues.
this
would
be
a
federal--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but,
your
honor,
this
would
be
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
without
any
guidance
from
congress,
contrary
to
the
grounds
they
put
forward.
and
they
have
no
limit.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
it
was--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--with
all
respect,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
section
2
and
3,
the
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
agreement,
is
about
the
private
parties
determining
the
process.
but
when
you
get
to
the
entry
of
a
judgment
by
a
court
on
the
award,
what
congress
did
said:
we're
going
to
give
you
an
option
to
have
an
efficient,
streamlined
way
for
that
also,
and
here
it
is:
9,
10
and
11.
now,
you
still
have
something
else
and
you
have
to
agree
to
this
in
your
agreement,
but
if
you
agree
to
it,
this
is
what
you
have.
and
i
have
to
say
petitioner's
argument
is
so
broad,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
there
were
questions
of
fact
in
this.
we
were...
we
were
litigating
under
this
agreement
also
in
the
district
court,
and
we
brought
a
question
of
fact
to
the
district
court.
when
the
district
court
first
sent
this
back
to
the
arbitrator,
it
went
through
and
basically
told
the
arbitrator:
you
know,
you
haven't
looked
at
these
facts;
you
haven't
looked
at
these
fact;
you
haven't
looked
at
these
facts.
i
believe
it's
pet.
app.
57a.
and
it
sent
it
back
to
show
the
arbitrator's
work.
i
mean
that
is
what--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--courts
would
get
mired
in
under
a
common
law
development
standard
of
review,
according
to
what--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
does.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
that
perhaps
as
i
should
be,
but
i
know--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
they're
very
different
policies
and
different
statutory
frameworks
that
apply.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
there
has
not
been
widespread
use
of
this
provision.
i
think
that
our
amici
briefs
really
speak
to
this,
your
honor,
because
the
difference
would
be
a
statement
by
the
u.s.
supreme
court
that
says
parties
can
now
create
whatever
other
grounds
they
want
and
go
in
through
section
9
in
a
streamlined
process
and
are
going
to
impose
on
federal
courts,
not
appellate
arbitrators,
on
federal
courts,
whatever
grounds
they
want...
de
novo
review
of
fact,
no
harmless
error,
perhaps
create
different
appellate
standards
when
it
goes
up.
and
i
think
that
the
amici
really
point
out
that
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
finality
and
efficiencies
that
the
animal
of
arbitration--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
it
would
create
a
hybrid
animal
that
is
not
what
the
arbitration
act
is
about.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
with
all
due
respect--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that
would
be
for
congress
to
do,
not
this
court.
this
is
a
statutory
framework,
a
statutory
cause
of
action
that
congress
wrote.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
but
you're
putting...
you
are,
i
think,
as
this
court
itself
has
said,
you're
breeding
litigation
from
a
statute
whose
whole
point
was
to
minimize
and
limit
litigation.
you're
creating
a
new
body
of
federal
common
law
that's
really
antithetical
to
the
core
purpose
of
the
arbitration
act.
and
i
think
that
the...
that
overriding
principle
of
federal
arbitration
act
should
really
motivate
the
court
to
realize
what
congress
did
and
the
exclusive
grounds
that
they
set
forth.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
the
severability
point
that
they
lost
on,
your
honor.
they
had
petitioned
for
cert
on
severability
and
tried
to
say
because
the
judicial
review
became
legally
impossible
the
rest
should
have
followed.
we'd
be
arguing
a
different
case.
they
petitioned
for
rehearing
en
banc
review
on
that
and
did
not
petition
for
cert
on
that.
but
that
is
answered
by
the
severability
ruling
below.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
in
court?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
an
arbitration
agreement.
i'm
not
sure
what
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
hesitate
because
it
sounds
like
that
may
just
be
an
advisory
opinion,
and
there
might
be
an
article
iii
problem
with
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
then
they
can
go
and
have--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
they
have
a
declaratory
judgment,
then
they'll
have
a
judgment.
i
don't
know
why
they
would
ever
go
back
to
the
arbitrator.
that's
what
i'm
not--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
don't
see
how
that
is
inconsistent
with
a
party
independently
going
for
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
i
don't
think
that's
contrary
to
our
position,
your
honor.
thank
you.
