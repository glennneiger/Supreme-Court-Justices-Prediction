justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
are
there
not
such
things
as
nonbinding
arbitration's?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
in
effect
say
that
when
we're
done
the
district
court
will
do
it
as
an
original
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i'm
just
not
following
this
discussion.
does
it
assume
that
you
can
bring
an
action
on
the
contract
and
just
bypass
the
provision
of
the
contract
which
says
there
will
be
arbitration?
how
can
you
do
that?
you...
you
don't
assert
you
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
clearly
can't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
somebody
has
to
decide
on
this
arbitration
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this...
but
this
one
isn't,
and
if
we
say
that
you
lose
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
is
it
open
to
the
state
court
to
say,
well,
that's
what
the
federal
arbitration
act
says,
but
we
handle
arbitration
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
if
you
lose
on
the
arbitration
here,
you've
got
to
lose
on
the
arbitration
before
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
admit
that.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is,
indeed,
the
issue.
what
we're
arguing
about
here
is
whether
9
and
10
are
simply
default
rules
that
apply
where
the
parties
have
not
otherwise
specified.
that's...
and
that's,
arguably,
what
the
new
york
law
and
the
illinois...
i...
i
don't
know
that
any
of
those
cases
cited
by
the
other
side
involved
cases
where
the
illinois
rule
or
the
new
york
rule
was
applied
in
the
teeth
of
an
arbitration
agreement
that
said
something
differently.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
i
think
both
the
illinois
rule
and
the
new
york
rule
were
default
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
arguing
that
this
is
the
default
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
about
the
fact
that
our
opinions
have
said
that
there
is
another
ground
under
10,
which
is
manifest
miscarriage
of
justice?
that's
not
listed
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
did
we
go...
go
to
the
trouble
of
expressing
it
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not
just
say
section
4?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
happen
in
situations
like
this?
suppose
we
agree
with
you;
and
we
say,
oh,
yes,
both
of
the
parties
agreed
as
part
of
this
contract:
i
don't
want
to
let
these
arbitrators
decide
the
law.
if
they
get
the
law
wrong,
we
want...
we
want
the
courts
to
decide
the
law.
that's
the
deal.
and
then
you're
going
to
say,
oh,
that
portion
of
the
contract
is
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
such
thing
as...
as
failure
of
the
contract
for
a
misunderstanding
of
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think...
you
think
the
state
can
enforce
an
arbitration
award
that
would
not
be
enforceable
under
the
faa?
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
we
agree
with
you
that
this
is
a
quick
and
dirty
way
to
get
arbitration
agreements
enforced
if
you
want
to
bring
it
within
9
and
10,
and
if
you
don't,
you're
free
not
to;
you
can
go
to
the
state
courts.
why
can't
he
still
go
to
the
state
courts?
you
say
this
is
going
to
terminate
the
litigation.
is
this
going
to
be
res
judicata
on
anything?
all
it's
going
to
say
is
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
this.
it's
not
under
9
and
10.
you're
going
to
run
off
to
state
court.
you're
going
to
protract
the
litigation
rather
than
bring
it
to
a
quick
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
the
old
illinois
and
the
old
new
york
rules,
you
don't
have
any
cases
which
say...
which
establish
that
those
rules
were
not
just
default
rules,
but
you...
but
you
were
not
allowed
to
depart
from
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't...
you
don't
have
any
case
that
holds
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
case
that
holds
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
couldn't
you
limit
it
reasonably
by
saying
the
parties
can
agree
to
anything?
we
would
only
have
to
say
at
least,
the
parties
can
at
least
agree
to
anything
that
the
court
would
be
able
to
do
if
this
had
been
brought
as
an
action
in
the
court,
rather
than
initially
as
an
arbitration.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
the
court
would
decide
the
questions
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
that
would
be
a
limit.
you
say
it's
limitless.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
limitless.
justice
antonin
scalia
remind
me
why
section
9
doesn't
get
you
there...
because
of
the
"if"
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
parties
in
their
agreement
have
agreed
that
a
judgment
of
a
court
shall
be
entered
upon
the
award
made
pursuant
to...
but
they
have
agreed
to
that,
haven't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
simply--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is,
why
is
that
condition
excluded
from
the
10
are
not
excluded
from
the
"if"
clause?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
"if"
clause
must
embrace
any
conditions.
