doesn't
the
arbitration
agreement
in
this
case
set
out
a
standard
of
review
and
say
on
findings
of
fact
they
have
to
be
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
agree
on
condition
and
the
conditions
are
satisfied,
are
you
saying
that
the
district
court
must
enforce
under
section
9,
or
are
you
saying
that
enforcement
would
be
under
some
other
authority?
