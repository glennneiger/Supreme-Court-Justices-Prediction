justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
that
point...
the
reason
i
think
you're...
there's
a
little
chaos
here
is
because
you
said...
your
question
is
phrased,
does
the
faa
preclude
enforcement
of
your
arbitration
agreement?
and
you're
going
to
say:
we
answer
that
question,
no,
it
doesn't
preclude
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
require
it;
it
doesn't
preclude
it.
but
then
would
we
have
to
go
back
and
say
what
is
the
source?
there
has
to
be
some
source
of
law
that
authorizes
this
contractual
agreement,
and
there
could
be
two
possible
sources.
and
my
question
here
is,
is
it
clear
that
in
fact
either
of
these
two
sources
does?
the
first
source
is
state
law.
i
gather
the
difficulty
is
that
the
state
of
oregon
has
an
act
just
like
the
federal
arbitration
act,
so
we'd
have
to
ask
the
oregon
courts:
is
this
a
legitimate
contract
under
oregon
state
law.
the
alternative
source
of
law
is
the
federal
judge's
case
management
authority.
and
there
we
have
a
statute
which
clearly
gives
the
judge
some
kind
of
authority,
but
not
for
your
case
because
your
case
exceeds
the
jurisdictional
amount.
therefore,
in
the
absence
of
that
statute,
is
there
inherent
authority
in
the
district
judge?
now,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
either
of
those
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
temptation
is
to
say
they're
open
questions
and
they'd
have
to
be
argued
on
remand,
which
makes
this
case
the
case
of
the
century,
i
guess,
in
a
certain
respect.
it's
quite
a
difficult
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
in
a
certain
area.
i
overstate.
but
the...
is
there
any
light
you
can
shed
on
those
two
questions,
or
is
there
some
third
possible
source
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
argued
that
this
is
a
matter
governed
by
oregon
law
and
it
is
enforceable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
ever
argued
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
under
oregon
law.
have
you
ever
argued
oregon
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
it's
not
surprising
they
haven't
argued
that
oregon
law
doesn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
just
what
you
said
is
actually
what's
worrying
me
about
the
case.
because
what
justice
ginsburg
said
makes
me
think
that
there
could
be
situations,
a
lot
of
situations,
where
federal
judges
do
want
to
peel
the
case
off.
and
you
say
send
it
to
a
master.
maybe
some
would
lend
themselves
to
a
master;
maybe
some
wouldn't.
i
have
no
idea.
and
are
we
going
to
have
to
hold
in
this
case
whether
a
judge
or
when
a
judge,
a
federal
judge,
does
or
does
not
have
authority
to
do
such
a
thing?
that's
why
i
say...
i
was
actually
thinking
the
case
of
the
century,
because
it's
going
to
take
a
hundred
years
to
finish.
but
the
fact
is
there
are
those
issues
there
once
we
say
section
9
doesn't
apply.
then
you're
going
to
have
to
say...
suppose
we
were
to
say
it's
just
state
law.
well,
suppose
the
state
doesn't
allow
enforcement
of
this
kind
of
contract?
then
we
have
the
question
of
the
authority...
of
the
inherent
authority,
not
statutory,
of
a
federal
district
judge
to
peel
off
bits
of
cases
and
decide
them
in
different
ways.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
those
questions,
but
i
think
they
are
quite
important.
so
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
because
there
is
a
holding
in
the
whole
ninth
circuit,
which
accounts
for
a
large
percent
of
the
country,
that
the
district
judge
can't
do
this.
and
that's
quite
a
significant
holding
in
that
circuit,
and
we
ought
to
review
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
if
there
is,
then
let's
think...
suppose
that
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
the
parties
say,
judge,
this
is
so
complicated
factually,
we
have
a
way
that
we
can
get
an
agreed
statement
of
facts.
they
walk
out
the
door;
they
have
a
friend
who
has
a
sign
called
arbitrator;
and
they
come
away
from
that
friend
with
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,
which
they
agree
to
submit
to
the
judge
to
apply
the
law.
now,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that,
i
imagine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
know...
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
even
going
to
tell
the
judge
how
i
find
this.
i
go
to
a
crystal
ball;
i
go
to
any
way
i
want.
i
will
come
in
with
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,
and
is
there
anything,
if
we
have
that
agreed
statement
of
facts,
that
would
will
stop
the
judge
from
saying
i
take
this
agreed
statement
of
facts;
there's
a
difference
about
how
the
law
applies
to
it;
i
will
resolve
this
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
no...
i
just
say...
well,
i'll
ask
you
the
next
question.
i
take
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
that,
if
in
fact
parties
come
in
with
an
agreed
statement
of
fact
in
a
case,
i've
never
seen
a
situation
where
the
judge
couldn't
say,
fine,
i
agree;
that's
the...
the
judge
would
say
i'm
sorry,
even
though
you
agree,
i
insist
that
you
go
to
trial
and?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
there
are
public
policy
limitations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
anything
wrong
here?
my
question
basically,
obviously,
is,
is
there
anything
wrong
in
this
case
if
they
had
come
in
with
an
agreed
statement
of
fact?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
my
question;
i'm
not
asking
it
very
well.
what
they
agreed
to
is
an
agreed
statement
of
facts,
subject
to
section
9
standards,
section
9
and
10.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
driving
at,
whether
i've
asked
it
well
or
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
is
how
is
it
any
different
from
coming
in
with
an
agreed
statement
of
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
has
that
been
a
nightmare...
has
it
been
the
nightmare
you
suggest
in
labor
arbitration?
because
i
think
labor
arbitration
falls
outside
the
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
has
that
turned
into
some
kind
of
terrible
nightmare
where
there
are
dozens
of
rules
and
they
have
a
long
complicated
labor
set
of
regulations
on
it?
i
don't
think
so,
but
has
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
we
run
that
pretty
well,
why
wouldn't
you
run
this
pretty
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--given
a
back-up,
looking
at
it
as
a
default?
