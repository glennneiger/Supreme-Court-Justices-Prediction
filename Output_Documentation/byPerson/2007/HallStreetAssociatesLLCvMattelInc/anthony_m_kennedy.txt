justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
some...
one
of
the
functions
of
a
judicial...
what
about
an
agreement,
arbitration
agreement,
that
the
district
court
can
find
facts
de
novo?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it's
a
complex
matter
of
monitoring
emissions,
looking
at
water
quality,
and
the
arbitrator
has
to
sit
by
the
river
for
a
month,
the
district
judge
had
to
go
down
and
sit
by
the
river
for
a
month.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
to
give
us
a
standard.
you
said,
you
mentioned,
oh,
functions
of
the
district
court.
i
don't
know
the
standard
you're
proposing
that
will
allow
us
to
draw
the
line
and
to
put
cases
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other.
you
said,
well,
you
can't
interfere
with
the
functions
of
the
court.
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
streamlined
process
is
the
only
process.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
purpose
of
the
arbitration
act
is
to
promote
confidence
in
the
arbitration
process,
that
if
parties
agree
to
have
the
double
assurance
that
the
arbitrator
hasn't
made
some
strange
ruling
of
law,
that
that's
quite
consistent
with
the
whole
purposes
of
arbitration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
interpret
the
statute;
and
let
us
assume
that
it's
a
plausible
interpretation
and
interpret
the
statute
as
the
petitioner
would.
you
know,
under
section
8,
the
parties
can
use
the
authority
of
the
court
to
libel
a
ship.
the
court
is
extending
its
authority
to...
to
use
very
intrusive
means,
and
to
say
that
the
parties
can't
ensure,
if
they
choose,
to
have
review
for
correct
errors
of
law...
to
correct
errors
of
law
when
the
ship
has
been
seized,
it
seems
to
me
to
promote
the
whole
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
arguing
about
that
textually.
i'm
saying
that
there's
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
petitioner's
position
and
the
basic
policies
of
the
act.
you
talk
about
finality,
streamline,
and
so
forth;
but
if
the
parties
have
more
confidence
in
the
arbitration
process
by
ensuring
this
added
level
of
review,
it
seems
to
me
quite
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you...
would
you
agree
that
what
we
hold
in
this
case
applies
to
suits
in
admiralty,
where
you
don't
go
to
state
court
under
section
8?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
this
point
you
don't
have
a
state
court
fallback
for
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
can't
say
why
it
isn't...
i
just
repeat
my
earlier
point...
quite
consistent
with
encouraging
confidence
in
admiralty
arbitration
to
allow
district
courts
to
review
rulings
on
a
matter
of
law
if
the
parties
so
choose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
would
add--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
would
add
that
in
admiralty
you
don't
have
the
back-up
of
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
parties
have
an
arbitration
agreement
in
which
they
said,
if
there
are
contested
issues
of
law,
either
party
may
seek
declaratory
judgment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
federal
court,
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
hypothetical
is
it's
in
the
arbitration
agreement.
if
the
arbitrator
gets
stuck
on
a
difficult
question
of
law,
either
party
can
seek
declaratory
relief,
and
the
arbitration
proceedings
are
held
in
abeyance
pending
that
declaration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
there's
the
advisory...
we've
been
through
this.
this
is
a
real
controversy,
not
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
the
reason
you
hesitated
to
answer
yes
might
be
inconsistent
with
your
position.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
lots
of
other
things
for
the
arbitrator
to
do.
he's
got
some
specific
issues
of
law
that
are
contested.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
why
you
have
to
give
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
justice
alito,
if
what
you
told
justice
scalia
is
correct,
that
the
"if"
clause
includes
the
condition
that
the
court
reviewed
for
issues...
for
errors
of
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
but
you're
arguing
to
justice
scalia
that
section
9
works
because
you
could
interpret
the
"if"
clause
that
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
telling
justice
scalia,
oh,
well,
it's
a
different
action.
we
have
got
the
action
here
anyway.
