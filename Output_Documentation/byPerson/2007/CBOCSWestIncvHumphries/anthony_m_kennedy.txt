justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
mean
patterson
would
come
out
the
same
under
1981
as
amended
by
the
1991
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
congress
would
have
been
quite
amazed
at
that
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
congress
changed
that
and
the
case
we
have
is
also
post
formation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
would
harassment
be
prohibited
by
1981
as
amended?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
term
1981(b).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
practice
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
this
area--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--perhaps
you
can
maybe
just
tell
me
based
on
your
experience:
after
1981
was
amended,
did
1981(b)
supersede
title
vii
in
run
of
the
mill
termination
and
harassment
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
not
retaliation.
i
mean
harassment,
discharge,
et
cetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
not?
there's
a
longer
statute
of
limitation.
there's
no
cap
on
damages.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
i
have
to
refine
the
hypothetical.
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much,
but
in
federal
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
congress
told
us:
we
don't
care
if
there's
an
overlap
between
1981
and
title
vii,
we
don't
care
if
there's
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
we
don't
care
if
there's
no
cap
an
damages;
we
want
1981
to
work.
and
that's...
1981
does
apply
in
a
large
number
of
employment
discrimination
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that's
true,
then
why
do
we
worry
about
retaliation?
if
congress
is
not
concerned
about
it,
why
should
we
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
it's
clear,
but
neither
you
or
the
government
seems
to
tell
me
any
words
in
this
statute.
your
argument
is
that
we
should
create
a
cause
of
action
in
order
to
make
this
effective.
i
understand
that
argument.
i
think
the
court's
cases
stand
against
it,
and
if
you
want
to...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
admitting
that
nothing
in
the
words
of
the
statute
as
amended
help
you.
and
the
government...
which
as
well
is
an
impairment,
which
i
think
is
quite
wrong
because
that's
not
what
section
(c}
intended
for.
but
that's
almost
an
admission
on
the
government's
part
that
it
can't
find
any
words
in
section
(b)
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
there
before...
but
that
was
there
as
of
the
time
of
patterson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
congress
did
nothing
by
the
amendment
to
help
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
patterson
was
not
a
retaliation
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
patterson
was
a
discharge
and
harassment
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
words
do
seem
to
cover
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
nothing
that
you
argued
so
far
shows
that
the
words
of
the
statute
as
amended,
that
is
to
say
new
subsection
(b),
help
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
do
not
read
subsection
(c)
as
giving
substantive
rights.
i
mean,
you
can
argue
about
that.
i
think
you
have
to
talk
about
(b),
and
i
think
you
have
a
valid
point
when
they
say
that
they're
extending
the
protection
for
the
life
of
the
contract.
but
i
still
want
to
know
what
particular
words
in
section
(b)
you
rely
on?
"benefit"?
"privilege"?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it's
ironic
to
say
all
those
cases
were
wrong
when
congress
agreed
with
them
and
disagreed
with
patterson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
true
in
sullivan
because
a
property
owner
who
wants
to
sell
is
in
a
particularly
advantageous
position
to
enforce
the
rights
of
the
buyer.
it's
part
of
his
own
contract.
and
to
extend
it
to
the
situation
we
have
here
is
quite
an
extension
of
sullivan
in
my
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
i'm...
what
i'm
taking
away
from
the
argument
is
that
if
i
were
to
write
this
opinion
in
your
favor,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it's
necessary
to
imply
a
cause
of
action
prohibiting
retaliation
in
order
to
make
these
other
words
effective.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
limited
argument
and
a
very
difficult
argument
for
you
to
prevail
upon,
given
the
authorities
and
the
approach
of
the
court
that
we've
discussed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
and...
and
there
certainly
is
a
cause
of
action
as
to
all
the
terms
in
the
contract,
but
you
want
to
add...
for
me
to
add
a
new
term.
you
can't
use
the
existing
terms
to
say
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
other...
that
helps
your
client,
other
than
that
there
is
a
general
approach
that
there
is
protection
post
contract
formation.
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that;
and
i
don't
think
you
can
get
out
of
it
impairment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
making
enforcement,
as
with
patterson.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
you're
just
talking
about
make
or
enforce
and
that
brings
us
right
back
to
where
we
started.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
asking
us
to
infer,
to
find
implied
in
the
words
a
cause
of
action
against
retaliation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
words--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
words
in
the
statute?
and
not
"impairment"
because
i
don't
agree
with
the
government
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
third
reason
is
that
the
word
isn't
in
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
a
benefit,
privilege,
and
term
of
the
contract--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
me
fairly
obvious
to
me
to
include
harassment.
that
was
the
situation
in
patterson.
that's
what
congress
sought
to
address.
retaliation
is
something
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
were
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--talking
about
impairment
in
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
and
you
in
your
brief
bracketed
that
and
just
made
that
equivalent
to
retaliation.
i
don't
think
it
is
because
he
was
arguing
that
he
didn't...
he
was
himself
injured
because
he
couldn't
sell
his
own
property.
he
has
an
interest
in
his
own
property.
and
that
just
isn't
true
in
the
standard
retaliation
case
of
the
type
we're
discussing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
a
seller
is...
or
a
would
be
seller
is
always
a
built
in
advocate
for
a
buyer
if
some
third
person
interferes
with
the
contract.
