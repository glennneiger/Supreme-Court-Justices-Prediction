ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
the
questions
that
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
raised
about
the
effectiveness
of
section
1981
if
there
is
no
right
to
bring
an
action
for
retaliation.
section
1981
doesn't
provide
any
specific
remedies
or
any
type
of
enforcement
mechanism.
it
can
only
be
enforced
through
a
private
lawsuit.
petitioner's
basically
asking
this
court
to
allow
an
employer
to
be
able
to
fire
an
employee
who
brought
a
private
lawsuit
to
enforce
his
section
1981
rights.
if
the
court
were
to
allow
employers
to
do
that,
then
any
employer
or
contracting
party
would
have
the
ability
to
exempt
themselves
from
section
1981
liability.
take
the
example
of
a
person
who
complains
that
he
was
not
promoted
because
of
his
race
in
violation
of
section
1981.
his
employer
fires
him
for
making
that
complaint.
if
he
did
not
have
protection
under
section
1981
against
retaliation,
he
would
never
have
the
opportunity
to
remedy
that
discriminatory
promotion.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
they
would
in
fact
have
a
cause
of
action,
justice
scalia.
but
this
court--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--this
court
held
in
the
jackson
case
that
discrimination
on
the
basis...
that
retaliation
when
there
was
a
complaint
about
sex
discrimination
constituted
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
so
it
follows
that
here
under
section
1981
if
someone
makes
a
complaint
about
race
discrimination
and
they
are
retaliated
against
that
they
are
being
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
race.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
well,
that's
what
the
court
held
in
jackson,
your
honor.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
there's
a
lot
of
reasons
to
bring
a
title
vii
action,
your
honor.
title
vii
allows
an
employee
to
go
to
the
eeoc,
and
the
eeoc
has
a
lot
of
advantages.
and
so
you
can
bring
both
a
title
vii
and
a
section
1981
claim.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
congress
said
specifically
in...
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act
that
the
damage
caps
do
not
apply
if
an
employee
has
a
right
under
section
1981
and
so--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--well...
and
we
do
have
the
right
that's
at
issue
here
today,
because--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--title
vii
damages
were
added,
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
were
added,
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
right.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
absolutely--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
and
congress
clearly
made
that...
made
that
choice.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
the
words
in
the
statute
that
provide
the
basis
for
this
claim
is
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
same
rights
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
white
citizens.
and
this
court
has
consistently
interpreted
that
to
mean--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
what
the
court
did
to
help
our
case
was
that
after
patterson
was
decided
and
before
the
section...
before
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
was
passed,
the
lower
courts
had
interpreted
patterson
to
restrict
retaliation
claims
because
they
generally
involve
post
formation
conduct.
and
what
congress
made
clear
in
the...
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991
is
that
they
wanted
to
have
protection
throughout
the
entire
contractual
relationship.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
absolutely
right,
justice--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--they
consistently
thought
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
based
upon
sullivan.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
the
words
of
the
statute
that
help
us
establish
the
cause
of
action
are
that
it
made...
that
congress
made
clear
that
the
entire
contractual
relationship
would
be
covered
from
the
beginning
of
the
contractual
relationship
through
the
end,
through
termination.
and
coupling
that
with
the
original
words
of
the
statute
that
lower
courts
had
interpreted
to
allow
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
and
with
subsection
(c),
which
uses
broader
language,
it
says
"impairment
by
discrimination"...
under
this
court's
holding
in
jackson--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--any
of
those
could
apply,
justice
kennedy.
but
the...
what
congress
was
legislating
against
was
this
court's
restriction
in
patterson
and
saying
that
the
rights
that
are
protected
are
only
those
rights
at
the
making
of
the
contract
and
the
enforcement
of
the
contract.
and
they
expanded
the
language
to
cover
the
entire
contractual
relationship.
so
that,
for
example,
here
where
you
have
a
termination
caused
by
retaliation,
then
you
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
under
the
statute.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
patterson
said
you
were
wrong.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
there
were--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--they
based
that
on...
on
this
court's
reading
in
sullivan.
and
sullivan
interpreted
the
companion
statute
to
section
1981,
which
was
section
1982.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that
respectfully,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
say
here,
when
you
have
the
person
who
was
the
victim
of
the
discrimination,
who
was
also,
who
was
complaining
about
the
discrimination
and
then
gets
fired,
he's
in
actually
a
better
position
than
the
white
homeowner
was
in
sullivan.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
those
statutes--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--the
word
"retaliation".
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--does
not
appear
in...
in
those.
there's
actually
very
few
federal
statutes
where
the
actual
word
"retaliation"
appears.
but
the
other
statutes
that--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--they
do,
but
there
is
no
specific
cause
of
action
provided
in
section
1981
at
all.
and
this
court
has
already
held
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
section
1981,
and
what
we're
asking--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--i
think
you
give
effect
to
sullivan
in
this
situation,
and
the
reason
is
because
at
the
time
that
congress
was
legislating
and
amending
section
1981,
and
it
was
acting
against
the
backdrop
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
it
had
patterson
in
front
of
it,
it
had...
it
knew
that
sullivan
was
still
good
law.
it
knew
that
this
court
had
repeatedly
directed
that
section
1981
and
section
1982
be
construed
similarly;
and
patterson
did
not
address
the
specific
situation
that
was
in
sullivan,
that
is
whether
you
could
bring
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
that's
correct.
but--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--if
they
were
legislating
on
a
clean
slate
i
might
agree
with
that
justice...
chief
justice
roberts.
but
in
this
situation
they
were
not
legislating
on
a
clean
slate.
what
they
were
doing
was
amended
one
of
the
oldest
civil
rights
acts
in
this
country,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
and
given
that
they
were
going
to
amend
that
law
and
they
amended
it
based
upon
what
this
court
had
said
in
patterson,
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances
it...
they
wouldn't
necessarily
go
and
create
and
write
a
reticulated
statute
such
as
the
modern
antidiscrimination
statutes
are.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily
true.
i
think
they...
they
legislated
against
the
backdrop
both
of
sullivan
and
the
lower
courts'
consistent
recognition
of
a
cause
of
action.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
i
wouldn't
necessarily
agree
with
that,
justice
alito.
i
would--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg;
and
at
that
time
this
court
said
that
you
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
there
in
title
ix
the
language
was
broad.
it
was
a
general
ban
on
discrimination,
such
as
we
have
in
section
1981
and
section
1982,
and
in
fact
the
jackson
court
relied
on
sullivan
and
relied
on
this
court's
interpretation
of
sullivan
to
find
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation
under
title
ix.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
well,
the
court
has
already
implied
a
cause
of
action
and
the
question
is
whether--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--well,
the
language
in
this
statute
that
guarantees
the
same
rights
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
by
citizens
provides
that
basis,
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
jackson.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
but...
subsection
(b)
defines
make
and
enforce
more
broadly.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
language
in
section
1981(d),
that
was
to
make
clear
that
the
terms
make
and
enforce
contracts
cover
the
entire
contractual
relationship,
from
the
beginning
of
the
relationship
to
the
end
of
it.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
and
i
know
there
is
some
disagreement
about
that,
but
the
court
in
jackson
found
that...
it
did
find
that
sullivan
did
stand
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation.
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
well,
if
you
look
at
what
sullivan
actually
said,
chief
justice
roberts,
i
think
you
would
find
that
you
could
read
it
more
expansively
that
just
a
third
party
standing
case.
in
that
case
the
white
lessor,
mr.
sullivan,
had
been
expelled
from
the
corporation
after
he
advocated
the
rights
of
his
black
lessee,
mr.
freeman;
and
he
was
allowed
under...
the
court
allowed
him
to
bring
his
action
to
recover
damages
and
get
injunctive
relief,
because
he
himself
was
expelled
from
that
corporation.
so
he
was
the
person
that
had
an
had
injury
in
that
circumstance.
so
i
think
that
it's
not--
ms.
cynthia
h.
hyndman
--the...
the
court
says
that
mr.
sullivan
does
have
standing
to
bring
the
action.
i
do
agree
with
that,
but
if
you
read
the
entire
opinion,
you
would
see
that
they
also
say
that
mr.
sullivan
had
the
right
to
bring
his
action
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief.
just
to
sum
up,
because
this
court
in
sullivan
and
jackson
has
recognized
that
persons
who
themselves
were
not
victims
of
discrimination
must
be
protected
against
retaliation
when
they
advocate
the
rights
of
those
victims;
otherwise
the
underlying
discrimination
would
go
unchecked...
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
do
anything
here
that
they
haven't
already
done.
we
are
just
asking
that
the
victim
of
the
discrimination
here,
mr.
humphries,
have
the
same
protection
against
retaliation
that
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
his
advocate
would
have.
thank
you.
