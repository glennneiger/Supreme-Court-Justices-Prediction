justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happens
in
just
a
basic
employment
case?
i'm
trying
to
remember
from
law
school.
somebody's
contract
with
another
man,
he's
the
employee,
and
he
says...
the
employer
says:
i'm
firing
you
because
you
won't
help
me
rob
the
bank.
or
the
employee
goes
and
he
finds
some
money
in
a
wallet
or
something
on
the
street,
and
he
says,
i'm
going
to
return
it
to
the
rightful
owner,
and
the
employer
says,
i
hate
rightful
owners,
so
i'm
firing
you.
now,
when
the
employee
goes
to
court,
i
take
it...
my
vague
recollection
is
the
employer
can't
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
law,
is
there
some
kind
of
policy
against
that
from
the
state
law,
he
couldn't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
we
have
a
federal
statute
that
says
that
a
black
person
shall
have
the
same
right
to
make
a
contract
as
a
white
person.
but
if
nobody
ever
can
report
on
that,
that
they're
not,
it's
not
going
to
be
the
same
right;
it's
going
to
be
zero
right.
so,
why
by
parity
of
reasoning
wouldn't
this
provide
for
the
same
kind
of
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no.
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
you're
a
thief
in
my
example,
whether
you're
good
hearted.
it
doesn't
matter
who
you
are.
you
could
even
be
somebody
from
another
country.
you
don't
have
to
be
american.
you
could
be
anything.
but
the
state
law
tries
to
follow
out
that...
that
policy
of
not
having
bank
robberies
and
of
returning
money
to
rightful
owners.
well,
here
we
have
a
federal
policy,
and
the
federal
policy
is
that
black
people
shall
be
treated
the
same
as
white
in
respect
to
making
a
contract.
but
were
the
law
to
allow
you
to
fire
anybody
who
complained
about
it,
then
black
people
wouldn't
have
that
right.
and
therefore
the
policy
is
that
you
can't
do
it
under
this
statute
because
otherwise
the
written
policy
is
ineffective.
i'm
just
remembering
that
from
my
written...
from
my
policy
arguments
that
were
in
contract
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
anywhere,
by
the
way,
in
that
statute
that
a
black
person
who
is
discriminated
against
can
go
to
court
and
file
a
lawsuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
does
it
say
is
in
that
statute,
1981?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
have
we
developed
a
policy
here
in
creating
a
right
of
action
under
this
1981?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
is
the
statute
that
does...
is
there
a
statute
that
specifically
gives
you
a
right
to
sue
under
1981?
is
there
a
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
established
it.
yes,
that's
my
point:
that
the
federal
court
implied
from
the
statute
a
right
of
action.
now,
if
they're
implying
a
right
of
action
from
the
statute,
why
wouldn't
courts
also
imply
those
rights
of
action
necessary
to
make
the
statute
effective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
the
word
i
was
looking
for.
the
word
i
was
looking
for
in
1981(a)
is
the
word
"and
can
bring
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court.
"
i
don't
see
that
written
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
correct.
so
we've
implied
that.
and
therefore,
if
i
can
imply
that,
why
can't
we
imply
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
those
who
need
the
lawsuit
to
make
the
right
effective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
my
basic
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
because
the
legislative
history
does
say,
when
they
passed
this,
that
the
new
law
will
involve
a
claim,
allow
them
to
make
a
claim
of
harassment,
discharge,
promotion,
transfer,
retaliation,
and
hiring.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
they
write
that
in
the
house
report,
isn't
that
some
evidence
that
they
did
look
back
and
see
sullivan,
and
they
did
think
that
in
1982
there's
a
retaliation
action,
and
therefore
in
1981
there
is
one?
isn't
there
at
least
evidence
that
there
were
people
in
congress
thinking
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
someone--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
think
we're
familiar
with
that
debate.
but
if
we
can
look...
look
at
the
statute,
if
i
ask
you
why
isn't
this
an
enjoyment
of
a
benefit,
a
privilege
or
term
or
a
condition
of
the
contract,
is
your
answer
that
this
was
an
at
will
contract?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
because
i
don't
think
that's
is
a
good
argument.
why
isn't
this
a
benefit
or
a
privilege
that's
been
denied?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
the
rationale
of
those
cases...
and
it's
important
to
get
the
right
rationale.
if
i
say
this
and
i'm
wrong
tell
me
i'm
wrong.
and
i
thought
that
the
heart
of
it
is
not
that
the
retaliated...
the
act
of
retaliation
is
discrimination.
it
isn't.
what
they
say
is
when
the
white
man
helps
the
black
man
from
being
discriminated
against,
it
falls
within
the
statute,
not
because
you've
discriminated
against
the
black
man,
but
because
if
it
didn't
fall
within
the
statute
it
would
seriously
erode
or
destroy
the
black
man's
right.
that's
what
it
seemed
to
me
douglas
said
in
sullivan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
then
we're
looking
very
hard
in
a
place
for
a
word
that
couldn't
be
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
long
standing
civil
rights
law,
42
u.s.c.
section
1981,
first
enacted
after
the
civil
war,
provides,
"all
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
same
right
in
every
state
and
territory
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
as
is
--
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.”
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
provision
i
just
read,
encompasses
a
complaint
of
retaliation
against
a
person,
say
a
white
person,
who
himself
has
complained
about
contract
related
discrimination
against
another
person,
say
a
black
person,
kind
of
--
he's
a
kind
of
whistle
blower.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
statute
did
protect
against
this
form
of
retaliation
and
the
petitioner
here
challenges
that
conclusion.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
circuit
is
wrong.
it
says
that
a
white
man,
though
retaliated
against,
is
not
being
discriminated
against
because
of
his
or
her
race.
it
adds
that
the
statute
simply
assures
each
person
the
same
right
to
make
contracts
that
is,
in
the
statutes'
words,
enjoyed
by
white
citizens.
a
white
person
enjoys
that
right.
he
acts
as
nothing
more
and
the
act
consequently
does
not
protect
those
who
speak
up
about
or
act
against
the
racial
discrimination
that
it
forbids.
now,
we
reject
this
argument
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
we
rest
our
conclusion
primarily
upon
principles
of
stare
decisis,
principles
that
warn
us
against
departing
from
a
well-established
prior
interpretation
of
the
law.
and
there
is
that
interpretation
in
all
the
arguments
against
the
argument
i
just
gave
are
in
all
those
cases.
in
1969
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
the
court
found
that
sullivan,
a
white
man,
did
have
standing
to
maintain
a
suit
against
a
property
association
that
punished
him
when
he
protested
its
discriminatory
treatment
against
a
black
man.
sullivan
concerned
a
sister
statute
involving
property
rights
rather
than
contract
rights
which
are
now
before
us,
but
in
a
later
case,
jackson
v.
birmingham,
the
court
made
clear
that
sullivan
stood
for
the
proposition
that
that
property
statute
prohibited
retaliation
against
those
who
advocate
the
rights
of
groups
whom
the
statute
protects
and
the
long
line
of
our
precedence
then
treats
the
statute
now
before
us
and
the
statue
in
the
sullivan,
the
contract
and
the
property
statute,
similarly
because
they
are
sister
statutes,
as
they
said
they
have
similar
language,
common
history,
and
shared
anti-discrimination
purposes.
we
have
to
concede
that
in
a
still
later
case,
patterson
versus
mclean
credit
union,
this
court
narrowed
the
interpretation
of
section
1981,
narrowed
it
in
--
in
contrast
with
the
broader
interpretation
that
many
lower
courts
had
previously
followed
and
in
patterson,
the
court
set
forth
an
interpretation
that
in
practice
would
have
ruled
out
many
retaliation
claims.
the
congress
later
responded
with
amendments
to
section
1981
and
those
amendments
sought
to
broaden
the
statute's
scope.
in
our
view,
congress
intended
those
amendments
in
the
language
of
the
reports
of
the
–
on
the
bill
to
restore
rights
to
sue
for
retaliatory
conduct.
in
a
word,
the
history
of
the
statute,
which
we
consider
at
greater
length
in
our
opinion,
convinces
us
that
an
interpretation
of
section
1981
as
offering
protection
against
retaliation
has
been
the
law
for
some
time.
for
reasons
we
also
set
forth,
we
do
not
find
in
the
petitioner's
argument
sufficient
basis
for
departing
from
prior
interpretations.
so
we
affirm
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
