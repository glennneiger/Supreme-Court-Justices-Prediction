mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
already
inferred
a
private
cause
of
action
under
section
1981.
so
the
question
before
the
court
now
is
simply
the
scope
of
the
basic
guarantee
in
section
1981
and
particularly
whether
it
prohibits
retaliation
against
someone
who
exercised
their
undoubted
right
to
complain
about
racial
discrimination
in
a
contractual
process.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
justice
scalia,
we're
not
asking
to
you
to
go
back
to
the
bad
old
days.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
we
are
simply
asking
you
to
interpret
the
scope
of
the
cause
of
action
you've
already
inferred.
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
way
this
court
has
approached
1981
cases.
patterson
would
be
a
great
example.
this
court
in
patterson
didn't
say,
are
we
going
to
infer
a
new
cause
of
action
for
harassment?
no.
this
court
interpreted
the
basic
prohibition
of
1981
and
said
it
didn't
cover
harassment.
we
think
if
you
interpret
the
basic
prohibitions
in
1981,
it
covers
retaliation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
patterson
was
1989.
i
don't
think
anybody
thinks
patterson
was
the
bad
old
days.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
bad
old
days
ended
when
you
got
on
the
court,
mr.
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
now,
i
think
the
considerations
of
precedent
as
well
speak
very
loudly
here.
and
justice
alito
asked
the
question,
what
would
cause
the
court
to
interpret
1981
and
1982
differently?
and
the
answer
is
absolutely
nothing.
these
are
two...
these
aren't
just
two
closely
related
statutes
that
were
codified
together.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
we're
asking
to
you
interpret
the
cause
of
action
that
exists--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--to
include
retaliation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
okay,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
part
of
the
disconnect
may
be,
if
i
could
try
to
address
this,
is
there
are
two
reasons
you
might
think
that
retaliation
isn't
covered.
one
reason
you
might
think
retaliation
isn't
covered
is
because
it's
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
other
reason
that
you
might
think
retaliation
is
not
covered
and
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals,
post
patterson,
pre-1991,
thought
that
retaliation
wasn't
covered
was
simply
that
it
was
post
formation
conduct.
and
as
to
that,
what
is
clear
is
that
1981(b)
provides
a
textual
answer
to
that.
a--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well...
but
neither
is
the
word
"harassment",
justice
kennedy.
neither,
frankly,
is
the
words
"discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
"
mr.
paul
d.
clement
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
since
mr.
humphries
was
fired
that
he
no
longer
enjoys
the
benefits
and
privileges
of
his
contractual
relationship.
they
were
clearly
interfered
with.
his
rights
under
1981
are
clearly
implicated.
it
would
seem
to
me
the
only
argument
that
he's
not
covered
is
that
he
was
retaliated...
he
was
fired,
he
lost
his
contractual
relationships
not
because
he
was
african-american--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
he
claimed--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--we
were
making
a
slightly
different
point,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
we
think
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
the
jackson
case
in
a
couple
of
respects.
first
and
foremost,
we
think
that
a
1982
precedent,
if
it
governs
title
ix,
ought
to
a
fortiorari
govern
1981.
but
the
second
way
we
think
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
jackson
is
that
the
same
textual
obstacles
are
not
present
here
that
the
jackson...
that
the
jackson
dissenters
identified.
you
know,
the
jackson
dissenters
didn't
say
that
retaliation
isn't
a
form
of
discrimination.
they
said
it's
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
and
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
1981(a),
(b),
and
(c),
you
find
that
it's
actually
more
capacious
language,
and
you
don't
have
the
same
problem.
it
doesn't
say
"discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
"
now,
to
be
sure,
we're
not
saying
that
1981
isn't
a
race
statute;
of
course
it
is.
but
those
exact
words
don't
appear
and
don't
provide
a
stumbling
block.
and
if
you
look
at
the
form
that
1981
takes,
it
doesn't
take
the
form
of
an
express
prohibition
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race;
it
actually
textually
takes
the
form
of
a
guarantee
of
equal
treatment.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
guarantee
of
equal
treatment
quite
naturally
is
violated
not
just
by
the
basic
discrimination
but
is
also
violated
by
retaliating--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--against
someone
for
exercising
their
rights.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
right.
judge
easterbrook's
hypothetical
of
the
equal
opportunity
retaliator
i
think
as
a
theoretical
matter
would
not
be
covered
by
this
statute.
but
of
course
i
think
it's
only
an
interesting
theoretical
possibility,
because
i
rather
doubt
that
employer
would
have
many
employees
in
practice.
i
mean,
in
practice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i...
i
actually
do
think
that's
unusual,
and
i
do
think
if
an
employer...
i
mean,
just
in
looking
at
the
cases
that
are
actually
decided,
you
don't
see
that
as
the
nondiscriminatory
defense
that
many
employers
resort
to.
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
that's
just
not
the
position
that
they're
taking.
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
you're
going
to
see
that
those
are
covered
by
the
statute.
you...
mr.
chief
justice,
you
also
asked
about
stare
decisis
and
which
cases
that
this
court
should
point
to.
i
think
there
are
a
couple
reasons
why
sullivan
is
the
precedent
that
this
court
should
follow
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
this
court
followed
it
in
a
less
analogous
context
just
a
few
terms
ago
in
jackson.
second,
this
court
has
a
whole
line
of
cases,
including
tillman
and
runyon,
that
treat
1982
cases
as
binding
authority
for
section
1981
purposes.
so
if
this
court
were
to
turn
its
back
on
sullivan,
i
think
it
would
also
be
turning
its
back
on
cases
like--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it...
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
say.
i
mean,
you
know,
jackson
was
just
three
terms
ago,
mr.
chief
justice,
so...
and
i
don't
know
how
jackson
would
have
been
decided
without
the
benefit
of
sullivan.
i
certainly
think
that
the
current
court
would
be
a
tougher
court
to
make
the
arguments
that
carried
the
day
in
sullivan
than
the
court
at
the
time,
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
point,
justice
souter.
and
i
guess
i
would
say
that,
just
to
amplify
something
my
co
counsel
said,
i
really
do
think...
i
mean,
the
jackson
court
took
the...
the
sullivan
case
to
be
something
other
than
a
third
party
standing
case
and
to
be
a
case
about
retaliation.
i
really
think
that
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
the
opinion.
if
you
look
at
the
critical
paragraph
on
page--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--of
both,
but
more
to
the
point,
of
sullivan.
if
you
go
to
page
237
of
the
sullivan
opinion,
after
the
court's
disposed
of
freeman's
claim
the
whole
discussion
of
sullivan's
claim
is
prefaced
with
the
observation
"we
turn
now
to
sullivan's
claim
for.
"
expulsion...
"for
advocacy
on
freeman's
behalf".
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
justice
kennedy,
if
that
were
the
only
claim
that
sullivan
could
bring,
i.e.,
if
he
could
only
bring
the
second
half
of
the
leasehold
claim
that
freeman
had,
i
would
agree
with
your
reading
of
sullivan.
but
what
the
court
is
focused
on
is
not
sullivan's
ability
to
sue
for
his
inability
to
sell
to
freeman.
they
allow
him
to
sue
because
he
was
expelled
from
the
property
owner's
association
after
the
fact.
now,
why
was
he
expelled
from
the
property
owner's
association?
not
because
of
his
race;
but
because
he
had
advocated
on
freeman's
behalf.
the
point
about
sullivan
getting
to
sue
for
his
expulsion
from--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
what's
critical
is
that
he
was
allowed
to
recover
not
just
for
that
injury
but
for
his
expulsion
from
the
property
owner's
association.
and
that's
not
an
injury
that
was
an
obvious
injury
to
freeman
at
all.
but
more
to
the
point,
it
doesn't
really
matter
if
freeman
and
sullivan
can
sue
for
that
or
just
sullivan.
the
point
is
somebody
could
sue
for
sullivan's
expulsion
from
the
property
owner's
association.
and
i
don't
understand
how
that's
anything
other
than
a
retaliation
holding.
and
as
i
said,
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
given
1982
holdings
even
stare
decisis
effect,
using
those
words
in
runyon
in
the
1981
context.
and
so
i
think
that's
also
something
that
this
court
would
have
to
confront.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
when--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
you
have
to
apply
its
reasoning.
that
would
be
consistent
with
decisions
like
runyon
and
tillman
that
say
that
you
apply
1982
cases
and
1981.
thank
you.
