mr.
hawkins,
is
it
at
all
relevant
on
the
issue
that
the
several
courts
of
appeals
have
come
out
the
same
way
both
before
the
1991
amendment
and
since
the
1991
amendment,
and
opinions
to
the
contrary
are
pretty
scarce?
does
that
have
any
weight
in
a
sort
of
a
stare
decisis
sense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
even
under
the
1991
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
fairly
uniform
on
the
answer
to
the
very
issue
we're
confronting
here.
isn't
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is,
are
they
entitled
to
give
any
stare
decisis
weight
to
a
consensus
among
all
the
courts
of
appeals
both
before
and
after
the
1991
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
have
to,
but
does
it
make
sense
in
trying
to
understand
the
stability
of
the
law
generally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
your
point
is
that
patterson
made
a
number
of
lower
courts
think
that
retaliation
was
no
longer
a
viable
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
patterson
they
had
all
thought
retaliation
was
a
cause
of
action.
