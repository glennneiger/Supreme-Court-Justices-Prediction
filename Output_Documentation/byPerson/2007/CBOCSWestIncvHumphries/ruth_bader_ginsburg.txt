justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
before
the
1991
amendment
retaliation
was
included?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
that
true
here?
because
we're
not
talking
about
retaliation
in
a
vacuum;
we're
talking
about
retaliation
for
complaining
about
race
discrimination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
kind
of...
what
kind
of
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination
would
there
be
if
once
one
complains
one
can
be
fired,
demoted?
that
would
not
be
a
very
effective
right,
would
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
one
can
say
the
same
thing
for
title
vii
and,
say,
the
equal
pay
act.
there
are
a
lot
of
overlapping
antidiscrimination
laws.
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
shrink
one
because
another
exists.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's...
that's
often
the
case,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
argument
you
just
made
could
go
as
well
to
somebody
who
uses
1981
to
complain
about
a
racially
based
demotion
wasn't
able
to
use
title
vii
because
he
filed
too
late.
that's
a
typical
use
of
1981;
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is
the
difference
between
this
case...
you
say,
well,
there's
title
vii
and
this
would
erode
title
vii.
doesn't
it
erode
title
vii
when
i'm
complaining
about,
say,
a
demotion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
course,
it's
just
for
race
claims,
and
title
vii
covers
sex,
national
origin.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
point
is
that
1981
would
not
be
available
to
other
categories.
it's
only
race,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
a
statute
that
has
the
same
derivation.
they're
both
from
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
and
they're
both
set
up
the
same
way.
1982
also
says
1981
does.
so
wouldn't
it
be
odd
to
take
these
twin
measures
and
say
one
includes
retaliation
and
the
other
doesn't?
wouldn't
congress,
when
it
revised
1981
in
1991
been
aware
of
sullivan
and
expect
this
court
to
interpret
those
twin
statutes
the
same
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
you
look
at
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
the
1991
amendments?
that
is,
congress
changed
the
law
that
this
court
had
declared;
and
the
message,
the
essential
message,
was
this
court
has
been
too
stingy
in
its
interpretation
of
title...
of
1981,
so
we're
going
to
change
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
wouldn't
be
hearing...
we
wouldn't
be
grasping
that
message.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
something
to
that
effect
in
the
legislative
history
that
explains
why
congress
made
the
amendments
it
did
in
1991.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
were...
when
there
damages,
as
opposed
to
back
pay,
added
as
a
remedy
for
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wasn't
that
it
was
cut
back,
as
the
chief
suggested.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
the
first
time
ever
title
vii
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
get
money
damages
as
distinguished
from
simply
back
pay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
interpretation
was
consistent
with
this...
was
it
2005,
long
after
those
other
new
approach
statutes,
decisions
were
on
the
books.
jackson
was
in
2005.
