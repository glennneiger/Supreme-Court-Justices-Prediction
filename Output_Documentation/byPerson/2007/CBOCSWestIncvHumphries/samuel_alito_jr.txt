alito,

do
you
see
any
meaningful
difference
between
the
language
of
1981
and
1982
in
this
regard?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
it
was
narrowed
in
1981?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
1991
act
to
broaden
the
scope
of
1981
rather
than
narrow
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
saying
they
would
have...
you're
saying
they
would
have
added
an
express
retaliation
provision
in
1981
in
1991
if
they
had
thought
that
the
mode
of
reasoning
in
sullivan
was
no
longer
sound?
is
that
what
this
comes
down
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
they
legislated
against
the
backdrop,
you're...
are
you
not
relying
on
something
they
didn't
do,
rather
than
anything
that
they
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
thought--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
we
thought
sullivan
was
incorrectly
decided,
what
should
we
do?
should
we
say
we
accept
it
insofar
as
it
interpreted
section
1982,
but
we
don't
necessarily
have
to
extend
it
to
1981,
to
take
an
approach
similar
to
what
we
did
in
the
recent
john
r.
sand
&
gravel
case?
or
do
we
have
to
apply
the
reasoning
in
the
1981
case
because
of
the
close
relationship
between
the
two
provisions?
