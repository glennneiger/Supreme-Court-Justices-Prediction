mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
based
on
the
plain
terms
of
section
1981,
this
court's
interpretation
of
that
statute
under
runyon,
patterson,
and
domino's
pizza,
as
well
as
congress'
recognition
of
the
distinction
between
discrimination
and
retaliation
and
this
court's
decision
in
burlington
northern,
section
1981
does
not
contain
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
retaliation.
the
court
starts
with
a
review
of
the
text
of
the
statute.
section
1981(a)
says
that
all
persons
shall
have
the
right,
the
same
right
as
is
enjoyed
by
white
citizens
to
make
and
enforce
contracts.
words
like
1981(a),
and
those
words
all
have
normal,
plain,
ordinary
meaning,
that
is
identical.
so
what
section
1981
says
is
in
the
making
and
enforcing
of
contracts
all
persons
shall
have
identical
rights
as
white
citizens.
as
we
move
into
this
issue--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--justice
alito,
i
do,
and
in
that
context
section
1981
was
amended
in
1991,
and
with
a
lot
of
this
court's
precedent
in
terms
of
how
statutes
are
viewed,
they
all
have
a
life.
this
section
1981
has
a
new
life
when
it
was
amended
in
1981.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
i
think
with
respect
to
this
issue,
your
honor,
of
retaliation,
that
it
was.
and
i
say
it
because
of
this.
in
1991,
congress
passed
the
1991
civil
rights
act
and
in
that
act
they
also
included
retaliation
for
2
u.s.c.
1212.
so
congress
was
consciously
thinking
about
this
issue
of
retaliation.
they
had
patterson
that
had
come
before
it,
they
had
west
virginia
hospital
that
had
come
before
it,
saying
you
have
to
have
specific
terms,
you
have
to
deal
with
specific
issues.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
'91
act,
it
was
supposed
to
specifically
pick
up
the
post
formation
contract
issues
under
patterson.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
it
didn't--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--it
didn't
change
patterson.
i
believe
as
chief
judge
easterbrook
said,
patterson
has
been
cited
some
27
times
by
this
court--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--or
"e
s-ter-brook".
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
your
honor.
by
this
court,
and
in
that
context
it
is
still
good
law.
what
it
did
was
to
clarify
the
issue
of
post
formation
contracts.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes.
i
think
patterson
would
come
out
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no.
in
the
context
of
the
new
post
formation...
excuse
me.
i
understood
your
question
a
little
differently,
your
honor.
yes,
it
would
come
out
differently
if
you
were
dealing
with
the
precise
issue
in
patterson.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no.
i
would
say,
justice
ginsburg,
that
before
the
1991
amendment
retaliation
wasn't
included
and
it
wasn't
included
after
the
1991
amendment.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
it
wasn't
included--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--in
respect
to
the
post
formation.
patterson
was
dealing
with
those
aspects
of
just
the
initial
making
and
enforcing
of
a
contract,
not
once
you've
got
the
contract
established
and
in
this
case
employment,
what
happens,
promotions,
demotions,
actions
of
that
nature,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well
your
honor--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--what
other
post
formation--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--patterson
was
dealing
with
the
issue
about
after
you
had
the
relationship
could
an
employer
take
an
adverse
discriminatory
action
against
the
individual,
and
the
court
said
no.
it
was
dealing
with
a
harassment
situation.
afterwards
you
could
not
have
a
cause
of
action
in
the
post
formation
situation.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
but
congress
changed
it
to
say
that
it
would
include,
in
subsection
1981(b),
that
it
would
include
certain
specified
post
formation
conduct
with
respect
to--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--it
did
not
change
that,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
did
not
add
retaliation.
and
so
what
has
taken
place
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
discrimination
and
retaliation
and
the
reason
that
we
say
that
it
does
not
exist
in
section
1981
is
congress
in
some
30
statutes
we've
been
able
to
run
across
has
specifically
included
retaliation
in
provisions
where
they
so
applauded
appropriate--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--if
it
is
racial
harassment,
meaning
the
treating
of
someone
differently
than
a
white
citizen
because
of
their
race,
then
it
would
be.
that's
the
status
issue
and
that's
what
was
addressed
in
burlington
northern
in
terms
of
the
distinction
that
exists
between
discrimination
and
retaliation,
one
being
based
on
the
individual
status,
which
is
really
what
section
1981
is
focused
on.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
if
it's
just
harassment,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
abstract...
i'm
harassing
somebody
because
i
don't
like
them...
whether
they're
black
or
white,
that
wouldn't
be
actionable
under
section
1981.
you
have
to
have
a
focus
of
"i'm
taking
this
action
against
the
individual
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin,
because
of
their
race.
"
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
if
you
have
a
situation
where...
and
i
think
it's
even
addressed
in
some
of
the
respondent's
brief.
and
many
of
the
cases
going
back
in
the
'70s
and
'80s
that
were
even
cited
by
the
seventh
circuit,
all
deal
with
situations
even
where
they
were,
if
you
want
to
call
them
retaliation,
they
were
retaliation
based
on
directly
the
person's
color
of
their
skin.
they
were
this
particular
supervisor
or
this
employer
is
taking
this
or
that
action
against
somebody
because
they're
a
black
person.
they're
not
taking--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
i
mean
there
are
alternatives
for
that
particular
issue.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
title
vii
that
fully
protected
the
respondent
from
any
form
of
discrimination
or
retaliation.
in
addition,
in
the
state
of
illinois
there
are
state
statutes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
but
there
is
precedent
for
the
fact
that
where
one
law
does
cover
a
particular
situation,
we
don't
go
about
removing
that
impact.
so
title
vii
clearly
does
cover
this
particular
situation
of
a
retaliation,
a
pure
retaliation
claim.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
they
did
proceed
under
title
vii,
and
that
was
dismissed
by
the
federal
court
because
he
did
not
pay
his
proper
filing
fee
on
time
in
compliance
with
title
vii
requirements.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
it
can
be
a
use,
yes,
your
honor,
that
people
do
use
it
for
that
very
purpose.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
because
they
can
coexist
with
respect
to
those
particular
issues,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
those
two
statutes
can
coexist.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
based
on
a
reading
of
domino's,
it
would
certainly
appear
that
the
individual
who
is
making
the
complaint
to
have
protection
must
be
the
individual
who
has
the
contractual
right,
as
opposed
to
complaining
about
a
third
person.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
in
order
to
have
a
retaliation
claim
under
section
1981,
it
really
has
to
be
a
discrimination
claim.
you
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
you--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
they
can
make...
phrase
it
however
they
want
to
in
terms
of
their
particular
complaint,
but
the
issue
in
terms
of
the
analysis
under
the
plain
text
of
section
1981
is
whether
or
not
a
white
person
in
this
situation
is
being
treated
differently
with
respect
to
making
a
similar
complaint.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--there
is
no
retaliation
claim
in
the
abstract
under
this
statute,
period,
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
your
honor.
in
my
32
years
of
experience
of
doing
labor
and
employment
law,
and
particularly
in
employment
law,
individuals
are
not
typically
bringing
1981
retaliation
claims,
where
most--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--did
we
see
a
big
spurt
in
those?
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
from
our
experience,
more
and
more
people...
there's
been
a
trend
to
go
to
state
court
because
more
and
more
states--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--in
federal--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--in
the
federal
system.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question,
yes,
we've
seen
more
adding
on
section
1981
claims
with
title
vii
claims
in
federal
court.
so
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
title
vii
covers
race
and
retaliation.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
longer
statute
of
limitations,
similar
attorney's
fees,
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
you
do,
but
it's
a
longer
statute
of
limitations,
and
it's
uncapped
damages
because
of
the
caps
under
title
vii
that
exists.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
it's
going
to
depend
upon
the
state
and--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
justice
breyer,
if
white
individuals
are
also
terminated
for
making
complaints--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
go
back
to
the
plain,
clear
terms
with
their
ordinary
meaning,
and
it
says
equal
rights
as
white
citizens
and
it
talks
about
the
same
and
that--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--if
they
have--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--if
they
are
not
being
treated--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--does
it
have
the
words
"you
may
go
into
court
for
lawsuit?
"
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no,
we're
here
dealing
dealing
with
federal
statutes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
state
courts
develop
public
policy.
they
do.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
rights
of
action
have
existed
under
federal
statute,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
this
court
has
established
that,
particularly
with
respect
to
section
1981,
that
an
individual
does
have
a
right
of
action.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
because
this
court
in
a
variety
of
cases
such
as
russello,
west
virginia,
university
hospital,
arlington
public
school,
has
said
that
we
look
at
the
text
and
we
examine
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
unless
it
is
ambiguous...
and
i
would
certainly
submit
that
words
like
"same",
"like",
"equal"
are
not
ambiguous
terms...
that
we
leave
it
alone;
that
that's--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--it's
not
in
there,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
because--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
in
response
to
it,
i
would
simply
say
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
text
as
to
how
you're
trying
to
apply
it,
and
what
you're
applying
it
to,
and
this
particular
statute
protects
against
different
treatment,
not
specifically
with
respect
to
some
other--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--yes.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
i...
we...
we
do
invoke
those
in
our
brief,
and
those
are
all
part
of
what
i'm
getting
at
in
terms
of...
i
mean
arlington
school
board
was
one
of
those
cases.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
particularly
since
this
court
has
runyon,
patterson,
and
domino's
interpreting
section
1981,
that's
what
to
look
at
to
interpret
section
1981,
not
sullivan,
which
interprets
a
different
statute.
they
all--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--justice
ginsburg,
with
all
due
respect,
i
would
think
not;
and
the
reason
is
this
court,
when
it
acted
in
1991,
had
in
front
of
it
to
look
at
patterson,
which
was
saying,
we're
going
to
interpret
section
1981
in
a
straightforward,
plain
text
situation.
in
fact,
patterson
says
in
it
if
the
right
is
not
specifically
set
forth
in
section
1981,
there
is
no
relief.
then
after
that,
you
had
west
virginia,
which
was
decided
in
march
of
1991,
again
taking
that
same
sort
of
approach
with
respect
to
if
it's
not
in
the
statute,
we're
not
going
to
make
it.
it
may
be
that
it's
a
job
left
for
congress.
so
they
act
on
those
and
pass
the
law
in
november
of
'91.
that's
the
context.
and
even
in
the
jackson
case,
in
looking
back,
justice
o'connor
ended
up
saying
that
what
we
are
looking
back
at
is
1972
following
1969.
so
in
1991
we're
looking
at
section
1981
being
amended,
and
we're
looking
at
patterson
and
west
virginia
to
give
the
context.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
but,
your
honor,
in--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--well,
i
think
that
there
was
some
perspective.
i
don't
personally
agree
with
it,
but
i
think
there
was
some--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--i
agree,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
right.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no.
there's
nothing
in
that
at
all.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
and
we
could
have
a
whole
debate
about
the
legislative
history
and
what--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--yes,
that's
evidence
that
somebody
in
congress
was
thinking
that.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
but
i
think
if
we
just
use
an
analogy
with
contract
law,
if
we're
negotiating
a
contract--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--no,
they
did
not.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
well,
somebody
wrote
it
in
a
report.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
it
doesn't
have
any
significance
with
respect
to
this
legislation.
what
i'm
saying
is
i
think
it
works
against...
that
argument
works
against
what
ended
up
being
in
the
statute.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
is
saying
we're
not
making
the
at
will
argument
in
this
case,
and
that's
not
where
we
are
going.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
it
could
be
made
and
it
could
be
developed.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
whether
it...
it
may
well
be
a
benefit
or
a
privilege,
your
honor,
but
it
isn't
shown
that
there's
different
treatment
than
a
white
employee.
i
mean
just
to
say,
i
exercised
this
benefit
and
something
happened
to
me
negatively,
therefore,
i
have
a
claim
under
section
1981,
that's
not
where
it's
going.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
no.
stare
decisis
applies
when
it's
the
same
facts
and
the
same
set
of
law
and
this
is
not
the
same
facts
and
the
same
set
of
law.
this
is
section
1991,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
they
have,
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
they
haven't
been
following
the
text
of
the
statute.
they
have
just
been
relying
on
sullivan.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
i
don't
believe
the
supreme
court
has
to
give
stare
decisis--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--based
on
our
argument
it
does
not,
your
honor.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
respondent
and
the
government
and
its
amicus
arguments
are
more
appropriate
on
the
floor
of
congress
debating
whether
or
not
to
amend
section
1981
to
include
retaliation.
instead
of
giving
the
clear
and
plain
meaning
of
the
terms
and
the
ordinary
and
natural
definitions,
the
seventh
circuit
relied
on
extrinsic
issues
to
reach
its
decision
in
violation
of
article
1
section
1
of
the
constitution.
it
exercised
its
will
instead
of
its
judgment
in
violation
of
the
principles
set
forth
in
jones
versus
bock,
where
this
court
had
said
the
judge's
job
is
to
construe
the
statute,
not
to
make
it
better.
george
washington
said
in
1790
"i've
always
been
persuaded
that
the
success
of
our
nation
and
our
government
depends
upon
the
acceptance
its
people
and
that
that
would
depend
upon
the
interpretation
and
execution
of
its
laws.
"
"therefore,
it
is
important
that
the
judicial
system
should
not
only
be
independent
in
its
operation
but
as
perfect
as
possible
in
its
formation.
"
to
follow
the
text
of
the
statute,
this
court's
interpretations
of
section
1981
and
the--
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
--i
understand,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
w.
hawkins
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
