justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
to
say
it
was
designed
to
overrule
patterson.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
overrule.
they
can't
overrule
it,
but
change
the
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
that
patterson
would
no
longer
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
they
would
be
astounded.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
change
did
the
1991
amendment
make
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
was
intended
to
change
the
outcome
of
patterson.
in
what
respect?
you
say
not
in
the
respect
of
whether
retaliation
is
included
but
in
what
respect
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
you.
patterson
said
that
post
formation
actions
were
not
covered,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
retaliation
is
one,
but
just
one
of
many
post
formation
actions,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
post
formation
actions
were
there
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
was
the
post
formation
action
that
was
in
action
in
patterson?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
specify
them.
i
think
your
point
is
probably
that
it
includes
the
same
post
formation
conduct
that
is
prohibited
at
formation,
which
is
to
say
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
which
is
not
retaliation;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they...
why
did
they
proceed
under
title
vii
then?
what...
what
help--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does...
does
the
person
who
is
retaliated
against,
that
is
the
person
who
complained
and
is
retaliated
against,
have
to
be
the
person
who
was
discriminated
against?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely...
surely,
you
don't
mean
what
you
just
said
a
minute
ago,
that
in
order
to
have
a
retaliation
claim
you
must
have
a
discrimination
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
it's
your
position
that
even
when
you
have
a
discrimination
claim,
you
don't
have
a
retaliation
claim.
i
thought
it
was
your
position
there
are
no
retaliation
claims
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
advantages
to
1981?
you
get
attorney's
fees
in
1981?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
get
that
under
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
federal
common
law?
are
we
sitting
here
trying
to
write
a
federal
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
state
courts
can
do
that.
they
can
make
it
up;
can't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hawkins,
don't
we
have
a
whole
line
of
recent
cases
which
say
we
have
set
our
face
against
implying
causes
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
whole
bunch
of
recent
cases
saying
we're
not
going
to
do
that
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
used
to
do
it,
but
we
said
we're
not
going
to
do
it
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
don't
you
invoke
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
agree
with
that?
i
don't
understand
why
you
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
don't
say
"yes".
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
that
congress
thought
our
interpretation
of
1981
was
perfectly
reasonable,
or
it
had
no
idea
what
our
interpretation
of
1981
was.
but
they
know
what
they
wanted
to
do
in...
in
1991.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
we
know
for
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
congress
wanted
that
disposition.
they
weren't
necessarily
disapproving
our
prior
decision.
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
which
said
the
supreme
court
made
a
bad
decision,
and
we're
going
to
fix
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
committee
vote
on
that
committee
report?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
do
you
know
if
anybody
in
congress
thought
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
have
been
a
teenager
who
wrote
the
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
argument
to
congress.
congress
should
enact
a
retaliatory
provision.
but
the
statute
says
what
it
says,
and
what
it
says
is
that
there
has
to
be
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
firing
somebody
for...
in
retaliation
for
making
a
complaint
is
not
firing
him
on
the
basis
of
race.
indeed,
the
person
making
the
complaint
may
not
have
been
the
person
who
was
racially
discriminated
against.
you
would
acknowledge
that
you
couldn't
fire...
if
retaliations
claims
lie,
you
couldn't
fire
a
white
whistleblower
who
says
this
employer
has
been
discriminating
against
blacks.
wouldn't
that
white
whistleblower
have
a
cause
of
action
for
being
fired?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
your
theory,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
text
of
the
statute,
which
requires
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
agree
with
you
entirely
that
it
would
make
sense
to
provide
a
cause
of
action
for
retaliation,
but
we
don't
write
statutes.
we
read
them.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
statute
that
says
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
make
any
sense
then,
either.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
those
court
of
appeals
cases
pre-1991
that
found
there
was
a
retaliation
claim,
right,
those
cases
were
just
wrong
as
to
whether
there
was
any
post
contract
claim?
right?
i
mean,
they
were
wrong
about
that.
patterson,
in
effect,
said
you're
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
they
were
wrong
about
whether
there's
a
post
contract
claim,
why
wouldn't
they
be
wrong
about
whether
there's
a
retaliation
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
we
should
give
deference
to
them
on
the
one
point
when
they've
been
proven
wrong
on
the
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
little
more
complicated
than
that.
we
inferred
that
cause
of
action
in
the
bad
old
days,
when
we
were
inferring
causes
of
action
all
over
the
place.
now,
the
position
the
government
takes
here
is
that
we
should
infer
this
new
cause
of
action
to
assist
the
one
that's
already
on
the
books.
is
the
government
going
to
be
consistent
in
this
position?
and
you
want
us
to
in
the
future
go
back
to
our
prior
practice
of
readily
inferring
causes
of
action
that
are
not
set
forth
in
the...
in
the
text
of
this
statute?
is
the
government
willing
to
live
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
patterson
was
still
the
bad
old
days.
when
do
you
think
the
bad
old
days
ended?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
thinking
of
sullivan.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
no
longer
washington,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
didn't
know
where
he
stopped
and
you
began.
[laughter]
