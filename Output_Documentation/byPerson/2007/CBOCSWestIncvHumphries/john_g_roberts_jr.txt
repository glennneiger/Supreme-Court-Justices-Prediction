chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-1431,
cbocs
west
v.
humphries.
mr.
hawkins.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
is
your
position
that
in
that
situation
a
retaliation
is
not
covered
by
1981?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
you
could
argue
that
it's
direct
discrimination.
in
other
words,
if
you're
fired,
whatever
form
the
retaliation
takes,
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
that
that
would
be
on
the
basis...
basis
of
race.
and
i
thought
your
position,
or
at
least
your
position
could
be
narrowed
to
say
it's
only
when
the
individual
against
whom
the
retaliation
takes
place
is
not
the
individual
complaining
of
the
direct
discrimination
that
your
position
would
be
pertinent.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
that's
why
i
thought
the
person
directly
discriminated
against
would
be
able
to
phrase
the
retaliation
claim
certainly
as
a
discrimination
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
do
have
those
recent
cases,
but
we
also
have
the
sullivan
case
interpreting...
interpreting
1982,
which
arose
under
the
prior
approach
to
these
questions.
and
my
question
for
you
is:
under
principles
of
stare
decisis,
which
body
do
we
follow,
the
earlier
case
interpreting
1982
under
the
more
freewheeling
approach
to
statutory
interpretation
or
this
later
body
of
law
that
says
we're
not
going
to
do
that
any
more?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
hyndman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
why
would
anyone
ever
bring
a
title
vii
action
if
they
could
bring
a
1981
action?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
so
if
you
bring...
you'd
at
least
bring
them
both,
right,
because--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--1981
allows
you
to
get
out
of
the
title
vii
cap
on
damages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
isn't
that
rendering
congress'
careful...
i
mean
the
1991
legislation
was
a
careful
compromise.
in
exchange
for
the
expansions
of
title
vii,
they
put
caps
on
the
damages.
you
would
allow
them
to
keep
the
expansion,
but
do
away
with
the
caps.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
just
begging
the
question.
you're
assuming
you
have
the
right
that's
at
issue
here
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
then,
why
do
they
put
the
caps
in?
i
mean,
i
do
think
that
is
a
limitation
on
the
remedy
they
provided.
they
provided
a
damage
remedy
with
a
very
clear
cap
and
it's
not
a
particularly
generous
cap,
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
would
allow
them
to
completely
obliterate
that
cap
under
any
case
that
could
be
brought
under
1981.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
you
agreed
with
justice
breyer
that
we're
looking
for
a
word
that
couldn't
be
there,
you
said
yes,
but
it
is
in
fact
a
word
that
is
there
in
about
37
other
statutes,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
word
could
be
there.
i'm
not
saying
whether
it
has
to
be
there
or
not.
but
it
certainly
could
be
there,
and
it's
not
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
provide
a
specific
cause
of
action
for
retaliation,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this...
the
question
i
asked
your
friend
and
i'll
ask
you
as
well.
i
think
you
have
a
case
under
sullivan,
which
recognized,
although
it's
1982,
this
type
of
action.
but
sullivan
would
not
come
out
the
same
way
today
given
alexander
against
sandoval
and
our
new
approach
to
statutory
interpretation.
so
if
you're
concerned
about
stare
decisis,
which
body
of
law
do
you
give
effect
to,
the
sullivan
case
or
our
more
recent
cases
on
how
to
read
statutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
course,
by
1991
our
new
approach
to
reading
statutes
was
pretty
clearly
established.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
congress
were
looking
at
both
of
those
bodies
of
law,
then
wouldn't
the
normal
care
be
for
it
to
put
in
a
retaliation
provision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
the
extent
your
argument
relies
so
heavily
on
sullivan,
i
went
back
and
read
it,
and
rather
than
an
implied
right
of
action
case
it
looked
to
me
like
a
third
party
standing
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
think...
that's
right.
now
i
get
back
to
another
stare
decisis
question.
do
i
rely
on
what
sullivan
actually
said,
or
i
do
i
rely
on
jackson's
reinterpretation
of
sullivan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree,
though,
that
the
language
in
the
opinion
focuses
on
it
as
a
third
party
standing
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
if
you
have--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
have
an
employer
who
fires
everybody
who
complains
about
practices
at
work,
that
would
not
be
covered
retaliation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
unusual
for
employers
to
have
a
practice
that
anybody
who
alleges
that
i've
committed
a
violation
of
federal
law,
i
want
to
get
rid
of
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that
sullivan
would
come
out
differently
today
under
our
current
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
correct
reading
of
jackson
or
of
sullivan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
hawkins,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
