justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
an
exception
if,
in
fact,
the
school
district
admits
that
they
can't
do
anything
for
this
child?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
have
(b).
what
about
(b)?
see
look,
there
are
two
situations.
situation
(a)
is
that
the
school
district
thinks
they
can
give
them
a
good
education,
adequate.
then
he
should
go
and
try
it
out,
and
if
by
the
way
the
school
district
just
can't
do
it,
then
(b).
so
what's
been
wrong
with
that
scheme?
why
doesn't
that
cover
the
waterfront?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
the
language...
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
language
plus
the
fact
that
nobody
can
think
of
a
reason
for
putting
that
in
there,
unless
that's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
my
question
was
what
about
(b)?
my
question
was
not
to
argue
with
you.
my
question
was,
why
doesn't
(b)
take
care
of
the
examples
of
absurd
situations,
law
situations
that
you've
mentioned?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
case
where
the
school
district
just
can't
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
just
can't
do
it
then
their
job
is
to
put
the
kid
in
a
district--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
a
place
that
can
do
it.
and
if
their
argument,
which
is
your
case,
is
it
they
object
to
the
facility,
then
have
an
argument
about
that,
about
whether
it
should
be
this
private
school
or
that
private
school.
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
your
case
is
about,
and
that's
why
i
think
b.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(b),
that's
my
question,
(b).
i
thought
you
were
right.
until
i
heard
that.
then
i
suddenly
hear
no,
that
don't
worry
about
it,
judge,
is
what
i
heard,
because
in
the
situation
where
the
school
district
has
not
provided
there
is
another
section
of
the
statute
that
takes
care
of
the
child.
that's
what
i
want
to
hear
your
response
to.
