justice

so
that
enabled
the
parent
to
remove
the
child
immediately
and
risk
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
public
education
would
be
found
inadequate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
that
section
does
is
to
repeat
the
burlington
scenario.
it
says,
it
codifies
what
the
court
held.
the
court
didn't
say
anything
in
burlington
about
the
situation
where
the
child
was
never
in
public
education.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
not
children...
i
think
there
was
a
brief
on
behalf
of
the
autism
society
that
says
many
school
systems
simply
do
not
have
the
facilities
to
attend
to
the
needs
of
these
children?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
not
cases
where
school
districts
have
said
from
day
one,
look,
we
don't
have
facilities
to
handle
this
type
of
disability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
parent
will
never
be
reimbursed?
let's
take
the
parent
that
justice
scalia
has
hypothesized,
will
never
get
one
penny
of
that
tuition
unless
that
parent
carries
the
burden...
the
parent
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
appropriate
public
education?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
the
question
i
asked.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
said
that
the
parent...
let's
assume
that
the
parent
never
sends
the
child
to
public
school,
nonetheless
seeks
reimbursement.
in
order
to
get
reimbursement
that
parent
would
have
to
show,
would
have
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
no
appropriate
public
education
available;
is
that
not
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
conclusion
would
be
that
that
parent
hasn't
met
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
no
appropriate
public
education.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
basis
for
saying
that,
when
the
one
thing
that
the
statute
is
very
clear
on
is
that
the
starting
premise
of
any
reimbursement
claim
is
that
an
appropriate
public
education
is
not
available?
that
wouldn't
concentrate,
testing
that
wouldn't
concentrate
on
what
the
private
school
is
doing
but
what
the
public
school
could
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
have
the
burden;
the
parents
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
this
statute
was
also
premised
on
section
5
of
the
14th
amendment,
in
which
case
it
wouldn't
have
spending
clause
notice
argument.
