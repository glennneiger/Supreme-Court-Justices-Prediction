mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
a
school
district
may
both
refuse
to
provide
a
child
with
a
disability
with
an
appropriate
public
placement
and
refuse
to
pay
for
an
appropriate
private
placement.
this
court
has
twice
before
considered
and
twice
before
unanimously
rejected--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
he
does
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
that
the...
the
school
district
can
take
the
position,
even
if
the
iet
that
is
proposed
is
inadequate
and
it's
adjudicated
to
be
inadequate,
because
the
schaffer
presumption
that
was
brought
up
earlier
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
because
we
are
talking
about
situations
where
a
parent
can
prove
that
the
placement
was
inadequate.
in
that
situation
the
parent
cannot
qualify
for
reimbursement
unless
it
subjects
his
child
to
the
inappropriate
placement.
this
court
rejected
that
rationale
in
clear
and
unambiguous
terms
in
the
burlington
case.
justice
rehnquist
put
it
in
that
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--under
a
different
statute
but
interpreting
the
fundamental
requirement
of
the
statute
that
all
children
with
disabilities
are
entitled
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
but
that
requirement
didn't
change,
and
this
is
what
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the...
the
part
of
the
burlington
case
i'm
referring
to
justice
scalia
is
the
interpretation
of
the
fundamental
requirement
of
providing
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
and
what
justice
rehnquist
said
there...
and
the
unanimous
court
agreed...
is
forcing
a
parent
to
choose
between
subjecting
his
child
to
inadequate
public
placement
or
paying
for
private
placement
deprives
the
parent
of
his
right
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
way
the
10-business-days
requirement
works
in
practice
is
that
all
of
the
ieps...
virtually
all
of
them
are
proposed
towards
the
end
of
the
school
year;
and,
typically,
the
parent
is
submitted
the
proposed
iep
during
the
summer.
and
it's
at
that
point
that
they
have
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
litigate
that,
put
their
child
in
a
private
school,
or
put
them
into
a
public
school.
so
the
10
business
days
in
practice
is
not
going
to
require
the
child
to
go
into
the
inadequate
placement.
that
was
true
in
the
fact
pattern--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
we
don't...
we
don't
dispute
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
order...
in
order
to
qualify
for
reimbursment
in
that
provision
which
is...
which
is
followed
by
the
provision
describing
in
more
concrete
detail
the
circumstances
that
courts
ought
to
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
reimbursement
is
appropriate.
and
if
i
can
explain
the
way
we
read
section
1412(a)(10)(c),
the
first
part
of
that
subsection
is
subsection
(c)(i).
that
hasn't
come
up
during
the
argument
today.
it
is
barely
mentioned
in
petitioner's
brief.
that
subsection...
it
is
on
page
5a
in
the
appendix
to
the
gray
brief,
lays
down
the
general
rule...
the
rule
that
tells
school
districts
when
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
paying
reimbursement.
and
that
is
when
they
provide
a
free,
a
public...
an
appropriate
public
education
in
the
first
place.
that...
that
is
consistent
with
burlington
and
carter,
and
that
lays
down
the
general
rule.
school
districts
that
provide
an
appropriate
placement
don't
have
to
worry
about
reimbursement.
subsection
(c)(ii)
then
goes
on
to
identify
a
particular
fact
pattern
which
also
happens
to
be
the
most
common
situation
in
which
reimbursement
claims
are
presented
to
the
courts.
and
congress
in
that
situation,
along
with
subsections
(3)
and
(4),
provided
the
courts
with
more
concrete
guidance
in
determining
how
to
exercise
their
discretion
in
that
situation.
the
legislative
history
supports
that
interpretation.
on
pages
25
to
29
of
the
national
disability
rights
network
brief
they
explain
how
congress
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
they
were
focused
on
case
law
applying
this
court's
decision
in
burlington
and
carter
where
the
students
were
already
enrolled
in
public
school.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
at
all
in
the
legislative
record
that
anybody
had
in
mind
scaling
back
the
fundamental
mandate
of
the
statute
for
school
districts
to
provide
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education
for
every
child.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
it
would,
your
honor,
insofar
as
we
are
dealing
with
flushing
out
the
requirements
for
students
enrolled
in
public
school.
but
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
meant
to
scale
back
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
act's
fundamental
mandate
to
provide
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
petitioner's
give-it-a-try
rationale
just
doesn't
fit
to
advance
its
argument
before
this
court.
it
doesn't
fit
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
is
suggesting
that
you
have
to
give
public
school
a
try,
because
it's
clear
that
the...
their
interpretation
would
apply
to
students
in
public
school,
as
well
as
private
school.
it
would
apply
to
all
students
entering
the
special
education
system,
including
the
student
who's
been
enrolled
in
public
school
from
kindergarten
to
11th
grade.
if
he
hasn't
previously
received
special-education
or
related
services,
then,
under
petitioner's
view,
if
he's
offered
a
grossly
inadequate
plan,
he
has
to
be
subjected
to
that
plan
in
order
for
his
parents
to
qualify.
and
petitioner's
interpretation
doesn't
require
the
parents
to
give
the
proposed
placement
at
issue
a
try.
all
it
requires
is
that
they
show
that
they
received
previous
special-education
services
at
some
point
in
the
past.
and
that's
the
way
it
worked
in
burlington;
that's
the
way
it
worked
in
carter;
and
that's
the
way
it
works
in
most
of
the
cases.
students
are
already
in
the
special
education
system,
and
they
are
proposed
an
iet
at
some
point
typically
during
the
summer.
and
the
parents
at
that
time
say
this
iet
is
inadequate
for
my
child,
and
i
want
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
you
have
previously
received
special-education
services.
but
my
point,
justice
scalia,
is
under
petitioner's...
the
way
they
read
the
statute,
you
don't
have
to
give
the
proposed
placement
at
issue
a
try.
so
to
the
extent
that
this
court
thinks,
or
petitioner
is
arguing,
that
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
could
better
evaluate
whether
or
not
this
proposed
placement
proposed
placement
is
going
to
work
for
this
child.
that
doesn't
fit
with
the
statutory
language
because
in
practice
the
students...
all
they
have
to
show
is
that
they
received
services
at
some
point
in
the
past
and
if
they
have
they
can
go
into
private
school
and
seek
reimbursement.
it
doesn't
require
a
student
to
be
subjected
to
the
inadequate
plan
unless
you
happen
to
be
the
student
who
is
enrolled
in
public
school
or
enrolled
in
private
school
and
you're
entering
the
special
education
system.
at
that
point
then,
petitioner's
interpretation
requires
the
parents
to
enroll
their
child
who
has
already
been
determined
to
have
a
learning
disability
in
a
plan
that
is
inadequate,
and
we
think
that
is
an
untenable
result.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
two
points
about
that...
first,
parents
who
do
enroll
their
children
in
private
school
at
their
own
financial
risk.
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
winkelman,
there
are
particular
incentives
against
bringing
frivolous
reimbursement
claims
in
this
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
justice
scalia...
two
points
on
that,
first
the
statute
provides
in
clear
and
unambiguous
terms
that
all
children
with
disabilities
are
entitled
to
a
free
and
appropriate
education.
the
child
find
requirement,
which
section
1412--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
why
the
way
that
school
districts
can
avoid
reimbursement
is
to
offer
an
adequate
placement
in
the
first
place.
that's
what
section
1412(a)(10)(c)(i)
provides.
it
lays
down
the
general
rule.
school
district
today
talks
about
we
need
to
have
collaboration,
we
need
to
have
cooperation
during
the
iep
process.
they
hold
all
the
cards
during
that
process.
and
if
they
want
to
avoid
reimbursement
they
should
do
what
this
court
said
in
the
carter
case,
that's
provide
the
student
with
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
mandate
to
provide
a
free
and
appropriate
education
for
all
children
with
disabilities.
i
would
say
though,
and
i
want
to
be
clear
on
this...
even
though
appearance
of
students
in
private
school
or
in
public
school
who
haven't
previously
received
special
education
or
related
services
qualify
for
reimbursement
under
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
entitled
to
reimbursement.
in
the
situations
your
honor
may
have
in
mind,
where
the
parents
genuinely
aren't
complying
in
good
faith
or
genuinely
aren't
interested
in
sending
their
kids
to
public
school,
they
only
want
to
try
to
gain
the
system...
in
those
hypothetical
situations,
courts
have
equitable
discretion
to
deny
reimbursement
claims,
and
they
have
denied
those
reimbursement
claims.
