mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court.
in
1985
when
this
court
decided
the
burlington
decision,
it
based...
it
based
it
based
on
the
broad
remedial
clause
set
forth
in
20
u.s.c.
1415,
which
allowed
an
impartial
hearing
officer,
a
state
review
officer,
or
the
court,
itself,
to
grant
relief
where
appropriate.
in
so
doing,
it
noted
that
there
was
no
other
substantive
section
which
touched
and
concerned
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
that
is
whether
an
individual
can
voluntarily
remove
a
child
and
seek
tuition
reimbursement
before
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
and
court
remedies.
it
made
a
point
of
noting
that
it
felt
it
was
gleaning
the
congressional
intent;
and,
had
congress
known
that
the
administrative
and
court
process
would
be
protracted,
it
would
have
provided
a
process
which
would
allow
the
child
to
be
removed.
similarly,
in
the
sequel,
the
carter
case,
the
court
made
the
other...
the
same
conclusion.
it
noted
that,
although
the
primary
responsibilities
to
educate
the
child
in
a
public
school,
least
restrictive
environment,
there
would
be
occasions
when
you
would
place
that
child
outside,
having
been
in
the
school
system.
1412,
which
was
the
eligibility
section
during
this
period,
was
very
truncated.
it
did
not
provide
a
lot
of
conversation
concerning
the
relationship
of
public
and
private
schools
within
the
idea.
it
provided
that
you
had
to
provide
the
child
who
demanded
it
a
fape,
a
free
appropriate
education.
if
you
couldn't
do
that,
the
public
school
had
to
then
pay
for
the
tuition.
it
was
silent
though
on
the
relationship
between
the
private
schools
where
the
child
voluntary
removes.
in
1997
the
idea
was
codified,
and
for
the
first
time
the
specific
section
was
inserted
dealing
with
the
relationship
of
children
and
private
schools.
indeed,
20
u.s.c.
1412(a)(10)...
just
the
beginning,
just
that
paragraph,
says
"children
placed
in
private
schools"
and
the
structure
was
detailed.
subdivision
(a)
dealt
with
the
relationshiop
of
the
private
schools
with
the
public
system
generally
and
noted
that,
in
that
particular
case,
while
the
children
would
be
entitled
to
some
small
amount
of
federal
funding,
they
would
not
be
entitled
in
private
school
to
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
we
also
noted
that
if
a
parent
was
dissatisfied
with
the
service
plan,
they'd
have
to
seek
relief
administratively.
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
an
impartial
due
process
or
a
court
review.
it
was
a
recognition
that
children
who
are
placed
in
private
school
were
entitled
to
much
lesser
services
than
children
placed
in
public
school.
subdivision
(b)
dealt
with
the
situation
when
children
were
not
placed
in
public
school
but
the
local
district
consented
that
they
could
not
provide
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
as
a
consequence,
in
those
cases
and
in
only
those
cases,
since
the
public
would
then
be
supervising
and
directing
the
private
school,
they
would
be
responsible
for
the
tuition.
sub
(c)
is
the
issue
now
before
this
court.
sub
(c)
is
entitled
children
placed
in
private
school,
payment
and
where
the
local
education
aagency
did
not
consent.
and
that
particular
section
is
broken
down
again
into
three
parts.
the
first
part
says,
if
a
child
is
offered
fape,
that
is,
a
child
is
given
a
program
which
is
adequate,
you
cannot
get
reimbursement
if
you
remove
your
child
during
any
time
but
in
this
case
during
the
pendency
of
the
administrative
and
the
court
process.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
answer
is
no
because
the
secretary's
interpretation
on
the
note
in
common
and
the
letter
submitted
to
the
educational
consultant
is
inconsistent
with
its
own
federal
regulation.
its
federal
reguation,
titled
children
placed
in
private
schools
when
fape
is
at
issue,
also
requires
that
you
previously
receive--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
exactly...
it
does.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
the
note--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
chief
justice,
if
it's
ambiguous
and
we
ought
to
at
least
discuss
the
nature
of
the
ambiguity,
then
that
ambiguity
under
the
spending
clause
should
redound
to
the
benefit
of
the
local
education
district
as
well,
for
if
it
does
not
set
forth--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
the
chevron
deference
requires
notes
and
comments
which
are
persuasive
and
analyzed.
there
is
absolutely
no
analysis
in
the
note
and
comment
in
this
case.
all
it
says
conclusively
is
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
burlington
and
carter
create
an
independent
obligation
separate
and
distinct
from
the
statute.
it
doesn't
explain
why
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
should
not
be
incorporated
in
the
burlington
court.
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
if
the...
if
the
child
attends
a
public
school
and
receives
special
education
and
related
services--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i...
i
thought,
i'm
sorry--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that...
that
would
satisfy
the
statutory
definition,
but
when
it
went
before
the
impartial
officer,
or
the
state
review
officer,
there
would
be
a
very
compelling
argument
that
there
was
a
lack
of
cooperation,
because
it's
not
just
that
you're
in
the
system,
but
that
you
articulate
the
problems
that
you
have
with
the
public
placement.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
my
only
comment,
chief
justice,
was
that
yes,
that
would
satisfy
the
statutory
section
as
long
as
the
notice
was
given
in
triple
i,
but
we
would
then
have
an
argument
in
the
individual
case
that
the
parent
was
not
cooperating.
so
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
where
they
come
into
the
system
even
for
a
minimum
period
and
give
the
appropriate
notice
under
triple
i,
yes,
that
would...
it
would
be
satisfied.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
the
reason
congress
wanted
to
provide
it
is
the
reason
that
this
court
discussed
in
burlington.
the
upset
of
this
court
in
burlington
was
that
it
was
an
extremely
protracted
process.
the
child
there
was
subject
to
a
very
long
impartial
hearing
and
state
review
and
court
review--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
the
reason--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct,
but
it's
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
says
that
you
must
receive
special
education
and
related
services.
there
is
no...
there
is
no
exception
to
the
condition...
if
you
look
at
the
particular
statute
when
they
refer
to
"may",
they
are
only
talking
about
the
relief
that
a
court
or
impartial
hearing
officer
or
state
review
officer
can
grant.
they
are
not
talking
about
the
predicate,
you
must
be
in
the
system.
now
you
asked,
justice
alito,
why
do
they
have
to
be
in
the
system,
and
the
reason
is
congress
thought
that
if
you're
in
the
system
and
you
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
system,
that
because
of
all
the
processes
that
are
there,
including
mediation,
including
a
modified
iep,
that
it
would
increase
the
numbers
of
people
in
terms
of
cooperation
who
want
to
participate
in
the
system.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i
think--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct.
he
never
had
any
contact
with
the
public
school
at
all
except
to
request
a
free
appropriate
public
education.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes,
but
you
don't
know
that
until
you've
actually
been
subjected
to
the
process
itself.
indeed
in
schaffer,
you,
this
court
said
that
you
had
to
presume
that
the
officials
in
the
department
of
education
of
a
local
school
district
are
going
to
do
their
job.
their
job
is
to
try
to
find
an
appropriate
iep.
if
it
turns
out
that
it's
insufficient,
of
course
you
can
then
litigate.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
but
if
we
don't...
if
the
public
schools
district
does
not
have
the
facilities,
then
it
will
consent
to
a
private
placement
to
deal
with
the
particular
problem
it
cannot
deal
with.
we
are
only
talking
about
cases
where
the
school
system
believes
it
can
deal
with
an
individual
problem
and
at
the
very
least
if
the
person's
child
comes
into
the
system,
they
will
have
the
opportunity
to
work
with
the
parent
and
try
to
work
out
a
situation.
in...
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
the
primary
obligation
is
to
find
a
public
education
for
this
child,
and
if
from
day
one
you
assume
that
the
individual
education
plan
is
defective,
not
only
is
it
inconsistent
with
schaffer,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
statutory
scheme
which
is
set
up
to
try
to
work
cooperatively.
indeed--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--the
parent
in
this
case
can
never
get
reimbursed
because
they
don't
meet
the
predicate
which
is
that
their
child
had
to
previously--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--oh
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
you
mean
assuming
the
statute
does
not
apply?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
and
congress
could
have
concluded
that
the
parent
you're
referring
to
who
placed
that
child
immediately
in
a
private
school,
and
who
may
not
have
an
interest
in
obtaining
a
public
school
education
for
that
child,
may
not
be
as
cooperative
and
as
collaborative
as
someone
who
has
a
child
in
the
system,
to
work
out
an
individual
education
plan
because
of
some
of
these--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
the
problem
is,
if
you
go
to
an
impartial
hearing
officer
as
in
this
case,
and
you
have
a
child
that's
been
in
a
private
school
for
a
number
of
years
and
is
doing
very
well,
and
the
private
school
special
ed
teacher
comes
in
and
highlights
all
the
successes
of
the
kid,
and
then
the
new
york
city
department
of
education
comes
in
with
is
profit
plan
which
is
based
on
speculation,
because
the
child
has
never
been
in
the
system,
is
it
so
unreasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
as
a
matter
of
statutory,
explicit
language
that
the
child
should
go
into
the
system
so
that
at
least
with
respect
to
your
burden
there's
at
least
a
participatory
program
where
they
try
to
help
the
child
get
an
individual
education.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
indeed,
justice
alito.
congress
in
this
case
got
it
completely
right
because
not
only
did
they
put
in
the
explicit
language,
they
also
put
in
a
time
period
because
they
understood
that
this
court
had
ruled
in
a
number
of
cases
that
its
upset
was
with
the
protracted
period
that
a
family
has
to
have
a
child
in
the
system.
but
by
having
a
notice
provision
and
by
thereby
ensuring
a
parent
that
by
giving
notice
and
specifically
articulating
the
reason
why
the
plan
is
deficient
and
giving
the
school
district
an
opportunity
to
cure
the
problem,
everybody
would
understand
10
days
later
that
they
can
leave.
so
the
very
problem
that
you
highlighted
in
burlington
and
carter
is
no
longer
a
problem
under
the
explicit
legislation.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
chief
judge,
you're
absolutely
right.
and
that
is
why
i
say
that
would
be
based
on
an
individual
determination.
all
the
statute
says
is
come
into
the
system.
what
happens
after
that,
if
you
give
your
notice
as
was
raised
in
a
hypothetical,
that
would
go
to
whether
or
not
there
was
the
duty
to
cooperate
which
was
fulfilled,
which
also
is
a
requirement
for
this
particular
section
for
reimbursement.
it's
not
just
that
you
are
in
a
program
and
private
school
is
providing
appropriate
service
and
then
you
have
an
iep
that
may
not
provide
the
free
appropriate
public
education,
but
you
also
have
to
show
you
cooperated
with
the
program
because
the
whole
primary
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
provide
a
public
education.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
that
is
correct,
but
your...
first
of
all,
congress
could
weigh
the
balance
between
that
particular
problem
and
the
need
to
give
the
school
district
an
opportunity
to
try
to
provide
a
program,
but
it
does
run
contrary
to
this
court's
discussion
in
schaffer
which
presumes
that
the
school
district
is
going
try
to
accommodate
the
child,
try
to
provide
the
needs
of
the
child.
in
effect,
i
think
all
of
these
questions
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
plan
is
going
to
be
automatically
deficient.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
foundation
this
court
has
indicated
there's
no
foundation.
that's
why
it
said
in
schaffer
that
the
parent
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
because
it
presumed
that
the
plan...
if
you
accept
that
principle,
which
has
already
been
articulated
and
you
accept
the
fact
that
specialists
on
the
board
of
education
have...
are
going
to
try
to
adjust
to
this
kid's
needs,
then
having
the
kid
in
the
system
even
for
a
short
while
is
something
that
congress
could
determine.
and
indeed
that's
what
the
language
says.
now,
we
recognize
that
there
is
an
absurd
argument,
but
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
understand
how
it
would
be
absurd
to
require
this
when
indeed
it
would
solve
the
problems
of
burlington
and
carter
because
it
makes
sure
that
if
a
parent
doesn't
want
to
stay
for
a
protracted
period,
it
doesn't
have
to
stay
and
then
they
can
litigate
later.
as
judge
alito
noted,
it
would
be
as
little
as
10
days.
i
mean
some
arguments...
some
of
the
arguments
i
should
at
least
mention
that
the
other
side
has
made:
the
chief...
in
the
second
circuit,
the
argument
was
that
there
was
an
ambiguity
because
the
word
0
wasn't
used.
so
if
i
may
use
the
example
that
an
individual
may
be
eligible
for
welfare
recipients...
welfare
benefits
if
that
individual
previously
received
food
stamps,
the
argument
would
be,
well,
that's
a
little
ambiguous
because
you
didn't
say
"only
received
food
stamps".
of
course,
the
condition
doesn't
have
to
have
"only"
and
it
probably
undermines
a
lot
of
statutes
that
congress
has
passed.
the
language
is
very,
very
clear.
the
second
argument
that
is
made
both
by
the
solicitor
general
and
respondent
is
that
there's
been
an...
implied
repeals
of
this
court's
decisions
in
burlington
and
carter.
but
an
implied
repeal
is
when
you
have
two
statutes
that
are
specific
and
the
latest
specific
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
earlier
specific
statute.
these
courts'
decisions
were
based
on
a
general
remedy
provision
and,
more
importantly,
this
statute
encompassed
what
this
court
held
because
it
provided
that
you
can
remove
your
child
once
in
the
system
and
the
notice
provision
provides
that
you
don't
have
to
be
in
the
system
very
long.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no.
but
it
was
a
holding
where
the
student
was
in
fact
receiving
special
education.
the
next
case,
of
course,
would
have
been
one
where
the...
now,
a
more
interesting
question
would
have
been
raised
if
you
had
(iii)
and
not
(ii).
if
you
only
had
the
notice
provision
where
congress
contemplates
you
have
to
be
in
the
system
to
give
notice,
and
i
came
to
this
court
and
i
said,
under
(iii),
congress
has
really
contemplated
you
have
to
at
least
be
in
the
system
for
a
short
amount
of
time.
you
didn't
have
(ii),
which
clarifies
exactly
what
congress
said,
and
this
court
would
have
to
then
consider
whether
or
not
(iii),
by
itself,
would
be...
would
create
enough
of
an
ambiguity
in
its
prior
decisions
or
whether
or
not
(iii)
could
be
enforced
without
referring
to
(ii)
because
why
do
you
give
notice?
think
about
the
result
in
this
case.
for
someone
in
the
system,
they
have
to
give
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
cure,
and
the
iep
can
be
modified.
if
you're
not
in
the
system
and
you
never
had
any
interest
in
the
system
and
you
sought
tuition
reimbursement,
you
would
have
less
of
a
bureaucratic
process.
there
would
be
a
preverse
incentive
to
stay
outside
the
system.
you
wouldn't
have
to
give
notice.
you
would
just
have
to--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
that
would--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
that
would
be
an
individual
determination,
chief
judge.
what
i'm
saying
though,
for
everybody
in
the
system,
it
doesn't
depend
on
an
impartial
hearing.
you
have
to
give
notice
before
you
get
to
the
next
step.
if
you're
outside
the
system,
you
don't
have
to
participate
in
any
process
other
than
to
seek
at
an
impartial
hearing
the
right
to
get
reimbursement.
so
that
actually
there's
less
bureaucratic
processes
outside
the
system,
and
there's
and
incentive
(1)
not
to
cooperate
and
(2)
just
to
marshal
all
your
arguments
in
the
impartial
hearing
and
hopefullyl
you're
going
to
prevail
and
get
the
payment
for
the
private
education;
whereas,
if
you're
in
the
system--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--except
for--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--but
there
is
a
dynamic
at
these
hearings
that,
if
you
come
in
and
that
you're
in
a
private
school
and
you
show
that
your
child
is
doing
well
in
the
private
school,
and
we
come
in
with
a
theoretical
plan
that
has
never
been
implemented,
there
is
going
to
be
a
dynamic
with
the
impartial
hearing
officer
who
will
tilt
towards
keeping
the
child--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--you're
right,
justice
ginsburg.
i
was
only
commenting
on
the
dynamic.
of
course,
we
would
try
to
show
it,
but
we
can't
show
it
based
on...
any
actual
interaction
with
the
child.
we
can't
show
we
observed
the
child
in
the
school
and
tried
to
make
the
following
modifications.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
yes.
that
is
the
technical
relationship.
that's
right.
i'm
talking
more
about--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
correct.
but,
of
course,
what
we're
saying
has
no
actual
practice.
but
all
this
is
separate
and
distinct
from
the
language
of
congress.
and
unless
that
language
is
observed,
it
does
require
that
you
have
to
previously
receive
special
education
related
services.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
well,
then,
your
honor,
that
comes
under
section
b
of
the
same
section,
20
u.s.c.
1412(a)(10)(b),
where
the
school
district
does
not
believe
it
can
provide
the
service,
then
it
will
consent
to
a
private
school
and
will
give
reimbursement
because
that
will
be
the
equivalent
of
the
free
appropriate
public
education.
we
are
just
talking
about
cases
where
there
has
not
yet
been...
where
the
school
believes
they
can
provide
it.
the
parent
and
the
child
disagree.
now,
there
are
two
other
arguments
that
i
want
to
address.
one,
recognizing
that
the
language
seems
to
support
the
petitioner's
position.
they
argue
that,
in
fact,
they
did
get
special
education
and
related
services
because
for
the
years
1997
and
1998
and
1998-1999,
we
settled
with
them
and
we
did
pay
the
tuition.
but
paragraph
17
of
each
of
those
agreements
specifically
provided
that
the
settlement
was
not
to
create
any
admission
for
future
applications.
and
as
this
court
is
aware,
both
under
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
its
decisions
in
arizona
v.
colorado
and
the
u.s.
first
international
building
company,
if
you
settle,
it
has
no
probative
value.
all
you
do
is
settle
the
specific
claim.
you
don't
settle
the
legal
issue.
the
second
argument
they
make
is,
well,
we
have
got
an
iep.
an
iep
is
a
proposal
of
how
we
would
service
the
child.
and
that
iep
would
constitute
a
special
education
and
related
service.
but
an
iep
which
the
parent
rejects
could
never
be
a
special
education
related
system.
you
have
to
be
in
the
system
receiving
it.
and
indeed,
in
section
1414
of
u.s.c.,
it
specifically
provides
if
you
reject
the
iep,
you've
waived
any
right
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
so
once
you
do
that,
it
ends
the
discussion.
i
have
a
few
minutes
and
i'm
going
to
reserve
that
time
for
a
possible
reply.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
this
particular
provision,
as
the
chief
justice
noted,
is
called
payment
for
private
school
placements
where
they
don't
have
the
consent
of
the
local
education.
any
reasonable
reading
of
that
is
that
it's
all
encompassing.
and
any
person
who
has
to
apply
has
to
satisfy
those
provisions.
second,
this
statute
did
not
overrule
burlington
or
carter.
in
those
cases
the
children
were
already
receiving
special
services.
now
it
could
be
in
a
future
case
someone
would
speak
to
extend
those
cases,
but
congress
has
now
spoken
to
make
sure
that
burlington
and
carter
go
no
further
than
you
have
previously
held.
third,
there
is
an
assumption
that
the
program
is
going
to
be
defective
from
day
one.
but
that's
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
schaffer
which
presumes
the
good
faith
of
the
individuals
who
propose
in
program.
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
entire
case.
fourth,
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
someone
can
create
an
ambiguity
in
this
case.
citing
the
arlington
case,
in
which
you
placed
yourself
in
the
position
of
the
local
education
officer,
when
you
look
at
this
particular
section...
and
particularly
c
double...
double
i
and
triple
i.
would
you,
in
that
position,
understand
that
it
doesn't
really
mean
what
it
says,
that
previously
received
special
education
services
was
only
meant
to
cover
the
people
already
in
the
system
and
was
not
intended
to
cover
people
outside
the
system.
that
isn't
what
it
says.
more
importantly,
the
ambiguity
is
clearly
not
obvious.
so
how
would
a
local
officer
who
has
to
understand
whether
or
not
to
place
the
funds
at
risk
know
whether
or
not
in
complying
with
this
particular
situation,
it
was
explicit
or
implicit?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
i
think
so.
i
think,
because
of
burlington
and
carter,
where
the
children
were
already
in
the
system,
this
would
be
the
next
step.
would
we
have
presented
to
you
the
fact
that
you
shouldn't
expand
it?
probably.
would
i
know
what
you
would
conclude?
no,
but
the
statute
eliminated
that
entire
discussion.
it
is
clear.
but
again,
there
is
a
very
big
spending
clause...
as
i
mentioned
in
my
earlier
presentation,
if
it's
so
ambiguous
that
you
can
read
out
a
specific
provision,
how
can
that
ambiguity
not
go
down
to
the
benefit
of
the
city
through
it's
local
education
system?
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
the...
this
is
just
a
grant
provision,
your
honor.
it's
not
premised
on
any
constitutional
provision.
it's
a
grant
where
funds
are
provided
to
the
local
education
district,
and
in
return
they
agree
to
comply
with
all
the
conditions
set
forth
in
the
idea.
there
are
no
constitutional
limits.
thank
you
very
much.
