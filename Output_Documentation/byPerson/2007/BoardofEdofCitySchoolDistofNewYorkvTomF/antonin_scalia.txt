justice
antonin
scalia
you've
added
something
to
the
question,
though,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
attending
public
school
and
receiving--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
it
wasn't
that.
i
thought
it
was
simply
congress
figured
that
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
people
in
new
york
city,
in
manhattan
in
particular,
who
are
going
to
send
their
kids
to
private
school,
no
matter
what,
and
they
can
get
special
services
in
private
school,
but
what
the
heck,
if
we
can
get
$30,000
from
the
city
to
pay
for
it,
that's
fine.
in
other
words,
this
was
meant
to
be
an
option
for
people
who
wanted
to
go
to
the
public
schools
but
couldn't
go
to
the
public
schools
because
they
couldn't
get
the
private
services
there,
but
it
was
never
meant
to
be
an
option
for
people
who
had
no
desire
to
go
to
public
schools
at
all
anyway,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
without
this
condition,
somebody,
i
think
the
plaintiff
here
was
never
in
the
public
school,
was
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
is...
but
the
parent
would
not
have
to
show
that
the
parent
would
have
used
that
available
public
remedy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
were
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
to
be
fair,
this
provision
doesn't
just
apply
to
the
rich
person
who
wants
new
york
city
to
pay
30,000
of
his
tuition
to
a
private
school.
it
also
applies
to
somebody
who
is
already
in
public
school,
and
the
program
offered
by
the...
by
the
city
is
patently
inadequate.
you
are
compelling
the
parent
nonethe
less
to
put
the
kid
in
a
program
that
anybody
would
see
will...
will
not
meet
the
needs.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
parent
would
presumably
cover
themselves,
look
it,
he's
getting
x,
y...
x,
y,
and
z
in
the
private
school
and
you're
going
to
give
him
z;
z
is
not
going
to
be
enough.
and
the
burden
on
you
would
be
upon
you
to
say,
oh,
we
think
z
is
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
it
do,
then?
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
it
makes
it
very
clear
it
is,
it
is
(ii)
which
authorizes
the
enrollment
in
a
private
school
and
payment
for
that.
and
it
is
prefaced
with
a
condition:
if
the
parents
of
a
child
with
a
disability
who
previously
received
special
education
and
related
services
under
the
authority
of
the
public
agency,
enroll
the
child
in
a
private...
the
implication
is
if
there
were
parent
of
a
child
who
was
not
so
enrolled,
this
provision
does
not
apply.
so
then
you
fall
back
on
the
fact
that
the
old
provision
covered
in
our
cases
would
have
applied
but
that
makes
this
meaningless.
i
mean
if
you
say
that
our
prior
cases
overrode
that
limitation,
then
what
purpose
does
the
limitation
serve?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
else
does
it
say
that
the
city
will
pay
for
the
cost
of
a
private
education
except
there?
that's
the
only
place
it
says
it.
and
part
of
the
requirements
for
getting
it
is
that
the
child
was
receiving
service
at
a
public
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
agree...
im
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
you
that
you
could
get
special
services
which...
in
third
grade
and
then
come
back
10
years
later
and
get
private
school
tuition.
i
would
really
read
this
as
saying
if
the
parents
of
a
child
who
previously
received
special
education
under
the
authority,
enroll
the
child
in
a
public
elementary
school...
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
temporal
connection
between
the
prior
receipt
and
the
enrollment.
i
don't
think
you
can
go
back
10
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
read
it
that
way,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
you're
in
the
private
school
reimbursement
you're
in
the
private
school
reimbursement,
but
you
can't
get
into
it
10
years
later.
anyway,
that
issue
is
not...
not
before
us
today.
i
don't
understand
you
assertion
that
somehow
this
would
amount
to
repeal
by
implication.
the
provision
of
1415...
what
is
it,
(b),
(b)(3)...
it
seems
to
me
is
just
like
a
provision
for,
for
a
court's
exercise
of
its
equitable
powers.
"shall
grant
such
relief
as
the
court
determines
is
appropriate.
"
--if
a
court
had
granted
some
equitable
relief
in
one
case,
and
then
there
is
a
statute
that's
passed
which
renders
that
equitable
relief
no
longer
appropriate,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that...
that
that
amounts
to
a
repeal
by
implication.
it's
just
that
what
is
appropriate
depends
upon
the
remainder
of
the
statue,
and
as
it
exists
at
the
time
that
the
relief
is
sought.
justice
antonin
scalia
bingo.
you
got
me
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
he
hasn't...
he
hasn't
said
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
a
different
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
interpreting
some
very
general
language:
"shall
grant
such
relief
as
the
court
determines
is
appropriate.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
so
does
the
10-business-days
notice
requirement
for
people
who
are
in
public
schools
also
violate
burlington,
because
for
10
business
days
they
are
going
to
be
subject
to
an
inappropriate
education?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
no
problem.
i
mean
both
sides
agree
that
you
can
move
to
a
private
school
if
that's
so;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
those...
there
are
a
lot
of
parents
who
are
going
to
send
their
parents
to
private
school,
no
matter
what.
they
are
well-heeled
and
this
is
just
an
opportunity
to
have
new
york
city
pay
$30,000
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
the
child
who
would
turn
down
the
adequate
education
provided
by
the
public
schools.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
don't
have
an
adequate
placement,
they
should
not
have
to
pay
the
freight
for
people
who
would
not
be
coming
to
public
school
any
way.
that's
what
this
provision
prevents.
