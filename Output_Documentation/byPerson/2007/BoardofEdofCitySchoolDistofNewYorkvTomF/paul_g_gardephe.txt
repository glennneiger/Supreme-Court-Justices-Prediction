mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
a
child
with
a
learning
disability
has
been
denied
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education,
which
is
what
happened
here,
idea
authorizes
an
award
of
private
school
tuition
reimbursement,
whether
or
not
the
child
previously
receives
special
education
related
services
under
the
authority
of
a
public
agency.
the
board's
argument
that
it
can
both
deny
space
and
remain
not
liable
for
private
school
tuition
reimbursement
is
not
compatible
with
the
statute
or
with
this
court's
jurisprudence.
1412(a)(10)(c)(ii)
did
not
overrule
burlington
and
did
not
impose
the
hobson's
choice
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
your
honor,
congress
was
focused
on
the
public
school
context.
and
the
language
in
(c)(ii),
which
refers
to
previously
received,
is
intended
as
a
setup
for
(c)(iii).
when
you
get
to
(c)(iii),
you
get
the
notice
requirements.
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that's
why
the
reference
is
there.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
your
honor,
the
first
question
is
whether
that
is
intended
to
be
exclusive.
and
i
don't
think
it
was,
because
the
"only
if"
language
is
not
there.
and
the
idea
in
multiple
places.
and
congress
knew
how
to
say
only
if
it
intended,
if
it
intended--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--your
honor,
congress
did
not
intend
that
exclusive
language.
if
it
had,
it
would
have
used
the
"only
if"
language.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
because,
your
honor,
the
context
is
public
school.
that
is
the
situation
that
congress
was
seeking
to
address,
and
that's
why
you
have--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--yes.
if
you
look
at
(c)(iii),
your
honor,
it
obviously
repeatedly
refers
to
prior
to
the
removal
of
a
child
from
the
public
school.
so
congress
was
clearly
focused
on
and
it
was
intending
to
give
guidance
to
the
courts
in
their
equitable...
in
exercising
their
equitable
powers.
so
in
the
context
of
a
child
who
was
in
public
school,
these
are
the
types
of
notice
and
cooperation
things
the
court
should
take
into
consideration.
the
question,
your
honor,
is
whether
they
intended
this
to
be
the
exclusive
vehicle
by
which
tuition
reimbursement
could
be
obtained?
and
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
no.
and
the
reason
why
the
answer
is
no
is
because
there
is
no
"only
if"
language.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
because
the
question
is,
does
that
language
serve
any
purpose?
and
my
answer
to
that,
the
language
in
(c)(ii),
"previously
had
received",
yes,
it
serves
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is
it
gives
factual
context
for
what
comes
in
(c)(iii).
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
say--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
provides
the
context
for
what
follows
in
(c)(iii).
the
context
it
provides
is--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--no,
your
honor.
the
point
of
that
language
is
to
provide
the
backdrop
for
(c)(iii)
where
congress
did
intend
to
give
guidance
to
courts
in
the
exercise
of
the
equitable--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
the
question
is
whether...
it
really
boils
down
to
if
congress
intends
to
address
the
full--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--but,
your
honor,
(c)(ii)
is
not
exhaustive.
let
me
give
an
example.
i'm
sure
this
court
would
agree
that
the
requirement,
the
second
requirement
in
burlington
that
the
private
placement
has
to
be
appropriate
is
the
law
in
this
land.
and
(c)(ii)
doesn't
set
forth
that
requirement.
(c)(ii)
does
not
set
forth
that
requirement.
and
what
that
says
to
me
is
that
(c)(ii)
was
never
intended
by
congress
to
be
exhaustive.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
probative
on
the
issue
of
whether
congress
intended
(c)(ii)
to
set
forth
the
requirements
for
private
school
tuition
reimbursement
and
all
the
factual
context
in
which
that
could
be
rendered.
i
do
want
to
address
one
point,
which
is
that
did
congress
deal
with
this
issue
later?
that
is
to
say,
in
terms
of
the
notice
factors
that
it
set
forth
in
(c)(iii),
which
i
have
argued
to
you
applied
to
parents
whose
children
have
been
in
public
school.
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is,
yes,
they
did.
they
addressed
it
in
1415(f)(1)(b),
which
require
the
2004
amendments
to
idea.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
1415(f)(1)(b)...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
it's
not
in
the
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
but
at
1415(f)(1)(b),
your
honor,
what
that
provision
requires
is
that
parents,
prior
to
a
due
process
hearing,
must
meet
with
the
iep
team,
they
must
meet
with
the
school
district,
they
must
lay
out
their
complaints
about
the
iep,
and
the
statute
provides
give
the
school
district
an
opportunity
to
resolve
the
complaint.
so
congress
did
not
deal
with
the
full
waterfront
in
the
1997
amendments.
it
returned
to
this
issue
in
2004
and
imposed
those
notice
and
cooperation
requirements
that,
as
i've
argued
to
you--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--these
were
2004
amendments,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
your
honor,
i
believe
it
begins
with
1400(d)(1)(a)
and
1412(a)(1);
both
of
which
impose
the
requirement
on
school
districts
to
make
available
the
free
and
appropriate
public
education
for
the
child.
i
believe
it
begins
there.
it
then
continues
to
1415
(i)(2)(c)(3),
which
is
the
provision
that
grants
courts
to...
sorry,
grants
such
relief
as
the
court
determines
is
appropriate.
there
is
no
evidence
either
in
the
1997
amendments
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
there
was
an
intent
to
appeal
or
override
that
remedy.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
with
respect
to
the
children
in
the
public
school
system,
if
you
read
(c)(3)...
and
again
these
are
permissive...
but
if
(c)(3)
is
applied,
then
i
think
representative
castle's
comments
make
perfect
sense
because
they
provide
for
certain
notice
obligations.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
there
was
case
law
preceding
the
1997
amendments
that
imposed
reasonableness
reasonableness
and
cooperation
requirements
on
parents
even
before
the
1997
amendments
came
into
effect.
as
i
did
mention,
after
2004
those
requirements
were
now
statutory,
but
the
reality
is
as
a
matter
of
case
law,
it
was
already
very
clear
in
1997
that
if
you
didn't
give
notice
to
the
school
district,
if
you
didn't
cooperate
in
the
formation
of
an
iep,
you
were
not
going
to
get
tuition
reimbursement.
and
of
course
that
flows
directly
from,
in
particular,
carter's
statement
that
the
reimbursement
remedy
is
subject
to
equitable
considerations.
so
it
has
always
been
the
law
that
if
a
parent
does
not
cooperate,
does
not
give
notice,
does
not
cooperate
in
the
formation
of
an
iep,
that
they
will
not
get...
or
that
the
court
has
the
discretion
to
deny
the
tuition
reimbursement
remedy.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
never
intended,
to
quote
justice
scalia,
that
parents
would
be
required
to
place
their
child
in
a
patently
inappropriate
placement
in
order
to
qualify
for
tuition
reimbursement,
and
to
address
justice
alito's
point,
your
honor,
we
don't
know...
whether
it's
10
days
or
11
days
or
1
day...
we
don't
know.
we
can
draw
some
guidance,
i
suppose,
from
the
ten-day
requirement
in
(c)(3),
but
that's
by
no
means
clear.
the
parents
can
give
notice
ten
days
before
the
school
day
begins...
a
school
year
began...
that
they
find
the
placement
inappropriate.
so
this--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--but
your
honor,
it
highlights
that
if
they
can
place
the
child
in
for
one
day,
this
is
an
utterly
meaningless
provision
that
congress
never
could
have
intended
to
require
because
it
serves
no
purpose.
and
that's--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--let
me
give
an
example
that
highlights
my
point.
i
place
my
child
in
the
kindergarten
in
public
school
for
one
day.
i
then
satisfy
the
statute,
previously
have
received
special
education-related
services.
five
years
later
i
can
still
rely
on
that.
ten
years
later,
i
can
still
rely
on
that.
it's
a
talisman.
it
can't--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--it
doesn't
serve
any
useful
purpose,
your
honor,
and
if
it
doesn't
serve
any
useful
purpose
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
it
to
have
that
effect.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
this
court
has
addressed
that
balance
in
burlington,
and
the
answer
was
no,
the
statute
does
not
require
that
parents
place
their
child
in
an
inappropriate
place.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
but
again,
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
that
amendment
that
it
was
intended
to
be
exclusive
or
intended
to
be
exhaustive
of
the
circumstances
and
factual
context.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
let
me
go
back--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--let
me
address
that,
your
honor.
what
that
would
mean,
then,
i
suppose,
is
that
parents
would
be
required
each
year
to
put
their
child
in
a
public
school
for
some
period
of
time
to
qualify,
and
then
place
their
kid
in
private
school
if
they
didn't...
and
then
you're
talking
about
a
disruption--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--the
point
we
are
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
in
light
of
burlington,
which
obviously
congress
had
knowledge
of
when
it
enacted
the
1997
amendments,
is
it
credible
to
believe
that
they
would
have
restricted,
limited,
overruled
the
holding
of
burlington,
and
never
said
a
word
about
it?
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
a
tryout
period.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
it's
not
just
language.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
and
it's
the
context
that
flows
from
burlington,
where
the
congress
was
aware
that
this
court--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
understanding
(b),
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
right.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
right.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
in
a
perfect
world,
your
honor,
school
districts
who
are
confronted
with
a
situation
would
always
make
the
decision
to
place
the
child
in
private
schools
at
public
expense,
but
unfortunately
there
are
disagreements
between
school
districts
and
parents
about
what
is
appropriate,
and
then
sometimes
school
districts
don't
do
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
under
the
statute
and
in
fact
the
city's
interpretation
here
would
incentivize
school
districts
not
to
provide
services
because
if
they
never
provided
services
they
wouldn't
be
liable
for
the
reimbursement.
again,
this
can't
be
what
congress
intended.
i
did
want
to
back
up
my
assertion
about
the
only--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--your
honor,
that
relies
on
the
good
faith
of
the
school
district.
(b)
relies
on,
(a)(10)(b)
and
b
relies
on
the
good
faith
of
the
school
district
to
make
a
determination
that
they
can't
provide
the
services.
that's
not
always
going
to
happen.
there
may
be...
there
may
be
a
disagreement
about
whether
they
can
provide
the
services
or
not
between
the
school
district
and
the
parents.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
yes,
your
honor.
obviously,
the
parents
contend
both
that
the
plan
was
not
appropriate,
and
that
it
wasn't
offered
in
good
faith.
but
i...
i
did
want
to
back
up
my
assertion
on
the
"only
if"
language
and...
and
recite
some
statutory
references.
because
i
believe
it
stems
very
clearly
from
the
statute
when
you
go
through
the
provisions.
1415(f)(3)(e
)(ii),
1414(a)(1)(c)ii,
1411(b)(1)(a
),
1401(19)(c),
1415(k)(4)(c)
in
the
'98
version
of
the
statute,
1413--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
congress
knew
how
to
say
"only
if".
they
didn't
do
that
here,
because
they
had
no
intention
of
creating
an
exclusive
remedy.
and
this
court
said
in
winkelman
that
courts
should
be
cautious
in
reading
into
the
statute
an
implicit
limitation,
and
this
limitation
goes
to
what
the
court
also
said
in
winkelman
is
the
primary
mandate.
finally,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--the
primary
mandate
was
to
provide
or...
or
make
available
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education
to
every
child
with
learning
disabilities.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
at
second
circuit
appendix
168.
the
school
district
here
said
tnat
the
child's
disabilities
could
not
be
addressed
in
a
mainstream
setting,
so
there
is
no
mainstream
issue
here.
finally,
your
honors,
when
congress
here
chose
to
carve
out
populations
of
children,
it
did
that
in
a
very,
very
direct
way.
it
did
that
in
1412(a)(1)(b)
where
it
lays
out
very
limited
exceptions
for
children
who
do
not
receive
the
guarantee
with
respect
to
a
free
and
appropriate
public
education.
the
limitation
is
very,
very
clear.
it's
very,
very
limited
to
certain
age
groups
where
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
state
law,
or
there
is
an
incarcerated
child.
but
there
is
no
other
place
that
congress
carved
out
populations
of
children
other
than
in
1412(a)(1)(b),
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
in
a
backdoor
fashion
to
carve
out
the
populations
of
children,
some
of
which
were
mentioned
in
the
argument
of
my
adversary.
congress
was
aware--
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
--your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
paul
g.
gardephe
thank
you.
