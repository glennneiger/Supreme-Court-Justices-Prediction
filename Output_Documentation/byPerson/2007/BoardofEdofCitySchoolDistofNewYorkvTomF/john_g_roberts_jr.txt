chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-637,
board
of
education
of
the
city
school
district
of
the
city
of
new
york
v.
tom
f..
mr.
koerner.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
agree
that
if
we
conclude
the
language
is
ambiguous,
we
should
defer
to
the
secretary's
interpretation
in
the
comments
accompanying
the
regulations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
just
mirrors
the
statute--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--assuming
we
would
think
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous,
we
are
likely
to
think
the
same
language
in
the
regulation
is
ambiguous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which...
which
prevails,
chevron
deference
or
spending
clause
presumption?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances.
i
mean,
if
the
parent
is
able
to
show
look,
the
school
district
is
being
very
unreasonable
here;
it's
clear
he
is
going
to
need
more
than
the
services
they
were
going
to
offer,
well
that
wouldn't
have--
mr.
koerner.
yes.
--run
afoul
of
any
of
the
other
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
they
may...
they
may
well
have
to
stay
longer
than
10
days
to
either
realize
that
the
program
is
inadequate
or
to
feel
comfortable
that
they'll
be
able
to
establish
that
on
the
record.
it's
pretty
hard
to
say
something's
not
working
after
only
on
10
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
because
the
problem
would
be
you
would
go
to
the
hearing
to
see
if
you
were
getting
the
adequate
education
and
you
would
have...
you
would
essentially
have
to
make
a
facial
challenge
rather
than
an
as-applied
one,
and
the
school
would
say,
well,
you
didn't
give
us
a
chance;
we
were
going
to
do
this
and
we
were
going
to
do
that.
so
it
would
be
a
heavier
burden
to
carry.
the
parents
would
have
a
heavier
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
they
did--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
my
suggestion
is
still
that
it
would
be
easier
to
prevail
at
the
impartial
hearing,
if
you
can
say,
look,
we
tried,
it
didn't
work,
as
opposed
to
saying,
we
never
even
tried.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
i
were
the
impartial
hearing
examiner,
i
would
think
that
that's
a
harder
burden
for
the
parents
to
carry
if
they
didn't
even
try.
the
school's
going
to
come
in
and
say,
here's
what
we
would
have
done
if
you'd
given
us
a
chance
and
you
didn't
give
us
a
chance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
koerner.
mr.
gardephe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
read...
hypothesize
two
statutes:
one,
the
statute
before
the
phrase
"who
previously
received
special
education"
was
added
and
the
statute
after?
you
read
both
of
those
statutes
the
same
way;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand.
you
read
"who
previously
received
special
education
services.
"
and
you
say
that
includes
who
previously
did
not
receive
special
education
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
congress
to
put
that
language
in
if
the
same
right
to
reimbursement
existed
if
the
child
had
not
previously
received
special
education
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
your
friend
reads
that
the
exact
opposite
way
and
says,
since
(c)(iii)
only
makes
sense
if
the
child
is
in
the
public
school,
that
that's
a
limitation
on
how
you
should
read
(c)(ii).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
that
case,
isn't
it
pertinent
that
the
title
to
(c)(ii)
says
"reimbursement
for
private
school
placement"?
it
doesn't
say
reimbursement
for
private
school
placement
when
the
child
previously
attended
public
school.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
just
means
that
(c)(ii)
doesn't
address
the
entire
universe
of
issues
that
might
arise.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
doesn't
address
exactly
what
its
title
says,
"reimbursement
for
private
school
placement".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
set
forth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
those
provisions
at
issue
when
this
dispute
arose?
they
are
the
2004
amendments--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
it's
how
broadly
you
read
legislative
history.
i
thought
there
was
a
statement
by
representative
castle
that
this
would
limit
the
payments
that
school
districts
had
to
make.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
it
comes
to
reimbursement
of
tuition,
the
parents
who
never
place
their
child
in
the
public
school
are
in
better
shape
than
the
parent
who
place
their
child
in
public
school
and
then
want
to
remove
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
cooperation
does
not
require
sending
the
child
to
the
public
school.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
in
my
case
they
would
note
have
received
any
benefits,
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
why
your
friend
says
it
serves
the
purpose
of
helping
to
make
clear
that
the
public
school
is...
whether
it
is
or
is
not
able
to
provide
the
appropriate
public
education.
i
mean,
why
would
congress
have
put
the
phrase
in
there...
even
if
it
was
describing
as
you
say
the
most
common
situation...
why
would
it
put
the
phrase
in
there
if
it
doesn't
serve
that
purpose
at
least?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
it's
not
a
very
significant
hurdle,
but
it
is
going
to
be
a
hurdle
in
some
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
useful
purpose
it
serves
is
allow
the
school
district
to
show
what
it
can
do
in
ten
days,
as
opposed
to
a
mere
theoretical
statement,
it
allows
some
actual
concrete
practice
to
see
if
the
plan
that
the
public
school
has
developed
is
going
to
work
or
not
going
to
work,
that
the
impartial
hearing
examiner
can
evaluate
in
a
more
concrete
setting.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
the
whole
point
is
the
statute
was
then
amended
after
burlington.
so
to
say
what
burlington
interpreted,
it
don't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
compelling
on
the
question
of
what
the
amended
statute
provided.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
review
before
the
impartial
hearing
examiner
about
that
alleged
bad
faith,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
reviewed
before
the
hearing
examiner
that
alleged
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
school
district.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
was
that
primary
mandate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
no
issue
of
mainstreaming
in
this
case
at
all;
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
neither
of
the
options
are
mainstream
options?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
it...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
mine.
thank
you,
mr.
gardephe.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
a
situation
where
it's
not
in
the
summer,
where
they
say,
well,
let's
see
how
it
works,
and
then
they
go
to
the
public
school,
i
would
have
thought
your
argument
also
would
say
it's
not...
they
don't
have
to
give
notice
of
10
business
days
because
in
burlington
you
said
you
don't...
you
have
to
make
available
the
tuition
reimbursement.
they
passed
a
statute
imposing
a
limitation
on
that,
10
business
days.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
dispute
that
limitation.
you
dispute
the
other
one,
though,
which
says
they
have
to
have
previously
received
special-education
services.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
anywhere?
i
thought
representative
castle
said
that
this
would
result
on
easing
the
burden
on
the
school
districts
to
pay
tuitions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
whole
point
is
you
don't
necessarily
know
it's
inadequate
until
later
in
time.
right?
the
school
board
thinks
it
is
adequate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
koerner,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
koerner.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
06-637,
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
new
york
versus
tom
f,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
the
case.
