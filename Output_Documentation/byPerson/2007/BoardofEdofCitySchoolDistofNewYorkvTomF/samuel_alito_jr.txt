justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
gilbert
f.
had
attended
the
public
school
for
11
days,
would
this
case
come
out
differently,
in
your
view?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
student
here
had
attended
the
public
school
for
let's
say
11
days
before
being
transferred
to
the
public...
to
the
private
school,
would
your,
would
your
arguments
still
fly?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
was
my
assumption.
let's
say
he
attends
public
school
in
a
special
education
class
for
11
days.
his
parents
think
the
public...
the
placement
that's
proposed,
the
iep
that's
proposed
by
the
school
is
inadequate,
and
they
turn
out
to
be
correct,
and
they
want
to
send
their
child
to
the
private
school,
but
they
understand
this
argument
based
on
the
statutory
language,
so
they
say
all
right,
we
are
going
to
put
him
in
the
public
school
special
education
class
for
11
days,
so...
we've
already
got
the
placement
in
the
private
school
all
lined
up
at
the
end
of
the
11
days.
he
goes
one
day,
we
give
notice;
we
take
him
out
and
we
put
him
in
the
private
school;
then
they
are
entitled
to
reimbursement
subject
under
your
argument.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
congress
ever
have
wanted
to
adopt
a
scheme
like
that?
what
possible
purpose
is
served
by
simply
requiring
the
student
to
be
in
a
placement
that
is
by
definition
not
providing
a...
not
providing
fape
for
this
very
short
period
of
time?
it
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
congress's
purpose
really
was
what
you...
what
you
suggest
and
what
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
suggests,
that
there
was
a
desire
to
make
parents
who
really
had
no
interest
in
the
public
school
system
give
the
public
schools
a
chance,
why
is
it
that,
even
as
you
read
the
statute,
there's
no
requirement
that
the
child
remain
in
the
public
school
system
for
any
significant
period
of
time?
it's
just
pro
forma.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
there
any
suggestion
in
the
reasoning
in
the
burlington
case
that
it
was
limited
to
a
situation
in
which
the
student
had
been
receiving
public
school
special
education?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
during
the
period
between
burlington
and
the
enactment
of
this
statute,
would
you
have
any
doubt
about
your
potential
obligation
to
reimburse
a
parent...
during
the
period
of
burlington
and
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
would
the
school
board
have
had
doubt
about
its
potential
liability
for
reimbursement,
in
a
situation
like
this?
