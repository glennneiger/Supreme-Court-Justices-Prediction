justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it
doesn't
remain
dirty
simply
because
it
goes
to
a
place
in
which
the
appearance
of
this
kind
of
cash
does
not
have
the
dirty
appearance
that
it
does
at
home.
why...
why
isn't
that
the
correct
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
that
make
it
laundering?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
design
to
conceal...
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
hypo,
but
i
thought
the
design
to
conceal
was
you
conceal
the
dirty
character
of
the
money
by
taking
it
to
a
place
and
using
it
in
that
place
where
use
of
large
amounts
of
cash,
whether
for
bank
deposits
or
spending
in
luxury
stores,
does
not
have
the
dirty
implication,
the
dirty
appearance
that
it
does
in
the
united
states.
so,
why
doesn't
that
therefore
satisfy
the
concealment?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
all
they
were
getting
at,
they
wouldn't
have
to
have
this
international
component
at
all,
because
if
you
totally
eliminated
the
"to
or
through"
requirement
and
you
were
able
to
focus
or
properly
focus
solely
on
the
method
of
the
transportation,
et
cetera,
then
you
would
cover
not
only
cases
in
which
the
concealment
ultimately
would
take
place
by
crossing
a
border,
but
you
would
pick
up
cases
in
which
the
concealment
would
take
place
even
within
the
united
states;
and
that
would
certainly
be
in
the
government's
interest.
but
if
you
add,
if
you
say,
well,
but
this
is
limited
by
a
to
or
through
requirement,
then
it
suggests,
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
breyer's
question
does,
that
it
must...
the
statute
must
be
getting
at
what
happens
when
it
crosses
the
border
as
opposed
to
the
means
of
crossing.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
would
be...
that
would
be
equally
true
and
an
equally
appropriate
objective
without
the
"to
or
through"
requirement
in
there.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
have
the
"to
or
through"
requirement
in
order
to
give
the
government
a
tool
for
exactly
the
purpose
that
you
describe.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
he
gives
it
to
his
brother
and
says
take
it
across
for
me,
will
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
he
tells
his
brother
to
put
it
in
his
shoe?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
i
suppose
then
the
brother
should
be...
giving
the
money
to
the
brother
should
satisfy
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
if
i'm...
if
i'm
in
the
drug
business
and
my...
my
brother
is
an
international
social
worker
or
something,
i'm
certainly
going
to
conceal
when
i
give
it
to
him
and
he
carries
it
across
the
border.
