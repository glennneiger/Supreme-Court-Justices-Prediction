mr.
jerry
v.
beard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1956,
the
money
laundering
statute,
requires
an
intent
to
minimize
the
criminal
taint
of
unlawful
proceeds.
but
the
statute
does
not
criminalize
concealing
money's
existence.
in
this
case,
mr.
cuellar's
conviction
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons.
first,
while
the
method
of
the
transportation
involved
may
have
been
designed
to
conceal,
the
transportation
itself
was
not.
secondly,
while
cuellar
may
have
in
fact
concealed
money
itself,
he
did
not
conceal
the
nature,
source,
location,
ownership
or
control
of
the
unlawful
proceeds.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
chief
justice,
in
the
broader
sense
location
was
concealed.
the
point
to
be
taken
here
i
think
is
this:
an
examination
of
the
text
itself
reveals
particular
listed
attributes,
and
location
numbers
among
them.
but
what
this
suggests,
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
design
to
conceal
or
to
disguise
these
particular
attributes,
necessarily
means
a
plan,
if
you
will,
for
those...
excuse
me...
for
those
attributes
to
be
presented
either
to
law
enforcement
if
they
intercept
the
money
or
inject
it
into
legitimate
commerce
later.
in
other
words,
they'll
be
observed
later.
location
has
independent
meaning,
but
it's
also
understood
within
the
context
of
the
words
that
surround
it.
all
money
changes
location,
whether
concealed
or
not.
location
in
this
context
means
more
than
the
location
that
the
money
was
found
in
the
car.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
yes,
justice--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--no,
justice
breyer;
you're
correct.
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
the
method
of
transportation
and
the
transportation
itself.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
difference
is
certainly
implicated.
what
we
understand
the
government
to
be
arguing
is
that
the
method
of
the
transportation
satisfies
the
listed
attributes.
but
if
that
were
the
case
it
would
effectively
render
all
transportation
of
funds
necessarily
to
be
money
laundering.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
justice
stevens,
what
i'm
referring
to
is
certainly
that
it
was
in
a
car,
but
there
was
a
secret
compartment,
goat
hair
was
sprinkled
around
to
try
to
throw
off
drug
detection
dogs,
and
those
type
of
characteristics.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
what
we're
looking
at
here
is
that
the
design
of
the...
the
fact
mr.
cuellar
may
or
may
not
have
known,
for
example,
who
owned...
where
the
money
was
coming
from
or
who
owned
it,
that
doesn't
go
to
the
design
of
the
transportation.
the
design
of
the
transportation
itself
is
just
to
get
the
money
to
mexico.
i
can
say
that
abstractly,
but
in
this
case
in
particular
because
we
know
from
the
government's
evidence
that
what
this
was
was
essentially
the
last
leg
of
a
drug
trafficking
deal.
we
know
that
this
was
repayment.
so
in
this
particular
case
at
least,
the
purpose
of
this
transportation
was
to
get
this
money
back
as
repayment
money.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
justice,
if
he
was
bringing--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--well,
presumably,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
but
of
course,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
he
would
possess
marijuana
at
that
time.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
we
have
suggested
that
mr.
cuellar's,
liability,
liability
or
culpability,
lie
more
properly
under
the
bulk
cash
smuggling
statute.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
yes,
you're
correct
that
it
would
require
inference
as
opposed
to
direct
evidence.
this
is
why
in
our
reply
brief,
we
gave
an
example
of
where
the
identical
type
behavior
arose,
not
in
texas
but
in
alabama,
and
in
fact
the
individual
pleaded
guilty
to
bulk
cash
smuggling.
so
i
suppose
my
response
would
be
this.
the
same
weak
inferences
that
supported
the
money
laundering
conviction
in
the
government's
eyes
would
be
the
same
inferences
that
would
support
the
cash
smuggling.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
i
don't
think--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--but
i
don't
think
it
is
the
same,
your
honor,
because
the
cash
smuggling,
the
bulk
cash
smuggling
statute,
speaks
to
currency
and
of
course
this
speaks
to
transactions.
so
i
think
that
there
is
in
fact--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--well,
i'm
distinguishing
between
currency
and
transaction
because
as
i
understand
it
at
least
transaction
might
implicate
in
a
banking
context,
but
cash
is
cash,
if
you
will.
so--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
police
are
aware
of
it
and
then
the
flush,
if
you
will,
takes
the
money
across,
i
think
that's...
that's
much
closer.
that's--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i
would...
no,
i
think
that
the...
if
the
police
were
aware,
if
the
police
were
aware
and
the
kingpin
were
aware
and
put
in
place
some
type
of
design,
if
you
will,
to
flush
the
money
and
perhaps
to...
to
mexico
under
the
circumstances
you
described,
then
you
would
be
closer
to,
to
having
money
laundering
liability,
although
certainly
i
don't
know
that
the
courier
necessarily
would.
however,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
consider
that
the
money
laundering
statute
necessarily
contemplates
this
notion
of...
of
detection
or
the
money
resurfacing,
if
you
will.
and
the
reason
i
think
that's
important
is
because
it
gives
a
particular
meaning
to
those
listed
attributes.
if
the
police
were
just...
well,
in
this
case,
just
stumbled
upon
it,
and
nothing
was...
had
been
done
and
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
record
to
suggest
that
there
was
going
to
be
anything
done
in
this
case
other
than
repayment,
money
laundering
liability
is
simply
not
going
to
arise.
now,
i
think
that--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i
think
that--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i
think
what's
wrong,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
the
statute
focuses
on
the
transportation
or
some
of
the
other
transfers
of
transmission
and
specifically
is
coupled,
if
you
will,
with
this
notion
of...
of
the
attributes
themselves.
i
don't
know
that
it's...
it's
simply
too
broad,
in
fact,
to
say
that
all
transportation's
will
necessarily
incur
the
money
laundering
liability.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
that...
you're
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
i
think,
a
point
to
be
made.
the...
judge
smith
below
did
try
to
highlight
the
fact
that
if
you
transport
to
conceal,
then
you're
beginning
to
implicate
money
laundering
liability.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
and
the
reason
i
don't
is
because
that...
what
you've
described
implicates
potential
money
spending,
this
notion
that
the
money
is
easier
spent.
but
without
more,
money
spending
would
not
equate
to
money
laundering.
that's--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i'm
not
sure,
justice,
that
you've
actually
concealed
the
nature.
if
the
money
was
going...
if
the
money
was
dirty
and
going
across
dirty,
it
remained
dirty
and
just
happened
to
be
spent.
but--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--again,
i
don't
know
that
there
has
been...
as
i
understood
the
hypothetical,
i
don't
think
that
there's
been
any
suggestion
of
a
design
to
conceal,
the
why.
you're
just
taking
dirty
and
you're--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i...
justice
souter,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
is
here.
the
statute
is
designed
to
take...
or
purposed
to
take
these
dirty
proceeds,
unlawful
proceeds,
and
to
cleanse
them
so
as
to
prevent
their
injection
into
streams
of
legitimate
commerce.
what
you've
described
as
spending
is
admittedly
spending,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
spending
that's...
that
you've
contemplated
there
basically
implicates
the
core
concern,
if
you
will.
the
money--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--justice
scalia,
what
we
know,
because
the
government's
evidence
established
it,
is
that
the
money
was
being
sent
back
to
mexico
to
repay--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--well,
i
would
hazard
to
say
no,
of
course,
but
the
record--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--there
was.
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
i'm
sorry?
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
the
evidence
that
you
just
asked
about
went
to
that
it
was
easier
to
spend
money
in
mexico.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
yes,
yes.
and
it...
and--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--what
i
take
it
to
mean--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--certainly
more
than
here.
that
was
what
i
think
that
the
evidence
was
offered
for.
and
the
same
expert,
of
course
offered,
you
know,
established...
or
the
government
established
through
the
same
expert
that
the
purpose
of
this
particular
transportation
was
to
complete
the
transaction,
the
drug
transaction.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
and,
of
course,
we
are
well
aware
that
those
words
are
not
found
in
the
statute,
nor
do
we
suggest
that
they
were.
but
what
we
have
suggested
is
simply
that
that's,
if
you
will,
shorthand
for
describing
what
necessarily
occurs
if
the
attributes,
the
listed
attributes,
are
obfuscated.
that
is
the
cleansing
mechanism.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
well,
at
that
point,
yes,
because
i
think--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--well,
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
who
has
been
taped
is
contemplating
the
money's
resurfacing,
i
think
that
there
would
be.
it
would
be
not
legitimate
wealth,
though.
and
perhaps
i
need
to
drive
this
point
home.
it
would
be
less
dirty.
in
other
words,
there's
not
a
requirement
that
the
dirty
money
necessarily
be
made
clean
or
a
description,
but
that
the
dirty
money
be
made
less
dirty.
and
that
i
think
is...
is
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
if
we...
well,
justice
scalia,
if
we--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--right.
if
we
assume
that
the...
that
the
latter,
as
you
just
said,
satisfies
the
statute,
then
you
have
a
conviction.
but
we
certainly
don't
assume
that,
because
that
implicates
money
spending,
and
money
spending
hasn't...
hasn't
been
held
to
be
money
laundering.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
well,
certainly
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
any
evidence
that
mr.
cuellar
knew
any
such
thing.
if
you
were
to
remove
it
from
the
confines
of
the
cuellar
case,
i
think
you...
your
hypothetical
does
come
closer
to
implicating
liability;
but
that's
simply
not
what
we
have
here,
at
least.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
justice
stevens.
it
would
again,
i
think,
require
more.
if
all
that
were
required
is
to
show
that
there
was
unlawful
proceeds--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--well,
what
i
think
it
means
is
that
there
has
to
be
some...
the
transportation
or
what
have
you
has
to
be
purposed,
designed,
to
take
the
nature
and
obfuscate
it.
and
this--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--that
it
would...
i
think
that
it
would...
"nature"
is
perhaps
the
first
and
foremost
of
the
attributes,
but
i
think
that
it
means,
that
it
means
dirty,
unclean.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
oh,
okay.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
when
i
have...
when
i
read
the
attributes
and
contemplate--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--right.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
i
have
thought
of
it
as
meaning
basically
dirty.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
proceeds
of
unlawful
activity
are
the--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--there
may
be...
well,
yes,
i
see
where
you're
going.
is
there...
what
is
the
independent
meaning
of
"nature".
i
think
that--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--i
don't...
i
brook
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
mean,
yes.
i'm
just...
what
i
was
simply
suggesting--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--that's
true,
and
the
meaning
certainly
of
"conceal"
would
be
to
bring
it
forward
with
maybe
no
explanation
of
the
taint,
if
you
will.
and,
of
course,
"disguise"
would
be
to
maybe
create
a
false
explanation
of
where
the
money
is--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--to
avoid
a
transaction
reporting--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--your
honor,
as
i
understand
it
he
would
have
a
currency
reporting
requirement,
had
he
been
going
south.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
a
currency
reporting
requirement,
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
transaction
reporting
requirement.
i
think
that
that--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--may
implicate
different
considerations.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand.
and
so
where
we
are
left
is
he
may
not
be
guilty
under
money
laundering
and
perhaps,
perhaps
not
under
bulk
cash
smuggling.
but
that
in
itself
does
not
necessitate
a
broadly
interpreted
understanding
of
the
money
laundering
statute.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
that's
a
possibility,
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no,
and
i
think
that...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
understand,
for
example,
that
hiding
money
is
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
as...
i
mean,
concealing
money
is
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
as
concealing
the
location.
and
i
think
you
could
make
the
same
type
of
analysis
in
the
other--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--yes.
but,
again,
i
think
that
the
term
"location",
which
is
understood
in
the
context
of
the
words
surrounding
it,
if
i
take
money
and
hide
it
in
my--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--what
i'm
suggesting,
chief
justice,
is
that
if
the...
that
the
statute
would
have
a
particularly
different
meaning
from
the
one
that
the
government
wants
if
the
attributes
just
listed
existence
of
the
money.
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
hiding
money
or
hiding
the
location
of
the
money.
if
you
just
had
location
by
itself,
i'd
be
making
the
same
argument;
but
there's
a
huge
difference
between
hiding
money
or
hiding
the
location.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
all
right,
then.
if
i--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--if
i...
no.
i
think
that
the...
hiding
the
location
suggests
that
the
individual
is
contemplating
the
money
resurfacing
later,
either
for
injection
into
commerce
or
for...
perhaps
if
the
police
discover
it,
and
they're
trying...
the
launderer,
if
you
will,
is
trying
to
make
sure
that
the
money
would
survive
that
subsequent--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--yes.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
no.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you
just
hide
the
money,
that
would
encompass
just
hiding
money,
for
example,
in
the
back
yard
of
your
house
with...
with...
or
in
a
tin
can
or
under
a
mattress
or
whatever.
it's
a
much
broader...
broader
concept.
and
i
think
that
that's
really
what
is
at
play
here
because,
to
the
extent
that
the
government
is
focusing
on
the
method
or...
of
the
concealment
here,
they're...
they're
implicating
that
type
of
behavior,
if
you
will,
and
saying
it's
sufficient
to
support
a
money
laundering
conviction.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
at
this
point,
no,
justice,
because
you
haven't
suggested
that
there
was
any
type
of
design,
any
intent
to
disguise
or
conceal.
you've
just
suggested
it
went
to
another
place.
if
i
sent
it
to
an
account--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--no.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
on
those
facts,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
now,
if
i
were
sending
money
to
accounts
in
the
jurisdiction
you've
described,
and
perhaps
with
a
little
bit
more,
different
names
on
the
accounts
or
what
have
you,
then
i...
then
i
think
a
different
result.
but
if
i'm
just
sending
from
my
account
here
to
my
account
there,
then
no.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
i
would
make
the
same...
my
answer
would
be
the
same
without
more,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
it
very
well
may.
at
least...
i
don't
know
that
it
changes
everything,
but
it
very
well
may
lead
to
a
different
result.
but
you
just
modified
the
hypothetical.
what
i'm...
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
if
you're
just
putting
money
in
a
safety
deposit
box
or
this
account
or
under
the
mattress
or
in
the
hole
in
the
back
yard--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--justice,
no,
i
don't
think
so,
and
i'll
briefly
answer
and
try
to
come
back
to
you
in
rebuttal.
but
i
think
that
it's
important
to
understand
the
money
laundering
statute
is
not
a
detection
statute.
that's
not
where
the
focus
of
the
statute
rests.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
justice
scalia,
when
i
left
we
were
discussing--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--happily
i've
been
thinking
about
it.
disruption
versus
detection
i
had
told
you,
told
the
court
that
this
was
not
a
detection
statute
as
much
as
it
is
a
disruption
statute.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
recall
that
the
very
broad
interpretations
that
the
government
advances
today
are
essentially
the
very
broad
interpretations
that
the
congress
rejected
explicitly
20
years
ago.
the
congress
rejected
the
notion
that
the
transportation
of
illicit
funds
in
and
of
itself
created
money
laundering
liability.
and
we've
discussed
that.
i
think
it's
important,
justice
scalia,
in
particular,
in
response
to
your
question
to
bring
this
up,
because
the
congress
recognized
that
detection
would
be
harder
in
rejecting
that
type
of
legislation,
but
rejected
that
they
did.
the
congress
has
also
shown
itself
capable
of...
of...
in
the
1957
context
of
taking
transactions
involving
unlawful
proceeds
and
making
those
per
se
illegal.
they
could
have
easily
done
the
same
thing
in
the
transportation
context
if
they
had
wanted
to,
but
instead
they
were
looking
at
the
separate
behavior
that
comprises
money
laundering.
i
mean,
it
is
the
notion
that
you're
taking
money
somewhere
else
and
you're
doing
something
else
and
it
gives
rise
to
separate
liability.
i
think
the
true
harm
in
the
government's
interpretation,
it
basically
conflates
liability
for
money
laundering
with
the
underlying
offense,
because
all
of
the
underlying
offenses
involve
concealment.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
it
is
not
an
element,
justice
stevens.
as
i
said,
so--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--we
have
spoken
in
the
question
presented
in
that
broad
term,
because
we
think
that
that
language
encapsulates
what's
taking
place.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
it's
not
an
element.
but
what
is
an
essential
element
is
the
need
for
the
transportation...
the
transportation
to
be
designed
to
accomplish
the
same
thing,
to
obfuscate
those
attributes.
it's...
and
that's...
and
therein
is
the
reason
why--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--the
congress
had
identified,
justice
alito,
those
particular
attributes
as
being
key
to
allowing
the
launderer
to
inject
the
money
back
into
commerce.
it
may
be
that
nature
is
implicated
more
often,
but
the
congress
chose
to
list
the
others
because
they
felt
that
those
were
the
particular
attributes
that,
broadly
speaking,
allowed
for
the
laundering
process.
this
notion
of--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--for
liability
under
the
statute,
justice?
no,
because
the
purpose
there
was
not
to
obscure
the
attributes.
it
is
simply
repayment.
it's
the
final
leg,
if
you
will--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--yes.
i'm
saying
that...
i
may
have
misunderstood.
if
you
are
saying
mr.
cuellar
were
to
know
he
was
paying
the
drug
dealer?
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
that
wouldn't
give
rise
to
laundering,
because
all
you
have
there
basically
is
money
spending.
it's
the
conduct
of
the
underlying--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
you
would
have
under
these
circumstances
is
merely
the
final
step,
if
you
will,
in
the
underlying
unlawful
activity.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
i'm
not
comfortable
doing
that.
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
well,
justice,
i'm
not
uncomfortable
with
the
notion
of
him
walking,
because
i'm
not
uncomfortable
with
the
notion
you
brought
up
earlier
with
that
there
may
indeed
be
a
gap.
if
there
is
a
gap,
then
there's
a
remedy
for
that.
but
i
think
that
if--
mr.
jerry
v.
beard
--justice,
i
know
that
the...
initially
the
way
this
went
down
was
the
money
that
was
in
his
pocket.
that's
what
triggered
the...
that's
what
they
said
smelled
like
raw
marijuana.
and
then
eventually,
they
found
the
drug
money.
and
i
can't
tell
you
why
they
did
it
this
way.
but
i
think
that
your
question
underscores
they
were
concerned
not
with
obfuscating
any
attributes,
obviously,
they
were
concerned
with
getting
this
money
back
to
repay
the
person
who
had
sent
the
drugs
north
under
the
government's
theory.
