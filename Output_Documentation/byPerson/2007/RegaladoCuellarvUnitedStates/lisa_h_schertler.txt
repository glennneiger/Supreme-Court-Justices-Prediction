mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
international
concealment
money
laundering
statute
contains
no
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
requirement,
nor
does
it
demand
proof
that
the
illegal
proceeds
will
be
cleansed
after
they
cross
the
united
states
border.
petitioner's
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
supported
by
its
tests
and
would
defeat
its
purpose.
what
the
statute
does
require
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
knows
that
he
has
illegal
proceeds
and
that
he
knows
that
the
transportation
across
the
border
of
those
known
illegal
proceeds
is
designed
in
whole
or
in
part
to
conceal
or
disguise
one,
at
least
one,
of
the
facts
in
the
statute
about
those
proceeds.
the
phrase
"designed
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
directs
a
full
examination
of
the
plan,
of
the
way
in
which
the
cross
border
transportation
of
these
known
illegal
proceeds
was
planned
out.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
word
"transportation"
itself
means
the
carrying
of
something
from
one
place
to
another.
the
phrase
"designed
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
suggests
that
one
should
look
at
the
entire
plan,
the
way
that
this
transportation
was
conceived
or
planned
out
in
the
mind,
which
would
include,
we
would
submit,
the
method
that
was...
that
was
chosen
to
be
used
for
this
transportation,
the
individual
who
was
designated
to
conduct
this
transportation
of
known
illegal
proceeds
across
the
united
states
border,
and,
yes,
reasons
for
conducting
that
transportation
as
well.
but
it
is
not
limited,
as
petitioner
would
suggest,
to
just
one
fact,
that
being
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
funds
after
the
transportation
is
over.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
your
honor,
several
responses
to
that,
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
what's
the
purpose...
if
we
want
to
look
beyond
the
words
"designed
in
whole
or
in
part.
"
in
the
context
of
the
international
money
laundering
statute
to
try
to
discern
what
the
purpose
was
of
the
statute,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
prevent
criminals
from
taking
their
proceeds
abroad
where
they
would
be
outside
the
reach
of
all
of
these
controls
that
have
been
set
up
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
detect
illegal
proceeds
and
use
those
proceeds
to
trace
back
to
the
crimes
and
the
criminals
that
generated
them.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
that
would
have...
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
for
which
this
statute
was
enacted.
the...
the
premise
of
this
statute
was
that
once
illegal
proceeds
are
taken
abroad,
taken
outside
of
the
united
states
system,
we
lose
control
of
them,
we
lose
the
ability
to
find
them,
and
we
will
have
no
idea--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--and
there...
there
could
have
been
drafted
a
statute
that
was
even
broader
than
this
one
in
that
respect.
but
the
way...
the
reason
that
congress
imposed
the
"to
or
through"
requirement
is
that
it
knew...
is
that
that
was
when
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states
would
lose
the
ability
to
use
ordinary
investigative
methods
to
find
the
proceeds
of
illegal
fraud.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--yes.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
let's
say
you
have
a
drug
dealer
who
conducts
a
number
of
drug
transactions
on
one
side
of
the
border,
takes
his
daily
take,
puts
it
in
his
pocket
or
his
wallet
and
crosses
the
border
into
mexico.
based
on
that
evidence
alone,
the
government
would
not
be
able
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
merely
taking
those
illegal
proceeds,
known
illegal
proceeds,
putting
them
in
your
pocket,
that
that
was
designed
to
conceal
the
location,
that
there
was
a
plan--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--that
would--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--that
would...
yes.
your
honor,
that
would
permit
the
inference.
now,
of
course,
ultimately--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that
alone
is...
is
enough,
your
honor.
what
the
statute
asks
is
can
you
find--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--that
would...
that
would...
that
would
get
close.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
with
that
additional
evidence,
absolutely.
i
think
there
would
be
a
basis
for
a
jury
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
that
was
designed,
that
that
was
designed
to
conceal.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
we
don't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
as
i
said--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--you
need
to
find--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--no,
not
at
all.
i
mean,
what...
congress
could
have
said
every
cross
border
transportation
of
illegal
proceeds
is
covered.
and
they
did
not.
what
they
did
was
they
set
up
this
filter
for
the
ones--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--i
don't...
you
have...
they
have
to
find
a
design
to
conceal.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
no--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--your
honor,
the
title
of
this
statute,
1986.
it
saw
money
laundering
as
the
variety
of
ways
in
which
criminals
prevent
the
detection
of
their
illegal
proceeds
and
thus
are
able
to
profit
from
their
crimes.
it
covered
a
wide
range
of
conduct
that
included
converting,
yes,
illegitimate
wealth
into
legitimate
forms
through
very
complex
means.
but
congress
was
also
concerned
about
criminals
taking
their
proceeds
across
the
border
surreptitiously--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--he
needs
to
know
that
part
of
the
design,
part
of
the
plan
of
that
transportation,
was
to
conceal
or
disguise--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--and
the
use
of
that
courier
also
was
part
of
a
design
to
conceal
or
disguise
the
ownership
and
control--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--justice
ginsburg,
the...
congress's
purpose
here
was
in
getting
at
exactly
this
kind
of
conduct
by
third
parties
in
particular,
because
when
you
use
a
third
party
that
violates
another
purpose
at
which
the
statute
is
directed:
using
third
parties
to
conceal
who
the
true
owner
in
control
of
the
proceeds
is.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
it--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--yes,
justice
souter,
that
would
be
another
example
of
using
a
third
party
so
that
a...
so
that
one
part
of
the
design
of
that
transportation
is
to
conceal
the
ownership
and
control
of
the
proceeds.
and
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
congress
also...
well,
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
system
now,
the
guidelines
takes
account
of
whether
you
have
the
individual
who
is
also
engaged
in
the
underlying
offense
or
whether
you
have
a
third
party
who
had
not
been
involved
in
the
underlying
offense.
but
no...
no
matter
how
you
see
it,
this
was
precisely
the
conduct
that
congress
is
getting
at.
it
saw
that
the
only
way
to...
to
get
at
crime...
one
way
that
was
very
important
to
it
was
to
get
at
the
money
and
in
order
to
get
at
the
money
you
need
to
be
able
to
counteract
the
ways
in
which
the
criminals
would
prevent
law
enforcement
from
getting
at
the
money.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
if
he
had
designed
this
transportation,
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
whole...
the
design
of
this
transportation
was
to
conceal
or
disguise
all
five
of
the
attributes
of
these
illegal
proceeds.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--it...
it
is...
what
was...
what
was
the
plan?
what
was
the
conception?
what
decisions
were
made
about
why
and
how
we
get
these
proceeds
from
point
a
to
point
b.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
but
by--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--and
he's
arranged
it
in
a
way,
if
we're
assuming
the
transportation
here,
so
that
his
ownership
and
control
of
those
proceeds
will
be
disguised--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--during
the
course
of
the
transportation
by
saying,
i'm
going
to
select
a
third
party.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
that...
the
sentence,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
just
read
is
the
last
in
a
series
of
"if's"
that
we
lay
out
in
our
brief,
where
we...
where
we
assert
that
at
any
point
in
the
transportation
a
jury
could
find
evidence
of
a
design
to
conceal
or
disguise.
and
that
last
sentence
says
if
they
haven't
found
any
evidence
concerning
the
means
and
the
method
and
the
person
used
for
the
act
of
cross
border
transportation,
and
if
in
addition
there
was
no
evidence
of
what
would
occur
at
the
point
of
destination,
then
there
would
be
no
evidence.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
well,
that
would--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--if
we're
talking
about
just
the
attribute
of
location,
use
of
a
suitcase
i
would
say
provides
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
design
to
conceal
the
location
of
those
illegal
proceeds
during...
as
part
of
this
cross
border
transportation.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
think
it
would
provide
basis
for
a
jury
to
make--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--and
if
the
jury
were
presented
with
testimony
that
that
was
the
design...
that
the
only
design,
the
only
purpose,
the
only
plan
in
using
that
suitcase
was
to
use
it
to
secure
money
for
travel,
then
we
would
not
have
met
our
burden,
but
based
solely
on
the
circumstances.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
oh,
our...
let
me...
let
me
be
clear.
i
think
even
if
one
were
to
hypothesize
that
there
would
be
no
effort
whatsoever
to
conceal
the
money
at
the
point
of
destination,
but
a
jury
could
find
that
the
transportation
itself
was
designed
in
other
respects...
in
its
method,
in
its
means...
to
conceal
or
disguise
an
attribute
of
the
proceeds,
that
would
be
enough
to
find
that
it
was
designed
in
whole
or
in
part,
in
any
part--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--concealment...
yes.
the
only
exception
that
we
make
would
be
in
the
chief
justice's
example,
if
the
jury
were
to
find
that
there
was
no
design
to
conceal
the
location,
for
instance,
to
prevent
its
discovery;
it
was
only...
my
only
design
was
to
secure
this
for
transport,
like
i
put
my
money
in
my
wallet
to
do
that.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
question
presented--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--your
honor,
we
disagree
that
there
is
any...
there
is
no
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
requirement
in
the
statute.
this--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--this
statute--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--the
term
"laundering"
under...
when
it
is
understood
to
mean
the
way
congress
meant
it
and
the
way
congress
was
viewing
this
conduct
is
much
broader
than
petitioner
suggests.
laundering
is
the
many
ways
in
which
criminals
prevent
detection
of
their
proceeds.
it
would
include
and
congress
certainly
had
evidence
before
it--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--the
title
of
the
statute
says...
but
the
terms
of
the
statute
are
what
matter
here.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
terms
are
plain.
but
even
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
term
"laundering",
it
would
not
support
petitioner's
argument
that
that
has
a
narrow
meaning
that
includes
only
conduct
that
creates
an
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
if
the
method
of
transportation
were
exactly
the
same,
it
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
this...
this
transportation
method
was
designed,
a
jury
could
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
to
conceal
or
disguise
the
ownership
and
control
of
the
proceeds
through
the
third
party,
and
if
that
were
the
case
and
they
were
going
to
mexico
it
would
be
the
same.
the
nature
and
the
location
of
the
proceeds
through
the
use
of
this
secret
compartment
and
the
goat
hair
to
discuss
the
scent
of
the
proceeds
from
the
drug
detection
dog.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
think
that's
enough
to
get
to
the
jury,
and
that
would
be
a
jury
question,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
yes,
your
honor.
it's...
that
is
enough.
concealing
to
transport
when
the
jury...
when
it
is
part
of
the
design
of
the
transportation
to
conceal
the
location,
nature,
source,
ownership,
or
control,
any
single
one
of
those
things.
and
all
of
those
are
in
here.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
that
need
not
make
a
difference
if
there
is
evidence
before
the
jury,
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
ultimate
design
of
the
transportation
is
to
conceal
or
disguise
the
proceeds
at
the
point
of
destination.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
in
that
situation,
there
would
no
basis
to
find
concealment
or
disguise
of
location.
now,
some
of
the
other
attributes
may
be
at
issue
if
a
third
party
is
conducting
that
transportation,
but
location
from
the
method
alone.
so
the
jury
would
need
information
about,
well,
what
is
the
design,
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
cross
border
transportation?
they
could
still
find
that
the
necessary
design
to
conceal
or
disguise
is
satisfied
by
evidence
that
the
whole
purpose
here
is
to
get
it
to
mexico
where
it
will
be
turned
into
legitimate
wealth,
for
instance.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
that's...
and
i,
for
one--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--it
covers
both,
your
honor.
it
asks
broadly
what
was
this...
how
was
this
transportation
designed
and
planned
out
in
whole
or
in
part?
in
any
part,
was
it
designed
to
conceal
or
disguise?
and
that
would
encompass
all
of
the
stages
that
we
are...
that
we
are
discussing.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
bulk
cash...
well,
the
bulk...
in
this
case,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
a
bulk
cash
smuggling
statute
charge
would
have
been
viable
because
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
this
defendant
knew
of
a
currency
reporting
requirement
and
intended
to
evade
it.
petitioner's
argument
that
the
bulk
cash
smuggling
statute
shows
that
the
conduct
here
was
not
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
money
laundering
statute
is
incorrect
for
the
very
reason
that
justice
kennedy
has
identified.
the
bulk
cash
smuggling
statute
could
not
have
filled
a
gap
in
the
money
laundering
statute
for
the
conduct
here
because
it
has
always
contained
a
provision
that
covers
the
transportation
of
known
illegal
proceeds
across
the
border
to
evade
a...
reporting
requirements.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
the
plain
reading
of
the
money
laundering
statute
covers
this
conduct,
and
congress
specifically
had
this
conduct
in
mind.
as
senator
biden
said
in
questioning...
and
he
became
one
of
the
co
sponsors...
questioning
a
witness
about
this:
isn't
it
the
truth
that
if
we...
if
we
strengthen
all
our
domestic
controls
against
money
laundering,
aren't
the
criminals
going
to
resort
to
physically
transporting
their
cash
out
of
the
united
states?
this
is
a--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
this
is
part
of
the
core
conduct
at
which
this
statute
was
directed,
this
international
concealment
money
laundering
statute.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
and--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--they
will
resort
to
taking
their
money
physically
out
of
the
united
states.
and
the
senate
report
says
that
this
provision
was
designed
to
halt
this
flow.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
if
the
premise--
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
--this
provision
was
directed
at
preventing
the
illegal
moneys
from
leaving
the
country.
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
congress,
having
understood
that
when
money
leaves
the
united
states
we
have
little
if
any
ability
to
know
what
happens
to
it,
to
require
in
the
statute
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
what
would
happen
to
the

but
to
take
petitioner's
position
that
it
would
be
necessary
evidence
in
every
case
in
which
to
prevail
under
this
statute
to
know
of
future
plans
to
launder
abroad,
when
the
premise
of
this
statute
is
that
when
the
money
leaves
the
country
we
cannot
know
what
happens
to
it,
makes
no
sense.

the
court...
the
congress
certainly
could
have
written
it
in
the
broad
way
that
you've
suggested.
it's
not
unlike
the
way
that
they
wrote
section
1957,
which
covers
broadly
all
transactions
in
illegal
money.
they
chose
to
not
cover
everything
and
to
cover
cross
border
transportation's
where
there's
evidence
of
some
intent
on
the
part
of
that
individual
to
conceal
or
disguise.
and
when
you
think
about
it,
they
had
set
up
regulatory
provisions
like
the
transaction
reporting
requirement
when
there's
no
conceal
or
disguise.
there
were
other
controls
in
place
as,
say,
the
first
line
of
defense
against
money
laundering
to
say,
$10,000
or
more
is
leaving
the
country,
we're
going
to
know
about
it
because
we
have
reporting
requirements.
here
the
senate
report
says
that
they
made
the
decision
to
require
evidence
of
concealment.
"evidence
of
concealment
of
a
crime.
"
is
what
the
report
says.
and
any
time
one
of
these
attributes
of
illegal
proceeds
is
being
concealed
or
disguised,
that
is
concealing
a
crime
in
a
way
that
impairs
law
enforcement
from
finding
those
proceeds.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
would...
i
would
go
back
to
the
evidence
that
justice
alito
has
pointed
out
that
is
in
this
record,
that
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that...
that
the...
by
taking
the
funds
to
mexico,
they
would
be
able
to
be
used
in
a
way
that
would
not
raise
suspicion.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
there
was...
i
would
not...
i
would
not
disagree
with
that.
i
think
that
we
do...
i
see
that
my
red
light
is
on.
ms.
lisa
h.
schertler
your
honor,
there
was...
there
was
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
proceeds
were
removed...
this
is
expert
testimony...
removed
from
the
united
states
to
conceal
so
as
not
to
go
through
reporting
requirements,
so
that
the
money
would
not
be
identified
to
u.s.
law
enforcement.
we
believe
the
jury
could
also
infer
that
further
efforts
to
conceal
and
disguise
those
proceeds
would
occur
at
the
point
of
destination.
thank
you,
your
honor.
