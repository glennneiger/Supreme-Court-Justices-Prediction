chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-1456,
cuellar
versus
united
states.
mr.
beard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
he
certainly
concealed
the
location.
they
were
secreted
in
the
car,
under
the
goat
hair
and
everything
else.
the
location
of
the
money
was
certainly
concealed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
why...
why
isn't
this
transporting
to
conceal
the
location
or
the
ownership
in
this
sense?
suppose
you
have
someone
the
police
suspect
of
engaging
in
drug
activities.
they
know
he
sold,
you
know,
so
much
marijuana
or
whatever
and
got
cash
back.
they
think
it's
there,
and
they're
going
to
investigate
it,
but
this
fellow
comes
in
and
they
transport
the
proceeds
across
the
border.
isn't
that
transportation
to
conceal
the
location
or
the
ownership?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
think
it's
there,
but
they're
not
sure,
and
they...
you
know,
that
would
help
them
make
their
case,
to
find
out
that
the
guy
they
think
sold
the
drugs
has
$80,000.
so
they
get
a
search
warrant
or
whatever,
and
it
turns
out
he
doesn't,
because
it's
been
transported
to
conceal
the
location
or
ownership.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
can
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
justice
stevens's
line
of
questioning?
if...
do
you
conceal
the
nature
of
proceeds
if
you
conceal
the
proceeds?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that...
that
doesn't
seem
to
follow.
i
understand
the
argument
with
"nature".
in
other
words,
you're
not
concealing
the
nature;
it's
just
not
there.
but
when
you're
hiding
it,
you
are
concealing
the
location.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
gets
me
to
a
question.
several
times
you've
referenced
the
attributes.
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
would
have
a
different
meaning
if
it
just
said
"location"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
better
explain
that
a
little
more
for
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
they
seem
to
me
the
same.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
so
hiding
location
assumes
it's
going
to
come
up
later.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
you
just
hide
the
money,
you
assume
he's
just
going
to
leave
it
somewhere
and
forget
about
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
"more"
is
they
don't
hold
it
under
your
name.
they
hold
it
under
a
numerical
account
number.
then
that
changes
everything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
beard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
schertler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
that
enough?
if,
for
example,
he's
being...
he
thinks
he's
being
watched
by
law
enforcement
because
they
know
he's
up
to
something,
but
his
brother
isn't,
why
isn't
that
concealing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
during
the
course
of
the
transportation.
that
is
not
what
you
say
in
your
brief.
i'm
looking
at
page
41
and
what
you
say
is:
"if
no
independent
evidence
establishes
that
concealment
or
disguising
of
the
pertinent
attribute
of
the
proceeds
would
occur
at
the
point
of
destination,
then
a
factfinder
would
lack
a
reasonable
basis
for
inferring
that
the
transportation
was
designed
to
conceal
or
disguise.
"
in
other
words,
in
the
hypothetical
justice
scalia
just
gave...
in
other
words
everybody
knows
he's
a
drug
dealer,
he
spends
the
money...
there
is
no
concealment
or
disguising
the
pertinent
attribute
at
the
point
of
destination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
there
is
no
money
laundering
if
they
conceal
the
proceeds
in
a
suitcase
that's
in
the
trunk
of
the
car?
is
that
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
concealing
the
money?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
use
of
a
suitcase
provide
that
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
i
use
a
suitcase
i'm
using
it
to
carry
my
clothes,
not
to
conceal
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
this
fellow
were
driving
to
canada
would
that
be
a
different
case,
because
canada
does
not
have
the
sort
of
cash
economy
we've
heard
about
in
mexico?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
what
if
the
fellow
says:
you
know,
there
are
dangerous
roads
between
here
and
mexico.
i'm
hiding
the
money
so
that
if,
you
know,
a
gang
comes
up
they
don't
find
it.
and
you
say:
no,
we
think
you're
hiding
it
because
it's
illegal
proceeds?
is
that
enough
to
get
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many
co
sponsors
were
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
finish
your
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
schertler.
mr.
beard,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
beard.
the
case
is
submitted.
