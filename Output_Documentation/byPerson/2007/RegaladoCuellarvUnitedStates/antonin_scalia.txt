justice
antonin
scalia
i...
maybe
i
don't
understand
the...
i
thought
he
was
helping
you,
but
maybe...--
[laughter]
were
you
helping
him?
i
thought
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
any
evidence
like
that
here
anyway,
do
we?
do
we
know
that
this
was
going
to
"spendy
land"
where
everybody
has
a
lot
of
money?
did
we
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
everybody
have
a
lot
of
money
in
mexico?
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
the
statutory
purpose
have
to
be
the
only
purpose
or
the
principal
purpose?
i
mean,
i
could
conceive
that
the
principal
purpose
of
this
transportation
was
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
fellow
who
gave
the
drugs,
to
pay
the
provider
of
the
drugs.
i
assume
that
would
be
the
principal
purpose.
but
what
if
you
know
that
when
the...
when
the
provider
of
the
drugs
is
paid,
he'll
be
able
to
spend
this
cash
easily
in
mexico,
which
has
a
cash
economy?
and
let's
assume
that
the
latter
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
purpose
requirement
of
this
statute.
what...
what
would
be
the
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
assume
a
primary
purpose
to
pay
off
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
though
that
wasn't
the
real
purpose...
i
mean,
the
real
purpose
was
to
pay
off
this
fellow,
who
otherwise
might
come
to
hurt
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
once
you
do
pay
him
off,
you
know
that
the
money
is
going
to
be
ready
spendable.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
police
can't
find
it
in
that
account
even
if
it
is
still
under
your
name.
in
an
account
here
the
police
would
be
able
to
find
it.
in
an
account
in
the
cayman
islands,
they
won't
be
able
to.
isn't
that...
isn't
that
transporting
it
in
order
to
conceal,
to
conceal
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that,
so
i
hope
you
will
explain
it
later.
it
doesn't
mean
anything
if
it's
not
a
detection
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
puts
it
in
his
shoe,
okay.
because
it's
a
lot,
he
puts
it
in
his
shoe.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
enough,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
basically
confronting
face
on
the
dissent
here,
which
drew
a
distinction
between
transporting
to
conceal
and
concealing
to
transport.
and
all
you
have
here
is
concealing
to
transport,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
violates
the
statute.
i
agree
with
justice
breyer
that
if
this
is
a
statute
directed
at
concealing
to
transport,
it's
a
funny
name
for
it
to
think
that
it's
a
money
laundering
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
everybody
knows
he's
a
drug
dealer,
back
in
juarez
or
wherever
he
lives
in
mexico.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
famous
in
town.
he's
a
well
respected
man
because
he's
a
big
drug
dealer.
and
he
has
just
arranged
get
the
money
delivered
to
him
so
that
he
can
spend
it.
what...
what's
concealing
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
won't
be
disguised.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
to
be
clear,
you
affirmatively
say
that
concealing
to
transport
is
enough,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
principle
that
all
criminal
statutes
have
to
cover
every...
every
bad
act.
maybe
congress
has
left
a
gap.
i'm
willing
to
entertain
the
possibility
that
this
individual,
obviously
doing
something
very
bad,
doesn't...
falls
between
the
two
stools.
he
is
neither
guilty
under
the
taking
currency
out
of
the
country
statute
because
he
didn't
know
of
the
existence
of
the
statute,
and
he's
not
guilty
under
one
because
he
was
not
transporting
to
conceal
but
was
concealing
to
transport.
and
so
there's
a
gap.
the
justice
department
can
certainly
get
that
gap
filled
readily
enough.
i
don't
know
why
we
should
torture
either
one
of
the
statutes
to
close
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
trying
to
prevent
the
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if...
if
that's
what
they're
concerned
about,
taking
the
money
out
of
the
country,
why
do
they
have
the
concealment
requirement?
they
could
have
just
said,
you
know,
if
you
take
dirty
money
out
of
the
country
you're
guilty.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
that.
they
have
a
concealment...
i
can't
understand
why,
if
the
money
is
hidden
during
the
transportation,
it's
any
worse
than
when
the
money
is
not
hidden
during
the
transportation.
it
isn't...
it
isn't
the
hiding
during
the
transportation
they're
concerned
about.
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forget
what
it
was
that
i
didn't
understand.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
beard,
can't
you
give
us
something
we
can
get
this
guy
on?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
carrying
dirty
money.
it
even
smells
of
drugs.
[laughter]
can't
we
get
him
as
an
accessory
to
drug
dealing
or
something?
you
say
he
has
to
walk?
