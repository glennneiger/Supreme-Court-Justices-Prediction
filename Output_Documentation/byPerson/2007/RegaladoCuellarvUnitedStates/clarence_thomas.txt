justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
petitioner
was
arrested
after
the
car
he
was
driving
toward
the
mexican
boarder
was
stopped
and
searched.
police
found
nearly
$81,000
in
cash
hidden
in
a
secret
compartment
in
the
vehicle
and
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
petitioner
was
involved
in
drug
trafficking
found
other
indications
that
he
had
taken
elaborate
steps
to
avoid
detection
of
the
money.
after
a
jury
trial,
petitioner
was
convicted
of
violating
the
provision
of
the
federal
money
laundering
statute
that
prohibits
the
transportation
of
illicit
funds
across
the
boarder
while
knowing
that
the
transportation
was
designed
to
conceal
or
disguise
the
nature,
location,
source,
ownership
or
control
of
the
money.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
his
conviction.
petitioner
raises
the
same
two
arguments
here
that
the
court
of
appeals
rejected.
first,
that
a
money
laundering
conviction
requires
proof
that
he
attempted
to
create
the
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
and
second,
that
the
statute
cannot
be
satisfied
by
proof
that
petitioner
merely
hid
the
funds
in
transit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
first,
although
we
agree
that
money
laundering
may
be
commonly
understood
as
making
illicit
gains
appear
legitimate,
we
must
be
guided
by
the
statutory
text
and
here
it
contains
no
such
limitation.
we
also
reject
petitioner's
argument
that
this
requirement
is
inherent
in
the
statutory
elements.
concealing
or
disguising
one
of
the
listed
attributes
would
not
necessarily
make
the
funds
appear
more
legitimate
nor
would
disclosing
one
of
the
attributes
necessarily
reveal
the
funds
as
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
that
is.
second,
we
agree
that
petitioner
--
with
petitioner
that
evidence
of
secretive
efforts
during
transportation,
even
the
elaborate
tactics
used
here
is
not
sufficient
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
petitioner
knew
that
the
transportation
itself
was
designed
to
conceal
or
disguise
the
funds,
nature,
location,
source,
ownership,
or
control.
we
read
the
design
to
conceal
or
disguise
element
to
mean
that
a
defendant
must
have
known
that
the
transportation
was
intended
to
achieve
the
effect
of
concealing
or
disguising
a
list
of
attributes
of
the
funds.
although
the
secretive
manner
in
which
petitioner
transported
the
cash
may
be
probative
of
his
knowledge
that
the
transportation
was
so
designed,
it
is
not
itself
sufficient
proof.
the
only
direct
evidence
the
government
introduced
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
transportation
was
that
it
was
designed
to
compensate
the
leaders
of
the
drug
trafficking
organization
which
plainly
says
nothing
about
a
design
to
conceal
or
disguise
a
listed
attribute.
nor
did
the
government
introduce
evidence
from
which
petitioner's
knowledge
of
a
purpose
to
conceal
or
disguise
a
listed
attribute
could
be
inferred.
on
this
evidence
the
jury
could
reasonably
have
found
all
of
the
elements
of
the
statute
satisfied
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
justice
alito
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
