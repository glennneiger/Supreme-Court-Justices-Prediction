justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask,
what
do
you
mean
by
method
of
transportation
in
this
case?
i
mean,
that
it
was
in
a
car
or
the
fact
it
was
wrapped
up
in
dirty...
in
a
dirty
kind
of
container,
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
that
all
just
evidence
that
there
was
a
motive
to
conceal
the
ownership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
you
understand
the
language
"disguise
the
nature
of
the
proceeds
of
this
specified
unlawful
activity.
"
to
mean,
does
that...
is
that
satisfied
by
merely
proof
that
it
is
proceeds
of
unlawful
activity?
or
do
you
have
to
tell
that...
what
is
the
word
"nature"
talking
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
it
seems
to
say.
what
i'm
asking
is:
what
do
you
think
it
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
asking
about
the
word...
the
meaning
of
the
word
"nature".
what
is
the
nature,
other
than
the
fact
it's
proceeds
of
unlawful
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
"dirty"
in
some
sense
other
than
being
proceeds
of
specified
unlawful
activity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
know
what
that
means
other
than
that
it
is
proceeds
of
unlawful--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
just
talking
about
the
one
attribute,
"nature".
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
you
think
that
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
proceeds
of
unlawful
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
always
dirty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
verb
is
not
"transformed".
the
verb
is
"disguise"
or
"conceal".
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
broader
question,
forgetting
the
text
of
the
statute
for
just
a
minute,
because
the
text
is
extremely
broad.
do
you
think
the
question
whether
there's
an
attempt
to
create
an
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
has
anything
to
do
with
the
analysis?
the
question
presented
is
whether
there
must
be
such
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you're
arguing
that's
totally
irrelevant
and
that...
and
also
that
that
familiar
title,
"money
laundering",
totally
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no...
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
term
"laundering"
really
should
be
totally
ignored?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
could
find
a
violation
of
it,
but
what
i'm
really
asking
you:
is
this
just
a
total
wild
goose
chase?
we
shouldn't
even
consider
laundering
at
all?
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it's
totally
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
irrelevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
may
i
ask
this
question?
if
the
statute
did
include...
and
i
know
you
think
it
does
not...
a
requirement
of
trying
to
create
an
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth,
you
would
lose?
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
also,
consistent
with
the
evidence,
they
want
to
pay
the
drug
dealer
for
the
drugs.
and
then
a
jury...
you
can't
say
it's
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
that
was
not
what
it
was
going
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
the
same
basic
question
of
you?
do
you
think
that
this
line,
"create
an
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth.
"
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
your
question
presented
raised
that
question,
you're
walking
away
from
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
an
essential
element
of
the
offense?
