justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i
should
ask
you
this
now
because
you've
probably
thought
about
it
and
i
can't
work
it
out.
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
the
word
"location".
i
thought
what
you
would
say
is
it
isn't
the
transportation
in
this
instance
that
concealed
the
location,
it's
the
method
of
transportation
that
sealed
the
location.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
read
it
that
literally,
then
there
is
no
problem
in
getting
to
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
or
is
there?
because
since
you
didn't
advance
that
argument,
i
thought
maybe
there's
something
i've
not
seen
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
don't
see
why
isn't
what
the
chief
justice
said
absolutely
right?
if
you
are
transporting
this
money
to
get
it
out
of
town
so
the
police
can't
find
it,
you're
transporting
it
to
conceal
it.
that
falls
right
within
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
transporting
it
simply
to
pay
some
courier
somewhere
else,
you're
not
transporting
it
to
conceal
it.
and
if
in
fact
the
transportation
is
done
in
a
way
that
conceals
it,
that's
beside
the
point
because
the
statute
is
interested
in
transporting
it
in
order
to
conceal
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
i
agree
with
you
that
you
could
read
this
as
including
a
prohibition
against
a
method
of
transportation
which
method
is
to
hide
the
money.
you
could.
but
you
could
also
read
it
the
way
that
the
question
suggests,
to
refer
only
to
the
transportation.
so
you
transport
it
physically
in
order
later
to
hide
it.
now,
the
difference
between
the
two
is
if
we
accept
yours,
which
is
the
broader,
this
statute
includes
everything
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
common
word
"money
laundering".
any
time
you
hide
something,
for
whatever
reason
you
hide
it,
to
take
it
to
pay
the
couriers,
you're
money
laundering.
any
time
you
run
a
gambling
operation
and
the
people
stick
the
money
in
the
wad
of
their
shoe,
they're
money
laundering.
i
mean,
why
would
you
think
congress
would
want
that
narrow
reading
when
it
can
be
read
to
focus
much
more
closely
on
money
laundering
just
by
reading
it
literally
for
what
it
says?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
purposely
puts
it
in
his
shoe,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
design.
he
knows
he's
going
to
do
it.
so...
and
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
100
percent
of
the
time
that's
illegal.
if
you're
not
saying
that,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
are
saying
that,
i
don't
know
why
they
call
this
statute
"laundering
of
monetary
instruments".
why
didn't
they
call
it
"shoe
hiding"?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
show
what
you
want
it
to
show?
i
mean,
what
i
just
heard
you
say
is
that
senator
biden
said
if
we
make
it
very
tough
to
launder
money
in
the
united
states,
then
criminals
will
send
their
money
abroad
to
be
laundered.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they'll
transport
it
abroad
in
order
to
launder
it.
how
does
that
help
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
order
to
launder
it.
were
they
not
talking
about
money
laundering?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
were
they
not
talking
about
it?
i'm
just
going
back...
i
didn't
read
senator
biden's
statement,
so
i'm
just
curious.
