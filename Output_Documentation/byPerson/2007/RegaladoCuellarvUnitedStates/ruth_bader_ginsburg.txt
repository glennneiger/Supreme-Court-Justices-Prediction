if
he
were
a
courier
bringing
the
marijuana
into
the
united
states
what
would
be
the
crime
and
the
penalty?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
was
bringing
marijuana
into
the
united
states
instead
of
returning
with
the
proceeds?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
he
possesses
money.
and
you're
not
saying
this
is
innocent
behavior.
it
is
criminal
behavior,
so
what
is
the
crime
if
not
money
laundering?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
requires
knowing
that
it's
illegal
to
take
out
more
than
x
amount
of
money,
and
there's
nothing
that
indicates
that
the
common
courier
would
know
anything
about
such
a
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
matter
for
purposes
of
the
bulk
cash
statute
that
it
was
illegal.
it
could
be
perfectly
lawful
money.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
sounds
like
he
was
making
the
distinction
that
didn't
the
dissenting
judge
make
between...
the
dissenting
judge
says
transporting
to
conceal
is
no
good,
but
concealing
to
transport
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
isn't
it
simply
to
change
the
nature
from
being
drug
money
to
look
like
it's
apparently
innocent?
i
mean
the
change
of
the
nature...
the
nature
going
in
is
it's
always
dirty.
it's
drug
money.
and
the
purpose
of
the
concealment
is
to
get
it
converted
to
some
different
nature,
i.e.,
clean
money.
isn't
that
what
"disguise
the
nature"
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
he...
if
he
didn't
know
about
the
currency
reporting
requirement,
then
he's
not
guilty
under
that
statute
because
it
requires
knowledge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he's
not...
if
he
doesn't
fit
into
either
category,
then
there's
no
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
say
the
same
thing
for...
if
you
just
put
it
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
a
bank
in
the
bahamas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
they
concerned
that
this
was
a
20-year
penalty,
not
what
you're
talking
about,
the
person
who
gets...
who
is
the
drug
dealer,
but
all
that
this
evidence
shows
is
that
we
have
a
courier.
we
don't
even
know
if
he
knows
who
put
the
money
in
the
car.
we
don't
know
if
he
knows
the...
who
the
person
is
that
he's
to
deliver
the
money
to.
so
on
your
theory,
all
you
have
to
prove
is
that
this
defendant
drove
a
car
in
which
illicit
money
was
hidden
in
order
to
get
it
out
of
the
country.
no
grand
design.
all
he
is
is
a
courier.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a...
that's
a
lot
of
fancy
language.
all
he
knows,
in
fact,
if
he's
just
a
courier
is
that
somebody
gave
him
money
to
take
this
car
in
which
drug
money
is
hidden
across
the
border.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
his
design.
his
design
is
only...
i
mean,
he's
just
a
drug
courier,
and
i
think
that's
what...
that's
a
problem
with
your
interpretation
of
the
statute.
one
can
think
of
the
kingpin
having
this
elaborate
plan,
and
when
it
gets
to
mexico
it's
going
to
go
into
this
bank
and
that
place.
but
here
the
defendant
is
simply
a
courier,
and
on
the
government's
theory
anyone
who
transports
hidden
money
to
get
it
out
of
the
country,
who
drives
the
car,
just
the
driver,
is
a
money
launderer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
do
you
make
distinctions
between
methods
of
concealment?
and
if
the
design
is
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
country,
why
should
it
matter
whether
you
put
it
in
a
travel
bag,
you
put
it
in
the
glove
compartment,
you
put
it
in
your
wallet,
or
you
go
through
this
elaborate
disguise
that
we
see
here?
what...
if
what's
important
is
getting
it
beyond
the
border
beyond
the
reach
of
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
how
carefully
it
is
concealed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
transporting
to
conceal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
this
statute
covers
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
your
brief,
you
said
the
bulk
cash
statute
would
not
apply
to
a
courier.
do
you
still
take
that
position,
that
the
government's
choice
is
to
indict
for
money
laundering
or
nothing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
point...
the
point
about
aiding
and
abetting
something,
this
money
reeks
of
marijuana,
and
that
was
very
puzzling
to
me.
why
this
is
the
standard
operating
procedure
to
take
this
money
and
wrap
it
in
containers
that
had
contained
the
drug.
so
when
the
police
find
it,
they
know
it's
drug
money.
