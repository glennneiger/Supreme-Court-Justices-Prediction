justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
take
it
that
you
concede...
i
don't
want
to
say
that
you
concede.
if
we
take
it
the
government
has
a
strong
case
under
the
smuggling
statute,
wouldn't
it
have
an
equally
strong
case
under
(i)
of
the
statute
that
we're
considering
here,
which
doesn't
require
concealing
or
disguising
the
nature,
just
to
avoid
a
transportation
reporting
requirement.
that's
the
same
as
the
smuggling
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
the
government
didn't
indict
under
(ii).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
as
the
proceeds
of
an
illegal
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
reporting
requirement
for...
for
this
shipment.
if
he
had
gone
to
the
border,
would
he...
well,
then,
a
lot
of
what
you're
arguing
about
isn't
very
important
because
they
could
just
indict
under
(ii).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
avoid
a
transaction
reporting
requirement,
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
all
this
"nature"
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
indicated
that
there
is
such
a
requirement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
what
you're
saying,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
movement
of
funds,
if
they're
illegal
proceeds,
outside
of
the
country
is
a
per
se
concealment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
give
me
an
example
of
when
you
take
money
outside
of
the
country
that's
illegal
money--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
not
a
concealment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
let
me
back
up.
then
let
me
add
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying,
as
you
have
to
say,
that
any
movement
of
illegal
funds
outside
the
country
which
is
concealed
is
per
se
concealing
a
relevant
attribute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
have
to
go
that
far
to
make
the
case
you're
making.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
always
concealing
the
control.
you're
always
concealing
the
ownership.
you're
always
concealing
the
location
if
it's
in
your
shoe
or
in
the
bottom
of
the
car.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
is
still
not
clear
to
me.
it...
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
should
be
yes,
because
he's
concealing
the
ownership
as
of
the
time
he
goes
across
the
border,
which
brings
me
to
my
earlier
question,
if
once
it's
concealed,
the
statute
is
always...
is
always
valid.
then
you
indicated
that
oh,
well,
what
happens
at
the
destination
is
very
important.
then
we
had
justice
scalia's
hypothetical.
i'm
not
sure
where
you
came
out
on
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
concealment,
concealment
during
the
transportation
is
always
a
concealment
of
an
attribute
under
the
statute.
that
has
to
be
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
your
only
defense
is
to
go
across
the
border
and
before
you
go
across
you
put
all
the
money
in
your
arms
so
the
people
can
see
it?
that's
the
way
you
do
it?
[laughter]
other
than
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you,
in
response
to
one
of
my
hypotheticals,
said
that
it
would
be
relevant
in
some
cases
to
show
that
it
was
designed
to
create
the
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth.
so
you
put
that
back
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you
put
that
back
into
play.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
evidence
is
clear
that
he
knew
he
was
taking
it
across
the
border
and
it
was
to
pay
the
drug
dealer?
would
that
suffice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
no,
no.
he
conceals
it,
in
order
to
pay
the
drug
dealer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
concealing
who
owns
and
controls.
