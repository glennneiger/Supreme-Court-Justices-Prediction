justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
someone
transports
money
across
a
border
and
is
recorded
surreptitiously
on
tape
explaining
exactly
why
the
person
did
it,
and
the
person
says:
the
reason
why
i'm
transporting
this
across
the
border
is
because
i
know
that
when
i
get
it
to
the
destination
country,
that's
a
place
where
people
use
huge
amounts
of
cash
for
bank
deposits,
for
purchases;
and,
therefore
the
act
of
transporting
it
from
the
united
states
to
the
other
country
will
disguise
the
nature
of
the
cash
as
drug
money.
would
that
fall
within
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
that
fit
the
literal
language
of
the
statute?
it's
a
transportation
across
the
board
with
the
design
to
conceal
the
nature,
i.e.,
that
it's
drug
money,
of
this
money?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
there...
was
there
evidence
about
the
nature
of
the
mexican
economy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wasn't
there
an
expert
who
said
that
mexico
has
a
cash
economy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
does
that
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
it
mean
people
can
spend
a
lot
of
cash
without
raising
eyebrows?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
your
brief,
you
argue
that
there
has
to
be
a
design
to
create
the
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth.
are
you
drawing
back
now
from
that
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
that
be
so?
suppose...
i
mean,
just
take...
modify
my
hypothetical.
what
this
person
says
on
the
tape
is:
i'm
sending
this
money
across
the
border
because
i
know
that
if
it...
once
it
gets
there,
it
will
be
harder
to
establish
my
ownership
of
it.
people
will
still
know
that
it's
drug
money
perhaps,
but
they...
it
will
be
harder
to
establish
my
ownership
of
it.
now,
would
that
fall
within
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
wouldn't
be
an
attempt
to
create
the
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
there
then,
would
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
if
there
is
a
wire
transfer
to
a
bank
in
another
country
because
that
bank
has
bank
secrecy
laws
that
will
make
it
impossible
to
ascertain
the
location
of
the
money
once
it
is
there?
does
that
fall
within
the
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
that's
the
purpose.
if
the
person
says,
i'm
sending
this
to
blank
country
because
they've
got
bank
secrecy
laws
there
that
make
it
impossible
to
find
this
money
once
it
gets
into
their
banking
system.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
word
"transportation"
mean
the
act
of
transportation
across
the
border
or
the
method
of
transportation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
person
who
set
all
this
up
lives
in
mexico
and
the
sole
intent
of
that
person
was
to
bring
the
money
back
to
him
in
the
place
where
he
lives?
that
would...
would
that
be
money
laundering
by
him,
to
start
out
with?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
a
question
of...
isn't
that
a
question
of
his
intent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
the
effect
of
the
design,
is
it?
it's
the
intent
of
the
design.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
same
thing,
appearance
of
legitimate
wealth
goes
to
one
of
the
attributes,
the
nature
of
what's
being
transported.
it
doesn't
go
to
all
the
other
attributes.
