mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
false
claims
act
addresses
and
redresses
fraud
on
the
government,
not
on
every
recipient
of
government
funds.
the
liability
imposing
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act
refer
ten
times
in
a
single
sentence
to
a
submission
to
the
government,
getting
a
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government,
or
defrauding
the
government.
liability
is
to
the
government
and
it's
based
upon
the
amount
of
damages
that
the
government
sustains.
20
years
ago,
construing
an
even
broader
statute,
this
court
unanimously
determined
that
defrauding
the
government
in
any
manner
for
any
purpose
does
not
include
defrauding
recipients
of
federal
funds.
that's
the
tanner
case.
the
united
states
made
the
same
arguments
in
the
tanner
case
in
1987
that
it's
making
today
in
connection
with
the
false
claims
act,
and
this
court
unanimously
decided
that
case
that
defrauding
the
government
did
not
include
defrauding
grantees
or
recipients
of
federal
funds.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
false
or
fraudulent
claims
were
submitted
to
the
united
states.
indeed,
we
don't
know
from
the
record
what
was
submitted
to
the
united
states,
when
it
was
submitted
to
the
united
states,
what
it
contained.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
district
court
very
carefully
analyzed
that
evidence,
as
well
as
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
and
found
that
an
inference
could
not
be
drawn
with
respect
to
what
had
happened
or
when
it
happened
because
there
is
a
time
lag
to
drawing
an
inference
from
certificates
of
performance
when
you
don't
know
when
those
certificates
were
made,
when
they
were
submitted
to
the
government,
what
they
said.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
navy,
you
mean
in
connection
with
the
litigation
or
in
connection--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
answer
to
your
question
as
i
understand
it,
justice
ginsburg,
is
yes,
the
navy
had
the
right
to
test
the
equipment,
look
at
the...
look
at
the
specifications,
examine
the
specifications,
ask
for
corrections
if
they
were
unsatisfied,
to
test
the
products.
the
navy
had
the
right
to
do
all
of
those
things.
and
one...
fundamental
to
this
case
is
we
don't
know
whether
they
did,
whether
they
were
satisfied
with
the
generators
as
ultimately
delivered
to
them,
whether
there
were
corrections,
if
there
were
deficiencies
or
deviations
from
the
specifications
when
they
were
first
submitted
to
the
shipyards,
whether
those
were
corrected,
whether
those
deviations
were
immaterial.
because--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
my
understanding...
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
of
that,
justice
kennedy,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
the
government
did
have
the
right
to
follow
the
process
all
the
way
through.
there's
no
evidence
that
they
did
so.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
what
was
in
the
books
and
whether
there
was--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
that
might
be,
justice
kennedy.
regarding
the
terms
of
the
statute,
whether
you
might
interpret
that
as
providing
under
(a)(2),
providing
a
record
or
document
to
the
government
with
the
intention
that
the
government
pay
or
approve
a
claim,
i
think
you'd
have
to
examine
the
evidence
in
that
context.
what
we
don't
have
here,
we
don't
know
what
was
submitted
to
the
government.
what
the
lawyers
representing
the
claimants
in
this
case...
and
this
is
from
page
5a
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition,
footnote
3.
we...
this
is
what
the...
when
they
were
asked
about
this
issue:
we
haven't
shown
you
the
ship
yard's
invoices
to
the
united
states
and
we're
not
going
to
show
you
those.
because
they
are
totally
irrelevant
under
the
false
claims
act.
now,
that
could
not
be
more
wrong,
it
seems
to
us.
you
can't
determine...
if
there's
going
to
be
a
fraud,
a
claim
of
fraud
against
the
united
states,
you
have
to
know
what
the
united
states
received
to
see
whether
it's
fraudulent,
to
see
whether
any
deviation
from
the
facts
were
material,
whether
the
deviation
from
the
specifications
where
maybe
the
product
was
better,
maybe
it
deviated
in
an
insubstantial
way
or
an
immaterial
way,
maybe
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
fix
it.
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
reliance
by
the
government.
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
loss
by
the
government.
and
we
don't
know,
if
there
was
a
loss
by
the
government,
the
quantification
for
the
loss.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
the
way
the
record...
the
record
is
a
little
confusing
with
respect
to
that,
justice
breyer,
but
i
think
that
one
of
the
witnesses...
i
don't
know
how
he
knew--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
one
of
the
witnesses
said,
yes,
the
money
that
we
received
was
money
that
came
from
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
the
definition
of
the
word
"claim".
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
has
to
be
a
claim.
but
then
section...
you're
reading
subsection
(c).
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
subsection
(a)
provides
the
standard
for
liability.
so
you
can
have
a
claim,
but
you're
not
liable
for
a
false
claim
unless
it's
submitted
to
the
government,
unless
it's
knowingly
made
to
get
a
fraudulent
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
i...
i'm
looking
at
the
statute--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
quoted
from
both
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2).
(a)(2)--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it
reads
out
the
words
"by
the
government"
from
that
section,
which
is
what
the
statute
looked
like
until
it
was
specifically
amended.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they
are
in
(a)(2),
but
the
way
justice...
the
way
justice
kennedy
was
reading
it,
i
respectfully
submit,
would
read
out
those
"by
the
government".
what
(a)(2)--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
presented
to
the
government
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it's
presented
to
the
government
or,
under
(a)(2),
knowingly
made
to
get--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
has
to
be
made
or
used
to
get
a
claim
paid
or
approved.
in
other
words,
it
has
to
be
something
that's
created,
then
given
to
the
government,
so
in
order
to
get
a
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
what
i
am--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
think
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
is...
and
this
is
essentially
what
this
court
unanimously
decided
20
years
ago
in
the
tanner
case,
that
these
cases
about
defrauding
the
government
must
involve
something
that
causes
the
government
to
suffer
a
loss,
some
something
that
impacts
the
government.
even...
even
the
government
today
is
making
the
same
statement
that
there
has
to
be
a
loss.
what
i'm
saying
with...
it's
important,
justice
kennedy,
that...
that
if
you
are
going
to
want
to
get
something
paid
or
approved
by
the
government,
you
have
to
do
something
that
gets
it
to
the
government
in
some
fashion.
and
reading
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
and
(a)(3)
and
the
tanner
decision
and
the
history
of
this
statute
from
1863
all
suggest
very
strongly,
i
submit,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
that
it's...
involves
fraud
against
the
government.
now,
you
may
submit
something
to
a
prime...
you
may
be
a
subcontractor
that
submits
something
to
the
prime
contractor,
and
this
very...
this
case
is
a
very
good
example
of
it,
and
this
case
is
very
much
like
the
tanner
case.
what
did
the
prime
contractor
do
with
it?
if
it
was
false
or
deficient
or
out
of
specifications,
the
prime
contractor
had
a
right
to
say:
wait
a
minute,
tighten
those
bolts
up
a
little
bit
more,
or
we're
going
to
deduct
it,
a
little
price
from
that,
and
we're
going
to
tell
the
government
that
there's
a
deviation
from
the
specifications.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
that's
just
the
point,
justice
ginsburg.
we
don't
no
one
way
or
the
other
unless
the
evidence
is
submitted.
we
don't
know
what
the
government
received,
so
we
don't
know
whether
the
government
was
deceived.
so,
if
i
submit
that
it
might
well
be
in
this
case...
we
don't
know
how
much
time
elapsed
between
the
submission
of
the
invoices
or
the
other
materials
from
the
subcontractor
to
the
prime
contractor.
what
happened
then
between
then
and
when
the
ships
were
delivered
to
the
navy?
lot
of
things
could
have
happened.
we
don't
know.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
was
a
trial.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
there
was
a
motion
at
the
close
of
the
evidence
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
and
at
that...
it's
at
that
point
that
counsel
said:
we
are
not
going
to
show
you
the
invoices
to
the
united
states.
we're
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's...
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
that's
my
point.
if
you
can't...
if
you
don't
know
what
went
to
the
government,
you
don't
know
whether
a
claim
or
a
document
or
a
statement,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
went
to
the
government,
you
don't
know
whether
what
the
government
got
was
false;
you
don't
know
whether
they--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
not
sure.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the
statute
says--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the
statute
says
is
that
it
is
liability
to
the
government
for
the
damage
the
government
sustains.
now,
it
may
well
be...
there's
penalties
even
if
there
isn't
damage
to
the
government.
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
you
could
say
that,
but
you
don't
know
whether
the
government
got
what
it
wanted.
you
don't
know
whether
the...
if
something
deviates
from
specifications
in
a
contract,
it
might
deviate
on
the
plus
side
of
something,
it
might
deviate
in
an
immaterial
way.
the
contractor,
the
prime
shipyards
here,
and
the
government
had
the
right
to
correct
any
deficiencies.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
you've
done
with
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
left
out
the
link.
what
happened...
what...
the
government
may
have
made...
given
money
to
the
schools.
subcontractors
might
have
submitted
something
false.
the
prime
contractor
might
have
discovered
it
and
said:
correct
this
or--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
it
isn't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
it...
it
might
under
some
circumstances
be
harm.
it
might
not
under
other
circumstances
be
harm.
it
might
be
misleading
in
an
immaterial
way.
it
might...
there
might
have
been
no
reliance
by
the
government.
there
might
have...
the
government
might
have
said...
the
contract
between
the
prime
contractor
and
the
subcontractor
might
have
different
requirements
than
what
the
government
wants.
none
of
those--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
federal
government
may
have
been
injured.
the
question
is
what
does
this
statute
redress?
there
are
other
statutes.
there's
a
major
fraud
provision
of
title
18
that
has
major
penalties
for
fraud
by
subcontractors
against
contractors
in
connection
with
public
projects
just
as
the
one...
like
the
ones
you're
describing.
but
if
this
court's
tanner
decision
is
correct...
and
it
was
only
20
years
ago;
it
was
unanimous...
it
defined
the
term
"defrauding
the
government"
and
it
said
"defrauding
the
government"
means
defrauding
the
government,
not
filing
a
false
claim--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
has
to
be
a
false
claim
paid
by
the
government.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what...
justice
breyer,
what
is
missing
from
your
hypothetical
is
what
went
to
the
government.
suppose
the
prime
contractor
decided
that
the
paint
was
off
white
instead
of
white,
and
that
was
satisfactory.
suppose
the
subcontractor
said
to
the
government:
this
is
a
major
project;
this
is
a
billion
dollar
project;
there
are
all
these
little
things
that
are
out
of
specifications
and
could
be
called
false
or
fraudulent
or
misleading;
we're
going
to
disclose
all
of
these
things
to
the
government.
the
government
has
a
complete
opportunity
to
test
them,
look
at
them,
and
decide
whether
it's
satisfied.
then
the
government
isn't
deceived.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i
think
you
are
taking
the
words
and
isolating
them.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
is
knowingly
making
a
false
record
or
a
false
statement
to
get
a
false
claim
paid.
if
the
government
didn't
pay
a
false
claim,
then
(a)(2)
doesn't
provide
for
liability.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes,
i
should
have
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
if...
i
should
have
said
the
word
"approved"
because
i...
i
was
shortening
it
up.
but
it
does
say
"paid
or
approved".
but
what
has
to
be
done
is
that
the
government
has
to...
what
has
to
be
submitted
is
something
to
cause
the
government
to
pay
or
to
approve
a
false
claim
to
the
government.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
i
might
say
in
addition
to
what
i
have
said,
justice
souter,
is
that
there
is
no
stopping
point
for
that
theory.
the
government
says
as
long
as
the
project
involved
federal
money,
as
long
as
the
project
used
federal
funds,
as
long
as
the
project
might
endanger
the
federal
fisc,
as
long
as
the
program
is
financed
in
part
by
federal
money,
there
would
be
liability
under
this
statute.
given
the
tens
of
thousands
of
government
contracts,
government
funds,
government
financing
of
states,
localities,
universities,
and
so
forth,
there
is
no
limiting
point.
and
what--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't...
i
don't
think,
with
respect,
that
that's
a
fair
reading
of
what
the
government
said
either
in
the
tanner
case,
think
making
essentially
the
same
arguments
which
were
rejected
unanimously
by
this
court,
or
what
it
says
in
its
brief
to
the
court
today.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in...
with
respect
to
that,
the
government
filed
a
brief
in
a
case
called
atkins
versus
mcinteer
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
i
have
the
brief
here...
it
is
not
part
of
the
material
that
is
before
you...
in
which
the
government
said
that
even
if
the
district...
d.c.
circuit
decision
that's
involved
in
this
case,
the
totten
case,
was
correctly
decided,
those
medicare-medicaid
cases
would
be
substantially
covered
under
the
statute
even
under
that
construction
because
the
provider's
claim
is
passed
on
by
the
insurer
to
the
medicare
agency
or
entity.
now,
i
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg,
the
facts
of
that
case
or
the
facts
of
all
of
those
circumstances.
but
the
fact
is
that
if
you
take
this
statute
as
it
was
enacted
in
1863,
all
of
this
used
to
be
a
part
of
one
section
that
talked
in
the
first
case,
the
first
instance,
one
sentence
which
discussed
in
the
first
instance
a
presentation
of
a
claim
to
the
government
and
which
was
the
liability
to
be
imposed
upon
the
claimant.
the
second
part
of
the
sentence
said...
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
people
aiding
the
fraud,
those
people
that
provided
with
records
or
statements
in
order
to
get
the
payment
made.
and
then
the
third
provision
was
the
conspiracy
provision.
those
were
broken
out
into
the
subsections
you
see
today.
in
1982,
congress
specifically
said:
we
are
simply
codifying
the
statute;
we're
not
changing
the
statute.
we
are
making
no
substantive
changes
in
the
statute.
if
you
read
that
provision
in
the
context
of
the
marcus
versus
hess
case,
which
was
in
the
early
'40s,
in
which
the
government...
in
which
the
court
specifically
said
there's
liability
for
an
intermediary
causing
a...
federal
government
to
pay
the
claim.
but
in
that
case,
the
invoices
were
passed
on,
and
the...
and
the
government
entity
in
that
case,
the
public
works
administration,
had
the
opportunity
to
review
and
approve--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
i
may
not
have
heard
your
question.
in
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i...
i
think...
it's
certainly
not
this
case,
because
the...
although
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
do
these
things,
we
don't
know
what
happened.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
if--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
problem
is,
as
this
court
said
in
the...
unanimously
in
the
tanner
case,
given...
forgive
me
for
doing
this,
but
it's
important...
given
the
immense
variety
of
ways
the
federal
government
provides
federal
financial
assistance,
always
accompanied
by
some
restrictions
or
conditions
on
its
use,
the
inability
of
the
substantial
supervision
language
which
the
government
was
advancing
then,
which
it's
sort
of
advancing
now,
does
not
provide
any
test
for
any
real
guidance
or--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
but
it...
but
when
it
was...
when
it
added
that
section,
it
specifically
added
in
the
words
"by
the
government",
which
those
words
were
added
after
the
legislative
history
that
both
the
respondents
and
the
government
cite.
and
it
did
not
change,
justice
kennedy,
the
definition
of
"liability".
it
simply
defined
"claim".
if
the
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
under
both
the...
if
the
claim
by
the
subcontractor
to
the
contractor
is
intended
to
be
passed
on,
that
the...
that
the
contractor
is
an
intermediary,
then
under
marcus
versus
hess,
which
is
the
situation
there,
there
could
be
liability.
i'd
like
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
address
the...
what
seems
to
be
a
controversy
as
to
what
was
submitted
to
the
navy.
in
the
first
place,
the
invoices
were
not
submitted
to
the
navy.
we
know
that.
that's
the
provision
that
i
quoted
before.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
did
not
call
a
single
navy
witness.
they
did
not
call
the
prime
contractor
as
a
witness.
so
we
don't
know
what
the
navy
received,
or
what
the
navy
did
not
receive.
with
respect
to
the
so
called
certification,
that
is
addressed
on
pages
57a
through
59a
of
the
cert
petition
appendix.
this
is
a
district
court
decision,
three
pages
of
discussion.
this
was
an
argument
that
the
relators
came
up
with
relatively
late
when
they
couldn't
explain
why
they
didn't
have
the
invoices
or
what
actually
went
to
the
navy,
and
they
argued
that
bath
submitted
a
false
implied
certification.
then
the
district
court
goes
through
the
evidence
on
pages
57a
to
59a
and
concludes
at
the
top
of
59a
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
requiring...
of
a
required,
continuing
certification
with
respect
to
quality,
which
is
the
issue
tried
in
this
case.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
through
all
of
that
or
all
of
the
evidence,
but
that
is
backing
and
filling.
there...
and
the
question
presented
is
a
correct
question
presented.
as
the
relators
put
it
to
the...
to
the
district
court,
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
we
are
not
going
to
show
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--if
it
was...
if
the
qualification...
if
a...
if
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i...
they...
there
has
to
be...
no.
under
(a)(2),
justice
stevens,
you
could
submit
a
statement
intending
to
get
a
false
claim
approved
or
paid
by
the
government.
now,
the
government
can't
approve
anything
if
it's
not
actually
submitted
to
it,
or
not
intended
to
be
submitted
to
it.
that's
in
the
same
section
of...
of
the
statute.
let
me...
let
me
turn
to
the...
this
is
a
penal
statute.
there
is
a
punitive
statute,
as
you
pointed
out,
in
the
vermont
versus
stevens
case.
there
is
no
meaningful
limitation
on
what
the
government
and
the
respondents
want
in
this
case.
the
government
has
now
come
up
with
this
limitation:
well,
it
must
be
really
a
government
project.
well,
that
isn't
in
the
statute.
that's
basically
the
same
thing
you
unanimously
rejected
in
the
tanner
case.
the
government
said
in
its
brief
if
the
government
is
the
ultimate
source
of
the
funds.
that
goes
back
to
the
example
that
the
chief
justice
was
making.
there
might
be
15
different
layers,
the
way
this
government
works.
money
is
fungible.
it's
impossible
to
trace.
this
statute
is
intended
to
address
claims
made,
or
statements
made
in
connection
with
claims
made,
to...
to
commit
to
defraud
the
government,
and
defraud
the
government
irrespective
of
the
definition
of
(a),
but
was
not
put
in
section
(a),
the
liability
section.
the
congress
knows
how
to
put
those
words
in
statutes.
they
were
in
the
major
fraud
statute,
the...
the
case
that
this
court
distinguished
in
dixon,
in...
in
tanner.
the
dixon
case
was
money
given...
paid
to
or
on
behalf
of
the
government.
there
is
language
like
that
throughout
the
congressional
statutes.
we
don't
know
in
this
case
whether
the
government
was
defrauded,
or
was
intended
to
be
defrauded,
because
there
is
this
big
space
between
what
went
on
between
the
subcontractors
and
the
shipbuilders
and
what
went
on
between
the
shipbuilders
and
the
government.
there
could
have
been
all
kinds
of
dialogue.
there
could
have
been
disclosures.
there
might
be
deviations
from
the
specifications
in
any
kind
of
government
contract.
but
this
statute
has
to
have
a
limitation
point.
and
if
you
look
at
it
from
1863
up
to
the
present,
it
is
intended
just
as
the
tanner
case
said.
and
in
marcus
versus
hess
you
said
that
the
criminal
false
claim
statutes
have
to
be
construed
identically
with
the
civil
false
claims
provisions
if
they
contain
identical
language.
371
has
the
same
language
as
the
false
claims
act's,
and
the
tanner
case
is
dispositive.
