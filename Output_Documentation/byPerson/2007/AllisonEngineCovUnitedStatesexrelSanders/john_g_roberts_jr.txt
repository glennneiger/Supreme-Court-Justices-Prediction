chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
today
in
case
07-214,
allison
engine
company
versus
united
states
ex
rel.
sanders
and
thacker.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
i
don't
understand
that
point.
let's
say
allison
engine
is
defrauding
bath,
but
bath
makes
ships
for
a
lot
of
people,
boats,
whatever
they
make.
allison
engine
is
defrauding,
saying
these
engines,
you
know,
work
this
way
and,
in
fact,
they
don't.
it
doesn't
know
bath
is
going
to
use
some
of
them
in
a
government
ship
as
opposed
to
a
private
ship.
so
you're
saying
in
that
context,
since
there's
no
intent
to
defraud
the
government,
there's
no
liability?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
just
sells
them
engines.
it
doesn't
know
what
bath
is
going
to
do
with
them.
they
are
going
to
put
some
in
private
boats
and
some
in
the
government
boats.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
far
down
the
line?
i
mean,
let's
take
that
hypothetical.
the
government
gives
money
to
the
state
to
build
a
school.
the
school
has
to
be
painted
as
part
of
that,
so
the
school
contractor,
the
prime
contractor,
takes
some
of
the
money
from
the
federal
government
and
pays
the
painter.
the
painter
needs
to
buy
paint.
so
the
painter
takes
some
of
the
federal
money
and
pays
the
paint
company.
the
paint
company
has
to
get
the
chemicals
from
somebody.
so
the
paint
company
takes
some
of
the
money
and
pays
the
chemical
company.
and
at
that
point,
the
chemical
companies
fraudulently
added,
you
know,
a
dollar
on
to
the
cost
of
the
chemicals.
so
that
dollar
goes
all
the
way
through.
so
the
government
ends
up
paying
a
dollar
more
because
of
the
fraud
five,
six,
seven
times
down
the
line.
can
an
uninterested
person
bring
a
qui
tam
action
against
the
chemical
manufacturer
because
of
that
fraud?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
a
presentment
requirement.
that's
in
(a)(1.
it's
that
the
claim
be
paid,
the
fault
claim,
be
paid
by
the
government.
and
what
you're
saying
is
when
the
government
pays
the
state,
that
pays
the
school,
that
pays
the
contractor,
that
pays
the
paint...
blah,
blah,
blah...
that
that
is
payment
by
the
government
of
a
false
claim
because
the
chemical
manufacturer
six
or
seven
steps
down
the
line
commits
fraud.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
helmer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument...
your
understanding
of
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
exactly
the
same
if
the
words
"by
the
government"
were
replaced
by
"with
federal
funds"?
you
think
those
are...
you
think
the
statute
is
exactly
the
same
if
it
said
"with
federal
funds"
instead
of
"by
the
government"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
the
government...
when
the
phrase
'86?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
were
a
lot
of
statutes
that
said
"with
federal
funds",
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
did
the
congress
add
the
phrase
"by
the
government"
instead
of
"with
federal
funds"
if
it
meant
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
so
i
guess
i
get
back...
you
read
"by
the
government"
as
if
it
said
"with
federal
funds"?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
in
fact,
as
you
suggest,
allison
submitted
the
certificate
to
the
navy
person
at
the
shipyard,
then
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
not
in
fact
presented
here?
because
the
question
presented
assumes
that
there
had
not
been
a
submission
to
the
federal
government
of
the
false...
false
claim.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
helmer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
mr.
olson,
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
