did
the
navy
have
the
right
to
audit
the
subcontractor's
books?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
audit
the
subcontractor's
books
and
they
don't
discover
a
fraud
and
leave.
would
there
be
liability
then
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
books
show
that
x
dollars
were
spent
for
certain
parts
and
that
was
far
too
much.
that
was
an
inflated
figure.
it
fools
the
government.
the
government
then
paid
the
subcontractor...
pays
the
contractor;
the
contractor
pays
the
subcontractor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
say
(a),
but
we're
talking
about
(a)--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
connection
with
(c).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
were
quoting
from
(a)(1).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that,
but
doesn't
(a)(2)
stand
by
itself,
especially
as...
as
(c)
is
written,
(c)
and
(2),
(c)
and
(a)(2)
make
perfect
grammatical
sense
without
any
presentation
to
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
said
given
to
the
government.
does
it
say
given
to
the
government?
it
says
"paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
olson,
it
seems
to
me
you're
fighting
a
hypothetical.
let's
say
they
built
a
lousy
school,
sub
spec.
the
roof
is
falling
in;
the
plumbing
leaks.
it's
a
fraud,
but
they've
given
the
money,
the
feds
have
given
the
money
to
the
states
and
the
states
have
let
this
slip
by.
justice
scalia's
point
was
the
federal
government
has
been
injured.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
tanner
case
didn't
confront
the
statute
which
has
the
definition
of
claims
that
justice
breyer
is
putting
to
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
statute
that
we're
looking
at,
in
effect,
defines
what
a
fraud
against
the
government
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
that
that
accords
with
the
definition
of
(c).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
says
the
government
will
reimburse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
meant
provide.
it
has
provided
it
already.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
own
school
hypothetical,
there's
liability.
