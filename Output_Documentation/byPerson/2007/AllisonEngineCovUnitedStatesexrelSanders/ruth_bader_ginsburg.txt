what
about
the
certificates
of
conformance
with
specifications
of?
i
believe
they
were
the
navy's
specifications
and
allison
submitted
to
someone
those
certificates
of
conformance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
government
have
asked...
could
the
navy
have
asked
for
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
in
connection...
the
navy...
the
engines
are
being
supplied
for
navy
destroyers
and
the
navy
obviously
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the...
they
measure
up
to
the
specifications.
so
my
question
is
whether
in
this
procedure
for
dealing
with
subcontractors
there
is
any
kind
of
audit
where
the
navy
can
say,
we
want
to
see
the
certificates
of
conformance
for
those
engines
or
other
documents
relating
to
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
disguised,
how
would
the...
how
would
the
prime
contractor
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
wasn't
any
trial,
was
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
could...
they
would
have
at
a
minimum,
even
if
your
theory
is
not
correct...
they
would
have
to
prove
loss
to
the
government.
otherwise
they
would
have
no
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
government
certainly
has
that
in
its
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps
we
should
ask
the
government
to
explain
what
its
position
is.
but
one
of
the
points
that
has
been
raised
in
opposition
to
your
argument
is
that
your
interpretation
would
cut
out
claims
that
today
are
regarded
as
properly
presented
under
the
false
claims
act.
and
the
one
that
was
featured
was
false
claims
for
medicare
or
medicaid
reimbursement,
because
those
are
presented
not
to
the
government
but
to
an
intermediary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
whole
difference...
the
whole
difference,
then,
is
if
the...
the
invoices
are
passed
on,
as
opposed
to
the
government
having
the
right,
if
it
so
chooses,
to
inspect
the
books
and
records?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
difference
is
if
the
government
gets
the
invoices
from
the
contractor,
then
there's
a
claim
under
the
false
claims
act.
but
if,
instead,
the
subcontractor
is
required
to
make
its
books
and
records
available
on
request
to
the
government,
that's
not
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
made...
i
thought
you
said
that
it
is
this
case
that
the
government
had
the
right--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
audit
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson
said
on
the
medicare
that
the
providers,
that
the
intermediary
does
present
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--before...
before
you
finish,
the
major
objection
is
the
one
that
justice
breyer
just
voiced,
that
your
position
is
vastly
overbroad
and
every
time
there's
government
money
there
will
be...
one
of
these
qui
tam
people
can
come
in.
what
are
the
limiting
principles
that
you
say
attach
to
this
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whose
certificate
is
it?
is
it
the
contractor's
certificate
that
everything
that
the
subs
have
done
or
the
certificate
of
conformance
that
allison
provided,
that
sofco
provided?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
only
the
contract.
you
didn't
show
that
in
fact
that
had
happened,
that
the
certificates
of
conformance
actually
were
shown
to
a
naval
officer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
has
been
a
statement,
in
opposition
to
your
position,
that
the
way
you
read
(a)(2)
would
render
(a)(1)
useless,
that
everything
would
fall
within
(a)(2).
is
there
a
distinction
between
what
comes
under
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2),
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
