what
about
the
statement
that
mr.
olson
quoted
during
his
argument,
when
counsel
for
plaintiffs
said
to
the
jury:
you
haven't
seen
anything
that
was
submitted
to
the
navy
and
you're
not
going
to
see
anything
that
was
submitted
to
the
navy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
was
your
statement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
certificate
of
performance
made
its
way
to
the
navy.
that
was
required
by
contract.
why
did
you
not
introduce
direct
evidence
of
that
in
your
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
navy
contracted
with
two
shipyards
to
build
destroyers
that
needed
generator
sets
for
electrical
power.
the
shipyards,
in
turn,
contracted
with
petitioner,
allison
engine
to
build
the
generator
sets.
allison
engine
subcontracted
with
petitioner
general
tool
company
to
assemble
the
generator
sets
and
general
tool
subcontracted
with
petitioner
southern
ohio
fabricators
to
manufacture
the
generator
sets.
the
subcontracts
required
that
each
generator
set
be
accompanied
by
a
certificate
of
conformance,
certifying
that
the
unit
was
manufactured
according
to
navy
specifications.
former
general
tool
company
employees
filed
the
qui
tam
action
that
is
now
before
us
asserting
claims
under
two
provisions
of
the
false
claims
act.
31
u.s.c.
section
3729(a)(2),
which
imposes
to
the
liability
on
any
person
who
knowingly
uses
a
false
statement
to
get
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
paid
or
proved
by
the
government.
and
31
u.s.c.
section
3729(a)(3),
which
reaches
conspiracies
to
defraud
the
government
by
getting
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
allowed
or
paid.
at
trial,
respondents
failed
to
introduce
evidence
that
petitioners
had
submitted
a
false
claim
to
the
navy.
the
district
court
granted
petitioners
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
concluding
that
without
such
proof,
respondent's
evidence
was
legally
insufficient.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
in
relevant
part
holding
that
respondentâ€™s
claims
did
not
require
proof
of
an
intent
to
cause
a
false
claim
to
be
paid
by
the
government.
rather,
that
court
held
that
it
was
enough
to
show
that
petitioners
intended
to
cause
such
a
claim
to
be
paid
by
private
entity
using
government
funds.
we
disagree
with
that
analysis.
we
hold
that
it
is
insufficient
for
a
plaintiff
asserting
a
section
3729(a)(2)
claim,
to
show
merely
that
the
false
statements
used
resulted
in
the
payment
or
approval
of
the
claim
or
that
government
money
was
used
to
pay
the
false
or
fraudulent
claim.
instead,
such
a
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
defendant
intended
that
the
false
statement
be
material
to
the
government's
decision
to
pay
or
approve
the
false
claim.
this
does
not
mean
that
section
3729(a)(2)
requires
proof
that
a
defendant's
false
statement
was
in
fact
submitted
to
the
government.
instead,
a
subcontractor
violates
section
3729(a)(2),
if
it
submits
a
false
statement
to
the
prime
contractor,
intending
that
contractor
to
use
the
statement
to
get
the
government
to
pay
its
claim.
similarly,
it
is
not
enough
under
section
3729(a)(3)
for
a
plaintiff
to
show
that
the
alleged
conspirators
agreed
upon
a
fraud
scheme
that
had
the
effect
of
causing
a
private
entity
to
make
payments,
using
money
obtained
from
the
government.
instead,
it
must
be
shown
that
they
intended
to
defraud
the
government.
because
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
on
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
sections
3729(a)(2)
and
(3),
we
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
