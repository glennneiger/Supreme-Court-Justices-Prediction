i
must
be
just
missing
something
here.
tell
me
what
i'm
missing.
what
about
the
definition
of
"claim"?
it
says
a
claim
includes
a
request
under
a
contract
for
money
or
property,
and
the
request
is
made
to
the
contractor
if
the
united
states
provides
any...
any
of
the
money.
is
there
an
issue
here
as
to
whether
some
of
the
money
provided...
are
you
saying
there
was
no
money
provided
by
the
united
states
or
maybe
there
was
no
money
provided?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
so
why
doesn't
that
end
it?
why
doesn't...
how
do
you
win,
then,
given
the
language
i
just
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
"claim".
and
there
has
to
be
a
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right,
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
why
the
definition...
it
seems
to
me
at
the
moment...
that's
why
i'd
like
your
view...
that
the
language
is
perfectly
ambiguous,
the
language
of
"knowingly
makes
a
false
statement
to
get
a
false
claim
paid.
"
now,
the
"false
claim"
is
the
claim
that
they
made
to
the
contractor,
because
that's
the
definition.
and
you
are
saying:
well,
they
made
this
statement
to
get
a
false
claim
paid
by
the
government.
now,
you
could
read
those
words
"paid
by
the
government"
to
say
"and
there
has
to
be
a
causal
connection.
"
which
is
what
you're
saying,
that
you
have
to
make
the
false
statement,
make
the
claim,
and
that
led
the
government
to
pay.
but
you
could
also
say
it's
paid
by
the
government
when
the
money
to
pay
it
comes
out
of
government
funds,
because
it
was
paid
by
the
government
even
though
the
government
gave
the
money
to
build
the
school
100
years
ago.
but
it's
there
in
the
bank
account,
and
then
the
contractor
took
the
money
from
the
bank
account
that
the
government
put
in
and
paid
it.
in
such
a
case,
linguistically,
you
can
say
it's
paid
by
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
a
false
claim.
that's
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
it
was
a
false
claim,
which
it
was.
it's
false,
and
it
is
a
claim
to
the
general.
and
was
it
paid
by
the
government?
yes.
it
was
paid
by
the
government,
even
though
everything
you
said
is
true,
because
the
money
to
pay
it
came
from
government
funds.
so
that's
why
i'm
having
a
problem.
i
can
read
those
words
"paid
by
the
government"
either
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
you
are
saying
is
covered,
i
take
it...
and
this
is...
i
want
to
know
how
this
has
worked
out...
what
is
covered
is...
imagine
government
grant
programs.
and
suppose
there
are
vast
numbers
of
grant
programs
now
that
go
to
all
kinds
of
entities
throughout
the
country,
and
a
large
portion
of
which
are
just
grants.
they're
paid
and
the
government
is
not
going
to
get
a
penny
back.
now,
there
are
instances
of
frauds
in
such
situations
of
subs
against
the
person
who
gets
the
grant.
and
in...
i
can't
imagine
a
case...
maybe
imagine,
but
it
would
be
imaginary...
where
the
government
couldn't
say:
but
we
got
less
than
the
grant
was
supposed
to
pay
for.
and
you're
saying
all
those
are
covered.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
get
less
than
it
was
supposed
to
get.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
this
is
what
surprises
me
on
your
side.
it's
20
years
later.
and
if
all
those
things
are
covered,
given
the
vast
extent
of
government
grant
programs
in
the
united
states,
has
your
interpretation
worked
to
bring
within
this
statute,
and
lots
of
qui
tam
cases
against
municipal
frauds
of
all
kinds,
things
that
they
just
never
thought
of
at
the
time
of
the
civil
war?
do
you
see
what
the
question
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
there
been
a
lot
of
such
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difference
is
that
government
money
today
is
in
everything.
so
if
it's
in
everything,
then
everything
is
going
to
become
subject
to
this
false
claims
act.
and
of
course
i
exaggerate
by
using
the
word
"everything",
but
only
a
little.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose...
you
just
said
to
justice
scalia...
if
you
have
one
minute;
i
rather
missed
that...
that
your
point
was
if
you
lose
on
that
point
you
just
made
and
it
isn't
"with
federal
funds"
and
it
is
that
the
government
has
to
pay
the
claim,
you
still
win.
that
was
your
point
to
justice
scalia,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
was
that
argument?
because
you
said
it
wasn't
in
the
brief,
and
what
is
it?
how
do
you
still
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
