well,
that's
not
strictly
correct.
i
mean,
it
"paid
or
approved".
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
means
there
is
a
third
way,
and
the
third
way
of
reading
it
is
if
the
sub
makes
the
false
statement
to
the
general
contractor
in
order
ultimately
to
get
a
false
claim,
i.e.,
the
ultimate
contractor's
claim
for
conforming
work,
approved
or
this
particular
claim
approved
by
the
government
when
the
government
makes
the
ultimate
decision
to
pay
the
general
contractor,
that
would
be
covered
by
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
can
simply
be
done
by
the
false
claim
to
the
general
contractor,
who
either
accepts
it
as
true
or,
for
that
matter,
knowingly
understands
that
it
is
false,
and
ultimately
submits
the
same
claim,
i.e.,
as
an
element
of
its
ultimate
bill
for
the
whole
project.
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect,
i
think
there
is
a
limiting
point.
you
are
certainly
right
when
you
talk
about
the
thousands
of
contracts
that
the
government
ultimately
makes
or
finances
for
the
benefit
of
lower
units
of
government.
but
it
does
not
follow
from
the
government's
theory
that
if
the
united
states
makes
grants
to
a
sub
unit
of
government,
not
for
the
purpose
of
a
given
contract
or
a
given
project,
it
simply
makes
grants,
revenue
sharing
sorts
of
things,
it
doesn't
follow
from
the
government's
position
that
when
one
of
those
sub
units
of
government
then
makes
a
contract
spending
part
of
that
money,
that
it's
covered
by
this
statute.
this
statute
would
cover
the
myriad
of
grants
made
for
particular
contracts.
it
would
not
cover
every
subset
of
funds
in
a
lower
government
unit,
some
of
which
had
been
contributed
by
the
national
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
--injured
by
it
because
it,
in
effect,
gets
less
than
it
paid
for?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
were
a
cost
plus
contract,
the
government
would
pay
an
extra
10,000
and
it
would
lose.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
they...
if
they
simply
supplied
defective
parts,
the
government
would
get
less
of
a
machine
than
it
paid
for.
but
in
the...
in
justice
scalia's
example,
the
government
ultimately
ends
up
with
exactly
what
it
bargained
for,
and
the
person
who's
out
is
the
person
who
paid
for
too
much
labor,
which
is
general...
is
that
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
you
would
still...
your
theory
would
still
cover
the
case
of
the...
of
the
agency
that
gets
10
percent
of
its
budget
by...
through
a
general
grant
from
the
united
states,
no
matter
what
it
spent
its
money
on,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
has
no
connection
with
particular
contracts.
if
in
fact
a
fraudulent
claim
was
presented
to
that
agency,
it
would
fall
within
the
qui
tam
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
no
strings
attached.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
wouldn't
there
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
when
your
salary
is
paid,
in
effect
the
government's
interest
stops
when
it
pays
for
your
labor.
in
the...
in
the
hypothetical
in
which
the
government
funds
10
percent
of
a
sub
agency's
operating
budget,
presumably
its
intent
generalized
goes
to
everything
that
agency
does.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
contract
between
the
navy
and
bath,
was
there
a
provision
that
allison's
invoices
would
be
shown
to
the
navy?
in
other
words,
was
the
parallel
provision
in
the
contract
with
the...
with
the
general
the
same
as
the
provision
between
the
general
and
the
sub?
justice
david
h.
souter
available
but
not
necessarily
transmitted.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
contract
between
bath
and
allison
says:
you
give
those
to
us,
and
we
give
them
to
the
navy.
it
was
specific
in
saying
they
go...
your
invoices,
your...
your
certificates,
go
to
the
navy?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
understand
that.
