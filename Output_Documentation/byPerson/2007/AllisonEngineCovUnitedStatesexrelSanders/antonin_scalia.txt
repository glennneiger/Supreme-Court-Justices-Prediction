justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
in
addition
to
being
a
claim,
that's
not
enough
reliability?
it
has
to
be
a
claim
that's
presented
to
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
that
(c)
does
is
tell
you
what
a
claim
is.
so
that,
even
if
it's
not
a
claim
against
the
government
but
just
a
claim
against
a
subcontractor,
that
still
can
be
the
basis
for
liability
so
long
as
it's
presented
to
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
other
side
concede
that
point,
that
you
have
to
prove
loss
to
the
government?
i
don't
think
they
do,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
that
the
missed
funds
which
are
in
the
hands
of
subcontract...
of
contractors,
harms
the
government,
even
though
it
doesn't
come
out
of
the
government's
pocket,
because
those
funds
were
given
for
a
particular
purpose,
and
if
that
purpose
is
frustrated,
the
government
is
harmed.
that
would
work,
without
saying
that
the
government
has
lost
any
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
the
government
gives
money
for
building
schools,
okay,
to
a
state
and
a
fraudulent
claim
is
submitted
as...
in
connection
with
the
construction
of
the
school.
the
government
has
been
cheated
in
that
the
money
it
gave
for
a
school
is
not
going
to
the
school;
some
of
it
is
going
into
the
hands
of
the
fraudulent
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
that's
a
different
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
talking
now
about
the
point
of
whether
the
government
itself
has
to
suffer
any
harm
other
than
the
fact
that
the
money
it
gave
was
not
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
gave
it.
that
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
correct
in
this
that
without
the
claim
definition,
the
statute
would
not
cover
a
fraudulent
submission
by
the
subcontractor
to
the
contractor
which
is
known
to
be
passed
on
to
the
government
ultimately?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
that
definition,
the
claim
would
be
made
against
the
contractor,
not
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
therefore,
wouldn't
be
a
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
another
question.
suppose
the
subcontractor...
the
fraud
consists
of
inflating
the
hours
spent
in
a
cost
plus
contract.
so
the
subcontractor
submits
and
receives
payment
for
$10,000
more
than
the
subcontractor
deserved.
all
right?
but
that
all
comes
out
of
the
hide
of
the
contractor.
the
contractor
gets
the
same
amount
of
money
from
the
federal
government
and
the
fraud
only
harms
the
contractor.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
not
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
hundred
dollars
more
a
can.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
to
know
that.
he
has
to
know
that
his
bill
is
going
to
be
sent
up
the
line
to
the
government.
"knowingly
makes,
uses
or
causes
to
be
made
or
used
a
false
record
to
get
a
false
or
fraudulent--
"
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
if
he
knows
it,
serve
him
right.
but
this
other
guy
thinks
he's
just
honestly
cheating
the
guy
who's
buying
the
chemicals.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
shock
me.
i
don't
know.
it
doesn't
shock
me
at
all.
if
indeed
the
object
of
this
is
to
prevent
fraud
upon
the
government
and
if
the
government
has
not
been
deceived
at
all,
get
yourself
a
new
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
statute
doesn't
have
to
cover
every
ill
in
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
injuring
the
federal
government
would...
it
would
suffice
to
injure
the
federal
government
that
the
schools
are
shoddy
and
the
roofs
are
leaking?
that
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
federal
government
is
not
out
of
pocket
any
more,
but
the
program
that
it...
that
it
was
desirous
of
encouraging
is
simply
not
as
good
as
it
would
have
been
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
it
was
not
established
that
anything
from
this
defendant
got
to
the
navy.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
where
in
the
record
is
there
some
indication
that
some...
some
paper
from...
with
a
fraudulent
representation
made
it
up
to
the
navy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
what
certificates
are,
i
mean,
you
know,
their
general
content.
but
was
there
anything
in
the
record
that
a
certificate
from
allison
went
to
the
navy
with
allison's
signature
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
there's
less
to
this
case
than
we
had
thought.
my
goodness,
even
under
the
petitioner's
theory,
you
win.
if
indeed
a
fraudulent
document
was
given
to
bath
and
bath
passed
that
on,
i
think
the
petitioners
would
have
conceded--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there's
a
cause
of
action.
what
is
all
this
fuss
about,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
had
said
that
in
your
brief
because
we
could
have
saved
ourselves
a
lot
of
reading.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
whose...
whose
contract
required
this?
it's
a
strange
provision
to
be
in
the
contract
between
allison
and
bath.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
contract
between
allison
and
bath
said
that
this
certificate
from
allison
had
to
be
presented
to
the
navy?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
bath
would
have
been
in
breach
of
its
contract
with
allison
unless
it
passed
these
things
on
to
the
navy?
that's
why
i
say
it's
a
strange
provision
to
be
in
the
contract
between
bath
and
allison.
justice
antonin
scalia
allison
could
sue
bath
for
not
passing
the
certificate
on
to
the
navy?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
this
point
in
response
to
the
petition
for
cert?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know,
usually
we
take
a
case
to
decide
the
question
presented;
and
if
this
question
is
really
not
before
us
you
should
have
told
us
that.
