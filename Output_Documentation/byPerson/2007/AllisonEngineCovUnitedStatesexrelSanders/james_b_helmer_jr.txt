mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court:
electricity
is
the
critical
component
in
a
modern
warship
that
allows
it
to
fight,
to
defend
itself,
and
to
carry
out
its
mission.
because
of
that,
the
navy
imposed
rigid
requirements
on
all
who
work
on
its
generator
sets
in
manufacturing
those
generator
sets.
those
rigid
requirements
were
passed
down
from
the
navy
to
bath.
bath
was
ordered
by
the
navy
to
pass
those
down
in
writing
to
each
of
its
subcontractors
who
were
going
to
work
on
these
gen-sets,
and
bath
did
that.
each
of
the
subcontractors
in
this
case
knew
they
were
working
on
the
ddg-51
project,
which
is
the
arleigh
burke-class
destroyers.
they
knew
that
military
requirements
were
called
out
in
their
paperwork
that
had
to
be
met;
and
they
did
not
satisfy
those
military
requirements
and
yet
submitted
both
claims
for
payment
and,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
pointed
out,
certificates
of
compliance.
if
you
look
at
the
sixth
circuit's
joint
appendix
at
page
620,
you're
going
to
see,
at
paragraph
6.1
in
the
contract
between
bath
iron
works
and
allison,
the
subcontractor,
that
allison
was
required,
when
it
delivered
the
gen-sets
to
the
shipyard
to
give
a
certificate
of
conformance
that
all
of
these
rigid
requirements
had
been
satisfied,
and
that
certificate
of
conformance
had
to
be
given
to
the
united
states
navy.
and
third,
until
that
certificate
of
conformance
was
given
to
the
united
states
navy,
no
money;
no
money
was
going
to
be
paid
to
allison.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
there
are
two
certificates
of
conformance,
you're
absolutely
correct.
what
i'm
speaking
of
is
the
certificate
of
conformance
from
the
defendant
in
this
case.
they
have
to
take
and
give
that
to
the
shipyard
that
says:
we
have
met
all
the
requirements,
the
navy
requirements;
and
we
have
to
give
that
to
the
u.s.
navy.
the
u.s.
navy
then
takes
that
certificate
and
releases
the
gen-set.
it's
under
lock
and
key.
it
releases
the
gen-set--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--to
be
installed
in
the
ship.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
you
were
told
that
earlier
this
morning,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
if
you'll
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
the
sixth
circuit
joint
appendix,
at
page
620;
it's
clause
6.1...
talks
about
the
certificates.
the
certificates
are
in
the
record
starting
at
joint
appendix,
sixth
circuit
joint
appendix
515--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
contract
with
bath
required
the
navy
to
receive
that
for
allison
to
be
paid.
there
was
evidence
in
this
case
that
allison
was,
in
fact,
paid
for
delivering
these
gen-sets.
that's
circumstantial
evidence
that
they
did
submit
their
certificates
of
conformance--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
that...
i
made
that
statement,
and
that
was
not
my
statement.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
my
statement
was:
you
are
not
going
to
see
the
invoices
from
allison...
the
invoices,
not
the
certificates
of
conformance,
not
the
invoices
from
bath
to
the
navy.
you're
not
going
to
see
those.
but
the
invoices
from
allison
to
bath
were
all
admitted
into
the
record
in
this
case.
they're
all
summarized.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
your
honor,
this
case--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--this
case
is
not
a
outlier
on
the
ends
of
this
statute.
it
is
squarely
in
the
middle
of
(a)(2).
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
your
honor,
anything
that
i
can
do
to
help
the
court.
i
apologize
if
i
didn't
write
the
brief
better
than
i
could
have.
but
i
do
have
another
point
that
i...
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
addition
to
what's
in
the
record
in
this
case.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
1863
version
of
the
false
claims
act,
which
continues
on
in
1943,
the
statute
talks
about
in
the
second
clause...
and
the
second
clause
is
what
is
now
known
as
(a)(2)...
it
talks
about
a
false
record
or
statement
being
made
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
or
aiding
to
obtain
payment.
it
does
not
say,
and
it
never
said,
that
there
has
to
actually
be
payment,
there
has
to
actually
be
payment.
now
the
statute
reads
today
"to
get
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
"
my
point
is...
and
the
rainwater
case,
justice
scalia,
that
i
think
you
may
have
been
referring
to
says
that...
the
government
does
not
have
to
have
a
monetary
loss
for
there
to
be
a
false
claims
act
violation.
however,
for
there
to
be
a
violation
of
(a)(2),
the
false
record
or
statement
that's
presented,
the
false
record
or
statement
that's
made,
has
to
be
made
with
the
purpose
of
reaching
federal
funds.
that's
what
the
statute
originally
said.
that
language
was
taken
out
in
1982.
we
all
seem
to
agree
that
the
'82
recodification
did
not
change
any
of
the
meaning
or
purpose
of
the
statute--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
there
were.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
the
legislative
history
is
dark
on
that
subject.
but
i
have
two
answers
for
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
if
you
look
at
the
'82
version
of
the
statute,
there
were
six
liability
provisions
set
out.
a
seventh
was
added
in
'86,
(a)(7).
but
of
the
first
six
that
were
added
in
'82,
when
they
broke
this
long
sentence
down
into
parts,
every
one
of
those
provisions
except
for
(a)(2}
dealt
with
either
"by
the
government"
or
"defrauding
the
government".
(a)(7)
likewise
has
such
similar
language.
my
first
point
to
you
is
that
i
believe
that
when
congress
amended
this
statute
in
'86
it
wanted
all
provisions
to
be
consistent
with
each
other
in
that
sense
that
we're
talking
about
fraud
on
the
government,
not
fraud
against
private
parties,
fraud
on
the
government.
the
second
response
i
would
make
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
we
don't
read
"by
the
government"
as
meaning
presented
to
the
government
or
even
paid
by
the
government.
we
read
(a)(2),
because
without
that
language
on
(a)(2),
if
you
read
the
definition
of
(a)(2).
by
adding
the
words
"by
the
government",
the
congress
has
limited
this
to
directing
to
federal
funds.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
well,
i
believe
they...
that
was
the
first
point
that
i
was
making
to
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
and
my
point
there
is
that
(a)(2)
covers
making
a
false
record
or
statement
to
get
a
false
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
in
this
case,
they
were
required...
allison
was
required
by
its
contract
with
bath
and
the
navy
to
submit
a
certificate
of
conformance
to
bath
and
the
navy
to
release
the
gen-set
for
installation
into
the
destroyer.
without
that
certificate
of
conformance...
and
we
spent
5
weeks
in
front
of
a
jury
talking
about
why
they
were
false,
why
each
of
those
were
false...
without
that
certificate
of
conformance,
the
gen-set
could
not
have
been
released
to
be
installed
in
the
ship
and
allison
could
not
have
been
paid.
that's
what
section
6.1
of
the
contract
provides.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
we
did
put
all
the
certificates
of
conformance
that
were
given
to
bath
in
the
record
of
this
case.
and
all
of
those
by
the
terms
of
allison's
contract
with
bath
had
to
be
shown
to
the
u.s.
navy
employee
on
site
at
the
shipyard.
and
that
contract
was
also
admitted
into
evidence.
but
we
did
not--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--no,
ma'am,
we
did
not
have
a
witness
who
testified
that
this
certificate
was
given
to
ensign
so-and-so.
but--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--it...
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
the
contract
between
bath
and
allison
that
i'm
speaking
about
now
that
flowed...
that
also
flowed
down
the
u.s.
navy's
requirements
that
these
gen-sets
be...
be
built
rigidly
to
the
specifications
set
out
by
the
navy.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
had...
it
had
to
be
shown
to
the
navy.
if
you
want
to
get
paid,
you
have
to
show
it
to
the
navy,
and
then
the
navy
will
release
the
gen-set.
see
they
build
these
ships
around
the
gen-sets.
they
are
so
huge
that
you
don't
install
them
on
a
destroyer;
you
build
the
destroyer
up
around
it.
so
before
you
can
release
those
to
the
shipyard
for
construction,
you
had
to
have
the
certificates
of
conformance.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
justice
souter,
it
was
different.
there
is
a
provision
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
was
referring
to.
you
will
find
it
at
page
415
of
the
sixth
circuit's
joint
appendix.
that
provision
required
that
when
allison
made
a
certificate
to
get
paid
to
the
navy...
i'm
sorry,
strike
that...
when
bath
made
a
certificate
to
the
navy
to
get
paid,
it
had
to
have
available
for
the
u.s.
navy
all
of
the
underlying
documentation.
all
of
the
bills,
the
invoices,
and
certifications
had
to
be
available
to
show
the
navy.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
not
necessarily
stapled
to
the
invoice
and
given
to
the
navy,
but
they
had
to
be
available.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
it
was
specific
in
saying
your
certificate
of
conformance
goes
to
the
navy.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
it
did
not
say
in
the
provision
that
i
have
cited
to
the
court,
your
invoice.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
and
that
was
why
i
said,
justice
alito,
to
the
trial
court,
not
to
the
jury,
that
the
invoices
are
irrelevant.
and
i...
i
didn't
make
that
up.
that
comes
out
of
the
bornstein
opinion.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
the
certificate
was
required.
your
honor,
yes,
that
was
required.
the
invoices
had
to
be
available--
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
the
way
it
reads,
allison
is
supposed
to
hand
the
certificate
to
the
navy
employee
at
the
shipyard.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
i
think
that's
fair
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
we
opposed
the
petition
for
cert
on
other
grounds.
i
did
not
cite
the
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
the
sixth
circuit
joint
appendix
at
page
620.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
well,
my
understanding,
justice
scalia,
is
under
your
rule
26.2
i
am
permitted
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
additional
information
that
was
in
the
joint
appendix
below.
and
that
was
what
i
was
attempting
to
do
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
initial
question
that
started
the
presentation
today.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
solicitor's
brief
at
pages
18
and
19,
the
silver
brief,
the
distinction
between
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2).
(a)(1)
can
be
a
claim
that
just
says,
pay
me;
there's
nothing
false
on
its
face,
but
it
is
impliedly
false
because
it...
it's
not
entitled
to
be
paid
because
the
requirements
haven't
been
met.
(a)(2)
would
require
a
specific
false
statement
in
that
record
or
statement
that's
used.
mr.
james
b.
helmer,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
