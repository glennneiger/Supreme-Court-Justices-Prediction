mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
same
point
that
mr.
olson
began
with,
namely,
does
the
false
claims
act...
is
the
false
claims
act
directed
solely
at
schemes
to
defraud
the
government
or
does
it
encompass
schemes
to
defraud
people
who
receive
federal
money?
and
we're
in
agreement
with
petitioners
that
the
false
claims
act
is
directed
at
schemes
to
defraud
the
federal
government.
our
theory
in
this
case
is
not
that
the
subcontractors
are
potentially
liable
because
they
may
have
attempted
to
defraud
the
prime
contractors.
our
theory
is
that
the
subcontractors
are
potentially
liable
because
they
are
alleged
to
have
used
false
representations
made
to
the
prime
contractors
but
with
the
ultimate
purpose
of
defrauding
the
united
states.
and
i
think
if
you
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
the
allegations
in
this
case
are
true
and
if
the
fraudulent
scheme
had
been
carried
to
completion,
it's
very
clear
that
the
government,
rather
than
the
prime
contractors,
would
have
been
the
injured
party.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
would
say
certainly
in
the
context
where
allison
knows
that
the
engines
are
to
be
used
for
private
work,
that
the
false
claims
act
would
not--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
you
could
still
have
a
fca
claim,
if
in
fact
the
work
was
being
done
for
the
government
contract.
but
whatever
the
correct
answer
to
that
question
in
the
circumstance
where
the
subcontractor
really
doesn't
know
what
the
ultimate
project
is
for,
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
subcontractor--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--our
view
is
that
that
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
would
not
be
covered.
it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
the
statute...
if
you
look
at
page
2
of
the
blue
brief,
that
reproduces
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
statute.
and
the
one
that
we're
principally...
the
two
that
we're
relying
on
here
are
subsection
2,
which
says:
"knowingly
makes,
uses
or
causes
to
be
made
or
used
a
false
record
or
statement
to
get
a
false
or
fraudulent
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government.
"
and
we
would
say
that
the
reference
to
false
or
fraudulent
claim
paid
or
approved
by
the
government
should
be
taken
as
limited
to
a
claim
that
is
false
as
to
the
government.
that
is,
it's
false
in
a
respect
that
the
government
cares
about.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
the
scheme
could
fairly
be
characterized
as
one
to
defraud
the
prime
contractor,
because
the
prime
contractor
would
bear
the
loss
associated
with
the
scheme.
and
we
would
agree
that
that's
not
covered.
here--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
our
test
would
be,
is
the
effect
of
the
fraud
to
cause
the
money
provided
by
the
federal
government
to
be
diverted
to
purposes--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
it
has
basically
worked.
i
don't
think
it
has
worked
perfectly.
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
cases...
i
mean,
medicare
and
medicaid
fraud
is
an
example
that
we
would
deal
with
differently
textually,
but
those
are
programs
in
which
the
federal
government
provides
money.
persons
other
than
federal
officials
decide
whether
the
claims
should
be
paid,
but
ultimately
there's
reimbursement
by
the
federal
government.
now,
our
answer
to
the
question--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
our
view
is
that
those
would
be
covered
even
if
there
is
a
presentment
requirement,
because
subsection
(a)(1)
of
the
statute
refers
to
a
person
who
knowingly
causes
a
false
claim
to
be
presented
to
a
federal
official.
so
because
there's
the
reimbursement
mechanism
we
think
that
would
be
covered.
but
a
big
part
of
our
argument
here
is
that
the
applicability
of
the
fca
should
not
depend
on
these
sorts
of
quirks
of
timing.
that
is,
to
take
the
school
hypothetical
that
was
discussed
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument,
you
have
provision
of
government
money
for...
federal
money
for
construction
of
a
school,
and
the
contractors
who
deal
with
the
state
agency
defraud
the
state
agency
and
they
produce
a
shoddy
product.
now,
if
the
way
that
the
funding
program
works
is
that
the
state
agency
pays
first
and
then
presents
a
claim
for
reimbursement
to
the
federal
government,
that
would
be
covered
even
with
the
presentment
requirement.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
our
answer
would
probably
be
yes.
a
court
might
read
a
de
minimis
limitation
into
the
statute,
but
part
of
our
point
would
be
that
be
that
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
answer
to
that
hypothetical...
and
the
answer
to
that
hypothetical
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
statute
imposes
a
presentment
requirement,
because
the
hypothetical--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
could
be
an
(a)(2)
question,
but
my
point
was
that
the
same
type
of
issue
could
arise
even
with
the
presentment
requirement,
because
if
the
chemical
manufacturer
presents
his
own
bill
to
the
paint
company,
who
presents
his
bill
to
the
contractor
who
does
the
painting
work,
who
presents
his
bill,
et
cetera,
et
cetera--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
i
would
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--again,
whatever...
whatever
the
answer...
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
about
the
timing
is...
again
assume
away
these
issues
about
how
much
might
be
de
minimis.
you
have
substantial
fraud
by
the
contractor
directed
at
the
state
agency.
if
the
state...
if
the
way
the
funding
program
works
is
that
the
state
agency
then
presents
its
own
bill
to
the
federal
government,
we're
going
to
have
a
good
(a)(1)
case
regardless
of
whether
presentment
is
required,
because
we're
going
to
say
the
subcontractor,
the
person
who
did
the
work,
caused
the
state
agency
to
submit
a
false
claim
to
the
federal
government
and
we
can
recover
on
that
theory.
but...
but
if
the
government
provides
the
money
up
front,
gives
it
to
the
state
agency
and
says,
use
it
for
the
defined
purposes,
you'll
still
have
presentment
of
a
claim
by
the
state
agency,
namely
the
request
for
funding,
but
there
will
be
no
way
to
say
that
that
difference--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
point
about
timing...
but
the
point
about
timing
is
if
the
state's
claim
is
submitted
to
the
federal
government
at
a
time
when
the
fraud
has
not
yet
occurred,
the
state's
claim
can't
be
denominated
false,
assuming
that
the
state
intends
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
definition
of
(c)
says
it's
a
request
or
a
demand--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--will
reimburse,
but
it
also
says
"if
the
united
states
government
provides
any
portion
of
the
money
or
property
which
is
requested
or
demanded,
or
if
the
government
will
reimburse.
"
and
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
my...
my
point
is
the
definition
of
"claim"
indicates
that
congress
didn't
want
liability
to
turn
on
this
quirk
of
timing,
whether
the
fraud
occurs
before
the
claim
is
submitted
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there's
liability
if
the
federal
government
reimburses
a
claim
for
expenses
that
have
already
been
incurred,
but
under
petitioner's
theory,
if
the
federal
government
pays
the
money
up
front,
the
state
has
submitted
a
claim
but
it's
not
a
false
claim.
and
then
if
the
contractor
defrauds
the
school...
the
state,
by
producing
a
shoddy
school,
the
contractor
can't
be
charged
with
having
caused
a
false
claim
to
be
submitted.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
our
point
is
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
but
fraud...
fraud
against
the
government
can
occur
whether...
the
whole
point
of
the
definition
of
(c)
is
that
fraud
against
the
government
can
occur
if
federal
money
is
diverted
away
from
its
intended
purposes,
whether
the
deceit
is
practiced
directly
upon
a
federal
official
or
a
contractor
or
a
grantee.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
are
two
principal
limiting
principles.
the
first
is
that
the
bill
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
contractor
or
grantee
in
his
capacity
as
such.
that
is,
there
has
to
be
a
nexus
between
the
provision
of
federal
funds
and
the
request
that's
made.
so
if
a
subcontractor
defrauds
boeing
on
work
that
boeing
is
doing
for
a
private
airline,
there's
no
fca
violation.
even
though
boeing
literally
is
a
government
contractor,
it's
not
being
defrauded
in
its
capacity
as
such.
and
the
second
is
that
the
fraud
has
to
be
of
a
nature
that
if
successfully
carried
to
completion
could
be
expected
to
injure
the
federal
government.
so
in
the
hypothetical
of
the
cost
plus
contract
between
the
prime
contractor
and
the
sub
and
the
sub
presents
an
inflated
bill,
if
the
loss
false
on
the
prime
contractor
and
is
not
passed
along
to
the
government,
the
claim
would
not
lie
under
the
fca--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
would
be
enough.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
still
be
asking
was
the...
whether
the
fraud
was
of
a
sort
that
the
federal
government
cared
about.
that
is,
if
the
federal
government
made
a
grant
with
no
strings
attached,
use
it
as
you
want.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
then
there
would
be
no
fca
liability.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
because
the
fraud
would
not...
in
that...
in
that
hypothetical,
you
would
have
something
akin
to
a
fraudulent
car
repair
bill
passed
along,
given
to
me.
i
happen
to
be
a
department
of
justice
employee
and
i
might
use
my
federal
salary
to
pay
the
fraudulent
claim.
but
we
wouldn't
say
that's
an
fca
violation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
would
still
ask
whether
the
government
has...
the
federal
government
has
placed
meaningful
limitations
on
the
way
in
which
the
money
may
be
spent
and
whether
the
nature
of
the
fraud
is
to
prevent
those
limitations
from
being
honored.
thank
you.
