i
am
somewhat
puzzled.
how
many
bad
actors
does
there
have
to
be
before
you
can
draw
an
inference
that
someone
superior
to
the
bad
actors
had
a
motivating
part
in
the
whole
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this,
though.
does
it
show
whether
the
person
more
senior
to
the
five
supervisors
involved
here
was
the
same
person
or
a
different
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
we
said
that
404
applies
to
corporations?
corporations
have
a
character?
