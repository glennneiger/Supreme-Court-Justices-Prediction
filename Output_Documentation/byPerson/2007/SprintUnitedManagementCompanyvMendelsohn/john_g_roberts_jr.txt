chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
06-1221,
sprint/united
management
company
v.
mendelsohn.
mr.
cane.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
that
it
has
to
be
a
case-by-case
determination?
there's
no
absolute
rule
either
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
assume
it
would
be
addressed
as
it
was
here,
in
a
motion
in
limine,
the
plaintiff
would
say
here
are
the
witnesses
we
intend
to
call;
the
company
would
say
we
don't
think
they're
relevant
because,
as
you
say,
there's
no
connection
between
them,
and
then
the
judge
would
decide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
on
the
issue
of
relevance.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
that
be
done
typically
at
the
motion
in
limine
stage?
i
mean,
do
you
establish
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination
in
the
"me,
too"
cases
at
trial
or
prior
to
the
trial,
outside
the
jury's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about
the
spreadsheet
evidence?
i
thought
there
was
some
effort
to
show
a
connection
through
the
spreadsheet
showing
the
age
of
the
dismissed
employees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
theory
doesn't
depend
on
where
in
the
hierarchy
the
other
supervisors
are
located,
i
take
it,
if
there's
a
connection?
in
other
words,
if
there's
a
lower-level
supervisor
who
discriminates
and
that
is
somehow
communicated
to
the
supervisor
in
question,
and
whatever...
that
you
know,
the
point
is
that
the
other
one
wasn't
disciplined
or
something,
that
would
still...
under
your
theory
that
would
be
admissible,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i'm
talking
about
a
situation...
let's
say
it
is
a
lower-level
supervisor
outside
the
chain
of
command
who
commits
another
"me,
too"
act,
but
that
is
communicated
to
the
other
in
a
way
that
suggests,
for
example,
that
the
company
tolerates
it
or
accepts
it.
i
take
it
that
that
would
be
potentially
admissible
subject
to
403
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cane.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
under...
under
401,
it's
not
always
admissible,
or
do
you
need
403
to
reach
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
do
you
think
there
are
situations
where
other-supervisor
evidence
is
not
admissible
under
401
itself?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
determination
of
the
relevance
of
the
403
status...
needs
to
be
made
at
the
motion
in
limine
stage,
or
is
it
a
question
for
the
jury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it's...
if
on
the
"me,
too"
evidence
it's
a
"he
said/she
said"
type
of
case,
does
that
get
admitted
to
the
jury?
or
is
that
excluded
at
the
motion
in
limine
stage?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they're
only...
it
is
only
relevant,
of
course,
if
it
is
true;
and
if
the
company
denies
that
the
"me,
too"
episode
even
took
place,
don't
you
have
to
have
a
separate
trial
on
that
before
you
can
determine
whether
it's
even
admissible?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
get
back
to
my...
the
predicate
to
my
question.
it's
only
relevant
if
it
happened.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
seems
to
me
we've
had
a
lot
of
discussion
whether
it
is
relevant
if
it
happened,
but
we
don't
know
how
we
determine
whether
it
happened
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
an
allegation...
an
allegation
of
discrimination
in
a
"me,
too"
context
is
automatically
relevant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
garre.
mr.
egan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
if
you
have
a
situation
that's
been
referred
to
earlier,
where
you
have
four
other
supervisors
that
are
presented
as
"me,
too"
evidence.
they
are
in
the
los
angeles
office.
the
defendant's
supervisor
is
in
the
fresno
office.
is
that
evidence
relevant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
just
that
they...
they
are
alleged
to
have
fired
people
for
an
impermissible
basis
under
the
age
discrimination
act
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right,
let's
take
it
and
say
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
doesn't
that
beg
the
question?
we
don't
know.
this
isn't
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
you
don't
have
evidence
of
a
company-wide
policy
of
discrimination.
take
my
hypothetical.
there
are
just
four
people
who
are
alleged
to
harbor
age-based
bias,
and
they...
in
the
los
angeles
office.
no
connection
to
the
fresno
supervisor
at
all,
other
than
that
they
work
for
the
same
company.
is
that
enough
for
relevance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
might
not
be
relevant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
404.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
these
episodes
that
were
necessarily
communicated
to
the
supervisor
at
issue
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
make
the...
you
don't
suggest
that
he
was
even
aware
of
these
other
anecdotes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
conceding
that
we
don't
even
know
that
that
comment
was
communicated
in
any
way
to
the
supervisor
at
issue
here.
he
may
not
have
been
aware
of
it.
the
supervisor...
he
may
have
been
in
fresno
and
that
supervisor
in
los
angeles.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
assume
there's
no
dispute
over
any
direct
evidence
you
have
that
the
supervisor
was
being
guided
by
a
company
policy
or
statement
or
the
rif
program
that
was
discriminatory.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
you
can
bring
in
testimony
that...
which
has
no
demonstrated
connection
to
the
supervisor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
happens
in
this
case?
let's
say
there
are
five
"me,
too"
situations
presented,
and
the
court
make
a
determination
in
each
one,
and
the
jury
finds
for
the
plaintiff.
and
then
it's
appealed,
and
the
argument
on
appeal
is,
well,
in
three
of
those
five
cases
there
wasn't
age
discrimination
and
here's
why.
and
that
evidence
is...
well
then
the
court
of
appeals
agrees,
yes,
those
three
cases
shouldn't
have
been
admitted.
is
that
reversible
error?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
under
my
hypothetical,
in
the
three
cases,
the
court
of
appeals,
let's
say,
determines
that
the
alleged
statements
did
not
occur.
that's
the
argument.
and
this
was
admitted
to
the
jury
in
three
of
the
five
cases,
and
those
statements
did
not
occur.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
reversible
error
on
appeal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
five
gets
you
cases
when
the
court
of
appeals
determines
that
three
did
not
occur?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
i
assume
your
rule
cuts
the
other
way?
let's
say
in
this
company
of
70,000
or
17,000,
or
whatever
it
is,
there
are
a
thousand
supervisors.
four
or
five
are
alleged
to
have
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
age.
i
assume
the
company
can
call
the
other
995
and
say:
are
there
any
allegations
against
you?
did
you
fire
people?
and
did
you
in
some
cases
keep
the
oldest
one?
and
then
they
have
to...
you
know,
they
say
yes.
so
the,
"me,
too"
evidence
works
both
ways,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you
are
talking
about
culture,
what
is
the
culture
of
the
company
if
995
supervisors
don't
supervise...
don't
discriminate
in
their
decisions
and
5
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
company
can
admit
evidence
to
show
the
opposite
of
your
"me,
too"
evidence
by
other
supervisors
and
you
say
five
shows
the
culture
of
discrimination,
how
many
are
they
allowed
to
admit
before...
to
show
the
opposite
culture?
certainly
more
than
five
if
they
say
this
isn't
representative.
you
have
to
look
at
these
15
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
there
are
15,
30,
or
however
many
is
equally
relevant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
as
well
in
ruling
that
the
evidence
was
admissible?
because
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
souter,
it
is
that
there
should
be
a
403
evaluation
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
allow
the
district
court
to
undertake
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
on
the
remand
that
you
conceded
is
necessary,
that
will
take
place
in
the
context
of
a
motion
in
limine
and
not
in
the
context
of
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
a
new
trial
is
required
for
the
district
court
to
make
the
403
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
egan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cane,
you
have
five
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cane.
the
case
is
submitted.
