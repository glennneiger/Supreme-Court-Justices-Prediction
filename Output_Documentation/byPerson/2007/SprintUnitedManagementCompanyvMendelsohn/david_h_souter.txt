justice
david
h.
souter
well,
to
the
extent
it
was
grounded
on
401,
it
was
error,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
have
three
supervisors,
and
one
is
discriminating
and
another
is
discriminating,
isn't
that
some
evidence
that
you're
in
an
industrial
situation
in
which
discrimination
goes
on,
and
therefore
doesn't
it
have
the
tendency
that
amounts
to
relevance
under
401?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
no
relevance
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
my
question?
we
have
evidence
that
there
are
three
supervisors,
two
of
them
are
discriminating.
isn't
that
some...
doesn't
that
have
some
tendency
to
indicate
that
in
an
equivocal
situation,
that
one
was...
it
may
not
be
strong
evidence,
it
may
not
win
the
case,
it
may
not
be
powerful,
but
it
has
the
tendency
that
gets
you
over
the
line
on
401,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
want
to...
i
don't
want
to
emphasize
my
question,
before
we
get
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
you've
got
20
supervisors
and
you've
got
evidence
that
19
of
them
have
discriminated
after
making
expressly
discriminatory
remarks.
the
20th
is
the
subject
to
the
action.
is
the
evidence
of
the
19
admissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
a
nexus
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
so,
if
we've
got
19
and
there's
a
question
of
1,
we've
got
a
nexus.
if
we've
got
three
and
there's
a
question,
two
are
accounted
for
as
discriminatory,
and
the
question
is
the
third,
we
don't
have
a
nexus.
is
that
the
way
you're
doing
the
math?
justice
david
h.
souter
at
this
point,
i'm
saying
three
supervisors
out
of
a
whole
company.
will
that
do
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
three
supervisors,
and
that's
all
there
is
in
the
company.
that
consists
of
the
company.
have
a
nexus
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
do
we
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
to
elaborate
on
that
somewhat?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
went
through
to
kind
of
pin
down
what
the
facts
of
consequence
were.
i
went
through
the
offer
of
proof.
i
don't
have
my
notes
in
front
of
me,
but
i
think
my
recollection
is
right
on
this.
it
struck
me
that
the
admissible
evidence
that
was
indicated
by
the
offer
of
proof
boils
down
basically
to
this:
there
were
three
employees
who
would
testify
that,
following
their
dismissal,
some
or
all
of
their
work
was
done
by
a
younger
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
one
employee
who
would
testify
that
he
received...
she
saw
a
spreadsheet
in
front
of
one
supervisor
that
indicated
age.
there
was
one
employee
who
would
testify
that
her
immediate
supervisor
had
made
age-discriminatory
remarks.
and
another
employee
would
testify
that
her
supervisor's
boss
had
made
age-discriminatory
remarks.
now,
basically,
out
of
this
company
of
70,000,
that
seems
to
be
the
sum
total
of
the...
the
kind
of
circumstantial
evidence
of
culture
that
you
presented
in
the
offer
of
proof.
am
i
selling
your
offer
of
proof
short
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
testimony
at
least
shows
these
points
that
you
and
i
agreed
the
offer
of
proof
offers
to
prove.
they're
going
to
be
met...
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
suppose,
they're
going
to
be
met
by
counter-evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
going
to
have
litigation
on
these
points,
and
they're
going
to
take...
in
effect,
become
subsidiary
chapters
in
this
trial.
and
what
concerns
me,
i
guess,
is
that,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's...
it
strikes
me
as
though
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
proof
itself
is
not
going
to
be
anything
close
to
overwhelming.
we
will
have
had
a
potentially
confusing
trial
on
this
subsidiary
third-party
evidence.
and
we
seem
to
be
very
close,
if
we
have
not
gotten
over
the
line,
of
the
subsidiary
evidence,
in
effect,
being
substantially
misleading
or
prejudicial.
and...
and
basically
i'm
raising
a
question
of
weight
under
403.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
get
to
the
point,
though,
hasn't
the
last
hour
of
questioning
from
the
court
shown
that
what
we
really
ought
to
take
place
here
is
a
remand
to
the
trial
court
for
a
403
balance?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
