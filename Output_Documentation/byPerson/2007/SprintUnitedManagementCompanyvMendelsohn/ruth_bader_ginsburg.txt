bader

what
do
you
mean
by
that?
you
repeated
several
times
there
must
be...
must
lay
a
foundation.
you
do
recognize,
i
think
in
your
reply
brief,
that
some
other
supervisor
evidence
would
be
relevant
and
admissible,
but
you
refer
to
the
foundation.
tell
us
what
you
think
a
proper
foundation
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
mean
by
"nexus"?
if
they
both
work
in
the
same
physical
facility,
is
that
a
nexus?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
didn't
the
tenth
circuit
read
it
to
be
an
absolute
prohibition?
that
it
must
be
the
same
supervisor?
""similarly
situated"
requires
proof
that
paul
reddick
was
the
decisionmaker.
"
that
seems
as
though
that
the
district
court
thought
there...
it
must
be
the
same
supervisor,
and
i
thought
that's
how
the
tenth
circuit
read--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
didn't
present
the
other
supervisor,
which
i
think
is
more...
a
better
way
to
comprehend
this,
because
10
witnesses
working
under
the
same
supervisor.
but
these
two
people,
as
i
understand
it,
were
in
the
direct
chain
of
supervisory
command.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
"other
supervisor".
they
are
both
supervisors
of
this
employee.
she's
in
a
unit
that
includes
both
superior
officers.
i
thought
that
the
issue
here
was
simply
other
supervisors,
witnesses
who
had
worked
for
other
supervisors,
people
for
whom
the...
with
whom
the
plaintiff
had
no
connection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say...
i
thought
you
said
in
your
reply
brief
that
other-supervisor
evidence
could
be
relevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
lay
a
foundation.
and
that's
the
difference
between
you,
i
thought...
with
respect
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
your
brief
takes
the
position
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
lay
a
foundation
in
order
to
introduce
other-supervisor
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
reason
the
tenth
circuit
thought
that
the
district
court
was
ruling
under
401,
making
a
relevance
determination,
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
precedent
in
the
area
of
employee
discipline,
and
the
tenth
circuit
said
well,
the
district
court
was
following
that
precedent,
but
that
precedent
doesn't
apply
in
this
situation.
so
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
understand
it,
read
the
district
court
as
just
applying
an
absolute
ban.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
they
said
that
it
should
be
admitted.
i
thought
they
went
to
the
opposite
extreme.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the...
how
can
we
make
that
assumption
when
the
tenth
circuit
says
we
know
why
this
district
judge
ruled
as
he
or
she
did?
we
had
a
precedent.
it...
it
dealt
with
employee
discipline.
we
said,
categorically,
it's
got
to
be
the
same
supervisor;
otherwise
it's
not
relevant.
the
district
judge
was
simply
applying
that
case
to
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wasn't
any
403
question.
it
was
this
doesn't
some
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not...
the
point
is
that
the
tenth
circuit
said
this
judge
made
an
absolute
rule:
it
doesn't
come
in.
we
know
why
he
made
an
absolute
rule;
that
was
our
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
not
think
that
there
is
an
important
value
that
the
tenth
circuit
recognized
in
making
it
clear
that
there
is
no
absolute
bar?
if
we
just
assume
in
favor
of
the
district
court,
when
we
don't
know
that
the
district
court
didn't
take
it
as
an
absolute
rule,
that...
this
is
a
point
of
law
that
should
be
clarified
for
the
benefit
of
district
courts.
either
there's
a
categorical
bar
or
there's
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
government
said
it
was
not
necessary
to
lay
a
foundation.
mr.
garre
confirmed
that
point.
