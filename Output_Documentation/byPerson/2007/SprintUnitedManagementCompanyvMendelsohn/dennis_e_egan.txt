mr.
dennis
e.
egan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
we'll
turn
to
3a
in
the
white
book,
the
court
of
appeals
properly
understood
that
this
was
a
blanket
order
based
on
only
one
fact.
if
you
weren't
supervised
by
paul
reddick,
it
was
not
admissible.
at
page
2a,
the
court
said
prior
to
trial,
sprint
filed
a
motion
in
limine
seeking
to
exclude
among
other
things
any
evidence
of
sprint's
alleged
discriminatory
treatment
of
other
employees.
relying
exclusively
on
aramburu,
sprint
argued
that
any
reference
to
alleged
discrimination
by
any
supervisor
other
than
reddick...
it
was
irrelevant.
throughout...
and
let
me
mention
here,
your
honor,
that
the
order
of
things
was
not
as
mr.
cane
got
it.
he
said
the
order
was
grounded
on
an
offer
of
proof.
if
i
may
address
the
chronology,
on
december
15,
2004,
sprint
filed
its
motion
saying
that
if...
it
is
not
the
same
supervisor,
it
doesn't
come
in.
there's
no
mention,
ever,
about
the
facts
of
the
proffer.
never.
it
never
came
up
below.
we--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--it
depends
what
the
evidence
is
and
what
it
is
tied
to,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
in
your
hypothetical
was
it
was
during
the
same
common
employer
initiated
action,
such
as
a
reduction
in
force?
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
okay.
what
the
court
of
appeals
noted
here
was
that
in
this
case
it
makes
a
difference
that
we're
talking
about
a
common
employer-initiated
event.
we're
not
talking
about--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--if
there
is
no
connection,
it
might
not
be,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
might
not
be
relevant.
let
me
say
that--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor,
because
the
standard
arises
out
of
article
iv,
which
is
entitled
"relevancy
and
its
limits".
there
are
no
categorical
bars
within
article
iv
except
when...
congress
and
the
court
have
mentioned,
401
has
no
categorical
bar.
the
test
is,
does
a
fact
have...
if
evidence
has
any
tendency
to
make
a
fact
of
consequence
more
likely
than
without
it?
so
it
depends.
in
rule
401,
there
is
no
categorical
bar.
in
article
iv,
if
there
are
areas
where
there
are
problems,
we
list
them.
407,
411...
no
mention
of
liability
insurance.
410.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
404(b),
your
honor.
and
in
this
case
the
lower
courts
had
used
404.
we
did
not
address
it.
i
don't
think
anybody
really
did
in
a
brief,
other
than
the
government
mentioned
the
huddlestone
case.
the
huddlestone
case
is
important
because
it
said
that
there
is
no
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
something
is
relevant.
what
you
do
is
the
court
looks
at
all
the
evidence.
the
evidence
that
ellen
mendelsohn
wanted
to
offer
has
connections
to
it.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
your
honor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
what
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
the
court
did,
because
what
the
court
did
was
it
ruled
on
what
they
presented,
which
was
not
anything
having
to
do
with
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
confusion
of
issues.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate.
and
the
court
of
appeals
quoted
its
own
law
that
says
we
are
in
no
position
to
speculate.
as
a
superintending
court,
they
ruled
only
one
thing...
a
categorical
bar
of
evidence
that
was
before
it,
and
they
said
that's
wrong.
you
followed
the
wrong
case
law.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
i'm
not
sure
that
they
went
to
that
extreme.
their
language
is
this,
your
honor:
they
say,
"based
on
what
we
see"...
and
they
have
the
proffer
in
front
of
them
at
that
time,
and
they
also
have
the
full
transcript,
which
hasn't
been
talked
about...
how
ellen
mendelsohn's
case
and
her
theory
tied
into
these
people.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
your
honor,
in
several
different
ways.
barred
evidence
of
culture.
we
had
evidence
of
culture
from
open
remarks,
that
someone
needs
to
be
"blessed
with
lots
of
runway
ahead
of
them.
"
in
order
to
get
a
good
rating.
bonnie
hoopes
said
being
told
she
was
too
old
for
the
job
right
after
she
received
that
memo,
being
told
openly
and
repeatedly,
"i'm
too
old
for
the
job.
"
if
there
are
too
many--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--no,
your
honor,
but
this
is
on
the
question
of
culture.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
we
do
not
suggest,
but
what
we
say
is
that
what
was
going
on
in
the
culture...
you've
got
a
supervisor
like
ted
stock,
openly
saying,
"i
can't
wait
for
rif's,
so
that
i
can
get
rid
of
the
older
people
in
my
department.
"
that
supervisor's
conclusion
is
that
it's
okay.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
your
honor,
what
way
do
know
is
that
they
attended
the
same
meetings,
the
key
leadership
meetings,
that
took
place
in
january
2002
that
covered
something
very
important
to
our
case...
the
establishment
of
a
forced
ranking
system
and
also
a
discussion
of
the
rif's
that
are
ongoing
and
continuing.
they're
at
the
same
meeting.
it's
after
this
meeting,
where
jack
welch
is
presented
to
the
group,
that
they
come
out
with
the
philosophy
of
forced--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
the
rules
of
evidence
simply
talk
in
terms
of
"not
demonstrate
a
connection".
it
doesn't
exist.
if
we
look
at
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
standard...
and
the
standard
we
believe
applies
here...
is
a
two-step
methodology.
it
would
be,
number
one,
what
is
the
party...
the
thing
the
party
is
trying
to
prove,
such
as
culture...
is
that
a
subsidiary
fact
of
consequence?
something
that's
been
missed
in
the
petitioner's
position
and
even
in
the
district
court,
is
that
rule
401
says
that
you
have
three
levels
of
evidence.
the
ultimate
issue,
and
the
petitioner
has
always
said
this
doesn't
prove
that
reddick
discriminated
against
mendelsohn.
that's
the
ultimate
issue.
we
have
many
intermediary
facts
to
which
the
evidence
relates.
they
are
facts
of
consequence,
and
the
evidence
had
a
tendency
to
show
these
facts
of
consequence.
so
that--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
sir.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
no,
you
are
not,
your
honor.
the...
you
have
hit
it
precisely.
and
we
believe
that
with
culture,
it's
the
openness
of
what's
going
on.
the
openness.
the
number
of
events
goes
to
weight.
all
the
weaknesses
and
frailties
of
the
evidence
go
to
weight.
and
we
never
got
to
that
portion
of
determining
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
the
weight--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--thank
you,
your
honor.
the...
this
ties
in,
in
several
different
ways,
if
i
can
take
them
all,
to
culture,
to
modus
operandi,
and
this
wouldn't
require
discriminatory
conduct.
for
instance,
the
story
line
that
jobs
have
been
abolished
and
given
to
youngers.
that's
where
that
would
be
modus
operandi.
the
fact
that
the
office
shadow
rating
system...
they're
under
the
same
rating
system
that's
not
supposed
to
apply
to
employees
like
ellen
mendelsohn
and
those
who
we
are
presenting,
but
it
was--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--one
of
these
three
what,
your
honor?
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
it
depends
what
it's
offered
for
because
relevance
does--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--if
it's
culture--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--and
the
ceo
is
saying
that
we
want
to
bring
the
average
age
down...
which
never
happens...
but
under--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--well,
if
they're
just
accused,
no,
your
honor.
the
assumption
has
to
be--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
we
have
not
even
addressed
at
any
time
the
content
of
the
decision...
i
mean
the
content
of
the
testimony.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
my
response,
because
i'm
hearing
you
talk
about
the
mini-trial
issues,
first
of
all,
as
you
know,
it
will
not
happen
here.
we
had
a
pretrial
january
29,
2007,
after...
before
sprint
had
filed
its
petition
for
cert,
in
which
we
discussed
will
this
be
a
longer
trial.
one
and
a
half,
maybe
two
days.
the
fact
of
mini-trials,
your
honor,
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
often.
you
can
try
joinder
cases.
i've
tried
joinder
cases
with
eight
plaintiffs,
and
you
handle
that
with
instructions.
the
answer
isn't
to
keep
out
possibly
probative
evidence;
the
answer
is
to
let--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--to
let
sprint
put
on
counter-evidence--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
i
think
that
what
you
handle
that
with
is
limiting
instructions.
it
would
be
the
evidence
of
acts
or
statements
of
anyone
else
that
you've
heard
are
relevant
only
to
the
intent
of
paul
reddick.
nobody
would
contend
that
bonnie
hoopes
was--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--at
least
that's
part
of
our
adversary
system,
your
honor,
where
we
have
both
sides
presenting
and
countering.
the
super--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--that
it--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--if
it's
determined
under
your
hypothetical--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
your
honor.
that
requires,
under
403
requires,
a
balancing.
and
i
think
you
must
have,
contrary
to
what...
all
due
respect...
justice
scalia
suggested,
rule
403
is
the
only
rule
that
expressly
says
"substantially
outweighs".
we
have
no
evidence
here--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
your
honor.
is
that
a
problem,
and
why
is
it
an
evidentiary
exclusion
before
trial?
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
and
so
once
you
are
there,
we
have
no
quarrel
if
the
tenth
circuit...
and
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
leaves
room
for
sending
it
back,
remand
it,
and
then
the
court
could
still
make
rulings,
as
the
tenth
circuit
said,
on
cumulative
nature
of
evidence,
hearsay
objections.
these
haven't
been
addressed.
sprint
has
been--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i'm
not
understanding--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
our...
we
believe
that
it
does.
because
the
evidence
has
a
tendency
to
make
more
probable
than
without
the
evidence
facts
of
consequence,
on
culture,
on
impeachment,
on
pattern,
on
pretext.
that's
our
standard.
we
have
no
indication
here
that
the
judge
ever
engaged
in
a
balancing...
none.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
if
you
believe
that
it
is
so
clear,
then,
of
course,
that
would
be...
if
you
believe
that
it
is
so
clear
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
exclude
it,
then
that
is
the
prerogative
of
the
court
to
do.
but
it
must
be
done
under
this
standard,
your
honor;
that
is,
the
judge
looks
at
the
evidence
and
asks
the
question
like
he
would
for
submissibility.
what
would
a
reasonable
jury
say,
and
is
there
room
for
disagreement?
if
you
have
federal
judges,
for
instance,
who
disagree
on
admissibility--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--i
understand,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--but
let
me
just
say
this,
if
i
might.
discrimination
cases
are
important.
in
the
mckennon
case
justice
kennedy
wrote
for
the
unanimous
court
in
saying
every
time
a
single
plaintiff
advances
the
cause
and
prevails
in
a
discrimination
case,
it
serves
the
national
public
purpose.
so
it's
important.
and
the
idea
of
there
being
cases
on
this,
the
court
house
doors
should
be
open.
the
decision
may
be...
may
be--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--absolutely.
and
that
is
important,
because
in
your
court,
cases
and
jurisprudence--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
the
culture...
they
have
the
right
to
bring
on
evidence,
but
the
trial
court
retains
the
discretion.
and
i
hope
this
answers
justice
breyer's
question,
also.
the
court
retains
the
discretion
to
keep
out
marginal
evidence.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
because
john
borel's
evidence
goes
to
pretext,
your
honor.
and
pretext
under
the
reeves
case
is
something
that
is
highly,
highly
important,
and
highly
important
to
the
trial
lawyer.
his
pretext
evidence
is
twofold.
he
was
going
to
get
a
job
before
he
knew
that
he
was
riffed.
he
goes
to
apply
for
the
job
after
the
rif,
and
he
is
told:
sorry,
you've
got
a
secret
adverse
rating.
now,
mind
you,
the
company
says:
we
don't
use
these
ratings.
now,
in
ellen
mendelsohn's
trial
without
corroboration,
she's
isolated.
that's
john
borel's
important
testimony
in
this
case.
john
hoopes...
he's
told
by
a
vice
president
why
can't
you
hire
someone
younger?
why
would
you
hire
someone
age
48,
which
indicates
that
at
sprint,
it's
something
that
is
determined
to
be
okay.
so
that's--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--i
can't
pick
a
number,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we're
not
saying
that
the
five
proves
the
fact
as
you
said
of
proving
culture.
but
it
is
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
it.
a
reasonable
juror--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
that
was
after
the
premise
that
the
testimony
would
not
be
admitted.
but,
your
honor,
this
was
after
remand.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
no,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
what
happened
here
was
the
remand
or
the
reversal
came
down.
we
have
a
pretrial
because
we're
going
back
to
trial.
we
have
a
trial
on
january
29,
2007.
excuse
me.
a
pretrial,
and
at
that
trial
the
court
asked
well,
will
this
be
a
long
trial,
four
weeks,
five
weeks?
we
say
if
you
open
up
discovery,
if
they
want
to
bring
people
to
refute...
sprint
said
no.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
well,
your
honor,
it
goes
to
whether
or
not
saying
that
there's
going
to
be
a
lengthy
trial
it
is
some
evidence
as
you
look
at
what
the
actual
experience
is...
look
at
the
cases
cited
by
the
defendant.
we
cited
them
in
our
brief.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
that's
fine,
your
honor.
but
they
should
be
not
take
out
the
legs
from
the
plaintiffs
to
try
to
prove
their
case.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
your
honor,
we're
simply
asking
for
balance,
because
other
supervisors--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
if
i
might
offer
some
concluding
thoughts
because
my
time
is
running
down.
the
district
court
erred
in
categorically
barring
all
other
supervisor
evidence.
it
was
a
categorical
bar.
when
you
get
into
the
chronology
of
what
happened,
you
will
see
no
indication
otherwise.
neither
rule
401
nor
rule
403
support
such
a
blanket
prohibition.
as
i
mentioned
under
rule
401--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--your
honor,
i
think
that
what
the...
my
reading
of
the
tenth
circuit,
for
what
it's
worth,
is
that
they
were
looking
at
the
exclusionary
order
based
on
the
wrong
legal
rule
and
said,
we
are
going
to
reverse
that.
and
that
we
see
nothing
that
indicates
that
the
evidence
is
overly
prejudicial,
since
that's
basically
all
that
they
were
looking
at.
there
could
be,
and
we
assume
there
would
be,
new
motions
filed
upon
remand,
in
which
case
we'll
answer
anything
going
to
the
merits
because
we've
never
been
allowed
to
talk
about
the
content
of
the
testimony
itself.
will
it
be
cumulative?
is
it
overly
prejudicial?
we've
got--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--it
should
be
in
the
context
of
going
back
and
being
remanded,
for
the
court
maybe
to
make
determination,
but
our
position
is
in
the
context
of
a
new
trial
the
court
can
address
any
new
motion
that
hasn't
been
made.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
i
think
that
you
have
to
get
back
before
the
district
court
procedurally.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
no,
your
honor,
you
haven't
said
that
they
should
be
on
the
record,
but
we're
not
asking
for
that.
we're
asking
for
some
indication
of
what--
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
--well,
your
honor,
there
should...
we
believe,
if...
as
you
write
the
opinion,
there
should
be...
the
court
should
show
there
work.
you
know,
it's...
as
i
was
taught
in
grade
school,
you
your
work
so
that
we
know
what
you
did
rule
on.
they
should
follow
the
rules
as
well.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
no,
your
honor,
if
may
i
answer
that
question.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
the
only
thing
that
can't
happen
on
remand...
i
want
to
make
sure
this
is
clear...
is
that
the
judge
can't
exclude
on
the
same
basis
that
caused
the
problem
the
first
time;
that
is,
well,
it
is
not
reddick;
it's
excluded.
not
reddick,
it's
excluded.
any
other
factors
would
be
open.
mr.
dennis
e.
egan
thank
you.
