justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
were
to
read
the
district
court's
minute
order...
and
this
is
that
short
minute
order...
as
saying
that
evidence
of
pattern
and
practice
simply
is
not
admissible,
that
would
be
error,
would
it
not?
error
to...
if
the...
if
that
had
been
his
ruling,
that
would
have
been
error.
in
my
court,
you
don't
introduce
pattern
and
practice.
that
can't
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
there
anything
in
the
other
parts
of
the
record
colloquy,
comments
by
the
district
judge,
that
you
think
respondents
have
called
to
our
attention
to
indicate
that
he
had
this
sweeping
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
did
i
hear
mishear
you?
you
said
it's
a
7,000-person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
mention
the
offer
of
proof.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
an
attempt
by
the
plaintiff
during
the
discovery
phase
of
the
case
to
show
other
evidence
of
pattern
and
practice,
statistical
evidence;
or
was
it
just
these
five
people?
was
that
all
that
the
plaintiff
presented?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
inference
they
are
trying
to
prove
is
there
was
somebody
upstairs
that
told
everybody
what
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
record
show
in
this
70,000-person
company
how
many
supervisors
there
were?
do
we
know
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
next
step
up
would
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
see
your...
does
404
bear
on
the
case,
rule
404
of
the
rules
of
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
those
supervisors
riffed
two
thousands
employees,
and
only
three
made
this
complaint?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
matter
how
many
employees
were
riffed,
only
three
supervisors...
hypothetical
case,
three
supervisors.
no
many
how
many
employees
were
riffed,
the
three
is
sufficient
so
that
these
witnesses
could
testify?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
take
it
in
this
case,
and
in
all
cases,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
laying
the
foundation
for
this
evidence;
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
the
foundation
is
satisfied
if
they
were
the
same
supervisors
in
the
same
division,
i
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
write
that
in
a
case
as
a
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
without
reference
to
how
many
employees
were
involved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
there
was
going
to
be
an
agreement
that
this
would
be
a
trial
or
a
day,
a
day
and
a
half.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
before
or
after
the
premise
this
testimony
would
not
be
admitted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
told
it
can
be
done
in
a
day
and
a
half.
because
these
five
were
excluded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
ruling
that
the
trial
judge
made
that's
under
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
and
that
we're
looking
at
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
this
court
said
that
403
determinations
must
always
be
made
on
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
that's
precisely
what
you
are
saying,
that
that
there
is
no
balancing
shown,
that
he
didn't
do
the
balance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
there
were
two
points
about
403.
