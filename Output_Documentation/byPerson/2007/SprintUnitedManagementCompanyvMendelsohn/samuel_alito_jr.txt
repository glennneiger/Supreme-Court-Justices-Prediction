justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
don't
we
have
to
address
403
in
any
event?
because
the
tenth
circuit
ruled,
as
i
understand
it,
ruled
that
the
evidence
could
not
be
excluded
under
403.
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
the
trial
judge
to
have
excluded
it
under
403.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
you
articulate
the
rule
that
separates
these
situations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
the
relevant
factors,
but
what
do
you
look
at
the
factors
to
determine...
what's
the
test
for
determining
whether
they
are
sufficient?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well
suppose
you're...
if
you're
right
on
401
and
402,
would...
do
we
not
still
have
to
go
on
and
decide
whether
it
would
have
been
a
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
to
exclude
this
under
403?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
find
that
it
would
not
have
been
abuse
of
discretion,
then
how
could
we
affirm
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
maybe,
just
as
an
example,
you
could
take
mr.
borel
and
mr.
hoopes
and
explain
why
their
testimony
should
not
have
been
excluded
under
403?
as
i
read
trent,
the
only
thing
i
have
as
to
either
one
of
them
is
that
they
were
replaced
by
young
women
in
their
position.
that's
it
as
far
as
admissible
evidence
for
either
one.
now,
if
you
do
that,
the
403
balancing
there,
why
doesn't
that
lead
to
exclusion?
