justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
the
way
to
do
it,
you
didn't
do
it
that
way,
did
you?
i
mean,
as
i
read
it...
they
put
in
here,
on
163a,
the
motion
that
you
made
to
the
district
court
said
that
you
have
to
be
"similarly
situated"...
"plaintiff
has
to
have
been
"similarly
situated"
with
other
employees.
"
--and
you
put
that
in
quotes...
"similarly
situated".
and
then
you
say
"employees
may
be
"similarly
situated"
only
if
they
have
the
same
supervisor.
"
period.
not...
it
wasn't
a
period
actually,
but
the
rest
of
the
sentence
isn't
important.
and
then
you
cite
aramburu,
which
is
where
the
tenth
circuit
said
that.
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
this
wasn't
a
401
case.
you
were
saying
that
weren't
similarly
situated,
period.
and
then
the
district
judge
virtually
quoted
those
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be,
but
the...
i
don't
see...
i
mean,
that
may
be,
but
this
is
the
argument
you
made,
and
this
was
the
argument
the
district
judge
adopted.
is
that
not
so
or
is
it
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
i'm
confused
here.
what
i
said,
and
you
seemed
to
agree,
is
different
from
what
was
just
said,
which
you
also
seemed
to
agree.
[laughter]
i
thought
that
you
said
in
your
brief
that
you
have
to
have
been...
quote...
"similarly
situated".
all
right?
"employees
must
be
similarly
situated
to
plaintiff.
"
that's
true,
isn't
it?
i'm
quoting
the
brief,
from
page
163.
and
then
you
say,
"employees
may
be
similarly
situated
only
if
they
have
the
same
supervisor.
"
then
the
district
court
says
that
plaintiff
may
offer
evidence
who
are
"similarly
situated"
to
her
and
then...
quote...
"similarly
situated
employees"...
quote...
"for
the
purpose
of
this
ruling
requires
proof
that
paul
reddick,
his
supervisor,
was
the
decisionmaker.
"
that's
why
i
thought
it
was
fairly
clear,
since
he
used
the
same
words
and
substituted
the
word
"paul
reddick"
for
the
same
supervisor,
that
he
was
taking
that
right
from
your
brief
where
you
made
that
general
argument
and
said
nothing
about
the
particular
case
in
those
sentences.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
should
we
do
then?
sorry.
go
ahead
and
conclude.
but
i
want
to
ask
this
after
you
finish
answering
justice
souter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
finish
your
answer
to
justice
souter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
exactly
what's
sort
of
bothering
me.
you
are
the
trial
lawyer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
not.
and
what's
worrying
me
most
about
this
is
i
will
say
something
that
will
muck
up
quite
a
lot
of
trials.
so,
therefore,
the
sentence
that
jumps
out
the
page
here
was
where
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
rule
403's
exclusion
is
an
extraordinary
remedy
that
should
be
sparingly...
used
sparingly.
is
that
a
general
rule?
because
my
impression
was...
and
this
is
why
i
asked
you
as
a
trial
lawyer...
is
that
if
you
take
401
and
402
and
read
them
literally,
we'll
have
trials
that
last
a
thousand
years.
and,
really,
the
way
a
trial
judge
keeps
the
trial
under
control
is
to
say:
well,
maybe
there
is
some
slight
tendency
here
to
make
a
fact
more
likely
than
not;
but,
even
if
that's
so,
this
is
a
waste
of
time.
and
i
thought
that
kind
of
decision
is
what
trial
judges
are
there
to
make.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
therefore,
i
thought
this
court
of
appeals
is
trying
to
second-guess
that
trial
court
judge
unless
that
trial
court
judge
is
making
an
absolute
rule,
which
he
may
have
been.
but
as
soon
as
we
get
into
this
case,
i
thought
we
might
do
quite
a
lot
of
harm
by
trying
to
let
the
court
of
appeals
second-guess
trial
courts
on
this
kind
of
thing.
now,
i
would
appreciate
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
how
are
we
going
to...
i'm
not
arguing
about
what
it
says
so
much
as
i'm
arguing
about
who
has
the
right
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
to
decide?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
all
i'm
worried
about...
and
you
tell
me
if
that's
the
law
in
the
tenth
circuit
or
elsewhere.
i
was
an
appeals
court
judge
for
a
quite
a
while.
and
i
think
we
have
never...
not
"never",
but
hardly
ever
second-guessed
a
trial
judge
on
that
kind
of
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
tell
me
if
the
rules
are
different
in
the
tenth
circuit?
do
they
out
there
second-guess
trial
judges
on
this
kind
of
question
all
the
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
they
don't
normally,
why
should
they
here?
if
this
kind
of
rule
is...
as
you
say,
this
kind
of
evidence
is
like
any
other
evidence,
any
other
evidence
at
all.
it
may
be
relevant,
or
it
may
not
be.
it
depends
on
the
case.
a
waste
of
time
or
not
depends
on
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
got
your
blanket
part.
i
got
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
not...
i'm
saying...
well,
you
got
my
point,
but
you're
just
not
answering
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
it
is
hearsay
or
not.
i'm
not
talking...
i'm
talking
about
whether
it
comes
in
401,
402,
403.
that's
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
ut
have
been?
what
about
the
date
problem
he
just
mentioned?
you
said...
your
opponent
said
that
when
you
filed
this
motion
in
limine
on
december
15,
2004,
by
that
time,
there
hadn't
been
any
fact-specific
things
at
all
brought
up
in
the
trial
that
were
relevant
to
this,
and
there's
certainly
none
in
the
notion
that
i
could
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
where
does
it
say?
i
can't
find
in
the
motion,
although
there
is
something
on
disparate
impact,
anything
that
says
well,
you
see,
i
don't
know
about
the
general
mine
run
of
cases,
but
in
this
particular
case,
it's
not
sufficiently
material,
it
is
a
waste...
it's
not...
it
is
a
waste
of
time.
now,
i
just
can't
find
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
anyone
argue
that
before
december
15,
2004,
that
we
don't
know
about
the
mine
run
of
cases,
but
this
case,
in
fact
it's
a
waste
of
time?
did
anyone
argue
that
before
december
15,
2004?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
yes
or
no;
did
they
or
didn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
