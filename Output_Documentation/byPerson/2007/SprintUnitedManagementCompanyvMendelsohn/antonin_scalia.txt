justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
really
know,
do
we,
what
the
district
court's
order
was
based
on?
whether
it
was
based
on
401
or
403?
did
the
district
court
explain
its
order
at
all?
it
didn't,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah.
how
do
we
know
that's
what
the
district
court
adopted?
i
have...
is
it
the
order
on
24a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mention...
it
doesn't
mention
which
of
the
two
of
your
arguments
the
district
court
is
relying
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
not
talking
about
the
rule.
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
it
was
the
district
court
did.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
the
worst.
i
mean,
assumed
what
makes
the
case
the
hardest
for
you,
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
district
court
relied
on
401.
is
it
customary
to
assume
the
worst?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there's
any
basis
on
which
the
district
court's
decision
would
have
been
correct,
the
district
court's
decision
is
upheld.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
want
to
defend
the
harder
ground,
i
understand.
but
what
justice
breyer
has
just
said
is
not
necessarily
so.
the
403
as
well.
if
they're
similarly
situated,
the...
the
time
it
would
take
to
let
in
these
other
things
and
rebuttal
of
them,
plus
the
prejudicial
effect
on
the
jury,
would
be
outweighed
by
the
fact
that
they're
similarly
situated,
and,
therefore,
that
it
is
stronger
proof.
i
don't
see
that
one
can
tell
from
the
district
court's
order
whether
the
district
court
was
relying
on
401
or
403.
and
certainly,
you
just
don't
want
to
defend
403.
i
think
you're
digging
a
hole
for
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
here
you
have
a
company
of
70,000
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
hard
to
see
what
wouldn't
be
marginally
relevant
if
you
think
that's
marginally
relevant.
it
has
to
be
a
different
supervisor
in
a
different
time
frame.
i
mean,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
relevant...
the
same
vicinity?
you're...
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--opposing
counsel
has
said
they
are...
they
are
three
supervisors
up.
what
does
the
same
vicinity
have
anything
to
do
with
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one...
one
would
have
some...
some
tendency--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
one
instead
of
three?
would
that
have
some
tendency?
i
guess
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
by
the
way,
do
you
think
this
was
excluded
under...
under
401
rather
than
403?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
why
should
it
be
assumed
it
was
done
properly
rather
than
improperly?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
said
in
the
order?
i
see
nothing
in
the
order
that
indicates
it
is
under
401.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
very
relevant
to
the
403
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
picky,
picky,
picky
on
the
trial
court.
i
must
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
this
order
should
be...
should
be
given...
it
should
be
treated
as
if,
it
could
be
sustained,
it
should
be
sustained.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
assert
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
pursuant
to
the
same
reduction
in
force
is
enough
of
a
connection.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
even
one
of
these
three
had
existed?
only
one
these
three?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
these
three
other
employees
who
complained
about
age
discrimination.
would
that
have
the
same
tendency
to
show
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
one
is
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
somebody
up
at
the
top.
i'm
talking
about
somebody
on
the
same
level
as
the
supervisor
that
you're
concerned
with.
one
other
supervisor
in
this
company
of
70,000
has...
is
accused
of
having
made
age-discriminatory
decisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
of
these
are
just
accused.
we
have...
none
of
this
has
been
proven.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
egan,
what
if
i
think
that,
had
he
engaged
in
a
balancing,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
exclude
it?
what
if
i
think
that?
then
what
happens
with
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
am
worried
about
having
five
trials...
you
know,
one
trial
turning
into
six
trials.
i
mean
those
are
the
factors
that
i
am
concerned
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
may
have
just
thought
the
game
isn't
worth
the
candle.
just
thought
we've
sunk
so
much
money
into
this
case
by
now
and
it's
just
not
worth
the
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
problem
that
concerns
me.
it
is
not
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
is
going
to
last
for
three
weeks.
it
is
a
question
at
the
prospect
that
the
trial
will
last
for
three
weeks
and
they
will
have
to
go
out
and
find
other
people
in
their
organization
and
depose
them
and
bring
them
in
to
show
them
it
is
not
the
culture.
they
just
say
it
is
not
worth
the
candle.
just
settle
the
case
and
get
out.
all
of
these
things
are
relevant
to
how
you
rule
on
403
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
we...
there's
been...
the
case
went
to
the
jury
without
the
evidence
you
wanted
to
get
in.
the
jury
found
for
the
company.
now
if
the...
if
the
trial
court
is
going
to
properly
exclude
the
evidence
under
403,
we
should
then
have
the
very
same
trial
with
a
new
jury?
that
doesn't
seem
proper.
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
don't
want
that
clarification
to
be
done
at
the
expense
your
client,
i
take
it?
[laughter]
