mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
evidence
of
discrimination
by
other
supervisors
within
the
company
is
sometimes
but
not
always
admissible
in
a
disparate-treatment
case
to
help
prove
discrimination
by
the
plaintiff's
own
supervisor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
the
evidence
under
both
rules,
the
first
question
being
whether
it
meets
the
minimum-evidence
threshold
in
401.
and
that
is
a
very
low
threshold
set
by
the
federal
rules.
the
second
question
being
whether
it
may
be
excluded
under
rule
403,
which
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
we
do
think
that
there
are
some
instances
where
other-supervisor
evidence
is
not
admissible
under
401.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
large
company
and
you
have
a
plaintiff
in
the
chicago
office
claiming
that
her
supervisor
had
it
out
for
her
and
she
wants
to
put
on
the
testimony
of
an
employee
in
the
seattle
office
who
two
years
ago
complained
that
her
supervisor
had
it
out
for
her,
we
think
that
that
would
not
be
relevant
under
401.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
you
have
a
company
of
70,000
people,
but
you
have
allegations
that
supervisors
in
the
same
division,
implementing
the
same
company-wide
reduction-in-force
plan
in
the
same
timeframe
and
giving
similar
explanations
under
similar
circumstances,
engaged
in
discrimination.
we
think
that
the
district
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
to
say
that
evidence
of
that
kind
is
at
least
marginally
relevant,
which
would
then
put
the
focus
on
whether
this
evidence
could
be
excluded
under
403.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
you've
got
other
situations
as
well,
justice
scalia.
i
think
we've
got
a
situation
of
a
general
comment
of
discriminatory
animus.
for
example,
older
people
just
don't
get
it,
something
like
that.
i
think
the...
the...
by
a
different
supervisor.
i
think
even
if
that's
within
the
same
office,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
hard-pressed
even
to
meet
the
minimum-relevance
threshold.
but
the
relevance
threshold,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
furnco
v.
waters
case
and
the
huddlestone
case,
this
is
a
broad
threshold
that
allows
evidence
in.
and
then
we
look
at
the
other
parts
of
article
iv
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
to
see
whether
it
may
be
excluded--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
would
point
to
several
criteria,
justice
scalia,
in
determining
relevance.
first,
whether
you're
dealing
with
same
alleged...
same
kind
of
alleged
discrimination
and
a
common
catalyst;
second,
whether
the
proffered
witnesses
are
working
in
the
same
corporate
vicinity;
third,
whether
they
are
alleging
discrimination
in
the
same
time
frame;
four,
whether
they
are
alleging
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
you
would
look
at
the
proffered
evidence.
for
example,
in
this
case
you
have
evidence
that
all
of
the
proffered
witnesses
were
terminated
under
the
same
companywide
reduction
in
force.
you've
got
a
common
catalyst.
in
this
case,
you've
got
employees
who
worked
in
the
same
geographic
vicinity,
the
headquarters
of
sprint,
the
same
office
complex
or
at
least
the
same
vicinity.
you've
got
witnesses
who
were
terminated
on
the
same
day--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it
is
more
likely--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--where
you
have
supervisors
in
the
same
division,
in
the
same
vicinity,
carrying
out
the
same
plan,
providing
the
same
distinct
explanations
in
similar
circumstances,
a
reasonable
juror
might
infer
that
plaintiff's
own--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
with
respect
to
the
minimum
threshold
of
relevance.
keep
in
mind,
once--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
pattern
of
practice,
maybe
doesn't...
certainly
as
a
matter
of
law
that's
not
a...
going
to
prove
a
pattern
of
practice,
and
the
employer
can
make
that
argument
to
the
district
judge,
to
the
jury,
and
that
evidence
could
be
limited
or
excluded.
if
you
have
got,
for
example,
a...
a
proffered
witness
who's
complaining
that
supervisors
in
the
same
complex
used
the
same
distinctive
explanation
that
my
supervisor
gave
me...
for
example,
in
this
case,
several
of
the
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
that
their
supervisors
told
them
they
were
being...
they
were
removed
because
their
positions
were
being
eliminated,
and
then
they
later
found
out
that
younger
persons
assumed
their
jobs.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
plaintiff
has--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
plaintiffs--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
evidence
is
relevant,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
as
i
said
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
the
evidence
is
relevant,
that
it
has
some
tendency
to
make
a
fact
or
consequence
more
likely.
this
court
in
the
huddlestone
case
confronted--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
justice
scalia--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
might.
and
that
probably
would
be
a
strong
candidate
for
exclusion
under
403.
in
the
furnco
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we...
we
acknowledge
that
the
record
isn't
precisely
clear
on
that.
we
think
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--largely
because
of
what
was
said
in
the
order,
and
because
of
the
way
it
was
briefed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
it
doesn't
say
401,
but
the
reason
why
the
evidence
can't
come
in
is
because
the...
the
proffered
witnesses
didn't
have
the
same
supervisor.
the
order
is
on
page
24.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
what
the
court
excluded
is
any
evidence
of
the
pattern--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
relevant,
but
not
it's
certainly
not
determinative,
and
we
think
in
a
case
like
this,
where
this
kind
of
evidence
is
the
critical
evidence
for
the
trial...
in
the
case--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yeah--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
in
this
case,
this
proffered
evidence
was
the
crux
of
the
trial,
the
critical
issue.
it
came
up
not
only
in
the
context
of
the
motion
in
limine,
it
came
up
in
the
context
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
if
you
look
at
what
the
district
court
said
in
denying
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
she
said
again...
and
this
is
on
page
436
of
the
ja...
she
says,
"none
of
the
proffered
evidence
makes
it
more
likely
that
the
decisionmakers
in
this
case
discriminated
against
the
plaintiff.
"
that's
relevance
language,
and
you're
quite
right--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
the
district
court
serves
as
a
gateway.
district
courts
have
tremendous
discretion
under
the
federal
rules
to
determine
whether
or
not
evidence
is
relevant,
and
whether
or
not
it
should
be
excluded
under
403.
so
that
determination
is
made
by
the
district
court.
in
some
cases,
as
happened
in
the
huddlestone
case...
that
was
a
404(d)
case...
the
court
acknowledged
in
some
cases
the
evidence
may
go
in
and
then
the
jury
may
instruct
that
that
evidence
is
allowed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
if
you're
pointing
to
other
acts
of
discrimination
by
other
supervisors
that
are
relevant,
then
that
would
be
allowed
in,
and
the
employer
would
come
in
and
present
their
counter
evidence--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
our
system
we
put
that
evidence
before
a
jury.
if
it
is
relevant
under
the
federal
rules,
it
is
admissible.
we
put
before
a
jury--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--in
the
furnco
case,
the
court
said
that...
that
the
evidence
doesn't
have
to
conclusively
demonstrate
the
fact.
it
simply
has
to
be
relevant.
we
put
relevant
evidence
before
juries,
we
instruct
them
on
the
consideration
of
that
evidence,
permit
the
defendants
to
put
that
evidence
into
context,
and
then
we
ask
juries
to
draw
a
conclusion--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no.
i
think
you'd
look
at
it
under
the
relevance
threshold,
and
i
think
you'd
look
at
it
under
403.
403
is
going
to
exclude
a
lot
of
this
evidence.
it
is
going
to
exclude
the
barely
evidence,
the
barely
relevant
evidence.
but
it...
we
would
expect
a
trial
court
in
this
kind
of
situation
to
make
some
kind
of
findings
as
to
why
this
evidence
is
excludable,
and
we
would
expect
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
undertake
a
de
novo
403
balancing
in
its
own
instance.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct,
and
that's
the
way
this
case
was
litigated
all
the
way
until
to
the
reply
brief
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
