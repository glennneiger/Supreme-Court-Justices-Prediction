justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
respondent
was
employed
by
petitioner
from
1989
until
2002
when
she
was
terminated
as
part
of
a
companywide
reduction
in
force.
she
sued
petitioner
under
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
of
1967
alleging
desperate
retreatment
based
on
age.
in
support
of
her
claim,
respondent
sought
to
introduce
testimony
by
five
other
former
employees
of
petitioner
who
claimed
that
their
supervisors,
different
supervisors,
had
discriminated
against
them
also
because
of
age.
petitioner
moved
to
exclude
the
testimony,
arguing
that
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
central
issue
in
the
case,
whether
petitioner
was
terminated
by
her
supervisor
because
of
age.
in
a
minute
order,
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
excluding
in
relevant
part
evidence
of
discrimination
against
employees
not
similarly
situated
to
plaintiff.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
treated
the
minute
order
as
the
application
of
a
per
se
rule
that
evidence
from
employees
with
other
supervisors
is
irrelevant
to
proving
discrimination
in
an
age
discrimination
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
have
the
district
court
clarify
the
basis
for
its
ruling.
reviewing
courts
should
afford
broad
discretion
to
a
district
court's
evidentiary
rulings.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion,
nothing
in
the
brief
minute
order
of
the
district
court
includes
analysis
suggesting
that
the
district
court
improperly
applied
a
per
se
rule
to
exclude
the
evidence.
when
a
district
court's
language
is
ambiguous,
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
simply
presume
that
the
lower
court
reached
an
incorrect
legal
conclusion.
the
court
of
appeals
further
erred
by
proceeding
to
conduct
its
own
balancing
of
the
evidentiary
factors
after
it
concluded
that
the
district
court
had
applied
an
incorrect
rule
of
law.
instead,
it
should
have
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
properly
apply
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
the
first
instance.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
