mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
chief
justice
roberts,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
basic
principal
of
evidence
of
the
need
for
foundation
explains
why
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
an
employment
decision
is
made
by
the
person
who
made
it,
the
decision-maker.
if
some
other
person
harbors
bias,
that's
unfortunate;
but
it
is
not
probative
of
claims
by
a
plaintiff
who
is
not
affected
by
it.
this
court's
discrimination
cases,
both
in
the
employment
context
and
in
other
contexts,
consistently
focus
on
the
decision
maker's
intent,
not
on
the
intent
of
other
persons.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
yeah,
if
the
district
court
had
held
that
under
no
circumstances
could
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
be
shown,
i
think
that
would
have
been
error.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
was
focusing
on.
the
district
court
focused
on
the
nexus
of
the
disputed
witnesses
to
the
plaintiff.
the
district
court
did
not
hand
out
a
cookie
cutter
ruling
at
the
courthouse
door.
the
district
court
did
not
say
oh,
this
is
a
discrimination
case,
hear
are
the
rules
of
evidence
i
apply
in
a
discrimination
case.
what
the
district
court
here
did
was
consider
sprint's
motion
in
limine,
which
was
grounded
in
the
evidence
that
had
emerged
in
discovery
in
this
case.
plaintiff
then
responded
to
that
motion
in
limine
by
trying
to
explain
why
the
evidence
was
relevant
given
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
plaintiff
then
filed
a
witness
list,
which
explained
what
each
of
the
disputed
witnesses
would
say
in
this
case;
and
the
plaintiff
finally
made
an
offer
of
proof
which
again
collaborated
on
what
plaintiff
contended
the
disputed
witnesses
would
say
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
the
district
court
did
not
specifically
invoke
rule
403.
i
think
it's...
my
reading
of
it
that
it
is
grounded
in
both
401
and
403.
the
motion
in
limine
relied
on
both
401
and
403,
the
district
court
told
counsel
that
she
wanted
the
jury
to
be
focusing
on
the
claims
of
this
plaintiff
and
not
be
distracted
by
claims
of
others.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
don't
think
there's--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--we
have
here
five
persons,
who
out
of
15,000--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--the
answer
to
the
question
is
no,
it
doesn't.
as
this
court
taught
in
teamsters--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--a
pattern
or
practice
is
not
established
by
anecdotes.
and
what
we
have
here
are
anecdotes
of
5
persons
out
of
the
15,000--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that's
why
i
started
with
the
importance
of
emphasizing
foundation.
to--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--for
relevance
to
exist,
there
would
have
to
be
a
foundational
showing.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
the
foundation,
justice
ginsburg,
would
be
some
linkage
between
the
decision
making
supervisor
and
the
supervisors
whose
acts
or
conduct
is
assailed
by
the
plaintiff.
and
if
there's
no
showing
of
nexus
other
than
the
fact
that
they
both
happen
to
draw
a
paycheck
from
sprint--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--no.
i
think
the
nexus
requires
more
than
a
common
zip
code.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
think,
in
a
company
that
was
not
small,
where
a
nexus
could
be
inferred,
that
there
was
consultation
or
that
there
were
directions
from
more
senior
management,
then
i
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate
foundation.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
did
i
under
your
question
to
be
three
supervisors
in
the
whole
company
or
three
supervisors
out
of
this
vast
company
that
we're
talking
about?
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
not
absent
some
reason
to
believe
that
they
conferred
or
they
received
directions.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
if
there
were...
if
two
out
of
three,
i
think
there
might
be
an
argument
that
at
least
it
was
a
jury
question
at
that
stage.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
but
here
we're
dealing
with
a
70,000-employee
company.
we
have
five
witnesses
who
are
principally
assailing
two
persons.
so--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
think
there...
there
should
be
a
guiding
principle.
and
the
guiding
principle
was
that
other-supervisor
evidence
should
be
presumptively
irrelevant,
and
that
would
be
the
rule
in
the
normal
run
of
cases,
at
least
in
dealing
with
entities
of
this
magnitude.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
that's
normally
how--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that's
normally
how
it
would
present
itself,
and
indeed
the
district
court
normally
would
consider
rule
403
consideration
if
that's
the
case.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
70,000.
7-0-0-0-0.
yes.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
the
motion
was
grounded
in
both
rule
401
and--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that
is
so,
but
what
the
district
judge
adopted
was
grounded
in
the
offer
of
proof
that
had
been
made
here
and
the
evidence
that
was
proffered
here.
the
district
court
was
not
issuing
a
blanket
ruling
that
would
have
governed
any
potential--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that
would
be
the
rule
in
the
normal
run
of
cases
where
there
is
no
showing
of
connection.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
no.
i
think
it
would
be
customary
to
assume
that,
particularly
on
an
issue
of
evidence,
that
the
district
court
was
presumptively
correct,
and
that--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--it
could
be
affirmed
on
that
ground.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
the
general
rule
applies
because
there
was
no
showing
here
of
any
relationship
between
the
decision
at
issue
here
and--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--no,
i
absolutely
want
to
defend
403.
if
there
was
any
minimal
probative
value
here,
justice
scalia,
all
the
countervailing
403
factors
are
present.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
that
is
what--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
had
the
"me,
too"
evidence
been
admitted,
then
we
would
have
had
to
respond
with
what
might
be
called
"not
you,
either"
evidence.
and
then
the
plaintiff
would
have
made
a
rebuttal
to
that
showing,
and
we
would
have
had
trials
within
a
trial
on
whether
these
couple
of
persons
that
plaintiff
identified
as
potential
bad
actors
were,
in
fact,
bad
actors.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
i
think
it
can
happen
both
ways.
and
really
here
it
happened
both
ways,
too,
because
although
it
was
teed
up
as
a
motion
in
limine,
as
the
trial
evolved,
the
district
court
actually
relaxed
her
ruling
and
expanded
it
to
permit
attacks
both
on
reddick,
who
was
the
direct
supervisor,
but
also
decisions
made
by
blessing,
who
was
reddick's
boss.
and
the
district
court
explained
that,
as
she
thought
about
it
further,
that
additional
bit
of
latitude
should
be
given
to
both
sides
because
there
was
evidence
that
blessing
had
consulted
with
reddick.
and,
in
other
words--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that's
correct.
and
that
to
me
is
the
proper
test.
if
the
decisionmaker's
supervisor
was
demonstrated
to
be
biased,
then
i
think
that
has
some
relevance
because
it
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
that
bias--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--and,
more
importantly,
the
other
supervisors
were
persons
that
were
not
shown
to
have
any
connection
with
the
decisionmaker
with
respect
to
this
plaintiff.
and
so,
yes,
if
you
are
going
to
define
403--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--it
could
be
relevant
if
there
were
a
showing
that
the
bias
on
the
part
of
the
other
supervisors
somehow
tainted
the
decision
making
of
the
instant
decisionmaker.
and
in
the
cases
that
ms.
mendelsohn
cites
in
her
brief,
those
are
all
cases
in
which
a
directive
was
given
from
a
more
senior
official
to
the
decisionmaker.
what
we
have
here
are
decisionmakers
in
far-flung
areas
elsewhere
within
the
company
with
no
showing
whatsoever
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
them.
each
of
the
five
disputed
witnesses
here
testified
in
deposition
that
they
had
no
information
whatsoever
to
shed
about
the
decisionmakers
with
respect
to
ms.
mendelsohn.
and
so
in
those
circumstances
there's
no
foundational
showing
of
relationship,
no
foundational
showing
of
nexus.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
it
was
just
these
five
people.
the
only
statistics
in
the
case
were
that
the
number
of
persons
over
50
in
this
particular
unit,
the
business
development
strategy
group,
actually
increased;
and
that
the
oldest
person
at
any
particular
level
within
the
business
development
strategy
group
was
retained
and
not
laid
off.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
that
spreadsheet
was
linked
to
some
supervisor
named
kennedy,
who
bore
no
relationship
to
this
department
and
no
relationship
to
these
decisionmakers.
let's
assume
that...
that
allegation
is
untested,
but
let's
assume
that
mr.
kennedy
was
correctly
identified
as
a
bad
actor.
again,
that
has
no
relationship.
it
might
have
everything
to
do
with
any
layoff
decision
made
by
kennedy
or
made
by
someone
kennedy
supervised.
but
it
bears
no
relationship
to
ms.
mendelsohn's
circumstances
because
there
was
no
showing
that
a
similar
spreadsheet
was
used
by
any
of
her
decisionmakers.
let's
assume
that
kennedy
is,
like
the
two
others,
stock
and
voorhees,
perhaps
a
bad
actor.
that
just
doesn't
shed
any
meaningful
light
on
the
circumstances
of
the
plaintiff
here;
and
even
if
it
did
shed
some...
some
bit
of
light--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
don't
know
that--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--and
they
had
full
and
fair
discovery
to
try
and
demonstrate
that.
but
their
own
witnesses
testified
that
they
were
unaware
of
any
relationship
between
themselves
and
their
decisionmaker
and
the
plaintiff
and
the
plaintiff's
decision-maker.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
no.
it
doesn't
say,
justice
kennedy.
let
me--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--it
is
a
different
person.
sure,
if
you
go
far
enough
up
the
corporate
ladder,
eventually
you
will
end
up--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--not
the
next
step
up,
the
next
step
after
that,
and
not
the
next
step
after
that.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
if
a...
no
matter
what
level,
i
would
disagree
that
if
a
discriminating
supervisor
is
in
the
chain
of
command
and
supervises
the
decisionmaker,
then
i
think
there's--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
think
that's
right.
if
there's
a
showing
the
actual
decisionmaker
could
have
been
tainted
by
it,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that
if
you're
going
to
have...
what
we
have
here
is,
in
effect,
an
assault
on
the
corporate
character
of
the
company
and
not
an
assault--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
held
that.
i
think
the
individual
has
a
character,
and
there
is
no
character-evidence
problem
with
showing
that
a
particular
decisionmaker
engaged
in
other
discriminatory
conduct,
because
i
think
that
falls
within
the
exception
to
404.
but
where
the
decisionmaker
is
somebody
else,
then
what
you
really
have
is
an
assault
on
the
corporate
character,
and
i
think
that's
impermissible.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
let
me
begin
by
addressing
justice
kennedy's
question
about
the
rule
403
issue.
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
no
remand
is
necessary.
the
first,
as
justice
scalia
said,
is
that
you
assume
that
the
order
is
correct.
you
don't
assume
that
it's
incorrect.
the
second--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--neither--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--neither
that
case
nor
this
case
involved
any
attempt
to
show
that
foundation,
the
linkage
between
these
other
persons,
these
other
alleged
bad
actors,
and
the
decision
here.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
tenth
circuit...
it...
it
applied
the
incorrect
presumption.
it
should
have
applied
the
presumption
that
an
evidentiary
ruling
is
correct
rather
than
incorrect.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
well,
that
always
will
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
motion
in
limine.
but
the
motion
in
limine
anticipated
the
specific
evidence
that
had
emerged
in
discovery--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--i
don't
think
district
judges
can
be
expected
to,
you
know,
write
opinions
that
are...
to
be
affirmed
to
be
worthy
of
publication
in
f.
supp.
2d.
i
think
the
district
court
considers
the
evidence
thrown
at
him
or
her,
and
in
this
case
all--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--that's
the
time
when--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--no.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
because
that's
when
the
court
considered
notions
in
limine.
the
court
was
not
setting
standards
in
anticipation
of
a
trial
until
the
trial.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
yes,
the
second
is
i
agree
with
justice
alito's
observation,
or
i
think
it
was
his
observation,
that
it
would
have
been
abuse...
an
of
discretion
to
admit
this
evidence
anyway;
and
so
that
gets
you
easily
by
the
403
issue.
i
don't
think
you
need...
there's
a
lot
of
court
of
appeals
cases
that
say
that
where
403
factors
are
obvious,
where
they're
implicit,
there's
not
any
obligation
on
the
court
of
appeals'
part...
or
on
the
district
court's
part...
to...
to
set
them
forth
and
explicitly
engage
in
rebalancing.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
i
think
that,
absent
some
showing
of
relationship
of
nexus,
then
the
presumptive
rule
in
the
run
of
cases
should
be
that
this
evidence
should
not
be
admitted.
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
of
course
not.
let
me
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
solicitor
general's
points.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
said
three
things
with
which
we
agree:
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
lay
foundation;
anecdotes
don't
comprise--
mr.
paul
w.
cane,
jr.
--he
did
say
that,
justice
ginsburg,
but
that's
not
what
their
brief
says.
