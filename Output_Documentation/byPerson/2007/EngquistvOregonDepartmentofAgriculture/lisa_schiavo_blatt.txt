mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
types
of
class-of-one
claims
that
should
not
be
recognized
in
the
public-employment
context.
the
first
is
a
claim
of
residual
ill
will
or
bad-motive
complicitor,
and
the
second
is
a
simple
demand
for
a
rational
basis
for
an
adverse
personnel
decision.
the
problem
with
those
claims
is
that
they
would
constitutionalize
routine
employee
grievances
and
impose
a
for-cause
requirement
on
public
employers,
notwithstanding
the
long
tradition
of
at-will
public
employment.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
is
similar.
and
in
the
regulatory
context
a
personality
conflict
is
not
a
legitimate
basis
for
adversely
treating
citizens.
but
a
personality
conflict
between
a
supervisor
and
a
subordinate
is
generally,
if
not
always,
a
legitimate
basis
for
adversely
treating
an
employee.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there
is
some
support
in
the
case
law,
but
what
i
think
your
concurring
opinion
was
trying
to
do
was
to
help
local
and
state
governments.
and
it
is
one
thing
to
say
the
mayor
denied
my
building
permit,
and
i'm
going
to
make
the
employee
allege
animus,
and
that
might
be
difficult
to
do.
but
for
someone
on
the
mayor's
staff,
it's
not
that
difficult
to
allege
animus
on
the
part
of
your
supervisor.
employment
frictions
are
inherent
in
the
workplace,
and
perceptions
of
unfair
treatment
readily
arise
by
an
employee
who
thinks
he
or
she
was
unfairly
treated.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
sure,
it
applies.
it
just
doesn't
give
you
a
right
to
collect
what
this
plaintiff
did:
punitive
and
compensatory
damages
based
on
residual
ill
will.
she
ran
an
equal-protection
claim
on
race,
gender,
national
origin,
sex.
she
had
a
statutory
claim
for
imposing
unlawful
conduct
under
title
vii.
the
jury
rejected
all
of
that
and
imposed
punitive
damages,
and
it
went
to
the
jury
on
a
legal
question
that
has
always
been
decided
by
this
court
and
the
courts
about
whether
there
was
a
rational
basis
or
whether,
instead,
it
was
solely
based
on
vindictive,
arbitrary,
or
malicious
reasons.
it
went
to
the
jury,
and
there
was
no
allegation
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
doesn't...
no.
if
you
have
a
membership
in
an
identifiable
group
classification
as
opposed
to
purely
subjective
and
individualized
criteria.
here
the
class
was:
i
was
a
thorn
in
my
supervisor's
side.
that
is
not
a
class.
and
if
it
is
a
class,
it
would
lose,
because
you
would
always
have
a
rational
basis.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
and...
and
in
first
amendment...
and
that's
a
different
amendment,
but
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
is
the
batson
context.
it's
just...
just
like
in
the
batson
context,
the
high
cost
of
litigating
every
single
claim
to
try
to
ferret
out
what
would
truly
be
an
irrational
decision
is
not
worth
the
cost
when
there
is
such
an
overwhelming
likelihood
that
a
truly
irrational
decision
would
already
be
prohibited
by
some
other
contract
or
statutory
source.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
we
are
not
relying
on
the
text
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
what
we
are
relying
on
are
two
principles.
and
there
is
just
a
longstanding
principle
that
the
constitution
is
not
the
appropriate
forum
to
resolve
routine
employment
disputes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
well,
one
is
criminal
conduct,
and
on
the
scapegoat
case
i
actually
don't
think
that's
such
a
bad
thing.
one
can
recharacterize
scapegoating
as
public
accountability,
and
their
side
would
allow
federal
courts
and
state
courts
to
second-guess
a
local
employment's
response
to
a
public
crisis.
so
if
there
is
a
school
board
or
some
tragic
accident
in
the
city,
and
a
group
of
employees
are
fired,
their
side
would
give
constitutional
claim
for
punitive
and
compensatory
damages
based
on
a
finding
of
ill
will;
and
although
the
other
side
comes
up
here
and
tells
a
story
about
traditional
rational
basis,
in
this
case
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
about
whether
there
was
a
rational
basis
or
whether
whatever
articulated
basis
was
a
mere
pretext;
it
was
treated
basically
like
a
sex,
or
gender,
a
race
claim,
and
not
a
rational
basis
claim.
this
should
have
never
gone
to
the
jury.
it's
not
a
fact
question
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
right.
in
a
mixed-motive
constitutional
case
involving
a
fundamental
right,
it's
a
fact
question
for
the
jury.
in
a
rational
basis
case
it
would
be
a
question
for
the
court
whether
there
is
a
conceivable
rational
basis.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
if
the
mayor
doesn't
give
the
employee
a
grievance,
in
her
capacity
as
a
citizen
she
has
a
suit
under
olech;
but
in
her
termination
claim,
she...
unless
she
can
allege
membership
in
an
identifiable
class,
she
doesn't
have
an
equal
protection
right
to
be
free
from
just
pure
arbitrariness...
16--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--why?
because
personality
conflicts
have
no
role
in
the
regulatory
context
and
they
generally
if
not
always
are
the
legitimate
basis
for
a
personnel
decision.
it's
just
that...
they
say
this
example,
well,
employer
doesn't
like
you;
that's
sufficient;
but
the
other
side
never
tells
you
how
far
they
would
take
that.
is
it
because
the
conflict
arose
in
the
workplace;
is
it
because
it
arose
from
their
neighborhood;
is
it
because
it
arose
from
the
high
school
debate
team
or
law
review
or
cheerleading
squad
and
that's
why
the
person
wasn't
hired?
and
we
would
have
courts
having
just
to
go,
judge
by
judge
and
court,
and
in
their
case,
jury
by
jury,
for
these
kinds
of
decisions;
and
these
shouldn't
be
constitutional
cases.
these
are
more
properly
resolved
under
merit
service
protection
laws
and
collective
bargaining
agreements.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
in
the
at-will
context,
if
an
employer
says
you're
fired
and
gives
no
reason,
that's
legitimate;
but
in
their
case
at
least
by
the
time
a
lawyer
is
hired
and
the
case
goes
to
court,
the
state
is
having...
has
to
articulate
a
basis
that
could
be
second-guessed.
if
you
write...
if
you
are
going
to
apply
class-of-one
and
write
a
very
broad
opinion
saying
almost
anything
goes
in
the
employment
context,
that's
certainly
preferable
than
having
us
go
to
juries
based
on
pretext
and
bad
motive,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
but
i
still
think
it
would
impose
a
for-cause
requirement
that's
inconsistent
with
your
due
process
cases,
which
presuppose
that
the
personnel
entitlement
must
spring
from
someplace
other
than
the
constitution.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
unless
you
leave...
right.
there
is
not
point.
i
mean
the
at-will
rule
is
that
no
reason
be
given,
or
it
could
be
a
bad
reason.
and
if
there
is
any
concern
about
the
line
drawing,
i
would
urge
you
just
to
look
at
the
verdict
form
in
this
case.
all
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
after
there
was
the
rejection
of
the
national
origin,
the
gender,
the
race,
the
color,
the
retaliation
for
reporting
sexual
harassment,
was
just
a
simple
case
of
without
any
rational
basis,
and
solely
for
arbitrary,
vindictive
or
malicious
reasons.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
no.
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
constitutional
limits
on
public
employment.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
where
you've
reduced
at
will
for
a
null
set,
and
there
is
any
claim
for
arbitrary
conduct.
i
mean,
we
would
allow
under
our
theory
any
claim
that
is
not
just
a
residual
ill
will
or
bad
motive
states
a
valid
equal
protection
case.
and
this
is
many,
many
statutory
protections
as
well.
