h.

well,
discrimination,
when
you
say
"discrimination",
i
take
it
you're
meaning
discrimination
not
confined
to
the
discrete
categories
of
racial,
age,
et
cetera.
you're
talking
about
discrimination
for
any
purpose.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
the
government
cannot
discriminate,
i
think,
in
effect,
you're
saying
a
government
supervisor
cannot
fire
somebody
simply
because
he
does
not
like
that
person,
because
that's
a
discrimination
in
relation
to
the
people
that
the
supervisor
does
like;
is
that
correct.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
it's
not
government
efficiency;
i
just
don't
want
to
be
around
this
person.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
is
the
case,
then,
that
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
that
the
notion
of
paradigmatic,
at-will
employment
within
the
government
in
any
state
that
recognizes
that
now,
that
will,
in
fact,
be
eliminated
to...
to
the
degree
that
there
is
a...
a
class-of-one
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
just
agreed
that
it
would
happen
in
the
hypothetical
because
as
i...
and
maybe
i
do
not
understand
at-will
employment,
but
i
thought
the
concept
of
at-will
employment
was
that
the
individual
could
be
fired
for
a
good
reason,
a
bad
reason
or
no
reason
at
all.
somewhere
in
that
trinity
we
get
justice
breyer's
hypothetical:
i
don't
like
him.
and
you're
saying
that
won't
pass
muster,
but
it
would
pass
muster
under
an
at-will
employment
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
the
conceivable-basis
test
is
appropriate
when
we
are
judging
legislation,
because
we
don't
know
what
goes
through
the
minds
of
individual
legislators.
whereas,
these
kinds
of
decisions,
employment
decisions,
are,
in
fact,
very
specific
state-of-mind
kind
of
decisions;
and,
therefore,
the
equal-protection
standard
ought
to
take
that
into
consideration
and
look
to
the
specific
reasons?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
we...
can
we
meet
your
objection--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
it
meet
your
concern
if
we
held
number
one,
yes,
there
may
be
a
class
of
claim
in
the
public
employment
context,
but
any
reason
that
would
be
a
lawful
reason
for
discharge
under
the
at-will
rule
is
a...
a
reason
that
would
satisfy
the
test;
and
therefore
it
would
be
the
real
outlier
that
would
ever
get
to
the
jury?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
i
mean,
i
wasn't
trying
a
trick
question
but
i...
let
me
be
explicit
about
this.
if
we
adopted
the
rule
that
said
anything
that
goes
under
the
at-will
rule
goes
under
equal
protection
class
of
one,
would
there
be
anything
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
the
reason
is,
if
we
opted
that
rule
you'd
win
across
the
board.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
agree
with
me
that
if
we
adopted
a
rule
that
says
that
anything
that
goes
for
at-will
employment
goes
for
one-person-class
equal
protection,
and
that
that
in
effect
would
eliminate
any
cause
of
action?
