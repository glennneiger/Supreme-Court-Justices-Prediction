what
about
on
the
federal
level?
could
a
federal
employee
who
says
just
what
was
alleged
here
come
right
into
court
to
bring
a
bivens
action
and
says,
i
was
discriminated
against
and
similarly
situated
people
were
not,
and
it
was
irrational?
could
a
federal
employee
come
to
court
with
such
a
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
state
has
civil
service
remedies
that
were
not
used--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
there
were
union
grievance
procedures
that
aren't
used?
you
can
go
right
into
federal
court
and
say,
i
don't
have
to
use
those
state
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
this
case.
you
say
there
were
30
similarly
situated
people
with
regard
to
this
employee
being
let
go.
wouldn't
that
be
a
contested
matter?
the
employer
will
say
they
are
not
similarly
situated;
each
of
them
is
differently
situated.
how
does
that
get
resolved
on
summary
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
they
withdrew
from
saying
that
it
was
a
budgetary
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
did
not
agree
with
that
in
your
brief.
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
said
no
hypothetical
justification
is
there.
not
like
legislation
where
any
conceivable
basis,
even
if
the
legislature
didn't
conceive
it.
i
thought
you
were
quite
clear
in
saying
no,
that's
not
what
rational
basis
means
in
this
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
of
those
involved
a
group
characteristic.
one
involved
people...
beazer,
wasn't
it
was
methadone
users?
but
none
of
them
involved
a
situation
like
this,
where
she
is
not
claiming
anything
about
being
a
member
of
any
identifiable
class.
she
is
just
saying,
they
discriminated
against
me...
not
because
of
sex,
race
or
anything
else.
they
were
out
to
get
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
brought
up...
you
said
this
is
1983.
it's
a
cause
of
action
provided
by
congress.
so
that's
why
this
is
something
state
and
municipal
employees
can
do,
but
no
federal
employee
could
do.
1985
also
uses
the
word
1985(3),
that
claim,
it
has
to
be
some
group-based
animus,
not
malice
directed
toward
a
particular
individual.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
because
1985(3)
is
in
a
discrimination
context,
the
court
could
say
1983...
we
know
the
classification
to
which
justice
breyer
was
referring,
tax
classifications,
zoning
classifications,
but
this
group
of
claims
we're
cutting
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
a...
it's
a
general
statute.
it's
not
a
precise
statute
like
title
vii
or
the
age
discrimination
act.
so
it's
the
kind
of
legislation
that
seems
much
more
amenable
to
court
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
certainly
opens
a
can
of
worms
to
say
that
you
take
every
claim
against
the
government,
every
claim
of
wrongdoing
by
the
government,
and
make
it
an
equal
protection
claim
because
you
say
other
people
were
treated
properly
and
i
was
treated
improperly;
therefore,
i
have
an
equal
protection
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
decision
would
rule
out
the
case
where
an
employee
says:
i
was
the
most
qualified
person
for
this
position
by
far,
but
the
supervisors
took
a
bribe
from
a
rich
uncle
to
promote
somebody
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
be
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
scapegoat
case,
too,
would
be
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not...
you
know
that
that's
not
the
position
they
took
in
their
brief.
they
said
it's
not
a
hypothetical,
any
conceivable.
they
said
that
by
qualifying...
even
in
the
at-will
category,
the
government
has
to
articulate
a
reason
rooted
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
not
a
hypothetical.
a
hypothetical
reason
is
not
good
enough.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
oregon,
is...
would
there
be
a
civil
service
remedy
available
to
someone
in
this
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
administrative
procedure
act
doesn't
apply
to
state...
to
state
procedures.
it's
a
federal
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--governing
federal
agencies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
this
wasn't...
this
wasn't
employment
at
will,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
do
that
with
the
two
cases
that
i
raised
with
miss
metcalf?
that
is,
the
bribe
case
and
the
scapegoat
case,
they
are
out,
too.
if
public
employment
is
taken
out
from
this
class-of-one,
those
two
cases
would
go
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
if
you
have
a
peremptory
challenge
it
means
that
you
can't
challenge
on
any
basis
other
than
the
group...
the
groups
that
batson
has
recognized.
you...
you
said
you
could
challenge
a
peremptory,
exercise
a
peremptory
challenge
if
it's
unrelated
to
the
selection
of
an
impartial
jury.
well,
i
thought
that
a
peremptory,
outside
of
the
class
cases,
is
matter
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
defense
attorney
don't
like
this
juror.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
ever
been
a
challenge
to
the
exercise
of
peremptory
challenge
on
the
ground
that
the
challenge
was
unrelated
to
the
selection
of
an
impartial
jury?
