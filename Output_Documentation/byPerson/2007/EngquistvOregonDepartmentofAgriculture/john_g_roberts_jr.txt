chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
argument
next
in
case
07-474,
engquist
v.
oregon
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
what
you
do
in
this
case...
i
mean
the
person
is
fired
and
that's
all
you
know.
and
so
you
go
back
and
see:
well,
is
there
any
possible
reason?
so
you
look
at
the
time
sheets.
oh,
here
are
a
few
days
where
she
punched
in
late.
that's
a
possible
reason,
and
that's
enough?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
that
case...
and
then
let's
say
you're
at
trial,
and
you
ask:
did
you
fire
this
person
because
she
punched
in
late
a
few
times?
i
take
it
that
the
objection
would
be
that
that's
irrelevant,
and
that
would
be
sustained.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
the
record
shows
she
was...
a
few
times
she
punched
in
late.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you're
going
to
have
to
articulate
it
in
federal
court.
you
emphasize
it's
a
deferential
standard,
it's
not...
but
every
case
now...
every
case
of
an
employee
firing,
in
fact
every
case
of
employee
not
getting
as
big
a
raise
as
he
thought
he
was
entitled,
that's
now
a
federal
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
title
vii,
there's
no...
you
know,
there
is
no,
"because
you
don't
like
me",
it's
not
because
i'm
a
particular
race
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
not
worried
about
a
frequent
filer.
i'm
worried
about
40
million
single
filers.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
more...
perhaps
a
more
abstract
question
about
this
class-of-one?
doesn't
that
have
the
effect
of
adding
an
equal
protection
claim
to
every
violation
of
law?
in
other
words,
you
have
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
claim,
and
you're
treated
illegally;
you
say
well,
everybody
else
was
treated
legally
and
i
wasn't,
so
it's
an
equal
protection
violation?
you
get...
you
know,
the
zoning
ordinance,
it
was
improper
under
the
zoning
law,
and
because
everybody
else
was
properly
treated,
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katyal.
ms.
metcalf.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but,
as
your
friend
points
out,
the
constitutional
provision
says
"any
person".
it
doesn't
say
any
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
particular
class
or
any
person
who
is
exercising
a
fundamental
right.
it's
"any
person".
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
an
odd
system?
i
mean,
you
have...
like
our
time
card
example,
you're
going
to
have
litigation
over
whether
she
was
late
for
work
or
was
not
late
for
work,
and
in
fact
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
reasons
she
was
fired
at
all.
and
yet
the
government
puts
it
out,
well,
this
is
a
conceivable
reason,
and
then
the
other
side
says,
no,
it's
not,
and
they
fight.
it
just
seems
so
otherworldly;
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
reason
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that's
with
respect
to
legislative
or
regulatory
action,
where
there
are
important
reasons
not
to
inquire
into
the
motives
of
the
legislators.
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
that
same
rationale
applies
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
exactly
is
the
analytic
basis
of
that?
i
mean,
do
you
think
that...
you
don't
think
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
at
all
to
this
situation
where
it's
just
a
class
of
one?
or
do
you
think
that
the
clause
is
always...
the
claim
of
violation
under
the
clause
is
always
rebutted
automatically?
what
is
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
but
that's
very
different,
because
those
cases
say
that
those
individuals
have
no
first
amendment
rights.
in
other
words,
in
the
public
employee
context,
talking
about
their
official
obligations,
there
is
no
first
amendment
right
to
do
that.
i
think
it's
quite
a
different
situation
to
say
there
is
no
equal
protection
right
in
government
employment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
metcalf.
ms.
blatt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
agree
with
all
of
that,
but...
so
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
apply?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
the
equal
protection
clause
applies--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
any
case
of
public
employment...
what...
that's
satisfied?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
balk
about
classes.
it
talks
about
any
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
mr.
katyal,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
answer
to
their
batson
analogy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
you're
adding
the
class
aspect.
if
the
rationale
of
the
prosecutor
is,
i
don't
like
this
person,
under
batson
you
don't
get
to
bring
an
equal
protection
challenge
to
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
04-474,
engquist
versus
oregon
department
of
agriculture.
anup
engquist,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
had
been
an
employee
in
the
oregon
department
of
agriculture,
since
1992.
according
to
engquist,
one
of
her
supervisors
and
one
of
her
coworkers
had
been
antagonistic
toward
her
for
several
years
and
eventually
got
her
fired.
she
brought
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
among
other
things
two
sorts
of
violations
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
first,
she
argued
that
she
had
been
discriminated
against
because
of
her
race,
sex
and
national
origin.
in
other
words,
because
of
her
membership
in
particular
classes.
second,
she
brought
what
has
been
called
a
class
of
one,
equal
protection
challenge
alleging
that
she
was
fired
not
because
she
was
a
member
of
an
identifiable
class,
like
her
race,
sex,
and
national
origin
claim,
but
simply
for
arbitrary,
vindictive,
and
malicious
reasons.
the
district
court
allowed
both
types
of
claims
to
proceed
to
trial.
the
jury
rejected
engquist's
class
based
equal
protection
claims,
but
found
for
her
on
the
class
of
one
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
in
relevant
part.
the
court
recognized
that
this
court
had
upheld
a
class
of
one
equal
protection
challenge
to
state
regulatory
action
in
a
case
called
village
of
willowbrook
versus
olech.
but
the
ninth
circuit
also
recognized
that
we
have
traditionally
afforded
the
government
greater
leeway
when
it
acts
as
employer,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
than
when
it
acts
as
regulator
as
it
was
doing
in
the
olech
case.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
extending
the
class
of
one
theory
to
public
--
and
through
the
public
employment
context
would
lead
among
other
things
to
undo
judicial
interference
in
state
employment
practices.
we
agree,
the
main
concern
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
government
classification
of
its
citizens
into
groups.
thus,
the
equal
protection
clause
plainly
protects
public
employees
from
adverse
actions
taken
on
the
basis
of
the
employees,
membership
in
some
identifiable
class;
the
race,
gender
or
national
origin,
and
nothing
in
today's
decision
alters
that.
but
government
employment
decisions
by
their
nature
involve
discretionary
decision
making
based
on
a
vast
array
of
subjective
individualized
assessments.
in
this
context,
it
may
often
appear
that
similarly
situated
employees
are
treated
differently.
but
it
is
not
a
proper
challenge
to
what
in
its
nature
is
a
subjective
individualized
assessment
that
it
is
subjective
and
individualized.
what
is
more?
we
have
always
been
guided
in
these
types
of
cases
by,
as
we
put
it
in
another
case,
the
“common
sense
realization
that
government
could
not
function
if
every
employment
decision
became
a
constitutional
matter.”
accepting
engquist's
position
would
allow
every
grievance
by
a
public
employee
to
become
a
constitutional
challenge.
we
do
not
believe
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
result.
an
employee
claiming
that
she
was
treated
differently
because
of
her
sex,
race
or
national
origin
has
a
claim.
an
employee
who
just
claims
she
was
treated
differently
does
not.
for
these,
and
other
reasons,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
