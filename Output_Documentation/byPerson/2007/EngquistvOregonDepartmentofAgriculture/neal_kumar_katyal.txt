mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
no
discrimination
against
a
public
employee
is
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
unless
the
targeted
person
is
a
member
of
the
suspect
class
or
exercises
a
fundamental
right.
no
matter
how
outrageous
or
evil
and
no
matter
how
unrelated
to
any
legitimate
government
interest,
the
clause
provides
zero
protection.
this
theory
is
contrary
to
the
constitution's
text.
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
it
is
unworkable
and
is
unnecessary.
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
the
equal
protection
clause's
guarantee
to
any
person
that
the
state
will
not
use
its
vast
powers
to
discriminate
without
a
legitimate
government
purpose
and
particularly
not
in
ways
that
lead
to
inefficient
government.
this
court
has
articulated
three
principles
that
control
this
case.
first,
the
constitution
protects
the
individual
from
irrational
discrimination.
second,
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
public
employers
and
rational-basis
review
applies
to
public
employment.
and
third,
the
clause
applies
to
the
administrative
actions
of
state
officials,
not
just
legislatures.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
are,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
below
said
no
rational-basis
test
ever;
and,
indeed,
the
trial
in
this
case
allowed
the
government
to
articulate
any
rationale,
conceivable
or
not.
we
do
think,
even
though
it
doesn't
make--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
we
do
agree
that
that
last
part,
justice
scalia,
looking
at
could
there
have
been
a
rational
basis,
is
the
proper
test.
but
that
is
a
factual
determination
at
some
level
that,
as
this
court
in
kimel
and
a
variety
of
other
cases
has
said,
that
you
still
have
to
look
to
the
underlying
facts.
and
even
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
disagree
at
page
5
of
their
brief
when
they
say
you
have
to
look
to
whether...
that
whatever
that
rationale
is,
it
is
supported
by
the
record.
the
government
had
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
we
do
think
that
that
can
be
enough;
and,
indeed,
that's
what
the
government
had
their
opportunity
to
argue
in
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit,
of
course,
cuts
off
even
that
very
deferential
inquiry
altogether.
now--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
if
it
is
a
counterfactual...
i
mean,
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
opportunity
to
negate
the
facts
on
whatever
that
rationale.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
government
efficiency,
the
rational-basis
test
is
that
deferential
to
permit
that
to
go
forward.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
even
that,
justice
breyer,
is
enough
so
long
as
it's
related
to
government
efficiency.
that
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that,
by
itself,
is
not
because
the
government
has--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--okay.
let
me
say
two
things
because
there
are
two
different
questions
there.
one
has
to
do
with
the
state
laws,
and
so
on.
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
existence
of
other
state
remedies
somehow
displaces
the
equal
protection
clause
or
other
constitutional
guarantees.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
answer
is
no,
justice
ginsburg,
and
the
reason
is
at
footnote
18
of
our
brief,
and
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
disagree
in
large
amount.
that
is
that
for
bivens
the
question
is,
will
the
court
imply
a
right
of
action,
as
opposed
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
section
1983.
there
is
a
statutory
right
of
action
already
in
existence.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
not--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct.
it
doesn't...
the
existence
of
those
state
remedies
does
not
displace
by
itself
without
a
statutory...
without
congress
coming
in
and
mandating
exhaustion
or
something
like
that.
but
in
the
absence
of
that,
this
court
has
not
said,
outside
of
the
limited
area
of
procedural
due
process,
that
the
existence
of
either
collective-bargaining
agreements
or
state
laws
somehow
displaces
a
federal
constitutional
guarantee.
now,
if
i
could
return
to
the
first
part
of
justice
breyer's
question,
which
was
the
dividing
line
in
whether
there
is
a
clear
standard,
let
me
articulate
this
as
one.
we
believe
that
when
a
government
employer
comes
in
and
asserts
some
sort
of
objective
reality,
you
know,
so
for
here
they
said
the
wheat
prices
are
declining,
the
plaintiff
should
have
a
chance
to
negate
that
and
say,
well,
it
turned
out
that
actually
the
wheat
prices
weren't
declining,
and
so
on.
if,
however,
the
plaintiff...
the
government
articulates
the
rationale
that
you
had
put
forth
before,
i
don't
like
you,
and
somehow
the
supervisor
says
it's
interfering
with
my
government
efficiency
and
i
can't
do
the
job,
well,
that's
something
that
the
employer
will
never
really
be
able
to...
the
employee
will
never
be
able
to
negate.
and
that
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
16.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
government
must
always
have
a
reason
when
it
discriminates
against
individuals.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is...
that
is
correct
as
long
as...
as
long
as,
justice
souter,
it
is
not
related
to
government
efficiency;
that
is,
if
it's
like
this
case,
in
which--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
to
the
contrary,
justice
souter.
i
don't
think
that
will
happen
and
indeed
has
not
happened
and
there
is
not
a
disagreement--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
souter,
as
a
practical
matter
it
won't
matter...
as
a
practical
matter
it
won't
make
a
difference.
and
the
reason
is
because
an
employee
can
articulate,
i
don't
like
you,
and
it's
undermining
government
efficiency,
in
most
cases...
and
particularly
in
at-will
cases,
where
there
isn't
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
a
state
law
that
will
constrain
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
even
articulate
some
sort
of
efficiency--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
if
there
isn't
an
efficiency--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
the
state
can't
articulate
an
efficiency-based
rationale--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--there
will
be
some
effect
on
at-will
employment
in
those
rare
cases.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
except
that
the
cause
that
the
equal
protection
mandates,
the
equal
protection
clauses
guarantee,
is
to
deferential
that
as
justice
breyer
said,
virtually
any
rationale
will
suffice
if
it
is--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
the
government
must
always
have
a
reason?
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
i
read
this
court's
decision
in
olech
as
basically
mandating
that
as
well
as...
you
know,
as
well
as
its
long
history
on
a
class-of-one
starting
with
sioux
city
and
sunday
lake
and
snowden
versus--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
here,
of
course,
the
jury
found
that
invidious
motive.
so
even
if
we
were
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if
the
court
were
worried
about
at-will
employment,
it
has
available
to
it
the
possibility
of
requiring
animus
just
as
justice
kennedy...
or
possibly
in
some--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--if...
if
the
government
articulates
a
rationale
that
is
objectively
based,
budget
or
something
like
that,
yes;
the
plaintiff
can
come
back
and
try
and
rebut.
it
now
it
does
so
under
the
extremely
deferential
rational
basis
test,
which
is
why
so
few
causes
get
through.
and
indeed--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--because
if
the
government
can
put
forth--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--yeah,
i
don't
believe
it
goes
to
the
jury,
justice
alito,
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
summary
judgment
stage
will
incorporate
whatever
the
rationale
basis
test
or
review
is.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
again
as
long
as
the
employer
can
articulate
a
reason
based
on
government
efficiency,
there
is
no
way
for
that
employee
to
rebut
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
the
first
is
those
are
already
federal
cases
under
existing
laws,
title
vii,
the
panoply
of
other
laws.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
but
if
we're
positing
a
frequent
filer
plaintiff
who's
bent
on
trying
to
file
a
lawsuit,
they
can
always
make
a
title
vii.
they
can
say
you're
firing
me
because
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and...
and
the
empirical
evidence,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
that
doesn't
happen.
you
know,
we've
had
this
cause
of
action
now
for
26
and
27
years
in
two
circuits.
it's
now
the
law
of
the
land
in
nine
circuits;
we
haven't
had
that
entire
flood,
nor
have
we
had
the
harm
to
at-will
employment.
and
the
reason
is
that
plaintiffs
aren't
going
to
bring
these
causes
of
action
when
they
know
they
are
so
hard
to
win.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
existing--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
quite
wrong
with
that.
i
would
say
two
things:
one,
the
existence
of
all
of
those
state
remedies
and
so
on
are
far
more
attractive
for
the
employment
plaintiff
than
this
cause
of
action.
and
so,
that's
one
reason
why
you
see
these
low
numbers.
second
is
i
don't
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
lower
courts
are,
you
know,
maybe
not
taking
it
seriously
or
however.
they
have
a
long-established
body
of
law
now
on
how
to
dismiss
these
cases
on
12(b)(6)
motions,
and
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
already
upheld
that
because
of
the
similarly
situated
requirements
and
intentionality
requirements,
as
well
as
on
summary
judgment;
that
is,
because
the
test
is
so
deferential.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
well,
normally
it
depends
on
the
rationale
that's
being
offered.
here
the
government's
rationale
was
declining
wheat
revenues,
and
so
each
of
the
employees
who
was
paid
out
of
those
wheat
revenues
is
similarly
situated.
the
government
in
this
case
disclaimed
the
other
rationales,
performance
and
so
on.
in
the
ordinary
case--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
there
were
two
different
budgetary
issues.
one
was
the
budget
having
to
do
with
the
oregon
state
budget,
and
that
was
ultimately
withdrawn
by
the
state.
the
other
was
that
ms.
engquist
and
10
other
or
so
employees
were
being
paid
out
of
wheat
revenues,
and
the
state's
rationale
at
trial
was
that
the
wheat
market
was
collapsing,
and
so
they
couldn't
pay
for
ms.
engquist
anymore.
and
she
was--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
government
can
offer
those.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely
not.
it
can
pick
many
reasons.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
think
that's
right.
now,
there
are--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
might
have
misunderstood
justice
scalia's
question.
i
thought
he
was
saying
does
the
government...
can
the
government
put
forth
a
conceivable
rationale
grounded
in
some
fact,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
it's
got
to
be
grounded
in
fact.
that
is
the
test.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
government
has
the
ability
to
put
that
forth
and
the
plaintiff
has
the
ability
to
negate
that.
that
is
the
rational-basis
test
under
this.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
as...
to
negate
the
facts.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
long
as,
justice
scalia,
that
rationale
is
itself
grounded
in
the
facts.
that
is,
you
can't
come
in
and
say
she
wasn't...
she
was
coming
to
work
late
when
she
wasn't.
but
if
she
were,
then--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
test
here
is...
the
test
i'm
trying
to
offer
is
one
of
objective...
objective...
whether
the
rationale
is
objectively
falsifiable.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
a
problem,
i
think,
under
this
court's
decision
in
olech
generally.
it
affects
class-of-one--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
do
not.
i
think
this
court
has
had
a
long
history
on--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--let
me
go
back,
justice
kennedy,
to
answer
your
question
more
directly.
this
court
has
held
in
the
employment
case...
in
the
employment
context,
that
the
government
must
have
a
rational
basis.
it
said
so
in
harrah
v.
martin,
beazer
and
murgia,
all
of
which
say
that
when
an
employer
is
dismissing
employees,
it
must
act
with
a
rational
basis.
so
this
court
has
already
crossed
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
quite
think
that
describes
the
fact
of
harrah
v.
martin
in
which
it
was
a
challenge
to
an
individual
termination
decision
by
the
school
board.
but
i
do
agree
the
other
cases
are
group-based
characteristics.
we
don't
think
that
makes
a
difference,
and
indeed
we
think
that
the
solicitor
general's
test
on
this
would
be
unworkable
in
practice,
because
everyone
can
assert
their
membership
in
some
objective--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
i
will
try.
so
the
first
thing
is
that...
i
don't
quite
think
that
describes
the
facts
of
harrah
versus
martin,
which
is
an
individual
decision.
and,
secondly,
once
you
start
going
down
the
line
of
objective,
group-based
characteristics
and
the
like,
it
is
infinitely
manipulable,
and
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
decisions
after,
in
the
wake
of
this
decision
below,
are
dismissing
group-based
claims
on...
on
disability
and
age
and
the
like.
everyone
can
replead
their
claim
as
part
of
a
group,
that
is,
ms....
you
know,
ms.
engquist
can
say
she's
part
of
a
group
of
two,
those
who
complained
about
their
supervisors
and
up
the
chain
of
command.
and
so
the
problem
is
it
becomes
unworkable
in
practice.
and,
of
course,
the
constitution,
justice
ginsburg,
doesn't
say,
the
way
the
solicitor
general
would
like
it
be,
doesn't
say
no
state
shall
deny
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
anyone
who
is
a
member
of
an
objective
group-based,
you
know,
group
and
class.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
quite
think
that...
i
think
the
court
has
already
dealt
with
that
in
olech
by
affirming,
essentially,
a
1983
cause
of
action
based
on
an
individual
person's
claim.
and
so...
and
so
that
is
the
relevant
precedent
here,
not
the
section
1985
precedents.
now,
if
we--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--but
the
statutory
test...
text,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
same.
there's
one
section
19--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
it
might
open
a
whole
can
of
worms
were
the
court
to
say
that
1983
requires
some
group-based
discrimination
outside
of
this
particular
context
that
we
are
talking
about.
and
so
i
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--except,
justice
ginsburg,
we've
had
this
cause
of
action
now
for
26
and
27
years
in
two
circuits;
we
have
it
in
nine.
we
haven't
seen
the
effect
on
at-will
employment
nor,
more
generally,
on
the
equal
protection
clause
opening
up
that
can
of
worms
that
you're
hypothesizing.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
your
honor,
has
cut
out
all
claims
conceivable
or
otherwise,
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
court's
precedent.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
would,
justice
souter,
under
the
formal
rule;
that
is,
no
reason
alone
is
sufficient.
that
of
course
as
a
practical
matter
is
not
the
way
at-will
works
anymore,
because
of
the
panoply
of
rules,
title
7
and
otherwise
that
force
employers
to
articulate
rationales
when
they
terminate
at-will
employees.
so
as
a
practical
matter
the
no-reason
firing
doesn't
exist
anymore
because
those
employees,
those
at-will
employees
who
are
going
to
sue
are
going
to
sue
anyway.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
no.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
text
of
the
equal
protection
clause
encompasses
personal
claims.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
quite
right,
justice
alito.
and
in
fact
since
1879
this
court
has
said--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
not
sure
i
got
that
down,
sir.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i'm
not
sure
if
in
all
other
respects
it
is,
but
with
respect
to
the
relevant
questions
here...
that
is,
does
this
clause
apply
to
individual
agency
actions,
this
court
has
held
so
in
1879
in
missouri
versus
lewis,
and
has
held
so
consistently
ever
since.
so
in
this
case
the
government
put
forth
one
rationale
which
was
an
objective
one,
we...
and
disclaimed
all
the
others,
the
subjective
ones;
and
we
do
think
that
that
subjective
rationales
in
employment
is
different,
and
would
almost
always
be
a
rational
basis.
in
this
case
they
disclaimed
all
those
other
ones.
so
here
the
government
is
using
its
power,
its
raw
power,
surely
for
its
own
personal
ends
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
whole
notion
of
why
employment
should
be
different
within
government
efficiency.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
batson
i
think
supports
exactly
what
we
are
saying,
which
is
this
court
has
said
we
don't
review
on
rational
basis,
actions
by
a
prosecutor
that
are
motivated,
strikes
that
are
motivated
by
the
trial,
that
are...
that
are
for
a
good
trial;
but
if
the
rationale
of
the
prosecutor
is
i
don't
like
the
disabled
person,
or
i
don't
like--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
don't
quite
think
that
this
court
has
confronted
that
specific
issue
about
whether
it's
an
individual
class-of
one
juror
case.
but
the
language
of
batson
says
that
we
don't...
that
this
court
won't
review
on
rational
basis
a
claim
when
it's
related
to
the
government's
motivation.
they
are
to
have
a
fair
trial,
a
good
trial.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
ginsburg,
the
language
in
batson
and
j.e.b.
was
qualified
by
as
saying
so
long
as
it
related
to
the
task
at
hand;
and
the
seventh
circuit
and
indeed,
the
d.c.
circuit
last
year
referred
to
that
language
and
talked
about
an
exemption
if
the
prosecuter's
motive
was
personal,
as
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
in
the
seventh
circuit
decision
the
court
said
this
would
stay
the
cause
of
action.
this
was
after
this
court's
decision
in
j.e.b.,
yes.
