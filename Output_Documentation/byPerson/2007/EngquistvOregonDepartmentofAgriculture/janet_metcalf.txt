ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
this
court's
recognition,
in
other
constitutional
contexts,
that
federal
court
is
simply
not
the
forum
in
which
to
second-guess
everyday
decisions
made
by
public
employers.
it's
also
consistent
with
this
court's
recognition,
again
in
other
constitutional
contexts,
that
the
rights
of
public
employees
simply
are
not
as
expansive
in
a
number
of
ways
as
those
of
citizens
generally
vis-a-vis
their
public
employers.
we
think
that
both
of
those
lines
of
cases
come
at
least
in
part
out
of
the
recognition
that
public
employment
decisions,
indeed
employment
decisions
generally,
are
highly
subjective
in
nature
and
highly
individualistic
in
nature.
we
think
really
that
the
ninth
circuit
here
has
gone
no
farther
than
to
apply
those
concepts
as
a
specific
context
of
class-of-one
cases
brought
in
the
public
employment
context.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
that
would
be
out
as
an
equal
protection
claim.
there
undoubtedly
would
be
other
avenues,
potential
other
avenues,
where--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--yes.
yes,
it
would.
it
would
under
this
rationale--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--and--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--that's
correct.
and
our
formulation
i
think,
of
the
test,
your
honor,
is
that
there
should
be
no
such
thing
as
a
class-of-one
equal
protection
claim
in
the
public
employment
context,
with
certain
exceptions,
those
exceptions
including,
for
example,
exercising
a
fundamental
right;
membership
in
a
suspect
class;
perhaps
certain
other
criteria,
such
as
the
one
you
mentioned,
certain
other
classifications.
but
that
as...
as
a
general
matter,
the
broad
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
faced,
is
there,
outside
of
those
exceptions,
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
class-of-one
public
employment?
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
no,
no,
justice
stevens,
and
again
to
be
clear--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--i
keep
throwing
up--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--no.
because...
and
this
is
why
i
keep
using
quotes
for
"class-of-one".
"class-of-one"
doesn't
literally
describe
the
number
of
plaintiffs,
both
because
in
some
cases
there
might
be
a
single
plaintiff,
but
they're
alleging
discrimination
based
on
membership
in
a
class.
and
because...
and
olech
is
an
example...
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
a
footnote
in
olech,
olech
could
have
been
described
as
a
class
of
five.
but,
again,
we're
talking
about
discrimination
allegedly
based
on
something
other
than
the
exceptions
that
this
court
has
recognized:
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right,
membership
in
a--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--admittedly,
chief
justice
roberts.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
the
constitutional
text
does
us
any
affirmative
good,
but
i
don't
think
it
goes
as
far
as
petitioner
would
have
it
go.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes,
yes.
we
take
no
issue
with
olech.
we--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--not
because
it's
going
to
be
a
big
problem,
but
because
the
regulatory
context
is
significantly
different,
we
think,
than
the
employment
context.
part
of
that
is
the
inherently
subjective
nature
of
employment
decisions.
regulatory
decisions
are
made
at
arm's
length;
they
are
made
under
relatively--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--but...
but
again--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--you
might
have
an
unusual
employment
case
in
which
an
employer
has
drawn
up
a
list
of
objective
criteria.
that's
not
this
case.
that's
not
the
average
case.
in
the
average
case
you
might,
for
example,
prefer
that
someone
have
a
degree,
but--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--no.
we
offer
the
subjective
nature
as
a
general
reason
why
simply
class-of-one
analysis
should
not
apply
in
this
context,
period,
because
the
average...
whereas
the
average
in
the
regulatory
context
probably
is
a
high
degree
of
objectivity,
the
average
in
the
employment
context
is
a
relatively
high
degree
of
subjectivity
and
discretion.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
because
it's
regulatory
and
enforcing,
law
enforcement.
i
think
so.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
as
i
understand...
i
don't
know
if
you
want
me
to
try
to
restate
the
question
or
if
you
want
to
do
it.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
but,
again,
there
i
think
the...
hopefully,
the
norm
in
law
enforcement
is
a
relatively
objective
standard.
are
you
in
fact
speeding?
are
you
in
fact
breaking
the
traffic
laws?
are
you
in
fact
breaking
the
law
in
some
other
way?
whereas
the
norm
in
employment
decisions
is
a
much
more
discretionary,
subjective
kind
of
decision.
yes,
i
may
have
certain
criteria
that
i
would
prefer
a
manager
have,
but
then
i'm
still
going
to
have
to
weigh
the
qualifications
and
experience
of
various
candidates
and
ultimately
make
a
relatively
subjective
decision
about
who
i
think
is
the
best
candidate
for
that,
for
that
job.
which
is
why
we
think
the
regulatory
context
and
the
employment
context
are
significantly
different.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
well...
and
certainly
i'm
somewhat
perhaps
surprised
by
petitioner's
argument
today
because
i
understand
petitioner's
argument
to
almost
concede
the
point
that
summary
judgment
should
have
been
given
to
the...
to
the
state's
defendants
in
this
case
because
in
fact,
with
regard
to
each
of
the
three
employment
decisions
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
state
and
the
defendants
did
proffer
and--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--no.
my
answer
to
you
is
as
long...
well,
my
answer
to
you
is
twofold.
if
we're
simply
considering
whether,
in
fact,
there
could
be
such
a
thing
as
a
class-of-one
case
in
the
employment
context,
our
answer
is
no.
if
we're
past
that
and
the
issue
is
what's
the
test
to
apply,
our
test
is
as
long
as
there
is
any
conceivable
rational
basis
for
the
action
that
the
government
employer
took,
the
case
should
be
at
end;
it
should
not
go
to
the
jury.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
well,
the...
often
the
real
reason...
and
this
court
has
made
this
observation
in
particular
in
legislative
contexts.
but
often
the
real
reason
is
not
necessarily
apparent
or
undisputed,
and
beyond
that,
that's
simply
the
test
that
this
court
has
employed
as
a
general
matter
in
rational-basis
equal-protection
cases.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
well,
two
points,
your
honor.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
the
court
has
most
often,
if
not
always,
said
that
in
the
legislative
context.
but
petitioner
is
not
really
arguing
for
a
different
test
here.
as
i
understand
petitioner's
argument,
and
perhaps
i
misunderstand
it,
but
petitioner's
argument
is
that
this
court
should
apply
customary
rational-basis
analysis
and
apply
such
analysis
as
long
as
the
government
has
some
conceivable
rational
basis
that--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--agreed,
justice
ginsburg.
if...
we
don't
agree
that
that
would
be
the
test.
we
think
that
the
court
should
stick
to
the
customary
rational-basis
test
as
it's
applied
in
other
contexts,
and
say
if
there
is
any
conceivable
rational
basis,
that
even
if--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--we
would
ask
you
to
write
an
opinion,
justice
kennedy,
that
says
that,
within
the
public
employment
context,
there
are
no
class-of-one
equal
protection
claims.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
and
there--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--there
will
and
probably
are
going
to
be
other
remedies,
but
not
a
fourteenth
amendment
remedy.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
absolutely.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
not
solely.
that,
i
think,
is
a
factor.
it's
because
of,
again,
this
court's
recognition
in
other
contexts
that
public
employees
simply
are
not
on
the
same
footing
as
private
citizens
generally
with
regard
to
their
employers,
and
that
federal
court
is
simply
not
the
appropriate
forum
in
which
to
review
the
day-to-day
decisionmaking
of
public
employers;
and
because
of
recognition
of
the
inherently
subjective
nature
of
public
employment
decisions.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
i
think
so
far
as
anyone
can
determine,
he's
right
to
date.
obviously,
we
have
some
real
concern
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
there
were
such
a
cause
of
action,
that
things
might
change.
beyond
that,
i
think
the
relatively
few
number
of
cases,
and
in
particular
the
very,
very
small
to-date
number
of
successful
cases
is
an
argument
against
extending
class-of-one
equal
protection
analysis
into
this
context,
because
there
will
be
an
adverse
effect
on
public
employer
discretion
if
the
court
were
to
extend
the
analysis.
public
employers
would
have
to
worry
about
what
happened
in
this
case,
that
their
decisions
are
subject
to
later
second-guessing
in
federal
court.
it
may
well
chill
the
exercise
of
public
employer
discretion.
and
i
think
the
most
common
complaint
about
public
employer
discretion,
it
is
that
it's
underutilized
not
overutilized,
and
there
would
be
a
real
danger
that
for
the
price
of
a
very
few
successful
cases
you
would
chill
the
exercise
of
public
employer
discretion.
so,
we
actually
think
that
that
point
is
an
argument
against
the
extension,
not
for
it.
but
i
would
agree
that
we
can't
point
to
any
enormous
flood
of
cases
to
date.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
there
would
be
admittedly
very
limited
remedies
under
the
civil
service
laws,
per
se.
the
decision
about
whether
to
advance
her
as
a
manager,
of
who
would
pick
her
as
a
manager
was
one
really
solely
within
the
employer's
discretion.
with
respect
to
the
decisions
about
the
layoff
and
the
bumping
into
someone
else's
position,
she
had
essentially
what
were
procedural
remedies
under
her
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which...
which
the
union
would
have
had
to
assert
on
her
behalf.
if
the
union
had
failed
to
do
so
and
she
had
thought
the
union
erred
in
doing
so,
she
could
have
filed
an
action
against
them.
she
did
have
a
common-law
state-law
claim
in
this
case,
which
she
brought,
one
for
intentional
interference
with
her
employment
relationship,
which
she
was
successful
in
both
in
the
district
court
and
which
we
did
not
challenge
in
the
ninth
circuit.
so
that
state-law
claim
is
certainly
still
a
viable
claim--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--yes.
yes,
we
would.
although,
again,
that
provides
yet
an
additional
remedy
to--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--right.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
right.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes,
we
would.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
yes,
subject
to
whatever
limitations
there
may
be
and
other
affirmative
sources
of
law
such
as
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
some
other
state
or
federal
statutory
remedy.
yes.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
the
former...
the
former
within
the
context
of
public
employment.
we
certainly
again
are
not...
not
taking
issue
with
olech.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
well,
again
i
don't
know--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--and,
again,
i
don't
know
that
the
federal
government
discusses
peremptory
challenges,
and
i'll
leave
that
to
them.
but,
again,
stepping
outside
the
fourteenth
amendment
context
for
a
moment,
this
court
certainly
and
without
explicit
textual
support
has
recognized
the
existence,
for
example,
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees
vis-a-vis--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--but...
but...
maybe
i
shouldn't
say
again.
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
is
the
same
sort
of
line
drawing
outside
textual,
atextual
line
drawing
that
this
court
has
done
in
other
contexts
such
as
the
first
amendment
context,
where
it
has
said
that
government
simply
can
impose
obligations,
restrictions
on
its
public
employees
that
it
could
not
on
citizens
generally
and--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--and--
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
--agreed.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
not
precisely.
but
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
promote
effective
or
not
might
have
been
at
will
in
the
sense
that
was
a
decision
subject
solely
to
the
discretion
of
the
employer.
so,
in
a
sense,
it's
analogous.
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
is
precisely
at
will
with
respect
to
any
of
these
decisions.
and,
again,
because
she
had
only
limited
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
outside
of
those
limited
rights
the
employer
really
had
full
discretion
as
to
what
decision
it
would
make.
so,
again,
i
think
there
is
an
analogy
to
at
will.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
as
a
matter
of
fact,
none
of
the
assistant
attorneys
general,
including
me,
have
any
protection.
most...
most
state
employees
have
some
kind
of
collective...
i'm
arguing
against
myself
in
this
case...
most
employees
in
the
state
of
oregon
have
some
kind
of
collective
bargaining
protection.
so
at
will
is
the
exception,
not
the
rule.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
not
precisely.
it's
much
more
a
matter
of
collective
bargaining,
but
it
amounts
to
much
the
same
thing
in
the
end.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
absolutely.
and
i
would
readily
concede
that
fact.
if
the
court
gets
to
the
second
part
of
the
case
and
the
question
becomes
what
sort
of
test,
assuming
that
the
court
finds
a
class-of-one
analysis
should
apply
in
this
context
and
the
question
becomes:
what's
the
test?
really,
all
the
state
is
asking
for
here
is
an
application
of
the
customary,
rational-basis
test
in
which
if
any
conceivable
rational
basis
can
be
offered
by
the
government,
the
case
should
be
at
an
end.
that
position
was
raised
below
by
the
state
defendants,
who
raised
the
point
both
in
their
summary
judgment
motion
and
in
their
trial
memo
and
urged
the
district
court
to
take
this
case
away
from
the
jury
on
that
basis,
and
the
district
court
refused
to
do
so.
ms.
janet
a.
metcalf
i
think
the
difference
is
not
that
great.
i
think,
admittedly,
the
actual
rationale
is
harder
to
discern
in
legislative
cases,
in
part,
because
you
have
so
many
decisionmakers.
but
here,
for
example,
it
is
similar
because
the
decisionmakers
might
have
had
a
number,
and
probably
did
have
a
number,
of
elements
in
mind
from
dislike
to
a
preference
for
a
certain
kind
of
background.
thank
you.
