justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
he
didn't
like
him?
i'm
the
supervisor;
i
didn't
like
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
you
say
related.
if
the
truth
is
i
don't
like
this
person,
good-bye,
now,
is
that
rational?
when
you
say...
i
mean,
you
know
as
much
about
the
case
now
as
i
do...
not
this
case
but,
you
know,
that's
all
we
know.
is
that
rational
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
problem,
that
either...
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
you're
either
going
to
say
rational
in
these
circumstances,
which
means
you
go
into
it
whether
the
time
sheet
was
this
or
whether
it
was
that
or
the
other;
or
you
say,
hey,
it's
always
rational
because
he
could
have
fired
him
because
he
doesn't
like
the
person.
that's...
and
i
don't
see
some
intermediate
step
there.
to
put
the
question
differently,
every
government
has
a,
state
and
federal,
has
an
administrative
procedures
act.
that
forbids
unreasonable,
arbitrary
action.
but
why
do
they
need
that
if
the
constitution
does
it
by
itself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
that's...
that's
why
i
started
this.
i
read
through,
at
least
briefly,
the
circuit
cases
in
this
area.
i
was
trying
to
figure
it
out.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
those
circuit
cases
just
really
are
finding
some
reason
to
dismiss
the
employee's
claim,
that
they
are
not
taking
this
seriously,
that
is...
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
criticize
them
because
i
don't
know
the
facts
of
the
case;
but
i
couldn't
figure
out
a
standard.
and
then
i
thought,
well,
the
standard
has
to
be
the
apa
standard,
and
if
it's...
i
know
that
standard.
and
the
reason
that
you
don't
have
a
million
cases
under
that
standard
is
because
states
have
civil
service
systems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
seemed
to
me
that's
the
standard
you
want
to
apply.
you
want
to
bring
all
those
cases
into
federal
court,
and
i'm
not
sure
they
are
doing
it
now,
really,
in
practice.
now
what's
wrong
with
what
i've
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
you
could...
you
could
take
sentiment...
i
thought
you
could
break
the
cases,
for
the
most
part,
into
two
parts;
one,
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
and
that's
where
the
real
reason
is
some
kind
of
general
characteristic,
of
a
disfavored
group.
the
second
is
the
instance
where
the...
where
the
body
that's
acting
is
a
body
whose
business
it
is
to
classify.
that's
zoning,
taxation,
and
it
means
really
classifying
in
fact,
not
some
theoretical
thing
where
you
say,
oh,
well,
they're
classifying
it
employment
because
they
put
you
in
the
class
of
such
and
such.
but
those
two
seem
to
me
to
handle
the
bulk
of
the
cases,
which,
if
i'm
right
about
that,
would
leave
your
client
out
in
the
cold.
so
i
assume
you'll
tell
me
why
i'm
not
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
think
the
answer
is
yes,
i
mean,
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
the
administrative
procedures
act
forbids
arbitrary,
capricious
action.
so
you're
saying
the
constitution--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--does
not
constitutionalize
all--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--arbitrary,
capricious
behavior--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
federal--
government--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
the
state
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
is
yes.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
wondered
if
i
was
right,
you
know;
that
i
thought
that
maybe,
looking
back,
that
there
is
something
about
zoning
and
taxation
where
it
normally
is
alleged
that
it's
rule-making
activity.
and
that
perhaps
you
would
apply
all
of
these
things
you
are
talking
about
where
what
the...
even
if
it
is
employment,
where
what
the
employer
is
doing,
or
anyone
else
is
doing,
is
creating
rules,
is
classifying.
and
not
a
made-up
classification
like
you
put
me
and
one
other
fired
person
in
the
fired-person
category.
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
like
taxation
and
zoning
and
legislation.
is
there
anything
to
that?
