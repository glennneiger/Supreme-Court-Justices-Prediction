justice
antonin
scalia
rational-basis
review
normally
doesn't
inquire
into
the
actual
motive,
for
example,
of
the
state
legislators
who
impose
such
a
tax
or
impose
such
a
restriction.
we
simply
ask:
could
there
have
been
a
rational
basis
for
this?
now,
are
you
willing
to
abide
by
that
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
listen
to
what
i'm
saying.
not
whether
you
could
decide
that,
given
all
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
criticism
of
the
co-workers
and
all
of
that,
whether
it
is
conceivable
to
say
that
this
was
done
on
a
rational
basis.
that
isn't
the
rational-basis
test.
it's
just
sitting
back
without
these
factual
inquiries,
just
as
we
don't
inquire
factually
into
why
the
state
legislature
acted,
just
asking:
could
there
have
been
a
rational
basis
for
the
dismissal
of
this
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
not
working
with
this
person;
he
is
not
going
to
affect
my
efficiency.
he's
under
somebody
below
me
but
i
just
don't
like
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
government...
suppose
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
we
don't
want
to
take
a
position
as
to...
as
to
what
the
reason
was;
it
could
have
been
any
one
of
the
following
seven...
you
know,
the
wheat
market
collapsed;
she
came
in
late
five
days;
some
of
the
jobs
she
did
she
didn't
do
well;
she
dressed
inappropriately
on
the
job;
her
co-workers
didn't
like
they
are...
you
know.
and...
can
the
government
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
far...
does
it
have
to
pick
a
reason?
you're...
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long
as
there
is
conceivable
reason,
the
court
would
grant
summary
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
those
facts
are
true
facts,
but
the
government
isn't
claiming
that
any
one
of
them
was
the
reason.
it
just
says
here
are
the
conceivable
reasons
why...
why
she
might
have
been
fired.
we
really
don't
know
which
one
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
are
seven
perfectly
conceivable
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
to
negate
it?
to
negate
it
as
the
actual
reason
is
what
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
is
not
purporting
that...
to
say
that
it's
the
actual
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
saying
had
she
been
dismissed
for
this
reason,
and
we
really
don't
know
whether
that
was
the
reason
or
not,
but
had
she
been
dismissed
for
this
reason
it
would
have
been
rational.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
didn't
understand
your
position
to
be
that,
but
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
but
we
have
said
that...
that
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
if
the
reason
the
person
was
not
hired
is
that
the
person
did
not
belong
to
the
political
party
that
the...
that
the
hiring
person
belonged
to,
the
current
administration.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
you
can't
turn
down
somebody
just
because
she's
a
democrat
or
a
republican.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
far
as
the
federal
law
claim
is
concerned,
you'd
urge
us
to
come
out
the
same
way,
even
if
this
case
came
up
before
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
as
to
federal
employment,
you'd
say
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
say
the
same
as
if
there
were
no
state
remedies
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--employment
discrimination
by
the
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
state
has
a
right
to
employ
at
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
simply
say
that
they
are
not
being
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law?
the
law
that
applies
to
her
and
to
everybody
else
employed
by
the
government
is
that
the
employment
is
at
will?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
certainly
an
equal
protection.
she
could
be
fired
at
will
and
everybody
else
can
be
fired
at
will.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
equal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
talk
about
equal
protection,
actually,
it
talks
about
equal
protection
the
law;
and
if...
if
the
law
in
the
government
employment
context
is
that
you
can
be
dismissed
at
will,
or
for
a
number
of
reasons,
so
long
as
everybody
is
subject
to
that
same
law,
it
would
seem
to
be
no
discrimination
in
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
don't
rely
on
the
text,
certainly.
