justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
happens
in
this
situation?
the
government
gives
a
reason
for
whatever
the
adverse
action
is.
somebody...
they
give...
and
let's
say
a
person
had
lower
performance
ratings
than
another
person
who
was
retained
or
given
promotion.
your
position
is
the
employee
can
always
contest
that
and
say
that's
not
the
real
reason;
that's
not
factually
supported;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
is
it
extremely
deferential
when
the
employee
is
going
to
say
that's
not
the
real
reason;
the
real
reason
was
simply
spite
and
animus
and
personal
dislike?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
that
goes
before
the
jury.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
employee
says...
look,
it
seems
to
me,
the
employee
says
in
an
affidavit
the
supervisor
doesn't
like
me,
and
here
are
the
20
things
that
the
supervisor
has
done
and
said
over
the
course
of
the
last
five
years
to
indicate
personal
dislike.
then...
then
it
goes
to
the
jury.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
there
are
areas
outside
of
employment
where
there's
a
lot
of
discretion.
suppose
someone
claims
that
he
has
repeatedly
gotten
speeding
tickets
for
going
five
miles
over
the
speed
limit
by
a
local
police
department
because
of
some
sort
of
personal
feud
with
the
chief
of
police.
that
i
take
it
would
be
a
valid
claim
under
olech
because
it's
outside
his
employment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
question
was:
don't
you
run
into
the
same
problem
of
discretion
outside
of
the
employment
context?
for
example,
a
police
officer
who
is
alleged
to
have
given
someone
a
ticket
or
a
number
of
tickets
simply
because
of
personal
malice
as
opposed
to
some
sort
of
uniform
policy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
keep
stressing
the
text
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
don't
you
think
it's
late
in
the
day
to
be
arguing
that
equal
protection
clause
should
be
read
with
that
kind
of
literalness?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
talks
about
laws,
but
it
extends
to
situations
where
what's
being...
the
unequal
treatment
is
not
stemming
from
the
law,
but
from
executive
or
administrative
action.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
in
the
other
example,
are
there
not
situations
where
it's
been
held
to
apply
that
might
not
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
in
all
other
respects
it's
read
literally?
