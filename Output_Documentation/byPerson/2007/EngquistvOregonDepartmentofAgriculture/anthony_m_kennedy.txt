justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
you
begin
with
the
proposition
that
the
government
must
always
have
a
reason
for
what
it
does?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
a
national
for-cause
employment
system.
you
can
only
be
hired
for
cause...
fired
for
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
getting
back
to
the
point
the
government
must
always
have
a
reason
for
what
it
does.
can
you
cite
me
a
case
that
says
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
must
always
have
a
reason
for
the
actions
it
takes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
those
are
all
tax
cases,
or
in
olech,
30
feet
as
opposed
to
15
feet,
where
there
was
a
clear
difference
that
was
not...
but
there
was
also
an
allegation
of
an
invidious
motive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
hard
for
me
to
get
that
sweeping
provision
out
of
olech.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
olech
was
wrongly
decided?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
find
anything
in
olech
that
says
that
every
action
that
does
not
have
a
reason
is
constitutionally
infirm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
olech
was
correctly
decided?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
public
employment
is
different
just
because
it's
going
to
be
a
big
problem?
what--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
we're
presuming
that
there
is
an
objective
reason
for
promoting
or
retaining...
the
person
has
a
college
degree
and
so
forth...
but
that
that
person
is
rejected
anyway
because
of
dislike.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
hypothetical.
why
is
that
hypothetical
case
different
than
olech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
we
say
that
there
is
a
subset
of
unusual
cases
where
we
will
allow
the
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
having
trouble
hearing
both
the
question
and
the
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
concerned
about
the
case...
let's
just
assume,
just
take
it
as
a
hypothetical
case...
where
there
is
an
arbitrary
and
vindictive
reason
for
hiring
the
employee
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
race,
sex,
or
other
recognized
suspect
or
improper
categories.
and
i
thought
your
answer
to
me
was,
well,
i
might
make
an
exception
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
that
says
there
are
some
instances
where
the
government
can
act
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
because
of
existence
of
other
avenues
of
redress.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understood
that
the
argument--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
what
authority
do
you
have
for
us
to
parse
different
governmental
actions
and
say
some
are
subject
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
some
are
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
the
convenience
of
the
government...
it
might
be
more
efficient
for
the
government...
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
government
can
act
arbitrarily
with
respect
to
employees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ma'am,
the
reason
that
we
didn't
say
that
same
thing
in
oleck
is
because
in
the
taxation
area
or
the
easement
area
we
simply
don't
have
the
great
number
of
cases
and
also
because
animus
is
more
easily
established.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
a
public
employee
applies
for
a
30-foot
easement
that
he
is
entitled
to,
and
doesn't
receive
it;
and
the
mayor
says
and
by
the
way
i
don't
like
you,
so
you're
fired:
a,
you
don't
get
the
easement,
b,
you're
fired.
why...
why
do
we
treat
the
cases
differently?
other
than
the
floodgate
argument
etcetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
just
states
your
conclusion.
i
want
to
know
why
this
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
should
cite
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
be
a
policeman?
we
can
revise
that?
