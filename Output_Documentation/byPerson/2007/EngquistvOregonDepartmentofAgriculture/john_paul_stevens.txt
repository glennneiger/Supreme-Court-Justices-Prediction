let
me
ask,
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
question:
suppose
it's
not
a
class-of-one,
but
it's
a
class
of
two
or
three
because,
on
two
or
three
occasions
they
fired
somebody
because
he
wouldn't
pay
the
supervisor
a
bribe.
would
that
cross
the
threshold?
he
had
a
practice
of
not...
you
know,
getting
a
little
money
out
of
every
promotion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it's
not
a
class
of
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
say
no
or
yes
to
whether
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
those
are
all
considerations
that
would
be
an
adequate
defense
to
a
claim.
if
you
had
a
judgment
call
to
make,
you
say,
i
had
a
judgment
call
to
make.
and
maybe
there
are
good
arguments
on
the
other
side.
you
can't
be
liable
for
that
kind
of
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
opponent's
statement
that
this
really
has
not
generated
an
awful
lot
of
litigation.
do
you
think
he's
right
or
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
proportion
of
your
workforce
is
really
hired
at
will?
haven't
they
all
got
some
kind
of
protections
under
your
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
have
you
some
kind
of
civil
service
system,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
implies
people
who
are
employed
at
will
are
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
mixed
motives
case,
both
ill
will
and
a...
some
reason,
she
was
also
late
to
work...
you
would
win
that
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
one
good
reason
and
one
bad
reason,
the
bad
reason
doesn't
trump
the
good
reason.
