justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
the
rationale
not
apply
in
that
situation?
are
you
accepting
the
proposition
that
anybody
who's
arrested
for
a
tax
offense
is
not
a
danger
to
the
arresting
officer?
haven't
there
been
some
pretty
dangerous
people
arrested
over
the
years
for
tax
offenses?
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

well,
why
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
something
that's
prohibited
by
a
statute,
something
that's
prohibited
by
a
local
ordnance
or
let's
say
it's
a
directive
of
the
police
department?
and
if
it's...
if
the
arrest
is
contrary
to
any
of
those
things,
it's
unlawful
under
state
law,
is
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
your
argument
that
if
the
arrest
is
unlawful
under
state
law
it's
an
unreasonable
search,
an
unreasonable
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
virginia
has
a
statute
that
said
it's
unlawful
to
arrest
for
a
traffic
violation,
but
that
it
is
lawful
under
virginia
law
for
an
officer
to
conduct
a
search
incident
to
any
arrest,
whether
it's
lawful
under
virginia
law
or
not?
would
we
follow
that
latter
virginia
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
law
and
in
effect
what
virginia
has
in
place?
they
say
the
arrest
is
unlawful,
but
they
don't
provide
for
the
exclusion
of
evidence
that's
obtained
as
a
result
of
that
arrest
under
virginia
law.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
johnson,
the
search
was
illegal
because
they
illegally
entered
the
hotel
room.
isn't
that
right?
so
it
didn't
matter
what
happened
after
that
point.
