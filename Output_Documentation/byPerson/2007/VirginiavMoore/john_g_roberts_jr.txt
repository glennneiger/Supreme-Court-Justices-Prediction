chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
06-1082,
virginia
v.
moore.
mr.
mccullough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mccullough--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
suppose
it
works
the
other
way.
if
virginia
has
a
law
saying
you
can
arrest
anybody
you
want
on
our
highways,
but,
you
know,
here's
what
the
offenses
are,
the
officers
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
think
a
crime
had
been
committed,
but
it
was
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest,
i
suppose
under
the
respondent's
theory
that
would
be
all
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it's
questioned
in
your
footnote
13
in
your
brief.
you
seem
to
suggest
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so...
so
we
should
write
an
opinion
saying
we're
not
saying
that
it
was
correct
to...
we're
not
saying
that
it
was
correct
to
exclude
the
evidence
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
says
the
laws
of
the
50
states
are
pretty
variable
on
this
question
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
we
have
to
look
at
both
of
those
varieties?
let's
say
the
state
has
a
rule
that,
yes,
you
can
arrest
people
in
a
way
that
we
would
say
you
can't,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
probable
cause.
you
just
have
to...
they're
just
arrestable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
probable
cause
to
arrest.
the
state
has
a
law
that
says
you
can
arrest
in
these
circumstances
whether
or
not
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
it
has
to
be
sufficient
cause
to
arrest,
not
sufficient
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
is,
as
your
friends
on
the
other
side
put
it,
you
are
advocating
a
two-step
process.
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
there
has
to
be
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
they're
different
here.
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed,
but
you
say
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
because
state
law
makes
it
illegal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
state
makes
a
trivial
offense
arrestable,
as
in
atwater?
you're
suggesting
in
that
situation
the
common
law
rule
we
have
doesn't
apply.
it's
a
trivial
offense,
but
it's
made
arrestable
and
therefore
it
doesn't
violate
the
fourth
amendment
to
search
incident
to
that
arrest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
legislature...
this
was
the
hypothetical
mr.
dreeben
posed.
what
if
the
legislature
says
yes,
you
can
arrest
for
this
offense
but
you
cannot
search
incident
to
the
arrest,
because
we
think
that's
too
much
of
an
intrusion
given
the
fact
that
it's
a
relatively
trivial
offense?
in
that
case,
would
our
doctrine
saying
under
the
fourth
amendment
you
can
search
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
be
reversed
preempted,
preempted
by
the
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
state
can
define
the
circumstances
under
which
you
can
have
an
arrest,
but
the
state
can't
define
and
limit
the
consequences
of
the
arrest?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
can
i
get
back
to
your
discussion
of
cooper?
in
cooper,
you
said
that
if
it
violates
the
state
law
for
an
inventory
search,
then
you
can't
search
incident
to
that.
but
that's
because
it
is
then
not
an
inventory
search.
here
there's
no
doubt
that
this
was
an
arrest,
whether
it
complied
with
state
law
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
just...
it
gets
to...
i
mean,
if
you
don't
follow
the
state
rules,
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
rules
for
an
inventory
search.
but
here
you're
saying
if
don't...
you're
not
saying
if
you
don't
follow
the
state
rules,
it's
not
an
arrest.
it's
not
a
lawful
arrest.
but
that's
a
different
question
than
whether
or
not
it
is
an
arrest.
our
precedents
say
if
it's
an
arrest,
you
can
search
incident
to
the
arrest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
we
assume,
contrary
to
your
footnote
13,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
implicated
in
this
case,
could
you
explain
why,
under
the
federal
constitution,
there
should
be
imposed
on
the
state
an
exclusionary
rule
for
a
violation
of
state
law
when
state
law
does
not
impose
an
exclusionary
rule
for
the
violation
of
its
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the
question
would
be:
why
doesn't
our
jurisprudence
on
whether
there's
an
arrest
also
look
to
something
else,
rather
than
whether
it's
permitted
or
violated
under
state
law?
in
other
words,
the
state
doesn't...
the
state
law
does
not
provide
for
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
we
say
the
fourth
amendment
does.
under...
this
is
not
a
valid
arrest
under
state
law,
but
your
brothers
say
under
the
fourth
amendment
it
is
because
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
your
friend
agreed
that
the
cases
didn't
establish
whether
our
references
to
probable
cause
meant
to
probable
cause
to
arrest
or
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed.
you
don't
agree
with
that?
do
you
think
that
the
cases
foreclose
their
position?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.
mr.
mccullough,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
