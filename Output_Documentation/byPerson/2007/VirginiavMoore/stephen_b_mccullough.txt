mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
again
and
again
held
that
an
arrest
is
constitutionally
reasonable
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
suspect
has
committed
a
crime.
the
court
has
found
that
this
standard
represents
the
best
compromise
between
the
needs
of
the
citizens
and
the
duty
of
the
government
to
combat
crime.
while
the
states
are
free
to
build
additional
procedures
on
this
constitutional
bedrock,
when
they
do
so
these
additional
procedures
are
matters
of
state
law.
they
do
not
change
the
constitutional
standard.
the
court
below
erred
in
substituting
this
clear,
established,
uniform,
time-tested
standard
for
a
standard
that
has
none
of
those
virtues.
first,
it
is
undeniable
that
if
state
law
can
raise
the
constitutional
bar,
that
it
will
lead
to
widespread
differences
on
the
exact
same
facts,
on
the
exact
same
crime,
not
only
across
state
lines,
but
also
within
a
particular
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
that's
correct.
if
he
had
issued
a
summons,
knowles
would
apply
and
the
evidence
would
be
excluded.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
your
honor,
the
rationale
of
knowles
was
that
the
officer
did
not
engage
in
any
extended
contact
with
the
suspect
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
gather
evidence.
but
where
from
a
constitutional
sense
there
is
a
full-fledged
arrest,
then
the
particular
rationale
of
knowles
doesn't
apply;
and
i
don't
think
the...
we're
asking
the
court
to
embrace
violations
of
state
law;
we're
asking
the
court
to
recognize
that
when
a
state
goes
above
and
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires,
that
the
remedies
for
those
violations
should
be
left
to
the
states.
and
virginia
has
provided
a
number
of
those
remedies;
but
here
the
officer
did
make
a
full
custodial
arrest.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
no.
there
was
a
miscommunication
between
the
officers--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--no.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
your
honor,
the
fact
of
the
arrest
was
uncontested,
and
the
law
doesn't
require--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
justice
stevens,
the
search
was
related
to
the
arrest.
what
happened
at
the
scene
was
the
officer
made
a
pat-down
and
assumed
the
other
officer
had
conducted
the
search.
when
they
got
to
the
hotel,
they
realized
there
had
been
a
mix-up.
but
he
had
not
yet
been
taken
to
the
station
and
booked
and
so
the
rationale
supporting
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
is
present.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
the
arrest
did
not
cease
at
that
point,
your
honor.
in
united
states
v.
edwards,
the
court
recognized
that
at
times
the
search
will
not
proceed
immediately
upon
arrest.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
well,
it's
an
arrest--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--it's
an
arrest
until
he
is
released
or
denied
bail.
but
i
would
also
add
that
the
timing
issue
was
simply
not
raised
below.
and
so
there's
no
reason
at
this
juncture
to
raise
an
issue
that
the
litigants
chose
not
to--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--if
there
is
state
action--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--if
you
have
state
actors--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--that's
not
a
smart
neighbor.
[laughter]
if
you
have
state
action
and
you
enter
into
someone's
home,
then
the
constitution
affords
a
heightened
level
of
protection.
but--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--i
don't
think
the
fact
of...
no.
the
fact
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--so
long--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
i
think
if
there
is
state
action,
it
doesn't
matter
that
you're
wearing
a
badge
or
that
you've
gone
through
the
police
academy.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
i
think
that's
right.
that
if
you
have...
if
the
state--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--your
honor--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--i
think
if
he's
doing
it
on
behalf
of
the
state,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
but
in
terms
of
the
federal-state
distinction,
your
honor,
i
think
what
we're
advocating
for
is
the
uniform
standard
that
this
court
has
embraced
before,
that
there
should
not
be
a
difference
between
a
federal
officer
on
a
state
facility
who
is
authorized
under
the
assimilated
crimes
act
to
arrest
for
virginia
laws
and
a
virginia
officer
who
is
a
hundred
feet
away
with
making
an
unconstitutional
arrest
under
the
holding
below
when--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--your
honor--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--that's
right.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
well,
the
state
court
found
there
was
no...
none
of
the
exceptions
in
the
statute
applied.
but
when
the
court
has
used
the
term
"probable
cause
to
arrest",
it
has
never
required
a
two-step
analysis
of,
first,
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
had
been
committed,
and
then
probable
cause
to
arrest.
it's
always
been,
in
this
court's
cases,
a
single
inquiry:
has
there
been
probable
cause?
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
he
could
have,
but
it
would
have
caused
a
prolonged
detention
of
the
suspect.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
well--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--your
honor,
it
is
an
arrestable
offense
under
certain
circumstances.
and
so
the
officer
is
left
with
each
arrest
to
make
a
discretionary
call.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
the
officers
did
not...
their
only
testimony
was
it
was
their
prerogative.
and
unfortunately
they
did
not
then
unpack
that
explanation
to
say
why
they
thought
one
of
the
exceptions
applied.
what
the
state
argued
below
and
the
state
court
rejected
was
that
he
was
alone
in
a
car
with
this
large
angry
dog.
there
was
no
passenger
that
he
could
switch
places
with,
and
so
if
they
write
him
a
summons,
logically,
what
is
he
going
to
do?
he
doesn't
live
anywhere
nearby.
as
soon
as
they
leave
the
scene,
he's
going
to
get
right
back
in
his
car
and
drive
away.
now
the
state
court
rejected
that,
but
that
illustrates
the
fact
that
under
this
statute
the
officers
have
to
make
discretionary
calls
as
to
when
these
exceptions
apply.
is
the
defendant--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--your--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--well,
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
let
the
states
regulate
this
arrest
authority.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
all
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
affirm
the
probable
cause
standard
that
has...
without
any
further
balancing,
that
the
balancing
has
occurred
when--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--no,
i'm
simply
explain...
what
i
was
trying
to
so
was
to
explain
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
these
officers
have
to
make
these
discretionary
calls.
if
that
then
becomes
the
constitutional
standard,
that
instead
of
a
simple
probable
cause
finding
you
have
to
get
into
every
discretionary
call
by
the
officer,
that
it...
it
turns
actually--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--no,
your
honor.
that
was
adversely
litigated
against
us
in
the
state
court.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
well...
but
the
problem
is,
if
the
standard
then
becomes
a
two-step
probable
cause,
where
we
have
to
figure
out
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
whether
the
officer
guessed
right
in
terms
of
one
of
these
exceptions,
then
every
discretionary
judgment
in
the
field
becomes
the
occasion
for
constitutional--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--it...
i
mean,
it
certainly
would
flow
from
that.
so
i
think,
given
the
multitude--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--the
search
incident
to
arrest
is
a
bright-line
rule,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
promulgated
in
robinson.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
i'm
sorry.
yes,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
if
a
crime
has
been
committed
the
bright-line
rule
permits
the
officer
to
search
the
suspect
for
officer
safety
as
well
as--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--what
the...
yes,
because
what
the
court
said
in
robinson
was:
we're
not
interested
in
delving
into
case-by-case
litigation
as
to
how
dangerous
this
person
was
and
how...
and
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
of
evidence
being
found--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--i
agree
with
that.
i'm
arguing
that
it's
a
bright-line
rule
and
that
if
someone
is
arrested
for
a
crime,
tax
or
otherwise,
it's
not
the
nature
of
the
crime--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
this
court
has
crafted
a
bright-line
rule...
it
has
not
distinguished
between
types
of
offenses;
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
violent
offense;
it
could
be
a
white-collar
offense...
that
across
the
board
there
is
virtue
to
having
this
bright-line
rule
that
permits
the
officer
to
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
and
in
robinson
the
court
noted
that
a
lawful
arrest
is
a...
that
it
met
a
constitutionally
lawful
arrest,
one
made
with
probable
cause.
this
arrest
was
made
with
probable
cause.
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
was
lawful.
i
would
ask
the
court
if
i
could
keep
my
remaining
time.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
thank
you.
first,
when
counsel
says
that
this
is
some
kind
of
a
unique
virginia
statute,
that's
wrong.
the
brief
filed
by
the
aba
shows
that
all
but
nine
states
have
enacted
provisions
that
are
similar,
that
involve
restrictions
on
their
officers'
authority,
and
each
of
those
has
exceptions,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
so
it
is
not
a
unique
situation.
you
have
clear
rules.
why
would
you
trade
them
in
for
a
morass?
an
arrest
is
constitutional
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
has
been
committed.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
that's
right.
in
the
case--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--that's
correct.
in
atwater,
a
jaywalking
arrest
is
constitutionally
permissible.
atwater
did
not
reach
the
in-the-presence
question,
and
it
is
not
presented
here
because
the
offense
occurred
in
the
officer's
presence.
so--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--no.
i
think...
we
relied
on
greenwood,
and
so
i--
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
--i
don't
have
an
explanation
for
that.
we
certainly
think
it
strongly...
as
the
united
states
points
out
in
their
brief,
that
it
strongly
supports
our
position.
and
as
the
lower
courts
have
noted
when
facing
a
similar
argument,
you've
already
held
that
when
it
comes
to
a
search,
that
under
greenwood
and
cooper,
that
state-law
considerations
aren't
going
to
be
what
the
constitutional
inquiry
turns
on.
why
would
you
have
this
incongruity
where
that's
true
in
greenwood
and
cooper
with
a
search
of
a
residence
or
an
automobile
but
then
you
have
a
different
rule
when
it
comes
to
an
arrest?
the
states
have
been
handling
this
problem,
but
it's
an
issue
of
state
law.
and
the
state
here
has
never
held,
going
back
to
1924,
that
a
violation
of
state
law
rises
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
arrest
and...
or,
excuse
me...
that...
let
me
restate
that.
that
a
violation
of
state
law
warrants
the
exclusionary
rule
at
the
state
level.
so
when
the
legislature
enacted
this,
they
contemplated
that
specific
set
of
remedies.
so,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
we
just
ask
the
court
to
adhere
to
its
jurisprudence;
that
the
arrest
is
constitutional
because
it
is
made
with
probable
cause.
there
was
a
violation
of
state
law,
but
it
wasn't
a
constitutional
problem.
and
so
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
that
is
used
with
some
frequency,
and
we
certainly
saw
an
increase
in
the
wake
of
the
moore
decision.
i
can't
go
county
by
county
and
city
by
city,
but
it
has
common
currency.
and
one
example
is
portsmouth
evidently,
although
it
is
not
clear...
we
have
gotten
conflicting
answers.
when
mr.
moore
was
arrested,
there
is
no
such
order.
but
a
few
miles
down
the
road
the
city
of
virginia
beach
does
have
such
an
order.
and
this
just
shows
the
complexities
the
court
would
be
stepping
in
where,
if
mr.
moore
is
arrested
in
portsmouth
for
the
exact
same
crime
on
the
exact
same
facts,
it
is
unconstitutional
under
moore's
rule.
but
he
goes
a
few
miles
down
the
road
to
the
city
of
virginia
beach,
and
the
arrest
is
perfectly
constitutional
because
the
district
court
has
entered
such
an
order.
and
it
just
doesn't
make
sense,
as
the
court
noted
in
whren,
for
constitutional
provisions
to
be
so
variable.
mr.
stephen
b.
mccullough
the
statute...
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
the
statute
at
issue,
46.2-936,
does
not
really
lay
out
particular
criteria.
so
it
is...
and
the
issue
hasn't
been
litigated
in
the
virginia
courts
as
to
the
criteria
that's
required.
but
it
seems
to
be
broad
discretion
by
the
general
district
judge.
