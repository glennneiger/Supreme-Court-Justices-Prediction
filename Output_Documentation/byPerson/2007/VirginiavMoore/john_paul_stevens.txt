justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
he
made
a
custodial
arrest.
did
he
search
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
he
search
him
at
the
place
of
the
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
this
be
incident
to
an
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
search
is
unrelated
to
the
arrest,
as
i
understand
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
took
place
later
in
a
different
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
it
present
if
he's
not...
he
searched
when
he
wasn't
arrested?
i
don't
understand.
could
they
wait
a
week
and
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
an
ongoing
arrest,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
incident
to
an
ongoing
arrest?
that's
kind
of
a
new
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
this
question:
you
would
argue
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
violated
state
or
federal
law;
it's
a
question
of
federal
law
on
probable
cause.
but
does
the
character
of
the
crime
for
which
the
person
is
being
arrested
have
any
relevance
to
the
question
whether
the
search
is
reasonable?
for
example,
supposing
he
is
arrested
for
a
tax
offense;
could
you
go
ahead
and
search
him
incident
to
that
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes,
they
could
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
rationale
for
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doesn't
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
that
analysis,
it
seems
to
you
we
rely
on
the
citizen's
expectation
of
privacy
as
the
justification.
and
i
think
justice
kennedy
makes
a
rather
strong
response
to
that,
because
it's
unrealistic
to
assume
that
a
citizen
in
certain
counties
in
virginia
had
such
an
expectation
but
did
not
in
other
counties,
because
most
citizens
don't
know
the
sophisticated
aspects
of
the
virginia
law.
