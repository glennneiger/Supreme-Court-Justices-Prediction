mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
notion
that
the
proud
men
who
framed
the
constitution
would
believe
it
reasonable
to
go
out
and
arrest
someone
for
a
non-arrestable
offense
and
not
only
do
that,
but
having
committed
that
trespass
at
common
law,
to
further
search
them,
is
i
think
an
extreme
proposition
and
one
that
they
would
not
have
accepted.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
your
honor,
i
do--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
your
honor,
i
disagree,
for
the
reason
that...
and
there
are
obviously...
i'm
not
here
to
tell
the
court
what
its
own
precedents
mean.
but
atwater
makes
quite
clear
that
at
common
law
this
was
something
that
was
subject
to
legislate
ive
override,
and
that's
what
was
reasonable
at
common
law
when
the
constitution
was
framed.
and
that
is,
legislatures
sometimes
said
that
you
could
arrest
and
sometimes
said
that
you
couldn't.
but
two
things
were
undisputable,
i
think,
and
that
is
when
you
did
arrest
illegally
that
was
unreasonable--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
for
a
few
reasons.
first,
virginia
does
take
this
quite
seriously.
the
officer
can
be
fired
for
violating
the
statute.
that's
no
small
thing.
the
second
is
i
wouldn't
assume
that
virginia
believes
and
the
virginia
legislature
believed
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
suppressed,
because
for
reasons
that
i'll
explain
in
a
minute
the
virginia
legislature
was
triggering
a
long
line
of
its
court
cases
that
say
if
you
arrest
someone
for
a
non-arrestable
offense,
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated,
and
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
has
never
been
questioned
in
that
context.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
right.
i
don't
question
its
application,
but
neither
does
virginia,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's...
i
think
that
that's
right.
that
also
happened
in
california
v.
greenwood,
you
may
recall,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
there
was
some
discussion
at
oral
argument
about
would
we
believe
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
here.
that
question
had
not
been
preserved.
that
case
is
on
remand
in
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
whren
is
different
in
several
different
ways.
the
first
is
that
that
was
a
challenge
to
the
stop,
not
the
search
incident
to
arrest.
the
claim
was
that
the
officers
under
a
local
d.c.
government
regulation
did
not
have
the
power
to
make
a
traffic
stop
because
there
was
a
local
regulation
that
said
if
you're
not
in
uniform
and
if
you're
not
in
a
police
car,
a
marked
car,
you
shouldn't
make
those
traffic
stops.
so,
it's
different
on
a
couple
of
different
actions.
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
challenge,
the
nature
of
the
law
that's
being
evoked,
the
local
regulation
rather
than
legislation,
i
think,
are
the
principal
ones.
here
we're
dealing
with
something
quite
fundamental,
and
i
haven't
gotten
to
this
court's
precedents
applying
the
common
law
rule
that
i
described
at
the
beginning,
so
if
i
could
do
and
then
compare
whren.
post...
define
the
common
law,
every
since
weeks,
which
is
the
first
case
of
this
court
to
recognize
the
search
incident
arrest
exception,
all
the
way
through
di
re,
miller,
johnson,
ker,
defillippo,
those
are
five
cases
that
confront
the
question
in
this
case,
i
believe
that
genuinely
confront
it;
is
not
dictum,
it
is
holding.
those
cases
confront
the
question:
can
you
have
a
constitutional
search
incident
to
an
illegal
arrest?
illegal
there
not
being
unconstitutional,
but
a
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
court
hasn't
ever
confronted
that
question.
the
places...
the
line
of
cases
that
i
described
were
one
of
two
things,
positive
state
legislation
enacted
by
the
legislature
or
common
law.
it
has
never
dealt
with
the
locality
question.
whren
suggests
that
maybe
a
local
police
regulation
is
too
variable.
we
would
win
under
either
rule.
the...
i
think
the
core
reason
you
would
draw
the
line
at
legislation
is
because
this...
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
just
an
instrumental
thing
designed
to
do
good.
it
is,
as
designed,
to
apply
common
law
concepts
of
reasonableness,
which
was
the
foundation--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
and
your
question,
justice
alito,
is
designed
to
test
what
i
mean
by
unlawful
in
terms
of
what
sources...
the
state
constitution,
legislation,
local
police
practices.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
if
i
have
conveyed
that
impression,
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
intend
to.
our
rule
is
that
if
it's
unlawful.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
court
could
conclude
that
local
police
regulations,
for
example,
are
too
variable
to...
and
whren
calls
them
"trivialities",
so
we
won't
pick
them
up.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
as
are
the
laws
of
whether
it's
a
crime
at
all,
as
are
under
indianapolis
v.
edmund
and
lots
of
other
cases
where
the
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
you
have
to
have
probable
cases
to
arrest.
cases
like
berkemer,
seth--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
sorry.
by
that
phrase
i
mean
there
is
a
constitutional
component.
part
of
the
constitutional
floor
is
that
you
have
to
have
sufficient
cause.
that's
a
guarantee
of
the
fourth
amendment.
this
court's
cases
make
clear
you
can't
go
below--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
necessary
but
not
a
sufficient
condition,
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
obviously
a...
the
constitutional
floor
includes
the
element
of
the...
the
degree
of
proof
that's
required
by
this
court
precedents.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
view
those
as
the
same
thing.
we
may
be
just
having--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--in
that
sense,
absolutely.
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
i
understood
the
terminology.
that's
correct.
but
let
me
make
quite
clear
that
we
are
discussing
in
the
first
half
hour
and
the
second
half
hour
i
think
two
slightly
different
things.
the
first
half
hour
focused
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
arrest
vel
non,
which
is
at
issue
in
atwater,
for
example,
and
at
issue...
not
even
in
whren,
which
is
just
a
traffic
stop.
i
am
focusing
on
the
somewhat
different
point.
there
is
a
line
of
cases
that
deals
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
and
it
says
because
at
common
law
you
could
not
search
someone
pursuant
to
an
arrest
that
was
a
trespass,
the
search
itself
is
unconstitutional.
so
if
at
the
time
of
the
framing
a
federal
officer,
a
federal
marshal,
at
the
time
of
the
framing
had
the
power
to
arrest
them
for
state
law
offenses,
as
they
still
do
under
the
olc
opinions.
if
a
federal
marshal
had
gone
up
to
someone
who's
committing
a
completely
trivial
offense,
atwater
recognizes
there
are
offenses
at
common
law
that
are
not
arrestable.
that
would
be
a
trespass
and
to
search
the
person
incident
to
that
arrest
would
have
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
we
believe.
it
would
have
been
unreasonable.
when
mapp
applies
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
states,
it
would
have
been--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
at
common
law
and
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that's
right.
you
look
to
the
positive
source
of
authority,
which
is
state
law
authority
to
arrest
or
a
common
law
authority
to
arrest.
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
that...
that
rule
also
make
sense
as
a
question
of
the
structure
of
our
democracy.
remember,
it
puts
in
the
hands
of
the
legislature,
which
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
decision
to
make
a
trivial
offense--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
there
are
times--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
right.
that
is...
there
are
traditions
that
are
rooted
in
the
common
law,
that
the
search
incident
to
arrest
here
was
pursuant
to
a
trespass
at
common
law
that
was
completely
unreasonable.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
this
is
i
think
the
hardest
question
for
us,
and
so
if
i
could
have
the
time
to
give
you
a
couple
of
answers.
the
first
is
remember
your
instrumental
point
is
that
the
officer
has
the
person,
they
need
to
protect
themselves.
we
know
that
is
not
itself...
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
couple
of
answers...
that
is
not
itself
to
make
the
search
constitutional
because
everyone
agrees
that
if
the
arrest
was
unconstitutional,
then
the
search,
notwithstanding
the
exigencies
that
exist
under
chimel
and
like
cases
all
the
way
back,
exist.
so
it's
not
enough
that
the
officer
has
to
protect
himself.
the
reason--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
i
understand
this.
justice
souter,
i
understand.
i
was
just
trying
to
get
to
your...
what
i
think
is
the
greatest
sort
of
logical
force:
the
officer
need
to
protect
himself.
now,
to
get
to
the
harder
case,
which
is
yours,
and
that
is
accept
that
the
arrest
is
constitutional.
we
of
course
don't
do
that.
we
believe
that
there
isn't
a
sufficient
interest
to
make
it
reasonable,
but
you
posit
otherwise.
the
reason
is
given
by
justice
powell's
concurrence
in
robinson,
which
is
the
fundamental
search
and
seizure
arrest
case,
and
he
says
when
the
person
is
lawfully
arrested
they
have
engaged
in
conduct
that
they
know
can
subject
them
to
arrest,
they
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
so
while
it's
the
case
that
the
governmental
interest
remains
the
same...
protect
the
officer,
find
the
evidence...
the
other
side
of
the
fourth
amendment
balance
is
fundamentally
different,
because
when
a
person
has
engaged
in
conduct
which
they
know
does
not
subject
them
to
arrest
they
do
not
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
this
individual
had
every
reason
to
believe
dating
back
to
the
traditions
of
common
law,
to
positive
state
law,
that
they
would
not
be
searched
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
can
i
just
correct
one
thing?
and
that
is
it
does
not
depend
on
justice
powell's
use
of
the
word
unlawful.
i
believe
to
rule
against
us,
justice
souter,
that
you
will
have
to
overrule
the
line
of
cases
from
di
re
to
defillipo.
those
are
on
point.
now
you
may
decide--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
kennedy,
and
that's
why
i
focused
so
much
on
searches
incident
to
arrest.
there
are
times
when
state
law
is
incorporated
into
the
fourth
amendment,
and
everybody
agrees
that
regulatory
searches
are;
inventory
searches
are,
there
are
times
when
it
isn't.
and
california
v
greenwood
is
not
one
and
there's
a
logical
reason
for
it.
and
that
is
that
the
premise
of
when
you
were
deciding
in
a...
in
a
trash
search,
this
court's
document
looked
at
two
things.
the
first
is,
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
if
there
is
do
we
balance
the
interest?
california
v
greenwood
says
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
that's
evaluated
as
a
societal
matter.
i'm
focusing
on
a
very
narrow
question
that
doesn't
disturb
any
other
doctrines.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think
cooper
v
california
is
a
very
good
case
for
us,
because
cooper
and
all
its
progeny
say
that
state
law
has
to
authorize
and
determine
the
validity
of
the
inventory
search.
if
you
violate
the
state
regulations
on
when
you
conduct
an
inventory
search,
you
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
think
it
is
a
terribly
difficult
rule
to
administer
when
you
try
to
decide,
well
if
this
is
a
law
that
sometimes
allows
arrest
and
sometimes
does
not.
it
is
an
infinitely
more
administrable
rule
on
our
side,
where
we
say
to
the
police
officers,
you
have
the
power
to
arrest
or
not
and
that's
what
determines--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice
kennedy,
remember,
we
have
one
standard
for
an
officer
on
the
street,
and
that
is,
look...
do,
if
you're
allowed
to
arrest,
you
can
arrest,
and
that's
what
will
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest.
the
government
posits
two
different
standards
that
govern
the
officer's
conduct:
a
federal
one
and
state
one.
but
let
me
also
get
to
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
that
you
are
worried
that
are
all
kinds
of
these
state
laws.
there's...
you
know,
are
you
out
of
your
jurisdiction,
are
you
wearing
a
uniform?
what
we
think
that
the
common
law
was
concerned
with,
and
this
line...
this
court's
court
line
of
cases
from
di
re
to
defillipo
is
a
more
fundamental
judgment.
it's
like
the
judgment
whether
it's
a
crime
at
all.
the
police
power
of
the
state
is
most
fundamentally,
is
this
a
crime,
can
we
arrest
for
it,
someone
for
it,
so
that
we
will
hold
them?
and
those
are
the
judgments:
is
its
arrestable
or
not?
and
not
these
other
little
things
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--this
is
a
very...
just
as
a
court
note,
there's
no
other
state
that
has
one
of
these
statutes.
just
in
terms
of
your
thinking
about
whether
this
is
a
common
practice,
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
any
others,
and
even
in
virginia,
it's
only
to
a
small
body
of
offenses.
but
even
taking
as
a
given...
justice
stevens,
i
think
doctrinally,
as
justice
powell
says
in
robinson,
the
notion
is
that
people
go
out
into
the
world
and
engage
in
conduct,
and
we
expect
them
to
know
the
law.
sometimes
that's
an
unreasonable
expectation,
but
it's
the
only
premise
that
this
court--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--chief
justice
roberts,
i
do
disagree.
post-cooper,
in
south
dakota
v.
opperman,
even
if
the
police
officers
label
it
an
inventory
search...
the
person
says,
oh,
we
were
just
trying
to
keep
track
of
everything,
so
nobody
doubts
they
were
really
inventorying
things...
the
court
has
said
it's
the...
the
practice
is,
the
state
practice
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
disagree.
this
court
has
said
many
times,
and
indeed
squarely
held
in
johnson,
where
the
evidence
was
suppressed,
that
it
has
to
be
an
arrest
that
is
lawful
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
not...
i
don't
think
that
language
is
relevant
for
the
following
reason:
what
the
court
said
in
cooper
was
that
the
seizure
of
the
car,
which
is
analogous
to
the
arrest
here,
right?
they
seized
my
client's
person;
they
seized
the
car.
the
court
said
because
the
seizure
of
the
car
was
lawful
under
state
law,
then
the
search
incident
to
was.
and
let
me
just
read
to
you
from
coolidge
versus--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
state
law
did
not
speak
to
it
either
way,
but...
it
didn't
speak
to
it
either
way.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
i
disagree.
in
any
event,
post-cooper,
south
dakota
v.
opperman,
as
the
conversation
between
the
chief
justice
and
i
was
just
explaining,
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
inventory
search
has
to
be
authorized
pursuant
to
state
regulation.
if
after
cooper
this
is
perfectly
settled,
there
really
isn't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--assuming
the
court
decides
that
the
question
was
not
waived
because
it
wasn't
briefed,
the
reason
is
that
this
court's
exclusionary
rule
precedents
look
to
something
else,
and
that
is:
did
the
evidence
follow
directly
from
the
unconstitutional
conduct?
and
here
it
did.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
illustrates
the
point
i
am
willing
to
accept,
and
that
is
there
are
times
that
state
law
is
relevant
under
this
court's
doctrines;
there
are
times
it
isn't.
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
for
example,
is
another
example
where
the
court
looks
squarely
to
the
state
law
of
whether
and
how
serious
the
offense
is.
my
point
is
that
there
is
a
very
particular
doctrine
that
is
in
play
here
that
deals
with
searches
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
don't
know.
that
is
the
true
answer,
because
no
state
has
such
a
law.
it
would
depend,
i
think,
on
whether
the
arrest
itself
satisfied
constitutional--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
reason
is
i
think
the
one...
that
the
court
has
never
looked
to
the
state
law
remedies
in
di
re,
miller,
johnson,
ker,
and
defillippo,
and
that
it
looks
to
what
the
common
law
would
look
to,
which
is:
is
the
arrest
legal
or
not?
i
also
would
repeat
what
i
said
to
justice
breyer,
and
that
is
i
would
not
assume
that
virginia
believes
that
the
exclusionary
rule
wouldn't
apply
because
those
precedents
trigger
the
fourth
amendment.
but,
justice
breyer,
i
do
want
to
come
back
to
your
question
about,
okay,
whren.
the
important
differences
are:
remember
whren
didn't
just
say
that
things
about
whether
people
can
be
arrested
are
trivialities.
it's
at
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
would
never
say
that
arrest
is
a
triviality.
what
it's
talking
about
is
what
concerned
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
rule
in
whren,
which
is
the
guy
had
to
be
in
a
police
uniform
and
driving
around
in
a
marked
police
cruiser,
which
could
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction,
the
court
felt
that
was
more
of
a
triviality.
this
is
a
much
more
fundamental
statement--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
have
proposed
two
alternative
rules.
fundamentally,
that's
right.
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i'm
sorry.
you're
right:
on
our
core
condition,
the
evidence
would
not
be
suppressed.
the
reason
is
that
we
think
the
most
fundamental
state
judgment
here
is
whether
this
offense
is
arrestable.
alternatively,
the
court
could
apply
a
rule
that
just
says
state
officers,
if
they're
allowed
to
arrest
lawfully,
then
that
will
generate
a
constitutional
search
incident
to
arrest.
we
would
win
under
either
either
rule.
i
think
the
core
of
our
case
is
a
much
simpler
rule
that
simply
says
if
the
state
has
decided
this
thing
is
not
arrestable,
it
obviously
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
the
arrest
that
would
outweigh
the
individual's
expectation
of
privacy...
remember
search
incident
to
arrest
is
an
exigency.
there
is
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--to...
that's
correct.
if
we
are
going
to
follow
the
common
law
and
the
rule
that
is
articulated,
i
think,
in
every
single
search-incident-to-arrest
case,
that
it
has
to
be
a
lawful
arrest,
that's
right.
it
will
take
up
all
of
state
arrest
law.
i'm
not
trying
to
hide
from
that
fact.
but
the
court
has
never
had
a
problem
with
that.
in
all
of
those
cases
all
through
time,
it
has
never
had
any
problem
with
administerability
or
anything
else
with
a
rule
that
simply
says
to
the
police
officer:
if
you're
allowed
to
arrest
him,
arrest
him;
if
you're
not,
you're
not,
and
you
can't
search
him
constitutionally.
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
do
when
it
comes
to
the
search-incident-to-arrest
cases.
i
think
two
things.
this
is
my
understanding
of
the
court's
precedents.
the
court
has
said
if
you
have
probable
cause,
you
can
arrest.
in
every
case
that
it
has
said
that,
it
has
been
lawful
at
state
law
to
arrest...
to
arrest.
so
the
court
has
confronted
this
question
when
it
comes
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
arrest
vel
non.
there
is
a
second
line
of
cases
that
deals
specifically
with
this
search-incident-to-arrest
doctrine,
and
in
every
one
of
those,
it
has
both
said
it
has
to
be
a
lawful
arrest.
and
then
in
five
separate
cases,
it
has
explained
what
it
meant
by
a
"lawful
arrest".
and
it
can't
be
dictum.
the
evidence
in
johnson
versus
the
united
states
was
suppressed.
it
has
to
have
been
the
holding
of
the
court.
we
think
that
that
is
a
sensible
rule
for
two
reasons:
it
is
what
framers
meant.
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
a
federal
marshal,
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
could
go
and
just
arrest
somebody
for
a
completely
trivial
offense...
that
was
a
trespass...
and
then
search
them.
and,
second,
justice
powell's
concurrence
in
robinson
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
but
if
you
engage
in
constitutional--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
not
what
the
court
said.
the
court
was
quite
clear
on
this,
justice
alito.
i
just
don't
think
there's
two
ways
about
it.
it
was
quite
on
all
five
of
these
cases.
i'm
not
saying
the
court
couldn't
have
decided
the
case
otherwise.
that's
true.
i
think
the
court
could
have
had
a
different
rationale,
but
the
point
is
it
didn't.
all
of
these
cases
cite
each
other.
it's
a
uniform
line
of
authority.
it's
not
an
accident.
it's
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
then...
i
don't
know
how
you
pronounce
it
either,
but
i
do
know
that
johnson,
ker,
and
defillippo
are
cases
that
are
against
the
state.
they
are
not
supervisory
authority
cases.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
disagree.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
may
i?
there
is
no
claim
of
good
faith
here
which
could
be
raised
to
a
fourth
amendment
argument
in
a
later
case.
there's
absolutely
no
mistake.
and
we
don't
want
to
encourage
officers
to
conduct
illegal
arrests
and
search
people.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
it.
