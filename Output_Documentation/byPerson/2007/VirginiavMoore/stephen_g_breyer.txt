justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you...
excuse
me,
sorry,
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
particular
illegal
arrest
here,
to
bring
this
down
to
earth
a
little
bit,
is
i
take
it
they
arrested
him
because
he
had
a
suspended...
he
was
driving
without
a
good
license?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
that
virginia
law
says
if
you
stop
somebody,
arrest
him...
if
you
stop
somebody,
you
know
he
doesn't
have
a
license
to
drive,
you
can
arrest
him
if
you
think
he's
going
to
continue
driving?
can't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
policemen
here,
according
to
you
and
i
guess
the
virginia
court,
made
a
misjudgment.
he
thought
this
guy
might
still
drive
somewhere
or
he
might
have
thought
it
or
a
policeman
in
similar
circumstances
might
have
thought
it.
so
virginia
says
if,
in
fact,
policemen,
you
stop
somebody
for
suspended...
for
driving
without
a
license,
and
you
make
a
mistake,
you
arrest
him,
we
don't
think
that's
a
big
deal,
because
who
knows
if
he's
going
to
continue
to
drive.
we
don't
even
suspend.
we
don't
even
suppress
the
evidence.
that's
virginia.
so
if
virginia
isn't
going
to
suppress
the
evidence
because
they
think
it's
not
a
big
deal
to
make,
for
the
policeman
to
make
a
mistake
as
to
whether
a
person
who's
driving
without
a
license
will
keep
driving
once
the
policeman
goes
away,
why
do
you
think
thomas
jefferson
and
everybody
else
thought
that
that
was
such
a
big
deal
that
the
evidence
had
to
be
suppressed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
difference
between
this
and
whren?
that
is,
in
whren
the
arrest
violated
a
d.c.
regulation
that
says
a
plainclothes
officer
cannot
approach
a
car
except
in
immediate
cases
of
immediate
danger.
and
in
whren
we
said
that
isn't
such
a
big
deal
and
we
don't
think
the
fourth
amendment
turns
on
that
kind
of
triviality.
all
right.
if
it
doesn't
turn
on
that
kind
of
arrest
procedure
triviality,
is
how
we
characterized
it
there,
how
is
this
any
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
we
go
back
for
a
second?
because,
the
reason
i
asked
my
question
is
i
was
thinking
about
this
very
differently,
and
i
just
want
to
have
an
answer,
and
i
want
your
best
thinking
on
this.
my
thought
is
that
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
when
a
state...
when
a
person
is
arrested
in
violation
of
state
law,
the
answer
is:
it
depends.
sometimes
yes,
sometimes
no.
obviously,
if
there
is
no
probable
cause
or
if
there
wasn't
a
crime
at
all,
as
just
defined,
the
answer
is
yes;
but
then
i
look
at
whren
and
it
says
if
all
that
was
at
stake
was
a
kind
of
arrest
procedure
state
law,
herein...
there
embodied
in
a
rule,
the
answer
is
no.
so
i
look
at
this
one.
and
this
one
it
seems
to
me
there
is
probable
cause;
it
is
a
crime;
moreover,
it
is
a
crime
for
which
the
state
permits
arrest
where
the
officer
subjectively
thinks
he's
likely
to
keep
driving.
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
maybe
much
more
close
to
what
we
had
in
whren.
now
i
want
you
to
say...
i
want
your
comments
on
what
i...
it's
hypothetical,
my
statement,
because
i
want
to
get
your
reaction
to
that
point
of
view.
i'm
not
saying
i
hold
it.
but
i'm
putting
it
forward
so
that
i
can
get
your
reaction
and
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
putting
cases
aside
for
the
moment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean
if
we
reach
this
question,
you
must
have
lost
on
the
first
question.
i
mean
you
win...
if
you
win
on
the
first
question,
you
win.
if
you...
all
right.
if
you
have
lost
on
the
first
question,
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
search...
arrest,
rather,
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and,
moreover,
it's
not
enough
of
a
big
deal,
so
the
state
makes
it
suppressible.
otherwise,
a...
and
so
now
we're
talking
about
minor
things
under
state
law
that
is
secondary
at
the
least.
and
there,
when
the
policeman
make
a
mistake
about
that,
the
reason
we
let
him
search
is
he
might
be
hurt,
the
policeman.
there's
danger
involved.
and
so
i
don't
see
why
at
the
moment
that
rationale
wouldn't
apply
just
as
strongly
with
a
reason
for
it
being
unlawful
under
state
but
not
federal
law
is
a
violation
of
one
of
these
subsidiary
rules
whether
he,
you
know,
thought
the
guy
was
going
to
keep
driving
under
the
suspended
license
or,
you
know,
might
be
risky
or
might
not
show
up.
