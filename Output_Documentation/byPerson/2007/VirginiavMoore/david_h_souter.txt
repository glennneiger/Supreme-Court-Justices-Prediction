no,
but
you're
also
arguing,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the...
that
the
search,
even
in
the
case
of
the
tax
arrest,
does
fall
within
the
rationale
of
search
incident
to
an
arrest
because
one
of
those
two
rationales
is
officer
safety.
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
you
reject
the
premise
of
the
question
then?
the
premise
of
the
question
was
that
the
search
incident
to
the
arrest
in
the
tax
case
is
outside
the
rationale
of
searches
incident
to
an
arrest;
and
your
position
is
it's
not
outside
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
isn't
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
that
we...
we
have
rejected
the,
in
effect,
the
trespass
rationale;
and
what
you're
telling
us
now,
it
seems
to
me,
based
on
in
effect
trespass
concepts,
is
that
so
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
an
arrest
may
constitutionally
be
made,
but
the
officer
following
that
arrest
may
not
take
the
step
of
determining
whether
the
individual
arrested
has
on
his
person
anything
that
can
be
used
to
hurt
the
officer
like
a
knife
or
a
gun?
and
why
should
be
we
draw
what
seems
to
me...
if
we
scrap,
as
we
have
done,
the
trespass
analogy,
why
should
we
make
what
seems
to
me
at
least
an
irrational
distinction
of
saying
the
fourth
amendment
says
it's
okay
to
arrest
but
it's
not
okay
to
protect
yourself
after
you
have
arrested?
why
should
we
accept
such
a
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
but
we're
starting
with
a
different
premise.
justice
david
h.
souter
we're
starting
with
a
constitutional
premise.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that...
if
that
logic
is
sound
and
that
logic
depends
on
justice
powell's
use
of
the
word
unlawfully,
then
it
seems
to
me
the...
the
only
way
to
arrest
an
irrational
system
would
to
be
conclude
that,
in
fact,
the
arrest
is
not
constitutionally
lawful.
because
on...
on
your
logic,
you're
still
left
with
the
problem
that
i
raised;
and
a
constitutional
arrest
in
which
the
officer
does
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
apprehending
the
person,
and
yet
the
officer
is
disabled
from
protecting
himself,
if
we're
going
to
have
a
sensible
rule,
we've
either
got
to
say
the
fourth
amendment
allows
him
to
make
the
search
incident
and
protect
himself,
or
we've
got
to
have
a
rule
that
says
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
allow
him
to
make
the
search...
make
the
arrest
in
the
first
place.
otherwise
we've
got
a
crazy
system.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
would
never
know
about
it
if
the...
if
the
misdemeanor,
or
jaywalking
offense,
was
not
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
a
problem
for
you
here,
but
that
is
a
limitation
on
what
we
have
held.
