bader

if
this
officer
had
complied
with
the
state
law,
that
is
he
had
issued
a
summons,
then
you
agree
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply
if
he
went
ahead
and
searched.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
you
explain
the
logic
to
saying
that
when
the
police
violate
state
law,
then
the
evidence
can
come
in;
but
when
they
comply
with
state
law,
it
can't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
agree
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest,
given
the
state
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
committed
an
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
there
probable
cause
to
arrest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
he...
could
this
officer
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
arrest
moore?
could
he...
is
it...
oh,
there's
an
offense
going
on
under
virginia
law,
i'm
going
to
check
with...
call
in
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
warrant.
could
he
have
gotten
a
warrant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
could
he...
how
could
he
have
gotten
a
warrant
to
arrest
when
it's
a
nonarrestable
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
couldn't...
would
a
judge
have
told
this
police
officer...
they
have
a
call-in
procedure,
call
the
judge.
you
want
to...
you
need
to
issue
a
warrant
to
arrest
him
for
driving
with
a
suspended
license,
but
that's
not
an
arrestable
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
these
officers
think
this...
those
circumstances
exist?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you're
right,
mr.
dreeben,
then
the
court
gave
a
false
signal
when
it
gvr'd
in
lovelace,
in
the
lovelace
case,
the
person
who
was
drinking
in
public,
it
gvr'd
in
light
of
knowles.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
could
not
have
been
a
warrant...
a
grant...
a
judge
could
not
have
given
a
warrant
for
arrest
on
these
charges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
often
and
under
what
circumstances
is
that
virginia...
virginia
law
rule?
i
mean,
when
does
a
general
district
court
give
permission
for
a
custodial
arrest
in
a
certain
class
of
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
crime
at
all?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
crime
at
all;
jaywalking,
for
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mccullough,
there
is
one
thing
that
i
was
curious
about.
it
is
this
virginia
law
that
allows
the
custodial
arrest
pursuant
to
an
order
of
a
general
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
is
that
used?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
be
the
basis
of
a...
can
a
district
court
enter
such
an
order
just
because
it
thinks
it's
a
good
idea?
are
there
any
grounds
in--
