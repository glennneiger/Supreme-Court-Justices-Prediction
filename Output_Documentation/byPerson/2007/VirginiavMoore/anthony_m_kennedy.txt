if
we
rule
for
respondent
in
this
case,
would
we
have
to
reexamine
the
holding
in
california
v.
greenwood?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
should
know
this,
but
do
we
defer
to
state
law
in
determining
the
lawfulness
of
the
time
before
arraignment
in
the
context
of
confessions,
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
federal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was
there
any
indication
in
that
case
that
if
the
state
had
a
shorter
period,
they
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
you
think
we
have
to,
if
not
overrule,
at
least
back
away
from
the
holding
in
california
versus
greenwood?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
is
much
easier
to
administer,
to
have
a
uniform
federal
standard,
rather
than
whether
or
not
an
officer
can
arrest
in
one
county
for
something
and
not
in
another
county
whether
he
has
to
have
a
badge
or
not.
those
are
the
kind
of
trivialities
we
talked
about
in
whren.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
both
arrests
are
illegal,
but
you're
saying
that
there's
a
difference.
so
your
bright-line
rule
now
seems
to
evaporate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
i'm
assuming
that
your
answer
to
my
question
about
the
badge
or
the
wrong
county
and
so
forth
would
not
result
in
suppression.
correct
me
if
i
have
misinterpreted
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
if
you...
do
you
accept
the
proposition
then,
in
some
of
these
minor
cases,
the
arrest
might
be
valid,
then
you're
whole
argument
about
the
framers
and
the
trespass
and
so
forth
is
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court
simply
said
we're
going
to
use
our
federal
supervisory
power
and
incorporate
the
state
law
of
arrest.
if
we
don't
have
another
body
of
law,
we're
going
to
do
it.
it
didn't
say
it
was
required
to
by
the
constitution.
that's
not
the
way
i
read
di
re.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
you
have
three
cases,
not
five.
