mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
states
and
the
federal
government
may
for
a
variety
of
reasons
enact
restrictions
on
officer
authority
that
exceed
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
this
court
has
articulated
them.
when
such
state
law
or
federal
law
extra-constitutional
restrictions
are
violated,
it
is
a
matter
for
the
government
that
enacted
them
to
determine
what
remedy
appropriately
flows
from
that
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
court
has
never--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
certainly,
justice
scalia,
such
an
individual
wouldn't
have
positive
law
authority
to
engage
in
an
arrest.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
question
would
then
be
whether
that
means
that
it's
automatically
a
constitutional
violation.
i
think
in
some
situations
even
a
governmental
official
can
act
in
a
private
capacity
by
acting
outside
the
boundaries
of
that
individual's
responsibility.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
if
you
assume
that
the
court
would
have
two
options.
it
could
either
federalize
some
sort
of
an
amorphous
requirement
that
there
must
be
law
enforcement
authority
in
an
official
in
order
for
that
official
to
engage
in
fourth
amendment
activity,
or
it
could
hold
that,
what
i
think
is
the
more
reasonable
approach,
which
is
that
the
bedrock
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
protect
against
arbitrariness,
and
the
crucial
one
here
is
the
existence
of
probable
cause
based
on
the
facts
to
believe
that
the
individual
has
violated
a
law.
if
that
criteria
is
met,
it
is
not
constitutionally
unreasonable,
absent
where
an
extraordinary
intrusion
for
the
individual's
liberty
or
privacy
interests
to
be
compromised.
it
may
be
the
most
flagrant
violation
of
departmental
regulations
in
the
world,
and
in
that
case
the
department
that
has
those
regulations
can
take
action,
just
as
here
virginia
says
if
you
violate
the
arrestable
offense
rule
under
virginia
law,
the
consequence
is
not
to
exclude
evidence.
virginia
will
not
exclude
evidence
under
its
own
state
law
for
a
violation
of
this
provision.
but
it
does
say
under
state
law
that
a
person
can
resist
an
unlawful
arrest,
the
officer
can
be
sued
for
engaging
in
an
unlawful
arrest
under
state
law,
and
that
the
officer
can
be
fired
or
disciplined.
and
those
are
the
sanctions
that
the
state
has
chosen
to
do.
now,
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
done
is
come
along
and
say,
even
though
you
do
not
intend
this
rule
to
trigger
the
exclusionary
rule
under
virginia
law,
you
have
no
choice.
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
if
virginia
decides
to
exceed
the
constitutional
minimum
as
this
court
announced
in
atwater
and
place
additional
restrictions
on
the
arrest
authority,
it
must
pay
a
constitutional
price
of
having
the
evidence
excluded
if
that
rule
is
violated.
at
the
outset,
it's
clear
that
imposing
such
a
fourth
amendment
rule
would
do
nothing
other
than
discourage
the
states
from
providing
additional
restrictions
as
a
matter
of
their
own
state's
law
that
may
serve
to
protect
citizen
privacy
interests
above
the
floor
that
this
court
has
identified
as
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
know
that
it
gave
a
false
signal,
justice
ginsburg,
but
a
gvr
doesn't
indicate
this
court's
disposition
of
the
merits
once
all
of
the
arguments
are
presented
to
it.
and,
admittedly,
i
think
neither
side
is
able
to
point
to
a
case
that
squarely
addressed
and
conclusively
resolved
the
issue
that's
before
this
court.
what
the
court
has
done,
i
think,
under
related
issues
under
fourth
amendment
law
is
announce
pretty
clearly
that
the
fact
that
a
state
has
either
renounced
an
interest
in
taking
a
particular
law
enforcement
action
that
it
could
otherwise
constitutionally
take
or
positively
prohibited
a
law
enforcement
action
does
not
mean
that
the
action
is
unconstitutional.
as
long
ago
as
the
cooper
v.
california
case,
the
court
dealt
with
the
situation
where
an
officer
was
not
authorized
to
undertake
an
inventory
search,
and
the
california
courts
treat
it
as
a
violation
of
their
own
law.
this
court
said
it
was
still
a
reasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment;
and
unless
respondent...
excuse
me,
unless...
well,
respondent
concludes
that
there
should
be
a
different
fourth
amendment
rule
for
searches
than
procedures,
cooper
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
violation
of
state
law
does
not
ipso
facto
equate
to
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
kennedy.
california
v.
greenwood
is
the
next
case
in
the
line
where
the
court
recognized
that
california
had
made
it
illegal
to
conduct
garbage
searches.
and
you
could
make
the
same
argument
that
respondent
is
making
here
today:
that
california
had
renounced
any
interest
in
conducting
garbage
searches,
therefore
there's
nothing
on
the
state
side
of
the
line
to
balance
against
the
individual's
invasion
of
privacy,
and
therefore
the
state
should
lose.
and
this
court
held
precisely
the
opposite
in
california
v.
greenwood,
finding
that
it
was
constitutionally
reasonable
to
engage
in
the
garbage
search
because
there
was
no
federally
recognized
expectation
of
privacy,
even
though
the
state
had
decided
to
go
further
and
grant
an
additional
layer
of
protection
to
its
citizens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
venturing
a
little
bit
outside
of
my
expertise
under
state
law,
but
i
think
that
that's
correct.
because
state
law
provided
that
this
was
not
an
arrestable
offense
unless
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
offense
existed.
and
i
should
note
that
one
of
the
offenses
here...
excuse
me...
one
of
the
exceptions
here
is
that
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
could
have
entered
an
exemption
from
the
arrestable
offense
rule
and
then
officers
within
that
jurisdiction
would
have
been
constitutionally
and
under
state
law--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
know
that
it
has
done
it.
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
restrictions
on
when
it
would
do
it.
the
point,
i
think,
of
giving
the
general
courts
the
authority
to
do
this
is
that
these
kinds
of
laws
are
not
necessarily
enacted,
as
respondent
posits,
to
be
supplementary
protection
for
privacy.
they
do
not
necessarily
represent
a
judgment
that
law
enforcement
officers
should
never
bring
people
in
for
minor
traffic
misdemeanors.
they
may
represent
a
judgment
that
law
enforcement
officers
should
be
out
on
the
beat
policing
more
important
crimes
and
it's
a
waste
of
social
resources
and
scarce
police
resources
to
have
them
bringing
people
downtown
for
these
kinds
of
offenses.
in
a
particular
jurisdiction,
law
enforcement
may
make
a
case
that
actually
it's
important
enough
to
deter
various
traffic
violations
and
to
ensure
that
the
individuals
show
up,
that
officers
should
have
plenary
authority
to
make
arrests.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--is
uniquely
federal.
the
closest
analog...
and
this
may
be
what
your
honor
has
in
mind...
is
that
in
the
county
of
riverside
case
the
court
set
a
48-hour
outside
limit
for
when
you
have
to
bring
an
arrested
individual
before
a
magistrate
for
a
probable
cause
hearing.
under
respondent's
position--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
and
that's
precisely,
i
think,
the
point.
all
of
the
rules
that
this
court
has
announced
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
search
incident
to
arrest
rule,
which
is
triggered
as
a
bright-line
rule
without
regard
to
whether
the
specifics
of
the
case
support
it,
under
respondent's
theory
virginia
could
overrule
that
by
saying
officers
shall
not
conduct
a
search
incident
to
arrest
without
a
specific
exigency
in
that
case.
states
could
overrule
within
their
own
jurisdictions
the
federal
rule
that
this
court
announced
in
riverside.
it
could
say
that
individuals
have
to
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
within
12
hours
or
they
have
to
be
released.
and
under
respondent's
theory
that
you
absorb
state
law
into
the
reasonableness
inquiry,
this
court's
federal
court
decision
would
be
overruled.
and
most
directly
here,
atwater
would
be
overruled
with
respect
to
non-arrestable
offenses
if
respondent's
position
is
correct
that
when
the
state
has
said
that
we
don't
want
to
undertake
an
arrest
for
a
minor
offense,
therefore,
there's
no
longer
any
state
interest
in
undertaking
the
arrest.
the
reality
is
that
this
court
has
balanced
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law
what
is
constitutionally
necessary
as
a
uniform
federal
matter
to
protect
people
against
arbitrary
law
enforcement
action,
and
it's
drawn
the
line
at
probable
cause.
and
as
this
court
said
in
whren,
absent
rare
circumstances
when
probable
cause
exists,
a
search
or
seizure
is
reasonable.
and
the
kind
of
rare
circumstances
that
the
court
gave
the
example
of
in
whren
were
heightened
intrusions
on
individual
privacy
or
liberties
such
as
surgery
to
remove
evidence
or
an
unannounced
entry
into
a
home.
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
here
and
the
standard
federal
rule
should
govern.
