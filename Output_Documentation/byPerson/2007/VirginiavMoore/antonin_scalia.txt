justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccullough,
the
proposition
that
you're
arguing,
does
it
apply
at
the
federal
level
as
well?
suppose...
suppose
i
think
that
my
neighbor
next
door
is
growing
marijuana
and
i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
all
right?
so
i
go
in
and
search
his
house;
and
sure
enough,
there
is
marijuana.
and
i
bring
it
to
the
police's
attention,
and
they
eventually
arrest
him.
is
that
lawful
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
a
state
actor,
i
guess.
you
know...--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
a
supreme
court
justice
should
not
be...--
[laughter]
--should
not
be
living
next
door
to
somebody
growing
marijuana.
it
doesn't
seem
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
dance
around.
is
it...
is
it
rendered
an
unreasonable
search
by
the
fact
that
i'm
not
a
law
enforcement
officer
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
any
federal
employee
can
go
crashing
around
conducting
searches
and
seizures?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
he
has
probable
cause?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fantastic.
[laughter]
do
you
really
think
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
that
you
are
an
administrative
law
judge
at
the,
you
know,
bureau
of
customs?
it
doesn't
matter?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
janitor?
you're
a
janitor,
a
federally
employed
janitor.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
neighbor
is
growing
marijuana,
and
he's
just
as
offended
as
a
supreme
court
justice
would
be.
can
he
conduct
a
search?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
could
say
that
in
this,
in
these
unique
circumstances,
where
the
officers
could
not
let
the
fellow
drive
off
without
a
license,
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
arrest
him,
but
in
some
other
situation
where
they
had
no
arrest
authority
it
would
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
let's
assume
that
the
stop
was
not
based
on
some,
some
deficiency
in
his
license
or
some
deficiency
in
the
car...
i
don't
know
what
else
it
could
be...
like,
he
had
been
going
too
fast,
okay?
and
it's
just
a
misdemeanor.
he
was
five
miles
over
the
speed
limit.
now,
in
that
situation
you
couldn't
say,
as
you've
said
here,
gee,
if
they
just
let
him
go,
he'd
still
be
driving
without
a
license;
they
had
to
arrest
him;
they
had
no
choice.
in
that
situation,
he
wouldn't
necessarily
be
going
above
the
speed
limit.
would
that
be...
why
couldn't
you
say
it
was
reasonable
here,
but
it
wouldn't
be
reasonable
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
argument
you're
making,
then
don't
bring
forward
the
argument
that
they
couldn't
let
him
go
because
he'd
be
in
violation
of
the
law.
if
you
want
us
to
make
that
narrow
a
holding,
i
guess
we
can.
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you're
asking
us
to
balance.
you're
asking
us
to
say,
after
all,
in
this
case
if
they
hadn't
arrested
he
would
have
been
violating
the
law
as
soon
as
they
let
him
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
this
was
not
unlawful
under
virginia
law,
then,
because
of
the
factor
you
brought
forth?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
a
discretionary
call.
it
wasn't
a
discretionary
call.
he
couldn't
arrest
the
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
person
making
the
arrest
at
least
have
to
have
some
arrest
authority?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
will
a
janitor
do
the
job?
a
janitor
at
the
justice
department
becomes
imbued
with
the
mission
of
the
department
and
he
goes
around
arresting
people
or
searching
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
this
person
here
didn't
have
positive
law
authority
to
engage
in
an
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
he
was
purporting
to
act
in
an
official
capacity.
and
he
did,
indeed,
give
the
marijuana
to
the
officials
at
the
justice
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
think
they
would
accept
arresting
somebody
for
not
wearing
a
seat
belt?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
we've
crossed
that
bridge
with
atwater.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's
designed
to
test
whether
you
really
mean
unlawful
under
state
law.
either
you
don't
mean
it,
because
something
that
violates
a
municipal
ordnance
is
unlawful
under
state
law,
and
yet
you
would
not
apply
your
test.
so
you
could
express
your
test
differently,
unlawful
under
state
statutory
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
cooper...
cooper
v
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
goldstein,
can
i
bring
you
back
to
cooper
v.
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
you
say
is
a
good
case
for
you.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that.
this
was
a
case
of
a
car
impounded.
the
state
court
had
said
that
there
was
no
authority
to
search
the
car,
simply
because
it
was
impounded,
and
we
said
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
search
was
authorized
by
state
law;
the
question
is
rather
whether
the
search
was
a
reasonable
one
under
the
fourth
amendment.
just
as
a
search
authorized
by
state
law
may
be
an
unreasonable
one
under
that
amendment,
so
may
a
search
not
expressly
authorized
by
state
law
be
justified
as
a
constitutional
reasonable
one.
and
you
think
that
helps
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
the
state
law
did
not
authorize
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
assume
ing,
in
that
passage,
that
the
state
law
did
not
authorize
it,
or
otherwise
the
passage
makes
no
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccullough,
what
is
here,
for
some
reason
the
commonwealth
did
not
cite
cooper
v.
california,
which
i
can't
understand
unless
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
it
has
been
overruled
by
later
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
why
didn't
you
cite
cooper
v.
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
in
february
of
2003,
two
police
officers
from
the
city
of
portsmouth,
virginia
stopped
a
car
driven
by
david
lee
moore.
they
determined
that
moore
was
driving
on
a
suspended
license
in
violation
of
virginia
law
and
placed
him
under
arrest.
upon
searching
moore,
they
discovered
that
he
was
carrying
16
grams
of
crack
cocaine.
as
it
turned
out,
the
arrest
was
not
authorized
under
virginia
law,
which
permits
the
arrest
for
driving
under
a
suspended
license
only
in
circumstances
that
were
not
present
in
this
case.
moore
was
charged
with
possession
of
cocaine
with
intent
to
distribute.
he
argued
in
the
trial
court
that
prosecutors
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
the
evidence
from
the
officers'
search,
the
16
grams
of
crack
cocaine,
because
the
arrest
violated
state
law.
now,
virginia
law
does
not
ordinarily
require
the
exclusion
of
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
state
law,
but
moore
contended
that
an
arrest
in
violation
of
state
law
violated
the
federal
constitution's
prohibition
on
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
in
the
fourth
amendment,
which
does
require
exclusion
of
the
product
of
the
search.
the
trial
court
refused
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
moore
was
convicted.
ultimately,
however,
the
virginia
supreme
court
held
that
the
evidence
against
moore
should
have
been
excluded
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
overturned
his
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court.
we
conclude
that
when
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
has
committed
a
crime
in
their
presence
the
fourth
amendment
permits
them
to
arrest
a
person
and
to
search
him
in
order
to
safeguard
evidence
and
ensure
their
safety.
that
is
the
standard
we
have
set
forth
in
our
prior
cases
and
there
is
no
good
reason
to
alter
it
because
the
state
enacts
restrictions
on
arrest
authority
that
protects
its
citizen's
privacy
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires.
we
find
no
historical
support
for
the
proposition
that
the
fourth
amendment
incorporates
new
state
arrest
restrictions
and
more
fair
is
no
better
under
the
traditional
standards
of
reasonableness
that
we
have
applied
when
the
historical
record
yields
no
conclusive
answer.
we
have
said
in
the
past
that
the
balancing
of
government
and
individual
interests
is
not
in
doubt
when
an
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
person
committed
even
a
–
a
very
minor
crime
in
the
officer's
presence.
the
government's
interest
in
such
cases
are
sufficient
to
make
the
arrest
reasonable.
other
precedents
of
ours
indicate
that
state's
supplemental
protections
against
search
and
seizure
do
not
alter
the
constitutional
balance.
in
other
words,
a
search
or
seizure
maybe
constitutionally
reasonable
even
if
a
state
forbids
it.
we
adhere
to
this
approach
today
and
arrest
based
on
probable
cause
serves
interests
that
have
long
been
seen
as
sufficient
to
justify
the
seizure.
it
ensures
that
a
suspect
will
appear
to
answer
charges
and
that
he
will
not
continue
the
crime.
it
safeguards
evidence
and
it
enables
officers
to
conduct
an
in-custody
investigation.
if
a
state
decides
to
forego
arrest
supported
by
these
interests,
it
does
not
render
such
arrest
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
but
merely
places
a
high
premium
on
individual
privacy
than
the
fourth
amendment
requires.
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
state
privacy
protection
has
changed
the
constitutional
calculus,
we
would
often
frustrate
rather
than
further
state
policy.
states
could
create
new
–
new
protections
against
arrests
only
if
they
submitted
to
federally
prescribed
penalties
for
violation
of
those
protections,
notably,
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
exclusion
of
the
incriminating
evidence
derived
from
the
arrest.
as
i
noted
earlier,
virginia
law
would
not
impose
an
exclusionary
rule,
but
the
fourth
amendment
would
require
it
to
do
so.
some
states
might
conclude
that
the
added
privacy
protection
is
not
worth
the
cost.
incorporating
state
arrest
law
into
the
fourth
amendment
would
also
deserve
the
interest
in
bright-line
constitutional
rules
that
we
have
given
great
weight
to
in
the
–
in
the
fourth
amendment
context.
it
would
make
the
amendment's
protections
as
complex
and
unpredictable
as
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
a
particular
search
or
seizure
was
made
and
it
would
make
the
amendment's
protections
vary
from
place
to
place
and
time
to
time.
since
moore's
arrest
was
constitutional,
so
also
was
the
attended
search.
officers
are
entitled
to
perform
searches
incident
–
incident
to
constitutionally
permissible
arrests
in
order
to
ensure
their
own
safety
and
to
safeguard
evidence.
while
they
may
not
search
an
offender
whom
they
have
issued
a
citation
and
allowed
to
go
free,
that
rule
has
no
application
here.
the
officers
in
fact
arrested
moore
and
they
therefore
faced
the
risks
that
we
have
described
as
"an
adequate
basis
for
treating
all
custodial
arrests
or
alike
for
purposes
of
search
justification."
the
officers
violated
state
law
and
state
law
alone
by
failing
to
issue
moore
a
citation
and
send
him
on
his
way
and
it
is
up
to
virginia
to
remedy
that
violation
as
it
sees
fit.
if
he
wish
–
if
it
wishes
to
impose
an
exclusionary
rule,
it
may
do
so,
but
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
compel
that
course.
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
–
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
