justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
can
ask
you
sort
of
an
elementary,
stupid
question?
what
is
the
government's
theory
as
to
what
this
money
was?
is
it
the
theory
that
it
was
a
dividend
or
that
it
was
salary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
theory,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand,
it
was
not
salary;
it
was
not
a
dividend;
it
was
the
proceeds
of
an
embezzlement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
not
have
to
prove
that
it
was
income.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have
the
right
answer.
you
do
not
have
to
prove
that
it
was
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
maynard,
may
i
just
go
back
to
your
hypothetical
for
a
second?
in
the
closely
held
corporation
situation
you
describe
where
they
pay
a
huge
salary
to
the
wife
of
the
president
and
they
decide
you
can't
deduct
that,
that's
really
a
dividend...
that's
what
the
government
normally
does
in
that
situation.
and
don't
they
decide
it's
a
dividend
irrespective
of
the
intent
of
the
company
making
the
distribution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
them
to
satisfy
with
"respect
to
stock"
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
only
fact
and
circumstance
in
your
hypothetical
is
they
paid
them
a
million
dollars
when
they
only
earned
$100,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
clearly
with
respect
to
stock--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--regardless
of
intent?
