ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
government's
view,
to
make
a
sufficient
proffer
of
a
return
of
capital
defense
a
defendant
must
point
to
some
factual
evidence
to
support
three
elements:
first,
that
there
was
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
second,
that
the
corporation
lacked
earnings
and
profits
during
the
relevant
tax
years.
and,
third,
that
the
defendant
had
a
sufficient
basis
in
his
stock
to
cover
the
funds
received.
the
question
before
this
court
relates
to
the
first
element.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
the
government
here
believes
that
the
correct
test
is
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor.
the
government
believes
that
before
a
defendant
may
present
a
return
of
capital
defense
to
the
jury,
there
must
be
some
evidence
that
the
corporation
intended,
as
objectively
inferred
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
to
make
a
distribution
with
respect
to
its
stock
at
the
time
the
funds
were
taken.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in...
in
every
case,
your
honor,
the
question
about
whether
or
not
the
section
301
tax
treatment
applies,
the
government
believes
that
turns
on
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
that
there
must
be
some
facts
and
circumstances
suggesting
that
it
was
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that
is
half
of
the
understanding
of
the
term.
i
do
think
it
is,
as
petitioner
says,
a
term
of
art.
there
are
two
parts
to
the
term
of
art
with
respect
to
stock,
your
honor.
it
is,
as
you
say,
funds
that
you
receive
without
consideration.
but
it
is
also
funds
that
you
receive
solely
because
of
your
status
as
a
shareholder.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
that's--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
the
test
that
i'm
articulating
is
the
ninth
circuit's
test
in
this
circumstance,
your
honor.
in
miller,
which
is
the
genesis
of
the
ninth
circuit's
test,
the
court
said...
and
this
is
on
page
545
at
1214...
"we,
therefore,
conclude
that
whether
diverted
funds
constitute
constructive
corporate
distributions.
"
--and
that
would
include
dividends,
return
of
capital,
or
capital
gain...
"depends
on
the
factual
circumstances
involved
in
each
case
under
consideration.
"
and
then
it
went
on
to
say,
before
a
defendant
could
proffer
a
defense
of
return
of
capital,
the
taxpayer
had
to
make
some
demonstration
that
this...
such
distributions
were
intended
to
be
such
a
return
of
capital--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no.
you
may
not
know
at
the
time
the
funds
are
paid
whether
or
not
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
you...
if
you...
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say:
at
the
time,
was
it
intended,
as
objectively
manifested
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
to
be
a
distribution--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--but
if--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
could
be
a
return
of
capital
depending
on
the
person's
stock.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
here
he...
the
defendant--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
would
be
a
return...
but
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
test
is
whether
or
not
at
the
time
the
funds
were
taken,
the
corporation
intended
to
be
making
a
distribution
with
respect
to
its
stock.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
it
were
with
respect
to
stock
and
there
were--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--earning
profits,
and
it
was
then
income--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
at
the
time
the
corporation
made
a
distribution,
your
honor--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--it
depends
in
all
cases,
in
both
criminal
and
civil
cases...
and
in
that
sense
the
government
doesn't
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning...
in
all
cases
whether
or
not
something
gets
the
tax
treatment
set
forth
in
301(a)
depends
on
whether
or
not
it's
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
okay,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
it...
if
the
government...
if
it
was
intended
at
the
time
it
was
paid
out
to
either
be
a
dividend
or
return
of
capital
or
a
capital
gain--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
the...
with
respect
to
stock--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--i
think
if
the
court
chooses
to
read
their
test
that
rigidly,
i
don't
believe
that
the
petitioner
understood
it
that
way.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
must
not
understand.
there
are
three
elements.
i
want
to
make
clear
there
is
an
additional
element,
your
honor,
to
the
defense
than
the
two
you
laid
out.
that
there
would
also...
the
taxpayer
must
have
a
sufficient
basis
in
his
stock
to
cover
the
amount
of
the
diverted
funds
for
it
to
be
treated
as
a
return
of
capital.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
that's
how--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
one
reads
the
ninth
circuit's
test
that
rigidly--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--perhaps
that
would
be
right.
but
i
believe
if
one
looks
back
to
miller,
you
can
see
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
talking
about
whether
or
not
it
was
a
constructive
distribution.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
there
is
a
threshold
requirement
to
301
treatment,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
right.
and
there--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
right,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
if
he
had
testified
here
that
he
believed
he
was
receiving
a
dividend
at
the
time
he
took
these
funds,
we
believe
that
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
threshold
requirement.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
i
believe
you
can
tell
from
his
proffer,
your
honor,
that
he
understood
his
test
was
to
show
that
these
were
intended
to
be
some
sort
of
constructive
distributions.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in
the
ninth
circuit?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
a
criminal
case,
yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
in...
in...
the
rule
has
been
clear
in
the
ninth
circuit
since
1976
that
you
had
to
make
a
showing
that
there
was
an
intent
at
the
time
the
moneys
were
paid
to
make
a
constructive
distribution.
so,
no,
there
was
no
need
to
go
back
to
first
principles
and
argue
where
in
the
statute
that
rule
was
grounded;
but
the
government
has
made
this
argument
and
made
it
in
seeking
an
en
banc
prehearing
in
d'agostino,
in
1998.
this
is
not
a
new
argument.
when...
when
the
issue
was
reopened
and
they
sought
en
banc
review,
the
government--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
government's
theory
of
the
case,
your
honor...
but
i'd
like
to
step
back
and
explain
it
after
i
tell
you
what
it
was.
the
government's
theory
of
the
case
was
that
this
money
was
stolen
from
the
corporation.
but
in
a
criminal
case,
in
order
to
show
tax
a
deficiency
for
purposes
of
tax
evasion
or--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
was
as
we
argued
it
to
the
jury,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
need
in...
for
the
government
to
characterize
in
a
tax...
for
the
purposes
of
a
criminal
case,
this
court's
decision
in
holland
makes
clear
that
in
order
to
prove
the
tax
deficiency
element
of
a
tax
evasion
case,
or
here
a
false
statement
with
respect
to
income
for
the
false
return
counts,
the
government
need
prove
only
two
things:
one,
that
the
defendant
received
a
substantial
amount
of
funds
that
he
did
not
report
on
his
income
taxes.
and,
two,
that
the
funds
came
from
a
likely
source
of
taxable
income.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
has
to
prove
that
it
came
from
a
likely
source
of
taxable
income.
i
mean,
to
prove
that
here,
your
honor--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that
is
a
proof...
that
it's
income.
we
don't
have
to
label
what
type
of
income
it
is.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
fact
that
it's...
it's
income
to
him.
it
may
or
may
not
be
income
to
the
corporation.
we
also
believe
that
it
was
income
to
the
corporation.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
was
income
to
the
corporation,
your
honor,
even
here.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes.
it
should
have
been
income
to
the
corporation,
and--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--yes,
it
should
have
been.
yes,
your
honor,
it
should
have
been
taxable
income
to
the
corporation,
income
that
was
coming
to
the
corporation
that
he
diverted
before
it
hit
the
corporate...
just
before
it
hit
the
corporation's
books.
in
other
instances,
he
took
money
from
the
corporation
and
put
it
to
his
personal
use.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
the
government
retains
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
at
all
times,
your
honor.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
here
he...
in
order
to
make
the...
to
make
out
a
case,
to
be
allowed
to
present
a
defense
to
the
jury,
your
honor,
that
the
funds
are
nontaxable,
the
defense
must
have
some
basis
in
fact.
and
here
he
proffered
nothing
to
show
that
this
was
a
dividend
or
a
return
of
capital
at
the
time
it
was
made.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
it
is...
i
think
this
is,
in
his
proffer,
the
relevant
portion
of
it,
is
in
the
ja
on
page
97.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
and
it
says:
"alternatively,
the
expert
will
explain
that
if
the
moneys
were
not
loans
or
advances
or
if
boulware
did
not
use
the
moneys
for
corporate
purposes,
then
as
the
controlling
shareholder,
the
moneys
could
be
deemed
a
constructive
return...
a
constructive
dividend
or
return
of
capital
to
boulware,
which
may
or
may
not
be
income,
depending
on
whether
or
not
hie.
"
--the
corporation...
"had
earnings
and
profits
for
the
years
when
the
moneys
were
obtained
by
boulware.
"
that's
all
he
proffered,
an
expert
who
would
testify
that
it
could
have
been
either
dividends,
justice
breyer,
or
a
return
of
capital.
so
he
did
realize
that
he
needed
to
show--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
our
position
is
that
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
before
something
can
be
treated
under
the
tax
treatment
in
301(c),
it
must
meet
301(a),
which
requires
that,
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
it
in
fact
be
a
distribution,
either
a
dividend
or
return
of
capital.
and
all
his
proffer
testifies...
all
his
proffer
offered
is
that
it
theoretically
could
be
deemed
a
dividend
or
theoretically
could
be
deemed
a
return
of
capital.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
in
our
view,
301(a),
the
language
with
respect
to
stock,
and
the
regulations
have
so
interpreted
it
and
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
it
was
added
to
the
1954
code
specifically
to
show
that,
before
distributions
can
receive
that
treatment.
regardless
of
what
the
facts
are
about
e
and
p
and
regardless
of
what
the
facts
are
about
the
basis,
it
had
to
have
been
a
corporate
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
this
proffer
also
has
factual
proffers
in
it,
your
honor,
and
none
of
the
factual
proffers
go
to
the
fact
that
it
was
with
respect
to
stock.
the
petitioner
testified--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--he--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't.
for
corporate
purposes...
and
he
testified
here,
and
he
testified
as
to
those
three
things.
he
testified
that
he
thought
the
moneys
were
always
corporate
moneys.
in
other
words,
that
he'd
been
given
them
to
use
them
to
buy
coffee
and
do
other
things
that
were
for
the
corporation.
he
testified
that,
alternatively,
he
thought
they
were
loans
to
him
and
that
he
was
going
to
pay
them.
and
alternatively
he
thought
that
they
were
corporate
advances
to
him.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
all
those
things
and
rejected
them
in
convicting
him.
but
he
did
not
testify
that
he
thought
he
was
being
paid
a
dividend.
he
did
not
testify
that
he
thought
he
was
being
paid
a
return
of
capital.
and
the
reason
he
proffered
an
expert
is
because
he
doesn't
believe
there
is
this
first
element
of
the
defense,
at
bottom,
that
the
government
believes
that
there
is,
and
that
in
301(a)
the
threshold
requirement,
with
respect
to
stock...
and
if
you
trace
back
the
civil
cases,
and
the
basis
in
the
d'agostino
rule
is
based
on
civil
cases
interpreting
the
old
code--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
in
this
case
the
government's
position
at
bottom
is
that
he
stole
these
funds,
but
that...
but
in
the
criminal
case
it
didn't
need
to
characterize
it.
i
think...
and
if
i
can
take
a
common
criminal...
a
common
civil
situation,
your
honor,
where
a
corporation
comes
in
and
tries
to
deduct
a
salary
that
it
pays
to
a
controlling
shareholder
and/or
to,
say,
the
spouse
of
the
controlling
shareholder
who
is
also
a
shareholder,
and
the
services
that
that
person
has
provided,
the
corporation
has
called
it
a
salary
and
deducted
it
as
necessary
business
expenses,
and
the
service
comes
in
and
says
that's...
we're
going
to
disallow
that
deduction
and
then
that's
litigated
in
tax
court.
in
that
situation,
the
government
does
often
argue
that
that...
the
excess...
you
know,
say
this
person
at
home
is
providing
$10,000
in
bookkeeping
services
to
the
corporation,
when
in
fact
a
net
value,
a
net
worth,
fair
market
value
of
$10,000
of
services,
but
being
paid
$500,000,
and
the
corporation
is
deducting
it
as
a
necessary
business
expense
of
$500,000.
the
issue
in
that
case
will
turn
on
whether
or
not
there
was
an
intent
to
compense
for
services,
whether
or
not
the
services
are
reasonable,
and
the
government
may
well
come
in
and
say--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--you
know,
i...
to
be
honest
with
you,
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
but
the--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
government--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
government
might
want
to
take
that
position,
your
honor.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
government's
position
is
that
he
stole
these
funds.
but
in
a
hypothetical
situation
like
this
case,
if
the
government
wanted
to
take
a
position,
it
is
our
view
here
and
certainly
if
you
adopt
the
rule
that
we're
arguing
for,
that
301(a)...
that
there
must
be...
the
facts
and
circumstances
must
suggest
that
the
moneys
were
taken
out
with
respect
to
the
stock
because
of
the
person's
status
as
a
shareholder.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
well,
in
that
situation--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
the
express
intent,
your
honor,
is
belied
by
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
i
mean,
just
to
be
clear,
the
government
is
arguing
for
an
objective
test
here--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--right.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
yes.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
no,
your
honor.
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
would
show
that
the
expressed
intent
was
not
the
actual
intent
and
that
the...
what's
really
going
on...
and
that's
what
you're
asking
in
all
these
cases,
what's
really
going
on?
in
what
way
did
this
person
get
the
payment,
and
why
did
they
get
the
payment?
why
did
the
corporation
make
a
payment
to
this
person?
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
that's
the
language
on
which
i
rely
to
show
that
he's
proffered
nothing
in
basis
in
facts,
your
honor.
in
order
to
present
a
defense
to
the
jury--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--the
government
doesn't...
it's
clear
under
holland...
have
to
refute
every
hypothetical
nontaxable
source.
the
defendant
in
the
second
circuit's
leonard
decision
and
in
bok
makes
this
clear...
there
must
be
some
basis
on
fact.
and
this
is
just
an
expert
proffer.
he
already
knows
that.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
they
wish
to
introduce
expert
evidence
that
it
could
be
deemed,
as
a
legal
matter--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--they
don't
have--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--exactly,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
on
pet.
app.
6,
makes
that
clear.
boulware
presented
no
concrete
proof
that
the
amounts
were
considered,
intended.
or
recorded
on
the
corporate
records
as
a
return
on
capital.
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
but
that
fact
goes
to
the
second
element.
and
what
we're
disputing
is
sufficiency
on
the
first
element,
which
is
that
it
must
have
been
a
corporate
distribution
with
respect
to
the
corporation's--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--right,
your
honor.
and
he
presented
absolutely
no
factual
basis--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--if
you
were...
if
you
are
going
to
remand,
your
honor--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--well,
if
you're
going
to
remand,
your
honor,
all
three
elements
should
be
opened.
the
government's
view
is
that
he
knew
that
he
needed...
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
required
him
to
proffer
on
the
first
element,
that,
in
other
words,
that
it
was
intended
to
be
a
constructive
corporate
distribution
by
somebody,
that
is
any
evidence...
this
is
not
a
high
burden.
he
could
have
testified
he
thought
it
was
a
constructive
distribution
intent.
either
he
could
have
testified
it
was
a
dividend,
or
he
could
have
testified
he
thought
it
was
a
return
of
capital.
mr.
monago
also
testified,
your
honor,
that
it
was
not...
there
were
no
dividends
during
the
relevant
period.
so
there
is
testimony
in
the
government's
case
that
there
were
no
dividends
in
the
relevant
period
and
no
returns
of
capital
during
the
relevant
period.
and
he
proffered
no
basis
in
fact
to
believe
that
what
happened
here
nor
did
any
of
the
facts
that
suggest
what
happened
here,
unlike
in
our
excessive
salary
case,
your
honor,
where
the
government
books
it
as
a
deductible
business
expense,
and
one
can
infer
from
the
fact
that
it's
such
an
unreasonable
salary
that
it
must
have
been
earnings
and
profits.
here
the
facts
of
record
are
that--
ms.
deanne
e.
maynard
--there
is
no
way
to
infer
from
the
way
in
which
he
diverted
these
funds
that
these
funds
were
with
respect
to
stocks.
