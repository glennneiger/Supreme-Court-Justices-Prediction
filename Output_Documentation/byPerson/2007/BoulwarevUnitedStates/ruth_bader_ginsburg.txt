justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
perhaps
because...
because
the
government
might
very
well
be
on
the
other
side
of
that
question,
that
is
the
dominant
shareholder
takes
money
from
the
corporation,
gives
it
to
his
girlfriend,
and
the
government
is
saying
that
corporation
had
earnings
and
profits,
we
want
to
tax
this
as
a
dividend
to
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
did
say
something
about
the
interception
that...
your
argument
is
that
this
corporation
had
no
earnings
and
profits,
so
what
the
shareholder
got
was
a
return
of
capital.
but
part
of
what
was
involved
was
he
was
taking,
i
thought,
receipts
for
goods
that
customers
were...
had
paid
and
giving
them
to
the
girlfriend.
in
determining
whether
that
corporation
had
any
earnings
and
profits,
wouldn't
you
have
to
credit
the
corporation?
in
other
words,
did
you
prove
that
there
was
no...
that
there
were
no
earnings
and
profits?
you
would
have
to
prove
that,
wouldn't
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the...
the
government
did
say
that
this
accountant...
what
was
his
name,
monango,
or
something
like
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
testified
at
the
trial
that
there
was
no
return
of
capital
in
the
relevant
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
turned
out
that
there
were
earnings
and
profits
and
everything
else
was
the
same,
would
the
government
be
taking
the
position
that
the
proper
test
is:
was
this
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
government...
the
corporation
is
rich
with
earnings
and
profits.
would
the
government
be
saying:
oh,
aha.
so
we
have
to
go
through
the
motions
of
first
seeing
was
this
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock?
i
thought
that
the
idea
of
was
it
"a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
"
refers
to
was
it...
was
the
corporation...
was
there
to
be
any
quid
pro
quo?
that
is,
the
shareholder
gets
money
from
the
corporation.
is
the
shareholder
expected
to
pay
it
back,
or
is
it
just
that
it
comes
out
of
the
corporation
into
the
shareholder's
pocket
with
no
expectation
by
the
corporation
to
get
it
back?
i
thought
that
that's
what
"with
respect
to
stock"
means
instead
of
"with
respect
to
salary",
"with
respect
to
a
loan".
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
understanding
of
the
term.
am
i
wrong
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
anything
in
the
tax
court
at
all
that
used
the
words
as
having
any
significance
for
this
determination
whether
there
was
a
tax
evasion
here
with
respect
to
this
stock?
was
there
any...
any
hint
that
those...
those
words
were
controlling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
tax
court
originally.
was
this
a...
this
was
in
the
tax
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
criminal
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
in
the
trial
court
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
tell
me
about
the
civil
case?
there
would
be
a
tax
deficiency,
and
wouldn't
the
government
have
to
say
what
were
the
elements
of
the
tax
deficiency?
you
said
in
a
criminal
case
they
don't
have
to
characterize
it
at
all.
you
just
say
he
got...
he
has
money
on
which
tax
hasn't
been
paid,
and
there
was
a
likely
source
of
income.
but
now
you're
in
a
deficiency
mode,
and
the
government
asserts
a
deficiency.
doesn't
it
have
to
say
what
the
elements
of
the
deficiency
are?
and
what
would
it
say
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
this
case.
let's
take
this
case
and
not
some
hypothetical,
and
where...
on
the
civil
side...
the
government
is
asserting
a
deficiency.
just
change
one
thing.
the
corporation
is
rich
with
earnings
and
profits.
what
would
the
notice
of
deficiency
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
the
government
want
to
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
dividend
and
not
something
else,
if
that
were
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
were
earnings
and
profits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
recognize
that
he
would
have
the
burden?
if
he
said
this
corporation
had
no
earnings
and
profits
so
what
i
got
was
a
return
of
capital,
it
would
be
his
burden
to
show
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
coming
forward,
he
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward?
