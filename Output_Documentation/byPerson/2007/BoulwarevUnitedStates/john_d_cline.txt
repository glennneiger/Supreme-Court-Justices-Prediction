mr.
john
d.
cline
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
placed
the
phrase
301(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
make
clear
that
the
taxation
rules
in
section
301(c)
do
not
apply
to
corporate
payments
that
a
shareholder
receives
in
a
nonshareholder
capacity.
mr.
john
d.
cline
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
you
are.
mr.
john
d.
cline
[laughter]
although
i
agree
that
the
question
of
a
distribution
is
important,
and
i
think
implicit
in
that
question,
in
that
term,
although
the
courts
have
not
addressed
it,
is
some
sort
of
corporate
action.
where
you
have
a
controlling
shareholder,
as
we
do
here
with
mr.
boulware,
who
is
a
50
percent
share
owner,
he's
the
president,
he's
the
founder,
he
dominates
this
company,
his
action
is
action
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
mr.
john
d.
cline
with
respect,
justice
souter,
justice
souter,
i
disagree.
there
are,
i've
discovered,
hundreds
of
corporate
diversion
cases
involving
a
very
similar
fact
pattern
and
a
very
similar
fact
pattern
to
this,
where
have
you
a
corporation
that
is
really
the
creature
of
one
person.
it's
formed
by
one
person.
he
chose
the
corporate
form,
but
in
effect
he
is
the
corporation.
that's
the
case
of
mr.
boulware
and
it's
the
case
in
a
lot
of
these
diversion
cases,
and--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--it
is
indeed,
although
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
girlfriend,
according
to
the
government's
evidence,
received
a
very
large
chunk
of
this
money.
so
in
effect
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
you
not
only
have
a
50
percent
shareholder
who
dominates
the
corporation;
the
other
50
percent...
the
trustee
for
the
other
50
percent
shareholder
is
the
recipient
of
the
money
and
is
certainly
knowledgeable
about
most,
if
not
all,
of
what's
going
on.
but
in
these
circumstances
where
you
have
a
close
corporation
typically
run
very
informally,
as
this
one
was,
with
one
person
who
dominates
it,
the
courts
have
uniformly
taken
the
view
that,
the
tax
court
has
and
for
that
matter
the
government
has
in
every
case
except
this
one,
that
when
the
controlling
dominant
shareholder
takes
money
from
his
corporation,
that's
a
distribution
by
the
corporation.
and
although...
your
honor,
i
had
thought
about
this
question
myself
before
you
raised
it.
the
cases
don't
pause
on
that
issue.
they
move
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
taken
in
some
other
capacity,
as
compensation,
for
example,
or
as
a
loan.
mr.
john
d.
cline
well,
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
the
way
this
often
comes
up,
the
government
usually
takes
the
opposite
position--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--to
what
it's
taken
here.
it
usually
takes
our
position,
and
here's
the
reason
why:
first
of
all,
a
lot
of
times,
as
in
this
case,
some
of
the
money
that
is
coming
toward
the
corporation
is
intercepted
by
the
controlling
shareholder.
and
the
question
then
is,
was
it
ever
income
to
the
corporation?
well,
of
course,
the
government
wants
to
say
that
it
was
because
they
want
to
tax
it
twice,
at
the
corporate
level
and
then
again
at
the
individual
level.
and
the
issue
there
again
is
one
of
control.
if
it's
the
controlling
shareholder,
even
though
he
gets
the
money
before
it
ever
hits
the
corporate
bank
account.
it's
considered
income
to
the
corporation.
it
also
comes
up
when
the
corporation
wants
to
claim
a
theft
deduction
or
embezzlement
deduction.
that
again
is
a
common
fact
pattern
in
these
cases.
the
corporation...
everything
comes
to
light,
the
irs
conducts
its
investigation,
now
the
corporation
wants
to
avoid
its
tax.
sure
the
individual
is
going
to
get
taxed,
but
it
wants
to
avoid
its
tax.
and
so,
it
claims
that
there
was
a
theft
or
an
embezzlement
by
the
shareholder
and
it's
entitled
to
a
deduction
and
shouldn't
have
to
pay
tax
on
that
money.
and
again,
the
government
uniformly
takes
the
position
that
a
controlling
shareholder,
such
as
mr.
boulware,
can't
embezzle
from
his
own
corporation,
which
is
essentially
the
position
that
we're
taking
here.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
agree
with
that
point,
justice
souter.
but
one
other
point
i
would
emphasize
is
that
i
think
if
you
start
to
say
that
an
act
by
the
controlling
shareholder,
which
is
mr.
boulware,
does
not
constitute
a
distribution
by
his
corporation,
there
are
going
to
be
unintended
consequences
of
that.
one
of
which
is
that
in
a
situation
where
a
controlling
shareholder
such
as
mr.
boulware
intercepts
money
coming
into
the
corporation,
you're
going
to
have
the
corporation
coming
in
and
arguing
that
that
interception,
that
taking
in
of
money
wasn't
an
act
of
the
corporation,
and
so,
there
is
no
income
to
us.
and
i
think
that's
why
the
courts
in
a
whole
series--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
think
it
does.
mr.
john
d.
cline
the
way
i
believe
it
would
work
with
a
properly
instructed
jury
in
the
district
court
is
as
follows:
i
think
mr.
boulware
would
have
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
evidence
that
the
corporation
did
not
have
earnings
or
profits
and
that
his
basis
exceeded
the
amount
of
the
diversion.
i
think
at
that
point,
if
he
comes
forward
with
some
evidence,
and
bok
talks
about
this,
leonard
talks
about
this--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
cline
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
correct,
but
i'm
not
certain.
what
i
can
tell
you
about
earnings
and
profits
and
basis
as
well
is
this.
it
is
a
very
complicated
calculation,
and
i
think
it
would
be
hotly
disputed
in
the
district
court.
i
would
expect
the
government
to
argue
that
the
company
did
have
earnings
and
profits
and
that
mr.
boulware's
basis
is
less
than
he
contends
it
is.
i
think
it
would
ultimately
be
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
what
is
in
the
record,
and
it's
also
in
the
joint
appendix,
is
the
fairly
sketchy
evidence
of
both
basis
and
earnings
and
profits
that
was
introduced.
but
there
was
not
a
full
presentation
of
those
issues.
mr.
john
d.
cline
it
came
in...
i
must
say
it
came
in
more
or
less
by
happenstance,
because
neither
party
was
really
looking
at
the
question
of
earnings
and
profits
or
basis
because
the
trial
court
had
ruled
those
out.
but,
for
example,
on
cross-examination
i
believe
of
mr.
boulware's
accountant...
this
is
at
page
42
of
the
joint
appendix...
mr.
boulware's
lawyer
elicited
that
the
corporation
had
not
had
earnings
and
profits
during
the
years
in
question.
that
was
not
explored
at
all.
but
there
is
that
statement
in
the
record.
there
is
also...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
think
it
is
entirely
possible
that
under
hawaiian
law
a
minority
shareholder
or
noncontrolling
shareholder
who
was
treated
unfairly
by
the
controlling
shareholder
might
have
a
cause
of
action
under
state
law.
but
i--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--well,
except,
your
honor,
that
the
way
these
cases
have
played
out
is
that
there
are
numerous
cases,
dozens
of
them,
where
there
are
minority
shareholders
oftentimes
unwitting
of
what
the
majority
shareholder
is
using.
those
minority
shareholders
certainly
have
rights.
they
can
sue
under
state
law.
they
can
do
any
number
of
things.
but
their
rights
and
the
possible
violation
of
their
rights...
and
i
emphasize
possible,
because
no
one
has
ever
established
that
mr.
boulware
did
anything
wrong
with
respect
to
anyone...
those
don't
drive
the
federal
tax
treatment.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
think,
your
honor,
that
where
the
controlling
shareholder
of
the
corporation
does
something
with
corporate
funds,
and
in
this
case
transfers
them
to
himself,
i
think
that's
a
distribution.
and
i
think
that
it
is
properly
treated
under
federal
law,
under
federal
tax
law,
for
purposes
of
federal
tax
law
as
a
distribution
by
the
corporation.
mr.
john
d.
cline
well,
your
honor,
that
gets
back
to
where
i...
to
where
i
began
the
argument.
the
phrase
"with
respect
to
stock"
has
never
received
in
any
case
or
any
argument,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
significance
that
the
government
is
trying
to
accord
it
here.
what
that
phrase...
it
was
put
in
the
1954
code.
and
the
purpose
of
putting
it
in
the
code
was
simply
to
distinguish
transfers
to
shareholders
in
a
capacity
where
the
shareholder
is
effectively
returning
consideration...
shareholder
employees,
shareholder
vendors,
shareholder
creditors--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--because
the
issue,
your
honor,
is
not
the
recipient
of
the
funds.
i
mean,
the
money
is
going
to
be
taxed
to
mr.
boulware
if
it's
taxable
regardless
of
where
he
diverted
it.
for
example,
there
are
again
dozens
of
these
cases
where
controlling
shareholders
divert
corporate
assets
to
their
family
members,
and
the
issue
is
whether
it's
a
constructive
dividend
to
that
corporate
shareholder.
here
the
question,
regardless
of
where
mr.
boulware--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--absolutely.
the
government
in
every
case
says
yes.
mr.
john
d.
cline
well,
because,
your
honor,
they
want...
they
want
the
controlling
shareholder,
the
person
in
mr.
boulware's
situation,
to
pay
tax.
and,
of
course
in
most
cases...
in
most
cases,
again,
it's
to
the
government's
advantage
to
argue
the
position
that
we're
arguing
here.
and
the
reason
is
most
corporations
have
earnings
and
profits.
most
shareholders
don't
have
enough
basis
to
cover
their
tax
until
the
government
wants
to
hit
it
at
both
levels,
it
wants
the
corporate
tax
and
it
wants
the
individual
tax.
and
so,
it
argues
readily
that
this
is
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
that
phrase
was...
was
put
in
the
1954
code
to
distinguish
one
capacity
from
another.
the
government
has
argued
that
it
should
receive
some
sort
of
a
causal
type
meaning.
there
should
be
a
causal
link,
that
mr.
boulware
should
have
to
establish
that
he
received
the
stock
because
he
was
a
shareholder.
if
that's
the
standard,
first
of
all,
it's
a
different
standard
than
what
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
required
mr.
boulware
to
meet.
so
he
ought
to
have
a
chance
to
satisfy
the
standard.
second,
that
standard
doesn't
necessarily
require
any
form
of
intent.
there's
nothing
in
the
phrase
"with
respect
to
stock"
that
talks
about
intent.
mr.
john
d.
cline
absolutely,
your
honor.
what--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--the
government
could
argue
that,
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
to
say
i--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
would
be
astounded
if
they
took
that
position,
because
it
would
be
so
contrary
to
the
position
they
take
in
every
other
case.
but
to
get
back
to
your
basic
point,
yes,
mr.
boulware
was
asked
to
meet
a
standard
that
no
one
defends
in
this
court.
the
government
isn't
here
defending
the
intent
to
have
a
return
of
capital
standard.
and
part
of
the
reason
they
don't
defend
it
is
it's
an
impossible
concept.
you
don't
know
if
you
have
a
return
of
capital
until
you
know
if
you
have
a
dividend.
and
you
don't
know
that
until...
until
the
end
of
the
tax
year.
mr.
john
d.
cline
monago,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
cline
what
mr.
monago
testified
to
was
that
there
weren't
any
payments
out
of
the
capital
account,
and
that's
undisputed.
but
that's
not
the
question.
those
sorts
of
corporate
formalities
are
not
determinative,
or
even
particularly
helpful,
in
these
constructive
dividend
types
of
cases.
mr.
john
d.
cline
that
is
what
they're
arguing.
now,
two
things
about
that
justice
kennedy:
first,
that's
not
the
standard
mr.
boulware
was
required
to
meet
in
the
district
court.
the
standard
there
was
intent
that
it
be
a
return
of
capital.
and
that's
a
different
thing
than
an
intent
that
it
be
with
respect
to
stock.
an
intent
that
it
be
a
return
of
capital
suggests
that
you
know
what
a
return
of
capital
is.
you
know
about
earnings
and
profits.
you
know
about
basis.
and
i
can
tell
you
that
mr.
boulware,
who
was
an
unsophisticated
man,
didn't
know
any
of
those
things
at
the
time;
and
so,
of
course,
he
couldn't
meet
the
standard
he
was
required
to
meet.
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
the
government
that--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
don't
think
that's
the
right
standard,
but
even
if
this
court
decides
that
it
is,
that's
not
the
standard
mr.
boulware
was
required
to
meet
in
the
trial
court.
he
was
required
to
show
an
intent
that
it
be
a
return
of
capital,
and
he
couldn't
meet
that
standard.
if
this
court
were
to
decide...
and
i
suggest
it
would
be
the
wrong
standard,
but
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
the
correct
standard
were
an
intent
that
it
be
with
respect
to
stock,
mr.
boulware
could
meet
that
standard.
he
was
never
given
the
opportunity
to
meet
it
before,
but
he
could
meet
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
that
was
the
standard
in
the
sense
that
he
could
certainly
show
that,
to
the
extent
he
got
this
money
personally,
he
got
it
because
he
was
a
stockholder.
and
he
knew
he
was
getting
it
because
he
was
a
stockholder.
but
he
never
had
a
chance
to
meet
the
standard,
because
it
wasn't
the
standard
that
the
government
urged
in
the
trial
court
or
even
before
the
panel
on
appeal.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
d.
cline
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
quick
points.
the
phrase
"with
respect
to
stock"
was
never
discussed
in
the
district
court
at
all.
it
was
never
discussed
before
the
court
of
appeals
panel
at
all.
it
was
never
the
basis
in
the
lower
courts
for
the
government's
position
that
mr.
boulware
could
not
assert
a
return
of
capital
defense.
the
government's
sole
argument,
from
the
time
it
moved
to
exclude
mr.
boulware's
testimony
on
this
issue
and
his
evidence
on
this
issue
to
the
time
that
it
sought
to
prevent
him
from
getting
a
jury
instruction
on
this
issue,
the
government's
only
argument
was
miller,
and
in
particular
the
miller
requirement
that
there
be
an
intent,
a
contemporaneous
intent
that
the
distribution
be
a
return
of
capital.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
say
several
things,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
was
an
adequate
proffer
at
page
97
of
the
joint
appendix.
second,
at
pages
62
through
66
of
the
joint
appendix,
mr.
boulware
specifically
invokes
truesdell
and
the...
and
the
d'agostino
no
earnings,
no
profits--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--justice
kennedy,
there
actually
is
a
fair
amount
of
basis
data
in
the
record.
and
i
can
quickly
refer
the
court
to
the
portions
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
is
testimony,
for
example,
that
mr.
boulware
contributed
a
water
company
value
of
roughly
$1.7
million
to
hie.
that's
at
joint
appendix
70
through
73,
116
through
23,
147
through
51.
there's
evidence
that
he
contributed
a
coffee
processing
and
wholesaling
business
valued
at
roughly
$1.8
million.
that's
at
joint
appendix
123
through
27,
151
through
53.
there
was
evidence
that
he
spent
money
on
coffee
beans
for--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--justice
breyer--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--that's
how
i
read
the
portion
of
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
62
through
66
that
i
referred
to
where
mr.
boulware
invokes
that
rule.
now,
the
problem
here
was
that
at
no
point...
from
the
very
beginning,
the
government
brought
this
issue
to
fore
by
filing
a
motion
in
limine.
and
the
sole
focus
of
the
government's
motion
in
limine
was
the
miller
contemporaneous
intent
rule,
and
that
was
the
sole
focus
of
the
discussion.
that's
all
anyone
talked
about
in
the
district
court.
and
so,
justice
breyer,
the
proffer
is
not
as
wholesome
as
i
might
hope,
but
it's
clear
that
mr.
boulware
sought
the
opportunity
to
present
earnings
and
profits
and
basic
information
through
expert
testimony.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
under
the
rule
in
bok
and
under
the
rule
that
the
parties
proceeded
under
in
the
district
court
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
it's
the
correct
rule,
mr.
boulware
had
the
burden
of
producing
some
evidence,
some
evidence
of
the
earnings
and
profits
and
the
basis
issues.
then
the
burden
of
persuasion--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--just
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
some
evidence,
even
if
it's
weak
evidence
or
not
credible
evidence,
just
to
put
the
issue
in
play.
then
the
burden
of
persuasion
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
rests
with
the
government.
mr.
john
d.
cline
the
evidence,
your
honor,
is
in
the
record
where
i
have
previously
identified.
mr.
john
d.
cline
actually,
your
honor,
it
was...
it
was...
the
evidence
that
came
into
the
record
came
into
the
record
more
or
less
by
happenstance
because
the
district
court
had
prohibited
any
evidence
of
return
of
capital.
mr.
john
d.
cline
no.
it
came
in
throughout
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cline
no.
the
motion
was
actually
filed
june
30th,
which
is,
i
think,
the
third
day
of
trial.
the
issue
was
litigated
continuously
throughout
the
trial
up
until,
i
think,
july
11th,
which
was
a
day
or
two
before
it
ended.
this
issue
came
up
repeatedly
throughout
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cline
justice
breyer,
had
the
issue
not
been
limited
to
the
miller--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
believe
that
mr.
boulware
would
have
presented
expert
testimony
that
would,
in
fact,
have
at
least
put
into
play
the
issue
of
earnings
and
profits
and
basis.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
think
that's
basically
right,
justice
souter,
and--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--yes,
but--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--i
think
so,
justice
souter,
and
i
think--
mr.
john
d.
cline
--that
he
is
a
stockholder,
and
that
he
did
not
receive
this
money
in
any
nonstockholder
capacity.
mr.
john
d.
cline
for
example,
for
income
or
something
like
that.
and
i
think
the
record
is
probably
adequate
as
it
stands.
now,
he
was
clearly
a
stockholder.
he
would
not
have
received
this
money
had
he
not
been
a
stockholder.
mr.
john
d.
cline
chief
justice
roberts,
the
cases,
again,
are
uniform...
and
we
cite
them,
i
think,
at
footnote
8
of
our
reply
brief...
that
you
can
have
a
constructive
distribution
even
if
there
are
no
corporate
formalities,
even
if
it's
a
disproportionate
distribution,
even
if
other
stockholders
don't
share
it.
and,
again,
that's
a
position
that
the
government
argues.
mr.
john
d.
cline
i
believe
it
is...
the
cases
are
cited,
i
believe,
at
footnote
8
of
our
reply
brief.
let
me
just
make
sure.
mr.
john
d.
cline
it's
footnote
3...
i'm
sorry.
it's
footnote
3
on
page
8,
and
there
is
a
whole
series
of
cases.
and,
again,
as
far
as
i
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
law
to
the
contrary,
and
this
is
a
position
that
the
government,
itself,
argues.
mr.
john
d.
cline
but,
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
prevail
only
in
this
case,
and
i
would
be
astonished
if
counsel
argues
that
the
government
views
mr.
boulware
as
having
stolen
this
money
from
the
corporation.
i
would
be
astonished
if
the
government
would
accept
a
theft
deduction,
if
hie
argued
for
it,
when
the
government
seeks
to
collect
these...
the
corporate
income
from
hie.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions--
