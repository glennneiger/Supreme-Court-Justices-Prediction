justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
that.
the
ninth
circuit
said,
quote,
about
what
he
has
to
show,
that
he
has
to
show
not
merely
that
the
funds
could
have
been
a
return
of
capital,
but
that
the
funds
were,
in
fact,
the
return
of
capital
"at
the
time
of
transfer".
then,
they
go
on
to
say,
since
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
were
considered,
intended
or
recorded
on
the
corporate
records
as
a
return
of
capital
at
the
time
they
were
made,
then
it
isn't
a
return
of
capital.
now,
i
thought
everybody
thinks
that's
wrong,
because
you
might
have
an
absolute
distribution
that
absolutely
counts
as
a
distribution
to
every
shareholder
in
the
corporation.
and
at
the
time
they
all
think
the
company's
going
to
make
a
billion
dollars,
but
it
just
turns
out
that
they
have
a
loss
of
a
billion
dollars,
in
which
case
at
the
end
of
the
tax
year
that
would
count
as
a
return
of
capital
if
the
basis
were
high
enough,
and
it
would
not
count
as
a
dividend.
am
i
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
so
if
we
do
not
know,
that's
the
end
of
the
ninth
circuit
test,
isn't
it?
because
the
ninth
circuit
test
says:
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
books
at
the
time
of
the
distribution
and
see
if
it
is
entered
on
those
books
as
a
return
of
capital.
that's
how
i
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
was
not.
what
they
thought
at
the
time
they
distributed
it
was
fabulous
dividends
because
we
are
going
to
be
rich.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
example
was
they
just
made
a
little
mistake.
instead,
the
corporation
is
close
to
bankrupt,
so
there
are
no
earnings
or
profits.
is
it
then
a
return
of
capital
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
basis?
he
has
more
than
enough
basis.
he
has
a
$14
trillion
basis,
okay?
so
there
is
no
problem
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
so
it
is
a
return
of
capital.
so,
therefore,
the
test
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
try
a
third
example?
because
i
think
an
example
might
help.
let
us
imagine
that
the
company
distributes
$10,000
on
june
1
to
every
shareholder.
let
us
imagine
that
every
shareholder
has
a
basis
of
a
trillion
dollars
in
his
stock.
there
is
no
problem
about
basis.
there
is
no
problem
about
the
nature
of
the
distribution.
let
us
imagine
they
put
in
the
corporate
records
on
june
1:
this
is
a
very
valuable
corporation;
we
are
going
to
make
a
fortune;
and
this
is
a
dividend.
they
write
it
down.
now,
unfortunately,
four
weeks
later
the
bottom
falls
out
of
the
market,
and
it
is
not
a
dividend
for
the
reason
that
they
have
no
profits
that
year.
now,
is
it
not
under
ordinary
tax
law
a
return
of
capital?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that...
once
you
say
yes,
then
the
ninth
circuit
must
be
wrong
because
the
ninth
circuit
said
we
do
not
look
to
see
what
happens.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
month
later,
we
look
just
to
see
how
it's
characterized
by
the
corporation
at
the
moment
of
the
transfer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
what
they
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
don't...
we
are
not
certain
on
that
one,
i
think,
because
of
the
cases
he
said
before
would
this
be
a
possible
holding.
if
it
was
a
distribution
in
respect
to
the
stock,
and
if
he
had
sufficient
basis,
then
if
there
were
no
earnings
and
profits
in
the
corporation
during
the
year,
it
would
be
treated
as
a
tax
deficiency...
no
tax
deficiency
or
it
would
be
a
return
of
capital.
insofar
as
as
the
ninth
circuit
says
something
to
the
contrary,
it
is
wrong.
now,
if
we
remand
to
decide
whether
the...
whether
he
intended
to
prove
and
produced
enough
to
show
they
didn't
have
the
earnings
and
profits
and
also
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
distribution
in
respect
to
stock.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
the
government
have
any
objection
to
what
i
just
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
those
are
different.
those
are
whether
that's
a
corporate
purpose.
i
think
the
question
here
is,
as
i
started,
i
thought
that
this
expert
was
going
to
testify
that
there
were
no
earnings
and
profits
in
the
relevant
year.
having
read
it
more
closely,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
what
the
expert
is
going
to
testify.
rather,
he's
going
to
say
if
there
were
no
earnings
and
profits,
then
it
is
a
return
of
capital
if
the
basis
is
high
enough.
he's
going
to
testify
to
that
legal
proposition.
so,
my
question
is,
is
there
any
proffer
of
evidence
here
where
the
taxpayer
says
i
want
a
chance
to
show
there
were
no
earnings
or
profits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
did
happen
there?
i've
been
looking
at
page
62
through
66.
they
are
dancing
around
the
issue.
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
wouldn't
be
having
these
four
pages
unless
they
are
thinking
of
return
of
capital
as
a
defense,
but
they
don't
actually
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would
have
raised
it.
