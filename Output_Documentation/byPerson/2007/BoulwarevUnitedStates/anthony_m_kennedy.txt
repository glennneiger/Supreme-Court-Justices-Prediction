justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
also
wanted
to
know
whether
there
is
in
the
record
the
corporation's
balance
sheet?
it
was
frankly
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
this
was
not
in
excess
of
basis.
you
don't
usually
capitalize
corporations
for
$10
million.
but
i
don't
have
any
basis
other
than
just
an
assumption
to
make
that
observation.
is
the
corporate
balance
sheet
with
the
capital
structure
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
it
introduced
by
the
government
or
by
the
defendant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not,
i'm
not
sure
if
what
the
government
is
maintaining
here
is
so
prejudicial
to
its
position
in
other
cases,
which
was
the
earlier
discussion
we
were
having.
here
there
is
simply
nothing
on
the
corporate
records
to
show
that
this
was
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
i
don't
care
whether
this
is
earnings
and
profits
or
in
excess
of
basis.
but
there's
just
no
indication
of
the
distribution
with
respect
to
stock,
and
you
have
two
shareholders.
under
hawaiian
law,
can
you
make
a
disproportionate
distribution
to
shareholders
so
one
person
gets
capital
back
and
the
other
doesn't
and
there's
no
redemption
of
shares?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was,
that
was
the
qualification
that
the
second
circuit
made
in
its
d'agostino
case.
it
said
if
there's
a
violation
of
corporate
law
then
our
rule
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
whole
point.
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
show
this
as
a
distribution
indicates
that
he
couldn't
do
this
under
federal
law,
so
it
must
be
something...
under
state
law,
so
it
must
be
something
other
than
a
distribution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
the
government's
intent
test,
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
calendar
year
and
the
distribution
is
made
in
june,
that
the
government
could
say:
what
we
want
to
show...
we
want
you
to
show
that
there
was
an
intent
to
make
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock
at
that
time.
whether
or
not
it
was
a
dividend,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
return
of
capital,
we
won't
know
until
the
end
of
the
year.
i
suppose
they
could
try
to
argue
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
to
say
the
government
can't
argue
that
this...
the
defendant
has
to
show
that
it
was
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock
and
that
that
was
his
intent.
whether
or
not
it
was
a
dividend,
whether
or
not
it
was
a
return
of
capital,
we
wait.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
response
to
justice
stevens,
once
you
show
that
it
was
from
a
likely
source
of
income
that
he
received
it,
it's
unreported,
then
it's
the
defendant's
burden
to
go
ahead
and
show
this
was
a
301
distribution,
that
i
had
a
basis
that
absorbed
it,
that
there
were
no
earnings
and
profits.
that's
all
for
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
get
something
clear.
they
wish
to
introduce
evidence.
and
you
say,
oh,
well,
the
proffer
is
no
good
because
there
is
no
basis,
so
there
was
no
evidence.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
say
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
expert
could
use
for
that
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
97,
are
you
saying
that
the
expert
would
have
brought
with
him
financial
records
to
show
earnings
and
profits
and
basis?
because
i
interpret
the
government
as
saying
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
testify
to
because
there
was
no
other...
the
basic
value
was
not
in
the
record.
