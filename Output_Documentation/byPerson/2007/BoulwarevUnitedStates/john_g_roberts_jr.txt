chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1509,
boulware
v.
united
states.
mr.
cline.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
don't...
and
this
may
be
the
point
that
you
just
made,
but
i
want
to
clarify
it.
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
this
diversion
was
with
respect
to
stock,
because
you
put
that
at
issue,
and
you
weren't
allowed
to
make
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
suppose
it
would
be
open
on
remand
for
the
government
to
argue
it
was
not
with
respect
to
stock
for
the
reasons
that
have
come
out,
that
it
was
just
a
diversion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cline.
ms.
maynard.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court
didn't
let
the
taxpayer
submit
evidence.
he
came
forward
and
said:
look,
there's
an
issue
here
despite
the
return
of
capital.
i
would
have
thought
at
that
point
the
burden
shifted
to
you
again.
that
burden...
having
met
that
burden
of
production
or
at
least
tried
to,
the
burden
would
shift
to
you
to
show,
no,
it's
not
a
return
of
capital,
it's
a
dividend.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
said
in
his
proffer
that
he
would
present
expert
testimony
that
this...
the
corporation
didn't
have
profits
and
earnings,
and
therefore
it
was
a
return
of
capital.
and
the
district
court
said
no,
you
don't
get
to
do
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
mean,
the
district
court...
the
district
court
said
that's
not
relevant,
it's
not
relevant
whether
they
could
be
classified
as
dividends.
i'm
quoting
from
your
brief
on
page
8:
"it
is
not
relevant
whether
the
funds
could
have
been
classified
as
a
return
of
capital
or
a
dividend
at
the
time
when
they
were
diverted.
"
because,
he
said,
what
was
relevant
is...
is
the
intent,
whether
they
were
in
fact
treated
as
return
of
capital.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
he
is
making
a
profit
and
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
there's
adequate
earnings
or
not,
isn't
he
plainly
saying
that
that
means
it's
with
respect
to
my
stock?
because
if
he
were
getting
it,
for
example,
as
an
employee
for
consideration,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
there
was
sufficient
earnings
or
not.
but
when
he
says
it
depends
on
whether
there's
sufficient
earnings,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
clearly
notifying
you
that
he's
saying
it's
with
respect
to
his
stock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
he's
presented
the
argument,
but
don't
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
as
an
element
of
tax
deficiency
that
what
he's
proffering
there
is
not
true?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
not
right.
he
says
right
here
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
income
depending
on
a
fact,
not
an
expert's
opinion,
whether
or
not
hie
had
earnings
and
profits
for
the
years
when
the
moneys
were
obtained
by
boulware.
that's
a
question
of
fact.
you
look
at
the
corporate
books.
you
get
the
accountant
on
to
testify.
it's
not
an
expert's
view
on
what's
legally
relevant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
totally
relevant
if
the
question
he
is
trying
to
submit,
whether
they
are
earnings
or
profits
or
not,
which
will
affect
its
treatment.
it's
only
relevant
if
it's
with
respect
to
stock.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
please--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
ms.
maynard.
mr.
cline,
you
have
four...
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
that
evidence?
if
he
has
the
burden
of
coming
forward
with
it,
i
assume
that
means
in
the
proffer.
and
where
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer's
point
is
that
that
isn't
directed
to
that
issue.
it's
directed
to
the
issue
of
whether
he
was
using
the
funds
for
a
corporate
purpose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
evidence
came
in
after
the
proffer,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
motion
in
limine
which
is
before
the
trial.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
kind
of
hard
to
say
it's
with
respect
to
stock
when
the
other
stockholder
doesn't
get
any.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
page
in
your
brief
did
you
say?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
of
your
reply
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
