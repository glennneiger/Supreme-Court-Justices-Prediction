justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
which
is
going
to
come
up
sooner
or
later?
and
it's
kind
of
a
threshold
question.
so,
if
i
may,
let
me
interrupt
you
with
it
now.
you
emphasize
the
significance
of
the
limiting
condition
"with
respect
to
the
stock".
but
before
you
get
to
that
phrase,
section
301
refers
to
a
distribution
by
the
corporation.
and
my
question
is
this:
let's
assume
that
we...
we
accept
your...
your
position
that
the
circuit
was
wrong
in
requiring
an
offer
of
proof
of
intent
to
return
capital.
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
you
would
still
have
an
obligation,
if
you're
going
to
take
advantage
of
this
section,
to
offer
some
evidence
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
corporate
distribution
involved?
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
evidence
is
or
the
government's
evidence
and
yours
is
that,
you
know,
there
was
skimming,
there
was
misdirection,
et
cetera,
but
there
was
no
indication,
there's
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
distribution,
in
the
normal
sense
of
that
word,
by
a
corporation.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you...
if
you
win
the
case
in
the
sense
of
convincing
us
that
the
circuit
was
wrong
with
respect
to
the
specific
intent
requirement,
you
would
still
be
left
without
a
defense
because
you
have
not
come
forward
with
any
evidence
that
indicates
a
distribution.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
certainly
can
be,
and
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
isn't
there
some
point
of
informality
or
some
point,
i
guess,
of
formality
or
relevance
to
corporate
practice
that
has
to
be
reached?
in
other
words,
he
may
keep
lousy
books,
he
may
be
very
sloppy,
but
directing
funds
to
one's
girlfriend
is
not
the
act
of
a
corporation.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
kind
of...
of
actions
that
he
took
to
get
or
to
direct
the
payment
of
moneys
could
not,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
be
regarded
as
an
act
of
this
corporation
or
of
any
corporation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
this
case,
he's
a
50
percent
owner,
as
i
understand
it.
he
formed
the
corporation,
but
isn't
50
percent
of
the
stock
owned
by
the
trust
for
the
love
child
of
him
and
the
girlfriend?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
be
that
he
cannot
embezzle
in
the
sense
of
committing
a
separate
private
act
or
even
a
separate,
a
separate
tort
that
the
corporation
could
object
to.
but
the
question
still
remains...
excuse
me...
whether
the
act
of,
of
taking
the
money
in
this
unorthodox
way
could
be
regarded
as
a
corporate
act
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
"distribution".
and
i
think
i
understand
your
point,
but
i
guess
the
only
point
that
i'm
making
is
the
fact
that
it
may
not
qualify
as
embezzlement,
civilly
or
criminally,
does
not
necessarily
answer
the
objection
that
i'm
raising.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
explains
why
i'm
making
the
argument
and
the
government
wasn't
in
its
brief?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
you...
aren't
you
saying
not
that
the...
that
the
test
of
intent
that
the
ninth
circuit
used
is,
in
itself,
a
sufficient
test;
but
that,
rather...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
because
i
thought
this
was
the
basis
really
of
your
argument.
i
thought
the
government,
in
effect,
was
saying
in
order
to
treat
it
as
a
return
of
capital,
it
is
a
necessary
condition
that
it
be
intended
to
be
treated
as
a
return
of
capital.
but
that
is
not
a
sufficient
condition,
because
if,
in
fact,
it
turns
out,
as
in
justice
breyer's
example,
that
there
are
no
earnings,
then
under
301
it
can't
be
treated
as...
as
a
dividend.
and
only
then,
under
301,
would
it
be
treated
as
a
return
of
capital.
so
the
conditions
are,
no.
1
necessary
intent;
no.
2,
a
determination
at
the
end
of
the
year
that,
in
fact,
there
were
no
earnings.
conversely,
if
at
the
end
of
the
year
there
are
profits,
even
though
the
first
necessary
condition,
intent,
was
satisfied,
under
301
that
would
not
be
enough;
and
the
government
would
treat
it
as
income.
isn't
that
the
nub
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
i...
let
me...
i
just
want
to
get
clear
on
how
you
understand
it.
i
gave
you
one
alternative
in
which
you
defend
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
scalia
has
given
you
another
alternative
in
which
you
don't
defend
the
ninth
circuit.
which...
which
are
you
going
to
take?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
why
talk
about
that
at
all?
i
mean,
on
justice
breyer's
third
and
simplest
example,
he
is
basically
saying
let
section
301
make
the
determination,
in
effect,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
when
we
know
what
the
actual
situation
of
the
corporation
is.
if
you
wait
and
see,
301
takes
care
of
it,
and
you
don't
have
to
get
into
the...
sort
of
the
metaphysics
of
intent.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
distribution
with...
distribution
with
respect
to
stock.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
think
he
was
assuming
and
i'm
assuming
that...
that
that
condition
is
met.
but,
in
order
to
meet
that
condition,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
that
the...
on
the
part
of
the
corporation
that
the
distribution
either
be
a
return
of
capital
or
that
the
distribution
either
be
a
dividend.
it
simply
has
to
be
a
distribution
to
this
guy
because
he
is
a
stockholder.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
income
to
him.
you
would
be
taking
a
different
position
if
you
thought
you
could
attribute
it
to
the
corporation
and
tax
the
corporation,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
if
you
want
to
go
after
the
corporation,
you
are
specifically
going
to
take
the
position
in
this
guy's
case
that,
in
fact,
it
was
income
to
the
corporation.
if
there
is
no
income
to
the
corporation,
then
you
don't
care,
and
that's
the
situation
you're
in
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
was
not
profits;
it
was
not
taxable
income.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
was
not
taxable
income.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
maybe
he
was
simply
getting
at
the
fact
that
under
301,
assuming
the
possibilities
of
non-301
treatment
are
excluded,
under
301
it
will
be
treated
either
as
a
dividend
or
as
a
return
of
capital,
depending
on
the
corporate
books
for
that
year,
and
he
wasn't
making
a
proffer
at
that
point
precisely
as
to
what
those
corporate
books
would
show,
but
he
was
making
a
proffer
that,
under
301,
it
would
either
be
classified
as
a
dividend
or
as
a
return
of
capital.
and
wasn't
that
enough
to...
to
get
him...
get
him
the
right
to
introduce
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
am
i...
am
i
right
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
satisfy
that
burden
would
be
this:
he
would
have
the
option,
which
i
gather
he
availed
himself
of,
to
show
that,
in
fact,
the...
the
funds
were
loans
or
non-income
to
him.
and
he
would
also
have
had
the
option
to
follow
that
by
putting
on
the
corporate
accountant
saying:
this
guy
is
a
stockholder.
it's
what
the
corporate
books
show.
in
fact,
that's
not
in
dispute.
no.
2,
the
corporation
didn't
have
any
profits
that
year.
no.
3,
if
the
money
was
diverted,
if
the
money
was
corporate
funds,
the
only
thing
left
under
301
is
to
treat
it
as
a
return
of
capital.
and
if,
in
fact,
the
funds
exceeded
his
basis,
to
treat
it
as
a
capital
gain.
so
all
he
had
to
do,
in
effect,
to
make
the
proffer,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
say:
if
you
don't
believe
me
that
this
was
non-income
like
a
loan,
then
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
put
in
the
evidence
that
the
corporation
didn't
have
any...
any
profits
that
year,
and
section
301
will
take
care
of
the
rest
of
it.
because
you
have
to
conclude
that
it's
either
a
return
of
capital
or
a
capital
gain.
is
that
fair?
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't...
doesn't
he
suffice,
on
a
going
forward
burden,
simply
to
show
that
he
is
a
stockholder?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
but
doesn't
he
make
it
at
least
to
the
point
of
putting
the
government
to
its
proof
by
showing
that
he
is
a
stockholder?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
michael
boulware,
was
charged
for
several
counts
of
tax
evasion
and
filing
false
income
tax
returns,
stemming
from
his
diversion
of
funds
from
hawaiian
isles
enterprises,
a
closely
held
corporation
of
which
he
was
the
president,
founder
and
controlling
shareholder.
at
trial,
the
united
states
sought
to
establish
that
boulware
had
received
taxable
income
by
systematically
diverting
funds
from
the
corporation.
in
defense,
boulware
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
that
the
corporation
had
no
retained
or
current
earnings
and
profits
in
the
relevant
taxable
years
with
the
consequence
he
argued
that
he,
in
effect,
received
distributions
of
property
that
must
have
been
returned
to
the
capital.
under
sections
301
and
316(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
return
of
capital
is
non-taxable
up
to
a
shareholder's
basis
in
--
in
his
shares
and
boulware,
therefore,
argued
that
the
government
could
not
establish
a
tax
deficiency
required
to
convict
him.
the
district
court
rejected
this
defense,
and
the
jury
found
boulware
guilty.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
its
earlier
decision
in
united
states
v.
miller
in
which
the
court
held
that
before
a
distributee
accused
of
criminal
tax
evasion
may
claim
return
of
capital
treatment,
he
needs
to
present
evidence
that
either
he
or
the
corporation
intended
a
capital
return
when
the
distribution
occurred.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
such
a
showing
a
contemporaneous
intent
is
required.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
no
such
showing
is
required
and
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
miller's
view
that
a
criminal
defendant
may
not
treat
a
distribution
as
a
return
of
capital
without
evidence
of
a
corresponding
contemporaneous
intent
sits
uncomfortably
not
only
with
the
tax
law's
economic
realism
but
with
the
particular
wording
of
301
and
316(a)
as
well.
as
those
sections
are
written,
the
tax
consequences
of
a
distribution
by
a
corporation
with
respect
to
stock
depends
not
on
anyone's
purpose
to
return
capital
or
to
get
it
back,
but
on
facts
wholly
independent
of
intent,
whether
the
corporation
had
earnings
and
profits
and
the
amount
of
the
taxpayer's
basis
for
his
stock.
when
the
miller
court
went
the
other
way,
needless
to
say,
it
could
claim
no
textual
hook
for
the
contemporaneous
intent
requirement,
but
argued
for
it
as
the
way
to
avoid
two
supposed
anomalies.
first,
the
court
thought
that
applying
301
and
316(a)
in
criminal
cases
unnecessarily
emphasizes
the
exact
amount
of
the
deficiency
while
ignoring
the
element
of
the
defendant's
willful
intent
to
evade
taxes,
but
the
element
of
willfulness
is
addressed
at
trial
simply
by
requiring
the
government
to
prove
it,
and
nothing
in
301
and
316(a),
as
written,
relieves
the
government
of
this
burden
of
proving
willfulness
or
impedes
it
from
doing
so
if
the
evidence
is
there.
second,
the
miller
court
worried
that
if
the
defendant
could
claim
capital
treatment
without
showing
a
corresponding
contemporaneous
intent,
tax
treatment
of
the
evasively
inclined
could
turn
on
whether
the
distributing
corporation
happened
to
find
itself
in
the
midst
of
financial
difficulty,
but
there
is
no
criminal
tax
evasion
without
a
deficiency
and
there
is
no
deficiency
owing
to
a
distribution
received
with
respect
to
stock
if
a
corporation
has
no
earnings
and
profits
and
the
value
distributed
does
not
exceed
the
taxpayer-shareholder's
basis
for
his
stock.
thus
the
acquittal,
miller
worried
about,
would
in
fact
result
nearly
from
the
government's
failure
to
prove
an
element
of
the
crime.
we
hold
that
miller
was
mistaken
in
requiring
a
contemporaneous
intent
to
treat
the
receipt
of
corporate
funds
as
a
return
of
capital.
and
the
government
has
raised
nothing
that
calls
for
affirmance
in
the
face
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reliance
on
miller
in
this
case.
although
it
argues
that
boulware
may
not
have
satisfied
301(a)'s
requirement
that
a
distribution
be
made
with
respect
to
stock,
this
is
not
the
time
or
the
place
to
home
in
on
that
limitation.
the
facts
in
this
case
have
yet
to
be
raked
over
with
the
stock
ownership
condition
in
mind,
and
if
consideration
is
to
be
given
to
that
condition
now,
the
canvas
of
evidence
in
boulware's
proffer
should
be
made
by
a
court
familiar
with
the
whole
evidentiary
record.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
diversions
of
hie
funds
were
in
fact
unlawful
and
the
301
and
the
316(a)
are
inapplicable
to
illegal
transfers,
but
we
decline
to
take
up
that
question
which
was
not
considered
by
the
ninth
circuit.
we
vacate
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion
which
is
unanimous.
