justice
antonin
scalia
for
which
purpose
you
would
include
the
receipts
that
he
sent
to
his
girlfriend
instead
of
putting
them
in
the
corporate
treasury?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
less
concerned
with
the
word
"distribution"
in
the
statute
than
i
am
with
the
phrase
"with
respect
to
its
stock"...
"distribution
made
by
a
corporation
to
a
shareholder
with
respect
to
its
stock.
"
now,
the
court
below
held
that
there
had
to
be
a
conscious
intent
to
return
capital.
even
if
i
disagree
with
that
and
think
that
that
was
wrong,
isn't
the
government
right
that
it
nonetheless
is
the
burden
to
establish
that
the
distribution
here
was
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock,
and
the
distribution
was
given
to
the
girlfriend
who
owns
no
stock
in
the
corporation.
how
does
it
become
a
distribution
with
respect
to
stock?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
girlfriends.
i
mean,
why
doesn't
it
distinguish
a
girlfriend
as
much
as
it
distinguishes
an
employee
who's
receiving
back
a
loan?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
government
would
say
yes?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
they're
really...
they're
really
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
on
this
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
pretty
sure
they
won't.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
below
didn't
give
him
a
chance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
establish
that.
the
court
below
required
him
to
show
an
intent
to
distribute
capital.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
was...
we're
just
not
on
the
same
page
here.
that's
not
what
the...
the
decision
you're
defending
said.
the
decision
you're
defending
did
not
say
that
it
was
incumbent
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
with
respect
to
stock.
they
said
it
was
incumbent
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
it
was
intended
to
be
a
return
of
capital.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
just
a
wholly
different
issue,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
best
you
can
get
out
of
this
case,
the
way
you're
arguing
it,
is
a
remand
for
them
to
apply
the
proper
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
that.
then...
then,
you
would
say,
when
it
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution
for
failure
to
pay
taxes,
so
long
as
somebody,
when
they
take
the
money,
intended
it
to
be
a
return
of
dividends,
it
does
not
become
a
return
of
capital.
are
you
sure
you're
willing
to
live
with
that
intent
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
time...
is
it
important
for
the
tax
treatment
that
at
the
time
of
the
distribution
it
be
intended
to
be
either
a
return
of
capital
or
dividends?
does
that
make
the
difference
as
to
whether
you're
going
to
be
able
to
tax
it
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not...
we
are
not
talking
about
distribution.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
talking
about
the
intent
that
it
be
a
return
of
capital
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be
anything
at
all.
so
in
other
words,
there
is
no
preliminary
requirement
that
you
intend
that
it
be
a
return
of
capital.
right.
so
if
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
here,
it
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wants
a
chance
to
argue
that.
he
was
not
given
a
chance
to
argue
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said...
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
enough
to
put
you
on
notice...
"boulware
will
present
further
evidence
that
all
of
the
alleged
unreported
income
was
either
a
loan
or
advance
or
was
used
by
boulware
for
corporate
purposes
or
for
the
benefit
of
hie.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
"for
corporate
purposes"
would
include
either
a
return
of
capital
or
a
dividend,
payment
out
to
shareholders.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
he
is
entitled
to
try
to
prove
that.
and
i'm
still
hung
up
on
your
assertion
that
he
made
no
proffer
on
it
below.
here's
another
portion
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
expert,
his
expert,
he
says,
will
further
explain
that
if
boulware
used...
this
is
on
page
97,
bottom
of
97:
"if
boulware
used
the
moneys
for
corporate
purposes,
the
moneys
were
not
income
to
boulware.
"
"alternatively,
the
expert
will
explain
that
if
the
moneys
were
not
loans
or
advances
or
if
boulware
did
not
use
the
moneys
for
corporate
purposes,
then
as
the
controlling
shareholder,
the
moneys
could
be
deemed
a
constructive
dividend
or
a
return
of
capital
to
boulware,
which
may
or
may
not
be
income
depending
on
whether
or
not
hie
had
earnings.
"
that
seems
to
me
presenting
the
claim
that
he
asserts
he
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
present.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
so,
no
harm
no
foul,
if,
in
fact,
you
hadn't
proffered
any
evidence
that
would
enable
you
to
meet
the...
in
respect
to
stock
requirement.
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
contention
that
you
hadn't
proffered
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
doesn't
he
have
to
show,
still
show,
that
it's
with
respect
to
stock?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
one
little
element:
that
he
has
to
show
the
distribution
was
not
because
this
was
his
girlfriend,
but
it
was
with
respect
to
stock,
and
the
record
is...
is
that
the
intent?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
wants
to
convict
more...
more
malfeasors
or
whether
it
wants
to
collect
more
money,
and
the
latter
obviously
prevails
in
the
cases,
right?
