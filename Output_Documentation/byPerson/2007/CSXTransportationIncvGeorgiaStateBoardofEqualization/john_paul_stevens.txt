justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
i
understood
you
to
be
arguing
that
the
district
court
made
an
error
of
law
in
not
receiving
evidence
of
a
different
methodology
offered
by
the
railroads.
and
also,
if
they
conceivably...
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
could
send
the
case
back,
they
could
then
receive
the
evidence
and
come
to
precisely
the
same
conclusion
that
they
already
came
to.
that
would
be
permissible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
your
position?
supposing
dickerson
had
adopted
the
stock-and-debt
method
and
taken
the
$12
million...
$12
billion
figure
and
said
that's
really
a
reasonable
basis,
and
then
he
ended
up
with
that
value.
would
you
be
able
to
defend
that
decision
with
precisely
the
same
arguments
that
you're
making
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
this
question
about
the
unit
rule...
i
take
it
georgia
is
figuring
out
what
the
entire
value
of
the
railroad
is
throughout
the
country.
have
other
states
had
to
make
the
same
determination
to
apply
their
unit
rules?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
say,
do
tennessee
and
mississippi
have
to
also
apply
the
unit
rule
to
value
the
property
of
this
particular
railroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
admissible
evidence
to
find
out
what
other...
figures
other
states
have
come
up
with?
because
you're
all
taking
the
same
answer,
aren't
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
all
use
the
unit
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
evidence
shows
that
49
states
have
come
up
with
a
valuation
of
$5
billion,
and
you
use
a
method
that
comes
up
with
$8
billion?
would
that
be
admissible
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
the
record
contain
any
such
evidence
in
this
case?
do
we
know
what
other
states
have
found.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
highest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
raise
some
suspicion
about
maybe
they
have
a
different
approach
than
is
commonly
applied
seeking
precisely
the
same
answer
to
precisely
the
same
question?
