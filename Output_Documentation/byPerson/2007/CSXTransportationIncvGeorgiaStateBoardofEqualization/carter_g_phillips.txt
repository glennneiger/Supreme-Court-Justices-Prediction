mr.
carter
g.
phillips
:
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
in
what
is
now
section
11501(b)(1)
crafted
what
this
court
described
as
a
straightforward
approach
to
determining
whether
a
state
is
unlawfully
taxing
railroad
property.
congress
used
a
precise
formula
that
is
set
out
in
a
pictorial
form
on
page
6
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
and
i
think
it's
probably
easier
to
kind
of
follow
along
on
that.
what
basically
congress
said
is
that
the
court
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
there's
an
illegal
tax
considers
the
assessed
value
of
rail
transportation
property
as
the
numerator
on
the
left
side
of
the
fraction,
compares
that
to
the
true
market
value
of
rail
transportation
property,
and
then
compares
that
ratio
to
the
ratio
created
by
examining
the
assessed
value
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
over
the
true
market
value.
fortunately,
in
this
particular
case
three
out
of
four
of
those
variables
are
agreed
to
by
the
parties,
so
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
constitutes
the
true
market
value
of
the
rail
transportation
property
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
this
court
in
burlington
northern
first
evaluated
the
language
of
this
statute
and
held,
in
what
i
think
the
court
later
would
describe
as
a
straightforward
fashion,
that
10501(b)(1)
declares
that
the
district
court...
for
the
district
court,
that
it
is
necessary
for
that
court
to
determine
what
the
true
market
values
of
the
respective
properties
are.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
congress
did
not
adopt
that
particular
formulation.
what
congress
tasked
the
district
court
with
doing
was
determining
the
true
market
value.
and
if
you
look
at
footnote
8
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
i
think
he
does
a
fairly
interesting
job
of
explaining
what
that
would
normally
mean.
he
says:
in
an
ordinary
valuation
case
i
would
take
in
all
of
the
expert
testimony
from
the
railroad,
i
would
take
in
all
of
the
expert
testimony
of
the
state,
i
would
evaluate
them
and
i
would
come
up
with
a
conclusion
as
to
what
i
think
is
the
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
i
think
every
facet
of
the
question
of,
that
goes
into
the
determination
of
what
is
a
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
think
all
it
says
is
that
in
this
particular
case
under
these
particular
circumstances
that
methodology
led
to
what
was
the
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
not
accurate.
i
think
what
will
happen
is
that
the
circumstances
change
every
day.
let's
just
take
a
pretty
simple
example.
let's
assume
that
in
year
1
the
district
court
decides
to
use
discounted
cash
flow.
in
year
2
it
turns
out
that
csx
or
some
other
railroad
property
is
sold,
so
that
you
have
an
actual
direct
sales
comparison
data
available
to
you
by
which
to
make
the
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
i'm
sure
that's
true
that
we'll
cite
it,
but
the
reality
is
that
the
district
court
in
the
second
case
is
not
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
case.
and
the
truth
is
every
single
one
of
these--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
district
court's
going
to
make
a
valuation.
it's
going
to
say
that
this
is
the
true
market
value.
that
determination
is
a
question
of
fact
and
therefore,
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
will
evaluate
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
fact
is
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
justice
alito,
that's
exactly
what
could
happen.
but
the
reality
is
is
that
that's
exactly
what's
been
going
on
since
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1976.
48
of
the
50
states
have
railroads
that
have
to
be
evaluated
and,
as
the
aar's
amicus
brief
points
out,
there
have
been
12
cases
on
this
particular
issue.
it
is
not
as
though
it
is
cost-free
for
the
railroads
to
challenge
what
the
states
are
doing
under
these
circumstances.
there
is
no
cost
shifting
or
fee
shifting
arrangement.
and
second,
you're
suing
the
very
person
who's
going
to
be
making
the
decision
next
year
as
to
the
value
of
your
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
well,
blissfully,
more
often
than
not
it
turns
out
that
the
overvaluation
are
not
nearly
that
stark.
but
i
think
that
goes
to
the
core
point
here,
which
is
that
if
this
court
concludes
like
the
eleventh
circuit
did,
which
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
challenging
the
methodology,
then
it
would
have
been
completely
within
the
province
of
the
state
of
georgia
to
say,
we're
going
to
adopt
a
stock
and
debt
method,
which
virtually
everybody
recognizes
is
not
an
accurate
way
to
determine
true
market
value,
that
that
number
would
have
been
$12.2
billion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
there's
ever
a
reason
why
the
federal
court
has
to
adopt
a
single
methodology
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
i
think
what
congress
intended
is
what
happens
in
every
run
of
the
mine
valuation
case
that
comes
up
in
either
state
or
federal
court,
which
is
that
each
side
presents
its
best
guess
as
to
what
the
true
market
value
is
and
the
district
court
resolves
those
differences
and
comes
out
with
a
number
that
the
district
court
believes
constitutes
the
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
scalia,
there
are.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
you
read
footnote
8
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
district
judge
says,
if
this
were
a
typical
valuation
case
what
i
would
have
done
is
i
would
have
listened
to
the
railroad,
i
would
have
listened
to
the
state
and
i
would
have
made
a
judgment
as
to
what
i
think
is
the
right--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
that's
because
there's
usually...
which
rates
affect
the
taking
of
property?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
or
what
the
rates
ought
to
be?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
that's
because
that's
regulated
by
a
federal
agency
that
formulates
a
very
precise
approach
typically.
but
there's
nothing
like
that...
and
that
approach
governs
every
utility
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
ferc.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
permitted
for
them
to
use
different
methodologies
because
typically
they
do.
the
reality
is
they
almost
never
use
the
same
methodology
for
determining
railroad
property
as
they
do
for
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
because
the
data
that
are
available
for
the
two
are
never
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
would
make
that
argument,
but
you'd
also
make
an
argument
as
to
sort
of
what
data
are
available
in
any
particular
case
to
allow
a
particular
methodology
to
be
used.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
test
here
is
purely
a
results-driven
test.
it
doesn't
tell
the
state
what
methodologies
to
use
on
either
side
of
the
equation.
what
it
says
is
at
the
end
of
the
process
you
end
up
with
a
ratio
between
assessed
and
true
market
value
for
each
that's
within
5
percent.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
state
can
use
any...
the
state
can
assess
any
way
it
wants
to
in
defense
of
its
ultimate
outcome.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
the
outcome
it
has
to
have
the
right
ratio.
that's
clearly
what
congress
intended.
i
mean,
this
language
could
not
be
more
straightforward.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
my
guess
is
that
the
district
judge
in
that
situation
would
probably
say
that
that
is
the
true
market
value.
the
problem
is
when
you
deviate
from
that
methodology
when
you're
evaluating
commercial
and
industrial
property
what
happens
in
that
context?
does
that
end
up
with
a
true
market
value
that's
much
higher
or
lower.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
well,
at
the
end
of
the
day
that's
right.
the
question
here
is
the
comparison
of
assessed
to
true
market
value
on
both
sides
of
the
equation.
it
doesn't
dictate
the
methodology
for
get
ting
there
in
either
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
believe
that
is,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
more
often
than
not,
my
answer
would
be
no,
there
wouldn't
be
any
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
protection
that
we're
seeking,
justice,
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
is
to
have
the
independent
de
novo
assessment
by
the
district
court.
i
mean,
that's
the
real
purpose
of
the
statute,
is
to
provide
a
federal
forum.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
depends
on
what
you're
asking
me.
are
you
talking
about
how
the
district
court,
or
the
court
of
appeals?
if
it's
in
the
district
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
the
question
for
the
district
court
is
not
with
deference
to
how
the
state
is
evaluating
this
issue.
the
question
is
for
the
district
court,
de
novo,
to
make
a
determination
of
what
the
true
market
value
is.
but
asking
on
the
court
of
appeals
side,
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
i
understand
the
way
this
statute
applies,
this
is
not
a
statute
that
worries
about
sort
of
how
you
get
to
the
numbers.
all
this
statute
worries
about
is
when
you
get
to
a
number
at
the
end
of
the
day,
is
it
within
5
percent
of
the
same
number
that
you...
the
same
ratio
you
would
have
gotten
using
whatever
methodology
you
use
on
a
commercial
and
industrial
side.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
it's
more
than
5
percent,
then
we
are
entitled
to
injunctive
relief;
and
if
it's
not,
then
we
are
not
entitled
to
injunctive
relief.
and
that's
why
i
think
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
think
about
this
in
the
context
of...
because
you
know,
there's
deference
to
the
way
the
state
analyzes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
in
some
ways
it's
difficult
to
know.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
they
should
be
applying
the
professional
standards
of
appraisal.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
trust
me,
having
read
them,
you
can't
grab
them
out
of
thin
air.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
be
sure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
justice
souter,
that's
driven
largely
by
what
data
are
available
and
what
do
we
know
about
how
these
methods
have
been
applied
in
the
past
to
value
this
particular
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
also
an
element
of
judgment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
a
different
world,
that
would
make
perfect
sense.
that's
an
approach
congress
clearly
could
have
embraced.
the
problem
is
congress
didn't
do
that.
congress
said
choose
the
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
set
this
up
as
a
review
process
of
what
the
state
does.
congress
intended
for
the
district
court
to
do
what
this
court
said
in
burlington
northern,
make
the
necessary
determination
of
the
true
market
value
of
that
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
the
court
said
is
that...
or
what
congress
has
said
is
that
the
district
court
can
take
all
of
that
into
account;
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
is
the
district
court
serving
as
a
check
on
what
the
state
does
that
decides
what
the
true
market
value.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
try
to
be
brief.
first
of
all,
justice
stevens,
in
response
to
your
question
on
the
comparisons
between
georgia
and
other
states,
on
page
22
of
our
cert
petition
we
pointed
out
that
in
the
2006
tax
year
georgia
and
florida
had
adopted
unit
values
of
$11.2
billion
and
$12.9
billion;
whereas,
every
other
state
in
those
jurisdictions
that
used
the
unit
value
had
an
assessment
value
of
$7.1
billion.
and
the
respondent
state
did
not
question
that.
so
i
mean
the
reality
is
there
are
wide
swings,
and
it
does
make
a
difference
what
methodology
you
do,
and
it's
part
of
the
reason
why
it's
absolutely
critical
that
the
court
should
enforce
the
language
of
the
statute.
as
justice
scalia
quite
properly
recognizes,
it
is
the
true
market
value.
and
this
is
not
a
statute
like,
for
instance,
28
u.s.c.
1254(d)(1)
in
aedpa,
which
says
the
federal
courts
should
defer
to
any
reasonable
determination
by
the
state
courts
in
a
judgment
federal
law.
this
is
a
statute
that
vests
the
district
court
with
the
exclusive
authority
to
make
the
determination
of
the
true
market
value.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
and
that's...
and
that's
exactly
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
isn't
any
single
method
that's
out
there.
all
we
have
are
a
series
of
evidences
of
value,
and
the
district
court
needs
to
be
able
to
evaluate
them
without
regard
to
some
kind
of
thumb
on
the
scale
of
the
state,
in
favor
of
the
state.
and
as
you
asked
the
question,
you
know,
is
there
any
other
valuation
process
that
would
work
this
way,
the
answer
was
no.
and
the
problem
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
this,
in
this
statute
that
remotely
suggests
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
do
anything
other
than
the
ordinary
or
typical
valuation
in
this
context.
justice
souter,
i
think
you
made
the
point,
which
is
the
one
i
wanted
to
make
in
my
opening
statement,
which
is
how
is
it
possible
that
congress
recognizes
decades
of
discrimination
involving
tens
or
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
would
have
said
and
now
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
trying
to
correct
that
discrimination,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
defer
to
the
entity
that's
been
discriminating
for
all
of
those
years.
it
is
at
least
passing
strange,
if
not
incredible
to
think
that
that's
what
congress
meant.
it
is
much
more
sensible
to
think
that
congress
wanted
the
district
court
to
serve
as
a
serious
check
on
what
the
state
did.
that's
what
we
didn't
get
in
this
case.
that's
what
we
are
entitled
to.
i
urge
the
court
to
vacate
and
to
revamp.
thank
you,
your
honor.
