justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask
this
question.
is
it...
would
it
be
permitted
for
a
state
to
say
that,
with
respect
to
utilities
and
certain
industries,
including
railroads,
we
use
valuation
method
a,
with
respect
to
commercial
rental
real
estate
property
we
use
valuation
method
b?
is
that
permitted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
a
large
part
of
the
argument
you
would
make
that
other
utilities
are
comparable
or
not
comparable
to
a
railroad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
an
accounting
journal
or
some
prestigious
group
of
accountants
and
tax
appraisers
came
up
with
a
new
theory
for
evaluating
railroad
property
and
it
was
conceded
by
all
to
be
highly
accurate.
could
they
use
just
that
for
the
railroad
and
different
methodologies
for
all
other
utilities
all
over
the
country?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
had
the
platonic,
the
ideal
valuation
method,
the
state
could
use
it
only
if
it
ended
up
with
the
right
ratio?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
end
it
has
to
have
the
right
ratio.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
congress
uses
the
word
"true
market
value"
and
under
this
hypothetical
i
come
very
close
to
true
market
value,
and
you
say
it
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
your...
i
thought
your
submission
was
that
even
if
is
true
market
value
for
the
railroad,
the
ratio
still
has
to
be
in
line
if
the
methodology
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
would
your
position
be
any
stronger
if
it
used
fair
market
value?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
any
weaker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
mean,
we
have
false
"fair
market
value"?
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing.
