justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
they
do
that
is
because
none
of
these
methods
comes
even
close
to
working
out
what
the
company
is
really
worth
because,
if
we
had,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we'd
be
out
in
wall
street.
we'd
make
billions.
[laughter]
all
right.
so
they
don't
know,
and
they
use
all
these
different
methods
sort
of
as
checks
one
on
the
other.
now,
the
railroad
simply
wants
to
say:
look,
you
had
an
expert
here
and
he
went
and
used
a
method,
and
it
comes
up
with
a
certain
number,
but
if
you
look
at
a
few
other
methods,
you'll
see
that's
an
outlier.
okay?
now,
why
shouldn't
it
be
able
to
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
not
going
to
do
that.
the
state
has
enormous
leeway.
anyone
who
valued
a
railroad
running
through
the
center
of
this
city,
of
what
it
would
be
worth
if
the
property
were
sold
on
the
private
market,
you'd
get
an
astronomical
number.
so
the
chances
of
this
number
being
higher
than
the
sales
value
of
private
property
is
not
great.
so,
if
you've
come
in
with
some
method
that
puts
it
higher
than
that,
well,
why
shouldn't
they
be
able
to
come
in
and
say:
look,
look
what
they've
got
with
this
method,
which
in
our
opinion
is
not
a
fair
method.
now,
why
not?
because
after
all,
if
you're
going
to
say
they
can't,
then
there
is
no
check
on
the
state
working
out
a
method
that
discriminates,
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
seriously
against
the
railroads.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they're
going
to
do
is
they're
simply
going
to
let
people
present
the
evidence
as
you've
heard,
which
will
have
15
valuation
methods
if
they
want,
all
serving
each
as
checks
on
the
other.
there's
no
single
method.
so
why
would
you
end
up
with
that
result?
