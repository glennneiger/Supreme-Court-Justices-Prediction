justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
realistic
to
think
that
you
can
calculate
with
any
degree
of
precision
what
the
true
market
value
of
csx's
property
is?
the
range
of
values
that
were
calculated
by
both
of
these
experts
are
really
astonishing,
from
12.3
billion
to
8.1
billion
for
dickerson,
from
9.3
to
5.9
for
tegarden.
it's
like
$3
billion
or
$4
billion
doesn't
mean
anything.
what
is
the...
can
this
be
done
with
any
precision
or
is
it
more
realistic
just
to
say
that
what
the
district
court
would
have
to
do
is
to
figure
out
whether
the
state's
calculation
is
within
some
reasonable
range?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you
said
that
csx
has
properties
in
15
states
that
use
the
unit
method
of
calculation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
you
challenge
all
of
those
there
could
be
15
different
district
court
findings
on
true
market
value,
and
so
within
each
circuit
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
decide
which
district
court
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
would
you
disagree
if
had
you
10
totally
disinterested
experts,
not
paid
by
either
side,
and
they
engaged
in
this,
that
they
would
not
all
come
to
the
same
number,
that
there
would
be
a
range
and
probably
a
fairly
significant
range?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
it
had
been...
i'm
sorry...
if
it
had
been
dickerson's
methodology
at
the
last
step
to
choose
the
highest
value,
would
that
be
reasonable?
