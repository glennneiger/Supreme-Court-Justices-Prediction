justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
approach
the
same
issue
this
way?
when
a
state
board
in
this
case
determines
what
method
of
valuation
it
is
going
to
use,
what
does
it
consider?
what
are
the
reasons
that
it
chooses
method
a
rather
than
method
b?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
should
the
reasons
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
professional
standards,
i
take
it,
are
not
simply
rules
that
one
can
grab
out
of
thin
air
depending
on
one's
mood.
doesn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--doesn't
one
have
to
choose
the
methodology
based
on
some
factual
determination
on...
which
would
support
a
conclusion
that
this
is
a
better
methodology
for
this
case
and
others--
justice
david
h.
souter
--for
this
case
than
others?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
a
determination
which
is
based
upon
facts.
there
are
good
reasons
in
fact
to
choose
method
a
rather
than
method
b,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
it
make
sense
then
for
a
reviewing
court
to
review
the
basis
upon
which
the
methodology
was
chosen,
and
if
in
fact
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
choosing
methodology
a
rather
than
methodology
b,
accept
it
and
defer
it
to
that
extent?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
talking
about
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
state
authority
in
choosing
one
method
rather
than
another.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't...
we
don't
know,
there
is
no
way
of
telling
whether
there
is
a
variation,
or
there
isn't
a
variation
under
the
congressional
formula,
unless
we
first
have
a
formula
for
determining
what
the
value...
what
the
true
value
of
the
railroad
property
is.
we
know
that
can
vary.
that
can
vary
depending
upon
the
methodology
chosen.
the
methodology
chosen
is
dependent
upon
good
facts,
to
pick
one
or
the
other;
and
therefore,
doesn't
the
very...
the
very
criterion
that
congress
chose
ultimately
depend
upon
the
methodology?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
you
take
my
variation
on
it,
and
that
is,
we
don't
defer
it
to
the
state's
choice
in
the
abstract,
i.e.
if
we...
if
there
are
10
methods,
as
long
as
it's
one
of
the
10
it's
okay?
rather,
if
we
defer
at
all,
we
defer
it
to
the
choice
that
is
made
to...
to
accept
one
or
the
other
methodology,
and
we
look
to
the
reasons
that
the
state
gives
for
making
that
choice?
would
that
take
all
the
teeth
out
of
the
federal
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
point
is
well
taken.
it
has
a
variety,
and
then
it
makes
some
kind
of
a
judgmental
choice
as
between
the
results
it
gets.
but
that
i
guess
just
makes
my
question
more
complicated.
as
long
as
it...
as
long
as
it
has
good
reasons
for
selecting,
let's
say
the
three
competing
methodologies
that
it
uses,
and
as
long
as
it
has
a
rational...
gives
a
rational
basis
for
the
ultimate
resolution,
should
we
not
or
should
a
court
not
defer
to
the
choices?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
judgment
get
exercised
in
determining
what
facts
are
good
reasons
for
selecting
this
methodology,
or
this
variant
of
methodology,
for
this
particular
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
point
not
that
anyone
is
denying
that
there
can
be
a
range,
that
there...
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
not
here,
simply
because
there
is
not
one
methodology,
there
is
not
an
exact
science
which
is
operating?
but
isn't
the
real
point
the
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
that
when
congress
uses
the
term
"true
market
value",
when
it
has
a
criterion
of
truth,
the
one
thing
that
does
seem
to
be
clear
is
that,
if
you
are
looking
for
truth,
you
do
not
defer
to
a
party
in
interest?
and
isn't
that
the
one
point?
and
if
you
accept
that
point,
then
doesn't
it
follow
that
methodology
is
up
to
the
assessment
of
the
district
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
it
say
it
more
plainly
than
using
the
criterion
of
truth?
justice
david
h.
souter
truth...
whatever
truth
means,
it
doesn't
mean
deferring
to
a
party
in
interest.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
all
accept
that.
the
question
is
not
whether
we're
talking
about
rocket
science
in
valuation.
the
question
is
whether
we
are
deferring
to
a
choice
made
by
the
party
in
interest?
and
doesn't
the
criterion
of
truth
imply
that
we
do
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
congress
in
effect
was
engaging
in
pontius
pilate's
exercise,
what
is
truth?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the...
that
the
court
is
simply
being
turned
into
a
grade
school
math
teacher
who
looks
to
see
whether
the
sums
are
added
up
correctly.
that
can't
be
what
congress
had
in
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
there
was...
there
was
a
contest
about
the
judgment
used
by
the
state
in
selecting
one
point
of
datum
in
its
calculation,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
that
kind
of
judgment...
if
it
makes
sense
under
the
statute
to
put
that
kind
of
judgment
in
question,
why
doesn't
it
equally
make
sense
under
the
statute
to
put
other
questions
of
judgment
such
as
the
selection
of
the
methodology
to
which
the
data
point
in
fact
is
relevant?
where
do
you
stop?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
that's
why
you
think.
my
question
is,
if
you
agree
that
it's
appropriate
under
the
congressional
statute
to
challenge
one
issue
of
judgment,
why
isn't
it
equally
appropriate
to
challenge
other
issues
of
judgment,
i.e.,
selection
of
methodology?
justice
david
h.
souter
each
one,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
question
of
judgment
about
what
is
appropriate
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
or
these
kinds
of
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if...
i
take
it
to
determine
how
far
you
could
go
with
that,
i
take
it
though
in
your
view
if
the
state's
appraiser
had
never
done
an
appraisal
before
in
his
life,
if
he
were
plucked
off
the
street
by
the
state
and
said,
you
know,
"appraise
the
railroad
property;
we
are
making
you
a
state
appraiser.
"
on
your
view
the
district
court
could
not
look
behind
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
exactly.
but
the
selection
of
the
methodology
by
the
guy
off
the
street
could
not
be
examined.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
it's
one
of
the
recognized
methodologies.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
happens
to
be
the
one
that
gives
the
highest
number.
but
it's
a
recognized
methodology
and
there
are
certain...
certainly
examples
in
which
that
methodology
has
been
used,
and
i
take
it
that
if
the
guy
off
the
street
picks
one
of
those,
and
that's
all
we
know
about
it,
the
district
court
on
your
view
cannot
look
behind
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
you
say
it
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
could
you
say
it
consistently
with
your
position
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
the
court
have
an
opportunity
or
the
right
to
examine
whether
any
particular
methodology
is
reasonable
as
applied
to
this
taxpayer
and
this
kind
of
property
at
this
time?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought...
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
reproduction
method
had
such
severe
problems
associated
with
it
that
it
simply
would
not
be
a
fair
methodology
to
use
and
at
least
a
reviewing
court,
a
district
court
could...
could
draw
that
conclusion.
i
thought
that
was
your
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
are
talking
about
the
railroads
like
csx,
and
i
thought
your
answer
was
that
a...
a
district
court
could
conclude
that
as
applied
in
a
case
like
this,
that
there
are
so
many
problems
that
it
simply
would
not
be
a
reasonable
valuation
method.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
well
then
how
do
you
draw
a
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
can
do
that,
why
can't
it
do
what...
what
your
brother
is
saying
it
should
do
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
i'm
making
that
argument
now
in
my
question.
why...
why
can
you
draw
the
line
that
you
want
to
draw?
