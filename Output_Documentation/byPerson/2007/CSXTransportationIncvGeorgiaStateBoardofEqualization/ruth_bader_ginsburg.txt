there's
something
not
quite
right
about
that.
wasn't
all
the
evidence
submitted,
but
the
district
judge
said,
i
have
all
the
evidence,
but
i
can't
consider.
it
isn't
a
question
of
introducing
new
evidence
when
it
goes
back.
it's
a
question
of
looking
at
the
body
of
evidence
that
was
submitted.
justice
ruth
bader

could
the
district
court
appoint
a
special
master
to
help
her?
justice

and
if
you
limit
it
to
the
application
and
not
the
methodology,
then
congress's
overriding
goal
was
there
was
a
problem
with
overevaluation
of
the
railroad's
property,
and
congress
was
responding
to
that
problem
of
overevaluating
the
property.
but
if
you
limit
the
challenger
to
just
the
application,
then
you
are
not
going
to
have
as
vigorous
a
check
on
over
evaluation
as
you
would
have
if
you
could...
if
you
could
reach
back
to
the
methodology.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought...
i
thought
you
conceded
that
that
was
what
it
would
be,
because
you
said
that
the
federal
court
would
be
turned
into
a
board
of
equalization,
and
a
board
of
equalization
is
not
making
grand
law
for
setting
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
what
they
want
is
to
be
able
to
attack
the
methodology
and
not
be
limited
to
the
application
of
whatever
methodology
the
state
prefers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
both
sides
agreed
that
the
unit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
guess
the
term
methodology
is
confusing
because
you
could
think
it
means
unit
rule--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--or
you
could
think
how
under
the
unit
rule,
what
is
