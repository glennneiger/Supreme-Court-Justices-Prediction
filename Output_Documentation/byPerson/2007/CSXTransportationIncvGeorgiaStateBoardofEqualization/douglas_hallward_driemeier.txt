mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
did
not,
in
the
4-r
act,
establish
a
right
to
obtain
in
federal
court
administrative
review
of
state
valuations.
rather,
it
established
a
federal
right
against
state
discrimination
in
which
the
railroad
could
bring
a
de
novo
suit
in
federal
court
to
vindicate
that
right.
justice
alito
pointed
out
the
wide
range
of
value
that
could
be
generated
by
generally
accepted
methodologies...
6
billion
to
12.4
billion,
in
this
case.
clearly,
if
one
were
to
accept
the
state's
rule
that
any
reasonable
methodology,
by
which
they
mean
any
methodology
that
is
reasonable
in
the
abstract
that
may
have
been
approved
by
this
court
in
the
1800's,
a
state
could
hide
any
variety
of
discriminations
within
that
rubric.
there
would
be
very
little,
if
any
meat
to
federal
court
review
under
the
4-r
act.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
that
it
would,
to
a
large
extent,
undermine
the
right
and
protection
that
congress
intended.
and
partly,
i
think
that
the...
your
honor's
question
is
based
on
a
faulty
premise,
and
that
is
that
the
state
uses
a
single
methodology
in
carrying
out
its
valuation.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i
think
that
to
call
the
weighing
of
the
three
evidences
of
value
that
might
be
generated
by
cost
income,
sales
methods,
a
choice
of
methodology
to
which
the
federal
court
is
required
to
defer
is
a
misnomer,
because
it
really
is
an
exercise
of
judgment
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
reliability
of
the
data
available.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
that
the...
because
you're
pointing
out
that
really,
the
choice
among
methodologies
is
more
a
question
of
what
are
the
facts
on
the
ground,
what
is
the
reliable,
available
data
that
could
be
used
in
generating
these
different
evidences
of
value.
and
the
court's
role,
in
our
view,
is
to
consider
all
of
the
evidences
of
value,
not
just
the
state's
evidence.
that
would
be
the
proper
approach
in
a
suit
for
administrative
review...
of
administrative
determination
by
the
state,
but
is
a
de
novo
proceeding
in
which
the
court
is
to
consider
all
evidence
of
value
to
determine,
to
its
own
satisfaction,
what
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
is.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
do
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
review
is
reviewing
a
determination
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
there
may
be
subsidiary
questions
of
the
law
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
review.
for
example--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
do
believe...
yes,
that
the
review
of
the
appellate
court
of
the
district
court's
finding
is
different
than
the
review
of
the
district
court's
review
of--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
again,
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
district
court
would
have
used
a
single
methodology.
rather--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
i--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
it
would
be,
as
justice
souter
suggested,
a
question
of
whether
those
methodologies...
whether
the
evidence
in
the
case
indicated
that
those
methodologies
were
reliable
indications
of
value.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
would
have
to
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
have
relied
on
them--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--i
do
believe
that's
true,
and
that
is
in
the
nature
of
the
appellate
court's
review
of
the
factual
finding
by
the
district
court.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
it
would
be
permissible.
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
stephens.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
that's
right.
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
it
was
excluded,
in
the
sense
that
tegarden
wasn't
allowed
to
testify.
it
was
excluded
by
the
court
in
its
consideration.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
i...
whether
they
are
in
the
ballpark
is
not
the
test.
whether
they
are
indications...
reliable
indications
of
true
market
value.
true
market
value
is
a
fact
that,
as
the
court
recognized
in
burlington
northern,
must
be
determined
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
well,
they
were...
respondent
argues
that
they
were
all
reasonable
methodologies.
but
no,
i
don't
think
that
it's
true
that
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
is
either
6
billion
or
12
billion.
the
determination
the
federal
court
has
to
decide
is
what
is
the
true
market
value.
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
i
don't
think
that
that--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
there
are
bases
upon
which
one
can
distinguish
the
reliability
of
the
stock
and
debt
method
in
this
case,
and
the
income
that
the
two
parties
used--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--there
would
be
a
range.
i
don't
know
that
it
would
be
a
range
from
6
to
12
billion.
but...
i
think--
mr.
douglas
hallward-driemeier
--well,
the
district...
as
in
the
tyler
regional
planning
case,
the
court
indicated
that
district
courts
frequently
have
to
undertake
complicated
valuation
questions,
and
they
rely
on
the
testimony
of
experts.
appointment
of
a
master
might
well
be
permissible.
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
textual
indications,
that
this
is
a
question
for
the
federal
court.
there
is
no
question
that
the
statute
refers
to
the
burden
of
proof
in
determining
true
market
value.
in
burlington
northern,
the
court
recognized
that
the
allocation
of
burden
of
proof
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
fact
to
be
proved
to
the
court.
in
fact,
in
se,
with
respect
to
true
market
value
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
properties,
it
specifically
says
that
it
is
to
be
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court.
now
in
burlington
northern,
the
court
remarked
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
construe
the
statute
to
lead
to
strikingly
different
approaches,
whether
the
railroad's
challenge
was
based
on
the
alleged
undervaluation
of
other
properties
or
overvaluation
of
the
railroad
property.
now,
we
know
from
the
statute
that
the
court
is
not
to
defer
to
any
methodology,
or
amalgam
of
methodologies,
the
state
uses
in
valuing
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
rather,
the
court
is
to
look
to
the
best
evidence
of
value,
which
is
sales
data.
now,
if
the
court
has
sales
data
available
to
it
in
the
case
regarding
the
value
of
the
railroad,
certainly
the
court
should
rely
on
that
reliable
information,
rather
than
the
state's
chosen
methodology.
thank
you
very
much.
