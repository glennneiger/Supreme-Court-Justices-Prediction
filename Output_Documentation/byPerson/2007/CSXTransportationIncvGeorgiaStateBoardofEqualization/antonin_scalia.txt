justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
valuation
cases
under
the
takings
clause,
aren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
a
standard
federal
rule
for
how
you
evaluate--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
phillips,
could
i
come
back
to
this
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
a
uniform
federal
rule
or
not.
when
the
district
court
makes
this
finding
of
what
the
true
market
value
is
that's
a
finding
of
fact,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
would
be
reviewed
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
there
were
various
methodologies
that
were
possible
and
this
was
one
of
the
ones
that
was
ballpark
at
least
reasonable,
would
the
court
of
appeals
have
any
basis
for
reversing
the,
how
could
you
say
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
what
his
question
is.
i
think
he
is
talking
about
reviewing
the
district
court's
judgment
on
that
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
don't
agree
with
justice
souter's
test
for
the
district
court
review
of
the
state,
might
you
agree
with
it
as
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
review
of
the
district
court's
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question,
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
was
different.
i
asked
whether
a
reasonable
basis
for
plain
error...
for
clearly
erroneous
review,
by
the
court
of
appeals,
begins
with
assessing
whether
the
methodology
used
by
the
district
court
is
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
combination
of
methodologies.
i'm
talking
about...
when
i
say
methodology,
i
mean
even
if
it
uses
a
combination
of
five
different
ones,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
reasonable?
how
do
you
propose
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
review
the
district
court's
selection
of
methodologies?
justice
antonin
scalia
--were
reasonable?
do
they
have
to
have
been
the
very
best?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clearly
erroneous
if
it
may
not
be
the
very
best,
but
it's
ballpark
and
there
is
disagreement
as
to
what
the
very
best
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
be
what
it
says
though,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
language?
what's
the
crucial
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
require...
what
it
say
the
district
court
is
supposed
to
find?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
supposed
to
find
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroads.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
fuzzy
language.
district
court
is
to
find
true
market
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
strange
way
of
saying
the
district
judge
is
to...
is
to
ask
whether
the
state
has
used
one
of
a
number
of
reasonable
methods
of
determining
the
market
value.
to
say,
go
find
the
true
market
value
is
a
very
strange
way
of
saying
that,
and
that's
what
you,
that's
what
you're
saying
it
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
expecting
you
to
say,
that
what
is
truth?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
is
you
can't
find
a...
it
is
a
line,
but
it's
not
a
line
you
can
derive
from
true
market
value.
i
mean,
you
can
do
it,
but
what
in
the
statute
suggests
that
that's
what
you
should
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
they're
not
going
to
get
that
from
this
court,
any
more
than
they
could
get
it
from
the
court
of
appeals.
all
the
court
of
appeals
can
say,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
methodology
that
the
district
court
used
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
i
think
another
district
court
in
a
later
year
could
probably
use
a
different
methodology,
which
would
again
be
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
we're
not...
i
don't
think
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
is
placing
any
stamp
on
a
particular
methodology.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
did,
but
they're
not
going
to
get
it
here--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
state
appraiser
as
i
understand
it
had
never
done
an
appraisal
before
of...
of
this
magnitude,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
looking
for
the
footnote,
but
i...
i
was,
i
was
impressed
by
what
seemed
to
me
the...
the
vast
difference
in...
in
qualifications
and
experience
of
the...
of
the
state
appraiser
and
of
the
expert
who
was
brought
in
by
the
railroads
at
the
trial.
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
absurd
to
say
we
have
to
defer
to...
to
this
novice
in
the
field,
and...
and
not
look
at
the...
at
the
testimony
of...
of
someone
who
has
done
a
lot
of
it
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
have
a
response...
did
you
have
a
response
to
that
footnote?
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
skipped
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
little
footnote
battle
here,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
yours?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
you
have
here.
i've
looked...
i've
looked
at
your
footnote
and
i
see
that
indeed
mr.
dickerson
did
have
over
30
years
experience
including
well
over
a
thousand
valuations...
performed
under
the
unit
rule;
performed
under
one
method
of
evaluation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
whole
issue
here
is
that
that
method
of
valuation,
however
expert
he
is
at
it,
is
not
proper
here.
it
doesn't
work.
that
there
are
other
ones
that
should
have
been
brought
to
bear.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
one
of
the
ones,
yes;
but
that's
not
the
only
one.
that's
the
only
one
he
is
an
expert
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
different
methodologies
under
the
unit
rule.
he
has
used...
he
has
used
different
methodologies
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
calvert,
can
you
tell
me
how
this
thing
works,
or
how
it
may
work
in
the
future?
does
the
state
just
whip
up
a
number
and
lay
it
on
the
railroad,
or...
or,
in
fact,
is
there
some
discussion
each
year
between
the
railroad's
experts
and
the...
and
the
state's
experts
as
to
what
the
right
number
should
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
there
is
some
give-and-take
discussion
before
the
state
comes
down
firmly
and
says:
cough
up
the
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
