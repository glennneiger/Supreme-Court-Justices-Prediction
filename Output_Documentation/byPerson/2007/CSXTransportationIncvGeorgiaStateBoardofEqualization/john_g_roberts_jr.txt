chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1287,
csx
transportation
v.
the
georgia
state
board
of
equalization.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
do
you
want
the
district
court
to
in
addition
determine
which
methodology
most
accurately
reflects
that
true
market
value?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
want
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
state's
chosen
methodology
for
determining
market
value?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the,
so
if
the
district
court
says
this
methodology,
methodology
a,
most
accurately
yields
true
market
value,
that
is
giving
rise
to
a
federal
rule
of
determining
value,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
see
how
it
varies
based
on
the
particular
circumstances.
if
he
says
i
think,
you
know,
whatever
it
is,
discounted
value
approach
is
the
best
way
for
determining
market
value,
he's
not
going
to
in
the
next
case
or
the
district
court
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
say,
i
think
reproduction
cost
is
the
best
method.
you're
going
to
establish
a
federal
rule
for
what
is
the
best
way
of
determining
market
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
happens,
that
happens
once
every
25
years.
if
you
prevail
on
a
method
that
you
think
is
more
favorable
to
railroads
before
a
particular
district
court,
you're
going
to
cite
that
district
court
in
the
next
case
that
you've
got
and
you
say:
look
a
district
court's
already
looked
at
this
and
they
said
method
a
is
a
better
way
of
determining
market
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
a
district
court
says
in
one
case
method
a
is
the
best
way
to
get
market
value
and
another
district
court
says
method
b
and
they
both
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
have
to
resolve
that
conflict,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
already
been
pointed
out
if
the
range
is
a
variable
of
$4
billion
i
think
it
probably
is
worth
their
while
to
challenge
what
they
think
is
a
low
valuation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
we
were
to
adopt
a
different
approach
which
said
that
you
can
challenge
the
methodology,
methodology,
when
different
methodologies
are
used,
but
if
the
state
is
using
the
same
methodology
that's
their
choice?
it
seems
to
me
the
only
other
alternative
is
to
have
the
federal
judiciary
develop
a
federal
rule
about
what
methodology
has
to
be
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
that
how
it
works
in
utility
rate
regulation?
isn't
there
in
fact
a
standard
federal
method
of
determining
what
rates
affect
the
taking
of
property--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
if
it's
challenged--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
rate
of
return
in
a
public
utility.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
more
often
than
not.
but
in
fact
it
is
an
ultimate
finding
of
fact,
but
it's
based
on
valuation
methodology
and
that's
what's
at
issue
here.
no
one
doubts
that
the
application
of
a
methodology
can
be
challenged.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
if
you
start
out...
i
reached
these
facts
because
i
used
reproduction
costs
as
my
method
of
valuation,
and
your
submission
is
going
to
be
that
vastly
overvalues
our
property
and
you
should
use
a
different
method.
that's
a
legal
question.
that's
not
a
method...
question
of
fact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
district
court...
what
if
there
is
one
methodology
that
gets
you
an
answer
within
20
percent
margin
of
error,
up
or
down,
and
there
is
another
methodology
that
gives
you
an
answer
with
a
5
percent
margin
of
error,
up
or
down?
can
you
challenge
the
application
of
one
of
those
as
opposed
to
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
of
course
you
can
challenge
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
question...
my
question
assumes
that
the
methodology
leads
to
a
value
that
is
either
20
percent
higher
or
lower
in
one
case,
and
5
percent
higher
or
lower
in
the
other
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
all
of
the
values
that
were
arrived
at
in
this
case
within
the
ballpark?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
all
the
valuations
used
here
reliable
indications
of
true
market
value?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
way
to
tell.
everybody
agrees
we're
just
making
more
or
less
educated
guesses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
the
district
court
has
to
engage
in
purely
fictional
enterprise,
and
say
yes,
all
the
methodologies
give
you
a
range
of
6
to
12
billion,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
8.2
billion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hallward-driemeier.
mr.
calvert.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
what...
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that
would
be
part
of
your
reply
to
justice
breyer,
that
you
had
five
different
methodologies
here
and
you
chose
the
lowest
one;
and
the
question
really
is
how
many
more
methodologies
do
you
have
to
look
at
if
you're
going
to
choose
the
lowest
one
in
each
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
know,
if
this
comes
down
as
it
probably
will
in
every
case,
to
a
battle
of
competing
experts,
are
you
aware
of
any
other
area
where
we
say
that
a
district
court
cannot
look
at
the
methodology
used
by
an
expert
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
give
credence
to
the
expert's
opinion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
why
should
we
create
a
special
rule
here
for
the
state?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
what
if
the
state
elected
to
use
reproduction
cost
as
its
valuation
method,
which
i
guess
everybody
agrees
vastly
overstates
the
value
of
the
railroad?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
there
are
problems
with
a
particular
methodology,
the
methodology
can
be
challenged?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
your
argument
is
that
it's
not
reasonable
because
it
must
overstate
the
value
by
a
particular
percentage
or
number.
and
i
think
justice
souter's
question
is:
well,
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
if
you
say
it's
not
reasonable
because
it
overstates
value
by
50
percent,
is
a
methodology
that
overstates
value
by
20
percent
reasonable
or
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--keeping
in
mind
all
the
methodologies
here
range
from
8...
6
billion
to
12
billion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
calvert.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
i
assume
that's
in
the
normal
context
of
the
adversary
process.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
does
not
necessarily
have
to
come
up
with
a
number
independent
of
what
the
parties
present
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
can
decide
which
of
the
presentations
is
closer
to
true
market
value.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
phillips,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
06-1287,
csx
transportation
versus
georgia
state
board
of
equalization.
in
1976,
congress
passed
an
act
to
prevent
states
from
discriminating
against
railroads
by
taxing
railroad
property
more
heavily
than
other
commercial
property
in
the
state.
in
a
prior
case,
we
held
that
this
statute,
popularly
known
as
the
4-r
act,
permits
a
railroad
to
challenge
a
state's
valuation
of
its
property
for
tax
purposes.
states
can
discriminate
by
applying
higher
tax
rates
to
railroads
or
less
blatantly
by
over
valuing
railroad
property
compared
to
other
property.
now,
in
that
earlier
case,
the
railroad
challenged
only
how
the
state
applied
its
method
for
figuring
out
the
value
of
railroad
property
rather
than
the
method
itself.
we
had
no
occasion,
therefore,
to
decide
whether
the
statute
permits
railroads
to
dispute
the
underlying
valuation
methods
chosen
by
the
state,
thatâ€™s
the
question
presented
by
today's
case.
csx
transportation
is
a
freight
rail
carrier
with
multiple
routes
across
the
state
of
georgia.
in
2002,
georgia
charged
csx
almost
50%
more
in
property
taxes
than
it
had
the
previous
year.
csx
sued
under
the
4-r
act,
claiming
that
georgia
had
dramatically
overvalued
its
in-state
rail
property
by
changing
the
valuation
methods
it
used
to
assess
their
property.
the
district
court
ruled
for
georgia,
a
divided
panel
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
both
courts
reasoned
that
the
4-r
act
does
not
allow
railroads
to
challenge
the
state's
valuation
methods,
but
only
the
application
of
those
methods.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse.
the
text
of
the
act
draws
no
distinction
between
valuation
methods
and
the
application
of
those
methods.
instead,
the
act
clearly
prevents
states
from
taxing
railroad
property
at
a
ratio
of
assessed
to
true
market
value
that
is
higher
than
the
comparable
ratio
for
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
the
state.
in
order
to
perform
that
required
comparison,
courts
must
calculate
the
true
market
value
of
railroad
property
and
in
order
to
do
that,
they
must
be
able
to
look
behind
the
state's
choice
of
valuation
methods.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
