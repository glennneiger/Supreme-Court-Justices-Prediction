mr.
warren
r.
calvert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
subsection
(b)(1)
constitutes
a
narrow
exception
to
the
normal
rule
of
federal
non-interference
in
state
tax
administration
that
is
designed
to
prohibit
a
specific
type
of
tax
discrimination.
what
csx
contends
here
is
that
congress
meant
this
anti-discrimination
provision
to
secure
for
the
railroads
what
no
other
taxpayer
to
our
knowledge
currently
has.
and
that
is
an...
an
absolute
right
to
come
into
federal
court,
and
to
have
a
federal
judge
redetermine
the
market
value
of
its
property
for
state
property
tax
purposes
in
whatever
manner
the
federal
court
finds
to
be
appropriate,
without
regard
to
the
state's
choice
of
a
reasonable
valuation
method.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
what
it
plainly
says.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
it
requires
the
comparison
of--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
it
has
to
find
the
assessed
value
of
the
railroad,
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroads--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think
in
large
part,
the
railroad's
argument
is
it
places
on
the
one
word
"true"
and
the
term
"true
market
value"
a
weight
that
it
cannot
bear.
the
complaint
that
the
railroads
filed
in
this
case,
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history,
acknowledged
that
the
word
"true
market
value"
meant
the
same
as
"fair
market
value"
or
"market
value".
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
think
if
congress
had
said
the
district
court
is
to
find
fair
market
value
or
the
market
value
it
would
seem...
it
would
seem
less
strange.
and
we
think
there
is
going
to
be
a
range...
any
case
like
this
as
evidenced
by
the
appraisals...
the
appraisal
prepared
by
the
railroad's
appraiser,
as
evidenced
by
the
state's
appraiser.
there
is
going
to
be
a
range
of
possible
market
values.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor
i
think
in
the
same
way
that
csx--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
your
honor,
the
way
that
the
railroad
says
you
have
to
look
for
the
one
value
that's
true,
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute
said
"fair
market
value"
the
question
is
there
could
be
many
market
values
that
are
fair.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
i
think...
i
think
there
is
a
range
of
possible
market
values
that
can
be
considered
fair.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
would
say
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
would
say
that
the
statute
does
not
plainly
lead
to
that
result.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
again,
your
honor--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
possible
to
say
with
any
type
of
absolute
certainty
or
precision
that
one--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
again,
if
the...
if
the
statute
had
said
what
it
easily
could
have
said
and
what
the
legislative
history
says
it
could
have
said
and
what
csx
complaint
in
this
case
acknowledged
it
could
have
said,
that
what
the
district
court
had
to
find
was
the
market
value
of
the
property.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
statute
does
not
plainly
require
that
if
a
state
has
determined
the
market
value
of
the
railroad
by
correctly
applying
a
reasonable
valuation
method,
that
the
statute
an
ambiguously
allows
the
taxpayer
to
come
in
and
challenge
that...
not
just
the
application
of
that
method
but
the...
but
the
methodology
itself.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
your
honor,
i
think
what
csx
would
like
in
this
case
is
to
turn
the
federal
district
court,
the
judge
into
a
board
of
equalization
who
has
to...
who
has
to
consider
every...
each
and
every
objection
to
each
and
every
decision
that
the
state
that
is
made
in
valuing
its
property.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
our
position.
in
fact,
the
objections
that
csx
had
specifically
to
the
state's
application
of
the
discounted
cash
flow
were
more
than
what
could
be
fairly
described
as
checking
the
math.
it
wasn't
a
situation
where
one
number
had
had
the
decimal
point
in
the
wrong
place
but
there
was...
there
was
days
of
expert
testimony,
for
example,
regarding
whether
the
state's
use
of
a
6.3
terminal
growth
rate
in
the
discounted
cash
flow
was
an
appropriate
number
for
this
railroad.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
that
among
other--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
we
think
it
is...
the
difference,
your
honor,
is,
while
we
believe
that
a
state
should
have...
should
have
the
right
to
choose
among
the
various
reasonable
types
of
valuation
methods
that
can
be
used
in
a
case
like
this--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
because
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
the
state
can
choose
the
valuation
formula;
it's
another
thing
that
the
state
is
able
to
dictate
how
you
fill
in
the
variables.
if
a
state
can
say
we're
going
to
use
the
discounted
cash
flow
analysis
but
here's
the
way
we're
going
to--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
what
you
have
to
find
in
the
statute,
because
this
is
a
limited
exception
to
the
rule
that
federal
courts
will
not
interfere
with
the
state's
administration
of
its
own
tax
system,
is...
i
think
you
need
to
find
something
in
the
statute
which
plainly
allows
the
federal
courts
to
get
into
the
minutia
of
not
just
the
way
in
which
the
discounted
cash
flow
formula
has
been
applied
or
not
the
way
in
which
a
stock-and-debt
formula
has
been
applied,
but
its
choice
at
the...
at
the
very
beginning
to
use
those
methodologies.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
guess...
your
honor,
i
think
it's
specifically
because
there
is
that
range
of
value,
that
if
congress
had
intended
to...
that
the
district
courts
would
examine
each
and
every
decision
made
by
the
states
deciding
it's
going
to
use
this
method--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think...
i
think
the
result
of
that,
your
honor,
is...
is
you're
going
to
have
a
federal
court
setting
a
federal
standard
of
valuation
for
georgia.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
that's
what...
that's
what
csx
is...
is
arguing
here
today,
but
that's
not
what
they
argued
in
the
district
court.
they--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what
csx
asked
in
this
case
is
that...
they
have
taken
the
position,
and
i
believe
they
still
take
it
for
this
court,
that
a
stock-and-debt
method
will
never
give
a
reliable
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
railroad.
so
they
want...
what
they
want
to
come
out
of
this
litigation
is
the
state
of
georgia
cannot
use
that
at
all.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i'm
that
trying
to
make
is
that
what
they...
what
they
want
to
see
come
out
of
this
case
is
the
state
of
georgia...
not
simply
that
the
state
of
georgia
couldn't
use
the
stock-and-debt
methodology
for
this
tax
year;
they
want
a
ruling
that
basically
says
it
can't
use
it
for
any
year.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
but...
but
your
honor,
that
is
what
they
tried
to
get
from
the
district
court
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
and
that
is
what
we
did
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
again,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
a
state
could
do
that.
you're
still
within
the
range
of
value.
i
will
say
this.
if
the
state
had
done
that
in
an
effort
to
overvalue
the
railroads,
or
to
discriminate
against
them
or
to
treat
them
differently
than
other
taxpayers,
i
think
you
might
have
a
problem
under
the
statute,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
problem
under
(b)(1).
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem
under
(b)(4)
which
is
the--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--no,
your
honor.
he's
done
well
over
a
thousand
appraisals
involving
the
application
of
the
unit
rule.
what
he
had...
what
he
had
not
done
before
is
provide
a
written
narrative
report
much
like
the
railroad's
appraiser
did,
but
the
valuation
work
sheets
that
are
attached
as
part
of
the
joint
exhibit
basically
set
out
the
calculations.
then
when
he
did
his
full
appraisal
report,
it
includes
certain
narrative
materials,
certain
explanation
of
the
various
methods
he
used.
but--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--no.
the
state's
appraiser,
your
honor,
had
done,
had
done
well
over...
well
over
a
thousand
of
these
types
of
appraisals.
he
has
taught
in
national
schools
on
these
issues.
he
has
published
in
state
and
national
journals
on
these
issues,
so
we
contend
that
his...
his
credentials
are--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--yes.
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
we
have
our
own
footnote.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
that
is
footnote
3,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
of
our
brief.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
this
is
a...
this
is
a
special
statute
and
again
i
think
what
csx
is
asking
for
this...
for
this
court
to
do
is
create
a
special
rule
for
it
which
gives
it,
unique
among
taxpayers,
as
far
as
we
are
aware,
the
right
to
come
into
federal
court
and
challenge
each
and
every
decision
that
the
state
has
made
in
valuing
property
for
property
taxes
and
have
the
federal
court
redetermine
that
value.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
the
district
court
could
certainly
thoroughly
examine
the
way
in
which
the...
the
reasonable
valuation
methodologies
that
the
state
selected
were
applied.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well...
well,
your
honor,
we
think
the
methodology
has
to
at
least
be
reasonable.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
think
if
the
state
has
used--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i'd
say
that's
correct.
if
it's
a
widely
used
accepted
valuation
methodology
like
the
ones
the
state
used
in
this
case,
that
the
question--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--the--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--both
sides
agree
that
the
unit
rule
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
the
question
then
is
how
to...
how
to
determine
what
the
unit
value
of
the
company
was;
but
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
unit
rule
is
appropriate.
so
the
appraisals
that
the
state's
appraiser
had
performed
under
the
unit
rule
are
exactly
the
type
of
appraisals--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--than
the
railroad
did.
correct.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
right.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
i
could
make...
if
i
could
make
one
point
about
the
unit
rule
and
the
choice
between
the
unit
rule
and
what
we
refer
to
as
the
summation
approach,
the
specific
dispute
in
this
case
has
been
between
the
various
methods
for
determining
what
the
unit
value
of
the
company
was
for
2002
under
the
unit
rule...
but
the
argument
that
csx
is
making
in
this
case
would
also
put...
put
into
play
a
state's
most
fundamental
methodological
choice
between
the
unit
rule
and
the
summation
approaches,
and
csx's
reply
brief
admits
as
such.
the
railroads
had
made...
had
made
such
an
argument
in
the
chesapeake
western
case
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
where...
where
virginia's
courts
had
held
that
the
unit
rule
was
not
an
appropriate
valuation
method
under
their
statutes
to
arrive
at
fair
market
value,
the
railroads
came
in
and
said
under
the
4-r
act,
we
are
entitled
to
put
on
proof
under
the
unit
rule
as
to
what
our
fair
market
value,
that
the
federal
statute
makes
all
that
open;
the
district
court
has
to
consider
all
that
evidence.
and
what
the...
and
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
that
argument,
but
that's
the
implication.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well
i
think
the
problem,
your
honor,
with
reproduction
cost
is...
is
how
to...
is
how
to
accurately
account
for
obsolescence.
my
understanding
of
the
objection--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--it's
possible,
your
honor,
that
a
reproduction
cost
methodology
might...
might
so
inadequately
deal
with
the
issue
of
obsolescence
that
you
just
have
to
say
that's
not
a
reasonable
methodology,
as
applied
to
railroads.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
pardon
me?
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
court
is
allowed
to
examine
whether
you
have
a...
whether
the
state
has
used
a
reasonable
methodology.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
you
have
properly
applied
a
reasonable
valuation
method,
and
there
is--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think
it
depends,
your
honor,
on
if
you
have
a
reproduction
cost
method
that
you
have
applied
to
property
that...
property
that
has
only
just
recently
been
purchased,
then
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
have
a
problem
with
it
at
all,
even--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i...
i
think
that
is
possible.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well
again,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in...
in...
in...
again,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
argument
they
have
made
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well
again,
i
think
that
goes
to
whether
the
application
is
going
to
be...
is
going
to
be
reasonable
in
the
particular
situation.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
i--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--and
i...
i
think,
if
you
looked
at
the
mid-point
of
the
ranges
that
each...
each
of
the
appraisers
had,
you
would
have
a
variation,
maybe,
of
about
20
percent
either
way.
again,
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
determinative
as
to
whether
you've
got
a
reasonable
methodology,
whether
it's
been
properly
applied,
and
what
that
range
is.
i
think
that's
the
nature
of
the...
of
the
appraisal
task
that
states
have.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
what
happens,
your
honor,
is
that
the
railroad
returns
are
filed
with
the
state;
and
there
is
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
state
examines
those
returns,
takes
the
evaluation
methodologies
that
it
has
selected,
applies
it
to
the
data
that
it
has
for
those
particular
companies,
comes
up
with
numbers.
those...
that
information,
typically,
is
shared
with
the
railroads.
for
them
to
come
back
and
say:
well,
we
think
you've
used
cost
of
capital
that's
too
low;
we
think
you've
done...
done
this;
this
number
really,
we
believe,
should
be--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--typically,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
think...
i
think
the
majority
of
states
that
value
railroad
property
use
the
unit
rule.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--we
are,
your
honor,
though
if
a
state
is
using
a
different
methodology
to
determine
the
unit
rule,
i
think
you
would
probably
expect--
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
--i
think
it
probably
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
i
think
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
the
state
of
georgia's
unit
value,
at
least
within
the
southeast
states,
was...
was
the
largest
number.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
r.
calvert
well,
your
honor,
i
think
our...
our
response
is
that
we
believe
that
in
2002
what
the
state
did
was
not
only
to
make
some
changes
in
its
valuation
methodologies,
but
it
also
made
a
fairly
significant
change
in
the
income
numbers
that
the
state
was
using
to
apply
its
discounted
cash
flow
analysis.
and
specifically
what
it
did:
it
started
using...
instead
of
numbers
from
the
regulatory
report,
the
r-1
report
that
the
railroads
filed
with
the
surface
transportation
board,
it
began
to
use
income
numbers
from
the
annual
reports
to
shareholders.
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
those
numbers,
and
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
that
the
47
percent
increase
that
csx
saw
in
its
assessment
from
2001
to
2002
was
attributable
to
the
difference
in
the
income
numbers
that
were
being
used.
i
suspect
that
for
many
of
the
other
states
that
have
low
numbers
for
csx,
that
they
still
use
numbers
from
the
regulatory
reports
as
opposed
to
the
annual
reports.
so
that's
one
reason
that
i
believe
we've
got...
we
had
such
a
larger
number
for
2002
than
many
other
states,
because
our
appraiser
was
looking
to
the
correct
income
numbers.
if
i
could,
just
in
the
remaining
time
that
i've
got,
i'd
like
to
mention
a
couple
of
points.
the
csx
has
contended
that
this
line
between
method
and
application
is
simply
unworkable;
and,
therefore,
the
court
shouldn't
recognize
any...
any
such
distinction
under
the
statute.
we
think
there
are
a
couple
points
where
the
lines
are
clear.
one
is
between
the
unit
rule
and
the
summation
approaches.
the
brief
filed
by
the
association
of
american
railroads
acknowledges
that
those
are
two
different
methods.
it's
not...
one
could
not
say
that
a
stock
and
debt
method
is
just
an
application
of
discounted
cash
flow,
so
there
are
certain
places
where
those
lines
are
clear.
we
believe
the
fact
that
the
line
may
not
always
be...
or
the
boundaries
may
not
always
be
perfectly
distinct,
or
that
the
test
may
not
always
be
what
it
might
be
easy
to
describe
in
the
abstract...
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
distinction
should
not
be
recognized
at
all
under
the
statute.
also,
there
is
the
way
in
which
the
eleventh
circuit
formulated
the
test
where
the
eleventh
circuit
said
a
line
bar
between
method
and
application
was
between
nonfactual
determinations
used
in
constructing
the
valuation
process,
however
broad
or
narrow
they
might
be.
the
court
said
that
constitutes
the
method.
everything
else
is
an
application.
the
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
their
brief
that...
that
that
means
as
long
as
the
state
can
announce
or
can
set
out
its
valuation
rule
in
general
enough
terms,
make
it
general
enough,
then
that
will
become
part
of
the
method
and
not
part
of
the
application.
i
think
if
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
read
in
context,
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
say
that.
specifically,
the
eleventh
circuit
was
distinct...
was
saying...
was
rejecting
the
argument
in
that
case
that
only
the
distinction
between
the
unit
rule
and
the
summation
approach
is...
was
the
only
methodological
distinction.
and
the
court
was
saying:
we
think
that
differences
in
methodologies
include
the
stock
and
debt,
the
discounted
cash
flow,
and
the
market
multiples
approaches
used
in
this
case.
so
the
eleventh
circuit
did
go
and
consider
the
argument
that
the
state
had...
should
not
have
used
a
6.3
percent
terminal
growth
rate
in
the
discounted
cash
flow
analysis
even
though
that
it
used
that
in...
in
all...
for
all
public
utilities.
