mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
one
of
the
federal
government's
most
important
tools
for
incapacitating
serial
offenders
who
commit
serious
crimes,
and,
like
other
federal
recidivism
statutes,
the
acca
defines
the
prior
offenses
that
trigger
its
application
based
partly
upon
the
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
those
offenses.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
relevant
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
an
offender
who
was
already
a
repeat
offender
is
the
maximum
to
which
repeat
offenders
were
subject
to
that
offense.
alone
among
the
circuits,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
relevant
maximum
for
a
repeat
offender
is
instead
the
maximum
to
which
first-time
offenders
were
subject,
even
though
that
purported
maximum
would
sometimes
be
lower
than
the
term
that
a
repeated
offender
would
actually
receive.
because
the
acca
cannot
support
that
counterintuitive
and
counterfactual
approach,
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that
is
because,
justice
scalia,
we
believe
that
the
text
of
the
acca
naturally
accommodates
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
alternative
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
a
given
offense.
the
provision
the
acca
at
issue,
section
924(e)(2)(a)(ii),
defines
a
serious
drug
offense
as
"a
state
drug
trafficking
offense
for
which
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
by
law.
"
and
we
believe
that
that
language
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
the
maximum
for
a
repeat
offender
is
the
maximum
to
which
repeat
offenders
were
subject
and
the
maximum
for
a
first-time
offender
is
the
maximum
to
which
first-time
offenders
were
subject.
and
that
is
particularly
true
because
congress--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
to
be
sure,
justice--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--to
be
sure,
justice
scalia,
the
acca
speaks
of
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense.
but
a
higher
sentence
for
repeat
offenders
is
no
less
a
maximum
for
the
offense
than
the
lower
sentence
for
first-time
offenders.
this
court's
cases
involving
challenges
to
recidivism
statutes
make
that
clear
because
they
have
uniformly
held
that
a
recidivism
enhancement
constitutes
a
stiffened
penalty
for
an
underlying
offense.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
don't
that
we're
flinching
from
those
consequences,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
it
is
simply
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
does
speak
of
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense,
not
for
the
offender.
and,
while
we
believe--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--it
is
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
can
be
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
there
can
be
alternative
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
broad
categories
of
offenders,
such
as
recidivists
and
non-recidivists.
but
we
don't
think
that
it
can--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it
would
lead
to
harsh
results
for
first-time
offenders
and
we
certainly
think
that
congress--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
correct.
but
with
regard
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
we
simply
believe
that
the
text
of
the
statute
cannot
be
stretched
to
accommodate
the
possibility
of
individualized
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
every
offender
based
on
the
potentially
infinite
combinations
of
facts
that
may
determine
an
offender's
guidelines
range.
and
i
think
it's
important
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
probably
the
closest
analog
in
the
criminal
code,
justice
kennedy,
would
be
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
rlc.
i
believe
it's
18
u.s.c.
5037(c)(1)(b),
which
provided
at
the
time
that
the
court
was
construing
it
that
the
maximum...
that
the
sentence
that
a
juvenile
should
receive
should
be
no
higher
than
the
maximum
that
an
adult
offender
should
receive.
and
the
court
did
construe
that
statute
to
refer
to
the
maximum
that
an
adult
could
receive
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
focused
on
categories
of
offenders
and
there
congress's
concern
was
obviously
with
career
offenders.
but
i
think
critically
in
the
labonte
opinion
itself,
written
by
justice
thomas
for
the
court,
the
court
recognized
the
possibility
that
a
statute
could
establish
alternative
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
recidivist
and
nonrecidivist
offenders.
the
court
specifically
discussed
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
does
exactly
that.
now,
to
be
sure
the
language
of
that
statute
was
somewhat
different,
but
in
our
view
the
critical
lesson
of
labonte
is
simply
that
it
is
possible
for
a
statute
to
establish
alternative
maximums
and
the
statute
at
issue
here
no
less
than
the
statute
at
issue
in
labonte
accommodates
that
possibility.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
it
would
be
easier
to
accept
that
if
a
state--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--if
a
state,
justice
scalia
were
to
essentially
define
a
new
crime
of
drug
trafficking
by
a
recidivist,
then
to
be
sure
by
definition
the
maximum
sentence
for
that
offense
would
be
the
maximum
to
which
repeat
offenders
were
subject.
but
to
say
one
more
thing
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
guidelines
maximums,
i
do
think
that
it
is
critical
to
remember
that
congress
enacted
the
acca
in
its
present
form
in
1986,
well
before
this
court's
apprendi
jurisprudence
took
root,
and
at
that
time
congress
surely
would
have
conceived
of
the
relevant
maximum
as
the
offense-specific
statutory
maximum,
and
we
know
that
congress
viewed
that
maximum
as
a
discrete
creature
from
the
relevant
guidelines
maximum
because
in
passing
the
sentencing
reform
act
2
years
earlier,
the
statute
that
gave
rise
to
the
federal
guidelines,
congress
smoke
specifically
about
statutory
maximums
as
distinct
from
guidelines
maximums.
and
certainly
we
believe--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--one
of
the
virtues
of
our
approach,
justice
alito,
is
that
the
answer
is
in
some
sense
the
same
whether
a
legislature
defines
drug
trafficking
by
a
recidivist
as
a
distinct
offense
or
whether
recidivism
is
simply
a
sentencing
factor
that
gives
rise
to
an
alternative
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
underlying
offense
of
drug
trafficking.
and
our
fundamental
submission
with
regard
to
the
court's
apprendi
line
of
cases
is
simply
that
it
alters
nothing
with
regard
to
how
the
acca
should
be
interpreted
because,
again,
congress
was
defining
1986
in
its
colloquial
sense
as
essentially
what
the
legislature
defines
the
offense
to
be.
and
to
be
sure,
it
is
a
prerequisite
for
a
fact
to
be
an
offense
element
that
it
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
but
all
this
court
did
in
apprendi
line
of
cases
was
effectively
to
state
a
procedural
constitutional
rule
under
which
a
sentencing
factor
that
raises
the
applicable
maximum
sentence
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes,
that's
correct.
in
the
federal
system,
that
would
of
course
be
the
statutory
maximum.
in
some
state
systems,
of
course,
the
guidelines
are
themselves
statutory
and
for
that
reason
we
refer
to
them
in
our
brief
as
offense-specific
maximums.
but
the
critical
point
with
regard
to
the
sentencing
reform
act
is
that
congress
did
believe
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
maximum
for
the
offense,
and
indeed
in
section
994(r)
of
title
28,
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
sentencing
reform
act,
congress
actually
asked
the
sentencing
commission
to
come
back
with
recommendations
to
alter
those
offense-specific
maximums,
which
we
believe
is
certainly
evidence
that
congress
viewed
that
as
something
distinct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
our
position,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
it
would
count
because
the
relevant
inquiry
is
whether
the
offender
was
potentially
eligible
for
an
enhanced
maximum
sentence
as
a
repeat
offender
as
a
substantive
matter.
that
having
been
said,
we
certainly
believe
that
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
a
court
applying
the
acca
will
merely
need
to
resort
to
the
judgments
of
conviction
or
other
judicial
records
in
order
to
determine
the
maximum
to
which
the
defendant
was
actually
subject.
and
this
case
of
course
presents
a
perfect
example
of
that
because
the
judgments
for
each
of
respondent's
prior
convictions
made
clear
that
he
was
in
fact
subject
to
a
10-year
maximum
sentence
as
a
repeat
offender.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
if
there
were
such
a
dispute,
certainly
we
believe,
first
of
all,
that
acca
courts
would
be
perfectly
competent
to
resolve
those
disputes.
they
are
no
different
in
kind
from
the
sorts
of
legal
and
factual
issues--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
our
view,
justice
stevens,
is
that
once
the
government
comes
forward,
for
example,
with
a
judgment
of
conviction
that
indicates
that
the
defendant
was
subject
to
a
10-year
maximum,
it
would
then
be
incumbent
on
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
evidence
suggesting
that
that
was
erroneous
to
the
extent
that
a
defendant
would
be
permitted
to
collaterally
challenge
that
prior
sentence
at
all.
but
we
do
believe
that
courts
can
resolve
those
disputes.
now,
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
and
to
conclude
that,
for
comparable
reasons
to
the
reasons
that
the
court
articulated
in
shepard,
it
would
be
difficult
for
courts
to
resolve
those
determinations,
then
i
suppose
that
we
could
live
with
a
rule
that
said
that
the
government
is
limited
to
judicial
records
like
a
judgment
of
conviction.
but
taylor
and
shepard
of
course
were
dealing
with
a
quite
different
concern,
the
concern
of
how
to
define
the
prior
offense,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
factual
disputes
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
shepard
are
quite
different
from
disputes
about
the
applicability
of
a
recidivism
enhancement.
those
were
disputes
about
the
actual
underlying
facts
of
the
underlying
substantive
offense
itself.
and
the
court
suggested
in
the
plurality
portion
of
justice
souter's
opinion
that
resolving
those
sorts
of
factual
disputes
might
raise
constitutional
concerns.
but
we
certainly
believe
that
by
virtue
of
the
rule
of
almendarez-torres,
at
a
minimum
the
resolution
of
factual
disputes
ancillary
to
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
almendarez-torres
rule
and
present
no
constitutional
difficulties.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
that
issue
would
arise,
of
course,
only
under
the
definition
of
"violent
felony",
which
sets
a
one-year
trigger
rather
than
the
ten-year
trigger
that
is
contained
in
the
definition
of
"serious
drug
offense".
i
think
that
the
only
point
that
i
would
note
is
that,
with
regard
to
an
offense
that
remains
a
misdemeanor,
even
when
it
is
committed
by
a
repeat
offender,
there
is
a
distinct
statutory
provision
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
18
u.s.c.
921(a)(20),
which
tinkers
with
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
qualifying
offense
for
purposes
of
the
definition
of
"violent
felony".
it
says
that
if
it's
a
misdemeanor,
the
sentence,
the
applicable
sentence,
actually
has
to
be
two
years
or
more.
but
where
a
state
actually
says
that
when
you
commit
an
offense
and
it
becomes
a
felony
when
you
are
a
recidivist,
then
certainly
we
think
that
there
is
no
problem
with
treating
such
an
offense
as
an
acca
predicate
for
purposes
of
the
triggering
maximum
term
of
imprisonment.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
souter,
and
i
believe
that
that
was
actually
the
fact
pattern
that
was
presented
in
the
acca
case
that
this
court
heard
earlier
this
term,
logan.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
in
a
footnote
in
its
opinion,
the
court
noted
this
very
peculiarity
of
how
acca
operates
and
how
you
need
to
have
a
two-year
maximum
rather
than
a
one-year
maximum
if
the
state
still
treats
the
offense
as
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
states
do
have
somewhat
different
rules,
justice
ginsburg,
as
respondent
correctly
points
out,
though
i
would
note
that
many
of
the
sort
of
factual
and
legal
issues
that
would
arise
under
those
different
rules
arise
outside
the
drug-trafficking
context.
most
states'
drug-trafficking
recidivism
provisions,
as
least
those
states
that
have
adopted
the
uniform
controlled
substances
act
provision,
operate
in
a
quite
straightforward
manner
because
they
essentially
sweep
in
all
prior
drug
offenses.
that
having
been
said,
we
are
unaware
of
any
acca
cases
that
have
presented
those
sorts
of
difficulties.
and
typically
what
one
would
find,
if
one
looked
at
respondent's
cases,
is
that
most
states
by
now
have
fairly
clearly
defined
rules
for
determining
when
an
out-of-state
conviction
qualifies.
and
so
at
most,
if
it
were
unclear
from
the
judgment
of
the
prior
conviction
whether
the
prior
sentencing
court
had
determined
whether
the
defendant
was
subject
to
the
enhanced
maximum
as
a
recidivist,
it
would
be
a
relatively
easy
task
for
a
federal
acca
court
to
apply
those
largely
settled
rules
in
order
to
make
that
determination.
i
do
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
the
text
of
the
acca
more
generally,
and
that
is
that
if
the
court,
as
justice
scalia
had
suggested
at
the
outset,
were
to
conclude
that
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
there
can
be
only
a
single
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
a
given
offense,
we
believe
that
it
would
not
necessarily
follow
that
respondent's
interpretation
is
correct,
and
indeed
that
the
more
natural
consequence
of
that
interpretation
would
be
that
the
relevant
maximum
is
the
maximum
that
any
offender
could
receive,
rather
than
the
maximum
that
a
first-time
offender
could
receive,
and
that
is
because--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that
might
be
true
as
a
numerical
matter,
though,
you
know,
i
suspect
that
there
are
probably
more
recidivist
offenders
than
one
might
think.
but
i
think
that
the
fundamental
difficulty
with
respondent's
interpretation
is
the
anomaly
that
i
identified
at
the
outset,
namely
that
even
an
offender
who
actually
received
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
could
be
said
to
have
a
maximum
of
5
years.
and
while
it
is
true
that--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
disagree.
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
has
to
choose
a
single
maximum
it
has
to
be
the
maximum
that
the
worst
offender
could
receive.
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
when
one
thinks
about
the
maximum--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
correct,
and
that's
because
of
the
statute's
reference
to
the
offense
and
not
the
offender.
but
my
submission
is
simply
that
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
there
has
to
be
one
maximum
and
indeed
if
the
court
thinks
that
that
interpretation
is
compelled,
then
we
would
submit
that
all
offenders
who
commit
an
offense
for
which
some
offenders
could
receive
a
10-year
sentence
would
be
subject
to
the
acca.
but
we
of
course
primarily
submit
that
the
statute
is
not
only
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
we
advance
here,
but
that
it
is
the
better
interpretation,
namely
that
a
statute
can
have
alternative
maximums.
and
we
certainly
believe
that
that
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
long
history
and
widespread
practice
of
imposing
enhanced
penalties
on
repeat
offenders,
a
practice
that
congress
surely
was
aware
of
when
it
enacted
this
statute
dealing
with
the
problem
of
recidivism.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
difference,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
statute
does
speak
of
maximum
terms
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense
and
not
the
offender,
and,
while
we
certainly
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
with
its
reference
to
"a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment"
can
naturally
accommodate
the
possibility
of
alternative
maximums
for
broad
tiers
of
offenders
such
as
recidivists
and
nonrecidivists,
we
really
don't
believe
that
it
can
accommodate
the
possibility
of
individualized
maximums
for
every
offender.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
in
a
sentencing
guidelines
system
where
being
a
ringleader
may
be
the
basis
for
an
enhancement,
as
it
is
in
the
federal
system,
the
fact
remains
that
an
enhancement
under
a
guidelines
system
is
merely
one
of
many
factors
that
ultimately
determine
the
offender's
guideline
sentence.
a
guideline
sentence
is,
of
course,
an
individualized
determination
made
after
a
court
evaluates
a
panoply
of
offender
and
offense-specific
factors.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
believe
that
such
an
enhancement
could
be
subject
to
our
alternative
maximums
approach
as
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
standard
was--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
if
a
statute
is
as
a
formal
matter
structured
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
broad
tiers
of
punishment
for
categories
of
offenders,
then
certainly
that
would
seem
to
be
an
alternative
maximum
term
of
imprisonment.
the
guideline
systems,
of
course,
are
not
structured
in
that
way.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
right.
well,
that's
correct,
and
so
in
apprendi,
of
course,
i
think
it
was
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
acted
with
a
biased
purpose,
and
that
form
of
structuring
of
statutes
was
not
unheard
of
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
apprendi.
and
essentially
what
new
jersey
did,
as
i
recall,
in
apprendi
was
to
say
that
if
you
unlawfully
possess
a
firearm
your
maximum
is
10
years.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
the
relevant
question,
justice
stevens--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--this
case
does
not
present
that
issue;
and,
in
light
of
the
history
and
practice
of
imposing
heightened
penalties
on
recidivists,
an
essentially
universal
practice
as
far
as
we're
aware
in
the
drug-trafficking
context,
we
certainly
don't
believe
that
the
court
has
to
address
that
issue.
and,
in
any
event,
after
this
court's
decision
in
apprendi,
it
is
certainly
true
that
states
have
made
modifications
to
the
structure
of
their
offenses
and
their
sentencing
systems
such
that,
with
regard
to
factors
other
than
recidivism,
it
may
very
well
be
that
as
a
prospective
matter
that
issue
would
not
arise
very
frequently.
and--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and,
with
regard
to
a
state
that
does
that
as
washington,
indeed,
has
done
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
decision
in
blakely,
we
believe
that
the
relevant
offense
and
the
relevant
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
actually
remains
the
same.
and
that
is
simply
because
where
all
a
state
does
is
to
say
that
sentencing
factors
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
order
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
rule
of
apprendi
and
blakely,
the
fact
remains
that
the
state
has
not
redefined
the
offense.
in
our
view,
a
sentencing
factor
can
remain
a
sentencing
factor
even
if
it
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
offense
element
for
apprendi
purposes.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
suppose
that
may
be
true,
justice
kennedy,
though
again
the
statute
spoke
about
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
the
offense,
which
i
think
presupposes,
at
least
to
some
extent,
that
the
maximum
may
be
higher
than
the
maximum
to
which
a
particular
offender
is
subject.
i
think
the
only
thing
i
would
say
with
regard
to
the
reference
to
acca
is
that
one
could
naturally
understand
that
phrase
being
used
by
a
congress
that
was
acting
in
1986
as
referring
to
the
prescribed
statutory
maximum.
and,
notably,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case
that
we
cite
in
our
opening
brief,
united
states
v.
parry,
construed
that
phrase
in
exactly
that
manner
in
actually
holding
that,
notwithstanding
its
rule
in
this
case,
the
applicable
maximum
for
a
defendant
sentenced
under
a
mandatory
guidelines
system
cannot
be
the
applicable
guidelines
maximum;
it
has
to
be
the
maximum
for
the
offense.
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
only
insofar
as
it
thought
that
that
maximum
is
the
maximum
to
which
first-time
offenders
were
subject,
even
for
a
repeat
offender.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
souter,
an
enhanced
penalty
for
repeat
offenders
is
every
bit
as
much
a
penalty
for
the
offense
as
the
lower
penalty
for
first-time
offenders.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
and
that
is
a
question
that
this
court
has
answered
in
a
variety
of
different
contexts
dating
back
almost
a
hundred
years
to
graham
v.
west
virginia.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
principle
is
certainly
equally
applicable
here,
and
a
penalty
for
a
recidivist,
while
in
some
sense
holding
a
recidivist
more
responsible
by
virtue
of
his
or
her
recidivist
status,
is
every
bit
as
much
a
penalty
for
the
offense.
and
under
our
alternative
maximums
approach
that
can
be
the
maximum
for
the
underlying
offense.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
just
two
points
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
rebuttal:
the
first
is
that
the
government
believes
that
the
rule
of
lenity
is
inapplicable
here
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
believe
that
the
text
of
the
statute
is
not
susceptible
to
respondent's
interpretation.
and
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
statute
does
permit
the
interpretation
that
a
given
offense
can
have
only
a
single
maximum
term
of
imprisonment,
we
believe
that
the
only
logical
conclusion
is
that
that
maximum
is
the
maximum
that
any
offender
could
receive,
not
that
the
maximum...
not
that
it
is
the
maximum
that
some
better-positioned
subset
of
offenders
could
receive.
and
while
we
do
believe
that
the
considerations
that
underlie
the
rule
of
lenity
have
less
force
in
this
context,
and
the
court
has
never
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
to
the
acca,
we
ultimately
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
text
does
not
permit
respondent's
interpretation
is
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
the
other
point
that
i
would
just
make
is
that
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
respondent's
interpretation,
it
would
have
pernicious
consequences,
not
only
for
the
acca,
but
likely
also
for
a
number
of
other
critically
important
federal
statutes
as
well.
with
regard
to
the
acca
itself,
both
the
definition
of
28
states
and
the
federal
government
have
drug-trafficking
offenses
that
would
qualify
as
acca
predicates
for
repeat
offenders
under
the
government's
interpretation
but
not
under
respondent's.
and
with
regard
to
other
statutes
similar
language
appears--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
mean
only
to
highlight
the
practical
significance
of
this
issue,
justice
scalia,
and
again,
certainly
in
enacting
a
statute
that
itself
deals
with
the
problem
of
recidivism,
we
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
be
insensitive
to
an
offender's
past
recidivism.
but
with
regard
to
other
statutes,
i
want
to
note
that
similar
language
also
appears
in
the
federal
three-strikes
law
and
in
the
controlled
substances
act,
which
along
with
the
acca,
are
among
the
most
important
federal
statutes
dealing
with
a
problem
of
recidivism.
and
similar
language
also
appears
in
a
number
of
general
federal
criminal
statutes,
including
rico
and
the
very
substantive
statute
at
issue
here,
the
felony
possession
statute.
and
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation,
it
could
potentially
lead
to
the
narrowing
of
all
of
those
statutes
as
well.
the
ninth
circuit,
alone
among
the
circuits,
has
adopted
this
view
that
the
relevant
maximum
for
an
offense
must
be
the
maximum
that
first-time
offenders
receive.
we
believe
that
that
is
erroneous
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
