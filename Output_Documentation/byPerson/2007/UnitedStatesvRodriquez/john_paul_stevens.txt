i
take
it...
supposing
there's
a
dispute
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
was
a
recidivist
or
not.
is
the
fact
that
there
was
just
an
argument
that
he
would
be
a
recidivist
enough
or
does
the
record
have
to
establish
that
he
was
a
recidivist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
shouldn't
the
mere
existence
of
a
dispute
be
enough,
because
then
at
least
he's
potentially
subject
to
being
treated
as
a
recidivist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
you
treat
an
enhancement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it's
not
just
recidivist
and
non-recidivist.
it's
some
enhancements,
but
not
all
enhancements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
depending
upon
the
guidelines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
my
point
is
i
don't
think
your
proposal
just
has
two
categories.
there...
it
seems
there
could
be
multiple
kinds
of
enhancements
that
would
fit
your
general
description.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
just
recidivist
versus
nonrecidivist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
recidivist
doesn't
necessarily
be
a
recidivist
because
he
committed
the
same
crime
three
times.
he
might
have
done
two
very
different
things
under
the
california
three-strike
law.
sometimes
very
minor
crimes
push
the
person
over
to
qualify
as
a
recidivist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
you
must
look
at
the
second
offense
as
the
offense,
not
the
offender.
i
mean,
the
prior
conduct
is...
is
not
being
punished
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
