chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
06-1646,
united
states
v.
rodriguez.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
seem
to...
you
seem
to
flinch
from
the
natural
consequences
of
your
position
in
not
looking
at
the
maximum
for
a
particular
offender.
for
example,
you
know,
under
some
guidelines,
if
he
was
the
ringleader
his
sentence
can
be
enhanced
beyond
what
would
otherwise
be
the
maximum
for
a
first-time
offender,
but
you
say
you
don't
take
that
into
consideration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
different
from
your
position
here,
where
it
is
the
fact
that
the
individual
is
a
recidivist
that
causes
you
to
look
to
a
different
maximum?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that's
the
reason
you
sort
of
pull
back
from
a
more
aggressive
reading,
because
it's
not
as
broad
a
category?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
only
if
they're
subject...
only
if
they
have
some
characteristic
that
had
caused
the
state
legislature
to
give
the
higher
maximum,
such
as
being
the
ringleader
or
some
other
enhancement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
surely
not,
mr.
shanmugam.
you
were
talking
about
broad
categories
earlier.
it
seemed
that
the
broad
category
in
the
situation
you
posit
would
be
the
normal
offender
rather
than
the
recidivist,
and
that's
the
one
we
ought
to
look
at.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
you
began
your
discussion
by
saying
we
had
to
choose
one
maximum.
you
were
accepting
that
requirement.
it
seems
to
me,
if
that's
the
case,
it's
clear
that
we
ought
to
pick
the
maximum
for
the
particular
offense
without
considering
additional
enhancements.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
don't
accept
that
approach
when
we're
talking
about
enhancements
under
state
guidelines.
you
know,
if
the
normal
sentence
is
whatever
it
is,
10
years,
and
you
get
an
extra
2
years
if
you're
the
ringleader,
you
say
no,
you
don't
look
at
that;
you
just
look
at
the
10
years.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
isn't
it
pertinent,
mr.
rothfeld,
that
in
trying
to
decide
whether
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
encompasses
recidivists,
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
itself
is
directed
to
recidivism.
you're
asking...
you've
got
three
previous
convictions
and
then
you
get
a
particularly
harsh
sentence.
if
recidivism
is
what
you're
trying
to
address,
it
would
seem
to
me
in
deciding
what
a
maximum
term
is
that
it
would
be
natural
to
assume
that
they
would
take
recidivism
into
consideration
in
that
context
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
congress
addressing
what
they
regarded
as
a
very
serious
problem
of
recidivism,
they
would
think
that
that's
a
problem
that
should
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
what
maximum
sentences
you're
subject
to
under
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
know
it
was
focusing
on
the
particular
problem
of
recidivism.
that's
what
the
overarching
federal
statute
is
directed
to.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
think,
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
you
would
assume
that
this
congress
thought
that
recidivists
presented
particular
problems
that
were
different
from
the
one
particular
offense.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
flip
side
of
that
hypothetical
is
somebody
selling
a
ton
of
marijuana.
it's
the
same
offense
as
somebody
who's
done
it
and
been
convicted
of
it
three
different
times.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
your
hypothetical
helps
advance
the
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
you
were
representing
a...
a
defendant
who
has
two
prior
convictions
for
something
that
has
a
sentence
of
8
years,
and
on
the
third
one
he
is
subject
to
a
sentence
of
15
years;
and
your
initial
meeting,
the
first
thing
he
wants
to
know
is
what's
the
maximum
that
i'm
facing?
would
you
tell
him
it's
8
years
or
would
you
tell
him
it's
15
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
government
of
course
responds
to
your
rule
of
lenity
argument
by
saying
it
loses
a
lot
of
its
force
when
we
are
talking
about
how...
the
degree
of
sentencing
rather
than
whether
conduct
is
subject
to
a
criminal
sanction
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
someone
who
is,
you
know,
we
are
trying
to
decide
whether
he
is
subject
to
20
years
in
jail
or
30
years
in
jail,
invoking
the
rule
of
lenity
is
a
little
bit...
it's
not
the
same
as
somebody
who
comes
in
and
says
i
didn't
know
this
was
a
crime
at
all,
because
it's
so
vaguely
written.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
know...
we
know
that
someone's
liberty
is
going
to
be
taken
away
in
a
case
like
this;
it's
just
a
question
of
for
how
long.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is...
it
is
a
fundamental
verbal
embarrassment
for
your
argument
that
you
would
say
in
a
particular
case
that
the
maximum
to
which
someone
is
subject
is
say,
5
years,
and
that
person
is
in
fact
sentenced
to
15
years.
it's
just
the...
the
words
don't
fit
together
under
that
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
i
thought
their
argument
was
you
look
at
broad
categories
rather
than
individual
characteristics.
it's
not
a
one-way
ratchet
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
shanmugam,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
shanmugam.
the
case
is
submitted.
