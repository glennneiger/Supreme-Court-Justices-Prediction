are
there
any
statutes
which
talk
about
offender
as
opposed
to
"offense"
in
this
area,
do
you
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
might
be
slightly
better
if
the
statutory
term
was
"authorized",
not
"prescribed".
i
don't
say
"prescribed"
could
never
be
used
in
the
sense
you
mean,
but
when
you
have
alternates
we
usually
would
use
the
word...
alternate
possibilities...
usually
you'd
use
the
word
"authorize"
rather
than
"prescribe".
"prescribe"
indicates
one
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
it's
a
victimless
crime,
that
the
second
offense
is
no
more
injurious
to
the
state
than
the
first
was.
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
case.
the
fact
that
the
state
sees
multiple
offenders,
repeat
offenders,
in
its
community
means
that
they
have
to
spend
extra
resources
to
prevent...
to
incarcerate
them
because
they
have
a
network
of
distributors,
et
cetera.
they
are
more
experienced,
so
they
are
more
dangerous
to
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
offense
is
the
same.
i
think
the
injury
to
the
state
is
compounded
by
the
repetition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
affects
the
tone
of
the
community,
the
number
of
law
enforcement
officers
we
have
to
have,
the
cost
of
reincarceration,
rehabilitation,
etcetera.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
what
i'm
addressing.
it
could
be
more
serious
when
it's
the
second
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
offense
in
and
of
itself.
