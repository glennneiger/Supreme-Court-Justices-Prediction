mr.
shanmugam,
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
a
person
who
is
not
a
repeat
offender?
he
commits
the
crime
for
the
first-time.
now
the
government
says
there
are
alternative
maximums
and
you
have
to
pick
whichever
maximum
is
the
higher.
why
wouldn't
that
maximum
apply
to
the
person
who
commits
the
crime
the
first-time?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
adding
something
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
and
in
all
of
our
cases
in
this
field
we
look
to
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
far
as
the
elements
are
concerned,
the
maximum
sentence
for
those
elements
you
say
is
the
sentence
that
would
be
imposed
upon
a
repeat
offender.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
was
also
the
statute
involved
in
the
labonte
case,
where...
where
the
statute
said
the
sentencing
commission
"shall
assure
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
specify
a
sentence
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
at
or
near
the
maximum
term
authorized
for
categories
of
defendants
who
have
certain
types
of
prior
convictions.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
did
focus
on
the...
on
the
nature
of
the
defendant
and
not
on
the
element
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
be
easy,
of
course,
if
recidivism
were
an
element
of
the
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
crime
which
includes
the
act
plus
the
recidivism?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
i
didn't
understand
what
you
said
about
congress's
intent
with
regard
to
the
guidelines
when
it
passed
acca.
you're
saying
congress
did
not
have
an
eye
to
the
guidelines,
but
simply
had
an
eye
to
the
maximum
sentence
within
which
the
guidelines
were
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
would
you
explain
to
me
again
why...
why
you
treat
the
enhancement
in
a
state
guideline
system
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
get
an
enhancement
as
a
ringleader
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
you
get
an
enhancement
because
you're
a
recidivist.
what's
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
"ringleader"
is
a
broad
tier.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
some
of
them
have
simply
said,
we're
going
to
let
the
jury
decide.
we're
going
to
let
the
jury
make
these
determinations
that
apprendi
says
have
to
be
made
by
the
jury.
but
they're
still...
they're
still
referred
to
as
sentencing
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
question
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
more
serious
offense
when
she
does
it
the
second
time;
it's
just
a
more
culpable
offender.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
is
correct,
though,
that
when
a
recidivist
is
sentenced
he
is
being
punished
for
the
crime,
not
for
his
recidivism.
so
you...
you
can
say
that
the
punishment
for
that
defined
crime
is
10
years
when,
when
the
person
who
committed
the
act
is
a
recidivist,
but
the
act
he's
being
punished
for
is
the
same
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
have
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
to
sentencing
in
the
past,
haven't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
good
or
bad,
depending
upon
whether...
whether
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
right
or
the
other
side's.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
good
to
put
more
people
in
jail?
i
mean,
that
isn't
necessarily
what
we're
after.
we're--
