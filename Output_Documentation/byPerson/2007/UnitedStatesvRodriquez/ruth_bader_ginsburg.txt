justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
matter
what
was
the
sentence
actually
imposed
in
the
state
court?
that
is,
suppose
it
is
a
second
offense,
but
the
prosecutor
chooses
not
to
charge
as
a
second
offender
and
so,
although
it
is
in
fact
the
second
offense,
he
is
sentenced
in
the
state
court
as
a
first
offender.
would
it
count
under
your
reading
of
the
federal
statute
that
it
was
a
second
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
all
states
treat
first
convictions
from
other
states...
do
they
all
count
for
recidivism
qualification
if
the
prior
offense
was
committed
and
the
conviction
was
in
another
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
did
use
the
language
"a
maximum
term",
not
"the
maximum
term",
which
would
support
the
government's
view
that
the
statute
contemplates
more
than
one
maximum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
defendant's
own
understanding?
in
connection
with
one
of
these
offenses
the
defendant
acknowledged
in
court,
the
crime
with
which
i
am
charged
carries
a
maximum
sentence
of
10
years.
