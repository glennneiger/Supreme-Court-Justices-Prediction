justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
going
back
to
what
you
first
said,
suppose
with
your
own
children:
i
told
you
half
an
hour
ago
not
to
interrupt
your
sister
when
she
is
doing
her
homework.
this
is
the
second
time
you've
done
it.
wouldn't
you,
with
your
own
child...
i
would
with
mine...
think
that
the
second
time
he
did
it
was
worse
behavior
than
the
first
time?
i
just
told
him
not
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it's
absolutely
right
i
don't
see
why
we
hold
congress
to
some
kind
of
weird...
not
weird,
but
more
picky
standard
than
we
do
with
our
own
children.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
their
behavior
is
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
what
i
tell
my
child.
i
say
you
behaved
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
does
the
word
"offense"...
i
haven't
come
across
it,
but
does
the
word
"offense"
have
some
kind
of
special
technical
meaning
that
doesn't
just
mean
the
behavior
which
calls
into
play
all
kinds
of
circumstances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
part
i'm
not
getting.
i
mean,
that's
why
it
doesn't
help
your
client.
in
general,
if
you
did
read
the
word
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed,
you'd
say,
well
what
is
the
maximum
term
prescribed
for
the
offense
of
selling
drugs?
and
the
answer
would
be
10
years.
now,
how
do
you
get
out
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
because...
because
fewer
people
are
likely
to
get
the
10-year
sentence
than
get
the
five-year
sentence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is...
what
is
the
distinguishing...
how
do
you
get
out
of
it?
i
know
you're
trying
to
say
this
and
i'm
just
not
getting
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it's
bank
robbery...
bank
robbery,
force
or
threat
of
force
guidelines.
if
you
have
a
gun,
eight
years.
if
you
brandish
it,
four
more
years.
if
you
take,
you
know,
$10
as
opposed
to
$50,
two
years,
eight
years,
six
years.
the
statute,
by
the
way,
says
a
max
of
20
years.
now,
what's
the...
what's...
does
this
fall
within
it?
doesn't
it?
does
it
depend
on
whether
he
brandished
it?
what
does
it
depend
on,
in
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
what
he
actually
faced...
that,
i
agree
with
you,
that
won't
work
because
of
the
guidelines,
if
they
were
mandatory.
but
what
they're
saying
here
is
it's
right
in
the
statute.
you
just
look
at
the
statute
that
has
the
definition
of
what
the
offense
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
back
to
the
same
question
then.
i
mean
which
one
do
we
pick?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
that
my
question
is
going
in
the
exact
opposite
way.
what
i
am
finding
hard
is
once
you
distinguish
offender
and
offense
characteristics
in
the
way
you
do,
why
not
jump
to
the
max
for
the
offense?
and
so
i'm
asking
you,
how
is
it
you
get
out
of
that?
which
is
the
same
question
i
had
before.
i'm
not
so
worried
about
your
case
as
i
am
other
cases.
