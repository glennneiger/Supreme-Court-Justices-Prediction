mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
a
number
of
serious
problems
with
the
government's
theory
in
this
case,
and
i'll
start
with
this
one.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
language
of
acca,
as
is
suggested
by
the
r.l.c.
and
labonte
decisions
that
have
been
discussed
already;
and
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
fundamental
purpose
of
acca,
which
is
reflected
in
that
statutory
language.
congress
enacted
acca
to
target
particular
categories
of
serious
offenses.
whether
the
defendant
is
a
repeat
offender
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
that
he
committed
and
therefore
tells
us
nothing
about
whether
that
offense
should
be
treated
as
an
acca--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
that
latter
provision
includes
as
an
element
of
the
offense
that
recidivism,
that
could
be
a
different
situation
than
we
have
here,
because
the
statutory
language
of
acca,
as
mr.
shanmugam
said,
focuses
on
"offense".
congress
said
that
an
acca
predicate
in
the
drug
context
is
an
offense
for
which
a
maximum
penalty
of
ten
years
or
more
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that's
a
difficult
question,
your
honor,
which
is
not
the
question
here.
i
suppose
i
would
say
the
language
would
suggest
that
it
would
be;
that
if
it
is
an
element
to
the
offense
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
of
an
offense
that
includes
recidivism
as
an
element,
that
statutory
language
would
lead
us
in
that
direction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
would
suggest,
again,
it
depends
upon
what
the
element
defined
by
the
state
legislature
is
in
creating
the
offense,
because
that
follows
from
the
acca
term
of
the
offense,
the
punishment
prescribed
by
law
for
the
offense.
that
is,
of
course,
not
the
question
here.
and
it's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
in
the
post-blakely
context
one
could
say
something
that
has
to
be
proven
to
a
jury
is
in
fact
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
offence
may
essentially
be
defined
in
terms
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
elements
at
that
point.
but
i
think
in
figuring
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
used
the
term
defining
acca
serious
drug
offense>
["]
as
"an
offense
for
which
a
maximum
penalty
of
ten
years
is
prescribed
by
law,
we
have
to
figure
out
what
is
the
offense
and
what
is
the
penalty
prescribed
by
law
for
that.
"
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
a
familiar
example,
your
honor.
[laughter]
and...
and
it's
absolutely
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
in
this
context
is
the
language
that
congress
chose.
it
is
certainly
correct
that,
generally
speaking,
it
is
thought
that
repeat
offenders
should
be
subject
to
a
higher
punishment,
and
that
there
is
a--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
but
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
whether
the
offense
itself
is
a
more
serious
offense.
i
mean,
the
acca
statutory
language
uses
the
term
"serious
drug
offense".
that's
part
of
the
definition
that's
used
in
the
statutory
text.
congress
had
in
mind
punishing
through
the
acca
process
offenses
that
have
a
certain
level
of
seriousness.
and
when
congress
did
that
it
was
reflecting
on
what
people
actually
did.
that's
the
whole
context
of
this
court's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
precisely
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
can't
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
this
is...
this
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
the
court
has...
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
distinction
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
latest
question,
which
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
offense
and
the
offender.
as
mr.
shanmugam
said...
and
we
agree
completely...
acca
is
an
offense-specific
provision.
it
does
not
focus
on
the
offender.
the
government
would
like
to
read
acca
as
though
it
made
a
distinction
based
upon
different
categories
of
defendants.
and
it's
interesting
that
the
way
in
which
the
question
is
presented
in
their
brief
and
in
their
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
not
in
terms
of
the
acca
statutory
language.
it
does
not
ask:
what
is
the
penalty
prescribed
by
law
for
this
offense?
it
asks:
could
repeat
offenders
be
subjected
to
an
enhanced
penalty
of
ten
years?
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
acca
is
a
particular
kind
of
recidivism
statute.
there
are
recidivism
statutes
common
in
the
states
now,
with
the
three
strikes
regime
becoming
ubiquitous,
in
which
all
that
matters
is
basically
the
number
of
offenses
that
were
committed.
the
states
expressly
disavow
the
seriousness
of
the
offenses
that
constitute
the
predicates
in
those
kind
of
regime.
acca
is
different
kind
of
statute.
acca
was
motivated
because
congress
was
concerned
that
there
was
a
small
cohort
of
offenders
who
are
engaging
repeatedly
in
serious
offenses,
and
congress
had
in
mind
that
people
who
engaged
repeatedly
in
these
especially
threatening,
dangerous,
harmful
offenses,
very
destructive
to
society,
they
should
be
segregated
for
15
years
through
the
acca
mandatory
minimum.
but
congress
was
quite
clear,
and
the
statutory
language
reflects
this
expressly,
that
the
predictates
have
to
themselves
be
serious
offenses.
congress
was
concerned
with
what
people
did.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
they
could
have
done
that.
they
could...
and
that
would
have
been
the
statute
the
government
is
discussing,
one
which
ties
recidivism
into
the
particular
category
of
the
offender
and
the
penalties
to
which
they
are
subject.
but
congress
did
not
do
that.
congress
focused
specifically
on
the
seriousness
of
each
of
the
individual
predicate
offenses.
and
it
had
in
mind
what
people
actually
did,
whether
the
kinds
of
offenses
they
were
committing
were
serious
destructive
types
of
offenses.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that's
one
of
the
government's
odder
arguments.
i
think
that
reading
any
significance
to
the
use
of
"the"
rather
than
"the"
in
this
context
is
quite
peculiar.
i
would
think
if
a
judge,
for
example,
is
pronouncing
sentencing
he
or
she
is
likely
to
say
"i
sentence
you
to
a
term
of
10
years.
"
not
"i
sentence
you
to
the
term
of
10
years.
"
certainly
the
use
of
doesn't
suggest
some
contemplation
of
multiple
alternative
regimes
of
punishment.
so
i
think
the
government,
i
give
them
kudos
for
creativity
there,
but
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
read
any
conscious
choice
by
congress
in
the
use
of
the
different
article.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
there
are
two
things
to
say
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
question
how
seriously
anyone
took
that
statement
in
the
sentencing
declaration,
because
what
really
mattered
in
washington
state
was
the
binding
determinant
sentencing
guideline,
which
set
a
maximum
term
of
57
months,
which
everyone
agrees
was
the
highest
penalty
this
defendant
could
receive.
in
fact,
it's
quite
clear
that,
absent
aggravating
circumstances,
which
are
not
present
in
this
case,
no
one
convicted
of
this
defendant's
crime
could
receive
a
punishment,
recidivist
or
not,
of
10
years,
enough
to
trigger
the
acca
predicate.
so,
i
question
again
whether
or
not
anyone
took
that
terribly
seriously.
but
i
think
even
if
one
did,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
here.
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
a
recidivism
provision
which,
at
least
in
some
theoretical
sense,
made
the
maximum
penalty
10
years.
there
is
also
a
statutory
provision
which
defined
the
crime.
and
in
that...
in
that
statutory
provision
the
washington
legislature
specifically
associated
with
conviction
of
that
offense
a
five-year
maximum
penalty.
and
i
think
it
sort
of...
it
sort
of
begs
the
question
to
say,
as
the
government
does,
well,
the
fact
that
there
is
some
possibility
out
there
of
an
enhancement
that
increases
the
penalty
above
10
years,
even
if
that
were
true,
which
is
not,
again
because
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
in
this
case,
that
sort
of
begs
the
question
of
what
is
the
relevant
offense?
is
the
relevant
offense
what
you
might
call
the
generic
categorical
offense
of
distribution
of
schedule
3,
4,
or
5
drugs,
the
sentence
to
which
anyone
convicted
of
that
crime,
anyone
who
engaged
in
the
elements
of
that
offense
and
is
found
guilty
in
washington
state
could
have
been
sentenced
to,
and
that
is
5
years.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
the
defendant
here
committed
this
offense
and
he
is
being
punished
for
it,
for
that
offense.
but
again,
i
think
that
begs
the
question
here:
when
congress
uses
the
term
"the
punishment
prescribed
by
law
for
the
offense.
"
what
did
it
have
in
mind?
did
it
mean
sort
of
the
generic
sense
of
the
offense
in
the
sense
of
the
offense
that
anyone
commits
who
is
guilty
or
who
commits
the
elements
of
the
offense,
which
is
someone
who
is
not
a
recidivist.
it's
entirely...
recidivism
is
unrelated
to
that
because
recidivism
is
not
an
element
of
this
offense.
so
yes,
the
defendant
here
committed
the
offense.
he's
being
punished
for
having
committed
this
offense.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
no,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
that
i
think
congress
looked
at
it
when
it
wrote
the
statutory
language
here.
congress
had
in
mind...
as
i
said
to
chief
justice
roberts,
congress
had
in
mind
people
who
engage
in
serious
offenses.
congress
had
in
mind
what
people
actually
did.
it
was
not
passing
a
generic...
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
statutory
language,
it
was
not
passing
a
generic
three
strikes
statute.
it
was
focusing
on
the
seriousness
of
what
people
did
and
what
people
actually
did,
what
they
were
actually
convicted
of
doing.
and
i
think
for
that
purpose,
again
the
sort
of
what
you
might
call
the
generic
or
categorical
offense,
the
offense
unrelated
to
recidivism
enhancements,
is
what's
relevant
because
that
is
what
the
person
actually
did.
and
once
you
bring
recidivism
into
the
picture,
once
when
the
three
strikes
brings
recidivism
into
the
picture,
every
drug
distribution,
every
drug
distribution
offense,
will
become
a
serious
offense
within
the
meaning
of
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
is
no
question
that
recidivism
is
regarded
as...
as,
you
know,
a
bad
thing
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
and
that
is
why
recidivism
enhancements
have
been...
are
so
common.
and
no
one,
no
one
disputes
that.
the
question
is
when
congress
wrote
this
statutory
language
and
wrote
this
particular
kind
of
recidivism
offense
in
acca,
it
was
focusing
on
what
the
defendants
actually
did.
the
recidivism
enhancement
is
entirely
unrelated
to
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
that
recidivism
statute,
but
it
is...
again
it's
a
particular
kind
of
recidivism
statute
different
in
character
from
the
three-strikes
kind
of
statute,
different
in
character
from
the...
the
drug
recidivism
statute
in
washington
state,
which
is...
which
is
to
be
a
player.
those
statutes
do
not
care
whether
the
predicate
acts
that...
that
trigger
their
application
were
serious
offenses
or
not.
they
simply
ask
is
this...
is
this
defendant
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
offenses
in
the
past.
acca
is
not
like
that.
acca
specifically
targets
serious
predicate
offenses.
the...
the
statutory
text
defines
two
categories
of
predicate
offenses:
violent
felonies,
which...
which
are
a
set
of
especially
dangerous,
threatening
offenses;
and
serious
drug
offenses,
using
the
term
"serious
in
the
text.
"
"it
is
clear
from
that
congress
had
in
mind
people
who
were
engaged
in
acts
that
are
themselves
harmful,
destructive,
serious
acts.
"
"under
the
government's
application
of
a
recidivism
approach,
virtually
anything
that
someone
is
convicted
of
having
to
do
with
drug
distribution...
handing
a
single
marijuana
cigarette
to
a
friend...
that
is
a
drug
distribution
offense.
"
"in
most
states
that
is
punishable
by
two
years,
five
years
maximum.
"
"under
the
government's
approach
that
is
now,
because
it
could
through
the
recidivism
policy
lead
to
a
10-year--
"
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if...
if
the
crime
in
which
the
individual
engaged,
selling
a
ton
of
marijuana,
is
going
to
be
punished
by
ten
years,
in
virtually
every
jurisdiction...
i
would
suggest
in
every
jurisdiction...
therefore
it's
going
to
be
a
serious
drug
offense
within
the
meaning
of
acca
and
it's
going
to
trigger
acca
as
a
predicate.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
that's
absolutely...
absolutely
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i...
i
think
that
that's
right
and
it
is
reflective
of
something
that...
discussing
earlier
with
justice
breyer.
the
offense
itself
is
not
regarded
as
a
more
serious
offense
when
it's
committed
by
a
recidivist.
it's
because
the
recidivist's
character
as
a
repeat
offender
is
what
triggers
the
higher
penalty;
and
in
the
acca
context
where
congress
was
focusing
on
whether
or
not
this
person
was
engaging
in
particular
kinds
of
crimes,
particular
kinds
of
serious
crimes,
that
makes
all
the
difference.
i...
i
return
to
cases
that
some
members
of
the
court
were
discussing
with
mr.
shanmugam,
the
labonte
case.
the
government
would
like
to
focus
on
the
status
of
this
defendant
as
a
repeat
offender.
that's
what
triggers
in
their
view
the
application
of
acca;
because
he
is
a
repeat
offender
he
is
in
a
class
of
defendants
who
are
subject
to
higher
punishment,
therefore
10-year
acca
trigger.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think...
again,
i
don't
disagree
with
any
of
that,
as
to
the
consequence
of
a
repeat
offense.
my
question
is
whether
congress,
when
it
used
the
term
serious
offense,
whether
it
thought
the
offense
itself
was
more
serious,
as
distinct
from
punishment
that
might...
that
might
be
imposed
upon
the
offender.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
it's...
it's
instructive
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
labonte
case
which
was...
which
discussed
during
mr.
shanmugam's
argument,
in
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
i...
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
in
the
cases
that
are...
and
we
agree
by
cases
cited
by
the
government
for
this
proposition...
that
when
you
are
sentenced
as
a
recidivist
to
a
higher
penalty
you
are
being
punished
for
the
most
recent
offense
that
you
were...
that
you
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
would
say
that
because
you
are
a
recidivist
the
maximum
you
are
facing
is
15
years.
but
i
would
not
say
that
the
offense
that
you
committed
is
a
more
serious
offense
because
you
are
a
repeat
offender.
and
and
the
labonte
statute
i
think
illustrates
this
very
nicely.
in
the...
in
the
statute
the
court
construed
in
labonte
it
referred
to
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
for
specified
categories
of
defendants;
and
the
court
found
that
language
was
crucial
because
it
showed
that
congress
contemplated
that
there
would
be
different
terms
of
imprisonment
for
defendants
falling
into
different
categories
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i...
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
need
go
no
further
at
that
point,
because
the
rule
of
lenity
would
dictate
ruling
for
us.
absolutely.
it's--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we
do
not.
i
think
one
way
to
consider
the
case
is
that
there
in
fact
are
three
statutes
which
bear
on
the
question
of
penalty.
there
is
the
statute
that
created
the
crime
of
conviction,
which
created
the...
the
offense
of
a
distribution
of
a
schedule
of
3,
4,
or
5
drugs,
and
in
that
statute
specifically
associated
with
the
offense
is
the
5-year
penalty.
there
is
the
10-year,
potential
10-year
penalty
which
is
focused...
focus
of
the
government's
case.
there
is
the
washington
state
sentencing
guidelines,
which
were
binding,
determinate
guidelines,
every
bit
as
much
part
of
washington
statutory
law
as
the
recidivism
statute--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--they
do
say
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that's
simply
not
so.
i
mean,
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
and
has
applied
repeatedly
the
doctrine
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
when
the
only
question
is
the
length
of
the
sentence;
and
indeed
the
r.l.c.
case
which
the
government
has
been
discussing
was
a
case
which
involved
only
a
question
of
length
of
the
sentence
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
the
court
has
said
consistently
that
one
of
the
elements
supporting
the
rule
of
lenity
is
the
idea
that
somebody's
liberty
is
going
to
be
taken
away,
that
congress
should
have
spoken,
to
some
degree--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
but...
but
it's
a
profound
difference.
i
mean,
a
the
conviction
of
a
felony
possession
of
a
gun,
the
variations
in
penalty
can
be
zero.
absent
acca,
you
could
be
sentenced
to
probation,
maximum
of
10
years,
as
opposed
to
the
mandatory
minimum
15-year
sentence
under
acca.
that's
a
profound
deprivation
of
liberty
based
upon
how...
what
reading
you
give
to
these
words.
so...
and
again--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--absolutely.
again
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
our
briefs,
the
bifulco
case...
but
the
r.l.c.
case,
which
both
parties
have
discussed
at
some
length,
is
a
prime
element
in
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i...
i
am
not
embarrassed
by
that,
your
honor.
perhaps
i,
i'm
too
resistant
to
embarrassment.
but
i...--
[laughter]
--i
think
it's...
it's
entirely
a
question
of
how
you
take
the
congressional
meaning
of
the
term
punishment
prescribed
for
the
offense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that...
that
is
exactly
right.
we
think
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
referred
to
the
punishment
prescribed
by
law
for
the
offense
it
was
referring
to
the
offense,
the
offense
of
conviction;
and
it
never--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well
again,
that's...
that's
where
we
started,
justice
alito.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i...
i
think
if
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense
then
you
would
be
convicted
of
an
offense
which
carried
in
its
weight
recidivism,
and
so
i
would
say
yes,
in
that
circumstance
that
would
be
a
different
situation
than
what
we
have
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
whether
it
actually
is
an
element
of
the
offence...
i
mean,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question;
everyone
agrees
it's
not
in
the
offense;
the
government
concedes
that
it's
not
an
element
to
the
offense.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
glad
you
bring
up
the
guidelines,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
that
is
an
element
that
we
haven't
discussed
at
some
length.
the
government's
test
is
what
is
the
penalty
that
the
defendant
actually
faced.
i
mean
that's
their--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--aha,
but
it's
not
the
definition
of
the
offense.
this
statute...
the
definition
of
the
offense
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i...
i
guess
there
are
two
points
here...
the
first
on
the
question
of
the
guidelines.
to
the
extent
that
the
government
believes
in
its
test,
which
is
what
is
the
sentence
that
the
defendant
actually
faced,
there
is
no
question
that
the
sentence
the
defendant
actually
faced
here
was
57
months,
well
below
the
10-year
acca
trigger.
and
the
government
does
not
offer
any
explanation
that
i
can
understand
as
to
why,
if
their
test
applies,
one
takes
recidivism
enhancements
into
effect,
but
does
not
take
guidelines
reductions
into
effect.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
way...
the
way
we
resolve
that,
justice
breyer,
is
what
was
suggested
by
justice
souter's
question.
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
offense
without
the
overlay
of
a
recidivism
enhancement,
which
is
not
an
element
of
this
offense.
one
looks
at
the
offense,
one
looks
at
the
commission
of
the
elements,
if
you
commit
the
elements,
what
does
that
subject...
what
kind
of
punishment
does
that
subject
you
to?
if
it's
less
than
10
years,
acca
does
not
apply.
if
you
have
to
call
into
the
mix
enhancements
that
are
unrelated,
that
are
offender-specific
and
not
offense-specific,
that's
falls
out
because
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
referred
to
"punishment
prescribed
by
law
for
the
offense.
"
again,
congress
had
in
mind
a
limited
series
of
serious
offenses.
it
was
looking
at
what
people
did,
whether
they
engaged
in
the
kind
of
serious,
harmful,
destructive
conduct
that
was
sufficiently
bad
to
trigger
the
mandatory
15-year
sentence,
and
if
they
did
not,
the
fact
that
some
additional
overlay
could
be
used
to
enhance
their
sentence
is
not
what
congress
was
concerned
about
when
it
listed
acca
predicates.
and,
again,
i
don't
want
to
fall
away
from
the
sentencing
guidelines
point
because,
as
i
understood
mr.
shanmugam's
explanation
to
justice
scalia
as
to
why
the
guidelines
should
not
apply
if
enhancement
does
is
because,
well,
this
is
an
offender-specific...
an
offense-specific
crime,
and
congress
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
acca
had
in
mind
that
guidelines
in
the
statutory
regime
were
different.
but
so
far
as
the...
the
offense
has
been
defined
by
the...
by
the
statute,
the
relevant
offense
here
is
the
five-year
penalty
associated
with
that
offense.
and
so
i
think
that
if
one
is
going
to
go
beyond
that
and
say
we
are
going
to
look
for
things
that
are
outside
of
the
offense,
not
in
the
elements
of
the
offense,
to
increase
the
sentence,
as
the
government
does
with
the
recidivism
statute,
there
is
no
reason
why,
if
we
are
prepared
to
go
outside
of
the
offense
elements,
that
one
wouldn't
go
to
the
guidelines
as
well,
which
have
precisely
the
same
effect
in
the
other
way.
i
mean
the
government
ultimately
is
asking
for...
a
one-way
ratchet
that
if
it
increases
the
offense
level,
that's
okay,
but
if
it
decreases
the
punishment
for
some
reason,
that
doesn't
apply.
and
we
just
don't
see
any
principled
basis
for
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think,
in
terms
of
discussion
of
the
guidelines,
they
suggest
that
what
matters
is
whether
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
i
thought
that's
what
mr.
shanmugam's
response
was.
and
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
here.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you.
