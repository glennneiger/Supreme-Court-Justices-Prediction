justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shanmugam,
i
take
it
that
your
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
would
basically
be
your
response
to
the
argument
that
the
other
side
makes,
that
on
your
theory
a
state
misdemeanor
can
be
treated
for
purposes
of
the
act
as...
or
a
conviction
for
a
state
misdemeanor
can,
with
the
recidivism
enhancement,
be
treated
as
a
felony?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
continue
to
use
just
the
state
terminology
such
that
they
continue
to
use
the
word
"misdemeanor"
with
respect
to
an
offense,
which
with
the
enhancement
carries
more
than
a
one-year
penalty,
then
the
two-year
provision,
the
two-year
threshold
provision,
kicks
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
what
you
saw
as
the
anomaly
in
the
counter-argument,
the
anomaly
being
that
someone
with
the
recidivism
enhancement
could
end
up
with
a
ten-year
sentence
when
the
maximum
for
the
offense
is
five
years.
but
isn't...
isn't
the
answer
to
that
just
as...
as
the
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
scalia
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
simply
that
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
"offense"
so
that
there
is...
there
is
no
anomaly
in
getting
a
ten-year
sentence
for
something
which
for
this
purpose
carries
a
maximum
of
five?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rothfeld,
apropos
of
your
answers
to
justice...
first
to
justice
scalia
and
justice
breyer...
you
said
that
when
the...
when
the
recidivist
is
being
sentenced
he
is
being
sentenced
for
the
offense
of
the...
of
the
drug
crime.
isn't
it
equally
fair
or
wouldn't
it
be
equally
fair
to
say
that
he
is
being
sentenced
for
two
things?
he
is
being
sentenced
for
the
drug
crime
which
is
the
necessary
condition
of
the
sentence;
and
he
is
also
being
sentenced
for
the
fact
that
he
is
repeating
that
crime.
isn't...
isn't
it
fair
to...
to
sort
of
distinguish
between
the
two,
in
effect
the
two
factors
in
the
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
--each
one
of
which
is
necessary
for
the...
for
the
ultimate
sentence
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rothfeld,
let's
assume
we
get
into
conference
and
we
are
having
exactly
the
same
discussion
that's
been
going
on
for
40
minutes
there.
there
is
one
way
to
read
it;
there
is
another
way
to
read
it;
there
are
various
reasons
to
read
it
one
way,
various
ways
to
read
it
the
other
way.
what
do
we
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
don't
have
to
win
this
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the...
the
defendant
is
not,
this
defendant
is
not
subject
to
a
maximum
of
5
years,
but
gets
10.
i
thought
your
position
was
that
the
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
should
be
an
offense
which
carries
a
maximum
of
5
years,
but
that
this
defendant
is
in
fact
subject
to
a
maximum
of
10.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
can...
throughout
your
argument
you
make,
i
think
properly,
the
offense/offender
distinction,
and
isn't
that
the
answer
to
the
conundrum?
