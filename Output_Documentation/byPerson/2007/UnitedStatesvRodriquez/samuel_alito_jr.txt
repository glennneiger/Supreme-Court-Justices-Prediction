justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
light
of
apprendi
and
the
later
cases,
do
you
think
it's
feasible
any
longer
to
draw
a
distinction
between,
between
statutes
that
make
recidivism
an
element
of
the
offense
and
statutes
that
originally
conceived
of
recidivism
as
a
sentencing
factor
but
now
provide
for
that
to
be
proven
to
a
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
the
state
has
two
statutes:
possession
of
drugs,
maximum
penalty
five
years;
possession
of
drugs
by
a
convicted
felon,
maximum...
convicted
drug
felon,
maximum
penalty
ten
years.
and
a
defendant
is
convicted
under
the
latter
provision.
what
would
be
the
maximum
penalty
for
acca
purposes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
it
could
be
or
it
would
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
maximum
penalty
there
would
be
ten
years,
then
what
if
in
this
case
the
recidivist
element
had
been
submitted
to
a
jury
and
found
by
a
jury.
would
it
matter?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
should
the
label
matter?
maybe
as
to
statutes
that
were
passed
before
apprendi
and
booker,
that
at
that
time
it
made
a
difference.
but,
going
forward,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
labelled
as
an
element
of
the
offense
or
a
sentencing
enhancement
that's
proven
to
a
jury?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
offense
never...
the
offense
also
disregards
offender
characteristics,
or
only
those
offender
characteristics
that
are
not
elements
of
the
offense?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
still
not
sure
what
the
line
is
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
all
depends
whether
it's
labelled
an
element
of
the
offense
by
the
state
legislature?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can
see
how
anxious
i
am
to
make
this
announcement.[laughter]
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
rodriquez
was
convicted
of
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
convicted
felon.
under
the
arms
career
criminal
act,
he
faced
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
15
years
if
he
had
three
previous
convictions
for
a
violent
felony
or
serious
drug
offense.
at
issue
here
is
whether
two
of
respondents,
three
convictions
in
washington
state
court
for
delivery
of
a
controlled
substance
were
serious
drug
offenses.
serious
drug
offenses
are
defined
as
drug
trafficking
offenses
"for
which
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
or
more
is
prescribed
by
law".
under
washington
law,
the
maximum
sentence
for
delivery
of
a
controlled
substance
was
five
years
for
a
first
offence
but
10
years
for
subsequent
offenses.
thus,
under
these
washington
statutes,
respondent
could
have
been
sentenced
to
10
years
for
the
two
convictions
in
questions
but
the
sentencing
court
did
not
impose
the
maximum
term.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
these
convictions
did
not
qualify
as
serious
drug
offenses
because
the
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
should
be
determined
without
reference
to
recidivist
enhancements.
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
however,
the
convictions
in
question
fall
within
the
literal
meaning
of
the
definition
of
the
serious
drug
offense,
that
is
they
were
drug
offenses
for
which
a
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
of
10
years
was
prescribed
by
law.
for
this
reason
and
others
set
out
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reversed
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
souter
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
ginsburg
have
joined.
