yes,
but
it's
the
individual
who
has
to
file
the
1040.
what
the
trustee
is
filing
is
the
1041.
and...
and
why
do
you
place...
i
was
going
to
ask
the
same
question
that
justice
alito
did,
and
that
is
why
do
you
place
so
much
significance
either
in
the
label,
i.e.,
it's
fiduciary
return,
or
in
the
peculiar
fact
that
it
is
a
fiduciary
who
is
filing
that
return?
it's
a
tax
return
and...
and
i
think
your...
the
government's
argument
is
that
with
respect
to...
to
other
items
that
may
be
disputed,
you
should
regard
them
at
a
fairly
general
level,
i.e.,
investment
advice,
not
fiduciary
investment
advice.
but
when
you
come
to
the
tax
return,
you
don't
regard
it
as
a
general...
at
a
general
level;
you
regard
it
at
a
very
specific
level,
i.e.,
a
fiduciary
tax
return.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
with
respect
to
the
tax
return
is
doing
exactly
what
it
criticizes
the
taxpayer
for
doing
with
respect
to
investment
advice.
and
i
don't
understand
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
the
only
tax
return
that
the
fiduciary
has
to
file;
isn't
that
correct?
the
fiduciary
files
that
tax
return
and
the
beneficiary
files
a
1040.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
only
return
the
fiduciary's
filing
is
the
1041;
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay;
i
understand
that
that
is
a
factual
difference,
but
i
don't
understand
what
it
is
that
makes
that
a
difference
in
principle.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can't
you
ask
it...
can't...
can't
you
ask
this
question
pointing
towards
something
unique:
if
the
individual
investor
does
a
very
poor
job
of
managing
his
investments,
all
he
can
ultimately
do
is
cry
about
it.
but
if
the
trustee
does
a
very
poor
job,
the
trustee
is
going
to
get
sued.
so
that
when
the
trustee
asks
for
an
investment
advisor's
advice,
the
trustee
is
addressing
an
issue
that
the
individual
does
not
have.
the
trustee
wants
to
be
covered.
he
also,
i
presume,
wants
to
be
a
good
trustee.
but
he
is
in
fact
doing
something
which
is,
to
use
your
phrase,
in
addition
to
what
the
individual
investor
would
do.
he
is
looking
out
for
somebody
else
and
he
is
looking
out
for
himself
if
the
investment
goes
south.
why
isn't
that
a
sufficient
difference
that
is
at
least
comparable
to
the
difference
that
you
talk
about
in
the
filing
of
a
fiduciary
tax
return?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
whether...
whether
he
gets
socked
with
damages
or
not
is
going
to
depend
in
part
whether
he
is
covered
by
an
investment
advisor's
bit
of
advice;
and
that
is...
that
is
a
different
item
in
the
calculus
of
liability.
he
is
providing
for
something
that
the
individual
investor
does
not
provide
for
or
need
to
provide
for.
