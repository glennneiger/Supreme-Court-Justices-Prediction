but
have
they
issued
a
regulation
drawing
up
this
list
at
this
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
will,
you
give
as
an
example
of
something
that
wouldn't
fall
within
the
2
percent
floor
the
cost
of
preparing
and
filing
a
fiduciary
income
tax
return.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
getting
fiduciary
investment
advice?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
because
it's
a
different
form
that's
filled
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
more
expensive
to...
to
fill
out
a
1041
than
to
fill
out
the
1040?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
doesn't
your
proposed
regulation
concede
that
there
is
investment
advisory
advice
that
is
unique
to...
to
estates
and
trusts?
isn't
that
what
subparagraph
c
says?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
the
difficulty
is
in
characterizing
the
level
of
generality
at
which
you
describe
the
cost,
not
whether
it's
ordinary
or
customary
or
unique.
you
run
into
the
same
problem
no
matter
how
you
do
that,
but
you
have
to
decide
whether
you're
talking
about
investment
advice
or
fiduciary
investment
advice,
tax
preparation
costs
or
fiduciary
tax
preparation
costs.
and
what
is
the
formula
for
making
that
distinction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
do
we
deal
with
this
problem
until
there
is
a
regulation?
it
may
be
that
if
the
service
issues
a
regulation
and
says
that
these
fall
into
one
category
and
these
fall
into
the
other,
that
would
be
entitled
to
a
deference.
but
right
now
we
don't
have
a
regulation,
right?
so
what
do
we
do?
