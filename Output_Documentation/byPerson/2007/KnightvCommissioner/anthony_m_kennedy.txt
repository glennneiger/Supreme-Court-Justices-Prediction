i
think
those
three
points
are
certainly
what
would
help
me.
could
i
ask
just
two
preliminary
questions?
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
do
with
this
case,
just
to
get
something
straight.
i
take
it
that
you
couldn't
have
claimed
this
deduction
under
162
without
getting
into
an
argument
that
it
should
be
capitalized
and
that's
why
212
is
in
the
code?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
other
question
is
background
only.
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
government.
are
162
expenses
subject
to
the
2
percent
ceiling?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
just
simply
couldn't
have
been
congress's
purpose
in
passing
this
statute
because
now
you
have
a
recipe
for
avoidance.
in
most
states...
california
has
a
rule
that
the
trustee
has
to
make
prudent
business
investments.
i
assume
a
great
number
of
businessmen
outside
the
trust
context
think
that
they
have
their
principal
objective
of
making
prudent
business
investments.
but
under
your
theory
all
expenses
for
that
objective
would
fall
within
this
exclusion.
i
just
don't
think
that's
what
the
congress
could
possibly
have
intended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
true
just
in
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
universally,
there
is
never
a
danger
of
tax
avoidance?
you
want
us
to
write
the
decision
on
the
assumption
that
tax
avoidance
is
never
a
problem
in
the
creation
of
a
trust?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
can
rush
to
the
fallback
position,
is
it
acceptable
to
have
a
test
that
says
would
the
expense
have
been
incurred
if
the
nontrust
business
wanted
to
achieve
an
objective
that
the
trust
wanted
to
achieve
here,
fixing
the
roof?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
think
the
structure
of
the
statute
requires
us
to...
to
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
almost
sounds
like
ordinary
and
necessary
under
162?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
212.
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you
have
to
support
that?
i
resist
accepting
that
broad
proposition,
and
i
don't
know
where
to
look
or
who
to
ask
in
order
to
determine
its...
its
truth
or
falsity.
