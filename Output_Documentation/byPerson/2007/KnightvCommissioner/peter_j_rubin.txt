mr.
peter
j.
rubin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
the
meaning
of
a
statute
that
provides
that,
in
arriving
at
a
trust
or
estate's
adjusted
gross
income,
amounts
are
allowable
in
full
if
they
are...
and
i
quote
here
from
26
u.s.c.
section
67(e),
which
you
can
find
at
the
bottom
of
page
3a
of
the
appendix
to
the
blue
brief...
"costs
which
are
paid
or
incurred
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estate
or
trust
and
which
would
not
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
not
held
in
such
trust
or
estate.
"
i'd
like
to
make
three
broad
points.
first,
when
one
applies
the
judicial
tools
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
statute
can
mean
only
one
thing.
second,
"would
not"
does
not
mean
"could
not".
the
commissioner's
current
reading
of
the
statute
and
the
commissioner's
previous
readings
of
the
statute
are
wrong.
indeed,
the
logic
of
the
commissioner's
position
supports
us.
it
acknowledges
the
distinctive
nature
of
trusts
and
fiduciary
obligations.
finally,
our
reading
makes
sense.
it
is
consistent
with
the
treatment
of
trusts
and
estates
elsewhere
in
the
code.
it
puts
in
place
an
administrable
rule
that
draws
a
clear
line,
and
by
contrast
the
commissioner
has
provided
no
reason
at
all
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
subject
the
fees
at
issue
here
to
the
2
percent
floor.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
212
and
162
are
really
sort
of
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
162
is
for
costs
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business,
and
there's
no...
the
trust
isn't
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
any
more
than
an
individual
who
invests
for
the
protection
of
property
is
in
a
trade
or
business.
212,
by
contrast...
and
the
text
of
212
can
be
found
in
the
governor's...
the
government's
brief
appendix
at
5a...
212
is
about
expenditures
for
the
preservation
of
property
and
for
income
in
that
context.
so
that's
why
this
is
a
212,
not
a
162.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
my
recollection
is
that
162...
162
expenses
are
not
subject
to
the...
they're
not
miscellaneous
itemized
deductions.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that...
well,
there
are
really
two
things
built
into
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
is
the
question
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
tax
cases
specifically,
and
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
this
was
litigated
below
on
a
slightly
different
theory.
the
government's
theory
has
changed
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation.
and
below
they
argued
that
this
was
a
common
expense
for
individuals;
yet
they
introduced
no
evidence
of
that.
and
under
the
united
states
v.
janis,
this
court's
decision
in
that
case,
they
can't...
the
government
is
required
to
come
forward
with
something
before
assessing
tax.
but
in
terms
of
exceptions
and
rules,
we
can--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--they
might
hire
investment
advisors,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
think
that--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--i
don't
think
it's
clear
that
they
usually
hire
investment
advisors,
but
i
think
the
important
point
here,
in
a
way,
is
the
premise
of
your
question,
which
is
that
only
certain
trusts
with
certain
assets,
under
a
test
that
looked
at
what
the
commissioner
used
to
argue,
which
is
commonality
or
customariness
of
a
particular
expense,
only...
the
commissioner
herself
now
argues
that,
that
this
test
is
unmanageable
because
there's
difficulty
in
figuring
out
what
the
denominator
of
the
fraction
is.
do
you
mean
all
people?
is
it
common
among
everyone,
among
taxpayers,
among
taxpayers
with
certain
assets?
would
a
$100,000
trust
have
to
be
treated
differently
than
a
million
dollar
trust?
then
there's
the
question
of
what
do
you
mean
by
"common".
you
suggested
"usually"
or
"sometimes",
"might".
that's
not
clear
either.
and
then
ultimately
there
would
have
to
be
a
trial
somewhere
to
determine
whether
costs
like
this
are
indeed
common
to
whatever
standard
was
articulated.
and
i
think
this
is
why--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--we
think,
your
honor,
that
all
trust
investment
fees
are
distinctive,
that
what
renders
them
distinctive
and
renders
them
fully
deductible
under
the
statute
is
that
they
are
incurred
as
a
result
of
distinctive
fiduciary
obligations.
we
think
the
statute
draws
a
line
between
costs
like
that,
that
are
incurred
as
a
result
of
distinctive
fiduciary
obligation,
which
would
include
all
investment
management
or
advice
fees,
and
by
contrast
costs
that
inhere
in
ownership
of
a
particular
piece
of
property
and
that
any
owner
of
that
property
would
have
to
pay.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
line
is...
is
actually
easier
to
draw
than
your
question
suggests.
i
think
that
fixing
a
roof
on
a
house
might
be
a
cost
that
is
close
to
the
line.
it
may
be
that
some...
for
example,
if
there
were
an
ordinance
in
the
community
that
required
upkeep
of
a
house,
we
think
that
it
would
be
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor.
the
archetypal
example
of
a
cost
that
we
think
congress
intended
and
by
this
language
we
believe
congress
rendered
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor
are
the
costs
of
pass-through
entities
that
might
be
owned
by
the
trust
or
estate.
so,
for
example,
if
there's
an
s
corporation
and
its
management
incurs
an
expense,
that's
reported
back...
because
the
s
corporation
has
no
independent
existence,
that's
reported
back
to
the
owner,
individual
or
trustee,
and
is
reported
as
an
administrative
expense.
it
would
be
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor
from
the
individual
who
incurred
it,
and
it
would
have
been
incurred,
which
is
the
language
of
the
statute,
whether
or
not--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--it
was
held
in
such
trust
or--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--the--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--the
cost
of...
not
distinctive
costs
would
be
the
costs
incurred
by
an
s
corporation
owned
by
the
trustee.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
a
condo
fee,
for
example,
that
simply
essentially
runs
with
the
property.
whoever
owns
this
land
is
going
to
have
to
pay
the
condo
fee.
required
insurance
on
a
vehicle.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
your
honor,
the
costs
are
distinctive
in
the
case
of...
of
those
things
that
are
caused
by
fiduciary
obligation
in
the
sense
that
we
describe
because
that's
how
they
are
caused.
these
costs
are
incurred
without
regard
to
that
fiduciary
obligation.
they're
paid
perhaps
because
of
fiduciary
obligation,
but
they
are
incurred
through
ownership
of
the
property.
and
there
is
a
hint
in
the
text.
if
you
look
at
the
text,
you'll
note
that
costs
that
are
paid
or
incurred
are
deductible.
but
this
asks
about
whether
they
would
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
not
held
in
such
trust
or
estate.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
trustees
cannot
under
law,
and
do
not,
invest
as
individuals
do.
to
begin
with,
they
always
have
to
keep
their
eye
on
current,
future,
contingent
and
remainder
beneficiaries
and
treat
them
with
equal
fairness.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
whenever
a
trustee
hires
an
investment
advisor,
it
is
to
fulfill
this
fiduciary
obligation.
it
is
true
that
there
may
be
a
trustee
who
is
expert
in
this.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
is
actually
quite
a
typical
situation.
the
trustee,
of
course,
knows
his
or
her
obligations.
it's
his
or
her
inability
to
figure
out
how
to
fulfill
them
that--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
unique
obligations.
some
of
these
are
set
out
in
connecticut
statutes.
this
is
in
our
brief
at
page
7
of
the
blue
brief.
there
are
ten
considerations
that
connecticut
law
requires
trustees
to
examine,
including
things
unique
to
trusts:
the
nature
of
the
trust,
its
duration.
the
need
for
liquidity
or
income
versus
capital,
which
is
principal
growth
versus
income,
is
a
uniquely
trustlike
concern.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
it...
i
guess
i
have
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
it
may,
by
happenstance,
be
that
out
of
the
black
box
of
investment
advice
an
individual,
by
happenstance,
gets
the
same
advice
as
a
trust
somewhere;
but
it
would
be
by
happenstance.
the
decisional
process
leading
to
obtaining
the
advice,
incurring
the
cost,
is
distinct
for
trust,
and
indeed
the
advice
they
receive
is
distinct.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
there
is
no
risk
here
of
tax
avoidance
through
creation
of
a
trust.
these
are
non-grantor
trusts.
there
are
substantial
costs
involved
in
creating
them,
but,
among
other
things,
the
top
bracket
of
35
percent--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--no--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
the
commissioner
concedes
at
page
37
of
her
brief
that
there
is
no
substantial
problem
of
income-splitting
through
the
use
of
non-grantor
trusts;
and,
indeed,
throughout--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
that
problem
was
solved
in
section
1
of
26
u.s.
code...
and
this
is
described
at
page
37
of
our
brief...
by
a
compression
of
the
tax
brackets.
the
35
percent
bracket
kicks
in
for
non-grantor
trusts
at
$10,500.
for
an
individual
it
kicks
in
at
$349,000.
as
a
consequence,
there
is
no
incentive
to
move
money
into
a
trust
in
order
to
avoid
taxation
at
a...
at
a
lower
rate.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
a
non-grantor
trust
is
a
real
trust
with
economic
substance.
a
grantor
trust
is
a
trust
in
which
the
grantor
retains
certain
powers,
for
example
it's
revocable,
or
whatever;
and
it's
treated
as...
people
set
them
up
for
estate-planning
purposes,
but--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
but
this
is...
i
guess
this
is
a
term
of
art.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
and,
indeed,
this,
i
think...
and
part
of
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question:
the
problem
of
tax
avoidance
was
dealt
with
in
section
67)(c),
where
entities
like
that
were...
were
said
to
be
treated
as
pass-through
entities
with
no
independent
existence.
but
trusts
and
estates
were
excepted
specifically
from
that
because
of
this
absence
of
risk
of
income-splitting.
and,
indeed,
we
think
that
the...
the
structure
of
the
statute,
not
merely
its
text,
but
the
structure
of
the
statute,
indicates
that
this
is
what
congress
intended.
it's
not...
it's
not
written
the
way
i
would
have
written
it,
your
honor.
but
none
of
the
other
readings
are
textually
even
supportable,
and
this--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--i
wouldn't
say
"regardless
of
the
actual
facts",
your
honor.
but
i
would
say
this:
we
believe
it's
a
categorical
test.
the
first
of
what
the
commissioner
calls
her
textually
plausible
readings
is
literally
a
case-by-case
examination
of
what
would
have
happened
with
this
property
if
it
were
held
by
whomever,
the
beneficiary,
the
grantor,
it's
not
clear
whom.
and,
as
they
described,
congress
can't
have
meant
that.
and
this
would
be
an
imponderable.
how
would
you
ever--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
see
your
point.
and
i
think
this
is
why,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
section
67,
which
treats
pass-through
entities
but
not
trusts
and
estates
as
presenting
a
risk
of
income-splitting;
if
you
look
at
the
code
more
broadly,
which
permits
deductions
by
trusts
and
estates
in
many
circumstances...
section
68
does;
section
154
does...
when
they're
not
permitted
by
individuals
and
especially
when
you
look
at
the
statutory
history
here...
both
houses
of
congress...
well,
this
was
preexisting
law,
i
should
begin
by
saying.
and
then
both
houses
of
congress
passed
in
the
'86
act
this
statute
without
the
second
clause.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
your
honor,
i
guess
my
response
is
severalfold.
to
begin
with,
the
statute
doesn't
ask
what
usually
happens
on
the
outside
or
commonly
or
customarily,
and
indeed
the
commissioner
has
abandoned
this
reading
of
the
statute
precisely
because
it
presents
the
kind
of
imponderables
that
i
was
discussing
with
the
chief
justice:
what
is
usually
done?
do
trusts
of
different
sizes
have
different
rules?
when
a
trust's
assets
come
below
a
certain
point,
what
about
that?
and
most
importantly,
it's
not
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
now,
the
commissioner
concedes
the
distinctive
nature
of
trusts.
and
if
you
look
at
the
examples
that
she
gives
on
page
23
of
her
brief
of
what
it
is
that,
that
is
deductible
in
full,
it's
the
same
as
this:
fiduciary
income
tax
preparation.
well,
people...
many
people
get
income
tax
preparation
for
individual
income
tax
returns.
the
only
difference
is
it's
a
form
1040
or
a
form
1041.
our
case
is
much
further
from
the
line
than
that
because
the
investment
advice
must
be
tailored
to
these,
to
these
rules
under
connecticut
law.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
fiduciary
responsibilities,
your
honor,
we
think
it
would
be
a
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation
to
get...
waste
the
trust
money
paying
for
the
advice
and
to
act
upon
it.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
we
think
that
this
is
intended
as
a
categorical
rule.
and
we
think
that
asking
that
question
is
in
furtherance
of
these
unique
obligations
and
the
prudent
investor
standard,
which
is
not...
this
is
a
new
standard
that's
developed
in
the
united
states
over
the
next
decade
or
so.
it
is
not
merely
what
a
prudent
man
would
do
under
the
old
harvard
college
v.
amory
common
law
test.
investments
that
individuals
can
and
do
invest
in
are
not
open
to
trustees
who
have
a
series
of
rules,
some
of
which
are
counterintuitive,
in
fact,
about
what
they
can
do.
and
these
are
listed
at
pages
7
to
10
of
our
brief.
but
that...
what
you're
describing
we
think
is
investment
advice
and
if
it's
properly
obtained
it
is
distinctive.
i
should
say
also
in
response--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
the
question
is
the
decisional
process
of
the
trustee.
when
the
trustee
calls
up
anyone,
the
income
tax
preparer,
and
says
i'd
like
to
hire
you,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
at
the
moment
of
hiring
it's
for
a
trust.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
he'll
figure
it
out--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--he
will
eventually
come
to
know
that
the
form
is
different,
your
honor,
yes.
but
i
don't
think
the
subjective
knowledge
of
the
person
from
whom
one
gets
the
advice
is
the
question.
the
question,
i
think,
is
textually
directed
to
the
incurment
of
the
cost.
and
i
should
say
also
in
part
of
response
to
part
of
justice
breyer's
question,
the
statutory
history
isn't
merely
the
legislative
history.
it's
the
fact
that,
despite
having
just
the
first
prong
in
it
when
it
was
passed
by
both
houses
of
congress,
there
was
a
floor
amendment
in
the
senate
on
the
day
that
it
passed
the
senate
that
dealt
with
pass-throughs.
the
first
part
of
67(c),
and
the
changes
made
in
the
conference
committee,
again
as
the
commissioner
acknowledges
at
page
37
of
her
brief,
the
changes
made
in
conference,
including
the
addition
of
this,
were
to
deal
precisely
with
how
should
we
deal
with
pass-throughs
and
trusts,
and
trust
ownership
of
pass-throughs--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--yes,
your
honor.
regulations,
however,
have
to
be
both
reasonable--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--okay.
if
they
drew
a
list
of
what
are
the
distinct
trust
costs,
it
would
have
to
include,
if
it
includes
fiduciary,
income
tax
preparation
or,
better
yet,
judicial
accounting,
individual
duties
in
the
case
of
guardianships
and
so
on.
this
is
of
the
same
caliber
and
at
the
same
level
of
generality
we
think
would
have
to
be
covered.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
there's
only
a
proposed
regulation,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
that
because
their
readings
are
not
textually
supportable,
are
unadministratable
and
aren't
what
congress
intended,
that
after
applying
the
ordinary
tools
of
statutory
construction,
there
is
only
one
meaning
that
this
text
can
have.
i'd
like
to
respond
to--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is...
it's
a
little
bit
of
a
moving
target
but
it
does
say
that.
if
those
are
nonexhaustive
lists
and
the
difficulty
of
allocating
these
costs
of
attributing
them
to
one
thing
or
another,
putting
in
place
systems
that
trustees
that
charge
unitary
fees,
which
is
what
corporate
trustees
do,
is
enormous.
and
some
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
comments,
the
public
comments
to
the
regulation,
some
excerpts
of
which
are
included
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief.
but
this
is
not
a
simple
test.
and
indeed,
the
commissioner
essentially
concedes
that,
saying
that
she
would
need
to
have
safe
harbors
or
some
other
unprincipled
line
because
of
the
difficulty.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
trust
investment
advice
is
always
distinct
from
the
investment
advice
that's
given
to
individuals,
both
because
of
the
demanding
legal
obligations
specifying
certain
factors
that
have
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
trustee
in
investing
and
because
of
the
risk
of
personal
liability.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at,
at
our
brief,
at
pages
7
through
10,
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
specific
legal
factors
that
are
codified
in
connecticut
law
in
the
uniform
prudent
investor
act,
which
does
not,
as
the
commissioner
suggested,
require
people
to
invest
as
a
prudent
individual,
but
it's
a
different
standard.
so,
for
example,
safe
investments,
conservative
investments
are
not
permitted
any
more
in
many
circumstances
to
trustees
when
an
individual
could
well
engage
in
that
kind
of
investment.
investment
in
areas
that
the
trustee
is
familiar
with
is
not
adequate
to
meet
this
obligation.
so
the
advice
really
is
tailored
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
the
trust
instrument
in
every
case
to
the
trust.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
no
trust,
your
honor,
has
exactly
the
same
circumstances
as
a
trust,
because
trusts
always
have,
by
definition,
more
than
one
beneficiary.
there
is
always
a
remainder
beneficiary,
at
least.
ordinarily
there
will
be--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--the
decision
process
for
the
investments
will
be
different
in
the
case
of
a
trustee,
though,
than
for
an
individual.
and
a
trust,
of
course,
could
be
multigenerational.
this
trust
will
probably
last
for
about
a
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
it
was
initially
adopted.
i
should
also
say--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--both.
the
decision...
the
decision
to
hire
the
investment
advisor
is
an
exercise
of
fiduciary
judgment
taking
into
account
these...
these
factors;
and
the
advice
that
you're
paying
for
is
a
different
service
that's
tailored
to
the
trust.
this,
therefore...
the
commissioner
acknowledges
that...
that
the...
that
trusts
are
distinct.
but...
but
resists
the...
the
analogy
between,
for
example,
fiduciary
income
tax
returns
or
judicial
accountings
and
other
tax
returns.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
believe,
your
honor,
there
may
be
specific
fees
for
trust
investments
that
are
offered
by
firms
that...
that
provide
investment
advice.
whether
there
are
specific
advisors
who
will
take
only
fiduciary
clients,
i
don't--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--well,
i
think
that
this
actually
points
out,
justice
stevens,
part
of
the
problem
with
the
commissioner's
position,
which
is
it
relies
on
labels.
the
commissioner
has
said
it's
a
common--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
--not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
my
sense
is
that
an
income
tax
preparer
will
be
willing
to
prepare
an
income
tax
return
for
a
fiduciary
or
an
individual.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
