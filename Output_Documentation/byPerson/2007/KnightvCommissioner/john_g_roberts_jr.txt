chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
06-1286,
michael
knight,
trustee,
v.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
rubin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
agree
that
as
a
taxpayer
seeking
an
exception
to
a
general
rule,
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
can't
take...
i
guess
it's
not
judicial
notice,
but
we
can't
assume
that
individual
investors
with
several
million
dollars
of
liquid
assets
might
hire
investment
advisors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
they
usually
hire
investment
advisors?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
you'd
concede,
wouldn't
you,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
all
of
the
investment
advice
that
you
receive
but
perhaps
only
that
that
is
related
to
the
trust
status?
in
other
words,
if
your
investment
advisor
charges
you
$50,000
and,
you
know,
10,000
of
it
is
unique
to
the
trust,
but
40,000
is
the
same
sort
of
advice
he'd
give
an
individual,
you'd
only
be
able
to
get
the
10,000
outside
of
the
2
percent
limit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
don't
have
to
hire
investment
advisors.
there
is
a
standard
that
they
may
think
they
can
meet
on
their
own.
they
may...
you
know,
it
may
be
an
investment
advisor
that
is
the
trustee.
he
doesn't
have
to
hire
somebody
else.
so
it's
not
something
that
necessarily
inheres
in
the
nature
of
the
trust.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why...
if
i
could
pause
you
on
that,
why
is
that
the
case?
let's
say
it's
a...
the
trustee
understands
perfectly
his
obligations
under
the
law.
let's
just
say
he
is
supposed
to
preserve
capital
and
invest
conservatively,
but
he
wants
advice
on
which
is
the
best
conservative
investment.
you
know,
is
it
railroads
or
is
it
utilities?
and
that's
the
investment
advice
he
seeks...
just
that.
he
says:
i
know
how
i'm
supposed
to
invest
as
a
fiduciary,
but
there
are
options
in
there,
and
i
just
want
advice
on
the
options.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
just
like
an
individual
investor?
if
you
have
an
individual
investor
with
$10
million
in
liquid
assets,
he
or
she
might
know
what
he
wants
to
do,
either
capital
appreciation
or
preservation,
you
know,
whatever
the
option
is,
but
just
wants
some
advice
on
how
best
to
go
about
that.
that
sounds
exactly
like
the
trustee
in
our
hypothetical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
you
see,
that's
my
difficulty
with
your
position.
it's
not
uniquely
trust
because
you
certainly
have
individuals
who
may
want
income
rather
than
capital
appreciation
or,
you
know,
preservation
of
capital.
they
may
have
exactly
the
same
objectives
as
a
trustee.
it's
not
unique
to
the
trust.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
well,
then
let's
take
that.
let's
suppose
that
the
trustee
goes
to
an
investment
advisor,
doesn't
tell
him
that
he
is
a
trustee,
just
says,
i
need
to
know,
i
can't
decide,
should
i
invest
in
union
pacific
or
csx?
i'm
going
to
invest
in
a
railroad;
which
one
do
you
like
better?
he
doesn't
tell
him
he's
a
trustee,
gets
some
advice
and
gets
a
bill.
is
that
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor,
because
presumably
the
advice
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
fiduciary
responsibilities?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
it's
a
reasonable...
let's
say
a
railroad
stock
is
a
reasonable
investment
for
a
trust.
he
just
wants
to
know
which
one
is
the
best
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
it
be
distinctive
if
the
advisor
doesn't
even
know
that
the
person's
a
trustee?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
it's
filled
out--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he
knows
it's
on
form
1041
rather
than
1040.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
didn't
think
much
of
this
argument
before
the
second
circuit
adopted
it,
did
you?
you
didn't
argue
this
before
the
court
of
appeals?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
have
a
fallback
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
might
be
a
good
time
to
fall
back.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
does
your
customary
or
commonly
incurred
test
work?
let's
say
you
have
two
trusts,
one
$10
million,
the
other
10,000.
i
think
an
individual
with
$10
million
might
well
seek
investment
advice,
but
an
individual
with
only
10,000
might
decide
it's
not
worth
it.
would
you
have
a
different
application
of
the
2
percent
rule
for
those
two
trusts?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
many...
how
many
individuals
do
you
need?
let's
say
it's
$3
million
in
the
trust,
and
we
think
maybe
60
percent
of
people
would
hire
an
investment
advisor;
40
percent
would
think
they
can
do
just
as
well
on
their
own.
is
that
customarily
incurred
by
individuals?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
answer
to
both
questions
is
"might
well
be",
and
that's
a
fairly
vague
line
when
it
comes
to
taxes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or,
even
worse,
advisors
are
going
to
break
themselves
up
into
different
advisors.
there's
going
to
be
somebody
who
says
i'm
a
fiduciary
advisor
whenever
a
trustee
calls,
but,
i'm
a
normal
advisor,
when
it's
an
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
your
best
case
for
that
proposition?
your
colleague
resisted
the
notion
that
he
had
the
burden
and
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
thought
that
rule
applied
to
the
applicability
of
individual
exemptions.
here
we
have
a
different
question.
it's
how
to
read
an
exception
to
the
general
rule.
do
you
have
a
case
for
a
proposition
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
in
those
cases?
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
but
it
didn't
have
a
case
cite
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
get
a
bill
from
the
investor
advisor,
and
it's
$50,000
and
it's
broken
up,
30,000
is
general
stock
picking
advice,
and
20
percent
is
specialized
fiduciary
advice?
in
other
words,
they
figure
out
what
good
stocks
are
they
pushing
these
days
and
they
go
down
and
say,
well,
you're
a
trustee,
you
can't
buy
this
you
can't
buy
that.
you
would...
would
you
agree
that
the
$20,000
is
not
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor
but
the
30,000
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
rubin,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
could
also
be
tailored
to
an
individual
with
particular
circumstances
that
are
similar
to
that
of
the
trust.
so
an
individual
could
incur
it.
an
individual
with
the
same
amount
of
money
involved
probably
would
incur
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
an
individual
might
have
more
than
one
child
he
wants
to
provide
for
and
as
far
as
a
remainder,
there
may
be
more
than
one
grandchild.
it
could
be
exactly
the
same...
an
individual
could
have
exactly
the
same
objectives
as
a
trustee.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
rubin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
today
in
case
06-1286,
knight
versus
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
the
trustee
of
a
trust
holding
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
pepperidge
farm
company
to
campbell
soup.
the
trustee
had
hired
an
investment
advisor
to
manage
the
trust
assets.
on
its
tax
return
for
the
year
2000,
the
trust
claimed
a
full
deduction
for
the
fees
it
paid
the
investment
advisor.
now,
under
the
tax
code,
individuals
may
claim
deductions
for
certain
items,
including
investment
advisory
fees
on
their
tax
returns,
but
only
to
the
extent
those
deductions
exceed
2%
of
their
adjusted
gross
income.
tax
lawyers
call
this
the
2%
floor.
the
code
generally
treats
deductions
claimed
by
trust
the
same
way
it
treats
those
claimed
by
individuals
as
subject
to
this
2%
floor,
but
there
is
an
exception
and
it
is
that
exception
that
gives
rise
to
this
case.
if
a
cost
incurred
by
a
trust
"would
not
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
held
by
an
individual"
rather
than
in
trust,
the
expense
is
not
subject
to
the
2%
floor,
but
is
fully
deductible.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
decided
in
this
case
that
investment
advisory
fees
incurred
by
a
trust
are
subject
to
the
2%
floor
because
the
only
costs
that
are
fully
deductible
are
those
that
could
not
be
incurred
by
individuals.
this
reading
of
the
statute
is
wrong.
the
statute
asks
whether
the
cost
would
have
been
incurred,
not
whether
they
could
have
been.
if
congress
had
intended
the
court
of
appeals’
reading,
it
easily
could
have
replaced
would
with
could
and
presumably
would
have.
[laughter]
the
trustee
argues
that
the
exception
to
the
2%
floor
applies
whenever
a
trust
incurs
an
expense
because
the
property
is
subject
--
because
–
because
the
subject
property
is
held
in
trust.
but
on
this
view,
every
trust
expense
would
be
fully
deductible
allowing
the
exception
to
swallow
the
rule.
more
to
the
point,
the
statute
does
not
ask
whether
a
particular
cost
is
incurred
because
property
is
held
in
trust,
rather,
it
asks
what
would
happen
if
the
property
were
not
held
in
trust.
other
lower
courts
have
held
--
have
read
the
statute
to
ask
whether
a
particular
cost
would
commonly
be
incurred
if
the
trust
property
were
held
by
an
individual
rather
than
by
a
trust.
now
while
we
found
the
second
circuit's
approach
too
restrictive
and
petitioner's
approach
too
broad,
we
find
this
approach
to
be
just
right.
in
asking
whether
a
particular
cost
would
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
held
by
an
individual,
the
statute
asks
us
to
make
a
prediction
about
what
would
happen
if
a
fact
were
changed.
when
you
make
a
prediction
in
such
a
case,
you
try
to
figure
out
what
would
commonly
or
usually
happen.
it
is
certainly
common
for
individuals
to
incur
investment
advisory
fees
and
so
the
similar
fees
incurred
by
the
trust
are
subject
to
the
2%
floor.
now,
we
recognize
that
our
test
may
not
be
the
easiest
to
apply
in
other
cases,
but
it
is
the
test
that
the
statute
requires.
and
we
have
no
authority
to
amend
statutes
simply
because
we
might
find
an
alternative,
easier
–
easier
to
apply.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
but
for
reasons
different
from
those
given
by
that
court.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
