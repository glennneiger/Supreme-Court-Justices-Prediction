justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
really
see
that
line.
i
mean,
let's...
let's
take,
you
know,
fixing
the
roof
on
a
house
that's
in
the
trust.
aren't
there
distinctive
trustee
obligations
with
respect
to
preservation
of
property,
just
as
there
are
with
respect
to
preservation
of
financial
assets?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
a
very
hard
line
to
draw.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
still--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
still
trying
to
get
back
to
my
original
question.
i...
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
think
is
not
an
expense
that's
distinctive
to...
to
a
trust,
other
than
fixing
the
roof,
because
you
haven't
persuaded
me
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
fixing
a
roof
is
fixing
a
roof.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
there
a
trustee
obligation
to
pay
all...
all
expenses
which
if
not
paid
will...
would
cause
a
depletion
of
the
assets?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
say
that
that's
a
trustee
response...
i
mean,
if
the
criterion
is
he
paid
this
money
only
to
discharge
an
obligation
as
a
trustee,
it
seems
to
me
all
of
his
expenses
are
in
that
category,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
s
corporations
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
"non-grantor
trusts".
what
is
a
"non-grantor
trust"?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
trust
has
a
grantor,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
a
"non-grantor
trust"--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
a
trust
without
any
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
think
that
the
only
instances
where
the
expense
would
not
have
occurred
are
those
instances
where
it
could
not
have
occurred?
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
self-evident.
i
mean,
i
understand
why
you
do
it,
so
that
can
you
have
a
nice
clear
line,
which
i
am
all
for.
but
the
line
given
by
your
colleague
is
just
as
clear.
i
don't
know
why
i
should
accept
yours
when...
i
mean,
"would"
just
does
not
mean
"could".
i
mean,
would
have,
could
have,
should
have,
it's...
they're
different
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
a
context
where...
where...
other
than
this
statute,
where
in
common
parlance
people
use
"would"
to
mean
"could".
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
mean
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
that
could
not
be
done
of
course
would
not
be
done.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the...
that
the
two
words
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
true
that
one
is
included
within
the
other,
but
they
don't
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
could
not
happen
would
not
happen,
of
course.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that...
the
two
concepts
are
not
the
same.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
have
the
same
problem.
you
know,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
entirely
reasonable
to
say
only
a
trustee
can
seek
investment
advice
concerning
what
he
should
do
to
fulfill
his
responsibilities
under
the
trust.
only
a
trustee
can
do
that.
a
private
individual
might
seek
investment
advice
as
to
how
he
could
maximize
the
income
or...
or
the
growth
of
the
funds
that
he
has,
but
only...
only
a
trustee
seeks
advice
as
to
how
he
can
fulfill
his
responsibilities
under
the
trust.
and
you
could
say
that's
distinctive.
no
individual
would
do
that
because
he's
not
a
trustee.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may...
it
may
well
be
the
same
advice,
but
in...
but
in
one
case
it
is...
it
is
advice
sought
by
and
given
to
a
trustee,
a
unique
kind
of
advice.
in...
in
substance,
it
may
turn
out
to
be
the
same;
but
it's
not
the
same
advice
you're
giving
to
a
private
individual.
you're
saying
here's
the
trust
instrument
and
here
are
the
objects
to
be
achieved
by
the
trust
instrument
and
this
is
the...
the
advice
that
will
best
do
that.
that
doesn't
happen
with
an
individual.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
really
spice
up
advice
that
way?
you
ask
the
advisor,
say,
which...
what
percentage
of
your
advice
was
the
advice
that
went
to
maximizing
total
return
and
what
percentage
went
to
this
other
thing?
i
mean,
gee,
i
don't
want
to
get
courts
into
trying
to
figure
that
out,
or
private
individuals
or
financial
advisors
in
trying
to
figure
that
out.
that's
just
a
crazy
way
to
run
a
tax
system,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
all
advice.
that's
just
some
of
the
advice,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
about
the
rest
of
it?
how
do
you
slice
up,
you
know...
now,
investment
advisor,
tell
me
what
percentage
of
your
advice
went
to
the
total
return
and
what
percentage
went
to
other
things.
i
don't
think
the
investment
advisor
is
going
to
be
able
to
tell
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
whatever
line
you...
you
pick,
i
guarantee
you,
trusts
are
going
to
break
themselves
up
into
mini-trusts
that
fall
under
the
line.
i
mean
people
aren't
stupid.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
"would
not
have
occurred"
is
pretty
good--
justice
antonin
scalia
--actually.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
cost
of
the
advice?
what
percentage
of
the
costs
incurred
by
a
trust
do
you
think
the
investment
advice
consists
of?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
main
thing
a
trustee
ordinarily
does,
at
least
if
he
is
a
trustee
of
just
cash,
is
to
invest
it.
it
seems
to
me
his
major
expense
must
be
getting
financial
advice,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
imagine
something
else.
guess.
what
other,
what
other
expense
could
even
approximate
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
my
follow-up
is,
is
there
any...
i
don't
care
about
legislative
history
but
some
of
my
colleagues
do.
is
there
any...
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
thought
it
was,
it
was
whacking
trusts
with
this
immense
new
tax
with
respect
to
their
major
expenditure?
i
expect
it
must
be
their
major
expenditure.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
dog
didn't
bark.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
know
a
trust
is
sort
of
like
a
business.
and
deductions
that
an
individual
could
not
take
if
he
were
not
in
a
business
are
perfectly
okay
for
a
business.
and
i
don't
know
why
trusts
wouldn't
be
treated
the
same
way.
a
trust
has
to
get
investment
advice.
true?
when
it's...
when
it's
an
individual
getting
it,
you
wouldn't
allow
a
deduction,
but
a
trust
is
different.
and
unless
congress
is
clearer
than
this
statute,
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
no
individual
would
get
trust
investment
advice.
only
a
trust
can
get
trust
investment
advice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
individual
who
wanted
to
maximize
income,
for
example,
if
the
trustee
has
to
maximize
income
for
some
of
the
life
beneficiaries
or
something,
an
individual
could
seek
that
same
advice
if
he
wanted
that
particular
result
from
the
investment,
couldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
that.
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be,
you
know,
the
advisor
had
to
figure
out
we
need
so
much
for
the,
for
the
remainder
man
and
so
much
for
the
life
beneficiaries
and
so
forth.
you
don't
think
that
would
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rubin,
is
it
the
advice
that's
different
or
is
it...
is
it
the
inquiry
that's
different.
