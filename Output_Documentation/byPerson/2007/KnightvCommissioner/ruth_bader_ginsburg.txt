mr.
rubin,
you
were
not
willing
to
agree
with
the
chief
when
he
said:
well,
maybe
there
are
some
investment
expenses
that
are
special
because
this
is
a
trust.
but
there
must
be
some
that
any
investor
would
incur.
but
you
say
it's
got
to
be
all
one
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
true?
and
i'm
looking
at
testimony
given
by
j.
roger
mintz
in
1986
when
this
measure
was
before
congress,
and
in
that
written
testimony
is
the
statement:
"first,
the
treatment
of
trusts
as
separate
taxpayers
with
a
separate,
graduated
rate
schedule
can
cause
income
to
be
taxed
at
a
rate
lower
than
if
the
grantor
had
retained
direct
ownership
of
the
trust
assets
or
given
the
assets
outright
to
the
beneficiaries.
"
so
apparently
the
treasury
was
telling
the
congress
that
there
is
a
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
grantor
trust
would
be
one
of
those
pass-throughs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
not
administerable?
whether
you
think
it's
a
faithful
rendition
of
the
statute
is
one
thing,
but
this
is
exactly
what
justice
breyer
was
talking
about.
it
says
these
are
the
things
that
are
special
to
the
trust,
and
then
these
are
the
things
that
are
not.
that's
what
the
proposed
reg
does,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wasn't
narrow
in
the
beginning,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
somewhat
of
a
mystery,
the
wording
of
that
clause.
and
since
it
came
in
at
the
very
last
minute,
isn't
it
appropriate
to
give
it
a
limited
reading,
rather
than,
in
your
suggestion,
that
this
provision
that
up
until
the
very
end
read
just
administration,
"costs
paid
or
incurred
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estate
or
trust.
"
period?
and
then
there
was
this
add-on.
why
should
we
give
that
an
expansive
meaning?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
that
limitation?
why
wouldn't
it
say
just
"investment
advice",
but
it's...
investing
for
total
return
is
more
limited?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
say
it's
one
or
the
other.
so
it's
not
so
sure,
right?
it's
sure
about
advice
on
investing
for
total
return.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
the
regulation,
the
proposed
regulation,
doesn't
answer
this
case
of
investment
advice
in
general
as
opposed
to
advice
on
investing
for
total
return.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
certainly
weren't
sure
about
it
when
they
drafted
this
regulation,
proposed
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
other
categories,
they
express
no
such
limitation.
custody
or
management
of
property,
not
qualified.
and
they...
but
when
you
get
to
investing,
it
has
that
total
return.
everything
else
has
got
maintenance,
repair,
insurance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
we
saying,
as
a
question
of
law,
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof?
if
it
isn't
a
question
of
proof,
it
isn't
a
question
of
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
must
be
one.
the
service
must
think
this
is
one
because
it
was
certain
about
the
tax
return.
it
says
tax
return
that
doesn't
get
the
subject
to
the
2
percent
but
only
this
kind
of
investment
advice
for
total
return.
so
that
the
service
didn't
see
this
as
a
clear
and
certain
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
far
as
a
tax
return,
are
there
accountants
this
specialize
in
trust
tax
returns
as
opposed
to
individual
or
corporate
returns?
