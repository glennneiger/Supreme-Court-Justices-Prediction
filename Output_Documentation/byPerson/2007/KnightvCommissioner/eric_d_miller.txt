mr.
eric
d.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
67(e)
creates
a
narrow
exception
to
the
2
percent
floor
for
costs
which
would
not
have
not
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
not
held
in
trust.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
second
clause
was
added
in
a
floor
amendment.
initially
congress
had
drafted
just
the
"which
are
paid"...
"which
are
incurred
or
paid
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
the
estate
or
trust.
"
then
the
second
clause
was
added.
and
that
clause
demands
that
the
costs
would
not
have
been
incurred
if
the
property
were
not
held--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think,
regardless
of
the
timing,
your
honor,
congress
chose
to
enact
it
and
that
choice
has
to
be
given
effect.
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
way
that
the
section
as
a
whole
is
set
up,
67(e),
the
first
introductory
clause
creates
the
general
principle
that
for
purposes
of
this
section
the
adjusted
gross
income
of
an
estate
shall
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
in
the
case
of
an
individual,
except
that,
and
then
there
is
clause
one.
so
in
the
context
of
this
section,
we
have
a
general
rule
and
then
an
exception.
and
that
ought
to
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
usual
principle
that
exceptions,
particularly
ambiguous
exceptions,
should
not
be
construed
so
as
to
swallow
up
the
entirety
of
the
rule,
which
is
essentially
what
petitioner's
interpretation
would
do.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
they
are...
they're
certainly
different
words.
we're
not
suggesting
that
they
are
synonyms.
but
we
are
suggesting
that
there
are
contexts
in
which
the
word
"would"
can
carry
the
same
meaning
that
is
also
expressed
through
the
word
"could".
mr.
eric
d.
miller
another
example
would
be
if
i
were
to
say
that
that
glass
would
not
hold
more
than
8
ounces
of
water,
that
would
mean
that
it
could
not
hold
more
than
8
ounces
of
water.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--would...
i
think
that
the
unadorned
use
of
the
word
"would"
here--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think,
when...
when
you
have
the
word
"would",
as
we
have
in
this
statute,
that's
not
qualified
in
any
way,
it's
ambiguous
in
the
sense
that
it
can
mean
definitely
would
not
have
been
incurred,
probably
would
not
have
been
incurred,
customarily,
ordinarily
would
not
have
been
incurred,
which
is
the
meaning--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--we
did
not
argue
it
before--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
that...
that's
right.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
right.
and
certainly
the
statute
also
admits
of
the
reading
given
to
it
by
the
fourth
and
federal
circuits,
which
is
that
"would
not
have
been
incurred"
means
customarily
or
ordinarily
would
not
have
been
incurred
by
individuals.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i...
i
think
that
that
raises
the
question
of
what
is
the
relevant
comparison
group
for...
for
individuals
outside
of
the
trust
side
of
it.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
and...
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
relevant
comparison
is
individuals
with...
with
similar
assets,
right,
because
it's
in
the
absence
of
a
trust,
not
if
the
property
did
not
exist.
so
you
have
to
look
at
an
individual
who
held
those
assets
outright,
and
an
individual
with
those
assets
trying
to
achieve
those
goals
might
well
seek
investment
advice.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the...
the
difference
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--what--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it's
more
expensive
because
it's
an
additional
cost.
if
an
individual
were
to
hold
the
property
outright,
he
or
she
would
simply
put
the
income
from
that
property
on
his
own
1040.
if
in
addition
there
is
a
trust,
then
the
trust
has
to
fill
out
a
1041,
the
trust
also
has
to
prepare
form
k-1s
and
send
them
out
both
to
the
beneficiaries
and
to
the
irs,
showing
the
beneficiaries'
share
of
the
trust
income,
and
then
the
individual
still
has
to
file
a
1040.
so
the
existence
of
the
trust
has
created
this
whole
additional
set
of
filing
and
reporting
obligations.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
with
respect
to
the
tax
return,
it's
not
that
it's
a
fiduciary
tax
return
as
opposed
to
an
individual
tax
return;
it's
that
it's
an
extra
tax
return
that
has
to
be
filed.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right,
but
if
the
beneficiary--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that's
the
only...
but
in
that...
in
the
system
of
the
beneficiary
and
the
fiduciary
there
are
two
tax
returns
that
have
to
be
filed,
whereas--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
that...
that's
an
extra
obligation
that
would
not
have
been
incurred
in
the
absence
of
the
trust.
and
i
think,
turning
to
the
case
of
investment
advice,
i
think
there
is
really
no
level
of
generality
or
particularity
at
which
one
can
look
at
investment
advice
such
that
there
is
anything
unique
about
trust
investment
advice.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it's
not
a
difference,
because
if
the
individual
invests
poorly
he'll
lose
money.
and
if
the...
and
he'll
lose
his
own
money.
if
the
fiduciary
invests
poorly
he
may
get
sued
and
the
measure
of
damages
in
that
suit
will
be
the
amount
of
money
he
lost.
so
they're
both
facing
the
possibility
of
losing.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
the...
the
standard
of
conduct
that
is
supposed
to
govern
the
fiduciary
is
the
prudent
investor
rule,
which
looks
at
what
a
reasonable
prudent
individual
would
do
in
managing
his
own
money
so
i
think
that--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--but
there's
no
distinction
in
that
case
in
the...
in
the
fee
that's
charged
or
in
the
advice
that's
given
by
the
investment
advisor.
in
either
case
somebody
goes
to
the
advisor
and
says,
i
have
the
following
goals
that
i
want
to
achieve
with
this
money.
it
may
be
my
money;
it
may
be
a
trust's
money.
and
the
advisor
thinks
about
those
goals
and
comes
up
with...
with
investment
advice.
and
those
goals--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
mean,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
word
"trust"
is
in
there,
i
think
the
substance
of
the
interaction
with
the
investment
advisor
is
exactly
the
same.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
subparagraph
c
has
two
lists,
both
of
which
are
nonexclusive:
a
list
of
items
that
are
unique
to
trusts
and
a
list
of
items
that
are
not
unique
to
trusts.
in
the
list
of
items
that
are
not
unique
to
trusts
is
investing
for
total
return.
there
is
no
type
of
investment
advice--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
perhaps
because
that's
most
obviously
the
type
of
advice
that
is
not
unique
to
trusts.
but
the...
the
proposed
regulation
does
not
identify
any
kind
of
advice
that
is
unique
to
trusts.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
and--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--you're
right
that
the
regulation
in
terms
of
the
enumeration
in
subsection
(b)
is
silent
on
the
question
of
other
types
of--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
that's
right,
and
that's
why
i
think
that
the...
despite
the
fact
that
investing
for
total
return
is
the
only
example
given
in
the
list,
which,
again,
is
described
as
not
exclusive.
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
proposed
regulation
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
the
best
reading
of
the
proposed
regulation,
and
perhaps
the
service
may
well
clarify
this
during
the
rule-making
process,
is
that
all
advice
is
not
unique
to
trusts
because
there's
no
type
of
advice
that
a
trustee
could
seek
that
an
individual
could
not--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
it
is...
it's
just
a
proposal,
again,
and
i
think
they
picked
what's
perhaps
the
most
obvious.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
and
there's
also
a
fairly
extensive
list
of
nonexclusive...
of
nonunique
products
or
services,
and
that
does
not
include
any
other
type
of
investment
advice.
so
i
think
what
one
can
draw
the
opposite
inference
from
that
list,
but
in
any
event,
that's
something
that
could
be
clarified
in
the
rule-making
process.
returning
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
if
the
test
is
whether...
whether
the
individuals
would
have...
would
commonly
ordinarily
incur
that
cost,
i
think
one
might
well
look
at
that
because
the
comparison
would
be
individuals
with
similar
assets,
and,
as
your
honor
knows,
there
might
be
a
difference
depending
on
the
size.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
it
might
well
be
enough
that...
for
something
that
the
service
could
clarify
through--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
the
difficulty
in
applying
that
test
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
suggest
that
the
categorical...
the
more
categorical
approach,
which
we
think
is
also
a
permissible
reading
of
the
statute,
is
the
preferable
one.
but,
in
either
event,
if
the
test
is
customarily
or
ordinarily
incurred,
it
was
petitioner's
obligation
in
the
tax
court
to
show
that
they
qualified
for
the
exemption
from
the
2
percent
floor.
and
so
it
would
be
petitioner's
burden
to
show
that
this
is
a
cost
not
that's
customarily
or
ordinarily
incurred
by
individuals.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it's
not
a
case,
but
it's
the
rule.
tax
court
rule
142
places
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
taxpayer.
petitioner
sites--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
we
don't
have
a
case,
but
the
rule
is
unqualified
in
terms
of
its
applicability.
it
doesn't
say
only
on
particular
issues.
and
the
case
that
petitioner
cites
is
united
states
against
janis,
which
is
about
a
"naked"
assessment,
which
is
far
removed
from
what
we
have
here.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
a
"naked"
assessment
is--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--no.
i
was
referring
to
questions
of
fact.
i
understood
the
question
to
be
if
the
legal
test
turns
on
the
factual
question
of
what
is
it,
what
is
customary
or
ordinary
for
individuals
to
incur,
then
on
that
fact,
that
would
be
a
factual
issue.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
if
that
is
the
test,
then
it's
very
easy
to
apply
to
the
case
of
investment
advice,
because
we
know
that
the
trustee's
obligation
is
to
act
as
a
reasonable
and
prudent
individual
would.
and
so
we
know
that
if...
to
the
extent
that
the
trustee
seeks
investment
advice
in
pursuance
of
that
obligation--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--that
would--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
you're
suggesting
that
the
service
could
be...
could
clarify
the
statute
through
the
use
of
regulations,
we
certainly
agree
with
that.
the
service
has
the
ability
to
resolve
some
of
the
ambiguities.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
the...
the
formulation
that
the
service
has
proposed
of
course
is
to
look
at
costs
that
are
unique
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
"ordinarily"
or
"customarily"
is
also
a
permissible
interpretation
of--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
they
are
actually
very
similar
inquiries,
because
we
expect
that
the
reasonable
person
is
the
ordinary
person.
so
i
think
in
practice,
those
formulations
get
you
to
the--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--well,
ordinary
and
necessary
under...
i
mean
here
we
are
talking
about...
as
mr.
rubin
said,
it's
under
212.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
it's
not
in
connection
with
a
trade
or
business.
ordinary
and
necessary
in
that
context
means
simply
that
it's
a
legitimately
connected
to
the
production
of
income.
that's
a
requirement
for
it
to
be
deductible
at
all.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
i
think
what
the
service
is
trying
to
do
in
the
proposed
regulation
and
what
we
have
suggested
is
appropriate
is
simply
a
common
sense
practical
approach
to
that.
and
there
may
be
some
difficult
cases
at
the
margin.
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
service
will
try
to--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--again,
i
think
what
the
service
was
doing
there
was
picking
out
just
the
most
obvious
example.
but
there
simply
is
no
such
thing
as
fiduciary
investment
advice
that
is
distinct
from--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
think
what
we
have
suggested
is
there
are
two...
there
are
a
couple
of
possible
readings
of
the
statute
based
on
the
ambiguity
in
the
word
"would".
and
in
the
absence
of
a
regulation,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
service's
position
is
entitled
to
deference
under
chevron.
but
i
think
some
deference
to
the
consistent
position
of
the
service
since
the
statute
was
enacted
that
the
investment
advice
be
subject
to
the
2
percent
floor.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
they
will...
they
will
be
deductible
but
they
will
be
subject
to
the
floor.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
under...
i
mean,
if
the
test
were
customarily
or
ordinarily,
it
might
be
the
case
that
a
trust
could
show
that
given
the
nature
of
the
assets
in
it,
if
it
were--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--it's
not...
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it's
at
the
level
of
that
particular
advice.
the
question
would
be--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
the
service--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--one--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--to
take
your
second
question
first,
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
specifically
what
congress's
objective
was
in
section
67(e).
mr.
eric
d.
miller
but
i
think...
but
i
think
what
one
can
infer
from
legislative
history
of
the
'86
act
and
more
broadly
and
from
the
text
of
the
statute
is
that
congress
wanted
property
to
be
treated
the
same,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
held
by
an
individual
outright
or
held
by
a
trust.
so
if
an
individual
would
incur
certain
costs
if
he
held
the
property
outright,
those
costs
shouldn't
be
able
to
escape
the
2
percent
floor
simply
because
the
property
is
placed
into
a
trust.
but
if
the
trust...
the
existence
of
the
trust
relationship
creates
some
new
or
additional
costs
that
would
not
have
existed
otherwise,
then
those
are
not
subjected
to
the
2
percent
clause.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
well,
individuals
could
get...
could
and
do
get
investment
advice
that
is
no
different
in
substance
from
the
advice
the
trust
might
get.
and
a
trustee
might
decide
that
he
didn't
need
investment
advice
if
the
trustee
is
financially
sophisticated
and
doesn't
need
an
advisor.
to
go--
mr.
eric
d.
miller
--yes.
as
we
acknowledged
in
our
brief,
if
the
advisor...
or
another
example
would
be
if
the
advisor
imposed
some
extra
charge
on
the
fiduciary
accounts
for
whatever
reason,
that
would
be
an
expense
that
an
individual
going
to
that
same
advisor
could
not
incur
or
ordinarily
would
not
incur.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
that's
right.
i
understood
the
question
to
refer
to
the
case
where
the
advisor
charges
some
extra
fee
because
the
client
is
a
trust.
mr.
eric
d.
miller
no.
it
wouldn't
be.
thank
you.
