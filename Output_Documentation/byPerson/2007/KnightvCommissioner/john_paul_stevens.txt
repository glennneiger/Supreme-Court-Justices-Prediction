may
i
ask
this
sort
of
elementary
question,
and
it
may
reveal
my
stupidity.
but
actually
sometimes
these
costs
are
incurred
by
individuals,
and
sometimes
they're
not.
but...
so
that
you
would
normally
think
there's
going
to
be
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
what
happened
in
the
particular
case.
but
do
i
understand
correctly
that
both
you
and
the
government
take
the
position
that
we
should
apply
the
same
rule
across
the
board
regardless
of
the
actual
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
most
normal
reading
of
the
language,
it's
a
case-by-case
test.
it
seems
to
me
the...
probably
the
most
unwise
reading,
also.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
adversary?
whether
you
use
the
term
"could"
or
"customarily"
or
whatever
you're
formulating,
the
bottom
line,
as
i
understand
your
position,
is
that
these
costs
will
never
be
deductible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
will
never...
you
would
not
say
some
trusts
yes,
and
some
trusts
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
have
to
have
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
the
facts
as
to
whether
the
particular
advice
would
have
been
sought,
whether
the
advice
was
by
a
trustee
or
by
an
individual?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rubin,
is
there
a
subcategory
of
investment
advisors
who
hold
themselves
out
to
be
fiduciary
investment
advisors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
even
those
who
advertise
themselves
as
specialists
in
fiduciary
advice?
i
never
heard
of
them.
maybe
there
are.
