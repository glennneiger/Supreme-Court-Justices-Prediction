justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
read
the
legislative
history,
which
shows
to
me,
anyway,
precisely
no
light
whatsoever.
it's...
the
only
relevant
sentence,
which
is
the
third
sentence,
simply
repeats
the
statute.
and,
therefore,
i
thought
that
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
is
say,
treat
trusts
like
individuals,
except
in
respect
to
special
expenses.
what
are
special
expenses?
those
that
are
related
to
the
trust
and
that
an
individual
wouldn't
have
occurred...
incurred.
i
can't
say
it
much
clearly
than
that.
but
i
have
an
absolutely
clear
idea
what
it
means.
to
me
it
means
that
if
this
is
an
expense
that
the
trust
is
saying
is
special,
i
would
say,
would
a
reasonable
person
who
did
not
hold
these
assets
in
trust,
would
such
a
person
be
likely
to
make
that
kind
of
expenditure?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
well,
then
i
would
say
it's
not
a
special
expense.
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
i
would
say
it
was.
and
then
the
irs
and
you
will
come
and
say
that
isn't
precise
enough.
and
i'd
say
the
irs
has
plenty
of
authority
in
its
regs
to
give
lists
of
examples
which
they
do
in
such
instances.
now,
i'm
posing
that,
not
because
i
bought
into
it,
though
i'm
tempted
to,
but
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
nothing
that
i
could
find
anywhere
that
talked
about
pass-throughs
in
respect
to
the
special
situation
of
trusts
and
estates.
in
the
first
sentence
it
speaks
to
it
in
respect
to
individuals.
it
all
makes
sense.
and
what
they
seem
to
be
saying
is
just
what
i
said
initially.
we
do
agree
trusts
do
have
a
special
claim,
but
only
in
respect
to
special
trust
expenses.
and
which
are
they?
they're
the
ones
an
individual
wouldn't
have
incurred.
and
i'll
put
a
gloss
on
it,
like
we
do
in
law.
i
say
a
reasonable
individual.
i
say
wouldn't
reasonably
have
incurred.
and
then
i
leave
it
up
to
the
irs
to
say
which
are
the
expenses
that
an
individual
would
likely
incur
and
which
ones
he
wouldn't
likely
incur.
now,
that
runs
throughout
tax
law,
doesn't
it,
that
kind
of
list,
what's
a
necessary
expenditure,
what
isn't.
i
mean,
they
do
that
all
the
time,
don't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
buying
into
they're
thing
with
"could".
i
mean,
that
isn't
my
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
glass--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--before...
i
mean,
we
have
lots
of
good
examples.
i
mean,
i
could
have
colored
my
room
at
home,
painted
it
with
light
green
plastic,
but
i
wouldn't
have
done
it.
i
mean,
endless
examples.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
would...
that's
why
i
made
the
suggestion
i
had
earlier.
i
was
doubtful
about
the
wisdom
of
trying
to
turn
this
matter
into
a
purely
factual
one.
and
so
suppose
you
said,
which
would
come
to
about
the
same
thing,
that
expenditure
would
be
incurred
in
this
instance
by
someone
who
didn't
hold
these
assets
in
trust.
what
that
means
is
would
a...
an
investor
not
in
the
trust,
not
holding
it
in
trust,
reasonably
have
been,
or
a
reasonable
investor
have
been
likely
to
make
this
expenditure?
that
turns
it
into
a
more
quasi-legal
question
where
people...
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
judgment,
which
these
things
do
come
down
to.
that's
what
judges
are
there
for,
to
judge.
and
thereby
we
avoid
the
burden-of-proof
problem.
it
comes
to
about
the
same
thing.
is
there
any
objection
to
it?
what's
the
reason
not
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
are
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
would
be,
of
course,
exactly
right,
that
there
could
be
trusts,
very
big
trusts.
children
get
into
fights
trying
to
split
up
the
assets.
millions
is
paid
on
lawyers
and
investment
advisors
to
see
if
each
share,
figured
14
different
ways,
is
going
to
earn
this
money
or
that
money.
and
that
kind
of
thing
exists.
and
there
the
investment
advisors
are
likely
to
be
special.
so
you
can't
say
investment
advice
is
always
special
or
never
special.
now,
again,
this
seems
to
me
not
unknown,
this
kind
of
problem,
to
the
internal
revenue
law,
and
therefore
there
tend
to
be
methods
of
allowing
exceptions,
of
putting
burdens.
i
mean,
is
this
case
somehow...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
really
for
a
form
of
words
to
write
that
does
not
use
the
word
"could"
but
which
gets
at
what
i
think
the
statute
was
after,
which
is:
let
them
have
this
no
floor
for
their
special
stuff
but
not
for
ordinary
stuff
that
others
would
have
incurred
regardless.
i
want
to
know
what
form
of
words.
i
find
it
difficult
to
go
beyond
the
statute,
frankly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
reject
this
word
"could"
and
"uniqueness",
now
what
form
of
word
should
i
write?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
had
you
to
choose
between
that
and
getting
the
idea
of
the
reasonable
taxpayer
who
didn't
hold
this
in
trust,
which
would
you
choose?
