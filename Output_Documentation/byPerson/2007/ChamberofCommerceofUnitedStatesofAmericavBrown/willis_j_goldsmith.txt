mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
ab
1889,
california
defunded
employer
speech
about
union
organizing
because
the
state's
labor
policy
is
that
such
speech
interferes
with
employee
free
choice.
the
federal
policy
is
that
employer
speech
enhances
employee
free
choice.
california's
labor
policy
is
designed
to
discourage
exactly
what
the
nlra
promotes.
the
fact
that
california
implemented
its
labor
policy
as
an
exercise
of
its
spending
authority
is
irrelevant
under
gould.
if
the--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
exceptions
to
the
policy,
in
particular
those
that
allow
state
funds
to
be
spent
for
things
that
clearly
facilitate
union
organizing,
for
example,
that
it's
not
prohibited
under
ab--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--i
think...
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
and
the
cases
of
the
nlrb
have
made
clear
that
free,
open,
robust
debate
is
important
on
all
matters
having
to
do
with
the
union/employer
relationship.
that
was
certainly
what
the
court
noted
in
linn.
the
fact
that
employer
speech
is,
i
think,
absolutely
critical
to
an
employee
being
well-enough
informed
to
make
an
informed
judgment
about
whether
to
say
yes
or
no
to
a
union,
further
underscores
the
point.
a
union
election
or
any
situation
involving
a
contest
of
any
sort
between
a
union
and
an
employer
is
something
on
which
both
parties
should
have
the
right
to
speak,
and
to
speak
in
a
noncoercive
way,
and
i
think
that
clearly
the
national
labor
relations
act
promotes
that.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
your
honor,
those
are
three
statutes
that
the
court
below
and
respondents
rely
on
heavily.
those
statutes,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
in
any
way
reflect
the
meaning
or
the
sense
of
congress
that
employer
speech
is
to
be
inhibited
in
connection
with
union
organizing.
those
in
no
way,
i
think,
reflect
the
overall
intent
of
congress.
more
ever,
nothing
in
those
statutes,
in
any
way,
undercuts
the
basic
principles
of
the--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--medicare
was
the
fourth,
i
believe.
it
was
a
regulation
not
a
statute.
but
certainly
in
doing
that,
congress
didn't
in
any
way
modify
the
nlra.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
those
statutes
that
suggests
that
this
court's
principles,
as
laid
down
in
machinists
and
garmon,
were
in
any
way
to
be
inhibited.
and,
moreover,
what
congress
can
do
certainly
doesn't
mean
that
the
states
have
the
same
right.
but--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
it's
not
modified
in
the
same
way
that
ab
1889
modifies
it,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
under
those
statutes
there
is
no
requirement
that
funds
be
segregated.
there
is
no
possibility
of
litigation,
treble
damages
to
follow.
there
is
no
possibility
of
attorneys'
fees
to
the
prevailing
party.
so
those
statutes
are,
i
think,
are
really
unique
and
don't
in
any
way
change
the
basic
principle
that
i
think
all
labor
lawyers
would
agree,
and
that
is
that,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
all
parties
to
a
union
election
or
any
issue
between
a
union
and
an
employer
have
the
right
to
speak
in
a
noncoercive
way.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
well,
i
think
that's
clearly
what
they
say,
but
it's
not
that
simple
given
the
way
this
statute
operates,
your
honor.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
if
i
may
respond
to
both
questions,
your
honor.
first
of
all
the
notion
that
one
can
use
your
own
money,
to
use
the
vernacular,
and
use
it
to
speak,
doesn't
answer
the
most
basic
question
that
the
statute
presents,
and
that
is
that
whether
you
can
or
you
can't...
and
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
moment...
the
fact
is
that
california
has
regulated,
used
its
spending
power
to
make
labor
policy,
something
that
this
court
has
made
clear,
in
gould
and
various
other
cases,
it
cannot
do.
but
even
getting
past
that,
which
i
think
is
the
end
of
the
case,
there
are
certain
employers,
certain
petitioners
here
who
are
a
hundred
percent
funded
by
the
state.
they
have
no
ability,
as
a
result...
when
i
say
"funded
by
the
state"
i
mean
they
depend
for
their
income
on
state
programs,
let's
say...
they
have
no
ability,
none,
to
speak
to
employees.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
the
state
has
effectively--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
the
state's
argument
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
that's
a
free-market
choice.
they
can
either
do
business
in
california
or
not.
and
i
would
refer
the
court--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--they
can,
your
honor,
that's
true,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
because
for
those
that...
because
of
the
service
that
they
provide,
such
as
under
medi-cal,
they
have
chosen
to
be
in
business
with
the
state.
they
are
being
forced
to
make
an
election
between
doing
business
with
the
state
or
giving
up
an
nlra
protected
right.
that
is--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
a
grant
presents
a
slightly
different
problem.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
well,
that
may
be
the
case
for
a
particular
program
or
a
particular
grant,
but
that's
not
what
ab
1889
does,
your
honor.
ab
1889
affects
on
an
across-the-board
basis
every
single
contractor,
every
single
employer
doing
business
with
the
state
of
california.
so
if...
if
the
state
could
show
that
it
were
making
that...
it
was
making
that
policy
decision
for
some
fiscal
purpose,
then
there
might
be
an
argument.
but
that's
concededly
not
the
case
here,
whereas--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--that
might
be
an
argument
that
the
state
could
advance
credibly
if
in
fact
this
statute
had
anything
to
do
with
saving
money.
it
doesn't.
the
court
below
unanimously
concluded
that
this
was
not
anything
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
fiscal
issues;
it
had
solely
to
do
with
making
labor
policy.
and
as
far
as
a
facial
challenge
is
concerned,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
this
statute
was
applied
to
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
your
honor,
that's,
of
course,
my
vernacular
for--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--what
the
court
said,
but
what
the
court
did
say
was
that
the
state
passed...
legislature
passed
and
the
governor
signed
ab
1889
solely
for
labor
policy
purposes,
and
that's
clear
from
the
preamble
to
the
statute.
the
preamble
to
the
statute
says,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
california...
in
so
many
words...
that
employer
speech
interferes
with
employee
free
choice.
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
there's
no
attempt
at
all
to
suggest
that
anything
achieved
by
1889
saves
the
state
a
dime.
that's
an
argument--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--well,
if
the
state
could
establish
that
it
was
acting
as
a
proprietor,
within
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
boston
harbor,
and
establish
as
a
proprietor
that
it
was
doing
something
to
advance
a
fiscal
purpose,
then
perhaps
a
statute
so
worded
would
survive
the
pre-emption
challenge.
but
that
is
clearly
not
what
happened
here.
there's
no
evidence
that
that
happened,
and
that
is
not
the
purpose
or
the
effect
of
ab
1889.
and
as
to
the
facial
challenge
issue,
if
i
could
answer
both
justice
breyer
and
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
this
statute
was
applied
to
the
petitioners.
the
petitioners
went
into
district
court
and
they
said,
this
applies
to
us,
it's
burden
some
for
us
to
do...
to
do
what
the
statute
purports
to
require
us
to
do.
the
district
court
granted
an
injunction
and
so
on.
but
whether
it's
a
facial
challenge
or
as-applied
challenge
i
think
really
makes
no
difference
here.
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
ab
1889
was
not
pre-empted
as
a
matter
of
law.
our
position
is
that
ab
1889
is
pre-empted
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
purpose
and
effect
are
clear.
sending
this
back
to
remand
to
develop
facts
or
trying
to
sort
this
out
and
whether
it's
a
facial
or
as-applied
challenge
really
doesn't
change
the
basic
fact
that
the
court
below,
as
i
said,
decided
this
as
a
matter
of
law
and
nlra
pre-emption
generally
raises
purely
legal
issues.
the
legal
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
scheme
has
been
interfered
with,
and
i
think
that
any
fair
reading
of
this
statute
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
that's
exactly
what
happened.
california
was
very
open
about
it.
the
preamble
says
precisely
that:
we
believe
that
employer
speech
interferes
with
employee
free
choice.
so
that
they
passed
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
and
does
severely
inhibit
an
employer's
ability
to
speak.
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do;
that's
what
they
did;
and
that
interferes
with
the
federal
policy.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
in
terms
of
using
the
words
assist,
promote
and
deter,
those
words
appear
in
those
statutes
in
that
medicare
regulation,
or
statute,
component
of
the
medicare
statute,
and
those
appear
also
in,
in
ab
1899.
but,
you
know,
again,
your
honor,
from
my
perspective
i
think,
you
know,
it's
clear
that
nothing
in
those
statutes
changed
the
fundamental
policy
that
speech,
free
speech,
for
both
employers
and
for
unions
is
something
to
be
encouraged
in
the
context
of
a
union
organizing
drive
for
a
number
of
reasons,
not
the
least
of
which
employees
are
allowed
and
entitled
to
hear
both
sides
of
the
picture
before
being
put
in
the
position
where
they
have
to
make
a
choice.
california
believes
that
employer
speech
is
a
bad
thing.
ab
1899
is
a
reflection
of
that.
they
believe
it's
bad
because
it
interferes
with
employee
free
choice.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
they
can't
use
any
of
those
funds.
the
notion
that
profits...
the
statute
doesn't
say
a
word
about
profits,
and,
of
course,
if
the
statute
were
to
say
something
about
profits,
it
would
make
segregation
of
accounts
problem
in
the
statute
even
worse
than
it
already
is.
but
what
a
nursing
home
has
to
do
is
to
track
every
single
possible
circumstance
under
which
an
employee
of
the
nursing
home
engaged
in
speech
that
was
designed
to
assist...
which
don't
happen
very
often,
presumably...
promote
or
deter
union
organizing.
and
let
me
try
to
bring
it
down
to
what
really
happens
in
the
union
organizing
campaign.
this
is,
by
and
large,
a
seven-day-a-week,
24-hour
a
day
operation.
there
are
any
number
of
encounters
during
the
course
of
the
union
organizing
drive
that
the
employer
responsible
for
complying
with
ab
1899
may
never
even
know
about.
so,
for
example,
if
an
employee
goes
to
his
supervisor
and
says
union
x
is
trying
to
organize
nursing
home,
what
do
you
know
about
union
x?
and
the
supervisor
says,
well,
the
only
thing
i
know
about
union
x
is
they
used
to
represent
the
nursing
home
across
the
street,
and
then
that
nursing
home
is
now
closed.
now,
that
may
be
a
purely
factual
statement,
purely
true
statement.
that's
certainly
what
the
employer
would
argue.
what
the
union
might
argue
is
that
no,
no.
you
have
to
put
that
in
context,
and
that
was
a
statement
designed
to
deter
the
employee
from
voting
for
union
x.
now,
if
the
employer
guesses
wrong
on
that
issue,
that
is
the
employer
says,
well,
this
is
factual,
it's
not
something
designed
to
deter
union
organizing,
he
is
subject
under
the
statute
to
litigation
for
not
having
segregated...
and
i
don't
know
what
he
would
really
segregate;
the
statute
is
unclear.
do
you
segregate
the
time?
do
you
account
for
the
time
that
the
employer
spent
talking--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
unlike
the
prevailing
party
as
the
defendant,
or
the
prevailing
party
will
of
course...
the
prevailing
plaintiff
and
the
prevailing
intervenors
will
recover
reasonable
costs
of
attorney's
fees,
the
prevailing
defendant
under
this
statute
does
not.
there
is...
there
is
no
question
that
it's
even
impossible
for
an
employer
under
the
situation
that
i
described
to
effectively
account
for
that
encounter
that
i
describe
between
an
employer
and
employee.
do
you
take
the
30
seconds
that
it
took
and
allocate
30
seconds
of
the
salary?
do
you
take
the
overtime
for
the
week
that
the
supervisor
might
have
worked?
there
is
really
no
way
that
the
statute
allows
for
that
to
happen,
and
it
i
think
underscores
the
degree
to
which
this
statute
interferes
dramatically
with
nlra
protected
rights.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
forgot
about
that.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
few
comments
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
the
preamble
of
the
statute
makes
it
absolutely
clear
as
to
what
the
state's
purpose
is.
it's
at
page
3a
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition.
it
says
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
not
to
interfere
with
an
employee's
choice
about
whether
to
join
or
to
be
represented
by
a
labor
union.
for
this
reason
the
state
should
not
subsidize...
and
so
on.
so
clearly
the
state
has
a
labor
policy
position.
it's
a
position
as
i
said
at
the
outset
that
is
completely
contrary
to
that
of
the
nlra.
the
nlra's
position
is
that
employers
just
like
unions
ought
to
have
the
right
to
speak
in
a
noncoercive
way
to
their
employees.
secondly,
it
is
not
our
position
that
the
nlra
requires
the
state
to
fund
activities.
it
is
our
position
that
the
nlra
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
states
are
to
stay
out
of
this
area
altogether,
period.
and
that
would
be
the
case
whether
it
is
the
kind
of
statute
that
justice
scalia
was
posing
a
question
about,
whether
it
was
in
effect
anti-union
or
pro-union.
it
doesn't
matter.
they
are
both
pre-empted.
the
state
has
no
business
making
labor
policy.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
unanimous
decisions
of
this
court
in
several
circumstances
i
think
make
that
very
clear.
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
find
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
state
was
regulating
by
making
labor
policy.
if
i
could
make
two
points
about
neutrality.
first
of
all,
the
statute
is
anything
but
neutral.
first
of
all,
the
state's
policy
is
not
one
of
neutrality.
as
i
just
read
from
the
preamble
they
have
a
position;
the
position
is
that
noncoercive
employer
speech
interferes
with
employee
free
choice,
and
the
statute
follows
that
position.
the
decision
to
withdraw
funds
is
not
the
same
thing
as
being
neutral.
your
honor
made
a
reference
to
the
hyde
amendment.
the
hyde
amendment,
congress
withdrew
funds
from...
from
abortion
practitioners.
it
was
not
neutral
about
abortion.
and
california
here
has
made
a
judgment
about
noncoercive
speech.
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
the
lyng
case
seems
to
me
to
be
completely
off
the
point
on
the
pre-emption
issue.
but
there
is
no
question,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
congress
can
make
judgments
about
what
it
chooses
to
fund
or
not
to
fund.
that
did
not
open
the
door
to
the
states
to
do
whatever
they
wanted
to
do
by
way
of
funding
or
not
funding.
lyng
addressed
a
constitutional--
mr.
willis
j.
goldsmith
--but
california
is...
is
not
being
neutral,
not
just
because
of
what
the
preamble
says
but
because
of
the
add-ons
to
the
statute
if
you
will.
california
has
taken
it
much
farther
than
simply
withdrawing
the
subsidy.
california
has
taken
it
to
the
point
that
you're
exposed
to
treble
damages,
but
then
you
have
minute
tracking
and
segregation
of
fund
details,
and
california
has
taken
it
even
one
step
farther
and
said
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
want
to
spend
state
money
to
facilitate
union
organizing,
that's
perfectly
fine
with
us.
you
can
spend
money
to
give
access
to
union
representatives
to
property.
you
can
use
state
money
to...
to
facilitate
neutrality
agreements
of
one
sort
or
another.
anything
that
would
help
a
union
organize
employees,
that's
fine
by
us.
so
california
is
not
neutral
in
the
same
way
that
lyng
was
neutral,
but
again
i
would
suggest
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
lyng
didn't
open
the
door,
any
more
than
rust
or
regan
opened
the
door
to
the
states
to
make
labor
policy
by
granting
or
withholding
moneys
in
any
way
that
they
saw
fit.
thank
you.
