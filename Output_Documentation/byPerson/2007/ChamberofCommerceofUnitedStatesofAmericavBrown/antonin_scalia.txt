why
do
you
say
the
labor
policy
promotes
it?
it
certainly
permits
it,
but
what...
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i'm
talking
about
the...
the
federal
policy.
you
say
the
federal
policy
promotes
this
employer
speech.
why
do
you
say
it
promotes
it?
it
clearly
permits
it.
it
clearly
does
not
discourage
it,
but
is
that
the
same
as
promoting
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
he
guesses
right,
he
is
subject
to
the
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
if
he
guesses
wrong,
he
is
subject
to
litigation.
he
is
subject
to
the
litigation
even
if
he
guesses
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
it's
a
very
different
case
mr.
hungar?
i
don't
really
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
labor
policy.
i
mean,
you
have
to
acknowledge
it
was
labor
policy
in
these
other
cases,
just
a
different
labor
policy
that
the
federal
government
wanted,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
difference
between
this
and
rust
is
that
the
federal
government
in
rust
was
assuredly
following
a
federal
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
was
a
federal
policy
that
the
federal
government
had
every
right
to
implement.
we
do
not
want
to
support
abortions.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
policy
that
california
is
trying
to
implement...
namely,
we
do
not
want
the
employer
to...
in
its
view...
disrupt
the...
the
labor
management
relations
by...
by
opposing
union...
unionization.
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
is
the
issue,
whether
that
is
a
policy
that
california
can...
can
implement.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
because
it's
wasting
the
money
or
because
that
is
their--
justice
antonin
scalia
--their
labor
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like...
like
gould.
i
mean,
there
is
a
case
where
a
state
used
state
money,
no
contracting
with
any...
with
any
company
that's
been
convicted
of
unfair
labor
practices
three
times.
strictly
state
contracting
policy,
we
just
don't
want
to
spend
our
money
dealing
with
such
a
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
state's
managing
its
own
money?
it's
our
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
just
don't
want
to
deal
with
people
who
oppose
unions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
reason
for
not
paying
for
this
activity
is
that
you
don't
like
this
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
call
that...
i
call
that
regulating
the
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
allow
the
employer
to
engage
in
all
other
employee
relations,
and
you're
willing...
that
can
be
done
without...
the
one
thing
the
employer
can't
do
is
speak
out
against
the
union.
this
isn't
because
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
question
of
when
the
contract
is
done
is
different
from
the
question
of
when
the
money
is
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
asking
with
when
the
money
is
paid.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
going
to
go
through
all
of
these
one
by
one,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you
a
basic
question
that
doesn't
require
you
to
get
into
one
by
one.
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
doesn't
want
to
have
its
money
used
to
assist
unions.
this
is
an
antiunion
state
and
it
adopts
the
same
kind
of
law
that
you
have.
and
it
simply
says,
none
of...
none
of
this
state's...
yes,
you
can
recognize
unions
if
you
like,
but
none
of
the
money
that
we
give
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--shall
be
used...
shall
be
used
for
collective
bargaining
or
for
any...
any
activities
involving
unions.
justice
antonin
scalia
same.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
employer.
no
employer
getting
money
from
the
state
can
expend
any
of
our
money...
the
same
way
yours
is...
in
collective
bargaining
with
unions
or
in
anything
else.
now,
we
are
not
stopping
employers
from
doing
that.
we
just
don't
like
unions,
and
it's
our
money
and
we
don't
want
this
employer
to
use
it
for
unions.
would
that
be
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that...
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
if
it
violates
federal
policy,
it
violates
federal
policy.
livadas
said
you
can't
do
it
because
it
violates
federal
policy,
which
is
to
favor
unionization,
and
not
to
deter.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
about
that
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
does
the
statute
i
posit.
just
don't
use
state
money.
you
can
use
all
of
your
own
money
to
deal
with
unions;
just
we
don't
want
our
money
used
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
clearly
would
be
banned
and
i
don't
see
why
yours
is
any
different.
