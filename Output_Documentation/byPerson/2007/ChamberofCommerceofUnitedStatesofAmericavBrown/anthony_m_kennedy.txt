let
me
just
be
clear.
the
statute
with
reference
to
state
contractors,
which
is
the
$50,000
statute,
and
the
statute
with
reference
to
private
employers,
which
is
the
$10,000
statute,
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
law
is
applicable
only
if
the
money
is
paid
before
all
the
work
is
done?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
on
that
point
you're
in
disagreement
with
the
ninth
circuit,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
the
principal
rationale
for
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
incorrect
in
your
view?
