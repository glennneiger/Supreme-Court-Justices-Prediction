if
you
take
the
example
of
a
nursing
home
that
participates
in
the
medi-cal
program,
what
does
this
require?
they
have
to
segregate
the
funds
that
they
get
from
the
state,
and
they
can't
use...
is
it
the
case
they
can't
use
any
of
those
funds
for
union-related
speech
or
just
the
portion
that
does
not
represent
profits?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
when
the
state
pays
a
program
participant...
let's
again
take
the
case
of
a
nursing
home...
for
providing
services
to
patients
who
are
covered
by
medi-cal,
and
money
is
paid
to
the
nursing
home,
it's
your
position
that
remains
the
state
's
money.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
that
was
an
either/or.
[laughter]
which
might
be
the
case?
