bader

then
why
did
congress
in
several
statutes
have
a
provision
from
which
california
copied
when
it
enacted
this
measure?
in
several
statutes,
the
congress
has
said
this
federal
money
will
go
to
the
grantee,
if
the
grantee
says
it
will
not
use
any
money
that
we
give
them
to
assist,
promote,
or
deter
union
organizing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
run
against
that
principle
because
they
say
at
least
under
these
programs...
i
think
there
were
more
than
three.
wasn't
medicare--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--those...
those
grantees
would
be
subject
to
the
nlra.
so,
as
to
them,
it
is
modified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you...
you
are
bringing
a
facial
challenge,
and
i
thought
that
you
must
show,
not
that
the
state
must
show,
and
the
state...
the
simple
argument
is
look
we
are
paying
for
certain
things,
and
we
want
to
get
what
we
paid
for.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
that
we
could
have
paid
for,
but
we...
we
want
to
get,
say,
a
training
program
for
elementary
schoolteachers.
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
union
organizing.
we
don't
want
to
pay
for
union
organizing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
the
lower
court
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
getting
what
it
is
paying
for
and
not
paying
for
things
it
doesn't
want
to
pay
for?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it
would
come
out...
it
would
come
out
differently
if
the
statute
has
said,
we
want
to
get
what
we
pay
for
and
we
don't...
we
choose
not
to
pay
for
labor
relations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
say
something
different
from
what
congress
said
in
those
three
or
four
statutes
that
were
mentioned
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
policy
was
congress
implementing
in
the
federal
funding
statute
that
california
copied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
do
say
that
the
money
is
not
to
be
spent
to
assist,
promote,
or
deter
union
organizing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
do
they
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't...
there's
no
reason,
rhyme
or
reason
to
what
they
would
have
done
in
these
three
statutes
that
you
say
is
flatly
contrary
to
national
labor
relations
policy?
