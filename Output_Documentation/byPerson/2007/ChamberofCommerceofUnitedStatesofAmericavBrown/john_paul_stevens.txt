mr.
gottesman,
can
i
ask
sort
of
a
background
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
if
the
state
of
california
had
its
labor
relations
agency
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
engage
in
this
employer
speech
described
here,
that
that
would
be
pre-empted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
adopted
the
rule
that
the
federal
labor
board
applied
prior
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
pre-empted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
require
that
this...
it
arguably
requires
that
this
area
of
combat
between
labor
and
management
be
unregulated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
several
organizations
whose
members
do
business
with
the
state
of
california.
they
sued
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
a
california
statute
which
among
other
things
prohibits
employers
that
receive
state
grants
and
state
program
funds
from
using
the
funds
to
assist,
promote
or
deter
union
organization.
the
statute
also
imposes
substantial
compliance
burdens
and
litigation
risks
on
any
employer
that
seeks
to
use
its
own
funds
to
engage
in
such
speech.
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
partial
summary
judgment
holding
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
preempts
the
grant
and
program
fund
restrictions
because
they
regulate
the
employer's
speech
about
union
organizing
in
circumstances
in
which
congress
intended
there
to
be
free
debate.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
concluding
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
states
from
imposing
such
restrictions
in
the
use
of
their
own
funds.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
contrary
to
congressional
intent,
the
challenged
provisions
of
the
california
statute
regulate
non-coercive
employer
speech
about
union
organizing.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
