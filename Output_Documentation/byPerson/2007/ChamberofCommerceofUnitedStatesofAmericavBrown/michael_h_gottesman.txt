mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
until
this
statute
was
enacted,
california
was
in
the
anomalous
position
that
it
was
financing
speech
on
one
side
of
union
organizing
campaigns
but
not
on
the
other,
because
most
grants,
programs,
contracts
include
employment
costs
as
an
allowable
cost.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
i
mean,
a
private
employer
could
have
said
the
same
things
that
the
state
said:
don't
use
our
money
to
do
this.
and
they
would
not
have
violated
anything
by
doing
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
what
they
claim.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that's
true
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
state's
statute
said:
even
after
you
have
earned
this
money
by
performing
all
the
service
we
asked,
you
still
can't...
it's
therefore
now
your
money;
you
can't
use
it.
that
is
not
what
the
statute
means.
that
is...
the
state
has
been
very
clear
about
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
there
haven't
been
any
cases
decided
under
this
statute,
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
is
that
the
petitioners
did
not
move
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
you're
forbidding
us
from
using
our
money.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
solely
on
the
ground
that
it
was
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
give
them
money
that
they
could
use
for
these
purposes.
and
that
it
was
wrong--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
well,
yes,
on
that
core
issue,
they
said
to...
to
tell
us
that
we
cannot
use
state
funds
for
this
purpose...
well,
they
are
still
state
funds...
is
to
regulate
us.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
wrong.
this
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no.
our
argument...
let's
take
one
of
the
two
provisions
that
the
district
court
struck
down,
and
that
petitioners
argue
properly
struck
down.
it
said
that
when
we
give
you
grant
money,
don't
use
that
money
for
this
purpose.
now,
the
state
gives
them
the
money
up
front,
before
they
have
provided
the
services.
and
that's
true
universally.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
first,
if
they
don't
spend
all
the
grant
money
on
the
prescribed
purposes,
they
have
to
give
it
back
to
the
state
because
grants
aren't
profit--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
and
that's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right,
but
that,
your
honor,
is
where
the
concern
that
the
state
was
addressing
comes
in.
traditionally,
when
the
state
gave
grant
money,
one
of
the
permissible
uses
of
that
money
was
for
the
costs
of
employees
who
had
to
perform
the
grant,
and
without
this
limitation,
that
would
have
included
the
employer
spending
the
money
to
combat
unions.
that
would
be...
could
arguably
be
a
legitimate
cost.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well...
yes.
well,
our
position
is
certainly
yes.
that
is,
the
state
is
entitled
to
prescribe
what
it
is
prepared
to
pay
for
in
a
grant
and
what
not,
and
it
is
not
required
to
subsidize
the
employer's
campaign--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--against
a
union
or
for
a
union,
for
that
matter.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
not
the
state's
policy,
and
the
preamble
to
the
statute
does
not
say:
the
state
disapproves
of
employers
spending
money.
what
it
says--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no.
they
don't
want
them
to
spend
them
the
employer's
money...
the
state's
money
to
talk
about
unionization.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
because
the
state
wants--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--because
the
state
wants
to
be
neutral,
and
that...
the
right--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
it
prohibits
them
using
the
state's
money
to
do
it.
of
course
they
can
use
their
own
money
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
i
said
"inconsistently".
what
i
said
was,
previously
it
was
within
the
permissible
scope
of
a
grant
to
spend
money
in
an
organizing
campaign,
either
assisting,
promoting,
or
deterring
unionization.
the
state
is
now
saying
that
will
no
longer
be.
we
don't
really
want
to
spend
grant
money
on
that,
and
our
reason
is
that
we
think
we...
the
state's
money
should
not
be
used
by
either
side
in
that
union
organizing--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--because
there
is
no
federal
labor
policy
that
requires
states
to
use
state
treasury
money
to
finance
a
party
who
is
engaged
in
this
debate.
that's
why
this
is
just
like
rust.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right,
but
there
we're
saying
we
won't
deal
with
you.
that's...
that
would
classically...
if
the
state
in
this
case
said,
no
employer
who
opposes
unions
can
have
a
state
contract,
that
would
be
gould.
it
would
also
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
but
it
is
not--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
there's
a
huge
difference
between
saying,
don't
use
our
money
to
do
something,
and
saying,
we
won't
deal
with
you
even
when
you
use
your
own
money
to
do
it.
the
implication
that
this
is
pre-emptive--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
they
have
their
own
money,
they
can
spend
it
on
that.
they
just
can't
use
the
state's
money.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
if
we
have
a
grantee
who
has
no
other
money,
that
doesn't
mean
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
provide
them
money
to
oppose
unionization.
it
would
be
very
odd
to
believe...
and
this
is,
after
all,
implied
pre-emption...
that
it
was
congress's
intent
without
mentioning
it
to
say
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
states
to
provide
funding
to
employers
to
do
this.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
employer
speech
with
its
own
money?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course
that
would
be
pre-empted,
absolutely
pre-empted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
not
pre-empted,
it
would
certainly
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
as
well,
to
punish
them
for
engaging
in
speech.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
exactly.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
exactly.
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course
that
would
be
pre-empted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
our
position,
however,
is
that
it's
quite
different
to
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
the
state
to
pay
for
these
activities.
and--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
and
this
is
not
regulation,
for
the
very
reasons
that
this
court
in
regan
and
rust
and
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
had
said
that
it
is
not
regulation
to
simply
say,
we
the
government
are
not
going
to
pay
for
this
activity.
that's
all
that
california
is
saying
in
this
case:
we
are
not
going
to
pay
for
it.
it's
the
policy
of
the
state
not
to
interfere
in
these
union
organizing
drives;
therefore...
and
this
is
the
precise
words
of
the
preamble...
"for
this
reason,
the
state
should
not
subsidize.
"
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
not
true.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
not
at
all
the
case,
your
honor.
there's
nothing
in
this
preamble...
the
other
side
keeps
characterizing
the
preamble,
which
they
don't
include
in
their
statutory
appendix,
as
saying,
we
don't
like
the
employer
doing
it.
that's
not
what
it
says;
it's
on
page
3.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
you've
got
for
or
against.
this
is
content
discrimination,
not
viewpoint
discrimination;
and
it
is
content
discrimination
whose
purpose
is
to
keep
the
state's
funds
out
of
this
area
of
context.
the
taxpayers'
money
should
not
be
spent
supporting
one
side
and
not
the
other
in
these
disputes.
this
court
in
the
linn
case...
and
i
want
to
quote
this
sentence,
because
this
is
the
key
to
why
a
policy
of
neutrality
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
state's
money
is
not,
you
know,
regulated.
we...
this
was
a
case
in
which,
to
be
sure,
it
was
the
federal
government
was
denying
food
stamps
to
strikers.
and
the
claim
was
that
was
a
violation
of
their
associational
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
everybody
else
who
satisfies
the
test
for
food
stamps
is
entitled
to
them,
but
we
are
not
going
to
give
them
to
strikers.
and
when
the
federal
government
is
asked
why
is
that,
they
said,
well,
we
don't
want
to
get
involved.
to
be
sure
if
we
give
them
the
money,
that
would
make
it
likely
the
strike
would
go
on
longer.
but
we
are
not
being
anti-union.
we
just
want
to
be
hands
off.
we
want
to
be...
we
don't
want
federal
money
spent
to
help
one
side
or
the
other
in
this
labor
dispute.
and
what
this
court
said
was,
we
have
little
trouble
in
concluding
that
that
provision
is
rationally
related
to
the
legitimate
governmental
objective
of
avoiding
undue
favoritism
to
one
side
or
the
other
in
private
labor
disputes.
now,
that's
the
core
of
what
this
statute
is
about.
the
labor
union--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
just
takes
the
state's
money
out.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
they
were
arguing
for
or
against.
the
point
is
that--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
well
that
may
well
be
true,
but
the
point
is
when
they
are
arguing
against
the
union,
until
this
statute
state
money
was
being
used
to
argue
against
the
union,
the
union
was
not
getting
any
state
money
to
respond.
the
state
was
funding
one
side
of
this
dispute.
and
the
notion
that
it
was
an
implied
purpose
of
congress
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
compel
states
to
fund
one
side
of
a
dispute
with
a
subsidy
is...
would
be
remarkable.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
if
this...
if
the
nursing
home...
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways
in
which
this
money
is
paid
to
the
state.
if
the
situation
is
the
nursing
home
first
provides
the
services
and
when
they
have
done
so
billed
the
state
for
the
money,
that's
not
state
funds.
once
they
receive
the
money,
since
they
put
the
money
up
in
front
to
provide
the
service,
they
are
being
reimbursed
for
it,
that's
not
the
state's
funds.
it's
the
state's
funds
if
the
state
gives
them
the
money
up
front.
as
is
true
universally
with
respect
to
grants.
we
give
you
this
money.
this
money
now
because
of
this
statute
its
purposes
are
limited
so
that
they
do
not
include
engaging
in...
one
side
or
the
other
in
union
organizing.
if
you
have
your
own
money,
feel
free
to
spend
your
own
money
on
that,
but
we
are
not
giving
you
this
money
for
that
purpose.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
if
you
look
at
the
contract
one,
which
is
not
actually
before
the
court
because
nobody
had
standing...
the
district
court
ruled
to
raise
it...
it
says
the
state
funds
to
assist,
promote
or
defer...
union
organizing
during
the
life
of
the
contract
are
not
to
be
spent
on
this.
so
once
the
contract
is
done,
that
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--of
course.
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
so
when
you
pay
the
money
up
front
and
you
say
here
is
your
money
to
do
the
contract--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's...
that's
a
question
about
a
meaning
of
a
provision
that
isn't
at
this
issue
in
this
case.
the
ones
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
might
well
be
the
case.
but
we
don't
have
an
interpretation
of
that
provision
of
the
california
law.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
oh.
i
say
it
might
be
the
case.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
[laughter]
but
again,
that
issue
isn't
here.
what
we've
got
here
are
programs,
some
of
which
the
state
advances
the
money,
and
some
of
which
it
pays
after
the
services
have
been
completed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
we
the
state
responded
say
the
same
thing
in
our
brief.
we
say
it
at
pages
26
to
27:
the
state
maintains
a
legitimate
interest
in
program
funds
until
such
time
as
the
program
participant
has
provided
the
state
with
a
service
the
state
has
funded.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
is
no
question
about
that,
because
in
that
case,
that
would
be
covered
by
the
contract
provision
that
isn't
here.
but
it
says
once
the
contract
is
completed,
it's
your
money.
so
the
concern
here
only
is
that
they
not
use
our
money.
the
state's
brief
also
says--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
that's
a
question
of...
remember,
neither
of
the
lower
courts
has
interpreted
this
statute.
this
statute
has
never
been
interpreted.
that's...
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that's
because
the
argument
that
you
all
have
been
asking
me
about
was
not
raised
in
summary
judgment
by
the
petitioners.
their
core
argument
is
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
subsidize
our
speech.
and
that's
the
only
issue
they
brought
up
on
summary
judgment.
because
judge
beezer
in
the
panel
decision
said,
oh,
look
at
all
these,
quote,
as
he
called
them,
horribles
that
will
come
from
this,
judge
beezer
got
into
all
these
issues:
the
accounting
would
be
burdensome,
that
it's
going
to
be
the
employer's
own
money.
and
what
the
majority
said
is,
number
one,
that's
not
here.
and
number
two,
they
said
this...
i
believe
it's
on
page
34
of
the
appendix
but
i'm
not
certain
of
the...
wait
a
minute,
i
can
tell
you
the
exact
page.
yes,
it's
page
34,
in
a
sense
the
parade
of
horribles
goes
far
beyond
the
scope
of
plaintiff's
facial
challenge,
that
is
the
challenge
they
brought
on
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
made
no
findings
nor
is
there
evidence
that
this
statute,
quote,
"co-ops
the
payments
for
goods
and
services
and
profits
realized
under
a
contract.
"
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
is
affirm,
because
all
the
court
has
said
is
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
improperly
granted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
first
of
all,
let's
talk
about
the
burdens,
the
accounting
burdens,
which
are
actually
quite
minimal
under
medicaid,
because
they
already
have
to
do
this
because
the
federal
medicaid
requires
them
to...
to
account
for
which
were
allowable
expenditures
and
which
were
not
in
a
very
detailed
accounting
form.
and
of
course,
the
federal
medicaid
says
that
this
is
not
allowable
expenditure,
so
they
have
to
do
this
anyway,
half
this
money
is
federal
and
half
is
is
state.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
pardon?
no.
i
just
wanted
to
give
an
example
of
that.
but
with
respect
to
each
of
these,
we
need
to
have
a
record.
for
example,
on
the
burdens
there
is
an
affidavit
from
an
accounting
firm
submitted
by
the
defendants
that
says
this
is
really
not
burdensome
at
all.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
give
who.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
moneys
we
give
to
the
employer?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
not
sure
which
question
you're
asking.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
that
would
be
problematic
but
only
for
this
reason.
if
the
employer
is
allowed
to
spend
the
state's
money
to...
to
bargain
with
nonunion
employees
and
you
know
medical
researchers,
whatever,
negotiate
contracts
with
them,
but
the
state
says
you
can't
do
it
for
collective
bargaining,
then
that
is
exactly
the
livadas
case.
that
is
the
case
in
which
the
state
is
saying
your
entitlement
to
a
state
benefit
turns
on
whether
you
are
unionized
or
not.
in
this
case
we'll
let
the
employer
do
this
with
nonunion
employees,
but
not
with
unionized
employees.
but
if
the
state
said
we
don't
want
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
negotiating--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--right.
but
this
statute
neither
favors
nor
deters.
this
statute--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--this
statute
simply
says
we
don't
want
to
subsidize
either
party,
and
as
a
practical
matter
we
are
only
subsidizing
one
party
in
union
organizing.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well
because...
it
would
not
be
banned
if
the
state
had
said
we
don't
want
you
to
use
state
money
to
negotiate
contracts
with
any
of
your
employees;
that
would
not
be
banned.
it
would
be
banned
if
they
singled
out
only
unionized
employees
that
you're
not
allowed
to
use
it
with.
you're
allowed
to
use
it
with
nonunion
employees.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
there
is
a
state
disputed
facts
in
the
district
court
on
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but
our
argument
is
that
this
is
not
regulation.
to
say
that
the
state
money
is
not
going
to
be
spent
for
this
is
not
regulation.
just
as
regan
and
rust
says--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--it
just
says--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
are
not
regulating
whether
the
employer
opposes
unions.
what
we
are
regulating
is
what
they
do
with
the
state's
money.
that's
the
only
regulation
that's
here.
we
are
saying
don't
use
our
money
for
this
purpose.
the
only
regulation
that's
going
on
is
to
see
whether
you
use
the
state's
money--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
if
you
say
that
a
state's
position,
"we
don't
want
our
money
to
be
used--
"
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--is
regulation--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i'm
having...
the
problem
i'm
having
with
your
honor's
question
is
presuming
the
answer
to
something.
the...
if
this
is
regulation,
then
there
is
a
serious
prospect
of
its
being
pre-emptive,
but
this
is
not
regulation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
but
the
only
issue
they
raised
on
summary
judgment
is
that
to
deny
us
your
money,
the
state's
money,
is
regulation.
and
our
position
is
that
to
deny
you
the
state's
money
is
not
regulation,
any
more
than
it
was
in
regan,
in
rust,
in
this
whole
line
of
cases
where
the
court
has
said
the
government's
choice
not
to
subsidize
an
activity
is
not
regulation.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
we
are.
the
ninth
circuit
misunderstood
boston
harbor.
it
thought
boston
harbor
created
two
boxes
that
represented
the
whole
world.
you're
either
a
market
participant
or
you're
a
regulator.
that's
not
what
boston
harbor
said,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
it.
what
boston
harbor
said,
if
you
regulate
you
are
vulnerable
to
pre-emption
arguments;
if
you
are
not
regulating,
then
you
are
free
of
pre-emption
concerns.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
it's
not...
no.
the
ninth
circuit
also
talked
about
the
first
amendment
and
got
it
right.
it
said
when
it
talked
about
the
dissent
had
said
what
this
state
is
doing
is
violating
the
first
amendment,
and
the
ninth
circuit's
response
is
no,
that's
not
right.
all
this
is
is
withholding
a
subsidy,
and
the
first
amendment
cases
are
clear:
that's
not
regulation
of
a
speech.
what
the
ninth
circuit
thought
erroneously
is
that
boston
harbor
had
denied
it
the
right
to
take
that
same
view,
because
it
thought
that
boston
harbor
said
that
everything
is
regulation
unless
it's
market
participation,
and
that's
not
what
boston
harbor
said,
and
this
is
not
regulation.
