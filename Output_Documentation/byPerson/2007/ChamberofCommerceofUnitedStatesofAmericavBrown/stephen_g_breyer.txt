say:
speak,
go
ahead,
speak,
speak.
just
not
on
our
nickel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
also
say...
by
the
way,
that
you
answer
this,
i'd
keep
this
in
mind...
you
may
be
right
about
it
being
too
much
of
an
administrative
burden,
the
treble
damages
et
cetera,
but
they've
made
major
concessions
here,
and
they
say
that's
a
matter
to
be
worked
out
on
remand.
and
it
may
be
that
they
have
to
be
very
careful
about
inhibiting
your
speech.
so
let's
go
back
over
those
administrative
provisions
one
by
one.
they
are
suggesting
to
us,
as
i
read
it,
don't
do
that
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
have...
you
have
a
park
service
of
the
state
and
have
you
a
hotdog
stand
there,
it
runs
the
hotdogs,
it's
private,
but
the
state
pays
for
everything.
the
state
pays
for
everything.
and
it
happens
that,
in
the
grant,
they
have
no
place
for
talking
about
the
union.
you're
saying
they
are
required
to
add
to
the
legislation,
a
special
grant,
so
that
the
employer
can
speak
of
the
union?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
because
they
say
here
we
are
talking
about
100
percent
money
that
comes
out
of
the
state
treasury
and
all
we
are
saying
is
use
that
money
for
the
state
purposes,
and
those
purposes
do
not
include
talking
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
union.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if...
if...
and
i
hide
contrary
to
fact,
perhaps,
that
a
magic
administrative
scheme
were
invented
so
that
there
was
no
administrative
problem,
we
could
identify
with
the
greatest
of
ease
each
penny
that
came
from
a
state
and
which
did
not?
and
then
the
state
said,
you
know,
we
do
have
a
policy
here.
we
actually
favor
labor
unions
in
our
state,
and
some
other
state
might
have
a
different
policy.
but
we
think
it
best
that
the
state
officials
involved
when
their
company...
when
their
department
is
being
organized,
to
say
nothing.
we
think
it
best
that
the
employers
that
we
pay
a
hundred
percent
to,
given
their...
their
strong
funding
by
the
state,
that
they
got
to
find
some
money
elsewhere,
and
those
we
pay
50
percent
to
better
use
the
private
money,
not
use
our
money.
now,
no
administrative
burden
whatsoever,
but
that's
the
policy.
now,
is
there
some
rule
or
statute
that
would
make
that
unlawful
or
pre-empted
that
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
on
all
these
things
which
i
think
they
are
asking
us
on
the
other
side
to
leave
for
another
day,
none
of
them
exist.
they
all
work
perfectly.
it's
only
the
magic
system
has
been
developed
to,
without
any
extraneous
burden,
segregate
the
state
money
from
the
non-state
money.
and
the
only
rule
is
don't
use
the
state
money
when
you
speak.
that's
the
only
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
other
states
have
exactly
opposite
rules,
they
are
right-to-work
states.
they
give
you
extra
state
money.
so...
but
one
state
has
this
rule
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--ah,
well,
if
it's
a
very
different
case,
then
why
aren't
they
right
to
say
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
leave
that
very
different
case
which
raises
all
the
issues
to
be
worked
out
when
we
discover
whether
this
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
my
right-to-work
example
equally...
equally
pre-empted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
they
could
not
say
in
utah,
to
take
a
state
at
random,
the...
here
we
have
government
grants
and
there's
overhead,
and
we
would
like
you
to
spend
this
overhead;
indeed,
you're
certainly
free
to
spend
this
overhead
in
speaking
as
much
as
you
want,
should
there
be
an
organizing
campaign.
don't
worry
about
spending
the
government
part.
can
they
do
that?
you
say
no,
they
couldn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
did
on
that
point
on
page
27
and
25
and
29
of
the
"a
f
l
c
i
o>
[=afl-cio]
brief,
i
took
the
statements
there,
where
it
would
say
<organizations",
namely
organizations,
even
those
that
receive
a
hundred
percent
of
their
money
from
the
state
are
free
to
use
their
profits?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
are
any,
or
any
other
non-state
moneys
they
had?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
sell
them
tables
and
they
write
you
a
check,
the
state,
for
the
tables,
at
that
point
the
check
is
yours?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
recommendation
as
to...
we've
heard
today,
too,
in
the
briefs
it's
there,
i
put
the
thing
that
i've
heard
as...
well,
the
example
with
the
tables
is
an
example
of
it.
when
does
the
profit
actually
accrue?
is
there
treble
damage
provision
that
makes
this
much
worse?
are
there
administrative
requirements
that
in
practice
make
it
impossible?
is
it
administered
in
such
a
way
that
the
employee
we
heard
about
would
just
not
know
what
to
say,
the
employer's
representative?
all
those
things
could
be
problems,
and
you
say,
well,
they
haven't
been
dealt
with
yet.
and
your
recommendation
as
to
what
we
should
do
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
we
did
that,
how
would
all
these
problems
be
worked
out?
i
mean,
how
would
the
arguments
that
you...
they
think
are
far
too
burdensome,
you
think
they
are
not
and
can
be
done
properly,
how
does
that
get
worked
out?
