chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-939,
chamber
of
commerce
versus
brown.
mr.
goldsmith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
not
the
state's
fault.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
can
do
business
with
other
entities
beside
the
state.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
you've
got
a
friend
on
the
other
side
still.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
hungar.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
spending
clause
question?
you...
the
federal
government
has
a
lot
of
programs
where
they
use
their
own
money
and
they
come
with
a
lot
of
conditions,
and
you...
your
office
frequently
argues
that
those
are
justified
under
the
spending
clause.
why
isn't
what
california
is
doing
here
similarly
justified?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
tell
whether
they
are
using
their
spending
power
to
regulate
as
opposed
to
simply
attaching
conditions
to
what's
done
with
state
funds?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
a
case
like
rust
versus
sullivan,
is
the
federal
government
acting
to
promote
policy,
or
is
it
simply
acting
in
a
proprietary
capacity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
spending
power
versus
regulatory
power
in
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
give
me
an
example
of
a
spending
clause
provision
that
would
be
acceptable,
not
necessarily
in
this
context,
but
in
general,
because
you
would
say,
well,
that's
not
trying
to
implement
a
policy
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
was
anyone
who
hired
a
company
to
do
any
kind
of
work,
right?
because
the
federal
policy
meant
that
they
couldn't
try
to
restrict
what
activities
the
company
engaged
in
with
respect
to
union
organizing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
not
quite
accurate.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
what
the
state
was
doing
was
in
effect
regulating
labor
relations--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
that
that
activity
was
pre-empted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
the
policy...
the
policy
is
they
don't
want
employers
to
talk
about
unionization.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that...
how
is
that
different
from
saying
there's
a
federal
rule,
an
osha
requirement
you've
got
to
have
certain
protective
devices
or
whatever,
and
the
state
says,
well,
we
want
to
get
the
most
out
of
our
money,
so
our
money
cannot
be
used
to
put
in
these
federally
required
safety
devices;
you
can
use
somebody
else's
money
for
that.
why
isn't
that
the
same
thing
here?
you're
saying
there's
a
federal
labor
policy
that
allows
this,
and
we
don't
want
our
money
to
be
spent
implementing
that
policy
or
pursuant
to
that
policy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you're
saying
it
doesn't
give
favoritism
to
one
side
or
another?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
depends,
as
a
practical
matter,
on
the
view
that
there
are
at
least
some
employers
who
would
be
arguing
in
favor
of
unionization?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
my
point
is
that
there
are
precious
few
who
argue
in
favor
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
there
is
a
warranty
for
another
year,
say
if
these
tables
break
you
have
to
replace
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
want
to
get
back
to
your
responses
on
the
procedural
costs
of
the
case.
you
said
we
don't
know
what
the
regulatory
burden
would
be
with
respect
to
accounting
rules.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make
any
difference
if
the
argument
is
which
is
what
i
understood
it
to
be,
that
you
can't
regulate
at
all?
it's
not
simply
that
you
can't
regulate
so
long
as
it's
particularly
burdensome,
but
you
don't
have
the
authority
to
regulate
in
this
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
gets
to
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
gets
to
the
spending
clause
question.
we're
not...
i
mean,
we
can
address
that
without
deciding
whether
the
regulations
are
particularly
burdensome.
you
were
saying
well,
the
accounting
thing
is
not
a
big
problem.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
it's
necessarily
spending
as
opposed
to
regulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
responsive
to
my
question.
your
point
was
well,
we
don't
know
how
burdensome
a
particular
regulation
is.
if
you
lose
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
spending
or
regulation,
we
don't
have
to
wait
to
see
how
burdensome
it
is
if
we
think
you're
not
entitled
to
regulate
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
getting
back
to
the
spending
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
putting
that
aside.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
regardless
of
whether...
regardless
of
whether
it's
burdensome
regulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it's
regulation
why
isn't
that
appropriate
to
deal
with
on
summary
judgment.
not
the
spending
question
we
have...
that's
a
different
issue.
but
if
there
is
no
difference
with
respect
to
regulation
whether
it's
burdensome
or
not,
so
we
don't
have
to
have
further
proceedings
on
whether
it's
burdensome.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldsmith,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
lyng
case
that
mr.
gottesman
cited
in
response
to
that
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
lyng
said
that
the...
that
congress
was
being
neutral
not
that
it
was
making
a
choice
on
how
to
spend
its
funds.
and
i
understood
mr.
gottesman's
point
to
be
that
so
too,
here,
california
is
being
neutral.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
goldsmith.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
stevens
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-939,
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
versus
brown.
