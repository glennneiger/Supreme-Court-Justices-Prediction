justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
why
you
characterize
california
as
financing
one
side
of
a
debate,
because...
and
this
i
think
is
sort
of
the
nub
of
the
disagreement
between
the
two
sides
here...
their
argument
is
that
a
state
can
determine
what
it
wants
to
buy
with
its
money,
but
what
california
is
doing
is
telling
its
contractor
what
it
can
do
with
the
money
after
the
state
has
got
what
it
paid
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
understand
that
is
the
basic
distinction
between
a
case
like
rust
and
a
case
like
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
trying
to
control
their
profits
as
opposed
to
determining
what
they
get...
what
you
get
for
your
money.
and
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
case
in
which
california
claims
that
it
has
not
gotten
the
service
that
it
paid
for
as
a
result
of
the
position
which
an
employer...
a
grantee
employer
took
on...
on
a
unionization
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
say
"while
they
are
still
state
funds.
"
--the...
the
money
that
the...
that
any
employer
is
using,
i
presume,
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
identified,
is
money
in
the
employer's
pocket.
and
the
only
claim
that
california
would
have,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
pre-emption
argument,
is
that
in
fact
we
are
buying
a
form
of
speech
or
a
form
of
promotion
of
labor
policy
when
we
contract
with
social
service
agencies
or
whatnot.
but
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
california's
argument
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
they
give
them
grant
money...
let's
say
it's
a
grant
rather
than
a
contract,
and
i
assume
that's,
you
know,
the
point
you're
making.
when
they
give
them
grant
money,
i
assume
they're
giving
them
grant
money
in
order
to
do
or
to
perform
whatever
kind
of
service
or
function
the
agency
is
devoted
to
performing.
justice
david
h.
souter
not
to...
not
to
enforce
labor
policy
of
one
sort
or
another,
but
to
promote
the
arts
or
conservation
or
whatever
the
organization
does.
and
there's
no
argument
here
that
the
organization
is...
is
failing
to
promote
conservation
or
the
arts
or
whatever,
and
that
for
that
reason,
california
isn't
getting
what
it's
paying
for.
the
argument
is
that
whatever
california
has
to...
i'm
sorry,
whatever
the
organization
has
to
spend,
say,
on
its
labor
relations,
which
is
something
that
is
left
over
from
its
promotion
of
the
arts,
cannot
be
spent
except
in
accordance
with
california
policy.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
i
assume
they
are
entitled
to
some
overhead
cost
which
would
include
the
cost
of
their
employee-related...
managing
employee
relations?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
wouldn't
be
money
left
over.
that
would--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so,
is
the
argument
that
the
employer
in
fact...
that
the
employer
is
in
fact
devoting
less
of
the
grant
money
to
the
purpose
of
the
grant,
so
that
it
falls
within
rust?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
that...
then
that,
it
seems
to
me,
cuts
the
feet
off
your
argument
of
a
moment
ago,
that
in
fact
the
state's
concern
is
that
it's
getting
less
of
what
it
thought
it
was
getting
for
with
its
grant,
because
more
is
being
spent
on
labor
policy.
and
now,
it
seems
to
me,
you're
saying
no,
that's
not
the
case.
it
is
simply
the
fact
that
the
time
that
the
employer
spends
in
talking
with
employees,
whatever
the
subject
is,
involves
a
policy
that
california
does
not
want
to
support,
and,
therefore,
california
prohibits
them
spending
that
time
for
purely
policy
reasons.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
argument
a
moment
ago
is
that
they
were
using
the
state's
money
because
in
fact
they
were
providing
less
of
the
service
that
the
grant
was
for
and
spending
that
in...
in
conversation
with
employees
about
labor
unions.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
inconsistent
with
that.
your
answer
to
justice
scalia,
as
i
understood
it,
was
it
is
simply
that
they
do
not
want
that
policy
being
implemented
by
anyone
who
gets
any
money
from
the
state
within
that
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
argument,
there
is
no
"your
own
money".
you're
saying
that
everything
that
the
grantee
gets
in
a
grant
situation
is
the
government's
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
distinction
that
you
just
made
in
answer
to
justice
scalia
could
not
be
drawn.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
the
hypothesis
of
this
whole
argument
is
that
we
are
talking
with
a
grantee
who
was
fully
funded
by...
i
thought
fully
funded
by
the
state,
and
i
thought
that
was
your
strongest
argument.
so
that
this
alternative...
well,
you
can
use
your
own
money...
is
an
alternative
which,
you
know,
by
the
very
hypothesis
that
we
are
arguing
on,
will
never
exist.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
situation
in
which
the
contract
runs
for
a
year
and
you
bill
monthly?
on
your
theory
the
contract
is
still
going
on
and
yet
there
is
no
prepayment.
i
assume
on
your
argument
they
would
be
just
as
bound
by
the
california
policy
as
if
they
got
a
hundred
percent
payment
up
front.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
concede
that
if
they...
if
all
they
did
under
a
12-month
contract
was...
was
bill
for
services
rendered
every
past
30
days,
that
there
would
be
either
no
application
of
the
california
law
or
that
the
application
would
be
pre-empted?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
like
saying
yes.
