mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
labor
relations
act
manifests
congressional
intent
to
encourage
free
debate
on
issues
dividing
labor
and
management.
state
laws
that
restrict
speech
regarding
unionization
frustrate
that
fundamental
national
policy
and
are
therefore
pre-empted,
as
this
court
held
in
linn.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
first
of
all,
obviously,
your
honor,
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
constrain
congress'
ability
to
impose
particular
restrictions.
it
does
constrain
the
state's
ability
to
use
their
spending
power
to
regulate,
as
this
court
held
in
gould
and
in
nash.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
court
has
identified
several
factors
that
it
has
used
to
distinguish
regulatory
from
proprietary
conduct,
first
and
foremost,
as
this
court
said
in
boston
harbor.
it
looks
to
whether
the
state
is
acting
in
order
to
effectuate
policy
or
is
instead
seeking
to
achieve
cost
savings
program
efficiency
and
the
like.
in
addition,
the
court
looks
to
whether
the
measure--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
of
course,
that
question
did
not
come
up
in
rust
against
sullivan
because
there
was
in
a
nlra
pre-emption
issue
there,
and
the
question
that
the
state
was--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--but
what
the
court
did
say
in
rust
is
that
the
government
has
a
legitimate
policy
interest
in
advancing
its
preference
for
life,
in
that
case,
that
the
congress
was
entitled
to
advance.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
policy
interest
that
the
state
is
advancing,
a
policy
interest
that
says
employer
speech
regarding
unionization
interferes
with
employee
free
choice,
is
a
policy
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
federal
policy
under
the
act
as
congress
and
the
board
have
repeatedly
recognized,
and
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized.
so,
there
is
no
legitimate
interest
supporting
what
the
state
is
doing
here,
it's
an
interest
directly
contrary
to
federal
policy,
unlike
in
rust
and
other
first
amendment
cases.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
if
the...
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case
points
to
a
rule
that
the
state
has
adopted
recently
apparently
in
the
medi-cal
context,
which
says
that
they
will
only
reimburse
administrative
costs
of
hospitals
up
to
the
50th
percentile
of
costs
incurred
by
similar
facilities.
that's
obviously
not
attempting
to
regulate
any
particular
labor
speech
or
any
other
type
of
conduct.
it's
simply
saying
we
are
only
going
to
regulate
this
category,
this
broad
general
category
of
costs
to
a
certain
level.
it's
not
targeted
at
a
specific
category
of
disfavored
speech
because
the
state
disfavors
that
speech.
it's
simply
attempting
to
save
money.
that
clearly
would
not
be
pre-empted,
even
though
it
might
have
a
disproportionate
impact
on
a
particular
hospital
that's
engaged
in
a
costly--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--justice
breyer,
i
think...
i'm
assuming
in
your
hypothetical
that
this
hypothetical
law,
in
addition
to
posing
no
administrative
burdens
also
doesn't
have
the
strict
liability
of
treble
damages.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
justice
breyer--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--obviously
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
a
very
different
case
in
the
sense
that
in
this
case
it's...
from
every
one
of
the
factors
that
this
court
has
looked
to,
to
determine
regulatory
versus
proprietary...
and
this
case
cuts
fairly
in
favor
of
the
conclusion
of
the
unanimous
court
of
appeals,
all
15
judges,
that
this
is
regulatory.
it's
punitive;
it's
government-wide;
it's
not
program...
or
contract-specific;
it's
not
the
kind
of
conduct
that
private
entities
engage
in.
all
of
the
factors...
and
it's
expressly
as
well
as
obviously,
in
effect,
intended
to
disfavor
a
particular
kind
of
speech
that
congress
favors.
so
everything
cuts
in
favor
of
it
being
regulatory;
whereas,
in
your
hypothetical,
most
of
those
considerations
would
not.
however,
i
think
it's
still
the
case
that
in
that
hypothetical,
what
the
state
is
doing
is
regulating...
for
labor
policy
reasons
it's
disfavoring
a
particular
type
of
speech.
the
state
does
not
have
any
obligation
under
the
act
to
fund
unionization
speech,
but
what
it
can't
do
under
the
act
is
deny
a
government
benefit
because
of
a...
a
labor
policy.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
nash.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
i
think
it
would
be.
but,
again--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well...
i
took
your...
the
utah
example
to
be
one
where
the
state
was
somehow
mandating
this
particular
expenditure.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
if
the
state
is
simply...
is
not
taking...
is
taking
a
hands-off
approach,
it's
hard
to
characterize
it
as
regulation.
but
what
this
court
held
in
nash,
what
this
court
held
in
gould,
what
this
court
held
in
livadas
is,
when
the
state
is
denying
benefits...
even
though
there
might
be
plenty
of
legitimate
reasons
that
might
enable
it
to
deny
benefits...
if
it's
denying
benefits
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
labor
policy
in
an
area
where
congress
has
said
there
is
to
be
no
regulation,
that's
pre-empted,
and
that's
doubly
pre-empted
here
where
the
labor
policy
that
the
state
is
advancing
is
directly
contrary
to
the
federal
labor
policy
that
congress
and
the
board
have
enunciated.
and
with
respect
to
the
facial
versus
as-applied
or
the
suggestion
that
somehow
because
you
might
be
able
to
craft
a
statute
that
would
achieve
some
of
the
effects
of
this
statute
in
a
nonpre-empted
way,
that
doesn't
make
this
statute
not
facially
pre-empted.
this
statute
has
the
punitive
provisions
with
the
strict
liability,
treble
damages,
the
segregation
requirement
that's
virtually
impossible
to
apply
in
practice,
the
clear
expressive
mission
of
a
regulatory
policy
that's
contrary
to
federal
policy.
this
is
the
statute
that
is
in
front
of
the
court.
this
is
the
statute
that
is
facially
unconstitutional,
and
that's
the
issue
that
the
court
should
decide
in
order
to
correct
the
ninth
circuit's
error,
which
said
it's
both
facially
and
as
applied
immune
from
pre-emption
challenge
before
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--your
honor,
california
did
not
copy
any
federal
statutes.
none
of
the
federal
statutes
has
a
segregation
requirement;
none
of
them
imposes
strict
liability,
punitive
damages.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
there
are
three
federal
statutes
that
impose
use
restrictions.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's
not
clear
why
they
did
that,
other
than
obviously
they
were
choosing
not
to
compensate
those
particular
kinds
of
costs
as
well
as
the
others.
congress
is
entitled
to
carve
out
particular
exceptions
to
the
general
nonregulatory
provisions
of
the
act,
just
as
it
has
done
in
section
8(c),
where
they
have
carved
out
coercive
employer
and
union
speech
for
regulation,
even
though
other
speech
is
to
be
unregulated.
it's
important
to
understand
also
that
the
general
policy
in
federal
grant
programs
is
to
the
contrary.
there
is
no
such
restriction
in
the
vast
majority
of
federal
grant
programs
involving
the
vast
majority
of
federal
grant
money.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it's
not
contrary
to
national
labor
relations
policy,
because
congress
has
chosen
to
create
an
exception,
and
it
has
the
right
to
do
so;
the
state
does
not.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
in...
in
a
specific
program--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--which
obviously
the
state's
law
does
not
apply
to
those
programs;
it
applies
to
state
spending
across
the
board.
thank
you.
