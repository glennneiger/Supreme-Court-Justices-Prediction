mr.
waxman,
what
do
you
do
about
the
language
"otherwise
prohibited"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
do
about
that
language
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
that,
there's
a
question
about
not
merely
statistical
disparity,
but
a
causal
connection
between
an
identified
practice--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
disparity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman,
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
they
are
not
just
showing
a
disparate
impact.
because
of
a
particular
practice
there
is
a
disparate
impact.
that's
what
you
leave
out.
so
the
quality
of
the
practice
is
what
is
at
issue,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
come
in
and
say
i
admit
that
it
was
unlawful.
he
first
tries
to
prove
it
was
necessary,
and
he
fails
on
that.
and
if
he
fails
on
that,
he
has
the
lesser
burden
of
proving
reasonableness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
here
we
have
a
jury
verdict
that
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wasn't
the
issue
of
reasonable
factor
under
age
tried
in
the
trial
court
when
the
case
was
tried?
justice
john
paul
stevens
am
i
correct
to
understand
that
your
trial
counsel
then
took
the
position
you
must
prove
business
necessity?
i
mean
an
absence
of
business
necessity,
rather
than
reasonableness.
they
didn't
advance
their
strongest
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
everybody
now
knows,
that
was
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
you
plead
this
as
an
affirmative
defense?
did
you
plead
it
as
an
affirmative
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
he
put
in
all
the
evidence
he's
described,
that
would
not
have
proven
business
necessity.
it
seems
to
me
that
evidence
had
to
go
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
he
arguing
that
it
was
necessary
to
follow
this
one
downsizing
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
just
one
other
detail,
did...
the
district
judge
not
instruct
the
jury
on
this
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
an
unusual
case
where
the
decisive
issue,
at
least
when
you
get
to
this
court,
is
something
the
jury
never
passed
on.
