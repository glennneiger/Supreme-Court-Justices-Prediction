we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-1505,
meacham
versus
knolls
atomic
power
laboratory.
mr.
russell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
friend,
of
course,
makes
the
point
that
the
age
discrimination
prohibition
is
narrower
in
scope
than
title
vii,
that
there
are
more
likely
to
be
instances
in
which
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
came
into
play
than
there
would
be
a
basis
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
facts...
i
mean,
given
discovery,
that
doesn't
seem
a
very
compelling
case.
once
you
require
the
employer
to
come
up...
in
other
words,
the
burden
of
production...
and
say,
well,
the
reason
we
did
it
was
this,
then
it's
just
a
matter
of
discovery.
the
plaintiff
can
say,
oh,
well,
then
let
me
depose
that
person
who
is
the
head
of,
you
know,
whatever
the
department.
if
it's
for
safety
reasons,
for
some
reason,
or
training
issues,
well,
then
we
depose
the
person
who
is
in
charge
of
training
or
safety
and
ask
them
those
questions.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
fact
that
the
employer
possesses
the
information,
given
very
liberal
discovery
we
have,
is
much
of
a
factor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
joseffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
these
are
not
words.
they
are
operative
provisions
of
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
was
surprised
not
to
see
chevron
cited
in
your
brief.
what...
what
sort
of
deference
do
you
think
we
should
give
the
eeoc
regulations
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
auer
deference
tells
you
how
to
interpret
the
regulation.
and
having
once
interpreted
the
regulation,
you
need
to
know
what
to
do
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
know
what
the
regulation...
we
give
it
deference;
we
know
what
the
regulation
means.
now,
does
that
regulation,
as
understood
in
light
of
auer
deference,
get
chevron
deference
or
something
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
proving
a
negative?
they
would
just
have
to
prove
that
it
was
or
was
not
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
he
is
not...
he
didn't
do
it
to
discriminate
against
old
people.
he
did
it
because
the
foreign
country
requires
him--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--counsel,
is
your
recent
discussion
about
what
happened
here
go
simply
to,
i
guess,
your
alternative
argument,
that
we
should
affirm
because
you're
right,
regardless
of
who
bears
the
burden;
or
does
it
really
go
to
the
legal
question
before
us?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
russell,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
souter
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
06-1505,
meacham
versus
knolls
atomic
power
laboratory.
