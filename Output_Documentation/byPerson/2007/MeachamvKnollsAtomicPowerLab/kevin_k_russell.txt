mr.
kevin
k.
russell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
single
important
but
narrow
question.
everyone
agrees
that
under
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision
of
the
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
a
business
practice
that
is
reasonable
is
not
unlawful
even
if
it
has
a
disparate
impact
on
older
workers.
the
question
here
is
simply
what
happens
in
cases
in
which
the
proof
on
reasonableness
is
in
equipoise,
which
party
bears
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion.
and
on
that
question
the
statute
is
not
silent
such
as
to
leave
to
the
courts
to
decide
for
themselves
what
answer
makes
the
most
sense.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
this
court
made
quite
clear
in
city
of
jackson
that
the
existence
of
alternatives,
while
sufficient
perhaps
to
satisfy
wards
cove
and
to
show
a
violation
under
section
4(a)(2),
is
not
sufficient
to
show
that
the
action
is
unreasonable.
and
that's
what
the
court
found
to
be
the
case
in
smith.
so
the
standards
are,
in
fact,
quite
different.
the
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
provision
looks
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
actual,
existing
practice,
and
that's
where
the
"because
of
age"
refers
to
the
business
practice
there.
it
doesn't--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
is
in
our
view
necessary
in
order
to
decide
whether
there
is
a--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--it
is
necessary
in
order
to
establish
whether
you
even
get
to
the
rfoa
provision.
by
its
terms--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--even
get
to
it,
because
by
its
terms
the
rfoa
provision
only
applies
to
conduct
that
is
otherwise
prohibited
by
section
4(a)(2),
and
the
test
for
whether
something
is
otherwise
prohibited
under
section
4(a)(2)
is
wards
cove.
this
court
in
smith
said
that
language,
which
was
identical
to
the
language
congress
used
to
describe
the
unlawful-employment
practice
in
title
vii,
has
the
same
meaning
in
both
statutes.
and
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
wards
cove,
you
do
have
to
often
look
at
questions
of
alternatives.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
we
think
that
the
layering
of
the
tests
arises
out
of
the
structure
of
the
statute
as
congress
wrote
it.
if
this
court
disagrees
with
us,
however,
and
thinks
that
there
is
room
in
the
statutory
language
to
treat
the
language
of
4(a)(2)
differently
in
some
sense
or
to
apply
a
different
wards
cove
test,
then
you're
still
left
with
the
question
of
who
bears
the
burden
of
reasonableness.
and
on
that
grounds
we
agree
entirely
with
the
eeoc
that
that
question
is
still
determined
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
makes
quite
clear
that
congress
thought
that
this
was
an
exception
to
liability
upon
which
the
employer
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
and
it
made
that...
made
that
clear
both
by
setting
the
rfoa
up
as
an
exception
to
liability,
which
this
court
has
long
told
congress
will
be
construed
as
establishing
an
affirmative
defense
absent
strong
indications
of
contrary
legislative
intent,
and
by
sandwiching
that
defense
in
the
same
sentence
as
two
other
affirmative
defenses,
which
would
be
a
very
strange
thing
to
do
if
congress
in
fact
intended
the
courts
to
figure
out,
you
know,
one
of
the
three
is
not
like
the
others,
that
it's
intended,
instead,
as
a
modification
of
the
definition.
and,
third,
congress
i
think
it...
it
does,
and
it
is
telling
that,
in
defining
the
unlawful
employment
practice,
that
is
in
defining
the
plaintiff's
case
in
chief,
congress
used
the
same
language
that
it
did
in
title
vii,
and
this
court
has
never
construed
that
language
to
require
proof
of
unreasonableness.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
we
acknowledge
that.
this
court
pointed
out
in
smith
that
congress
itself
recognized
that
there
was
a
difference
between
age
and
other
kinds
of
discrimination;
but
it
took
that
difference
into
account
not
by
defining
the
unlawful
employment
practice
differently,
but
by
providing
age
discrimination
defendants
a
capacious
defense
that's
not
available
to
any
other
defendant
in
a
federal
employment
discrimination
statute,
and
by
in
1991
not
extending
the
modifications
to
wards
cove
to
adea
plaintiffs.
congress
already
specifically
addressed
this
question
of
whether
wards
cove
should
be
adjusted
in
order
to
make
age
discrimination
claims
harder
to
prove
than
title
vii
claims,
and
it
agreed
that
it
should;
but
it
didn't
do
it
in
the
way
that
respondents
suggest.
instead
they
lowered
the
bar
for
title
vii
plaintiffs
and
left
in
place
the
wards
cove
test
for
age
discrimination.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
think
it
does.
we
use
the
example
in
our
brief
of
a
weight-lifting
requirement.
it's
quite
possible
for
that
requirement,
and
quite
likely,
that
it
will
have
a
disparate
impact
on
older
workers
because
of
their
age.
the
effect
will
be
felt
by
workers
because
of
their
age.
at
the
same
time,
it
is
quite
possible
that
that
practice
itself
will
be
entirely
reasonable.
and
the
difference
is
between
what
the
"because
of
age"
refers
to
in
the
two
different
provisions.
so
if
you
look
on
page
3
of
the
blue
brief,
you
have
the
language
of
the
rfoa
provision,
and
the
reasonable...
the
"factors
other
than
age"
refers
to
in
that
case
the
differentiation,
that
is
the
business
practice
itself.
but
if
you
turn
to
the
prior
page
on
page
1a
and
look
at
the
language
of
(a)(2),
the
business
practice,
that
is,
the
limiting,
segregating,
or
classifying,
doesn't
have
to
be
because
of
age.
there
wouldn't
be
a
disparate
treatment
claim.
instead
what
"because
of
age"
refers
to
there
is
the
effect
of
that
facially
neutral
practice.
that
is,
the
employee
has
to
show
that
the
neutral
practice
deprives
or
tends
to
deprive
people
of
opportunities
because
of
their
age.
and
the
way
that
you
do
that
is
through
the
first
step
of
the
wards
cove
analysis,
by
showing
that
the
practice
falls
more
heavily
on
older
workers
as
a
group,
so
that
you
can
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff
is
feeling
the
effect
because
of
her
age
as
opposed
to
because
of
her
sex
or
some
other
reason
specific
to
her.
so
it's
not
the
fact
that
a
showing
of
rfoa
negates
the
showing
that
a
disparate
impact
is
felt
because
of
age
by
the
plaintiff.
as
we
were...
as
i
was
mentioning
before,
the
language
of
the
statute
we
think
strongly
points
in
favor
of
an
ordinary
reading
of
this
as
an
affirmative
defense.
the
respondent's
principal
objection
is
that
this
doesn't
give
adequate
weight
to
the
differences
between
age
and
other
forms
of
discrimination.
but
as
i
mentioned,
we...
we
do
think
that
congress
took
that
into
account
in
a
different
way,
and
there
is,
we
think,
quite
an
important
value
here
in
providing
congress
clear
rules
of
interpretation
so
that
it
knows
when
it
enacts
statutes
using
a
particular
formulation
the
courts
will
construe
it
in
an
ordinary
way,
absent
some
compelling
indication
to
the
contrary.
we
recognize,
of
course,
in
betts
that
this
court
found
such
a
compelling
counter-indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute,
and
in
the...
the
law's
traditional
treatment
of
benefits...
retirement
benefits
and
seniority
rights.
but
respondents
can't
point
to
any
kind
of
similar
showing
in
this
case
that
congress
would
have
intended
this
catch-all
provision
to
mean
something
other
than
what
it
seems
to
say.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
certainly
what
you
have
to
show
before
you
get
to
the
defense
is
different
in
the
two
statutes.
they
are
similar
in
the
sense
that
neither
requires
proof
of
intentional
discrimination.
for
example,
in
corning
glass
works
all
the
plaintiffs
showed
there
was
that
a
facially
neutral
practice,
that
is
paying
the
night
shift
folks
more
than
the
day
shift
folks,
resulted
in
women
getting
paid
less
than
men
for
the
same
work,
and
that
was
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
over
to
the
employer
to
show
that
it
was
based
on
any
other
factor
other
than
age.
and
in
here
we
think
that
it's
similar,
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
a
neutral
employment
practice
has
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
age.
we
think
in
our
view,
in
addition,
the
plaintiff
has
to
make
the
full
wards
cove
showing
that
would
be
sufficient
in
title
vii
to
establish
liability
conclusively.
and
at
that
point,
then
the
burden
does
shift
to
the
employer
but
it's
a
modest
burden.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
well.
we
think
that
this
is--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
we
think
there
are
some
difficulties,
but
it's
ultimately
i
think
beside
the
point.
the
question
is
not
what
rule
would
make
sense,
but
what
does
the
statute...
what
rule
does
the
statute
contemplate?
and
we
think
by
phrasing
the
rfoa
provision
as
a
traditional
affirmative
defense--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
think
the
statute
makes
perfect
sense
the
way
it's
written,
but
if
you
disagree--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--the
foreign
law
exception.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes,
we
think
it
would
be
entirely
odd
for
congress--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--i
don't
think
it's
beyond
the
employee's
means.
i
don't
think
it's
an
impossible
burden.
certainly
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
in
a
way
that
imposed
that
burden
on
the
employees.
we
do
think
that
it
makes
sense
because...
that
the
factors
that
weigh
in
on
the
reasonableness
tend
to
be
in
the
employer's
possession
and
they
have
better
access
to
it;
it
makes
sense
for
them
to
bear
the
burden.
but
ultimately
our
argument
isn't
grounded
on
the
claim
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
congress
to
have
imposed
that
burden.
it's
grounded
on
the
claim
that
the
text
of
the
statute
indicates
that
congress
made
a
different
decision,
that
is
it
accommodated
the
employers'
interests
in
dealing
with
the
special
facts
of
age
discrimination
differently.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
is.
and
my
answer
is
that
we
do
think
that
most
of
the
facts
going
to
reasonableness
are
in
the
employer's
possession.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
well,
that's
true
in
every
case
in
which
informational
disadvantages
are
cited
as
a
reason
for
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
one
party
or
the
other.
discovery
can
always
mitigate
that
disadvantage.
but
we
ultimately
think,
you
know,
if
you
find
the
statute
so
ambiguous
as
to
think
that
it's
a
really
critical
consideration
of
what
makes
the
most
sense,
then
you
ought
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
the
eeoc
on
this
question.
i
would
like
to
address
if
i
could
one
specific--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
it's
certainly
clear
that
the
eeoc...
what
their
position
is,
and
that
they
read
their
regulation
as
addressing
disparate
impact;
and
we
think
that,
although
it's
an
inartfully
drafted
regulation,
by
using
the
terms
"individual
claim
of
discriminatory
treatment"
rather
than
the
term
of
art
"disparate
treatment",
the
language
is
broad
enough
to
bear
their
reading,
particularly
when
you
see
that
it
was
enacted
in
the
aftermath
of
a
department
of
labor
regulation
that
nobody
disputes
addresses
disparate-impact
cases,
and
it
has
no
indication
that
they
were
disavowing
that
position.
but
if
i
could
address
the
one
other
objective--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i...
i
think
that
the
terms
of
art
are
"adverse
impact"
and
"disparate
treatment".
and
so
that
their
failure
to
use
either
one
of
those,
i
think,
supports
the
idea
that
they
weren't
talking
about
either
one
specifically.
i
agree,
it's...
it's
a
hard
to
read
regulation.
but
if
i
could
turn,
for
a
moment,
to
the
adams
fruit
objection,
which
is
respondent's
insistence
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
question
that
the
court
should
defer
to
an
agency
on.
my
point
is
simply
that
this
is
a
substantive
question
of
law.
it's
a
question
of
whether
reasonableness
is
an
element
of
the
unlawful
employment
practice
in
section
4(a)(2),
the
same
kind
of
question
this
court
asked
in
smith
when
it
decided
whether
discriminatory
intent
was
an
element
of
the
4(a)(2)
cause
of
action.
and
the...
congress
has
delegated
authority
to
the
eeoc
to
address
those
kinds
of
questions.
in
fact,
it
went
so
far
as
to
delegate
to
the
authority...
delegate
to
the
eeoc
the
authority
not
only
to
construe
the
exceptions
that
are
in
the
act,
but
to
create
additional
exceptions.
so
i
think
congress
would
be
very
surprised,
indeed,
to
find
out
that
this
is
not
the
sort
of
question
to
which
it
had
delegated
authority
to
the
eeoc
to
answer.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
general
legal
question
that
the
court
granted
cert
on,
and
particularly
going
back
to
this
idea,
this
assertion
that
the
proof
of
the
rfoa
is
somehow
a
negation
of
the
obligation
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
that
they
have
suffered
a
disparate
impact
because
of
age.
it
is
simply
incorrect.
it's
based...
as,
justice
souter,
i
think
you
were
suggesting
in
some
of
your
questions...
on
a
confusion
about
what
the
4(a)(2).
the
requirement
under
section
4(a)(2)
is
simply
to
show
that
the
effect
of
the
practice
is
felt
because
of
age,
while
the
defense
in
the
rfoa
provision
is
to
show
that
the
practice
itself
is
reasonable
even
though
it
has
this
effect.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
i
think,
under
wards
cove,
this
court
has
said
that
it
does,
and
so
under
wards
cove
you
establish
that
the
discrimination
is
felt
by
older
workers
because
of
age
by
showing
that
all
the
workers
as
a
group
suffer
disproportionately
from
it.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--but
i
think
all
you
have
to
show
under
4(a)(2)
is
that
the
practice
tends
to
disadvantage
older
workers
because
of
their
age.
and
so
again
in
our
weight...
weight
example,
the
employer
admits
in
our
weight
example
that
the
effect
of
the
neutral
practice
is
to
fall
more
heavily,
is
to
restrict
the
employment
opportunities
of
older
workers
because
of
age,
but
says,
even
if
that's
true...
even
if
there
is
a
disparate
impact
because
of
age...
we
are
still
entitled
to
the
defense
because
the
practice
itself
is
reasonable.
it's
also...
i
would
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that
griggs
is
directed...
or
disparate
impact
is
directed
at
ferreting
out
intentional
discrimination.
certainly
it
serves
that
function
in
many
cases,
but
that's
not
the
sole
purpose
of
it.
and
it's
simply
not
the
purpose
of
the
prima
facie
case
in
wards
cove
to
give
rise
to
an
inference
of
intentional
discrimination,
and
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
as
strongly
in
the
age
case
i
think
isn't
a
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
the
courts
to
develop
a
different
test
for
showing
what's
otherwise
prohibited
under
4(a)(2).
and,
finally,
if
i
could
address
some
of
the
questions
regarding
what
happened
in
this
case.
this
case,
justice
stevens,
was
not
tried
with
reasonableness
in
mind,
both
because
respondents
abandoned
their
"reasonable
factor
other
than
age"
defense,
which
they
had
raised
as
an
affirmative
defense
in
their
answer.
i
believe
mr.
waxman
is
incorrect
when
he
suggests
that
they
in
fact
asked
for
instructions.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
may
have
been
relevant
to
reasonableness,
but
that's
not
why
it
was
put
in.
before
the
trial
began--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--they
certainly,
i
think...
they
used
that
argument
to
show
that
they
had
a
business
justification
and
to
try
to
rebut
our
showing
of
alternative,
equally
effective
practices.
but
it
was
clear
by
the
time
of
trial
that...
you
know,
they
had
proposed
jury
instructions
that
didn't
ask
for
reasonableness
to
be
part
of
the
case.
we
proceeded
with
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
prevail
under
these
instructions
so
long
that
we
showed
that
the
current
practice,
reasonable
or
not,
had
a
disparate
impact
and
was
subject
to
an
equally
effective
alternative.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
it
did
not.
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
the
only
instruction
was
that
we'd
be
entitled
to
prevail
if
we
showed
wards
cove,
and
its--
mr.
kevin
k.
russell
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
and
ordinarily
i
think
you
would
say
that
the
defendants,
by
not
raising
the
issue
to
the
jury,
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense,
have
waived
it.
they
ask
for
an
excuse,
given
the
change
in
law.
we
don't
think
that
the
change
in
law
excuses
their
failure
to
waive
it.
the
regulation
that
they
point
to
they
themselves
have
argued
here
isn't
entitled
to
much
of
any
deference.
and,
in
fact,
at
the
same
time
they
were
simultaneously
arguing
that
there
wasn't
even
any
disparate-impact
liability
in
the
first
place
under
the
adea.
so
i
don't
think
they
can
actually
claim
that
they
were
relying
on
that.
thank
you.
