is
there
a
hypothetical
universe
where
a
scheme
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
age
is
reasonable,
but
there
is
another
alternative
that
doesn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age?
is
the
first
alternative
still
reasonable,
or
does
the
existence
of
a
nondiscriminating
alternative
make
it
unreasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
that's
true,
then
is
it
necessary
either
on
the
burden
of
production
or
burden
of
persuasion
aspect
of
the
case
to
consider
other
alternatives?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
necessary
in
light
of
the
answer
you
gave
me
at
the
outset?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whether
you
even
get
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
burden
of
production,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
about
the
burden
of
persuasion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
it
that
if
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
production,
and
i
assume
that
is
satisfied
by
his
saying,
here's
the
plan
that
we
used,
here
are
the
factors
we
used,
here
is
the
reason
we
used
them.
what
is
so
difficult
for
the...
what
is
the
difficulty
in
saying
that
the
employee
then
has
to
show
that
that
is
unreasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
the
statute
doesn't
make
sense,
so
we
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i'm
well
aware
of
the
statutory
format
here.
but
what
i
want
to
ask
is
why
is
it
beyond
the
employee's
means
and
capacity
to
show
that
this
is
unreasonable?
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
gravamen
of
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
i
find
the
text
of
the
statute
neutral
or
at
least
not
clear,
then
it
is
proper
for
me
to
ask
as
a
matter
of
efficiency
where
the
burden
should
be
placed,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
if
the
statute
contains
three
different
conditions,
three
different
commands,
that
it
follows
that
the
procedural
implementations
for
all
of
these
has
to
be
the
same.
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
want
to
say
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
burden
of
persuasion,
burden
of
production
problems
with
affirmative
action,
then
they
wouldn't
have
drafted
it
this
way,
that's
one
thing.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
and
just
adding
on
to
the
chief
justice,
it
seems
the
employer
is
the
one
that
would
prove
the
negative.
he
has
to
say
there
were
no...
here
is
a
whole
universe
of
other
frameworks,
and
none
of
these
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
there
agree
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
"business
necessity"
and
"business
reasonableness"?
