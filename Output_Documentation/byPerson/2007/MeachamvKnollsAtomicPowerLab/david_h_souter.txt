isn't
it...
isn't
the...
isn't
the
weak
point
in
your
argument
the
following:
your
argument
assumes
that
when
the
employer
implicitly
says
i
admit
the
allegations
the
complainant
made,
that
the
employer
is
admitting,
in
effect,
to
disparate
treatment.
that
he
is
saying:
i
did
it
because
it
was
my
purpose
to
discriminate
against
the
old.
but
if
we
read
the
"because"
language
as
also
admitting
the
meaning,
"i
did
it
or
it
had
an
impact
by
reason
of
the
age,
regardless
of
my
intent.
"
then
this
incongruity
that
you
are
arguing
about
disappears.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
the
old.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's...
that's
disparate
treatment.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
an
impact...
no.
in
an
impact
case,
he
is
saying:
i
admit
that
the
impact
falls
more
heavily
on
the
old.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
he
has
to
admit
in
an
impact
case.
and
he
does
so,
and
then
he--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
then
you're...
then
you're
just
saying
that
there...
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
disparate-impact
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
there's
got
to
be
a
disparate-treatment
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
i'm
not
following
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
wards
cove,
in
other
words,
says
"because"
may
mean
"correlation"
and
it
mean
"purpose",
either
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
of
the
second
circuit.
the
nation's
fleet
of
nuclear-powered
submarines
is
maintained
in
part
by
the
government's
private
contractors.
one
such
contractor,
knolls,
the
respondent
here,
runs
a
government
laboratory.
as
the
cold
war
wound
down
in
the
1990s,
the
government
ordered
knolls
to
cut
its
workforce.
knolls
laid
off
31
salaried
employees
of
whom
30
were
at
least
40
years
old,
old
enough
to
be
covered
by
the
federal
age
discrimination
in
employment
act,
the
adea
which
was
also
the
subject
of
justice
breyer's
kentucky
opinion
a
moment
ago.
the
petitioners
including
clifford
meacham
were
among
those
workers
laid
off.
they
sued
under
the
adea
and
won
a
jury
verdict
on
their
claim
that
knolls'
lay
off
procedures
had
a
disparate
impact
that
is
a
discriminatory
effect
on
older
workers.
but
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
ruled
in
favor
of
knolls
saying
that
meacham
and
the
other
plaintiffs
had
not
satisfied
the
burden
of
persuasion
in
rebutting
the
defense,
that
the
criteria
knolls
used
in
its
lay
off
decisions
were
reasonable
ones.
that
defense
is
laid
out
in
the
section
4
(f)
(1)
of
the
adea
which
says
that
--
and
i
am
quoting,
“it
shall
not
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
take
any
action
otherwise
prohibited
by
the
act,
where
the
differentiation
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.”
this
is
referred
to
as
the
rfoa
defense.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
employer
bears
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
to
raise
this
defense.
we
granted
certiorari
to
answer
only
the
question
whether
the
employer
also
bears
the
burden
of
persuading
the
fact
finder
on
the
merits
of
the
defense,
or
whether
as
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
task
falls
to
the
employee.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
vacate
and
remand.
we
hold
that
an
employer
looking
to
take
advantage
of
the
rfoa
exemption
bears
not
only
the
burden
of
production,
but
also
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
defense.
most
lawyers
would
find
this
to
be
no
surprise.
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
the
rfoa
clause
sits
in
a
provision
not
only
separate
from
the
ones
that
create
liability,
but
one
that
also
refers
to
the
conduct
that
exempts
as
actions
otherwise
prohibited
by
the
act.
a
familiar
principle
in
reading
statutes
tells
us
in
the
words
of
justice
holmes,
that
“when
a
proviso
carves
an
exception
out
of
the
body
of
a
statute,
those
who
set
up
the
exception
must
prove
it.”
this
longstanding
convention
is
a
part
of
the
backdrop
against
which
the
congress
writes
its
laws
and
so
we
follow
it,
too,
unless
we
see
clear
signs
that
congress
meant
the
opposite.
in
fact,
our
past
cases
have
already
recognized
that
the
clause
right
next
to
the
rfoa
clause
creates
an
affirmative
defense
with
the
burden
of
persuasion
falling
on
the
employer,
and
in
this
case
we
have
been
given
no
good
reason
to
treat
the
rfoa
clause
any
differently.
in
going
the
other
way,
the
court
of
appeals
took
its
queue
from
the
employee's
burden
of
persuasion
on
the
question
of
whether
an
employer's
practice
is
a
business
necessity,
a
tests
the
courts
had
applied
under
title
vii
before
it
was
amended
in
1991.
but
the
business
necessity
test
has
no
use
in
adea
disparate
impact
cases
where
it
would
be
largely
redundant
and
in
some
ways
incompatible
with
the
statutory
rfoa
defense.
and
because
our
prior
cases
about
the
business
necessity
test
have
nothing
to
do
with
statutory
defenses
either
in
the
old
title
vii
or
--
or
in
the
adea,
they
do
not
disturb
our
natural
reading
of
the
rfoa
clause
as
creating
an
affirmative
defense.
for
these
reasons,
we
vacate
the
second
circuit's
opinion
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
