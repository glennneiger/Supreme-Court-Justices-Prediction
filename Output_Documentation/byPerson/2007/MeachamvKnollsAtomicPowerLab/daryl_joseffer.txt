mr.
daryl
joseffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
adea
against
a
settled
background
rule
that
defendants
bear
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
affirmative
defenses
and
other
exceptions
to
liability.
and
congress
made
very
clear
in
the
statute
that
the
"reasonable
factors
other
than
age"
provision
is
precisely
such
an
affirmative
defense.
it
did
so
first
by
saying
that
the
provision
applies
to
activities
that
are
"otherwise
prohibited
by
subsection
a".
that
has
to
mean
that
liability
for
disparate
impacts
exists
under
subsection
a
without
regard
to
whether
the
employment
practice
is
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
the
latter
inquiry
is
then
a
defense
to
the
liability
that
would
a.
the
second
is
a
point
that
justice
ginsburg
made,
which
is
that
this
subsection
(f)(1)
lists
three
different
defenses
right
in
a
row.
it
appears
to
be
common
ground
that
the
other
two
are
clearly
affirmative
defenses
as
to
which
the
employer
bears
the
burden
of
persuasion.
and
considering
that
all
three
are
introduced
by
the
same
"otherwise
prohibited"
language
and
they
are
set
forth
in
a
single
sentence
separated
only
by
commas,
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
among
them.
now,
the
defendant's
main
argument
seems--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no.
i
mean,
it's
just
a
matter
of
how
to
interpret
the
particular
statute.
and
since
our
point
here
is
that
this
is
a
subsection
on
its
face--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
exactly.
i
mean,
words
are
generally
known
by
the
company
they
keep.
and
with
these
three
in
a
row,
it
would
presumptively
assume
that
they
are
all--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right.
they
are
three
separate
clauses
that
are
set
forth,
introduced
by
the
same,
in
our
view,
dispositive
language,
which
is
the
"otherwise
prohibited"
phrase.
it's
also
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
because
the
defendant's
view
seems
to
be
that
(a)(2)
and
(f)(1),
should
essentially
be
conflated
such
that
the
second,
more
specific
provision
is
essentially
surplusage.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
it
modifies...
it
modifies
something
different.
"based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
"
modifies
the
underlying
employment
practice,
the
differentiation.
over
an
(a)(2)...
and
this
was
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
in
smith
in
part...
"because
of"
does
not
modify
the
underlying
employment
practice.
it
modifies
the
adverse
effect
of
the
unemployment
practice.
in
other
words,
the
statute
refers
to...
and
this
is
on
page
1a
of
the
blue
brief
appendix...
it
refers
to
an
employment
practice
such
as
a
classification
that
adversely
affects
an
individual
because
of
that
individual's
age.
so
"because
of"
logically
modifies
what
comes
before
it,
which
is
"adverse
effect".
and
that's
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
first
sentence
that
talks
about
the
employment
practices
is
written
in
the
plural,
whereas
6
in
smith.
and
that
also
has
to
be
the
case
because
disparate
impact
liability
is
not
based
on
intent.
it
doesn't
matter
why
the
employer
draft...
has
the
employment
practice.
what
matters
is
the
effect.
so
in
any
disparate
impact
case
there
are
two
basic
inquiries:
the
first
is,
is
there
an
adverse
effect
on
the
protected
class;
and
the
second
is,
has
the
business
practice
nonetheless
justifiable.
and
here
congress
broke
those
two
out.
subsection
(a)(2)
addresses
is
there
an
adverse
effect
on
the...
on
the
protected
class.
and
then
in
(f)(1),
congress
specifically
addressed
the
justification
standard.
that's
one
reason
that
we
disagree
with
petitioners
about
their
four-part
test.
here
congress
clearly...
here
the
first
part
of
wards
cove
tells
us
whether
there
is
an
adverse
effect
under
subsection
(a)(2).
but
then
when
it
comes
to
the
justification
step,
congress
clearly
said
that
the
justification
is
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
so
there
is
no
need
to
read
in
a
different
justification
standard
from
the
second
and
third
prongs
of
wards
cove.
mr.
daryl
joseffer
i
think...
i
think
i
understand
the
question.
this
statute
is
far
more
employer-friendly
in
the
standard
than
title
vii
because
it
relies
on
the
reasonable
factors...
the
reasonableness
defense,
which
is
a
much
lower
standard
than
the
business
necessity
test
under
title
vii.
that
reflects
the
fact
that
there
are
more
innocent
explanations
for
age
disparity.
the
separate
question
here,
though,
on
burden
of
persuasion,
i
think
the
key
point
there
is
that
in
wards
cove
this
court
only
had
the
equivalent
of
(a)(2)
to
work
with.
so
it
had
not
much
textual
basis
to
go
on
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
factors
of
wards
cove
and
burden-shifting.
the
court
had
to
do
a
lot
of
gap-filling
once
it
recognized
the
disparate
impact
claim.
since
then,
however,
in
every
one
of
these
related
civil
rights
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted,
it
has
spoken
more
clearly
on
the
justification
stage;
and
has
always
in
every
one
of
these
statutes
put
that
burden
on
the
defendant.
it
did
it
in
equal
pay
act,
according
to
this
court's
decision
in
corning
glass.
it
did
it
in
the
revised
title
vii.
it
did
it
here.
and
even
in
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
congress
specified
that
business
necessity
is
a
"defense".
mr.
daryl
joseffer
auer...
in
our
view
the
regulation
itself
as
far
as
it
goes
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference,
because
it's
a
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
pursuant
to
delegated
legislative
authority.
we
recognize,
however,
that
the
regulation
on
its
face
is
at
best
inartfully
written;
and
therefore,
the
question
is
how
to
interpret
the
regulation.
we
think
eeoc's
interpretation
of
its
regulation
in
context
is
reasonable
for
a
combination
of
a
few
factors.
first,
the
department
of
labor
contemporaneously
enacted
a
regulation
putting
the
burden
on
the
employer
in
all
cases.
second,
when
the
eeoc
took
over
rulemaking
authority,
it
didn't
insert
this
unusual
discriminatory
treatment
language
in
there,
but
the
eeoc's
position
at
that
time
and
ever
since
has
been
that
it
did
not
intend
a
substantive
change.
and
third,
discriminatory
treatment,
while
it
undoubtedly
throws
a
real
wrench
in...
or
wrinkle
into
things...
excuse
me...
and
takes
us
out
of
chevron
and
into
auer,
is
not
a
term
of
art.
disparate
treatment
is
a
term
of
art.
the
regulations
otherwise
use
the
phrase
"different
treatment",
but
discriminatory
treatment
is
at
best
confusing,
especially
considering--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--my
understanding
of
auer
deference
is
that
the
agency
gets
deference
as
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
its
regulation.
and
the
agency
has
consistent--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--it
would
get
chevron
deference.
i
mean,
i
think
the
two-step
process
is
the
regulation
here,
in
our
view,
is
clearly
entitled
to
chevron
deference
as
far
as
it
goes.
and
if
you
defer
under
auer
to
the
agency's
view
of
its
regulation,
then
that
makes
the
chevron
case.
but
it's
through
the
lens
of
auer.
and
finally,
as
a
policy
matter,
justice
kennedy,
one
can
reasonably
place
this
burden
of
persuasion
either
way.
i
mean
this
court
put
it
one
place
in
wards
cove.
congress
immediately
abrogated
wards
cove
and
put
it
in
the
other
place.
the
sky
is
not
going
to
fall
either
way.
but
even
if
the
text
wasn't
so
clear,
one
would
logically
put
it
on
the
employer
for
a
few
reasons:
first,
all
else
being
equal,
the
employer
is
at
least
in
a
better
decision
to
explain
the
reasonableness
of
its
very
own
business
practice.
and,
second,
the
parties
are
not
ordinarily
expected
to
prove
a
negative,
which
is
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
do
here.
and
that's
why
in
every
statute
enacted
after
1964,
which
is
the
first--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--right,
and--
mr.
daryl
joseffer
--no,
it's
a
very
simple
two-part
test.
once
the
plaintiff
has
established
an
adverse
effect,
an
adverse
impact...
i
mean,
even
the
defendant
agrees
that
presumptively
establishes
liability,
because
the
defendant
agrees
to
bear
at
least
the
burden
of
production
at
that
point.
and
the
question
for
the
employer
is
just
to
show
that
its
business
practices...
own
business
practice
is
reasonable,
is
supported
by
some
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
and
it
ought
not
be
hard
for
an
employer,
especially
considering
that
the
reasonableness
standard
is
not
very
daunting,
to
explain
why
its
own
business
practice
is
reasonable.
and
if
an
employer
can't
even
persuade
someone
that
its
own
business
practice
is
reasonable,
then
the
odds
are
that
there
is
a
problem.
thank
you.
