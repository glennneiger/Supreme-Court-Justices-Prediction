mr.
russell,
this
is
the
problem
that
i
have
with
your
double
inquiry.
first,
you
decide
business
necessity.
then
you
decide
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
once
you
determine
that
there
is
no
business
necessity,
there
is
a
readily
available
alternative,
so
what
you're
left
with
is
a
pretext
for
age
discrimination,
what...
what
function
is
there
for
anything
else
to
perform?
i
mean,
i
understand
the
business
necessity,
whether
you
have
it
pre-1991
or
post,
but
i
don't
understand
putting
this
other
test
on
top
of
it.
it
sounds
like
you're
making
it
harder
for
the...
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
expression
comes
from
the
equal
pay
act,
with
a
substitution.
in
the
equal
pay
act
it's
"any
other
factor
other
than
sex.
"
and
here
it's
"a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
"
and
my
impression
is
that
that
formulation
in
this
equal
pay
act
has
been
rather
problematic.
first,
you
have
to
find
there
is
a
differential
between
the
pay
of
men
and
the
pay
of
women,
so...
and
then
you
go
to
any
other
factor
other
than
sex.
are
you
suggesting
any
different
analysis
for
the
age
category
than
for
the
sex
category.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
point
that
it's
sandwiched
between
two
things
that
are
clearly
affirmative
defenses,
bfoq,
the
employer
has
the
buried
of
production
and
persuasion.
and
i
forgot
what
the
third
one--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
also
an
affirmative
defense.
so
i
take
it
your
point
is
why
should
this
middle
one
be
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
argument
was
that
eeoc
never
spoke
to
disparate
impact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
problem
is
that
you
would
be
making
this
provision
more
generous
to
the
plaintiff
than...
for
example,
in
title
vii
the
defense
is
business
necessity;
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
production;
the
employee
has
the
burden
of
persuasion.
here
you'd
read...
you're
saying
you
come
into
the
covered
category,
you
were
shown
because
of
age
through
impact,
and
then
the
burden...
the
total
burden
is
on
the
employer.
am...
am
i
making
myself
clear
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
the
first
part--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
way
you
phrased
the
first
part,
it
sounded
to
me
like
you
were
going
back
to
the
interpretation
that
this
court
rejected,
that
is,
under
the
age
discrimination
act
there
is
only
differential
treatment,
not
neutral
factor
with
a
differential
impact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
still,
the
numbers,
the
way
it
came
out,
are
rather
startling.
that
there
were
31
people
who
were
rif'd;
and
of
those,
30
turn
out
to
be
over
40.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
terms
"flexibility",
"criticality"...
i
mean
the
way
you
described
it,
it
sounds
very
mechanical,
mathematical.
but
those
terms
are...
they
call
for
some
human
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
maybe
because
he
thought
that,
given
the
subjectivity
of
some
of
these
factors,
that
there
was
at
least
unconscious
age
bias
in
the
decisions
that
were
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
taken
out
of
it
by
judge
jacobs
when
he
redid
it.
he
said,
we
were
on
the
wrong
track
with
business
necessity.
business
necessity
is
out.
it's
only
reasonable
factor
of
age.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
judge
pooler
wrong,
then?
she
said,
in
effect:
you
forfeited
reasonable
factor
other
than
sex,
because
you
didn't
bring
it
up.
you
were
going
on
business
necessity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
jury
didn't
hear
a
word
about
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
they
heard
about
business
necessity.
