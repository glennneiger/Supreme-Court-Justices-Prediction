isn't
it
a
strain
to
say
that
an
employment
practice
was
because
of
an
individual's
age,
but
at
the
same
time
was
based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age?
justice

doesn't
the
latter
negate
the
former
or
come
very
close
to
negating
the
former?
and
if
that's
the
case
doesn't
that
suggest
that
it's
not
really
an
affirmative
defense
but
what's
necessary
to
show
liability?

in
this
area
of
the
law,
"treatment"
and
"impact"
are
words
that
have
tremendously
different
meaning.
isn't
it
strange
to
argue
that
they
used
the
term
"treatment"
when
they
really
meant
"impact"?

do
you
think
that
"based
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
"
in
the
adea
means
something
different
from
because
of
such...
i'm
sorry,
that
the...
because
of
an
individual's
age
in
the
adea
means
something
different
from
because
of
such
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
practice...
if
a
practice
correlates
with
a
number
of...
statistically
correlates
with
a
number
of
different
factors,
is
it
because
of
all
of
those
factors?
