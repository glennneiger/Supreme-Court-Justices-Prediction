mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
make
an
argument
both
from
elegance
and
from
function
and
from
structure.
under
the
employment
discrimination...
a
wide
range
of
employment
discrimination,
beginning
with
this
court's
decision
in
mcdonnell
douglas,
this
court
has
applied
a
three-step
balance-shifting
paradigm
in
order
to
help
juries
resolve
the
question
of
whether
discrimination
occurred.
in
the
disparate
treatment
cases
there
is
a
burden...
the
first
step,
the
plaintiff
has
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
that
he
was
the
subject
of
disparate
treatment
because
of
his
race
or
sex.
the
burden
of
production
then
shifts
to
the
defendant
in
order
to
explain,
under
disparate
treatment
cases,
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
reason,
which
eliminates
the
presumption
consistent
with
evidence
rule
301,
and
the
burden
of
proof
then
resumes
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
discrimination
because
of
the
prohibited
characteristic.
now,
in
wards
cove,
this
court
looked
both
to
rule
301
and
to
the
paradigm
in
other
discrimination
cases
to
apply
a
three-part
test,
in
which
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
to
establish
a
presumption,
a
burden
of
production
to
neutralize
it,
and
then
a
burden
of
proof
to
show
because
of
race.
the
second
circuit
has
done
exactly
that
in
this
case,
and
we
think
they
are
right
not
just
because
that
harmonizes
this
court's
prior
discrimination
cases,
and
not
just
because
three
seems
to
be
more
elegant
than
the
four
steps
that
the
petitioners
want
or
the
two
steps
that
the
government
wants,
but
because
it
makes
sense.
and
this
goes
directly
to
the
question,
i
think
it
was,
that
justice
alito
asked:
whether
or
not
the
"reasonable
factors
other
than
age"
inquiry
is
simply
what's
necessary
to
show
liability,
that
is,
that
it
was
because
of.
the
adea
doesn't
prohibit
disparate
treatment.
it
doesn't
prohibit
disparate
impact.
it
prohibits...
doesn't
prohibit
employment
practices
simply
because
they
correlate
negatively
with
age.
a
plaintiff
has
to
prove
that
he
has
suffered
adverse
employment
action
because
of
his
age.
and
the
question
whether
an
employer
based
its
action
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
is
part
and
parcel
of
that
inquiry.
it's
not
a
free-standing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--confession
and
avoidance
defense.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
not
at
all.
not
at
all.
if
i
said
that,
i
certainly
don't
want
to
be
mistaken.
we
are
not
up
here
arguing
that
there
is
no
disparate
impact
theory
of
liability
under
the
adea
as
there
is
under
title
vii.
this
court
resolved
that
question
in
smith,
and
it
resolved
it
in
large
part
by
reference
to
the
"reasonable
factors
other
than
age"
provision,
which
justice
stevens'
opinion
for
a
plurality
of
the
court
explained
that,
when
you
have
a
disparate
treatment
case,
if
the
plaintiff
proves
that
his...
his
or
her
treatment...
if
the
defendant
proves
that
it
was
because
of
something
other
than
age,
it
isn't
disparate
treatment.
the
fact
that
there
is
an
rfoa
provision,
we
think,
does
reflect
the
fact
that
there
is
the
potential
for
liability
under
disparate
impact,
but
as
this
court
explained,
it's
narrower.
and
it's
narrower
because...
not
only
because
the
1991
amendments
didn't
apply
to
age
cases;
it's
narrower,
because
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
almost
every
age
case
it
has
decided,
age...
unlike
race
and
sex
and
religion
and
national
origin...
often
does...
sad
to
say
by
somebody
who
is
in
his
second
decade
of
protection
under
the
adea...
often
does
correlate
with
reasonable
employment
factors.
and
the
fact
that
all...
what
it
means
is
that
at
step
one
of
the
burden-shifting
analysis,
the
wards
cove
analysis,
which
in
a
race
or
sex
case
establishes
a
strong
presumption
that
the
employment
action
was
because
of
race
or
sex
because
there
are
so
few
employment
characteristics
that
do
correlate
negatively
with
one's
race
or
one's
gender,
it's
a
strong
presumption
which
nonetheless
need
be
met
only
by
a
burden
of
production.
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
age
context,
the
presumption
actually
is
quite
weak.
and
it
would
be
more
than
perverse
to
adopt
the
government's
proposal,
which
is
that
notwithstanding
the
much
weaker
inference,
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
now
on
the
employer,
not
the
employee.
and,
in
fact,
the
principal
problem,
i
would
say,
with
the
government
the
eeoc
proposal--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may
i
just
finish
my
sentence--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
stevens,
and
go
right
to
"otherwise
prohibited"?
the
government's
proposal
under
which,
once
the
employer
establishes
the
statistical
disparity,
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
to
the
employer,
equates
what
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
is
a
prima
facie
case
or
a
presumption
into
liability.
it
would
dictate
precisely
the
opposite
result
that
this
court
found
in
st.
mary's
honor
center.
it
would
allow
the
jury,
upon
silence
by
the
defendant,
not
to
say,
well,
you
may
consider
this
presumption
to
be
enough
if
you
don't
hear
any
other
evidence.
it
would
tell
the
jury
the
proof
of
statistical
disparity
is
proof
of
discrimination.
and
that's
just
wrong.
now,
"otherwise
prohibited"--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
exactly
right.
now,
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
(f)
and
is...
as
justice
ginsburg
said...
is
sandwiched
in
between
two
other
provisions
that,
for
argument's
sake,
let's
just
acknowledge
are
affirmative
defenses
on
which
the
employer
would
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
and
why
doesn't
that
prove
anything?
i'll
go
first
to
"otherwise
prohibited"
and
then
explain
why
the
sandwich
effect
is
no
more
persuasive
here
than
it
was
to
the
court
in
betts.
"otherwise
prohibited"
means
that
it
is
prohibited
subject
to
the
following
conditions.
it
doesn't
say
who
bears
the
burden
of
those
conditions.
what
it
reflects,
justice
stevens,
is
this
fact.
you
could
have
taken
everything
that
is
in
f
and
just
put
it
into
a,
but
you
would
then
have
had
to
put
it
into
b
and
c
and
e.
and
so
what
congress
said
was...
it
didn't
say
not...
things
that
are
prohibited
in
section
a
won't
be
unlawful
if
x,
y
and
z.
it
says
"otherwise
prohibited"
in
those
sections.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't...
it
means
nothing
other
than
it's
prohibited
subject
to
the
following
conditions.
now,
i
will
acknowledge
for
argument's
purposes...
and
it
actually
suits
my
argument...
to
show
that
the
bfoq
defense
and
the
foreign-employer
defense
are
affirmative
defenses.
because
as
we...
as
we
know
from
black's
law
dictionary
and
this
court's
decisions,
dixon,
for
example,
an
affirmative
defense
is
a
defense
that
says:
i
admit
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
but
i
have
a
justification
for
it
that
the
law
recognizes.
now,
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
it
is
quite
to
the
contrary,
unless...
and
it
may
be
the
case
that
i'm
completely
misunderstanding
you.
the
point
is
that
at
step
one
the
plaintiff
has
to
prove
a
statistical
disparity,
a
substantial,
negative,
statistical
correlation.
and
that
raises
a
presumption
that
what
was
otherwise
a
neutral...
appears
to
be
a
neutral
factor
was,
in
fact,
because
of
age.
that
these--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--whether
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no.
what
this...
what
this
court
said
in
griggs
is
there
are
proof
problems.
there
are
plenty
of
instances
in
which
there
is
undiscovered,
unreconciled,
unacknowledged
inferences
about
people.
and
old
people
is
the
perfect
example
where
there
is
no
history
of
invidious
discrimination.
there
is
no
prior
hurdle
that,
unlike
black
people
and
women
had
to
overcome...
which
was
another
factor
in
griggs.
it's
that
we
all
get
old,
and
people
have
preconceptions
sometimes
about
the
enormity
of
limitations
of
age
which
may
not
be
justified.
so
the
way
that
these
defenses,
the
sandwich,
if
you
will,
works
is
the
plaintiff
under
wards
cove
shows
his
statistical
case.
it's
a
prima
facie...
it
shows
that
there
is
a
disparate
impact,
period.
but
the
statute--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
well
let...
let
me
see
if
i
can't
address
justice
souter's
point
first.
i
do
think
i
understand
your
point,
which
is
what's
wrong
with
the
petitioner's
case.
but,
justice
souter,
the
point
is
that
once
a
prima
facie
case
is
established
in
an
age
case...
let's
just
take
the
three
provisions
that
are
at
issue
in
(f)(1).
under
bfoq,
the
employer
gets
up
and
says:
well,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
the
judge
is
going
to
tell
you
that
they
have
established
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
way
that
these
otherwise
neutral...
that
this
was
because
of
the
plaintiff's
age.
and
you
know
what?
i
admit
it.
i,
in
fact,
admit
that
it
was
by
accident
because
of
age.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
what
he
basically
says
is:
i
agree
that
age
was
the
factor,
but
i
have
an
excuse
for
it.
and,
similarly,
in
the
third
exception,
the
foreign-employers
exception,
he
comes
in
and
says:
you
have
heard
all
of
the
statistics.
and
you
know
what?
i
did
do
this
to
disadvantage
old
people,
because
my
plant
is
in
a
country
that
discriminates...
that
makes
it
illegal
for
people
over
65
to
work.
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
and
that's
why
i
admit...
i
admit
that
i
did
this
in
a
way
that
had
a
disparate
impact
on
old
people.
i
did
it,
if
you
will,
in
order
to...
i
have
a
justification
for
it.
whereas,
in
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age,
the
assertion
is
everybody
understands
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
ultimate
burden
to
prove
that
he
or
she
suffered
an
adverse
employment
action
because
of
age,
not
because
of
some
factor
that
for
entirely
good
reasons
correlates
with
age.
and
the
showing
that
there
is
a
statistical--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no;
not
at
all.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
let's
take
their...
let's
take
their
50-pound
hypothetical.
the
employer
says:
okay,
from
now
on
all
of
our
employees
have
to
be
able
to
lift
50
pounds
over
their
head,
you
know,
10
times
in
30
seconds.
and
older
people
or
women...
let's
say
older
people,
you
know,
say:
well,
statistically,
that
has
wiped
us
out.
that
has
had
a
substantial...
a
substantial
adverse
effect
on
us
because
we
are
old,
and
we
have
less
upper
body
strength.
the
employer
then
gives...
comes
forward
with
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason
or
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age,
and
says,
for
example,
well,
you
know,
this
is...
we
need
our
employees
to
be
able
to
lift
strong
things.
if
the
plaintiff
comes
back
and
says,
i
am
an
accountant,
that's
not
reasonable,
it's
a
very
different
case
than
if
this
is
a
requirement
imposed
on
stocking
clerks
in
an
auto
parts...
auto
parts
shop
where
you
do
have
to
lift
very
heavy
things
over
your
head.
in
other
words,
the
paradigm
that
this
court
set
out
in
wards
cove
applies
exactly
the
same
way.
it
applies
a
three-part
test
except
that
at
step
three
the
standard
of
justification
is
different.
and
this,
i
think...
i
hope,
justice
stephens,
goes
to
your
question.
in
wards
cove
this
court
said
you
show
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
disparate
impact.
the
burden
then...
the
burden
of
production
then
shifts
to
the
employer
to
explain
that
it
was...
there
is
a
business...
to
articulate
a
business
justification
for
the
facially
neutral
requirement.
and
what
the
plaintiff
then
has
to
do
is
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
that
wasn't
a
business
necessity;
that
there
is
one
other
way,
one
other
way
in
which
it
could
have
been
done;
and,
therefore--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
and,
in
fact,
i
think
it's
sort
of
embedded
in
the
very
opening
of
the
blue
brief
in
this
case,
where
the
petitioner
says:
well,
the
court
has
sometimes
used
the
word
"business
justification",
and
the
court
has
sometimes
used
the
word
"business
necessity",
and
we
don't
really
think
that
means
anything,
so
we
use
the
words
interchangeably.
but
this
case
shows
that
it
means
everything
because
at
step
three
of
wards
cove
the
petitioner...
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
proving
that
it
is...
that
there
is
one
other
way...
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
it
wasn't
a
necessity
to
do
it
that
way
in
order
to
achieve
your
objective
and
the
employee
wins.
but
because
of
the
differential
in
correlation
between
age
and
employment
factors,
in
this
case
it
is
a
business
justification;
that
is,
the
employee
has
to
come
in
and
say
it
just
wasn't
reasonable
to
use
that.
and
this
case
is
a
perfect
example.
here
we
have
a
research
lab
that
has
one
client.
it's
the
nuclear
reactor
division
of
the
united
states
submarine
unit.
and
they
come,
and
they
say...
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
here...
they
say
the
cold
war
is
over.
we
aren't
going
to
have
as
much
work
for
you.
and
since
you're
cost-plus,
you're
going
to
have
to
reduce
your
work
force;
and
because
we
are
in
a
different
kind
of
war,
we
have
new
missions.
you
are
going
to
have
to
design
and
engineer
and
implement
things
that
you
hadn't
done
it
before.
and
so
you
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
go
ahead
and
do
this.
and
what
the
company
did
was
to
go
through
all
of
its
units
and
then
subunits
and
sections,
and
say:
given
the
new
mission
that
the
navy
has
told
us
we
are
going
to
have
to
occupy,
do
you
have
people...
do
you
have
more
people
than
you're
going
to
get
paid
for
to
do
what
you
have
to
do?
if
the
answer
is
yes...
if
the
answer
is
no,
you're
fine.
if
the
answer
is
yes,
please
consider
the
following:
what
are
the
skills
within
the
people
within
your
section,
subsection,
or
unit
that
are
excess,
that
in
light
of
the
reduced
and
changed
mission
we
don't
need?
identify
those
skills.
then
go
through
each
one
of
your
employees;
and
if
it
is
an
employee
with
that
skill,
rank
them
on
a
scale
of
1
to
10
according
to
four
different
characteristics:
seniority,
which
gives
a
benefit
to
older
workers;
recent
job-performance
ratings;
the
criticality
of
the
other
skills
they
have,
do
they
have
some
other
skill
that
is
going
to
be
required;
and
their
flexibility...
how
willing
have
they
been,
or
are
they,
to
learn
new
skills?
and
the
company
has
a
training
manual.
it
goes
through
and
trains
the
managers
to
do
this.
it
is
approved
by
the
department
of
energy
and
the
department
of
the
navy.
but
after
the
managers
engage
in
this
analysis
and
prepare
this
matrix,
they
then
have
to
justify
it
before
a
central
review
board,
which
the
plaintiff's
own
expert
acknowledged
was
set
up
in
order
to
make
the
managers
defend
each
decision
and
make
sure
that
those
judgments
corresponded
with
overall
management's
responsibilities.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
and
as
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
found,
those
were
strikingly
stark
numbers.
they
were
so
stark
that
they
came
to
the
immediate
attention
of
the
company's
management
and
general
counsel,
mr.
correa,
who
was...
who
looked
at
this
and
said:
we
are
going
to
get
sued
for
age
discrimination.
what
should
we
do
about
this?
and
what
he
did
about
this,
what
the
proof
showed,
is
he
went
back
and
said:
is
each
one
of
these
decisions
justifiable?
did
they
really
apply
these
factors?
he
testified
that
he
considered
just
saying:
we'll
go
back
and
redo
it
so
that
the
age
distribution
comes
out
right.
but
he
was
concerned
that
the
new
york
human
rights
law,
which
defines...
this
is
sort
of
astounding...
defines
18,
does
have
a
reverse-discrimination
provision.
but
the
point
here
is...
and,
therefore,
he
decided:
we
did
this
right;
we
used
a
matrix
that
unrebutted
testimony
said
was
the
paradigm
in
industry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
definitely
do.
and
the
second
question
that
was
presented
in
this
case,
which
the
court
didn't
accept,
was
an
assertion
by
the
petitioner
that
the
second
circuit
had
assertedly
held
that
where
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
derives
from
a
subjective
judgment,
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
it
was
immune
from
review
under
disparate-impact
theory,
which,
as
the
government
pointed
out
in
its
invitation
brief,
is
not
at
all
what
the
second
circuit
held.
the
point
is
that
this
court
in
smith
and
earlier
in
hazen
paper
and
earlier
age
cases
was
highly
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
unless
there
is
a
test
that
implies
that...
that
applies
certainty
for
employers,
there
is
going
to
be...
age...
if
this
standard
isn't
reasonable
and
if
it
isn't
up
to
the
other
side
to
prove
that
it's
unreasonable,
employers
are
essentially
going
to
take
age
into
account.
they
are
going
to
do
what
mr.
correa
testified
he
wouldn't
do,
which
is
rejigger
the
results
to
come
up
with
a...
a
percentage
that
more
approximated
the
balance
in
the
work
force.
and
that,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
why...
and
it
was
testimony
both
from
the
employees
in
the
case
and
from
our
uncross-examined
expert
and
even
their
expert...
the
review
board...
the
company
set
up
a
central
review
board
which
was
trained
and
which
examined
every
single
manager
about
every
single
decision,
whether
you
call
it
subjective
or
objective.
now,
the
district
court...
the
trial
court
who
heard
the
testimony
said
that
he...
he
deemed
flexibility
and
criticality
objective.
he
said
they
were
objective
factors
because
of
all
the
instructions
that
were
given,
which
we
have
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case.
but
even
assuming...
and
i
certainly
take
your
point,
justice
ginsburg,
that
if
you
ask
a
manager
to
evaluate
an
employee
on
the
degree
of
criticality
of
that
employee's
skills
or
the
flexibility
of
that
employee,
you
can
give
her
all
the
training
in
the
world.
you
can
give
her
a
16-point
checklist.
ultimately,
you're
relying
on
a
judgment
by
a
human
being
of
another
human
being.
but
why
would
we
not
want
employers
to
do
that?
why
would
we
want
them
to...
to
retreat
to
the
safe
harbor
of
some
safe
quota.
you
know,
gee,
we
have
a
60/40
split
in
our
work
force;
and,
wow,
these
numbers,
we
did
it
according
to
hoyle.
we've
done...
this
is
the
paradigm
rif
process,
but
go
back
and
do
it
in
a
way
that
comes
out
with
a
specific
set
of
numbers.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
it
goes
to
both.
i
mean
it
goes
to...
it
simply...
it
certainly
goes
to
the
question
over
whether,
whoever
has
the
burden
on
reasonableness,
you
ought
to
do
what
you
did
in
smith
and
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did
in
montalvo,
which
is
the
case
you
cited
in
smith.
and
in--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we
have
a
jury
verdict.
we
have
a
jury
verdict
under
wards
cove.
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
pointed
out
in...
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
first
time
and
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
here
the
last
time
and
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
second
time
and
to
this
court
on
pages
4,
5,
and
7
of
our
brief
in
opposition
this
time...
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
wrong
in
both
step
one
and
step
three
of
wards
cove.
this
is
even
assuming
wards
cove
were
the
test.
there
is...
under
step
three
of
wards
cove,
which
is
how
this
case
was
tried,
it
was
concededly
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
prove
that
there
was
some
other
way,
one
other
way,
to
do
what
the
company
wanted
that
established
that
this
wasn't
a
business
necessity.
and
i
will
represent
to
the
court
that
in
five
and
a
half
weeks
of
testimony
there
is
not
one
sentence
of
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
what
judge
jacobs
said
is
the
case
was
tried
under
business
necessity,
under
which
the
plaintiffs
at
least
had
to
prove
that
there
was
some
other
way
that
the
company
could
equally
have
achieved
its
objectives.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
because
the
eeoc
regulation
at
the
time,
regulation
(d),
which
deals
with
disparate-impact
cases,
said
that
reasonable...
the
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
provision
is
proven
by,
and
only
by,
the
business-necessity
defense,
a
defense
as
to
which
the
plaintiffs
bear
the
burden.
and,
in
fact,
in
wards
cove,
the
government
in
wards
cove
was
on
the
employer's
side.
the
government
urged
the
court
to
do
exactly
what
it
did.
and
under
the
government's
own
regulation
1625.7(d),
the
burden
of
proving
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
was
correctly
on
the
plaintiff,
but
incorrectly
equated
with
the
substantive
showing
of
business.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
no,
we
took
the
position
that
reasonable
factors
other
than
age
was
a
separate
test
and
was
a
separate
defense.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
to
the
contrary
and
said
under
wards
cove--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
what
happened
was...
i
mean,
judge
pooler
is
wrong
in
certain
respects,
but
not
that
respect.
we...
our
answer
pleaded
reasonable
factors
other
than
age,
but
we
didn't...
neither
we
nor
our
opponents
asked
for
a
separate
instruction
on
reasonable
factors
other
than
age.
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
wards
cove
analysis
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
i
mean
that...
and
that's
because...
you
could
say
that
it
was
a
mutual
mistake
by
everyone
involved.
but
the
eeoc
had
directed
under
subsection
(d)
of
its
regulations
that
reasonable
factor
other
than
age
could
be
established
only
by
proving
business
necessity.
and
both
parties--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
correct.
and
the...
my
point
is
we
are...
we
are
entitled
to
judgment
in
our
favor.
we
are
entitled
to
an
affirmance
because,
number
one,
the
second
circuit
was
correct
that
the
burden
of
proving
reasonableness
was
on
them,
and
the...
the
petitioners
have
acknowledged
expressly
on
page
53
of
their
blue
brief
that
if
in
fact
it
is
true
that
the
second...
if
the
second
circuit
is
in
fact
correct,
then
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
that
is,
they
say
when
a...
"while
a
defendant
has
no
obligation
to
press
an
issue
upon
which
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
proof...
and
therefore
the
second
circuit
may
have
been
justified
in
reviewing
the
evidence
of
reasonableness
in
light
of
its
holding
that
petitioners
bore
the
burden
of
proof--
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
pleaded
it
as
a...
i
can't
bring
the
complaint
to
mind,
but
we
pleaded
it
as
a
separately
specified
defense,
yes.
we
said,
in
our
answer
to
the
complaint,
we
said
this
is
a
reasonable
factor
other
than
age.
and
so
we
are...
everyone
acknowledges
that
if
the
second
circuit
is
correct
as
to
where
the
burden
applies,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
our
submission
is
that
the
judgment
has
to
be
affirmed
whether
or
not
the
burden
applies
as
the
second
circuit
held.
thank
you.
