justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
your
interpretation
of
the
word
"otherwise".
do
you
think
it
is
the
equivalent
of
the
statute
that
omitted
that
word,
but
added
in
"conduct
that
presents
an
equally
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
"
do
you
think...
in
other
words,
do
you
think
that
the
four
examples
define
the
risk
of
physical
injury
that,
the
risk
of
potential
physical
injury
the
statute
contemplates?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
significance
of
justice
breyer's
point
that
each
of
the
listed
crimes
is
more
dangerous
when
a
criminal
is
carrying
a
gun,
but
driving
drunk
isn't
made
any
more
dangerous
whether
or
not
there's
a
gun
in
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
comment
on
one
other
point
that
judge
mcconnell
made
in
his
opinion?
is
there
significance
in
the
title
of
this
statute,
"armed
career
criminal
act".
does
this
statute
intend
to
identify
career
criminals?
