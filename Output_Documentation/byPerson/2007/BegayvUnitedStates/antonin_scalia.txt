i
think
you
can
say
that
all
of
the
crimes
that
are
listed
require
mens
rea
and
dui
doesn't;
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
big
different,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
run
away
from
me
on
"otherwise".
i
think
the
"otherwise"
ties
the
last
paragraph
to
the...
to
the
preceding
four
enumerated
crimes.
and
if...
if
it
had
just
gone
on
to
say
"or
presents
a
serious
risk
of
injury.
"
without
the
"otherwise",
then
i
don't
think
you'd
have
any
argument
that
you
have
to
somehow
look
to
the
degree
of
injury,
the...
the
manner
of
injury
that
the
four
enumerated
crimes
have.
the
"otherwise"
ties
it
together,
"or
otherwise
presents
a
risk
of
serious
injury.
"
and
i
think
the
implication
is
that
the...
that
the...
the
injury
must
be
similar
to
the...
at
least
in
degree
to
the
enumerated
crimes
beforehand.
i
wouldn't
run
away
from
the
"otherwise".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
this
line
of
argue.
you
would
exclude,
let's
say,
physical
assault
from...
from
this,
i
mean
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
because
it's
not
a
property
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wouldn't
be
included
in
the
"otherwise
involved"?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
kruger,
what
i
don't
understand
about
this
statute
as
you're
interpreting
it
is
why
you
need
any
of
it
except
the
last
phrase?
once
you
give
the
last
phrase,
"involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
"
all
of
the
rest
of
it
is
automatically
included.
"has
as
an
element
the
use,
attempted
use
or
threatened
use
of
physical
force
against
the
person
of
another.
"
--that
obviously
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
or
is
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
the
use
of
explosives?
congress
could
have
saved
itself
a
lot
of
trouble
by
simply
erasing
all
the
rest
of
the
statute
and
simply
saying
any
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
or
not.
that
can't
be
what
they
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
would
congress
go
through
that
trouble,
unless
they
wanted
to
suggest
what
other
kind
of
crimes
they
need
to
include
by
this
residual
category
of
"any
conduct"
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
degree
of
risk...
the
degree
of
risk,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
it
doesn't
come
up
to
the
degree
of
risk
that
any
of
those
four
would,
it
would
not
be
included?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
what
did
it
do?
what's
it
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
how?
how
does
it
limit
the
latter
part?
is
it
because
they
are
all
crimes
that
require
mens
rea,
intent?
so
should
we
limit
it
by
saying
it
has
to
be
a...
a
conduct
that's
intentional
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
it
does
limit
it.
so
tell
me
how
it
limits
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nice.
benchmark
of
what?
of
intent,
of
degree
of
risk?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
the
degree
of
risk
has
to
be
pretty
much
similar
to
those
four?
justice
antonin
scalia
comparable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
but
it
didn't
mean
that...
you
said
it
didn't
mean
that
because
they
could
have
said
that
and
nothing
else.
if
that's
what
they
meant,
they
could
have
eliminated
everything
else
that
they
said.
they
obviously
meant
to
tie
that
to
the
preceding
portions.
and
when
you
tie
it
to
the
preceding
portions,
you
come
up
with
some
limitations
of
the
sort
that
justice
breyer
was
suggesting.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
says
not
at
all.
your
friend
on
the
other
side
says
that
it's
something
like,
what,
two
and
a
half
percent
for
burglary
and
point
something
for
the
chances
of
hurting
somebody
if
you're
driving
dui?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
this
is
just
limited
to
intentional
arson?
you
think
negligent
arson?
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
negligent
extortion,
negligent
use
of
explosives?
i
mean,
it's
in
a
list
of
things
that
are
talking
about,
you
know,
intentional
crimes
that
armed
career
criminals
would
be
likely
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
congress
had
the
slightest
idea.
