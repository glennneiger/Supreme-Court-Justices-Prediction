some
of
those
characteristics
don't
seem
to
apply
to
all
of
the
specific
crimes
that
are
mentioned.
take
somebody
who
sends
a
series
of
letter
bombs
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
other
people.
now,
that
would
fall
within
a
crime
involving
use
of
explosives.
but
it's
not
really
a
property
crime
and
it's
not
a
crime
that's
more
dangerous
when
done
with
a
gun.
so
how...
how
can
you
say
that
those
characteristics
apply
to
every
crime
in
the
list?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
crime
is
vehicular
homicide,
defined
as
causing
the
death
of
another
person
while
driving
intoxicated?
would
that
be
a
crime
that
creates
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,

the
residual
clause
is
a
difficult
problem,
but
i
still
have
not
heard
what
characteristic
the
enumerated
offenses
have
in
common,
all
of
them,
that
provides
a
basis
for
limiting
the
residual
clause.
they're
not
all
property
crimes.
a
lot
of
crimes
involving
explosives:
illegal
possession
of
explosives,
illegally
manufacturing
explosives,
obtaining
explosives
by
making
false
statements.
none
of
those
are
property
crimes
and
none
of
them
involve
injury
to
a
person...
i
mean
involve
the
threat
of
the
use
of
force
against
a
person.
so
what
is
the
characteristic
that
all
of
the
enumerated
crimes
have
in
common
that
would
provide
a
limitation
on
the
residual
clause?
justice
samuel

no,
they're
not.
in

u.s.c.

explosives,
unlawful...
"it
shall
be
unlawful
to
engage
in
the
business
of
importing,
manufacturing,
or
dealing
in
explosive
materials
without
a
license
issued
under
this
chapter.

there's
no
intent
to
cause
harm
there.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
the...
if
the
legislature
made
it
a
crime
to
send
text
messages
on
a
cell
phone
while
driving,
and
the
punishment
were
severe
enough
to
qualify
here?
would
that
be
treated
the
same
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
wouldn't
drunk
driving
be
property
crime?
doesn't
it
cause
an
enormous
amount
of
property
damage?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
generality
of
drunk-driving
offenses,
those
that
result
in
physical
injury
almost
always
involve,
or
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
involve,
property
damage,
too;
don't
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
an
element
of
some
of
these
other
crimes,
either.
is
it
an
element
in
burglary?
is
there
a
property
element
in
burglary?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
an
entering.
an
unlawful
entering--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that's
a
property
element?
