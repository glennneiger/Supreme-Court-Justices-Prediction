well,
in
one
way...
in
one
way
it
is,
in
that
like
those
other
crimes
it
presents
a
serious
risk
of
potential
injury
to
another.
that's
what
they
all
have
in
common.
it's
a
residual...
one
argument
that
was
made
was
when
the
statute
was
first
drafted
all
it
had
was
the
residual,
"presents
a
serious
risk
of
potential
injury
to
another.
"
so
that's,
the
argument
is,
that's
what
drives
this
statute,
and
then
these,
these
specific
crimes,
were
added
just
to
be
sure
they
would
be
covered.

how
about
a
habitual
speeder?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
of
the
anomalies
about
this,
and
we
start
out...
this
is
an
armed
career
criminal.
and
you
can
say,
well,
burglary...
burglary
and
arson,
if
you're
apprehended,
you're
the
career
criminal;
you
commit
these
kinds
of
crimes.
congress
doesn't
want
you
to
have
a
gun,
or
if
you
do,
you're
going
to
get
the
book
thrown
at
you.
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
of
a
connection.
i
mean
how...
how
is
it
going
to
make
the
dangerous...
the
drunk
driver
more
or
less
dangerous
if
he
happens
to
have
a
gun
in
the
glove
compartment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
else...
what
else
would
be
in
this
catalogue?
you
rejected
my
speeder,
but
i
think
you
said
something
about
a
reckless
driver
might,
habitually
reckless
driver.
what
else
would
fit
the
description
"conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'd
like
to
know
specifically.
you
said
reckless
driving;
and
what
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
has
the
potential
of
doing
that,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
wouldn't
that
come
in
in
the
first,
the
violent
crime,
the
first
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
about
something
in
your
brief
on
page
37?
you
said:
"congress
settled
on
this
language
because
it
had
two
other
proposals,
one
that
it
considered
too
narrow
and
one
that
it
considered
as
potentially
too
broad.
"
and
the
one
that
it
considered
potentially
too
broad
is
"any
felony
that
by
its
nature
involves
a
substantial
risk
that
physical
force
against
a
person
or
property
of
another
may
be
used
in
the
course
of
committing
an
offense
is
the.
"
--this
is
on
page
37
of
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
said
that
you...
you
look
at
the
generality
of
cases.
in
most
extortion
cases
what
they
want
is
money.
