m.
kennedy
would
you
have
the
same
answer
if
you
had
a
state
statute
which
defined
felony
drunk
driving,
as
many
do,
as
felony
drunk
driving
which
causes
serious
death
or
serious
physical
injury
to
another?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
still
say
that
that
statute
does
not
qualify?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
there
isn't
in
the
usual
felony
drunk
driving
statute,
there
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
the
driver
intentionally
drives
the
car
knowing
that
there's
a
risk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
that
is
because
everybody
knows
there
are...
there
are
two
conditions:
one
in
which
he
just
is
reckless
and
he
doesn't
care,
in
which
case
he
has
the
intent;
the
other
one,
he's
so
drunk
he
can't
form
the
intent.
both
of
them
are
covered,
and
the
latter
is
simply
because
we
don't
want
an
excuse
to
exonerate
the
more
culpable
of
the
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
true
in
almost
every
state,
for
the
reasons
that
i've
indicated,
because
many
people
have
the
intent,
and
those
that
don't
shouldn't
be
exonerated
because
they're
more
drunk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
gives
us
greater
reason
to
treat
the
last
clause
as
independent
just
so
that
we
can
be
sure
that
it
doesn't
include
only
property
crimes,
because,
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
"physical
injury"
is
really
the
term
that
does
the
work
in
the
second
clause.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
almost
giving
us
a
reason
to
make
that
clause
more
independent,
more
forceful,
more
significant.

anthony
m.
kennedy
filling
out
a
false
income
tax
return.
i
mean,
i
thought
of
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
is
a
whole
category
of
those.
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
me
what
test,
what
conclusion,
you
want
me
to
come
to
in
your
argument?
drunk
driving
is
within
the
last
clause
because--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
suppose
you
say
most
legislatures
think
this
is
dangerous.
that's
enough?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
trying
to
be
captious,
but
i...
it's
difficult
to
find
out
what
the
standard
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
explosives
involves
at
least
the
stereotype
of
the
armed
career
criminal
that
you
see
in
movies
and
hear
about
in
organized
crimes
testimony
and
so
forth.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
completely
far
of
the
mark.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
obviously...
obviously
incomplete.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would,
in
the
case
of
drunk
driving...
though,
it
seems
this
would
be
a
better
case
for
the
petitioner
if
we
were
operating
under
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
narrower
in
that
sense
as
applied
to
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
the
government
were
not
to
prevail
in
the
first
case,
rodriguez,
should
we
remand
in
this
case,
because...
because
then
he...
the
fourth
felony
would
have
been
improperly
found
if
we
rule
against
the
government
in
rodriguez?
