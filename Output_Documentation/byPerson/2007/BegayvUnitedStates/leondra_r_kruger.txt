ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
drunk
driving
is
an
act
that
by
its
nature
endangers
people's
lives.
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
it
is
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
all
50
states.
when
a
person
is
repeatedly
convicted
of
that
offense
and
therefore
becomes
subject
to
punishment
as
a
felon,
he
has
committed
a
violent
felony
as
congress
defined
that
term
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
that
is
because
he
has
committed
a
crime
that
in
the
words
of
the
statute
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
speeding
isn't
a
felony
offense
under
the
laws
of
any
state,
to
my
knowledge.
and
we
have
to
recall
that
the
acca
contains
two
requirements
for
treatment
for
prior
conviction
as
a
violent
felony
that
would
support
enhanced
sentencing
under
that
act.
the
felony
requirement
is
not
a
trivial
requirement.
it
was
in
fact
a
focus
of
congressional
debate,
and
it
was
intended
to
capture
only
serious
crimes.
as
a
general
matter,
crimes
of
ordinary
negligence,
simple
carelessness,
or
totally
blameworthy
acts
don't
merit
felony
punishment.
as
this
court
recognized
in
staples,
to
label
a
criminal
act
as
a
felony
is
indeed
a
serious
thing
and
something
that
legislatures,
by
long
tradition,
reserved
for
truly
serious
acts.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
it
would
present
a
harder
question,
justice
alito,
and
that's
because,
for
one
thing,
we
don't
have
the
uniform
judgment
of
legislatures
that
helps
us
know
in
this
case
that
drunk
driving
does
in
all
cases
present
a
serious
risk
of
injury.
and
also
because
the
conduct
that's
defined
by
the
dui
statute
of
new
mexico,
as
well
as
other
states,
by
definition
defines
conduct
that
is
unsafe.
you
only
violate
the
statute
if
you
are
impaired
to
such
a
degree
that
your
faculties
and
motor
skills
are
such
that
you
are
unable
to
drive
a
car
safely.
with
text
messaging
there
isn't
quite
that
categorical
mapping
on
of
the
risk
to
the
conduct
that's
proscribed.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
state
in
which
speeding
itself
is
a
felony
offense.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
to
my
knowledge,
at
least,
justice
breyer--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--reckless
driving,
on
the
other
hand,
when
it
does
result
in
serious
physical
injury
to
another,
is
often
punished
as
a
felony.
but
there
is
obviously
a
difference
between
speeding
by
itself
and
reckless
driving.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
what
this
court
said
about
the
structure
of
the
statute
in
taylor
is
that
congress's
purpose
was
first
to
identify
crimes
that
do
have
as
an
element
the
use
force,
but
also
to
capture
a
category
of
crimes
that
do
not
have
as
an
element
the
use
force
but
nevertheless
present
a
potential
harm
to
another
human
being.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
indeed
as
the
court
said
in
taylor
and
i
think
as
the
court
reiterated
in
james,
it
included
the
examples
of
four
enumerated
offenses
in
clause
2
to
provide
examples
of
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
they
believed
to
present
a
serious--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--yes.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
don't
know
that
the--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that
the
enumerated
crimes
set
an
absolute
four.
congress
could
have
written
a
statute
that
said
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--they
do
provide
examples
of
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
congress
thought
did
present
a
serious
risk.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think,
as
the
court
said
in
james,
all
of
these
crimes
are
quite
different
offenses
that
don't
share
very
many
characteristics
in
common,
including
incidentally
intent
to
cause
harm.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
what
it
does
is
it
provides
a
useful
benchmark
against
which
to
assess
the
risks
that
are
associated
with
any
other
crime.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
of
degree...
it's
degree
and
kinds
of
risk.
yes.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
has
to
be
comparable,
which
is
what
the
court
said
in
james--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--and
in
this
case
we
do
think
that
the
risks
associated
with
dui
are
comparable
to
the
risks--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
can
turn
on
statistical
comparisons
of
the
likelihood
that
harm
will
result
in
any
given
episode
of
any
of
these
crimes.
i
think
that
that
is
a
proposition
that
the
court
underscored
in
james,
when
it
decided
whether
attempted
burglary
qualified
without
reference
to
hard
statistics.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
hard
statistics
in
most
of
these
crimes
are
simply
unavailable.
so
to
make
the
answer
in
any
case
turn
on
the
availability
of
statistics
would
lead
to
fundamentally
arbitrary
results.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
we
think
that
it's
clear
from
the
enumeration
of
the
offenses
in
clause
2
in
the
definition
of
"violent
felony"
that
congress
wasn't
intending
to
capture
only
a
set
of
crimes
that
are
made
more
dangerous
when
they're
committed
with
a
firearm.
it
is,
in
fact,
the
kind
of
statute
that
congress
wrote
in
18
u.s.c.
942(c),
which
concerns
the
use
or
carrying
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence.
but
here
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
capturing
a
set
of
offenders
who,
by
their
criminal
history,
have
demonstrated
an
inherent
disregard
for
the
value
of
human
life
and
therefore
should
not
only
be
prohibited
from
possessing
firearms
but
should
face
particularly
severe
sanctions
for
failure
to
abide
by
that
prohibition.
our--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
initial
response
to
that
question
is
that
the
statute
that
congress
wrote
unequivocally
focuses
the
inquiry
on
the
risk
of
harm
to
other
human
beings.
congress
could
very
well
have
written
a
statute
that
required
intent
to
harm.
it
could
have
written
a
statute
that
required
intentional
use
of
force,
as
it
did
in--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
you
don't,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
most
obvious
way
to
tie
it
to
the
preceding
sections
is,
again,
to
import
a
kind
of
use-of-force
requirement
such
as
the
18
u.s.c.
16(b)
requirements
that
would
look
at
the
risk
of
force
intentionally
will
be
used
in
the
course
of
committing
the
offense,
and--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
indeed,
i
think
that
it
does,
and
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
bear
out
that
congress's
concern
about
possession
of
firearms
by
people
who
have
committed
crimes
of
a
character
that
present
a
serious
risk
in
a
serial
manner
was
indeed
well-founded.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
it
is
because,
first
of
all,
the
risks
of
drunk
driving
are
commonly
understood.
they're
supported
by
the
uniform
legislative
judgment
of
the
50
states.
and
also
because
those
risks
are
comparable
in
both
kind
and
degree
to
the
kinds
of
risks
that
are
associated
with
crimes
that
congress
specifically
enumerated
in
the
statute
as
meeting
the
test.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think,
again,
the
statistical
inquiry,
while
it
can
be
helpful
and
relevant
in
individual
cases,
is
not
dispositive.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statistics,
the
chances
of
injury
resulting
from
a
given
arson
fire
are
also
well
below
1
percent.
what
congress
wasn't
concerned
about
was
the
statistical
likelihood
of
any
injury
in
a
particular
episode--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
that
congress
was
entitled
to
look
at--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
justice
stevens,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
arson,
for
example,
or
explosives
use
is
made
more
dangerous
when
the
criminal
is
carrying
a
gun.
presumably
in
those
cases
the
criminal's
use...
weapon
of
choice
is
fire
or
explosives
rather
than
a
gun.
the
only
risk
that
would
inhere
would
be
the
risk
that
any
criminal
would
pose
when
apprehended
by
the
authorities,
and
it's
the
same
risk
that
a
presumably
a
drunk
driver
would
pose
to
others
when
apprehended
by
an
officer
who
pulls
them
over.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
one
way
to
start
to
answer
that
question
is
by
looking
specifically
at
what
congress
likely
meant
when
it
referred
to
"arson"
in
the
statute.
under
18
u.s.c.
844(i),
arson
is
defined
as
maliciously
damaging
property
by
means
of
fire
or
explosives.
but
the
way
courts
have
interpreted
that
language
is
not
to
require
intent
to
damage
property
in
all
instances.
it
also
covers
situations
in
which
the
fire
is
set
with
willful
disregard
for
the
likelihood
that
damage
will
occur;
in
other
words,
in
situations
in
which
the
fire
has
occurred
and
recklessly
poses
harm.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
kind
of
injury
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case;
that
is,
fundamentally
the
same
kind
of
risk
that
dui
poses.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
it's
certainly
true
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
i
think
that
congress
was
more
than
likely
aware
of
the
fact
that
18
u.s.c.
844
did
treat
arson
in
this
manner,
particularly
considering
that--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
the
definition
of...
the
reach
of
the
federal
arson
statute
came
to
encompass
use
of
fire
in
1982,
only
shortly
before
the
acca
was
enacted.
and
certainly
it's
true
that
most
state
legislatures
have
also
defined
arson
offenses
to
include
similar
kinds
of
intentional
setting
of
fire
with
reckless
disregard
to
the
likelihood
of
damage
or
injury
that
would
result.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
see
how
it
would
support
a
limitation
to
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
are
normally
committed
as
a
means
of
livelihood
in
that
sense
of
"career".
it
certainly
does
refer
to
career
criminals
in
the
sense
that
they
are
habitual
offenders,
that
they
are
recidivists.
but
certainly
not
all
the
enumerated
offenses,
nor
even
the
offenses
that
are
encompassed
by
the
definition
that's
contained
in
clause
1
of
the
statute,
are
normally
committed
as
a
means
of
violent--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
kind
of--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--well,
it's
certainly
true
that
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
are
encompassed
by
clause
1
of
the
definition,
sort
of
traditional
crimes
of
violence
like
murder,
assault,
rape,
are
not
ordinarily
committed
as
a
means
of
livelihood.
people
rarely
make
a
profession
of
those
types
of
careers.
and
it's
also
true
that
ordinarily
arson
is
not
committed
for
insurance
fraud,
but
is
committed
for
a
large
number
of
other
purposes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
profit
motive,
including
covering
up
evidence
of
other
crimes,
including
simple
vandalism.
so
i
think
it's
implausible
to
think
that
congress
was
really
focused
here
on
the
kinds
of
crimes
that
are
normally
committed
for
profit.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
we
think
the
category
of
crimes
of
recklessness
that
pose
an
injury,
reckless
disregard
of
the
risk
of
injury
to
others,
would
qualify
because
in
those
cases
juries
have
necessarily
found
that
there
was
objectively
a
serious
risk
and
that
failures
to
appreciate
that
risk
and
to
act
accordingly
constitutes
a
gross
deviation
from
the
ordinary
standard
of
care
that
a
reasonable
person
would
exercise.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
reckless
driving
that
results
in
serious
bodily
injury
or
death
to
another,
which
is
a
felony
under
the
laws
of
many
states,
would
qualify.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
but
reckless
driving
simple
is
ordinarily,
not
punishable
as
a
felony
under
the
traffic
laws.
we
think,
similarly,
reckless
homicide
would
qualify.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
presumably
it
wouldn't,
because
by
definition
a
reckless
homicide
does
not
involve
the
intentional
use
of
force,
the
threatened
use
of
force,
or
attempted
use
of
force.
and
the
definition
relates
solely
to
the
killing
of
another,
whether
or
not
by
intentional
use
of
force,
in
situations
that
disregard
the
great
dangerousness
to
human
life
and
those
actions.
the
other
things
that
would
qualify
would
be
cases
like
dui,
where
recklessness
need
not
be
proved
as
such,
but
that
are
underscored
by
legislative
determinations
that
the
conduct
that
is
proscribed
is
by
definition
reckless,
by
definition
poses
a
serious
risk
that
a
person
should
appreciate
and
should
accordingly
conform
their
conduct
to
a
different
standard.
petitioner's
argument
suffers
from
the
fundamental
flaw
that
it
describes
a
statute
that
congress
didn't
write.
congress
did
indeed
consider
incorporating
the
definition
of
18
u.s.c.
16
when
it
redrafted
the
statute
in
1986
and
it
decided
against
it,
instead
making
the
inquiry
turn
on
the
potential
for
risk
to
human
life
as
opposed
to
the
potential
that...
the
risk
that
force
would
be
used
or
on
the
intentional
use
of
force.
we
think
that
that
decision
is
one
that
needs
to
be
given
effect
in
interpreting
the
statute.
as
this
court
recognized
in
leocal,
the
risk
of
intentional
use
of
force
is
simply
not
the
same
thing
that
a
risk
of...
the
risk
that
an
accident
will
occur
that
will
cause
serious
injury
to
another.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
definition
of
18
u.s.c.
16.
and
it
is,
indeed,
unquestionably
broader
than
the
definition
of
924(e)(2)(d)(ii)
in
at
least
two
respects.
one
is
that
it
would
cover
misdemeanors
involving
use
of
force
as
well
as
felonies.
and
the
second
is
that
it
would
cover
crimes
that
involve
a
risk
that
force
would
be
used
against
property,
rather
than
focusing
exclusively
on
the
risk
of
harm
to
a
human
being,
as
the
definition
of
acca
does.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
indeed,
i
think
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
court's
decision--
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
--that's
correct.
ms.
leondra
r.
kruger
well,
if
the
court
decided
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case,
even
though
the
issue
was
not
pressed
or
passed
on
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
wasn't
raised
in
the
cert
petition,
we
do
think
the
court's
analysis
of
the
issue
in
that
case
applies
equally
to
its
analysis
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
felony
prong
of
the
definition
of
"violent
felony"
is
applicable
in
this
case.
so
were
the
court
to
decide
that
the
applicable
maximum
term
of
imprisonment
that
applies
to
a
recidivist
is
the
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
apply
to
a
hypothetical
first-time
offender,
then
that
decision
would
control
in
this
case
as
well.
and
the
court
should
dispose
of
this
case
accordingly.
but
it
bears
noting
that
that
would
not
dispose
of
this
question
entirely,
because
there
are,
of
course,
other
reasons
why
states
treat
drunk
driving
offenses
as
felony
offenses,
particularly
in
situations
in
which
they
result
in
serious
bodily
harm
or
death
to
another,
as
your
honor
previously
noted.
the
issue
in
this
case
comes
down
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
congress
wrote,
not
a
hypothetical
statute
that
congress
could
have
written.
and
that
statute
identifies
one
criterion
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
felony
offense
qualifies
as
a
violent
felony
under
the
acca,
and
that
is
its
potential
for
harming
other
human
beings.
drunk
driving
is
commonly
understood
to
present
a
serious
potential
risks
of
injury.
the
potential
risks
of
injury
are
the
only
reason
why
it's
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
50
states.
and
the
risks
associated
with
drunk
driving
are
comparable
in
both
kind
and
degree
to
the
risks
associated
with
arson
and
explosives
use,
two
crimes
that
congress
specifically
identified
in
the
statute
as
satisfying
its
definition.
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
determined
that
mr.
begay
was
sentenced
properly
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act
and
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
its
determination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
