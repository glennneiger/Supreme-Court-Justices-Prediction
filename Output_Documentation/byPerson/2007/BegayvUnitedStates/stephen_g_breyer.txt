justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're
quoting
that,
then
this
is
what's
now
bothering
me.
i'm
not
saying
i
have
an
answer
one
way
or
the
other.
let's
take
two
crimes
and
imagine
that
the
same
number
of
people
injured
or
killed
is
identical
for
the
two.
one
let's
say
is
burglary
and
the
other
is
driving
under
the
influence.
now,
let's
imagine
exactly
the
same
number
are
put
at
risk,
exactly
the
same
number
hurt,
exactly
the
same
number
killed.
when
i
wrote
that
opinion,
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
still
is
an
important
difference
between
the
two
crimes
that
is
controlling
here.
but
if
you
look
at
what
i
wrote,
i
didn't
articulate
that
difference
very
well.
so
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
what
i
should
have
said
in
order
to
have
said
very
clearly
just
what
that
intuitive
difference
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
is
no
state
where
speeding...
even
if
maybe
you
hurt
somebody
or
something...
there
is
no
state
where
speeding
is
under
a
statute
that
you
could
be
imprisoned
for
more
than
a
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
a
felony
as
defined
here.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
you're
focusing...
it's
defined
here
as
"subject
to
by
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year.
"
now
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
we're
on
the
same
wavelength.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
could
have
turned
it
just
on
dangerousness.
i'm
back
to
justice
scalia
and
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
i'm
simply
sort
of
repeating
those
in
a
sense
that
make
it
quite
specific.
imagine
a
universe
of
crimes.
every
member
of
that
universe
we
concede
has
precisely
the
same
degree
of
danger
as
arson,
explosives,
burglary.
so
there's
no
argument
about
the
risk
to
human
life.
it
is
identical.
and
now
we
write
a
statute,
and
the
statute's
object
is
to
take
people
who
are
felons
in
possession
of
a
gun
and
those
persons
whom
it
is
particularly
bad
that
they
have
a
gun
are
going
to
go
away
for
15
years
minimum.
so
what
we're
looking
are
people
who
are
particularly
bad
that
they
have
a
gun.
now
go
back
to
our
universe,
and
in
that
universe
we
have
some
things
on
the
one
hand
like
arson,
but
on
the
other
hand...
i
have
to
name
a
few,
environmental
crimes
committed
by
negligence
or
recklessness,
where
somebody
flushed
a
toxic
substance
down
the
drain
or...
here's
a
good
one
i
found...
if
you
are
a
steamboat
captain
or
an
executive
of
a
steamboat
company
and
you
fail
through
negligence
or
simple
inadvertence
to
stop
somebody
from
not
inspecting
a
lifeboat,
well,
felony
or
worse.
and
there
are
quite
a
few
dozens
of
these
things:
failing
to
stop
at
an
inspection
station
if
you
are
a
trucker.
you
know?
there
are
quite
a
few,
where
what's
at
issue
is
negligence,
thoughtlessness,
and
maybe
even
recklessness,
but
it
seems
to
have
nothing...
and
it's
dangerous...
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether,
when
later
on
you
want
a
gun,
you
are
a
greater
risk
for
having
a
gun,
you're
more
likely
to
pull
the
trigger,
you're
more
likely
to
aim
it
at
somebody
and
shoot
him.
now,
that's
i
think
what
we
are
trying
to
drive
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
a
person
who
deliberately
burns
down
buildings,
is
a
person
who
if
he
had
a
gun
might
pull
the
trigger?
and
i
will
suggest
that's
a
reasonable
inference.
i
also
will
give
you
this:
that
a
person
who's
so
careless
as
to
go
drunk
driving
is
a
person
whose
gun
might
go
off
carelessly
or
he
might
leave
it
around
the
house.
so
i'll
give
you
that
one.
but
my
instinct
is
that
congress,
in
this
act,
is
not
worried
about
guns
going
off
carelessly
around
the
house.
they
are
worried
about
a
person
being
the
kind
of
person
who
will
point
a
gun
at
somebody
and
pull
the
trigger.
now,
is
there
something
you
can
say
that
disabuses
me
of
that
instinct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
an
act
called
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
involves
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
unlawfully
possessing
a
firearm,
a
gun
with
--
because
he
has
previously
been
a
felon.
but
the
act
says,
convicted
of
that,
if
a
person
is
convicted
of
that
and
has
three
earlier
convictions
for
a
certain
drug
crimes
or
violent
felonies,
then
there's
a
special
mandatory
minimum
prison
term
of
15
years.
and
the
question
here
is
we
look
at
the
definition
of
those
prior
convictions
and
we
say
he's
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol,
one
of
those
crimes
that
triggers
the
special
15-year
sentence.
now
the
ones
that
trigger
the
15-year
sentence,
they
a
have
to
have
a
prison
term
themselves
of
more
than
a
year.
well,
driving
under
the
influence
has
that
kind
of
prison
term
attached
to
it.
it
also
has
to
have
either
as
an
element,
the
use
of
force
against
somebody,
while
driving
under
the
influence
doesn't
have
that.
or,
it
has
to
satisfy
a
certain
special
definition
in
a
kind
of
property
type
provision,
and
that's
what's
at
issue
here.
does
it
or
does
it
not
fall
within
that
special
definition?
well,
what
is
that
definition?
the
crimes
that
satisfy
those
definitions,
and
crime
satisfies
that
if
the
crime
“is
burglary,
arson,
or
extortion,
involves
the
use
of
explosives,
or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.”
well,
driving
under
the
influence
is
a
dangerous
crime,
and
it
does
risk
a
serious
harm
to
another
so
we
assume
it
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
but
still,
that
provision
lists
four
examples,
namely
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
and
explosives.
and
we
conclude
that
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
is
so
different
from
those
examples,
that
congress
did
not
intend
this
statute
to
apply
to
driving
under
the
influence.
now
how
is
it
different?
well,
the
listed
crimes
typically
involve
purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive
conduct,
but
the
drunk-driving
statutes
normally
do
not
insist
on
purposeful,
violent,
and
aggressive
conduct
and
so
they
are
comparable
to,
or
nearly
comparable
to
crimes
that
impose
strict
liability
which
criminalize
conduct
in
respect
to
which
the
offender
need
not
have
had
a
criminal
intent.
now,
when
we
look
at
the
act's
basic
purpose,
we
think
that
difference
which
sounds
a
little
technical
matters.
the
act's
title
says,
think
of
it,
the
armed
career
criminal
act
and
we
used
to
think
it
focuses
upon
a
special
danger
created
when
a
particular
type
of
offender,
a
violent
criminal,
or
a
drug
trafficker
possesses
a
gun.
for
example,
the
special
danger
that
such
a
person,
if
he
possesses
a
gun
might
deliberately
point
the
gun
and
pull
the
trigger.
a
history
of
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
and
explosives
doe
tend
to
show
that
the
offender
is
that
kind
of
person.
but
a
history
of
drunken
driving
while
it
certainly
could
indicate
the
person
is
a
person
of
very
serious,
even
unforgivable
carelessness
does
not
tend
to
show
that
he
is
that
kind
of
person,
a
person
who
poses
that
kind,
a
special
gun-related
arm
career
criminal
risk.
so
congress,
we
think
did
not
intend
to
impose
a
15-year
mandatory
prison
term
in
that
kind
of
instance.
for
these
reasons
and
for
others
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
the
crime
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
falls
outside
the
scope
of
the
armed
career
criminal
acts
violent
felony
definition.
the
15-year
special
term
does
not
apply
and
we
reverse
the
contrary
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
thomas
and
souter
have
joined.
