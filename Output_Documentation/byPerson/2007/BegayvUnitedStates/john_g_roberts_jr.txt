chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
06-11543,
begay
v.
united
states.
ms.
katze.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
assuming,
of
course,
that
the
canon
of
ejusdem
generis
applies
to
the
statute,
as
opposed
to
congress
just
singling
out
a
couple
of
things
it
wanted
to
be
sure
were
covered.
and
we
left
that
issue
open
in
james,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
then
i
was
wondering
about
that
as
well,
that
as
a
violent
felony
whether
that
gives
you
any
traction.
but
extortion,
you
don't
normally
think
of
that
as
a
violent
felony
and
yet
it's
clearly
included
in
the
definition.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
you
don't
say,
give
me
that
or
i'll
break
your
legs
all
the
time.
you
may
say,
give
me
that
or
i'll
release
this
embarrassing
letter.
that's
extortion.
it's
not
violent,
though.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then,
releasing
the
letter
is
not
violent
and
it
may
cause
embarrassment
rather
than
physical
injury.
yet
it
would
qualify
as
extortion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
odd,
when
the
catch-all
is
phrased
in
terms
of
physical
injury
to
another,
to
say
that
it's
concerned
only
with
property
crimes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
"otherwise"
in
the
statute
is
in
fact
used
to
mean
"likewise"?
i
mean,
if
we
said
"attempted
burglary"
in
james
it's
obviously
included
because
burglary
is...
attempted
burglary
doesn't
present
a
risk
in
a
different
fashion
from
burglary.
it
presents
it
in
the
same
fashion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
was
a
helpful
question.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
particularly
when
you
look
at
subsection
(i)
in
the
broad
reading
of
serious
potential
risk
of
(ii),
why
would...
why
would
congress
mean
to
exclude
a
particular
category
of
physical
injury
from
the
reach
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
everything;
everything
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
think
presents
the
most
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
all
of
us,
that
we
are
going
to
be
a
victim
of
arson
or
that
we
are
likely
to
get
hit
by
a
drunk
driver?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
kruger.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that?
i
guess
this
is
a
question
i
asked
your
friend.
i
mean,
degree
of
risk.
i
mean
what
are
the
odds
that
we're
going
to...
that
if
there's
a
burglary,
some
physical
injury
might
result
as
opposed
to
an
episode
of
drunk
driving.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
other
words,
i
guess...
do
we
really
look
at
how...
what
percentage
of
drunk
drivers
are
involved
in
accidents
as
opposed
to
what
percentage
of
burglars
are
involved
in
violent
confrontations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much
of
a
limitation
is
the
point
justice
breyer
was
making?
i
mean,
let's
say
you've
got
a
habitual
drunk
driver.
everybody
in
town
says
he
always
drives
drunk.
i
mean,
how
would
they
greet
the
news:
guess
what?
he's
just
got
a
gun.
i
mean,
that
raises
the
level
of
risk
significantly,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kruger.
ms.
katze,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
extortion
doesn't
involve
property
as
an
element.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
something
of
value...
something
of
value
could
be,
you
know,
a
confession
in
a
related
case
or
something.
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
that.
yes.
life,
liberty,
and
property
include
more
than
property,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
know
that
attempted
burglary
is
covered,
and
you
don't
have
to
enter
the
house
in
an
attempted
burglary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
well,
you
are
saying
this
is
an
analogous
crime
to
the
four
that
are
listed,
or
it
is
not
an
analogous
crime
to
the
four
that
are
listed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
katze.
the
case
is
submitted.
