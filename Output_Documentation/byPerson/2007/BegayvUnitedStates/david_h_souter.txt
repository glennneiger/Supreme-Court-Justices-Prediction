david
h.
souter
then
why
did
it
use
the
word
"otherwise"?
why
didn't
it
use
the
word
"likewise"?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
would
have
meant
something
different,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
"otherwise"
means
in
some
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes.
[laughter]
that's
usually
the
best
way
to
understand
each
other
is
by,
you
know,
assuming
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in...
in
doing
that,
you've
got,
in
other
words,
to
understand
what
"otherwise"
means.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
language
that
follows
"otherwise".
and
that's...
that
then
refers
to
"risk
of
serious
injury
to
a
person.
"
and
in
effect,
it
is
saying
the
common
element
is
risk
of
injury
to
the
person.
how
that
risk
is
raised
may
be
in
different
ways
from
the
way
the
risk
is
raised,
say,
in
a
burglary
case
or
what-not.
and
if
that
is
the
proper
analysis,
then
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
a
tough
row
to
hoe
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
says
"person",
not...
it
says
"person",
not
"reputation".
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
the
violence
can
be
against
the
reputation.
that's
not
what
the
statute
is
talking
about.
i
mean
that
is...
that's
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
doesn't
talk
about
violence
in
the
abstract.
it
talks
about
physical
force
against
the
person
of
another
in
number
1;
and
in
number
2,
where
we
are
here,
"a
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
"
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
idea
of
risk
of
violence.
a
burglar
when
he
commits
burglary
does
not
want
violence.
he
wants
to
get
the
silver
out
of
the
sideboard
and
get
back
down
the
ladder.
he
doesn't
want
any
violence
with
anybody.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
problem
is
that,
by
being
in
the
situation
he's
in,
he
creates
a
risk
that
violence
will
occur.
somebody
may
show
up.
and
the
person,
likewise,
who
commits
dwi
doesn't
want
to
hurt
anybody,
but
he
has
placed
himself
in
a
situation
in
which,
if
somebody
shows
up
driving
another
car
in
front
of
him
or
walking
across
the
street
or
maybe
even
in
apprehending
him
for
his
dwi,
a
risk
of
violence
is
raised.
the
two
cases
in
that
respect
are
parallel.
justice
david
h.
souter
when
the
drunk
leaves
the
bar,
doesn't
he
have
the
realization,
unless
he
is
just
blind
at
that
point,
that
he
may
be
apprehended?
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
not
going
to
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
nearest
cop.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
when
a
guy
goes
up
the
ladder
for
the
silver
in
the
sideboard,
at
most
what
he
wants
is
the
silver.
