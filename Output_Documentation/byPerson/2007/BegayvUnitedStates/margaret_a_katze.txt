ms.
margaret
a.
katze
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
dwi
is
a
violent
felony
for
purposes
of
an
armed
career
criminal
act
sentencing
enhancement.
sentencing
enhancement
takes
the
statutory
sentencing
range
from
zero
to
10
years
and
raises
it
to
15
years
to
life.
the
intent
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
to
punish
most
severely
that
category
of
recidivist
violent
offenders
who
are
disproportionately
responsible
for
the
violent
crimes
and
who,
when
they
possess
a
weapon,
are
more
dangerous.
the
government
is
trying
to
expand
the
reach
of
the
statute
by
so
broadly
reading
the
residual
clause
as
to
include
any
crime
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
another.
such
a
reading
of
that
residual
clause
would
swallow
the
entire
statute.
congress
had
no
intention
of
including
dwi
within
the
ambit
of
the
armed
career
criminal
act.
as
justice
breyer,
writing
for
the
first
circuit
in
doe,
said,
"there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
meant
to
enhance
sentences
pursuant
to
the
armed
career
criminal
act
based
on
convictions--
"
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--your
honor,
i
think
what
you
said
was
sufficient,
but
you
might
have
added
that
there
are
other
attributes
to
the...
the
crimes
in
the...
the
enumerated
crimes,
those
being
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
use
of
explosives.
there
are
certain
attributes
that
they
share
in
common
that
dwi
does
not
share,
and
those
would
include
those,
as
you
stated,
an
active
violent
crime.
but
in
addition
to
that,
they're
all
property
crimes,
as
this
court
said
in
taylor.
they
are
also
all
acts
that
have
the
intent
of
causing
harm.
dwi
does
not
have
that.
they
are
all
more
dangerous
when
committed
with
a
gun.
and
they're
all
typical
of
crimes
that
would
be
committed
by
career
criminals.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
your
honor,
arguably
they
might
not
apply
to
everyone
every
time.
but
i
think
the
vast
majority
of
them
do.
and
what
we're
looking
at
are
in
ordinary
cases.
and
the
example
that
you
gave
of
the
letter
bomb,
i
believe
that
would
be
a
property
crime.
when
we're
talking
about
a
property
crime
as
with
arson
or
use
of
explosives,
it's
the
destruction
of
property.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
absolutely.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
think
it's
a
huge
difference.
dui...
dui
in
new
mexico
is
a
strict
liability
crime.
it
has
no
mens
rea
whatsoever.
an
individual
doesn't
even
have
to
have
the
intent
to
drive.
and,
in
fact,
we
have
a
case
in
new
mexico
where
a
woman
had
taken
ambien
and
was
driving,
and
she
didn't
even
know
she
was
driving,
but
she
still
was
convicted
because
she
merely
was
in
control
of
the
vehicle.
so
in
new
mexico,
a
strict
liability
crime
where
you
don't
even
have
to
know
you're
driving,
as
opposed
to
the
four
enumerated
offenses,
where
there
is
clearly
some
intent
to
cause
some
harm--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
think
it
would...
the
analysis
wouldn't
be
different.
there
would
be
an
additional
element,
an
additional
piece
of
harm.
but
the--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--not
unless
there
is
a
definition
of...
if
there
is
an
actual
intent
to
cause
harm.
if
there
is
just
merely
harm
that's
caused--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--and
i
agree.
i
think
in
that
case,
then
that
also
would
not
fall
within
the
statute.
there
is
not
the
intent
to
cause
harm.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
that
would
not
fall
under
paragraph
2,
because
it
would
not
meet
any
of
the
other
attributes
of
the
enumerated
crimes.
possibly
could
it
fall
under
paragraph
1,
the
use
of
force?
it
would
depend
how
the
elements
described
what
the
definition
of
use
of
force.
this
court
has
previously
defined
use
of
force
as
an
intentionality
that
i
think
normally
in
that
type
of
vehicular
homicide
would
not
be
included.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
yes,
you
did.
in
james
you
were
dealing
with
a
clearly
analogous
case,
and
dwi
is
not
analogous
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
with
those
four
enumerated
crimes.
and
i
think
that
it's
pretty
clear--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--your
honor,
answering
your
question
and
the
chief
justice's
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
first
version
of
this
statute
came
out
in
1984,
and
that
just
involved
burglary
and
robbery.
and
then
in
1986,
we
have
the
version
that
we
have
now.
what
we
are
discussing
is
the
debate
in
congress
that
occurred
between
then
and
how
the
actual
wording
was
made
up.
but
i
submit
that
if
congress
wanted
to
use
those
four
enumerated
crimes
merely
as
an
example,
they
would
have
structured
the
paragraph
differently.
they
would
have
made
a
third
paragraph
under
definition
of
violent
felony
and
they
didn't.
there
are
two
paragraphs.
the
second
paragraph,
the
one
that
we're
dealing
with,
clearly
there's
a
substantive
connection
between
the
four
enumerated
crimes
and
it
says,
"or
otherwise
crimes
that
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury.
"
it
seems
clear
to
me
if
we
look
at
this
under
the
rules
of
statutory
interpretation...
and
this
is
a
statutory
interpretation
case...
that
congress
added
those
four
crimes
as
a
means
of
limiting
the
residual
clause.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
would
agree,
"likewise"
would
have
been
a
more
artful
way
to
have
written
it.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
think,
in
fact--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--that's
the
dictionary
definition,
your
honor.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
would
agree
that's
one
thing
that
we
look
at.
but
under...
this
is
a
statutory
interpretation
case,
not
a
dictionary
case,
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
plain
meaning.
and
that
involves
looking
at
this
turn
of
the
phrase
in
context,
in
the
whole
text.
what
was...
what
was
the
intent
of
this
statute?
what's
the
term
to
be
defined,
"violent
felony".
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
running
away
from
the
"otherwise".
while
i
don't
agree
that
it's
the
dictionary
meaning,
i
do
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
it
is
the
substantive
link.
it's
the
connection.
it's
a
word
and
we
have
to
give
meaning
to
every
word
in
the
statute--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
believe
the
correct
analysis...
and
i
do
believe
that
ejusdem
generis
does
apply
here,
because
here
we
have
a
list
of
four
specific
offenses
followed
by
a
general
term,
and
we
have
to
read
that
general
term
narrowly
so
as
not
to
give
additional
breadth
to
acts
of
congress.
and
we
have
to
remember
that
we're
defining
the
term
"violent
felony".
and
those
four
violent
felonies
that
have
the
certain
attributes
in
common
then
are
followed
by
"or
otherwise".
and
in
looking
at
it
all
in
context,
there
has
to
be
some--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--it's
violent
in
the
sense
that
extortion
is
trying
to
get
something
from
somebody
of
value.
it's
the
idea
that--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
think
it
is
violent
in
the
sense
of
the
terms
that
this
court
used
in
leocal
and
that
justice
breyer
used
in
doe,
the
idea
of
some
kind
of
violent
act
or
more
closely
related
action.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
it
absolutely
would,
and
this
court
in
taylor
said
that
the
four
crimes
all
have
those...
basically,
in
general,
have
those
attributes.
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
ordinary
case.
i
believe
even
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
have
given,
your
honor,
is
that...
that
that
does
involve
an
act
of
violence
against
an
individual's
reputation,
that
reputation
in
the
common
law
sense--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
but
the
statute
does
talk
about
violence.
if
we
look
at
the--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--yes,
your
honor.
and
in
the
second
paragraph
it
deals
with
property
crimes.
and
the
whole...
it
all
comes
under
the
rubric
of
violent
crimes.
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about.
even
the
serious
drug
offenses,
the
reason
those
were
added
to
the
statute
is
the
concern
about
violence
with
drugs.
so
it
all
has
to
do
with
the
idea
of
violence,
and
so,
initially,
it
was--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
and
here's
why
i
don't
think
they're
parallel.
in
a
burglary,
i
agree
with
you,
the
individual
doesn't
want
to
get
caught,
but
goes
with
the
fear
or
the
knowledge
that
they
may
be
apprehended.
they
may
arm
themselves...
again,
the
concern
with
those
violent
activities
and
being
armed.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
it
is
just--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--absolutely
not,
but
here's
the
big...
the
big
difference.
if
somebody
is
drunk
and
gets
in
a
car,
at
most
their
intention
is
to
get
from
point
a
to
point
b.
they
have
no
intention
of
hurting
an
individual.
they
don't
even
have
the
intent
of
driving.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
but
he
intentionally
goes
to
somebody
else's
property
to
commit
this
act
that
will
cause
harm.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
in
dwi
there
is
no
intention
to
drive.
it's
a
strict
liability
offense,
as
the
example
i
gave
in--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--your
honor,
in
new
mexico,
dwi
is
a
strict
liability.
there
is
no
intent.
there
is
not
even
negligence.
it's
merely
being
in
control
of
a
vehicle.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
if
i
may
just
add
as
well,
in
some
of
the
discussions
about
the
actions
of
dwi
and
running
into
people,
it's
important
to
note,
if
we're
looking
at
this
with
a
categorical
analysis,
just
to
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense.
dwi
in
new
mexico
would
necessarily...
there
would
have
to
be
another
element.
if
somebody--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--at
their
very
least,
they
all
are
acts
that
intend
to
cause
harm.
they
all
are
property
crimes.
this
court
reiterated--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--your
honor--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--your
honor,
the
term
in
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
the
"use
of
explosives".
this
court
has
defined
"use"
as
having
an
intentionality,
and
intent...
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
intent
to
use
those
explosives...
and,
from
a
practical
point
of
view,
people
who...
and
we
could
talk
about
the
ordinary
case.
people
who
use
explosives,
they
blow
up
property.
they
blow
up
houses.
they
blow
up
bridges.
at
the
very
least,
they're
blowing
up
explosives.
that
certainly...
that
certainly
is
an
act
to
cause
some
type
of
harm
to
property.
and,
with
respect
to
whether
they
are
property,
i
submit
all
four
are
property
crimes.
this
court
said
in
taylor
all
four
of
them
are
property
crimes.
this
court
interpreted
the
congressional...
the
legislative
history.
those
were
four
property
crimes
that
congress
specifically
wanted
to
add
to
the
concern
about
violence--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--yes.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
no,
your
honor,
that
would
not
fit
under
paragraph
2.
that
would
fit
under
paragraph
1,
the
use
of
force
against
an
individual.
congress
carefully
crafted
this
statute.
they
dealt
with
serious
drug
offenses
and
they
dealt
with
offenses
against
people,
and
then
they
dealt
with
offenses
against
property
where
there
was--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--property
crimes
with
the
potential
for
physical
injury
to
another,
not
just
purely
property
crimes.
the
four
enumerated
crimes
all
have
the
potential
for
physical
injury
to
another.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
make
that
interpretation,
which
is
basically
what
the
government
is
suggesting,
which
would
read
"otherwise"
out
of
the
statute
and
therefore
either
make
it
tantamount
to
a
third
paragraph,
which
there
is
not
a
third
paragraph,
or
would
basically
make
the
residual
clause
so
broad
it
would
swallow
the
entire
statute.
and
we
can't
believe
that
congress
would
have
so
carefully
delineated
the
different
areas
of
violent
felonies
and
then
eviscerate
it
all
with
this
residual
clause.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
agree
"equally
serious"
would
be
the
exact
correct
equivalent.
i
think
that
that
would
be
in
keeping
with
justice
scalia's,
more
or
less,
my
impression
of
justice
scalia's
dissent
in
james,
because
i
would
submit
that
there
has
to
be
even
more
than
just
an
equal
balance
of
risk.
i
do
think
that
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
compared,
as
this
court
did
in
james.
the
court
compared
the
risk
of
attempted
burglary
to
burglary
and
found
that
they
were
similar.
i
think
in
a
non-analogous
case
there
are
other
attributes
that
we'd
have
to
look
at,
and
that's
why
we
suggest--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--and
that
was
this
court's
analysis
in
james,
and
i
think
that
that's
reasonable
to--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
think
it's
important
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
term
that
we
are
defining,
"violent
felony",
and
that...
as
well
as
the
purpose
or
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
punish
a
very
small
percentage,
as
this...
as
this
court
said
in
taylor,
a
very
small
percentage
of
very
serious
offenders.
this
isn't
a
statute
that
is
written
to
say
any
individual
who
has
three
felony
convictions
that
may
cause
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
an
individual
is
going
to
get
15
years.
that
simply
wasn't
the
purpose.
the...
the
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
punish
this
small
population
of
individuals.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
because
if
it...
if
it
did
include
absolutely
everything,
then
it
would
swallow
the
whole
statute,
because
certainly--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
think
it...
if
it...
for
example,
if
it
could
include
dwi,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
what
kind
of
crime
wouldn't
be
included
in
there.
under
that
type
of
reading,
if
we
look
at
the
structure--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--other
than
maybe
some
white-collar
crime.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
but
the...
the
problem
with
that
analysis
is
that
congress
was
very
clear
who
these...
who
this
statute
was
geared
at;
and
as
judge
mcconnell
said
in
his
dissent,
the
name
of
the
statute,
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
is
not
just
window
dressing.
there's
a...
i
mean,
that
just
reinforces
our
interpretation
that
there
is
this
very
small
percentage
of
individuals.
it's
not
supposed
to
be
a
general
catch
phrase.
and--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--here's
why
it's
hard
to
answer
that:
i
wouldn't
argue
with
you
that
there
are
more
people
driving
drunk
than
there
are
people
burglarizing
houses,
but
the
relevant
analysis
is
what's
the
risk
in
an
individual
incident?
and
in
that
case
statistically
there
is
a
greater
risk
of
injury
in
a
burglary,
under
this
court's...
in
tennessee
v
garner,
it
said
8.3
percent,
as
opposed
to
a
quarter
of
a
percent
in
an
individual
episode
of
drunk
driving.
so
we
can't
put
the
cumulative
drunk
driving
on
the
back
of
mr.
begay.
we
look
at
the
individual
incident,
doing
categorical
analysis,
looking
at
the
elements
in
that
individual
incident.
congress
was
very
concerned
about
issues
of
federalism.
the
reason
for
the
armed
career
criminal
act
was
to
support
law
enforcement
efforts
on
the
part
of
states,
not
to
federalize
crime,
not
to
federalize
criminal
investigation
and
prosecution.
we
are
suggesting
that
keeping
that
in
mind
and
looking
at
the...
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase
that
we
were
discussing,
and
looking
at
the
way
the
statute
is
actually
structured
and
the
fact
that
there
are
not
three
different
paragraphs,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
congress
could
have
picked
to
just
say
"or"
as
opposed
to
"or
otherwise",
and
we
have
to
give
"otherwise"
a
meaning;
and
we
suggest
that
our
meaning
of
"likewise"
is
one
that
this
court
has
adopted
previously.
previously
this
court
has
said
"or
otherwise
qualified
for
a
position.
"
and
found
that
people
were
qualified
in
a
similar
way
than
other
people;
"otherwise
qualified
to
vote",
found
that
individuals
were
as
qualified
or
similarly
qualified
as
individuals
of
another
race.
one
other
example,
bringing
a...
by
certiorari
"or
otherwise"
was
found
to
be
found
to
mean
to
be
by
similar
means
as
certiorari.
and,
your
honor,
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
thank
you.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
the
problem
with
the
government's
interpretation
is
that
it
offers
no
limiting
principle
whatsoever.
it's
merely
open
to
say
absolutely
any
offense
that
would
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
another
would
fall
within
the
statute.
and
that
clearly
does
not
take
congress's
intent
to
heart.
and
there
has
to
be
some
other
limiting
principle,
something
more
than
just
the
words
in
the
residual
clause,
especially
when
we
are
giving
every
word
in
the
statute
meaning.
we
suggest
that
our
test
of
analyzing
those
four
enumerated
crimes
which
were
intentionally
put
there
by
congress,
to
look
at
the
attributes
of
those
four
crimes.
that
they
are
active,
violent
property
crimes
more
typical
of
crimes
committed
by
career
offenders,
more
dangerous
when
committed
with
a
gun--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--under
a
categorical
analysis,
there
is
no
element
that
has
anything
to
do
with
property
whatsoever
in
dwi,
which
brings
me
to
my
next
point
that
recidivism
is
not
an
element
of
dwi
in
new
mexico.
the
elements
to
commit
dwi
in
the
first
offense
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
fourth
offense.
there
is
no
difference.
and
there
is...
certainly,
congress,
intended
that
there
would
be
a
distinction
between
violent,
intentional
felonies
and
accidental
or,
at
worst,
negligent
crimes.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
i
believe
it
does.
it's
trying
to
get
something
of
value
from
another
person.
that
thing
of
value
is
property.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
in
the
ordinary
case,
it's
property
even
if
we
think
of
it
as
reputation;
property
in
the
sense
of
the
common
law,
life,
liberty,
and
property;
that
that
includes
more
than
just
physical
property,
i
think.
in
addition,
this
court
has
said
that
those
four
offenses
are--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--"property"
includes
more
than
tangible,
physical
property.
reputation
is
considered
property
under
that
definition.
merely
stating
that--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--that
is
correct,
and
money
is
property.
and
that
is
exactly
what...
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
court
said
in
taylor
that
those
four
offenses
are
property
offenses.
and,
again,
in
james
this
court
again
referred
to
those
four
offenses
as--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--but
that's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
we
can--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
a
breaking
and
entering
into
a
building,
in
some
type
or
respect
a
property.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
right.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
yes,
sir.
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
you
have
to
enter
a
property.
it's
this
something...
property--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--i
think
that's
exactly
the
situation
when
there
are
analogous
crimes.
it's
clear
to
see
that--
ms.
margaret
a.
katze
--that's
correct,
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
four
offenses
that
were
enumerated
by
congress
are,
in
fact,
property
crimes.
this
court
has
said
that
in
taylor
and
again
referred
to
those
four
crimes
as
property
crimes
in
james.
but
even
if
this
court
doesn't
believe
they
are
property
crimes,
the
bottom
line
is
dwi
is
so
far
afield
of
the
four
enumerated
crimes,
the
attributes
that
they
had,
at
the
very
least
the
intent
to
do
crime,
that
it's
clearly
outside
the
scope
of
what
congress
could
ever
have
intended.
thank
you.
