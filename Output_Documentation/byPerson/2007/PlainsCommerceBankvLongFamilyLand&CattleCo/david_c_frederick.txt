mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
both
standing
and
the
merits,
but
because
there
are
some
additional
wrinkles
on
the
standing
question
in
light
of
how
it
was
briefed
in
the
reply
brief,
i'd
like
to
make
three
brief
points
on
the
merits
before
addressing
standing.
first,
the
bank
engaged
in
a
seven-year
business
relationship
with
the
longs,
knowing
that
they
were
indians
and
deriving
substantial
commercial
benefits
from
the
longs'
tribal
status
through
the
bia
loan
guarantees.
second,
the
bank
has
not
challenged
tribal
court
jurisdiction
over
the
breach
of
contract
claim
or
the
bad
faith
claim,
which
are
the
core
claims
in
the
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
i'll
address
that,
justice
ginsburg,
on
the
general
verdict
point,
which
is
there
is
actually
some
law
of
this
which
i
would
like
to
describe
for
the
court
my
understanding
of.
my
third
point,
though,
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
below
found
significant
that
the
bank
had
conceded
tribal
court
jurisdiction
in
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
its
counterclaim,
and
they
found
that
concession
to
be
important
to
note,
and
both
courts
below
found
the
indian
character
of
the
long
family
company
to
be
notable
as
well.
under
this
court's
two
court
rule,
those
fact
findings
are
entitled
to
significant
respect.
now,
as
to
the
standing
question
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
get
to
your
point
on
the
general
verdict.
this
is
ultimately
a
question
of
tribal
procedural
law,
how
the
tribal
court
would
treat
vacature
of
a
claim
deemed
to
be
an
invalid
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
mr.
chief
justice,
under
tribal
law
number
1,
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
tribe
has
adopted
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
procedure
in
the
tribal
courts,
and
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
49,
there
are
provisions
for
special
verdicts
and
general
verdicts,
and
rule
49(a)(3)
provides
that
if
no
specific
objection
is
made
to
a
fact
or
finding
requested
by
the
jury,
it
is
waived.
the
bank
here
did
not
make
a
specific
objection
to
the
general
interrogatory
number
6,
therefore,
they
may
be
deemed
to
have
waived
their
objection
to
having
the
damages
collected.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
the
trial
transcript
which
is
contained
at
roughly
pages
555
through
562
of
the
tribal
court
record,
there
was
colloquy
on
how
these
special
interrogatories
were
to
be
framed.
the
bank
objected
to
number
4,
the
discrimination
count
on
the
ground
that
a
company
cannot
be
discriminated
against,
only
individuals
can
be
discriminated
against.
that
objection
was
sustained,
and
so
special
interrogatory
4
was
written
as
you
see
it
in
the
joint
appendix.
the
bank
did
not
object
to
the
general
verdict
question
on
damages,
so
the
law
on
rule
49(a)(3)
would
be
that
special
verdict
is
deemed
to
be
waived,
and
now
there
is
some--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--precisely
so,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
way
cases
say
general
verdicts
should
be
deemed,
if
there
is
an
invalid
claim,
there
are
competing
views
about
what
to
do
with
that
when
the
damages
awarded
is
treated
as
a
general
verdict.
there
is
a
circuit
split
on
the
question
of
what
you
do
when
there
has
not
been
a
specific
objection
preserved
and
there
is
a
general
verdict
and
one
invalid
claim
and
evidence
that
supports
a
valid
claim.
now
recall,
they
don't
challenge
the
breach
of
contract
claim.
our
brief
points
out
how
the
evidence
supports
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
now
judge
kozinski
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
case
called
mccord
v.
maguire
873
f
2d
1271
says
that
this
waiver
rule
means
that
their
ability
to
challenge
the
general
verdict
would
be
waived
and
they
would
be
forced
to
live
with
the
verdict
if
evidence
supports
it.
under
that
rule--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
the
first
circuit
in
a
case
called
gillespie
versus
sears
roebuck,
386
f
3d
21
takes
the
position
that
if
you
have
not
filed
your
objection
you
have
not
waived
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
chief
judge...
i
was
about
to
say
that.
they
are
both
very
fine
opinions;
they--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
tribal
court,
which
would
be
looking
to
federal
law
to
resolve
the
effect
of
a
supposed
tainted
claim...
if
you
were
to
conclude
that
a
discrimination
complaint
is
a
tainted
claim...
would
have
to
evaluate
what
effect
that
has
on
the
final
judgment.
and
because
there
is
a
circuit
conflict
on
that
question,
unfortunately,
i
cannot
give
you
a
definitive
answer
as
to
how
the
tribal
court
would
resolve
that.
my
point,
though,
is
that
if
this
court
concludes
that
there
is
a
redressibility
problem
in
this
case,
which
we
would
submit,
respectfully,
there
is,
the
appropriate
course
would
be
to
vacate
and
remand
for
the
lower
courts
to
certify
the
question
to
the
tribal
court
of
appeals
or
to
make
some
further
inquiry
into
the
law
to
determine
how--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
i've
asked
you
to
go
with
the
ninth
circuit
court
because
that
is
what
i
think
is
the
correct
rule.
but,
justice
scalia,
any
time
a
different
jurisdiction
incorporates
some
law
into
its
own
system,
it
is
opining
as
a
matter
of
cheyenne
river
sioux
tribe
law.
and,
as
cohen's
indian
law
treatise
points
out,
tribal
courts
would
not
look
not
only
to
federal
sources
but
also
to
state
courts,
too.
the
rule
in
south
dakota
follows
the
general
verdict
rule
in
which--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct
although
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
precedent--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
there
are
published
decisions.
this
court...
this
is
a
question
of
first
impression.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
court
would
look
at
the
various
sources
of
law--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
like
to
beg
the
indulgence
of
the
court
in
not
answering
that
question
specifically.
[laughter]
my
point--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
to
the
contrary,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
a
state
supreme
court
case
on
point
called
pourier,
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
which
says
that
a
majority-owned
corporation
under
south
dakota
state
law
shall
be
treated
as
a
member
of
that
tribe
for
the
tax
purposes
that
were
at
issue
in
that
case.
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
step
back
and
say
i'm
not
here
to
advocate
that
there
can
be
different
racial
characteristics
of
corporations.
what
is
anomalous
about
this
case
and
the
way
the
bia
has
set
up
this
program
is
that
the
bia
establishes
principles
of
indian
identity
so
that
it
can
determine
whether
it
satisfies
congressional
mandates
for
indian
financing.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
banks
typically
do
require
lots
of
documentation,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
difference
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
bank
required
bia
loan
guarantees
as
a
condition
of
making
the
loans.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
did
not.
they
required
more,
and
that's
the
important
point.
the
facts
actually
matter.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
would
acknowledge
that
when
there
are
no
bia
loan
guarantees
required,
a
bank
may
or
may
not
know
of
the
identity
of
the
owners
of
the
corporation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
without
further
facts,
no.
here,
though,
the
bank
required
the
bia
loan.
it
went
on
to
the
reservation
to
scrutinize
the
collateral.
it
required
personal
guarantees
from
the
tribal
members.
it
got
collateral
in
guarantees
on
the
personal
effects
and
chattels.
it
knew
that
the
corporation
was
doing
all
of
its
business
on
tribal
trust
lands.
it
went
into
the
tribal
headquarters
to
determine
that
the
tribe
was
comfortable
with
the
various
loan
arrangements.
it
enlisted
the
assistance
of
tribal
financial
officers
to
ensure
that
the
cash
flow
would
be
a
sufficient--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think,
in
general,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
that
hypothetical.
but
here,
if
you
took
away
the
bia
loan
piece,
i
think
the
facts
very
strongly
point
to
the
bank
knowing
it
was
engaging
in
a
consensual
relationship
with
indians
because
it
went
on
tribal
trust
lands.
it
involves
the
officers
of
the
tribe
for
effectuating
the
loan.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
alito
i
don't
think
i
can
improve
on
the
language
that's
in
montana
in
its
first
exception,
itself,
which
is
that
there
are
consensual
relations
that
are
licensing
of
commercial--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
i
think
that
the
strate
case
imposed
a
nexus
requirement.
i
think
the
liability
has
to
arise
out
of
that
consensual
relationship,
which
it
clearly
does
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i
don't
think
necessarily
any
loan.
i
think
i
answered
mr.
chief
justice's
question
to
the
effect
that
any
kind
of
general
loan
of
that
nature
would
not
necessarily
give
rise
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i
think,
justice
alito,
that
there
are
very
fine
gradations
in
the
facts.
and
we
are
not
asking
for
an
articulation
of
a
general
rule
of
the
kind
of
sweeping
effect
that
the
petitioners
are
asking
for.
we
are
asking
for
a
straightforward
application
of
montana
1
on
facts
here
that
developed
over
a
substantial
number
of
years.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
would
give
rise
to
the
kind
of
consensual
relationship
that
montana
was
speaking
about.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
what's
missing
is
the
longevity
of
a
relationship,
the
degree
to
which
the
cause
of
action
arose
out
of
the
answering
of
that
ad.
i
mean
one
of
the
features
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
that
the
necessary
concomitant
of
having
tribes
with
their
elements
of
sovereignty
residing
within
states
and
within
the
united
states
is
to
have
somewhat
less
bright-line
features
to
some
of
these
jurisdictional
principles.
our
submission
here
is
that
the
facts--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--given
the
facts
that
are
present
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
would
although
the
court
in
national
farmers
and
in
iowa
mutual
could
have
disposed
of
the
case
simply
on
a
bright-line-rule
basis
but
rejected
that
very
notion.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
and...
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
how
i
understood
your--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
that's
how
i
understood
justice
kennedy's
question.
you
know,
and
it
is
the
same--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that,
yes,
it
can
be.
i
mean
the...
i
thought
i
heard
the
petitioner
acknowledge
today
that
if
the
discrimination
rule
had
been
written
down,
that
that
would
be
perfectly
fine
to
put
everybody
on
notice.
these
principles
of
discrimination
here
are--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
my...
my
mission
here
is
that
the
bank
did
not
avail
itself
of
any
of
the
procedures
in
rule
12
to
clarify
the
source
of
the
law,
to
move
to
dismiss
the
discrimination
claim,
to
move
for
summary
judgment
on
the
discrimination
claim.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
this
bank
has
availed
itself
purposefully
of
tribal
courts
on
at
least
14
occasions.
this
would
be
the
15th
case.
these
are
set
out
in
the
tribe's
brief,
the
amicus
brief,
footnotes
27,
28,
and
29.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
is
not
a
stranger
to
the
tribal
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
my
point
is--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
i'm
saying
that
the
availment
of
the
tribal
court
is
what
creates
the
jurisdiction.
i'm
saying
it
responds
to
the
point
that
the
bank
can
hardly
claim
surprise.
they
know
how
to
deal
with
tribal
law
and
tribal
procedures.
they
could
have
asked
the
nonmember
judge
who
presided
over
this
trial
to
clarify
how
the
discrimination
would
be
done.
in
the
tribal
transcript,
the
colloquy
on
discrimination
was
rather
straightforward
as
to
treating
members
in
a
fair
way
as
compared
to
treating
nonmembers.
these
are
not
difficult
concepts
in
the
law.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
have
two
suggested
responses
to
that,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
that,
when
a
tribal
court
judgment
needs
to
be
enforced,
it
can
be
brought
in
state
court,
and
south
dakota
follows
the
comity
rule,
which
means
that
it
has
to
satisfy
certain
requirements
of
fairness,
adherence
to
basic
principles,
and
the
law
before
a
state...
the
state
court
will
enforce
the
tribal
court
judgment.
under
national--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
it's
not
full
faith
and
credit;
it's
comity.
and
that
comity
provides
for
a
substantive
review
while
enforcing
the
judgment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
way
the
south
dakota
statute
is
worded,
mr.
chief
justice,
unfortunately,
i
can't
give
you
a
direct
answer
to
that
because
it
involves
a
panoply
of
issues
whether
state
law
deems
the
final
judgment
ultimately
to
be
a
fair
one
and...
and,
importantly,
when
this
court
recognized
the
jurisdictional
point
as
giving
rise
to
federal
jurisdiction
in
national
farmers,
i
would
submit
it
also
perhaps
created
the
avenue
for
the
enforcement
of
judgments
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
as
well.
i
don't
understand
why
a
jurisdictional
challenge
and
a
challenge
to
the
enforcement
of
a
judgment
could
not
give
rise
to
the
same
federal
question
jurisdiction
recognized
in
national
farmers.
so
i
think
there
are
two
avenues
to
be
in
state
or
federal
court
when
enforcing
a
judgment
in
tribal
court
that
heretofore
for
have
not
fully
been
explored,
certainly
not
by
any
decisions
of
this
court.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
