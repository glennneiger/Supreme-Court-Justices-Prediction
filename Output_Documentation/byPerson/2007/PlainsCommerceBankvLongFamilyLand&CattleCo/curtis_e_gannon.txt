mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
montana
framework
confirms
that
indian
tribes
can,
in
some
circumstances,
exercise
legitimate
authority
over
nonmembers
and
nonmember
land
on
their
reservations.
unlike
what
has
happened
in
the
criminal
context,
the
political
branches
have
not
acted
to
divest
tribes
generally
of
civil
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers.
both
before
and
after
montana
was
decided,
congress
and
this
court
have
repeatedly
articulated
the
firm
federal
policy
of
encouraging
tribal
self-government
and
have
recognized
that
tribal
justice
systems
are
an
essential
part
of
tribal
governments.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
justice
scalia,
that's
of
course
true,
that
there
is
a
difference,
but
the
montana
framework
recognizes
that
the
political
branches
have
not
completely
divested
tribes
of
their
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers
in
circumstances
like
this.
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
it
did
not
specifically
address
any
previous
cases
involving
jurisdiction
over
a
nonmember
defendant
who
is
hailed
into
federal
court.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
but
i
think
it
is...
it
is
the
case
that
it
clearly
recognized
a
consensual
relationship
that
is
established
before
the
lawsuit
begins
is
what
provides
for
regulatory
jurisdiction
in
some
of
the
cases
and
adjudicatory
jurisdiction,
as
is
now
clear
from
strate
and
the
court's
subsequent
decisions.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
in
iowa
mutual,
this
court
did
state
that
tribal
courts
are
best
qualified
to
interpret
and
apply
tribal
law.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--generally,
yes.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
expand
upon
the
discussion
that
you
were
having
with
mr.
frederick,
that
the
consensual
relationship
that's
necessary
to
establish
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
montana's
first
exception
requires
not
only
that
there
be
a
consensual
relationship
with
a
member,
and
which
we
do
think
that
implicit
in
that
is
some
knowledge
at
least
objective
knowledge
that
you
knew
you
were
dealing
with
a
tribal
member.
and
so
if
the
consensual
relationship
were
established
and
with
somebody
who
was
not
a
nonmember
who
subsequently
ended
up
through
sales
of
shares
to
become
a
member,
we
don't
think
that
that
ex
post
facto
development
would
effect
the
establishment
of
the
original
relationship.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
yes,
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
that
is
something--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--absolutely,
justice
scalia,
and
that
follows
directly
from
the
terms
in
montana
itself
because
montana
says
that
the
exceptions
are
are
about
instances
of,
quote,
"civil
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
on
the
reservation.
"
and
that's
an
important
factor.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
only
reason--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
everything
about
this
transaction
is
related
to
the
reservation.
to
be
sure,
part
of
it
dealt
with
the
land
on
the
reservation,
but
the
rest
of
the
ranch's
operations,
including
places
where
the
bank
possessed
collateral
and
security
interest
in
personal
property,
were
on
tribal
grazing
land.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
the
thing
that's
key
here,
i
believe,
is
that
the
subject
of
the
contract
was
intimately
connected
with
the
reservation
itself,
and
that's
why
it
comes
within
montana's
discussion
of
civil
jurisdiction.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
without
any
further
facts,
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
enough
to
establish
jurisdiction.
what's
important
here
is
that
the
subject
of
the
contract
was
actually
on
the
reservation,
and
that's
why
it
comes
in--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
loan
here
was
for
specific
purposes.
it
was
for...
i
mean,
there
were
a
lot
of
specific
terms
in
which
the
bank
dictated
lots
of
practices
on
the
ranch,
and
it
knew
everything
about
the
way
the
operation
was
being
conducted
or
required
express
approval
for
individual
purchases
and
things
like
that.
and
so,
this
is
not
an
instance
where
a
member
is
engaging
in
business
off
the
reservation.
and
indeed
in
blaze
construction
the
court
addressed
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
member-owned
corporation
that
was
doing
business
on
a
different
reservation,
and
the
parties
conceded
there
that
that
would
not
be
considered
to
be
a
member
for
purposes
of
montana...
that
was
actually
a
taxation
case,
but
it
would
not
be
considered
a
member
for
purposes
of
these
exceptions.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
that's
generally
correct,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
a
dispute
in
the
probate
proceedings
about
exactly
the
status
of
the
land.
but,
yes,
this
transaction
did
involve
transfer
of
the
deed
to
the
bank,
and
therefore,
at
that
point
it
would
have
been...
to
the
extent
that
that
transfer
was
effective,
it
would
have
been
a
nonmember
only
on
the
reservation.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
the
thing
that
triggers
the
regulation
here
or
the
jurisdictional
authority
of
the
tribe
is
the
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribal
member.
and
so
it's...
it's...
it's
not...
this
isn't...
this
isn't
like
a
tort
that
occurred
on
a
particular
piece
of
land
while
we
are
asking--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes,
justice
scalia.
and
the
montana
exception
to
deal
with
jurisdiction--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i...
i...
i
can't
say--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--in
general,
the
sale
of
goods
off
the
reservation,
unless
there
is
some
particularly
intimate
connection
with
the
reservation
that...
that
the
parties
anticipate
at
the
time,
probably
isn't
going
to
be
enough
to
trigger
jurisdiction.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--for
a
home
that's
on
the
reservation?
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
it's
for
remodeling
the
home--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yes.
i
think
that
that's...
if
it
were
going
to
be
used
for
something
completely
off
the
reservation,
then
maybe
an
argument
could
be
made
that
it
doesn't
have
enough
to
do
with
regulating
activities
that
are
occurring
on
the
reservation.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
that's
an
example
where
i
do
think
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--if
they
know
that
they
are
dealing
with
a
member
and
they
have
not
included
any
forum
selection
or
choice
of
law
provisions
that
say
that
they
want
to
be
sued
and
resolve
disputes
in
some
other
forum,
then
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
they
will
be
sued
in
tribal
court.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
it's
probably
unlikely
that
the
tribal
courts
would...
or
that
the
tribe
would
adopt
a
rule
like
that,
because
as
a
pragmatic
matter
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
their
citizens
to
engage
in
business
relationships
if
they
had
a
categorical
ban
like
that.
and
so--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i...
if...
if
there
was
a
forum
that
would
be
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
underlyng
consent.
and
i
do
think
that,
in
general,
forum
selection
clauses
here
ought
to
be
enforced.
and
so,
it
would
be
relevant
to
the
scope
of
the
consentual
relationship
there.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
the...
the
only
duties
that
the
bank
was
exposed
to
here
were
a
duty
not
to
breach
contracts
and
not
to
discriminate.
and
the
only
question
is
the
source
of
those
duties.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
it
was
the...
under...
according
to
the
jury
instruction
it
was
a
person
or
entity
denied
a
privilege
to
a
person
based
solely
upon
that
person's
race
or
tribal
identity.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
thank
you.
