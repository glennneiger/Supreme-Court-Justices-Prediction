justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
your
argument
was
that
the
general
principle
that
was
adopted
in
montana
is
the
tribal
jurisdiction
extends
only
to
those
things
that
are
necessary
to
protect
tribal
self-government
or
to
control
internal
relations,
and
that
merely
entering
into
consensual
commercial
transactions
doesn't
fall
within
that,
but
if
one
were
to
consent
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts,
then
that
would
be
an
additional
basis
for
jurisdiction.
i
thought
that
was
what
your
argument
was.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
are
many
facts
here
that
are
favorable
to
your
position,
but
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
articulate
the
rule
of
law
that
you
would
like
us
to
adopt
in
this
case,
the
general
principle
that
you
would
like...
the
general
rule
that
you
would
like
us
to
adopt.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
that
be
the
case:
any
consensual
relationship
between
a
member
of
the
tribe
and
a
nonmember
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
an
indian
goes
to
a
bank
off
the
reservation
and
asks
for
a
loan
and
gets
the
loan.
that
contract
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
so
the
indian
goes
to
the
bank
and
says:
i'm
an
indian.
give
me
a
loan.
the
bank
gives
him
a
loan.
that's
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
it
necessary
for
there
to
be
some
kind
of
clear
notice?
somebody
puts
an
ad
in
the
newspaper
to
sell
a
used
car.
someone
shows
up
to
purchase
the
used
car.
he
purchases
the
used
car
and
says:
and,
by
the
way,
i'm
an
indian.
that
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
not?
what's
missing
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
"on
the
land"
mean...
"on
the
reservation"
mean
land
on
the
reservation
or
does
it
extend
any
further
than
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let's
say
an
indian
gets
an
auto
loan
for
a
vehicle
to
be
used
in
a
business
on
the
reservation.
is
that
on
the
reservation?
