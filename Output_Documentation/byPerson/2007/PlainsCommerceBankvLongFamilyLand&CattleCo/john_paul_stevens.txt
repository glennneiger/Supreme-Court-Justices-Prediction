would
the...
would
the
jurisdiction
issue
be
any
different
if
it
were
a
contract
claim?
supposing
your
client...
they
had
brought
suit
against
your
client
claiming
a
breach
of
contract,
would
there
have
been
tribal
court
jurisdiction?
justice

well,
we
would
assume
that
the
corporation
had
a
breach
of
contract
claim,
could
they
have
sued
in
tribal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
isn't
whether
that
was
an
appropriate
plaintiff.
do
you
think
the
tribal
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
of
such
a
contract
claim?
