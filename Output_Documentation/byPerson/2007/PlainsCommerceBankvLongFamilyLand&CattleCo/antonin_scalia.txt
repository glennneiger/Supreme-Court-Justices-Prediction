justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
that
regulation
does
include
regulation
by
adjudication
for
purposes
of...
of
federal
pre-emption
laws.
why
would
it...
why
would
it
be
different
for...
for
indian
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand,
but
i'm
just
talking
about
the
first
one
now.
you
say
it
is
not...
it
is
not
regulation,
right,
under
the
first?
and
that's...
that's
the
only
point
i'm
addressing.
why
should
regulation
through
a
process
of
adjudication
not
be
considered
regulation
for
purposes
of
our
indian
law
where...
whereas,
we
have
made
clear
in
several
cases
that
it
does
constitute
regulation
for
purposes
of
federal
pre-emption
under
statutes
that
pre-empt
state
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
have
said
the
same
thing
about
the
congress.
congress
just
said...
just
said
"regulation",
and
we
interpreted
that
term
to
include
common-law
adjudication.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
really
mean
"actual
consent"
by
"actual
consent",
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
should
use
a
different
term,
like
"implicit
consent",
maybe.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
one
of
your
answers
to
an
earlier
question
suggests
the
same
point
that
you
now
seem
to
be
making,
although
i
don't...
i
don't
recall
it
from
your
brief.
apparently
you
think
that
it
would
be
different
if
this
antidiscrimination
law
of
the
tribe
had
been
set
forth
in
a
tribal
ordinance.
is
that
right?
would
you
say
your
client
could
have
been
held
to
it
if
it
had
been
written,
rather
than
simply
a...
a
portion
of
tribal
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
i
asked.
i
asked
whether
you
would
acknowledge
that
your
client
could
be
bound
if
it
had
been
written.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we
shouldn't
place
any
weight
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
common-law
regulation,
rather
than
regulation
by
a
statute
or
ordinance.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
it
either
makes
a
difference
or
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
just
told
me
it
didn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
told
me
that
even
if
it
were
written
down,
you
would
still
need
what
you
think
is
express
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
part
of
the
transaction
the
obtaining
of
back-up
liability
on
the
part
of
the
individual
indians
who,
who
owned
the
corporation?
didn't
they
guarantee
the
loan?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
does
give
the
whole
thing
a
decided
flavor
of
dealing
with,
with
indians
on
the
reservation.
you're
dealing
with
a
corporation
that,
that's
majority
owned
or
entirely
owned.
is
it
majority
or
entirely?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
you
get
guarantees
from,
on
reservation
indians.
it
smells
like
dealing
with
indians
on
the
reservation
to
me.
of
course,
this
certainty
that
you're...
that
you're
asking,
your
client
could
have
obtained
that
certainly
by
inserting
a
choice
of
law
provision
providing
that
any
disputes
would
be
resolved
somewhere
else,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
absence
of
that,
why
should
we
bend
over
backwards
to
give
something
that
has
the
smell
of
dealing
with
the
indians
any
other
name?
your
clients
can
fully
protect
themselves
by
a
choice
of
forum
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
a
contract
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
a
contract
claim?
was...
was...
was
the
claim
a
claim
for
discrimination
in
contracting
so
that
it
was
part
of
the
contract
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
freestanding
tort
action,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
they
are,
they
are
not
objecting
to
a...
to
a
general
verdict.
they
are
objecting
to
the
fact
that
in
their
view,
one
of
the
elements
of
that...
of
that
general
verdict
is
based
upon
what
they
assert
is
an
invalid
claim
in
the...
in
the
indian
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
they
waive
that
when
they
when...
when
they
allow
a
general
verdict
to
go.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
evidence
supports
any
one
of
the
claims
contained
in
the
general
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
tribal
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
be
finding
federal
law.
it
wouldn't
be
indian
law;
it
would
be
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
they
have
adopted
the
federal
rules.
so
whatever
the
federal
law...
in
other
words,
we
would
ask
them
to
answer
the
question
that
you
don't
want
us
to
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly,
your
reliance
upon
the
federal
rules
doesn't
impress
me
as
much
as
it
did
when
you
first
told
me
about
it,
because
apparently
the
federal
rules
mean
whatever
the
tribal
courts
say
they
mean;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
come
to
its
own
decision
as
to
what
they
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
we
get
special
loan
guarantees?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
to
be
a
known...
a
known
consensual
relationship,
for
one
thing.
wouldn't
you
add
that
requirement.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
backed
off
on
that.
i
pressed
the
point
and...--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be;
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
"tribal".
i
mean,
it
certainly
would
be
rational
to
say
that
all
disputes
between
members
of
the
tribe
can
be
resolved
authoritatively
by
the
tribal
court,
but
it's
quite
a
different
thing
to
say
that
a
dispute
between
a
nonmember
of
the
tribe
and
a
member
of
the
tribe
can
go
to
the
tribal
court.
it's
sort
of
the
analogue
to
being
home
fried
in
a
foreign
state.
it's...
is
pretty
close.
justice
antonin
scalia
defendant,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
add
on
the
reservation?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
he
walks
into
some
town
in
south
dakota,
the
mere
fact
that
you
know
he's
an
indian...
it
has
to
be
on
the
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
correct
that
the
collateral
here,
the
land,
the
land
that
was
collateral
was
within
the
reservation
but
it
was
not
indian
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
that's
enough.
it
doesn't
have
to...
when
you
say
"on
the
reservation",
you
include
as
on
the
reservation
land
that
is
no
longer
owned
by
indians
but...
but
is
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
wait.
you
say
that
consensual
relationship
is
not
enough.
if
you
enter
into
relationship
with
indian
in
south
dakota
on,
you
know...
in
the
state
capital,
that
isn't
enough.
it
has
to
be
on
the
reservation.
you
acknowledge
that.
and
for
purposes
of
on
the
reservation,
it's
enough
that
you're
dealing
with
land
that
is
within
the
reservation
even...
even
if
it
is
no
longer
indian
land?
