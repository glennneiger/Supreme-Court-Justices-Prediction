justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
that
the...
that
the
regulatory
authority
could
be
broader
than
the
adjudicatory
authority?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
that
kind
of
implicit
consent
applies
in
the
tax
context,
i
don't
see
why
in
theory
it
doesn't
apply
in
the
situation
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
somebody
is
going
to
do
business
with
the
tribe,
with
tribal
members,
in
a
way
that
affects
the
tribe
on
the
reservation,
it
makes
just
as
much
sense
to
say,
well,
they
implicitly
consent
not
to
discriminate
against
tribal
members
because
of
their
indian
status.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
it
was
implicit
in
the
tax
situation,
as
you
responded
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
take
another
example,
the
other
explicit
example
from
montana,
which
mentioned
taxing
and
licensing.
are
you
saying
that
if
a...
in
any
particular
activity,
say,
running
a
filling
station
or
advertising
oneself
as
a
certified
mechanic
in
the...
at
the
filling
station
on
the
reservation,
and
the
tribe
says,
well,
we
are
going
to
license
mechanics
to
make
sure
they
are
competent.
are
you
saying
that
there
has
got
to
be
an
explicit
agreement
to
the
licensing
in
order
for
the
tribe
to
enforce
its
licensing
restriction
against
somebody
who
goes
to
work
for
that
gas
station?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then,
that's...
that's
implicit
consent
then,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
doesn't
sign
a
document
saying
"i
consent";
he
just
goes
to
work.
and
your
answer
says,
okay,
that's
enough
to
catch
him
on
licensing.
in
justice
ginsburg's
example,
if
they
started
doing
business,
that's
enough
to
catch
them
on
taxation.
and
if
that
is
so,
why
isn't
tribal
dealing
sufficient
in
effect
to
supply
an
implicit
consent
not
to
discriminate?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
why
draw
the
line
where
you
want
to
draw
it?
we've
got
a
line
in
which
the...
i'll
put
a
blank,
the
"x"
consent...
what
did
we
want...
whatever
adjective
we
want
suffices
for
taxation
and
it
suffices
for
licensing.
why
doesn't
it
suffice
for
nondiscrimination?
why
do
we
draw
the
line
where
you
want
it
drawn?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
banker,
you
several
times
have
raised
a
point
which
seems
to
me
to
go
to
the
nature
of
the
first
exception
in
montana
on
an
issue
we
haven't
discussed
yet,
and
i
want
to
get
clear
on
it.
you
have
emphasized
consistently
through
your
argument
the
need
for
consent
whether
we
call
it
actual,
explicit,
some
kind
of
consent
to
at
least
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
upon
which
a
judicial
jurisdiction
is
premised.
and
my
understanding
is
that
that's
not
what...
i
don't
have
montana
in
front
of
me,
but
my
understanding
is
that
that
is
not
what
montana,
in
effect
said
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
first
exception.
as
i
recall
what
the
court
said
in
montana
it
was
that
there
may
be
situations
in
which
a
nonmember
enters
into
a
consensual
relationship
with
the
tribe
or
tribal
members,
and
as
a
result
of
that
consensual
relationship,
it
then
would
be
appropriate
to
recognize
jurisdiction,
for
example,
to
tax
regulatory
jurisdiction.
my
understanding
is
that
the
consent
that
montana
was
talking
about
was
not
a
consent
to
the
specific
jurisdiction
whether
it
be
regulatory
or
adjudicatory,
but
rather
consent
to
some
kind
of,
or
a
consent
forming
some
kind
of
a
relationship
that
would
make
it
appropriate
for
the
tribe
to
assert
regulatory
jurisdiction.
so
that
the
consent
does
not
have
to
relate
to
jurisdiction
as
such.
am
i...
if
that
is
correct,
then
your
argument
for
consent
seems
to
me
to
miss
the
point.
but
maybe
i'm
missing
the
point
of...
of
montana.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
point
of
my
question
was
do
you
agree
that
there...
within
the...
the
description
of
the
exception
in
montana,
that
there
need
not
be
a
consent,
either
to
the
regulation
or
to
an
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
regulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
montana
exception
has
been
modified
by
later
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that's
your
argument
what's
left
of
the
first
exception?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
first...
but
as
i
understand
it
the
first
exception
would
have
no
independent
application
unless
the
second
exception
were
met...
were
satisfied,
i.e.,
there
was
a
tribal
need
based
on
self-government,
economic
self-protection
and
so
on
which,
which
would
in
effect
validate
the
tribe's
attempt
to
regulate,
which
seems
in
effect
to
say
that
everything
turns
on
the
second
exception,
not
the
first.
