justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
incorporate
under
tribal
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it's
inherent
in
montana
exception
number
1,
that
an
indian
tribal
court
in
the
course
of
adjudicating
commercial
dealings
has
the
capacity
to
elaborate
common
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
tribal
common
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
that's
necessary
for
regulating
consensual
relationships?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
suppose
it
were
the
first
occasion?
i
mean,
what's
the
rule?
that
doesn't
help
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
if
you
go...
if
you
make
a
mistake
14
times,
you're
bound
to
15?
that's
kind
of
an
estoppel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
does
jurisdiction
follow
all
regulatory
authority?
if
it's
within
regulatory
authority,
then
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
necessarily
jurisdiction
to
enforce
in
a
tribal
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
civil
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
position,
is
regulatory
jurisdiction
concomitant
with
civil
judicial
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
general
principle
underscores
the
validity
of
your
point
that
it's...
is
it
a
republican
form
of
government
law,
due
process
clause?
what
is
the
general
principle
you
rely
on
to
say
we
have
to
look
to
the
structure
of
these
courts?
if
the
structure
is
insufficient,
then
it
violates
what
prohibition
in
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
due
process
for
whom?
the
tribal
courts
aren't
governed...
aren't
creatures
that
are
subject
to
the
due
process
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is...
what
is
the
constitutional
prohibition
that
is
a
restriction
on
assigning
cases
to
a
court
that
does
not
follow
the
due
process
clause
if
it's
an
indian
court?
it's
not
the
same
as
if
we
assign
this
to
the
american
arbitration
association.
what's
the
difference?
