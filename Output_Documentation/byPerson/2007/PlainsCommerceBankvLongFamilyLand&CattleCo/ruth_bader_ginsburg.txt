justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
any
example
of
that?
i
mean,
i
found
that
rather
surprising
in
your
brief.
the
montana...
a
clear
case
that
montana
talks
about
is
tax,
the
imposition
of
a
tax.
well,
if
a
jurisdiction
has
authority
to
tax,
then
surely
it
has
authority
to
sue
to
collect
that
tax.
so
i
am
not
aware
of
a
case
where
a
state
or
tribe
or
nation
has
authority
to
regulate,
to
legislate,
but
lacks
authority
to
enforce
that
regulation.
and
if
you
have
an
example
of
that,
i
would
appreciate
being
enlightened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
regulation
that
was
authorized
but
unenforceable
in
the
courts?
i
don't
recall...
montana...
hicks
having
said
anything
on
that
subject.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
would
consent
to
be
taxed?
i
mean
the
tax
is...--
[laughter]
it's
being
imposed.
but,
say,
at
the
gas
station,
they
don't
ask
you
when
you
drive
up:
now
do
you
consent
to
the
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
different
from
consent.
you
can
say
i
don't
consent
as
loudly
as
you
like
and
as
often
as
you
like,
and
you
still
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
recognize
that
the
bank
was
on
notice,
at
least
that
it
was
a
federal
requirement
that
when
you
deal
with
individual
indians
or
what
this
loan
company
was,
it
was
an
organization
of
indians...
that's
what
the
federal
law
calls
it...
there
is
a
duty
of
fair
dealing?
the
federal
law
requires
that.
isn't
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not...
it's
not
uncommon
that
a
state
would
adopt
a
federal
standard
as
its...
as
its
own
on
a
question
of
civil
rights.
a
state
might
stay,
well,
we
choose
to
construe
our
human
rights
law
in
accord
with
the
federal...
federal
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
an
organization
of
indians?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
that
the
bank...
i
thought
that
the
long
company
was
a
plaintiff
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
long
company
asserted,
along
with
the
individuals,
contract
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
long
company
did
not
make
a
tort
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
isn't
this
judgment,
even
if
you're
right
about
the
individuals
in
the
tort
claim,
why
isn't
this
judgment
good
at
least
as
to
the
contract
claim,
which
are
not
challenging
and
which
runs
to
the
benefit
of
the
long
company
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
tort
claim
that
you
are
challenging?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
consensual
relationship
is
what
you
just
said,
contracts,
leases
or
other
commercial.
so
the
consent
is
to
the
commercial
relationship.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
certainly
not
in
strate,
which
you
quoted
before
as
saying
if
you
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate,
then
have
you
jurisdiction
to
enforce
the
regulation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
said
they
don't
need
to
because
they
said
if
they
win
on
their
claim,
then
their
whole
case--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
is
no
objection--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you're
not
asking
us
to
resolve
that
circuit
split
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
elaborate
tribal
common
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
before
you
finish,
i
would
like
for
to
you
give
your
best
answer
to
a
lurking,
underlying
concern,
and
that
is
the
the
chief
justice
brought
up
the
outsider
subjected
to
courts
where
the
outsider
has
no
vote.
that
happens
when
you
sued
in
a
state
that's
not
your
own,
but
there
is
the
right
to
remove
and
also
at
the
end
of
the
line
is
this
court.
and
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
tribal
courts,
neither
of
those
exist.
there's
no...
you
can't
remove
to
a
state
or
federal
court,
and
this
court
has
no
review
authority
over
a
tribal
court's
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
the
same
faith
and
credit
that
it
would
give
to
a
sister
state
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
could
you
go
into
federal
court
under
what
was
in
farmers
and
say
we
had
no
jurisdiction
because
we
had
a
forum
selection
clause?
