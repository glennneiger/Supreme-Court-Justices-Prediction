chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
no.
07-411,
plains
commerce
bank
versus
long
family
land
and
cattle
company.
mr.
banker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
is
a
tribe
supposed
to
do?
let's
say
there
is
a
gas
station
on
the
reservation.
the
tribe
has
a
tax.
anybody
doing
business...
it's,
you
know,
1
percent
of
gross
proceeds.
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
gas
station
owner
says,
well,
i'm
just
not
going
to
pay
it.
what
do
they
do
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
there
would
be...
there
would
be
tribal-court
jurisdiction
in
the
case
i
hypothesized?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
case,
your
entire
case,
is
based
on
whether
or
not
there's
consent
to
dealing
with
the
tribe
by
the
nonmember?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
a
state
distinguish
when
it
grants
a
corporation
status
between
non-indian
and
indian
corporations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
clients
could
they
fully
protect
themselves.
what
if
the
tribe
sought
to
enforce
tribal
law
against
them,
can
they
bring
that
claim
in
state
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
well,
just
like
this
and
there
was
a
choice
of
forum
provision,
says,
well,
you've
got
to
bring
this
in
state
court.
i
thought
there
were
restrictions
on
whether
or
not
tribal
law
can
be
enforced
in
state
courts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
it...
well,
that's
if
it's
a
contract
claim.
what
if
it's
a
discrimination
or
indian
common
law
claim
arising
out
of
the
contractual
relationship?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
do
i
look
that
up
in
tribal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry;
i
don't
understand.
i'm
looking
at
joint
appendix
191
to
192.
you
have
special
interrogatories,
including
number
6
but
also
number
4
and
then
they
have
damages.
and
it's
not
clear
whether
those
damages
are
based
on
the
finding
of
liability
under
4
or
6.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
wrote
that?
you
gave
us
the
benefit
of
the
author
of
the
ninth
circuit,
but
not
the
first.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
presumably,
tribal...
whatever
tribal
precedent
there
may
be,
as
well.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
neither
could...
and
neither
could
anybody,
right?
i
mean
if
anybody
could
find
it,
you
could.
it's
because
it's
not
published
anywhere,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
of
the
points
you
mentioned
earlier
is
that
this
is
an
indian
corporation,
and
that's
a
concept
i
don't
understand.
if
justices
scalia
and
alito
form
a
corporation,
is
that
an
italian
corporation?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
the
concept
of
a
minority-owned
or
an
indian-owned
corporation,
but
the
point
here
is
you
are
trying
to
say
that
the
corporation
is
a
member
of
the
tribe.
and
i
just
don't
know.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
the
state,
when
it
incorporated
this
entity,
said:
you're
a
different
type
of
corporation
than
every
other;
you're
an
indian
corporation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
a
normal...
i
guess
a
non-indian
or
non-italian
or
non-irish...
corporation
dealing
with
the
long
family
land
and
cattle
company
know
that
it
was
an
indian
corporation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--putting
apart
the
particulars
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
the
bia
says
that.
but
if
you're
a
bank
and
somebody
comes
in
and
says:
i'm
a
corporation;
i
would
like
a
loan,
is
the
bank
supposed
to
start
asking
questions
about
whether
there
are
indian
shareholders,
and
how
many,
and
all
of
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
should
have
a
check
box
on
their
loan
application
that
says:
are
you
an
indian?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
asking
you
about:
in
a
general
case,
let's
say
they
don't
require
bia
loan
guarantees.
they
require,
just
as
in
this
case,
collateral.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
am
sure
the
facts
here
matter.
i
have
a
hypothetical
question.
a
bank
dealing
with
an
indian-owned
corporation,
how
are
they
supposed
to
find
out,
or
may
they
find
out,
whether
it's
an
indian-owned
corporation,
particularly
when
under
your
approach,
when
they
do
form
that
contract,
they
are
subjecting
themselves
to
tribal-court
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
do
they
subject
themselves
to
tribal-court
jurisdiction
because
they
are
dealing
with,
as
you
call
it,
an
indian
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
if
the
bank
had
two...
two
different
types
of
loans,
in
one
situation
the
corporation
comes
to
the
bank.
it
is
an
indian
corporation,
if
there
is
such
a
thing;
and
the
bank
deals
with
it,
although
it
doesn't
know
that.
in
the
other
situation
are
the
facts,
as
you
suggest
here;
and
the...
dealing
through
the
normal,
collateral
consequences
and
operations
of
a
contract
with
a
bank,
they
want
to
know
the
collateral,
and
all
of
that,
that
constitutes
consent,
but
a
commercial
relationship
with
a
member
does
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
odd
sort
of
basis
on
which
to
predicate
jurisdiction.
we
usually...
when
you're
dealing
with
jurisdiction,
we
usually
look
for
a
bright-line
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
earlier...
i
am
sorry.
you
said
earlier
that
this
was
a
straightforward
application
of
montana?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
given
the
facts.
but
isn't
it
true
that
this
would
be
the
first
case
in
which
we
have
asserted
or
allowed
indian
tribal
jurisdiction
to
be
asserted
over
a
nonmember?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about...
what
about
their
point
that,
under
our
system,
governing
is
based
on
the
consent
of
the
governed,
and
in
this
case
the
bank
has
no
role
to
play
in
the
nature
or
establishment
of
the
court
to
which
they
are
being
subjected?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
and
i
suppose--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
tribal
law
has
certain
cultural
principles
such
as
fairness
and
equity
of
a
sort
that
aren't
recognized
under
federal
or
state
law
in
this
type
of
contractual
relationship?
does
that
preclude
the
state
court
from
giving
comity
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
agree
with
your
friend
mr.
frederick
that
montana
did
not
address
jurisdiction
over
a
nonmember
and
that
this
would
be
the
first
case
in
which
we'd
recognize
such
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
happens
if
the
bank
deals
with
a
corporation
that
is
not
an
indian
corporation,
and
then
that...
the
shareholders
of
that
corporation
sell
their
shares
to
indians?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
bank
now
have
a
consensual
relationship
with
an
indian
corporation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
only
reason...
the
only
reason
the
bank
is
on
the
reservation
is
because
the
land
was
collateral,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
didn't
want
to
buy
land
on
a
reservation;
they
wanted
to
make
a
loan
and
get
the
interest
or
whatever,
and
it
just
turned
out
that
the
indians
defaulted,
and
therefore
they
were
left
with
a
land
on
a
reservation.
is
that
consensual?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
it's
a
different...
the
indian...
the
corporation
is
owned
by
members
on
the
reservation,
the
collateral
they
put
up
is
off
the
reservation,
is
there
consensual
dealings
with
the
corporation
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
subject
of
the
contract
is
loan
to
a
corporation
owned
by
indians
on
the
reservation.
the
collateral
put
up
is
other
land
that
the
corporation
owns
or
the
individuals
own
off
the
reservation.
jurisdiction
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess,
what
i
meant,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
subject
of
the
contract?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
home
equity
loan
for
home
on
the
reservation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whatever
home
equity
loans
are
for.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
they
are
going
to
add...
add
a
new
wing
onto
the...
new
room
on
to
their
home.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
chase
manhattan
gets
a
home
equity
loan
application
from
somebody
and
they
grant
the
home
equity
loan,
they
are
now
subject
to
being
sued
in
tribal
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
tribal
court
has
a
rule
that
forum
selection
provisions
are
not
enforceable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
the
judgment
here
that
the
bank
discriminated
against
the
indian
corporation
because
they
didn't
give
them
as
favorable
terms
as
they
gave
someone
who
hadn't
defaulted
on
a
loan
impede
dealings
with
indian
corporations
by
outside
members...
outside
nonmembers?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
was
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
discrimination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
had
nothing
to
do...
the
bank's
justification
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
entity
had
defaulted
earlier?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
banker,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
07-411,
plains
commerce
bank
versus
long
family
land
and
cattle
company.
this
is
a
case
about
how
--
how
far
indian
tribal
courts
may
go
in
exercising
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
the
issue
is
of
day-to-day
significance
in
the
western
part
of
our
country.
indian
tribes
have
long
occupied
a
unique
place
in
our
constitutional
system.
they
are
distinct
political
communities,
exercising
many
of
the
powers
and
prerogatives
of
self-government.
tribal
courts
are
a
part
of
that
self-government.
these
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
tribal
members
to
enforce
tribal
laws.
tribal
courts
generally
do
not,
however,
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
now,
our
cases
have
recognized
two
limited
exceptions
to
that
general
rule.
first,
we
have
held
that
a
tribe
may
regulate
the
activities
of
nonmembers
who
enter
consensual
relationships
with
the
tribe
or
its
members
through
commercial
dealings,
contracts,
leases,
or
other
arrangements.
second,
a
tribe
may
exercise
civil
authority
over
the
conduct
of
non-indians
within
the
reservation
when
that
conduct
threatens
or
has
some
direct
effect
on
the
political
integrity,
the
economic
security,
or
the
health
or
welfare
of
the
tribe.
we
call
these
exceptions
the
'montana
exceptions'
after
the
name
of
the
case
that
first
articulated
them.
this
case
involves
the
sale
of
land
owned
by
a
non-indian
bank
on
a
reservation.
now,
you
may
be
wondering
how
a
non-indian
bank
ended
up
owning
land
on
a
reservation.
well,
not
all
land
within
the
boundaries
of
a
reservation
is
owned
by
the
tribe.
some
of
it
is
owned
by
private
parties,
both
indians
and
non-indians.
that's
because
over
a
century
ago,
congress
decided
that
tribes
should
be
allowed
to
sell
portions
of
tribal
land.
congress
reversed
that
policy
some
years
later,
but
the
land
that
was
sold
still
remains
in
private
hands
today
even
though
it
is
within
the
reservation.
the
bank
in
this
case
had
dealings
within
an
indian
couple,
the
longs
and
a
company
that
the
longs
owned
on
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
reservation.
that
reservation
is
some
11
million
acres
in
south
dakota.
the
bank
provided
the
longs
and
their
company
loans
and
had
other
commercial
dealings
with
them.
the
bank
eventually
acquired
from
the
estate
for
mr.
long's
father
who
was
not
an
indian,
a
partial
of
fee
land,
land
that
was
not
owned
by
the
tribe.
the
longs
had
an
option
to
purchase
that
long
from
the
bank,
but
could
not
exercise
the
option.
the
bank
then
sold
the
parcel
to
a
non-indian
couple
and
the
longs
sued
the
bank
in
tribal
court.
they
alleged
that
the
bank
had
discriminated
against
them
by
offering
the
non-indian
couple
more
favorable
terms
than
those
offered
to
them
in
the
option
to
purchase.
the
bank
argued
that
the
tribe
had
no
jurisdiction.
after
all,
the
bank
was
not
an
indian
company
and
the
land
at
issue
was
not
an
indian
land.
but
the
tribal
court
ruled
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction
and
ultimately
found
in
favor
of
the
longs'
awarding
them
$750,000
and
reviving
the
option
to
purchase
in
their
favor.
that
decision
was
upheld
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
we
conclude
that
the
tribe
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
reverse.
by
allowing
the
long's
claim
to
go
forward,
the
tribal
court
effectively
regulated
the
terms
on
which
non-indians
could
sell
non-indian
land.
now,
remember
the
tribes
cannot
regulate
non-indians
at
all,
unless
one
of
the
montana
exceptions
applies,
neither
does
in
this
case.
those
exceptions
allow
regulation
within
limits
of
what
non-indians
do
on
the
reservation,
that’s
because
certain
activities
by
non-indians
may
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
tribe
and
its
members.
but
simply
selling
fee
land
is
not
a
conduct
or
an
activity
that
has
such
effects.
the
tribe
lost
general
authority
over
the
land
itself
when
the
land
was
sold
from
the
tribe
to
non-indians
at
the
time
such
sales
could
be
made.
once
the
land
has
been
sold
in
fee
simple
and
passed
beyond
the
tribe's
control,
the
mere
resale
of
the
land
to
another
person
works
no
additional
intrusion
on
tribal
relations
or
self-government.
now,
this
does
not
mean
of
course
that
the
bank
is
free
to
discriminate
on
an
impermissible
basis.
state
and
federal
governments
can
and
do
regulate
the
bank.
what
it
does
mean
is
that
the
non-indian
bank
cannot
be
held
into
tribal
court
for
its
sale
of
non-indian
land.
the
contrary
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part,
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
that
opinion
is
joined
by
justice
stevens,
justice
souter,
and
justice
breyer.
