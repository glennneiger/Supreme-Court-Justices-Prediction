mr.
paul
a.
banker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
tribes
lack
inherent
sovereign
power
over
nonmembers.
this
court
in
the
montana
decision
recognized
two
narrow
exceptions
based
on
the
underlying
principles
of
protecting
tribal
self-government
and
controlling
internal
relations.
neither
of
those
exceptions
applies
here.
the
question
today
is
whether
the
tribal
court
possessed
adjudicatory
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
longs'
discrimination
claim
against
the
nonmember
bank.
it
did
not.
there
was
no
qualifying
consensual
relationship
here
of
the
qualifying
kind.
there
was...
adjudication
is
not
another
means
of
regulating
nonmember
defendant
conduct.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
the
reason
that
it
would
be
different
for
indian
law
is
the
way
that
it
bears
on
the
nonmember
defendants'
rights.
the...
if
you
look
at
what
montana
was
based
on
and
the
underlying
principles,
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
nonmember
defendants
in
tribal
court,
finding
themselves
there
to
adjudicate,
that
is
something
that
i
think
was
contemplated
by
the
second
exception,
but
not
the
first
exception.
the
reason
that
i
think
that
is
that
in
carving
out
two
exceptions--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
that
it
is
different
in
the
tribal-law
context
because
in
articulating
the...
the
first
exception
when
the
court
said:
regulate
nonmember
conduct
through
other
means,
if
the
court
had
meant
to
say
"adjudication",
i
think
the
court
could
have
articulated
that
there.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--when
i
look
at
the...
you
know,
at
the...
and
compare
the
language
in
the
first
montana
exception
of
regulation
to
the
language
in
the
constitution
under
the
indian
commerce
clause,
i
see
a
parallel
there
between
saying
that,
you
know,
there
are
certain
types
of
legislative
authority
that
tribes
may
exercise
over
nonmembers
versus
exercising
the
power
of
the
courts.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
think
that
has
been
well
established:
that
the
regulatory--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--well,
i
think
that
there's
a
tension
between
what
the
court
said
in
the
strate
case,
where
it
said,
presumptively,
if
there
is
the
power
to
regulate,
then
there
is
presumptively
the
power
to
adjudicate.
that,
i
believe,
was
called
into
question
by
the
second
footnote
in
the
nevada
versus
hicks
decision,
which
questioned,
in
my
mind,
whether
or
not
there
was
any
adjudicatory
power
at
all.
and
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
has
to
determine,
is
whether--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--well,
there
was
a...
the
footnote
number
2
in
hicks
at
least
called
into
question
about
whether
or
not...
you
know,
i
think
it's
been
made
clear
by
the
court's
opinions
that...
that
adjudicatory
authority
is
certainly
no
broader
than
legislative
authority.
the
question
raised
by
the
second
footnote
in
the
hicks
opinion,
in
my
mind,
is
whether
or
not
adjudicatory
authority
exists
at
all
in
the
first
exception.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
situations
where
there
is
a
clear
ability
to
regulate
and
where
you
would
move
to
enforce
that
regulation
and
a
situation
where
you
are
adjudicating,
you
know,
separate
claims
under
the
common
law
of
the
tribe.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
nature
of
the
first
exception
is
a
consensual
relationship.
and
i
think
if
there
is
going
to
be
an
ability
to
regulate
in
the
first
instance,
then
the
regulation
needs
to
be
clearly
consented
to.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that.
if
i
could...
you
know,
in
your
example
of
the
taxation,
if
there
was
clear
consent
to
be
taxed--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--well,
but
by
engaging
in
commerce
on
the
reservation
and
by,
you
know...
and
this
court
has
addressed
it
in
a
number
of
taxation
decisions
regarding
indian
law,
the...
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
for--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--but
that...
you
know,
in
the
taxation
context,
i
think
that
is
the
price
of
doing
business.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
it
is,
you
know,
that
consent
under
the
first
montana
exception
can't
be
implicit.
i
think
it
needs
to
be
explicit.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
we
need
to
be
specific
about
the
taxation
context.
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
any
taxation
context
would
carry
with
it
implicit
consent.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
mean
in
that
situation,
if
the
tribe
said,
here
is
the
licensing
that
we
are
going
to
impose
on
you
for
being
a
mechanic,
and
the
mechanic
then
went
to
work
at
that
gas
station,
knowing
about
that
licensing
requirement,
i
mean,
that
is...
that
is
the
sort
of
actual--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
it
comes--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would...
i
would
disagree
that...
i
would
say
that
those
examples
of
consent
of
the
licensing
of
the
taxation
are
much
closer
to
being
actual
consent.
i'm
not
saying
by
"actual
consent"
that
there
needs
to
be
a
written
document
that
says--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--well,
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
the...
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
a
line
drawn.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
the
reason
where
we
would
draw
the
line
where
i
want
to
drawn
it
is
that,
you
know,
the
discrimination
claim
that
was
made
here
ultimately
turned
out
to
be
based
on
tribal
common
law.
it
arose
out
of
this...
the
dealings,
the
contractual
dealings,
between
the
bank
and
a
nonmember
corporation.
it
is
important
for
a
nonmember
to
know
where
tribal
jurisdiction
attaches
or
doesn't
attach.
and
it
is
not
possible
to
predict
when
a
common
law,
tribal...
for
an
outsider
to
determine
when
a
tribal
common-law
discrimination
claim
is
going
to
attach
as
a
form
of
regulation--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--if
it
had
been
a
tribal
antidiscrimination
statute,
there
would
have
at
least
been
the
possibility
of
notice
and
the
possibility
of--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
what
is
required
to
bind
a
nonmember
to
tribal
law
is
clear
consent,
and
merely
knowing
about
the
tribal
antidiscrimination--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i...
i
think
that
it
does
make
a
difference.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
think--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
that
that
provides
the
clearest
guidance
for
when
tribal
jurisdiction
attaches
or
doesn't.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
that
is
so,
but,
you
know,
we're
not
here
to,
you
know...
the
federal
courts
don't
provide
a
substantive
review
on
the
merits.
there
is
certainly
another
side
to
the
story
about
the
merits
of
the
discrimination.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
no.
that's,
that's
not
uncommon.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
background
about,
out
of
which
this
discrimination
claim
arose.
and,
you,
know
it
began
in
the
first
instance
with
the
bank,
a
nonmember,
entering
into
a
contract
with
a
south
dakota
corporation.
and
the
south
dakota
corporation,
the
long
family
land
and
cattle
company,
is
not
a
tribal
member,
cannot
be--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--it
is
closely
held
by
tribal
members.
and
it
is
organized
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
bureau
of
indian
affairs
loan--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
you
cannot
incorporate
under
tribal
law.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
you
have
to
be
specific
about
the
loan
guarantees
and
the
contracts
that
we
are
talking
about.
before
1996,
before
the
loan
contracts
that
are
at
issue
here,
there
were
lending
relationships
and
loan
guarantees
that
were
made.
and
after
1996,
when
additional
loans
were
made,
there
were
personal
guarantees
that
were
made.
there
was
no
attempt
ever
to
enforce
those
personal
guarantees,
but
they
were
part
of
the
record.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
believe
it
is
certainly
51
percent.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
there
is
a
question
about
whether
it's
more.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
there
is
no
question
that
this
whole
question
would
have
been
avoided
had
there
been
a
choice
of
forum
selection
that
placed
the
dispute
resolution
squarely
in
south
dakota
courts.
in
the
absence
of
that,
in
the
silence
of
that--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
that
in
the
face
of
silence
in
the
contract,
the
general
rule
controls
rather
than
its
exceptions.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
if
the
tribe
or
if
the
tribal
members
sought
to
enforce
that?
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
it's
the
question
of
who
the
plaintiff
is
if
the
long
family
land
and
cattle
company,
the
south
dakota
corporation,
had
had
a
contract
with
the
bank
that
said
your
forum
for
dispute
resolution
is
south
dakota
courts,
and
the
long
family
land
and
cattle
company
had
commenced
an
action
in
south
dakota
courts,
i
think
the
dispute
could
have
been
resolved
there.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
that's
a
more
difficult
question.
you
know,
there
was...
it
isn't
part
of
the
question
presented,
but
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
underlying
tribal
court
about
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
claim,
whether
it
rose
under
federal
law
or
what
was
its
underlying
basis.
that
was
resolved
in
favor
of
it
being
a
tribal
law
claim.
as
i
understand
the
tribal
court
of
appeals'
explanation
of
that
on
an
underlying
basis
that
there
is
little
difference
between
the
tribal
law
claim
and
the
underlying
federal
discrimination
law.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
is
it
a--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--no.
i
believe
that
the
discrimination--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--it
is
a
freestanding
tort
action.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
we
have
to
look
at,
you
know,
who
were
the
contracting
parties.
the
contracting
parties
were
the
bank
on
the
one
hand
and
the
long
family
land
and
cattle
company
on
the
other.
so
the
individual
tribal
members
i
don't
believe
would
have
had
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
don't
think
that
the
long
family
and
cattle
company
appropriately
was
a
plaintiff
in
tribal
court
to
sue
on
breach
of
contract.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
don't
think
so
without
some
sort
of
consent
to
hearing
that.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
the
long
company
was
a
plaintiff
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
because
of
the
way
that
the
case
was
tried.
if
you
look
at
the
general
verdict
form
at
page
192...
191
and
192
in
the
joint
appendix,
you'll
see
that
the
jury...
the
tribal
court
jury
was
asked
interrogatories
about
liability:
liability
for
contract,
liability
for
discrimination.
when
they
got
to
question
6
on
page
192,
the
question
was
asked
of
the
jury
if
you
answered
"yes"
to
question
four
for
the
other
liability
questions,
four
being
the
discrimination
claim,
then
award
damages.
and
so
the
jury
awarded
$750,000
of
undifferentiated
damages.
whether
it
was
for
contract,
whether
it
was
for
tort
is
not
for
us
to
now
second-guess.
there
was
a
general
award
of
damages.
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
could
award
damages
for
breach...
for
discrimination.
so,
you
know,
that
is
a
feature
of
how
the
case
was
tried.
it
is
a
feature
of
the
way
that
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
and
at
this
point
it's
impossible
to
know...
the
$750,000
that
was
ultimately
awarded
was
far
less
than
what
the
longs
were
asking
for
for
breach
of
contract,
and
they
didn't
say
they
were
not
asking
for
damages
for
discrimination
in
the
tribal...
in
the
tribal
court.
so
for
this
court
to
say
now
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
discrimination
claim
would
basically
invalidate
that
underlying
judgment.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
what
montana
said,
the
actual
language
of
montana
said
a
tribe
may
regulate
through
taxation,
licensing
or
other
means
the
activities
of
nonmembers
who
enter
consensual
relationships
with
the
tribe
or
its
members,
through
commercial
dealings,
contracts,
leases
or
other
arrangements.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
mean,
my
interpretation
of
that
is...
i
mean,
montana
in
its
first
exception
meant
that
the
consent
was
in
the
consensual
relationship,
then
any
business
dealings
with
the
tribe
or
its
members
would
result
in
tribal
ability
to
regulate,
and
that
hasn't
been
the
case,
as
this
court
has,
you
know,
decided--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--not
in
the
actual
language
of
montana,
but
in
reading
strate
and
in
reading
hicks
and
in
reading
atkinson
trading
company,
that
is
my
interpretation
of
the--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
true,
but
i
think
strate
is
an
important
part
of
that
history.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
what's
left
of
the
first
exception
is
certainly
a
tribal
ability
to
regulate,
and
perhaps
that's
all.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
i
think
the
first
exception
could
still
have
meaning,
in
the
sense
that
it
grants
the
tribe
the
ability
to
regulate.
the
question
really
is
how
far
does
that
ability
go
and
how
far
does
it
stretch.
i
don't
think
that
it
stretches
to
adjudication,
and
i
further
don't
think
it
stretches
to
adjudication
of
nonconsensual
tort
claims.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
think
when
you
step
back
in
listening
to
the
arguments
of
opposing
counsel,
you
know,
what
is
the
other
way
that
tribal
courts
get...
that
the
tribes
get
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers?
well,
congress
can
provide
it.
and
if
we
look
at
this
bureau
of
indian
affairs
loan
guaranty
program,
which
congress
authorized,
congress
didn't
provide
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers
in
implementation
of
that
program.
so
you've
got
an
elaborate
loan
program
and
it's
designed
to
provide
capital
to
tribes
and
tribal
members,
and
congress
is
silent
on
that.
now,
in
other
instances
congress
has
provided
authorization
for
tribal
courts
and
tribes
to
have
jurisdiction
over
nonmembers.
congress
is
aware
of
this
court's
opinion
in
montana
presumably
and
the
cases
that
follow
from
it,
but
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
loan
guaranty
program
congress
remained
silent.
what
do
we
infer
from
that?
i
think
it
is
crucial
when
you
think
about
nonmember
defendants
in
tribal
court
and
whether
they
can
have
their
rights
adjudicated
there
to
think
about
the
structural
problems,
the
lack
of
a
right
to
remove,
the
lack
of
a
right
to
have
this
court
provide
a
substantive
review.
there
is
no--
mr.
paul
a.
banker
--i
think
that
the...
you
know,
the
tribal
courts
stand
outside
of
the
federal...
of
the
federal-state
relationship.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
due
process.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
equal
protection.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
well,
that's
exactly
the
point.
i
mean
it
is
the
due
process
right
of
the
nonmember.
mr.
paul
a.
banker
i
think
the
difference
is
the
constitutional
protections
of
nonmembers
do
not
apply
down
to
tribal
courts.
