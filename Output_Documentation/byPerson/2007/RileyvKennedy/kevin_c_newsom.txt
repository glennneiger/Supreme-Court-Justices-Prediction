mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
presents
two
issues,
both
a
threshold
jurisdictional
question
and
a
substantive
question
concerning
scope
of
section
5.
we
have
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
briefs
why
governor
riley's
appeal
in
this
case
is
timely
and
why
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
resolve
the
merit.
the
solicitor
general
has
agreed
with
us
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
certainly
want
to
answer
any
questions
that
the
court
may
have
concerning
the
jurisdictional
issue,
but
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
proceed
in
my
affirmative
presentation
directly
to
the
merits,
and
specifically
the
second
of
two
independent
bases
that
we
have
urged
for
reversal
here.
our
argument
under
this
court's
decision
in
young
versus
fordice
is
perhaps
the
simplest
and
most
straightforward
way
to
resolve
this
case.
in
young,
this
court
held
that
a
state
voter
registration
plan,
despite
its
promulgation,
preclearance
and
active
implementation
to
register
4,000
voters,
was
nonetheless
in
force
or
effect
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
and
thus
was
not
a
valid
section
5
baseline
for
purposes
of
measuring
future
changes,
because
the
court
said
it
resulted
only
from
a
temporary
misapplication
of
state
law
and
it
was
immediately
corrected
upon
acknowledgment
that
it
was
unlawful
in
fact.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
your
honor,
i
don't
think...
your
honor
is
correct
that
the
only
possible
distinction
between
young
and
this
case
is
the
holding
of
the
1987
election,
but
i
don't
think
the
election
can
make
the
difference
here,
for
this
reason:
it
preceded
solely
by
virtue
of
the
vagaries
of
the
state
litigation
process.
the
challenge
preceded
the
election
by
two
months.
that
election
was
conducted
under
a
cloud
of
litigation
that
everyone
certainly
knew
about
and
it
went
forward
only
because,
in
the
wake
of
young,
the
trial
court
temporarily
misapplied
state
law.
if
a
trial
court
had
gotten
state
law
right
to
begin
with,
your
honor,
and
had
enjoined
the
election
as
we
now
all
know
it
should
have,
then
there
never
would
have
been
the
election
to
point
to
as
evidence
that
85-237
ever
went
into
force
or
effect.
and
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable,
consistent
with
any
meaningful
notion
of
federalism,
that
section
5
can
require
a
world
in
which
a
state
trial
court,
as
we
say
in
the
reply
brief,
which
exists
at
the
bottom
of
the
state
judicial
hierarchy,
can
by
getting
state
law
wrong
in
the
first
place
lock
into
state
law
as
a
section
5
baseline
an
unconstitutional
statute.
i
don't
anybody,
on
this
side
of
the
podium
anyway,
to
be
denying
that
85-237
was,
is
now
and
was
at
its
inception,
unconstitutional
and
thereby
strip
the
alabama
supreme
court
of
its
sovereign
prerogative
to
correct
the
errors
of
lower
courts.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
right.
there
are...
we
have
pitched
two
different
arguments
in
this
case,
your
honor.
and
under
the,
i
think
it's
fair,
to
say
the
broader
of
the
two
arguments,
contained
in
roman
ii
of
our
brief,
that,
the
later
action,
nonetheless
would
not
be
a
change
under
section
5.
but
under
the
argument
that
i
was
talking
about
specifically
under
young
versus
fordice,
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
stepped
in
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
to
invalidate
this
statute,
again
as
part
of
litigation
that
preceded
the
first
and
only
implementation,
attempted
implementation,
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
question
at
bottom
here
in
this
case
is
whether
section
5
provides
state
courts
with
any
breathing
space
whatsoever
in
which
to
conduct
this
exercise
of
judicial
review,
and
our
submission
is
that
at
the
very
least
that
it
ought
to
extend
so
far
as
to
allow
state
courts
to
step
in,
as
they
did
here,
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i'm
not
frankly--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
part
of
the
point
that
we've
emphasized
here
as
one
of
the
key
federalism
issues
in
this
case,
is
that
this
case
really
does
in
a
very
functional
way
strip
state
courts
of
their
jurisdiction
to
exercise
judicial
review,
whether
at
the
trial
court
stage
or
at
the
supreme
court
stage
because
on
appellee's
theory
once
the
statute
is
precleared
it
is
effectively
locked
in
place
and
that
the
trial
court
or
the
supreme
court
needs
permission
from
the
executive
branch
in
washington
to
exercise
the
authority
to--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
to
be
sure
the
appellees
are
correct
that
it
is
the
administration
of
the
change
itself
that
requires
preclearance.
so
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
our
position
here
is
that
courts
are
having
to...
to
render
sort
of
provisional
judgments
that
are
then
subject
to
preclearance
in
washington.
the
point
is
that,
so
i
think
in
the
redistricting
example,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
implementation
of
the
redistricting
that
would
require
preclearance.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
no
your
honor,
and
the
point
is
that
no
one
here
denies,
certainly
the
state
does
not
deny,
that
a
state
court
order
redistricting,
redrawing
a
map,
in
essence,
and
giving
rise
or
exercising
what
is
functionally,
as
this
court
has
said,
a
legislative
power
requires
redistricting.
no
one
doubts
that.
but
the
question
here
is
quite
different:
whether
if
there
is
a
spectrum
of
state
court
decisions
with
redistricting
at
one
end,
my
case
has
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
and
i
will
confess
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
right
off
the
top
of
my
mind
that
fit
that
paradigm.
but
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
only--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that
might
be
right,
justice
souter,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
implications
for
this
case.
if
you
could--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
i
think
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
this
court
has
said
in
construing
section
5
that
it
will
not
construe
it
so
as
to
exacerbate
federalism
costs.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
federalism
costs
are
exacerbated
here
is
that
this
is...
this
scenario
is
simply
unlike
any,
as
we
say
in
the
brief,
that
this
court
has--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
it's
certainly
true,
your
honor,
that
when
a
state
court,
as
any
court...
as
this
court
made
clear
only
last
month
in
danforth,
when
a
court
exercises
judicial
review
to
invalidate
a
practice
that's
unconstitutional
it
is
not
changing
or
making
new
law
as
it
goes
along,
but
declaring
what
the
law
has
always
been.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
my
case
is
the
latter
situation,
where
there
was
technically
a
law
in
place.
85-257
to
be
sure
was
in
place.
now,
whether
it
was
in
force
or
effect
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
young
is
different,
but
it
was
in
place.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
precleared
virtually
immediately,
so
let's
say
in
'85.
i
don't
remember
the
month
specifically,
but
it
was
precleared
in
'85.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
submitted
by
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
right.
the
litigation
was
commenced
in
april
of
1987.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
for
purposes
of
this
litigation.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
that's
true,
but
of
course
courts
don't
get
to
reach
out
and
grab
the
disputes
and
bring
them
into
courts.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
it...
but
the
challenge
here
would
not
have
been
ripe
until
1987.
there
was
no
vacancy
on
the
horizon.
and
so
the
challenge
here
was
brought
at
the
earliest
conceivable
opportunity
when
the
vacancy
became
a
reality.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think
that's
entirely
possible,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
justice
department's
regulations
at
51.22,
your
honor,
say
that
they
will
not
preclear
things
that
are
not
final
and
that
are
subject,
it
says,
to
revision
by
court...
by
court
judgment.
but
that
regulation
is
specific,
the
federal
register
says--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
truth
is
the
regulations
don't
speak
specifically
to
that
question,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
regulations
are
quite
clear
in
the
federal
register
at
46
federal
register
872
that
they
don't
deal
with
changes,
so
called,
brought
about
as
a
result
of
court
judgments.
the
regulation
that
i
was
referring
to,
51.22,
refers
specifically
to
state
courts
having
an
administrative
role
to
play
in--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's
right,
redistricting,
reannexation.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
no,
your
honor,
not
right
off...
not
as
i'm
standing
here,
i
don't.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
but
the
point...
justice
ginsburg,
getting
back
to
your
point
so
you'll
appreciate
the
timeline,
in
april
of
1987
the
challenge
is
brought.
in
june
of
1987
the
election
goes
forward.
so
the
challenge
here
preceded
the
election
by
two
months.
and
the
point
that
i've
been
trying
to
make
is
that
the...
had
the
trial
court
gotten
state
law
right
to
begin
with
and
enjoined
the
election,
as
we
now
know
it
should
have,
there
never
would
have
been
an
election
to
point
to,
to
show
within
the
meaning
of
young
that
the...
that
the
statute
was
ever
put
into
force
and
effect.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
yes.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
the
truth
is,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
what--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--your
honor,
the
difference,
or
what
makes
this
case
just
like
young
versus
fordice,
is
that
the
relevant...
the
relevant
implementation
in
young
was
not
election.
the
relevant
implementation
in
young
was
registration.
and
this
court's
opinion
makes
clear
that
4,000
real,
live
flesh
and
blood
voters
were
registered.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
with
respect,
your
honor--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--no,
i
can't--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--tell
you
as
i'm
standing
here
that
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that
the
appointment
was
retroactive,
but
i
do
think
that,
given
the
nature
of
the
implementation,
the
relevant
implementation
in
young
being
registration,
the
fact
that
4,000
people
were
registered
does
bring
this
case
pretty
close
to
young.
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--with
respect
to
that,
your
honor,
it's
that
i
don't
think
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
this
was
the
governor's
plan.
the
governor
was
not--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--right.
and--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
shorthand
misses
the
fact
here
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
that
the
change
results
here
from
a
state
court
exercising
judicial
review.
and
this
is...
that
is
different
in
kind
from
any
sort
of
decision
that
this
court
has
ever
rendered
about--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
that--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--so
the
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
result
of
that
court
decision
would
have
been
immediately
enjoined
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
fifteenth
amendment,
or
section
2.
the
point
about
section
5--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--absolutely.
this
court
would
have
cert
jurisdiction
if
there
were...
if
you
have
the--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--if
i...
if
i
may,
justice
breyer,
as
a
preface
it's
important
that
i
emphasize
simply
as
sort
of
a
superstructure
point
here
that
as...
not
only
as
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
but
as
the
party
asking
the
court
to
exacerbate
federalism
costs,
within
the
meaning
of
bossier
parish,
over
what
they
have
been
to
this
point,
i
think
it's
my
opponents'
burden
to
show
you
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
include
these
provisions,
as
opposed
to
my
burden
to
show
you
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
them.
that's
essentially
what
this
court
said
in
gregory
versus
ashcroft.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
i
think
there
are...
if
i
can
answer
in
two
parts.
first
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
to
be
sure
the
appellees
and
their
amici
have
brought
forward
a
number
of
examples
of
state
court
judges,
principally
southern
state
court
judges,
doing
some
pretty
despicable
stuff,
and
i'm
not
here
to
defend
that.
but
with
respect
to
the
specific
question
at
issue
here,
whether
congress
was
in
enacting
section
5,
was
clued
into
this
question
and
it
had
reason
to
think
that
state
court
exercises
of
judicial
review
would
give
rise
to
the
sorts
of
problems
that
section
5
was
designed
to
inhibit,
there
simply
is
nothing
to
support
that
suggestion.
section
5,
of
course,
was
intended
to
do
something
very
specific.
it
was
designed
to
prevent
or
to
catch
government
conduct
that
the
more
traditional
remedies
in
place
at
the
time
under
the
'57,
'60
and
'64
civil
rights
acts,
what
we
would
today
i
think
call
a
section
2
suit,
couldn't
get.
and
the
point
here,
in
addition
to
the
danforth
that
at
some
deep
jurisprudential
level
courts
don't
change
law,
the
more
important
practical
point
is
that
courts
exercising
judicial
review
are
institutionally
incapable
of
changing
the
law
specifically
in
the
way
that
congress
was
concerned
about
when
it
enacted
section
5.
congress--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--that's
right,
your
honor.
there
are
two
sort
of
different
things
going
on
here.
one,
as
a
matter
again
of
the
appellees'
burden
to
show
you
that
these
decisions
are
clearly
included
within
the
text,
quite
clearly
they
are
not,
because
november
1,
1964,
as
your
honor
quite
correctly
points
out--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--with
respect,
what
i
say
at
page
8
of
the
reply
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
determine
specifically
how
the
november
1,
1964,
language
ought
to
operate
in
the
legislative
and
administrative
change
scenario.
this
court
in
presley
and
again
in
young
versus
fordice
has
suggested
in
dicta
that
perhaps
the
baseline
might
float,
notwithstanding
the
november
1,
1964--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--no.
you're...
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor,
perhaps
not.
and
this
again
goes
to
the
burden
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier.
my...
the
sole
purpose
in
citing
the
november
1,
1964,
language
is
to
show
that
at
the
very
least,
to
the
extent
you're
looking
for
some
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
get
these
decisions,
the
text
cannot
provide
that
clear
indication.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
that's
right.
there
are
different
lines
the
court
might
choose
to
draw.
this
case
at
most
presents
a
question
where
a
court
is
exercising
the
power
of
judicial
review
to
invalidate
a
previously
precleared
statute.
it
might
decide
the
case
more
narrowly,
as
i
said,
under
young
versus
fordice,
on
a
more
fact
specific
basis.
but
at
the
very
most,
the
court
would
need
to
decide
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
court
exercises
a
judicial
review
to
invalidate
previously
precleared
practices
as
compliant
with
section
5
do
not
give
rise
to
section
5
changes.
and,
chief
justice
roberts,
just
to
get
back
to
the
textual
piece
of
this,
we
have,
pointed,
in
addition
to
the
1,
1964,
language,
we
have
also
pointed
to
the
provision
in
section
5
that
we
have
referred
to
as
the
savings
clause,
which
i
think
provides
good
reason
at
the
very
least
to
think
that
congress
was
thinking
about
court
decisions
enjoining
existing
baselines
differently
from
the
way
it
was
thinking
about
the
typical
legislative
and
administrative
changes
that
have
been
the
grist
of
this
court's
section
5
jurisprudence.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
it
would
be
the
governor's
option,
your
honor,
whether
to...
to
do
what
was
done
in
1987
or
8,
i
suppose,
and
to
install
the
winner
of
the
election
or
to
reinstate
juan
chastang
to
his
position.
i
have
not
discussed
with
the
governor
what
his
specific
intentions
would
be
with
respect
to
that.
but
it
would
be
his
option
to
take
one
of
those
two
courses
under
the
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
your
honor,
if
we
are
talking
about
a
legislative
or
administrative
change,
the
answer
may
well
be
no
under
this
court's
dicta.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
i
think
that,
your
honor,
if
you're
going
to
treat
all
forms
of
changes
together,
then
they
may
well
be
able
to.
although
i
would
say
this,
that
that
will
very
rarely,
if
ever,
be
the
case.
this
is
sort
of
the
odd
ball
case
in
which
the
reversion
happens
to
be--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--well,
i
think
the
explanation
for
19...
for
november
1,
1964
is
section
5
was
implemented
as
a
five
year
stopgap
measure.
it's
now
been
extended
through
2031
with
no
amendment
of
the
language.
so
it
might
have
made
some
sense
as
a
hard
requirement
in
1964.
it
makes
much
less
practical
sense,
i
recognize,
today.
but
the
language
is
what
the
language
is
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
the
plaqueities
is
gubernatorial
appointment.
it
doesn't
strike
me
that
the
underlying
method
of
how
the
election
might
have
operated
if
the
rule
were
election
should
matter,
the
rule
was
gubernatorial
appointment.
the
rule
is
by
virtue
of
these
decisions
gubernatorial
appointment.
if
i
may,
just
a
couple
of
housekeeping
items.
justice
ginsburg,
the
question
of
what
doj
was
asked
to
preclear
here
is
crystal
clear
from
the
district
court's
opinion.
on
august
18,
2006,
this
three
judge
court
held
that
two
alabama
supreme
court
decisions
stokes
v.
noonan
and
riley
v.
kennedy
must
be
precleared
before
they
can
be...
so
the
notion
that
the
state
was
not
asked
to
preclear
judicial
decisions
is
simply
incorrect.
the
second
thing
i'd
like
to
mention
just
briefly
is
that
the
federalism
exacerbation
here
exists
in
a
very
real
way
for
this
reason.
the
entire
legislative
and
litigation
history
of
section
5
has
been
about
legislative
and
administrative
change.
even
with
respect
to
those
sorts
of
changes,
this
court
has
said
most
recently
and
most
forcefully
in
presley
that
that
application
of
section
5
even
there
works
an
extraordinary
change
of
the
traditional
course
of
relations
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
so
the...
to
this
point
to
be
sure
the
court
has
been
willing
to
accept
that
extraordinary
departure.
the
question
in
this
case,
however,
is
whether
this
extraordinary
departure
ought
to
become
this
extraordinary
departure
to
account
for
this
new
category,
this
new
universe
of
changes.
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
pieces
of
this,
really.
that's
more
extraordinary
simply
in
a
quantitative
sense.
we
are
talking
about
a
lot
more
changes,
so
in
sheer
numbers
we
have
got
an
exacerbation.
but
it's
also
in
a
qualitative
sense
the
sense
that
we
are
living
in
a
post
marbury,
post
cooper
versus
aaron,
post
bernie
world
in
which
state
courts
just
like
federal
courts
are
tasked
with
finally
deciding
what
state
law
means.
and
so,
there
is
a
very
real
difference,
i
think,
in
upsetting
the
considered
judgment
of
a
state
court
with
respect
to
what
state
court...
with
respect
to
what
state
law
means
than
there
is--
mr.
kevin
c.
newsom
--right,
your
honor.
but
with
respect
i
think
that
that
doesn't
do
justice
to
the
functional
reality
of
what's
going
on
here.
in
1988
the
alabama
supreme
court
says,
may
i,
says
in
stokes
versus
noonan
that
85-237
is
and
always
was
unconstitutional.
we
have
an
issue
of
doctrine
that's
simply
part
of
alabama
law
and,
again,
i
don't
think
anybody
here
seriously
disputes
that
85-237
was
unconstitutional.
and
20
years
later
doj
steps
in
and
refuses
to
bless
that
determination,
and
to
be
sure,
is
not
meddling
around
in
the
intricacies
of
state
law
but
the
functional
equivalent
is
the
same.
they
set
that
judgment
aside,
and
notwithstanding
the
stokes
court
invalidation
of
that,
doj
says
very
clearly
in
its
objection
letters
that
85-237,
despite
its
invalidation,
remains
in
full
force
and
effect.
