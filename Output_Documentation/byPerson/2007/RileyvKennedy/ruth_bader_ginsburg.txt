justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
precleared
at
what
point?
the
1985
law
was
precleared
before
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
submitted
by?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
then
the
litigation
came.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
your
point
is
that
if
the
circuit
court...
there
are
only
two
levels
of
court
in
this,
the
circuit
court
and
the
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
newsom,
before
you
finish
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
about
what
action
governor
riley
would
take
if
you're
right
on
the
law?
that
is,
a
mistake
by
the
alabama
circuit
court
can't
invalidate
a
law
that
the
supreme
court
says
on
judicial
review
of...
on
review
of
the
circuit
court,
that
the
circuit
court
got
it
wrong.
the
first
time
around,
when
jones
was
elected
and
then
the
governor
mooted
any
controversy
by
just
appointing
him.
now
we
have
a
similar
situation.
we
have
somebody
who
has
won
an
election
overwhelmingly
against
the
person
that
the
governor
appointed.
there
are,
what,
five
months
left
in
the
term?
if
your
position
on
the
law
is
correct,
would
the
governor
in
fact
oust
the
person
who
was
a
four
to
one
1
winner
in
a
popular
election
and
install
the
person
who
was
a
loser
in...
would
that
happen?
could
we
project
based
on
what
happened
the
first
time
around
that
the
governor
would
not
so
thwart
the
will
of
the
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it
was
the
district
judge
that
made
alabama
go
to
the
preclearance
after
the
second--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
still,
if
you
take
this
case
at
its
essence,
a
circuit
court
got
alabama
law
wrong
and
that's
what
you
say
counts
as
to
make
the
law
operative.
the
law
becomes
operative
because
an
alabama
intermediate
court
or
trial
court
made
a
wrong
decision
about
alabama
law;
and
then
when
the
supreme
court
corrects
it,
that
doesn't
count.
that's
essentially
your
position,
that
they're
locked,
alabama
is
locked
into
a
mistake
that
was
made
about
alabama
law
by
that
circuit
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
a
review
of
a
lower
court
by
a
higher
court.
that's
what
higher
courts
do.
they
review
for
correctness,
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
the
circuit
court
got
it
wrong.
it
misconstrued
the
law,
and
we
are
correcting
that.
and
that's...
that's
correct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
federal
court
told
the
alabama--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
told
alabama.
i
thought...
i
thought
that
one
of
the
reasons
was
adjudication
wasn't
complete
when
the
district
court
made
its
first
ruling,
so
the
district
court
said,
now,
go
off
and
get
those
two
alabama
supreme
court
decisions
precleared.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
they
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state's
position
was
it
shouldn't
have
to
preclear
a
decision
of
the
state's
highest
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--saying
that
the
state
lower
court
got
it
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
all
depends
on
there
having
been
a
change.
what
there
was
was
gubernatorial
appointment.
then
the
legislature
passes
a
law.
suppose
that
the
circuit
court
had
said,
sorry,
legislature,
you
got
it
wrong,
general
prevails,
you
can't
do
it
this
way,
the
law
is
invalid.
suppose
the
circuit
court
had
said
that.
then
there
would
not
have
been
an
election,
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there
becomes...
there
becomes
a
change
only
because
the
circuit
court
has
made
the
mistake
about
what
the
state
law
is.
that's
very
odd.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
requires
covered
states
to
obtain
federal
preclearance
before
making
any
change
in
their
voting
practices.
this
case
presents
a
novel
question
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
word
"change"
in
the
context
of
section
5.
the
voting
practice
at
issue
is
the
method
used
to
film
midterm
vacancies
on
the
commission
governing
mobile,
alabama.
in
1985,
alabama
passed
and
obtained
preclearance
of
an
act
substituting
special
elections
for
the
earlier
installed
practice
of
gubernatorial
appointment.
when
the
next
midterm
vacancy
occurred
in
1987,
the
governor,
in
keeping
with
the
1985
act
pulled
a
special
election.
but
before
the
election
took
place,
a
voter
challenged
the
1985
act
in
state
court.
the
challenger
urged
that
the
act
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
set
out
in
alabama's
constitution
for
enacting
laws,
not
of
statewide
governments
but
applicable
to
one
county
only.
the
trial
court
rejected
the
challenge
and
allowed
the
election
to
go
forward.
the
year
after
the
winner
took
office,
however,
the
alabama
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
court's
decision.
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
the
1985
law
authorizing
special
elections
indeed
did
violate
the
state
constitutions'
instruction
on
the
passage
of
local
laws.
accordingly,
when
the
next
midterm
vacancy
occurred
in
2005,
governor
bob
riley
in
line
with
the
alabama
supreme
court's
decision,
sought
to
fill
the
opening
by
appointment.
a
group
of
plaintiffs
led
by
appellee,
yvonne
kennedy,
then
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
the
practice
of
gubernatorial
appointment
to
kennedy
led
plaintiffs
maintained,
was
a
change
from
the
special
election
held
under
the
1985
law.
therefore,
they
argued
section
5
barring
alabama
from
filling
the
vacancy
by
appointment
rather
than
election
unless
the
state
first
obtained
preclearance.
adopting
the
view
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs,
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
district
court
granted
them
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
governor
riley
appealed
that
decision
to
this
court.
we
first
project
the
kennedy's
plaintiffs
now
appellee's
contention
that
the
governor's
appeal
was
untimely.
on
the
merits,
we
reversed
the
district
court
and
hold
that
for
section
5
purposes,
the
invalidated
1985
law
never
gained
force
or
effect.
therefore,
the
states
reversing
to
its
prior
practice
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
rank
as
a
change
requiring
preclearance.
our
decision
today
rests
on
an
extraordinary
circumstance,
not
present
in
any
past
case
interpreting
the
section
5
term
in
force
or
effect.
the
1985
law
was
challenged
at
earliest
opportunity,
the
lone
election
was
held
in
the
shadow
of
that
legal
challenge
and
the
law
was
ultimately
invalidated
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
that
court's
prerogative
to
say
what
alabama
law
is,
merits
respect
in
federal
forms,
much
as
this
court's
decisions
on
question
to
federal
law
command
respect
in
state
forums.
a
state
law
invalidated
by
a
state
supreme
court
under
the
circumstances
presented
here
is
properly
regarded
as
void
from
the
start
and
therefore
incapable
of
establishing
a
voting
practice
for
section
5
purposes.
a
contrary
holding
in
this
case,
we
note,
would
have
the
anomalous
effect
of
binding
the
state
to
a
practice
improperly
enacted
under
the
state's
constitution,
and
we
do
so
simply
because
the
state
trial
court
misread
alabama
law
and
therefore,
erroneously
allowed
the
1987's
special
election
to
proceed.
for
these
reasons
and
others
detailed
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
section
5
did
not
require
alabama
to
obtain
preclearance
before
reinstating
the
practice
of
gubernatorial
appointment.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
district
court's
judgment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
joins.
