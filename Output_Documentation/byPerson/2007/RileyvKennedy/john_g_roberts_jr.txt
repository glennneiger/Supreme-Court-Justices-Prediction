chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
riley,
governor
of
alabama,
versus
kennedy.
mr.
newsom.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
pretty
hard
to
argue
something
wasn't
in
force
and
effect
when
they
have
an
election
under
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
circuit
court
had
gotten
the
state
law
right,
then
there
never
would
have
been
an
election?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
counsel,
since
you
mentioned
section
5,
perhaps
you
ought
to
look
at
it.
it
says
that
you
have
to
preclear
standards,
practices,
whatever,
different
from
that
in
force
or
effect
on
november
1st,
1964.
now,
the
respondents
in
their
brief
accused
you
of
making
the
argument
that
since
this
isn't
different
from
what
was
in
effect
in
1964
you
don't
have
to
preclear
it.
and
you
said,
no,
that's
not
what
we're
saying;
we
take
no
position
on
that.
why
in
the
world
did
you
say
that?
it
says
quite
clearly
the
standard
has
to
be
different
from
that
in
force
or
effect
on
november
1st,
'64.
at
that
point
these
people
were
appointed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
your
reply
brief
on
page
8
you
say
you
take
no
position
on
that
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
wouldn't
be
a
different
baseline
for
judicial
changes
than
there
would
be
for
legislative
or
executive
changes,
would
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
newsom.
ms.
karlan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
did
alabama
have
to
preclear
anything?
on
november
1st,
1964,
this
was
an
appointed
position.
this
is
not
a
change
from
what
was,
quote,
1st,
1964.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
no.
those
decisions
are
all
dicta.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
something
else
changed--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--whether
they
are
membership
elections
or
at
large
elections.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
argument
you
made
in
your
brief
was
that
this
was
already
decided
in
reno
versus
bossier
parish.
i
didn't
see
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
the
argument
that
this
was
not,
in
fact,
a
change
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
they
had
the
argument...
you
at
least
thought
they
did--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
quote
in
your
brief
reno
versus
bossier
parish
and
one
other
case.
i'm
thinking
of
one
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
and
you
raised
the
argument...
you
criticized
them
for
raising
this
argument;
that
this
wasn't
any
different;
but
you
did
not
say
that
it
wasn't
any
different.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
you're
quite
right
on
the
doj
regulations
and
the
house
report,
but
i
just
don't
see
how
that
squares
with
the
statutory
language.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
because
we've
ignored
the
text
in
other
areas,
we
should
just
forget
about
it
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
that...
they
ratified...
these
cases
were
ratified
by
congress,
but
congress
did
not
change
the
language
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
karlan.
mr.
shanmugan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
district
court...
circuit
court
i
guess
it
is
in
alabama.
this
action
is
filed
before
the
election
and
the
circuit
court
says:
you
may
have
a
successful
claim
here,
but
i'm
not
going
to
disrupt
the
election,
there
isn't
time;
so
this
election
can
go
forward
and
during
that
period
i'll
be
considering
the
law.
we
do
that
all
the
time,
or
three
judge
district
courts
do,
saying
we're
going
to
look
at
this
question,
but
we
don't
have
time
to
stop
the
election
so
it's
going
to
go
forward.
in
that
case,
would
that
lead
to
the
same
result?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
sure,
but
not
always.
you
know,
if
it's
a
week
before
the
election
or
something,
even
if
they
think
it's
a
serious
claim,
they
sometimes
say:
we're
going
to
allow
the
election
to
go
forward
because
we're
going
to
look
at
this
and
perhaps
the
state
supreme
court
has
to
look
at
it,
and
we
don't
want
to
hold
up
the
election.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
talk
about
force
and
effect.
of
course,
the
statute
says
"force
or
effect
on
november
1st,
1964.
"
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
ms.
karlan's
response
on
my
quaint
fixation
on
the
language
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
can't
tie
our
hands
in
properly
interpreting
the
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how...
regardless
of
how
consistent
the
interpretation
is,
how
can
you
read
1st,
1964>
["],
to
mean
anything
other
than
that
date?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
newsom,
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
ms.
karlan's
response
that
this
is
not
the
same
practice
but
it's
different
because
the
underlying
method
of
election
has
been
changed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
