ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
turn
initially
to
two
cases
that
weren't
mentioned
yet
by
the
court
that
i
think
dispose
of
the
question
of
whether
the
law
was
in
force
or
effect.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
101
of
the
joint
appendix,
because
the
language
i'm
going
to
be
talking
about
appears
there
in
the
course
of
the
governor's
request
for
reconsideration
of
doj's
objection.
this
is
the
language
from
this
court's
opinion
in
young
against
fordice.
and
it
starts
midway
down
the
page,
where
the
court
says
that:
"the
simple
fact
that
a
voting
practice
is
unlawful
under
state
law
does
not
show
entirely
by
itself
that
the
practice
was
never
in
force
or
effect.
"
we
agree.
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say:
"a
state,
after
all,
might
maintain
in
effect
for
many
years
a
plan
that
technically
or
in
one
respect
or
another
violated
some
provision
of
state
law.
"
citing
perkins
against
matthews
and
city
of
lockhart
against
united
states.
all
that
young
against
fordice
does
is
explain
that
that
case
is
a
sport
that
deviates
from
the
general
rule
that
this
court
has
had
that
when
a
law
is
in
force
or
effect
its
constitutionality
under
state
law
doesn't
matter.
i'd
also
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
114
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
act
85-237's
text
appears,
and
direct
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
section
4,
which
says:
"this
act
shall
become
effective
immediately
upon
its
passage
and
approval
by
the
governor
upon
its
otherwise
becoming
a
law.
"
which
it
did
in
june
of
'85
when
the
state
obtained
preclearance.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
honestly
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia,
because
alabama
law
has
different
views,
for
example,
on
ripeness
and
the
like
than
article
iii
does.
and
this
also
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
ginsburg
asked
at
the
very
end
of
the
argument
about
the
remedy
in
this
case,
because
alabama
law
here
is
quite
peculiar.
and
since
we
filed
our
brief
there
have
been
two
opinions
by
the
alabama
supreme
court,
in
a
case
called
roper
against
rhodes
and
a
case
called
wood
against
booth,
that
reiterated
under
alabama
law
once
an
election
has
been
held,
if
no
contest
litigation
was
timely
brought,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
unentitled
to
remain
in
office
does
not
allow
contest
after
the
fact.
so
we
have
a
peculiar
problem
in
this
case,
which
is,
even
if
this
court
were
to
reverse,
there
was
an
election
held
here
pursuant
to
alabama
act
2006-342
that
was
conceivably
valid
under
alabama
law.
and
the
question
whether
to
replace
merceria
ludgood
who
won
that
election,
as
you
noted,
by
a
four
to
one
margin,
with
either
juan
chastang
or
somebody
else
is
quite
up
in
the
air.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
in
this
case,
the
election
hadn't
been
held
yet,
justice
scalia.
that
is,
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
the
riley
decision
here
ruled
in
the
governor's
favor
before
we
brought
our
preclearance
action,
so
there
was
no
election
on
the
table.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
your
honor.
we're
not
saying
that
alabama
is
locked
in
by
the
mistake
of
the
circuit
court.
what
we're
claiming
here
is
that
in
april
of
1985,
alabama
passed
act
85-237.
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
it
went
into
effect.
in
1985,
alabama
received
preclearance.
that
law
was
on
the
books;
an
election
was
held;
a
man
served
for
three
years.
but
it's
not
just
that,
justice
ginsburg.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
your
honor--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
no,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
page
5
of
the
defendant's
trial
brief,
which
is...
i
think
it's
docket
no.
16...
you'll
see
that
there
in
footnote
5
the
state
says:
we
asked
for
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
hold
act
85-237
void
ab
initio.
they
did
not
do
that,
but
we
think
they
ought
to
have.
and
so
even
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
i
don't
think
this
is
100
percent
clear.
but
if
i
can
turn
to
the
2004
act,
because
we
think--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--my
answer
to
his
question
is
perkins
against
matthews
and
city
of
lockhart
against
united
states
still
compel
the
result
of
finding
that
this
law
went
into
effect
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
because
the
question
of
whether
a
law
is
in
force
or
effect
is
a
question
of
construing
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
which
is
federal
law.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
i
am.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
it
does
not
render
it
constitutional.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it
locks
it
in
until
the
state
comes
up
with
a
constitutional
cure,
in
the
same
way--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
it
cannot
go
back.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
require
that
they
stay
with
that
law.
it
simply
says
they
cannot
make
a
change
without
obtaining
preclearance,
because
that's
what
section
5
does.
it's
a
clear,
bright
line
rule.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
it's
a
little
trickier
than
that,
justice
souter,
for
the
following
reason.
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
will--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
what
i
was
about
to
explain.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
we
are,
but
as
i
suggested,
it's
a
little
trickier
than
that.
because,
of
course,
the
existing
practice
is
for
purposes
of
section
5
the
law
that's
in
force
or
effect.
so,
for
example,
suppose
you
had
a
state
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--excuse
me?
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
candidly,
is
yes,
and
the
state
can
cure
that
quite
quickly.
but
let
me
explain
it
with
a
hypothetical
that
might
make
this
clearer,
which
is:
suppose
you
had
a
state
in
which
people
were
voting
in
an
election,
and
then
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
that
part
of
the
county
had
never
been
properly
annexed.
the
state
would
be
required
to
continue
letting
those
people
vote
in
the
election
unless
and
until
it
received
preclearance
from
the
department
of
justice.
that's
what
perkins
against
matthews
and
city
of
lockhart
require.
so
the
state
has
to,
once
it
adopts
a
practice,
continue
using
that
practice
unless
and
until
it
receives
preclearance
for
a
new
practice
or...
and
this
is
somewhat--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
in
your
hypothetical
there
would
be
no
problem
at
all,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
souter's
hypothetical
that
he
asked
mr.
newsom,
which
is:
that
law
hasn't
been
precleared.
therefore,
it's
never
in
force
or
effect
as
a
baseline.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
then
it
would
be
perkins
against
matthews.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
there
are
two
factual
points
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is,
with
respect
to
perkins
against
matthews,
the
mississippi
statute
that
required
the
use
of
at
large
rather
than
district
elections
was
passed
in
1962
and
used
precisely
once
before
the
preclearance,
so
it
was
on
all
fours
with
this
case.
it
was
a
three
year
lag
between
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
city
of
canton's
practice
and
the
preclearance.
so
if
we
were
to
ask
what
does
our
case
look
most
like
that
this
court
has
already
decided,
it
would
be
perkins.
the
second
point
which
i
want
to
direct
the
court
to
is
we
are
not
actually
talking
in
this
case...
and
this
goes
as
well
to
the
court's
judicial
function...
about
just
act
85-237.
we
are
also
talking
in
this
case
about
act
2004-215,
which
was
the
attempt
by
the
alabama
legislature
to
revise
the
constitutionality
of
act
85-237.
because
the
central
problem
in
this
case
was
a
provision
of
the
alabama
constitution,
section
105,
that
said
you
couldn't
pass
local
legislation
unless
the
act...
unless
the
general
act
made
that
very
clear.
so
in
2004
the
alabama
legislature
thought
it
had
solved
the
entire
problem
here
by
amending
the
section
of
chapter
11
of
the
alabama
election
law
to
say
unless
a
local
law
provides
otherwise
you
can
use
gubernatorial
appointment.
that
law
was
intended
to
revive
act
85-237.
we
know
this
because,
among
other
things,
our
clients
were
the
sponsors
of
the
act,
among
the
sponsors
of
the
act.
now,
the
alabama
legislature--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--yes,
but
if
i
can
explain
why
i
think
this
is
important
in
a
sense.
it's
because
the
claim
of
the
state
is
that
this
is
a
case
about
fundamental
constitutional
provisions
of
alabama
law,
but
in
fact
in
its
current
guise,
which
is
whether
the
2004
act
revived
the
1985
act,
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
what
the
alabama
supreme
court
said
is:
we
don't
think
the
legislature
meant
to
make
this
law
retroactive;
we
think
they
meant
to
make
it
only
prospective.
but
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
talking
about
fundamental
marbury
against
madison
judicial
review
of
the
kind
that
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
which
leads
to
the
second
pair
of
cases
that
we
think
this
court
has
already
decided
that
provide
you
absolutely
clear
guidance
as
to
why
preclearance
was
required
here.
and
that's
this
court's
decision
in
hathorn
against
lovorn
and
this
court's
decision
in
branch
against
smith.
in
both
of
those
cases
as
well,
you
had
the
question,
quite
acutely
in
hathorn
against
lovorn,
of
whether
or
not
the
chancery
court
in
mississippi,
which
is
a
trial
level
court,
got
the
law
right
or
wrong
on
whether
elections
should
be
conducted
in
a
particular
way
in
warren
county.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
they
got
it
wrong.
but
this
court
said
that
decision
and
the
implementation
require
preclearance
because
the
presence
of
a
court
decree
doesn't
exempt
a
contested
change
from
section
5.
so
in
this
case,
had
governor
riley
decided
completely
by
himself
that
he,
having
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
alabama
constitution,
could
not
in
good
conscience
let
a
special
election
go
forward
here,
it
would
be
no
different
from
having
the
alabama
supreme
court
decide
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
they
have
to--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no.
no,
justice
scalia.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
they
do
not
have
to
come
before
this
court
at
all.
the
chief
election
administrators
of
alabama
or,
in
this
case,
the
governor
must
come
before
the
court
before
he
issues
a
certificate
of
office.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
he
doesn't
even
have
to
come
before
the
attorney
general.
if
you
look
at
the
statutes,
he
could
have
come
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
gotten
a--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
the
attorney
general
found
that
this
was
a
retrogressive
change.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
exactly
what
was
submitted
after
the
federal
court
did,
which
is
the...
the
decision
to
appoint
rather
than
to
elect
someone
to
district
1
of
the
mobile
county
commission.
the
alabama
supreme
court
didn't
have
to
submit
anything,
and
the
federal
court
could
not
have
been
clearer
in
this
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
it
told--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor.
that's
not
what
they
said.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
if
you
turn
to
the
august
18th
final
judgment,
which
is
on
page
9a
over
to
page
10a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
they
said
judgment
is
entered
in
our
favor...
that
was
the
declaratory
judgment...
and
then
said
the
state
of
alabama
has
days
to
obtain
preclearance.
the
state
was
free
to
come
to
the
ddc
and
seek
judicial
preclearance
if
they
wanted.
the
state
was
free,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
to
try
and
use
the
quick
way.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
but
it...
it--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--justice
ginsburg,
this
does
not
say
the
state
has
to
preclear
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
it
simply
says...
and
if
you
look
at
page
8a,
which
is
the
end
of
the
district
court's
opinion...
you
know,
it's
enjoining
enforcement
of
those
decisions;
it's
not
enjoining
those
decisions.
you
don't
have
to
spin
the
alabama
supreme
court
here.
but
they
literally
sued
only
the
governor
in
this
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
for
one
thing,
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
its
decisions--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--but
let
me
go
then
straight
to
a
factual
point,
which
is
this
is
not
the
same
practice
as
they
were
using
on
november
1st
of
1964,
because
that
practice
was
a
combination
of
two
things.
it
was
gubernatorial
appointment
under
alabama
section
11-3-6,
and
it
was
gubernatorial
appointment
in
the
context
of
at
large
elections,
but--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's
a
huge
difference,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
we
didn't--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--we
didn't
see
that
until
their
reply
brief,
and
we
didn't
think
we
needed
to
file
a
surreply
brief.
this
court
doesn't
allow
them.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
think
you're
probably
thinking
about
young
against
fordice,
itself.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
their
claim
there
was
that...
not
that
this
wasn't
any
different,
but
part
of
our
explanation
is
that,
in
context,
we
think
there
is
a
difference
between
what
was
going
on
in
1964.
they
actually,
i
think,
want
to
go
back
to
the
1977
to
1985
practice,
which
is
the
post...
the
post
election
practice
in
alabama
once
brown
against
moore
had
been
decided.
now,
the
other
thing
is
i
will
say
that
the
department
of
justice
regulations
on
this,
which
are
quite
clear,
have
been
in
effect
since
1987.
and
in
the
2006...
in
the
2006
re
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act,
if
you
look
at
the
house
report,
they
talk
about
young
against
fordice
there.
and
they
say
"mississippi's
attempt
to
revive
and
to
resuscitate.
"
--and
those
are
the
house's
words,
"to
revive
or
resuscitate"...
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
could
just
make
an
observation
about
section
5
more
generally
in
allen,
and
i'll
start
here.
in
allen,
itself,
this
court
recognized
that
the
text
of
section
5
doesn't
provide
for
private
rights
of
action,
and
yet
it
found
them.
it
recognized
that
the
text
of
section
14
of
the
voting
rights
act
suggests
that
the
only
place
that
can
be...
that
the
only
place
that
can
litigate
section
5--

--no,
because
that's...
that's
the...
those
sets
of
decisions
by
this
court
have
been
ratified
by
congress
and
have
been
the
longstanding
practice
under
section
5.
you
should
continue
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
because
it
thought
that
the
purpose
of
section
5...
if
i
could
spend
just
one
sentence
on
this...
the
purpose
of
section
5's
november
1st
language
was
to
prevent
a
sort
of
game
of
whac-a-mole
in
which
the
states
would
keep
changing
the
practice.
and
the
idea
of
that
freeze
was
to
hold
it
in
place
so
that
it
could
be
challenged
as
a
constitutional
matter
before
the
state
switched
again.
it
wasn't
to
create
a
safe
harbor
against
attacks
on
the
november
1st
practice.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
