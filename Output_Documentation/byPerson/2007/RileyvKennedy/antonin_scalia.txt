are
there
any
other
district
cases
that
require
preclearance
except
those
that
redistrict
the,
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
law
to
be
cleared
if
you...
if
you
assume
that
the
existence
of
a
law
to
be
cleared
occurs
before
that
law
has
been
tested
in
the
courts.
in
the
hypothetical
we've
been
discussing,
just
as
in
this
case,
there
was
a
state
law
and
if
you
assume
the
state
law
is
valid
before
it's
gone
through
the
judicial
clearance
process,
there
is
a
state
law
change
when
the
clearance
process
results
in
striking
down
the
law.
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
two
situations
are
pretty
parallel.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
other
hand,
i
can
also
see
the
attorney
general
saying:
why
should
i
preclear
it?
it
hasn't
even
been
determined
to
be
law
in
alabama
yet.
does
the
justice
department
preclear
stuff
that
is...
that
is
in
the
midst
of
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
they
are
doing
the
districting
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
of
any
cases
where...
where
a
piece
of
state
legislation
has
been
in
the
middle
of
litigation
where
the
justice
department
has
precleared
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
like
an
exercise
in
futility.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
able
to
be
brought
up
here
if
it
was
based
on
a
discriminatory
intent,
certainly.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
the
lawsuit
to
invalidate
it
was
filed
as
soon
as
was
feasible?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
the
alabama
supreme
court
say
that
in
this
very
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
i
follow
you
that,
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law,
it
went
into
effect.
just
because
the
statute
said
it
went
into
effect
does
not
prove
that
it
went
into
effect.
i
think
the
alabama--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
alabama
supreme
court
would
say
it
never
went
into
effect
because
it
was
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
rule
of
law
renders
constitutional
under
state
law
an
act
that
would
otherwise
not
be
constitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that's
the
effect:
it
locks
it
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
it
can't
go
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
reason
that,
absent
their
coming
up
with
a
new
law,
what
law
would
be
in
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
alabama
supreme
court
preclear?
where
it
was
redistricting
and
it
had
a
redistricting
plan,
i
can
see
it
would
send
over
to
the
attorney
general
the
new
redistricting
plan.
what...
what
do
the
justices
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
have
to
come
before
the
attorney
general
to
get
his
benediction
upon?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
submit
their
opinion
and
say,
"mr.
attorney
general,
please
approve
our
opinion?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
the
attorney
general,
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
first
of
all,
you're
trying
to
get...
the
quick
way
is
to
get
it
from
the
attorney
general.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
what
was
supposed...
what
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
attorney
general?
what
is
the
alabama
supreme
court's--
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
problem
with
the
republican
form
of
government
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
what's
going
on
here,
the...
the
legislative
process
of
the
people
of
alabama,
whereby
something
is
invalid
as
a
law,
suddenly
becomes
a
law
because
the
federal
attorney
general
has
given
it
preclearance.
the
people
have
never
voted
for
that
properly
under
their
constitution.
yet,
it
becomes
law
in
alabama.
and
that's
a
republican
form
of
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
an
alabama
law
that
had
never
been
adopted
by
the
people
of
alabama?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
validated,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
shanmugan,
what
does
the
attorney
general
do
when
he
gets...
i
mean,
does
he
just
preclear
any
old
thing
that
somebody
shoves
under
his
nose?
does
he
look
to
see
whether
there
is
litigation
pending
on
it?
was
this
litigation
pending
when
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
plan
was
submitted--
