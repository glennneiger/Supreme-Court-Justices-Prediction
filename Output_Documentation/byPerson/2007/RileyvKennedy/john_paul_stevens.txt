what
if
there
had
been
no
challenge
to
that
election,
but
two
or
three
years
later
somebody
challenged
the
election
and
then
the
supreme
court
said
it
was
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
there
never
would
have
been
a
state
statute.

mr.
newsom,
i
hate
to
intrude
on
your
rebuttal
time,
but
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
a
state
after
1964
and
before
2000
made
35
different
changes
of
all
improved
voting
rights,
could
they
always
go
back
to
the
practice
in
effect
of
1964
and
not
have
to
preclear?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
be
any
kind
of
change,
legislative,
administrative,
judicial,
could
they
always
go
back
to
1964
and
have
a
safe
harbor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
how
much
teeth
there
is
in
the
1964
date.
is
it
safe
harbor
or
isn't
it?
