justice
david
h.
souter
are
there
district
court...
there
must
be...
district
court
cases
in
which
the
state
trial
court
has
invalidated
on
some
state
constitutional
ground
legislation
redistricting
that
has
been
passed
by
the
legislature?
when
that
happens,
have
those
opinions
been
precleared?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
reason
that
there
would
be
no
reason
to
preclear
them?
i
mean,
if
the
state
court
invalidates
legislative
redistricting,
and
does
so
before
there
has
been
a
preclearance
request,
in
other
words,
if
it
gets
into
state
court
right
off
the
bat,
then
there's
no
state
law
subsequently
to
ask
the
feds
to
preclear.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
your
"no"
answer
does
not
prove
much.
in
other
words,
you're
trying
to
make
the
case
here
that
there
is
something
extremely
unusual
about
this.
and
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
in
effect
was
one
reason
that
it's
unusual
is
that
we
don't
have
any
of
these
cases
in,
in
which
a
state
court
has
knocked
out
a
state
law
that
is
then
subject
to
some
kind
of
preclearance
review.
and
my
only
point
was,
if
i
understand
the
situation,
as
long
as
the
preclearance
review
had
not
preceded
the
state
constitutionality
judgment,
following
the
state
constitutionality
judgment
there
would
be
no
law
to
take
to
washington,
whether
it
be
to...
to
the
justice
department
or
to...
or
to
the
court,
and
ask
to
have
precleared.
so
the
fact
that
there
are
no
such
cases
doesn't
prove
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
never
would
have
been
perhaps
preclearance
if
it
got
it
right
soon
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
if
the...
if
the
challenging
parties
go
into
court
at
the
first
opportunity
and
you
don't
have
an
election
sort
of
coming
up
next
week,
i
would
suppose
that
in
cases
like
that,
the
state
would
at
least
allow
the
state
litigation
to
proceed
to
some
level.
and
if
in
point
of
fact
that
state
litigation
resulted
in
a
declaration
that
the
new
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
some
fashion,
one
would
not
expect
the
state
then
to
bull
ahead
and
ask
for
preclearance,
as
opposed
to
trying
either
to
appeal
at
the
state
level
or
to
correct
the
statute.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
will
assume
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
locks
it
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask:
you're
not...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
didn't
think
you
were
arguing
that
because
of
the
preclearance
followed
by
the
state
determination
of
unconstitutionality,
that
the
state
was
required
to
follow
that
unconstitution
law.
i
thought
your
argument
simply
was
that,
in
effect,
there
was
a
stalemate
at
that
point,
and
the
state
was
going
to
have
to
come
up
with
some
new
law
that
would
be
precleared.
am
i
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
the
answer
that
no
law
would
be
in
effect?
i
mean,
you're
in
the
same
situation
then
that
you
would
be
in
if
there
had
been
no
judicial
litigation
going
on,
the
law
had
been
brought
to
the
justice
department
or
the
d.c.
court,
had...
preclearance
had
been
refused.
the
state
at
that
point
didn't
have
the
old
law
because
it
had
been
repealed.
it
couldn't
apply
the
new
law
because
it
wasn't
precleared,
and
somebody
in
alabama
would
have
to
do
something.
aren't
we
in
essentially
the
same
position
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
was
in
force
and
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
theory
require
that
we
assume
it
remains
in
force
and
effect
by
virtue
of
the
preclearance
even
when
there
is
a
subsequent
determination
of
unconstitutionality?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
as
a
matter
of
federalism
is
it
more
extraordinary
to
review
a
court
determination
than
the
determination
of
a
popularly
elected
legislature?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
are
not
saying
state
law
is
different
from
what
it
means.
they
are
saying
that
you
cannot
put
a
change
in
effect
until
you
get
it
precleared.
