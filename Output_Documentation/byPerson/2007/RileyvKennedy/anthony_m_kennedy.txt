justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
respondent
prevails
in
this
case
and
you
have
a
case
similar
to
this
one
that
begins
in
the
trial
court,
how
do
you
think
it
would
work,
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court
action
have
to
get
preclearance
either
way?
they
have
to
get
preclearance
in
the
event
that
they
prevail?
and
then
the
other
side
has
to
get
preclearance
in
the
event
that
it
doesn't.
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
it
would
work
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i'm
in
state
trial
court,
how
can
i
make
a
ruling
if...
assuming
the
respondents
win
in
this
case,
if
i
know
there
has
to
be
preclearance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
states
get...
state
courts
get
preclearance
all
the
time
with
district
changes,
don't
they?
or
how
does
it
work?
they
just
hold
the
judgment
in
abeyance
until
there
is
preclearance,
and
couldn't...
and
if
so,
couldn't
do
you
that
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
said
in
answer
to
justice
souter
that
this
is
your
case.
there
is
no
law
that's
precleared.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
in
the
hypothetical
justice
souter
proposes,
i
don't
know
the
rules
in
alabama,
but
i
can
see
a
federal
court
saying:
well,
this
is
premature;
it
hasn't
been
precleared;
why
should
i
pass
on
the
validity
of
something
that
might
not
be
precleared?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
apply
to
a
state
statute
which
is
fully
enacted
and
then
there's
going
to
be
a
challenge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
it's
your
position...
and
i
noticed
this
in
the
question
put
to
you
by
justice
breyer...
tell
me
if
this
is
wrong,
but
that
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
the
court
makes
a
decision,
because
the
court
may
have
discretion
to
choose
plan
one,
plan
two,
plan
three,
but
it
is
if
the
court
makes
a
decision
to
show
that
the
prior
practice
was
invalid,
was
void
under
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
distinction,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
the
fact
that
it's
just
the
court,
but
the
kind
of
decision
the
court
makes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose
they
didn't
have
that
footnote.
suppose
they
said:
we
hold
it
void
ab
initio.
then,
what's
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
that
in
those
cases
you
had
what
you
had
here,
which
was
a
declaration,
let's
assume,
of
invalidity
ab
initio.
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
a
county
council
goes
to
the
board
of
commissioners
or
the
board
of
supervisors
of
the
local
county
or
legislative
branch
and
says:
the
legislature
has
just
adjourned;
it
passed
a
lot
of
laws,
and
one
of
the
laws
it
passed
is
that
that
you
now
have
to
set
the
qualifications
locally
for
certain
officials,
so
we
have
to
act
on
this
right
away.
they
pass
the
legislation.
three
weeks
go
by.
the
county
council
says:
you
know,
i
made
a
mistake;
that
law
was
never
passed;
it
was
never
signed
by
the
governor.
what
rule?
what
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
had
been
precleared?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
just
an
implication.
that's
your
whole
theory.
