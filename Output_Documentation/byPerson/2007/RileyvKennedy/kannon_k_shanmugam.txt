mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
requires
a
cover
jurisdiction
to
seek
preclearance
whenever
it
seeks
to
administer
any
change
in
its
voting
practices.
and
there
is
no
basis
in
either
text
or
policy
for
carving
out
an
exception
for
all
or
some
changes
precipitated
by
state-court
decisions.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should,
therefore,
be
affirmed.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
absolutely
not.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
don't
think,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
that
that's
actually
happened
here.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
the
practice
of
special
elections
actually
went
into
effect
while
the
litigation
was
ongoing.
the
alabama
supreme
court
then
held
that
the
statute
adopting
that
practice
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
to
be
sure,
and,
therefore,
was
void
ab
initio
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
the
remedy
in
some
sense
was
to
revert
to
the
practice
of
gubernatorial
appointments.
and
what
happened
then
was
that
it
was
then
incumbent
on
the
attorney
general
under
section
5,
the
alabama
attorney
general,
to
seek
preclearance
of
that
practice.
and
the
federal
attorney
general
made
the
determination
that
it
would
be
retrogressive
to
go
back
to
that
practice.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
had
been
adopted
by
the
people
of
alabama.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
it
was
invalid,
to
be
sure,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
then...
and
then
what
happens
at
that
point
is
that
the
alabama
attorney
general
is
in
very
much
the
same
position
as
he
would
be
if
the
federal
attorney
general
had
held
that
some
statutory
provision
that
had
been
enacted
by
the
alabama
legislature
was
improperly
retrogressive.
he
would
be
faced
with
a
choice:
he
could
either
proceed
under
a
practice
that
was
invalid
under
state
law,
or
the
state
could
pass
a
new
law
providing
a--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that's
exactly
right,
and
under
our
view
there
would
not
have
been
a
change,
because
it
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
special
election
that
was
critical.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
there
becomes
a
change,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
practice
of
special
elections
actually
went
into
effect
by
virtue,
at
a
minimum
of
the
fact
that
an
election
was
held.
and
to
be
sure--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
what
a
state
court
might
do
in
that
circumstance
would
be
to
enter
a
stay
until
it
could
adjudicate
the
validity--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it
is
certainly
the
implication
of
our
position
that
if
the
law
actually
goes
into
effect
and
an
election
is
held
and
if
preclearance
has
already
been
granted
for,
in
some
sense,
the
contrary
position,
then,
yes,
if
the
state
supreme
court
or
the
state
trial
court
subsequently
gives
state
law
a
different
interpretation,
then
that
change
is
going
to
require
preclearance.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
it
is
our
theory
as
to
what
the
"in
force
or
effect"
requirement
means.
and
we
believe
that
that
follows
from
this
court's
decision
in
young
versus
fordice,
which
sets
out
the
parameters
for
determining--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
breyer,
the
harm
is
that
there
would
be
actual
retrogression.
and
i
think
that
there
are
two
critical
and
distinct
legal
issues
that
this
court
needs
to
address.
the
first
is
whether
this
practice
was
in
effect
for
long
enough
for
it
to
have
been
in
force
or
effect.
the
governing
precedent
on
that
issue
is
young
versus
fordice.
and
we
believe
that
there
is
more
here.
there
is
not
simply
the
partial
implementation
of
voter
registration
procedures
for
a
very
brief
period
of
time,
a
matter
of
weeks.
an
election
was
actually
held
and
if
that
is
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
"in
force
or
effect"
requirement,
it's
hard
to
see
what
would
be.
the
second
question
is
whether
a
practice
can
be
said
to
be
in
force
or
effect
when
it
was
void
ab
initio
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
we
do
respectfully
submit
that
the
city
of
lockhart
and
perkins
answer
that
question
because
in
both
of
those
case
the
court
held
that
the
relevant
question
was
whether
the
practice
was
actually
in
effect.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
it
isn't
quaint
at
all.
i
would
say
that
i
do
think
that
as
a
textual
matter
one
could
perhaps
make
the
argument
that
where
a
covered
jurisdiction
changes
its
voting
practice
after
the
statutory
coverage
date
and
then
enacts
basically
a
new
version
of
the
pre
existing
practice,
that
the
new
practice
could
as
a
formal
matter
be
said
to
be
a
new
practice.
but
i
want
to
make
two
additional
points.
the
first
is
that
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
covers
reversion
to
coverage
date
practices
is
really
not
properly
before
the
court.
appellant
seemingly
did
not
raise
it
before
the
district
court
and
it
is
not--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
it's
not
within
the
scope
of
the
question
presented,
either.
the
question
presented
focuses
solely
on
the
question
of
whether
changes
precipitated
by
state
court
decisions
require
preclearance.
and
that's
a
question
that
this
court
has
answered
twice
in
hathorn
and
branch.
the
only
other
thing
that
i
would
say
is
that
it
has
been
not
only
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
attorney
general,
but
also
the
consistent
interpretation
as
far
as
we
are
aware
of
the
lower
court,
that
the
statute
does
reach
reversions
to
preexisting
practices
as
well.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
do
think
that
a
textual
argument
could
be
made,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
practice
that
was
in
effect
as
of
the
coverage
date
in
some
sense
ceases
to
exist
when
the
jurisdiction
adopts
an
intervening
distinct
practice.
and
certainly
there
is
enough
ambiguity,
i
believe,
to
get
us
into
the
realm
of
deference,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
attorney
general's
interpretations
of
section
5
are
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
this
bears--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--this
bears
on
a
critical
point,
justice
scalia.
and
this
court
has
a
line
of
cases
in
the
section
5
area
that
says
that
it
is
really
incumbent
on
covered
jurisdictions
when
they
seek
preclearance
clearly
to
identify
the
relevant
change
in
their
voting
practices
when
they
come
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance.
and
when
the
1985
act
was
submitted
for
preclearance,
there
was
nary
a
word
in
the
alabama
attorney
general's
submission
that
there
was
any
potential
difficulty
with
the
statute
under
state
law.
and
so,
the
attorney
general
precluded
on
the
understandable
understanding
that
the
statute
simply
affected
a
shift
to
special
elections.
and
i
do
think
that
the
great
price
of
appellant's
interpretation
is
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
it,
it
would
suddenly
shift
the
burden
to
the
federal
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
district
court
to
when
they
receive
a
preclearance
submission,
essentially
assess
the
meaning
and
validity
of
any
state
statute,
lest
the
state
statute
be
construed
differently
by
a
state
court,
and
thus,
lock
in
the
preclearance
court
or
attorney
general.
and
we
believe
that
that
problem
along
with
this
court's
decision
in
branch
and
hawthorne
support
our
interpretation.
thank
you.
