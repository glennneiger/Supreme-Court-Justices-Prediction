justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
there
were
instances
in
which
state
supreme
courts
participated
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
changes
in
election
requirements
for
the
purposes
of
disenfranchising
african-americans.
are
they
wrong
on
that?
and
if
they're
right
on
that,
what
reason
is
there
to
think
that,
without
any
text
in
section
5
to
making
an
exception
for
changes
that
are
made
by
state
courts,
what
would
be
the
reason
for
reading
that
in?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you're
saying
that
if
a
state
passes
a
statute...
a
state
legislature
passes
a
statute
that's
flagrantly
in
violation
of
the
state
constitution,
it
immediately
is
precleared,
it's
locked
into
place?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
could
just
ask
you,
in
making
that
argument,
aren't
you
asking
us
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
this
act...
that
the
intent
of
the
alabama
legislature
in
passing
that
act
is
different
from
the
intent
as
determined
by
the
alabama
supreme
court?
