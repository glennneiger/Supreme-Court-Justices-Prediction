justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
happened...
i
have
a
factual
question.
in
around
july,
mr.
sam
jones
is
sworn
in
and
now
he
is
in
office
until
sometime
after,
i
guess,
september
1988,
a
little
over
a
year,
and
then
the
governor
appointed
him.
well,
he
must
have
gotten
paid
during
that
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
when
the
governor
appointed
him,
what
does
the
appointment
look
like?
does
it
say
it's
retroactive?
no.
i
would
be
surprised.
i
mean,
you're
not
going
to
tell
me
it
is.
so
my
guess
is
he's
appointed
as
of...
let's
say
he's
appointed
by
the
governor.
it
must
have
said
as
of
when,
and
it
probably
said
as
of
september
'88.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
me
because,
for
this
reason:
i
would
guess
they
don't
make
it
retroactive
or
you'd
know
it,
and
therefore
we...
we
have
more.
we
have
the
facts,
the
following
facts,
as
to
whether...
and
this
is
what
fordice
says;
it
says
this
is
a
practical
question.
it's
not
some
theory
about
whether
it's
unconstitutional
or
not
unconstitutional.
the
question
is
as
practical
matter
was
it
in
force
and
effect?
and,
as
a
practical
matter,
one,
there
was
an
election
under
it;
two,
somebody
was
elected;
three,
he
took
office;
four,
he
held
that
office
for
a
year
and
was
paid
for
it.
all
right?
why,
as
a
practical
fact,
as
a
practical
matter,
we
do
not
say
that
special
election
law
was
in
force
and
effect
for
about
a
year
and
two
months?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
their
registering
is
a
precondition
of
voting.
not
one
person
had
ever
voted.
moreover,
they
all
had
to
register
again.
so
the
net
practical
effect
of
the
election,
of
plan
two
in
young
v.
fordice,
was
null,
zero,
zilch.
and
the
practical
effect
here
is
that
somebody
is
elected
under
the
law,
holds
office
for
a
year
and
two
months,
and
is
paid.
it
seems
to
me
quite
a
big
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
i
mean,
maybe
it's
different
if
this
was
a
retroactive
something
or
other,
but
i...
you're
not
aware
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
assume
it
wasn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
i
reject
that
on
the
ground
of
what
i
said.
i'm
not
saying
i
would,
but
suppose
i
did.
isn't
that
the
end
of
this
case?
because
then,
if
i
reject
that,
there
is
a
plan.
the
plan
is
called
"the
special
election
plan".
it
is
in
effect
for
a
year
and
two
months.
people
hold
office
in
election
and
they're
paid.
and
then
a
new
plan
comes
along,
the
governor's
plan.
now
that
seems
to
me
a
change,
and
the
statute
says
that
if
you
have
a
change,
which
this
would
be,
you've
got
to
preclear
it.
end
of
matter.
now,
what's
your
argument
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
just
using
that
as
shorthand,
the
shorthand
for
a
system
under
which
the
officeholder
is
appointed
by
the
government...
by
the
governor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
saying
if
we
start
from
the
base
that
the
plan
is
special
election
which
was
in
force
and
effect
for
a
year
and
two
months,
then
for
whatever
set
of
reasons
there
is
a
change,
and
the
state
has
to
preclear
the
change.
now,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
that
if
the
cause
of
a
change
is
a
court
decision,
then
you
do
not
have
to
preclear.
so
that
if
in
mississippi
in
1975,
there
had
been
a
ruling
of
a
court
which
said
segregationist
plan
number
one
here
is
no
good,
so
we're
going
to
go
back
to
the
even
worse
plan
that
was
before,
that
that
wouldn't
have
had
to
have
been
precleared?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
where
i'm
going,
and
i'm
not
phrasing
it
correctly,
but
you
can
answer
it
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
my
question
is,
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
between
1964
and
today,
it
mattered
whether
the
cause
of
a
change
in
a
state
plan
was
a
decision
of
let's
say
five
members
of
a
court...
of
a
state
court...
or
whether
it
was
a
legislative
decision.
because
that's
what
i
think
you're
arguing,
and
is
there
any
authority
that
supports
you
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
it?
because...
i
mean,
what
they're
saying
is
let's
use
a
little
common
sense
here.
and
you
look
at
fordice
and
there
it
was
an
instance
where
it
just
didn't
take
effect
at
all
as
a
practical
matter.
and
then
we
cited
those
two
cases
you're
talking
about,
but
i
can't
tell
from
the
fordice
opinion...
there
was
a
ward
system
that
was
in
fact
in
force
or
effect.
but
i
don't
know
how
long
that
ward
system
was
in
effect.
it
might
have
been
for
a
long
time,
and
people
might
have
taken
action
under
it.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
city
of
lockhart.
i
can't
tell.
you
may
know.
but
my
point
is
they
are
saying:
here
we
have
a
middle
case,
and
what
we
want
is
to
use
enough
sense
to
say,
look,
it
wasn't
really
in
effect.
people
challenged
it
the
minute
they
could.
they...
everybody
knew
it
was
unconstitutional,
or
a
lot
of
people
believed
it.
and
the
governor
then
did
something
to
make
up
for
it.
if
you're
going
to
say
that
that
little
bit
counts
as
putting
it
in
force
and
effect,
you
know
what
we're
going
to
have?
we're
going
to
have
every
municipality
all
over
the
country
that
doesn't
always
know
what
the
rules
are,
and
they
pass
something,
and
people
challenge
it
immediately,
it's
obviously
wrong,
and
they're
stuck
with
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
that's
going
to
be
a
mess.
they're
saying
something
like
that,
so
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
young
versus
fordice,
that's
young
versus...
i
mean,
if
it
never
went
into
force
and
effect,
of
course
we
don't
reach
questions
like
republican
form
of
government
or
1964
safe
harbors
and
so
forth.
and
so
i
think
it's
an
important
matter.
and
as
i
read
fordice,
we
have
over
here
an
instance
where
nothing
happened.
you
know,
some
people
registered
and
then
immediately
they
were
told
the
registration
was
no
good.
so
it
wasn't
in
force
and
effect.
when
i
looked
at
perkins
v.
matthews,
that
was
not
a
case
where
the
law
was
challenged
immediately.
rather,
what
justice
brennan
said
is
that
this
has
been
in
effect
from
1962
to
1965
at
least,
and
in
1965
they
had
an
election
under
the
ward
system.
so
even
if
it
might
have
been
unconstitutional
or
it
was,
it
was
still
in
effect
for
three
years.
in
the
other
case,
city
of
lockhart,
justice
powell
says
this
statute
has
been
in
effect,
we
assume,
from
1917
to
1973.
that's
not
exactly
a
fleeting
matter.
so...
so
here
we
have
a
case
where
they
challenged
it
instantly,
where
it
was
litigated
as
fast
as
it
possibly
could
be,
where
in
fact,
as
justice
ginsburg
just
said,
a
different
decision
of
the
circuit
court
would
have
led
to
the
opposite
of
it
never
would
have
even
had
it.
so
what
harm
does
it
do
to
the
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
laws
of
the
united
states
if
the
holding
of
this
court
were,
well,
under
these
circumstances,
where
challenged
immediately,
et
cetera,
it
never
took
force
and
effect?
