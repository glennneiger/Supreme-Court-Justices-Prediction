mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner's
position
is
based
upon
a
fundamental
error
in
the
analysis
of
the
functional
differences
between
the
statute
of
limitations
triggered
by
article
49b,
section
9a,
and
the
routine
judicial
statute
of
limitations
which
applies
in
litigation.
if
applied
to
employment
discrimination
suits
in
maryland,
the
use
of
the
section
9a
would
lead
to
three
harmful
effects:
it
would
encourage
a
multiplicity
of
statutes
of
limitations
within
one
state
for
actions
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983;
it
would
encourage
a
multiplicity
of
federal
claims
which
might
otherwise
not
have
to
be
brought,
due
to
the
shortness
of
the
period;
and
it
would
also
encourage
individuals
to
avoid
utilizing
state
procedures
which,
particularly
after
this
court's
decision
in
patsy,
should
be
encouraged
rather
than
discouraged.
first,
as
to
the
functional
differences,
the
respondents
have
never
claimed
that
49b
is
an
inappropriate
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
merely
because
it
invokes
administrative
remedies.
the
reason
we
say
it's
an
inappropriate
period
to
apply
is
because
of
the
functional
differences
in
the
procedures
which
are
invoked.
article
49b,
like
title
vii,
is
a
multistep
enforcement
procedure
which
ultimately
culminates
in
a
formal
adjudicatory
hearing
under
section
11
of
article
49b.
however,
all
that
is
invoked
by
the
initial
filing
of
the
section
9a
complaint
is
an
administrative
investigation.
it
is
only
after
a
very
lengthy
process...
and
the
agency
has
given
itself
two
years
and
ten
months,
in
effect,
from
the
date
of
the
discriminatory
act
to
complete
that
process...
a
lengthy
process
of
investigation,
probable
cause-finding,
attempts
at
conciliation
which
is
central
to
the
statutory
scheme...
only
after
all
of
these
has
failed
may
the
commission
issue
a
formal
statement
of
charges
and
compel
the
respondent
to
answer
and
prepare
and
present
a
defense.
until
that
point,
all
that
happens
is
an
administrative
investigation.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
made
very
clear
in
the
banach
case
that
the
filing
of
the
9a
complaint
merely
triggers
that
investigative
process,
and
that
a
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
formal
notice
of
the
claim
in
the
sense
of
stating
a
claim
against
that
respondent
until
the
invocation
of
the
section
11
enforcement
proceedings
which,
as
i've
said,
can
take
two
years
and
ten
months
from
the
date
of
the
discriminatory
action,
a
period
virtually
the
same
as
the
period
we
are
urging
upon
the
court.
if
49b
were
to
be
applied
to
employment
discrimination
suits
within
the
state
of
maryland,
it
would
encourage
a
multiplicity
of
statute
of
limitations
within
one
state
for
claims
under
1983
and
1981.
1981
and
1983
apply
to
discrimination
claims
broader
than
that
of
employment
discrimination,
broader
than
that
of
49b.
therefore,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
employment
discrimination
cases
is
six
months,
it
would
be
multiplicity
of
litigation
over
the
issue
of
what
the
appropriate
statute
of
limitations
is.
while
it
is
true
that
national
uniformity
as
applied
to
1980
is
an
impossibility,
it
does
not
follow
from
that
that
internal
uniformity
should
not
be
encouraged.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
ricks,
statutes
of
limitations
should
not
commence
to
run
so
soon
that
lay
people
would
find
it
difficult
to
invoke
the
procedures.
if
there
were
a
different
statute
of
limitations
under
each
and
every
1981
or
1983
claim
which
might
be
raised,
a
lay
person
might
find
it
very
difficult
to
determine
what
category
they
fell
into
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
temanio
is
simply
irrelevant
in
this
case.
there
is
no
conflict
presented
between
a
state
law
and
a
federal
policy.
there
are
two
state
statute
of
limitations
for
this
court
to
consider.
the
court
will
inevitably
accept
one
and
reject
the
other.
we
submit
that
as
a
matter
of
state
policy,
article
5-101,
the
general
residuary
statute,
is
a
more
appropriate
statute
of
limitations.
precisely
because
it
covers
more
conceivable
claims
than
would
be
presented
under
49b,
it
is
both
a
residuary
contract
and
a
residuary
tort
statute,
so
unlike
litigation
in
some
other
jurisdictions,
that
would
not
be
a
problem.
it
would
cover
simply
a
greater
variety
of
claims
which
could
be
raised
under
the
federal
civil
right
act.
the
attorney
general
has
just
urged
upon
the
court
in
oral
argument
a
separate
rule
for
public
employees
than
that
enunciated
in
mcnutt.
this
further
complicates
the
multiplicity
of
statute
of
limitations
question,
because
what
the
state
is
in
effect
urging
is
the
separate
statute
of
limitations
for
public
employees,
a
separate
statute
of
limitations
for
private
employees,
and
a
separate
statute
of
limitations
for
everyone
else.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
well,
not
within
49b.
i
mean
49b
applies
to
everyone.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
well,
that's
certainly
true,
but
for
purposes
of
determination
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
a
federal
claim,
i
believe
the
footnote
in
ricks
still
has
a
great
deal
of
vitality.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
i
don't
know
if
absolute
uniformity
is
every
possible.
to
the
greatest
extent
possible,
i
think
within
one
jurisdiction,
since
this
is,
after
all,
one
federal
statute
applying
to
discrimination
claims,
to
the
extent
possible
internal
uniformity
should
be
encouraged
so
that
lay
people
can
more
easily
determine
the
period
within
which
they
have
to
invoke
their
rights.
otherwise,
there
will
be
a
lot
of
litigation
over
the
status
of
the
plaintiff
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
was
invoked
with
the
individuals,
an
independent
contractor,
a
private
or
public
employee.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
is
urging
a
statute
of
limitations
for
public
employees,
then
they
must
be
doing
that
by
virtue
of
the
1983
aspect
of
the
suit.
and
they're
further
complicating
the
question
of
what
statute
of
limitations
would
be
appropriate
outside
of
the
context
of
employment
discrimination
in
1983
litigation.
i
might
point
out
that
in
runyon
v.
mccrary,
one
major
reason
for
the
decision
was
this
court
was
deferring
from
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
a
matter
essentially
of
state
law.
justice
stewart
pointed
this
out
at
427
u.s.
page
181.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
the
9a
complaint
has
to
be
served
on
the
respondent
within
120
days
after
the
filing
of
the
9a
complaint.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
however,
in
two
cases...
the
banach
case
and
the
state
commission
case...
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
special
appeals
have
made
it
very
clear
there
is
a
difference
in
function
between
those
two
notices.
banach
made
clear
that
all
the
9a
complaint
does
is
put
the
respondent
on
notice
that
an
investigation
is
commencing.
the
9a
complaint
need
not
bear
much
of
a
relationship
to
the
ultimate
complaint
which
the
commission
may
issue
to
invoke
section
11
proceedings
after
an
investigation,
and
that
is--
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
--yes.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
yes.
but
according
to
banach,
it
is
not
until
the
section
11
proceedings
are
commenced
that
the
commission
has
stated
a
claim
against
the
respondent
and
the
respondent
is
required
to
answer.
the
state
commission
reaffirmed
banach
to
that
extent.
it
drew
a
distinction
as
far
as
the
case
was
before
it,
in
that
in
that
case,
a
section
9a
complaint
had
been
filed,
the
agency
wished
to
issue
an
investigative
subpoena,
and
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
subpoena
was
adequate,
the
9a
complaint
had
to
at
least
state
how
the
individual
was
discriminated
against.
but
at
page
46,
maryland
appeals
56,
the
banach
court
specifically...
i'm
sorry,
the
state
commission
v.
baltimore
county
court
specifically
reaffirms
the
banach
court
for
the
proposition
that
as
far
as
stating
a
claim,
that
doesn't
have
to
happen
until
the
section
11
proceedings
are
invoked.
ironically,
the
statute
which
the
petitioners
urge
upon
this
court
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
the
use
of
the
very
state
procedures
which
the
petitioners
would
wish
to
encourage,
and
it
in
effect
forces
federal...
i'm
sorry...
forces
individuals
to
invoke
their
federal
rights
in
a
very
rapid
manner,
rights
which
may
not
have
to
be
invoked
if
a
longer
federal
period
were
allowed.
because
of
the
fact
that
an
individual
has
six
months
to
file
a
49b
charge
with
the
commission,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
that
same
period
were
precisely
the
period
within
which
an
individual
has
to
go
to
federal
court,
the
individual
would
very
quickly
be
forced
to
a
choice:
to
either
go
through
with
the
administrative
procedures,
attempting
to
voluntarily
conciliate,
which
serves
both
federal
and
state
interests;
or
file
the
federal
lawsuit
or
forever
lose
those
federal
rights.
the
filing
of
the
litigation
will
have
the
inevitable
effect,
chilling
the
conciliation
procedures
which
the
state
wishes
to
foster.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
well,
i
can
speak
from
personal
experience.
i
used
to
be
a
trial
attorney
with
the
eeoc
for
two
years,
and
at
the
time
that
the
district
courts
in
maryland
began
to
hold
that
the
1981
statute
of
limitations
was
six
months,
in
order
to
preserve
their
rights,
individuals
represented
by
counsel
filed
a
1981
complaint.
inevitably,
the
employer
responded
to
the
eeoc;
we
have
been
sued;
we're
not
going
to
cooperate
in
the
investigation
because
we
don't
want
it
to
be
informal
discovery.
the
reality
is
that
it
has
the
opposite
effect.
it
chills
those
conciliation
procedures
once
an
adversarial
process
has
begun.
i
just
wanted
to
respond
to
several
things
that
the
state
raised.
there
are
30
states
which
appear
to
have
administrative
statutes
of
limitations
similar
to
maryland's
statute
of
limitations.
in
very
few
of
them
have
the
federal
courts
actually
applied
those
statute
of
limitations
to
federal
civil
rights
claims.
as
far
as
the
davidson
v.
koerber
point
that
justice
o'connor
raised,
in
fact
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
was
to
order
the
district
court
to
certify
the
question
to
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
they
didn't
reject
it
out
of
hand.
in
fact,
the
predecessor
of
5-101
did
provide
a
three-year
period
for
actions
under
article
23.
the
only
reason
that
statute
no
longer
exists
is
because
in
1974,
since
there
were
a
number
of
three-year
statutes,
the
maryland
legislature
simplified
the
code
by
codifying
them
into
one
general
residuary
statute...
5-101...
irrespective
of
whether
there
is,
in
fact,
a
cause
of
action
under
article
23.
that
is
an
indication
that
the
maryland
legislature
would
have
intended,
if
there
were
a
cause
of
action,
a
longer
state
statute
of
limitations
to
apply
to
such
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
in
fact,
the
language
you
refer
to
cross-references
to
698
f.
2d
at
678
and
679
in
mcnutt.
and
what
appears
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
banach
case.
that
is
where
the
court
of
appeals
is
getting
its
authority
for
the
maryland
legislative
intent.
i
don't
think
maryland
legislative
intent,
by
the
way,
is
necessarily
controlling
in
this
case.
it
is,
however,
constructive.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
he
refers
to
banach,
which
is
the
interpretation
of
maryland's
highest
fort
on
the
statute.
now,
correct,
in
a
very
narrow
sense,
he's
not
referring
to
legislative
history.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
certainly--
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
--he
did.
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
question
of
federal
law
is
absolutely
correct,
but
in
the
first
instance
what
the
federal
courts
are
to
do
is
to
look
to
state
law.
mr.
sheldon
h.
laskin
right.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
discussed
in
the
banach
opinion,
cited
in
mcnutt.
in
fact,
i
don't
have
the
cites
for
them,
but
there
were
some
turn-of-the-century
maryland
cases
which
at
least
suggested
that
there
was
indeed
a
cause
of
action
under
the
maryland
constitution.
there
are,
however,
no
recent
cases.
i
believe
that
question
is
currently
before
the
maryland
court
of
appeals.
in
summary,
all
this
case
involves
is
a
choice
between
two
state
statutes
of
limitation.
regardless
of
what
decision
this
court
reaches,
a
state
statute
will
be
accepted,
a
state
statute
will
be
rejected.
there
is
no
conflict
presented
between
federal
policy
and
state
policy.
article
5-101
better
accommodates
both
the
state
interests
and
utilizing
state
procedures
and
federal
interests
in
reducing
premature
federal
claims
than
would
49b.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
thank
you.
