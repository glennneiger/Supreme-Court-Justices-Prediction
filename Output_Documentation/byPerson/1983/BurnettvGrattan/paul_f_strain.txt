mr.
paul
farrell
strain
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
arises
from
the
discharge
of
two
state
employees,
the
respondents
here
who
were
members
of
the
administrative
staff
of
the
president
of
coppin
state
college.
the
respondents
are
white.
coppin
state
is
predominantly
black
and
black-managed.
the
respondents
sued,
claiming
racial
discrimination
and,
in
one
case,
sex
discrimination;
and
basing
their
claims
on
the
civil
rights
statutes.
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
of
maryland's
fair
employment
practice
statute
is
the
best
analogy
to
respondents'
suit,
or
whether
the
fact
that
the
fair
employment
statute
remedy
is
not
a
purely
judicial
cause
of
action
makes
it
inappropriate.
i
will
argue
that
maryland's
fair
employment
statute
is
the
wholly
appropriate
analogy;
second,
that
there
are
sound
reasons
of
public
policy
supporting
its
application
to
respondents'
suit;
and
finally,
that
the
maryland
statutory
six-month
limitation
period
is
fully
adequate
for
respondents
to
assert
their
cause
of
action.
as
to
the
first
issue
concerning
the
appropriate
analogy.
maryland's
fair
employment
practice
statute
which
is
article
49b
of
the
maryland
code
is
the
closest
analogy
to
respondents'
suit.
and
in
that
regard,
it
has
almost
no
competition
concerning
which
is
the
analogous
statute.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
respondents
very
definitely
could
not
have
brought
an
action
under
article
23.
let
me
correct
that
slightly.
they
did
bring
an
action
under
article
23,
and
as
the
district
judge
found,
there
is
no
action
under
article
23.
maryland
courts
have
never
recognized
any
direct
action
under
the
maryland
constitution.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
judge
miller
in
the
davidson
case
did
not
address
the
issue
of
whether
maryland
courts
have
recognized
a
direct
action.
judge
miller
did
address
the
issue
of
the
appropriate
analogy,
but
he
was
evidently
not
presented
with
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
such
an
action.
of
course,
if
the
maryland
courts
were
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
direct
cause
of
action
under
the
maryland
constitution,
i
think
for
the
same
considerations
that
led
this
court
in
bush
v.
lucas
not
to
infer
such
a
cause
of
action
where
there
is
a
comprehensive
statutory
scheme,
for
that
same
reason,
i
would
expect
the
maryland
court...
maryland
court
of
appeals
not
to
infer
direct
cause
of
action
for
employment
discrimination.
and
after
all,
that
is
what
respondents
grattan
and
hedman
are
challenging.
their
cause
of
action
is
for
employment
discrimination.
and
article
49b
is
the
state
cause
of
action
for
respondents
grattan
and
hedman,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
where
we
part
company
with
the
respondents
is
in
their
claim
that
the
fact
that
article
49b
is
not
purely
judicial
defeats
the
analogy.
and
i
submit
that
neither
the
language
nor
the
logic
of
this
court's
decisions
justify
respondents'
position.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
recall
that
precise
language
in
chief
judge
winters'
opinion
for
the
fourth
circuit.
i
think
i
recall
language
of
chief
judge
winter
where
he
questioned
whether
the
maryland
legislature
intended
the
fair
employment
statute
to
apply
to
section
1983.
i
don't
think
he
suggested
that
the
catch-all
provision,
article
5-101
of
the
court's
article
was
intended
to
apply
to
section
1983.
if
he
did
say
that,
i
submit
very
respectfully,
he
was
very
wrong.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
if
for
example
the
maryland
legislature
had
intended
the
catch-all
provisions
to
apply
to
civil
rights
statutes,
i
think
that
would
be
important
to
this
court
in
determining
what
was
the
appropriate
analogy.
nonetheless--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--i
think
it
would
not
be
binding,
justice
o'connor.
what
this
court
locks
for
is
the
appropriate
analogy
for
the
individual
section
1983
cause
of
action.
if
it
was
the
maryland
legislature's
intention
that
all
civil
rights
statutes
along
with...
actions...
along
with
many
other
things,
be
governed
by
a
three-year
statute,
that
would
be
a
point
that
this
court
would
consider.
it
would
not
be
binding
on
this
court
anymore
than
would
have
been
the
intention
of
the
new
york
legislature
in
the
actions
to
vacate
arbitration
awards
have
been
binding
on
this
court
in
del
costello
or
united
parcel
service.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
i
think
this
court
has
not
directly
decided
the
issue.
however,
in
the
del
costello
opinion,
there
was
a
footnote...
and
i
don't
recall
the
number
offhand...
but
a
footnote
which
dealt
with
the
argument
that
the
congress,
in
enacting
section
10(b)
of
the
nlra,
had
not
intended
it
to
apply
to
secton
301
suits.
and
this
court
observed
that
the
fact
that
congress
had
not
intended
that
it
apply
to
section
301
suits
was
no
more
dispositive
than
the
fact
that
the
new
york
or
maryland
legislatures
had
not
intended
their
statutes
for
actions
to
vacate
arbitration
awards
to
apply.
and
i
think,
while
this
court
has
not
decided
it,
that
footnote
may
give
a
strong
indication
of
how
this
court
would
go.
and
as
i
said,
i
think
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
language
or
the
logic
of
this
court's
decisions
which
supports
the
respondents'
position
that
a
statute
must
be
purely
judicial
for
borrowing
purposes.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
language
of
this
court's
opinions.
in
the
del
costello
v.
teamsters
opinion
last
term,
this
court
for
a
section
301
suit
borrowed
the
section
10(b)
limitations
period,
and
the
section
10(b)
administrative
judicial
process
is
remarkably
similar
to
that
of
maryland's
article
49b.
in
fact,
the
roots
of
maryland's
article
49b
process
can
be
traced
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
process
and
section
10(b).
and
there
was
no
suggestion
in
any
of
the
three
opinions
of
this
court
that
any
member
of
the
court
thought
that
applying
a
limitations
period
of
a
statute
that
was
not
purely
judicial
was
in
any
way
untoward.
and
it
is
not
only
the
language;
it
is
also
the
logic
of
this
court's
opinions
that
gives
the
respondents
no
support
for
their
position,
because
as
this
court's
opinions
on
borrowing
and
applying
statutes
of
limitations
demonstrate,
what
the
court
is
involved
in
may
be
termed
an
inexorable
search
for
the
appropriate
analogy
based
on
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action,
a
search
for
the
best
fit;
not
a
perfect
fit,
not
something
that
is
hand-in-glove.
as
the
court
observed
in
the
united
parcel
service
opinion,
the
court
does
not
expect
or
search
for
a
hand-in-glove
perfect
analogy,
but
the
best
analogy.
and
for
that
reason...
for
example,
in
section
301
suits
such
as
the
united
auto
workers
v.
hoosier
suit
in
1966,
the
court
searched
for
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action.
was
it
more
appropriate
to
an
action
on
an
oral
contract
or
on
a
written
contract.
and
15
years
later,
in
the
united
parcel
service
opinion,
the
court
made
the
same
inquiry
as
to
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action.
was
it
more
akin
to
an
action
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award
or
more
akin
to
an
action
on
contract?
and
for
section
1983
and
other
civil
rights
suits,
the
inquiry
is
the
same.
the
court
chooses
the
statute
of
limitations
by
borrowing
and
examining
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action,
for
in
section
1983,
even
beyond
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
the
other
principles
that
apply
in
section
301
suits,
in
section
1983
this
court
has
the
benefit
of,
in
section
1988,
congress's
invitation
for
command
to
utilize
the
appropriate
state
limitations
period.
and
the
court
has
examined
appropriate
limitations
periods...
i
should
say
appropriate
causes
of
action
in
1983
suits
to
determine
what
is
the
most
appropriate
analogy.
the
runyon
v.
mccrary
decision
in
1976
is
an
apt
example.
in
that
case,
this
court
rejected
a
five-year
catch-all
limitations
period
for
a
section
1981
suit
in
favor
of
a
two-year
period
that
was...
on
which
a
cause
of
action
depended
that
was
a
better
analogy
for
the
section
1981
suit
there
at
issue.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
very
correct,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
that
was
the
position
in
this
case
because
one
of
the
initial
causes
of
action
was
a
free
speech
claim.
we
argued
for
a
three-year
limitations
period
on
the
section
1983
free
speech
claim.
it
wasn't
within
even
the
three-year
period,
and
the
trial
judge,
judge
ramsey,
knocked
out
the
free
speech
claim
because
it
was
in
violation
of
the
three-year
period.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
well,
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
normally
it
would
not
be
the
same
set
of
facts
out
of
which
the
claim
arises.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
contention
was
either
that
they
were
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
race
or
dismissed
because
they
were
speaking
out.
more
normally,
there
would
be
the
coupling
of
violation
of
a
free
speech
claim
perhaps
that
did
not
lead
to
discharge,
and
discharge
based
on
racial
reasons.
and
the
complaint
should
set
out
those
different
causes
of
action
in
separate
counts,
as
they
did
in
this
case.
so
a
different
limitations
period
would
apply
to
different
counts,
as
if
there
was
a
common
law
account
in
contract
and
account
in
tort.
and
in
summary,
on
the
point
of
the
purely
judicial
cause
of
action,
in
each
of
the
cases
that
have
been
referred
to,
and
in
others,
the
court
has
sought
the
best
analogy.
in
del
costello
last
term,
the
most
appropriate
analogy
was
an
administrative
judicial
limitations
period
in
section
10(b).
and
as
justice
blackmon
observed
for
the
court
in
railway
express
in
1975,
when
we're
talking
about
civil
rights
statutes
nothing
justifies
a
special
reluctance
in
applying
state
law,
as
compared
with
what
the
court
does
in
other
situations
such
as
section
10(b).
article
49b
is
the
state
analogy
to
grattan
and
hedman's
employment
discrimination
suit.
and
article
49b
is
an
administrative
judicial
remedy
that
is
a
lineal
descendent
of
section
10(b)
which
this
court
utilized
last
term
in
del
costello.
the
second
issue
i
wish
to
address
this
morning
concerns
the
sound
policy
reasons
for
borrowing
the
fair
employment
practice
statute,
statute
of
limitations.
an
important
policy
reason
in
favor
of
that
borrowing
is
the
policy
of
uniformity.
now,
this
court
has
observed
that
a
lack
of
uniformity
is
no
reason
to
defeat
an
application
of
state
law.
that
observation
was
made,
for
example,
in
the
temonio...
the
board
of
regents
v.
temonio
opinion
in
1980.
but
here,
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot,
so
to
speak,
because
the
application
of
state
law
will
not
defeat
uniformity,
it
will
promote
uniformity.
as
we
make
clear
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
a
very
long
footnote,
footnote
7,
there
are
at
least
30
states
with
fair
employment
practice
statutes
that
have
limitation
periods
remarkably
similar
to
that
of
maryland.
so
application
of
maryland's
fair
employment
practice
statute
limitation
period
will
promote
national
uniformity
in
this
regard
among
the
states.
it
will
also,
of
course,
promote
uniformity
within
maryland,
because
then
the
state
cause
of
action
and
the
federal
cause
of
action
for
the
same
grievance
or
the
same
matter
will
have
the
same
limitations
period.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
the
statute
of
limitations,
justice
white,
comes
from
a
statute
which
covers
state
employees
and
private
employees.
we
ask
that
it
be
applied
for
several...
our
case,
of
course,
concerns
a
public
employee,
and
we
ask
that
it
be
applied
for
these
public
employees.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
it
says,
justice
white,
that
the
discharged
employee
must
file
a
claim
with
the
maryland
human
relations
commission
within
six
months,
just
as
the
union
employee
must
file
a
claim
of
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
nlrb
within
six
months.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
if
the
claim
is
racial
discrimination,
sex
discrimination,
handicap,
age,
national
origin.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
a
period...
and
i
should
stress
this...
the
administrative
structure
of
article
49b
and
the
maryland
human
relations
commission
is
remarkably
similar
to
the
administrative
structure
of
section
10b
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
the
maryland
code
does
not
have
such
a
set
of
limitations
period
with
that
level
of
specificity.
it
has
the
catch-all
period,
5-101.
it
has
several
other
specific
periods
for
categories
of
actions
such
as
assault
and
battery,
defamation
contracts
under
seal,
and
bonds,
and
things
of
that
sort.
and
in
addition,
within
maryland
statutes,
they
create
a
duty
and
a
remedy.
for
breach
of
the
duty,
there
are
specific
limitations
period
within
those
statutes.
an
example
is
article
49b--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
a
separate
statute
that
addresses
only
limitations.
it
is
contained
within
article
49b
which
creates
the
duty
or
the
right
and
defines
the
remedy.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
other
reason
of
sound
public
policy
that
supports
our
position
here...
i
was
mentioning
the
uniformity
that
would
be
promoted--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--i
didn't
hear
the
last
few
words.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
i
think
uniformity
is
not
a
governing
principle.
this
court
has
made
that
clear,
i
believe,
in
the
board
of
regents
v.
temonio
opinion.
if
the
most
appropriate
analogy
creates
a
lack
of
uniformity,
it
will
be
utilized
nonetheless.
the
point
i
wish
to
make
here
is
that
the
most
appropriate
uniformity
would
have
the
happy
by-product
if
you
will,
of
promoting
national
uniformity.
and
what
that
remarkable
similarity
among
the
states
for
actions
such
as
this
demonstrates
is
that
there
is
a
national
policy
in
favor
of
prompt
resolution
of
employment
disputes,
and
it
isn't
just
among
the
states.
it
is
reflected
in
actions
of
the
united
states
congress,
such
as
title
vii,
and
such
as
10b,
and
in
many,
many
opinions
of
this
court,
the
national
policy
in
favor
of
prompt
resolution
of
employment
disputes,
and
i--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--justice
o'connor,
if
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
shorter
period
was
not
intended
to
apply,
which
it
did
not--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--it
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
o'connor,
that
passage
is
referring
to
article
64a,
a
grievance
period
that
is
an
alternative
limitations
period.
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--yes.
and
i
would
like
to
respond
very
directly
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
what
the
fourth
circuit
was
looking
for
was
any
indication
that
the
maryland
legislature
had
1983
in
mind
one
way
or
the
other
when
it
created
the
six-month
period.
it
did
not.
nor
did
the
maryland
legislature
have
section
1983
suits
in
mind
when
it
created
the
three-year
catch-all
period.
it
would
be
unrealistic--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--then,
justice
o'connor,
we
get
back
to
the
issue
that
we
discussed
before
and
that
was
of
what
significance
would
that
be
to
this
court.
my
position
is,
that
would
be
of
some
significance.
but
as
this
court
noted
in
the
del
costello
opinion,
the
fact
that
congress
in
section
10b
did
not
intend
that
it
be
utilized
for
section
301
suits
was
no
more
dispositive
than
the
fact
that
the
new
york
legislature
did
not
intend
an
action
to
vacate
an
arbitration
award
to
be
used
for
that
section.
but
i
want
to
emphasize,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
there
is
no
more
indication
that
the
maryland
legislature
intended
the
three-year
period
to
apply
to
section
1983
than
it
intended
the
six-month
period
to
apply.
it
had
no
intention
about
section
1983
as
to
either
of
those
two
statutory
periods.
the
maryland
legislature...
there
is
no
indication
it
ever
thought
about
it.
legislative
history
in
maryland
is
very
skimpy,
but
there
is
no
indication
it
had
either
statutory
period
in
mind.
our
position
is
that
on
the
question
of
legislative
intention,
it
very
simply
is
a
wash,
and
that
avenue
is
a
blind
avenue
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
yes,
justice
marshall,
there
is.
i
would
point
out
as
well
that
the
author
of
the
district
court
opinion
who
disagreed
with
judge
winter
and
was
reversed
by
the
fourth
circuit
was
also
from
maryland.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
wouldn't
be
so
bold,
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
the
attorney
general's
office
was
not
involved
in
the
mcnutt
case.
as
i
recall,
that
was
a
private
employment
dispute.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
i
honestly
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
or
not.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct.
judge
winter
relied
on
mcnutt
which,
of
course,
was
decided
prior
to
del
costello.
and
in
mcnutt,
what
seems
to
me
to
have
been
at
least
one
motivating
factor
for
the
mcnutt
opinion
was
that
they
thought
it
was
wholly
inappropriate
to
use
the
limitations
period
of
article
49b
because
they
said
it
was
administrative.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct.
and
i
would
suggest
respectfully
to
the
fourth
circuit
that
mcnutt...
the
reasoning
of
mcnutt
has
been
completely
obviated
by
this
court's
opinion
in
del
costello.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
now--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--justice
stevens,
that
time
comes
after
the
administrative
adjudication.
the
complainant,
the
employee,
may
appeal
an
adverse
decision
of
the
administrative
agency.
and
so
it
is
unlike
title
vii
where
there
is
an
independent
cause
of
action,
and
very
similar
to
section
10b
where
there
is
an
adjudication
by
the
nlrb
and
then
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
he
cannot
bring
his
own
damage
action.
he
gets
review
under
the
maryland
administrative
procedure
act.
that
review
is
a
fairly
robust
or
vigorous
judicial
review,
more
detailed,
more
robust,
i
would
say,
than
the
form
of
judicial
review
that
this
court
observed
in
the
new
york
fair
employment
practice
commission
in
the
kroemer
case,
because
the
reviewing
court
in
maryland
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
does
get
into
the
issue
of
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
raised
by
my
colleague
of
a
different
time
period
within
article
49b,
there
is
suggestion
that
there
is
a
longer
time
period
for
an
administrative
complaint.
there
is
only
one
time
period
within
article
49b.
that
is,
the
six-month
period.
that
structure,
is
as
i
said,
a
lineal
descendant
of
that
in
section
10b.
there
is
a
commission
complaint
procedure,
rarely
used,
not
even
dependent
upon
an
individual
grievance
and
as
to
which
there
is
no
limitations
period
whatsoever.
what
my
colleague
has
confused
with
a
second
limitation
period
is
actually
a
provision
that
after
investigation
and
a
judicial-like
weighing
of
the
facts,
the
commission
general
counsel's
office
shall
precede
a
hearing
with
a
statement
of
charges.
this
gets
us
into
the
minutiae
of
article
49b
process,
but
i
cannot
emphasize
enough
that
there
is
only
one
limitations
period
within
article
49b.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
well,
justice
white,
i--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--well,
in
point
of
fact,
justice
white,
the
human
relations
commission,
the
maryland
human
relations
commission,
like
the
eeoc,
has
a
procedure
called
"rapid
charge
processing"
which
results
in
a
fact-finding,
face-to-face,
across-the-table
conference
within
one
month.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
justice
white,
no.
what
i
would
do
is
take
advantage
of
the
rapid
charge
processing
which
guarantees
me
an
across-the-table
conference
within
one
month,
and
then
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
conciliation,
whether
there
was
any
reasonable
chance
of
conciliation.
if
i
thought
there
was,
then
i
would
go
forward
with
conciliation.
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
and
forego
the
federal
suit,
or
as
justice
rehnquist's
question
suggested,
file
a
protective
suit
in
the
district
court
and
ask
the
court
to
hold
it
abeyance
for
an
appropriate
period
of
time,
because
the
average
processing
time
for
the
maryland
human
relations
commission
now
for
the
average
case
is
six
months
only,
and
i
don't
think
on
this
matter
of--
mr.
paul
farrell
strain
--after
filing;
that's
correct.
and
i
don't
think
that
on
this
matter
of
policy,
that
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
was
any
more
intended
to
serve
as
a
second
bite
at
the
apple
than
this
court
concluded
on
a
similar
question
in
temonio
and
the
railway
express
cases
where
these
same
chilling
arguments
were
made
and
rejected
by
this
court.
i
thank
you
very
much.
