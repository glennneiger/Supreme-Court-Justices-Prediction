unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
i
notice
that
the
respondent
cited
a
case,
federal
case
davidson
v.
koerber
that
referred
to
article
23
of
the
maryland
declaration
of
rights,
in
which
the
district
court
held
that
it's
beyond
dispute
that
maryland's
article
23
protects
the
same
interests
as
the
14th
amendment,
and
therefore
section
1983.
you
think
the
respondents
could
have
brought
an
action
under
article
23
in
this
case,
then,
in
maryland?
unknown
speaker
despite
that
davidson
v.
koerber
case;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strain,
the
court
of
appeals,
though,
said
that
the
maryland
legislature
intended
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
period
to
apply
to
section
1983
actions.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
legislative
body
expressly
said
it
intended
a
longer
statute
of
limitations
to
apply,
would
you
give
recognition
to
that?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
binding
on
us?
unknown
speaker
although
i
guess
we
haven't
really
decided
that
question,
have
we?
whether
a
legislative
express
intention
would
be
binding.
unknown
speaker
general
strain,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
underlying
claim
of
a
constitutional
violation
here
didn't
involve
discrimination,
but
rather,
was
something
like
a
first
amendment
claim
or
something
like
that;
the
employee
was
discharged
for
speaking
out
about
some
issue.
i
take
it
you
would
then
say
that
that
particular
1983
claim...
the
limitations
period
for
such
an
1983
claim
would
be
determined
by
some
other
statute,
other
than
the
one
you're--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
not
contending
all
1983
are
subject
to
this?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
certain
practical
awkwardness
about
that
result,
isn't
there?
if
a
person
is
suing
for
unconstitutional
dismissal
from
employment,
to
the
extent
his
claim
may
sound
in
free
speech,
it's
three
years;
to
the
extent
it
may
sound
in
racial
discrimination,
it's
a
much
different
period
of
time,
even
though
it's
the
same
facts
perhaps
out
of
which
the
thing
arises.
unknown
speaker
is
the
statute
of
limitations
that
you
want
borrowed
for
this
purpose
in
connection
with
the
discharge
of
a
state
employee?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
limitations
period
say?
does
it
say
that
the
discharged
employee
must
sue
in
the
state
court
within
a
certain
time?
unknown
speaker
if
the
claim
is
what...
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
period
you're
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
period
connected
with
any
kind
of
a
court
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
does
the
maryland
code
of
statutes
have
a
section
on
limitations
generally
and
limitations
for
different
kinds
of
judicial
proceedings,
like
the
limit
actions
in
torts?
unknown
speaker
the
specific
provision
you
rely
on,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the...
it's
really
just
one
sentence
in
section
9a
of
the
statutory
scheme
for
this
relief
against
discrimination.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
a
separate
limitations
statute
in
the
sense
that
these
others
are?
unknown
speaker
and
more
narrowly,
it's
contained
within
subsection
(a)
of
section
9
of
49b.
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
mr.
strain,
i
wonder
whether
national
uniformity
can
be
said
to
be
the
applicable
policy
if
we're
looking
to
section
1988
which
tells
us
that
if
the
federal
law
is
deficient,
we
look
to
state
law.
and
we
know
state
laws
can
differ
from
state
to
state.
so
i
wonder
if
national
uniformity
is
a
goal.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
if
national
uniformity
is
a
governing
principle
in
light
of
section
1988.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
strain,
if
section
1988
tells
us
to
look
at
state
law,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
maryland
legislature
did
not
intend
the
shorter
period
to
apply,
why
doesn't
that
have
to
inform
our
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
did
say
that,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
look
at
the...
the
fourth
circuit
said
that,
did
it
not?
it
said,
for
instance,
in
the
appendix
with
the
petition,
reciting
the
history
and
referring
to
article
49b,
"this,
too,
indicates
that
the
maryland
legislature
did
not
intend
that
the
passing
of
165-day
period
should
bar
an
employee.
"
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
and
earlier
it
said
"it
is
for
this
reason
it
was
unlikely
the
maryland
legislature
intended
that
this
limitations
period
apply
to
civil
actions.
"
meaning
49b.
i
certainly
read
the
opinion
anyway
as
indicating
ca4
thought
the
maryland
legislature
did
not
intend
the
shorter
period
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
ca4
meant
what
i
said
i
thought
it
meant;
namely,
that
maryland
didn't
intend
the
shorter
period
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
significance
that
the
writer
of
this
opinion,
chief
judge
winter,
is
from
maryland.
unknown
speaker
and
that
you
are,
too.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
going
to
go
that
far,
you
are,
too.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
were
you
involved
or
was
the...
i
suppose
the
attorney
general's
office
was
involved
in
the
mcnutt
case...
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
there
was
never
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
case
that
judge
winter
thought
was
controlling
here.
unknown
speaker
administrative,
yes.
unknown
speaker
not
entirely,
general
strain,
because
there's
a
footnote
in
the
mcnutt
opinion
pointing
out
the
irony
of
relying
on
a
maryland
administrative
procedure
rather
than
a
federal
administrative
procedure.
do
you
remember
that
footnote?
that
you
might
as
well
look
to
the
title
vii,
the
180-day
provision
in
title
vii,
if
you're
going
to
do
that.
and
in
del
costello,
we
looked
to
a
federal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
could
you
help
me
on
one
thing?
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
but
under
your
49b,
the
equivalent
of
title
vii,
does
a
time
come
when
the
alleged
victim
of
discrimination
may
bring
some
kind
of
a
judicial
proceeding
and,
if
so,
when?
unknown
speaker
he
only
gets
review
of
the
administrative...
he
can't
then
bring
his
own
damage
action?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
great
many
differences
by
statutes
and
otherwise,
are
there
not,
among
those
categories?
unknown
speaker
i'm
speaking
of
other
relationships
that
are
different
in
the
private
and
the
public
sector.
in
other
words,
in
the
private
sector
if
you
had
a
labor
contract,
that
might
control.
and
if
the
public
sector
if
there
was
no
labor
contract
in
that
state,
you
would
still
have
another
one.
that's
the
only
point
i
would
suggest.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
an
absolute
uniformity
has
some
special
merit?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
referred
in
1983
as
authorizing
the
bringing
of
discrimination
on
claims.
actually,
it's
any
right
secured
by
federal
law
or
constitution.
you
look
at
some
of
our
cases
like
sea
clammers
and
so
forth,
and
other
cases
where
it's
been
argued
there
is
a
private
right
arising
under
the
various
statutes.
it's
hard
to
say
1983
just
deals
with
discrimination--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
go
back
on
one
question?
i
think
you
mentioned
that
under
the
maryland
49b
procedure,
it
might
be
two
years
and
ten
months
before
the
complaint
was
served.
but
is
it
not
correct
that
under
that
procedure,
at
least
the
administrative
complaint
must
be
served
on
the
employer
within
four
months
or
something
like
that,
after
the
charge
is
filed?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
defendant
would
at
least
get
some
notice
within
no
more
than
ten
months.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
tell
the
employer
who
filed
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
knows
who's
making
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
why
should
that
necessarily
be
so,
mr.
laskin?
i
would
thank
if
both
parties
told
the
judge
in
the
federal
court
before
whom
the
action
were
filed
that
they
were
still
going
on
state
conciliation
proceedings,
the
judge
would
not
force
them
to
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
best
reading
of
the
ca4
opinion
is
regarding
the
legislative
intent?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
see
that
judge
haynsworth
referred
at
all
to
legislative
intent
in
mcnutt.
unknown
speaker
but,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
says
that
he's
just
as
able...
this
isn't
a
question
of
state
law;
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
he
rejected
any
notion
that
the
federal
court
shouldn't
independently
choose
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
rejected
the
suggestion
that
the
question
be
certified,
but
earlier
he
said
a
relatively
short
limitations
period
was
clearly
thought
by
the
maryland
legislature
as
appropriate
to
such
an
administrative
proceeding,
but
it
does
not
appear
appropriate
for
applications
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
common
sense
argument
that
utilization
of
the
state
procedure
will
be
considerably
discouraged
by
such
a
short
statute
for
filing
suit?
unknown
speaker
because
those
agencies
move
rather
slowly
sometimes,
after
a
complaint
is
filed.
unknown
speaker
if
there's
the
same
limitations
period
for
filing
a
federal
suit
as
there
is
for
filing
a
complaint
with
the
commission...
that's
your
argument...
that
it
should
be.
unknown
speaker
what
is
somebody
supposed
to
do...
file
both
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court
and
one
in
the
human
relations
commission?
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
the
lawyer?
wouldn't
you
just
pass
up
the
state
commission?
unknown
speaker
and
forego
the
federal
suit?
unknown
speaker
that's
after
filing.
