mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
in
this
case
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
in
effect
every
other
government
agency,
must
provide
to
the
so-called
targets
of
its
nonpublic
investigations
notice
whenever
it
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
so-called
third
party.
we've
sought
certiorari
because
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
is
without
any
basis
in
the
law,
conflicts
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
threatens
to
impede
law
enforcement
investigations
by
the
sec
and
other
administrative
agencies.
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
this
case
can
be
briefly
stated.
in
september
1980,
the
commission
issued
a
formal
order,
authorizing
its
staff
to
begin
a
private
investigation
into
possible
violations
of
the
securities
laws
in
connection
with
certain
mining
stocks.
several
of
the
respondents
were
named
in
this
formal
order.
during
the
course
of
the
investigation,
the
commission
staff
issued
subpoenas
to
the
respondents
and
several
other
people.
shortly
thereafter,
respondents
brought
this
suit
to
enjoin
the
investigation
on
the
grounds
that
the
commission's
formal
order
was
defective,
and
that
the
staff
was
proceeding
with
the
investigation
improperly.
respondents
also
claimed
that
as
the
so-called
targets
of
this
investigation,
they
were
entitled
to
be
notified
of
all
subpoenas
issued
to
people
other
than
themselves
during
the
course
of
the
investigation.
the
district
court
denied
all
of
this
relief.
the
court
held
that
respondents
had
available
to
them
an
adequate
remedy
of
law
for
challenging
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
investigation
as
it
was
directed
to
them,
simply
by
defending
against
any
proceedings
that
might
be
brought
against
them.
and
the
district
court
also
declined
to
fashion
what
it
called
the
novel
remedy
of
requiring
that
the
commission
give
notice
to
targets
whenever
it
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
third
party.
the
district
court
held
in
this
regard
that
respondent
had
no
legally
cognizable
interest
in
preventing
compliance
with
subpoenas
issued
to
anyone
other
than
themselves.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
denial
of
injunctive
relief,
challenging
the
sec's
actions
directed
at
respondents.
but,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
as
to
the
so-called
third
party
notice
issue.
the
essence
of
the
court
of
appeal's
reasoning
seems
to
be
the
following
two
sentences
from
its
opinion,
which
are
reprinted
at
page
7a
cf
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition,
the
last
two
sentences
in
the
first
paragraph
on
page
7a,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
and
i
quote:
"while
respondents
lack
any
right
to
maintain
confidentiality
of
information
held
by
third
parties,
they
do
have
the
right
to
be
investigated
consistently
with
the
powell
standards.
"
here,
the
court
of
appeals
is
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
powell,
which
simply
concerned
what
an
administrative
agency
must
show
in
order
to
get
judicial
enforcement
of
its
subpoenas.
the
court
then
goes
on
to
says:
"to
assure
that
the
target
has
the
opportunity
to
assert
this
right.
"
this
so-called
right
to
be
investigated
consistently
with
the
powell
standards,
"notice
of
third
party
subpoenas
is
necessary.
"
the
ninth
circuit
therefore
ordered
the
commission
to
notify
the
targets
of
its
investigation,
a
term
it
did
not
define,
whenever
the
commission
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
third
party.
and
this
is
all
apparently
so
that
the
target
can
bring
some
sort
of
legal
proceedings,
to
assure
that
the
subpoena
to
the
third
party
complies
with
the
powell
standards.
now,
one
of
the
problems
one
has
in
analzying
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
from
the
court's
short
and
somewhat
cryptic
opinion,
exactly
what
source
of
legal
authority
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
relying
on
in
imposing
this
unprecedented
notice
requirement.
it
seems
tolerably
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
relying
on
any
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
respondents
seem
to
concede
as
much.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
cases
such
as
hannah
v.
larche
and
fisher
v.
united
states,
united
states
v.
miller,
leave
little
doubt
that
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
don't
give
anyone
a
protectable
interest
in
records
held
by
third
parties,
don't
give
anyone
the
right
or
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
validity
of
subpoenas
for
records
held
by
third
parties.
it
also
seems
fairly
clear
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
it
wasn't
relying
on
any
expressed
provisions
of
the
securities
laws,
because
the
statutes
that
govern
the
sec's
issuance
of
subpoenas
don't
contain
any
requirement
that
the
commission
notify
so-called
targets
of
its
investigations
each
time
it
issues
a
subpoena
to
a
third
party.
the
fact
is,
i
hope
to
discuss
in
a
few
moments,
when
congress
has
wanted
to
require
the
commission
to
give
notice
of
its
subpoenas
to
someone
other
than
a
subpoena
recipient,
it
has
said
so
expressly
in
carefully
crafted
legislation.
but
there
is
no
legislation
that
requires
that
the
commission
notify
so-called
targets
when
it
issues
subpoenas
to
third
parties.
and
the
ninth
circuit's
sole
reason
for
imposing
this
novel
third
party
notice
requirement
is
apparently
based
on
its
construction
of
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
powell.
as
i
noted
a
moment
ago,
in
reading
from
a
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
understood
powell
as
creating
a
right
in
so-called
targets
of
an
agency's
investigation
to
be
investigated
consistently
with
the
powell
standards.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
can
understand
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning,
it
seems
to
have
concluded
that
notices
to
third
parties
is
essential
to
protect
this
so-called
right
to
be
investigated
consistently
with
the
powell
standards,
and
this
is
so
because
in
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
apparently,
third
party
recipients
of
subpoenas
who
are
not
targets
of
an
agency's
investigation
would
not
have
standing
to
suggest
that
the
subpoena
somehow
failed
to
satisfy
the
powell
standards.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
obvious
flaws
in
the
court
of
appeals
analysis.
the
principal
problem,
of
course,
is
that
powell
has
absolutely
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
how
administrative
agencies
go
about
conducting
their
investigations.
powell
singly
holds
that
if
an
agency
can't
get
voluntary
compliance
with
a
request
for
information,
it
has
to
make
certain
showings
in
order
to
get
judicial
enforcement
of
its
subpoenas.
the
purpose
of
this
rule,
as
the
court
noted
in
powell,
is
to
protect
the
enforcement
court's
own
processes,
not
to
superintend
investigations
conducted
by
agencies.
and,
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals'
somewhat
puzzling
assumption,
which
i
think
to
some
extent
underlies
its
whole
notice
requirement,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
recipient
of
an
administrative
subpoena
would
have
standing
to
insist
on
compliance
with
the
powell
standards,
whether
or
not
the
recipient
of
the
subpoena
was
a
target.
in
fact,
this
court's
decision
in
lasalle
national
bank,
a
few
years
ago,
was
a
case
in
which
a
recipient
of
a
subpoena
raised
so-called
powell
claims.
the
target
wasn't
even
a
party
to
that
judicial
enforcement
proceeding.
but
powell
only
concerns
the
rights
of
subpoena
recipients.
the
decision
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
rights
of
third
parties,
much
less
anything
about
requiring
that
third
parties
be
given
notice...
rather,
targets
be
given
notice
when
subpoenas
are
issued
to
third
parties.
and
in
this
respect,
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
of
powell
seems
quite
inconsistent
with
this
court's
subsequent
decisions
in
mueller
and
donaldson,
because
mueller
and
donaldson,
in
fact,
unlike
powell,
did
involve
third
party
subpoenas
and
the
rights
of
third
parties,
and
this
court
held
in
both
cases
that
the
target
of
an
investigation
has
not
legally
cognizable
interest
in
questioning
whether
a
subpoena
issued
to
someone
else
should
be
judicially
enforced.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
assuming
the
target
had
notice
of
it,
he
could--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--assuming
the
target
had
notice,
under
this
court's
decision
in
donaldson,
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
seek
permissive
intervention,
and
i
think
that
donaldson
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
standards
of
rule
24b
are
to
apply,
the
normal
equitable
standards
of
determining
whether
permissive
intervention
should
be
granted.
but
donaldson
makes
quite
clear
that
a
target,
under
no
circumstances,
would
have
a
right
of
intervention
under
rule
24a
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that
was
precisely,
in
fact,
the
argument
that
this
court
rejected
in
donaldson.
in
fact,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
seems
flatly
inconsistent
with
donaldson,
because
in
donaldson...
donaldson,
as
the
court
will
recall,
was
the
target
of
an
irs
investigation,
and
he
sought
to
intervene
in
a
then-pending
judicial
enforcement
proceeding.
but
the
court
noted
that
donaldson
had
no
interest
in
the
materials
that
were
subpoenaed,
other
than
to
try
to
prevent
the
agency
from
getting
ahold
of
them
so
that
they
might
not
be
used
against
him.
this
court
held
that
that
interest
was
not
even
strong
enough
to
allow
donaldson
to
have
a
right
of
intervention
in
pending
enforcement
proceedings.
so
it
seems
quite
bizarre
that
that
same
interest,
which
is
the
only
interest
that
respondents
have
in
this
case,
is
strong
enough
to
entitle
them
to
notice
simply
the
issuance
of
subpoenas.
we
don't
know
of
any
circumstance
in
which
potential
permissive
intervenors,
which
is
all
these
respondents
are,
have
a
right
to
be
given
notice
of
the
occurrence
of
an
event...
here,
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena...
that
might
or
might
not
ultimately
lead
to
judicial
enforcement
proceedings,
in
which
they
would,
at
most,
have
the
opportunity
to
seek
permissive
intervention.
in
fact,
rule
24
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
doesn't
even
require
that
notice
be
given
to
someone
who
has
an
absolute
right
to
intervene
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
so
it
seems
quite
peculiar
that
only
a
potential
permissive
intervenor
would
have
to
be
given...
would
have
to
be
given
notice.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
to
the
extent
that
powell
standard
overlap
fourth
amendment
standards
set
out
in
cases
like
oklahoma
press,
and
to
a
large
extent
i
think
they
do,
then,
of
course,
the
sec
would
have
to
make
the
same
showing
at
a
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding.
there
are,
however,
certain
elements
of
the
powell
test,
such
as
the
third
element,
that
the
ibs
not
already
have
the
information
in
its
possession,
which
i
think
were
simply
construction
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
those--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct.
and
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
it
is
simply
a
construction
of
the
statute,
it
would
not
apply
to
other
agencies.
however,
as
i
say,
some
of
the
elements
of
the
powell
test,
such
as
that
the
subpoena
be
issued
for
a
legitimate
purpose
and
that
it
be
relevant,
seek
relevant
information,
are,
i
think,
simply
fourth
amendment
standards.
and
to
that
extent,
of
course,
the
sec
and
other
agencies
would
have
to
meet
it
as
well.
so,
to
sum
up,
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
and
it
didn't
purport
to
identify
one.
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
and
it
didn't
purport
to
identify
one.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
seems
to
be
based
on
a
plain
misreading
of
the
powell
case
in
two
respects:
(1)
that
powell
grants
rights
to
so-called
targets
of
an
investigation,
and
(2)
that
recipients
of
a
subpoena
who
are
not
targets
would
somehow
not
have
standing
to
challenge
the
subpoena
on
powell
grounds.
both
of
those
assumptions
are
plainly
incorrect.
and,
finally,
the
relief
awarded
here,
which
is
providing
notice,
seems
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
decision
in
donaldson,
which
held
that
targets
of
investigations
don't
even
have
a
right
of
intervention
in
a
pending
judicial
enforcement
proceeding.
that
being
so,
it
seems
inconceivable
that
they
could
have
a
right
to
greater
relief,
which
is
notice,
such
as
the
ninth
circuit
ordered
here.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
of
tremendous
concern
to
the
sec
and
other
administrative
agencies,
not
simply
because
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
wrong...
which
it
is...
and
not
simply
because
it
would
be
tremendously
quite
burdensome
administratively
to
try
to
apply
this
test.
it's
not
clear
what
a
target
is;
the
sec
often
investigates
transactions
rather
than
individuals,
and
it
would
be
quite
burdensome
to
try
to
figure
out
who
has
to
get
notice.
but
what
really
concerns
the
government
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
notice
requirement,
will
severely
impair
the
ability
of
the
sec
and
other
agencies
to
conduct
effective
law
enforcement
investigations.
and
the
reason
for
this
are
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
consistently
explained
in
upholding
the
need
for
secrecy
in
the
grand
jury.
if
targets
of
a
commission's
investigation
had
to
be
told
at
the
very
outset
the
names
of
the
people
who
are
being
served
with
subpoenas
by
the
sec,
then,
of
course,
the
target
would
have
essentially
a
road
map
of
the
commission's
investigations.
it
would
increase
the
target's
opportunity
to
fabricate
defenses
or
destroy
evidence,
intimidate
witnesses,
tailor
testimony,
perhaps
secrete
assets
beyond
the
reach
of
the
sec
or
injured
investors.
and,
in
addition,
many
people,
especially
cooperative,
confidential
informants,
might
decline
to
cooperate
with
the
sec
if
they
knew
that
their
names
would
immediately
have
to
be
given
over
to
the
targets,
to
so-called
targets
of
the
investigation.
and
i
should
add
that
this
is
not
a
speculative
or
fanciful
concern
on
the
sec's
part.
in
the
wedbush
case,
which
was
a
follow-up
to
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
district
court
ordered
the
sec
to
provide
the
targets
of
that
investigation
with
the
names
of
subpoena
recipients.
the
sec
sought
a
stay
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
specifically
argued...
and
this
is
on
page
28a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition...
specifically
argued
that
some
of
the
third
party
witnesses
had
requested
confidentiality,
and
the
disclosure
of
these
witnesses
to
the
target
would
impair
the
effectiveness
of
the
investigation.
despite
this,
the
ninth
circuit
summarily
denied
a
stay
in
wedbush
and
ordered
the
sec
to
provide
the
so-called
targets
of
that
investigation,
with
the
names
of
third
party
subpoena
recipients.
finally,
providing
notice
would
tremendously
increase
the
opportunities
for
delay
in
conducting
an
investigation,
and
would
prejudice
the
privacy
rights
of
people
called
to
testify
or
produce
evidence
in
the
investigation.
these
consequences
are
important,
we
believe,
because
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
them,
at
least
without
expressly
saying
so.
and,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
there's
no
provision
of
the
securities
laws
that
requires
this
sort
of
notice,
and
in
this
regard,
it's
extremely
significant
that
congress
has
enacted
legislation
that
does,
in
very
limited
circumstances,
require
the
sec
and
other
agencies
to
give
notice
to
certain
types
of
people
when
subpoenas
have
been
served
on
third
parties.
section
21h
of
the
securities
exchange
act
incorporates
the
right
to
financial
privacy
act,
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
1978.
and
the
right
to
financial
privacy
act
creates
a
limited
exception
to
this
rule
by
providing
that
the
sec
and
other
agencies
have
to
give
customers
of
banks
notice
when
administrative
agencies
serve
subpoenas
on
banks
for
the
private
records
of
these
customers.
now,
i
think
the
enactment
of
section
21h
and
the
right
to
financial
privacy
act
is
very
instructive,
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
shows
that
congress
clearly
knows
how
to
provide
for
a
notice
requirement
when
it
wants
to
do
so.
and
the
debates
on
section
21h
in
the
right
to
financial
privacy
act
leave
no
doubt
that
congress
thought,
when
it
was
enacting
those
statutes,
that
there
was
no
sort
of
requirement
in
the
law
previous
to
that
point,
such
as
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
discovered
in
this
case.
and
secondly,
i
think
the
enactment
of
section
21h
is
quite
instructive,
because
when
congress
did
impose
a
notice
requirement,
it
quickly
surrounded
that
requirement
with
a
number
of
protections
designed
to
prevent
the
sort
of
harms
that
i
was
discussing
a
few
moments
ago.
and,
needless
to
say,
th
ninth
circuit's
ruling
does
not
contain
any
of
these
protections,
nor
could
it.
we
think
what
all
of
this
shows
is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
represents
nothing
more
than
that
court's
notion
of
what
constitutes
sound
public
policy,
and
even
if
th
court
of
appeals
were
right
in
that
judgment,
and
we
doubt
that
it
was,
it
was
not
a
judgment
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
entitled
to
make.
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
requirement
that
the
sec
or
other
agencies
give
notice
to
the
so-called
targets
of
its
investigations,
and
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
power
to
order
it.
we
think
what
this
court
said
only
a
few
weeks
ago,
in
the
arthur
young
case,
is
extremely
relevant
here.
there,
the
court
said,
this
kind
of
policy
choice,
restricting
agency
investigative
power,
is
best
left
to
the
legislative
branch.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
