mr.
william
d.
symmes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
divide
my
argument,
with
the
court's
permission,
into
two
parts.
first,
i
would
like
to
address
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
why
it's
correct,
why
we
believe
it
should
be
upheld,
and
secondly,
respond
to
counsel's
argument,
in
that
order.
this
court,
back
in
1964,
handed
down
the
reisman
decision.
the
reisman
decision
essentially
said
four
things.
firstly,
it
said
that
a
target
of
any
agency
investigation
has
remedy
for
unlawful
subpoenas
of
for
agency
subpoenas
which
have
been
issued
in
excess
of
or
in
abuse
of
statutory
authority.
that
case
specifically
was
not
limited
just
to
the
recipient
of
agency
process.
the
language
of
that
case
stated
that
not
only
may
the
recipient
intervene,
but
also
any
party
who
is
affected
by
the
agency
process.
the
reisman
decision
went
on
to
say
that
the
remedy
for
this
situation
is
the
opportunity
to
intervene,
the
opportunity
to
intervene
in
the
subpoena
enforcement
action
that
would
occur
in
order
to
enforce
the
third
party
subpoenas.
the
court
went
on...
i
think
this
is
very
important...
to
say
in
the
reisman
case,
that
to
preserve
that
remedy
of
intervention,
the
affected
person
may
seek
a
restraining
order
to
restrain
the
compliance
of
the
third
party
witness
with
the
outstanding
subpoenas,
pending
hearing
at
the
subpoena
enforcement
hearing.
and
the
fourth
thing...
this
is
very
important...
the
reisman
case
said
was
that,
at
this
subpoena
enforcement
hearing,
the
recipient
or
the
target,
the
person
affected
by
the
outstanding
subpoena,
whether
it
be
the
target
or
the
recipient,
may
challenge
the
subpoena
or
summons,
the
administrative
summons
or
subpoena,
on
any
appropriate
ground,
including
for
improper
purpose
or...
i
think
the
example
they
gave
was
violation
of
the
attorney/client
privilege.
eleven
months
later...
and
this
is
important
to
understand
from
the
standpoint
of
how
the
ninth
circuit
reached
its
conclusion...
eleven
months
later,
1964,
this
same
court
handed
down
the
decision
in
powell.
and
in
powell,
this
court
elaborated
on
what
it
meant
by
the
appropriate
grounds
for
challenging
an
abusive
or
excessive
outstanding
subpoena
or
administrative
summons.
at
that
time,
powell
listed
at
least
four
grounds.
now,
the
counsel
arguing
today
for
the
sec
has
conceded
at
least
three
of
those
grounds
would
be
applicable
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
the
issuance
of
process.
the
first
is,
the
subpoena
must
be
issued
for
legitimate
purpose.
the
second
is
that
the
information
or
document
sought
must
be
relevant
to
that
purpose.
and,
lastly,
that
the
agency,
in
the
course
of
conducting
its
investigation
and
issuing
its
process,
must
be
in
compliance
with
its
own
rules.
now,
this
court
reasserted
or
reaffirmed
its
position
taken
in
both
reisman
and
in
powell
in
the
lasalle
case,
which
counsel
mentioned
in
his
opening
statement.
now,
at
that
point,
the
ninth
circuit
had
before
it
both
the
reisman
and
the
powell
case.
and
what
it
concluded
was
this...
i
think
the
conclusion
is
well
contained
within
both
reisman
and
powell...
that
in
order
for
a
person
affected
by
an
outstanding
abusive
or
excessive
subpoena...
that
is
to
say,
in
order
for
a
target
to
intervene,
as
reisman
said
he
could...
granted,
it's
permissive;
we
don't
say
it's
absolute...
in
order
for
such
a
target
or
affected
person
to
not
only
intervene,
to
obtain
a
restraining
order,
and
challenge
the
subpoena
on
appropriate
grounds,
that
affected
person
or
target
must
be
aware
of
the
outstanding
process
in
which
he
has
a
protectable
interest,
if
the
subpoena
seeks
information
that's
not
legitimate
to
the
purpose
of
the
investigation,
or
if
it
seeks
information
of
documents
which
are
not
relevant
to
that
purpose,
or
if
in
the
conduct
of
investigation
the
agency
is
violating
its
own
rules.
therefore,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
in
order
for
the
target
or
affected
person
under
peisman
and
powell
to
intervene,
to
challenge,
to
get
a
restraining
order,
in
order
to
do
this
he
must
have
notice.
therefore--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--not
my
reading.
i
think
donaldson,
your
honor,
clarified
reisman
and
powell,
clarified
that
intervention
exists,
not
as
a
matter
of
right;
it's
a
permissive
intervention.
but
the
fact
that
it's
permissive
intervention
doesn't
rule
out,
doesn't
logically
or,
in
my
mind,
persistently
preclude
the
issuance
of
notice,
particularly--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--first
of
all,
donaldson
did
not
say
that
no
notice
was
required.
neither
donaldson
nor
reisman
nor
powell
ruled
out
notice.
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
target
or
affected
person
under
donaldson
is
permissibly
entitled
to
intervene
by
itself
doesn't
preclude
notice.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
our
answer
would
be
simply
this;
that
under
donaldson
or
powell
or
reisman,
a
target
doesn't
even
have
the
opportunity
to
intervene,
can't
even
exercise,
if
you'll
forgive
the
phrase,
permissive
intervention
unless
he
knows
about
the
outstanding
subpoenas,
which
is--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--what
follows
from
that
is,
particularly
in
this
case,
particularly
how
this
case
arose,
you
can
see
why
notice
is
important,
and
what
i
would
refer
to
is
this.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
i
understand
that.
what
i'm
saying
is,
donaldson
at
least
held
there
was
permissive
intervention.
permissive
intervention
as
applied
to
targets
in
this
case
is
a
complete
nullity.
it's
totally
illusory,
and
i'll
tell
you
what
happened
and
why,
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
had
in
mind.
when
we
were
at
the
district
court
level,
the
court
held
that
the
targets,
o'brien
and
magnuson,
had
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
to
challenge
the
subpoenas
issued
to
them,
magnuson
and
o'brien.
the
adequate
remedy
at
law
was
found
in
reisman.
the
adequate
remedy
consists
of
intervention
and
the
opportunity
to
challenge
on
any
recognized
grounds,
specifically
the
powell
grounds,
those
subpoenas.
after
the
court
handed
down
its
ruling,
the
sec
brought
no
subpoena
enforcement
action.
instead
what
happened
is,
many,
many
third
party
subpoenas
were
issued;
that
is
to
say,
subpoenas
issued
to
third
parties
seeking,
in
some
cases,
the
very
same
information,
in
other
cases,
to
the
extent
that
it
came
to
our
light,
other
or
additional
information
which
we
believe
were
not
legitimate
to
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
or
relevant;
and
in
the
process
of
doing
so,
avoided
the
opportunity,
prevented
us,
precluded
us,
preempted
us
from
the
opportunity
that
reisman
said
that
a
target
or
affected
person
would
have.
and
that
is,
the
opportunity
to
intervene
and
obtain
judicial
scrutiny
of
the
outstanding
subpoenas.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
sure.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
first
of
all,
in
this
case,
there
were...
at
least
to
our
knowledge...
over
60
third
party
subpoenas
served.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
the
reason
why
it's
not
adequate
protection...
and
i
may
be
begging
the
question,
if
i
understand
your
question...
the
reason
why
it's
not
adequate
protection
is
because
the
third
party
doesn't
have
any
incentive
whatever
to
disclose
to
the
target
the
fact
that
there's
an
outstanding
subpoena--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--but
not
all
third
parties
are
broker
or
dealers.
not
all
third
parties
are
persons
who
are
friendly
to
the
target,
and
therefore
would
not
have
the
incentive.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
i
agree.
if
the
sec,
in
the
course
of
conducting
an
informal
investigation,
chooses
not
to
issue
subpoenas,
it
can
talk
to
whomever
it
wants
and,
presumably,
about
whatever
it
wants,
even
if
that
information
they
seek
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
formal
order
of
investigation
which
is
issued
by
the
commission
to
the
staff
and
authorizes
them
to
proceed.
we
may
want
to
challenge
that.
that's
not
an
issue
before
this
court,
and
there's
no
practical
way
to
monitor
that.
what
the
congress
has
done,
however...
and
i
think
this
is
a
point
that
may
be
lost
on
this
argument,
at
least
so
far...
congress
has
specifically
placed
the
courts
between
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
the
course
of
issuing
subpoenas
and
the
enforcement
of
the
same,
by
not
allowing
those
subpoenas
to
be
self-enforcing
or
self-executing,
and
as
a
result,
has
put
the
courts
squarely
in
the
middle.
and
what
we're
asking
that
this
court
do
is
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
extent
that
they
held
that
a
logical
extension
of
reisman
is
to
provide
the
notice
necessary
to
allow
us
to
intervene.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
notice
is
to
give
them
the
names
and
identities
and
information
sought
as
to
all--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--that
would
be
true
only
in
part,
justice
marshall.
that
would
be
true
only
in
part.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
a
target
knows...
a
target
knows
who
he
is
doing
business
with,
yes.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
he
knows
the
sec
is
investigating
him.
however,
what
he
doesn't
know
is
the
subpoenas
and
summonses
that
are
issued
to
third
parties
who
are
not
business
associates
of
the
target.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
first
of
all,
if
all
the
subpoenas
were
lawfully
issued,
it
would
take
no
time.
secondly,
mechanically--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--that's
correct.
but
secondly,
the
presumption
is
that
if
notice
could
be
issued
to
the
target
at
the
same
time
as
the
outstanding
subpoena
is
issued
as
to
notice
form,
or
in
this
case,
a
copy
of
the
subpoena...
that's
all
that
would
be
required,
is
a
copy
of
the
subpoena
to
be
furnished
to
the
target
at
the
time
that
the
original
subpoena
is
issued.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
is
that
done
in
any
other
agency?
mr.
william
d.
symmes
the
argument
is
that
it
ought
to
be
done
by
any
agency
and
every
agency
who
is
similarly
positioned.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
the
answer
is,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
you
are
correct,
has
not
given
notice
for
the
last
30,
40,
50
years
of
its
existence.
that
is
correct.
but
that
doesn't
indicate
that
notice
should
not
be
given.
the
mere
fact
that
an
agency
historically
has
not
given
notice
as
a
matter
of
its
own
practice
or
custom
would
not
preclude
this
court
from
requiring
notice.
in
order
to--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--pardon
me?
mr.
william
d.
symmes
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
governmental
agency
that
would
give
the
type
of
information
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
must
be
given.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
we
agree
that
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
argument,
certainly
none
that's
been
made
here.
i
can
see
where
there
might
arguably
be
a
fifth
amendment
due
process
argument.
it
wasn't
made
to
the
trial
court,
it
wasn't
made
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
haven't
made
it
here.
there
is
no
specific
statutory
basis
for
the
notice
requirement.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
notice
should
be
given
as
part
of
its
reading
of
the
decision
in
reisman
and
as
part
of
its--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--except
to
the
extent
that
lower
courts
have
historically
applied,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
just
mentioned,
the
courts
have
historically
applied
the
decisions
like
reisman
and
powell
and
donaldson,
applying
to
the
irs...
they
have
traditionally
applied
those
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
think
the
commission
has
agreed
on
several
occasions
in
lower
courts,
specifically
in
that
pittsburgh
steel
case.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
pardon
me?
mr.
william
d.
symmes
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
respondents
here,
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
when
that
same
argument
was
made
to
the
ninth
circuit
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
that
no,
this
court
would
not
be
accused
or
guilty,
if
i
can
use
those
terms,
of
legislating
or
going
beyond
its
province
as
a
court.
the
reason
for
that,
simply,
is
that
there
already
exist
statutes
in
both
the
'33
act,
in
the
exchange
act
of
'34,
requiring
the
courts
to
get
involved
with
outstanding
subpoenas
issued
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
or
by
their
staff
more
properly,
in
the
event
that
a
target
or
a
recipient,
being
a
non-target,
voluntarily
refrains
from
complying.
and
under
those
circumstances,
this
would
be
simply
a
logical
extension
of
that
statute.
now,
counsel
has
indicated
in
the
course
of
his
argument
a
number
of
things
which
i
would
like
to
respond
to.
first
of
all
is...
and
perhaps
this
is
an
extension
of
the
question
which
justice
marshall
has
posed
to
me
earlier...
first
of
all,
the
question
is
why
are
we
entitled
to
notice
in
this
case,
and
specifically,
why
isn't
it
that
the
target
isn't
already
aware
and
won't
be
made
aware
from
his
business
associates
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
outstanding
subpoena?
i
can
think
of
one
reason
that
i
wrote
down
in
response
to
counsel's
argument
that
perhaps
i
should
have
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
argument,
and
that
is
this.
many
times,
the
target
isn't
even
aware,
as
was
true
in
this
case,
that
a
formal
order
of
investigation
had
been
issued
and
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
investigating
the
target.
the
second
thing,
i
think,
that
i
would
like
to
mention
is
that...
respond
to...
and
that
is,
notice
would
result
in
impediment
or
in
delay
in
the
normal
investigative
process
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
are
following.
i
would
respond
by
saying
several
things.
first
of
all,
delay
to
the
extent
you
may
call
that...
and
i
would
put
it
in
quotes...
a
certain
lapse
of
time
is
already
built
in
the
statutes
to
the
extent
that
if
someone
doesn't
comply
voluntarily
with
an
outstanding
subpoena,
the
commission
must
then
in
turn
bring
a
subpoena
enforcement
action
to
the
extent
that
there
is
delay.
secondly,
the
decision
in
reisman
involved
or
envisioned
some
delay.
i
think
the
proper
term
would
be
"lapse
of
time"
in
the
proper
case
where
an
affected
person
would
move
to
intervene.
next,
with
respect
to
the
abuse
issue,
i
think
that
the
courts
are
well-situated...
we
argued
this
in
our
brief,
and
i
won't
be
redundant
here...
the
courts
are
well-situated,
i
think,
to
handle
abuse
through
protective
orders
that
would
also
handle
the
privacy
issue,
through
contempt
citations,
through
certain
types
of
restraints
imposed
by
the
court
in
any
specific
case.
i
think
the
next
issue
that
i'd
like
to
respond
to
is
something
that
was
mentioned
in
the
brief,
not
mentioned
in
oral
argument
by
the
solicitor
general.
and
that
is
that
donaldson
somehow
created
a
civil
right
to
suppress
evidence,
information,
or
documents
wrongly
obtained
through
abusive
or
excessive
subpoenas
at
the
time
that
the
commission
choose
or
seek
to
choose
to
enforce
the
case
against
the
target.
and
i
would
just
simply
suggest
that
i
don't
see
that.
donaldson
doesn't
say
that.
donaldson
concerned
itself
with
a
criminal
case.
the
commission
argues
that
as
an
alternative
to
the
granting
of
notice.
now,
the
next
thing
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
this.
in
the
brief
of
o'brien...
and
i
think
it
was
also
alluded
to,
to
some
extent,
in
the
wedbush
brief
which
was
filed
as
an
amicus
brief
with
the
permission
of
this
court...
it
is
argued,
and
we
would
suggest
it
eminently
to
the
court,
that
although
the
ninth
circuit
case
basically
held
that
notice
should
be
given
in
all
cases,
there
is
a
lesser
position
that
this
court
could
take
and
still
grant
the
relief
which
the
respondents
now
seek
and
continue
to
seek,
and
that
is,
that
notice
is
not
something
you
are
entitled
to
in
all
cases,
but
notice
is
something
that
a
target
would
be
entitled
to
after
having
made
a
showing
of
some
evidence
that
there
are
subpoenas
being
issued
to
third
parties,
that
there
are
outstanding
subpoenas
that
we're
not
aware
of,
and
that
in
turn
some
showing
can
be
made
that
these
subpoenas
do
not
meet
or
exceed
powell
standards
to
the
extent,
as
in
this
case,
our
argument
basically
is,
and
we
believe
we've
made
that
showing
below...
certainly
we've
alleged
it
and
those
pleadings
are
deemed
true
before
this
court,
and
that
is
this:
that
in
the
case
of
the
legitimate
purpose
requirement
of
powell,
we
believe
we
have
and
can
make
a
showing
that
the
legitimate
purposes
behind
these
subpoenas
are
not
present.
at
lease
there's
no--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--but
it's
already
present.
that
tier
of
judicial
proceeding
is
already
present
right
now,
built
into
the
statutes
by
congress,
both
in
the
'33
act
and
in
the
'34
act.
we
are
entitled
as
a
target,
presuming
we
know
of
the
formal
order
investigation,
which
is
one
big
assumption
that
i
should
have
mentioned
to
justice
marshall,
that
you
cannot
make.
see,
the
commission
is
not
required
by
its
rules
to
give
a
copy
of
the
formal
order
of
investigation
authorizing
subpoenas
to
the
target.
there
are
subpoenas
outstanding
many
times
before
the
target
is
not
only
aware
of
the
subpoenas...
not
aware
of
the
subpoenas,
but
is
not
aware
of
the
order.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
it
would
be
a
separate
judicial
proceeding
before
the
same
court
on
the
issue
of
notice
alone,
which
as
the
ninth
circuit
mentioned,
could
be
handled
summarily
by
affidavits,
not
any
necessary
presence
there
by
counsel,
no
live
testimony.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
it
would
not
be
ex
parte.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
well,
im
not
sure
that
we
would
have
testimony.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
the
ninth
circuit
envisioned
when
it
made
this
requirement
of
notice,
the
ninth
circuit
envisioned
that
it
would
be
handled
by
affidavits,
that
if
there
were
a
controversy
amongst
the
affidavits,
that
there
could
be
argument.
but
at
no
time
was
it
envisioned
that
there
would
be
an
evidentiary
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
lower
courts
now
are
following
the
practice
of
not
awarding
or
allowing
evidentiary
hearings
unless
some
substantial
showing
is
made
that
there
is
violation
of
powell
standards.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
they
do
it
based
on
the
affidavits.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
targe
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
commission
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
what
if
they
disagree?
then
there's
argument
held.
in
order
for--
mr.
william
d.
symmes
--the
court
can
order
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
be
held
if,
based
on
the
affidavits
filed
by
the
target
who
is
moving
for
notice,
if
there
is
a
substantial
showing
or
at
least
some
substantial
evidence
showing
those
affidavits
that
there
is
a
violation
by
the
sec
of
the
powell
standards
which
govern
the
protectable
interests
of
the
target
in
having
investigation
concerning
him
being
conducted
lawfully.
if
there
is
some
showing
made,
at
that
point
the
district
court
could
order...
and
they
have
in
the
past
ordered
evidentiary
hearings...
limited,
short,
evidentiary
hearings.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
yes.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
first
of
all,
the
recipients
don't
have
the
incentive
to
challenge
an
excessive
subpoena.
for
example,
if
the
subpoena
is
served
on
the
recipient,
and
the
recipient
happens
to
be
a
broker-dealer
who
is
regulated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
whose
livelihood
depends
on
the
commission
and
their
compliance
with
commission
requests,
the
broker-dealer
has
really
no
incentive
or
interest
in
raising
the
powell
standards.
secondly,
the
broker-dealer
or
the
person
who
receives
the
subpoena
doesn't
usually
have
a
copy
of
the
formal
order
of
investigation
which
defines
the
scope
of
the
investigation,
or
if
they
do,
they're
not
in
a
position
and
don't
usually
have
the
time
or
would
take
the
time,
and
have
no
incentive
to
take
the
time
to
review
the
subpoenas
and
compare
them
to
the
formal
order
investigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
staff
is
conducting
the
investigation
through
issuance
of
process
within
or
without
the
authority
granted
it
by
the
commission
itself,
which
is
done
through
the
medium
of
the
formal
order.
and
for
at
least
those
two
reasons,
the
powell
standards
cannot
be
and
will
not,
as
a
practical
matter,
ever
be
met
if
we
leave
it
to
the
recipient.
mr.
william
d.
symmes
they're
not
likely
to
be
urged
on
the
court,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
most
people
who
are
the
recipients
of
such
subpoenas
are
not
in
a
position
to
do
so.
the
subpoena
itself,
the
form
itself,
is
so
strong...
fail
not
at
your
peril,
you
must
do
this...
subject
to
fines...
i
realize
the
courts
haven't
imposed
that...
but
the
subpoena
is
so
strong
and
so
demanding
and
so
official
that
even
if
a
recipient
might
be
inclined
to
do
so,
he
has
no
incentive
whatever
based
on
the
subpoena
alone.
so
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
powell
standards
could
only
be
met
a
target
having
the
opportunity
to
intervene,
and
only
by
intervention
can
he
assert
those
rights,
and
he
needs
notice
in
order
to
intervene.
and
that's
our
position.
and
i
think
that
what
we
must
not
forget
is
that
the
supreme
court
in
reisman
said
that
a
target,
one
affected
by
a
subpoena,
has
a
protectable
interest
in
not
having
information
or
documents
disclosed
or
revealed
by
a
third
party
in
response
to
a
subpoena
that's
not
lawful
or
issued
in
excess
or
abuse
of
statutory
authority,
or
thus
in
violation
of
the
powell
standards.
and
if
reisman
is
correct,
and
if
we
do
have
protectable
interest,
then
as
a
target
we
ought
to
be
able
to
intervene,
and
we
need
notice
to
intervene...
because,
as
i
pointed
out
in
this
case,
there
were
subpoenas
outstanding
and
being
responded
to
by
third
parties
before
magnuson
and
o'brien
were
ever
even
aware,
were
ever
even
aware
that
there
was
a
formal
order
investigation
or
any
investigation
of
any
kind
pending
against
them.
thank
you.
