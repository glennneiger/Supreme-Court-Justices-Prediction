unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
are
there
any
circumstances,
in
your
view,
in
which
the
target
of
an
investigation,
assuming
he
had
knowledge
of
it,
could
intervene
in
a
subpoena
enforcement
action
brought
against
a
third
party
recipient?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
the
powell
case
dealt
with
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
i
know
the
ninth
circuit
assumed...
i
guess
there
are
some
lower
court
cases
saying
it
applies
to
sec
investigations
as
well.
do
you
agree
with
that
view?
unknown
speaker
it
really
purports
to
be
mainly
a
construction
of
the
statute,
rather
than--
unknown
speaker
mr.
symmes,
didn't
donaldson
cut
back
on
both
reisman
and
powell?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
respond
to
the
solicitor
general's
point
that
if
donaldson
said
that
limited
permissive
intervention
was
permissible,
nothing
more,
after
kaplan
and
powell,
it's
a
fortiori
that
no
notice
is
required.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
if...
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
argument
is
that
if
donaldson
only
went
as
far
as
it
did
in
allowing
permissive
intervention,
a
requirement
of
notice
on
top
of
permitting
intervention
goes
even
further,
and
that
donaldson
would
have
had
to
go
further
as
to
intervention
before
you'd
even
think
about
notice.
unknown
speaker
what
follows
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
it's
important
doesn't
mean
it's
required.
that's
a
kind
of
house-that-jack-built
reasoning;
that
if
one
thing
is
good,
surely
another
thing
must
be
even
better.
but
we
don't
generally
decide
cases
that
way.
unknown
speaker
mr.
symmes,
can
i
interrupt
for
just
a
second?
unknown
speaker
how
could
that
really
preclude
you?
isn't
it
entirely
possible...
say
that
they
served
subpoenas
on
a
broker...
that
you
would
have
an
understanding
with
the
broker,
if
they
subpoenaed
your
records,
please
let
me
know,
and
that
the
broker
could
tell
you
voluntarily,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
might
all
call
you
up.
i
mean
you
might
well
do
business
only
with
people
who
are
willing
to
give
you
notice
if
there's
a
subpoena
like
this
served.
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
protection
for
most
third
party
relationships?
unknown
speaker
if
he
wants
to
retain
your
business,
i
don't
suppose
he's
going
to
be
too
happy
with
his...
too
popular
with
his
customers
if
he
doesn't
tell
them
about
things
like
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
who
are
unfriendly
might
well
respond
to
an
inquiry
without
a
subpoena.
and
you
get
no
notice
of
that.
unknown
speaker
the
notice
is
to
give
them
the
names
of
the
people
that
they're
doing
business
with.
unknown
speaker
the
names
of
the
people
they're
doing
business
with.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was,
don't
they
have
that
information?
don't
they
know
who
they're
doing
business
with?
sir?
unknown
speaker
and
he
knows
that
the
sec
is
investigating
him.
unknown
speaker
and
how
much
time
would
that
take
away
from
the
investigation,
to
try
out
each
one
with
the
targets?
you
say
you've
got
60,
this
one.
how
much
time
would
that
take?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
start
with
that
conclusion,
you
don't
have
any
problem.
unknown
speaker
is
that
done
in
any
other
agency
of
government?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
a
very
simple
one.
the
answer
is
no,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
other
federal
agency
in
government
gives
the
type
of
notice
that
you
want?
unknown
speaker
what
other
agency
in
the
united
states
government
gives
the
type
of
information
that
you
want?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
mr.
geller's
opening
argument
was
that...
what's
the
source
of
this
rule
of
law
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
announced?
what
is
your
view
of
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
was
a
construction
of
one
of
the
tax
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
so
in
the
sense
that
it
relies
on
statute,
that
case
really
doesn't
give
it
any
help
at
all.
i
mean
maybe
the
same
rule
should
apply...
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
we
be
accused
of
legislating?
unknown
speaker
when
we
don't
have
any
constitutional
backing
or
any
legislative
backing,
wouldn't
we
be
accused
of
legislating?
unknown
speaker
mr.
symmes,
that
would
just
add
another
tier
of
judicial
proceeding,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
a
separate
proceeding
whereby
your
client
could
go
into
court
and
make
a
showing
and
get
the
court
to
order
that
it
be
given
notice.
now,
i
take
it
that
wouldn't
be
the
substitute
for
the
proceeding
at
which,
after
receiving
notice,
you
might
seek
to
intervene
in
the
action.
so
don't
you
agree
that
would
be
a
separate
judicial
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be
ex
parte?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
affidavits
disagreed?
then
you'd
have
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
the
district
court
resolve
a
disagreement
if
affidavit--
unknown
speaker
--how
does
a
district
court
resolve
situation
where
both
party
opponents
submit
affidavits
that
directly
contradict
one
another?
you
say
they
are
doing
it
without
any
testimony.
now
do
they
resolve
those
questions?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
those
affidavits
disagree?
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
before
the
district
court...
the
lawyers
argue
as
to
which
affiance
should
be
believed?
that's
a
rather
unusual
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
mr.
symmes?
unknown
speaker
the
powell
standards
are
not
particularly
onerous,
the
need
to
prove
relevance
to
the
investigation
and
the
other
requirements.
and
i
assume
that
the
recipients
of
the
subpoenas
can
assert
meeting
the
powell
standards,
can
they
not?
what
tremendous
advantage
is
to
be
gained
by
making
this
rather
remarkable
extension
of
the
statute
to
protect
the
target?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
can
be
met.
your
argument
is
basically
that
they're
not
likely
to
be
urged
upon
the
court
by
the
recipient.
