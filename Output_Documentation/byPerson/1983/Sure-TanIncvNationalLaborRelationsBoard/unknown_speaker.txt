unknown
speaker
incidentally,
does
he
know
the
immigration
status
of
his
present
employees?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
is
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
employer
acted
solely
because
of
his
opposition
to
the
union
and
the
employees'
desire
to
have
a
union?
what
if
it
were
found
that
that
was
the
sole
reason
for
his
going
to
the
ins?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
in
the
abstract
that
that's
correct.
in
its
interaction
with
labor
relations,
isn't
the
board
entitled
to
draw
some
inferences
from
the
conduct?
unknown
speaker
it
did
so
here.
unknown
speaker
the
board
said,
in
effect,
all
right,
this
is
an
exercise
of
your
right
to
petition
the
government,
but
in
the
circumstances
in
which
you
exercised
that
right,
it
has
some
other
meaning
to
us.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
they
did?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
there
was
an
anti-union
motive
somewhere
in
this
set
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
now,
so
there
was...
the
employer
was
motivated
by
an
anti-union
bias,
i
take
it.
i
know...
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
case,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
there
was
that
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
sustained,
and
enforced.
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaherty,
are
you
sure
that
the
right
to
turn
in
aliens
to
the...
illegal
aliens
to
the
ins
can
be
equated
with
filing
a
lawsuit
in
state
court,
the
way
you
had
in
bill
johnson's,
for
constitutional
purposes?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
flaherty,
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
facts
here?
at
the
time
the
letter
was
written
that
you
have
exhibited
to
us
two
or
three
times,
your
client
didn't
know
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
he
listed
other
people
besides
these
who
were
not
in
fact
illegal
aliens.
unknown
speaker
so
he
really
didn't
know
which
were
and
which
were
not.
unknown
speaker
that
what?
unknown
speaker
some
of
them
were.
unknown
speaker
and
he
sort
of
just
tossed
a
bunch
over
and
said,
look
at
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaherty,
in
bill
johnson's,
is
it
possible
it
should
be
distinguished
because
there
the
employer
was
asserting,
trying
to
assert
in
state
court
an
alleged
injury
to
the
employer's
own
reputation?
the
employer
himself
had
suffered
an
injury
that
otherwise
would
not
be
redressed,
and
perhaps
that
is
not
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
opinion
also
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
employer
would
have
been
left
with
no
forum
in
which
to
pursue
a
remedy
for
an
actual
injury
to
the
employer.
does
that
distinguish
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
certainly
discussed
by
the
court,
and
apparently
relied
upon.
unknown
speaker
but
the
complaint
was
not
against
these
men.
it
was
against
the
union.
unknown
speaker
the
complaint
was
against
the
union.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
the
letter.
i
am
talking
about
sun-tan's
complaint.
it
only
came
about
when
the
union
tried
to
organize.
unknown
speaker
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
brought
it
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
the
letter
brought
on
by
the
election?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what...
it
came
after
the
election.
unknown
speaker
and
before
the
election,
everything
was
hunky-dory.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
board
and
the
lower
courts
drew
the
inference
from
the
factual
situation,
though,
that
he
was
animated
by
antiunion
animus
in
doing
this.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
we
don't
review
that
sort
of
thing
now.
unknown
speaker
what
have
lower
courts
done
in
the
labor
law
area
about
instances
where
an
employer
has
reported
an
employee
out
of
an
antiunion
animus
to
law
enforcement
officers
for
commission
of
a
crime?
maybe
it
is
theft,
or
assault,
or
whatever
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
may
be
in
this
court,
but
have
there
not
been
some
other
cases
below
in
the
dealing
with
reporting
of
criminal
violations?
you
are
not
aware
of
any,
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
issue
in
johnson?
was
it
the
issue
whether
the
board
could
enjoin
the
holding
of
the...
the
prosecution
of
the
suit,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaherty,
is
it
illegal
for
an
employer
to
hire
illegal
aliens?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
prevail
here,
then
isn't
a
way
to
avoid
the
confines
of
the
labor
act
just
to
keep
hiring
illegal
aliens,
and
when
one
gets
into
a
labor
bind,
report
them
to
the
ins?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
fired,
without
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice,
could
you
have
fired
the
illegal
aliens
for
the
reason
that
they
were
illegal
aliens?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
a
firing
for
cause
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
there
was
one?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
said,
if
there
was
one,
could
an
employer
fire
an
employee
because
he
is
an
illegal?
unknown
speaker
even
after
the
union
won
an
election?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
if
one
of
the
reasons
for
firing
a
person
is
that
he
is
an
illegal
alien,
and
another
reason
is
because
he
is
a
member
of
the
union,
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
definitely
not
what?
it
is
not
a--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
fortiori
in
this
case
if
you
are
right
in
my
example.
you
say
the
employer
could
even
fire
an
illegal
alien
himself.
he
doesn't
complain
to
the
government
at
all.
he
just
fires
him.
he
says,
you
are
an
illegal
alien,
you
are
fired,
but
by
the
way,
i
am
also
firing
you
because
you
are
a
member
of
the
union.
and
you
say
that
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
you
are
sort
of...
you
are
enforcing
the
law
yourself
then.
that
is...
the
employer
would
be
expelling
the
person
instead
of
having
the
ins
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
you
would
be
privileged
to
fire
them
without
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
there
was
not
an
antiunion
animus,
but
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
says
you
can't
fire
except
for
just
cause,
and
he
fires
a
bunch
of
employees
because
they
are
illegal
aliens.
you
say
he
has
that
privilege
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
that
law,
do
you
think?
may
you
fire?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
but
you
couldn't
fire
them
for
that
reason,
if
you
also
fire
them
for
being
a
member
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaherty,
may
i
ask
you
a
follow-up
on
justice
blackmun's
question?
unknown
speaker
you
responded
by
pointing
out
in
this
case
there
was
a
remedy
that
was
possible,
but
just
as
the
general
problem,
would
it
not
be
true
that
if
you
prevail,
an
employer
would
be
well
advised
to
hire
illegal
aliens
before
they
are
organized
and
let
them
know
promptly
that
if
they
do
organize,
they
will
be
reported;
if
they
don't
organize,
they
won't
be?
wouldn't
that
be
good...
it
seems
to
me
it
would
make
a
lot
of
sense
for
a
businessman
who
wants
to
have
inexpensive
unorganized
labor.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
fine.
i
don't
know.
but
isn't
that...
that
would
be
a
natural
consequence
of
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
result
for
which
you
are
arguing
would
encourage
the
employment
of
illegal
aliens
by
unorganized
employers.
that
much
is
clear,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
which
in
turn
might
encourage
more
illegal
aliens
to
come
to
the
country.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
we
should
encourage
the
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
the
result
for
which
you
are
arguing
i
think
you
have
acknowledged
would
encourage
the
practice.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
only
remedy
the
board
imposed
was
an
order
to
reinstate
once
the
company...
once
the
alien
is
back
in
the
country
legally?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
labor
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that
would
leave
a
remedy
standing,
a
remedy
which
is
premised
on
an
unfair
labor
practice.
you
say
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
in
this
very
case,
if
the
only
remedy
that
had
been
imposed
by
the
board
was
an
order
to
reinstate
once
the...
if
and
when
the
alien
is
back
in
the
country
legally,
now,
you
would
still
be
here,
i
take
it,
because
that
remedy
would
be...
the
predicate
for
that
remedy
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
was
the
fact
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
board
could
have
had
full
regard
for
the
labor
board...
for
the
immigration
laws,
and
you
still
would
be
here.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
what
i
am
asking
really
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
been
wrong
in
some
of
its
remedy
decisions,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
was
wrong
in
saying
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
making
two
different
arguments.
unknown
speaker
one,
that
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
because
of
the
board's
failure
to
integrate
it
with
the
immigration
laws,
and
second,
even
if
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
the
court
of
appeals'
substitution
of
a
remedy
was
improper--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
there
was
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
board,
under
the
board's
order,
wouldn't
the
tolling
of
back
pay
be
ended
if
the
alien
came
back
to
the
country
illegally,
and
was
available
for
work?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
under
the
terms
of
its
order,
the
alien
wouldn't
have
to
be
back
here
legally.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
object
to
the
alj's
four
weeks
back
pay
as
much
as
you
do
to
the
seventh
circuit's
longer
period,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
employer
communicate
with
them
on
the
job?
unknown
speaker
at
least
he
got
the
message
across.
unknown
speaker
on
this
question
about
the
spanish
letter,
there
were
about
a
dozen
employees,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
much
would
it
cost
to
translate
eleven...
translate
one
letter
to
eleven
people?
unknown
speaker
about
$1.25,
i
guess,
something
like
that.
we
are
talking
about
de
minimis.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kneedler--
unknown
speaker
--i
am
interested
to
know
whether
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
board's
result
here
can
be
defended
only
in
the
circumstances
of
the
immigration
laws.
let's
suppose
that
i
am
mr.
surak,
and
i
have
this
outfit
in
chicago,
and
an
effort
is
made
to
unionize
my
employees,
and
i
hire
a
private
investigator
to
find
out
what
i
can
get
on
the
people
who
are
leading
the
union
investigation
move.
i
find
that
one
of
them,
who
is
an
employee,
is
a
fugitive
from
indiana,
he
has
escaped
from
prison
in
indiana,
not
under
any
immigration
charge,
you
know,
on
an
armed
robbery
charge.
now,
the
reason
i
made
the
investigation
in
the
first
place
is,
i
want
to
hurt
the
union
if
i
can.
i
am
an
employer,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
unionized.
is
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
me
at
that
point
to
turn
him
in
to
illinois
authorities
to
be
extradited
to
indiana?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
obligation
of
the
employer
at
least
by
statute
and
case
law
is
much
the
same.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held,
hasn't
it,
that
the
employer
has
an
obligation
to
notify
the
ins
in
these
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
example
of
the
felon,
the
fugitive,
would
all
the
board
have
to
do
is
find
that
the
employer
wouldn't
have
fired
him
except
for
an
antiunion
animus,
and
wouldn't
have
turned
him
in
except
for
that?
is
that
all
they
have
to
find
to
find
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
he
testifies.
well,
why
did
you
turn
him
in?
i
turned
him
in
because
he
was
a
ringleader
in
this
movement
towards
the
union,
but
of
course,
and
when
i
found
out
he
was
a
felon,
i
could
easily
get
rid
of
him,
so
i
turned
him
in.
is
that
all
the
board
would
have
to
find?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
all
there
is.
unknown
speaker
what
is
abnormal
about
that?
unknown
speaker
so
the
policy
of
enforcing
the
laws
against
murder
or
something
are
stronger
than
enforcing
the
immigration
laws.
is
that
any
critical
part
of
your
submission,
that
the
interest
in
enforcing
the
immigration
laws
just
isn't
that
strong?
unknown
speaker
one
crime
is
different
than
another?
unknown
speaker
the
board
is
entitled
to
weigh
each
crime
and
make
final
decisions
for
the
whole
country
as
to
what
laws
ought
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--so
your
answer
is
yes,
it
does
make
a...
the
board
does
sit
to
decide
which
laws
are
to
be
ignored
and
which
are
not.
unknown
speaker
or
it
can
pick
out
the
immigration
laws
at
least,
you
say.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
sometimes
it
is
all
right
not
to
report
illegal
aliens?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
to
be
able
to
prove
he
loves
the
union
before
he
can
turn
an
illegal
alien
in?
unknown
speaker
let's
try
another
one.
he
knew
all
along,
for
20
years,
that
this
man
was
a
felon.
and
when
the
man
joined
the
union,
he
blew
the
whistle
on
him.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
could
support
your
position
by
saying
that
of
course
there
is
a
duty
to
report
illegal
activity,
there
is
a
civic
duty,
and
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
it
on
the
edges
of
that,
but
the
national
labor
relations
board
isn't
concerned
about
civic
duty
or
other
factors.
if
there
is
an
antiunion
animus,
that
supports
their
position
no
matter
what
the
other
considerations
are.
would
that
take
care
of
it?
unknown
speaker
even
where--
--right
across
the
board.
--indiana
felon,
too.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler?
unknown
speaker
in
the
example
you
have
been
discussing
for
the
last
five
minutes,
let's
assume
that
the
felon
who
escaped
from
illinois
or
wherever
it
was
was
sent
back
and
put
in
prison
for
four
years.
would
the
board
have
had
authority
to
demand
that
he
be
reinstated
at
the
end
of
the
four
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume,
as
i
think
justice
rehnquist
said,
in
reporting
this
fellow,
the
employer
said
quite
candidly
he
was
a
leader
of
this
antiunion
movement,
so
i
thought
i
had
better
report
him,
get
him
off
my
back.
unknown
speaker
the
board
would
have
to
reinstate
him
after?
unknown
speaker
if...
i
don't
quite
see
the
distinction.
why
wouldn't
the
board
not
only
require
the
re-employment
at
the
end
of
four
years,
but
also
compel
an
employer
to
send
him
six
months'
back
pay
to
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
encourage
people
to
report
crime,
would
it?
they
might
be
caught
in
the
middle
between
a
legal
obligation
to
report
it,
quite
apart
from
the
first
amendment,
and
what
you
say
the
board
might
feel
free
to
do.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
only
crime
to
which
your
argument
applies
is
where
one
employs
an
illegal
alien
and
then
discharges
him?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
principle
that
you
advocate
is
not
going
to
be
easy
to
carry.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
is
just
the
immigration
law.
i
think
it
is
the
whole
title
18.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
will
tell
me
exactly
what
was
the
violation
of
the
labor
law.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
that
apply
to
the
report
of
spitting
on
the
sidewalk?
unknown
speaker
or
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
nor
pennington
line
of
cases
generally?
certainly
there
have
been
other
competing
laws
involved
such
as
the
antitrust
laws,
and
it
has
been
claimed
that
companies
or
a
litigant
has
resorted
to
the
courts
deliberately
to
discourage
competition
or
to
get
them
out
of
business,
and
it
has
been
held
that
the
resort...
their
utilization
of
the
legal
processes
is
constitutionally
guaranteed.
unknown
speaker
what
about
california
transport,
or
whatever
that
was?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
the
constitutional
claim
is
there
is
just
no
constitutional
right,
protected
constitutional
right
to
report
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
it
wasn't...
the
employer's
reporting
may
have
had
an
indirect
effect
on
those
activities,
but
since
the
people...
the
activities
were
being
conducted
by
people
who
had
no
business
being
in
the
country,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
fault
the
employer
on
that
account.
and
it
was
the
government
that
expelled
the
people.
the
employer
didn't.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
another
question?
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
company
to
pay
six
months'
back
pay
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
former
employee
returned
legally
to
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
right.
well,
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
one
of
these
employees
called
up
the
employer
and
said,
i
am
now
back
in
the
united
states.
i
have
got
a
good
job
down
in
st.
louis.
will
you
send
me
that
six
months'
pay,
please?
and
the
employer
said,
well,
look,
are
you
lawfully
in
the
united
states
at
this
time?
and
the
fellow
said,
no.
he
said,
i
don't
have
to
be
lawfully
here
to
get
my
money.
could
the
employer
report
him
then?
and
not
pay
the
money?
i
guess
he
would
have
to
pay
it
under
the
court
of
appeals
order.
unknown
speaker
did
the
board
suggest
this
remedy,
or
was
it...
did
the
court
come
up
with
it
by
itself?
unknown
speaker
the
six
months.
unknown
speaker
who
brought
it
up
in
the
court
of
appeals,
anybody--
unknown
speaker
--sua
sponte?
and
are
you
defending
that
here?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily
isn't
it
the
board's
job,
not
the
courts,
to
specify
a
remedy?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
all
right
for
the
court
of
appeals
here
to
do
something
that
the
board
hadn't
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
defending
it,
you
said.
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
order
finally
entered
by
the
board?
unknown
speaker
is
that
often
done?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
order
back
pay
to
someone
who
isn't
available
for
work,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
here
is
somebody
out
of
the
country
who
can't
legally
enter.
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
to
order.
how
can
you
defend
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
remedies
are
not
supposed
to
be
punitive.
they
are
supposed
to
help
the
employee,
but
they
are
not
normally
extended
when
the
employee
is
unavailable
for
work.
it
just
seems
like
a
most
unusual
requirement.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
encourage,
as
justice
powell
suggested,
another
illegal
entry
to
come
and
see
about
the
money,
and
doesn't
that
fly
right
in
the
face
of
our
immigration
policies?
unknown
speaker
you
is
supposed
to
just
mail
it
to
him,
if
you've
got
his
address?
in
pesos?
unknown
speaker
that's
just
a
fine,
then,
for
violating
the
law,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
close
to
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
employer
ought
to
just
feel
lucky
that
it
was
confined
to
six
months.
unknown
speaker
because
the
employment
relation
hasn't
been
legally
terminated
yet.
and
back
pay
ought
to
run
forever.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
just
as
much
reason
for
running
it
a
year
as
six
months
on
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
hasn't
the
court...
hasn't
this
court
over
the
years
said
that
we
pay
great
deference
to
the
labor
board
provisions
for
remedy
and
things
of
that
kind
because
they
are
dealing
with
it
all
the
time,
and
they
develop
what
we
call
expertise?
what
expertise
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
in
these
areas?
unknown
speaker
about
the
same
as
ours,
wouldn't
it
be?
unknown
speaker
not
that
bad.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
all
appellate
courts
ought
to
leave
remedies,
the
devising
of
remedies
to
the
agency
that
is
very
experienced
and
can
understand
its
impact
on
the
whole
system
rather
than
just
one
aberration
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
there
is
legislation
pending
in
congress
to
make
it
illegal,
to
make
it
an
unlawful
act,
a
crime
to
hire
an
undocumented
alien.
suppose
that
legislation
passed.
would
the
board
or
anybody
else
be
entitled
to
make
a
remedy
that
would
give
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
not
if
they
pass
that
legislation.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
this
dichotomy
that
seems
to
be
interesting
everyone
about
the
employer
doing
the
noble,
patriotic,
and
altruistic
thing
in
reporting
these
illegal
aliens.
the
labor
board
historically
has
penalized
employers
or
unions
for
doing
good
things
if
they
were
in
violation
of
the
act.
hasn't
that
been
so?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
suppose
the
employer
on
the
day
before
christmas,
and
there
is
an
election
coming
up,
sends
a
caterer
out
with
a
complete
christmas
dinner
for
every
employee
and
maybe
a
case
of
scotch
along
with
it.
presumably
he
is
doing
a
good
christian
thing.
unknown
speaker
but
he
might
get
in
trouble
with
the
labor
board
for
doing
that,
might
he
not?
unknown
speaker
so
when
he
reports
the
criminal
conduct
of
these
employees
being
here
illegally,
he
is
doing
his
patriotic
and
civic
duty,
but
he
might
get
penalized
for
that
properly,
too.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
but
you
aren't
asking
for
all...
that
is
more
than
you
ask
for.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
depend
on
what
the
court
said
if
it
reversed,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
