mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
beginning,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
points.
one,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
board
held
that
the
employer
was
motivated
solely
by
antiunion
animus.
we
don't
view
that
as
an
essential
attribute
of
the
violation.
under
transportation
management
the
test
would
be
whether
the
employer
would
have
done
it
even
in
the
absence
of
the
antiunion
animus,
but
here
the
court
found
that
aggravated
circumstance.
and
secondly,
in
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits,
they
acknowledge
that
they
were
not
challenging
the
board's
finding
of
antiunion
animus
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
this
court
recognized
in
plyler
versus
doe
and
in
united
states
versus
brignoni-ponce
that
illegal
aliens
are
especially
vulnerable
to
exploitation
by
employers,
and
in
de
canas,
the
court
recognized
that
the
acceptance
by
illegal
aliens
of
jobs
on
substandard
conditions
has
the
effect
of
depressing
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
lawfully
resident
american
workers,
and
also
undermines
the
effectiveness
of
labor
unions.
we
submit
that
the
appropriate
accommodation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
immigration
laws
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
requires
a
recognition
of
those
realities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
would
present
much
different
considerations.
our
position
here
depends
not
just
on
a
construction
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
also
the
policies
with
respect
to
employment
that
are
reflected
in
the
other
federal
statute,
the
immigration
laws.
the
proper
accommodation
would
have
to
look
to
the
other
statute
that
the
employer
was
seeking
to
assist
in
the
enforcement
of,
and
for
instance
the
fact
that
it
was
a
felony,
a
serious
crime,
a
fugitive,
and
also
that
the...
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
particular
utility
of
this
device
to
employers,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
was
pointing
out,
the
utility
of
this
device
to
employers
to
avoid
the
policies
of
the
labor
act,
i
think
that
those
same
policies
would
not
be
present
with
respect
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what
the
ninth
circuit
suggested
in
the
passage
that
has
been
quoted
by
petitioners
is
really
that
it
is
not
the
board's
function
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
by
excluding
illegal
aliens
or
determining
the
documentation
of
illegal
aliens
and
excluding
them
from
board
protection,
that
the
employer
should
take
that
problem
to
the
immigration
service
if
that
is
his
point,
that
he
wants
to
help
enforce
the
immigration
laws.
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
purported
to
suggest
that
the
employer
should
have
an
absolute
immunity
from
his
obligations
under
the
labor
act
to
do
so
for
antiunion
reasons,
if
that
was
the
motivation.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
making
a
much
different
point,
that
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
is
essentially
the
responsibility
of
ins.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
is
ordinarily
what
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--again,
i
think
that
because
of
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
yes,
in
finding
the
normal
unfair
labor
practice,
that
is
true,
but
my
question
or
my
point
is
that
there
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
nothing,
if
one
looks
only
to
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws.
my
only
point
was
that
as
in
bill
johnson's,
the
court
sometimes
feels
that
it
must
look
outside
the
immigration...
or
outside
the
labor
act
to
see
whether
there
are
countervailing
considerations,
what
the
court
said
in
bill
johnson's.
it
might
preclude
the
board
from
finding
an
unfair
labor
practice,
even
when
the
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
certainly
the
department
of
justice
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
there
are
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
with
particular
reference
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
has
never
found
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
any
other
circumstances
insofar
as
i
am
aware,
where
an
employer
has
reported--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
is
not
the
board's
own
assessment
of
that.
this
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case,
that
there
are
countervailing
policies
reflected
in
the
immigration
act
that
reinforce
the
board's
construction
of
the
labor
act
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
absent
an
antiunion
animus,
and
really,
in
a
sense,
an
abuse
of
the
reporting
process,
it
would
ordinarily
be
entirely
appropriate
and
the
responsibility
of
an
employer
or
any
other
citizen
to
report.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
policies
of
the
immigration
laws
are
designed
to
protect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
the
initial
burden
is
on
the
board
to
establish
an
antiunion
animus.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
another...
again,
it
might
depend
on
the
application
of
misprision
of
felony
statutes,
which
is
another
consideration
that
would
apply
in
the
area
of
murder
or
any
other
felony.
it
is
a
federal
crime,
and
it
is,
i
would
assume,
a
crime
under
the
law
of
most
states
not
to
report
a
felony.
so,
if
we
are
talking
about
an
employer
who
has
knowledge
of
a
felon
in
his
employ,
that
countervailing
policy
and
the
legislative
judgment
reflected
in
the
statutes
about
reporting
a
felony
i
think
might
well
override
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
would
obviously...
i
mean,
that
would
control
this
case,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
so
we
are
not
urging
the
court
to
adopt
a
broad
rule
like
that.
we
are
narrowly...
we
are
eliminating
felonies
here.
the
only
crime
that
an
alien
who
enters
the
united
states
illegally
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
commits
is
a
misdemeanor.
i
don't
want
to
denigrate
the
fact
it
is
a
misdemeanor,
but
congress
has
ranked
the
offenses,
and
the
board
can
take
some
guidance
from
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
would
first
have
to
determine
whether
the
board
could
find
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
have
suggested
that
in
the
case
of
a
felony
or
a
murder,
a
crime
like
that,
that
the
board,
although
it
hasn't
addressed
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
am
suggesting
there
may
not
be
a
violation
in
those
circumstances,
so
the
question
of
reinstatement
would
never
be
reached,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
board
does
not
reach
the
question
of
remedy,
either
reinstatement
or
back
pay,
until
it
has
first
found
that
the
employer
has
violated
the
act,
and
in
the
situation
of
a
felon
and
the
employer's
reporting
of
a
felon,
if
the
board
did
not
find
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
suggested
that
the
employer
had
violated
the
labor
act,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
impose
a
remedy,
but
in
the
situation
where
the
board
does
find
a
violation
of
the
act,
as
here,
because
of
the
appropriate
accommodation
of
the
two
statutes
leads
to
that
result,
then
it
is
appropriate
for
the
board
to
consider
the
normal
remedies,
which
are
under
10(c)
of
the
act
reinstatement
with
or
without
back
pay,
and
then
at
that
point
the
board
would
determine
whether
reinstatement
and
back
pay
were
appropriate
in
light
of
the
policies
of
the
statute
that
the
employers
relied
upon.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
this
circumstance,
i
think
it
is
important
to
stress
the
narrowness
of
the
rule
we
are
suggesting.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
all
that
is
presented
here,
and
that
is
all
we
are
submitting
here.
i
don't
want--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are
affirmative
indications
in
the
purposes
and
background
of
the
immigration
laws
to
reinforce
that
conclusion
here,
purposes
that
i
would
think
would
be
absent
under
most
state
criminal
codes
in
the
commission
of
a
murder
or
something
like
that,
and
congress
has
enacted
two
statutes
here
that
have
to
be
given
due
consideration
by
the
board
and
the
court.
and
congress
fashioned
an
express
exemption
for
employment
of
illegal
aliens
insofar
as
employers
are
concerned.
it
did
that
at
the
same
time
it
was
strengthening,
it
said,
the
laws
against
illegal
immigration
into
the
united
states
by
enacting
a
prohibition
against
harboring,
but
congress
carved
out
employers
from
that
prohibition.
now,
obviously,
congress
did
not
expect
that
the
very
employers
who
would
take
advantage
of
that
immunity
would
turn
around
and
report
the
employers
immediately
upon
doing
so
and
thereby
sacrifice
whatever
advantage
they
had
acquired
by
hiring
the
illegal
aliens.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
in
the
immigration
laws,
there
is
the
affirmative...
there
is
the
affirmative
support
for
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
in
the
typical
title
18
offense,
i
would
think
you
could
not
find
that
support.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
sir.
in
this
case,
the
violation
of
the
labor
law
was
the
reporting
of
the
illegal
aliens
to
the
ins
in
retaliation
for
the
union
activities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
i
could
go
back,
in
a
cast
like...
let
me
go
back
to
bill
johnson's,
and
really,
what
petitioner
is
really
arguing
here
is
that
there
is
an
implied
exception
from
the
labor
laws
for
his
conduct
because
of
the
policy
favoring
reporting
of
crimes
and
the
policy
of
enforcing
the
immigration
laws,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
court
should
recognize
an
implied
exception
for
retaliatory
conduct
that
would
otherwise
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
that
requires
looking
to
the
competing
statute,
and
here
it
is
a
violation
because
the
policies
of
the
competing...
of
the
other
statute,
the
immigration
laws,
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
petitioners
do
rely
on
the
constitution.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
would
note
in
the
first
instance
that
they
did
not
raise
that
before
the
board,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here.
putting
that
objection
to
one
side,
i
think
again,
going
back
to
bill
johnson's,
the
distinctions
between
that
case
and
this
are
instructive.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
those
cases,
those
cases
have
involved,
as
in
nor
itself,
political
activity,
which
is
at
the
core
of
the
right
of
petition
political
activity--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
that
was
an
invocation
of
the
adjudicative
process
before
an
administrative
agency,
and
what
the
companies
were
doing
in
those
circumstances
fits
within
the
language
of
the
first
amendment
and
fits
within
this
court's
decision
in
bill
johnson.
they
were
petitioning
for
a
redress
of
their
grievances,
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
a
grievance
that
was
in
a
sense
redress
of
a
legal
injury
to
themselves.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
our
submission
does
not
go
that
far.
our
submission
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
it
is
not
an
absolute
right,
and
where
the
employer
does
it
in
retaliation
for
other
protected
activities
by
the
person
who
is
being
reported,
that
there
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
do
so.
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
employees'
activities
here,
even
while
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
also
have
constitutional
overtones.
the
right
of
association
and
to
organize
in
the
area
of
employment
are
also
constitutionally
protected.
so
the
employer's
reporting
of
the
violation
was
in
response
to
activities
that
also
have
constitutional
overtones.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
employer
brought
it
about,
and
concededly
in
this
court
did
so
for...
solely
for
antiunion
reasons,
and
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
right,
in
re
quarles
and
butler,
which
opposing
counsel
has
cited,
the
court
did
not
suggest
that
a
right
to
inform
about
violations
of
the
law
derives
from
the
first
amendment.
in
fact,
quarles
was
a
prosecution
under
section
241
of
title
18
for
a
conspiracy
to
interfere
with
rights
protected
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
what
was
involved
in
that
case
was
whether
the
federal
government
could
protect
its
own
processes
by
prosecuting
people
who
in
that
case
murdered
someone
who
informed
on
a
violation
of
federal
law.
and
so
the
very
essence
of
federal
sovereignty
was
involved
to
recognize
that
the
constitutional...
the
constitution
required
the
federal
government
to
protect
informants.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
a
minimum
six-month
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
unless
it
were
shown
that
the
employer
was
acting
for
some
antiunion
reason
under
the
court's
decision,
he
could,
and
i
am
not
sure
what
the
antiunion
reason
would
be
after
the
employee
had
long
since
left.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
board
has
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
board
had
not
ordered
it
in
its
decision.
the
alj
had
recommended
that
the
board
consider
some
minimum
award
of
back
pay.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
was
sua
sponte.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
are
in
this
case.
the
board
did
not
purport
to
adopt
a
general
policy
to
govern
all
such
cases,
but
it
did
accept
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct,
and
as
we
point
out--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
don't
suggest
that
it
is.
in
fact,
we--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
board
was...
in
this
particular
case,
the
board
was
willing
to
accept
the
suggestion
on
remand,
and
to
adopt
that,
so
as
far
as
the
six-month
back
pay,
that
is
the
board's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is...
well,
the
board
proposed
a
judgment
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
was
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
in
the
particular
case.
not
that
that
is
a
new
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
is
quite
unusual.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
employee's
unavailability
for
work
is
directly
attributable
to
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice,
and
under
the
board's
policies
where
the
employer
has
caused
the
employee's
unavailability
for
work
because
of
injury,
because
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
i
am
suggesting,
though,
is
that
even
where
the
employee
is
unavailable,
if
the
employer
is
responsible
for
causing
the
unavailability,
the
board
has
in
the
past
approved
the
award
of
back
pay,
and
here
the
employer
is
responsible
for
the
employee's
unavailability.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
alien
is,
too.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
award
of
the
back
pay
in
this
case
is
not
contingent
upon
the
alien's
re-entering
the
country.
the
back
pay
award
would
be
paid
to
the
alien
even
if
he
remained
in
mexico.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
not
a
fine--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't...
i
think
it's
quite
different
from
a
fine,
because
the
ordinary
remedy
in
an
unfair
labor
practice,
discriminatory
discharge
case
is
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
the
employment
relationship
between
the
employer,
and
the
employer
here
was
not
unlawful
insofar
as
federal
law
is
concerned.
the
alien
had
an
illegal
status,
but
the
employment
relationship
was
not
unlawful.
because
it
was
not,
then
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
immigration
laws
to
recognize
that
employment
relationship
and
apply
the
normal
back
pay
remedy
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
certainly
don't
suggest
back
pay
should
run
forever,
and
the
six-month
figure--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
at
some
point
the
amount
of
the
back
pay
might
become
so
substantial
that
concerns
about
its
being
punitive
rather
than
simply
remedial
might
be
raised,
and
indeed
six
months
may
be
toward
the
cuter
limit
of
the
amount
of
back
pay
that
should
be
awarded.
maybe
the
alj's
decision
as
a
general
rule
would
be
more
appropriate.
but
if
there
is
no
back
pay
awarded,
then
the
employer
has
really
no
financial
disincentive
to
evade
the
purposes
of
the
immigration
laws
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
generally
none,
and
as
i
suggested--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
board
is
the
expert
agency,
and
as
a
rule
the
matter
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
board.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
but
a
remedy
such
as
this
we
think
is
entirely
appropriate,
because,
again,
deferring
to
the
board's
expertise,
the
normal
rule
is
that
unless
there
is
some
effort
to
make
the
employee
whole,
the
purposes
of
the
act
will
not
be
effectuated
which
section
10(c)
requires.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
i
would
certainly
think
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
if
the
employment...
in
no
circumstances.
the
employment
relationship
would
then
become
illegal,
and
for
the
board
to
order
the
reinstatement
of
the
employee
to
an
illegal
relationship
and
to
pay
him
inconsistent
with
such
a
statute
would
clearly
be
improper,
but
as
i
said,
the
employment
relationship
is
not
illegal
under
the
immigration
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
that's
correct.
the
labor
act
does
attach
consequences
to
things
that
would
otherwise
be
entirely
lawful.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and
we
suggest
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
we
are
not
saying
everything
that
he...
every
report
he
makes,
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
think
that
that...
we
believe
that
that
is
entirely
appropriate.
i
would
like
to
address
bill
johnson's
and
the
first
amendment
issue
for
just
a
moment,
if
i
could.
the
first
amendment
by
its
terms
refers
to
petitioning
for
redress
of
grievances.
that
is
what
was
going
on
in
bill
johnson's,
because
the
employer
went
to
court
to
try
to
get
a
remedy
for
a
legal
injury.
that
is
not
this
case.
there
was
no
legal
injury
suffered
by
the
employer
here.
the
other
distinguishing
factor,
countervailing
consideration
in
bill
johnson's
was
the
deeply
rooted
interest
of
the
states
in
providing
a
remedy
for
wrongs.
that
is
not...
that
federalism
question
is
not
presented
here.
a
last
distinguishing
factor
is
that
the
employer
himself
knowingly
facilitated
the
employment
of
the
illegal
aliens
in
this
case.
it
does
not
come
with
good
grace,
i
submit,
for
the
employer
to
then
turn
around
and
rely
on
the
immigration
laws,
whose
violation
is
encouraged
as
a
basis
for
avoiding
liability
under
the
labor
laws.
this
is
not
the
first
occasion
in
which
these
concerns
have
been
raised,
even
with
this
employer.
this
employer
was
the
subject
of
prior
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
in
1973
in
which
the
board
then
found
that
except
for
a
few
senior
employees,
all
of
the
employer's
employees
were
mexican
nationals,
and
on
that
occasion
the
employer
again
had
intimidated
his
mexican
employees
by
making
it
clear
that
they
would
be
fired
and
he
would
hire
another
one
if
they
supported
the
union.
so
this
case
highlights
very
strongly
the
concerns
that
underlie
our
submission
here,
and
that
is
that
if,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
that
an
employer
would
have
a
powerful
incentive
and
weapon
to
hire
aliens
in
violation
of
the
immigration
laws
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
reversed
in
these
circumstances,
and
that
would
subvert
the
purposes
of
both
the
labor
laws
and
of
the
immigration
statutes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
was
referring
to
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
this
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case.
