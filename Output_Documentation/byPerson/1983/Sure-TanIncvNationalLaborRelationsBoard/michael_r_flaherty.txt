mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
is
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
employer
to
ask
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
investigate
the
immigration
status
of
its
employees?
that
is
the
first
and
the
most
important
issue
presented
in
this
case.
can
an
employer
be
required
to
pay
illegal
aliens
a
sum
of
money
equal
to
six
months'
pay
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
covering
a
period
of
time
when
the
illegal
aliens
are
not
present
in
this
country,
when
they
are
in
mexico,
and
they
are
not
lawfully
available
for
work?
that
is
the
second
issue
presented
in
this
case.
and
can
the
national
labor
relations
board
require
an
employer
to
write
reinstatement
offers
in
spanish
and
to
leave
them
open
for
a
period
of
four
years?
that
is
the
third
issue
presented
in
this
case.
the
operative
facts
in
this
case
begin
on
january
20th,
1977,
when
mr.
john
surak,
the
president
of
sure-tan,
wrote
this
letter
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
he
asked
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
investigate
the
immigration
status
of
his
employees.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
have
not
asked
mr.
surak
that,
and
so
i
just
cannot
answer
that
question.
in
response
to
this
letter,
the
ins
came
to
mr.
surak's
facility
and
investigated
the
immigration
status
of
the
employees,
and
in
response
to
this
letter
it
was
discovered
that
the
illegal
aliens...
that
the
employees
were
illegal
aliens,
five
of
the
eight
of
them
listed
on
this
letter.
they
were
immediately
arrested
by
the
ins,
and
they
were
permitted
to
execute
an
ins
form
whereby
they
acknowledged
their
illegal
presence
in
this
country,
and
then
they
voluntary
agreed
to
return
to
mexico.
the
union
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
employer,
and
the
labor
board
returned
a
complaint,
charging
that
sure-tan
violated
section
883
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
discharging
the
employees
when
it
sent
this
letter
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
in
an
attempt
to
resolve
this
dispute,
sure-tan
sent
letters
offering
reinstatement
to
the
employees.
they
were
written
in
english,
and
they
were
sent
on
march
29th,
1977.
they
asked
the
employees
to
report
to
work
by
may
1st,
1977,
if
they
accepted
the
offers
of
reinstatement.
in
the
proceedings
below,
the
labor
board
held
that
sure-tan
constructively
discharged
the
employees,
in
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
act
by
sending
this
letter
to
the
ins
requesting
the
ins
investigation.
the
board
ordered
sure-tan
to
offer
unconditional
reinstatement
to
the
aliens,
and
it
ordered
them
to
pay
them
back
pay.
in
response
to
this
order,
the
board's
own
general
counsel
filed
a
motion
for
clarification,
asking
the
board
just
what
it
meant
by
this
order.
the
general
counsel
observed
in
its
motion
for
clarification
that
an
order
that
required
unconditional
reinstatement
with
back
pay,
regardless
of
the
aliens'
immigration
status,
created
a
conflict
with
the
immigration
laws
and
policies.
it
in
effect
served
as
an
incentive
for
these
aliens
to
re-enter
the
country
illegally.
well,
the
board
denied
the
motion,
but
in
the
decision
denying
the
motion,
it
said
that
the
accrual
of
back
pay
should
be
tolled
during
the
period
of
time
when
the
illegal
aliens
were
unavailable
for
lawful
employment
in
this
country.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
order
with
certain
modifications.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
enforcement
decree,
the
illegal
aliens
would
have
to
be
reinstated
by
sure-tan
only
if
they
can
establish
at
the
time
they
present
themselves
for
employment
that
they
are
lawfully
available
for
work
in
this
country.
with
respect
to
the
back
pay
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
went
way
beyond
the
board.
it
invented
its
own
remedy,
or
so-called
remedy.
it
told
sure-tan
that
it
would
have
to
pay
each
of
these
illegal
aliens
a
minimum
of
six
months'
pay,
regardless
of
whether
they
were
lawfully
available
for
work
in
this
country.
this
was
on
the
theory
that
the
illegal
aliens
would
have
remained
in
this
country
illegally
for
some
period
of
time
but
for
this
request
sent
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
sure-tan
would
have
to
write
its
own
statement
letters
in
spanish,
and
it
would
have
to
leave
them
open
for
a
period
of
four
years.
the
most
important
issue
facing
this
court
in
this
case
is
whether
an
employer
can
be
held
liable
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
reporting
a
violation
of
the
law
to
the
immigration
authorities.
this
case
or
this
issue
has
already
been
decided
by
this
court
six
months
ago
in
the
bill
johnson's
case.
in
bill
johnson's,
an
employer...
or
employees
picketed
one
of
bill
johnson's
restaurants.
the
owner
of
that
one...
of
the
restaurant
told
the
employees
he
would
get
even
with
them
if
it
was
the
last
thing
he
did,
and
he
made
good
on
this
threat.
he
filed
a
civil
lawsuit
against
the
employees.
this
court
held
that
the
filing
of
a
civil
lawsuit
was
protected
under
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government,
regardless
of
the
employer's
motive
for
filing
that
lawsuit.
that
is
precisely
the
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
sure-tan's
request
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
was
squarely
within
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government,
just
as
was
the
lawsuit
filed
by
bill
johnson's
restaurants.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
if
that
were
found,
it
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor.
the
right
of
a
citizen
of
this
country
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law
is
not
conditioned
upon
the
person's
motive
for
reporting
that
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
certainly,
your
honor,
and
it
does
so
in
every
case
that
involves
motive.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
yes,
it
did
so
here.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
in
essence--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
is
what
they
did,
your
honor.
they
said
that,
yes,
you
have
a
first
amendment...
well,
they
did
not
address
this
directly,
but
assuming
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government,
which
certainly
there
is,
they
said,
we
are
going
to
condition
that
right
on
your
motive
for
exercising
that
constitutional
right,
and
never
before
has
this
court
ever
conditioned
the
right
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right
on
a
person's
motive
for
doing
so.
indeed,
if
this...
if
administrative
agencies--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--i
cannot
put
myself
in
mr.
surak's
head,
but
i
can
certainly
tell
you
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
union
and
the
company,
just
as
there
was
in
bill
johnson's
restaurant,
and
the--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--certainly
not,
and
he--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
was
found
below.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
and
that
is
not
relevant,
however,
with--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
is
not
relevant,
however,
with
respect
to
the
right
to
exercise
the
constitutional
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
very
definitely,
justice
rehnquist.
under
the
nor
pennington
doctrine,
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
many
cases
that
efforts
to
enforce
the
law,
whether
they
be
through
the
filing
of
lawsuits,
through
petitioning,
or
through
lobbying
to
seek
stricter
enforcement
of
the
law
by
law
enforcement
agencies,
or
other
petitions
to
the
government,
are
within
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government,
and
in
the
foro
precision
metal
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
that
precise
issue
was
addressed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
it
was
a
petition
to
the
police
by
ibm
for
them
to
enforce
the
law
that
led
to
the
indictment
of
14
people,
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
squarely
that
that
was
within
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
he
had
had
reports
several
months
earlier.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
he
had
received
reports--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
some
of
these
employees
were
present
illegally.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
and
also--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--he
had
asked
the
employees
after
the
election,
before
this
letter
was
written,
whether
they
were
present
legally,
and
a
number
of
them
said,
no,
they
weren't,
so
he
did
know
at
that
time.
at
the
time
he
wrote
the
letter,
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
the
holding
in
bill
johnson's
focused
on
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government,
and
it
said,
for
that
reason,
as
well
as--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government
stands
on
its
own,
and
that
this
court
recognized
that
in
bill
johnson's.
that
was
another
factor
that
was
present,
but
it
was
not
a
necessary
factor.
it
was
not
necessary
to
this
court's
decision
in
bill
johnson's--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--it
was
discussed.
it
was
relied
upon.
but
either
one
of
those
grounds,
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government
or
the
state's
compelling
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
public
peace
were
involved,
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
reporting
of
a
violation
of
the
law
is
just
as
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
the
public
peace
as
the
filing
of
a
civil
lawsuit
was
in
bill
johnson's.
if
anything,
the
right
to
report
a
violation
to
law
enforcement
agencies
is
more
important
to
the
public
peace.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
i
am
sorry?
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
no,
the
letter,
justice
marshall,
was--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--this
letter
was
written
after
the
union
won
the
election.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
this
petition
to
the
government
is
what
brought
on
this
case.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
i
can...
it
was
written
after
the
union
won
the
election.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that's
correct,
after
the
union
won
the
election.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
well,
before
the
election...
it
was
after
the
election
that
he
asked
the
employees
whether
they
were
legally
present
here,
and
they
admitted
that
they
were
illegally
present
here.
once
he
knew
that,
then
he
wrote
the
letter.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--no,
we
are
not
reviewing
that.
we
are
not
asking
for
that
fact
determination
to
be
reviewed
here.
that
determination
is
irrelevant
with
respect
to
the
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law.
in
the
quarles
case,
this
court
observed
that
a
person's
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law
to
law
enforcement
agencies
was
one
of
the
essential
privileges
and
immunities
which
arises
out
of
the
essential
character
of
our
form
of
government,
which
must
be
constitutionally
protected,
regardless
of
a
person's
motive
for
seeking
enforcement
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
justice
o'connor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
cases.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression,
to
my
knowledge,
in
this
situation.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
no.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that
is
correct,
and
it
was
alleged
that
the
suit
was
brought
in
retaliation
for
the
employees
exercising
their
concerted...
their
right
to
engage
in
concerted
protected
activities,
and
in
retaliation
for
their
having
filed
a
complaint,
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
presented
here.
it
is
alleged
that
sure-tan's
actions
were
undertaken
in
retaliation
for
these
employees
having
voted
in
a
union.
it
is
precisely
the
same
situation.
and
the
first
amendment
right
to
petition
the
government
that
was
present
in
bill
johnson's
is
just
as
present
here
as
well,
and
drawing
from
the
nor
pennington
line
of
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
law
is
privileged
under
the
first
amendment
regardless
of
why
the
actions
were
taken
to
enforce
the
law,
as
long
as
those
actions
were
not
a
sham.
and
in
bill
johnson's,
this
court
held
that
a
sham
would
mean
that
there
would
have
to
be
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
actions
taken.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
no,
it
is
not,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
your
honor,
in
this
case,
sure-tan
is
subject
to...
they
voted
in
the
union.
the
union
stayed
recognized.
it
has
to
bargain
with
the
union.
that
was
not
a
way
out
of
a
union
recognition
situation.
the
union
didn't
go
away.
it
stayed
there.
furthermore,
there
is
a
back
pay
and
reinstatement
liability
that
is
faced
here.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
for
the
reason
that
they
were
illegal
aliens,
certainly.
certainly.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
there
was
not
a
collective
bargaining--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
would
depend
upon
the
arbitration
case
law,
and
i
have
not
read
arbitration
cases
covering
that,
but
i
would
certainly
think
that
firing
an
illegal
alien
because
he
is
an
illegal
alien
would
be
just
cause.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
yes,
it
would.
yes,
i
definitely
think
it
would.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
definitely
not,
in
this
case.
he
had
a
right
to--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
this
case,
because
he
had
a
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law,
a
first
amendment
right.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
if
there
is
antiunion
animus?
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
i
would
say
no,
then
there
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
because
in
that
case
you
are
not
reporting
a
violation
of
the
law.
you
are
not
exercising
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
in
this
case,
you
are
exercising
a--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--well,
no,
in
this
case
the
enforcement
of
the
law
came
by
reporting
it
properly
to
the
law
enforcement
agency.
if
you
just
fired
them,
you
would
not
be
aiding
the
ins
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
you
did
not
mention
that
there
was
antiunion
animus
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
well,
interpretation
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
depends
upon
arbitration
case
law
and
the
past
history
of
the
parties
and
so
forth.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
i
definitely
think
that
they
could
fire
under
that
circumstance,
yes--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that
would
violate
the
labor
laws.
but
this
case
is
distinguishable,
quite
distinguishable
from
that
hypothetical,
because
in
our
situation
there
was
a
report
made
to
the
law
enforcement
agency
reporting
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
that,
as
this
court
held
in
the
quarles
case,
is
one
of
the
fundamental
privileges
and
immunities
of
all
citizens.
it
is
clearly
within
the
first
amendment
right
to--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--sure.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
well--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--regardless
of
how
this
court
holds,
your
honor,
it
is
a
possible
consequence,
yes,
but
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
to
report
a
crime
to
the
law
enforcement
agency,
that
would
not
end
this
problem
at
all.
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
employers
would
make
a
telephone
call
rather
than
write
a
letter.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
it
is
a
possible
consequence.
it
is
not
an
essential
consequence.
employers...
people--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--people
hire
illegal
aliens
for
a
number
of
reasons,
whether
it
be
to
perform
work
that
other
people
don't
want
to
do
because
they
work
for
less
money.
there
are
a
large
number
of
reasons
why
people
hire
illegal
aliens.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
certainly
not
and
i
am
not
saying
that
this
court
would--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--it
is
possible.
it
is
possible.
with
respect
to
the...
well,
there
is
also
a
fundamental
conflict
in
this
case
with
the
immigration
laws
presented
by
the
board's
order.
in
effect,
the
board
is
holding
sure-tan
liable
under
the
labor
laws
for
assisting
in
the
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws.
now,
this
just
cannot
be.
you
cannot
be
held
liable
under
one
set
of
laws
for
helping
enforce
other
laws,
and
this
court
noted
in
the
southern
steamship
case
that
the
labor
laws
have
to
be
interpreted
and
enforced
in
consonance
with
the
immigration
laws,
and
to
hold
someone
liable
under
one
law
for
enforcing
another
violates
the
southern
steamship
mandate.
now,
with
regard
to
the
back
pay
award,
as
we
have
argued,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
exercising
the
constitutional
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law.
there
should
be
no
back
pay
award.
but
under
any
circumstance,
the
award
of
back
pay,
six
months'
pay
to
illegal
aliens
covering
a
period
of
time
when
they
are
not
lawfully
available
for
work
in
this
country
is
wholly
inappropriate.
the
board
itself
acknowledged
that
this
was
improper.
they
would
have
tolled
the
accrual
of
back
pay
during
the
time
that
the
illegal
aliens
were
not
available
for
employment,
because
they
were
in
forced
absence
from
this
country.
yet
the
court
of
appeals
invented
its
own
remedy.
it
came
up
with
a
six-month
back
pay...
essentially
what
was
a
fine
that
was
imposed
on
sure-tan.
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
this
six-month
back
pay
award.
it
is
based
on
pure
speculation,
and
as
judge
wood
noted
in
his
dissent,
the
rationale
behind
this
back
pay
award
seems
to
be
to
punish
sure-tan
for
what
it
did.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that
would
comport
with
immigration
laws,
certainly.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that
would
comport
with
the
labor
laws
as
well.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
well,
assuming,
contrary
to
fact,
that
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
a
remedy
that
would--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--that's
right.
certainly
we
feel
that
there
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
and
there
should
be
no
remedy.
there
is
no
need
for
a
remedy.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
if
they
had
full
regard
for
the
immigration
laws,
then
they
would
not
have...
first
of
all,
they
would
not
have
imposed
back
pay
for
a
period
of
time
when
they
were
not
lawfully
available
for
work.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
oh,
i
certainly
think
they
were
wrong
in
saying
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
yes,
i
am
making
two
different
arguments.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
that's
correct.
assuming
arguendo
there
was
a
violation,
then
the
remedy
was
clearly
erroneous.
there
should
not
have
been
an
imposition
of
an
arbitrary
six-month
back
pay
award
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
illegal
aliens
weren't
available
for
work,
because
the
board
under
its
normal
procedures
would
toll
back
pay.
indeed,
that's
what
it
wanted
to
do
in
its
decision
denying
the
motion
for
clarification.
it
said
back
pay
should
be
tolled
when
the
illegal
aliens
are
not
available
for
work,
and
certainly
the
illegal
aliens
should
not
be--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--i
would
certainly
hope
so.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
well,
i
think
if
they
are
not
lawfully
available
for
work
is
how
i
interpret
that.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
but
i
think
certainly
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
in
what
they
advised,
it
should
be
construed
that
way.
otherwise,
they
would
have
an
incentive
to
come
here
illegally
in
order
to
prevent
the
tolling
of
back
pay,
so
they
could
keep
the
meter
running
by
being
here
illegally,
and
that
certainly
would
conflict
with
the
immigration
laws.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
definitely.
in
essence,
what
it
does
it,
is
conflicts
with
immigration
laws.
it
treats
them
as
though
they
had
a
legal
right
to
remain
here
for
four
weeks
or
six
months
even
though
they
were
not
lawfully
here
to
begin
with,
and
they
were
returned
to
mexico.
in
essence,
any
back
pay
covering
a
period
of
time
when
they
were
not
available
for
work
treats
the
immigration
laws
as
if
they
were
of
no
consequence,
and
that
type
of
a
conflict
with
the
immigration
laws
violates
this
court's
mandate
in
southern
steamship
that
the
remedies
of
the
board
have
to
comport
with
other
fundamental
congressional
objectives,
those
in
the
immigration
laws.
with
respect
to
the
reinstatement
offers,
never
before
has
the
board
required
an
employer
to
communicate
with
its
employees
in
a
foreign
language,
and
yet
in
this
case
it
tells
sure-tan
that
it
has
to
communicate
in
writing
with
these
employees
in
spanish.
it
has
to
hire
an
interpreter
to
talk
to
these
people.
the
government
is
not
even
required
to
communicate
with
its
citizens
in
a
foreign
language.
it
is
just
fundamentally
unfair
and
wrong
to
require
a
private
employer
to
communicate
with
employees
in
spanish
when
the
government
isn't
even
required
to
do
so.
in
fact,
there
are
board
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--by
attempts
to...
a
combination
of,
i
believe,
english
and
spanish.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
he
got
the
message
across.
pointing,
and
i
really
can't
say,
because
i
wasn't
there,
but
it
was
a
rather
primitive
communication,
i
would
imagine.
with
respect
to
the
four-year
reinstatement
offer,
never
before
has
the
board
required
that
reinstatement
offers
be
left
open
for
a
period
of
four
years.
traditionally
the
board
has
upheld
reinstatement
offers
that
have
been
held
open
for--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--there
were
eleven
employees,
five
of
whom
were--
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
--i
couldn't
speak
to
that.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
the
courts
have
held
and
our
brief
points
out
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
government
is
not
required
to
communicate
in
a
foreign
language
with
its
citizens,
and
yet
the
board
would
require...
impose
that
upon
sure-tan,
contrary
to
its
prior
cases.
it
changes
its
own
precedent,
without
any
warning.
and
with
regard
to
the
four-year
reinstatement,
that
also
is
contrary
to
established
precedent.
in
conclusion,
this
case
presents
the
exact
same
issue
that
was
presented
to
this
court
in
bill
johnson's
restaurant.
as
this
court
decided
in
bill
johnson's
restaurant,
it
should
hold
that
sure-tan
had
a
constitutional
right
to
report
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
that
it
did
not
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
doing
so.
mr.
michael
r.
flaherty
thank
you.
