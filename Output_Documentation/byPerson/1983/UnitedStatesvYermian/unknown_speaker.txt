unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
right
there,
what
about
the
work
sheet?
was
that
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
so
the
work
sheet
would
be
part
of
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
have
indicted
him
on
the
basis
of
the
work
sheet?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
employer
had
just
forwarded
the
work
sheet
without
having
the
supplemental
document
which
had
on
its
face
the
evidence
about
the
security
clearance?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
had
none.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
had
none,
to
get
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
was.
that's
precisely
the
information
the
government
wanted,
and
they
just
didn't
disclose
to
the
employee
that
they
were
making
a
security
clearance.
unknown
speaker
without
telling
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
employee
could
be
liable
under
the
statute
without
having
any
knowledge
of
federal
involvement?
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
does
the
government
agree
that
the
shifting
of
the
language
in
the
1948
revision
was
not
intended
to
achieve
any
substantive
result?
unknown
speaker
before
'48
the
language
wasn't
quite
as
favorable
to
this
particular
part
of
your
argument
as
it
is
now.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
cases
in
which
a
defendant
has
been
held
criminally
liable
without
having
any
knowledge
that
what
he
was
doing
might
be
a
crime?
i'm
thinking
of
a
case,
mike
royko
had
a
column
in
the
chicago
tribune
about
lying
to
people
when
they
come
out
in
the
exit
polls.
supposing
an
fbi
agent
were
investigating
election
frauds
and
didn't
tell
the
people
he
questioned
coming
out
of
the
polls
that
he
was
doing
that,
and
somebody
lied
to
him.
under
your
view
it
would
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
deliberate
lie,
i'm
assuming,
a
deliberate
misstatement
of
how
a
person
voted.
or
maybe
an
fbi
agent
comes
up
to
somebody
at
the
bar
without
telling
him
he's
an
fbi
agent,
he
engages
him
in
a
conversation,
the
man
lies
to
him.
unknown
speaker
but
the
real
question,
does
it
require
knowledge
of
anything
other
than
willful
falsity?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume
fbi
agents
frequently
interrogate
people
without
disclosing
their
identity,
and
they're
engaged
in
very
important
federal
work.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
those
hypotheticals,
with
your
view
on
those
hypotheticals.
but
if
the
neighbor
were
actually
an
fbi
agent
in
each
of
those
cases,
then
you'd
be
committing
a
crime
without
having
any
knowledge
that
you
were
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
willfulness
other
than
knowing
falsity?
that's
the
only
willfulness
requirement
i
understand
you
to
contend
there
is.
unknown
speaker
how
about
an
application
for
employment
form
without
knowing...
assume
the
government
required
all
employment
application
forms
to
be
screened
for
security
purposes
at
some
defense
plant
or
something,
without
telling
the
people.
would
every
person
who
filled
out,
made
a
false
statement
on
an
application
form
be
committing
a
crime?
i
think
he
would.
unknown
speaker
but
ms.
corwin,
doesn't
everyone
know
that
assaulting
someone
is
going
to
be
a
criminal
offense?
and
i
suppose
not
everyone
knows
that
lying
about
his
age,
for
instance,
might
be
a
federal
offense.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
corwin,
in
this
particular
case
i
suppose
that
the
evidence
available
here,
the
document
in
question
which
was
signed
by
the
respondent
here,
is
evidence
of
knowledge,
and
so
if
knowledge
is
required
presumably
the
government
could
go
to
trial
with
the
same
proof
it
had.
we're
here
because
of
an
instruction,
are
we
not,
where
the
court
said
having
reason
to
know
was
enough?
but
there
was
actually
evidence
that
i
would
assume
would
take
you
to
the
jury
on
actual
knowledge,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
another
example
you
suggested
on
page
30
of
your
brief,
on
the
information
gathering
function
in
connection
with
the
nra
in
the
hot
oil
cases,
where
you
mention
that
people
might
send
information
in
to
the
central
information
gatherer,
who
in
turn
would
forward
it
to
the
government,
and
they
would
not
know
it
was
going
to
be
used
for
a
government
purpose.
isn't
it
entirely
possible
in
those
situations
that
members
of
the
trade
associations,
not
wanting
to
be
entirely
candid
to
their
competitors,
might
misstate
facts,
which
could
constitute
a
violation
without
any
knowledge
that
they
were
running
that
risk?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
particular
case
that's
right.
but
as
you
point
out
in
your
brief,
there
are
situations
where
false
statements
to
such
private
groups
can
be
made
without
realizing
the
ultimate
purpose.
and
trade
associations,
of
course,
are
a
classic
example.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
businessman
had
no
knowledge
that
there
would
be
any
federal
use
of
the
information?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
agree
with
you
in
that
particular
program
that
people
should
have
been
aware
they
were
violating
some
state
rules,
if
not
the
federal
rule.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
there
are
information
gathering
programs
where
you
use
trade
associations
to
gather
the
information,
and
the
individual
supplier
of
the
information
may
not
have
any
knowledge
that
the
federal
government
might
use
it
and
might
intend
to
deceive
his
competitors,
because
he's
not
living
up
to
some
price-fixing
agreement
or
something
of
that
kind.
he'd
be
a
criminal.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
to
prove
two
things:
federal
involvement
and
knowledge
of
falsity.
those
are
the
two
elements.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
an
answer
to
that,
that
it's
none
of
the
government's
business
how
a
person
votes,
and
it
washes
out
all
of
mr.
royko's
concerns?
how
could
it
conceivably
be
any
of
the
government's
business
under
any
circumstances
how
a
person
voted?
unknown
speaker
what
would
that
do
to
our
traditional
secrecy
of
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
defendant
be
protected
in
your
example
by
the
requirement
of
materiality?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hillman,
the
government's
cert
petition
does
not
raise
a
question
about
the
form
of
the
instruction
as
i
read
it.
the
only
question
is
whether
there's
any
need
for
federal
involvement,
as
i
read
the...
the
only
question
presented
by
the
cert
petition.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
didn't
preserve
that
question,
is
all
i'm
saying.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
seeking
reversal.
the
history
of
the
statute
is
convoluted,
but
there
is
a
clear
thread
woven
into
the
statute
from
it's
original
antecedent
through
the
1948
recodification,
and
that
thread
is
the
requirement
that
a
person
know
of
federal
involvement.
since
the
1948
amendment
itself
was
non-substantive,
as
the
court
has
recognized,
it
is
necessary
to
focus
on
the
1934
legislative
process
and
intent
of
congress
in
1934.
significantly,
the
first
bill
that
was
submitted
to
congress
in
1934
contained
language
of
specific
intent
to
defraud
the
government.
that
first
bill,
of
course,
was
vetoed,
but
it
was
vetoed
because
it
failed
to
reach
further
than
the
existing
1918
statute
and
to
reach
the
concerns
expressed
by
the
court
in
united
states
versus
cohn.
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
the
first
bill
was
not
vetoed
because
it
contained
language
of
specific
intent
to
defraud.
in
the
second
bill,
the
one
that
was
finally
enacted,
the
"in
any
matter"
language
first
appears.
the
government
well
understands
that
the
vetoed
bill
required
the
specific
intent
to
defraud,
but
nevertheless
the
government
argues
that
the
new
language,
the
1863.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
veto
language,
nor
in
the
remarks
of
congress,
nor
in
the
experience
of
congress
as
of
1934
that
would
have
led
congress
to
abandon
the
long-standing
knowledge
requirement.
on
the
contrary,
it
appears
from
the
sparse
legislative
history
that
congress
finally
recognized
the
problem
created
in
the
cohn
type
situation
and
the
problem
inherent
in
the
1918
statute
and
that
congress
therefore
inserted
the
new
phrase
to
encompass
non-monetary
deceptions
of
newly
created
federal
programs.
it's
interesting
to
note,
i
think,
that
in
1948
what
had
been
section
35
of
the
criminal
code
was
brought
within
the
penumbra
of
the
1000
section
of
title
18,
and
it
was
in
1948
that
section
35
became
section
1001.
and
in
doing
so,
congress
incorporated
our
statute
into
the
broader
statutory
scheme
which
was
contained
in
1001
through
1016.
i
think
it's
noteworthy
that
in
this
broad
scheme
all
of
the
other
false
statement
statutes
either
on
their
face
require
a
specific
intent
to
defraud,
such
as
1005,
which
prohibits
false
entries
in
bank
books
with
the
intent
to
defraud...
that
is
the
specific
language...
or
in
1004
or
1011,
the
status,
the
very
status
or
position
of
the
covered
personnel,
such
as
a
bank
officer
or
a
mortgagee,
gives
adequate
notice
to
the
person
that
he
is
dealing
with
the
government.
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
1001
is
accepted,
it
would
appear
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
these
specific
statutes,
because
the
government
could
always
resort
to
section
1001
and
thereby
circumvent
the
specific
statutes
which
either
require
specific
intent
on
their
face
or
give
notice
to
the
defendant
by
his
very
status
that
he
is
dealing
with
the
government.
the
government
goes
on
to
argue
that
the
social
and
political
context
of
the
new
deal,
the
background
as
they
call
it,
indicate
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
delete
the
long-standing
requirement
of
jurisdictional
knowledge
from
the
1934
statute.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
record
of
such
concerns
in
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever
of
this
concern
in
president
roosevelt's
veto
language.
and
i
would
contend
that
if
those
had
been
the
concerns
of
congress
they
would
have
been...
they
would
have
shown
up
in
the
first
bill.
that
is,
if
these
had
been
the
concerns
of
congress,
the
first
bill
would
not
have
contained
the
specific
language
that
it
did,
the
language
of
intent
to
defraud.
although
congress
concededly
was
concerned
about
the
integrity
of
all
federal
programs
and
the
newly
created
federal
programs,
congress
in
our
view
had
no
reason
to
address
a
person
such
as
that
of
respondent
who
had
no
knowledge
of
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
what
shows
that
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
intermediary
cases,
statements
made
to
an
intermediary
where
there
is
knowledge
of
the
federal
destination
of
the
statement,
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases
cited
in
both
briefs
arose
in
the
1960's
and
'70's,
as
the
government
delegated
more
responsibility
to
the
states
and
to
private
industry.
there
simply
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
even
aware
of
such
a
problem
in
1934.
turning
to
the
feola
case,
we
contend
that
section
1001
is
fundamentally
different
from
section
1011,
the
federal
assault
statute.
if
the
government
is
correct,
then
1001
could
be
used
to
punish
persons
who
make
private
statements,
statement
which,
unlike
assault,
no
state
law
may
proscribe,
which
are
not
fraudulent...
and
which
are
not
fraudulent
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
the
government
does
not
acknowledge
that
there
are
situations
where
the
making
of
a
private
false
statement
and
federal
agency
jurisdiction
are
contemporaneous.
could
i...
could
you
tell
me
where
you
made
the...
you
requested
the
instruction
that
you
think
should
have
been
given
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
39?
unknown
speaker
49.
and
you
think
it's
enough,
you
think
it's
enough
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
statement
is
made
in
connection
with
something
that
has
a
federal
involvement?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
agree
that
if
you
have
a
knock
on
your
door
at
home
and
the
gentleman
there
identifies
himself
as
an
fbi
agent,
saying
he's
investigating
a
murder
in
the
neighborhood
or
something...
does
it
violate
1001
for
you
to
lie
to
him?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
you
really
need
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
is
just
some
knowledge
that
that
statement
is
relevant
to
some
official
business
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hillman,
you
don't
want
to
concede
any
other
people's
cases,
do
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't...
didn't
you
request
an
instruction
that
the
government
had
to
prove
an
intent
to
defraud
the
government?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
request
an
instruction
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
this
man
knew
he
was
lying,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
what
this
argument's
going
to
help
him.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
this
argument
helps
that
point.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it's
admitted
he
deliberately
lied
and
meant
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
ordinarily
that
isn't
the
case,
ms.
corwin.
willfulness
goes
to
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person,
and
the
element
of
reliance
in
your
civil
fraud
action
is
quite
different
than
the
element
of
willfulness.
unknown
speaker
let's
just
look
at
the
question.
it
says:
"whether,
in
a
prosecution,
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
statement
was
made
in
a
federal
matter.
"
how
does
that
raise
the
instruction
question?
