ms.
carolyn
corwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
question
of
what
elements
the
government
must
prove
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1001,
the
federal
false
statements
statute.
respondent
in
this
case
filled
out
a
form
in
connection
with
a
security
clearance
process
required
by
the
department
of
defense.
respondent
had
been
hired
as
an
engineer
by
a
company
that
was
a
defense
contractor.
in
order
to
work
on
certain
projects,
it
was
necessary
that
he
be
investigated
and
that
he
receive
a
government
security
clearance.
for
that
purpose,
respondent's
employer
gave
him
a
work
sheet
to
fill
out.
on
that
work
sheet,
respondent
indicated
that
he
had
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
he
listed
the
employers
for
whom
he
had
worked
in
the
past.
respondent's
employer
transcribed
that
information
onto
another
form
entitled
"department
of
defense
personnel
security
questionnaire.
"
respondent
signed
that
form
and
it
was
mailed
to
the
department
of
defense.
subsequently,
the
fbi
discovered
that
in
fact
respondent
had
been
convicted
of
mail
fraud
and
that
two
of
the
employers
that
he
had
listed
on
his
form
in
fact
had
never
employed
respondent.
on
the
basis
of
those
false
statements,
respondent
was
indicted
and
convicted
for
violations
of
section
1001.
at
trial
respondent's
sole
defense
was
that
he
had
not
realized
that
the
false
information
he
provided
would
be
forwarded
to
the
federal
government.
both
sides
in
this
case
agree
that
the
government
must
establish
certain
elements
in
order
to
make
out
a
violation
of
section
1001.
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant's
statements
were
false
and
that
he
knew
it
at
the
time.
respondent
acknowledges
here
that
his
statements
were
false
and
that
he
knew
that
when
he
filled
out
and
signed
the
form.
both
sides
also
agree
that
the
government
must
establish
that
a
defendant
made
his
statement
in
a
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction.
respondent
agrees
with
us
that
his
false
statements
were
made
in
such
a
matter,
since
the
government
security
clearance
process
is
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
defense.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
the
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
was
the
entire
security
clearance
process.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
work
sheet
was
part
of
that
process,
and
it
was
really
a
preparation
for
the
final
sheet
that
was
typed
up
and
sent
in.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
that
depends
on
whether
the
security
clearance
process
worked
its
way
through.
i
suppose
if
the
work
sheet
had
been
filled
out
and
it
had
been
decided
never
to
proceed
with
the
process
that
it
wouldn't
have
been
in
a
matter.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
would
note
preliminarily
that
the
work
sheet
did
have
some
indications
that
it--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--was
a
government
document
on
it.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
if
it
hadn't
had
anything
on
it,
i
think
it
would...
and
it
were
forwarded,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
information
initially
had
been
requested
in
connection
with
the
government
security
clearance.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
if
the
employer
had
requested
the
information
and
requested
that
the
work
sheet
be
filled
out
for
the
purpose
of
forwarding
it
to
the
department
of
defense,
it
would
be--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--that's
correct.
it
would
be
in
a
matter
within
federal
jurisdiction,
regardless
of
what
was
said.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
yes,
that
is
our
position,
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
government
prove
knowledge
of
federal
involvement
in
a
case
like
this.
that
is
precisely
the
point
on
which
the
parties
disagree
in
this
case,
whether
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
there
was
federal
involvement
when
he
makes
a
false
statement.
three
court
of
appeals,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
and
the
seventh
circuits,
have
held
that
such
proof
is
not
an
element
of
a
section
1001
offense.
the
ninth
circuit
here
held
that
the
government
is
required
to
prove
knowledge
of
federal
involvement.
now,
this
question
is
similar
to
one
that
many
federal
courts
have
confronted
in
the
context
of
a
number
of
different
federal
statutes.
this
court
considered
just
a
question
in
united
states
versus
feola.
that
case
involved
a
federal
statute
and
the
question
raised
was
whether
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
an
assailant
knew
that
his
victim
was
a
federal
officer
in
order
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
federal
assault
statute.
the
court
analyzed
congress'
purposes
in
enacting
the
statute
and
it
considered
whether
the
element
of
knowledge
was
necessary
as
a
matter
of
fairness,
in
order
to
prevent
unfairness,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
analysis
it
concluded
that
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
assault
statute
had
intended...
had
not
intended
to
require
the
government
to
prove
knowledge
of
federal
involvement
on
top
of
all
the
other
elements
it
was
required
to
prove.
we
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
feola
analysis
and
conclusions
apply
a
fortiori
in
the
case
of
section
1001.
we
begin
with
the
language,
and
here
i
think
we
have
a
stronger
case
than
the
court
was
confronted
with
in
feola.
there
the
federal
assault
statute
on
its
face
simply
didn't
say
anything
about
the
required
intent.
here
we
have
a
statute
that
talks
about
knowingly
and
willfully
making
a
false
statement,
so
we
have
words
of
intent.
but
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
face
of
the
statute
that
those
words
apply
to
the
making
of
a
false
statement
and
not
to
the
separate
phrase,
"in
any
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction.
"
ms.
carolyn
corwin
yes,
and
indeed
this
court
has
suggested
it
wasn't
intended.
in
bramblett
the
court
signified
that
it
had
not
intended
a
substantive
change.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
quite
so,
although
i
would
not
preliminarily
that
we
ought
to
give
some
credit
to
the
fact
that
in
1948
congress
thought
it
was
clarifying
an
ambiguity;
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
attempting
to
do
that
i
think
we
ought
to
read
today's
statute
rather
than
the
older
one.
but
even
if
the
language
had
never
been
shifted,
i
don't
think
that
changes
the
fact
that
that
"in
any
matter"
phrase
has
always
been
somewhat
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
statute
and
has
been
phrased
in
terms
that
don't
sound
at
all
in
any
sort
of
intent
or
purpose.
i
think
that's
significant
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
whether
you
look
at
the
old
statute
or
the
recodified
version,
and
i
think
it's
even
more
significant
when
you
look
at
the
language
that
had
existed
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1934.
there
you
had
a
phrase
that,
in
addition
to
the
knowingly
and
willfully
language,
said:
"whoever,
with
the
purpose
or
the
intent
of
cheating
or
swindling
or
defrauding
the
united
states,
knowingly
and
willfully
makes
a
false
statement.
"
in
1934
congress
replaced
that
language
with
this
"in
any
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction.
"
phrase,
a
phrase
that
doesn't
sound
at
all
in
any
sort
of
intent
or
purpose.
now,
the
court
in
feola
looked
primarily
to
the
legislative
purpose
and
the
legislative
history
to
determine
whether
congress
would
have
intended
that
knowledge
of
federal
involvement
be
an
element
of
the
crime.
under
section
1001,
these
factors
appear
to
point
at
least
as
clearly
as
in
feola
to
the
conclusion
that
knowledge
of
federal
involvement
is
not
something
that
congress
would
have
required
the
government
to
prove.
this
court
has
construed
section
1001
on
several
occasions...
in
the
gilliland
case,
in
the
bramblett
case,
and
in
the
bryson
case...
and
on
each
occasion
the
court
has
noted
the
breadth
of
the
statute
and
the
congressional
purpose
to
afford
protection
to
all
sorts
of
federal
functions.
the
court
has
concluded
that
it's
inappropriate
to
read
the
statute
restrictively
in
light
of
that
very
broad
congressional
purpose
in
amending
the
statute
in
1934.
now,
the
interest
in
protecting
federal
functions
is
one
that
exists
regardless
of
the
individual's
knowledge
of
whether
he
is
involved
in
a
government
matter.
in
this
case,
respondent's
false
statement
concerning
his
prior
conviction
and
his
prior
employers
had
just
as
much
potential
to
interfere
with
federal
functions,
whether
or
not
he
knew
about
whether
there
was
this
government
security
clearance
process
going
on.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
i
think
that
something
such
as
the
hypothetical
you're
suggesting
may
well
not
violate
the
statute,
although
i
don't
want
to
take
a
position
on
that
particular
mike
royko
incident.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
recall
that
the
government
has
to
prove
a
number
of
things
in
order
to
make
out
a
violation
of
section
1001
quite
apart
from
the
issue
we
have
here.
one
of
those
things
it
has
to
prove
is
that
a
statement
was
made
willfully.
i
think
that
in
such
a
case
as
you
posit--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
element
of
willfulness
which
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute
requires
some
sort
of
conscious
wrongdoing,
and
i
think
the
individual
who
engages
in
the
sort
of
private
conversation
or
perhaps
a
conversation
in
which
he
doesn't
expect
that
anyone
is
going
to
rely
in
any
meaningful
way
on
what
he
says--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
not.
i
mean,
in
order
to
make
out
the
violation
you
have
to
know
that
you've
made
a
false
statement.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
and
you
also...
the
government
also
must
prove
it's
in
a
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction,
as
well
as
being
in
many
cases
material
to
the
functions
of
the
government.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
and
i
suggest
that
maybe
some
of
those
elements
are
going
to
exclude
the
sort
of
hypotheticals
that
you've
suggested,
and
particularly
the
sort
of
hypotheticals
that
respondent
has
posed.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
that's
indeed
true,
and
i
suggest
that
perhaps
in
a
different
setting,
if
the
fbi
agent
were
working
undercover
in
a
business
perhaps,
you
might
have
a
situation
in
which
you
would
have
something
you
could
call
willful
conduct,
something
that
would
very
likely
violate
the
state
criminal
statute
of,
say,
false
pretenses,
and
there
you
might
have
coverage
because
the
conduct
was
willful.
but
i
don't
think,
for
example
in
the
hypotheticals
that
respondent
has
put
forward,
which
are
quite
far
from
his
own
case--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i'm
just
not
sure
that's
true.
if
i
were
a
federal
prosecutor
who
knew
i
had
to
make
out
the
elements
of
knowing
falsity
and
willfulness,
i
think
i
would
hesitate
before
i
would
indict
somebody
like
that.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
of
course,
the
statute
says
"knowingly
and
willfully",
and
i
think
that
the
element
of
conscious
wrongdoing
is
something
that
may
well
exclude
this
private
casual
conversation
between
neighbors,
in
which
you
never
anticipate
that
anyone's
going
to--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--i
think
that
if
one
could
prove
all
the
other
elements
of
the
statute
that,
yes,
that
would
be
a
crime.
but
i
would
point
out
that
you
have
a
situation
that
is
not
that
different
from
what
you
had
in
feola,
in
that
you
have
federal
functions
that
are
significant
that
you're
protecting
by
this
coverage
of
the
statute.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
think
that
in
many
cases
people
who
make
false
statements,
particularly
in
a
context
such
as
that
of
respondent,
they
are
certainly
going
to
know
that
their
conduct
is
wrongful.
and
i
suppose
it
depends
on
the
context,
when
you
suggest
the
lying
about
age;
and
i
remind
you
again
that
there
are
things
the
government
has
to
prove
in
terms
of,
for
example,
materiality,
and
it
may
be
that
a
statement
like
that
wouldn't
be
material.
but
i
think
that
a
false
statement,
particularly
in
the
sort
of
context
you
have
here,
in
the
employment
context,
is
not
only
going
to
be
something
someone
knows
is
wrongful,
but
is
either
going
to
come
quite
close
or
arguably
falls
within
the
state
false
pretenses
statute,
in
which
you
may
intend
to
deceive
your
employer,
and
that
is
something
that
falls
within
the
state
criminal
statute.
i
think
when
you
consider
the
sort
of
broad
purposes,
the
protection
of
federal
functions,
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute
in
1934,
you
are...
it's
very
difficult
to
conceive
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
somehow
carve
out
the
particular
sort
of
conduct
in
which
respondent
acts
in
this
case.
and
i
think
it's
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
impose,
in
addition
to
all
the
other
elements
that
the
government
has
to
prove,
that
additional
burden
of
proving
that
an
individual
actually
knew
that
he
was
acting
in
a
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
that's
right,
and
it
is
certainly
conceivable
that
on
a
remand
that
we
would
prevail
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
that
sort
of
evidence.
i
don't
know
that
that's
necessarily
going
to
be
the
case
every
time
this
comes
up,
and
i
think
it
may
well
be
that...
i
mean,
respondent
here
believes,
at
least
has
some
idea,
that
he
can
prevail
on
this
sort
of
standard,
and
i
think
it
is
not
certain
that
the
government
is
going
to
prevail
in
every
case
like
respondent's
with
the
sort
of
simply
evidence
of
knowledge
that's
circumstantial
that
you
suggest.
now,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
in
1934,
respondent
has
tried
to
suggest
that
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
something
very
narrow.
i
think
that
that
simply
is
not
so
when
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
legislative
history.
as
i
referred
to
when
i
spoke
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
the
substitution
of
the
phrase...
the
old
phrase,
"with
the
intent
or
purpose
of
defrauding
the
united
states.
"
was
replaced
by
this
new
phrase,
"in
any
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction.
"
i
think
that's
the
key
point
that
happened
in
1934.
but
when
you
look
at
some
of
the
other
material
in
the
legislative
history,
i
don't
think
it
supports
respondent's
construction
of
the
statute.
there
was
no
mention
of
attempting
to
correct
the
u.s.
versus
cohn
case.
that's
surely
something
that
congress
had
in
mind,
but
i
think
they
were
aiming
at
a
somewhat
broader
problem.
they
had
some
difficulties
that
had
arisen
in
some
of
these
federal
programs.
they
were
confronted
with
false
statements
that
were
causing
things
like
the
hot
oil
program
and
the
public
works
program
to
break
down,
and
they
were
attempting
to
find
a
comprehensive
solution
that
would
apply
to
a
number
of
federal
agencies
and
a
range
of
federal
functions.
now,
the
court
in
feola
also
turned
to
the
question
of
whether
it
was
unfair
to
convict
an
individual
without
that
element
of
knowledge
of
federal
involvement,
and
that's
a
relevant
question,
i
suppose,
because
it
tells
us
something
about
what
congress
must
have
had
in
mind
when
it
acted
at
the
time
here
in
1934,
and
indeed,
i
read
respondent
to
be
centering
his
argument
on
this
point.
but
i
think
as
i
noted
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
think
it
is
frequently
that
one
is
going
to
have
conduct
that
meets
all
the
elements
of
section
1001,
even
without
knowledge,
that
conduct
is
going
to
be
wrongful.
now,
respondent
here
acknowledges
that
his
conduct
was
wrongful.
he
says
no
question
about
that,
he
intended
to
deceive
his
employer.
he
just
didn't
know
that
he
was
also
deceiving
the
united
states.
and
he
poses
some
hypotheticals
that
involve,
as
i've
suggested
to
justice
stevens,
a
casual
private
conversation.
those
would
not
be
covered
under
section
1001.
the
government
would
not
have
been
able
to
prove
that
they
were
in
a
matter
within
federal
agency
jurisdiction,
in
all
probability,
and
would
not
have
been
able
to
prove
they
were
willful.
i
suggest
that
frequently
conduct
that
falls
within
section
1001
is
going
to
be
either
within
or
close
to
the
line
of
a
state
criminal
statute
and
is
clearly
going
to
be
the
sort
of
conscious
wrongdoing
that
we
really
don't
hesitate
to
impose
criminal
penalties
on.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
precisely
right
in
the
hot
oil
context.
what
people
were
doing
in
the
hot
oil
context
was
certifying
that
they
had
not
exceeded
state
law
production
limits,
and
that
is
the
sort
of
information--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
congress
had
in
mind
that
sort
of
interference
with
federal
functions.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
you
could
have
a
situation,
as
you
suggested,
like
the
one
respondent
is
involved
in
here,
in
which
someone
within
the
petroleum,
the
oil
company,
passes
on
information
to
someone
else,
who
then
forwards
it
to
the
federal
government.
maybe
the
defense
is:
well,
all
i
was
certifying
was
there
was
no
excess
over
the
state
quota,
so
i
thought
i
was
deceiving
the
state
government,
or
i
thought
i
was
deceiving
my
employer.
but
you
still
have
the
same
sort
of
harm
to
the
hot
oil
program.
i
would
just
mention
in
passing
that
another
regulation
under
that
program
in
1933
was
actually
affidavits
going
between
private
parties.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
suppose
that's
possible.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
necessarily
not
wrongful
conduct,
although
if
you
could
prove
that
somehow
the
motive
was
a
justifiable
one,
was
one
that
just
doesn't
fall
within
that
willful
conduct
category,
that
you
still
may
not
get
all
the
way
under
your
section
1001,
your
other
elements
you
have
to
prove.
i
think
you
just
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
federal
government
has
to
prove
a
lot
of
things
under
this
statute,
and
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
impose
this
additional
burden
in
a
case
like
the
one
we
have
before
us.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
many
courts
have...
well,
the
willfulness
is
separate.
i
think
that
there
is
an
element
of
willfulness
that
is
not
necessarily
encompassed
within
a
knowingly
false
statement.
many
courts
have
also
read
the
concept
of
materiality
into
the
statute,
and
i
think
there
you
wipe
out
a
lot
of
these
sort
of
trivial
examples
in
which
somebody
just,
you
know,
says
something
very
minor,
they're
a
day
off
on
their
age
or
something
like
that.
i
think
that,
as
in
feola,
you
simply
do
not
have
the
sort
of
unfairness
or
any
other
reason
to
depart
from
what
appears
to
be
the
clear
import
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
broad
legislative
purpose
and
the
legislative
history
from
1934.
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
meant
to
carve
out
a
special
category
that
would
cover
respondent's
conduct
in
its
protection
of
federal
functions
or
to
impose
the
additional
burden
of
proof
that
respondent
urges
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
just
a
brief
response.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
point
out
again
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
respondent
who
acknowledges
that
his
conduct
was
fraudulent.
some
of
the
rather
marginal
examples
that
have
been
discussed
up
here,
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
i
think
it
is
quite
unlikely
that
you're
going
to
find
those
either
being
prosecuted
or
being
prosecutable,
because
there
is
this
requirement
of
willfulness.
this
is
a
separate
requirement
from
the
knowledge
requirement
under
section
1001,
and
i
think
it
involves
someone's
sense
of
whether
someone
else
is
going
to
rely
to
their
detriment
on
the
statements
he
is
making.
i
think
that--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
this
context
of
false
statements
a
person's
state
of
mind
would
be
affected
by
whether
he
expected
that
the
context
in
which
he
was
speaking
would
induce
someone
else
to
rely
to
their
detriment
or
to
give
him
a
benefit
based
on
what
he
was
saying.
i
think
the
conversation
with
a
neighbor
is
one
that
you
wash
out
with
the
willfulness
requirement.
i
would
not
that
you
would
also
wipe
it
out
with
the
"knew
or
should
have
known"
expression,
with
that
instruction
as
well.
and
i
would
suggest
to
justice
stevens
that
i
think
the
question
we
presented
in
the
petition,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
that
particular
concern.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
simply
suggest
that
perhaps
in
looking
at
what
"knew"
means
in
that
question,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
stop
short
of
actual
knowledge
if
the
court
concludes
that
our
initial
position
is
incorrect.
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
that,
but
i
think
it
is
simply
our
position
that
that
would
be
broad
enough
to
raise
it.
respondent
has
noted
the
veto
of
the
bill
in
1934.
i
think
that's
significant.
the
veto
was
on
the
ground,
president
roosevelt
said
you
haven't
done
anything
more
in
your
attempted
amendment
here
than
is
on
the
books
now,
and
besides,
you've
reduced
the
penalties.
congress
went
back
to
the
drawing
board
and,
i
think,
looked
pretty
carefully
at
the
language
it
was
using
when
it
then
enacted
the
bill
that
became
law.
and
i
would
note
again
that
there
is...
while
congress
was
clearly
interested
in
reaching
the
problem
that
was
presented
by
the
cohn
decision,
the
discussion
on
the
floor
does
not
have...
or
in
committee,
does
not
relate,
does
not
mention
cohn,
and
does
not
even
frame
things
in
terms
of
monetary
versus
non-monetary
interest
of
the
government.
the
discussion
was
in
terms
of
affording
broad
protection
to
some
pretty
expansive
programs
and
to
closing
all
the
loopholes
that
had
been
creating
these
practical
problems
for
the
government.
respondent
suggests
that
intermediary
cases
are
a
new
thing.
i
don't
think
that's
so.
i
think
even
if
you
look
at
the
new
deal
programs,
they
were
using
state
governments
under
the
public
works
program
to
administer
some
of
those
programs.
and
of
course,
you
always
have
the
situation
that
was
discussed
earlier,
in
which
an
employee
forwards
information
to
another
employee
within
the
organization.
but
the
state
cases
call
to
mind
the
problems
that
have
arisen
in
the
other
cases
that
have
raised
this
issue,
and
that
is
the
programs
like
medicaid,
in
which
individuals
make
statements
to
state
agencies
that
are
then
forwarded
to
federal
agencies
and
are
the
purpose...
are
the
basis
for
providing
federal
funding.
it
is
not
always
easy
to
prove,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
point,
it
is
not
always
easy
to
prove
in
that
sort
of
program
administered
by
states,
that
an
individual
knew
about
the
federal
involvement.
thank
you.
