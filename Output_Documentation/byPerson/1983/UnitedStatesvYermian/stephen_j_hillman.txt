mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
address
myself
to
two
points
that
justice
stevens
raised.
i
also
thought
of
the
mike
royko
example
as
i
was
on
the
plane
to
washington,
and
i
think
that
if
a
federal
elections
official,
perhaps,
who
was
present
in
chicago
ensuring
the
integrity
of
a
local
election
approached
a
person
who
was
exiting
the
polls
and
did
not
make
his
identity
known
to
that
person,
and
that
person
lied
about
who
he
voted
for,
i
believe
that
under
the
government's
interpretation
that
person
could
be
charged
under
1001.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
i
think
that
such
a
question
could
arise
during
the
questioning
by
a
federal
election
official
who
was
there
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
voting
process.
he
might
ask
the
person
some
other
question
that
would
not--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--well,
supposing
the
federal
official
was
acting
improperly.
it
is
a
far-fetched
example,
but
i
did
want
to
address
justice
stevens'
concerns.
i
think
that
justice
stevens
also
raised
a
better
hypothetical--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--the
requirement
of
materiality
may
not
be
enough.
i
think
that
there
has
to
also
be,
there
has
to
be
a
knowledge
requirement,
there
has
to
be
intending
to
do
something
that
the
law
forbids.
there
has
to
be
something
willfully
done.
justice
stevens
raised
a
hypothetical
that
really
places...
is
really
better
than
our
hypothetical,
and
that
is
where
the
neighbor
is
an
fbi
agent
and
not
just
a
private
party.
a
neighbor
who
is
an
fbi
agent,
who
may
be,
his
actual
job
may
be
to
inquire
into
a
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
the
person
we
call
x
in
our
brief,
might
be
unknown
to
the
neighbor.
and
i
think
that
under
the
government's
interpretation
1001
could
apply
to
that
as
well.
justice
o'connor
correctly
stated
that
one
of
the
main
reasons
we're
here
is
because
of
an
incorrect
jury
instruction.
the
instruction
actually
did
not
say
that
the
defendant
should
have...
would
have
reason
to
know
or
that
the
jury
would
have
to
find
reason
to
know.
but
the
jury
instruction
actually
said
that
the
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
information
was
to
be
submitted
to
a
government
agency.
and
we
believe
that
that
instruction
is
entirely
inappropriate
and
ambiguous,
because
it
would
allow
the
jury
to
convict
believing
that
the
person
should
have
morally
known
that
his
statement
was
going
to--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--the
government
does
argue,
your
honor,
that
even
if
our
position
is
correct,
that
the
jury
instruction
cured
any
error,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
incorrect
because
it
was
an
ambiguously
worded--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--all
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
yes,
it
is,
on
page
49.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
49,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
knowledge
of
federal
involvement.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
knowledge
that
the
statement
is
within
federal
jurisdiction,
that
it
is
destined
for
a
federal
agency,
that
there
is
some
material
legitimate
concern
on
behalf
of
a
federal
agency.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
of
course.
of
course,
because
he
would
have
knowledge
face
to
face
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
federal
agency.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
don't
need
any--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--no,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
no.
we
only
requested
the
instruction
on
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
your
honor's
hypothetical
of
the
fbi
agent
coming
to
the
door
is
certainly
an
appropriate
one.
we
would
concede
that
you
certainly
don't
need
face
to
face,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
face
to
face
transaction
in
order
to
come
within
the
ambit
of
1001.
all
of
the
intermediary
cases
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
making
statements
solely
to
state
agencies
or
private
employers,
but
they
have,
from
the
facts
it
is
clear
that
they
have,
knowledge
of
the
final
destination
of
the
statement.
i
believe
that
the
experience
of
the
lower
courts
tells
us
that
when
a
defense
of
no
knowledge
is
raised,
that
the
facts
will
usually
overwhelmingly
rebut
a
defendant's
claim
of
no
knowledge
if
it
is
a
sham.
i
would
ask
the
court
to
compare
the
operation
and
the
usefulness
of
perhaps
the
mail
fraud
statute,
section
1341.
the
usefulness
of
that
statute
to
the
government
is
certainly
not
impaired,
even
though
this
court
has
held
that
the
defendant
must
know
that
the
use
of
the
mails
is
reasonably
foreseeable.
a
defense
of
lack
of
reasonable
foreseeability
of
the
use
of
the
mails
in
my
experience
is
rarely
raised,
and
even
far
less
to
be
successful.
and
i
certainly
do
not
hear
the
government
complaining
that
the
requirement
of
reasonable
foreseeability
of
the
use
of
the
mails
obstructs
the
usefulness
of
the
statute.
similarly,
i
think
we
could
look
at
title
21,
the
statutes
which
prohibit
knowing
importation
of
narcotics.
the
standard
there
is,
of
course,
that
the
person
must
know
that
he
is
importing
contraband.
he
need
not
know
the
specific
narcotic
that
he
is
carrying,
but
he
must
know
that
he
is
carrying
a
controlled
substance.
day
after
day
we
have
people
entering
this
country
with
narcotics--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--yes,
he
did.
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
my
point,
your
honor,
is
simply--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--yes,
and
he
was
subject
to
state--
mr.
stephen
j.
hillman
--he
was
subject
to
state
penalties.
but
i
believe
that,
with
the
drug
importation
analogy,
the
government
is
not
heard
to
complain
that
they
are
put
to
proof
by
proving
knowledge
that
the
person
was
importing
a
controlled
substance.
the
government
does
justifiably
raise
some
concerns
that
our
interpretation
could
lead
to
a
serious
situation,
such
as
perhaps
a
knowingly
defective
part
being
placed
in
a
nuclear
reactor
without
someone
knowing
that
it
was
going
to
be
within
a
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction.
that
is
an
appropriate
concern.
i
believe,
however,
that
such
an
action
is
inherently
dangerous
and
gives
notice
to
the
wrongdoer
of
the
danger,
and
i
think
that
the
action
could
be
proscribed
under
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
freed.
for
situations
which
are
not
inherently
dangerous,
congress
could
if
it
chose
draft
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
submissions
of
false
statements
which
affect
a
federal
agency,
and
could
if
it
chose
eliminate
a
jurisdictional
knowledge
requirement.
for
the
very
small
class
of
persons
whose
actions
are
not
fraudulent,
we
contend
that
our
interpretation
is
a
justifiable
and
necessary
protection.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you.
