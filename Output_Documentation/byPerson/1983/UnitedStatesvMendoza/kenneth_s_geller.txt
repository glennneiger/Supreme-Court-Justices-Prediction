mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
was
brought
by
respondent
mendoza
in
1978
in
an
effort
to
become
a
naturalized
american
citizen.
it's
undisputed
that
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
naturalization
under
any
provision
of
the
immigration
laws
that
are
now
in
effect.
it's
also
undisputed
that
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
expressly
provides
that
an
alien
may
not
be
naturalized
under
any
expired
provision
of
law.
now,
despite
these
seemingly
insurmountable
barriers
to
respondent's
naturalization,
the
district
court
granted
that
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
lower
courts
held
that
the
united
states
was
collaterally
estopped
to
oppose
respondent's
naturalization
because
the
constitutional
argument
presented
by
respondent
in
support
of
his
claim
for
citizenship
had
been
decided
adversely
to
the
united
states
in
a
prior
district
court
case
involving
other
unrelated
aliens.
and
we've
sought
certiorari
to
challenge
this
unprecedented
and
we
believe
quite
destructive
application
of
collateral
estoppel
on
an
issue
of
law.
now,
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
background
of
this
case
because
it
confronted
essentially
an
identical
situation
in
ins
versus
hibi,
which
was
decided
in
1973.
the
case
relates
to
events
that
occurred
in
the
philippines
during
the
end
of
world
war
two.
briefly,
in
1942
congress
passed
the
second
war
powers
act.
section
701
of
that
act
made
it
easier
for
aliens
serving
honorably
in
the
united
states
armed
forces
to
become
american
citizens,
and
section
702
of
that
act
provided
for
the
overseas
naturalization
of
aliens
who
are
eligible
for
citizenship
under
section
701.
now,
naturalizations
under
section
702
obviously
were
not
possible
in
the
philippines
until
1945,
when
the
japanese
occupation
ended.
and
in
august
1945
the
ins
sent
a
designated
naturalization
examiner
to
the
philippines
to
begin
performing
naturalizations
under
section
701
and
702.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
section
702
contemplated
that
naturalizations
would
take
place
overseas.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
although
section
705
of
the
act
gave
the
attorney
general
tremendous
discretion
in
how
to
implement
the
act,
and
this
court
held
that
in
hibi.
almost
immediately
upon
the
designated
naturalization
examiner's
arrival
in
the
philippines
in
august
1945,
the
philippine
government
objected.
it
was
concerned
that
a
large
number
of
young
filipino
men,
perhaps
as
many
as
250,000,
would
seek
to
become
american
citizens
under
this
provision
and
leave
for
the
united
states
on
the
even
of
philippine
independence,
which
was
then
scheduled
for
july
1946.
in
response
to
this
diplomatic
complaint,
attorney
general
tom
clarke,
in
consultation
with
the
ins
and
the
department
of
state,
revoked
the
authority
of
the
naturalization
examiner
under
section
701
and
702
and
naturalization
ceased
in
the
philippines
under
these
provisions
around
the
end
of
october
1945.
the
authority
of
the
naturalization
examiner
was
reinstated
nine
months
later
in
august
of
1946
and
naturalizations
began
once
again
in
the
philippines
and
continued
until
december
1946,
when
sections
701
and
702
expired
by
their
own
terms.
now,
hibi,
as
the
court
will
recall,
was
a
case
brought
by
a
filipino
veteran
who
did
not
seek
naturalization
under
section
701
and
702
until
1967,
20
years
after
those
provisions
had
expired.
but
hibi
claimed
that
the
united
states
was
equitably
estopped
from
relying
on
the
expiration
date
of
those
statutes
because
of
the
government's
failure
to
station
a
naturalization
examiner
in
the
philippines
for
the
nine-month
period
between
october
1945
and
august
1946.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
that
argument
and
held
that
the
united
states
was
equitably
estopped.
but
this
court
summarily
reversed.
the
court
held
that
the
federal
government
could
not
be
estopped
from
enforcing
the
immigration
laws
passed
by
congress,
except
perhaps
if
it
had
engaged
in
some
affirmative
government
misconduct.
but
the
court
quickly
added
that
the
government
had
not
engaged
in
any
affirmative
misconduct
in
the
way
it
had
administered
section
701
and
702
in
the
philippines,
including
by
not
having
a
naturalization
examiner
there
for
the
nine-month
period
that's
crucial
to
these
cases.
not
long
after
hibi
was
decided,
a
new
group
of
filipino
veterans
brought
suit
to
try
to
obtain
american
citizenship
under
sections
701
and
702.
this
is
the
so-called
68
filipinos
litigation
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
examiners
were
removed
at
the
end
of
1946
because
by
its
terms
sections
701
and
702
expired
and
therefore
there
was
no
further
statutory
authority
after
december.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
naturalization
examiner
was
withdrawn
for
the
nine-month
period
between
october
1945
and
august
1946
because
of
the
objections
of
the
philippine
government.
but
the
naturalization
examiner
was
reinstated
in
august
1946
and
he
served
until
december
1946.
at
the
end
of
1946
the
statute
he
was
administering
expired,
and
that's
why
at
the
end
of
1946
he
was
withdrawn
from
the
philippines.
now,
in
the
68
filipinos
litigation
which
was
brought
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
even
though
this
court
had
just
decided
in
hibi
that
attorney
general
clarke's
actions
in
withdrawing
this
naturalization
examiner
for
nine
months
did
not
constitute
affirmative
government
misconduct,
the
district
court
in
68
filipinos
held
that
this
very
same
conduct
constituted
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
the
court
therefore
ordered
the
government
to
grant
citizenship
to
the
filipino
plaintiffs
in
that
case
as
a
remedy
for
the
due
process
violation.
it's
important
to
mention
at
this
point
that
68
filipinos
was
not
a
class
action.
the
government
took
an
appeal
in
68
filipinos
and
it
filed
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
interim,
however,
a
new
administration
came
into
office.
the
new
commissioner
of
immigration
took
a
look
at
the
case
and
recommended
that
the
appeal
in
68
filipinos
be
withdrawn.
the
commissioner
did
not
suggest
in
his
memos
to
the
justice
department
that
the
case
had
been
correctly
decided,
but
he
suggested
that
it
would
be
in
keeping
with
the
immigration
policies
of
the
new
administration
to
withdraw
the
appeal
in
that
case
and
let
those
68
filipinos
become
citizens
pursuant
to
the
district
court's
order.
there
was
substantial
disagreement
within
the
justice
department
as
to
this
recommendation,
but
ultimately
the
appeal
in
68
filipinos
was
withdrawn
in
november
1977.
now,
almost
immediately
after
the
decision
was
made
to
withdraw
the
appeal
the
justice
department
began
to
reassess
whether
it
had
acted
wisely.
in
part,
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
commissioner
of
immigration
had
been
summoned
to
capitol
hill
to
explain
the
reasons
why
the
government
had
decided
to
drop
the
appeal
in
the
68
filipinos
case,
even
though
the
district
court's
decision
seemed
to
be
inconsistent
with
hibi.
the
upshot
of
the
government's
reassessment
was
that
in
april
1978
the
justice
department
decided
that
henceforth
it
would
continue
to
oppose
the
naturalization
of
filipino
veterans
who,
a,
were
not
eligible
for
citizenship
under
current
law,
and
who,
b,
had
made
no
attempt
to
apply
for
citizenship
under
section
701
and
702
during
the
period
of
time
that
those
laws
were
in
effect
back
in
1945
and
1946.
now,
respondent
mendoza
is
one
of
that
category
of
filipinos.
he
is
not
eligible
for
citizenship
under
current
law
and
he
made
no
effort
to
apply
for
citizenship
under
sections
701
and
702
during
the
period
of
time
that
those
laws
were
in
effect.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
the
68
filipinos
case?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it's
hard
to
make
an
accurate
assessment.
at
the
time
the
memos
were
written
as
to
whether
the
appeal
should
be
withdrawn,
there
was
an
estimate
that
there
might
be
as
many
as
25,000
people
who
would
be
eligible
for
that
relief.
now,
later
on
when
it
was
decided
to
reinstate
the
government's
position
in
the
spring
of
1978,
further
information
led
the
government
to
conclude
that
the
numbers
might
be
much
larger,
perhaps
as
many
as
75,000,
although
i
must
say
that
the
government's
concern--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--only
about
100
had
applied,
although
in
part
the
concern
was
not
so
much
with
the
number
who
had
applied
for
relief
under
sections
701
and
702,
but
with
the
fact
that
if
these
people
became
citizens
then
all
of
their
relatives
would
be
entitled
to
a
number
of
preferences
under
the
immigration
laws.
we
have
argued,
we
argued
in
the
lower
courts,
that
in
part
the
decision
to
reinstate
the
government's
position
in
april
'78
was
due
to
a
reassessment
of
the
number
of
filipino
veterans
who
would
be
subject
to
these
laws.
but
in
part
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
reassessment
was
based
on
the
conclusion
that
it
had
been
unwise
as
a
matter
of
law
to
drop
the
appeal.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
category
two
is
much,
much
larger
than
category
one.
there
are
very,
very
few
people
who
fall
into
category
one,
a
handful
of
people.
now,
as
i
said,
the
respondent
mendoza
is
a
member
of
this
group,
category
two
in
judge
renfrew's
terminology.
when
he
applied
for
citizenship
in
1978,
the
government
opposed
because
he
is
not
eligible
for
citizenship
under
the
current
law
and
because
he
had
never
made
any
attempt
to
apply
for
citizenship
in
1945
and
1946
when
the
sections
701
and
702
were
in
effect.
but
the
district
court
treated
this
case
as
simply
a
routine
application
of
offensive
non-mutual
collateral
estoppel.
the
court
held
that,
since
the
government
had
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
due
process
issue
in
the
68
filipinos
case,
it
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
relitigate
the
same
legal
issue
in
this
case.
and,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
this
analysis
and
affirmed.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
plainly
wrong
on
a
number
of
different
levels.
if
we
approach
the
case
simply
as
a
technical
legal
matter,
it
seems
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
simply
misapplied
black-letter
principles
of
estoppel
law.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
parklane
hosiery,
without
realizing
that
parklane
really
just
talked
about
collateral
estoppel
on
an
issue
of
fact.
different
considerations
have
always
been
applied
to
preclusion
on
issues
of
law.
the
settled
rule
as
set
forth
in
this
court's
cases,
such
as
moser,
montana,
and
as
explained
in
the
various
restatements
of
judgments,
is
that
estoppel
on
a
pure
or
unmixed
question
of
law
is
never
appropriate
unless,
at
a
minimum,
there
are
the
same
parties
to
the
two
lawsuits
and
the
two
lawsuits
involve
the
same
so-called
"demand",
to
use
the
moser
and
montana
terminology.
now,
those
requirements
were
plainly
not
met
here
because
mendoza
was
not
a
party
to
the
68
filipinos
litigation
and
by
no
stretch
of
the
language
can
respondent
mendoza's
demand
to
become
a
citizen
be
considered
the
same
demand
as
the
naturalization
claims
of
the
unrelated
aliens
in
the
68
filipinos
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
issue
preclusion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
although
in
montana
the
court
essentially
said,
using
the
moser
terminology,
that
the
two
lawsuits
involved
the
same
demand.
so
i
think
montana
is
a
correct
application
of
the
legal
principles
we're
relying
on
here,
because
the
two
lawsuits
in
montana
involved
the
same
parties
and
involved
the
same
demand,
whereas
here
neither
requirement
is
met.
the
68
filipinos
case
and
this
case
don't
involve
the
same
parties.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
was
in
a
sense
res
judicata.
the
only
reason
it
wasn't
technically
res
judicata
is
because
there
were
slightly
different
contracts
involved.
it
wasn't
really
the
same
cause
of
action,
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
issue
preclusion
involving
the
same
demand
and
res
judicata.
res
judicata
requires
that
it
be
the
same
precise
cause
of
action.
what
was
decided
in
68
filipinos
was
that
those
discrete
plaintiffs
had
had
their
due
process
rights
violated
by
what
the
attorney
general
had
done
in
1945
and
1946.
that
was
the
distinct
fact
question--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes.
now,
that
was
the
distinct
fact
question
or
right
distinctly
adjudged,
to
use
the
moser
terminology.
now,
the
government
does
not
wish
to
relitigate
that
issue
in
this
case.
it's
quite
irrelevant
whether
somebody
else's
due
process
rights
were
violated
in
respondent
mendoza's
case.
respondent
mendoza
has
to
show
that
some
government
action
violated
his
rights
and
that
he
is
entitled
as
a
result
to
the
relief
of
citizenship.
now,
that
fact
question
or
right,
whether
respondent
mendoza's
has
had
his
due
process
rights
violated
and
whether
he's
entitled
to
the
remedy
of
citizenship,
was
never
distinctly
adjudged
in
the
68
filipinos
litigation,
nor
could
it
have
been
because
he
wasn't
even
a
party
to
that
litigation.
there
are,
we
believe,
strong
practical
and
policy
reasons
why
the
strict
and
traditional
restrictions
on
the
collateral
estoppel
doctrine
as
applied
to
issues
of
law
should
be
strictly
adhered
to.
collateral
estoppel,
of
course,
is
an
equitable
doctrine.
the
courts
have
discretion
whether
to
apply
it,
and
one
of
the
guiding
principles
is
that
the
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
where
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so
or
where
its
application
would,
as
the
court
said
in
parkland,
for
any
reason
be
unfair
or
unjust.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
probably
was
a
correct
application
of
the
principles
that
we
rely
on
here,
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
the
principles
that
we're
relying
on
here
are
fully
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
montana,
because
in
montana
there
was
an
identity
of
parties
between
the
first
and
the
second
lawsuit,
and
the
court's
analysis
showed
why
it
was
the
same
"demand",
to
use
the
moser
terminology.
and
here
neither
of
those
requirements
are
met.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
government
did
argue
for
a
different
result
in
montana,
justice
white.
the
principal
reason
for
the
collateral
estoppel
doctrine,
as
the
court
has
mentioned
in
parklane,
i
think
we
all
agree,
is
to
prevent
needless
relitigation,
needless
relitigation.
now,
when
the
issue
involved
is
one
of
fact
i
think
we
can
all
understand
why
there
is
no
great
public
interest
served
by
allowing
the
losing
party
to
have
a
second
shot
at
trying
to
explain
why
a
particular
fact
situation
is
as
he
alleges
it
to
be,
rather
than
as
the
first
court
found
it
to
be.
but
when
we're
dealing
with
a
legal
issue,
and
particularly
when
we're
dealing
with
an
issue
of
constitutional
dimensions
as
we
are
in
this
case,
it's
really
hard
to
conclude
that
relitigation
in
cases
involving
other
parties
is
needless.
quite
the
opposite
would
seem
to
be
true.
it
would
appear
quite
foolish
or
perverse
to
allow
collateral
estoppel
to
perpetuate
what
might
be
an
erroneous
rule
of
law.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
don't
challenge,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
the
second
case
involved
the
same
cause
of
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
of
course
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
would
be
precluded
from
litigating
anything
in
a
second
case
based
on
the
same
cause
of
action.
but
that
really
doesn't
raise
any
of
the
concerns
that
we
have
about
freezing
the
development
of
the
law
that
issue
preclusion
does.
we
think
it
would
substantially
disrupt
the
development
of
the
law
if
a
legal
principle
could
not
be
challenged
or
reassessed
by
a
coordinate
court
in
a
second
case.
constant
re-examination
of
legal
rulings
by
coordinate
courts
is,
we
think,
a
healthy
and
wholesome
development.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
court
particularly
would
be
ill
served
if
it
regularly
had
to
decide
legal
issues
without
the
benefit
of
divergent
lower
court
opinions,
which
often
serve
to
highlight
or
sharpen
the
legal
issues.
the
court
has
often
remarked
on
the
value
of
having
a
legal
issue
mature
through
the
lower
courts
before
it's
finally
resolved
here.
now,
perhaps
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
if
applied
to
private
parties,
wouldn't
be
all
that
harmful,
because
most
private
parties
don't
litigate
a
legal
issue
more
than
once,
and
most
private
litigants
don't
forego
an
appeal
when
they
think
their
legal
arguments
are
sound.
but
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
conduct
of
institutional
litigants,
and
particularly
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
is
constantly
involved
in
litigating
legal
issues
on
a
nationwide
basis.
in
fact,
many
legal
issues,
such
as
the
immigration
issues
in
this
case
and
most
constitutional
issues,
really
only
can
arise
in
government
litigation.
and
if
the
government
were
compelled
to
abide
by
the
first
decision
adverse
to
its
position,
we
submit
it
would
have
a
number
of
unfortunate
results.
for
one
thing,
the
government
would
have
to
abandon
its
traditional,
and
we
think
quite
salutary,
policy
of
carefully
screening
the
cases
it
takes
on
appeal,
and
particularly
the
cases
it
takes
to
this
court.
and
i
daresay
it
would
impose
a
substantial
burden
on
this
court
if
it
knew
that
it
had
to
grant
review
of
the
first
petition
drafted
by
the
government
on
a
legal
issue
or
else
the
lower
court's
decision
would
become
forever
binding
on
a
nationwide
basis.
in
fact,
i
guess
to
the
extent
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
requires
that
appeals
be
taken
that
wouldn't
otherwise
be
taken,
it
really
retards
rather
than
advances
one
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
think
that
it
would;
if
the
government
has
announced
its
legal
position
in
the
course
of
litigating
a
case
and
that
works
its
way
into
a
court
judgment,
that
the
government
would
be
bound.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
a
permissible
reading
of
the
ninth
circuit's
position,
and
that's
what
has
us
troubled.
there
are
other
harmful
consequences
as
well,
i
think,
that
flow
from
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling.
if
the
government
were
allowed
only
one
legal
bite
at
any
legal
issue,
it
would
tend
to
petrify
or
freeze
the
law
quite
unnaturally
and
often
quite
unfairly.
this
court
pointed
out
in
standefer
that
litigation
over
public
rights
stand
on
a
decidedly
different
footing
than
private
litigation
when
it
comes
to
applications
of
the
preclusion
doctrine.
preclusion
on
a
legal
issue
might
prevent
the
government
from
bringing
or
defending
some
lawsuit
that
we
would
all
agree
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
in
fact,
i
suppose
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
would
allow
one
administration
to
bind
a
future
administration
on
an
issue
of
constitutional
law
or
statutory
construction,
simply
by
not
appealing
some
adverse
decision.
it
would
also
prevent
the
government
from
changing
policies
over
time
in
response
to
changes
in
outlook
or
experience,
and
this
case
is
in
many
ways
a
textbook
example
of
what
i'm
talking
about,
because
the
decision
to
drop
the
appeal
in
68
filipinos
and
then
the
decision
to
reconsider
that
decision
and
to
begin...
and
to
enforce
the
immigration
laws
in
a
particular
way,
is
the
sort
of
constant
reassessment
of
administrative
and
legal
positions,
enforcement
positions,
that
the
government
frequently
undertakes,
and
that
we
would
all
agree
the
government
should
be
encouraged
to
undertake
in
a
democratic
society.
now,
in
a
sense
perhaps
i've
been
a
trifle
unfair
in
describing
the
ninth
circuit's
rule,
because
to
be
fair
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
there
may
be
certain
circumstances
where
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
collaterally
estop
the
government
on
an
issue
of
law.
the
court
suggested
that
estoppel
was
appropriate
here
because
it
found
no
"critical
need"
to
re-examine
the
legal
issue
and
no
great
public
interest
in
opposing
respondent's
naturalization.
we
obviously
disagree
with
both
of
these
contentions
on
the
merits.
but
the
more
important
point
for
these
purposes
is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
test
is
totally
unworkable.
when
the
government
has
to
make
its
decision
whether
to
appeal
an
adverse
ruling,
it
would
be
hard
to
predict
how
a
court
later
on
might
decide
whether
there
was
a
critical
need
for
re-examination
or
whether
the
issue
was
important.
we
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
district
courts
or
courts
of
appeals
are
empowered
to
refuse
to
decide
legal
issues
because
they
don't
consider
them
important
enough.
now,
i
just
want
to
add
one
more
word
about
the
ninth
circuit's
collateral
estoppel
ruling
in
this
case.
even
if
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
everything
i've
said
up
until
now,
we
think
it
would
still
have
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
precluded
the
government
from
litigating
not
only
issues
that
were
raised
and
decided
in
the
68
filipinos
case,
but
also
a
number
of
quite
significant
legal
issues
that
were
never
litigated
in
68
filipinos.
even
as
applied
to
an
issue
of
fact,
collateral
estoppel
has
never
been
taken
that
far.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
confused
collateral
estoppel
with
res
judicata.
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief
a
number
of
the
significant
legal
issues
that
were
never
raised
in
68
filipinos
that
we
would
like
the
opportunity
at
the
very
least
to
raise
in
respondent's
case,
involving
laches
and
the
effect
of
section
1421(e),
an
important
legal
issue
as
to
whether,
even
if
a
due
process
violation
occurred,
a
court
has
the
power
to
order
citizenship
as
a
remedy.
i
do
want
to
mention
one
specifically
because
i
think
it
particularly
shows
the
unfairness
of
the
application
of
collateral
estoppel
in
this
case.
even
if
the
government
were
precluded
from
challenging
the
due
process
holding
in
the
68
filipinos
case,
there
would
still
be
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
this
respondent
is
entitled
to
the
relief
that
the
68
filipinos
plaintiffs
received,
because
the
68
filipinos
plaintiffs
had
all
been
in
the
philippines
during
the
nine-month
period
that
the
naturalization
examiner
was
absent,
whereas
respondent
mendoza
was
in
the
united
states
for
six
of
those
months
and
could
easily
have
applied
for
citizenship
under
section
701
simply
by
going
into
any
united
states
district
court.
so
it's
very
hard
to
understand
why,
at
the
very
least,
the
government
is
estopped
from
litigating
whether
this
respondent
is
entitled
to
the
substantial
benefit
of
citizenship,
when
there
are
substantial
legal
and
mixed
questions
that
were
never
litigated
in
the
68
filipinos
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
know
of
any
other
cases.
there
was,
of
course,
the
olegario
case,
which
involved
an
identical
situation
and
was
decided
in
the
government's
favor
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
was
just,
i
believe,
one
alien.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
i
think
it's
probably
unfair
to
suggest
that
the
public
interest
in
this
case
is
in
some
respect--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
i
don't
think
there
are
very
many
filipino
aliens
who
would
still
take
advantage.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
yes,
i
think
so.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
just
like
to
clarify
one
answer
i
gave
to
justice
stevens.
there
is
in
fact
one
case
that
is
proceeding
through
the
courts
that
raises
this
identical
issue.
that
is
the
litonjua
case
that
counsel
referred
to,
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
simply
applied
its
mendoza
rationale.
we
have
filed
a
protective
certiorari
petition
here.
it's
no.
82-1877.
thank
you.
