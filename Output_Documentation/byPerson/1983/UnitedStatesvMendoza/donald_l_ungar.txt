mr.
donald
l.
ungar
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--it's
all
right
this
way,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
client,
dr.
mendoza,
is
a
man
who
cannot
understand
why
the
government
is
making
it
so
hard
for
him
to
become
an
american
citizen
when
it
has
already
agreed
to
the
naturalization
of
other
filipino
veterans
who
fought
side
by
side
with
him
in
places
like
bataan
and
corregidor
and
who
were
naturalized
just
as
he
was
filing
his
own
application
under
the
very
same
law
that's
at
issue
in
this
particular
case.
in
his
opinion
that's
simply
unfair.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
he's
testified
at
the
district
court
that
he
didn't
apply
because
he
didn't
know
about
it.
of
course,
that
raises
a
question
that
mr.
geller
brings
up,
about
his
presence
in
the
united
states.
obviously,
he
was
present
in
this
country
for
a
time
during
1945
when
he
might
have
applied
had
he
known
about
it.
but
what
mr.
geller
doesn't
explain
and
leaves
us
guessing
is
why
that
should
make
a
difference.
and
i
say
that
because
there
was
nothing
in
this
particular
wartime
naturalization
law
which
compelled
a
soldier
or
sailor
to
apply
while
he
was
in
the
united
states,
or
that
he
had
to
apply
at
any
particular
place,
or
that
he
had
to
apply
at
any
particular
time
during
the
statutory
period.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
major
points
of
this
law
was
that
soldiers
and
sailors
who
were
on
duty
overseas
could
apply
overseas.
so
that
if
dr.
mendoza
had
known
about
this
law
at
the
time,
it
would
have
been
perfectly
reasonable
for
him
to
make
a
decision
that
he
would
apply
or
decide
to
apply
when
he
returned
to
the
philippines.
there's
a
lot
of
considerations
which
go
into
whether
someone
could
apply
for
naturalization.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
in
a
sense
it
does,
justice
rehnquist.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
is
claiming
that
that
fact
makes
this
case
different
and
therefore
the
government
ought
to
be
excepted
from
the
rule
of
collateral
estoppel
under
the
traditional
collateral
estoppel
doctrine.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
not
every
factual
distinction
warrants
an
exemption
from
that
doctrine,
but
only
material
facts.
and
when
dr.
mendoza
was
returned
to
the
philippines
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
the
naturalization
examiner
was
forbidden
from
naturalizing
qualified
veterans
there,
his
circumstances,
his
situation,
became
identical
to
that
of
the
veterans
involved
in
the
68
veterans
case,
and
he
suffered
the
very
same
injury
that
judge
renfrew
found
to
exist
in
the
68
veterans
case.
in
any
event,
i
bring
up
the
matter
of
the
inequity
in
this
situation
not
merely
to
remind
the
court
that
an
inequity
like
that
exists.
obviously
it
does.
but
i
hope
it
will
also
remind
the
court
that
it's--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
it
could.
but
i
think
here
we
have--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--if
a
person
did
not
apply
for
citizenship
and
other
people
were
naturalized,
it
might
be
characterized
as
an
inequity.
but
here
the
inequity
was
created
by
the
government's
on-again,
off-again
attitude
about
the
whole
filipino
war
veterans
litigation.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
he
didn't
avail
himself
in
1945
when
he
didn't
know
about
it,
sure.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
the
inequity
that
i'm
referring
to--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--he
could
have,
had
he
known,
applied
while
he
was
in
the
united
states,
that's
true,
had
he
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
he
could
have
applied
had
he
known.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i'm
sorry,
i
couldn't
hear
you.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
sure,
i
know
about
ignorance
of
the
law.
but
that's
not
the
issue
that
i
see
as
being
involved
in
this
case.
the
issue
is
that,
whether
or
not
that
factual
distinction
makes
his
case
different
or
materially
different
from
the
case
of
the
68
veterans
for
purposes
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
he
was
here...
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
he
was
here
for
part
of
the
time,
that's
true.
but
as
i
indicated,
he
didn't
know
at
that
time.
and
the
important
point,
i
believe,
is
that
he
was
in
fact
in
the
philippines
during
the
time
when
the
naturalization
examiner
was
forbidden
from
naturalizing
people.
and
that's
the
injury
that
he
suffered,
that
he
was
there
at
the
critical
time
and
therefore
he
was
in
an
identical
situation
to
that
of
the
68
veterans
in
that
particular
sense.
he
suffered
the
same
injury
that
the
68
veterans
suffered.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
right.
but
i
merely
bring
that
up
at
the
beginning,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
spend
quite
as
much
time
on
that
particular
issue,
simply
to
remind
the
court
that
it's
the
government's
inconsistent
conduct
of
this
litigation
as
much
as
judge
renfrew's
decision
in
68
veterans
which
warrants
the
application
of
collateral
estoppel
to
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
in
that
sense,
i
don't
believe
judge
renfrew's
decision
should
be
treated
as
just
another
district
court
opinion
which
we're
trying
to
blow
up
out
of
all
proportion.
i
say
that
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
68
veterans
was
the
first
case
to
raise
the
due
process
issue,
and
it
was
the
first
case
to
reach
a
court
of
appeals.
and
it
involved
68
people.
it
wasn't
just
one
veteran
coming
along
and
applying
for
naturalization.
there
were
68
people
who
were
involved
in
that
particular
case.
and
what
happened
in
that
particular
case,
the
government
comes
in,
having
won
the
hibi
case,
and
makes
the
same
arguments.
it
says
that
if
mr.
hibi
were
naturalized
and
it
said
that
if
the
68
veterans
were
naturalized,
suddenly
there
would
be
tens
of
thousands
of
applications
made
by
other
veterans
and
they
would
impose
an
intolerable
burden
on
the
nation's
immigration
system.
the
government
argued
also
that
the
ruling
in
68
veterans,
a
ruling
which
favored
68
veterans,
would
necessarily
constrain
the
government's
foreign...
the
government's
or
the
executive's
power
to
conduct
foreign
policy.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that's
correct.
they
each
filed
separate
petitions
for
naturalization.
but
of
course,
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
i
think
everyone
expected
that
68
veterans
would
not
end
at
the
district
court
level,
and
that
it
probably
would
come
back
to
this
court,
because
after
all,
as
mr.
geller
reminds
you,
the
government
won
the
hibi
case,
but
had
every
incentive
at
that
time
to
fully
litigate
the
issues
that
were
raised
in
68
veterans.
they
knew
that
there
were
others
who
were
going
to
apply.
they
were
raising
what
they
called
significant
issues.
they
won
in
the
hibi
case.
and
they
had
every
incentive
to
go
ahead
and
litigate
that,
that
particular
issue.
and
yet,
on
the
eve
of
oral
argument
in
the
ninth
circuit
they
suddenly
dropped
their
appeal.
and
they
tell
us
now
that
they
dropped
it
because
they
discovered
that
the
numbers
of
veterans
who
might
apply
wasn't
really
very
large
after
all,
and
also
that
these
veterans
as
a
matter
of
fairness
should
have
been
naturalized
back
in
1945.
and
of
course,
as
mr.
geller
reminded
you,
that
would
have
been
in
keeping
with
the
government's
policy
of
compassion
and
amnesty
to
refugees
who
were
then
coming
to
the
united
states
by
the
tens
of
thousands.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes,
he
did.
and
it's
that
same
administration
which
reversed
that
policy
and
decided
to
contest
the
naturalization
of
others
as
well
soon
after
the
case
of
68
veterans
were
decided
and
the
others
were
grandfathered
into
that.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that
the
reversal?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
i
think
ordinarily,
in
ordinary
circumstances,
i
don't
think
the
government's
decision
to
change
its
mind
about
something
would
warrant
an
estoppel.
i
think
it
does
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
because
the
government
had
already
won
the
hibi
case--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
either,
although
obviously
i
think
they're
being
unfair
here.
but
i'm
saying
that
when
a...
and
this
is
the
gist,
it
seems
to
me,
of
collateral
estoppel:
did
a
party
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
an
issue
in
the
first
case?
did
it
avail
itself
of
that
opportunity?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
the
change
of
policy
i
don't
think
is--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--unfair
or
irrelevant
in
that
sense.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
if
that
were
all
that
was
concerned
in
a
particular
case.
and
as
i
said,
i
think
there
is
more
to
it
in
this
particular
case
because
of
the
numbers
of
people,
the
foreseeability
of
future
litigation,
the
fact
that
the
government
had
won
in
this
case
already...
in
the
other
case.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
i
read
about
it.
i'm
not
sure
i
recognize
it.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
offensive
obviously
is
a
much
newer
sort
of
theory.
but
i
think
they
both
rest
ultimately
on
this
question
of
fairness,
and
fairness
goes
to
such
matters
as
whether
or
not
the
party
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate,
were
the
issues
the
same
in
the
prior
case.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
even
though
the
parties
are
different,
sure.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
sure
he
is.
he's
given
an
opportunity
to
litigate
that
question.
but
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
argument
about
the
identity
of
parties
that
mr.
geller
has
raised,
because
if
he's
insisting
that
collateral
estoppel
will
not
apply
unless
there
is
an
identity
of
parties,
then
it
seems
to
me
he
would
revert
back
to
the
mutuality
rule,
which
this
court
abandoned
in
parklane
and
the
blonder-tongue
cases.
and
unless
that
happens,
if
you're
going
to
insist
on
identity
of
parties,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
situation
where
another
opponent
can
come
in
and
raise
the
doctrine
of
offensive
collateral
estoppel
as
dr.
mendoza
wishes
to
do
in
this
situation.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
i
think
it's
unfair
for
the
government
to
have
one
policy
with
respect
to
certain
veterans
and
to
say,
okay,
you
people
can
be
naturalized,
and
to
take
people
like
dr.
mendoza
and
to
say,
sorry,
you
can't
be
naturalized,
although
the
circumstances
are
virtually
identical.
in
that
sense
i
do
think
there's
a
fairness
argument
to
be
made.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
two
different
people?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no,
because,
first
of
all,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--pardon?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
would
say
he
does
not
have
an
estoppel
argument
there.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
really
not
going
that
far.
i'm
saying
on
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
case
is
unique,
and
we
have
the
situation
where--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--category
two,
who
have
applications
pending
at
the
present
time?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
okay.
as
far
as
i
know...
and
i
only
have
unofficial
information
based
on
some
informal
conversations
with
people
in
the
immigration
office
in
san
francisco,
where
i
practice
law...
there
are
approximately
230
applications
pending,
i
am
told.
of
course,
san
francisco
is
the
center.
this
is
the
place
where
all
of
this
litigation
really
started
and
where
most
of
the
litigation
is
taking
place.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
wouldn't
say
all,
obviously.
but
there's...
for
geographical
reasons,
obviously,
most
of
them
are
in
california,
and
the
litigation
started
there
and
most
of
the
people
who
are
applying
are
there.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
litigation
has
been
going
on
now
for
15
years
or
so,
since
the
hibi
case
began.
so
if
there
are
only
a
couple
hundred
people
who
have
applied,
the
numbers
who
are
going
to
apply
ultimately
can't
be
very
large.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no,
i
don't.
i
think
obviously
the
stare
decisis
would
be
the
ordinary
rule.
it's
not
an
absolute.
i
don't
believe
the
restatement
talks
of
stare
decisis
as
an
absolute
when
applied
to
the
government.
but
i
think
when
the
government
has
changed
its
position
and
wants
to
come
back
into
court,
the
least
it
could
do
would
be
to
come
forward
with
evidence
or
a
showing
that
there
really
is
some
significant
recurring
national
issue
that
makes
the
government
different.
and
after
all,
that
really
is
why
the
government
should
be
treated
differently
than
private
litigants.
it's
supposed
to
represent
the
public
interest.
if
that's
so,
then
at
least
it
should
come
to
court
and
say,
look,
there
really
is
a
public
interest
here.
i
can't
see
how
they've
done
that
in
this
case.
they
come
in
and
they
talk
about
how
this
decision
would
impinge
upon
the
president's
powers
and
how
it
would
impinge
upon
the
power
of
congress
to
provide
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
but
it
should
be
obvious
that
judge
renfrew's
decision
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
limited
by
the
extraordinary
facts
of
this
case.
it'
a
really
extraordinary
set
of
circumstances,
because
this
circumstance
is
simply
not
going
to
happen
again,
realistically.
the
government
is
talking
about
a
recurring
national...
a
recurring
issue
of
national
significance.
how
can
that
be
when
the
facts
are
not
going
to
recur?
it
seems
to
me
that
in
any
future
litigation
judge
renfrew's
decision
can
easily
be
distinguished
on
the
facts.
i
think
the
same
is
true
about
the
government's
argument
that
somehow
judge
renfrew's
decision
stands
for
the
proposition
that
courts
may
impinge
upon
the
congressional
power
to
provide
a
rule
of
naturalization.
that's
not
what
judge
renfrew's
decision
really
stands
for,
and
of
course
it
really
amazes
me
that
the
government
would
come
in
here
with
that
sort
of
argument
when
it
thwarted
the
will
of
congress
itself
back
in
1945
when
it
refused
to
let
these
people
be
naturalized
who
should
have
been
naturalized
under
that
law.
but
judge
renfrew's
decision
in
any
event
doesn't
stand
for
that
proposition.
all
it
stands
for
is
the
proposition
that
when
a
person
has
been
denied
an
opportunity
to
apply
for
naturalization
under
a
law
that
congress
provided
for
that
person's
benefit
and
that
denial
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process,
then
no
statute
can
stand
as
a
bar
to
his
naturalization
anyway.
so
it
seems
to
me
the
government
has
failed
totally
in
coming
before
this
court
and
establishing
that
there
really
is
an
issue
that
would
be
of
recurring
national
significance.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
government
is
to
be
treated
as
different
from
private
litigants,
it
has
to
be
treated
that
way
because
of
the
public
interest
that
it
represents.
if
it
can't
come
forward
with
a
real
public
interest
argument,
then
why
not
apply
collateral
estoppel
to
the
government?
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
no.
he
didn't
know
about
it
then,
either.
he
testified
that
he
didn't
learn
about
it
until
he
heard
of
the
68
veterans
litigation.
and
of
course,
it's
ironic,
of
course,
too,
because
dr.
mendoza
would
be
a
citizen
today
if
he
had
only
filed
his
petition
a
few
days
earlier.
it
was
just
as
the
68
were
being
naturalized
that
dr.
mendoza
was
filing
his
naturalization
application.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
sure.
that's
true
on
the
facts,
justice
marshall.
i
can't
argue
with
that.
that's
true.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
look
back
at
conditions
that
existed
at
that
time.
it
was
just
after
the
war.
he
was
sent
here.
he
had
been
in
a
prison
camp,
in
the
japanese
prison
camp
for
years
in
the
philippines.
after
the
liberation,
he
rejoins
the
american
army.
he's
sent
here
for
some
training.
he's
sent
to
someplace
in
pennsylvania
and
he's
there
for
a
few
months.
i
mean,
it's
only
reasonable
and
understandable
that
he's
not
going
to
know
about
the
law
that
exists
at
that--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--but
they
can't
get
to
this
country.
filipinos
at
that
time,
your
honor,
were
subject
to
an
immigration
quota
that
limited
the
number
to
100
people
each
year
who
could
come
to
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
it
was
an
absolute
impossibility.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
i
don't
know
whether
he
knew
that
or
not.
but
whether
he'd
known
it
or
not,
he
couldn't
have
gotten
here.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
don't
think
he
knew
any
part
of
it.
i
mean,
he
didn't
know
anything--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
his
presence
in
the
united
states
and
whether
he
knew
about
it
or
not
distinguishes
his
case
materially
from
the
case
of
the
68
veterans.
and
for
the
reasons
which
i've
mentioned
earlier,
i
don't
think
it
does,
because
he
was
in
the
philippines
during
that
time,
that
critical
time
when
the
examiner
was
forbidden
from
naturalizing
people,
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
judge
renfrew
made
his
decision
in
68
veterans.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
in
effect,
he
was
in
identical
circumstances.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
other
argument
that
mr.
geller
is
making
here,
and
that
is
that
if
dr.
mendoza
is
naturalized
the
government
somehow
is
going
to
have
to
flood
the
courts
with
unnecessary
appeals.
well,
i
think
that
that
argument
is
as
exaggerated
as
the
argument
the
government
has
made
about
the
numbers
of
people
who
would
apply
when
they
were
arguing
the
hibi
case
and
when
they
were
arguing
68
veterans.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
belief
that
if
dr.
mendoza
is
naturalized
as
an
american
citizen,
somehow
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
unable
to
recognize
what
cases
to
appeal
and
what
cases
not
to
appeal.
in
fact,
the
considerations
that
he
says
himself
he
takes
into
account
in
deciding
whether
to
appeal
or
not
would
be
similar
to
those
issues
he
would
have
to
take
into
account
in
deciding
whether
there's
a
danger
of
estoppel
if
an
appeal
is
not
taken.
for
example,
the
significance
of
the
issues,
the
foreseeability
of
future
litigation,
whether
the
stakes
in
the
two
cases
were
virtually
the
same,
or
whether
there's
some
overriding
public
interest
involved.
those
are
the
same
considerations,
of
course,
that
this
court
held
in
parklane
were
the
kinds
of
considerations
that
the
trial
court
should
take
into
account
in
the
application
of
offensive
collateral
estoppel.
in
response
to
what
justice
o'connor
requested,
it
seems
to
me
it's
difficult
also
to
think
of
situations
where
the
government
is
going
to
be
estopped
very
often,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
they
will
have
the
public
interest.
my
point
is
simply
that
they
have
not
established
a
public
interest
in
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
well,
i
can
only
say
that
i'm
not
sure
the
government
has
made
that
particular
argument.
but
i
would
suggest
that
it's
not
the
kind
of
issue
of
enduring
national
significance
that
the
government
is
talking
about
when
it
says
this
case
ought
to
be
relitigated
on
the
merits.
i
think
they're
talking
about
this
question
of
the
effect
of
what
judge
renfrew
decided
in
68
veterans
with
respect
to
the
powers,
the
executive
powers
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
impingement
on
the
congress'
authority
to
provide
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
believe
he's
on
a
trip
to
the
philippines.
he's
taking
a
vacation
there.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
yes,
he
is.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
in
the
los
angeles
area.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
practicing
medicine?
no,
he's
not.
he's
75
years
old
and
he's
retired.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
i
hope
i'll
say
that
when
i'm
75,
too.
i
think
i'd
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
argument
that
mr.
geller
made
with
respect
to
the
moser
exception
that's
discussed
in
the
montana
case
in
this
matter
of
not
only
identity
of
parties,
but
the
applicability
of
that
moser
exception
to
unmixed
questions
of
law
that
are
based
upon
a
different
demand.
in
my
opinion,
moser...
that
moser
exception
really
ought
to
be
interpreted,
as
i
think
the
court
interpreted
it
in
montana,
in
light
of
the
purpose
and
objectives
of
that
particular
exception
or
that
particular
rule.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
purpose
and
objective
of
that
particular
rule
was
simply
that
a
rule
of
law
should
not
be
applied
to
facts
and
circumstances
that
are
different,
significantly
different
from
facts
and
circumstances
that
led
to
adoption
of
the
rule
in
the
first
place.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
constitutional
doctrine
would
be
frozen,
development
of
the
law
would
be
hindered,
because
the
law
couldn't
adapt
to
changing
times
and
changing
circumstances.
but
in
my
opinion
there's
no
danger
of
freezing
the
law
in
this
particular
case
when
the
facts
are
identical,
and
if
the
facts
are
identical
or
substantially
identical
in
time
and
subject
matter
there
really
isn't
this
danger
that
the
court
was
talking
about
in
moser
and
montana.
certainly
that's
no
danger
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
when
the
factual...
the
historical
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
rule
of
law
by
judge
renfrew
in
his
opinion,
those
historical
facts
are
really
identical,
and
there's
no
danger
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
moser
and
montana
of
freezing
constitutional
doctrine.
that's
all
i
meant
when
i
said
in
our
brief
that
this
term
"different
demand"
that's
used
in
moser
doesn't
mean
that
a
demand
is
different
simply
because
another
litigant
comes
along.
it
seems
to
me
if
that
were
the
case
then
the
moser
exception
is
never
going
to
apply,
because
there's
always
going
to
be
a
different
party
coming
along.
it
seems
to
me
a
demand
is
different
when
the
historical
facts
of
the
second
case
are
substantially
different,
are
substantially
unrelated
from
the
facts
of
the
first
case,
because
if
they
are
that
would
thwart
the
purpose
or
objective
of
the
rule
in
the
first
place.
but
when
they're
not
substantially
unrelated,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
objective
is
satisfied.
i
think
as
long
as
i
have
a
moment
or
two
left,
i
would
like
to
mention
just
one
or
two
other
points
with
respect
to
the
hibi
case
on
the
issue
here.
it
seems
to
me
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
issue
preclusion,
and
the
due
process
issue
that
was
raised
in
68
veterans
and
in
dr.
mendoza's
case
was
not
an
issue
that
was
addressed
by
the
court
in
hibi.
obviously,
the
facts
were
pretty
much
the
same.
but
the
fact
that
the
facts
were
the
same
doesn't
mean
that
the
issue
was
the
same.
the
only
issue
that
was
addressed
by
the
court
was
the
equitable
estoppel
issue
and
not
the
due
process
issue.
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
what
this
court
said
about
hibi
in
the
miranda
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
ins
versus
miranda.
in
ins
versus
miranda,
this
court
recognized
that
what
the
government
did
here
was
an
error,
a
clear
error,
in
failing
to
allow
the
naturalization
examiner
to
carry
out
his
duty
in
the
philippines
in
1945.
obviously,
the
court
didn't
feel
that
that
error
rose
to
the
level
of
affirmative
misconduct
which
would
trigger
the
application
of
equitable
estoppel.
but
this
concept
of
affirmative
misconduct
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
of
due
process.
since
equitable
estoppel
was
the
only
issue
that
was
addressed
and
adjudicated
by
this
court
in
hibi,
it
seems
to
me
hibi
does
not
have
any
preclusive
effect
on
the
case
here.
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
whether
judge
renfrew
was
aware
of
that?
yes,
he
was.
that
was
a
matter
of
the
record,
although
he
accepted
the
government's--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
burger,
is
that
that
may
have
been
an
important
consideration
in
1945.
in
judge
renfrew's
opinion,
and
obviously
in
my
opinion,
that
was
no
longer
an
important
issue
in
1969,
1970,
and
so
on.
that
happened
20
years
ago.
our
relationship
with
the
philippines
government
is
certainly
not
going
to--
mr.
donald
l.
ungar
--well,
but
i
don't
think
the
issue
in
1945
or
1946
would
have
been
an
issue
of
fairness.
the
issue
in
1945
and
1946
would
be
whether
the
attorney
general
had
the
power
to
do
what
he
did.
the
unfairness
issue
comes
in
only
on
the
collateral
estoppel
question,
which
is
the
specific
issue
in
the
mendoza
case.
one
last
point.
mr.
geller
makes
a
point
of
saying
that
there
were
certain
issues
that
were
not
addressed
in
68
veterans
which
were
addressed
in
the
mendoza
case,
and
he
refers
to
laches
and
the
effect
of
section
1421(e)
of
title
8.
well,
i've
re-examined
the
record
in
68
veterans.
it
may
be
true
that
laches
was
not
argued
at
the
district
court
level.
there's
nothing
in
the
papers
that
i've
looked
at
which
suggests
that
it
was
argued,
although
it
may
have
been
at
oral
argument.
in
any
event,
laches
was
not
argued
by
the
government
in
the
mendoza
case.
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
kind
of
ironic
for
the
government
to
make
that
argument
when
it
didn't
raise
laches
in
the
mendoza
case.
and
you
can
look
at
the
record
yourself
on
that
point,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
litonjua
case
which
is
now
pending
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
where
the
government
points
out
that
in
the
recommendation
of
the
immigration
examiner
to
the
district
court
there's
no
mention
of
laches.
as
for
section
1421(e),
of
course,
that
was
what
this
case
was
all
about,
and
the
question
was
whether
1421(e)
barred
the
68
veterans
from
being
naturalized.
and
that
certainly
was
raised
in
68
veterans,
as
it
was
raised
here.
and
evidence
of
that
fact,
of
course,
is
in
the
government's
brief
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
68
veterans,
where
they
raise
this
issue
of
1421(e).
obviously,
they
wouldn't
be
raising
that
issue
on
appeal
for
the
first
time.
they
would
have
had
to
raise
in
the
district
court.
and
as
i
said,
that's
the
whole
argument
on
the
merits,
is
whether
or
not
1421(e)
ought
to
bar
the
veterans
from
being
naturalized.
thank
you
very
much.
