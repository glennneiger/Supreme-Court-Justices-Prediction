unknown
speaker
did
the
act
require
the
united
states
to
send
examiners
outside
the
continental
limits
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
and
you
maintain
that
it
was
required
that
the
united
states
do
that
under
the
act,
not
permitted
but
required?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
why
did
the
government
remove
its
examiners
from
the
philippines
in
'46?
unknown
speaker
what
role,
if
any,
did
the
position
of
the
philippine
leadership,
the
government,
have
to
do
with
this
interruption
of
service?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
i
interrupt?
in
essence,
what
you
did
is
accept
category
one
of
judge
renfrew's
decision
and
not
category
two.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us,
just
out
of
curiosity,
how
many
people
are
in
the
respective
categories?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that.
but
i
mean
in
the...
how
many
people
are
we
talking
about
now
and
how
many
do
you
let
in
under
category
one?
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
but
then
the
commissioner
castillo
testified
that
there
were
only
about
100
actually.
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
questioning
the
wisdom
of
the
government's
decision.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
curious
if
we
knew,
as
between
category
one
and
category
two,
what
the
relative
sizes
of
the
categories
were.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
when
you
use
the
term
"collateral
estoppel"
you
mean
the
doctrine
that
goes
beyond
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
issue
preclusion.
but
now,
if
one
reads
the
montana
decision
of
this
court
as
being
a
holding
that
the
government
was
in
privity
the
first
time,
now,
that
would
be
collateral
estoppel
but
still
as
between
the
same
two
parties
because
it's
a
different
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
wasn't
it
res
judicata
in
montana,
if
you're
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
refer
to
that,
what
the
attorney
general
had
done,
do
you
mean
his
withdrawing--
unknown
speaker
--the
examiners
for
nine
months?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
do
you
think
montana
versus
the
united
states
was
correctly
decided?
unknown
speaker
in
looking
at
your
brief,
it
appeared
that
you
might
be
asking
us
to
make
some
modifications
in
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
still
accept
the
principles
in
montana
and
disagree
with
the
result.
unknown
speaker
as
distinct
from
a
res
judicata
situation?
unknown
speaker
you
would
certainly
be
precluded
from--
unknown
speaker
--raising
legal
issues
that
might
have
been
raised
in
the
first
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
strictly
a
res
judicata
sense,
if
it
were
the
same
litigant
on
both
sides
and
the
same
claim,
you
would
also
be
precluded
from
relitigating
a
legal
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
rule
applies
to
when
the
solicitor
general
confesses
error?
i
hope
it
doesn't
apply
to
that.
unknown
speaker
it'd
be
barred
from
forever
raising
that
point?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
i
know
you
don't
have
figures
on
how
many
people
are
in
this
category
two.
can
you
tell
me,
are
there
any
other
cases
pending?
how
many
other
cases
like
this
are
there
pending
in
the
court,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
second
circuit.
how
many
people
were
involved
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
so
as
far
as
the
public
records
go,
there
are
really
perhaps
only
a
handful
of
people
that
are
affected
by
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand
your
legal
contention.
unknown
speaker
because
this
is...
they're
rather
senior
citizens
for
the
most
part
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
since
you
raise
that,
doesn't
he,
or
you
to
this
court,
have
an
obligation
to
explain
why
he
didn't
make
an
application
in
the
six
months
when
he
was
in
this
country
studying
medicine?
unknown
speaker
but
that
really
goes
to
the
merits
of
your
client's
claim,
doesn't
it,
rather
than
whether
or
not
the
government
should
be
estopped
from
litigating
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
same
inequity
apply
when
nobody
applies
for
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
same
inequity
apply?
unknown
speaker
plus
the
fact
that
he
didn't
avail
himself.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
so
i
have
trouble
with
the
inequity
there.
unknown
speaker
it
was
available,
a
remedy
was
available.
unknown
speaker
so
he
could
have
applied,
not
if
he
knew.
he
could
have
applied.
unknown
speaker
you
know
about
ignorance
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
you
know
about
ignorance
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
it
go
to
the
prejudice
that
he
suffered,
whether
he
suffered
prejudice,
which
is
an
element
of
any
due
process
claim?
and
it
could
well
be
that
your
client
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
absence
of
the
naturalization
officer
from
the
philippine
islands
because
he
was
here.
so
obviously
it
could
be
quite
different--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
ungar,
i'm
sure
you
must
be
aware
that
the
court's
primary
interest
in
this
case
is
in
the
collateral
estoppel
issue,
not
in
the
individual,
its
impact
in
the
individual
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ungar,
was
68
veterans
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
just
the
68?
unknown
speaker
he
said
it
was
that
administration's
policy.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
that
reversal
alone
would
estop
the
government,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
of
that
policy?
unknown
speaker
you're
just
saying,
you're
saying
then
that
the
government
itself
may
be
estopped
if
it's
too
unfair?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
change
of
policy
is
irrelevant
in
that
context.
unknown
speaker
it's
irrelevant
in
terms
of
collateral
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
for
the
purposes
of
collateral
estoppel,
that
change
of
policy
argument
is
just
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ungar,
your
client
is
relying
on
offensive
estoppel.
do
you
recognize
a
difference
between
offensive
and
defensive
collateral
estoppel?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
the
parties
are
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
there's
no
mutuality,
as
i
take
it
there
wasn't
here,
do
you
think
that
your
client
really
has
a
fairness
argument?
i
thought
that
when
you
get
beyond
mutuality
the
argument
really
was
it
saves
the
time
of
the
courts.
but
certainly
your
client
is
being
given
an
opportunity
to
litigate.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
only
point
was
that
when
you
do
depart
from
mutuality
i
don't
think
you
have
the
same
fairness
argument
that
you
have
in...
you
have
basically
a
judicial
economy
argument.
i
mean,
it's
not
unfair
to
dr.
mendoza
to
require
him
to
litigate
his
claim
once,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ungar,
let's
look
at
prosecutorial
discretion
for
the
moment.
a
prosecutor
refuses
to
prosecute
a
man
for
burglary,
and
the
next
month
he
does
prosecute
a
man
for
burglarizing
the
same
place.
unknown
speaker
yes.
does
he
have
any
estoppel?
unknown
speaker
you're
sure
he
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
you're
sure
he
does
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
true
that
whether
or
not
the
government
appeals
the
case
is
determined
by
the
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
doesn't
appeal
one
case
he
can't
appeal
any
other?
unknown
speaker
you're
getting
kind
of
close,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
how
unique
is
it?
how
many
people
are
there
in
this
same
category?
unknown
speaker
the
category
of
dr.
mendoza.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that's
where
all
the
filipinos
are?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ungar,
the
american
law
institute
has
suggested
that
the
only
principle
that
we
should
apply
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
the
government
is
a
party,
is
stare
decisis.
i
take
it
you
think
that
we
should
apply
the
same
policy
when
the
government
is
a
party
as
between
private
litigants?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
the
facts?
i
don't
recall
from
the
papers.
i
understand
the
doctor
testified
that
he
didn't
know
about
the
law
while
he
was
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
did
he
testify
that
he
found
out
about
the
law
after
he
got
back
to
the
philippines?
unknown
speaker
it's
his
position
that
he
was
here
for
six
months
and
he
never
thought
of
inquiring
as
to
whether
he
could
become
a
citizen
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
that
your
argument
tells
me
is
that
if
i
had
all
of
that
i
would
try
to
find
a
way
to
get
to
this
country,
where
those
things
don't
happen.
unknown
speaker
did
he
know
that?
unknown
speaker
did
he
know
that?
unknown
speaker
while
he
knows
one
part
of
it,
he
doesn't
know
the
other
part?
unknown
speaker
he
knows
one
part
of
the
immigration
law,
but
he
doesn't
know
another
part.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
where
it
helps
my
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
grant
estoppel
here,
the
fact
that
"he
didn't
know
about
it".
unknown
speaker
he
was
a
part
of
the
68
case?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
interest
is
the
concern
that
some
might
have
with
the
use
of...
the
application
of
offensive
collateral
estoppel
as
a
principle
against
the
government.
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
certainly
clearly
stands
for
that,
and
perhaps
that
motivates
a
re-examination.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ungar,
where
is
the
doctor
now?
unknown
speaker
is
he
living
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
practicing
now?
unknown
speaker
that's
young.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
that
the
judge
was
aware
that
the
philippine
government
had
requested
the
united
states
to
terminate
its
activities?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
seen
to
carry
much
weight
with
him,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
the
united
states
was
being
unfair
when
it
responded
to
the
request
of
an
ally
and
friendly
country?
unknown
speaker
does
it
not
bear
on
the
argument
of
unfairness
in
1945
and
1946?
that's
when
the
action
of
the
government
must
be
judged,
must
it
not?
