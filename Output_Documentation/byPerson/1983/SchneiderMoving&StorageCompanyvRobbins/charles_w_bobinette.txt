mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
rule
of
the
eighth
circuit
has
adopted
a
position
of
a
presumption
against
arbitration,
and
allows
the
trustees
to
independently
sue
the
employer
and
litigation
the
meaning
and
the
intent
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
further,
it
is
to
the
exclusion
of
the
union,
and
will
not
be
binding
on
the
union
nor
its
membership.
the
effects
on
the
typical
labor
management
relationships
as
a
result
of
this
rule
seem
obvious.
first
of
all,
it
violates
the
intents
of
the
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
union
and
the
employer.
secondly,
it
invades
the
traditional
province
of
the
union
and
the
employer
to
collectively
bargain
and
settle
their
disputes
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
is.
third,
it
subjects
the
employer
to
inconsistent
obligations,
and
possibly
very
heavy
expenses
for
having
to
litigate
this
particular
issue
in
a
multiplicity
of
forums,
and
last
but
not
least,
it
serves
a
disservice
to
the
judiciary
by
forcing
the
courts
to
hear
traditional
labor
disputes
which
are
well
suited
for
an
arbitrator
to
decide,
and
which
additionally
are
neither
binding
on
the
co-signatories
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
union
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
well,
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
determining
what
the
intents
of
the
parties
are.
if
you
look
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
the
wishes
and
the
desires
of
the
settlers
to
the
trust,
you
look
at
the
intents
of
the
settlers
in
establishing
that
particular
trust.
what
were
the
intents
of
the
union
and
the
employer
at
the
time
they
entered
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
it
has
been
some
bother,
particularly
to
the
eighth
circuit,
that
the
trustees
have
no
direct
access
to
the
arbitration
clause.
that
is,
they
can
not
flip
it
on
and
then
proceed
into
arbitration.
i
would
suggest
the
fact
that
they
are
specifically
not
mentioned
as
parties
who
can
trigger
the
arbitration
provision
is
an
indication
that
the
parties,
the
union
and
the
employer,
never
intended
to
allow
them
to
involve
themselves
in
interpretive
disputes.
given
that,
and
then
comparing
it
to
the
language
contained
within
the
trust
indentures,
the
language
in
the
trust
indentures
i
believe
presupposes
that
the
debt
or
the
obligation
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
already
established,
and
that
really
what
is
being
allowed
under
the
trust
indenture
is
the
right
to
collect
delinquencies,
and
nothing
more
than
that.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
reasonable
to
determine,
that
it
was
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
resolve
all
interpretive
disputes
under
the...
or
through
the
grievance
and
the
arbitration
provisions.
these
risks
that
i
have
mentioned
are
neither
mandated
nor
warranted
by
the
legislative
history,
nor
by
the
language
or
the
structure
of
those
federal
statutes
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
employee
benefits.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
it
is
very
well
possible.
i
think
that
by
allowing
the
trustees
to
litigate
independently
of
the
union...
we
had
a
motion
to
add
the
union
in
on
this
case,
and
we
never
got
to
that
point.
certainly
they
never--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--no,
no,
the
district
court
never
ruled
on
that.
it
deferred
to
arbitration
before
getting
to
that
particular
issue
that
we
raised.
but
to
answer
your
question,
it
is
very,
very
possible
that--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--well,
that
issue
was...
yes,
we
did--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--well,
if--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--it
would
be
our
position
that
they
are
a
necessary
party
to
this
action,
and
that
would
certainly
begin
to
take
care
of
some
of
these
possibilities
of
inconsistencies
and
multiplicity
of
forums.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
well,
waiting
for
the
decision
first,
but
ultimately,
right.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
that
will
be
the
next
question.
but
to
answer
the
first
question
that
you
had,
it
is
very,
very
conceivable
that
allowing
the
union...
excuse
me,
the
trustees
to
independently
litigate
simply
encourages
the
union
to
sit
back
and
to
wait
to
see
what
happens.
they
will
incur
no
costs.
they
will
incur
no
risk.
all
they
have
to
do
is
see
how
the
action
turned
out.
if
they
don't
like
it,
then
they
can
arbitrate
it,
or
maybe
they
can
strike.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
under
the
court's
decision
in
w.r.
grace
versus
local
759,
i
would
think
that--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--the
arbitrator
will
take
evidence,
and
listen
to
it,
and
attempt
to--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--well,
just
as
the
federal
court
judge
has
no
right
to
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
the
arbitrator,
i
think
that
we
just
get
into
the
flip-flop
of
that.
if
the
federal
court
has
no
right
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
arbitrator,
then
i
think
the
arbitrator
could
say,
i
may
make
whatever
decision
i
wish
to
as
long
as
i
draw
it
from
the
essence
of
the
contract.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
no,
your
honor.
a
serious
question
does
arise,
though,
that
if
the
trustees
do
lose
in
this
particular
case,
what
in
fact
happens?
it
is
very
conceivable
that
certainly
that
does
not
bar
the
interest
of
the
union
or
of
the
employer
in
this
particular...
excuse
me,
the
union
or
the
employees
in
this
particular
case.
some
ten
years
down
the
line
it
may
well
be
that
an
individual
who
has
determined
through
that
litigation
not
to
be
covered
will
file
a
claim
for
benefits.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
trustees
will
be
foreclosed
from
coming
back
against
the
employer
because
that
issue
would
already
have
been
litigated.
any
opportunity
for
recoupment
of
those
benefits
will
have
been
lost
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes,
your
honor.
making
them
a
necessary
party
only
gets
halfway
there,
though.
that
protects
the
questions
of
multiplicity.
the
question
that
comes
back
to
it
is
when
you've
got
the
union
and
the
employer
involved,
don't
the
union
and
employer
have
a
right
to
have
their
bargain
honored,
and
could
then
the
union
and
the
employer--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
could
have
specifically
provided
for
the
trustees
being
able
to
arbitrate
i
think
is
a
question.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
i'm
sorry?
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
correct.
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i'm
just
saying
that
had
they
included
that
opportunity
to
arbitrate,
which
would
in
your
mind
make
it
much
more
clear
that
they
wanted
them
to
arbitrate,
i
doubt
seriously
whether
or
not
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
i
know
of
none.
the
only
limitation
that
might
be
imposed
is
that
which
i
infer
from
the
court's
decision
in
nlrb
versus
amex
coal,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
these
trustees
should
be
involved
at
all
in
the
question
of
settlement
of
grievances,
and
in
answering
the
question
of
justice
o'connor,
what
i
was
attempting
to
allude
to
is,
i
don't
think
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
trigger
the
arbitration
clause,
because
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--i
think
there
are
some
serious
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
involvement
in
the
settlement
of
these
types
of
disputes
is
alien
to
their
fiduciary
duties,
and
the
way
in
which
they
conduct
themselves.
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
they
should
have
asked
the
company
to
arbitrate
the
issue,
and
that
the
company
would
trigger
the...
excuse
me.
they
should
have
asked--
mr.
charles
w.
bobinette
--the
union
to
arbitrate,
and
the
union
would
go
in
and
arbitrate
those
particular
issues
if
they
felt
as
though
the
interpretation
of
the
trustees
was
meritorious.
the
basis
on
which
the
eighth
circuit
has
made
its
decision,
this
is
an
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress
to
not...
to
separate
the
trustees
from
the
dependents
of
the
union.
this
is
drawn
from
302(c)(5).
a
review
of
the
history,
of
the
legislative
history
indicates
the
concerns
of
congress
were
with
bribery
and
extortion
and
illegal
activities.
to
the
contrary,
the
eighth
circuit
was
concerned
with
the
idea
that
the
union
in
good
faith
would
not
decide
to
otherwise
arbitrate
a
meritorious
dispute.
i
don't
think
that
the
concerns
of
congress
were
the
same
concerns
that
the
eighth
circuit
had.
specfically,
i
think
the
construction
is
supported
by
looking
at
the
text
of
section
302(c)(5)
and
indicating
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
conditions
for
setting
up
these
trusts
which
in
any
way
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
alter
the
relationship
between
the
union
and
the
employer
in
terms
of
settling
its
own
disputes.
most
recently,
in
1980,
congress
adopted
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
amendments
act
specifically
under
section
515,
and
under
that
section
it
allows
the
trustees
to
institute
suit
for
delinquent
contributions.
we
have
submitted
that
these
underlying
contract
disputes
are
not
the
kind
of
delinquency
actions
that
congress
had
in
mind,
nor
are
they
simple
collection
actions
that
was
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
arbitration
is
integrally
related
to
determining
the
extent
of
the
promise
provided
for
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
therefore
they
are
defenses
which
are
in
fact
very
much
related
to
the
question
of
the
obligation
of
the
employer
to
pay
benefits.
lastly,
the
question
that
has
to
come
up
in
a
person's
mind
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
allow
trustees
to
involve
itself
in
interpretive
disputes
under
section
515
of
erisa.
given
the
fact
that
under
this
section
it
is
mandatory
that
a
judge
impose
penalties,
damages,
double
interest
payments,
as
well
as
attorneys'
fees,
and
given
the
fact
that
congress
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
trustees
can
involve
themselves
in
interpretive
disputes,
it
raises
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
intended
employers
to
suffer
the
penalties
provided
for
under
this
section
if
they
in
good
faith
involved
themselves
in
interpretive
dispute.
thank
you.
