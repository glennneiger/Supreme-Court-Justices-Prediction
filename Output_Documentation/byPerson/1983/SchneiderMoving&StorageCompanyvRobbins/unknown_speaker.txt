unknown
speaker
what
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says
there
will
be
a
trust
agreement,
and
uses
certain
words
in
describing
the
coverage,
and
then
there
is
a
trust
agreement,
and
it
uses
the
same
words
about
coverage?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
question
about
what
the
words
mean.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
the
same
words
are
in
the
trust
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
case
in
this...
what
is
the
situation
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
just
as
though
the
trust
agreement
had
used
the
very
same
language
as
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
yates,
in
this
particular
case
involving
the
schneider
company,
as
i
understand
it,
the
union
was
decertified--
unknown
speaker
--at
the
time
the
district
court
dismissed.
now,
in
that
situation,
the
union
wouldn't
be
available
for
any
arbitration,
apparently.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
if
you
were
correct
in
your
position
that
there
is
some
duty
to
arbitrate,
does
the
union
have
a
right
if
it
got
into
a
dispute
with
the
employer
about
what
employees
were
covered
and
what
contributions
had
to
be
made,
does
the
union
have
the
right
to
waive
the
payment
of
some
of
those
moneys,
to
enter
into
an
agreement
some
way
during
the
course
of
the
collective
bargaining
period,
saying,
well,
we
understand
there
is
a
dispute,
we
will
just
give
up
the
right
to
the
payment
of
some
particular
moneys?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
i
mean,
what
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
obviously
have
the
right
to
enter
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
but
really
the
question
is
then,
is
that
fixed,
so
to
speak,
because
of
the
interplay
with
erisa,
and
so
the
union
can't
tinker
around
with
it
after
that,
or
waive
some
portion
of
the
claim,
or
something
like
that.
i
believe
that
there
are
some
distinctions
that
could
be
made,
and
the
clearest
distinction
would
be
between
vested
pension
benefits
of
employees
which
cannot
be
tinkered
with.
i
think
erisa
is
fairly
clear
there,
that
if
the
union
or
the
employer
attempt
to
tinker
with
vested
pension
benefits,
then
i
think
they
are
interfering
with
erisa's
statutory
rights.
but
here
we
are
not
talking
about
employee
benefits.
we
are
talking
about
the
funding
obligation,
what
is
the
measure
of
the
employer's
obligation
to
make
contributions
to
the
fund?
the
determination
of
employee
benefits
is
reserved
exclusively
to
the
trustees.
that
is
up
to
them
to
decide.
here,
the
employer
and
the
union
thought
they
had
a
fixed
agreement
as
to
what
the
measure
of
the
funding
obligation
would
be.
during
the
course
of
their
history,
the
issue
never
arose
as
to
whether
the
employer
was
complying
with
that
until
the
trustees
conducted
an
audit.
they
believed
that
contributions
were
due
on
behalf
of
employees
who
the
employer
thought
were
non-regular
employees.
that
has
raised
the
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
bargain
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
the
employer
and
the
union
reserved
the
right
to
resolve
those
differences
between
themselves.
once
those
issues
are
resolved,
then
the
trustees
have
a
right
to
contribute
whatever
the
fixed
obligation
is.
we
are
not
arguing
that.
mr.
yates,
is
it
not
possible
that
in
some
situations,
at
least,
that
the
question
of
coverage
would
be
identical
to
the
question
of
contribution?
in
other
words,
if
the
particular
temporary
employee
is
covered,
it
may
be
in
time
the
trustees
would
have
to
decide
whether
his
rights
are
vested
or
not.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
decided
there
was
vesting
there,
they
then
would...
you
still
say
they
would
not
have
the
right
to
say,
well,
therefore
there
must
be
contributions
made
on
behalf
of...
on
account
of
that
employee.
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
end
up
with
a
situation
in
which
the
union
and
the
company
would
agree
that
we
don't
have
to
make
contributions
on
behalf
of
employees
a,
b,
and
c,
but
yet
the
trustees
might
be
convinced
they
had
a
duty
to
pay
pensions
to
those
employees.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
does
the
company
have
the
right
to
have
the
issue
arbitrated?
unknown
speaker
the
procedures
i
read,
it
has
to
be
initiated
by
the
employee,
and
then
go
through
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
they
have
to
go
to
the
union
to
get
the
arbitration
going,
i
assume?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if
the
union
won't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bobinette,
in
these
particular
cases,
it
appeared
that
both
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
trust
indenture
referred
to
a
right
of
the
trustees
to
file
suit
for
purposes
of
enforcing
the
collection
proceedings
and
so
forth.
that
is
a
little
different
than
if
the
agreements
had
provided,
perhaps,
that
arbitration
was
required,
and
they
are
silent
on
that.
does
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
suppose
that
the
trustees
lose
this
coverage
issue
in
litigating
with
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
finishes
the
issue?
or
will
the
employer
have
to
litigate
it
in
a
possible
arbitration
procedure,
too?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
you
never
got
to
it?
was
it
denied?
unknown
speaker
then
you
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
so
what
if
it
goes
back
now?
can
you
add
the
union?
unknown
speaker
can
you
bring
the
union
in?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
down
the
line.
you
are
back
in
the
district
court
now,
aren't
you,
supposedly?
unknown
speaker
and
doing
what?
litigating
with
the
trustees.
unknown
speaker
excactly,
yes,
but
if
you
lose
here,
you
are
back
in
district
court
litigating
with
the
trustees.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
question
is,
can
you
bring
in
the
union.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
think...
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
the
union
sits
back,
they
aren't
made
a
party
to
this
suit,
you
lose
here,
go
back
to
the
district
court,
and
suppose
that
you
win
in
the
district
court
and
the
trustees
lose?
unknown
speaker
now,
then
the
union
wants
to
arbitrate,
and
it
says,
we
don't
agree
with
the
district
court.
do
you
think
they
can
arbitrate
then?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
arbitrator
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
and
say,
i
am
construing
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
according
to
the
intent
of
the
parties,
and
if
the
federal
court
decided
otherwise,
it
was
just
wrong.
is
that
what
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
both
can't
be
right,
can
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
would
be
an
argument
for
making
the
union
a
necessary
party,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but
when
the
union
and
the
employer
have
written
up
these
agreements,
and
there's
a
trust
indenture
and
it
expressly
says
the
trustees
can
sue,
i
think
it
makes
your
argument
much
tougher.
it
is
not
a
case
where
they
said
expressly
arbitration
is
required
by
the
trustees.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
maybe
that
is
not
necessary
to
answer
here,
because--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
we
don't
have
to
answer
that
in
this
case,
because
the
agreements
don't
provide
for
it
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bobinette,
can
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
would
prevent
the
companies
and
the
union
in
future
collective
bargaining
agreements
from
spelling
out
what
procedure
they
think
would
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
situation?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
the
trustees
could
be
given
the
right
to
seek
arbitration
of
a
dispute
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
they
should
have
asked
for
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
arguing
in
this
case
that
they
should
have
sought
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
the
union.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
would
say
that
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
not
have
expressly
agreed
or
that
the
dispute
in
this
case
would
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
suppose
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
said
that
the
trust
agreement
itself
will
say
that
if
there
are
arguments
about
coverage,
that
is
arbitrable
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
suppose
it
was
just
as
clear
as
it
could
be
what
the
parties
intended.
would
you
say
the
law
would
forbid
that?
unknown
speaker
yes?
unknown
speaker
your
argument,
the
way
you
were
putting
it,
sounded
as
though
you
agreed
with
the
third
circuit.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
let
me
take
it
one
step
farther.
supposing
both
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
trust
agreement...
say
that
was
properly
amended
by
whatever
procedure
you
amend
the
trust
agreement...
provided
that
a
dispute
such
as
this
should
be
submitted
by
the
trustees
to
an
arbitration
in
which
all
three
parties
might
be
heard.
unknown
speaker
would
that
violate
any
federal
statute
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
luplow--
unknown
speaker
--could
the
trustees
on
their
own
decide
that
they
want
to
delegate
their
responsibility
for
determining
these
questions
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
but
somewhat
related
question.
suppose
the
union
decided
regardless
of
what
the
trustees
thought
that
there
was
a
question
here
about
coverage,
and
they
initiated
on
their
own
an
arbitration
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
about
the
coverage
question
and
got
a
resolution
of
it.
is
it
your
position
that
the
trustees
could
say,
well,
we
don't
agree
with
that,
and
we
don't
think
the
arbitrator
was
right,
and
we're
going
to
file
suit
and
get
a
different
result?
unknown
speaker
you
think
you
can
do
that?
unknown
speaker
or
the
result
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
you
base
that
on
erisa?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
really,
then,
just
wholly
transformed
situation
where
the
trustee's
rights
are
derivative
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
under
large
parts
of
that
trust
agreement
to
where
the
trustees
are
in
the
driver's
seat
then.
they
are
no
longer
boundy
the...
they
are
no
longer
just
third
party
beneficiaries.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
don't
need...
to
win
this
case
you
don't
need...
we
don't...
you
don't
need
to
prevail
on
some
of
these
more
difficult
issues,
i
take
it.
i
take
it
if
you...
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
really
fairly
read
doesn't
preclude
your
kind
of
a
suit,
you
win.
unknown
speaker
and
we
don't
need
to
hassle
about
what
the
result
would
be
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
purported
to
interfere
with
your
access
to
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
union
does
do
it,
and
steps
in,
and
it
is
a
dispute,
and
they
reach
an
agreement
with
the
employer
that
says
no
payments
were
due,
there's
no
coverage,
and
you
don't
like
that
result,
you
think
it's
wrong
under
the
agreement.
are
you
going
to
live
with
it,
or
can
you
file
suit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
luplow,
do
you
think
the
union
is
a
necessary
party
in
the
lawsuit
below?
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
employer
get
the
union
in?
unknown
speaker
third
party
defendant?
that
means
that
there's
a
right
over,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
are
not
a
necessary
party,
they
can't
get
them
in,
and
you
are
saying
they
are
not
necessary,
and
i...
you
know,
i
just
wonder
whether
a
party
shouldn't
have
a
little
something
to
say
about
the
meaning
of
their
agreement
and
the
coverage
question.
they
are
the
people
who
wrote
the
agreement,
and
your
position
is
so
extreme
that
you
are
just
letting
the...
you
are
saying
the
parties
don't
have
anything
to
say
about
coverage.
the
trust
tail
wags
the
whole
dog
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
employer
is
going
to
have
plenty
to
say
in
this
lawsuit
about--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
win,
and
you
wouldn't...
what
if
the
union...
what
if
you
win
this
lawsuit
and
then
the
union
moves
to
intervene,
just
to
have
its
say
so
in
the
district
court
at
trial?
would
you
oppose
the
intervention
of
the
union?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it's
a
proper
party,
at
least.
unknown
speaker
but
not
a
third
party
in
the
technical
sense,
where
one
of
the
parties
is
claiming
a
right
over
against
the
third
party.
no.
unknown
speaker
they
just
intervene.
they
just
intervene
on
one
side
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
probably
they
are
going
to
intervene
on
your
side.
unknown
speaker
which
i
wouldn't
suppose
you
would
oppose.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
there
would
be
cases
in
which
the
employees
might
want
to
intervene
by
parity
of
reasoning,
and
i
take
it
they
are
not
necessarily
represented
by
the
union
insofar
as
they
are
making
claims
against
the
fund,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
would
the
individual
employees
necessarily
be
represented
by
the
union
insofar
as
they
might
assert
a
claim
to
vested
rights
in
the
fund?
you
can
have
non-member
employees--
unknown
speaker
--or
employees
of...
defunct
employers,
and
all
sorts
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
kind
of
a
suit...
what
is
the
tenor
of
your
suit
in
the
district...
you
are
taking
a
position
on
the
meaning
there,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
just
saying
like
the
executor
of
a
will
bringing
an
action
to
construe
a
will,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
why
shouldn't
your
suit
be
more
of
that
kind,
where
you
say,
here,
we
want
you
to
tell
us
what
this
language
means,
judge,
and
then
you
take
all
the
evidence
and
the
judge
decides?
unknown
speaker
why
should
you
be
taking
a
position
on
it,
if
you
are
such
fiduciaries?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
but
why
should
you
have...
why
should
you
take
one
side
or
the
other?
a
decision
of
the
court
would
relieve
you
of
the
responsibility,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
trustee
would
normally
ask
for
instructions
on
the
construction
of
a
trust,
as
justice
white
suggested.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
erisa
gave
you
that
responsibility.
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
can
i
get
an
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
and
does
it
give
you
the
responsibility
to
take
care
and
dispose
of
that
money
and
be
responsible
for
it?
unknown
speaker
you
also
have
a
duty
to
collect
it,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
when
you
think
of
it...
you've
got
a
duty
to
collect.
unknown
speaker
but
the
discharge
of
that
responsibility
doesn't
always
require
that
you
come
down
on
the
side
of
aggrandisement
of
the
trust,
does
it?
i
mean,
just
getting
an
instruction
from
a
court
one
way
or
the
other
would
discharge
the
responsibility.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
their
position.
they
are
saying
that
they
don't
read
the
agreement
the
way...
they
don't
say
they
have
a
right
to
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
ask
a
court
to
do
that,
as
i
understood
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
they
can
take
the
position
that
this
particular
employee
is
in
fact
covered
even
though
the
union
has
said
otherwise,
but
that
is
based
on
how
they
read
the
agreement,
not
a
right
to
amend
the
agreement,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
in
this
case
that
the
union
disagrees
with
the
position
taken
by
the
trustees?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
shouldn't
say
that
the
trustees
are
attempting
to
take
a
position
contrary
to
the
understanding
of
both
parties.
after
all,
what
their
suit
is
going
to
end
up,
if
you
lose
this
case,
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial,
and
the
question
is
going
to
turn
about
what
did
the
parties
intend
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
going
to
really
find
out
just
in
a
different
forum
what
your
client
and
the
union
meant.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
yates,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
you
from
calling
up
the
union
and
saying,
do
you
agree
with
the
trustees'
reading
of
this
contract?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
did
that,
you
told
the
judge
you
both
agreed,
that
might
be
a
pretty
good
defense.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
they
would
litigate
it,
but
you
would
then
let
the
judge
know
how
the
union
felt.
