mr.
russell
n.
luplow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
respondent's
central
states
pension
fund
is
the
largest
taft-hartley
multiemployer
fund
in
the
united
states.
it
has
approximately
half
a
million
participants
and
beneficiaries.
it
has
over
12,000
contributing
employers
spread
out
over
40
states,
and
it
distributes
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
retirees
and
their
dependents
in
the
form
of
benefit
payments.
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
who
the
responsibilities
are...
what
the
responsibilities
are
of
the
respondents
in
its
relation
to...
as
compared
to
the
union.
the
trustees
are
charged
under
the
statute,
under
erisa,
to
represent
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
retirees,
of
which
we
have
approximately
116,000.
also
in
our
constituency
we
have
active
union
participants
and
non-active
union
participants,
the
state
right
to
workers.
we
also
have
beneficiaries
of
the
retirees
and
the
participants
which
includes
their
spouses
and
their
children.
now,
under
erisa,
as
we
perceive
the
statute,
they
are
our
responsibility.
we
have
an
unwavering,
uncompromising
duty
to
protect
their
interests
within
the
law.
what
the
petitioners
seek
here
is
the
imposition
of
compulsory
arbitration
upon
the
respondent's
board
of
trustees.
they
seek
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
trustees
have
not
agreed
to
the
imposition
of
arbitration,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
trustees
have
no
access
to
nor
can
they
participate
in
the
arbitration
process
that
is
submitted
by
the
petitioners,
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
erisa,
enacted
in
1975,
specifically
provides,
pursuant
to
mepa,
as
it
was
revised
in
1980,
that
the
trustees
may
sue
under
a
federal
specific
cause
of
action,
section
515,
which
congress
gave
us
under
mepa,
that
congress
provided
for
us
a
specific
forum
under
erisa,
that
they
provided
for
us
federal
mandatory
remedies
in
delinquent
contribution
cases
where
we
are
successful
that
are
mandatory,
including
attorney
fees
and
statutory
liquidated
damages,
and
nowhere,
your
honors,
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
is
there
any
mention
about
congress
intending
at
any
point
to
insert
arbitration
as
a
condition
precedent.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
that,
your
honor...
i
am
not
going
to
dodge
your
question.
i
will
answer
it
very
quickly.
it's
an
open
question
as
the
third
circuit
said.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
but
it
is
not
an
open
question.
the
third
circuit
indicated
in
the
seamans
case
that
they
doubted
that
the
parties
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
force
the
trustees
to
amend
their
trust
agreement.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
i
do.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
i
would--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--no,
because
it
is
something
that
the
trustees
under
404,
which
we
believe
is
the
heart
of
erisa,
the
prudent
man
rule,
is
something
that
the
trustees
would
be
empowered
to
do,
because
in
the
final
analysis,
as
we
perceive
the
statute,
we
are
being
held
accountable,
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
fact
that
congress
wanted
the
buck
to
stop
somewhere,
and
not
to
have
it
passing
back
between
unions,
employers,
and
so
on,
and
that
we
think
that
the
statute
therefore
enacting
404
gave
us
some
broad
discretion
within
the
confines
of
the
common
law
fiduciary
duties,
which
erisa
codified.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes?
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we
cannot
delegate
away
core
fiduciary
responsibilities
under
erisa,
that
erisa
has
a
specific
provision
that
the
fiduciary
duties,
the
ultimate
accountability,
if
you
will,
cannot
be
delegated
to
anyone
else.
there
is
one
exception
under
asset
management,
but
beyond
that
we
cannot
delegate
that
authority
away.
we
can't
pass
the
buck
to
someone
else.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
we
think
that
if
the
result
of
the
arbitration
is
such
that
it...
as
prudent
men
we
think
that
the
procedure
or
the
process
itself
is
infirm--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--or
the
result
was
wrong.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
your
honor,
we
think
that
this
is
where
the
tension
comes
in
between
erisa
and
taft-hartley.
we
have
in
effect,
as
we
view
the
statute,
an
unwavering
obligation
to
do
as
prudent
men
what
we
think
is
to
protect
the
participants
and
beneficiaries,
and
if
we
see
that
a
situation
has
arisen
that
in
good
faith
and
as
intelligent,
prudent
men
under
the
federal
fiduciary
standard
we
think
is
wrong,
that
we
think
we
have
a
duty
to
seek
to
repair
that
problem.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
really,
we
are
talking,
your
honor,
about
the
forum
here,
and
i
know
that
the
petitioners
have
suggested
that
this
is
going
to
open
up
the
floodgates,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
taft-hartley
has
been
around
since
1947,
and
so
have
taft-hartley
trust
funds,
and
so
have
trustee
lawsuits
been
filed
since
1947,
and
this
doctrine,
which
originated
originally
under
days
electric,
is
of
recent
vintage.
it
is
1974.
and
not
until
1974
has
the
exhaustion
doctrine
gained
any
prominence
at
all
in
the
federal
system,
and
in
that
case,
days
electric,
decide
in
1974
in
the
middle
district
of
florida,
the
judge
there
characterized
the
decision
of
this
court
in
louis
v.
benedict
as
one
that
this
court
ruled
in
that
case,
the
ruling
in
that
case
about
unions
not
being
able...
or
employers
not
being
able
to
set
off
against
trustees
for
the
transgressions
of
unions,
he
said
that
that
was
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
and
that
to
require
trustees
under
a
taft-hartley
collection
action
to
defer
to
the
arbitration
process
was
a
rule
of
procedure,
and
it
did
not
subvert
their
rights
at
all
to
switch
them
from
court
into
that
forum.
that
case
was
picked
up...
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
correct.
that
case
was
followed
by
a
district
court
in
the
howard
martin
case
in
indiana
federal
court,
and
it
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
howard
martin,
and
it
is
interesting
to
point
out
in
that
case
that
the
seventh
circuit
suggested
that
the
trustees'
argument
that
they
didn't
have
access
to
the
tribunal
fell
of
its
own
weight.
merely
ask
the
union
to
file
the
grievance,
the
party
of
primary
interest,
and
that
will
resolve
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
we
did
that,
and
there
was
no
arbitration.
it
was
not
done,
and
the
howard
martin
company
went
into
bankruptcy.
i
think
that
one
of
the
main
problems
that
we
see
is
the
fact
that
in
our
constituency
we
represent
retirees
as
well
as
active
union
participants.
to
delegate
a
basic
core
fiduciary
duty
of
collecting
contributions
which
is,
after
all
the
life's
blood
of
any
pension
or
health
and
welfare
fund,
we
have
to
collect
the
money,
and
we
think
that
asking
the
union
to
handle
that
phase
of
our
collection
work
is...
creates
a
problem,
because
we
think
that
the
unions,
not
for
sinister
reasons,
but
for
legitimate
reasons,
often
have
a
dilemma
or
problems
of
their
own.
we
think
that
there
are
basic
built-in
conflicts
of
interest.
for
example,
the
retirees
that
we
represent
the
union
owes
no
duty
of
fair
representation
to.
typically
what
can
happen
is
that
the
fund
will
do
an
audit
with
its
auditors
of
a
company
and
turn
up
evidence
that
employees
maybe
four
or
five
years
ago
were
not
reported
properly.
the
employer
asserts
that.
it's
a
coverage
question.
we
go
to
the
union
and
say,
would
you
please...
this
dispute,
we
are
trying
to
collect
on
employees
who
are
no
longer
around.
they
don't
belong
to
the
union
any
more.
they
don't
even
work
for
the
employer
any
more.
a
union
as
a
practical
matter
may
have
difficulty
trying
to
do
that
or
even
wanting
to
do
it.
there
are
cost
factors
involved,
and
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult,
and
we
can't
force
them
to
do
it.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
we
think
that
we
could
file
suit.
we
also
think
that
the
practical
effect
of
it
is,
first
off,
the
arbitration
under
taft-hartley
as
it
has
been
developed
by
this
court
and
as
enunciated
by
congress
is
still,
after
all,
a
matter
of
contract,
and
the
basic...
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
we
never
agreed
to
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioners
in
their
collective
bargaining
agreements
agreed
in
the
pension
and
health
and
welfare
articles
which
are
cited
in
the
appendix
to
allow
the
parties
who
founded
the
trust
to
appoint
trustees
and
to
be
bound
by
the
trust
agreement
that
is
put
together
by
the
trustees.
in
addition
to
that,
they
agreed
to
be
bound
by
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
trust
agreement
as
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
other
words,
the
trust
agreement
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
in
the
trust
agreement
itself,
as
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
the
trustees
have
a
right
to
file
suit
in
court
independent
of
and
not
to
the
detriment
of
the
union.
the
union
has
its
own
rights.
we
think
that's
fairly
clear,
and
relating
to
the
trilogy
and
justice
white's
opinion
in
atkinson
versus
sinclair,
it
is
still
a
matter
of
contract.
as
to
the
congressional
intent
that
petitioners
alluded
to
about
congress
and
arbitration,
congress
is
no
stranger
to
arbitration.
when
it
has
addressed,
it
has
spoken
directly
about
it,
for
example,
in
the
railway
labor
act.
in
the
railway
labor
act,
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
in
the
northwest
airlines
case,
arbitration
is
mandatory.
it
is
mandatory
under
302(c)(5)(d),
deadlock
situations.
congress
said
arbitration
is
mandatory.
they
said
that
it
is
required
under
the
withdrawal
liability
act
of
erisa,
but
even
there
congress
said
that
the
arbitrator
in
that
situation
is
not
to
act
like
the
typical
arbitrator
in
the
collective
bargaining
sense.
he
is
to
serve
more
of
a
judge.
you
are
either
right
or
your're
wrong.
and
finally,
the
desirability
of
private
agreements
under
209(d)
of
taft-hartley,
which
is
congress's
expression,
says
it
is
the
desire,
it
is
the
preferred
policy,
and
as
this
court
has
developed
through
the
steelworkers
trilogy
and
the
atkinson
case,
that
is
the
preference,
and
arbitration
is
a
wonderful
thing
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
it
and
it
serves
a
great
purpose
in
this
nation
under
the
labor
law.
however,
it
is
still
a
matter
of
contract,
and
we
didn't
agree
to
it.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
if
we...
i
do
not
think
so.
as
indicated,
i
think,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
federation
of
labor
in
this
case,
which,
while
their
point
of
view
was
relying
principally
on
contract
trust
agreements,
i
don't
think
that
they
are.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
suggested
or...
and
also
the
seamens
case
in
the
third
circuit,
that
if
the
employer
is
concerned
that
the
union
is
going
to
get
another
bite
at
the...
to
get
a
shot
at
him
later,
or
to
take
him
into
court
later,
that
the
employer
can
join
the
union
in
the
lawsuit,
or
if
arbitration
is
proceeding,
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
the
amaro
versus
continental
can
case,
which
we
expressed
to
this
court
last
week,
the
court
may
to
avoid
the
double
forum
and
double
exposure
grant
a
stay
of
the
proceedings
and
defer
to
the
arbitrator.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
he
can
join
him
as
a
third
party
defendant,
which
was
done
in...
which
the
counsel
here--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
your
honor,
the
parties...
we
don't
think
it's
any
different
than
a
situation
under
301,
for
example,
where
federal
courts
have
interpreted
contracts,
where
the
parties
haven't
agreed
to
a
grievance
procedure,
and
the
parties
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
have
agreed
to
a
bargain,
but
there
are
some
ambiguities
in
the
bargain.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
he
is.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
no.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
sure.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
okay--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--the
union
could
intervene--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--also,
of
course,
the--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--no.
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
they
can
file.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
sure.
i
mean,
anyone
that
we
mentioned
at
the
top
of
our
argument
would
have
status
to
sue
us
under
502.
as
we
said
before,
the
unions
do
not
have
a
duty
of
fair
representation
to
the
retirees.
they
don't
have
any
duty
to
the
beneficiaries,
and
they
don't
have
a
duty
to
the
trustees,
and
it
is
the
retirees
and
the
beneficiaries
who
rely
on
the
trustees.
i
mean,
we
are
their
representatives.
we
are
the
ones
designated
by
congress
to
protect
the
funding
of
that
fund
and
their
assets
and
their
financial
future.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
the--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--no.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
well,
in
some
of
the
cases--
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
--well,
if...
our
position
is
that
if
there
is...
if
it
is
not
clear,
and
we
have
potential
liability,
which
we
do
under
erisa
to
anybody,
a
determination
has
to
be
made
and
it
has
to
be
done
in
good
faith.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
very
correct.
that
is
very
true.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
to
get
an
instruction.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
erisa
gives
us
the
authority
to
bring
an
action
in
federal
court,
yes.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes,
it
does.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
in
order...
we
have,
as
one
reviews
the
congressional
purposes,
1029(a),
(b),
and
(c),
the
responsibilities
of
trustees
under
the
statute
are
enormous,
and
as
it
should
be.
we
view
it
almost
as
a...
we
don't
know
of
any
higher
responsibility
that
the
congress
could
place
on
other
citizens
than
to
safeguard
the
assets
of
people
for
their
retirement
years.
mr.
russell
n.
luplow
yes.
another
aspect
of
the
case,
and
there
are
really
two
issues,
in
a
sense,
although
they
are
interrelated,
and
that
is
in
the
prosser
case,
where
prosser
has
indicated
that
audits,
the
scope
of
an
audit
is
also
subject
to
arbitration.
our
trust
agreement...
in
other
words,
when
we
went
in
to
perform
an
audit
on
prosser,
they
said,
wait
a
minute,
you
know,
you
can't
audit,
because
the
scope
of
your
audit
is
also
arbitrable,
and
that...
and
i
wanted
to
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention,
that
in
the
trust
agreement
we
have
two
provisions
that
address
that.
one
is
production
of
pertinent
records,
and
also
the
trustees'
power
to
construe
the
trust
agreement.
basically,
the
central
states'
funds
with
half
a
million
people,
12,000
employers
over
40
states,
some
people
are
surprised
when
we
say
this,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
have
an
honor
system
of
reporting.
there
is
no
other
practical
way
for
us
to
do
it.
monthly
the
employers
fill
out
a
report
form
and
send
us
a
check,
and
so
it
is
based
on
an
honor
system,
and
the
only
checks
and
balances
we
have,
we
perform
random
audits,
and
we
do
that
through
our
audit
department.
we
also
know
that,
under
erisa
and
also
under
department
of
labor
advisory
opinions
that
have
been
issued,
that
the
funds
must
provide
coverage
and
grant
pension
credits
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
makes
contributions
if
he
was
obligated
in
the
first
instance.
we
look
upon
audits
as
a
matter
of
pure
trust
administration,
and
subject
only
to
a
federal
court's
review
as
to
whether
or
not
the
scope
of
our
audit
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
since
we
have
literally
thousands
of
employers
and
thousands
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
range
in
grievance
resolving
mechanisms
from
one
arbitrator
to
a
panel
of
three
to
joint
committees,
that
it
would
be
absolutely
chaotic
for
a
centralized
fund
of
our
size
to
be
bound
by
an
arbitrator's
decision
in
iowa
that
you
have
a
right
to
audit
for
three
years,
someone
in
indiana
for
one
year,
the
joint
committee
says
five
years.
we
think
that
that
is
particularly
a
matter
of
pure
trust
administration,
and
that
the
scope
of
our
audits
are
really
something
that
should
be
subject
to
a
court's
review
as
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
scope
of
conduct
of
it.
in
concluding...
i
see
the
light
is
on...
i
would
say
this,
that
the
entire
statutory
scheme
of
erisa
is
to,
number
one,
to
safeguard
the
assets
for
retirees
and
their
dependents,
and
it
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
accountability.
we
think
that
the
petitioner's
position
allows
for
a
dilution
of
the
fixing
of
that
responsibility
by
requiring
us
to
rely
on
the
union
who
is
not
our
agent
under
amex
coal,
whom
we
cannot
tell
what
to
do,
who
itself
may
have
for
legitimate
reasons
a
conflict
of
interest
as
to
the
constituents
that
we
represent
as
opposed
to
the
ones
that
they
represent.
we
think
that
that
together
with
the
statutory
history
makes
it
clear
that
the
responsibility
to
collect
money
that
we
are
entitled
to
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
strictly
with
the
trustees,
and
that
any
dilution
or
any
rule
of
law
that
starts
to
split
that
responsibility
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
participants
and
beneficiaries,
and
contrary
to
congressional
intent.
thank
you
very
much.
