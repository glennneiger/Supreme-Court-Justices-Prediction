mr.
david
f.
yates
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
cases
before
the
court
today,
which
are
consolidated,
arise
out
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship.
schneider
and
prosser
are
two
independent
moving
companies
located
in
st.
louis,
missouri.
over
a
number
of
years,
they
entered
into
a
series
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
a
teamster's
local
in
st.
louis.
in
accordance
with
these
agreements,
they
agreed
that
they
would
make
contributions
to
the
respondent
trustee
funds
on
behalf
of
regular
employees.
the
labor
agreements
further
provided
that
contributions
would
not
be
made
on
behalf
of
non-regular
employees,
who
are
variously
referred
to
in
the
agreements
as
part-time,
extras,
casuals,
temporary,
and
seasonals.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
this
particular
dispute
arises
out
of
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
it
does
not
involve
the
interpretation
or
construction
of
statutory
rights.
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
schneider
and
prosser
and
the
unions
expressly
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
resolve
differences
regarding
the
meaning
or
application
of
the
agreements
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
in
the
contracts.
they
did
not
provide
the
trustees
would
have
the
right
to
resolve
those
questions
of
coverage,
as
they
are
referred
to,
in
litigation
in
federal
court.
i
will
address--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--if
there
is
no
question
regarding
the
coverage,
then
i
think
that
the--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--oh,
if
there
is
a
question
about
what
the
words
mean
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--with
respect
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
the
employer
and
the
union
have
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
resolve
the
coverage
question
under
the
contract,
i
believe
that
is
resolving
of
the
contract.
under
the
trust
agreement,
i
believe
the
trustees
of
the
funds
would
have
the
right
to
resolve
that
question.
mr.
david
f.
yates
in
this
situation,
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
provided
that
the
employers
would
make
contributions
on
behalf
of
the
regular
employees--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--and
not
on
behalf
of
extras,
casuals,
part-times,
seasonal,
and
temporary.
mr.
david
f.
yates
the
trust
agreements,
on
the
other
hand,
conditioned
eligibility
for
benefits
on
employees
for
whom
contributions
were
required
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
so
it
goes
back
to
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
expressly
provides.
mr.
david
f.
yates
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
in
effect
the
trustees
have
said,
we
will
be
bound
by
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
respect
to
the
employer's
obligation
to
make
contributions.
mr.
david
f.
yates
that's
correct.
mr.
david
f.
yates
at
the
point
in
time
when
this
case
arose,
which
was
1978
and
'79,
the
union
was
around.
it
still
is
around
today.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
nolde
brothers,
which
is
a
fairly
recent
decision,
and
republic
versus
maddox,
the
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
and
the
union
to
handle
this
matter
through
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
would
continue
beyond
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
i
believe
that's
fairly
clear.
mr.
david
f.
yates
i
believe
they
do,
provided
they
do
it
openly
and
not
in
a
sinister
fashion,
and
i
would
like
to
take
it
back
to
these--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--okay.
i
am
relying
on
their
status
as
the
statutory
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
when
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
first
negotiated,
the
union
at
that
time
is
doing
precisely
what
you
are
addressing
now.
the
union
at
that
time
is
deciding
with
the
employer
through
collective
bargaining
how
to
divide
the
employer's
financial
pot.
in
this
case,
for
example,
it
was
agreed
that
the
employer
would
make
contributions
to
the
funds
on
behalf
of
only
regular
employees,
and
not
on
behalf
of
other
non-regular
employees.
so,
at
that
point
the
union
is
in
effect
saying,
we
are
waiving,
if
you
may,
our
claim
that
the
employer
should
make
contributions
on
behalf
of--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--yes.
mr.
david
f.
yates
i
agree
with
that,
yes.
mr.
david
f.
yates
i
believe
that
once
again
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
funding
obligation
and
the
determination
of
employee
benefits,
and
i
believe
it
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
trustees
to
say
that
they
will
continue
to
provide
benefits
for
an
employee
even
if
the
union
and
the
employer
agree
that
contributions
will
not
be
made
for
that
employee,
just
as
in
kaiser
the
measure
of
the
funding
obligation
was
the
number
of
tons
of
non-union
coal
produced.
it
is
simply
a
measure
of...
upon
the
plan.
mr.
david
f.
yates
that's
correct.
now,
it's
very
likely
that
the
pension
fund
or
the
health
and
welfare
fund
might
say,
we
will
not
permit
participation
on
that
basis,
and
that
is
within
their
right,
too.
the
employer
and
the
union
must
strike
a
bargain
which
the
trustees
then
accept,
but
once
having
accepted
it,
they
are
bound
by
that
bargain.
they
are,
after
all,
the
product
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
in
the
first
place.
mr.
david
f.
yates
under
this
contract,
the
contract
did
not
expressly
provide
that
the
company
has
the
right
to
submit
grievances
to
arbitration.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
f.
yates
that's
correct.
that
raises
a
question
which
troubled
the
court
below,
and
that
is,
can
the
trustees
submit
a
claim
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
under
this
contract?
it
is
submitted
that
the
trustees
in
this
situation
raised
the
issue
and
are
standing
in
the
shoes
of
exactly
the
employees
who
they
are
claiming
contributions
are
due
on
behalf
of.
that
is
the
casuals
and
extras.
and
it
appears...
it
would
seem
that
the
trustees,
if
they
are
acting
at
the
partial
or...
i'm
sorry,
the
part-time
employees'
behest
is...
are
in
fact
standing
in
their
shoes.
i
am
reserving
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
so
i
will
sit
down--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--yes.
i...
yes.
mr.
david
f.
yates
i
believe
that
the
union
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
review
why,
and
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
entire
issue
here.
we
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
union
to
state
why
it
has
not
made
this
claim
prior
to
the
trustees
raising
it.
we
believe
that
the
union
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
raise
issues
and
to
police
the
contract,
and
if
there
are
questions
of
coverage,
they
should
have
been
raising
them
a
long
time
ago.
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
our
bargain
to
have
the
co-author
of
the
agreement
involved
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
david
f.
yates
yes,
i
do.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
with
respect
to
the
alluding
to
the
statutory
rights
here,
i
think
that
we
are
ahead
of
ourselves
in
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
when
the
union
and
the
employer
sit
down
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations,
they
at
that
time
in
this
case
negotiated
the
funding
obligation
of
the
employer
to
the
trustees.
they
limited
that
funding
obligation
to
less
than
all
employees
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
at
that
time
they
were
in
fact
acting
to
a
certain
extent
as
agent
of
the
trustees.
they
were
negotiating
what
the
obligation
would
be.
what
the
respondents
are
suggesting
here
would
result
in
the,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
the
trust
becoming
the
tail
that
wags
the
dog
here.
they
would
have
the
right
to
come
in
during
the
term
of
the
contract,
state
that
they
don't
think
that
that
bargain
that
was
reached
in
collective
bargaining
is
agreeable
to
them,
is
reasonable,
and
they
are
going
to
attempt
to
upset
it.
the
same
principles--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--by
taking
an
adversary
position
as
to
how
the
contract
should
be
construed--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--well,
yes,
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
they're
saying
to
amend
the
words,
but
that
operates
as
a
de
facto
amendment
to
the
contract
if
they
take
the
contract
and
interpret
it
differently
than
the
employer
and
the
union
understood
the
contract
to
mean
when
they
negotiated.
after
all,
this
court
has
recognized
that
collective
bargaining
contracts
are
based
on
a
history
of
practices
between
the
employer
and
the
union.
they
are
not
negotiated
in
a
vacuum.
they
are
based
on
what
the
practices
have
been
between
the
parties.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
trustees
are
taking
the
position
that
they
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
question
the
interpretation
given
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
the
employer
and
the
union,
and
if
that
happens,
i
think
you
are
going
to
be
removing
the
entire
question
of
the
funding
obligation--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--we
don't.
i
wish
we
knew
what
the
position--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
f.
yates
our
position
is,
the
union
has
never
raised
the
issue,
and
that,
we
think,
is
important.
mr.
david
f.
yates
with
respect
to
the
inconsistent
results,
i
think
there
is
a
legitimate
concern
of
the
trustees
that
there
not
be
inconsistent
results.
we
believe
that
using
the
arbitration
process
to
interpret
the
contract,
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
just
talking
about
an
interpretation
problem,
that
will
go
further
in
preventing
inconsistent
results.
if
the
trustees
lose
in
the
district
court,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
union
from
filing
a
grievance
and
proceeding
to
arbitration
or
to
prevent
the
union
from
striking
and
attempting
to
obtain
something
the
trustees
could
not
obtain
in
federal
court.
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
union
and
the
employer
from
negotiating
an
amendment
to
their
agreement.
mr.
david
f.
yates
nothing
at
all.
mr.
david
f.
yates
the
respondents
have
just
stated
that
if
they
disagree
with
that
interpretation--
mr.
david
f.
yates
--absolutely.
most
certainly.
