mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
justice
stevens'
concern.
appellees
have
contended
that
the
michigan
act
is
not
preempted
by
the
federal
act
in
this
case
because
the
federal
act
only
applies
to
handlers,
and
michigan
is
not
a
handler.
that
observation
might
be
more
pertinent
if
the
claim
in
this
case
were
that
michigan
had
violated
the
federal
act,
but
that
is
not
the
claim.
the
claim
is
that
the
michigan
act
is
preempted
by
the
federal
act.
for
example,
michigan
act
forbidding
farmers
to
consistent
with
the
federal
act
forbidding
farmers
to
join
cooperatives.
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
section
2303(a)
and
(c).
for
the
same
reason,
michigan
cannot
pass
a
law
requiring
farmers
to
join
cooperatives,
because
in
sections
2303(a)
and
(c)
the
right
not
to
join
a
cooperative
is
guaranteed
in
the
same
language
as
the
right
to
join
a
cooperative.
appellees
also
raise
a
number
of
other
points
about
how
michigan's
act
doesn't
actually
require
membership
in
an
association,
and
about
how
michigan's
act
is
somehow
not
preempted
because
it
involves
state
action.
if
the
court
is
troubled
by
those,
i
will
be
happy
to
respond
to
them.
otherwise,
i
propose
to
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
about
what
the
purposes
of
the
federal
act
are,
and
how
michigan's
act
is
inconsistent
with
them.
the
government
contends
that
michigan's
act
is
preempted
by
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act
insofar
as
it
requires
that
unwilling
farmers
be
represented
by
the
accredited
cooperative,
and
requires
unwilling
farmers
to
pay
financial
support
to
cooperatives.
the
federal
act
says
that
cooperatives
may
not
control
unwilling
farmers
in
their
relations
with
handlers,
and
may
not
force
unwilling
farmers
to
join.
the
michigan
act
makes
a
cooperative
the
exclusive
representative
of
an
unwilling
farmer
in
his
dealing
with
handlers,
and
requires
the
unwilling
farmer
to
pay
financial
support.
the
reason
that
congress
insisted
in
the
federal
act
that
cooperative
membership
be
voluntary
and
the
cooperatives
not
control
unwilling
farmers
dealing
with
handlers
were
several.
in
the
first
place,
that
had
long
been
a
requirement
of
the
antitrust
laws,
even
before
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act
was
passed.
for
example,
a
cooperative
could
violate
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
by
engaging
in
predatory
practices
against
farmers
who
refused
to
join.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
maryland
and
virginia
milk
producers
case
cited
in
our
brief.
or,
to
take
a
case
that
is
maybe
even
closer
to
this
case,
a
cooperative
could
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
by
agreeing
with
buyers
about
the
price
they
would
pay
to
non-members
of
the
cooperative.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
borden
case,
cited
in
the
reply
brief.
the
second
reason
congress
was
concerned...
congress
insisted
that
cooperative
membership
remain
voluntary
was
that
there
were
some
independent
farmers
who
simply
were
unhappy
about
paying
fees
to
cooperative
associations.
representative
iatta
said
on
the
house
floor,
"the
fees
being
charged
by
these
associations
are
no
small
matter
to
the
farmer.
"
"some
of
these
associations
are
assessing
members
1
percent
of
their
gross.
"
so,
i
think
it
is
important
that
with
the
house
amendments
the
farmer
still
has
the
right
to
say
no
to
an
association.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it
is
not.
as
i
said,
one
of
congress's
concerns
in
insisting...
the
basic
purpose
of
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act
is
to
make
it
easier
for
farmers
to
join
cooperatives
if
they
wish
by
protecting
them
against
coercion
to
keep
them
out,
but
a
corresponding
purpose
of
the
federal
act
is
to
assure
that
they
don't
have
to
join
if
they
don't
want
to,
and--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--it
has
very
little
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
perhaps
overstate
it.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
because
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act
has
a
number
of
purposes
that
are
unrelated
to
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws,
that
the
fact
that
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws
doesn't
make
parker
against
brown
decisive.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
well,
let
me
try
and
explain
it
this
way.
what
the
appellees
say
is,
the
michigan
statute
is
not
preempted
by
the
federal
act
because
it
involves
state
action.
the
very
purpose
of
the
supremacy
clause
is
to
forbid
state
action
which
is
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
what
parker
against
brown
says
is
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
state
actions
that
are
not
preempted
by
the
sherman
act,
and
those
have
come
to
be
called
state
action
cases,
where
the
state
gets
involved
in
fixing
prices,
but
that
is
not...
to
say
that
this
case
involves
state
action
only
sets
up
the
question
about
whether
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
is
frustrated
by
what
michigan
has
done.
in
addition
to
the
consistency
of
the
ag
fair
practices
act
with
the
antitrust
laws,
i
was
about
to
suggest
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
purposes
that
underlie
it.
for
example,
the
protection
of
farmers
who
don't
want
to
pay
fees
to
an
association.
another
example
might
be
that
in
the
course
of
the
passage
there
was
considerable
concern
expressed
that
if
farmers
had
to
join
cooperatives,
buyers
of
agricultural
products
couldn't
shop
around
for
quality
or
price
terms
that
were
different
from
those
offered
by
the
cooperative.
there
was
also
some
sense
that
competition
among
cooperatives
was
beneficial
to
the
farmer,
competition
among
cooperatives
for
farmers'
membership,
but
that
if
membership
in
cooperatives
were
not
voluntary,
the
decision
about
what
one
to
join
mightn't
be
made
on
the
merits.
so,
because
michigan's
act
is
inconsistent
with
those
purposes
as
well
as
the
antitrust
theme
that
underlies
the
voluntariness
requirement,
it
is
preempted
by
the
federal
statute
even
if
it
might
be
state
action
under
some
parker
against
brown
analysis,
although
i
might
suggest
that
it
is
not.
i
was
about
to
say
that
what
michigan's
act
does
is
to
authorize
private
parties,
that
is
to
say,
farmers
and
handlers,
to
set
the
price
in
their
private
dealings
at
which
other
farmers
may
buy
and
sell
their
goods.
that
is
quite
similar
to
the
private
action...
the
non-signer
provision
in
louisiana's
statute
that
this
court
held
invalid
in
stregman
brothers.
it
is
also
quite
similar
to
the
california
statute
which
required
private
parties
to
set
prices
in
midcal
aluminum.
this
court
said
that
that
sort
of
leaving
to
private
parties
about
the
price
at
which
people
should
buy
and
sell
was
inconsistent
with
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
so
even
if
state
action
were
relevant,
this
wouldn't
qualify
as
state
action,
but
as
i
say,
the
ag
fair
practices
act,
while
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws,
also
has
a
number
of
other
purposes
which
are
frustrated
by
the
michigan
act.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
well,
you
are
talking
about
a
different
sort
of
state
arrangement.
what
you
are
describing
is
similar
to
california's
pro
rate
act
to
which
they
draw
an
analogy.
the
state
is
free
if
it
wants
to
set
up
a
marketing
order
system
for
asparagus
by
which
the
state
would
control
the
collection
of
asparagus
and
maybe
even
fix
the
price
at
which
asparagus
would
be
sold,
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
what
is
happening
in
here.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
think
not,
so
long
as
it
is
the
state
that
is
doing
it
and
not
a
cooperative
association.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
well,
it's
not
simply
the
fact
that
the
state
has
passed...
simply
because
the
state
has
passed
this
law
does
not
immunize
it
from
preemption.
what
i
was
saying
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
making
farmers
do
what
a
cooperative
association
wants
them
to
do
on
the
one
hand
and
making
them
do
what
state
law
directs
through
a
prorate
program.
as
mr.
scoville
suggested,
the
closer
analogy
to
what
michigan
has
done
is
not
california's
pro
rate
law,
with
which
this
court
dealt
in
parker
against
brown,
but
california's
cooperative
bargaining
association
act,
which
only
last
year
was
amended
to
provide
for
collective
bargaining
between
cooperative
associations
and
handlers.
that
california
bargaining
law,
which
deals
with
cooperative
associations,
unlike
the
pro
rate
law,
that
california
bargaining
law
does
not
require
representation
of
unwilling
farmers
by
the
bargaining
association.
the
michigan
statute
does.
thank
you.
