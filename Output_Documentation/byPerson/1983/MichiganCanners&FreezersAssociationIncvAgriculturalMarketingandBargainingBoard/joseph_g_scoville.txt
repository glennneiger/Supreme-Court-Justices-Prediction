mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
michigan
statute
conflicts
with
and
therefore
is
preempted
by
an
act
of
congress.
the
act
of
congress
is
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act
of
1967.
it
was
designed
by
congress
to
safeguard
an
individual
farmer's
right
to
join
or
not
to
join
a
cooperative
association.
it
was
also
designed
by
congress
to
strengthen
the
competitive
marketing
system
for
commodities
in
this
country.
the
michigan
state
statute
is
the
agricultural
marketing
and
bargaining
act
of
1972.
in
contrast
to
the
federal
act,
the
michigan
act
imposes
a
union
model
on
agriculture
in
the
state.
it
compels
unwilling
farmers
to
adhere
to
the
prices,
terms,
and
service
fees
of
a
cooperative
association.
it
compels
unwilling
purchasers
to
negotiate
with
cooperative
associations.
appellants
do
not
contend
that
the
federal
act
has
occupied
this
field
of
regulation.
we
contend
instead
that
the
michigan
act
and
the
specific
provisions
of
the
michigan
act
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
full
purposes
of
the
federal
act
by
destroying
rights
created
or
protected
in
the
federal
act.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
the
california
act,
your
honor,
is
well
distinguishable
from
the
michigan
act
in
two
very
important
respects.
the
california
act
does
not
purport
to
bind
unwilling
farmers
by
the
decisions
of
the
cooperative.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
perhaps,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
--perhaps
we
are
not
talking
about
the
same
california
act.
there
are
two
california
acts.
one
is
the
california
pro
rate
act,
and
the
other
is
the
california
bargaining
one.
i
am
confused
as
to
which
one
your
honor
is
talking
about.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
the
california
bargaining
act,
which
is
the
one
that
is
analogous
to
the
michigan
act,
the
one
that
directly
regulates
agricultural
marketing
and
bargaining,
is
not
at
all
like
the
michigan
act
in
the
two
particulars
that
i
mentioned.
first,
unwilling
farmers
are
not
affected
at
all.
unwilling
farmers
are
free
to
market
their
products
free
from
the
cooperative.
they
need
not
support
the
cooperative,
and
the
cooperative's
decisions
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
unwilling
farmer.
furthermore,
your
honor,
although
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
to
impasse
under
the
california
bargaining
law,
the
duty
to
bargain
between
cooperatives
and
purchasers
is
not
so
draconian
as
it
is
under
the
michigan
act.
under
the
michigan
act,
if
a
purchaser
and
a
cooperative
do
not
agree
a
certain
time
before
the
marketing
season
begins,
the
purchaser
must
either
submit
to
compulsory
arbitration,
in
which
the
price
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
trade
will
be
fixed
for
him,
arbitration,
or
he
must
buy
nothing
from
any
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
in
the
state.
he
is,
in
other
words,
thrown
out
of
the
state
of
michigan
for
that
particular
crop.
in
those
two
important
respects,
the
michigan
act
is
much
different
from
the
california
act.
the
california
pro
rate
law,
your
honor,
is
a
marketing
order
act.
it
is
very
analogous
to
the
federal
act,
the
federal
marketing
agreements
act
of
1937.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
cooperatives.
a
marketing
order
act
like
the
federal
or
california
act
tries
to
control
the
supply
of
an
agricultural
commodity,
and
the
marketing
orders,
although
approved
by
a
majority
of
farmers,
are
also
approved
by
an
agency
of
the
state
of
california,
and
that
is
the
big
difference
between
the
michigan
act
here
under
attack
and
the
federal
law
in
which
federal
marketing
orders
are
issued
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
california
state
act.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
no,
your
honor.
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
none
of
the
other
state
bargaining
acts
impinges
on
the
rights
of
non-consenting
farmers
to
the
extent
the
michigan
act
does.
for
instance,
in
minnesota,
the
act
expressly
says
that
the
cooperative
may
not
bargain
on
behalf
of
or
assess
fees
against
any
unwilling
farmer.
that
is
a
distinction
of
great
magnitude
between
the
minnesota
act
and
the
michigan
act,
because
the
michigan
act
makes
unwilling
farmers
a
part
of
the
cooperative
in
every
important
economic
respect.
i
will
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
facts
of
this
controversy,
because
i
think
they
show
the
interest
of
the
appellants
very
clearly.
in
december
of
1973,
the
appellee
board,
acting
pursuant
to
the
michigan
act,
certified
a
bargaining
unit
for
processing
asparagus
in
the
state
of
michigan.
the
board
defined
that
unit
to
include
all
michigan
farmers
who
grew
a
certain
minimum
quantity
of
asparagus
for
sale--
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
--yes,
your
honor.
it
has
traditionally
been
concentrated
in
the
western
side
of
the
state.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
yes,
your
honor.
the
same
is
true.
the
board
determined
that
433
asparagus
farmers
in
the
state
of
michigan
fit
into
the
certified
bargaining
unit.
thereafter,
appellee
macma,
which
is
a
cooperative,
entered
into
signed
exclusive
agency
agreements
with
236
of
those
433
farmers,
or
55
percent
of
the
bargaining
unit.
macma
then
petitioned
the
appellee
board
for
accredited
status
under
the
act,
and
macma
was
entitled
to
a
credited
status
because
it
had
signed
exclusive
agency
agreements
with
over
50
percent
of
the
farmers
in
the
bargaining
unit
who
themselves
produced
over
50
percent
of
the
crop
in
that
unit.
in
january
of
1974,
the
board
accredited
macma
under
the
act.
now,
under
the
act,
accredited
status
has
two
major
consequences.
first,
macma
became
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
all
433
farmers
in
the
bargaining
unit,
whether
or
not
those
farmers
consented.
second,
all
purchasers
were
required
to
negotiating
with
macma,
and
were
forbidden
from
negotiating
with
any
individual
farmer,
including
the
197
farmers
who
did
not
consent
to
macma
representation.
thereafter,
the
appellees
as
plaintiffs...
i
am
sorry,
the
appellants,
plaintiffs
below,
began
this
action
in
the
state
circuit
court
to
declare
the
michigan
act
unconstitutional.
ferris
pierson
and
dukesherer
farms,
two
of
the
appellants,
were
two
of
the
197
michigan
asparagus
farmers
who
did
not
want
to
be
represented
by
macma
and
did
not
want
to
pay
the
1
and
a
half
percent
compulsory
service
fee
on
their
gross
produce.
they
initiated
this
action
in
order
to
vindicate
their
right,
protected
by
the
federal
act,
not
to
join
a
cooperative.
the
other
appellants
are
purchasers
of
agricultural
commodities
in
the
state
of
michigan.
they
began
this
action
to
vindicate
their
right
protected
by
section
2304
of
the
federal
act
not
to
be
compelled
to
negotiate
or
deal
with
a
cooperative.
the
michigan
courts
rejected
appellant's
claim
of
repugnancy
between
the
state
and
federal
acts,
and
this
appeal
followed.
in
order
to
decide
this
appeal,
this
court
will
have
to
answer
basic
questions
about
the
objectives
of
the
federal
law.
is
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
federal
act
to
safeguard
the
right
of
an
individual
farmer
not
to
join
cooperative?
is
another
objective
of
the
federal
act
to
safeguard
the
right
of
a
purchaser
not
to
deal
with
cooperatives?
if
so,
the
michigan
act
must
fall.
the
michigan
supreme
court
admitted
as
much.
it
admitted
that
the
existence
of
such
federal
rights
would
be
fatal
to
the
michigan
act.
the
michigan
court
stated
in
its
opinion,
which
is
reproduced
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
and
i
am
reading
now
from
page
a-8,
"were
we
to
agree
that
section
2304
or
any
provision
in
the
federal
act
was
meant
to
affirmatively
create
or
protect
rights
of
private
dealings
between
individual
producers
and
processors,
we
would
agree
that
the
state
act
must
fall,
because
plainly
the
state
act
conflicts
with
that
result.
"
the
michigan
supreme
court
avoided
a
conflict
between
the
two
acts
by
holding
that
the
federal
act
did
not
create
an
absolute
right
in
a
farmer
to
join
or
not
to
join
a
cooperative,
and
created
no
rights
in
processors.
we
submit
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
clearly
wrong.
the
federal
act
was
expressly
designed
by
congress
to
create
and
preserve
federal
rights.
i
turn
first
to
the
rights
of
farmers
under
the
federal
act.
that
congress
intended
to
preserve
an
individual
farmer's
right
to
join
or
not
join
a
cooperative
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
federal
act.
section
2301
is
a
statement
of
congressional
policy.
it
emphasizes
the
rights
of
individual
farmers,
not
the
rights
of
cooperatives.
section
2301
says
that
the
welfare
of
"individual
farmers
will
be
adversely
affected
unless
they
are
free
to
join
together
voluntarily
in
cooperative.
"
section
2301
goes
on
to
say,
"interference
with
this
right
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
"
to
safeguard
this
right,
section
2303(a)
of
the
federal
act
creates
certain
unfair
practices.
the
first
unfair
practice
is
this.
a
handler
is
forbidden
to
do
the
following:
to
coerce
any
producer
in
the
exercise
of
his
right
to
join
and
belong
to
or
refrain
from
joining
and
belonging
to
a
cooperative.
i
emphasize
that
congress
used
the
words
"right
to
join
and
belong
to
or
to
refrain
from
joining
and
belonging
to.
"
section
2303(c)
likewise
prohibits
a
handler
from
coercing
farmers
into
or
out
of
membership
agreements
or
contracts
of
a
cooperative
or
a
processor.
it
is
critical
for
the
court
to
realize
that
the
statutory
definition
of
handler
includes
agricultural
cooperatives.
in
this
way,
congress
expressly
regulated
the
relationship
between
cooperatives
and
unwilling
farmers.
in
section
2303,
congress
prohibited
cooperatives
from
coercing
any
unwilling
farmer
to
join
them.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
ignored
this
important
fact.
in
interpreting
the
federal
act,
it
equated
the
terms
7
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
opinion.
it
was
only
by
making
this
basic
error
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
able
to
say
that
the
federal
act
affects
cooperatives
only
indirectly.
it
was
only
by
making
this
basic
error
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
able
to
say
that
the
relationship
between
cooperatives
and
unwilling
farmers
was
federally
unregulated.
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
wrong.
congress
directly
regulated
the
relationship
between
cooperatives
and
unwilling
farmers.
it
directly
forbade--
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
--your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
went
further
than
that.
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
federal
act
was
not
designed
to
create
any
federal
right
to
join
or
not
join
a
cooperative.
it
said
that
the
federal
act
was
designed
only
to
prohibit
certain
bad
acts,
certain
acts
of
handler
coercion
and
intimidation,
and
that
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
underlying
economic
right
of
a
farmer
to
join
or
not
join
a
cooperative.
in
other
words,
congress
was
concerned
only
that
farmers
lead
tranquil
lives,
free
of
coercion,
fraud,
and
intimidation,
but
that
congress
somehow
was
unconcerned
about
the
basic
core
economic
right
of
how
a
farmer
may
market
his
or
her
product,
and
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
is
replete
with
discussion
and
consideration
of
the
economic
right
to
market
through
a
cooperative
or
market
individually,
and
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
federal
act
prohibiting
bad
acts,
and
not
give
protection
to
the
basic
economic
right
protected
in
the
federal
act
really
renders
the
act
negatory.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
footnote
number
7,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
g.
scoville
yes,
sir,
without
also
recognizing
there
and
then
throughout
the
opinion
that
"handler"
also
means
"cooperative".
for
instance,
your
honor,
at
page
a-14
of
the
michigan
supreme
court's
opinion,
it
says
fafda's
producer
protections
only
indirectly
affect
cooperative
associations
as
associations.
the
only
way
to
make
that
statement
is
to
ignore
the
fact
that
cooperatives
are
handlers
and
are
subject
to
direct
federal
restraint
in
section
2303.
elsewhere
in
the
opinion,
the
michigan
supreme
court
says
that
the
michigan
legislature
took
a
step
into
a
federally
unregulated
area
in
restructuring
the
arrangements
between
cooperatives
and
unwilling
farmers.
the
only
way
to
say
that
is...
the
only
way
to
conclude
that
is
to
say
that
the
relationship
between
cooperatives
and
unwilling
farmers
is
not
regulated
in
the
federal
act,
and
that
stems
from
their
basic
definitional
mistake
in
failing
to
realize
that
cooperatives
are
handlers
under
the
federal
law,
and
expressly
so.
the
michigan
act
has
a
destructive
effect
on
the
federal
rights
that
we
have
just
been
talking
about.
the
michigan
act
imposes
a
majority
rule
on
michigan
farmers.
once
50
percent
of
farmers
in
a
bargaining
unit
who
represent
50
percent
of
the
crop
in
that
unit
have
signed
up
with
a
cooperative,
all
unwilling
farmers
are
then
swept
into
the
cooperative
sphere
of
influence.
those
farmers
must
adhere
to
the
price
and
other
terms
negotiated
by
the
cooperative.
those
farmers
must
pay
the
service
fee
on
everything
they
sell.
those
farmers
may
not
negotiate
on
their
own
behalf
with
purchasers,
and
worst
of
all,
if
the
cooperative
that
is
representing
these
people
against
their
will
fails
for
any
reason
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
a
particular
purchaser,
and
that
purchaser
does
not
want
to
go
to
bargaining
arbitration,
that
unwilling
farmer
may
not
sell
to
that
purchaser.
in
other
words,
the
michigan
law
allows
cooperatives
to
totally
dominate
unwilling
farmers.
in
summary,
if
the
court
please,
the
michigan
legislature
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
responded
to
the
same
question
with
different
answers.
congress
took
a
careful
look
at
a
very
narrow
question:
what
shall
the
relationship
be
among
cooperatives,
unwilling
farmers,
and
purchasers,
and
congress
determined
that
unwilling
farmers
would
have
a
federal
right
to
stay
free
of
cooperatives,
that
willing
farmers
would
have
a
federal
right
to
join
cooperatives.
congress
also
determined
that
purchasers
could
not
discriminate
against
a
farmer
because
of
that
farmer's
membership
in
a
cooperative,
but
by
the
same
token,
that
purchasers
could
not
be
compelled
to
bargain
with
a
cooperative,
and
i
have
not
had
time
this
morning
to
talk
about
the
compulsory
bargaining
provisions
of
the
michigan
act
in
any
detail.
i
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
and
reply
brief
on
that.
the
michigan
act
upsets
this
careful
balance.
michigan
answers
the
question
differently.
michigan
says
that
the
individual
right
of
a
farmer
must
be
subsumed
by
the
majority.
that
is
to
say,
michigan
takes
the
decision
on
whether
to
join
a
coop
away
from
the
individual
farmer
and
puts
it
in
the
hand
of
a
majority
of
farmers
in
his
unit
and
in
the
hands
of
the
cooperative
association
that
represents
that
majority.
the
two
approaches
cannot
be
reconciled.
for
that
reason,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
michigan
supreme
court
judgment,
and
to
declare
that
the
challenged
sections
of
the
michigan
act
are
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
