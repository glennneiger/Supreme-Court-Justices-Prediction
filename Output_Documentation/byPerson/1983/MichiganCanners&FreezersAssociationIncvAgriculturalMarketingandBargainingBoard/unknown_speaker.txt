unknown
speaker
mr.
scoville,
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
legislation
in
california.
i
am
curious
to
know
whether
you
think
that
portions
of
the
california
act
are
also
invalid
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
all
have
to
contribute
a
certain
amount
of
the
produce,
and
they
are
bound
by
certain
determinations
of
the
group,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
whether
they
have
joined
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
address
both.
unknown
speaker
have
you
identified
any
other
state
agricultural
marketing
acts
which
you
feel
have
the
same
problems
as
michigan's?
unknown
speaker
is
asparagus
raising
in
michigan
concentrated
in
any
one
geographic
area?
unknown
speaker
like
the
deciduous
fruits?
like
cherries
and
apples?
unknown
speaker
mr.
scoville,
i
thought
their
answer
to
that
argument
was,
it
is
not
the
handler,
even
when
you
define
it
broadly,
but
rather
the
state
of
michigan
that
has
applied
the
coercion
when
they
talk
about
that
specifically.
unknown
speaker
mr.
scoville,
will
you
state
again
what
you
think
the
definitional
mistake
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
made
was
and
where
that
occurs
in
its
opinion?
unknown
speaker
and
their
error
in
footnote
number
7
at
page
a-5
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
was
to
use
the
term
"handler"
and
"processor"
interchangeably?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
is
the
federal
statute
here
kind
of
a
branch
of
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
parker
against
brown
analysis
just
doesn't
apply
to
this
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
it.
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
is
not
decisive,
but
does
it
have
some
role
to
play
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
michigan
law
is
preempted?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
what
about
a
state
requirement
that
the
farmers
even
if
they
haven't
joined
the
co-op
have
to
contribute
a
certain
percentage
of
their
crop,
or
a
requirement
that
there
is
a
floor
on
prices
that
will
affect
even
those
who
haven't
joined?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
pose
problems,
in
your
view,
under
the
federal
ac?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
back
to
the
state
action
argument,
aren't
you,
that
you
just
said
i
thought
we
didn't
need
to
consider?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
existing
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
the
michigan
act
was
not
existing
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
the
congress
used
the
word
"existing"
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
white,
certainly
there
is
some
analogy,
i
suppose,
to
the
section
14(b)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
right
to
work
states
versus
the
non-right
to
work
states.
now,
courts
in
those
states
have
differed,
have
they
not,
as
to
whether
the
requirement
of
payment
of
any
agency
shop
fee
by
workers
who
don't
want
to
join
the
union
is
or
is
not
prohibited
under
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
then
certainly
the
result
of
that
holding
is
that
section
14(b)
does
permit
states
to
include
within
the
proscription
of
a
right
to
work
law
not
only
an
actual
union
shop
but
an
agency
or
agency
fee
state.
now,
i
think
there
is
some
analogy
there
to
say...
you
know,
you
are
saying
in
effect
you
are
not
forced
to
join
the
cooperative.
all
you
have
to
do
is
pay
the
same
dues
as
you
would
have
to
if
you
did
join.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
really
why
most
people
don't
want
to
join
the
cooperative,
isn't
it?
it
isn't
some
highminded
belief
that
they
don't
want
to
be
compelled
to
be
a
member
of
something
they
don't...
they
just
don't
want
to
pay
the
fee.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
fee
that
is
paid
here?
is
there
a
standard
fee
for
being
a
member?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
what
members
pay?
unknown
speaker
so
these
people
who
don't
want
to
become
members,
they
just
have...
but
they
pay
the
same
amount
as
other
members.
unknown
speaker
what
is
excluded
from
the
charge
to
them?
what
are
you
rebating?
political
activities,
or
newspapers?
unknown
speaker
litigation
like
this?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
a
curiosity?
do
you
have
any
members
that
are
not
michigan
farmers?
do
they
grow
asparagus
in
indiana,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
i
know
the
act
is,
but
i
was
asking
about
the
co-op.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were
a
michigan
farmer
who
wanted
to
sell
to
an
indiana
buyer,
he
couldn't?
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
co-op
and
sell
only
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
michigan
statute
would
not
prohibit
an
individual
farmer
from
selling
in
indiana
if
he
wanted?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
prevent
him
from
selling
to
any
processor
in
michigan
other
than
the
one
the
bargaining
agent
made
the
deal
with.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
prevent
him
from
selling
to
that
processor
at
a
price
different
from
what
you
negotiated.
unknown
speaker
are
the
members--
unknown
speaker
--are
the
members'
production
controlled
by
the
co-op?
are
there
allocations?
unknown
speaker
well
you
make
him
pay.
what
else
do
you
make
him
do
that
he
wouldn't
do
if
it
weren't
for
this
act?
unknown
speaker
you
make
him
pay
the
money.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
all?
what
other--
unknown
speaker
--what
other
pressure
on
them
is
there?
what
if
he
could
get
a
higher
price?
unknown
speaker
but
could
you
not
in
your
contract
specify
a
specific
price?
legally
you
could.
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
statute,
you
could.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
take
that
position,
does
he,
that
the
federal
act
was
designed
to
confer
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
processors
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
white,
do
you
agree
that
one
purpose
of
the
federal
act
was
to
protect
the
right
of
an
individual
farmer
not
to
join
a
cooperative
marketing
association?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes
or
no
to
my
question.
was
one
purpose
of
the
act
as
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
act
to
protect
the
right
of
an
individual
farmer
not
to
join
an
agricultural
co-op?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
michigan
act
as
a
whole
to
determine
whether
it
provides
what
amounts
to
coercion
to
farmers
to
join
the
co-op?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
we
really
have
to
focus
on?
unknown
speaker
but
you
agree
we
have
to
answer
that
question.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
and
then
in
answering
the
question,
don't
we
have
to
look
at
the
whole
package
of
what
the
michigan
act
does
to
the
farmers
to
determine
whether
it
is
coercion,
not
just
break
it
down,
well,
does
the
fee
alone
do
it,
or
does
this
alone
do
it?
don't
we
have
to
look
at
the
whole
thing
and
answer
whether
that
amounts
to
coercion?
unknown
speaker
and
the
co-op
is
defined
as
a
handler
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
act.
unknown
speaker
although
the
court
in
michigan
didn't
acknowledge
that
in
its
opinion.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
footnote
7?
unknown
speaker
mr.
white,
is
it
not
true
that
the
michigan
statute
is
unique?
it
is
the
first
one
that
has
had
this
particular
feature.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
agree,
mr.
white,
that
fathpa,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
did
also
ensure
some
rights
for
the
individual
farmers
as
against
the
cooperatives,
the
freedom
from
coercion?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
it
was
intended
to
protect
groups
of
farmers,
not
individual
farmers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
white,
you
have
already
said,
though,
that
if
the
michigan
law
required
the
farmer
to
join
the
cooperative,
become
a
member,
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
federal
act.
you
have
already
said
that
in
answering
justice
o'connor,
but
you
say
if
all
you
do
is
make
him
pay
everything,
almost
everything
a
member
would,
and
also
be
bound
by
the
collective
bargaining
result,
like
a
member
would,
the
mere
fact
that
you
don't
issue
him
a
membership
card
protects
the
state
act.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it's--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
do
concede
then
that
that
is
coercion,
the
kind
of
coercion
which
if
done
by
a
handler
would
be
contrary
to
the
federal
act?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can
have
it
if
they
wanted
it.
any
farmer
can
be
part
of
this
collective
action
if
he
wants
to.
unknown
speaker
work,
you
have
to
have
coercion.
unknown
speaker
if
you
won't
do
it
voluntarily,
you
are
going
to
do
it
under
the
hammer.
