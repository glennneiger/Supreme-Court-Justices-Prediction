mr.
james
a.
white
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
generally
stated,
is
whether
the
federal
agricultural
fair
practices
act
of
1967
preempts
the
michigan
agricultural
marketing
and
bargaining
law
of
1972.
section
2305(d)
of
the
federal
act
states
that
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
not
be
construed
to
change
or
modify
existing
state
law,
nor
to
deny
the
proper
state
courts
of
jurisdiction,
clear
congressional
intent
not
to
occupy
the
field
of
farm
bargaining,
and
hence
we
are
presented
in
this
case--
mr.
james
a.
white
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
white
that's
right,
justice
blackmun.
it
was
not
in
existence,
but
i
believe
that
in
reading
the
congressional
intent
from
that
statement,
it
was
that
certainly
the
existing
state
law
or
certainly
anything
that
would
not
be
in
contravention
of
it
or
contrary
to
it.
mr.
james
a.
white
i
think
it
looked
at
the
statute
certainly
that
existed,
and
found
nothing
in
those
statutes
that
was
contrary
certainly
to
the
statute,
or
they
would
have
built
in
their
own
contradiction.
but
i
do
not
read
from
that
further
congressional
limitations
upon
the
state
to
an
otherwise
act
of
legislation
which
was
indeed
a
fulfillment
of
the
overall
objectives
of
the
congress
in
passing
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act.
i
think
the
general
purposes
of
both
the
federal
and
the
state
act
are
in
the
end
the
same.
that
was
to
improve
farmers'
bargaining
power
at
the
bargaining
table
with
processors.
the
appellants
claim
that
there
are
essentially
three
aspects
of
the
michigan
act
which
are
repugnant
to
the
federal
act.
those
are
essentially
the
concepts
of
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
duty
to
bargain,
and
the
fair
share
fee.
let's
first
talk
about
the
fair
share
fee.
they
argue
that
because
under
the
michigan
statute
all
growers
and
farmers
that
are
affected
by
that
or
come
within
the
purview
of
the
bargaining
unit
must
pay
to
the
sole
exclusive
bargaining
representative
a
fee,
that
this
is
coercive
of
their
right
not
to
join.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
payment
of
a
fair
share
bargaining
fee
as
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
system
set
up
by
a
state
is
coercive
of
a
farmer's
right
not
to
join
that
organization
that
may
be
their
sole
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
this
court
implicitly
seemed
to
recognize
in
the
recent
decision
that
we
have
handed
down
within
this
past
month
in
minnesota
community
college
faculty
association
versus
knight
that
the
payment
of
a
fair
share
bargaining
fee
was
not
coercive
of
a
person's
associational
right,
and
although
i
simply...
i
do
not
cite
the
knight
case
for
its
decision.
that
was
certainly
a
first
amendment
case.
i
do
not
cite
that
case
for
its
decision,
but
i
cite
it
because
it
seems
to
me
that
implicit
in
the
decision
of
that
case
is
the
understanding
that
insofar
as
collective
bargaining
is
concerned,
the
payment
of
that
fee
is
not
destructive
of
any
associational
right,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
some
extent
even
the
dissent
in
that--
mr.
james
a.
white
--as
i
understand
what
you
are
talking
about
there,
justice
rehnquist,
is
the...
i
guess
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general
that
under
nlrb
versus
general
motors,
that
that
somehow
indicates
that
there
was
a
congressional
intent
somehow
not
to
require
anyone
to
join
or
not
to
join
when
he
states
that
there
was...
one
was
the
financial
equivalent
of
the
other.
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
analogy
is
appropriate
here,
because
i
thank
that
what
we
were
dealing
there
with
was
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
which
expressly
permitted...
first
of
all,
there
was
pervasive
and
comprehensive
legislation
establishing
a
collective
bargaining
plan
for
workers
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
question
that
was
raised
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
when
congress
indicated
in
section
that
they
could
have
a
union
shop,
that
they
could
negotiate...
the
union
could
negotiate
the
union
shop,
did
that
in
and
of
itself
preclude
the
negotiation
then
of
so-called
lesser
item
of
agency
shop.
and
what
the
court
said
in
essence
as
i
read
nlrb
versus
general
motors
and
the
shemerhorn
case,
cases,
is
that
they
will
let
each
state
interpret
its
own
right
to
work
law.
that
is
up
on
each
individual
state.
mr.
james
a.
white
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
white
i
think
that
even...
that
may
be,
although
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
nlpe
v.
general
motors
that
there
may
be
some
valid
reasons
for
a
person
not
wanting
to
join,
and
he
was
only
talking
in
the
financial
sense
of
them
being
the
equivalent,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case...
or
this
court
in
the
knight
case
made
it
clear
in
the
case
that
the
mere
payment
of
a
fee
to
a
sole
and
exclusive
bargaining
representative
is
not
coercive
of
the
right
to
not
join
or
not
to
be
a
member.
mr.
james
a.
white
yes,
it
is...
at
the
current
time
it
is
1
and
a
half
percent.
mr.
james
a.
white
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
white
not
necessarily,
justice
white.
there
is
a
rebate
provision
under
the
michigan
act,
and
under
the
michigan
act
the
fee
has
to
be
solely
that
which
is
connected
with
the
bargaining
services,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
cooperative
does
and
in
fact
has
under
this
act
rebated
amounts
to
both
members
and
non-members,
and
indeed
the
amount
going
to
non...
being
rebated
to
non-members
is
greater
than
the
amount
being
rebated
to
non-members.
mr.
james
a.
white
well,
our
particular
organization
is
not
particularly
involved
in
a
lot
of
those
types
of
activities,
but
other
types
of
activities
that
would--
mr.
james
a.
white
--possibly.
possibly.
there
are
other
activities
vis-a-vis
the
pure
running
of
the
cooperative
which
are
not
connected
with
that
bargaining
fee,
and
in
fact
under
the
act
the
cooperative
makes
a
report
to
the
agriculture
marketing
and
bargaining
board
each
year,
which
is
again
a
board
appointed
by
the
governor
of
the
state,
and
a
part
of
that
report
must
show
that
amount
which
has
been
used
for
bargaining
services
and
the
amount
of
the
rebates
to
members
and
non-members,
and
that
is...
must
be
done
pursuant
to
the
express
rules
of
the
agricultural
marketing
and
bargaining
board.
mr.
james
a.
white
no,
this
is
strictly
a
michigan
act.
and
it
does
not--
mr.
james
a.
white
--it
does
not.
it
does
not
to
my
knowledge,
and
i
believe
it
does
not.
mr.
james
a.
white
no,
that
would
not...
this
is
not
affected
by
this.
it
is
not
affected
by
this.
mr.
james
a.
white
it
is
only
affected
by
sales
in
michigan
between
michigan
growers
who
are
determined
to
be
within
the
bargaining
unit
and
a
processor
doing
business
in
michigan.
it
would
not
affect
a
michigan
grower
selling
to
someone
in
indiana.
mr.
james
a.
white
that's
right.
the
bulk
of
this
asparagus
is
grown
down
in
the
southwestern--
mr.
james
a.
white
--justice
white,
that
has...
our
act
has
never
worked
that
way,
and
indeed,
under
the
michigan
act--
mr.
james
a.
white
--that
is
right.
that
is
right.
we
negotiate
a
price,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
the
way
the
michigan
act
has
worked,
in
nearly
all
instances
what
we
do
is
negotiate--
mr.
james
a.
white
--a
minimum--
mr.
james
a.
white
--no,
there
have
never
been
any
allocations.
there
have
never
been
any
allocations
amongst
growers,
and
we
do
not
under
this
act
indicate,
grower
a,
you
must
deal
with
processor
x;
grower
b,
you
must
deal
with
processor
y,
something
like
that.
that
has
not
been
negotiated.
and
there
may
be...
it
may
raise
interesting
questions
indeed
if
the
act
went
that
far
as
to
say
that
indeed
you,
farmer
a,
must
deal
with
farmer
b.
that
isn't
to
say
we
don't
have
the
right
under
the
act
to
negotiate--
mr.
james
a.
white
--make
him
pay
the
act,
and--
mr.
james
a.
white
--right,
and
make
him,
abide
by
the
minimum
fee
that...
we
have
up
to
this
point--
mr.
james
a.
white
--made
him
abide
by
the
minimum
price
for,
say,
asparagus
that
we
have
negotiated
with
the
processors.
mr.
james
a.
white
that
is
essentially
it.
mr.
james
a.
white
well,
the
way
the
michigan
act
has
worked,
and
this
has
exactly
happened
several
years,
we
negotiate
a
minimum
price,
and
then
because
of
the
vagaries
of
the
market
or
weather
or
such,
the
farmer
hauls
his
asparagus
to
the
processor,
and
they
can
pay
more,
and
they
have
paid
more.
mr.
james
a.
white
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
white
--in
my
opinion,
legally
we
could,
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
offends
any
concept
set
forth
in
the
federal
act.
i
think
this
is
what
we
have
to
look
at.
whatever
one
may
think
of
collective
bargaining
in
general,
the
question
here
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
agricultural
fair
practices
act
that
is
intended
to
preempt
the
states
from
passing
a
collective
bargaining
scheme
which
entails
the
concepts
of
fair
share
fee,
duty
to
bargain,
and
having
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
we
do
not
find
that.
now,
the
appellants
argue
that
the
disclaimer
language
found
at
2304
which
is
denominated
by
the
congress
as
a
disclaimer
of
intent
to
prohibit
normal
dealing
somehow
establishes
a
federal
right
on
the
part
of
processors
not
to
have
to
deal
with
any,
and
i
think
that
what
the
appellants
consistently
ignore
is
the
first
four
words
of
that
disclaimer,
which
says,
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
prevent.
"
mr.
james
a.
white
the
solicitor
general
does
not
accept
that
argument,
that
particular
argument,
but
the
appellants
strongly
claim
that
that
is
some
kind
of
right.
and
i
think
the
important
thing
as
i
see
it
is
those
words,
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
prevent.
"
what
they
are
saying
is
that
within
this
legislation,
congress
is
not
doing
this,
is
not
setting
up
a
federal
bargaining
act,
not
requiring
this.
it
does
not
say
that
the
states
may
not
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
white
it
was
intended
to
prevent
any
improper
pressures
on
behalf
of
handlers.
mr.
james
a.
white
answering
yes
or
no,
i
would
have
to
say
that
was
one
of
their
intentions,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
white
i
think
we
can--
mr.
james
a.
white
--i
don't
think
that
the
michigan
act
does
that
certainly
insofar
as
the
requirement
to
pay
the
fair
share.
mr.
james
a.
white
i
think
you
do
in
light
of
what
the...
the
plain
wording
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
white
--it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
look
as
to
whether
anything
in
the
michigan
act
amounts
to
handler
coercion,
and
i
think
that
important
from
our
standpoint
is
the
fact--
mr.
james
a.
white
--that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
white
with
that,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
the
appellants
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
recognize
that.
for
example,
at
a-10
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
there
is
a
statement
by
the
michigan
supreme
court
within
their
opinion.
it
says,
"while
2303
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
handler
to
coerce
a
producer
to
join
and
belong
to
association,
it
does
not
forbid
the
state
from
requiring
exclusive
representation
of
individual
producers
where
a
producer
majority
sees
fit.
"
now,
the
first
words
of
that,
where
it
says,
"2303
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
handler
to
coerce
a
producer
to
join
or
belong,
there
was
a
tacit...
there
was
a
recognition
that
they
understood
that
the
federal
act
included
a
definition
of
handler...
they
wouldn't
have
made
that
statement,
because
they
can
assume
the
processors
weren't
going
to
coerce
them
not
to
join.
"
the
other
thing
is,
i
disagree
with
mr.
scoville's
statement
that
section
7
is
any
type
of
a
clear
indication
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
not
understand
that
the
federal
act--
mr.
james
a.
white
--excuse
me,
footnote
7
at
a-5.
the
statement...
footnote
7
reads,
"for
ease
of
reference,
we
use
take
term
"handler"
and
"processor"
interchangeably
in
this
opinion.
"
"although
in
a
way
not
germane
to
our
disposition
of
the
issues,
there
is
a
technical
difference
between
the
two.
"
i
think
they
absolutely...
they
recognized
the
difference
between
the
michigan
and
the
state
act
in
that
the
federal
act
stated
that
a
cooperative
was
also
a
handler
for
the
purposes
of
that
act,
but
they
were
saying
insofar
as
our
determination
is
concerned,
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
determinative
of
our
decision.
so
i
believe
that
they
did
recognize
the
difference.
i
think
that
what
the
state
of
michigan...
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan
was
recognizing
is
the
same
thing
that
congress
recognized
in
the
passage
of
this
act,
and
that
is
the
vulnerable
position
that
the
individual
grower
finds
himself
in
dealing
with
the
process.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
appellants'
argument,
to
accept
the
appellants'
argument
that
this
federal
act
intended
to
prevent
the
states
from
enacting
in
effect
a
collective
bargaining
model
for
growers
just
stands
on
its
head
70
years
of
congressional
history
in
doing
whatever
they
could
to
encourage
collective
action
by
farmers.
going
back
to
the
clayton
act,
exempted
provisions
of
the--
mr.
james
a.
white
--i
think
it
is,
in
that
regard,
justice
stevens,
the
michigan
act
is
unique.
it
is
the
only
one
of
its
kind
in
the
country
at
this
time.
that's
right.
bur
starting
back
with
the
clayton
act
of
1914,
where
farm
organizations
along
with
unions
are
exempted
from
the
operation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
capper-volstead
act
of
1922
further
clarified
that
agricultural
cooperatives
were
free
from
the
restraints
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
agricultural
farm
credit
act
of
1933
established
banks
for
cooperatives.
then
we
have,
of
course,
the
agricultural
fair
practices
act--
mr.
james
a.
white
--yes.
i
think
that
2303(a)
protects
the
farmer
against
coercion
by
a
handler,
which
includes...
which
under
the
federal
act
includes
both
the
cooperative
and
a
processor,
from
coercion
to
join
or
not
to
join,
but
i
think
it
is
important...
look
at...
we
talk
about
legislative
history,
if
i
could
for
just
a
second
here.
looking
at
the
senate
agricultural
committee
report,
they
make
it
absolutely
clear
what
was
intended
to
do.
when
the
state...
in
the
report
of
the
senate
agricultural
committee
in
suggesting
passage
of
this
act,
the
federal
act,
says,
"the
fact
is
clear
that
an
association
of
producers
which
has
obtained
the
voluntary
membership
of
a
large
number
of
farmers
deserves
the
respect
and
recognition
by
handlers
of
agricultural
products.
"
the
house
committee
report
stated,
"this
legislation
is
necessary
in
order
to
give
farmers
and
their
marketing
associations
new
and
greater
market
power.
"
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
years
of
congressional
encouragement
of
farmers
to
enter
into
collective
action
so
as
to
protect
themselves.
this
court
certainly
was
not
unaware
of
the
plight
of
the
farmer.
for
example,
in
the
national
broilers
case,
this
court
clearly
recognized
the
plight
of
the
individual
farmer.
justice
blackmun
indicated
in
that
decision,
"farmers
were
seen
as
being
caught
in
the
hands
of
processors
and
distributors
who
because
of
their
position
in
the
market
and
their
relative
economic
strength
were
able
to
take
from
the
farmer
a
good
share
of
whatever
profits
might
be
available
from
agricultural
production.
"
"by
allowing
farmers
to
join
together
in
cooperatives,
congress
hoped
to
bolster
their
market
strength
and
to
improve
their
ability
to
weather
adverse
economic
periods,
and
to
deal
with
processors
and
distributors.
"
now,
there
again,
this
isn't
determinative.
that
was
a
capper-volstead
case,
and
the
extent
to
which
the
court
would
permit
the
extension
of
the
capper-volstead
protection
to
cooperatives.
but
i
think
throughout
this
we
have
recognition
by
the
courts
and
by
congress
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
farmer,
and
i
understand
that
the
national
food
processors
and
american
food
institute
very
well
may
not
want
to
deal
with
cooperatives,
but
to
say
this
federal
act
which
was
in
effect
very
narrow
in
scope
and
was
intended
to
protect
farmers
had
as
its
intention
to
divest
the
states
of
their
right
to
pass
meaningful
collective
bargaining
things
for
farmers
is
just--
mr.
james
a.
white
--i
think
it
intended...
the
federal
act
intended
to
protect
both
farmers
and
farmers
working
through
their
cooperatives.
it
seems
to
me
that
any
way
you
look
at
it,
what
the
appellants
are
arguing
here
is
that
they
intend
to
take
an
act
which
was
intended
to
be
a
shield
against
improper
processor--
mr.
james
a.
white
--that
is
not--
mr.
james
a.
white
--that
is
not
coercive
evidence.
coercion
is
coercion
by
the
state,
and
it
is
not
coercion
by
a
handler.
mr.
james
a.
white
no.
mr.
james
a.
white
no,
i
do
not...
i
certainly
in
no
way
would
concede
that
that
would
be
the
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they
have
taken
here
is
an
act
which
was
intended
to
be
a
shield
against
improper
conduct
and
turned
it
into
a
sword
with
which
to
divest
the
farmers
of
their
right
to
collective
action.
mr.
james
a.
white
that's
right,
but
in
order
to
make
a
collective
scheme
meaningful--
mr.
james
a.
white
--the
duty
of...
the
duty
to
bargain,
fair
share
membership
fees
are--
mr.
james
a.
white
--otherwise
you
get
the
sweetheart
deals
that...
the
types
of
sweetheart
deals
that
the
testimony
brought
forth
in
this
trial
and
in
the
legislative
hearings
both
before
congress
and
in
michigan,
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate,
in
passing
these
two
acts.
thank
you.
