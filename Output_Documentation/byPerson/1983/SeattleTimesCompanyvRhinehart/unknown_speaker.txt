unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
rest
of
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
unknown
speaker
the
only
things
that
you
sought
had
been
already
been
filed
in
the
public
record?
unknown
speaker
on
the--
unknown
speaker
well,
could
we
take
just
a
little...
let's
take
a
specific
example.
suppose
that
you
had
noticed
a
deposition,
and
you
wanted
it,
and
the
deposition
was
taken,
or
the
other
side
had.
now,
do
you
say
that
even
if
the
deposition
was
never
filed,
never
used
at
court,
that
you
would
have
the
right
to
publish
it?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
just
in
the
possession
of
the
lawyers
and
both
lawyers
say
it
is
none
of
your
business?
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
think...
that
position,
i
take
it,
that
isn't
dependent
upon
your
being
a
defendant
in
the
libel
suit.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
weren't
a
party
to
this
case
and
it
was
just
any
civil
case
in
which
a
deposition
had
been
taken
and
the
results
were
in
the
possession
of
the
lawyers?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
the
press
has
the
right
to
have
access
to
those
depositions?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is...
but
you
certainly
would
say
that
if
a
deposition
was
filed
in
court,
that
you
had
the
right
of
access
to
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
have
got
this...
the
picture
is
a
little
confused
because
your
client
is
a
litigant
and
is
also
seeking
some
information
not
as
a
litigant
but
as
a
representative
of
the
media.
unknown
speaker
what
about
two
private
parties
who
have
a
lawsuit
and
they
are
taking
depositions
pretrial
and
they
are
having
interrogatories,
and
none
of
them
are
filed;
they
remain
in
the
possession
of
the
lawyers?
are
you
suggesting
that
those
are
part
of
the
public
record
until
and
unless
they
are
offered
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
you
answered
to
me
before,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
i
suppose
if
you
were
just...
if
the
press
were
just
a
litigant
in
a
tax
case
in
which
there
were
depositions,
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
arguments
that
you
are
making
here.
i
suppose
the
reason
you
are
making
these
arguments
is
that
you
are
a
defendant
in
a
libel
suit.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not,
what...
in
a
tax
case
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
access?
unknown
speaker
you
have
first
amendment
right
to
publish
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
schwab,
you
are
not
making
that
argument
as
a
litigant.
unknown
speaker
your
right
to
publish,
you
are
making
that
argument
as
a
litigant?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
as
a
news
media
litigant?
suppose
you
were
not?
unknown
speaker
it
would?
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
cases
to
support
you
on
that
from
around
here,
giving
the
press
superior
rights
to
another
litigant,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
publication
further
your
interests
as
a
litigant?
unknown
speaker
before
the
trial
has
been
held?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
asserting
right
as
media,
not
as
a
litigant.
unknown
speaker
publish
in
what,
in
their
journal?
unknown
speaker
to
publish
it
where,
in
their
journal?
unknown
speaker
you
can
use
it
as
a
litigant,
of
course,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are,
i
repeat,
asking
for
a
special
right
because
your
client
happens
to
be
a
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
tell
whether
someone
has
first
amendment
rights
at
stake
in
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
were
arguing
that
any
litigant,
when
he
gets
discovery,
has
a
first
amendment
interest
in
being
able
to
publish
the
results
of
the
discovery.
unknown
speaker
and
just
anybody
in
any
kind
of
a
case.
but
that
isn't
the
same
argument
you
made
two
minutes
ago.
in
any
kind
of
a
case.
unknown
speaker
in
any
kind
of
a
case,
whether
it
is
libel
or
tax
or
science
or
environmental
or
whatever?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
a
defamation
litigant
have
a
greater
first
amendment
right
than
any
other
kind?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
independently,
then,
of
this
being
a
defamation
suit
in
your
argument
for
a
first
amendment
right
to
publish.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
are
talking
only
about
a
litigant's
right,
and
you
are
not
talking
about
a
litigant's
right
who
just
happens
to
be
the
defendant
in
a
libel
suit,
or
you
are
not
talking
about
a
litigant's
right
just
because
he's
a
member
of
the
press.
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
be
your
view,
if
you
postulate
this
hypothetical
question,
proposition,
an
individual
sues
a
bank,
his
own
banker
for
any
reason
you
can
conceive
of.
they
take
a
lot
of
pretrial
discovery
by
way
of
testimony
an
interrogatories,
and
each
lawyer
for
each
side
keeps
them
in
his
own
office,
none
of
them
are
filed.
do
you
say
that
there
is
some
first
amendment
right
of
someone
to
publish
that
information
before
it
is
ever
offered
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
could
one
of
the
litigants
take
a
page
ad,
let's
say,
in
the
seattle
times,
and...
or
two
pages,
even
better,
and
publish
all
these
pretrial
depositions
over
the
objection
of
the
other
party?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make
that
it
was
not
relevant?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
it
was
not
relevant
to
the
issues
if
it
is
material
that
the
public
is
interested
in?
if
relevance
to
the
issues
is
the
determining
factor,
then
you
might
as
well
just
wait
until
the
case
is
tried.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
a
lawyer
who
is
a
free-lance
writer
on
the
side
would
have
the
same
first
amendment
right?
unknown
speaker
he
would?
unknown
speaker
--as
a
representative
of...
well,
are
you
speaking
of
your
client
as
the
press
or
as
a
litigant?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--are
they
they
same?
unknown
speaker
a
fraction
of
it
goes
in.
unknown
speaker
the
preceding
counsel
thought
he
was
obligated
as
a
result
of
discovery
to
file--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
rhinehart's
income
tax
returns
with
the
clerk
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't,
you
wouldn't,
you
wouldn't
say
that...
you
wouldn't
say
that
as
a
plaintiff
furnishing
discovery
under
this
protective
order
that
if
information
was
actually
relevant
and
was
introduced
at
trial
that
the
protective
order
would
prevent
publication?
unknown
speaker
even
though,
even
though,
even
though
technically
you
could
say
the
information
would
be...
if
it
were
published,
would
be
used
for
something
besides
litigation.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
once
it
is
actually
legitimately
filed
in
court
or
used
in
the
litigation,
it
is
open
to
the
public
then.
unknown
speaker
unless
there
is
something
special.
i
suppose
in
trade
secret
cases
and
whatnot
there's
a
lot
of
things
that
remain
sealed
forever.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
claim
any
of
this
information
would
be
sealed
forever
if
it
were
used
in
defense,
legitimately
used
in
defense
or
in
prosecution
of
that.
unknown
speaker
even
subject
to
the...
even
subject
to
the
secrecy
order?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
edwards,
if
your
position
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
is
correct
that
all
these
constitutional
privacy
interests
are
invaded
by
a
discovery
order,
and
mr.
schwab's
position
that
his
clients'
and
all
sorts
of
other
clients'
first
amendment
interests
are
invaded
if
there
is
a
protective
order,
then
isn't
justice
stevens'
earlier
question
to
mr.
schwab
brought
about
in
double,
so
to
speak,
that
every
single
discovery
order
that
a
court
makes
is
now
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
import?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me...
suppose
the
newspaper
had
published
a
story
that
the
main
supporters
to
this
sect
or
this
group
are
the
following
people,
and
you
sued
them
and
said
that's
a
lie,
that's
libelous.
and
the
newspaper
then
said,
well,
gee,
we
at
least,
in
order
to
prove
truth
or
falsity,
we
need
your
membership,
your
contribution
list.
unknown
speaker
now,
would
you
say
that
they
weren't
entitled
to
get
the
contribution
list?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but.
unknown
speaker
you
might
still
be...
you
might
still
win
on
a
protective
order,
though,
and
say
that
we
have
to
furnish
it
if
we
want
to
be
a
plaintiff
in
this
case,
but
it
should
be
furnished
under
a
protective
order.
unknown
speaker
you
just
agreed
that
your
position
is
that
if
it
were
used
at
the
trial
legitimately,
then
it
is
open
to
the
public.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
public
is
entitled
to
be
present
at
the
hearings,
at
pretrial
discovery
depositions?
unknown
speaker
why
does...
if
you
concede,
as
you
seem
to,
that
there
is
no
public
right
of
access
to
the
actual
taking
of
the
deposition,
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
access
to
the
record
of
that
deposition
hearing?
