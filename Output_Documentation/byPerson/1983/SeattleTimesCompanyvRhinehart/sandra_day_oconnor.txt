if
the
court
had
denied
you
discovery
altogether
in
this
order
and
just
said
no,
you
can't
have
it,
would
you
be
here
with
this
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
no
first
amendment
right
to
discovery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
snepp
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
to
be
sure
i
understand,
are
we
dealing
with
two
different
types
of
materials
here,
some
which
haven't
yet
been
produced
and
some
which
have
been
produced
before
there
was
any
protective
order
issued.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
