mr.
evan
l.
schwab
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
action
for
defamation
and
invasion
of
privacy.
the
trial
court,
the
superior
court
of
king
county,
entered
a
protective
order
which
bars
the
defendant
newspapers
and
reporters
from
publishing
certain
types
of
information
acquired
during
discovery.
the
washington
supreme--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--most
of
the
discovery
had
not
been
completed
at
that
point.
some
of
the
discovery--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--yes.
the
discovery
we
had
received
to
that
point
had
been
filed.
rhinehart,
mr.
rhinehart
had
furnished
his
income
tax
returns,
and
they
had
been
filed
with
the
public
file
in
the
king
county
clerk's
office.
the
washington
supreme
court
upheld
the
order,
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
and
remand
because
the
order
violates
our
clients'
first
amendment
rights
of
free
expression.
the
practical
effect
of
the
order
below,
we
submit,
is
to
enjoin--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
i'm
sorry,
sir.
the
information
we
had
received
at
that
point
had
been
filed.
the
protective
order
came
up
in
connection
with
our
motions
to
compel
further
discovery,
and
after
long
motions
over
their
efforts
to
resist
discovery
and
our
efforts
to
get
discovery,
the
trial
court
entered
a
broad
order
compelling
significant
discovery
and
at
the
same
time
entered
the
protective
order
in
question.
we
have
not
received
that
discovery
because
the
trial
court
order
provided
that
they
did
not
have
to
comply
with
it
until
judicial
review
concerning
the
protective
order
was
finished.
so
at
this
point
in
time
we
don't
have
most
of
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
some
of
what
we
were
seeking
was
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk.
most
of
what
we
were
seeking
hadn't
been
turned
over
yet
and
is
still
with
the
respondents.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
on
this
court
order,
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
court
below
reserved
its
final
judgment
on
discovery
until
we
completed
this.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
it
did.
and
it
granted
our
motion,
and
it
ordered
the
discovery,
and
that
discovery
was
deemed
relevant
by
the
state
supreme
court.
both
orders
went
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
it
affirmed
the
order
compelling
discovery
and
ruled
that
the
material
we
sought
was
relevant
to
their
claim
in
our
defenses.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
the
argument
would
be
quite
different.
we
would
be
arguing
that
we
should
have
the
discovery,
that
we
needed
to
defend
ourselves.
we--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--well,
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
a
defamation
action,
your
honor,
in
which
we
are
being
sued
on
allegations
that
we
have
defamed
the
respondents,
there
may
be
some
constitutional
overtones
to
discovery.
this
court
has
erected
certain
tests
for
the
defense
of
these
actions
in
cases
like
new
york
times
and
gertz,
and
in
order
to
defend
ourselves,
we
would
need
that
discovery.
that
might
get
closer
to
the
herbert
v.
landau
kind
of--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--the
question
involves
two
elements.
in
a
pretrial
setting,
if
we
had
taken
the
deposition,
yes,
we
do
assert
that
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
publish
the
contents
of
that
deposition.
now,
in
the--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--yes,
sir.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
access
might
be
dependent.
there
are
access
cases
going
on
around
the
country
right
now
in
which
the
media
is
seeking
access.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
sir,
i
don't
argue
that.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
the
access
questions
are
different.
i
think
i
would
argue
that
the
right
of
access
might
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
deposition
was
used
on
a
motion
or
a
trial
by
the
court,
and
that's
how
the
access
cases
around
the
country
are
going.
and
similarly
with
interrogatories?
frequently
they
are
filed
as
public
records
in
most
courts.
the
answers
are
filed
and
placed
in
the
clerk's
office,
and
of
course,
then
they
are
open
to
the
public
and
can
be
published.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
in
our
state
that's
the
practice.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
now,
normally,
documents
aren't
filed
with
the
clerk.
this
case
was
unique
because
the
respondents
not
only
gave
us
the
tax
returns
but
immediately
filed
them
with
the
clerk's
office.
subsequently,
that
order
was
sealed.
the
court
entered
an
order
sealing
the
clerk's
file
in
the
superior
court,
but
the
respondents
did
not
seek
an
order
to
seal
it
in
the
state
supreme
court
or
here,
and
those
tax
returns
are
now
public
records
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
we
are
seeking
it
as
a
litigant,
sir.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
would...
again,
i
would
like
to
say
the
access
question,
but
we
are
not
seeking
this
under
rights
of
access
but
rather
as
a
litigant,
but
i
think
the
access
questions
are
different,
and
i
think
that
the
depositions
that
are
in
the
files
of
the
lawyers
that
have
never
been
submitted
to
a
court
in
connection
with
a
summary
judgment
motion
or
any
other
kind
of
dispositive
motion
would
probably
be
treated
differently.
and
that's
how
the
lower
courts
are
coming
out.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
believe
so.
but
we
are
seeking
this
material
as
a
litigant,
to
defend
ourselves,
not--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--correct.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
access
cases
are
the
cases
in
which
the
press
as
a
nonlitigant
is
seeking
access
to
the
discovered
information,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
i
think
different
tests
may
well
apply,
and
that
has
not
been
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
civil
discovery
and
civil
proceedings.
but
we
do
think
it
is
a
different
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
think
the
argument
receives...
is
worthy
of
additional
weight
in
a
libel
suit,
but
there
would
also
be
situations
in
other
kinds
of
litigation.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
not
to
access,
sir.
if
we
have
obtained
it
through
discovery...
if
we
are
a
litigant
in
a
tax
case
and
we
put
out
interrogatories--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--to
publish.
we
are
arguing
that
once
we
receive
the
information,
the
first
amendment
affects
our
right
to
publish
that
information.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
sir,
we
are.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
are
arguing...
yes,
we
are
arguing
that
as
a
litigant
we
have
first
amendment
rights
in
the
judicial
process
and
first
amendment
rights
in--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--the
same
argument
would
be
made.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
although
i
think
the
argument
has
greater
force
for
members
of
the
media
and
for
public
interest
advocates
such
as
consumer
groups,
the
naacp,
the
aclu
and
organizations
like
that.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i'm
not
asking
for
superior
rights.
i
think
there
are
a
broad
category
of
litigants
who
have
first
amendment
interests
at
stake
in
litigation.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
there
are
several
ways
publication
can
further
our
interest.
we
are
being
accused
of
writing
false
stories.
if
we
obtain
information
through
discovery
that
corroborates
our
stories,
we
have
an
interest
in
bringing
that
to
the
public's
attention.
a,
it
improves
public--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--before
the
trial
has
been
held,
sir,
and
that's
what
we're
asking.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
but
i
think
the
same
right
would
exist
in
a
nonmedia
defendant.
if,
for
example,
a
consumer
group
is
suing
over
a
polluted
stream,
chemical
wastes,
toxic
wastes
and
so
on,
and
they
learn
through
discovery
that
their
claims
are
true,
that
that
stream
is
polluted,
i
think
they
have
the
same
first
amendment
interest
in
being
free
from
a
judicial
order
that
prevents
them
from
publicizing
what
they
have
learned.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
don't
think
where
is
as
much
the
test
as
whether
they
have
a
right
to
disseminate
it.
the
trial
court
order
in
this
case
gags
us
from
either
disseminating
it
ourselves
or
giving
it
to
other
media
or
using
it
in
any
other
way.
we
are
gagged.
we
are
told
that
once
we
get
this
information,
we
cannot
use
it
for
any
purposes
other
than
preparation
for
trial.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
that's
the
only...
the
only
way
we
can
use
it.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
are
asking
for
a
right
on
behalf
of
anyone
who
has
first
amendment
interests
at
stake
in
a
litigation,
and
that
would
apply
equally
to,
and
particularly,
the
public
interest
advocates.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
depending
upon
the
function
of
the
litigation.
i
am
just
arguing
that
they
have
a
stronger
right,
but
the
argument
i
am
making
would
apply
equally
to
all
members.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
exactly.
that's
our
argument.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i'm
trying
to
say
that
the
public
interest
litigants
might
have
a
stronger
argument,
your
honor,
but
basically
i
am
arguing
that
any
litigant
has
a
protected
first
amendment
interest
in
being
able
to
disseminate
or
use
for
any
purpose--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i
think
lines
can
be
drawn.
we
advocate--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--well,
it's
hard
to
say
people
have
a
greater
first
amendment
right.
i
think
they
all
have
first
amendment
interests.
we
are
suggesting
a
balancing
test
in
our
brief--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i'm
arguing,
yes,
whenever
a
trial
court
presumes
to
freeze
discussion,
i'm
arguing
that
the
court
should
be
required
to
weigh
the
first
amendment
interests
at
stake,
much
like
you
did
in
nebraska
press
v.
stuart,
that
the
first
amendment
considerations
are
entitled
to
a
place
on
the
scale.
now,
sometimes
they
may
not
carry
the
balance,
but
at
least
they
should
be
taken
into
account,
and
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
didn't
do
this.
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
argument.
they
gave
our
first
amendment
rights
virtually--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i'm
saying
the
litigants
themselves
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
if
they
choose
to
make
it
available
to
the
press--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
our
argument,
and
that's
happening
around
the
country
right
now.
i
am
involved
in
a
case
like
that
on
the
west
coast
in
which
the
other
side
did,
as
soon
as
the
depositions
were
taken,
give
them
to
the
press.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
your
honor,
you
don't.
i'm
not
arguing
for
an
absolute
rule.
i
am
arguing
instead
for
a
balancing
test
which
balances
the
first
amendment
considerations.
there
will
be
cases
in
which
an
order
like
the
one
below
can
be
sustained
under
constitutional
analysis.
trademark
cases
might
be
a
good
example,
other
instances
of
commercial
inclination.
there
was
a
recent
decision
from
the
d.
c.
circuit
in
the
tavoulareas
case
in
which
the
court
turned
down
the
washington
post's
request
to
publish
thousands
of
pages
of
depositions
and
documents
after
the
trial
was
over.
mobil
was
the
party
that
had
obtained
the
protective
order,
and
they
were
a
nonlitigant.
they
had
been
forced
to
turn
over
a
tremendous
amount
of
discovery
for
that
libel
action
between
their
president
and
the
washington
post.
after
the
trial
was...
and
they
had
done
so
under
a
protective
order.
after
the
trial
was
over,
the
post
sought
to
unseal
all
that
material.
at
this
points
you
are
dealing
with
a
nonlitigant
and
a
tremendous
mass
of
material
that
was
not
relevant
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
it
was
never
offered
and
used
in
the
tavoulareas
court,
and
the
d.
c.
circuit
said
that
that
material
could
not
be
published.
i
think
that
is
a
different
case
than
the
one
we
had
here--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i
think
that
is
a
factor,
your
honor.
interest
to
the
public
is
another
factor.
the
first
amendment
interest
of
the
one
who
wants
to
publish
it
is
a
factor.
and
we
are
only
arguing
again
for
something
that
weighs
all
of
these
various
considerations.
i
was
using
that
as
an
example.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
in
many
cases
he
would.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
the
first
amendment
applies
equally,
and
one
of
the
cornerstones
of
our
jurisprudence
has
been
that
the
first
amendment
rights
should
not
be
restrained
in
advance.
we...
the
courts
and
your
decisions
have
leaned
more
towards
subsequent
punishment.
in
this
case
it
is
more
akin
to
a
prior
restraint.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
submit,
your
honor--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--that's
correct,
and
that
was
part
of
the
reasoning
that
the
d.c.
court
went
through
in
tavoulareas.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
sound
first
amendment
analysis
because
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases
which
say
that
the
government
cannot
both
confer
a
benefit
when
it
is
conditioned
upon
giving
up
constitutional
rights.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
i
think
snepp
is
distinguishable.
snepp
involved
a
government
employee
and
matters
of
national
security,
and
i
think
the
government
as
an
employer
has
a
much
different
interest
in
the
fiduciary
responsibilities
of
its
employees
than
a
judge
has
in
the
behavior
of
litigants
before
it.
the
seattle
times
in
this
case
is
an
involuntary
litigant.
it
has
been
dragged
into
a
case
against
its
will,
and
we
submit,
by
a
plaintiff
who
uses
defamation
suits
to
stifle
discussion
of
his
affairs,
and
by
getting
this
order,
he
in
essence
has
gagged
us
and
enjoined
a
libel.
i
think
that
is
quite
different
than
the
power
of
government
to
impose
reasonable
restrictions
on
its
employees.
now,
snepp
had
signed
a
contract
that
he
would
submit--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--the
first...
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
either,
either
side.
in
the
absence
of
a
protective
order--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--either
one
of
them
would
have
a
right--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i
think
they
would
have
a
right
to
say
we
don't
want
to
give
it
to
you,
and
then
if
the
newspaper
sought
a
court
order,
we
would
be
under
the
different
line
of
reasoning
of
the
access
cases.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes,
your
honor,
again,
subject
to
the
laws
of
defamation,
right
of
privacy,
subsequent
punishment
and
so
on
if
he
utters
falsehoods.
but
if
he
has
obtained
true
information
and
believes
that
it's
important
to
publish
that,
i
believe
he
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
so.
but
more
importantly,
we're
submitting
that
a
court
cannot
restrain
him,
should
not
restrain
him
in
advance
from
doing
so
without
giving
due
consideration
to
his
first
amendment
rights
on
the
one
hand
and
all
of
the
other
reasons
for
banning
publication
on
the
other
hand.
and
that's
really
what
this
case
is
about,
is
whether
or
not
some
standards
need
to
be
laid
down.
the
courts
below
used
tests
and
standards
which
gave
virtually
no
weight
to
our
first
amendment
considerations.
the
trial
court
basically--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--i'm
sorry,
my
clients'.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
both,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
the
press
does
have
a
special
function.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
they
are
different.
the
press
has
a
special
function
which
this
court
has
recognized
to
convey
newsworthy
information.
it
is
in
the
business
on
a
daily
basis
of
conveying
information.
it
has
been
covering
the
rhinehart
story
for
eleven
years.
it
started
in
1973
and
has
gone
through
1981.
the
effect
of
the
orders
below
are
to
curtail
the
publication
of
the
story
in
midstream.
the
times
has
been
muzzled.
if
it
publishes
anything
more
now
about
rhinehart,
it
runs
the
risk
that
he
will
hail
it
into
court
on
a
contempt
citation
and
make
it
prove
independent
sources.
this
is
the
very
nature
of
censorship.
consequently,
there
have
not
been
further
articles
because
the
long
arm
of
the
court
may
fall
down
on
the
newspaper.
so
i
think
that
both
as
a
litigant
and
as
a
newspaper,
it
has
an
interest
in
advancing
these
considerations.
evidence
was
submitted
to
the
lower
courts
that
the
respondents
have
made
a
practice
of
suing
former
members
and
the
media
whenever
they
are
criticized.
they
have
used
litigation
very
effectively,
and
there
is
information
in
the
record
that
they
brought
over
20
suits
to
silence
the
kind
of
criticism
they
have
been
receiving,
the
kind
of
public
scrutiny
they
have
been
receiving.
this
is
an
organization
which
appeals
to
the
public
for
funds.
rhinehart
himself
goes
out
of
his
way
to
bill
himself
as
one
of
the
most
significant
gurus
on
this
planet.
he
has
conducted
nationwide
exhibitions
of
his
powers,
his
powers
as
a
medium,
his
powers
to
communicate
with
the
dead.
he
claims
that
he
has
the
power
to
bestow
special
powers
on
colored
stones
in
a
way,
and
then
members
are
allowed
to
contribute
certain
sums
of
money,
several
thousands
of
dollars
in
many
cases,
to
acquire
these
stones
that
carry
special
powers.
the
times
has
been
covering
these
articles,
trying
to
bring
this
information
to
the
public,
and
the
effect
of
the
order
below
is
to
stop
that.
i
have
got
the
articles,
and
i
was
going
to
read
the
titles,
but
my
time
is
getting
short,
but
i
would
summarize
the
articles
by
saying
that
they
do
draw
into
question
the
bona
fides
of
the
aquarian
foundation,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
rhinehart
has
the
powers
he
claims.
they
question
whether
or
not
he
is
a
charlatan,
whether
or
not
people
are
being
victimized,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
con
game.
and
as
as
result
of
that,
he
brought
this
suit.
now,
in
the
trial
court
he
obtained
this
order
restraining
publication,
and
it
says
in
advance,
you
may
not
publish
what
you
learn.
and
the
test
used
by
the
trial
court
was
simply
this:
parties
may
be
chilled
from
coming
to
court
if
they
know
that
what
they
say
in
discovery
might
be
published.
and
i
would
contrast
that
with
your
decision
in
globe
newspapers
in
which
the
state
argued
that
minor
victims
might
he
chilled
from
coming
forward
because
they
might
be
chilled,
and
that
was
deemed
an
insufficient
reason.
the
court
speculated
about
this.
it
did
not
make
the
kind
of
findings
you
required
in
the
press
enterprise
decision
on
the
exclusion
of
the
press
from
voir
dire.
there
are
virtually
no
findings
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
state
supreme
court
to
justify
this
restraint.
the
state
supreme
court
approached
it
on
a
prior
restraint
analysis
under
your
decision
in
nebraska
press
and
then
concluded
that
the
interest
of
the
judiciary
in
the
integrity
of
its
discovery
process
is
sufficient
to
overcome
the
strong
presumption
against
prior
restraints
enunciated
in
cases
since
near,
new
york
times,
nebraska
press
and
so
on.
and
the
supreme
court
said
if
any
of
the
harms
mentioned
in
the
rule...
and
that
is
rule
26,
which
is
the
same
as
the
federal
rule...
they
said
if
any
of
the
harms
mentioned
in
rule
26
can
be
avoided,
and
the
major
concern...
and
since
the
major
concern
is
the
facilitation
and
protection
of
the
discovery
process
and
the
parties'
privacy
rights,
then
the
order
can
issue.
and
in
the
ordinary
case,
this
balancing
does
not
require
or
condone
publicity.
the
court
distinguished
all
contrary
authority
around
the
country--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--well,
the
test...
we
are
asking
for
a
test,
and
i
can't
imagine
that
some
information
might
meet
that
test.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
yes.
i
think--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--whenever
parties
are
seeking
orders
to
gag
litigants,
because
that
runs
right
into
their
first
amendment
right
to
access.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
believe
it
does
because
the
first
amendment
protects
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
of
the
press.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we're
not
because
everything
has
stopped
since
this
protective
order
in
june
1981.
it
has
been
in
appellate
courts
on
this
issue.
we
have
had
no
discovery.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
oh,
probably
six
months
or
a
year
after
the
protective
order
had
been
issued.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
it
would
have
come
out
at
trial.
that's
another
one
of
the
vices
of
this
protective
order.
the
test
we
advocate
in
our
briefs
asks
the
court
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
order
is
effective,
and
all
this
is
is
a
temporary
prior
restraint,
which
wasn't
acceptable
in
new
york
times,
in
the
pentagon
papers
case.
they
want
to
silence
it
until
trial.
they
don't
argue
that
it
won't
come
out
at
trial.
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
it
will
be
relevant
and
public
at
trial.
so
we
have
got
a
temporary
restraint
to
gag
us
until
trial,
to
stop
us
from
writing
articles
about
them,
to
stop
us
from
bringing
to
the
attention
of
the
public,
from
whom
they
solicit
funds,
what
we
have
learned
about
the
nature
of
their
organizations.
the
courts
below
were
careful
to
say
we
can
publish
what
we
don't
learn
in
discovery,
but
this
really
puts
us
in
a
pickle.
we...
it's
hard
to
draw
that
line.
how
does
a
reporter
decide
he
can
safely
publish
this
and
not
that
when
the
lawyers
have
amassed
a
great
deal
of
information
through
the
discovery
process?
there
is
a
significant
risk
that
what
you
have
is
a
stifling
effect,
that
the
stories
aren't
written
because
of
the
chilling
effect
on
that
order.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
in
most
cases...
i
think
in
most
cases,
your
honor,
that
really
gets
in
the
way
of
one's
ability
to
prepare
for
trial.
i
have
always
resisted
order
like
that.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
need
to
talk
to
my
client.
i've
got
to
show
him
what's
going
on.
it's
his
lawsuit,
not
mine.
he's
got
the
interest
in
the
case.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
is
a
minimal
risk.
certainly
not...
doesn't
rise
to
the
standard
of
the
kinds
of
fears
expressed
in
nebraska
press
and
some
of
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided.
most
civil
cases
aren't
worth
much
publicity.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think...
i
don't
think
it's
a
significant
risk.
it's
something
the
trial
court
should
take
into
account,
but
there
are
many
other
ways
to
deal
with
possible
jury
prejudice
such
as
effective
examination
by
the
court.
there
are
a
variety
of
things
the
court
can
do,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
we
think
a
court
should
do
under
the
tests
we
ask
for,
which
is
consider
are
there
other
viable
alternatives.
if
i
can
briefly
summarize
the
test
we
would
like
the
court
to
adopt
in
this,
it
would
be
to
enunciate
that
first
amendment
considerations
cannot
be
abridged
for
conjectural
reasons
and
without
detailed
findings.
that
happened
in
this
case.
neither
of
those
were
entered,
and
there's
really
no
way
for
an
appellate
court
to
come
to
grips
with
the
basis
for
the
lower
court
decisions.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
the
essence
of
their
damage--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--financial
affairs
and
information
about
the
contributors.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
there
would
be
more.
we
haven't
got
the
balance
sheets
or
other
financial
information,
but
yes.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
they
injected
that
issue
into
the
lawsuit.
if
they
are
making
an
issue--
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
--we
would...
if
it
was
something
we
needed
to
pursue
discovery
in
to
defend,
yes,
then
i
am
arguing
that
we
have
a
right
also
to
disseminate
that
information.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
we
would
argue
that
at
least
a
court
should
balance
the
first
amendment
rights
of
expression
that
are
at
stake,
and
then
it
should
closely
examine
and
scrutinize
the
alleged
harm.
why
is
the
party
seeking
a
protective
order?
what
harm
is
it
trying
to
avoid?
detailed
findings
are
required
because
you
do
have
first
amendment
considerations
on
the
other
side.
the
court
should
ask
whether
the
order
is
effective.
if
it
is
going
to
come
out
at
trial
anyway,
then
the
order
will
not
be
effective;
it
is
merely
a
temporary
or
prior
restraint.
if
one
says
my
privacy
rights
are
being
trod
upon
and
yet
he
has
chosen
to
bring
suit
on
that
information
which
will
become
public
at
trial,
he
necessarily
has
already
decided
to
let
that
go
public.
litigants
make
that
choice
every
day
in
deciding
whether
to
bring
suit.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
well,
he
means...
puts
it
at
issue.
discovery
will
ensue.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
of
course
it
doesn't.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
no,
i
think
we
do
have
final
judgment,
your
honor,
because
the
order,
restraining
order
is
final
and
effective.
it
restrains
us
from
publishing
what
we
have
already
learned
or
may
learn
through
discovery.
we
sought
interlocutory
review,
which
was
granted,
and
the
state
supreme
court
dealt
with
it
as
a
final
order
and
has
affirmed
the
protective
order.
we
are
not
restrained,
and
we
are
asking
this
court
to
lift
the
restraint.
we
are
operating
under
a
form
of
an
injunction
right
now.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
thank
you,
sir.
i
think
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
constitutionalize
pretrial
discovery
if
this
court
adopts
the
balancing
test
we
are
advocating,
and
if
it
requires
lower
courts
to
enter
findings
and
give
justifications
for
these
restraints
on
speech,
is
a
question
that
was
really
decided
by
the
framers
of
our
constitution
and
the
drafters
of
the
first
amendment.
the
first
amendment
has
been
expanded
by
this
court
already
to
in
essence
constitutionalize
or
make
federal
questions
out
of
courtroom
closure
cases,
out
of
the
ability
of
the
press
to
publish
information
that
the
judicial
system
is
trying
to
keep
secret,
such
as
the
judicial
probe
in
the
landmark
case,
the
names
of
minor
victims
in
the
globe
case.
the
court
has
constitutionalized
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
fair
trial
interests
of
the
press...
excuse
me,
the
fair
trial
interests
of
a
defendant,
in
globe...
in
nebraska
press,
justify
protective
orders
against
the
press
like
the
one
that
was
entered
there.
in
smith
v.
daily
mail
this
court
held
that
a
newspaper
could
not
be
punished
for
violating
a
state
statute
and
publishing
the
names
of
minor
offenders.
there
are
a
whole
range
of
cases
in
which
these
issues
have
come
up.
and
yes,
we
do
argue
that
whenever
government,
by
whatever
form,
attempts
to
suppress
speech,
particularly
in
advance
of
that
speech,
then
the
first
amendment
is
called
into
question,
federal
questions
are
present,
and
we
believe
that
in
most
cases
orders
that
suppress
speech
in
advance
cannot
pass
muster
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
started
us
down
this
line
in
near
v.
minnesota.
the
exceptions
there
to
prior
restraints
were
basically
obscenity,
fighting
words
and
national
security
cases.
after
the
pentagon
papers
case
it
appears
that
there
is
not
a
lot
left
of
the
national
security
exception.
when
one
reads
this
court's
opinion
dealing
with
the
public
administration
of
justice,
the
right
of
the
public
to
know
how
its
courts
are
administered,
how
justice
is
administered
and
the
protections
it
has
afforded
those
who
disseminate
information
about
the
administration
of
justice,
then
we
submit
that
one
can
only
conclude
that
there
are
significant
first
amendment
interests
at
stake
here,
and
they
need
to
be
balanced.
we
are
not
arguing
for
an
absolute
test.
we
are
arguing
for
a
balancing
test
that
gives
first
amendment
considerations
a
place
on
the
scale.
the
lower
court
didn't
do
that,
and
basically
said
protective
orders
are
per
se
constitutional
so
long
as
they
avoid
embarrassment
and
the
other
things
listed
in
rule
26.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i'm
a
trial
litigator
most
of
the
time,
and
i
would
say
no.
i
don't
want
the
public
and
the
press
in
most
of
these
depositions.
now,
that
is
taken
care
of
in
the
antitrust
field
because
there
is
a
statute
that
government
prosecutions
involve
right
of
open
depositions.
but
short
of
that,
i
think
not.
mr.
evan
l.
schwab
i
think
the
difference,
sir,
is
that
when
a
litigant
comes
into
possession
of
it
rightfully,
he
has
a
right
to
disseminate
it,
and
he
has
come
into
it
rightfully.
he
was
there.
the
party
was
in
the
room
and
heard
the
deposition.
