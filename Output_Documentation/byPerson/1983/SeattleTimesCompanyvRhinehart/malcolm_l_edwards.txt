mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
chief
justice
burger,
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
a
few
of
the
concerns
that
were
discussed
in
opening
argument,
namely,
what
kind
of
information
are
we
dealing
with
here
to
which
this
protective
order
will
apply.
it
does
apply
to
some
information
that
is
a
matter
of...
that
was
filed
in
a
court
file,
and
let
me
explain
how
that
happened.
a
deposition
of
reverend
rhinehart
was
taken
by
the
seattle
times.
in
that
deposition
questions
were
asked
about
financial
matters
relating
to
the
foundation
and
to
reverend
rhinehart.
there
was
in
that
deposition
a
promise
that
this
information,
financial
information,
would
not
be
disclosed,
it
would
not
be
used
for
any
purpose
other
than
for
the
lawsuit.
as
a
result
of
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--by
counsel
for
the
seattle
times.
as
a
result
of
that
promise,
the
income
tax
returns
of
reverend
rhinehart
were
turned
over
to
the
seattle
times.
reverend
rhinehart
at
that
time
was
represented
by
a
different
counsel
who
thought
he
had
to
also
file
them,
and
he
did
file
them.
once
it
was
discovered
that
the
income
tax
returns
were
filed
by
this
counsel,
we
moved
to
have
those
income
tax
returns
removed
from
the
public
record
so
that
the
policy
and
the
theory
behind
the
production
of
those
income
tax
returns,
namely,
that
they
are
to
be
used
only
for
the
purposes
of
this
lawsuit,
would
be
implemented.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
which
obviously
he
wasn't.
okay.
thereafter,
the
seattle
times
sent
out
a
substantial
number
of
interrogatories
and
requests
for
production.
we
then
resisted
the
disclosure
of
some
of
the
information
that
they
requested,
and
we
asked
if
that
information
was
compelled
to
be
disclosed,
that
a
protective
order
be
entered
on
it.
the
trial
court
entered
a
protective
order
after
directing
us
to
provide
this
information
in
answer
to
the
interrogatories.
now,
what
kind
of
information
does
this
protective
order
apply
to?
it
applies
to
a
very
limited
class
of
information.
it
applies
only
to
the
names
of
the
members
and
donors
to
the
aquarian
foundation
and
its
spiritual
leaders,
and
financial
information
relating
to
the
foundation
and
its
spiritual
leaders.
the
order...
and
i
think
this
is
critical...
does
not
gag
the
seattle
times
in
any
way.
the
seattle
times
is
free
to
publish
anything
it
cares
to
publish
as
long
as
it
has
a
source
that
is
independent
of
court-compelled
discovery.
so
all
we
are
dealing
with
is
whether
the
court
can,
when
it
orders
a
party
to
reveal
or
disclose
information,
make
that
a
limited
disclosure
of
information,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
trial
court
did.
the
aquarian
foundation,
reverend
rhinehart,
other
plaintiffs,
you
are
required
to
provide
this
information,
but
your
disclosure
will
be
limited,
limited
to
the
purpose
of
this
lawsuit.
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
this
order
also
applies
only
to
parties.
this
order
does
not
purport
to
gag
any
member
of
the
press
or
the
public
about
anything.
it
simply
says
that
as
a
party
to
this
process,
you
used
your
rank
as
a
party
to
get
access
to
this
information;
you
must
limit
your
use
to
the
purpose
for...
that
you
used
to
obtain
it.
now,
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
there
are
no
cases
of
this
court
which
relate
to
that
kind
of
a
problem.
the
landmark
case
in
which
a
newspaper
acquired
information
about
a
judicial
discipline
proceeding
involved
a
nonparty
to
that
judicial
discipline
proceeding,
and
the
court
held
that
that
party
could
not
be
restrained
from
publishing.
the
court
went
to
great
lengths
to
note
that
it
was
not
deciding
that
a
party
to
the
proceeding
could
not
be
compelled
to
maintain
the
secrecy
of
the
proceeding.
what
we
have
here
in
this
particular
case
is
an
order
which
applies
to
normally
private
information.
indeed,
the
information
to
which
this
order
applies
is
ordinarily
constitutionally
protected.
this
court
has
held
in
naacp
v.
alabama,
in
brown
v.
socialist
workers
party,
in
detroit
edison
v.
nlrb,
and
in
shelton
v.
tucker
that
certain
private
kinds
of
information
about
members
and
donors
of
minority
faiths
or
minority
associations
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
the
party
is
not
required
to
disclose
it
because
to
do
so
would
subject
the
party
to
reprisal
or
oppression.
and
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
we
have
a
minority
faith
who
wishes
to
protect
the
names
of
its
donors
and
of
its
members.
they
have
rights
of
free
exercise
of
religion,
rights
of
free
association,
rights
of
privacy
that
are
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
just
as
is
freedom
of
the
press.
and
these
rights
need
to
be
protected
by
the
courts
to
the
same
extent
as
do
the
press
rights,
and
the
trial
court
held
that
the
way
to
do
that
was
to
enter
a
protective
order.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
they
give
up
rights
of
privacy
when
they
are
plaintiffs
only
for
the
purposes
of
that
lawsuit,
and
the
fact
that
they
are
plaintiffs
i
think
is
something
that
you
can
make
too
much
of,
your
honor.
a
party
has
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts.
they
aren't
worse
than
a
defendant
because
they
go
to
court.
they
are
not
worse
than
a
plaintiff
because
they
are
a
defendant.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
mm-hmm.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
i
am
saying
that
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
right
that
anyone
has
in
our
society
is
to
go
into
court
and
redress
a
grievance.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
okay.
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
the
due
process
rights
that
every
citizen
of
this
nation
has,
and
it
is
not
just
my
idea.
in
marbury
v.
madison
in
1803
the
chief
justice
noted
that
that
was
the
most
fundamental
civil
liberty
that
anybody
had,
was
the
right
to
seek
redress
for
grievances
in
the
courts.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
the
chief
justice
was
not
talking
in
terms
of
a
libel
case
in
the
king
county
superior
court.
the
chief
justice
was
talking
in
terms
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--yes.
he
could
have
even
been
talking
natural
law.
he
had
very
few
precedents
on
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that
is
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
i
don't
think
so,
but
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--no,
your
honor,
and
the
opinion
of
our
state
supreme
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--that
is
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
i
think
the
public
interest
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--that's
possible.
there
are
juvenile
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--that
is
correct.
we
have
another
petition
for
certiorari
pending
in
which
we
assert
that
the
trial
court
was
in
error
in
compelling
us
to
disclose
the
lists
of
names
and
donors.
that
petition
was
filed
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
the
one
that
is
now
being
argued,
and
it
hasn't
been
acted
on,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
order
compelling
the
respondents
here
to
provide
this
information
was
erroneous
because
it
infringed
upon
their
rights
of
free
exercise.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
yes.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
i
think
there
is
not
any
question
but
that
the
position
being
advanced
here
by
the
petitioner
is
that
the
rule
this
court
should
announce
should
apply
to
all
litigation
and
all
parties
without
regard
to
whether
they
are
newspapers
or
pamphleteers
or
anyone,
and
that
if
the
rule
advanced
by
petitioner
is
supported,
that
you
will
constitutionalize
all
protective
order
questions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
mm-hmm.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that
isn't
the
context
in
which
this
case
arises,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
--under
those
circumstances,
they
would
have
a
more
compelling
reason
to
get
the
contribution
lists
than
they
do
here.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that
is
the
position
we
took
at
trial.
if
you
are
going
to
make
us
give
this
information,
then
at
least
let's
limit
its
use
for
the
reason
you
are
ordering
us
to
produce
it,
namely,
the
litigation
itself.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that's
what
the
state
supreme
court
opinion
says,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that
is
correct.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
state
supreme
court
in
adopting
the
rule
that
one,
in
order
to
have
a
protective
order
entered,
must
show
good
cause
under
civil
rule
26,
i
am
sure
had
some
of
the
same
concerns
that
have
been
expressed
here
about
constitutionalizing
the
process
of
discovery.
it
is
already
sufficiently
complex
and
protracted
that
to
make
every
protective
order
a
matter
of
constitutional
rights
certainly
is
not
going
to
help.
the
state
supreme
court
held
essentially
that
if
you
subject
a
party
as
the
price
of
going
to
court
with
the
cost
of
publication
of
private
information
obtained
through
court-compelled
discovery,
that
you
are
going
to
chill
a
party's
access
to
the
courts,
and
that
is
a
real
concern
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
party
that
is
a
minority
religion,
as
is
the
aquarian
foundation,
or
a
party
that
may
be
a
minority
political
party,
or
a
group
such
as
the
naacp
that
may
be
operating
in
an
area
where
its
objectives
are
ones
that
would
subject
people
to
scorn.
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
that
the
access
to
the
court
was
what?
mr.
malcolm
l.
edwards
yes,
that
the
access
to
the
court
was
a
fundamental
concern
of
theirs,
and
essentially
what
they
said
is
the
only
alternative
the
seattle
times
has
really
presented
that
is
realistic
is
denial
of
discovery
altogether,
and
obviously
if
you
deny
discovery,
they
don't
have
anything
to
publish,
so
they
don't
have
any
reason
to
have
a
protective
order,
and
we
would
all
be
happy
and
could
go
home,
because
that's
what
we'd
like,
too,
is
that
they
not
be
able
to
give
this
information.
but
the
court
said
that
is
not
a
realistic
alternative
because
of
the
importance
of
the
discovery
process
in
the
just
resolution
of
disputes.
given
that,
the
state
supreme
court
said
that
whatever
limited
interest
there
may
be
in
the
right
to
publish
this
material
obtained
through
court-compelled
disclosure
is
far
outweighed
by
the
need
of
the
state
to
have
a
system
to
resolve
disputes,
and
it
is
very
easy
when
we
read
the
briefs,
particularly
of
the
petitioner
here,
to
forget
the
central
fact,
and
that
is
that
we
are
in
that
court
right
now
and
we
have
been
here
in
this
court
and
other
courts
trying
to
vindicate
rights.
and
without
an
effective,
functioning
court
system,
none
of
these
rights
are
going
to
be
very
meaningful.
and
the
washington
supreme
court
held,
as
i
think
this
court
should,
that
that
interest
is
paramount
to
any
right
of
anyone
to
publish
court-compelled
discovery.
