chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart.
mr.
schwab,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
were
these
papers
filed
at
the
time
they
were
sought,
mr.
schwab?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
it
on
file
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'm
afraid
my
question
wasn't
really
clear
enough.
ordinarily,
the
returns
on
pretrial
proceedings,
discoveries,
interrogatories,
are
not
on
file
in
the
clerk's
office.
they
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
lawyers
until
they
are
offered
in
evidence.
now,
were
these
things
that
you
were
seeking
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk
or
still
in
the
possession
of
the
lawyers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
you
have
two
lawyers
in
some
heavy
litigation
of
the
kind
we
are
talking
about
who
are
dismayed
at
the
prospect
of
the
excessive
cost
of
pretrial
discovery
and
interrogatories,
and
they
agree
informally
that
plaintiff's
lawyer
will
submit
a
series
of
informal
questions
by
letter
to
the
defendant's
lawyer,
and
they
will
reciprocate,
and
these
will
be
answered
informally,
and
yet
with
a
stipulation
both
ways
that
to
the
extent
relevant
to
the
case,
if
it
ever
goes
to
trial,
these
may
be
used
in
evidence
as
admissions.
now,
this
is
all
in
the
lawyers'
offices.
you
say
someone
has
a
first
amendment
right
to
publish
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
would
have
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
either
side.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
about,
what
about
demand
of
the
local
newspaper
to
get
at
those
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
either
litigant
could
take
a
coupe
of
pages
in
the
local
newspaper
and
put
it
all
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
our
first
amendment,
now,
are
you
speaking--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
risk
in
this
process
of
making
it
very
difficult
or
even
impossible
to
get
a
jury
that
hasn't
heard
a
lot
about
the
evidence
before
the
case
comes
to
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
other
cases
you're
referring
to
didn't
always
have
that.
nebraska
and
stuart
did,
but
you
say
that's
no
risk
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
what
you
postulate,
he
means
to
have
it
go
public
when,
as,
and
if
it
gets
into
the
courtroom
but
not
before,
necessarily,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
suggesting
that
all
of
the
material
that
is
covered
by
pretrial
discovery
goes
in
evidence
in
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
will
not
be
charged
with
that
time,
counsel.
mr.
edwards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
one
answer
to
the
question
posed
to
you
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
washington
at
least
gave
that
right
to
all
the
people
in
washington?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's...
you
don't
need
to
go
beyond
that
to
find
it
in
the
federal
constitution,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
once
the
deposition
or
the
interrogatory
is
offered
in
evidence,
it
would
lose
any
right
of
privacy,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless,
as
suggested,
it
was
a
patent
case
or
a
national
defense
case,
something
of
that
type.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
schwab?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
capital
cities
cable
v.
crisp.
