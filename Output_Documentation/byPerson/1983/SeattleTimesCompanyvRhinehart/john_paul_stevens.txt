mr.
schwab,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
would
you
concede
that
any
of
the
information
that
is
gong
to
be
obtained
through
discovery
could
be
made
subject
to
a
protective
order
if
it
was
properly
drafted
and
made
a
lot
of
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
long
as
some
is,
isn't
it
a
virtual
certainty
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
federal
question
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
such
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we're
going
to
have
to
we're
the
last
court
of
resort
for
discovery
all
over
the
country
if
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
every
good
cause
for
a
protective
order
raises
a
first
amendment
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this,
too.
how
soon
will
this
case
be
tried?
how
close
are
you
to
a
trial
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
there
not
been
an
appeal
from
the
protective
order,
how
soon
do
you
suppose
you
would
have
been
ready
for
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that
had
happened,
then
you
could
have
gone
in
and
asked
for
all
the
information
to
be
released.
there's
no
longer
any
need
for
secrecy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
just
adopted
a
policy
of
not
having
the
lawyers
turn
anything
over
to
their
client?
sometimes
a
discovery
order
just
restricts
the
access
to
the
information
to
the
lawyers.
then
by
definition,
whatever
the
newspaper
published
would
be
gotten
elsewhere.
i
suppose
you
couldn't
prepare
for
trial.
i
suppose
that's
your
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
that
tough
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
i
am
sorry,
i
hate
to
use...
is
it
perfectly
clear
we
have
a
final
judgment
here?
this
case
hasn't
been
tried
has
it?
