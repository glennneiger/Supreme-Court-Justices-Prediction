justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schwab,
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
tell
me
whether
the
issue
that
is
primarily
involved
in
this
case
is
limited
to
names
and
amounts
of
contributors
to
the
defendant...
to
the
plaintiff
organization,
names
and
amounts
of
money
contributed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
the
essence
of
what
you
are
interested
in.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
they
are
tax
returns,
you
are
not--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--well,
suppose
instead
of
the
party
who
claimed
it
had
been
libeled
were
one
of
the
nationally
known
ministries,
protestant,
catholic,
mohammedan,
whatever,
with
millions
of
subscribers,
members
and
donors,
your
position
would
have
to
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
let's
suppose
a
newspaper
made
the
sort
of
claims
that
have
been
made
according
to
the
pleadings
here
in
this
case,
they
were
sued
for
libel--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--so
the
fact
that
this
particular
sect,
rhinehart's
organization,
is
as
you
characterize
it
something
of
a
charlatan
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it,
in
terms
of
your
theory?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
none
whatever.
