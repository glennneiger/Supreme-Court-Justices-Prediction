justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that...
so
far
as
that
stuff
is
concerned,
your
right
of
access
to
it
really
depends
on
the
court
order,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
your
original
right
of
access
to
it
under
the
discovery
rules
depended
on
the
decision
of
the
superior
court
in
washington
to
grant
your
discovery.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
a
sense,
the
order
that
conditions
your
access
to
the
discovery
is
of
the
same
parcel
with
the
order
that
granted
you
discovery,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
schwab,
in
both
your
answers
to
the
chief
justice's
question
and
to
justice
blackmun,
you
refer
to
access
cases
and
then
intimate
this
is
not
an
access
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
define
an
access
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
argue
that,
mr.
schwab,
because
the
superior
court
should
have...
could
have
said
no,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
any
discovery
in
this
case.
we
follow
this
rule
that
when
you
get
into
very
private
subjects,
we
just
don't
allow
discovery.
why
can't
the
superior
court
equally
well
say
that
we
will
allow
discovery
here,
but
as
a
condition
to
this
access
that
we
are
granting
you
to
this
information,
you
are
not
to
publish
it?
i
don't
see
how
you
could
call
that
a
prior
restraint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
the
access
that
you
get
is
made
conditional
in
the
very
granting
of
the
access.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
promise
made
by
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
your
clients
were
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit,
weren't
they,
mr.
edwards,
and
to
a
certain
extent
they
do
give
up
rights
of...
to
a
very
large
extent
they
give
up
rights
of
privacy
when
you
bring
a
lawsuit
for
libel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
just
a
minute.
you
say
a
party
has
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
are
you
saying
that
is
some
kind
of
an
independent,
federal,
constitutional
right
to
go
into
the
superior
court
of
king
county
and
plead
a
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay,
now.
where
does
one...
from
what
source
does
one
get
a
right
to
go
into
the
superior
court
of
king
county
and
sue
a
newspaper
for
libel
or
sue
anybody
for
anything
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
he
say
that
was
a...
did
the
chief
justice
say
that
was
a
federal
constitutional
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
talking
natural
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
find
a
federal
right
of
access
to
courts
to
sustain
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
this
case
because
they
found
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
that
the
access
to
courts
was
all-important.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
all-important,
or
very
important.
