unknown
speaker
this
was
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
could
just
have
a
general
statute
that
generally
imposed
some
kind
of
qualifications
for
holding
a
union
office?
for
example,
what
if
a
state
statute
said
no
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony
may
be
president
of
any
labor
union
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
think
you
may
achieve
the
same,
almost
the
same
result
by
imposing
sanctions?
i
mean,
if
the
sanctions
are
legal,
it
is
going
to
be
awfully
hard
for
those
officers
to
stay
in
office.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
in
the
casino
context,
would
you,
that
the
state
could
just
flat
outright
prohibit
them
from
holding
office.
they
wouldn't
have
to
go
about
it
indirectly.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
your
position?
unknown
speaker
did
he
write
for
the
court?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
were
five
votes
in
his
opinion?
unknown
speaker
does
the
dues
collection
ban
extend
only
to
members
of
the
union
who
are
employed
in
the
casino
industry?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
suggest,
would
you,
that
new
jersey
could
say
that
unless
a
so-called
disqualified
official
resigns
the
union
may
not
act
as
collective
bargaining
agent?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
pretty
well
cripple
a
union
acting
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent
if
it
can't
get
any
money
to
perform
its
job.
unknown
speaker
well,
think
of
how
much
more
effective
remedy
it
would
be
to
say
they
can't
act
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent
unless
this
official
resigned.
unknown
speaker
mr.
parrillo,
what
are
the
numbers
involved
here,
the
total
numbers
of
members
of
the
union
and
those
whose
dues
would
be
withheld?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
pretty
much
cripple
the
operation,
i
suppose,
of
the
union.
we
should
just
assume
that
in
answering
this
question,
shouldn't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
collective
bargaining
units,
are
they
individual
casinos?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit?
do
they
bargain
for
all
of
them?
or
do
they
bargain
individually?
unknown
speaker
were
you
going
to
address
the
younger
abstention
question
at
all?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
the
prosecuting
end.
unknown
speaker
and
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
it
is
waived?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
the
case
of
local
926
versus
jones,
decided
in
1983,
cuts
back
on
hill
against
florida,
where
the
jones
opinion
indicated
that
something
that
touches
on
interests
so
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling
and
responsibility
requires
a
balancing,
and
could
tip
it
the
other
way?
should
we
read
that
as
any
modification
of
hill
against
florida?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
do
you
think
hill
remained
absolutely
unimpaired
by
the
deveau
opinion,
which
was
four-one-three,
with
justice
harlan
not
participating?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
section
8
itself
was
not
approved
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
what
if
another
state,
what
if
connecticut
had
come
up
with
a
law
just
like
section
8
of
the
new
york
statute
that
was
upheld
in
deveau
against
praisted?
they
had
not...
they
were
just
operating
by
themselves.
they
weren't
operating
under
a
compact.
and
their
argument
was,
well,
surely
if
congress
would
have
approved
it
for
new
york
and
new
jersey,
they
would
likewise
have
approved
it
for
connecticut.
now,
should
they
prevail?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
what,
if
anything,
in
the
federal
law
would
prevent
the
state
of
new
jersey
from
passing
a
law
that
says
that
there
are...
establishing
certain
qualifications
for
union
officers
in
its
gaming
or
casino
industry?
any
union
who
has
a
collective
bargaining
agent
can't
have
an
officer
that
is
so
and
so,
and
going
farther
than
the
federal
law.
would
that
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
that
is
another
branch
of
your
substantive
supersession--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
impossible
to
comply
with
both.
it
isn't
a
square
conflict
in
the
sense
that
you
couldn't
comply
with
both
the
federal
and
the
state
law.
you
have
to
establish
that
congress
intended
that
the
states
establish
no
stiffer
qualifications.
unknown
speaker
there
aren't
any
case
here
squarely
on
on
that,
are
there?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
already...
i
did
that.
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
federals
just
plainly
occupied
the
field
on
this?
unknown
speaker
what
if
new
jersey
enacts
a
statute
saying
that
no
one
may
be
employed
in
a
casino
who
has
been
guilty
of
conviction
of
the
following
felonies,
and
it
includes
some
felonies
that
the
landrum-griffin
act
does
not
include
as
barring
union
office,
and
the
union
complains
and
says,
we
ought
to
have
a
right
to
vote
for
any
union
member
for
shop
steward,
and
now
there
are
people
who
can't
work
here
who
would
otherwise
be
members
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
may
be
here
again,
then.
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
win
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
let
me
ask
you
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
concern
about
whether
deveau
out
back
on
hill
at
all.
there
is
the
one
sentence
that
i
have
looked
at
several
times
toward
the
bottom
of
page
152
of
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
which
he
says,
"obviously,
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
exclude
every
state
policy
that
may
in
fact
restrict
the
complete
freedom
of
a
group
of
employees
to
designate
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
"
do
you
think
that
sentence
is
consistent
with
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
earlier
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
do
you
say
about
his
reliance
on
the
wisconsin
case?
the
public
utility
case.
