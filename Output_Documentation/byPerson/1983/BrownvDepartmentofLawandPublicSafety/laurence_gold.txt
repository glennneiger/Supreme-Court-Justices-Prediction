mr.
laurence
e.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
argument
in
this
case
that
the
state
law
is
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
rests
on
hill
versus
florida.
we
have
set
out
the
essence
of
the
reasoning
in
hill
on
pages
15
through
17
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief.
hill
was
a
case
concerning
a
florida
statute
which
prohibited
individuals
who
were
not
citizens
of
ten
years'
standing
who
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
or
who
were
not
judged
to
be
of
good
moral
character
from
serving
as
union
officers.
moreover,
the
statute
had
certain
registration
requirements
and
enforced
those
requirements
as
well
as
the
requirement
i
have
just
stated
by
injunctive
and
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so,
for
the
following
reason.
as
this
court
has
recognized
throughout
the
development
or
the
modern
development
of
the
preemption
doctrine
in
labor
law,
there
are
two
distinct
parts,
or
maybe
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
there
are
two
distinct
doctrines.
one
concerns
substantive
supersession,
situations
in
which
the
state
law
conflicts
directly
with
the
federal
law,
and
where
under
all
normal
supremacy
clause
analysis,
and
going
back
to
cases
like
hines
versus
davidovitz,
there
would
be
preemption.
the
second
doctrine
is
the
doctrine
based
on
the
primary
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board,
and
that
doctrine
was
first
stated
in
the
garman
case
in
359
us,
whereas
hill
was
decided
back
in
325
us
in
1945.
the
court
has
made
clear,
and
jones
is
a
garman
case,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
garman
doctrine
for
state
regulation
deeply
rooted
in
local
feeling,
and
that
that
exception
to
the
garman
doctrine
is
to
be
administered
through
a
balancing
test.
it
isn't
simply
that
the
state
interest
may
be
deeply
rooted,
but
it
also
concerns
the
relative
impact
on
the
board's
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
case
of
which
we
are
aware
in
the
other
branch
of
the
doctrine
that
concerning
substantive
supersession,
which
employs
a
balancing
test,
and
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
happenstance.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
a
principal
distinction
between
these
two
different
types
of
preemption.
it
is
not,
with
all
deference
to
this
court,
to
balance
where
there
is
a
substantive
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law.
as
noted
in
a
very
recent
case
which
we
cited
and
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
41,
the
fidelity
federal
savings
and
loan
versus
de
la
costa,
a
case
which
is
in
458
us.
where
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
substantive
conflict,
the
determination
is
that
congress
has
weighed
the
different
interests,
and
no
matter
what
the
state
law
means
to
the
state,
the
supremacy
clause
applies.
the
garman
rule
is
a
more
far-reaching
rule
than
substantive
supersession.
it
guards
against
potential
conflicts
in
administration
which
may
have
an
effect
on
the
law,
a
potential
conflict
which
the
court
has
determined
is
inconsistent
with
congress's
plan
in
setting
up
its
single
administrative
agency
in
elaborating
that
doctrine,
as
i
say,
because
it
is
more
far-reaching,
and
because
the
conflict
is
different
kind,
the
court
has
applied
a
balancing
test.
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
one
of
the
three
principal
arguments
made
by
the
state
in
this
case,
namely,
its
reliance
on
garman
and
deeply
rooted
in
state
interest
exception
to
garman
as
a
reason
for
doubting
the
continuing
force
of
hill
is
mistaken,
and
is
wrong
in
theory.
i
would
note
just
to
complete
this
point
that
the
distinction
i
have
stated
between
these
two
different
preemption
doctrines
is
articulated
in
the
court's
opinions,
most
notably
in
the
railway
trainmen
opinion
for
the
court
by
justice
harlan,
and
is
a
basic
element
of
a
very
recent
decision
last
term
in
bellknap
versus
hale,
where
the
court
applied
a
balancing
test
only
with
regard
to
the
garman
preemption
claim
and
not
to
the
other
preemption
claim
made
in
that
case.
the
hill
case,
as
i
said,
concerned
the
florida
statute
i
have
just
described,
and
with
the
court's
permission,
because,
as
i
say,
it
is
the
bedrock
of
our
argument,
i
would
like
to
quote
portions
of
the
full
reasoning
of
the
court
which
is
set
out,
as
i
said,
on
pages
15
to
17
of
the
red
brief.
the
court
there
stated,
"the
declared
purpose
of
the
wagner
act
as
shown
in
its
first
section
is
to
encourage
collective
bargaining
and
to
protect
the
full
freedom
of
workers
in
the
selection
of
bargaining
representatives
of
their
own
choice.
"
"congress
attached
no
conditions
whatsoever
to
their
freedom
of
choice
in
this
respect.
"
"full
freedom
to
choose
an
agent
means
freedom
to
pass
upon
that
agent's
qualifications.
"
"section
4
of
the
florida
act
circumscribes
the
full
freedom
of
choice
which
congress
said
employees
should
possess.
"
"to
the
extent
that
section
4
limits
a
union's
choice
of
such
an
agent
or
bargaining
representative,
it
substitutes
florida's
judgment
for
the
workers'
judgment.
"
chief
justice
stone
concurred
in
that
portion
of
the
court's
opinion,
and
as
the
court
below
noted,
the
statute
at
issue
here
replicates
the
vice
of
the
florida
statute
exactly.
it
is
the
state
that
makes
the
determination
rather
than
the
employees
as
to
who
will
be
their
agent.
the
state
law
as
well
in
practical
terms
as
justice
o'connor
points
out
runs
afoul
of
the
second
holding
of
hill.
hill
also
held
that
even
a
proper
registration
requirement
could
not
be
enforced
by
means
which
would
constitute
an
obstacle
to
collective
bargaining.
there
is
no
need
for
surmise
here
on
the
effect
of
a
dues
remedy,
if
i
can
use
the
word
"remedy"
in
this
context,
in
this
case.
there
are
undisputed
affidavits
from
the
union
that
it
cannot
act
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
for
some
85
to
90
percent
of
its
membership
if
there
is
an
absolute
state
bar
for
those
people
paying
a
penny
to
the
union
as
dues.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
believe
that
the
principle
of
hill
does
remain
unimpaired.
the
court
distinguished
hill.
it
did
not
overrule
or
question
its
reasoning,
and
that
is
so
even
though
justice
frankfurter
wrote
the
plurality
opinion,
and
he
was
one
of
the
two
dissenters
in
hill.
it
seems
to
us
as
it
appears
to
have
struck
the
court
that
the
decisive
difference
between
the
hill
case
and
this
case
on
the
one
hand
and
deveau
on
the
other
is
that
congress
had
acted.
congress
is
not
limited
to
making
such
exceptions
to
its
general
rules
as
congress
chooses
to
make,
and
in
deveau,
new
york
and
new
jersey
had
gone
to
congress
and
asked
for
approval
of
a
compact
and
a
compact
which
justice
frankfurter
underlined
gave
congressional
authorization
to
enabling
legislation.
section
8
of
the
waterfront
act
was
part
of
the
package
of
enabling
legislation
which
was
already
in
force.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
was
and
it
was
not.
the
congress
did
not
simply
give
approval
to
the
compact,
the
substantive
terms
of
the
compact.
it
also
gave
approval...
whether
that
was
wise
or
not
is
another
question.
it
also
gave
approval
to
enabling
legislation,
and
it
did
so
after
hearings
at
which
it
was
advised
that
the
enabling
legislation
included
section
8
of
the
waterfront
act
and
where
the
waterfront
unions
had
argued
that
that
was
precisely
why
the
compact
which
provided
for
approval
of
enabling
legislation
should
not
be
approved.
and
in
those
terms,
we
do
not
believe
that
deveau,
the
ruling
in
deveau
changes
the
law
of
substantive
supersession.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
that
they
should
not
prevail.
i
think
that
the
question
is
about
as
nicely
balanced
as
one
can
imagine.
there
is
one
other
factor
which
was
heavily
relied
on
by
the
court
and
it
is
this
added
factor
which
seems
to
me
to
make
the
question
a
particularly
difficult
one,
or
one
of
the
two
reasons
i
think
it
is
a
particularly
difficult
one.
new
jersey
and
new
york
did
not
simply
come
to
congress
and
say
we
have
a
feeling
that
a
compact
is
needed.
we
would
like
to
extend
our
authority
because
there
are
certain
possibilities
that
we
can
envisage.
they
came
to
congress
and
said,
there
is
persuasive
evidence
detailed
in
hearings
held
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
held
by
congress
that
there
is
a
very,
very
substantial
problem
in
the
new
york-new
jersey
waterfront,
and
that
extreme
measures
are
necessary
to
deal
with
that
problem.
and
congress,
the
reports
show,
was
convinced
of
the
soundness
of
that
argument.
now,
i
had
no
basis
for
judging,
and
i
don't
know
how
one
would
go
about
the
process
of
whether
connecticut
could
make
a
sufficient
showing
and
what
is
a
sufficient
showing
for
congress.
i
think
that
the
situation
therefore
is
that
those
states
that
wish
authority
in
this
area
have
to
make
their
case
to
congress
just
the
way
anyone
who
wishes,
any
state
authority
that
wishes
authority
which
is
contrary
to
general
federal
principles
has
to
make
the
case
to
congress.
it
may
be
that
the
sheer
number
of
requests
will
have
one
of
two
effects.
first,
to
cause
congress
to
change
the
general
rule
rather
than
to
make
ad
hoc
exceptions.
or,
to
repent
of
its
one
exception
on
the
ground
that
it
has
proved
unwise,
and
it
is
the
proverbial
camel's
nose
under
the
tent.
that
is
for
congress.
that
is
uniquely
for
congress,
and
there
is,
we
submit,
no
showing
that
congress
has
repented
of
what
it
has
done
in
general
terms
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
indeed,
we
would
suggest
that
the
1947
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
amendment
tends
to
prove
exactly
the
opposite.
congress,
as
the
court
knows,
completely
rewrote
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1947.
in
the
legislative
deliberations,
congress
was
conscious
of
and
referred
to
hill
versus
florida,
and
to
bethlehem
steel
versus
new
york
board,
both
of
which
stand
for
the
principle
that
it
is
not
open
to
the
states
in
industries
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
regulate
any
aspect
of
the
representation
process,
that
that...
that
such
state
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
scheme,
and
congress
in
light
of
those
determinations
made
two
specific
judgments.
first,
as
a
proviso
to
section
10(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
there
is
a
special
permission
for
the
federal
labor
board
to
enter
into
agreements
with
state
labor
boards
to
administer
the
law
so
long
as
the
law
is
substantively
consistent
with
the
federal
law.
to
that
extent,
congress
recognized
and
dealt
with
the
problem
presented
to
this
court
in
the
bethlehem
steel
case.
it
did
not
do
what
new
york
had
wanted
in
the
bethlehem
steel
case,
namely
the
right
to
regulate
whether
or
not
the
state
law
was
absolutely
consistent,
but
only
on
an
undertaking
of
consistency.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
believe
that
on
the
reasoning
of
hill,
it
is
sections
7
and
9
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
section
2-5
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
prevents
the
states
from
narrowing
the
scope
of
employee
free
choice,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
that
congress
has
said
or
done
since
passing
sections
7
and
9
and
2-5
and
reconsidering
the
matter
in
47
which
changes
the
substance
of
the
federal
law.
this
is
an
area,
employee
free
choice,
where
congress
has
taken
the
matter
in
hand,
has
stated
an
overall
purpose
and
principle,
and
has
made
only
such
very
narrow
limitations--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes,
we
have
only
a
substantive
supersession
argument
here.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
correct.
it
would
not
be--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
believe
that
hill
versus
florida
is
specifically
on
that
unless
you
confine
your
question
to
a
specific
industry.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
oh,
i
apologize.
i
thought
you
meant--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
i
apologize.
we
think
that
on
the
question
of
whether
states
can
move
in
particular
industries
as
opposed
to
whether
a
state,
to
go
back
to
the
question
you
asked
before
lunch,
could
pass
an
across
the
board
statute,
that
the
principle
on
which
we
rely
is
best
stated
in
the
wisconsin
board
case
in
340--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
we
think
the
structure
of
the
act
is
that
congress
has
not
given
it
to
the
states
to
make
industry
by
industry
deviations
from
the
general
rule.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
don't
think
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
creates
any
right
to
work.
if
a
union
were
to
protest
either...
were
to
protest
a
licensing
law
that
you
can't
be
a
skilled
craftsman,
plumber,
or
electrician...
there
are
such
laws...
unless
you
meet
certain
requirements
to
be
an
employee,
we
simply
don't
believe
that
the
act
speaks
to
that.
the
act
takes
the
group
of
employees
as
they
are.
the
only
thing
that
hill
says
is
that
once
you
have
that
group,
they
make
the
judgment
of
who
among
their
number
may
be
a
state
office.
so
we
simply
don't
think
that
congress
has
regulated
that
far,
just
as
we
have
no
brief
to
carry
for
the
employers
who
are
regulated
by
the
new
jersey
law.
there
is
simply
no
inconsistent
federal
law
which
protects
their
interests,
and
therefore
putting
due
process
and
other
such
interests
aside,
new
jersey
can
do
what
it
sees
fit.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
true.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
true.
but
in
terms
of
the
industry
specific
question,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
issue
here
is
akin
to
and
is
answered
in
principle
by
the
arguments
made
by
the
public
utilities
and
the
states
that
wish
to
regulate
public
utilities
in
the
wisconsin
board
case.
the
argument
there
was
that
while
congress
had
regulated
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
and
the
right
to
strike,
it
had
regulated
those
activities
in
a
fashion
which
showed
that
they
are
not
absolute
rights,
because
congress
had
placed
limits
on
the
rights,
and
therefore
the
states
could
in
industries
that
were
"local"
and
of
particular
importance
to
the
state,
and
that
had
historically
been
regulated
by
the
state,
impose
additional
requirements
not
permitted
by
federal
law
and
not
enacted
by
congress.
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument,
recognizing
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
general
in
terms,
and
states
general
principles,
and
that
in
the
act
congress
made
a
conscious
determination
to
regulate
to
the
full
extent
of
its
commerce
power,
and
congress
has
in
fact
made
certain
industry
specific
exemptions
and
exceptions
to
its
rules.
section
8(e)
and
section
8(f)
deal
in
specific
terms
with
the
construction
and
garment
and
apparel
industry.
section
8(g)
deals
specifically
with
the
hospital
industry.
there
are
specific
provisions
which
deal
with
industries
that
are
national
in
scope,
the
so-called
emergency
strike
provisions.
and
congress
can
and
has
and
may
make
such
exceptions
to
its
general
rules
as
it
wishes,
but
where
you
have
a
general
principle,
as
we
do
have,
and
as
hill
states,
either
for
employee
free
choice
or
for
collective
bargaining
for
the
states
to
add
or
subtract
to
the
federal
rules
in
this
area
seems
to
us
to
be
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
most
elementary
preemption
principles.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
think
that
it
may
be
consistent
with
it
in
the
way
that
chief
justice
stone
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hill.
chief
justice
stone
said
there
are
no
immunities
in
this
statute
from
state
penal
law.
if
that
is
the
limit
of
justice
frankfurter's
cryptic
statement,
i
think
that
there
is
no
inconsistency.
certainly
it
is
such
a
muted
call
for
hill's
limitation
or
rejection
that
we
would
hope
it
would
not
be
read
as
such.
i
think
if
i
can
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
section
504
of
the
lmrda,
the
provision
in
which
congress
stated
certain
limits
on
the
right
to
run
for
and
hold
union
office,
and
i
wish
to
make
only
two
points
about
that
section.
first
of
all,
as
i
have
just
noted,
congress
has
limited
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
and
the
right
to
strike.
the
court
has
recognized,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
be
indisputable,
that
congress's
limitations
do
not
mean
that
the
states
can
move
into
the
field
and
either
add
or
subtract,
and
in
that
regard,
i
do
wish
to
stress
in
particularity
the
difference
between
section...
a
critical
difference
between
both
section
504
and
section
8
of
the
waterfront
act
at
issue
in
deveau.
both
those
sections
were
limited
to
individuals
who
had
been
convicted
of
felonies.
while
the
court
did
not
use
the
term,
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
added
penalty.
the
new
jersey
statute
sweeps
well,
well
beyond
any
such
limitation.
this
statute
is
triggered
by
an
administrative
determination
that
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
that
somebody
who
has
never
committed
a
wrong
is
associating
with
other
people
who
may
or
may
not
have
committed
a
wrong
but
do
not
have
to
have
been
shown
to
have
committed
a
wrong.
moreover,
there
is
a
disqualification
for
"failure
to
cooperative
with
the
commission.
"
and
to
supply
information
not
merely
relevant
to
the
act
under
the
language
of
the
new
jersey
statute,
but
information
requested
by
the
commission.
i
think
we
are
exactly
back
into
the
area
covered
by
hill.
it
is
this
commission
created
by
new
jersey
which
is
going
to
make
a
highly
subjective,
unfocused
judgment
which
will
override
the
judgment
of
the
employees,
unless,
as
the
court
below
held
and
as
we
believe
is
compelled
by
both
the
statute
and
precedent,
the
new
jersey
law
is
declared
preempted.
