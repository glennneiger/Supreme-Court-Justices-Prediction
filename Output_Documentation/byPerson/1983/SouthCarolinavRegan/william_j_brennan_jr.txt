justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
action,
the
state
of
south
carolina
invokes
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
by
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
original
suit
against
the
secretary
of
treasury
of
the
united
states.
before
in
1982,
the
interest
earned
on
the
obligations
of
any
state
was
exempted
from
federal
income
taxes.
in
1982,
congress
enacted
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act
and
provided
that
only
obligations
in
registered
form
would
qualify
for
that
exemption.
indeed
the
amendment
expressly
provides
that
the
interest
on
obligations
issued
by
a
state
in
bearer
form
are
taxable
--
is
taxable.
in
south
carolina,
asks
leave
to
file
a
complaint
seeking
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
secretary
on
the
ground
that
this
1982
provision
violates
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity.
the
secretary
opposes
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
enact
--
that
such
an
action
is
barred
by
the
federal
anti-injunction
act.
that
act
provides
that
no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court
by
any
person
whether
or
not
such
person
is
the
person
against
whom
such
tax
was
assessed.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
find
no
merit
in
the
secretaryâ€™s
argument
and
grant
the
motion
of
south
carolina
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint.

judgment
