mr.
huger
sinkler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court:
south
carolina
this
morning
responds
to
the
leave
granted
by
this
court
to
argue
that
this
court
take
original
jurisdiction
to
dispose
of
the
case
which
it
seeks
to
bring
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
since
its
inception,
south
carolina
has
been
joined
by
perhaps
some
27
states,
and
for
that
reason,
we
move
before
this
court...
the
court
granted
permission
to
divide
argument
and
i,
thus,
will
yield
ten
minutes
of
my
argument
to
the
assistant
attorney
general
from
texas.
she
will
stress
the
financial
burdens
that
result
to
the
states
on
account
of
this
provision
in
the
law.
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
in
his
brief...
i
think
it
was
in
a
footnote...
that
since
this
case
so
clearly
lacks
merit
that
the
court
dismiss
and
grant
him
the
relief.
i
think
that
necessitates
comment
on
the
true
issues
that
are
involved
here.
this
case
really
has
a
historic
background.
in
1894,
congress
inacted
an
income
tax
law
which
was
broad
and
widesweeping.
it
included
a
provision
taxing
the
interest
on
notes
and
bonds
of
whatever
nature,
except
those
bonds
of
the
united
states
which,
by
the
terms
of
their
issuance,
were
exempt
from
taxation.
that
produced
the
famous
litigation
of
pollock
against
farmers'
loan
and
trust
company
which
was
twice
heard
by
this
court.
at
all
times,
it
was
unanimous
that
the
very
nature
of
the
federal
system
prevented
the
imposition
of
the
tax
on
the
interest
on
state
bonds.
however,
because
of
its
holding
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
power
to
impose
an
excise
tax
on
interest
and
dividends
and
rents,
the
law
was
declared...
which
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
five
to
four
in
pollock,
really
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
the
16th
amendment.
now,
from
the
time
of
pollock
until
1982,
with
the
enactment
of
tefra,
congress
had
conceded,
although
it
was
done
originally
by
mr.
cordell
hull
as
chairman
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
in
1913,
the
fact
that
interest
on
state
bonds
was
immune
from
taxation,
but
in
tefra
we
see
a
direct
challenge.
and,
meanwhile
the
court,
while
never
having
precisely
this
question
before
it,
repeatedly
said
time
after
time
that
the
doctrine
of
reciprocal
immunity,
which
was
essential
to
the
federal
system,
resulted
in
the
freedom
from
taxation
of
interest
on
state
bonds.
that
lasted
until
1982
when
tefra
challenges
both
the
meaning
of
the
16th
amendment,
as
has
been
announced
by
this
court,
although
technically,
i
suppose,
those
pronouncements
are
dicta.
they
were
pronounced
so
many
times
they
seemed
to
work
themselves
into
the
body
and
tradition
of
the
law.
and,
they
have
further
challenged...
must
further
argue
that
the
16th
amendment
permits
this
tax.
we
don't
think
it
does.
the
solicitor
general
has
urged
that
this
court
should
not
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case
despite
the
fact
that
the
second
clause
of
the
second
section
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution
specifically
grants
to
this
court
original
jurisdiction
in
actions
which
involve
a
state
and
a
citizen
of
another
state.
what
we
are
doing
here,
of
course,
is
to
seek
an
injunction
against
the
secretary
of
the
treasurer
in
the
traditional
fashion
of
enjoining
an
officer
of
the
united
states
for
performing...
acting
under
an
unconstitutional
statute,
and,
thus,
performing
an
illegal
act.
i
think
marbury
against
madison
got
into
this
court
in
the
same
way.
mr.
huger
sinkler
surely.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
think
that
is
an
invasion
of
the
state's
right.
i
think
maybe
in
that
case
you
might
get
yourself...
your
determination
might
rest
on
a
balancing
of
equities
as
has
been
traditional
where
the
commerce
clause
is
involved.
whereas
here,
where
the
taxation
clause
power
is
involved,
what
you
really
have
here
is
a
question
of
reciprocal
immunity,
one
that
really
goes
to
the
very
nature
of
the
federal
system.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
we
meet
both
burdens,
sir.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
we
can
meet
both
burdens
and
show
you.
for
instance,
south
carolina
sold
$65
million
of
bonds
on
september
13
which
we
will
deliver
in
new
york
next
week.
we
normally
pay
for
paying
agent
services
on
an
issue
of
$65
million...
i
think
we
have
had
some
before
and
we
figure
it
to
be
about
$85,000.
the
cost
of
paying
registered...
of
issuing
registered
bonds.
now,
they
are
not
so
terribly
expensive.
the
cost
of
arranging
for
their
transfers
and
arranging
for
checks
to
go
out,
we
have
an
estimate
from
the
morgan
bank,
which
is
our
fiscal
agent
and
bond
registrar,
that
the
cost
of
this
issue,
which
has
an
average
life
to
11
years
and
extends
to
00,
will
be
$385,000.
south
carolina...
which
is
an
additional
cost
of,
oh,
i
think
it
is
$310,000.
it
happens
that
south
carolina
has
approximately
a
debt
of
about
$600
million
and
the
state
treasurer
has
structured
that
debt
on
a
short-term
basis
so
he
will
able
to
come
back
to
the
trough
more
frequently.
well,
if
you
just...
assuming
it
was
$650
million,
you
really
have
added
costs
in
the
neighborhood
of
over
$3
million.
that
is
a
good
deal
of
money.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
what
you
really
do...
i
don't
think
the
federal
government,
if
we
are
going
to
have
the
traditional
federal
system,
which
is
espoused
really
as
far
back
as
weston
against
the
city
of
charleston,
in
which
they
said
at
that
time
that
the
doctrine
of
immunities
springs
from
the
very
union
of
the
states
and
the
national
government.
i
realize
you
can
also
justify
that
under
the
supremacy
act
which,
i
think,
several
members
of
this
court
have
made
that
statement.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
but
certainly
as
far
as
the
reciprocal
immunity
which
is
granted
to
the
states
that
results
from
the
nature
of
the
compact.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
that
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case,
of
course,
went
through
the
south
carolina
constitutional
court
and
by
a
four
to
three
decision
the
majority
said
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
says
we
can't
do
this.
the
dissenting
judges
said
the
very
nature
of
the
system
makes
it
impossible
for
the
state
to
tax
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government,
because
to
do
so...
and
i
thought
the
interest
rate
comment
was
marvelous...
even
though
congress
provide
that
the
money
be
lent
at
ten
percent,
if
the
states
can
tax
it,
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
will
be
powerless
to
borrow.
and,
that
is...
see,
the
burden
takes
place,
according
to
chief
justice
marshall,
the
very
existence
of
it
creates
a
burden
on
the
contract
which
has
a
sensible
impact
on
the
interest
of
the...
influence
on
the
contract
itself.
and,
furthermore,
when
one
government
can
control
the
provisions,
the
actions
of
another
government,
then
you
obviously
have
that
type
of
governmental
interference
which
i
personally
believe
the
federal
system
precludes.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
you
did,
but
i
think
you
have
got
good
distinction.
take,
for
instance,
the
most
famous
of
all
the
people
who
were
really
affected
by
this
case,
chief
justice
hughes,
who
in
wilcutts
against
bunn,
reaffirms
and
points
out
that
the
difference
between
the
imposing
of
tax
on
capital
gains
and
on
the
interest
on
bonds
is
that
one
transaction...
the
transaction
between
the
state
and
its
lender
has
been
finished
and
that
is
a
totally
new
transaction
which
results
in
part
from
the
acumen
of
the
person
who
bought
the
bonds.
mr.
huger
sinkler
he
quotes
weston
and
reaffirms
everything
that
i've
i
said.
of
course,
governor
hughes
started
the
great
debate
with
his
message...
as
governor
with
his
message
to
the
general
assembly
of
new
york
in
january
of
1910
and
that
produced
the
language
and
the
16th
amendment
came
into
focus.
there
was
this
great
debate
which
was
joined
in
by
senator
bora,
by
senator
elihu
root,
and
president
taft
himself,
on
the
basis
of
the
apparent
success
in
persuading
the
public,
the
16th
amendment
was
adopted.
hughes
twice
took
a
curtain
call
on
the
scene.
he
was
a
justice
in
the
case
of
brushaber
against
union
pracific,
the
first
case
following
the
adoption
of
the
16th
amendment,
which
held
that
it
merely
sought
to
accomplish
that
which
pollock
denied,
the
right
to
tax
rents,
interest,
and
income.
hughes,
of
course,
writing
willcutts
against
bunns
as
chief
justice,
reaffirms
all
of
that.
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
there
the
taxes
paid
by
the
individual
employee...
it
is
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
so
widespread
that
it
does
not
affect...
this
honorable
court
has
held
that
it
does
not
affect--
mr.
huger
sinkler
--i
think
it
probably
might
but
that
is
an
incidental
cost
that
this
court
saw
fit
to
declare--
mr.
huger
sinkler
--well,
if
you
do
that--
mr.
huger
sinkler
--let
me
suggest
to
you
some
of
the...
the
taxes
paid
by
the
state
itself,
the
fact
that
there
can
be
a
tax
makes
the
state
pay
the
tax.
now,
when
we
sold
these
bonds,
we
had
no
choice
of
taking...
of
issuing
coupon
bonds.
that
would
have
been
ridiculous.
we
couldn't
get
a
market
on
that.
we
obviously
had
to
sell
fully
registered
bonds.
i
did
provide
the
proceedings
that
if
this
litigation
resulted
the
way
i
hope
it
would,
we
might
later
issue
coupon
bonds,
but
from
a
practical
standpoint,
we
issued
bonds.
i
think
the
difference
in
cost
to
the
state
of
south
carolina
on
a
$65
million
issue...
we
paid
8.1.
i
think
it
would
run
to
perhaps
11.
i
am
comparing
south
carolina's
aaa
credit...
ibm
is
aaa
credit.
ibm
is
obviously
more--
mr.
huger
sinkler
--yes,
we
pay
it.
we
obviously
pay.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
the
market
would
demand
otherwise.
people
don't
buy
such
state
bonds.
they
are
looking
for
the
net
interest
cost.
that
is
all
very
carefully
calculated.
now,
this
tefra
also
put
in
a
provision
which
limited
the
deduction
that
banks
might
take
for
borrowed
money,
and
i
suppose
all
bank
money
is
borrowed
money.
when
they
came
to
calculate
their
income
tax,
it
included
15
%
of
the
tax-exempt
interest.
now,
that
is
not
challenged,
because
i
think
the
court
could
levy
a
tax
without...
the
congress
could
levy
a
tax
without
any
exemptions.
i
think
that
is
a
totally
different
situation.
but,
immediately
after
that
15
%
went
into
effect,
rates
were
adjusted
by
major
banks
so
that
they
ended
up
by
the
issue
of
paying
that
additional
tax.
it
is
inevitable.
there
is
no
possible
way
that
the
issue
can
escape
the
tax.
but,
i
think
even
worse,
the
consequences
of
this
is
the
consequences
of
congress
taking
over
the
local
affairs
of
government.
mr.
huger
sinkler
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
the
consequences
of
permitting
the
national
government
to
inject
itself
into
the
issuance
of
state
bonds.
i
am
talking
about
state
bonds
issued
for
state
purposes.
i
am
not
talking
about
industrial
revenue
or
those
type
of
bonds.
if
the
congress
can
tell
south
carolina
it
has
got
to
issue
revenue
bonds,
then
it
can
tell
south
carolina
that
it
can
only
issue
bonds
of
a
certain
kind
or
if
it
issues
those
bonds,
it
must
issue
a
different
kind
of
bond.
you
are
really
going
to
move
the
seat
of
government
from
the
local
capitals
to
washington,
because
if
you
just
look
at
the
internal
revenue
act,
section
103
was
about
two
lines
until
they
started
this
sort
of
esoteric
type
of
borrowing.
you
now
find
15
pages
and
hundreds
of
pages
of
regulations.
that
is
what
you
are
going
to
have
if
you
once
let
the
camel
put
his
nose
under
the
tent
and
tell
states
when
they
should
or
should
not
issue
bonds
or
how
they
should
issue
bonds.
i
am
talking
about
state
bonds
for
state
public
purposes,
your
honors.
mr.
huger
sinkler
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
huger
sinkler
well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
case
involves
something
a
great
deal
more
than
a
tax.
this
is
referred
to
in
the
joint
committee
reports
as
a
sanction,
not
a
tax,
this
provision.
but,
this
is
a
matter
where
this
court
should
take
jurisdiction,
because
this
case
really
involves
the
right
of
the
national
government
to
impose
its
will
upon
the
governments
of
the
states.
it
is
a
fundamental
question.
also,
he
has
boldly
announced...
i
didn't
think
he
was
going
to
boldly
announced,
i
thought
he
would
try
to
get
away
from
it...
that
the
16th
amendment
prevents
federal
government
to
tax
state
bonds
which
overrules
certainly
the
dicta
of
this
court
for
60
years.
now,
mr.
sinkler,
if
we
do
grant
your
motion
for
leave
to
file,
should
we
appoint
a
special
master?
not
at
all,
sir.
the
facts
are
here,
the
facts
are
here.
the
basic
question
is
intrusion.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
you
ought
to
let
us
file
our
motion.
mr.
huger
sinkler
and
fight
for
the
briefs
and
further
argument
i
would
assume.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
think
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
arguments.
i
think
this
court
would
find
itself
interested
in
the
history
of
the
whole
problem,
because
case
really
goes--
mr.
huger
sinkler
--i
would
have
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
huger
sinkler
we
certainly
would
have
no
objection
to
it,
your
honor.
there
happens
to
be
about
a
half
trillion
dollars
of
coupon
bonds
outstanding
now
that
are
not
covered
by
this
thing.
mr.
huger
sinkler
so
that
the
result
the
government
seeks
is
not
going
to
come
about
probably
for
a
great
many
years.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
was
denied
that,
your
honor.
mr.
huger
sinkler
i
was
denied
that.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
appealing.
mr.
huger
sinkler
that
is
right,
sir.
