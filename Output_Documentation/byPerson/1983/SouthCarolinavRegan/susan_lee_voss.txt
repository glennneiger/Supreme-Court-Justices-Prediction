ms.
susan
lee
voss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
an
immeasurable
and
heavy
financial
burden
has
been
put
on
the
key
sovereign
operations
of
the
states
by
the
enactment
of
this
particular
section
of
tefra
against
a
dubious
benefit
to
treasury,
enforcing
the
prevention
of
tax
evasion.
moreover,
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
in
his
brief
that
tax
exemption
of
municipal
bonds
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
is
a
debatable
proposition.
my
portion
of
this
argument
will
try
to
show
the
financial
consequences
of
the
effects
of
those
two
propositions
and
why
this
appeal
to
the
court's
original
jurisdiction
is
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
states.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
this
particular
financial
burden
goes
to
the
basic
premise
in
the
constitution
of
federalism,
something
which
has
been
guaranteed
to
the
states
since
constitution
law
started.
you
can
trace
it
back
to
mccullough
versus
maryland
if
you
wanted
to.
but,
each
day
this
law
is
in
effect...
in
texas
alone,
you
have
at
least
one
issuer
going
to
market,
paying
somewhere
between
$5,000
and
$14,000
in
registrar
fees
that
they
didn't
have
to
pay
before
a
year.
now,
you
are
talking
of
each
one
of
3,395
texas
issuers
goes
to
market
one
time,
about
$17
million
annually
in
additional
registrar
costs.
these
are
costs
that
these
issuers
did
not
have
to
bear
before.
there
are
about
47,000
municipal
issuers
in
this
country.
and,
those
registrar
costs
hit
the
little
issuers
a
lot
harder
than
they
hit
the
big
issuers.
one
of
the
big
guys
like
the
university
of
texas
that
doesn't
really
usually
go
to
market
for
less
than
$20
million
at
a
time
is
going
to
pay
lower
registrar
fees
than
some
little
school
district
that
can
barely
issue
on
its
tax
base
maybe
$1
million
to
renovate
a
60-year
old
schoolhouse.
and
those
figures
only
represent
the
registrar
fees.
additional
attorney's
fee
are
extra,
additional
costs
of
documentation
are
extra.
registrar
fees
do
not
even
include
the
postage
for
mailing
out
the
interest
checks.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
susan
lee
voss
well,
that
is
permanent
university
fund
money.
but,
we
are
not
just
talking
about
a
financial
burden
alone.
it
is
a
financial
burden
that
is
going
to
help
cripple
the
ability
of
issuers
to
perform
their
governmental
functions.
you
are
talking
about
a
jail.
as
many
of
you
probably
know,
texas
probably
has
five
inmates
to
a
cell
that
was
meant
to
hold
two
and
is
under
federal
court
order
to
improve
conditions.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
yes.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
as
as
a
matter
of
marketing
bonds,
state
issuers
presently
comply
with
those
sorts
of
requirements.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
that
particular
issue
has
never
been
challenged
as
to
its
constitutionality.
the
states
have
been
complying
with
it
as
a
marketing
matter
and
i
have
serious
questions
as
to
its
constitutionality.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
yes,
sir.
when
you
have
something
like
the
jail
renovations
which
are
required
to
be
done
and
there
is
no
money
to
do
them
because
you
had
to
replace
a
school
that
burned
down
and
you
had
increased
cost
of
issuance
on
those
bonds...
probably
the
school
burned
down
because
you
knew
you
needed
the
fire
house
over
there,
but
you
didn't
have
money
for
that,
because
you
had
more
cost
of
issuance
on
the
sewage
treatment
plant.
you
are
talking
about
serious
problems
with
that.
and,
as
to
the
removal
of
the
income
tax
exemption
altogether,
you
are
going
to
foreclose
many
issuers
from
the
market
place
completely.
the
only
attraction
that
their
paper
has
in
the
market
place
right
now
is
that
tax-exempt
feature.
ms.
susan
lee
voss
no,
that
is
not
before
you,
sir.
south
carolina
has
made
an
appropriate
call
as
the
real
party
in
interest
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
as
constitutionally
provided
and
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
an
act
of
congress
could
deprive
the
state
of
that
forum,
particularly
with
the
financial
burden
to
our
governmental
functions
that
this
law
has
created.
i
submit
that
this
is
as
appropriate
case
for
this
court's
original
jurisdiction.
