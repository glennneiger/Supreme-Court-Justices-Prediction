mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
say
straight
away,
lest
the
contrary
impression
has
been
given
by
our
concentration
on
jurisdictional
obstacles
to
this
court
entertaining
the
case,
that
we
are
not
in
the
least
shy
in
reaching
the
merits.
if
the
court
concludes,
contrary
to
our
submission,
that
the
anti-injunction
act
is
not
a
barrier,
we
are
not
reluctant
to
meet
south
carolina's
constitutional
challenge.
and,
while
this
court
is
not
required
to
hear
the
case,
the
secretary
is
content
that
the
merits
be
decided
here.
indeed,
we
submit,
as
has
been
said,
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
is
sufficiently
clear
that
the
court
could
properly
dispose
of
the
case
at
this
stage
on
this
motion
for
leave
to
file.
after
all,
what
is...
and,
all
that
is
involved
here
is
an
indirect...
is
only
indirect
requirement
that
all
obligations
which
extend
for
more
than
a
year,
no
matter
by
whom
issued,
whether
by
the
united
states,
by
corporations,
by
states
and
municipalities,
if
issued
to
the
general
public,
shall
be
in
registered
form.
now,
this
is
in
no
sense
discriminatory.
it
is
only
the
mildest
intrusion
on
states'
sovereignty.
it
seems
to
us
far
less
so
than
the
requirements
sustained,
for
instance,
for
withholding
income
tax
from
state
employees.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
congress
determined,
on
the
basis
of
elaborate
hearings
and
evidence
before
it,
that
there
are
bonds
where
one
common
means,
device,
for
avoiding
gift
tax,
estate
tax,
capital
gains
tax
on
the
exchange
of
those
bonds,
that
is
was
moreover
a
haven
for
illegally
obtained
monies
and
finally
its
right
to
add
that
theft
and
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
securities
is
facilitated
when
bonds
are
in
bearer
rather
than
registered
form.
those
considerations,
all
of
which
bear
on
plain
powers
of
congress
inferred
by
article
i,
fully
justify
the
federal
interest
in
enacting
this
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
quite
candidly,
justice
blackmun,
this
is
not
a
revenue
agency
measure.
it
has
a
revenue
aspect.
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
in
that
it
is
necessary
and
proper
means
to
attempt
to
diminish
tax
evasion
and
tax
avoidance.
in
that
sense,
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
taxing
power.
but,
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
raise
additional
taxes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
tension
between
those
two
contradictory
actions
of
the
congress,
but
we
are
here
defending
that
portion
of
the
legislation
which
did
pass
and
which,
to
some
degree
at
least,
avoids
what
is
otherwise
determined
to
be
a
common
way
of
avoiding,
as
i
say,
both
gift
and
estate
taxes
and
also
capital
gains
taxes.
now,
the
burden
imposed
on
the
states
as
a
result
of
this
is
surely
less
than
the
burden
imposed
by
many
other
federal
regulations,
including
the
one
i
have
just
mentioned,
the
requirement
of
withholding.
and,
as
to
the
costs,
the
additional
costs
imposed
on
the
states,
we
have
not
attempted
to
produce
counter
affidavits,
but
it
is
fair
to
surmise
that
there
would
be
offsetting
economies
in
the
area
of
insurance
and
handling,
and,
of
course,
the
statute
does
not
require
that
the
bonds,
though
issued
in
registered
form,
be
issued
through
certificates.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
quite
so,
justice
rehnquist,
though
i
take
justice
o'connor's
point
that
the
exact
degree
of
the
burden
is
not
constitutionally
relevant
so
long
as
there
is
a
plain
exercise
of
the
power
congress
under
article
i
and
even,
accepting
the
allegations
of
the
plaintiff
states,
no
impermissible
burden
imposed
on
the
power
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
or
any
other
to
raise
revenues.
this
is
simply
a
question
of
what
form
of
revenue
shall
be
raised.
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
tax
the
interest
on
all
state
and
municipal
bonds.
and,
of
course,
it
is
in
no
sense
a
prohibition
or
inhibition
on
the
states'
power
to
raise
monies.
we
would
answer
justice
stevens'
question,
whether
if
this
statute
were
not
in
the
form
of
a
tax,
but
was
simply
a
uniform
requirement
imposed
on
all
issuers
of
all
obligations
of
a
certain
character,
that
they
be
in
registered
form.
we
would
defend
that
statute
in
the
same
way
that
we
do
this
one.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
say
not
and
we
would
say
not
for
the
reasons
i
have
suggested
in
invoking
justice
o'connor's
comment.
it
may
be
that
the
court
will
feel
that
the
degree
of
the
burden,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
is
a
matter
which...
and
the
question
of
whether
there
are,
indeed,
offsetting
economies,
is
one
that
appropriately
requires
the
hearing
of
evidence,
in
which
event
a
master--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--as
i
see
it,
justice
brennan.
that
is
the
only
potential
question
that
a
master
might
be
able
to
take
evidence
and
help
this
court
toward
its--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
powell,
we
would
say
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
so
allege.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
if
contrary
to
our
position,
the
united
states
cannot
deny
exemption
to
state
and
municipal
obligations
altogether,
then
there
must
be
a
limit.
we
would
say
that
this
doesn't
approach
that
limit
since
it
doesn't
deny
the
exemption
to
all
registered
bonds
and
merely
requires
that
in
order
to
earn
the
exemptions
the
bonds
be
issued
in
that
in
that
form.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
is
a
traditional
form.
it
is
not
an
exceptional
requirement.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
powell,
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
that
question.
i
would
suppose
that
the
power
to
tax
when
abused
amounts
to
destroying
the
states'...
how
to
raise
revenue,
but
this
court
has
said
we
sit
here
to
assure
that
that
limit
is
not
reached.
what
that
limit
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
power
to
tax
may
be
limited,
but
it
is
not
eliminated
by
the
10th
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
a
tax
on
the
bond
interest.
i
am
assuming,
for
the
purpose
of
answering
justice
powell,
that
the
state's
immunity
does
run
to
the
bond
holder,
otherwise,
there
is
no
question
of
a
limitation.
now,
we
have
invoked
jurisdictional
barriers
to
this
court's
entertaining
the
case
and
we
have
done
so
because
we
deemed
it
our
duty
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
seemed
to
us
plain
obstacles
to
reaching
the
merits
in
this
case.
it
is
principle
that
no
court
should
decide
that
which
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
decide
or
that
it
ought
not
be
decided
prematurely
is
a
principle
of
more
importance
than
the
result
in
any
given
case.
it
is
important
for
the
maintenance
of
the
court
system.
and,
in
this
instance,
it
is
important
for
the
government's
interest.
it
is
familiar
that
few
things
are
more
salutary
to
our
tax
system
than
the
rule
embodied
in
statute
for
over
a
hundred
years
that
no
suit
will
lie
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
taxes.
and,
indeed,
most
states...
i
don't
know
whether
it
be
true
or
not
with
respect
to
south
carolina
and
texas,
but
it
is
the
general
rule
in
most
states
that
they
have
a
light
rule
with
the
respect
to
enjoining
of
the
collection
of
their
own
taxes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we,
justice
o'connor,
do
not
view
it
as
a
contradiction
with
the
dictum
in
marbury
versus
madison
because
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
simply
a
procedural
limitation
on
when
this
court,
as
any
other
court,
may
entertain
an
action
of
this
kind.
it
is
common
ground,
i
take
it,
that
a
statute
of
limitations
governs
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
original
jurisdiction
as
it
governs
every
other
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
say,
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that
at
least
so
long
as
the
rule
is
uniform
and
non-discriminatory
against
the
court
and
it
is
simply
a
rule
of
procedure
which
announces
when
an
injunction
is
appropriate.
for
instance--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--not
what
cases
could
be
taken
in
terms
of
classes
of
cases.
my
impression
is
that
congress
does
set
the
tone
of
this
court
by
statute.
but,
i
assume
there
are
limits
there.
i
don't
suppose
the
congress
could
say
this
court
shall
not
sit
for
two
years.
i
assume,
on
the
other
hand,
that
it
is
permissible,
as
is
present
law,
that
the
congress
may
say
that
the
court
shall
begin
its
new
term
on
the
first
monday
in
october.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
not
we
who
are
preventing
south
carolina
from
testing
the
issue
by
issuing
their
bonds,
albeit
it
may
be
that
those
bonds
may
have
to
be
issued
in
order
to
find
purchasers
at
an
abnormally
high
rate
of
interest.
but,
if
they
wish
to
press
the
matter,
that
is
obviously
an
available
way
in
which
it
can
be
done.
it
need
not
be
a
large
issue.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
but,
there
is
no
bar
to
the
purchaser
either
challenging
the
deficiency
in
the
tax
court
if
he
has
failed
to
pay
his
interest
on
that
issue
of
the
bonds
he
holds
or
by
refund
suit
in
the
district
court
or
the
claims
court.
but,
whether
or
not
there
will,
at
the
end
of
the
day's
practical
matter,
be
an
occasion
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
is
no
reason
why
no
other
court
can
presently
entertain
this
suit.
this
court
ought
to
be
driven
to
take
jurisdiction;
that
is,
it
seems
to
us,
entirely
backwards.
congress
has,
in
the
interest
of
sparing
this
court's
burdened
docket,
given
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
a
case
of
this
kind
to
the
district
courts
and
what
south
carolina
would
suggest
is
that
because
the
anti-injunction
statute
bars
the
district
court
from
entertaining
the
suit,
it
out
to
be
bounced
back
to
this
court,
the
court
of
all
courts,
which
ought
to
be
less
hospitable
to
litigation
than
the
district
courts
whose
primary
role
is
to
entertain
original
cases.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
i
argue
both.
i
say
that
the
legislative
bar
imposed
by
the
anti-injunction
act,
just
like
the
legislative
bar
imposed
by
statute
of
limitations,
just
like
the
legislative
bar
imposed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
which,
in
turn,
supplied
to
all
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
which
this
is
one,
does
apply
here,
and,
hence,
if
it
prevents
the
district
court
from
hearing
the
case,
likewise
prevents
this
court
from
doing
so.
this
court,
however,
may
choose
not
to
determine
that
issue
and
may,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
discretion
with
an
eye
to
the
congressional
policy,
determine
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
do
the
business
which
other
courts
have
been
prevented
from
doing
in
obedience
to
a
legislative
policy
of
such
longstanding
and
with
such
obvious
salutary
reasons
behind
it.
and,
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
if
not
as
a
matter
of
necessity,
this
court
ought
to
decline
to
entertain
the
action.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
stevens,
i
am
aware
of
that
case
and
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
present
case.
i
take
it,
however,
that
the
way
in
which
it
was
dealt
with
by
this
court's
opinion
in
the
bob
jones
case
indicates
that
in
the
court's
view
it
is
no
longer
good
law
any
more
than
the
case
on
which
it
was
based,
the
beechnut
case
which
had,
in
the
court's
terms,
eroded,
if
not
scuttled,
the
anti-injunction
act.
in
allen,
which
was
a
five
to
three
decision
on
this
point,
the
court
felt
constrained
to
allow,
not
as
an
original
suit,
to
concede
that
the
anti-injunction
action
there
did
not
bar
a
suit
to
challenge
the
requirement
that
the
university
collect
amusement
tax
on
tickets
sold
at
football
games.
and,
that
may
be
very
comparable
to
this
case.
but,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
that
was
a
circumvention
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
and,
more
importantly,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
has
so
treated
in
its
now
current
opinion
in
bob
jones
university
versus
simon,
and,
indeed,
in
the
companion
case.
the
argument
the
other
way
was
put
as
eloquently
as
could
be
in
the
americans
united
case
by
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
blackmun
and...
but,
that
view
did
not
prevail
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
view
is
precisely
the
view
of
what
had
been
embraced
by
the
court
in
the
allen
case.
let
me
say
one
final
thing
with
respect
to
the
question
of
marbury
versus
madison
and
our
argument
seeming
in
contradiction
with
it.
marbury
versus
madison,
of
course,
holds
that
the
congress
cannot
add
to
the
court's
original
jurisdiction,
and,
indeed,
an
argument
could
be
made
that,
therefore,
invoking
the
declaratory
judgment
act
here
would
be
adding
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
some
sense.
we
would
not
make
that
argument.
and,
in
the
same
vein,
we
would
not
hear
say
that
the
anti-injunction
action,
statute,
takes
away
from
the
court's
jurisdiction.
it
simply
instructs
all
courts
of
the
united
states
when
they
may
hear
a
controversy,
not
what
controversies
they
may
hear.
and,
it
cannot
be
different,
whether
the
rule
is
that
it
is
too
late
to
hear
it,
as
in
the
case
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
too
soon
to
hear
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
could
be
no
such
case
in
which
south
carolina
was
plaintiff,
but
that
is
often
true.
the
reason
south
carolina--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
with
respect
to
this
particular
issue,
i
think
that
is
so.
south
carolina,
of
course,
need
not
sit
and
tarry
on
the
sidelines
when
the
taxpayer
files
his
refund
suit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
he
would
just
as
soon
pocket
all
that
higher
interest
rate
rather
than
pay
half
of
it
to
the
treasury.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
may
be,
and
this
is
precisely
the
argument
that
justice
blackmun
made
in
americans
united,
that
such
a
suit
might
never
come
about
because
the
organization,
among
other
things,
might
change
its
activity
or
because
the
contributor
wouldn't
find
it
worthwhile
hiring
a
lawyer
and
going
through
the
cost
and
delays
of
filing
a
suit
to
which
the
court
said
that
is
no
reason
to
break
the
rule
of
the
anti-injunction
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
appreciate
that
the
state
has
a
claim
and
that
the
state
is
different
from
an
ordinary
party.
of
course,
with
respect
to
ordinary
taxpayers,
it
must
happen
every
day;
that
people
who
would
engage
in
a
certain
commercial
transaction,
if
they
were
assured
of
the
tax
consequences,
but
not
being
able
to
obtain
a
declaration
from
a
court
in
advance
and
not
being
able
to
obtain
a
favorable
revenue
ruling,
simply
demur
and
do
not
engage
in
that
transaction
and
the
matter
is
never
tested
judicially.
that
is
no
reason
to
allow
an
advance
declaratory
or
injunctive
action.
and,
it
seems
to
us,
the
same
reasoning
must
apply
in
this
case.
after
all,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
was
afforded
to
states
in
order
to
available
them
of
a
forum
which
was
thought
equal
to
their
sovereign
dignity.
but,
it
was
not
a
forum
that
was
meant
to
be
more
open
or
more
hospitable
than
the
other
forum
equally
available
to
the
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
impression
is
that
that
statute
was
repealed
and
is
not
presently
the
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not.
one
final
thing
on
that
score.
the
most
recent
amicus
brief
filed,
and
i
am
not
confident
whether
the
court
has
granted
leave
to
file
it,
but
suggests
that
the
alternative
to
this
statute
is
a
requirement
that
the
issuer's
paying
agent
report
to
whom
the
bearer
bonds
have
been
delivered,
keep
records
of
any
payments
of
interest
and
thereby
furnish
a
trail
for
the
federal
revenue
officers
to
satisfy
themselves
that
there
has
been
no
attempted
avoidance
or
evasion
of
tax.
i
am
frankly
baffled
about
what
is
different
about
conceding
that
those
requirements
would
be
proper
and
challenging
this
more
straightforward
requirement
that
the
bonds
be
issued
in
registered
form
as
an
issue.
we
submit
that
the
court
ought
not
grant
leave
to
file
because,
as
a
matter
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
applicable
here
as
elsewhere,
the
court
cannot
entertain
the
suit.
it
should
not--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
that
if
the
merits
are
appropriately
reached,
they
are
sufficiently
clear
that
the
suit
should
be
dismissed
at
this
stage.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
perhaps
missed
the
passage
your
honor
refers
to
in
the
allen
case.
i
had
not
appreciated
that
the
court
felt
that
because
it
was
state
rather
than
an
ordinary
taxpayer
the
anti-injunction
statute
prohibition
ought
to
be
relaxed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
case
was
wrongly
decided
as
bob
jones
indicates.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
exactly
so,
justice
rehnquist.
i
cannot
reconcile
them
and
i
don't
think
this
court
attempted
to
do
so
in
simon.
but,
the
court
clearly
repudiated
the
case
on
which
allen
is
in
turn
relying
and
mentioned
allen
as
simply
following
in
that
erroneous
view.
and,
while
the
case
is
not
in
terms
overruled,
i
take
it
its
holdings
have
been
effectively
eroded
i
submit.
