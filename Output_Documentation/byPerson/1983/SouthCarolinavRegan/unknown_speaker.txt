unknown
speaker
mr.
sinkler,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
you
have
left
the
merits
and
are
going
to
the
injunction
act.
in
your
view
would
congress
have
the
power
to
pass
a
statute
that
said
all
bonds
traded
in
the
interstate
market
must
be
in
registered
form,
including
those
issued
by
a
state,
without
any
taxation
as
a
penalty?
unknown
speaker
but,
that
would
be
a
lesser
burden
or
a
greater
burden
on
the
state
than
the
one
they
have
now
because
you
can
avoid
the
tax
by
selling--
unknown
speaker
--you
do?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
the
federal
government
may
not
impose
any
regulation
on
the
issuance
of
bonds
that
imposes
any
cost
on
the
state?
you
say
they
require
to
be
printed
in
english
and
have
certain
disclosures
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunity
kind
of
reached
a
high
point
in
the
1870's
or
1880's
and
then
some
of
this
court's
cases
in
the
30's
rather
drastically
cut
back
on
this,
especially
where
states
are
concerned.
unknown
speaker
did
that
case
involve
intergovernmental
immunities?
unknown
speaker
what
about
federal
taxation
and
the
salaries
of
state
employees?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
it
might
increase
the
state's
cost
of
its
labor
force.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
government,
instead
of
speaking
about
registered
bonds,
just
subjected
to
income
taxation
all
of
the
interest
on
all
state
bonds?
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
that
tax
would
be
paid
by
the
holders
of
the
bonds.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
south
carolina
is
paying
an
increased
interest,
the
equivalent
of
the
tax
burden
on
the
holder?
unknown
speaker
ms.
voss,
there
are
many
things
the
federal
government
does
by
way
of
congressional
or
regulatory
requirements
that
end
up
costing
states
a
lot
of
money.
so,
how
does
the
financial
burden
alone
support
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
and
the
income
from
the
oil
wells.
unknown
speaker
and
the
income
from
the
oil
wells
at
the
university
of
texas.
unknown
speaker
general
voss,
could
i
ask
you,--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
the
federal
government
were
to
have
regulations
with
the
kind
of
disclosures
a
borrower
has
to
make
when
it
issues
bonds
and
they
say
you
have
to
file
a
registration
statement
and
tell
where
you
are
financially
solvent
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
which
is
costly
to
hire
accountants
to
prepare
the
statement.
could
they
require
a
state
issuer
to
comply
with
rules
of
that
kind
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
assume...
could
the
federal
government
compel
them
to,
and,
say,
could
they
change
those
to
make
them
more
burdensome
without
violating
their--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
your
argument
would
apply
to
that
as
well.
you
are
basically
arguing
that
there
is
no
power
in
the
federal
government
to
impose
any
burden
whatsoever
upon
a
state
issuing
bonds
which
is
a
rather
extreme
position.
but,
that
is
your
position,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case,
do
we,
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
tax
the
income
from
municipal
bonds?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
government's
interest,
mr.
claiborne?
unknown
speaker
since
i
am
old
enough
to
remember
when
registered
bonds
were
rather
frequently
encountered,
they
disappeared
over
the
years.
certainly
there
can't
be
much
federal
government
interest
in
getting
to
the
tax
as
such.
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
government...
the
congress
retreat
from
the
withholding
of
interest
and
dividends
that
makes
this
argument
sound
rather
hollow,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
burden
is
a
factual
matter,
you
are
suggesting
that
we
ought
to
surmise
that
there
would
be
offsetting
benefits
really
doesn't
dispense
with
the
necessity
of
some
sort
of
an
inquiry
if
a
there
is
a
factual...
if
the
factual
question
of
burden
should
play
a
part
in
deciding
the
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
may
i
ask,
if
our
decision
is
to
grant
the
motion
for
leave
to
file,
would
it
be
necessary
to
appoint
a
special
master?
unknown
speaker
but,
that
would
be
the
only
inquiry
that
need
be
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
does
the
federal
government
have
the
authority
to
withdraw
altogether
the
tax
exemption
on
income
from
state
and
municipal
bonds?
unknown
speaker
the
government
does
have
the
authority?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but,
is
there
a
limiting
principle,
and,
if
so,
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
that
is
a
matter--
unknown
speaker
--could
the
federal
government
do
what
it
has
done
to
the
rest
of
the
public
and
that
is
start
with
a
very
low
income
tax
on
state
and
municipal
securities
and
gradually
move
it
up?
unknown
speaker
the
power
to
tax
is
not
limited
by
the
10th
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
you
don't
concede
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
state,
do
you?
it
is
a
tax
on
the
bond
holders.
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
is
your
position
about
the
power
of
congress
to
limit
the
court's
jurisdiction
somewhat
contrary
to
marbury
versus
madison?
unknown
speaker
can
the
congress
limit
the
remedies
that
this
court
can
provide
in
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction,
its
original
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
by
that
argument,
can
congress
limit
the
term
in
which
this
court
can
sit
or
establish
filing
fees
that
would
determine
what
cases
could
be
taken?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
correct
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
is
there
any
way
at
all
that
south
carolina
could
get
a
hearing
on
its
question
in
any
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
the
purchaser
himself
would
have
to
file
a
suit,
not
south
carolina.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
goes
to
the
proper
use
of
the
discretion
of
this
court,
whether
to
accept
it
or
not,
don't
you
think?
you
are
arguing
instead
that
this
court
cannot
accept
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
have
you
considered
the
case
of
allen
against
the
regents
of
the
university
of
georgia
in
connection
with
your
argument,
whether
that
isn't
a
response
that
you
ought
to
deal
with?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
how
could
the
court
ever
hear
on
appeal
a
case
to
which
south
carolina
was
a
party
in
connection
with
this
task
if
we
can't
hear
it
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
then
saying
that
south
carolina
could
never
have
an
adjudication
in
this
court
at
its
instance.
unknown
speaker
if
the
taxpayer
ever
does.
as
a
taxpayer
he
is
going
to
be
getting
higher
interest
rates,
what
has
he
got
at
stake?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
he
has
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
he
is
not
getting
any
less
out
of
his
bonds
than
he
ever
did.
only
south
carolina
is
getting
less
out
of
its
bonds.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
is
a
party
here.
that
wasn't
involved
in
the
bob
jones
case.
unknown
speaker
is
there
now
a
withholding
on
interest
on
bonds
issued
by
private
issuers?
unknown
speaker
so
that
south
carolina,
if
it...
would
be
under
no
obligation
now
to
file
any
withholding
statements
or
to
report
to
the
government
how
much
interest
it
was
paying
to
people?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne--
unknown
speaker
--finish
your
sentence.
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
i
just
wanted
to
go
back
for
a
moment
to
the
allen
case
again
and
be
sure
i
understand
your
submission,
because
as
i
glance
again
at
the
opinion,
the
court
did,
in
that
case,
rely
to
some
extent
on
the
fact
that
you...
a
state
had
interest
involved,
the
university
of
georgia,
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
georgia
was
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
state,
and
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
bob
jones
as
in
effect
repudiating
the
rationale
of
that
case,
it
really
couldn't
repudiate
that
aspect
of
the
case.
so,
maybe
it
at
least
survived
when
the
person
seeking
to
bring
the
litigation
is
the
state
as
opposed
to
a
private
university
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
fact
though
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and,
i
may
read
too
much
into
it.
it
isn't
as
clear
as
it
might
be.
i
am
not
suggesting
you
misread
it.
but,
that
is
really
your
response
to
the
case,
to
that
case
is
almost
exclusively
that
bob
jones
has
undermined
it?
unknown
speaker
the
reasoning
of
allen
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
of
bob
jones,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sinkler,
may
i
ask...
i
don't
think
you
have
suggested
a
response
to
the
government's
argument.
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
this
suit.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
have
addressed
the
government's
argument,
have
you,
that
the
tax
injunction
act
bars
this
court's
jurisdiction
of
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
agree
with
you?
what
should
we
do
at
this
juncture?
we
haven't
granted
leave
to
file
yet.
unknown
speaker
then
what?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
have
some
arguments
on
the
merits
you
haven't
presented
now?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
you
are
going
to
do
that,
why
wouldn't
you
want
the
opportunity
to
support
some
of
your
factual
obligations
about
the
burdens
on
the
state
and
maybe
the
federal
government
would
want
to--
unknown
speaker
--have
testimony
with
respect
to
what
kind
of
a
basis
there
is
for
requiring
registered
bonds.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sinkler,
you
have
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction,
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
out
of
the
case?
