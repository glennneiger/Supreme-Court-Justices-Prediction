unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
holding
of
the
miranda
opinion,
was
there
a
holding
in
miranda?
unknown
speaker
it
was
really
all
dicta,
the
whole
opinion,
wasn't
it?
because
none
of
the
facts
of
the
particular
miranda
fellow,
who
was
convicted
of
an
offense
and
everything,
didn't
raise
any
of
the
questions
that
the
court
decided.
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
quite
a
few
cases
since
then.
unknown
speaker
in
innis
the
court
seems
to
have
decided
that
unlike
williams
against
brewer
that
there
was
no
question
put
to
innis.
there
was
a
statement
made
by
one
policeman
to
another
which
was
said
to
have
stimulated
the
response
of
the
accused.
unknown
speaker
this
question
was
directed
to
the
accused,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
rappaport,
certainly
the
language
in
rhode
island
versus
innis
seemed
to
indicate
that
questions
reasonably
likely
to
elicit
incriminating
responses
were
not
allowable
in
the
absence
of
the
miranda
warnings.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
proposal
is
certainly
contrary
to
that
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
response
to
that
question.
unknown
speaker
this
question
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
offense,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
pretty
incriminating,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
question
about
a
crime,
the
sullivan
law
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
no,
this
was
specific.
where
is
the
gun
and
to
have
a
gun
is
a
violation
of
the
law
in
new
york
unless
you
have
a
permit.
so,
you
are
asking
him,
have
you
committed
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
he
had
already
frisked
him.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
rappaport,
precisely
that
question,
precisely
that
question
could
have
been
addressed
to
one
of
the
clerks
or
customers
in
the
store
if
they
were
standing
nearby,
near
enough
to
see
what
had
been
done
with
the
gun,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
response
of
the
customer
or
the
clerk
would
not
involve
a
question
about
a
crime,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rappaport,
i
guess
there
are
other
issues
that
you
raise
in
the
case.
did
you
expect
to
discuss
those
during
your
presentation?
unknown
speaker
and,
would
you
mind
mentioning
whether
you
raised
those
issues
in
the
courts
below?
unknown
speaker
in
what
court
did
you
make
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
make
any
argument
when
the
arguments
are
directed
against
you
in
the
trial
court,
do
you?
i
mean,
it
is
the
other
people
who
are
making
the
federal
challenge
and
so
forth.
your
first
chance
to
really
be
on
the
other
side
is
if
the
trial
court
rules
against
and
you
go
to
the
appellate
division.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
addressed
them
in
the
state
courts,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
precluded
from
making
those
arguments
in
the
state
appellate
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
made
the
argument
and
they
ignored
it,
they
necessarily
rejected
it.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
won
only
on
the
fruits
question?
his
initial
statement
was
introduced
too,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
with
the
gun,
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
your
argument
inconsistent,
do
you
think,
with
the
orozco
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
arguing
that
this
question
was
necessary
to
complete
the
arrest,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
the
handcuffs
had
already
been
placed
on
him
and
that
he
had
been
arrested
at
the
time
of
the
question.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
was
he
still
in
danger
after
he
was
handcuffed?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
in
the
world
could
happen
to
him
if
the
man
was
handcuffed
with
his
hands
behind
him?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't.
he
asked
him
a
question.
unknown
speaker
and,
as
the
east
indian
said,
it
is
much
easier
to
rub
red
pepper
in
his
eyes
instead
of
doing
my
work.
unknown
speaker
all
he
did
was
ask
a
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
have
coercion?
do
you
mean
a
man
that
is
handcuffed
is
not
coerced?
unknown
speaker
would
your
distinction
between
seizure
and
custody
come
in
airport
search
cases
where
perhaps
you
might
say
that
in
response
to
a
stop
and
frisked
a
person
felt
they
were
not
free
to
walk
away,
but
nonetheless
you
would
say
they
may
be
seized
but
they
weren't
there
in
custody?
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
handcuffed.
unknown
speaker
but,
they
didn't.
unknown
speaker
in
the
terry
case
he
frisked
him
for
his
own
protection.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't
need
to
frisk
this
man
for
he
has
already
frisked
him.
unknown
speaker
and,
he
found
an
open
holster.
unknown
speaker
and,
then
he
handcuffed
him.
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
couldn't
get
any
gun.
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
done
it
with
his
teeth
and
fired
with
his
teeth?
unknown
speaker
weren't
there
other
people
in
the
store
too?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
record
show
that
he
was
hoping
he
would
come
out
of
the
store
so
that
he
wouldn't
have
to
bother
the
other
people?
didn't
the
policeman
say
that?
unknown
speaker
it
said
it
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
some...
just
some
major
time
in
connection
with
the
arrest
and
no
difference
between
the
kinds
of
questions?
incident
to
arrest,
did
you
kill
her?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose.
you
don't
want
to
arrest
somebody
who
didn't
commit
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
isn't,
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
ask
him
where
is
the
body
or
did
you
kill
her?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
seem
to
be
though.
you
say
you
put
that
aside,
but
i
think
your
rationale
would
cover
any
kind
of
a
question
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
let's
have
a
bright-line
rule
for
officers.
unknown
speaker
an
officer
is
not
going
to
get
a
very
bright
line
if
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
kinds
of
questions
you
can
ask.
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
some
difficulty
distinguishing,
under
your
rationale,
between
did
you
kill
her
and
where
is
the
gun?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
officer
in
the
pat-down,
instead
of
finding
a
weapon,
found
a
couple
of
the
types
of
balloons
that
normally
are
used
to
move
marijuana
about.
could
he
have
asked
where
is
the
marijuana?
unknown
speaker
you
could
have
a
rationale
that
turned
on
danger
either
to
the
officer
or
the
public.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
facts
were...
the
question
was
is
that
your
red
volkswagon
out
in
front
of
the
store
and
then
that
is
asked
against
the
background
that
the
police
had
then
been
informed
by
the
victim,
the
complaining
person,
that
she
had
been
abducted
and
taken
somewhere
by
a
red
volkswagon.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
assuming
in
my
hypothetical
that
he
answered,
yes,
that
is
my
red
volkswagon,
which
would
certainly
rather
firmly
tie
him
to
the
criminal
act,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
officer
had...
he
saw
the
defendant
down
at
the
end
of
this
aisle
and
he
pulled
his
gun
and
said
halt
or
raise
your
hands
and
the
defendant
halted
and
raised
his
hands.
and,
the
officer,
with
his
gun
still
pointed
at
him,
says,
where
is
your
gun?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
miranda
forbids
that
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
evidence
had
been
that
two
men
had
committed
this
crime
and
they
both
ran
into
the
store
and
the
officer
sees
one
of
them,
arrests
him,
handcuffs
him,
frisks
him,
doesn't
find
the
gun,
he
finds
an
empty
holster.
unknown
speaker
well,
miranda
didn't
rest
on
coercion,
it
rested
on
the
possibility
of
coercion.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
here?
is
it
the
handcuffs?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
hadn't
been
handcuffed?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
hadn't
been
handcuffed?
unknown
speaker
in
a
public
place,
in
a
supermarket,
there
is
a
possibility
of
third
degree
tactics
that
miranda
was
aimed
at
preventing?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
in
a
public
place,
wasn't
it?
people
were
around.
unknown
speaker
police
aren't
about
to
take
out
a
piece
of
rubber
hose
and--
--where
does
it
state
that
there
was
nobody
around?
unknown
speaker
i
never
heard
of
a
supermarket
with
nobody
around.
unknown
speaker
i
have
been
in
those
too.
[laughter]
well,
certainly
there
were
people
on
the
checkout.
unknown
speaker
they
weren't
in
the
station
house
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
they
weren't
locked
up
in
somebody's
bedroom.
they
were
in
a
public
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
handcuffed,
that
is
true,
and
he
was
under
arrest.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
closest
case
you
think
for
the
beginning
of
the
miranda
obligation?
what
is
the
closest
case
of
this
court,
orozco?
unknown
speaker
that
was
another
five
to
four
decision,
wasn't
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
not
really.
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
only
two
dissenters.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hyman,
there
are
some
exceptions
that
we
recognized,
even
after
a
custodial
arrest,
booking
information,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
so,
some
types
of
questions
we
have
permitted
without
warnings.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
some
booking
questions
could
be
incriminatory
in
a
sense.
one's
identity,
i
suppose,
could
be.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
arrested
someone
on
a
charge
of
impersonating
someone
else,
the
question
of
what
is
your
real
name
might
be
designed
to
produce
an
incriminating
answer,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hyman?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
safety
element,
what
about
employees
of
the
store
who
might
be
called
on
to
move
the
carton
in
which
the
gun
had
been
dropped?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
question.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
worse
still
if
you
didn't
know
it
was
there
and
picked
up
the
carton
and
it
dropped
and
shot
him,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
court
have
to
decide
in
innis
that
there
was
no
interrogation
of
innis?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hyman,
in
this
case,
i
assume
that
if
he
had
not
been
handcuffed,
you
would
not
be
making
this
argument.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
suppose
mr.
innis
thought
there
was
a
question
pending
before
the
house?
there
were
three
of
them
in
the
automobile,
mr.
innis,
and
two
officers.
unknown
speaker
his
argument
here
was
that
the
statement
of
the
one
policeman
to
the
other,
the
question
of
one
policeman
to
the
other
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
question
to
the
accused--
unknown
speaker
--who
was
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
a
rather
shallow
difference,
isn't
it,
between
that
and
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
words
that
came
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
policeman
in
innis
were,
in
effect,
where
is
the
gun,
where
is
the
shotgun,
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know
that
is
what
we
decided,
but
i
am
trying
to
see
what
the
difference
is
between
innis
and
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--except
that
the
question
was
directed
here
to
your
client
and
ostensibly
or
superficially
the
question
in
innis
was
directed
by
one
officer
to
another
and
there
was
no
possibility
that
either
of
the
officers
knew
where
the
gun
was.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
where
miranda
has
been
applied
to
an
arrest
and
questioning
in
a
public
place?
unknown
speaker
but,
we
haven't
had
a
case
where
it
was
in
a
public
place
and
we
required
the
miranda
warnings?
no,
you...
you
have
not
specifically
held
that
as
the
rationale
of
the
case,
no.
i
suppose
one
of
your
responses
to
that
might
be
that
that
would
lead
police
officers
to
conduct
all
their
interrogation
in
public
places.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
a
good
idea.
if
they
did,
they
certainly
wouldn't...
you
know,
miranda
said
you
can
take
some
other...
instead
of
giving
the
warnings,
you
can
take
some
other
kinds
of
precautions
to
avoid
the
danger
of
third
degree
like
moving
into
a
public
place
perhaps,
having
televised
questioning.
that
isn't
the
only
way
of
avoiding
the
evils
of
miranda.
unknown
speaker
did
miranda
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
say
this
is
the
only
way
the
state
may--
unknown
speaker
--that
these
are
not
iron-clad
rules.
unknown
speaker
it
avoids
coercion.
it
might
avoid
coercion.
and,
what
happens
alone
in
a
station
house?
unknown
speaker
he
was
home
alone
in
his
bedroom,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
with
the
several
police
officers.
unknown
speaker
in
a
public
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
everyone
would
agree
with
that
general
proposition,
but
the
question
is
at
what
point
must
a
person
against
whom
a
federal
constitutional
question
is
urged.
and
here
the
suppression,
i
take
it,
was
urged
by
your
client.
must
he
make
varied
responses
other
than
saying,
no,
this
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
lower
courts
can
pass
on
them,
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
apply
at
the
trial
stage.
unknown
speaker
on
that
score,
mr.
hyman,
they
found
the
gun.
there
is
at
least
some
prospect
that
this
man's
fingerprints
were
on
the
gun,
is
it
not
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
that
is
essential
for
preserving...
you
are
saying,
in
effect,
that
the
person
against
whom
a
federal
question
is
urged
has
the
same
duty
and
at
the
very
same
early
stage
of
the
proceedings
to
respond
with
his
kind
of
federal
argument.
inevitable
discovery
isn't
the
raising
of
a
federal
question
for
the
first
time.
it
is
a
response
to
why
the
federal
question
raised
against
the
state
shouldn't
prevail.
unknown
speaker
well,
give
me
them
all.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
i
can
see
why
the
new
york
courts
might
hold
that
because
if
an
objection
is
made
on
the
ground
of
standing,
you
might
be
able
to
get
factual
evidence
in
to
show
standing.
but,
would
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
or
the
appellate
division
follow
that
same
principle
where
you
are
just
talking
about
kind
of
cross
currents
of
legal
arguments?
unknown
speaker
ought
that
to
bind
us
though?
i
mean,
where
it
isn't
a
question
of
raising
of
the
federal
question
at
the
earliest
possible
time,
but
it
is
basically
a
question
of
a
response
to
the
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
but,
there
again
you
have
a
factual
thing
like
standing
where
you
might
want
findings
of
fact
from
a
court
that
had
authority
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
really
think
it
is
a
factual
finding,
mr.
hyman?
i
think
probably
every
judge
in
the
country,
whether
he
sits
on
a
supreme
court,
intermediate,
appellate
court,
or
a
trial
court,
would
feel
that
he
could
tell
or
she
could
tell
whether
or
not
there
would
have
been
inevitable
discovery.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
there
could
have
been
a
finding
that
they
never
would
have
found
the
gun?
unknown
speaker
he
had
a
gun
and
had
an
empty
holster
and
you
don't
think
they
would
have
searched
the
store?
unknown
speaker
no,
right.
unknown
speaker
how
far
from
where
he
was
standing
did
they
find
the
gun
in
the
carton?
unknown
speaker
and,
you
think
they
wouldn't
have
found
it?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
logical
thing,
ordinary
human
experience
tell
you
that
they
would
look
in
every
place
within
reach
or
within
a
pitcher's
reach
of
where
he
stood?
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
thrown
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
reasonable
assumption?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
inevitable
you
say?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hyman?
unknown
speaker
in
new
york,
does
the
first
appellate
level
of
court
have
fact
finding
power?
unknown
speaker
might
this
fit
that
category?
not
in
your
opinion.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but,
it
wasn't
precluded
under
new
york
law
from
making
findings
in
the
interest
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
and,
i
guess
the
state
did
raise
the
inevitable
discovery
argument
at
that
level.
unknown
speaker
and,
do
you
think
that
the
theory
espoused
by
illinois
versus
gates
would
necessarily
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
michigan
versus
tucker
question
in
the
light
of
the
inevitable
discovery
allegation?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
admission
of
the
fruits,
if
you
will.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
and,
i
don't
think
we
have
ever
placed
any
magic
on
the
words
used
below
to
attack
the
basic
question.
unknown
speaker
but,
i
think
you
need
some
refinement.
i
mean,
what
you
have
got
here
is
basically
an
argument
by
your
client
that
you
cannot
admit
this
evidence
against
me,
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
state
constitution
to
do
so.
the
state's
response
is,
no,
it
does
not
do
so.
now,
there
is
a
federal
issue
joined
right
there.
now,
the
various
subcategories
of
argument
under
the
state's
response
as
to
why
it
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
i
don't
think,
should
have
the
same
requirement
of
raising
an
independent
federal
issue,
that
the
parties
bears
the
burden
of
the
first
federal
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
that
has
the
same
adequate
independent
state
ground
connotation
that
a
burden
on
the
party
raising
the
federal
issue
has.
unknown
speaker
but,
gates
didn't
get
this
fine,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
but,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
spoke
only
of
a
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
was
this
case
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
we
decided
michigan
and
long?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
were
they
to
know
we
didn't
make
that
requirement?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
have
made
it
explicit
if
it
was
already
the
law?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
we
made
it
explicit
because
a
lot
of
courts
weren't
catching
the
obvious,
very
obvious
signal.
unknown
speaker
it
is
none
of
our
business
and
you
need
not
comment
on
it,
but
one
can't
help
but
wonder
why
a
prosecutor
thought
he
needed
this
evidence.
but,
as
i
say,
that
is
not
our
business.
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
