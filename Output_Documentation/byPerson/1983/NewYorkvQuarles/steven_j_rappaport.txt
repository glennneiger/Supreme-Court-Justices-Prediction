mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
properly
suppressed
the
defendant's
statement,
the
gun
is
over
there,
as
having
been
elicited
in
violation
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights
and,
if
so,
whether
they
also
properly
suppressed
the
defendant's
subsequent
statements
admitting
ownership
of
the
gun,
and
the
gun
itself
which
was
recovered
seconds
after
the
statement.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
police
misconduct.
since
officer
kraft
acted
properly
in
the
instant
case,
however,
there
is
simply
no
purpose
to
be
served
by
exclusion
of
any
of
the
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
his
actions.
briefly,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
that
officer
kraft
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
respondent
had
committed
a
rape
and
was
in
possession
of
a
gun
in
a
supermarket.
when
the
respondent
saw
officer
kraft,
he
ran
towards
the
back
of
the
store.
kraft
pursued,
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
few
seconds,
caught
up
to
him,
handcuffed
him,
frisked
him,
found
an
empty
shoulder
holster,
and
then
asked,
where
is
the
gun?
the
defendant
indicated
a
carton
a
few
feet
away.
he
said,
there
is
the
gun.
kraft
recovered
the
gun
from
that
carton
and
then
asked
the
defendant,
is
this
your
gun?
the
defendant
said,
yes.
he
admitted
ownership
of
it.
and,
kraft
asked
where
he
bought
it
and
the
respondent
told
him
where
he
bought
it.
under
the
circumstances
then,
it
is
our
position
that
officer
kraft
acted
in
a
necessary
and
prudent
fashion
in
securing
that
gun
as
quickly
as
he
could.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
or
of
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
was
that
officer
kraft's
action
was
prescribed
by
this
court's
opinion
in
miranda
versus
arizona.
if
one
examines
the
considerations
underlying
the
miranda
opinion,
however,
it
becomes
clear
that
none
of
those
considerations
apply
in
the
case
at
bar.
specifically,
the
miranda
opinion
talked
about
a
lengthy
interrogation
in
an
incommunicado
atmosphere
with
abusive
police
practices
that
lead
to
unreliable
confessions.
well,
in
the
instant
case,
we
have
a
single
question
asked
at
a
public
place
for
the
purpose
of
protection
of
the
police
officers
and
any
members
of
the
public
who
might
be
in
the
vicinity
and
there
were
no
abusive
police
practices
because
the
officers
had
already
holstered
their
weapons
at
the
time
that
the
question
was
asked,
and
the
defendant's
statement
was
completely
reliable
and
its
reliability
was,
in
fact,
proved
seconds
later
when
the
gun
was
located
exactly
where
the
respondent
said
that
it
would
be.
of
course,
it
may
be
said
that
even
if
the
considerations
underlying
the
miranda
opinion
do
not
apply
to
the
case,
the
holding
of
the
miranda
opinion
requires
suppression
of
the
defendant's
statement
and
the
derivative
evidence.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
holding
of
the
case
was
that--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
that
is
why
i
thought
it
important
to
discuss
the
considerations
underlying
the
opinion
which
take
up
a
great
portion
of
the
body
of
the
opinion.
but,
whether
you
want
to
call
it
dicta
or
holding,
the
court
certainly
prescribed
certain
rules
for
police
officers
to
follow.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
there
have
been
many
cases
since
then,
of
course,
interpreting
that.
it
is
our
position,
of
course,
that
while
we
are
willing
to
concede
for
purposes
of
our
argument
that
defendant
was
in
custody
at
the
time
the
question
was
asked,
we
submit
he
was
not
subjected
to
interrogation.
now,
there
was
language
in
the
miranda
opinion
itself
exempting
from
the
definition
of
custodial
interrogation
general
on-the-scene
questioning
as
to
facts
surrounding
a
crime.
the
opinion
itself
left
open,
however,
whether
such
questioning
can
occur
when
an
individual
was
in
custody.
now,
this
court
did
not
return
to
the
definition
of
interrogation
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment
until
1980
in
rhode
island
versus
innis.
in
innis,
of
course,
the
court
held
that
in
addition
to
express
questioning
interrogation
also
includes
any
words
or
actions
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
other
than
those
normally
attendant
in
arrest
and
custody
which
the
police
should
know
are
pretty
likely
to
elicit
an
incriminating
response.
now,
if
that
innis
standard--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
yes,
it
was.
of
course,
it
was.
but,
i
was
about
to
say
that
if
the
innis
standard
were
to
be
applied
to
the
case
at
bar,
we
would
submit
that
the
question,
where
is
the
gun,
posed
to
an
individual
who
is
being
arrested
for
an
armed
felony,
and
when
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
there
is
a
gun
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
arrest
in
a
public
place,
it
must
be
considered
normally
attendant
to
the
arrest
and
custody
of
that
individual.
however,
as
you
point
out,
the
innis
opinion
itself
did
not
involve
an
express
question
and
we
would
submit
that
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
the
standard
set
forth
in
this
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
express
questions.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
well,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
face
of
the
innis
opinion
says
that
interrogation
is
either
express
questioning
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
questioning
and
then
went
on
to
define
the
functional
equivalent
of
express
questioning
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
reasonably
likely
to
elicit
an
incriminating
response.
again,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
innis
opinion
itself
did
not
involve
an
express
question
and
the
standard
it
was
formulating
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
express
questions.
now,
there
have
been,
however,
many
state
and
lower
federal
court
opinions
which
have
answered
the
question
which
both
miranda
and
innis
left
open,
specifically
whether
any
expressed
questions
asked
of
an
individual
in
custody
can
not
be
considered
interrogation
for
purposes
of
miranda.
specifically...
it
is
universally
accepted
that
booking
and
pedigree
questions
do
not
constitute
interrogation.
secondly,
there
are
a
series
of
cases
from
many
jurisdictions
relying
on
the
language
of
miranda
involving
general
on-the-scene
questioning
referring
to
questions
preliminary
or
neutral
or
designed
to
clarify
the
nature
of
the
situation
confronted.
what
all
of
these
cases
have
in
common
is
this
recognition
that
sometimes
expressed
questions
asked
of
an
individual
in
custody
may
not
constitute
interrogation.
i
think
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
question
asked.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
well,
given
that
the
offense
now...
the
only
charge
left
open
now
is
the
possession
of
the
weapon.
of
course,
it
does.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
incriminating,
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
answer
to
a
question
might
be
incriminating
or
is
even
likely
to
be
incriminating
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
miranda
prescribes
the
question
to
be
asked.
more
specifically
relevant
to
the
instant
case,
there
have
been
many
or
at
least
several
state
and
lower
court
cases
dealing
with
the
issue
of
questioning
a
defendant
about
the
presence
of
a
weapon
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
arrest.
and,
these
cases
have
generally
held
that
such
questioning
does
not
constitute
interrogation.
now,
sometimes
they
use
the
same
reasoning
as
the
general
on-the-scene
questioning
cases,
talking
about...
saying
that
the
question
about
a
weapon,
in
fact,
was
designed
to
clarify
the
nature
of
the
situation--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--yes,
of
course,
it
is
a
question
about
a
crime,
justice
marshall,
but
the
question,
what
is
going
on
here,
when
there
is
a
crime
going
on--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--i
think
in
this
situation
the
duty
of
officer
kraft
and
i
think,
apparent
from
the
record,
the
intention
of
officer
kraft
was
not
to
investigate
the
possession
of
a
weapon
or
even
to
investigate
the
rape
charge,
but
his
intention
was
to
secure
this
weapon.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
he
had
already
frisked
him
and
determined
that
the
weapon
was
not
on
the
defendant's
person,
but
it
could
have
been,
and
very
likely
was,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
respondent
in
a
supermarket,
and
the
obligation
of
the
police
officer
at
that
point
was
to
secure
that
weapon.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
of
course,
that
is
so.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
that
is
correct.
and,
the
fact
that
the
question
was
addressed
to
the
respondent,
as
opposed
to
someone
else
who
might
or
might
not
have
been
at
the
scene,
should
not
change
our
view
of
the
obligations
of
the
police
officer
in
that
instance.
his
obligation
was
to
secure
that
weapon.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
i
would
like
to
discuss
those.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
certainly.
just
to
conclude
on
this
issue,
however,
i
think
an
alternative
rationale
with
respect
to
the
admission
of
the
first
statement
would
be
to
say
that
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
you
call
this
interrogation
or
not,
but
the
exigent
circumstances
of
having
the
gun
loose
in
the
supermarket
overrode
the
necessity
for
miranda
warnings.
also,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
officer
had
a
right
to
search
the
defendant.
given
that
right,
it
is
up
to
congress
to
say
he
does
not
have
the
right
also
to
ask
him
where
the
gun
was.
whichever
theory
you
choose
to
use,
however,
the
point
is
that
officer
kraft
acted
properly
and,
given
that
fact,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppress
the
evidence.
now,
it
is
also
our
position
that
if,
in
fact,
it
is
found
that
the
defendant's
initial
statement
was
to
be
suppressed,
then
the
subsequent
statement
and
the
gun
itself
need
not
be
suppressed.
now,
first
of
all,
we
made
an
argument
regarding
michigan
versus
tucker,
and
as
i
think
you
were
alluding
to--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--we
made
that
argument
in
this
court.
we
did
not
make
that
argument
in
the
courts
below.
it
is
our
position
though
that
we
did
raise
the
federal
question
regarding
whether
the
derivative
evidence
had
to
be
excluded
given
the
initial
violation.
and,
in
what
court
or
courts
did
you
raise
that?
we
raised
that
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
new
york
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york.
in
the
hearing
court,
in
fact,
no
arguments
of
any
kind
were
made
by
the
representative
of
our
office.
we
do
not
think
that
precludes
us
from
raising
particular
issues
on
appeal.
if
the
record...
as
we--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--well,
that
is
exactly
our
position.
that
is
why
the
assistant
district
attorney,
who
was
at
that
hearing,
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
make
a
particular
argument
at
the
hearing.
again,
we
do
not
think
that
precludes
us
from
raising
these
issues
on
appeal.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
they--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--we
were
not
precluded
from
making
the
arguments.
in
fact,
the
state
appellate
division,
the
intermediate
court,
did
not
issue
a
decision
on
the
matter,
and
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
the
issue
of
inevitable
discovery.
we
do
not
think
that
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
it,
however,
that
that
necessarily
implies--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--well,
they
necessarily
rejected
it,
but
we
think
that
that
rejection
is
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
well,
with
respect
to
the
argument
with
regard
to
michigan
versus
tucker,
of
course,
we
believe
that
this
would
not
be
a
fifth
amendment
violation
even
if,
in
fact,
the
question
was
a
violation
of
this
court's
opinion
in
miranda.
the
conduct
at
issue
here
certainly
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
historical
practices
at
which
the
fifth
amendment
was
aimed.
therefore,
the
wong
sun
test
for
determining
the
admissibility
of
derivate
evidence
need
not
be
applied
and
there
should
be
a
balancing
between
the
benefits
and
detriments
of
exclusion
of
the
derivative
evidence.
we
think
if
one
does
that
balancing,
it
is
clear
that
the
deterrent
effect
of
excluding
the
derivative
evidence
is
minimal.
it
is
even
questionable
to
what
extent
the
exclusionary
rule
ever
really
deters
police
misconduct.
certainly
we
are
talking
about
derivative
evidence.
that
effect
is
even
lessened
because
the
police
officer
would
not
be
likely
to
want
to
risk
losing
the
full
confession
in
the
hope
of
gaining
derivative
evidence.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
this
case
has
not
been
tried
yet.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
we
would
not
introduce
it.
we
think
we
could
convict
the
defendant
only
on
what--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--so,
given
the
speculative
nature
of
the
deterrent
value
of
excluding
the
evidence,
that
is
balanced
against
the
interest
in
making
trustworthy
evidence
available.
we
think
that
the
derivative
evidence
would
be
admissible.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
inevitable
discovery,
very
briefly
we
think
that
there
is
no
question
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
that
gun
would
have
been
discovered
without
the
defendant's
statement.
we
don't
think
that
any
extensive
testimony,
any
testimony
at
all
other
than
that
which
appeared
on
the
record,
was
necessary
to
establish
that
fact.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
thank
you.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
its
opinion
in
michigan
versus
long
where
the
court
said
that
if,
in
fact,
the
state
court
wishes
to
base
its
decision
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
it
is
incumbent
upon
that
court
to
make
explicit
that
it
intends
to
do
so.
clearly,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
not
explicitly
base
its
decision
on
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
it
was
decided
before--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--well,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
court
had
not
made
that
explicit
prior
to
michigan
versus
long
does
not
mean
that
the
reasoning
in
that
case
should
not
be--
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
steven
j.
rappaport
well,
i
think
the
point
is
that
there
were
reasons
behind
this
court's
opinion
in
long
and
this
case
might
present
a
reason
for
the
application
of
that
principle.
the
only
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
could
be
interpreted
as
raising
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
is
the
portion
cited
by
counsel
where
he
said
that
the
people
never
raised
the
issue
of
the
safety
of
the
public
as
distinguished
from
the
safety
of
the
officers.
however,
the
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
record
did
not
establish
that
there
were,
in
fact,
those
circumstances.
it
is
that
finding
which
we
are
asking
the
court
to
review
now.
one
other
point.
counsel
characterized
our
discussion
of
miranda
as
permitting
an
open-ended
kind
of
activity
on
the
part
of
police
and
requiring
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
approach.
we
submit
that
we
are
doing
no
such
thing.
we
are
saying
that
objectively
speaking
any
time
there
is
a
gun
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
an
arrest
in
a
public
place,
it
is
reasonably
prudent
protective
measure
for
the
police
to
take
to
ask
about
the
location
of
