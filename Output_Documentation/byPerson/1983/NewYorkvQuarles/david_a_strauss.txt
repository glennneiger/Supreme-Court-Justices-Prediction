mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
rhode
island
against
innis,
the
court
specifically
excepted
from
its
definition
of
interrogation
questions
normally
attendant
to
arrest
and
custody.
and,
it
is
our
position
that
officer
kraft's
question,
where
is
the
gun,
belongs
to
a
definable
category
of
questions
that
are
incident
to
an
arrest;
that
is
to
say
his
question
was
part
of
the
process
of
safely
and
successfully
completing
the
arrest
of
respondent.
and,
in
our
view,
miranda
warnings
should
not
be
required
before
question
that
is
incident
to
an
arrest.
now,
when
respondent
was
asked,
where
is
the
gun,
he
had
undoubtedly
been
seized
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
it
has
been
assumed
all
along
that
he
had
been
arrested.
but,
it
does
not
follow,
as
the
court
below
seemed
to
believe,
that
he,
therefore,
had
to
be
given
miranda
warnings
immediately
before
he
was
asked
any
questions
whatsoever.
the
concepts
of
arrest
and
seizure
are
fourth
amendment
concepts.
miranda
rules
are
derived
from
the
fifth
amendment
which,
of
course,
serves
quite
different
purposes.
and,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
miranda
rules
necessarily
to
become
automatically
applicable
whenever
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
arrest.
that
does
not
serve
the
purposes
of
miranda
and,
very
importantly,
it
certainly
does
not
provide
police
officers
with
any
clearer
guidance
about
when
they
should
give
miranda
warnings
than
the
interpretation
of
miranda
that
we
propose.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor.
in
that
case,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
questions
they
asked
were
even
asked
roughly
at
the
same
time
of
the
arrest,
let
alone
that
they
were
necessary
to
completing
the
process
of
the
arrest.
i
think
orozco
can
be
understood
as
a
case
in
which
the
police
officers,
because
they
couldn't
bring
the
accused
to
the
station
house
and
interrogate
him
without
miranda
warnings.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
was
necessary
to
complete
the
process
of
arresting
him
safely
in
the
same
way
that
searches--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
handcuffs
had
been
placed
on
him,
but
the
officer...
certainly
no
prudent
officer
at
that
point,
having
heard
reliably
that
the
suspect
had
a
gun
and
having
found
an
empty
shoulder
holster
and
having
lost
sight
of
him
during
the
chase
for
10
or
15
seconds,
would
have
thought
that
he
could
relax
and
begin
the
process
of
investigating
the
crime
and
putting
the
respondent
in
jail.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
he
apparently
thought
so.
he
asked
for
the
gun.
and,
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
no--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
there
is
no
doubt,
justice
marshall,
that
he
could
have
conducted
a
search
incident
to
arrest
of
the
area
of
respondent,
of
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
he
did
the
more
prudent
thing.
he
asked
him
the
question.
a
search
incident
to
arrest
would
have
taken
some
time
and
during
that
time
the
gun
might
have
turned
up,
for
example,
in
the
hands
of
an
accomplice.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
this
was
not
an
abusive
action
or
a
coercive
action.
there
has
been
no
finding--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
has
been
no
finding
and,
i
think,
no
serious
suggestion
that
he
coerced
respondent
into
answering
the
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
is
coerced
into
not
moving
his
hands,
but
not
into
answering
a
question.
there
has
been
no
finding
to
that
effect.
a
search
incident
to
arrest--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
exactly
right,
justice
rehnquist.
a
terry
stop
is
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourt
amendment
by
definition.
a
terry
stop
is
a
situation
in
which
the
accused
can't
walk
away.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
is
nothing
that
says
in
a
terry
stop
the
officers
couldn't
handcuff
an
accused
if
they
thought
it
necessary.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
in
no
case
before
this
court,
but
i
suspect
strongly
that
in
some
terry
stops
accused
are
handcuffed.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right,
in
the
terry
case
itself.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
he
frisked--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that
is
right,
but
in
a
terry
stop--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
there
might
have
been
an
accomplice
or--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
most
logical
explanation
is
there
could
have
been
an
accomplice,
justice
marshall.
but,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
you
are
right
in
pointing
out
that
a
terry
stop
is
also
seizure
and
the
court
has
always
assumed,
and
the
lower
courts
have
consistently
held,
and
i
think
common
sense
dictates,
that
miranda
warnings
don't
have
to
be
given
before
questions
that
are
asked
during
a
terry
stop.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
that
is
reflected
in
the
record.
yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
rather
have
arrested
him
outside
the
store.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
didn't.
he
arrested
him
in
the
store
in
a
place
where
the
gun
could
have
been
hidden.
now,
given
that,
in
a
terry
stop,
miranda
warnings
don't
have
to
be
given
before
questioning.
and,
i
think
that
is
a
universal
assumption.
when
the
police
approach
a
suspect
and
order
him
to
stop
and
ask
him
a
few
questions,
the
suspect
probably
doesn't
know
in
the
first
few
minutes
whether
he
has
been
subjected
to
a
terry
stop
or
to
an
arrest.
so,
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
the
first
few
minutes
of
an
arrest
and
questions
asked
incident
to
the
arrest
should
be
regarded
as
more
coercive
and
more
in
need
of
miranda
warnings
than
a
terry
stop.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think...
our
position
now
is
that
the
question
has
to
be
part
of
completing
the
arrest
process,
so,
did
you
commit
the
crime,
would
not
be.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
but,
his
denying
it
is
not
going
to
cause
him
not
to
arrest
him,
justice
white.
you
don't
have
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question
if
you
have
decided
to
arrest
him.
if
he
says
no,
you
are
still
going
to
arrest
him.
i
should
also
say,
because
respondent
doesn't
actually
seem
to
argue
that
miranda
warnings
are
needed
during
the
first
few
minutes
of
an
arrest
or
few
moments
of
an
arrest
in
this
case
or
that
that
is
the
kind
of
situation
that
miranda
was
directed
to,
what
the
miranda
court
had
in
mind.
in
respondent's
argument--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
consistent
position
to
say
that
during
the
time
of
an
arrest
that
it
could
be
a
terry
stop.
you
could
ask
any
question.
but,
we
are
not
arguing
that
here,
justice
white.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
needs
a
bright-line
rule
of
some
kind.
we
think
the
incident
to
arrest
criteria--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
court
needs
to
supply
a
bright-line
rule
to
officers.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
is
right,
justice
white.
the
incident
to
arrest
criterion
is
a
familiar
one
from
other
areas
and
officers
don't
seem
to
have
inordinate
difficulty
applying
it
conducting
searches
incident.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
questions
that
are
designed
to
find...
like
searches
incident
to
arrest,
the
rationale
for
which
is
that
officers
need
to
find
a
weapon,
they
need
to
secure
their
own
safety.
that
is
part
of
what
they
have
to
do
to
complete
the
arrest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think,
under
the
search
incident
to
arrest
rationale,
evidence
that
might
be
destroyed
by
the
accused
before
he
is
arrested
might
be
included
in
that.
i
think
that
is
a
close
call.
and,
that
is,
of
course,
not
this
case
where
there
is
no
doubt--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
danger
is
an
important
part
of
it,
making
sure
that
the
person
is
the
person
who
you
think
he
is
is
an
important
part
of
it,
questions
along
those
lines.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
a
good
example,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
would
be
considerable
doubt
whether
the
suspect
in
that
situation
would
be
under
arrest
or
just
subject
to
a
terry
stop
or
may
be
subject
to
no
seizure
at
all.
in
fact,
the
officer
might
not
know,
the
suspect
might
not
know,
and
the
reviewing
court
might
not
know
into
what
fourth
amendment
pigeonhole
to
put
that
in--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
i
assume.
