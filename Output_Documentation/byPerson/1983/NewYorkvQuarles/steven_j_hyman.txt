mr.
steven
j.
hyman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
when
officer
kraft
frisked
before
other
officers,
surrounded,
apprehended,
frisked,
and
handcuffed
mr.
quarles
at
that
time
and
then
started
to
interrogate
him,
that
mr.
quarles
was
entitled
to
have
his
miranda
warnings
administered
prior
to
the
question,
where
is
the
gun?
as
this
court
is
aware,
the
only
charge
before
this
court
for
which
mr.
quarles
is
charged
is,
of
course,
the
gun
charge
itself
and
the
sole
basis
for
the
charge
is
his
words,
"the
gun
is
over
there",
and
then
the
location
of
the
weapon
itself.
i
believe
that
the
law,
as
this
court
has
framed
it
in
miranda,
is
settled
today
and--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that,
your
honor,
has
been
permitted
in
new
york
in
a
case
called
people
v.
chestnut
and
huffman.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
what
you
have...
and,
i
think
this
court
in
beheler
has
been
defining
the
nature
of
the
stop
involved.
i
think
that
the
first
order
is
whether
there
is
a
significant
restraint.
obviously
a
gun
can
be
a
significant
restraint.
but,
we
have
now
refined
that
further
and
have
come
to
the
extent
of
saying
arrest
or
restraint
on
freedom
of
movement
of
a
degree
associated
with
formal
arrest.
and,
what
i
submit
here,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
you
have
an
individual
who
has
been
handcuffed,
frisked,
and
arrested.
and,
when
you
have
those
standards
present,
miranda
must
be
administered.
where
there
is
a
point
of
clarification
coming
on
a
scene...
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
recognized
this
distinction
quite
well.
where
you
come
upon
a
scene
and
are
going
towards
a
defendant
and
you
may
have
a
gun
drawn,
so
he
may
not
at
that
moment
be
able
to
leave
safely,
you
do
not
have
to
say
you
have
a
right
to
remain
silent
before
i
question
you.
you
are
clarifying
the
situation
as
you
come
upon
it.
once,
however,
you
have
taken
that
step,
what
i
think
is
the
bright
line
that
we--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
difficult
question,
but
that
miranda
would
apply.
once
you
have
that
individual
in
custody,
once
you
have
taken
him
and
are
now
questioning
him,
you
have
put
his
fifth
amendment
rights
in
jeopardy
and
you
could
no
more
coerce
a
confession
out
of
him
as
you
could
to
try
and
obtain
it,
even
with
the
question
of
safety
at
issue.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
inherent
coercion
in
a
situation,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
the
handcuffs,
certainly.
you
have
here
the
classic
coercive
situation
that
miranda
was
aimed
at
when
you
apply
miranda
to
outside
the
station
house.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
excuse
me?
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
at
that
time,
your
honor,
he
might
not
have
been
in
the
degree
associated
with
formal
arrest.
i
think
that
beheler
made
this--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--there
is
a...
your
honor,
i
might
note
that
this
was
in
the...
not
to
beg
the
question
and
not
to
say--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--there
was
no
one
else
around,
your
honor.
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
there
was
no
one
else
around.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
page
25-a.
question:
"were
there
any
other
people
that
you
observed
at
that
time?
"
"no,
sir".
the
only
one...
i
should
note
no
other
people...
there
was
a
clerk
at
the
front
of
the
store
at
the
checkout.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
it
was
12:00
at
night.
it
is
a
24-hour
supermarket.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
apparently,
according
to
the
question...
now,
i
asked
that
question
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
he
observes
mr.
quarles
at
the
checkout
counter
with
the
clerk.
"were
there
any
other
people
that
you
observed
at
that
time?
"
"no,
sir".
and,
the
record
is
silent
about
anything
else.
at
no
time
is
there
indication
of--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--they
were
not
in
the
station
house.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
they
were,
but
he
was,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--but,
those
are
the
factors,
your
honor,
we
have
as
this
court
has
refined
miranda.
it
has
specifically
said
that
the
station
house--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--orozco.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes.
it
came
the
right
way,
your
honor,
but
it
was
five
to
four.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
no,
it
was.
justice
harlan
in
orozco,
your
honor,
did
join
the
majority.
he
indicated
that
under
stare
decisis
he
believed
that
the
miranda
rationale--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--justice
white
was
writing
the
most
eloquent.
[laughter]
but,
it
is,
your
honor,
a
situation
that...
and,
your
honor,
in
your
dissent
in
orozco
indicates
that
the
status
of
arrest
is
what
counts.
and,
i
think
we
have
achieved
a
very
clear
definition
of
miranda
today.
and,
what
we
now--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
you
have
permitted...
in
fact,
that
question,
of
course,
other
than,
your
honor,
in
neville,
indicating
its
applicability
or
that
there
is
no
miranda
need
with
regard
to
the
question
where
you
take
a
breathalyzer
test
is
that
where
it
is
a
non-incriminatory
question,
then
you
need
not
give
miranda
warnings.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
that
has
been,
but
is
it...
under
the
standard
enunciated
in
innis,
is
it
reasonably
likely
if
that
is
the
standard
to
be
applied
to
express
questioning.
is
it
reasonably
likely
to
incriminate...
to
elicit
an
incriminating
response,
i
submit,
is
not
likely
when
you
ask
what
is
your
name?
when
you
ask
where
is
the
gun,
then
you
have
certainly
crossed
the
line.
i
think
that
what
you
have--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that...
it
could
be
under
those
circumstances,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
the...
and
then
we
could
conceivably
have
a
miranda
question,
but
we
do
have
a
firm
rule
about
booking
and...
it
is
the
pedigree
information
is
a
clearly
defined
exception
that
the
courts
have
worked
out
over
the
years.
what
you
have
here,
however,
is
an
open-ended
situation
in
which
you
are
judging
the
questions
based
upon
the
circumstances.
and,
you
will,
i
believe,
be
introducing
a
new
totality
of
the
circumstance
standard
that
was
rejected
in
california
v.
beheler
and
was
rejected
when
an
individual
was
in
the
station
house.
i
submit
that
it
is
the
status
of
the
individual
that
he
has
been
placed
in;
that
is
not
the
place,
but
what
has
happened
to
him,
has
he
been
taken
into
custody.
and,
when
he
has
been
taken
into
custody
to
the
degree
associated
with
arrest,
i
submit
that
we
have
a
miranda
issue
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
subtle
law
in
the
supreme
court
as
this
court
as
enunciated.
i
believe
that
we
have
a
situation
here
in
which
certainly
in
this
record
you
do
not
have
a
safety
question.
you
can
hypothesize
factors,
but
in
the
record
before
us
we
do
not
have
another
accomplice.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
true
safety
issue.
the
officer
himself
on
cross-examination
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
indicated
that
in
his
mind
the
situation
was
definitely
under
control.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
of
course,
no
one
knew
where
the
gun
was
until--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--certainly
locating
a
weapon
can
be
an
issue.
if
someone
found
the
weapon,
it
could
be
an
issue
of
possible
harm
to
an
individual.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
but,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
innis
you
had
even
a
far
more
egregious
situation
of
a
shotgun
in
a
school
yard
near
handicapped
children.
and,
the
court
enunciated
rather
a
clear
standard
at
that
time.
and,
it
didn't
look...
it
could
have
at
that
time
said
no
miranda
warnings
are
required.
there
was
a
gun
in
the
school
yard.
instead,
you
look
to
the
nature
of
the
question
and
enunciated
that
once
an
individual
is
in
custody,
as
in
this
instance,
miranda
must
be
administered
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
question.
in
innis
you
specifically
did
not
use
the
safety
aspect
as
a
means
of
detracting
from
miranda.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes,
that
was
the...
but,
to
get
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
had
to
first,
i
believe,
in
reading
the
opinion,
and
you
specifically
stated
there,
reach
the
conclusion
that
miranda
was,
in
the
first
instance,
to
be
required
and
then
we
had
to
reach,
the
court,
the
question
of
what
is
questions,
what
is
interrogation
as
we
originally
enunciated
under
miranda
and
then
you
go
into
that
discussion.
but,
in
the
first
instance,
you
do
find
that
miranda
did
apply
and
that
safety
of
the
public--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
mr.
innis
certainly
could
have.
this
court,
however,
found
that--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
and--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--well,
in
this,
your
honor,
the
question
here,
of
course,
is
a
direct
one,
where
is
the
gun?
i
mean,
we
don't
have
a
functional
equivalent
here.
we
have
a
direct
question
with
a
direct
incriminating
question
that--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--it
was
a
discussion
between
police
officers.
this
court
found
that
it
did
not
rise
to
the
functional
equivalent,
that
it
was
not
words
or
actions
on
the
part
of
the
officers.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
well,
i--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
is
correct,
as
they
did
not
in
this
case.
but,
here
you
do
have--
if
we
are
to
find
standards
and
give
clear
guidance
to
police
officers,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
when
you
say
a
question
is
a
question
with
regard
to
reasonably
likely
to
cause
an
incriminating
statement,
you
must
give
miranda
warnings.
you
have
continued
the
firm
rule
that
has
been
established
in
this
court.
and,
i
suggest
that
quarles
fits
within
the
classic
definition
of
how
miranda
has
been
applied.
it
fits
within
the
custody,
it
fits
within
the
interrogation.
it
may
be
at
the
line,
but
if
we
are
to
move
the
line,
we
will
undo,
i
think,
the
very
firm
rules
that
this
court
has
so
carefully
enunciated.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
no,
your
honor.
there
is
a
case
called
u.s.
v.
watson
in
which
an
arrest
takes
place
in
a
restaurant,
as
i
recall,
and
this
court
comments
that
he
was
immediately
given
his
miranda
warnings.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
your
honor
has
certainly
put
my
argument
succinctly.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
it
is
the
inherent...
but,
it
is
also,
your
honor...
miranda
is
to
inform.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
no,
no,
it
certainly
did
not.
it
indicated
that
these--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but,
miranda's
purpose
is
also
to
inform.
and,
of
course,
a
public
place
no
more
informs
an
individual
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
the
purpose
of
miranda
is
to
say--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--but,
your
honor,
orozco
was
not
alone
in
a
station
house.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
i
don't
know
if
he
was
alone,
sir.
he
was
in
his
bedroom.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes,
there
were
three.
in
this
instance,
you
have
four,
possibly
six.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
in
a
supermarket,
yes,
your
honor.
i
wish
i
could
change
that
part
of
the
fact
pattern.
i
cannot.
it
is
in
a
public
place.
but,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
should
be
the
distinction
that
this
court
should
consider
in
arriving
at
a
standard
for
miranda.
miranda
itself
and
the
progeny
have
very
clearly
now
defined
that
it
is
not
the
place.
this
court,
i
believe,
in
mathias
and
o'beckwith
very
carefully
said
it
is
not
the
place
of
the
questioning,
it
is
the
nature
of
the
custody.
and,
i
submit
under
beheler
we
have
that
in
this
case.
now,
dealing
with,
i
think,
the
issue
of
if
this
court
does
find
a
miranda
violation,
the
question,
of
course,
is
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
and,
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
that
the
claim
with
regard
to
both
tucker...
that
is
that
derivative
evidence
should
not
be
admitted,
the
gun,
and
the
inevitable
discovery
aspect
of
it;
that
both
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
under
gates
and
under
michigan
v.
long,
this
court
has
set
down
the
framework
that
indicates
what
claims
should
or
should
not
be
before
it.
now,
if
i
may
first
deal
with
the
nature
of
the
record.
in
this
case,
no
aspect
of
inevitable
discovery
or
derivative
evidence
was
raised
in
the
court
below.
it
is
the
position
of
respondent,
substantiated
by
new
york
law,
that
the
issue
thereafter
was
not
preserved
by
the
people
to
now
argue
inevitable
discovery
or
to
argue
in
this
court
for
the
time
that
derivative
evidence
should
not
be
admitted.
the
law
in
new
york,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
is
clear
on
this
subject;
that
a
party
must
assert
its
arguments
below,
otherwise
they
will
not
be
listened
to
in
the
court
above.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
your
opinion
in
gates
you
at
least
intimate
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
arguments
be
asserted
below.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
except
in
new
york
that
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
presented.
it
is
our
argument
that
the
silence
by
the
new
york
courts,
particularly
on
the
issue,
which
was
the
only
one
raised,
inevitable
discovery,
is
that
that
is
silence
in
and
of
itself
is
an
indication
that
the
court
did
not
pass
on
it.
and,
new
york
has
recognized
inevitable
discovery
in
a
case
called
fitzpatrick
that
was
denied
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
i
have
never
checked.
that
certainly
has
never
come
out.
that
is
certainly
a
possibility,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
your
honor,
i
have
several
answers
on
that.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
okay.
first,
your
honor,
i
should
note
that
your
honor's
indication
with
respect
to
the
issue
about
raising
in
the
state
courts
is
not
present
at
all
with
the
issue
of
derivative
evidence.
at
no
time
in
any
of
the
state
courts,
either
the
trial
court,
the
appellate
division,
or
the
court
of
appeals
did
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
gun,
independent
of
the
statement,
be
admitted.
i
believe
that,
therefore,
the
claim,
as
this
court
has
defined
in
it
gates,
was
not
asserted,
so,
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
i
believe,
with
regard
to
that
issue,
it
certainly
has
not
been
preserved
to
here.
and,
that
would
only
leave
the
question
of
the
inevitable
discovery.
and,
that
is
one
aspect.
the
second,
your
honor,
is
that
there
could
be
a
separate
finding
by
the
state
court
on
the
issues
of
what
evidence
is
admissible
or
not
admissible
in
a
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
by
not
raising
the
issue
in
the
trial
court...
we
have
cases
that
have
indicated
that
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals
will
not
hear
argument
even
on
the
part
of
the
state
after
they
have
failed
to
make
that
argument
below.
there
is
a
case
not
cited
in
our
brief
called
people
v.
iochi,
which
is
at
61
appellate
division
2d
1,
which
indicates
that
the
people
themselves,
that
is
the
state
of
new
york,
whereas
here
the
defendants
were
not
placed
on
notice
that
the
people
were
resisting
the
applications
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
standing
and
the
defendant
might
have
introduced
proof
to
establish
their
right
to
make
the
application.
we
do
not
believe
that
we
should,
in
the
interest
of
justice,
entertain
the
question
now.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
in
evitable
discovery
that
there
is
a
burden,
and
without
a
hearing,
without
raising
that
issue
below,
we...
there
was
no
issue
upon
which
to
focus.
and,
the
court's
silence
with
regard
to
that
is,
i
believe,
a
significant
factor
and
it
is
not
that
they
did
not
want
to
pass
on
it,
they
did
not
have
the
authority
to
pass
on
it.
and,
their
silence
is
to
that
extent--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--you
have
the
power
to
review
de
novo
whether
a
federal
question
is
preserved,
but
you
must
at
the
same
time
determine
the
scope
of
what
the
state
law
is.
and,
under
street
versus
new
york,
justice
harlan
indicated
that
the
trial
court
must
be
the
place
where
the
first
argument
is
asserted.
and,
i
submit
that
in
reviewing
new
york
law
there
is,
i
think,
clear
question
that
under
new
york
law
the
issue
is
not
preserved
and
under--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--thank
you.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
jurisdictional
aspect,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
with
respect
to
the
preservation
issue,
the
court
does
not
deal,
of
course,
at
all
with
inevitable
discovery,
but
it
does
indicate
in
discussing
the
emergency
issue,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
not
so
far
as
it
appears
from
the
record
was
there
any
such
theory
advanced
by
the
people
at
the
suppression
hearing.
undeniably,
neither
of
the
courts
below
with
fact
finding
jurisdiction
made
any
factual
determination
that
the
police
acted
in
the
interest
of
public
safety.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
but,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
when
we
deal
with
the
question
of
inevitable
discovery,
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
if
this
court
is
to
acknowledge
that,
is
that
not,
i
believe,
a
factual
finding
to
be
made
by
the
lower
court
and
none
was
here.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
well,
except
that
the
standard
proposed
by
the
government
in
nix,
which
it
seeks
to
assert
in
this
case
as
well,
is
that
there
must
be
an
affirmative
showing,
there
must
be
a...
they
emphasize,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
need
for
findings
of
fact
and
in
new
york,
findings
of
fact
can
only
be
made
in
the
trial
court.
and,
the
failure
to
do
that--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
submit
that--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--i
do
not
know
and
i
am
not
trying
to
be
incredulous
with
the
court.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
the
point
is
that
to
find
the
gun
if
they
thought
it
existed
in
the
supermarket,
they
would
have
had
to
seal
the
supermarket
and
conducted
a
search.
would
they
have
done
so?
i
do
not
know.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
four
feet,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
it
was
inside
a
carton.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--that
can
be
an
assumption,
but
it
is
not--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--it
may
be
reasonable,
but
it
is
speculative.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
it
is
not
inevitable.
i
submit
that
in
this
case
it
is
not
inevitable.
it
may
have
been
probable.
it
may
have
been
done,
but...
and,
it
might
have
been
solved
by
a
few
questions
below.
had
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
raised
that
issue
below,
then
we
would
have
had
a
record
upon
which
to
deal
with
it.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
it
only
has
fact
finding
power
in
the
interest
of
justice.
and--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--it
would
not
have
been
in
the
interest
of
justice.
it
could
have,
if
it
had
so
desired,
determined
certain
findings
of
fact,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
must
give
in
the
law...
the
cases
we
cite
including
iochi...
it
must
give
great
deference
to
the
trial
court.
it
must...
it
is
essentially
bound--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--only
in
the
interest
of
justice
may
the
new
york
appellate
division
make
findings
of
fact.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
they
did
in
that
brief
raise
it
for
the
first
time.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
yes.
i
believe
that
michigan
v.
tucker
is
an
entirely
different
issue
and
a
different
theory
and
under
new
york
law--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--the
derivative
evidence.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
that
is
correct.
and,
the
findings--
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
--no,
but
the
claim
is
different
and
the
nature
of
what
is
sought
is
different.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
but,
new
york
law
puts
the
burden
on
the
people
and
it
says
very
clearly
in
its
decisions
that
it
must
be
raised
below.
now,
under
new
york
law
in
people
v.
huntley
it
says
that
the
burden
is
on
the
people
to
prove
that
which
they
are
seeking
to
introduce.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
but,
i
think
that...
the
discussion
in
gates
would
seem
at
least
there
must
be
an
equivalency
and
new
york
recognizes
that
equivalency.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
well,
i
might
also
note
that
what
makes
this
case
even
more
troublesome,
i
think,
than
gates
is
that
we
do
have
independent
state
grounds
upon
which
the
motion
was
made
that
the
new
york
law
could
be
that
it
would
admit
the
evidence.
there
is
statutory
basis
for
its
exclusion
rather
of
the
evidence
independent
of
federal
issues.
mr.
steven
j.
hyman
but,
its
silence,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe,
must
be
construed
that
there
were
grounds
that
prevented
it
considering
it.
i
believe
in
street
that
issue...
justice
harlan
indicated
that
where
there
is
silence,
there
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
silence
is
because
the
court
did
not
want
to
deal
with
the
issue
because
it
was
not
preserved
under
state
law
which
is
what
we
are
arguing
here.
they
did
not,
and,
in
fact,
did
not
deal
with
the
issue
because
it
was
not
preserved.
thank
you
very
much.
