mr.
charles
sovel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
the
pennsylvania
no-fault
system
when
a
person
is
injured,
he's
entitled
to
collect
his
basic
benefits
from
his
own
insurance
carrier.
those
basic
benefits
are
medical
expenses
and
a
portion
of
wage
loss.
it
goes
up
to
80
percent
of
the
wage
loss
up
to
$1,000
a
month.
if
the
person
is
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation
benefits,
then
he
must
take
those
workmen's
compensation
benefits,
and
the
amount
paid
by
the
no-fault
carrier
is
reduced
by
the
amount
that
the
workmen's
compensation
carrier
pays.
in
most
instances
the
effect
of
that
is
to
reduce
the
figure
to
zero
so
that
the
man
receives
his
workmen's
compensation
wage
loss
and
his
medical
expenses
from
his
employer.
the
statute
specifically
provides
and
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
have
so
held
that
the
workmen's
compensation
carrier
cannot
assert
a
right
of
subrogation
in
the
third
party
action.
the
third
party
action,
therefore,
is
limited
to
items
of
damages
not
covered
by
the
no-fault
benefit,
and
the
no-fault
benefit
in
turn
is
the
workmen's
compensation
benefit.
now,
in
effect,
you
have
a
new
type
of
recovery
for
an
injured
person.
instead
of
what
formerly
was
a
single
right
to
sue
a
third
party
to
recover
what
damages
you
were
entitled
to
as
medical
losses,
wage
losses
and
pain
and
suffering,
you
have
a
two-pronged
recovery:
one
of
no-fault
recovery
and
a
separate
one
for
amounts
not
covered
by
no-fault
against
the
third
party
if
you
can
prove
it.
the
effect
of
the
government's
position
here
is
to
deny
the
person
that
single
recovery
which
is
contemplated
by
state
law.
the
single
recovery
contemplated
by
state
law
is
a
no-fault
benefit
plus
a
right
to
sue
a
third
party.
the
government
is
saying
out
of
that
single
right
we're
going
to
reduce
that
single
right
of
recovery
by
making
you
pay
back
the
medical
expenses
that
you
have
received.
now,
when
congress
enacted--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
it
says
that,
if
your
honor
please,
only
if
you
interpret
the
word
"damages"
to
mean
damages
for
pain...
for
pain
and
suffering
only.
mr.
charles
sovel
no.
mr.
charles
sovel
i
interpret
the
word
"damages"
in
the
statute.
the
statute
reads,
"if
an
injury
of
death
for
which
compensation
is
payable
under
this
subchapter
is
caused
under
circumstances
creating
a
legal
liability
in
a
person
other
than
the
united
states
to
pay
damages.
"
now,
that
can
mean
a
whole
panoply
of
damages
arising
from
that
incident.
mr.
charles
sovel
and
including
property
damage.
but
no
one
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
the...
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
that's
why
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language...
the
language
has
no
plain
meaning.
"damages"
could
mean
any
other
types
of
damages
that
a...
the
tort
of
one
automobile
hitting
another
might
create.
it
would
include
property
damage.
and
they
admit
that
that
would
not
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
sovel
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that's
not
exactly
how
the
statute
reads.
it
says
if
the
circumstances
under
which
compensation
is
payable...
if
an
injury
or
death
occurs
under
circumstances
where
there's
an
obligation
to
pay
damages,
one
could
say
damages
for
injury
or
death;
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
the
statute
just
says
damages.
and
it
could
mean
damages,
any
damages
recoverable
under
that
particular
incident.
but
i...
i
think
more
important
is
to
try
to
get
a
plain
meaning
for
a
statute
that
has
been
enacted
and
reenacted
over
the
years
when
a
no-fault
program
and
the
changes
in
no-fault
were
not
contemplated.
to
try
to
read
a
plain
meaning
into
that
type
of
a
statute
would
be
unreasonable
in
terms
of
what
congress
might
have
intended
in
this
situation
or
did
intend.
congress
certainly,
in
enacting
the
statute,
did
not
attempt
to
prescribe
the
circumstances
under
which
a
third
party
recovery
would
be
made.
mr.
charles
sovel
i
would
be
making
the
same
point
i
made
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
in
that
his
third
party
recovery,
whatever
the
jury
found,
that
was
his
third
party
recovery,
and
that's
his
single
recovery
that
he's
entitled
to
the
benefit
of.
he's
not...
he
wouldn't
have...
his
third
party
recovery
reduced
by
what
he
has
to
pay
back
would
still
be
the
same
amount
for
the
third
party
recovery.
it
does...
there's
no
saying
that
a
jury
has
to
award
a
lot
for
pain
and...
for
pain
and
suffering,
or
it
might
find
that
a
different
amount
of--
mr.
charles
sovel
--no.
mr.
charles
sovel
no.
i
would--
mr.
charles
sovel
--i
would
not
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
charles
sovel
he
would
be
obligated
to
pay.
mr.
charles
sovel
because
his
third
party
recovery
for
damages
included
the
right
to
prove
in
that
third
party
action
his
medical
expenses
and
wage
loss.
mr.
charles
sovel
the
fact
that
the
jury
didn't
award--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
the
jury
didn't
find...
might
have
found
other
reasons
why
not.
we
don't...
you
never
know
what
goes
on
in
the
jury's
mind
in
awarding
it.
but
nonetheless,
you're
not
going
to
start
impeaching
a
jury's
verdict
and
trying
to
find
out
what
they
consider.
mr.
charles
sovel
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
right
of
action
that
is
brought
which
results
in
a
man
receiving
a
third
party
recovery--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
congress
decided
to
rest
on
state
law,
and
we're
not
going
to
prohibit
the
states
from
experimenting
with
different
types
of
recovery.
if
one
states
wants
to
have
comparative
negligence
and
another
wants
to
have
contributory
negligence,
the
result
may
well
be
different.
there
might
be
a...
if
a
state
had
contributed--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
there
might
be
no
recovery
in
a
given
case
because--
mr.
charles
sovel
--because
it
results
in
him
getting
less
than
whatever
the
single
recovery
was
that
the
state
law
contemplated
that
he
would
receive.
there's
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
treat
the
federal
employee
any
different
than
any
other
state
employee
injured
under
the
same
circumstances.
if
that
was
his
third
party
recovery,
that's
what
he's
supposed
to
receive.
it's
not
to
be
reduced
by
a
benefit
that
he
did
not
receive
in
terms
of
having
to
pay
back
the
medical
expenses
or
the
wage
losses.
in
the
third
party
action
a
man
may
recover
a
given
amount
for
pain
and
suffering.
he
may
recover
less.
he
may
recover
his
medical
expenses,
and
he
may
not.
but
he
was
allowed
to
prove
them,
and
they
were
part
of
his
third
party
damage
action.
in
this
case
he
was
barred
from
proving
his
medical
expenses
in
the
third
party
action.
he
was
barred
from
proving
his
wage
losses.
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
he
shouldn't
have
to
pay
back
something
that
he
was
barred
from
being
entitled
to
recover
under
the
law.
it
was
the
pennsylvania
legislature's
intention
that
he
get
those
benefits
as
a
matter
of
right;
that
they
not
be
covered
by
his
third
party
action.
the
government
doesn't
want
to
follow
state
law
in
this
area,
although
it
seems
to
be
satisfied
to
follow
state
law
in
every
other
area.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
correct.
mr.
charles
sovel
i
didn't
follow
your
last
part.
he
can't
bring
the
third
party
action
for
it.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
because
in
this
situation
there
is
no
no-fault
carrier.
it's
all
the
government.
mr.
charles
sovel
he
was
driving
a
government
vehicle.
now,
you
see,
in
this
situation
his
no-fault
carrier...
let's
suppose
he
had
a
vehicle,
and
under
pennsylvania
law,
if
he
had
his
own
automobile
and
he...
he
would
go
to
his
own
carrier
for
coverage,
in
that
situation
the
employer...
the
carrier
would
not
be
subrogated.
they'd
have
to
pay
it,
and
he'd
have
no
right--
mr.
charles
sovel
--yes.
mr.
charles
sovel
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
i
follow
you
question.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
he
would
have
his
rights
under
what
his
policy
would
be,
and
if
he
received
no
no-fault
benefits--
mr.
charles
sovel
--then
no.
then
he's
not
barred
from
suing
it
in
the
third
party
action
under
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
charles
sovel
because
the
no-fault
carrier
is
entitled
to
say
to
him,
in
turn,
you
received
compensation
benefits,
and
we're
entitled
to
the
credit
for
that
under
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
but
that--
mr.
charles
sovel
--well,
that...
that
would
really
put
you
right
around
in
a
circle.
the
pennsylvania
legislature
made
a
judgment
as
to
what
elements
it
was
going
to
include
in
the
fund
that
insurance
premiums
were
to
pay
for.
mr.
charles
sovel
that's
right.
mr.
charles
sovel
well,
i...
i
think
that
for
him
to
go
back
to
his
own
carrier
now,
i
don't
see
how
he
could
do
it
in
these
circumstances,
because
the
carrier
would
also
have
the
right
to
say
we're
entitled
to
get
the
benefit
of
workmen's
compensation,
and
therefore,
there
is
no
no-fault
liability,
and
the
state
court
would
turn
around
and
say
that's
a
correct
interpretation
of
our
statute.
it
really
comes
down
to,
i
think,
the...
the
government...
the
federal
government
always
would
seem
to
be
satisfied
to
accept
state
law
in
this
area.
it's
not
intending
to
define
the
circumstances
under
which
a
third
party
recovery
may
be
made.
pennsylvania
theoretically
could
totally
abolish
third
party
recovery
and
say
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
third
party
recovery.
you're
only
right
is
to
receive
workmen's
compensation.
the
government
would
be
out
its
compensation
benefits,
but
under
this
statute
it
couldn't
complain
of
that.
now,
that
would
be
a
different
rule
for
one
state
than
in
another
state.
but
it
seems
that
you're
dealing
with
a
state...
a
federal
statute
that
is
incorporating
by
state
law...
incorporating
state
law
and
should
be
bound
by
the
rights
that
that
state
law
creates
for
the
individual.
this
is
essentially
a
subrogation
provision.
i
do
not
accept
the
argument
that
there's
some
sort
of
separate
right
against
the
employee.
8132
just
is
another
element
of
interpreting
the
right
of
subrogation
that
is
started
8131.
it
says
if
the
man
makes
recovery,
he
has
to
pay
it
back.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
proper
interpretation.
it
treats
all
employees
fairly
and
equally
within
the
state
and
treats
all
federal
employees
equally
as
compared
to
the
various
states
in
which
they
are
employed.
thank
you.
