ms.
carolyn
corwin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
raised
in
this
case
concerns
the
interpretation
of
5
u.s.c.
8132,
the
reimbursement
provision
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
under
section
8132,
a
federal
employee
who
has
suffered
a
work-related
injury,
who
has
received
fica
benefits
on
account
of
that
injury,
and
who
sues
and
recovers
from
a
third
party
in
connection
with
that
injury,
must
reimburse
the
federal
government
out
of
his
third
party
recovery.
the
question
here
is
whether
that
statutory
duty
to
reimburse
exists
when
state
law
provides
that
the
third
party
recovery
may
not
include
damages
for
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages.
respondent
is
a
government
employee
who
was
injured
in
a
work-related
automobile
accident.
he
received
fica
benefits
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$2,000
which
allowed
him
to
pay
for
his
medical
expenses
and
made
up
for
his
lost
wages.
respondent
then
sued
the
driver
of
the
other
car
and
eventually
settled
for
$8,500.
the
secretary
of
labor
sought
reimbursement
for
the
fica
benefits
that
had
been
paid
out
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$1,600,
which
represented
the
fica
benefits
less
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
even
though
respondent's
recovery
was
more
than
five
times
the
amount
that
the
secretary
of
labor
was
seeking
to
be
reimbursed,
respondent
took
the
position
that
he
did
not
have
a
duty
to
reimburse
because
his
settlement
did
not
include
amounts
that
represented
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages.
that
is
because
the
pennsylvania
no-fault
insurance
statute
abolishes
tort
liability
for
economic
losses,
including
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages,
that
fall
below
the
ceiling
set
by
the
pennsylvania
statute
for
no-fault
coverage.
the
district
court
held
nevertheless
that
the
statute
section
8132
did
require
respondent
to
reimburse,
citing
the
ostrowski
case
from
the
sixth
circuit.
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
explicitly
rejected
the
ostrowski
case.
in
the
third
circuit's
view,
the
federal
government
was
to
be
a
model
employer
and
that
that
was
congress'
intent
underlying
the
statute.
for
that
reason
the
third
circuit
thought
that
section
8132
ought
to
be
interpreted
so
that
a
federal
employee
would
be
at
least
as
well
off
as
an
employee
covered
by
the
state
workers'
compensation
system.
because
the
pennsylvania
courts
had
held
that
under
the
state
workers'
compensation
law
a
compensation
carrier
would
not
be
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
an
employee
in
a
situation
like
that
of
respondent,
the
court
concluded
that
the
section
8132
of
the
federal
statute
should
not...
should
be
read
in
an
analogous
manner
to
the
pennsylvania
law.
our
position
in
this
case
is
a
straightforward
one.
first,
we
think
that
the
language
of
section
8132
on
its
face
requires
reimbursement
from
respondent
to
the
federal
government.
second,
we
think
that
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
believed,
the
result
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
that
underlie
the
reimbursement
provision.
now,
the
language
of
section
8132
seems
clearly
to
require
reimbursement
from
anything
that
an
employee
recovers
from
a
third
party
on
account
of
his
work-related
injury.
that
is
how
the
secretary
of
labor
has
always
read
this
statute.
section
8132
refers
to
money
or
other
property
an
employee
recovers--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i'm
referring
to
the
language
that...
that
talks
about
money
or
other
property,
and
that...
that
comes
within
the
first
sentence.
you
have
to
go
down
several
lines.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
it
is
a
long
sentence.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
right.
the
money
or
other
property
which
an
employee
recovers
in
satisfaction
of
the
third
party's
liability.
and
there's
a
reference
to
legal
liability
in
that
liability
in--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
the
legal
liability
to
which
it
refers
is
the
liability
of
the
third
party.
now,
you
can
go
back
to
the
injury
or
death
for
which
compensation
is
payable,
but
i
think
in
terms
of
the
damages
or
the
money
or
other
property,
that
refers
to
the
liability
of
the
third
party.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i...
i--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i...
i
think
that
certainly
on
its
face
the
statute
does
not
in
any
way
distinguish
among
the
different
sorts
of
damages
you
could
have.
it...
it
refers
to
the
liability.
it
refers
to
injury
or
death
for
which
compensation
is
payable,
but
it
doesn't--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--no.
and
we've
said
in
our
reply
brief
that's
never
been
the
position
of
the
secretary.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
it
refers
to
this
injury
or
death
for
which
compensation
is
payable.
under
the
fica
system,
fica
benefits
take
the
place
of
damages
for
personal
injury
and
not
for
property
injury.
if
someone...
if
someone's
damages...
property
is
damaged
in
a
work-related
situation,
there
is
a
separate
provision
in
title
31,
section
3721,
i
believe,
that
allows
you
to
present
a
claim
for
your
property
damage.
but
in
terms
of
the
compensation
scheme
we're
talking
about
here,
which
is
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
those
benefits
are
designed
to
take
the
place
of
what
you
would
ordinarily
get
for
your
personal
injury
as
a
result
of
a
work-related
accident.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
that...
that
is
how
the
benefits
are
measured,
but
in
terms
of
what
they
are
designed
to
replace
or...
or
represent,
that
is
the
employee's
exclusive
remedy
under
the
statutory
scheme;
that
is,
those
benefits
are
designed
to...
to
compensate
the
employee
for
any
sort
of
personal
injury.
that
is...
that
is
typical
of
a
statutory
compensation
scheme
in
that
respect.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well...
well,
under
fica
you...
you
receive
benefits
in
place
of
any
other
damages
you
might
get.
if...
if
you
are
injured
and
there
is
no
third
party
tort
fees
around,
you
get
your
fica
benefits
and
that's
all.
they
take
the
place
of
anything
that
you
would
otherwise
get
in...
if
you
were
allowed
to
bring
a
tort
suit
against
the
united
states,
for
example.
so
in
that
sense,
they
really...
they
take
the
place
of
any
sort
of
damages
within
the
statutory
compensation
scheme.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
there...
no,
there
is
no
amount
that
you
receive
that
is
denominated
pain
and
suffering;
but
when
you
look
to
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
the
fica
benefits
that...
that
are
received
by
an
employee
in
effect
take
the
place
of
any
sort
of
damages
you
might'
otherwise
recover
against
your
employer.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
no.
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
if
you're
comparing
it
to
state
schemes,
it
would
be
similar
in
the
respect
you've
suggested;
that
when
you're
measuring
the
amount
an
employee
gets,
you
generally
look
to
the
medical
expenses
incurred;
you
look
to
perhaps
a
payment
on
a
schedule
for
disability;
you
look
to
some
percentage
of
lost
wages.
but...
but
in
terms
of
the
balance
that's
been
struck
by
congress,
you
have
this...
this
lower
amount
of...
of
benefits
compared
to
what
you
might
recover
in
a
tort
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
you
get
it...
you
get
it
quickly;
you
get
it
without
regard
to
fault;
you
get
it
without
the
need
for
litigation.
so
you
strike
the
same
sort
of
balance
that
you
do
in
the
state
systems
to
which
you
refer.
now,
there's--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--there
is
no
amount
of
fica
benefits
that
is
measured
according
to
someone's
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering.
there
is
also...
there
is
no
indication
in
the
language
of
either
differentiation
among
different
types
of
damages
or
any
suggestion
that
the
right
of
reimbursement,
the
federal
governments'
right
as
against
the
third
party
recovery
of
the
employee,
no
suggestion
that
that
depends
in
any
way
on
the
substance
or
the
nature
of
the
employee's
cause
of
action.
the
bottom
line
is
when
we
read
8131
is
that
anything
you
recover
is
then
subject
to
this
federal
right
of
reimbursement.
now,
respondent
has
suggested
that
8132
is
merely
an
adjunct
to
section
8131
which
provides
that
the
secretary
may
require
the
employee
to
assign
his
right
of
action
to
the
secretary
to
the
united
states.
in
fact,
we
think
the
two
sections
create
somewhat
different
kinds
of
rights.
but
even
if
you
do
look
to
section
8131
for
guidance,
we
think
our
interpretation
ought
to
prevail.
the
secretary
may
require
an
assignment
of
the
right
of
action,
not
just
the
employee's
right
to
recover
for
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages.
the
way
assignment
would
work
is
that
the
secretary,
if
he
received
an
assignment,
would
recover
any
available
damages,
and
that
would
include
not
only
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages,
but
pain
and
suffering
or
punitive
damages
or
anything
else
the
employee
himself
might
recover.
then
at
that
point
the
secretary
would
take
away
from
the
recovery
the
amount
that
was
necessary
to
compensate
the...
the
fund
for
all
the
fica
benefits
that
had
been
paid
out.
and
only
after
that
if
there
were
some
excess
left
over
would
that
amount
be
paid
to
the
employee.
now,
that's...
that's
qualified
by
the
one-fifth
provision
that
came
in
in
1966,
but
really
the
principle
behind
it
is
that
the...
really
the...
the
reimbursement
of
the
compensation
fund
comes
first
under
either
8131
or
8132.
now,
the
court
skipped
over
the
language
of
the
statute
and
moved
directly
to
the
legislative
purposes.
we
don't
think
the
court
should
have
dismissed
the
language
so
summarily,
but
again,
even
if
you
do
look
at
congress'
purposes,
i
think
again
they
support
our
reading
of
the
statute.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
provisions
for
third
party
actions
and
for
reimbursement
under
fica
are
to
shift
a
part
of
the
cost
of
the
program
to
negligent
third
party
tort
feasors;
that
is,
congress
made
the
judgment
that
if
there
was
a
negligent
third
party
in
the
scene
whenever
there
was
a
work-related
accident,
it
was
that
tort
feasor
that
ought
to
bear
the
costs
of
those
particular
compensation
benefits
as
opposed
to
the
taxpayers.
now,
various
members
of
congress
expressed
concern
about
the
expense
of
the
program
back
in
1916.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
the...
the
employee
always
gets
the
fica
benefits.
i
mean
that
is
a
given
within
the
system.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
depending
on
the
situation,
depending
on
how
the
numbers
worked
out--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--no.
here
the
employee
got
more
than
four-fifths
of
his
own
recovery.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
of
course...
of
course,
he
had
received
the
fica
benefits
before
and
was
merely
paying
them
back.
i
mean
the
bottom
line
is
he
always
gets
an
amount
that's
equal
to
the
fica
benefits.
he
may
or
may
not--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--he
may
or
may
not
get
the
bonus
on
top
of
that.
but
as
to
the
statutory
compensation
scheme,
he
always
receives
the
fica
benefits.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
he
may
have
and
the
government
reimbursed
him
through
the
fica
benefits.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
in
that
that
$8,500
was
denominated
pain
and
suffering
and
yes,
part
of
that
went
to
recompense
the
fica
benefits.
that
still
left
him
with
quite
a
bit
left
over.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
third
party
recovery
in
this
case
we
have
agreed
represents
pain
and
suffering,
and
that
is
because
of
the
unusual
situation
that's
created
by
the
pennsylvania
no-fault
statute.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
in
many
cases
that
would
be
so.
now,
the
"unfairness"
or
anomaly
that
comes
in
here
is
created
because
on
top
of
the
federal
scheme,
the
federal
statutory
compensation
scheme,
there
is
overlaid
the
state
no-fault
insurance
scheme,
and
within
that
scheme
the
state
has
chosen
to
abolish
tort
liability
for
these
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages
below
a
certain
amount.
for
that
reason
the
settlement
or
a
third
party
recovery
in...
in
the
pennsylvania
situation
would
not
include
elements
like
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages.
but...
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
something
unusual
or
anomalous
about
that,
i
think
it...
it's
attributable
to
what
the
state
has
come
along
and
done
in
the
face
of
the
established
federal
program.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i...
it
depends
on...
on--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--i
mean
you
can...
you
can
shift
around
the
money
however
you
want.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
we
have
accepted
that.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
one
could
regard
it
that
way.
one
could
also
say--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--one
could
also
say
he
came
out
with...
with
the
medical
expenses
and
the
lost
wages
plus
something
on
top
of
that
as
a
result
of
the
third
party
recovery.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
suggest
that...
that
congress
when
it
was
structuring
the
federal
compensation
scheme
was
focusing
on
what
was
necessary
to
be
fair
to
the
employee
to
give
him
a
recovery
for
a
work-related
injury,
and
that
amount
is
measured
by
the
fica
benefits.
now,
if
there's
a
third
party
tort
feasor
in
the
picture,
you
may
also
get
something,
but
the
condition
within
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
you
first
apply
that
to
compensate
the
government.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
then--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--his
obligation
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
to
reimburse
the
federal
government
for
the
fica
benefits.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
whole
$1,600.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
sixteen
hundred
was
the
fica
benefits.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
government
initially--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--he...
well,
he
would
come
out
with
one-fifth,
because
in
1966
congress
provided
that
the
employee
would
always
get
at
least
one-fifth
of
some
third
party
recovery.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
so
the
bottom
line
is--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
yes.
he...
he
would
get
at
least
one-fifth.
now,
here
he
got
plenty
more
than
one-fifth.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
the
government
initially
paid
it.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
characterization,
and
i
think
that
one
has
to
start
out
from
the
premise
that
when
congress
was
setting
up
this
federal
compensation
scheme
that
it
felt
that
the...
the
proper
result
was
that
the
employee
should
get
fica
benefits.
those
were
benefits
that
took
the
place
of
a
tort
liability
system.
he
got
them
quickly,
he
got
them
without
regard
to
fault,
he
got
them
without
litigation.
now,
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
third
party
in
the
picture,
congress
concluded
that
that
third
party
as
opposed
to
the
taxpayer
to
be
bearing
the
cost
of
the
compensation
benefits
paid
out.
and
i
think
you
have
to
assume
that
that
is...
that
is
the
primary
purpose;
that
is
the
purpose
reflected
in
the
debates
on
this
measure.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
that--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
that's
right,
and
that
really
is
the
basis
of
the
scheme.
the
assumption
is
that
if
you're
in
a
work-related
injury
situation
that
you
get
the
compensation
payments,
you
get
the
fica
benefits,
and
that
in
itself
is
the
solution
under
the
statutory
compensation
scheme.
now...
now,
as
i
say,
if
there's
this
third
party,
you
may
have
something
on
top
of
that,
but
that's
not
necessarily
so.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
there...
the
way
the
pennsylvania
scheme
works
would
prevent
in
this
situation
no-fault
being...
benefits
being
paid.
the
way
it
works
is
that
the...
any
obligation
of
the
no-fault,
the
first
party
no-fault
insurer,
respondent's
own
insurer,
is
reduced
by
the
amount
of
workers'
compensation
or
other
government
benefits
that
the
employee
receives.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
no.
i
don't
think
there's...
there's
not
a
difference
in
the
two
situations
you
suggest.
the
individual
who's
employed
in
the
private
system
would...
would
be
forced
first
to
get
his
workers'
compensation,
and
the
no-fault
carrier
wouldn't
have
to
pay
anything
to
the
extent
the
workers'
compensation
carrier
had
done
so
under
the
state
system.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that
is
correct.
then...
then
you
would
recover
it
from
your
first
party
insurer,
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
that...
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
it's
not
unique
in
that
you
may
always
end
up
having
to
pay
everything
back.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that's
a
condition
of...
of
being
in
the
compensation
system.
you
may
also
have
situations
like
settling
for
less
than
you
had
claimed.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
or
being
in
a
comparative
negligence
state
and
having
your
recovery
reduced
in
which
you...
you
would
have
the
reimbursement
really
go
into
the
other
parts
of
your
damages
award.
and
that's
something
i
think
that
congress
was...
was
clearly
aware
of.
i
mean
you
didn't
have
no-fault
back
in
1916,
but
you
had
things
like
there...
there
was
a
specific
reference
to
settlement
in
the
statute,
so
congress
was
clearly
aware
that
you
might
end
up
with...
with
less
than...
than
all
of
your
damages
on
each
element.
there
were...
in
the
senate
debates
there
were
references
to
comparative
negligence
on
several
occasions,
so
they
again
recognized
that
that
sort
of
principle
might
be
at
work.
but
there
was...
there
was
no
expression
of
concern
about
protecting
those
elements
of
damages
like
pain
and
suffering
from
this
federal
right
to
reimbursement.
now,
there...
there
was
some
concern
about
protecting
the
damages
from
any
credit
against
compensation
for
some
future
injury.
congress
said
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
want
a
sword
of
damooles,
is
what
they
call
it,
hanging
over
the
employee
so
that
he
would
have
to
apply
all
of
his
recovery
sometime
in
the
future;
but
he
didn't...
he
didn't
know
it...
it
would
possibly
happen
to
him
some
day.
so
they...
they
put
in
some
language
that
said
this
right
of
reimbursement
doesn't
extend
beyond
that
same
injury;
but
there
was
no
effort
to...
to
protect
any
of
these
elements
of
damages
from
this...
what
appears
to
be
an
absolute
right
of
recovery.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
briefly
mention
another
consideration
we
think
underlies
the
statute,
and
that
is,
congress'
intent
to
create
a...
a
uniform
and
manageable
system
that
can
be
administered
on
a
nationwide
basis.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
the
administrative
difficulties
we
think
the
sort
of
test
fashioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
present.
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
indicated
anywhere
that...
that
it
anticipated
that
the
secretary
would
be
making
this
sort
of
state-by-state
adjustment
of
federal
rights.
and
in
the
absence
of
that
indication,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
read
it
into
the
statute.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
significant
that
reimbursement
was
not
necessary
here
in
order
to
prevent
double
recovery.
i
don't
dispute
that...
that
congress
may
have
had
this
prevention
of
double
recovery
in
mind
as
an
effect
of
this
reimbursement
provision.
that
was
not
the
only
purpose
of
the
provision,
and
i
don't...
it
was
certainly
not
the
decisive
provision.
i
think
the
point
was
to
put
the...
the
loss
of
the
compensation
benefits
on
the
tort
feasor,
not
on
the
compensation
system,
whenever
it
was
possible.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
focus
on
this
double
recovery
rationale,
i
think
it
could
have
drafted
the
statute
in
a
much
more
limited
manner.
now,
ultimately
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
fall
back
on
their
own
conceptions
of
fairness
to
federal
employees
and
on
the...
the
ideas
about
parity
between
federal
employees
and
others.
i
think
i've
pointed
out
that
in
our
view
it
is
pennsylvania
that
has
come
along
and
imposed
upon
the
fica
system
a
different
set
of
adjustments
of
rights
and
has
created
this
sort
of
situation.
it's
within
pennsylvania's
power
to
remedy
this
if
they
perceive
it
as
unfair.
their
legislature
can
do
it.
we
think
they
could
do
it
by
construing
their
statute
in
the
courts.
but
to
the
extent
that
pennsylvania
doesn't
take
care
of
this,
i
think
that
it
is
the
burden
of
congress
to
adjust
any
rights
if
it
perceives
that
this
is
an
unfair
situation.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
pennsylvania
has
construed
its
own
workers'
compensation
system
in
the
light
of
the
no-fault
scheme
and
has
said
in
that
case
there...
there's
only
a
right
of
subrogation
under
the
pennsylvania
scheme,
not
this
right
of
reimbursement
as
defined
in
section
8132.
but
as
to
the
subrogation
right,
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
held
that
that...
construing
the
two
statutes
together,
the
workers'
comp
and
the
no-fault,
that
the
workers'
compensation
carrier
is
not
subrogated
to
the
right,
so
the
employee
would
get
to
keep
the
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering.
but
here
i'd
point
out
you're
not
in
a
situation
in
which
you're
construing
two
statutes
that
have
been
passed
by
congress
together
in
trying
to
reconcile
them
in
the
way
that--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--yeah.
the
way
the
pennsylvania
court
was
trying
to
reconcile
its
two
state
statutes.
here
you
have
an
existing
federal
system.
you
have
something
changing
from
the
outside.
i
think
it's
similar
to
the
morrison-knudsen
situation.
here
the
change
from
the
outside
is
the
pennsylvania
no-fault
statute;
but
i
think
it's
up
to
congress
to
readjust
rights
within
the
federal
system
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
just
one
brief
point.
i'd
like
to
follow
up
with
justice
stevens'
question.
this
is...
this
is
something
that
can
be
solved
through
a
construction
of
state
law.
the
court
hasn't
done
it.
now
it's
open
to
them
to
do
it.
we've
suggested
in
our
brief
at
page
39,
note
25,
that
there
are
ways
that
the
courts
could
do
this
in
pennsylvania
if
they're
not
willing
to
do
it
now,
and
they
can
solve
this
problem
if
they
perceive
it
to
be
one.
