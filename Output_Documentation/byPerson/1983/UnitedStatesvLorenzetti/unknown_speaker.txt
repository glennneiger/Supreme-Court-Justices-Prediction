unknown
speaker
what
part
of
8132
are
you
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
that's
quite
a
sentence.
unknown
speaker
okay.
it's
six
lines.
i
guess
on
page
2a
of
the
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
"in
satisfaction
of
that
liability".
and,
of
course,
that
language
may
refer
back
to
just
to
the
fica
liability,
which
is
limited
in
nature
to
lost
wages
and
medical
benefits.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
clear,
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
something
else
to
determine
the
meaning
of
it,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
you
wouldn't
say
that
recovery
from
a
third
party
of
property
damage
is
going
to
be
payable
over
to
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
lost
wages
and
medical
expenses.
unknown
speaker
fica
doesn't
include
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
but
is
fica
set
up
so
that
it
includes
not
only
elements
for
lost
wages
and
medical
expenses,
but
also
some
sort
of
element
for
what
would
be
pain
and
suffering
in
a
jury
negligence
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
realize
that's
the
case.
i
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
fica
statute
is
like
i
understand
many
state
workmen's
compensation
statutes
to
be,
kind
of
giving
payment
for
things
other
than...
than
pain
and
suffering,
or
whether
fica
is...
if
you
took
a
fica,
the
average
actuarial
value
of
a
fica,
would
it
look
very
much
like
the
actuarial
value
of
a
jury
award
in
favor
of
a
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
well,
nothing
is
recovered
for
pain
and
suffering.
i
mean
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
right
there?
as
i
understand
the
way
this
works
out,
the
injured
employee
bears
at
least
four-fifths
of
the
cost
of
the
lost
wages
and
medical
benefits,
and
the
third
party
just
bears
the
expense
of
the
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
right.
but
he,
in
effect,
has
had
to
pay
four-fifths
of
those
benefits
to
the
government
out
of
the
recovery
he
got
for
pain
and
suffering,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
the
$8,500
was
for
pain
and
suffering,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
out
of
that
amount
he
had
to
reimburse
the
government
for
the
wages
and
medical
expense.
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
is
the
one
who
ultimately
bore
the
cost
of
the
wages
and
medical
expense
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
somebody
had
to
pay
the
hospital
bill
to
start
with,
and
i
assume
he
did.
unknown
speaker
right.
and
then
he
reimbursed
the
government.
so
at
the
bottom
line
is
that
he
paid
them
out
of
his
own
assets,
and
one
of
those
assets
was
his
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering,
isn't
that
correct?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it.
i'm
not
trying
to
debate
whether
it's
just
or
fair
or
anything.
but
that's
what
happened,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
it
also
include
loss
of
wages
and
special
damages,
other
special
damages...
the
third
party--
unknown
speaker
--well,
my
question
was
addressed
to
the
general
proposition.
when
the
recovery
is
had
against
the
third
person,
it
is
for
the
special
damages;
that
is,
medical
expenses,
loss
of
wages,
pain
and
suffering.
it's
a
whole
range
of
things
making
up
his
total
injury,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
said,
i
wasn't
debating
the
fairness
of
it;
but
the
net
result
of
it
is
that
he
pays
his
own
hospital
bill.
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
isn't
shifting
around,
because
the
$8,500
i
thought
you
stipulated
none
of
that
is
attributable
to
either
wages
or...
or
medical
expense.
i
mean
do
we
accept
that
or
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
accept
it,
doesn't
it
follow
he
paid
his
own
hospital
bill?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
must
regard
it,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
only
if
you
say
the
$8,500
includes
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages.
you're
assuming
there's
an
element
of
profit
in
recovering
on
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
corwin,
what
would
be
the
case
if
instead
of
$8,500
it
was
$1,500?
unknown
speaker
then
what's
his
obligation
to
reimburse?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
whole
$1,500--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
the
fica
benefits
were
$1,800
or
$1,600,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
let
me
change
that
from
$1,500
to
$1,600.
so
if
it
had
been...
if
he'd
got...
if
the
$8,500
was
$1,600,
he'd
have
to
pay
it
back.
then
justice
stevens'
question
would
have
to
be
answered
yes,
he
paid
his
own
hospital
bills,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
gave
it
back,
he
wouldn't
have
anything,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
he'd
get
$300
odd
dollars
or
something.
unknown
speaker
he's
paid
the
$1,600
hospital
bill.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
then
he
got
$1,600
from
the
government.
now
he's
giving
back
$1,300,
so
he
ends
up
with
a
net
of
$300.
and
he
certainly
pays
the
difference,
$1,300
of
the
hospital
bill,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
were
the
injured
employee,
i'd
still
feel
i
was
$1,300
out
of
pocket.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
has
the
compensation
payments.
he
doesn't
have
to
disgorge
those.
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
perhaps
your
opponent
can
speak
with
more
authority
than
you
can
on
this,
but
under
the
pennsylvania
statute,
granted
you
can
only
sue
for
basically
pain
and
suffering,
but
isn't
there
some
administrative
provision
or
some
provision
for
your
own
carrier,
your
own
insurance
carrier
to
pay
lost
wages
and
specials?
unknown
speaker
so
an
employee
of
a
private
employer
here
who
couldn't
claim
workmen's
compensation
could
have
claimed
something
from
the
first
insurer,
but
because
he
was
covered,
this
guy
was
covered
by
fica,
this
person
couldn't.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
an
injury
not
arising
out
of
in
the
course
of
employment
and
there
is
no
workmen's
compensation,
no
fica,
then
under
pennsylvania
law
the
first
liability
carrier
has
to
pay
specials?
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
in
a...
in
a
state
without
no-fault
or
without
some
system
like
pennsylvania's
and
you
sue
the
third
party,
you
can
recover
anything
you
can
get
out
of
them.
and
if
in
justice
brennan's
example,
if
you
recovered
from
a
third
party
only
$1,500,
and
you'd
only
been
paid
$1,500,
you're
going
to
have
to
refund
the
whole
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
whether
that's...
whatever
the
recovery
is.
and
so
this
case,
just
because
it
involved
recovery
of
pain
and
suffering,
doesn't
present
any
unique
problem.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
may
i
just
ask...
i'm
not
clear
in
my
own
mind.
supposing
the
injured
person
here
had
worked
for
a
pennsylvania
employer
and
received
benefits
under
their
workmen's
compensation
program
precisely
equal
to
this.
what
would
have
happened?
and
then
later
sued
and
got
the
same
recovery.
unknown
speaker
you
get
a
federal
statute
and
a
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
statute
seems
to
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
what
this
usually
refers
to
in
a
tort
suit?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
usually
refer
to
recoveries
for
pain
and
suffering?
unknown
speaker
including
damages
for
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
say
the
reason
why
it's
not
reasonable
is
a
reference
to
injury
and
death
necessarily
limits
it
to
the
kinds
of
injuries
or
damages
you
associate
with
personal
injury
rather
than
property
damage.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
this
had
come...
come
in
a
state
without
a
no-fault,
and
he
sued
the
third
party,
and
he
sued
him
for
lost
wages,
medical
expenses,
pain
and
suffering.
he
had
a
special
verdict,
and
the
jury
came
back
and
said
nothing
for...
no
specials,
no
wages,
no
nothing
except
pain
and
suffering,
and
$10,000
for
pain
and
suffering.
now,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
today
if...
if
this
had
come
up
in
a...
in
a...
not...
in
another
state
without
no-fault
and
the
jury--
unknown
speaker
--just
happened
to
award--
unknown
speaker
--damages
only
for
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
would
he?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
is...
the
only
thing
is
he
didn't
prove
any.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
impeaching
it
at
all.
you're
just...
you're
just...
he
just
says
well,
look,
all
you
ever
reimbursed
me
for
was
for
my
loss
of
wages
and
medical
expenses.
why
should
i
have
to
repay
you
out
of
my
damages
for
pain
and
suffering?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
these...
these
cases
ought
to
come
out
completely
differently
if
they
come
out
of
pennsylvania
or
other
states
with
no-fault
and
states
that
don't
have
no-fault.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
in
terms
of
the
obligation
to
repay
the
government.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe...
that
may
well
be,
but...
but
in
terms
of
his
obligation
to
pay,
i
don't
know...
i
don't
see
why
you
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
sovel,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
i
just
don't
quite
understand?
supposing
the...
your
client
had
been
unemployed,
say,
and
he
had
a
$1,500
hospital
bill.
unknown
speaker
and
he...
i
take
it
he
would
have
had
that
paid
out
by
the
no-fault
insurance
carrier.
unknown
speaker
because
he
was
not
paid
by
any
compensation
program.
why
can't
your
client
now
get
that
hospital
paid
in
that
manner
because
the
government
is
not
paying
it?
unknown
speaker
he
brings
the
third
party
action
and
gets
the
$8,500
for
pain
and
suffering.
unknown
speaker
and
he
goes
to
his
no-fault
carrier
and
says
i
had
to
give
part
of
that
money
back
to
the
government,
so
i
did
not
have
it
paid
by
the
government.
they
gave
me
the
money
and
took
it
back.
so
why
can't
i
get
it
from
my
no-fault
carrier?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
no-fault
carrier?
unknown
speaker
the
no-fault
insurance
is
paid
by
the
driver
himself.
unknown
speaker
he
pays
his
own
premium.
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
was
from
maryland?
i
just...
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--well,
supposing
he
was
not...
not...
does...
say
an
out-of-state
person,
must
he
carry
his
own
no-fault
insurance,
or
he
just
has
no
right
at
all,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
he's
just
out
of
luck.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
can't
he
now
say
i
did
not
get
any
no-fault...
i'm
not
getting...
the
net
result
of
my
arrangement
with
the
government
is
i
get
nothing
for
my
hospital
bill,
so
i
want
to
sue
the
third
party.
unknown
speaker
but
i
received
them,
but
i
couldn't
keep
them.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder.
i
must
say
i'm
puzzled.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understand
your
explanation
of
pennsylvania
law,
it
says
that
the
third
party
has
to
pay
the
hospital
bill
when
the
plaintiff
has
to
pay
it
himself.
and
the
net
result
of
your
analysis
is
he's
paying
his
own
hospital
bill.
unknown
speaker
so
i
would
think
he
ought
to
be
able
to
get
it
from
the
third
party.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
maybe
there
was
a
mistake
of
state
law
created...
well,
that's
out
of
this.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
