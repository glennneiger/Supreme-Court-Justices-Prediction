mr.
william
f.
baxter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
here
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government,
and
i
think
this
case
is
here
because
there
is
an
important
and
fundamental
conflict
between
the
policy
that
is
reflected
in
the
sylvania
decision
and
the
policy
that
is
reflected
in
dr.
miles
and
its
progeny.
each
of
those
two
rules
is
addressed
to
the
form
of
agreement.
non-price
agreements
are
to
be
judged
by
the
rule
of
reason.
price
agreements
are
illegal
per
se.
the
conflict
arises
because
non-price
agreements
work
only
through
and
to
the
extent
that
they
have
an
effect
on
intrabrand
pricing.
in
almost
all
commercial
contexts
the
two
different
types
of
agreement
will
have
the
same
function,
the
same
purpose,
and
the
same
basic
economic
effects,
and
accordingly,
will
leave
the
same
evidentiary
footprints,
if
i
might
put
it
that
way,
so
that
it
becomes
empirically
impossible
unless
we
have
evidence
about
the
form
of
agreement
to
know
which
it
was
that
was
involved.
if
both
these
rules
are
to
remain
operative...
and
i
assume
for
the
purposes
of
my
presentation
today
that
both
are
to
remain
operative...
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
build
a
fence
of
some
sort,
a
fence
that
will
produce
contained
enemies,
if
not
good
neighbors.
and
i
offer
to
the
court
the
following
reconciliation
of
these
two
bodies
of
doctrine.
if
a
supplier
adopts
a
bona
fide
program,
distribution
program
embodying
non-price
restrictions,
and
if
that
program
is
reasonably
addressed
to
an
identifiable
distributional
problem
such
as
the
dissemination
of
information
at
the
point
of
sale,
then
the
case
must
be
judged
by
the
rule
of
reason
unless
the
plaintiff
is
able
to
show
by
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence
that
there
was
an
explicit
agreement
about
the
prices
that
the
distributors
were
to
charge.
now,
if
i
may
stress
what
i
regard
as
the
most
critical
of
these
points
i
have
made
here,
namely
that
non-price
and
price
agreements
have
essentially
identical
functional
consequences,
i
would
like
to
say
there's
nothing
particularly
new
or
startling
about
that
proposition.
indeed,
the
shadow
of
that
proposition
appeared
in
the
sylvania
decision
itself,
most
visibly
in
justice
white's
concurring
opinion.
and
i
ask
you
to
consider
with
me
the
exact
role
that
was
seen
for
non-price
agreements
in
sylvania.
by
hypothesis,
a
supplier
has
decided
that
a
program
involving
non-price
restrictions
is
necessary
for
him
to
succeed
in
interbrand
competition.
now,
what
is
it
that
these
non-price
restrictions
are
to
achieve?
they
are
to
achieve,
as
sylvania
explicitly
recognized,
an
attenuation
of
intrabrand
price
competition,
an
attenuation
that
is
sufficient
to
allow
distributors
who
are
complying
and
incurring
the
costs
of
complying
with
non-price
restrictions
to
cover
those
costs
with
the
resulting
intrabrand
prices.
if
someone
else
not
complying
with
those
rules
is
beating
intrabrand
prices
down
below
a
level
which
is
sufficient
to
cover
the
compliance
with
the
programs
desired
by
the
supplier,
the
non-price
program
must
fail
in
its
purpose.
and
therefore,
if
sylvania
is
to
have
any
operational
meaning
as
opposed
to
existing
as
a
mere
theoretical
possibility
in
the
literature,
it
must
enable
a
supplier
under
these
circumstances
working
together
with
his
distributors
to
build
an
operational
non-price
program.
we
were
told
in
broadcast
music
that
the
characterization
of
conduct
that
was
arguably
subject
to
a
per
se
rule
was
not
to
be
determined
by
literal
definitions
but
by
a
sensible,
functional
approach
to
the
question
of
whether
the
behavior
had
desirable
efficiency
effects.
the
lesson
in
broadcast
music
in
this
context,
i
urge
upon
the
court,
is
to
recognize
the
need
for
functioning
a
fence
of
the
kind
i
have
described
so
that
both
the
sylvania
decision
and
dr.
miles
and
its
progeny
may
themselves
have
functional
roles
to
play
in
the
shaping
of
our
distribution
systems.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
no.
i
have
never
suggested...
oh,
i
am
not
suggesting
the
abandonment
of
the
per
se
rule
in
my
presentation
today.
section
2(b)
of
our
brief,
of
course,
is
addressed
to
that
point,
but
i
am
not
arguing
that
point
today.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
well,
it
would
depend,
justice
o'connor,
on
the
characteristics
of
the
case.
in
a
large
number
of
cases...
i
take
for
an
example
the
cernuto
decision
in
the
third
circuit
below...
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
an
articulated
non-price
set
of
restrictions
put
into
effect,
no
evidence
that
there
was
a
point
of
sale
problem
that
needed
to
be
addressed
by
point
of
sale
non-price
restrictions.
under
those
circumstances,
dr.
miles,
parke-davis,
et
cetera,
would
continue
to
apply
in
just
the
way
they
apply
today.
but,
as
i
indicated
in
what
i
proposed
as
an
accommodation,
if
a
supplier
was
able
to
show
that
he
had
adopted
an
articulated
program
involving
non-price
constraints
addressed
to
an
identifiable
problem
of
the
sort
that
sylvania
recognized,
a
distributional
problem
that
is
appropriately
addressed
by
non-price
restraints,
then
under
those
circumstances
a
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
that
in
addition
to
agreeing
on
the
non-price
restrictions,
there
was
an
explicit
agreement
with
respect
to
price.
it
would
change
the
burden
of
proof
faced
by
a
plaintiff
in
this
subcategory
of
cases.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
i
think
it
could
under
extreme
circumstances,
but
uniform
pricing
is
at
best
circumstantial
evidence,
and
often
it
is
not
very
probative.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
well,
that
is
a
problem,
of
course,
we
have
faced
for
many
years
in
the
area
of
horizontal
agreements.
the
problem
addressed
in
the
interstate
circuit
case
and
theater
enterprises.
one
simply
has
to
look
for
clues
whether
the
price
parallelism
is
really
telling
you
anything,
whether
it
is
merely
a
manifestation
of
intense
competition
which
tends
to
drive
prices
into
parallelism,
or
whether
they're
in
some
sense
that
parties
are
acting
against
their
self-interest,
restraining
their
own
competitive
efforts
in
an
attempt
to
work
in
cooperation
with
their
rivals.
it
is
not
an
easy
fact
question
to
sort
out.
i
don't
pretend
that
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
i
have
no
personal
opinion
on
that,
justice
stevens.
i
have
not
attempted
to
formulate
one.
this
case
is
here
because--
mr.
william
f.
baxter
--oh,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is
at
all,
sir.
i
believe
the
question
before
you
is
whether
the
seventh
circuit
applied
an
appropriate
legal
standard
in
addressing
itself
to
the
propriety
of
the
district
judge's
refusal
to
grant
the
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
and
my
position
today
is
that
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
apply
an
appropriate
legal
standard
in
addressing
itself
to
that
question.
the
question
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
is
a
very
different
question.
it
would
require
a
command
of
the
record
beyond
my
own,
and
i
express
no
view
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
baxter
we
have
not
withdrawn
part
2(b)
of
our
brief,
justice
o'connor.
beyond
that
i
would
prefer
not
to
deal
with
that
question.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
