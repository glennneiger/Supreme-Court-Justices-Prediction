mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
the
first
opportunity
for
this
court
to
consider
the
antitrust
illegality
of
non-price
vertical
restraints
since
the
1977
sylvania
decision.
sylvania
recognized
that
non-price
vertical
restraints
are
not
per
se
illegal
even
though
they
may
have
some
effect
on
price.
sylvania
said
that
the
rule
of
reason
would
apply
to
such
restraints,
and
noted
that
there
will
be
no
departure
from
the
rule
of
reason
unless
there
is
a
demonstrable
economic
effect,
not
formalistic
line
drawing.
despite
sylvania,
the
seventh
circuit
found
non-price
vertical
restraints
to
be
per
se
unlawful.
they
did
that,
petitioner
urges,
by
using
two
rules
of
law
that
seriously
cut
away
from
and
limit
the
usefulness
of
sylvania
to
businessmen.
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
this:
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
the
non-price
restraints
in
this
case
were
part
of
a
price-fixing
conspiracy.
they
used
a
rule
in
determining
whether
a
conspiracy
existed
which
makes
it
very
easy
to
find
a
resale
price
fixing
conspiracy.
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
all
you
need
is
an
interest
in
a
manufacturer
on
the
part
of
price,
a
concern
about
price,
which
you
will
almost
always
have,
coupled
with
complaints
from
distributors
followed
by
a
distributor
termination.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
situation
was
exacerbated
because
the
complaint
occurred...
the
last
complaint
of
record
occurred
15
months
prior
to
the
termination,
and
in
the
interval
between
the
last
complaint
and
the
termination,
there
was
a
renewal
of
the
distributor.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
no,
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not.
there
was
other
evidence.
we
don't
believe
it
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
conspiracy.
but
the
court
used
a
standard
for
finding
a
conspiracy
which
was
a
very
slender
standard
and
made
it
easy
to
get
to
a
jury
in
almost
any
business
context
on
the
question
of
the
underlying
conspiracy.
then
the
seventh
circuit,
having
made
it
easy
for
a
plaintiff
to
get
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
the
underlying
conspiracy
made
it
even
easier
for
the
jury
to
find
that
the
programs
in
question
were
part
of
the
conspiracy,
because
the
court
didn't
require
that
there
be
any
evidence
at
all
linking
the
programs
in
question
to
the
conspiracy.
the
result
is
that
it
is
now
very
easy
for
a
plaintiff
to
get
to
the
jury
any
time
a
manufacturer
uses
procompetitive,
non-price
programs
like
these.
we
think
that
it's
particularly
troublesome
in
this
case
where
the
economic
effect
of
the
programs
was
demonstrated
and
where
the
programs
are
so
much
like
those
in
sylvania.
sylvania
gave
an
example
of
the
kind
of
non-price
program
that
might
be
procompetitive,
even
though
it
was
a
restriction.
the
court
in
sylvania
said
that
there
might
be
instances
where
a
manufacturer
who
had
a
new
product
might
find
it
worthwhile
to
motivate
or
inspire
distributors
into
engaging
in
non-price
promotional
activities,
devoting
their
labor,
devoting
their
capital
to
selling
this
new
product
in
order
to
get
the
product
off
the
ground.
of
course,
that's
what
happened
here
in
this
case.
monsanto
had
a
new
product,
a
series
of
herbicides.
there
names
are
ramrod
and
lasso.
they
were
good
products.
they'd
been
around
for
a
number
of
years,
but
monsanto
hadn't
been
able
to
get
off
the
ground
with
these
products.
in
1968
monsanto
had
about
3
percent
of
the
soybean
market
and
about
15
percent
of
the
corn
market.
monsanto
was
facing
large,
dominant,
entrenched
competitors.
they
had
one
main
competitor
in
corn,
a
swiss
or
german
company
that
had
70
percent
of
the
market.
their
competitors
in
beans
had
between
them
about
70
percent
of
the
market.
monsanto
management
took
a
look
at
the
situation
and
tried
to
figure
out
why
if
the
products
were
good
hadn't
they
been
able
to
get
off
the
ground.
they
determined
that
it
was
a
question
of
customer
knowledge.
herbicides
can
kill
corn,
they
can
kill
crops.
farmers
were
sticking
with...
"dance
with
them
what
brung
you.
"
as
i
think
bear
bryant
once
said.
they
were
happy
with
the
products
that
had
done
the
job
in
the
past,
and
they
didn't
want
to
take
a
chance.
monsanto
felt
that
they
had
to
put
in
some
programs
which
would
encourage
distributors,
wholesale
distributors
to
get
out
in
the
grassroots,
in
the
farm
belt
and
get
across
the
story
of
monsanto
products,
and
that's
what
they
did.
monsanto
put
in
a
whole
series
of
sophisticated
marketing
programs
all
designed
to
create
an
incentive
for
the
distributors
to
get
out
and
do
the
job
of
educating
the
retail
stores
and
educating
the
farmers.
of
course,
the
farmers
would
go
to
grain
elevators
and
feed
stores
and
little
stores
throughout
the
farm
belt;
and
it
was
thought
necessary
to
have
distributors
who
would
go
out
and
do
the
job.
the
programs
were
interesting.
they
ranged
from
monsanto
actually
paying
cash
money
to
distributors
who
would
convince
the
employees
in
the
feed
stores
and
grain
elevators
to
go
to
technical
herbicide
schools
and
learn
about
the
product.
monsanto
paid
cash
money
for
distributors
who
would
go
out
and
get
the
products
on
the
shelves
early
in
the
season
so
they'd
be
there
when
the
farmers
came
in.
monsanto
had
a
territorialization
and
a
shipping
policy.
distributors
were
assigned
territories,
15
or
20
distributors
in
a
territory,
not
exclusive,
and
distributors
could
only
pick
up
at
shipping
points
within
their
territory.
so
they
would
be
focused
on
the
area
in
which
they
were
in,
and
they
would
try
to
do
a
good
job
at
developing
their
territory.
monsanto
also
announced...
and
this
was
the
first
thing
they
did...
petitioner
announced
that
we
want
distributors
who
will
get
out
in
the
farm
belt
and
do
the
grassroots
job
of
working
with
the
retail
stores
and
educating
them.
all
distributors
got
that
notice
a
year
in
advance
in
1967.
monsanto
told
distributors
if
you're
not
willing
to
do
that,
we're
not
going
to
work
with
you
in
the
future.
and
respondent
in
this
case,
respondent's
president
testified
he
understood
that
monsanto...
he
knew
what
monsanto
wanted,
and
he
understood
what
they
wanted,
and
he
knew
they
were
serious
about
it.
the
result
of
this
sophisticated
series
of
marketing
programs
was
very
procompetitive.
plaintiff's
expert
testified
that
the
programs
did
have
the
effect
desired
by
monsanto.
the
programs
did
tend
to
focus
the
distributor's
sales
attention
on
the
little
retail
stores
throughout
the
farm
belt.
and,
of
course,
the
market
share
figures,
the
bottom
line
market
share
figures
show
that
the
programs
work.
the
corn
market
went
from
a
market
in
which
monsanto
had
15
percent
and
geigy
had
70
percent
to
a
much
more
competitive
market.
monsanto
went
up
to
almost
30
percent,
and
geigy
down
to
50
or
55
percent.
the
same
thing
happened
in
soybeans.
the
plaintiff's
expert
testified
that
the
reasons
for
monsanto's
dramatic
improvement
in
the
four-year
period
from
1968
to
1972
were:
good
products,
which
we'd
always
had;
emphasis
on
technical
sales;
product
promotion;
and
monsanto
hired
a
lot
of
salesmen.
so
we
know
that
the
vertical
programs
in
this
case
actually
worked.
furthermore,
while
sylvania
acknowledged
that
to
achieve
these
kinds
of
gains
in
interbrand
competition
between
brands
of
two
different
manufacturers,
geigy
and
monsanto,
there
might
have
to
be
some
loss
of
intrabrand
competition...
that
is,
competition
between
monsanto's
various
distributors.
it
doesn't
look
like
there
was
much
diminution
of
intrabrand
competition
in
this
case,
because
what
happened
is
this.
this
market
had
always
been
characterized
by
deep,
intense
price
discounting,
and
it
continued
throughout
the
period
of
time
from
1968
to
1972.
indeed,
prices
were
lower
in
1972,
in
1971
than
they'd
been
back
in
1968.
so
we
didn't
see
a
situation
where
the
prices
that
were
paid
went
up
during
this
period
of
time.
similarly,
there
isn't
any
evidence
of
any
pattern
of
terminating
distributors
who
were
deep
price
cutters.
it's
true
that
the
distributor
who
was
terminated
in
this
case
had
been
a
price
cutter.
he'd
been
a
price
cutter
since
1963.
nothing
changed.
he'd
been--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--no.
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
there
was
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
have
concluded
that
that
was
at
least
part
of
monsanto's
motives.
that's
not
sufficient
to
find
a
conspiracy,
of
course.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
it's
not
sufficient
to
find
a
conspiracy.
that's
a
lawful
reason.
now,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
that
that
was
not
the
reason.
that
was--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
i
can't.
the
evidence...
the
evidence
showed
that,
by
way
of
background,
that
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
made
75
percent
of
his
sales
to
only
six
customers;
that
he
testified
that
he
didn't
have
salesmen;
that,
as
the
appendix
shows,
he
advertised
that
he...
his
margins
were
so
low
because
he
sold
as
a
broker
that
he
didn't
have
the
money
to
provide
the
services
which
he
admitted
were
required
in
this
technical
market.
that's
at
the
appendix
at
page
101,
his
own
advertisement.
but
nevertheless,
there
was
evidence
in
which
the
jury
was
entitled
to
disregard
all
of
that
evidence
and
determine
that
monsanto
had
a
price
motive.
the
effect
of
the
termination,
of
course,
there
was
no
effect
on
prices
in
the
marketplace.
there
was
vigorous
price
competition
at
all
times.
plaintiff's
expert
testified
at
trial...
and
this
is
a
quote...
that
the
market
was
"highly
competitive
at
all
times
before
and
after
the
termination...
highly
competitive
at
all
times
before
and
after
the
termination.
"
so
we
didn't
have
a
situation
where
products
were
in
the
hands
of
discounters,
and
after
the
decisions
were
made
and
the
programs
were
implemented
suddenly
people
were
paying
a
lot
more
for
toasters
or
mixmasters
or
whatever.
that
was
not
the
case
we
had
here.
the
programs
were
unusual
because
it
was
not
strictly
a
territorialization.
we
also
actually
paid
distributors
to
do
the
work
that
we
thought
they
had
to
do.
now,
at
trial
plaintiffs
agreed
on
the
record
that
there
was
no
claim
that
these
programs
violated
the
rule
of
reason,
nor
could
they
have,
i
suppose,
in
light
of
the
evidence
showing
what
happened
in
the
marketplace.
instead,
plaintiffs
said
that
they
were
part
of
price
fixing,
and
that
without
the
price
fixing,
the
programs
would
have
been
okay,
but
there
was
a
price
fixing
conspiracy.
they
said,
first,
there
was
a
resale
price
fixing
conspiracy;
and
second,
the
programs
were
part
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
the
key
to
this
case
and
the
reason
why
this
case
threatens
the
ability
of
businessmen
to
use
sylvania
is
this:
the
evidence
which
plaintiffs
relied
on
and
the
evidence
which
the
court
relied
on
in
finding
a
conspiracy
is
the
kind
of
evidence
which
one
would
expect
to
see
in
a
marketplace
where
you
have
people
like
monsanto
trying
to
stimulate
competition
with
other
brands
through
the
use
of
programs
like
this.
obviously,
on
the
fundamental
question
of
whether
there
was
a
price
fixing
conspiracy,
the
statement
of
the
court
below
that
all
one
needs
are
complaints,
price
concern,
followed
by
a
termination
fifteen
months
later.
you're
going
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
in
every
market,
and
the
ease
with
which
that
underlying
conspiracy
can
be
proven
threatens
this
court's
judgment
in
sylvania.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
no,
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
suggesting
that
a
standard
of
proof
for
a
conspiracy
be
adopted,
for
vertical
conspiracies,
which
is
consistent
with
this
court's
statement
of
the
rule
of
law
in
other
cases
like
machal,
other
decisions
of
this
court.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
never
found
a
price
fixing
conspiracy,
resale
vertical
price
fixing
conspiracy
based
on
the
termination
of
a
single
distributor.
it
has
never
done
that.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
took
the
position
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
the
question
of
a
vertical
resale
price
fixing
conspiracy
to
the
jury
on
this
case.
that's
the
position
we
took.
we
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
we
didn't
object
to
the
jury
instruction.
we
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
on
the
grounds
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
a
conspiracy.
there's
normal
marketplace
evidence,
the
kind
of
thing
one
would
expect
to
see.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
no,
justice
rehnquist.
but
if
a
court
adopts
as
a
rule
of
law
that
it's
sufficient
to
get
to
a
jury
if
all
you
have
are
the
kinds
of
activities
that
one
would
expect
to
find
in
any
competitive
market,
the
ease
with
which
a
conspiracy
can
be
found
threatens
the
use
of
programs
that
are
in
existence
at
the
same
time.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
justice
blackmun,
the
programs
were
put
into
effect
over
a
period
of
time.
in
1967--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--some
went
into
effect
before,
and
some
went
in
in
1968
simultaneous
with
the
termination.
the
distributors
were
notified
in
1967
that
monsanto
had
this
program
under
way.
more
and
more
sophisticated
vertical
programs
were
put
under
way
over
a
period
of
time.
the
second
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
require
no
real
evidence
of
any
linkage
between
the
vertical
programs
and
the
claimed
underlying
retail
price
fixing
conspiracy.
plaintiffs
relied
at
trial
and
rely
before
this
court
on
two
kinds
of
evidence.
first,
that
monsanto
was
concerned
about
prices.
one
would
expect
any
manufacturer
to
be
concerned
about
prices.
one
would
expect
a
manufacturer
like
monsanto
who
wanted
to
make
sure
that
distributors
had
the
wherewithal
to
engage
in
non-price
competition
to
be
interested
in
margins.
and
monsanto
was
interested
in
margins,
and
one
would
expect
that.
secondly,
the...
the
court
relied
on
internal
monsanto
documents
which
showed
that
in
putting
these
programs
into
the
field,
monsanto
was
considering
the
sizes,
the
margins,
was
considering
all
aspects
of
pricing,
as
one
would
expect.
the
result
of
this
decision
was
that,
a)
distribution
systems
are,
as
a
practical
matter,
frozen.
once
you
have
a
complaint,
no
matter
how
ancient
it
is,
you
can't
terminate
a
distributor.
second,
procompetitive
price...
procompetitive
non-price
vertical
restrictions
like
those
in
this
case
will
be
discouraged.
petitioner
urges
that
this
court
has
an
opportunity
to
draw
a
line
between
procompetitive
programs
like
this
which
don't
hurt
intrabrand
competition
and
benefit
interbrand
competition
and
true
programs
that
have
a
deleterious
effect
on
price.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
sir.
i
was
very
dramatically
taken
to
task
for
not
submitting
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
the
fact
is
i
did.
i
did.
page
3983
of
the
record
shows
monsanto
submitted
the
instruction
but
withdrew
it
when
spray-rite
abandoned
any
claim
that
the
programs
were
unlawful
under
the
rule
of
reason.
so
i
withdrew
the
instructions,
and
it
went
to
the
jury
on
a
per
se
standard.
we
say
there's
no
evidence
from
which
programs
like
this
which
are
procompetitive
can
be
per
se
unlawful,
so
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict.
we
would
have
been
delighted
to
have
submitted
this
case
on
a
rule
of
reason
basis.
second,
in
response
to
a
question,
respondent's
counsel
says
the
impetus
for
this
came
from
dealers.
now,
that's
not
right.
dealers
had
been
complaining
for
years,
and
we
did
nothing
until
we
got
in
a
marketing
situation
where
we
had
to
put
in
programs
in
order
to
succeed
against
an
entrenched
70
percent
competitor.
so
we
know
this
is
not
gm,
and
it's
not
sealy
where
the
impetus
was
a
horizontal
impetus
from
dealers.
it
came
from
a
manufacturer
who
was
in
trouble.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
the
directed
verdict
should
have
been
granted
on
two
grounds
and
that
the
court
should
remand
to
the
seventh
circuit
with
instructions
to
direct
the
lower
court
to
enter
a
directed
verdict
motion.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
your
honor,
the--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i
didn't.
and
that's
because
the
record
shows
that
2662
through
2680
and
in
the
appendix
at
a-23
that
there
was
no
claim
at
any
time
that
the
boycott
caused
any
of
the
damage
that
was
entered
in
this
case.
plaintiff's
expert
didn't
attribute
damage
to
the
post-termination
boycott.
it
was
a
separate
situation.
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
boycott
wasn't
one
of
them.
the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
fred
h.
bartlit,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
and
that's
the
seventh
circuit...
their
brief
at
page
33
and
the
seventh
circuit
at
a-23,
the
seventh
circuit
doesn't
attribute
any
damages
to
the
boycott.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
