mr.
bartlit,
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
the
only
evidence
before
the
court
of
appeals
were
complaints
from
distributors
plus
the
fact
of
termination
by
monsanto?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
he
was
terminated
because
he
was
a
price
cutter,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
now...
now,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
page
in
your
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
a-17,
which
is
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
finding.
it
says,
"yapp
testified
that
donald
fischer,
a
monsanto
district
manager,
told
him
that
monsanto
terminated
spray-rite
because
of
price
complaints
about
spray-rite.
"
now,
certainly
the
jury
was
entitled
to
believe
that.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
sufficient
to
find
the
reason
why
monsanto
terminated.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you...
you
can't
argue
that
here
after--
unknown
speaker
--a
jury
finding
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
suggesting
a
different
standard
of
proof
for
the
element
of
a
conspiracy
in
a
case
like
this
than
we
ordinarily
have
for
facts
to
be
found
by
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
this
court
is
not
ordinarily
a
finder
of
fact.
if
we
know
what
the
issue
is,
if
the
issue
is
one
of
conspiracy,
why
shouldn't
it
be
submitted
to
the
jury
the
same
way
other
issues
of
conspiracy
are
and
let
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
be
determined
by
the
ordinary
standards
that
are
used?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
"normal
marketplace
evidence",
that
doesn't
necessarily
to
me,
from
what
little
i
know
about
the
market,
negate
the
possibility
of
a
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
that's
typical
of
lots
of
mixed
motive
findings
of
fact.
mr.
bartlit,
let
me
try
to
get
the
chronology
straight.
when...
in
what
year
were
these
programs
put
into
effect?
unknown
speaker
well,
specifically,
did
they
go
into
effect
before
or
after
spray-rite's
termination?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
then
suggesting
an
abandonment
of
the
per
se
rule
in
all
circumstances,
mr.
baxter.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
were
to
follow
what
you're
arguing
today,
what
precisely
would
be
the
evidentiary
proof
that
it
would
take
to
get
to
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
could
evidence
of
uniform
retail
prices
constitute
evidence
of
an
explicit
agreement
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
a
district
judge
to
know
whether
there
are
extreme
circumstances
where
he
should
let
a
case
with
uniform
prices
go
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baxter,
what
about
this
case?
do
you
think
there's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
issue
before
us...
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us,
whether
there's
enough
evidence--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
baxter,
had
congress
not
adopted
the
proviso
in
its
appropriation
act,
would
you
have
made
possibly
a
different
argument
to
us
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
foote,
is
it
your
position
that
monsanto
could
not
unilaterally
discontinue
the
respondent
here
because
of
dissatisfaction
with
his
price
activities,
his
price
cutting?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
your
position
then
that
the
evidence
showed
that
the
price
stabilization
wasn't
just
a
unilateral
act
of
monsanto.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
pushed
on
them
really
by
some
of
the
dealers?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
where
did
the
impetus,
the
first
impetus,
according
to
the
evidence
in
this
case,
for
the
price
stabilization
come
from,
from
monsanto
or
from
the
dealer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foote,
could
i
ask
you--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
there's
some
confusion
in
the
briefs
as
to
exactly
when
the
last
dealer
complaint
took
place
prior
to
termination
of
spray-rite.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
your
opinion
that
15
months
did
not
elapse
between
the
last--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
petitioner
isn't
obligated
to
make
the
same
arguments
here
that
he
made
in
the
seventh
circuit.
in
fact,
a
sensible
counsel
would
probably
not
make
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
corresponding
citation
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
if
you
don't,
don't
worry.
i
just
wondered
if
you
had
it
offhand.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
a
question
of
fact
in
each
case
whether
the
non-price
restrictions
are
tied
to
the
price
restrictions?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
can
instruct
the
jury...
in
fact,
it
usually
does
instruct
the
jury
on
questions
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
i'm
just
going
to
quote
a
sentence
from
judge
bower's
opinion,
referring
to
the
sealy
court:
"the
court
rejected
sealy's
contention
and
held
that
the
manufacturing
and
resale
restrictions
were
unlawful
because
they
were
part
of
a
per
se
unlawful
price
fixing
scheme.
"
now,
must...
in
order
for
a
court
to
make
this,
must
a
jury
make
a
finding
that
the
non-price
restrictions
were
"part"
of
the
price
restriction?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
foote,
isn't
it
true
that
the
second
special
interrogatory
is
directed
at
precisely
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
point
they
didn't
need
to
analyze
it
under
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
then
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
was
the
evidence
that
showed
the
agreement
or
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
was
there
more
than
evidence
of
competitor
complaints--
unknown
speaker
--by
the--
unknown
speaker
--distributor
complaints.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
asking
is
what
was
the
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
or
agreement
other
than
the
complaints
by
the
distributors,
in
a
nutshell?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
evidence
was,
as
the
other
side
has
suggested,
simply
the
complaints
of
distributors
followed
by
the
termination.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
market...
the...
the
lasso
product
came
on
line
after
the
termination?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartlit,
can
i
ask
you
exactly
what
disposition
you
think
the
court
should
make
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
the
boycott
evidence,
the
post-termination
evidence?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
even
challenge
that,
if
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
you
had
a
footnote
on
your
brief
that
said
that
there
were
three
elements
of
damage,
and
we
couldn't
unscramble
them,
and
that's
why--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
say
as
a
matter
of
law,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
damages
flowing
from
the
boycott.
