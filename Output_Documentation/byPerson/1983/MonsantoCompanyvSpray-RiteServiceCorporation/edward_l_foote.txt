mr.
edward
l.
foote
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
decided
the
sylvania
case
in
a
decision
written
by
justice
powell
in
1977.
that
case
started
with
the
proposition
that
the
district
court
had
committed
error
in
giving
the
appropriate
instruction
to
the
jury.
the
district
court
was
asked
in
sylvania
to
give
the
jury
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
the
district
court
in
sylvania
refused
to
give
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
the
case
went
up,
and
this
court
decided
that
a
rule
of
reason
instruction
should
have
been
given.
that
was
in
1977.
now,
mr.
yapp
started
trial
in
rockford,
illinois
in
1980
in
january.
at
no
time
during
that
trial
did
monsanto
tell
judge
roskowski,
the
trial
judge,
that
he
ought
to
submit
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
indeed,
the
trial
court
was
instructed
on
this
issue
that
it
is
per
se
illegal
for
a
manufacturer
to
utilize
territorial
restrictions
pursuant
to
a
comprehensive
price
fixing
plan.
therefore,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
basically
agreed
on
a
stabilization
plan
and
the
resale
price
maintenance
was
part
of
that
or
part
of
a
plan
to
restrict
access
to
the
product,
then
you've
got
to
find
essentially
for
the
plaintiff.
there
was
no
objection
to
that
instruction.
indeed,
the
word
"pursuant
to"
in
the
instruction
was
suggested
by
monsanto's
counsel.
further,
the
court
was...
the
jury
was
instructed
that
under
the
per
se
rule,
you
don't
consider
business
justifications.
you
don't
consider
the
reasonableness
of
these
restraints.
when
this
case
was
in
the
seventh
circuit,
monsanto
told
the
seventh
circuit
that
they
should
apply
a
rule
of
reason
and
the
instruction
was
wrong.
that's
the
first
point
they
made
in
the
brief
they
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit.
we're
here
now
on
another
issue
it
seems,
but
how
are
we
going
to
try
cases
if
the
district
judge
isn't
first
given
the
opportunity
of
ruling
on
the
issue.
perhaps
mr.
baxter
should
have
tried
this
case
and
said
to
judge
roskowski
in
january
of
1980
please
instruct
the
jury
in
the
following
way
in
helping
you
determine
how
you
apply
the
facts
to
this
case.
but
that
isn't
what
happened.
that
isn't
what
happened
at
all.
indeed,
in
this
case,
in
the
reply
brief
monsanto
now
says
on
page
4
of
their
reply
brief
that
they
do
not
argue
the
jury
instructions.
if
they
do
not
argue
the
jury
instructions,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
jury
had
every
right
to
do
what
they
did.
the
jury
had
ample
evidence.
mr.
bartlit's
statement
to
this
court
is
not
a
statement
of
the
inferences
that
the
jury
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
resolve
in
favor
of
spray-rite.
that's
the
same
statement
mr.
bartlit
made
in
opening
statement
to
the
jury.
it's
the
same
statement
he
makes
now.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
monsanto
stabilized
the
price
of
lasso...
lasso
was
a
new
product;
it
came
out
in
1968.
lasso
determined
to
get
rid
of
price
cutting
on
this
productive
new
product.
the
jury
found
that
lasso
was
in
fact
a
success.
the
reason
it
was
a
success
is
because
it
was
proprietary,
and
the
farmer
is
the
person
who
had
to
pay
the
different
margin
as
a
result
of
a
price
stabilization
plan
that
monsanto
visited
upon
this
industry.
the
testimony
of
mr.
mccormick,
which
we've
cited
at
length
in
our
brief,
is
a
classic
case
of
how
you
go
about
to
stabilize
a
market.
he
contacted
every
distributor.
he
got
every
distributor
to
agree
to
the
procedure
and
those
that
didn't
they
cancelled,
they
coerced.
they
told
them
directly
if
you
sell
out
of
this
territory
which
we've
arbitrarily
set
up
as
a
primary
area
of
responsibility,
if
you
sell
outside
this
area,
we're
going
to
not
renew
your
contract
next
year.
they
did
the
same
thing
to
our
client,
mr.
yapp,
twice.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
under
colgate,
your
honor,
as
counsel,
all
of
us
agree,
you
can
unilaterally
do
about
anything
in
this
field.
our
point,
and
the
jury
believed
and
found
a
special
interrogatory
submitted
by
counsel
for
monsanto,
that
the
termination
was
part
of
a
stabilization
plan.
that
is
a
jury
question.
i
didn't
know,
and
i
suspect
the
court
very
seldom
has
cases
in
which
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury.
but
i'll
be
very
happy
to
reargue
that
case.
there's
an
ample
amount
of
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury
under
the
established
law
with
respect
to
the
agreements
of
other
distributors,
tacit
agreements.
as
an
example,
justice
rehnquist,
when
mr.
fischer,
the
gentleman
terminated,
my
client,
said
he
was
doing
it
because
of
price
complaints,
that
was
november
of
1968.
the
fall
season
had
begun
for
the
fall
and
winter
of
1968
and
'69
for
the
spring
planting,
and
monsanto
had
its
program
in
effect.
they
called
in
all
the
distributors,
and
they
told
the
distributors...
mr.
mccormick's
testimony
and
mr.
dilley's
testimony
is
absolutely
explicit...
they
called
them
all
in.
they
said
we're
going
to
stabilize
the
price
of
a
new
product,
lasso.
we
want
you
to
follow
the
prices.
we
want
you
to
follow
our
suggested
prices.
they
did
follow
the
suggested
prices.
at
the
same
time
that
mr.
fischer
was
telling
our
client
that
he
was
terminated
because
of
price
complaints,
mr.
bailey,
who
is
like...
mr.
bailey
is
like
in
the
general
motors
case
that
came
out
of
california,
there
were
chevrolet
dealers
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
discount
houses.
they
asked
general
motors
to
help
them.
mr.
bailey
was
like
those
chevrolet
dealers
who
wanted
the
discount
eliminated.
he,
having
met
with
the
management
at
a
district
meeting
in
st.
louis,
went
back
to
minneapolis
and
wrote
a
memorandum
to
the
dealers
saying
we've
finally
arrived
at
a
situation
where
monsanto
recognizes
it's
got
to
take
care
of
this
problem.
their
stores...
they
had
competing
stores...
are
going
to
use
the
suggested
prices.
a
blessing
really
has
fallen
on
us.
none
of
us
will
obviously
cut
the
price
because
it
will
risk
termination,
continuity
of
our
dealership.
it
is
a
document
that
so
reeks
with
a
kind
of
antitrust
behavior
that
when
monsanto
found
out
about
it,
they
wrote
them
and
said
gee,
we
really
didn't
say
that.
but
that's
what
he
testified
to
in
front
of
the
jury.
and
he
said
when
i
left
that
meeting,
i
knew
that
monsanto
wanted
me
to
use
the
resale
prices.
and
he
was
delighted
to
do
it.
he
was
like
the
folks,
the
chevrolet
dealers
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
another
kind
of
an
outlet.
now,
our
client
was
the
other
kind
of
an
outlet.
so
was
mr.
mulvahill
who
did
more
for
the
farmers
up
in
minnesota
and
north
dakota
than
anybody.
he
was
the
yapp
of
that
area.
and
they
cancelled
him
after
telling
him
to
his
face,
if
you
don't
stay
in
this
little
territory
that
we've
sent
you,
we're
going
to
cancel
you.
you
can't--
after
they
terminated
my
client
they
had
face-to-face
meetings
with
him
in
which
they
said
if
you
sell
to
mr.
yapp,
we'll
terminate
you.
don't
sell
to
mr.
yapp.
so
he
didn't.
he
had
to
acquiesce
to
that
form
of
activity.
so
when
we
talk
about
a
statement
of
facts,
it
is
true
that
the
jury
could
have
believed
that
all
of
these
programs
were
innocent.
they
didn't.
my
own
view
is
the
jury
had
no
alternative
under
the
instruction
it
was
given...
it
was
not
objected
to...
to
find
that
these
primary
areas
of
responsibility
were
created
as
part
of
a
plan
to
help
stabilize
the
market.
in
fact,
mr.
mccormick,
the
representative
who
called
on
these
various
dealers,
distributors,
said
that's
how
we
interpreted
it,
that
the
primary
area
of
responsibility
meant
they
had
to
sell
in
that
area.
they
couldn't
sell
outside.
why
not?
because
they
didn't
want
people
like
mulvahill
and
other
discounters
and
price
discounters
to
go
outside
their
area
and
discount
the
price.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
absolutely.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
some
of
the
dealers
loved
it.
others
it
had
to
push
on.
it's
a
classic
case,
as
justice
brennan
some
years
ago
in
parke-davis
talked
about
a
situation
where
some
of
the
drugstores,
some
of
the
parke-davis
outlets
were
willing
to
go
along
with
the
suggested
prices;
others
were
unwilling.
they
had
to
be
talked
to.
and
those
that
were
unwilling
didn't
get
any
product.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
we
have
here.
it's
the
same
situation
i
respectfully
suggest
the
court
considered
in
the
general
motors
case.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
i
think
originally
it
came
from
the
dealers.
the
dealers
did
not...
any
of
the
dealers
did
not
like
to
have
price
competition
between
territories.
they
complained
to
monsanto
about
that.
one
of
the
top
people
at
monsanto,
mr.
arvin,
then
came
to
my
client's
door
and
said
you
are
not
using
dealer
prices.
you
are
selling
into
another
area
at
low
prices.
and
he
acknowledged
it.
he
said
well,
if
you
don't
get
your
prices
up,
we're
going
to
cancel
your
distributorship.
one
and
a
half
years
later,
acting
again
on
complaints,
this
time
from
mr.
hopkins,
the
same
gentleman
who
signed
our
client's
dealer
agreement,
a
mr.
bone,
appears,
and
he
says
to
mr.
yapp
on
a
telephone,
i'm
sending
you
our
dealer
prices.
you're
not
using
them.
you're
going
into
other
areas.
you've
got
to
use
our
dealer
prices.
if
you
don't
use
our
dealer
prices,
we
will
retaliate
against
you.
a
few
months
later
they
did
retaliate.
it's
a
mixed
question,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well,
i
think
mr.
stein
testified
in
the
summer
of
1968
that
he
reviewed
in
the
district
office
in
st.
louis
a
number
of
complaints
because
it
was
the
attitude
at
that
time
of
the
management
in
st.
louis
that
they
continuously
get
complaints.
now,
there's
a
footnote
in
the
brief
that
says
that
that
evidence
is
not
before
the
court
because
another
part
of
mr.
stein's
testimony,
i
believe,
was
limited
by
the
seventh
circuit.
but
the
briefs
on
that
are
explicit,
if
the
court
please.
the
question
they
asked
mr.
stein
that
was
limited
as
a
result
of
the
seventh
circuit
decision
was
his
opinion,
since
he
wasn't
present
and
didn't
participate,
on
why
my
client
was
terminated.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
correct.
indeed,
mr.
fischer,
when
he
terminated
my
client
said
we've
received
many,
many
complaints
from
the
field,
and
that
was
in
november
of
1968.
the
jury
had
a
perfect
right
to
believe
that
what
mr.
fischer
was
talking
about
were
complaints
from
the
distributors.
the
inference
of
that
is
a
jury
question.
but
what
are
we
doing
in
this
court.
i
read
the
attorney
general's
brief
when
they
asked
the
court
to
take
the
case,
and
they
said
they
wanted
you
to
change
the
rule
of
reason.
they
suggested
you
use
it
as
an
opportunity
to
change
the
per
se
rule
to
a
rule
of
reason.
counsel
said
the
same
thing
to
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
of
course,
we
now
know
that
they
do
not
question
the
jury
instruction
that
was
given
in
this
case,
which
plainly
says
this
is
per
se
illegal.
and
the
issue,
the
issue
on
the
question
of
the
per
se
instruction
as
to
whether
non-price
restrictions
limiting
the
territory
is
part
of
price
stabilization
was
sent
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
appeal
on
that
was
the
jury
instruction.
issues
presented
for
review,
page
3
of
the
brief,
in
the
seventh
circuit.
did
the
district
court
err
in
refusing
to
apply
the
rule
of
reason
of
sylvania
to
monsanto's
marketing
programs?
that's
the
first
issue.
that
was
briefed
for
ten
pages.
now,
when
you
come
to
the
directed
verdict
issue,
what
was
the
issue
that
was
requested?
five.
there
were
some
damage
issues.
i'm
not
going
to
address
those,
of
course.
did
the
district
court
err
in
denying
monsanto's
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
on
the
issue
of
whether
monsanto
and
its
distributors
conspired
to
fix
the
resale
price
of
herbicides?
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well,
i've
got
to
concede
that
mr.
bartlit
is
a
sensible
counsel,
your
honor,
so
i
suppose
he
would
want
to
go
beyond
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
know
what
he
asked
the
seventh
circuit
to
do
in
order
to
understand
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion.
that's
my
point.
the
seventh
circuit
did
not
address,
as
counsel
mistakenly
argued
to
this
court,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
these
nonrestrictive,
nonrestrictive,
i
mean
non-price
restrictive,
issues.
that
is
covered
in
the
court's
decision
under
the
instructions
section.
this
opinion
is
divided
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
discusses
the
jury
instruction,
and
then
at
page
1238
you
come
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
counsel
preserved
and
wanted
the
seventh
circuit
to
decide
two
issues
under
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence:
the
boycott
issue
and
the
general
price
stabilization
issue.
under
the
jury
instructions
section,
which
counsel
now
say
to
this
court
they're
not
questioning,
is
where
they
asked
the
seventh
circuit
to
apply
the
sylvania
case
to
non-price
restrictions.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
their
criticism
of
judge
bower's
decision
is
plainly
unfair.
at
page
1237
of
the
opinion
of
judge
power
in
answer
to
the
question
what
kind
of
jury
instruction
should
we
give...
mind
you,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
they
never
gave
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
they
never
asked
for
a
rule
of
reason
instruction.
the
court
had
no
alternative
but
to
get
a
per
se
instruction.
but
passing
that
point,
the
seventh
circuit
at
pages
1236
and
1237
of
fed
second
684--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
--i
do
not
handily,
i'm
sorry,
justice
rehnquist.
but
at
this
point,
the
court
is
discussing
sylvania
and
comparing
it
with
this
court's
sealy
decision
and
saying
what
is
obvious,
that
in
sealy,
in
sealy
this
court
said
that
territorial
restrictions
are
invalid
if
they're
part
of
a
price
stabilization
program.
remember
how
that
case
came
up.
the
district
court
found
price
stabilization.
also
found
problems
in
the
territorial
restrictions.
a
former,
later
on
head
of
the
antitrust
division,
dick
mcclaren,
argued
that
case
to
this
court,
and
said
to
this
court
well,
don't
consider
the
price
fixing
issue.
we
want
you
to
consider
only
the
isolated
problem
of
territorial
restrictions
as
they
relate
to
our
business.
and
this
court
appropriately
said
we're
not
going
to
do
that.
the
territorial
restrictions
are
part
of
the
price
fixing.
exactly
the
case
we've
got
here.
judge
bower
did
exactly...
judge
power,
in
looking
at
this,
did
not
reject
sylvania.
he
said
sylvania
applies
to
a
situation
that
the
court
has
outlined,
non-price
restrictions
that
do
not
involve
price
stabilization.
sealy
involves
cases
in
which
there
are
non-price
restrictions
that
are
tied
to
price
stabilization.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
what
the
court
instructs
the
jury.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
oh,
but
in
setting
the
standard
the
court
has
to
tell
the
jury
to
what
extent
in
each
case,
as
was
done
in
this
case,
the
jury
has
to
be
instructed,
as
they
were,
that
unilateral
actions
are
not
unlawful.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
well,
if
i
wanted
to
preserve
this
point
and
it
was
january
of
1980,
i
would
tell
judge
roskowski
put
it
up
alternatively.
say
to
the
jury
the
first
thing
you've
got
to
find
is
whether
or
not
these
price
restrictions...
non-price
restrictions
are
part
of
a
stabilization
program.
but
the
only
instruction
given
to
the
jury
was
that
if
you
find
that
the
non-price
restrictions
are
part
of
stabilization,
then
it's
unlawful
per
se
because
that's
what
monsanto
and
spray-rite
agreed
was
the
instruction.
so
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
or
justice--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
--it
is.
and
the
answer
was
for
spray-rite.
in
fact,
that
was
because
of
the
damage
issue.
because
of
the
mci
case
and
other
problems,
monsanto
argued
that
we
couldn't
desegregate
our
damages.
and
they
asked
the
court
to
submit
interrogatories
so
that
if
they
got
one
answer
on
one
of
the
issues,
they
could
then
argue
that
our
damages
were
not
desegregated.
and
i
think
there's...
but
the
effect
of
it
is
that
the
special
interrogatory
was
answered
by
the
jury
in
our
favor
and
says
that
the
non-price
restrictions
were
part
of
a
stabilization
of
price
plan.
but
the
argument
made
before
i
stood
up
here
was
that
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
non-price
restrictions.
it
did
not.
it
analyzed
the
question
of
what
the
proper
instruction
should
be.
when
you
get
over
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
point,
which
is
again
and--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
--they
weren't
asked
to.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
pardon
me,
chief
justice.
they
were
asked
to
evaluate
the
sufficiency
of
the
directed
verdict
on
whether
the
termination
related
to
a
price
fixing
scheme.
they
were
not
asked
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
non-price
restrictions
were
part
of
a
stabilization
plan,
which
the
jury
also
found
in
our
favor.
so
the
jury
found
everything
in
our
favor,
because
they
couldn't
have
done
anything
else
after
listening
to
mr.
mccormick's
testimony.
he
repeatedly
told
people
that
he
was
out
to
stabilize
the
market,
and
he
did.
it
says
that
he
got
agreements
from
people
to
do
it,
and
those
who
wouldn't
go
along
with
him,
he
threatened
termination
or
cancellation.
a
classic
case.
we
would
have
to
reverse
sealy
if
that
doesn't
constitute
sufficient
evidence.
i
think
the
case
is
stronger
than
sealy
on
the
facts.
i
think
the
case
is
stronger
than
general
motors
on
the
facts.
and
i
think
a
review
of
the
record,
which,
of
course,
this
court
doesn't
want
me
to
do,
will
support
that.
i
only
get
into
it
in
response
to
an
opening
argument
which
is
a
statement
of
facts
that
the
jury
rejected.
lasso
ended
up
with
a
14
percent
margin
after
the
price
stabilization
plan
was
put
into
effect.
before
that,
mr.
yapp,
my
client,
sold
at
a
6
percent
margin.
most...
when
mr.
yapp
was
competing
in
this
area,
the
farmers
got
the
difference
between
6
and
7
percent
and
14
percent.
that's
what
the
jury
had
a
right
to
conclude.
further,
that
other
companies
that
manufacture
herbicides
operated
on
a
14
percent
margin.
that's
in
the
appendix.
so
the
notion
that
there
wasn't
an
effect
on
the
market
only
can
be
arrived
at
by
rejecting
our
evidence
and
accepting
inferences
from
monsanto,
which
obviously
a
point
i'm
not
going
to
debate.
i
think
monsanto's
counsel
would
agree
that
i
have
the
right
to
have
the
evidence
construed
most
favorably
to
our
side.
let
me
address
a
confusing
point:
the
mere
allegation
point.
it
is
true
that
judge
power,
after
talking
about
the
allegations
in
sealy
and
the
allegations
in
sylvania,
says
that
mere...
uses
the
expression
"mere
allegation".
sealy
applies,
rather
than
continental,
if
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
territorial
restrictions
are
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices.
it
is
seriously
contended
that
this
court
ought
to
censure
judge
bower
by
his
expression
of
allegation.
in
the
petition
filed
in
this
court
by
the
united
states,
they
suggested
in
a
footnote
that
it
probably
out
to
say
"proof"
instead
of
"allegation".
well,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
a
red
herring.
what
in
the
world...
in
reading
page
1237
of
684
fed
second,
you've
got
to
conclude
that
judge
bower,
who
is
a
former
united
states
attorney,
a
district
court
judge,
and
a
court
of
appeals
judge
for
many
years,
doesn't
want
the
world
to
believe
that
he
thinks
that
all
you
have
to
do
in
a
case
is
make
allegations.
that's
the
thrust
of
what
they
would
like...
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
asked
this
court
to
take
the
case.
i
believe
that
that's
the
reason
the
court
took
the
case;
that
it
should
follow
practice
it
has
done
in
other
instances
and
dismiss
the
rest.
that
is
not
a
serious
point
for
this
court
to
review,
i
respectfully
suggest.
what
is
the
point,
then,
this
court
should
review?
it's
not
the
jury
instructions.
mr.
baxter
was
not
there
in
january
of
1980
to
put
his
particular
form
of
law
to
the
jury.
i
don't
know
what
the
jury
would
have
done
with
it.
i
don't
know
whether
the
district
court
would
have
accepted
his
new
principle.
but
we
know
one
thing.
nobody
argued
it.
mr.
bartlit
didn't
argue
it.
i
didn't
argue
it.
earl
jinkinson
didn't
argue
it.
because
it
wasn't
given,
it
wasn't
offered.
wasn't
the
predicate
of
this
court's
case,
sylvania
case,
when
justice
powell
said
there
was
an
instruction
at
the
trial
judge
for
a
rule
of
reason
which
the
trial
judge
rejected.
that's
how
the
case
came
up.
that's
totally
absent
in
this
case.
so
what's...
if
we
don't
have
jury
instructions
to
argue
about,
if
we
don't
have
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
argue
about,
if
we
are
not
going
to
take
seriously
the
notion
of
mere
allegation,
meaning
by
that
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit,
speaking
through
judge
bower,
actually
believes
you
don't
have
to
allege
anything...
i
mean
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything
but
only
allege
things,
then
what
is
this
case
all
about?
why
are
we
here?
mr.
edward
l.
foote
the
evidence
that
showed
the
agreement
or
conspiracy
starts
with
substantial
complaints.
it's
a
series
of
five
or
six
events.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
oh,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
substantially
more.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
it
started
historically
with
distributor
complaints,
some
of
whom
requested
that
we
do
something
about
this.
this
went
on
through
'66
and
'67.
during
that
time
monsanto
didn't
have
to
do
anything
with
those
complaints,
as
other
courts
of
appeals
have
reviewed
cases
where
they
did
nothing
except
label--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
--monsanto
reacted
to
those
complaints,
went
about
to
stabilize
prices
by
either
telling
dealers
such
as
yapp
that
they
should
increase
their
suggested...
increase
their
prices
to
the
suggested
price
that
the
other
dealers
wanted,
or
they'd
terminate
them.
and
they
did
terminate
those,
my
client
and
mr.
mulvahill.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
that
is
plain
nonsense,
i
respectfully
suggest,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
edward
l.
foote
after
that
they
had
a...
they
adopted
a
wholesale
stabilization
plan
for
the
entire
product
lasso.
lasso
was
a
new
product.
it
was
the
future
of
the
company.
its
success...
it
was
very
successful,
justice
o'connor.
it
became...
in
fact,
they
said
in
their
books
this
is
part
of
the
evidence;
that...
that
it
was
almost...
it
dominated
a
certain
kind
of
herbicide.
in
effect,
it
had
no
substitutes.
so
lasso
becomes
the
product
they're
trying
to
protect.
starting
in
the
summer
of
1968,
their
people
went
out
for
two
years
and
admitted
in
front
of
the
jury
that
they
stabilized
the
price
of
lasso.
they
said
we
went
around
to
all
the
distributors,
got
them
all,
the
word
was
signed
up.
if
they
weren't
"signed
up",
they
then
threatened
them,
either--
mr.
edward
l.
foote
--it
was
announced
almost
at
the
same
time.
our
position
was
that
it
was...
that
the
termination
of
our
person
was
necessary
because
our
client
was
a
price
cutter
who
they
feared.
they
have
testified
repeatedly
they
did
not
want
him
to
get
any
lasso
product.
in
addition
to
that,
after
they
terminated
him
and
wouldn't
get
any
product
from
him
directly,
we
couldn't
get
the
product
from
monsanto
directly,
they
went
around
and
boycotted
other
dealers
so
they
wouldn't
sell
to
us.
and
the
testimony
on
that,
justice,
was
very
explicit.
they
extracted
concessions
from
people
who
were
going
to
sell
to
us
not
to
sell
to
us.
