mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
mr.
chief
justice
and,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
district
court
here
imposed
mandatory
time
limits
on
the
processing
of
social
security
disability
claims,
title
ii
claims,
in
the
state
of
vermont.
that
order
was
based
on
a
finding
that
the
secretary
had
violated
the
social
security
act
because,
in
the
district
court's
view,
disability
claims
were
not
being
decided
quickly
enough.
the
statute
in
question,
which
is
section
205(b)
of
the
social
security
act,
requires
that
claimants
be
given,
and
i
quote,
"reasonable
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing.
"
the
statute
does
not
contain
any
mandation
of
time
limits
nor
does
it
refer
to
timeliness
as
a
requirement.
the
issue
here
then
is
what
did
congress
require
by
this
broad
statutory
mandate?
and,
in
turn,
since
the
secretary,
under
section
205(a),
has
full
power
to
issue
rules,
regulations,
and
procedures
to
carry
out
the
social
security
act.
the
further
issue
is
whether
the
secretary
acted
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
in
not
promulgating
mandatory
time
limits.
we
urge
that
the
critical
point
here
is
this:
both
congress
and
the
secretary
looked
long
and
hard
at
whether
mandatory
time
limits
should
be
imposed.
both
concluded
that
mandatory
time
limits
would
tend
to
undermine
the
effective
operation
of
the
social
security
disability
system.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
yes,
we
do,
justice
blackmun.
in
that
context,
we
urge
that
it
was
totally
inappropriate
for
the
district
court
to
overrule
the
policy
choice
made
by
congress
and
the
secretary.
the
social
security
disability
system
is
a
very
complex
management
problem
and
there
are
three
reasons
for
this.
one
is
that
the
number
of
claims
has
been
rapidly
expanding.
there
were
more
than
two
million
disability
claims
last
year.
the
second
thing
is
that
many
of
these
claims
present
very
difficult
physical
and
mental
and
economic
issues,
especially
since
many
of
the
claimants
themselves
are
unable
to
present
their
claims
effectively
because
of
their
very
situation.
and,
third,
and
perhaps
most
troublesome
as
a
management
matter,
the
statute
gives
the
secretary
three
quite
conflicting
mandates.
one
is
to
pay
claimants
who
are
eligible
as
quickly
as
possible.
but,
secondly,
given
the
dollars
involved
in
the
program,
it
is
equally
important
that
claimants
not
entitled
to
benefits
not
be
paid.
and,
finally,
the
secretary
is
under
an
obligation
to
conduct
the
program
as
fairly
and
accurately
and
uniformly
as
possible.
over
the
last
ten
years,
congress
and
the
secretary
have
wrestled
with
how
best
to
manage
the
program
given
these
conflicting
concerns.
each
of
them
has
considered
on
a
number
of
occasions
the
imposition
of
mandatory
time
limits
and
each
has
decided
against
such
imposition,
even
though
they
recognized
that
that
would
undoubtedly
result
in
faster
decisions
in
many
cases,
they
also
recognized
that
it
almost
certainly
would
result
in
many
more
wrong
ones.
first,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
what
congress
did.
for
one
thing,
congress,
on
a
number
of
occasions,
has
amended
the
social
security
act
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
any
intent
to
impose
mandatory
time
limits,
and
i
want
to
mention
just
two
instances.
one
is
that
when
it
established
the
supplemental
security
income
program,
the
ssi
program,
which
is
part
of
the
social
security
system,
it
had
put
into
the
statute
the
same
reasonable
notice
and
opportunity
for
a
hearing
requirement.
in
addition,
however,
in
that
case,
it
put
in
a
90-day
requirement
for
alj
hearings,
but
most
interestingly,
it
exempted
from
that
requirement
disability
cases.
it
is
our
position
that
the
inclusion
of
a
90-day
requirement
as
to
the
ssi
program,
but
the
exemption
from
that
of
disability
claims
is
clear
indication
that
when
congress
intended
to
impose
time
limits,
it
knew
how
to
do
so
and
did
do
so--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--it
has
done
something
about
interim
payments
in
connection
with
the
title
ii
program.
several
years
ago
it
imposed
interim
payments
where
a
claimant's
disability
payments
are
being
discontinued.
it
imposed
such
interim
payments
at
the
reconsideration
stage
and
it
is
our
position
that
congress'
imposition
of
interim
benefits
for
that
narrow
class
of
disability
claims,
title
ii
claims,
is
a
further
indication
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
broad
kind
of
interim
relief
imposed
by
the
district
court.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
that
interim
program
actually
expires,
i
believe,
at
the
end
of
this
month,
but
starting
next
year
some
new
rules
apply
at
the
reconsideration
stage
including
hearings,
de
novo
type
hearings
that
were
not
required
prior
to
this
time.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
we
would
probably
not
be
here
in
this
sense,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
case
may
not
have
been
cert
worthy
and
we
may
not
have
petitioned
for
cert.
but--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--we
believe
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
is
possible
that
you
could
have
an
extreme
case
where
a
claimant
could
prove
that
the
social
security
administrator
had
simply
put
that
case
on
the
back
burner,
refused
to
act
on
it,
and
mandamus
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
no,
justice
o'connor,
not
in
so
many
terms.
we
believe
that
the
secretary
has
a
broad
obligation
to
run
the
program
as
expeditiously
as
possible,
but
that
that
obligation
also...
that
overlaying
that
operation--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--it
does
on
an
overall
basis.
the
secretary
is
required,
we
believe
and
we
concede,
on
an
overall
basis
to
try
to
conduct
hearings
as
rapidly
as
possible.
the
problem
is,
as
congress--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--in
vermont,
it
really--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
district
court
findings
of
fact
on...
let's
take
administrative
law
judge
claims,
hearings,
all
the
court
found
was
that
in
approximately
47
percent
cases
were
not
decided
within
90
days.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
at
the
alj
stage,
the
court
did
not
rely
on
any
errors.
it
just
relied
on
the
percentage
of
cases
that
took
more
than
90
days.
and,
the
problem
is,
as
congress
has
noted
over
and
over
again,
many
cases
simply
take
a
longer
period
of
time
to
develop
the
facts.
in
many
cases,
perhaps
the
claimant
has
not
really
been
able
to
make
out
a
claim,
but
as
justice
brennan
noted
last
year
in
the
campbell
decision,
the
agency
still
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
develop
the
facts
itself
to
see
whether
there
is
a
valid
claim.
many
times
that
involves
additional
medical
or
vocational
or
other
information.
in
day's
case
itself,
he
had
not
made
out
a
claim.
it
was
only
after
a
quality
review
proceeding
with
the
social
security
administration
that
additional
neurological
tests
were
ordered
which
eventually
resulted
in
his
being
able
to
establish
a
claim.
that
is
the
point.
as
congress
most
recently
noted
in
1982
in
the
hearing...
in
the
congressional
report
that
accompanied
one
of
the
bills
that
eventually
was
enacted
in
'82,
in
many
cases,
take
a
longer
period
of
time.
and
the
problem
with
mandatory
time
limits
is
that
they,
by
their
very
nature,
are
arbitrary
and
do
not
permit
the
additional
work
in
cases
where
that
work
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
but,
the
problem
with
the
court's
order
is
this:
it
does
not
recognize
the
dynamics
of
the
situation.
for
example,
the
court
ordered
that
alj
hearings
be
held
within
90
days.
this
did
not
take
into
account
that
many
times
the
administrative
law
judge
would
want
additional
medical
or
vocational
information.
he
can't
conduct
the
exams
himself.
he
needs
the
help
of
others
and
frequently
that
takes
time.
it
did
not
take
into
account
that
many
times
the
facts
are
difficult
to
come
by
and
they
are
not
acquired
within
90
days.
it
did
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
facts
change.
we
are
talking
about
disability,
on-going
disability
situations
where
the
important
thing
is
what
are
the
facts
at
the
time.
and,
many
times
at
the
administrative
law
judge
stage
those
facts
have
changed
and
that
may
not
be
apparent
until
before
the
hearing.
what
the
court
did
is
that
court
said,
well,
yes,
if
it
has
been
the
fault
of
the
claimant,
then
the
90-day
period
does
not
bar
the
secretary.
the
problem
with
that
is
there
are
a
whole
host
of
other
factors
that
could
cause
a
delay
and
the
court
did
not
take
those
into
account.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
yes,
it
is.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
the
hearing
at
the...
what
happens
at
the
state
level
stage
is
not
as
full...
is
not
as
full
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
it
is
at
the
alj
stage.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
it
is
characterized
as
a
de
novo
hearing
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
de
novo
review
of
the
state's
original
finding,
yes.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
congress
has
considered
that
on
a
number
of
occasions
and,
indeed,
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
an
earlier
question,
has
actually
required
a
new,
so-called
face-to-face
hearing
at
the
reconsideration
stage,
particularly
in
the
case
of
claimants
whose
disability
benefits
are
being
withdrawn.
and,
i
believe
the
theory
was
that
as
to
those
cases
there
is
a
particular
concern
that
the
case
be
made
out
as
best
as
it
can
at
an
early
stage
so
that
a
claimant
can
be
kept
on
the
disability
system
where
he
or
she
has
come
to
rely
on
the
social
security.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
the
average
case
load
of
the
administrative
law
judges
is
over
200
cases
per
administrative
law
judge.
that
average
case
load
has
been
increasing
over
the
last
ten
years.
in
fact,
the
number
of
requested
hearings
has
gone
from
about
70,000
in
1974
to
about
350,000
this
year.
but,
during
that
period
of
time,
the
secretary
has
about
doubled
the
number
of
administrative
law
judges
from
about
400
to
about
800.
i
think
it
is
interesting
that
there
are
less
than
500
sitting
federal
district
court
judges
in
this
country
today.
there
are
almost
twice
as
many
administrative
law
judges
coping
with
this
load
of
cases.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
the
situation
in--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--the
average
caseloads
are
roughly
comparable
from
state
to
state
and
from
region
to
region.
we
have
lodged
with
the
court
the
workload
statistics
of
the
secretary.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
yes.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
the--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--justice
marshall,
i
would
not
characterize
the
present
situation
as
arbitrary
for
this
reason.
what
the
secretary
has
done
over
the
last
ten
years
in
the
face
of
the
tremendous
increase
in
claims
is
to
do
a
number
of
things
which
has
resulted
in
a
much
more
efficient
system.
despite
a
five-fold
increase
in
claim
today
claims
are
heard
as
quickly
as
they
were
ten
years
ago,
and,
indeed,
over
the
last
five
or
six
years,
the
average
processing
time
has
gone
down
substantially
and
this
hasn't
happened
by
accident.
it
has
happened
through
the
addition
of
new
judges.
it
has
happened
through
management
improvements,
through
computer
techniques,
systems,
goals,
and
putting
pressure
on
the
aljs
to
hear
cases
more
quickly.
and,
the
fact
is
ten
years
ago
the
average
alj
was
issuing
only
14
opinions
per
month.
by
last
year,
the
average
number
of
opinions
per
month
was
in
the
high
30s.
that
is
an
enormous
number
of
judicial
decisions
per
decider
of
cases
i
would
submit.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
the--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--i
think
if
it
were
20
years
it
would
be
considered
arbitrary.
but,
if
you--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--i
think
the
significant
thing--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--our
position
is
that
the
statute
was
not
violated.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
but,
the
problem
is
that
in
looking
at
whether
the
statute
was
violated,
you
can't
really
separate
that
from
what
the
secretary
was
doing.
and,
in
our
view,
what
the
secretary
was
doing
was
appropriate
because
the
secretary
has
broad
discretion
under
this
statute
to
decide
how
to
manage
it
and
obviously
whether
to
impose
mandatory
time
limits--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--no.
what
we
would
say
is
this.
it
may
be
that
in
an
individual
case,
an
individual
claimant,
because
of
the
way
he
or
she
was
treated
by
the
agency,
might
be
able
to
make
out
a
claim
that
his
or
her
rights
were
violated
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
what
happened
here
was
the
findings
of
the
court
was
on
a
broad
class
basis.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
by
the
time
the
district
court
issued
the
order
here,
the
claims
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
had
been
taken
care
of.
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
that
it
was
a
class-wide
order
in
which
the
judge
made
a
decision
based
on
the
whole
operation
of
the
statute
in
vermont.
and,
what
the
court
was
addressing
was
not
whether
individual
claimant
"a"
has
not
gotten
relief
from
the
agency.
two
hundred
and
fifty
days
has
gone
by
and
you
can
see
under
the
facts
of
that
case
that
that
was
unreasonable
because
no
additional
medical
evidence
was
needed,
no
additional
vocational
evidence
was
needed,
and
there
was
no
excuse.
that
wasn't
what
the
district
court
did.
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
look
at
the
length
of
time
that
alj
hearings
were
taking,
found
that
in
roughly
40
some
percent
of
the
cases
they
were
taking
more
than
90
days
and
from
that
fact
alone
issued
relief.
at
the
reconsideration
stage,
the
court
looked
at
some
docket
entries
type
information
about
70
some
odd
cases,
concluded
that
the
docket
entries
did
not
explain
why
there
were
periods
of
time
between
different
events
and
also
noted
that
roughly
40
percent
of
cases
took
more
than
90
days
and
concluded
from
those
facts
alone
that
the
statute
was
violated
and
that
mandatory
time
limits
were
necessary.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
there
is
no
statutory--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--well,
that
is
our
view;
that
as
to
the
40...
the
statute
is
not
violated
and
that
that
is
the
clear--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--the
appropriate
remedy
would
depend
on--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--the
appropriate
thing
here
would
be
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
issue
the
kind
of
management
order
that
it
did--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--the
appropriate
relief
in
our
view
would
be
to
consider
cases
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
there
should
be
no
class-wide
relief.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
even
if
there
were
a
class-wide
violation
which
obviously
we
don't
concede.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
raised
in
the
complaint
here.
it
was
not
a
basis
of
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
it
does.
and,
our
position
on
that
is
basically
this,
that
the
reasonableness
requirement
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
essentially,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
no
different
from
the
reasonableness
requirement
in
the
social
security
act;
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
talks
about
reasonable
times
given
the
status
of
the
parties
and
that
really
you
have
to
look
at
the
same--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--typically,
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
individual
remedy
is
either
an
order
to
the
agency
to
proceed
more
quickly
or,
if
the
individual
actually
has
been
found
to
be
eligible,
an
order
requiring
whatever
the
benefits
are.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
their
cases
have
long
since
been
dealt
with.
the
only
live
issue
here
is
as
to
the
class,
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
although
the
government
has
argued
in
a
number
of
these
cases
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
case
was
moot
or
raised
mootness
issues,
the
courts
have
held
the
case
is
not
moot
for
this
reason.
at
the
time
the
class
was
certified,
the
claims
of
the
class
plaintiffs
were
still
live
and
it
was
held,
since
basically
what
is
being
decided
here
is
not
the
merits
of
individual
claims,
but
rather
the
ancillary
question
of
how
those
claims
should
be
dealt
with
as
a
procedural
matter,
that
it
was
appropriate
under
various
decisions
of
this
court
for
the
court
to
consider
the
case.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
and,
that
is
the
reason
why
the
government
below
did
argue
that
the
case
was
moot.
we
do
not
raise
that
here
because
of
the
findings
of--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--well,
the
on-going
part
of
this
case
is
that...
is
solely
as
to
class
members
who
in
the
future
will
be
able
to
say
i
did
not
have
my
claim
processed
within
90
days.
the
issue
is
whether
they
receive
interim
benefits
or
not.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
of
course,
this
order
now
has
been
in
effect
for
several
years
and
what
has
been
happening
is
that
on
a
few
occasions
where
the
processing
went
beyond
90
days
interim
benefits
were
permitted.
so
that
it
is
now
kind
of
an
on-going
thing.
there
is
probably
nobody
whose
claim
is
now
being
considered
in
vermont
where
it
was
the
same
claim
that
was
pending
back
when
the
district
court
was
considering
this
claim.
there
may
be
some
of
the
same
individuals
because
claims
can
be
denied,
disabilities
can
disappear.
but,
as
an
on-going
matter,
none
of
the
people
who
are
now
affected
by
the
order,
at
least
none
of
the
claims
now
affected
by
the
order
were
live
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
the
government
did
oppose
that.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
that
was
the
blankenship
case.
at
the
same
time
as
the
court
there
ordered
that
the
government
impose
mandatory
time
limits
in
regulations,
virtually
the
same
month,
congress,
by
statute,
required
the
secretary
to
submit
a
report
as
to
what
time
limits
might
be
appropriate
and
ordered
the
secretary
to
take
into
account
such
considerations
as
timeliness
on
the
one
hand
and
the
need
to
consider
claims
thoroughly
on
the
other
hand.
the
secretary,
at
the
same
time
as
he
was
considering
what
to
submit
to
congress,
was
considering
what
to
do
in
the
blankenship
case,
the
sixth
circuit
case.
the
secretary
concluded
in
both
instances
to
urge
that
time
limits
were
not
appropriate,
because
after
the
extensive
rule-making
process
that
had
concluded,
the
secretary
concluded
that
the
imposition
of
mandatory
time
limits
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
effective
operation
of
the
statute,
submitted
that
report
to
congress.
congress,
in
1982,
did
not
adopt
mandatory
time
limits.
instead,
it
is
clear
from
the
committee
reports
that
accompanied
other
legislation
which
congress
did
adopt
that
congress
concluded
that
mandatory
time
limits
would
be
inappropriate
because...
and
the
main
thing
they
emphasized
is
that
individual
cases
may
vary
greatly
and
that
in
many
cases
you
do
need
additional
information
and
mandatory
time
limits
are
arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
the
tend
to
ignore
that
consideration.
the
congressional
reports
also
indicated,
and
this,
i
think,
is
perhaps
even
more
important,
that
mandatory
time
limits
can
result
in
more
incorrect
determinations.
and,
the
problem
with
incorrect
determinations
is
not
just
that
people
will
be
paid
that
shouldn't
be
paid.
the
perhaps
greater
problem
is
that
people
won't
be
paid
who
should
be
paid
and
that
creates
a
severe
problem,
because
in
these
cases
many
of
the
claimants
really
are
not
capable
of
effectively
presenting
their
claims.
most
of
them,
the
vast
bulk
of
them,
are
not
represented
by
counsel
and
the
burden,
however,
is
on
them
to
establish
their
claim.
and,
if
they
can't
do
it,
the
claim
is
denied.
if
an
arbitrary
time
limit
is
imposed
and
at
that
point
the
secretary
has
to
act,
the
claim
will
get
denied
and
then
the
problem
is
they
have
to
go
to
court
and
even
though
they
may
get
a
reversal
in
court,
the
statistics
show
that
the
federal
courts
today
are
taking
two
to
three
times
as
long
as
the
secretary
is
at
the
alj
stage
to
hear
these
cases.
so
that
imposing
mandatory
time
limits...
i
think
the
biggest
problem
with
the
district
court's
order
is
that
it
may,
in
fact,
result
in
many
claims
being
denied
that
should
have
been
granted
and
then
many
of
those
claimants
going
to
court
and
even
if
they
win
in
court,
it
will
have
taken
a
much
longer
time
for
them
to
receive
benefits.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
i
would
say
leave
it
to
mandamus
in
individual
cases
because
here
both
congress
and
the
secretary
have
looked
at
this
question
so
carefully.
so
many
administrative
improvements
have
been
made
under
the
statute.
there
are
serious
problems
with
the
kind
of
order
issued
by
the
district
court
and
since,
under
those
circumstances,
i
do
not
believe
it
could
be
held
that
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
impose
mandatory
time
limits
was
arbitrary.
since
the
secretary
has
such
broad
statutory
responsibilities
under
the
statute,
we
urge
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
dismissed.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
i
cannot--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--i
do
not
offhand
know
of
another
situation.
we
are
not
saying
here
that
there
would
be
no
conceivable
factual
situation
here
in
which
a
class-wide
order
would
have
been
appropriate.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
given
the
history,
the
close
congressional
consideration,
the
careful
scrutiny
by
the
secretary,
and
the
fact
that
the
secretary
over
the
years
has
done
a
wide
variety
of
things
to
make
this
whole
process
more
efficient,
that
in
this
context
class-wide
relief
is
inappropriate
because
the
court
was
wrong
in
deciding
that
the
act
was
violated.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe...
i
wanted
to
make
one
principal
point.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
the
question
here
is
what
did
congress
intend?
and,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
last
few
years,
you
cannot
come
away
with
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
mandatory
time
limits.
to
the
contrary,
i
think
you--
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
--it
is
another
question
except
that
i
think
the
congressional
record
answers
that
question
also,
justice
white,
because
congress
over
and
over
again
said
in
their
reports,
things
like
the
report
we
quoted
at
pages
29
to
30
of
our
brief
which
was
that
they
were
very
concerned
that
mandatory
time
limits
would
ignore
the
fact
that
social
security
disability
cases
tend
to
vary
greatly
from
case
to
case.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
the
congress
was
very
concerned
about
mandatory
time
limits
and
i
think
that
indicates
what
congress
meant
by
the
reasonableness
requirement
under
the
statute
and
whether
a
court
could
read
into
the
statute
more
of
a
requirement
of
expedition
than
congress
intended
to
put
there.
that
is
not
to
say,
however,
that
the
secretary,
in
her
discretion,
could
not
conclude
that
time
limits
of
some
sort
were
appropriate,
perhaps
different
time
limits
for
different
parts
of
the
country.
the
secretary,
however,
independently,
operating
under
the
authority
in
section
205(a)
of
the
statute,
concluded
that
such
time
limits
were
not
appropriate.
and,
what
we
have
here,
however,
is
the
worst
of
all
possible
worlds.
we
have
different
courts
issuing
different
kinds
of
orders,
different
time
limits,
different
requirements.
as
we
have
shown
in
our
reply
brief,
this
has
required
in
some
states
the
allocation
of
resources
from
other
states.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
absolutely.
the
secretary
has
been
able
to
comply
with
the
time
limits,
probably
would
be
able
to
comply
with
any
time
limits,
because
all
the
secretary
has
to
do
at
the
reconsideration
stage
is
make
a
decision.
decisions
would
be
made.
there
will
just
be
many
more
wrong
decisions
and
that
really
is
a
part
of
our
point.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
we
cannot,
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
in
vermont,
state
a
factual
conclusion
one
way
or
another
as
to
that.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
well,
we
assume
it
for
this
reason.
mr.
j.
paul
mc
grath
many
of
them
are
not.
in
fact,
of
the
two
million
claims
a
year,
the
vast
bulk
of
them
are
decided
even
before
they
get
to
the
reconsideration
stage.
it
is
only
a
declining
fraction
of
cases
that
take
more
than
the
mean
68
days
that,
indeed,
was
the
experience
in
vermont.
and,
the
reason
we
conclude
as
to
those
case
there
is
a
problem
is
that
based
both
on
the
lengthy
hearings
and
reports
in
congress
and
on
the
findings
of
the
secretary
based
on
all
of
past
secretaries'
experiences,
they
concluded
that
there
was
a
problem
with
mandatory
time
limits,
which
problem
is
essentially
that
it
would
undercut
the
overall
goal
of
thoroughness
and
accuracy.
and
that
really
is
the
record
basis
that
we
rely
on.
thank
you
very
much.
