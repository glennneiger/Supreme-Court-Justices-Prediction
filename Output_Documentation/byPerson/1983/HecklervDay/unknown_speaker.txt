unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
mcgrath,
you
acknowledge
that
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
issues
regulations
imposing
such
effort.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgrath,
in
that
connection
did
congress
do
something
about
interim
payments?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
present
status
legislatively
of
that
interim
program?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgrath,
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
had
granted
relief
only
to
the
individual
plaintiff,
mr.
day,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
would
the
court
have
had
the
power
and
authority
in
your
view
to
order
relief
for
an
individual
plaintiff
in
the
nature
of
saying
you
have
to
complete
your
work
within
"x"
number
of
days
and,
furthermore,
you
can
have
interim
relief?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
section
405(b)
gives
a
claimant
a
right
to
a
hearing
within
a
reasonable
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
impose
an
obligation
of
any
kind
on
the
secretary
to
grant
an
administrative
law
judge
hearing
within
a
reasonable
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
rapid
is
that
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
in
the
face
of
the
district
court
findings
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
also
found
that
in
vermont
there
were
enough
administrative
law
judges
to
go
around
and
the
case
load
was
pretty
small
and,
therefore,
it
was
easily
handled
within
a
90-day
interval,
particularly
because
the
errors
that
it
found
were
simply
errors
of
judgment,
if
you
will.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
court
tried
to
fashion
various
exceptions
to
its
order
to
cover
most
of
those
situations.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgrath,
is
the
hearing
de
novo
at
the
administrative
law
judge
stage?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
is
the
second
de
novo
hearing
the
claimant
has
had?
unknown
speaker
it
is
characterized
as
a
de
novo
hearing.
unknown
speaker
has
congress
ever
considered
whether
it
is
really
necessary
to
have,
first
of
all,
that
many
hearings
and,
secondly,
two
de
novo
hearings?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
average
case
load
of
the
administrative
law
judges?
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
overload
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
does
the
average
law
judge
in
vermont
have
200
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
put
it
another
way.
you
characterize
the
90-day
rule
as
being
arbitrary,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
characterize
the
present
rule
which,
as
i
understand
it,
allows
the
law
judge
to
take
the
rest
of
his
life
on
a
case.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
characterize
that
as
to
whether
it
is
arbitrary
or
not?
unknown
speaker
could
it
go
high
enough
that
it
would
take
20
years?
unknown
speaker
and,
if
so,
would
that
be
considered
arbitrary?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
going
to
ask
you
what
you
would
consider.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
government's
theory,
because
i
must
confess
i
think...
i
tend
to
confuse
two
issues
as
i
read...
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
statute
was
violated.
secondly,
assuming
there
was
a
violation,
was
the
remedy
appropriate?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
we
reach
the
second
question,
we
even
reach
mandatory
time
limits
unless
we
decide
the
statue
was
violated.
what
is
your
position
on
whether
the
statue
was
violated?
unknown
speaker
then
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
mandatory
time
limits,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
you
are
saying...
i
guess
your
position
then
is
even
if
it
takes
200
or
250
days
to
dispose
of
a
case,
that
is
not
a
statutory
violation.
judges
are
busy.
we
take
a
long
time
some
times.
unknown
speaker
but,
none
of
these
plaintiffs
did.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and,
your
view
is
that
even
as
to
those
40
percent
there
is
no
statutory
violation.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
true,
we
don't
really
have
to
address
all
this
other
stuff.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
concluded
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
violation?
then
what
would
the
appropriate
remedy
be?
unknown
speaker
could
there
be
class-wide
relief?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
you
object
to
this
remedy.
i
am
asking
you,
if
we
concluded
there
was
a
violation,
what
would
the
appropriate
relief
be
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
there
should
be
no
class-wide
relief.
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
is
a
class-wide
violation?
unknown
speaker
is
the
administrative
procedure
act
relevant
here
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
be,
but
that
has
some
reasonable
requirements,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
remedies
have
been
issued
in
individual
cases
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
do
you
know
of
any?
unknown
speaker
are
there...
did
you
say
the
plaintiffs
have
been
paid
or
are
their
cases
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
to
the
class,
but
is
there
any
problem
of
mootness?
unknown
speaker
that
is
quite
contrary
to
that
jacobs
versus
indianapolis
case
that
we
decided
in
'74
or
'75.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
jurisdictional
case.
no
party
has
to
raise
it.
it
is
here
if
there
is
any
substantial
claim
of
it
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and,
they
have
not
presently
been
denied
anything.
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
the
situation
of
what
remedy
the
court
could
impose
in
a
class
action
situation,
if
it
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
the
delays
were
unreasonable,
in
the
sixth
circuit,
i
think
it
was,
the
court
there,
as
a
matter
of
relief,
said,
well,
we
won't
impose
arbitrary
timeliness,
we
will
just
order
that
the
secretary
develop
some
reasonable
time
limits
to
take
care
of
these
cases
and
the
government
opposed
that
as
well,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now
why?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
just
leave
this
whole
question
to
mandamus?
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
other
examples
where
we
may
have
held
that
class
action
relief
simply
isn't
possible
and
that
we
have
to
order
individual
claimants
to
resort
to
mandamus?
unknown
speaker
because
the
court
has
no
inherent
power
or
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
grant
any
class
action.
unknown
speaker
how
significant
do
you
think
it
is,
mr.
munzing,
that
congress
addressed
this
problem
on
a
number
of
occasions
and
decided
that
arbitrary
time
limits
were
not
feasible?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
one
remedy
that
congress
didn't
impose
in
the
disability
field
was
a
flat
time
limit.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing,
in
fact,
the
system
of
processing
disabilities
is
running
pretty
much
the
same
all
through
the
country;
that
the
delays
in
vermont
are
no
different
than
anywhere
else,
then
i
suppose
the
people
who
go
to
court
in
vermont
and
perhaps
people
who
go
to
court
in
oregon
are
going
to
get
this
kind
of
relief,
the
people
who
don't
go
to
court
in
other
states
are
going
be
left
off
the
band
wagon.
unknown
speaker
but,
the
fact
that
the
secretary
set
the
goals
that
are
not,
in
fact,
conformed
to
by
the
aljs
doesn't
make
that
kind
of
objective
factor,
at
least
so
far
as
i
can
see,
automatically
translate
into
mandatory
time
limits.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
found
the
secretary
wasn't
complying
with
a
goal.
really
the
court
found
the
secretary
wasn't
meeting
the
goals.
i
mean,
there
wasn't
an
arbitrary
or
kind
of
willful
failure
to
comply,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
munzing,
my
problem
is
that
the
90-day
limit
applies
equally
to
the
sparsely
populated
district
of
alaska
and
a
rather
heavy
populated
southern
district
of
new
york.
they
are
a
little
different.
unknown
speaker
they
can
do
that
now
if
we
uphold
the
order
in
this
case?
can
the
district
judge
in
alaska
say
i
will
give
you
91
days?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
so,
this
order
does
not
have
nationwide
repercussions?
unknown
speaker
you
don't?
okay.
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
that
might
shed
some
light
or
might
not.
you
are
familiar
with
the
speedy
trial
act
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
relation
to
criminal
prosecution
in
recent
years?
you
are
generally
familiar
that
congress
did
that?
suppose
a
district
judge,
becoming
impatient
with
cases
not
being
brought
to
trial
and
disposed
of
rapidly
entered
an
order,
all
criminal
cases
must
be
brought
to
trial
within
90
days.
in
other
words,
entered
an
order
that
essentially
what
the
speedy
trial
act
is
now
and
said
any
indictment
not
pursued
with
trial
in
that
90-day
period
would
be
dismissed.
does
the
district
judge
have
the
power
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
go
to
the
question
of
the
power
and
authority
of
the
court.
it
may
be
a
very
good
thing.
my
question
is
addressed
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
court
had
the
power
to
establish
time
limits
which
congress
expressly
rejected.
unknown
speaker
mr.
munzing,
mr.
mcgrath
has
told
us
that
these
arbitrary
time
limits
are
going
to
cause
claims
to
be
denied
that
are
meritorious.
there
is
not
enough
time
to
process
them
properly.
has
that
been
demonstrated?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
just
made
it
up
out
of
the
blue
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
at
least
there
is
no
record
support
for
it,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
and,
we
have
had
how
much
experience,
about
three
years'
experience?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
mean,
what
is
the
evidence
on
his
suggestion
that
when
they
are
hard
pressed
the
aljs
will
simply
deny
meritorious
claims?
unknown
speaker
as
i
look
at
the
record,
the
case
of
the
case
of
leon
day,
the
particular
case,
would
appear
to
be
the
sixth
time
the
matter
was
considered
when
the
district
court
acted
finally.
now,
can
that
be
correct?
unknown
speaker
but,
very
many
of
the
people
in
mr.
day's
situation
take
six
hearings.
that
probably
has
some
bearing
on
the
fact
that
these
hearings
take
more
than
90
days.
unknown
speaker
if
everybody
in
vermont
who
has
got
a
claim
gets
six
shots
at
this
target,
i
can
understand
why
they
have
a
lot
of
delay
up
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
munzing,
could
the
district
court
have
certified
a
national
class?
would
it
have
had
authority
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
as
a
matter
of
power,
would
the
district
court
have
had
the
authority
to
certify
a
national
class?
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
this
case
before
the
district
court?
when
did
you
file
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
two
years?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
judge
think
that
was
unduly
long?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
new
administrative
law
judge
would
have
a
similar
problem?
unknown
speaker
could
the
court
of
appeals
have,
in
its
judgment,
ordered
all
district
courts
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals,
to
decide
these
cases
in
90
days?
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
have
been
abuse
of
power?
unknown
speaker
impose
arbitrary
limitations
on
district
courts
with
respect
to
deciding
cases?
unknown
speaker
that
is
quite
different
from
the
question
i
asked
though,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
whether,
in
view
of
the
problems
of
delay
that
properly
concern
you,
and
i
don't
denigrate
the
importance
of
the
issue
at
all,
but
in
order
to
accelerate
the
process,
as
a
matter
of
power,
could
the
court
of
appeals
have
said
that
this
is
such
a
wholesome
order,
according
to
the
vermont
issue,
that
we
are
going
to
make
it
circuit
wide
applying
it
to
new
york,
vermont--
unknown
speaker
--so,
this
has
to
be
done
on
a
state-by-state
basis?
unknown
speaker
is
the
order...
is
the
report
that
the
court
ordered
to
be
filed
as
to
how
the
remedy
was
to
be
implemented,
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and,
has
that
report
ever
been
modified
at
all?
unknown
speaker
the
implementation
of
the
plan.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that
statement
that
she
had
the
capacity?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
in
the
record
any
explanation
as
to
why
those
goals,
those
90-days
goals
were
not
being
met
even
though
there
were
three
administrative
law
judges
that
the
secretary
apparently
thought
were
adequate?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
identify
any
reason,
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
munzing,
am
i
correct
that
all
the
order
requires
is
that
a
hearing
be
held?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be
decided
within
90
days.
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to
differentiate
plain
english?
that
is
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and,
what
is
the
limit
on
how
long
he
can
hold
it
sub
judice?
unknown
speaker
twenty
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
decides...
when
there
is
a
request
for
reconsideration,
who
decides
that
request?
unknown
speaker
those
are
not
aljs.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
are
two
parts
to
this
case,
i
take
it.
one
is
the
reconsideration
stage
and
the
other
is
the
hearing
stage,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
did
the
secretary
admit
or
represent
that
she
had
the
capacity
to
comply
with
the
court's
90-day
order
on
reconsideration?
unknown
speaker
then
i
understand
that
the
order
here
is
not
the
order
that
is
here.
unknown
speaker
then
why
isn't
it
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
we
have
got
to
go
to
the
record
to
look
for
them?
unknown
speaker
the
judgment
order
only
applies
to
the
hearing.
unknown
speaker
on
what
page?
0....
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
right,
i
will
find
it.
it
is
on
page
32a,
32a
of
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
32a
is
it?
i
notice
that
the
district
judge
took
three
years,
something
over
three
years
to
decide
this
case
himself.
i
suppose
we
can
assume
that
he
had
other
cases
to
decide
in
the
meantime
too.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
anything
about
other
cases,
what
the
number
of
cases
that
were
decided
in
a
way
that
you
would
regard
as
prompt
or
does
the
record
concentrate
just
on
the
cases
that
took
an
undue
length
of
time
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
remedy,
if
any,
that
was
issued
in
those
prior
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
like
the
white
case?
unknown
speaker
and,
how
about
the
other
one?
what
was
that,
barnett?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
was...
those
cases
purported
to
be
implementing
the
reasonable
time
requirement
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
now,
had
those
cases
been
decided
when
congress
was
amending
the
social
security
act?
unknown
speaker
i
see
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
these
cases,
and
when
they
turned
down
specific
time
limits,
they
were
aware
of
these
cases.
and,
hence,
congress
is
going
to
leave
it
to
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
you
are
as
entitled
to
be
as
treacherous
as
the
government.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
gather
interim
payments
apply
only
in
terminated
cases?
unknown
speaker
also
in
initial--
unknown
speaker
--when
one
initiates
a
claim
may
there
be
immediate
interim
payment?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
certainly
didn't
intend
themselves
impose
it,
but
it
is
another
question
of
whether
they
were
willing
to
put
up
with
what
the
courts
were
then
doing
to
implement
the
reasonableness
requirement.
unknown
speaker
in
answer
to
my
first
question
at
the
start
of
your
argument
you
conceded
that
the
secretary
had
the
ability
to
impose
mandatory
time
limits.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
tie
in
with
your
statement
just
now
that
congress
was
otherwise
inclined?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgrath,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
one
question?
has
your
opponent
fairly
characterized
the
experience
in
vermont
under
the
particular
order
we
are
reviewing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
submit
that
your
experience
during
the
last
three
years
supports
your
suggestion
that
there
have
been
a
lot
of
wrong
decisions
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
assume
they
would
make
wrong
decisions?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
got
the
time...
if
you
only
need
90
days
and
you
can
do
it
in
90
days,
why
won't
they
decide
these
things...
most
of
them
are
not
all
that
difficult.
