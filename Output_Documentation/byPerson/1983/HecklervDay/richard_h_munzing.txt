mr.
richard
h.
munzing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
record
and
results
of
this
case
show,
entrenched,
unnecessary
delays
do
not
need
to
be
apart
of
the
disability
insurance
appeal
system.
the
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
engaged
in
the
most
basic
of
judicial
functions.
as
counsel
for
the
secretary
admitted,
the
court
viewed
the
facts
of
the
case
and
determined
that
disability
insurance
claimants
in
vermont
were
routinely
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
reasonably
expeditious
administrative
appellate
action
that
the
secretary
is
mandated
to
provide,
together
with
other
statutory
goals,
by
205(b)
of
the
social
security
act.
as
a
consequence,
the
district
court,
pursuant
to
its
traditional,
flexible,
remedial,
equitable
powers
fashioned
a
balanced,
meaningful
remedy
that
compelled
expeditious
processing
that
was
within
the
secretary's
capacity,
that
did
not
cause
extra
cost
to
the
secretary,
and
that
did
not
harm
other
statutory
goals
such
as
quality
and
accuracy
in
decision
making.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
virtually
every
instance
where
congress
has
amended
the
social
security
act
in
recent
years
in
the
disability
programs,
in
ssi
and
in
disability
insurance,
virtually
the
primary
factor
prompting
congress'
interest
has
been
the
problem
of
lengthy,
unnecessary
delay.
virtually
every
action
congress
has
taken
has
been,
at
least
in
part,
in
the
hopes
of
getting
the
secretary
to
be
able
to
deal
with
and
eliminate
this
problem.
indeed,
on
many
occasions,
the
secretary
has
represented
to
congress
that
the
disability
delay
problem
is
well
in
hand
and
would
shortly
be
resolved.
so,
i
hardly
think
we
can
say
that
either
congress
has
not
been
interested
in
curing
the
delay
problem
or
that
congress
has
been
made
fully
aware
that
the
secretary
does
not
have
the
capacity
alone
to
deal
with
the
problem.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
we
don't
dispute
that,
justice
rehnquist,
but
what
the
court
did
here,
in
the
absence
of
fixed
time
limits,
but
with
the
mandate
to
provide
hearings
within
a
reasonable
time,
was
to
engage
in
a
fact-specific
analysis
of
the
circumstances
it
found
in
vermont.
as
this
court
noted
in
fusari
v.
steinberg,
the
connecticut
unemployment
delay
case
from
1975,
any
statutory
requirement
embodying
notions
of
timeliness,
accuracy,
and
administrative
feasibility
will
inevitably
generate
fact
specific
applications.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well,
that
is
where
the
fact...
specific
analysis,
the
analysis
of
the
factual
record
developed
before
it
by
the
district
court
lead
the
court
to
find
that
there
were
differences
in
vermont
from
elsewhere.
and,
indeed,
there
was
nothing
put
into
the
record
by
the
secretary
to
show
that
the
causes
of
delays
elsewhere
or
the
circumstances
of
delays
elsewhere...
what
the
court
found
in
vermont,
first
of
all,
was
that
the
secretary,
since
january
of
1978,
had
a
goal
of
processing
all
cases
within
90
days.
that
was
almost
a
year
before
this
case
was
even
filed.
the
record
also
showed
the
district
court
that
since
1977
the
secretary
was
processing
ssi
cases
and
title
ii
cases,
or
it
was
supposed
to
be
processing
them
within
this
90-day
goal.
in
other
words,
the
secretary
herself
provided
the
district
court
in
vermont
with
an
objective
criterion
against
which
the
plaintiffs'
allegations
of
unreasonable
delay
could
be
measured.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
but,
it
wasn't
just
the
fact
that
the
secretary,
through
these
goals,
supplied
the
court
with
this
objective
criterion
against
which
to
measure
unreasonableness.
the
court
also
found
in
the
factual
record
that
even
though
she
had
the
goals
she
was
not
complying
with
them
in
nearly
one
out
of
every
two
cases.
the
court
found
that
of
all
the
claimants
who
persevered
to
reach
the
fair
hearing
level,
fully
56
percent
of
them
turned
out
to
have
been
disabled
all
along.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
but,
the
interesting
thing
is
that
with
the
impetus
of
the
court's
remedial
order
the
secretary
discovered
a
capacity
to
achieve
the
goals
that
previously
she
had
articulated
but
had
not
been
able
to
achieve
without
having
to
move
additional
resources
into
vermont
from
elsewhere,
without
harm
to
claimants
elsewhere,
without
harm
to
other
statutory
goals
by
fashioning
a
flexible,
balanced,
effective,
injunctive
remedy.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
think...
they
are
a
little
different
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
to
address
these
problems
with
a
state-wide
class
a
district
court
judge
is
bound
to
analyze
the
specific
facts
within
that
district
to
ascertain
whether
the
general
reasonableness
requirement
is
violated.
we
maintain
that--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
think
in--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--yes.
i
think
inherent
in
the
notion
that
the
facts
determine
unreasonableness--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
your
honor,
i
guess
i
am
not
familiar
enough
with
the
speedy
trial
act
to...
i
suspect
the
answer
is
not,
but
i
think
that
situation
could
be
distinguished
from
what
happened
in
vermont.
for
one
thing,
the
90-day
time
frames
that
are
in
place
in
vermont
now
have
been
for
about
three
years
and
have
resulted
in
virtually
uniform
compliance.
there
has
been
one
violation
in
the
entire
three--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
think
if
congress
expressly
rejected
time
limits
and
the
court
imposed
them,
it
would
be
acting
inconsistent
with
congress.
but,
we
do
not...
we
maintain
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
failure
of
fixed
time
limits
to
exist
within
the
social
security
act
with
the
actions
of
the
court
below.
for
one
thing,
the
time
limits
are
not
written
in
stone.
they
were,
in
the
words
of
the
second
circuit,
crafted
with
an
eye
to
the
secretary's
concerns.
there
are
exceptions.
again,
from
the
factual
record,
the
district
court
learned
that
the
secretary's
major
concern
at
the
reconsideration
level
was
that
her
disability
determination
people
would
have
sufficient
time
to
be
able
to
develop
enough
medical
evidence
to
do
accurate
decisions.
at
the
hearing
level,
the
secretary's
major
concern,
as
articulated
to
the
district
court,
was
that
aljs
would
have
sufficient
time
to
be
able
to
deliberate
to
ensure
accurate
decisions
and,
if
necessary,
to
schedule
new
consultative
examinations
if
the
alj
perceived
that
new
evidence
needed
to
be
generated.
the
district
court
order
excepted
both
of
those
circumstances
from
the
time
frames,
thus
responding
directly
to
the
secretary's
concern
that
time
limits
might
have
some
adverse
impact
on
the
quality
of
decision
making.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
stevens.
the
exceptions
ensure,
in
fact,
that
that
exactly
does
not
occur.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
don't
find
any.
that
is
exactly
what...
that
concern
is
exactly
what
the
exceptions
are
designed
to
address
and,
in
fact,
that
is
exactly
what
they
do
address
in
practice.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
court's
preliminary
injunction
as
to
the
hearing
phase
delays
issued
in
december
of
1980
through
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
in
1983,
as
the
appendix
to
our
brief
indicates,
there
had
been
but
one
violation
in
that
two
and
a
quarter
year
period.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
order
merely
requires
that
aljs
schedule
hearings
within
90
days
which
the
secretary
told
the
district
court
she
had
the
capacity
to
do
without
moving
resources
into
vermont
to
the
detriment
of
claimants
elsewhere.
the
alj
is
left
unlimited
time
post
hearing
to
develop
a
case,
to
deliberate
upon
a
case
to
ensure
an
accurate
decision.
all
it
is
is
a
docketing
order,
not
a
decision
order.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
day
went
through
the
process,
exhausted
the
entire
administrative
appeals
process,
went
to
district
court
in
an
individual
claim,
had
it
remanded
back
down
for
a
second
hearing
which
ultimately
was
approved
by
the
appeals
council.
the
case
took
three
years,
which,
i
submit,
hardly
says
anything
about
accurate
and
quality
decision
making
by
the
secretary.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--the
interesting
thing
about
that
though
is
that
the
first
five
bites
of
the
apple
he
had
the
secretary
erred,
because
it
ultimately
turned
out
that
he
was
disabled
all
along.
the
facts
of
his
case
illustrate
the
point
that
delay
in
vermont,
as
the
district
court
found
it,
was
unnecessarily
lengthy
and
thereby
unreasonable
and
in
violation
of
the
statute.
as
the
court
probably
knows,
there
is
a
reconsideration
level
that
a
claimant
must
exhaust
before
he
can
even
go
to
hearing
which
is
solely
a
regulatory
creature
that
the
secretary,
in
her
administrative
wisdom,
has
imposed.
we
don't
dispute
the
right
of
her
to
do
that.
it
took
mr.
day
six
months
just
to
get
a
reconsideration
determination
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
through
agency
error,
and
then
after
he
finally
got
an
adverse
reconsideration
determination
in
error
as
it
turned
out,
and
he
requested
his
hearing,
another
six
months
went
by
before
he
got
his
hearing,
again,
through
no
fault
of
his
own,
through
agency
error
only.
it
is
our
position
that
these
kinds
of
facts,
and
they
are
typical
of
the
facts
endured
by
the
class,
justified
the
district
court,
in
a
fact-specific
analysis
situation,
interpreting
a
statute,
to
find
that
that
statute
was
violated.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
government's
argument
almost
makes
it
seem
like
the
government
would
have
preferred
that
in
some
ways.
but,
i
think
if
this
had
been
the
first
case
to
come
along,
as
the
court's
decision
in
califano
v.
yamasaki
shows,
a
nationwide
class
would
have
been
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
in
point
of
fact,
it
would
not
have
been
a
practical
consideration
in
this
case,
because
there
already
existed--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--but...
i
guess
by
excluding
those
districts
where
orders
were
already
in
effect,
it
would
have
had
the
power
to
do
so.
and,
of
course,
ultimately
the
factual
record
would
have
been
far
more
massive
than
the
factual
record
that
needed
to
be
addressed
relating
to
the
vermont
class
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
action
began
in
1978
and
the
district
court's
final
judgment
order
was
in
1981.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
two
to
three
years,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
reason
it
took
unduly
long,
if
that
is
what
it
was,
was
because
the
court
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
took
sufficient
time
to
understand
the
process,
not
rushing
to
judgment
before
it
issued
a
remedial
order
in
favor
of
the
wrong
claimants.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
believe
the
secretary
actually
have
procedures
to
ease
new
administrative
law
judges
into
the
process
at
less
a
rate
of
productivity
than
experienced
administrative
law
judges.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
think
that
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
its
power
reviewing
the
district--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
been
limited
to
reviewing
the
record
of
the
case
that
came
up
before
it.
in
point
of
fact,
the
second
circuit
has
reviewed
a
number
of
other
cases
from
new
york
and
connecticut.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
second
circuit
has
affirmed
other
district
courts
that
have
found
the
secretary
to
be
in
violation
of
the
act
elsewhere.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
am
sorry,
could
you
repeat
it?
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
don't
think
it
could
have
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
was
reviewing
a
vermont
record
and
it
didn't,
in
that
review,
have
knowledge
that
the
delays
were
unnecessary
and
thereby
unreasonable
elsewhere.
if
it
did
have
that
knowledge,
perhaps
it
could.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
but
in
this
case
it
was
and
the
test
for
whether
a
district
court's
injunctive
discretion,
equitable
discretion,
should
be
limited
is
whether
there
exists
a
valid
legislative
command.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
valid
legislative
command
that
precludes
courts
from
protecting
claimants
in
implementing
the
timeliness
provision
inherent
in
section
205(b)
of
the
act.
absent
such
a
command,
the
test
for
this
court
on
review
should
be
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion.
clearly,
i
submit,
it
did
not
because
it
balanced
all
of
the
secretary's
concerns
against
the
needs
of
the
claimants
that
this
remedial
statute
is
designed
to
protect
and
it
achieved
compliance
with
the
act
in
a
timely
fashion
without
injury
to
other
statutory
goals
and
without
harm
to
claimants
elsewhere.
i
also
want
to
emphasize
from
the
factual
record
that
the
district
court...
the
secretary
specifically
told
the
district
court
that
she
had
the
capacity
to
comply
with
its
order
in
vermont
without
the
need
to
adversely
impact
on
other
statutory
goals
or
on
the
rights
of
claimants
elsewhere.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well,
what
is
in
the
record--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--no,
it
has
not
been
changed
at
all.
we
submit
that
if
the
secretary
finds
that
changed
circumstances...
and
they
would
have
to
be
changed,
because
she
had
the
capacity
to
comply
at
the
time
the
district
court
order
issued...
if
change--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--in
the
initial
interrogatories
in
the
joint
appendix
you
will
find
that
the
plaintiffs
asked
the
secretary
how
many
aljs
she
had
working
in
vermont?
the
answer
was
three.
how
many
aljs
are
needed
in
vermont
to
comply
with
your
own
90-day
goal?
and
other
materials
in
the
joint
appendix
will
show
that,
will
support
that.
as
to
the--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--also
in
the
record
you
will
find
report
from
the
secretary's
own
quality
assurance
review
people
and
they
found
that
in
almost
every
case
lengthy
cases
to
process
were
caused
by
lack
of
basic
adherence
to
sound
development
practices
and
lack
of
timely
follow-up
to
request
for
medical
information.
it
it
unfortunate,
but
what
happened
in
vermont
was
that
it
took
the
impetus
of
a
judicial
order
to
enable
to
the
secretary
to
discover
the
capacity
to
process
out
within
a
reasonably
prompt
time
frame
that
she
had
articulated
that
she
had
the
capacity
all
the
time
and
fact,
she
did
have
the
capacity
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
that
is
correct.
let
me
differentiate
though,
the
reconsideration
phase--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--hearings
are
required
to
be
scheduled
only
within
90
days,
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
reconsideration--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--there
is
no
limit.
the
secretary
can
take
as
much
time
as
she
needs
to
render
an
accurate--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--i
think
a
claimant
who
had
to
wait
20
years
would
probably
have
a
good
presumption
working
that
the
processing
was
not
proceeding
in
the
normal
and
proper
fashion.
i
think
good
faith
is
at
issue
in
that
kind
of
circumstance.
what
the
district
court
did
was
simply
left
to
the
secretary,
in
her
administrative
capacity,
the
right
to
make
cases
to
ensure
thoroughness
and
accuracy
of
decision
making.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
secretary
contracts
in
the
individual
states
or
most
of
them
anyway--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--no.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
no.
but,
what
the
secretary...
that
is
why
the
district
court,
although
it
issued
its
preliminary
injunction
as
to
hearing
delays
in
1980,
it
waited
another
year
before
issuing
its
final
judgment
order
and
also
finding
that
reconsideration
delays
were
unreasonable,
because
it
conducted
additional
factual
development.
it
denied
summary
judgment
a
couple
of
times
and
required
additional
factual
development
to
find
out
the
reasons
why
the
reconsideration
delays
were
occurring.
and,
it
found
that
they
were
not
being
done
within
a
reasonably
prompt
time
because
of
such
factors
as
i
have
already
enumerated,
lack
of
adherence
to
sound
development
practices,
lack
of--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--no.
there
is
just
two
aspects
of
it.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
no,
it
is
in
the
record.
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
order.
one
enjoining
delays
at
the
reconsideration
phase,
one
enjoining
unreasonable
delays
at
the
hearing
phase
of
the
process.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
they
are
in
the
judgment
order
itself
which
is
listed--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--the
judgment
order
applies
to
both
hearings
and
reconsiderations.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
i
am
sorry,
i
can't
direct
you
to
this
immediately.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
that
would
be
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
yes,
i
think
that
is
a
good
assumption,
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well,
i
would
submit
that
average
delay
certainly...
average
delay
that
might
seem
somewhat
expeditious.
it
certainly
is
no
solace
to
those
persons
on
the
high
end
of
the
mean
who
suffer
unreasonable
lengthy
delay.
mr.
day,
from
the
time
he
initiated
his
reconsideration,
waited
340
days
just
to
get
his
hearing
scheduled.
in
a
remedial
scheme
like
the
social
security
act
disability
insurance
benefit
program,
i
think
congress
intends
that
all
claimants
should
get
expeditious
action,
not
just
half
of
them.
as
the
undisputed
record
and
the
results
of
this
case
show,
successful
results
were
achievable
in
this
case.
unnecessary
delay
was
eliminated
and
did
not
need
to
be
an
entrenched
aspect
of
the
system.
and,
the
statutory
purpose
could
be
furthered
without
additional
cost
to
the
agency,
without
impact
on
the
needs
of
claimants
elsewhere
and
without
harm
to
other
statutory
goals.
in
vermont
at
least
the
secretary's
administrative
appeal
system
now
runs
smoothly,
the
way
it
should,
and
justice
is
no
longer
denied
through
unnecessary
delay.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
the
white
case
required
hearing
decisions
within
120
days
of
request.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
barnett,
90
days
to
hearing,
similar
to
this
one.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well,
those
cases
were
decided
before--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
congress
was,
in
fact,
aware
of
the
time
limitations
that
certain
courts
had
imposed
and
took
no
action
to
repudiate
them.
there
was
no
clear
and
valid
legislative
command
saying
that
courts
could
not
do
that.
and,
your
position
is
congress
must
have
thought
that
these
cases
represented
an
acceptable
implementation
of
the
reasonableness
requirement?
drawing
inferences
from
congressional
silence
is
always
treacherous,
but,
yes,
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
inference.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
certainly
there
is
nothing
at
the
level
of
a
clear,
valid
legislative
command
precluding
that
kind
of
traditional,
flexible,
equitable
relief.
the
interim
payment
device
as
well
shows
the
same
kind
of
accommodation
toward
the
secretary's
concerns.
in
the
first
place,
the
interim
payments,
which
we
submit
are
not
benefits
but
merely
another
aspect
of
the
court's
flexible
equitable
powers,
ensure
compliance.
they
are
a
yardstick
to
measure
compliance.
they
give
the
secretary
an
undeniable
financial
incentive
to
comply
and,
in
fact,
they
have
worked
in
vermont,
because
there
has
only
been
on
violation
in
the--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--no,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
well,
only
after
unnecessary...
unreasonable
delay
where
none
of
the
exceptions
apply.
that
could
conceivably
happen.
in
practice,
it
does
not,
because
the
secretary
does
comply
because
of
that
incentive
device.
mr.
richard
h.
munzing
thank
you.
