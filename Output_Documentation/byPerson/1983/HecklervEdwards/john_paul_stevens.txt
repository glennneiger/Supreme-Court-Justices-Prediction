justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
final
question?
it
hasn't
been
argued,
but
i'm
just
suggesting
a
rationale
for
requiring
jurisdiction
to
be
accepted
by
this
court
of
congress
might
have
been
that
it
did
not
want
the
attorney
general
to
be
able
to
concede
the
unconstitutionality
of
statutes
without
this
court
in
effect
approving
the
concession,
and
that
therefore
they
wanted
the
mandatory
jurisdiction
here,
because
it's
certainly
conceivable
that
the
attorney
general
might
unwisely
make
a
concession
of
that
kind.
and
that
perhaps
underlies
their
requirement
that
you
tell
the
congress
whenever
you
do
this.
