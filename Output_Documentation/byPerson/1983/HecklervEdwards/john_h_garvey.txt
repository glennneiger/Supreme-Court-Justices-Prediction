mr.
john
h.
garvey
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1252
of
the
judicial
code
provides
that
any
party
may
appeal
to
this
court
from
a
decision
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
holding
unconstitutional
an
act
of
congress.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government
must
appeal
to
this
court
in
a
case
where
it
concedes
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
the
only
issue
is
the
question
of
what
relief
should
be
provided.
the
statute
in
this
case
is
section
211(a)(5)(a)
of
the
social
security
act,
which
deals
with
self-employment
income
from
a
family
business
in
community
property
states.
what
that
section
says
is
that
if
a
family
business
is
not
run
as
a
partnership
then
for
purposes
of
old
age,
survivors
and
disability
insurance
all
the
income
from
the
business
shall
be
attributed
to
the
earnings
account
of
the
husband,
unless
the
wife
is
able
to
show
that
she
exercised
substantially
all
the
management
and
control
of
the
business.
in
1980
the
attorney
general
determined
that
that
presumption
made
in
that
section
was
unconstitutional
and
informed
congress
that
he
would
not
defend
on
appeal
a
case
called
becker
against
califano,
which
had
held
that
section
unconstitutional.
three
weeks
later
respondent
filed
this
action
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
affected
wives
in
community
property
states.
the
government
acknowledged
in
the
district
court
that
the
section
was
unconstitutional
and
did
not
defend
it.
so
the
district
court
shortly
entered
judgment
on
the
uncontested
issue
of
liability
and
held
the
section
unconstitutional.
thereafter
and
until
now,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
has
been
what
relief
should
be
provided
for
that
deficiency
in
the
statute.
the
government
proposed
in
the
district
court
that,
since
the
invalid
provision
was
simply
an
exception
to
section
211(a),
the
general
rule
applying
in
the
42
non-community
property
states,
that
what
the
district
court
should
do
was
what
was
done
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
family
business
wasn't
run
as
a
partnership
then
all
the
income
should
be
attributed
to
one
spouse
or
the
other
without
the
use
of
any
presumption,
after
a
determination
of
which
one
was
chiefly
responsible
for
running
the
business.
the
district
court
disagreed
and
held,
among
other
things,
that
in
community
property
states
the
income
should
be
divided
between
husband
and
wife
according
to
the
amounts
of
their
labor
in
the
business.
the
government
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
dismissed
in
a
one-sentence
order
saying
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
of
section
1252,
and
the
government
then
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
our
position
can
be
summed
up
briefly
in
two
points:
number
one,
only
an
appeal
from
the
constitutional
issue
can
bring
a
case
to
this
court:
number
two,
the
question
of
relief
in
this
case
is
not
part
of
the
constitutional
issue.
let
me
begin
with
the
first
of
those
points.
only
an
appeal
from
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
can
bring
the
case
to
this
court
under
section
1252.
it's
important
to
recognize
at
the
outset
that
section
1252
is
a
unique
jurisdictional
provision.
in
that
section
what
congress
did
was
to
pick
out
from
the
whole
universe
of
cases
that
customary
go
from
the
district
courts
to
the
court
of
appeals
a
few
unique
cases
which,
because
of
their
great
importance,
were
thought
to
warrant
extraordinary
treatment
and
immediate
review
in
this
court.
the
extraordinary
treatment
is,
first
of
all,
tat
they're
within
the
mandatory
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court;
but
in
addition,
they
leapfrog
over
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
unlike
even
cases
coming
to
this
court
under
section
1253,
they
haven't
had
the
benefit
of
review
even
by
three
district
judges
by
getting
here.
the
reason
congress
did
this,
in
the
words
of
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
which
became
section
1252,
the
reason
was
this.
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
said:
"it
is
ridiculous
that
the
final
determination
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
be
held
in
abeyance
for
two
or
three
years
and
nobody
knows
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional.
"
the
house
report
said,
in
similar--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--indeed
i
do.
i
intend
to
turn
there
briefly.
let
me,
if
i
may,
just
finish
this
thought
and
then
i'll
turn
to
the
language
of
the
section.
the
house
report
on
the
bill
said
that
its
purpose
was
to
provide
a
prompt
determination
by
the
court
of
last
resort
of
disputed
questions
of
constitutionality
of
the
acts
of
congress.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
as
i
will
demonstrate
when
i
get
to
my
second
point,
it
does
not
even
involve
a
constitutional
issue.
at
most
what
it
involves
is
something
like
a
question
of
statutory
intent.
at
worst,
it
involves
nothing
more
than
a
simple
question
about
whether
the
district
judge
properly
exercised
her
equitable
discretion
in
providing
a
remedy
for
a
conceded
unconstitutional
provision
in
the
statute.
those
are
like
the
questions
that
the
courts
of
appeals
address
every
day.
they
are
not
the
questions
of
extraordinary
importance
that
congress
determined
should
come
immediately
to
this
court.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that
is
certainly
so.
there
are
many
questions
of
statutory
construction
that
are
more
important
than
some
of
the
kinds
of
questions
that
can
come
to
this
court
under
section
1252.
nevertheless,
section
1252
does
not
turn
on
the
importance
of
the
question,
but
on
whether
an
act
of
congress
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
now,
what
the
statute
provides...
and
we
have
reproduced
it
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
what
the
statute
provides
is,
in
the
first
paragraph
it
addresses
what
should
be
done
with
appeals
from
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
in
the
second
paragraph
it
addresses
what
should
be
done
with
other
issues.
the
first
paragraph
says:
"any
party
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
judgment,
decree
or
order
by
a
court
of
the
united
states
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
any
civil
action
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
"
now,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
that,
in
which
the
language
in
that
first
paragraph,
can
be
read.
but
i
would
suggest
that
only
one
of
them
makes
sense
in
light
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
providing
this
extraordinary
review
mechanism.
one
way
of
understanding
that
language
is
that
any
party
may
appeal
from
any
issue
that
is
decided
in
a
judgment
or
order
along
with
the
issue
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
so
one
way
of
looking
at
the
judgment
or
order
is
that
it's
a
kind
of
grab
bag
and,
provided
the
issue
of
unconstitutionality
is
in
there,
a
party
is
entitled
to
take
any
other
issue
up
to
this
court,
even
if
the
unconstitutional
question
is
not
brought
to
this
court.
so
for
example,
if
in
this
court
in
the
same
judgment
in
which
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
it
had
also
denied
attorney's
fees
to
the
plaintiff,
this
grab
bag
interpretation
of
the
first
section
would
entitle
the
plaintiff
to
bring
up
to
this
court
the
question
of
her
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees,
even
though
the
constitutional
question
is
not
presented.
or,
to
take
another
example,
if
in
the
same
judgment
the
district
court
had
decided
a
pendent
question
of
state
law
and
nobody
was
interested
in
appealing
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
this
grab
bag
way
of
reading
the
first
paragraph
would
entitle
the
losing
party
on
the
question
of
state
law
to
bring
it
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
exactly
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
as
i
said,
the
language
and
the
syntax
of
that
paragraph
will
support
that
reading.
i
suggest
that
that
reading
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense
in
light
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
adopting
that
section,
and
that
there
is
another
reading
which
can
be
given
to
it,
which
is
that
the
first
paragraph
is
entitled
to
authorize
only
appeals
from
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
that
that
is
the
issue
which
brings
the
whole
case
to
this
court
and
that's
an
essential
prerequisite
for
getting
the
case
up
here
under
the
first
paragraph.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
a
conscious
decision
or
not.
that
interpretation
of
the
first
paragraph
of
section
1252
i
think
is,
the
interpretation
we
propose,
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
second
paragraph,
because
what
the
second
paragraph
says
is
that
once
this
notice
of
appeal,
which
i
think
is
this
proper
section
1252
notice
of
appeal,
is
filed,
the
second
paragraph
tells
you
what
to
do
with
the
other
issues
in
the
case.
it
says
if
any
of
those
issues
have
been
taken
to
other
courts...
that
is
to
say,
to
the
court
of
appealss...
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
proper
section
1252
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court,
they
shall
be
treated
as
taken
directly
to
this
court...
that
is
to
say,
they
will
be
transferred
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court...
when
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
is
brought
here,
so
that
the
whole
case
can
be
decided
together.
it
also
says
in
the
first
paragraph
that
the
party
who
has
received
a
notice
of
appeal
under
this
section
shall
take
any
subsequent
appeal
or
cross-appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
the
reason
for
that
direction
is,
in
the
example
that
i
gave
earlier,
if
the
winning
party
is
sitting
around
drafting
her
notice
of
appeal
on
the
question
of
attorney's
fees
to
the
court
of
appeals,
where
it
would
go
but
for
an
appeal
to
this
court
on
the
question
of
unconstitutionality,
the
first
sentence
says
that
she
ought
instead
to
file
the
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
because
the
appeal
on
the
constitutional
question
has
brought
the
case
here.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes,
they
would.
the
second
paragraph,
by
leapfrogging
over
the
court
of
appeals,
deprives
those
parties
appealing
on
other
issues
of
their
usual
right
to
have
at
least
one
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
that
is
our
first
point,
that
only
an
appeal
from
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality
can
bring
the
case,
although
it
brings
the
whole
case,
to
this
court
under
section
1252.
our
second
point
is
that
the
question
of
relief
in
this
case
is
not
a
part
of
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
respondent
has
maintained
that
the
issue
of
relief
here
is
an
intrinsic
aspect
of
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
but
that
is
not
so,
as
i
think
a
couple
of
examples
ought
to
make
clear.
suppose
that
what
the
district
court
had
done
in
this
case
after
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional
was
to
adopt
the
approach
the
government
suggested.
suppose
the
district
court
had
concluded
that,
because
this
exception
to
the
general
rule
in
section
211(a)
was
invalid,
that
it
ought
to
apply
the
basic
rule
in
section
211(a)
that
applies
in
non-community
property
states.
if
respondent,
plaintiff
in
the
district
court,
had
appealed
that
issue
of
relief
to
this
court,
respondent
would
not
be
able
to
contest
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
having
prevailed
on
it
in
the
district
court.
and
the
government,
having
conceded
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
211(a)(5)(a),
would
have
no
interest
in
contesting
it
in
this
court,
and
yet
the
appeal
would
be
brought
directly
here.
or
to
take
an
even
more
extreme
example,
suppose
the
district
court
had
gone
a
step
further
and
actually...
suppose
this
were
an
individual
action.
suppose
the
district
court
had
gone
a
step
further
and
actually
recomputed
the
respondent's
earnings
account.
suppose
that
on
the
basis
of
that
recomputation
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
collect
$200
in
old
age
benefits
under
the
social
security
act,
and
suppose
that
respondent
believed
she
was
entitled
to
collect
$205
a
month.
if
relief
is
in
fact
an
intrinsic
part
of
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
respondent
would
be
entitled
to
bring
to
this
court
her
disagreement
with
the
district
court
about
the
additional
$5
a
month,
notwithstanding
that
again
she
couldn't
contest
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
having
prevailed
on
that
issue
in
the
district
court.
or,
to
take
just
one
more
example,
suppose
the
district
court
had
done
what
it
did
in
this
case
and
said
that
the
income
was
to
be
divided
between
husband
and
wife,
but
that
the
district
court
had
declined
to
recompute
earnings
accounts
back
to
1950
because,
the
court
might
say,
some
wives
are
going
to
be
better
off
under
those
earnings
accounts,
under
the
earnings
accounts
of
their
husbands,
than
they
will
be
under
the
new
standard,
and
we
don't
want
to
disturb
their
reliance
interests;
and
some
husbands
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
benefits
if
we
recompute.
so
we'll
just
make
this
prospective.
once
again,
when
the
case
got
to
this
court
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
211(a)(5)(a).
now,
what
those
examples
show,
i
think,
are
two
things.
what
they
show
first
of
all
is
that
there
is
involved
in
this
case
at
this
point
no
constitutional
question
whatever.
the
choice
among
the
three
types
of
relief
that
i
suggested
in
those
examples
is
not
determined
by
the
constitution.
all
three
of
them
are
constitutionally
permissible.
what's
more,
the
type
of
relief
that
the
district
court
chose,
the
one
of
those
three
that
i
suggested
or
another
one,
the
one
that
it
chose,
the
type
of
relief
that
the
district
court
chose
might
in
fact
be,
for
all
we
know,
precisely
the
one
that
congress
would
prefer
it
to
apply,
given
the
unconstitutionality
of
section
211(a)(5)(a),
which
everybody
concedes.
that
means
that
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
question
of
relief,
unlike
its
decision
on
the
question
of
unconstitutionality,
may
very
well
be
quite
consistent
with
the
wishes
of
congress.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
indeed
not.
but
whether
or
not
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
wishes
of
congress
is
something
that
at
this
point
we
don't
know,
whereas
its
holding
on
section
211(a)(5)(a)
we
do
know
is
inconsistent
with
what
congress
wanted,
because
wrote
that
into
the
statute
and
the
district
court
said
that
statute
is
invalid.
so
the
question
of
relief
may
very
well
be
consistent
with
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
and
in
that
case
i
would
suggest
that
there
isn't
the
need
for
immediate
review
in
this
court
that
exists
in
the
case
where
the
statute
is
actually
held
unconstitutional
and
that
issue
is
still
being
litigated.
now,
i
said
that
those
examples
showed
two
things
and
one
of
them
was
that
the
case
didn't
really
involve
any
question
of
unconstitutionality;
in
fact,
it
really
involves
a
question
of
what
congress
would
want
to
do,
or
maybe
what
it
involves
is
a
question
about
equitable
discretion.
for
example,
in
last
example
that
i
gave
the
district
court
took
account
of
the
reliance
interests
of
people
who
were
already
collecting
benefits
under
the
invalid
provision
and
said
that
maybe
the
most
equitable
approach
is
to
protect
their
interests
by
making
the
judgment
prospective.
those
kinds
of
decisions
about
what
congress
had
in
mind,
about
the
equitable...
about
the
reliance
interests
of
people
who
are
already
collecting
benefits,
are
the
kinds
of
questions
that
the
court
of
appeals
decide
every
day
in
cases
of
statutory
construction,
in
cases
where...
in
other
cases
involving
issues
about
the
proper
remedy.
what's
more,
the
impact
of
the
decision
on
the
question
of
relief
is
quite
unlike
the
impact
of
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
the
impact
might
only
be
a
difference
of
five
dollars
a
month,
as
was
shown
in
the
second
example
that
i
gave.
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
i
think
this
is
precisely
the
question
that
arose
in
montana
contractors
against
kreps,
a
case
in
which
this
court
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
issue
in
montana
contractors
was
whether
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
collect
damages
after
the
district
court
held
the
minority
business
enterprise
provision
of
the
public
works
employment
act
unconstitutional.
and
i
presume
because
the
government
did
not
docket
a
separate
appeal
on
the
question
of
unconstitutionality,
this
court
dismissed
plaintiff's
appeal
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
entitled
to
damages
because
of
the
enforcement
of
that
provision.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
your
summary
action
does
not
explain
it,
although
it
does
note
that
the
dismissal
is
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
would
also
suggest,
justice
stevens,
that
it
may
be,
with
the
less
frequent
use
of
three-judge
courts
nowadays,
that
the
question
may
be
one
of
more
significance
in
future
cases
than
it
has
been
in
the
past.
we
suggested
in
our
reply
brief
that
the
question
might
come
up
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
decision
in
ins
against
chada
about
questions
of
severability,
which
we
say
are
really
no
different
from
the
question
of
relief
involved
in
this
case.
so
it
is
one
which
i
think
has
not
only
arisen
in
the
past,
but
may
reoccur
with
some
frequency.
let
me
make
just
one
last
point.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
this
court
should
review
the
question
of
relief
or
not.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
court
should
immediately
review
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
issue
of
relief,
because
we
presume
that
if
an
appeal
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
impact
of
the
relief
really
were
severe
and
it
really
was
fairly
clear
that
the
relief
chosen
was
not
the
one
that
congress
would
have
preferred,
that
certiorari
is
always
available
from
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
question
of
relief
under
section
1254(1).
so
the
question
is
not
whether
this
court
should
review
it;
it's
whether
it
should
review
it
immediately,
rather
than
after
having
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals'
determination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
just
have
three
brief
points,
if
i
may.
if
i
understand
correctly
what
respondent's
counsel
has
said,
essentially,
unless
they're
able
to
win
on
this
unlikely
point
regarding
the
first
paragraph,
what
this
case
all
boils
down
to
is
whether
the
relief
in
this
case
is
constitutionally
mandated.
that,
as
the
examples
that
i
gave
showed
and
as
all
the
cases
cited
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
3
to
5
indicate,
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
a
rather
technical
point
in
response
to
a
concern
by
justice
rehnquist.
you
pointed
out
that
under
the
second
paragraph
of
1252
congress
at
least
contemplated
that
some
kinds
of
appeals
would
be
filed
to
the
court
of
appeals
prior
to
the
filing
of
what
i
have
been
calling
the
proper
section
1252
notice
of
appeal.
respondent
in
her
reply
brief
indicated
that
those
prior
appeals
were
probably
appeals
taken
under
section
1292(b)
of
the
judicial
code.
in
fact,
section
1292(b)
was
not
enacted
until
1958,
so
it's
unlikely
that
they
had
1292(b)
appeals
in
mind.
there
were...
there
was
a
narrow
class
of
interlocutory
appeals
that
could
be
taken
before
that
time,
although
they
weren't
even
the
kinds
of
appeals
that
rule
54(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
contemplate,
because
that
rule
didn't
exist
in
1937
either.
there
was
a
narrow
class
that
congress
probably
had
in
mind
as
well,
simply
a
question
of
who
beat
in
filing
the
notice
of
appeal.
and
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is
that,
if
we
should
lose
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
should
not
be
like
the
disposition
of
the
richland
county
case.
in
the
richland
county
case,
in
the
government's
brief
in
this
court
we
conceded
that
we
had
gone
to
the
wrong
court
in
taking
our
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and,
as
this
court
said,
the
direction
in
which
we
should
have
gone
was
clear
under
this
court's
precedents.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
i
think
we
had
very
good
reason
for
believing
in
montana
contractors
against
kreps
that
the
proper
place
for
us
to
go
was
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
to
this
court.
and
so
if
we
should
be
wrong
about
where
we
should
have
gone,
at
least
the
proper
disposition
would
be
to
remand
to
the
district
court
for
entry
of
a
fresh
decree
from
which
we
may
take
a
proper
appeal
to
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
conceivable,
although
i,
having
read
the
legislative
history,
have
found
no
indication
of
that.
and
what's
more,
the
attorney
general's
choice
to
intervene
or
not
in
these
cases
is
discretionary,
so
that
he
may
let
go
by
a
holding
of
unconstitutionality
without
even
getting
involved.
i
think
in
light
of
that
what
you
suggest
is
not
probable.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
we
would
still
be
taking
the
same
position.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
a
fortiori,
we
should
be
right
when
we
concede.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
rest.
