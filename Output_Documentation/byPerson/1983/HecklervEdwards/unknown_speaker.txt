unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
do
you
propose
to
shift
at
some
point
in
your
argument
from
the
statement
of
the
sponsors
to
the
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
some
issues,
although
not
constitutional
ones,
can
be
as
important
in
other
ways.
unknown
speaker
by
calling
it
a
grab
bag
way
of
reading
the
paragraph,
are
you
suggesting
it's
not
a
preferred
or
not
a
reasonable
way
of
looking
at
the
paragraph?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
it
doesn't
seem
implausible
to
me,
given
the
language
you
just
read,
that
you
say
any
party
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
particular
kind
of
final
judgment.
what
kind
of
final
judgment?
a
final
judgment
holding
any
act
of
congress
unconstitutional.
and
if
the
final
judgment
meets
that
definition,
it
may
contain
a
number
of
other
provisions,
and
if
you
want
to
appeal
any
of
them
you
have
to
go
to
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
did
the
united
states
take
a
protective
appeal
here?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
conscious
decision?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
garvey,
that
you
have
the
whole
range.
you
have
a
decision
on
constitutionality,
which
would
clearly
in
your
view
bring
the
case
directly
here,
but
that
there
were
also
some
remedial
factors
and
some
attorney's
fees.
is
there
any
statute
that
would
prevent
this
court,
after
it
had
decided
the
constitutional
question,
to
remand
the
case
for
a
determination,
for
an
examination
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
other
two
questions
that
were
not
constitutional?
or
would
this
court
be
required
to
decide
all
the
issues?
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
be
required
to
decide
all
the
issues.
i
think
the
reason
why
the
second
paragraph
directs
the
other
issues
to
be
brought
to
this
court
is
that
in
the
ordinary
case
the
party
bringing
them
up
won't
yet
have
had
a
chance
to
have
them
reviewed
and
congress
didn't
want
those
issues
being
decided
simultaneously
with
the
decision
on
the
constitutional
question
in
this
court
so
that
inconsistent
results
might
be
reached.
but
the
procedure
you
suggest
wouldn't
result
in
possible
inconsistencies
in
the
determinations.
but
one
way
or
another,
the
parties
would
be
entitled
to
review
of
the
district
court
in
some
way?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
it
was
not
consistent
with
the
government's
arguments
there
as
to
what
the
intent
of
congress
was.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
use
hypothetical
examples,
which
is
understandable
because
this
problem
doesn't
exactly
arise
every
day.
how
often
has
this
particular
problem...
has
it
ever
arisen
before
where
the
attorney
general
has
conceded
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
presume.
certainly
our
summary
action
doesn't
explain
it,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dudovitz,
i'm
curious
to
know
how
much
of
your
position
depends
on
the
form
of
the
government's
notice
of
appeal.
supposing
everything
were
the
same
here
except
the
government's
notice
of
appeal
said,
the
government
appeals
from
all
of
that
order
the
district
court
entered
except
that
portion
holding
such
and
such
unconstitutional.
do
you
think
that
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
concession
of
unconstitutionality
was
made
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
it.
would
there
then
be
a
decision
under
1252
on
the
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
should
be
done?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
i
mean
when
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
not
having
passed
on
it
but
having
accepted
the
concession,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
no,
we
don't
accept
concessions
on
constitutional
issues
and
we're
going
to
decide
it.
then
could
they
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
as
an
appeal
and
not
as
a
cert.--
unknown
speaker
--certainly
there
are
intimations
in
the
second
paragraph,
aren't
there?
unknown
speaker
but
now
take
the
second
sentence
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
2
of
the
brief:
"all
appeals
or
cross
appeals
taken
to
other
courts
prior
to
such
notice
shall
be
treated
as
taken
directly
to
the
supreme
court.
"
now,
that
hypothesizes
that
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
some
party
would
have
been
proper
in
the
case
of
a
judgment
which
held
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
part
of
what
the
statute
is
trying
to
do.
but
another
part,
as
your
opponent
has
suggested,
is
to
select
out
a
very
few
cases
that
congress
felt
deserved
the
immediate
attention
of
this
court,
and
certainly
the
focus
of
congress
was
on
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
our
cases
support
you.
if
i
understand
your
contention,
you're
saying
that
once
congress
has
decided
to
expand
the
mandatory
docket
by
passing
a
statute
such
as
1252,
that
statute
ought
to
be
generously
construed.
now,
i
think
that
the
whole
history
of
the
three-judge
court
situation
and
appeals
from
three-judge
courts
indicates
that
this
court
recognizes
when
congress
wants
to
increase
our
mandatory
docket,
but
it
doesn't
construe
those
statutes
generously
or
beneficently,
or
whatever
you
want
to
use,
the
term.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
it
said
in
mclucas
was
that
it
shouldn't
be
construed
in
the
same
way
that
the
three-judge
court
appeal
statute
was,
where
we
held
that
in
order
to
have
the
appeal
the
three-judge
court
had
to
have
jurisdiction.
we
said
that
wasn't
required
here.
but
i
don't
think
that
really
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
we'll
treat
as
broadly
as
possible
the
substantive
definitions
of
what
can
be
appealed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dudovitz,
you
have
referred
to
the
grace
brethren
church
case
as
supporting
your
view
and
it
seems
to
me
it
does
no
such
thing.
jurisdiction
under
1252
in
that
case
was
premised
on
the
district
court's
implicit
but
necessary
holding
that
the
federal
statute
was
unconstitutional,
and
the
government
challenged
that
holding.
that's
the
point
which
you
omitted.
unknown
speaker
but
grace
brethren
was
wrestling
with
the
problem
of
whether
it
was
an
implicit
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
unknown
speaker
that's
all.
it
didn't
deal
with
this
question
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
found,
of
course,
that
implicitly
the
federal
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
and
the
government
challenged
that.
so
it
is
not
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dudovitz,
while
you're
pausing
let
me
just
be
sure
i'm
right
about
one
assumption.
taking
your
opponent's
hypothetical
appeal
on
attorney's
fees,
where
you
wanted
to
appeal
because
the
court
didn't
allow
them,
denied
an
allowance
entirely,
you
would
agree
that
should
come
here
under
your
reading
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
it's
a
single
judgment.
the
court
says,
it's
hereby
ordered
that
the
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional,
that's
paragraph
one.
paragraph
two
is,
there
will
be
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
of
$1,000.
you
appeal
from
that
judgment
and
you
say,
the
only
relief
i
want
is
an
increase.
you
are
not
contending
that
that
appeal
would
be
to
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
whether
you're
saying
there
would
be
jurisdiction
here
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
in
effect
arguing,
you're
challenging
your
opponent's
second
point
rather
than
his
first
point.
in
other
words,
he
argues:
one,
it
has
to
be
an
appeal
from
the
constitutional
holding;
and
secondly,
he
argues
this
case
does
not
involve
a
constitutional
issue.
you're
response
to
that
is:
no,
this
case
does
involve
a
constitutional
issue
and
that's
why
it's
appealable.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
arguing
that
it
would
be
appealable
even
if
it
did
not
present
a
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
you're
not,
then,
really
relying
on
your
sort
of
plain
language...
you're
not
resting
your
whole--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
whether
it's
a
constitutional
ruling
or
not
that's
being
appealed?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you're
much
less
confident
on
that
argument,
as
i
understand
you.
you
aren't
taking
a
four-square
position
that
the
attorney
fee
issue
by
itself
would
be
appealable.
unknown
speaker
anything
further,
mr.
garvey?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
would
be
taking
the
same
position
even
more
strongly
if
you
had
contested
the
constitutionality...
had
attempted
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
in
the
district
court
and
you
lost,
and
then,
rather
than
appeal
that
declaration,
you
appealed
only
the
remedy.
unknown
speaker
you'd
go
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
were
right
then,
you
should
be
right
when
you
concede?
