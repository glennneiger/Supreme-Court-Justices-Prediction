mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today
involves
both
determining
the
parameters
of
the
appeals
to
this
court
as
well
as
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
1291.
as
the
government
has
acknowledged,
the
federal
district
court
in
this
case
did
hold
a
federal
statute,
section
211(a)(5)(a)
of
the
social
security
act,
unconstitutional.
it
also
went
forward
and
awarded
constitutionally
adequate
relief
to
the
class
members
whose
rights
were
violated.
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
district
court
order
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional.
but
they
filed
that
notice
of
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
not
to
this
court.
there
was,
as,
justice
blackmun,
you
noted
by
your
question,
no
protective
appeal
filed
in
this
court.
section
1291,
which
sets
forth
the
jurisdictional
parameters
for
the
court
of
appeals,
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
have
jurisdiction
if
it's
possible
for
there
to
be
an
appeal
to
this
court.
the
operative
word
in
the
statute
is
the
word
"may".
if
you
may
appeal
to
this
court,
then
the
court
of
appeals
loses
its
jurisdiction.
and
as
this
court
has
emphasized
recently
in
its
donovan
case,
what
that
means
is
is
that
there
is
only
one
place
for
you
to
go
when
you're
appealing
from
an
order
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional.
the
issue
here
then
turns
on
whether
or
not
this
case
presents
a
situation
where
the
place
for
the
government
to
go
if
they
had
an
appeal
was
this
court.
we
believe
that
the
requirements
of
1252
are
pretty
clear
right
on
its
face.
they
talk
about,
as
most
of
the
commentaries
have
pointed
out,
four
basic
requirements,
three
of
which...
that
it
be
from
a
proper
court,
that
it
be
a
civil
action,
the
government
be
a
party...
are
really
not
controversial
and
certainly
are
not
in
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
fourth
requirement,
that
the
order
being
appealed
from
must
be
from
a
holding
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional.
well,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
from
which
the
government
appealed
was
in
fact
such
an
order.
and
it
is
important
to
recognize
in
this
case
that
their
notice
of
appeal
purports
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal
from
that
entire
order.
it
simply
says,
we're
appealing
from
that
final
judgment
where
the
court,
the
district
court,
held
the
statute
unconstitutional.
we
contend
that,
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
notice,
which
fits
squarely
within
1252
and
particularly
so
in
a
situation
as
here
where
the
issue
the
government
wants
to
contest
is
really
the
relief
that
the
court
fashioned
consistent
with
the
constitution
to
remedy
the
violation.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
no,
i
don't
think
that
should
have
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
government
did
that
sort
of
highlights
why
this
case
is
appropriate,
but
in
and
of
itself
it
is
not
determinative.
and
that
is
because
what
it
highlights
essentially
is
there
was
a
choice.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
under
1291
when
there's
a
possibility
that
seems
to
point
us
toward
1252.
in
fact,
the
government
would
concede
that.
the
government
would
concede
that
they
in
fact
could
have
appealed
the
constitutional
issue
to
this
court
even
though
they
didn't
contest
it
in
the
district
court,
similar
to
what
happened
in
the
clark
case,
where
they
didn't
contest
it
in
the
court
of
claims
and
then
appealed
it
to
this
court.
so
that's
something
that
the
government
says
can
happen.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
yes,
there
would,
because--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--1252
is
not
limited
to
applicability
in
the
district
court.
it
also
applies
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i
guess
your
question
presumes
that
it
was
proper
for
that
case
to
get
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
place.
if
it
was,
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
if
it
was
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
holds
the
statute
unconstitutional,
then
you're
going
to
be
under
1252
and
the
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
could
come
directly
to
this
court
because,
as
i
was
saying,
1252
is
not
limited
to
the
district
court.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
not
as
a
cert,
that's
correct.
with
regard
to
the
relationship
of
the
relief
to
the
constitutional
question,
i
would
point
out
that
the
government
itself
agrees,
as
they've
noted
on
page
3
of
their
reply
brief,
that
the
district
court
must
address
the
questions
of
relief
as
a
consequence
of
holding
that
statute
unconstitutional.
that
is
something
the
court
had
to
do.
that
was
part
of
its
job
once
it
found
that
statute
unconstitutional.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
puts
that
issue
as
a
predicate;
that
the
predicate
to
that
issue
therefore
is
the
holding
of
unconstitutionality,
which
therefore
binds
the
government
to
do
something.
and
that's
the
kind
of
problem
that
the
court...
excuse
me...
that
congress
wanted
to
bring
to
this
court.
when
the
government
was
going
to
be
bound,
when
something
was
going
to
happen
to
the
government
as
a
result
of
holding
the
statute
unconstitutional,
congress
wanted
this
court
to
quickly
and
promptly
resolve
that
problem,
to
make
sure
that
the
disruption
to
the
government
was
minimum.
now,
the
government's
line
here
that
they've
attempted
to
draw
we
contend
just
plainly
doesn't
fit
within
the
statute
on
its
face.
they
are
trying
to
draw,
in
a
sense
here,
lines
which
do
not
exist.
there
is
no
phrase
or
statement
in
section
1252
that
suggests
that
the
issues
to
be
appealed
must
be
the
question
of
constitutionality.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
there
are,
but
it's
very
different,
your
honor,
from
the
kinds
of
language
that
exist
in
the
other
direct
appeal
statutes,
that
talk
more
about
the
kinds
of
issues,
such
as
1257
and
1254.
and
it's
also
very
different
from
the
earlier
predecessor
of
1252,
which
was
repealed
in
1925.
and
in
that
earlier
language,
which
the
government
cites
in
its
cert
petition
at
page
11,
the
statute
said
that
in
any
case
that
involves
constitutional
construction
on
application
of
the
constitution
or
in
which
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
u.s.
are
brought
into
question,
that
that's
when
you
bring
a
case
up.
now,
the
congress
didn't
go
back
and
bring
that
language
back.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
well,
i
contend
and
we
have
argued
that
what
that
could
very
well
be
referring
to
is
in
fact
other
kinds
of
appeals,
such
as
interlocutory
appeals,
which
may
have
been
appropriate
in
the
court
of
appeals
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
act
being
unconstitutional.
the
real
import
of
the
entire
second
paragraph
is
to
make
sure
that
when
this
court
gets
a
case
where
an
act
has
been
held
unconstitutional,
it
gets
all
aspects
of
the
case
so
that
it
has
the
power
to
determine
what
should
be
done
in
this
situation
to
make
a
final
and
quick
decision
in
order,
again,
to
avoid
disruption
to
the
government.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
well,
i
agree
it's
very
few
cases,
and
i
can
partly,
i
think,
try
to
answer
justice
stevens'
question
about
how
many
cases.
there
is
a
statute,
which
of
course
the
government
has
cited,
which
requires
the
attorney
general
to
notify
congress
when
they're
not
going
to
appeal
from
a
holding
of
unconstitutionality.
it's
my
understanding
that
in
the
years
'81,
'82
and
'83,
subsequent
to
this
case,
there
have
been
two
times
where
the
attorney
general
has
so
notified
the
government.
that's
other
than
the
one
time
before
in
this
case.
we're
not...
this
is
one
of
those
unique
cases.
there
aren't
very
many
times
when
this
happens.
in
fact,
the
government
itself
points
out
the
great
difficulty
it
always
has
in
conceding
the
unconstitutionality,
that
they
rarely
do
that.
so
this
is
a
unique
case.
i
don't
think
it's
a
common
case
in
any
way.
let
me
add,
justice
rehnquist,
to
one
other
major
reason
i
believe
that
the
kind
of
line
that
the
government
wants
to
draw
here
in
terms
of
constitutionality
doesn't
make
sense,
and
that
is
because
it's
really
premised
on
the
theory
that
in
interpreting
the
statute
this
court
ought
to
be
trying
to
minimize
its
mandatory
docket.
now,
whether
or
not
we
all
think
that
that's
something
that
ought
to
be
done,
the
fact
is
that
this
court
has
held
very
explicitly
that
1252
is
not
to
be
so
interpreted.
in
fact,
the
purpose
of
1252,
as
this
court
has
held
before,
is
to
expand
the
mandatory
docket
and
not
restrict
it.
and
therefore,
the
court
should
not
view
the
language
here
with
the
idea
of
supporting
the
minimizing
of
the
mandatory
docket,
but
rather
with
the
idea
of
what
congress
desired.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i
think
this
court
has
explicitly
said,
going
back
to
the
mclucas
case
and
in
the
grace
brethren
church
case,
that
1252
is
not
to
be
construed
in
the
same
fashion
as
1253,
the
three-judge
court.
it
is
separate--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--well,
i
guess,
justice
rehnquist,
as
i
read
those
cases
the
court
has
really
said
that
the
basis
for
the
1253
cases
was
in
fact
carrying
out
the
principle
of
limiting
the
mandatory
docket
of
this
court,
and
as
a
result
that
1253
was
going
to
be
interpreted,
if
interpretation
was
necessary,
in
a
restrictive
way.
on
the
other
hand,
the
cases...
and
they
go
back
before
these
three-judge
court
cases.
the
reid
case,
where
the
word
"party"
was
interpreted;
that
the
court
specifically
said,
we're
not
going
to
take
a
restrictive
view
of
the
word
"party",
we're
going
to
take
a
more
broader
view
of
the
word
"party".
another...
let
me
add
a
final
point
on
what
i
think
are
some
problems
with
the
government's
line
drawing,
and
that
is
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
that
line
and
then
make
it
consistent
with
the
footnote
in
the
regan
case,
where
it
says
that
an
appeal
by
a
party
who
succeeded
in
the
lower
court
on
an
issue
which
the
lower
court
found
to
be
constitutional
fits
within
the
first
paragraph.
that
is
not
an
appeal
on
the
issue
for
which
the
court
held
unconstitutional
at
all,
and
in
fact,
as
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
its
reply
brief
in
regan,
the
real
reason
for
that
appeal
was
relief,
because
in
order
for
the
plaintiffs
to
get
the
relief
they
wanted
they
needed
to
try
to
succeed
on
a
different
issue.
they
were
really
appealing
relief.
and
the
court
didn't
say
that
that
issue
comes
up
under
the
second
paragraph
as
a
further
appeal
once
the
government
made
its
appeal.
instead,
it
said
it
comes
up
under
the
first
paragraph.
it
comes
up
under
that
more
broad
language.
and
i
think
that
that's
consistent
with
what
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
well,
i
understand
that
the
government
challenged
the
constitutional
holding.
but
it
seems
to
me...
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
case
that
the
court
has
actually
handled
that
is
exactly
the
same
as
this
case.
probably
we
wouldn't
all
be
here
if
that
were
true.
but
what
grace
brethren
does,
i
believe,
is
it
follows
a
line
of
cases
from
this
court
which
indicates
the
broader
interpretation
of
what
it
means
to
hold
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional.
we
have
cases
like
fleming,
where--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--right.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
what
it
does,
i
think,
is
it
follows
from
first
the
holding
that
you
don't
really
have
to
hold
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional;
it
can
be
the
act
applied,
which
is
a
much
earlier
line
of
cases
from
the
fleming
case.
and
then...
and
i
do
think
that
it's
taken
at
least
somewhat
of
a
step
further
to
say,
not
only
do
you
not
have
to
hold
the
act
itself
unconstitutional,
but
in
fact
if
you
held
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
but
it
effectively
tied
in
the
federal
statute
and
affected
the
operation
of
the
statute
program,
the
federal
government...
i
think
the
language
of
grace
brethren
talks
about
the
federal
government
being
effectively
bound
by
that
decision
of
the
lower
court...
then
you're
also
under
1252.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i
wouldn't
disagree
that
it
was
not
this
case.
all
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
that
its
view
of
how
to
interpret
1252
is
consistent,
i
believe,
with
our
view
of
how
you
interpret
1252.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i
would
not.
i
think
what
comes
here
under
my
reading
of
the
statute
is
relief
that
is
necessary
to
remedy
the
constitutional
wrong.
the
attorney
fees
relief
doesn't
come
from
that.
it
really
comes
from
a
separate
statutory
basis.
that
is,
if
the
statute
wasn't
there,
if
we
didn't
have
the
equal
access
to
justice
statute--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--let
me
try
to
clarify
that.
i
think
my
view
is
that
as
the
statute
is
set
out
that
definitely
does
fit
within
it,
and
i
think
that's
how
this
court
has
to
interpret
the
statute,
that
that's
correct
that--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--on
its
face
i
think
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
this
court
feels...
and
i
would
point
out
also
that
we're
far
different
from
that--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--situation
in
this
case.
but
if
this
court
feels
that
it
has
to
in
a
sense
draw
some
lines...
i
mean,
i
think
the
statute
is
fairly
clear
on
its
face,
but
if
you
have
to
draw
some
lines,
the
relief
aspects
i
think
that
fit
within
the
constitutional
question
are
constitutionally
required
relief.
and
attorney
fees
is
not
constitutionally
required
relief.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
that's
right.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
probably
partly
arguing
both.
i
think
that--
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
--i
would
not
rest
solely
on
the
plain
language.
i
think
even
if
you
don't
do
the
plain
language
we're
still
there,
because
effectively
this
is
a
constitutional
ruling.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
but
under
the
plain
language
there's
no
doubt.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
the
government
would
concede,
if
the
plain
language
were
correctly
undoubtedly
this
case
should
have
been
here
under
1252.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
well,
as
long
as
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
s.
dudovitz
i'm
saying
that
i
think
you
can
set
that
issue
aside
if
you
want
to,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
relief
doesn't
flow
directly
as
a
remedy
for
the
constitutional
violation.
let
me
finally
turn
to
one
other
point
which
the
government
has
requested
here
to
this
court
which
i
want
to
address
briefly,
and
that
is
they
have
asked
that,
even
if
this
court
determines
that
we
are
correct,
that
the
court
ought
to
vacate
the
district
court's
order
and
remand
to
allow
the
district
court
to
enter
a
new
judgment,
from
which
a
new
notice
of
appeal
could
be
filed,
and
therefore
they
could
then
appeal
to
this
court
and
have
the
relief
issues
brought
here.
we
think
that
that
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
action
for
this
court
to
take
should
the
court
decide
in
our
favor.
i
think
the
question
of
whether
you
do
that
or
not
is
really
an
equitable
kind
of
decision
and
you
must
look
at
what
the
effects
of
that
are
and
what
actions
of
the
government
ought
to
be
protected
here.
first,
the
effects
of
it
could
be
very
disastrous
to
the
class
members
in
this
case,
who
are
old
and
disabled
women
who,
as
the
district
court
noted,
are
largely
living
on
the
social
security
benefits,
some
of
which
they
receive
as
a
result
of
this,
the
district
court's
ruling.
the
district
court's
relief
has
been
fully
put
into
place
by
now.
in
fact,
it
was
required
to
be
so
by
august
1983.
the
government,
while
it
sought
a
stay
in
the
district
court,
did
not
pursue
the
stay.
they
did
not
argue
that
having
the
relief
implemented
while
this
was
going
on
was
going
to
be
necessarily
particularly
harmful
to
them.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
their
failure
to
do
that,
the
effect
that
this
has
on
the
class
members,
and
finally
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
take
any
action
which
you
ought
to
really
protect,
which
justice
blackmun
pointed
out
by
his
question,
they
didn't
file
a
protective
notice...
and
it
seems
to
me
after
the
donovan
case,
which
you
remember
came
down
three
or
four
months
before
the
final
judgment
in
this
case,
that
at
worst
from
the
government's
position
there
were
some
questions
to
be
asked
as
to
where
an
appeal
ought
to
go.
the
government
didn't
do
anything
in
this
situation
to
try
to
suggest
that
they
were...
to
protect
themselves.
they
could
have
filed
two
notices
of
appeal,
something
that
happens
all
the
time.
they
could
have
tried
to
say
something
in
their
notice
of
appeal.
they
could
have
done
something
to
indicate
their
awareness
of
what
they
say
is
a
difficult
problem.
given
those
circumstances
and
the
effect
on
the
plaintiffs,
and
finally
noting
that
if
what's
left
here
in
this
case
is
just
the
relief
ordered
by
the
district
court
that
also
is
relief
that
can
be
remedied
somewhere
else.
congress
can
remedy
that
if
the
government
thinks
that
the
relief
that's
left
by
the
district
court
is
particularly
inappropriate.
in
fact,
congress
has
acted
on
many
occasions
in
these
social
security
sex
discrimination
cases
to
set
forth
new
rules
and
new
standards.
so
that
to
leave
in
place
relief
for
a
statute
we
all
agree
is
unconstitutional
and
then
to
have
another
forum
available
to
remedy
that
relief
it
seems
to
me
is
not
very
onerous.
in
fact,
it's
less
onerous,
i
think,
than
what
happened
in
the
donovan
case,
where
what
was
left
in
effect
was
the
ruling
a
statute
was
unconstitutional
when
the
government
thought
the
statute
was
constitutional.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
not
any
different
than
that.
just
one
other
point
before
i
close,
and
that
is
the
government
made
the
comment
that
the
montana
contractors
case
was
in
effect
on
point
here.
and
i
agree
first
with
the
comment
of
justice
white
that
that
summary
affirmant
should
have
little
effect
as
a
precedent
even
if
it
were.
but
i
don't
think
it
really
is
on
point.
my
understanding
of
reading
what
happened
in
that
case
is
the
government
did
in
fact
first
appeal,
file
a
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
on
the
constitutional
question.
as
a
result,
the
plaintiffs
had
no
choice
under
1252
but
to
file
their
second
appeal
to
this
court.
i
think
we
all
agree
that
once
an
appeal
is
here
under
1252
there
is
no
choice.
the
government
then
decided
not
to
perfect
its
appeal.
the
government
never
filed
a
jurisdictional
statement.
it
dropped
its
appeal
and
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
other
party's
appeal.
they
sort
of
got
stuck
in
this
court,
and
therefore
the
court...
and
then
the
court
held
lack
of...
no
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me,
given
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
that
situation,
that
that's
really
not
a
case
that
ought
to
stand
as
precedent
for
this
situation,
which
is
far
different.
so
i
would
again
urge
this
court
to
remember
the
uniqueness
of
this
kind
of
situation.
it
doesn't
happen
very
often.
it
happens
very
rarely
and
it
does
present,
i
think,
a
situation
where
congress
wanted
this
court
to
be
the
determining
factor
of
what
was
going
to
happen
to
this
kind
of
federal
program.
thank
you.
