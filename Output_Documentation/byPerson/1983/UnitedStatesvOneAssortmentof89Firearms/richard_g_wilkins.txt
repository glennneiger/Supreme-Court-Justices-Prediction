mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
march
31,
1977
the
united
states
commenced
a
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
south
carolina
seeking
forfeiture
to
the
united
states
of
an
assortment
of
firearms
seized
on
january
20,
1977
by
special
agents
by
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms.
the
forfeiture
complaint
alleged
that
patrick
mulcahey
had
used
and
intended
to
use
the
firearms
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
while
engaged
as
a
dealer
in
firearms
without
a
license.
the
forfeiture
was
sought
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
18
u.s.c.
section
924
(d).
mr.
mulcahey
filed
a
claim
for
the
return
of
the
firearms
and
also
sought
to
raise
his
prior
acquittal
on
a
related
criminal
firearms
charge
to
bar
the
civil
forfeiture
action.
the
district
court
on
motion
of
the
government
dismissed
mr.
mulcahey's
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata
defenses
noting
that
the
criminal
acquittal
did
not
preclude
a
subsequent
civil
action.
the
parties
thereafter
submitted
by
stipulation
the
transcript
of
the
criminal
trial
to
the
court,
and
the
court
thereupon
found
that
the
government
had
shown
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
firearms
were
indeed
subject
to
forfeiture.
that
evidence
which
is
not
in
dispute
here
show
that
during
the
period
when
mr.
mulcahey
was
not
indeed
licensed
he
nevertheless
bought
and
sold
numerous
firearms
including
making
16
offers
to
sell
various
firearms.
on
appeal
a
divided
panel
of
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
finding
that
this
court's
decision
in
coffey
v.
united
states
precluded
the
section
action.
chief
judge
winter
of
that
court
dissented
reasoning
that
while
a
criminal
penalty
following
a
criminal
acquittal
was
barred
by
the
coffey
case
that
case
did
not
preclude
the
imposition
of
subsequent
civil
penalties.
on
rehearing
en
banc
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
the
panel
decision
by
a
5-4
vote.
the
majority
again
relied
on
coffey
and
rejected
the
government's
argument
that
it
was
not
applicable
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
court
also
noted
that
even
if
the
government's
interpretation
in
coffey
were
correct
this
forfeiture
action
would
nevertheless
be
precluded
because
"there
is
nothing
remedial
about
forfeiture
under
section
924(d).
"
judge
winter
joined
by
three
others
again
dissented
relying
principally
upon
his
dissent
at
the
panel
stage
although
he
also
added
that
while
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
firearms
act
reach
only
completed
violations,
the
forfeiture
provision
at
issue
here
reaches
firearms
that
are
merely
intended
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
this
he
said
evidences
congress'
intent
to
provide
a
broad
remedial
sanction.
the
question
in
this
case,
therefore,
is
whether
an
acquittal
on
criminal
gun
control
charges
precludes
a
subsequent
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
action
against
those
weapons.
this
question
can
best
be
analyzed
by
dividing
it
up
into
two
interrelated
inquiries.
first,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
forfeiture
is
indeed
civil
is
there
any
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
penalty
action
is
precluded.
this
question
is
readily
answered
by
established
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
negative.
therefore,
the
second
question
necessarily
becomes
whether
or
not
section
924(d)
is
properly
classified
as
a
civil
sanction.
this
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction
and
is
also
easily
answered
because
congress
has
clearly
indicated
its
intent
to
provide
a
civil
sanction.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
this
court's
decision
in
coffey
mandated
preclusion
here
because
the
civil
action
arose
out
of
the
same
facts
that
were
involved
in
a
prior
criminal
prosecution.
while
there
is
indeed
some
language
in
coffey
which
would
lend
support
to
this
broad
rule
of
preclusion
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
given
coffey
a
significantly
narrower
reading.
in
helvering
v.
mitchell
the
government
brought
a
civil
penalty
action
to
recover
a
$364,000
fine
for
the
fraudulent
avoidance
of
income
tax
following
the
taxpayer's
acquittal
on
criminal
charges
of
willfully
evading
the
income
tax.
the
taxpayer,
of
course,
faced
with
this
large
fine
raised
his
prior
criminal
acquittal
to
bar
the
civil
penalty
action.
the
court
of
appeals
relying
on
coffey
reversed,
but
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
justice
brande
is
reversed.
the
helvering
court
first
dispatched
the
argument
that
res
judicata
barred
the
subsequent
penalty
action.
the
court
noted
reversing
the
position
taken
in
the
coffey
court
that
the
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof
in
criminal
and
civil
cases
precludes
application
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
this
court
quite
recently
in
the
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
case
used
the
exact
same
rationale
to
dispense
with
the
argument
that
a
criminal
acquittal
collaterally
estopped
a
subsequent
civil
forfeiture
action.
the
helvering
court
also
dismissed
the
contention
that
double
jeopardy
barred
the
subsequent
action
noting
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
impose
both
civil
and
criminal
penalties
for
the
same
conduct.
finally,
it
dispensed
with
the
coffey
objection
noting
simply
that
the
rule
in
the
coffey
case
does
not
apply
when
there
has
been
a
criminal
acquittal
followed
by
a
subsequent
civil
action
requiring
a
different
degree
of
proof.
therefore,
the
crucial
question
here
is
not--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
forfeiture
action?
it
was
an
in
rem
civil
forfeiture
action,
and
the
court
said
that
this
was
nominally
a
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
action.
the
crucial
question
here,
therefore,
is
not
whether
coffey
mandates
preclusion
but
rather
whether
section
924(d)
is
properly
classified
as
a
civil
sanction.
this
court's
decisions
clearly
indicate
that
this
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
that
proceeds
on
two
levels.
first,
the
court
seeks
to
determine
whether
congress
either
expressly
or
impliedly
has
indicated
its
intent
to
apply
one
label
or
the
other;
and
second,
when
congress
has
indicated
its
intent
to
apply
a
civil
label
the
court
examines
the
particular
sanction
involved
to
see
whether
that
sanction
is
so
punitive
in
purpose
or
effect
as
to
negate
that
intention.
that
analysis
shows
that
this
sanction
here
is
civil.
perhaps
the
clearest
indication
that
this
sanction
is
indeed
civil
is
the
fact
that
congress
provided
civil
procedures
for
its
enforcement.
section
924(d)
incorporates
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
among
other
things
provide
for
notice
by
publication
and
administrative
forfeiture
if
the
goods
seized
are
valued
at
less
than
$2500.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
justice
brandeis
in
helvering
said
that
congress
may
not
provide
civil
procedures
for
the
enforcement
of
punitive
sanctions.
in
a
case
that
you
posit
where
it
was
rather
clearly
quite
a
confiscatory
sort
of
forfeiture
and
for
rather
obviously
punitive
motives
perhaps
the
court
would
say,
no
you
could
not
provide
that
sort
of--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
it
does
to
the
extent
the
question
here
is
congressional
intent
if
you
are
looking
at
what
congress
thought
they
were
doing
when
they
provided
this
forfeiture
statute.
the
fact
that
they
provided
civil
procedures
they
certainly
thought
they
were
providing
a
civil--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
intent
to
call
a
particular
sanction.
is
this
a
civil
sanction
or
is
this
a
criminal
sanction?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
no.
of
course,
as
we
said
in
the
opinion
in
ward
there
is
a
two
step
inquiry.
first
you
look
to
see
whether
congress
has
intended
it
to
be
civil
or
criminal
and
second
you
ask,
well,
is
it
so
punitive
in
purpose
or
effect
as
to
negate
that
intention.
so
there
is
a
second
level
of
inquiry,
of
course.
the
remedial
structure
of
the
act
also
indicates
that
this
is
a
broadly...
that
this
is
a
civil
sanction.
forfeiture
cannot
be
ordered
as
part
of
the
criminal
punishment
for
a
criminal
violation
of
the
gun
control
law.
forfeiture
can
be
obtained
if
at
all
only
by
bringing
a
subsequent
civil
forfeiture
action
against
the
firearms.
therefore,
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
forfeiture
is
somehow
criminal
it
would
do
quite
a
bit
of
violence
to
the
remedial
structure
of
the
act.
the
government
would
be
forced
to
choose
between
forfeiture
or
criminal
prosecution.
it
couldn't
have
both.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
term
has
had
some
limited
relevance
as
it
applies
to
certain
discrete
constitutional
rights.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
the
court's
rather
established
with
boyd
and
continuing
threw
coin
and
currency
quite
recently
would
establish
that,
but--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
in
fact
in
other
decisions
this
court
has
refused
to
apply
the
quasi-criminal
sort
of
analysis
to
apply
sixth
amendment
confrontation
rights,
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
clause,
for
example,
any
due
process
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
all
of
these
sorts
of
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
it
was
so
punitive
in
nature
and
effect
as
to
be
properly
called
a
criminal
sanction
i
would
assume
that
it
would
apply
to
the
entire
action,
but
you
noted
one
very
important
point
here.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
elements
between
the
forfeiture
actions
here
and
the
criminal
action,
and
we
believe
that
that
is
another
strong
indication
that
congress
intended
this
as
a
civil
sanction
because
it
reaches
weapons
that
are
merely
intended
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
law
whereas
the
criminal
sanction
only
applies
to
completed
actions.
finally,
although
the
court
below
said
there
was
nothing
remedial
about
forfeiture
we
believe
that
this
simply
ignores
that
broad
prophylactic
goals
of
the
gun
control
legislation
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted.
this
legislation
was
enacted
to
enable
the
states
to
control
firearms
traffic
within
their
borders,
and
elimination
of
unregulated
firearms
that
have
been
set
apart
or
intended
for
use
in
unregulated
commerce
furthers
that
remedial
purpose.
therefore,
six
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
the
position
that
forfeiture
under
this
provision
is
civil
and
remedial
in
nature,
and
the
court
below
stands
alone
in
its
characterization.
therefore,
the
court
is
required
to
take
the
second
step
adverted
to
by
justice
rehnquist,
that
is,
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
sanction
is
so
punitive
in
purpose
or
effect
as
to
negate
that
clear
intention
that
congress
indicated
to
provide
a
civil
sanction
here.
this
question
is
rather
difficult
because
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
making
it
are
somewhat
vague
an
ambiguous.
the
fact
that
a
statute
has
a
severe
subjective
impact
upon
an
individual
cannot
by
itself
suffice
to
make
a
statute
punitive
and
criminal.
the
taxpayer
in
helvering
faced
with
a
$364,000
fine
certainly
felt
punished,
yet
that
was
not
enough
to
label
that
statute
criminal
nor
is
it
enough
that
the
particular
sanction
depends
on
criminally
proscribed
conduct
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
noted
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
impose
civil
and
criminal
sanctions
for
the
same
conduct.
therefore,
the
court
has
properly
noted
the
government
believes
that
only
the
clearest
of
proof
would
suffice
to
establish
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
on
this
second
ground.
there
is
no
clear
proof
here.
to
show
that
we
would
use
some
of
the
factors
that
the
court
indicated
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case.
initially
the
declaration
of
a
forfeiture
poses
no
affirmative
disability
or
restraint
upon
a
property
owner.
the
declaration
of
the
forfeiture
does
not
render
him
criminal.
indeed
mr.
mulcahey
could
go
out
and
purchase
more
firearms.
he
is
not
subject
to
the
ownership
restrictions.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
he
is
restrained
from
using
his
property,
but
he
is
not
stigmatized
as
a
criminal.
he
is
not
thrown
in
jail.
his
liberty
in
many
traditional
senses
is--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--this
case
does
not
involve
drugs.
there
are
other--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
also
the
second
mendoza-martinez
factor
unquestionably
indicates
the
civil
nature
of
this
sanction.
in
rem
forfeiture
is
a
traditional
civil
sanction.
indeed
the
helvering
court
noted
that
forfeiture
has
been
considered
civil
since
the
original
revenue
law
of
1789
and
has
been
upheld
repeatedly
against
the
contention
that
it
is
essentially
criminal.
the
other
factors
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
them
at
any
great
length
but
they
all
indicate
to
some
degree
or
other
that
this
is
a
civil
sanction.
it
has
a
remedial
purpose.
it
does
not
require
a
showing
of
scienter.
indeed
the
only
factor
that
indicates
at
all
that
this
is
a
criminal
sanction
is
the
fact
that
it
is
based
on
some
conduct
that
is
criminalized
or
that
is
already
a
crime,
but
as
the
court
noted
in
ward
just
three
years
ago
this
indication
does
not
carry
substantial
weight
because
congress
can
indeed
criminalize
conduct
and
also
impose
a
civil
penalty
for
the
same
conduct.
in
any
event
in
this
case
forfeiture
can
be
ordered
for
conduct
that
is
not
indeed
in
violation
of
any
criminal
provision.
the
united
states
believes
that
the--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
do
not
think
you
have
to
do
anything
to
coffey
that
has
not
already
been
done
to
it?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
has
already
been
done.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
we
should
just
say
so.
justice
brandeis
did
it
in
helvering.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
just
one
or
two
responses,
justice
burger.
to
respond
to
any
contention
that
perhaps
we
are
doing
something
wrong
in
having
two
bites
at
the
apple
or
taking
an
undue
choice,
any
choice
that
was
given
the
government
was
given
by
congress.
as
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
united
states
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
case
stated
the
short
of
it
is
that
when
two
such
proceedings
merely
carry
out
remedies
which
congress
has
provided
in
advance
for
a
wrong
they
do
not
twice
put
a
man
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
congress
thereby
merely
allows
the
comprehensive
penalties
which
it
has
imposed
to
be
enforced
in
separate
suits
instead
of
in
a
single
proceeding.
moreover,
responding
to
justice
marshall's
inquiry
as
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
this
was
in
title
xviii
had
any
significance.
the
gun
control
law
in
1968--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
act
of
congress--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
fact
that
this
act
was
codified
in
title
xviii
which
is
the
criminal
title
of
the
united
states
code.
the
gun
control
act
of
1968
replaced
an
act
that
had
been
previously
codified
in
title
xv.
the
act
itself
has
many
regulatory
procedures
such
as
923
which
is
purely
a
regulatory
licensing
sort
of
a
provision.
the
fact
that
there
are
also
criminal
segments
of
this
statute
we
do
not
feel
has
any
particular
relevance,
and
as
to
the
fact
that
why
did
we
not
seek
forfeiture
first
and
would
that
not
solve
the
problem,
there
are
significant
reasons
why
we
should
not
and
we
could
not
seek
forfeiture
first.
for
example,
we
might
indeed
unduly
impinge
upon
a
property
owner's
fifth
amendment
rights.
if
he
took
the
stand
to
defend
his
right
to
keep
his
property
in
the
prior
forfeiture
action,
that
evidence
could
be
used
against
him
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
those
sorts
of
reasons
are
why
we
do
not
seek
the
forfeiture
action
first.
