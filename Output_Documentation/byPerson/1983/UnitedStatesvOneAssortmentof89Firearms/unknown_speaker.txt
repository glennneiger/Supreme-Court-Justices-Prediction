unknown
speaker
in
the
coffey
case,
mr.
wilkins,
was
the
proceeding
civil
or
criminal?
unknown
speaker
was
that
necessarily
a
very
persuasive
argument,
mr.
wilkins?
supposing
that
the
forfeiture
provision
were
extremely
stringent,
say,
you
forfeiture
$100,000
to
the
government
if
you
are
found
with
these
sort
of
weapons
on
you
and
the
government
says
"well,
to
show
it
is
civil
we
will
simply
have
all
civil
procedures.
"
"there
will
be
no
right
to
counsel
and
nothing
else
that
would
go
with
a
criminal
trial.
"
that
would
not
really
move
the
ball
much
would
it?
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
civil
procedures
had
been
provided
would
not
advance
the
argument
that
it
was
a
civil
rather
than
a
criminal
penalty.
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
the
intent
of
congress
that
we
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
congress
simply
by
intending
to
make
this
civil
can
make
civil
what
otherwise
would
not
be?
unknown
speaker
sometimes,
mr.
wilkins,
we
see
the
term
"quasi-criminal"
apply
to
these
forfeiture
proceedings.
does
that
have
any
relevance?
unknown
speaker
for
instance,
would
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
apply
perhaps
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
is
one
of
those
that
might
be
characterized
as
quasi?
unknown
speaker
but
not
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
if
the
statute
in
a
given
forfeiture
statute
were
characterized
as
criminal
as
being
punitive
in
nature
and
not
remedial
would
double
jeopardy
apply
to
all
elements
even
though
some
of
the
elements
of
the
civil
offense...
the
forfeiture
offense
were
different
from
the
criminal?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
restrained
from
using
his
property.
unknown
speaker
his
property
is
being
taken
from
him
only
because
he's
been
using
it
to
transport
drugs.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
others
do.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
unknown
speaker
supposing
we
agree
with
everything
you
say,
but
we
are
still
troubled
by
the
fact
that
we
may
find
ourselves
confronting
coffey
and
feel
we
have
to
overrule
coffey
explicitly
to
decide
in
your
favor
how
strong
are
the
stare
decicis
interests
in
this
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position
it
has
already
been
overruled?
unknown
speaker
we
should
just
say
so.
unknown
speaker
the
same
burden
of
proof
present?
unknown
speaker
well,
accused
in
the
criminal
case
selling
firearms
without
a
license.
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
found
guilty
of
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the
evidence
apparently
according
to
the
government
is
sufficient
to
establish
that
he
intended
to
do
it.
his
defense
in
the
criminal
case
was
entrapment,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
what
came
out
was
he
intended
to
sell
them
all
right
without
a
license.
why
is
it
not
remedial
to
say
that
the
guns
can
be
forfeited?
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
have
to
prove
intent
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
did
you
refer
to
the
requirement
that
they
be
intended
to
be
used?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
if
there
is
a
criminal
case
and
a
conviction
is
there
then
a
separate
forfeiture
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
they
have
to
file
a
separate
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
could
you
not
if
you
take
the
position
that
that
is
also
a
criminal
proceeding
why
could
you
not
say
that
he
had
been
punished
once
for
the
crime
and
it
is
the
same
crime
so
you
do
not
have
to
forfeit?
unknown
speaker
is
that
statute
constitutional
if
they
are
both
criminal
proceedings?
could
you
have
a
statute
saying
if
you
commit
a
murder
you
should
be
tried
and
convicted
and
should
be
sentenced
to
so
many
years
in
jail
and
if
the
government
elects
to
come
back
in
and
try
you
all
over
again
and
have
a
second
sentence?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
not
what
you
are
saying
this
is?
unknown
speaker
do
you
put
any
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
forfeiture
is
in
a
criminal
statute?
unknown
speaker
it
is
in
the
criminal
statute?
unknown
speaker
had
the
government
originally
gone
after
the
forfeiture
and
not
the
criminal
you
would
not
be
here?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
value
of
these
firearms?
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
had
both,
of
course,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
say
title
xviii.
i
said
the
act
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next,
the
5th
of
december
at
10:00.
