mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
criminal
action
alleged
in
the
indictment
the
identical
elements
which
were
alleged
in
the
forfeiture
case,
hence,
the
same
issues
were
raised
in
both
cases.
the
same
facts
were
present.
the
government
had
its
day
in
court.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
no,
sir,
and
different
burden
of
proof,
and
i
will
get
to
that
a
little
later.
but
coffey
says
and
i
content
that
coffey
has
not
been
overruled
that
where
the
same
facts,
the
same
acts,
the
same
elements
have
been
put
at
issue
and
resolved
against
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
the
government
cannot
later
adopt
a
label,
call
it
a
civil
case,
put
the
same
facts
in
evidence
and
issue
and
have
its
second
bite
at
the
apple.
i
think
that
is
the
clear
out
issue
here.
coffey
i
say
i
believe
has
a
very
narrow
preclusion
doctrine.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
broad
doctrine
at
all.
i
do
not
think
it
encompasses
helvering.
i
do
not
think
it
encompasses
ward.
i
do
not
think
it
is
included
in
the
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
case,
and
i
think
each
of
these
can
be
distinguished.
a
careful
analysis
of
coffey
i
believe
establishes
the
reasoning
of
that
court
being
not
res
judicata
and
not
even
double
jeopardy
but
collateral
estoppel.
the
same
issues
cannot
be
determined
twice
after
having
been
determined
once.
it
does
not
apply
to
a
civil
action
after
a
conviction.
of
course,
that
is
an
entirely
different
case.
certainly
after
conviction
of
a
violation
of
the
fireams
act
in
this
case
the
government
could
have
forfeited
the
firearms.
it
does
not...
coffey
does
not
apply
to
a
subsequent
civil
action
where
the
issues
are
different.
but
mulcahey
was
charged
with
engaging
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license
in
the
criminal
case.
he
was
put
to
trial
and
acquitted.
in
the
forfeiture
case
the
firearms
were
charged
with
being
used
or
having
been
intended
for
use
by
mulcahey
because
he
did
not
have
a
license
to
deal
in
firearms,
identical
issues.
the
government
has
in
its
brief
relied
a
great
deal
on
stone
as
saying
that
this
can
be
allowed
because
in
stone
there
was
a
criminal
acquittal
and
a
later
civil
action,
but
in
stone
the
civil
action
was
brought
by
the
government
as
the
owner
of
the
properties.
some
timber
was
cut
by
stone
on
government
land.
he
was
charged
with
feloniously
cutting
the
timber,
and
he
was
acquitted.
in
the
criminal
case...
excuse
me,
in
the
civil
case
then
the
government
as
owner
of
the
property
brought
an
action
to
recover
the
value
of
the
timber.
hence,
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
status
of
the
government
in
both
cases.
the
helvering
case
on
which
the
government
relies
is
vastly
different
from
coffey.
helvering
did
not
involve
a
forfeiture.
helvering
involved
a
civil
penalty,
a
50
percent
tax
penalty,
and
the
court
was
very
careful
to
say...
it
distinguished
coffey...
it
was
very
careful
to
say
this
is
a
civil
administrative
remedial
sanction.
now
we
contend
that
there
is
nothing
civil
or
administrative
and
certainly
not
remedial
about
taking
firearms.
in
the
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
case
the
individual
on
trial
in
the
criminal
case
was
charged
with
willfully,
intentionally,
knowingly
smuggling
into
the
united
states
certain
contraband
items,
stones
and
a
ring.
later
forfeiture
of
the
contraband
smuggled
goods
was
allowed
after
the
individual
was
acquitted,
but
the
reason
for
it
and
the
court
was
very
careful
in
discussing
coffey
and
boyd
and
all
of
the
other
cases
that
went
on
and
which
had
not
been
overruled.
the
reason
was
that
intent
was
not
an
element
in
the
forfeiture
of
the
contraband
items.
intent
was
an
element
in
the
criminal
case.
i
think
we
need
to
pause
here
for
a
moment
and
think
about
the
nature
of
the
goods
forfeited
in
mulcahey's
case,
in
this
case.
none
of
these
firearms
were
contraband.
none
of
these
firearms
were
illegal
per
se.
there
was
not
an
illegal
automatic
weapon.
there
was
not
a
sawed
off
shotgun.
there
was
nothing
illegal
about
the
guns.
the
only
contention
that
the
government
had
in
either
case
was
that
they
were
being
used
by
an
individual
who
they
claim
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license
in
both
cases.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
yes.
that
was
one
of
the
defenses.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
i
think
that
can
be
answered
on
two
grounds.
one
is
in
united
states
v.
united
states
coin
and
currency
which
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief.
that
issue
was
addressed,
and
if
you
recall
in
that
case
some
gambling
proceeds
were
taken
and
the
court
said
that
you
cannot
take
things
simply
because
they
are
intended
or
there
is
some
suggestion
that
they
are
intended
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
now
the
statute
does
allow
that
here.
but
i
contend
that
that
furthers
our
argument
that
this
924(d)
is
punitive.
it
expands
the
punitive
nature
of
the
statute.
for
example,
a
firearm
used
in
a
criminal
act...
924(d)
refers
to
the
gun
control
act
or
any
other
criminal
sanction,
criminal
law
of
the
united
states.
a
typical
case
would
be
a
person
committing
a
felony
with
a
firearm.
certainly
the
firearm
can
be
forfeited,
but
you
expand
the
punitive
aspect
of
it
when
you
say
that
any
gun
intended
to
be
used.
that
weakens
the
government's
argument
that
this
is
not
punitive.
if
you
sell
one
gun
without
a
license
it
is
forfeited.
if
you
sell
one
gun
without
a
license
and
you
have
50
guns
in
your
garage
or
your
basement
or
your
shop
then
the
government
can
say
since
these
guns
were
here
they
were
intended
to
be
used
so
we'll
take
all
of
them.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
no,
sir.
in
either
case
they
do
not
have
to
approve
intent.
intent
is
not
an
element
of
the
criminal
case
in
this
particular
statute
either.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
it
was
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
the
court
affirmed
coffey
in
one
lot
case
and
it
discussed
coffey
explicitly.
it
said
that
collateral
estoppel
in
one
lot
emerald
cut
stones
would
bar
a
forfeiture
if
in
the
earlier
criminal
proceeding
the
elements
of
the
forfeiture
had
been
resolved
against
the
government.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
mulcahey's
case.
the
elements
were
resolved
against
the
government.
coffey
did
address
the
burden
of
proof
issue
specifically
and
answered
it.
it
says
that
the
government
urges
that
the
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof
in
civil
versus
criminal
cases
should
be
something
to
distinguish
the
two
cases,
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
nevertheless
the
fact
or
act
has
been
at
issue
and
determined
against
the
united
states
and
all
that
is
imposed
by
the
statute
as
a
consequence
of
guilt
is
a
punishment.
there
could
be
no
new
trial
of
the
criminal
prosecution
after
the
acquittal.
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
held
in
this
case.
the
fourth
circuit
said
in
the
majority
opinion
that
everything
in
924(d)
is
punitive.
it
provides
for
imprisonment
of
up
to
five
years,
a
fine
of
up
to
$5000
or
both,
and
a
forfeiture
of
firearms
used
in
violation
of
that
law
or
any
other
law
of
the
united
states.
so
i
believe
what
you
have
is
the
government
making
a
choice.
trying
the
criminal
case,
if
they
win
it
the
defendant
goes
to
jail.
he
pays
a
fine.
he
loses
his
firearms.
if
they
lose
it
under
the
position
of
the
government
he
does
not
go
to
jail.
he
does
not
pay
a
fine,
but
in
a
separate
case
they
can
still
take
his
firearms
for
the
same
reason,
the
same
acts,
the
same
elements
that
they
failed
to
prove
the
first
time.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
the
mechanics
are
separate,
but
it
is
automatic.
it
says
that
upon--
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
--yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
because
i
think
the
careful
reading
of
the
statute
specifically
allows
the
government
to
do
that.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question--
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
--no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
they
can
do
that?
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
under
924(d)
the
government
can
take
the
firearms
after
a
conviction.
i
am
saying
that
under
924(d)
conceivably
the
government
could
bring
a
civil
forfeiture
with
no
preceding
criminal
case,
but
once
having
elected
in
the
beginning
to
assert
the
criminal
statute...
now
remember
this
is
a
little
different
criminal
statute.
this
is
not
the
ordinary
statute
of
smuggling
or
dealing
in
drugs
or
carrying
contraband
around.
this
statute
just
charges
a
man
with
no
intent
requirement
of
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license.
that
is
all.
they
have
done
it
twice.
as
a
second
part
of
our
argument
we
contend
that
if
the
court
decides
that
coffey
is
overruled
then
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
that
924(d)
is
definitely
punitive
for
the
following
reasons.
boyd
stated
that
even
though
a
case
may
be
civil
in
form
it
may
be
criminal
in
effect
or
punitive
in
effect,
and
the
nature
of
it
could
be
criminal.
now
much
has
been
said
by
the
government
about
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
procedures
are
set
up
for
the
mechanics
of
the
forfeiture.
well,
boyd
says
that
does
not
make
any
difference.
the
mechanics
are
not
important.
it
is
the
result.
it
is
the
effect.
the
effect
is
that
a
person
is
having
his
property
taken
from
him,
and
then
the
question
is
is
that
punishment.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
yes,
sir.
all
of
it
is
in
section
924.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
very
important
to
show
congressional
intent
that
it
is
labeled
penalty.
this
particular
section
is
labeled
penalty.
that
can
to
me
only
mean
punitives,
what
it
says.
it
was
all
enacted
at
one
time.
it
was
not
added
later
as
the
case
was
in
ward
where
some
70
years
later
the
civil
sanction--
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
--exactly.
we
think
that
this
case
insofar
as
a
measure
of
the
punitive
aspects
of
a
forfeiture
does
fit
the
requirements
of
kennedy
v.
mendoza-martinez.
we
think
that
it
is
an
effective
affirmative
disability
or
restraint.
the
individual
who
owned
these
guns
will
not
have
them
any
longer.
it
is
a
taking
of
his
property.
we
think
it
does
stigmatize
his
reputation.
he
went
to
trial
in
criminal
court
and
came
out
acquitted.
he
goes
back
and
the
government
takes
his
firearms.
we
think
that
is
a
stigma.
we
believe
that
this
sanction
has
been
historically
regarded
as
punishment,
another
one
of
the
tests
of
mendoza-martinez.
it
is
clearly
to
further
the
deterrent
and
punitive
purposes
and
to
impose
an
economic
penalty.
when
you
take
a
man's
lifelong
gun
collection
from
him...
this
man
had
been
collecting
these
firearms
since
he
was,
i
think,
14
years
old--
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
--the
value
is
in
dispute.
the
government
alleged
in
the
forfeiture
complaint
a
little
over
$5000.
our
answer
alleged
approximately
$15,000.
i
do
not
think
that
became
terribly
important
if
they
took
all
of
them,
but
we
contend
that
at
the
time...
that
was
back
in
1977...
they
were
worth
$15,000
and
assuming
they
have
been
taken
care
of
would
be
worth
substantially
more
today.
we
think
that
the
sanction
does
further
retribution
and
deterrence
and
certainly
this
forfeiture
arose
out
of
an
underlying
criminal
act
so
the
act
alleged
was
already
a
crime.
can
an
alternative
purpose
be
assigned
to
this
sanction?
i
have
answered
that.
the
firearms
were
a
collection
of
a
lifetime.
the
congressional
findings
and
intent
i
think
is
important,
too,
and
is
recited
in
our
brief.
it
states
that
the
purpose
of
all
the
gun
control
act
was
not
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
law
abiding
citizens
to
use
and
enjoy
firearms.
it
was
very
clear
to
enunciate
that,
and
we
believe
that
taking
a
person
who
has
been
adjudged
in
effect
a
law
abiding
citizen
by
a
jury
of
12
people,
take
his
firearms
certainly
takes
care
of
that
requirement.
then
the
excessiveness
of
the
sanction.
i
think
we
have
already
answered
that
by
asking
about
the
value.
the
maximum
fine
he
could
have
been
assessed
had
he
been
found
guilty
would
have
been
$5000.
having
failed
in
that
he
now
faces
a
forfeiture
of
even
by
the
government's
own
allegation
of
a
value
of
more
than
$5000.
mr.
herbert
w.
louthian
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
case
has
serious
public
policy
ramifications.
the
case
of
partman
corporation
v.
paramount
pictures
talked
about
collateral
estoppel
by
by
a
judgment
and
said
this
doctrine
was
established
as
a
procedure
for
carrying
out
the
public
policy
of
avoiding
a
repetitious
litigation.
well,
if
the
government
prevails
here
i
think
we
are
going
to
open
the
door
to
repetitious
litigation
by
having
happen
to
other
citizens
what
has
happened
to
mulcahey,
having
been
tried,
acquitted
and
then
having
to
face
the
civil
forfeiture
based
on
the
same
charge.
we
contend
that
the
holding
in
coffey
is
still
good
law;
that
924(d)
is
punitive;
that
the
government
had
its
one
bite
at
the
apple;
they
should
be
precluded
from
bringing
this
action
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
