unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
is
it
so
much
a
conflict
between
two
statutes
as
a
problem
of
executory
contracts
of
a
different
character,
one
with
a
supplier,
perhaps,
and
one
with
an
employee?
is
that
really
conflict
in
the
statutes?
unknown
speaker
how
did
congress
indicate
that
awareness?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
is
it
you
rely
on
to
say
that
they
implicitly
ratified
a
court
of
appeals
decision?
unknown
speaker
now,
wait
a
minute,
mr.
wallace.
is
there
any
general
principle
that
congress
is
presumed
to
be
aware
of
every
district
court,
every
court
of
appeals
decision,
or
every
decision
of
this
court,
however
episodic
it
may
be?
unknown
speaker
we
really
have
three
separate
standards
expressed
by
the
courts
of
appeals,
don't
we,
this
one,
the
nigra
case,
and
the
eleventh,
and--
unknown
speaker
--whatever...
brada
miller.
unknown
speaker
and
you
go
for
the
allowance
standard
way
back
by
judge
moore
a
number
of
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
if
it
is
legitimate
for
a
company
to
file
a
bankruptcy
petition
because
executory
contracts
are
making
successful
continuation
of
the
business
impossible,
is
it
permissible
for
a
company
to
file
a
bankruptcy
petition
for
the
express
purpose
of
freeing
itself
from
an
executory
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
it
feels
is
making
it
impossible?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
at
one
page
in
your
brief,
you
state
that
ca2
standard
was...
that
a
showing
of
will
fail
must
be
made
by
the
debtor.
on
the
next
page,
you
use
the
term
"likely
to
fail".
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
not
really?
unknown
speaker
you
think,
though,
that
they
must
comply
literally
with
all
the
requirements
of
8(d)?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
is
the
issue,
8(d)
or
not?
unknown
speaker
or
just
notice
and
reasonable
amount
of
bargaining?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
don't
have
to...
you
know,
a
lot
of
bargaining
goes
on
for
a
long
time,
and
if
it
is
going
to
go
on
for
a
long
time,
the
company
may...
you
may
not
have
to
bargain
any
more.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
gather,
mr.
zazzali,
you
would
require
them
to
bargain
to
impasse,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
that
can
be
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
position
is,
they
must
bargain
to
impasse
before
the
debtor
in
possession
may
seek
rejection.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
achieved
in
six
months,
too.
two
years.
unknown
speaker
if
the
union
has
notice,
and
surely
it
would,
of
an
application
to
reject
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
union
could
certainly
participate
in
the
hearing,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be.
it
may
be.
but
what
if
the...
what
if
the...
what
if
the
standard
is
as
high
as
you
would
like
it
to
be,
the
standard
for
rejection?
you
can...
you
can
assume
that
standard,
and
if
the
union
can
get
in
its
two
bits
worth
as
to
whether
that
standard
is
satisfied,
why
aren't...
why
isn't
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
because
if
the
court
were
going
to
conclude
that,
yes,
the
company
would
or
would
be
likely
to
fail
unless
there
were
modifications,
why
would
you
have
to
go
off
and
negotiate
some
more
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
requirement,
does
that
suggest
that
even
if
they
arrived
at
an
agreement,
even
if
they
did,
the
bankruptcy
court
could
still
perhaps
even
sui
sponte
direct
rejection?
unknown
speaker
the
court,
in
other
words,
would
not
be
concluded
by
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
they
would
in
a
sense
be
negotiating
before
the
bankruptcy
court--
unknown
speaker
--with
somebody
there
refereeing
the
struggle.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
if
the
bankruptcy
court...
say
the
bankruptcy
court
accepted
everything
you
suggest.
they
reach
impasse,
and
then
the
bankruptcy
court
holds
that
the
contract
must
be
rejected,
or
may
be
rejected?
what
then?
what
is
your
view
of
the
relationship
between
the
trustee
or
the
debtor
in
possession
and
the
union?
are
there
then
negotiations?
unknown
speaker
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but...
the
collective
bargaining
contract
has
been
rejected,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
represent
the
majority
of
the
employees,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position?
on
the
60-day
notice
requirement,
section
8(d),
do
you
say
that
applies
or
does
not
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
i
think
what
you
are
saying
is,
no,
it
doesn't
apply.
it
may
be--
unknown
speaker
--it
may
be
excused
in
certain
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
are
saying,
a
court
does
not
have
to
apply
the
60-day
notice
requirement
in
all
cases?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me,
then,
that
you
are
really
not
arguing
that
8(d)
applies,
but
rather,
that
you
are
arguing
that
the
extent
to
which
there
has
been
pretermination
negotiation
and
notice
and
bargaining
is
a
part
of
a
standard
that
should
be
applied
by
the
bankruptcy
judge
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
approve
rejection.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
per
se
requirement
that
requires
a
modest
rewriting
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
court
below
really
held
that
the
trustee
or
the
debtor
in
possession
was
a
separate
entity.
unknown
speaker
and
you
haven't
addressed
that.
if
we
agree
to
them,
all
the
rest
of
this
is
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
haven't
yet.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
that
was
the
ground
for
the
court
of
appeals
judgment,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
commentators,
mr.
zazzali,
who
are
you
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
was
that
an
article,
or
was
it
written
by
students?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
michigan
law
review?
unknown
speaker
you
commend
it
to
us
anyway?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
any
diminution
of
the
right
to
strike
if
the
contract
is
cancelled
by
the
bankruptcy
process?
unknown
speaker
they
are
just
where
they
were
before
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
are
where
they
were
before
the
contract
was
entered
into,
they
were...
they
represented
a
majority
of
the
employees,
then
i
suppose
they
could
get
an
order
to
bargain.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is...
this
is
after
rejection.
suppose
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
this
is
to
be
treated
as
a
separate
entity,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
separate
entity
doesn't
have
to
bargain
once
the
contract's
been
rejected.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
debtor
in
possession
refused
to
bargain
with
the
majority
representative
of
its
employees,
i
would
suppose
it
would
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
this
is
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question...
if
the
sole
purpose
of
a
bankruptcy
petition
was
to
escape
a
labor
contract
which
the
company
honestly
believed
would
cause
bankruptcy,
cause
insolvency
and
a
failure,
is
that
bad
faith?
unknown
speaker
what
is
bad
faith?
unknown
speaker
but
what
does
the
concept
of
bad
faith
embody,
then,
insofar
as
it
is
related
to
labor
relations?
unknown
speaker
then
they
wouldn't
be
bankrupt.
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
use
chapter
11,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
normally,
without
the
union
being
involved,
if
you
aren't
broke,
you
can't
use
chapter
11.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
something
over
and
above
the
good
faith
requirement
that
extends
across
the
board
to
consideration
of
executory
contracts
by
the
debtor
in
possession
that
applies
to
labor
contracts
in
particular,
or
is
a
labor
contract
protected
by
no
more
than
the
requirement
of
good
faith
that
you
have
just
spoken
of,
which
i
think
extends
across
the
board
in
executory
contracts?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
one
looks
at
the
national
labor
relations
act,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
thought
an
employee
was
going
into
bankruptcy
at
midterm
and
rejecting
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
was
that
because
common
carriers'
responsibilities
to
the
public
as
a
whole
are
different
from
perhaps
a
building
contractor?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
so
much
a
question
of
the
employees
being
protected
as
the
traveling
public
being
protected--
unknown
speaker
--by
continued
service.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zackin,
what
in
your
view
is
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
act
itself?
is
it
basically
there
to
try
to
protect
creditors,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
to
what
end?
to
protect
the
creditors,
or
to
protect
employees,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
defend...
you
do
defend
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
eleventh
circuit
standard
is
for
rejection?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
same
of
the
second
circuit
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
second
circuit
standard,
which
would
either
require
a
showing
at
the
threshold
that
you
will
fail
or
you
are
likely
to
fail...
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
under
that
standard,
how
do
you
understand
it?
would...
suppose
it
were
clear
that
if
you
rejected
ten
other
executory
contracts,
you
could
then
survive
and
still
pay
the
wage
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
do
you
think
in
that...
under
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
standard
that
you
have
to
prefer
the
collective
bargaining
contract
as
compared
with
all
other
burdens?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
inconsistent
with
the
second
circuit
standard
if
the
court
said,
well,
this
company
is
going
to
fail
unless
something
is
done
about
its
executory
contracts?
now,
we
are
going
to
make
everyone
share
the
burden.
we
are
going
to
reject
the
labor
contract
along
with
the
others.
is
that
inconsistent
with
the
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
inconsistent
with
the
eleventh
circuit
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
preference
isn't
an
outright
affirmance,
but
your
next
vote
is
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
it
is
a
new
entity,
why
is
there
any
need
for
rejection?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
there
isn't
any
theory
under
the
labor
law,
is
there?
if
it
is
a
new
entity,
there
isn't
any
collective
bargaining
contract
to
be
lived
up
to
anyway.
unknown
speaker
is
there?
unknown
speaker
strictly
under
labor
law?
unknown
speaker
something
like
the
successor
entity
theory
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it
is
not
a
new
entity
theory,
is
it?
it
is
just
a
successor
entity
theory.
unknown
speaker
which
wouldn't
really
be
bound
then
by
8(d),
if
it
is
just
a
successor
entity
rather
than
a
separate
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
have
the
new
entity
theory
in
order
to
be
able
to
make
changes
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
without
getting
in
trouble
with
the
labor
board,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
close,
though,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
and
this
is
prompted
by
mr.
wallace's
closing
remarks,
what
standard
applies
to
the
compensation
of
the
employees
during
that
interval?
what
frame
of
reference
should
govern?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
the
contracts,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
strong
evidence
of
the
reasonable
value?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
there
be
any
room
for
any
bargaining
over
what
is
reasonable
value
under
your
approach?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
hiatus
that
would
occur
as
here?
suppose
the
hiatus
between
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
and
the
determination
on
the
contract
was
several
months.
what
kind
of
a
paycheck
is
going
to
be
issued
to
these
men?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
employer
meanwhile
has
the
right
unilaterally
to
lower
the
wages.
unknown
speaker
but
ordinarily,
outside
of
bankruptcy,
a
successor
employer
can't
unilaterally
modify
the
wages.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zackin,
how
many
employees
does
the
debtor
now
have?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed,
there
were
three?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
there
were
18?
unknown
speaker
is
the
company
still
operating?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zackin,
going
back
to
the
standard
again
that
should
be
employed,
does
it
make
any
sense
in
your
view
for
the
court
to
consider
requiring
whatever
the
proof
be
to
be
made
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
is
an
evidentiary
standard
that
is
a
little
tougher
an
appropriate
thing
to
consider?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zackin,
do
courts
in
trying
to
treat
the
relationships
between
another
executory
contractor
whose
contract
has
been
rejected
or
accepted
go
into
elaborate
analysis
about
whether
the
debtor
in
possession
is
a
new
entity?
unknown
speaker
for
analytical
purposes,
which
should
the
debtor
in
possession
be
treated
any
differently
if
it
is
a
collective
bargaining
contract
that
has
been
rejected
than
if
it
is
an
executory
contract
to
supply
widgets
that
has
been
rejected?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zackin,
on
this
new
entity
point,
one,
the
employees,
and
two,
the
union,
what
happens
to
that
entity
once
you
go
into
bankruptcy,
chapter
11,
i
mean?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
contract?
unknown
speaker
the
payment
is
suspended.
unknown
speaker
the
payment
is
suspended.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
for
most
employees,
payment
of
wages
is
rather
important.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
he
could
also
bargain
for
a
new
contract.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
old
contract
goes
out
ahead
of
time?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
was...
the
petition
for
reorganization,
i
gather,
was
approved?
unknown
speaker
and
under
the
new
bankruptcy
law,
i
suppose,
you
still
have
to
make
a
showing
under
chapter
11
like
you
did
under
chapter
10,
that
you
cannot...
at
least
that
you
cannot
pay
your
debts
as
they
mature?
unknown
speaker
there
was,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
under
chapter
10.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
have
to
make
any
showing
that
you
are
in
financial
trouble?
unknown
speaker
about
what?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know...
what
is
the
standard
for
a
failing
business?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
showing
like
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
a...
if
you
can't
pay
your
debts
as
they
mature,
i
suppose
that
means
all
your
debts.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
wallace,
doesn't
the
bankruptcy
act,
section
365(g)(1),
if
an
executory
contract
is
rejected,
expressly
provide
that
then
it
will
relate
back
to
the
date
of
filing
of
the
petition,
so
technically
perhaps--
unknown
speaker
--the
court
is
not--
