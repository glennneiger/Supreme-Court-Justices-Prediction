mr.
jack
m.
zackin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
although
it
may
be
somewhat
unusual,
i
think
it
appropriate
to
begin
with
a
discussion
of
what
this
case
is
not
about.
first,
this
case
does
not
concern
the
issue
of
whether
a
financially
healthy
company
should
be
or
will
be
permitted
to
utilize
the
provisions
of
chapter
11
for
the
sole
purpose
of
escaping
from
a
union
contract.
such
a
factual
setting
and
motivation
have
never
been
alleged
in
this
case,
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
record
that
this
was
bildisco's
situation
or
motivation.
in
addition,
the
balancing
of
the
equities
test
formulated
by
the
third
circuit
will
itself
prevent
this
result.
under
this
test,
the
bankruptcy
court
is
required
to
scrutinize
the
good
or
bad
faith
of
the
debtor
who
seeks
to
reject
a
labor
contract.
moreover,
if
a
company
is
not
truly
financially
distressed,
the
equities
will
undoubtedly
tip
in
favor
of
the
union,
and
rejection
will
not
be
permitted.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
bad
faith,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
do
not
think
it
is
bad
faith.
i
think--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
that
if
it
is
found
by
a
bankruptcy
court
that
a
company
can
continue
to
pay
its
obligations
as
they
become
due
and
still
honor
its
union
contract,
but
nevertheless--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--well,
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
and
if
they
tried
to
use
chapter
11
merely
to
increase
their
profits
by
rejecting
the
union
contract,
that
would
constitute
bad
faith,
and
i
think
in
that
situation
not
only
would
the
application
to
reject
the
contract
be
denied,
but
the
case
itself,
the
chapter
11
case,
should
be
thrown
out
of
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
you
should
not
be
permitted
to
use
chapter
11.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
an
implicit
good
faith
requirement
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
believe
that
it
does
extend
across
the
board,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
specific
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code
itself,
there
is
certainly
no
indication
that
congress
intended
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
be
treated
differently
than
any
other
executory
contract.
i
think
that
what
the
third
circuit
recognized
was
that
there
are
competing
policies,
as
expressed
in
the
national
labor
laws,
and
that
in
order
to
accommodate
those
policies,
a
special
standard
should
be
adopted
so
that
the
rights
of
organized
labor
enjoy
a
special
status.
but
if
one
looks
strictly
at
the
letter
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
that
was
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
congress
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code
did
provide
for
one
specific
exception
with
respect
to
the
rejection
of
labor
agreements,
and
that
is
section
1167
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
applies
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
negotiated
under
the
railway
labor
act,
and
in
that
case
congress
saw
fit
to
say
to
the
bankruptcy
courts,
you
may
not,
you
may
not
modify
or
terminate
this
contract
except
if
the
debtor
complies
with
the
midterm
modification
requirements
in
the
railway
labor
act.
they
didn't
do
that
in
the
case
of
contracts
negotiated
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that's
correct,
chief
justice.
i
think
that
congress
recognized
that
there
are
different
considerations
with
respect
to
carriers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
and
those
employees
perhaps
deserve
a
bit
more
protection
than
employees
in
certain
other
industries.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that's--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
that's
true.
i
think
there
is
a
long
history
of
legislation
with
respect
to
public
transportation
and
common
carriers,
and
section
1167
is
merely
an
outgrowth
of
that,
recognizing
that
there
are
special
situations
which
apply
to
that
industry.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
the
underlying
purpose
of
at
least
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
act
as
expressed
by
congress
is
to
promote
the
reorganization
of
distressed
business
entities
as
an
alternative
to
liquidation,
and
that
policy
is
found--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--all...
both,
and...
both,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
congress
recognized
that
if
rehabilitated,
a
business
can,
number
one,
continue
to
provide
its
employees
with
jobs,
number
two,
pay
its
creditors
at
least
something
on
the
dollar,
and
number
three,
provide
a
return
to
its
investors,
its
shareholders,
whereas
if
a
business
is
liquidated
in
chapter
7
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
statistics
show
that
none
of
those
eventualities
is
likely
to
result.
certainly
the
employees
will
be
without
jobs.
creditors
are
likely
to
receive
very
little,
if
any,
any
dividend,
and
shareholders'
interests
are
obviously
expunged.
so,
i
think
there
is
a
broad
public
policy
behind
the
bankruptcy
code
that
involves
all
the
interests,
and
i
think
that
what
the
third
circuit
did
was
recognize
that
public
policy,
and
decide
that
it
was
improper
to
adopt
the
standards
espoused
by
the
union
which--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
very
definitely
defend
that
theory,
and
both
based
on
the
new
entity
theory,
which
was
discussed,
and
also,
even
if
one
rejects
that
theory,
i
think
as
the
eleventh
circuit
did
in
brada
miller,
one
still
can
reach
precisely
the
same
conclusions
as
the
third
circuit.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit
standard
is
very
similar
if
not
identical
to
the
standard
that
the
court
below
voiced.
that
is,
that
it
is
a
balancing
of
the
equities,
that
the
test
voiced
by
the
union
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
simply
in
derogation
of
the
rights
of
creditors
and
shareholders
and
even
non-union
employees.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
no,
i
think
the
second
circuit
standard
is
different.
i
think
the
second
circuit
has
basically
adopted
the
standard
which
the
union
and
the
board--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--yes.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
that
is
precisely
the
way
i
read
the
second
circuit
standard,
and
precisely
what
i
believe
that
the
petitioners
here
are
urging
to
this
court.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
if
the
second
circuit--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
that
would
be
more
consistent
with
the
eleventh
circuit
standard.
i
think
what
the
second
circuit
standard
leads
to
is
the
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
and
the
bankruptcy
court
to
sacrifice
everybody
else's
rights,
whether
they
be
creditors,
non-union
employees,
or
shareholders,
if
those
rights
are
sacrificed
and
the
debtor
can
continue
to
adhere
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
think
that
it
elevates
collective
bargaining
rights
to
that
dominant
position,
and
i
don't
think
that...
that's
certainly
not
what
the
eleventh
circuit
did,
certainly
not
what
the
third
circuit
did.
i
think
that...
they...
it
is
truly
a
balancing
approach
that
those
circuits
took,
where
one
must
weigh
the
competing
interests
of
all
the
parties
involved
in
a
reorganization
proceeding
and
determine
whether
the
benefit
stemming
from
rejection
of
a
labor
agreement
to
the
debtor
overall
and
its
creditors
and
shareholders
outweighs
the
harm
to
employees.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
it
is
interesting
what
the...
as
i
read
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
in
brada
miller,
they
began
with
a
criticism
of
the
so-called
new
entity
theory,
but
they
wound
up
adopting,
as
i
read
it,
almost
verbatim
the
test
espoused
by
the...
or
formulated
by
the
third
circuit,
which
is
the
balancing
approach,
as
well
as
the
third
circuit's
conclusion
that
a
debtor
in
possession
need
not
comply
with
section
8(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
think
they
got
to
the
same
place.
they
just
approached
it
by
different...
by
a
different
street.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
well,
i
think
the
reason
is
that
that's
the
scheme
that
congress
has
set
up.
i
think
what
congress
did
was
to
provide--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--well,
there
is
still--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--yes,
there
is.
i
think
there
is.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
there...
the
pre-bankruptcy
contract
continues
to
survive.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
that's
a
very
apt
analogy
which
has
been
made
by
several
of
the
circuits.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
as
i
read...
as
i
read--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--the
reason
that
a
new
entity
is
still
required
to
reject
or
assume
a
contract
even
though
it
is
not
a
party
to
the
contract
is
because
section
365
requires
that
debtors
in
possession
take
that
action.
i
think
what
365
stands
for
is,
and
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
is
that
the
filing
of
a
chapter
11
petition
doesn't
terminate
a
contract.
it
suspends
the
enforcement
of
the
contract.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
not
necessarily.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
it
would
certainly
help.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
but
what
the
third
circuit
also
said,
and
which
we
also
agree
with,
is
that
once
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
rejected,
the
rejection
relates
back
to
the
date
on
which
the
chapter
11
petition
was
filed,
so
that
in
our
case,
we
obtained
bankruptcy
court
permission
to
reject
in
december.
the
case
had
been
filed
the
previous
april.
what
the
third
circuit
said
was
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
then
precluded
from
finding
that
any
changes
be
made
in
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
from
that
april
to
december
date,
because
there
was
simply
no
contract.
it
had
been
terminated
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
date
of
the
filing.
we
think
that's
correct.
we
think
that
section
365(g)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
mandates
that
result.
it
clearly
provides
that
once
a...
any
executory
contract
is
rejected,
the
rejection
is
deemed
a
breach
as
of
the
date
immediately
prior
to
the
date
of
the
petition,
so
that--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
that
if
the
contract
is
rejected,
then
the
employees
are
entitled
to
the
reasonable
value
of
their
services
which
they
render
in
that
interim
period,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
a
difficult
calculation
to
make.
i
think
the
courts
can
look
to
what
the
standards
in
that
industry
are
in
the
particular
geographical
area
and
determine
what
were
the
reasonable
value
of
the
services
provided
by
those
employees,
and
if
they
have
not
been
paid
that
reasonable
value,
we
concede
that
they
are
entitled
to
file
claims
as
administration
creditors
and
receive
a
first
priority
in
payment
for
the
difference
between
the
reasonable
value
and
what
they
were
actually
paid.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
it
may
be
in
certain
instances,
but
it
also
may
not
be
indicative
if
in
fact
the
economic
situation
of
the
employer
has
changed,
has
deteriorated
to
the
point
where
he
can
no
longer
legitimately
pay
the
compensation
required
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
if
we
got
to
the
point
where
the
labor
agreement
is
rejected,
there
would
be
bargaining
in
the
sense
of
there
may
be
settlement
discussions.
i
would
think
there
would
be
a
claim
filed
by
the
employees
or
by
the
union
on
behalf
of
the
employees
for
the
value
of
those
services,
and
it
may
very
well
be,
as
in
all
contested
matters,
there
may
be
settlement
negotiations
between
the
debtor
and
the
union
to
determine
what
those
claims
are.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
under
the
third
circuit's
test,
the
debtor
in
possession,
although
a
new
entity,
is
still
an
employer,
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
required
to
bargain.
it
must
sit
down,
if
requested
by
the
union,
and
bargain
over
new
terms
and
conditions.
so
it
is
not
a
situation
where
the
union
is
forced
to
sit
back
forever
and
wait
until
the
debtor
decides
whether
it
wants
to
assume
or
reject
the
contract.
it
has
the
right
to
compel
bargaining.
and
that
bargaining
presumably
will
be
based
upon--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
much
like
a
successor,
justice
white.
you
indicated
that
there
was
some
difference
between
the
successor
doctrine
and
the
new
entity
doctrine,
and
certainly
there
is,
but
i
think
where
the
successorship
principles
make
sense
in
this
context
is
in
the
sense
that
a
debtor
in
possession
should
be
free
to
set
the
initial
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
which
is
not
to
say
that
he
does
not
then
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
over
new
terms
and
conditions.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
this
case,
as
i
read
it,
as
i
read
what
this
court
did
in
the
byrnes
case,
said
that
a
successor
is
not
necessarily
bound
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
its
predecessor's
contract,
and
is
free
to
set
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
initially,
which
again
is
not
to
say
that
it
doesn't
have
the
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
now,
your
honor,
there
are
ten
employees.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
at
the
time--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--there
were
18
at
the
time
that
the
chapter
11
petition
was
filed.
at
the
time
we
requested
that
the
bankruptcy
court
permit
rejection,
it
was
down
to
three.
there
are
now
ten
employees,
although
only
one
is...
this
is
what
i
am
advised
by
bildisco,
your
honor.
only
one
is
performing
a
job
which
would
have
been
performed
by
a
union
employee.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
the
company
has
been
reorganized.
it
is
operating
now,
although
its
business
function
has
changed
somewhat
dramatically.
it
was
a...
basically
a
wholesaler.
it
is
now
in
the
manufacturing
business.
and
that
was
accomplished
through
the
reorganization
process
of
chapter
11.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
the
burden
that
the
third
circuit
placed
on
a
debtor
is
quite
stringent
in
itself
when
one
analyzes
it.
it
is
really
a
twofold
showing
that
must
be
made.
number
one,
the
debtor
must
show
as
a
threshold
that
the
contract
is
burdensome,
and
then,
the
burden
is
still
on
the
debtor
to
show
that
the
balancing
of
the
equities
tips
in
favor
of
rejection,
that
the
harm
to
employees
is
outweighed
by
the
benefit
to
everyone
else
involved
in
the
reorganization
process.
i
think
that
that
in
itself
is
quite
a
stringent
standard,
especially
in
the
absence
of
any
suggestion
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
to
be
treated
differently
than
any
other
type
of
executory
contract.
under
all
other
types
of
executory
contracts,
the
so-called
business
judgment
test,
of
course,
is
applied,
and
that
is
simply
a
requirement
that
the
debtor
show
that
rejection
of
the
contract
would
benefit
the
estate.
i
suggest
that
any
time
a
debtor
in
possession
moves
to
reject
a
contract,
it
is
going
to
be
able
to
show
that,
at
least
in
the
majority
of
the
cases,
or
it
wouldn't
be
seeking
to
reject.
but
in
place
of
that
benefit
to
the
estate
concept,
which
doesn't
give
any
import
whatsoever
to
the
harm
to
the
non-debtor
party
to
the
contract,
the
third
circuit
has
said,
courts
must
focus
attention
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
on
the
harm
to
the
non-debtor
party,
in
this
case
the
union
employees,
and
consider
what
the
potential
impact
of
rejection
is
going
to
be
on
those
employees.
i
think
that
in
itself
is
quite
a
leap
forward
from
the
business
judgment
test,
and
it
is
quite
a
bit
of
a
more
stringent
showing
which
must
be
made.
if
i
might
in
the
time
remaining
address
myself
to
some
of
the
arguments
which
have
been
made
in
opposition
to
the
new
entity
theory,
what
we
have
is
a
criticism
that...
of
the
theory
on
the
grounds
that
since
management
and
operations
and
work
force
of
a
debtor
in
possession
are
often
unchanged,
the
debtor
in
possession
is
more
properly
deemed
as
the
alter
ego
of
a
pre-bankruptcy
company
rather
than
as
a
new
entity.
i
suggest
that
the
second
and
third
circuits,
both
of
which
have
adopted
the
new
entity
analysis,
really
had
it
right.
a
chapter
11
filing,
although
management
may
continue
much
as
before,
significantly
changes
the
way
in
which
a
debtor
must
conduct
its
business.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
no,
justice
rehnquist,
they
don't,
although
i
think
the
new
entity
theory
is
certainly
consistent
with
the
whole
concept
of
rejection
of
contracts.
there
is
nothing
which
distinguishes--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--i
think
that
because
the
courts
have
fashioned
the
business
judgment
test
to
apply
to
other
types
of
executory
contracts,
there
was
really
no
reason
to
elaborate
a
theory
as
to
why
that
standard
was
appropriate.
it
was
clearly
appropriate
because
the
congress
and
the
courts
deemed
that
debtors
in
possession
and
bankrupt
estates
should
not
be
bound
by
burdensome
pre-bankruptcy
contractual
obligations.
it
was
more
or
less
of
a
given.
so
that
the
courts
never
had
to
really
delve
behind
how
a
bankrupt
company
can
disaffirm
a
contract
when
under
controlling
state
law,
presumably,
that
is
a
breach.
but
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
where
the
courts
have
recognized
special
equities
on
the
side
of
union
employees,
i
think
that
it
did
take
a
little
more
elaboration
on
the
part
of
the
courts
to
explain
just
how
it
was
getting
to
the
result
which
it
was
achieving.
but
i
certainly
think
you
can
make
the
same
new
entity
argument
with
respect
to
any
executory
contract.
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
about
it.
it
was
just,
there
was
no
need
to
do
it,
i
think.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
the
union
remains
as
the
bargaining
unit
for
the
employees,
assuming
that
the
majority
of
the
debtors'
employees
are
still
members
of
that
union.
there
is
no
question
under
the
third
circuit
standard
that
the
union
remains
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
its
employees,
and
that
the
debtor
in
possession
is
obligated
to
bargain
with
the
union
in
good
faith.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
but
there
is...
the
way
i
would
view
it,
there
is
a
contract
in
existence
which
is...
the
enforcement
of
which
is
suspended.
in
other
words,
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
the--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--pardon
me?
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
well,
the
payment
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
is
suspended.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
of
course
it
is.
and
that
is
why
the
union
can
be
expected
to
demand
that
the
debtor
in
possession
bargain
and
to
reach
a
fair
wage
rate
if
in
fact
the
debtor
in
possession
has
indicated
he
is
going
to
reduce
the
wages.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
the
debtor
in
possession
and
the
union
can
bargain
for
a
new
contract,
yes.
that
goes
along
with
the
theory
that
the
debtor
in
possession
is
a
new
entity,
not
a
party
to
the
contract.
it
can
enter
into
a
new
contract.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
it
does
mean
that
at
least
for
the
period
of
time
the
company
is
in
chapter
11,
yes.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
yes,
it
was.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
there
really
is
no...
as
i
read
the
bankruptcy
code,
no
explicit
requirement
that
you
must
show
that.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
there
was,
you
are
correct--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--under
chapter
10.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
only,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
good
faith
requirements
which
are--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--well,
that
the
motives...
i
believe
the
way
the
courts
have
defined
good
faith
is
that
the
motives
in
filing
were
legitimate
business
purposes
in
seeking
to
reorganize
a
failing
business.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
that
justice
white
points
out
that
you
are
not
able
to
meet
your
debts
as
they
become
due,
and--
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
--yes.
i
think
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
determining
factor
along
with
a
balance
sheet
test,
what
are
the
value
of
the
assets
compared
with
the
liabilities.
mr.
jack
m.
zackin
i
think
it
must
apply
across
the
board,
and
i
think
if
you
meet
that
test,
if
you
can't
pay
your
debts
as
they
mature,
you
are
certainly
an
eligible
candidate
for
chapter
11.
in
closing,
i
would
just
like
to
state
that
what
i
believe
the
third
circuit
and
the
eleventh
circuit
in
brada
miller
have
done
is
to
truly
accommodate
the
goals
behind
the
bankruptcy
laws
and
the
goals
behind
the
labor
laws,
without
forcing
one
to
give
way
before
the
other.
the
test
that
was
formulated
by
the
third
circuit
does
not
unduly
promote
the
interests
of
organized
labor
to
the
point
where
it
holds
a
stranglehold
position
on
the
fate
of
a
chapter
11
debtor,
and
at
the
same
time,
it
does
not
unduly
sacrifice
the
rights
and
the
interests
of
organized
labor
to
achieve
a
successful
reorganization.
it
is
an
integration.
it
is
truly
a
balancing
test.
we
think
that
it
is
fair
to
all
parties
involved
in
the
reorganization
process.
we
think
it
is
workable.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
urge
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you
very
much.
