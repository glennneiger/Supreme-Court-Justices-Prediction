mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
consolidated
cases
involving
the
same
chapter
11
debtor
in
possession,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
prescribed
a
standard
to
be
used
by
a
bankruptcy
court
in
determining
whether
to
approve
an
application
to
reject
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
an
executory
contract,
and
how
that
approval
of
such
rejection
operates
retroactively
to
deprive
employees
of
rights
under
the
contract
during
the
entire
post-bankruptcy
petition
period,
and
thus
to
deprive
the
national
labor
relations
board
of
authority
to
remedy
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
the
debtor
in
possession's
unilateral
departure
from
the
contractually
prescribed
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
during
the
post-petition,
pre-rejection
period.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
both
respects.
because
i
have
only
15
minutes,
and
hope
to
reserve
a
little
time,
because
much
can
happen
during
the
ensuing
45,
all
i
can
try
to
do
is
summarize
what
we
think
are
the
governing
principles,
and
why
our
position
best
accommodates
the
two
federal
statutes
involved
and
maximizes
the
effectiveness
of
each.
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
question
have
agreed,
and
the
respondent
in
this
court
does
not
dispute
that
a
special
standard
must
govern
rejection
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
is
partly
because
of
the
special
nature
of
such
an
agreement,
as
prescribing
a
code
of
industrial
conduct,
and
because
the
employees,
unlike
others,
are
totally
dependent
for
their
livelihood
on
their
relation
with
the
employer.
but
the
basic
reason
is
because
of
a
statutory
conflict
between
the
application
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
authority
to
set
aside
an
executory
contract
and
the
labor
relations
act's
prohibition
of
mid-term
modification
or
termination
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
unless
both
parties
to
the
agreement
agree.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
labor
act
does
say
that
there
cannot
be
midterm
rejection
or
modification,
termination
or
modification
of
a
labor
contract,
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
unless
both
parties
agree
pursuant
to
prescribed
procedures,
and
yet
there
is
reason
to
think
that
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
set
aside
executory
contracts
does
extend
to
collective
bargaining
agreements.
on
the
face
of
the
statutes,
they
do
look
in
opposite
directions,
and
congress
has
not
explicitly
said
how
this
conflict
should
be
resolved,
but
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
we
believe
it
implicitly
ratified
the
resolution
that
had
been
developed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
was
the
only
appellate
decision
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
congress
did
indicate
some
awareness
of
those
decisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
legislative
history
of
prior
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
act,
but
not
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
code
itself,
but
because
the
same
committees
dealt
with--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
just
the
general
principle
that
congress
is
presumed
to
be
aware
of
how
the
law
has
developed,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
relied
basically
on
the
lorillard
case,
which
refers
to
that
principle,
but
our
main
argument
is
that
in
any
event,
the
second
circuit's
resolution
is
the
proper
one,
regardless
of
whether
it
can
be
said
that
congress
implicitly
ratified
it,
and
under
that
standard--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
brada
miller
is
what
we
have
been
calling
it,
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
and
judge
mansfield's
opinion
in
rea
express
for
the
second
circuit.
we
do
think
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
is
very
close
to
that.
although
it
explicitly
says
it
disagrees
with
it,
it
does
say
in
another
passage
that
it
thinks
that
a
factor
that
the
second
circuit
says
is
essential
is
going
to
be
an
important
inquiry
in
many,
many
instances.
the
case
will
turn
on
that.
and
that
is
the
inquiry
whether
rejection
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
necessary
to
avoid
collapse
of
the
business
as
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
the
viability
of
the
business.
this,
we
believe,
should
be
the
central
inquiry,
because
for
one
thing
it
is
a
question
that
is
properly
within
the
competency
of
a
bankruptcy
court
to
determine,
unlike
the
kind
of
second
guessing
of
the
collective
bargaining
process
that
otherwise
is
suggested
in
opinions
about
balancing
the
equities
to
determine
whether
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
other
than
those
bargained
for
would
be
fairer
under
the
circumstances
to
both
the
employees
and
the
employer,
and
to
take
into
account
what
is
the
likelihood
that
a
strike
might
be
provoked
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
set
aside,
the
kinds
of
inquiries
that
congress,
as
this
court
has
emphasized,
has
left
to
the
bargaining
process
and
the
parties
themselves,
and
has
prohibited
even
experts
in
labor
management
relations,
such
as
the
labor
board,
from
second
guessing
the
bargaining
process
with
respect
to,
and
the
kind
of
inquiries
that
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
congress
asking
a
bankruptcy
court
to
resolve.
and
while
the
standard
focusing
on
preservation
of
the
business,
its
viability,
thus
would
preserve
the
basic
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
would
also
maximize
preservation
of
rights
under
the
labor
act
by
reducing
only
to
a
risk
of
error
in
the
resolution
of
that
question
the
preservation
of
rights
that
otherwise
would
survive
under
the
labor
contract,
and
by
making
it
less
apt
that
the
bankruptcy
court's
decision
will
provoke
a
work
stoppage
because
of
unacceptability
to
the
employees
who
have
been
operating
under
the
contract
if
they
perceive
that
the
question
that
has
been
answered
is
whether
their
contract
rights
can
survive
in
any
event,
and
that
has
been
the
inquiry.
it
also
puts
in
the
proper
context
for
bankruptcy
court
resolution
such
emotional
matters
as
evidence
on
anti-union
animus
that
may
have
motivated
the
employer
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
the
bankruptcy
court
by
and
large
should
regard
that
as
going
to
the
credibility
of
the
employers
being
able
to
show
that
it
is
necessary
in
the
context
of
a
comprehensive
look
at
his
operations
and
his
obligations,
that
it
is
necessary
to
set
aside
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
order
for
the
business
to
survive.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
see
nothing
improper
about
that.
we
see
nothing
improper
about
that,
if
the
company
can
make
the
requisite
showing
in
the
context
of
all
of
its
obligations
and
operations
that
it
needs
to
have
that
contract
set
aside
in
order
for
the
business
to
remain
a
viable
one,
or
to
be
converted
into
a
viable
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
really.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
predictive
matter.
there
is
no
way
that
the
future
can
be
proved
with
certainty.
on
the
relation
back
issue,
if
i
can
advert
to
that
basically,
we
see
no
conflict
between
the
bankruptcy
law
and
the
labor
law.
the
bankruptcy
law
sharply
differentiates
between
pre-petition
and
post-petition
obligations
of
the
trustee
or
debtor
in
possession
in
order
to
encourage
persons
to
continue
to
provide
goods
and
services.
a
vendor,
for
example,
obligated
to
provide
lumber
or
potatoes
or
what
have
you,
is
prohibited
by
the
bankruptcy
law
from
terminating
the
contract
merely
because
the
other
party
goes
into
bankruptcy,
and
the
obvious
meaning
of
that
is
that
as
he
continues
to
supply
those
goods
until
the
contract
is
set
aside
he
is
operating
under
the
terms
of
the
contract.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
of
employees
where
terminable
at
will
but
who
are
kept
on
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
it
would
never
occur
to
anyone
that
the
debtor
in
possession
could
four
months
later
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
ask
the
bankruptcy
court
retroactively
to
change
the
salaries
or
the
health
benefits
that
those
employees
were
told
they
were
entitled
to
while
they
were
performing
those
services,
and
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
reason
to
ask
the
court
to
set
aside
further
obligations
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
provide
a
reason
to
treat
employees
operating
under
that
agreement
any
differently.
if
anything,
it
brings
in
considerations
of
the
labor
act
as
well.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
we
point
out
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
the
national
labor
relations
act
refers
specifically
to
trustees
in
bankruptcy
as
persons
covered
by
the
act.
the
board
here
in
its
findings
on
page
34-a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
found
that
the
respondent
was
an
alter
ego
of
bildisco,
using
the
term
in
much
the
way
this
court
used
it
in
the
howard
johnson
case,
in
a
footnote
that
began,
"it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
in
that
case
it
was
not
an
alter
ego.
"
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
specified
that
it
would
apply
to
successors
to
bildisco.
here
you
have
the
same
ownership
under
a
different
arrangement
operating
the
same
enterprise,
and
the
contract
therefore
continued
to
apply
under
standard
principles
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
if
a
vendor
of
lumber
or
potatoes
continues
to
supply
the
bankrupt
debtor
in
possession
until
that
contract
is
rejected,
his
rights
are
prescribed
by
the
contract,
as
we
understand
the
law.
the
contract
not
only
says
what
he
should
be
paid.
it
will
specify
terms
of
delivery,
when
the
payment
should
be
made,
et
cetera.
there
are
rights
prescribed
by
the
contract.
the
bankruptcy
court
doesn't
have
some
general
measure
of
the
market
value
of
what
he
is
entitled
to
for
the
services
that
he
continued
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
the
source
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--confusion,
because
all
that
refers
to
in
our
view
is
a
damage
claim
for
rejection
of
further
rights
under
that
contract.
the
other
party
to
the
contract
can
then
claim
that
he
was
damaged,
and
can
show
what
the
monetary
damages
were,
and
that
claim
relates
back,
and
he
stands
on
the
same
basis
as
pre-petition
creditors
for
those
further
claims,
but
while
he
was
performing,
up
until
the
time
of
rejection,
his
rights
are
prescribed
by
the
contract,
and
that
is
part
of
the
administrative
expense
of
trying
to
make
this
business
thrive
by
assuring
people
that
they
can
continue
to
deal
with
this
business
without
worrying
that
their
rights
are
going
to
be
compromised
by
the
pre-existing
indebtedness.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
for
employees.
the
contract
here
under
which
they
were
working
didn't
just
prescribe
wages.
it
has
many
provisions
about
health
contributions,
welfare
contributions,
union
dues,
sick
leave
rights,
paid
holidays,
et
cetera.
all
of
those
rights
were
prescribed
by
the
contract
just
as
if
the
employer
had
said
to
non-contract
employees,
if
you
stay
on
with
me,
it
will
be
at
$800
a
month,
and
i
will
pay
health
insurance
benefits.
