mr.
james
r.
zazzali
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
adopt
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
with
respect
to
the
standard
issue,
and
instead
i
would
move
on
to
the
subject
of
8(d),
which
is
the
requirement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
compels
a
party
seeking
to
modify
or
terminate
a
contract
to
give
notice
to
and
to
negotiate
with
the
other
party.
we
think
that
8(d)
should
be
a
condition
precedent
to
the
rejection
of
a
union
contract,
because
we
think
8(d)
is
in
the
public
interest
as
a
public
statute
designed
to
protect
the
common
weal.
we
are
only
asking
for
purposes
of
this
discussion
that
not
all
of
the
trappings
and
the
trimmings
of
8(d)
be
superimposed
upon
the
employer
or
the
union.
rather,
we
simply
ask
a
party
to
give
notice
to
and
to
negotiate
with
the
other
party
to
that
contract
before
the
contract
is
automatically
rejected
ipso
facto.
if
the
employer
refuses
to
come
to
an
agreement,
and
mind
you
that
we
have
never
suggested
that
concessions
must
be
made
by
the
employer,
but
if
the
renegotiations
do
not
work
out,
or
if
the
union
simply
refuses
to
negotiate,
the
employer
is
then
free
to
seek
rejection
of
the
contract
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question,
we
do
indeed
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
generally
a
labor
contract
is
an
executory
contract
which
may
be,
in
appropriate
circumstances,
subject
to
the
correct
standard,
be
rejected.
but
again,
as
a
legitimate
and
viable
condition
precedent
to
that
rejection,
we
think
there
should
be
negotiations.
that
is
a
moderate
and
a
modest
proposal.
it
is
a
reasonable
and
a
reasoned
position.
it
is
designed,
above
all,
to
again
protect
the
public
interest
and
to
pay
due
respect
to
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
to
the
interests
and
to
the
rights
of
employers
who
are
financially
embarrassed.
it
allows,
to
use
the
phrase
of
the
fifties,
a
peaceful
coexistence
between
management
and
labor,
between
employees
and
employer.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
think
in
terms
of
the
policy
considerations
here,
because
there
are
multiple
requirements,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
white.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--no,
it
is
in
negotiations.
obviously,
we
would
like
to
see
notice
to
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service,
which
is
mandated,
notice
to
the
state
agencies,
but
i
think
in
an
appropriate
exercise
of
discretion
those
requirements
can
be
dispensed.
it
seems
the
key...
the
key
responsibility,
to
use
the
vernacular,
is
to
get
the
parties
together
in
the
public
interest
to
bang
out
an
agreement
if
at
all
possible,
and
we
would
therefore
urge
that--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--your
honor,
i
can
appreciate
the
concern
about
time.
it
is
a
suggestion
that
has
been
made
by
some
of
the
parties
to
the
briefs
and
some
of
the
amici
in
the
case.
we
would
note,
number
one,
that
this
is
not
the
railway
labor
act,
which
has
a
complex
and
convoluted
series
of
requirements
for
negotiations.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
yes,
but
impasse--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--it
can
be--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct,
but
given
the
exigencies
of
the
particular
situation,
that
is,
bankruptcy,
and
given
the
responsibility
of
both
parties
and,
we
hope,
the
maturity
of
both
parties,
impasse
can
be
in
two
weeks,
it
can
be
achieved
in
two
days,
it
can
be
achieved
in
two
hours.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
that's
correct,
but
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
bankruptcy
court
in
a
proper
exercise
of
its
discretion
to
perhaps
order
an
expedited
negotiation
schedule.
there
are--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--it
could,
your
honor,
but
that
is
something
considerably
different
than
negotiations.
participation--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--because
i
don't--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--because
as
we
understand
the
bankruptcy
court's
determination,
it
is
an
all
or
none
decision
by
the
bankruptcy
court
to
terminate
or
not
to
terminate,
to
reject
all
parts
of
that
collective
agreement
or
none
at
all,
to
reject
the
non-monetary
as
well
as
the
monetary
benefits.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
can
conceive
of
that
happening,
but
of
course,
sui
sponte,
the
court
in
an
exercise
of
its
discretion...
it
might
well
be
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--absolutely
not,
but
going
back
to
justice
white's
inquiry,
it's
too
late
by
the
time
we
get
to
bankruptcy
court
to
have
a
hearing
on
rejection
to
negotiate
out
the
problems.
it
seems
to
me
to
make
more
sense
to
have
the
parties
sit
down,
discuss,
negotiate,
call
it
what
you
will,
work
out
these
difficulties.
the
union--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--i
would--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--i
would
not
encourage
the
bankruptcy
court
to
play
an
active
role
in
the
negotiations.
it
can
maintain
a
monitoring
position
perhaps
or
a
supervisory
role,
but
to
be
actively
involved
in
the
negotiations
is
probably
unwise.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i,
although--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--i
think
there
should
be
negotiations.
i
think
the
ball
game
is
effectively
over
at
that
point.
it
is
beyond
the
twelfth
hour.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
you
are
correct,
your
honor,
but
on
a
practical
level,
to
obtain
anything
of
consequence
in
the
post-rejection
period
simply,
according
to
the
experiential
data,
are
not
going
to
happen.
experience
has
indicated
that
we
are
not
going
to
resolve
it
after
rejection.
the
sensible
approach
is
to
let
the
parties,
if
at
all
possible,
get
together,
work
out
their
difficulties,
and
then
if
the
parties
cannot
work
out
their
difficulties,
let
it
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court,
let
the
bankruptcy
court
hold
the
hearing
on
rejecting
the
contract.
at
least
the
union
would
have
been...
and
the
employer
would
have
been
placed
on
their
respective
spots
by
having
to,
to
use
the
vernacular
again,
to
put
up
or
shut
up.
certainly
a
union
in
that
situation...
and
experience
has
indicated
that
the
vast
majority
of
unions
do
face
up
to
their
responsibilities,
and
according
to
the
recent
headlines
do
meet
the
necessity,
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
by
renegotiating
contracts.
that
is
why
this
is
a
public
statute,
and
the
distressing
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
some
of
the
amici
and
others
have
suggested
that
it
is
a
fight
between...
exclusively
between
employees
and
employer,
between
labor
and
management,
between
big
labor
and
big
management,
between
the
orioles
and
the
phillies,
and
it
is
none
of
those
things.
what
it
is,
it's
a
public
statute
designed
to
protect
the
public
interest.
twelve
years
ago,
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass,
this
court
said
precisely
that
when
it
advised
us
that
the
purpose
of
8(d)
is
to
facilitate
agreement
rather
than
economic
warfare,
and
thereby
avoid
interruptions
in
the
production
of
goods
and
in
the
flow
of
commerce,
and
it
is
by
the
simple
expedient
of
sitting
down
and
talking
out
the
problems,
which
is
what
this
labor
relations
business
is
all
about
in
the
last
analysis,
that
we
are
urging
upon
this
court.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
think
that
literally
it
all
should
apply,
but
i
think
in
a...
since
we
are
seeking
an
accommodation
of
the
two
statutes,
and
since
i
think
that
reconciliation
is
in
the
public
interest,
i
think
both
statutes
have
to
bend
to
meet
that
public
interest,
and
therefore
literally
i
don't
think
we
have
to
accept
all
the
requirements
of
8(d),
but
simply
the
guts
to
get
those
parties
together.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
would--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--i
think
the
public
interest
would
tolerate
something
less
than
total
compliance.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
would
think...
yes,
your
honor,
i
would--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--respectfully,
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
arguing
that.
i
think
that
there
should
still
be
a
per
se
requirement
in
accordance
with
section
8(d)
to
get
the
parties
together
to
negotiate
out
their
differences.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
it
might
require,
in
justice
frankfurter's
phrase,
rather
some
elucidating
litigation
in
order
to
attempt
to
reconcile
these
differences.
we
are
here
to
accommodate
the
statutes.
i
think
any
accommodation
does
not
necessarily
mandate
a
rewriting
of
the
statute
perhaps
reposing
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
bankruptcy
court
the
appropriate
exercise
of
discretion.
that
is
how
the
common
weal
can
be
best
served
in
our
judgment.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
yes,
which
i
think
is--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--if
you
agree,
your
honor.
i
think
the
commentators
in
other
circuits
have
soundly
repudiated
the
new
entity
theory
on
the
grounds--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
a...
it
is
simply
a
legal
fiction.
as
judge
tuttle
said
in
the
brada
miller
decision--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
roundly
disagrees
with
that,
saying
that
this
is
at
best
a
new
juridical
entity
rather
than
a
new
entity.
i
think
most
of
the
commentators
and
the
courts
below,
admittedly
not
this
court,
have
urged
that--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--i
think,
for
example,
the
article
by
countryman
quoted
in
a
number
of
the
briefs,
and
i
think
the
michigan
law
review
article.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
i
think
the
countryman
article
was
written
by
a
law
professor.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
that
i
am
honestly
not
sure
of,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
well,
i
do
think
that
i
commend
the
conclusion
to
you
that
the
new
entity
theory
does
not
stand
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
makes
no
sense,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
to
say
that
a
new
entity
is
bound
by
an
old
contract.
either
a
new
entity
is
or
is
not
bound,
and
the
entire
problem
of
new
entity,
as
the
successorship
theory,
gives
pause.
to
say
similarly
that
an
employer
who
is
a
new
entity
must
nevertheless
go
and
seek
rejection
of
a
contract
makes
no
sense
at
all.
and
i
think...
not
a
commentator,
but
i
think
at
least
one
and
perhaps
two
of
the
circuits
have
said
the
same
thing,
that
it
is...
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
the
employer
who
is
a
new
entity
must
nonetheless
go
in
and
apply
to
reject
the
contract...
the
contract.
if
he
is
a
new
entity,
clearly,
a
fortiori,
he
is
not
bound
by
the
old
contract.
the
difficulty
with
so
much
of
this
is
that
rather
than
reconciling
the
two
statutes
in
favor
of
coexistence,
we
have
the
circuit
below
in
the
matter
sub
judicii,
really
sanctifying
the
bankruptcy
code
over
the
national
labor
policy,
and
that
is
why
i
suggested,
justice
stevens,
that
we
really
aim
towards
some
kind
of
a
sensible
accommodation
of
the
conflicting
statutes.
it
is
interesting
that
the
employers
are
saying
today,
reject
the
contract
and
therefore
the
union
has
the
right
to
strike.
that
sets
labor
relations
on
its
head
in
this
nation,
and
it
seems
to
me
is
a
deja
vu
return
to
the
policies
of
50
years
ago,
when
precisely...
it
was
precisely
the
act
and
this
court
which
sought
to
encourage
meaningful,
peaceful
collective
bargaining
as
an
alternative
to
the
right
to
strike.
and
instead,
we
now
have
employers
saying,
gee,
if
you
have
the
contract
rejected,
the
unions
then
have
the
right
to
strike.
that
is
not
healthy.
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
not
at
all,
clearly,
and
that's
the
problem.
clearly,
the
union
shall
have
the
right
to--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct.
the
union
shall
have
the
right
to
strike,
and
then
we
return
to
the
test
of
strength
that--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
one
of
the
questions
before
this
court.
the
problem,
of
course,
is--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct,
but--
mr.
james
r.
zazzali
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
contract
has
not
only
been
rejected,
but
every
part
of
that
contract
is
being
rejected,
including
seniority
provisions,
and
therefore
what
will
happen
is
what
is
happening,
according
to
the
documented
cases,
and
employees
are
being
laid
off
and
the
union
is
losing
its
majority.
in
closing,
i
thank
your
honors,
and
would
urge
that
the
reconciliation
we
have
urged
be
considered
rather
than
these
employees
be
treated,
frankly,
as
inventory
under
the
bankruptcy
code.
thank
you.
