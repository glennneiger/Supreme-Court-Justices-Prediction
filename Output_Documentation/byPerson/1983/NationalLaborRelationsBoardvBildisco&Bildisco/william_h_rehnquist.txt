justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
bankruptcy
act
of
business
debtor
may
choose
between
straight
bankruptcy
and
are
continued
to
operate
as
business
as
a
debtor-in-possession.
and
one
of
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
act
in
the
debtor-in-possession
is
the
right
to
apply
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
for
the
authority
to
reject
the
contract
entered
into
by
the
bankrupt
as
burdensome
to
the
estate.
these
consolidated
cases
present
two
questions
involving
the
application
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
collective-bargaining
agreements
negotiated
by
the
debtor-in-possession.
first,
what
standards
apply
to
rejection
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
and
second,
does
the
debtor-in-possession
violate
the
labor
law
if
it
unilaterally
modifies
the
labor
contract
after
it
files
a
bankruptcy
position
and
before
it
obtains
formal
court
approval
to
reject
the
contract.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
from
which
this
case
comes
ruled
in
favor
of
bildisco,
which
was
the
debtor-in-possession
in
this
case
on
both
of
these
issues,
rejecting
the
standard
of
rejection
proposed
by
the
union
and
refusing
to
enforce
an
order
of
the
labor
board.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
passing
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1978,
congress
provided
the
debtors
undergoing
a
reorganization
would
have
the
power
to
apply
to
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
ask
the
bankruptcy
judge
to
allow
them
to
reject
a
contract.
congress
provided
a
special
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
code
to
govern
the
rejection
of
some
labor
contracts,
those
under
the
railway
act,
but
provided
no
special
provision
for
separate
treatment
for
those
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
therefore
hold
that
the
contracts
are
governed
by
the
general
provision
allowing
rejection.
but
we've
also
held
that
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
is
a
special
type
of
agreement
and
we
hold
that
it
somewhat
stricter
standard
than
the
traditional
business
judgment
standard
should
govern
the
bankruptcy
cour's
decision
to
permit
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
to
be
rejected.
the
debtor-in-possession
must
show
that
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
burdens
the
estate
and
that
the
equities
balance
in
favor
of
rejecting
the
contract.
we
also
hold
today
that
a
debtor-in-possession
does
not
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
unilaterally
modifies
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
to
give
the
debtor
time
and
flexibility
to
reorganize
its
business.
the
bankruptcy
code
clearly
delineates
how
claims
arising
from
a
post-petition
breach
of
contract
claim
should
be
processed.
requiring
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
through
the
mechanism
of
board
enforcement,
we
think
would
undermine
the
bankruptcy
code's
in
a
regulation
of
such
claims.
even
more
important,
it
undermines
the
goal
of
the
bankruptcy
act
to
facilitate
a
successful
reorganization.
we
think
that
our
determination
respects
the
basic
policy
of
the
labor
laws
to
protect
the
process
of
collective-bargaining
and
still
recognizes
the
overwriting
goals
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
all
nine
members
of
the
court
joined
in
the
court's
opinion
establishing
the
standard
for
rejecting
a
collective-bargaining
agreement.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
dissenting
from
the
holding
about
the
unfair
labor
practices
in
which
justices
white,
marshall,
blackmun
joined.
