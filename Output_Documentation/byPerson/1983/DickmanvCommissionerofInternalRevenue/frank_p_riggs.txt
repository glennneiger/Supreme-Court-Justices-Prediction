mr.
frank
p.
riggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
gift
tax
case,
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
reversed
a
decision
for
the
taxpayers
by
the
united
states
tax
court.
it
involves
loans
from
a
father
to
his
son,
who
worked
with
him
in
the
family
businesses,
and
from
that
father
to
a
family-owned
corporation.
all
loans
were
non-interest-bearing,
and
the
stated
terms
of
all
were
repayable
on
demand,
with
one
exception.
a
note,
while
a
ten-year
note
on
its
face,
was
determined
by
the
tax
court
as
a
fact
to
be
repayable
on
demand.
therefore,
there
is
only
one
issue:
are
demand
loans
subject
to
gift
tax
on
imputed
interest?
there
is
no
subterfuge
involved.
the
validity
of
the
loans
are
not
challenged
by
the
respondent.
all
loans
are
bona
fide
and
they
are
what
they
purport
to
be.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
the
major
case
is
berkman
in
the
united
states
tax
court.
there
they
were
able
to
fit
into
what
is
now
2512(b).
there
was
an
exchange.
as
long
as
the
term
notes,
as
in
the
berkman
and
blackburn
cases,
were
given
in
exchange,
we
fit
into
the
exception
to
the
normal
definition
of
gift
that's
listed
by
section
2512(b).
i'll
come
back
to
that
if
i
may,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
i
made
that
assumption.
the
son
in
this
case,
lyle
dickman,
died
in
december
of
1976.
the
father
in
this
case,
paul
dickman...
i'm
sorry,
the
son
died
in
may.
the
father
died
in
december
of
1976,
both
dying
in
the
same
year.
in
lyle's
estate,
the
son's
estate,
100
percent
of
the
unpaid
balances
on
the
indebtedness
at
issue
here
were
deducted
and
that
deduction
was
accepted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
in
paul's
estate,
the
father's
estate,
all
of
the
notes
at
issue
here
were
reported
as
assets
at
100
percent
of
the
unpaid
balance,
and
that
estate
tax
return
was
accepted
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
our
point
or
our
position
and
what
we
would
like
to
emphasize
here
at
oral
argument
can
be
stated
briefly
in
three
points:
one,
the
gift
tax
code
cannot
be
reasonably
interpreted
to
include
the
respondent's
right
to
use
theory.
whis
theory
that
there
is
a
property
right
to
use
we
submit
amounts
to
no
more
than
the
attempt
to
tax
potential
income
as
a
gift.
second,
the
decision
below,
if
it
is
upheld,
will
destroy
the
reasonable
expectations
of
many
taxpayers
and
will
add
to
an
already
overburdened
judiciary.
three,
if
there
is
a
gap
in
the
present
law
which
should
be
corrected,
congress
should
act
and
not
the
executive
or
the
judicial
branches.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
how
they
were
advising
their
clients.
before
crown,
a
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
texas,
if
i
remember
correctly,
decided
this
same
issue
and
decided
it
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
and
the
government
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
that,
before
the
crown
case,
was
the
only
judicial
action
in
the
area
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no,
ma'am.
i
really
believe
that
what's
at
stake
here
has
been
common
among
families
as
long
as
there
have
been
families.
and
a
great
many
of
these
loans
are
made
with
absolutely
no
tax
results
in
mind
at
all.
that's
the
reason
i
was
hesitant
to
respond
to
you
what
tax
lawyers
are
doing.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
ma'am.
but
an
awful
lot
of
taxpayers
annually
make
the
amount
of
the
annual
exclusion
as
a
gift.
then
the
very
next
dollar
after
that
either
results
in
a
tax
or
it
reduces
a
one-time
lifetime
credit.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no,
sir,
not
unless
you
add
something
into
the
gift
tax
code
that
has
never
been
there
before.
our
basic
position
in
regard
to
the
code,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
1932
congress
knew
what
they
were
doing.
they
didn't
pass
a
tax
which
taxed
transfers
of
property
by
gift
in
a
vacuum.
there
already
existed
a
common
law
of
gifts.
it
was
very
clear
under
the
common
law
of
gifts
that
any
consideration
negated
a
gift.
in
fact,
as
we
cite
you
to
the
zeller
case
in
our
reply
brief,
a
loan
was
the
antithesis
of
a
gift.
and
our
position
is
that
the
united
states
congress
knew
that.
they
deliberately
took
the
word
2501
and
left
it
in
there.
we
have,
we
think,
a
great
many
indications
that
that
was
deliberate
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
congress,
that
includes
many
fine
lawyers.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no
question
about
it.
there's
a
transfer
of
property
by
gift,
the
quitclaim
deed,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
the
great
difference,
your
honor,
is
the
common
law
on
which
the
statute
is
superimposed.
a
use...
and
incidentally,
the
use
doesn't
have
to
be
actual
under
the
government's
theory.
the
mere
opportunity
is
all
that's
required.
but
a
use
has
never
been
a
gift.
and
our
whole
point
is
that
the
congress
knew
how
to
write
this
statute.
when
they
used
the
word
2512(b),
if
you
please.
there
they
say
that
the
excess
of
property
conveyed
over
a
consideration
received,
not
is
a
gift...
the
united
states
congress
knew
that
a
loan
was
not
a
gift...
but
they
said
it
would
be
deemed
a
gift.
that's
how
the
berkman
case
came
about,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
loan
in
the
berkman
case,
the
term
loan,
was
not
a
gift,
was
not
a
gift
as
the
united
states
congress
understood.
but
it
fell
under
2512(b)
and
was
deemed
a
gift.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
that's
close,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
used
the
word
"gift",
that
they
went
on
in
another
area
that
clearly
was
not
a
gift
and
said
this
also
will
be
deemed
a
gift,
that
they
clearly
knew
what
they
were
doing.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--yes,
sirree.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
certainly.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
justice
brennan,
i
share
your
appreciation
for
that
authority.
i
have
great
respect
for
him.
that
would
require,
we
submit,
a
little
more
ambiguity
to
fall
into
dean
griswold's
statement.
we
don't
believe
the
ambiguity
is
here.
we
don't
question,
justice
brennan,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
tax
these
uses
if
it
sees
fit.
but
we
do
submit
to
you,
it
clearly
didn't
see
fit.
the
experience
in
great
britain
is
a
beautiful
example
of
what
happens
when
a
legislature
wants
to
tax
that
far.
i
think
it's
very
significant
that
they
avoided
the
use
of
the
word
"gift".
they
passed
a
capital
transfer
tax.
they
knew
better.
we
submit,
though,
there's
other
evidence--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
well,
i
don't
understand
an
iou,
justice
marshall,
to
be
any
more
than,
without
any
other
facts,
than
simply
an
open
account
loan,
which
amounts
to
a
non-interest
bearing
demand
loan.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no,
sir,
i
don't
know
of
any
of
the
present
litigation
that
simply
referred
to
the
obligation
as
an
iou.
of
course,
i
believe
that
a
note
is
nothing
but
an
iou.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
and
our
whole
point
is
that
if
you're
going
to
find
something
is
not
a
gift...
and
a
loan
is
not;
it's
the
antithesis
of
a
gift...
then
you're
going
to
have
to
fit
under
this
exchange
of
property
transferred
over
the
consideration
received.
but
at
the
moment
of
that
exchange
even
the
respondent
concedes
no
gift
took
place.
there's
an
equal
exchange.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
you
have
now
the
term.
you
have,
as
i
understand,
no
consideration,
though.
you
have
a
transfer
of
this
term
lease,
this
property,
if
you
will.
but
without
the
consideration,
you're
going
to
have
to
find
a
gift.
you're
going
to
have
to
find
a
transfer
of
property
by
gift.
i
suspect...
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it
may
be
when
you
get
to
99
years
you're
so
close
to
fee
simple
that
you
have
something
that
can
fit
into
the
normal
definition
of
gift.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
i
don't
know
where
the
line
is,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
the
common
law
on
which
the
very
knowledgeable
1932
congress
superimposed
the
gift
tax,
justice
rehnquist.
under
the
common
law...
we
cite
the
zeller
case
to
you
in
our
reply
brief...
a
loan
is
the
antithesis
of
a
gift.
a
loan
simply
is
not
a
gift.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
there's
no
borrowing
involved.
i
would
think
that...
quite
frankly,
i
haven't
thought
of
that
area.
i
don't
know
of
any
reason
that
you
can't
make
a
transfer
of
a
property
interest
that
would
qualify
as
a
gift.
but--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--the
area
in
which
we're
in,
justice
rehnquist,
is
a
transfer
for
consideration.
see,
that's
the
problem
i'm
having
with
the
justice's
question.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
i'm
having
a
tough
time,
justice
white,
justice
rehnquist,
about
bringing
this
into
our
problem,
and
that
is
a
loan.
i
wouldn't
be
surprised...
i
haven't
done
the
research,
but
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
a
gift
of
a
term
certain--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--exactly,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
in
the
charitable
contributions
area,
yes.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
big
difference
is,
we're
talking
about
another
statute
entirely.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
allows
a
deduction
for
a
contribution
to
or
for
the
use
of.
the
statute
with
which
we're
dealing
here
defines
where
there's
a
gift
tax.
one
place,
under
2501,
is
when
there's
a
gift.
another
place,
under
2512(b),
is
where
there's
an
exchange
that
shall
be
deemed
a
gift.
and
i
apologize
to
judge
rehnquist
and
justice
white.
i
suspect
that
if
the
common
law
covered
leases
that
your
point
is
well
taken,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
have
to
get
back
here
into
this
area
of
a
loan.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
we
submit
that
there's
even
more
indications,
your
honor,
that
congress,
the
1932
congress,
not
only
knew
what
they
were
doing,
but
this
is
a
brand
new
addition
into
the
gift
tax.
the
time
elapsing
between
1932
and
the
internal
revenue
service
attack...
the
service
has
never
denied
the
the
statement
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
crown
case
that
taxation
of
a
use
is
brand
new.
but
they're
asking
you
for
more
than
taxation
of
a
use.
they're
asking
you
for
taxation
of
an
opportunity
to
use.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
i
can
think
of
three
uses
to
which
borrowed
funds
may
be
put:
one,
investment,
earn
interest
or
dividends;
another,
consume
it,
pay
for
an
operation
or
something
that
you
need.
there's
a
third
that
i've
had
a
devil
of
a
time
setting
across,
because
i
guess
it's
unique
to
business.
but
really,
funds
borrowed
and
used
in
a
business
become
at
least
to
a
minimum
extent
as
much
a
fixed
asset
of
the
business
as
a
punch
press,
a
tractor,
or
anything
else.
you
can't
run
a
business
without
a
minimum
amount
of
money
that
stays
in
the
cycle
between
receivables,
inventory,
purchases,
accounts
payable.
so
that's
at
least
three
areas
in
which
borrowed
funds
may
be
used.
certainly,
the
imputed
interest,
the
potential
income
that
the
service
wants
to
tax
now,
is
not
always
there.
that's
the
reason
that
i
say
that
the
opportunity
to
use
is
much
more
expansive.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
sir,
and
if
the
code
had
taxed
that
use.
however,
that's
one
of
the
what
we
call
or
what
i
call
invisible
boomerangs,
that
i
stole
from
justice
jackson.
the
service
position
is
that
you
have
the
normal
valuation
problems
here,
that
the
rate
of
interest
will
be
determined
based
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
not
on
what
happens
in
some
general
market
between
major
companies
and
banks.
if
that's
true,
every
issue
is
a
new
case
and
you
don't
even
have
the
protection
of
collateral
estoppel.
the
credit
ratings
are
not
fungible
any
more
than
individuals
are.
so
we
have
that
pandora's
box
we're
looking
at.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
a
couple
more
points
that
give
evidence
that
the
statute
simply
does
not
include
demand
loans.
the
1932
committee
reports
were
pretty
well
identical
out
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
out
of
the
senate
finance
committee.
both
of
them
used
some
very
broad
words
that
the
respondent
likes
to
quote.
but
those
broad
words
are
followed
by
some
examples
of
what
they
meant.
one
example
is
a
joint
bank
account,
where
a
creates
a
joint
bank
account
whereby
a
or
b
may
unilaterally
withdraw.
now,
if
a
property
right
to
use
were
in
the
thinking
of
these
committees,
they
would
have
never
held
that
there
is
no
gift
to
b
until
b
does
withdraw
and
withdraw
for
his
own
use,
because
once
that
chose
in
action
is
created
why
isn't
there
a
property
right
to
use
created
in
b?
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
sir?
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
in
the
example,
i
would
assume
a
demand
checking
account.
but
i
don't
know
that
it
would
matter.
there's
one
more
evidence,
and
i
guess
the
strongest
evidence,
that
the
1932
code
did
not
include
demand
loans,
and
that's
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
case
below
that
we're
asking
you
to
reverse.
that
opinion
we
submit
flat
tells
you
that
this
code
does
not
tax
demand
loans.
to
quote
them
exactly,
they
say
taxpayers
have
"given
away
no
property,
no
interest,
and
no
rights,
but
surely
they
have
made
a
gift.
"
our
point,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you've
given
away
no
property,
no
interest,
no
rights,
under
the
code
you
have
not
made
a
gift
and
you
have
not
even
made,
once
the
exchange
is
even,
you
have
not
even
made
a
deemed
gift.
i'm
going
to
save
a
little
bit
for
rebuttal
if
there's
no
further
questions.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
concerned
primarily
with
the
big
dollars
connotation
that
i
have
been
listening
to
some
here.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
with
you
if
i
didn't
admit
that
the
whole
area
of
estate
and
gift
taxes
affects
only
the
relatively
affluent.
but
it
seems
to
me
like
that
the
question
is,
how
shall
we
affect
this
group
of
people,
by
the
use
of
statutes
or
by
new
interpretations?
i
can
only
now
try
to
report
to
you
that
much
of
the
effect
of
affirming
the
decision
below.
i
believe
justice
powell
foresaw
it
when
he
asked,
how
do
you
know
if
you
made
a
gift?
i
would
just
add,
how
do
you
know
if
you've
used
your
annual
exclusion,
which
seems
to
have
some
effect
on
the
feeling
in
this
case?
if
you
can't
know
when
you've
used
your
annual
exclusion,
and
if
you
will,
one
more
thing...
two
more
things:
one
is,
since
1976
we
don't
have
separate
gift
tax
and
estate
taxes.
they're
combined.
the
estate
is
simply
the
last
gift.
but
since
1976
and
before
1976,
all
the
way
back
to
1932,
if
you
did
not
file
a
709,
a
gift
tax
return,
there's
no
statute
of
limitation.
if
this
court
allows
a
brand
new
concept
of
gift
to
come
into
the
taxing
picture,
there
literally
is
no
limit,
until
you
get
back
of
1932,
that
this
tax
can
place.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
sir,
justice.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
your
honor,
i
know
there's
a
case
that's
held
exactly
that
it
is
not
a
gift,
and
i
was
trying
with
my
co-counsel
desperately
to
find
it
when
it
came
up,
but
i
cannot
recall
it.
but
i
do
know
there's
a
case
in
the
tax
court
ruling
it
was
not
a
gift.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
well,
may
i
add
one
more
thing?
is
it
returnable
on
demand?
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
first,
lucas
v.
earl
would
tax
the
income
still
to
the
grantor
of
the
loan.
second,
again--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--yes,
sir,
under
the
lucas
versus
earl
case
of
this
court
many,
many
years
back.
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
gift,
again,
i've
been
concentrating
so
hard
on
these
loans,
i
would
only
be
speculating,
justice
stevens,
and
i've
learned
not
to
do
that
already
this
morning.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
yes,
sir.
let
me
layer
in
some
more
facts
into
your
question,
please.
one,
if
you
let
me
layer
in
the
premise
that
we
have
here
a
genuine
demand
situation.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
not
a
sham,
but
a
genuine
demand
proposition.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
okay,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
then
the
fact
of
what
the
grantee
does
with
the
funds
is
irrelevant
under
the
government's
theory.
and
my
answer
to
you
is
no,
sir,
that
theory
is
not
sound
and
it
is
not
in
the
statute.
the
thing
that
worried
me
about
your
hypo
is
that,
if
you
had
a
secret
agreement
that
this
would
be
done,
that
it
would
be
allowed
to
stay
out,
then
you're
into
the
sham
transaction
theory,
gregory
versus
helvering.
and
the
government
already
has
that
tool
to
fight
the
type
of
sham--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--no,
sir,
our
position
is
it
is
not
a
gift.
let
me--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
you're
getting
awfully
close
to
the
clifford
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
know,
though,
of
a
decision
applying
the
theory
of
clifford
under
income
tax
rules.
but
again--
mr.
frank
p.
riggs
--if
it
would
not
be
subject
to
income
tax.
our
problem
here
is
the
gift
tax.
i'm
not
that
sure...
fact
is,
in
the
crown
case
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
government
was
arguing
that
was
subject
to
income
tax
as
well
as
gift,
and
somehow
or
another
i
think
they
settled
it,
it
was
indicated
in
a
footnote
in
crown.
