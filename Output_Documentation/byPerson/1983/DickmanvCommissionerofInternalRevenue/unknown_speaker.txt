unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
if
these
were
term
notes,
not
demand
notes?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riggs,
when
you
responded
to
the
chief's
question
about
term
notes,
does
that
imply
a
term
note
at
no
interest?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riggs,
were
tax
lawyers
advising
their
clients
that
the
position
you
espouse
is
correct
before
the
crown
case?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
to
your
second
point,
about
the
reasonable
expectation
of
taxpayers,
and
i
wondered
whether
that
is
essentially
post-crown
decisions
effects.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
a
great
many
intra-family
loans
can
be
made
without
tax
consequences
under
the
provisions
for
the
annual
giving
without
tax
consequences
and
the
cumulative
life
exemption.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
file
a
return
if
you
make
gifts
that
are
within
the
exclusion?
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
the
father,
a
father,
owns
a
commercial
building
and
the
son
occupies
the
commercial
building,
conducting
a
business,
and
he
charges
no
rent.
would
the
reasonable
value
of
the
rent
of
that
property
be
taxable
as
a
gift
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
let
me
carry
the
hypothetical
one
step
beyond
that.
suppose
after
several
years
of
allowing
the
son
to
use
the
commercial
building
rent-free,
the
father
gives
him
a
quitclaim
deed.
taxable,
the
value
of
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference
in
terms
of
real
estate
transactions
in
the
law
of
real
estate
between
a
lease
which
conveys
part
of
the
property,
the
use
of
the
property,
and
the
property
itself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riggs,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
argument
essentially
to
be
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
tax
this
as
a
gift
it
should
have
said
so
specifically,
expressly?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
among
your
three...
i
gather
your
third
point
was
that
this
isn't
really
any
job
for
either
the
court
or
the
executive,
that
this
is
for
the
congress
to
straighten
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
in
preparing
for
this
oral
argument
i
ran
across
this.
i
wonder
if
you'd
comment
on
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
statement
by
a
very
respected
authority
on
federal
taxation:
"we
have
had
enough
experience
with
the
tax
laws
to
know
that
congress
cannot
do
everything
and
that
it
is
ordinarily
a
mistake
to
expect
the
congress
will
formulate
precise
rules
to
cover
every
refinement
and
detail
of
human
experience
so
far
as
its
tax
results
are
concerned.
"
"many
of
the
interstices
must
of
necessity
be
filled
in
by
the
courts
and
by
administrative
action.
"
unknown
speaker
mr.
riggs,
i
want
to
be
sure.
you're
conceding
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
tax
this
as
a
gift?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riggs,
back
up
a
minute.
you
say
that
a
demand
note
is
different
from
the
other
note
that
the
chief
justice--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
an
iou?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
on
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
on
it?
unknown
speaker
and
a
note
that
doesn't
have
a
term
specified
is
due
on
demand,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
carry
an
earlier
hypothetical
yet
a
third
step.
suppose
the
father
gives
the
son
a
99-year
lease
on
the
property.
now,
it's
still
a
lease.
there's
a
reversion.
unknown
speaker
taxable
as
a
gift?
unknown
speaker
let's
cut
it
down
to
50
years,
then.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
for
your
saying
that
a
lease
for
a
term
of
years
at
no
rent
is
not
a
gift?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
if
i
own
a
property
in
fee
simple
and
give
my
son
or
daughter
a
ten-year
lease
on
it,
that
that
is
not
a
gift?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
whole
definition
of
a
gift,
isn't
it,
the
transfer
of
a
property
interest
without
any
consideration?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
would
have
indicated
that
an
execution
of
a
lease
by
a
father
to
a
child
of
say
a
very
valuable
property,
commercial
property,
a
lease
for
20
years
free
of
any
rent,
wouldn't
be
a
gift.
maybe
i
misunderstood.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
gift
of
a
property
interest,
as
the
justice--
unknown
speaker
--but
even
if
it
were,
you
wouldn't
think
that
would
govern
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
the
solicitor
general
has
cited
a
number
of
cases,
has
he
not,
dealing
with
cases
arising
out
of
charitable
deductions
for
contributions
to
charities,
where
the
right
to
use
property
for
a
given
period
of
time
rent-free
has
been
treated
as
a
transfer
of
property
for
that
purpose?
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
authorities
in
accord
with
that
view,
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
no
analogy
necessarily
controls
a
concrete
situation.
but
it's
sometimes
helpful.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
would
you
define
how
you
think
the
phrase
"opportunity
to
use"
is
more
expansive
than
the
term
"use"?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
the
imputed
income
isn't
always
there.
but
if
there
is
a
market
interest
rate
for
money
at
a
given
time,
certainly
that
would
justify
the
service
in
saying
that
the
value
of
the
use
of
the
money
is
the
going
interest
rate,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
was
this
an
account
that
bore
interest?
unknown
speaker
was
this
joint
account
one
that
bore
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
applies,
your
principle
applies,
to
far
different
situations
than
that,
mr.
wallace,
doesn't
it?
the
example
cited
by
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
of
a
parent
loaning
a
child
$10,000
to
go
back
to
school
interest-free,
or
presumably
at
even
below
the
market
rate,
would
be
a
gift
in
the
government's
view.
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
we're
not
talking
about
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
tax
planning
alone.
we're
talking
about
some
very
common
transactions
that
people
would
have
had
no
thought
they
were
tax
planning
and
no
thought
that
they
were
making
gifts.
mr.
wallace,
responding
to
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
did
not
confine
your
response
to
money.
if
you
are
right,
it
applies
also
to
property.
unknown
speaker
and
when
you
get
into
the
property
area,
i'm
troubled
by
where
one
draws
the
line.
what
about
a
parent
lending
an
automobile?
the
parents
are
going
abroad
for
a
year.
you
use
the
term
"a
substantial
period
of
time"
in
your
brief.
what
is
a
substantial
period
of
time?
parents
or
friends
lend
a
summer
home
or
a
beach
cottage
or
whatever.
where
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
draw
the
line,
and
when
would
you
know,
when
would
you
ascertain
what
the
value
of
the
use
of
that
property
is?
it's
a
pandora's
box,
it
seems
to
me.
that's
why
i
want
you
to
shed
some
light
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
theoretically
any
different?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
transfers
in
this
case
defeat
the
application
of
the
gift
tax...
or
of
the
estate
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
must
follow
from
that
that
the
donor
has
some
sort
of
a
duty
to
invest,
to
build
up
his
estate
so
the
government
can
get
a
big
tax
bite
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
how
would
a
taxpayer
know
when
to
file
a
tax
return?
consider
the
hypotheticals
that
have
been
mentioned
here.
unknown
speaker
i'd
hate
to
be
his
tax
lawyer.
no,
i'd
like
to
be
one.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
what
happens
if
you
give
your
son
$250,000
with
a
demand
note
and
he
keeps
it
for
three
years,
and
then
you
fall
out
with
him
and
you
tell
him,
pay
up?
what
about
those
three
years?
was
that
a
gift?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
gift
as
long
as
you're
a
nice
boy.
but
when
you
became
a
bad
boy
it
wasn't
a
gift.
unknown
speaker
he'd
have
to
pay
for
the
three
years.
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
last
year.
unknown
speaker
my
only
point
was,
if
he
had
been
a
nice
boy
he
would
still...
no
gift.
unknown
speaker
so
he
gives
him
this
$250,000
every
year,
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
not
of
the
principal,
just
of
the
reasonable
interest,
the
going
rate.
unknown
speaker
under
the
government's
point
of
view,
mr.
wallace,
is
there
any
difference
really
between...
and
i'm
now
speaking
of
an
adult
son,
not
one
who
has
a
claim
for
support...
between
lending
$100,
we'll
say,
and
lending
$100,000,
except
that
irs
has
more
important
things
to
do
than
going
after
gift
taxes
on
the
$100
gift?
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
as
a
matter
of
principle,
from
your
point
of
view?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
mr.
wallace.
i
don't
know
whether
i
heard
your
answer
to
justice
powell's
question.
when
does
the
taxpayer
file
a
return?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question
based
on
something
of
personal
experience,
perhaps.
the
place
where
i
spend
part
of
my
summers
a
number
of
people...
it's
kind
of
a
summer
colony...
a
number
of
people
had
originally
a
cottage,
as
they
call
them,
near
a
lake.
and
as
their
kids
grow
and
have
families
of
their
own,
they've
built
themselves
what
they
call
a
grannie
cottage
and
turned
the
main
cottage
over
to
one
or
more
kids
in
the
summertime.
and
they
do
it
summer
after
summer
after
summer,
so
that
it's
not
just
a
one-shot
deal.
i
suppose
if
the
value
of
that
cottage
that
they
turn
over
to
a
kid
and
his
family
is
$1,000
per
summer,
that
sooner
or
later
they're
going
to
have
to
file
a
gift
tax
return?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about...
what's
the
total
you
can
give
to
any
one?
mr.
wallace,
isn't
$10,000
a
year
excluded
per
person,
and
if
you're
a
couple
isn't
it
$20,000
a
year
that
you
can
give
to
any
child?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
talking
about
big
dollars.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
the
service
did
not
seek
review
in
either
the
johnson
or
crown
cases,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
reason
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
finally
made
it.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
division
both
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
any
specific
attempt
by
the
service
to
get
specific
legislation
on
this?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
isn't
this
a
sort
of
recent
learning
on
the
commissioner's
part?
for
how
many
years
has
he
taken
this
position,
or
how
many
years
was
it
before
he
learned
about
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
commissioner
never
took
any
steps
in
this
direction
until
the
sixties,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
interest
rates
were
so
low
that
it
wasn't
worth
it
to
the
commissioner
to
file
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
if
your
position,
if
the
commissioner's
position,
is
correct
what
are
the
consequences
for
the
dean
income
taxability?
unknown
speaker
well,
will
we
be
back
here
hearing
the
commissioner
argue
for
a
different
result
there?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question
if
i
may,
mr.
wallace.
do
you
think
the
commissioner
has
statutory
authority
to
prescribe
certain
statutory
interest
rates
in
valuing
gifts?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
rely
on
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
what
if,
instead
of
being
an
interest-free
loan
in
this
case,
the
loan
were
made
at
the
rate
of
six
percent
and
the
commissioner
felt
that
the
going
rate
at
the
time
was
14
percent
for
an
unsecured
loan.
could
he
attack
that
transaction
in
your
view
the
same
way
he
attacks
this
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
as
i
understand
it
the
dimensions
of
this
problem
have
been
changed
with
the
increased
exemption
to
$10,000
and
$20,000.
unknown
speaker
but
the
donee
would
have
to
receive
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money
before
we'd
have
any
application
of
this.
unknown
speaker
about
how
much?
unknown
speaker
hundreds
of
thousands?
unknown
speaker
it
would
depend
on
whether
he
had
already
exceeded
his
allowance.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
under
your
position,
in
figuring
out
whether
you've
exceeded
your
allowance
you
have
to
include
these
things?
unknown
speaker
if
the
affluent
father
should
put
up
$100,000
worth
of
government
bonds
or
market
value
securities
to
secure
the
son's
loan
at
a
bank,
would
there
be
any
gift?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
value
of
the
use
of
the
security?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
measure
it?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
measure
the
value
of
a
demand
note
the
day
it's
given,
where
it's
just
on
demand?
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
all
gifts
normally
valued
at
the
time
the
gift
is
given?
unknown
speaker
let
me
change
the
hypothetical.
father
guarantees
the
loan
at
the
bank.
any
gift?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
just...
i'm
limiting
this
to
guaranteeing
payment.
until
he
had
to
act
on
that
to
fulfil
the
guarantee,
there'd
be
no
gift?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
riggs--
unknown
speaker
--the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
wallace
about
the
loan
of
securities
as
collateral
for
the
donee's
loan.
what
do
you
think
about
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
take
the
position
that,
say,
a
taxpayer
in
a
high
income
bracket
could
turn
over
a
portfolio
of
securities
to
someone
else
and
say,
i'm
just
loaning
these
to
you
and
you
just
keep
the
income,
and
then
when
i
want
them
back
you
give
them
back
to
me,
there'd
be
no
gift?
unknown
speaker
returnable
on
demand,
yes.
but
it's
to
their
tax
advantage
to
have
the
donee,
you
know,
being
in
a
lower
bracket--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
the
income
would
be
taxable
to
the
donor?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
turned
over
$200,000,
said,
you
keep
in
a
savings
account.
would
the
income
on
the
savings
account
be
taxable
to
the
grantor
in
your
view?
and
if
so,
why
isn't
the
income
on
these
loans
taxable
to
the
donor?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
sham
in
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
he's
entitled
to
the
money
whenever
he
wants
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
assuming
a
sham.
i'm
assuming
it
is,
you
keep
it
and
when
i
want
it
back
i'll
take
it
back,
and
then
the
son
or
the
corporation
says
okay.
there's
no
gift?
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
father's
letting
the
son
use
a
commercial
rental
property
that's
worth
$48,000
a
year,
we'll
say.
the
father's
income
and
his
taxable
base
is
reduced
by
that
amount
if
he's
not
receiving
that
rent
from
some
independent
source,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
the
son?
does
he
have
to
pay
any
income
tax
on
that?
