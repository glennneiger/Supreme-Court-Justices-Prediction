mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
say
a
word
first
in
response
to
some
questions
that
have
arisen.
the
commentary,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
in
the
journals
in
response
to
both
the
crown
decision
and
its
predecessor
district
court
decision
in
johnson...
and
we've
cited
many
of
these
commentaries...
were
almost
uniformly
critical
and
indicative
that
well-informed
tax
lawyers
did
not
believe
that
the
gift
tax
did
not
reach
demand
loans
of
this
kind.
during
this
early
period
when
interest
rates
were
low,
this
kind
of
device
in
tax
planning
was
not
widely
encountered.
there
wasn't
litigation
on
this
subject.
and
the
many
articles
cited...
one
amicus
brief
says
there
are
hundreds
of
articles
since
crown
advocating
this
device
for
tax
planning...
have
arisen
since
the
crown
decision.
this
court
in
commissioner
against
wemyss,
w-e-m-y-s-s,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
the
gift
tax
law
did
depart
from
the
common
law
of
what
constitutes
a
gift
and
instead
set
up
a
broad
statutory
definition.
perhaps
the
most
obvious
way
in
which
it
departed
from
the
common
law
is
in
section
2512(b)
of
the
code,
which
is
cited
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief,
which
says
that:
"where
property
is
transferred
for
less
than
an
adequate
and
full
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth,
then
the
amount
by
which
the
value
of
the
property
exceeded
the
value
of
the
consideration
shall
be
deemed
a
gift.
"
at
common
law,
if
there
was
consideration
it
wasn't
a
gift.
but
the
gift
tax
sets
up
its
own
definitions.
in
our
view,
this
case
presents
one
of
those
happy
situations
in
which
the
correct
answer
under
the
statute
coincides
with
the
common
sense
answer.
any
person
in
this
courtroom
would
find
it
a
valuable
benefit
to
be
given
gratuitously
an
unrestricted
right
to
use
several
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
would
be
a
gift.
and
the
subject
of
tuition--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
many
difficult
questions
under
the
gift
tax
law,
many
of
which
will
remain,
however
this
case
is
decided.
many
of
them
revolve
around
the
question
of
what
constitutes
support
for
dependents
that
traditionally
has
not
been
subjected
to
the
gift
tax,
and
these
questions
arise
whether
what
is
involved
is
a
loan
or
the
direct
payment
of
a
corpus
that
constitutes
support.
the
same
question
arises
with
respect
to
a
dependent
whether
you
allow
that
person
to
have
the
use
of
a
portion
of
your
residence
or
whether
you
supply
food
and
clothing
for
that
individual
which
is
consumed.
and
ordinarily,
the
congress
and
the
courts
and
the
commissioner
have
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
when
there's
a
legal
obligation
to
provide
support
the
provision
of
that
support
is
not
a
gift
subject
to
the
gift
tax.
what
if
it
goes
beyond
a
legal
obligation
to
a
moral
obligation?
these
are
difficult
questions.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
providing
the
ordinary
items
of
clothing,
even
if
they
may
be
provided
rather
lavishly,
and
providing
a
series
of
diamond
bracelets
which
become
a
means
of
transferring
wealth
from
one
generation
to
the
next.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
gift
tax,
which
was
to
supplement
the
estate
tax.
and
if
transfers
of
wealth
are
being
used
in
a
way
that
would
defeat
the
applicability
of
the
estate
tax
or
of
the
income
tax,
which
was
also
a
purpose,
then
there
is
more
of
a
problem
under
the
gift
tax
law
than
if
it's
the
ordinary
kind
of
consumption
of
property
where
the
donor
could
have
consumed
his
estate,
obviously,
on
more
frivolous
things,
but
instead
he's
providing
support
and
tuition
benefits
for
his
children,
but
it's
being
consumed
rather
than
passed
along.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
the
estate
tax.
well,
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
graphic
example,
because
what
is
being
transferred
here
is
the
ability
of
wealth
to
generate
additional
wealth.
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
obviously
can
be
invested
to
generate
additional
wealth,
and
if
they
were
so
invested
by
the
donor
that
additional
wealth
would
be
added
to
the
donor's
estate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
doesn't
have
to
follow,
in
our
view,
because
our
theory
of
the
gift
is
not
that
the
donor
has
foregone
an
accumulation
to
his
estate
and
that
constitutes
the
gift.
the
gift
is
the
value
of
what
is
given
on
the
market,
what
you
would
have
to
pay
for
it
if
it
weren't
given
to
you.
and
the
gift
here
is
the
right
to
use
that
money
which
the
donee
has
been
given.
and
it's
measured
the
same
way
as
a
gift
of
stock
would
be
measured.
the
gift
of
stock
is
not
measured
by
the
dividends
that
the
donor
otherwise
may
have
accumulated
in
his
estate,
which
is
a
speculative
matter.
the
value
is
what
the
donee
would
have
had
to
buy
the
stock
for
in
the
market
if
it
hadn't
been
given
to
him.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
gift
here.
it's
true
that
the
donor
might
not
have
made
good
use
of
that
money.
he
may
not
have
even
tried
to,
or
he
may
have
been
unsuccessful
in
using
it,
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
donee.
whatever
income
is
generated
by
the
gift
is
a
question
of
income
taxation.
but
the
gift
is
the
right
to
use
the
money,
and
that
has
its
own
value,
which
is
what
you
would
have
to
pay
for
the
right
to
use
that
money
if
it
weren't
given
to
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
only
with
good
tax
advice,
the
same
as--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
gifts
have
to
accumulate
to
a
certain
sum
per
person
before
there
is
any
responsibility
to
file
a
gift
tax
return.
and
obviously,
it
is
a
complex
tax
matter
these
days
for
an
estate
to
be
settled
when
the
decedent
has
had
a
substantial
estate,
and
that
is
a
time
when
there's
a
review
of
the
gift
tax
history
of
that
taxpayer.
these
are
complexities
that
we
have
under
the
law
that
congress
has
enacted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
certainly
was
a
gift
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we've
never
said
that
the
gift
is
the
gift
of
the
principal
and
that
that's
the
measure
of
the
gift.
what
the
gift
was
was
the
right
to
use
that
principal
for
as
long
as
the
donor
allowed
him
to
use
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
three
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
as
long
as
he
was
allowed
the
right
to
use
it
and
to
generate
whatever
income
he
could
from
it
by
whatever
means
he
chose.
he
might
have
been
unsuccessful
and
that's
another
question.
but
he
was
given
something
that
other
persons
did
not
have
and
would
have
to
pay
for,
which
was
the
right
to
use
that
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
would
still
have
the
same
gift.
the
gift
doesn't
depend
on
a
termination.
we
just
look
at
it
periodically
to
evaluate
it.
the
gift
is
an
ongoing
gift.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
gives
it
initially,
but
it's
an
ongoing
gift
for
as
long
as
he
forebears
asking
for
repayment
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
value
of
getting
the
use
of
that
money,
the
right
to
use
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
right,
and
there's
a
yearly
exclusion.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
rest
of
the
exclusion
were
consumed
with
other
gifts,
they
could
as
a
matter
of
principle
say
that
this
is
the
little
bit
that
put
you
over
the
top
and
there's
a
gift
tax
liability
for
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he's
required
to
file
a
return
if
he
has
made
gifts
during
the
year
that
reach
the
level
that
is
not
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
$1,000
per
year
is
excluded
from
the
gift
tax.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
talking
about
big
dollars
before
you
incur
any
gift
tax
liability,
unless
you
have
given
those
big
dollars
in
other
ways
and
this
is
the
amount
that
would
put
you
over
the
top.
that
could
happen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
didn't
seek
review
beyond
the
court
of
appeals
level
in
the
crown
case,
because
we
had
no
conflict
in
the
circuits
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
ordinary
practice
in
tax
litigation,
is
to
try
to
develop
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
although
the
crown
case
was
a
tempting
one
because
it
involved
$15
million
in
interest-free
loans.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
finally...
we
developed
our
conflict
in
the
circuits
and
we're
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
we
had
dissents
in
both
courts.
but
we
do
find
we're
inhibited
in
trying
to
develop
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
if
this
court
has
denied
certiorari
on
the
issue
on
our
petition.
so
there
can
be
a
price
to
pay
for
petitioning
on
the
first
decision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
recent
testimony
on
the
subject
which
is
cited
in
petitioner's
reply
brief.
that
testimony
did
specifically
indicate
that
the
matter
was
pending
before
this
court
in
the
dickman
case
for
decision
on
the
gift
tax
question.
and
we
find
that
congress
seldom
acts
before
this
court
has
resolved
a
pending
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
pertinent
revenue
ruling
was
in
1973,
although
the
question
was
litigated
in
the
johnson
case
in
1966.
but
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
terms
of
the
regulations
adopted
both
in
1932
and
even
more
so
in
1936
did
embrace
this
kind
of
situation,
even
though
they
didn't
refer
specifically
to
loans
or
demand
loans.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
that
we're
aware
of.
but
during
those--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
probably
so.
it's
hard
to
speak
authoritatively
about
this,
but
interest
rates
were
low.
this
was
not
a
commonly
used
and
certainly
not
a
trumpeted
device
of
tax
planning.
there
were
many
other
matters
to
be
litigated
under
the
gift
tax
law,
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
the
gift
tax
law
indicate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
it's
a
separate
question,
although
we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
have
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
think
the
dean
case
and
the
others
that
have
gone
the
same
way
were
wrongly
decided.
but
there
so
many
courts
have
gone
against
our
position
that
that
was
really
the
main
topic
of
the
recent
testimony
before
congress,
that
they
ought
to
take
action
because
we've
been
unsuccessful
in
trying
to
develop
a
conflict
under
the
tax
laws.
even
though
it
seems
fairly
clear
to
us
that
when
an
employer,
whether
it's
a
corporation
or
otherwise,
gives
an
employee
an
interest-free
loan
that
is
a
form
of
compensation
which
amounts
to
income
for
the
employee,
we've
had
difficulty
getting
that
position
accepted
by
the
courts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
he
does
have
statutory
authority
to
prescribe
at
least
the
method
in
arriving
at
the
valuation
of
gifts,
including
specifying
safe
harbor
rates
that
would
be
generally
applicable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
don't
have
in
the
materials
before
us
the
provisions
of
the
code
that
grant
the
regulatory
authority,
but
they
are
in
the
internal
revenue
code
and
they're
the
same
provisions
that
have
authorized
the
myriad
regulations
the
commissioner
has
adopted,
including
regulations
about
accounting
methods
that
have
to
be
used
in
various
kinds
of
business
transactions.
there
have
been
different
rates
specified
by
the
commissioner
in
asserting
deficiencies
in
this
area,
partly
reflecting
differences
in
prevailing
rates
of
interest
at
the
time,
but
also
partly
reflecting
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case,
because
the
demand
loan
varies
in
its
market
value
depending
on
the
credit
status
of
the
borrower.
a
borrower
who
may
not
be
in
a
good
position
to
relay
the
demand
may
have
to
pay
a
bank
considerably
more
for
a
demand
loan
if
he's
likely
not
to
be
able
to
respond
promptly
to
the
demand
and
come
across
with
the
principal,
than
another
borrower
who
is
a
better
credit
risk.
and
these
situations
vary
in
the
gift
tax
cases
as
well.
but
we
do
emphasize
the
breadth
of
the
statutory
language
congress
used...
it's
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief...
and
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
1932
committee
reports
in
adopting
that
language,
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
terms
"property",
"transfer",
"gift",
and
"directly
or
indirectly"
are
used
in
their
broadest
and
most
comprehensive
sense,
to
reach
every
species
of
right
or
interest
protected
by
law
and
having
an
exchangeable
value.
and
the
right
to
use
this
money
for
as
long
as
the
donor
permits
is
a
property
right
in
the
sense
that
it's
protected
by
law.
if
it's
deposited
by
the
donee
in
an
interest-bearing
account,
he
has
a
legal
right
against
the
bank
or
against
any
other
third
party
to
the
use
of
those
funds
under
the
terms
of
the
account,
and
he
has
a
right
to
the
proceeds
even
against
the
donor
himself,
as
well
as
against
all
properties.
so
it
is
a
species
of
property
protected
by
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
set
forth
the
contemporaneous
treasury
regulations
in
our
brief,
and
on
page
12
and
13
we
have
discussed
in
particular
the
1936
regulation
which
refers
to
the
enjoyment
of
property
which
is
not
itself
fully
transferred,
but
the
right
to
enjoy
it
is
transferred
and
subject
to
the
gift
tax,
which
fits
the
concept
of
what
we
have
here
even
though
there
was
no
specific
reference
to
a
loan
here.
the
principal
is
a
loan
rather
than
a
gift,
but
the
enjoyment
in
this
case
is
the
right
to
use
that
money
during
the
time
in
which
the
donor
doesn't
require
the
principal
to
be
repaid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
certainly
could.
whether
or
not
successfully
would
depend
on
whether
he
could
prove
that
it
came
within
the
statutory
criterion
of
property
transferred
for
less
than
an
adequate
and
full
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth.
that
is
the
criterion
congress
has
specified,
as
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
yes,
the
applicability
has
been
changed,
that
is
correct.
there's
exclusion
of
the
value
of
the
gift,
but
the
principal
could
be
much
larger.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
be
many
hundreds
of
thousands.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
year.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
year.
if
there
were
other
gifts
that
year,
you
know,
they
too
add
up.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
they
seem
to
us
squarely
to
come
within
the
statutory
definition
and
the
definitions
in
the
committee
reports
and
in
the
regulations,
and
they
are
obviously
a
means
of
transferring
wealth
to
one's
intended
beneficiaries
in
a
way
that
would
exclude
the
likelihood
of
additional
estate
tax
liability,
in
a
way
that
transfers
income
tax
liability
on
any
further
income
that's
generated
from
the
donor,
who
is
likely
to
be
in
a
higher
income
tax
bracket,
to
the
donee.
so
they
come
squarely
within
the
purpose,
as
well
as
the
broad
language,
of
the
gift
tax
law.
and
i
would
like
to
be
sure
that
the
theory
of
the
government
is
well
understood
here,
because
it
has
erroneously
been
argued
that
we
are
in
some
way
doubling
the
taxation
of
income
that's
generated.
the
value
of
the
gift
is
not
the
income
that
is
generated
by
that
property.
the
way
we
value
and
tax
the
gift
is
precisely
the
way
we
would
with
a
gift
of
stock,
by
its
market
value,
here
the
market
value
of
the
right
to
use
the
money.
if
the
stock
does
in
fact
generate
dividends,
that
is
a
separate
matter
that
is
taxed
under
the
income
tax
law.
if
the
donor
had
retained
the
stock
he
would
pay
income
tax
on
dividends
that
are
generated,
and
if
the
stock
is
given
to
the
donee
he
pays
income
tax
on
any
dividends
that
are
generated.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
any
income
generated
by
the
use
of
the
money.
it
in
no
way
duplicates
the
tax
on
the
gift,
which
is
the
transfer
of
the
right
to
use
that
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would,
in
the
use
of
that
money,
of
that
security
that
would
otherwise
be
available,
whatever
the
market--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--whatever
it
would
cost
someone
to
get
it
if
it
weren't
given
to
him,
the
same
as
the
value
of
any
other
gift.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
what
it
would
cost
you
to
get
someone
to
put
it
up
for
you
if
you
didn't
have
someone
willing
to
give
it
to
you.
it
might...
it
would
take
expert
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
talked
about
the
method
of
valuing
it.
it
can
only
be
valued
periodically
and
in
retrospect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
so
is
this.
but
this
is
an
ongoing
gift.
it's
not
just
a
gift
that
takes
place
at
the
one
time
when
it's
first
given,
because
the
extent
of
the
gift
can
only
be
known
by
how
long
the
donor
forebears
in
asking
for
it
to
be
returned.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
probably
not
in
that
situation,
although
it
could
be
argued
that
there's
a
market
value.
there
would
be
a
gift,
however,
if
father
paid
the
interest
for
the
loan,
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there's
no
property
being
transferred
to
the
donee
in
that
situation.
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
footnote
24
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
in
that
dissent
in
the
tax
court
in
the
crown
case,
judge
simpson,
joined
by
judges
romm
and
tamm
and
wald
and
wilbur,
did
equate
this
situation
with
the
situation
where
the
donor
arranged
for
a
bank
to
provide
the
use
of
these
funds
to
the
donee
and
paid
the
interest.
and
it's
an
economically
equivalent
situation
and
there
is
the
same
gift
under
contemplation
of
the
gift
tax.
