justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
the
same
vein,
you
mentioned
at
the
outset
that
you
never
reviewed
the
time
records
because
they
weren't
your
client
and
the
court
should
probe
deeply
into
the
time
records.
did
you
not
have
an
opportunity
to
have
discovery
on
the
time
records?
did
you
take
advantage
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
specifically
object
to
the...
do
you
question
the
hours
they
spent,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
raise
any
question
about
the
integrity
of
the
time
records
and
the
number
of
hours
they
claimed
to
have
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
did
you
deny
that
they
actually
spent
the
time
they
say
they
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can
assume
that
the
time
records
are
genuine
and
not
in
dispute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
silverman,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
that
you
went
by
rather
rapidly
earlier?
in
the
second
circuit,
as
i
read
their
just
two-page
order,
they
dealt
with
three
issues,
none
of
which
was
this
issue.
to
what
extent
was
this
issue
raised
in
the
second
circuit,
if
you
could
please
tell
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
did
they
argue--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
court?
did
you
take
a
position
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
the
correct
hourly
rate
should
have
been?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
said
this
was
too
high?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
so
you
really
don't
have
a
position
on
what...
you
say
he
is
wrong
on
what
the
hourly
rate
is,
but
you
don't
tell
us
what
is
right.
but
you
are
telling
us
how
to
figure
it.
