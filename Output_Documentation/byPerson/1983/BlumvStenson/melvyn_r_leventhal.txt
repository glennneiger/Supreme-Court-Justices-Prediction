mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
the
state
of
new
york
challenges
a
fee
award
entered
against
it
under
a
fee
shifting
statute.
an
award
of
approximately
$150
an
hour,
consisting
of
a
$100
base
rate
and
a
50
percent
multiplier,
was
granted
three
young
attorneys
with
an
average
experience
of
two
years
when
comparable
attorneys
working
for
major
wall
street
firms
were
being
billed
to
commercial
clients
at
the
rate
of
$70
an
hour.
the
question
presented
is
whether
$150
an
hour
for
attorneys
without
any
billing
experience
and
working
for
non-profit
organizations
is
reasonable,
and
more
specifically,
what
standards
and
procedures
should
control
the
inquiry,
and
what
standards
and
procedures
were
not
followed
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
the
critical
theme
in
our
argument
derives
from
the
fact
that
we
are
proceeding
under
a
fee
shifting
statute.
that
is
the
one
aspect
of
the
case
that
permeates
our
argument.
the
state
of
new
york
did
not
enter
the
marketplace
to
hire
an
attorney.
there
was
no
competition
among
lawyers
for
our
business.
we
didn't
negotiate
an
hourly
rate.
we
never
reviewed
their
time
records
before
the
bill
was
submitted.
we
never
monitored
their
work.
we
didn't
develop
a
relationship
of
trust
with
plaintiff's
counsel.
two
years
after
the
litigation
began,
plaintiffs
moved
for
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees,
and
the
district
court
has
ordered
us
to
pay
every
nickel
requested
by
the
plaintiffs.
because
we
are
working
under
a
fee
shifting
principle,
the
district
court
has
a
duty
to
probe
deeply
into
the
fee
application
of
plaintiff's
counsel,
and
because
we
have
a
fee
shifting
statute,
the
standards
and
procedures
that
must
be
developed
by
this
court
must
recognize
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
a
captive
payor.
if
the
state
of
new
york
had
had
a
voice--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--that's
correct.
the
principle
applies
in
every
fee
shifting
statute.
the
difficult
question
presented
is
how
should
the
hourly
rate
be
calculated
for
attorneys
without
relevant
billing
experience,
who
don't
have
a
normal
billing
rate,
who
work
for
profit
and
non-profit
law
firms.
there
have
been
developed
three
approaches
to
this
question
in
our
judgment.
the
first
is
a
fictional
market
approach
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
it
is
almost
a
fanciful
approach.
under
it,
the
court
asks
for
information
on
awards
granted
in
other
civil
rights
cases
or
in
other
cases
that
the
court
finds
comparable.
when
it
does
so,
it
doesn't
ask
whether
there
was
any
information,
any
evidence
submitted
in
those
case
which
establish
what
the
market
rate
is,
and
in
fact
the
court
below,
by
way
of
illustration,
relied
upon
becker
versus
blum,
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
awarded
$75
an
hour
for
lawyers
with
less
than
two
years'
experience
and
$90
an
hour
for
lawyers
with
more
than
two
years'
experience,
without
any
evidence
of
what
the
market
rate
is.
and
in
fact,
in
that
case,
the
only
comment
of
the
district
court
was
that
the
legal
services
corporation
should
have
asked
for
more,
but
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case
of
what
is
in
fact
a
market
rate.
we
therefore
view
it
as
entirely
fictional.
the
second
approach--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--your
honor,
we
raised
in
the
lower
court
a
claim
that
the
fee
award
was
exorbitant,
and
we
argued
in
the
second
circuit
for
the
first
time
that
hourly
rates
should
be
based
upon
costs.
but
throughout
this
litigation
we
have
argued
for...
under
different
theories
that
whatever
the
rate
granted
to
the
plaintiff's
counsel
in
this
case,
it
was
excessive.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
it
is
our
view
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
producing
time
records
and
of
producing
evidence
of
proper
market
rate,
of
an
hourly
rate
that
is
appropriate.
we
did
object,
and
in
response
the
plaintiffs
filed
supplemental
affidavits
which
we
found
inadequate.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
claim
that
the
number
of
hours
they
claimed
were
excessive.
on
page
19
of
our
reply
brief,
we
set
forth--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
what
was
filed
with
the
district
court
was
an
affidavit
listing
the
hours
expended
by
counsel.
if
you
are
talking
about
time
records,
contemporaneous
time
records--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct.
they
claimed
that
contemporaneous
time
records
were
available
for
a
good
number
of
the
hours
expended,
and
they
conceded
that
for
a
good
number
of
the
hours
expended
there
were
no
contemporaneous
time
records.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
that
is
one
approximation.
in
the
lamb
case,
a
tenth
circuit
decision
recently
entered,
ramos
versus
lamb,
the
tenth
circuit
estimated
1,400
to
1,600
hours
was
the
average
expenditure
of
time
in
a
year
by
a
lawyer
in
a
private
firm.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
indeed
they
can,
your
honor,
and
that
is
relevant--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--$150
an
hour
total,
a
$100
base
rate
and
a
50
percent
multiplier.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor,
it
is
$100
plus
50
percent.
the
second
approach
that
has
been
used
by
the
lower
courts
is
a
bona
fide
market
rate
approach,
and
in
those
cases
there
is
a
meaningful
effort
to
obtain
information
on
what
is
in
fact
a
market
rate
for
a
given
attorney.
the
third
approach,
a
cost
basis--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--your
honor,
the
courts
have
struggled
with
that.
i
am
not
saying
that
they
have
in
fact
achieved
any
degree
of
certainty.
all
i
am
conceding
at
this
moment
is
that
there
is
a
meaningful
effort
to
obtain
such
information.
but
we
think
that
it
has
been
largely
speculative,
and
i
will
very
briefly
get
to
why
i
believe
it
is
speculative.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we've
ever
calculated
that.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
think
that
a
reasonable
approach
would
entail
paying
an
attorney
for
the
value
of
his
time
based
upon
his
counterpart
at
a
private
law
firm
plus
a
percentage
of
the
non-profit
organization's
overhead
attributable
to
that
particular
attorney.
in
that
way,
we
recognize
the
value
of
the
attorney
in
the
marketplace.
we
are
saying
if
that
attorney
had
worked
at
a
law
firm,
he
would
have
obtained
a
certain
annual
salary.
we
will
recognize
that
salary
in
our
approach.
we
will
add
to
it
a
percentage
of
the
firm's
overhead
attributable
to
that
attorney
on
an
hourly
basis.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
the
critical
deficiency
in
the
market
rate
approach,
even
one
that
entails
a
meaningful
effort
to
obtain
solid
information,
is
that
the
taxpayers
of
new
york
are
not
to
be
forced
to
pay
two
aspects
of
that
market
rate
that
produce
windfalls
to
a
non-profit
lawyer.
first,
there
is
a
profit
component
in
a
market
rate.
based
upon
an
appreciation
of
the
risks
a
business
assumed,
to
create
a
long
relationship
with
clients,
to
develop
a
business
over
many
years.
the
senior
partners
of
a
law
firm
demand
a
percentage
of
an
hourly
rate
as
their
profit.
we
don't
think
the
taxpayers
ought
to
be
forced
to
carry
that
part
of
the
market
rate.
secondly,
there
is
an
overhead
component
in
the
market
rate
that
we
think
results
in
windfalls,
in
excessive
awards.
the
overhead
component
might
be
appropriate
for
a
major
wall
street
firm
that
has
huge
dollars
at
stake
in
a
controversy,
in
a
litigated
matter,
and
is
impelled
by
the
demands
of
its
client
to
provide
unusual
services.
we
don't
feel
the
taxpayers
of
new
york
when
billed
by
the
legal
aid
society
ought
to
have
to
pay
those
two
aspects,
those
two
elements
of
the
market
rate.
the
approach
we
urge
on
the
court--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--they
go
to
the
society,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
there
is
no
dispute.
the
cost
based
approach
that
we
urge
upon
the
court
was
articulated
in
large
part
by
the
third
circuit
in
rodriguez
versus
taylor
and
recently
adopted
by
judge
friendly
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
new
york
association
of
retarded
children
versus
kerry.
that
cost
based
approach
is
the
one
i
described
to
you,
mr.
justice
marshall,
entailing
a
component
reflecting
the
value
of
the
attorney
plus
some
overhead.
it
is
not
a
complex
computation.
it
is
in
touch
with
the
reality
of
a
non-profit
organization.
it
achieves
moderation,
which
we
believe
is
required
by
the
congress
under
this
fee
shifting
statute.
we
believe
it
will
attract
competent
counsel,
and
at
the
same
time
protect
against
the
windfall
element
in
the
market
rate
approach.
the
calculation,
to
give
you
an
easy
example
of
it,
if
an
attorney
with
two
years'
experience
at
the
legal
aid
society
could
have
made
$48,000
at
a
private
firm,
and
billed
1,600
hours
a
year...
i
would
use
2,000,
your
honor,
but
my
notes
show
1,600...
that
would
produce
a
30-hour
rate
for
that
attorney,
and
it
would
reflect
the
value
of
that
attorney
had
he
sold
his
services
to
a
private
firm.
if
at
the
same
time
the
non-profit
organization
had
overhead
of
$5
million,
and
it
employed
100
lawyers,
then
we
could
estimate
the
overhead
per
hour
attributable
to
that
lawyer
as
approximately
$30
or
$31
an
hour,
leading
to
an
hourly
rate
of
$60
or
$61
an
hour.
that
approach
has
been
recommended
by
judge
friendly
as
appropriate
under
the
statute.
the
opposition's
principal
claim
is
that
the--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--that
amount?
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
it
is
a
figure
i
am
giving
for
my
hypothetical.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
it
is
entirely
speculative.
i
have
just
pulled
that
$1
million
or
whatever
million
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
am
simply
illustrating
that
it
is
an
easy
computation
to
make.
now,
the
opposition's
principal
claim
is
that
this
cost
based
approach
is
too
complicated
and
it
is
too
intrusive.
that
is
their
principal
argument.
we
insist
that
it
is
no
more
complicated
and
no
more
intrusive
than
the
market
rate.
market
rates
are
not
easy
to
calculate.
they
require
knowledge
of
the
financial
structure
of
the
law
firm,
who
gets
what
profit
in
what
amounts.
a
market
rate
would
vary
with
the
benefit
to
the
client.
the
market
rate
would
vary
based
upon
the
previous
experience
given
to
the
firm
by
the
client.
the
market
rate
would
vary
based
upon
the
business
the
firm
expected
to
obtain
from
the
client,
and
the
market
rate
would
vary
from
client
to
client
and
from
service
to
service.
that
is
a
very
intrusive
series
of
variables.
as
the
copeland
court
recognized
in
its
very
brief
discussion
of
this
market
rate,
that
inquiry
could
be
very
intrusive
because
it
can
require
documentation,
it
could
require
what
the
court
referred
to
as
other
submissions,
and
it
can
require
a
hearing,
and
a
very
complex
hearing.
in
a
recent
decision,
this
ramos
versus
lamb
decision,
the
tenth
circuit
noted
that
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
sought
a
fee
award
of
approximately
$700,000,
$700,000,
$800,000.
the
experts
produced
in
that
case
disagreed
to
the
tune
of
$500,000
on
what
a
reasonable
market
rate
would
be
for
those
attorneys.
so
the
notion
that
somehow
a
market
rate
is
easy
to
calculate
is
only
true
when
we
take
the
fanciful
approach
of
simply
referring
to
other
cases.
when
you
get
down
to
trying
to
calculate
it,
it
is
very
complicated.
it
is
very
intrusive.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
think
all
we
have
to
establish,
your
honor,
is
that
they
are
not
more
difficult
to
ascertain.
i
am
not
certain.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
are
not
more
difficult
to
ascertain
than
a
market
rate,
and
if
our
approach
also
eliminates
windfalls,
a
critical
objective
of
congress,
our
approach
is
superior.
the
second
major
argument,
and
i
frankly
think
of
it
as
a
subsidiary
argument,
is
the
legislative
intent
argument.
counsel
insist
that
congress
intended
to
produce
what
we
see
as
a
windfall
award.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
a
windfall
in
that
it
is
paid
more
than
a
reasonable
hourly
rate.
in
this
case
it
was
much
more
than
the
private
firm.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
it
is
a
windfall
because
when
you
look
at
the--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
indeed,
justice
white.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
sir.
the
key
feature
of
the
legislative
history
or
the
key
holding
of
our
congress
as
the
court
recognized
last
term
was
that
competent
counsel
must
be
attracted
to
these
cases.
the
objective
of
the
congress
was
to
assure
access
to
the
judicial
process.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
think
the
fee
award
would
have
to
be
higher.
we
still
think
it
would
have
to
be
moderate,
but
it
would
indeed
be
higher.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
think
the
private
practitioner
is
entitled
to
profit,
while
the
non-profit
organization
ought
not
to
be.
we
think
that
both
inquiries,
however,
have
to
be
guided
by
the
notion
of
moderation.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
the
courts
have
held
that,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
court
has
held
that
a
bonus
for
contingency
is
improper
because
it
compensates
counsel
for
the
cases
it
has
lost.
indeed,
as
the
court
held
last
term,
the
notion
of
paying
a
lawyer
for
time
expended
when
he
loses,
when
the
winning
party
has
to
pay
the
loser,
as
the
court
said
in
the
sierra
club
case,
it
suggests
unfairness
to
the
litigants,
and
it
is
inappropriate.
in
fact,
we
think
that
the
notion
of
a
contingency
adjustment
is
inconsistent
with
the
critical
holding
last
term
that
ordinarily
an
hourly
rate
times
hours
expended
results
in
a
reasonable
hourly
rate.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct,
but
we
don't
think--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole
illustrates
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
market
rate
fees
be
awarded.
in
fact,
all
that
congress
intended
was
that
the
judicial
process
be
available
to
the
plaintiffs,
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
the
objective
of
congress
was
to
eliminate
barriers
to
plaintiffs
obtaining
redress
from
the
judicial
process.
it
did
not
require
that
counsel
be
paid
the
highest
fees
available
in
the
market
place.
it
did
not--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--one
would
be
entitled
to
more,
your
honor.
the
attorney
of
the
profit-making
organization
would--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
if
he
had
different
overhead,
we
feel
that
difference
should
be
reflected
in
the
fee
award.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--first
of
all,
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
that
many
cases
where
there
are
three
lawyers
from
three
different
firms.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
case
could
entail--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
they
are
very
different.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
think
there
can
be
three
different
fee
awards,
but
we
don't
think
the
complicated
calculation
is
required.
we
think
that
there
can
be
estimates
of
hours...
of
overhead,
and
estimates
of
profit
margin.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
am
saying
it
is
entitled
to
get
its
overhead,
which
can
be
defined
as
including
some
amount
of
money
to
other
partners
of
the
law
firm.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
or
other
associates.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
think
they
often
buy
lawyers
wholesale
and
sell
them
retail.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
have
several
different
rates
to
avoid
windfalls.
it
just
seems...
we
do
have
to
attract
private
counsel
to
these
cases,
and
to
attract
them
we--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--your
honor,
under
the
statute
it
is
a
windfall.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
your
honor,
somebody
might,
but
the
fact
is
i
am
talking
about
the
word
"windfall"
as
it
is
used
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
and
what
the
congress
intended
windfall
to
mean
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
think
that
illustrates
our
point,
your
honor,
and
to
this
day--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--your
honor,
most
wall
street
firms
continue
to
take
cases
pro
bono.
one
of
the
cases
we
cited,
mccane,
involved
a
case
taken
pro
bono
by
a
major
firm
in
which
it
said
to
the
district
court,
pay
us
whatever
you
want.
the
fact
is,
the
problem
that
the
state
of
new
york
faces--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
your
honor.
when
we
look
at
this
private
practitioner,
it
is
of
great
concern
to
the
state
that
we
do
look
at
his
overhead,
and
that
there
be
differences.
the
fact
is,
we
have
fee
applications
pending
against
the
state
of
new
york
right
now
where
attorneys
have
worked
out
of
their
homes,
or
attorneys
have
worked
out
of
a
one-room
office
with
a
telephone
answering
machine,
and
they
are
seeking
fees
that
might
be
identical
to
a
lawyer
with
substantially
more
overhead.
it
is
relevant
that
their
overhead
is
substantially
less
than
other
lawyers
working
downtown.
we
are
also
concerned
that
lawyers
look
to
obtain
their
highest
opportunity
fee
when
they
bill
the
state
of
new
york.
the
fact
is
that
lawyers
don't
operate
that
way.
the
fact
is
that
lawyers
charge
different
hourly
rates
at
different
times
and
for
different
clients,
and
we
think
it
is
unreasonable
for
an
attorney
to
be
seeking
a
fee
based
upon
the
highest
fee
he
has
ever
recovered,
or
the
highest
hourly
rate
he
has
ever
billed.
the
critical
arguments
raised
by
the
opposition
are
that
congress
intended
that
the
fee
awards
be
in
our
judgment
unreasonable,
that
the
fee
awards
not
be
measured
by
neutral
principles.
they
argue
that
rigidity
is
required.
we
think
that
is
inappropriate.
secondly,
they
don't
argue
that
cost
based
rates
are
unreasonable.
there
is
not
a
whisper
in
their
brief
that
costs
are
irrelevant.
they
simply
say
that
costs
are
too
complicated
and
too
intrusive,
when
in
fact
the
evidence
shows
that
they
are
no
more
complicated
and
no
more
intrusive
than
the
alternative
market
rates.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
present
calculation
of
hourly
rates
and
amounts
of
award
are
rough
estimates
in
many,
many
respects.
when
attorneys
duplicate
time,
the
courts
have
authorized
downward
adjustments
for
that
duplication
of
rough
percentages.
when
attorneys
don't
maintain
contemporaneous
time
records,
the
court
has
said
there
can
be
rough
adjustments.
last
term,
in
hensley,
this
court
authorized
a
30
percent
adjustment
for
failure
to
maintain
contemporaneous
time
records.
no
precision
was
required.
last
term
the
court
said
that
when
a
party
does
not
prevail
on
all
claims
there
can
be
a
downward
adjustment
of
the
hourly
rate
and
the
award.
no
one
talked
about
precision
in
figuring
out
exactly,
mathematically,
or
with
cost
accounting
the
extent
to
which
a
claimant,
an
attorney
lost
or
won
a
case.
this
court
expressly
held
that
the
downward
adjustment
was
fully
at
the
option
of
the
district
court.
we
have
had
downward
adjustment
authorized
for
inefficiency,
without
mathematical
precision.
we
have
no
mathematical
precision
in
the
market
rate.
yet
when
the
state
of
new
york
asks
for
protection
from
windfalls,
we
are
presented
with
an
argument
that
we
need
cost
accounting.
that
is
not
a
fair
approach
to
the
case.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
the
state.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
the
courts
have
held
that
we
are
under
those
circumstances
required
to
look
at
the
ability
of
the
legal
aid
society
to
pay.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
i
think
we
can
estimate
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
your
honor,
in
the
last...
in
the
willowbrook
case
judge
newman,
speaking
for
the
court,
talked
about
a
breakpoint,
a
way
of
accommodating
costs
without
a
rough
calculation.
he
said
that
we
can
estimate
a
$75
hourly
rate
as
including
costs
that
might
be
appropriate
for
a
smaller
firm
or
for
a
non-profit
organization.
let
me
add,
too,
that
when
mr.
silverman
said
that
the
rates
for
a
first
year
associate
are
$65
to
$85,
that
is
not
a
market
rate.
that
is
his
rate.
the
market
is
huge.
there
are
firms
with
two
lawyers
in
it,
with
three
lawyers
in
it,
with
50
lawyers
in
it,
with
100
lawyers.
have
we
ever
tried
to
calculate
a
market
rate
based
upon
the
entire
spectrum
of
the
marketplace?
no
court
has
ever
tried
that.
but
if
you
want
to
get
a
true
market
rate,
that
is
what
is
required.
how
would
we
calculate
that?
let
me
go
to
this
question
of
the
contingency
adjustment.
it
might
very
well
be
that
the
underlying
hourly
rate
should
include
some
element
for
contingency
that
is
far
different
from
increasing
an
award
by
50
percent
because
of
a
contingency.
perhaps
the
hourly
rate
might
reflect
some
consideration
of
contingency.
there
are
other
parts
of
the
upward
adjustment
made
by
the
district
court
that
are
more
obviously
inappropriate.
the
court
said
that
there
was
an
upward
adjustment
because
of
complexity.
last
term
the
court
said
that
those
upward
adjustments
are
often
subsumed
in
the
underlying
award.
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
that.
this
court
granted
an
hourly
rate,
saying
the
case
was
complex.
he
allowed
a
number
of
hours
expended
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
complex,
and
then
he
tripled
it,
forced
the
state
to
pay
a
third
time
for
complexity,
by
saying
that
there
is
an
upward
adjustment
for
complexity.
three
times
complexity
was
included
in
the
hourly
rate
and
the
total
award.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
said
it
was
too
high
and
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
burden
of
establishing
what
the
market
rate
is.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
and
we
are
saying
at
bottom
that
it
is
improper
to
bill
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
non-profit
organization
for
the
time,
for
that
part
of
the
award
that
goes
to
pay
a
profit
to
a
partner
in
a
firm
and
that
goes
to
pay
the
fancy
overhead
of
a
major
firm.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor,
we
have
not,
but
in
the
willowbrook
case,
we
have
found
acceptable
an
hourly
rate
of
$75
an
hour,
the
breakpoint
rate.
we
have
not
pursued
that
further,
and
expect
to
pay
approximately
$700,000
to
the
civil
liberties
union
and
the
legal
aid
society
within
a
few
weeks.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
that's
correct.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
if
we
can
adjust--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--we
would
not
go
to
a
prevailing
market
rate.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
we
would--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--we
would
estimate
it,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
on
the
basis
of
the
total
costs,
the
total
overhead
of
the
law
firm.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
well,
cost
accounting,
if
you
mean
a
complex--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--yes,
your
honor.
it
would
vary
based
upon
that.
the
court--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--to
the
legal
aid
society?
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
at
the
very
least,
a
very
small
law
firm
with
low
overhead.
that
is
the
critical
point.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
low
overhead.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
a
small
one.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
no,
your
honor,
but
we
think
that--
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
--two
years.
mr.
melvyn
r.
leventhal
the
point
is,
your
honor,
that
the
plaintiffs
haven't
come
up
with
an
hourly
rate
either,
a
market
rate.
