mr.
leon
silverman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
before
launching
into
my
argument
to
have
some
general
principles
up
front.
one
is
the
result
of
this
lawsuit.
in
this
case,
114,000
persons
over
a
35-month
period
were
illegally
deprived
of
their
medicaid
benefits.
if
one
makes
a
modest
assumption
that
each
of
those
persons
who
had
been
kicked
off
the
roles
illegally
was
off
the
roles
for
just
one
month,
then...
and
if
you
make
the
further
assumption,
which
is
mathematically
computable
by
one
of
the
appendixes
in
our
lodgement,
that
the
average
monthly
cost
is
$100
per
person,
then
the
class
was
deprived
of
$317,000
a
month,
or
$3,500,000
a
year,
and
the
society
gained
for
its
clients
$3,500,000
a
year
for
the
indefinite
future.
the
fee
here
awarded
was
$117,000.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
be
some
mathematical
relationship,
but
i
recall
judge
wilke
in
the
minority
in
copeland
saying
that
there
$30,000
had
been
achieved
and
wasn't
it
terrible
that
there
the
attorneys
were
going
to
get
a
fee
substantially
in
excess
of
the
$30,000
that
the
clients
had
realized.
that
consideration
is
not,
i
suggest,
in
this
case.
to
dispose
of
another
matter
which
justice
o'connor
alluded
to
in
her
question,
i
would
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
reading
a
short
paragraph
from
the
state's
brief
that
was
submitted
to
judge
sweet,
who
is
the
district
court
judge
who
set
the
fees.
the
state
says,
"the
starting
point
in
the
determination
of
a
fee
award
is
calculation
of
the
time
the
attorney
has
expended
on
the
case
multiplied
by
an
hourly
rate
which
is
determined
by
the
amount
to
which
attorneys
of
like
skill
in
the
area
would
typically
be
entitled
for
a
given
type
of
work
on
the
basis
of
an
hourly
rate
of
compensation.
"
"the
result
of
this
computation
is
the
lodestar
amount.
"
the
state
invited
judge
sweet
to
use
that
analysis.
mr.
leon
silverman
having
been
unsuccessful
at
least
before
judge
sweet
they
have
indeed
abandoned
it.
i
do
not
argue
that
that
rises
to
the
dignity
of
a
waiver,
but
it
surely,
i
think,
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
judge
sweet's
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
leon
silverman
the
court
of
appeals,
well,
entertained
it.
the
court
of
appeals
considered
and
rejected
it.
mr.
leon
silverman
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
leon
silverman
no,
they
did
not.
i
merely
make
mention
of
it
to
indicate
that
judge
sweet
in
exercising
his
discretion
did
not,
or
at
least
i
am
arguing
that
that
is
a
factor
that
goes
into
the
judge's
exercise
of
discretion,
but
let
me
go
further
and
say
that
the
state
waived
a
hearing
and
waived
cross
examination
on
the
number
of
hours
that
were
worked
in
this
case.
they
conceded
the
accuracy,
although
the
time
records
were
available
and
the
attorneys
who
worked
on
the
case
were
available
for
cross
examination
on
the
date
of
the
hearing.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
it
surely
would
not,
your
honor,
but
let
me
suggest
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
well
made
out
here
by
the
submission
of
affidavits,
the
digest
of
the
time
records,
and
the
submission
of
memoranda
which
called
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
society
felt
were
comparable
cases
submitted
on
the
other
side
were
the
citation
of
other
cases
which
the
state
thought
were
comparable.
a
prima
facie
case,
i
suggest,
was
made
out.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
my
friends
on
the
other
side
could
have
examined
to
their
hearts'
delight
with
respect
to
duplication,
excessive
hours,
they
do
not
challenge
that
the
number
of
hours
were
actually
worked.
now,
i
will
try
to
get
over
one
other...
what
i
think
is
a
major
point,
but
one
which
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
at
length.
the
factual
predicate
upon
which
this
court
is
now
being
asked
to
change
the
traditional
and,
i
submit,
congressionally
mandated
method
for
the
setting
of
fees
under
1988,
that
factual
predicate
is
absolutely
non-existent.
in
our
lodgement
with
the
court,
in
appendix
3,
we
have
tried
to
make
a
meticulous
analysis
of
the
cases
that
have
arisen
under
1988
which
appear
in
the
pocket
parts,
and
we
have
tried
fairly
to
chart
them
in
a
way
that
is
meaningful
for
the
court.
it
is
my
submission
that
that
demonstrates,
that
factual
determination
from
the
way
the
courts
have
applied
1988
shows
that
they
have
been
moderate
and
reasonable
in
amounts.
they
have
exercised
their
discretion
as
the
congress
intended
them
to,
and
they
have
done
so
reasonably
by
using
the
prevailing
rates
in
the
community
approach.
now,
it
is
right,
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
that
the
point
of
this
appeal
is
the
legislative
history,
and
i
have...
i
am
willing
to
confront
that
because
i
welcome
that
analysis.
this
court
has
recently
made
an
analysis
of
1988's
legislative
history.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
think
that
the
legislative
history
is
fairly
to
be
determined
when
the
congress
has
considered
and
rejected.
i
suggest--
mr.
leon
silverman
--your
honor,
i
think
that
i
have,
if
i--
mr.
leon
silverman
--i
may
live
to
regret
these
words,
but
i
think
i
have
the
easier
case
in
demonstrating
that
the
legislative
history
manifests
the
congress's
intention
that
fees
should
be
awarded
on
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
community
test.
it
never
considered
the
word
"cost"
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history,
that
is,
the
costs
of
the
rendition
of
services.
mr.
leon
silverman
no,
sir.
he
may
charge...
law
professors,
i
take
it
from
reading
the
press,
tend
to
be
rather
extravagant
in
their
notions
as
to
what
the
value
of
their
services
are.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
the
courts
have
yet
to
be
heard
from,
and
i
suggest
that
the
district
court
in
massachusetts
will
award
that
professor
an
amount
which
is
comparable
to
the
prevailing
rates
in
the
community
for
a
person
with
his
undoubted
talent,
stature,
years
at
the
bar,
and
whatever
other
criteria
the
court
uses
to
fix
the
touchstone
of
prevailing
rates
in
the
community.
mr.
leon
silverman
not
a
word,
your
honor.
i
find
this
to
be
such
an
interesting
construct
which
my
friend
passes
off
as
being
the
simplest
of
things
to
deal
with.
you
make
some
mathematical
computation
as
to
how
much
a
person
of
this
age
and
weight
in
a
legal
services
office
makes
at
the
private
bar,
and
then
you
take
all
the
overhead,
and
you
kind
of
divide
it,
and
that
is
a
simple
computation.
mr.
leon
silverman
well,
i...
there
are
an
infinite
number...
you
may
have
to
pay
the
wall
street
lawyers
different
sums
based
on
the
following.
it
may
be
that
firm
a
is
in
the
19th
year
of
a
20-year
lease
in
one
of
the
great
buildings,
and
that
may
be
productive
of
a
$10
rental.
i
don't
think
it
fair
to
say
that
you
can
rent
if
you
are
entering
into
a
negotiation
with
a
landlord
for
that
space
that
rental
of
$10.
you
may
be
looking
at
a
$50
rental.
if
this
court
or
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
courts
going
to
now
have
to
make
an
examination
into
what
the
costs
for
every
lawyer,
law
firm,
civil
rights
organization,
legal
aid
society,
or--
mr.
leon
silverman
--well,
your
honor,
the
answer
is,
i
don't
think
that
the
same...
that
the
lawyers...
given
the
same
case,
and
lawyer
a
and
lawyer
b
having
worked
side
by
side,
and
the
stipulations
which
your
honor
refers
to
are
entered
into,
i
should
think
that
they
would
both
get
the
same
amount.
if
there
were
a
different
ratio
for
each
of
them,
by
my
friend's
theory,
they
would
get
different
amounts.
the
stipulation
is
what
really--
mr.
leon
silverman
--i
have
yet
to
hear
of
such
stipulations.
i
would
find
it
really
rather
fanciful
that
when
law
firms
or
attorneys
are
seeking
fees,
that
they
are
going
to
stipulate
themselves
out
of
court.
they
may
agree
on
a
settlement
of
their
law
fee.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor...
forgive
me,
your
honor.
i
did
not
mean
to
interrupt.
of
course
the
answer
is
on
the
tip
of
their
tongue,
but
is
the
answer
accurate?
let
me
put
to
your
honor
some
very
serious
questions
that
law
firms,
and
i
don't
care
whether
it
is
a
professional
corporation
which...
in
which
the
notion
of
profits
is
rather
curious,
or
a
partnership
consisting
of
professional
corporations
and
partners,
or
a
major
partnership,
or
a
medium-sized
partnership
or
a
single
practitioner,
let
me
say
that
the
question
as
to
what
goes
into
costs,
if
you
want
to
be
glib
and
answer
a
question
that
someone
puts
to
you,
you
can
come
up
with
a
figure,
but
if
you
do
this
in
any
mathematically
precise
way,
let
me
put
some
questions
that
inevitably
are
going
to
come
to
the
district
courts
if
this
court
changes
the
way
they
are
to
approach
these
questions.
for
example,
how
do
you
treat
in
the
legal
aid
society
fundraising?
part
of
overhead
or
not?
how
do
you
treat
in
the
private
law
firm
business
development
expense?
some
firms
award
them
to
partners.
some
firms
make
partners
use
them
on
their
own.
i
could
sit,
your
honor,
and
in
a
day
develop
100
such
questions.
i
do
not
suggest
that
they
are
not
answerable.
they
are
answered
because
the
standards
for
cost
accounting
are
essentially
arbitrary.
mr.
leon
silverman
certainly,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
they
are
not
identical,
but
they
are
within
ranges.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
and
if
i
may
suggest
it,
your
honor,
the
way
the
courts
have
for...
i
don't
mean
to
be
irreverent...
for
donkeys'
years
dealt
with
this
problem.
this
court
is
not
confronted
for
the
first
time
with
how
you
fix
rates,
lawyers'
fees.
mr.
leon
silverman
the
courts
have
done
this
now
for
decades.
mr.
leon
silverman
somewhere
between
$65
and
$85
today.
mr.
leon
silverman
for
first
year
lawyers.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
first
year
associates.
i
have
answered
your
question.
mr.
leon
silverman
not...
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
you
meant
the
hourly
rate.
mr.
leon
silverman
forgive
me
if
i--
mr.
leon
silverman
--the
hourly
rate
is
between
$65
and
about
$80
to
$85
an
hour
for
a
person
out
of
law
school,
and
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
if
a
person
comes
to
a
law
firm
having
served
as
a
law
secretary
or
clerk
for
a
member
of
the
supreme
court,
he
is
not
a
first
year
associate,
he
comes
in
as
a
second
or
a
third
year
associate,
depending
upon
how
much
time
he
has
clerked
for
various
judges,
and
that
rate
is
commensurately
higher.
mr.
leon
silverman
for
the
major
firms,
there
tends
to
be
a
kind
of
standard.
mr.
leon
silverman
now,
that
standard
sometimes
gets
out
of
whack
because
raises
come
into
effect
on
january
1st
or
september
1st,
and
the
associates
are
not
terribly
bashful
about
pointing
out
to
the
law
firms
when
they
feel
that
the
law
firms
are
falling
behind--
0
[generallaughter.]
--and
law
firms
then
generally
respond
to
that,
but
if
your
honor
please,
the
problem
of
setting
fees
by
judges
is
something
that
has
been
known
for
decades.
it
is
my
friends
on
the
other
side
who
for
the
first
time
suggest
that
a
cost
analysis
come
up.
i
said--
mr.
leon
silverman
--your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
the
process
would
differ.
i
do
not
consider
it
more
difficult
to
use
the
prevailing
market
rate,
which
as
i
say
now
has
a
history
of
decades
behind
it
than
to
go
to
a
cost
accounting
system,
and
may
i
observe,
your
honor,
that
when
i
said
that
the
questions
that
one
would
have
to
answer
are
answerable,
they
are
dogmatically
answerable.
there
is
no
particular
logical
morality
in
cost
accounting
concepts,
but
it
took
an
accounting
standards
board
ten
years
to
come
up
with
this
volume,
which
is
cost
accounting
standards
in
connection
with
government
contracts.
my
friends--
mr.
leon
silverman
--the
running
of
a
law
firm,
your
honor,
since
i
am
doing
it
for
mine,
i
know
of
nothing
more
complicated.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
in
terms
of
accounting
standards,
since
no
law
firm
that
i
know
of
begins
to
keep
its
records
on
any
basis
which
would
permit
this
kind
of
a
computation,
someone,
mr.
chief
justice,
must
determine
the
yea
or
the
nay
of
a
particular
cost
item.
now,
if
each
district
court
is
going
to
do
it
for
itself,
i
suggest
the
circuit
courts
are
going
to
be
very
heavily
involved,
and
i
suggest
that
eventually
this
court
may
sit
and
determine
whether
or
not
professional
development
expenses,
recruitment
expenses,
what
all
are
an
item
of
cost.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
it
is
a--
mr.
leon
silverman
--i
don't
want
to
be
seen
to
be
adopting
words
the
implications
of
which
i
am
not
comfortable
with.
the
word
"profit"
is--
mr.
leon
silverman
--it's
a
funny
thing
in
a
law
firm.
mr.
leon
silverman
more
than
you
pay
the
young
man
for
his
salary.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
suggest--
mr.
leon
silverman
--your
honor,
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
most
complicated
problem.
mr.
leon
silverman
but
you...
forgive
me.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
i
heard,
i
read
judge
friendly
say
that's
not
complicated.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
the
material
in
our
brief
which
indicates
that
it
is
very
simplistic
to
take
all
of
your
costs
and
spread
them
over
the
number
of
timekeepers,
if
you
will,
but
are
all
of
those
costs
legitimately
part
of
costs?
for
example,
the
cost
analysis
my
friend
argues
for,
he
can't
mean
and
the
state
can't
mean
that
whatever
your
costs
are
you
may
pass
them
along.
somebody
is
going
to
some
day
say,
hey,
that
is
not
right.
you
can't
have
premises
in
which
you
are
going
to
have
an
art
collection
in
which
you
are...
and
that
is
part
of
cost...
in
which
you
are
going
to
pass
on
to
the
taxpayers
of
the
state.
what
are
you
going
to
judge
these
unbridled
costs
against?
and
that
word
will
be
soon
used.
you
would
have
to
do
it
against
prevailing
market
rates.
whatever
system
you
have--
mr.
leon
silverman
--the
costs?
mr.
leon
silverman
my
friends
raised
it
in
argument.
it
was
responded
to,
and
it
made
little--
mr.
leon
silverman
--in
their
briefs.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
i
didn't--
mr.
leon
silverman
--because
it
is...
if
i
may
suggest
it,
it
is
bizarre,
and
i
don't
really
know
why
we
are
here.
i
can
understand
that
a...
looking
at
the
fees
in
this
case,
someone
must
have
said,
oh,
my
lord,
that
really
is
rather
high,
and
when
my
friends
on
the
state
side
put
their
briefs
in
and
indicated
that
this
was
well
on
the
verge
of
bankrupting
the
various
communities
around
the
country,
that
is
utter
rubbish.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
i
believe
that
had
the
justices
of
this
court
seen
our
appendix
3,
and
been
persuaded
as
i
urge
that
you
be
persuaded,
that
this
does
not
manifest
some
hog
wild
approach
to
the
public
fisc.
let
me
point
out
to
your
honor
39
of
the
attorneys
general
who
are
amici
agree
with
the
reasonable
fees
in
the
community.
it
is
only
new
york
state
and
massachusetts
among
the
states
that
are
complaining
about
that.
the
39
states
do
not
find
it
difficult.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
privy
to
why
this
court
granted
cert.--
mr.
leon
silverman
--i
beg...
the
bonus?
the
upward
adjustment?
i
will
direct
myself
to
that
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
leon
silverman
it
surely
is.
but
let
me
first--
mr.
leon
silverman
--your
honor,
i
do
not
consider
that
there
is
disagreement
with
respect
to
the
upward
adjustment
of
the
lodestar.
if
you
adopt
what
i
think
is
the
reasonable
congressionally
mandated,
judicially
sanctioned,
universally
around
the
country
theory
that,
a,
private
law
firms
and
public
interest
law
firms
must
be
treated
alike,
that
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
the
prevailing
rates
in
the
community
ought
to
determine
the
initial
step
in
the
lodestar,
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
adopt...
that
sounds
much
more
presumptuous
than
i
mean
for
it
to
be.
it
is
right
to
then
say
what
is
the
permissible
bounds
or
what
are
the
criteria
for
determining
an
upward
adjustment
in
the
lodestar?
this
court,
and
i
believe
unanimously,
in
the
hensley
case
said
that
the
first
step
is
to
determine
the
lodestar,
albeit
not
using
that
word,
but
going
through
that
process,
and
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
powell
for
the
entire
court
said
that's
only
the
first
step.
then
you
determine
whether
there
should
be
an
upward
adjustment
or
a
downward
adjustment
depending
upon
the
exceptional
nature
of
the
factors
in
the
particular
case
involved.
mr.
leon
silverman
oh,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
depends
only
upon
winning
the
lawsuit,
but
in
this
case
the
judge
held,
having
looked
at
comparable
cases
around
the
country,
that
an
upward
enhancement
was
justified,
as
i
believe
has
been
held
by
all
of
the
courts
around
the
country.
you
see,
if
you
use
the
word
"bonus",
you
are
using
a
nasty
word,
because
bonus
is
sometimes
defined
as
something
in
addition
to
a
reasonable
fee.
but
i
prefer,
as
the
courts
have
done,
to
use
the
word
"upward
adjustment"
as
a
part
of
the
reasonable
fee,
and
if
it
becomes
part
of
the
reasonable
fee,
an
upward
adjustment
is
not,
if
i
may
say
so,
unreasonable.
mr.
leon
silverman
precisely,
your
honor,
and
that
has
been
determined
again
in
the
legislative
history
to
be
permissible
as
not,
and
i
repeat,
not
producing
a
windfall.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
contingency
means
various
things
to
various
people.
contingency
as
i
understand
it,
that
means
an
upward
enhancement
with
respect
to
the
risk
factor,
is
whether
or
not
the
lawyer
will
be
successful
in
that
case.
it
isn't
whether
he
is
going
to
be
paid
for
cases
that
he
has
lost.
here,
the
legal
aid
society,
and
let
me
put
it
down
to
cases,
the
legal
aid
society
has
a
1988
case.
it
is
a
responsible
organization.
i
assure
this
court
that
as
a
director
of
that
organization,
we
do
not
run
off
filing
cases
willy-nilly.
it
is
a
mature
and
reflective
process.
we
determined
that
this
should
be
brought
as
a
class
action,
and
we
determined
to
put
a
team
together
so
that
the
case
could
be
litigated,
we
think,
expeditiously
and
successfully.
mr.
leon
silverman
not
on
the
basis
that
you
are
going
to
pay
him
for
unsuccessful
cases.
mr.
leon
silverman
but
let
me
say
what
i
do
think
the
contingency
in
this
case
is,
about
which
i
have
no
doubt
there
may
be
some
disagreement.
a
private
practitioner,
i
don't
care
whether
it's
a
law
firm
or
whatever,
makes
a
judgment
that
he
is
going
to
take
a
1988
case,
and
he
has
a
chance
of
losing
it,
in
which
case
his
time
will
be
unpaid
for,
or
that
he
will
win
it,
in
which
case
he
will
get
some
additional
sum
by
reason
of
that
risk
factor.
not
other
cases.
the
legal
aid
society
does
if
not
the
same
thing,
not
substantially
different.
mr.
leon
silverman
no,
sir,
because
that
additional
sum
would
be
computed
in
the
fair
hourly
rate.
mr.
leon
silverman
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
was
trying
to
get
a
two-step
analysis,
and
i
am
trying
to
adopt
the
analysis
that
mr.
justice
powell
went
through
and
all
of
the
other
cases
that
talk
about
the
lodestar,
and
then
a
further
consideration
before
a
reasonable
fee
is
determined.
mr.
leon
silverman
yes,
he
takes
a
risk
in
that
lawsuit.
mr.
leon
silverman
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
of
course,
but
most
people
who
have
fee
paying
clients
don't
take
a
risk
that
they
are
not
going
to
get
paid.
mr.
leon
silverman
your
honor,
i
may
be
making
more
of
this
than
need
be
made.
i
merely
want
to
get
away
from
the
notion
that
when
you
take
case
a
you
get
an
additional
amount
because
you
have
lost
case
b.
that
i
do
not
consider
to
be,
surely
in
light
of
this
court's
instructions,
a
reasonable
way
to
define
contingency.
however,
when
you
take
case
a
and
you
are
running
the...
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
silverman
if
you
are
running
the
risk
that
you
are
not
going
to
get
paid
as
a
private
lawyer,
the
legal
aid
society
runs
the
rick
that
it
will
not
be
able
to
render
services.
that
risk
is
the
same,
and
i
suggest
has
a
much
higher
public
purpose
than
merely
putting
money
into
a
private
practitioner's
pocket.
this
means
that
our
clients
cannot
get
paid.
that
risk
is
what
is
compensated
for
in
the
risk
adjustment,
but
i
must
add,
that
risk
adjustment
was
not
used
by
judge
sweet
for
fixing
the
upward
adjustment
here.
he
chose
not
to
use
that
as
a
factor.
therefore
that
discussion
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
i
consider
to
be
rather
academic.
mr.
leon
silverman
sir?
mr.
leon
silverman
fascinating,
your
honor.
