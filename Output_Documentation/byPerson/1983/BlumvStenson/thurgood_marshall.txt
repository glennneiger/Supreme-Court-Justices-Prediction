justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
the
going
rate
for
civil
liberties
lawyers
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
going
to
measure
it
by?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
sure
wish
that
was
retroactive.
go
ahead.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
leventhal,
if
i
could
back
up
a
minute,
we've
got
two
defendants.
one
is
defended
by
legal
aid,
and
the
other
is
defended
pro
bono
by
a
wall
street
firm,
and
they
both
try
the
case.
one
will
get
more
money
than
the
other?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
no
more
work
than
the
other
one
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
had
no
more
education,
and
no
more
brains.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
word
windfall,
up
until...
he
didn't
get
anything,
so
any
of
it
is
a
windfall.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
before
the
statute
there
was
none.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
now
they
get
it.
somebody
could
call
that
a
windfall.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
some
wall
street
firms
back
in
the
good
old
days
had
as
many
as
13
and
15
pro
bono
cases,
and
didn't
get
a
single
nickel
out
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
illustrate
what
they
are
now
getting?
all
of
it
is
a
windfall?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
before,
they
didn't
say
pay
me
whatever
you
want
because
they
couldn't
get
paid.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--does
the
history
say
anything
about
this
overhead
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
pay
a
wall
street
lawyer
with
an
office
in
wall
street
more
than
you
pay
a
lawyer
with
offices
on
madison
avenue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
law
firm
would
you
compare
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
law
firm
with
no
overhead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
any
in
mind,
though,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
this
late...
how
long
has
this
case
been
pending?
