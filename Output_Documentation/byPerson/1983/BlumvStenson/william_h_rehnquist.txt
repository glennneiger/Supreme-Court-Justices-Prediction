justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leventhal,
that
is
true
of
any
fee
shifting
statute,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
section
1988
isn't
the
first
statute
that
has
ever
been
passed
by
a
legislature
saying
that
the
losing
party
pays
the
winning
party's
attorney's
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
leventhal,
i
am
confused.
were
the
time
records
themselves
filed
with
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
such
records
were
filed
by
the
plaintiffs
in
support
of
their
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leventhal,
in
a
couple
of
your
responses
to
questions
from
the
bench,
you
have
said
that
you
thought
the
private
firm
was
entitled
to
make
a
profit.
now,
one
could
draw
from
that
the
inference
that
they
were
going
to
pay
dividends
to
its
stockholders
from
some
of
that.
do
you
mean
anything
more
than
it
was
entitled
to
get
its
overhead?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
silverman,
suppose...
is
your
only
objecting
to
the
figuring
in
of
the
overhead
factor
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
statistics?
supposing
a
court
were
presented
with
a
stipulation
that
lawyer
a's...
that
the
standard
rate
in
the
area
was
$100
an
hour,
and
that
the
standard
percentage
of
net
to
gross,
or
say
the
standard
ratio
of
overhead
was
40
percent
of
gross,
and
then
you
also
had
in
the
stipulation
that
the
particular
lawyer
seeking
a
fee
had
a
ratio
of
overhead
to
gross
of
15
percent.
now,
if
all
that
were
stipulated,
would
you
say
that
lawyer
b
was
entitled
to
the
same
hourly
rate
to
be
awarded
as
lawyer
a?
