unknown
speaker
that
was
the
substance
of
their
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
evidence
put
in
with
respect
to
how
many
hours
a
year
a
lawyer
of
this
status
and
stature
would
have?
in
other
words,
can
it
be
assumed
that
about
2,000
hours
a
year
is
the
amount
of
time
a
two-year
lawyer
can
put
in?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
lawyer
who
has
the
obligations
of
running
the
firm,
besides
taking
care
of
the
clients.
unknown
speaker
there
are
studies
extant,
the
american
bar
and
others,
that
lawyers
at
the
lower
echelons
in
the
law
firm
can
put
in
2,000
charged
hours
a
year.
unknown
speaker
that
would
mean
at
the
rate
they
were
allowed
here
these
men
would
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
what?
over
$400,000
a
year,
wouldn't
it?
is
it
$150
plus
the
$75?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
it
isn't
$150
and
then
$75?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
spell
that
out
any
more,
mr.
leventhal?
how
does
one
go
about
deciding
what
a
market
rate
is
for
a
particular
attorney?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
claim,
i
take
it,
that
there
is
such
an
overhead
with
respect
to
the
society
here.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
going
rate,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
cost
figures
would
be
any
more
easy
to
calculate
or
to
ascertain
actually?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
windfall
in
the
sense
that
the
non-profit
organization
in
effect
is
being
paid
more
than
the
commercial
organization.
unknown
speaker
just
because...
they
just
net
more.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
get
one
thought
that
justice
white's
question
prompted
in
my
mind.
do
you
contend
that
the
rate
would
be
different
if
these
were
lawyers
working
for
a
large
new
york
wall
street
firm
and
were
allowed
to
work
on
this
case
on
their
own?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
apply
a
different
standard
to
a
private
practitioner
than
to
one
working
for
a
public
interest
organization?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
to
take
the
converse
for
a
moment,
because
there
is
some
discussion
about
the
problem
the
states
have
when
they
hire
private
counsel
in
antitrust
cases
and
things
like
that,
i
take
it
the
standard
there
would
be
the
comparable
market
standard
rather
than
the
non-profit
standard,
because
you
want
to
be
able
to
compete
in
the
market
for
good
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
contingency
factor
enter
into
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
leventhal,
even
if
your
economics
are
unimpeachable,
the
real
question
is
a
statutory
construction
question
in
this
case,
and
if
it
were
just
true
and
obvious
that
congress
had
mandated
a
so-called
market
measure,
you
would
be
out
of
court,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
going
to
get
to
what
congress
intended?
unknown
speaker
or
other
associates.
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
tradition
of
partners
living
off
associates?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
not
a
fact
of
life
recognized
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
that
partners
in
big
law
firms
make
part
of
their
profit
by
the
work
of
the
associates?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
they
have
abandoned
that
notion
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
entertained
that,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
so
it
was
there.
unknown
speaker
and
they
accepted
it.
they
didn't
say,
awfully
sorry,
but
you
didn't
present
it
below.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
certain
element
there
of
on
whom
is
the
burden
of
proof,
isn't
there,
mr.
silverman?
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
is
obligated
to
justify
by
a
certain
prima
facie
case
the
attorneys'
fees
which
it
has...
rather,
if
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
justify
it,
if
they
are
obligated
to
come
forth
with
a
prima
facie
case,
if
they
didn't,
the
fact
that
the
defendants
might
have
utterly
devastated
their
showing
even
further
by
cross
examination
or
by
discovery
doesn't
make
up
for
the
lack
of
a
prima
facie
case
on
the
part
of
the
party
who
has
to
show
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
silverman,
unless
you
had
really
some
support
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
foreclose
the
kind
of
an
approach
that
is
suggested
by
your
colleague
on
the
other
side,
you
might
be
in
trouble.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
all
i
am
saying,
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
you
are
at
least
helped
considerably
if
you
have
some
congressional
support.
that
is
a
different
case
than
if
congress
had
said
to
the
courts,
award
these
fees
on
any
basis
you
think
is
just.
then
you
would
have
a
tougher
case,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
you--
unknown
speaker
--by
that
you
would
mean
that
a
law
professor
who
takes
a
particular
case
just
on
appeal,
for
example,
where
it
is
easier
to
measure
the
time,
has
no
significant
overhead,
can
charge
the
same
as
sullivan
and
cromwell
or
your
firm
or--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
justice
rehnquist's
example,
who
would
get
hurt?
would
the...
the
only
way
you
can
keep
anyone
from
getting
hurt
is
to
pay
the
one
with
the
15
percent
overhead
the
same
as
the
other
fellow.
i
suppose
he
might
get
hurt
if
he
was
foolish
enough
to
sign
the
stipulation.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
of
course,
most
of
the
firms...
i
have
asked
a
good
many
firms,
what
does
it
cost
you
a
year
for
your
first
year
associate,
and
they
have
an
answer
right
on
the
tip
of
their
tongue--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
silverman--
--may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
what
you
are
saying.
your
basic
position
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
prevailing
rate
in
the
community
is
a
lodestone,
but
is
the
prevailing
rate
with
respect
to
the
employment
of
associate
lawyers
identical
in
new
york
city?
of
course
it
is
not.
it
is
very
different
in
my
city
of
richmond,
i
can
tell
you
that.
unknown
speaker
oh,
within
range?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
prevailing
rate--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
prevailing
rate
for
the
wall
street
law
firms
for
first
year
associates?
unknown
speaker
first
year?
unknown
speaker
without
clerking
any--
unknown
speaker
--first
year
associates.
unknown
speaker
you
said
$65,000
to
$80,000?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the...
i
thought
you
said
thousands.
what
is
the
hourly
rate?
unknown
speaker
are
associate
lawyers
paid
the
same
in
the
various
new
york
law
offices?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
silverman,
don't
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
great
difference
in
the
problem
of
fixing
fees
now
and
let
us
say
50
years
ago
or
40
years
ago
in
cases
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
running
a
law
firm,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest
a
hypothetical
that
might
not
be
so
complicated
that
it
would
need
a
cpa
and
a
ten-year
study
to
resolve.
an
associate
is
paid
his
rate,
his
salary
is
fixed
at
$25
an
hour,
and
he
is
getting
$50,000
more
or
less
a
year,
somewhere
around
that,
because
this
1,400
hours
is
not
the
standard
for
associates
as
it
is
for
partners
now.
now,
he
is
getting
$25
an
hour--
--partners
are
more,
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
--and
he
is
charging...
and
the
firm
is
charging
$50.
now,
that
is
a
profit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
profit.
i
am
not
suggesting
anything
is
wrong
with
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
call
it--
unknown
speaker
--let's
call
it
markup
then.
at
any
rate,
here
is
a
margin.
unknown
speaker
now,
some
of
that
is
because
the
firm
is
taking
a
certain
measure
of
responsibility.
that's
a
factor
that's
an
intangible
one,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
they
can
readily
calculate
what
is
the
overhead
factor
to
be
assigned
to
that
associate.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
need
a
cpa
for
that
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
having
done
it
myself,
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
it
is
not
all
that
complicated.
unknown
speaker
--in
oral
argument,
or
was
it
in
their
briefs?
unknown
speaker
because
it's...
they
have
a
very
conscientious
panel
and
didn't
even
mention
the
issue,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
here
presumably
because
at
least
four
justices
of
this
court
voted
to
grant
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
silverman,
there
may
be
another
reason
for
granting
cert,
because
there
is
another
issue
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
50
percent?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
that
is
an
issue,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
some...
there
is
disagreement
around
the
country
on
that,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
just
didn't
depend
on
winning
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
it
is
part
of
the
prevailing
rates
in
the
community.
unknown
speaker
and
the
contingency
is
part
of
that
factor,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
suggesting
then
that
it
would
be
proper
to
make
an
award
based
on
what
a
contingency,
a
regular
contingency
fee
lawyer
might
charge?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
mr.
silverman,
you
said
the
private
practitioner
if
he
wins
will
get
some
additional
sum.
do
you
mean
some
additional
sum
over
and
above
the
fair
hourly
rate?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
why
did
you
use
the
word
"additional"?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
insist
that
he
is
entitled
to
an
extra
fee
because
he
took
a
risk?
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody
does.
what
risk
did
he
take?
unknown
speaker
everybody
takes
a
risk
when
he
is
in
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
then
you
really
are
compensating
for
the
contingency
like
a
personal
injury
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
but
interesting.
unknown
speaker
but
interesting.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
the
city
had
won
its
case...
is
it
the
city
or
the
state?
unknown
speaker
the
state.
if
the
state
had
won
its
case
and
the
judge
had
thought
the
suit
was
wholly
frivolous,
i
suppose
the
state
could
have
collected
some
attorneys'
fees.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
like
to
cost
justify
that?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
on
your
theory
you
would
have
to
cost
justify.
unknown
speaker
you
tell
us
how
to
figure
it,
i
know,
by
this
cost
accounting.
unknown
speaker
under
your
approach
have
you
figured
what
this
fee
should
have
been?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
leventhal,
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
could
fail
under
your
approach
to
insisting
on
cost
accounting
for
fees
when
no
non-profit
organization
is
involved,
but
just
private
lawyers,
individual
lawyers
or
individual
lawyers
attached
to
law
firms,
because
i
would
think,
as
you
say,
there
are
just
hundreds
of
law
firms,
two-man,
three-man.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
have
to
do
that
with
every
fee
award
to
a
private
organization?
you
would
have
to
figure
that
lawyer's
costs.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
then?
you
would
just
go
to
the
prevailing
market
rate?
unknown
speaker
would
you
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do?
unknown
speaker
not
cost,
not
prevailing
market.
what
would
you
do?
unknown
speaker
estimate
on
what
basis?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
do
a
cost
accounting
based
on
each
individual
law
firm.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
you
would
do
an
estimate
on
each,
and
your
estimate
might
be
one
thing
for
one
law
firm
and
another
for
another.
unknown
speaker
low.
unknown
speaker
you
could
find
one.
unknown
speaker
and
you
haven't
come
up
with
one
yet?
