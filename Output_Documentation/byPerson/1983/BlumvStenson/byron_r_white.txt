it
is
unquestioned

let's
just
add
a
third
to
justice
marshall's
example.
there
are
three
firms
representing
three
different...
three
lawyers
representing
three
different
defendants
in
the
same
case.
two
of
them
are
from
private
firms.
one
of
them
is
from
a
non-profit
firm.
but
the
overhead
in
one
of
the
private
firms
is
considerably
different
than
the
other.

we
have
to
go
into
the
cost
feature
on
every
private
firm,

--then
what
do
you
do?
just
the
market?

i
know,
but
you
have
different
cases
represented
by
different
kinds
of
lawyers
who
are
privately
employed.

you
don't
suggest
to
me
that
the
fees
of
all
the
firms,
the
smallest
to
the
largest,
are
the
same?

even
though
each
one
of
them
is
justified
cost-wise.
