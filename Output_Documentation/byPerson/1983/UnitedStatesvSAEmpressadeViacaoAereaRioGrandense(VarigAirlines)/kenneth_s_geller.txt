mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
aviation
administration
has
been
charged
by
congress
with
the
responsibility
of
promoting
safety
of
flight
of
civil
aircraft.
the
agency
fulfills
its
statutory
mandate
in
two
principal
ways,
one
of
which
is
essentially
legislative,
the
other
of
which
can
be
described
as
law
enforcement.
first,
the
faa
promulgates
regulations
prescribing
minimum
safety
standards
governing
the
design,
material,
construction
and
performance
of
civil
aircraft.
these
standards
take
up
more
than
500
pages
in
title
vix
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
second,
the
faa
tries
to
police
the
aircraft
industry's
compliance
with
these
safety
standards
by
reviewing
design
and
performance
data,
conducting
tests
and
deciding
whether
to
certify
that
particular
aircraft
are
in
conformity
with
its
regulations.
congress
has
made
it
unlawful
to
operate
an
airplane
that
does
not
have
a
current
airworthiness
certificate
issued
by
the
faa.
these
cases
were
brought
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
on
behalf
of
the
owners
and
passengers
of
two
airplanes
that
crashed
due
to
in-flight
fires.
respondents
sought
more
than
$100
million
in
damages
from
the
united
states
on
the
ground
that
the
faa
was
negligent
in
carrying
cut
its
statutory
responsibilities
by
certifying
the
airplanes
that
crashed
even
though
they
allegedly
did
not
comply
with
the
agency's
safety
standards.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
respondents'
arguments.
we
have
sought
certiorari
because
we
believe
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
to
expose
the
united
states
to
tort
liability
to
members
of
the
general
public
for
errors
in
carrying
out
its
regulatory
responsibilities.
although
the
issues
here
are
solely
ones
of
law,
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
begin
by
briefly
describing
the
facts
of
these
cases
in
order
to
show
just
how
far
reaching
and
unprecedented
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
in
this
case
really
is.
the
united
scottish
insurance
case
involves
an
airplane
that
was
manufactured
in
the
united
kingdom
in
1951.
it
was
sold
to
an
air
taxi
service
known
as
air
wisconsin.
in
1965
air
wisconsin
contracted
with
aerodyne
engineering
corporation
for
the
installation
of
a
gasoline
fuel
heater,
and
as
required
by
faa
regulations
aerodyne
applied
for
what
is
called
a
supplemental
type
certificate
authorizing
the
installation
of
the
heater.
in
1966,
the
following
year,
the
airplane
was
sold
by
air
wisconsin
to
respondent
dowdle
who
owned
catalina-vegas
airlines,
another
air
taxi
service.
between
1966
and
the
crash
of
that
plane
in
1968
catalina-vegas
inspected
its
airplane
on
at
least
eight
occasions
including
two
major
yearly
inspections
of
the
gasoline
heater.
the
district
court
found
that
the
crash
occurred
because
the
gasoline
line
leading
to
the
heater
was
not
adequately
clamped
to
reduce
vibration
allegedly
in
violation
of
the
faa
safety
standard
prohibiting
"excessive
vibration
in
fuel
lines".
the
court
held
that
the
faa
was
negligent
in
inspecting
the
airplane
and
in
issuing
a
supplemental
type
certificate.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgement,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
agreeing
with
the
district
court
that
the
faa
was
liable
under
california's
law
as
a
good
samaritan.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
government
had
performed
a
service
for
the
respondents
within
the
meaning
of
the
good
samaratin
doctrine
and
that
the
government
should
expect
that
members
of
the
general
public
would
rely
on
its
certifications
of
airworthiness.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
inspection
would
have
taken
place
in
1965.
the
accident
took
place
in
1968.
the
facts
of
the
varig
case
involve
conduct
by
the
faa,
mr.
chief
justice,
even
more
remote
than
the
three
years
that
was
involved
in
united
scottish.
the
varig
concerns
the
crash
of
a
boeing
707
on
a
flight
from
rio
de
janeiro
to
paris
in
1973.
the
faa
had
issued
a
type
certificate
for
the
boeing
707
in
1958,
15
years
prior
to
the
crash.
the
plane
involved
in
that
case
had
been
sold
by
boeing
to
seaboard
airlines.
in
1969
seaboard
airlines
resold
the
plane
to
varig,
which
is
the
brazilian
air
carrier.
the
brazilian
took
the
plane
out
of
the
united
states
permanently
at
the
point,
which
had
the
result
of
voiding
its
faa
airworthiness
certificate.
respondent
alleged
that
the
crash
in
that
case
occurred
because
the
towel
disposal
area
in
one
of
the
aft
lavatories
on
the
boeing
707
was
not
designed
to
contain
fires,
allegedly
in
violation
of
the
faa
regulations,
and
that
the
faa
was
negligent
in
1958,
15
years
earlier,
in
not
noticing
this
defect
and
in
issuing
a
certificate
for
the
airplane.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
type
certificate.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
although
the
complaint
in
that
case
was
not
too
clear
as
to
exactly
which
certificate
they
were
complaining
about.
now
we
understand
from
the
briefs
that
respondents
in
the
varig
case
were
complaining
about
the
issuances
of
a
type
certificate,
which
was
the
first
certificate.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
airworthiness
certificate
is
the
final
certificate
that
is
issued
to
each
plane
as
it
comes
off
the
assembly
line,
and
the
faa
does
not
inspect
each
plane.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
the
faa,
for
example,
would
revoke
a
type
certificate
it
would
have
the
result
of
voiding
the
airworthiness
certificate.
you
have
to
have
a
valid
type
certificate
in
effect
to
have
a
valid
airworthiness
certificate.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
with
respect
to
each
airplane?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
faa
does
no
further
inspections
of
individual
airplanes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
has
general
responsibilities
to
make
certain
that
the
manufacturer
is
carrying
out
a
program
of
maintenance,
and
it
has,
i
am
told,
regular
inspections
of
air
carriers
to
make
sure
that
they
are
in
general
complying
with
maintenance
requirements.
but
it
no
longer
looks
at
any
particular
airplane.
that
is
the
responsibility
of
the
air
carrier.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no
further
certifications
of
individual
airplanes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
check
the
maintenance
of
air
carriers
in
general...
that
is
correct...
but
not
any
specific
airplane.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
plainly
incorrect
for
four
reasons,
any
one
of
which
would
require
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
first,
congress
did
not
intend
to
subject
the
united
states
to
damages
liability
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
actions
arising
out
of
government
regulatory
activities,
that
is,
for
negligence
in
enforcing
the
law
in
requiring
that
third
parties
comply
with
the
law.
moreover,
respondents'
claims
are
barred
by
the
misrepresentation
and
discretionary
function
exemptions
of
the
tort
claims
act.
finally,
the
faa's
regulatory
activities
even
if
they
are
to
be
judged
against
the
standards
of
state
tort
law
do
not
violate
the
good
samaritan
doctrine.
we
think
the
most
serious
error
of
the
court
of
appeals,
certainly
the
one
with
the
most
damaging
ramifications
is
its
unprecedented
holding
that
congress
intended
to
allow
the
courts
to
oversee
government
regulatory
or
law
enforcement
activities
in
the
guise
of
adjudicating
federal
tort
claims
act
suits.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
so,
justice
rehnquist.
i
hope
to
discuss
this,
but
there
is,
i
think,
a
basic
distinction
between
the
sorts
of
operational
activities
that
were
involved
in
those
cases
and
the
regulatory
activities
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
i
do
hope
to
expand
on
that
in
just
a
moment.
it
seems
clear
to
us
from
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
the
act
was
a
sort
of
ordinary,
common
law,
garden
variety
tort
such
as
automobile
accidents,
malpractice.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
just
as
clear
to
us
that
congress
did
not
want
the
act
to
be
used
as
a
way
of
challenging
so-called
governmental
functions.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
evidence
of
congress'
concern
that
actions,
for
example,
of
the
ftc
or
the
sec
not
be
the
subject
of
a
challenge
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
congress
not
only
put
in
the
disrectionary
function
exemption
to
take
care
of
this
problem
but
also
emphasized
the
point
by
putting
into
the
act
twice,
not
once
but
twice,
the
express
requirement
that
the
united
states
can
only
be
held
liable
in
circumstances
where
a
"private
person
under
state
law
would
be
liable.
"
this
phrase
appears
not
only
in
28
u.s.c.
2674,
which
is
the
substantive
liability
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
the
precise
same
phrase
appears
in
28
u.s.c.
1346(b),
which
is
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
district
courts
to
hear
tort
claims
act
cases.
this
court
recognized
the
same
basic
point
in
the
feres
case,
which
is
one
of
the
first
decisions
of
this
court
interpreting
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
there
the
court
held
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
allow
the
government
to
be
held
liable
for
engaging
in
activities
that
are
not
even
remotely
analogous
to
activities
that
private
parties
undertake.
the
actions
of
a
government
agency
in
enforcing
safety
legislation
pursuant
to
a
program
of
inspection
and
certification
simply
have
no
counterpart
in
the
private
sector.
these
sorts
of
regulatory
activities
are
a
form
of
law
enforcement.
the
faa,
for
example,
has
to
make
sure
that
private
parties
are
in
compliance
with
the
faa
statute
and
safety
regulations--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--prison
guard
or
the
united
states?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
assume
a
prison
guard
can
be
sued.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
under
the
muniz
case
the
united
states
can
be
sued
for
negligence
by
a
federal
prisoner,
yes,
for
the
sorts
of
torts
that
were
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
muniz
is
a
slightly
different
case
because
the
court
did
an
extensive
study
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
in
muniz
and
determined
that
unquestionably
congress
had
intended
to
cover
suits
by
state
prisoners.
on
the
other
hand,
even
in
muniz
in
light
of
what
i
said
to
justice
rehnquist
earlier,
even
in
minuz
just
like
in
indian
towing
and
in
rayonier
the
federal
government
was
itself
carrying
out
some
direct
service
performing
some
operational
function.
it
is
not
regulating
the
conduct
of
third
parties
to
make
sure
that
they
were
in
compliance--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--negligent
operation
of
a
military
aircraft?
if
the
united
states
itself
is
doing
some
operations,
performing
some
operations
itself--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--under
feres,
of
course,
the
united
states
could
not
be
sued
by
any
solider,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--a
suit
by
civilians
would
be
appropriate
because
the
united
states
is
itself--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
court
has
said
in
these
operational
cases
that
private
persons
do
not
have
to
be
engaged
in
the
identical
activities.
it
is
sufficient
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
they
engage
in
similar
sorts
of
activities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
point
that
the
court
made
in
indian
towing
and
in
rayonier,
but
private
people
do
not
regulate
the
affairs
of
other
private
people
for
the
purpose--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
justice,
but
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
ninth
circuit
said.
i
think
one
of
the
most
damaging
statements
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
pervades
the
rest
of
the
opinion
in
terms
of
its
error
was
the
statement
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
that
the
faa
has
a
responsibility
like
private
inspectors
to
inspect
every
portion
of
every
aircraft.
that
is
plainly
incorrect.
there
is
nothing
in
the
faa
statute,
or
manuals
or
regulations
that
imposes
that
responsibility
on
the
faa.
quite
the
contrary,
the
faa
has
always
had
the
responsibility
to
do
nothing
more
than
spot
check
or
to
do
as
extensive
an
investigation
of
any
aircraft
as
it
determines
is
necessary
to
make
certain
that
the
private
parties
who
have
the
operational
responsibilities
are
complying
with
the
faa
safety
standards.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
there
is
something
in
those
opinions
that
support
precisely
what
i
am
saying
here.
for
example,
in
indian
towing
350
u.s.
at
page
64
the
court
begins
its
opinion
by
saying,
"the
question
here
is
one
of
liability
for
negligence
at
what
this
court
has
characterized
the
operational
level
of
government
activity.
"
four
pages
later
on
page
68,
the
court
repeats,
"it
is
hard
to
think
of
any
government
activity
on
the
operational
level
or
present
concern
which
is
uniquely
governmental
in
the
sense
that
it
has
not
at
one
time
or
another
been
privately
performed.
"
so
the
court's
opinions
in
those
cases
do
suggest
that
what
the
court
had
in
mind
were
operational
rather
than
regulatory
activities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
those
cases,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
a
different
argument
was
made
and
rejected.
in
terms
of...
those
cases
involve
operational
activities.
the
government
had
suggested
that
in
the
universe
of
operational
activities
there
should
be
a
distinction
made
between
governmental
proprietary
activities
and
uniquely
governmental
activities.
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
is
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
operational
activities
everything
that
the
government
does
is
governmental,
and
it
is
foolish
to
distinguish
between
proprietary
activities
and
uniquely
governmental
activities.
this
case
involves
a
distinctly
different
sort
of
governmental
activity
which
is
a
regulatory
activity.
private
people
do
not
engage
in
regulatory
activities.
they
do
not
impose
sanctions
on
other
private
people.
they
do
not
issue
certificates
to
allow
other
private
people
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
all
of
these
distinctions
are
reconcilable,
justice
rehnquist,
because
i
do
think
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
operational
activities,
which
were
what
was
involved
and
what
the
court
emphasized
was
involved
in
indian
towing
and
in
rayonier,
and
regulatory
activities
in
terms
of
the
private
person
language
that
congress
twice
put
into
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
only
as
to
the
parts
of
dalehite
that
concern
operational
activities,
the
fighting
of
a
fire.
in
fact,
speaking
of
dalehite
i
think
the
precise
distinction
that
i
am
trying
to
make
here
was
emphasized
by
justice
jackson's
opinion
in
dalehite.
dalehite
as
you
mentioned,
justice
rehnquist,
involved
a
suit
challenging
a
number
of
activities
by
the
government.
the
court
eventually
held
that
the
suit
was
barred
by
the
discretionary
function
exemptions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
jackson
and
two
other
justices
dissented
in
that
case
on
the
grounds
that
what
the
government
had
been
engaging
in
there
was
operational.
it
was
something
like
what
private
parties
could
do.
therefore,
justice
jackson
thought
the
government
should
be
held
liable
if
it
acted
negligently.
but
justice
jackson
went
on
to
point
out
the
sorts
of
governmental
activities
that
even
he
and
the
other
dissenters
agreed
could
not
be
the
basis
of
a
federal
tort
claims
act
suit.
i
will
just
read
one
sentence
from
justice
jackson's
opinion
because
i
think
it
highlights
a
distinction
we
are
making
here.
justice
jackson
said,
"when
an
official
exerts
governmental
authority
in
a
manner
which
legally
binds
one
or
many
he
is
acting
in
a
way
in
which
no
private
person
could.
"
"such
official
should
be
controlled
solely
by
the
statutory
or
administrative
mandate
and
not
by
the
added
threat
of
private
damage
suits.
"
so
even
the
dissenters
in
dalehite
understood
this
basic
distinction
between
operational
activities
that
the
government
may
engage
in
or
private
people
may
engage
in
and
the
quintessentially
governmental
activities
of
regulation
and
law
enforcement
which
is
what
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
that
it
would
because
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
terms
of
its
construction
of
the
private
person
language
and
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
does
not
rely
on
any
facts
that
are
unique
to
this
case.
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
requires
a
showing
that
the
defendant
has
(1)
performed
a
service
for
another;
and
(2)
that
other
people
including
the
general
public,
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
are
entitled
to
rely
on
that
service.
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
right
about
its
construction
of
those
terms
it
would
presumably
apply
to
every
government
regulatory
activity
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--exactly.
the
occupational
safety
and
health
inspector
goes
in
and
inspects
a
plant
and
negligently,
let's
say,
fails
to
detect--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation,
a
bank
examiner
examines
the
books
of
a
bank
and
negligently
fails
to
discover
that
the
bank
is
failing.
presumably
under
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
the
united
states
could
be
sued
under
the
tort
claims
act
by
bank
depositors
or
creditors
or
shareholders
under
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
because
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
the
united
states
when
it
engages
in
these
regulatory
activities
is
performing
a
service
for
the
public
and
the
public
is
entitled
to
rely
on
it
and
nothing
more
need
be
shown.
i
might
add
that
these
are
not
fanciful
notions,
justice
powell.
there
is
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
a
suit
pending
right
now
against
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
$4
billion
challenging
on
theories
similar
to
those
adopted
by
the
ninth
circuit
the
government's
allegedly
negligent
inspection
and
certification
of
the
three
mile
island
nuclear
power
plant,
the
nuclear
regulary
commission's
allegedly
negligent
certification.
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
in
that
case
was
denied
on
grounds
that
are
quite
similar
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
so
we
believe
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
have
bilateral
treaties
with
a
great
many
countries
that
do
have
similar
arrangements.
brazil
is
one
of
those
countries.
brazil,
in
fact,
issued
an
airworthiness
certificate
to
this
plane
in
1969
when
varig
bought
the
plane
four
years
prior
to
the
crash.
presumably
varig
is
the
brazil
national
airline,
and
brazil
certified
its
own
plane
as
airworthy,
which
adds
to
the
peculiarity
of
varig's
suing
the
united
states
here
for
a
certification
that
the
faa
made
in
1958.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
presumably,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
limiting
principle
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
would
not
allow
it
to
be
extended
to
that
case.
here,
for
example,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
public
in
general
is
entitled
to
rely
on
faa
inspections
even
though
in
the
varig
case
62
of
the
plaintiffs
are
brazilian
residents
who
were
flying
from
rio
de
janeiro
to
paris
on
a
brazilian
airline.
nonetheless,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
reliance
aspect
of
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
was
satisfied.
that
is
the
aspect
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
we
find
particularly
troubling.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
am
afraid
i
do
have
to
respond
to
certain
of
the
misstatements
that
mr.
gerry
made.
let
me
just
respond
first
to
one
of
the
last
things
he
said.
respondent
said
he
does
not
know
where
we
got
this
notion
that
under
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
the
reliance
aspect
requires
a
showing
that
other
ways
of
protecting
one's
self
were
not
exercised.
let
me
just
refer
the
court
to
the
note
e
to
section
324(a)
of
their
statement
of
torts
which
says,
"the
reliance
must
have
induced
the
defendant
to
forego
other
remedies
or
precautions
against
the
risk.
"
we
cite
this
in
our
brief
along
with
cases
that
have
interpreted
that
provision
that
support
our
statement.
the
respondents
have
assured
this
court
that
it
need
not
worry
about
the
peculiar
result
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiffs
will
always
have
to
show
negligence.
let's
be
clear
what
that
means.
there
was
no
proof
in
this
case,
nor
could
there
be
in
any
of
these
cases
that
a
particular
faa
inspector
went
in,
looked
at
a
particular
aircraft
and
determined
that
it
was
all
right
whereas
the
safety
standards
show
it
was
not.
the
proof
in
these
cases
as
in
this
case
in
particular
was
the
following:
an
inspection
had
to
be
made
according
to
the
ninth
circuit
before
a
certificate
could
be
issued.
a
certificate
was
issued.
subsequently,
it
was
determined
that
the
plane
was
not
in
compliance
with
some
safety
standards.
therefore,
the
government
had
to
be
negligent
in
conducting
its
inspection.
it
is
a
res
ipsa
theory.
now
it
falls
down
for
a
number
of
reasons,
one
of
which
is
that
it
is
based
on
this
fallacious
assumption
that
the
government
has
some
obligation
under
the
statute
the
do
a
head
to
toe
inspection
of
every
airplane.
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
realize
that
that
is
simply
not
true
under
the
statute
or
regulations.
the
faa
has
never
done
anything
more
than
conduct
spot
checks
in
particular
cases,
and
it
reserves
the
right
in
any
particular
case
to
inspect
any
part
of
the
airplane.
it
has
no
obligation
under
the
faa
act
or
the
regulations
to
do
so.
there
was
also
a
grudging
admission
from
mr.
gerry
that
the
manufacturers
do
in
fact
have
a
nondelegable
duty
to
make
an
inspection
of
every
part
of
their
equipment
to
make
sure
that
it
is
in
compliance
with
the
safety
regulations
and
that
they
can
be
sued.
in
this
case,
for
example,
varig
did
sue
boeing.
the
passengers
did
sue
varig
and
boeing.
aerodyne
was
sued.
this,
i
think,
precisely
shows
the
distinction
between
these
sorts
of
regulatory
cases
and
the
operational
cases
that
i
was
referring
to
earlier
because
in
the
operational
cases
the
united
states
is
the
only
possible
defendant,
and
the
court
referred
to
this,
for
example,
in
rayonier
in
pointing
out
why
the
operational
activities
in
that
case
were
not
immune
from
suit
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
said
was
that
if
the
united
states,
which
performed
these
operations,
could
not
be
sued,
the
plaintiff
could
not
sue
anyone.
but
in
these
regulatory
cases
there
will
always
be
by
definition
a
private
party,
a
manufacturer,
an
operator,
or
an
installer
that
will
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
safety
standards,
and
that
operator
or
manufacturer
is
liable
to
people
who
are
harmed.
this
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states
for
damages
because
the
united
states
did
not
exercise
its
regulatory
authority
to
make
certain
that
that
manufacturer
or
operator
complied
with
the
statute.
finally,
while
it
may
not
be
terribly
significant
here
i
cannot
let
the
record
reflect
that
there
was,
in
fact,
negligence
in
the
issuance
of
the
type
certificate
for
that
boeing
707.
there
is
zero
proof
in
this
record
that
the
type
certificate
was
in
any
way
faulty.
if
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
case
has
not
yet
gone
to
trial.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
varig
case
has
not
yet
gone
to
trial,
but
mr.
gerry
has
asserted
that
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
negligence
in
that
case.
that
is
disputed.
if
in
fact
the
707
that
crashed
in
1973
had
a
defect
it
is
far
from
clear
that
it
was
a
design
defect
rather
than
a
production
defect
or
a
maintenance
defect.
varig
completely
refurbished
the
inside
of
those
planes
after
it
took
them
out
of
the
united
states
in
1969.
so
those
are
the
sorts
of
problems
that
would
arise
in
cases
like
this.
there
will
never
be
proof
of
actual
negligence.
it
will
be
a
res
ipsa
theory,
and
this
ties
in
with
our
argument
that
these
are
in
fact
discretionary
determinations
because
under
the
statute
it
is
clear
that
the
faa
has
complete
discretion,
which
airplanes
to
inspect
and
how
thorough
that
inspection
should
be.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
at
the
type
stage,
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
even
then,
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
we
do.
nothing
has
changed
since
1958.
designated
engineering
representatives
who
are
not
faa
employees
who
by
and
large
work
for
the
manufacturer
have
the
obligation
to
inspect
the
airplane
to
make
sure
it
is
in
compliance
with
the
faa
regulations,
and
the
faa
reserves
the
right
to
make
spot
checks.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
regulations
make
clear
that
it
is
the
manufacturer
that
has
no
discretion
whether
to
make
the
inspection.
we
do
not
dispute
that.
the
manufacturer
has
an
obligation
to
inspect
its
products
carefully.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
true,
but
that
is
far
from
saying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
but
that
is
also
not
the
basis
for
the
respondents'
suit
in
this
case.
they
are
not
suing
us
for
an
invalid
inspection
performed
by
boeing.
they
are
saying
the
united
states
was
negligent
in
not
conducting
a
careful
enough
inspection,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
decision
whether
to
inspect
and
how
careful
that
inspection
should
be
under
the
statute
is
discretionary.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
which
of
the
two
cases?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
that
will
be
the
case
in
all
of
these
sorts
of
cases,
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
in
allowing
suits
like
this
to
proceed
because
the
united
states
is
not
engaging
in
operational
activities.
it's
merely
engaging
in
regulatory
activities
to
make
sure
that
other
people,
the
private
parties--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
even
if
you
could,
justice
white,
the
problem
is
you
will
never
be
able
to
know
precisely
what
they
inspected
because
they
only
have
a
duty
to
spot
check.
they
may
check
off
a
box
saying
they
inspected
the
fuselage
but
that
will
not
tell
you
whether
they
looked
at
any
particular
part.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
is,
justice
white.
in
fact,
it
is
most
true
at
the
type
stage
because
at
the
type
stage
the
faa
frequently
will
get
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands,
especially
for
an
airplane
like
the
707,
of
documents,
and
it
could
not
possibly...
the
faa
only
has
about
300
inspectors...
it
could
not
possibly
at
the
type
stage
inspect
every
portion
of
every
airplane.
that
is
the
responsibility
of
the
manufacturer
and
the
designated
engineering
representative
who
works
for
the
manufacturer.
thank
you.
