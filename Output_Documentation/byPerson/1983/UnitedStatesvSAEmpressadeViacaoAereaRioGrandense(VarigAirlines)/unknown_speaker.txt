unknown
speaker
what
was
the
time
lapse
between
the
government's
inspection
and
the
accident?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
certificate?
that
was
the--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
the
first
one,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
are
the
various
certificates
cumulative
in
a
sense
that
if
you
miss
something
that
you
should
have
caught
in
the
first
place
you
should
catch
it
in
the
next
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
an
airworthiness
certificate
does
not
necessarily
inspect
for
what
you
would
inspect
for
in
a
type
certificate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
following
the
original
certification
of
airworthiness,
exactly
what
is
the
responsibility
of
the
faa
with
respect
to
inspection?
unknown
speaker
yes,
with
respect
to
each
airplane.
unknown
speaker
it
does
have
some
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
the
manufacturer
or
operator
of
the
aircraft--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
further
certification
of--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
do
check
the
maintenance?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
is
it
all
that
unprecedented
after
the
court's
decisions
in
indian
towing
and
rayonier?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
a
prison
guard
be
sued
by
an
inmate
for
negligence?
unknown
speaker
prison
guard.
unknown
speaker
can
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
no
private
person
would
ever
be
sued
for
running
a
prison
negligently.
unknown
speaker
how
about
negligent
operation
of
a
military
aircraft?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
out
there
carrying
out
a
training
mission,
and
they
negligently
operate
the
aircraft
and
it
crashes.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
how
about--
unknown
speaker
--no
private
person
is
ever
going
to
be
sued
for
running
a
military
aircraft.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
parallel
more
accurately
if
northwest
airlines
falls
on
someone's
house
and
then
destroys
the
house,
northwest
airlines
is
liable.
now,
if
the
army...
if
the
air
force
falls
on
someone's
house,
there
is
a
private
person
liability
analogy.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
private
people
make
inspections.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
faa
relies
on
private
people
to
make
inspections
for
them.
i
suppose
those
private
inspectors
can
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
indian
towing
and
rayonier
and
muniz
to
suggest
that
liability
turned
on
direct
operational
responsibility.
is
this
something
you
are
just
extrapolating
from
facts
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
rejected
the
government's
argument
of
the
government
function
defense
in
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
instead
of
kind
of
assuming
that
these
are
all
either
red
squares
or
black
squares,
would
it
not
be
just
as
accurate
to
say
that
feres
and
dalehite
was
one
mode
of
construction
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
that
indian
towing
and
rayonier
and
muniz
was
a
somewhat
different
one,
and
now
the
government
is
asking
us
to
kind
of
return
to
feres
and
dalehite,
which
i
think
is
perfectly
proper
for
the
government--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
is
almost
impossible
to
reconcile
the
opinion
in
dalehite
with
the
opinion
in
rayonier.
in
fact,
rayonier
says
that
the
dalehite
in
part
is
no
longer
good
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
would
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
apply
to
the
pure
food
and
drug
law?
unknown
speaker
automobile
safety.
unknown
speaker
environmental
protection
agency
action?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
before
you
go
on
do
the
other
countries
who
buy
our
older
airplanes
from
our
airlines,
venezuela,
france,
england,
do
they
have
counterparts
to
our
faa?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
reality
or
assume
it
is
that
throughout
south
america
and
africa
you
will
find
even
old
dc-3's
that
were
purchased
from
our
airlines
still
functioning
on
shuttle
flights.
those
planes
go
back
35,
40
years.
under
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
would
the
crash
of
a
dc-3
down
in
venezuela
or
off
in
ethiopia
open
the
door
to
the
same
kind
of
liability
as
is
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gerry,
with
respect
to
that
last
hypothetical
i
put
to
your
friend,
suppose
to
make
it
more
concrete
the
venezuela
airlines
bought
a
dc-3
from
northwest
airlines
when
those
planes
were
discarded
and
it
has
been
used
in
venezuela
for
20,
25
years
and
then
you
get
the
same
fact
situation
you
have
got
here,
liability
of
the
faa
of
the
united
states
through
faa
inspection?
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
the
same
facts
as
you
have
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
even
if
that
was
20
or
25
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
doubt
that
we
would
have
granted
certiorari
if
we
did
not
feel
this
was
an
issue
of
some
significance.
unknown
speaker
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
were
these
aircraft
subject
to
inspection
in
the
countries
to
which
the
airline's
purchaser
is
attached?
unknown
speaker
in
the
scottish
case
that
you
are
just
referring
to,
what
was
the
time
span
between
the
faa
inspection
and
the
accident?
unknown
speaker
the
scottish
case?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
the
time
on
the
other
case.
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
think
the
negligence
occurred
in
the
varig
case?
unknown
speaker
there
was
not
a
repetition
of
that
negligence
when
the
plane
was
given
an
airworthiness
certificate?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
the
scottish
case?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
a
certificate
was
that?
unknown
speaker
and
again
the
airworthiness
certificate,
there
was
no
negligence
then?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
or
not
the
faa
ever
delegates
to
the
manufacturer
the
issuance
of
the
type
certificate?
unknown
speaker
airworthiness
inspection.
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
certificates
are--
unknown
speaker
--i
know
they
do
not,
but
they
are
not
type
inspections
that
they
delegate.
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
the
scottish
case?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
think
that
does
not
make
any
difference
anyway.
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
has
the
discretion
to
delegate
it
to
somebody
else?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
suppose
there
is
the
discretion
to
delegate
to
a
non-faa
employee
the
job
of
inspection.
unknown
speaker
will
that
make
a
difference
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
of
course
that
did
not
happen,
but
what
if
in
some
other
case
it
happens.
do
you
think
that
would
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gerry.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
argument
that
the
present
law
exempts
the
responsibility
of
the
manufacturer
to
inspect?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the
government
has
got
a
bigger
pouch?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
no
movement
in
that
direction
has
yet
been
taken.
unknown
speaker
do
the
faa
attorneys
have
any
jurisdiction
over
a
question
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
only
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
could
make
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
not
considerable
judgment
or
discretion
in
determining
what
is
excessive
vibration?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gerry,
in
the
dalehite
case
they
said
that
the
decision
as
to
how
to
bag
fertilizer
was
discretionary,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
you
think
we
are
a
long
way
from
dalehite?
unknown
speaker
unless
maybe
it
decided
to
take
care
of
rayonier
and
indian
towing
the
way
you
suggest
those
cases
took
care
of
dalehite.
there
is
a
certain
sinuosity
to
judicial
construction
of
statutes
over
a
period
of
time,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
is
the
inevitable
cigarette
disposal.
unknown
speaker
on
your
theory
as
i
understood
your
previous
response,
mr.
gerry,
25
years
after
the
airplane
was
built
or
30
years
the
united
states
could
be
liable
if
it
falls
in
venezuela
or
zambisi
or
some
other
place.
if
it
is
a
design
certification.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
suggest
it
would
have
been
difficult
to...
if
you
think
this
is
such
a
glaring,
obvious
defect
you
would
not
think
it
would
have
been
very
hard
to
get
a
change.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
there
is
some
incentive
to
produce
a
safe
aircraft.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
have
proof
of
negligence,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
that
a
reasonable
designer
should
have
known
this
was
a
bad
deal.
unknown
speaker
if
technology
developed
subsequent
to
the
original
inspection
and
certification,
it
was
not
generally
known
at
the
time
of
the
certification,
that
would
not
be
the
sort
of
case
that
you
bring
here.
unknown
speaker
the
manufacturer
was
not
available?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
average
person
that
rides
on
a
plane
is
familiar
with
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
that
the
government
has
to
inspect
every
piece
of
that
plane?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
said
so.
unknown
speaker
you
said
the
inspection
examines
every
piece
of
the
plane.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
average
airplane
rider
know
that?
unknown
speaker
if
so,
take
me
out
of
the
group.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
know
it
until
this
case
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
who
that
rides
a
plane
has
read
that
book
that
you
just
read
from,
the
one
where
you
say
the
inspector
does
this?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
name
of
that
book?
unknown
speaker
does
the
average
plane
rider
know
anything
about
that
book?
unknown
speaker
has
the
average
rider
ever
heard
of
that
book?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
argue
that?
you
said
everybody
knows.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding?
unknown
speaker
oh,
the
varig
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
at
the
type
stage.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
not
then.
unknown
speaker
so
you
disagree
with
your
colleague?
unknown
speaker
they
do
not
have
any
discretion
as
to
whether
to
have
an
inspection.
it
is
just
who
has
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
faa
cannot
issue
a
type
certificate
without
there
having
been
an
inspection
by
somebody.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
saying
that
part
of
it
is
not
discretionary.
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
evidence
as
to...
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
who
made
the
inspection
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
in
either
one
of
them?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
in
a
good
many
cases
you
could
discover
who
actually
made
the
inspection.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
true
at
the
type
stage,
is
it?
