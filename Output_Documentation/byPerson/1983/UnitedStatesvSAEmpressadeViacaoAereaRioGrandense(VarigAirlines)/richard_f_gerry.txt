mr.
richard
f.
gerry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
congres
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
decided
decades
ago
that
the
government
should
and
will
be
liable
if
a
private
person
in
like
circumstances
would
likewise
be
liable.
liabilty
is,
of
course,
limited
to
a
finding
of
negligence,
and
legislative,
judicial
and
policy
decisions
are
outside
the
gamut,
but
in
overzealous
performance
of
their
duties
the
lawyers
of
the
justice
department
try
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
the
pre-federal
tort
claims
act
era
when
injured
parties
would
have
to
go
to
congress
in
private
bills
as
they
would
if
turned
away
here
in
order
to
resolve
their
problems
with
the
government.
in
these
cases,
each
of
them,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
government
employees
which
attributed
as
a
proximate
cause
to
the
death
of
128
people
and
the
total
loss
of
two
aircraft.
still,
we
are
here
15
years
after
one
of
these
accidents
and
10
years
after
the
other
trying
to
enforce
the
liability
which
the
congress
itself
decreed
more
than
30
years
ago.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
liability
only
if
in
the
issuance
of
the
original--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--liability
only
if
in
issuance
of
the
original
type
certificate
the
faa
or
its
predecessor,
the
caa,
was
negligent.
the
fact
is--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--the
actual
facts
are,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
time
of
the
certification
of
the
dc-3
the
caa
did
not
conduct
itself
in
the
same
fashion
as
it
did
in
1958
when
it
certified
the
707.
so
i
think
that
such
liability
would
be
remote.
between
the
time
of
the
certification
of
the
dc-3
and
the
time
of
the
certification
of
the
707
the
government
had
continued
to
permeate
the
field
and
to
take
over
the
responsibilities
that
had
previously
been
conducted
by
private
manufacturers.
this
all
started
with
the
private
manufacturers
doing
all
of
the
inspection,
all
of
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
an
aircraft
should
be
released,
and
then
went
on
to
where
we
presently
are
or
were
in
1958
where
only
after
the
faa
had
inspected
each
and
every
part
of
the
aircraft
could
an
aircraft
be
released
to
be
used
by
the
general
public.
so
as
a
practical
matter
the
answer
to
your
question
would
be
no.
as
a
legal
matter,
if
they
negligently
had
done
the
same
in
that
case
as
they
had
in
this,
i
would
think
the
answer
would
have
to
be
yes
because
the
rule
as
i
understand
it
in
the
federal
court
is
that
the
liability
attaches
at
the
time
of
the
impact
of
the
negligence,
not
at
the
time
of
the
actual
negligence
itself.
we
are
here
asking
this
court
to
affirm
these
cases
to
send
a
clear
message
to
the
executive
branch
to
accede
to
the
wishes
of
congress
and
to
cease
clogging
the
courts
with
this
kind
of
litigation
and
to
say
to
the
justice
department
when
it
is
clear
that
negligent
errors
have
been
made
at
the
operational
level
which
cause
death,
injury
or
destruction
of
property
not
to
waste
more
of
the
public
treasury
in
a
futile
struggle
against
the
inevitable
but
to
do
as
private
industry
and
the
insurance
industry
does,
cut
their
losses
by
compromise
and
settlement
and
preserve
the
time
of
the
courts
for
other
possibly
more
difficult
matters.
in
these
cases--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
agree
with
the
court,
and,
justice
rehnguist,
i
think
it
is
an
issue
of
high
significance.
it
has
been
since
union
trust
that
this
court
has
made
a
pronouncement
in
the
aviation
field,
and
i
think
it
is
really
timely
for
the
court
to
again
give
us
guidance
in
this
field.
i
think
that
that
guidance
should
be
that
the--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--obviously.
[laughter]
in
these
cases
the
negligence
of
the
government
employees
is
obvious,
glaring
and
found
by
the
district
court
in
findings
of
fact
in
the
one
case
and
conceded
in
the
other
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
i
am
aware
of
a
question
asked
of
counsel
for
the
government
as
to
whether
or
not
the
inspections
would
have
occurred,
and
there
is
a
finding
of
fact
in
the
united
scottish
case
that
it
is
impossible,
uneconomical,
unreasonable
and
unfeasible
for
an
owner
of
an
aircraft
inspected
and
certificated
by
the
federal
aviation
administration
to
take
down
the
entire
aircraft
and
inspect
it
completely.
that
happens
two
times
where
the
entire
aircraft
or
a
subsequent
installation
is
inspected.
when
the
aircraft
is
originally
certificated
then
it
is
totally
inspected
by
the
faa
and
by
the
manufacturer
also.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
about
two
and
a
half
years,
from
1965
to
1968.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
in
the
scottish
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
no,
the
other
case
was
from
1958
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
original
type
certificate
for
the
boeing
707
and
1968,
the
time
of
the...
1973,
the
time
of
the
accident,
15
years
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
in
the
varig
case,
in
the
original
type
certification,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--no
is
the
answer.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
it
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
initial
installation
of
the
fuel
line,
and
there
was
no--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--that
was
a
supplemental
type
certificate.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
well,
the
airworthiness
certificate
in
the
dove
case
had
initially
been
issued
by
the
british
government--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--some
time
earlier
in
the
fifties.
then
when
the
british
government
issues
a
type
certificate
the
american
government
accepts
that
type
certificate
as
the
brazilian
government
accepts
ours.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
they
never
delegate
the
issuance
of
the
type
certificate,
but
they
do
delegate
at
the
present
time--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--they
delegate
some
inspection
activities
to
designated
representatives
called
designated--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--they
do
not
issue
certificates,
your
honor,
at
all.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
they
do
at
the
present
time
delegate
inspections
that
go
into
making
up
the
type
certificate,
but
they
do
not
delegate
the
authority
for
issuance
of
the
type
certificate
itself.
at
the
time
of
the
varig
aircraft
certification
there
was
not
this
delegation
option
as
far
as
the
type
certification
of
the
boeing
707
according
to
the
testimony
so
far
adduced
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
no.
in
the
scottish
case
there
is
a
specific
finding
of
fact
that
the
inspection
had
to
be
done
under
the
faa's
manual
8110.4,
which
the
court
took
judicial
notice,
had
to
be
done
by
an
faa
inspector.
there
was
testimony
by
the
person
who
signed
that
aircraft
off,
the
head
of
the
section,
that
it
had
to
be
done
by
a
faa
inspector,
could
not
be
done
by
a
licensed,
private
person.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
yes,
i
do
think
it
may
make
a
difference.
obviously
if
the
inspector
has
the
duty
to
do
it
and
that
inspector
is
a
faa
inspector,
then
the
lability
lies
with
the
government.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
no
one
in
the
field
has
that
discretion.
only
the
faa
administrator
can
delegate.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
if
they
do
that--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--not
in
my
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
might
think
it
might,
but
the
government
in
its
manual
says
a
der,
who
is
a
designated
engineering
representative,
while
performing
those
duties
which
are
part
of
his
responsibilities
as
an
agent
of
the
administrator
for
all
intents
and
purposes
becomes
an
employee
of
the
government
and
thereby
may
incur
liability
for
the
united
states
if
he
is
negligent.
now
whether
or
not
that
is
true,
i
do
not
know,
but
it
seems
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
on
the
subject.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
absolutely
not.
contrary
to
what
the
government
says--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--no.
contrary
to
what
the
government
says,
i
think
the
manufacturer
remains
liable,
and
the--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--this
is
like
any
other
area
where
there
is
more
than
one
tort
feasor.
they
are
concurrent
joint
tortfeasors
in
this
case,
and
the
decision
as
to
who
should
bear
the
final
risk
of
loss
here
should
come
in
the
case
that
will
follow
this
when
the
government
sues
for
indemnification
as
its
attorneys
have
publicly
said
that
they
would
do.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
it
has
not,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
final
judgment
and,
therefore,
no
action
filed
for
indemnification
by
the
united
states.
there
has
been
a
publication
by
attorneys
for
the
faa
which
says
that
that
is
their
intention
in
cases
where
the
government
is
found
responsible,
and
under
the
law
of
california
where
we
have
equitable
contribution
i
would
assume
that
they
would
sue
both
for
indemnity
and
for
equitable
contribution.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
they
were
the
attorneys,
however,
responsible
for
the
prosecution
of
these
cases.
as
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
negligence
in
these
cases.
it
was
found
in
the
united
scottish
case
to
be
negligence
and
also
to
be
a
proximate
cause.
it
was
at
an
operational
level.
there
was
no
discretion
left
in--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
believe
that
there
is
judgment,
but
there
is
not
policy
discretion
such
as
that
which
is
provided
in
the
federal
tort
claims
cases,
justice
o'connor.
my
understanding
is
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
exception
found
in
2680(a)
deals
with
administrative
policy
discretion,
and
that
when
only
a
scientific
decision
such
as
in
griffin
v.
united
states
where
obviously
there
was
more
discretion,
a
scientific
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
lot
of
virus
should
be
permitted
to
enter
the
marketplace,
where
only
a
scientific
or
mechanical
or
operational
decision
has
to
be
made
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
discretion
talked
about
in
the
ftca.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
most
respectfully
disagree,
and
i
think
that
we
are
a
long
way
from
dalehite.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--well,
i
think
in
those
cases
that
have
followed
there
is
been
a
great
deal
of
this
court's
interpretation
of
what
was
in
dalehite,
and
although
it
has
not
been
overruled
in
all
of
its
aspects,
as
it
should
not
be,
i
think
in
those
aspects
where
there
was
only
operational
negligence
such
as
in
fire
fighting
that
this
court
has
in
rayonier
taken
care
of
that
problem.
if
a
bagging
case
come
up
i
suppose
the
court
would
take
care
of
that
problem.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
have
found
it
that
way,
your
honor.
[laughter]
we
believe
that
in
this
case
the
government
is
liable
under
the
congressional
mandate
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
there
may
also
be
others
liable,
but
that
is
for
another
case
and
another
time.
we
think
that
we
have
to
point
out
to
the
court
serious
errors
in
the
government's
argument
and
errors
in
the
government's
brief.
on
page
3
of
the
government's
reply
brief
they
say
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
that
the
design
of
the
boeing
707
was
defective.
i
do
not
know
where
they
have
been
in
the
years
that
this
case
has
been
prosecuted
because
contrary
to
their
statement
there
is
not
testimony
whatsoever
that
the
lavatory
trash
container
involved
in
the
707
crash
and
burn
in
paris
could
contain
or
meet
the
requirements
of
4(b)381(d),
and
all
of
the
knowledgeable
witnesses
agree
that
the
containers
were
defective.
the
ntsb
sent
an
investigator,
mr.
kapustin.
mr.
kapustin
looked
at
what
was
left
of
this,
looked
at
several
other
707's
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
page
128
that
it
needed
no
expert
opinion.
you
did
not
even
have
to
be
an
expert.
it
was
a
simple
open
and
shut
situation.
the
compartments
did
not
meet
the
requirements.
they
were
not
capable
of
containing
fire
or
smoke.
mr.
nelson,
the
faa's
own
top
person
who
has
been
deposed
in
this
case,
states
that
the
odds
are
extremely
small
that
any
of
the
items,
that
is,
any
of
the
707
ever
manufactured
after
the
type
certification
were
not
of
type
design,
and
the
lavatories
had
been
approved
that
way
with
the
defect
in
them
in
the
beginning.
they
were
not
in
compliance
with
the
regulations.
these
things
all
appear
in
his
deposition--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--it
has
been,
your
honor.
hopefully
some
day
we
will
not
have
cigarettes
on
airplanes.
at
the
present
time
because
of
this
and
other
cases
we
have
new
placards.
we
have
an
ashtray
outside
the
lavatory
as
you
enter.
all
of
that
occurred
probably
because
of
this
case.
unfortunately
sometimes
we
make
these
advancements
over
the
dead
bodies
of
the
people
who
suffer
from
the
defective
product
to
begin
with.
in
order
to
look
at
this
case,
i
would
like
to
with
the
court
look
just
a
little
bit
at
the
process
that
is
involved
here.
the
federal
aviation
agency...
administration
now...
has
taken
over
over
the
years
the
entire
certification
process
including
the
final
process
in
the
inspection.
now
in
the
government's
brief...
you
may
be
mislead
if
you
read
the
brief
into
thinking
that
the
manufacturing
inspector
is
a
representative
of
the
manufacturer.
in
their
brief
they
suggest
that
the
primary
responsibility
for
all
of
this
remains
with
the
manufacturer,
and
they
cite
a
statute
and
a
regulation
and
then
go
on
to
say,
"finally,
the
agency's
operating
manual
has
always
stated
it
is
the
primary
responsibility
of
manufacturing
inspectors
to
determine
that
prototype
products
conform
with
safety
requirement.
"
in
turn,
the
faa
is
merely
empowered
to
make
safety
inspections.
but
the
manufacturing
inspector
is
an
faa
employee
who
is
there
in
the
manufacturer's
plant
and
who
according
to
their
manual
must...
as
they
say
has
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
manufacturing
inspector
to
determine
that
prototype
products
conform
with
drawing
specifications
and
evaluated.
the
manual
from
1957
which
applies
is
on
file
to
the
court
and
clearly
shows
that
they
have
to
look
at
every
process
and
that
in
this
case
they
did
look
at
every
process
but
missed
this
one.
once
there
is
a
type
certificate
issued--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--if
they
were
negligent
in
the
beginning,
if
the
manufacturer
was
negligent
in
the
beginning,
they
could
if
that
negligence
then
became
operative
at
that
point.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
boeing
707
all
of
the
aircrafts
were
manufactured
according
to
the
type
certificate,
and
the
type
certificate
permitted
huge
holes
in
the
lavatory
trash
container
which
caused
a
chimney
effect
to
take
the
smoke
up
into
the
overhead
and
carry
it
forward
to
the
pilot's
compartment.
those
holes
were
part
of
the
type
certification
of
the
aircraft.
once
you
get
a
type
certification
if
you
are
an
aircraft
manufacturer
you
certainly
do
not
want
to
get
back
in
the
mess
of
bureaucratic
bumbling
that
you
were
in
before
and
attempt
to
change
that
certificate.
you
cannot
make
a
single
change
in
the
aircraft
without
getting
the
kind
of
supplemental
type
certificate
that
is
involved
in
the
other
case,
in
the
united
scottish
case
where
in
order
to
change
anything
you
have
to
go
there.
so
once
you
have
got
it
through
all
of
the
design
and
engineering
changes
you
set
in
concrete
the
bad
aspects
of
the
design
as
well
as
the
good
aspects.
we
sometimes
find
ourselves
flying
with
obsolete
unsafe
or
less
safe
parts
of
aircraft
because
it
is
so
economically
and
otherwise
difficult
to
get
a
change.
there
are
those
who
believe
that--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--no,
i
do
not
think
so
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
the
incentive
is
gone.
once
you've
got
a
type
certificate
you
remove
the
incentive
to
go
forward
and
to
continue
to
change.
the
incentive
is
to
produce
what
has
already
been
authorized.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
yes.
that
is
why
we
have
supplemental
type
certificates
and
that
is
why
there
are
issuances
of
supplemental
type
certificates.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
absolutely.
there
is
no
product
defect
in
the
sense
of
strict
liability.
we
need
to
prove
to
a
federal
judge
sitting
without
a
jury--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--that
is
correct.
we
have
done
so.
we
have
done
so
twice
in
the
united
scottish
case.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
no,
state
of
the
art
has
always
been
a
defense
to
a
negligence
action
even
if
not
to
a
strict
lability
action.
in
fact,
your
honor,
no
knowledgeable
attorney
would
bring
an
action
against
the
united
states
at
all
if
there
was
any
other
way
to
go,
and
wind
up
here
15
years
later
or
wind
up
here
10
years
later
without
even
having
had
a
case
tried.
no,
as
long
as
there
is
another
economically
viable
defendant
we
will
go
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
the
manufacturer
in
the
united
scottish
case
went
out
of
business
and
had
only
$100,000
worth
of
insurance.
the
manufacturer
in
the
varig
case
settled
the
cases
with
some
of
the
passengers
on
the
aircraft.
the
government's
brief
suggests
that
in
order
to
rely
on
the
good
samaritan
doctrine
we
have
to
prove
that
our
decedents
would
have
foregone
alternative
safety
precautions.
i
do
not
know
where
they
get
that
and
they
cite
not
authority
for
that
novel
statement
of
law.
my
understanding
is
that
what
is
necessary
is
to
show
that
there
was
reliance
by
the
people,
not
that
they
have
to
forego,
and
in
this
case...
in
the
united
scottish
case
there
is
a
finding
of
the
court
below
of
specific
and
general
reliance
by
the
decedents
and
by
the
survivors.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
think
the
average
person
that
rides
on
the
plane
anyplace
in
the
united
states
and
the
world,
justice
marshall,
is
familiar
with
the
government's
involvement
in
the
aviation
industry,
that
they--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
do
not
think
that
is
so,
nor
do
i
think--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--well,
no--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
said
that.
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
i
do
not
think
that--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
do
not
think--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
do
not
think
they
do,
nor
did
i
intend
to
say
that
they
knew
that.
what
i
intended
to
say,
your
honor,...
i
am
sorry
if
i
expressed
myself
badly...
was
that
the
average
person
riding
in
an
aircraft
is
aware
of
the
role
of
the
government
in
the
process
of
aviation,
that
they
are
involved.
also,
under
the
restatement
of
torts--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--the
owner
of
the
aircraft--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--this
is
the
manual
procedure
type
certification--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--no,
but
the
owner--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
no.
the
owner
of
the
aircraft
does,
and
under
the
restatement
of
torts
section
324a(b),
there
does
not
need
to
be
reliance
by
the
average
rider
of
the
aircraft.
there
needs
to
be
reliance
only
by
the
owner
of
the
aircraft
and
in--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--i
did
not
mean,
your
honor,
actual
knowledge
of
each
and
every
particular.
i
am
sorry
if
i
was
found
to
mislead
the
court
in
that.
also
the
government
is
liable
if
it
increases
the
risk
of
harm,
and
in
that
regard
i
think
that
there
is
a
misunderstanding
of
what
that
term
means.
it
is
not
the
risk
in
putting
out
an
aircraft
that
is
less
airworthy,
but
it
is
the
risk
of
having
that
aircraft
on
the
market
at
all.
if
the
government
does
their
job
properly,
the
government
inspectors,
the
aircraft
would
not
be
on
the
market
with
the
defects
in
it
and,
therefore,
the
risk
to
the
general
public
including
our
decedents
is
greater
than
it
would
be
otherwise.
there
was
a
statement
by
counsel
that
after
there
is
the
issuance
of
the
type
certificate
there
are
no
further
inspections
of
the
particular
aircraft
by
the
faa.
that,
although
it
is
not
extremely
important
to
the
decision
here,
is
not
the
total
fact
in
the
case.
there
are
additional
inspections
if
there
are
supplemental
type
certificates
as
there
were
in
united
scottish
and
there
was
such
an
inspection
so
held.
the
government
has
raised
a
number
of
defenses
in
the
case
including
negligent
misrepresentation.
we
had
thought
that
that
had
been
put
to
rest
in
block
v.
neal,
and
the
government
had
said
in
their
reply
brief
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
unless
there
was
proof
that
the
persons
in
this
case
had
relied
on
the
certificate
itself
that
the
misrepresentation
defense
would
not
apply.
there
is
no
proof
in
the
case
that
any
of
the
passengers
ever
saw
or
relied
upon
the
certificate
itself
or
on
the
airworthiness
certificate
that
was
carried
in
the
airplane.
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
record
adequately
shows
and
it
has
been
found
in
the
case
that
was
permitted
to
go
to
trial
that
the
government
inspectors
at
the
operational
level
were
negligent,
that
their
negligence
was
a
proximate
cause
of
the
deaths
and
destruction
of
the
aircraft
here,
that
that
gives
rise
to
liability,
that
it
does
not
bring
into
play
because
of
the
operational
level
the
descretionary
function
exception
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
and
that
when
the
government
asks
this
court
to
become
the
protector
of
the
treasury
they
should
instead
go
as
they
were
instructed
to
do
in
the
indian
towing
and
rayonier
cases
to
the
congress
and
have
congressional
changes
in
the
bill.
if
congress
did
not
wish
to
have
liability
in
these
cases
it
can
change,
and
if
the
federal
aviation
agency
does
not
wish
to
be
sued
in
these
cases,
it
does
not
have
to
be--
mr.
richard
f.
gerry
--this
much
involved
in
aviation.
thank
you.
