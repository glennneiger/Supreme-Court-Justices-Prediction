mr.
crenshaw,
i
suppose
the
fourth
circuit
has
determined
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
these
things
were
personal
property.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event
that
was
the
fourth
circuit's
determination,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
do
we
not
normally
defer
to
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
determination
on
state
law
issues
and
leave
that
alone?
unknown
speaker
is
it
essential
to
your
argument
that
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
about
what
kind
of
property?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suppose
that
is?
it
seems
so
strange
that
no
discussion
of
that
emerged.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
in
the
language
of
the
relocation
act
in
defining
a
person
it
did
not
admit
of
any
exception,
and
i
think
it
is
just
strange
that
there
would
not
be
some
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
utility
problem.
unknown
speaker
does
the
uniform
act
apply
to
all
federal
condemnations?
unknown
speaker
including
highways?
unknown
speaker
what
relocation
expenses
so-called
are
they
claiming?
the
cost
of
filling
up
the
holes,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
a
new
manhole.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
if
the
city
just
closed
the
street,
for
example,
and
there
was
not
any
so-called
move
at
all
there
would
not
be
any
claim
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
that
washington,
d.c.
builds
a
convention
center
that
covers
two
or
three
blocks
and
you
cannot
go
up
and
down
tenth
street
any
more.
they
closed
that
street.
they
built
a
building
on
it.
i
suppose
the
utilities
took
their...
suppose
they
filled
up
their
manholes
in
that
street.
under
their
claim
in
this
case
they
would
not
have
claimed
anything.
unknown
speaker
for
just
filling
up
the
holes?
unknown
speaker
unless
you
have
already
got
a
utility
line
in
some
other
street
that
would
serve
the
purpose.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
the
solicitor
general
has
changed
his
mind
in
this
case
from
the
time
of
petition
for
certiorari.
am
i
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
insisting
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
change
your
mind.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
that
is
not
the
extent
of
your
prior
position.
unknown
speaker
your
prior
position
was
that
this
was
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
have
changed
your
mind
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
little
problem.
the
difference
between
personal
property
and
real
property
is
determined
by
state
law.
unknown
speaker
it
is
ordinarily
any
way.
do
you
know
any
other
way
to
determine
it?
unknown
speaker
could
the
federal
statute
say
that
property
in
a
manhole
in
virginia
is
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
can
a
statute
say
that,
a
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
then
next
they
can
say
a
man
is
a
woman
in
virginia.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
did
that
bill
go
through
the
same
committee
that
this
bill,
the
uniform
relocation
act,
would
have
gone
through?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
how
relevant
it
is
if
you
do
not
really
have
any
knowledge
that
the
same
individuals
on
a
committee
compared
the
two
and
chose
to
leave
them
the
way
they
were.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
you
used
the
word
"moving"
a
moment
ago
in
your
argument.
these
facilities
were
never
moved
were
they?
unknown
speaker
are
there
two
manholes
out
there
where
there
used
to
be
one?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
did
they
take
up
the
manhole
and
move
the
manhole
to
another
place?
unknown
speaker
so
they
were
not
moved,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
will
help
you?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
will
help
you?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
interpretive
history
that
will
help
you
in
saying
that
this
is
what
you
mean
by
moving?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
you
cited
a
hardware
case.
what
else
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
had
a
power
line
on
one
land
and
built
a
brand
new
power
line
on
another
man's
land
that
would
not
be
moving
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
moving?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
will
you
look
at
section
202(a)
that
is
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with
the
statute.
it
talks
about
whenever
the
acquisition
of
real
property,
et
cetera,
and
then
it
tells
what
you
can
recover
for.
the
first
is
actual,
reasonable
expenses.
the
second
is
actual
direct
losses,
and
the
third
is
actual
reasonable
expenses
in
searching
for
replacement.
does
your
claim
come
under
(a)(1)?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
claiming
actual
direct
losses
of--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
not
claiming
under
(2)
then
that
it
is
actual
direct
losses
of
tangible
personal
property
as
a
result
of
moving.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
where
you
get
that
measure
of
damages
under
(1)
which
simply
talks
about
actual
reasonable
expenses
in
moving
himself,
his
family,
business,
farm
operation
or
other
personal
property.
it
does
not
seem
to
allow
the
kind
of
computation
you
made.
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
does
not
say
cost.
it
says
expenses.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
do
not
move
your
line
at
all,
if
you
do
not
move
the
physical
personal
property
out
of
the
ground
how
can
you
have
any
actual
reasonable
expenses
incurred
in
moving
it?
unknown
speaker
what
section
of
the
statute
is
it
that
defines
carefully
the
expenses
incurred
in
moving
a
business?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
all
i
see...
i
am
looking
on
the
statute
involved
section
of
your
brief,
the
red
brief,
at
page
vii
and
viii,
and
all
i
see
set
off
for
(7)
is
the
term
"business"
means
any
lawful
activity,
excepting
a
farm
operation
conducted
primarily
for
the
sale
of
services
to
the
public.
unknown
speaker
now
you
have
got
a
proviso
in
(2),
4622(a)(2)
where
you
say
you
can
also
include
"actual
direct
losses
of
tangible
personal
property
as
a
result
of
moving
or
discontinuing
a
business.
"
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
"but
not
to
exceed
an
amount
equal
to
the
reasonable
expenses
that
would
have
been
required
to
relocate
such
property
as
determined
by
the
head
of
the
agency.
"
so
that
sets
a
ceiling
on
the
kind
of
damage
you
are
claiming
of
the
amount
of
expenses
you
have
incurred
to
relocate.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
i
guess
the
lower
courts
have
not
resolved
these
questions
yet
have
they?
they
just
were
dealing
with
whether
the
utilities
were
covered
at
all
and
then
were
going
to
send
it
back
to
resolve
some
of
these
things.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kelly,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rely
on
the
provision
that
pertains
to
the
moving
of
a
business?
they
relied
on
the
moving
of
personal
property
as
i
remember
the
opinion.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
mention
4637.
unknown
speaker
but
moving
the
lines
is
a
question--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
question
of
moving
a
business
they
did
not
really
face
up
to?
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
one
might
argue...
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
right
or
not...
that
that
thinks
in
terms
of
moving
an
entire
business
or
moving
a
facility
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
did
they
agree
that
the
move
of
the
personal
property
was
a
move
made
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition
of
real
estate?
unknown
speaker
can
i
go
back
to
when
i
raised
the
point?
does
the
record
still
show
that
there
were
two
manholes?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
in
the
world
can
you
say
you
moved
them?
you
moved
one
that
did
not
move.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
if
we
can
put
a
grain
elevator
into
commerce
we
can
do
that.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
