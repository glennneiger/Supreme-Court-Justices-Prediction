mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
the
court
of
appeals
has
misinterpreted
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
federal
uniform
relocation
assistance
act.
it
is
our
submission
that
that
act
was
never
intended
to
address
the
question
of
who
should
bear
the
cost
of
reconstructing
utility
lines
when
those
lines
are
recreated
in
a
new
location
because
of
local
public
improvements
in
the
very
streets
in
which
they
have
been
located
pursuant
to
local
franchises.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
there
has
been
some
change,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
our
recommendation
to
the
court
most
forthrightly
was
that
the
petition
should
be
denied.
i
take
it
that
is
a
moot
question.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
have
to
that
degree
certainly...
well,
the
question
is
no
longer
presented
whether
the
court
should
have
granted
the
petition.
the
petition
has
been
granted.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
is
right.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
if
i
may
continue,
justice
white,
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
have
concluded
that
it
is
an
erroneous
construction
of
the
statute.
the
position
we
urge
is
the
same
one
we
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
if
i
might
just
say
this,
our
reason
for
concluding
that
it
is
erroneous
is
based
frankly
on
a
closer
study
of
the
statute.
we
believe
that
we
have
identified
concrete
statutory
language
that
this
claim
simply
does
not
fit.
so
that
contrary
to
what
we
said
in
the
unfortunate
brief
we
filed
at
the
petition
stage,
this
case
simply
does
not
in
our
view
involve
interpolating
an
exception
into
plain
statutory
language
that
covers
the
situation.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
involved,
and
if
that
were
true
the
court
of
appeals
might
be
right.
but
we
believe
that
the
statutory
requirement
which
says
that
payment
shall
be
made
for
moving
of
personal
property
or
for
moving
one's
self
or
one's
business
simply
cannot
comfortably
be
made
to
cover
the
situation
of
reconstructing
utility
lines.
i
think
the
words
are
important,
and
the
reality
is
important.
this
really
is
a
construction
job.
the
respondent...
i
refer
to
c&p
as
the
respondent...
says
in
their
answering
brief
that
we
are
in
no
position
to
deny
that
their
claims
represent
certain
matters.
one
of
the
things
they
say
they
represent
are
the
costs
of
reconstructing
those
lines.
i
take
that
to
be
a
concession
that
what
we
are
talking
about
for
the
largest
part
is
the
cost
of
digging
new
trenches,
pouring
new
concrete,
installing
new
pipes,
laying
and
installing
new
cables,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
very
odd
choice
of
words
indeed
to
use
the
words
"moving
personal
property"
if
one
wanted
to
describe
those
operations
and
paying
for
those
costs.
if
i
might
turn
to
something
justice
o'connor
asked,
the
court
is
not
confronted
necessarily
with
the
question
of
whether
the
fourth
circuit
misunderstood
virginia
law.
there
is
a
question
here
whether
this
equipment,
these
lines
are
real
or
personal
property.
the
government
is
skeptical
of
the
fourth
circuit's
conclusion
that
it
is
all
personal
property.
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
has
lodged
with
the
clerk
an
illustration
of
a
sample
utility
manhole
which
is
as
far
as
we
can
see
an
underground
building,
and
if
you
look
closely
at
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
simply
misunderstood
what
the
physical
equipment
involved
was
and
what
the
operation
of
replacing
it
was.
the
court
of
appeals
appears
to
have
believed
that
this
equipment
was
removed
from
its
location
and
transferred
to
a
new
location.
because
of
that
misunderstanding
i
think
the
ordinary
deference
to
the
court
of
appeals
reading
of
state
law
is
not
required
here.
but
even
if
it
were,
the
question
necessarily
presented
is
a
federal
one,
the
question
of
what
congress
meant
by
"moving".
that
is
the
term
in
the
federal
statute
as
to
which
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
state
law
was
intended
to
be
controlling.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
ordinarily
we
would
say
that
would
be
true
but--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if
the
federal
statute
indicated
an
intent
otherwise,
but
in
this
case
we
do
not--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
federal
statute
does
not--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--a
federal
statute
could
say
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute
the
term
"personal
property"
shall
include
the
following,
and
the
congress
could
choose
that
manner
of
legislating.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
is
what
it
has
done
here.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
congress
probably
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
again
that
is
not
the
mode
of
analysis
by
which
we
perceive
congress
has
used
the
term
'moving
personal
property
"or
moving
it
itself.
"
"we
think
that
that
choice
of
language
does
not
comfortably
apply
to
this
process
of
abandoning
capital
facilities
and
recreating
new
ones
in
new
locations.
"
we
would
submit
that
at
a
minimum
this
language
"moving
personal
property"
is
sufficiently
ambiguous
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
stop
with
the
statutory
language,
and
it
is
sensible
to
go
beyond
it
and
look
at
the
usual
indicia
of
legislative
intent.
in
this
case
the
first
thing
we
are
confronted
by
is
the
rather
stark
silence
in
the
ten
year
long
legislative
record,
and
i
might
add
that
representatives
of
the
american
right
of
way
association
which
represents
the
interests
of
the
utilities
insofar
as
rights
of
way
are
concerned
did
speak
at
the
hearings
on
this.
but
they
never
suggested
that
this
statute
would
or
that
it
should
alter
the
established
common
law
rule.
accordingly,
while
this
would
be
an
easier
case
if
someone
has
said
the
obvious,
it
appears
to
us
that
everyone
understood
that
this
issue,
the
question
of
relocation
assistance,
was
one
that
was
governed
by
a
well-established
rule
of
state
law
and
that
absent
any
indication
of
an
intent
to
change
it
congress
must
have
intended
to
leave
it
where
it
was
especially
because
in
1956
in
the
highway
act
congress
had
demonstrated
that
it
was
aware
of
the
state
law
rule
and
that
it
chose
for
highway
act
purposes
to
defer
to
that
state
rule.
now
the
uniform
relocation
act
does
not
say
except
insofar
as
provided
by
other
law
the
following
payments
shall
be
made.
it
says
all
federal
acquisition
shall
be
controlled
and
federally
assisted
acquisitions
shall
be
controlled
by
this
statutory
scheme.
given
that,
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
understand
why
congress
apparently
quite
deliberately
left
in
effect
provisions
of
the
highway
act
which
said
thou
may
pay
relocation
assistance
but
only
if
state
law
provides
for
it.
if
there
were
any
question
left
in
the
wake
of
that
act
in
1972
when
congress
turned
to
the
question
again
in
the
district
of
columbia
public
utilities
reimbursement
act
when
congress
provided
specifically
for
the
purposes
of
interstate
highways
that
these
monies
should
be
paid,
that
portion
of
the
statute
would
have
had
precisely
no
effect
and
would
have
been
entirely
superfluous
if
the
uniform
relocation
act
in
1970
had
set
aside
the
rule
of
section
123
of
the
highway
act.
as
it
happened,
congress
did
set
aside
other
provisions
of
the
highway
act,
title
23,
sections
501
and
the
following
sections
which
dealt
with
other
provisions
of
relocation
assistance.
so
one
cannot
even
say
that
congress
might
have
overlooked
the
highway
act.
if
you
go
through
this
statute
and
if
you
go
through
the
house
and
senate
committee
reports
you
will
find
an
extraordinarily
detailed
listing
set
out
in
haec
verba
of
each
of
the
statutory
texts
that
was
repealed
in
many
sections
of
the
highway
act
that
are
to
be
found
there.
it
is
just
very
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
congress
just
missed
this.
it
appears
that
congress
chose
to
leave
section
123
and
its
rule
which
defers
to
state
law
in
effect.
there
is
another
thing
that
one
can
garner
from
looking
at
the
several
occasions
on
which
congress
has
addressed
the
question
of
relocation
assistance.
congress
has
used
different
language
to
speak
to
this.
in
the
district
of
columbia
act
of
1972
congress
spoke
of
abandoning,
relocating,
reconstructing,
reestablishing,
and
used
a
large
number
of
terms
which
speak
to
the
capital
building
process.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
i
am
skeptical
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
think
we
have
something
special
because
there
are
three
stages
to
this.
there
is
section
123.
there
is
the
uniform
act,
and
there
is
the
d.c.
act
while
perhaps
the
action
of
one
committee
in
1972
does
not
say
that
much
about
what
the
1970
congress
though
the
entire
statute
that
was
enacted
would
have
been
of
no
effect
at
all.
i
would
question
whether
we
ought
to
attribute
that
intent
of
congress
in
1972.
we
would
suggest
that
when
congress
wishes
to
address
this
subject
it
knows
how
to
do
so
and
that
it
did
not
do
so
in
the
uniform
relocation
act
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
accordingly
should
be
reversed.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does
not.
i
think
the
clear
sense
of
that
section
is
altogether
different
from
that.
it
sets
a
ceiling
on
an
expense
we
do
not
claim
here.
no
item
of
our
claim
is
for
the
loss
of
property
we
left.
the
sense
of
that
section
(2)
is
to
cover
the
very
common
situation
very
likely
to
arise
in
which
the
owner
of
property
that
is
not
taken
because
it
is
not
part
of
the
land
still
like
these
manholes
not
feasible
to
move
bodily.
the
owner
may
just
abandon
and
give
up.
he
may
never
find
another
place
for
part
of
his
business,
and
yet
he
is
a
displaced
person
because
he
moved
his
business.
he
just
did
not
move
that
part,
and
he
abandoned
and
lost
it
in
place
and
never
reconstructed
it
anywhere
or
in
any
other
sense
moved
it.
in
such
case
he
just
loses
that
property
and
that
would
be
an
expense
borne
by
him,
not
borne
by
anyone
else.
yet
one
of
the
burdens,
the
expenses
that
that
project
required
some
persons
to
pay
and
the
sense
of
the
act
is
that
he
should
be
reimbursed
for
that
loss.
that
would
occur--
