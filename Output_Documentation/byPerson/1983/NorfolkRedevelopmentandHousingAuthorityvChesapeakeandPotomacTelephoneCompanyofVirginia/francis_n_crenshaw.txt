mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
telephone
company
is
eligible
under
the
terms
of
the
uniform
relocation
assistance
and
real
properties
acquisition
policies
act
of
1970
to
be
reimbursed
for
its
costs
when
it
disconnects
transmission
lines
beneath
certain
streets
in
the
city
of
norfolk,
virginia
and
rebuilds
replacement
lines
under
new
streets.
the
claim
was
submitted
to
the
petitioner,
redevelopment
authority,
and
was
denied
because
it
felt
that
the
common
law
requires
a
utility
company
to
move
its
transmission
lines
at
its
expense,
and
the
uniform
act
did
not
change
the
common
law.
furthermore,
the
telephone
company
did
not
meet
the
threshold
requirements
for
eligibility
under
the
uniform
act
because
it
did
not
move
personal
property,
and
it
did
not
move
any
property
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition
of
land.
now
the
telephone
company
had
installed
its
facilities
in
the
streets
of
norfolk
pursuant
to
a
franchise
with
the
city
of
norfolk
by
virtue
of
which
it
had
a
mere
license.
it
was
a
franchisee
and
it
is
the
established
common
law
in
virginia
and
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
other
states
that
a
utility
company
having
such
a
franchise
has
the
obligation
of
moving
its
lines
at
its
own
expense
when
the
public
good
requires
those
lines
to
be
relocated.
this
a
long-standing
and
well
understood
and
respected
custom
and
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
would
change
that
rule.
now
in
this
case
these
transmission
lines
were
rerouted
because
of
the
execution
by
the
petitioner,
redevelopment
authority,
of
conservation
and
redevelopment
projects
within
the
city
of
norfolk.
under
those
projects
areas
of
blighted
property
were
acquired.
the
old
buildings
were
demolished
and
the
cleared
land
was
made
available
for
redevelopment.
in
certain
instances
it
was
necessary
and
desirable
to
rearrange
certain
streets,
and
the
redevelopment
authority
petitioned
the
city
of
norfolk
to
close
streets
so
that
the
new
street
pattern
could
be
established.
the
city
did
close
those
streets,
and
in
a
very
cooperative
manner
the
city,
the
petitioner
and
the
city
of
norfolk
worked
together
with
the
telephone
company
to
work
out
an
arrangement
for
the
new
streets
to
be
built
in
a
manner
that
the
public
and
the
private
utilities
could
be
laid
within
those
streets
with
a
minimum
of
inconvenience
to
all
of
the
parties.
there
was
no
coercion
no
eminent
domain.
it
was
all
done
in
a
friendly
and
matter-of-fact
way,
and
there
was
no
request
for
any
reimbursement.
over
a
year
after
the
redevelopment
work
had
been
done
and
the
new
streets
had
been
laid
the
telephone
company
filed
its
claim
which
had
been
denied.
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
recognize
the
nature
of
the
facilities
that
are
here
involved.
by
and
large
they
are
massive.
they
are
permanent.
they
are
embedded
in
the
ground,
and
we
have
contended
that
they
have
become
real
estate.
they
consist
primarily
of
conduits
which
are
about
four
inches
in
diameter
which
carry
cooper
cables
which
have
as
many
as
3600
pairs
in
them.
those
conduits
extend
between
underground
vaults
which
are
known
as
manholes.
these
manholes
are
larger
than
a
man
is
tall.
they
are
like
a
little
subterranean
womb.
the
walls
are
a
foot
thick.
they
have
a
collar
that
connects
the
top
of
the
manholes
to
the
street
and
when
the--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
the
fourth
circuit
must
have
been
persuaded
by
the
telephone
company's
interpretation
of
transcontinental
which
is--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--i
think
that
is
a
reasonably
fair
statement.
i
think
there
is
a
little
equivocation
there,
yes.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
i
would
think
so,
but
the
difficulty
here
is
i
think
you
had
a
flat
out
decision
by
the
virginia
supreme
court
which
is
contrary
to
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
my
judgment
was
a
not
too
exhaustively
reasoned
opinion
with
respect
to
that
so
that
i
think
that
it
is
not
facetious
for
me
to
assert
in
this
court
that
these
facilities
were
in
effect
real
property
and
not
personal
property.
manifestly
they
are
so
massive
and
so
connected
that
they
have
to
be
real
property,
and
the
case
transcontinental
which
was
cited
by
both
parties
in
this
case
holds
that
underground
gas
mains
are
real
property,
and
the
rationale
that
the
fourth
circuit
relied
upon
is
a
rather
small
point
which
was
not
really
applied
to
the
underground
mains
but
was
applied
to
machinery
that
was
in
the
transcontinental
case.
that
is
the
reason
that
i
mention
that
here.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
there
are
three
bases
on
which
i
would
contend
that
the
claim
would
be
denied.
that
is
one
of
them.
i
do
not
have
to
win
on
all
three,
but
i
think
they
are
all
three
sound.
the
first
one
is
that
the
act
did
not
cover
utilities
at
all.
this,
i
think,
is
the
most
compelling
argument.
the
uniform
act
was
passed
after
a
decade
of
extensive
congressional
committee
inquiry.
it
followed
a
prior
decade
when
the
highway
statutes
had
been
considered.
during
the
1950's
the
federal-aid
highway
statutes
came
along
and
in
those
hearings
there
was
expressed
and
careful
attention
to
the
requirements
of
the
utility
companies.
the
highway
act
contains
section
123
which
dealt
with
utility
companies.
contrarywise
during
the
1960's
when
the
hearings
were
being
held
on
the
uniform
relocation
act
there
was
no
congressional
inquiry
into
the
plight
of
the
utilities.
there
were--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--the
only
reason
that
i
can
say
is
that
the
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
solution
given
by
the
highway
act
because
that
solution
which
was
in
section
123
was
retained.
it
was
not
changed.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
i
think
it
is
strange
that
in
all
of
those
hearings
with
the
hundreds
really
of
representatives
that
there
was
no
movement
by
utilities
to
have
had
their
particular
problem
addressed.
i
think
that
the
overwhelming
reason
was
that
the
uniform
relocation
act
dealt
with
the
acquisition
of
private
property
by
and
large
from
individuals
and
small
businesses.
the
c&p
does
not
have
private
property.
it
does
not
have
a
compensable
property
interest
in
its
franchise.
the
fugate
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
held
that
their
interest
as
a
licensee
does
not
amount
to
a
compensable
property
interest
so
that
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
uniform
act
was
to
help
those
people
whose
property
was
being
taken
by
eminent
domain
and
to
supplement
the
benefits.
the
people
who
were
getting
fair
market
value
under
the
principles
of
eminent
domain
were
not
being
fairly
treated.
a
hardware
store,
for
example,
that
was
in
a
redevelopment
project
if
their
property
was
condemned
they
would
get
the
fair
market
value
of
the
building,
but
unless
they
got
relocation
costs
they
would
not
get
the
cost
to
move
to
a
new
location
and
they
had
to
compete
against
another
hardware
store
in
the
community
who
had
the
fair
market
value
of
their
property.
it
had
not
been
taken,
but
they
did
not
have
to
move.
that
was
the
kind
of
disproportionate
burden
that
i
think
the
committees
looked
into.
the
statistics
are
overwhelming
that
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
they
inquired
about.
i
think
the
statute
had
primarily
humanitarian
interests,
the
small
person,
the
mom
and
pop
business,
those
things
who
moved
personal
property
in
the
common
ordinary
sense
of
personal
property.
i
just
do
not
see
anywhere
in
this
statute
or
its
legislative
history
any
contemplation
of
the
problem
of
utility
lines,
and
as
the
district
court
noted
this
matter
was
not
under
the
table
or
hidden
or
secret
at
all.
there
was
a
live
controversy
right
across
the
potomac
in
virginia
where
pepco
and
the
virginia
highway
commission
were
going
through
all
sorts
of
litigation
about
this
very
matter,
but
it
was
related
to
section
123
of
the
highway
act
so
that
i
think
that
the
act
just
simply
did
not
contemplate
it.
when
you
compare
the
uniform
act
to
actions
of
the
congress
before
the
highway
statute
or
actions
of
the
congress
afterwards,
in
1972
it
adopted
legislation
which
permitted
relocation
costs
to
utilities
in
the
district
of
columbia.
specifically
the
committees
dealt
with
that
problem.
they
recognized
that
if
they
did
not
pass
this
the
utility
companies
would
not
be
compensated,
and
that
was
two
years
after
the
uniform
act.
again,
this
past
may
in
the
senate
they
have
adopted
amendments
to
this
very
statute
that
we
are
talking
about.
i
realize
this
is
after
this
claim
and
after
this
decision,
but
still
it
is
the
same
committee
of
congress.
it
is
the
same
thrust
that
is
being
explained.
i
think
that
the
action
by
the
congress
or
the
senate
this
last
may
is
very
revealing
about
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
yes,
it
does.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
yes,
it
does.
with
respect
to
the
highways
it
is
interesting
that
chapter
5
of
the
highway
act
was
amended
and
repealed,
but
section
123
of
the
highway
act
which
pertained
to
utilities
was
left
exactly
as
it
was
so
that
the
uniform
act
came
up
and
sat
on
top
of
section
123.
it
refers
to
the
comment
by
justice
powell
in
the
previous
case.
there
you
have
a
specific
statute,
section
123,
which
deals
with
utility
relocation.
you
have
a
general
statute,
the
uniform
relocation
act,
which
was
passed
in
foreknowledge
of
the
highway
statute
which
says
nothing
about
it.
i
think
that
simply
shouts
out
that
the
uniform
act
does
not
contemplate
utilities.
there
are
21
federal
agencies
which
administer
some
50
programs
that
are
affected
by
this
act.
none
of
them
have
regulations
which
pertain
to
utility
relocation.
hud
which
is
the
agency
which
was
involved
here
has
a
specific
regulation
that
the
relocation
costs
for
a
utility
transmission
line
is
not
an
eligible
cost
unless
the
state
law
requires
it.
that
regulation
was
in
effect
before
the
uniform
act.
it
is
in
effect
after
the
uniform
act
and
there
was
no
change
by
hud.
so
surely
the
agencies
which
interpret
this
act
as
well
as
the
utility
companies
in
the
localities
have
dealt
with
this
act
as
not
including
utilities.
now
there
are
two
threshold
requirements.
i
have
alluded
briefly
to
one,
that
is,
you
must
move
personal
property.
i
contend
that
it
is
not
personal
property.
i
think
these
facilities
manifestly
are
real
property,
but
secondly
they
were
not
moved.
when
the
street
was
discontinued
the
collar
to
this
vault
that
i
described
was
destroyed.
the
vaults
themselves
were
filled
with
sand
and
abandoned.
the
conduits
were
abandoned
and
the
cable
which
was
in
the
conduits
was
withdrawn
and
sold
for
salvage
where
it
was
profitable
to
do
so.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
justice
white,
it
is
a
little
hard
for
me
honestly
to
answer
that
because
we
have
not
got
into
damages.
the
claims
are
very
stark.
they
have
not
been
flexed
out
at
all.
but
my
impression
of
those
claims
is
the
cost
of
constructing
in
the
new
streets--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--the
new
facility,
right.
so
there
is
not
any
movement
from
point
a
to
point
b,
but
it
is
a
discontinuance
in
the
old
street
and
a
new
building
job
in
the
new
street.
it
is
a
construction
job,
not
a
move.
i
think
the
last
threshold
requirement
is
that
the
real
property
must--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--well,
i
will
say
this.
if
the
city
simply
closed
the
street
and
there
was
no
redevelopment
project,
no
acquisition--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--i
think
they
would
have
claimed
and
the
reason
i
say
that--
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
--no,
the
claim
is
far
more
than
filling
up
the
holes.
we
would
give
them
the
money
to
fill
up
the
holes.
but
the
point...
when
they
terminate
a
block
here
they
have
to
build
a
new
block
there
because
the
service
has
got
to
be
continued.
ordinarily
these
lines
are
through.
they
are
not
just
serving
little
blocks,
but
these
are
transmission
lines
which
go
the
extent
of
the
city.
if
you
cut
one
here
you
have
got
to
loop
it
around
so
it
connects
to
another
place.
you
have
got
to
keep
the
service
going.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
right.
now
i
do
think
if
they
discontinued
a
line
and
did
not
connect
somewhere
else
i
do
no
know
of
any
claim.
but
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
francis
n.
crenshaw
i
have
just
a
couple
of
words
if
i
might,
sir.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
complaint
at
paragraph
7
alleges
that
these
lines
were
moved.
the
redevelopment
authority's
answer
at
paragraph
7
denies
those
allegations.
the
stipulation...
that
is
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix...
which
refers
to
the
term
c&p
has
removed.
then
we
stipulate
that
then
any
that
have
been
removed
were
removed
subject
january
the
2nd.
i
do
not
think
we
have
articulated
well
our
argument
on
removal,
but
it
certainly
has
been
in
the
case.
the
second
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
this
statute
was
passed
to
supplement
benefits
of
people
whose
private
property
was
taken.
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
the
acquisition
or
the
removal
or
reconstruction
of
lines
in
public
property.
the
public
street
was
where
the
lines
were.
when
the
streets
were
closed
the
redevelopment
authority
owned
them.
it
is
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
it
is
still
public
property.
nowhere
in
this
are
we
talking
about
taking
a
compensable
property
interest,
and
the
telephone
company
has
not
cited
and
i
do
not
believe
they
can
cite
any
case
in
which
benefits
under
the
relocation
statute
are
conferred
unless
there
is
the
acquisition
of
a
compensable
interest
in
real
property.
we
think
the
claim
should
be
denied.
thank
you.
