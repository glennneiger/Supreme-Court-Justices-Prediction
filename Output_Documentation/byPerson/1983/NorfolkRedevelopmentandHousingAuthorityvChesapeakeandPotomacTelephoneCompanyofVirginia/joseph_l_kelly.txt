mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
we
should
first
make
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
uncertainty
on
the
record
in
this
case
about
the
nature
of
the
telephone
company's
claim,
the
nature
of
the
expenses
for
which
it
claims.
there
is
no
need
to
speculate
from
what
is
said
in
the
briefs
whether
they
correctly
described
them.
those
claims
were
filed
in
the
beginning
and
have
been
in
the
possession
of
both
petitioner
and
the
federal
defendant
since
that
time
and
still
are.
those
claims
are
for
the
nonbetterment
cost
of
reconstructing,
the
nonbetterment
cost
of
moving
utility
lines,
a
completely
familiar
concept
that
is
observed
and
applied
every
day.
it
involves
determining
the
true
cost
of
moving
by
starting
with
the
cost
of
rebuilding
which
is
inevitably
required
whenever
you
move
a
utility
line
for
the
most
part
unless
there
happened
to
be
overhead
poles
that
can
be
moved
or
wires
that
can
be
moved
and
used
again
which
would
be
exceptional.
but
in
all
events
in
the
multitude
of
cases
in
which
a
utility
company
moves
its
lines
at
the
expense
of
someone
else
whether
by
contract
or
under
voluntary
arrangement
at
the
time
the
parties
well
understood
here
from
the
beginning
from
the
time
these
claims
were
filed
as
they
understood
when
they
stipulated
that
a
similar
expense
if
it
happened
to
be
a
municipal
system,
stipulated
in
those
words
in
this
case,
that
the
nonbetterment
cost
if
it
happened
to
be
a
municipal
line
is
part
of
the
cost
of
the
project
or
is
carried
as
the
city's
share,
i
guess
the
city's
share
of
the
total
project
cost.
so
there
should
not
be
any
uncertainty
about
the
fact
that
this
case
from
the
beginning
has
involved
claims
for
the
relocation,
for
moving
the
lines
in
the
only
sense
in
which
the
vicinities
of
most
displaced
persons
which
happen
to
use
heavy
or
large
equipment
and
structures
which
are
not
part
of
the
land
taken
because
they
are
severed
from
it
by
agreement
or
by
law.
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
determined
it,
these
were
severed
by
law.
they
were
personal
property.
since
they
are
not
taken,
then
the
expense
of
moving
them,
relocating
them
would
be
one
of
those
inequitable
expenses
and
burdens
borne
by
a
particular
class
of
people
instead
of
being
borne--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--they
were
moved
in
the
sense
in
which
that
term
is
most
frequently
moved
in
the
same
sense
in
which
it
is
used...
if
the
hardware
store
referred
to
in
mr.
crenshaw's
brief
had
been
the
property
of
the
hardware
store
owner
severed
from
the
land
by
agreement
and
he
had
a
right
to
move
it
or
if
some
structure
that
was
part
of
it
he
had
a
right
to
move
from
the
land,
it
did
not
belong
to
the
owner
of
the
land.
it
was
taken.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
two
manholes,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
there
used
to
be
one?
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
no,
your
honor.
the
facilities
that
were
moved
were
simply
duplicated
by
construction
in
a
new
place.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
the
manholes
were
not
dug
out
of
the
ground
and
lifted
and
transferred
to
another
place.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
there
was
no
physical
movement
of
them
from
one
spot
to
another.
i
submit
that
the
language
of
the
act
when
it
refers
to
moving
personal
property
has
to
apply
if
the
act
is
to
be
intelligible
at
all,
for
instance,
to
this
same
hardware
store
operator's
store
cases,
show
cases,
other
trade
fixtures
which
he
has
a
right
to
move
but
which
it
is
not
sensible,
not
economically
feasible
for
him
to
move
bodily
to
the
new
place.
but
no
one
would
doubt
that
he
has
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
moved
those
structures
and
facilities
when
he
takes
them
down
and
scraps
or
abandons
them
when
it
is
not
practical
to
move
them
bodily
and
rebuilds
and
reconstructs
them
in
a
new
place.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
i
am
so
sorry,
your
honor.
i
could
not
hear.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
by
moving
personal
property?
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
the
fact
that
in
common
acceptation
when
one
of
the
tower
lines
constructed
on
one
man's
land
in
sight
of
us
all
is
taken
down
and
rebuilt
on
another
man's
land,
the
whole
world
would
say
the
company
has
moved
its
power
line.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
yes,
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
you
would
still...
we
would
all
still
say
the
company
has
moved
its
power
line.
now
we
should
not
from
that
proceed
to
the
assumption
that
a
statute
authorizing
payment
for
the
cost
of
moving
that
line
would
entitle
anyone
to
be
paid
for
building
himself
a
new
line
the
whole
cost
of
that
which
might
be
a
much
bigger,
better
and
newer
line
than
the
old
one,
and
that
is
not
the
cost
that
was
claimed
here.
it
is
not
the
cost
that
all
utility
companies
have
always
claimed
when
they
were
entitled,
admittedly
entitled
to
claim
the
nonbetterment
cost
of
moving.
you
start
with
the
cost
of
the
new
construction.
you
must
deduct
from
it
the
unused
value,
any
difference
in
value
between
the
new
line
and
the
value
of
the
old
one
that
they
gave
up.
you
do
not
get
the
benefit
of
new
construction.
our
claims
do
not
claim
it.
under
our
interpretation
of
the
act
the
displaced
person
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
new
construction.
he
gets
the
cost
of
replacing
what
cannot
be
moved.
it
is
not
part
of
his
cost
of
just
moving
if
he
builds
a
better
one.
that
is
the
cost
of
an
improvement
which
he
cannot
claim
and
should
not
received.
but
he
has
moved
any
shared
structure
of
any
kind
which
he
had
a
right
to
take.
it
was
not
taken
with
the
land
because
it
belonged
to
someone
else.
that
is
why
it
was
personal
property.
he
did
not
take
it
with
him
to
the
new
land,
but
if--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--it
comes
under
(a)(1),
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
that
is
what,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
no,
the
figure
representing
that
loss
appears
in
these
claims
in
only
one
indirect
way.
when
you
determine
what
was
the
cost
of
relocating
this
utility
line
from
the
old
land
it
used
to
be
on
to
the
land
it
is
on
now,
you
start
with
the
cost
of
building
the
new
line.
you
deduct
from
that
the
difference
between
the
value
of
that
new
line
and
the
old
one
that
you
gave
up.
you
must
deduct
also
the
salvage
value
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--because,
your
honor,
we
would...
the
same
statement...
these
same
claims
although
we
do
argue
and
it
is
still
our
position
that
they
are
the
cost
of
moving
these
utility
lines
the
same
thing
is
also--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--i
beg
your
pardon,
the
expense
of
moving
the
lines.
it
is
not
only
the
expense
of
moving
the
lines.
it
is
equally
as
true
that
those
same
expenses
or
the
expense
of
moving
a
business--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--if
that
view
of
the
expense
of
moving
personal
property
were
accepted
which
we
still
contest,
if
that
were
accepted
the
same
figures
still
represent
the
expense
of
moving
a
business
which
is
defined
in
the
statute
very
carefully
so
as
to
mean
any
legitimate
activity
of
business
cannot
be
physically
moved.
it
is
an
activity.
it
is
not
a
thing
physically.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
4601,
subparagraph
7.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
it
is
in
the
opening
pages
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.
it
is
4601
(7),
and
it
is
in
this
instance
every
expense
claimed
was
also
we
think
it
was
an
expense
of
moving
a
utility
line.
whether
it
was
or
not
is
was
a
sure
expense
of
moving
the
lawful
activity
of
using
these
lines
from
the
land
where
they
used
to
be
used
to
serve
the
public.
that
is
what
senator
caplan
defines
as
the
meaning
of
the
word
"business"
wherever
used
in
the
act.
it
was
most
assuredly
the
cost
of
moving
that
business
activity--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
not
all
of
that
section,
but
that
is
the
act
of
business
that
we
moved.
then
4622(a)
provides
that
payment
shall
be
made
for
the
cost
not
only
of
moving
personal
property...
in
this
case
it
happened
to
be
the
same
thing...
it
is
the
cost
of
moving
a
business
which
is
that
lawful
activity
that
we
were
conducting
on
that
property
and
also
for
the
cost
of
just
moving.
in
the
case
of
any
business
organization
the
business
corporation,
partnership
or
association
cannot
physically
move.
it
has
no
physical
existence.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
they
have
not
considered
these
questions
except
to
the
extent
that
they
are
necessarily
included
in
the
legal
conclusion
that
a
company
in
moving
its
facilities
has
moved
or
at
least
has
moved
its
business
or
has
moved
its
personal
property
from
one
place
to
another.
we
think
it
moved
all
three.
it
has
not
considered
them
directly
because
the
contention
that
we
have
not
moved
our
facilities
was
never
made
in
the
lower
court
or
in
any
of
the
administrative
proceedings
and
were
stipulated
by
the
parties
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
we
did
move
all
of
our
facilities,
admitted
in
the
answer
that
we
did
move
all
of
our
facilities,
stipulated
that
we
did
move
all
of
our
facilities,
stipulation
agreed
to
by
all
the
parties.
the
significance
of
that
fact...
i
do
not
contend
that
the
parties,
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
bound
themselves
by
the
legal
conclusions
involved
in
the
use
of
those
terms.
it
is
highly
significant,
though,
to
my
contention
that
that
is
the
usual
and
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
word
"moved
its
facilities"
when
we
are
dealing
with
any
displaced
person
whose
facilities,
whose
personal
property
includes
property
of
such
physical
nature
that
it
needs
to
be
rebuilt
in
a
new
place.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
they
did
not
mention--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--the
removal
of
personal
property
although
they
plainly
regarded
that
the
reconstruction
of
these
lines
amounted
to
moving
the
lines.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
they
bear
fully
understood--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--it
was
never
discussed.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
that
point
is
indeed
argued
in
the
reply
briefs.
the
courts
below
did
not
consider
any
of
these
contentions
now
being
made
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
expression
"moved"
in
the
case
of
a
corporation,
moved
from
land,
moved
personal
property
from
land
when
in
fact
it
had
to
be
rebuilt
elsewhere.
it
did
not
consider
any
of
those
because
made
for
the
first
time
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits
never
once
advanced
before
and
the
court
will
review
the
pleadings,
the
stipulations.
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
we
were
all
agreed
then
that
the
utility
company
here,
the
telephone
company,
had
moved
its
lines
to
the
new
places,
moved
all
of
its
facilities
to
the
new
places
stipulated
in
so
many
words
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
--that
is
the
one
thing
they
did
not.
the
answers
denied
although
the
government
did
not
agree
with
this,
that
is,
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
in
the
administrative
review
disagreed.
they
contended
that
we
did
not
move
as
a
result
of
the
acquisition.
but
they
admitted
that
the
removal
of
all
of
these
facilities
occurred.
that
is
expressly
admitted
in
the
answers,
alleged
in
the
complaint,
admitted
in
the
answers
and
stipulated
in
the
stipulation
of
facts.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
i
think
the
testimony
makes
clear
that
the
manholes
were
abandoned
and
left
in
the
ground.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
in
the
same
sense
in
which
we
say
they
rented
the
building.
the
shed
which
one
company
has
rented
and
used
for
years
to
store
machinery
on
the
land
of
another
after
which
rebuilds
on
a
new
place
we
all
say
the
company
has
moved
its
shed
to
the
new
place.
mr.
joseph
l.
kelly
it
is
indeed
possible
and
under
this
view
of
what
is
meant
by
"moved"
the
utility
companies
and
all
other
displaced
companies
including
the
chainsaw
company
involved
in
the
beaird-poulan
case
discussed
where
they
moved
plant.
they
did
not
pick
that
plant
up
and
move
it,
your
honor.
they
did
not
pick
much
up
and
move
it.
they
moved
a
whole
plant,
and
the
court
concluded
that
the
beaird-poulan
moved.
it
is
also
the
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
maybe
you
have
to
move
your
entire
business.
the
chain
saw
plant
was
most
assuredly
not
the
only
business
of
the
emerson
company.
that
is
why
the
statute
was
so
careful
to
define
what
activity
is,
what
a
business
means.
it
means
any
activity
conducted
for
a
business
purpose.
that
activity
was
moved.
whether
we
all
could
agree
that
the
company
moved
that
is
what
everyone
would
say
in
common
parlance
and
that
the
power
line
was
moved,
the
underground
lines
were
moved,
that
is
what
everyone
would
say
in
common
parlance.
we
say
that
is
what
the
act
meant.
whether
we
could
all
agree
on
that
or
not,
most
assuredly
the
activity
was
moved
to
the
new
location.
i
trust
the
court
understands
that
from
the
time
when
the
claims
were
first
filed
right
through...
i
cannot
recall
how
many
years
of
administrative
consideration
of
those
claims...
two
years
in
the
trial
court,
a
total
of
three
years
in
litigation,
the
parties
seem
to
be
fully
agreed
that
we
had
moved
the
lines
and
that
we
had
moved.
there
was
never
any
contention
to
the
contrary
ever
asserted.
that
continued
to
be
true
down
through
the
time
when
the
government's
first
brief
was
filed.
having
declined
to
join
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
error,
the
government's
position
was
not
quite
fully
stated
just
now
by
the
solicitor
general.
the
statement
there
twice
was
that
the
plain
terms
of
the
act
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
merely
followed
the
plain
terms
of
the
act.
nothing
has
happened.
at
that
point
the
department
of
justice
had
been
defending
this
litigation
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
for
more
than
three
years.
it
has
in
the
trial
court
supported
the
administrative
interpretation
until
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
plain
terms
of
the
act
after
which
the
solicitor
general
concluded
and
informed
the
court
in
its
brief
in
opposition
that
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
be
said
to
have
erred
in
following
the
plain
language
of
the
act
and
that
the
arguments
to
the
contrary
of
the
petitioner
and
amicus
supporting
the
petitioner
were
made
despite
the
act's
plain
terms.
nothing
has
been
said
to
explain
how
in
the
next
five
months
the
act's
plain
terms
became
any
less
plain.
i
think
attention
should
be
called
to
the
anomalous
consequences
that
would
arise
out
of
any
interpretation
of
the
word
"move
personal
property"
in
this
or
move
property
that
would
limit
it
to
the
case
when
it
can
be
bodily
transplanted.
the
law
was
never
intended
to
treat
differently
the
power
company,
the
gas
company
that
takes
up
his
lines
and
moves
them
and
uses
them
again
and
the
one
where
it
is
not
feasible
and
not

that
and
puts
new
ones
in
the
new
place
and
recovers
compensation
only
for
the
difference
between
the
old

the
new

the

the
actual
cost
of
putting

back
where
it
