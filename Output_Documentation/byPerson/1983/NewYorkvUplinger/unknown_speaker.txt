unknown
speaker
you
are
not
speaking
for
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
though?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
know
you
do,
but
he--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
the
authority
to
represent...
you
can't
speak
for
the
state
of
new
york,
can
you?
can't
you
just
speak
for
the
county
or
what?
unknown
speaker
for
the
state,
because
you
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but,
only
he
has
to
run
for
election.
unknown
speaker
but
not
statewide.
unknown
speaker
mr.
arcara,
do
you
have
some
state
requirement
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
be
vouched
in
whenever
their
is
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
new
york
statute?
unknown
speaker
no.
my
question
was...
some
states
have
statutes
which
provide
that
in
any
action
in
the
state,
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
is
raised,
then
the
parties
must
vouch
the
attorney
general
into
the
case
to
let
him
come
in
and
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
are
you
required
to
give
him
notice?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
required
to
if
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
is
at
stake
and
then
he
has
the
option.
unknown
speaker
so,
after
he
got
the
notice,
he
never
told
you
he
was
going
to
appear
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
interpreting
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
we
may
read
the
opinion
in
this
case
in
the
light
of
its
onofre
opinion?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
dissenting
judge
think
they
acted
on?
unknown
speaker
okay.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
deal
with...
denied
it
was
placing
its
decision
on
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
vagueness
because
your
opposition
has
said
the
statute
is
vague?
unknown
speaker
not
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was?
unknown
speaker
because
as
the
respondent
they
have
raised
vagueness
and
on
that
ground
they
urge
it
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
or
the
appellee
or
whatever
you
are.
respondent.
unknown
speaker
based
on
the
united
states
constitution?
unknown
speaker
then
what
was
the
case
adjudicated
on?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
onofre?
how
about
onofre?
unknown
speaker
right.
and,
here
they
relied
on
onofre?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
a
person
on
the
street
in
a
public
place
solicits
two
people
engage
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy
or
act
of
sodomy
and
both
of
them
say,
please
leave
me
alone,
you
are
annoying
me,
and
they
immediately
call
a
policeman
and
say
this
man
is
soliciting
me
contrary
to
the
statute.
now,
on
what
ground
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
you
say
that
that
person
could
not
be
convicted?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
saying
you
couldn't
be
convicted
under
the
statute
even
if
you
were
annoying
people
by
your
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
whether
you
could
be
convicted
under
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
can
see
that
perhaps...
suppose
the
person
first
solicited,
a
person
who
says,
please
leave
me
along,
you
are
annoying
me,
and
refused.
he
solicits
another
person
who
is
very
willing.
he
is
then
charged
with
two
counts
of
illegal
solicitation
under
this
statute.
now,
could
he
be
convicted
under
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion?
could
he
be
convicted
on
either
one
or
both?
unknown
speaker
on
either
count?
unknown
speaker
then
i
can't
believe
that
you
say
this
is
a
constitutional
decision.
all
you
are
saying
is
that...
in
my
example,
you
are
just
saying,
well,
neither
of
those
acts
under
either
of
those
counts
is
covered
by
the
statute.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
just
construed
the
statute
not
to
cover
either
one
of
them,
and
yet
you
say
this
is
a
constitutionally-based
decision.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
it
can't
be
both
ways.
i
don't
blame
you
for
arguing
this
is
just
a
case
of
statutory
construction,
but
i
thought
you
said
that...
i
certainly
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
having
a
constitutional
issue
in
it.
well,
i
thought
counsel
did
too.
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
have
to
reach
a
constitutional
issue
if
it
just
construed
the
statute
not
to
cover
either
one
of
the
situations
that
i
outlined
in
those
two
counts?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
private,
but
can
you
imagine
holding
that
when
he
solicited
an
undercover
police
officer
that
it
was
sort
of
a
consensual
matter?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
can
just
take
his
chances,
solicit
anybody
he
wants
to
as
long
as
he
doesn't
know.
he
isn't
annoying
anybody
just
by
soliciting
anybody
on
the
street?
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
is
an
overbreadth
argument,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
necessary,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
how
would
that
case
ever
come
up
if
no
one
is
around
and
they
both
consenting?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
a
hypothetical
that
can't
occur.
unknown
speaker
in
public.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
the
statute
is
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
your
submission
has
to
include,
i
suppose,
that
a
person
must,
when
he
is
walking
down
the
street,
put
up
with
people
accosting
him
or
her
for
deviate
sexual
purposes?
unknown
speaker
well,--
--that
is
just
about
what
you
said
a
minute
ago.
do
you
think
the...
the
solicitation
may
be
very
private,
very
quiet,
very
polite,
but
nevertheless
there
is
a
person
walking
down
the
street
who
doesn't
care
to
be
solicited
for
a
deviate
sexual
purpose
and
is
very
annoyed
by
it.
now,
may
the
state
forbid
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
forbid
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
it
is
illegal...
you
have
committed
a
criminal
act
if
you
solicit
a
person
on
the
street
and
he
turns
you
down?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
so,
anyone
must
put
up
with
being
solicited
on
the
street?
unknown
speaker
the
person
who
is
solicited
is
the
one
who
is
most
offended.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
fine,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
person
who
turns
him
down
and
he
is
very
annoyed
by
it.
can
the
man
then
be
convicted
for
annoying
this
other
person?
unknown
speaker
well,
an
element
of
harassment...
he
says
i
am
harassed,
i
don't
like
to
be
walking
down
the
street
and
be
accosted
by
a
homosexual.
unknown
speaker
well,
solicitated
by
a
homosexual.
unknown
speaker
he
came
up
to
me
very
politely,
very
politely
and
said,
would
you
like
to
come
over
to
my
house?
now,
i
take
it
you
say
the
state
may
not
forbid
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
it
forbid
exactly
what
i
said?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
state
could
say
it
is
illegal
to
solicit
anybody...
you
have
committed
a
criminal
act
if
you
have
solicited
somebody
who
turns
you
down?
unknown
speaker
or
who
turns
you
down
and
is
annoyed.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
a
fellow
comes
up
and
says
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions,
is
he
off
the
hook
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
an
overbreadth
argument
certainly
didn't
have
much
of
an
impact.
unknown
speaker
either
implicitly
or
overtly.
unknown
speaker
although
the
dissent
said
that
they
were
really,
in
effect,
applying
overbreadth
and
the
majority
the
dissent
couldn't
be
more
misguided.
unknown
speaker
but,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
discussion.
it
said
antecedent--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
it
certainly
didn't
use
the
term
discussion
which
might
have
lent
some
support
to
the
idea
that
it
was
a
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
can
the
state
ban
a
prostitute
of
either
sex
from
soliciting
intercourse
in
public
or
soliciting
money
for
intercourse
i
should
say?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make
what
the
motivations
were
or
what
triggered
the
prostitution
program?
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gardner,
how
do
you
present
your
issues?
how
do
you
make
what
clear
what
issues
you
are
presenting
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals?
in
your
briefs
or
do
you
file
a
paper
initially
petitioning
for
review?
unknown
speaker
right.
and
do
you
state
your
grounds?
unknown
speaker
so
the
grounds
are
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
and
is
your
new
york
court
of
appeals
brief
in
the
record
here,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
did
the
rules
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
require
the
parties
to
state
what
is
the
question
presented
on
the
first
page,
as
we
do
here?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
they
say
the
question
was?
how
did
they
define--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
is
it
set
out
as
we
do
here?
unknown
speaker
it
might
help
the
court
find
out
what
they
are
deciding.
unknown
speaker
you're
defending
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
ground
that
they
didn't
rely
on.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
