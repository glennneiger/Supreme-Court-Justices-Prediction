justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
arcara,
that
may
be
true,
but
apparently
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
placed
the
construction
on
the
purpose
of
this
statute
that
was
more
limited
than
that
said
that
it
was
not
a
statute
intended
to
protect
the
harassment
of
other
people
in
the
vicinity,
but
rather
was
in
the
nature
of
the
companion
attempt
statute
to
another
law
which
new
york,
of
course,
had
held
unconstitutional.
are
we
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
state
court
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
dealt
with
it
incorrectly
and
that
is
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
gave...
spelled
out
what
it
said
the
purpose
was
and
was
not.
are
we
bound
by
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
denied
cert
on
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
possibly
the
court
based
it
on
either
the
right
of
privacy
inquiry
or
possibly
a
first
amendment
problem,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
arcara,
i
still
don't
understand
why
we
are
talking
about
overbreadth
in
view
of
the
court
of
appeals'
clear
statement
that
it
wasn't
basing
its
decision
on
that.
and,
i
assumed
we
were
here
to
review
their
decision.
now,
for
purposes
of
your
argument,
do
you
assume
that
there
is
a
right
of
privacy
as
articulated
in
onofre?
do
you
make
that
assumption
and
nevertheless
urge
that
this
statute
need
not
be
held
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
the
merits
of
the
onofre
case
were
not
briefed
here
in
this
court
or
argument
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--right.
so,
that
really,
i
assume,
wasn't
before
us.
you
were
assuming
somehow
that
onofre
was
correct
and
there
was
the
right
found
in
that
court
of
privacy,
but
that
this
statute,
the
attempt
statute,
if
you
will,
was
nevertheless
valid,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
apparently
the
majority
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
did
not
view
the
legislative
purpose
to
be
the
deterrence
of
harassment,
but,
nonetheless,
i
suppose
you
would
perhaps
say
that
this
statute
that
we
are
looking
at
was
an
effort
to
control
certain
public
conduct
rather
than
conduct
in
private.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gardner,
assuming
that
that
is
correct
and
we
shouldn't
address
the
correctness
of
the
onofre
decision,
nevertheless,
if
there
is
any
right,
as
recognized
in
onofre,
and
assuming
for
this
purpose
that
there
is,
does
that
right
extent
to
prohibiting
the
state
from
controlling
attempts
made
in
public?
and,
why
should
the
right
to
privacy
to
do
things
in
private
extend
on
to
do
the
same
or
some
portion
of
those
things
in
public?
that
is
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
statute
does
exactly
that
as
i
understand
it.
that
is
precisely
what
this
statute
does
and
you
have
two
respondents
here,
one
of
which
apparently
was
involved
in
a
heterosexual
solicitation
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
statute
does.
