mr.
william
h.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
agree
with
my
opponent
that
this
was
a
constitutional
adjudication
below.
i
don't
believe
that
needs
to
be
proved,
but
if
there
is
any
need
for
proof
of
it,
one
only
need
look
at
the
record.
the
only
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
lower
courts
and
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
constitutional
challenge.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
it
was
based...
the
challenge
was
based
on
both
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
state
constitution.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
one
can't
determine
that
by
looking
at
the
uplinger
decision
by
itself.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
the
onofre
decision
was
adjudicated
solely
under
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
yes,
that
is
what
they
said
in
their
decision.
and,
i
have
no
doubt,
therefore,
that
they
made
this
adjudication
under
the
federal
constitution
as
well.
i
think
that
some
of
the
problems
we
have
procedurally
at
this
point
is
that
both
counsel
for
both
parties
have
some
difficulty,
as
i
am
sure
the
court
does,
in
the
brief
opinion
that
was
written
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
knowing
exactly
what
they
were
saying.
however,
there
were
some
things
that
they
were
saying
that
come
through
very
clearly
and
while
that
has
been
mentioned
briefly,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
state
is
asking
this
court
to
go
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
i
might
also
say
that
the
state
has
varied
its
position
with
regard
to
whether
the
court
below
construed
the
statute
or
not.
if
you
will
look
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
page
six
you
will
find
the
following
quotation:
the
state
argued
there
that
the
statute,
and
i
am
quoting,
"contrary
to
the
conclusion
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
not
limited
just
to
consensual
sodomy
anticipatory
conduct.
"
in
other
words,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
were
saying
what
i
say
which
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
construe
the
statute.
when
they
got
into
the
main
brief,
they
were
saying
somewhat
the
same
thing
as
i
indicate
in
my
responding
brief,
and
then
when
they
got
to
the
reply
brief,
as
a
result,
i
believe,
of
my
having
raised
the
issue
in
point
two
of
my
brief.
they
come
up
with
the
concept
that
i
am
not
certain
i
fully
understand
that
is
based
upon,
i
believe,
a
misreading
of
the
decision
ward
and
gaugh
versus
krinsky.
they
suggest
in
the
reply
brief
by
a
quotation
from
that
case
that
this
court,
while
it
may
be
bound
by
a
construction
of
state
statute,
is
not
bound
by
the
reasoning
in
reaching
the
decision
that
this
court
reaches,
and
then
they
state
in
their
brief
that,
therefore,
if
the
legislature's
intent
was
different
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was,
that
this
court
is
not
bound
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
would
say
that
the
ground
would
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
construed
the
statute
as
being
limited
to
a
smaller...
if
i
may
use
the
word
"geographical"
area...
than
what
you
are
talking
about.
it
was
not
designed
to
reach
offensiveness
per
se.
it
was
designed
as
one
of
the
levels
of
inchoacy
behind
the
consensual
sodomy
statute.
behind
the
consensual
sodomy
statute
originally
you
had--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--well,
your
honor,
i
haven't--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
haven't
thought
that
through,
i
am
not
sure,
but
you
could
be
convicted
under
another
statute
which
is
the
harassment
statute.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
if
you
take
the
construction
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
believe
that
the
way
this
statute
is
written
and
the
way
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
construed
it
he
would
not
be
convicted
under
this
particular
statute
at
the
present
time.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
on
either
count.
however,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
made
it
clear
that
that
kind
of
conduct
could
be
subject
to
conviction.
i
cite
the
phipps
versus
ohio
case
as
an
example
the
kind
of
fact
pattern,
your
honor,
that
you
have
cited.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
what
i
have
said
is
this--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
don't
believe...
first
of
all,
i
am
convinced
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
a
constitutional
adjudication.
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--well,
because,
your
honor,
it
was
faced
with
a
fact
pattern
that
is
totally
different
from
what
you
were
talking
about.
it
was
faced
with
a
fact
pattern
of
an
individual
who
extended
a
private
invitation
to
go
to
his
home
and
engage
in--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
don't
think
that
the
determination
of
the
consensual
matter
can
be
judged
on
the
identity
of
the
police
officer
which
was
not
known
to
the
respondent
at
that
time.
it
has
to
be
gaged
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
the
role
the
police
officer
was
playing.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
i
say
at
all
and
that
is
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
what
the
people
are
saying
is
that
there
is
a
per
se
absolute
prohibition
which
is
constitutionally
permissible
that
no
man
or
woman
can
ever
have
this
kind
of
a
conversation
with
any
other
person
anywhere
in
the
state
of
new
york
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
believe
that
overbreadth
is
necessary
here
and
i
don't
understand--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
understand.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
the
state
makes
the
claim,
your
honor,
that
it
can't
be
done
in
public
under
any
circumstances
except
in
what
it
says
is
a
limited
circumstance,
if
two
people
were
in
a
remote
place
and
no
one
else
was
around,
which,
i
submit,
is
the
general
situation,
in
these
kinds
of
situations,
as
pointed
out
in
the
ucla
law
review
article
cited
in
a
couple
of
the
amicus
briefs.
i
think
that
the
problem
that
we
are
facing
here
has
to
do
with
the
kind
of
characterization
that
the
state
gives
the
court,
the
thought
that
homosexuals
have
taken
over
this
particular
area
or
what-have-you.
the
fact
is
if
two
homosexuals
had
met...
first
of
all,
that
is
not
true,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
if
two
homosexuals
had
met
each
other
and
had
a
private
conversation
in
that
particular
area
with
no
one
around
who
could
hear
anything,
under
the
state's
analysis,
the
problem
they
are
facing
is
that
he
sees
it
that
they
have
taken
over.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
it
would
only
come
up--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--it
would
only
come
up
in
the
way
that
this
case
has
come
up,
through
an
undercover
police
officer,
which
is
another
way
of
indicating
that
the
only
way
that
you
have
offensiveness
in
the
typical
situation
is
where
somebody
has
blatantly
posed
the
question
right
up
front
at
the
very
beginning
and
has
not,
through
a
process
of
acquaintanceship,
become
attuned
to
the
fact
that
the
other
person
is
receptive
to
the
conversation
that
is
going
to
occur.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
am
not
sure
that
they
said
this
prohibits
the
solicitation.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
all
right.
i
was
only
going
to
draw
the
point
that
it
is
a
loitering
statute.
i
didn't
recall
that
they
claimed
that
it
was
a
solicitation
statute.
but,
what
is
clear
is
that
it
is
an
inchoate
invitation
to
engage
in
an
act
of
conduct
in
a
private
place
which
was
not
illegal.
and,
the
question
i
think
they
were
facing
is--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
illegal
after
the
onofre
decision,
as
a
matter
of
adjudication
in
that
case,
whatever
the
rule
may
be
in
this
court's
opinion
with
regard
to
the
correctness
of
that
case.
i
don't
believe
you
need
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
would
agree
that
you
have
that
power.
what
i
would
say
is
that
it
may
not
be
appropriate
to
do
it
under
the
circumstances
that
you
are
presented
with
in
this
case.
i
have
referred
to
the
gates
decision
in
my
brief
and
i
submit
that
that
should
be
reviewed
and
thought
about.
the
one
thing
that
i
would
emphasize,
please,
is
that
we
do
not
have
a
record
here
that
would
give
your
honor
and
the
court
sufficient
information
to
make
the
kind
of
judgments
and
evaluations
as
to
whether
the
onofre
decision
was
correct
in
terms
of
the
social
impact,
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
participation
in
the
kinds
of
sexual
activities
that
we
are
talking
about,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
right
of
sexual
privacy
that
onofre
talked
about
is
the
right
that
protects
my
client
in
terms
of
his
conversation
with
someone
else
in
a
public
place.
i
believe
that
the
right
we
are
dealing
with
here
falls
under
the
rubric
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
subject
to
all
the
power
of
regulation
that
is
appropriate
under
that
particular
amendment.
there
has
been
suggestions
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
the
right
of
sexual
privacy
may
be
impaired
or
burdened
in
some
way
if
the
court
does
not
allow
some
very
limited
controlled
public
conversation
about
the
private
right.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
if
you
limit
it,
if
you
balance
the
interest
as
between
the
right
of
the
speaker
to
speak
and
the
right
of
the
hearer
to
have
an
acceptable
environment,
as
justice
stevens
indicated
in
the
bolger
case
last
year.
if
you
balance
those
interests
in
the
area
of
sex,
it
is
going
to
be
obvious
that
any
exercise
of
the
right
of
free
speech
is
going
to
have
to
be
subject
to
consideration
for
the
acceptability
of
the
that
speech
to
the
person
you
are
speaking
to,
consideration
for
the
sensitivity
of
the
public
at
large.
i
would
only
point
out
to
you
that
what
the
state
wants
to
say
is
that
you
can't
talk
about
it
at
all,
you
can't
discuss
this
subject
if
it
includes
and
invitation
to
come
home.
i
am
saying
that
this
court
has
never--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--in
public.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
it
says
in
public,
your
honor,
but
a
conversation
between
two
people
on
a
street
with
no
one
within
hearing
distance
at
all,
i
submit,
is
still
a
private
conversation,
just
as
the
telephone
conversation
in
a
public
place
in
katz
was
a
private--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--absolutely
not,
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
the
state
may
forbid
it.
and,
in
the
hearing--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--the
state
may
forbid
it
by,
in
effect,
adopting
the
kind
of
a
statute
which
was
approved
in
commonwealth
versus
sefranka
and
in
pryor,
the
california
decision,
which
i
cite
in
my
brief.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
what
you
can
say
is--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--no,
no.
the
result--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--no,
your
honor.
in
commonwealth
versus
sefranka...
i
refer
you
to
that
case...
and
in
the
pryor
decision,
what
the
court
said
was
that
you
could
not
be
convicted
unless
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
or
some
indication
that
there
was
someone
present
who
would
be
offended
thereby.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
but,
let
me
pose
these
facts,
if
i
may.
suppose
i
meet
an
individual
and
we
have
a
discussion
for
30
minutes,
45
minutes,
whatever,
and
it
quickly
becomes
apparent
that
we
are
both
homosexuals
and
that
he
is
interested
and,
therefore,
i
extend
an
invitation.
how
can
there
be
offense?
mr.
william
h.
gardner
he
can
if
there
was
an
element
harassment
or
if
there
was
an
element
of
recklessness.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
the
word
"accosted"
and
the
word--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--if
there
is--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
say
that
the
state
may
not
pass
a
law
which
blanketly
forbids
it
in
all
circumstances
without
regard
to--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--yes,
it
may,
if
it
is
a
narrowly
drawn
statute.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
no,
no,
no.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
no,
it
is
not
the
result
of
the
individual.
it
is
illegal
for
you
to
solicit
somebody,
if,
under
the
circumstances,
you
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
be
consensual
towards
that
kind
of
a
solicitation
in
terms
of
receiving
the
information.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
think
it
is
a
factual
question
in
every
case,
your
honor.
we
can
pose
hypotheticals,
but
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
you
can
blanketly
proscribe
speech
without
requiring
that
there
be
some--
--it
is
a
state
overbreadth
argument?
it
may
be.
i
would
point
out
in
that
connection,
someone
asked
the
district
attorney
what
he
was
doing,
whether
he
was
just
responding
to
our
arguments
in
that
regard.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
brief,
you
will
see
that
the
district
attorney,
and
i
don't
fault
him
for
this,
has
argued
association,
overbreadth,
under
inclusiveness
and
vagueness
in
his
original
brief
to
the
court.
on
the
basis
that
those
issues
were
submitted
to
the
court
below
and
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
they
had
an
impact
on
the
decision
below
or
whether
they
would
be
before
this--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--i
think
that
the
argument
i
make--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--we
have
to
go
back
one
step,
if
i
may.
we
have
to
go
back
to
determine
what
it
was
the
court
was
doing.
i
submit
to
you
that
what
the
court
below
was
doing
was
saying
that
the
ultimate
act
had
been
converted
into
a
legal
constitutionally
protected
act
and
that,
therefore,
you
couldn't
forbid
discussion
about
that
act.
now,
what
we
do
not
know
is
whether
their
statement
to
that
effect
is
a
first
amendment
speech
statement
or
whether
it
is
an
extension
of
the
privacy
concept.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
solicitation.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
the
whole
case
was
about
solicitation.
the
court
of
appeals
was
dealing
with
an
actual
solicitation.
we
don't
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
or
whether
they
were
thinking
in
first
amendment
terms
because
they
didn't
express
it.
what
they
did
say
was
that
since
the
ultimate
act
was
not
criminal,
you
can't
punish
the
discreet
invitation
for
that
act.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
yes,
i
believe
they
can.
i
believe
that
when
you
get
into
commercial
sex,
that
is
a
different
area.
i
am
not
arguing
that
prostitution
is
constitutionally
protected
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
you
have
the
sample
principle,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
quite
apart
from
whether
they
could
effectively
do
it
or
not,
the
fact
is
that
they
do
not
attempt
to
ban
solicitation
of
heterosexual
sex
unless
it
is
harassing.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
that
gets
into
the
area
of
the
discrimination
argument,
your
honor.
we
started
out...
if
you
look
at
the
trial
court
memorandum
and
opinion,
it
says
that
they
only
started
going
after
the
prostitutes
after
onofre
was
decided.
although
the
statute
is
broadly
written
and
could
theoretically
apply
to
any
heterosexual
sex,
it
is
not
applied
to
anyone
else
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
well,
it
has
to
do
with
the
underinclusiveness
and
denial
of
equal
protection
argument
which
i
made
in
my
brief.
but,
on
this
particular
point,
with
justice
rehnquist
inquiry,
my
response
is
the
same.
the
state
could
prohibit
public
solicitation
in
a
singles
bar
or
elsewhere
in
heterosexual
situations.
put
aside
the
commercial
aspect.
i
think
that
is
a
different
question.
if
you
had
a
situation
either
where
the
individual
was
coming
up
announced
blantantly
to
somebody
and
issuing
an
invitation
in
what
would
have
to
be
a
harassing
situation
under
the
facts,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
could
extend
it
to
the
point
of
two
acquaintances,
for
example,
who
happen
to
be
sitting
in
a
bar
and
one
invited
the
other
to
go
home
for
consensual
sex.
again,
you
get
to
the
point
that
there
must
be
some
type,
when
you're
not
dealing
with
ultimate
criminal
conduct,
you
get
to
some
point
where
there
has
to
be
some
type
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
narrowing
of
the
writing
of
statute
which
is
going
to
restrict
that
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
no,
you
file
the
briefs.
there
is
a
petition.
excuse
me.
there
is
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
you
state
your
grounds
therein.
but
that
does
not
become
a
part
of
the
appeal
record
that
the
case
is
decided
on.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
no.
i
was
told
it
couldn't
properly
go
into
the
record,
but
that
the
court
could
call
for
it
if
it
wished
to
do
so.
and
i
have
summarized
in
my
brief
the
arguments
that
were
raised
and
pointed
to
the
pages
of
the
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals
where
those
arguments
were
raised.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
well,
in
the
opening
of
the
briefs
the
questions
are
stated.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor,
you
have
a
request
for
what
the
issues
are
that
will
be
appealed.
in
our
procedure,
when
you
apply
for
permission
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
you
indicate
what
the
issues
are
that
are
involved
in
this
case
that
make
it
significant.
you
do
not
have
to
specify
what
the
issues
are
specifically
that
will
be
decided.
in
your
brief
that
you
file
with
the
court
of
appeals,
you
indicate
those
questions
in
detail.
if
the
court
calls
for
my
brief,
you
will
see
how
i
have
indicated
those
questions.
i
want
to
get
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
construction
argument.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
once
there
had
been
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
a
narrowing
way
indicating,
in
effect,
that
if
you're
looking
for
the
problem
of
harassment
of
other
people
and
if
you're
looking
for
some
of
those
other
types
of
concerns
that
the
state
talks
about,
the
problem
with
minors
and
things
of
that
sort,
there
are
other
statutes.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
this
statute
doesn't
deal
with
that,
this
statute
is
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
was
involved
in
the
consensual
sodomy
laws,
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
free
to
deal
with
those
other
problems
any
time
they
want
to,
as
long
as
they
write,
to
the
extent
that
it
imposes
free
speech
restrictions,
narrowly,
stated
statutes
that
do
not
undually
impinge
upon
free
communication.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
justice
powell,
i
think
that
what
has
happened--
mr.
william
h.
gardner
--justice
powell,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
defined
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
and
they've
limited
that.
then
they
have
declared
that
statute
as
so
defined
unconstitutional.
the
issue
as
to
whether
it
is
constitutional
as
construed
is
before
this
court.
but
the
court
is
bound
by
the
construction,
which
does
not
encompass
all
of
these
other
concerns
with
regard
to
harassment,
offensiveness,
children,
and
things
of
those
other
types
of
things
that
would
be
very
critical
in
the
correct
case
and
involving
the
correct
statute.
in
the
brief
that
the
state
filed
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of,
i
would
call,
slipperiness
as
to
whether
we're
dealing
with
speech
or
conduct.
when
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
whether
vagueness
has
been
violated,
the
state
tends
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
can
only
be
an
arrest
of
there's
actual
speech,
actual
solicitation.
when
we're
dealing
with
a
situation,
however,
where
i'm
challenging
the
statute
as
being
vague...
correction...
i'm
challenging
the
statute
as
being
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
then
we
talk
about
the
fact
that
it
really
deals
with
conduct.
i
would
respectfully
refer
the
court
and
recommend
the
reading
of
a
case
which
was
published
after
the
briefs
were
filed.
the
name
of
the
case
is
wirtz
versus
risley,
published
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
november
1983.
i
have
a
citation.
the
pocket
part

in
late
december.

second

that
was
a
stature
that
dealt
with
the
question
of
a
threat
and
of
conduct
that
tended
toward
intimidation,
and
the
court
specifically
talked
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
ultimate
act
could
generally
only
be
committed
by
some
type
of
communication
and
therefore
it
tended
toward
pure
speech.
and
therefore,
dealing
with
the
issues
under
the
first
amendment,
dealing
with
the
problem
of
overbreadth
being
thrown
up
as
an
argument
against
the
appellant,
the
court
stated
that:
first,
there
is
pure
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
overbreadth;
and
even
if
we
did,
there
is
substantial
overbreadth
here.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
substantial
overbreadth
here
as
well
because,
although
we
have
specifically
here
facts
in
this
case
regarding
solicitation
on
north
street
in
buffalo,
what
the
state
is
arguing
for
is
a
general
power
to
forbid
any
type
of
sexual
invitation
to
come
home,
even
in
a
gay
bar,
which
is
the
fact
pattern
postulated
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
william
h.
gardner
i
am
responding
to
the...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
first
amendment
free
speech,
although
they
didn't
articulate
it.
and
i'm
anticipating
that
either
my
opponent
or
someone
on
this
court
will
that
i
cannot
argue
that
the
first
amendment
is
involved
beyond
the
narrow
facts
of
my
client's
case
because
case
because
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine.
i
see
the
overbreadth
doctrine
not
as
something
which
i
raise
in
support
of
my
case,
but
which
other
will
raise
against
my
position,
and
i'm
pointing
out
to
you
that
i
do
not
believe
it
applies
in
this
case
in
that
manner.
thank
you
very
much.
