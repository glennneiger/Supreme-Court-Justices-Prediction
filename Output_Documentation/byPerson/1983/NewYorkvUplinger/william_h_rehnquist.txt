justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
arcara,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case?
you
are
the
district
attorney
of
erie
county,
which,
i
guess,
is
buffalo.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
represent
the
state
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
has
apparently
taken
a
partial
fall
in
this
case.
he
has
filed
a
brief
where
he
says,
you
know,
maybe
to
minors,
but...
now,
you
are
speaking
to
the
state
of
new
york
in
this
case,
not
him,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
here
we
are
dealing
with
an
opinion
of
new
york's
highest
court
that
is
a
little
over
a
page
long.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
it
doesn't
cite
any
constitutional
provision.
it
cites
the
penal
law.
unless
one
is
to
go
back
and
look
at
people
versus
onofre,
which
they
refer
to,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
on
what
grounds
they
did
away
with
this
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
don't
you
think
people
against
onofre
sheds
some
light
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
this
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
it
would
have
to,
but
it
doesn't
say
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
only
intimation
i
find
in
the
opinion
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
to
some
constitutional
ground
is
it
says
this
statute,
therefore,
suffers
the
same
deficiencies
as
did
the
consensual
sodomy
statute.
now,
that
takes
you
back
to
onofre
and
there
they
are
talking
about
federal
constitution
rights.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
best
chance
to
get
a
review
of
this
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
court
is
to
agree
that
this
decision
should
be
looked
at
in
the
light
of
onofre.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
assumption
that
onofre
was
correctly
decided
is
contrary
to
our
summary
affirmance
of
the
doe
case
in
1976
from
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gardner--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
agree
with
me
on
my
understanding
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
i
am
about
to
state
to
you
that...
they
say
in
onofre
we
held
that
you
cannot
criminalize
the
act
of
deviate
sexual
intercourse
and
that
is
their
language.
the
statute
under
consideration
in
uplinger
prohibits
solicitation
of
that
sort
of
intercourse.
since
you
can't
criminalize
the
act,
the
state
can't
prohibit
the
solicitation
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
a
quote.
it
is
pretty
close
to
a
quote,
not
quite.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
not
illegal
only
in
the
sense
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
opined
that
the
legislature
can't
make
it
illegal
in
onofre.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
with
you,
because
if
one
of
the
pins
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
its
onofre
decision...
we
obviously
can't
review
onofre,
but
we
can
certainly
review
the
constitutional
law
that
is
laid
down
in
onofre.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
only
one
that
you
can
say
that
might
not
have
had
an
impact,
i
think,
because
the
only
constitutional
doctrine
which
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
is
one
which
it
says
it
didn't
use.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
heterosexual
solicitation
to
get
to
a
question
of
somewhat
different
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
ban
simply
solicitation
on
the
public
streets
of
heterosexual
sex
not
for
money?
