mr.
richard
j.
arcara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
present
cases
are
before
you
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
that
court,
in
a
memorandum
decision
last
year,
found
unconstitutional
new
york
penal
law,
section
235.40,
subdivision
3.
that
statute
is
generally
referred
to
as
the
loitering
statute
in
new
york
and
it
generally
prohibits
individuals
from
loitering
or
remaining
at
a
public
place--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
generally
that
statute
prohibits
individuals
from--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--no,
i
disagree
with
the
attorney
general.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
your
honor,
he
doesn't
have
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
this
law
either.
i
would
also
like
to
point
that
back
out.
i
have
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
this
law
and
i
have
no
knowledge--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--no,
your
honor,
i
am
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
i
have
to
run
also,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and,
by
the
way,
i
might
add
that
i
had
no
knowledge
that
the
attorney
general
was
going
to
file
their
brief
until
the
day
in
which
the
respondents
were
to
file
their
brief.
that
is
the
first
time
that
i
had
any
notice
at
all
that
the
attorney
general
was
going
to
take
this
position,
contrary
to
mine.
in
fact,
he
was
invited
to
participate
in
this
case
at
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
refused.
so,
this
case
came--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--under
the
executive
law,
your
honor,
it
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
appear
in
court
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
your
honor,
he
has
that
option.
he
can
either
appear
to
defend
the--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--we
did
give
him
notice
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
he
has
refrained
from
exercising
that
option
until
the
case
came
before
this
court.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
he
didn't,
your
honor.
i
had
no
knowledge.
this
statute,
generally
referred
to
as
the
loitering
statute,
prohibits
individuals
from
loitering
or
remaining
in
a
public
place
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
or
engaging
in
deviate
sexual
intercourse
or
other
sexual
behavior
of
a
deviate
nature.
now,
briefly
the
fact
underlying
the
two
cases
before
the
court
are
as
follows:
the
respondent
butler,
who
was
a
known
prostitute
by
the
buffalo
police
department,
was
observed
for
approximately
ten
minutes
on
a
public
street
in
the
city
of
buffalo
waving
at
passing
automobiles.
she
ultimately
entered
one
of
those
automobiles
which
then
proceeded
down
a
side
street.
the
police
officer
who
was
making
those
observations
then
went
to
where
that
car
was
parked
and
observed
the
respondent
susan
butler
engaged
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy
with
the
driver
of
that
vehicle.
she
was
then
arrested
under
the
loitering
statute.
mr.
uplinger
was
arrested
on
a
public
street
in
a
quiet
residential
area
of
the
city
of
buffalo
following
a
direct
and
overt
solicitation
to
a
plain
clothes
buffalo
police
officer
to
engage
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy.
the
police
action
in
both
of
these
cases
was
the
result
of
a
reaction
by
the
police
department
to
citizen
complaints
of
these
type
of
activities
occurring
in
those
two
respective
neighborhoods.
i
will
go
into
a
little
more
detail
of
the
facts
of
the
case
during
the
course
of
my
argument.
at
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
represents
a
valid
attempt
by
the
state
to
control
public
order.
our
position
as
the
petitioner
is
that
the
state
enactment
is
valid.
it
is
based
upon
a
legitimate
and
a
compelling
interest
in
the
control
of
the
conduct
that
it
prescribes.
now,
with
regard
to
the
compelling
state
interest,
first
i
submit
that
the
solicitations
we
are
talking
about
here
constitute
a
real
harassment.
they
are
a
real
annoyance
to
a
general
public.
they
are
conversations
of
the
most
intimate
nature.
they
are
the
most
private
of
matters
and
they
are
delivered
in
a
public
form.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
justice
o'connor.
i
dealt
with
that
issue
on
page
four
of
my
reply
brief.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
no
statutory
construction
to
that
statute.
they
merely
invalidated
it
in
toto
and
then
they
gave
some
reasons
for
it
which
i
submit--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
your
honor,
because
the
court,
in
making
its
finding,
relied
upon
the
onofre
decision
and
that
decision
relied
upon
the
right
of
privacy
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
and,
they
interpreted
the
federal
constitution
regarding
the
applicability
of
that
statute
to
the
state
law.
i
submit
that
this
court
is
the
final
arbiter
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
constitution,
as
it
is
applied
to
a
state
court,
was
applied
correctly.
and,
i
submit
they
did
not
apply
it
correctly.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
have
to.
i
think
we
are
talking
about
here
a
public
nuisance
and
i
personally
think
that
the
onofre
decision
was
totally
another
matter.
the
right
of
privacy
they
use
in
that
case...
that
dealt
with
private
acts,
adults
in
a
private
setting.
here
we
are
talking
about
a
harassment
statute
on
a
public
street
in
a
public
area
that
is
annoying
to
the
public
at
large
and
it
is
so
offensive.
i
submit
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
enact
this
law
and
to
protect
the
public
from
these
types
of
infringements
on
their
rights.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
it
is
very
difficult,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
well,
people
versus
onofre
dealt
with
the
right
of
privacy
and
equal
protection.
and,
i
don't
believe
the
right
of
privacy,
the
home,
in
the
private
setting
of
a
home
between
consenting
adults
would
apply
to
the
privacy
that
a
person
is
entitled
to
on
a
public
street.
and,
secondly,
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
don't
think,
has
any
application
here
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
it
would
have
to,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
well,
it
is
very
difficult,
your
honor.
i
wrestled
with
that
decisions
for
many,
many
hours
as
to
what
they
were
trying
to
say.
i
don't
think
they
did
anything
to
try
to
construct
that
statute
in
harmony
with
the
constitution.
they
didn't
look
to
what
the
intent
of
the
law
was.
they
didn't
care
what
the
purpose
of
the
law
was.
they
just
kind,
in
a
summary
fashion,
of
just
said
this
was
an
act
that
was
anticipatory
of
a
legal
act
and,
therefore,
we
are
going
to
cite
it
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
he
thinks
that
they
acted
on
the
overbreadth;
that
they
felt...
justice
jasen
felt
that
the
court
was
applying
the
law
from
the
setting
of
a
private
setting
of
a
home
or
private
residence
to
the
street
and
he
felt
it
was
an
overbroad
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
reference
at
all
to
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
case
at
all,
your
honor.
it
is
strictly
dealt
with
the
right
of
privacy...
well,
in
conjunction
with
the
first
amendment,
i
am
sorry...
and,
as
far
as
the
equal
protection
clause
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
secondly,
these
types
of
solicitations
could
also
lead
to
a
violent
reaction.
and,
beyond
the
fact
that
they
are
forced
upon
an
individual
in
a
public
setting,
they
are
so
intimate
in
nature
that
i
submit
that
a
violent
reaction
could
be
generated
by
a
solicitee
when
some
one
addresses
his
sexuality
in
a
public
street.
i
further
believe
regarding
the
compelling
state
interest
here
that
there
is
a
real
effect
on
minors.
there
is
an
incident
in
the
record...
and
i
make
this
claim
based
upon
what
is
in
the
record...
that
a
mother
was
concerned
about
her
son
being
apprehensive
about
going
out
into
the
street
being
solicited
to
engage
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy.
i
submit
that
there
is
a
potential
harm
when
the
sexuality
of
a
minor
is
addressed
in
a
public
street,
not
with
the
consent
of
the
minor
or
his
parent,
but
strictly
is
to
the
arbitrariness
and
discretion
of
a
pure
stranger.
thirdly,
i
submit
that
this
law
acts
as
a
deterrent
to
those
minors
who
would
solicit,
either
voluntarily
or
through
coercion.
and,
further,
it
prevents
minors
from
being
exploited
by
those
who
would
seek
to
satisfy
their
own
sexual
desires.
lastly
i
submit
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
public
nuisance.
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
businessmen
were
concerned
about
congregating
groups
of
solicitors.
they
believe
that
there
was
a
problem
that
senior
citizens
and
elderly
people
were
somewhat
apprehensive
about
going
into
the
neighborhood
to
the
stores
and
the
to
the
restaurants
that
are
located
in
that
area.
and,
the
citizens
were
apprehensive
about
walking
outside
their
homes
for
fear
of
being
solicited.
what
you
have
in
the
posture
of
this
case
here
is
that
these
individuals
have
taken
over
the
area
of
genesee
street
in
the
city
of
buffalo
and
taking
over
the
area
of
north
street
and
delaware
and
north
street
and
irving
place.
having
set
out
these
compelling
interests
of
the
state,
the
speech
and
the
conduct
we
are
here
now
can
be
examined
as
it
relates
to
the
first
amendment.
first,
in
regard
to
the
context
of
the
solicitation,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
disputed
that
the
communications
we
are
dealing
with
here
are
not
ideas,
they
are
not
discussions
of
the
issues
or
of
opinions.
there
is
no
search
for
the
truth
here.
these
are
in
no
way
at
all
a
pursuit
by
man
for
his
higher
pursuits.
i
submit
that
at
the
minimum
these
solicitations
are
lewd
and
perhaps
they
may
be
obscene.
these
are
not
four-letter,
sexual
explicit
epithet
emblazed
on
the
jacket
of
an
individual
to
denote
some
political
position.
these
are
solicitations
which
are
wholly
erotic
in
nature
and
they
are
merely
meant
to
satisfy
the
personal
and
the
selfish
sexual
desires
of
the
solicitors.
much
of
the
conversations
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
deal
with
the
crime
of
prostitution
and
i
submit
are
clearly
not
protective.
we
submit
that
certainly
an
argument
can
be
made,
a
strong
argument
i
submit,
that
this
type
of
speech
should
be
denied,
all
constitutional
protection
based
upon
the
content.
however,
if
somehow
this
speech
is
minimally
protected
with
respect
to
the
content,
then
i
submit
that
in
the
context
of
which
it
is
uttered
clearly
prohibits
the
implication
of
a
first
amendment.
we
are
talking
about
a
public
street
here.
there
is
no
right
to
privacy
involved
here.
the
solicitations
are
not
occurring
in
one's
home.
these
are
in
a
public
area
that
belong
to
the
citizens
of
their
community.
they
are
delivered
indiscriminately,
with
the
key
here
that
they
are
delivered
without
any
indication
at
all
on
the
receptiveness
on
the
part
of
the
solicitee.
as
noted
earlier,
these
solicitations
involve
the
most
intimate
of
matters
and
they
are
made
without
the
consent
of
the
solicitee.
last
and
most
importantly
here,
the
solicitees'
rights
of
privacy
have
been
infringed
upon.
he
is
not
only
a
captive
listener
here,
but
he
is
forced
to
respond
even
if
by
abrupt
avoidance.
someone
directs
a
solicitation
at
that
person,
i
would
say
that
is
much
more
intimidating
than
even
in
colfax
or
in
laramie
where
the
conversation
was
not
directed
at
your
personally.
your
sexuality
now
becomes
a
topic
of
conversation
with
someone
who
may
be
a
total
stranger
to
you.
now,
with
regard
to
the
overbreadth,
mr.
uplinger
claims
here
and
suggests
that
the
statute
overreaches
with
respect
to
his
conduct
as
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
but,
the
respondents
raise
that
issue,
your
honor,
in
their
brief,
so
i
thought
that
the
court
here
may
want
to
deal
with
that.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
facts
regarding
the
solicitation
by
mr.
uplinger.
we
have
a
buffalo
police
officer
who
is
standing
on
the
steps
in
a
private
or
in
a
quiet
residential
area
of
the
city
of
buffalo.
mr.
uplinger
approached
the
buffalo
police
officer
and
after
the
initial
greetings
then
said
to
him,
do
you
want
to
get
high?
the
police
officer
responded
in
the
negative,
no.
then
a
group
of
other
individuals
came
over
and
they
were
involved
in
a
conversation
when
a
police
vehicle
arrived
and
the
police
officers
inside
asked
the
individuals
to
get
off
the
steps
and
to
leave
the
area.
at
the
time
the
buffalo
police
officer
separated
himself
from
mr.
uplinger
and
walked
away
from
mr.
uplinger.
mr.
uplinger
then
followed
or
pursued
the
police
officer
and
asked
him
if
he
would
come
over
to
his
house.
the
police
officer
responded...
he
said,
why
don't
you
come
over?
the
police
officer
then
said
i
am
afraid
with
the
police,
i
just
want
to
leave.
this
was
the
second
time
that
the
police
officer
refused
an
offer
by
mr.
uplinger.
at
this
point
in
time,
and
i
submit
in
an
offensive
way
and
i
submit
without
any
receptiveness
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer,
mr.
uplinger
asked
the
police
officer
to
come
over
to
his
house
to
engage
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy.
i
submit
here
that
the
real
argument
that
my
opponent
is
addressing
with
his
overbreadth
question
is
that
they
are
saying
that
since
these
type
of
solicitations
don't
both
them,
therefore,
the
public
must
tolerate
them
similarly
to
a
publicly
intoxicated
person
who
would
say
that
public
intoxication
doesn't
bother
me,
why
should
it
offend
you?
if
there
is
one
instance
where
there
may
be
a
possible
overbreadth,
i
submit,
that
is
if
an
individual
were
to
loiter
in
a
public
place
with
another
person
and
that
person
is
not
a
minor
and
he
knows
that
the
solicitee
is
receptive.
and,
that
one
instance,
i
submit,
there
could
be
a
possible
overbreadth.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no.
we
submitted
a
petition
for
cert
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
go
on
at
the
time
with
the
question
of
vagueness.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
your
honor.
i
do
cite
in
my
brief
the
model
penal
code
that
indicates
what
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
and
that
is
that
it
was
a
harassment
statute.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
your
honor,
there
wasn't.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
vagueness
question,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
possibility
for
arbitrary
enforcement
of
this
statute.
police
officers,
i
submit,
would
not
be
able
to
arrest
strictly
on
a
whim
or
a
guess
if
someone
were
merely
standing
on
a
street
corner,
but
that
they--
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
due
process
would
require
that
for
an
arrest
that
there
be
an
articulable,
overt
conduct
which
would
demonstrate
the
individual's
mental
state
before
arrest
could
occur.
in
the
case
of
mr.
uplinger,
we
have
a
direct
solicitation.
in
the
case
of
susan
butler,
we
have
her
loitering,
waving
at
an
automobile,
followed
by
an
observation
that
she
was
engaged
in
an
act
of
oral
sodomy.
furthermore,
due
process
would
require
that
before
a
conviction
that
there
would
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
submit
that
there
would
be
no
discriminatory
enforcement
based
solely
upon
anyone's
status
regarding
this
case.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
or
the
face
of
the
law
that
is
directed
at
anyone's
status.
the
fact
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
relates
only
to
conduct
and
activity
and
not
sexual
preference
or
any
criminal
reputation.
the
respondents
also
raise
the
question
regarding
notice
and
they
allude
to
the
other
behavior
of
a
deviate
nature
which
is
the
second
severable
part
of
that
statute.
i
submit
that
this
challenge
to
the
portion
of
the
law
under
which
he
was
not
charged
is
not
a
facial
challenge.
it
is
a
challenge
to
a
severable
part
of
the
law
which
has
not
been
charged,
and,
therefore,
she
is
precluded
from
raising
that
question
under
precedent
of
this
court.
in
regard
to
the
last
issue,
and
this
is
under-inclusiveness,
the
opponent
suggests
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
flawed
because
it
prohibits
solicitations
or
deviate
sexual
intercourse
and
not
normal
sexual
intercourse.
i
submit
that
new
york
does
prohibit
solicitations
for
normal
sex
under
the
general
harassment
statute
and
that
statute,
however,
does
require
an
intent
to
harass.
i
believe
that
what
occurred
here
is
that
the
legislature
felt
that
this
type
of
conduct
was
so
offensive
to
the
general
public
that
they
decided
to
make
this
a
strict
liability
statute.
in
conclusion,
i
ask
that
this
court
act
on
behalf
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
and
their
right
not
only
to
privacy
but
tranquility
in
their
neighborhood
and
i
ask
that
you
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
j.
arcara
your
honor,
i
will
waive
my
rebuttal.
