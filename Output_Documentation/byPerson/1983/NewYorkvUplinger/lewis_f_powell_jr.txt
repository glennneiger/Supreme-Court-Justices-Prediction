justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
proceed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
legislative
history
that
sheds
light
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
that
was
its
purpose?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
dissenting
opinion
there
is
a
statement
that
every
indication
is
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
regulate
public
conduct
which
would
be
considered
offensive.
there
is
no
citation
or
documentation
of
that.
do
you
have
any
in
mind?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gardner,
in
that
connection,
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
here,
and
now
i
understand
you
to
say
that
we're
bound
by
the
construction
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--would
not
leave
us
free,
perhaps,
to
consider
any
other
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
