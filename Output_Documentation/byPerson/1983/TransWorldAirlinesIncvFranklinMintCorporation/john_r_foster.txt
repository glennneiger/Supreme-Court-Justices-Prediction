mr.
john
r.
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
of
an
issue
which
should
be
resolved
by
the
other
branches,
but
which
by
default
has
become
a
judicial
problem,
and
a
consequence
of
that
fact
is
that
no
matter
what
this
court
decides,
the
decision
is
going
to
be
to
some
extent
unsatisfactory.
now,
before
the
circuit
court,
four
possible
ways
of
interpreting
article
22
were
presented.
the
circuit
court
held
that
as
to
each
possibility,
there
were
powerful,
devastating
arguments
against
each.
the
second
circuit's
resolution
of
the
problem
was
to
choose
a
fifth
course
of
action,
and
the
government
and
twa
have
been
quick
to
point
out
the
problems
with
that
solution
to
the
problem.
franklin
mint's
position
is
that
the
gold
franc
in
article
22
can
best
be
converted
into
united
states
dollars
by
reference
to
the
free
market
value
of
gold
at
the
time
when
the
contract
of
carriage
was
breached.
if
the
court
is
unable
to
accept
that
conversion
interpretation,
the
second
best
option
is
to
adopt
the
conclusion
reached
by
the
second
circuit,
namely,
that
a
political
question
is
involved
in
making
a
decision
as
to
the
proper
conversion
factor,
and
that
that
decision
really
belongs
to
the
other
branches
and
not
the
judiciary.
now,
franklin
mint's
position
that
the
free
market
price
should
be
used
really
rests
on
three
grounds.
the
first
is,
going
back
to
what
mr.
justice
stevens
was
pointing
out,
the
text
of
the
treaty.
the
treaty
says
65
and
a
half
milligrams
of
gold,
and
what
franklin
mint
says
is
that
in
this
case
the
cargo
should
have
been
delivered
on
march
26th,
1979.
you
look
in
the
wall
street
journal,
the
new
york
times,
the
journal
of
commerce,
you
find
out
what
the
price
of
gold
is,
and
that
gives
you
a
limitation.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
issue
is--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
at
the
time
that
the
treaty
was
drafted,
your
honor,
there
really
wasn't
a
conflict
between
an
official
price
and
a
free
market
price,
because
they
were
for
all
intents
and
purposes
one
and
the
same.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
what
happened
is
that
following
1968,
when
they
went
into
this
two-tier
system,
and
there
was
a
divergency
between
the
official
price
and
the
free
market
price,
starting
in
the
early
seventies,
people
started
to
say,
how
do
we
resolve
this
problem,
and
the
montreal
protocols
that
mr.
romans
mentioned
was
one
way
of
resolving
this
problem.
so,
yes,
you
are
entirely
correct
in
saying
that
when
the
par
value
modification
act
was
passed,
the
problem
was
well
known,
but
it
was
also
something
that,
although
not
raised
in
the
context
of
the
par
value
modification
act,
was
felt
to
be
a
major
problem
that
should
be
resolved,
and
was
being
resolved
through
negotiation
of
treaties.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
two--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
two
points
on
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
on
the
standard
form
of
a
way
bill,
which
is
set
by
the
international
air
transport
association,
there
are
two
boxes.
one
is
the
declared
value
for
the
purposes
of
carriage,
and
that
was
the
box
that
mr.
romans
was
referring
to
that
was
filled
in
with
no
value
declared.
there
is
another
box
for
declaration
of
the
value
for
customs
purposes,
and
that
was
filled
in
$67,000.
so
twa
knew
that
they
had
a
valuable
cargo.
the
second
point
is,
to
answer
your
question--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--yes,
your
honor,
and
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
reason,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
most
at
least
sophisticated
international
shippers
cover
the
problem
by
insurance.
there
is
no
reason
for
them
to
pay
an
insurance--
mr.
john
r.
foster
there's
no
reason
why
they
should
pay
an
insurance
premium
and
increased
freight
rate,
when
the
increased
freight
rate
is
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
insurance
underwriter--
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes
and
no,
your
honor.
yes
in
the
case...
in
the
context
of
cargo,
because
this
case
comes
down
to
basically
a
dispute
between
the
insurance
companies.
no
in
the
context
of
passengers,
because
in
international
transportation,
the
only
person
that
isn't
insured
by
and
large
are
passengers,
and
that
also
has
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
convention,
because
when
the
convention
was
drafted
in
1929...
well,
lindberg
crossed
the
atlantic
in
1927,
earhart
did
it
in
1928.
anyone
who
was
flying
planes
had
to
be
crazy,
and
certainly
knew
what
the
risk
was,
and
one
of
the
changes
that
has
occurred
since
1929
is,
people
willy-nilly
hop
on
a
plane
to
montreal
and
don't
know
that
the
liability
regime
is
drastically
different
than
if
they
hop
on
a
plane
to
go
skiing
in
colorado.
so,
the
really...
the
real
party
with
exposure
in
this
situation
are
the
passengers,
and
they
are
bound
by
the
same
gold
franc
unit,
although
the
limits
are
different
than
cargo.
in
addition
to
the
text
of
the
treaty,
the
franklin
mint's
argument
in
favor
of
the
free
market
value
is
also
supported
by
the
intent
of
the
drafters.
now,
the
drafting
minutes
for
the
warsaw
conference
of
1929
are
reproduced,
the
pertinent
parts,
in
the
joint
appendix
starting
at
page
158.
and
what
that
shows
is
that
going
into
the
final
conference,
the
drafters
had
a
limit
based
on
a
gold
franc,
and
that
has
to
be
also
seen
in
the
context
of
the
time,
because
prior
to
world
war
one,
most
of
the
major
currencies
were
on
a
gold
standard.
they
went
off
during
world
war
one,
and
following
world
war
one,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
economic
instability,
the
classic
example
being
the
german
hyperinflation
of
1920-23,
where
people
had
to
have
a
bushelful
of
reichsmarks
just
to
buy
a
loaf
of
bread.
so,
during
the
twenties,
when
the
conference
was
being
drafted,
they
knew
the
currencies
could
be
radically
devalued
in
a
brief,
short
period
of
time,
so
what
they
took
was
international
value.
going
into
the
conference,
they
had
this
gold
franc.
france,
which
had
just
a
short
time
previously
stabilized
its
currency
by
going
back
on
the
gold
standard,
raised
the
suggestion
that
instead
of
having
the
gold
franc,
why
don't
we
just
have
the
regular
french
franc?
the
swiss
delegates'
response
was,
what
happens
if
you
redefine
the
french
franc?
the
french
delegates
said,
in
essence,
what
difference
does
it
make?
the
convention
is
only
for
a
couple
of
years
anyway.
the
response
to
that
was,
i
don't
care
if
we
take
a
gold
dollar
or
a
gold
franc,
but
let's
take
a
gold
value.
so,
it
was
recognized
then
that
the
limit
has
to
be
based
on
a
gold
value.
in
the
mid-1950's,
there
were
a
series
of
conferences
to
revise
the
warsaw
convention,
and
in
the
hague
protocol
in
1955,
the
fact
that
a
gold
value
was
intended
was
retained
in
article
22
of
that
protocol,
which
the
united
states
did
not
adhere
to,
although
they
were
one
of
the
prime
movers
of
the
conference,
and
in
that
article
22,
the
present
article
22
and
the
warsaw
convention
was
kept,
but
there
was
a
sentence
added
which
said,
"conversion
of
the
sums
into
national
currencies
other
than
gold
shall
in
case
of
judicial
proceedings
be
made
according
to
the
gold
value
of
such
currencies
at
the
date
of
the
judgment.
"
so,
it
was
recognized
in
the
mid-fifties
that
we
are
talking
about
gold,
and
in
fact
when
the
discussions
leading
up
to
the
hague
protocol
were
being
made,
the
airlines
themselves
were
offering
as
an
argument
for
why
they
didn't
have
to
increase
the
limit
of
liability
the
fact
that
the
limits
on
gold
had
increased,
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
reason
to
increase
the
number
of
gold
francs
because
the
increase
in
the
value
of
gold
had
taken
care
of
the
problem.
so,
the
text
of
the
treaty,
the
intent
of
the
drafters
supports
the
use
of
a
gold
value.
and
the
final
point
is
the
practice
in
the
united
states.
from
1934,
when
the
united
states
adhered
to
the
convention,
until
the
present
time,
there
has
been
no
question
that
a
gold
value
has
to
be
used.
what
has
happened
is
that
the
price
between
the
free
market
value
and
the
official
price
has...
there
has
been
a
wide
divergence,
and
the
official
price
has
now
disappeared.
the
airlines
were
given
a
subsidy
in
1929
in
order
to
protect
an
infant
industry.
the
fear
in
1929
was
that
with
these
new
companies,
a
single
crash
could
wipe
out
the
company.
they
would
have
problems
in
attracting
capital.
they
would
have
problems
in
obtaining
liability
insurance.
that
has
radically
changed
now,
and
in
fact,
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
pointed
out,
there
are
foreign
air
carriers
that
are
agencies
of
foreign
governments.
twa
itself
is
a
big
company
and
a
subsidiary
of
an
even
bigger
company.
just
as
franklin
mint
has
its
cargo
insurance,
twa
and
the
other
air
carriers
have
their
liability
insurance.
so,
that
initial
concern
back
in
1929
no
longer
exists,
but
what
the
carriers
are
trying
to
do
is
to
keep
that
subsidy
that
they
got
in
1929.
now,
one
way
of
resolving
the
problem
is
by
adopting
the
free
market
price
of
gold.
the
convention
says
gold,
and
by
adopting
the
free
market
value,
you
adhere
to
the
text
and
the
spirit.
the
limit
will
increase,
but
it
still
exists.
if
the
court
feels,
though,
that--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
as
i
recall,
the
limit
would
have
been
approximately
around
$80,000.
now,
the
declared
value
of
the
cargo
was,
as
i
said,
i
think
about
$67,000.
that
was
based
on
the
customs
value.
the
amount
stated
in
the
complaint,
which
was
$250,000,
was
based
on
the
fair
market
value
of
the
goods
at
the
time
and
place
of
destination,
which
is
a
different
standard
than
the
customs
value.
now,
the
second
circuit's
decision--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
because,
your
honor,
the
customs
value
was
based
on
the
sale
by
franklin
mint
company
in
pennsylvania
to
franklin
mint,
limited,
in
england.
what
they
were
was
not
actually
gold
coins.
they
were,
as
the
way
bill
said,
they
were
metal
stamping
dies
used
to
produce
the
silver
coins,
actually,
that
would
be
used
to
market,
for
example,
art
treasures
of
the
vatican,
things
of
that
sort.
and
those
dies
being
used
to
produce
silver
coins
would
have
resulted
in
a
fair
market
value
of
the
goods
at
the
time
of
delivery
of
about
$250,000.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
and
twa
have,
i
think,
somewhat
misstated
the
problem
by
presenting
the
second
circuit's
decision
as
being
one
of
abrogation.
this
isn't
a
situation
where
you
have,
for
example,
the
normal
way
in
which
it
has
arisen
is
some
sort
of
revenue
or
tariff
provision
being
in
conflict
with
a
u.s.
treaty.
the
conflict
here
involving
the
par
value
modification
act
and
the
treaty
is
much
deeper,
more
fundamental,
because
what
was
being
done
by
the
congress
is
removing
an
assumption
on
which
article
22
had
been
interpreted
for
the
past
45
years.
in
other
words,
an
official
price
of
gold.
now,
the
article
22
as
it
now
stands
is
a
gold
clause.
if
you
take
special
drawing
rights
or
$42.22
per
gold,
what
you
are
doing
is
changing
that
gold
clause
into
a
currency
clause,
and
that
is
most
clearly
the
case
in
the
special
drawing
rights,
because
a
special
drawing
right
is
just
an
average
of
five
currencies,
and
what
happens
then
is,
a
claimant's
recovery
rises
or
falls
based
on
what
happens
to
those
currencies.
what
the
drafters
of
the
convention
intended
was
that
the
recovery
be
tied
to
gold.
less
clearly,
although
still
the
case,
is
the
situation
if
you
use
$42.22.
that
was
the
last
official
price
of
gold,
and
by
taking
a
price,
fixing
it
in
time,
what
that
means
is,
from
here
on
in,
a
claimant's
recovery
rises
or
falls
based
on
the
value
of
42.22,
and
not
anything
dealing
with
gold,
and
it
was
again,
as
i
said,
the
drafters'
intention
to
have
it
tied
to
gold.
now,
franklin
mint's
position
is
that
article
22
can
be
interpreted
consistently
with
the
text
and
the
intent
of
the
convention's
drafters
by
using
the
free
market
price
of
gold.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
best
way
of
avoiding
the
whole
problem--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--yes,
your
honor,
although
not
as
a
first
option.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
foster
based
on--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
based
on
franklin
mint's
preferred
resolution
of
the
problem--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--yes,
your
honor,
taking--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
if
the
court
is
unable
to
take
the
free
market
value,
then
i
think
the
only
alternative
is
to
adopt
the
second
circuit's
rationale.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
the
conclusion,
your
honor,
is
based
on
when
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court,
there
will
be
a
trial
or
a
finding
on
damages.
the
district
court
should
enter
judgment
for
either
the
market
value
of
the
goods
or
the
limit
based
on
free
market
value,
whichever
is
lower.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
that's...
i
mean,
the
theoretical
possibility
that,
say,
franklin
mint
is
bound
by
the
amounts
stated
for
customs
purposes,
which
could
be
lower
than
the
amount
of
the
limit
using
the
free
market
value,
but...
in
other
words,
if
the
free
market
value
limit
is
$80,000,
and
franklin
mint's
damages
are
$67,000
because
of
the
customs
value,
then
the
court
would
have
to
take
the
lower
amount.
now,
the
reason
why
i
say
that
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
the
second
best
option
is
because
you
an
avoid
the
whole
problem
by
taking
the
free
market
price
of
gold.
the
problem
with
not
taking
the
free
market
price
of
gold
is
that
you
then
get
into
these
options
that
have
been
proposed
by
the
government
and
by
twa.
and
the
interesting
point
is
that
in
the
lower
court...
well,
in
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit,
twa
was
also
pressing
for
the
current
french
franc,
and
in
this
court
that
has
sort
of
dropped
by
the
wayside,
and
in
the
district
court
the
preferred
measure
was
the
special
drawing
right,
and
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
this
court
it
has
become
the
last
official
price
of
gold,
so--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--well,
your
honor,
in
march
the
senate
had
before
it
the
montreal
protocols,
and
that
set
of
protocols
would
do...
would
resolve
the
whole
problem.
namely,
it
would
change
the
gold
franc
unit
to
a
special
drawing
right.
the
problem
is
that
the
senate
soundly
rejected
that
treaty.
apparently,
it
was
the
first
time
since
about
1960
that
the
senate
had
rejected
a
treaty.
now,
either
the
senate
by
adopting...
giving
its
advice
and
consent
to
a
treaty,
or
both
houses
of
congress
through
domestic
legislation
could
do
exactly
what
your
honor
is
suggesting.
the
problem
is,
they
haven't
done
so,
and
there
is
no...
there
is
nothing
as
far
as
i
am
aware
of,
proposals
to
do
exactly
the
same.
as
you
point
out,
what
is
done
in
other
countries
is
exactly
that.
there
is
domestic
legislation
that
resolves
the
whole
problem.
for
example,
in
england,
they
have
statutory
instruments
which
are
similar
to
administrative
regulations,
although
of
somewhat
stronger
effect,
and
they
say,
this
is
how
you
resolve
the
problem.
we
don't
have
anything
of
that
sort
here,
which
is,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
it
has
become
a
judicial
problem.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
no,
your
honor.
the
one
point
where
franklin
mint
disagrees
with
the
second
circuit--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--is
that
if--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--then
what
the
court
should
do
is
say...
and
take
it
a
step
further
than
the
second
circuit
did,
that
as
of
april
1st,
1978,
given
the
changes
in
the
nature
of
gold
in
our
system,
the
article
22
limit
is
unenforceable,
and
it
is
up
to
the
other
branches
to
resolve
the
problem,
because
the
problem
here
is,
if
you
take
sdr's,
if
you
take
$42.22
an
ounce,
you
are
changing
the
basic
nature
of
article
22
from
a
gold
clause
into
a
currency
clause,
and
that
isn't
interpretation.
it
is
modification
of
a
treaty.
and
that
is
a
political
question
that
should
be
done
by
the
other
branches.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
it
goes
back
to
baker
v.
carr,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
is--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--in
other
words,
is
this
an
issue
that
has
been
delegated
by
the
constitution
to
the
other
branch?
making
treaties
is.
is
it
a
subject
in
which
the
other
branches
have
expertise?
it
certainly
is.
if
you
are
going
to
change
article
22
from
what
it
presently
is,
a
gold
clause,
to
a
currency
clause,
that
is
a
political
question.
it
is
not
interpreting
a
treaty.
a
clear
example
of
interpreting
the
treaty
is
one
of
mr.
romans'
earlier
cases,
day
v.
twa.
that
involved
people
who
were
standing
in
line,
waiting
to
get
on
the
plane,
and
they
were...
some
terrorists
threw
a
bomb,
and
the
question
was,
people
standing
in
line,
are
they
covered
by
the
convention
or
not,
and
that
is
the
typical
problem
in
interpreting
a
treaty
having
general
language
referring
to
specific
facts.
mr.
john
r.
foster
well,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--first
of
all,
the
cab
order
that
mr.
romans
referred
to
was
promulgated
during
the
time
when
there
was
an
official
price
of
gold,
and
what
happened
was,
as
the
official
price
of
gold
would
periodically
change,
the
cab
would
come
out
with
an
order
saying,
this
is
what
the
new
limits
are.
the
cab
itself
has
really
been...
there
are
internal
memoranda
discussing
what
they
should
do
with
the
problem,
and
one
of
the
documents
in
the
joint
appendix
which
was
originally
presented
by
mr.
romans
was
a
memorandum
in
which
the
writer
said,
"the
board
has
for
the
past
five
years
been
engaging
in
a
legal
fiction,
namely,
the
$42
figure.
"
and
that
is
at
page
ja-40,
and
going
on,
saying,
"use
of
the
last
official
rate
of
gold,
however,
may
at
times
prevent
passengers
from
recovering
the
full
extent
of
damages
caused
by
the
carriers.
"
"carriers
may
no
longer
need
the
protection
of
these
low
limits,
given
the
maturation
of
the
aviation
industry
since
1929.
"
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
best
thing
to
do
is
get
together
with
state,
with
treasury,
with
transportation,
and
let
them
worry
about
it,
because
the
cab
is
going
out
of
business,
and
it
will
be
up
to
them
to
resolve
the
matter
in
the
future.
in
a
later
order,
and
that
is
cab
order
81-3-143,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
before
the
second
circuit,
the
cab
in
an
order
dealing
with
sdr's
dropped
a
footnote
and
said,
and
this
order
was
in
1981,
"we
don't
indicate
by
this
order
any
views
as
to
what
the
value
of
the
gold
franc
in
the
convention
is.
"
so,
there
is
really,
as
the
second
circuit
said,
the
cab
order
has
really
been
retained
more
by
the
law
of
inertia
as
opposed
to
any
concrete
policy
decision,
just
simply
because
they
recognize
that
the
cab
is
going
out
of
business,
in
essence,
and
other
people
are
going
to
have
to
worry
about
it,
and
quite
frankly,
if
the
senate
approved
the
montreal
protocols,
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem.
if
the
congress
passed
legislation,
that
would
take
care
of
the
problem
as
well.
so,
going
back
to
the
whole
problem
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
which
is
one
of
the
principal
issues,
the
problem
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
article
22.
franklin
mint
contends
it
is
a
gold
clause,
and
that
the
only
way
you
can
interpret
it
as
a
gold
clause--
mr.
john
r.
foster
--yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
whole
point
back
in
1929,
to
protect
the
infant
airline
industries.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
in
the
airline
deregulation
act,
they
said...
they
expressed
a
strong
policy
argument
in
favor
of
free
competition,
but
that
doesn't
resolve
the
court's
problem
in
saying
how
you
convert
those
gold
francs
into
dollars,
and
franklin
mint
says,
use
the
gold
franc...
use
the
free
market
value
of
gold.
that
still
gives
the
airline
its
limit,
albeit
at
a
higher
level.
now,
if
you
want
to
change
it
into
a
currency
clause,
though,
that
is
for
the
other
branches
to
do,
and
that
can
be
done
through
the
montreal
protocols
using
sdr's.
mr.
john
r.
foster
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
it
can
be
put,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
foster
yes,
sir.
the
one
point,
though,
where
i
would
disagree
with
the
second
circuit
is
the
question
that
the
second
circuit
only
applied
its
ruling
prospectively.
that
type
of
ruling
has
traditionally
been
done
in
the
context
of
criminal
cases
or
this
court's
decision
on
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
there
is
no
reason
that
if
the
nature
of
gold
changed
as
of
april
1st,
1978,
that
that
date
should
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
the
court's
decision.
just
to
conclude,
i
would
point
out
that
the
problem
here
is
the
fact
that
you
have
a
convention
drafted
in
1929
for
a
different
world,
and
the
problem
is
trying
to
cram
1929
language
into
the
realities
of
the
1980's.
it
can
be
done
with
a
bit
of
bootstrapping,
but
by
and
large
it
involves
problems
that
should
really
be
handled
by
the
other
branches.
the
only
way
of
doing
it
consistently
is
to
take
the
free
market
value.
otherwise,
the
second
circuit
decision
should
be
upheld
but
made
retroactive
as
of
april
1st,
1978.
thank
you.
