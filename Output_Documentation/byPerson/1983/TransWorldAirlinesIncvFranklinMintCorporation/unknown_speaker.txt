unknown
speaker
when?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
believe
the
briefs
put
it
out,
but
i
am
curious.
unknown
speaker
and
will
you
tell
us
how
they
were
lost
as
you
go
along?
unknown
speaker
the
procedure
you
just
described
is
permissible
under
the
warsaw
convention?
unknown
speaker
why
should
that
be
favored
simply
because
the
united
states
as
a
party
litigant
favors
it?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
those
units
of
the
government
have
the
power
to
abrogate
or
modify
treaties?
unknown
speaker
the
executive
by
himself
could
modify
this
treaty?
unknown
speaker
well,
really,
you
are
not
contending
it
is
no
longer
in
force.
unknown
speaker
you
are
arguing
it
is
in
force.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
has
been
abrogated,
what
is
the
source
of
a
limit
of
liability,
any
limit,
now?
well,
you
mean
it
has
been
abrogated
by
the
second
circuit
decision.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
are
referring
to
all
these
other
branches
of
the
united
states
government.
i
am
asking
you,
do
any
of
those
branches
have
the
authority
to
redefine
the
terms
of
this
treaty?
unknown
speaker
so
why
are
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general
any
more
persuasive
than
those
of
any
other
litigant?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
just
their
experience,
is
it?
isn't
it
their
concern?
the
government
has
a
responsibility.
the
government's
relations
with
other
countries
can
be
affected
by
how
a
treaty
is
construed.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
counsel,
that
even
before
the
repeal
of
the
par
value
modification
act,
the
free
market
price
of
gold
had
fluctuated
and
might
have
been
above
that
value,
so
people
were
well
aware
of
that
before
the
repeal,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
no
one
then
questioned
whether
it
should
be
the
official
price
that
was
followed
under
the
warsaw
convention.
unknown
speaker
right,
i
am
talking
about
this
country.
unknown
speaker
so,
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
by
congress
that
it
intended
to
alter
the
warsaw
convention,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
alter
the
formula
that
we
follow,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
romans,
is
there
any
room
here
for
an
interpretation
that
the
parties
intended
to
take
the
dollar
value
of
gold,
which
i
gather
is
what
you
are
suggesting,
of
the
gold
franc
just
before
we
went
off
the
gold
standard
and
inflating
it
by
some
appropriate
index
of
inflation
of
the
dollar
since
that
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
that
come
closer
to
effectuating
the
signatories
in
fact?
unknown
speaker
could
twa
by
contract,
by
its
contract,
given
all
the
limitations
of
the
treaty
and
the
statutes,
have
provided
that
liability
should
not
be
beyond
the
declared
value
of
the
shipment?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
what
the
declared
value
was
here,
or
was
there
one?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
mr.
schwartz,
there
are
cases
under
the
law
of
contracts
and
contract
remedies,
aren't
there,
where
the
courts
won't
say
that
a
particular
contract
is
non-justiciable,
but
they
will
say
that
the
contract
is
simply
unenforceable,
or
that
impossibility
has
arisen.
there
is
a
whole
law
of
contract
remedy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
of
the
four
alternatives
that
the
court
of
appeals
considered,
which
in
the
view
of
the
government
most
closely
approximates
the
language
of
the
convention?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
am
curious
to
have
an
answer
to
my
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
prefer
not
to
answer
my
question?
or
don't
you
have
an
answer?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
though,
you
do
not
contend
the
position
that
you
advocate
most
closely
approximates
the
language
of
the
agreement.
you
don't
make
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
only
refer
to
the
plain
language
if
forced
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
treaty
also
expressly
refers,
does
it
not,
to
conversion
to
a
national
currency?
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
adopted,
that
was
clearly
thought
in
this
country
to
refer
to
the
official
rate
of
gold,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
unhappy
because
the
free
market
has
changed
so
much
and
the
par
value
modification
act
was
repealed,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
alters
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
treaty
at
the
time
it
was
done.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
there
certainly
was,
before
the
repeal
of
the
par
value
modification
act,
there
was
quite
a
disparity,
and
nobody
was
objecting
to
the
warsaw
convention
official
rate
price.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
why
franklin
mint
didn't
declare
the
value
of
these
items--
unknown
speaker
--when
it
shipped
them.
unknown
speaker
a
valuable
cargo
for
which
the
franklin
mint
didn't
want
to
pay
anything
but
the
base
rate.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose...
and
franklin
got
independent
insurance
coverage
for
these
things?
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
that
is
the
case,
why
do
you
care,
is
it
really
a
quarrel
of
the
insurance
carrier
that
is
at
issue
here,
wanting
something
back?
unknown
speaker
--mr.
foster,
before
you
leave
that,
under
your
proposal
that
they
take
the
date
of
the...
due
date
of
delivery,
what
would
the
limit
have
been
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
why
is
there
that
great
difference
between
67
and
200?
unknown
speaker
the
cargo
really
had
three
different
values,
then,
the
real
value,
the
customs
value,
and
the
declared
value
of
twa.
unknown
speaker
i
am
bothered
by
the
way
these
different
values
are
tossed
around
as
though
they
are
completely
insignificant,
that
there
is
a
virtue
in
inconsistency.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
you
don't
support
the
second
circuit's
conclusion
that
the
convention
is
unenforceable
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
support
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
your...
you
ask
us
to
reverse
and
direct
the
entry
of
a
judgment
for
the
actual
amount
of
franklin
mint's
damages.
unknown
speaker
or
alternatively
to
enter
a
judgment
for
franklin
mint
for
the
lower
of
the
two
amounts.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
support--
unknown
speaker
--i
know,
but
that
is
by
interpretation
of
the
convention,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
asking
us
to
say,
as
the
second
circuit
said--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
convention
is
unenforceable
for
the
future,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
reach
your
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say,
enter
a
judgment
for
the
actual
amount
of
franklin
mint's
damages.
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
these
arguments
sound
very
much
like
arguments
that
might
well
be
addressed
to
the
congress
rather
than
the
courts,
and
i
wonder
whether
the
congress
is
presently
considering
any
legislation
to
correct--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps
i
don't
understand
you,
mr.
foster,
but
you
just
told
me
that
if
we
don't
adopt
your
suggestion
of
the
free
market
value
price
of
gold,
that
then
we
should,
what,
affirm
the
court
of
appeals?
that
is
your
alternative?
unknown
speaker
and
affirm
including
the
$42.22,
whatever
that
price
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
we
going
to
replace
that
with,
if
we
reject
your
free
market
value
of
gold?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
are
saying
is,
that
applies
as
much
to
the
portion
of
the
district
court
judgment
to
fix
$42.22
insofar
as
it
did--
unknown
speaker
--as
it
does
to
the
rest
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
we
should
just
say
that
this
is
something
beyond
judicial
competence
to
handle,
and--
unknown
speaker
--toss
the
whole
problem
to
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
foster?
you
have
indicated
that
another
branch
of
the
government
should
take
care
of
the
problem,
and
in
other
countries
something
approaching
legislation,
not
necessary
the
statute
in
england
has
done,
but
why
then
isn't
the
cab
order
the
sort
of
thing
that
has
answered
the
question
for
this
country?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
really
talked
about
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
above
all,
isn't
it
a
limitation
of
liability
clause
more
than
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it
should
be
decided
that
the
infant
airline
industries
are
no
longer
infants
and
don't
deserve
protection
any
more,
that
is
for
congress,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
i
gather
it
is
not
a
political
question
case
outside
of
judicial
competence
if
we
adopt
your
interpretation
of
free
market
price
of
gold.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
a
political
question
case
if
we
reject
your
suggestion?
unknown
speaker
mr.
romans,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
treaty
had
been
drafted
in
the
plainest
of
language,
which
said,
we
want
to
use
the
price
of
gold.
we
understand
and
expect
for
the
next
50
years
that
is
the
most
stable
point
of
reference
we
can
find.
we
don't
anticipate
any
change.
they
spelled
it
out
perfectly
clearly.
and
then
the
market
developed
the
way
it
is
now.
what
would
we
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
the
language
clearly
picked
gold.
would
it
become
unforceable,
or
would
we
substitute
something
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
your
argument
is,
it
is
not
all
that
plain,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
force
to
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
am
asking...
my
question
is,
supposing
the
language
of
the
treaty
were
different,
and
unambiguously
said,
we
want
the
point
of
reference
to
be
the
free
market
price
of
gold,
and
the
legislative
history
shows
nobody
dreamed
this
would
happen
to
the
free
market
price.
what
would
our
duty
be
in
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
nobody
wants
to
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
have
given
you
all
the
facts.
what
would
our
duty
be
on
that
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
what
would
our
duty
be
on
that
hypothetical?
assuming
plain
language
and
this
highly
unanticipated
development
and
undesirable
development.
