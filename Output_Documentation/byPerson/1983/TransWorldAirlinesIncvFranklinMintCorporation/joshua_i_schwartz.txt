mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
appeared
in
this
case
to
urge
rejection
of
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
warsaw
convention
liability
limitation
for
cargo
is
henceforth
unenforceable.
the
overriding
reason
for
the
united
states'
concern
about
the
decision
below
is
that
by
judicial
fiat
it
destroys
the
united
states'
commitment
to
an
important
treaty
regime
to
which
this
nation
has
subscribed
by
the
constitutionally
prescribed
procedure
of
negotiation
by
the
executive
and
advice
and
consent
by
the
senate.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
this
untoward
result
was
not
required
by
any
act
of
congress,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
compelled
by
any
article
3
limitation
upon
the
power
of
united
states
courts.
rather,
we
believe
that
the
ordinary
process
of
interpretation
and
construction
of
agreements,
and
treaties
are
in
a
sense
an
agreement,
enables
united
states
courts
to
give
effect
to
the
intention
of
the
treaty
parties
that
liability
for
carriers
be
limited.
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
recognize
that
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
courts
to
abrogate
treaties,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
really
any
basis
for
disputing
that
the
result
of
this
decision
is
to
destroy
the
united
states'
commitment
that
liability
of
carriers
will
be
limited.
the
carrier
in
this
case
happens
to
be
a
domestic
corporation,
but
perhaps
this
would
be
even
clearer
if
you
thought
about
a
case
involving
a
foreign
carrier,
perhaps
even
a
foreign
state
carrier.
the
international
conflict
potential
is
clear.
in
light
of
the
potential
foreign
relations
repercussions
of
this
decision
and
also
the
explicit
constitutional
commitment
of
the
treatymaking
function
to
the
executive,
we
submit
that
there
simply
was
no
sufficient
justification
for
the
court
of
appeals'
pronouncement
that
the
warsaw
convention
liability
limitation
cannot
operate
in
the
future.
in
treaty
interpretation,
the
overriding
imperative
for
the
courts
is
to
give
effect
to
the
intention
of
the
parties,
and
in
doing
so
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
liberal
and,
one
might
say,
sympathetic
approach
to
discerning
the
intent
of
the
parties.
the
intent
may
not
always
be
perfectly
clear,
yet
the
court
should
go
the
last
mile
to
discern
that
intent
and
to
give
it
reasonable
effect.
in
this
case,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
concern
with
the
technical
issue
of
which
of
the
proffered
standards
of
conversion
was
the
technically
ideal
one
lost
sight
of
the
fundamental
point
of
the
warsaw
convention.
the
purpose
of
the
contracting
nations
was
to
limit
liability.
that
much
we
are
certain
of.
various
choices
confronted
the
court
of
appeals.
the
choice
may
not
have
been
totally
clear,
but
we
do
know
this.
the
option
it
selected,
no
limit
of
liability,
was
the
one
choice
that
we
can
be
certain
was
not
intended
by
the
contracting
nations.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
it
was
an
impermissible
interpretation
of
the
treaty.
we
don't
find
any
basis
in
the
repeal
of
section
2
of
the
par
value
modification
act
for
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
render
a
standard
of
conversion
unavailable.
the
reasons
for
that
are
detailed
in
our
brief,
and
rather
than
dwell
on
that
somewhat
technical
issue,
i
thought
it
would
be
more
pertinent
to
spend
the
time
i
have
to
address
what
seemed
to
underlie
the
court
of
appeals'
concern
about
what
it
was
asked
to
do
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
believe
that
in
this
case
it
was
asked
to
make
a
policy
decision
that
lies
beyond
judicial
competence,
presumably
because
it
was
a
non-article
3
responsibility,
but
we
submit
that
the
kind
of
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
asked
to
make
here
was
not
of
that
nature.
the
relevant
policy
determinations
are
to
be
extracted
from
the
warsaw
convention
and
the
negotiating
history
of
that
convention.
the
convention
is
an
agreement,
as
i
have
said
before.
courts
are
frequently
called
upon
in
an
analogous
context
to
make
the
kind
of
determination
the
second
circuit
was
asked
to
make
here.
for
instance,
in
an
ordinary
private
contract
case
which
may
come
into
a
federal
court
in
a
diversity
matter,
if
there
is
a
clear
agreement
between
the
parties,
and
even
if
its
terms
are
not
perfectly
clear,
the
court
may
be
called
upon
to
interpret
it,
and
i
don't
believe
it
has
ever
been
suggested
that
a
court...
that
simply
because
the
right
answer,
the
right
interpretation
is
not
perfectly
clear,
that
a
court
can
throw
up
its
hands
and
say,
we
are
not
sure
if
it
was
right.
we
can't
decide
this
case.
it
is
non-justiciable.
there
are
other
contexts
in
which
courts
engage
in
similar
determinations.
we
have
mentioned
some
in
our
brief.
i
thought
another--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes,
but
if
i
could
pursue
that
analogy,
we
would
simply
submit
that
while
an
analogous
factor
might
operate
here,
in
fact
it
does
not,
because
it
was
not
impossible
to
give
effect
to
this
contract,
and
the
events
that
intervened
were
not
of
a
kind
that
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
liability
limitation
should
be
regarded
as
requiring
a
regime
of
unbounded
liability.
so,
i
can
accept
that
analogy
and
not
accept
the
result
that
the
second
circuit
pointed
to.
if...
in
addition
to
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
government's
view
is
that
the
$42.22
per
troy
ounce
most
closely
approximates
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
convention.
i
don't--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
don't...
i
am
about
to
acknowledge
that.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
reason
to
look
at
the
language
apart
from
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
don't
really
think
i
have
an
answer
that
would
be
useful.
if
i
could
give
one
other
example
of
situations
in
which
the
federal
courts--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
guess
if
forced
to
answer
the
question,
i
would
contend
that
our
alternative
does,
but
the
overriding
government
contention
in
this
case
is
that
that
choice
must
be
made
whether
it
is
perfect
or
not.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no,
we
would
read
the
plain...
we
would
read
the
language
together
with
the
history.
i
think
no
one
in
this
case
has
disputed
that
the
language
on
its
face
is
opaque
enough
in
light
of
modern
circumstances
to
require
elucidation,
and
the
idea
of
courts
filling
in
blanks
or
gaps
or
ambiguities
in
federal
law,
and
the
treaty
in
this
case
is
a
federal
law,
is
really
not
such
an
anomalous
one
as
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
believe.
the
examples
are
legion.
in
the
case,
for
instance,
of
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
this
court
held
in
textile
workers
against
lincoln
mills
that
congress
unambiguously
intended
federal
courts
to
decide
these
cases,
cases
concerning...
that
is,
cases
concerning
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
that
the
substantive
law
should
be
fashioned
by
the
courts
from
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
statutes.
so,
too,
here,
if
there
is
a
gap
in
the
substantive
law
relating
to
the
conversion
rate,
the
courts
are
provided
with
ample
authority
to
discern
an
adequate
conversion
standard.
one
more
point
that
i
think
is
useful
in
closing.
the
court
of
appeals
saw
this
as
a
policy
judgment,
and
it
might
well
be
a
policy
judgment
if
the
question
were,
what
standard
of
liability
shall
henceforth
govern
for
this
treaty
regime
in
some
abstract
sense,
but
the
court's
task
was
not
to
legislate.
the
court
in
a
sense
put
itself
in
the
bind
that
it
perceived.
the
court's
task
was
to
decide
the
case
before
it,
to
determine
an
amount
of
money
to
be
awarded,
and
in
determining
that
a
particular
amount
of
money,
$6,500
in
this
case,
for
instance,
adequately
comports
with
the
intentions
of
the
framers
of
the
warsaw
convention.
we
see
that
as
something
quite...
to
the
traditional
functions
of
the
courts.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
while
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
affirmed
because
it
is
consistent
with
our
position,
the
court's
declaration
that
the
warsaw
convention
is
henceforth
unenforceable
should
be
rejected.
thank
you.
