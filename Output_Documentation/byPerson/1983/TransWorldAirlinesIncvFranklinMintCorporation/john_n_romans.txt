mr.
john
n.
romans
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
to
be
decided
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
courts
are
dutybound
to
enforce
the
limitations
of
liability
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
if
so,
how
the
warsaw
gold
franc,
which
is
the
unit
used
to
express
that
limitation
of
liability,
is
to
be
converted
into
present
u.s.
dollars.
the
facts
are
agreed
and
quickly
stated.
franklin
mint
delivered
four
cartons
to
twa
in
philadelphia
for
shipment
to
london,
england.
mr.
john
n.
romans
in
march
of
1979,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
romans
that
is
when...
march
of
1979.
mr.
john
n.
romans
your
honor,
if
i
knew
how
they
were
lost,
we
might
not
be
here
today.
all
we
know
is
that
they
were
not
delivered
in
london,
and
we
could
not
find
them
anywhere
in
the
system.
we
do
know
that
the
four
cartons
weighed
714
pounds,
that
the
entire
fee
to
carry
them
to
london
was
less
than
$550,
and
we
do
know
that
franklin
mint
told
twa
that
one
carton
contained
"metal
stamping
dies,
metal
stampings,
numismatic,
articles
of
adornment.
"
and
that
the
three
other
packages
contained
"metal
stampings,
numismatic".
now,
when
the
packages
did
not
arrive
in
london,
franklin
mint
made
a
claim,
and
it
claimed
that
it
was
entitled
to
$250,000
because
it
turned
out
that
metal
stampings,
numismatic,
meant
gold
coins.
now,
franklin
mint
knew
that
twa's
limitation
of
liability
was
$20
per
kilogram,
and
that
its
overall
liability
was
$6,500,
based
on
the
weight
of
714
pounds.
franklin
mint
could
easily
have
avoided
this
limit
of
liability
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
it
could
have
declared
an
excess
value.
it
could
have
said,
look,
twa,
we
have
gold
coins
here,
and
they
are
worth
$250,000.
in
that
case,
twa
would
have
said,
yes,
you
have
declared
an
excess
value,
and
now
we
are
going
to
charge
an
excess
charge
for
this
high
value
shipment.
but
franklin
mint
chose
not
to
do
that.
mr.
john
n.
romans
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
no
value
was
declared,
and
in
the
box
for
declared
value,
franklin
mint
typed
in
the
initials
nvd>
["],
which
mean
no
value
declared,
and
the
gold,
of
course,
never
showed
up.
now,
on
oral
argument
before
judge
napp
of
the
district
court,
he
commented
that
franklin
mint
knew
that
there
was
gold
in
those
cartons.
evidently
the
thief
knew
that
there
was
gold
in
those
cartons.
only
twa
was
left
in
ignorance.
now,
we
moved
for
partial
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court
to
reduce
our
liability
to
our
limit
of
$6,500,
and
the
question
before
the
district
court,
as
is
here
today,
is,
how
do
you
convert
these
warsaw
gold
francs
into
u.s.
currency?
and
we
suggested
two
alternative
conversion
factors,
one
the
last
official
price
of
gold,
which
would
lead
to
the
$20
per
kilogram
limitation.
our
second
one
was
the
special
drawing
right,
a
unit
of
account
of
the
international
monetary
fund.
that
would
lead
to
a
limitation
of
liability
substantially
the
same.
franklin
mint
countered
and
suggested
that
the
market
price
of
gold
be
used
as
the
conversion
factor.
that
would
have
led
to
a
limit
of
liability
approximately
ten
times
higher,
because
the
market
price
of
gold
at
that
time
was
roughly
$420
per
ounce.
the
district
court
held
that
the
last
official
price
should
apply
because
that
was
the
conversion
factor
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
ordered
the
airlines
to
use
in
their
current
and
effective
order.
that
was
the
conversion
factor
that
all
of
the
airlines
listed
in
their
tariffs,
which
are
filed.
and
that
conversion
factor
constituted
as
close
as
anything
the
government's
interpretation
of
how
this
treaty
should
be
construed.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
and
after
affirming
it
said,
each
choice
has
a
powerful
argument
against
it.
enforcement
by
a
court
is
impossible,
so
60
days
from
the
issuance
of
the
court
of
appeals
mandate,
the
limitations
of
liability
of
this
treaty
will
be
unenforceable
in
united
states
courts.
now,
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
abrogation
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
stated
that
u.s.
courts
do
not
have
the
power,
absent
a
constitutional
infirmity,
to
abrogate
u.s.
treaties,
put
that
in
a
very
succinct
footnote,
number
26,
and
you
are
absolutely
right.
then
it
went
ahead
to
hold
that
courts
don't
have
the
power
under
these
facts
to
construe
the
warsaw
convention
in
order
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
drafters.
here,
i
feel
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error.
they
lost
sight,
in
my
view,
of
the
primary
purpose
of
this
treaty,
and
that
is,
it
sets
a
limitation
on
liability
and
also
a
floor.
what
is
not
always
so
readily
recognized
in
the
united
states
is
that
the
laws
of
many
countries,
and
there
are
over
120
which
adhere
to
this
treaty,
the
laws
of
many
countries
require
limitations
of
liability
which
are
much
lower
than
the
warsaw
convention,
and
the
warsaw
convention
says
that
the
limit
will
be
no
higher
than
$20
per
kilo,
but
it
also
says
any
agreement
entered
into
prior
to
the
loss
which
would
result
in
a
limit
lower
than
$20
a
kilo
is
void,
so,
the
convention
establishes
both
a
floor
and
a
ceiling.
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
opinion
on
the
fact
that
one
section
of
the
par
value
modification
act
had
been
repealed,
and
that
is
when
the
world
went
off
the
gold
standard
and
adopted
special
drawing
rights.
they
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
select
any
conversion
factor,
and
that
therefore
they
were
unable
to
construe
this
convention.
we
submit
that
neither
the
repeal
act
nor
the
legislative
history
mentions
the
warsaw
convention,
and
that
in
order
for
a
court
to
find
that
a
later
past
statute
has
abrogated
a
u.s.
treaty,
there
must
be
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
abrogate
that
treaty,
and
there
is
no
clear
intent.
in
fact,
judge
winter,
writing
for
the
second
circuit,
acknowledged
that
fact.
he
said,
"congress
may
not
have
focused
explicitly
on
the
convention
in
repealing
the
par
value
modification
act.
"
well,
we
have
researched
the
legislative
history,
and
there
is
no
mention
whatsoever.
now,
he
must
have
then
decided
that
legislative
silence
was
sufficient
to
abrogate
a
treaty,
and
pursuant
to
the
cases
in
this
court,
weinberger
v.
rossi,
for
example,
in
1982,
legislative
silence
cannot
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
clear
expression
to
abrogate
a
treaty.
furthermore,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
congress
knew
very
well
that
there
would
be
uses
for
the
last
official
price
of
gold
after
the
repeal
of
this
one
section
of
the
par
value
modification
act.
in
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
report
they
stated,
"while
it
is
the
express
intent
of
the
imf.
"
the
international
monetary
fund,
"to
move
gold
out
of
the
international
monetary
system,
there
are
vast
numbers
of
legal
and
psychological
mechanisms
that
will
perpetuate
some
role
for
gold.
"
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
several
roles
of
gold
which
are
perpetuated
today.
the
preferred
conversion
rate
is
the
last
official
price
of
gold,
and
the
most
important
reason
for,
or
the
basis
for
approving
that
conversion
rate
is
that
it
is
the
conversion
rate
favored
by
the
united
states.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
and
he
is
here
to
tell
you
today,
favors
the
last
official
price
of
gold.
mr.
john
n.
romans
your
honor,
the
united
states
is
here
amicus
curiae.
they
are
here
to
inform
this
court
of
the
views
of
the
state
department,
the
department
of
the
treasury,
the
department
of
transportation,
and
perhaps
other
units
of
this
government,
and
they
are
here
to
tell
you
that
the
united
states
interprets
this
treaty--
mr.
john
n.
romans
--yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
the
executive
does
have
the
power,
as
does
the
legislature,
but
courts
do
not
absent
a
clear
congressional
intent.
mr.
john
n.
romans
to
abrogate
the
treaty.
i
am
sorry.
did
you
say
modify?
mr.
john
n.
romans
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not,
but--
mr.
john
n.
romans
--i
am
contending
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
has
been
abrogated,
that
the
united
states
promised
all
of
its
treaty
partners
to
enforce
a
certain
limit
and
a
floor,
and
that
is
not
being
done.
mr.
john
n.
romans
correct.
mr.
john
n.
romans
that's...
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
romans
no,
your
honor.
that
has
to
be
done
in
a
convention,
with
all
the
treaty
partners
present.
mr.
john
n.
romans
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
this
court
interprets
a
treaty,
it
is
very
helpful
to
understand
how
the
government,
which
is
more
experienced
in
the
delicate
areas
of
foreign
relations,
views
the
treaty.
mr.
john
n.
romans
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
and
as
the
government
has
said
in
its
brief,
several
treaty
partners
have
communicated
their
displeasure
with
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
and
the
united
states
informs
this
court
that
our
foreign
relations
with
those
countries
in
the
aviation
area
will
be
seriously
affected,
and
this
is
a
way,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
the
united
states
can
assist
this
court,
bringing
this
kind
of
information
to
it.
mr.
john
n.
romans
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
very
well
aware
that
there
was
a
two-tier
system
since
1968
until
1978.
mr.
john
n.
romans
not
in
the
united
states,
your
honor,
because
the
law
was
very
clear.
mr.
john
n.
romans
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
issued
an
order,
and
that
order
is
still
in
effect.
we
are
commanded
to
make
this
conversion
according
to
the
last
official
price
of
gold.
moreover--
mr.
john
n.
romans
--precisely.
mr.
john
n.
romans
no,
your
honor.
not
precisely.
mr.
john
n.
romans
well,
actually,
this
question
has
been
studied
as
late
as
1975.
there
have
been
several
conventions
of
the
treaty
partners,
and
in
1975,
the
montreal
protocols
to
the
warsaw
convention
were
drafted
and
signed
by
the
united
states.
those
protocols
increased
significantly
the
limits
of
liability
for
death
and
personal
injury.
however,
it
was
determined
that
the
limit
of
liability
for
cargo
should
remain
at
the
same
level.
now,
that
was
expressed
in
terms
of
special
drawing
rights,
17
special
drawing
rights,
but
17
special
drawing
rights
amount
to
approximately
$20
per
kilogram,
so
that
the
parties
felt
that
the
limit
for
purposes
of
cargo
should
remain
at
that
level,
which
is
$20
per
kilogram.
now,
you
wonder
why,
after
all
these
years,
and
i
submit
to
you
it
is
because
of
the
advent,
really,
of
the
jet
engine.
planes
today
can
carry
efficiently
much
heavier
cargo,
and
because
the
limit
is
based
on
weight,
the
weight
of
a
heavy
shipment
will
give
that
shipper
sufficient
protection.
so
that
if...
for
example,
italians
ship
shoes
from
italy
to
the
united
states,
and
the
warsaw
limit
is
almost
always
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
cargo
of
those
shoes.
the
feeling
is
that
if
you
are
shipping
a
very
high
value
shipment,
gold
or
diamonds,
that
all
other
shippers
everywhere
should
not
have
to
participate
in
the
payment
to
ensure
that
extra
risk.
if
you
are
shipping
very
valuable
cargo,
you
should
pay
an
extra
premium,
and
you
can
do
that
by
declaring
an
excess
value
to
the
airline
and
paying
the
extra
charge,
or
you
can
buy
your
own
insurance.
mr.
john
n.
romans
no,
your
honor,
because
the
warsaw
convention
includes
in
its
provisions
an
article
23,
which
says
any
agreement
leading
to
a
lower
price
is
void.
that
is
part
of
the
floor.
you
see,
you
can't
say
to
a
shipper,
we
are
going
to
make
your
limit
less,
either.
mr.
john
n.
romans
there
was
no
declared
value.
there
is
just
one
other
main
point
that
i
would
like
to
say,
and
that
is
that
the
last
official
price
of
gold
is
being
used
today
by
the
united
states
when
it
makes
payments
to
the
world
bank.
the
united
states
is
obligated
to
make
its
payments
to
the
world
bank
in
united
states
gold
dollars,
but
those
gold
dollars
for
all
practical
purposes
of
this
argument
are
the
same
as
the
french
gold
francs.
they
are
a
unit
of
liability,
and
the
united
states
as
late
as
december
1,
1982,
made
payments
to
the
world
bank
and
it
used
the
last
official
price
of
gold
to
make
that
conversion,
so
that
the
last
official
price
of
gold
is
very
much
in
effect
today.
it
is
being
used
by
the
united
states.
they
support
its
use
for
purposes
of
the
warsaw
convention,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
the
preferred
conversion
factor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
n.
romans
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
the
words
in
the
treaty,
i
would
just
like
to
save
1,000
words
and
refer
you
to
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix.
this
is
the
market
price
of
gold,
this
jagged
mountain
range.
as
discussed
by
professor
lowenfeld,
an
expert
in
monetary...
international
monetary
transactions,
gold
is
now
"a
volatile
commodity,
not
related
to
a
price
index
or
to
the
rate
of
inflation,
or
indeed
to
any
meaningful
economic
measure
other
than
the
views
of
whoever
made
up
the
market
about
all
the
terrible
things
going
on
in
the
unpredictable
world.
"
this
is
what
you
will
do
to
a
businessman
if
you
choose
the
market
price
of
gold.
mr.
john
n.
romans
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
n.
romans
well,
your
honor,
i
contend
that--
mr.
john
n.
romans
--the
language
says
gold,
but...
can
i
suggest
that
the
language
also
says,
to
be
converted
into
national
currency.
mr.
john
n.
romans
but
the
words
in
the
treaty,
the
words
in
that
article
22
say,
to
be
converted
into
national
currency.
mr.
john
n.
romans
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case,
obviously.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
john
n.
romans
however...
no,
no,
no.
the
duty
of
a
court,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
treaty
area
particularly,
is
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
drafters,
and
as
judge
kaufman
said
in
the
day
case--
mr.
john
n.
romans
--what
would
my
argument
be?
mr.
john
n.
romans
all
right.
in
my
view,
in
order
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
drafters,
which
has
been
restated
as
late
as
1975
at
the
montreal
conference,
this
court
should
use
the
last
official
price
of
gold,
because
that
would
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
drafters,
just
as
in
the
constitutional
sense
judge
kaufman
has
said
that
we
should
not
freeze
the
constitution
in
1787,
i
think,
we
should
not
freeze
the
warsaw
convention.
the
duty
of
this
court
is
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
treaty's
drafters
in
the
light
of
changing
circumstances
and
in
the
light
of
the
subsequent
conduct.
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
parties
to
me
is
very
clear,
your
honor.
they
have
stated
that
the
limit
should
be
in
the
area
of
$20
per
kilogram.
i
should
think
it
is
the
duty
of
this
court
to
effectuate
that
intent.
mr.
john
n.
romans
well,
i
suppose
that
everybody
could
become
a
very
sophisticated
person,
and
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
adopt
these
kinds
of
things,
buy
and
sell
gold
futures.
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
add
to
the
price
of
everything,
but
yes,
that
would
be
a
way
out.
you
could
hedge
every
single
transaction
you
made
by
buying
gold
futures.
but
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
you
correctly
stated
that
we
are...
a
court's
duty
is
not
to
decide
what
value
should
be
made.
that
is
the
job
of
the
legislature
and
treaty
partners.
and
this
court
is,
of
course,
duty
bound
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
the
drafters.
thank
you
very
much.
