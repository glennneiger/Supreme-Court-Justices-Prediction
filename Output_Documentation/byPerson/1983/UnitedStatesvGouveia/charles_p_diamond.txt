mr.
charles
p.
diamond
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
time
allotted
to
me
to
address
the
right
to
counsel
issue
i
would
like
to
make
four
principal
points
concerning
the
decision
below.
first,
the
decision
does
not
limit
the
right
of
the
government
to
order
an
inmate
into
segregated
confinement
or
to
hold
him
there
indefinitely.
it
simply
recognizes
that
under
limited
circumstances
an
inmate
can
be
rendered
an
accused
by
that
confinement
and
under
limited
circumstances
is
entitled
to
counsel.
the
government
does
not
point
to
any
adverse
consequences
which
could
flow
from
that
decision.
point
two,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
fully
accommodates
the
interests
of
the
government
in
responding
promptly
to
disruptive
events.
indeed,
it
only
pertains
to
those
who
have
been
held
under
bureau
of
prisons'
own
regulations
to
answer
in
a
pending
criminal
indictment.
in
that
respect,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
far
less
rigorous
than
standards
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
american
bar
association
and
other
legal
groups.
point
three.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
require
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
all
inmates
confined
in
administrative
detention
for
more
than
90
days.
contrary
to
what
mr.
frey
says
about
this
case,
this
case
concerns
only
inmates
who
have
been
detained
to
answer
in
pending
criminal
charges
and
thus
who
in
a
constitutional
sense
have
been
accused
of
a
crime.
point
four.
the
decision
below
does
not
represent
any
radical
departure
from
anything.
it
simply
stands
for
the
proposition
that
those
arrested
within
the
walls
of
a
prison
are
as
much
entitled
to
legal
representation
as
those
who
are
arrested
outside
the
walls
of
an
institution.
in
light
of
mr.
frey's
comments,
i'd
like
to
diverge
from
the
order
in
which
i
was
going
to
cover
these
points
and
plunge
right
into
the
constitutional
basis
for
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
that
really
goes
to
the
third
point
that
i
wanted
to
cover
this
morning
in
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
a
right
to
counsel
only
in
inmates
who
have
been
held
in
a
constitutional
sense
because
they
have
been
accused
of
a
crime.
what
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
were
the
bureau
of
prison
regulations
which
state
an
inmate
can
be
detained
indefinitely...
and
in
this
case
we
have
up
to
20
months
of
detention...
without
a
lawyer
while
he
is
pending
criminal
investigation
and
trial
for
a
criminal
act
committed
in
the
institution.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
he
would
have
remained
within
his
general
population
at
the
lompoc
penitentiary.
he
would
not
have
been
confined,
or
these
individuals
would
not
have
been
confined
in
three
by
five-foot
cells
for
23-1/2
hours
a
day
for
20
months
without
anyone
to
do
anything
about
the
charges
that
everybody
knew
was
coming
down
the
pike.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
in
limited
circumstances
they
had
limited
access
to
make
telephone
calls.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
that
was
the
extent
to
which
they
could
communicate
with
the
outside
world,
coupled
with
the
potential
of
having
visits,
if
a
visitor
showed
up
to
see
them.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
i'm
sorry.
also
they
had
the
right
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world
by
mail.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
yes.
but
with
respect
to
communications
within
the
inmate
population,
and
that
is
where
the
body
of
witnesses
that
would
have
been
available
to
build
a
defense
on
their
behalf
resided,
they
had
absolutely
no
means
of
communication
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
illustrations
that
mr.
frey
points
out.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
believe
it
is
at
all
contrary
to
the
kirby
case.
indeed,
mr.
kirby,
in
the
kirby
case,
was
arrested,
but
the
crucial
fact,
in
our
opinion,
that
makes
kirby
much
different
than
this
case
is
that
he
was
not
detained
to
answer,
and
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
kirby
in
greater
depth.
but
i
want
to
refer
to--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--that
is
the
words
that
this
court
used
in
united
states
v.
marion,
reaffirmed
four
years
later
in
dillingham
v.
united
states,
to
define
when
for
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment
a
criminal
prosecution
commences.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
that
decision
was
the
following
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment:
"in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right.
"
the
sixth
amendment
proceeds
to
list
and
identify
various
rights
that
are
enjoyed
by
an
accused,
but
marion
dealt
with
what
does
it
mean
to
be
an
accused,
what
constitutes
an
accusation
during
the
course
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
justice
rehnquist,
they're
not
at
all
inconsistent,
and
let
me
explain
why.
let
me
first
state
that
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
found
these
individuals
entitled
to
counsel
or
at
least
accused
in
a
constitutional
sense
was
because
they
were
detained
to
be
held
to
answer
in
a
pending
charge.
what
was
the
situation--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--we
conducted...
that
was
the
principal
issue,
justice
white,
that
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
before
judge
gray,
who
dismissed
the
indictments
in
this
case
originally.
what
we
had
were
detention
orders
which
recited
the
fact
that
these
individuals
were
committed
to
administrative
detention
on
the
nights
of
the
crimes,
and
this
pertains
to
my
clients,
mr.
mills
and
mr.
pierce;
we
have
an
analogous
proceeding
in
the
other
case.
but
those
detention
orders
recited
the
fact
that
the
individuals
had
been
put
in
adu
because
of
the
pending
criminal
investigation
and
the
pending
criminal
trial.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
marion...
i'll
try
to
answer
this
question
then
i'd
like
to
return
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
marion's
use
of
the
term
"holding
to
answer"
does
not
mean
that
there
has
to
be
a
charge,
a
formal
charge,
on
file.
in
fact,
the
court,
in
marion,
stated--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--kirby
is
readily
explained
by
a
number
of
facts.
number
one,
it
dealt
principally
with
the
question
of
whether
to
extent
the
wade-gilbert
exclusionary
rule
to
retain
police
show-ups
conducted
upon
arrest.
in
a
constitutional
sense--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--that
is
correct.
but
justice
stewart's
comments,
as
i
recall,
commanded
four
votes.
but
i
would
like
to
deal
with
justice
stewart's
comments
and
the
result
reached
by
justice
stewart
as
they
would
apply
to
this
case.
marion
tells
us
that
if
one
is
accused
in
a
constitutional
sense,
that
the
sixth
amendment
becomes
operable
in
the
first
instance
if
one
suffers
the
imposition
and
actual
restraints,
and
the
holding
to
answer.
marion
makes
clear
that--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--a
decision
to
bring
the
guy
into
the
stationhouse
and
not
cut
him
loose
and
let
him
go
home,
to
hold
him
there--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--it's
an
arrest
and
a
decision
to
keep
him
there
until
something
happens.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
he
has
been
held
to
answer
a
charge
that
the
prosecutors
are
preparing
to
bring
against
him.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
but,
justice--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--justice
rehnquist,
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
tries
to
tie
the
concept
of
holding
to
answer
into
the
procedure
that
we
have.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
i
understand
that.
but
my
point
is
how
could
marion
have
referred
to
a
procedure
in
which
a
magistrate
determines
probable
cause
and
binds
someone
over
when
it
was
decided
in
1971
and
wasn't
until
1975
in
gerstein
v.
pugh
that
this
court
for
the
first
time
recognized
that
one
arrested
had
a
right
to
go
through
that
process.
beyond
that,
what
that
argument
reduces
to
is
that
the
police
can
go
out
on
the
street
and
they
can
throw
somebody
in
the
hoosegow,
and
if
they
decide
not
to
bring
him
before
a
magistrate
or,
in
this
case,
since
the
rules
don't
apply,
don't
have
to,
he
has
not
been
held
to
answer.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
let
me
attempt
to
distinguish
kirby,
because
i
think
it
is
distinguishable
from
the
situation
that
marion
addressed,
it's
distinguishable
from
the
situation
here.
the
problem
in
kirby
or
what
happened
in
kirby
was
an
individual
was,
mr.
kirby
was
taken
off
the
street,
largely
because
the
police
thought
he
was
somebody
else,
and
he
was
in
possession
of,
as
i
recall,
traveler's
checks
with
somebody
else's
name
in
it,
and
they
thought
that
was
suspicious
and
they
brought
him
to
the
station
house
for
further
investigation.
they
get
to
the
station
house
and
for
the
first
time
the
police
learn
that
the
man
whose
traveler's
checks
he
was
carrying
was
the
victim
of
a
robbery.
well,
it's
not
unlawful
to
carry
those
traveler's
checks
and
in
fact
mr.
kirby
had
an
explanation
for
that.
they
had
made
no
decision
to
hold
him
to
answer.
the
police
went
out
and
got
the
victim,
brought
him
in,
and
conducted
an
uncounseled
lineup.
it
wasn't
until
after
that
uncounseled
lineup
that
they
decided
to
hold
mr.
kirby
for
the
robbery
charge.
at
the
time
kirby
was
subjected
to
the
uncounseled
lineup,
he
had--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--no,
it
wasn't
until
then
that
they
decided
to
hold
him
until
a
charge
could
be
filed.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
justice
marshall,
we
believe
that
an
inmate
detained
under
these
circumstances
plainly
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer
sooner
than
20
months
after
he
is
isolated.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
we
seen
the
principle
emerging
from
the
sixth
amendment
cases
that
an
individual
must
be
afforded
representation
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
following
arrest.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--certainly
it
can't
be
indictment,
because
that
means
the
door
is
limitless
and
there's
no
right
to
counsel
under
these
circumstances.
i
think
a
proper
benchmark
might
well
be
the
rules
that
apply
outside
the
prison
population.
in
virtually...
in
all
the
states--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
--within
90
days
after
the
inmate
is
confined.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
justice
marshall,
that
is
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
about
time,
in
part.
it's
about
20
months
of
isolation.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
that
is
correct
under
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
charles
p.
diamond
that
is
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
and
in
that
respect
we
endorse
that
principle.
what
this
case
is
analogous
to,
not
kirby,
because
kirby
is
distinguishable
on
the
constitutional
basis
that
there
was
not
a
holding
to
answer.
the
case
is
analogous
to
situations
which
rarely
arise
in
this
nation
of
an
individual
arrested
and
then
detained
for
an
unconscionably
long
period
of
time
without
a
lawyer.
those
cases
are
indeed
rare
under
our
system
of
justice
because
nowhere
in
this
country
can
an
individual
be
arrested
without
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
having
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him.
but
in
the
rare
case
in
which
that
has
arisen
the
courts
have
uniformly
condemned
that
result.
one
example
was
chism
v.
koehler,
and
only
one
of
two
examples
in
the
federal
system
that
we
were
able
to
find,
in
which
mr.
chism
was
arrested
and
then
forced
to
litigate
for
the
next
15
months
as
to
whether
he
had
the
right
to
appointed
counsel
in
the
first
place.
the
court
there
in
reversing
the
convictions...
and
this
is
the
sixth
circuit
adopting
the
language
of
the
district
court...
noted
in
three
sentences
the
unfairness
of
the
situation.
the
court
said:
"during
the
15
months
that
petitioner
was
incarcerated
without
the
assistance
of
trial
counsel
there
was
no
one
to
gather
and
preserve
evidence
which
might
have
been
favorable
to
the
defense.
"
"meanwhile
the
state
was
proceeding
in
the
case
with
all
the
investigating
expertise
and
resources
at
its
disposal.
"
"such
an
imbalance
strikes
the
very
essence
of
even-handed
criminal
justice.
"
it
is
precisely
that
situation
of
which
we
are
complaining
in
this
case.
there
was
no
question
but
that
within
hours
in
the
case
of
mills
and
within
weeks
in
the
case
of
the
gouveia
prosecution
that
there
would
be
a
criminal
prosecution...
no
question
whatsoever.
and
we
contend
that
within
a
reasonable
point
an
individual
has
to
be
recognized
for
what
he
is
under
those
circumstances.
he
has
in
effect
been
arrested.
he
has
been
held
to
answer
a
criminal
charge.
one
point
that
i
think
must
be
understood
in
response
to
mr.
frey's
comments,
there
were
no
security
rationales
applicable
in
this
case.
we
had
a
district
court
finding
which
was
concurred
in
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
