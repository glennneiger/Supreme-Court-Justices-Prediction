unknown
speaker
were
they
free
to
communicate
with
the
outside?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
frey.
the
time
of
indictment
is
the
time
for
appointment?
unknown
speaker
out
in
the
hallway.
unknown
speaker
but
fear
was
part
of
the
administrative
detention
for
the
security
of
other
inmates
and
staff
of
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
that
expressed
in
the
process?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you,
you
make
a
very
major
point
out
of
the
reason
for
the
detention
being
security
rather
than
investigation.
would
the
issue
before
us
be
different
if
it
were
for
investigative
purposes
after
the
90
days?
unknown
speaker
the
issue...
i
mean,
is
this
critical
to
your
case?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
would
be
very
relevant
if
there
were
a
suit
for
damages
for
being
detained
for
too
long
or
something
like
that,
but
under
your
sixth
amendment
analysis
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
it
makes
any
difference
why
they
were
detained.
unknown
speaker
but
your
central
response,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
no
sixth
amendment
right
attaches
no
matter
what
the
reason
for
the
detention.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
prisoners
weren't
going
anywhere
anyway,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
going
to
remain
in
custody
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
claim
of
some
constitutional
right
to
be
in
a
particular
part
of
the
prison
on
the
part
of
these
people?
unknown
speaker
did
the
ninth
circuit
give
any
hint
that
there
was
some
right
to
be
in
a
particular
part
of
the
poison?
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it
that
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
there
wouldn't
be
any
right
to
counsel
either
if
the
day
that
this
prisoner
asked
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
they
just
let
him
out
of
the
control
unit.
unknown
speaker
yes.
they
let
him
out
and
his
right
to
counsel
claim
fails
even
though
the
investigation
goes
on.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
so
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
said
if
you
hold
him
beyond
90
days
it
is
equivalent
to
a--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
really
pretty
well
repudiated
the
reasoning
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
kirby,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
kirby
really
rejected
this
kind
of
functional
equivalent
type
of
analysis
in
this
particular
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
what
they
really
meant
was
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
a
private
investigator.
unknown
speaker
and
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
guarantee
any
right
to
a
private
investigator.
unknown
speaker
then
you
would.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
how
much
of
that
material
was
used?
there
were
disciplinary
hearings,
weren't
there,
and
they
went
through
some
kind
of
determination
that
they
were
involved
in
the
murder?
unknown
speaker
so
some
of
the
evidence
was
disclosed
to
them.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it?
they
didn't
participate?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
even
though
they
don't
make
the
evidence
available
to
him
they
have
formed
a
judgment
that
there
is
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
he
committed
the
murder
in
order
to
impose
discipline.
unknown
speaker
then
if
they
know
this,
i
guess
this
doesn't
relate
to
the
constitutional
issue,
but
what
would
be
wrong
with
giving
him
a
lawyer
at
that
point
then
they
know
they
are
going
to
indict
him
for
murder?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
you
know
you're
going
to
indict
the
man
for
murder.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
don't
indict
him
for
murder,
no
harm
would
be
done.
unknown
speaker
if
there's
a
strong
probability,
if
you've
had
all
these
informants
and
you've
made
a
judgment
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding
that
he
killed
the
person,
there's
a
likelihood
that
he'll
be
indicted
for
murder
and
a
probability
he's
going
to
need
a
lawyer.
why
not
appoint
him?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
so
basically
your
argument
is
well,
it
might
be
a
good
idea,
but
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
wouldn't
it
be
truthful
to
say
that
a
lawyer
can't
do
him
much
good
under
the
rules
in
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
and
perhaps
give
the
lawyer
the
right
to
confer
immunity
on
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
one
thing
he
might
do,
as
sometimes
happens,
he
negotiates
a
plea
agreement,
so
the
whole
thing--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
diamond.
unknown
speaker
where
would
he
have
been
had
there
been
no
murders
or
other
injuries?
unknown
speaker
you
say
he
couldn't
do
anything.
they
did
make
telephone
calls.
unknown
speaker
they
did,
right.
is
there
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
no
letters?
unknown
speaker
and
receive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
diamond,
kirby
was
arrested,
wasn't
he,
before
charges
were
preferred
against
him,
and
the
holding
of
the
court
was
that
even
though
he
was
arrested
it
did
not
bring
into
effect
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
so
even
though
you
establish
that
this
person
was
detained
pending
criminal
charges,
if
you
don't
show
that
there
was
some
sort
of
commencement
of
criminal
prosecution
it
seems
to
me
you're
contrary
to
the
kirby
case.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
"detained
to
answer"?
unknown
speaker
but
they're
talking
there
about
the
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
they
weren't
talking
about
the
right
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
one
were
to
conclude
that
perhaps
the
language
in
marion
pointed
one
way
and
the
language
in
kirby
pointed
another,
kirby
having
dealt
with
right
to
counsel
and
marion
having
dealt
with
speedy
trial?
wouldn't
kirby
govern
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
it
was
then
pending?
that's
just
language.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they
weren't
being...
the
only
time
they
would
be
held
to
answer
a
charge
is
if
the
charge
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
kirby,
like
justice
rehnquist
says?
what
about
kirby?
unknown
speaker
now
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
justice
stewart's
opinion,
as
i
recall
the
case.
that
is
just
justice
powell's
concurrence.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean...
"holding
to
answer"?
unknown
speaker
that's
just
arrest.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
language
in
marion
doesn't
mean
that
he's
being
held
to
answer
a
charge
that's
been
filed?
you
think
it
means
that
he
is
being
held
to
answer
a
charge
if
it's
ever
filed?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
certainly
contrary
to
the
normal
meaning
of
"hold
to
answer"
that
we
learned,
at
least
we
learned
in
the
days
when
i
was
in
law
school,
that
being
held
to
answer
is
going
before
a
magistrate
to
see
if
there's
probable
cause.
if
the
magistrate
says
there's
probable
cause,
you
are
held
to
answer
and
bail
is
set.
unknown
speaker
it
is
inconceivable
you
would
be
held
to
answer
without
there
being
a
charge
to
which
you
are
held
to
answer
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
speak
out
of
my
experience,
not
what
the
solicitor
general
is
trying
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
kirby
says
that
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
implicated
in
those
circumstances.
now
maybe
some
other
constitutional
right
is.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
wasn't
until
then
they
decided
to
file
a
charge
against
him?
unknown
speaker
mr.
diamond,
when
should
he
have
counsel
in
this
case?
what
point
in
time?
unknown
speaker
when?
unknown
speaker
what
is
a
reasonable
time
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
example,
the
government
says
when
he
was
indicted.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
apply
outside
the
prison
population.
unknown
speaker
well,
when?
unknown
speaker
on
the
89th
day?
you're
putting
it
on
time
now,
not
on
condition.
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
been
released
on
the
89th
day,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
are
urging
us
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
levine.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
"works"...
that
avoids
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
have
a
remedy
that
affects
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
there's
been
a
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
help
you
to
prove
that
there's
a
right
to
counsel
when
you
say
you
don't
get
these
kinds
of
remedies.
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
telephoned
you
with
respect
to
these
matters?
unknown
speaker
could
the
clients
that
you're
now
representing
have
telephoned
you
and
got
advice
over
the
telephone
or
by
visits
which
were
allowed?
unknown
speaker
how
much
better
off
with
respect
to
being
able
to
prepare
his
defense
would
he
have
been
in
the
general
prison
population
than
in
the
control
unit?
unknown
speaker
because
i
guess
you
can
see
that
if
he
had
been
released
to
the
control
unit
he
could
have
asked
for
counsel
forever
and
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
it,
even
if
he
was
indigent.
unknown
speaker
until
there
had
been
a
charge
filed.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
not
going
to
get
an
attorney
appointed
for
him,
so
what
does
he
do
to
help
himself?
unknown
speaker
so
he's...
when
he's
in
the
general
prison
population
he
is
going
to
be
conducting,
gathering
these
facts
himself?
unknown
speaker
he
also
has
the
right
to
be
killed.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
back
up
a
minute.
you
said
that
if
he
could
afford
a
lawyer
he
could
get
one,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
would
a
lawyer
be
able
to
go
out
and
talk
to
all
the
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
would
he
be
able
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
like
two
or
three?
unknown
speaker
there
are
opportunities,
but
i
mean
every
prisoner
out
there
is
going
to
have
a
lawyer
going
around
talking
to
the
prisoners?
who
is
going
to
run
the
jail?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
what
was
said
earlier.
you
don't
want
a
lawyer,
you
want
an
investigator.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
a
lawyer
that
would
go
down
into
the
prison
yard
and
talk
to
prisoners
at
random?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
you
did?
unknown
speaker
but
you
weren't
paid?
unknown
speaker
this
was
done
by
the
paid
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
you
said
out
in
the
yard?
i
thought
these
people
were
in
administrative
detention.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
those
who
were
not
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
levine,
you
succeeded
in
producing
a
large
number
of
witnesses,
did
you
not,
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
how
many
witnesses
from
the
former
prison
population
were
you
able
to
produce?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
you
get
into
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
there
had
been
a
release
after
90
days
into
the
general
prison
population.
you
don't
claim
then
there
would
have
been
any
right
to
an
appointment
of
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
and
so
he
would
then
have
had
to
proceed
on
his
own?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
even
with
the
risks
that
might
be
attendant
and
were
thought
to
attend
such
a
release
into
the
general
population?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
there
are
some
rather
unusual
difficulties
in
investigating
this
kind
of
case,
as
you
have
said
it
was
for
you,
and
that
those
difficulties
would
also
attend
the
government's
inquiry
to
try
to
get
information
from
these
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
it's
also
safe,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
these
defendants
charged
with
murder
had
these
long
life
sentences?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
if
one
of
these
people
had
plenty
of
money
and
apart
from
prison
regulations,
would
he
have
had
a
constitutional
right
to
retain
counsel
of
his
choice
before
indictment?
unknown
speaker
or
some
other
reason
to
hold
them
in
confinement...
i
mean,
in
control
units.
unknown
speaker
or
under
the
control
unit.
i
suppose
the
security
problem
could
exist
for
a
long
time.
