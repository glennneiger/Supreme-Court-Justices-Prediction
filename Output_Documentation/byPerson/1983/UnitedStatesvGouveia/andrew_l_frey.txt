mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
court
has
under
review
a
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
reversing
respondents'
convictions
for
brutal
murders
committed
while
they
were
inmates
at
the
federal
correctional
institution
in
lompos,
california,
and
ordering
dismissal
of
the
indictments
against
them
on
the
ground
that
they
were
denied
their
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
when
they
were
held
in
administrative
detention
for
more
than
90
days
after
the
killings,
when
that
detention
was,
in
the
court's
view,
based
in
part
on
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
investigation
by
the
fbi
for
the
murders.
now
essentially
while
there
are
differences
in
the
case,
the
two
groups
of
cases,
the
gouveia
group
and
the
mills
group,
followed
a
similar
pattern.
there
was
a
murder.
either
immediately
after
the
murder
or
within
several
weeks
thereafter
the
respondents
who
were
inmates
at
the
prison
were
confined
in
administrative
detention.
within
several
weeks
of
that
prison
disciplinary
hearings
were
held
and
they
were
adjudicated
to
have
violated
the
prison
regulations
against
murder.
they
were
then
confined
in
the
administrative
detention
unit
until
the
time
they
were
indicted,
some
months
later.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
free
to
make
phone
calls
to
the
outside,
to
lawyers
or
to
others.
in
fact,
two
of
the
individuals
involved
called
the
public
defender
and
asked
for
their
assistance
and
were
told
that
they
couldn't
because
they
had
not
yet
been
indicted.
so
they
were
free
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world,
including
communicating
with
lawyers.
they
were
eventually
indicted,
and
at
that
point
they
were
transferred
for
trial.
in
the
mills
case,
motions
to
dismiss
were
made
and
although
the
ground
that
is
now
the
issue
before
the
court
was
not
raised
by
respondents
mills
and
pierce
the
district
court
in
granting
the
motion
said
that
their
right
to
counsel
had
been
denied
and
dismissed
the
indictment
on
that
ground,
among
others.
the
government
took
an
interlocutory
appeal.
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
for
trial.
in
the
gouveia
case,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
relief
in
which
all
the
grounds
that
had
been
relied
on
by
the
district
court
in
mills
were
raised
by
the
gouveia
group
of
defendants.
and
in
mills
there
was
one
trial
after
the
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals;
the
defendants
were
convicted
and
appealed.
in
gouveia
there
was
a
trial
that
resulted
in
a
hung
jury
as
to
the
present
respondents,
an
acquittal
of
co-defendant
flores,
and
an
acquittal
of
respondent
reynoso
on
one
lesser
count.
those
defendants
also
appealed.
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
and
heard
by
an
en
banc
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
held
that
the
convictions
should
be
reversed
and
the
indictments
dismissed.
now
as
we
see
it,
the
case
presents
one
primary
and
one
secondary
issue.
the
primary
issue
is
whether
respondents'
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
amendment
attached
prior
to
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
judicial
proceedings
against
them
by
indictment.
if
this
court
disagrees
with
the
ninth
circuit
and
finds,
as
we
urge,
that
the
right
to
counsel
did
not
attach
prior
to
that
time,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
their
right
to
counsel
attached,
then
there
would
be
the
further
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
this
particular
case,
the
time
of
indictment
is
the
time
that
we
say
that
the
right
of
appointment
of
counsel
attaches,
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
and
for
indigents
appointment
of
counsel.
now
given
the
time
limitations,
i'd
like
to
focus
my
attention
in
my
opening
argument
on
the
primary
issue
of
the
attachment
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
now
the
first
and
most
obvious
point
about
the
attachment
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
that
it
does
derive
from
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
sixth
amendment
says
in
any
criminal
prosecution
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
there
must
be,
then,
something
that
the
court
can
say
is
a
criminal
prosecution
before,
i
think,
the
court
can
legitimately
say
that
the
right
defined
in
the
sixth
amendment
has
attached.
the
second
obstacle
to
respondents'
position
and
the
court
of
appeals
position
is
that
this
court
has
a
consistent
line
of
decisions
in
which
it
has
recognized
the
significance
of
the
need
for
their
to
be
a
prosecution
in
existence,
and
it
has
in
the
context
of
miranda
as
against
massiah
rights
or
in
the
context
of
whether
a
lineup
without
counsel
claim
or
presents
a
due
process
or
a
right
to
counsel
claim,
it
has
consistently
looked
at
the
question
whether
there
is
some
kind
of
charge
against
the
defendant
charging
him
with
the
crime
filed
in
a
court
somewhere.
of
course,
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
remotely
like
that.
the
sole
exception
to
this
line
of
cases
is
the
escobedo
case,
which
the
court
has
subsequently
held
to
be
limited
to
its
facts
and
plainly
rejected
in
its
rationale
in
the
later
decisions.
and
i
would
just
point
out
about
escobedo
that
that
was
a
case
that
at
least
directly
involved
an
interference
by
the
police
between
the
defendant
and
his
retained
counsel,
who
was
down
at
the
station
house
trying
to
to
get
in
to
see
him
and
was
not
permitted
to
see
him
while
he
was
being
interrogated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
so
it's
understandable,
perhaps,
that
the
court
thought
the
right
to
counsel
would
be
relevant
there,
although
i
think
subsequently
doctrinally
it's
become
quite
clear
that
it
wasn't.
now,
as
i
said,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
there
was
nothing
resembling
a
formal
judicial
charge
of
any
kind
prior
to
indictment,
and
the
rule
has
been,
i
think,
fairly
clear
and
fairly
easy
to
administer
as
to
when
sixth
amendment
rights
attach.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
has
basically
thrown
us
into
seas
of
uncertainty
by
developing
a
concept
of
the
functional
equivalency
of
a
prosecution
or
an
accusation,
and
stating
that
"whether
a
person
stands
accused"...
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
opinion...
"can
only
be
determined
from
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
"
now
i
hope
this
court
will
decline
the
invitation
to
set
sail
in
these
murky
waters.
now
let's...
let
me
talk
for
a
minute
about
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
would
satisfy
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
that
there
be
a
prosecution
in
being
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
formal
accusation
of
the
defendants
for
a
crime.
it
held
that
the
retention
in
administrative
detention
unit
for
more
than
90
days,
where
part
of
the
reason
for
that
detention
is
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
investigation.
now
respondents
mills
and
pierce,
perhaps
fearing
that
the
court
would
find
the
breadth
of
that
rule
somewhat
difficult
to
accept,
have
proposed
a
considerably
narrower
principle.
they
assert
that
the
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
only
that
where
people
are
detained
more
than
90
days
with
no
legitimate
security
purpose
but
solely
because
of
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
investigation
by
the
fbi,
then
they
should
be
considered
accused
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
administrative
detention
is
for,
is
for
purposes
of
security,
and
i
do--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
is
some...
there
is
some
controversy
over
exactly
what
the
record
shows
or
what
the
court
of
appeals
could
decide.
i
might
point
out
that
the
time
that
mills
and
pierce
made
their
motions
in
the
district
court
the
only
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
claim
that
they
made
was
a
claim
that
they
were
entitled
to
have
counsel
there
the
day
that
they
were
arrested,
when
their
physical
wounds
were
examined,
and
when
evidence
was
seized
from
their
person.
there
was
no
claim
that
they
were
deprived
of
their
right
to
counsel
during
the
period
of
detention,
and
there
was
really
no
focus
during
the
hearings
on
the
pretrial
motions
on
the
question
of
why
they
were
being
detained,
although
there
was
considerable
focus
in
both
cases
on
the
consequences
of
detention
in
terms
of
the
difficulty
of
ultimately
mounting
a
defense.
the
result
is
that
the
record
contains
very
little
as
to
why
they
were
detained,
but
it
does
contain
forms
that
state
that
the
reason
that
they
were
detained
was
for
the
security
of
the
institution
and
the
safety
of
inmates
within
the
institution.
some
of
those
forms
also
indicate
that
they
were...
there
are
boxes
that
can
be
checked
off
and
the
pendency
of
a
criminal
investigation
was
also
a
reason
given
on
those
forms.
now,
when
the
case
went
up
to
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
government's
appeal,
that
was
the
first
time
that
this
question
of
why
they
were
being
detained,
whether
it
was
for
security
purposes
or
others,
was
brought
into
focus
by
the
parties,
and
at
that
point
the
panel
simply
said
the
evidence
shows
that
they
were
kept
in
for
security
purposes.
and,
more
than
that...
and
this
is
a
point
where
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
fundamental
error...
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
the
bureau's
regulations
and
the
regulation
that's
relevant
is
at
section
541.22
of
title
28,
cfr.
the
regulation
says
that
people
can
be
retained,
placed
in
administrative
detention
when
the
inmate's
continued
presence
in
the
general
population
poses
a
serious
threat
to
life,
property,
self,
staff,
other
inmates,
or
to
the
security
or
orderly
running
of
the
institution,
and
when
the
inmate...
and
then
it
lists
six
factors,
including
the
pendency
of
an
investigation
or
trial
for
a
criminal
act,
the
pendency
of
a
transfer,
and
several
other
factors.
these
regulations
mean
that
an
inmate
cannot
be
held
in
administrative
detention
except
where
there
is
a
finding
that
releasing
him
into
the
general
population
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
security
of
the
institution.
the
only
exception
for
that
holdover
is
inmates
who
are
in
transit
from
one
institution
to
another
and
are
being
held
waiting
for
the
next
bus,
and
they
can
be
held
and
customarily
are
in
administrative
detention
without
a
finding
of
security
need.
so
under
the
regulations
they
cannot
be
held
except
on
the
basis
of
a
security
need.
and
i
might
say
that
in
this
case
it
does
not
take
a
great
deal
of
imagination
to
see
the
security
reasons.
the
prison
authorities
had
found
that
these
people
had
committed
brutal
murders.
to
return
these
inmates
to
the
general
population
at
lompoc
was,
i
think,
totally
out
of
the
question
both
in
terms
of
the
safety
of
these
inmates
themselves,
who
might
be
subject
to
retaliation
by
friends
of
the
deceased,
and
in
terms
of
the
safety
of
potential
government
witnesses
or
informants
or
people
who
they
might
think
are
government
witnesses
or
informants.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
so
the
one
thing
that
i
think
clearly
was
not
going
to
happen
ever
with
these
people
was
to
return
them
to
the
general
population
at
lompoc.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
of
course--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--let
me
put
it
this
way.
certainly
in
our
view
it
is
not
critical
to
our
case.
in
our
view,
our
first
argument...
and
we
think
the
precedents
of
the
court
clearly
support
it...
is
there
has
to
be
in
some
court
somewhere
something
that
resembles
a
charge
of
a
crime
before
the
sixth
amendment
attaches,
and
all
of
the
rest
of
this
is
irrelevant...
functional
equivalent
analysis
or
symbolic--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
responding
to
the
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
rationale
of
my
brother
who
you
will
hear
from.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true,
but
i
am
now
in
this
portion
of
the
argument
trying
to
address
the
question
whether
if
there
were
a
some
functional
equivalency
or
symbolic
accusation
rationale
that
would
be
acceptable,
whether
this
case
would
satisfy
the
requirement.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
were
going
somewhere.
they
were
going
to
the
control
unit
in
marion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there's
no
question
that
they
were
going
to
be
in
custody.
the
question
is
whether
they
were
going
to
be
in
custody
in
the
general
population
at
lompoc,
the
administrative
detention
unit
at
lompoc,
or
someplace
else.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
that
would
be
an
issue...
i
mean,
if
we
are
talking
about
it
as
a
matter
of
due
process
liberty
interest,
that
would
be
an
issue
that
would
require
application
of
the
principles
of
hewitt
v.
helms,
decided
last
term,
to
the
particular
regulations
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
but
that's
not
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling.
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
is
that
they
were
held
in
administrative
detention.
one
of
the
reasons,
and
that's
why
i
emphasize
that
it
was
conjunctive...
you
have
to
find
that
they
are
a
threat
to
the
security
of
the
institution,
but
the
bureau
has
framed
the
regulations
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
give
the
warden
simply
essentially
standardless
authority.
he
must
find
not
only
that
they
are
a
threat,
but
also
that
one
of
six
other
conditions
exists.
one
of
them
is
that
he
is
pending
criminal
investigation
or
trial.
one
of
them
is
that
he
is
pending
transfer.
now
in
the
case
of
all
these
inmates,
and
i
have
to
emphasize
that
the
record
is
incomplete,
we
have
supplied
certain
forms
that
we
have
retrieved
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
recently
and
lodged
them
with
the
clerk.
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
if
there
were
a
hearing
on
this
question
it
could
be
established
that
these
inmates
were
being
held
both...
always
for
security
reasons,
always
because
there
was
a
determination
that
it
was
dangerous
to
return
them
to
the
general
population.
but,
in
addition,
in
order
to
meet
the
other
second
independent
requirement
because
they
were
awaiting
transfer
and
because
there
was
a
criminal
investigation.
but
the
point
that's
relevant
to
this
case
is
if
there
had
been
no
criminal
investigation
pending,
they
would
not
have
been
released
into
the
general
population
at
lompoc.
they
were
still
awaiting
transfer
to
the
marion
facilities.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
clear,
or
indeed
they
said
he
could
be
held
for
90
days
and
then
let
out
of
the
control
unit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
investigation
against
him
goes
on.
but
their
point
is
that
the
detention
is
like
an
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
they
rely
on
the
sixth
amendment
speedy
trial
cases
that
discuss
arrest.
now
there
is,
i
think,
some
language
that
is
debatable
in
some
of
those
cases,
but
you
have
to
recognize
that
in
speedy
trial
cases...
marion
originally
formulated
in
terms
of
the
attachment
of
the
speedy
trial
right
is
when
you
are
arrested
and
held
to
answer
criminal
charges.
subsequent
cases
like
dillingham
talk
about
arrest,
but
the
point
is
that
arrest
alone,
as
macdonald
makes
clear,
is
not
enough
to
trigger
sixth
amendment
rights
or,
if
it
does,
they
get
untriggered
the
minute
you're
let
out
with
no
criminal
charges
pending
against
you.
it
is
the
pendency
of
criminal
charges
that
activate,
that
satisfy
the
sixth
amendment
requirement
that
there
be
a
prosecution.
an
arrest
is
not
a
prosecution.
that's
what
kirby
held.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
a
symbolic
accusation
or
a
functional
equivalent
of
an
accusation,
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
would
be
our
view
i
don't
think
it
can
stand
against
the
plurality
opinion
in
kirby
or
the
later
cases
that
draw
this
distinction...
i
mean,
ash
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it's
true
that
kirby
must
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
arrest
doesn't
cause
the
attachment
of
sixth
amendment
rights,
but
what
kirby
is
relevant
to
is
a
somewhat
different
point.
the
respondents
have
a
quite
different
reason
for
saying
the
sixth
amendment
attached
here,
and
that
is
a
reason
that
says
it
would
be
awfully
helpful
to
have
a
lawyer
in
terms
of
preparing
a
defense.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
exactly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
you
were
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--then
the
next
claim
would
be
that
if
you
have
a
right
of
preindictment
investigation
you
have
to
then
have
a
constitutional
right
to
enforce
that
through
court
orders
requiring
access
to
the
prosecution's
evidence.
a
lot
is
made
in
this
case
of
the
lack
of
access
to
physical
evidence
being
prejudicial
to
the
preparation
of
the
possible
defense
in
the
event
these
people
are
indicted.
well,
i
can
assure
that
unless
a
court
orders
it
the
defendant's
lawyer
would
not
be
given
access
to
the
bag
with
the
name
sanchez
that
was
found
in
the
victim's
cell,
the
blood
samples,
all
those
other
things.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
were
disciplinary
hearings
and
they
were
found
to
be
involved
in
the
murder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
that's
one
of
the
features
that
is
the...
perhaps
the
most
salient
feature
about
prison
disciplinary
hearings
is
the
non-disclosure
of
evidence
that
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
allows,
i
mean,
for
instance,
the
non-disclosure
of
witnesses.
one
reason
why
the
prison
authorities
can
in
many
cases
promptly
determine
the
guilt
of
somebody
but
the
prosecuting
authorities
it
may
take
them
a
long
time,
if
ever,
to
make
a
prosecutable,
indictable
case,
is
because
the
prison
authorities
can
rely
on
informants
whose
identity
is
never
disclosed,
so
they
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
right
of
confrontation.
and
they
do
not
disclose
to
the
defendant
the
physical
evidence.
they
give
him
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
they
give
him
an
opportunity
to
call
witnesses,
which
was
declined
in
this
case
by
and
large.
so
they
give
him
an
opportunity
to
present
some
kind
of
a
defense.
they
give
him
a
prison
staff
assistant.
but
they
do
not
give
him
access
to
the
evidence,
and
if
he
had
a
lawyer
appointed
and
the
lawyer
came
to
the
prison
door,
to
the
fbi,
and
said
i'd
like
to
look
at
the
evidence--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
may
be
quite
certain
that
he's
committed
a
murder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
is
wrong
with
giving
him
a
lawyer
at
that
point?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no,
wait
a
minute.
you've
made
a
very
important
step
inadvertently.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
know--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question.
if
this
were
a
legislative
committee,
i
would
be,
i
think,
better
prepared
to
respond
to
that
question.
we've
had
some
material
adduced
by
our
opponents
which
is
properly
addressed
to
a
legislative
committee
about
the
problems
of
lawyers
in
prison.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
say...
i
don't
think
giving
them
a
lawyer
would
be
of
a
great
deal
of
use
to
them.
i
don't
agree
with
the
basic
assumption
that
it's
no
good
to
have
a
lawyer
later
on
and
you
need
one.
in
fact,
going
back
to
the
point
that
justice
rehnquist
made,
it
can't
be
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
you
need
the
specialized
talents
of
a
lawyer
in
this
situation,
which
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
about,
if
it
would
be
a
satisfactory
substitute
for
that
to
let
them
just
back
into
the
prison
population
to
conduct
their
own
investigation.
just
as
you
would
not
say
if
you
had
a
defendant
who
was
arrested
and
indicted
and
released
on
bail
and
then
his
lawyer
became
ill
and
no
substitute
lawyer
was
appointed
for
him
until
the
morning
of
trial,
nobody
would
entertain
a
claim
that
he
was
out
and
he
could
conduct
his
own
investigation,
he
didn't
need
a
lawyer.
the
point
is
that
once
he
is
going
to
be
tried
he
needs
a
lawyer
and
we
supply
him
a
lawyer
at
critical
stages
of
the
investigation.
but
prior
to
that
time
he
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
it
might
be
helpful,
although
our--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
be
hard
for
a
lawyer
to
do
him
a
great
deal
of
good
unless
you're
not
only
going
to
give
him
a
right
to
a
lawyer
but
you're
also
going
to
say
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
lawyer
be
allowed
into
the
institution
to
wander
around,
talk
to
people,
that
he
be
allowed
to
see
the
physical
evidence,
that
he
be
allowed
to
do
a
lot
of
things.
so
you
may
be
biting
off
a
little
more
than
you
can
chew
if
you
start
down
this
road.
now
maybe
that
would
be
a
good
idea,
but
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
mean
i'm
sure
there's
no
limit
to
what
the
lawyers
could
imagine
they
could
have
that
would
be
useful,
and
i
don't
deny
that
in
many
instances
a
lot
of
these
things
would
be
useful.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
such
a
thing
as...
pre-indictment
plea
negotiation
does
go
on,
not
in
a
case
like
this.
i
don't
think
that's
very
practical.
what...
in
the
real
world,
what
happens
is
it's
very
important
to
have
that
indictment
or
information
or
charge
because
that's
when
the
lawyer
knows
what
the
government's
case
is.
at
that
point
he
does
get
some
discovery,
gets
physical
evidence.
he
gets
his
client's
prior
statements.
if
he
starts
doing
a
very
active
investigation
before
then,
one
of
the
reasons
why
it's
not
common
is
he
may
only
put
himself
in
a
position
where
he
is
handicapped
in
representing
his
client
once
he
knows
what
the
government
is
actually
charging
him
with
and
what
his
case
is.
so
even
where
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
attaches
for
purposes
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
a
bail
hearing,
and
so
on,
it
is
simply
not
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
immediately
goes
out
and
starts
investigating
the
case.
they
may
or
they
may
not.
it
may
or
may
not
be
helpful.
our
position
here
does
not
depend
on
any
conclusion
that
it
would
have
been
useless
to
these
respondents
to
have
lawyers,
but
i
think
they
greatly
exaggerate
the
value
that
it
would
have
been
to
them.
now
i
wanted
also
to
make
just
one
other
point,
which
is
that
their
emphasis
on
the
utility
of
a
lawyer,
even
if
you
accept
it,
does
not
put
them
in
any
different
position
from
lots
of
other
people,
such
as
people
who
get
in
a
serious
automobile
accident
and
are
in
a
hospital
for
six
months
while
the
government
is
investigating
their
case,
people
who
are
arrested
on
other
charges.
and
i
believe
mr.
levine
is
going
to
argue
this
morning.
i
am
told
he
had
a
client
who
was
in
precisely
that
situation...
arrested
on
state
charges,
put
in
a
state
prison,
and
meanwhile
a
federal
investigation
was
going
on.
or
if
we
had
let
these
folks
out
of
jail.
if
their
mandatory
release
date
had
come,
they
would
not
have
been
held
in
administrative
detention.
they
would
have
been
released.
they
would
have
been
just
as
unable
to
conduct
an
investigation.
one
other
point
i
wanted
to
make,
and
that
is
that
the
whole
code
of
guilt
rationale
falls
down
if
you
look
at
what
they
did
with
respondent
gouveia.
he
was
transferred
within
90
days
out
of
adu
in
lompoc
and
sent
to
levenworth.
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
being
held
in
adu
as
some
kind
of
symbolic
accusation
of
the
crime
of
murder.
he
was
transferred
to
levenworth,
and
they
still
dismissed
the
indictment
against
him.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
couple
of
things.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
with
mr.
levine
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
murder
case
here,
which
makes
the
seriousness
of
the
remedy
of
dismissal
a
concern.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
they
all.
i'm
not
certain
what
the
sentences
were.
i
assume
they
all
got
life
sentences
for
these
murders.
no,
pierce
in
fact
was,
after
the
indictment
was
dismissed
and
while
the
government
was
appealing,
his
mandatory
release
date
came
up
and
he
was
let
out.
he
robbed
some
banks
in
northern
california
and
he's
in
state
custody
now.
so
if
the
mandatory
release
date
comes,
this
symbolic
accusation
evaporates
and
they
are
let
out
of
prison.
it's
the
prison
authorities
who
decide
to
put
them
in
administrative
detention.
it
is
not
the
fbi
and
not
the
prosecutor.
it
is
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
there
will
be
a
prosecution.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
statement
by
the
assistant
that
as
to
mr.
levine's
client,
mr.
segura,
it
was
only
several
months
before
the
indictment
was
returned
that
he
felt
he
had
a
prosecutable
case.
they
have
based
much
of
their
argument
on
a
witness
named
giffin,
an
individual
named
giffin,
who
gave
us
information
about
the
murders,
who
was
going
to
be
our
main
witness,
and
he
didn't
testify
at
trial.
fortunately
mr.
kinard,
one
of
the
co-defendants
did,
but
we
would
not
have
had
a
case.
these
cases
are
very
fragile.
we
may
be
quite
confident
that
people
are
guilty,
but
that
is
not
enough
to
justify
returning
an
indictment.
we
have
to
be
able
to
secure
convictions.
i
wanted
to
make
one
point
about
the
district
court's
finding
with
regard
to
the
lack
of
a
security
basis
for
the
detention
of
these
people.
that
is
tucked
away
in
a
conclusion
of
law,
not
a
finding
of
fact.
it
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case
at
all
until
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
was
really
raised
by
mr.
diamond,
refuted
by
us
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
our
favor
and
said
there
was
a
security
basis,
which,
as
i
say,
under
the
regulations
has
to
be
there,
and
under
the...
what
evidence
there
was
showed
that
there
was
a
security
basis.
now
it
is
true
that
they
were
under
investigation
for
a
crime.
we
don't
deny
that.
we
do
deny,
however,
if
there
were
a
hearing
i
think
we
could
plainly
establish
that
that
was
not
a
necessary
condition
for
their
detention.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
kind
of
discussed
that
a
little
bit
back
in
december
in
the
flanagan
case,
but
that
would
sound
to
me
something
like
a
substantive
due
process
right,
and
i
am
not
sure
what
this
court
would
find.
there
would
be
a
decent
argument,
i
think,
that
if
somebody
wants
to
retain
a
lawyer
it
is
the
kind
of
associational
interest
in
running
one's
own
affairs
that
the
government
could
no
arbitrarily
interfere
with
or
prevent.
the
point
about
the
gulag
business,
about
holding
people
indefinitely
without
a
lawyer,
of
course,
raises
a
due
process
claim.
you
can't
hold
people
indefinitely,
not
because
of
their
right
to
counsel
but
because
they
can't
be
deprived
of
their
liberty
without
due
process.
so,
therefore,
in
order
to
hold
them
there
must
be
a
charge
and
a
judicial
findings
and
a
judicial
proceeding.
there
is
none
of
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
could
be
confined
in
a
mental
institution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
want
to
make
a
point.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
that
holding
them
in
adu
was
equivalent
to
an
arrest
because
it
serves
the
important
need
of
investigative
officers
to
protect
witnesses
and
evidence,
facilitate
an
effective
investigation,
prevent
further
criminal
activity
by
the
suspect.
and
it
said
these
are
the
interests
that
lead
to
an
arrest.
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
it
forgot
about
bail.
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
an
arrest.
that
is
preventive
detention.
we
don't
generally
have
that
in
this
country.
most
arrests
are
not
for
the
purpose
of
preventive
detention,
but
they
may
lead
to
the
institution
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
that
is
a
different
story.
in
this
case
we
do
have
preventive
detention
which
is
perfectly
legitimate
in
the
context
of
the
prison
situation.
it
is
not
an
accusation
of
a
crime.
there
is
no
prosecution.
no
right
to
counsel.
thank
you.
