mr.
joel
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
address
my
comments
for
the
most
part
to
what
mr.
frey
has
referred
to
as
the
secondary
issue,
and
i
will
attempt
to
first
agree
with
one
thing
that
he
said.
it
is
a
secondary
issue,
the
issue
being
the
remedy
that
was
fashioned
by
the
ninth
circuit,
only
in
the
sense
that
if
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
as
has
been
discussed
by
mr.
diamond,
then
there
is
really
no
need
to
discuss
what
the
remedy
should
be.
however,
i
think
as
a
prefatory
remark
i
should
state
to
the
court
that
if
there
were
no
prejudice
as
pervasive
as
existed
in
this
case
there
would
be
no
need
for
us
all
to
be
standing
here
discussing
whether
the
right
to
counsel
should
apply.
and
as
we
weave
our
way
through
ten
appellate
briefs
and
the
oral
arguments
that
have
been
heard
here
today
i
think
that
one
thing
becomes
apparent,
and
that
is
throughout
all
those
arguments
nobody
has
suggested
an
alternate
remedy
that
works.
there
are
cases
which
this
court
has
considered
down
through
the
years,
where
the--
mr.
joel
levine
--well,
hopefully
so,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
specifically
speaking
about
is
remedies
such
as
suppression
of
a
statement
or
suppression
of
part
of
a
government's...
of
the
government's
evidence.
that
was
briefly
spoken--
mr.
joel
levine
--well,
my
point
is
that
there
can
be
no
other
remedy
on
this
type
of
a
case
other
than
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
these
other
remedies
that
i
am
attempting
to
just
illustrate
to
the
court
would
not
work.
mr.
joel
levine
that's
right.
my
argument
presupposes--
mr.
joel
levine
--well,
your
honor,
in
a
sense
you
do.
really
the
attempt
to
bifurcate
these
two
issues
is
probably
a
little
unfair
to
this
court.
the
lawyers
in
this
case,
all
of
us
who
are
seated
here
today,
when
we
came
upon
the
scene
of
these
cases...
and
this
is
in
the
record...
it
is
our
contention
that
we
were
faced
with
an
insurmountable
burden
in
attempting
to
build
a
defense
and
defend
our
clients.
now
some
of
the
highlights
of
that
are
contained
in
the
record
of
this
case.
by
way
of
example,
one
of
the
lawyers
in
his
brief
discussed
the
fact
that
there
were
67
inmates
who
could
have
had
some
knowledge
of
the
murder
which
occurred
in
a
certain
unit
at
lompoc.
mr.
joel
levine
if
they
knew
us.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
that
would
have
been
the
case
had
somebody
who
was
associated
with
them
retained
an
attorney
such
as
myself,
and
if
these
defendants,
we
have
to
assume,
had
the
ability
to
pay
for
an
attorney.
but
we
are
dealing
with
defendants
who
are
indigent,
who
did
not
have
the
ability
to
retain
an
attorney
either
at
the
time
of
these
murders
or
20
months
later.
they
all
established
their
indigency
and,
your
honor,
in
the
opinion
by
judge
sneed,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
was
one
of
the
requirements
of
his
rule,
was
that
the
inmate,
in
order
to
be
afforded
the
right
to
counsel
needed
to
establish
indigency.
he
further
needed
to
ask
for
an
attorney.
and
if
he
was
held
outside
the
general
prison
population
for
a
period
in
excess
of
90
days
then
judge
sneed
said,
with
the
majority
of
the
court,
that
he
would
either
have
to
be
released
to
the
population
of
the
prison
or
afforded
an
attorney.
he
gave
the
bureau
of
prisons
a
choice.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
in
the
control
unit--
mr.
joel
levine
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
joel
levine
--i
understand
that.
mr.
joel
levine
i
think
he
has
a
tremendous
advantage
by
going
to
the
general
population.
first
of
all,
let's
say
for
the
sake
of
argument--
mr.
joel
levine
--okay.
in
the
general
prison
population
there
are
perhaps
15
times
as
many
inmates
as
there
are
in
control
unit,
if
we
assume
there
are
15
units
in
the
prison.
in
that
inmate
population
are
going
to
be,
especially
if
he
is
released
within
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
from
the
murder,
are
going
to
be
persons
who
may
know
something
about
the
murder,
who
may
know
something
about
the
witnesses
the
government
is
going
to
call,
and
who
may
also
know
something
about
other
persons
who,
let's
say,
had
a
grudge
against
the
decedent.
now
that's
an
important
point,
the
last
one
i
made,
because
in
each
of
these
two
prosecutions
there
was
an
alternate
theory
of
who
may
have
committed
this
murder,
as
opposed
to
the
defendants
who
were
on
trial.
in
the
gouveia
case--
mr.
joel
levine
--he
has
the
right
to
do
it
and
maybe
the
potential--
mr.
joel
levine
--that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor,
and
unfortunately
in
a
prison
setting
that
occurs
more
often
than
not.
we're
not
here
to
condone
that
kind
of
activity,
but
we're
trying
to
give
a
defendant
who
is
on
trial
for
his
life...
and
these
defendants,
at
least
in
the
gouveia
case,
when
you
talk
about
prejudice--
mr.
joel
levine
--even
if
he
were
in
isolation.
mr.
joel
levine
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
joel
levine
he
would
have
a
right
to
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
joel
levine
i
think
within
certain
limitations,
yes.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
your
honor,
maybe
two
or
three
a
day.
there
are
opportunities
to
make
arrangements
with
prisoners.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
not
the
lawyers,
your
honor.
the
opportunity
exists
and
in
this
particular
case
i
think
there
has
been
a
record
made.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the--
mr.
joel
levine
--if
i
were
an
accused
in
that
position,
i
would
prefer
to
have
a
lawyer.
i...
that's
perhaps
just
one--
mr.
joel
levine
--we
did
it
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
levine
we
did
it
in
this
case
and
it's
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
levine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
levine
no,
this
was
after
indictment.
this
was
after--
mr.
joel
levine
--i
don't
see
why
a
paid
lawyer
would
not
do
it.
mr.
joel
levine
no.
the
lawyers
went
to
the
prison.
mr.
joel
levine
that's
right.
the
lawyers
attempted
to
interview
people
who
knew
something
about
these
murders,
and
they
went
to
lompoc,
and
this
is
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case,
and
they
attempted
to
find
people
who
might
have
known
something
about
the
alternate
theories
of
the
murders
or
who
might
have
known
something
about
the
government's
witnesses.
and
to
a
limited
degree
we
were
able
to
interview
some
people,
but
the
use
of
the
word
20
months
had
expired.
by
that
time
the
potential
witnesses
and
the
use
of
evidence
of
an
alternate
theory
had
evaporated,
and
our
hands
were
if
not
tied
completely
at
least
tied
to
a
very
large
extent
in
attempting
to
build
a
defense
for
these
defendants.
mr.
joel
levine
i--
mr.
joel
levine
--justice
o'connor
in
response
to
your
question,
that
comes
up
in
the
government's
brief
time
and
time
again.
there
is
the
allegation
that
the
gouveia
defendants...
and
i
participated
in
that
trial...
called
14
alibi
witnesses
and
31
witnesses
in
all
to
defend
themselves.
that
issue
came
up
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
ninth
circuit
as
well,
and
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
here,
as
it
was
pointed
out
there,
you
are
dealing
with
14
alibi
witnesses
for
five
different
people
in
a
trial,
and
35
witnesses
or
31
witnesses
for
five
different
people,
and
it's
not
the
quantity
of
witnesses
alone
which
should
determine
whether
a
person
has
had
an
adequate
defense.
it's
the
quality
of
those
witnesses.
for
example,
on
behalf
of
mr.
segura,
who
i
represented
at
the
trial,
i
called
five
people
who
could
be
characterized
as
alibi
witnesses,
and
of
those
five...
and
maybe
this
is
just
a
quantitative
or
qualitative
evaluation
of
my
own...
there
was
really
only
one
who
established
his
alibi
or
who
attempted
to
do
so.
the
other
persons,
their
memories
were
so
dimmed
by
the
passage
of
20
months,
by
that
time
27
months,
that
their
ability
to
relate
facts
to
a
jury
was
severely
limited,
and
we
attempted
in
our
pretrial
motions
to
delineate
other
witnesses
who
might
have
known
where
these
people
were
but
had
either
disappeared
into
the
world
outside
prison
or
who
had
been
transferred
to
other
prisons
and
we
couldn't
locate
because
we
only
knew
them
by
nicknames.
they
were
no
longer
at
lompoc.
it's
those
kinds
of
problems
that
really
make
this
case
a
nightmare
for
a
trial
lawyer.
mr.
joel
levine
appointed
after
indictment,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
levine
not
according
to
judge
sneed's
opinion,
there
would
not.
judge
sneed
gave
them
the
choice.
mr.
joel
levine
that's
correct.
or,
if
they
kept
him
in
isolation
beyond
that
date,
then
he
would
have
a
lawyer.
mr.
joel
levine
the
choice
was
being
given
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
i
guess
what
judge
sneed
was
saying
was
that
if
any
given
prisoner
is
such
as
threat
to
the
security
of
the
prison
that
you
have
to
keep
him
past
90
days,
then
give
him
a
lawyer,
and
if
he
isn't
such
a
threat
and
you're
holding
him
for
trial
past
90
days,
then
let
him
out
into
the
prison
population
where
at
least
he
can
attempt
to
do
something
to
establish
or
build
his
own
defense.
mr.
joel
levine
well,
there
would
have
been
a
risk
with
every
prisoner
being
released.
with
some
of
them
the
risk
would
be
smaller
than
with
others.
i
think
what
judge
sneed
was
doing
was
giving
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
opportunity
to
make
that
evaluation,
which
they...
they're
the
ones
that
should.
justice
marshall
asked...
he
doesn't
like
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
would
be
running
the
prisons.
judge
sneed's
opinion
gives
that
right
to
the
bureau
of
prisons.
they
should
make
the
determination
and
either
choose
point
a
or
point
b,
whichever
one
they
felt
is
better
in
their
own
discretion.
in
closing,
your
honor,
let
me
just
make
this
comment
about
this
entire
case.
when
we
talk
about
the
potential
prejudice
or
prejudice,
as
the
morrison
case
discusses,
when
you
have
six
people
who
are
serving
life
plus
99
years
in
prison,
the
claims
of
prejudice
begin
to
get
your
attention.
and
in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
beginning
to
take
a
rather
inconsistent
position
when
you
hear
them
argue
in
the
case
immediately
preceding
this
that
it
is
the
government's
interest
to
bring
people
to
trial
while
the
evidence
is
new
and
the
memories
of
witnesses
are
clear
and
in
this
particular
case
they
seem
not
to
have
very
much
concern
for
that
position,
and
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
am
through.
mr.
joel
levine
your
honor,
the
way
one
of
these
cases
is
typically
investigated...
and
i
know
in
the
brief
that
i
supplied
the
court
with
i
outlined
a
step-by-step
approach
to
how
they
found
their
evidence
in
this
case,
and
the
dates
upon
which
they
found
it.
and
i
think
it's
a
very,
very
good
illustration
of
how
fast
the
government
really
does
come
up
with
their
evidence
in
one
of
these
cases.
maybe
they
don't
do
it
within
90
days,
maybe
they
don't
do
it
within
45
days,
but
when
they...
when
a
murder
occurs
at
an
institution
such
as
lompoc
what
happens
is
the
fbi
goes
out
and
interviews
perhaps
half,
if
not
more
than
half,
of
the
prison
population.
of
that
number
of
people...
and
this
is
in
the
record,
too,
in
mr.
wilkins'
affidavit,
he
was
the
fbi
agent...
perhaps
98
or
99
percent
of
those
prisoners
are
going
to
tell
the
fbi
i
know
nothing
about
this
case.
and
they
do
that
because
that's
the
credo
within
the
prison.
mr.
joel
levine
absolutely.
there
is
a
one,
two
or
three
percent
part
of
the
prison
population
who
are
always
looking
to
be
informants
or
to
get
a
favor
out
of
the
government
and
maybe,
in
the
government's
view,
to
tell
the
truth
about
what
happened.
those
people
immediately
come
forward,
are
immediately
interviewed.
their
interviews
are
memorialized
in
fbi
documents.
and
those
people
are
taken
away
from
the
general
prison
population
and
placed
into
protective
custody.
from
that
point
on
the
government
puts
together
its
physical
evidence,
however
long
that
takes.
but
they
have
their
case
on
ice.
they
have
the
defendants
on
ice
in
isolation,
and
the
defendants
cannot
do
what
the
government
is
doing.
i
was
in
court
when
judge
gray
dismissed
the
mills
case
the
first
time,
and
those
were
his
comments
in
dismissing
that
indictment.
his
attitude
was
well,
the
government
can
develop
its
case
right
away,
and
then
keep
the
defendants
on
hold
indefinitely
while
they
have
no
opportunity
to
build
a
defense
for
themselves.
and
here
we're
dealing
with
a
murder
prosecution.
and
there's
no
statute
of
limitations.
so
if
there
is
no
right
to
counsel,
when
does
it
end?
it
could
go
on
forever.
in
this
case,
it
went
on
20
months
and
we
claim
the
prejudice
was
pervasive.
