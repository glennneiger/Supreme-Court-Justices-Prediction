mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
really
at
complete
odds
with
opposing
counsel
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning
point
of
it.
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
law
was
clearly
established
when
gregory
scherer
was
fired,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
some
opportunity,
some
right
to
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
he
was
terminated
from
public
employment.
the
district
court
judge
found
that
he
did
not
have
that
right
to
some
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
district
court
found
that
scherer's
right
to
due
process
was
clearly
established
and
that
it
had
been
violated
by
his
termination
without
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
was
that
scherer
did
have
a
conflict
with
the
people
in
his
troop.
his
supervisor
recommended
a
three-day
suspension
on
october
12,
1977.
twelve
days
later
colonel
beach
fired
him
without
an
opportunity
for
scherer
to
be
heard
by
colonel
beach
in
any
fashion...
in
terms
of
a
written
letter,
in
terms
of
an
opportunity
to
appear.
and
from
fuentes
v.
shevin,
and
perry
v.
sindermann,
and
roth
v.
board
of
regents,
and
arnett
v.
kennedy,
the
law
was
clearly
established
that
there
should
be
some
opportunity
to
be
heard
before
the
disciplinarian
takes
the
disciplinary
act.
and
the
disciplinarian
in
this
case
was
colonel
beach.
and
the
law
that
clearly
established
it
beyond
peradventure
was
thurston
v.
dekle,
a
1976
fifth
circuit
case.
when
mr.
franks
was
discussing
the
law,
i
think
he
misspoke,
and
he
called
weisbrod
v.
donigan
thurston
v.
dekle.
thurston
v.
dekle
is
the
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
said
the
accommodation
that
must
be
struck
must
include
some
minimal
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
the
determiner
of
the
ultimate
sanction
before
the
sanction
is
imposed,
and
then,
of
course,
there
would
be
a
post-termination
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
o'connor,
first,
the
statutory
question
here,
whether
the
statutes
are
constitutional
or
not,
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
i've
conceded
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
declaring
unconstitutional
the
civil
service
statute.
what
we're
focusing
on
here
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court
was
right
or
wrong
in
its
initial
determination
that
scherer
was
entitled
to
some
opportunity
to
be
heard--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--under
the
federal
constitution,
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
absolutely
not,
justice
white.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case
at
all.
the
question,
the
threshold
question
is
was
the
constitutional
right
clearly
established,
and
was
scherer
deprived
of
that
right.
if
he
was,
there
is
no
need
to
reach
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
or
anything
else
in
this
case.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
given
this
court's
opinions
and
given
thurston
v.
dekle,
the
district
court's
initial
ruling,
which
was
that
the
law
was
clearly
established,
was
right.
then
the
district
court
retreated
in
light
of
weisbrod
v.
donigan.
and
weisbrod
v.
donigan
is
a
page
and
a
half
decision
that
never
even
makes
a
mention
of
all
of
the
due
process
cases.
and
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
weisbrod
v.
donigan
is
that
it
is
an
anomaly.
it
certainly
was
no
basis
for
the
district
court
to
have
retreated
from
its
initial
conclusion.
and
oddly,
if
one
follows
through
on
thurston
v.
dekle,
and
the
district
court
did...
there's
a
case
called
glenn
v.
neuman
at
614
f.
second,
a
fifth
circuit
case
in
1980,
which
says
very
clearly
that
thurston
v.
dekle
sets
forth
the
due
process
law
in
this
circuit,
which
is
some
chance
to
be
heard
before
you're
fired.
and
scherer--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it...
when
weisbrod
came
out,
five
days
later
the
district
court
then
amended
its
original
judgment
and
said
well,
weisbrod
says
that
the
law
wasn't
clearly
established,
although
weisbrod
really
says
very
little,
if
anything,
about
that,
and
weisbrod
does
not
pay
any
attention
to
what
all
the
due
process
development
had
been.
i...
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
district
court
when
weisbrod
came
out
felt
obliged
to
follow
the
last
word,
even
though
the
last
word
was
not
consistent
with--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--that's
right.
his
original
reason,
that
he
was
right
in
his
original
decision,
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
retreat.
and
all...
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
law
that
he
based
his
original
decision
on,
i
think
that
that
law
amply
supports
his...
his
judgment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
oh,
yes,
i
can
reach
that,
too,
and
defend
that
also.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
to
that
if
he
was
right
in
his
initial
opinion.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
at
all,
but
i'd
like
to--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
the
alternative
ground,
of
course,
is
the
ground...
if
the
law
is
clearly
established,
then
harlow
presents
no
issue
at
all
in
the
case.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
that
is
not
so.
justice
white,
what
he
said
was
was
that
the
constitutional...
i'm
looking
at
page
71
and
71a
of
the
joint...
of
the
appendix
in
the
jurisdictional
statement...
he
said
that
scherer's
due
process
rights
were
violated,
and
the
department's
own
orders
were
violated.
and
so
the
district
court
judge
found
that
they
should
be
bound,
meaning
the
defendants,
by
their
department's
own
orders
and
held
accountable
for
not
affording
plaintiff
due
process.
what
happened
here
was
this:
the
district
court,
once
it
decided
it
had--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--70a
and
71a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix.
that's
a
district
order,
the
second,
the
amended
district
court
judgment.
they
should
be
bound
by
their
department's
own
orders
and
held
accountable
for
not
affording
plaintiff
due
process.
this
is
what
occurred.
when
weisbrod
v.
donigan
led
the
district
court
to
think
he
had
to
retreat
from
his
original
decision,
he
then
still
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
but
not
clearly
established
constitutional
law,
because
weisbrod
had
taken
him
off
that
point.
and
so
then
he
had
to
make
a
decision
about
damages.
the
damage
decision
in
this
case
was
not
based
on
a
violation
of
the
state
regulation.
it
was
based
upon
a
violation
of
constitutional
law
and
a
parallel
regulation
of
the
state
which
was
also
violated,
and
putting
the
two
together,
the
judge
felt
that
there
was
no
impediment
to
awarding
damages
in
the
case.
and
harlow
is
now
raised
because
the
government
says
that
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
holds
that
you
can
only
award
damages
if
you're
dealing
with
a
violation
of
clearly
established
constitutional
law.
of
course,
our
initial
point
is
that
yes,
there
was
a
clearly
established--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--the
combination
of
general
order
43
and
the
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that's
right.
after
weisbrod
v.
donigan.
he--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
due
process
was
violated.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
if
that
were
the
only
basis
for
awarding
damages,
the
violation
of
state
law,
that...
that
would
be
a
different
case
from
this
one.
but
when
you
look
at
70
and
71a,
he
melds
them
both
together.
the
difficulty
is
harlow
talks
about
clearly
established
constitutional
rights
being
violated.
there's
no
dispute
between
the
government
and
us
that
if
that
is
so,
then
scherer
is
entitled
to
damages.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
which
per
curiam
affirmed
the
decision
below.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i...
the
alternative
ground,
which
is
clear
from
this
record
and
easily--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--that
the
case...
the
case
has
had
a
long
history
already,
and
since
the
law
was
so
clearly
established,
it
seems
to
us
there
is
no
problem
in
this
court
taking
the
original
judgment
that
the
district
court
found
and
saying
he
was
right
in
that
original
judgment,
and
that
supports
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
harlow
problem
that's
raised
by
the
other
side
is
they
neglect
at
all
to
make
the
distinction
between
discretionary
and
nondiscretionary
duties.
even
if...
even
if
harlow
is
implicated
in
this
case,
this
case
doesn't
run
afoul
of
harlow.
harlow
says
that
when
a
public
official
is
performing
a
discretionary
duty,
then
if
he
or
she
violates
clearly
established
law,
then
they're
liable
in
damages.
this...
in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
a
nondiscretionary,
mandatory
duty.
colonel
beach
had
a
mandatory
duty
to
give
scherer,
under
the
state
regulation,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard;
and
he
didn't
do
that
under
the
state
regulation.
so
we're
dealing
here
with
a
nondiscretionary
duty,
and
once
the
concern
about
discretionary/nondiscretionary
functions
is
removed
from
the
case,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
or
not
the
official
was
acting
in
good
faith
and
whether
or
not
damages
can
be
awarded
on
a
summary
judgment
basis.
the
court
had
two
concerns
in
harlow.
once
is
if
a
defendant...
if
a
public
official
has
to
choose
between
a
and
b,
the
public
official
should
not
worry
about
the
potential
of
a
damage
action
being
filed.
the
clearly
established
constitutional
right
principle
would
mean
that
in
choosing
between
a
and
b,
if
he
violated
that
clearly
established
principle,
there
would
be
damages.
but
if
it
weren't
clearly
established,
then
he
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
the
choice.
when
you're
dealing
with
a
nondiscretionary
duty
as
in
this
situation,
then
we
come
to
whether
or
not
the
official's
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable.
and
objective
reasonableness...
and
this
is
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case...
it
measured
objective
reasonableness
by
a
violation
of
a
state
regulation--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
certainly
did
in
its
language.
it
speaks
very
clearly
and
distinctly
about--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--when...
yes.
and
i've
set
it
out
in
the
brief.
when
an
official
is
performing
a
discretionary
function,
then
generally
he
or
she
should
not
be
held
liable
in
damages.
and...
and
what
we've
got
in
this
situation
is
a
nondiscretionary
function.
and
one
of
the
other
concerns
about
harlow
was
summary
judgment.
can
you
decide
a
case
on
summary
judgment,
or
will
you
get
tied
up
in
trying
these
cases
on
good
faith/bad
faith?
if
one
looks
at
this
situation,
beach's
violation
of
the
regulation
is
clear.
it's
an
objective
criteria.
so
the
violation
of
the
regulation
and
the
due
process
violation,
albeit
it
not
clearly
established
the
way
the
district
judge
came
to
his
second
conclusion,
allows
there
to
be
a
decision
on
immunity
without
having
to
have
a
full
trial.
so
we
have
a
violation
of
an
established
constitutional
principle
and
a
violation
of
a
regulation
which
parallels
that
principle.
and
that
then
allows
a
district
court
to
award
damages
without
the
need
for
a
trial
on
whether
or
not
the
official
was
acting
in
good
faith
or
bad
faith.
and
that's
why
harlow
is
really
no
problem.
and,
justice
white,
i
can
defend
this
case
on
the
harlow
grounds.
the
solicitor
general
nor
the
state
have
made
the
distinction
between
discretionary/nondiscretionary
duties.
they
lump
them
all
together.
that's
not
what
harlow
talks
about.
and
in
terms
of
the
focus
being
on
objective
criteria,
the
violation
of
the
regulation
here,
along
with
the
violation
of
the
constitution,
meets
the
objective
criteria...
objective
criteria
test
and
does
not
require
the
case
to
be
tried.
it
can
be
determined
on
summary
judgment
in--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--because
defendant
beach
under
the
regulation
had
to,
once
informed
of
a
violation
of...
of
a
departmental
order,
had
to
order
a
complete
investigation
which
will
include
a
statement
from
the
defendant.
that's
general
order
43.
it's
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
at
page
69a.
and
it
was
mandatory.
he
shall,
colonel
beach,
upon
receiving
a
report
of
a
violation,
order
a
complete
investigation.
he
did
not
do
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
yes.
and
in
a
situation
like--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--harlow
focused
on
discretionary/nondiscretionary,
which
must
have
some
content,
and
here
we're
dealing
with
mandatory
language.
this
could
have
been
the
basis
of
a
mandamus
action.
he
shall
do
something.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i...
we're
dealing
here
with...
with
one
step...
i
like
to
take
them
one
step
at
a
time...
and
i
think
that
when
you're
dealing
with
a
regulation
that
parallels
the
constitutional
right...
and
that's
exactly
what
this
regulation
does;
in
fact,
it
looks
like
it
was
passed
to
enact
really
the
meaning
of
thurston
v.
dekle.
i
think
in
that
situation
there
is
no
need
for
a
district
court
to
make
further
inquiry.
whether
or
not
in
some
subsequent
case
that
might
be,
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
suggests
in
this
parade
of
horribles
about
what
may
happen
in
the
future;
but
my
concern
is
this
case
and
the
constitutional
due
process
right.
and
harlow
certainly
did
not
preclude
the
use
of
a
regulation
or
statutory
violation
when
it's
clear
and
mandatory
as
being
a
portion
of
the
basis
for
making
the
decision.
the
essential
basis,
of
course,
is
the
violation
of
the
constitution
which
existed
in
this
case.
there
is
another
problem
in
this
case,
and
that's
a
jurisdictional
one.
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1254(2),
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
a
case
on
appeal
is
limited
to
those
federal
questions
presented
in
the
declaring
unconstitutional
of
the
state
statute
by
the
federal
court.
this
harlow
federal
question
presented
is...
is
clearly
not...
is
clearly
not
one
that
arises
through
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
state
statute
was
unconstitutional.
once
i've
conceded
that
portion
of
the
case,
that
the
court
should
not
have
reached
that,
what
is
left?
only
possibly
an
issue
that
should
be
decided
on
certiorari.
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari
sought
in
this
case.
1254(2)
limits
the
federal
questions
presented
not
to
the
question
that's
been
presented,
a
subsidiary
question
presented
in
this
case.
and
so
our
position
is
is
that
the
court
should
not
exercise
its
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
harlow
problem
in
the
case.
i
call
it
a
problem
only
because
the
other
side
has
called
it
a
problem.
but
on
those
three
grounds,
then,
we
think
that
the
decision
below
regarding
to
damages
should
be
affirmed:
a)
that
the
law
was
clearly
established
and
therefore
there's
no
need
to
get
into
any
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
an
immunity
problem
in
the
case;
b)
if
the
law
was
not
clearly
established,
harlow
is
no
problem
because
harlow
focuses
on
a
discretionary
duty,
not
a
nondiscretionary
duty,
and
harlow
focuses
on
deciding
these
cases
on
summary
judgment,
and
this
could
have
been
decided
on
summary
judgment
because
colonel
beach
violated
a
nondiscretionary
duty,
and
he
also
violated
the
constitution;
and
finally,
that
there's
no
need
to
exercise
the
court's
jurisdiction
since
under
1254(2)
it's
limited,
and
we've
conceded
the
point
dealing
with
the
declaring
unconstitutional
of
the
state
