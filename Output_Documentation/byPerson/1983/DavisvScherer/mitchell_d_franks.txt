mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
1983
due
process
case
arose
out
of
the
firing
of
an
employee
of
the
florida
highway
patrol
in
1977.
although
the
district
court
ultimately
held
that
the
law
regarding
pre-termination
due
process
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
firing,
it
nevertheless
continued
on
and
ruled
that
the
florida
statute,
chapter
110,
was
unconstitutional
in
that
it
violated
post-termination
due
process.
it
also
continued
on
and
found
that
the
employee
was
entitled
to
damages
under
1983
not
for
any
violation
of
clearly
established
constitutional
law,
but
because
the
defendants
did
not
follow
a
departmental
regulation
recently
enacted
in
terminating
this
employee.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
there
are--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
no,
justice
o'connor.
the
older
statute
was
enacted
previously,
was
in
1977,
general
law,
and
by
the
amendment
in
1981
that
statute
was
vitiated
and
is
no
longer
part
of
this
case.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that
is--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i...
i
don't
know
that
i
would
call
it
a
speedy
investigation.
i
believe
the
word
is
thorough
investigation.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
on
complete
investigation.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
in
fact,
yes,
that's
correct.
there...
there
is
nothing
left
of
the...
of
the
original
july
15,
1981
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes,
sir.
they
have
conceded
that.
and--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--well,
the...
the
concession
by
the
appellee
was
not
made,
justice
rehnquist,
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
was
filed.
they
defended
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
their
jurisdictional...
in
their
jurisdictional
brief
or
in
their
motion
to
oppose
or
dismiss.
and
it
wasn't
until
we
got
to
the
brief
on
the
merits
that
the
appellee
conceded
that
the
district
court
erred
in
finding
the
1981
statute
unconstitutional.
however,
the
appeal
was
brought
here
properly
under
1254(2),
28
u.s.
code
1252;
and
it
carries
with
it
the
federal
questions
that
are
attendant
to
that
appeal.
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
that
issue
and
its
attendant
federal
question
issues,
and
that
federal
question
issue
that's
remaining
is
the
qualified
good
faith
immunity
of
the
governmental
employees.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
with
respect
to
a
judgment
for
damages.
here--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--which
is
still
outstanding,
yes,
sir.
so
we
feel
that
the
court
has
the
jurisdiction
and
can
proceed
on
to
address
the
issue
that
is
remaining,
and
as
we
see
it
is
the
good
faith
immunity
of
the
governmental
officials
and
their
action
in
terminating
this
insubordinate
personnel.
the
facts
are
somewhat
convoluted,
but
essentially
the
employee
scherer
requested
permission
to
work
a
second
job
with
the
escambia
county
sheriff's
department
in
florida.
that
permission
was
erroneously
granted
when
a
letter
that
the
captain
had
instructed
his
secretary
not
to
mail
was
mailed.
the
employee
immediately
went
out
and
bought
a
handgun
and
a
uniform
and
proceeded
work.
a
couple
of
weeks
later
the
captain
found
that
the
employee
was
working,
went
back,
found
out
that
the
letter
had
been
inadvertently
mailed;
and
he
was
instructed,
both
orally
and
in
writing,
to
cease
his
second
job
because
there
was
a
potential
for
a
conflict.
he
was
a
radio
teletype
operator,
not
a
trooper.
there
were
only
six
radio
teletype
operators
in
that
particular
troop
in
pensacola,
and
they
worked
around
the
clock.
the
troopers
in
that
particular...
in
the
highway
patrol
were
the
beneficiaries
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
police
benevolent
association
by
which
troopers
could
work
second
jobs,
and
their
employers,
the
highway
patrol,
were
required
to
allow
them
to
work.
no
such
benefit
was
accorded
to
the
radio
teletype
operators
or
to
other
administrative
support
personnel.
but
in
any
event,
he
continued
his
second
job,
the
sergeant
found
out
about
it
and
advised
him
that
he
was
in
violation
of
the
captain's
orders
to
cease
his
second
job.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
there
were
numerous
conferences
on
this
point
and
that
he
refused
to
terminate
his
second
job.
he
was
stating
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
a
conflict,
not
that
one
did
or
did
not
exist...
that's
not
the
point...
but
whether
he
didn't
see
one.
and
as
a
result
of
his
not
seeing
it,
although
he
had
been
told
to
cease
his
job,
refused
to
do
so.
this
was
reported
up
through
channels.
the
sergeant
recommended
termination.
his
lieutenant--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes,
sir,
that's
right.
we
are
taking
that
position.
the
court--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--well,
we...
we
submit
that,
your
honor,
that
it
comes
part
and
parcel
with
the
good
faith...
qualified
good
faith
immunity
that
is
addressed
in
our
jurisdictional
brief;
that
the
court
found
that
the
law
regarding
the
pre-termination
of
due
process
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
i
would
say
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that's
correct.
and
even
going
back
to
1977
and
looking
at
it
at
that
point,
he
was
advised
of
why
he
was
in
violation
of
the
order;
he
was
advised,
both
orally
and
in
writing,
as
to
why...
what
could
happen
to
him.
and
his
response
was
fire
me,
or
i
have
been
advised...
and
he
put
this
in
writing
on
the
18th
of
october,
just
shortly
before
the
termination
letter
came
down...
that
he
was
aware
that
he
could
be
terminated,
but
he
didn't
see...
he
didn't
see
a
conflict.
the
appellee
here
is
not
arguing,
the
employee
is
not
arguing
that
your
facts
are
wrong,
and
here
are
the
reasons
why
your
facts
are
wrong,
and
this
is
why
i
should
have
a
hearing.
he
concedes
that.
he
says
i
don't
agree
with
your
policy.
he
is
not
arguing
that
the
facts
aren't
true,
that
he
is
in
violation
of
the
dual
employment
status,
but
rather
that
the
operational
policy
is
not
wild...
is
not
wise.
now,
he's
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
wisdom
of
the
policy.
he's
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
the
legality
of--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
would
say
that
the--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--the
fifth
circuit's
adoption
of
the...
of
the
standard
in
weisbrod
where
they
held
that
the
individual
is
entitled
to
notice
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
respond
to
the
notice
of...
of
disciplinary
action
has
been
clearly
established
since
the
facts,
the
operative
facts
were
developed
in
this
case.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
oh,
no.
the
weisbrod
decision
came
out
considerably
after--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--well,
i'd
say
that
the...
there
was
no
violation
of...
of
his
constitutional
rights
at
any
time
as
it
regards
his
notice
that
he
could
be
terminated
for
his
failure
to
terminate
his
second
job,
whether
he
challenges
the
wisdom--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
well,
we
believe
that
the...
it
adopts
or
looks
to
arnett
v.
johnson
as...
as
the
guidance
for
the
type
of
hearing.
some
sort
of
hearing
must
be
required.
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
have
a
full-blown
evidentiary
pre-termination
hearing,
but
rather
that
the
individual
be
notified,
be
put
on
notice.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes,
sir.
we
lived
with
that,
and
we
think
that's
the...
the
correct
statement.
but
those
aren't
the
facts
that
were...
that
are
attendant
here.
the
court
went
on,
as
i
indicated,
and
they
found
that
the
state
had
adopted
a
general
regulation
which
stated
that
there
must
be
a
thorough
investigation.
this
is
a...
the
florida
highway
patrol
is
a
paramilitary
organization,
and
the
facts
reflect
that
there
was
a
thorough
investigation
made
of
this
incident,
and
that
it
was
reported
up
through
the
channels.
it
went
from
pensacola
to
panama
city
where
his
captain
was
to
tallahassee
where
the
appellants,
colonel
beach
and
mr.
davis,
referred
the
matter
to
the
legal
office
and
the
personnel
office
and
were
advised
that
the
matter
was...
was
proper
and
proceeded
to
terminate
this
insubordinate
personnel.
and
the
court
found
in
analyzing
1983
that
because
the
state,
or
in
this
case
an
agency
of
the
state,
had
promulgated
a
regulation,
that
that
was
a
sufficient
basis
under
1983
to
award
damages
for
a
violation
which...
of...
of
state
law
and
state
regulation
and
not
of
any
clearly
established
constitutional
right.
now,
the
court
originally
found
that
there
was
a
right
that
was
there,
but
they
retreated
from
that
in
a
subsequent
opinion
in
june
of
1982
which
was
announced
a
couple
of
weeks
before
the
harlow.
so
admittedly,
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
wisdom
of
this
court
in
the
harlow
decision,
but...
and
harlow
did
away
with
the
subjective
prong
and
looked
to
was
the
violation
of
the
law
clearly
established,
and
was
it
clearly
established
constitutional
law,
not
state
law.
because
you
looked
to
the
decision
of
procunier
v.
navarette,
and
there
was
an
allegation
in
that
case
that
prison
officials
had
violated
clearly
established
state
law
and
regulations
regarding
the
prison
mailing
regulations.
and
the
court
specifically
rejected
that
as
a
finding
and
found
that
the
law
had
to
be
one
that
was
clearly
established
and
was
under
the
constitution.
now,
to
look
at
the
law
and
in
preparing
for
this
case
i
came
across
an
admonition
of
former
solicitor
general
and
dean
irwin
griswold,
and
his
statement
to
his
students
was
look
to
the
law;
and
when
we
look
to
the
law,
we
find
1983,
and
it
says
that...
that
the
individuals
will
be
subject
to
the...
within
the
jurisdiction
thereof
the
deprivation
of
any
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
secured
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws.
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
laws
therein
do
not
address
state
laws
but
rather
federal
laws,
because
this
act,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871,
was
designed
and
directed
toward
the
abrogation
of
state...
by
states
of
the
rights
secured
by
the
constitution,
particularly
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
if
a
state
adopted
rules
and
regulations
that
go
beyond
those
required
to
be
clearly...
as
required
by
clearly
established
constitutional
law?
for
example,
if
there
is
a
jail
inspection
statute
and
there
is
no
requirement
that
individuals
go
out
and
inspect
jails
except
by
the
state
law.
if
state
a
promulgates
such
a
regulation
and
they
go
out
and
they
violate
it,
then
under
the
holding
in
this
case
and
in
the
position
urged
by
the
appellee,
those
state
officials
would
be
subject
to
a
constitutional
suit
for
damages,
whereas--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--i
think
that
he
looked
at
it
purely
as
a
denial
of
good
faith
immunity.
he
found
specifically,
one,
that
the
law
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time;
and,
two,
he
found
that
there
was
no
malice
involved.
so
he
then
looked
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
conduct
of
the
officials
and
stated
that
because
there
was
a
clearly
established
state
regulation
or
departmental
regulation
that
their...
this
abrogated
their
shield
of
good
faith
immunity,
and
for
that
reason
he
would
be
subject
to
damages,
not
for
the
violation--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--we
would
argue...
urge
that
there
is
nothing
to
base
the
damage
on
under
the
law
that
was
announced
in
harlow,
and
i
see
no
need
to
retreat
from--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--the
settlement
agreement
was
reached
in
his
state
career
service
proceeding
whereby
he
was
challenging
the
termination,
and
he
was
ordered
reinstated
with
partial
back
pay.
and
the
difference
between
full
back
pay
and
partial
back
pay
was
the
difference
between--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--no.
it
was
purely
addressed
under
state
career
service
regulations.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
and
turn
over
to
the
united
states
the
argument
that
we
consider
today.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
thank
you,
sir.
addressing
the
last
point
first,
even
assuming...
and
we're
not
conceding
that
it's
correct...
that
this
case
was
prominently
brought
here
under
1254(2),
this
court
has
the
authority
to
consider
the
other
questions
that
came
along
with
the
1254
as
a
request
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
under
2103,
28
u.s.
code
2103,
and
may
consider
that
point
on
a
writ
of
certiorari.
we
would
urge
the
court
that
if
they
do
so
to
consider
addressing
the...
the
writ
on
the
basis
of
the
conflict
between
the
various
circuits
on
the
point
of
whether
or
not
a
violation
of
state
or
regulatory
law--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
that's
our
first
argument,
and
everything
that
came
with
it
is
likewise
here
on
appeal
and
can
be
considered.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
we
would
argue
that
the
dismissal
or
termination
of
an
employee
is
the
ultimate
in
a...
the
exercise
of
discretionary
function.
what
he's
saying
is
that
this
matter
which
had
been
completely
investigated
and
had
been
forwarded
up
through
the
chain
of
command
and
which
had
been
looked
at
by
the
personnel
office
and
by
the
legal
office,
that
those
officials
had
no
discretion
but
to
order
a
second
or
an
additional
complete
investigation
when
the
facts
were...
were
clear.
in
the
letter
that
was
sent
forward,
the
employee
scherer
stated,
"this
writer
had
talked
with
w.a.
clark
on
two
different
occasions
in
the
past
three
weeks
with
reference
to
my
outside
employment
as
a
deputy
sheriff
of
the
escambia
county
sheriff's
department.
"
"i
have
advised
sergeant
clark
that
i
feel
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
resign
my
position
with
him.
"
"i
feel
it
in
no
way
interferes
with
my
job
as
a
radio
teletype
operator
with
the
florida
highway
patrol.
"
on
cross
examination
scherer
was
asked,
"now,
isn't
it
true
that
on
october
the
3rd
sergeant
clark
informed
you
that
you
were
working
with
the
auxiliary
as
an
auxiliary
sheriff;
that
was
contrary
to
the
captain's
instructions?
"
"they
told
me"...
answer:
"they
told
me
i
would
have
to
quit
or
they
would
fire
me.
"
"on
october
the
3rd
is
that
what
he
told
you?
"
"yes".
"what
was
your
response"?
"i
told
him
to
fire
me.
"
that's
in
the
record.
clearly,
these
officials
were
exercising
their
discretionary
function.
this
insubordinate
employee
who
didn't
like
the
answer
he
got,
but
nevertheless
had
notice
of
possible
termination,
and
was
afforded
the
opportunity
and
availed
himself
of
that
opportunity
to
state
his
side
of
the
case.
he
didn't
agree
with
the
policy
and
not
the
facts
regarding--
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
--the
fifth
circuit,
justice
marshall,
has
held
that
that
is
a
form
of
hearing
which
meets
the
due
process.
mr.
mitchell
d.
franks
yes,
sir,
i
do.
he
was
advised
of
the...
of
the
potential
of
what
could
happen
to
him
if
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
quit
his
second
job,
and
he
nevertheless
persisted.
he
was
given
an
