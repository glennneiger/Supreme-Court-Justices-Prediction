mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
defining
the
contours
of
the
concept
of
qualified
official
immunity,
this
court
has
attempted
to
balance
two
important
but
competing
interests:
the
right
of
the
individual
to
a
remedy
for
a
constitutional
wrong
against
the
necessity
of
protecting
public
officials
from
the
hazards
of
litigation
so
as
to
prevent
undue
disruption
in
the
conduct
of
public
affairs.
beginning
with
the
court's
first
case
in
this
area,
in
pierson
v.
ray,
and
continuing
through
its
decision
in
butz
v.
ecnomou,
it
accommodated
these
interests
by
casting
the
qualified
immunity
defense
as
a
wide-ranging
inquiry
into
the
subjective
and
objective
good
faith
of
the
defendant
public
official.
in
harlow,
however,
relying
on
the
past
experience
of
the
federal
courts...
that
is,
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald...
the
court
recast
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine
as
a
single,
strictly
legal
inquiry
that
turned
on
one
factor;
that
is,
the
court
extended
immunity
to
public
officials
unless
they
violated
clearly
established
rights
of
which
a
reasonable
person
would
have
known.
the
court
left
little
doubt
why
it
was
so
dramatically
restructuring
the
doctrine.
it
did
so
because
the
prior
test
had
rarely
resulted
in
the
dismissal
of
claims
prior
to
actual
litigation
because
it
turned
on
so
many
evidentiary
variables.
the
new
test
was
specifically
designed
to
permit
the
disposition
of
immunity
claims
without
the
necessity
of
subjecting
all
public
officials
to
discovery
and
trial
on
that
issue.
the
question...
the
important
question
presented
here
that's
left
in
this
case
at
this
point
is
whether
or
not
the
court
will
remain
with
the
position
so
recently
taken
in
harlow,
or
whether
the
qualified
immunity
test
will
once
more
evolve
into
a
consideration
of
multiple
factors,
thereby
robbing
the
test
of
the
ability
to
settle
litigation
prior
to
actual
discovery
or
trial.
in
this
case,
the
appellee
entered
federal
district
court
with
a
claim
that
he'd
been
denied
due
process.
although
the
district
court
ultimately
concluded
that
he
was
denied
no
clearly
established
due
process
right...
although
i
would
reply
to
one
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
decision
that
he
found
that
under
current
law
the
statute
would
be...
would
be
violated
now,
or
the
constitution
had
been
violated
in
the
current
provisions,
although
in
1977
when
he'd
been
dismissed
it
wasn't
clearly
established
at
that
point.
he
nevertheless
or
the
court
nevertheless
denied
the
appellants
qualified
immunity,
and
it
did
so
by
citing
what
it
called
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
it
said
looking
at
all
the
facts
in
the
record,
i
see
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
regulatory
provision
here
that
renders
their
conduct
unreasonable.
unreasonable
conduct
is
not
eligible
for
qualified
immunity.
that
sort
of
analysis,
of
course,
has
some
force.
indeed,
it
was
the
analysis
that
prevailed
prior
to
harlow.
but
it
was
specifically
rejected
by
this
court
in
harlow,
and
the
court
made
clear
in
that
case
that
immunity
would
no
longer
depend
upon
an
analysis
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
but
rather
whether
or
not
there
was
allegation
of
clearly
established
rights.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
we
would,
justice
stevens,
for
one
important
question...
for
one
important
reason.
it
becomes
extremely
difficult,
even
when
you
say
the
regulation
is
very
clear,
to
keep
the
analysis
from
going
beyond
the
narrow
bounds
set
in
harlow.
and
let
me
try
and
explain
why.
it
is
a
little
difficult.
what...
what
the
court
did
in
harlow
was
not
say
that
good
faith
is
irrelevant
to
qualified
immunity.
the
court
simply
concluded
that
the
benefits
of
making
qualified
immunity
depend
upon
proof
of
absolute
good
faith,
were
simply
not
worth
the
cost
of
subjecting
all
public
officials
to
discovery
and
trial
on
that
issue.
now,
the
appellee's
argument
here,
and
the
only
argument
that
really
can
be
made
in
support
of
the
approach
below,
is
that
a
violation
of
a
regulatory
or
statutory
provision
demonstrates
the
absence
of
good
faith
but
does
so
in
a
way
that
doesn't
incur
the
kinds
of
costs
associated
with
the
approach
prior
to
harlow.
and
so
taking
from
your
question,
the
argument
would
be
well,
when
they're
clear,
isn't
that
really
a
cost-free
means
of
determining
the
absence
of
good
faith?
we
don't
think
that's
so
at
all
for
this
reason:
when...
when
a
public
official
violates
a
clearly
established
constitutional
right,
we
think
that
it
can
be
fairly
assumed
or
it
can
be
fairly...
that
conduct
can
be
fairly
described
as
lacking
in
good
faith.
after
all,
if
it's
a
clearly
described
constitutional
rule,
the
public
official
should
be
aware
and
should
not
transgress
it.
however,
the
same
thing
cannot
be
said
with
regarding
to
the
vast
majority
of
regulatory
or
statutory
provisions.
they're
rarely
as
clearly
established
as
constitutional
provisions
once
they're
announced
by
this
court.
indeed,
in
this
case
the
appellants
had
the
advice
of
counsel
before
they
dismissed
the
appellee.
the
district
court
looking
even
at
all
the
conduct
in
this
case
said
that
they
acted
in
ultimate...
in...
in
good
faith.
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
even
with
clearly
established
sorts
of
provisions,
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
a
public
official
might
or
might
not
comply
with
the
provision
in
a
given
circumstance.
also,
it's
very
difficult
for
a
court
to
determine
after
the
fact
whether
or
not
something
really
was
clearly
established
in
the
heat
of
battle.
it's
easy
for
a
judge
or
easier
perhaps
for
a
judge
sitting
back
looking
at
a
developed
trial
record
to
say
well,
from
the
words
of
this
regulation
you
should
have
done
a.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
but
the
court
has
not
imposed
liability.
until
we've
determined
that
it's
clearly
established,
we
don't
impose
liability
on
those
public
officials.
another
great
danger
in
this
area
is
that
if
we
accept
the
argument
that
regulatory
or
statutory
violations
are
relevant
to
the
general
good
faith
of
public
officials
and
hence
to
their
qualified
immunity,
there's
no
reason
not
to
expand
the
analysis
beyond
at
that
point
at
the
behest
of
other
plaintiffs.
in
other
cases
there
might
be
commissions
of
common
law
torts
or
violation
of
professional
codes
of
ethics.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be
appropriate.
we
think--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--we
don't
think
that
would
be
appropriate
ever.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
we
don't,
but
we're
making
the
argument
because
when
it
comes
up
in
the
federal
context,
of
course
we're
not
going
to
be
talking
about
state
law.
in
short,
it
is
our
position
that
to
adopt
the
position
of
the
court
below
will
rapidly
and
quickly
recreate
all
of
the
difficulties
that
this
court
sought
to
avoid
in
harlow.
a
court
faced
with
an
immunity
claim
will
once
more
have
to
look
at
that
particular
violation
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case
that
violation
demonstrates
a
lack
of
good
faith.
it
will
not
be
a
simple,
objective
test.
it
will
turn
the
clock
back
past
harlow
to
the
rule
that
prevailed
under
wood
v.
strickland
and
imbler
v.
pachtman,
whereas
this
court
said
the
fate
of
a
public
official
with
qualified
immunity
depends
upon
the
circumstances
and
motivations
of
his
conduct
as
established
by
the
evidence
at
trial.
that
is
precisely
the
result
that
harlow
was
designed
to
avoid.
thank
you.
