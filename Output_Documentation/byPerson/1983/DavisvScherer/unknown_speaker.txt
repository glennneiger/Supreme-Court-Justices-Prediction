unknown
speaker
mr.
franks,
would
you
help
us
interpret
what
the
holding
of
the
district
court
is
now?
unknown
speaker
it...
it
seems
to
have
held...
the
second
district
court
opinion
seemed
to
hold
a
new
statute
unconstitutional;
and
you
agree
that
that
much
of
the
holding
is
in
error,
and
i
guess
the
other
side
does,
too.
unknown
speaker
was
anything
left
of
its
original
finding
that
the
older
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
of
the
failure
to
provide
a
prompt
post-termination
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
you
think
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
original
district
court
holding
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
and
so
all
we
have
is
the
holding
on
the
new
statute--
unknown
speaker
--and...
and
a
finding
that
the
employers
failed
to
follow
their
own
regulation
requiring
a
speedy
investigation,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
your...
your...
your
opponent
agrees,
does
he
not--
unknown
speaker
--that
that
part
of
the
judgment
which
declared
the
1981
statute
unconstitutional
should
be
vacated.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
there
left
for
us?
is
it
this
issue
of
whether
failure
to
follow
regulations
by
a
state
official
amounts
to
some
sort
of
due
process
violation?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
a
judgment
for
damages.
unknown
speaker
which
is
outstanding.
unknown
speaker
mr.
franks,
are
you
taking
the
position
there
was
no
violation
of
a
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
raise
that
question
in
your
jurisdictional
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
arguing
that
even
as
of
today's
law
there
was
no
violation,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
franks,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
in
your
view
has
there
been
any
relevant
change
in
the
law
since
his
termination?
unknown
speaker
the
law
is
exactly
the
same
today
as
it
was
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
argue
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
law
as
construed
in
weisbrod,
or
do
you?
what's
your--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand
it
came
later,
but
would
you
say
if
that
had
come
out
before
that
there
would
have
been
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you'd
win
even
if
weisbrod
had
been
decided
before
this
all
happened.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
your
view
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
weisbrod
decision
under
this
court's
precedents?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
concede
or
agree
that
weisbrod
is
a
correct
statement
of--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
franks,
do
you
think
the
district
court
used
the
violation
of
state
regulations
by
the
state
official
as
an
element
of
the
violation
of
constitutional
rights
finding,
or
simply
as
a
denial
of
good
faith
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
is
left
to
base
the
damage
award
on?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
did
the
settlement
agreement
that
the
appellee
entered
into
say?
unknown
speaker
did
it
mention
the
section
1983
claims
or
the
basis
for
them?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
would
it
be...
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
the
administrative
regulation
were
perfectly
clear,
so
that
you
could
objectively
say
we
don't
have
the
problems
we
have
in
a
subjective
analysis
or
totality
of
the
facts
on
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
true
of
even
clearly
constitutional
rules.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
ever
deny
qualified
immunity
in
the
1983
based
on
clearly
established
state
law?
unknown
speaker
ever.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
need
to
make
the
argument
he
just
made.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
how
do
we
reach
that
question?
what...
if
the
district
court
vacated
its
holding
concerning
the
1977
statute
and
decided
instead
something
in
connection
with
the
1981
statute,
which
even
you
agree
was
error
for
it
to
do,
what's
left
for
it
to
base
a
damages
award
on
at
all?
unknown
speaker
under
the
federal
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but
not
under
some
state
law.
unknown
speaker
but
the
district...
the
district
court
really
didn't
rely
on
this
line
of
reasoning,
did
it,
because
if
it
had
relied
on
this
line
of
reasoning,
i
would
think
it
wouldn't
gotten
into
the
violation
of
a
state
regulation.
unknown
speaker
so
you're...
you're
really
arguing
here
for
an
alternative
basis
of
upholding
the
judgment,
not
on
the
reasoning
most
recently
advanced
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
other
side
of
that
coin,
i
take
it,
is
that
you
don't
defend
his...
his
amended
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
just...
just...
i
take
it
you
feel
some
uneasiness
about
defending
his--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
would
you
start
about...
on...
why
would
you
start
out
arguing
an
alternative
ground?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
law
he
said
was
clearly
established
he
ultimately
said
was
state
law.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
language...
what
was
that
language
you
just
quoted?
was
that
at
page
70
and
71?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
district
judge
finally
said
that
"although
the
issue
of
whether
a
clearly
established
constitutional
right
was
violated
must
be
resolved
against
the
plaintiff,
the
defendants
can
take
little
comfort.
"
and
then
he
goes
on
and
says
there's
an
alternative
ground
for...
for
denying
qualified
immunity.
and
they...
and
they
say
it's
because
general
order
43
clearly
established
an
employee's
right
to
a
complete
investigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
67...
i
don't
understand.
i
read
on
page
67a
that
he...
he
said
that
there
was
not
a
clearly
established
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
that
was
his
ultimate...
his
ultimate
holding
was
that
qualified
immunity
is
denied
because
there
was
a...
a
clearly
established
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
define...
you
don't
defend
that
part
of
it,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
what
we're
reviewing
here
is
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
right.
and
it...
and
it...
it
affirmed
per
curiam
precisely
what
i
just
read
you
out
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
we...
if
that
is
not
defensible,
it
seems
to
me
the
proper
recourse
would
be
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
disabuse
them
of
their...
of
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
we'll
let
them
decide
that.
unknown
speaker
did
harlow...
did
harlow
limit
itself
to
the
immunity
of
officers
performing
discretionary
functions?
unknown
speaker
in...
in
its
statement
of
the
rule
did
it?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
is
your
argument
here
as
to
why
this
particular
defendant
was
exercising
a
nondiscretionary
function?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
if
a
person's
function
is
claimed
to
be
nondiscretionary,
it
is
open
to
argument
by
the,
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
this,
that
a
state
regulation
made
the
duty
mandatory.
and
presumably
the
federal
judge
in
the
civil
rights
action
will
decide
whether
or
not
it
was
discretionary
then.
unknown
speaker
i
doubt
that
harlow
ever
intended
that.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
then
the
next
case
you're
going
to
get
is
one
where
the
language
isn't
that
clear,
and
you'll
be
arguing
in
the
1983
action
well,
it
doesn't
really
appear
mandatory,
but
it's
open
to
that
construction.
and,
you
know,
then
that
will
be
the
next
step
in
this
line,
which
i
think
would
erode
harlow.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
an
affirmed
judgment
below
that...
that
accepted
the
district
court's
declaration
of
unconstitutionality.
unknown
speaker
so
the
case
had
to
get
here
before
you
could
get
that
vacated.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
properly
here
on
appeal,
i
take
it,
is
what
you
first
argued.
unknown
speaker
just
because
he
concedes
that
you
ought
to
win
on
that
point
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
appellate
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
was
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
do
you
consider
that
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
