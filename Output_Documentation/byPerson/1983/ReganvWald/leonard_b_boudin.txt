mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
what
did
congress
have
in
mind.
i
do
this
before
i
come
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case,
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
liberty,
a
liberty
recognized
by
the
court
in
the
cases
ranging
from
kent
to
agee
and
even
califano,
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
but
i
thought
justice
o'connor's
question
really
was
directed
to
the
heart
of
the
case
here.
congress
did
not
direct
itself
to
the
four
countries
referred
to
by
my
good
friend
the
deputy
solicitor
general.
congress
was
concerned
about
two
things:
first,
the
broad
power
that
the
president
had
exercised
over
the
many
years
which
led
congress
to
pass
the
statute
under
consideration,
which
is
not
merely
the
grandfather
clause,
but
the
broad
statute
which
included
ieepa,
the
economic
control
act.
congress
in
doing
that
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
proliferated
emergencies
declared
by
the
president
over
the
years,
a,
were
either
outmoded
or
not
justified
and,
as
the
administrative
spokesman
stated
to
the
congress,
particularly
the
assistant
treasury
secretary,
there
was
no
emergency
at
the
time
that
congress
was
considering
ieepa.
and
as
the
administrative
spokesman
said,
without
an
emergency,
mr.
bergsten,
the
assistant
secretary
of
treasury
said,
"we
recognize
we
do
not
have
the
powers
to
carry
out
the
embargoes.
"
therefore,
congress
passed
this
very
broad
statute
which
was
upheld
in
ieepa,
in
which
congress
set
forth
a
procedure
bringing
the
president
into
the...
bringing
the
congress
into
the
consultative
operations
of
this
statute,
because
it
was
concerned
with
what
had
been
done
in
the
past.
now,
what
the
government
is
doing
here
is
acting
as
if
all
we
have
to
do
here
is
consider
what
i
will
consider
in
a
moment,
the
savings
clause,
and
it
forgets
the
dominant
purpose
of
the
legislation,
which
was
to
restrict
the
president,
and
that
the
savings
clause
was,
as
most
savings
clauses
are,
a
narrow
savings
clause
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
something.
and
that
really
is
the
question,
justice
o'connor:
what
were
they
trying
to
save?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
now,
if
one
looks
at
the
statements
made,
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
pointed
out
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
frade
case
which
came
to
the
same
conclusion,
one
sees
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
existing
uses.
and
you
see
there
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
our
brief
and
in
the
frade
opinion
a
reference
to
existing
controls,
existing
embargoes.
you
never
see
this
inchoate
conception
which
is
suggested
by
the
government
in
its
brief
and
argument.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
referring
specifically
to
the
language
used
by
the
congressmen--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--discussing
the
problem.
and
your
honors
will
see,
for
example
at
page
39
of
our
brief,
when
congressman
bingham
observed:
"if
the
president
has
not
used
up
to
now
some
authority
he
has
under
5(b),
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
necessary
to
give
him
authority
to
expand
what
has
already
been
done.
"
and
your
honors
will
see
the
references
made
by
congressmen
and
by
administrative
spokesmen
which
appear
at
the
bottom
of
page
39
of
our
brief
in
footnote
70,
when
they
talk
about
powers
currently
operative,
not
powers
inchoate,
not
powers
possessed,
powers
currently
operative;
and
then
when
they
refer
to
current
employment
of
controls.
this
is
everything
that
was
said
by
the
various
people
here,
and
you
do
not
find
any
support
for
the
suggestion
made
by
the
government
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
legislative
history.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
your
honors
will
see
from
our
brief,
a
proposal
was
made
to
give
the
power
to
the
government,
to
the
executive,
under
the
savings
clause,
precisely
the
one
which
is
suggested
by
my
friend
here...
an
old
friend,
i
may
say...
the
power
to
add
new
regulations,
new
controls.
and
that
legislation
would
have
added
another
paragraph
to
the
existing
statute,
which
is
that
the
president
can
exercise
not
only
the
authorities
being
exercised,
but
any
other
authority
conferred
upon
the
president
by
that
section
may
be
exercised
to
deal
with
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
and
then
came
the
very
important
colloquy
which
came
at
the
end,
not
in
the
early
stages
of
the
legislation,
as
the
government
suggests,
between
the
leading
representative
of
the
administration,
mr.
bergsten,
assistant
secretary
of
the
treasury,
when
he
was
asked:
"first
of
all,
mr.
bergsten,
would
it
be
your
understanding
that
section
101,
the
grandfather
clause,
would
strictly
limit
and
restrict
the
grandfathering
of
powers
currently
being
exercised
under
5(b)
to
those
specific
uses
of
the
authorities
granted
in
5(b)
being
employed.
"
--it
is
hard
to
find...
"as
of
june
1,
'77,
now
july
1?
"
mr.
bergsten
said:
"yes,
sir".
and
then
the
question
was:
"and
it
would
preclude
the
expansion
by
the
president
of
the
authorities
that
might
be
included
in
5(b)
but
are
not
being
employed
as
of
june
1,
1977?
"
and
he
says:
"that
is
right".
now,
in
fact,
on
july
1,
1977,
in
reality,
forgetting
about
whether
you
could
travel
on
this
plane
or
that
plane,
which
is
simply
a
question
of
mechanics,
in
reality
there
was
no
substantive
bar
to
travel
to
cuba.
i
will
take
up
in
a
moment
this
whole
conception
of
general
licenses.
but
in
fact
the
realities
of
the
situation
were
there
was
no
embargo
on
travel
to
cuba.
and
the
government's
petition
at
page
5,
as
i
recall
it,
original
petition
for
certiorari,
stated
what
is
our
view,
that
the
purpose
of
the
savings
clause
was
"to
continue
an
existing
embargo".
and
the
question
is,
was
there
an
embargo
on
travel
to
cuba?
there
were
difficulties,
but
were
those
an
embargo
on
travel
to
cuba,
and
the
answer
is
no.
and
i
would
consider
this
a
very
telling
argument
even
if
it
were
not
dealing
with
liberty.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
correct.
may
i
address
that?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government
actually
has
five
different
theories
of
what
the
exercise
of
authorities
means,
but
let
me
address
myself,
which
we've
talked
about
in
our
brief,
to
the
general
license
theory.
the
general
license
is
merely
a
convenient
device
for
withdrawing
controls
previously
in
existence,
and
your
honors
will
see
that
when
you
look
at
the
china
situation.
there
is
a
general
license
exempting
china
for
the
most
part
from
the
controls.
under
the
government
theory,
whatever
the
executive
is
now
doing,
that
general
license
is
a
control.
a
general
license
is
merely
a
technique.
when
you
have
a
broad
prohibition,
then
you
decide
not
to
carry
out
that
with
respect
to
particular
areas,
you
have
a
general
license.
and
the
best
illustration
would
be
if
i
were
to
take
an
alternative
way
to
handle
the
situation.
if
in
section
201,
which
forbids
financial
transactions...
and
i'm
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion
that
a
man
is
engaging
in
a
financial
transaction
with
respect
to
property,
although
i
have
some
hesitation
in
accepting
that.
the
statute,
section
201,
could
read
as
follows:
all
transactions
with
respect
to
property
in
which
cuba
has
an
interest
are
prohibited,
except
those
relating
to
travel.
now,
no
one
would
suggest
if
the
statute,
if
the
regulation
had
been
thus
written,
that
there
was
an
exercise
of
control
over
travel.
but
because
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
general
license,
the
government
suggests
that
somehow
or
other
they
are
giving
permission
to
exercise
this
liberty
of
travel.
but
what
they're
really
doing
in
the
general
license
technique
is
withdrawing
it,
withdrawing
the
prohibition
of
travel
from
the
transactional
area.
this
of
course
brings
to
mind
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
dames
against
moore.
dames
against
moore...
dames
&
moore,
excuse
me,
against
regan
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
general
license
issued
and
the
government's
contention,
upheld
by
the
court...
and
i
may
say
by
me
supporting
the
government
in
that
case...
was
that
where
the
president
had
attached
assets,
or
rather
frozen
assets,
and
then
released
them
and
allowed
them
to
be
subject
to
attachments,
the
president
by
virtue
of
a
later
provision
was
able
to...
was
able
to
recover
the
assets
and
use
them
the
way
he
did.
but
in
dames
against
moore
there
was
no
grandfather
clause.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
meaning
of
the
grandfather
clause,
and
the
grandfather
clause
was
intended,
as
the
two
courts
that
i
referred
to
indicated,
was
intended
to
allow
only
those
prohibitions
that
were
in
effect.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
it
was
intended
to
do
that,
aside
from
the
language,
which
is
uniform,
as
your
honors
will
see.
it
is
precisely
because
the
congressmen
who
were
in
charge
of
this
and
the
administrative
spokesmen
recognized
that
they
were
attempting
to
save
something,
to
save
the
embargoes
in
existence,
and
most
important,
to
save
the
assets
which
were
under
embargo,
to
save
those
from
being
given
away,
because
it
was
recognized
there
would
be
dealings
with
cuba
and
with
other
countries
eventually.
but
more
than
that
it
is
not,
because
the
continuation...
and
this
is
the
key
problem
with
the
government's
position...
the
continuation
under
the
savings
clause
of
those
controls,
those
embargoes,
was
not
predicated
upon
an
emergency,
it
was
predicated
upon
a
non-emergency,
and
it
is
because
of
that
that
we
have
to
give
a
limited
interpretation
to
those
words
in
the
savings
clause.
now,
when
we
consider
the
government's
argument
of
flexibility,
an
argument
which
this
court
of
course
upheld
in
dames
&
moore,
that
was
flexibility
under
ieepa,
the
economic
control
act,
subject
to
the
control
which
congress
had
and
exercised
in
that
real
emergency
of
consultation
with
the
president.
flexibility
is
of
course
necessary
in
foreign
relations,
and
that's
why
ieepa
was
passed.
flexibility
is
not
necessary
in
connection
with
the
savings
clause,
because
the
savings
clause
is
based
upon
a
narrow
area
which
cannot
be
justified
on
an
emergency
basis.
and
mr.
bergsten
recognized
and
mr.
katz,
from
another
department
of
the
government,
in
testifying
recognized
that
there
might
not
be
constitutional
validity
even
to
those
things
being
grandfathered,
because
there
was
no
emergency.
so
that
whether
we
take
the
conception
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
what
was
prohibited.
and
again,
just
to
remember
what
we
said
about
general
licenses,
lest
the
conceptual
thing
overlook
the
reality
here,
in
the
china
situation,
which
the
government
says
it's
troubled
about
answering,
in
the
china
situation
where
there's
a
general
license
permitting
everything,
we
could
restore
that,
if
we
wanted
to,
under
the
grandfather
clause.
now,
i
do
want
to
address--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--a
continuing
national
interest,
rather
than
emergency.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't...
yes,
your
honor
is
quite
right.
i
don't
think
he
did
it.
i
assume
he
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
china.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'll
accept
that.
now,
i
want
to
remind
the
court
what
the
government
has
done
here.
the
government
has,
in
contrast
to
the
rather
clear-cut
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
and
the
eleventh
independently...
your
honors
will
read
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
i
trust,
in
the
eleventh
circuit...
the
government
gives
four
or
five
different
possible
interpretations
of
the
grandfather
clause,
itself
making
each
one
suspect,
although
not
conclusively
so,
of
course.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
know
that
the
government
made
that
point.
i
think
we
and
the
courts
below,
both
courts,
courts
of
appeals,
eleventh
and
the
first,
are
of
the
opinion
that
if
there
is
a
substantive
control
being
exercised
by
regulation...
that
may
be
the
thing
that
was
confusing...
a
substantive
control
being
exercised
over
travel
or
over
anything,
that
control
could
be
continued
by
the
grandfather
clause.
we
do
not
differ
with
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
remember
what
the
government
has
said,
if
your
honors
please:
we
believe
that
one
possible
reading
of
the
grandfather
clause
is...
rather
an
odd
way
to
find
a
clear-cut
statute
involving
a
basic
liberty
like
the
right
to
travel.
the
first
argument
is
that
if
any
5(b)
authority
is
exercised,
the
government
preserves
all
5(b)
authorities.
the
second
argument
is
that
under
any
exercise
of
a
5(b)
authority,
referring
to
the
statute
now,
with
respect
to
property,
then
everything
can
be
exercised.
we
pointed
out
in
our
answering
brief
that
there
was
a
problem
raised
with
the
government's
two
views,
and
the
main
problem
was
that
with
respect
to
many
countries,
not
merely
the
four
that
the
government
now
targets,
although
there
was
no
indication
they
were
to
be
targeted,
with
respect
to
many
countries
there
were,
a,
controls
under
5(b)
generally
and
controls
over
transactions.
so
the
government
came
back
with
its
general
license
theory
which,
as
i
have
indicated,
is
really
a
language
problem,
a
semantic
problem,
rather
than
dealing
with
the
reality.
and
with
respect
to
that,
i
trust
your
honors
will
look
at
the
house
committee
report
on
this
bill,
report
no.
95-459,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
but
i
regret
to
say
somewhat
elliptically,
because
that
house
report,
in
discussing
the
cuban
situation
after
it
discusses
a
number
of
other
countries,
at
page
6
says:
"under
the
cuban
assets
control
regulations,
all
transactions
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
are
similarly
prohibited.
"
--now,
there's
a
comma
after
that...
"with
certain
exceptions".
in
other
words,
they
are
prohibiting
certain
things,
but
the
exceptions
at
that
time
were
travel.
travel,
by
the
way,
is
separately
mentioned
by
professor
lowenfeld,
who
is
a
leading
spokesman,
scholarly
spokesman
at
least.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
general
license,
again
addressing
myself
to
questions
that
were
put
by
two
of
your
honors,
the
same
page
6
explains
my
position
and
the
court
of
appeals'
position
on
what
it
means
to
have
a
general
license,
not
that
it
means
that
you're
permitting,
that
you're
regulating
something;
it
means
you're
withdrawing
it
from
control.
and
here
are
the
words
used
on
page
6:
"on
may
8,
'71,
the
department
licensed
most...
most...
subsequent
transactions
with
china,
while
continuing
the
blocking
of
china
assets
in
u.s.
hands
before
that
date.
"
"this
had
the
effect
of
lifting.
"
--i
emphasize
the
word
"lifting"...
"the
united
states
trade
embargo
of
china.
"
now,
if
you
have
lifted
an
embargo...
i
think
we
and
the
government,
at
least
theoretically,
are
in
agreement.
if
you
have
lifted
the
embargo,
then
there
is
no
embargo.
and
there
was
no
embargo
on
july
1,
1977,
after
they
had
lifted
the
embargo.
i
have
not
addressed
myself,
because
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
raised
by
two
of
your
honors
in
asking
questions
of
mr.
bator,
of
other
considerations
in
connection
with
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
you
would
have
in
terms
of
general
tenets
of
construction
rather
simple.
a
savings
clause
is
normally
a
narrow
exception,
because
you
have
a
broad
remedial
purpose.
here
we
have
a
statute
which
involves
liberty
of
movement,
and
here
you
have
a
statute
with
very
serious
criminal
sanctions,
all
of
which
have
been
grounds
historically
for
considering
savings
clauses
and
all
statutes
in
a
narrow
way.
but
i
had
omitted
one
thing,
your
honors.
after
i
finished
with
the
general
license
view,
i
did...
the
government
did
come
in
in
its
answering
brief,
its
reply
brief,
with
a
new
theory,
and
that
was
the
one
that
mr.
bator
quite
properly
articulated,
since
it
was
the
newest
theory
of
the
government,
namely
four
countries
are
being
targeted.
four
countries.
it's
no
longer
the
original
theory
of
5
being
exercised
and
therefore
you
could
exercise
new
authorities;
no
longer
the
property
conception;
it's
no
longer
even
the
licensing
thing.
the
important
thing
is,
congress
had
in
mind...
i
can't
call
it
a
bill
of
attainder,
having
heard
yesterday's
argument.
congress
had
in
mind
four
countries.
well,
this
is
an
odd
situation.
so
you
have
a
flexibility
argument
that
they
would
recognize,
that
they
insist
upon
with
respect
to
four
countries,
and
you
have
another
standard,
namely
non-flexibility
with
respect
to
all
other
countries
of
the
world.
your
honors
will
read
or
have
read
the
legislative
history.
you'll
find
no
theory
under
which
congress
drew
a
line
between
"comprehensive
embargoes
and
embargoes
generally".
now,
as
far
as
ieepa
is
concerned,
one
of
course
has
to
ask,
not
under
my
theory
that
perhaps
ieepa
couldn't
control,
but
under
the
court
of
appeals'
implied
view
that
ieepa
applies,
why
the
government
doesn't
deal,
doesn't
go
under
ieepa.
they
didn't
want,
the
administration
spokesmen
and
the
congressmen
didn't
want,
for
the
continuation
of
the
old
controls
in
old
situations
to
have
to
have
an
application
under
ieepa.
but
ieepa
wa
passed
for
a
purpose.
it
was
passed
after
at
least
seven
years
of
study
by
the
congress.
it
was
passed
because
that's
what
congress
wanted
when
we
had
a
crisis
situation.
and
of
course,
the
government
claims
that
the
current
situation
is
a
quasi-emergency
or
emergency.
it
is
a
new
situation
which
they
say
has
arisen
since
1977,
to
when
a
new
administration
took
effect.
well,
if
this
is
a
new
situation,
if
this
is
an
emergency,
then
the
government
is
supposed
to
go
to
the
congress,
the
president
is
supposed
to
go
to
congress
and
consult
with
the
congress
on
the
ieepa
and
put
into
effect
these
regulations.
and
on
their
theory
that
this
is
a
serious
problem,
this
is
exactly
the
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind.
congress
didn't
intend
that
when
new
crises
arose
that
suddenly
congress...
the
president
could
disregard
the
ieepa
procedures.
seven
years
of
study
went
into
the
drafting
of
the
ieepa.
there
was
a
reason
for
it.
and
they
have
not
followed
that
procedure.
this
will
bring
me
very
briefly
to
three
other
points
that
have
been
made
in
our
brief
and
that
obviously
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
any
of
those
points,
although
i
think
it
considered
some
of
them
in
determining
the
general
interpretation,
the
narrow
interpretation
of
the
savings
clause.
the
first
relates
to
the
1978
statute.
the
1978
statute
was
passed
because
the
congress
was
not
satisfied,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
administration
wasn't
satisfied,
to
rest
merely
upon
president
carter's
removal
of
bars
to
travel
to
cuba.
and
the
reports
of
the
committees
in
charge
said,
we
don't
want
this
to
depend
upon
a
particular
administration's
policies
or
discretion.
great
prescience,
as
we
see.
and
they
were
concerned
about
liberty
of
movement,
and
they
said
so,
and
the
basic
helsinki
general
declarations,
which
are
not
statutory
of
course,
relating
to
freedom
of
movement.
now,
the
government
says
it
talks
about
the
secretary
of
state
and
it
talks
about
passports.
why
do
we
think
this
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
well,
the
reason
we
do
is
because
the
congress
was
concerned
about
protecting
liberty
of
movement.
if
it
directed
its
attention
to
the
secretary
of
state,
it
was
because
that
was
the
normal
way
in
which
travel
restrictions
were
imposed.
and
as
we
argued
in
laub,
and
as
we
argued
in
zemel,
as
we
argued
in
kent,
the
whole
history
of
travel
control
had
been
a
history
in
which
the
secretary
of
state
was
doing
his
job,
controlling
it,
sometimes
we
said
wrongly
sometimes
the
court
said
rightly;
and
treasury,
if
it
did
anything,
was
ancillary.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
your
honor
will
note
that
the
restrictions
were
never
restrictions
by
regulation
directed
specifically
to
travel,
and
i
have
suggested,
yes,
i
have
thought
that
twea
was
never
passed
to
control
travel
as
such.
i
do
recognize
that
every
time
the
secretary
of
state
gave
a
license...
sorry,
amended
a
passport...
by
removing
restrictions,
the
treasury
department
would
automatically...
and
i
say
automatically...
give
a
license
to
spend
money.
but
i
have
found
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
twea
that
suggests
that
that
statute
really
authorized
the
practice
even
of
the
treasury
in
connection
with
licensing.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course.
i
haven't
suggested
that.
i
have
suggested
that
historically
travel
was
never
contemplated
by
the
congress,
and
that
each
time
legislation
was
proposed
to
control
travel
nobody
ever
mentioned
the
treasury
department,
nobody
ever
mentioned
twea.
and
this
court
in
discussing
either
in
haig
or
in
laub,
in
discussing
travel
controls,
recognized
that
the
first
travel
control
statute
was
a
1918
statute,
not
the
1970
twea.
i
must
say
to
your
honor,
as
i
say,
we've
studied
this
problem
for
a
long
time.
it
is
a
murky
area.
i
cannot...
it's
probably
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
found
its
decision
upon
that.
let
me
address
finally
the
constitutional
issue.
i
don't
want
to
overlook
it.
we
raised
it,
that
the
court
consider
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
liberty
to
be
significant
in
interpreting
the
grandfather
clause,
and
that
is
this.
i
would
agree...
i
must
agree,
having
read
agee,
having
looked
at
a
few
other
cases
of
this
court
in
the
travel
area
and
elsewhere...
that
there
are
emergency
circumstances
under
which
travel
could
be
controlled,
forbidden,
but
not
this
one.
the
court
had
a
very
serious
nuclear
confrontation
problem
which
it
addressed,
with
the
consequent
dangers
to
american
citizens
traveling
to
cuba,
when
i
argued
zemel
against
rusk,
and
the
court
held
there,
not
that
the
president
could
prevent
the
travel,
but
it
said
that
the
president
could
not
be
compelled
through
the
secretary
of
state
to
validate
a
passport
for
travel
to
cuba.
then
came
haig
against
agee,
the
second
clear-cut
bar
on
travel,
but
of
an
individual.
and
the
court
is
aware
of
the
stipulations
made
by
congress
and
of
the
findings
made
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion
with
respect
to
the
great
danger
to
foreign
relations,
to
national
security,
in
the
possible
assassination
of
cia
agents.
given
those
facts,
i
may
say,
i
don't...
quite
aside
from
the
question
of
statutory
authorization,
i
don't
see
how
the
constitutional
power
of
the
government
could
be
challenged
to
meet
situations
such
as
haig
and
agee.
but
what
do
we
have
here
in
reality?
we
have
a
hypothetical
that
if
somebody
goes
to
cuba
with
his
dollars,
including
these
americans
who
have
never
violated
any
laws
at
all
and
who
are
perfectly
good
people,
if
somebody
goes
to
cuba
with
his
dollars,
that
money
will
someday
help
build
a
cuban
tourist
industry.
i'm
not
an
authority
on
how
to
build
an
industry,
including
a
tourist
industry,
but
i
suspect
it's
a
long
way
off
between
the
dollars
of
american
citizens
today
and
building
it.
and
that
industry
will
make
money,
and
with
that
money
they
will
eventually
be
able
to
subvert
latin
america
against
american
interests.
now,
i
suggest
this
series
of
hypotheticals
is
far
too
tenuous,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
amount
of
money
which,
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
we
are
allowing
to
go
to
cuba
by
the
travel
that
is
permitted.
thank
you,
your
honor.
