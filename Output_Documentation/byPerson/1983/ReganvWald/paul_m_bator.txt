mr.
paul
m.
bator
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
questions
about
the
president's
authority
in
connection
with
national
emergency
economic
embargoes,
that
is,
in
connection
with
programs
of
comprehensive
control
on
financial
and
property
transactions
that
apply
to
a
few
countries
with
which
our
foreign
relations
are
in
a
state
of
very
special
and
acute
difficulty.
this
case
involves
cuba.
the
embargo
that
is
involved
here
is
very
much
like
the
iranian
assets
control
program
that
was
before
the
court
in
dames
&
moore,
and
the
case
involves
the
very
statute
considered
in
dames
&
moore,
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
of
1917
and
the
international
emergency
economic
powers
act,
which
is
known
as
ieppa>
["].
specifically,
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
validity
of
regulations
issued
in
1982
by
the
treasury
which
prohibit
certain
financial
transactions
incident
to
travel
to
cuba.
in
effect,
these
regulations
provide
that
americans
traveling
to
cuba
may
spend
money
for
cuban
goods
and
services
only
if
the
travel
involves
government
business
or
involves
journalism
or
involves
scholarly
research
or
a
visit
to
close
relatives,
or
if
it
is
authorized
by
a
specific
license
in
connection
with
humanitarian
activities
or
in
connection
with
sporting
or
artistic
exhibitions.
the
regulations
do
not
prohibit
travel
as
such.
you
are
free
to
go
to
cuba
if,
for
instance,
you
have
friends
or
relatives
who
invite
you
or
will
fund
you,
or
if
the
cuban
government
or
a
cuban
organization
will
fund
your
visit,
so
that
hard
currency
is
not
spent
in
cuba.
but
you
can't
spend
american
dollars
in
cuba
unless
you
fall
within
one
of
the
licensed
categories.
the
1982
regulations
here
modified
a
general
license
which
had
been
issued
by
president
carter
in
march
of
1977...
that's
an
important
date...
which
gave
permission
to
americans
to
spend
american
dollars
when
they
went
to
cuba.
now,
that
general
license
itself
was,
however,
subject
to
important
qualifications
on
the
flow
of
american
travel
dollars
to
cuba.
for
instance,
american
credit
card
companies
were
not
allowed
to
make
credit
card
arrangements
in
cuba,
and
that
made
it
harder
for
americans
to
travel
on
credit.
perhaps
more
significant,
travelers
who
wanted
to
go
to
cuba
under
that
general
license
pretty
much
had
to
arrange
for
charter
travel,
because
financial
transactions
in
connection
with
any
scheduled
voyages
to
cuba
were
not
permitted
by
that
license.
both
the
'77
license
and
the
'82
modifications
were
part
of
the
overall
cuban
assets
control
regulations,
regulations
that
continuously
since
1963
have
subjected
all
economic
transactions
between
americans
and
cuba
or
cubans
to
a
comprehensive
system
of
licensure.
section
201(b)
of
the
cuban
assets
control
regulations
has
since
'63
provided
that
no
economic
transaction
in
which
cuba
has
any
interest
may
go
forward
without
a
license
from
the
treasury,
so
that
by
the
terms
of
regulation
201(b)
it
has
been
unlawful
since
1963
to
spend
american
dollars
in
connection
with
travel
to
cuba
unless
you
had
a
treasury
license.
now,
from
'63
to
'77
these
licenses
were
issued
on
an
individual
basis
to
particular
individuals.
then
in
'77
came
the
general
license,
which
was
in
turn
modified
in
1982.
the
legal
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
valid
legal
authority
for
the
1982
modifications.
the
cuban
assets
control
regulations
were
themselves
issued
under
section
5(b)
of
the
twea,
trading
with
the
enemy
act,
which
broadly
authorizes
the
president
during
war
or
during
peacetime
declared
national
emergencies
to
use
rules
or
regulations
or
licenses
to
regulate
or
prohibit
any
transaction
involving
any
property
in
which
cuba...
in
which
a
foreign
country
or
a
foreign
national
has
any
interest.
now,
as
explained
in
our
briefs,
the
question
in
the
case
arises
because
the
twea
was
amended
by
congress
in
december
of
1977
to
apply
generally
only
during
wartime.
peacetime
economic
embargoes
in
connection
with
future
national
emergencies
were
switched
by
congress
onto
a
different
statutory
track
under
a
new
statute,
ieepa.
ieepa
gave
the
president
pretty
much
the
same
substantive
authority
as
he
had
under
the
twea.
in
fact,
ieepa
replicates
the
section
5(b)
twea
language
relevant
to
this
case.
but
ieepa
lays
down
new
procedures
and
new
predicates
for
the
exercise
of
those
peacetime
powers.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
major
standing
embargoes
in
'77
were
cuba,
north
korea,
vietnam
and
cambodia.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
was...
the
china
situation
is
complicated.
there
was
a
general
assets
embargo,
but
it
had
been
pretty
much
reduced
to
an
assets
freeze
by
the
time
of
the
statute
through
general
licenses,
so
that
the
china
situation
was
very
different
from
these
four
comprehensive
ones
in
terms
of--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
china
situation
to
us
is
the
most
difficult
or
the
most
borderline
one
as
to
what
exactly
was
grandfathered
and
what
congress
had
in
mind.
the
china
issue
is
pretty
much
moot
by
the
fact
that
the
whole
embargo
was
taken
off
when
the
general
settlement
was
made
with
china
somewhat
later.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it's...
the
government
simply
has
not
taken
a
position,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
legislative
intent
with
respect
to
china
is
clear
enough
to
warrant
reimposition.
of
course,
it
couldn't
be
reimposed
now
because
the
whole
assets
situation...
there
would
be
no
continuity
now,
since
there
was
a
general
takeover.
so
that
as
of
how
that
issue
really
is
moot.
that
is,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
grandfather
clause
authorizes
the
reimposition
of
embargoes
which
have
been
completely
eliminated.
as
justice
o'connor
question
indicates,
the
problem
of
this
case
arises
because,
although
congress
switched
new
national
emergency
embargoes
onto
the
ieepa
track,
future
ones,
at
the
same
time
it
did
grandfather
the
existing
embargoes.
congress
decided
that
it
did
not
want
to
force
the
president
to
issue
new
national
emergency
declarations
under
ieepa
in
order
to
continue
the
four
existing
embargo
systems
in
operation
in
1977,
and
therefore
it
specified
in
the
grandfather
clause
that
twea
authorities
which
were
being
exercised
on
july
1,
1977,
could
continue
to
be
exercised
as
long
as
the
president
makes
an
annual
determination
that
that
is
in
the
national
interest.
and
presidents
carter
and
reagan
have
each
year
made
that
determination.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
the
president
was
without
authority
in
1982
to
modify
the
1977
general
license
which
governed
the
flow
of
hard
currency
to
cuba,
because
it
reasoned
that
the
'77
general
license
permitted
many
trave-related
financial
transactions;
it
was
issued
a
few
months
before
the
july
1,
'77,
cutoff,
and
therefore
it
concluded
that
the
authority
to
regulate
those
transactions
was
simply
not
being
exercised
at
all
on
that
date.
the
government
believes
that
the
most
substantial
question
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
the
proper
scope
of
the
grandfather
clause,
and
that
president
carter's
1977
general
license
is
perhaps
a
good
starting
point
for
the
analysis
of
that
issue.
as
i
said,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that,
since
the
march
'77
general
license
authorized
most
travel-related
expenditures,
it
follows
that
the
authority
to
regulate
them
was
not
being
exercised.
but
we
think
that's
a
complete
non
sequitur
and
that
it
is
based
on
a
misunderstanding
of
the
structure
of
the
cuban
assets
control
program.
we
think
the
authority
to
regulate
financial
transactions
incident
to
travel
was
being
exercised
on
that
date
at
four
different
levels.
first,
we
have
regulation
201(b),
which
prohibited
all
property
transactions
unless
licensed.
this
represented
an
underlying
exercise
of
authority
to
demand
licensure,
and
that
has
been
continuously
asserted
since
1963.
second,
the
general
license
gave
permission
to
engage
in
transactions
incident
to
travel,
but
against
the
background
of
regulation
201(b).
we
think
this
was
an
act
of
regulation,
not
of
deregulation.
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
assumed
that
the
exercise
of
an
authority
to
regulate
only
goes
on
at
such
times
when
the
activity
is
prohibited.
but
we
think
that's
a
false
picture.
it
distorts
the
nature
of
a
system
of
licensure.
regulatory
authority
does
not
simply
vanish
when
it
is
exercised
to
license
an
activity,
and
this
point
is
made
very
plain
by
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
grandfather
clause
doesn't
authorize
the
preservation
simply
of
prohibitions
on
the
books.
it
authorizes
the
reservation
of
authorities
being
exercised
under
5(b),
and
5(b)
specifies
that
its
authorities
include
the
power
to
regulate,
"regulate"
by
means
of
"licenses".
so
to
us
the
message
is
quite
clear.
congress
was
referring
to
the
continuation
of
a
licensing
system,
an
ongoing
licensing
system,
which
of
course--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
there
are
countervailing
intonations
and
quite
often
rather
loose
language
in
the
legislative
history.
congress
was
torn
by
the
fact
that
it
wanted
to
accomplish
two
ends:
one,
to
narrow
the
president's
authority
to
use
these
peacetime
embargoes;
on
the
other
hand,
very
clearly
to
allow
the
president
to
continue
to
operate
these
existing
embargoes.
that
really
was
the
compromise.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
in
our
brief
we
do
indicate
that
there
are
passages,
although
they
are
not
as...
we
would
be
happier
if
they
were
clearer,
but
we
think
there
are
in
fact
specific
examples
in
the
legislative
history
where
it
was
indicated
that
what
would
be
grandfathered
was
an
embargo
system,
not
simply
a
kind
of
frozen
list
of
specific
prohibitions,
because
there
was
no
reference,
certainly
no
reference
to
anything
involving
the
fact
that
travel
was
not
to
be
regulated.
there
is
no
specific
indication
of
that
in
the
history
of
the
grandfather
clause.
congress
must
have
been
aware,
your
honor,
that
assets
controls
programs
generally
have
been
ongoing
and
rather
flexible
systems,
subject
to
adjustment
from
time
to
time.
there
is
another
point
here,
which
is
that
travel
in
fact
was
being
regulated
at
that
time
because
the
'77
license,
general
license,
did
include
some
specific
regulations
and
prohibitions
on
financial
transactions.
now,
that
fact,
of
course,
must
be
a
major
embarrassment
to
the
respondents'
theory
of
this
case.
it's
ignored
in
their
brief,
ignored
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
raises
a
very
important
question.
on
july
1,
'77,
president
carter
was
in
fact
prohibiting
certain
financial
transactions
incident
to
personal
travel,
including
all
transactions
incident
to
scheduled
travel.
now,
how,
in
light
of
that,
can
it
be
said
that
the
authority
to
regulate
travel-related
financial
expenditures
was
not
being
exercised?
i
remind
the
court,
too,
that
the
'77
general
license,
which
is
so
critical
to
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
of
this
case,
was
explicitly
by
regulation
subject
to
revocation
and
modification,
and
in
that
respect
we
think
this
case
is
governed
and
controlled
by
dames
&
moore,
because
in
dames
&
moore
the
court
explicitly
held
that
a
general
license
subject
to
revocation
is
a
contingent
instrument,
subordinate
to
the
president's
continuing
underlying
regulatory
authority,
and
that
reasoning
seems
to
us
compelling
here.
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
i
think
is
really
the
heart
of
the
case.
what
could
congress
have
had
in
mind
when
they
grandfathered
this?
we
think
that
it
is
simply
an
incoherent
account
of
what
congress
could
have
meant
to
suppose
that
they
were
simply
freezing
an
existing
laundry
list
of
specific
prohibitions.
we
don't
think
this
is
a
sensible
or
a
credible
reading.
i
don't
think
congress
could
have
wished
to
freeze
the
north
korean
and
the
vietnamese
and
the
cuban
embargoes
so
that
the
president
couldn't
fill
in
loopholes
or
gaps,
that
he
couldn't
clarify
coverage,
that
he
couldn't
add
a
restriction,
for
instance,
in
connection
with
a
negotiation
to
create
an
incentive
for
settlement.
the
ironic
thing
actually
is
that
under
the
court
of
appeals'
reading
the
executive
may
even
be
disabled
from
amending
an
embargo
to
implement
a
negotiated
settlement
with
another
country,
because
that
settlement
might
call
for
the
addition
of
new
5(b)
measures,
as
indeed
happened
in
the
iranian
settlement.
again
perhaps
for
example
to
look
at
the
general
license,
it's
an
interesting
example,
because
when
it
was
first
issued
in
march
of
'77
it
did
not
include
the
restriction
on
financial
transactions
incident
to
scheduled
travel.
that
was
added
in
may
of
'77.
now,
suppose
it
had
been
added
in
august
rather
than
in
may.
is
it
conceivable
that
the
president
would
have
been
disabled
from
making
it?
that
was
obviously
an
afterthought
or,
if
you
will,
the
filling
in
of
something
that
was
just
overlooked.
but
that
kind
of
adjustment
could
not
be
made,
we
don't
think
that
it
creates
a
coherent
system.
now,
the
court
of
appeals'
answer
to
this
was,
use
ieepa.
but
to
use
ieppa
requires
the
president
to
issue
a
new
national
emergency
declaration,
and
a
declaration
that
cuba
or
vietnam
represents
an
unusual
or
extraordinary
threat
to
the
united
states.
and
justice
o'connor,
if
there's
anything
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
it
is
that
the
congress
was
persuaded
by
the
administration
in
this
compromise
that
it
would
be
undesirable
and
awkward
to
force
the
president
to
declare
such
a
new
emergency
and
make
such
a
statement
in
order
to
maintain
these
four
extraordinary
embargoes.
the
purpose
of
congress
to
allow
the
president
to
maintain
these
four
extraordinary
embargoes
without
declaring
a
new
national
emergency
would
simply
be
frustrated
if
what
we
say
is
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
preserved
is
a
frozen
list
of
restrictions,
that
is,
that
a
new
declaration
has
to
be
made
every
time
there
is
an
adjustment
or
a
gap
filled
or
a
new
restriction
imposed
in
order
to
create
a
bargaining
chip.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
is
a...
we
did
not
discover
the
fact
that
there
was
a...
that
is,
we
used
the--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no.
there
was
a
change
made
in
may
of
'77
from
march
of
'77.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
have
to--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i'm
relying
on
the
fact
that,
although
that
happened
before
the
cutoff--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
july
cutoff,
that
it's
simply
a
routine
example
of,
if
you
will,
second
thoughts
in
connection
with
ongoing
administrative
regulations.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
would
just
want
to
say
that
i'm
not...
i
could
go
back,
but
i
think
that
subsections
(4),
(5),
and
(6),
certainly
(4)
and
(5),
were
added
in
may
rather
than
in
march,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
they're
put
in
an
odd
way,
but
what
they
add
up
to
when
you
come
down
to
it
in
the
end
is
the
creation
of
a
rule
which
says
that
you
cannot
expend
any
moneys
in
connection
with
scheduled
trips.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
most
of
the
material
on
11(a)
was
added
in
may
rather
than
in
march.
i
don't
take
that
as
a
fundamental
argument,
your
honor.
it
just
gives
a
clue
to
how
these
programs
in
fact
are
managed
and
that
there
is
a
constant
system
of
adjustments
and
repairs.
i
want
to
say
a
word...
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left...
about
the
passport
act
of
1978.
that's
a
statute
which
the
respondents
say
forbids
the
use
of
twea
authorities
or
ieepa
authorities.
even
if
they
did
exist
and
even
if
twea
authorities
were
grandfathered,
they
say
that
the
passport
act
of
'78
revoked,
restricted,
prohibited
the
president
from
regulating
expenditures
incident
to
personal
travel.
they
say
that
expenditures
to
personal
travel
are
simply
now
a
special
category
which
may
not
be
regulated
under
these
comprehensive
embargoes.
we
think
this
reading
would...
in
fact,
we
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
what
congress
on
that
reading,
what
congress
was
doing
in
'78
was
invalidating
the
'77
general
license
with
its
restrictions.
we
think
that
this
reading
means
that
president
carter
violated
the
passport
act
when
in
1980
he
used
ieepa
to
control
expenditures,
to
prohibit
expenditures
in
connection
with
travel
to
iran.
and
the
point
is
significant
to
us
because
the
carter
administration
was
instrumental
in
the
passport
act
of
'78.
nevertheless,
president
carter
clearly
assumed
that
the
passport
act
did
not
override
this
preexisting
separate
power
to
regulate
travel
expenditures
in
the
context
of
comprehensive
assets
embargoes.
and
we
think
that's
the
natural
assumption.
the
passport
act
says
nothing
about
economic
or
financial
transactions.
it
says
nothing
about
anything
except
the
regulation
of
passports.
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
was
overriding
an
independent,
long-standing
regulatory
power
to
restrict
the
flow
of
financial
and
economic
benefits
to
countries
which...
and
i
want
to
remind
the
court,
the
few
countries
with
which
by
hypothesis
our
relations
are
in
a
state
of
acute
difficulty.
the
respondents
speak
as
if
it
were
somehow
inconceivable
that
congress
could
say
that
passports
must
be
issued
on
the
one
hand
and
yet
that
the
president
could
continue
to
exercise
an
authority
to
restrict
the
flow
of
american
dollars
from
american
travelers
abroad.
but
there's
nothing
inconceivable
about
it.
it's
an
absolute
commonplace
of
modern
public
policy
in
many
countries...
england
and
france...
that
have
created
fiscal
restrictions
on
the
expenditure
of
travel
moneys,
without
in
any
way
aiming
at
travel
as
such
or
trying
to
restrict
the
liberty
of
the
citizens
to
travel.
and
we
do
not
credit
the
respondents'
suggestion
that
the
twea
on
our
reading,
the
grandfathered
authority,
can
be
used
to
negate
the
passport
act.
we're
talking
about
four
grandfathered
embargoes.
we're
talking
about
the
regulation
of
travel
expenditures
as
a
subsidiary
element
in
the
context
of
comprehensive
assets
programs.
we
think
that's
simply
a
different
subject
than
the
subject
of
the
regulation
of
passports.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
have
a
few
points
i'd
like
to
make.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
mr.
boudin
and
the
government
are
in
happy
agreement
on
what
the
central
issues
are.
the
question
is
what
congress
meant
by
the
grandfather
clause.
that
in
turn
depends
crucially
on
what
the
situation
was
in
'77
with
respect
to
the
authorities
being
exercised
under
the
twea.
mr.
boudin
takes
this
whole
bundle
of
complex
authorities,
which
include
the
general
regulation
201(b),
the
restricted
general
license,
the
fact
that
that
restricted
license
is
subject
to
revocation
and
modification,
and
he
just
says
that
all
adds
up
to
total
deregulation,
and
he
says
a
general
license
in
general
is
nothing
but
an
administrative
technique
for
deregulation.
but
the
very
first
exercise
of
power
to
regulate
travel-related
transactions
under
the
twea
in
1940
by
president
roosevelt,
in
connection
with
remittances
abroad,
to
travelers
abroad,
was
by
way
of
a
general
license
and
asserted
the
authority
to
restrict
expenditures
over
$250
a
month.
if
this
court
will
read
its
own
opinion
in
dames
&
moore,
it
will
see
that
there
was
a
general
license
in
that
case
and
it
was
not
simply
an
administrative
technique
which
receded
and
said,
we
are
no
longer
exercising
the
power
to
regulate.
it
is
simply
a
contingent
and
subordinate
instrument.
now,
mr.
boudin
read
a
sentence
from
the
house
report
which
said
that
in
connection
with
china
the
structure
of
the
situation
did
look
as
if
the
authority
to
regulate
had
been
reduced
to
a
very,
very
narrow
point,
and
that
is
why
we
have
this.
we
are
troubled
by
the
question
as
to
what
the
grandfather
clause
would
have
implied
for
china
if
that
question
were
still
a
live
question
today.
but
the
very
question...
the
very
sentence
that
mr.
boudin
read
you
is
followed
by
the
following
sentence.
after
"this
had
the
effect
of
lifting
the
u.s.
trade
embargo
of
china.
"
it
then
goes
on
and
says:
"however,
the
embargoes
of
north
korea,
vietnam,
cambodia,
and
cuba
continue.
"
"second.
"
the
report
continues,
"under
the
cuban
assets
control
regulations
all
transactions
between
the
united
states
and
cuba
are
similarly
prohibited,
with
certain
exceptions.
"
that
is,
the
structure
that
is
suggested
here
is
quite
different.
it's
suggested
that
the
general
regulation
continues,
but
subject
to
exceptions.
it's
not
a
statement
about
deregulation.
mr.
boudin
objects
to
the
fact
that
we
think
the
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
targets
these
four
countries.
the
very
last
thing
mr.
bingham
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
was
that
"this
legislation"...
that
is,
that
he
said
about
the
grandfather
clause
was,
he
says
on
the
floor
of
the
house:
"this
legislation
specifically
grandfathers
the
embargoes
against
vietnam,
cambodia,
laos
and
cuba,
and
other
existing
embargoes,
so
that
they
are
not
affected
in
any
way
by
this
legislation.
"
the
one
he
dropped
from
there
was
north
korea.
so
it
is
targeted,
and
he
says
they
are
not
affected
in
any
way.
now,
one
further
quick
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
congress
i
think
was
persuaded
in
1977
that
these
four
situations
were
extraordinary
and
that
special
powers
needed
to
be
maintained
to
allow
the
president
to
conduct
a
credible
and
serious
foreign
policy
with
respect
to
these
four
extraordinary
situations.
it's
the
statute
that
says
that
the
president
does
not
need
to
make
a
new
emergency
declaration
in
connection
with
these
four
embargoes.
that
doesn't
mean
that
our
relations
with
these
countries
have
not
and
cannot
from
time
to
time
reach
very
acute
and
difficult
circumstances.
the
fact
that
the
president
has
not
formally
declared
a
new
state
of
emergency
with
cuba
has
no
probative
effect
on
what
is
the
state
of
our
relations
with
cuba
as
long
as
it
is
true,
as
the
president
was
persuaded
is
true,
that
he
has
authority
to
continue
to
administer
these
embargo
systems
because
of
the
extraordinary
situation
that
persists
with
these
four
countries.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
there
are
very
special
and
specific
prohibitions,
there
were
in
'77
under
twea,
with
respect
to
the
export
of
what
i
believe
are
described
as
strategic
items
to
certain
countries.
and
we
assume
that
those
are
continued
in
place
under
twea
and
they
may
be
maintained
without
a
new
ieepa.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
do
not
think,
we
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
fair
reading
of
this
legislation
to
use
those
as
a
springboard
for
a
comprehensive
assets
program.
we
have
never
maintained
that.
unless
there
are
further
questions--
