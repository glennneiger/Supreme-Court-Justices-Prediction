mr.
bator,
what
other
countries
were
there
at
the
time
of
the
grandfather
clause
enactment
which
our
government
had
a
broad
prohibition
on
unlicensed
property
transfers?
unknown
speaker
how
about
china?
unknown
speaker
but
arguably
within
the
same
authority--
unknown
speaker
--but
under
your
theory
perhaps
could
be
restored,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
message
was
as
clear
in
the
minds
of
congress
as
it
is
to
you
from
looking
at
the
structure
of
the
legislation?
certainly
there
are
expressions
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
indicate
that
members
of
congress
may
have
had
a
different
view
and
that
they
were
really
concerned
about
thinking
that
the
authorities
then
being
exercised
were
being
grandfathered
in,
but
nothing
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
haven't
spotted
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
clearly
indicates
that
the
members
of
congress
were
as
aware
of
the
structure
that
you
propose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
change
in
may
of
1977
of
the
general
license.
i'm
not
quite
clear
as
i
look
at
the
material
at
the
very
end
of
your
brief
where
you
quote
the
version
of
the
asset
control
regulation
at
10(a)
on.
you
say
that's
what
was
in
effect
from
march
'77
through
may
of
'82.
does
that
include
the
may
'77
amendment
or
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
used
something
post-may
of
'77
to
come
here?
unknown
speaker
what
part...
where
do
i
find
that
in
10(a)
to
12(a)?
what
is
new
in
there,
because
i'm
just
not--
unknown
speaker
--it's
a
rather
critical
part
of
your
argument,
because
you're
relying
on
that
as
evidence
of
the
ability
to
make
the
regulations
tougher.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
have...
i
can
follow
at
the
appropriate
time.
unknown
speaker
but
they
seem
to
be
authorizations
rather
than
restrictions.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it's
an
authorization
of
all
kinds
of
travel
except
scheduled
trips?
unknown
speaker
well,
right,
and
we
have
to
focus
on
the
legislative
history--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
coverage
of
the
grandfather
clause.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boudin,
are
you
referring
to
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
by
the
congress.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
boudin,
but
they
take
the
position
that
there
was
in
effect
the
general
prohibition
on
financial
transactions,
regulation
201(b).
unknown
speaker
please.
unknown
speaker
as
to
china
that's
not
right,
is
it?
don't
you
have...
doesn't
the
president
have
to
make
an
annual
declaration
of
a
continuing,
to
keep
the
authority
alive?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
not
do
that
with
respect
to
china,
so
that
could
not
be
revived.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say
in
the
briefs
he
didn't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boudin.
unknown
speaker
your
brief
struck
me
as
somewhat
different
in
theory
than
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
was
i
wrong
in
thinking
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
none
of
the
restrictions
ever
issued
under
the
twea
from
the
time
of
its
passage
had
any
effect
on
the
control
of
travel?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
authorizes
the
restriction
and
control
of
property
in
the
hands
described,
and
if
the
regulation
affects
the
property
the
fact
it
has
an
incidental
effect
on
travel
doesn't
make
it
illegal
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
may
i
ask
just
one
question
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about.
apart
from
these
four
countries,
just
in
other
parts
of
the
world,
as
i
understand
it
there
are
certain
kinds
of
property
transactions
that
are
prohibited
by
the
president.
and
are
those
prohibitions
also
pursuant
to
the
twea,
and
if
so
to
what
extent
do
they
survive
and
is
there
any
flexibility
under
your
theory
for
changes
in
those?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
not--
