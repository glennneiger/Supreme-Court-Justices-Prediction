mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
submission
as
amicus
curiae
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
applied
the
due
process
clause
to
prevent
the
forum
shopping
attempted
by
plaintiff.
forum
shopping
in
multi-state
defamation
cases
poses
a
very
real
danger
to
the
values
of
our
federal
system.
it
permits
a
plaintiff
who
sleeps
on
her
rights
to
sue
in
any
state
which
has
the
longest
statute
of
limitations,
effectively
making
that
statute
nationwide
and
scope
and
overriding
the
policies
of
the
other
states
having
a
paramount
interest
in
the
parties
and
in
the
litigation.
this
case
vividly
illustrates
that
danger.
plaintiff
here--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
the
parties,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
would
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
states
that
have
the
paramount
interest
are
new
york
and
ohio,
the
states
of
residence,
and
also
those
are
the
states
where
the
damage
from
the
libel
principally
occurred.
we
say
these
are
the
states
with
a
paramount
interest,
and
these
are
the
states
where
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
one
would
think
that
the
court
should
do
such
a
thing,
and
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
do
so,
but
the
law
in
new
hampshire
is
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
procedural
in
nature,
and
that
the
court
therefore
applies
its
own
local
statute
of
limitations,
bringing
back
to
life
a
tort
action
that
is
dead
in
the
other
49
states
where
99
percent
of
the
damages
actually
arose.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
submit
that
the
choice
of
the
forum
here
for
the
purpose
of
escaping
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
49
other
states
is
indeed
a
jurisdictional
matter,
because
it
implicates
the
interests
of
the
other
49
states,
which
is
one
of
the
very
most
fundamental
concerns
of
the
due
process
clause,
and
imposes
burdens
on
the
party
and
the
judicial
system
that
are
unreasonable
burdens,
which
is
the
other
leg
of
the
due
process
analysis.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
suit
in
new
hampshire
has
been
dismissed.
there
was
a--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
don't
have
to
make
that
argument
for
this
reason.
this
suit
is
not
focused
on
damages
in
new
hampshire.
it
is
focused
on
damages
throughout
the
entire
united
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
this
case
was
filed
in
new
hampshire
just
for
new
hampshire
damages,
it
would
present
a
very
different
issue--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
take
that
as
a
finding
of
the
district
court,
that
she
had
no
reputation
of
any
sort
in
the
jurisdiction.
she
was
a
virtual
unknown
in
the
jurisdiction.
she
had
never
lived
there,
never
owned
any
property
there,
had
virtually
no
ties
with
the
forum.
if
she
did--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--not
necessarily.
i
say
that
is
a
closer
question,
because
it
still
has
elements
of
inconvenience.
there
still
is
a
question
about
the
palpability
of
the
state's
interest.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
because
the
purpose
of
this
lawsuit
is
to
recover
damages
in
all
50
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if
the
suit
was
focused
solely
on
damages
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
we
say
it
would
be
a
different
case,
and
it
may
be--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
say
that
that
is
a
fence
sitter
for
this
reason.
you
would
not
be
trampling--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
would
submit
in
that
case
that
there
may
well
be
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
limited
cause
of
action,
although
it
is
not
at
all
clear,
because
the
lack
of
state
interest
and
the
inconvenience
to
the
parties
is
present.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
nothing
but
a
general
allegation
of
$80
million
in
damages
throughout
the
united
states.
nothing
is
focused
on
the
state
of
ne
hampshire.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
there
were
affidavits
submitted,
your
honor,
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
show
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
had
an
interest
in
this
cause
of
action
that
was
filed
in
this
jurisdiction,
and
there
is
another
lack
of
evidence,
affidavits,
arguments
in
the
briefs
to
that
effect.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
that
would
be
inconsistent
first
with
the
single
publication
rule,
which
says
that
you
have
to
subsume
all
of
your
damages
in
a
single
piece
of
litigation.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
this
complaint,
which
is
seeking
$80
million
in
damages
for
nationwide
injury.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
disagree,
your
honor,
with
that
interpretation.
the
essence
of
this
holding
is
that
this
suit
is
intended--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor,
that
that
is
simply
not
the
holding
in
this
case.
if
another
pleading
were
filed
that
focused
in
exclusively
on
injuries
in
new
hampshire,
that
question
would
be
presented,
but
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
in
that
situation,
if
the
court
were
disposed
to
look
at
the
case
as
one
seeking
both
1
percent
of
the
damages
in
new
hampshire
and
90
percent
of
the
damages
in
other
jurisdictions,
if
the
court
were
to
do
that,
the
correct
constitutional
result
would
he
that
only
that
1
percent
of
the
damages
in
the
local
jurisdiction
could
be
collected,
because
collection
of
the
99
percent
from
the
rest
of
the
jurisdictions
would
infringe
the
statute
of
limitations
in
those
states.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
would
submit
that
if
the
court
wore
disposed
to
redraft
the
complaint
in
this
manner
to
make
it
a
new
hampshire
damage
proceeding,
and
to
remand
with
the
opinion
stating
that
only
damages
in
that
jurisdiction
are
constitutionally
collectible,
that
perhaps
would
be
a
constitutionally
permissible
result,
but
it
would
require
a
reformulation
of
the
complaint,
a
reformulation
of
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
said
initially
that
i
thought
that
that
was
a
much
closer
case.
i
am
not
persuaded
that
even
that
case
is
one
that
is
within
the
constitutional
power
of
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in
light
of
the
court's
analysis
of
this
question
and
discussion
of
the
question,
it
is
perhaps
worth
focusing
on
a
little
more.
i
am
very
doubtful
about
the
constitutionality
of
even
that
localized
proceeding,
even
though
that
hasn't
been
briefed,
even
though
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
complaint,
and
even
though
that
isn't
the
argument
of
my
brother,
mr.
grutman.
i
am
doubtful
about
it
because
the
parties
still
have
a
most
indirect
and
tenuous
connection
with
this
forum.
there
is
a
very
substantial
burden
o
them.
i
don't
think
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--those
copies,
by
the
way,
mr.
justice,
were
sent
through
an
independent
distributor
in
connecticut--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--were
sold
by
independent
retailers
and
wholesalers
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
did,
and
that
there
is
some
connection
with
the
forum
state.
i
don't
dispute
that.
however,
both
of
the
courts
below
correctly
characterized
it
as
a
tenuous
and
a
spars
connection.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
it
is...
there
is
no
presence
of
property
in
the
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
agent
in
the
jurisdiction.
there
is
merely
selling
products
in
the
jurisdiction,
like
the
rest
of
the
50
states
in
the
united
states,
and
to
say
that
this
is
a
substantial
continuous
presence
is
to
say,
as
mr.
grutman
did,
that
this
company
is
present
everywhere,
and
that
the
plaintiff
can
pick
and
choose
among
the
50
states
and
sue
in
hawaii
or
sue
in
alaska.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
answer
is,
mr.
justice,
that
we
are
talking
about
the
selection
of
a
reasonable
forum
to
litigate
this
particular
dispute,
and
that
requires
consideration
of
the
location
of
the
parties.
it
requires
a
consideration
of
the
interests
of
the
other
states
in
the
federal
system,
and
to
permit
this
lawsuit,
which
seeks
recovery
of
$80
million
for
damage
throughout
the
country
to
proceed,
runs
roughshod
over
the
policies
of
the
other
states
in
the
union.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
think
the
court
has
to
take
the
complaint
the
way
it
is
drafted
as
a
nationwide
libel
complaint
and
not
a
complaint
for
damages
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
as
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
even
doubtful
about
the
constitutional
validity
of
sustaining
this
merely
as
a
proceeding
to
collect
damages
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
in
light
of
the
burdens
on
the
parties
that
would
be
produced
by
this
sort
of
forum
shopping,
by
the
lack
of
direct
state
interest
compared
to
the
interests
of
new
york
and
ohio,
and
by
the
other
factors
that
this
court
mentioned
in
the
volkswagen
case,
which
i
would
like
to
enumerate.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
i
would
submit
that
compared
to
the
interests
of
the
states
with
predominant,
or,
i
say,
paramount
interest
in
the
suit
the
state
of
domicile
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
state
o
domicile
for
the
defendants
who
committed
this
allege
wrong,
that
any
such
interest
is
a
very
abstract
interest.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
that
that
interest,
although
it
is
possible
to
articulate
it,
is
not
a
sufficiently
substantial
interest
to
permit
this
overriding
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
49
other
states,
including
the
state
of
domicile
and
the
state
where
the
damage
occurred.
now,
undoubtedly
it
is
true
that
a
completely
unknown
person
who
has
unflattering
things
said
about
them
in
the
jurisdiction
would
experience
some
discomfort
about
this.
it
is
something
that
they
don't
want
to
occur.
but
if
you
compare
that
interest
to
the
interest
of
the
state
of
new
york,
where
she
lived,
had
her
reputation,
had
her
professional
relations
and
ties,
that
is
the
state
which
traditionally
under
common
law
principles
is
perceived
as
the
state
that
has
the
paramount
interest
in
a
multi-state
defamation
action.
there
is
a
body
of
law
on
this
subject.
it
is
not
just
a
matter
of
inferences
about
what
the
most
reasonable
forum
is.
according
to
the
restatement
of
conflicts,
the
states
that
have
a
real
palpable
interest
in
a
multi-state
defamation
proceeding
are
the
state
where
the
plaintiff
lives,
the
state,
if
there
is
another
state,
where
she
has
a
more
well
established
reputation,
such
as
the
state
where
she
works,
the
domicile
of
the
defendant,
because
the
state
is
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
local
residents,
and
the
principal
place
of
business
of
the
defendant.
these
are
the
logical
focuses
of
a
multi-state
defamation
case,
and
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
is
privileged
to
simply
sue
in
alaska
or
hawaii
or
any
other
state
in
the
union
without
regard
to
the
convenience
of
the
parties,
without
regard
to
where
the
witnesses
come
from,
which
is
here
in
new
york
and
ohio,
and
without
regard
to
the
needs
of
the
judicial
system,
where
a
jury
and
a
judge
would
have
to
sit
through
an
extensive
trial--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--is
to
invite
forum
shopping
on
the
grandest
scale.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
1401(a),
the
forum
non-convenience
statute,
has
been
traditionally
held
and
consistently
held
not
to
even
come
into
play
unless
personal
jurisdiction
is
established
in
the
forum,
and
here
we
say
the
choice
of
forum
is
so
unreasonable
and
the
burdens
are
so
great
and
the
disregard
of
the
interests
of
the
other
states
and
the
convenience
of
the
witnesses
is
so
great
that
the
forum
is
a
constitutionally
deficient
forum
initially,
and
that
you
can't
simply
transfer
a
case
under
section
1404.
it
has
to
be
dismissed.
and
one
of
the
undesirable
consequences
of
simply
permitting
a
transfer
under
1404
would
be
that
it
would
permit
forum
shopping
with
a
vengeance.
the
plaintiff
would
file
the
suit
in
the
state
with
the
longest
statute
of
limitations,
and
then
simply
have
the
case
transferred
back
to
her
place
of
residence,
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
longer
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
think
the
constitution
says
something
in
addition
to
this,
and
that
is
that
the
forum
has
to
be
a
reasonable
and
a
fair
forum
from
the
point
of
view
of
all
the
parties,
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
other
states
in
the
federal
system.
there
are
two
things
that
the
due
process
clause
guarantees,
a
fair
forum
for
the
parties
and
the
witnesses,
and
a
forum
which
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
needs
of
the
other
49
states
in
the
union.
these
are
the
factors.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
again,
that
is
a
closer
question.
i
am
not
sure
i
can
give
the
correct
answer
to
you,
but
it
would
certainly
remove
this
element
of
trampling
on
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
49
other
states.
that
would
be
gone.
but
it
would
still
be
an
extremely
inconvenient
forum.
the
defendants,
the
witnesses
are
all
domiciled
in
other
states.
the
defendant
is
an
individual
paraplegic
living
in
the
state
of
california.
highly
inconvenient
for
them.
and
it
is
inconvenient,
we
say,
for
the
federal
judiciary,
too,
to
require
a
local
court
and
a
local
jury
to
entertain
a
case
such
as
this,
an
extended
proceeding
in
which
there
is
no
palpable
local
concern,
and
this
is
a
factor
that
the
courts
mention.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
essentially
correct.
the
state
of
plaintiff's
residence
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
state
of
ohio,
which
was
the
place
of
business
and
the
domicile
of
the
defendants,
would
be
constitutionally
permissible
under
all
circumstances,
and
the
principal
place
of
business,
if
there
was
one.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
yes,
we
would.
the
restatement...
i
would
refer
the
court
to
th
restatement,
section
150,
which
has
a
very
good
discussion
of
which
states
really
do
have
a
palpable
interest
in
a
multi-state
defamation
case,
and
the
place
where
the
plaintiff
lives,
not
only
because
that
is
convenient,
but
because
that
is
a
state
that
really
has
an
interest
in
the
outcome,
and
the
state
where
the
defendant
resides,
and
the
state
where
the
defendant
has
principal
place
of
business.
there
is
an
additional
state
occasionally
if
the
plaintiff
works
in
another
state
and
her
reputation
is
better
developed
in
that
forum.
that
would
be
a
reasonable
selection
of
forum
in
this
instance,
too.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
court
treated
it
as
substantive
because
it
was
a
special
statutory
cause
of
action,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
was
a
precondition
to
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action.
that
is
why
it
was
treated
as
a
migratory
matter.
ordinarily--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
refers,
i
think,
to
a
different
cause
of
action.
it
is
the
cause
of
action
for
privacy,
whereas
this
is
a
cause
of
action
for
libel,
and
they
have
been
treated
as
separate
and
independent
causes
of
action,
so
i
wouldn't
press
the
res
judicata
argument.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
am
very
doubtful
about
that,
although
i
say
it
is
a
closer
question,
and
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--initially,
your
honor,
i
think
if
the
court
were
disposed
to
look
at
the
case
that
way,
if
it
were
to
say
in
the
opinion
that
damages
are
restricted
to
the
forum,
which
has
a
connection
with
the
parties,
that
would
be
a
substantial
contribution
to
this
body
of
law,
and
it
would
be
a
significant
holding,
but
if...
our
position
still
is
that
even
if
it
was
restricted
to
damages
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
that
there
are
very
serious
constitutional
questions
about
even
that,
because
it
is
such
an
unreasonable
choice
of
forum
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
parties
who
live
in
ohio
and
california
and
new
york--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--when
it
becomes
as
egregious
as
this--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
this
court
has
said
the
balance
of
inconvenience--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--due
process
clause,
fifth
amendment.
that
if
the
balance
of
inconvenience
is
sufficiently
severe--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes.
the
international
shoe
case.
if
the
balance
of
inconvenience
and
the
choice
of
forum
with
respect
to
the
interests
of
all
the
states
is
sufficiently
unreasonable,
it
is
a
due
process
violation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
many
of
these
cases...
in
this
court
only
from
state
courts,
but
the
federal
court
sits
as
a
state
court
in
diversity.
it
applies
as
state
law
non-statute,
and
the
same
constitutional
due
process
provisions
apply
to
the
federal
court
when
it
sits
as
a
state
court
in
diversity.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
have
read--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--simply
because
i
don't
think
a
diversity
case
has
reached
this
court
that
presents
this
problem,
but
i
believe
it
is
unanimously
accepted
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
federal
court
sits
as
a
state
tribunal
applying
the
state
long
arm
statute.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
oh,
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
absolutely.
when
congress
acts...
enacts
a
special
jurisdictional
statute
that
expands
service
in
a
securities
case
or
an
antitrust
case,
that
is
a
different
matter.
in
this
case
the
district
court
sitting
in
diversity
just
applies
the
state
long
arm
statute.
there
is
no
other
provision
conferring
more
expansive
jurisdiction
coming
from
congress.
that
is
the
essence
of
the
holdings
that
i
referred
your
honor
to.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
a
possibility,
of
course,
that
congress
may--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--i
believe
it
is
a
constitutional
point.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
refer
to
the
factors
that
this
court
has
said
are
dispositive
in
deciding
whether
personal
jurisdiction
is
appropriate
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
it
could,
and
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
that
that
is
a
state
that
has
a
paramount
interest
in
the
litigation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it
would
stop
the
tail
from
wagging
the
dog.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
make
no
such
contention.
if
a
constitutionally
reasonable
forum
is
selected,
then
we
have
no
trouble
with
the
single
publication
rule,
and
damages
can
be
awarded
for
the
entire
nation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
factors
that
this
court
has
mentioned
in
its
recent
decisions
are
the
forum's
interest
in
deciding
the
dispute,
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
the
plaintiff's
interest
in
convenient
relief,
the
judicial
system's
interest
in
efficient
disposition
of
suits,
and
the
shared
interests
of
all
of
the
states
in
efficient
application
of
their
own
substantive
policies.
and
we
submit
that
each
of
these
factors
weighs
very
heavily
against
the
choice
of
forum
in
this
particular
case.
the
burden
here
on
the
defendants
is
a
very
substantial
one.
the
defendants
were
all
domiciled
and
had
their
place
of
business
in
ohio.
the
individual
defendant
is
a
paraplegic,
residing
in
the
state
of
california,
and
as
the
uncontradicted
affidavits
show,
all
of
the
evidence
for
the
defense
must
come
from
new
york,
california,
and
ohio.
none
of
it
comes
from
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
and
these
persons
aren't
even
within
the
subpoena
power
of
the
new
hampshire
court.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
this
is
a
factor
to
be
weighed.
justice
brennan
has
made
the
point
in
a
number
of
his
opinions
that
litigation
involves
real
people
with
differences,
and
this
man
is
confined
to
a
wheelchair,
and
is
under
continuous
medical
care,
which
makes
traveling
across
the
country
for
an
extended
trial
in
another
jurisdiction
a
very
significant
burden.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
i
do
indeed.
an
extended
trial
in
an
$80
million
cause
of
action
is
a
very
substantial
and
grueling
ordeal.
the
plaintiff
is,
of
course,
entitled
to
seek
convenient
relief.
the
trouble
here
is
that
she
is
seeking
inconvenient
relief
from
the
point
of
view
of
everybody
concerned.
it
is
inconvenient
from
her
point
of
view.
this
isn't
her
home.
it
is
inconvenient
from
the
point
of
view
of
each
of
the
defendants.
it
is
inconvenient
from
the
point
of
view
of
each
of
the
witnesses.
and
it
is
grossly
inconvenient
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
local
court
and
the
local
jury
that
would
be
required
to
devote
their
own
scarce
time
to
resolve
this
stale
controversy,
in
which
neither
they
nor
their
neighbors
have
any
palpable
interest.
and
in
our
view,
the
state
of
new
hampshire's
interest
in
this
litigation--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
think
not,
your
honor.
as
this
court--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
states
are
not
keepers
of
the
residents
of
other
states,
as
this
court
held
in
mite
against
edgar.
the
state's
interest
is
in
protecting
its
own
residents,
and
this
is
the--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
indeed,
we
don't
think
that
they
have.
if
the
court
looks
at
the
opinions
that
mr.
grutman
has
cited,
the
leeper
case
and
the
roy
case,
you
will
see
that
the
new
hampshire
court
applies
the
very
same
analysis
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
there
has
to
be
a
palpable
state
interest,
and
there
is
a
prohibition
against
forum
shopping
under
this
very
statute.
they
apply
the
same
constitutional
principles
that
we
are
relying
on
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
what
they
said
is
that
new
hampshire
applies
the
same
due
process
test
that
this
court
has
to
apply.
they
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other
whether
the
state
would
fit
this
within
the
literal
language
of
the
provision,
although
i...
correct
that.
they
did
say
that
there
is
some
doing
business
here,
but
under
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
new
hampshire
you
have
to
weigh
the
palpability
of
the
local
state
interest
and
you
have
to
determine
whether
there
is
forum
shopping
going
on.
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
would
do
with
this
case
precisely
what
the
district
court
did.
that
is,
to
dismiss
it.
plaintiff
doesn't
get
much
argument...
support
for
the
argument
that
she
is
presenting
here
with
the
theory
that
the
tort
took
place
in
new
hampshire.
this
is,
of
course,
the
keystone
of
her
submission.
this
argument
is
too
abstract
to
be
helpful
in
a
case
that
involves
a
defamation
in
50
different
states.
if
the
tort
took
place
in
new
hampshire,
it
also
took
place
in
alaska,
and
in
hawaii,
and
in
every
other
state.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
this
defective
product
exploded,
if
you
will,
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
didn't
explode
in
50
different
states.
that,
we
submit,
is
just
a
jurisdictional
fiction.
practical
questions
of
federalism
don't
just
disappear
by
saying
the
tort
took
place
everywhere
and
therefore
the
plaintiff
can
forum
shop
throughout
the
whole
country
and
pick
the
most
inconvenient
place
in
the
whole
nation,
which
is
a
burden
on
the
court
and
the
witnesses
and
which
runs
roughshod
over
the
policies
of
the
other
50
states.
it
is
simply
too
facile
to
say
that
this
tort
took
place
everywhere
without
regard
to
which
states
really
had
the
paramount
interest
in
the
controversy,
which
is
new
york
and
ohio
and
not
new
hampshire,
and
not
alaska,
and
not
hawaii.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
say
that
in
a
multistate
defamation
case
where
there
is
an
argument
that
a
little
bit
of
injury
occurred
throughout
the
whole
country,
you
have
to
look
beyond
that
analysis.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
because
my--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--the
proof
before
the
district
court
was
that
99
percent
of
these
magazines
were
circulated
in
other
states,
and
that
the
plaintiff
had
never
been
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
was
not
known
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
she
worked
and
lived
in
new
york,
and
that
is
where
the
brunt
of
this
tort
fell.
we
are
not
saying,
of
course,
that
the
due
process
clause
imposes
technical
or
restrictive
requirements
on
plaintiff.
there
is
no
argument
here
that
the
plaintiff
didn't
know
that
she
had
been
libeled
in
1975--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--it
may
be
a
bit
broader
than
that.
it's
plaintiff's
residence,
defendant's
residence,
defendant's
principal
place
of
business--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
in
each
of
these
states
you
could
have
a
proceeding
to
collect
damages
everywhere.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
are
quite
content
with
the
single
publication
rule.
it
is
just,
it
has
to
be
applied
in
a
constitutionally
reasonable
forum,
not
a
forum
pulled
out
of
a
hat
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
longest
statute
of
limitations
in
the
entire
nation.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
plaintiff,
under
the
single
publication
rule,
has
to
prove
all
of
her
damages
in
whatever
state
she
picks.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
we
say
that
that--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--all
50
states.
that's
the
rule.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
yes,
and
that
is
why
it
is
so
important--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
she
picks
a
constitutionally
reasonable
forum,
she
can
then
collect
damages
for
the
entire
country.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
you
are
right,
mr.
justice.
i
am
against
forum
shopping.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
we
read
this
court's
decisions
to
prohibit
forum
shopping
when
there
is
not
a
reasonable
selection
of
forum
in
light
of
the
burdens
to
the
parties
and
the
interests
of
the
50
states.
