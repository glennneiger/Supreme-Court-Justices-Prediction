unknown
speaker
that
was
the
court's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
surprised,
mr.
grutman.
you
do
not
make
much
of
the
boxite
case
which
came
after
international
shoe.
you
cited
in
your
reply
brief
but
not
in--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
certainly
bears
on
world-wide
volkswagen.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
a
nationwide
publisher
creates
a
forum,
presumably,
in
almost
any
state,
and
i
suppose
it
has
always
been
libel
plaintiff's
position
that
they
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
shop.
unknown
speaker
they
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
shop
in
that
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
understand
respondent's
contention
in
that
regard
to
mean
something
more
than
just
the
state
of
new
hampshire
was
willing
to
accept
this
case
in
a
state
court?
i
suppose
it
must,
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
would
have
accepted
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
it
must
have
a
constitutional
dimension,
the
term
states--
unknown
speaker
--i
meant
that
i
thought
the
respondent's
contention
that
there
must
be
a
state
interest
had
a
constitutional
dimension
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
i
don't
ask
you
to;
but
is
that
your
understanding
of
respondent's
contention?
when
they
talk
about
a
state's
interest,
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
what
new
hampshire
wanted
in
this
situation,
but
that
there
are
some
limits
on
what
new
hampshire
can
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
grutman,
does
that
include
any
actual
harm
to
the
plaintiff?
is
that
alleged
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
that
harm
being?
unknown
speaker
it
is
alleged
that
this
particular
issue
which
involved
the
petitioner--
unknown
speaker
--was
circulated?
unknown
speaker
would
this
apply
in
alaska,
too?
unknown
speaker
would
it
apply
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
just
to
clarify
the
point,
that
would
be
even
if
the
plaintiff
was
totally
unknown
in
the
jurisdiction
before
the
magazine
was
circulated?
i
think
that
is
correct,
mr.
stevens,
so
long
as
alaska
or
hawaii
adheres,
i
believe,
to
the
uniform
and
universal
determination
that
the
tort
of
libel
is
perpetrated
wherever
a
defamatory
falsehood
is
circulated.
wherever
a
third
person
reads
about
it,
there
is
that
harm.
what
if
the
publisher
had
no
intention
of
ever
selling
any
magazines
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
is
different,
but
how...
what
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--would
the
result
be
different?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
your
position
that
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
new
hampshire
state
courts,
is
it
your
position
that
the
new
hampshire
courts
would
have
been
required
by
the
federal
constitution
to
entertain
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
they
would
not
be
entitled
just
to
dismiss
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you...
i
suppose
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
held...
held
that
the
federal
constitution
prohibited
new
hampshire
from
entertaining--
unknown
speaker
--well,
suppose
a
state
court
could
have
dismissed
it
without
having
any
problems
under
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
could
a
federal
court
sitting
in
that
district
also
dismiss
it
for
the
same
reason
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--why
not?
why
not?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
say
it's
a
constitutional
problem.
otherwise,
the
state
would
have
to
entertain
it.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
claiming,
though,
that
the
district
court
was
required
to
entertain
it
by
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
unknown
speaker
all
you
have
to
prove,
really,
is
that
new
hampshire
would
have
entertained
it,
could
have
under
the
constitution,
and
this
was
a
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
have
to...
you
do
have
to,
though,
say
that...
you
do
have
to
say
that
the
constitution
would
not
have
forbidden
new
hampshire
to
entertain--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
you
have
to
say
that...
you
have
to
say
that
the
constitutional
holding
of
the
court
below
was
wrong.
you
do
have
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
below
held
that
the
constitution
forbad.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
overturn
that.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
win
on
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
grutman,
i
understood
in
part
of
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
that
you
think
our
cases
support
the
proposition
that
a
federal
court
in
a
situation
like
that
may
have
an
obligation
to
take
jurisdiction
even
where
the
state
court
doesn't.
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
why
that
would
be
in
a
diversity
case.
unknown
speaker
but
diversity
is
not
a
constitutional
principle.
unknown
speaker
is
it?
unknown
speaker
diversity
is
judicial--
unknown
speaker
--and
not
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
that
put
a
constitutional
burden
on
somebody?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only
diversity
here
is
that
this
person
has
never
been
in
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
any
case
but
this
one.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
she
could
file
case
in
new
hampshire
if
she
were
a
citizen.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
except
that
she
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
so
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
diversity
automatically
discriminate?
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
more
question.
unknown
speaker
could
she
have
filed
50
lawsuits?
unknown
speaker
and
her
damages
would
be
the
damages
to
her
reputation
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
including
alaska
and
hawaii?
unknown
speaker
guam?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
go
to
guam
while
you're
at
it?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
new
hampshire
couldn't
give
remedy
for
any
injury
except
that
which
occurred
in
ne
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
you
just
said--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
new
hampshire
suit,
you
could
recover.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
while
you
say
that,
you
are
in
effect
making
an
end
run
around
the
statute
of
limitations
in
all
other
jurisdictions.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
i
am
asking,
but
is
that
one
extinguished,
the
one
that
has
expired?
is
that
one
extinguished
even
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position,
and
of
course
i
suppose
one
could
take
the
other
position.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question?
unknown
speaker
the...
in
the
red
brief,
they
take
the
position
that
the
issue
is
different
as
to
the
corporate
publisher
and
the
individual
defendant
and
the
parent.
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
is
this
case.
it
is
this
case.
jurisdiction
over
larry
flynt
in--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
in
the
trial
court,
was
not
jurisdiction
overall
all
three
parties
challenged?
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
court.
didn't
they
challenge
jurisdiction
over
all
three?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
had
an
opportunity
to
make
whatever
record
you
need
to
as
to
the
other
two--
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
other
states,
the
other
states
have
a
paramount
interest
in
the
parties?
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
negate
what
you
started
out
with.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
would
not
the
ne
hampshire
court
have
the
authority
if
it
found
jurisdiction
to
apply
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
other
states
with
respect
to
the
recovery?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
if
your
concern
is
with
what
you
feel
to
be
manipulation
of
statutes
of
limitations,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
argument.
that
is
perhaps
an
argument
over
choice
of
law,
maybe
constitutionally
mandated
choice
of
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
this
argument
doesn't
dispose
of
the
case,
because
you
still
have
got
new
hampshire
left.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
your
argument
would
say
new
hampshire
couldn't
give
a
remedy
for
injuries
that
have
already
barred
somewhere
else,
but
how
about
the
injury
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
you
still
have
to
make
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
your
argument
would
only
say...
would
only
refer
to
the
injuries
outside
of
new
hampshire,
the
argument
that
you
have
made
so
far.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
that
she
will
not
be
able
to
prove
damages
in
new
hampshire?
you
seem
to
take
that
as
an
assumption,
that
she
can't.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
suppose
there
was
proof
of
it.
your
argument
would
not
forbid
new
hampshire
to
give
a
remedy
for
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
holding
that
you
are
seemingly
defending
is
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
prevented
the
district
court
from
entertaining
this
suit
even
if,
as
i
understand
it,
there
was
damage
in
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
answered
that
one
yet.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
different,
but
what
would
the
result
be
jurisdictionally?
unknown
speaker
well,
which
side
are
you
going
to
fall
off
of?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
aren't
there
allegations
here
of
injury
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
he
might
prove
it
whenever
he
had
a
chance
to
prove
it.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
there
has
been
no
ruling
on
it.
that
is
a...
they
dismissed
the
case,
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
everything
has
to
be
resolved
against
affidavits
at
this
point,
because
they
have
never
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
their
proof.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
she
can
prove
it
if
she
has
her
day
in
court,
and
if
that
happens,
the
federal
court
might
decide,
agreeing
with
you,
that
the
damages
could
be
only
the
damages
suffered
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
the
judgment
you
are
defending,
the
judgment
you
are
defending
here
is
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
because
of
the
federal
constitution
to
hear
even
a
case
about
damages
in
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
don't
agree
with
you.
what
if
we
don't
agree
with
you?
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
the
district
court's
constitutional
holding
that
there
could
not
be
a
suit
in
new
hampshire
for
new
hampshire
damages?
unknown
speaker
say
it
focused
on
both,
clearly
both.
say
any
fool
reading
it
would
know
it
focused
on
both.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
dismissing
the
whole
suit.
you
say
that
they
are
seeking
nationwide
damages,
and
perhaps
they
might
recover
new
hampshire
damages
only,
but
certainly
new
hampshire
is
one
of
the
50
states,
and
it
is
part
of
the
nation,
and
so
that
when
they
seek
nationwide
damages,
it
probably
includes
some
small
segment
that
happened
in
new
hampshire.
unknown
speaker
it
would
also
require
reversing
the
district
court's
jurisdictional
holding,
and
which
i
take
it
you
would
think
we
should
do,
if
it
were
just
strictly
a
new
hampshire
suit.
unknown
speaker
you
are
still
on
the
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
say
the
parties
have
a
very
indirect
and
tenuous
connection
with
this
forum.
let's
take
the
defendant.
the
defendant,
as
i
understand
it,
sent
to
new
hampshire
six,
eight,
10,000
copies
of
the
magazine
each
month.
how
can
you
call
that
an
indirect
and
tenuous
connection?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that--
unknown
speaker
--don't
you
think
the
corporate
defendant
intended
that
to
happen?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
either...
why
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
if
the
corporate
defendant
chooses
to
publish
hundreds
of
thousands
of
copies
of
a
magazine
and
libel
somebody
in
it,
it
is
present
everywhere.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
won't
be
able
to
make
the
proof
for
the
other
49
states,
and
how
does
this
court
concern
itself
with
that
problem
at
this
stage,
before
there
has
been
any
evidence
and
before
there
has
been
any
trial?
unknown
speaker
people
don't
always
get
everything
that
they
ask
for
in
a
complaint,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
i
am
afraid
we
are
no
giving
you
much
chance
to
argue
your
case,
but
you
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
has
little
or
no
interest
because
she
may
not
have
been
known
in
new
hampshire
but
let's
assume
that
she
was
not
known
at
all
therefore
had
no
favorable
reputation
there.
is
it
no
possible
that
after
these
publications,
she
had
a
ba
reputation
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
state
have
an
interest
in
protecting
the
name
of
a
person
who
receives
the
sort
of
publicity
this
individual
has
received
in
new
hampshire,
even
though
she
was
totally
unknown
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
shapiro,
wouldn't
you--
unknown
speaker
--wouldn't
you
normally
take
care
of
that
under
the
forum
non-convenience
doctrine,
assuming
that
it
were
in
a
federal
court
and
several
jurisdictions
were
available?
it
just
simply
isn't
an
option
here
because
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
how
you
would
normally
take
care
of
those
concerns?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
you
used
the
term
forum
shopping
several
times,
and
you
speak
of
it
rather
opprobriously,
as
perhaps
you
have
a
right
to,
but
there
is
no
general
constitutional
provision
against
forum
shopping,
if
you
mean
by
that
that
the
plaintiff
chooses
the
forum
in
which
it
can
get
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
in
the
most
favorable
terms
to
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
point?
supposing
this
suit
had
been
brought
promptly
after...
within
six
months
of
the
libel,
so
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
run
in
other
states.
would
you
still
argue
that
new
hampshire
had
no
constitutional
power
to
entertain
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
then
arguing
that
the
only
constitutionally
permissible
forum
was
ohio
or
new
york?
unknown
speaker
would
you
make
the
same
argument
even
if
most
of
the
magazines
were
circulated
in
some
third
state,
say,
california
or
illinois?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
would
you
help
me
on
one
respect?
you
referred
a
while
ago
to
new
hampshire's
statute
of
limitations
situation
as
a
procedural
matter.
unknown
speaker
there
was
an
action
in
ohio
in
this
litigation,
and
dismissed
because
the
ohio
court
applied
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations.
is
that
procedural
in
ohio
or
substantive?
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
substantive,
could
you
argue
that
the
case
is
res
judicata?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
missed
it,
but
do
you
agree
that
it
could
have
been
filed
only
for
the
damages
in
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
my
problem
is,
how
can
we
rule
on
all
the
multiple
states
if
they
would
have
jurisdiction
there?
the
only
thing
the
multiple
states
would
do
would
go
to
the
damages.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
forum
non-convenience
a
constitutional
point?
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
be?
unknown
speaker
which
section
of
the
constitution
does
it--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
civil
case?
unknown
speaker
but
haven't
all
of
our
minimum
contacts
cases
come
up
out
of
state
courts,
or
have
some
of
them
come
from
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
are
you
as
confident
of
your
answer
as
you
sound?
unknown
speaker
but
no
case
from
this
court
supports
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
in
some...
if
you
are
out
of
the
diversity
field
of...
you
may
have
nationwide
service
of
process
in
some
cases--
unknown
speaker
--that
may
make
it
much
easier
to
try
a
case
in
federal
court
than
in
the
corresponding
state
court.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
if
we
spend
all
our
time
and
decide
this
case
on
diversity,
and
then
next
year
congress
gives
up
diversity?
unknown
speaker
it
sort
of
shows
that
it
really
is
a
constitutional
point.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
before
you
do,
i
may
have...
perhaps
i
missed
it,
but
if
the
suit
hadn't
been
barred
in
ohio
and
had
gone
forward,
but
it
was
barred
everywhere
else--
unknown
speaker
--have
you
said,
could
the
recovery
be
nationwide
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
say
then--
unknown
speaker
--you
wouldn't
say
then
that
there
was
some
effort
to
run
around
the
statute
of
limitations
of
all
the
other
states?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
difficulty
of
traveling
to
new
hampshire
for
the
trial
of
the
case
because
of
some
disability?
unknown
speaker
you
distinguish
the
travel
across
the
country
for
a
trial
from
the
travel
to
washington
for
a
similar
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
inquire
there.
just
a
minute,
mr.
shapiro.
you
say,
in
which
they
have
no
interest.
doesn't
everyone
of
the
200
and
some
million
people
in
this
country
have
an
interest
when
someone
else
is
damaged
and
injured,
if
they
can
show
that
they
have
been?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
all
the
rest
of
the
people
are
totally
indifferent?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
under
that
argument,
they
should
not
have
extended
their
long
arm...
the
benefits
of
the
long
arm
statute
to
non-residents.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
were
against
you
on
that
point
of
new
hampshire
law.
they
said
new
hampshire
would
have
entertained
this
suit.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
put
together
a
defective
locomotive
and
run
it
through
50
states
and
it
does
harm
in
each
of
the
50
states,
a
tort
has
occurred
in
all
50
states.
if
someone
publishes
a
libel
and
circulates
it
in
50
states,
presumably
harm
has
occurred
in
all
50
states.
that
is
the
choice
of
the
publisher.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
jurisdiction
should
not
follow
injury.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
get
the
statement...
what
is
the
support
for
your
statement
that
a
little
injury
occurred
all
over
the
country?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
the
allegation
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
the
multiple
complaint
can
be
filed
in
only
two
states,
where
the
defendant
is
or
where
the
plaintiff
is.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
don't
have
a
multiple
state
action,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
the
whole...
you
want
the
whole
system
thrown
out,
of
multiple
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
prove
damages
in
any
state?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
in
any.
in
all
50
states--
unknown
speaker
--she
can
prove
damages.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
that
require
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
against
forum
shopping.
unknown
speaker
it
is
awful
late.
it
is
awful
late
in
the
game.
