mr.
norman
roy
grutman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
sovereign
state
of
new
hampshire's
long-arm
statute
is
to
be
denied
enforcement
under
the
due
process
clause
despite
the
conduct
of
hustler
in
circulating
its
magazines
in
new
hampshire
out
of
which
a
cause
of
action
for
libel
arose.
the
libel
in
question
was
part
of
a
series
of
unprovoked
calumnies
and
vilifications
heaped
upon
the
plaintiff
accusing
her
of
among
other
things
licentious
promiscuity
and
having
a
venereal
disease
which
in
any
jurisdiction
would
be
tantamount
to
libel
per
se.
the
law
suit
was
initially
instituted
in
the
state
court
of
ohio
in
1977
where
there
appeared
to
be
no
question
about
obtaining
personal
jurisdiction
over
both
mr.
flynt
personally
and
his
magazine.
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation
ohio
specifically
applied
its
own
statute
of
limitations
to
dismiss
the
libel
claim
while
upholding
the
viability
of
plaintiff's
claim
for
invasion
of
privacy.
relying
upon
that
determination
for
several
years
thereafter
plaintiff
continued
to
vigorously
prosecute
her
case
in
ohio
until
on
the
night
before
trial
was
to
commence
the
ohio
trial
court
reversed
itself
and
applied
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations
reparable
to
the
cause
of
action
for
invasion
of
privacy
and
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
case
entirely
out
of
court.
after
the
plaintiff's
appeal
was
affirmed
by
the
ohio
appellate
court
plaintiff
promptly
brought
a
diversity
law
suit
in
new
hampshire
serving
the
defendants
under
the
new
hampshire
long-arm
statute
which
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
interpreted
as
being
intended
to
be
extended
as
far
as
the
constitution
will
permit
under
the
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
found
that
while
the
new
hampshire
long-arm
statute
was
satisfied
due
process
forbad
entertaining
the
action
and
it
dismissed
it
giving
two
reasons:
plaintiff's
lack
of
connections
or
contacts
with
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
the
alleged
lack
of
new
hampshire's
interest
in
the
litigation.
the
first
circuit
affirmed
without
disturbing
the
district
court's
evaluation
of
the
defendant's
presence
in
new
hampshire
as
regular,
systematic
and
continuous
because
of
the
monthly
circulation
of
hustler
seeking
to
exploit
the
new
hampshire
market
place
which
took
place
on
a
continuing
basis
since
1975.
the
reason
or
the
reasoning
of
the
first
circuit
in
affirming
is
epitomized
in
the
catchy
phrase
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion
in
which
it
said
the
new
hampshire
tail
is
too
small
to
wag
so
large
an
out
of
state
dog.
the
phrase
captures
what
we
submit
to
this
court
is
the
essential
misconception
of
the
lower
courts
in
assuming
that
jurisdiction
turns
on
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
of
plaintiff's
contacts
and
damage
in
the
forum
overlooking
that
for
38
years
since
this
court's
opinion
in
international
shoe
the
jurisdictional
inquiry
has
always
focused
on
the
contacts
of
the
defendant,
not
the
plaintiff.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
insofar
as
the
assertion
that
jurisdiction
is
to
be
determined
there
are
essentially
three
levels
by
which
or
three
tiers
by
which
a
determination
can
be
made.
if
a
defendant
by
its
continuous,
systematic
process
can
be
said
to
be
doing
business
then
it
is
dogmatic
that
general
jurisdiction
exists
in
that
forum
for
litigation
against
that
defendant
for
all
kinds
of
causes
of
action.
we
do
not
argue
in
this
case
that
we
fall
within
that
rubric.
we
submit
that
synthesizing
all
of
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
spoken
from
international
shoe
through
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
world-wide
volkswagen.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
the
court's
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
white.
forgive
me.
the
synthesis
of
those
cases
holds
that
where
you
have
purposeful
conduct
by
a
defendant
directed
at
the
forum
in
question
and
out
of
which
conduct
the
cause
of
action
arises
or
is
generated
that
satisfies
the
formula
of
those
minimum
contacts
which
substantial
justice
and
reasonable
fair
play
make
it
suitable
that
a
defendant
should
be
hailed
into
that
court
and
be
amenable
to
suit
in
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
the
boxite
case
as
i
interpret
it
has
to
do
with
the
failure
of
the
defendant
who
by
its
waiver
to
its
failure
to
comply
with
orders
of
the
court
to
demonstrate
its
nonamenability
to
suit
was
found
by
the
court
in
that
case
to
have
subjected
itself
to
a
determination
that
facts
could
be
found
against
it
so
that
jurisdiction
could
be
properly
assessed
against
that
defendant.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
it
does,
but
i
think
that
volkswagen
in
its
facts
and
in
the
more
expansive
treatment
in
the
court's
opinion
is
a
case
which
i
think
provides
the
springboard
from
which
the
court
can
find
in
this
lawsuit
that
what
you
have
present
in
this
case
and
what
was
lacking
in
volkswagen.
in
volkswagen
you
had
purely
adventitious
or
fortuitous
circumstances
by
which
jurisdiction
was
asserted
against
a
little
automobile
dealer
in
mesena,
new
york
whose
only
business
was
in
mesena,
new
york
and
who
had
no
connection
with
the
state
of
oklahoma.
similarly
the
tri-state
regional
dealer
albeit
under
the
name
world-wide
volkswagen
it
unlike
hustler
in
this
case
in
no
way
for
its
economic
advantage
did
business
in
oklahoma
or
sold
its
products
in
oklahoma.
as
i
read
what
the
court
was
saying
and
what
your
opinion
i
think
pointed
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
that
you
were
looking
for
in
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
willful,
purposeful
economic
activity.
now
that
is
clearly
present
in
this
case
as
it
relates
to
hustler
because
huslter
in
the
court's
opinion
directly
or
indirectly
was
responsible
on
a
systematic
basis
from
1975
for
sending
copies
of
its
magazines
into
new
hampshire
out
of
which
the
record
shows
they
derived
substantial
economic
benefit
running
into
millions
of
dollars.
that
was
not
one
insurance
policy
which
this
court
found
sufficient
in
mcgee
v.
international
insurance.
that
was
a
1957
case
and
again
tracing
the
sweep
of
this
court's
opinions
on
jurisdiction
starting
with
the
germinal
case
of
international
shoe
and
running
through
world-wide
volkswagen
into
the
boxite
case
i
think
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
we
are
seeing
an
expansion
of
jurisdiction
since
the
second
world
war
in
recognition
of
the
changing
facts
of
life
in
american
society.
i
say
that
on
the
second
level
of
analysis
which
our
reply
brief
attempted
to
explicate
for
the
court
we
believe
that
we
are
squarely
within
the
philosophical
underpinnings
by
which
this
court
has
formulated
those
circumstances
in
which
jurisdiction
can
properly
be
laid,
and
again
i
say
the
focus
must
be
on
the
conduct
of
the
defendant.
respondent's
briefs
tend
to
castigate
us
by
opprobrious
references
to
so-called
forum
shopping,
which,
while
it
is
sort
of
a
pungent
phrase,
seems
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is
not
the
plaintiff
that
creates
the
forum,
it
is
the
defendant,
by
his
conduct
in
the
forum.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
they
are
what?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
libel
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
a
tort,
and
when
we
are
dealing
with
media
defendants
that
are
nationwide
in
the
scope
of
the
economic
activities
that
they
pursue,
seeking
the
benefits
of
the
marketplace
nationwide,
they
have
the
unique
ability
of
simultaneously
creating
the
harm
which
the
libel
causes
in
all
of
the
places
where
the
publication
is
disseminated.
now,
the
publications
have
the
benefit
of
the
single
publication
rule.
that
is
a
rule
which
i
think
is
uniformly
recognized
throughout
the
country
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
required
to
prove
all
of
her
damage
or
all
of
his
damage
in
whichever
forum
the
case
is
properly
brought,
but
if
one
were
to
look
at
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
publisher,
what
should
the
publisher
do
in
the
event
of
concern
with
statutes
of
limitations
or
the
special
niche
which
this
court
has
carved
out
for
media
defendants
in
libel
cases?
this
court
in
its
decisions
beginning
with
sullivan
and
working
through
gertz
against
welsh
in
the
evolution
of
the
public
figure
doctrine,
has
established
that
the
states,
so
long
as
they
do
not
create
liability
without
fault,
may
establish
standards
which
are
different.
state
a
may
say
that
it
is
gross
negligence.
state
b
may
say
that
it
is
simple
negligence.
state
c
may
say
it
is
the
malice
standard.
now,
assuming
that
we
have
a
publication,
of
whatever
nature,
whether
it
is
acceptable
or
presumably
reputable,
if
a
harm
occurs
nationwide,
then
conscientious
and
responsible
lawyering
would
require
that
a
plaintiff
take
cognizance
of
where
it
would
be
most
propitious
to
bring
the
lawsuit,
and
in
that,
i
think
there
is
neither
shame
nor
disgrace.
i
think
that
it
is
an
incident
of
our
federal
system
under
the
peculiarity
which
adheres
in
defamation
law.
the
submission,
may
it
please
the
court,
which
we
make,
is
that
we
are
squarely
within
all
of
your
prior
holdings.
we
are
the
case
which
international
volkswagen
contemplated
with
the
telling
difference
to
which
i
have
alluded
and
the
argument
that
i
have
just
made.
the
contention
is,
however,
made
by
respondents
that
there
must
be,
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
be
appropriate
against
an
out
of
state
resident
in
an
action
such
as
this,
a
so-called
state's
interest.
well--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--precisely.
i
do.
and--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
dimension,
and
it
could
primarily
be
derived
from
the
fact
that
an
indispensable
ingredient
of
state
sovereignty
is
the
right
of
any
state
to
regulate
intentional
harm
which
takes
place
within
the
perimeter
of
its
geographical
confines,
particularly
where
that
harm
is
not
unintentional.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
beyond
what
i
have
said,
i
am
not
prepared
to
concede
that.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
am
not
really
sure
that
i
can
agree
with
that,
because
i
think
that
takes
us
into
a
very
murky
area,
where
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
predict
or
to
understand
what
kind
of
state
interest
they
want.
perhaps,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
another
kind
of
a
case,
in
a
case
in
which
you
have
something
less
than
purposeful
conduct
out
of
which
the
cause
of
action
arose,
and
you
were
looking
to
ascertain
whether
jurisdiction
could
be
affirmed,
you
would
have
to
find
affiliating
circumstances
with
the
defendant
plus
a
so-called
state
interest.
now,
that
kind
of
a
state
interest,
if
you
look
for
it
in
this
case,
and
it
is
to
that
to
which
i
address
my
attention,
is
demonstrated,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief,
by
the
fact
that
new
hampshire
in
1971
amended
its
long
arm
statute
so
as
to
permit
the
use
of
that
statute
for
non-residents.
it
has
interpreted
its
long
arm
statute
to
permit
the
furthest
reach
permissible
under
due
process.
in
leaper
versus
leaper,
which
was
treated
by
the
first
circuit,
new
hampshire
said
it
had
an
interest
in
protecting
not
only
its
residents
but
non-residents
against
just
such
kinds
of
harm
as
are
involved
in
a
case
like
this
in
libel,
and
lastly,
new
hampshire,
expressing
as
another
part
of
the
cluster
of
its
evidences
of
its
interest
in
this
case,
has
a
criminal
statute
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
if
anyone
intentionally
by
falsehood
holds
someone
up
to
the
kind
of
ridicule,
calumny,
and
obloquy
which
mr.
flynt
did
in
this
case.
so,
if
you
ask
me
in
this
case,
because
i
am
not
really
entirely
sure
whether
the
respondents
are
advocating
that
there
should
be
a
general
grab-bag
of
so-called
state
interests
which
are
highly
amorphous
that
should
be
considered
at
every
stage
in
all
cases
in
the
equation
of
ascertaining
if
jurisdiction
exists
or
not,
that
is
so
far
cut
of
the
question,
i
would
prefer
for
the
purposes
of
the
adjudication
of
this
case
to
confine
myself
simply
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
to
point
out
that
if
you
are
looking
for
state
interest,
it
is
abundantly
present
in
all
of
the
indicia
to
which
i
have
just
alluded.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes.
it
is...
not
only
is
it
alleged,
it
is
conceded
by
the
first
circuit
that
harm
occurred
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
the
harm
occurs
in
the
defamation
itself,
the
negative
reputation
if
she
doesn't
have
a
positive
reputation.
it
is
the
libel,
the
accusation,
the
psychic
mayhem,
which
is
what
professor
tribe
calls
it,
of
simply
disseminating
something
which
is
itself
a
libel.
there
is
no
requirement
when
you
speak
of
harm,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
demonstrate
that
she
suffered
her
principal
injury
or
loss
in
that
particular
state,
so
long
as
some
harm
occurred
there,
and
the
harm
by
definition
under
the
restatement
and
under
the
law
of
new
hampshire
would
be
the
circulation,
not
necessarily
where
it
was
published,
but
the
circulation
of
something
which
is
libelous.
as
i
think...
forgive
me.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
oh,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
there
were
a
minimum
of
10,000
copies
that
month
and
every
month,
and
there
are
five
issues
which
we
are
concerned
with.
you
see,
this
is
not
an
isolated
case.
it
is
a
total
campaign
where
this
media
mogul
has
simply
fastened
on
ms.
keeton
as
an
object
of
his
ire,
and
can
decide
that
he
can
make
money
all
over
the
country,
but
he
just
doesn't
want
to
be
sued
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
it
would
apply,
mr.
justice
marshall,
wherever
the
magazine
was
circulated.
it
would
apply
in
honolulu
if
the
publication
were
circulated
there.
it
would
apply
theoretically
and,
i
think,
correctly
wherever
the
magazine
was
circulated,
however
many
copies
were
circulated.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
a
very
different
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
that
is
a
case--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--it
might
he
different.
it
might
be
different,
because
in
that
case
you
could
not
say,
as
you
do
here,
that
you
have
purposeful
conduct.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
there
you
have
to
look
for
other...
i
think
your
phrase
is
affiliating
circumstances,
other
connections,
judicially
cognizable
ties--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
don't
think
that
is
a
question
that
is
inherent
in
the
case,
but
i
think
that
they
should
have,
yes.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
because
that
is
a
state
court,
and
your
question
postulated
a
state
court.
i
believe
that
because
we
brought
it
in
federal
court,
and
because
of
the
federal
court's
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
to
its
maximum,
a
federal
court
could
not--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--yes,
the
federal
court
would
be
prohibited.
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
what
the
answer
would
be
in
a
state
court.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
do
not
think
so,
because
the
requirements--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--because
the
requirement--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
this
question.
i
have
pondered
the
question.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
what
a
state
and
a
federal
court
could
do.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
i
am.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
perhaps
i
don't
have
to,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
exactly.
and
because
of
new
hampshire's
statement
about
its
intention
of
what
should
be
done,
namely,
that
new
hampshire
would
have
taken
this
case,
the
district
court
said
that
the
new
hampshire
court
would
have
taken
this
case
if
it
was
a
new
hampshire
resident.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
force
jurisdiction
on
a
state,
on
a
state
court,
and
as
again
i
pointed
out,
i
think
there
is
a
very
big
difference
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts
and
their
obligations.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
would
you
repeat
that
for
me,
please,
mr.
justice
white?
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
i
do.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
i
do,
and
the
reason
i
think
i
do
is
because
the
court's
perception
of
which
end
of
the
scope
to
look
through
was
just
backwards.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
because
i
think
the
obligation
which
the
federal
rules
require
is
that
a
federal
court
cannot
substitute
an
alternate
basis
of
its
own
determination
which
runs
contrary
to
what
the
state
has
said,
and
new
hampshire
has
said
it
would
take
this
case.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
beg--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--which
is
not
a--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
because
once
you
have
diversity,
and
you
have
a
demonstration--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--nor
had
mr.
flynt
been
there,
but
the
publication
was
there,
the
publication--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--all
right.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
is
what
the
district
court
said.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no.
do
i
believe
that
she
should
have
been
able
to?
yes,
except
the
only
disagreement--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--my
disagreement
is--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there's
a
discrimination
that
is
being
practiced
upon
a
non-resident.
they
are
saying,
although
the
legislature--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--i
think
diversity
makes
for
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
it
is
the
sine
qua
non
for
diversity
jurisdiction.
but
in
a
state
court,
which
is
where
i
think
we
were
speaking
of,
if
this
case
had
been
brought
in
the
state
court,
the
district
court
said
that
new
hampshire
would
undoubtedly
have
entertained
the
case.
now,
because
ms.
keeton
was
not
a
new
hampshire
plaintiff,
a
discrimination
was
practiced
against
her
that
finds
no
support
in
the
new
hampshire
decision
or
in
the
new
hampshire
legislation
in
which
she
was
deprived
of
her
right
to
that
forum,
and
while
the
due
process
argument
is
raised
against
her,
i
think
that
is
an
argument
that
she
could
raise
on
her
own
behalf
along
with
equal
protection.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
she
could
not,
because
the
single
publication
rule
requires
that
the
plaintiff
make
an
election
of
that
jurisdiction
in
which
she
intends
to
make
a
claim
not
only
for
the
harm
that
occurred
in
the
jurisdiction
where
she
properly
brings
suit,
but
for
the
harm
that
has
occurred
wherever
the
libel
has
been
perpetrated.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
they
would
not.
the
damages
that
she
would
be
entitled
to
prove
in
new
hampshire
would
not
be
restricted
simply
to
those
that
were
sustained
in
new
hampshire,
but
would
embrace
all
of
the
damages
that
she
had
suffered
wherever
it
had
occurred.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
including
alaska,
hawaii,
kampchatga
and
tobago,
wherever.
i
think--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
anywhere,
your
honor.
worldwide.
wherever
they
occur,
she
has
to
bring
that
to
that
forum.
why
did
she
go
to
ne
hampshire
is
obvious,
because
it
was
the
only
remaining
jurisdiction
in
which
suit
could
have
been
brought.
it
was
the
only
statute
of
limitations
that
was
still
viable.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
disagree,
mr.
justice
white.
i
believe--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--the
damages
worldwide
become--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--in
the
new
hampshire
suit,
the
damages
sustained
wherever
they
occur
is
proof
that
is
to
be
brought
in
the
new
hampshire
action.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
may
be
a
by-product,
or
that
may
be
a
fact,
but
i
do
not
think
because
we
are
a
federal
system,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
do
not
think
that
because
we
are
a
federal
system,
where
the
statutes
of
limitations
in
the
50
states
may
vary,
that
as
soon
as
the
earliest
statute
expires,
that
all
of
the
others
simultaneously
are
extinguished.
insofar
as
new
hampshire
is--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--no,
it
was
not
extinguished
at
the
time.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
i
think
not.
it
is
unquestionable
that
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
the
legislature
of
new
hampshire
had
allowed,
i
believe,
a
six-year
period
in
which
libel
actions
could
be
brought
before
it,
and
we
were
within
the
new
hampshire
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
it
is
desirable--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--certainly.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
that
is
another
case
for
this
morning,
mr.
justice
stevens.
but
it
raises
a
point
which
i
think
bears
mention
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
exactly.
the
problem
there
was
that
because
the
district
court
decided
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
publication,
it
never
considered
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
corporation
or
mr.
flynt
personally,
and
we
were
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
establishing
the
record,
which
i
submit
responsively
we
could
demonstrate
that
we
will
be
able
to
do
if
on
remand
we
can
flesh
out
the
record
and
demonstrate
that--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--in
which--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--they
did,
but
the
district
court
never
considered--
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
--the
district
court
said,
inasmuch
as
they
are
making
a
determination
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
over
the
publication,
that
will
lump
together
flynt
and
the
corporation,
and
we
don't
thin
that
that
is
correct,
because
the
jurisdictional
equation
must
be
separately
applied
to
each
defendant
and
that
wasn't
done
in
the
district
court.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
no,
we
did
not
fully.
i
will
develop
that
in
my
rebuttal,
since
i
notice
that
my
time
has
presently
expired.
mr.
norman
roy
grutman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
to
a
question
which
you
put
to
my
colleague,
and
pointing
to
that
place
in
the
record,
which
is
to
be
found
at
15-a
of
the
appendix,
where
the
first
circuit
said.
"the
major
factor
favoring
plaintiff
is
that
she
is
suing
in
part
for
damages
suffered
in
new
hampshire.
"
which
is
an
acknowledgement
of
the
fact
that
she
did
suffer
injury
in
new
hampshire,
"and
although
the
defendant's
contacts
with
new
hampshire
are
sparse,
they
were
not
random,
isolated,
or
transitory.
"
"the
general
course
of
conduct
in
circulating
magazines
throughout
the
state
was
purposefully
directed
at
new
hampshire.
"
counsel
has
spoken
to
the
court
about
that
state
which
has
the
paramount
interest,
and
although
the
language
was
written
by
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
volkswagen,
i
do
not
think
he
was
expressing
anything
with
which
the
court
would
disagree
when
he
said
that,
"a
defendant
has
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
the
best
forum
or,
for
that
matter,
to
any
particular
forum.
"
"under
even
the
most
restrictive
view
of
international
shoe,
several
states
could
have
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
cause
of
action.
"
that
is
certainly
the
case
in
this
lawsuit.
i
promised
that
i
would
allude
to
something
mr.
justice
stevens
raised
at
the
conclusion
of
my
principal
remarks,
and
i
would
like
not
to
omit
what
i
was
saying
when
i
originally
concluded,
and
that
was
namely
that
the
district
court
focused
on
the
plaintiff's
lack
of
contacts,
and
therefore
they
never
reached
the
minimum
contacts
of
flynt
or
of
his
publication,
and
they
therefore
dismissed
a
fortiori
because
of
plaintiff's
lack
of
contacts,
and
i
submit
that
on
remand
we
would,
and
t
represent
this
responsibly,
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
flynt
had
those
contacts
himself,
as
did
the
corporation,
which
would
satisfy
the
international
shoe
formula
as
to
them.
the
references
made
by
counsel
to
the
restatement
were
to
the
restatement
of
conflict,
and
i
think
that
what
is
spoken
of
in
that
restatement
primarily
has
to
do
with
choice
of
law,
not
with
jurisdiction
or
definition
as
to
what
constitutes
a
tort.
there
was
a
considerable
reference
to
the
inconvenience
which,
madame
justice
o'connor,
i
think,
is
clearly
dealt
with
under
section
1404(a)
by
which,
after
jurisdiction
has
been
determined,
the
federal
court
has
the
flexibility
by
which
under
forum
non-convenience
to
designate
some
other
forum
in
which
the
case
could
be
tried,
but
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
that
under
the
van
dusen
case,
the
corpus
juris
that
would
be
applied
so
far
as
the
statute
of
limitations
is
concerned
is
the
corpus
juris
of
the
forum
in
which
the
action
was
brought,
namely,
new
hampshire.
essentially,
what
this
court
has
heard
this
morning
is
a
claim
which
the
respondents
argue
that
other
states'
statutes
of
limitations
prohibit
new
hampshire
from
exercising
a
jurisdiction
which
for
itself
it
has
determined
at
six
years.
i
would
conclude,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
this
court,
by
observing
that
that
is
an
incident
of
federalism.
it
is
a
reflection
of
our
diversity.
if
you
travel
around
this
country
and
look
at
the
airports
in
which
you
land,
we
are
so
homogeneous
it
is
almost
impossible
to
know
where
you
are,
but
i
think
that
it
is
worthwhile
that
this
court
should
preserve
the
diversity
which
in
no
inconsiderable
measure
has
been
part
of
the
richness
and
greatness
of
this
country.
thank
you.
