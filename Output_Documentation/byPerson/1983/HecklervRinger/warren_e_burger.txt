chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
heckler
against
ringer.
mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
got
a
favorable
result,
that
is,
that
it
would
be
covered,
could
the
government
compel
them
to
have
the
operation
thereafter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
couldn't
even
expressly
authorize
compulsive
operations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
harkins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
will
put
to
you
the
question
i
put
to
your
friend.
if
the
secretary
then
acts
in
advance,
gives
the
advisory
opinion,
can
the
government
in
any
way
compel
the
person
to
go
ahead
with
the
operation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
might
be
spending
a
lot
of
their
time
spinning
their
wheels,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
holding
that
they
are
entitled
to
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
recipient
or
the
claimant
is
going
to
go
ahead
with
the
surgery.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
medical
opinion
on
the
subject?
there
was
some
discussion
of
it
in
the
briefs.
what
is
the
medical
opinion
on
the
utility
or
necessity
of
this
particular
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you,
pursuing
some
of
the
earlier
questions.
there
has
been
a
statutory
or...
i
think
it's
a
statutory
allowance
that
people
get
a
tax
cut
if
they
insulate
their
homes.
there
is
legislation
being
discussed
about
giving
a
tax
credit
if
people
put
air
bags
in
their
cars
pending
the
time
when
it
would
be
compulsory,
if
ever.
suppose
someone
comes
into
the
irs
and
says,
i
am
old
and
i
am
poor,
and
i
want
to
put
an
airbag
in
my
car
but
i
can't
afford
to
do
it
unless
you
absolutely
assure
me
that
i
will
get
a
tax
credit
for
it.
do
you
think
they
could
insist
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
has
the
authority
to
construe
a
statute?
the
agency
entrusted
with
its
enforcement?
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
until
a
court
says
otherwise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
an
administrative
law
judge
can
ignore--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
at
1:00.
