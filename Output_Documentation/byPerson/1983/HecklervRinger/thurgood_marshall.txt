you
are
not
going

up
here,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
going
to
amend
in
this
court,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
it's
him,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
you
can
argue
that
what
you
are
arguing,
you
will
have
any
member
of
the
class
eligible
to
argue
the
point
that
you
are
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
what
right
do
you
make
that
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
the
treatment
before
the
regulation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
are
we
spinning
our
wheels
right
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
upset
a
clear
ruling
of
the
court
just
to
meet
a
situation
that
can
be
corrected
without
a
decision
of
this
court
on
a
point
that
is
not
before
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
write
an
opinion
and
cite
you
for
an
authority.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
true
normally
that
you
don't
recover
unless
you
litigate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
imagine
certain
benefits
are
available,
like
gambling,
but
i
mean,
if
you've
got
a
cause
of
action,
don't
you
have
to
litigate
in
order
to
recover?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
had
to
have
a
party
to
a
litigation,
a
party
in
interest
in
that
litigation,
and
although
you
can
have
a
class,
you
had
to
have
at
least
one
named
party
who
had
that
interest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
this
case,
does
dr.
winter
represent
the
whole
group?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
read
the
language?
you've
got
it
right
there.
why
don't
you
read
it?
