unknown
speaker
--of
course,
this
is
mr.
ringer's
position,
the
one
that
justice
o'connor
refers
to,
isn't
it?
mr.
ringer's.
unknown
speaker
no,
that
he...
he
is
in
a
position
where
he
wants
this
procedure,
but
can't
afford
to
pay
for
it,
and
how
does
he
find
out?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
kneedler,
in
diaz,
the
secretary
did
raise
the
exhaustion
point.
unknown
speaker
subsequently
rejected
in
salfi?
salfi
came
before
that.
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
in
diaz,
the
secretary
continued
to
litigate
the
exhaustion
issue
all
the
way
to
this
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
ask
us
to
modify
diaz
today?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
is
it
not
correct
that
if
the
secretary's
regulation
means
what
it
says,
the
alj's
will
be
under
a
duty
in
the
future
to
deny
all
these
claims?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
take
it
in
two
steps.
first,
an
operation
performed
today,
the
claim
must
be
denied
under
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
secretary's
position
with
respect
to
the
three
parties
here
who
had
the
operations
before
but
who
have
not
had
their
cases
ruled
on?
unknown
speaker
so
the
secretary
does
not
take
the
position
that
the
ruling
applies
to
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kneedler,
i
suppose
as
to
the
three
or
however
many
people
there
were
who
had
the
operation
before
the
regulation
was
issued--
unknown
speaker
--or
before
that
october
date,
or
whatever
it
was.
unknown
speaker
--i
wouldn't
think
they
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
ruling
at
all
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
without
regard
to
405(g)
or
(h)
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
even
1331.
unknown
speaker
and
the
people
who
haven't
had
the
operation,
you
say,
haven't
any
basis
for
a
suit
at
all
anyway.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
part
of
this
case.
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
the
person
who
hasn't
had
the
operation,
and
can't
afford
to
have
it
unless
it
is
going
to
be
reimbursed,
certainly
has
some
kind
of
an
interest.
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
before.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
have
to
make
any
special
argument
in
response
to
the
suggestion
or
the
claim
that
the
secretary
had
no
authority
to
issue
this
kind
of
a
regulation
foreclosing
alj's
from
making
decisions?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
how
the
secretary
is
going
to
answer
it,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
secretary
has
issued
the...
has
certainly
issued
the
regulation
and
asserts
the
authority
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
in
this
manner,
rather
than
by
the
adjudication
of--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
sort
of
a
procedural
claim.
unknown
speaker
how
about
eldridge?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
real
bootstrap.
the
claim
is
that
you
can
get
into
court
without
having
the
operation,
and
you
must
be
able
to
get
into
court.
unknown
speaker
again,
who,
when
this
case
was
started,
who
had
what
you
might
call
standing
to
press
the
case?
i
know
it
was
a
class
action,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
was
two
classes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
concede...
you
think
there
was
standing
in
all
of
these
plaintiffs
to--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
to
have...
so
the
court
could
reach
the
questions
at
least
that
we
are
faced
with
now.
unknown
speaker
but
if
somebody
filed
suit,
just
said,
i
read
that
regulation
the
secretary
issued,
and
i
want
to
challenge
it,
somebody
who
isn't
even
interested
in
having
the
operation,
you
certainly
would
throw
him
out
of
court
without
ever
getting
into
these
questions.
unknown
speaker
you
think
all
of
these
people
are
different
from
that?
from
that
person?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
standing.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
segments
outside
southern
california?
unknown
speaker
who
in
this
case
has
standing,
can,
you
say,
invoke
405
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
standing
to
challenge
it,
but
he
certainly
wouldn't
be
invoking
405
for
jurisdiction,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
he?
how
could
he?
he
would
just
have
to
qualify
under
1331,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
you
can
get
judicial
review
under
405
without
ever
having
an
operation
or
filing
a
claim
or
anything
of
the
sort.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
the
case
has
been
going
on...
how
long
has
the
case
been
going
on?
unknown
speaker
and
couldn't
someone
have
the
operation
just
a
few
weeks
later
than
this
complaint
was
filed,
and
we
wouldn't
have
all
these
procedural
problems?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
you
don't
have
among
the
parties
here
a
person
who
everybody
agrees
is
covered
by
the
new
regulation,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
if
we
just
vacated,
sent
it
back,
you
could
amend
and
do
all
of
that,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
harkins,
i
thought
mr.
kneedler
suggested
that
even
the
three
who
had
the
operation
before
the
regulation
came
out
might
have
standing,
technical
standing,
article
3
standing
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
regulation
because
it
would
affect
nevertheless
the
disposition
of
their
cases.
unknown
speaker
it
would
make
alj's
much
more
likely
to
turn
them
down.
unknown
speaker
at
least
that's
a
claim
enough
to
give
you
technical
standing,
you
suggest,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
in
which
event
then
we
have
to
reach
these
other
questions,
you
are
arguing.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
the
alj's
deny...
how
could
they
refuse
to
follow
that?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
understand
why
it
wouldn't
be
controlling
in
every
one
of
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
citation
in
the
federal
register,
if
you
have
it
before
you
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sure
you
hope
that
justice
stevens
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
say
in
so
many
words
that
it
will
not
apply
to
operations
that
took
place
before?
