mr.
kneedler,
can
the
claim
be
made
before
the
surgery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
how
it
is
possible
for
someone
who
wants
the
surgery
performed
to
get
a
determination
about
reimbursement
before
having
the
surgery?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
view,
is
there
any
way
at
all
that
a
person
could
get
that
kind
of
determination--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
for
someone
looking
at
elective
surgery,
something
that
isn't
going
to
done
no
matter
what,
and
of
modest
means,
it
does
put
them
in
a
difficult
position,
doesn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
as
to
surgery
performed
after
the
secretary's
new
regulation,
and
under
the
regulation
it
provides
that
this
particular
procedure
would
never
be
reimbursed,
approved
for
reimbursement,
why
doesn't
it
fall
under
the
mathews
against
diaz
exception
as
a
waiver
of
exhaustion
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
in
the
future,
though,
where
the
only
issue
is
whether
recovery
can
be
had
for
this
particular
surgery,
and
in
the
face
of
the
rule
that
has
been
adopted?
why
is
it
anything
but
futile
to
exhaust
an
administrative
remedy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
the
better
argument
is
that
somehow
the
secretary
has
waived
the
exhaustion
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
jurisdiction
under
section
1361,
mandamus?
i
guess
our
prior
cases
really
haven't
answered
that
question,
have
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
courts
of
appeals
have
been
allowing
mandamus
actions
in
various
jurisdictions
under
1361.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
cases
like
the
one
argued
here
recently,
heckler
versus
day,
that
have
to
do
with
the
time
limits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
here,
i
guess...
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
harkins,
have
all
the
claims
which
have
been
allowed
by
administrative
law
judges
occurred
in
california
or
that
region?
