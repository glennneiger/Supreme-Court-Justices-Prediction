mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
respondents'
position
here
that
there
are
only
two
issues
which
the
court
needs
to
address.
the
first
is
that
the
secretary
is
telling
this
court
that
she
has
the
unfettered
discretion
to
determine
when
judicial
review
is
available
under
section
405,
that
her
determination
on
finality
is
binding
on
this
court,
and
that
this
court
cannot
look
behind
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
the
second
question,
which
i
will
come
back
to
after
addressing
the
first,
is
a
question
that
the
secretary
completely
ignores,
and
that
is
the
one
of
how
are
medicare
beneficiaries
who
are
too
poor
to
advance
the
cost
of
treatment
and
obtain
the
surgery
ever
able
to
file
a
claim
to
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
or
to
obtain
a
determination
of
their
eligibility
for
benefits?
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
the
government
can.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that
might
be
the
case,
sir,
but
i
think
that
this
is
a
different
situation,
in
that
the
policy,
the
ruling
in
this
instance
precludes
recipients
from
obtaining
treatment
which
in
ten
out
of
eleven
cases,
that
is,
ten
out
of
eleven
administrative
law
judges
have
held
that
they
are
entitled
to,
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
aspect
of
this
case
which
makes
it
unique
and
distinguishes
it
from
the
situation
which
you
suggest.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--that
is
correct,
but
in
this
case
the
complaint
alleges,
and
in
fact
there
was
an
affidavit
presented
to
the
district
court
that
mr.
ringer
would
in
fact
have
the
procedure
if
coverage
were
available,
but
that
he
was
unable
to
do
so
solely
because
of
the
secretary's
coverage
determination.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
first
of
all,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
that
is
a
question
which
has
already
been
resolved
by
the
secretary's
appeals
council
and
by
her
administrative
law
judges,
and
that
is
something
that
has
not
been
presented
to
the
district
court,
and
which
we
frankly
believe
the
district
court
should
not
have
to
address
in
this
case.
there
is
some
disagreement,
however,
with
respect
to
the
utility
of
the
treatment.
however,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
appeals
council
found
that
it
was
reasonable
and
necessary
in
the
cases
before
it,
and
also
found
that
there
are
segments
of
the
medical
community
which
do
prescribe
this
treatment
and
are
in
fact
of
support
of
it.
with
respect
to
the
first
issue--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--there
have
been,
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
appeals
council
record
of
other
doctors,
one
in
north
carolina,
for
instance,
one
in
west
virginia,
and
in
some
other
areas
who
have
used
this
treatment
in
given
cases,
sir.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
405
jurisdiction,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
question
that
jurisdiction
is
available
under
section
405
here,
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
only
way
that
the
court
can
conclude
that
there
is
no
section
405
jurisdiction
is
to
accept
the
secretary's
invitation
to
first
of
all
ignore
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
to
ignore
the
holdings
in
salfi
and
eldridge
and
diaz.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
first
of
all,
the
question
of
standing,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
has
not
been
raised
in
the
case.
it
was
not
addressed--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--okay.
it
is
our
position
that
the
class
of
claimants
includes
those
who
have
had
their
claims
denied
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
think
that
that
may
be
a
question
that
the
district
court
needs
to
address
in
the
first
instance.
however,
it
seems
to
me
that
at
worst,
this
may
be
a
situation
where
we
have
to
amend
the
complaint
to
add
a
group
of
individuals,
of
named
individuals
that
fall
into
that
category.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
okay.
i
also
believe
that
mr.
ringer
insofar
as
he
has
been
dissuaded
from
having
this
treatment
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ruling
would
have
standing
to
challenge
it.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that.
i
think
that
he
can.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
think
that
in
order
to
find
that
mr.
ringer--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
thing
that
makes
this
case
different
is
that
the
secretary
has
taken
a
position
which
is
final
and
is
binding,
and
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
do
is,
we
have
to
go
back
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
medicare
act
in
order
to
answer
your
question.
any
number
of
courts
have
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
alleviate
the
burden
that
health
care
imposes
on
the
elderly
and
on
the
sick,
on
those
who
are
least
able
to
afford
it.
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
secretary
is
interpreting
405
in
a
way
that
establishes
a
financial
prerequisite
to
even
being
able
to
get
into
the
system,
to
file
the
claim,
and
then
to
exhaust
the
remedies.
and
i
think
that
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
congress's
purposes
in
establishing
the
medicare
program
that
the
secretary
would
be
able
to
impose
a
financial
requirement
to
get
into
the
system
on
those
who
are
unable
to
foot
the
bill
up
front.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
precisely
what
congress
intended
to
avoid,
was
to
avoid
the
burden
that
health
care
costs
impose
on
these
very
individuals.
and
i
think
that
beyond
that,
if
you
interpret
405
to
preclude
people
like
freeman
ringer
from
getting
into
the
system,
i
think
that
you
are
then
raising
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
as
to
whether
or
not
405
as
applied
to
these
facts
discriminates
against
people
like
mr.
ringer
solely
on
the
basis
of
their
poverty,
because--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--but
in
this
instance,
justice
rehnquist,
i
realize
that
poverty
itself
is
not
an
invidicus
basis
of
discrimination,
but
i
think
that
the
court
should
interpret
405
in
a
fashion
that
avoids
the
need
to
address
that
constitutional
question.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
think
that
the
question
is
one
of
denying
access
to
the
system,
denying
access
to
both
administrative
review
and
judicial
review,
solely
because
of
mr.
ringer's
indigency,
particularly
in
these
facts,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it
has
to
set
up
a
system
of
administrative
declaratory
judgment
proceedings,
but
i
do
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
route
through
which,
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
medicare
act,
that
people
like
mr.
ringer
can
obtain
some
kind
of
determination
of
their
eligibility
for
coverage,
that
they
are
not,
as
this
case
illustrates,
put
in
a
position
of
being
denied
benefits
solely
because
they
can't
even
get
into
the
system
in
the
first
place.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
the
problem
with
that,
justice
stevens,
is
that
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
as
the
complaint
indicates,
mr.
ringer
is
a
person
who
is
suffering
right
now.
he
has
severe
respiratory
illness.
he
is
also
an
elderly
individual.
and
denying
him
access
to
benefits
which
the
administrative
law
judges
are
almost
consistently
ruling
he
is
entitled
to
puts
him
in
a
situation
of
suffering
pain,
of
suffering
disability,
and
there
is
the
possibility
that
mr.
ringer
may
be
dead
and
may
never
have
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
that.
for
instance,
i
point
out
that
three
of
the
six
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
initially
have
died
since
the
case
was
started,
because
they
are
by
definition
elderly
and
ill
people.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
since
about
1980,
roughly.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
among
the
named
parties,
that's
correct.
we
do
not.
but
i
would
suggest,
first
of
all,
that
i
think
that
there
is
at
least
an
argument
that
the
class
will
include
those
individuals.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
that
presents
a
problem,
it
does
not
affect
the
underlying
issue
that
is
in
front
of
this
court
nor
the
issue
that
will
be
presented
to
the
district
court,
because
the
policy
is
effective.
there
are
people
who
are
receiving
the
treatment
at
this
point,
and
the
complaint
can
easily
be
amended
to
include
a
named
individual
that
has
had
the
treatment
and
been
denied
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
in
existence,
as
my
colleague
has
indicated,
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
dr.
winter
himself
serves
as
representative
for
the
patients
in
the
administrative
proceedings
pursuant
to
the
secretary's
own
regulations,
and
we
have
set
that
forth
at
paragraph...
or
footnote
4
of
our
brief.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
it
may
be
that
when
we
get
back
to
the
district
court,
we
do.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
believe
so.
the
reason--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--yes,
it
is,
justice
marshall.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
because
there
are
two
subclasses
in
our
case,
the
one
that
we
have
been
talking
about
for
some
time
with
mr.
ringer,
who
has
not
had
the
treatment
and
therefore
not
filed
a
claim.
the
other
subclass
includes
people
who
have
had
the
treatment
and
have
filed
the
prerequisite
claim.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that
is
correct.
the
named
plaintiffs
did.
we
believe
that
that
class
also
includes
individuals
who
had
the
treatment
after
the
ruling
was
issued
for
this
reason.
that
ruling
essentially
formalizes
a
policy
that
was
in
existence
for
several
years
before
the
ruling
was
published.
it
had
been
in
existence
at
least
since
1972.
the
only
impact
of
that
ruling
is
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
beneficiaries
can
never
win
at
any
stage
in
the
process.
the
class
that
we
allege
that
had
had
the
treatment
and
filed
the
requisite
claims
included
people
who
were
denied
treatment
based
on
the
policy
before
it
was
published.
it
at
that
point
had
been
published
in
manuals
which
were
issued
to
the
secretary's
intermediaries
and
which
the
intermediaries
were
bound
to
follow.
the
effect
of
the
ruling
was
merely
to
take
it
one
step
further
and
to
assure
that
the
administrative
law
judges
as
well
denied
the
claims.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
yes,
we
could,
and
i
suspect
that
we
would
be
back
here
in
short
order,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
because,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
the
underlying
issues
are
affected
by
the
ruling,
except
that
the
ruling
exacerbates
the
situation.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you,
justice
marshall,
is
that
we
are
satisfied
with
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
at
this
point,
and
we
don't
think
that
amendment,
even
if
it
were
necessary,
would
present
any
problem.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
see.
that
would
be
flattering,
but
i
realize
the
problem.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
must
confess,
in
all
the
things
that
we
talked
about
in
preparing
for
argument,
that
is
one
that
hadn't
come
up,
but
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is,
first
of
all,
that
this
case
is
different
because
it
is
not
a
question
where
someone
is
asking
for
an
absolute
assurance
that
coverage
will
be
available.
it
is
a
situation
in
which
the
secretary
has
already
provided
absolute
assurance
that
coverage
is
not
available.
and
secondly,
when
you
get
beyond
that,
i
think
that
the
question
then
becomes
one
of,
on
the
facts,
is
the
decision
sufficiently
final
for
judicial
review,
and
in
this
instance
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
on
the
facts
that
the
decision
is
final
for
purposes
of
judicial
review.
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
the
court
did
in
salfi
and
in
eldridge
and
in
diaz,
that
there
is
absolutely
no
room
for
disagreement
on
that.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
in
that
instance,
those
individuals
are
still
covered
by
the
policy
that
the
secretary
had
issued,
the
informal
policy
that
was
in
place
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
ruling.
now,
if
in
fact
it
is
the
case
that
those
individuals
don't
have
standing
to
challenge
the
ruling,
again,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
situation
that
can
easily
be
cured
by
amendment.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
it
did
not,
because
the
individuals
that
were
involved
in
the
class
of
those
who
had
filed
the
claims
were
denied
initially
and
upon
reconsideration
based
solely
on
the
policy.
they
were
then
put
in
a
position
of
litigating,
and
up
until
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
what
we
had
was
a
situation
that
those
who
litigated
got
benefits
and
those
who
did
not
litigate
did
not
get
benefits,
and
the
award
of
benefits
was
conditioned
not
upon
the
individual
plaintiff's
treatment
or
upon
their
condition,
but
upon
whether
they
survived
long
enough
to
litigate,
whether
they
had
the
resources
and
the
desire
to
litigate.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
in
this
instance
it
is
certainly
true.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
normally
the
case,
though.
i
think
the
benefits
are
normally
available
without
litigation.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action,
yes,
you
do,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question,
sir.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
well,
i
would
suggest
again
that
these
individuals
have
had
their
coverage
denied
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
policy
initially
and
on
reconsideration.
i
believe
that
they
are
in
a
position
where
they
can
at
least
arguably
represent
those
who
have
had
coverage
denied
based
on
the
ruling,
but
in
addition
to
that,
sir,
dr.
winter
is
serving
right
now
as
a
representative
for
individuals
who
are
in
precisely
that
position,
who
have
had
coverage
denied
based
solely
on
the
ruling.
in
fact,
earlier
there
was
a
reference
to
the
administrative
law
judge
proceeding
that
occurred
while
the
lawsuit
was
pending.
there
were
individuals
there
who
were
denied
on
the
merits.
there
was
also
a
group
of
individuals
represented
by
dr.
winter...
in
fact,
the
case
is
stayed
in
re
benjamin
winter
as
representative
for
132
claimants.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
he
represents
at
least
those
who
had
the
treatment
and
were
denied
based
solely
on
the
ruling
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
there
are
about
50,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
the
district
court
never
reached
the
question
of
the
status
of
the
class.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that
is
part
of
his
claim.
it
is
not
that
he
is
seeking
reimbursement,
sir,
but
he
is
appearing
as
a
plaintiff,
as
representative
of
his
patients,
some
of
whom
are
now
in
the
administrative
process.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
the
secretary's
regulations
confer
on
dr.
winter,
and
we
pointed
this
out
in
footnote
4
of
our
brief,
confer
on
dr.
winter
the
status
of
representative--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--i
believe
that
insofar
as
he
is...
he
is
authorized
to
appear
as
representative
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
that
he
is
defined
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
a
party.
he
is
given
the
specific
right
by
the
secretary's
regulations
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
individuals
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
would
think
that
on
judicial
review,
that
he
could
do
exactly
that,
insofar
as
he
is
representative
of
named
individuals
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
well,
i
think
in
fact--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--in
fact,
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here,
because
the
only
claimants
who
have
been
denied
coverage
in
front
of
an
alj
were
those
who
had
not
had
the
treatment
and
the
alj
hearing
occurred
after
the
ruling
was
issued,
and
it
certainly...
the
facts
would
suggest
that
those
claimants
were
biased
by
that
ruling.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
would
think
so.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
the
situation
that
had
existed
prior
to
the
time
that
the
ruling
was
published
was
that
there
was
a
manual
provision
which
provided
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
stipulation
you
just
read.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
the
alj's,
i
think,
were
persuaded
on
looking
at
the
facts
of
the
individual
cases
that
they
should
not
follow
it,
that
they
gave
perhaps
weight
to
that
policy,
but
that
given
the
results
of
the
treatment,
and
listening
to
the
testimony
of
the
individuals
involved,
that
they
could
not
follow
that
policy
provision,
sir.
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
cannot
point
a
finger
at
a
specific
provision
that
says
that
the
alj's
were
not
bound
by
that.
however,
the
alj's
took
the
position
that
the
informal
policy
was
not
binding.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
believe
that
the
ruling
is--
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
--i
believe
the
ruling
itself
states
that
it
was
to
have
prospective
effect
only.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
it
is
in
the
federal
register,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
but
i
do
think
that,
as
i
indicated
a
few
minutes
ago,
that
that
ruling
has
certainly
had
some
effect.
i
find
it
far
more
than
coincidental
that
the
only
administrative
law
judge
out
of
eleven
that
has
denied
coverage
did
so
only
after
that
ruling
was
issued.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
well,
actually,
she
said
that...
it
was
our
position
that
it
was...
excuse
me.
the
secretary
said
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
the
secretary
said,
look,
we
are
tired
of
these
administrative
law
judges
and
the
appeals
council
ruling
against
us
on
this
coverage
question,
and
we
are
going
to
put
an
end
to
that.
the
ruling
on
its
face
says
that
the
purpose
of
the
ruling
was
to
assure
that
the
administrative
law
judges
and
the
appeals
council
never
decided
another
claim
for
this
treatment
against
the
secretary.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
it
is
45
federal
register
71,426,
and
the
date
is
october
28th,
1980.
the
provision
on
the
effective
date
is
on
the
subsequent
page,
71,427.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
would
have
a
difficult
time
disagreeing
with
that.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
there
is
an
entire
paragraph,
sir.
it
says,
"as
explained
above,
we
have
previously
issued
policy
in
manual
instructions
excluding
this
service
from
medicare
coverage.
"
"however,
since
alj's
and
the
appeals
council
have
ruled
in
several
cases
that
claims
for
these
services
are
payable,
it
is
possible
that
some
beneficiaries,
relying
on
these
rulings,
have
proceeded
to
have
the
operation
performed
in
expectation
of
medicare
payment.
"
"in
fairness
to
those
beneficiaries,
we
are
making
the
ruling
effective
for
services
furnished
after
the
date
of
publication.
"
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
no,
justice
o'connor.
there
have
been
ten
different
administrative
law
judges,
26
proceedings,
and
they
have
occurred
all
over
the
country.
i
think
if
i
could
leave
the
court
with
one
point,
i
think
that
point
would
be
that
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
this
court,
the
secretary
has
stated
over
and
over
again
that
the
intent
and
the
effect
of
that
ruling
is
to
bind
the
administrative
law
judges
and
the
appeals
council
and
to
absolutely
prohibit
reimbursement
for
this
treatment.
i
think
that
that
fact
brings
this
case
squarely
within
this
court's
holdings
in
salfi,
in
eldridge,
and
in
diaz,
and
as
much
as
the
secretary
wants
to
ignore
the
rulings
in
those
cases
and
to
quote
language
from
those
cases,
those
decisions
found
jurisdiction
at
least
as
far
as
the
named
plaintiffs
were
concerned.
each
of
those
cases
found
jurisdiction
under
section
405
despite
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
completely
exhausted
the
administrative
process.
in
fact,
salfi
points
out
that
the
named
plaintiffs
had
not
satisfied
the
finality
requirements
imposed
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
in
eldridge
and
diaz,
there
was
a
concession
that
there
had
not
been
complete
exhaustion.
more
than
that,
each
of
those
cases
found
jurisdiction
under
section
405
despite
the
fact
that
the
secretary
had
moved
to
dismiss
in
each
case
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
indeed,
in
eldridge,
the
court
notes
that
the
secretary
made
out
the
same
argument
that
she
makes
here,
that
this
court
is
bound
by
her
determination
on
finality.
and
the
court
answered
that
very
simply:
we
disagree;
and
proceeded
to
look
to
the
merits
of
the
finality
question.
it
suggested
in
each
of
those
cases
that
exhaustion
was
unnecessary
because
the
secretary
had
taken
a
conclusive
position
on
the
issue.
in
eldridge,
it
was
as
a
result
of
a
statutory
provision...
excuse
me...
as
a
result
of
the
impact
of
the
secretary's
regulation.
in
the
other
two
cases,
it
was
the
result
of
a
statutory
provision.
but
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
diaz
in
particular
supports
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit,
because
the
secretary's
counsel
in
colloquy
with
the
district
court
there
as
far
as
one
plaintiff
is
concerned
insisted
that
the
decision...
that
benefits
could
not
be
awarded
to
that
plaintiff.
and
i
think
that
while
the
secretary
never
comes
right
out
in
saying
it,
what
she's
telling
you
is
that
she
wants
you
to
overrule
salfi,
eldridge,
and
diaz.
she
is
actually
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
it
cannot
do
precisely
what
it
did
in
each
of
those
three
cases,
that
you
cannot
look
behind
a
motion
to
dismiss,
or
a
statement
that
further
exhaustion
is
required.
but
i
think
there
is
more
to
it
than
that,
because
when
you
see
the
big
picture,
what
the
secretary,
i
think,
is
really
saying
is
that
this
court
is
bound
by
her
determination
on
finality
but
that
she
can't
be
bound
by
the
decisions
of
the
administrative
law
judges
within
their
jurisdiction
or
by
the
decisions
of
the
federal
court.
i
think
that
when
you
put
this
in
perspective,
the
secretary
is
asking
for
a
license
to
continue
to
ignore
decisions
even
within
the
jurisdiction
in
which
those
decisions
were
rendered.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
in
the
first
instance
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
until
the
court
says
otherwise.
mr.
malcolm
j.
harkins,
iii
i
think
that
that
is
a
question
that
the
secretary
has
committed
to
the
administrative
law
judges
and
given
them
the
authority
to
decide.
thank
you.
