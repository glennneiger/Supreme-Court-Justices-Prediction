mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
questions
of
fundamental
importance
to
the
orderly
administration
and
adjudication
of
the
millions
of
claims
that
are
filed
under
the
social
security
act
each
year.
congress
has
enacted
a
special
self-contained
procedure
for
the
administrative
and
judicial
review
of
social
security
claims,
and
it
has
assigned
to
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
the
responsibility
for
prescribing
the
administrative
steps
in
that
process
that
must
be
pursued
before
a
claimant
seeks
judicial
review.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
however,
excused
the
respondents
from
exhausting
the
administrative
procedures
the
secretary
has
prescribed
before
they
sought
judicial
review
within
the
special
statutory
procedure
that
congress
has
enacted,
and
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
respondents
could
challenge
the
secretary's
interlocutory
decisions
denying
their
claims
outside
of
that
special
procedure
by
bringing
a
separate
action
under
the
general
grants
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
sections
1331
and
1361
of
the
judicial
code.
we
have
sought
review
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
flatly
inconsistent,
in
our
view,
with
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
weinberger
versus
salfi
and
later
cases
with
attached
legislative
history
and
consistent
administrative
implementation
of
the
act.
if
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
were
affirmed
by
this
court,
the
interlocutory
and
piecemeal
review
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
permitted
would
substantially
disrupt
the
administrative
and
judicial
review
of
social
security
claims.
there
is
a
pressing
need
in
this
area
involving
many
claims
for
the
secretary
and
the
courts
to
have
clear
rules
that
can
be
easily
and
uniformly
applied
in
all
cases
without
the
need
to
litigate
in
particular
cases
their
applicability,
and
the
rules
the
secretary
and
congress
have
established
for
this
purpose
are
fair
and
reasonable.
before
stating
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
to
briefly
outline
those
procedures
that
congress
and
the
secretary
have
prescribed.
the
basic
statutory
framework
is
simple
and
straightforward.
it
is
contained
in
section
205
of
the
act,
which
was
enacted
in
1939,
and
is
now
codified
in
section
405
of
title
42.
section
405(b)
directs
the
secretary
to
make
findings
and
decisions
on
claims
for
benefits
under
the
act.
section
405(b)
then
provides
that
if
the
claimant
is
dissatisfied
with
the
secretary's
initial
determination,
the
secretary
must
afford
him
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
on
the
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
under
the
medicare
program,
as
under
most
insurance
programs,
the
claimant
files
a
claim
for
payment
which
can
be
made
only
for
services
that
have
already
been
rendered.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
act
does
not
provide
for
this
sort
of
procedure.
the
administrative
procedure
that
congress
has
established,
particularly
section
405(b),
refers
to
determinations
and
hearings
on
applications
or
determining
the
rights
of
people
who
have
applied
for
payment
under
the
act,
and
a
person
wouldn't
even
have
a
right
to
payment
until
he
applied
for
benefits
after
having
the
surgery.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
person
could
request,
i
suppose,
the
secretary
to
perhaps
offer
advice,
but
for
part
of
the
reasons,
i
suppose,
that
were
developed
in
the
preceding
case
for
one
of
the
intermediaries
to
suggest
the
particular
service
might
be
covered
before
the
person
has
even
had
the
surgery
might
create
problems,
and
ordinarily
the
intermediary
would
decline
to
do
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
might.
in
the
typical
medicare
claim
situation,
the
rules
are
fairly
well
established,
and
by
reference
to
what
private
insurance
carriers
do,
but
even
quite
aside
from
whether...
from
any
policy
of
general
applicability
the
secretary
has,
in
any
individual
case,
surgery
can
only
be
paid
for
if
it
is
reasonable
and
necessary,
and
that
is
a
determination
that
could
not
be
made
until
after
the
individual
had
the
surgery
in
any
event.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
he
is
entitled
to
review
now?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
i
say,
there
is
no
established
procedure
for
that.
as
it
turns
out
in
this
case,
the
physician
who
is
responsible
for
most
of
the...
or
virtually
all
of
this
particular
surgery
is
adjudicating
claims
on...
as
the
representative
for
other
claimants
who
have
had
the
surgery,
so
in
this
particular
instance,
that
doesn't
present
a
problem,
because
the
question
of
the
coverages
will
be
litigated
anyway.
as
i
was
saying,
the
act
in
section
405(b)
provides
for
administrative
hearings,
and
then
also
authorizes
the
secretary
to
conduct
such
other
proceedings
as
are
necessary
to
determine
individual
claims,
and
immediately
after
section
405
was
enacted
in
1939,
the
secretary
established
a
four-level
procedure
for
administrative
review
of
claims,
an
initial
determination,
a
reconsideration,
the
hearing
required
by
the
act,
and
appeals
council
review.
then
the
special
provision
for
judicial
review
is
contained
in
section
405(g),
which
provides
for
review
only
of
the
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
and
the
secretary's
regulations
since
1940
have
made
clear
that
the
final
decision
subject
to
judicial
review
is
that
rendered
after
the
appeals
council
has
looked
at
the
case.
and
then,
to
make
clear
that
all
challenges
to
decisions
on
social
security
claims
are
channeled
through
section
405(g),
section
405(h)
provides
that
no
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
in
any
other
manner
except...
by
a
tribunal
in
any
other
manner
except
under
405(g),
and
section
405(h)
says
that
no
action
may
be
brought
under
any
of
the
general
grants
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
in
mathews
versus
diaz
was
the
same
as
that
in
salfi,
and
that
was...
first
of
all,
those
cases
both
were
limited
to
a
very
narrow
situation
that
is
really
somewhat
unique,
and
that
is
where
the
claimant
is
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
itself.
in
those
circumstances,
there
were...
in
both
those
cases
there
were
special
factors
present.
the
claimant
conceded
that
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute.
the
claimant
conceded
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute...
he
didn't
quarrel
with
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
all
other
issues
were
resolved
except
for
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
of
congress,
which
was
beyond
the
secretary's
competence
to
decide.
and
even
then
the
court
held
in
salfi
that
just
because
a
court
might
believe
that
exhaustion
of
remedies
would
be
futile
does
not
furnish
a
basis
for
the
court
to
excuse
exhaustion.
what
the
court
held,
though,
in
salfi
was
that
the
secretary's
failure
to
contest
the
allegations
of
exhaustion
would
be
deemed
a
waiver
of
exhaustion
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
that
was
the
rationale
explicitly
that
the
court
adopted
in
diaz.
similar
circumstances--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
he...
the
secretary
raised
it
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
would
note
that
the
district
court
rejected
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
diaz
on
the
ground
that
exhaustion
would
be
futile,
which
was
a
ground
that
was
subsequently
rejected
by
this
court
in
salfi.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
district
court's
decision.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
so
that
the
issue
was
rejected
in
district
court,
so
the
secretary
didn't
litigate
it
on
other
grounds.
in
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
his
objection
to
the
exhaustion
issue
in
this
ground,
there
were
several
claimants
in
diaz.
for
two
of
the
claimants,
clara
and
diaz,
the
secretary
conceded
that
under
the
rationale
of
salfi,
because
there
were
no
facts
in
dispute
and
the
statute...
there
was
no
quarrel
about
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
those
two.
the
only
ground
that
the
secretary
objected
to
jurisdiction
over
the
third,
espinoza,
which
the
court
discussed,
was
that
the
secretary
hadn't
issued
a
decision
at
all
on
the
claim,
and
as
it
turns
out,
the
reason
the
secretary
didn't
is
because
the
district
court
had
entered
a
temporary...
or
an
injunction
barring
the
secretary
from
issuing
such
a
decision.
but
the
secretary
litigated
it
in
this
court
really
only
on
that
narrow
ground,
but
the
secretary
did
not
object
to
the...
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--do
we
ask...
no,
we
do
not.
diaz
is
confined,
as
i
said,
to
a
situation
involving
constitutional
claims.
this
case
is
much
different,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
useful
to
point
out
the
contrasts.
it
can't
be
said
here
that
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
facts
of
the
claims
for
benefits.
respondents
vigorously
contest
the
secretary's
view
as
to
whether
this
particular
procedure
is
safe
and
effective.
there
is
also
a
dispute
over
the
meaning,
interpretation,
and
application
of
the
statute,
unlike
in
salfi
and
diaz,
because
here
the
respondents
contend
that
the
secretary
has
misconstrued,
misapplied
the
statute.
in
salfi
and
diaz
that
wasn't
the
case.
another
point
is
that
the
issues--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--assuming
prospectively
after
the
effective
date
of
the
ruling.
as
to
these
respondents,
the
ruling
doesn't
apply
to
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
the
three
who
were
decided
before,
the
formal
ruling
itself
said
that
the
rule
did
not
apply
to
surgery
that
was
performed
before
the
effective
date
of
the
ruling.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and
even
as
to
persons
who
had
the
surgery
after
the
effective
date
of
the
ruling,
the
respondents
argued
in
the
administrative
proceedings,
which
are
still
ongoing,
that
the
ruling
should
not
apply
even
to
them.
there
is
a
technical
argument
that
the
particular
regulation
that
binds
the
appeals
council
and
the
alj's
to
rulings
issued
by
the
health
care
financing
administration
doesn't
apply
to
medicare
cases.
and
so
that
argument
was
made.
so
that's
precisely
the
sort
of
reason
why,
even
though
there's
a
regulation
that
has
been
issued
that
says
a
particular
sort
of
service
is
not
covered,
that
there
should
be
exhaustion,
because
it
will
be
up
to
the
appeals
council
and
the...
and
before
that
the
alj
to
determine
whether
the
regulation
actually
applies
to
these
claimants.
and
it
is
also
important,
i
think,
to
recognize
that
a
ruling
on
the
merits
or
an
issue
involved
in
the
merits
is
really
just
one
aspect
of
a
claim
for
benefits.
in
the
administrative
adjudication
of
a
claim,
just
as
in
the
judicial
determination
of
a
lawsuit,
a
decision
is
reviewed
only
after
final
judgment
which
resolves
all
of
the
issues
in
the
claim.
here,
respondents
are
challenging
just
one
ruling
or
one
regulation,
a
policy.
there
are
other
issues
involved
in
a
claim,
whether
the
person
is
eligible--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
even
if
it
were
futile,
that
would
not
be
a
basis
for
excusing
exhaustion.
this
court
made
explicitly
clear,
stated
several
times
in
salfi
that
the
court's
view
that
exhaustion
might
be
futile
would
not
be
sufficient
to
excuse
exhaustion.
and
in
salfi
itself,
the
statute
barred
the
recovery,
and
precisely
this
argument
could
have
been
made,
that
the
secretary
was
obligated
to
apply
the
statute,
which
would
have
denied
benefits.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
would
be
an
alternative
way
to
look
at
it,
but
to
view
the
issuance
of
a
ruling
of
general
applicability,
this
doesn't
focus
on
a
named
claimant.
it
is
a
ruling
of
general
applicability.
to
find
a
waiver
on
the
basis
of
that
would
really
tear
the
waiver
rationale
from
the
special
circumstances,
narrow
circumstances
that
were
present
in
diaz
and
salfi.
any
time
the
secretary
made
a
statement
of
general
applicability,
a
person
could
go
immediately
into
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
this
case,
in
fact,
there
are
not
a
multitude
of
proceedings.
the
case...
because
they
raise
a
common--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
may
apply
to
large
numbers
of
situations,
but
any
individual's
attempt
to
go
into
court
might
just
be
on
his
own
particular
claims.
he
may
say,
well,
the
secretary
has
a
regulation
that
governs
this,
and
i
want
the
validity
of
that
to
be
determined
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
always
possible
that
the
secretary
would
decide
to
waive
exhaustion
if
he
decided
that
it
was
not
necessary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
enables
the
secretary
to
determine
that
the
regulation
in
fact
applies.
i
mean,
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right,
but
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
believed
that
this
ruling
applied
to
these
respondents,
and
on
that
basis
decided
that
exhaustion
would
be
futile.
as
it
turns
out,
the
ruling
on
which
it
relied
as
an
example
of
futility
did
not
even
apply
to
them.
so
this
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
good
example
of
why
the
court's
own
assessment
that
exhaustion
would
be
futile
is
wrong,
even
where
a
regulation
that
appears
to
bar
recovery
is
thought
by
the
claimant
to
apply,
because
here
it
doesn't
apply
to
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
the
same,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
true.
they
don't
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
they
would
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
they
wouldn't
have
standing
to
challenge
the
regulation
as
such,
but
the
court
of
appeals
also
apparently
viewed
the
regulation
as
some
sort
of
evidence
that
the
secretary
had
made
up
her
mind
as
to
whether
a
particular
type
of
surgery
would
be
covered,
and
i
suppose
the
respondents
could
argue
that
even
if
the
regulation
doesn't
technically
apply
to
them,
the
secretary
has
expressed
a
view
on
this
through
the
issuance
of
this
regulation
that
will
indicate
that
exhaustion
is
futile.
that
is
obviously
not
correct
either,
because
the
issue
is
litigated
on
the
merits
before
the
alj.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
persons
who
have
not
had
the
surgery?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
true
that
he
has
an
interest,
but
the
statute
simply
does
not
provide
for
a
means
of
adjudicating
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
although
the
basis
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision
in
this
case
that
it
was
not
reasonable
and
necessary
was
not
related
to
her
personally.
it
was
a
determinated
based...
the
broader
determination
that
the
procedure
isn't
safe
and
effective.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
it
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pre-surgery,
but
you
are
correct,
it
is
possible
in
a
case
like
this
that
the
alj
would
decide,
even
if
the
regulation
applied,
that
for
reasons
particular
to
the
individual,
she
didn't
have
the
condition
that
would
have
warranted
the
surgery
even
if
compensation
can
be
paid
for
bcpr
surgery.
it
also
provides
an
opportunity
for
the
appeals
council
and
the
alj
to
receive
any
evidence
that
the
claimant
might
want
to
present
to
attack
the
rule
on
arbitrary
and
capricious
grounds
if
the
claimant
is
going
to
subsequently
seek
judicial
review.
any
opportunity
the
claimant
might
want
to
make
a
record
on
that
question,
the
alj
and
the
appeals
council
could
receive
evidence
on
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
far
as
the
exhaustion
question
goes,
that
can
be
reviewed
on
a
judicial
review
under
section
405(g),
on
a
review
of
the
secretary's
final
decision.
that
claim
will
not
be
lost
in
the
adjudication
of
the
individual
claims.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
true,
but
he--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that's
true,
but
even
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
secretary
did
not
have
authority
to
do
that,
i
don't
know--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
fact
that
it's
procedural
does
not
take
it
outside
of
the
scope
of
section
405(g).
from
1940
on
it
has
been
clear
that
procedural
claims,
and
as
this
court
held
in
salfi,
constitutional
claims,
all
sorts
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
eldridge
was
a
claim,
though,
that
was
entirely
collateral
to
the
merits.
it
wasn't
that
it
was...
it
wasn't
simply
that
it
was
procedural,
because
under,
for
instance,
under
the
collateral
order
doctrine
this
court
has
adopted
under
section
1291
for
appeals
from
district
court
decisions,
it
is
not
enough
that
a
claim
be
procedural
in
order
to
obtain
immediate
review.
there
are
all
sorts
of
issues,
such
as
the
disqualification
of
counsel
the
court
decided
last
week
that
may
be
procedural,
but
that
is
not
enough
to
obtain
immediate
review.
it
also
has
to
be
a
claim
that
is
entirely
separate
from
the
merits,
and
it
has
to
be
effectively
unreviewable
on
review
of
the
final
decision,
and
that
was
true
of
the
right
to
a
pretermination
hearing
in
mathews
versus
eldridge,
because
the
asserted
right
to
a
pretermination
hearing
could
not
be
vindicated
in
subsequent
proceedings
after
the
benefits
were
terminated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
reason
here
again
is
that
one
can't
even
get
into
the
section
405
procedure,
administrative
review
process,
without
filing
an
application.
just
as
under
mathews
and
salfi
the
filing
of
an
application
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite...
it
can't
be
waived
by
anyone...
to
getting...
to
filing
a
claim,
here
the
claimants
cannot
file
an
application
for
benefits
and
therefore
invoke
the
administrative
procedure
without
filing
an
application
for
benefits.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
speaking
about
invoking
section
405
of
the
act.
this
court
made
clear
in
salfi
and
eldridge
that
the
filling
of
an
application
for
benefits,
application
for
payments,
is
jurisdictional.
now,
the
act...
the
scheme
congress
established
simply
did
not
provide
for
people
to
get
advisory
opinions,
declaratory
judgments
in
advance
of
their
surgery
as
to
whether
a
particular
medical
procedure
would
be
covered.
respondents
cite
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
am
certain
that
it
could
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
should
think
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
standing...
there
were
three
claimants
who
had
the
surgery.
they
had
standing,
i
suppose,
in
the
sense
that
they
were
injured,
but
they
had
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies,
so
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
even
though
they
had...
they
had
the
surgery
and
properly
sought
administrative
review.
they
hadn't
finished
the
step.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
that
it
could...
it
could
reach
the
jurisdictional
questions,
yes.
that
is
correct.
claimant
winter
we
don't...
or
ringer,
and
winter,
the
physician,
we
don't
concede
have
standing,
because
the
statutory
scheme
simply
did
not
provide
for--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
the
system--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--respondent
ringer
is
in
the
position
of
someone
who
hasn't
had
the
surgery.
the
other
three
who
have
at
least
have
satisfied
the
requirement
of
filing
an
application,
but
they
haven't
satisfied
the
exhaustion
requirement
for
bringing
a
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
would
have
to
exhaust
his
remedies.
that
is
clear.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the...
immediately
after
section
405
was
passed
in
1940,
the
secretary
promulgated
the
regulations
that
require
the
four-step
procedure.
congress
amended
the
medicare
act
in
1966
and
explicitly
provided
for
review
according
to
405(b)
and
405(g),
which
must
be
seen
in
these
circumstances
as
a
ratification
of
the
provision
that
the
claimant
exhaust
his
remedies.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make,
though,
is
that
this
does
not
have
to
be
a
prolonged
process.
if
the
claimant
files
a
request
for
an
alj
hearing,
and
the
alj
looks
at
the
case
and
says,
there
are
no
facts
in
dispute
here,
and
if
the
respondent
agrees
and
doesn't
want
a
hearing,
the
alj
can
decide
it
without
a
hearing,
and
the
hhs
hearings
manual
directs
the
alj's
to
try
to
dispose
of
such
cases
in
30
days,
and
if
in
fact
the
claimant's
claim
is
covered
by
a
regulation
that
appears
to
govern,
the
appeals
council
could
be
expected
to
deny
review.
so
we
are
talking
about
a
relatively
short
period
of
time,
but
it
is
an
important
period
of
time,
because,
as
i
say,
it
gives
the
alj
and
the
appeals
council
the
opportunity
to
make
sure
that
the
claim
can't
be
awarded
on
other
grounds
or
isn't
invalid
for
other
reasons.
it
gives
the
alj
and
the
appeals
council
the
opportunity
to
construe
the
regulations
and
to
provide
some
basis
of
reasoning
to
support
the
secretary's
position
on
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
haven't
in
so
many...
in
so
many
words,
but
the
obvious
thrust
of
salfi
and
eldridge
and
diaz
has
been,
i
think,
that
which
congress
intended,
which
was
to
channel
all
challenges
to
an
interlocutory
decision
of
the
secretary
through
section
405(g),
and
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
have,
but
a
number
of
the
decisions
arose
before
this
court
gave
its
full
scope
to
section
405(g).
it
is
now
clear
that
405(g)
is
a
fully
satisfactory,
self-contained
system.
for
a
truly
crucial
collateral
claim,
a
person
doesn't
have
to
exhaust
his
remedies.
now,
that
would...
under
eldrigdge,
given
that,
there
is
no
need
for
a
person
to
go
outside
the
statutory
review
procedure
and
invoke
mandamus
jurisdiction,
and
both
the
second
and
third
sentences
of
section
405(h)
in
our
view
bar
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
would
view
that
as
a
case
in
which
the
issue
was
collateral
under
mathews
versus
eldridge,
that
if
the
person
had
to
exhaust
his
remedies,
his
claim
to
an
immediate
hearing
would
have
been
lost,
couldn't
be
effectively
reviewed
on
review
of
the
secretary's
final
judgment
on
the
claim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
several
things.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
my
opponent
who
is
asking
this
court
to
overrule
salfi.
this
court
could
not
have
been
clearer
in
salfi
that
a
court
cannot
substitute
its
judgment
for
whether
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedies
would
be
futile
for
that
of
the
secretary.
if
the
prohibition
in
the
1980
heckler
ruling
that
the
respondents
challenged
here
had
been
in
the
statute
under
salfi,
the
court
could
not
have
waived
exhaustion.
the
court
said
that.
the
basis
of
the
finding
of
jurisdiction
in
salfi
was
that
the
court
deemed
the
secretary
to
have
waived
exhaustion.
this
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
from
salfi,
because
here
it
is
a
regulation,
an
issue
arising
under
the
statute,
not
a
question
beyond
the
competence
of
the
secretary,
as
in
salfi,
the
constitutional
question.
there
is
no
stipulation
here,
as
in
salfi
and
diaz,
that
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
there
is
no
stipulation
here
that
the
respondents
and
the
secretary
agree
on
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
statute
in
question.
those
are
the
very
reasons
why
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
is
appropriate.
while
respondent
argues
in
this
court
that
the
secretary
has
taken
a
firm
position
on
this
ruling
that
won't
be
changed
because
of
this
binding
regulation,
the
respondents
have
argued
in
the
administrative
proceeding
that
that
regulation
is
not
binding.
not
only
is
it
not
binding
on
the
people
who
had
the
surgery
before
1980,
but
they
argued
that
it
wasn't
even
binding
on
the
people
who
had
the
surgery
after
1980,
because
of
the
particular
interpretation
of
the
regulations.
that
is
the
very
reason
why
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
should
be
required
even
when
a
person
is
challenging
the
regulations,
because
it
gives
the
secretary,
through
the
appeals
council
and
the
alj's,
the
opportunity
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
whether
the
regulation
applies
and
what
the
statute
means.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
goes
to
the
question
of
mr.
ringer
having
standing.
the
reason
mr.
ringer
cannot
bring
a
lawsuit
is
because
congress
has
foreclosed
it.
the
only
available
way
of
judicial
review
is
under
section
405(g)
of
the
act,
which
requires
a
filing
of
an
application.
congress
foreclosed
judicial
review
under
1331
and
61,
and
the
system
would
break
down
with
200
million
medicare
claims
filed
a
year
on
behalf
of
people
who
have
already
had
services
if
beyond
that
a
claimant
could
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
when
it
is
still
speculative
as
to
whether
he
would
be
reimbursed
for
the
surgery.
