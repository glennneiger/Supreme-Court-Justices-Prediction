justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
recall
in
besio's
claim
the
administrative
law
judge
decided
not
that
this
kind
of
an
operation
could
never
be
reimbursed,
but
that
it
was
just
not
a
reasonable
and
necessary
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
suppose
even
though
the
secretary
may
have
adopted
a
regulation
that
this
operation
is
not
reimbursible,
period,
in
proceedings
before
an
administrative
law
judge
the
thing
could
go
off
on
other
grounds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
based
on
the
secretary's
regulation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
of
the
named
plaintiffs
who
are
in
that
class?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
class
can't
possibly
include
them,
i
would
think,
since
if
none
of
the
named
plaintiffs
have
that
characteristic,
they
couldn't
represent
a
class
that
had
that
characteristic.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
you
should
go
back
to
answering
justice
white's
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
constitutional
question
would
that
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
have
held
that
poverty
is
not
an
invidious
basis
of
discrimination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
poverty
is
not
an
invidicus
classification,
what
substantial
constitutional
question
would
there
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
that
the
constitution
requires
congress
to
set
up
a
system
of
administrative
declaratory
judgment
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
look
at
the
facts
of
these
particular
named
parties
for
a
minute.
now,
ringer
is
the
one
who
has
not
had
the
operation.
is
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
other
three
had
the
operation,
and
are
now
in
the
administrative
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
agreed
that
the
secretary's
regulation
doesn't
govern
the
claim
of
any
one
of
those
three.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
unless
you
are
right
about
ringer
having
kind
of
a
constitutional
right
to
get
an
an
administrative
declaratory
judgment,
none
of
those
four
parties
really
have
standing
to
challenge
the
secretary's
regulation
as
she
would
have
it
applied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
perhaps
before
the
ninth
circuit
or
this
court
should
have
to
pass
on
the
question,
we
ought
to
have
a
complaint
that
actually
raises
the
question,
and
i
would
think
also
that
perhaps...
it
seems
to
me
part
of
your
argument
for
challenging
the
secretary's
regulation
is
that
it
is
kind
of
an
ironclad,
no
holds
barred
type
of
thing.
you
lose
in
this
kind
of
suit,
whatever
you
do.
i
would
think
an
informal
policy
would
have
less
of
those
manifestations
than
an
actual
regulation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that?
did
the
district
court
make
that
finding,
that
dr.
winter
was
a
class
representative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
dr.
winter's
claim
was
that
he
wanted
to
perform
some
more
of
these
operations,
not
that
he
was
seeking
reimbursement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
standing
does
he
have
in
that
capacity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
she
can't
confer
standing
in
the
court,
can
she?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he
can
come
into
the
district
court...
i
take
it
he
is
not
an
attorney...
and
simply
say,
i
represent
20
plaintiffs
under
an
administrative
regulation.
none
of
them
have
to
be
named
parties
in
this
court.
just
take
my
word
for
it.
