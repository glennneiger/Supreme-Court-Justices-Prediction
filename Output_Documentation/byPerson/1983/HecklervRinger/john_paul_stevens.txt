justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
in
the
secretary's
interest
to
have
the
validity
of
this
position
determined
as
early
as
possible?
say
you
have
1,000
people
who
have
had
this
operation,
and
you
can
get
all
1,000
cases
decided
at
once.
why
do
you
want
999
administrative
proceedings
to
have
the
single
issue
decided?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
is
only
important,
as
you
explained
to
us,
because
of
its
general...
that
it
may
apply
to
large
numbers
of
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assume
100
people
had
this
operation.
call
it
operation
x.
the
secretary
has
a
rule
that
says
nobody
gets
reimbursed
for
operation
x.
and
somebody
has
got
a
claim
on
file,
so
he
comes
within
the
statute.
would
you
say
the
secretary
would
require
exhaustion
of
all
100
claims
before
being
willing
to
let
the
matter
reach
adjudication?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
totally
futile,
why
should
the
court
wait
for
the
secretary
to
say...
what
is
the
purpose
to
be
served?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
no
doubt
about
it,
if
it
is
a
particular...
there
isn't
any
question
about
this
being
the
kind
of
operation
that
is
covered
by
the
regulation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
that
reasoning
apply
to
a
preoperation
hearing
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
that
even
if
one
of
the
three
had
had
the
operation
after
the
regulation
was
effective.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
might
possibly
be
a
solution?
why
wouldn't
it
have
been
possible
for
someone
in
1981
who
could
afford
the
operation...
there
are
such
people,
i
am
sure,
in
the
area
where
this
doctor
practices...
to
have
the
operation
and
then
start
this
whole
proceeding
and
challenge
the
regulation
in
that
proceeding,
and
then
mr.
ringer
could
get
the
benefit
of
that
ruling
if
it
held
the
regulation
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess
i
am
still
puzzled
about
why
the
ruling
doesn't
apply
to
pending
cases.
i
know
mr.
kneedler
agreed...
said
it
did
not
apply,
but
if
i
read
your
stipulation,
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
this
particular
operation
is
excluded
from
medicare
coverage
under
the
authority
of
section
1862(a)(1).
isn't
that
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
secretary
that
should
be
binding
on
the
alj's
even
with
respect
to
earlier
filed
claims?
why
isn't
that
binding
on
the
alj's?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
this
is
surely
not
an
informal
policy,
where
there
is
a
formal
ruling
that
this
is
not
covered
within
the...
not
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
i
should
think
that
would...
i
don't
know
why
that
wouldn't
apply
to
a
claim
filed
in
advance
as
well
as
one
filed
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
don't
understand
the
law,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can...
has
prospective
effect
only
whether
this
operation
is
reasonable?
well,
that's
what
the
regulation
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
does
it
say
that?
i
can't
find
it
in
the
papers.
is
it
in
the
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
not
in
anything
that
you
people
have
filed
with
us?
we
have
to
read
the
federal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
am
not
surprised
that
it
had
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
my
problem.
she
said
this
is
for
the
future
only,
that
this
operation
may
have
been
reasonable
in
the
past,
but
it
is
unreasonable
in
the
future.
i
can't
understand
that
kind
of
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
very
brief...
the
language
that
says
it
is
prospective
only
is
just...
gives
an
effective
date?
is
that
all?
