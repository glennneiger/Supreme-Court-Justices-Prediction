mr.
charles
hieken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
when
constitutional
rights
are
involved
appellate
judges
who
did
not
hear
the
witnesses
testify
can
conduct
a
de
novo
review
of
the
cold
printed
record
of
a
lengthy
bench
trial
unrestrained
by
the
clearly
erroneous
requirements
of
rule
52(a)
or
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
reverse
the
findings
of
the
u.s.
district
court
judge
who
heard
the
witnesses
testify.
in
1967
dr.
amar
g.
bose,
a
professor
of
electrical
engineering
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology,
invented
the
901
loudspeaker
system.
the
design
of
the
901
loudspeaker
system
was
based
on
12
years
of
research
at
mit.
in
1968
bose
began
marketing
the
loudspeaker
and
the
901
loudspeaker
met
with
success
in
the
market
place.
the
district
court
had
found
that
the
bose
901
had
received
the
best
reviews
which
had
been
given
to
a
loudspeaker
product.
then
in
1970
respondent
consumers
union
published
an
article
entitled
24
medium
priced
loudspeakers
based
on
tests
and
measurements
conducted
in
its
laboratories
by
its
engineers
including
the
use
of
panelists.
the
article
also
reported
on
tests
conducted
of
some
higher
priced
loudspeakers
under
the
heading
"some
loudspeakers
of
special
interest".
one
of
these
loudspeakers
of
special
interest
was
the
bose
901
loudspeaker
system.
the
district
court
found
that
the
article
as
a
whole
disparaged
the
901
loudspeaker
system.
in
particular
the
district
court
found
that
one
statement
was
actionable
in
that
it
was
false
and
disparaging.
based
on
observations
of
panelists
playing
recordings
through
the
bose
901
loudspeaker
system,
the
article
reported
"worse
individual
instruments
heard
through
the
bose
system
tended
to
wonder
about
the
room.
"
the
district
court
judge
then
determined
that
bose
was
a
public
figure
and
would
be
required
to
meet
the
actual
malice
test
of
new
york
times
and,
therefore,
had
to
prove
that
cu
knew
of
the
falsity
of
the
statement
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
what
the
district
court
judge
did
was
to
focus
on
the
knowledge
of
the
author
of
the
statement,
a.
l.
seligson
who
was
the
engineer
in
charge
of
conducting
the
tests
and
who
actually
wrote
the
article.
he
was
one
of
the
two
panelists
who
participated
in
the
test
upon
which
the
false
statement
was
based.
well,
when
the
article
came
out
bose
complained
promptly.
they
tried
to
set
up
a
meeting
as
soon
as
possible
with
cu.
finally
in
june
of
1970
the
meeting
was
held
and
dr.
bose
went
to
this
meeting.
he
told
the
people
there,
look,
it
is
scientifically
impossible
for
a
loudspeaker
system
to
make
instruments
wonder
about
the
room
when
heard
through
a
loudspeaker.
so
he
asked
for
a
demonstration
there.
they
had
the
loudspeakers
there.
it
would
have
taken
a
half
hour
to
set
up
the
demonstration
according
to
the
testimony
of
seligson
who
was
at
the
meeting.
but
its
association
technical
director,
monte
florman,
refused
to
put
on
the
demonstration.
dr.
bose
again
asked
for
the
demonstration,
and
again
the
demonstration
was
refused.
so
dr.
bose
asked
mr.
seligson
to
please
identify
the
recordings
that
had
been
used
to
observe
the
strange
phenomena
of
instruments
wondering
about
the
room.
seligson
said
that
he
would
supply
those
recordings
but
he
never
did
and,
therefore,
as
the
district
court
found
at
the
conclusion
of
the
damage
trial
bose
could
not
refute
the
false
statement
by
demonstrating
to
customers
and
dealers
that
in
fact
instruments
heard
through
the
bose
system
did
not
wander
about
the
room
when
using
the
same
recordings
that
consumers
union
had
allegedly
used
during
the
test.
well,
bose
sought
a
retraction.
it
was
refused
so
bose
sued
in
1971.
finally
in
1980
there
was
a
trial
on
the
liability
question
first.
low
and
behold
at
the
trial
we
now
learn
why
cu
refused
to
demonstrate
the
loudspeakers
or
to
identify
the
recordings.
the
reason,
because
at
the
trial
it
came
out
the
panelists
never
heard
instruments
through
the
bose
system
that
tended
to
wander
about
the
room.
now
the
false
and
disparaging
statement
was
based
on
a
special
listening
test
conducted
in
the
special
listening
room
that
consumers
union
had.
it
was
a
room
about
18
feet
wide
and
about
24
feet
long.
at
one
end
of
the
room--
mr.
charles
hieken
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
they
had
set
these
loudspeakers
at
the
end
of
the
room
about
10
feet
apart
and
supposedly
they
played
recordings
through
them.
at
the
trial...
by
the
way,
you
probably
know
what
stereo
sound
is
that
you
have
a
speaker
at
the
left
and
a
speaker
at
the
right
just
as
in
this
courtroom
to
the
left
of
the
bench
there
is
a
column
of
three
speakers
and
similarly
to
the
right.
mr.
charles
hieken
that
is
probably
because
we
are
sending
the
signals
and
faced
both
channels
simultaneously
so
you
get
mono,
right.
put
in
stereo...
you
are
exactly
right
though
because
now
you
are
observing
what
happens
when
both
left
and
right
loudspeakers
receive
sound
energy
of
the
same
intensity.
the
sound
appears
to
come
from
the
middle.
now
if
you
were
to
turn
down
the
loudspeaker
at
your
left
you
would
hear
the
sound
coming
from
the
right,
and
if
you
turned
down
the
intensity
of
the
sound
at
the
right
you
would
hear
the
sound
coming
from
the
left.
that
is
just
what
happens
in
a
stereo
system.
gradually
they
raised
the
level
of
the
left
and
then
in
the
right
and
the
net
impact
on
you
is
that
you
hear
instruments
that
come
from
various
points
between
the
two
loudspeakers
and
that
is
normal
stereo
sound.
you
can
try
it
at
home
on
your
own
stereo
system
by
taking
your
balance
control
and
moving
it
to
the
left
and
then
to
the
right.
you
will
get
the
same
effect.
that
is
basically
what
seligson
and
lefkow
testified
they
heard
at
the
special
listening
test.
now
they
said
that
they
observed
movement
on
only
one
instrument.
that
one
instrument
was
the
violin
sounds,
and
they
said
that
the
movement
was
restricted
to
movement
between
the
left
and
the
right
loudspeaker.
it
did
not
wander
about
the
room.
now
during
cross
examination
seligson
and
lefkow
each
drew
on
large
charts
exactly
what
they
heard
during
the
special
listening
test
and
reproductions
of
those
drawings
are
included
in
petitioner's
brief
after
page
12.
one
of
them
is
plaintiff's
exhibit
29.
that
was
the
drawing
that
seligson
made.
the
loudspeakers
are
represented
as
small
pentagons
at
one
end
of
the
wall,
and
they
look
much
like
home
plate
in
a
baseball
game.
seligson
drew
a
red
line
between
the
loudspeakers
with
arrowheads
at
each
end
and
the
various
violin
sounds
came
from
various
points
on
that
line
between
the
loudspeakers
and
from
nowhere
else.
lefkow
drew
something
somewhat
similar
on
plaintiff's
exhibit
35
which
is
a
small
red
rectangle
between
the
left
and
right
loudspeakers,
and
the
sounds
came
from
that
region
and
nowhere
else
and
only
on
the
violin.
the
piano
sounds
did
not
wander
they
testify.
well,
on
cross
examination
after
that
drawing
was
completed
seligson
was
asked
why
did
you
use
the
words
"tended
to
wander
about
the
room.
"
to
describe
what
you
had
drawn
on
the
board?
seligson
replied,
"well",
about
"meant
to
me
mean
about
the
rear
wall
between
the
speakers.
"
what
happened,
the
district
court
made
specific
findings.
they
said,
"look.
"
"people
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
movement
along
the
wall
between
the
two
speakers.
"
"that
is
normal
stereo
sound
basically.
"
movement
throughout
the
other
areas
of
the
room
was
not
to
be
expected.
such
a
bizarre
effect
is
contrary
to
what
listeners
are
accustomed
to
and
would
be
objectionable
to
most
listeners.
the
district
court,
of
course,
heard
seligson
testify
on
six
trial
days
and
he
found
that
seligson's
testimony
on
"about
the
room"
meaning
along
the
wall
between
speakers
not
credible
based
on
his
demeanor
and
seligson's
testimony.
in
addition,
the
district
court
found
that
the
testimony
of
cu's
technical
director
who
at
the
time
of
the
tests
was
associate
technical
director
was
wholly
untrustworthy
and
not
credible.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
damage
trial
there
was
an
appeal
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
noticed
found
the
statement
disparaging
and
assumed
it
was
false,
but
then
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
and
said
now
what
we
must
do
is
we
just
perform
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
not
limited
by
the
clearly
erroneous
requirements
of
rule
52(a).
now
in
the
course
of
this
review
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
mention
under
the
heading
"review"
the
state
of
mind
of
the
author
seligson
but
instead
it
focused
on
the
editorial
review
and
in
connection
with
this
editorial
review
it
relied
on
the
testimony
of
monte
florman,
the
associate
technical
director
whose
testimony
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
wholly
untrustworthy
and
not
credible.
in
making
reference
to
wall
maybe
he
was
only
guilty
of
using
imprecise
language
it
appeared
to
be
relying
on
the
testimony
of
seligson
to
the
effect,
well,
what
did
you
want
me
to
say
instead
of
wandered
about
the
room?
would
you
be
happier
if
i
had
said
across
the
wall?
i
think
not.
what
the
court
of
appeals
also
did
is
it
said
it
is
not
enough
for
bose
to
prove
actual
malice
according
to
the
new
york
times
test,
but
bose
had
to
prove
evidence
of
actual
malice
by
showing
evidence
of
negligence,
motive
and
intent.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
well,
we
are
just
unable
to
find
clear
and
convincing
proof
that
consumers
union
knew
that
the
false
and
disparaging
statement
that
it
published
was
false.
well,
there
are
a
number
of
errors
in
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
conducted
is
review.
first
of
all,
it
made
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
to
determine
if
the
evidence
was
clear
and
convincing
to
it,
not
whether
it
could
have
been
clear
and
convincing
to
the
united
states
district
court
judge
who
tried
the
case,
who
actually
heard
the
witnesses
testify,
who
was
able
to
observe
their
demeanor,
who
when
he
was
troubled
on
a
point
was
able
to
question
the
witness
and
clarify
that
point.
mr.
charles
hieken
we
have
set
that
out
in
our
reply
brief
i
think
beginning
on
page
4.
basically
we
suggest
that
the
thing
to
do
for
a
court
of
appeals
is
(1)
look
at
the
findings
of
fact
that
the
district
court
judge
found.
do
those
findings
of
fact
support
the
judgment?
basically--
mr.
charles
hieken
--in
terms--
mr.
charles
hieken
--no.
in
new
york
times
it
said
that
the
type
of
review
conducted
is
an
independent
examination
of
the
whole
record,
and
it
is
the
whole
record.
that
means--
mr.
charles
hieken
--if
it
did
that.
in
conducting
a
de
novo
review--
mr.
charles
hieken
--conducting
a
de
novo
review
in
effect
disregarding
the
findings
of
fact
is
not
correct,
and
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
it
did
not
examine
the
evidence
to
see
if
the
evidence
if
believed
by
the
district
court
could
support
the
findings
of
fact.
that
was
to
be
the
second
point
of
our
suggested
test.
after
you
find
the
findings
of
fact
that
he
found
support
the
judgment
you
want
to
examine
the
evidence
to
see
if
the
evidence
if
believed
by
the
district
court
judge
would
support
those
findings
and
the
district
court
judge
has
in
a
new
york
times
case
has
found
supported
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
then
you
can
affirm
the
judgment.
there
are--
mr.
charles
hieken
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor,
unless
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
the
court
of
appeals
should
read
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
absolutely.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
absolutely
not.
absolutely
wrong.
that
is
one
of
the
things--
mr.
charles
hieken
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
absolutely
bound
by
the
rulings
on
credibility
unless
the
findings
on
credibility
are
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
think
that
is
fair
to
say,
your
honor,
but
of
course
that
is
not
this
case--
mr.
charles
hieken
--i
know,
but
i
think
you
are
correct
on
that
point.
so--
mr.
charles
hieken
--that
is
correct.
it
is
not
necessary.
at
the
district
court
level
we
said
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
district
court
even
to
determine
whether
bose
was
a
public
figure
because
we
could
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
was
actual
malice.
i
was
going
on
to
the
third
point
which
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
not
make
de
novo
findings
of
fact
based
on
the
cold
printed
record,
and
the
fourth
point
which
really
has
already
been
brought
out
here
is
it
must
not
rely
on
testimony
which
the
district
court
judge
found
to
be
not
credible.
that
is
what--
mr.
charles
hieken
--i
think
that
we
are
asking
you
to
take
a
look
and
see
whether
the
court
of
appeals
did
its
job--
mr.
charles
hieken
--well,
i
think
there
is.
i
think--
mr.
charles
hieken
--what
it
is
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
not
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
of
rule
52(a),
and
we
submit
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
trilogy
of
cases
that
this
court
decided
in
1982
beginning
with
pullman-standard
v.
swint
and
followed
by
inwood
laboratories
or
ives
laboratories--
mr.
charles
hieken
--absolutely.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
hieken
not
credible?
mr.
charles
hieken
disregard
it.
you
have
to
disregard
it.
mr.
charles
hieken
oh,
you
can
read
it,
but
i
think
you
have--
mr.
charles
hieken
--yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
no.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
think
that
it
should
be
disregarded
when
it
is
not
credible.
now
another
mistake
that
the--
mr.
charles
hieken
--that
is
not
your
function.
mr.
charles
hieken
then
that
is--
mr.
charles
hieken
--no,
i
think
you
may
well
find
the
judge's
ruling
on
that
point
being
clearly
erroneous
under
that
circumstance,
but
anyway--
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
focus
on
another
important
area
where
the
court
of
appeals
missed
the
boat,
and
that
is
that
it
missed...
it
did
not
consider
this
court's
decision
in
the
cantrell
v.
forest
city
publishing
company
case
because
in
that
case
it
said
that
knowledge
of
the
author
of
falsity
is
attributable
to
the
publisher
when
the
author
is
performing
this
writing
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
cite
it
and
instead
focused
a
great
deal
of
attention
on
the
editorial
review
and
most
of
this
editorial
review
evidence
was
based
on
the
discredited
testimony
of
monte
florman.
so
it
is
our
position
that...
what
the
district
court
judge
did
is
said
i
do
not
have
to
look
at
what
the
editorial
review
policy
was
because
if
the
editorial
people
got
a
false
statement
from
respondent's
engineer
to
begin
with
all
they
could
do
was
trim
it
up
and
it
would
still
be
a
false
statement.
this
was
a
situation
of
not
a
music
critic.
this
was
a
statement
that
was
written
by
an
experienced
engineer
who
had
25
years'
of
experience
in
testing
loudspeakers.
there
is
the
important
aspect
in
review
also
for
the
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
witnesses,
and
what
is
our
device
for
testing
credibility
of
witnesses?
it
is
cross
examination.
this
court
has
regularly
held
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
cross
examination
of
witnesses.
but
what
is
the
measuring
stick
to
determine
the
impact
of
the
cross
examination?
the
measuring
device
that
we
use
in
the
trial
courts
is
the
district
court
judge
in
the
case
of
a
bench
trial
or
the
jury
in
the
case
of
a
jury
trial.
so
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
allowed
to
rely
on
testimony
that
was
destroyed
on
cross
examination
then
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
a
property
right
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
charles
hieken
they
said
they
were
not,
but
then
they
went
ahead
if
you
will
look
at
what
they
actually
did
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
they
do
not
mention
under
the
heading
"review"
of
the
impact
of
the
testimony
of
seligson
of
what
he
knew.
he
testified
as
to
what
he
actually
heard,
and
he
used
language
of
such
a
nature
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
sounds
that
moved
back
and
forth
between
left
and
right
loudspeaker
which
was
normal
stereo
sound
and
this
bizarre
and
grotesque
sound
that
was
reported
in
the
article
of
instruments
that
tended
to
wander
about
the
other
areas
of
the
room
which
the
district
court
judge
found
to
be
bizarre
and
grotesque.
the
test
that
we
have
proposed
here
and
it
is
in
the
reply
brief
and
i
have
mentioned
it
is
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
rule
52(a)
with
the
first
amendment,
with
the
fifth
amendment.
it
promotes
the
confidence
of
litigants
in
our
judicial
system.
it
reduces
appeals.
it
allows
courts
of
appeal
to
spend
their
time
on
ruling
on
questions
of
law
so
that
they
can
give
guidance
to
us
lawyers,
and
we
can
advise
our
clients
so
as
to
stay
out
of
litigation.
that
is,
it
promotes
certainty
in
our
pre-litigation
conduct.
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
lie,
and
that
is
what
consumers
union
has
done
here.
mr.
charles
hieken
may
i
comment
on
it
after
in
my
rebuttal
period
because
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
you
do
not
mind.
mr.
charles
hieken
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
if,
your
honor,
please.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
about
the
baumgartner
case
which
basically
deals
with
an
ultimate
finding
of
fact
there
which
is
really
a
conclusion
of
law
or
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
and,
of
course,
the
court
can
always
look
at
the
evidence
to
see
if
there
is
enough
evidence
to
be
clear
and
convincing
to
the
trier
of
fact.
that
is
a
question
of
law.
whether
the
trial
court
found
it
to
be
clear
and
convincing
is
a
question
of
fact.
in
the
woodby
case
at
385
u.s.
276
on
page
367
this
court
pointed
out
there
is
an
elementary
but
crucial
difference
between
burden
of
proof
and
scope
of
review
and
that
is,
of
course,
commonplace
in
the
law.
it
said
the
difference
is
most
graphically
illustrated
in
a
criminal
case.
there
the
prosecution
must
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
if
the
correct
burden
of
proof
was
imposed
at
the
trial
judicial
review
is
generally
limited
to
ascertaining
whether
the
evidence
relied
upon
by
the
trier
of
fact
was
of
sufficient
quality
and
substantiality
to
support
the
rationality
of
the
judgment.
in
other
words,
an
appellate
court
in
a
criminal
case
ordinarily
does
not
ask
itself
whether
it
believes
that
the
evidence
at
the
trial
established
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
whether
the
judgment
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
we
submit
that
the
same
type
of
review
is
appropriate
here
to
determine
whether
the
trial
court
could
find
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
statement
was
actually
false.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
characterization
of
the
record
by
the
respondent
here,
but
i
believe
that
we
have
adequately
covered
it
in
our
reply
brief.
i
would
like
really
to
kind
of
conclude
here
with
what
i
feel
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
this
case,
the
proper
allocation
of
business
in
the
courts,
the
trial
courts
into
appellate
courts.
the
trial
courts'
primary
function
is
the
finding
of
facts.
the
appellate
courts'
primary
function
is
rulings
of
law
to
check
what
the
trial
court
did
to
make
sure
that
rulings
of
law
have
been
followed.
if
appellate
courts
are
going
to
independently
reexamine
facts
then
an
attorney
who
has
lost
a
case
has
no
alternative
but
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
hope
that
he
is
going
to
get
a
new
trial
on
the
facts
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
that
is
inappropriate.
it
is
not
conducive
to
justice
and
would
result
in
more
appeals
and
less
justice.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
here,
the
judgment
of
liability
of
the
trial
court
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
instructed
to
review
the
question
of
damages
in
accordance
with
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
thank
you.
