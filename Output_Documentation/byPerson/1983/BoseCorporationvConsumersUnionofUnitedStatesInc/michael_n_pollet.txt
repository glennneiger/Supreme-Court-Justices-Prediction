mr.
michael
n.
pollet
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
thirteen
years
after
publication
of
the
disputed
article
and
after
the
district
court
had
explicitly
rejected
numerous
charges
of
product
disparagement
and
bias
against
consumers
union
and
had
upheld
cu's
good
faith
and
integrity
against
every
attack
leveled
against
it
this
dispute
centers
around
the
alleged
slip
of
a
single
preposition,
the
word
"about"
as
expressed
by
consumers
union
in
giving
its
subjective
impression
of
instruments
heard
through
these
novel,
unique
and
unconventional
loudspeakers.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
we
do
indeed
challenge
that.
we
think
when
properly
and
fairly
read
that
it
is
not
disparaging.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
but
i
do
believe--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--well,
i
do
believe
we
raised
that
point
in
the
course
of
our
argument
in
the
petition
although
not
as
a
separate
point.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
right.
we
believe
properly
read
fairly
not--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--yes.
we
would
welcome
such
an
opportunity
and
a
look
at
the
article
in
its
proper
context.
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--oh,
yes,
very
clearly.
this
trivial
difference
between
words
found
actionable
and
not
accentuates
the
substantial
risks
which
even
a
responsible
publisher
can
face
in
expressing
subjective
judgments
even
in
the
form
of
mild
criticism.
we
respectfully
submit
that
reversal
was
proper
and
under
any
standard
of
appellate
review.
the
issues
at
stake
here
are
important
and
significant.
they
are
whether
we
remain
committed
to
the
preservation
of
first
amendment
principles
woven
into
defamation
law
in
times
v.
sullivan.
as
the
district
court
ruling
so
graphically
demonstrates
those
protections
afforded
to
the
press
in
a
public
figure
libel
suit
that
the
plaintiff
show
falsity
and
show
with
convincing
clarity
that
the
publisher
knowingly
lied
or
in
fact
had
serious
doubts
of
accuracy
are
fragile
indeed
and
subject
to
facile
or
distorted
fact
finding.
without
the
continued
ability
of
our
appellate
courts
to
exercise
independent
constitutional
judgment
to
determine
for
themselves
whether
constitutional
rules
here
have
been
constitutionally
applied
to
undisputed
facts,
the
breathing
space
which
this
court
has
held
necessary
if
the
freedoms
of
speech
are
to
survive
will
be
lost.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
it
does
not
apply
in
any
event
to
the
ultimate
fact,
the
question
of
law--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--if
it
applies
at
all
it
would
apply
only
to
historical
facts.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
are
we
talking
in
the
context
of
a
defamation
suit?
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
because
that
is
the
ultimate
conclusion
drawn
from
historical
facts.
i
do
not
understand
that
as
being
an
historical
fact--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--no,
because
i
believe
that
this
court
recently
held
in
connick
v.
meyers
just
this
past
april
that
the
inquiry
into
the
protected
status
of
speech
is
a
matter
of
law
and
not
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
it
does
not
apply
at
all
when
we
are--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--that
is
right.
this
court
has
made
that
crystal
clear.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
with
all
due
deference,
justice
rehnquist,
the
facts
in
this
case
as
you
have
posed
them
are
not
as
they
occurred.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
plainly
and
clearly
articulated
his
reason,
his
sole
rationale
for
the
finding
of
so-called
incredibility
with
was
that
the
author
was
too
intelligent
to
have
made
an
honest
mistake.
that
is
not
a
credibility
finding.
that
is
an
erroneous
application
of
law.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
the
publisher
before
the
court
here
is
consumers
union
of
united
states.
it
is
the
nation's
leading
and
most
prestigious
not-for-profit
testing
organization.
for
more
than
47
years
it
has
published
a
monthly
magazine
"consumer
reports".
in
may
of
1970
consumers
union
included
in
a
survey
of
24
loudspeaker
models
a
seven
paragraph
evaluation
of
the
unique,
unconventional
bose
model
901
loudspeaker
system.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
your
honor,
the
facts
in
this
case
is
not
show
great
damage.
within
a
year
or
so
after
publication
of
the
article
the
bose
901
according
to
the
record
was
either
first
or
second
in
total
dollar
volume
sales
in
the
country.
thus,
if
consumers
union
may
have
a
great
effect
it
certainly
was
not
a
negative
effect
in
this
case.
indeed,
the
review
was
in
part
complimentary
and
in
part
cautionary.
it
attempted
to
put
into
words
the
author's
aesthetic
perception
of
a
uniquely
subjective
impression
of
an
amorphus
phenomenon
that
all
parties
including
the
court
had
difficulty
in
describing
with
precision.
as
noted
the
review's
evaluation
opened
with
praise
of
the
plaintiff's
product.
it
termed
the
bose
901
considerably
more
spacious
and
reverberant
than
conventional
speakers.
it
said
that
the
effect
was
rather
dramatic
and
was
felt
from
any
listening
position.
after
judging
various
qualities
of
the
bose
system
indeed
the
article
concluded
not
by
recommending
against
purchase
of
the
bose
but
by
directly
telling
its
readers
we
think
the
bose
system
is
so
unusual
that
a
prospective
buyer
must
listen
to
it
and
judge
it
for
himself.
the
article
in
addition
to
the
concededly
complimentary
findings
and
the
encouragement
to
try
the
product
noted
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
location
of
the
instruments
with
the
bose
than
with
standard
speaker
systems.
that
is
a
finding
that
was
not
found
false
in
the
district
court.
in
specifying
what
it
meant
about
the
localization
problems
the
review
went
on
to
say
in
a
single
sentence
containing
the
only
phrase
found
actionable
by
the
district
court
"worse
individual
instruments
heard
through
the
bose
systems
seem
to
grow
to
gigantic
proportions
and
tended
to
wander
about
the
room.
"
the
immediately
following
sentence
the
author
put
both
size
and
location
of
the
described
receptions
into
context.
it
was
written,
"for
instance
a
violin
appeared
to
be
10
feet
wide
and
a
piano
stretched
from
wall
to
wall.
"
then
the
author
minimized
his
judgments
by
stating
"with
orchestral
music
such
effects
seem
inconsequential,
but
we
think
they
might
become
annoying
when
listening
to
soloists.
"
the
district
court
found
defamation,
disparagement
only
by
breaking
the
sentence
in
two,
by
parsing
it
artificially.
that
portion
of
the
sentence
which
referred
to
"instruments
seeming
to
grow
to
gigantic
proportions.
"
was
held
not
proven
false.
the
court
then
isolated
and
wrenched
from
its
context
the
remainder
of
the
phrase
that
"instruments
tended
to
wander
about
the
room.
"
as
noted
the
judge
found
that
subjective
perception
was
better
expressed
as
such
which
tended
to
wander
about
or
along
the
wall
rather
than
about
the
room.
it
ignored
the
word
"tended"
in
the
disputed
phrase
itself.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
following
sentence
which
placed
the
effects
along
the
wall
by
saying
that
sentence
would
not
thus
be
understood
by
any
reasonable
reader,
and
the
phrase
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
attribute
bizarre
and
grotesque
effects
to
the
product
despite
the
plain
absence
of
any
such
words
in
the
article
and
the
plain
language
in
the
article
that
the
effects
were
inconsequential
with
orchestral
music
and
only
might
become
annoying
when
listening
to
soloists.
having
found
the
disputed
phrase
to
be
false
the
court
disregarded
the
author's
testimony
to
his
good
faith
belief
that
the
words
accurately
described
what
he
had
just
seen.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
think
falsity
is
at
least
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
if
not
a
pure
question
of
law.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
falsehood?
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
because
again
it
implies
and
implicates
first
amendment
freedoms,
the
right
to
free
speech
and
free
press.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
because
as
justice
frankfurter
noted
in
the
watts
case
an
issue
of
fact
is
a
code
of
many
colors.
when
an
issue
involves
a
conclusion
drawn
from
uncontroverted
happenings
and
that
conclusion
implicates
fundamental
freedoms
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
and
not
to
be
treated
as
an
ordinary
fact
subject
to
the
same
limitations
that
more
pedestrian
fact
finding
might
involve.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
falsehood?
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
each
case
in
this
court
that
has
considered
libel
judgments
have
done
it
on
the
issue
of
actual
malice
i
believe,
justice
rehnquist.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
direct
authority
on
the
issue
of
falsehood.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
may
be
a
historical
fact,
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
is
not
a
historical
fact
is
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
actual
malice.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
the
finding--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--i
believe
that
is
an
issue
of
law
that
that
is
a
legal
standards
which
must
be
measured
by--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--yes,
i
believe
you
can
by
reading
the
article.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
sure.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no.
although
the
court
of
appeals
expressed
doubt
as
to
whether
the
statement
was
false
for
the
purposes
of
its
opinion
it
assumed
by
the
statement
it
was
factual
and
that
it
was
false.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
and
that
it
was...
no,
it
did
state
separately.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
that
is
correct
although--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
you
do.
but
that
it
is
that
standard--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--well,
i
think
for
these
purposes
they
are
both
the
same
thing
for
the
purposes
of
independent
appellate
review.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
right.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
it
is
law.
it
is
law
or
it
is
an
ultimate
fact
in
which
a
standard
of
constitutionality--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--no.
malice
is
a
legal
construct
derived
specifically
from
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
it
is
also
defined
as
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
the
point,
your
honor,
that
you
cannot
separate
the
constitutional
standard
from
the
finding
of
fact,
and
the
footnote
in
new
york
times
in
dismissing
the
seventh
amendment
arguments
against
independent
appellate
review
pointed
out
when
a
federal
question,
a
constitutional
right
is
so
intermingled
with
a
finding
of
fact
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
pass
on
the
legal
question
to
analyze
the
facts
that
the
court
must
look
at
the
issue
independently.
that
is
the--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--yes.
i
think
it
applies
more
so
to
federal
courts
because
this
court's
and
appellate
courts'
corrective
authority
over
the
lower
federal
courts
is
larger
and
less
restrictive
than
it
is
with
respect
to
state
courts
or
state
court
juries.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
do
not
know
if
we
have
to
go
that
far
certainly
not
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
in
this
case
the
precedents
in
this
court
are
clear
with
respect
to
the
court's
duty,
mandate
as
to
how
it
shall
look
at
the
conclusion
of
the
lower
court.
it
must
do
so
independently
because
of
the
nature
of
the
right
involved,
and
it
is
particularly
apposite
and
appropriate
here
because
of
the
high
nature
of
the
standard
of
proof
that
it
be
clear
and
convincing.
if
i
might
just
for
a
few
moments,
your
honors,
turn
to
what
we
consider
and
what
we
have
described
as
the
undisputed
established
on-record
evidence
in
this
case
because
we
believe
that
when
looked
at
fairly
and
properly
and
not
mischaracterized
that
evidence
shows
that
the
actual
malice
finding
was
not
only
without
support
but
it
was
in
contradiction
to
the
record
evidence.
looked
at
it
is
plain
that
prior
to
publication
consumers
union
carried
out
a
lengthy,
original,
extensive
research
and
editorial
practices,
that
it
contained
numerous
checks
for
review
and
accuracy,
that
the
research
and
editing
process
were
adhered
to
closely.
there
was
no
departure
from
reasonable
journalism
standards.
the
authors
were
experienced
and
expert
in
loudspeaker
testing.
mr.
seligson
has
25
years'
of
experience.
he
is
highly
respected.
he
has
extensive
educational
engineering
and
journalistic
background.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
think
you
have
the
same
obligation
to
make
an
independent
constitutional
judgment
to
accept
the
facts
in
the
record
which
were
admitted,
established
or
undisputed
and
independently
to
determine
for
yourself
whether
those
facts
as
found
can
constitutionally
support
an
actual
malice
finding.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
it
is
not
a
de
novo
review
of
the
record
in
the
sense
that
the
court
is
going
to
make
independent
fact
finding,
find
new
facts
or--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
because
as
this
court
has
stated
that
is
its
obligation
in
such
cases,
not
merely
to
elaborate
constitutional
principles
but
to
make
sure
that
they
do
not
intrude
upon
the
first
amendment--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
think
if
there
is
any
difference
that
this
court
is
even
freer
in
such
a
case.
rule
52
as
noted
is
a
rule
of
federal
civil
procedure,
and
it
is
not
of
the
same
magnitude
and
order
as
the
constitution.
i
think
it
would
be
an
anomolous
situation
if
this
court
had
greater
authority
to
review
facts
found
in
a
state
court
than
it
did
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unconstitutional
because
i
do
not
believe
it
applies,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
rule
52
would--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
--all
findings
of
fact
except
questions
of
law
which
actual
malice
is
or
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
implicating
a
constitutional
standard
which
this
also
is.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
in
this
case
i
believe
not
because
this
is
not
a
defamation
case,
a
libel
suit
brought
by
an
individual
plaintiff
where
there
may
be
although
i
state
this
only
arguendo
a
more
balanced
weighing
of
the
rights
involved,
the
reputation
of
an
individual
person
against
the
rights
of
freedom
of
expression.
in
this
case
this
is
a
product
disparagement
case
where
the
only
interest
of
the
plaintiff
involved
is
the
interest
of
the
reputation
of
its
product,
an
interest
which
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
at
the
center
of
any
decent
system
of
ordered
liberty.
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
back
to
the
record
because
the
record
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
the
district
court
found
the
consumers
union
acted
in
good
faith,
that
it
had
no
subjective
awareness
of
falsity.
every
attack
on
good
faith
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
these
included
testimony
by
the
plaintiff
and
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
which
took
up
a
lengthy
substantial
portion
of
the
trial
contending
that
the
author
was
biased
against
the
bose
because
of
a
competing
patent
which
the
author
held.
the
district
court
specifically
on
the
basis
of
mr.
seligson's
demeanor
ruled
out
any
bad
faith
on
that
ground.
the
district
court
likewise
ruled
out
again
on
the
basis
of
seligson's
testimony
the
charge
made
by
the
petitioner
that
he
had
fabricated
other
tests.
the
petitioner
also
charged
that
consumers
union
was
biased
towards
low
priced
products.
the
district
court
again
ruled
that
out.
indeed
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
when
the
author
had
the
opportunity
to
exercise
subjective
judgment
in
rating
the
bose
product
he
upgraded
the
rating
in
the
important
area
of
sound
quality
so
that
everything
in
the
record
is
quite
plain
that
there
was
no
bad
faith.
the
district
court
in
its
finding
of
actual
malice
did
not
point
to
any
evidence,
objective
or
subjective,
from
which
actual
malice
could
be
either
inferred
directly
or
found
directly.
it
did
so
and
it
found
actual
malice
only
as
a
result
of
an
erroneous
application
of
a
rule
of
law.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
pullman-standard
v.
swint
if
the
district
court's
findings
rest
on
erroneous
view
of
law
they
may
be
set
aside
on
that
basis
and
are
not
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
rule
52.
the
record
is
again
clear.
the
district
court
opinion
is
plain
that
the
only
reason
for
finding
actual
malice,
the
only
reason
articulated
by
the
district
judge
was
that
the
author
was
too
intelligent
to
have
made
an
honest
mistake.
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
record,
nothing
else
relied
upon
by
the
district
court
for
its
finding.
it
was
that
and
that
alone.
we
believe
that
in
doing
so
the
district
court
committed
plain
legal
error.
it
inferred
malice
from
falsity
and
applied
an
objective
reasonable
person
standard
which
has
been
forbidden
by
this
court
specifically
in
garrison
v.
louisiana
where
the
lower
court,
the
state
court,
there
had
found
actual
malice
because
it
said
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
defendant
could
have
had
a
reasonable
belief
which
could
be
defined
as
an
honest
belief
that
not
one
but
all
eight
of
these
judges
were
guilty
of
what
he
charged
them
with.
this
court
rejected
that
analysis
stating
that
this
is
not
a
holding
applying
the
new
york
times
test.
the
reasonable
belief
standard
applied
by
a
trial
judge
is
not
the
same
as
the
wreckless
disregard
of
truth
standard.
the
district
court's
holding
if
allowed
to
stand
would
in
fact
turn
new
york
times
on
its
head.
it
would
effectively
impose
strict
liability
upon
responsible
conscientious
publishers
such
as
consumers
union
with
hardworking,
caring,
intelligent
writers
and
editors.
it
would
render
their
carefully
constructed
editorial
procedures
designed
to
achieve
accuracy
irrelevant
and
meaningless.
indeed,
by
virtue
of
those
very
procedures
by
virtue
of
the
high
standards
of
journalism
which
they
embody
they
would
be
ruled
incapable
of
making
an
honest
mistake
and
given
no
breathing
space
for
honest
error.
their
words
would
be
placed
in
the
same
legal
category
as
which
are
placed
the
use
of
explosives,
the
harboring
of
dangerous
animals
and
forms
of
product
liability.
a
system
of
freed
of
expression
will
surely
not
tolerate
such
a
result.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
this
erroneous
misapplication
of
the
law
and
faulted
the
district
court
for
its
holding
that
to
find
actual
malice
in
this
case
would
be
to
interpret
that
concept
to
require
little
more
than
proof
of
falsity.
we
believe
that
that
holding
is
eminently
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
so.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
as
dictum
as
an
aside
they
did
reach
it.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
they
did.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
properly.
it
did
not
engage
in
de
novo
fact
finding.
its
role
was
limited
solely
to
independently
weighing
the
facts
and
determining
whether
as
applied
to
the
constitution
they
met
the
clear
and
convincing
proof
standard.
it
seems
to
us
that
nothing
could
be
more
appropriate
for
a
federal
appellate
court
or
this
court
to
determine
on
undisputed
facts
what
the
constitution
means.
we
believe
that
even
more
so
than
the
issue
of
fraud
in
the
denaturalization
proceedings
before
justice
frankfurter
in
the
baumgartner
case
that
actual
malice
is
a
finding
which
cannot
escape
broadly
social
judgments
which
is
inextricably
enmeshed
with
important
fundamental
rights,
and
as
in
baumgartner
the
burden
of
proof
placed
upon
a
plaintiff
is
to
establish
its
case
with
convincing
clarity.
this
constitutional
requirement
would
be
forfeit
if
a
court
of
appeals
could
not
exercise
independent
judgment.
the
net
result
would
become
that
in
first
amendment
cases
in
public
figure
defamation
cases
for
all
practical
purposes
the
district
courts
finding
on
both
factual
and
legal
components
would
become
impervious
to
review.
that
surely
is
not
the
intention.
we
believe
that
the
addington
case
is
quite
pertinent
here.
as
pointed
out
there
the
function
of
the
legal
process
is
to
minimize
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
decision
by
requiring
proof
of
more
than
a
mere
preponderance
by
calling
upon
a
public
figure
libel
plaintiff
to
establish
actual
malice
with
convincing
clarity.
the
first
amendment
has
allocated
the
risk
of
error
between
the
litigants.
it
is
plainly
recognized
that
the
free
speech
and
press
rights
at
stake
are
more
substantial
than
the
loss
of
money.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
thank
you.
