unknown
speaker
mr.
hieken.
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
disparaging
nature
of
the
language
which
you
just
referred
to
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
in
your
client's
favor
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
sound
like
you
are
on
stereo.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you...
what
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals'
job
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
new
york
times
standard
does
not
require
any
different
review
of
factual
findings
than
in
any
other
kind
of
case?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
they
said
this
is
a
first
amendment
case
under
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
we
have
a
special
duty
to
look
at
the
record
more
closely
than
we
normally
would.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
did
independently
examine
the
whole
record
it
did
the
right
thing
here.
unknown
speaker
that
part
was
right.
unknown
speaker
let
me
try.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
should
have
been
bound
by
the
findings
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
he
should
not
read
the
record?
unknown
speaker
they
can
set
them
aside
if
they
found
them
clearly
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
think
they
can
set
them
aside
by
relying
on
testimony
from
a
witness
that
the
district
court
said
he
did
not
believe.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
at
least
bound
by
if
they
can
tell
by
the
district
court's
rulings
on
credibility.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
tell
that?
unknown
speaker
if
the
judge
says
i
think
you
are
lying--
unknown
speaker
--you
do
not
make
findings
on
credibility.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
does
not
say
i
disbelieve
this
witnesses
because
of
factors
a,
b,
c,
d.
but
if
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
is
deposition
testimony
i
suppose
the
district
judge
has
not
got
any
leverage
on
the
court
of
appeals
then.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
know
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
not
asking
us
to
cut
back
on
the
new
york
times?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
because
i
am
really
not
sure.
are
you
asking
us
to
cite
any
novel
proposition
of
law
or
are
you
just
basically
asking
us
to
take
a
good
hard
look
at
the
record
here
and
be
sure
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
its
job
correctly?
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
is
not
any
question
of
law
of
any
particular
significance
at
stake.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is,
what
is
it?
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
of
that
is
you
say
that,
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have,
should
not
have
purported
to
make
de
novo
findings.
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
do
with
the
testimony
of
the
witness
that
the
judge
said
was
incredible?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
can
we
read
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
we
cannot
do
anything
about
it?
unknown
speaker
but
read
it.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
we
think
it
is
credible?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
suppose
the
testimony
of
the
witness
says
it
is
now
ten
minutes
past
two
and
the
judge
said
that
is
incredible.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
recognize
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
said
they
were
not
reviewing
credibility
determinations.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
comment
on
the
baumgartner
case?
i
do
not
believe
you
cited
it.
it
is
cited
extensively
by
your
opposition.
unknown
speaker
i
do
want
to
hear
from
you
on
it
because
i
find
nothing
in
your
briefs
about
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollet,
i
did
not
understand
you
to
challenge
in
your
brief
the
finding
of
the
district
court
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
cu's
article
was
in
fact
disparaging.
are
you
challenging
it
now?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
cross
petition.
unknown
speaker
we
judged
this
case
on
the
basis
that
it
was
disparaging.
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
on
the
proposition
if
you
cannot
sustain
your
judgment
on
the
ground
given
maybe
you
can
in
this
one.
unknown
speaker
we
agree
with
your
adversary
on
the
other
point.
do
you
want
us
then
to
turn
to
whether
or
not
this
was
disparaging?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
argued
below
that
it
was
not
disparaging.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
submission
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
just
does
not
apply
in
a
first
amendment
case?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
does
it
apply
at
all.
unknown
speaker
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment...
you
probably
will
not
agree
with
it,
but
let's
just
assume
that
the
question
of
knowledge
is
a
historical
fact.
would
you
say
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
would
apply
to
that?
unknown
speaker
where
the
claim
is
that
the
person
who
wrote
the
article
or
made
the
defamatory
statement
knew
that
it
was
false,
just
knew.
let's
assume
that
is
a
historical
fact.
would
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
apply
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
you
would
think
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
applied
to
it.
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
just
does
not
apply
at
all.
unknown
speaker
in
the
first
amendment
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
principle
of
the
first
amendment
suggests
that
it
is
desirable
to
allow
a
court
of
appeals
such
as
it
did
in
this
case
to
simply
second-guess
a
trial
judge's
finding
that
a
witness
whom
the
trial
judge
heard
testify
was
not
credible?
unknown
speaker
each
is
entitled
to
his
own
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i
supposed
by
the
same
token
if
it
is
such
an
authoritative
voice
it
is
capable
of
inflicting
great
damage.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
falsity
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
or
is
it
a
historical
fact
or
is
it
just
a
straight
question
of
law?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
have
any
legal
implications
rather
than
factual
implications?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
why
does
that
convert
something
that
would
otherwise
is
a
factual
question
into
a
legal
question?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
that
statement?
what
case
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
a
statement
that
a
certain
object
is
red
and
somebody
else
claims
it
is
black
and
the
district
judge
listens
to
all
the
witnesses
and
finds
that
the
object
is
black.
it
was
not
red
at
all.
is
that
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
to
find
that
an
assertion
that
the
object
is
red
is
false?
isn't
that
a
historical
fact?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
issue
of
disparagement,
the
holding
that
this
is
a
disparaging
statement?
what
is
that?
is
that
an
issue
of
law
or
fact?
unknown
speaker
can
we
decide
whether
or
not
this
was
disparaging
without
addressing
the
question
of
what
the
nature
of
the
review
may
be?
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
it
was
not
disparaging
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
case
without
having
to
address
the
other
issue?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
another
reason
you
say
to
affirm?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
an
issue
that
would
be
involved
if
we
just
dealt
with
the
issues
that
were
presented
on
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
the
actual
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
limited
to
the
actual
malice
issue,
that
there
had
been
a
failure
of
proof
on
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
so
they
did
not
really
reach
the
question
of
whether
it
was
fact
or
mixed
question
on
falsity
or
any
of
these
other
points?
unknown
speaker
and
that
it
was
disparaging.
unknown
speaker
it
agreed
that
it
was
disparaging?
unknown
speaker
but
their
holding
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
fact
or
mixed
question
related
solely
to
the
malice
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
there
two
ways
of
finding
malice?
one
is
to
find
that
there
was
a
knowing
falsehood
and
the
other
is
that
there
is
a
wreckless
disregard
for
truth.
unknown
speaker
malice
is
just
a
code
word
for
either
one
of
those.
if
you
find
that
knowing
falsehood
you
have
satisfied
the
burden
of
proof
under
new
york
times,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
really
ought
to
look
behind
what
the
particular
finding
is.
wreckless
disregard
for
truth
might
be
one
thing
but
knowing
falsehood
is
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
is
your
submission.
fact
or
law?
unknown
speaker
fact
or
law
as
justice
white
has
just
pointed
out.
unknown
speaker
which
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
accept
his
translation
if
it
is
that
that
malice
is
just
a
code
word
describing
either
one
of
those
two
concepts?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
malice
is
defined
in
new
york
times
as
either
knowing
falsehood
or
wreckless
disregard.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
but
it
is
not
separate
from
knowledge
or
wreckless
disregard.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
applies
to
federal
courts
as
well
where
you
have
this
rule
52?
unknown
speaker
the
way
you
put
it
you
would
think
that
the
rule
you
are
talking
about
applies
whenever
there
is
any
constitutional
issue
involved,
whenever
there
is
an
issue
of
so-called
constitutional
fact.
rule
52
is
just
beside
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
way
you
put
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollet,
may
i
ask
a
question
that
i
think
goes
to
this
part
of
your
argument?
your
legal
position
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
look
more
closely
at
the
record
than
in
a
normal
case
here.
now
when
we
are
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
do
we
have
the
same
obligation
to
make
a
rather
fresh
examination
of
the
record
so
we
have
to
have
the
same
detailed
understanding
of
the
nuances
of
the
facts
that
we
expect
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
decide
it?
unknown
speaker
so
we
need
three
de
novo
reviews
of
this
record
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
we
should
do
whatever
the
court
of
appeals
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
whatever
they
did
we
can
do
and
should
do.
unknown
speaker
if
they
were
remiss
then
we
should
do
the
job
over.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
said
that,
of
course,
in
new
york
times
but
that
was
in
the
context
of
a
review
of
a
state
supreme
court
decision
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
there
is
any
difference
when
it
comes
as
this
one
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
happens
to
then
be
the
rule
52.
it
is
the
position
of
a
statue.
unless
it
is
unconstitutional
it
binds
us
with
respect
to
the
facts.
do
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional,
rule
52,
in
a
first
amendment
case?
unknown
speaker
it
does
on
its
face.
it
applies
to
all
fact
finding.
unknown
speaker
or
so-called
ultimate
fact?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
the
appellate
court's
job
is
the
same
regardless
of
whether
the
first
amendment
right
was
sustained
or
rejected
in
the
trial
court?
if
you
had
won
in
the
trial
court
instead
of
losing
would
your
opponent
have
been
entitled
to
the
same
broad
review
that
you
claim
to
be
entitled
to?
unknown
speaker
if
we
disagree
with
you
would
the
issue
of
falsity
be
open
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
they
just
assumed.
they
did
not--
unknown
speaker
--they
did
not...
but
they
did
reach
the
defamatory
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
