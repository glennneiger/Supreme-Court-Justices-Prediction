ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
summary
judgment
from
a
suit
against
a
guard
himself
who
conducted
what
has
been
described
as
a
ransacking
search
of
my
client's
locker
and
destruction
of
his
property
for
harassment
purposes.
it
presents
two
questions.
first,
whether
there
is
now
to
be
drawn
around
prison
walls
an
iron
curtain
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
do
not
believe
that
under
the
analysis
of
search
and
seizures
and
prisons
that
a
warrant
is
required,
but
i
think
we
still
might
focus
on
the
justification.
if
somebody
went
in
to
search
to
harass
i
think
it
would
still
be
a
harassing
search
and
seizure--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--the
pistol?
i
think
if
it
violated
the
fourth
amendment
as
the
law
stands
now
it
would
not
be
admissible
against
him.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
yes,
your
honor.
it
could
be
confiscated.
obviously
it
could
be,
but--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
all
of
that
would
be
analyzed
the
same.
if
the
search
is
a
legitimate
search,
and
that
is
quite
broad
in
a
prison
context.
you
can
search
randomly
if
that
is
your
pattern
in
the
prison.
you
can
search
an
individual
if
you
have
a
particular
suspicion,
and
under
either
of
those
circumstances
if
you
find
the
heroin,
if
you
find
the
gun
they
are,
of
course,
admissible
because
that
is
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure
under
prison
circumstances.
but
if
you
search
to
harass
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
harass
then
you
have
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
and
therefore
the
suppression
issues
would
apply.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
a
search
for
no
legitimate
purpose
at
all.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that
is
correct.
not
expecting
to
find,
not
looking
for
contraband,
not
even
doing
this
as
a
deterrent.
i
think
prisons
would
have
the
right
to
have
a
search
policy
as
a
deterrent,
random
searches,
and
i
believe
the
fourth
circuit
recognized
that
and
said
that
you
could
have
a
system
of
random
cell
searches
but
there
must
be
a
system
pursuant
to
which
the
individual
is
being
searched.
if
you
did
it--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
believe
if
there
is
no
legitimate
purpose
it
would
be
analyzed
as
unreasonable,
and
i
think
in
a
prison
situation
we
have
obviously
a
very
broad
standard
of
reasonableness.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
be
the
same.
harrassing
as
i
use
it
means
not
for
a
legitimate
purpose.
if
you
have
a
suspicion
that
someone
has
contraband
even
if
you
are
lethally
searching
him
for
that
contraband
that
is
not
for
a
harassment
purpose.
the
way
i
am
using
it
is
an
abusive
purpose.
you
are
picking
on
someone
in
your
custody.
you
are
not
doing
it
for
any
legitimate
prison
security
or
administrative
purpose.
that
is
what
we
have
on
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
absolutely.
in
fact
the
question
presented
is
simply
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies
within
prison,
and
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
held.
the
fourth
circuit
did
proceed
to
address
such
issues
as
burden
of
proof
and,
of
course,
petitioner
has
argued
that
that
has
been
shifted
and
shifted
incorrectly.
i
read
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
differently,
and
i
read
it
to
be
that
a
prisoner
must
allege
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
which
is
going
to
be
a
very
small
range
of
searches
or
seizures
in
a
prison
setting
that
will
be
unreasonable.
once
he
has
alleged
that
then
the
state
can
justify
it
if
they
do
honestly
justify
it
by
saying
that
we
have
a
pattern
of
random
searches
or
i
had
a
particular
suspicion
about
this
individual.
but
to
pick
on
the
person,
to
do
it
abusively
for
only
the
purpose
of
harassment
would
be
i
think
a
classic
case
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
and
perhaps
one
of
the
only
cases
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
within
a
prison
setting.
i
believe
that
is
why
petitioner
is
retreated
to
a
bright
line
request
for
this
court.
i
certainly
suspect
that
petitioner
is
not
in
a
position
to
request
a
bright
line
because
petitioner
knew
that
what
petitioner
was
doing
was
wrong,
but
even
if
this
court
felt
that
a
bright
line
was
needed
i
can
suggest
another
line
that
i
think
is
equally
bright
in
a
prison
setting
which
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
search
and
seize
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
i
think
that
petitioner's
position
on
the
fourth
amendment
is
unwarranted.
it
is
unsound,
and
i
think
that
for
that
reason
the
court
should
decline
the
invitation
to
sweep
away
this
constitutional
right
any
more
broadly
than
necessary.
again,
the
only
question
that
has
been
framed
for
this
court
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
prisons,
and
indeed
it
should
even
though
that
may
only
provide
limited
protection
to
a
prisoner.
with
regard
to
the
second
question
in
this
case,
that
is,
the
due
process
issue
and
the
question
of
whether
a
due
process
violation,
whether
an
intentional
abusive
deprivation
can
ever
violate
the
due
process
clause
when
it
violates
a
state's
own
laws
which
is
to
say
when
a
state--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
my
cross
petition.
the
fourth
amendment
issue
was
raised
in
the
original
petition
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
and
i
am
addressing
now
the
issue
i
raised
which
is
the
due
process,
whether
an
intentional,
abusive
deprivation
is
totally
unprotected
by
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
petitioner
who
alleged
that
it
does
not
has
totally
missed
a
major
distinction
in
this
case
which
is
a
distinction
between
suits
against
higher
supervisory
officials
or
otherwise
against
general
policies
or
procedures
and
challenges
directly
to
individuals
who
themselves
have
abused.
in
the
former
case
understandably
the
analysis
is
going
to
turn
on
whether
a
wrongful
deprivation
was
pursuant
to
that
policy
or
was
instead
a
random
act
not
authorized
by
the
procedure,
a
fluke,
or
even
an
abuse
under
a
procedure
where
the
risk
of
abuse
is
low
as
in
ingraham.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
and
that
analysis
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
this
case
is
a
challenge
directly
to
the
individual
who
abused,
and
in
that
sense
this
case
is
governed
by
screws
v.
united
states
and
monroe
v.
pape.
both
of
those
cases
involved
challenges
directly
to
the
officials
who
abused,
not
to
supervisory
officials.
in
both
of
those
cases
the
court
said
that
it
is
no
defense
that
the
act
is
unauthorized.
it
is
no
defense
that
it
is
unauthorized
even
if
that
means
that
a
state
then
provides
remedies
and
that,
therefore,
one
might
be
able
to
receive
compensation
in
state
courts.
this
was
rejected
in
screws
v.
united
states
where
the
court
cleanly
held
under
a
challenge
to
the
individual
official
that
that
intentional
wrongful
deprivation
violated
the
due
process
clause
immediately
and
state
court
remedies
are
completely
and
totally
irrelevant.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
there
is
a
difference.
that
was
a
criminal
prosecution
among--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that
was
a
life
deprivation.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
think
there
could
always
be
a
wrongful
death
action,
for
example,
in
state
court.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
think
our
principles
of
tort
law
except
the
fiction
that,
for
example,
a
suit
for
wrongful
death
does
make
that
deprivation
whole,
but
i
certainly
acknowledge
that
that
is
life
and
that
when
we
are
looking
at
a
procedure
whether
we
are
talking
about
life,
liberty
or
property
may
enter
a
matthews
v.
eldridge
analysis
because
that
is
the
weight
of
the
particular
interest
at
stake.
but
this
court
has
never
severed
property
off
from
the
other
rights,
and
the
due
process
clause,
of
course,
mentions
them
in
the
same
breath.
what
screws
held
was
that
it
did
not
matter
whether
there
were
remedies
after
the
fact,
that
the
deprivation
immediately
at
once
violated
the
due
process
clause.
in
monroe
v.
pape,
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment
although
the
court
does
not
focus
very
often
and
in
fact
i
think
gives
only
a
paragraph
to
which
particular
constitutional
violation
was
at
issue.
another
factor
that
both
those
cases
made
very
clear
is
the
fact
that
abuse
of
power
is
really
at
the
heart
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
points
out
a
very
important
distinction
in
this
case.
this
case
is
not
against
a
prison
warden
as
in
parrat.
it
is
against
the
guard
himself.
as
in
monroe
v.
pape
there
was
an
action
against
the
officials
themselves,
but
the
court
did
not
find
it
difficult
in
that
case
to
say
the
fourth
amendment
had
been
violated.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
this
is
not
a
private
party,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
thing
that
screws
and
monroe
both
made
clear.
he
acted
without
authority,
but
he
was--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
did
not
mean
to--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
never
meant
to
indicate
it
is
a
private
party,
your
honor.
he
sued
the
guard.
he
sued
the
official
who
abused,
but
not
the
people
who
should
have
controlled
the
guard,
not
higher
supervisory
officials.
he
sued
the
guard,
however,
who
quite
clearly
under
screws
and
monroe
was
acting
under
pretense
of
law
and
would
be
a
proper
defendant
under
1983
from
that
standpoint.
to
the
extent
that
he
violated
either
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause
i
think
both
are
proper
for
adjudication.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
why
i
say
that
this
case
is
mostly
governed
by
screws
and
monroe
because
that
argument
was
presented
in
both
of
those
cases,
and
in
both
of
those
cases
as
in
united
states
v.
classic
before
the
courted
stated
that
the
misuse
of
state
power,
the
intentional
misuse
of
state
power
can
be
attributable
to
the
state
itself
in
the
sense
of
the--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
if
this
were
a
parrat
case
i
think
the
result
would
be
the
same.
if
this
were
a
case
suing
the
prison
warden
for
having
allowed
this
prison
guard
to
do
this
then
we
would
look
at
how
frequently
did
the
guard
do
this,
did
they
know
that
the
guard
was
going
to
do
this,
or
was
this
a
random,
unauthorized,
unpredictable
act
by
the
guard
under
otherwise
normal
procedures.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
a
suit
against
the
fellow
who
did
it.
this
is
a
suit
against
the
abusive
guard
himself.
the
only
cases
that
are
that
are
very
notable
which
present
such
a
challenge
are
screws
and
monroe,
and
the
analysis
is
not,
therefore,
the
risk
of
error.
it
is
not,
therefore,
whether
this
was
random,
an
unauthorized
and
uncontrollable
by
the
state.
once
you
are
suing
the
guard
himself
who
abused
then
you
turn
to
screws
and
monroe
when
you
say
does
it
matter
that
it
is
unauthorized,
if
it
is
intentional--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--parrat
was
a
negligent
case,
and
i
believe
if
you
sued
an
individual
who
had
negligently
lost
property,
and
he
said
"yes,
i
negligently
lost
the
property.
"
that
you
would
have
no
due
process
violation
but
you
would
have
no
due
process
violation
because
that
is
negligent.
it
is
not
an
abuse
of
power.
i
think
that
when
you
are
looking
at
the
local
level,
when
you
are
looking
at
the
specific
officer
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
he
is
abusing
his
power
and
acting
under
pretense
of
law
or
is
really
involved
in
an
automobile
accident
or
computer
error.
those
are
not
under
pretense
of
law.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
both.
as
i
understood
your
question
if
i
were
suing...
if
we
were
suing
the
guard
himself
and
said,
"you
lost
this
property.
"
"you
hit
me
with
your
police
car.
"
and
it
is
a
negligence,
not
that
he
was
trying
to
run
him
over,
that
would
simply
not
be
a
due
process
violation.
what
we
have,
of
course,
at
this
level
is
an
intentional
abusive
taking,
but
both
of
those
situations
are
different
from
a
situation
where
we
are
holding
higher
people
to
account
for
policies,
where
we
are
saying
the
procedures
you
have
enacted
do
or
do
not
have
a
high
risk
of
error.
in
logan
there
was
a
too
high
risk
of
error.
in
ingraham
there
was
not.
there
were
many
safeguards
in
ingraham
which
prevented
this,
but
in
all
of
those
cases
and
in
fact
in
most
of
the
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
in
due
process
situations
we
have
been
looking
at
supervisory
officials
for
their
policies
and
whether
they
allowed
too
many
things
to
happen.
in
that
context
i
think
negligence
can
state
a
cause
of
action.
but
if
we
are
looking
to
the
individual
himself
for
his
own
particular
action
i
do
not
think
due
process
is
implicated
unless
we
are
talking
about
an
abuse
of
power,
and
i
think
screws
and
monroe
made
it
very
clear
that
an
abuse
of
power
was
the
very
target
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
you
follow
petitioner's
argument
an
officer...
we
must
remember
that
this
is
not
just
in
prison
settings.
the
due
process
issue
is
not
confined
to
the
prison
setting.
it
applies
to
officers
out
on
the
street
as
well.
if
an
officer
can
walk
up
to
someone
and
grab
his
glasses
off
his
face
because
he
does
not
like
him
and
grind
them
into
the
ground,
petitioner's
argument
would
say
as
long
as
there
is
a
state
tort
of
conversion
the
victim
of
that
abuse
is
confined
to
state
court
exactly
as
if
his
neighbor
had
done
that.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
pardon
me?
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
is
that
his
cell?
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
to
be
candid
i
was
a
little
confused
from
the
record.
i
became
involved
in
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
references
in
the
record
refer
to
locker
and
indicate
that
there
was
a
dormitory.
so
i
am
assuming
from
the
record
that
the
locker
was
within
a
dormitory.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--if
it
were
searched
or
seized
for
no
legitimate
purpose...
well,
it
would
have
been
a
search
and
seizure,
yes.
the
question
of
whether--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--yes.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
am
not
sure
if
it
would
be
a
search.
i
think
if
he
read
it
it
might
be
a
search,
yes.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
is
your
honor
talking
about
a
plain
view
kind
of
exception
then
to
a
search
a
seizure?
perhaps
then
it
would
not
be--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--the
allegations
are--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--my
understanding
from
the
record
is
that
there
is
a
locker
and
that
the
guard
went
into
that
locker
and
as
the
descriptions
from
the
affidavits
indicate
ransacked
the
locker,
went
through
the
locker.
my
client
on
summary
judgment
says
it
was
for
no
purpose.
it
was
not
searching
for
contraband.
it
was
only
to
harass.
that
to
me
would
indicate--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--the
guard,
of
course,
denied
that,
but
we
are
here
on
summary
judgment
so
for
purposes
of
this
case
at
this
point
that
would
be
taken
as
true.
there
were
some
affidavits
filed
in
support
of
that
saying,
yes,
he
conducted
a
ransacking
search
of
this
man's
locker.
from
the
facts
i
do
not
believe
it
was
in
plain
view.
he
deliberately
went
in
there.
now
if
he
went
in
for
a
legitimate
purpose
we
would
have
a
different
analysis,
but
he
went
in
to
abuse--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--it
could
have
been
wide
open,
and
if
the
regulations
allow
the
guard
to
go
in
there--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
my--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--the
facts--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--there
has
been
no
indication
that
it
was
in
plain
view
from
either
side.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
this
was
remanded
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
could
be--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--on
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
they
certainly
could
be.
there
are
many
issues
left
open
to
proof
at
the
district
court
level.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
the
fourth
circuit
remanded
primarily
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
under
the
guidelines
it
set
forth,
but
there
are
many
factual
matters
in
dispute.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
in
dispute
that
it
was
a
search.
plain
view
was
never
raised
by
the
guard.
instead
he
said
it
was
a
legitimate
search
for
contraband,
and
my
client
said
it
was
an
illegitimate
search
for
harassment
purposes.
i
think
that
they
both
conceded
then
that
it
was
a
search
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
again
this
will
be
remanded
and
there
will
be
more
factual
evidence
taken
at
that
level.
i
do
not
know
whether
my
client
would
prevail
once
we
get
back
there,
but
here
for
purposes
of
summary
judgment
it
was
a
search
and
it
was
a
harassment
search.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
did
not
rely
so
strongly.
i
did
urge
that
abuse
of
power
was
an
important
factor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
believe
monroe
v.
pape
as
i
recall
was
cited.
i
did
urge
the
distinguishing
feature.
there
was
the
abuse
of
power.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
do
not
recall.
perhaps
i
did
not.
obviously
if
it
is
not
cited
in
the
fourth
circuit
level
i
did
not.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
there
is
a
willfulness
requirement
in
screws
because
of
the
criminal
nature
of
that
particular
civil
rights--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that
the
civil
rights
act--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
i
believe--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
believe
we
have
screws
although
it
is
not
life.
it
is
property.
we
have
at
this
point
in
this
court
the
facts
that
this
was
deprived...
property
was
destroyed
for
an
abusive
purpose
only,
and
by
abusive
i
mean
under
pretense
of
law
but
for
an
unauthorized
or
illegitimate
purpose.
the
hypothetical
i
was
giving
i
think
would
show
that
there
is
something
inherently
fundamentally
unfair
about
an
officer
on
the
street
being
able...
to
go
back
to
the
glasses
analogy...
to
do
that
and
to
confine
somebody
solely
to
state
court.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
because
there
is
something
different
that
has
happened.
to
say
that
is
to
say
that
the
action
by
the
official
is
not
different
than
the
action
by
the
neighbor.
i
think
justice
harland
very
well
put
it
in
his
concurrence
in
monroe
as
well
as
his
later
concurrence
in
bivens
that
an
action
such
as
that
is
different
in
kind
from
an
action,
the
same
action,
by
a
civilian.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
am
not
sure
what
compensated
in
full
means.
i
think
there
is
another
problem,
however.
if
it
is
a
constitutional
violation
you
can
also
sue
for
injunctive
relief.
if
we
are
saying
that
this
is
no
constitutional
violation
because
you
can
get
full
compensation
in
the
sate
court
then
we
are
also
saying
you
cannot
get
injunctive
relief.
the
state's
duty
is
complete
upon
the
compensation,
and
the
guard
can
keep
on
doing
that
day
after
day.
this
court
recognized
earlier
this
year
that
the
due
process
clause
protects
against
the
arbitrary
use
of
power
in
collander
v.
lawson.
if
it
protects
against
the
arbitrary
use
of
power
certainly
it
protects
no
less
against
the
abusive
use
of
power.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
think
that
which
makes
my
point
most
clear
is
obviously
that
of
justice
rutledge
in
concurrence.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
no.
he
does
not
that
i
know
of,
but
i
again
do
not
know
of
any
opinion
of
this
court
and
i
would
also
caution
the
court
if
we
are
to
make
a
new
distinction
here
the
area
of
due
process
i
do
not
think
anyone
would
doubt
has
many
complexities
already.
i
think
if
we
start
also
a
new
sort
of
layer
of
distinctions
here
between
property
and
life
and
liberty
it
is
going
to
be
all
the
more
confusing
although
it
may
enter
the
analysis
when
we
are
looking
at
a
procedure
about
how
much
process
is
due
and
when
and
how
under
matthews
v.
eldgridge.
what
we
have
here
is
no
process.
when
there
is
no
process,
when
there
is
an
abusive
taking
it
should
not
matter
whether
it
is
life
or
liberty
or
this
pen
here.
if
this
is
my
pen
and
an
officer
takes
it
i
should
not
be
relegated
to
state
court
to
sue
for
its
value
back,
and
once
i
have
done
that
the
due
process
clause
is
silent
and
an
officer
can
keep
on
taking
that
forever.
i
recognize
that--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
they
are
two
entirely
different
guarantees.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
if
this
is
a
seizure,
no,
he
could
not
because
we
would
have
a
constitutional
violation.
but
i
think
they
are
two
separate
ones.
i
think
again
that
the
due
process
clause
itself
recognizes
a
prohibition
against
arbitrary
use
of
power,
and
i
simply
cannot
believe
that
it
any
less
protects
against
power
not
arbitrary
but
abusive.
it
says
that
an
officer
cannot
pick
on
someone
for
no
reason.
certainly
it
cannot
say
any
less
that
someone...
that
an
officer
should
be
able
to
pick
on
someone
for
a
bad
reason,
for
an
abusive
reason.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
that
this
very
conduct,
an
abusive
deprivation,
is
at
the
heart
of
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
conduct
which
was
the
target
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
as
screws
did
hold
though,
yes,
that
was
a
life
deprivation--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--yes.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
question
because
i
read
ingraham
a
little
bit
differently.
i
do
not
read
ingraham
as
saying
that
state
court
remedies
are
going
to
be
always
sufficient
and,
of
course,
ingraham
clearly
does
not
address
substantive
due
process.
ingraham
was
one
of
these
challenges
to
higher
supervisory
officials,
the
school
principal,
an
assistant
principal
and
at
one
point
i
believe
even
the
school
board
though
they
got
dismissed
before
they
reached
this
court.
they
were
the
defendants,
not
the
teacher
who
spanked.
that
is
a
case,
therefore,
where
the
court
looked
at
the
risk
of
abuse
and
said,
"we've
got
state
remedies
that
are
a
deterrent.
"
"we've
got
openness.
"
"we've
got
a
number
of
other
reasons
that
the
risk
of
abuse
is
very
small
and,
therefore,
the
procedure
satisfies
due
process--
"
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
it
would
be
if
we
were
challenging
the
prison
that
allowed
it.
i
think
the
prison
could
say,
"we
had
no
idea
that
this
guard
was
abusive.
"
"this
was
random,
and
the
procedures
we've
instilled
are
basically
secure
against
such
abuse.
"
but
that
is
not
this--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
it
absolutely
would
have
and
should
have
been.
i
think
at
that
case
we
might
have
been
talking
about
something
more
substantive.
that
teacher
who
had
done
the
spanking
to
a
hematoma
might
be
held
accountable
in
a
way
that
somebody
who
had
adopted
the
policy
would
not
be.
that
is
exactly
the
distinction
that
i
think
is
very
important
in
this
case
and
that
has
been
missed
by
petitioner.
this
is
not
a
challenge
to
supervisory
officials.
this
is
a
challenge
to
the
officer
himself.
there
is
no
excuse
for
his
failure
to
deny
due
process.
if
he
wanted
to
take
he
knew
how
to
do
it.
he
did
not
do
it
legally,
and
he
violated
at
once
the
due
process
clause.
accordingly,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
prisoners
and
reversing
the
faulty
due
process
ruling
of
the
fourth
circuit
below.
thank
you.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
yes,
sir.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
am
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
do
see
where
it
says
officer
lephew.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
again
i
was
appointed
at
the
fourth
circuit
level.
i
believe
from
all
of
the
pleadings
i
certainly
get
the
clear
indication
that
it
was
guard
hudson's
abuse,
guard
hudson's
repeated
harassment
that
my
client
was
most
concerned
with
and
in
fact
he
primarily
sought
injunctive
relief
against
guard
hudson.
it
may
be
that
another
officer
assisted
or
participated,
but
he
was
not
suing
everybody
for
everything.
he
was
suing--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
i
was
not
involved
at
the
district
court
level.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
no,
i
was
not.
i
was
appointed
at
the
fourth
circuit
level.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
believe
his
complaint
goes
on
to
give
a
number
of
instances
of
how
this
officer
abused.
of
course,
they
most
clearly
involved
the
search
and
seizure.
they
also
involved
the
destruction
of
his
property,
and
although
another
officer
i
see
is
included
in
one
of
the
incidents
i
think
it
really
adds
credibility
to
my
client's
claim
that
he
wanted
guard
hudson
removed.
that
was--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--he
included
a
number
of
different
harassment
incidents.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
in
his
suit,
in
his
original
suit.
he
talks
about
something
that
happened
on
september
16
and
17.
he
talks
about
the
fact
that
a
false
charge
was
brought
against
him
by
guard
hudson,
that
guard
hudson
had
harassed
him
before,
that
he
said
"next
time
i'll
really
mess
your
cell
up.
"
he
did
a
number
of
things
on
the
16th
and
i
believe
also
the
17th--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--perhaps
so,
your
honor.
but
he
makes
comments
there
that
it
was
more
than
that.
again,
i
think
it
is
important
and
telling
that
he
sued
primarily
for
injunctive
relief.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that
is
correct.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
no.
he
was
proceeding
pro
se.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
