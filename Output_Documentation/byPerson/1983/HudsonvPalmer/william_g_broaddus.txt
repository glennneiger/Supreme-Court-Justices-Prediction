mr.
william
g.
broaddus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
two
petitions
in
this
case
bring
before
this
court
two
important
constitutional
issues
pertaining
to
prison
administration.
the
first
issue,
that
presented
by
the
petitioner,
is
whether
a
prison
inmate
has
some
reasonable
and
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
while
in
prison
so
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendments
against
allegedly
unreasonable
searches.
the
second
issue,
that
presented
by
the
cross
petitioner,
is
whether
a
prison
inmate
whose
property
has
been
destroyed
by
the
random
unauthorized
but
unanticipated
act
of
a
guard
has
in
law
been
deprived
of
property
without
due
process
when
the
state
provides
adequate
post-deprivation
remedies
which
are
adequate
to
make
the
inmate
whole.
these
issues
arose
out
of
an
incident
which
occurred
at
bland
correctional
institution
in
september,
1981.
bland
is
a
state
run
penal
facility
which
houses
450
felons.
according
to
the
inmate's
complaint
the
prison
guard
conducted
a
shakedown,
that
is,
a
search
of
his
locker
but
the
shakedown
was
not
routine
and
was
conducted
for
purposes
of
harassment.
he
further
alleged
that
the
guard
destroyed
some
of
his
property.
although
the
guard
denied
these
allegations
the
district
court
accepted
them
as
true
for
purposes
of
ruling
upon
the
guard's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
trial
court
concluded
that
the
allegations
of
deprivation
of
property
did
not
constitute
a
taking
without
due
process
because
of
this
court's
reasoning
in
the
case
of
parratt
v.
taylor.
the
trial
court
also
concluded
that
the
allegations
of
harassment
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
constitutional
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
both
of
those
rulings.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
inmate
had
some
minimal
right
of
privacy
entitled
to
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
a
guard
could
not
search
unless
there
was
an
established
program
or
policy
for
random
searches
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
guard
had
some
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
prisoner
possessed
contraband.
the
petitioner
submits
the
court
of
appeals
erred
with
respect
to
this
conclusion,
and
i
would
like
first
to
address
this
issue.
it
is
clear
from
this
court's
prior
opinions
that
an
iron
curtain
does
not
exist
between
the
constitution
and
our
nation's
prison.
it
is
equally
clear,
however,
that
prisoners
suffer
a
substantial
reduction
and
even
loss
in
many
rights
and
privileges.
in
each
case
before
the
court
determines
that
an
inmate
possesses
a
right
it
carefully
weighs
that
claim
in
light
of
the
acute
need
of
prison
administration
for
prison
security
because
that
is
the
paramount
need
which
prison
administration
is
charged
with.
secondarily,
it
will
weigh
the
claim
in
light
of
the
effect
upon
the
prison
inmate.
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
a
prison
inmate
possesses
a
right
of
privacy
this
court
is
well
aware
from
its
many
cases
that
prisons
are
dangerous
places.
they
are
used
to
house
dangerous
men.
inmates
may
seek
to
assault,
to
brutalize
other
inmates.
they
may
seek
to
assault
guards.
they
may
seek
to
escape.
the
introduction
of
drugs
and
weapons
into
this
situation
can
only
exacerbate
an
already
dangerous
place
and
situation.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
justice
stevens,
with
respect
to
the
destruction
of
property
aspect,
that,
of
course,
will
be
controlled
by
parrat
v.
taylor.
with
respect
to
the
seizure
of
property
we
would
submit
that
because
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
or
right
of
privacy
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
and
that,
therefore,
a
seizure
would
not
be
controlled
by
the
fourth
amendment
but
by
some
other
aspect,
if
at
all,
such
as
the
taking
of
property
without
due
process.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
of
course,
in
virginia
there
would
be
many
other
ways
in
which
the
inmate
might
recover
that
particular
property,
through
the
inmate
grievance
procedure
or
through
state
actions.
so
he
is
certainly
not
without
remedies
to
recover
in
that
situation.
in
order
to
minimize
the
problems
which
are
brought
about
by
the
introduction
of
drugs
and
weapons
into
prisons
official
surveillance
is
and
as
this
court
has
noted
traditionally
always
has
been
the
order
of
the
day
in
prisons.
if
one
follows
the
analysis
which
this
court
has
established
for
fourth
amendment
cases
which
emanated
out
of
katz
and
applied
more
recently
in
united
states
versus
knox
and
before
that
in
smith
v.
maryland,
one
can
only
conclude
that
a
prisoner
does
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
prison.
first,
does
the
prisoner
himself
actually
expect
privacy?
in
this
particular
situation
we
know
from
the
prisoner's
affidavit
that
he
and
i
quote,
"realizes
routine
shakedowns
are
necessary
to
properly
run
a
prison.
"
so
he
himself
had
no
actual
expectation
of
privacy,
but
even
if
he
did
certainly
society
is
not
prepared
to
legitimize
such
an
expectation
because
society
has
recognized
the
paramount
needs
of
prison
administrators
to
search,
to
seek
out
weapons,
to
seek
out
drugs
and
contraband.
both
society
and
inmates
want
prisons
to
be
a
safe
place,
but
they
can
only
be
safe
if
weapons
and
drugs
and
contraband
are
kept
out.
so
we
would
contend
that
because
the
prisoner
does
not
expect
privacy
and
because
society
is
not
prepared
and
has
not
in
any
way
legitimized
an
expectation
that
he
has
no
basis
for
claiming
privacy
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
we
would
take
the
position,
justice
white,
that
it
does
not
apply.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
that
was
simply
an
allegation
of
destruction
of
property
without
due
process--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--that
is
the
allegation,
yes,
sir,
which
was--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--under
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--under
the
fourth
amendment,
yes,
sir,
we
would.
i
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
right
of
freedom
from
seizures
must
be
something
different
and
separate
and
apart
from
the
taking
of
property
without
due
process.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
in,
for
example,
delaware
v.
prouse
which
could
be
analyzed
as
a
seizure
case
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
intrusion
upon
the
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle,
his
freedom
from
anxiety,
the
limitation
upon
his
movement
and
what
not.
those
concerns
simply
are
not
present
in
prisons.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
there
would
be
no
fourth
amendment
prohibition
in
that
situation.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
well,
if
that
were
to
constitute
abuse
then
under
the
virginia
regulations
which
prohibit
guards
from
abusing
inmates
the
inmate
would
have
redress
under
the
inmate
grievance
procedure
which
has
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
so
he
would
have
redress
there,
but
he
would
not
have
it
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
justice
o'connor,
it
would
be
far
more
than
that.
the
grievance
procedure
would
be
but
the
first
which
would
be
available.
also
in
state
courts
an
inmate
may
sue
in
detinue
or
he
may
sue
in
conversion
and
recover
damages
for
destruction
of
property
or
recover
the
property
itself
in
the
state
court.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
i
would
certainly--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--i
would
certainly
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
if
anything
we
would
insure
that
that
grievance
procedure
operates
the
way
it
is
intended
to
operate
because
it
benefits
not
only
virginia
but
also
federal
courts
and--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--under
the
grievance
procedure
he
would
be
entitled
either
to
recover
the
property
and
have
it
returned
to
him
assuming
it
is
still
in
existence
or
to
be
made
whole
through
payment
of
the
value
of
the
property.
if
the
radio
could
be
valued
he
would
be
made
whole
by
payment
of
the
value
of
the
radio.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
yes,
sir.
funds
are
made
available
to
the
various
institutions,
and
that
is
the
source
of
the
payment.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that
ultimately
goes
up...
it
is
a
hierarchy
level,
if
you
will,
sir,
and
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
claim
it
may
be
the
superintendent
of
the
particular
facility
or
it
may
be
the
regional
superintendent
who
has
control
of
many
various
facilities
or
it
might
be
the
deputy
director
of
the
overall
department
of
corrections.
if
there
is
no
right
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
then
surely
there
must
be
no
right
of
privacy
in
a
prison
inmate--
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
--under
the
grievance
procedure?
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
that
is
correct,
sir.
there
is
none.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
right
of
privacy
which
a
prison
inmate
possesses
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
to
suggest
that
an
inmate
has
an
intimate
right
of
privacy
in
his
locker
comparable
to
a
woman's
fundamental
privacy
to
an
abortion
or
a
couple's
right
of
privacy
to
practice
birth
control
simply
is
novel
at
best
and
to
find
such
in
a
prison
setting
is
simply
untenable.
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
seemed
to
be
calculated
to
give
a
little
bit
to
the
prison
administrator
and
something
to
the
prison
inmate
as
well.
we
suggest
that
that
approach
not
only
splits
the
baby
but
is
simply
unworkable.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
the
prison
inmate
would
not
have
any
greater
enhanced
freedom
from
searches.
he
would
still
be
subject
to
random
searches,
but
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
would
certainly
limit
the
capability
of
the
guard
to
make
a
search
in
a
meaningful
manner
such
that
it
would
deter
the
introduction
to
prisons
of
weapons
and
drugs
and
other
contraband.
now
the
unreasonableness
of
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
is
demonstrated
we
believe
by
a
1976
university
of
virginia
law
review
article
by
gianelli
and
galligan
which
was
cited
with
approval
by
the
court
below.
that
article
suggested
that
a
plan
should
be
promulgated
on
constitutional
grounds
before
prison
guards
may
search.
it
would
require
limitations
upon
the
frequency
and
the
intensity
of
the
search.
it
would
suggest
that
if
a
guard
was
searching
for
a
knife
that
he
would
be
able
to
search
only
in
those
places
where
a
knife
might
be
found,
and
once
the
knife
was
found
the
search
would
have
to
cease.
we
submit
that
such
an
approach
is
unreasonable
and
unworkable.
it
simply
tranforms
the
fourth
amendment
into
a
font
of
tort
law
without
any
privacy
interest
being
present
to
be
implicated.
such
an
approach
would
simply
increase
federal
litigation
without
substantially
advancing
the
rights
of
prison
inmates.
as
i
have
indicated
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
prisoner
is
without
any
protection
whatsoever.
we
do
contend,
however,
that
he
may
not
wrap
himself
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
use
the
fourth
amendment
to
erect
a
wall
between
his
activities
and
necessary
security
activities
undertaken
to
a
properly
run
prison.
we
urge
this
court
to
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
applicable
in
a
prison.
if
the
court
rejects
this
position
then
we
would
further
urge
that
it
should
reject
the
requirement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
random
searches
can
be
conducted
only
pursuant
to
an
established
program
or
policy
for
such.
we
would
urge
this
court
to
adopt
an
approach
which
would
say
that
all
prison
searches
for
security
purposes
undertaken
in
a
reasonable
manner
are
per
se
constitutional
under
the
reasonableness
clause
of
th
fourth
amendment.
that
approach
would
be
comparable
to
what
this
court
has
utilized
in
the
1972
case
of
united
states
v.
biswolf
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
one
in
which
the
court
upheld
warrantless
administrative
searches
in
the
gun
industry
even
though
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
were
not
present
and
there
was
no
plan
for
such
searches.
finally
on
this
point
we
would
also
urge
the
court
to
clarify
that
the
normal
rules
of
proof
and
going
forward
in
civil
cases
should
control
a
1983
claim
such
as
this
and
not
the
burden
shifting
approach
which
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
adopt
in
what
be
more
appropriate
in
criminal
suppression
motions
in
criminal
cases.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
a
second
issue,
that
of
the
parrat
v.
taylor.
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
paul
v.
davis
and
going
through
zimmerman
brush
do
not
depend
upon
the
state
of
mind
of
the
state
actor
or
the
state
public
official
charged
with
the
wrongful
conduct.
indeed
paul
v.
davis,
ingraham
v.
wright,
and
mccollan
v.
baker,
the
action
was
at
least
arguably
intentionally
undertaken.
the
analysis
we
submit
must
depend
instead
upon
whether
the
state
was
logically
able
to
anticipate
the
wrongful
act.
if
the
state
was
not
able
to
anticipate
the
wrongful
act
then
it
was
not
in
a
position
to
provide
in
a
meaningful
manner
a
predeprivation
hearing.
in
that
situation
if
it
does
go
forward
and
provide
in
a
meaningful
manner
a
post-deprivation
remedy
which
is
capable
of
making
the
victim
of
the
tort
whole
under
parrat
v.
taylor,
the
person
has
not
been
deprived
of
procedural
due
process
and
has
not
lost
property
without
due
process
of
law.
in
this
situation
we
have
only
an
allegation
of
random
conduct
which
was
not
sanctioned
or
condoned
by
the
state.
it
was
not
pursuant
to
an
official
scheme
or
plan.
accordingly
the
state
action
is
not
complete,
and
because
the
state
action
was
not
complete
and
the
state
has
provided
meaningful
remedies
there
has
not
been
a
taking
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
in
the
reply
brief
the
cross
petitioner
suggests
that
the
petitioner
seeks
to
constitutionalize
the
deprivation
of
property
without
our
argument.
if
the
state
condoned
the
action
here
then
perhaps
it
would
fall
under
zimmerman
brush,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
as
i
have
indicated
we
have
only
the
random
isolated
single
allegation
of
wrongful
conduct
depriving
someone
of
property,
and
due
process
has
been
provided.
so
the
deprivation
was
not
without
due
process
of
law.
in
conclusion,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
so
that
the
matter
may
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
and
have
that
decision
upheld
dismissing
the
complaint.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
mr.
chief
justice,
at
the
time
of
this
particular
incident
we
had
a
grievance
procedure
in
place
which
was
similar
to
what
is
presently
in
place.
it
is
not
identical
to
the
one
that
is
presently
in
place.
the
one
that
is
presently
in
place
now
has
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
under
the
kripp
act,
42
u.s.c.
1997
i
believe,
and
provides
to
the
inmate
the
opportunity
to
file
complaints
with
respect
to
the
manner
in
which
the
prison
is
run
and
to
seek
redress
of
any
grievance
that
he
might
have
through
that
procedure
and
provided
an
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing
and
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
claim
he
may
indeed
have
an
opportunity
to
be
made
whole.
mr.
william
g.
broaddus
not
unless
the
court
has
questions.
