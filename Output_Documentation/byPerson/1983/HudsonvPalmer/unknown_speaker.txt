unknown
speaker
general
broaddus,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
scope
of
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understood
your
opening
statement
you
were
suggesting
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
no
application
to
searches
in
the
prison.
you
also
say
that
there
is
no
protection
for
the
prisoner
against
seizures
in
searches.
i
notice
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
officer
shook
down
my
locker
and
destroyed
a
lot
of
my
property,
that
is,
legal
materials,
letters
and
other
personal
property.
it
is
not
so
much
the
search
as
the
destruction
of
property.
is
there
a
protection
against
unreasonable
seizures...
that
is
what
i
am
asking...
as
opposed
to
searches.
unknown
speaker
mr.
broaddus,
i
suppose
that
if
i
am
a
policeman
and
you
are
a
suspect
i
may
have
a
probable
cause
that
would
justify
my
searching
for
and
seizing
a
gold
ring
in
your
possession
that
is
maybe
worth
$20,000,
but
the
fact
i
may
seize
it
in
the
fourth
amendment
sense
does
not
justify
me
in
keeping
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
meant
by
the
parrat
rather
than
fourth
amendment
being
applicable
to
the
property
destruction?
unknown
speaker
what
if
in
a
shakedown
which
you
say
is
perfectly
permissible,
a
random
shakedown,
suppose
it
is
and
the
officer
enters
his
cell
and
is
searching
around
and
he
just
picks
up
a
radio
and
carries
it
out.
he
doesn't
destroy
it,
he
just...
you
say
the
fourth
amendment
protection
of
effects
just
does
not
apply
in
a
prison?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
there
was
a
seizure
of
it.
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
a
seizure,
and
i
guess
as
the
case
comes
to
us
we
assume
that
it
was
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
at
least
it
was
seized.
you
say
that
the
prison
authorities
are
completely
free
from
any
fourth
amendment
restraints
from
seizing
a
prisoner's
effects
even
if
they
are
not
contraband
or
even
if
their
possession
is
wholly
consistent
with
prison
rules.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
is
a
separate
question
from
the
search.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be.
that
is
the
argument
going
to
the
search,
the
shakedown.
unknown
speaker
but
even
on
the
search
supposing
you
had
a
prison
system
whereby
they
censored
all
the
incoming
mail
so
it
was
all
read
before
the
prisoner
was
permitted
to
have
it
and
he
gets
his
mail.
could
a
guard
go
in
and
say,
"i
think
i'll
read
your
mail?
"
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
prohibition
at
all
then
would
there?
unknown
speaker
just
what
remedies
are
available
under
state
law
in
virginia
for
redressing
the
property
deprivations,
just
the
grievance
procedure?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
your
view
is
there
any
danger
that
a
state
might
alter
its
grievance
procedure--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
some
of
the
same
protections
would
not
be
available?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
remedy
if
he
prevails
in
a
grievance
procedure?
unknown
speaker
payments
out
of
state
funds?
unknown
speaker
who
is
it
that
makes
the
final
judgment
in
the
grievance
procedure?
unknown
speaker
forgive
my
interrupting
you
again.
i
gather
there
is
no
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
grievance
procedure
that
was
referred
to,
the
procedure
on
which
a
prisoner
can
call
for
some
kind
of
remedy?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
in
searching
the
locker
or
the
cell
of
the
prisoner
they
found
a
pistol
or
narcotics
in
an
examination
and
seizure
of
these
things
without
a
warrant?
what
would
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
admissible
against
him
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
would
not
be
admissible?
is
that
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
how
about
heroin,
14
packages
of
heroin
in
small
packages
for
delivery?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
take
the
search
to
harass
to
mean?
unknown
speaker
not
looking
for
anything
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
now
there
certainly
is
a
middle
ground
between
a
system
for
searching,
a
prescribed
set
of
rules,
and
the
harassing
search
that
you
say
is
a
search
simply
to
no
purpose
whatever.
i
take
then
in
that
case
a
guard
would
simply
figure
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
and
would
just
want
to
wander
through
people's
cells.
unknown
speaker
are
harassing
and
no
legitimate
purpose
equivalent
in
the
way
you
are
using
the
terms?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
apart
from
any
requirement
that
there
be
rules
or
anything
else?
i
take
it
your
view
is
the
fourth
circuit
could
be
affirmed
without
laying
down
any
requirement
that
there
be
rules
for
fourth
amendment
searches
in
prisons.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure,
ms.
wyatt,
i
observe
that
in
your
cross
petition
you
stated
the
question
only
in
terms
of
the
due
process
violation,
not
a
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
a
difference
between
the
facts
in
screws
and
the
facts
here,
though?
unknown
speaker
a
different
kind
of
deprivation,
too,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
all
completed
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
make
the
person
who
suffered
the
deprivation
of
life
whole?
you
cannot
restore
his
life
can
you?
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
confused,
ms.
wyatt.
you
probably
can
clarify
it
very
quickly.
i
can
understand
the
attorney
general's
office
in
virginia
appearing
in
the
case
because
it
is
one
of
their
guards,
one
of
their
attendants
that
is
involved,
but
is
the
state
as
such
a
party
to
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source
of
authority
for
the
court,
any
court,
to
lay
down
any
regulations
about
random
searches
or
any
other
kind
of
searches
in
a
private
law
suit
between
a
prisoner
and
a
guard?
unknown
speaker
can
the
fourth
amendment
be
violated
by
private
parties?
unknown
speaker
i
was
taking
you
up
on
your
statement
that
this
was
private.
unknown
speaker
a
private
suit.
unknown
speaker
your
claim
has
to
be
that
the
state
acting
through
this
guard
deprived
your
client
of
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
it
is
not
a...
the
constitution
does
not
say
no
prison
guard
shall
deprive
a
person
of
property.
it
says
no
state.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
law
on
that
is
quite
clear,
but
i
think
the
parrat
case
says
the
final
judgment
on
the
state's
deprivation
of
due
process
is
not
to
be
pronounced
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
action
of
a
guard
or
a
warden.
it
is
what
opportunity
the
state
offers
to
alleviate
the
claimed
deprivation.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
parrat
would
have
come
out
different
if
the
two
assistant
wardens
or
guards
in
the
mail
room
had
been
sued
rather
than
the
warden?
unknown
speaker
then
to
your
mind
the
distinction
really
turns
on
negligence
versus
intent,
not
the
superior
versus
the
actual
actor.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wyatt,
on
that
very
point
is
this
locker
in
his
cell?
unknown
speaker
the
locker
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
was
that
in
his
cell?
unknown
speaker
i
have
great
problem
with
the
search
and
seizure.
if
these
things
had
been
laying
out
there
would
that
have
been
a
search
and
seizure,
if
they
had
been
laying
on
his
table,
on
his
bed?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
a
search
and
seizure?
unknown
speaker
if
he
just
picked
it
up
off
the
bed?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
search
and
a
seizure,
search
and
a
seizure?
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
be
a
search?
it
is
laying
right
there.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
complaint
that
the
guard
mistreated
this
man,
but
i
do
not
understand
where
the
search
and
seizure
comes
in.
unknown
speaker
your
allegations
do
not
help
me.
what
does
the
evidence
show?
unknown
speaker
the
guard
agrees
to
that?
unknown
speaker
the
door
could
have
been
wide
open.
unknown
speaker
how
can
we
decide
what
we
do
not
know?
unknown
speaker
suppose
i
need
to
know
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
search
and
seizure
whether
it
was
sitting
out
in
plain
view.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
this
evidence
of
this
case
to
show
whether
it
was
or
was
not
in
plain
view.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
open?
was
this
not
remanded
for
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue?
unknown
speaker
the
things
that
my
brother
was
inquiring
about,
would
they
be
open
to
proof
at
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
is
it
or
is
it
not,
not
could
be.
unknown
speaker
did
you
rely
on
pape
and
screws
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
you
raised
in
your
cross
appeal?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
neither
are
cited
nor
addressed
as
i
see
it.
unknown
speaker
you
relied
on
screws?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
screws
to
say
that
in
order
to
deny
a
federal
right
you
have
to
make
it
explicit
that
you
are
doing
it
for
that
purpose.
unknown
speaker
no,
screws
says
you
have
to
say
so.
unknown
speaker
screws
says
if
you
are
an
officer
and
you
are
denying
a
prisoner
or
an
individual
his
rights
you
have
to
make
it
clear
that
you
are
beating
him
up
for
the
sole
purpose
of
denying
him
his
rights.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
what
screws
said?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
fundamentally
unfair
if
he
will
get
paid
at
state
court
the
same
thing
he
will
get
paid
at
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
but
the
injured
party
gets
compensated
in
full
under
the
hypothesis.
so
i
am
asking
why
is
it
so
obviously
unfair?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
screws
case?
which
of
the
opinions
in
the
screws
case
do
you
primarily
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
does
he
refer
at
all
to
deprivations
of
property
in
that
opinion
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
cannot
do
that
if
you
are
right
in
your
fourth
amendment
position.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
right?
if
you
are
correct
on
your
fourth
amendment
submission
he
would
not
keep
doing
it
over
an
over.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wyatt.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
court
held
in
ingraham
v.
wright
that
state
court
remedies
were
an
adequate
process
for
students
subjected
to
corporal
punishment
in
school,
and
that
of
course
is
even
a
liberty
interest,
not
even
a
property
interest.
how
is
the
interest
you
are
talking
about
more
significant
than
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
might
that
not
be
true
here,
too,
for
a
deprivation
of
property
with
state
remedies
that
could
be
considered
adequate?
unknown
speaker
you
think
ingraham
would
have
been
a
different
result
had
one
of
the
teachers
who
had
administered
the
punishment
were
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
there
was
another
guard
or
officer
with
hudson
at
the
time
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
the
affidavit
from
mr.
hudson
on
page
14
of
the
appendix...
perhaps
i
am
misreading
it.
unknown
speaker
the
third
paragraph.
unknown
speaker
why
was
he
not
sued?
unknown
speaker
did
you
request
an
affidavit
from
this
other
officer
also?
unknown
speaker
you
were
not
involved?
unknown
speaker
does
it
suggest
at
all
that
there
may
be
not
have
harassment
if
there
were
two
of
them
there
and
one
of
them
was
not
even
sued?
unknown
speaker
you
only
sued
on
the
one
instance.
unknown
speaker
in
his
suit?
unknown
speaker
he
referred
to
the
16th
and
the
17th
only
i
think.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
you
were
appointed
at
the
fourth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
was
he
represented
by
counsel
in
the
district
court?
