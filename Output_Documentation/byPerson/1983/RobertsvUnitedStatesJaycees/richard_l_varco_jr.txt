mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
issue
today
are
two
conflicting
claims.
on
one
hand,
the
states,
that
it
can
prohibit
sex
discrimination
in
certain
commercial
associations,
and
on
the
other,
the
united
states
jaycees,
with
a
constitutionally
protected
freedom
of
association,
permits
it
to
engage
in
precisely
that
conduct.
in
order
to
understand
those
claims,
it's
necessary
that
the
facts
of
this
case
be
made
clear,
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
do
just
that.
what
the
jaycees
does,
and
what
it
offers,
and
how
it
treats
its
members
are
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
what
the
organization
does
is
offer
leadership
training
and
leadership
skills
and
the
opportunity
to
obtain
those
skills
and
obtain
that
training
to
certain
individuals.
it
offers
this
training
and
these
opportunities
in
three
types
of
programs.
the
first
type
of
program
is
the
program
in
which
the
jaycees
train
an
individual
to
better
himself
or
herself.
such
programs
would
be
learning
how
to
be
a
better
speaker.
a
second
type
of
program
is
a
program
that
they
call
management
skills.
that
indicates
that
the
jaycees
train
people
to
run
meetings,
to
run
programs.
a
third
type
of
program
that
the
jaycees
runs
and
provides
opportunities
for
leadership
training
in
are
programs
which
merge
those
first
two
types
of
skills,
but
which
work
toward
the
betterment
of
the
community,
so
that,
for
example,
an
individual
jaycee
learns
these
individual
skills,
learns
how
to
run
a
program,
and
then
runs
a
program
for
the
betterment
of
their
community.
these
programs
are
made
available
through
some
7,000
local
chapters
by
a
national
organization,
and
they're
run
on
a
local
basis
in
local
communities.
the
unfortunate
part,
from
the
state's
point
point
of
view,
about
these
programs
is
that
women
have
admission
to
the
leadership
training
opportunities
that
are
provided,
but
they're
on
a
limited
basis.
what
women
cannot
do
in
these
organizations
is
that
they
cannot
vote,
they
cannot
hold
office,
and
they
cannot
receive
any
of
the
awards
that
the
jaycees
give
for
performance
in
these
programs.
thus,
what
happens
is
the
jaycees
can
buy
part
of
this
program...
female
jaycees
can
buy
part
of
this
program,
but
they
can't
buy
all
of
it.
now,
the
jaycees
have
pictured
themselves
as
a
private
membership
organization,
and
i
think
it's
essential
to
understand
that
they
really
operate
the
way
a
business
operates.
for
example,
their
national
headquarters
in
tulsa,
oklahoma
have
a
marketing
department,
a
department
that's
designed
to
shape
and
promote
the
jaycee
image.
in
1980
this
had
40
employees
and
had
a
budget
of
some
$2
million.
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
a
membership
development
department
that
creates
these
programs
that
i
referred
to
you
about.
in
the
1980
annual
report
the
jaycees
referred
to
these
programs
as
some
among
the
most
useful
that
they
have
in
getting
career
opportunities
and
new
jobs.
another
indication
of
the
business
aspect
of
this
community...
of
this
organization...
is
the
way
in
which
the
jaycees
recruit.
for
example,
in
1980
they
had
a
membership
of
some
295,000
members;
120
to
130,000
of
those
members
had
been
recruited
the
previous
year.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--i
think
what
it
shows
is
that
it
operates
the
way
a
business
operates.
businesses
go
out
and
seek
customers.
they
go
out
on
a
continuous
basis
to
look
for
people
to
buy
their
products.
that's
precisely
what
the
united
states
jaycees
does
in
this
case.
they're
continually
looking
for
new
people
to
bring
into
their
organization.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
that
in
a
fraternity,
for
example,
justice
rehnquist,
you
have
a
situation
in
which
there
are
ties
that
bind
the
members
which
are
significantly
different
than
the
ties
that
bind
the
people
in
the
jaycees.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
well,
i
bring
that
point
out
to
show
that
that's
one
of
the
aspects
of
their
business.
i
think
some
clubs,
for
example,
some
private
social
clubs
don't
show
this
rush
that
fraternities
do.
they're
very
discreet
and
private,
there's
no
recruiting
that
goes
on,
you
have
to
know
somebody
to
belong.
so
i
think
that
if
we're
weighing
the
jaycees
on
the
spectrum
of
where
they
belong,
the
fact
that
they
go
out
and
seek
these
people
actively
shows
that
they're
more
like
a
business
and
they
work
more
like
a
business
than
they
do
like
a
private
social
club.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
the
jaycees'
programs
are
offered
to
people
between
the
ages
of
18
and
35.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
it
certainly
does,
but
in
the
state
of
minnesota
that's
not
illegal.
there
is
no
provision
against
age
discrimination
in
the
state.
it
is
a
form
of
discrimination;
it
is
a
discriminatory
judgment
that
they
make.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
the
record
indicates
quite
what
their
turnover
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
there's
nothing
remarkable
about
it.
but
the
reason
i
bring
that
point
up--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
it's
a
businesslike
aspect
to
it.
in
other
words,
i'm
sure
that
there
are
some
clubs
that
we
would
all
agree
would
be
private,
that
don't
engage
in
this
particular
type
of
recruiting,
and
they
lose
members
quite
regularly;
i
don't
know
if
they
replace
them
on
the
same
basis.
i
think
we
could
hypothesize
that
they
don't.
but
this
club
recruits
aggressively.
it
has
a...
it
refers
to
its
new
members
as
customers.
it
solicits
them
in
a
way
that
business
is
solicited.
it
goes
out
into
the
marketplace
and
looks
for--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
the
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
chapters,
in
contravention
of
the
financial
charter,
recruited
women.
i
don't
think
that
the
national
jaycees
recruits
women.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
the
jaycees,
justice
white,
have
several
categories
of
members.
the
two
that
are
important
are,
for
this
case,
are
individual
member
which
is
limited
to
men
between
the
ages
of
18
and
35,
and
associate
members
which
is
a
category
of
membership
that
women
can
have.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
they
do.
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--yes,
they
have
to
pay
if
they
come
in.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
again,
i
hate
to
fall
back
on
what
the
record
says,
but
the
evidence
in
our
record
consisted
of
what
the
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
chapters
did,
and
it
consists
of
a
large
number
of
materials
about
how
the
national
chapter
operates.
the
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
chapters
recruited
aggressively
for
them
because,
of
course,
they
treated
them
equally.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
as
individual
members.
but
there
is
nothing
in
there,
in
the
record,
that
shows
how
the
associate--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i'd
agree
with
the
first
half
of
that
formulation.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
whether
it's
a
good
idea
or
not
makes
no
difference
to
this
court.
i
think
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
jaycees
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
evade
what
is
an
otherwise
valid
state
law.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes.
and
in
minnesota
they
do.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
think
the
good
sense
of
it
is
particularly
relevant.
i
agreed
with
your
first
part
of
the
question,
that
the
good
sense
makes
no
difference
here.
it's
simply
a
question
of
constitutional
and
statutory--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
no.
that
only
served
as
the
petrie
dish
upon
which
this
all
grew.
it
sprung
from
this
particular
way
in
which
the
jaycees
treated
their
female
members.
the
jaycees'
grounds--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
depend
on
several
things.
there
is
a
statutory
analysis
that
you'd
have
to
make,
and
i
think
there's
a
constitutional
analysis
that
you'd
have
to
make.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
if
the
admission
of
whites
to
this
black
institution
in
your
hypothetical
could
be
shown
to
interfere
with
some
constitutionally
protected
freedom...
let's
say
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
hold
a
belief
or
to
advocate
a
belief...
then
the
state
of
minnesota,
i
think,
would
have
trouble
requiring
through
its
public
accommodations
law
that
those
people
be--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--it
probably
does,
justice
o'connor,
but
that
freedom
is
not
interfered
with
in
this
particular
case.
the
regulation
that
the
state
of
minnesota
imposes
upon
the
jaycees
which
requires
them
to
admit
women
would
not
have
the
effect
of
interfering
with
any
position
that
the
jaycees
takes
on
these
issues
that
purportedly
concern
young
men.
and
i
can
tell
you
why
that's
so.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
no,
it
is
not.
it's
not
foreseeable
at
all,
because
the
assumption
in
your
hypothetical,
probably
quite
an
accurate
one,
is
that
the
iraquis
would
have
a
different
point
of
view
on
that
war
than
the
iranians.
i
think
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
here
is
that
the
issues
that
the
jaycees
purportedly
calls
men's
issues
are
not
issues
on
which
sex
determines
your
point
of
view,
much
the
way...
or
to
the
contrary
of
what
happens
in
the
iran/iraq
situation.
in
addition
to
that,
the
jaycees
hold
up
their
membership
to
no
politica
litmus
test
the
way
the
iraq/iran
hypothetical
would.
men
can
hold
these
divergent
views.
they
can
hold--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--i
think
the
record
shows,
justice
white,
that--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--well,
the
record
shows
that
the
admissions
practices
of
the
jaycees
don't
entail
any
sort
of
agreement
with
a
particular
issue.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
erroneous
assumption
that
because--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--men
uttered
something,
that
that
was
a
man's
point
of
view.
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
that
because
men
uttered
it,
men
would
hold
this
point
of
view
and
women
wouldn't.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
that.
and
quite
to
the
contrary,
what
the
record
shows
is
that
the
jaycees
don't
require
any
particular
political
ideology.
a
striking
fact,
i
think,
is
that
they
don't
even
require
you
to
pass
the
test
if
you
come
in
with
respect
to
the
very
issue
that's
here.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
if
there's
absolutely
no
difference
between
the
organization
in
your
hypothetical
and
the
organization
here,
then
i
would
say
that
they
could
not
do
that.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that
would
make
no
difference
for
purposes
of
this
application
of
this
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
if
we
accepted
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
i
guess
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
disagree
with
them
both
on
the
law
and
on
the
facts.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
that
question,
justice
o'connor,
from
two
points
of
view.
first,
from
a
factual
point
of
view.
and
i
think
that
the
factual
point
of
view
is
illustrated
by
justice
rehnquist's
observations.
there
would
be...
there's
a
factual
difference
between
the
iranian
and
iraqui
points
of
view
on
this
particular
war.
in
this
case,
what
we
disagree
with
is
that
the
entrance
of
women
into
the
jaycees
will
result
in
any
difference
of
opinion
on
the
particular
issues
that
the
jaycees
speaks
on.
there
simply
is
no
basis
for
that.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
think
what
it
would
change
would
be
the
nature
of
the
regulation
that
the
state
could
impose
upon
them.
it
couldn't
force
them
to
take
into
their
organization
people
who
disagreed
with
that
particular
point
of
view,
because
that
would
then
be
content
regulation.
we'd
be
regulating
the
content
of
their
speech
or
their
beliefs.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
it's
obvious
that
there
are
some
women
who
probably
agree
with
that
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment
and
for
purposes
of
analyzing
this
case,
as
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
has
progressed
this
far,
the
answer
is
probably
yes.
there
are
two
other
areas--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--it
could
certainly
do
that,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
in
this
particular
case
it
is,
yes,
because
there
is
no
regulation
of
content
based
speech
here.
what
i
was
going
to
suggest
is
that
the
first
amendment,
while
it
protects
not
only
content-based
speech,
it
also
protects
certain,
private,
intimate
gatherings.
i
think
that
as
an
extension
of
that,
there
is
probably
someplace
in
the
concept
of
liberty,
the
notion
that
the
government
shouldn't
regulate
certain
types
of
behavior
that
aren't,
while
not
intimate,
are
nonetheless
personal.
so,
for
example,
the
government
shouldn't
be
telling
people
who
they
have
to
go
on
picnics
with.
on
none
of
those
three
bases,
the
content
base,
the
privacy
base,
or
this
substantive
due
process
base
do
the
jaycees
fit
in,
because
the
relationships
that
the
people
have
here
are
simply
too
impersonal
and
too
commercial
to
be
accorded
any
of
those
types
of
protection.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
not
in
this
particular
instance,
no,
because
voting
is
part
of
what
you
do
as
a
jaycee.
you
take
positions
on
issues.
you
elect
officers.
the
election
of
officers
is
a
reflection
of
how
you're
trained
and
how
you're
viewed,
so
i
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
prohibit
the
state
from
regulating
the
voting
in
the
jaycees.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
it
does.
the
jaycees,
about
once
a
year,
issue
what
they
call
external
policy
statements,
and
they
are
three
or
four
in
number,
and
they
appear
in
the
front
of
their
annual
report
each
year,
and
they
are
positions
on
various
political
issues.
the
vote
on
those
comes
up
through
the
states,
through
their
delegates
to
the
annual
convention,
and
is
voted
on
by
their
executive
committee
and
their
executive
board
of
directors.
so,
through
a
process
of
representation
and
a
process
of
distilled
voting,
the
organization
issues
those
statements.
but
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
the
requirement
that
women
get
into
this
organization,
the
requirement
that
the
state
puts
on
them
through
its
public
accommodations
statute,
wouldn't
affect
the
positions
that
the
jaycees
takes
on
those
particular
issues,
because
there
is
no
sex-based
link
between
the
issues.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
it's
incorporated.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes.
it's
a
missouri
corporation.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
the
national,
justice
white.
the
national.
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
don't
think
that
they
are.
i
think
that
they
could
be
viewed
as
you
would
view
a
franchise,
various
franchises,
without
the
corporate
aspect
of
it.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
know.
i
suspect
that
the
national
files
income
tax
returns.
i
would
doubt
that
the
local
chapters
file
income
tax
returns.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
not
the
monetary
types.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
think
that
they
might.
i
think
that
some
of
the
local
chapters
might.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--yes.
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this:
after
you're
recruited,
if
you
learn
about
the
jaycees
through
the
recruitment
that
they
do...
and
they
do
recruit
through
efforts
of
their
members
and
through
letters
to
corporations,
through
letters
to
businesses
seeking
members...
you--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--they
pay
a
fee,
a
membership
fee.
and
that
fee
buys
them
the
right
to
be
a
member
in
the
organization
and
to
receive
the
training
and
the
benefits
that
the
organization
has.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
they
market
and
sell
that
training,
the
jaycees
does.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
would
characterize
it
as
an
annual
report
that
a
business
puts
out.
it
has
all
of
the
same
items
in
there
that
many
corporate
reports
have.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
what
characterizes
this
as
a
business
as
opposed
to
a
voluntary
association
or
a
private
membership
club
is
the
commercial
nature
of
the
transaction
that's
involved.
the
ties
that
bring
people
to
this
are
the
desire
to
buy
something
for
a
price,
to
get
some
training,
to
participate
in
this.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
don't
think
any
one
factor
is
dispositive.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
describe
are
the
various
aspects
of
that
offering
to
the
public.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes,
but
this
organization
doesn't
make
its
money
solely
off
of
dues.
if
you
look
at
their
annual
report
for
1980,
i
believe
that
their
budget
was
$4.2
million
and
only
$2.6
of
that
came
from
dues.
the
rest
of
that
money
came
from
other
sources,
sales
of
merchandise,
sales
of
membership
lists,
advertising
in
a
magazine
that
they
publish.
and,
justice
stevens,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
say
it
was
a
business
and
it
offered
its
goods
and
services
to
the
public,
but
when
it
did
it
looked
at
an
extensive
record
which
shows
just
how
similar
to
a
business
this
organization
is,
viewing
its
members
as
customers,
selling
and
advertising
the
way
a
business
would.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes.
underlying
that
is
the
fact
that
what
gets
you
into
the
jaycees
is
your
ability
to
spend
the
money
to
do
it,
in
the
same
way
that
your
ability
to
purchase
goods
in
a
department
store
is
based
upon
the
dollars
that
you
have
in
your
pocket.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
well,
one
thing
that
is--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
there
is
so
much
evidence
about
the
jaycees
and
so
little
about
precisely
these
clubs
that
you've
described.
and
my
suspicion
is,
is
that
the
difference
between
the
jaycees
and
these
clubs
is
that
there
is
some
degree
of
selectivity,
something
other
than
the
ability
to
spend
money.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
but
if
there's
a
privacy
aspect
that
has
to
be
protected
here,
it's
protected
because
of
selectivity.
it's
because
this
organization
is
more
like
the
picnic
among
friends
or
the
private
club
in
which
friendship
or
status
gets
you
in.
that
simply
isn't
here
true
with
respect
to
the
jaycees.
anybody
can
get
in.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
by
the
same
token,
that
simply
is
too
big
a
pool
to
say,
because
they
exclude
women,
they're
not
selective.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
the
composition
of
the
pool.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
it's
too
public
a
pool.
the
distinction
between
men
and
women
is
simply
too
large
a
distinction
to
claim
that
if
we
keep
women
out,
we're
not
offering
this
to
the
public.
i
think
there's
cases
distinguishing
the
private
club
exemption
under
title
ii
in
which
football
as
a
sport
was
offered
only
to
youth,
a
far
narrower
field
than
we
have
here,
in
which
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
public
offering
because
it
was
offered
to
such
a
big
group
of
people.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever--
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
--if
the
girl
scouts
operate
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
jaycees
operate
in,
they
will
probably
be
considered
a
public
accommodation
for
purposes
of
the
minnesota
human
rights
act.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i
see
very
little
difference
between
what
the
jaycees
do
and
how
they
operate
and
being
able
to
go
into
a
hotel
with
a
dollar
and
get
a
room
or
a
meal.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
not
in
this
town,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
richard
l.
varco,
jr.
unless
the
court
has
some
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
no
further
remarks.
