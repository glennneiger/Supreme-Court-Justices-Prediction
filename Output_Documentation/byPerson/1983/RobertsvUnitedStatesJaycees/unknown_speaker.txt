unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that...
how
does
that
bear
on
any
of
the
issues
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
they
get
their
numbers?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true
of
social
fraternities,
too.
fraternities
are
constantly
rushing.
they
want
a
new
pledge
group
every
year.
does
that
make
them
a
business
organization?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
those
differences,
but
i
think
one
of
them
is
not
a...
there
is
not
a
difference
between
their
desire
for
new
members
at
frequent
intervals.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
association
of
this
kind
has
one
thing
in
common
with
a
fraternity
that
was
just
mentioned,
in
that
the
fraternity
has
access
to
these
people
for
about
four
years
of
undergraduate
work,
and
perhaps
a
little
longer,
and
you
have
an
age
limit
here.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that
age
limit?
unknown
speaker
does
that
violate...
does
that
discriminate
against
older
people?
unknown
speaker
with
that
turnover--
unknown
speaker
--with
that
age
limit,
there's
a
very
substantial
turnover
in
membership,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
know
what
the
record
shows.
you
just
need
to
look
at
the
numbers.
at
age
35
or
36,
every
year
quite
a
few
of
them
are
going
out,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
in
order
to
maintain
an
organization,
they've
got
to
have
a
program
at
the
bottom
side
to
bring
new
ones
in,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
what's
remarkable
about
that?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
it
make
it
a
business?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
make
it
a
business?
unknown
speaker
it
recruits
women,
too,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
recruits
women,
too,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you,
in
describing
the
jaycees
at
the
outset,
you
said
that
women
can
be
limited
members.
unknown
speaker
don't
they
recruit
for
them?
unknown
speaker
that's
strange,
isn't
it?
they
must
have
to
pay,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
they
would
be
recruiting
them
all
the
time.
that's
one
of
their
rights.
unknown
speaker
as
members.
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
how
sensible--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
agree
that
the
core
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
this
is
a
good
idea
to
include
or
exclude
women,
but
whether
it
is
required
as
a
matter
of
law.
is
that
not
the
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
second
half?
unknown
speaker
or
whether
people
who
are
not
members
have
a
statutorily
guaranteed
right
to
come
in.
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
the
good
sense
of
it
relevant
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
there's
two
organizations
in
the
two
cities
that
thought
it
was
a
good
idea.
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
nothing
to
do,
has
it,
with
whether...
with
the
legal
question
that's
presented
here.
unknown
speaker
would
the
statute
in
your
state
be
applied
to
prevent
a
group
of
blacks
from
forming
an
all-black
club
to
advocate
causes
and
interests
to
black
citizens,
and
compel
that
group
to
admit
whites?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
found
to
be
as
much
of
a
public
accommodation
as
the
jaycees,
then
do
you
think
that
there
would
be
a
first
amendment
right
of
that
black
association
that
would
override
any
state
regulations?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
first
amendment
incorporate
a
right
to
advocate
causes
relating
just
to
young
men?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
you
tried
to
tell
judge
arnold,
but
he
didn't
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
were,
in
minneapolis,
an
iranian
society
devoted
to
the
propagation
of
iranian
interests,
and
one
of
their
big
positions
was
that
iraq
is
all
bad?
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
comes
along
and
says,
well,
these
iraqui
people
that
wanted
to
belong
to
the
iranian
society
are
free
to
join
it
under
our
public
accommodations
law.
you
have
to
let
them.
and
then
the
state
tries
to
defend
on
a
constitutional
basis,
and
says,
well
look,
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
iranian
society
can't
keep
on
advocating
just
what
it
always
did;
that
iraq
is
all
bad.
and
their
answer,
i
suppose,
would
be
if
you
admit
enough
iraquis
into
the
iranian
society,
they're
going
to
quite
substantially
change
the
purpose
of
the
organization.
isn't
that
the
same
foreseeable
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
these
are
factual
assertions
about
the
character
of
this
organization.
are
we
supposed
to
take
your
word
for
it,
or
how
are
these
things
supposed
to
be
sorted
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
apparently
it
didn't,
or
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
believed
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
thought
there
was
something
in
the
notion
that
the
jaycees
were
giving
a
male
point
of
view,
and
that
is
was
distinguishable
enough
that
the
state
couldn't
force
them
to
take
in
women.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you--
unknown
speaker
--going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
what
if
the
blacks
decided
that
we
should
have
our
own
jaycee,
because
we
ought
to
really
promote
black
business
participation
in
black
businesses,
and
things
like
that?
so
they
had
an
absolute
carbon
copy,
so
to
speak,
of
the
jaycees,
but
they
are
all
limited
to
black
membership.
they
did
exactly
the
same
things,
took
great
part
in
community
work,
trained
leadership,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
difference
is
that
they're
all
black.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
under
the
minnesota
supreme
court
of
the
matter
and
your
view
of
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
under
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
you're
elevating
the
type
of
speech
involved
to
different
levels
of
protection?
the
type
of
advocacy
involved?
is
it
more
important
in
one
case
than
another?
are
you
saying
that
there
can
be
no
first
amendment
advocacy
right
on
allegedly
concerns
of
only
male
citizens?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
jaycees
had
taken
a
position
that
the
equal
rights
amendment
is
bad,
and
that
women
getting
into
the
job
market
is
a
bad
development?
now,
if
they
had
taken
those
two
positions,
which
i
am
aware
they
have
not,
would
that
change
your
answer
to
any
of
justice
o'connor's
questions?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
they
still
couldn't
just
flatly
ban
women,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes,
yes.
is
the
government
limited
to
regulating
only
non-speech
activities
of
an
organization?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
if
an
organization
did
have
both
social
non-speech
activities
that
it
performed
and
certain
advocacy
functions
that
it
performed,
that
the
state
could
relate
just
the
social
non-speech
activities
within
that
organization?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
effect
of
your
state's
law?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
occasion
of
voting,
for
instance,
in
the
organization
on
what
political
positions
the
organization
will
take?
is
that
protected
activity?
unknown
speaker
and
the
organization
never
takes
a
vote
on
what
positions
to
espouse
for
political
or
advocacy
purposes?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
you
refer
frequently
to
the
fact
that
the
jaycees
are
a
business
or
a
commercial
organization.
you
touched
on
a
couple
of
points
that
perhaps
support
that
view.
i'll
ask
you
a
question
or
two,
and
then
i'd
like
to
hear
you
itemize,
a,
b,
c,
d,
the
characteristics
that
make
this
a
business.
i
suppose
these
chapters
are
nonprofit
corporations.
are
they
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
they
are
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
right.
did
it
pay
any
income
taxes?
what
is
a
missouri
corporation?
the
international
or
the
chapter?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
chapters?
are
they
incorporated?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
turn
you
back
to
justice
powell.
let's
see.
i
asked
you
whether
or
not
they
had
filed
income
tax
returns.
unknown
speaker
in
that
respect,
is
it
any
different
from
the
kiwanis
club?
i'm
sure
they
pay
no
dividends.
you
said
they
were...
solicit--
unknown
speaker
--do
they
advertise
in
the
newspapers
and
magazines
for
members?
radio
and
television
for
members?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
they
do?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know.
well,
you
say
they
buy
members.
is
this
like
buying
products
in
a
supermarket?
what
do
you
men
by
that?
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
term
"buy".
unknown
speaker
what
do
they
pay?
in
other
words,
if
you
buy,
you
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
they're
selling
the
training.
unknown
speaker
do
they
publish
any
annual
reports
showing
profits
and
loss?
unknown
speaker
are
those
in
the
record?
exhibit
20,
your
honor,
is
one
of
their--
--an
annual
report
that's
sort
of
like
a
church
report
or
business
report,
or
how
would
you
characterize
that?
unknown
speaker
what
other
characteristics
make
these
entities
businesses
rather
than
voluntary
associations?
unknown
speaker
but
churches
train
people
for
religion,
and
all
sorts
of
organizations
train
for
civic
participation...
kiwanis,
rotary,
lions,
masons,
whatever.
is
the
training
factor
alone
dispositive
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
aside
from
training,
what
else?
mr.
varco,
if
i
may
interrupt,
you
say
one
factor
that
isn't
dispositive.
i
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said
there
was
just
one
factor
it
relied
on...
was
the
public
sale
of
memberships
to
anybody
who
would
pay
the
price.
that's
the
whole
basis
for
their
finding,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
rely
on
anything,
as
i
read
their
opinion,
for
the
business
holding
except
for
the
fact
of
the
public
sale
of
memberships
to
anybody
who
was
18
to
35,
male,
and
would
pay
the
price.
but
every
private
club
requires
dues.
often
they
require
the
payment
of
an
initiation
fee.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
the
principal
point
they
relied
on...
they
made
other
findings,
too...
but
on
the
business
issue,
the
thing
they
stressed
was
simply
that
they
just
sold
these
memberships
like
anybody
who
wanted
to
buy
them
can
have
one.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
different,
in
what
respect,
from
the
kiwanis,
the
rotary,
and
29
other
luncheon
clubs?
unknown
speaker
they
purchase
the
membership,
in
your
terms,
for
x
dollars
and
pay
so
much
every
time
they
attend
a
luncheon.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
these
clubs
that
justice
powell
and
others
have
referred
to,
very
frequently
they
take
one
lawyer,
one
doctor,
one
dentist,
one
hairdresser
perhaps,
and
the
purpose
of
that...
there
can't
be
much
doubt
about
it...
to
promote
business
for
the
doctors,
the
lawyer,
the
banker,
whoever.
now,
why
is
the
kiwanis
club
or
the
rotary
club
any
different
from
the
junior
chamber
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
selectivity
in
one
sense,
that
it's
just
one
lawyer,
so
that
he
has
a
monopoly
or
a
potential
monopoly
on
that
incoming
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
they
assert
that
they're
selective
in
that
they
want
only
males
between
the
ages
of
18
and
36
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
who
says
it's
too
big
a
pool?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
says
that's
too
big
a
pool
in
your
terms?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
girl
scouts
now
in
minnesota?
are
they
going
to
have
to
be
a
public
accommodation
and
admit
boys,
do
you
suppose,
because
there
may
be
an
aggressive
marketing
between
certain
ages
of
members?
unknown
speaker
and
the
boy
scouts,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
the
district
court
said
that
even
if
the
jaycees
are
interested
in
promoting
only
women's...
only
men's
point
of
view...
that
the
state
interest
is
compelling
and
overrides
that
association
freedom.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
just
like
a
hotel?
unknown
speaker
where
can
you
go
to
a
hotel
for
a
dollar?
[laughter]
speak
up.
unknown
speaker
you
can
take
that
as
a
figure
of
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
young
businessmen?
unknown
speaker
any
young
men.
young
preachers,
anybody?
unknown
speaker
school
teachers?
young
school
teachers?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
can
you
identify
any
of
those
programs
in
which
the
sex
of
the
participant
supporting
it
would
tend
to
make
him
either
support
or
oppose
the
program?
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably,
it
would
change
the
organization
because
they'd
have
women
instead
of
just
men.
but
would
it
change
any
of
the
programs
that
they
have
been
engaged
in
since
1920?
unknown
speaker
which
of
the
programs
advances
the
interests
of
young
men
without
equally
advancing
the
interests
of
young
women
who
might
also
be
executives?
unknown
speaker
how
about
any
internal
objective
of
the
organization?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
word
1920,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
the
word
"men"
was
often
used
to
cover
both
sexes.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
would
change
the
organization.
how
it
would
it
change
it?
is
there
some...
does
the
record
have
some
explanation
in
it
by
the
national
organization,
by
its
officers,
as
to
why
they
confined
their
membership
to
men,
other
than
we
just
like
men
better
than
women?
unknown
speaker
what
interests
are
there
of
young
men
that
would
be
frustrated
by
having
women
members?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
really
sort
of
a
club
sort
of
a
rationale,
a
privacy
rationale,
other
than
a
first
amendment
rationale,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
was
communicating
anything
distinctive
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
you...
i
thought
you
answered
justice
stevens
that
you
don't
know
of
anything
that
would
be
different
externally.
all
of
its
communications
would
be
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what?
what
wouldn't?
how...
what
would
happen?
unknown
speaker
can
you
name
me
one
position
that
applies
only
to
men?
unknown
speaker
one
position
that
they
have
taken
that
applies
only
to
men.
unknown
speaker
have
they
done
so
up
to
date?
unknown
speaker
the
only
position
they've
taken
is,
they
don't
have
any
interest
in
women.
unknown
speaker
have
they
taken
that
vote
or
not?
unknown
speaker
they
haven't
taken
that
vote,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
would
you
respond
to
the
view
of
the
state
that
this
is
a
business?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
an
important
question,
since
apparently
that
was
a
basic
decision
on
which
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--everything
you've
said
so
far
could
apply
to
a
business.
what
about
the
concept
of
selling
membership?
unknown
speaker
but
some
organizations
vote
people
in.
do
you
vote
them
in
here,
or
do
they
just...
you
pay
your
dues
and
you
come
in?
unknown
speaker
so
anybody
can
walk
in
off
the
street
and
join,
if
you're
male?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
can't
compare
that
with
all
those
organizations
you
named.
unknown
speaker
some
of
those
organizations
you
named,
one
vote
can
keep
you
out.
unknown
speaker
right.
well,
that's
a
little
different.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
may
i
ask
you
just
a
question?
the
debate
as
to
whether
it's
a
business
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--in
what
sense
are
we
asking
that
question?
i
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
told
us
in
a
rather
surprising
opinion,
to
be
quite
honest
about
it,
says
it
is
"a
business
within
the
meaning
of
of
the
minnesota
statute.
"
unknown
speaker
so
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
that's
where
we
start
from?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
the
power
to
reinterpret
the
minnesota
statute?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
just
accept
the
fact
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
minnesota
statute,
this
is
a
business?
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
case.
unknown
speaker
why?
you
would
still
have
your
constitutional
argument.
unknown
speaker
just
because
it's
a
business
doesn't
solve
your
constitutional
question.
all
it
does
is
solve
that
it's
a
public
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
is.
the
minnesota
legislature
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
can't
determine
the
constitutional
question
here.
we
determine
that
issue,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
we
determine
the
constitutional
question--
unknown
speaker
--not
the
minnesota
legislature
or
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
because
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
says
this
is
a
business
under
minnesota
law.
that's
the
last
word
on
minnesota
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
what
about
the
selectivity
question?
can
any
young
man
between
18
and
35
be
admitted?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
is
it
a
fact
that
any
man
between
those
ages
is
admitted?
unknown
speaker
part
of
your
submission
is
that
the
first
amendment
protects
private
organizations,
whether
they're
communicative
organizations
or
not.
just
fraternal
organizations.
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
which...
none
of
which
you
can
identify
that
would
be
different
if
women
were--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
haven't
identified
one
yet.
i've
asked
about
it
several
times.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
know
what
its
viewpoint
is.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know?
all
men
don't
agree
on
it
either.
unknown
speaker
but
you
just
think
it
inevitably
would
be
different?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
something
that
has
to
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
organization.
if
you
have
an
organization
of
all
male
stockbrokers
that
are
solely
concerned
with
the
business
of
stockbrokering
and
what's
happening
to
stockbrokering,
and
they're
required
to
take
in
women
stockbrokers,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
great
focus
on
stockbrokering
may
be
very
little
different
between
men
and
women.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
an
organization
of
male
chauvinists
that
says
we're
tried
of
this
affirmative
action
in
favor
of
women,
we
want
what
we
think
is
a
square
deal,
it
seems
to
me
there
you
get
a
different
thing.
but
you
haven't
really
shown
that
the
jaycees
are
in
the
latter
category
at
all,
that
they
espouse
anything
close
to
men's
rights
or
the
kinds
of
issues
that
men
and
women
might
feel
differently
about.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
just
afraid
that
the
women
will
"take
over"?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
suffragette
movement
of
a
century
ago
had
taken
in
men,
they
probably
wouldn't
have
had
the
women's
vote
quite
as
soon
as
they
did,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
i'm
afraid
we're
not
giving
you
much
chance
to
argue,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
in
its
holding
paragraph
on
page
a2,
says
this:
"we
hold
that
the
jaycees,
a
substantial
part
of
whose
activities
involve
the
expression
of
social
and
political
beliefs
and
the
advocacy
of
legislation
and
constitutional
change
does
have
the
right
of
association
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
"
no.
1,
do
you
think
the
record
supports
that
reading
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
those
exhibits
are
in
the
record,
but
not
in
any
appendix
that
we
have
before
us.
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
them
can
you
identify
as
just
male
issues,
as
just
promoting
the
interests
of
men.
as
you
say,
your
primary
interest
is
in
promoting
the
interests
of
young
men.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
all
of
your
public
positions...
none
of
your
public
positions
can
you
identify
as
"promoting
the
interests
of
young
men.
"
as
distinguished
from
young
women.
unknown
speaker
and
associating
with
other
young
men.
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
those
projects
designed
to
teach
them
to
be
good,
effective
executives?
unknown
speaker
that's
part
of
their
training
to
be
effective
executives,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
women
wouldn't
learn
the
same
thing?
women
learn
exactly
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
the
associate
members
do?
don't
they...
don't
they
participate
in
these
programs?
unknown
speaker
don't
the
associate
members,
the
women,
participate
in
these
programs?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
they
participate
in
all
these
training
programs.
they
learn
how
to
run
meetings.
unknown
speaker
sure,
they
run
projects
and
they're
trained,
and
they
get
the
same
exposure,
except
they
aren't
officers
of
the
organizations
and
don't
vote.
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
me,
what
other
right
do
they
have,
other
than
to
pay
their
dues?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
other
right
do
the
women
have,
other
than
to
pay
dues?
unknown
speaker
that's
understandable.
unknown
speaker
i
was
wondering
if
you
wondered.
unknown
speaker
i
was
wondering
if
you
did
wonder
why
they
didn't
join.
[laughter]
but
in
minnesota,
when
it
was
opened
up,
apparently
women
did
join
in
substantial
numbers.
unknown
speaker
but
suffice
it
to
say,
in
those
organizations
where
the
membership
was
opened
up,
the
women
joined
in
substantial
numbers.
unknown
speaker
in
those
clubs
that
opted
to
open
the
membership
up
to
full
membership
for
women,
women
did
join
in
substantial
numbers.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
as
i
understand
the
state's
attorney,
he's
not
arguing
that
the
state
can
dictate
what
the
jaycees
advocate.
i
didn't
hear
him
to
say
that
at
all.
did
he?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
your
opponent
would
have
said...
would
say
that
his
arguments
all
apply
to
a
situation
where
there
was
something
called
the
national
organization
of
men,
that
it
anti-affirmative
action,
anti-era,
and
so
forth.
i
think
perhaps
he
would
say
the
difference
between
that
case
and
your
case
is,
you
haven't
shown
that
the
jaycees
are
the
counterpart
of
now.
unknown
speaker
you're
basically
asserting
a
first
amendment
right.
and
the
state
is
asserting
a
right
to
eliminate
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
and
sex
in
its
public
accommodations
law.
and
i
guess
you
will
concede
that
the
state
does
have
power
to
regulate
and
prevent
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
and
sex.
unknown
speaker
in
a
public
accommodation.
and
it
has
defined
the
jaycees
as
a
public
accommodation.
so
that
requires
us,
i
suppose,
to
apply
some
kind
of
a
balancing
test
as
in
o'brien
and
see
whether
the
public
interest
and
concern
in
elimination
of
discrimination
is
sufficient
to
uphold
the
regulation.
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
constitutional
analysis
is
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
we
apply
an
o'brien
type
test,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
have
businesses
that
said
we
don't
want
to
serve
blacks.
we
have
a
restaurant
and
we're
not
going
to
serve
blacks.
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
state's
interest
in
eliminating
discrimination
is
enough
to
put
a
stop
to
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
you
have...
you
have
this
kind
of
balancing
to
look
at,
don't
you--
unknown
speaker
--don't
you
think
those
were
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
those
cases?
the
same
argument
you
make.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
associate
together
to
organize
a
training
school
for
young
executives?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
training
school
for
young
executives
which
had
different
projects
and
seminars
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
young
male
executives.
unknown
speaker
you
made
reference
to
the
national
organization
for
women
and
some
of
these
women's
organizations.
i
notice
in
their
brief
that
they
filed
here,
that
there
are
200,000
women
and
men
in
that
organization.
apparently,
they
do
take
in
men.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
i
notice
that
from
exhibit
3,
that
the
jaycees
in
1981
urged
a
constitutional
amendment
requiring
congress
to
balance
the
budget
every
year.
and
in
1983
they
urged
a
constitutional
amendment
to
support
voluntary
prayer
in
american
schools.
now,
are
those
fairly
typical
of
the
types
of
things
that
the
jaycees
do?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
