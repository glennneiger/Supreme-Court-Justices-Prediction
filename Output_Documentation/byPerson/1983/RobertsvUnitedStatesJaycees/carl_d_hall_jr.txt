mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
concerns
in
this
case
have
been
pretty
much
the
same
as
those
expressed
by
the
court
here.
the
united
states
jaycees
is
not
a
business.
it's
a
membership
organization,
substantially
similar
to
hundreds
of
others
in
this
country...
kiwanis,
lions,
and
others.
to
be
specific,
some
of
the
questions
answered,
the
jaycees
is
a
tax-exempt
nonprofit
missouri
corporation.
all
of
the
state
organizations
are
likewise
tax-exempt
corporations,
as
are
the
local
organizations,
and
they
are
all
tax-exempt
as
501(c)(4)
organizations
or
civic
leagues,
and
they
granted
exemption
pursuant
to
a
published
ruling
under
that
category
some
many
years
ago
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
this
organization
has
existed
since
1920
and
is
essentially
the
same
today
as
it
was
then,
in
the
sense
that
its
sole
purpose
is
to
promote
the
interest
of
men.
it's
a
young
men's
organization.
its
purpose
is
to...
essentially
to
assist
young
men
in
their
development
by
means
of
community
service.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
no,
it's
not
young
businessmen?
it's
any
young
men.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
right.
any
young
man
between
the
ages--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--young
school
teachers,
young
doctors,
young
lawyers,
young
preachers,
anyone
who
wants
the
organization
can
join
and
receive
the
benefits.
the
essential
objective
of
the
organization
is
to
develop
young
men
through
participation
in
community
projects.
these
projects
vary
by
the
thousands.
they
are
essentially
developed
by
the
local
organization
itself.
the
national
organization
does
develop
programs,
but
essentially
most
of
the
programs
are
developed
locally.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
i
can't
think
of
any
program
that
would.
i
think...
i
cannot.
i
think
where
the
problem
comes
in,
the
statement
has
been
made
that
if
women
are
admitted,
it
won't
really
change
the
organization
or
its
views.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
it
could
very
well.
the
programs
are...
in
terms
of
local
programs...
are
by
the
thousands.
i
don't
think
the
programs
would
change
so
much
as
it
would
the
interest
advanced.
the
interest
advanced
by
the
organization
is
that
of
young
men.
and,
presumably,
any
organization
which
admits
women
as
voting
members,
in
due
time
its--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--as
i
said
earlier,
i
don't
know
of
any
external
program
in
that
sense.
the
program
which
you--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--it
would
indeed.
it
would
indeed
change
the
internal,
because
the
internal
programs
are
directed
to
the
self-improvement
of
just
young
men.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
and
it
has...
and
although
the
organization
has
voted
three
times
on
this
question,
the
membership
has
still
indicated
they
desire
the
organization
to
continue
as
an
organization
to
advance
the
interests
of
young
men.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
of
the
majority
of...
they
voted
three
times
and,
of
course,
the
majority
voted
all
three
times.
and
the
reasons,
of
course,
could
be
varied
as
there
are
people
voting,
but
essentially
the
thrust
has
always
been
that
the
young
men
want
an
organization
which
promotes
the
interests
of
young
men.
women
have
organizations--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--i
think
the
desire
of
young
men
simply
to
have
an
organization
that
they
entirely
run
and
promotes
solely
their
interest.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
no.
the
first
amendment,
as
we
understand
it,
would
protect
the
interests
of
any
group
who
desires
to
meet
and
associate
for
the
purpose--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--this
organization...
we
would
advance
that,
but
in
this
case
it's
more
than
that.
in
this
case--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--no,
it's
communications
would
not.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well,
the...
as
pointed
out
earlier,
in
the
number
of
matters
which
the
organization
votes
on
not
only
nationally,
but
locally,
each
year
number
in
the
hundreds.
the
national
itself
takes
a
vote
each
year
on
various
issues,
but
all
the
6,000
organizations
also,
from
time
to
time,
take
public
positions
on
issues
of
local
community--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
i
can't
think
of
a
public
commitment
issue
which
is
applied
only
to
men,
but
i
can
foresee
that
the
organization
itself,
if
they
take
a
vote
on
era
or
the
draft
or
abortion,
or
any
of
those
sensitive
issues,
they
could
very
well
take
a
different
position.
there
are...
i
think
it's
not
rational--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not
taken
a
vote
on
those
sensitive
issues,
but
they
certainly
are
going
to.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
no.
i
think
the
interest
is
that
they
have--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
about
interest
in
women--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes,
i
will.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
it
is
our
position
that
the
jaycees
is
not
a
business;
it's
a
bona
fide
membership
organization
like
the
thousands
of
others.
its
members
elect
its
officers,
control
its
affairs,
determine
its
course
of
action,
make
up
its
budget,
determine
exactly
where
it
will
go.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
there
is
no...
well,
it
does
not
sell
memberships.
it
recruits
memberships
in
the
sense
that
of
membership
organization.
it
no
more
sells
memberships
than
the
rotary
or
kiwanis
or
any
other
women's
organization,
junior
league
or
any
other,
sells
memberships.
all
of
those
organizations
recruit
new
people
and
they
issue
members
in
return
for
dues.
the
jaycees
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
up,
pretty
much,
to
the
local
chapter
itself.
age
18
to
35
are
eligible.
how
that
local
chapter
would
go
about
it
would
be
pretty
much
left
up
to
the
local
chapter
itself.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that
is
possible,
if
you're
18
to
35.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
organization,
to
promote
young
men,
and
they
could.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
in
this
case,
there
could
be
also...
local
people
could
be
excluded
on
a
de
facto
basis
likewise,
and
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
no.
the--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--yes.
i
think
you
have
the
power
to
analyze
the
facts
in
making
the
constitutional
inquiry
as
to
whether
this
organization's
right
to
free
association
has
been--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--well,
if
that
were
accepted,
we
would
abridge
constitutional
rights
by
just
pure
imposition
of
labels.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--our
point
is
the
same
as
judge
arnold
made,
that
the
label
"business"
is
simply
a
distortion
of
the
facts.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
but...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
your
question.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
i'm
not
quarreling
that
the
last
word
on
whether
or
not
they
label
this
a
public...
that
label,
they
are
the
last
word.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
that
label
does
not
preclude
the
constitutional
analysis.
that's
the
point
we're
making.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
the
organization
does
have
a
wide
admission
policies
of
young
men
18
to
35.
our
position
is
that
does
not
take
away
our
right
to
free
association.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
that
is
true,
except
for
de
facto
exclusion
on
a
local
basis
where
people
tend
to
admit
people
and
recruit
people,
as
in
st.
paul,
where
they're
primarily
business.
but
in
new
orleans
it
may
be
another
way,
and
in
los
angeles
it
may
be
another,
where
people
tend
to
recruit
people
they
have
something
in
common
with.
but
it
is
true
that
it
does
not
have
an
exquisite
or
exclusive
method
of
recruitment.
however,
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
dealt
with
the
right
of
freedom
association,
to
my
knowledge,
none
of
those
cases
have
dealt
with
organizations
that
have
had
highly
selective
or
private
club
membership
policies.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
cases
that
we
have
seen
that
indicate
that
an
organization
with
this
kind
of
a
policy
could
not
enjoy
that
freedom.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
although
in
this
case,
there
is
broad
communication
of
controversial
public
issues.
in
this
case,
the--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--i
can't
identify...
if
the
organization
itself,
it
were
required
to
comply
with
the
minnesota
injunction
and
admit
women,
it
is
inconceivable...
and
i
think
you're
rational
to
assume
that
the
organization
won't
change
and
that
its
viewpoint
won't
change.
anytime
the
membership--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--abortion.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well,
they've
never
voted
on
it,
but
i
can't
predict
the
issues--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--i
can't
predict
what
the
viewpoint
will
be
on
any
given
issue
that
may
come
up
next
year
or
the
year
after
that.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
i
think
an
organization
in
which
you
change
the
membership
from
one
which
is
all
men,
dedicated
to
voting
the
interests
of
men,
and
you
change
it
to
an
organization
which
also
includes
women,
i
think
it's
only
rational
to
assume
that
that
organization
is
going
to
undergo
a
substantial
change.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well,
the
important
point
that
i
think
perhaps
i
haven't
made
clear
is
that
this
organization's
essential
core
purpose
is
to
advance
the
interests
of
young
men,
just
as
there
are
women's
organizations
which
central
core
purpose
is
to
advance
women.
if
you
would
require
those
women's
organizations
to
admit
men,
you're
going
to
change
the
organization.
if
you
require
this
organization
to
admit
women,
i
think
it's
inevitable
that
you're
going
to
essentially
change
it.
i
think
we
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
organization
which
just
promotes
the
interests
of
young
men.
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
expect
that
if
it
becomes
an
orgnanization
in
which
women
are
members,
that
they're
going
to
long
stand
for
leaving
the
organization
with
the
sole
purpose
to
advance
the
interests
of
men.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
maybe
that...
that
may
be
a...
judge
doyle
of
the
tenth
circuit
suggested
that
may
be
a
possible
fear,
and
if
it
is,
i
think
it's
the
kind
of
fear
that
would
be
legitimately
protected
by
any
group.
women
may
keep
out
men
for
fear
they'll
take
over.
i
think
it's
a
legitimate
right
to
do
so.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
right.
and
i
think
if
women
had
been
in
this
organization
five
years
ago
or
even
six
years
ago,
they
would
not
have
been
willing
to
spend
the
kind
of
money
this
organization
is
spending
to
uphold
its
constitutional
right
to
be
a
men-only
organization.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes,
it
will.
there...
in
exhibit
19,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
list...
a
long
list
of
positions
taken
on
critical
controversial
issues
by
the
local
organizations.
in
addition
to
that,
in
i
think
it's
exhibit
3,
there
is
also
a
long
list
of
positions
which
the
organization
has
taken
over
the
years.
they've
taken
the...
the
record
itself
reveals
many
positions
since
1956.
actually,
they
were
taking
them
even
before
that.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
they're
in
the
record.
both
of
those
exhibits
are
in
the
record
before
the
district--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
true.
but
the
taking
of
positions
on
various
issues
is
only
one
part
of
the
way
in
which
young
men
are
developed.
young
men
are
developed
in
this
organization
not
just
by
taking
positions
on
issues;
that's
only
a
part
of
it.
young
men
are
developed
primarily
by
running
projects
which,
in
turn,
benefit
the
community,
whether
it's
the
hartford
open
or
the
patty
berg
classic,
or
whether
it's--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--that's
right.
that's
correct.
and
being
officers
and
directors
of
those
groups.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
and
they
learn
by
doing.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
if
women
did
it,
they
could
benefit
from
it.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
the
associate
members
do
participate
in
these
programs.
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
vote
or
control
policy
of
the
organization.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
they
do
not
serve
as
officers,
but
the
associate
members
have
run
projects,
yes.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
and
do
not
vote
or
hold
office.
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
this
is
a
voluntary
organization,
justice
marshall,
and
the
women
don't
have
to
join
on
that
basis.
and
they
are
a
very
small
group.
the
number
of
associate
members
is
very
small
at
this
time.
it's
about
9,000,
and
only
a
small
portion
of
that
are
women
associate
members.
women
have
not
joined
in
large
droves
as
associate
members.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
and
i
don't
blame
them
for
that,
and
that's
their
choice
to
make--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
either...
that
was
primarily
in
violation
of
the
bylaws.
as
i
recall,
minnesota
did
not
adopt
any
program,
and
that
was
just
a
flat
violation
of
bylaws,
and
that's
how
we
got--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
did
join
in
substantial
numbers.
the
point
we
make
here
is
that
if...
no
one
would,
i
think,
urge
that
now
or
any
other
active
organization,
that
the
state
would
have
the
right
to
dictate
what
that
organization
advocates.
and
yet,
in
this
particular
case,
by
dictating
the
composition
of
its
membership--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--no,
he
doesn't.
but
he
arrives
at
the
same
conclusion
by
dictating
who
the
membership,
and
by
dictating
the
membership
you
effectively
determine
how
that
organization
will...
its
collective
voice
and
its
programs.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
it
seems
irrational
to
assume
that
this
organization,
to
continue
as
an
all-male
organization,
has
to
deliberately
take
positions
on
era
or
abortion
in
order
to
show
how
anti-woman
it
is.
it
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense
that
they
can't
have
an
all-male
organization.
there
are
all-women
organizations,
and
i
think
they're
accepted.
someome
asked,
will
this
affect
the
girl
scouts
or
the
boy
scouts?
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question.
it
has
already...
the
trend
of
this
kind
of
litigation
has
already
affected
the
boy
scouts
in
california.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
in
a
public
accommodation.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
no.
i
don't
concede
that
it's
a
balancing
function
at
all.
the
label
"public
accommodation"
which
they
placed
on
the
jaycees,
in
which
that
state
law
determination
is
final,
that
that
does
not
foreclose
the
necessary
constitutional
analysis
to
see
if
the
jaycees...
the
right--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--you
would
apply
the
test
of
griswold
v.
connecticut
and
shelton
v.
tucker
and
other
cases
which
have
set
forth
the
basic
fundamental
right
of
freedom
of
association
to
choose
our
own
members.
that's
the
test
that
we
would
apply.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes,
but--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--well,
the
two
situations
are
not
comparable.
in
the
case
of
the
traditional
public
accommodation...
the
restaurant,
the
theater,
the
motel,
and
so
forth...
those
do
not
have
private
associational
characteristics.
those,
in
fact...
sharing
a
plate
of
food
in
a
restaurant
doesn't
have
any
private
associational
characteristics.
that's
much
different
than
the
local
jaycee
organization,
which
many
of
them
have
anywhere...
a
minimum
of
20
to--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--in
the
public
accommodation
cases,
the
right
of
freedom
of
association
was
not
made,
to
my
knowledge,
because
they
were
no
private
associational
characteristics
involved
in
a
restaurant
or
a
motel,
as
distinguished
from
this
case
where
a
local
jaycee
organization
of
20
or
30
or
40
or
50
young
men
associate
together
on
week-to-week
basis.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
beg
pardon?
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
training
school
for
young
executives,
in
the
context
now
of
a
commercial
enterprise--
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
--yes.
young
male
executives
in
the
context
of
a
commercial
enterprise,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
public
accommodation.
they'd
have
to
admit
women.
back
to
the
earlier
question,
the
jaycees
is
simply
not
a
business.
it
does
not...
it's
a
nonprofit
organization,
and
does
not
have
the
characteristics
of
a
business.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
as
to
those
organizations,
the
problem
of
admitting
anyone
to
interfere
with
their
fundamental
underlying
purpose
has
not
been
a
problem.
some
of
the
organizations
who
have
filed
as
amicus
here,
however,
do
limit
their
membership
to
women,
and
legitimately
so,
because
those
organizations
feel
that
they're
promoting
the
interests
of
women,
and
if
they
want
to
do
that
they
should
limit
their
organization
to
women.
there
are
large
organizations
in
this
country
which
do
limit
their
memberships
strictly
to
women
for
the
sole
purpose
of
advancing
the
interests
of
women.
mr.
carl
d.
hall,
jr.
yes.
that's
of...
typical
in
terms
of
the
national
positions
they
will
take.
the
local
positions
by
local
organizations
would
be
much
more
tied
to
local
bond
issues,
to
local
problems
of
local
and
state
interest.
one
further
question
i'd
like
to
address,
and
that's
the
question
of
vagueness.
presumably,
in
this
case,
if
the
jaycees
have
a
desire
to
comply
with
this
statute
in
any
way,
the
question
is
how
could
the
bylaws
be
amended?
they
meet
each
and
every
june,
and
could
amend
the
bylaws
in
any
way
that
the
membership
chose
to
do
so.
now,
we
submit
that
not
only
is
it
impossible
for
an
ordinary
individual
to
know
how
to
amend
the
bylaws
in
this
case
to
comply
with
minnesota's
law
so
as
to
be
like
the
kiwanis,
that
i
submit
it
would
even
be
literally
impossible
for
the
average,
ordinary,
intelligent
lawyer
to
amend
the
jaycees
bylaws
to
comply
with
it
in
order
to
be
more
a
private
organization
like
the
kiwanis,
as
distinguished
from
a
public
organization
like
the
jaycees.
thank
you.
