mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
a
brief
explanation
of
the
nature
of
west
virginia's
business
and
occupation
privilege
tax
system
will
help
clarify
the
issues
raised
in
this
appeal.
west
virginia's
tax
is
a
typical
privilege
tax
levied
upon
engaging
within
the
state
in
certain
business
activities,
and
interstate
when
it
is
applied
to
an
interstate
activity,
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
the
in-state
aspects
of
that
activity.
the
measure
of
the
tax,
however,
is
the
full
gross
proceeds
from
the
completed
business.
the
subject
of
the
tax
at
issue
in
this
appeal
is
the
business
of
selling
and
not
the
sale
itself.
selling
activities
taking
place
within
west
virginia
are
the
taxable
incident.
in
form,
the
west
virginia
business
and
occupation
selling
tax
is
virtually
identical
to
the
state
of
washington's
tax
levied
in
general
motors
v.
washington
and
in
the
standard
pressed
steel
case.
i
would
like
to
briefly
review
armco's
in-state
activities--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
about
the
rates
or
the
taxes
involved.
the
tax
was
levied
on
engaging
within
the
business
or
within
the
state
in
the
business
of
selling
in
both...
in
both
instances.
i
would
like
to
review
armco's
in-state
activity
for
a
moment.
armco's,
as
discussed,
business
activities
are
divided
into...
on
a
divisional
basis
with
each
division
making
products
and
selling
only
the
products
made
by
that
division.
armco's
steel
division
employed
four
salesmen
within
west
virginia,
two
each
from
its
pittsburgh
and
cincinnati
offices.
such
salesmen
systematically
and
repetitively
covered
the
state
of
west
virginia
soliciting
business.
the
salesmen
were
within
the
state
on
an
average
of
once
every
four
to
six
weeks
with
one
salesman
making
as
much
as
two
monthly
visits.
the
duration
of
the
salesmen's
in-state
solicitation
activities
is
not
in
the
record.
it
could
have
been
only
one
day,
or
it
could
have
been
as
long
as
two
weeks.
it's
just
simply
not
stated.
the
in-state
activities
of
the
steel
division
were
described
by
armco's
witness,
mr.
geary,
the
cincinnati
district's
sales...
the
cincinnati
district
sales
manager.
i'd
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
clear
up
a
misunderstanding
which
has
resulted
from
mr.
geary's
testimony.
mr.
geary
stated
that
in
1976,
77
percent
of
the
sales
to
west
virginia
customers
from
his
office,
the
cincinnati
district
of
the
steel
division,
were
solicited
outside
of
west
virginia.
mr.
geary
did
note
that
even
those
sales
did
have
some
in-state
aspects
such
as
coming
in
into
the
state
to
investigate
complaints
associated
with
the
sales
and
servicing
of
the
accounts.
the
circuit
court,
which
is
not
the
finder
of
fact
in
tax
appeal
cases
in
west
virginia,
misinterpreted
mr.
geary's
testimony
and
concluded
that
77
percent
of
all
of
armco's
sales
at
issue
from
all
of
its
divisions
were
solicited
outside
of
the
state.
we
believe
that
conclusion
to
be
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we...
we
are
focusing
upon
the
solicitation
activities
themselves
primarily
as
providing
the
nexus
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
oh,
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
activities
associated
with
procuring
the
sales.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we
would.
i
believe
in
that
circumstance
if
only
all
there
was
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
was
delivery
that
we
would
not
tax
it.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
believe
we
would,
your
honor.
we--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
we
simply...
we
feel
like
norton
was...
was
decided
long
enough...
along
those
lines.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
think
norton
can
be
distinguished
in
this
matter.
i
think
norton
dealt
with
a
situation
of
whether
an
interstate
activity
was
significantly
or
directly
associated
with
an
intrastate
activity,
and
at
that
point
and
at
that
time
it
had
to
be
in
order
to
be
taxable.
however,
now
since
interstate
commerce
can
be
directly
taxed,
i
feel
that
that
aspect
of
norton
is
no
longer
practical.
i
feel
norton--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--no.
i
feel
norton
is
good
law
as
with
respect
to
mr.
dailey's
hypothet
in
which
west
virginia
would
attempt
to
tax
sales
in
the
state
of
indiana.
certainly
if
there
are
no
in-state
selling
aspects,
due
process
requirements
of
norton
would
preclude
the
taxing--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
don't
think
norton
would
have
addressed
the
same
issue.
norton...
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
was
associated
with
an
in-state
activity
wouldn't
have
been
relevant.
if
this
court...
this
court
may
look
at
it
as
to
whether
that...
the
activities
in
norton
were
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
factual
distinctions
between
this
instance
and
norton.
norton
dealt
with
only
mail
order
sales,
in
the
first
order.
they
did,
however,
in
the
dicta
of
the
case
discuss
the
mccloud
case,
and
in
that
case
mccloud
stated
that
purely
itinerant
drummers,
if
that
was
the
only
activity
within
the
state,
would
not
afford
the
jurisdiction
to
tax.
however,
we
feel
that
in
this
case
there
is
something
above
and
beyond
that;
that
this
solicitation
is
a
repetitive,
continuous
type
of
solicitation.
and...
i'll
get
into
it
in
a
moment...
we
also
feel
that
there
is
something
above
and
beyond
just
pure
solicitation,
and
in
that
respect
we
do
rely
to
some
extent
on
the
full
scope
of
armco's
activities
within
west
virginia.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
none,
your
honor.
none
of
the
individuals
involved
in
the
solicitation
of
the
sales
at
issue.
armco
did
have
resident
salesmen
but
of
another
division.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
those
also
were...
were
involved
in
the
state.
however
we--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--they
did,
your
honor,
but
of
course,
their
sales
to
ultimate
customers
would
have
been
independently
taxed.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
so
that's
not...
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
but
to
review
again
on
the
77
percent
basis,
as
i
said,
we
feel
that
the
solicitation
aspects
are
a
significant
part
of
the
business
of
selling
in
this
case.
and
we
feel
the
record
plainly
demonstrates
that
that
77
percent
figure
which
has
been
presented
to
this
court
is
inaccurate;
that
it
only
applied
to
the
sales
of
the
cincinnati
office,
and
it
only
applied
to
the
1976
year.
and
since
1976
was
outside
the
audit
period,
that
estimation
isn't
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
administrative
decision
is
the
proper
factfinder
and
that
the
decision
found
simply
that
armco
did
not
offer
any
evidence
to
support
any
conclusion
other
than
that
the
sales
at
issue
were
prompted
by
in-state
solicitation.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
you
should
not
accept
what
the
circuit
court...
i
think
it
was
a
clear
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
at
hand.
and
by
examination
of
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
that
that
will
clearly
come
out.
mr.
geary
also
testified
regarding
union
wire
rope
divisions
of
armco's
and
their
activities
within
the
state.
they
were
again
similar
to
the
steel
divisions.
three
salesmen
operating
from
pittsburgh,
ashland
and
greensboro,
north
carolina
solicited
business
within
the
state
on
an
average
of
once
or
twice
a
month.
again,
the
duration
of
their
visits
is
omitted
from
the
record.
armco's
metal
products
division
during
the
audit
period
maintained
an
office
in
south
charleston,
west
virginia
from
which
two
salesman
conducted
selling
activities
statewide.
they
sold
all
of
the
products
of
the
metal
products
division
except
metal
buildings,
which
were
handled
by
franchise
agents.
mr.
geary's
testimony
plainly
establishes
that
with
regard
to
all
of
the
salesmen
of
all
of
the
divisions
sent
into
west
virginia,
they
were
sent
in
for
the
purpose
of
getting
business.
and
we
contend
that
that
would
necessarily
include
determination
of
a
customer's
wants
and
needs,
to
some
extent
were
customized
products
made
for
special
uses
for
the
customers,
checking
customer
satisfaction
with
previous
orders,
and
soliciting
future
business.
the
state
of
west
virginia
submits
that
armco,
pursuant
to
such
activities,
clearly
was
engaging
in
the
business
of
selling
in
west
virginia,
and
that
such
activities
furnished
the
state
sufficient
nexus
for
their
taxation.
armco
does
not
contend
that
its
business
activities
do
not
constitute
engaging
in
the
business
of
selling.
however,
they
feel
that
those
activities,
like
in
standard
pressed
steel,
are
too
thin
and
inconsequential
to
satisfy
constitutional
nexus
tests.
naturally,
the
state
of
west
virginia
disagrees
with
that
proposition.
we
feel
that
this
court's
decisions
have
clearly
held
that
the
business
of
selling's
taxable
event
to
be
those
activities
resulting
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
the
sales
taxed.
in
the
general
motors
case
versus
washington,
the
operating
incidence
of
the
selling
privilege
was
held
to
be
taxable
activities
resulting
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
sales
and
those
which
make
possible
the
continuance
of
valuable
contractual
relations.
similarly,
in
standard
pressed
steel,
the
business
of
selling
was
viewed
as
those
activities
which
wake
possible
the
realization
and
continuance
of
valuable
contractual
relationships.
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
in
both
instances
solicitation
activities
were
the
most
significant
aspect
of
the
business
of
selling,
and
where
they
occurred
evidenced
where
the
location
or
where
the
state
that
had
the
jurisdiction
to
tax.
the
state
of
west
virginia
submits
that
armco
solicitation
activities
were
the
taxable
event
of
their
selling
operations,
and
since
such
solicitation
activities
occurred
in
west
virginia,
nexus
is
clearly
supplied.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
we
feel
like...
we
feel,
your
honor,
that...
that
there
has
to
be
some
activity.
this
is
a
privilege
tax
on
the
business
of
selling
and
not
on
the
sale
itself.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
we
feel
that
due
process
requires
some
minimal
activity
relating
to
the
taxable--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--well,
the
sale,
your
honor,
technically
could
occur
outside
of
the
state,
transfer
of
title
could
occur
outside
of
the
state,
acceptance
of
the
order
could
occur
outside
of
the
state.
so
just
simply
the
fact
that
a
west
virginia
resident
consumed
the
product
i
don't
think
would
be
sufficient.
i
think--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--just
on
general
due
process
laws,
your
honor.
i
just...
our
concept
of
what
the
constitutional
nexus
requirements
are.
we
feel
that
the
activity
must
be--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
think,
as
i
set
out
in
my
brief,
that
i,
at
least
personally,
believe
that
norton
was...
was
designed
for
a
different
question
than
is
involved
here.
and
still,
though,
i
believe
that
norton
can
be...
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case;
and
to
find
that
west...
that
the
appellant...
or
armco's
activities
within
west
virginia
are
sufficient
for
their
taxation
i
think
can
be
done
without
overruling
norton.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
address
that
in
full
in
a
moment.
but
in
basically
one
of
two
ways
we
feel
that
our
court
was...
was
correct
or
justifiable
in...
in
looking
at
least...
i
don't
know
if
you
want
to
term
it
the
unitary
concept,
at
least
possibly
a
form
of
the
unitary
concept,
at
the
full
scope
of
armco's
activities
within
west
virginia.
first
of
all,
we
feel
like
the
full
scope
of
activities
within
the
state
meets
certain
compliance
problems
that
may
have
been
the
basis
of
the
requirement
of
a
fixed
presence.
and
secondly,
we
feel
that
nexus
is
a
fact-bound
or...
is
a
fact-bound
problem,
and
we
believe
that
in
certain
factual
circumstances
such
as
the
general
motors
case
where
activities
of
the
taxpayer
are
so
mingled
that
it's
impossible
to
determine
which
activity
did
result
in
that
sale,
then
only
by
looking
at
the
bundle
of
corporate
activity
can...
can
you
determine
whether
there
is
sufficient
nexus.
however--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we
do.
i
believe
that
the
solicitation
activities
in
and
of
themselves
more
than
satisfy
the
nexus
requirement.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i...
i...
i
don't
believe
that
you
should,
your
honor.
and
as
i
said
in
this,
i
don't
feel
that
it's
necessary.
the--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
believe...
the...
the
general
motors
case
has
been
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
unitary
concept
in
other
cases.
i
don't
quite
to
this
point
understand
exactly
in
what
context
that
was
used.
however,
i
feel
like
that
the
entire
business
activities
of
the
taxpayer
in...
in
general
motors
were
looked
at
in
order
to...
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
sufficient
nexus
existed,
and
as
such,
more
than
just
the
activities
associated
with
specific
sales
was
held
to
be
the
taxable...
to...
to
provide
taxable
nexus.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
an
extension
of
this,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
particularly
warranted
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
physical
presence,
the
face-to-face
relationship
that's
been
evidenced,
this
continuous,
repetitive
solicitation
is
far
different
than
placing
an
ad.
and
it
satisfies
the...
the
minimal
process
that
the
person,
property
or
activity,
at
least
a
portion
thereof,
occur
in
the
state.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
discrimination
portion
of
the...
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
as
to
whether
or
not
nexus
is
supplied?
no,
your
honor,
i...
it's
not
within--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
well,
i
believe
in
the
national
geographic
case
that
this
court
perhaps
has
stated
that...
that
was
is
right
in
a...
in
a
sales
and
use
tax
setting
may
not
be
correct
in
a
gross
proceeds
privilege
tax.
if
the
court
would
want
to
extend
that
principle,
certainly
the
state
of
west
virginia
would
be
in
favor
of
it.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
not
apply.
they
would
not
be
engaging
within
the
business
of
selling
in
the
state.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
feel
that
there
might
be
a
due
process
constitutional
nexus
difference.
to
sum
up,
i
believe
that
armco's
systematic
and
repetitive
solicitation
activities
were
essential
to
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
its
sales
to
west
virginia
customers,
and
the
sales
at
issue,
at
least
at
the
levels
made,
would
not
have
existed
but
for
armco's
activities
within
west
virginia.
i
believe
the
only
difference
between
this
case
and
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
standard
pressed
steel
case
is
the
lack
of
a
fixed,
purely
local
aspect
of
the
sales
upon
which
to
base
the
tax.
the
state
of
west
virginia
believes
that
the
lack
of
such
a
permanent
local
activity
should
not
be
controlling
in
this
case.
the
local
activity
requirement
can
be
traced
to
the
norton
and
mccloud
cases,
as...
as
we
discussed.
such
cases
held
that
solicitation
activities
by
themselves
did
not
provide
the
local
grip
on
the
seller
sufficient
to
bring
the
taxation
within
the
state's
power...
bring
the
activity
within
the
state's
taxing
power.
the
state
of
west
virginia
submits
that
a
re-evaluation
of
this
fixed
presence
principle
is
called
for
in
light
of
intervening
decisions.
complete
auto
transit
v.
brady
announced
this
court's
intention
to
judge
state
taxes'
validity
according
to
their
practical
economic
effects,
and
the
appellee
submits
that
in
practical
terms
solicitation
activities
supply
the
same
nexus
as
does
an
in-state
sales
operation.
in
his
dissent
in
the
mccloud
case,
justice
rutledge
stated
that
"regular,
continuous,
persistent
solicitation
has
the
same
economic
and
should
have
the
same
legal
consequences
as
does
maintaining
an
office
for
soliciting
or
even
maintaining
a
place
of
business
where
goods
are
shipped
for
delivery
to
the
buyer.
"
west
virginia
believes
that
justice
rutledge's
observation
is
consistent
and
accurate
with
modern
economic
realities.
this
court
should
examine
the
results
of
armco's
in-state
sales
activities
and
not
where
their
personnel
reside.
west
virginia
also
believes
that
this
court's
elimination
of
the
direct
versus
indirect
distinction
with
regard
to
privileged
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
also
plainly
supports
their
position
that
the
solicitation
activities
by
themselves
can
supply
the
nexus
necessary
to
tax.
in
the
washington
stevedoring
case,
this
court
held
that
since
interstate
commerce
was
subject
to
direct
taxation,
an
activity
which
was
essentially
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
could
supply
the
nexus
necessary
for
its
taxation.
we
believe
that
the
same
logic
is
equally
applicable
to
solicitation
activities.
those
such
activities
are
essentially
a
part
of
interstate
commerce.
their
local
aspects
should
be
viewed
to
determine
whether
the
nexus
necessary
is
supplied.
it
is,
therefore,
appellee's
position
that
armco's
in-state
solicitation
activities,
which
are
essential
to
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
its
sales
to
west
virginia
customers,
furnish
the
constitutional
nexus
to
justify
the
state
of
west
virginia's
taxation.
if,
however,
this
court
feels
that
in
addition
to
solicitation
activities
a
fixed
local
presence
is
required,
the
appellee
believes
that
such
requirement
is
met
in
this
case.
west
virginia
contends
that
the
local
presence
requirement
was
based
upon
the
court's
recognition
of
possible
compliance
costs
burdens
which
could
discourage
interstate
commerce.
small
businesses
who
only
solicit
within
a
state
might
withdraw
such
solicitation
if
compliance
costs
outweighed
potential
profits.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
the
local
manufacturer
in
west
virginia
would
only
pay
the
manufacturing
tax,
and
if
he
sold
out
of
state,
he
would
be
subject
to
whatever
tax
the
other
states--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--similar
system.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
don't...
i
don't
follow
your
honor's
question
too
well.
i
think
that
west
virginia's
only
trying
to
tax
the
manufacturing
activity
within
their
state.
i
don't
believe
that
the--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
would
be.
i...
i
think--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that's
a
type
of
discrimination
that
this
court
has
determined
to
be...
to
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
think
that
that
is
only
potential.
we...
we
don't
know...
very
few
states
have
a
gross
receipts
tax
system
such
as
west
virginia's.
the
fact
that
they
may
possibly
be
subject
to
a...
to
a
selling
tax
in
another
state
is
beyond
the
control
of
the
state
of
west
virginia.
and
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
henneford
case
long
ago
established
that
we
didn't
have
to
establish
our
tax
system
in
response
to
the
possibilities
of
other
tax
systems.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
certain
that...
that
again
that's
the
type
of
discrimination
that
this
court...
this
court
has
found
to
be
improper
under
the
commerce
clause.
in
the
henneford
case
again--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--in
effect,
if
that
hypothetical
situation
existed,
then
an
in-state--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
a
different
treatment...
to
the
extent
that
any
different
treatment
is
discriminatory,
i
agree
it's
discriminatory.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
first
of
all,
as
i
said,
in
the
henneford
case
there
the
same
situation
was
presented
in
which
one
commodity
could
be
subject
to
both
a
sales
and
use
tax.
since
it
wasn't,
this
court
refrained
from
determining
whether
or
not
that
multiple
taxation
would
be
discriminatory.
however,
the
language
clearly
said
that...
that
this
court
was
not
sure
that
that
type
of
activity
would
be
discriminatory,
but
it
was
going
to
wait
until
that...
that
situation
presented
itself
actually
before
it
was
going
to
make
that...
make
that
determination.
i
think
that
that's
what's
called
for
in
this
case.
the
state
of
washington
has,
as
i
stated,
a
privilege
tax
system
virtually
identical
to
west
virginia's,
and
its
system
of
credits
in
that
state
brings
about
a
practical
effect
which
is
virtually
identical
to
the...
to
the
effect
discussed
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
system.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
certainly
it
would.
we
would
then
be
enticing
people
to
come
into
the
state
to
perform
a
manufacturing
activity
and,
in
effect,
lowering
their
total
tax
burden.
we're
not
doing
that.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
cases
such
as
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
and
the
maryland
v.
louisiana
case
that,
in
effect,
the...
the
total
tax
burden
in
a
dollars
and
cents
fashion
was...
was
the
controlling
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
was
my...
my
point
about
the
washington
state
tax.
their
practical
effect
of
their
tax
is
the
same
as
west
virginia's.
rather
than
exempting
the
wholesale
sale
of
taxes
that
have
already
been
paid
under
manufacturing,
the--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--again,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
a
discriminatory
pattern,
because
we
would
entice
people
to
come
into...
through
the
use
of
the
wholesale
sales
exemption
we
would
entice
people
to
come
in
the
state
and
perform
more
business
activities
and,
in
effect--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--twenty-one
percent
i
would...
26
percent
in
this.
no,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that's...
that
as
long
as
they
could
come
into
the
state
and
receive
no
less
of
a
tax
burden,
then
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
any...
any
influence
upon
them
to
withdraw
an
interstate
activity
and
make
it
a
purely
intrastate
activity.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
exactly.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
compensate
in
the
manner
it
wishes
and
to
compensate
for
sales
actually
made
in
west
virginia,
to
note
that
that
is
part
of
the
manufacturing
process
is
the
sale
of
the
product,
and
to
compensate
for
an
actual
burden
imposed
by
west
virginia
law
and
choose
not
to
compensate
for
a
potential
burden
out
of
state.
and
i
don't
think
that
that...
that's
an
improper
handling
of
the
situation.
however,
again
back
to
the
state
of
washington,
as...
as
you
said,
it's
the
interaction
between
the
two
taxes.
in
the
state
of
washington
you
would
have
the
exact
same
interaction.
a
person
who
manufactures
in
washington
does
not
have
to
pay
a
manufacturing
tax
if
he
pays
the
wholesale
sales
tax.
so,
in
effect,
in
a
hypothetical
situation
described
by
armco,
if
an
individual
was
paying
an
out-of-state
manufacturing
tax
and
then
was...
and
sold
his
goods
in
either
the
state
of
washington
or
the
state
of
west
virginia,
he
would
be
subject
to
tax
under
two
privileges,
whereas
the
in-state
manufacturer-wholesaler
would
only
be
subject
to
tax
under
one
privilege.
it's
the
exact
same
question.
this
court
examined
that
situation
in
both
the
standard
pressed
steel
and
the
general
motors
cases
and
determined
that
no
multiple
burden
actually
did
exist,
and
therefore,
that
this
court
was
not
going
to...
not
going
to
examine
that
issue
until
an
actual
multiple
burden
was...
was
shown.
and,
again,
armco's
situation
is
entirely
hypothetical.
they...
they
don't
pay
any
taxes
in
the
state
of
ohio
on
the
manufacture
of
this
product;
and
so
their
situation
is
just
hypothetical
and
one
that
this
court
should
not
address
at
this
time
to--
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
--i
think
that
that's...
under...
under
the
caskey
case
it's
a
type
of
compensating
tax,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
compensation,
again,
could
be
upset
by
the
fact
that
hypothetically
someone
outside
the
state
may
have
to
pay
another
case
on
it.
but,
again,
i
don't...
i
don't
see...
see
the
relevance
of
this
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
if
it...
if...
if
that
was...
were
the
case
and
that
was
shown,
no,
then
that
would
not
be
irrelevant.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
it
depends
on
whether
the
taxpayer
before
this
court
can
show
an
actual
multiple
burden.
mr.
robert
digges,
jr.
well,
again,
your
honor,
i...
i...
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
the
type
of
discrimination
that
this
court...
this
court
has...
has
outlawed.
as
i
said
in
the
henneford
case,
the
sales
versus
use
distinction
was
that...
that
possibly
because
it
would
be
subject
to
two
taxes,
whereas
a
purely
in-state
activity
would
only
be
subject
to
one,
the
court
said
that
that
necessarily
wasn't
a
type
of
discrimination.
in
several
of
this
court's
decisions
they've
said
that
the
vagaries
of
one
state's
taxing
scheme
will
not
be
forced
to
concede
to
another's,
such
as
the...
i
believe
the
mobil
oil
case
in
which
it
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
had
the
right
to
tax
the
dividends,
all
of
the
dividends,
whereas
there
was
an
apportionment
problem.
again,
this
court
said
well,
that
may
be
the
case,
but
it's
not
shown
here,
and
one
system
shouldn't
necessarily
have
to...
have
to...
have
to
take
into
recognition
what
other
states
are
doing.
thank
you,
your
honor.
