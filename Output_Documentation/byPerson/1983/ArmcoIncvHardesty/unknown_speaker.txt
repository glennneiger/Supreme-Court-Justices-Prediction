unknown
speaker
mr.
dailey,
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
sometime
in
your
argument
you
could
describe
with
perhaps
some
particularity
exactly
what
transactions
of
armco
west
virginia
seeks
to
tax
here.
as
i
understand
it,
they're
not
trying
to
level
a
gross
receipts
tax
or
a
privilege
tax
on
all
the
income
from
armco
wherever
received.
they're
trying
to
levy
a
tax
on
transactions
which
they
claim,
and
you
deny,
have
some
nexus
with
west
virginia.
unknown
speaker
just
sales
to
west
virginia
customers,
right?
unknown
speaker
yet
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
there
need
be,
in
this
case,
no
nexus,
because
it
only
allowed
the
taxation
of
transactions...
of
sales
to
people
in
west
virginia.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
that
perhaps
analysis
under
apportioned
income
tax
may
be
somewhat
different
than
analysis
under
a
privilege
tax
such
as
this,
or
do
you
think
they're
the
same?
unknown
speaker
if
armco
had
organized
a
west
virginia
corporation
that
owned
and
operated
the
mine,
would
there
be
any
basis
for
any
analysis
of
the
unitary
system
or
imposing
any
tax
on
the
parent
corporation?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
west
virginia
would
assert
the
same
position
it
asserts
here?
unknown
speaker
would
you...
let
me
pursue
that
a
little
further?
you
think
there's
no
difference
in
the
two
situations?
unknown
speaker
of
what
west
virginia's
trying
to
do
here.
unknown
speaker
and
here
you'll
comment
on
the
pressed
steel
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
closest
case
in
your
favor,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
there
there
was
presence
for
other
purposes
but
not
presence
for
these
particular...
for
the
particular
sales
involved.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
theory
of
norton
was?
wasn't
it...
it
reads
to
me
as
though
it
were
a
commerce
theory
rather
than
a
due
process
theory.
unknown
speaker
or
a
nexus
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
were
a
commerce
clause
case,
you're
kind
of
in
trouble,
aren't
you?
you
would
rather
read
it
as
a
due
process
case.
unknown
speaker
are
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dailey,
what
economic
difference
do
you
think
there
really
is
between
a
local
sales
tax
borne
by
local
buyers
and
a
business
income
tax
calculated
on
the
basis
of
sales
made
to
buyers
in
the
taxing
state,
which
is
the
distinction
norton
tried
to
draw.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
an
economic
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
think
the...
norton
talked
about
either
a
sales
tax
or
a
business
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
know
that
he
is,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
matter
of
pure
economics,
how
could
it
be
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
most
courts
have
just
recognized
the
ability
to
pass
it
on
as
a
matter
of
something
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of.
unknown
speaker
on
their
wholesale
sales.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
armco
isn't
affected
by
that.
armco's
just
importing
from
out
of
state
and
doesn't
manufacture--
unknown
speaker
--the
particular
products
at
issue.
unknown
speaker
and
they
pay
a
higher
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
the
people
who
manufacture
within
west
virginia
and
sell
their
products
are,
in
effect,
paying
a
higher
tax
than
armco
who
is
importing
from
out
of
state.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
but
they're
paying
more
money;
therefore,
they
presumably
have
to
charge
their
customers
more.
so
armco
has
an
advantage
there,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
as
far
as
the
excise
tax
burden
that
we
know
about
from
the
briefs,
it
would
appear
that
manufacturers
within
west
virginia
selling
their
products
there
pay
a
higher
tax
than
armco.
unknown
speaker
right.
nor
any
real
estate
tax.
unknown
speaker
were
there
differences
for
the
local
taxpayers
in
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
were
there
differences,
different
tax
rates
for
the
domestic
corporations
in
those
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
your
argument,
though,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
not
just
the
sales,
not
just
the
delivery
of
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
about
a
gross
receipts
tax
at
all
if
there
were
no
solicitation
within
the
state
of
west
virginia?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
constitutionally
you'd
be
forbidden
to?
unknown
speaker
under
norton,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
to
hold
for
west
virginia
we
must
acknowledge,
as
you
would
put
it,
that
norton
is
overruled.
unknown
speaker
no?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
it's
just
not
good
law
any
more,
norton.
unknown
speaker
but
norton...
i
take
it
that
norton
would
not
come
out
the
same
way
today
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
say
that
if
you
applied
norton
exactly
the
way
it's
written
that
you
would
lose?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
these
people
were
residents
of
west
virginia?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
they're
franchised
dealers
in
one...
at
least
one
of
these
products
could
put
up...
could
put
up
their
name.
unknown
speaker
and
those
local
franchised
dealers
who
weren't
agents,
but
nevertheless,
they
certainly
solicited
the
sales
of
armco
products,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
supposed
to
engage
in
some
independent
factfinding
here
based
on
testimony
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
should...
we
should
not
accept
what...
what
one
of
your
courts
said
the
record
showed?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
just
the
sale
to
people
in
west
virginia
be
enough
of
a
nexus?
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
feel
there
has
to
be
more
than
the
sale
in
west
virginia,
to
a
west
virginia
customer,
that
is?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
based
on...
and
you
think
that
the
minimal
activity
cannot
be
the
sale
in
west
virginia.
is
that
because
of
norton?
unknown
speaker
you're
basing
that
on
norton
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
don't
have
much
confidence
in
norton.
you
seen
to
evade
it
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
any
way
defending
your
highest
court's
application
of
the
unitary
business
principle?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
need
to
rely
on
the
unitary
concept
to
get
the
result
you
want
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
why
should
we
muddy
up
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
simple
concept
by
trying
to
import
a
concept
developed
by
the
courts
for
an
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever
done
it
in
a
non-income
tax
case
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
there
were
no
physical
solicitation
activities
in
west
virginia
but
there
were
newspaper
ads,
television
ads,
and
they
just
answered...
they
just
answered
the
mail
and
the
telephone
calls
and
filled
those
orders
and
shipped
in
the
goods?
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough
under
your
theory?
the
solicitation
is
certainly
within
west
virginia.
the
west
virginians
read
it
in
the
paper,
saw
it
on
television
in
west
virginia.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think...
you
don't
think
the
legality
of
a
compensating
use
tax
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
not...
not
this...
not
this
part
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
because
you
do
collect
out
of
the
wholesale
transaction
the
compensating
use
tax,
an
amount
of
money
from
a
sale
that
would
involve
only
delivery
and
no
solicitation,
only
delivery
in
west
virginia.
unknown
speaker
you're
very
welcome,
very
welcome.
mr.
digges,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
you
had
the
facts
such
as
justice
white
described
with
nobody
actually
in
the
state
but
advertising
across
the
borders
and
so
forth,
just
as
a
matter
of
interpreting
your
own
statute,
it
wouldn't
apply,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
would
be
whether
there'd
be
a
constitutional
difference
in
the
event
your
statute
did
cover
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
digges,
if
other
states
had
a
similar
tax
scheme,
i
assume
what
would
happen
is
that
a
manufacturer,
a
local
manufacturer
selling
in
west
virginia
would
pay
only
the
manufacturing
tax,
is
that
right?
but
if
he
wanted
to
sell
out
of
state,
he...
he'd
be
subject
to
the
manufacturing
tax
and
a
sales
tax.
unknown
speaker
right.
assuming
other
states
had
a
similar
tax.
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
west
virginia,
if
that's
true,
really
be
taxing
exports,
and
would
that
violate
the
commerce
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there's
a
difference.
now,
a
manufacturer
who
wants
to
ship
goods
across
state
lines
would
end
up
paying
two
taxes
presumably,
and
the
one
who
just
manufactured
locally
would
pay
one.
so
under
that
scheme
would
west
virginia
be
taxing
the
exports?
unknown
speaker
discriminating?
unknown
speaker
mr.
digges,
let
me
follow
through
on
that
general
area.
viewed
in
isolation,
the
west
virginia
tax
is
discriminatory,
isn't
it,
because
the...
the
local
manufacturer
is
exempt
from
the
tax
that
armco
has
to
pay?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
exist.
unknown
speaker
it
does
exist,
doesn't
it?
one
local
manufacturer
doesn't
pay
a
tax
that
armco
does.
now,
that's
a
difference
in--
unknown
speaker
--how
do
you
justify
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
your...
your
manufacturer's
tax
were
1
percent
instead
of,
what
is
it,
88
percent?
unknown
speaker
would
the
case
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
we
to
decide
cases
up
here
according
to
the
rate
that
west
virginia
imposes?
unknown
speaker
i
think
this
gets
you
into
the
situation
that
justice
o'connor
proposed,
that
when
you
take
the
other
states'
taxes
into
consideration,
you're
almost
bound
to
end
up
with
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose...
suppose
the
practical
effect
weren't
the
same?
and
wouldn't...
doesn't
the
practical
effect
depend
on
rates,
comparative
rates?
and
again
i
get
back
to
suppose
your
tax
were
1
percent
instead
of
88
percent?
unknown
speaker
then
where...
where
is
the
dividing
line
between
1
percent
and
88
percent?
forty
percent?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
the
problem
come
from
the
interaction
of
the
manufacturing
tax
and
the...
the
tax
on
the
sale
price?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
difficulty.
west
virginia
could
eliminate
the
problem
by
reducing
its
manufacturing
tax
on
those
who
sell
out
of
state
or
by
eliminating
the
tax
on
the
sale
in-state,
but
it
wants
both.
and
so
that
leaves
you
with
some
kind
of
an
interaction
sort
of
a
problem,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we're
certainly
going
to
have
to
address
the
issue,
and
to
arrive
at
your
result,
it
seems
to
me
like
you
have
to
do
away
with
the
discrimination
in
some
manner.
and
you
say
well,
it's
because
the
local
manufacturer
pays
a
manufacturing
tax.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you.
are
you
saying
it's
totally
irrelevant
whether
there's
a
manufacturing
tax
imposed
in
ohio,
for
example?
assume
that's
where
its
plants
are.
unknown
speaker
so
the
constitutionality
of
the
west
virginia
tax
depends
on
what
ohio
does?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
i
mean
assuming
he
proved
all
the
relevant
facts,
then
the
critical
fact
then
would
be
what
the
ohio
legislature
decided
to
do
with
respect
to
the
manufacturing
tax--
