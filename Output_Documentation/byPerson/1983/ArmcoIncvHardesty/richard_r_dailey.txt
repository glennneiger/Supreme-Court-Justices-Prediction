mr.
richard
r.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia.
it
brings
into
question
the
validity
under
the
constitution
of
a
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
upon
the
appellant
armco
as
a
result
of
armco's
sale
of
property
to
customers
in
west
virginia.
the
issues
presented
are
two.
the
first
is
whether
these
was
a
sufficient
nexus
between
the
transactions
involved
here
and
the
state
of
west
virginia;
and
the
second
is
whether
the
tax
involved
here
is
invalid
because
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
armco
is
an
ohio
corporation
which
for
many
years
has
been
qualified
to
do
business
in
west
virginia.
during
the
period
1970
through
1975,
the
audit
periods
involved
here,
its
connection
with
the
state
of
west
virginia
was
of
three
sorts.
first,
it
operated
a
substantial
coal
mining
venture
in
west
virginia.
second,
it
operated
a
small
office
in
south
charleston
from
which
it
sold
construction
and
drainage
products.
and
third,
it
sold
to
customers
in
west
virginia
products
manufactured
outside
of
west
virginia.
the
tax
liabilities
owed
by
armco
to
west
virginia
from
the
operation
of
its
coal
mines
and
from
the
operation
of
its
charleston
office
are
not
at
issue
here.
what
is
at
issue
here
are
sales
of
three
products
manufactured
by
armco
outside
the
state.
those
products
are
metal
buildings,
steel
and
wire
rope.
these
sales
have
many
characteristics
in
common.
not
only
were
the
materials
manufactured
outside
of
west
virginia,
there
was
no
sales
office
involved
in
west
virginia,
no
resident
salesman
in
west
virginia,
no
inventory
in
west
virginia;
orders
were
accepted
outside
west
virginia,
and
the
goods
were
delivered
to
common
carriers
outside
west
virginia.
the
products
themselves
were
marked
in
west
virginia
in
two
different
ways.
the
metal
buildings
were
sold
to
two
franchised
dealers
within
west
virginia.
there
was
no
solicitation
of
these
sales
in
west
virginia,
simply
franchise
agreements
pursuant
to
which
armco
agreed
that
the
dealers
could
use
the
armco
name,
and
armco
agreed
to
share
advertising
expenses.
the
steel
and
wire
rope
products
were
solicited,
sales
were
solicited
within
west
virginia.
in
connection
with
the
steel
products,
four
nonresident
salesmen
visited
west
virginia
on
an
average
of
once
every
four
to
six
weeks.
and
with
regard
to
the
wire
rope,
three
nonresident
salesmen
visited
west
virginia
every
two
to
four
weeks.
the
tax
involved
here
is
an
annual
privilege
tax.
it
is
imposed
upon
the
gross
receipts
of
those
who
are
engaged
or
continuing
within
west
virginia
in
the
selling
of
tangible
property
at
wholesale.
the
lower
court
in
west
virginia
held
that
the
transactions
involved
here
did
not
have
a
sufficient
nexus
to
permit
taxation
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia
reversed.
my
remarks
today
will
address
three
points.
the
first
point
is
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
that
the
unitary
business
theory
should
be
applied
to
find
the
appropriate
nexus
here.
the
second
point
is
the
assertion
that
even
if
the
unitary
business
theory
is
not
applicable
here,
there
was
a
sufficient
nexus
between
these
transactions
and
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
and
the
third
is
armco's
claim
that
this
tax
is
unconstitutional
because
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
that's
correct.
if
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
gross
receipts
from
sales
of
wire
rope,
steel
and
metal
buildings
only
to
customers
in
west
virginia.
this
court
has
stated
that
a
state
tax
on
income
must
be
applied
through
an
activity
with
a
substantial
nexus
with
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
the
court
below
concluded,
on
the
other
hand,
that
it
did
not
need
to
examine
the
connection
between
these
transactions
and
the
state
of
west
virginia.
it
reached
that
result
because
it
applied
a
unitary
business
theory.
it
said
that
armco
was
a
unitary
business
operating
under
a
single
corporate
umbrella,
and
that
since
its
activities
in
the
area
of
coal
mining
were
substantial
in
west
virginia,
that
justified
them
in
taxing
the
gross
receipts
from
these
sales
without
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
was
any
nexus
between
the
sales
and
the
state
of
west
virginia.
this
is
a
rather
dramatic
departure
from
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and,
we
submit,
is
wholly
inappropriate.
the
unitary
business
theory
arose
in
response
to
a
peculiar
problem
posed
by
net
income
taxes.
the
problem
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
figure
out
how
much
of
a
corporation's
net
income
might
properly
be
said
to
be
attributable
to
any
given
taxing
jurisdiction.
accordingly,
under
the
theory,
with
which
this
court
has
some
familiarity,
the
total
net
income
of
a
taxpayer
unitary
business
is
peculiar,
and
then
that
income
is
apportioned
among
the
various
taxing
states
on
the
basis
of
formulas.
the
problem
of
not
being
able
to
compute
the
proper
amount
of
income
attributable
to
any
state
and
thus
the
occasion
for
the
unitary
business
theory
simply
is
not
present
in
the
case
of
a
gross
receipts
tax.
we
know
to
a
penny
armco's
gross
receipts
from
west
virginia
sales,
and
there
is
simply
no
occasion
for
the
theory.
more
important,
the
application
here
of
the
unitary
business
theory
would
evidently
remove
all
constitutional
restraints
on
the
ability
of
west
virginia
to
tax
armco
sales.
suppose,
for
example,
that
west
virginia
asserted
the
right
to
tax
property
manufactured
by
armco
in
ohio
and
sold
to
customers
in
indiana?
now,
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
west
virginia
can't
do
that.
and
i
suspect
the
reason
why
we
think
west
virginia
can't
do
that
is
that
such
a
transaction
has
absolutely
no
connection
to
the
state
of
west
virginia.
but
that
the
connection
with
the
state
of
west
virginia
is
precisely
what
the
court
below
said
it
didn't
have
to
look
at.
so
on
the
whole,
we
suggest
that
the
traditional
nexus
rules
which
require
a
substantial
nexus
to
the
activity
being
taxed
has
served
us
well.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
of
course,
there
is
also
a
state
law
problem.
you
must
be
found,
under
the
state
statute,
to
be
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
at
wholesale
in
west
virginia.
so
that
my
example
of
the
sale
from
ohio
to
indiana
is
a
purely
constitutional
example,
not...
not...
we
would
still
have
to
find
the
business
in
west
virginia
as
a
batter
of
state
law.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
oh,
i
think
the
analysis
of
the
income
arising
in
a
jurisdiction
is...
is
the
amount
of
income
that's
being
taxed
is
quite
different
in
a
gross
receipts
tax
case
and
a
net
income
tax
case.
as
i
say,
in
a
net
income
tax
case,
it
is
an
accounting
impossibility
to
allocate
properly
the
net
incomes
of
the
various
taxing
jurisdictions,
and
thus
the
birth
of
the
unitary
business
theory.
no
such
problem
is
presented
in
the
case
of
gross
receipts.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
i
think
the
question
with
regard
to
the
sales
that
are
at
issue
here,
your
honor,
would
be
precisely
the
same.
if
a
transaction--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--i
think
so.
if
the
transaction...
if
the
transactions
have
a
substantial--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--oh,
i
suspect
they
would.
logically
they
would.
assuming
for
a
moment
that
the--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--not
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
we're
presenting.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
application
of
the
unitary
business
theory
is
improper,
we
turn
to
the
question
of
what
else
might
constitute
a
sufficient
nexus
here.
one
potential
source
is
the
very
infrequent
solicitation
of
orders
by
nonresident
salesmen
who
come
into
west
virginia.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes,
i
will
comment
on
the
pressed
steel
case.
standard
pressed
steel
involved
a
washington
tax
on
gross
receipts
from
sales
to
a
single
customer
in
washington.
those
sales
were
solicited
by
a
resident
of
washington
who
operated
full-time
in
washington
as
an
employee
of
the
seller
to
solicit
orders
from
boeing,
a
single
customer.
the
standard
pressed
steel
case
involved
a
continuous
presence
in
the
state
of
washington,
a
presence
which
the
court
found
contributed
directly
to
the
sales
in
question.
we
think
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
general
motors
case;
that
there
was
a
continuous
and
important
presence
within
the
state
that
contributed
to
the
production
of
the
sales
in
question.
here
there
is
no
continuous
presence
at
all
in
the
state.
armco's
connection
with
the
state
of
west
virginia
so
far
as
these
sales
go
is
really
flimsy.
there's
not
a
great
deal
to
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
two
cases
support
our
view
and
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
earlier
decision
of
this
court
in
the
norton
case--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
precisely.
and
this
court
held
that
you
could
not,
in
effect,
borrow
the
nexus
from
the
activities
that
were
clearly
being
carried
on
within
the
state
and
attribute
that
nexus
to
the
sales
in
question.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
it's
difficult--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--it...
well,
it
clearly
is
a
nexus
theory.
as
to
whether
it
should
be
thought
of
as
a
due
process
case
or
a
commerce
clause
case,
it
is
difficult
to
tell.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
we
are
content
with
reading
it
either
way.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes.
yes,
we
think
it
supports
us
no
matter
which
provision
we're
under.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
think
there's
an--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--economic
difference.
in
order
to
conclude
that,
let
us
say,
a
use
tax
imposed
on
a
local
purchaser
is...
is
comparable
to
a
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
on
the
seller,
you
have
to
make
a
couple
of
assumptions.
one
is
that
it
was
sort
of...
it's
a
matter
of
indifference
to
a
state
legislature
whether
they
enact
a
use
tax
on
the
local
buyer
or
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
foreign
seller.
i
don't
believe
that
assumption
is
warranted.
i
think
that
legislatures
find
a
use
tax
to
be
a
very
politically
responsive
tax
imposed
on
local
residents.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
yes.
and
in
order...
it
did,
you're
correct.
and
in
order
to
find
those
comparable,
you
must
also
assume
that
in
the
case
of
a
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
on
a
seller,
to
make
them
comparable
you
must
assume
that
the
seller
is
able
to
pass
on
the
burden
of
that
tax.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
i
don't
know
that
we
do
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
well,
it
could
be
otherwise
if
the
market...
the
sales
price
is
a
price
negotiated
in
some
sort
of
bargaining,
and
the
extent
to
which
a
seller
is
able
to
pass
on
a
gross
receipts
tax
and
place
the
burden
of
it
on
his
buyer
seems
to
me
to
be
a
factor
of
a
variety
of
economic
considerations.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
well,
here
i
think
it's
particularly
important
that
we
not
assume
that
the
tax
can
be
passed
on
to
the
purchasers,
because
the
basis
of
the
discrimination
argument,
which
is
my
final
point,
is
that
local
manufacturers
in
west
virginia
are
exempt
from
this
tax,
which
may
make
it
a
little
bit--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--yes,
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
that
is
correct.
armco
does
not
manufacture.
but
armco
is
selling
in
competition
with
those
who
do
manufacture.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
well,
it's
paying
a
higher
tax
on
a
different
activity.
it
is
exempt--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because...
i'm
willing
to
assume
that
manufacturers
in
west
virginia
pay
a
variety
of
taxes,
not
only
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
from
manufacturing
but
property
taxes
and
no
doubt
a
variety
of
taxes
to
which
armco
is
not
subject
at
all
because
it
manufactures--
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
--that
is
correct.
armco
does
no
pay
any
manufacturing
tax
in
west
virginia.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
no.
nor
any
sales
tax.
that's
correct.
it
does,
i
might
say
as
an
aside,
pay
a
considerable
amount
of
tax
in
ohio,
but
in
west
virginia,
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
return
for
a
moment
to
armco's
claim
that
the
west
virginia
tax
on
wholesale
sales
is
unconstitutional
because
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
the
starting
point
here
is
the
statute
itself
which
imposes
the
wholesale
tax
on
manufacturers
operating
outside
west
virginia,
but
exempts
local
manufacturers
from
paying
the
tax.
so
far,
the
discrimination
seems
clear.
now,
the
saving
grace
is
said
to
be
the
local
tax
on
manufacturing
which
is
imposed
on
manufacturers
in
west
virginia,
but
obviously
not
imposed
on
those
outside
west
virginia.
these
are,
however,
entirely
different
taxes
imposed
at
different
rates,
and
most
importantly,
imposed
upon
different
activities.
the
manufacturing
tax
does
not
compensate
for
the
tax
on
wholesale
sales
in
the
same
manner,
for
example,
that
a
use
tax
compensates
for
a
sales
tax.
and
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
clear
that
only
in
the
case
of
taxes
which
complement
or
compensate
for
each
other
are
we
to
consider
them
together
in
judging
discrimination.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
r.
dailey
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
nexus
issue
i
think
comes
down
to
here
is
this:
we
have
only
the
most
tenuous
connection
between
the
transactions
being
taxed
and
the
state
of
west
virginia.
a
handful
of
salesmen
without
authority
to
enter
into
any
contractual
relationships
visiting
west
virginia
on
a
very
infrequent
basis,
to
tax
these
sales
comes
perilously
close,
i
suggest,
to
the
imposition
of
a
state
import
duty.
west
virginia
is
attempting
to
charge
for
access
to
its
market
and
so
is
trying
to
tax
values
realized
outside
the
state.
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
trade
barrier
that
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
armco
submits
that
the
traditional
nexus
rules
have
served
us
well
and
should
be
retained.
we
should
require
a
continuous
local
presence
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction
to
support
the
imposition
of
an
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
on
sales.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
