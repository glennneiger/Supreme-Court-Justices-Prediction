unknown
speaker
now
abney
came
up
in
a
somewhat
different
posture
than
this
case,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
why
do
you
have
to
assume
the
validity
of
your
claim
in
order
to
determine
its
appealability?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
presumably
you'll
never
know
whether
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
violation
until
you
get
a
determination
on
the
merits
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
there's
a
circularity
about
it,
i
suppose,
from
both
sides.
unknown
speaker
but
that
assumes
a
view
of
the
law
of
double
jeopardy
that
is
certainly
not
necessarily
represented
by
any
of
this
court's
opinions.
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
so
long
as
it's
a
hung
jury
the
jeopardy
simply
has
not
ceased
to
attach.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
a
mr.
palmer,
do
you
mean
one
that
will...
ultimately
ought
to
be
validated
or
one
that
you
just
cite
the
right
cases
for?
unknown
speaker
but
now
that's
a
view
of
double
jeopardy
law,
but
it
certainly
is
not
nailed
down
by
any
cases
of
this
court.
you
may
be
right
or
wrong
on
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
courts
of
appeals
may
agree
on
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
certainly
resolved
the
thing
one
way
or
the
other.
do
you
mean,
mr.
palmer,
that
in
every
case
where
a
jury
cannot
agree
the
defendant
is
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
that's
almost
what
i
gathered
from
what
you
just
said.
that
would
be,
i
think,
the
british
approach,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
doesn't
that
add
up
to
just
what
i
described
as
your
position
that
in
every
case
where
a
jury
does
not
agree
unanimously--
unknown
speaker
--what
other
grounds
do
you
suggest
that
produce
a
hung
jury?
unknown
speaker
just
in
the
abstract,
when
a
jury
does
not
agree
either
on
some
counts
or
on
all
counts?
unknown
speaker
then
you
say
that's
the
end
of
the
road
for
the
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
i
thought
i
heard
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--you're
limiting
your
argument
to
situations
in
which
the
trial
judge
has
made
an
error
in
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
because
there
was
insufficient
proof
by
the
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
to
get
the
prosecution
to
the
jury;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
in
that
situation
where
he
makes
the
error
and
there's
a
hung
jury
that
you
say
you
make
your
argument
for
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
palmer,
have
you
ever
seen
a
criminal
case
where
the
defense
attorney
didn't
make
a
motion
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case
to
dismiss
for
insufficient
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
haven't,
and
i
have
sat
on
many,
and
what
you're
really
talking
about
here
is
setting
up
the
possibility,
at
least,
of
making
federal
habeas
claims
in
every
state
prosecution
that
might
end
in
a
hung
jury
based
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
claimed.
it
isn't
that
you're
going
to
win
all
of
those,
but
it
certainly
would
afford
opportunities
for
extended
delay
and
difficulty
as
a
result
of
it
if
you're
correct.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
you're
right,
the
point
is
i
guess
we
have
to
be
a
little
bit
concerned
with
the
administration
of
the
system
and
with
seeing
to
it
that
maybe
state
prosecutions
can
go
on
and
finish
their
course
before
we
start
the
federal
habeas
review.
so
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
double
jeopardy
just
never
matures
as
long
as
the
jury
hasn't
come
in
with
a
verdict
in
the
first
trial.
maybe
it
just
never
matures
to
the
point
that
you
can
make
your
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
suppose
what
we
decide
here
will
certainly
be
governing
what
happens
on
federal
habeas
from
state
prosecutions.
under
your
most
recent
answer,
mr.
palmer,
can
the
state
statutes
limit
the
right
of
federal
habeas
corpus
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
in
every
case,
in
every
case
in
a
state
court,
even
though
here
we
have
a
federal
case,
in
every
case
where
there
is
a
hung
jury
in
a
state
case
automatically
that
would
be
a
habeas
corpus
case,
and
the
habeas
federal
district
court
would
be
performing
the
function
of
the
state
appellate
process
to
determine
the
issues
you
raised.
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
under
the
habeas
statute
doesn't
the
habeas
petitioner
have
to
exhaust
all
of
his--
unknown
speaker
--state
remedies
before
he's
allowed
into
habeas?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
get
the
right
to
appeal
on
a
hung
jury?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
basis
of
the
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
normal
appeal?
wouldn't
that
be
done
in
a
normal
appeal
if
he
had
been
convicted?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
be
the
appeal
you
would
have
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
you
make
that...
what
judgment
did
you
appeal
from?
unknown
speaker
what
judgment,
judgment?
you
know
what
a
judgment
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
your
double
jeopardy
claim
at
the
stage
of
where
the
jury
came
in
on?
what
was
the
status
at
that
stage
that
would
grant
you
the
right
to
appeal?
unknown
speaker
what
else
was
done
in
deciding
this
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
appeal
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
how
can
you
appeal
it
indirectly?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
now
admitting
you
did
appeal.
unknown
speaker
can
you
put
that
in
without
a
judgment?
can
you
raise
that
on
appeal
without
a
judgment
of
conviction?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
my
point
is
you
cannot
raise
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
you
happen
to
raise
it
now?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
the
evidence
did
not
convict
him?
unknown
speaker
you
said
"convict
him
again".
i
thought
you
said
he
was
not
convicted
any
time,
not
even
a
half
a
time.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
but
he
does
have
a
right
to
appeal?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true,
mr.
palmer,
as
i
think
justice
rehnquist
may
have
made
the
point
earlier,
that
all
of
the
double
jeopardy
cases,
from
this
court,
at
least...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
have
not
allowed
a
double
jeopardy
claim
as
a
bar
to
a
second
trial
unless
there
has
been
a
judgment
terminating
the
first
trial.
and
you're
really
relying
on
a
hypothetical
judgment
that's
never
been
entered,
namely
you're
contending
that
the
judge
should
have
granted
your
motion
for...
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
of
insufficient
evidence.
but
he
denied
that
motion,
so
there
really
is...
you're
in
effect
relying
on
a
judgment
you
don't
have
yet.
unknown
speaker
correct,
and
there
is
no
case,
is
there,
in
which
a
double
jeopardy,
a
successful
double
jeopardy,
plea
has
been
sustained
on
the
basis
of
a
right
to
obtain
a
judgment
that
you
didn't
get?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
familiar
with
sneed.
tell
me,
is
that
a
case--
unknown
speaker
--oh.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
maybe
their
analysis
is
unsound
there.
unknown
speaker
this
was
after
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
am
puzzled.
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
is
not
unknown
at
the
conclusion
of
a
trial
in
which
there
has
been
a
hung
jury
so
that
there
is
no
verdict,
trial
judges
have
been
known
to
make
an
analysis
and
decide
that
the
case...
the
judge
should
not
have
submitted
the
case
to
the
jury,
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence,
and
he
can
then
correct
the
error
that
you
seek
to
correct
here;
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
and
now
suppose
the
judge,
who
has
heard
all
the
evidence,
thinks
it's
an
overwhelming
case,
but
for
reasons
which
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
explain
about
how
juries
function,
including
their
right
of
compassionate
verdict,
they
have
decided
to
reach
no
verdict.
now
why
is
not
the
trial
judge,
who
knows
more
about
the
evidence
than
any
appellate
court
could
possibly
know
and
the
credibility
of
witnesses,
why
is
that
not
the
route
for
the
relief
that
you're
seeking?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
that
time,
after
the
hung
jury.
nothing
to
prevent
you--
unknown
speaker
--beg
your
pardon?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know,
but
there's
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
granting
that
relief.
suppose
he
knows,
whether
he
should
know
it
or
not,
that
the
jury
was
eleven-to-one
for
a
conviction,
and
sometimes
those
things
become
known
around
a
courthouse.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless
you
would
say
that
there's
an
absolute
right
to
a
review
of
the
kind
you
are
seeking
now?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
judge
was
in
a
position
to
make
that
appraisal,
was
he
not,
whether
he
had
adequate
help
from
the
prosecution
or
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
suppose...
let
me
ask
you
this.
what
if
we
decided
that
there
really
is
no
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim
in
a
situation
like
this,
that
jeopardy
is
never
ended,
that
the
defendant
can
be
retried,
and
that
the
issue
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial
is
never
over,
even
after
he's
convicted
at
a
second
trial,
which
is
different
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
below,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
let's
just
suppose
that--
unknown
speaker
--five
justices
thought
that.
what
should
we
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
are
in
great
difficulty,
but
what
should
we
do
with
it?
what
should
we
do
with
it
if
the
double
jeopardy
issue
on
its
merits
isn't
appealable?
how
can
we
ever
reach
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
were
appealable,
it
would
only
be
appealable
once,
if
there
were
five
justices
who
thought
that
it
was
not
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
issue
because
it
would
never
do
you
any
good
to
appeal
on
this
ground,
on
the
double
jeopardy
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
may
call
that
an
anomaly,
but
that's
the
way
the
railroad's
been
run
for
a
long
time,
and
the
only
possible
ground
that
you've
got
is
that
burks
came
along.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
always
follow
this
remousely
the
logic
of
some
prior
case.
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
government
reprosecute
this
man?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
they
alleged
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
you
did,
you
filed
a
motion
for
acquittal
and
a
motion
in
bar
of
double
jeopardy,
and
they
were
both
considered
together,
and
both
denied
together,
and
now
you're
trying
to
bootstrap
one
on
top
of
the
other.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
depending
on
that.
i'm
depending
on
the
record
that
you
filed,
which
says
just
what
i
said.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
go
back
on
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
give
me
one
case
where
that
was
done?
unknown
speaker
where
there
was
a
motion
for
acquittal
and
a
motion
to
bar
trial
of
the
man
considered
at
the
same
time?
give
me
the
case.
unknown
speaker
that
man
was
convicted,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
he?
this
man
wasn't
convicted.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
answer
to
my
question
you
don't
have
any
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
give
me
the
case.
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
was
the
man
convicted?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
little
different
from
this
one?
unknown
speaker
not
really?
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
jury
in
this
instance
didn't
reach
a
verdict.
unknown
speaker
so
perhaps
the
first
trial
was
never
actually
completed
in
that
sense,
and
maybe
jeopardy
doesn't
attach
in
those
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
or
it
attaches
but
doesn't
mature.
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
it
hinges
on
what
the
judge
did,
not
what
the
jury
did.
unknown
speaker
it
hinges
on
what
the
judge
did,
not
what
the
jury
did.
the
judge
didn't
enter
the
order
granting
your
motion
for
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
so,
but
as
justice
o'conner
points
out
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
cases
that
will
be
appealed
if
you
prevail.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
there
won't
be.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
in
very
few
of
those
cases
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell.
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
if
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial
can
be
raised
at
the
second
trial,
as
the
majority
below
found,
how
is
that
affected
by
the
merits
of
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand
your
position
on
why
it
isn't
collateral.
unknown
speaker
but
i
just
don't
see
how
an
order
denying
a
claim
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial
can
be
anything
but
collateral
to
everything
that
goes
on
at
an
entirely
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
a
trial
that's
already
taken
place,
isn't
there
something
to
what
justice
o'conner
says,
that
anything
that
happened
at
the
first
trial
is
almost
by
definition
collateral
to
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
what
the
court
of
appeals
majority
found,
judge
wilke's
opinion--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
thought
that
was
fine
all
the
way
until
footnote
25
of
your
brief
up
here,
and
seem
to
have
changed
your
position--
unknown
speaker
--but
your
second
position
i
thought
that
you
were
going
to
voice
today
was
that
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
issue
at
all
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
needn't
be,
need
they?
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
that's
true
whatever
you
might
think
about
the
state
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
that
issue
ever
be
open,
if
i
believe
you,
after
he
is
tried
and
convicted
at
a
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
consequently,
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
that
you...
that
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
majority
in
this
respect.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
let
me
challenge
you
on
that.
supposing
it's
reviewable
at
the
end
of
the
second
trial
and
at
that
time
a
court
holds
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
granted,
and
then
they
enter
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
would
not
that
judgment
bar
the
second
conviction?
wouldn't
that
at
least
raise
a
double
jeopardy
question?
unknown
speaker
and
as
of
the
end
of
the
first
trial--
unknown
speaker
--there
would
be
a
judicial
determination
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
have
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
end
of
the
first
trial.
now
wouldn't
that
bar
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
he's
already
been
retried.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you--
--but
his
conviction
is
then
set
aside.
he
set
aside
his
conviction.
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
issue
if
that
happened.
unknown
speaker
they
would
set
aside
his
conviction,
wouldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
set
aside
his
conviction,
then?
unknown
speaker
after
the
first
trial.
but
you
have
tried
him
a
second
time.
you
have
gotten
a
conviction.
you
have
just
postponed
the
review
of
the
first
trial,
and
at
that
time
you've
got
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
books,
and
he's
asking
to
have
it
set
aside
because
the
first
trial
should
have
ended
in
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
if
this
case
is
tried
a
second
time,
and
then
there's
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
what
record
does
the
court
of
appeals
review...
the
record
of
the
first
trial
or
the
record
of
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
get
the
record
before
the
second
trial?
how
would
you
get
the
record
of
the
first
trial
into
the
record
of
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
either
how
you
get
it
in
there.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
judge,
the
court
of
appeals
judge,
said
that
in
considering
the
second
case
they
ruled
that
the
first
case
was
wrong.
well,
how
did
that
first
one
get
before
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
in
a
sense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let
me
give
you
one,
that
double
jeopardy
doesn't
apply
to
civil
cases,
period.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
really
understood
your
response
to
my
earlier
question.
let
me
try
again.
when
there
has
been
a
trial
and
no
verdict
so
that
the
case
is
tried
again,
whether
it
is
because
one
of
the
jurors
died
while
they
were
in
deliberations
and
the
parties
wouldn't
stipulate
to
trying
it
on
the
eleven
jurors
or
whatever,
there
is
a
second
trial.
a
conviction
results.
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
review.
what
record
does
the
court
of
appeals
review...
the
first
trial
or
the
second
trial?
before
i
got
some
ambiguity
from
you,
but
i
sat
on
that
court
for
13
years,
many,
many,
many
cases,
with
reviewing
a
second
trial
where
there
was
a
mistrial
in
the
first
case.
never
did
i
see
any
record
of
the
first
trial.
unknown
speaker
we'll
resume
here
at
1:00.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
if
one
were
to
adopt
judge
scalia's
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
jeopardy
does
not
cease
to
attach
merely
by
a
hung
jury,
then
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
review
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial
following
the
second
trial
if
the
first
trial
resulted
in
a
hung
jury,
as
you
have
here.
unknown
speaker
and
does
the
government
agree
or
disagree
with
judge
scalia's
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
suppose
we
agree
with
judge
scalia
to
this
extent,
that
retrying
this
man
without
passing
on
the
evidence
is
not
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
and
that
the
issue
is
never
open.
suppose
we
decided,
give
the
facts
and
we
decide
that
first.
do
you
think
that
question
could
be
decided
first,
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
if
we
decided
that.
then
what
would
we
do
with
the
issue
about
appealability?
unknown
speaker
one
could
say
that...
it
just
becomes
a
frivolous
issue
then,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
on
the
merits,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
give
me
the
jurisdictional
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
claim
just
doesn't
sound
in
it,
so
it
isn't
a
final
judgment.
he
isn't
being
deprived
of
anything.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
he
says
in
his
notice
of
appeal
the
first
caption
is,
this
claim
sounds
in
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
extend
your
jurisdiction
to
frivolous
claims,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
it
looks
to
me
like
you'd
be
most
satisfied
with
a
ruling
that
there's
no
colorable
double
jeopardy
claim.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
you
had
that
ruling
why
would
not...
and
say
you
properly
characterize
your
opponent's
motion
as
one
for
judgment
of
acquittal
for
insufficient
evidence,
why
isn't
the
denial
of
such
a
motion
appealable
as
a
collateral
order?
what
element
of
the
three-pronged
test
is
missing?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
saying
i'm
not
going
to
rely
on
abney.
i'm
going
to
rely
on
cohen,
the
basic
collateral
order
doctrine.
why
doesn't...
why
isn't
a
properly
characterized
non-double
jeopardy
claim,
just
an
insufficiency
at
the
end
of
the
first
proceeding,
why
isn't
that
appealable,
because
you
never
can
really
get
effective
review
of
it
later?
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
asking
why
isn't
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
claim
that
i'm
raising
is
completely
independent
of
what
may
happen
at
the
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
not
completely
separate
from
guilt
or
innocence.
but
it's
completely
independent
of
the
merits
of
the
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
it
would
if
you
got
another
witness.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is.
but
at
least
hypothetically
it
could
be
entirely
different.
you
might
have
two
witnesses
that
you
couldn't
get
for
the
first
trial
and
you
had
them
for
the
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
i
don't
know
whether
any
of
the
hypotheticals
or
your
responses
covered
another
situation
i'd
like
to
put
to
you.
the
first
trial
includes
evidence
which
on
review
of
the
first
trial
the
appellate
court
decides
certain
evidence
was
inadmissible
and
that
he
is
ordered
retrial
without
that
evidence.
then
the
defendant
raises
in
that
same
posture
the
claim
that's
being
raised
here,
that
is,
that
the
evidence,
the
total
evidence,
without
the
evidence
found
inadmissible,
would
not
have
been
properly
submissible
to
the
jury
and,
therefore,
a
new
trial
will
be
double
jeopardy.
is
that
a
practical
problem
with
respect
to
state
cases
especially?
unknown
speaker
and
for
the
same
reason
after
such
rulings
you
can't
go
to
federal
habeas.
unknown
speaker
but
is
your
response
directed
at
those
category
of
state
cases
which
could
not
have
federal
habeas
available
in
relation
to
justice
white's...
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
because
if
the
states
could
come
in
we
would
have
in
the
aggregate
28
or
29,000
state
court
judges,
7,000
or
8,000
of
them
general
jurisdiction
judges,
as
against
about
300
federal
judges
who
would
be
involved
as
we
are
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcconnell,
the
procedure
in
this
case
was
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
for
acquittal.
when
was
that
motion
filed?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
interested...
i'm
interested
in
the
motion
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
it
was
filed
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
before
the
hung
jury?
unknown
speaker
timewise.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
were
those
two
combined
and
heard
together?
unknown
speaker
well,
had
there
been
any
motion
or
anything
to
retry?
unknown
speaker
before
that?
unknown
speaker
was
there?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
motion
to
retry
yet,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
motion
to
try?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
the
government
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
have
to
plead?
don't
you
have
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty?
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
you
just
fudge
them
both
together
down
there?
unknown
speaker
but
for
the
purpose
of
jurisdiction,
i
don't
see
how
the
judge
that's
trying
the
first
case
can
decide
what's
going
to
be
done
in
the
second
case.
unknown
speaker
will
the
same
judge
try
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
hadn't
been,
had
it?
unknown
speaker
had
it
been
reassigned?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
my
whole
point
is
how
can
one
case
move
over
into
the
other
one.
that's...
i
have
trouble
with
that.
unknown
speaker
after
the
disposal
of
these
motions
following
the
mistrial,
then
is
it
not
the
same
as
any
other
untried
indictment?
unknown
speaker
it
just
goes
back
on
the
calendar.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
an
untried
indictment.
