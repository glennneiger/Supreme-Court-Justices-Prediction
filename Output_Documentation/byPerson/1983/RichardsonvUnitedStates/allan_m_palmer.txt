mr.
allan
m.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
going
to
first
direct
our
attention
to
the
appealability
issue
and
for...
in
discussing
that
i
am
going
to
assume
for
the
moment,
but
only
the
moment,
that
we
have
raised
a
valid
double
jeopardy
claim.
now
the
government
disputes
the
appealability
of
this
claim
under
abney
on
the
theory
that
the
so-called
second
prong
of
the
cohen
test
is
not
met.
the
government
suggests
that
because
we
address
the
merits
of
the
claim
it's
not
collateral.
now
realistically
it
would
appear
to
us
that
we
have
both
been
circling
the
issue
and
it
was
only
recently
that...
in
the
flanagan
case
that
justice
o'conner
brought
us
back,
i
believe,
to
the
original
understanding
of
the
matter,
and
it
is
this:
in
the
flanagan
case
the
court
said
it
is
not
collateral
if
it's
not
independent
of
the
issues
to
be
tried.
its
validity
cannot
be
adequately
reviewed
until
the
trial
is
complete.
and
again
in
macdonald,
discussing
the
speedy
trial
claim,
the
court
said
"there
needs
to
be
a
divorce
between
the
claim
and
the
events
at
trial.
"
to
us
this
boils
down
to
the
following:
that
if
there
be
no
need
to
look
at
the
events
of
trial
to
determine
the
claim,
it
is
indeed
collateral.
and
in
this
case
the
trial,
of
course,
is
something
we
seek
to
avoid.
we
have
an
extant
record
of
the
first
trial,
which,
we
say,
shows
clear
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
that
is
why
the
chief
justice
in
abney
said
that
the
very
nature
of
a
double
jeopardy
claim
such
that
it
is
collateral
and
independent
to
the
principal
issues
to
be
tried,
and
we
think
in
that
light
there
is
no
question
but
all
three
prongs
of
the
cohen
test
have
been
met.
now--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--yes,
sir.
your
honor,
unquestionably,
but
the
posture
in
which
it
arose
does
not
change
the
operable
principles
as
to
the
cohen
factors.
we
still
have...
we're
assuming
now
a
double
jeopardy
violation.
if
it's
a
double
jeopardy
violation--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
because
if
it's
not
a
double
jeopardy
violation,
we're
out
of
court.
there's
no
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
as
we
indicated,
it's
a
self-determining
claim.
when
you
say
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
when
the
government
fails
at
a
criminal
trial
to
prove
enough
to
go
to
the
jury,
we
say
that
raises
a
collateral
bar,
that
it
has
no
right
to
a
second
bite
of
the
apple.
now
indeed
in
determining
that,
the
same
claim
of
insufficiency,
you
must
look
at
the
record,
the
evidence
adduced,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
violation
has
occurred,
but
that
is
separate.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
that
gets
us
to
the
next
question,
whether
it
is
double
jeopardy
or
not,
whether
there
is
jeopardy,
and
that's
why
i
assumed
for
the
first
argument
that
it
was,
because
the
government
now
makes
the
claim
that
it
isn't.
now...
but
i
think
if
it
is
double
jeopardy,
if
we
have
a
right
to
avoid
a
retrial
if
the
evidence
was
insufficient
at
the
first
trial,
then
i
think
abney
clearly
applies.
all
three
prongs
of
the
test
are
clearly
met.
now
i
think
the
question
that
your
honor
is
addressing
is
you
have
trouble
with
visualizing
or
conceptualizing
this
as
a
true
double
jeopardy
claim,
and
that
takes
us
to
the
next
question.
prior
in
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--a
true
double
jeopardy
claim
in
the
sense
that
it
raises
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
its
determination,
whether
we're
right
or
wrong,
will
vary
with
whether
or
not
you
consider
the
evidence
insufficient.
but
when
you
say
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial,
the
government
did
not
produce
enough
evidence
to
support
a
conviction.
we're
saying
that
it
has
no
right
at
the
second
bite
of
the
apple.
it
has
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
convict,
but
it
failed.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
think
burks
supplies
us
with
an
underpinning
to
make
that
argument.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
it
has
said
that,
in
a
mistrial
context,
that
it's
double
jeopardy.
they
go
up
on
the
question
well,
is
it
appealable
now
or
later,
but
they
all
agree
that
it
is
double
jeopardy
and
the
government
cannot
prosecute
again.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
have
tried
many
cases.
we
have
had
hung
juries.
but
rare
is
the
case
in
which
you
will
find
a
hung
jury
predicated
upon
or
bottomed
upon
insufficient
evidence.
we're
saying
under
the
glasser
test,
virginia
v.
jackson,
that
where
the
hung
jury
is
based...
is
bottomed
on
a
government's
prosecution
that
fails
to
muster
enough
evidence
to
get
to
the
jury
and
the
trial
court
errs
in
submitting
it,
we
think
in
that
context
the
government
should
have
no
right
to
reprosecute
because
it
has
failed
in
its
burden
of
proof.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
because
in
many
cases
they
may
have
trouble
with
a
witness.
nine
jurors
may
say
well,
i
don't
believe
him,
but
the
evidence
will
be
sufficient.
in
practically
every
case
tried
rare
is
the
case
in
which
a
counsel
in
good
faith
could
say
well,
the
evidence
here
was
insufficient.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
which
someone
could
not
be
retried?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
when
you
can't
get
twelve
jurors
to
say
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
oh,
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
really
enables
us
to
present
our
claim
of
double
jeopardy,
which
is
grounded
in
the
notion
that
in
this
particular--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes,
it
should
never
get
to
the
jury.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
solely
in
that
limited
context.
and
the
last
case
reversed--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--yes.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
it
may
be
in
the
habeas
corpus
context
that
if
the
government
has
failed
in
its
proof
it
has
no
right
to
retry
somebody.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
insofar
as
the
states
are
concerned,
we're
just
talking
here
about
a
federal
statute
and
the
appealability
thereunder.
the
states
probably
could
provide
a
rule
that
they
could
not
be
appealed
on
that
ground
until
after
the
second
trial
or
conviction
and,
therefore,
habeas
would
be
inappropriate.
that
could
be
an
alternative.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
oh,
i
don't
believe
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
don't
know
the
context
of
the
rise.
i
assume
your
honor
is
saying
if
there's
a
hung
jury
and
it's
insufficient
evidence
could
they
then
rush
into
federal
district
court.
i
would
assume
that
the
states
could
make
a
rule
if
they
wanted
to
provide
by
statute
you
could
raise
the
claim,
but
only
upon
appeal
from
the
conviction,
and
i
think
that
would...
in
that
sense--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--state
remedies.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
i
understand
that
to
be
the
rule.
of
course,
i'm
not
here
in
the
context
of
a
habeas
case,
am
not
entirely
familiar
with
the
full
panoply
of
habeas
corpus.
we're
here
in
the
context
of
appealability
in
the
federal...
in
this
system.
insofar
as
the
federal
system
is
concerned--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
we
filed
a
motion
in
bar
of
prosecution
based
on
double
jeopardy,
and
then
when
that
was
denied
we
appealed
that
denial.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
we
alleged
and
indeed
show
at
length
in
our
brief,
that
the
evidence
in
support
of
the
prosecution
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
glasser.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
if
he
had
been
convicted--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--of
course,
if
he
had
been
convicted.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
failure
to--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--yes,
sir.
the
judgment
was
failure
to
honor
our
double
jeopardy
claim.
that
is
what
we
appealed
from.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
when
they
were
hung
and
a
mistrial
declared.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
was
it.
the
judge
set
a
new
trial
date.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
you
cannot
directly
appeal
that,
as
such.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
because--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
we
appealed
it
because
everything...
you
may
view
evidence...
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
a
criminal
trial,
evidence
of
other
criminal
acts
cannot
come
in
to
show
the
defendant's
a
bad
actor,
but
you
can
put
in
the
very
same
evidence--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--as
such,
you
cannot
raise
it,
as
such.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
it
has
to
be
geared
to
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
correct.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i'll
show
you.
if
the
defendant
were
convicted
and
the
evidence
were
insufficient,
as
in
this
case,
we
allege,
the
conviction
must
be
overturned
and
a
direction
for
an
acquittal
because
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
now
it
is
our
theory
that
just
because
he
was
not
convicted
and
the
jury
came
a
step
closer
to
the
direct
result,
because
the
evidence
is
insufficient
they
were
erroneous
in
convicting
him.
merely
because
they
came
a
step
closer
to
the
correct
result
and
moved
toward
an
acquittal
should
not
preclude
him...
why
should
he
be
in
a
worse
position
because
the
jury
came
closer
to
the
correct
result
than
because
it
erred
entirely?
our
point
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
jury
does
this
evidence
is
insufficient
and
the
government,
under
the
burks
test,
has
no
right
to
retry
this
man,
to
reprosecute
him.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
correct,
and
we
don't
think
the
government
should
have
the
right
on
its
failure
of
proof
to
attempt
to
convict
him
again.
that
was
the
very
point
of
the
burks
case.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
should
not
have
the
right
to--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--a
hundred
percent
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
government
does
not--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--the
government
does
not
have
the
right
to
retry
and
reprosecute
a
man
if
it
failed
to
muster
evidence
at
the
first
trial
sufficient
to
convict.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
we're
relying
on
the
right
to
obtain
that
judgment.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
sneed,
which
we
referred
to
in
our
supplemental
brief
for
certiorari,
there
was
an
appeal
of
a
conviction.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
it's
in
our
supplemental
brief,
your
honor.
it's
a
fifth
circuit
case.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
there
are
other
cases
like
it...
bodey,
et
cetera.
there's
an
appeal
from
a
conviction,
claim
trial
error,
insufficient
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
trial
error.
the
government...
the
defendant
went
back
and
said
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
consider
the
insufficient
evidence.
i
have
a
right
to
bar
of
double
jeopardy.
now,
the
defendant
in
that
case
claimed
just
a
bar
of
double
jeopardy
because
of
the
prior
proceedings
he
said
it
was
insufficient
evidence.
now
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
there
was
no
conviction
and
there
was
no
acquittal.
there
was
no
judgment
indicating
an
acquittal
or
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
now
he
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
noticed
their
prior
becton
and
rey
cases,
and
they
said
well,
there
we
said
no.
although
now
we
say
yes,
it
appears
that
the
third
circuit
probably
properly
criticized
our
prior
holdings.
and
the
court
said,
significantly,
we
could
not
and
do
not
now
reconsider
our
refusal
to
address
the
insufficiency
issue.
this
is
a
separate
appeal
grounded
in
double
jeopardy
because
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial
was
insufficient.
we
have
no
judgment
of
conviction.
we
have
no
acquittal.
we
have
nothing,
and
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
it
may
be,
but
it's
one
of
the
cases
i'm
relying
on.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
have
jurisdiction
and
overturned
the
conviction,
finding
in
fact
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
before
the
second
trial.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
it
was
strictly
an
interlocutory
double
jeopardy
appeal,
the
very
thing
we
have
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
context
is
no
different.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
trial
court?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--but
we
did
make
such
a
motion.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
we
did.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
right.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
this
limited
context.
let
me
make
this
clear,
your
honor.
one
of
the
elements
of
this
claim
is
there
has
to
be
a
certain
amount
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
attorney
raising
this
issue.
we
have
to...
in
other
words,
we
would
not
have
made
this
claim
if
we
didn't
believe
in
good
faith
that
to
file
this
interlocutory
appeal
the
evidence
was
not
insufficient.
we
believed
it
was
insufficient.
we
briefed
it
extensively
and
the
government
response
is
well,
it's
sufficient,
citing
no
cases,
not
analyzing
the
evidence,
and
doing
nothing
to
really
join
issue
with
us
on
the
matter.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
in
this
case
it
was
judge
johnson.
she
was
in
the
position
to
appraise
the
evidence,
but
did
so
incorrectly.
judges
do
it
from
time
to
time.
they
will
incorrectly
appraise
the
evidence.
but
let
us
not
forget
in
viewing
the
record
we
view
it
under
the
glasser
standard,
viewing
the
evidence
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
government,
giving
the
benefit
of
every
inference
available,
without
regard
to
the
credibility
of
witnesses,
and
on
that
glasser
standard,
which
i'm
very
familiar
with,
we
say
the
evidence
here
failed
to
reach
the
threshold
of
submissibility
to
the
jury.
and
just
like
in
burks.
your
honor
said
well,
if
the
judge
in
burks
has
submitted,
had
acted
properly,
he
would
have
acquitted
the
defendant.
similarly,
if
the
judge
in
richardson
had
acted
properly,
she
would
have
acquitted
the
defendant
and
why
should
we
be
in
a
worse
stead,
why
should
we
be
prejudiced?
why
should
we
be...
come
out
the
loser,
so
to
speak,
because
the
judge
erred?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
court
of
appeals
said--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--all
right.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
then
i'm
in
a
great
deal
of
difficulty.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
you
will
never
reach
it;
that
is
correct.
we're
out.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
although...
we
have
an
anomaly
under
your
honor's
hypothesis.
the
anomaly
would
be
this:
although
the
court
has
time
and
time
again
said
that
at
the
core
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
the
notion
that
the
government,
after
a
full
and
fair
effort
or
opportunity
to
present
its
case,
and
it
fails,
fails
to
meet
the
threshold
of
glasser,
then
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
government
has
no
right
to
successive
prosecutions.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
burks
admittedly
overruled
other
precedent.
it
created
new
learning,
new
concept,
and
it
provided
later
insights
into
what
had
previously
not
been
understood.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
we
know
that
logic
may
not
be
the
life
of
the
law.
we
think
that
in
this
particular
regard
that
to
deny
this
defendant
his
rights
would
do
what
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
said
cannot
be
done.
the
bottom
line
is
the
government
has
no
right,
should
not
have
the
right,
to
reprosecute
a
defendant
that
it
has
not
mustered
enough
evidence
to
convict.
that,
to
us,
is
the
bottom
line.
now,
while
the
procedural
context--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--it
has
not
reprosecuted
this
man.
that's
our
claim;
it
has
no
right
to
reprosecute
him.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
trial
date
has
been
set.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
depends
on
the
conceptual
framework
in
which
you
look
at
it.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
mere
fact--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--of
course
not,
but
the
mere
fact
that
the
insufficient
evidence--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--where
there
was
an
appeal
in
this
context?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
case
that
we
refer
to,
the
sneed
case,
justice
stevens--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--but,
your
honor,
the
conceptual
framework
of
the
conviction
was
it
was
overturned,
but
the
court
never
considered
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
no,
i
disagree
with
that
entirely.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
the
sneed
case
supports--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--the
one
i
just
referred
to
supports
us
100
percent.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
yes.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
not
really,
for
the
reason
that--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--the
conviction
was
overturned
for
trial
error.
at
that
point
there
was
no
conviction,
there
was
no
acquittal.
there
was
nothing.
you
just
had
a
record
of
the
first
trial.
that's
pretty
similar
to
our
case,
in
which
you
just
have
a
hung
jury.
he
then
filed
a
double
jeopardy
motion,
denied,
interlocutory
appeal.
the
fifth
circuit
said
we're
going
to
entertain
that
motion
now
interlocutory...
interlocutorially
because
under
burks
it
does
raise
a
claim
the
government
has
no
right
to
reprosecute,
reviewed
the
evidence,
found
insufficiency,
reversed.
to
me
that
is
the
same
posture
as
this
case.
i
see
no
difference.
your
honor
may
very
well.
of
course,
your
honor's
going
to
make
the
judgment.
the
question
or
the
answer
to
your
question
is
there
is
no
conceptual
difference
between
the
sneed
case,
bodey,
and
about
three
or
four
circuit
cases,
and
the
case
at
bar.
it
is
precisely
the
same
posture.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
right.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--well,
justice
o'conner,
the
notion
that
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict,
the
trial
lawyer
or
trial
judge
at
first
blush,
you
know,
should
be
another
trial
if
you
have
a
mistrial.
but
our
point
is
that
in
this
limited
context
of
insufficient
evidence,
which
rarely
occurs
in
federal
criminal
prosecution...
i've
seen
three
of
them
in
all
my
experience...
it's
rare
that
the
government
does
not
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
glasser
test.
we're
just
saying
in
this
limited
context
that
when
it
fails
to
muster
its
proof,
regardless
of
what
the
jury
did,
if
the
jury
convicted
we
know
the
result.
why
should
the
result
be
different
if
the
same...
everything
is
equal,
the
same
evidence
has
been
presented,
nothing
changes,
all
facts
being
equal
except
the
jury
instead
of
convicting,
the
same
result...
he
would
have
been
acquitted
thereafter...
if
it
acquitted,
the
same
result,
came
to
the
middle
and
hung,
instead
erring
completely
in
convicting
him
on
insufficient
evidence.
it
came
a
step
closer
to
the
correct
result,
which
would
have
been
an
acquittal.
now
the
government
says
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
have
his
double
jeopardy
claim
or
his
right
not
to
be
retried
and
forced
varies
with
the
jury's
determination.
and
we
know
that
we
give
deference
to
juries.
we
say
they
can
act
without
regard
to
logic.
they
can
act
illogically,
do
what
they
want.
that
being
the
case,
why
should
our
right
not
to
be
retried
hinge
upon
so
tenuous
a
basis
as
the
vagaries
of
what
a
jury
may
do?
we
think
conceptually
this
defendant
had
the
same
right
not
to
be
retried
had
he
been
convicted
or
acquitted.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
well,
the
judge
erred
in
not--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--not
really.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
in
the
federal
context
there
were
58
retrials
after
mistrials
in
the
entire
year
for
which
statistics
were
reported...
58
cases.
and
of
those
the
government
or
the
office
of
the
federal
courts
did
not
distinguish
between
mistrials
based
on
hung
juries
or
mistrials
for
any
reason...
a
juror
going
to
sleep
or
whatever.
of
those
58
cases,
we
think
a
very
small
percentage
will
ever
be
truly
bottomed
on
insufficient
evidence.
as
your
honor
pointed
out--
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
--usually
there's
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
and,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
in
concurring
in
jackson
v.
virginia,
there
are
very
few
insufficient...
true
insufficient
evidence
cases.
but
the
point
is
that
it's
up
to
the
lawyer
as
an
obligation
to
file
a
valid
claim
based
on
the
insufficiency
and
what
it
entails.
you
read
the
briefs.
it's
easy
to
determine,
as
we
see
it.
mr.
allan
m.
palmer
thank
you.
