mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
has
been
no
final
judgment
in
this
case
because
the
jury
was
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
the
issue
is
whether
retrial
must
be
postponed
to
allow
petitioner
to
appeal
the
district
court's
order
denying
his
motion
to
acquit
for
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
for
want
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
i
plan
to
make
three
major
arguments,
first
that
the
order
is
not
appealable
because
it
does
not
fall
within
the
collateral
order
exception
to
the
final
judgment
rule
as
this
court
has
described
in
its
cases;
second,
petitioner's
claim
does
not
in
any
event
sound
in
double
jeopardy
and
thus
the...
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
bar
to
retrial
under
these
circumstances;
and,
third,
that
an
examination
of
the
details
of
petitioner's
claim
reveals
that
his
actual
complaint
was
with
the
trial
judge's
ruling
on
a
matter
of
receipt
of
evidence
and
not
even
insufficiency
as
we
ordinarily
understand
it
and
thus
it
falls
even
more
strongly
that
his
claim
does
not
sound
in
double
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
o'conner--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--first
of
all,
it's
not
a
collateral
issue
because
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
goes
directly
to
the
heart
of
the...
of
the
question
to
be
determined
at
trial,
namely
guilt
or
innocence.
now
my
friend
has
suggested
relying
upon--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
o'conner,
it
is
not
a
collateral
because
a
decision
is
a
decision
on
the
merits,
as
this
court
determined
in
burks.
if
the
court
determines
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
that
is
the
equivalent,
operative
equivalent,
as
the
decision
said,
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
is
in
fact
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
and
that
is
the
principal
question
as
to
whether
it
is
collateral.
now
it's
true
that
in
flanagan
and
in
macdonald
this
court
extended
the
concept
of
being
non-collateral
to
issues
which
were
not
as
directly
related
to
guilt
or
innocence
as
this
and
as
it
is
in
this
case,
and
for
those...
in
those
circumstances
it
is
true
that
looking
to
whether
the
issue
is
one
that
needs
to
be
decided
upon
the
full
record
of
the
case
is
a
useful
test
in
deciding
whether
it
is
so
enmeshed
in
the
factual
merits
of
the
case
that
it
is
not
appealable,
even
though
in
fact,
as
in
the
case
of
disqualification
of
counsel,
it
has
nothing
logically
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence.
but
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
question
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
which
is
the
very
heart
of
the
merits
of
the
case,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
decision
was
collateral.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
rehnquist,
what
was
sought
to
be
appealed
from
here
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
second
trial.
it
was
the
denial
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
in
the
first
trial,
and
that
matter
was
certainly
one
that
went
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
in
that
trial.
now
if
what
you're
concerned
about
is
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
an
appeal
from
an
ultimate
conviction
upon
the
second,
if
petitioner
were
in
fact
retried
and
then
were
convicted,
that
there
might
then
be
an
appeal
upon
that
second
conviction
based
upon
the
insufficiency
in
the
first--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
indeed,
justice
o'conner,
we
still
think
that
that
may...
we
still
believe
that
that
may--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct.
let
me
explain
why
those
positions
are
perfectly
consistent.
the
reason
why
there
is
no--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
reason
why
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
bar
is
that
it
does
not
violate
the
defendant's
double
jeopardy
rights
to
retry
him
after
a
mistrial
where
he
has
not
received
a
judgment
of
acquittal
or
a
functional
equivalent
up
in
an
appellate
court.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct,
whatever
you
may
think
of
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
justice
white,
there
are
cases
in
the
civil
context
where
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply
at
all
where
there
are
mistrials
because
of
hung
juries
and
where
upon
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
in
the
second
trial
the
courts
of
appeals
have
entertained
the
issue
of
whether
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
granted
in
the
first
trial.
they
may
be
correct.
we
think
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
they're
correct,
but
they
may
very
well
be
correct.
but
whether
they
are
correct
or
not
obviously
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
similarly
in
the
criminal
context.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
what
we
have
said
is
that
we
do
not
believe
that
that
point,
which,
incidentally,
was
relevant
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
only
on
the
basis
of
the
third
aspect
of
the
collateral
judgment
doctrine,
which
we
are
not
arguing
here
today.
but
the
point
is
that
they
may
be
correct
or
they
may
not
be
correct,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy.
it
has
to
do
with
whether--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
judgment
by
the
appellate
court
would
constitute
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
and
there
would
not
be--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--there
would
then...
as
of
when--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--at
the
time
it
is
entered,
it
then
bars
retrial.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
certainly
there
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
bar
if
we
sought
to
retry
him
after
the
appellate
court
had
made
that
decision.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
not
necessarily.
he
would
certainly
be--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--because
he
would
have
received
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
for
exactly
the
same
reason
that
a
plaintiff
or
a
party
in
a
civil
case
would
make
the
same
argument.
double
jeopardy
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
question
is
whether
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
in
the
first
trial
constitutes
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
it
does.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
i...
we
are
not
taking
a
position
on
that.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
court
on
review
of
judgment
would
be
able
to
look
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
first
trial.
that
may
very
well
be
correct
for
the
same
reason
that
they
would
be
able
to
do
so
in
the
civil
context.
but
they
would
no
need
to
cite
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
so
doing.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i...
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
is...
the
record
of
the
first
trial
will
be--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
in
a
sense
that's
the
very
question
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
may
imply
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect
on
this
point,
and
they
may
very
well
have
been
incorrect.
but
the
answer
is
the
same
whether
it's
the
civil
context
or
whether
it's
the
criminal
context,
because
the
answer
has
to
do
with
whether
these
issues
are
merged
in
the
judgment--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--let
me
give
you
another
example
that
may--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--my
point
exactly.
therefore,
the
fact
that
the
exact
parallel
exists
in
the
civil
context
indicates
that
the
answer
to
the
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
that
may
very
well
be
the
case,
which
was
why
in
our
footnote
in
our
brief
we
indicated
that
we
were
not
so
convinced
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
contrary.
our
simple
point
in
this
case
is
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
addressing
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
put
to
me
just
prior
to
the
break
to
discuss
for
just
a
moment
what
the
interests
are
of
the
government
in
this
case.
our
interests
in
this
case
are
to
enable
us
to
engage
in
prompt
retrials
at
the
conclusion
of
mistrials,
especially
hung
juries.
now
the
question
of
whether
an
appellate
court
would
be
able
to
reverse
on
the
basis
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
a
first
trial
upon
appeal
from
a
conviction
in
the
second
trial
is
a
question
of
very
little
practical
import
to
the
government,
largely,
incidentally,
because
that
question
is
going
to
be
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact
essentially
the
same
as
the
question
of
whether
the
evidence
in
that
second
trial
was
sufficient,
because
we're
talking
about
two
trials
which
would
be
based
upon
minor
variations
but
essentially
the
same
body
of
evidence.
and
the
government
is
not
particularly
concerned
about
the
additional
prospect
of
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
evidence
of
the
first
trial.
now--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we
agree
that
that's
true
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law,
which
lays
aside,
incidentally,
the
question
of
whether
the
court
would
be
able
to
review
that
as
a
matter
of
one
of
the
many
issues
which
are
simply
merged
in
the
judgment
of
the
second...
of
the
second
trial.
the
fact
that
many
courts
have
found
that
they
are
able
to
reach
the
issue
in
the
civil
context
suggests
that
the
question
remains
open.
we
don't
ask
the
court
to
resolve
that
question
here
because
we
don't...
we
think
it's
a
fairly
difficult
question
of
very
limited,
at
least
to
us,
practical
importance.
but
we're
extremely
concerned
about
the
prospect
of
mistrials
being
interrupted
by
appellate
processes
before
we're
able
to
engage
in
the
retrial
as,
incidentally,
the
speedy
trial
act
requires.
we
would...
we
are
quite
interested
in
being
able
to
schedule
the
retrial
while
the
evidence
is
still
fresh,
while
the
witnesses
are
still
available,
and
while
the
public's
interest
in
justice
can
still
be
vindicated
reasonably
promptly.
and
our
concern
with
this
case
is
that
it
provides
the
opportunity
for
a
notice
of
appeal
to
interrupt
those
processes
in
virtually
every
case
that
ends
in
a
mistrial,
because
as
a
matter
of
practice
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
made
in
virtually
every
criminal
case.
and
that
will
then
involve
the
appellate
court
in
what
can
be
a
very
burdensome
operation
of
reviewing
the
entire
record
to
find
out
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
incidentally
an
effort
which
they're
going
to
have
to
go
through
upon
review
of
the
conviction
in
the
second
trial
anyway.
and
although
the
evidence
may
in
minor
ways
be
different,
the
double
expenditure
of
effort
is
not
one
that
should
be
overlooked.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
it
could,
because
the
question
of
appealability--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
part...
the
only
way
this
court
would
be
able
to
reach
that
issue
is
as
an
aspect
of
appealability.
the
only
reason
why--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
final
judgment
in
this
case.
there
can
only
be
an
appeal
if
petitioner's
claim
fits
within
the
collateral
order
exception
as
explicated
in
abney.
if
his
claim
does
not
even
sound
in
double
jeopardy,
that
is,
regardless
of
whether
the
evidence
was
in
fact
insufficient
to
retry
him
would
not
violate
double
jeopardy,
then
he
has
no
basis
for
an
appeal
under
abney.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
mean,
regardless
of--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--under
abney
a
petitioner
does
not
have
the
right
to
an
immediate
appeal
in
the
absence
of
a
final
judgment
unless
he
has
raised
a
claim
which
sounds
in
double
jeopardy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
believe
that
invocation
of
the
words
"double
jeopardy"
is
what
this
court
meant
in
abney.
we
believe
that
it
meant
a
colorable
claim
of
double
jeopardy
by
which
we
interpret
to
be
a
claim
that
if
correct
on
the
facts
would
in
fact
give
rise
to
a
bar
against
retrial.
and
even
if--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
that's
right.
but
frivolous,
that's...
frivolousness
can
be
on
the
facts
or
on
the
law.
we're
not
asserting
that
the
claim
here
is
frivolous
on
the
facts.
we're
merely
asserting
that
even
if
he
is
correct
on
the
facts
that
doesn't
constitute
a
bar
to
retrial.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but
in
emphasizing
the
practical
importance
of
this
case
in
comparison
to
the
hypothetical
that
we
have
been
spending
time
on
this
morning,
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
ramifications
for
the
state
criminal
justice
process
are
even
larger.
justice
o'conner
alluded
to
this
in
her
discussions
with
my
colleague.
but
in
fact
they
are
even
more...
the
consequences
are
even
greater
than
justice
o'conner
implied,
because
not
only
would
the
federal
habeas
proceedings
be
triggered
by
mistrials
in
the
state
system,
but
they
would
be
triggered
by
convictions
for
trial
error
as
well,
because
if
petitioner
is
correct,
then
whenever
the
trial...
the
state
courts
have
reversed
for
trial
error,
even,
incidentally,
where
they
have
reached
and
affirm
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
it
will
be
open
to
a
petitioner,
to
a
defendant
to
take
this
claim
to
the
federal
habeas
court
claiming
that
if
in
fact
those
courts
had
erred
that
to
retry
him
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
this
is
in
fact
exactly
what
happened
in
the
case
of
delk
v.
atkinson,
where
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
conviction,
expressly
finding
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
justify
going
to
the
jury.
the
federal
habeas
court
blocked
retrial,
disagreeing
with
the
state
court
on
the
issue
of
sufficiency.
the
court
of
appeals
then
agreed
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
act
in
that
fashion,
but
found
that
the
state
court
had
been
right
back
in
the
first
place
on
the
issue
of
sufficiency,
thus
allowing
a
retrial
if,
after
all
those
proceedings,
the
evidence
was
still
available
to
permit
a
retrial
in
any
event.
it's
this
kind
of
squander
of
appellate
resources
and
of
the
ability
to
retry
that
we're
so
concerned
about
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
it's
exactly
what
the
collateral
order,
the
limitations
on
the
collateral
order
exception
to
the
final
judgment
rule
were
intended
to
preclude.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we
would
be
very
satisfied
with
such
a
ruling.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
we
believe
that
in
order...
under
abney
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
basis
for
an
appeal
that
there
had
to
have
been
a
colorable
double
jeopardy
claim.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
i
think
that
there
are
two
reasons.
the
clearest
is
that
it's
not
a
collateral
order.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
because
it's
an
issue
that
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
in
abney
that
second
prong,
the
collateral
prong,
was
described
as...
in
several
different
ways.
i'll
just
read
a
couple
of
them
to
you.
the
elements
of
that
claim
are
completely
independent
of
his
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it's
not
completely
innocent...
excuse
me,
completely
separate
from
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
as
a
practical
matter,
of
course,
that's
not
so
true
in
that
when--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
collateral
order
doctrine
has
a...
has
its
origins
in
practical
considerations
about
how
the
appellate
courts
ought
to
operate,
and
what
you're
talking
about
is
for
the
second
court
to
engage
in
an
examination
of
a
record
which
is
going
to
be
in
all
material
respects,
with
some
minor
variations,
identical.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
in
that
sense,
that's
correct.
but
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
then
what
the
issue...
what
the
second
prong
has
referred
to
when
it
uses
the
word
"collateral".
the
question
there
is
whether
the
issue
is
one
which
is
collateral
to
the
merits,
that
is
to
say
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused.
let
me
give
you
the
example
of
the
very
classic
example
of
the
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
civil
context.
now
whether
that
motion
was
properly
denied
is
totally
independent
in
the
sense
you
used
the
term
of
the
proper
resolution
of
the
case.
nonetheless,
it's
an
issue
which
goes
to
the
merits
and
is
understood
and
always
has
been
as
merged
in
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
fact
that
it
can
be
viewed
independently
does
not
make
it
collateral.
it
is
the
merits
of
the
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
this
is
a
very
similar
situation.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
it's
a
very
practical
problem
and
in
fact
it's
the
problem
in
this
case,
because
when...
and
actually
something
that
we
were
not
aware
of
until
the
petitioner
filed
his
brief
and
actually
laid
out
the
basis
for
his
claim
of
sufficiency.
his
claim
in
this
case
is
that
the
trial
court
erroneously
admitted
certain
hearsay
evidence
and
that
when
the
appellate
court
reverses
that
and
does
not
consider
that
erroneously-admitted
evidence
that
it's
the
remaining
competent
evidence
which
was
insufficient.
we
believe
that
this
is...
this
is
plainly
not
the
sort
of
situation
that
should
lead
to
a
double
jeopardy
bar
or
to
an
interlocutory
appeal.
the
issue
was
technically
left
open
in
a
footnote
in
greene
v.
massey,
but
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
one
that
has
in
fact
been
resolved
by
such
cases
as
tateo
and
burks
itself.
in
burks
it
stated
that
an
issue
of
the
receipt
of
evidence
is
a
matter
of
trial
error.
it's
not
one
that
goes
to
guilt
or
innocence
and
thus
under
burks
would
not
lead
to
preclusion
of
retrial,
which
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
because,
after
all,
when
it's
a
matter
of
trial
error
the
government's
right
to
one
full
opportunity
under
proper
legal
principles
to
obtain
a
conviction
has
not
obtained,
and
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
government
can
retry
after
any
other
trial
error,
it
ought
to
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
and
we
believe
that
the...
we
see
no
exceptions
in
any
of
the
cases
of
this
court
that
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
such
a
claim
would
bar
retrial
and
thus
again
it
does
not
sound
in
double
jeopardy
and
should
not
be
allowed
as
a
matter
for
interlocutory
appeal
or,
in
the
state
context,
a
federal
habeas.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
your
honor
is
perfectly
correct
in
anticipating
the
practical
problems
with
an
opposite
holding
because
were
our
position
not
correct
and
were
the
position
of
this
court
in
tateo
and
burks
not
correct,
it
would
effectively
convert
every
reversal
on
a
matter
of
evidentiary
admission
into
a
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
thus
opening
up
habeas
relief
prior
to
retrial
in
hundreds
or
thousands
of
state
cases.
it
would
be
a
phenomenal
result.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
was
first
filed...
it
was
first
filed
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
let
me...
there
was
a
motion
just
before
that
that's
relevant,
however,
which
was
prior
to
the
close
of
the
government's
case.
the
defendant
moved
to
exclude
certain
evidence,
certain
hearsay
testimony.
the
trial
court
took--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--it
was
first
made--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
was
when
it
was
first
made.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
they
were
not
combined
and
heard
together
until
after
the
case,
because
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
was
repeated
three
times.
it
was
made
first
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
a
second
time
before
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
a
third
time
after
the
mistrial
was
declared.
it
was
at
the
third
time
that
the
petitioner
suggested
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
agreed
that
the
denial
of
that
motion
amounted
to
a
denial
of
his
motion
to
bar
retrial
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
there
was
not.
there
was...
the
motion
to
bar
retrial--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--there
was
a
motion
to
bar
retrial
which
was
denied.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
government
does
not
require
a
motion
to
try.
it's
in
fact--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
government
simply
has...
there's
an
indictment
outstanding
and
after
a
mistrial
the
government
and
the
counsel
for
defense
simply
got
together
with
the
judge
and
agreed
upon
a
new
trial
date,
which
happened
the
very
day
that
the
jury
hung.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
your
honor,
the
defendant
pled
not
guilty
in
pretrial.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
this
is
all--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
appellate
jurisdiction
they
ought
to
be
looked
at,
the
two
motions...
the
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
the
motion
to
bar
retrial...
ought
to
be
considered
separately.
but
for
purposes
of
the
indictment
and
the
plea
of
guilty
and
all
of
the
pretrial
motions
in
this
case
it's
all
one
case.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
all...
there
will
be
a
number
of
pretrial
matters.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
in
this
case,
the
same
judge
was
going
to
try
the
case.
it
could
be
reassigned
to
another
judge,
but
i
think
it's
much
more
common
to
reassign
it
to
the
same
judge.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes,
in
fact
a
new
trial
date
was
scheduled.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it's
the
same
indictment,
the
same
charges,
and
there
has
never
been
a
judgment
in
this
case.
a
case
will
continue
to
go
until
there's
been
a
judgment
of
either
acquittal
or
conviction.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
in
many
respects
it
is
the
same.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
there
will
be
matters
that
were
resolved
pretrial
which
will
continue
to
be
relevant
in
the
second
case.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
