mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
just
briefly
two
characteristics
of
pawtucket's
creche
that
in
our
view
make
it
a
constitutionally
permissible
governmental
acknowledgement
of
an
important
part
of
the
american
culture
and
heritage.
the
first
of
these
characteristics
is
that
this
symbol
is
part
of
a
larger
package.
it
is
not
an
end
in
and
of
itself.
everyone
in
this
case
accepts
the
premise
that
the
celebration
of
christmas
as
a
national
holiday
is
not
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
follows
in
our
view
that
a
non-coercive
acknowledgement
of
this
undisputed
fact...
that
one
of
the
constituent
elements
of
this
recognized
holiday
is
religious...
is
similarly
constitutional.
if
it
is
permissible
for
congress
to
make
christmas
a
national
holiday,
then
it
is
permissible
for
pawtucket
to
announce
the
onset
of
the
holiday,
and
similarly
to
announce
that
one
of
the
constituent
elements
of
that
holiday
is
religious.
christmas
in
this
country
in
1983
means
many
things.
for
the
non-religious
as
well
as
for
the
religious,
it
is
the
most
joyous
of
our
holidays.
regardless
of
one's
religious
beliefs,
christmas
is
a
time
of
homecoming.
it
is
a
time
for
family
and
friends,
for
gifts
and
parties.
it
is
also
a
time
of
good
will,
and
of
concern
for
the
needs
of
our
fellow
human
beings.
it
is
an
eclectic
holiday,
and
it
has
its
symbols.
one
of
those
symbols
is
the
creche,
which
is
a
reminder
that
of
all
the
sources
from
which
the
american
christmas
has
grown
over
the
years,
one
of
them
is
religious.
neither
in
the
christmas
context
nor
any
other
does
the
first
amendment
require
that
we
exclude
enriching
and
important
aspects
of
our
history
and
our
traditions
as
illegitimate
and
therefore
as
non-existent.
it
was
not
by
governmental
decree
that
christmas
acquired
its
religious
aspect.
that
came
about
as
a
matter
of
undeniable
historical
fact,
and
to
deny
its
existence,
to
exclude
it
from
our
national
consciousness
is
nothing
less,
i
submit,
than
intellectual
and
historical
dishonesty.
it
is
cultural
censorship,
if
you
will,
which
is
a
first
amendment
concern,
but
not
because
the
first
amendment
requires
it.
every
single
argument
raised
by
the
lower
courts
and
by
respondents
against
the
creche
are
equally
applicable
to
christmas
itself.
if
christmas
can
survive
the
first
amendment,
as
every
party
to
this
case
concedes
that
it
can,
then
so
can
an
acknowledgement
of
the
fact,
the
undisputed
fact,
that
religion
is
one
of
its
ancestors.
the
in-between
position,
which
would
keep
christmas
as
a
national
holiday
but
force
a
pretention
that
it
is
something
other
than
what
it
is
will
not
withstand
analysis.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
submit,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
test
that
ought
to
be
applied
is
one
that
is
narrowly
tailored
to
the
particular
first
amendment
concerns
of
religious
symbols.
you
could
use
the
three-part
test,
and
we
agree
with
mr.
mcmahon--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
do.
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
keep
that
test
it
would
be
better
to
do
it
that
way,
and
indeed,
i
am
somewhat
sympathetic
with
the
three-part
test,
because
in
attempting
to
articulate
one
of
my
own,
very
often
you
do
come
back
to
these
two
concerns
of
purpose
and
effect.
nevertheless,
i
simply
submit
that
if
you
will
take
a
sample
of
the
efforts
of
other
courts,
state
and
federal,
that
have
grappled
with
this
issue
of
religious
symbols
and
the
first
amendment
in
the
context
of
such
things
as
the
national
motto
and
the
pledge
of
allegiance
and
the
creche
and
a
number
of
other
things,
the
madonna
on
the
seal,
you
come
away,
i
submit,
with
the
unmistakeable
conclusion
that
we
have
really
lost
sight
of
what
the
ultimate
first
amendment
inquiry
is
and
that
these
three
tests
themselves
have
become
the
ultimate
inquiry,
and
the
reason
is
that
they
impart
a
kind
of
an
artificial
objectivity,
and
to
use
justice
powell's
language,
analytical
tidiness
that
in
fact
is
non-existent,
and
they
give
the
impression
of
having
really
accomplished
the
purpose
without
our
ever
examining
what
the
true
first
amendment
values
are.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
a
test,
if
you
want
to
put
it
in
terms
of
purpose
and
effect,
fine,
but
that
it
ought
to
concentrate
on
such
things
as
a
recognition
first
that
it
is
a
symbol,
and
starting
from
that
premise,
ask
yourselves
what
it
is
a
symbol
of,
and
is
it
legitimately
adjunct
to
something
else,
rather
than
being,
is
it
promotional
or
is
it
merely
commemorative.
and
the
final
question
that
i
would
ask
is,
is
it
coercive?
now,
with
respect
to
the
creche,
i
submit
that
of
all
of
the
possible
symbols
that
government
might
have
selected
or
that
might
be
used
by
government,
the
least
potential
for
coerciveness,
or
that
there
is
none
that
has
less
potential
for
coercion
than
does
the
symbol.
i
like
the
use
of,
say,
an
anthem,
or
an
oath
of
office,
or
a
pledge,
of
allegiance
whose
religion-acknowleding
words,
the
individual
must
either
affirmatively
state
or
be
noticed
for
declining
to
do
so.
the
presence
of
an
outdoor
creche
leaves
the
individual
completely
free
to
react
to
it
however
he
or
she
pleases
without
anyone
else
knowing
what
that
reaction
is.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
primary
issues
presented
by
the
creche
are...
we
pidgeonhole
them,
we
categorize
them
as
establishment
clause
issues.
but
this
court's
decisions
make
it
very
clear
that
in
deciding
establishment
issues,
free
exercised
values
are
nevertheless
very
relevant
and
should
not
be
ignored.
the
creche
is
one
that
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
where
it
is
governmentally
sponsored?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
a
hypothetical
that
is
much
harder
than
this
one.
it
is
one
that
tests
the
outer
limits
of
my
theory,
but
i
would
answer
it
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
my
view,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
certainly
less
symbolic
than
is
this
case.
now,
in
that
case,
marsh
versus
chambers,
which
we
of
course
supported
with
an
amicus
brief,
there
was
an
additional
concern,
which
was
mainly
historical,
and
the
court
reached
the
right
result
in
that
case
relying
on
historical
considerations,
and
i
might
point
out
in
that
respect
that
in
marsh
versus
chambers,
the
court
very
properly
did
not
apply
the
three-way
test.
it
could
have
done
so,
and
i
submit
that
the
reason
that
that
approach
was
sound
was
simply
that
the
three-part
test
is
just
not
all
that
helpful
in
deciding
the
constitutionality
of
chaplains'
prayers,
and
the
same
is
true
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
with
that
degree
of
specificity,
justice
o'connor.
let
me
just
submit
finally
that
to
the
extent
the
first
amendment
is
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
it
favors
pawtucket's
right
to
continue
to
do
what
it
has
done
for
almost
half
a
century.
no
one
in
this
case
is
contending
that
christmas
itself
must
be
disestablished
as
a
national
holiday,
and
neither
is
anyone
denying
that
one
of
the
elements
of
this
holiday
is
religious.
the
first
amendment
not
only
does
not
require,
it
would,
i
submit,
be
positively
offended
by
a
ruling
that
would
say
to
the
city
of
pawtucket,
yes,
you
may
announce
christmas
in
every
respect
except
for
one.
the
one
thing
you
may
not
announce
is
that
christmas
has
anything
to
do
with
the
birth
of
christ.
that
would
make
the
acceptability
of
the
announcement
turn
on
its
content,
more
specifically
on
its
lack
of
religious
content,
in
clear
violation
of
first
amendment
principles.
for
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing.
