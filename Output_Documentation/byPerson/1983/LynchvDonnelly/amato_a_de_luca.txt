mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
cross,
the
nativity
scene
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
religious
symbols
in
this
country,
and
most
certainly
one
of
the
most
powerful
christian
religious
symbols
in
this
country.
it
is,
as
all
of
the
parties
agree
and
acknowledge,
the
biblical
account
of
the
birth
of
christ,
the
christian
messiah,
the
redeemer,
according
to
the
gospels
of
matthew
and
luke
as
contained
in
the
new
testament.
pawtucket's
purchase,
the
maintenance,
and
the
erection
of
the
fundamental
christian
symbol
involves
government
in
religion
to
a
profound
and
substantial
degree.
it
has
aligned
itself
with
a
universally
recognized
religious
symbol
and
belief.
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
although
the
religious
symbol,
the
creche,
is
contained
in
a
display
that
is
on
private
property...
it
is
owned
by
the
slater
museum
historical
society...
it
is
adjacent
to
the
city
hall.
city
hall
is
approximately
100
feet
away
from
this
area.
also,
the
creche
and
the
display
itself
is...
there
is
a
ceremony
that
is
held
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
pawtucket
each
year,
a
lighting
ceremony,
which
announces
the
commencement
of
the
display
in
the
hodgson
park
area.
the
music
that
is
played
at
the
display
is
the
same
music
that
is
also
played
inside
of
city
hall,
and
all
of
the
festivities
that
take
place
at
the
display
and
at
city
hall
are
paid
for
and
sponsored
by
the
city
of
pawtucket.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
i
think
that
in
the...
i
think
that
in
understanding
that
the
city
owns
all
of
the
symbols
and
all
of
the
artifacts
that
are
contained
in
this
display,
and
assuming
that
that...
the
creche
were
purchased
and
paid
for
privately
without
any
other
explanation
that
it
is
private,
then
i
think
it
would
still
violate
the
establishment
clause
for
the
first
amendment,
because
there
is
no
indication
to
anyone
looking
at
that
that
the
display
or
the
creche
is
not
part
of
the
broader
display
which
is
put
up
and
sponsored
by
the
city.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
think
that
prayer
is
purely
symbolic,
and
i
think
this
court
made
that
observation
in
marsh
versus
chambers,
in
conjunction
with
relying
on
the
unique
history
that
this
court
found
to
be
applicable
to
the
prayer
in
nebraska
and
generally
in
legislatures
and
in
congress.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
when
the
chaplain
begins
his
invocation,
i
think
it
serves
two
purposes.
one,
it
gets
the
attention
of
the
individuals
who
are
presumably
beginning
the
session,
and
two,
it
is
simply
a
formalized
way
of
commencing
the
session,
asking
people
to
meditate,
to
begin
to
experience
and
indeed
appreciate
the
seriousness
with
which
they
must
approach
the
business
that
is
going
to
be
before
them
today
as
congressmen
and
congresswomen,
and
i
think
that
is
the
primary
purpose
of
that
kind
of
invocation
in
that
setting.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
it
most
certainly
is
an
acknowledgement
of
a
religious
faith.
i
have
to
admit
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
however,
there
is
a
big
difference
between
an
acknowledgement
of
religion
without
actually
sponsoring
a
religious
point
of
view
as
opposed
to
in
this
particular
case,
where
we
are
not
only
acknowledging
religion,
but
we
are
acknowledging
a
particular
form
of
religion,
notably
christianity.
i
do
not
think
anyone
can
argue
that
the
nativity
scene
does
not
depict
the
historical
birth
of
christ.
we
all
acknowledge
that
christ
was
born
approximately
2,000
years
ago.
what
the
nativity
scene
does,
it
acknowledges
the
divinity
of
christ.
it
acknowledges
that
the
christian
messiah
has
come,
and
that
in
conjunction
with
easter,
i
think,
in
biblical
terms
any
way,
is
indicative
of
and
personifies
precisely
what
christians
believe,
to
the
exclusion
of
course,
of
all
the
non-believers
and
those
individuals
who
do
not
have
christian
philosophy
or
religion.
approximately
one
week
after
this
suit
was
filed,
there
was
a
press
conference
held
at...
in
the
display,
in
front
of
the
nativity
scene.
a
podium
was
erected
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
holding
this
press
conference.
the
press
conference
was
called
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
pawtucket,
mr.
lynch.
at
that
press
conference,
mr.
lynch
made
it
clear,
and
present,
of
course,
were
the
media.
there
were
a
group
of
school
children
that
came
down
from
a
nearby
public
school
along
with
their
teacher,
and
a
variety
of
other
individuals
who
had
stopped
to
listen
to
the
mayor
give
his...
or
begin
his
press
conference.
this
was
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon.
at
that
press
conference,
he
avowed
publicly
and
was
reportedly
widely
in
the
media,
in
the
newspaper
and
on
television,
that
he
was
going
to
fight
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
order
to
keep
christ
in
christmas.
the
purpose
of
the
mayor's
statement
and
its
effect
was
clearly
religious
and
clearly
christian,
and
the
message
was
heard
and
was
echoed
by
the
many
letters
which
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
by
the
many
letters
both
from
people
in
pawtucket,
outside
of
pawtucket,
and
from--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--well,
he
may
not
have
done
that
if
it
hadn't
been
challenged,
if
the
suit
had
not
been
filed,
but
i
think
it
is
indicative
of
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
erection
of
that
display,
of
the
creche.
the
fact
that
he
believes
that
the
creche
should
be
continued
as
part
of
the
display
because
what
we
are
trying
to
do
and
what
we
will
be
doing
is
to
fight
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
all
of
the
non-believers
and
atheists
to
keep
christ
in
christmas,
that
goes...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
when
the
mayor
took
the...
when
the
mayor
as
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
pawtucket,
as
the
elected
official
of
all
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
pawtucket,
believers
and
non-believers,
christians
and
non-christians,
stood
before
the
nativity
scene
in
an
orchestrated
press
conference
to
announce
that
he
was
going
to
fight
to
keep
christ
in
christmas,
i
think
that
the
effect...
it
can
be
fairly
inferred
that
the
effect
of
that
press
conference
was
to
suggest
that
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
that
is,
what
the
people
who
brought
this
suit
are
trying
to
do
is
take
a
religious
symbol
away
from
the
majority
of
the
people
who
happen
to
believe
that
christmas
is
for
christ,
and
anyone
who
is
against
that
is
against
what
the
majority
of
the
citizens
of
pawtucket
believe.
i
don't
believe
that
he
was
engaging...
or
announcing
that
he
was
engaging
in
warfare,
but
i
do
believe
that
he
announced--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--do
i
think...
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
brought
the
mayor's
press
conference
to
your
attention
because
i
thought
it
was...
had
some
probative
value,
but
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
that
in
spite
of
the
mayor's
publicly
avowed
purpose
of
the
creche
in
the
christmas
display--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--the
city
at
the
trial
offered
three
other
reasons
for
the
inclusion
of
the
nativity
scene
in
the
annual
christmas
display.
the
first
was
economic.
the
second
was
cultural
and
traditional,
and
the
third
was
aesthetic.
the
district
court,
since
there
was
no
evidence
offered
as
to
the
aesthetic
value
of
the
creche,
made
a
finding
that
there
was
obviously
no
evidence
to
support
that
position.
he
went
on
to
address
the
issues...
the
reasons
of
economic,
cultural,
and
traditional.
the
district
court
found
in
applying
the
secular
purpose
test
that
the
city's
own
witnesses...
they
had
two
witnesses,
two
merchants
testify,
and
they
admitted
that
the
deletion
of
the
creche
from
the
display
itself
would
have
no
economic
impact
on
the
downtown
area,
the
commercial...
the
commercial
area
of
pawtucket.
one
of
the
reasons,
obviously,
that
the
city
gave
for
including
the
creche
was
because
it
attracted
shoppers.
these
individuals
readily
admitted
that
that
was
not
the
case.
also,
as
it
related
to
the
cultural
and
traditional
reasons
advanced
by
the
city,
the
district
court
found
that
the
primary
purpose
and
effect
of
the
nativity
scene
was
to
advance
religion.
relying
on
the
testimony
and
exhibits,
the
court
found
no
evidentiary
support
for
the
cultural
and
traditional
reasons
advanced
by
the
city.
indeed,
the
court
found
that
the
evidence
supported
a
contrary
conclusion.
more
particularly,
the
court
made
a
finding
that
as
far
as
cultural
and
traditional
were
concerned,
the
city
made
no
attempt
to
disclaim
the
religious
meaning
of
the
creche,
and
in
addition
to
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
allegation
that
it
had
been
a
tradition
in
pawtucket
to
have
this
type
of
display
or
similar
religious
displays
erected
over
the
last
40,
50,
or
60
years,
or
within
the
history
of
the
city
of
pawtucket.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
don't
disagree
that
it
has
been
displayed,
justice
o'connor,
since
1973
in
its
present
locale.
i
agree
with
that.
what
i
am...
what
i
am
suggesting
to
you
is
that
there
was
no
evidence...
the
city
made
the
allegation
that
they
were
merely
acknowledging
a
cultural
and
traditional
aspect
of
the
citizens
of
pawtucket.
this
is
the
only
holiday
that
the
city
of...
only
religious
holiday
that
the
city
of
pawtucket
has
acknowledged
culturally
or
traditionally,
and
the
district
court
made
that
finding.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
believe
that
was
on
the
elipse
across
the
street
from
the
state...
in
any
event,
it
was
on
public
property,
and
i
believe...
it
was
my
understanding,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
property
has
been
used
traditionally
or
historically
as
a
place
where
people
can
express
their
principles,
beliefs,
or
non-beliefs,
so
that
in
that
context
i
think
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
have
a
mass
being
said
by
the
pope,
because
i
think
that
in
a
sense,
that
that
was
an
establishment
or
sponsorship
of
religion,
but
at
least
the
argument
there
that
could
be
made
is
that
it
was
a
forum
that
was
provided
to
all
people,
regardless
of
their
beliefs,
regardless
of
their
principles,
as
opposed
to
a
specific
sponsorship
of
a
religious
symbol,
as
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
no,
i
don't
think
it's
all
right
to
put
a
creche
over
on
the
mall.
i
think
what
we
have
to
look
at
is--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--the
difference--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--well,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the...
as
the
district
court
did
in
this
case,
the
factual
setting.
we
have
to
go,
as
this
court
must
do
if
it
is
going
to
apply
the
lemon
versus
kurtzman
test,
is
look
at
the
factual
setting,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
erection
of
the
creche,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
papal
mass,
or
any
other
religious
symbol
that
would
be
displayed
or
enacted,
performed
on
public
property.
we
just
can't
look
at
it
in
a
vacuum
and
say
that
it
is
okay
or
it
is
not
okay.
we
have
to
look
at
it
more
in
terms
of
the
circumstances
evolving
from
the
use
of
the
mass
or
the
symbol.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
yes,
it
was,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
think
that
i
would
argue
respectfully
that
it
could
create
or
did
create
excessive
government
entanglement
insofar
as
the
government's
relationship
with
a
religious
group,
most
notably
the
roman
catholic
church.
but
i
think
that
the
police...
and
i
may
be
incorrect
in
my
assumptions,
but
i
believe
that
the
costs
for
the
papal
mass,
the
erection
of
the
altar
and
the
podium
and
a
variety
of
other
costs
that
were
incident
to
the
mass
was
paid
for
by
the
roman
catholic
diocese.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
that's
correct.
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
there
also
as
it
relates
to
the
question
of
free
exercise,
accommodating
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
and
of
course
this
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions
that
there
is
sometimes
a
clash
between
free
exercise
and
the
establishment
clause,
and
under
the
circumstances,
it
may
be
appropriate,
under
certain
circumstances
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
establishment
clause
in
certain
situations
to
give
way
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
so
that
people
can
practice
their
religion
without
interference
from
government.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
i
think...
i
have
two
answers
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
first,
i
think
that
the
district...
and
i...
not
think,
i
know
that
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
setting
that
the
creche
appeared
in
was
supportive
of
its
meaning.
there
was
testimony
from
a
child...
not
a
child,
a
clinical
psychologist
by
the
name
of
wurley
who
said
that
a
display
of
this
type
which
contains
disney
characters,
robots,
santa
claus,
candy
being
given
out
to
children,
a
talking
wishing
well,
is
magical.
it
is
magical
to
children.
it
is
designed,
it
is
intended
to
attract
children,
and
once
the
children
are
there,
then
of
course
as
this
witness
testified
it
has
a
significant
impact
on
that
child,
and
if
you
are
a
non-christian
child
looking
at
this
display,
and
if
you
are
a
non-christian
child
looking
at
the
nativity
scene
contained
in
this
display,
realizing
it
is
supported
by
the
city
of
pawtucket,
government-supported,
then
it
raises
the
question
for
the
child
and
for
that
child's
parents
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
okay,
because
they
are
not
part
of
the
culture
that
is
being
represented.
it
raises
the
question
for
the
child
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
normal
because
they
are
not
part
of
or
do
not
believe
in
the
religious
symbol
that
is
being
displayed
in
this
display,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
secular
symbols
take
away
from
the
religious
meaning
and
the
religious
intent
of
the
nativity
scene,
no
more
than
the
nativity
scene
infuses
any
one
of
those
secular
symbols,
santa
claus,
the
talking
wishing
well,
or
the
reindeers,
with
a
religious
meaning
of
its
own
merely
because
the
nativity
scene
is
close
to
it
by
its
proximity.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
no,
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
i
think
that
the
primary
purpose
in
displaying
religious
artifacts
in
a
museum
is
to
educate.
the
city
in
displaying
artifacts
which
may
include
religious
artifacts
did
not
necessarily--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--well,
but
i
think--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--but
the
setting
is
completely
different
in
a
museum
as
it
is
from
the
display
in
pawtucket.
the
display
in
pawtucket
is
designed
to
attract
children,
to
entice
them,
to
make
it
appear
with
disney
characters--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--yes,
but
not
in
the
same
way.
museums
are
designed
to
educate
children.
the
displays
are
designed
to
entertain
children.
at
the
same
time
as
they
are
being
entertained,
they
are
also
being
exposed
to
a
symbol
that
has
very
significant
religious
significance.
so
i
think
there
is
a
clear
difference
between
the
museum,
just
as
this
court
in
schemp
made
the
distinction
between
having
a...
bible
readings
take
place
in
the
morning
as
opposed
to
utilizing
the
bible
as
an
educational
tool.
certainly
the
teacher
could
utilize
the
bible
to
inculcate
religion
during
the
course
of
the
day.
however,
in
the
setting
that
the
bible
was
utilized
in
schemp,
this
court
made
the
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
and
i
think
that
it
is
analogous,
that
is,
this...
our
case
is
analogous
to
that
in
terms
of
the
setting
that
it
is
depicted
in.
realizing
that
this
court
must
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
to
the
district
court's
findings,
the
city
articulates
two
other
arguments.
one
is
contextural
and
one
is
historical,
and
i
believe
that
i
have
touched
on,
in
answering
some
of
your
questions,
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
city
as
it
relates
to
contextural.
i
would
like
to
say
that
as
it
relates
to
the
historical
argument,
justice
o'connor
presented
a
hypothetical
to
counsel
which
i
think
is
very
relevant
to
this
case.
if
in
fact
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
pawtucket
or
the
government
of
pawtucket
can
erect
a
nativity
scene
as
it
has
in
this
case,
then
in
order
to
celebrate
a
religious...
or
a
holiday
which
they
allege
has
become
secularized,
and
because
of
the
secularization
of
the
holiday,
a
religious
symbol
is
no
longer
religious,
even
though
its
origin
is
religious,
then
why
cannot
the
city
if
at
some
point
in
time
easter
is
declared
a
national
holiday,
or
before
easter,
on
good
friday,
when
schools
are
let
out,
when
businesses
are
closed,
why
would
not
the
city
be
allowed
to
erect
in
a
secular
setting
a
cross
or
a
crucifix?
why
not
display
easter
bunnies
and
painted
eggs
and
tulips,
which
are
indicative
or
represent
the
secularization
or
the
secular
side
of
easter
along
with
the
erection
of
a
crucifix,
since
the
crucifix
really
is
the
reason
that
easter
is
being
celebrated?
and
i
think
that
that
example
or
that
hypothetical
really
presents
to
the
court
some
very,
very
difficult
questions
if
it
decides
that
the
nativity
scene
should
not
be
taken
out
of
this
display,
because
what
will
happen,
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
will
really
be
to
open
pandora's
box.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
it
would
be
my
suggestion
that
it
would
not
be
permitted,
that--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--no,
that
is
why
this
case
is
here.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
i
wouldn't--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--based
upon...
the
direct
answer
is
no.
based
upon
the
decisions
that
this
court
has
rendered,
my...
i
would
feel
very
strongly
that
such
a
display
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
just
as
the
nativity
scene
is
in
this
context.
but
it
opens
the
door.
it
opens
the
door
to
a
variety
of
problems
for
this
court,
for
the
courts
of
this
country,
because
if...
the
simplest
solution
to
this
problem,
and
i
am
not
by
saying
it
is
simple
suggesting
that
it
is
insignificant,
or
that
this
case
is
insignificant,
but
the
simplest
solution
to
this
problem
is
to
say,
enough,
this
is
where
we
draw
the
line,
because
if
the
line
isn't
drawn
here,
then
groups
all
over
this
country
would
have
the
right
to
come
into
government,
to
the
executive
branch
of
government
and
say,
i
want
to
celebrate
my
religious
holiday,
and
i
want
you
to
financially
support
a
symbol
that
i
feel
is
significant
to
me
in
the
celebration
of
my
religious
holiday.
and
if
that
happens,
then
this
court
and
the
courts
in
this
country
will
be
inundated
with
suits
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
if
the
creche
is
owned
by
the
city
of
pawtucket,
yes,
it
would
be
illegal,
because
it
is
an
acknowledgement
of
a
religious
symbol.
it
is
an
acknowledgement
of
a
religious
belief.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
i
don't
think
the
obscurity
of
the
symbol
has...
with
all
due
respect,
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
government
is
sponsoring
or
advancing
religion.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
as
a...
with
a--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
then
what
we
need
in
order
to
interpret
those
three
symbols
or
four
symbols,
the
three
wise
men
and
the
star,
is
a
key.
there
is
a
secondary
meaning
to
those
symbols.
the
star
in
and
of
itself
has
no
religious
significance
whatsoever.
in
order
for
me
to
understand
that
that
is
a
star--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--with
the
exception
of
the
child,
the
baby
jesus
in
the
manger,
and
the
two...
and
the
virgin
mary
and
st.
joseph.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
well,
it
could
be,
but
the
difference
between
the
nativity
scene
and
separating
each
one
of
those
symbols
and...
is
that
in
order
to
appreciate
the
religious
significance
of
the
star,
for
example,
as
i
started
to
say,
you
need
a
key
to
unlock
the
religious
significance
of
the
star.
it
could
mean
a--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--no--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--no--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--well,
with
all...
i
would
beg
to
differ,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
the
record
supports
that
there
is
something
very
different
about
the
creche.
the
people
who
are
contained
in
the
creche,
the
symbols,
the
three
wise
men,
the
shepherds,
are
all
kneeling
in
adoration
of
the
child,
and
the
district
court
made
those
specific
findings,
that
the
creche...
in
looking
at
the
creche
you
can
have...
no
other
reason
or
interpretation
could
be
gleaned
from
viewing
the
creche,
that
here
is
a
religious
symbol
that...
and
that
is
personified
or
represented
by
the
adoration
and
the
worshipful
positions
that
are
taken
by
the
symbols
in
the
display,
so
that
the
creche
by
itself,
i
think,
would--
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
--well,
i
think
that
the
creche,
and
the
creche
in
this
case,
and
any
creche
that
i
have
ever
seen
would
lend
credence
to
the
position
that
it
is
not
temporal
but
in
fact
worshipful,
that
the
appearance
of
the
figures
in
the
display
are
in
a
worshipful
position,
and
not
simply
kneeling
down
for
convenience
or
for
comfort.
they
are
there
to
adore
the
christian
messiah.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
for
someone
who
knows
nothing
about
christianity?
then
i...
if
someone
has
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
the
birth
of
christ
and
of
christianity's
beginnings,
and
looking
at
this
particular
display
by
themselves,
i
think
that
they
could
import
or...
the
display
would
import
some
religious
or
have
some
religious
overtones.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
yes?
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
no,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
in
my
view.
i
believe
that
the
ten
commandments
as
contained
in
the
frieze
in
this
courtroom
is
not
put
there
to
advance
religion.
i
believe
that
it,
in
conjunction
with
other
aspects
of
the
freeze,
it
is
intended
to
suggest
the
beginnings
of
law,
the
codification
of
law
and
how
it
began.
mr.
amato
a.
de
luca
but
i
think
that
in
this
setting
here
in
this
courtroom,
the
ten
commandments
in
and
of
themselves
do
not
suggest
or
advance
religion,
nor
would
anyone
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
having
the
ten
commandmets
in
this
courtroom
is
this
court's
attempt
to
advance
religion.
conversely,
the
ten
commandments
in
stone
versus
graham,
of
course,
was
found
to
be
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
because
of
its
setting,
and
because
of
the
use
that
it
was
being
put
to.
this
court
found,
as
you
know,
that
the
utilization
of
the
ten
commandments,
even
though
the
avowed
purpose
put
in
there
by
the
school
or
by
the
state
was
merely
to
inculcate
in
children
morals
and
a
knowledge
of
the
ten
commandments,
contained
religious
references
to
god
and
"thou
shalt
not
have
strange
gods
before
me.
"
and
a
variety
of
other
religious
references,
and
on
that
basis
the
court
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
that,
as
i
said
earlier,
ultimately
the
courts
will
be
asked
to
decide
in
each
instance
whether
the
erection
of
various
religious
symbols
are
permissible.
an
affirmance
in
this
case
will
make
clear
to
government,
to
people
of
this
country
of
all
religious
persuasions,
that
sponsorship
of
religious
symbols
is
not
the
business
of
government,
and
that
government
represents
all
people
equally
on
the
basis
of
their
citizenship,
and
not
on
the
basis
of
their
religious
affiliation.
thank
you.
