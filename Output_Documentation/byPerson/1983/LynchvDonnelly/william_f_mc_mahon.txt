mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
establishment
clause
prohibits
a
municipality
from
including
a
creche
in
a
traditional
and
dominantly
secular
christmas
celebration.
the
city
of
pawtucket,
rhode
island,
has
for
over
40
years
sponsored
an
annual
christmas
celebration.
it
consists
of
parties,
christmas
carols,
the
lighting
and
decoration
of
public
buildings,
and
a
display
situated
on
the
grounds
of
a
museum
in
the
center
of
the
commercial
area
of
the
city.
the
display,
which
is
laid
out
over
40,000
square
feet,
consists
of
a
wishing
well,
colored
lights,
a
40-foot
high
lighted
spruce
tree,
figures
of
santa
claus,
a
live
santa
claus,
and
various
figures
of
stars
and
bells
and
lights
and
a
large
season's
greetings,
48
feet
long
and
lighted.
included
in
this
display,
covering
approximately
14o
square
feet
out
of
the
total
40,000
square
foot
area,
is
a
creche.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
yes,
justice,
but
the
display
has
not
been
in
that
location
for
those
40
years.
it
has
been
in
this
location
since
1973.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct,
justice.
the
creche
consists
of
a
small
stable
and
approximately
15
figures
ranging
in
height
from
one
foot
to
five
feet.
the
district
court
has
permanently
enjoined
the
city
from
continuing
its
practice
of
including
the
creche
in
its
christmas
celebration.
it
did
so
by
applying
the
three-part
test
set
forth
by
this
court
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
concluding
that
the
city's
sponsorship
of
the
creche
violated
each
portion
of
that
test.
the
court
of
appeals,
by
divided
vote,
affirmed,
agreeing
with
the
district
court
as
to
the
first
two
parts
of
the
lemon
test,
but
further
invalidating
the
city's
sponsorship
of
the
creche
under
the
strict
scrutiny
analysis
applied
by
this
court
in
larson
against
valente.
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
before
this
court
that
the
public
recognition
of
the
nativity
scene
in
the
american
christmas
is
not
a
promotion
of
religion,
but
really
is
an
acknowledgement
of
the
religious
heritage
of
the
american
christmas.
in
order
to
determine
whether
government--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--a
permanent
injunction
was
issued,
yes,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
the
city
has
not
sponsored
a
creche.
the
city
transferred
the
creche
to
a
private
group
under
a
conditional
agreement
dependent
upon
the
injunction
in
this
case,
and
if
the
injunction
in
this
case
were
to
be
dissolved,
then
the
city
would
reacquire
the
creche.
the
private
group
has
changed
the
location
of
the
creche,
but
it
is
in
the
same
area,
but
the
city
is
enjoined
from
the
practice
of
continuing
it,
and
i
might
note
that
the
record
indicates
that
the
particular
creche
in
question
had
a
useful
life
which
was
close
to
expiring
and
would
probably
have
to
be
replaced
in
any
event.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
this
has
not
been
on
public
property,
chief
justice,
since
1973.
the
property
in
question
is
owned
by
the
slater
mill
museum
corporation,
which
operates
the...
has
restored
the
old
samuel
slater
cotton
mill
and
operates
it
as
a
national
museum.
it
is
submitted
that
in
order
to--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--and
owned
by
the
city,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
yes.
but
in
1981
and
1982,
only
the
secular
portions
of
the
display
have
been
owned
and
maintained
by
the
city.
the
city
has
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
creche
since
this
injunction
was
issued,
and
in
fact
the
creche,
while
still
in
the
same
general
area,
has
been
moved.
it
is
submitted
by
the
city
that
the
distinction
between
the
promotion
of
religion
and
the
recognition
of
religion
must
be
determined
by
examining
the
context
in
which
the
religious
element
is
presented.
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
this
context
the
city
is
celebrating
a
legitimate
national
holiday
and
not
promoting
religious
dogma.
furthermore,
we
will
contend
that
the
lemon
test
was
inappropriately
applied
by
the
courts
below
because
it
was
applied
only
to
the
creche,
as
though
it
existed
in
a
vacuum,
and
it
will
be
our
submission
that
the
appropriate
focus
for
the
lemon
test
should
be
to
the
entire
government
activity
and
not
really
to
the
religious
element
contained
within
it.
this
court
has
frequently
recognized
that
the
traditions
of
the
american
people
are
saturated
with
religious
influences.
as
recently
as
the
end
of
the
last
term,
in
march
against
chambers,
this
court
sustained
legislative
prayer
and
legislative
chaplaincies,
noting
that
they
have
been
imbedded
in
our
traditions
since
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment.
with
respect
to
holidays,
the
thanksgiving
tradition
also
goes
back
to
the
first
congress,
which
requested
president
washington
to
declare
a
day
of
national
prayer
and
thanksgiving.
in
mcgowan
against
maryland,
this
court
held
that
the
recognition
of
sunday
as
a
day
of
rest
was
a
legitimate
public
activity
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
so
doing,
it
was
aiding
religions
who
attract
worshippers
on
that
day
and
who
in
fact
receive
some
substantial
portion
of
their
financial
support
on
that
day.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
specifically,
i
cannot,
justice.
the
recognition
of
christmas
began
in
the
middle
part
of
the
last
century.
1936...
1836
was
the
first
recognition
of
the
legal
holiday.
in
rhode
island
it
was
1852.
it
became
a
federally
recognized
holiday
in
1870,
and
it
was
during
that
period
that
nearly
all
the
states
adopted
christmas
a
legal
holiday,
but
specifically
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
nativity
scene,
we
have
been
unable
to
locate
that
data.
the
creche
is
a
symbol
of
christmas
which
has
been
used
by
the
american
people
together
with
stars
and
bells
and
santa
claus
and
reindeer.
it
has
its
origin--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
well,
of
course,
any
symbol
of
christmas
may
be
used
alone.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
because
that
one
item
cannot
be
properly
evaluated
in
terms
of
what
it
is
doing
without
relating
it
to
the
overall
celebration
of
which
it
is
a
part.
the
creche--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--well,
obviously,
justice,
that
would
be--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--that
would
obviously
be
less
secular
than
the
record
shown
in
this
case.
however,
the
most
important
part
of
the
context,
we
would
submit,
is
christmas
itself,
and
any
symbol
of
christmas,
including
the
creche,
is
a
symbol
of
what
is
a
national
secular
holiday.
a
lone
figure
with
santa
claus
does
not
represent
one
isolated
item
of
christmas.
it
represents
the
entire
christmas
holiday
for
what
it
is.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
stating
that
the
portions
of
the
holiday
celebration
could
be
dissected.
they
are
integrated.
they
become
merged
over
the
years,
through
the
uses
of
the
people.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
my
answer
is,
it
would
still
be
permissible,
justice,
as
a
symbol
of
christmas.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
no,
justice.
i
think
that
in
this
case
it
is
so
clearly
secular
that
the
question
as
to...
the
lone
question
is
not
presented
on
this
record.
however,
were
it
presented,
we
would
submit
that
it
remains
a
legitimate
symbol
of
christmas.
in
this
case,
however,
it
is
so
overwhelmed
by
secular
symbolism
that
the
question
presented
by
justice
o'connor
is
not
before
the
court.
the
christmas
holiday,
although
it
clearly
has
its
origin
in
christmas
observance,
is
a
secular
folk
festival.
the
nativity
scene
is
interwoven
into
the
american
celebration,
but
the
american
celebration
is
a
combination
of
feasting
and
fraternizing
and
music
and
art
and
various
types
of
socializing,
and
the
religious
portion
of
christmas
is
simply
one
component
of
it,
and
it
is
a
component
that
recognizes
its
religious
heritage.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
justice,
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
easter
is
not
a
recognized
public
holiday,
and
the
association
of
a
cross
with
a
specifically
religious
holiday
might
well
implicate
the
promotion
of
religion.
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
even
that
is
probably
less
religious
than
the
thanksgiving
day
established
by
president
washington's
proclamation
in
1789,
but
i
would
say
that
absent
that
historical
base,
the
cross
specifically
at
easter
might
well
be
a
promotion.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
again
it
is
a
matter
of
context,
because
in
the
american
cemetery
in
normandy,
for
example,
there
are...
it
is
filled
with
crosses
and
stars
of
david
and
other
symbols.
the
same
is
true
in
hawaii
on
the
beaches.
in
many
memorial
day
ceremonies
the
cross
and
the
star
of
david
and
other
religious
symbols
are
employed.
so,
we
would
submit
that
in
the
context
which
your
question
poses,
justice,
it
might
well
be
a
promotion,
but
nevertheless
the
cross
and
the
star
of
david
have
legitimate
secular
uses
depending
on
the
context.
we,
of
course,
concede
that
there
are
contexts
in
which
the
creche
itself
used
as
a...
in
a
religious
exercise,
obviously
in
a
church,
the
creche
could
be
a...
its
religious
meaning
could
be
isolated
and
accentuated.
it
is
the
context
which
determines--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--it
is
a
symbol
of
christmas,
justice.
it
is
a
symbol
of
christmas
as
the
other
secular
symbols
are.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
no,
but
christmas--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--christmas
itself--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--christmas
itself
is,
justice,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
the
holiday
of
christmas
is
a
denominational
holiday.
sunday
is
a
denominational
day.
the
recognition
of
sunday
in
mcgowan
against
maryland
was
not
inhibited
by
the
fact
that
sunday
is
a
religious
day
only
for
certain
denominations,
and
it
is
a
benefit
only
to--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--that
is
because
it
is
secular,
justice,
yes.
that
is
because--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--no,
justice,
it
is
a
dominantly
secular
holiday
in
its
contemporary
celebration.
it
has
religious
roots
and
some
religious
components.
the
religious
components
are
part
and
parcel
of
the--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--the
holiday,
justice,
or
the
creche?
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
the
holiday
is
a
dominantly
secular
holiday
with
a
religious
origin
and
some
religious
component.
the
creche
is
a
dual
symbol.
it
is
a
religious
symbol
and
it
is
also
a
holiday
symbol.
which
meaning
predominates
depends
upon
the
setting.
in
a
setting
where
the
religiousity
is
promoted,
then
the
religious
meaning
of
the
symbol
dominates.
in
a
setting--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--oh,
certainly.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
certainly,
justice.
as
is
christmas.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
the
state
is
celebrating
the
traditions
of
the
american
people,
justice.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
well--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--well,
perhaps
in
the
same
way
that
the
practice
of
paid
chaplaincies
is
giving
money
to
subsidize
that
particular
religious
activity.
however,
we
would
say
it
is
not
the
subsidization
of
religion,
but
it
is
the
subsidization
of
a
secular
national
folk
festival
which
contains
a
religious
element.
it
is...
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
applying
the
lemon
test,
it
is
necessary
to
determine
first
what
is
the
government
doing.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
government
is
not
promoting
religion.
the
government
is
celebrating
christmas.
and
in
applying
the
lemon
test
to
the
record
in
this
case,
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
entire
government
activity
and
to
determine
the
function
which
the
creche
plays
in
that
entire
celebration.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
well,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary,
justice,
but
we
feel
that
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
brief
that
the
creche
in
this
case
satisfies
the
lemon
test
because
of
its
secular
content,
but
no,
we
feel
that
the
principles
themselves
are
sufficient
to
validate
this
practice.
under
mcgowan,
under
marsh,
we
feel
that...
and
the
principles
in
the
other
cases
enunciated
by
this
court
we
feel
are
more
than
sufficient
to
sustain
the
activity
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
that
is
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
--because
presumably
this
court
felt
that
the
historical
evidence
rendered
it
unnecessary.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
f.
mc
mahon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
just
as
common
sense
tells
us
that
the
ten
commandment
in
the
frieze
of
this
courtroom
is
not
promoting
religion
but
is
symbolizing
law,
so
on
the
record
in
this
case
common
sense
will
tell
us
that
the
city
is
celebrating
christmas
and
not
promoting
religious
dogma.
the
respondents
in
oral
argument
here
have
stressed
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
religious
element
as
determinative
of
its
constitutional
effect.
that,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
is
precisely
what
the
courts
below
refused
to
do
in
this
case.
the
district
court
stated
that
the
city
was
overemphasizing
the
importance
of
context
in
evaluating
the
constitutional
import
of
a
symbol,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
as
respondent's
argument
has
demonstrated
here
today,
it
is
impossible
to
overstate
the
importance
of
context,
because
context
makes
the
symbol
what
it
is.
in
response
to
questions
of
the
chief
justice,
i
would
submit
that
the
legislative
prayers,
the
public
prayers
of
the
first
congress
and
the
thanksgiving
proclamation
of
george
washington
in
1789
were
anything
but
perfunctory,
and
they
were
in
fact
an
acknowledgement
of
the
religious
content
in
american
life
in
a
very
sincere
and
forthright
manner.
the
heart
of
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case
and
the
decisions
below
is
that
it
is
impermissible
for
government
to
keep
christ
in
christmas.
we
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
it
would
be
impermissible
for
government
to
put
christ
in
christmas,
it
would
be
impermissible
for
government
to
take
christ
out
of
christmas.
the
establishment
clause
requires
strict
neutrality.
christmas
was
put...
christ
was
put
in
christmas
by
the
traditions
of
the
american
people.
this
court
may
recognize
them,
and
the
government
may
recognize
them
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
thank
you.
