unknown
speaker
has
the
creche
been
there
for
40
years,
used
every
year
for
40
years?
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
but
a
creche
has
been
used
for
40
years?
the
record
shows
that?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
curious
as
to
one
fact.
was
a
stay
order
issued
in
this
case,
or
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
still
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in...
this
concerned
1980,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
1981
and
1982
you
had
no
creche?
unknown
speaker
has
it
been
on
public
property
in
the
last
two
years?
unknown
speaker
then
the
city
sponsored
creche
from
1973
up
until
1980
was
basically
not
on
city
property,
but
the
exhibits
were
put
together
by
the
city?
unknown
speaker
and
owned
by
the
city.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcmahon,
is
there
anything
we
can
refer
to
to
let
us
know
how
long
it
has
been
the
practice
in
this
country
for
public
bodies
to
have
nativity
scenes
displayed?
is
there
anything
you
can
cite
to
us
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
haven't
you
noticed
a
lot
of
christmas
celebrations
without
creches?
unknown
speaker
you
keep
saying
they
all
go
along
together.
unknown
speaker
but
this
case
is
not
aimed
at
all
of
the
decorations,
right?
unknown
speaker
this
case
is
aimed
at
one
item.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
talk
about
that
one
item
without
all
of
the
others?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcmahon,
do
you
think
that
for...
a
city
could
display
a
nativity
scene
alone
without
other
displays
such
as
santa
claus
and
christmas
trees
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcmahon,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
supposing
there
was
nothing
but
a
creche?
unknown
speaker
so
then
we
can
ignore
the
remainder
of
the
exhibit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcmahon,
could
the
city
display
a
cross
for
the
celebration
of
easter
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
meaning
does
the
creche
have
other
than
religion?
unknown
speaker
recognized
by
all
religions?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
it
was.
unknown
speaker
it
is
one
religion,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
christmas
itself?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
other
denominations
other
than
christians
don't
give
presents,
drink
liquor,
and
have
a
ball
on
christmas?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
a
minute
ago
you
said
it
was
religious.
now
you
say
it
is
secular.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
according
to
your
argument,
is
it
religious
or
secular?
unknown
speaker
either.
unknown
speaker
it
is
part
religious.
unknown
speaker
according
to
you.
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
is
giving
money
to
a
religion?
unknown
speaker
are
they
religious?
unknown
speaker
they
are
giving
money
to
celebrating
a
religious
event.
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
the
applicability
of
the
lemon
test
here?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
remember,
the
lemon
test
was
not
applied
in
marsh,
very
vigorously,
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--particularly
as
a
historical
approach
anyway.
unknown
speaker
what
test
in
your
view
should
the
court
apply,
mr.
lee,
in
testing
these
things?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
three-part
test
would
perhaps
better
describe
most
of
the
court's
cases
if
we
read
the
purpose
and
effect
together
rather
than
purpose
or
effect?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
the
two
elements
of
your
test,
as
i
understand
it,
are
the
absence
of
coercion,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
recognized
symbol,
and
it
is
part
of
a
larger
package.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
many
people,
going
to
church
or
saying
prayers
and
attending
religious
ceremonies
are
also
part
of
the
christmas
tradition.
would
you
apply
your
test
to
say
an
overt
prayer
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
total
display,
or
saying
mass
in
the
square,
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
governmentally
sponsored,
but
part
of
a
much
larger
display,
and
only
totally
voluntary
and
non-coercive,
and
just
as
part
of
the
symbols
that
many
of
us
respect
very
deeply.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
when
congress
authorizes
the
payment
of
something
like
$30,000
a
year,
i
think,
for
the
chaplain
in
the
house
and
the
chaplain
in
the
senate,
is
that
symbolic
or
is
it
substantive?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
there,
though,
there
was
rather
clear
evidence
of
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
that
kind
of
evidence
here
with
respect
to
display
of
a
nativity
scene?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
deluca,
you
say
that
although
the
property,
the
real
property,
i
take
it,
on
which
the
creche
is
located
is
private,
it
is
only...
it
adjacent
to
city
property.
now,
if
the
city
did
not
own
the
creche
itself,
so
that
everything
that
was
contributed
to
the
display,
including
the
creche,
were
privately
owned,
it
wouldn't
violate
the
first
amendment,
the
fact
that
it
was
right
next
door
to
the
city
hall,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
regard
the
prayer
that
i
spoke
of
to
your
friend
in
the
house
or
the
senate
or
in
any
state
legislature
as
purely
symbolic,
or
is
it
a
matter
of
substance?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
it
purely
symbolic
in
your
view
when
the
chaplain
gets
up
and
asks
for
divine
guidance
on
the
members
of
the
legislative
body?
is
that
your
view,
that
it
is
purely
symbolic?
unknown
speaker
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
religious
faith,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
basically
the
mayor's
reaction
to
something
that
your
clients
had
done,
i
take
it.
is
there
any
reason
to
think
the
mayor
would
have
done
that
had
not
he
been
challenged...
had
not
the
city
been
challenged
in
its
creche
display?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
when
the
mayor
said
he
was
going
to
"fight
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
"
he
was...
you
suggest
he
was
declaring
war
on
non-believers
and
atheists.
i
don't
think
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
as
necessarily
standing
for
non-believers
and
atheists.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
an
opinion
can
be
written
upholding
you
side
without
mentioning
the
mayor?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
are
you
staying
on
it
so
long?
unknown
speaker
well,
excuse
me
for
even
mentioning
it.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
disagree
that
it
had
been
displayed
for
40
years?
unknown
speaker
several
years
ago,
mr.
deluca,
there
was
a
ceremony
held
on
the
mall,
which
is
federal
property,
of
course.
my
recollection
is
from
news
accounts
there
were
200,000
or
300,000
people,
in
any
event
a
great
many
people,
and
the
ceremony
was
presided
over
by
pope
john
paul
ii.
would
you
say
that
was
a
step
toward
or
an
establishment
of
religion
violative
of
the
religion
clauses?
unknown
speaker
then
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
to
put
a
creche
over
on
the
mall?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
a
high
mass
from
a
creche?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
considerable
involvement
of
government
in
that
ceremony,
hundreds
of
extra
policemen
on
duty,
streets
closed
for
traffic
control
purposes,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
that
was
a
considerable
governmental
involvement,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
thousands
of
dollars
involved
in
the
extra
management
problems,
the
policing,
the
traffic
control?
unknown
speaker
mr.
deluca,
do
you
think
that
any
religious
effect
of
the
creche
display
in
pawtucket
was
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
included
the
display
of
a
christmas
tree
and
a
clown
and
a
robot
and
reindeer
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
city
then
could
not
display
religious
paintings
or
artifacts
in
its
museum
under
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
but
according
to
you
the
effect
would
be
the
same,
regardless
of
the
purpose.
unknown
speaker
children
would
come
to
the
museum,
and
be
somehow
induced
to
think
that
the
city
was
supporting
the
religious
symbols
that
were
displayed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
museums
are
developed
to
try
to
entice
and
attract
visitors,
including
children.
unknown
speaker
do
we
know...
do
we
know
that
the
kind
of
display
that
you
just
suggested
at
easter,
on
good
friday,
would
not
be
permitted?
unknown
speaker
has
this
court
ever--
unknown
speaker
--no,
i
am
talking
about
easter
now.
i
am
talking
about
your
easter
analogy.
we
don't
know
whether
that
would
or
would
not
violate
the
religion
clauses,
do
we,
the
establishment
clause?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
judicially.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
deluca,
isn't
that
problem
also
present
in
your
position?
because
we
asked
your
opponent
about,
suppose
there
was
nothing
but
a
creche,
and
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
supposing
the
creche
was
just
one
ornament
on
the
christmas
tree
and
you
could
hardly
see
it
unless
you
looked
very
closely,
would
that
be
illegal?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
so...
if
it
is
so
obscure
that
very
few
of
the
visitors
to
the
scene
even
see
it,
then
how
do
you
distinguish
the
museum
case
where
you've
got
some
religious
paintings
in
the
museum?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
had
three
wise
men
and
a
star
in
one
exhibit,
say?
would
that
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to
have
a
line
drawing
problem
no
matter
what
you
do.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
had
an
exhibit
that
had
not
the
creche
itself,
but
just
three
camels
out
in
a
desert
and
a
star
up
in
the
sky?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lamb
doesn't
have
any
religious
significance,
and
a
barn
doesn't.
i
mean,
you
can
make
the
same
argument
about
all
the
elements
of
the
creche.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
be
any
mother
and
father
in
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
you
need
a
key
for
the
creche.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
every
child
who
has
not
been
brought
up
in
the
christian
tradition
would
understand
its
meaning.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
self-explanatory
about
a
creche
to
somebody,
as
justice
stevens
says,
to
someone
who
has
never
been
exposed
to
the
christian
religion.
unknown
speaker
to
say
someone
is
on
their
knees
certainly
does
not
import
an
exclusively
religious
connotation.
it
could
be
a
temporal
scene.
i
mean,
people
are
on
their
knees
before
kings,
emperors--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
is
probably
true
for
anyone
exposed
to
the
christian
religion,
but
i
think
what
justice
stevens
was
trying
to
ask
you
and
what
i
have
been
trying
to
ask
you
is
for
someone
who
has
not
been
schooled
in
that
religion.
unknown
speaker
mr.
deluca--
unknown
speaker
--would
the
display
up
on
the
frieze
in
this
courtroom
of
the
ten
commandments
be
unconstitutional
then,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
argument,
of
course,
of
the
city,
that
the
display
of
the
nativity
scene
is
there
to
explain
the
origins
of
the
christmas
holiday
observation.
