unknown
speaker
mr.
popofsky,
do
we
find
this
heart
of
the
statute
in
any
one
section
or
subsection?
unknown
speaker
mr.
popofsky,
i
have
the
same
question
really
i
guess
that
justice
rehnquist
has
already
asked.
section
5
starts
out
by
saying
all
power
sales
under
this
act
shall
be
subject
at
all
times
to
the
preference
and
priority
provision
of
the
prior
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
in
section
5
that
mandates
the
allocation
that
you
describe?
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
working
from?
unknown
speaker
(5)(g)(1)
is
on
page
3
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
popofsky,
(5)(a)
does
not
say
that.
perhaps
it
should
maybe
by
implication,
but
it
says
all
power
sales
under
this
act.
it
does
not
make
any
exception.
unknown
speaker
would
you
go
back
a
minute
and
spell
out
a
little
more
what
you
mean
by
preference
attaches
only
at
the
time
the
contract
is
offered?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
right
there
with
just
one
question?
unknown
speaker
under
your
view
of
the
issue
in
the
case
if
your
side
wins
will
the
dsi
customers
get
the
same
or
a
greater
amount
of
power
than
they
would
have
gotten
under
the
prior
law?
unknown
speaker
would
they
not
get
a
little
more
because
they
have
an
additional
protection?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
that
congress
thought
it
would
be
higher,
but
you
are
not
sure
they
were
right.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
if
we
take
your
opponent's
interpretation
of
the
law
they
would
get
the
same
amount
of
power?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
right
to
three-quarters
and
a
possibility
of
more.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ganzfried,
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
this
is
the
only
way
the
statute
could
be
construed,
or
is
the
statute
reasonably
construable
in
another
way?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
bonneville
had
taken
the
course
as
suggested
by
your
opposition,
would
it
have
violated
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
say
it
would
have.
unknown
speaker
your
position
just
is
not
that
the
statute
is
construable
one
way
or
another
and
that
bonneville
chose
one
of
the
reasonable
courses
and
that
we
should
defer.
that
is
not
your
point.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
ninth
circuit's
answer
to...
was
the
ninth
circuit
of
the
view
that
the
statute
had
to
be
read
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
it
just
preferred
to
read
it
another
way.
unknown
speaker
they
seem
to
think
the
statute
was
readable
either
way,
but
that
it
just
preferred
another
reading.
unknown
speaker
mr.
waldron.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
argue
that
section
10
means
that
the
act
that
we
are
construing
here
did
not
change
the
bonneville
act,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
arguing
that
the
act
that
we
are
here
considering
did
not
really
make
any
changes
in
the
bonneville
act,
that
it
presumably
succeeded?
unknown
speaker
to
take
5(d)(1)(b),
which
your
opponents
rely
on,
which
says
the
administrator
shall
offer
in
accordance
with
subsection
(g)
an
initial
long-term
contract
that
provides
an
amount
of
power
equivalent
to
that
which
such
customers
are
entitled.
i
am
sure
you
know
the
provision.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
interpretation
of
the
sort
of
contract
that
the
administrator
was
required
to
offer
under
that
section?
unknown
speaker
but
5(d)(1)(b)
talks
about
an
amount
of
power.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
the
present
act,
now,
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
waldron.
unknown
speaker
supposing
under
the
bonneville
act
which
is
superseded
by
the
present
act
a
dsi
had
a
20-year
contract
for
a
certain
amount
of
power
as
such
a
contract
would
have
been
issued
under
the
bonneville
act,
now
could
a
preference
customer
come
in
during
the
pendency
of
that
20-year
contract
and
say,
look,
we
have
got
a
lot
of
new
people
that
want
electricity;
we
want
you
to
cut
in
on
the
dsi's
contract?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
interested
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
agree
with
your
opponents
then
that
preference
could
not
be
used
to
cut
into
the
rights
of
an
existing
dsi
contract
under
the
bonneville
act?
unknown
speaker
then
are
you
contending
that
you
have
greater
rights
to
interrupt
your
existing
dsi
contracts
than
you
had
under
the
prior
law?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
the
two
answers.
it
seems
to
me
you
told
justice
rehnquist
that
if
you
had
the
situation
we
are
talking
about
you
could
not
have
gotten
the
power
but
that
you
can
get
it
today.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
he
has
made
an
illegal
contract?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
cutting
into
anything.
you
just
want
what
you
were
entitled
to
that
he
contracted
away?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question?
i
may
reveal
my
stupidity,
but
i
have
some
difficulty
really
understanding
this
first
quartile
concept.
is
that
something
that
has
got
a
statutory
foundation?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
how
do
you
know
whether
a
particular
day's
production
is
in
the
top
or
the
bottom
quartile.
unknown
speaker
is
that
one-fourth
every
day
or
the
first
three
months
of
the
year,
or
how
does
it
work?
unknown
speaker
every
day.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
bonneville
says
it
is
congress
that
is
done
what
they
say
they
are
just
carrying
out
the
instructions.
unknown
speaker
didn't
they
have
long-term
contracts
under
the
bonneville
project
act?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
provision
of
the
statute...
i
do
not
have
it
in
mind...
that
says
the
power
shall
be
deemed
to
be
firm
power
for
the
purpose
of
their
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
suggestion
is
that
he
did
not
follow
his
own
testimony.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
anyway
his
successor
then
did
not
act
in--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
waldron,
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
then
was
quite
a
sensible
disposition
of
the
various
issues
of
the
case
including
the
treatment
of
the
question
in
footnote
4
in
a
footnote?
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
was
a
good
opinion,
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
material
treated
in
the
footnote
4
should
not
have
been
in
the
text
at
all.
it
was
just
a
footnote
type
of
item?
unknown
speaker
the
material
in
footnote
4
you
say
was
not
raised
until
petition
for
rehearing?
