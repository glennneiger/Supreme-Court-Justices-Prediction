mr.
james
t.
waldron
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
over
forty
years,
congress
through
three
specific
statutes
required
bpa
to
sell
this
nonfirm
energy
to
my
clients
first.
we
built
our
systems
in
reliance
upon
this
essential
and
longstanding
priority.
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
is
what
you
have
here
is
a
straightforward
question
of
statutory
application.
did
congress
in
the
regional
act
change
this
essential
and
longstanding
priority?
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
no.
let
me
look
at
the
problem
that
congress
faced,
too
much
demand
in
the
northwest,
not
enough
supply.
the
solution
was
not,
as
petitioners
would
suggest,
take
something
from
my
clients
and
give
it
to
them.
the
solution
as
senator
henry
jackson,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
said
was
simply
to
bake
a
bigger
pie
and
for
the
first
time
give
bonneville
the
authority
to
acquire
resources.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
statement
is,
the
act
will
give
bonneville
the
authority
to
buy
power
to
serve
nonpreference
customers
without
offending
the
principles
of
preference.
that
is
what
is
unique
about
this
statute.
that
is
why
it
passed
after
four
years
of
discussion
with
the
regional
consensus.
now
the
answer
to
the
question
posed,
did
congress
change
this,
is
the
simple
and
straightfoward
language
of
the
act,
two
provisions,
one
of
which
justice
stevens
has
already
referred
to.
congress
said
in
straight
language
all
power
sales
shall
be
subject
to
this
priority,
and
later
at
section
10(c),
nothing
shall
abridge,
diminish,
affect,
or
change
in
any
way
whatsoever
this
priority.
what
congress
did
is
bake
a
bigger
pie,
as
senator
jackson
used
that
analogy
in
introducing
the
bill,
drew
a
line
down
the
middle
of
it
and
said,
this
side
is
the
priority
customers...
that
is
why
they
are
supporting
this...
and
this
side
over
here,
we
are
now
going
to
give
bonneville
the
authority
to
buy
resources,
and
that
will
serve
the
needs
of
the
nonpreference
customers
and
provide
rate
relief.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
justice
rehnquist,
bonneville
sells
power
under
two
statutes,
the
bonneville
project
act
and
the
flood
control
act.
it
has
some
dams
that
were
built
by
the
corps
of
engineers
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
act.
those
statutes
also
provide
the
preference
and
priority,
and
that
is
what
section
10(c)
refers
to.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
well,
it
did
not
make
changes
in
the
bonneville
act.
what
it
did
was
add
to
the
bonneville
act.
it
retained
the
priority
of
the
bonneville
act.
it
refers
in
numerous
sections
to
the
federal
base
system.
there
were
federal
resources
in
the
bonneville
project
act
in
place
at
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
act.
those
are
the
resources,
for
example,
that
generate
nonfirm
energy.
what
the
regional
act
did
was
add
to
that
and
for
the
first
time
give
bonneville
the
authority
to
buy
power.
then
when
it
gave
bonneville
that
authority
to
buy
power
in
specific
sections
it
basically
told
bonneville
how
much
through
sections
5(b),
(c),
and
(d).
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
congress
would
be
required
to
offer
a
contract
that
provided
the
same
rights
to
power
that
they
had
under...
excuse
me,
bonneville
would
be
required
to
offer
a
contract
that
gave
them
the
same
rights
to
power
that
they
had
under
their
1975
contract.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
it
talks
about
an
amount
of
power
equivalent
to
that
to
which
they
were
entitled.
that
is
what
bonneville
did
not
do.
under
their
1975
contracts
they
were
not
entitled
to
this
priority
to
nonfirm.
that
is
undisputed.
we
had
that
priority
to
nonfirm.
that
is
the
change
in
question
that
the
bonneville
administrator
did
in
this
case,
and
it
is
the
essence
of
what
prompted
this
law
suit
to
come
before
the
courts.
he
changed
the
amount
of
power
that
they
would
receive.
mr.
ganzfried
was
looking
for
a
citation
for
justice
stevens.
the
petitioners'
brief
states
that
their
minimum
entitlement
under
their
old
contracts
was
approximately
85
percent,
that
their
minimum
entitlements
under
their
new
contract
will
be
96
percent.
that
is
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
power
they
are
entitled
to,
an
increase
that
congress
specifically
prohibited.
the
clear
language
of
section
5(a)
about
all
power
sales...
if
i
may
take
a
minute
i
think
it
is
instructive
to
this
court
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
origin
of
that
language.
the
original
bill
that
senator
jackson
sponsored
merely
paid
lip
service
to
preference.
my
clients
did
not
support
it
and
because
it
was
a
northwest
bill
and
it
did
not
have
regional
consensus
it
died.
then
senator
jackson
introduced
a
second
bill.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes.
i
am
sorry.
the
second
bill
which
led
to
become
the
present
act
did
not
have
section
5(a)
in
it.
senator
jackson
had
hearings.
representatives
of
my
clients
and
other
people
in
the
northwest
and
across
the
nation
said
someone
may
make
the
exact
argument
that
mr.
ganzfried
and
the
petitioners
have
made
that
preference
now
only
applies
to
surplus
or
uncommitted
power.
this
court
should
know
that
by
definition
as
described
in
the
brief,
surplus
or
uncommitted
power
is
power
that
is
not
needed
in
the
northwest.
my
clients
would
have
a
preference
to
air
that
power
is
power
that
is
beyond
the
needs
of
the
northwest.
that
was
explained
to
senator
jackson.
this
is
traced
very
well
in
the
amicus
brief
by
the
appa,
the
american
public
power
council,
at
page
24.
senator
jackson
then
in
the
next
session
because
time
ran
out
introduced
the
present
bill,
and
he
said,
i
have
listened
to
the
public
power
council.
i
was
concerned
that
there
might
be
some
inroad
on
this
priority
and
so,
therefore,
i
have
inserted
sections
5(a)
and
10(c)
to
be
sure
that
that
line
was
drawn
so
that
after
congress
had
acted
someone
could
not
subsequently
come
in
and
cross
that
line
and
take
a
piece
of
power
that
had
been
committed
to
the
priority
customers
because
prior
to
the
regional
act
we
had
both
a
statutory
mandate
to
that
priority
to
nonfirm
and
it
was
a
part
of
our
contracts.
subsequent
to
the
regional
act
they
are
given
in
their
contracts
a
priority
to
that
nonfirm
energy.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
no,
we
would
not
have
done
that
because
the
dsi's
contracts
provided
for
certain
interruption
rights
to
cover
that
process
in
case
we
grew
and
bonneville
did
not
have
the
resources.
the
present
regional
act
expressly--
mr.
james
t.
waldron
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
that
is
correct
if
there
was
an
amount
of
power
available
when
the
administrator
entered
into
that
contract
that
we
reasonably
could
not
foresee.
that
is
all
mandated
directly
in
the
bonneville
project
act.
that
is
the
section
that
immediately
follows
our
express
priority
to
all
sales.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
no,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
perhaps
i
was
not
clear.
under
our
prior
contracts
we
had
the
priority
to
nonfirm
energy.
they
did
not.
they
did
not
have
an
entitlement
to
that
amount
of
power.
that
was
ours.
so
we
would
not
have
to
interrupt
them.
under
the
present
contracts
the
bpa
administrator
has
reversed
that
priority
and
given
that
priority
to
the
aluminum
companies
and
taken
it
away
from
the
priority
and
preference
customers.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes,
sir.
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out,
what
they
did
was
they
remanded
it
to
the
bonneville
administrator
to
write
a
proper
contract,
which
would
maintain
our
priority
as
congress
expressly
stated.
i
think,
and
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
that
5(a)
and
10(c)
are
clear
and
that
they
are
introduced
by
senator
jackson
precisely
to
enter
their
arguments.
he
said
that
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
no.
that
is
something
that
was
devised
by
a
person
called
mr.
goldhammer,
a
bonneville
employee,
to
take
advantage
of
some
of
the
interruptability
of
the
aluminum
companies.
it
applies
to
four
quartiles.
the
top
quartile
is
interruptable
at
any
time.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
one-fourth
of
their
loads
is
assigned
to
be
in
the
top
quartile.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
every
day.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes,
sir.
when
we
receive
the
nonfirm
it
is
sold...
perhaps
this
might
make
it
even
more
clear.
nonfirm
is
sold
on
an
hour-by-hour
basis.
firm
power
is
sold
over
20
years
or
perhaps
through
yearly
contracts.
that
is
what
makes
it
firm.
on
the
nonfirm
each
hour
the
bpa
scheduler...
if
i
could
actually
put
you
at
bonneville...
looks
at
how
much
water
is
behind
the
dam.
he
looks
at
the
preference
customer's
need,
which
on
a
magnitude
over
a
year
are
30
to
1,000
because
we
use
it
to
keep
our
reservoirs
full
because
we
are
in
a
different
climate...
we
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
from
their
reservoirs...
or
when
we
are
maintaining
our
own
generation
or
our
generation
has
gone
down.
he
looks
at
that
small
amount
and
says,
preference
customers,
do
they
need
any
at
five
of
the
hour?
if
they
do,
then
he
goes
on
down
the
priority.
prior
to
the
present
situation
the
remainder
was
split
equally
between
the
privately-owned
utilities
and
the
aluminum
companies.
bonneville
has
leapfrogged
the
aluminum
companies
all
the
way
to
the
top
now.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
the
legislative
history
we
have
cited
at
page
29
indicates
20
people
in
congress,
every
person
that
sponsored
the
bill
from
the
northwest,
every
single
one
of
them
said
one
thing,
we
have
completely
protected
the
previous
priority
of
my
clients.
most
of
them
also
said,
and
now
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
the
nonpreference
customers
by
giving
bonneville
for
the
first
time
the
right
to
buy
power.
there
is
not
a
single
place
in
that
legislative
history
that
petitioners
or
the
government
can
point
to
where
anyone
in
congress
said,
we
are
going
to
change
this
priority
to
nonfirm
energy.
section
5(a),
for
example,
in
the
statute
does
not
say
we
have
priority
to
all
power
sales
except
this
one
exception
we
are
going
to
make
for
the
aluminum
companies.
section
10(c)
does
not
say
either.
i
think
it
is
instructive
also
if
we
could
go
back
to
this
four-year
process
where,
for
example,
the
lobbyist
for
the
aluminum
companies
when
they
testified
to
congress
their
statement
is
the
only
benefit
the
aluminum
companies
ought
to
receive
from
this
legislative
process
is
long-term
contracts.
that
was
their
benefit.
they
use
30
percent
of
the
power
in
the
northwest,
and
it
was
important
and
we
recognized--
mr.
james
t.
waldron
--they
were
expired.
the
first
one
would
have
expired
an
1981.
the
act
was
passed
december
5,
1980.
what
would
have
happened
to
them,
justice
rehnquist,
is
they
would
have
had
to
become
for
85
percent
of
them
customers
of
my
clients.
they
would
have
then
gotten
the
same
service
as
boeing
or
warehouser
or
longview
fiber,
the
large
industries
in
the
northwest,
the
other
2,000
industries.
they
wanted
this
regional
act
so
that
they
could
have
this
relationship
with
bonneville
where
they
got
this
assured
supply
because
as
they
record
is
replete
with
they
are
enormous
users
of
electricity.
we
did
not
dispute
that.
what
we
dispute
is
where
they
cross
the
line.
this
was
a
regional
consensus.
we
all
agree.
there
is
no
place
in
the
legislative
history
where
they
asked
to
cross
this
line,
and
there
is
no
place
in
the
regional
act
that
authorizes
the
crossing
of
this
line.
that
is
in
essence
the
dispute
we
had.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
that
was
as
they
described
it
a
legal
fiction
that
said
that
there
could
not
be
a
law
suit
initially
if
bonneville
had
not
been
able
to
buy
enough
resources
to
serve
them.
there
was
no
problem
with
that
because
bonneville
also
had
short-term
purchase
authority.
this
was
a
provision
that
the
aluminum
companies
authored
that
some
outsider
could
not
come
in
and
say,
bonneville,
you
cannot
enter
into
20-year
contracts
because
you
have
not
acquired
the
resources
yet.
what
are
you
selling?
they
had
short-term
authority
to
sell
them
over
the
first
few
years,
and
then
they
needed
to
acquire
the
resources.
so
it
was
a
legal
fiction
to
prevent
that
challenge.
when
we
are
talking
also
about
the
legislative
history,
and
again
i
refer
to
the
act
as
being
clear,
i
think
the
most
instructive
piece
of
legislative
history
is
when
the
bpa
administrator
testified
before
congress,
before
senator
jackson
on
the
final
hearing
of
the
bill
that
become
this
act.
we
have
quoted
it
at
length,
and
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
it,
but
the
emphasis
there
is
the
bpa
administrator
informed
congres
that
this
priority
was
expressly
to
be
protected
and
that
we
were
to
have
first
call
on
the
federal
base
system,
which
is
what
produces
the
nonfirm,
and
there
was
to
be
no
change
in
this
priority.
what
the
act
was
to
do
was
to
give
mr.
monroe,
the
administrator,
the
authority
to
buy
resources
and,
therefore,
he
could
meet
the
needs
of
the
nonpreference
customers.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
he
may
have.
he
was
replaced
shortly
thereafter,
and
when
the
election--
mr.
james
t.
waldron
--no,
his
successor
adopted
a
different
view,
and
as
we
described
in
our
brief
also
declared
that
there
was
some
negotiation
of
contracts.
he
declared
that.
that
was
nonnegotiable.
we
could
negotiate
anything
else,
but
that
change
that
he
said
that
he
had
to
do
he
said
could
not
be
discussed
in
the
contract
negotiations.
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
private
utilities'
brief.
they
have
amplified
that.
one
other
important
point,
i
think,
is
that
the
solicitor
discussed
the
reserves
provided.
the
reserves
that
are
provided
in
the
regional
act
are
a
codification
of
bpa's
administrative
practice
prior
to
the
regional
act.
that
was
told
to
congress,
and
that
is
what
congress
did.
it
codified
it.
prior
to
the
regional
act,
and
this
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
mr.
goldhammer
who
authorized
these
reserve
provisions
described
them
as
providing
reserves
to
the
administrator
for
his
firm
loads.
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
port
of
astoria
v.
hodel,
the
only
court
to
construe
these
reserves,
said
they
provide
reserves
for
the
firm
loads
of
the
administrator.
then
the
role
fis,
which
bonneville
published
simultaneously
with
the
act
describing
this
alternative
as
how
it
would
sell
power,
is
almost
verbatim.
it
will
provide
reserves
for
the
firm
loads
of
the
administrator.
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
the
regional
act
changed
these
reserves.
they
are
almost
word
for
word
the
administrative
practice
and
everyone
in
the
region's
understanding
including
congress.
when
they
were
translated
into
the
contracts
for
the
aluminum
companies
they
say
provide
reserves
for
the
administrator.
then
they
get
to
the
heart
of
the
issue,
and
they
say,
however,
power
will
be
sold
first
to
the
aluminum
companies
before
anyone
else.
that
is
the
change
that
they
did
not
follow
from
congress.
that
is
the
change
in
priority
that
is
embodied
in
section
8(a)
of
the
new
contract
and
is
the
heart,
again,
of
this
dispute.
i
would
also
like
to
emphasize
a
point
i
made
earlier
regarding
its
importance
to
us.
this
power...
again
the
ratio
is
perhaps
30
to
100,
but
this
nonfirm
power
we
use
first
of
all
when
our
reservoirs
are
depleted,
when
we
are
not
sure
we
can
serve
our
firm
loads
because
it
has
not
rained
on
our
side
of
the
mountains;
secondly,
when
we
have
scheduled
maintenance;...
we
schedule
our
maintenance
of
our
plant
when
we
can
have
available
bpa
nonfirm
service.
that
will
be
dramatically
changed
under
this
situation...
thirdly,
when
we
have
a
forced
outage.
when
a
plant
goes
down
our
needs
are
small
enough
that
if
you
do
not
put
that
1,000
unit
load
ahead
of
us
we
can
almost
rely
upon
their
being
small
amounts,
even
in
a
drought
year,
of
bpa
nonfirm
that
can
protect
our
firm
load
when
we
need
it.
in
conclusion,
and
i
would
like
to
summarize
it
really
based
on
the
framework
that
this
court
has
used
in
reviewing
statutory
construction.
the
act
itself
is
clear
under
our
point
of
view.
we
have
priority
to
all
power
sales
and
nothing
shall
diminish
that
priority.
their
reading
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language.
they
say
we
have
priority
to
all
sales
except
this
nonfirm
and
that
nothing
has
been
diminished
except
this
nonfirm
in
the
northwest.
as
far
as
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
is
clear
equally.
it
says
that
priority
will
be
protected.
there
will
be
a
line
drawn
down
this
bigger
pie,
and
we
retain
our
priority
to
federal
base
system
resources,
which
produce
this
nonfirm.
the
new
resources
acquired
by
bpa
or
bought
by
bpa
will
go
to
the
nonpreference
customers.
that
is
clear.
their
argument
is
that
that
legislative
history
is
not
clear
and
that
senator
jackson
did
not
mean
what
he
said
or
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
when
he
inserted
section
5(a)
into
the
regional
act.
the
third
point
is
the
underlying
policies
of
the
act,
and
that
is
where
they
are
especially
inconsistent.
if
i
might
call
it
the
beauty
of
this
act
is
you
had
a
serious
dispute.
you
had
what
they
described
as
a
civil
war.
what
happened
is
congress
said,
okay,
we
obtained
the
consensus
of
the
priority
customers
by
protecting
their
priority,
but
bpa
has
not
been
able
to
acquire
any
new
power
for
a
long
time
because
no
dams
have
been
built
so
we
will
give
them
this
new
authority
to
buy
power;
and,
therefore,
bpa
can
go
out
and
acquire
resources
and
be
sure
that
the
aluminum
companies
may
receive
their
20-year
long-term
supply
and
be
sure
that
there
can
be
some
rate
relief
for
the
privately
owned
utilities
in
the
region.
that
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
harmonizes
the
act
well.
i
think
to
me
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
change
of
this
magnitude
was
not
asked
for
before
congress
by
the
aluminum
companies.
congress
in
no
place
ever
discussed
it,
described
it.
it
is
not
mentioned
any
place
in
the
legislative
history
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
in
priority.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
yes.
the
reason
i
do,
justice
rehnquist,
is
if
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
it
begins
by
saying
the
priority
is
clear.
congress
in
5(a)
and
10(c)
has
kept
that
priority,
and
that
is
as
far
as
we
need
to
go.
then
it
followed
many
of
your
and
justice
white's
opinions
and
said,
however,
to
be
sure
we
will
give
deference
to
bpa,
and
the
act
examined
it
from
a
technical
point
of
view
and
concluded
that
it
was
undisputed
that
we
first
received
that
priority
and
they
had
no
priority
under
their
1975
contracts.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
i
am
not
obviously
going
to
comment
on
how
they
write
an
opinion,
but,
yes,
it
should
have
been
in
a
footnote
because
the
opinion
says
that
the
priority
is
clear
and
that,
therefore,
we
do
not
have
to
go
beyond
the
priority
to
the
equivalent
amount
of
power.
then
when
they
raised
it...
the
first
time
they
ever
emphasized
it
was
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
rehearing
en
banc...
when
they
raised
that
at
that
time
then
the
ninth
circuit
added
that
footnote
which
basically
summarizes
it
and
says
they
are
tied
to
their
entitlement
under
their
1975
contracts,
and
under
those
contracts
they
had
no
entitlement
to
this
nonfirm
energy.
mr.
james
t.
waldron
was
not
emphasized
just
as,
i
might
add,
if
we
are
looking
at
consistency
of
administrative
construction,
for
example,
the
surplus
argument,
the
argument
that
we
only
have
a
right
to
the
surplus
and
that
5(a)
is
basically
written
out
of
the
act
as
they
would
like,
that
was
mentioned
for
the
first
time
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
really
briefed
for
the
first
time
before
this
court.
it
was
not
in
the
administrator's
record
of
decision.
it
is
not
what
he
relied
upon.
thank
you.
