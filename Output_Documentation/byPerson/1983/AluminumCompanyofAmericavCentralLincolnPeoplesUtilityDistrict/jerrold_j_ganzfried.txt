mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
argument
boils
down
to
two
points
i
would
like
to
stress
this
morning:
first,
that
the
bonneville
administrator's
decision
fully
accords
with
expressed
statutory
directive
and
with
congressional
intent,
and
that
alone
should
suffice
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
our
second
point
is
that
even
if
other
interpretations
of
the
act
are
possible
that
the
administrator's
decision
is
a
reasonable
one
and
is,
therefore,
entitled
to
substantial
deference.
i
am
not
going
to
spend
much
time
putting
the
regional
act
in
perspective.
i
think
mr.
popofsky
has
done
that.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
only
that
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
under
consideration
the
region
faced
three
pressing
concerns:
an
impending
power
shortage,
uncertainty
in
planning
for
the
future,
and
a
great
disparity
in
rates
paid
by
consumers.
what
was
needed
and
what
was
recognized
as
the
solution
to
this
was
a
legislative
plan
of
allocation,
and
for
this
the
region
turned
to
congress.
the
act
that
congress
passed
was
a
careful
balance
of
interdependent
factors.
in
the
end
the
competing
interests
that
addressed
congress
arrived
at
a
compromise,
and
in
this
compromise
all
customers
derived
benefits
and
all
were
required
to
make
concessions
in
order
that
the
common
good
in
planning
for
power
could
be
served.
now
in
this
proceeding
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
upset
that
balance,
and
they
are
trying
to
do
that
by
preserving
the
enormous
benefits
they
got
in
the
regional
act
while
rejecting
the
trade-offs
that
they
had
to
make.
obviously
the
statute
and
its
subject
matter
are
highly
technical
and
complex,
but
the
legal
issues
in
the
case
are
straightforward
and
relatively
simple.
in
our
view
they
are
easily
believed
under
well
established
rules
of
statutory
construction
and
administrative
law.
the
key
to
the
case
is
the
expressed
directive
of
section
(5)(d)(1)(b)
in
the
regional
act
that
bonneville
shall
offer
to
each
existing
dsi
an
initial
long-term
contract
that
provides
for
an
amount
of
power
equivalent
to
that
which
such
customers
are
entitled
under
its
1975
contract.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
surely.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
would
be
entitled
to
the
same
amount
of
power?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
they
have
an
additional
protection
as
to
the
first
quartile.
they
have
less
protection
as
to
the
second
quartile,
and
what
i
would
have
to
do,
and
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
do
that,
is
to
predict
which
set
of
circumstances,
namely,
those
that
trigger
first
quartile
interruptions
or
those
that
trigger
second
quartile
interruptions
would
be
the
more
likely
to
occur.
in
congress'
view
it
was
likely
that
the
amount
of
power
actually
received,
the
energy
received
by
the
dsi's,
would
go
up,
and
i
believe
that
the
dsi's
reply
brief
addresses
that
in
reference
to
the
comments
in
the
senate
committee
report
indicating
congress'
expectation
that
the
energy
received
would
go
up
to
between
85
and
96
percent
of
the
total
contract
load,
which
was
somewhat
more
than
they
had
actually
received
under
the
1975
contracts.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
congress
thought
it
would
be
higher.
now,
that
was
their
determination--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
not
necessarily
because
what
would
happen
under
the
respondents'
view
of
the
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
total
entitlement
to
power
would
be...
i
might
add
under
what
i
understand
is
the
ninth
circuit's
view
of
the
case...
the
total
entitlement
to
power
for
the
dsi's
is
not
the
full
contract
load,
not
what
is
specified
in
the
'75
contracts
as
the
amount
of
power,
but
rather
three-quarters
of
that
because
as
the
ninth
circuit
believed
it
was
only
three-quarters
of
that
that
had
been
allocated.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
but
that
is
not
the
way
the
'75
contracts
work.
the
'75
contracts
indicated
in
section
4...
that
is
at
page
n-2
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
that
the
amount
of
power
that
is
sold
is
the
full
amount,
the
full
contract
load.
those
were
the
figures
that
were
before
congress
when
it
was
considering
the
regional
act.
now
i
might
also
add
that
the
questions
as
to
interruption
do
not
appear
in
section
4
of
the
1975
contracts,
but
rather
they
are
elsewhere.
the
amount
of
power
is
clearly
the
full
amount
and
was
clearly
understood
by
everyone
to
be
the
full
contract
load.
on
this
question
of
the
amount
of
power,
in
our
view
what
we
were
required
to
do
was
to
offer
a
contract
that
provided
an
amount
of
power
equivalent
to
the
amount
they
were
entitled
to
in
1975,
and
as
you
can
see
from
the
chart
on
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix
we
have
done
precisely
that.
we
offered
new
contracts
for
the
same
amount
of
power
that
the
dsi's
were
entitled
to
before,
and
in
our
view
there
is
really
nothing
else
that
need
be
addressed
in
this
case.
since
the
1981
contracts
entitle
the
dsi's
to
no
greater
amount
of
power
bonneville
clearly
followed
an
express
and
specific
statutory
command.
unfortunately
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
initial
opinion
did
not
even
address
this
issue,
amount
of
power.
in
footnote
9
of
its
original
opinion,
which
is
at
page
65
of
the
joint
appendix,
it
specifically
declined
to
decide
whether
the
new
contracts
involved
a
greater
amount
of
power
than
the
old
ones.
it
was
wrong
for
the
court
to
do
that.
the
issue
had
to
be
addressed,
and
eventually
when
the
court
did
address
it
in
its
amended
opinion
it
added
footnote
4
that
says,
in
effect,
the
'75
contracts
never
entitled
the
dsi's
to
the
top
quartile
and,
therefore,
the
new
contracts
can
do
no
more.
the
point
is
that
that
is
wrong.
as
i
indicated,
section
4
of
the
'75
contracts
specified
an
amount
of
power,
and
it
was
the
full
amount.
now
because
the
top
quartile
was
subject
to
interruption
which
is
something
that
happens
under
a
different
section
of
those
contracts,
the
court
concluded
that
the
dsi's
are
now
entitled
to...
are
limited
to
the
same
terms
of
service
as
they
were
before.
what
it
did
was
it
confused
the
notion
of
amount
of
power
and
terms
of
service,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
why
that
is
wrong.
first
of
all,
the
regional
act
is
to
the
contrary,
and
the
house
commerce
report
makes
clear
at
page
d-123
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
that
section
5(d)(1)
refers
to
the
amount
of
power
to
which
the
dsi's
were
entitled
and
not
to
the
amount
that
happened
to
be
used
at
a
particular
time.
in
addition,
there
were
tables
that
were
listing
what
the
dsi
entitlement
was
and
what
congress
understood
it
to
be,
and
those
figures
in
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
are
references
to
the
full
contract
load
under
the
1975
contracts.
what
the
ninth
circuit
also
ignored
was
the
clear
congressional
directive
that
bonneville
take
new
steps
to
improve
the
quality
of
service
to
the
top
quartile
and
to
serve
that
quartile
as
if
it
were
firm.
now
that
language
f-74
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
while
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged
that
this
was
the
congressional
plan
and
said
so
in
footnote
7
of
its
opinion
it
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
the
plan.
instead
it
dismissed
the
committee
reports
as
ambiguous
and
meaningless,
but
the
court
of
appeals
really
made
no
effort
to
understand
what
those
reports
were
about,
and
in
particular
the
court
made
no
reference
to
section
5(f)
of
the
act,
another
provision
dealing
with
the
question
of
when
the
preference
customers
are
entitled
to
assert
that
preference.
now
even
if
the
question
of
the
quality
of
service
is
reached
it
is
our
position
that
the
respondents
are
wrong.
unlike
the
situation
that
existed
before
when
the
dsi's
top
quartile
could
be
interrupted
for
any
reason,
the
regional
act
specifies
that
the
dsi
load
shall
provide
a
portion
of
the
administrator's
reserves.
that
is,
it
may
be
interrupted
only
for
firm
power
loads
within
the
region.
that
is
in
section
5(d)(1)(a)
of
the
act,
and
it
is
language
that
is
consistent
with
section
5(b)(1)
of
the
act.
now
the
import
of
that
language
is
made
crystal
clear
in
the
senate
report.
that
is
at
page
f-47
and
f-48
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
that
report
states
that
it
is
not
intended
that
the
administrator's
reserves
will
be
used
to
protect
other
than
firm
loads.
so
it
was
congress
that
changed
the
status
of
the
dsi
reserve
and
the
terms
of
interruption.
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
act
of
the
administrator.
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
it,
congress
was
absolutely
well
aware
of
what
it
was
doing.
while
this
complex
legislation
was
pending,
representative
kazen
the
chairman
of
the
house
interior
subcommittee
on
water
and
power
inquired
of
bonneville
just
how
the
dsi
load
would
be
served.
the
administrator
responded
and
told
representative
kazen
that
he
would
do
precisely
what
he
eventually
did,
namely,
that
25
percent
would
be
subject
to
restriction
to
serve
firm
loads
of
other
customers.
this
statement
was
adopted
verbatim
in
the
house
report
and
approved
by
the
senate.
the
act
was
passed
with
this
understanding.
bonneville
went
out
and
dit
it--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
our
first
point
is
that
this
is
the
only
way
the
statute
could
be
construed.
we
had
to
offer
contracts
to
the
dsi's.
it
had
to
be
for
the
amount
of
power
equivalent
to
what
they
got
before,
and
it
had
to
provide--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--if
it
had
offered
less
than
the
amount
of
power
entitlement
of
the
1975
contract
it
probably
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
would
have,
but
we
did
not--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--our
first
argument
is
that
there
was
only
one
way
it
could
be
done,
and
it
was
done
that
way
and
it
was
the
way
that
congress
was
told
it
would
be
done.
if
i
am
wrong
about
that
and
there
is
another
intrepretation
and
bonneville
was
not
required
to
do
what
it
did,
it
was
certainly
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
for
the
administrator
to
do
what
he
did.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
ninth
circuit
was
of
the
view
presumably
that
it
had
to
be
read
another
way.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
preferred
to
read
it
the
other
way
even
though
as
it
said
that
bonneville's
interpretation
was
supported
by
the
legislative
history.
it
also
said
that
bonneville's
policy
may
serve
the
purpose
of
the
preference
clause.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
what
it
did
was
it
focused
on
the
preference
clause.
its
original
opinion
spoke
only
of
the
preference
clause
and
did
not
address
the
amount
of
power
issue.
there
was
really
no
way
for
this
case
to
be
decided
without
the
amount
of
power
issue
being
decided
for
reasons
i
think
you
suggest
in
your
question.
if
we
did
what
we
were
expressly
told
to
do,
we
complied
with
the
statute
and
other
provisions
would
have
to
be
put
into
harmony
with
the
specific
directive
we
followed.
if
we
violated
the
specific
directive
of
5(d)(1)(b)
then
the
provisions
of
this
contract
would
be
invalid,
not
because
of
a
preference
claim
but
because
we
violated
the
specific
provision
telling
us
what
we
were
to
offer
to
the
dsi's.
i
would
just
like
to
add
one
other
comment
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
had
to
say
that
supports
our
view
in
the
case
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
to
say
at
page
13
of
its
opinion
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
under
bonneville's
construction
all
of
its
customers
would
benefit.
that
was
the
point
that
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
when
it
passed
the
regional
act.
it
was
trying
to
benefit
all
of
the
customers.
for
the
reasons
outlined
in
the
briefs,
because
of
the
interdependency
and
the
need
to
sell
to
the
dsi's
the
benefits
of
that
reserve
in
subsidizing
the
exchange
program,
the
lower
rates
for
the
customers
of
privately
owned
utilities,
all
of
this
pattern
that
mixes
together,
if
we
start
tugging
at
one
point
of
this
ball
of
yarn
it
is
going
to
begin
to
unravel.
congress
put
this
together
very
carefully.
we
think
it
should
remain
in
place
as
the
administrator
concluded.
thank
you.
