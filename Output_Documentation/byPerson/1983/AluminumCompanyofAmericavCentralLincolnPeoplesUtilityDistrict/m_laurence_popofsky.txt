mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
because
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
fundamentally
misconceived
the
background,
history
and
purposes
of
the
statute
enacted
in
1980,
and
as
a
consequence
also
misconceived
the
congressional
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
northwest
region.
i
would
like
to
dwell
just
a
brief
moment
on
the
history
because
i
think
it
is
instructive
of
how
the
preference
problem
fits
into
the
congressional
solution.
under
the
bonneville
project
act
of
1937
bonneville
was
authorized
to
serve
all
classes
of
customers
with
power.
those
classes
of
customers
included
not
only
those
who
were
accorded
statutory
preference
and
priority
but
also
utilities,
which
were
privately
owned
and
which
had
no
such
a
priority,
federal
agencies
and
my
clients,
the
dsi's,
the
direct
service
industries,
which
are
principally
aluminum
companies
operating
in
the
northwest.
now
the
service
to
the
aluminum
companies,
to
the
dsi's
has
certain
characteristics
which
are
important
as
we
move
into
the
congressional
considerations
in
1980.
among
those
considerations
are
that
the
load
is
interruptable.
unlike
most
industries
or
indeed
most
utilities
it
is
possible
without
absolute
and
complete
harm
to
operations
to
stop
electricity,
at
least
for
short
times,
on
an
immediate
basis
in
order
to
protect
service
to
other
customers.
at
the
same
time
because
of
the
character
of
the
dsi
load
it
is
also
possible
to
serve
that
load
with
what
is
called
nonfirm
energy,
essentially
energy,
the
production
of
which
cannot
be
guaranteed
based
on
historic
water
conditions.
as
a
consequence,
over
the
years
the
dsi
load
was
conceived
by
bonneville
has
having
unique
values
to
the
northwest
in
the
form
of
providing
reserves
to
protect
firm
power
loads
by
others.
there
was
only
one
problem
with
the
system
as
it
existed
in
the
thirties,
forties
and
fifties,
and
that
is
that
water
was
finite.
dams
were
built
on
all
acceptable
locations,
environmentally
acceptable
locations,
and
by
the
early
1970's
all
the
best
estimates
were
that
the
finite
amount
of
power
being
generated
by
bonneville
would
run
out.
that
is
where
the
preference
clause
of
the
1937
statute
was
triggered.
first,
went
the
private
utilities.
their
contracts
expired
in
1973.
all
service
to
them
was
terminated
by
bonneville
except
for
spot
purchases
thereafter.
in
1975
and
1976
the
dsi's
were
advised
that
their
contracts
which
had
been
in
existence
since
the
early
sixties
would
when
they
expired
most
likely
not
be
renewed,
again
because
of
the
existence
of
the
preference
clause.
the
consequence
was
and
the
picture
which
emerged
was
that
the
only
power
that
would
be
available
would
go
to
preference
customers,
preference
utilities
alone,
and
that
that
would
be
inadequate.
but
the
anomoly
was
that
the
bonneville
project
act
of
1937
was
intended
to
serve
consumers
and
farmers
in
the
region
and
yet
only
a
portion
of
the
region
was
served
by
the
preference
utilities.
the
fact
i
believe
you
will
see
in
the
record
that
oregon
was
generally
not
served
by
preference
utilities
whereas
washington
was
largely
served
by
preference
utilities
and
the
disparity
in
rates
that
emerged
in
the
seventies
caused,
needless
to
say,
a
considerable
political
problem
in
the
northwest.
what
happened
in
sum
was
that
preference
emerged
as
the
problem,
not
an
adequate
solution
to
the
problems
of
the
northwest.
the
only
solution
that
was
possible
was
congressional,
and
that
is
why
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1980.
now
the
statute
ended
what
was
called
a
regional
civil
war,
and
it
ended
it
in
a
manner
which
we
think
is
straightforward.
it
decreed
as
its
first
element
of
legislation
that
the
power
which
was
to
be
available
would
be
legislatively
allocated,
not
allocated
administratively.
priority
and
preference,
the
old
preference
clause
after
all,
was
a
congressional
direction
to
the
administrator
giving
him
instructions
as
to
how
he,
the
administrator,
should
allocate
power.
that
is
what
the
preference
clause
does.
it
governs
administrative
allocations.
the
heart
of
a
statute
in
1980
was
to
take
the
allocation
function
away
from
the
administrator
and
legislate
it
directly
by
statute.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
we
do
not
find
it
in
any
one
section
of
the
85
pages
of
legislation,
but
i
believe
you
will
find
it
mostly
in
section
5
where
the
sales
to
classes
of
customers
are
mandated,
and
that
is
the
key,
justice
rehnquist.
you
will
see
in
section
5
that
the
administrator
is
mandated
directly
by
congress
to
enter
into
contracts,
the
terms
of
which
are
specified.
now
historically
the
preference
clause
has
always
honored
the
existence
of
contracts.
contracts
could
be
performed
in
accordance
with
their
terms
without
an
invasion
by
a
preference
customer
so
long
as
they
had
been
validly
entered
into
in
the
first
instance.
what
congress
was
doing
in
mandating
contracts
for
all
four
classes
of
customers,
for
the
preference
customers,
the
privates,
for
the
federals
and
directly
for
the
dsi's,
what
congress
was
doing
was
saying,
we
mandate
directly
by
statute
this
amount
of
power...
we
will
come
to
that,
of
course...
this
amount
of
power
for
these
classes
of
customers.
now
we
know
that
we
are
mandating
more
power
than
bonneville
has.
we
know
that.
the
answer
to
that
is
we
will
also
authorize
bonneville
for
the
first
time
to
acquire
the
resources
necessary
to
serve
these
contracts,
and
then
we
will
do
one
more
remarkable
thing
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
no
dispute.
in
5(g)(7)
we
will
create
a
fiction.
we
will
write
a
fiction
right
into
the
statute
which
says
the
administrator
shall
be
deemed
to
have
sufficient
power
to
enter
into
these
contracts.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
if
you
look
further
into
section
5
in
the
(b)
sections,
your
honor,
you
will
find
the
terms
of
contracts
that
are
mandated.
for
example,
5(g)(1)--
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
--i
am
working
in
the
statute,
your
honor,
(b)(38)(5)(g)(1).
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
i
was
also
referring
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
but
in
(5)(g)(1)
there
is
a
mandate
that
the
administrator
shall
commence
negotiations.
in
(5)(d)(1)(b),
the
crucial
provision,
after
the
effective
date
of
this
act,
the
administrator
shall
offer...
it
is
mandatory
language...
in
accordance
with
subsection
(g)
of
this
section
to
each
existing
dsi
contract,
etcetera.
indeed
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
hearings,
the
committee
reports
they
are
described
throughout
as
required,
mandated
contracts.
i
believe
it
is
because
of
the
character
that
they
are
mandated
directly
by
congress
that
section
(5)(a)
of
the
statute
can
be
read
to
subsist
with
them
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
(5)(a)
applies
to
all
power,
all
power
which
is
not
subject
to
a
valid
and
lawful
contract,
and
a
valid,
lawful
initial
contract
are
those
specified
as
mandated
by
the
statute.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
i
agree,
your
honor.
it
absolutely
says
that,
and
the
only
question,
therefore,
before
the
court
is
how
does
one
reconcile
a
mandate
by
congress,
a
congressional
allocation,
if
you
will,
of
power
with
the
flat
statement
in
(5)(a)
that
all
sales
are
subject
to
preference.
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
plain.
preference
has
never,
has
never
required
the
invasion
or
invalidation
of
a
lawful,
valid
contract.
for
example,
in
the
1970's
the
clients
that
i
represent,
the
dsi's,
had
lawful
contracts
which
were
going
to
expire
in
1981
to
1991.
there
was
not
adequate
power
by
1976,
and
yet
nobody
suggested
that
because
if
there
was
now
an
insufficiency
of
power
that
those
contracts
were
in
any
way
invadable.
they
were
valid
according
to
their
terms
notwithstanding
the
coexistence
of
a
preference
right.
preference
attaches
only
at
the
time
of
the
offer
of
a
new
contract
to
competing
applicants,
and
here
congress
preempted
the
process.
they
said,
we
will
take
the
applications
ourselves.
through
the
legislative
process
all
four
classes
will
be
served.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
yes.
under
the
preference
clauses
of
various
statutes
as
they
have
been
interpreted
throughout
the
federal
courts,
preference
attaches
as
a
directive
to
the
administrator
under
a
statute
who
is
marketing
federal
power.
it
attaches
at
the
time
when
the
administrator
has
power
for
sale
and
announces
that
and
there
are
competing
applicants.
if
among
the
competing
applicants,
for
example,
a
preference
utility
on
the
one
hand
and
a
dsi
on
the
other,
both
applied
and
there
was
not
enough
power
to
serve
both,
at
that
point
preference
would
govern
and
direct
the
administrator
to
serve
the
preference
agency.
if
there
was
sufficient
power
for
both,
on
the
other
hand,
he
would
serve
both.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he
had
actually
entered
into
that
contract,
goes
ahead
and
enters
into
that
contract,
and
five
years
later
on...
assume
it
is
a
20
year
contract...
five
years
later
on
a
preference
utility
comes
along
and
says,
hey,
i
would
like
some
of
that
power,
and
i
have
a
statutory
preference,
no
court
has
ever
held
he
has
a
right
to
invade
an
existing
contract,
lawful
under
the
preference
clause
when
entered
into.
it
is
for
that
very
reason
you
will
find
in
the
statute
a
requirement
that
in
the
contracts
for
the
private
utilities
there
is
a
five-year
pull
back
clause
to
protect
the
preference
notion
that
after
five
years
if
power
has
become
insufficient
for
any
reason
those
contracts
can
be
interrupted
by
direction
of
congress.
that
is
the
historic
functioning
of
the
preference
clause
and
why
section
(5)(a)
can
coexist
in
a
cohesive
and
integrated
legislative
scheme
with
the
mandated
contracts
of
our
clients.
mr.
m.
laurence
popofsky
let
me
start
with
the
observation
that
the
statute
nowhere
uses
the
concept
of
firm
power
and
nowhere
uses
the
concept
nonfirm
power.
the
assumption
that
somehow
everything
congress
was
doing
took
those
separate
concepts
into
mind
as
a
statutory
matter,
preference
for
one
but
not
for
the
other,
is,
i
think,
a
figment
of
the
other
side's
imagination.
what
congress
mandated
was
contracts
for
an
amount
of
power,
5(b)(1)(b),
for
our
clients,
that
is,
a
concept
of
load
capacity,
not
load
usage,
but
load
capacity,
and
it
was
the
same
amount
of
load
capacity
as
existed
in
the
then
extent
dsi
contracts.
now,
congress
intended
as
bpa
told
them
it
would
that
it
would
use
nonfirm
power
in
the
load
subject
to
interruption
or
protection
of
firm
resources
only
in
load
in
order
to
serve
the
purposes
congress
intended
by
guaranteeing
this
mandated
contract.
those
purposes
were,
one,
to
provide
rate
relief
principally
for
people
in
oregon
who
were
being
served
by
the
private
utilities
rate
relief
which
the
dsi's
would
have
to
pay
for,
and
that
is
why
that
power
getting
to
the
dsi's
was
important,
and
also
provide
through
the
raising
of
rates
from
wholesale
to
retail
essentially
more
profit
downstream
for
bonneville.
now
this
was
all
integrated
into
the
comprehensive
legislative
scheme.
congress
intended
specifically
that
a
higher
level
of
actual
service
be
received
by
the
dsi's
through
the
combination
of
(1)
a
direction
to
bonneville
of
a
demand
capacity;
and
(2)
a
limitation
in
5(d)(1)(a)
on
the
circumstances
under
which
that
power
could
be
interrupted.
you
can
find
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history,
if
i
may
return
the
compliment,
any
discussion,
any
discussion
whatsoever
that
by
reaffirmation
of
preference
somehow
nonfirm
power
has
been
kept
outside
of
the
dsi
load
where
bonneville
wanted
to
put
it
in
order
to
obtain
the
operational
efficiencies
and
the
monetary
goals
of
the
statute.
you
cannot
find
that
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
all
you
can
find
is
a
treaty
in
which
all
customers
are
going
to
be
served
by
mandate
of
congress
free
and
clear,
at
least
for
the
original
mandated
contracts,
of
the
old
preference
problems
and
a
reaffirmation
of
preference
for
the
future,
preference
in
its
traditional
meaning,
preference
which
honors
lawful
contracts,
but
preference
which
governs
everything
including
my
client's
rights
to
any
future
contracts.
that
makes
sense
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
precisely
what
bonneville
did
in
the
contracts
under
challenge.
thank
you.
