unknown
speaker
you
limit
your
argument
to
public
defenders,
not
to
privately-retained
defenders.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
of
the
private
lawyer
who
is
just
appointed
to
represent
an
accused
or
a
particular
case?
he's
in
between
the
privately-retained
counsel
and
public
defender.
unknown
speaker
but,
nevertheless
do
not
some
of
the
suggestions
you
made
in
your
initial
summation
apply
as
much
to
the
appointed
counsel
as
they
do
to
the
public
defender?
unknown
speaker
on
the
one
point
you
made,
i'm
not
sure
it's
consistent
with
history.
the
public
defender
is
not
drafted
for
the
assignment.
he
volunteers,
or
she
volunteers
to
become
a
member
of
the
staff
of
a
public
defender;
whereas,
certainly,
the
tradition
was
that
when
a
court
called
a
private
practitioner
and
asked
that
private
practitioner
to
appear
and
defend
a
person
charged,
certainly
the
tradition
was
that
the
lawyer
should
not
refuse
but
should
accept.
unknown
speaker
what
about
private
legal
aid
societies?
unknown
speaker
your
point.
like,
for
example,
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about...
i'm
saying
what
about
states
other
than
oregon
that
have
private
public
assistance
programs
for
lawyers
defending
indigent
clients?
would
they
be
immune?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
makes
you
think
they
can
control
their
intake?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
can,
but
they
take
99
percent
of
the
cases,
would
they
be
immune?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
then
i
get
back
to
the
chief
justice.
what
about
a
private
lawyer
who
gets
a
$50,000
fee?
is
he
immune?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
collects
a
$50,000
fee,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
account
for
what
he
does?
well,
mr.
frohnmayer:
it
might
help
an
awful
lot
if
you
got
to
your
very
last
point
now.
you
weren't
arguing
that
they're
immune
from
malpractice
suits,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
1983
action.
are
your
remarks
limited
to
1983
suits,
or
are
you
saying
that
these
people
are
immune
from
malpractice
suits?
unknown
speaker
criminal?
what
about
just
a...
how
about
just
a
malpractice
suit?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
would...
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
private
lawyer
who
earned
the
fee
that
justice
marshall
mentioned
is
immune
from
a
malpractice
suit,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
he
different
from
the
legal
aid
society
or
from
the
public
defender?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
haven't
held
that
the
appointed
counsel
is
not
immune
from
malpractice
suits?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wasn't
asking
that.
i'm
asking
whether,
in
your
view,
the
legal
aid
clinic
or
the
public
defender
is
immune
from
a
state
law
malpractice
suit,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
great
state
of
oregon?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
public
defender
is
wielding
state
authority
in
the
state
of
oregon?
unknown
speaker
right.
what
if
he
isn't?
what
if
he
is
not?
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
any
basis
for
immunity
then,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frohnmayer,
none
of
our
immunity
cases,
whether
judicial
immunity,
prosecutorial
immunity,
suggest
that
there
is
immunity
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
from
state
actions,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
whichever.
unknown
speaker
so,
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
here
would
be
liable
under
an
oregon
malpractice
statute,
is
something
we
certainly
don't
have
to
decide.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
kind
of
weaving
together
kind
of
malpractice
arguments,
together
with
1983
arguments.
unknown
speaker
i
attempted
to
get
him
to
weave
them
together,
but
he
refused.
general
frohnmayer,
isn't
the
fact
that
there
are
so
few
malpractice
actions
against
public
defenders
an
argument
against
your
position
that
finding
1983
liability
would
open
floodgates
of
suits?
unknown
speaker
may
i
get
back
to
the...
we're
talking
about
a
different
guy.
what
about
a
private
lawyer
who
volunteers
his
services
for
free?
would
he
be
subject
to
a
suit,
or
would
he
have
immunity?
unknown
speaker
would
have
immunity?
unknown
speaker
why?
how
in
the
world
does
he
get
immunity?
unknown
speaker
what
has
the
government
done
to
bring
this
about?
except
to
let
him
be
born.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
state
action?
unknown
speaker
the
man
volunteered
to
defend
him,
and
they
came
to
complete
agreement
as
to
that.
and
he
spent
his
money
out
of
his
own
pocket.
but
still,
he's
subject
to
liability,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
get
1983
on
him.
unknown
speaker
is
operating
pursuant
to
an
oregon
statute.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
statute
is
my
man
operating
under?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
state
court
judge
do
in
my
case?
unknown
speaker
where
the
man
volunteered
his
services,
what
did
the
state
court
judge
do
to
bring
that
about?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
need
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
couldn't
he
bring
a
malpractice
suit?
unknown
speaker
will
he
have
immunity?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yours
is
limited
to
1983
actions.
unknown
speaker
and
you
get
immunity
on
a
1983
action,
but
under
no
other
action?
unknown
speaker
what
statute
or
constitutional
vision
says
that?
unknown
speaker
what
constitutional
or
statutory
provision
says
that
you
are
immune
under
1983,
but
under
nothing
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
give
me
the
case
that
says
that.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
general
frohnmayer,
i
take
it,
then,
that
you
are
perfectly
willing
to
accept
the
dennis
view
that
the
conspiracy
allegation
clothes
everybody
with
the
undercolor
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't...
you
don't
disagree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
conspiracy
allegation
here?
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
we
accept
that
allegation
as
the
premise
for
your
argument,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
general,
at
the
time
the
district
court
acted
in
this
case,
had
polk
county
come
down?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
had
not.
it
had,
of
course,
when
the
court
of
appeals
acted.
but
i
wonder
whether
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
dismissed
the
complaint
in
view
of
the
vague
allegations
of
conspiracy
if
polk
county
had
come
down,
no
state
action
on
the
part
of
the
defender?
unknown
speaker
they
did
allege
that
judge
woodrich
and
the
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
joined
in
the
conspiracy.
i
suppose,
as
long
as
dennis
v.
sparks
is
on
the
books,
that's
sufficient
to
bring
in
the
state
action.
unknown
speaker
suppose,
mr.
attorney
general,
though,
that
this
public
defender
under
oregon
law
was
subject
to
suit
for
conspiring
with
the
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
let's
just
assume
that
he
could
be
sued
under
oregon
law,
and
oregon
states
for
having
conspired
with
the
public
officials
in
derogation
of
his
duty.
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
is
subject
to
that
kind
of
a
suit.
wouldn't
that
have
the
same
impact
on
the
judicial
system?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
talking
about
the
public
defender,
if
he
subject
to
suit
for
conspiring
with
the
prosecution
in
derogation
of
his
duty,
the
public
defender's
duty,
under
oregon
law.
now,
isn't
he
then...
he
is
subject
to
a
serious
risk,
then,
of
being
sued
in
the
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
makes
you
think
that...
what
makes
you
think
that
there
wouldn't
be
frivolous
litigation
in
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
that's
just
the
allegation.
the
allegation
is
that
there
has
been
a
conspiracy
in
derogation
of...
i
suppose
if
there's
a
conspiracy,
it's
in
derogation
of
the
prosecutor's
duty,
as
well
as
the
public
defender's.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
rationale
for
the
exemption
the
prosecutor,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
he
file
a
malpractice
case
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
he
file
a
malpractice
lawsuit
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
said
he
couldn't
do
anything
in
the
state
court.
so
he
could
flood
the
state
court
with
malpractice
suits,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
in
the
federal
court
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
think
that
cuts
down
on
your
flood
argument?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
malpractice
insurance
in
washington?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
oregon.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
they...
they
could
get
insurance
if
they
wanted
to,
if
they
wanted
to
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
jury?
did
they
join
the
jury
here?
unknown
speaker
when
this
court
decided
the
agersinger
case
and
the
earlier
case,
certainly
there
was
some
thought
that
there
was
a
public
concern
about
having
a
person
who
was
charged
with
crime
by
the
government
be
provided
with
counsel.
unknown
speaker
you
say
no
other
duty?
unknown
speaker
what
about
his
duties
as
an
officer
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
you
suggest
he
could
advance
perjured
testimony?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
practical
observation
that
i
think
the
court
is
bound
to
have
in
mind
when
it
considers
claims
like
this.
and
we
see
thousands
of
petitions
for
certiorari
year-in,
year-out,
in
which
some
disgruntled
citizen
complains
that
the
judges
and
all
the
lawyers
and
all
the
administrators
who've
ever
been
involved
in
his
case
or
her
case
have
all
joined
in
a
massive
conspiracy
against
him.
here,
the
charge
is
that
the
circuit
judge
and
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
lawyer
and
judges
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
one
of
whom
was
a
former
attorney
general...
now,
we
all
know
that
you
have
to
believe
what's
taken
on
the
pleadings
at
the
dismissal
stage
and
so
forth,
but
we're
also
concerned,
i
think,
with,
you
know,
how
much
resources
ought
to
be
allocated
to
defend
against
this
sort
of
thing
to
bring
it
to
trial.
and,
you
know,
my
idea,
frankly,
is
that
the
chances
of
your
ever
proving
what
you
allege
are
about
one
in
a
thousand.
now,
i
realize
that
doesn't
affect
it
legally,
but
i
think
that's
bound
to
be
in
people's
minds
as
they
decide
whether
there
is
immunity
or
not.
unknown
speaker
fiat
justitia
ruat
coelum.
let
there
be
justice,
though
the
heavens
fall.
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
a
bad
position.
that's
engraved
in
stone
in
the
civil
court's
building
in
st.
louis,
missouri.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
a
malpractice
suit
in
state
courts
against
the,
i
guess,
the
public
defender?
unknown
speaker
would
it
differ
substantially
from
what
you're
suing
for
in
the
federal
court,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
you...
but
you
can't
get
to...
the
only
person
you
can
get
to
in
the
federal
court
is
the
public
defender.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
to
prove
a
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
which
is
in
agreement
with
the
judge.
why
isn't
your...
why
isn't
your
remedy,
your
malpractice
remedy,
a
much
more
useful
remedy
to
bring
justice
to
bear
on
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
it
so...
it
isn't
hard
to
retain
an
attorney
for
a
1983
suit
because
in
1988?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
he...
why
doesn't
he
just
sue
for
malpractice
pro
se?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
he
have
brought
this
1983
suit
in
the
state
court
in
oregon?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
very
suit.
could
he
not
have
brought
this
very
1983
action
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
he
had
brought
this
1983
suit
in
state
court,
would
not
the
very
issue
we
are
dealing
with
today
have
been
raised?
unknown
speaker
he
was
convicted?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but,
mr.
edwards,
isn't
it
also
true
that
in
a
malpractice
case,
the
plaintiff
must
allege
that
he
was
innocent?
unknown
speaker
and
so
that's
pretty...
sometimes
a
pretty
heavy
burden.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
wrong
with
a
federal
rule
in
the
1983
area
that
said
that
in
this
kind
of
case,
you
have
to
allege
innocence?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
pretty
hard
for
him
to
prove
damages
if
he
would
have
been
convicted,
you
know,
if
he's
really
guilty
and
would
have
been
convicted
anyway.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case,
did
this
man
allege
he
was
innocent?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is
did
he
allege
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
he
was
illegally
convicted.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
he's
the...
it
would
sound
like
that
if
you
win,
if
you
prove
up
your
case,
what
you've
really
done
is
you're
really
collaterally
attacking
his
conviction.
i
would
suppose
you're
supposed
to
do
that
in
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
is
he
on
parole,
or--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
he's
still
technically
in
custody
or
not?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
1983
which,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
thought
about
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
one
word
about
polk
county.
i
talked
about
the
legislative
history
of
1983,
which
was
a
little
before
polk
county
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
unknown
speaker
how
about
briscoe
v.
the
witnesses?
would
you
say
that's
a
public--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing,
apply
that
same
analysis
to
briscoe,
i
think,
that
you're
allowing
witnesses
to
perjure
themselves.
obviously,
witness
perjury
doesn't
help
the
judicial
process
any
more
than
conspiracy
between
public
defenders
and
judges
help
the
judicial
process.
the
question
is,
you
know,
under
what
circumstances,
if
ever,
shall
people
who
participate
in
the
judicial
process
be
called
to
account
under
a
separate
1983
action
for
the
role
they
played
in
the
judicial
process.
unknown
speaker
how
often
would
you
estimate
this
sort
of
a
conspiracy
takes
place
in
oregon?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
at
this
stage
whether
any
claims
have
merit
to
them,
i
guess.
and
the
system
that
you're
advocating
requires
the
application
of
public
resources
to
even
the
most
frivolous
claims.
that's
the
whole
point
made
by
the
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
make
a
tangential
argument
for
qualified
immunity
for
public
defenders.
unknown
speaker
the
policeman
has
it,
and
the
prosecutor
has
it,
and
the
judge
has
it,
and
the
witnesses
have
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
edwards,
your
position,
then,
is
that
the
public
defender
is
not
a
public
official,
but
he
nonetheless
acts
under
color
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
dennis
holding.
unknown
speaker
why,
logically,
should
that
be?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
why,
logically,
should
someone
who
is
not
ordinarily
acting
under
color
of
state
in
law
in
performing
the
functions
allotted
to
him,
when
he
conspires
with
a
state
official,
why
should
that
person's
action
be
transformed
into--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
is
it
clear?
i
mean,
logically?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
purpose
is
an
illegal
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
state
action
is
certainly
involved
in
a
conviction,
and
that
this
person
is
accused
of
subverting
the
proper
conduct
of
public
officials.
unknown
speaker
you're
really
accusing
of
conspiracy,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
saying
you're
action
is
really...
has
to
be
a
claim
of
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
prove
an
agreement,
why
you've
subverted...
there's
a
subversion
of
the
prosecutor's
function,
too.
unknown
speaker
so
his
liability
could
be
for
doing
that,
not
acting
for
the
state,
but
acting
against
the
state
by
subverting
its
proper
conduct.
unknown
speaker
mr.
edwards,
how
is
it
that
you
distinguish
the
briscoe
v.
lahue
approach,
which
indicated
that
all
people,
governmental
or
otherwise,
who
are
integral
parts
of
the
judicial
process,
are
covered
by
immunity?
why
isn't
the
public
defender
part
of
the
judicial
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
that
briscoe
turned
on
making
witnesses
quasi-judicial.
it
simply
brought
them
in
under
the
umbrella
of
the
judicial
process.
and
the
judicial
process
in
our
country
requires
counsel
for
the
defendant
as
well
as
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
and
the
witnesses.
unknown
speaker
of
course.
but
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
production
of
truth
by
virtue
of
the
adversarial
process.
the
public
has
an
interest
in
all
aspects
of
this
judicial
proceeding,
and
maybe
that
interest
is
so
great
that
it
requires
immunity
for
all
participants.
that's
the
question,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
attorney
general?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
right
there?
it
kind
of
relates
to
the
burden
problem.
just
reflecting
on
this
case...
of
course,
this
man,
i
understand,
is
out
of
jail
now,
but
wouldn't
it
be
true
that
in
most
cases
of
this
kind,
that
the
allegations
would
be
made
by
way
of
a
habeas
corpus
petition
asking...
seeking
release
while
the
man's...
you're
going
to
have
the
burden.
if
the
man
wants
to
make
these
charges,
you're
going
to
have
to
try
him
out
once.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you've
gone
through
all
that
machiner
and,
say,
the
state
prevailed
and
said
there
was
no
merit
to
these
charges,
wouldn't
you
be
able
to
get
rid
of
it
on
a
summary
judgment,
in
most
cases?
unknown
speaker
but
i
just
think,
realistically,
most
of
these
allegations
would
produce
that
kind
of
litigation,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
but,
clearly,
if
these
facts
are
true,
the
convictions
no
good.
unknown
speaker
i
just
have
trouble...
i'm
just
trying
to
wrestle
with
the
notion
of
whether
there
really
is
a
mountain
of
litigation
of
this
kind
out
there,
or
just
a
few
isolated
cases.
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
do
you
think
the
availability
of
attorneys'
fees
to
a
successful
plaintiff
under
1983
is
an
incentive
to
use
that
as
a
cause
of
action?
