mr.
craig
k.
edwards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
glover's
allegations
in
this
matter,
if
true,
present
a
classic
situation
that
the
42nd
congress
intended
to
remedy
by
the
enactment
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
where
it's
alleged
that
state
trial
judges,
state
appellate
judges,
and
state
officials
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
constitutional
rights,
a
federal
avenue
of
redress
must
remain
open
to
ensure
the
protection
of
those
constitutional
rights
and
to
ensure
that
a
citizen
has
an
adequate
avenue
to
obtain
redress
for
that
derivation.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
members
of
the
jury
may
not
have
been
joined
under
that
legislation,
but
members
of
the
jury
would
perform
a
greater
public
interest.
we
maintain
that
a
public
defender
does
not
perform
in
the
interest
of
the
public.
the
public
defender's
duty
is
to
represent
the
clients,
the
indigent
accused's
interests,
and
to
oppose
the
government
in
adversary
litigation.
that's
the--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--your
honor,
where
counsel
is
appointed
or
is
a
public
defender
to
represent
the
accused's
best
interest,
that
counselor,
whether
retained,
appointed,
or
a
public
defender,
has
not
other
duty
but
to
represent
and
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
accused.
in
this
case--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--there
may
be--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--well,
certainly,
there
are
obligations
to
the
court
and--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--no.
in
fact,
we
don't,
your
honor,
and
that's
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
believe
goes
in
our
favor;
that
a
public
defender,
even
though
a
public
defender
may
not
be
able
to
refuse
a
case,
the
public
defender
certainly
has
an
obligation
not
to
advance
frivolous
claims,
the
floodgates
of
frivolous
claims
and
such,
that
mr.
frohnmayer
suggested
may
be
advanced.
the
public
defender
has
that
obligation
not
to
do
that.
there
is
also
the
general
public
interest
in
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
for
all
accused,
whether
they
have
money
or
whether
they
don't.
but
the
primary
emphasis
or
the
primary
reason
for
that,
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
has
always
looked
at,
is
the
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
adversarial
process
is
a
strong
one.
and
at
any
time
where
we
have
the
interests
of
the
government
which
say
that
a
public
defender
should
be
immune
because
the
government
has
to
spend
its
resources
more
economically
and
such,
we're
subverting
that
adversarial
process.
we're
not
maintaining
a
strong
separation
between
the
person
who
is
supposed
to
represent
the
accused's
best
interest.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
your
honor,
certainly
there
is
no
way
to
stop
a
frivolous
complaint
from
being
filed
under
section
1983.
and
we
don't
maintain
that
there
will
not
be
frivolous
complaints
filed.
it's
our
point
that
that
one
case
in
a
thousand
which
has
merit
to
it,
and
the
attorney
general
has
suggested
that
there
are
cases
that
do
have
some
merit
to
them,
that
one
case
in
a
thousand,
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
constitutional
rights
without
any
federal
avenue
of
redress
is
too
great,
considering
that
the
only
public
interest
is
in
the
efficient
expenditure
of
resources.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
your
honor,
the
constitutional
rights
are
precious.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
your
honor,
my
point
is
that
those
rights
are
precious,
and
that
at
any
time
that
government
acts
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
those
rights,
the
purpose
behind
the
1871
civil
rights
act
should
be
available
to
a
citizen
to
utilize
that
independent
avenue
of
redress.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
it's
my
position
that
there
certainly
could
be
a
malpractice
in
state
courts
against
the
public
defender.
where
the
only
allegations
are
that
a
public
defender
was
negligent
in
the
representation
of
a
case,
a
malpractice
case
should
vie
against
the
public
defender.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
it
certainly
would,
because
if
we
were
suing
in
the
federal
court
for
just
a
malpractice
claim,
we
couldn't
get
to
the
color
of
law
requirement
under
1983.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
is
the
public
defender,
because
the
defense
attorney
who
is--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--that's
right.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
in
many
cases,
your
honor,
where
a
malpractice
remedy
is
available,
it's
very
difficult
for
an
indigent
accused
to
be
able
to
retain
an
attorney.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
there
are
not
members
of
the
bar
who--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--no.
most
of
these
claims,
as
mr.
frohnmayer
has
suggested,
are
brought
pro
se,
where
the
indigent
accused
has
an
avenue
of
redress.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
well,
the
pleading
requirements
are
difficult
to
meet
in
the
state
court.
there
may
also
be
the
burden
that
the
defendant
has
to
show--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--not...
he
could
have
brought,
alleging
conspiracy.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
yes,
he
could
have.
but
the
court
has
made
clear,
since
monroe
v.
pape,
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
state
remedies
the
address,
or
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
state
court.
we
have
the
congress,
which
in
this
situation
where
it's
alleged
that
state
officials
have
engaged
in
conspiracy--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor,
but
this
fellow
doesn't
have
much
confidence
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
he
was
convicted,
and
he
says
as
a
result
of
the
conspiracy.
[laughter]
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
that's
what
i
was
driving
at
before.
that's
right.
but
for
the--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--that
certainly
is
a
heavy
burden.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
that
may
be
a
way
to
address
the
floodgates
problem,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
well,
frankly,
i
think
he
would
have
a
difficult
time
in
proving
the
amount
of
damages
that
he's
alleged,
and
that
even
though
there
is
the
state
malpractice
"but
for"
proposition,
that
he
may
have
a
difficult
time
obtaining
damages
if
he
could
not
prove
that
this
conviction
was
a
result
of
conspiracy.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
he
believe
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
to--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--yes.
he
believed
that
he
was
innocent.
he
was
obtaining
to
obtain
psychiatric
records.
he
had
been
hospitalized,
and
he
alleged
that
part
of
the
conspiracy
was
that
his...
that
state
officials
persuaded
his
public
defender
to
fail
to
obtain
those
defense
records.
and,
as
part
of
that
conspiracy,
he
was
not
able,
then,
to
raise
the
defense
that
he
wanted
to
raise,
and
that's
the
problem.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
he
was
convicted
without
due
process
of
law.
he
was--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--well,
your
honor,
at
this
time
this
fellow
is
out
of
prison,
and
a
petition
of
habeas
corpus
does
him
no
good.
also,
for
the
general
purposes
of
these
cases
where--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--he
may
be.
he's...
he
served
36
months,
35
to
38
months
out
a
ten-year
sentence.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
i
do
not
know.
he
probably
is
on
some
sort
of
probation.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
legislative
history
of
1983,
just
in
the
enactment
itself,
where
this
court
has
interpreted
1983
and
polk
county
v.
dodson,
that
a
public
defender
is
immune--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--there
is
nothing,
other
than
the
act
itself,
the
language
of
the
act
itself.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
i
would
suggest
that
that
language
holds
that...
or
would
dictate
that
public
defenders,
during
the
course
of
traditional
defense
functions,
would
be
immune,
would
be
effectively
immune
from
a
lawsuit
brought
by
a
dissatisfied
client.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
defense
attorney
does
not
perform
a
quasi-judicial
function,
regardless
of
the
funding
that
is
afforded
to
the
defense
attorney,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
state
is
the
source
of
the
funds.
the
defense
attorney
doesn't
perform
the
quasi-judicial
function.
as
i've
said
before,
the
defense
attorney
performs
the
private
function.
the
defense
attorney
does
not
consider
the
public
interest
in
this
case,
and
in
every
other
case
that
the
court's
looked
at,
it's
been...
it's
determined
whether
or
not
a
quasi-judicial
function
has
been
performed.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
that's
the
only
case
where
a
private
party
has
been
afforded
immunity
without
performing
a
quasi-judicial
function.
but
in
that
case,
what
the
court
was
very
impressed
with
was
that
the
witness
performs,
in
essence,
a
public
interest
and
it
aids
the
judicial
system
in
that
it
helps
us
get
to
the
truth.
the
more
that
a
witness
is
able
to
speak
without
the
threat
of
subsequent
intimidation,
subsequent
lawsuits,
we
get
to
the
truth
of
the
matter.
in
this
case,
where
we're
saying
that
a
defense
attorney
should
be
allowed
to
conspire
with
no
liability
under
1983,
that
policy
that
underlies
the
witness
immunity
is
not
advanced
by
a
holding
of
immunity
in
this
case.
we
injure
the
judicial
process
to
the
extent
that
we
don't
preserve
the
adversarial
process,
which
in
itself--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--your
honor,
i
would
believe
that
a
witness
who
testifies
and
perjures
him
or
herself
should
be
liable.
now,
under
briscoe,
where
the
police
officer,
where
it
was
alleged
that
the
police
officer
perjured
himself,
that
was
held
to
be
within
the
functions
that
a
witness
performs,
and
at
least
there's
a
trier
of
fact
to
sort
out
the
truth
from
a
lie.
where
you
have
a
defense
attorney
as
the
last
hope
for
an
indigent
accused
who
is
granted
immunity,
then
there
is
no
way
at
all
to
find
the
truth
in
a
matter.
there's
no
way
at
all
where
the
defense
attorney,
the
prosecutor,
the
judge,
witnesses,
all
would
conspire
or
all
would
act
outside
traditional
defense
functions;
there's
no
last...
there's
no
other
hope.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
i
would
submit
that
it
probably
does
not
occur
very
often,
your
honor,
and
i
would
hope
that
it
does
not
occur
very
often.
i
would
also
suggest
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
have
only
been
eight
malpractice
claims
against
criminal
defense
attorneys
over
the
reported
history,
that
justice
o'connor's
point,
that
there
are
not
a
whole
lot...
there
just
aren't
a
whole
lot
of
these
claims
that
have
merit
to
them.
to
the
extent
that
there
are
some,
they
should
be
addressed.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
public
defender
performs
in
the
interest
of
the
public
in
providing
efficient
and
economic
assistance
to
indigent
accused,
we
should
not
take
that
liability
away.
i
think
that
it
would
be
the,
perhaps,
the
congress
which
should,
or
the
state
legislatures
which
should
provide
additional
funding
for
the
provision
of
indigent
defense
services;
that
it's
up
to
the
legislature
to
fund
those
principles
which
this
court
believes
are
very
important,
and
obviously
this
court
believes
that
effective
assistance
to
indigent
accused
is
important.
amicus
professional
criminal
lawyers'
defense
associations,
both
state
and
national,
who
have
joined
us
in
saying
there
should
be
no
immunity
for
the
public
defender,
both
understand
and
both
have
advanced
the
argument
that
a
finding
of
immunity
does
nothing
at
all
to
advance
the
effective
representation
of
accused.
it's
also
clear
that
the
common
law
immunity,
which
under...
common
law
immunity
from
defamation...
was
also
advanced
to
see
that
attorneys
did
not
fear
subsequent
litigation
in
the
defense
attorneys'
role
in
judicial
proceedings.
again,
this
was
to
make
sure
that
all
the
facts
were
out
onto
the
table,
and
so
that
the
courts
could
get
to
the
truth
of
the
matter.
to
the
extent
that
we're
asked
at
this
point
to
advance
a
policy
from
1983
liability
to...
to
the
extent
that
we're
asked
to
see
that
immunity
from
1983
claims
should
lie,
we're
not
asked
to
accept
that
because
that
policy
advances
the
truth.
the
only
thing
we're
asked
to
do
that
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
more
efficient
expenditure
of
state
resources.
and
that's
why,
i
think,
that
the
legislature
would
be
the
proper
authority
to
see
that
there
are
sufficient
funds
to
protect
constitutional
rights
and
to
provide
effective
assistance
to
the
accused.
i
would
also
point
out
that,
although
there
is
a
speculative
burden
that
the
courts
may
be...
there
is
a
speculative
overburden
argument.
it
is
speculative.
in
addition
to
that,
police
officers,
who
are
the
most
likely
target
of
1983
litigation,
members
of
the
executive
branch,
are
only
afforded
a
qualified
immunity,
not
an
absolute
immunity.
we're
asked
to
provide
an
absolute
immunity
for
the...
this
court's
been
asked
to
provide
absolute
immunity,
based
on
the
fact
that
there
will
be
an
overburdening
of
the
courts
and
an
overburdening
of
the
public
defender's
office
itself.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
well,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--okay.
i
don't
think
that
a
qualified
immunity
would
be
very
helpful
in
this
case
for
two
reasons:
one,
the
public
defender
is
not
a
public
official.
qualified
immunity
is
designed
to
aid
public
officials
in
seeing
that
their
duties
are
performed.
there's
a
public
interest
in
seeing
that
they
perform
their
duties
without
subsequent
fear
of
litigation.
also,
in
regard
to
the
qualified
immunity,
there's
a
good
faith
test,
and
at
any
time
a
defense
attorney
conspires
with
a
state
appellate
or
a
state
trial
judge
or
the
prosecutor,
that
there
can't
be
good
faith.
and
so
the
qualified
immunity
wouldn't
work
in
this
situation.
glover
would
still
win
under
a
qualified
immunity,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
the
best
rule
that
this
court
could
come
up
with.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
he's
acting
under
color
of
state
law
here,
only
because
he
has
conspired
with
state
officials.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
that's
right.
for
those
traditional
defense
functions,
obviously,
he
or
she
does
not
act
under
color
of
law.
but
when
there's
a
conspiracy
with
state
officials,
yes,
the
color
of
law
holds.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
well--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--well,
it's
clear
that
private
parties
who
conspire
with
state
officials
obtain
color
of
law,
act
under
color
of
law.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
well,
if
you
act
in
concurrence
with
the
state
official
to
further
the
state's
purpose,
you
are
acting
under
color
of
law.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
even
if
the
purpose
is
illegal,
especially
if
the
purpose
is
illegal.
you're
acting
under
color
of
law.
you're
conspiring,
you're
working
with
the
state.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
i
think
that
i
would
argue
that
the
public
officials--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--i
think
that
the
public
officials
have
subverted
his
defense
attorney.
i
would
argue
that.
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
yes,
it
does.
it
has
to
be
a
claim
of
conspiracy
to
get
under
color
of
law.
now,
for
other,
i
would--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--that's
right,
but
there
is
a
public
interest--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--well,
to
the
extent,
though,
under
1983
that
he
has
acted
under
color
of
law,
and
that
the
state
is
involved
here
or
the
government
is
involved
with
the
private
citizen
to
deprive
another
of
constitutional
rights,
he
should
have
an
avenue
of
redress,
a
federal
avenue
of
redress
under
1983.
i
would
submit
that
the
court--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--because
the
public
defender
performs
such
a
unique
role,
the
public
defender
is
the
representative
of
the
accused
and,
necessarily,
to
maintain
the
adversarial
tradition
that
is
paramount
in
ascertaining
truth,
the
public
defender
should
not
be...
the
public
defender
may
perform
a
critical
role
in
the
judicial
process,
but
that
alone
is
not
enough
to
make
it
the
quasi-judicial
role,
or
to--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--your
honor,
i
understand
that,
but
i
think,
again,
that
the
mere
location
as
part
of
the
judicial
function
is
not
enough
to
avoid
immunity.
we
have
to
look
at
the
role
that
each
person
plays
in
the
judicial
proceeding
and,
to
the
extent
that
a
public
defender
performs
only
in
the
accused's
behalf
and
that
that
adversarial
process
is
designed
to
seek
the
truth,
to
get
the
truth
out,
which--
mr.
craig
k.
edwards
--i
think
that
the
greater
public
interest
is
in
maintaining
a
strong
adversarial
process.
