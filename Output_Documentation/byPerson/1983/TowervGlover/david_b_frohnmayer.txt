mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
narrow
subject
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
public
defenders
are
immune
from
their
clients'
section
1983
claims
when
they
are
cast
as
conspiracies.
but
the
broader
question
directly
implicated
is
whether
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
in
this
court
must
countenance
conspiracy
claims
which
act
to
undermine
effectively
the
independence
and
functioning
of
the
state
in
judicial
processes.
this
court
has
previously
recognized
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system
by
granting
absolute
immunity
to
three
of
its
four
vital
participants:
judges,
witnesses,
and
prosecutors.
this
case
presents
an
opportunity
to
close
the
fourth
side
of
an
iron
rectangle
of
protection
for
the
judicial
process
by
acknowledging
the
immunity
of
the
public
defender.
extension
of
this
protection
obviously
goes
beyond
the
mere
desire
for
geometric
symmetry,
because
it
enhances,
rather
than
endangers,
the
capacity
of
states
to
provide
indigent
defense
counsel
in
accordance
with
the
command
of
this
court
in
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
in
gideon
v.
wainwright.
in
urging
reversal
of
the
ninth
circuit,
below
we
submit
four
propositions
this
morning.
first
is
that
public
defender
immunity
from
section
1983
conspiracy
claims
is,
in
fact,
necessary
to
protect
against
destructive
suits
which
themselves
threaten
the
integrity
and
finality
of
the
judicial
process
itself.
second,
that
public
defender
immunity
is
necessary
to
protect
the
institution
of
public
defender
as
one
of
the
most
effective
methods
of
meeting
sixth
amendment
mandates.
our
third
contention
and
proposition
is
that
public
defender
immunity,
in
fact,
best
serves
the
interests
of
indigent
clients.
and,
finally,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
there
exist
alternative
remedies
for
those
few
abuses
which
might
exist
which
amply
justify
the
grant
of
absolute
immunity.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
this
case
are
simple
and
have
been
exhaustively
reviewed
in
the
briefs
of
counsel.
we
note
simply
that
respondent
glover,
a
convicted
burglar
brought
a
pro
se
1983
claim
against
his
state
and
county
public
defenders.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
mr.
chief
justice,
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
course,
just
present
the
issue
of
public
defender.
some
of
the
policies
which
we
urge
and
favor,
obviously,
would
extend
to
the
whole
gamut
of
counsel,
although
we
do
not
argue
their
case
precisely
because
we
believe
that
the
most
forceful
case
for
immunity,
if
immunity
is
to
be
granted,
does
in
fact
lie
with
the
public
defender
institution.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
and
the
difference,
justice
brennan,
is
this...
and
whether
the
difference
would
cause
any
difference
in
result,
of
course,
is
open
to
question.
the
difference
is
that
the
appointed
counsel
does
have
the
option
as
to
whether
or
not
to
accept
a
particular
appointment,
whereas
those
cases
which
come
to
the
public
defender
office
are
ones
which
the
public
defender
has
no
capacity
to
refuse.
the
intake
of
that
office
is
fixed;
the
risks
may
be
high;
and
the
public
defender
has
no
way
of
minimizing
the
risks
of
a
highly
litigious
group
of
people.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
they
could.
we
are
simply
suggesting
to
the
court
that
absolute
immunity
did
apply
to
all
counsel
at
common
law
with
respect
to
defamation
proceedings,
and
that
if
one
locks
at
the
contemporary
policy
and
the
contemporary
structure
of
indigent
defense,
there
is
a
continuum
on
which
the
strongest
case,
then,
can
be
made
for
the
public
defender;
a
slightly
less
strong
case
made
for
the
appointed
counsel;
and
perhaps
the
weakest,
but
perhaps
still
an
acceptable
case,
made
be
made
for
privately-retained
defense
counsel.
that's
our
position.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
that
that
is
the
tradition,
chief
justice
burger,
but
i
think
that
the
common
practice
in
some
jurisdictions,
obviously,
gives
counsel
who
wish
to
be
appointed
some
flexibility
in
determining
whether
they
wish
to
be
on
the
list
for
a
particular
court
or
for
a
particular
time.
and
with
reference
to
history,
there
is
an
interesting
point
which
is
raised
by
the
kaus
citation
on
page
28
of
the
respondent's
briefs,
the
ucla
study
of
the
english
practice
at
common
law
for
at
least
200
years.
and
the
import
of
that
common
law
immunity
from
malpractice
actions
in
criminal
defense
proceedings
for
english
barristers
was,
in
part,
grounded
on
the
fact
that
the
english
barrister
at
common
law
has
no
discretion
to
refuse
a
client
and
does
not
have
the
contractual
relationship
with
the
client,
but
must
instead
take
whatever
accused
criminal
walks
in
the
door
as
his
client
on
behalf
of
the
solicitor
who
offers
the
brief
to
the
barrister.
so,
in
that
respect,
there
is
a
strong
comparison
between
the
policy
reasons
underlying
the
english
common
law
immunity
from
malpractice
actions
or
barristers,
and
that
which
obtains
most
strongly,
we
believe,
in
the
case
of
the
public
defender
with
respect
to
immunity
that
we're
arguing
in
this
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
with
respect
to--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
in
the
state
of
oregon,
the
private
legal
aid
society
does
not
provide
for
criminal
defense.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
we
would
submit
that
many
of
the
common
law
arguments
for
immunity
and
many
of
the
policy
arguments
for
immunity
would
apply
equally
to
the
private
legal
aid
organization,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
could
not
control
its
intake.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
may
well
be
that
they
cannot,
and
if
they
cannot--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes.
under
the
reasoning
that
we
advance,
they
would
be
immune.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
because
of
the
nature
of
the
risk
which
they
accept.
if
99
percent
of
the
client
population
that
they
have
is
a
client
population
that
they
are
not,
in
effect,
practically
free
to
refuse,
then
the
same
degree
of
risk
affects
the
operation
of
their
criminal
defense
activities.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
under
some
of
the
policies
that
we
urge,
yes.
under
the
most--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--your
honor,
this
is
a
very
interesting
point
because--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
find--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--justice
white,
we
have
found
in
the
authority
cited
by
respondent
on
page
28
of
its
brief,
that
there
are
only
eight
reported
criminal
defense
malpractice
cases
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
up
until
the
year
1984.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
is--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
a
malpractice
suit
which
arises
from
the
conduct
of
a
criminal
defense.
there
are
eight.
and
that
is
all.
none
of
them
prior
to
1871.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
not
from
a
malpractice
suit,
but--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--he's
different
in
two
respects,
justice
white,
and
those
two
respects
are,
first
of
all,
that
the
client
does
have
an
independent
contract
remedy
against
the
attorney;
and,
secondly,
the
client
has
an
economic
incentive
not
to
urge
the
pressing
of
frivolous
claims
on
behalf
of
his
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
don't
believe
that
you
have.
if
you're
referring
to
the
ferri
v.
ackerman
case,
all
this
court
held
was
that
the
criminal
justice
act
did
not,
by
itself,
import
an
immunity
which
would
apply
in
a
state
malpractice
proceeding.
it
is
not,
in
our
judgment,
a
holding
to
any
degree
that
the
federal
common
law
under
1983
justifies
a
malpractice
action
against
lawyers,
and,
in
fact,
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
depends
on
the
state.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
issue
has
never
been
litigated
by
the
oregon
supreme
court.
it
has
recognized,
in
the
case
of
watt
v.
gurkey,
which
this
court
cited
in
imbler
v.
pachtman,
the
prosecutorial
immunity
exists
as
in
absolute
manner,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
oregon
supreme
court
would
follow
that
case
in--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
must
look
at
the
oregon
statutes
cast
against
the
rationale
of
this
court's
analysis
in
polk
county
v.
dodson.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
what
if
he
is
not
exerting
state
authority?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
unless
there
is
conspiratorial...
unless
there
is
the
allegation
of
conspiratorial
liability,
which
is
the
issue
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
from
state
actions
at
common
law
or
statutorily
based?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
there's
not,
and
we're
not
contending
that's
the
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
correct,
and
we
have
not
suggested
to
the
court
that
it
need
decide
that.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
no.
i
was
simply
suggesting
a
continuum
of
different
forms
of
legal
representation.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
not.
i
think
not,
for
several
reasons:
first
of
all,
it
was
not
until
this
court's
decisions
in
ferri
v.
ackerman
and
polk
county
v.
dodson,
that
any
of
the
lower
circuit
or
district
courts
in
this
country
believed
that
there
was
any
question
but
that
the
public
defender
was
immune.
secondly,
one
has
to
recognize
that
with
all
of
the
other
actors
in
the
criminal
justice
process
which
convicts
a
particular
defendant
possessing
immunity,
the
last
and
perhaps
only
target
for
the
person
who
feels
unjustifiably
disappointed
at
his
or
her
conviction
will
lock
to
the
public
defender
as
a
way
of
reopening
the
validity
of
the
entire
criminal
justice
process
that
convicted
that
person.
and
so
in
that...
and
beyond
that
point,
i
think
there's
quite
a
difference,
and
i
believe
that
the
turner
study
that
we
cited
in
our
brief
would
at
least
partially
bear
this
out.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
mind
of
many
persons
who
are
incarcerated,
between
the
availability
of
a
federal
remedy
and
the
availability
of
a
state
remedy.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
in
the
situation
in
which
he
is
alleged
to
have
conspired,
as
the
facts
would
have
indicated
here,
yes.
we--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes.
we
believe
that
a
case
can
be
made
for
immunity
there.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
because
that
leads,
really,
to
one--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
the
allegation
is
that
there
exists
state
action
under
the
dennis
v.
sparks
theory,
because--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
for
the
same
reason
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--under
section
1983
under
a
conspiracy
claim
of
this
kind,
yes.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
for
the
same
reason
that
1983
is
alleged
to
be
present
in
this
case.
and
that
is
that
the
public
defender--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
if
i
may
submit
this,
justice
marshall,
under
this
court's
holding
in
polk
county
v.
dodson,
the
fact
that
a
statute
authorizes
the
operation
of
the
public
defender
was
not
sufficient,
in
this
court's
judgment
in
that
case,
to
add
the
color
of
law
requirement
for
1983
jurisdiction.
it
was...
and
the
only
reason
that
his
case
is
different
than
this
court's
holding
in
polk
county
v.
dodson
is
the
additional
allegation
of
a
conspiracy
between
state
court
judges
and
state
administrative
officials
with
which
the
public
defender--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
i
thought
that
you
were
saying,
justice
marshall,
that
you
were
simply
changing
the
facts
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me
so
that
it
would
be
a
volunteer
attorney
instead
of
a
public
defender.
in
the
facts
that
you
get
me,
there
is
no
color
of
state
law
at
all.
there's
no
1983
jurisdiction.
that's
a
different
issue.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
you
don't
need
to
reach
the
immunity
issue
because
there's
no
19--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
may
be
that
he
could.
our
suggestion
is
that,
based
upon--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
because
there's
no
federal
cause
of
action
under
which
he
can
claim
the
immunity.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
we
are
arguing
a
section
1983
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
and
if--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's
correct.
if
there's
any--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's
right.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
extend
the
reason--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
think
this
is
the
case
in
which
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
say
it.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
and
that
is
the
issue
that
we
believe
this
court
reserved
in
footnote
4
of
its
decision
in
polk
county
v.
dodson.
if
there
is
anything
that
i
have
said
in
response
to
the
court's
questioning
to
this
time
that
indicates
that
we
wish
to
have
an
immunity
to
extend
to
other
actions
not
arising
under
color
of
state
law
under
1983,
that
was
a
mistaken
apprehension,
and
that
is
not
our
contention
before
this
court.
it
is
not
part
of
the
case
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
we
believe--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
find
it
very
difficult
to
give
a
principle
distinction
from
the
dennis
conclusion
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
that's
one
of
the
inescapable
problems
with
the
dennis
analysis,
but
it
follows
so
soundly
on
this
court's
earlier
decisions,
that
we
do
not
urge
you
today
to
reconsider
the
dennis
case.
the
only
possible
distinction
between
the
dennis
case
and
this
one
is
that
in
the
dennis
case,
it
was
the
immune
state
official
himself
who
took
the
action;
that
is,
the
judge
took
the
action
to
take
the
bribe
or
be
subject
to
undue
influence
and
change
his
decision;
whereas
in
this
case,
it
might
be
argued
that
the
public
defender
who
is
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law
under
your
polk
county
decisions
was
the
ultimate
actor
who
is
alleged
to
have
the
fault.
but
that
is
a
method
of
distinguishing
the
dennis
case.
but
if
that
method
is
not
accepted
as
an
appropriate
distinction,
then
this
court,
we
believe,
must
squarely
face
the
question.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
conspiracy
allegation,
as
the
ninth
circuit
acknowledged,
justice
brennan,
is
somewhat
vague.
the
allegation
is
that
the
state
court
judges
and
administrative
officials
conspired
or
colluded
with
the
trial
and
appellate
public
defenders
to
cause
or
persuade
the
public
defenders
not
to
perform
their
duties
in
urging
certain
arguments
at
trial
and
in
excising
certain
key
arguments
from
the
brief
that
the
defendant
wished
to
pursue.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
all
we
have
is
the
face
of
the
pleadings
this
comes
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there
has
been
no
discovery.
in
fact,
there's
been
no
clarification
of
the
complaint.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
believe
that
it
had
not.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
justice
powell,
we
don't
know,
of
course,
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
was
rendered
after
this
court's
decision,
both
in
ferri
v.
ackerman
and
polk
county.
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
note,
in
footnote
1
concluding
its
opinion,
that
although
vaguely
put,
the
allegations
of
conspiracy
were
probably
adequate
on
their
face,
however
much
we
might
differ
with
that
view.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
our
problem,
justice
rehnquist
and,
in
fact,
that's
the
anomaly
that
this
case
creates
after
this
polk
county
v.
dodson.
there
is
only
one
species
of
section
1983
liability
to
which
a
public
defender
is
subject,
and
that
is
the
species
of
1983
claim
that
says
there
is
a
conspiracy.
and
that,
we
find
not
only
anomalous,
but
we
find,
indeed,
deeply
harmful
to
the
criminal
justice
process.
we
find
it
harmful
to
the
judicial
process
itself.
the
first
of
our
arguments
was
that,
in
fact,
immunity
is
accepted
for
those
participants
in
the
judicial
process.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
if
the
public--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
would
hope
that
he
would.
and
under
oregon--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--absolutely
not,
for
a
very
important
reason,
and
it's
the
same
reason
that
applies
to
the
distinction
that
this
court
has
drawn
between
the
use
of
18
united
states
code
242,
the
criminal
color
of
law
provisions,
and
the
civil
rights
provisions
under
1983;
that
is,
that
you
have
a
prosecutor
who
has
the
responsibility,
under
a
set
of
professional
ethics,
to
screen
complaints,
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
the
vindictive
or
frivolous
complaint
that
comes.
and
so
the
prosecutor
and
the
grand
jury
act
as
essential
guards
to
the
floodgate
of
litigation,
because
they
are
able
to
screen
the
frivolous
from
the
well-taken
claim.
and
in
that
respect,
we
think
that
there
is
a
very
significant
difference.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
but
he's
not
subject
to
a
serious
risk
of
being
sued
frivolously.
and
the
point
that
we
make
is
this:
we
do
not
believe
that
the
problem
with
section
1983
lawsuits
is
that
they
will
succeed;
our
contention
is
that
the
cost
of
vindication
of
the
public
defender
in
these
suits
is
too
high
in
the
process.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
because
there
exist
the
prosecutorial
control
and
the
grand
jury
control.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
but
the
point,
justice
white,
is
that
there
clearly
are
screening
devices
which
do
not
cause
such
a
massive
diversion
of
the
public
defender's
time
from
the
duty
for
which
the
public
defender
is
hired,
and
that
is
to
fulfill
the
sixth
amendment
mandate
and
represent
defenseless
indigents.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
absolutely,
it
is.
it's
the
diversion
of
time
from
the
duties.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
is
possible
that
he
could.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
we
don't
know
from
the
oregon,
justice--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
sir.
but
we
certainly
don't
believe
that
a
duplication
of
spurious
litigation
is
any--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we're
not
certain,
but
what
we
believe
is
that
any
diversion
of
the
public
defender's
time
to
answer
frivolous
litigation
is
a
diversion
which
deprives
the
public
defender
and
the
states
of
the
responsibility
to
meet
a
sixth
amendment
mandate.
and
that
is
a
stronger
reason
for
immunity
than
this
court
recognized
in
the
briscoe
case,
where
the
police
officer's
time
was
diverted
by
virtue
of
being
a
witness
and
then
having
to
testify
in
1983
proceedings.
but
the
police
officer
did
not
have
a
constitutional
mandate
to
fulfill
in
the
time
that
was
taken
away
by
defending
frivolous
court
actions,
and
that
is
the
case
in
this
instance.
and
it's
beyond
that
point
it
goes
to
the
question
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
public
defender
or
perhaps,
indeed,
of
any
defense
counsel
in
a
judicial
proceeding
where
all
of
the
other
participants
in
that
proceeding
are
immune
from
suit.
it
makes
the
public
defender
uniquely
vulnerable
to
the
vindictive
litigant,
because
that
is
the
last
and
only
place
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
fact
finding
process,
in
fact,
can
be
undermined.
and
that
is--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--malpractice
insurance
exists
in
oregon,
justice
marshall,
for--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
exists
for
members
of
the
private
bar.
for
the
public
defender
and
for
public
employees,
the
state
has
a
torque
liability
fund
which
is
established
under
chapter
30.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
state
public
defender
is
insured
by
the
state
for
his
defense,
as
long
as
it
does
not
involve
willful
or
wanton
misconduct.
we
advance
to
the
court
one
other
proposition
in
connection
with
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process,
and
it's
one
that
we
think
is
extremely
important.
these
claims,
sounding
in
conspiracy
as
they
do,
will
be
extraordinarily
difficult
to
defeat
in
some
proceedings,
even
when
they
are
frivolous.
that
point
has
been
examined
in
great
detail
in
this
court's
past
decisions,
and
it's
an
extremely
telling
one
as
it
applies
to
the
public
defender
here;
because,
in
fact,
it
is
very
difficult
to
imagine,
for
example,
as
justice
stevens'
opinion
pointed
out
earlier
this
last
term,
a
good
faith
defense
conspiracy.
in
virtually
every
case,
we
believe
a
defense
will
be
required
on
the
merits,
because
what's
alleged
is
conspiracy,
what's
alleged
is
the
allegation
that
a
state
of
mind
was
a
certain
way,
an
the
controversion
of
those
points
simply
would
not,
we
believe,
be
significant
enough
to
allow
the
summary
judgment
procedure
to
be
utilized
to
dispose
of
these
kinds
of
claims
in
summary
proceedings.
so,
for
that
reason,
we
think
it's
extremely
important
that
the
court
recognize
that
the
large
burden
on
the
public
defender
office,
the
diversion
from
attending
to
clients
when
there
is
a
fixed
pool
of
resources
to
deal
with
them,
is,
we
think,
extremely
important.
we
also
submit
to
the
court
this
proposition:
the
public
defender's
office,
the
public
defender
concept,
by
every
study
we
have
come
across,
is
the
most
widely-utilized,
the
most
cost-effective,
and
the
most
efficient
in
delivering
indigent
legal
services
as
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
mandate.
if
states
such
as
oregon
or
others
who
sponsor
public
indigent
defense
programs
are
subject
to
liability
for
the
defense
of
an
increasing
burden
of
suits,
then
that
kind
of
experimentation,
which
is
the
most
effective
way
of
realizing
the
gideon
v.
wainwright
mandate,
we
believe,
will
not
be
effectively
fulfilled.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
we
take
strong
issue
with
the
contentions
just
advanced
by
respondent.
the
public
defender
does
play
a
critical
role
in
the
judicial
process.
that's
the
basis
of
the
common
law
immunity
in
defamation
which
extends
to
all
participants
in
the
adversary
process.
this
court
has
recognized
that
vital
role
in
its
decision
in
the
butz
case,
where,
without
question,
those
participants
who
were
advocates,
irrespective
of
the
side
they
occupied,
even
in
an
administrative
agency
proceeding
were
accorded
absolute
immunity
by
this
court.
it's
the
same
statement
that
is
made
by
this
court
in
imbler
v.
pachtman.
there
is
a
public
purpose
that
is
served
that
is
not
merely
of
policy
importance.
it
has
constitutional
dimension,
and
that
is
because
the
public
defender
or
any
advocate
for
the
defense
is
serving
a
sixth
amendment
purpose.
we
suggest
that
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
fearless
advocacy
ought
to
be
furthered
by
the
grant
of
absolute
immunity,
and
we
suggest
one
of
the
other
policy
bases
that
has
also
always
underlain
this
court's
decisions,
and
that
is
the
undesirability
of
having
further
federal
court
reexamination
of
the
entire
trial
process
at
the
state
level
through
this
kind
of
subversion.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
true,
and
there
is
a
state
proceeding,
a
post-conviction
proceeding
in
oregon,
which
would
allow--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
may
well
be,
if
that
were
an
exhaustion
requirement
or
a
preclusion
requirement
that
either
the
state
or
the--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
although
the
issues
that
one
brings
up
in
habeas
corpus
proceeding
would
be
directed
to
the
underlying
constitutional
violation--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
but
at
least--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
we
believe
that
there
is
likely
to
be
an
increasing
caseload,
simply
because
it
was
not
until
recent
years
that
there
was
even
thought
to
be
any
question
about
the
public
defender's
immunity
or
the
immunity
of
defense
counsel.
so
we
believe
that
simply
looking
to
a
preclusive
or
some
other
method
of
achieving
collateral
estoppel
through
a
state
or
federal
habeas
remedy,
while
one
way
of
dealing
with
this
problem,
is
not
as
symmetrical
as
we
think
is
desirable
to
deal
with
the
protection
of
the
judicial
process
itself,
for
the
independent
reasons
that
we
have
just
suggested,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
to
use
section
198...
i
think
that
still
hangs
in
the
balance,
justice
o'connor.
it's
not
clear
even
now
how
much
success
a
plaintiff
has
to
enjoy
in
a
section
1988...
83
action
before
attorneys'
fees
are
awarded,
even
in
light
of
last
court's
decisions.
it
certainly
is
some
incentive,
but
bear
in
mind
that
counsel
can
be
appointed
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
and
counsel
can
be
appointed
in
state
post-conviction
proceedings,
whereby
these
issues
can
be
dealt
with
in
a
logical
manner
without
involving,
ab
initio,
the
state...
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
section
1983.
we
submit
also
that
when
learned
counsel
for
the
respondent
says
that
the
public
defender
has
no
obligation
to
urge
the
frivolous,
that
the
obvious
retort
is,
yes,
but
he
doesn't
have
any
obligation
not
to
be
sued
either.
and
here,
the
public
defenders
are
asked
for
$10
million
and
the
state
of
oregon
must
provide
their
defense,
probably
beyond
a
summary
judgment
proceeding,
and
the
cost
can
be
catastrophic;
catastrophic,
not
merely
for
the
system
because
it
diverts
from
a
fixed
class
of
indigent
defendants
whose
defense
will
no
longer
be
adequately
prepared
because
of
the
loss
of
that
person
from
an
office,
but
it
will
cause
advocates
to
make
a
paper
trail,
a
stream
of
consciousness
paper
trail
about
every
trial
tacticle
decision;
it
will
force
them
to
explain
why
every
piece
of
the
brief
ended
up
on
the
cutting
room
floor
instead
of
before
the
court.
that's
not
the
kind
of
advocacy
which
this
court's
decisions
have
encouraged,
and
that's
not
what
is
in
the
interest
of
the
public.
thank
you.
