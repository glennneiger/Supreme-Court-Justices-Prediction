unknown
speaker
what
do
we
mean,
exactly,
mr.
fellner,
by
the
term
"withdrawing
employer"?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
how
does
that
come
about
contractually?
the
next
time
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
up,
the
employer
just
says,
i
won't
agree
to
make
any
contributions
to
the
pension
fund?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fellner,
may
i
ask
one
question?
it
is
a
little
bit
like
justice
rehnquist's
in
a
way.
could
you
just,
when
it
is
convenient
for
you,
kind
of
explain
to
me
how
the
magnitude
of
the
withdrawal
liability
is
calculated?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
of
the
entire
unfunded
vested
benefits
or
just
the
employees
for
whom
the
particular
employers
contributed?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the...
i
may
just
show
my
ignorance
here,
but
i
might
as
well
show
it
now
rather
than
later,
i
guess.
what
is
the
typical
collective
bargaining
agreement
provision
that
an
employer
enters
into
with
a
union?
it
is
not
to
ultimately
pay
a
pension
liability
to
a
retired
employee,
but
simply
to
pay
a
certain
contribution
per
employee?
unknown
speaker
but
now
do
those
agreements
also
bind
the
employers?
unknown
speaker
but
the
typical
collective
bargaining
agreement
doesn't
contain
a
provision
whereby
an
employer
promises
to
pay
any
individual
employee
a
pension
of
so
much
at
the
time
he
retires.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question
if
i
could,
because
i
think
i
have
the
concept
in
mind
now.
with
respect
to
the
amount
that
the...
the
withdrawal
liability
that
these
three
companies
incurred,
how
did
that
amount
compare
with
the
total
contributions
they
had
made
during
the
preceding
five-year
period?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
three
cases
discussed
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
unknown
speaker
it
had
been
making
$65,000
a
year
roughly?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
five
years
about
$300,000
he
had
contributed,
and
he
has
to
come
up
with
another
$200,000.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
typical
of
the
other
two,
also?
unknown
speaker
they
are
roughly
the
same
ratio?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fellner,
when
you
say
that,
it
spread
the
pain
around,
it
did
keep
advancing
the
date,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what,
under
political
pressure
by
organizations
with
clout?
how
do
you
apologize
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
this
argument
critical
to
your
winning
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
have
certainly
been
giving
it
a
lot
of
emphasis.
unknown
speaker
what
will
the...
what
are
the
trustees
free
to
use
this
money
for?
and
let's
take
the
case
of
the
$200,000
liability.
under
that
plan,
what
can
the
trustees
use
the
money
for?
unknown
speaker
so
it
can,
instead
of
holding
it
to
safeguard
against
unfunded
liabilities,
it
could
just
increase
the
benefits
and
spend
it
all,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
fellner,
what
if
it
were
a
perfectly
healthy
trust?
what
if
there
were
no
unfunded
liabilities
that
you
know
of?
or
what
if
you
think
it
isn't
about
to
go
broke?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
if
there
is
but
it
really
isn't
a...
it
isn't
in
any
kind
of
shaky
condition?
unknown
speaker
you
never
know.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
say,
would
you,
that
every
pension
plan
in
the
country
is
so
questionable
that
every
single
one
of
them
needs
to
be
protected
like
this.
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
don't
need
this
kind
of
protection.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
justice
white's
case,
if
i
may.
you
answered
by
saying
the
trustees
have
a
fiduciary
duty,
but
the
trustees
don't
always
set
the
level
of
benefits.
you
could
have
a
new
bargaining
session
a
year
later
and
the
union
and
the
remaining
employers
might
decide
to
up
the
benefits
and
say
we've
got
this
extra
money
with
which
to
fund
additional
benefits.
no
reason
that
couldn't
happen,
as
long
as
the
plan
continued
to
be
actuarially
sound.
unknown
speaker
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
amount
that
the
withdrawing
employer
has
to
come
up
with
is
unaffected
by
the
change
in
the
size
of
the
population
of
potential
beneficiaries.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
his
employees
continue
to
be
beneficiaries
hired
by
somebody
else,
or
he
goes
out
of
business.
that
is
not
a
factor.
unknown
speaker
and
that
could
make
quite
a
difference
in
the
future
of
the
fund,
depending,
you
know,
what...
there
are
all
sorts
of
withdrawals,
is
what
i
am
saying,
and
they
are
all
treated
alike
for
this
purpose.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
which
ones
they
are?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it
would
be
perfectly
feasible
to
go
around
and
in
case
of
any
particular
trust
make
a
sensible
judgment
about
whether
it
was
actuarially
sound
or
not?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
what
if...
i
suppose
any
trust
that
you
would
say
is
actuarially
sound,
if
a
lot
of
employers
suddenly
withdrew,
your
judgment
might
change.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
if
that
criticism
were
a
ground
for
invalidating
legislation,
i
don't
know
where
we'd
be.

[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
mr.
triplett,
that
really...
the
normal
presumption
of
any
congressional
act
is
that
it
can
be
and
is
going
to
be
applied
as
of
the
date
that
congress
says
it
is
going
to
take
effect,
isn't
it,
even
though
that
date
may
be
before
enactment.
there
are
really
remarkably
few
cases
that
have
ever
upheld
a
challenge
to
an
act
of
congress
because
of
its
retroactive
application.
unknown
speaker
how
good
law
do
you
think
the
untermeyer
case
is
today?
i
mean,
it
was
a
sharply
divided
court
at
the
time,
and
i
don't
believe
it
has
ever
been
applied
since,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
follow
from
your
analysis,
i
suppose,
is
that
if
congress
were
to
undertake
a
sweeping
revision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
cut
out
a
lot
of
tax
shelters
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
it
couldn't...
and
everyone
knew
that
it
was
debating
that
for
six
months,
that
it
could
not
make
that
applicable
to
any
transaction
that
was
closed
before
the
date
that
the
president
signed
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
triplett,
getting
away
from
taxes,
don't
we
about
once
a
year
get
a
congressional
act
where
there
were
no
hearings,
no
notice,
and
it
was
written
on
the
floor,
and
we
have
upheld
them,
haven't
we?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
turner
elkhorn
under
this
thesis?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
were
just
suggesting
turner
elkhorn
was
just
wrongly
decided.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
law
that
was
applied
retroactively
to
supposedly
close
transactions.
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
a
fairness
argument.
i
mean,
as
long
as
it
is
fair,
you
can
make
it
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say,
then,
about,
in
this
case,
what
if
your
clients
had...
one
of
your
clients
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
a
three-year
contract,
and
he
contractually
just
couldn't
withdraw
when
this
law
went
into
effect?
do
you
think
prospective
application
of
withdrawal
liability
could
be
applied
to
that
client?
i
would
think
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
here.
unknown
speaker
which
might
measure
fundamental
fairness.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
in
fact,
if
your
basic
argument
is
one
of
fair
notice
to
the
citizen
to
make
a
choice
while
he
still
has
the
options
available
to
him--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
the
logic
of
your
argument
apply
to
those
employers
just
as
well
as
it
applies
to
the
happenstance
that
your
termination
date
happened
to
come
in
this
interim?
unknown
speaker
i
am
still
not
clear
on
how
you
differentiate
that
situation
from
one
in
which
the
expiration
date
was
a
couple
of
months
later.
does
the
employer...
do
you
contend
the
employer
had
the
right
to
bargain
out
the
renewal
without
having
the
thumb
on
the
scale
that
is
caused
by
this
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
you
knew
about
the
statute,
the
statute
has
the
effect
of
making
the
union's
bargaining
position
much
stronger
than
if
the
statute
weren't
there.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
saying
that...
you
don't
challenge
the
statute
simply
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
because
of
retroactivity.
this
is
because
of
prospective--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
triplett,
let
me
just
go
back
to
that
hypothetical
example.
wouldn't
that
be
equally
unfair
if
it
occurred
a
year
after
the
statute
became
effective?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
kind
of
a
contradiction
of
the
text
of
the
constitution,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
framers
pretty
well
hashed
this
out,
and
they
applied
prohibition
against
impairment
of
contracts
to
the
states
and
the
denial
of
due
process
prohibition
against
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
why
should
that
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
contract
clause
is
exhibit
a
that
would
tend
to
contradict
you,
i
think.
