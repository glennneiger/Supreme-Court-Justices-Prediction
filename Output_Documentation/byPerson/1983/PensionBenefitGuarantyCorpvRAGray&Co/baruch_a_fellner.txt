mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
ninth
circuit
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
with
respect
to
its
brief
retroactive
period.
we
submit
that
in
making
the
statute
in
question
retroactive,
congress
met
the
rationality
standard
under
the
turner
elkhorn
case,
and
acted
in
accord
with
tax
law
precedent.
the
statute
at
issue,
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act
of
1980
was
passed
after
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
of
congressional
deliberation
in
order
to
improve
the
financial
stability
of
over
2,000
multi-employer
plans
covering
approximately
eight
million
participants.
congress
perceived
that
the
greatest
threat
to
plan
stability
was
employer
withdrawals,
particularly
in
declining
industries.
such
withdrawals
cause
what
congress
called
a
downward
spiral.
they
reduce
the
amount
of
contributions
which
support
retirement
benefits,
necessitating
higher
contributions
from
remaining
employers,
and
thereby
cauterizing
their
withdrawals
from
these
plans,
obviously
jeopardizing
the
plan's
solvency.
now,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
as
of
1978,
10
percent
of
all
plans
covering
about
1.3
million
participants
were
experiencing
financial
difficulties,
and
therefore,
in
order
to
achieve
the
goal
of
overall
multi-employer
plan
stability,
congress
rationally
sought
to
eliminate
what
it
observed
were
the
incentives
encouraging
the
flight
from
plans,
and
to
cushion
the
financial
impact
of
such
withdrawals.
the
multi-employer
act
assesses
against
a
withdrawing
employer
a
reasonable
share
of
the
costs
of
funding
retirement
benefits.
we
submit--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--a
withdrawing
employer
is
an
employer
who
has
contributed
to
a
multi-employer
plan
and
chooses
to,
as
defined
under
the
statute,
cease
his
obligations,
cease
contributing
to
a
multi-employer
plan.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
there
are
a
variety
of
circumstances.
one,
the
expiration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
a
withdrawal
can
also
be
incurred
as
a
result
of
simply
closing
a
business
or
selling
a
business.
a
variety
of
different
and
i
dare
say
complex
circumstances
under
which
withdrawals
do
in
fact
occur
under
the
statute,
not
necessarily
linked
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
congress,
we
submit,
rationally
concluded
that
withdrawing
employers
should
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
unfunded
liabilities
they
leave
behind
rather
than
shifting
those
liabilities
to
remaining
employers,
to
employers
who
continue
to
contribute
to
multi-employer
plans.
withdrawal
liability
therefore,
we
submit,
was
the
cornerstone
of
the
legislative
recommendations
submitted
at
the
request
of
congress
by
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
on
february
27,
1979.
from
that
date
forward,
every
bill,
every
committee
report
incorporated
a
retroactive
date,
and
that
was
in
order
to
eliminate
the
incentive
to
withdraw
during
the
legislative
process.
indeed,
i
would
submit
that
it
was
the
very
openness
and
thoroughness
of
the
legislative
process
which
necessitated
the
retroactive
period.
congress
was
rational
in
legislating
retroactively
where
to
do
otherwise--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--withdrawal
liability
is
calculated
as
follows,
justice
stevens.
it
is
a
proportion
of
the
unfunded
vested
benefits.
unfunded
vested
benefits
are
defined
as
the
actuarial
present
value
of
the
retirement
benefits
that
have
to
be
paid
over
time.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
it
is
roughly
equivalent
to
the
contributions
which
the
employer
has
made
up
to
that
point.
if
i
may
describe
the
manner
in
which
it
is
computed,
the
amount
by
which
this
actuarial
equivalent
or
the
actuarial
amount
of
unfunded
vested
benefits
exceeds
the
assets
available
to
pay
them
over
time
is
multiplied
by
a
fraction
the
numerator
of
which
is
the
contributions
which
the
employer
has
made
over
a
five-year
period,
the
denominator
of
which
is
the
contributions
made
by
all
employers
to
this
plan
over
the
same
five-year
period.
and
therefore,
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
it
is
the
rough
equivalent
of
the
contributions
this
employer
has
made
up
to
that
point.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
the
typical
collective
bargaining
agreement
i
think
is
difficult
to
describe.
let
me
answer
the
question
as
follows.
this
court
decided
the
case
amex
coal.
in
amex
coal,
the
trust
agreement
bound
the
trustees
to
the
negotiated
benefits
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
other
words,
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
trust
agreements
take
different
forms.
many
of
them
are
precisely
as
you
have
described,
justice
rehnquist,
namely
that
employers
do
negotiate
only
the
contributions
which
they
ultimately
make.
however,
there
are
other
trust
agreements
which
bind
the
trustees
to
the
negotiated
for
benefits
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
one
example
of
which
is
amex
coal.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
clearly.
they
bind
the
employers
with
regard
to
the
contributions
which
they
make
which
support
specific
benefits
either
provided
for
in
the
trust
agreements
or
provided
for
explicitly
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct,
but
the
realities
of
collective
bargaining
we
submit,
however,
and
describe
in
detail
in
our
brief,
are
such
that
these
contributions
are
clearly
not
negotiated
in
a
vacuum.
they
are
negotiated
with
an
eye
toward
the
benefits
which
they
will
support.
now,
we
submit
that
congress
was--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--let
me
first
make
one
minor
correction
if
i
may,
justice
stevens.
before
the
court
this
morning
is
one
company.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that's
correct.
with
regard
to
the
company
which
is
before
the
court
this
morning,
and
then
i
will
get
to
g&r
and
shelter
in
a
moment
if
i
may,
with
regard
to
gray
construction
company,
gray
was
assessed
a
$201,000
withdrawal
liability.
in
the
alterative,
it
was
offered
the
opportunity
to
pay
$65,000
a
year,
which
was
almost
the
precise
equivalent
of
the
contributions
which
it
had
been
making
over
the
prior
five
year.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that's
correct.
now,
we
submit
that--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
we
submit
that
congress
was
therefore
rational
in
legislating
retroactively
where
to
do
otherwise
could
indeed
have
precipitated
the
very
conduct
that
congress
intended
to
restrain.
now,
under
the
turner
elkhorn
rationality
doctrine,
congress's
reasonable
decision
in
this
case
to,
as
it
were,
protect
the
efficacy
of
this
complex
legislation
through
a
brief
retroactive
period
is
entitled
to
judicial
deference.
contrary
to
the
court
below,
three
circuit
courts
upheld
that
turner
elkhorn
controls
the
disposition
of
the
constitutional
issues
before
this
court,
and
furthermore,
congress
carefully
measured
the
liability
imposed
on
withdrawing
employers.
it
enacted
numerous
moderating
provisions.
just
several
examples.
it
lessened
most
employers'
withdrawal
liability
by
as
much
as
$50,000,
particularly
aiming
that
provision
at
small
employers.
it
enacted
a
net
worth
limitation
on
the
liability
of
an
employer
which
sells
or
closes
its
business.
it
specifically
reduced
the
impact
of
retroactivity
on
certain
employers,
and
it
stretched
out
payments
over
as
much
as
20
years
and
made
them,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
the
rough
equivalent
of
prior
contributions.
moreover,
under
the
act
withdrawing
employers
bear
only
a
part
of
the
cost
of
plan
stability.
participants,
the
pensioners,
the
retirees
suffer
losses
because
the
levels
of
benefits
now
guaranteed
under
the
multi-employer
act
are
lower
than
the
levels
guaranteed
under
prior
law.
they,
too,
suffer
losses.
remaining
employers
share
the
cost
of
plan
stability
as
well,
because
the
multi-employer
act
provides
for
faster
funding,
necessitating
higher
contributions
from
those
who
continue
to
participate
and
contribute
to
multi-employer
plans.
covered
plans
in
general
shoulder
the
additional
burdens
of
higher
premiums
which
are
phased
in
from
a
50
cent
per
employee
premium
to
$2.60,
and
as
one
court
put
it,
congress
spread
the
pain
around.
now,
the
rationality
of
retroactivity
here
is
further
supported--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--that
is
correct.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
i
don't
apologize
for
it,
justice
blackmun.
i
know
that
that
is
precisely
how
it
is
described
by
appellee
and
his
nine
amici.
we
submit
that
it
was
not
political
pressure,
but
it
was
a
realization
as
described
by
senator
bentsen
on
april
29th
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
it
was
an
attempt,
a
realization,
rather,
that
it
had
done
much
of
its
work
already
retroactively.
retroactivity
is
part
of
the
original
package,
was
february
27,
1979.
between
february
27,
1979,
and
april
28th,
1980,
congress
concluded
that
retroactivity
had
done
its
job.
in
addition,
it
underscores
the
rationality
of
congress's
decision,
because
congress
took
into
consideration
the
fact
that
some
employers
had
embarked
on
a
course
of
action
prior
to
february
27th
which
would
lead
to
their
ultimate
withdrawal,
and
congress
took
that
fairness
factor
into
consideration,
concluding
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
retroactively
attach
liability
to
employers
who
even
before
this
package
was
submitted
to
congress
and
recommendations
were
submitted
to
congress,
that
it
would
be
unfair
for
them
to
have
retroactive
liability
attached
to
them.
now,
there
is
some
language
with
regard
to
political
pressure.
there
were
some
grumblings
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
senators
to
that
effect,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
two
realities
i
indicated
before
are
the
real
reasons
for
the
advancement
of
the
date.
now,
i
would
like
to
dwell,
if
i
may,
justice
blackmun,
a
little
bit
more
on
this
historical
context,
because
we
submit
that
it
does
support
the
rationality
of
what
congress
did
here.
if
one
message
came
through
loud
and
clear
when
erisa
was
passed
in
1974,
it
was
that
employers
involved
in
defined
benefit
plans
were
responsible
for
the
funding
of
those
plans.
no
longer
could
employers
walk
away
scott
free,
as
senator
matsunaga
put
it,
leaving
other
employers
holding
the
bag
even
where
they
had
contractually
limited
their
liability
to
specified
contributions.
now,
the
full
extension
of
this
principle
to
the
multi-employer
plan
world
was
delayed
by
the
congress
in
order
to
allow
thorough
analysis
of
the
special
problems
which
are
inherent
in
such
plans,
and
therefore
beginning
in
1977,
congress
passed
legislation
on
four
different
occasions
which
delayed
the
full
implementation
of
the
existing
program
to
multi-employer
contributing
employers,
alerting
those
employers
that
changes
in
the
existing
program
should
be
anticipated,
and
therefore
even
before
withdrawal
liability
and
its
retroactive
feature
were
considered
by
the
congress
for
a
17-month
period,
employers
in
this
heavily
regulated
industry,
in
this
heavily
regulated
area,
were
given
a
full
opportunity
to
know
that
congress
was
examining
alternative
legislative
solutions
to
the
problem
of
multi-employer
plans'
instability.
now,
once
the
legislative
process
began,
we
submit,
employers
were
then
on
further
notice
that
congress
was
strongly
considering
changing
their
contingent
liability
under
the
old
statute
to
a
fixed
liability,
and
that
congress
was
considering
specifically
making
that
liability
retroactive.
therefore,
against
this
backdrop
of
six
years
of
regulation
under
erisa,
of
17
months
of
considering
the
multi-employer
act,
and
given
what
we
submit
was
the
inexorability
of
the
legislative
process
by
april
29th,
1980,
at
a
point
when
three
congressional
committees
had
already
approved
identical
legislation
and
a
fourth
committee
headed
by
senator
bentsen,
who
took
the
floor
and
said,
we
need
a
little
bit
more
time
to
approve
it,
given
all
this
historical
context,
withdrawing
employers
were
in
a
position
to
know
at
least
that
they
could
no
longer
shift
their
responsibilities
to
remaining
employers.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
this
argument
is
made
last.
it
is
not
critical
to
winning
our
case.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
i
shall
move
from
it
immediately.
we
suspect...
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history,
given
this
legislative
history,
given
the
considerations
of
congress
in
terms
of
the
need
to
remove
incentives,
that
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
turner
elkhorn,
where
the
court
sustained
a
wholly
new
and
unanticipated
liability.
from
turner
elkhorn's
perspective,
the
transaction
which
generated
its
liability
was
entirely
closed.
indeed,
as
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
turner
elkhorn,
the
employment
relationship
in
some
instances
in
that
case
had
ceased
50
years
earlier,
notwithstanding
which
liability
was
attached
to
turner
elkhorn.
now,
the
court
below
rejected
the
turner
elkhorn
standard.
it
relied
instead
on
a
contracts
clause
case,
allied
structural
steel
versus
spanous,
on
a
1935
decision
in
railroad
retirement
board
versus
alton,
and
the
latter
case's
continued
vitality
was
questioned
by
this
court
in
turner
elkhorn.
first,
with
regard
to
allied,
if
i
may
for
a
few
minutes,
it
is
clear
that
the
contracts
clause
by
its
terms
is
limited
to
state
impairment
of
contract,
but
even
if
the
contract's
clause
were
somehow
made
applicable,
its
principles
were
somehow
imported
into
a
due
process
analysis,
as
the
court
below
has
suggested,
we
submit
that
allied
is
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar.
the
lynch
pin
of
the
court's
decision
in
allied
was
that
the
minnesota
statute
there
created
new
rights
where
none
had
existed
before,
and
in
addition,
in
the
energy
reserves
decision
which
came
down
last
term,
it
was
clear
that
the
court
narrowed
the
applicability
of
allied,
because
allied
was
entering...
minnesota
was
entering
an
area
it
had
never
before
sought
to
regulate.
under
these
circumstances
and
under
similar
circumstances
described
in
our
brief,
we
submit
that
allied
is
completely
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar,
and
similarly,
the
alton
railroad
decision
created
a
new
pension
scheme
for
railroad
employees
again
where
none
had
existed
before.
here,
the
expectations
of
the
receipt
of
vested
benefits
is
unmistakable.
and
finally,
appellees
place
their
principal
reliance
on
a
1928
decision
in
untermeyer
versus
anderson.
we
believe
that
that
reliance
is
misplaced.
there,
as
the
court
knows,
the
court
invalidated
a
retroactive
gift
tax,
but
as
explained
in
welch
versus
henry,
there
was
no
warning
that
such
a
tax
would
be
imposed.
here,
as
three
courts
of
appeals
and
as
numerous
district
courts
have
held,
notice
was
everywhere.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
the
trustees
can
use
the
money
to
pay
benefits.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct,
but
there
are
some
internal
restraints
upon
the
trustees
from
doing
so.
a
responsible
trustee
with
fiduciary
obligations
to
his
trust
will
be
concerned
about
creating
additional
unfunded
vested
liabilities
and
discouraging
new
employers
from
joining
his
trust.
if
the
trustees
act
in
a
profligate
manner,
they
will
essentially
destroy
the
trust
to
which
they
owe
a
fiduciary
obligation
and
the
participants'
reliance
on
it.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
if
there
are
no
unfunded
vested
liabilities,
then
there
is
no
withdrawal
liability.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
well,
the
problem,
your
honor,
and
of
course
this
is--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--that's
the
answer,
and
that's
precisely
why
congress
had
to
legislate
the
complex
statute
that
it
did.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
that
is
correct.
the
multi-employer--
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
--congress
was
not
in
a
position
of
legislating
on
the
basis
of
need,
that
kind
of
a
bright
line,
precisely
because
of
what
you
have
pointed
out,
justice
white,
and
that
is
the
difficulty
of
defining
where
need
begins
and
where
it
ends.
we
are
dealing
with
actuarial
guesses,
actuarial
guestimates,
actuarial
science
or
art,
depending
upon
one's
perspective.
and
the
precise
amount
of
money
that
is
needed
in
terms
of
funding
benefits
in
the
future
is
extremely
complex
and
extremely
difficult
to
prognosticate,
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
the
pike
case,
congress
need
not
wait
until
a
crisis
emerges
before
it
legislates,
and
that
is
precisely
what
occurred
here.
mr.

that
is
correct.
mr.

that
is
not
a

mr.

that
is
correct.
there
are
all
sorts
of
withdrawals.
they
are
treated
alike.
but
i
would
suspect
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
that
especially
in
a
collective
bargaining
context,
if
benefits
are
going
to
be
set
as
in
fact
the
arrangement
was
in
amex
coal,
if
benefits
are
going
to
be
set
in
the
context
of
collective
bargaining,
i
would
suspect
that
they
will
be
set
low
rather
than
high,
because
that
is
precisely
the
context
in
which
the
primary
concerns
are
often
with
continuing
employees,
with
active
employees,
with
wages,
and
the
primary
concerns
would
be
to
keep
those
benefits
if
they
are
set
in
a
collective
bargaining
context
at
a
lower,
more
reasonable,
if
you
will,
level.
and
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
i
would
suspect
the
trustees
would
be
more
likely
to
err
on
the
side
of
their
fiduciary
obligations
to
participants
than
would
the
collective
bargaining
context,
the
participants
in
the
collective
bargaining
context.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
baruch
a.
fellner
we
waive
rebuttal,
unless
there
are
any
questions.
