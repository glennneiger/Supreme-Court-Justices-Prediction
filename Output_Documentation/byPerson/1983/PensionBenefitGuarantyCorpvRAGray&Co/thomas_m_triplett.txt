mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
start
by
responding
to
the
questions
that
were
put
to
mr.
fellner.
one
was
whether
these
trusts
are
free
to
use
the
money
that
they
receive
from
payments
on
withdrawal
liability
for
any
purpose.
they
are
indeed
free
to
do
so.
in
fact,
it
is
probably
part
of
their
fiduciary
responsibility
to
utilize
them
to
enhance
benefits
as
opposed
to
reduce
withdrawal
liability.
withdrawal
liability
is
the
obligation
of
a
withdrawing
employer.
the
moneys
that
are
received
by
the
trust
are
intended
to
be
earmarked
for
the
benefit
of
the
beneficiary,
and
the
larger
the
pool
of
money,
the
greater
the
benefits
that
can
be
produced.
these
trusts,
particularly
the
one
that
is
before
the
court
today,
make
their
own
determinations
independent
of
any
third
party
as
to
what
level
of
benefits
they
will
sustain.
they
are
not
collectively
bargained.
the
only
thing
that
was
bargained
in
this
case
was
a
rate
contribution,
and
the
only
thing
that
was
bargained
was
the
corresponding
promise
that
that
is
our
sole
responsibility
in
entering
into
a
trust
arrangement.
another
question
that
was
put
was,
could
congress
have
based
its
actions
upon
the
specific
needs
of
trusts.
in
other
words,
counsel
concedes
that
not
all
trusts
are
in
trouble.
in
fact,
the
1978
report
of
pbgc
indicates
that
no
more
than
2
percent
of
the
trusts
in
this
country
are
in
financial
difficulty,
serious
financial
difficulty
that
might
lead
ultimately,
if
corrective
actions
were
not
taken--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--apparently
pbgc
had
this
information
based
on
reporting
forms
that
were
filed
with
it
pursuant
to
the
1974
act.
each
of
the
trusts
are
required
to
file
reports
on
an
annual
basis--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--i
think
that's
right.
in
fact,
in
this
very
legislation
there
is
a
provision
that
applies
to
some
segment
of
the
trucking
industry,
and
what
it
provides
is
that
when
an
employer
withdraws
from
a
trust,
pbgc
will
determine
whether
the
withdrawal
of
that
specific
employer
impairs
the
contribution
base
of
the
trust.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
actuaries
are
also
obligated
to
forecast
the
population
of
the
trusts,
and
they
do
this
on
an
annual
basis,
and
on
an
annual
basis
they
prepare
reports
based
on
the
contribution
base
and
the
number
of
employers
and
then
project
the
cash
flow
needs
of
the
trust
on
a
year
by
year
basis.
what
i
was
saying
about
the
exception
that
relates
to
a
portion
of
the
teamster
trust
is
that
the
mechanism
that
was
permitted
there
is
for
pbgc
to
make
a
determination
at
the
time
of
withdrawal
as
to
whether
the
withdrawing
employer
had
materially
injured
the
contribution
base
of
the
trust.
if
it
determined
that,
then
withdrawal
liability
was
imposed.
if
it
did
not
make
that
determination,
then
the
law
provided
that
a
bond
would
be
put
up
by
the
employer
in
the
amount
of
50
percent
of
the
potential
withdrawal
liability.
if
at
the
end
of
five
years
or
prior
to
that
time
pbgc
determined
that
there
had
been
an
impairment
to
the
contribution
base
of
the
trust,
then
it
would
impose
withdrawal
liability.
if
at
the
conclusion
of
five
years
there
was
indeed
no
impairment,
then
the
bond
was
exonerated.
so,
indeed,
there
is
a
fashion
by
which
congress
could
have
acted
to
limit
this
law
to
those
trusts
that
required
specific
attention
and
where
withdrawal
was
indeed
a
problem.
pbgc's
basic
argument
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
adequate
public
notice
of
the
pendency
of
the
act
and
its
possible
retroactive
application.
secondly,
it
urges
that
april
29
was
a
rationally
chosen
date
to
underscore
the
proposal
to
eliminate
opportunists'
withdrawal.
on
those
two
grounds,
it
concludes
that
due
process
has
been
satisfied.
this
argument
proceeds
on
some
false
fact
assumptions.
first,
was
april
29
chosen
in
order
to
avoid
opportunists'
withdrawal?
i
think
the
answer
is
quite
clear
from
the
congressional
record
that
it
was
not.
senator
javits
on
july
29,
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
stated
that
the
reason
that
that
date
was
chosen
was
to
favor
certain
employers
who
had
already
withdrawn,
that
it
was
not
chosen
to
further
the
goal
of
preventing
opportunistic
withdrawal.
secondly,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
there
was
a
massive
amount
of
public
notice,
and
therefore
in
perhaps
a
procedural
due
process
type
of
way,
we
were
sufficiently
alert
to
the
prospect
of
retroactive
application,
that
it
indeed
is
fair
to
apply
this
law
to
us.
we
terminated
on
june
1.
in
fact,
there
wasn't
adequate
public
notice.
senator
armstrong,
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
on
july
29,
commented,
and
i
quote:
"i
wish
only
to
make
a
simple
point.
"
"the
u.s.
senate
can
ill
afford
to
legislate
in
this
sloppy
manner.
"
"no
bill
for
markup,
no
committee
report,
no
three-day
rule
for
senators
to
consider
this
legislation.
"
"we
are
constantly
told,
let
staff
handle
this,
or
staff
will
study
this
and
work
out
the
details.
"
"well,
i
am
very
happy
that
we
have
such
an
able
staff
working
on
this
bill.
"
"it
is
a
shame
that
they
cannot
vote
for
it
or
against
it,
because
they
are
about
the
only
ones
who
know
what
is
in
it.
"
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
point
that
i
am
making
is,
we
urge
this
court
that
there
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue
involved
in
applying
a
statute
retroactively,
and
that
indeed,
that
under
our
concept
of
due
process,
the
employer
here
was
entitled
to
reasonable
notice
of
a
change
in
the
law,
and
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
adjust
his
conduct
to
what
that
law
would
be.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
certainly
the
untermeyer
case
is
an
instance
in
which
this
court
found
that
application
of
a
law
retroactively
violated
due
process
standards.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
it
has
been
cited
with
approval
since.
it,
i
think,
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
notwithstanding
the
pendency
of
legislation,
that
a
person
may
conduct
their
activities
in
disregard
of
the
pendency
of
that
legislation,
and
that
they
will
not
be
bound
for
the...
with
respect
to
a
closed
transaction
by
a
law
passed
subsequently.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
the
income
tax
cases
appear
to
me
to
be
unique.
the
derismont
case
that
this
court
decided
did
indeed
permit
for
income
tax
purposes
a
retroactive
application.
in
reaching
that
decision,
the
court
appears
to
have
stressed
the
fact
that
on
income
tax
matters
historically
they
have
been
made
retroactive.
it
stressed
the
fact
that
this
was
an
income
matter,
a
public
fisk
matter,
and
clearly
had
the
public
well-being
in
mind.
but
if
you...
every
single
gift
tax
case
has
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
because
they
are
dealing
with
closed
transactions.
if
there
is
an
articulated
basis
between
gift
tax
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
the
income
tax
cases
on
the
other,
the
thesis
is
that
a
man
will
continue
to
earn
an
income,
but
that
a
person
might
not
make
a
gift.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
but
i
don't
think
those
acts
have
been
upheld
where
they
have
applied
retroactively
to
a
transaction
which
has
already
been
concluded.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
all
right.
turner
elkhorn--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--turner
elkhorn,
i
think,
is
a
completely
different
kind
of
case.
turner
elkhorn
starts
with--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--turner
elkhorn
did
a
couple
of
things
which
this
law
does
not
do.
and
it
has
underpinnings
which
are
different.
i
think
you
start
off
with
the
premise
in
turner
elkhorn
that
the
employer
contributed
to
the
illness
of
its
employees,
the
sole
and
complete
control
of
the
work
place.
it
was
known
that
these
employees
were
becoming
ill
because
of
the
conditions
the
employer
created.
it
was
therefore
felt
not
unfair
with
this
knowledge,
that
they
were
profiting
on
the
illness
of
their
employees,
to
impose
this
rule
of
law.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
well--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--what
is,
what
is
the
basics
of
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause?
and
we
have
debated
among
ourselves
and
tried
to
fathom
a
standard.
we
come
down
to
the
simple
phrase,
"fundamental
fairness".
and
in
the
elkhorn
case,
indeed,
fairness
was
present
because
of
the
employer's
activities
or
lack
of
activities
that
were
involved
there.
secondly,
there
was...
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
there
are
people
here
who
are
likely
to
make
that
argument.
it
isn't
necessary
for
a
resolution
of
this
case,
because
we
aren't
here
dealing
with
closed
transactions.
but
indeed
if
the
touchstone
of
the
employer's
rights
are
his
expectations
that
arose
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
he
signed--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--yes.
then
indeed
it
could
be
a
logical
conclusion
that
an
employer
who
terminates
subsequent
in
time
but
within
the
same
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
be
similarly
circumscribed,
and
that
only
employers
who
signed
a
new
agreement
after
the
effective
date
would
be
held
to
the
standard
of
withdrawal.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
i
suppose
that
it
does,
although
the
employer...
maybe
the
best
way
of
approaching
that
problem
is
to
look
at
the
specific
facts
here.
this
employer
withdrew
because
it
could
not
reach
agreement
with
the
union
for
a
renewal
contract.
the
issues
that
were
involved
were
irradiation
from
this
court's
wilkie
romero
decision.
my
client
is
a
general
contractor,
and
it
was
seeking
freedom
to
subcontract
to
whomever
it
chose,
and
secondly,
he
was
quarreling
with
the
union
security
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
those
are
the
two
issues
that
held
the
parties
apart.
now,
had
it
known
that
indeed
a
massive
liability
would
be
imposed,
it
certainly
would
have
had
to
reconsider
whether
to
remain
at
impasse
on
the
two
issues
which
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
a
pension.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
i
am
not
certain
that
i
understood
your
question.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
no
question.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
no.
i
would
like
to,
but
we
haven't.
it
has
changed...
this
statute
has
changed
the
entire
chemistry
of
the
collective
bargaining
table,
and
has
placed
tools
in
the
hands
of
the
labor
side
of
the
table
which
make
renewal
agreements
very
difficult.
it
has
also
with
respect
to
new
employers
made
signing
up
new
employers
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
contains
a
pension
almost
impossible.
none
of
them
want
a
part
of
what
pbgc
and
congress
have
wrought.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
no,
this
is
because
of
prospective
withdrawal
liability.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
in
terms
of
this
notice
question,
this
question
which
i
view
as
a
question
of
fundamental
fairness,
pbgc
itself
acknowledged
the
inability
of
certain
employers
to
understand
the
effects
of
this
law,
even
though
it
had
already
been
passed.
in
47
fr
34662,
pbgc
granted
a
class
exemption
to
certain
employers
who
entered
into
a
transaction
a
day
or
two
after
september
26th,
and
it
did
so
because,
in
its
words,
sales
had
occurred
at
a
time
when
parties
either
did
not
know
or
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
know
that
sales
transactions
could
be
structured
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
immediate
withdrawal
liability.
pbgc
acknowledges
that
the
complexities
of
this
act
were
such
that
even
for
employers
who
withdrew
after
its
effective
date,
perhaps
some
exceptions,
are
proper.
now,
i
have
looked
at
the
various
cases
that
seem
to
control
the
disposition
of
this
case
here.
the
usury
case
is
obviously
a
critical
case
in
reaching
a
proper
resolution.
i
think
it
is
important
in
looking
at
the
usury
case
to
bear
a
few
salient
differences
in
mind,
because
i
think
it
bears
on
this
fundamental
fairness
concept
that
i
have
been
talking
about.
congress
chose
not
to
impose
liability
immediately
upon
employers.
rather,
congress
granted
a
two
and
a
half
year
moratorium,
and
during
that
period
of
time
the
federal
government,
not
the
employer,
would
pay
the
black
lung
claims.
thus,
the
employer
was
given
lead
time
after
congressional
notice
of
liability
to
adjust
its
affairs
to
deal
with
the
imposition
of
this
liability.
the
other
thing
which
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
is,
the
employer
in
those
cases
has
the
right
to
go
to
hearing
to
contest
whether
the
employee
had
in
fact
been
harmed,
whether
he
had
black
lung
disease.
and
so
in
that
case
it
was
incumbent
in
order
to
recover
that
it
be
demonstrated
that
this
employee
was
harmed
in
his
relationship
with
this
employer.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
is
important?
because
this
law,
this
1980
act,
does
not
depend
upon
whether
the
trust
has
been
harmed
by
the
withdrawal
of
an
employer.
in
fact,
it
may
be
a
windfall.
let
me
give
you
an
example
of
that.
in...
assume
an
employer
who
for
five
years
is
covered
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
he
is
required
to
make
contributions
to
a
trust.
at
the
expiration
of
five
years,
his
employees
decertify
the
union.
now,
under
that
example,
none
of
the
employees
would
have
vested.
ten-year
vesting
is
required.
none
of
those
employees
are
taxed
upon
the
fund.
and
yet
that
employer
would
be
required
not
merely
to
have
made
his
five
years
of
contributions,
but
a
withdrawal
liability
payment
as
well.
and
the
payments
are
not,
as
counsel
would
suggest,
so
modest
because
they
are
paid
over
time
as
not
to
have
a
terrifying
impact
upon
employers.
bear
in
mind
that
this
law--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--yes.
and
part
of
the
problem
of
the
windfall
is
noted
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
in
which
we
represented
to
this
court
that
two
years
after
we
withdrew,
the
trust
had
paid
all
of
its
unfunded
liabilities.
it
had
none.
the
trust
has
our
money,
but
the
trust
is
fully
paid.
now,
if
indeed
there
is
an
implied
condition
within
this
statute
that
states
that
we
are
entitled
to
our
money
back,
then
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case
is
moot,
but
if
indeed
there
is
no
such
implied
condition,
it
demonstrates
the
massive
unfairness
of
the
rules.
i
think
that
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
question
of
retroactive
liability
that
this
court
has
come
perilously
close
to
adopting
a
contract
clause
type
of
analysis
for
legislation
which
deals
with
closed
transactions.
it
has
never
held
that
the
two
are
synonymous,
but
in
attempting
to
distill
the
principles
that
appear
to
have
been
applied,
they
appear
to
closely
parallel
one
another.
i
think
that
not
surprising
since
under
the
contract
clause
what
you
are
doing
is
disrupting
a
prior
transaction.
and
in
consequence,
it
would
appear
to
me
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
the
analysis
with
respect
to
closed
transactions
should
be
the
same.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
analytical
tools
that
underscore
a
contract
clause
analysis
apply
equally
to
a
fifth
amendment
analysis
with
respect
to
retroactive
application
to
a
closed
transaction.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
restraint
with
respect
to
the
language
of
the
constitution
when
it
is
borne
in
mind
that
when
originally
written
it
was
thought
that
only
the
states
would
be
in
the
business
of
regulating
contracts,
and
secondly--
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
--but
they
did
subsequently
enact
the
amendments,
and
the
fifth
amendment,
and
what
indeed
does
that
due
process
concept
mean?
i
have
difficulty
in
my
own
mind
believing
that
the
founding
fathers
felt
that
a
greater
restraint
should
be
imposed
on
the
states
than
on
the
federal
entity.
mr.
thomas
m.
triplett
well,
this
court
in
the
spanouse
case
dealt
with
a
contract
clause
issue.
i
think
that
if
you
look
to
the
usury
case
and
the
types
of
things
which
were
considered
important
in
reaching
the
conclusion
there,
and
you
look
to
the
spanouse
decision
and
the
types
of
things
which
were
considered
important
to
the
conclusion
in
that
case,
that
you
come
out
with
a
litmus
test
that
is
the
same.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions,
thank
you.
