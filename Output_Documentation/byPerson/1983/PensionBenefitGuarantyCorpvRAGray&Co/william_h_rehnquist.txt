justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
that
is
a
very
good
reason
for
bearing
it
in
mind.
if
the
framers
thought
that
only
the
states
are
going
to
be
in
the
business
of
regulating
contracts,
and
therefore
will
apply
this
prohibition
to
them
and
not
to
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
later
gets
a
lot
more
active
and
bigger,
surely
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
simply
say,
well,
i
think
the
framers
would
have
wanted
this
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
if
they
had
only
known
how
big
it
was
going
to
get,
so
we
as
judges
will
apply
it.
