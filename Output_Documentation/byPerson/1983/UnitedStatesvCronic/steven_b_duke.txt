mr.
steven
b.
duke
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
its
main
brief
in
this
case,
the
government
argues
that
this
was
a
case
of
unimpaired
counsel
and
that
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
appropriate
test
for
relief
of
an
unimpaired
counsel.
now
mr.
kneedler
concedes
the
decision
below
was
based
on
quite
different
considerations,
namely
judicial
impairments
in
counsel's
ability
to
prepare
and
present
the
case,
and
that
is
the
case,
that
is
the
decision
below,
and
that
is
the
case
before
this
court.
of
course,
powell
against
alabama
is
distinguishable.
but
the
basic
principle
of
powell
against
alabama
applies
in
this
case.
the
court
in
powell
said
that
the
court's
obligation
to
appoint
counsel
is
not
discharged
by
a
formal
appointment,
but
the
appointment
must
be
made
at
such
time
and
under
such
circumstances
as
will
enable
the
giving
of
effective
aid
in
the
preparation
and
the
trial
of
the
case.
that
obligation
was
not
discharged
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
colston--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--25
days
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
was
manifestly
not
enough.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
30
were?
no,
i
think
clearly
not.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
at
the
time
mr.
colston
asked
for
a
minimum
of
30,
he
knew
nothing,
virtually
nothing
about
the
case.
that
was
the
day
he
was
being
appointed
and
entering
his
appearance,
and
at
that
time
he
said:
your
honor,
i
need
a
minimum
of
30
days.
and
in
fact
he
was
cut
off
by
the
judge.
he
was
attempting
to
explain
his
need
and
the
judge
cut
him
off.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
did
not
ask
for
more
time.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
i
think...
well,
either
that
or
that
he
was
not
incompetent
in
concluding
that
the
judge
had
made
a
final
ruling
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
reconsider.
it
seems
to
me,
particularly
in
the
case
of
an
inexperienced
lawyer,
mr.
colston
might
well
have
concluded
that
the
judgment,
the
final
judgment
on
the
question
of
a
trial
date,
had
been
made.
and
indeed,
i
would
think
many
lawyers
would,
or
many
judges,
trial
judges,
would
be
surprised
if
on
the
day
of
trial
counsel
came
in
and
said,
your
honor,
i
need
a
week
more
to
prepare.
i
think
most
judges
would
be
incensed
if
counsel
came
in
on
the
day
of
trial
and
said--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--i
think
it
is--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--i
don't
think
it's
common
where
a
firm
date
has
been
set
and
it
is
in
a
district
or
in
a
courthouse
where
dates
mean
something
and
a
jury
pool
is
gathered
for
that
case.
for
example,
in
most
federal
courts
i
think
it
is
most
unusual
for
counsel
to
come
in
on
the
day
set
for
trial
and
get
a
continuance.
certainly,
i've
never
found
that
to
be
a
successful
motion.
now,
what
in
effect
the
trial
judge
did
was
impose
upon
the
defense
and
on
mr.
colston
particularly
the
obligation
of
in
25
days
learning
the
rules
of
evidence,
learning
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
learning
the
principles
of
criminal
law,
learning
how
to
try
a
case,
understanding
thousands
of
documents,
fitting
those
documents
into
the
framework
of
a
defense,
and
interviewing
or
attempting
to
interview
two
dozen
witnesses
that
were
scattered
throughout
the
southern
states.
and
to
do
that--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--justice
o'connor,
that
is
partially
correct.
mr.
rivas
was
appointed
as
an
investigator,
for
which
he
received...
submitted
an
invoice
for
$300,
for
which
he
was
paid.
that
was
the
nature
of
mr.
rivas'
obligation
to
the
court.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
have
no
reason
to
dispute
what
is
in
his
affidavit,
that
he
had
substantial
criminal
experience.
there
is
nothing
in
his
affidavit
to
suggest
that
he
ever
tried
a
federal
case,
civil
or
criminal.
all
of
the
experience
that
he
mentions
is
state
court
experience.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
the
respondent's
statement
on
june
19th
to
the
court
saying:
your
honor,
i've
just
been
informed
by
mr.
colston
that
this
is
his
second
experience
in
a
federal
case.
and
then
mr.
colston
when
he
read
his
opening
argument
to
the
jury
said,
this
is
my
first
trial.
if
he
was
telling
the
truth,
that
means
it
was
his
first
trial
of
any
kind
in
any
court.
so
mr.
colston
had
these
burdens,
which
i
submit
were
impossible
even
if
a
fact
which--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--no,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
a
lawyer
who
has
never
tried
a
case
doesn't
try
a
complicated
mail
fraud
case
involving
thousands
of
documents,
a
15-page
indictment,
24
witnesses,
and
do
all
of
that
in
25
days.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
a
lawyer...
certainly
a
lawyer
has
to
try
his
first
case,
and
i
would
think
trying
misdemeanors
would
be
the
appropriate
place
to
start
if
the
beginning
is
in
the
criminal
process.
but
prosecutors
don't
turn...
don't
hire
a
lawyer
and
put
them
in
a
complicated
mail
fraud
prosecution.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
think
that
we
do
not
contend
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
appoint
inexperienced
lawyers,
even
in
felony
cases.
but
if
a
judge...
i
think
that
is
undesirable.
it's
a
bad
practice.
if
a
judge
is
going
to
do
that,
it
is
possible
to
bring
an
inexperienced
lawyer
along,
to
supervise
that
lawyer,
and
in
a
relatively
simple
case
obtain
a
reasonably
competent
presentation.
one
thing
that
may
be
important,
that
is
important,
is
look
at
the
lawyer's
training.
a
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
take
evidence,
a
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
take
criminal
law,
a
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
take
criminal
procedure
in
order
to
be
a
lawyer.
he
doesn't
have
to
attend
any
training
courses.
so
in
determining
the
appropriate
lawyer
to
appoint
on
a
case,
the
court
should
take
into
account
precisely
the
factors
that
the
court
below
said
should
be
taken
into
account.
and
incidentally--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--no.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
think
most
of
them,
probably
all
of
them,
are
required
to
teach
it.
but
no
student
is
required
by
the
american
bar
association
to
take
the
course.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
in
some
law
schools
it
is
not
a
required
course,
not
in
my
law
school.
evidence
is
not
required
in
my
law
school.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
not
a
defendant.
this
defendant,
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case,
had
a
constitutional
right
to
a
more
experienced
attorney
or
more
time
to
prepare
and
such
supervision
as
was
necessary
to
make
a
real
lawyer
out
of
a
real
estate
lawyer.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
that
could
have
been
done.
i'm
just
saying
that
there
is
no...
we're
not
asking
for
any
absolute
ruling.
the
court
below
said,
we're
not
holding
that
inexperience
is
necessarily
ineffective,
even
in
a
mail
fraud
case.
but
when
you
combine
the
inexperience,
the
complexity
of
the
case,
the
seriousness
of
the
case,
and
the
total
lack
of
supervision,
you
have
something
that
is
fundamentally
unfair.
you
have
a
virtual
guarantee
of
inadequate
preparation
and
presentation.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i
do
think
i
rather
preferred
the
dissent
in
that
case,
but
the
distinguishing
factor
about
faretta
is
free
choice.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
there
was
no
free
choice
in
this
case.
now,
incidentally,
i'd
like
to
focus
a
little
bit
on
what
the
trial
judge
did
wrong,
because
that
ultimately
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
below.
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief:
"a
trial
court
should
assure
itself
that
the
attorney
assigned
to
represent
a
defendant
is
capable
of
doing
so.
"
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
i
think
that
is
the
fair
reading
of
this
opinion,
is
that
this
was
judicial
error.
this
is
not
a
case
of
finding
ineffective
assistance
in
the
usual
sense.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
on
my
first
point,
point
one
of
my
brief,
yes.
however,
both
issues
were
argued
below.
they
were
divided
into
two
arguments:
one,
that
the
defense
should
have
had
more
time
to
prepare;
and
two,
that
counsel
was
ineffective,
and
the
essence
of
the
argument
about
ineffectiveness
was
that
counsel
was
pervasively
incompetent.
what
the
court
below
apparently
did
is
combine
these
two,
and
it
presumably
read
the
record.
it
heard
the
arguments
on
both
sides
on
both
issues
and
concluded
there
was
inadequate
representation.
but
my
point
is
that
the
inadequate
representation
that
the
court
found
was
the
result
of
impairments
imposed
on
the
defense
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
ineffective
in
the
powell
against
alabama
sense.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
wisdom
of
the
approach
of
the
court
below
is
the
holloway
against
arkansas
wisdom,
that
where
a
defense
is
substantially
impaired,
as
in
your
example
appointing
an
inexperienced
attorney
in
a
complex
case
and
giving
him
four
days,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
ineffective
assistance
to
look
at
the
trial
record
and
conclude,
boy,
he
really
looked
good,
he
knew
how
to
ask
questions
and
he
knew
how
to
object
to
questions.
that
doesn't
tell
you
much.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
where
the
judge
has
created,
as
in
this
case
over
numerous
objections,
the
impairments,
then
the
question
before
the
court
is:
did
these
impairments
unfairly
undermine
the
defense's
opportunity
to
prepare
and
present
the
defense?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
the
record
cannot
show
that
he
tried
the
case
flawlessly.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
no.
the
record
can
show
that
he
knew
how
to
ask
questions,
and
that
he
knew
some
of
the
rules
of
evidence,
and
that
he
was
articulate.
it
can't
show
whether
he
presented
the
right
defense.
it
can't
show
whether
he
ignored
a
much
better
defense.
it
can't
show
his
failures
to
prepare,
as
in
the
conflict
of
interest
case.
the
burdens
if
inadequate
time
and
inadequate
experience
and
knowledge
force
the
lawyer
not
to
do
a
lot
of
things
that
a
lawyer
ought
to
do.
and
a
look
at
the
trial
record
will
not
tell
you
whether
he
did
them
or
he
didn't
do
them.
a
look
at
this
record
establishes
quite
conclusively,
i
submit,
that
many
of
the
basic
functions
that
are
expected
of
a
lawyer
could
not
have
been
performed
by
mr.
colston
under
the
conditions
that
he
faced,
including
his
own
inexperience.
and
therefore,
some
fundamental
obligations
of
an
attorney,
that
we
expect
of
an
attorney,
were
not
performed
by
mr.
colston.
now,
the
court
below
had
the
trial
record.
it
had
the
argument
on
both
sides
as
to
the
performance
of
mr.
colston,
and
it
apparently
thought
that
what
it
saw
in
mr.
colston's
performance
either
confirmed
the
inferences
that
it
drew
from
the
circumstantial
evidence,
the
pretrial
burdens,
or
in
any
event
did
not
refute
it.
it
didn't
explain
which
of
those
particular
positions
it
took.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
couldn't
have
done
such
a
stupid
thing?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
a
mistake
is
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
but
this
case...
first
of
all.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
you
ask
the
lawyer
why?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
he
can
if
his
client
is
attacking
his
competence.
certainly
the
privilege
is
gone.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
and
he
can
say,
i
didn't
do
it
because
he
said
i'm
guilty.
i
don't
think
that
should
satisfy
the
court,
and
the
aba
is
quite
clear
that
what
your
client
tells
you
about
his
or
her
guilt
or
innocence
doesn't
discharge
your
obligation
to
investigate
the
case.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
it
certainly
will
do
that.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that's
true.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
no.
but
suppose
he
says,
i'm
guilty,
he
did
it,
but
there
are
three
witnesses
that
will
say
i
was
elsewhere.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
would
think
a
lawyer
could
say,
i'm
not
going
to
bother
with
those
witnesses
unless--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--well--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--well,
if
it's
a
case
of
identity,
perhaps.
but
in
many
cases
defendants
don't
know
whether
they're
guilty
or
not.
there
are
questions
of
mens
rea,
there
are
mitigating
factors,
there
are
questions
of
their
possible
defenses
that
can
be
raised.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
yes.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
it
did
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
as
i
have
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief,
what
was
done
in
this
case
is
not
that
different
from
what
major
corporations
and
banks
do.
the
arrangement
was
slightly
different,
but
what
the
respondent
attempted
to
do
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
float.
he
wanted
some
free
credit,
like...
in
other
words,
a
big
company
on
the
east
coast
and
the
west
coast
will
write
an
east
coast
check
for
west
coast
services.
the
respondent
had
expenses
in
florida
and,
instead
of
writing
an
oklahoma
check
for
those
expenses
he
accomplished
the
same
thing
by
writing
a
florida
check,
but
drawing
against
the
oklahoma
bank,
essentially
accomplishing
the
same
thing.
i
very
much
disagree
with
the
government
in
its
suggestion
that
there
was
not
a
viable
defense
in
this
case.
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
basic
facts.
interestingly
enough,
the
two
co-defendants
in
this
case
testified
for
the
prosecution
and
they
testified
to
all
these
banking
transactions
and
they
testified
to
the
fact
that
the
respondent
gave
the
orders
and
decided
what
was
going
to
be
done
and
so
forth.
neither
of
them
suggested
that
they
had
any
criminal
intent,
and
nothing
in
their
testimony
suggested
the
respondent
had
any
criminal
intent.
and
the
respondent's
behavior
after
the
overdraft
was
entirely
consistent
with
a
mistake.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
there
was
one
guilty
plea,
yes,
and
one
dismissal,
a
guilty
plea
following
probation.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
an
intent
at
least
to
deceive
in
a
material
way,
at
least
that
much.
and
there
was
no
deceit
concerning
the
floating
of
checks.
it
was
quite
obvious
that
the
tampa
bank
and
the
oklahoma
bank
were
being
used
to
float
checks,
quite
obvious
to
any
banker
that
looked
at
those
checks.
the
only
real
question,
the
only
possible
deception,
could
have
been
respondent's
deception
in
his
intention
to
make
good
on
these
checks,
and
on
that
issue
everything
he
did
following
the
overdraft
was
consistent
with
his
intent
to
make
good
on
the
checks.
he
did
make
good
on
the
checks.
he
turned
over
to
the
bank
a
business,
a
growing
business
with
20
employees,
that
the
bank
paid
$504,000
for
and
turned
around
and
sold
to
its
directors
for
$504,000.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
that
may
very
well
be,
justice
rehnquist.
on
the
other
hand,
the
amounts
of
the
checks
in
this
particular
case
were
very
large
indeed,
particularly
compared
to
the
size
of
the
bank.
i
mean,
this
company
was
one
of
the
bank's
major
customers
and
it
seems
unlikely
to
me
that
the
bank
was
entirely
unaware
of
the
volume
or
the
nature
of
the
checking
transactions.
and
what
the
bank
probably
or
apparently
decided
to
do
was
to
trust
that
it
wouldn't
get
hurt,
because
it
was
very
much
in
its
interests
to
have
these
transactions
going
through
the
bank.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
that
is
true.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
it
is
true
that
it's
different
in
that
obviously
more
checks
were
deposited
than
would
normally
be
deposited
in
a
typical
business.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
there
were
a
total
of
$5
million,
approximately,
deposited
over
a
period
of
five
or
six
months,
and
the
revenues
of
the
business
were
estimated
to
be...
one
witness
said
$30,000
a
month,
another
said
$150,000
a
year.
but
of
course,
that
was
the
one
business,
and
there
were
two
businesses.
a
second
business
was
acquired
during
the
latter
part
of
this
period.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
but
it
seems
to
me
respondent's
explanation
is
quite
credible.
what
he
was
doing
in
running
all
these
large
checks
through
was
impressing
the
bank
and
pleasing
the
bank,
because
that
helped
the
bank
increase
its
deposit
power.
so
he
was
acquiring
some
kind
of
a
reputation
with
the
bank
as
an
important
customer,
that
was
very
helpful
to
the
bank.
the
point
is
that
none
of
this
defense
was
mentioned
by
mr.
colston.
i'm
not
saying
this
was
a
defense
as
a
matter
of
law.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
victim
must
lose
money
in
order
for
there
to
be
mail
fraud.
i
am
suggesting
that
there
are
a
number
of
legal
principles
and
a
number
of
favorable
charges
to
the
jury
that
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
that
the
facts
were
very
supportive
of
a
defense
of
no
intent
to
defraud.
instead,
mr.
colston
made
a
defense
that
is
a
non-defense,
an
utterly
absurd
defense
that
if
mr.
cronic
did
not
write
the
checks
he
was
not
responsible.
i
don't
see
how
any
lawyer
that
took
criminal
law
could
make
that
argument.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
possibly,
possibly.
it
seems
to
me
not
to
give
the
jury
very
much
credit.
but
i
would...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
would
be
incompetent
behavior
if
there
was
no
defense
available.
if
the
lawyer
wants
to
try
to
bamboozle
the
jury
and
try
jury
nullification,
that's
quite
appropriate
where
there
is
no
defense.
but
here
there
was
a
very
viable,
strong
defense
that
was
apparently
never
even
recognized
by
mr.
colston.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
or
by
his
experienced
colleague.
now,
the
government
suggests
that
there
ought
to
be
a
hearing.
they
don't
want
a
remand.
they
want
mr.
cronic--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--which?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
about
the
remand?
mr.
steven
b.
duke
inadequate
defense--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--if
it
was
made,
it
was
made
mushily.
i
believe
it
was
made
by
the
respondent
in
the--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
it
was
made...
the
respondent
filed
a
pro
se
brief
in
which
he
predicated
upon
his
newly
discovered
evidence.
he
claimed--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--he
had
court-appointed
counsel
and
he
also
had
leave
to
file
his
own
brief
pro
se.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
i
can't
say.
i
really
don't
know
whether
counsel
below
really
focused
on--
mr.
steven
b.
duke
--yes.
what
is
not
clear
is
that
the
record
was
carefully
read
and
absorbed
by
court-appointed
counsel
below.
mr.
steven
b.
duke
well,
that
is
correct.
but
if
mr.
colston
had
interviewed
the
witnesses
or
seen
statements
of
the
witnesses,
either
one,
if
as
the
government
claims
they
had
turned
over
essentially
an
open
file,
he
would
have
seen
that
it
was
absolutely
hopeless
to
question
that
the
respondent
mr.
cronic
was
in
control
of
these
banking
transactions.
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
witnesses,
some
of
them
unimpeachable,
that
would
have
established
that
mr.
cronic
was
the
owner
of
these
companies
and
that
he
called
the
shots
and
that
ms.
cummings,
the
nominal
president,
was
in
fact
his
secretary.
if
he
had
simply
looked
at
the
statements,
he
would
have
known
that
what
he
set
forth
as
a
defense
was
tantamount
to
a
plea
of
guilty.
thank
you.
