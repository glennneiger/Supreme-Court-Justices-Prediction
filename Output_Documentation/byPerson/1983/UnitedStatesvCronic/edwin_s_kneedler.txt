mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
and
the
companion
case
of
strickland
versus
washington
concern
the
circumstances
under
which
an
otherwise
valid
judgment
of
conviction
may
be
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
asserted
defects
in
district
court
by
defense
counsel.
this
issue
is
one
of
substantial
importance
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
and
state
courts.
this
is
so
because
of
the
frequency
with
which
such
claims
are
raised
and
because
of
the
often
extended
proceedings
that
some
courts
have
ordered
to
dispose
of
those
claims.
all
too
often,
in
our
view,
the
courts
engaged
in
a
somewhat
detached
inquiry
into
the
litigating
judgments
and
performance
of
counsel
in
the
abstract,
rather
than
focusing
on
what
we
submit
should
be
the
central
concern,
that
is,
whether
any
errors
by
counsel
in
turn
prejudiced
the
accused
by
causing
a
fundamental
defect
in
the
proceedings.
in
order
to
obtain
relief
on
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel;
it
is
our
position
that
the
accused
must
show
errors
that
fall
below
the
minimum
level
of
competence
of
counsel;
and
second,
that
any
such
errors
in
turn
had
a
probable
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
case
or
otherwise
undermine
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
any
such
findings
in
reversing
the
respondent's
conviction
on
the
ground
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
in
fact,
it
did
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
principal
basis
of
the
claim
and
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
was
of
the
first
type
that
you
mentioned.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that,
in
effect,
that
it
must
be
conclusively
presumed
that
respondent's
attorney
colston
did
not
have...
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
prepare
for
trial
within
the
25
days
allowed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
was
the
principal
claim.
there
were
passing
allegations
of
inadequacies
in
the
actual
performance
of
counsel
as
well.
there
were
some
general
assertions
that
counsel
never
objected
to
any
evidence,
without
identifying
particular
objections.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
of
appeals
plainly
resolved
only
the
first,
because
the
court
noted
the
government's
objection
that
in
fact
respondent
had
not
identified
any
specific
failings
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
believe
it's
not
here
in
its
entirety,
largely
because
most
of
the
specific
failings
of
trial
counsel
that
respondent
points
to
were
never
identified
in
the
court
of
appeals,
even
though
there
was
a
claim
that
counsel
in
fact
had
performed
inadequately.
the
specificity
with
which
respondent
now
claims
was
just
not
reflected
in
the
record.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
as
to
the
second
type
it's
our
position
that
the
appropriate
procedure
would
be
for
respondent
to
raise
any
claims
about
specific
defects
in
counsel's
performance
in
a
motion
under
2255,
because
this
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
that
was,
i
think,
the
premise
of
the
question.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
allegations
of
specific
defects
be
raised
under
2255,
largely
because
they
are
often
thought,
and
usually
do,
arise
from
things
outside
the
record,
so
it
would
often
be
necessary
to
make
a
record,
and
in
any
event
to
have
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
to
take
an
assessment
of
the
impact
of
any
errors
by
counsel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
the
claim
can
be
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
record
created,
then
there
would
be
an
appropriate
occasion
to
dispose
of
the
case
in
that
instance.
but
if
it
would
require
an
extensive
hearing,
that's
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
ordinarily
be
part
of
a
direct
appeal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
there
were
specific
errors
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
dispose
of
by
assessing
the
record,
then
that
would
be
appropriate.
part
of
this
ties
into
our
submission
on
the
merits,
though,
as
well,
and
that
is
that
the
essential
part
of
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
not
counsel's
performance
in
the
abstract,
but
how
it
affects
the
conduct
of
the
trial
and
the
rights
of
the
accused.
and
so
what
the
court
would
be
doing
on
direct
appeal,
what
we
submit
it
should
be
doing,
is
determining
whether
the
errors
by
counsel
amounted
to
plain
error
of
the
type
that
would
warrant
relief
on
the
basis
of
those
errors
themselves,
without
regard
to
whether
counsel
had
caused
them
or
not.
so
on
direct
appeal,
if
counsel
is
said
to
have
committed
a
plain...
or
caused
a
plain
error
to
result--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
either
event
they--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
the
error
is
one
of
omission
the
record
may
provide
a
basis
for
disposing
of
that
and
it
may
not.
but
in
either
event,
whether
it's
an
act
of
commission
of
omission,
the
result
is
a
defect
in
the
proceedings,
which
we
submit
is
where
the
focus
should
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
burden
on
the
defense
counsel?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
submit
that
the
burden--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
no.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
no,
the
burden
is
on
the
convicted
defendant
to
establish
that
his
counsel
committed
errors
of
sufficient
seriousness
to
warrant
setting
aside
the
conviction.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
are
concerned
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
we
are
concerned
that
there
is
often
a
tendency
for
a
person
who
is
convicted
to
blame
the
conviction
on
the
lawyer,
and
we
think
that
and
a
variety
of
other
considerations
support
our
position
that
there
should
be
a
showing
of
a
substantial
defect
in
the
proceedings
in
order
to
get
relief
on
the
basis
of
the
lawyer's
performance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
powell
case,
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
and
this
comes
back
to
justice
o'connor's
position.
respondent
in
effect
tries
to
put
this
case
into
the
category
of
powell.
in
powell
the
court
did
set
aside
a
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
arising
out
of
the
circumstances
of
the
appointment
of
counsel,
without
bothering
to
inquire
into
how
counsel
actually
performed.
but
the
circumstances
of
powell
are
quite
different
from
those
here.
in
powell
the
lawyer
effectively
assumed
responsibility
for
the
case
on
the
day
of
trial,
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
counsel
was
precluded
from
consulting
with
his
clients
absolutely
and
was
precluded
from
conducting
an
investigation
of
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right,
initially.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
then
when
counsel
finally
did
assume
responsibility,
it
was
too
late
and
he
had
no
opportunity.
and
the
court
reiterated
this
point
in
avery
versus
alabama,
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
principle
of
powell
is
whether
the
attorney
had
an
opportunity
to
consult
and
prepare.
and
yet,
in
avery
the
court
rejected
a
powell-type
claim,
even
though
defense
counsel
had
only
three
days
to
prepare
a
capital
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
court
did
take
into
account
the
need
for
conducting
the
trial
promptly,
but
that
is
an
interest
that
exists
today.
congress'
judgment
under
the
speedy
trial
act
reflects
the
importance
of
bringing
cases
to
trial
promptly.
now,
granted
the
time
limits
are
much
longer
under
the
speedy
trial
act.
30
days
is
the
rule
between
arraignment
or
appearance
through
counsel
and
trial,
to
allow
counsel
to
prepare.
but
in
this
case,
this
case
does
not
even
remotely
resemble
powell
versus
alabama.
attorney
colston
was
tentatively
appointed
in
this
case
on
june
12th
and
finally
assumed
responsibility
for
the
case
on
june
19th,
1980.
at
that
point
the
trial
was
scheduled
to
be
held
eleven
days
later.
he
requested
a
continuance
to
allow
himself
30
days
to
prepare
for
the
trial.
the
court
granted
that
request
for
continuance,
but
cut
it,
what
the
court
said,
a
few
days
short,
five
days
short,
to
25
days,
in
order
to
fit
the
scheduling
of
the
case
into
the
court's
docket.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i
understand
respondent's
complaint,
that's
essentially
what
the
case
boils
down
to.
now,
he
also
argues
that
perhaps
even
more
than
30
days
was
required,
but
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
that
that's
so
and
neither
respondent
himself
nor
colston
renewed
a
request
for
continuance.
and
at
the
close
of
the
trial
the
trial
judge
commended
colston
on
the
quality
of
his
performance.
so
there's
just
no
basis
for
believing
that
the
difference
between
25
and
30
was
of
constitutional
significance,
let
alone
that
more
than
30
was
required.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
record
does
not
show.
martindale
hubbell
indicates,
i
think,
that
he
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar
five
years
previously,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
he
knew
that
he
was
not
a
competent
real
estate
lawyer?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
he
was
a
real
estate
lawyer--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
he
did
argue
that,
because
his
lawyer
did
not
have
prior
experience
in
criminal
cases,
that
that
was
a
factor
to
be
considered
under
what
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case
devised
to
be
a
five-part
balancing
test
in
which
experience
is
one.
but
even
in
this
court,
respondent
doesn't
contend
that
he
was
entitled
absolutely
to
a
lawyer
with
more
experience,
and
we
submit
that
that
concession
is
well
founded.
the
constitution
speaks
of
the
assistance
of
counsel,
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
framers
of
the
sixth
amendment
had
anything
in
mind
in
using
the
term
"counsel"
other
than
a
person
admitted
to
the
bar
and
admitted
to
practice
before
the
court,
as
colston
was.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
he
did
not,
and
when
the
trial
court
made
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
counsel
was
prepared
to
proceed
defense
counsel
pronounced
themselves
ready.
i
would
also
point
out
that
colston
was
not
alone
in
this
case.
there
was
another
attorney,
mr.
rivas,
who
appeared
with
him,
and
according
to
an
affidavit
filed
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
rivas
had
extensive
prior
experience
in
criminal
cases.
so
that
even
assuming
that
an
inexperienced
counsel
standing
alone
might
be
a
substantial
factor,
here,
to
the
extent
you
recognize
that
it
might
be
good
to
get
some
assistance,
he
in
fact
got
it
here.
now,
one
other
factor
respondent
does
mention
in
this
powell-type
argument
suggests
or
asserts
broadly
that
mail
fraud,
which
is
what
we
had
here,
is
an
arcane
and
complex
area
of
the
law.
but
that
generalization
simply
won't
stand
up.
there
are
simply
two
elements
to
the
offense:
one
is
the
existence
of
a
scheme
to
defraud;
and
the
other
is
the
use
of
the
mails
to
accomplish
the
scheme.
here
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
use
of
the
mails
in
the
scheme,
and
the
scheme
itself
was
a
simple
one.
it
involved
check-kiting,
which
this
court
described
in
simple
terms
just
two
terms
ago
in
williams
versus
united
states.
it
involves
the
defendant
taking
advantage
of
the
float
created
when
checks
are
sent
back
and
forth
from
one
bank
to
another.
the
mechanics
of
that
sort
of
scheme
would
not
be
difficult
for
any
attorney
or
anyone
who
maintains
a
checking
account
to
figure
out.
there
were
a
number
of
transactions
in
this
case,
but
they
were
part
of
one
overall
similar
course
of
conduct,
and
the
defense
counsel
had
available
to
him
the
full
records
in
the
case
and
in
fact
a
reconciliation
of
the
accounts
of
the
banks
by
his
company's
own
cpa
that
disclosed
that
the
bank
in
oklahoma
had
lost
a
half
a
million
dollars
or
that
there
was
a
net
overdraft
of
a
half
million
dollars.
respondent
does
not
dispute
any
of
those
facts
regarding
the
sending
of
checks
back
and
forth
or
the
net
overdraft
that
resulted,
and
he
concedes
in
his
brief
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
his
control
of
the
company
involved
and
that
he
directed
the
check-cashing
activities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
with
all
respect,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
defense
would
be
quite
far-fetched
in
these
circumstances,
largely
because
of...
or
in
part
because
of
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
government's
case.
but
the
business
involved
here...
there
was
testimony
at
trial
that
there
was
just
$150,000
a
year
annual
sales.
respondent's
co-defendant
testified
to
that.
she
was
his
secretary.
and
yet,
there
were
$5
million
deposited
in
the
two
accounts
over
a
period
of
four
months,
the
checks
going
back
and
forth
without
any,
even
to
this
day,
explanation
of
what
sort
of
legitimate
banking
practice
would
have
been
going
on.
i
think
in
these
circumstances
for
respondent
to
suggest
that
if
there
was
a
swindler
it
was
the
norman
bank
is
unfair.
and
in
fact,
although
respondent
contends
that
the
bank
ultimately
recovered
the
proceeds
and
that
there
was
no
fraud,
that's
also
beside
the
point.
first
of
all,
it's
not
necessary
that
a
scheme
to
defraud
be
successful
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
but
in
any
event,
the
facts
here
just
do
not
establish
that
the
bank
was
repaid,
much
less
that
it
was
repaid
voluntarily
by
respondent
in
a
way
that
could
refute
the
existence
of
criminal
intent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that's
true,
although
unless
they
in
turn
recovered
somebody
was
defrauded,
unless
the
assets--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
don't
know.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it
can't
be
said
on
the
face
of
this
record
that
there
was
in
our
view
anything
approaching
an
argument
that
this
was
a
substantial
avenue
of
defense
in
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
speaking
from
personal
experience,
i
simply
couldn't
say.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct,
although
a
real
estate
lawyer
could
have
litigation
experience.
it's
not
clear
from
this
record
whether
colston
had
prior
trial
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
what
colston
knew
or
what
he
didn't
know.
it
may
have
been
in
this
case
unnecessary
to
require
the
statements...
or
to
request
the
statements
under
the
jencks
act,
because
he
already
had
them.
we
simply
don't
know.
there's
certainly
no
basis
in
this
record
for
concluding
that
colston
made
a
jencks
act
error
or
any
other.
and
i
should
reiterate:
he
had
the
assistance
of
another
attorney
who
in
fact
was
experienced.
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
in
this
regard
is
that
an
attorney
who
does
not
have
extensive
prior
experience
in
a
criminal
case
will
often
compensate
for
that
lack
of
experience
by
unusual
or
atypical
zeal
in
preparing
the
case
and
doing
perhaps
more
research
and
more
preparation
than
another
lawyer
might
do.
perhaps
he
would
have
more
time
to
do
so.
but
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
it
would
be
illogical
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
set
aside
a
conviction
on
the
basis
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
solely
on
the
basis
of
counsel's
experience
when...
or
if
that
attorney
performed
in
exactly
the
same
way
an
experienced
lawyer
would
do.
in
those
circumstances
there
could
be
no
claim
that
the
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
had
been
abridged.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
this,
the
first
prong
of
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
under
powell,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
in
this
case
seems
to
us
to
be
directly
contrary
to
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
morris
versus
slappy,
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
the
scheduling
of
trials
presents
a
considerable
problem
for
district
courts
and
that
the
court's
scheduling
of
a
trial
will
not
be
set
aside
except
in
the
face
of
an
arbitrary
action.
and
in
these
circumstances,
where
the
court
in
fact
granted
the
continuance
rather
than
denying
it,
as
in
morris
versus
slappy,
we
think
it
follows
clearly
that
there
is
no
basis
for
setting
aside
the
conviction.
basically
what
the
tenth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case,
then,
is
simply
to
second-guess
the
district
court's
ruling
on
a
continuance
under
the
guise
of
adopting
a
five-part
balancing
test
on
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
we
think
that
that's
inconsistent
with
the
approach
in
morris.
i
would
also
like
to
briefly
address
respondent's
second
argument
in
this
case,
going
to
allegations
of
specific
defects
in
attorney
colston's
performance
at
trial.
as
i
mentioned
before,
most
of
these
specific
claims
were
not
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals,
including
the
claim
of
a
lack
of
criminal
intent,
and
we
therefore
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
review
the
record
and
go
through
all
of
the
myriad
claims
that
respondent
has
raised
for
the
first
time
to
determine
whether
there
has
actually
been
a
specific
error.
we
have
addressed
several
of
those
claims
in
our
brief.
but
we
do
think
in
this
case
that
the
nature
of
the
claims
respondent
is
making
is
instructive
and
in
fact
vividly
illustrates
the
problems
that
will
be
created
if
this
court
does
not
adopt
a
test
as
to
reviewing
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
that
requires
a
look
to
see
whether
there
was
a
fundamental
defect
in
the
proceedings
that
resulted
from
the
attorney's
actions,
rather
than
looking
at
the
attorney's
actions
in
their
own
right.
what
respondent
has
done
is
to
comb
the
record
to
second-guess
the
counsel's
performance
as
if
the
purpose
were
to
grade
the
lawyer,
rather
than
to
see
what
happened
to
the
client.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
stress
that
there
are
a
number
of
difficulties
with
this
approach,
a
number
of
things
that
should
give
a
court
pause
before
it
engages
in
this
sort
of
post
hoc
review
of
counsel's
litigating
strategy.
first,
it
requires
an
unseemly
probing
in
many
cases
of
the
lawyer's
thought
processes
and
communications
with
his
client.
in
the
long
term,
this
could
have
a
very
disheartening
effect
for
defense
counsel,
knowing
that
they
would
be
routinely
exposed
in
their
litigating
judgments
to
scrutiny
after
the
trial,
and
this
could
have
the
effect
of
deferring
people
from
accepting
appointments
in
criminal
cases.
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
is
in
some
respects
as
perversion
of
the
adversary
process.
a
hearing
such
as
that
required
to
determine
why
the
lawyer
did
what
when
has
the
effect
of
putting
the
lawyer
in
the
awkward
position
of
defending
himself,
while
not
wanting
to
undermine
his
client's
claim
for
relief.
and
at
the
same
time
it
puts
the
prosecutor
in
the
position
of
defending
his
former
adversary's
actions,
to
say
that
they
were
reasonable
and
effective.
third,
it's
often
a
highly
subjective
inquiry,
because
it
requires
predictions
about
the
state
of
the
law,
what
the
attorney
perceived
in
the
case
at
the
time.
fourth,
it
undermines
the
independence
of
defense
counsel,
independence
that
this
court
held
just
two
terms
ago
in
polk
county
is
constitutionally
mandated;
that
once
the
lawyer
is
freed
of
the
external
restraints
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
that
is
effectively
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
which
the
sixth
amendment
refers.
but
under
a
rule
that
did
not
require
a
substantial
showing,
the
result
could
be
to
have
courts
and
prosecutors
oversee
defense
counsel's
actions
at
trial
in
order
to
prevent
the
conviction
from
later
being
set
aside.
and
also,
under
our
adversary
system,
the
heart
of
it,
the
premise
of
it,
is
that
the
attorney,
either
retained
or
appointed,
who
assumes
responsibility
in
a
criminal
case,
is,
as
the
court
said
in
polk
county,
performing
an
essentially
private
function,
and
the
integrity
of
the
adversary
process
depends
on
the
presumption
that
the
attorney
will
perceive
his
duties
and
will
conscientiously
perform
them
according
to
his
ethical
responsibilities.
so
the
court
should
give
effect
to
that
presumption.
and
last,
to
have
too
quick
an
inquiry
into
counsel's
actual
performance
would
detract
from
the
trial
itself,
because
our
adversary
system
attaches
finality
to
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
it
presupposes
that
a
trial
of
the
defendant
himself
will
not
automatically
be
followed
by
a
trial
of
the
attorney,
as
justice
brennan
observed
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
wainright
versus
sykes.
therefore,
we
believe
a
substantial
showing
should
be
made
before
these
sorts
of
inquiries
are
made,
and
in
our
view
the
appropriate
objective
criterion
for
this
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
defect
in
the
proceedings
that
resulted
from
counsel's
action.
this
is
an
anchor,
something
rooted
in
the
proceedings
themselves,
rather
than
in
counsel's
actions,
to
be
guided
by
the
court...
to
guide
the
court.
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
party
in
litigation
cannot
ordinarily
get
a
valid
judgment
set
aside
by
saying
his
attorney
made
a
mistake.
the
usual
relief
that
a
client
has
in
those
circumstances
is
against
his
attorney
for
malpractice,
not
to
set
aside
a
conviction
and
impose
the
burdens
on
his
opponent.
and
we
suggest...
and
in
that
malpractice
action,
the
client
would
have
to
show
more
than
that
the
lawyer
didn't
perform
reasonably;
he'd
have
to
show
that
there
was
some
prejudice
as
a
result
and
in
fact,
under
malpractice
law,
that
the
client
would
have
prevailed.
we
suggest
that
a
similar
showing
of
prejudice
is
appropriate
where
what
the
lawyer
seeks
is
to...
or
what
the
defendant
seeks
is
to
have
his
conviction
set
aside.
this
follows
also
from
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
decision
in
gideon.
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
refers
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
if
counsel
is
denied
or
effectively
denied,
as
in
powell,
then
a
conviction
is
set
aside.
but
where
the
claim
is
that
the
lawyer
committed
specific
errors,
it's
our
submission
that
those
errors
must
be
of
comparable
severity,
comparable
seriousness
or
gravity
to
an
outright
denial
of
counsel
in
order
for
relief
to
be
granted.
and
because
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment,
as
stated
in
gideon
and
other
cases,
is
to
guarantee
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings,
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceedings,
we
suggest
that
the
inquiry
therefore
is
whether
counsel's
errors
affected
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
this
is
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
in
mcmann
versus
richardson
13
years
ago,
which
addresses
this
area,
in
which
the
focus
of
the
court's
concern
was
not
simply
on
how
the
lawyer
performed,
but
what
effect
it
had
on
the
client.
did
it
render
his
guilty
plea
an
unintelligent
act?
if
so,
then
few
would
dispute
that
the
conviction
resting
on
that
sort
of
guilty
plea
would
be
unfair.
it
also
directly
corresponds
to
this
court's
decision
in
agurs,
where
the
court
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is
not
to
find
fault
or
to
award
relief
on
the
basis
of
fault
of
the
prosecutor,
the
other
attorney
in
the
case,
but
to
guarantee
fairness
to
the
accused.
by
the
same
token,
we
think
where
the
defense
counsel's
conduct
has
fallen
into
question
that
same
parallel
applies.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
several
points,
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
first
with
respect
to
the
discussion
during
mr.
duke's
argument
about
what
the
client
may
have
told
the
attorney,
i
think
that
issue
is
highly
relevant,
as
is...
and
respondent
concedes
this,
too...
the
information
that
counsel
receives
from
the
government.
in
this
case
the
investigative
file
is
relevant
as
to
counsels'
duty
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
his
professional
obligation
to
assess...
after
all,
that's
what
counsel's
for,
to
assess
the
circumstances
facing
the
defendant
and
try
to
make
some
judgment
as
to
what's
worth
pursuing
and
what
isn't.
and
again,
i
think
it's
useful
to
draw
on
the
analogy
in
the
agurs
decision,
where
the
court
determined
the
materiality
of
the
evidence
that
should
have
been
turned
over
to
the
defense
in
terms
of
how
it
would
have
appeared
to
the
prosecutor,
its
materiality,
the
weight
of
whether
it
was
a
close
case
or
not
a
close
case.
we
think
precisely
the
same
rule
applies
with
respect
to
judging
defense
counsel's
performance,
including
the
weight
of
the
government's
case,
and
that's
the
very
reason
why
we
believe
it
is
appropriate
in
judging
the
element
of
prejudice
in
a
case
like
this
to
see
whether
in
fact
what
the
lawyer
would
have
done
would
have
had
any
effect
on
the
outcome,
given
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
in
this
case,
i
submit
that,
while
mr.
duke
has
come
up
with
a
defense
that
might
be
theoretically
plausible,
to
suggest
that
this
sort
of
defense
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
would
have
had
any
effect
on
the
jury's
determination
of
respondent's
guilt
or
innocence
is,
we
submit,
quite
incredible.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
i
understood
mr.
duke
to
be
mixing
the
two
of
them.
i
did
not
understand--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
did
not
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
mix
the
two
of
them.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
respect
to
the
performance
standard--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
with
respect
to
the
powell
versus
alabama
sort
of
argument,
where
the
time
doesn't
even
approach
the
one
day,
we
think
that
respondent
should
at
least
identify
something
that
his
clients
were
prohibited
from
doing
that
had
some
realistic
effect
on
counsel's
preparation.
but
there's
no
suggestion
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
would
be
the
purpose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
we'd
say
it
could
still
go
there
for
defendant
to
make
his
showing
that
there
was
some
effect.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
