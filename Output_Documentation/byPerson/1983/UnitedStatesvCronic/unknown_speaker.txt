unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
i'm
troubled
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
there
are
two
different
types
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims:
one
where
the
state
itself
impairs
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
either
by
not
appointing
counsel
at
all
or
by
taking
some
action
that
would
impair
the
right;
a
second
time
is,
assuming
there's
no
interference
by
the
court
or
the
state
as
such
with
counsel,
counsel
simply
fails
to
meet
whatever
standard
it
is
that
the
court
might
adopt.
now,
which
type
of
claim
was
litigated
here?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it
was
an
impairment
by
the
state
itself,
in
effect,
of--
unknown
speaker
--the
right
to
counsel.
now,
is
that
the
presentation
that
was
made
by
the
defendant
in
this
case,
the
respondent?
or
did
the
respondent
argue
some
other
kind?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
did
the
court
of
appeals
resolve
only
the
first
type
of
claim?
unknown
speaker
is
the
other
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
dealt
only
with
the
part
type,
do
we
have
to
remand
as
to
the
second
type?
unknown
speaker
that's
on
the
assumption
that
we
reversed.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
assumption,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
he
could
do
that,
mr.
kneedler,
unless
we're
to
adopt
a
flat
rule
that
assistance
of
counsel
claims
can't
be
raised
on
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
particular
case,
supposing
that
the
respondent
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
specific
failings
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
felt
they
didn't
have
to
get
to
that
because
of
the
shortness
of
time
which
counsel
had
and
his
lack
of
experience.
then
if
we
decided
that
was
wrong,
why
wouldn't
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
if
we
didn't
decide
the
other
issues
ourselves,
to
let
them
consider
things
that
had
been
properly
raised
before
them
in
the
first
instance?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
major
objection
of
respondent
was
not
the
actions
of
the
lawyer,
but
the
non-actions.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
said
that
he
had
to
show
that
he
did
some
wrong.
he
said
he
didn't
do
anything.
unknown
speaker
but
the
burden
is
not
on
the
lawyer,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
burden
is
on
him
to
show
that
he
is
inefficient?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
starts
off
with
one
that
he
always
asserts,
which
is
that
he
was
convicted;
ergo,
counsel
must
have
been
ineffective.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
one
exception,
the
powell
case.
unknown
speaker
that's
an
exception?
unknown
speaker
there
was
one
other
one:
they
appointed
the
whole
bar.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
make
an
appointment.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
in
a
small
town.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
limited
to
a
small
town,
the
avery
case.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean,
mr.
kneedler,
we're
down
to
the
difference
between
30
and
the
25
days?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
how
long
mr.
colston
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar?
unknown
speaker
did
the
defendant
argue
that
his
experience
as
a
real
estate
lawyer
fell
below
any
required
standing?
is
that
an
argument
made?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
that
he
was
not
a
criminal
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
he
was
a
real
estate
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
and
that
somehow
fell
below
a
constitutional
standard?
unknown
speaker
on
the
day
when
the
case
was
called
for
trial,
did
he
ask
for
more
time,
defense
counsel
ask
for
more
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
what
do
you
say
about
his
argument
that
the
best
defense
was
the
absence
of
criminal
intent,
and
that
the
lawyer
didn't
raise
that
defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
repaid,
would
it
not,
if
the
two
directors
who
signed
the
note
made
good
on
the
note?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
in
your
experience,
do
you
know
of
many
real
estate
lawyers
that
have
experience
in
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
real
estate
law
involve
state
law?
unknown
speaker
did
he
know
anything
about
the
jencks
act?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
by
that
that
25
days
was
not
enough
time
to
prepare
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
30
were?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
ask
for
any
more.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
25
days
later,
however,
he...
we
must
presume
he
knew
something
more
about
the
case,
and
he
didn't
ask
for
more
time.
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
your
position
that
that's
incompetent
also.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
does
not
happen
regularly
in
the
courtrooms,
trial
courtrooms,
mr.
duke?
unknown
speaker
and
that
frequently
continuances
are
granted
under
precisely
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
i
guess
there
was
a
second
experienced
criminal
lawyer
also
appointed
to
assist,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
an
experienced
criminal
lawyer
who
remained
available?
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
how
much
federal
experience
colston
had?
i
mean,
had
he
ever
been
in
a
federal
courtroom
before?
is
it
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
duke,
every
lawyer
is
going
to
have
his
first
trial.
are
you
suggesting
that
that
trial
must
necessarily
be
a
civil
trial,
so
that
one
newer
tries
a
criminal
case
having
to
admit
that
this
is
your
first
criminal
case?
unknown
speaker
you
were
in
arizona
in
the
late
fifties,
weren't
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
remember
the
practice
of
the
district
courts
there?
the
federal
district
judges
appointed
fairly
newly
admitted
lawyers,
and
that's
where
a
lot
of
people
got
their
experience.
now,
some
of
them
were
said
to
have
a
whole
cell
block
at
leavenworth
named
after
them--
[laughter]
--because
perhaps
they
didn't
render
absolutely
first-rate
assistance.
but
do
you
think
that
system
is
just
patently
unacceptable
under
today's
standards?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
law
schools,
mr.
duke,
that
do
not
teach
criminal
law?
unknown
speaker
of
the
180
law
schools
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
criminal
law
is
not
a
required
course
in
law
schools
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
duke,
is
it
your
position
that
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
an
attorney
with
more
experience
than
mr.
colston
had?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
by
that
by
analogy
that
this
court's
holding
in
faretta
has
created
an
inherently
unfair
situation,
where
the
defendant
may
waive
the
lawyer
and
try
the
case
himself,
even
though
he
has
never
seen
a
courthouse?
unknown
speaker
flattery
will
get
you
nowhere,
mr.
duke.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
you
said
you
want
to
focus
on
what
the
trial
judge
did
wrong,
was
what
you
said.
is
that
what
you
meant?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
the
trial
judge
did
wrong,
why
wouldn't
that
be
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
getting
to
the
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel
issue,
just
on
the
grounds
of
errors
of
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
agree
that
that
was
the
basis
on
which
it
was
litigated
below
and
that
that
was
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
do
you
not?
and
that's
apparently
what
mr.
kneedler
agrees
today.
so
we
don't
even
have
to
talk
about
the
actual
effective
assistance
or
lack
thereof
of
mr.
colston.
we
just
have
to
look
at
what
the
trial
court
did,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
do
have
to
end
up
finding
that
counsel
was
ineffective,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
a
lawyer
had
had
only
three
or
four
days
time
to
prepare
a
case,
and
that
the
record
were
reviewed
by
experienced
counsel
who
said
he
conducted
the
trial
flawlessly.
now,
the
judge
probably
made
a
mistake
in
appointing
some
novice
to
try
a
case
on
five
days
notice,
but
if
he
tries
the
case
well
do
we
have
to
reverse?
is
it
a
per
se
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
we
really
try
the
judge
first?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
record
shows
he
tried
the
case
flawlessly?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
he
loses
there's
a
per
se
rule?
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
one
of
my
problems
is
what
you
just
mentioned,
going
over
the
record.
in
your
own
experience,
have
you
gone
over
a
record
and
read
it
and
said,
oh,
my
goodness,
i
couldn't
have
done
that?
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
haven't
you
said
that?
unknown
speaker
we
all
have.
unknown
speaker
so
is
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
another
question
similar
to
the
same
sort
of
problem
that
justice
marshall
identified.
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
true
of
this
case,
but
suppose
defense
counsel
interviews
his
client
and,
with
the
privilege
attaching,
the
client
says
to
his
lawyer:
well,
i
did
it.
i
don't
know,
there's
just
no
doubt
about
it.
i
guess
they
caught
me,
or
i'm
guilty.
he
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
and
so
the
lawyer
then
makes
a
judgment
there
really
isn't
any
point
in
going
out
and
interviewing
a
lot
of
witnesses.
and
later
on
the
man
is
convicted,
and
he
later
files
a
post-conviction
proceeding
attacking
the
competence
of
counsel
for
failure
to
interview
witnesses,
there
might
be
18
people
he
names.
and
the
lawyer
says,
i
didn't.
you
ask
him
why.
what's
he
going
to
say?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
don't
think
he
can
reveal
what
the
client
told
him,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
is
it
gone?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
may
give
you
some
idea
of
what
is,
you
know,
a
useful
way
to
allocate
your
time.
unknown
speaker
you
normally
don't
have
25
full
days
to
prepare
for
any
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
your
client
tells
you
can
have
a
crucial
role
to
play,
could
it
not,
in
your
duty
to
investigate
and
the
extent
of
it?
unknown
speaker
in
what
way?
he
tells
you
he's
guilty
and
there
are
14
possible
witnesses
you
might
interview.
you
mean,
can
he
just
then
not
interview
the
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
he
dispense
with
any
witness
then,
because
the
fellow
says,
i'm
guilty?
i
mean,
what
good
will
any
witnesses
do?
unknown
speaker
they
can
only
testify,
they'd
only
testify,
maybe
not
as
clearly
as
in
your
alibi
case,
but
nevertheless
they
will
be
attempting
to
establish
a
non-fact.
unknown
speaker
and
they
also
may
be
crazy.
unknown
speaker
but
in
a
complicated
scheme
such
as
is
involved
in
a
massive
check-kiting
case,
ignorance
of
the
consequences
would
hardly
be
something
suggested
by
the
defendant
here,
do
you
think?
this
arrangement
had
to
take
a
great
deal
of
planning
and
timing.
unknown
speaker
well,
were
there
some
guilty
pleas
here?
unknown
speaker
what
specific
intent
do
you
think
the
statute
requires?
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
you
say
that
the
banks
must
have
been
aware
of
this.
but
in
most
check-kiting
schemes,
doesn't
it
turn
out
that
if
the
banks
had
actually
canvased
the
particular
ebb
and
flow
in
a
particular
account
they
would
have
been
aware
of
the
kiting
operation,
but
banks
just
generally
don't
do
that
until
something
goes
wrong?
unknown
speaker
mr.
duke,
isn't
it
also
true
that
the
amount
of
this
flow
of
checks
was
also
grossly
larger
than
the
actual
cash
flow
of
the
man's
business?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it's
kind
of
hard
to
treat
it
as
an
ordinary
float,
like
you
characterize
the
corporations.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
grossly
so.
weren't
there
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
checks
and
about
$100,000
of
gross
revenues?
unknown
speaker
those
are
kind
of
tough
facts
to
work
with,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
would
impress
a
lay
jury,
however,
even
if
it
didn't
appeal
to
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
or
by
his
experienced
colleague?
unknown
speaker
was
this
argument
made
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
this
very
argument
you
just
made.
unknown
speaker
no,
about
the
adequate
defense.
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
there
was
a
perfectly
sound
defense
available
that
was
ignored.
unknown
speaker
obviously,
then,
it
wasn't
you
who
argued
the
case?
unknown
speaker
he
was
pro
se
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
are
you
the
first
lawyer
in
this
entire
case
who's
discovered
that
there
was
a
perfectly
adequate
defense
available
that
was
ignored?
unknown
speaker
any
lawyer
who
didn't
recognize
it
would
have
been
incompetent,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
lawyer
trying
a
case
doesn't
have
the
benefit
of
a
nice
record
unfolding
that
you
can
look
over
afterwards
and
say,
well,
gee,
that
was
here
all
the
time.
i
don't
think
any
lawyer
who
has
tried
a
case
ever
figures
that
he
knows
the
case,
even
on
a
day
by
day
basis,
the
way
he
should.
so
i
think
some
things
that
look
clear
from
the
record
after
the
thing
is
over
may
not
have
been
quite
as
apparent
while
the
case
was
being
tried.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
submission
is...
it
seems
to
me
really
goes
to
counsel's
actual
performance,
rather
than
to
this
powell-type
invalidation
of
this
trial
or
setting
aside
of
this
conviction.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
he
is,
i
know
he
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
didn't,
i
agree.
i
agree
with
that.
but
when
he
gets
down
to
saying,
here's
what
counsel
ignored,
it's
a
performance
standard.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
because
it
is,
that's
why
you're
saying
there
wasn't
a
showing
of
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
defendant
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
the
judge
said,
sorry,
you
don't
get
one,
there's
just
nothing
a
lawyer
could
do
for
you.
no.
under
gideon,
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
is
deemed
essential
to
fundamental
fairness,
as
is
some
minimal
period
or
opportunity
to
prepare.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
we
submit.
and
lastly,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
per
se
rule
being
suggested
here
with
respect
to
25
days,
30
days,
it's
a
little
hard
to
tell
precisely
what
rule
respondent
is
arguing
for,
what
amount
of
time
would
have
been
sufficient.
but
to
the
extent
there
are
going
to
be
legislative-type
rules
as
to
when
the
case
is
brought
to
trial,
that
would
seem
to
be
appropriate
for
either
legislation
or
rules,
not
a
decision
by
this
court
on
a
case
by
case
basis
in
the
court
of
appeals
approach,
second-guessing
the
trial
court's
approach
to
the
case.
the
trial
court
acted
responsibly
in
these
circumstances
and
there's
no
indication
that
it
had
any
effect
on
the
lawyer's
preparation.
could
this
case
have
gone
to
collateral
relief?
unknown
speaker
and
tried
out
the
question
of
counsel's
actual
performance?
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
done
any
good,
for
example,
to
interview
all
of
these
witnesses
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
could
it
still
go
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
there
were
something
decided
here,
because
under
the
habeas
statute
the
habeas
court
can't
review
anything
that's
been
decided
on
the
merits
here.
