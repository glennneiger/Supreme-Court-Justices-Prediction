ms.
ann
l.
ritter
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
this
is
a
matter
simply
of
clarification
of
language
and
that
it
simply
is
a
matter
of
cosmetic
changes
having
been
made
to
our
laws
which
cosmetic
changes
don't
have
any
meaning
at
all.
it's
the
government's
contention
that
the
passage
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980
made
no
change
in
the
standard
an
alien
must
meet
in
order
to
have
deportation
withheld
on
the
ground
that
he
would
be
subject
to
persecution
in
his
own
country.
it
is
also
the
government's
contention
that
the
standard
prior
to
the
act's
passage,
which
was
clear
probability
of
persecution,
and
the
standard
subsequent
to
the
passage
of
the
refugee
act,
which
was
well-founded
fear
of
persecution,
are
really
one
and
the
same,
and
by
mixing
up
the
language
and
using
the
different
terms
indiscriminately,
that
we
might
be
able
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
well--
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
--the
congressional
committee
at
the
time
that
section
243(h)
was
amended,
the
congressional
committee
reported
that
the
changes
in
the
refugee
act
had
to
be
construed
consistent
with
the
united
nations
protocol
relating
to
the
status
of
refugees.
now,
the
united
nations
protocol
makes
it
very
clear
what
their
standard
was,
which
was
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
also,
this
was
referred
to
just
a
few
minutes
ago,
but
only
in
part.
it
would
say
that
the
substantive
standard
is
not
changed
was
what
had
been
reported
to
congress.
in
addition
to
that...
this
is
on
page
39
if
the
government's
brief...
there
is
a
statement,
"asylum
will
continue
to
be
granted
only
to
those
who
qualify
under
the
terms
of
the
united
nations
protocol
relating
to
the
status
of
refugees,
to
which
the
united
states
acceded
in
november
1969.
"
in
other
words,
when
the
refugee
act
of
1980
was
passed,
it
was
the
intent,
it
was
the
clear
intent
of
congress
that
we
should
follow
our
obligations
under
the
united
nations
protocol,
and
that
we
should
recognize
a
new
standard.
now,
one
of
the
problems
is
that
i
don't
believe
that
it
was
recognized
by
the
congress
that
the
old
standard
had
made
such
a
mess
of
itself,
and
that
is
one
of
the
major
problems
here.
the
old
standard
had
been...
had
grown
up
through
section
243(h).
originally,
section
243(h)
gave
to
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
withhold
deportation
in
his
discretion
if
it
was
found
that
the
alien
would
be
subject
to
persecution.
this
discretion
to
withhold
deportation
was
assumed
to
me
by
the
attorney
general
that
they
could
determine
the
standard
and,
since
there
was
no
other...
since
there
was
at
that
time
no
law
giving
them
any
other
criteria,
that
they
could
just
determine
the
standard
by
which
an
alien
would
not
be
deported.
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
as
enunciated
in
the
very
early
cases
was
that
there
should
be
a
clear
probability
of
persecution
and
that
an
alien
had
to
be
singled
out
for
persecution
in
order
to
avoid
deportation.
now,
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it,
this
language
is
not
the
same
language
that
is
now
used.
why
it
has
continued
to
be
upheld
by
the
government,
i
really
don't
know.
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief
some
possibility,
and
that
possibility
i
felt
was
that
we
had
a
peculiar
situation.
we
had
adhered
to
the
united
nations
protocol
in
1969.
under
the
protocol
we
had
the...
there
was
a
standard
set
forth
for
refugees.
that
was
a
person
who
would
be...
whose
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened
if
he
were
to
be
returned
to
his
own
country.
there
was
a...
it
was
clearly
based
upon
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
after
we
adhered
to
the
protocol,
very
little
was
done
by
the
government
or
by
the
administrative
agencies
to
recognize
their
obligations
under
the
protocol,
practically
nothing.
this
was
in
1968.
the
refugee
act
was
not
passed
until
1979,
i
believe,
and
went
into
force
in
1980.
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
well,
that
was
curious.
the
matter
came
up
in
a
case
called
in
the
matter
of
dunar.
at
that
time
congress...
pardon?
you
were
talking
about
the
ins/+/.
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
--yes.
at
that
time
the
ins
recognized
that
there
was
a
protocol,
and
they
also
recognized
that
we
had
a
standard
which
was
clear
probability
of
persecution,
and
it
tried
to
reconcile
the
two,
and
in
order
to
reconcile
the
two,
it
stated
that
the
protocol
was
a
self-executing
treaty,
and
that
therefore
it
was
part
of
our
domestic
law.
if
this
was
a
self-executing
treaty
and
it
was
part
of
our
domestic
law
to
justify
why
we
were
not
following
our
domestic
law,
it
stated
that
what
we...
and
this
is
very
similar
to
the
argument
now...
it
stated
that
what
we
were
following
was
equivalent
with
almost
the
same,
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
you
are
hearing
today,
almost
the
same,
and
afterwards
i
will
try
to
point
out
why
this
almost
the
same
kind
of
thing
is
very
dangerous.
they
said
that
the...
that
this
was
almost
the
same,
and
therefore,
there
was
absolutely
no
conflict
for
their
obligations
under
the
protocol,
and
that
well-founded
fear
and
clear...
which
was
under
the
protocol's
standard,
and
clear
probability,
were
in
fact
the
same
kind
of
thing,
and
therefore,
an
alien
who
had
asserted
rights
under
the
protocol
could
be
deported.
now,
very...
this
was
all
based
upon
the
fact
of
our
considering
the
protocol
a
self-executing
treaty,
and
a
lot
of
terrible
decisions
have
arisen
out
of
that.
curiously,
very
recently
in
the
federal
register,
in
order
to
support
the
position
that
the
government
is
now
taking
regarding
detention
of
aliens,
the
immigration
service
in
the
federal
register
is
stating
that
the
protocol
was
a
non-self-executing
treaty,
which
of
course
would
have
wiped
out
matter
of
dunar,
and
that
the
immigration
service
therefore
has
the
power
to
follow
only
those
provisions
of
the
protocol
which
have
been
enacted
into
law
in
the
refugee
act
of
1980.
now,
i
am
not
discussing
that
whole
thing.
the
government
takes
whichever
side
it
feels
that
it
should
take
and
then
tries
to
say
that,
well,
if
we
call
this
well-founded
fear
and
it
is
really
clear
probability,
then
they
are
all
really
the
same.
now,
i
would
like
to,
before
i
go
any
further,
make
some
statements
about
the
facts
of
this
case
because
i
think
that
the
difference
between
clear
probability
and
well-founded
fear
can
be
highlighted
by
the
facts,
by
the
very
facts
in
the
stevic
case
and
the
government
has
left
out
some
of
the
facts
which
i
think
would
throw
some
light
on
what
the
difference
is.
mr.
stevic,
as
was
stated,
came
to
the
united
states
in
1976.
he
applied
for
i
think
an
extension.
in
any
case,
he
came
before
an
immigration
judge
who
gave
him
the
ability
to
leave
the
country
voluntarily.
he
was
not
ordered
deported.
shortly
thereafter
he
married
an
american
citizen.
now,
the
background
of
this
lady
has
a
bearing
on
this
case.
her
father
was
a
national
of
yugoslavia
originally
who
had
fled
yugoslavia,
had
gone
to
belgium
where
she
was
born.
she
was
a
united
states
citizen;
her
father
was
a
united
states
citizen,
but
they
were
yugoslavian
by
origin
and
by
ethnic
affiliation.
at
the
time
that
mr.
stevic
married
mirjana
doichin,
her
father,
who
was
a
united
states
citizen,
had
returned
to
yugoslavia
and
had
been
imprisoned,
even
as
a
united
states
citizen,
in
yugoslavia
for
three
years.
he
returned
i
believe
around
1977
or
'78
and
committed
suicide.
at
that
time,
after
he
married
mirjana,
before
he
ever
had
any
need
to
assert
the
fact
that
the
was
a
refugee,
he
became
involved
in
the
efforts
of
the...
in
the
activities
of
the
yugoslavian
community
in
chicago.
he
joined
the
ravnagora,
which
is
an
organization
which
is
trying
to
rid
yugoslavia
of
communism.
he
joined
other
serbian
organizations
in
the
united
states,
outside
of
his
own
country.
he
became
quite
active.
now,
this
was
partially
because
he
was
a
part
of
this
family,
and
this
was
partially
because
of
his
own
conviction.
mr.
stevic
was
a
philosophy
graduate
in
yugoslavia.
he
was
not
a
simple
man.
he
was
a
complicated
man.
perhaps
he
might
have
done
these
things
in
yugoslavia,
but
it
would
have
been
very
dangerous
for
him
to
do
that.
but
certainly
at
this
time,
when
he
did
this,
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
have
been
deported
because
he
was
married
to
an
american
citizen.
he
was
going
to
becoming
a
resident
and
eventually
a
u.s.
citizen
if,
you
know,
by
the
normal
operation
of
our
laws.
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
have
any
repercussion.
he
had
only
a
reason
to
believe
that
in
our
country
he
could
join
these
organizations,
he
could
speak
out,
he
could
be
the
kind
of
person
that
he
would
have
liked
to
have
been,
perhaps,
in
yugoslavia,
and
not
be
persecuted.
now,
in
yugoslavia
there
is
a
very
interesting
law
which
we
don't
have
here,
so
it
seems
bizarre.
it
is
called
hostile
propaganda.
it
is
part
of
the
yugoslavian
constitution.
under
the
yugoslavian
constitution,
if
i
or
you
or
any
of
us,
if
we
are
a
yugoslavian
citizen,
speaks
out
against
the
government
in
any
way
whatsoever...
this
doesn't
mean
that
i
have
to
write
an
article
in
the
newspaper
or
give
a
speech.
i
can
talk
to
you
as
a
friend,
i
can
meet
with
people
at
private
social
gatherings.
certainly
if
i
joined
an
emigre
organization
avowedly
against
the
government,
that
is
more
than
is
required,
but
if
i
do
that,
under
yugoslavia's
hostile
propaganda
laws,
i
will
be
imprisoned
if
i
return
to
yugoslavia.
i
don't
have
to
do
this
in
yugoslavia.
i
can
do
this
outside
of
the
country.
i
can
do
this
as
an
emigre.
this
is
what
poor
mirja's
father
did.
he
though
that
he
was
protected
by
his
u.s.
citizenship,
which
he
wasn't,
because
they
considered
him
still
a
national
of
yugoslavia.
but
i
don't
have
to
be
in
yugoslavia.
i
can
be
anywhere.
now,
even
now...
and
this
is
not
in
the
briefs,
but
i
just
noticed
this
in
the
newspaper
about
two
weeks
ago,
and
i
think
it
is
sort
of
interesting...
there
was
a
yugoslavian
journalist
who
at
private
parties
talked
about
the
government,
and
she
has
now
been
put
in
jail
for
about
a
year,
even
now.
these
are
not
laws
that
are
unknown
to
the
u.s.
government.
there
are
country
reports
that
are
issued
every
year
by
the
united
states
government.
the
information
that
i
am
giving
you
was
partially
obtained
from
the
u.s.
government
country
reports.
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
well,
pardon
me?
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
no.
i
am
saying
that
his
case
may
shed
light
on
the...
how
the
different
standards
can
be
applied,
and
i
will
finish
up
the
facts
of
his
case
in
just
a
moment.
the
only
reason
i
went
into
this
was
because
the
government
skipped
from
the
original
order
of
deportation,
which
did
not
happen
initially
in
1977,
but
later,
after
his
wife
died,
to,
you
know,
to
the
fact
that
he
applied
for
withholding
without
indicating
what
kind
of
information
the
government
had
which,
if--
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
--that's
the
problem.
under
the
clear
probability
standard--
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
--no,
absolutely
not.
under
the
clear
probability
standard,
i
can...
i
must
show
that
i
will
be
singled
out
for
persecution,
i
will
be
singled
out
for
persecution.
it
is
not
necessarily
based
upon
what
happened
in
my
country,
what
happened
to
my
relatives,
what
happened
to
my
father
or
my
mother.
i
must
show
that...
most
refugees,
and
i
am
not--
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
--that
he
could
not
meet
the...
yes.
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
no,
he
could
not.
with
all
of
this,
with
all
of
this,
his
facts,
not
only
do
i
think
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
held
they
did
not
meet
the
clear
probability
test.
that
is
where
the
problem
is
because
they
would
meet
the
well-founded
fear
test.
for
clear
probability,
i
must
show
objective
evidence.
i
have
had
this
problem
with
other
refugees
from
countries
who
left
with
the
clothes
on
their
backs.
what
can
they
show,
a
little
execution
list?
they
don't
carry
that.
what
can
they
show,
a...
there
is
very
little
that
they
can
show.
it
is
my
assertion
that
a
special
inquiry
officer,
a
judge,
should
be
able
to,
using
the
well-founded
fear
standard
which
we
adopted
by
the
adoption
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
should
be
able
to
take
the
subjective
situation
of
an
alien,
determine
whether
or
not
that
subjective
situation
is
supported
by
some
objective
evidence
but
not
the
kind
of
objective
evidence
that
the
government
requires
now
because
under
the
clear
probability
test,
they
require
what
most
people
cannot
produce.
a
determination
can
be
made.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
determination
is
now
required
to
be
made
overseas.
the
government
alluded
to
a
report
that
had
been
issued
by
the
immigration
service.
this
was
in
august
of
this
year.
it
was
issued
to
posts
overseas,
immigration
posts
overseas
to
use
in
determining
who
would
be
qualified
for
refugee
status
so
that
we...
so
that
the
officers
who
would
be
interviewing
would
have
some
guidance.
there
is
guidance
available,
and
in
the
government
report
it
is
stated
individuals
may
be
determined
to
be
refugees
if
they
have
a
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
based
upon
one
of
the
five
bases
named
in
the
act,
race,
religious,
nationality,
membership
in
a
particular
social
group,
or
political
opinion.
the
government
apply...
uses
the
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
test
which
rather
than
say,
well,
we
don't
know
what
that
means,
fellows,
you
will
have
to
decide,
it
has
spent
about
50
pages
of
a
report
defining
what
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
is.
there
is
guidance.
now,
the
definition
follows
the
united
nations
handbook
that
was
referred
to
in
many
of
the
briefs.
in
one
part
it
states
that
refugee
status
may
be
based
upon
persecution
suffered
in
the
past
or
upon
a
likely...
the
likelihood
of
future
persecution.
now,
it
also
states
that
the
present
of
both
conditions
is
not
required.
now,
under
the
singled
out
for
persecution
test,
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
my
background,
back
where
i
came
from,
the
fact
that
i
had
been
persecuted,
the
possibility
of
future
persecution
which
would
have
to
be
inferred
by
a
person
with
some
understanding
of
the
background
who
uses
the
government
reports
and
some
understanding
of
the...
but
an
intelligent
person
i
think
using
the
guidelines
that
have
been
issued
by
the
immigration
service
itself
could
make
a
determination
of
what
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
would
be.
in
the
clear
probability
test,
a
person
who
has
nothing
but
his
clothes
and
who
simply
says
i
come
from
indonesia,
i
am
a
chinese
national,
they
are
burning
our
stores,
they
are
wiping
us
out,
we
are
not
allowed
to
work,
they
are
terrorizing
our
children,
assuming
that
there
is
a
country
report
that
shows
that...
and
by
the
way,
over
here
there
is
one,
or
it
states
that
there
is
one...
assuming
that
is
correct,
his
own
statement
under
the
clear
probability
test
would
not
have
been
regarded
as
enough.
under
the
new
regulations
which
the
government
has
adopted,
it
says
a
statement
by
the
applicant
must
not
be
disregarded
solely
because
it
is
self-serving
and
that
it
supports
his
own
claim.
testimony
by
the
applicant
is
frequently
all
that
is
available,
and
if
that
testimony
is
credible,
it
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
claim
to
refugee
status.
an
overall
assessment
of
credibility
should
be
made
by
the
adjudicator,
and
then
it
goes
on.
now,
we
are
not
talking
about
an
impossibility
in
applying
the
new
standard
which
forces
us
to
stick
with
the
old
standard
because
we
sort
of
knew
what
that
was
and
therefore
we
sort
of
know
what
this
is.
there
are
guidelines.
it
is
possible
to
follow
a
new
standard.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
hinges
upon
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
change.
there
has
been
a
change.
by
the
government's
own
admission,
we
did
not
regard
the
protocol
as
binding,
but
we
do
regard
the
refugee
act
as
binding.
maybe
we
should
have
regarded...
i
spoke
at
some
length
about
the
concept
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
self-executing
treaty,
but
the
point
is
that
whether
or
not
it
wasn't,
if
we
take
some
cognizance
of
how
the
immigration
service
has
regarded
it,
they
have
regarded
it
as
a
non-self-executing
treaty
right
now
as
of
last
year,
and
that
they
regard
the
law
which
put
into
domestic
effect
what
the
protocol
tried
to
have
us
follow
in
terms
of
our
regard
for
refugees,
that
certainly
is
a
law,
and
we
can
say
that
these
are
just
cosmetic
changes.
these
are
not
cosmetic
changes.
these
are
changes
which
will...
which
have
meaning
behind
them,
which
have...
which
it
is
possible
to
judge.
i
believe
that
some
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
second
circuit's
statement
that
they
did
not
want
to
go
into
what
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
meant.
that
might
be
that
if
we
are
bringing
into
our
domestic
legislation
the
standards
that
we
had
promised
to
bring
into
our
domestic
legislation
by
adhering
to
the
united
nations
protocol,
then
there
is
voluminous
information
and
guidelines
specific
guidelines,
handbooks
of
the
government,
handbooks
of
the
united
nations,
that
tell
us
what
clear
probability
of
persecution
means
without
the
second
circuit
having
to
write
an
80
page
decision
telling
us.
i
don't
think
that
that
was
necessary,
but
for
the
government
to
say
that
because
they
said
that
they
wouldn't
go
into
that
now,
that
it
was...
you
know,
that
that
is
a
matter
that
is
still
left
in
the
large
haze
is
certainly
not
true.
ms.
ann
l.
ritter
if
you
conclude
that
the
two
standards
are
one
and
the
same,
it
would
appear
that
would
be
the
end
of
my
case.
but
it
would
also
mean
that
we
would
be
giving
no
recognition
whatsoever
to
the
language
that
we
have
tried
so
hard
to
put
into
our
domestic
law.
now,
speaking
about
that,
the
government
stated
that
our
accession
to
the
protocol
was
passed
with
practically
no
discussion
in
the
senate.
i
don't
know
whether
anybody
here
is
aware
of
it,
but
the
well-founded
fear
standard
in
the
united
nations
convention
was
developed
partially
by
the
united
states.
although
we
did
not
become
signatories
to
the
convention,
we
were
one
of
the
prime
instruments
in
writing
that
convention.
this
terminology
is
something
that
the
united
states
gave
to
the
united
nations.
also,
in
the
passage
of
the
1968
protocol,
the
language
of...
if
you
read
the
senate
reports,
which
i
have,
the
language
was
modified
several
times.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
language
in
the
united
states
law
is
broader,
broader,
gives
more
rights
to
refugees
than
the
language
in
the
united
nations
protocol.
so
it
can't
be
that
we
didn't
know
what
we
were
doing,
that
we
just
sort
of
said
let's
do
something
to
adhere
to
our
obligations,
let's
look
like
good
guys
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
world.
we
didn't
have
to
do
that
because
we
do,
we
do
look
good,
and
we
have
done
a
lot
of
very
good
things
for
refugees.
we
are
talking
about
one
specific
area
where
we
are
not
doing
good
things
and
where
we
should
have.
now,
i
will
just
summarize
at
this
point.
i
just
have
a
few
more
minutes.
it
is
my
contention
that
with
the
passage
of
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
the
congress
intended
to
change
the
standard
used
for
withholding
of
deportation.
because
of
that,
it
amended
section
243(h)
and
it
incorporated
for
the
first
time
in
any
of
our
legislation
a
definition
of
refugee
which
is
taken
directly
from
the
united
nations
protocol
definition
which
we
had
helped
to
develop.
this
is
clearly
an
intention
to
change
our
law.
we
had
never
had
any
definition
of
refugee
prior
to
the
refugee
act.
with
this
change,
we
had
certain
obligations.
we
had
to
change
our
administrative
regulations
so
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
would
recognize
what
the
changes
were.
unfortunately,
that
did
not
happen.
it
has
happened
recently.
it
didn't
happen
immediately.
now,
because
it
didn't
happen
immediately,
i
see
no
reason
to
say
that
because
it
didn't
happen
it
shouldn't
happen.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
happening
now.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
standard
that
is
now
being
used
for
determining
who
should
be
allowed
into
the
country
and
who
should
not
be...
should
not
be
deported
is
based
upon
the
united
nations
standard
of
well-founded
fear
of
persecution
which
is
now
the
united
states
standard,
which
is
well-founded
fear
of
persecution.
we
knew
what
we
were
doing.
it
is
time
for
the
government
to
be
told
what
it
is
the
standard
is,
to
be
told
that
it
can't
say
one
thing
and
do
something
else...
that
is
what
the
problem
is...
by
saying
two
things
are
the
same.
they
will
do
what
they
have
continued
to
do
previously
and
deny
withholding
to
people
who
should
get
withholding
based
upon
what
the
intention
of
our
domestic
law
was.
we
stated
that
we
intended
to
conform
our
domestic
law
with
our
obligations
under
the
protocol.
i
would
assume
that
we
meant
that.
thank
you
very
much.
