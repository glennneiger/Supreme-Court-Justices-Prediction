mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
congress,
when
it
passed
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
intended
to
change
the
substantive
standard
that
an
alien
must
meet
under
section
243(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
in
order
to
avoid
deportation
on
the
ground
that
he
would
be
subject
to
persecution.
although
the
second
circuit
stated
that
the
matter
was
not
free
from
doubt,
that
court
held
that
congress
in
1980
had
intended
to
make
a
significant
change
in
the
substantive
standard
under
section
243(h).
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
congress'
intent,
and
that
it
will
create
harmful
problems
for
the
administration
of
the
immigration
laws.
the
facts
here
may
be
briefly
stated.
respondent
stevic
came
to
this
country
as
a
nonimmigrant
visitor
from
yugoslavia
in
1976.
respondent
stayed
here
beyond
the
time
authorized
in
his
visa,
and
he
was
therefore
ordered
deported
in
december
1976,
but
respondent
at
that
time
designated
yugoslavia
as
the
country
to
which
he
wished
to
be
deported.
respondent
did
not
leave
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
this
deportation
order;
instead,
in
1977
he
moved
to
reopen
his
deportation
proceedings,
to
apply
for
withholding
relief
under
section
243(h).
respondent
contended
that
he
had
recently
joined
a
serbian
anticommunist
organization
in
chicago
and
that
as
a
result,
he
feared
he
would
be
subject
to
persecution
on
the
basis
of
his
political
opinions
if
he
were
to
be
returned
home
to
yugoslavia.
the
immigration
judge
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
the
motion
to
reopen
on
the
grounds
that
respondent's
application
consisted
largely
of
conclusory
assertions,
and
that
respodent
hadn't
made
a
sufficient
showing
that
he
was
likely
to
be
singled
out
for
persecution
if
he
went
home
to
yugoslavia.
respondent
did
not
appeal
that
decision.
in
february
1981
the
ins
again
ordered
respondent
to
surrender
for
deportation,
and
he
responded
by
filing
a
second
motion
to
reopen
his
deportation
proceedings
in
order
to
renew
his
request
for
withholding
relief
under
section
243(h).
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
denied
this
request
in
september
1981
saying
that
respondent's
second
motion
to
reopen
was
identical
to
his
first,
and
that
he
is
still
hadn't
submitted...
he
still
had
submitted
evidence
only
of
general
conditions
in
yugoslavia
and
hadn't
provided
any
direct
evidence
that
he
personally
would
be
subject
to
persecution
if
he
were
sent
home.
i
should
add
that
at
no
time
during
the
proceedings
on
the
second
motion
to
reopen
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
which
took
place
in
1981,
did
respondent
claim
that
the
refugee
act
of
1980
had
changed
the
substantive
standard
for
judging
243(h)
claims.
now,
respondent
sought
review
of
the
bia's
denial
of
the
second
motion
to
reopen,
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
congress
in
1980,
when
it
passed
the
refugee
act,
had
intended
to
substantially
liberalize
the
standard
that
an
alien
must
satisfy
under
section
243(h).
the
court
of
appeals
declined
to
announce
what
in
its
view
was
the
proper
standard,
but
it
did
state
that
deportation
must
now
be
withheld
upon
a
showing
far
short
of
the
showing
that
had
to
be
made
prior
to
1980.
the
court
of
appeals
then
remanded
respondent's
case
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
further
proceedings
under
this
new
but
undefined
legal
standard
that
the
second
circuit
had
announced.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
begin
by
briefly
summarizing
the
government's
position
because
it
is
really
quite
a
straightforward
one
and
by
going
back
and
discussing
at
somewhat
greater
length
some
of
the
key
points.
for
at
least
the
last
20
years,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
reviewing
courts
have
applied
a
consistent
legal
standard
in
judging
applications
for
withholding
relief
under
section
243(h).
an
applicant
under
section
243(h)
has
had
to
make
a
subjective
showing
and
an
objective
showing.
the
test
has
required
an
applicant
to
show
both
that
he
fears
persecution
or
feared
persecution
in
the
country
to
which
he
would
be
deported
on
the
basis
of
one
of
the
statutorily
enumerated
grounds...
that
is
the
subjective
showing...
and
that
his
fear
was
supported
by
objective
evidence
demonstrating
a
realistic
likelihood
that
he
would
be
singled
out
for
persecution
if
he
were
deported.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
terms
"clear
probability"
and
"realistic
likelihood"
have
been
used
interchangeably
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
and
i
think
the
board
and
the
courts
have
used
the
words
interchangeably
over
the
years,
which
shows
that
there
is
no
substantive
difference
in
these
catchword
phrases.
they
don't
describe
the
legal
standard;
they
merely
refer
to
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
board
has
always
taken
this
to
be
the
minimum
standard
that
the
alien
must
meet.
in
other
words,
an
alien
over
the
last--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
in
other
words,
over
the
last
20
years,
an
alien
has
had
to
show
consistently
in
order
to
get
relief
from
the
board
or
the
courts
that
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
he
would
be
treated
differently
from
the
mass
of
his
fellow
citizens
in
his
home
country
if
he
were
deported.
now,
prior
to
1968
the
board
generally
referred
to
this
as
reasonable
likelihood
of
persecution.
as
justice
white
mentioned,
on
occasion
some
courts
called
it
a
clear
probability
of
persecution
or
a
reasonable
likelihood.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
well,
the
courts...
that
was
a
phrase
that
actually,
first
of
all,
was
in
a
court
case.
the
board
had
referred
to
it
as
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
persecution.
the
point
is
that
we
can't
get
too
caught
up,
as
i
think
the
second
circuit
was,
with
these
catchword
phrases.
we
have
to
look
at
the
test
that
the
board
was
in
fact
applying
over
these
years
because
however
the
standard
was
denominated,
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
standard
i
just
described
was
the
standard
that
the
board
and
the
courts
had
been
following
consistently
prior
to
1968.
we
don't
take
anybody
to
be
disputing
that.
we
don't
take
respondent
or
the
second
circuit
to
be
disputing
that
it
was
an
appropriate
legal
standard
prior
to
1968
under
section
243(h).
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
not
to
my
knowledge,
justice
blackmun.
now,
that
was
the
situation
prior
to
1968,
and
as
i
say,
there
is
no
assertion
that
the
pre-1968
standard
that
the
board
and
the
courts
had
been
applying
was
in
any
way
incorrect.
there
have
been
two
statutory
changes
since
1968
that
will--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
same,
the
same
standard--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
the
same
standard
was
applied
under
243(h),
which
is
the
withholding
provision--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--as
under
203(a)(7)
which
is...
except
that
203(a)(7)
obviously
had
some
other
ideological
and
geographical
restrictions.
but
the
standard,
the
eligibility
standard,
was
the
same.
now,
there
were,
as
i
said,
two
statutory
changes
since
1968
that
relate
to
refugees.
one
was
the
united
states'
accession
in
1968
to
the
united
nations
protocol
related
to
refugees,
and
the
other
was
the
passage
in
1980
of
the
refugee
act.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
neither
of
the
statutory
changes
was
intended
in
any
way
to
alter
the
substantive
standard
applied
to
section
243(h)
relief,
so
that
if
the
standard
was
correct,
as
we
take
everyone
to
agree
it
was
prior
to
1968,
it
is
still
the
correct
standard
today
because
each
time
congress
has
revisited
this
area
of
the
law,
although
it
has
changed
some
of
the
terminology,
it
has
gone
on
record
as
saying
it
didn't
intend
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
the
standard
that
the
board
and
the
court
should
apply
in
judging
claims
for
withholding
relief.
now,
we
reached
this
conclusion
by
the
following
route.
first,
when
the
senate
acceded
to
the
united
nations
protocol
in
1968,
it
did
so
on
the
express
understanding
that
it
would
not
alter
or
enlarge
the
substance
of
our
immigration
laws
relating
to
withholding
of
deportation
in
any
way.
this
is
what
the
senate
was
told
by
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
is
what
the
senate
was
told
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
what
it
was
told
by
a
representative
of
the
state
department
who
was
the
only
witness
to
testify
before
the
senate
on
the
hearings
that
were
held
on
the
protocol.
we
have--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
well-found...
the
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened
is
simply
a
synonym
for
what
we
had
called
up
until
that
point
persecution,
and
the
well-founded
fear
goes
to
the
substantive
standard
that
an
alien
must
meet
in
order
to
show
that
he
would
be
persecuted.
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
either
change
when
it
adhered
to
the
protocol,
even
though
the
protocol
had
that
different
language,
and
in
fact,
the
different
language,
as
i
will
come
to,
was
worked
into
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
in
1980
with
congress
again
saying
we
don't
intend
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
the
law.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
senate
was
explicitly
told
this
by
everyone
who
testified
on
the
protocol
in
1968.
we
have
quoted
some
of
that
testimony
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
that
laurence
dawson,
who
was
a
representative
of
the
state
department,
said,
and
i
quote,
"accession
does
not
in
any
sense
commit
the
contracting
state.
"
the
united
states,
"to
enlarge
its
immigration
measures
for
refugees.
"
mr.
dawson
also
said
"refugees
in
the
united
states
have
long
enjoyed
the
protection
and
the
rights
which
the
protocol
calls
for,
and
the
united
states
already
meets
the
standard
of
the
protocol.
"
and
the
president
told
the
senate
accession
to
the
protocol
would
not
impinge
adversely
upon
established
practices
under
existing
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
fact,
there
were
in
fact
two
provisions
of
the
protocol
that
could
have
been
taken
to
have
an
adverse
impact
upon
our
domestic
laws.
one
related
to
the
taxation
of
nonresident
aliens;
the
other
related
to
the
receipt
of
social
security
benefits.
the
senate
explicitly
reserved
as
to
those
two
provisions.
its
accession
did
not
cover
those
two
provisions,
so
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
the
protocol
would
not
change
our
domestic
laws
in
any
way.
and
in
fact,
as
we
quote
in
footnote
28,
after
those
reservations,
senator
proxmire
assured
is
colleagues
that
with
the
reservations
included,
this
removes
even
the
slightest
possible
conflict
between
federal
law
and
the
provisions
of
the
protocol.
all
of
the
representations
made
to
the
senate
in
1968
indicated
that
our
immigration
laws
already
included
the
human
provisions
of
the
protocol,
and
perhaps
the
best
evidence
of
this,
the
fact
that
congress
thought
it
was
simply
making
a
symbolic
gesture
when
it
adhered
to
the
protocol,
was
that
there
was
absolutely
no
opposition
to
the
protocol.
there
were
virtually
no
hearings
on
the
protocol,
and
it
passed
the
senate
unanimously.
we
think
it
was
therefore
common
ground
in
1968
that
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear
of
persecution",
which
appears
in
the
protocol,
was
not...
was
meant...
was
thought
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
test
that
the
board
and
the
courts,
whether
dominated
a
realistic
likelihood
or
a
clear
probability,
had
already
been
applying.
and
in
fact,
this
understanding
was
completely
borne
out,
if
there
could
have
been
any
doubt
in
1968
itself,
this
understanding
that
the
phrase
was
exactly
the
same
was
borne
out
by
the
administrative
practice
over
the
next
12
years
because
no
court,
after
accession
to
the
protocol
in
1968,
held
that
the
substantive
standard
had
in
any
way
been
changed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
no.
we
think
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
whether
congress,
in
adhering
to
the
protocol
in
1968,
or
in
passing
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
intended
in
any
way
by
using
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear"
as
a
substitute
for
prior
phrases
to
change
the
substantive
standard
that
the
board
and
the
court
should
follow
in
applying--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
in
part
that
is
correct,
and
as
i
am
saying,
by
adhering
to
the
protocol
which
included
the
phrase
1968,
we
think
congress
was
obviously
saying
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear"
is
the
equivalent.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
exactly,
exactly,
and
in
fact,
during
the
years
1968
to
1980,
the
courts
and
the
board
used
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear
of
persecution"
as
a
synonym,
as
a
shorthand
phrase
for
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
problem
is...
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is
now
the
standard
under
the
refugee
act.
the
question
is
whether
that
means
something
different.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
question
is
whether
that
means
something
different,
and
we
think
congress
explicitly--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
it
did
because
it--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
failed
to
give
any...
what
it
said
was
that
the
way
that
the
board
and
the
courts
had
been
applying
that
standard
was
erroneous,
and
it
failed
to
tell
the
board
what
the
new
content
of
that
standard
is
other
than
to
say
it
is
something
less
than
what
you
had
been
doing
up
until
now.
at
the
moment
the
board
doesn't...
isn't
quite
sure
what
the
correct
standard
is
in
light
of
the
second
circuit's
decision.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
true.
the
board
though,
early
on,
has
held...
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute...
that
the
1253(h)
relief
is
available
to
people
who
would
meet
the
definition
of
refugee,
so
that
someone
who--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
because
if
you
can
show
a
well-founded
fear,
then
you
would
be
entitled
to
asylum
relief,
for
example,
under
section
208
of
the
act,
and
since
withholding
of
deportation
relief
is
a
lesser
remedy
than
granting
asylum,
it
seems
logical
that
congress
couldn't
have
meant
to
deport
someone
who
would
be
in...
who
would
have...
meet
the
eligibility
standard
under
section
208
for
asylum.
there
is
no
real
dispute
as
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
you
have
to
be
in
the
country
or
at
a
land
border.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
or
port
of
entry
to
get
asylum.
if
you
are
overseas,
you
apply
for
refugee
relief
under
section
207
of
the
act,
which
also
includes
this
well-founded
fear
line
which
we
think...
the
standard
is
the
same
for
all
through,
although
under
section
207
and
208,
there
is
an
additional
discretionary
aspect
to
relief.
that
brings
us
up
to
1980
because
we
think
it
is
clear
that
until
1980,
at
least,
the
standard
was
exactly
the
same.
now,
the
second
essential
part
of
our
test,
then,
is
that
when
congress
passed
the
refugee
act
in
1980,
it
again
did
so
on
the
expressed
and
often-repeated
understanding
that
it
was
not
intending
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
the
law.
the
phrase
1968
by
acceding
to
the
protocol.
let
me
run
through
this
one
more
time
because
we
think
these
two
steps
completely
resolve
the
respondent's
claim
in
this
case.
prior
to
1968,
as
i
said,
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
what
the
correct
standard
was.
there
is
no
claim
on
the
part
of
respondent
or
the
second
circuit
that
the
board
and
the
courts
were
applying
an
incorrect
standard.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
did
feel
that.
we
think
they
were--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right,
but
the
initial
premise
is
completely
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
one
of
the
problems
that
i
think...
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
second
circuit
had
so
much
trouble
with
this
case,
and
understanding
some
of
the
concepts,
i
should
add,
is
that
this
issue
was
never
briefed
to
the
second
circuit.
it
was
raised,
really,
in
the
first
time
in
mr.
stevic's
reply
brief
in
the
second
circuit,
and
therefore,
the
second
circuit
delved
into
this
fairly
complicated
area
of
the
law
without
any
help
from
briefing
from
the
parties.
the
one
case
that
they
relied
on,
the
matter
of
tan,
to
justify
their
assertion
that
203(a)(7)
relief
wa
different
than
243(h)
relief,
we
think
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
is
clearly
erroneous
and
distinguishable.
that
was
the
only
board
case
that
they
relied
on.
so
in
any
event,
in
1968
we
acceded
to
the
protocol
on
the
express
understanding
that
there
was
no
change
in
our
substantive
law,
and
in
1980
we
incorporated
the
language
of
the
protocol
into
the
statute
for
the
first
time,
again
only
for
the
purposes
of
clarity
so...
not
to...
once
again
not
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
the
law.
so
if
the
protocol
did
not
change
the
law
in
1968,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
congress,
by
using
the
same
phrases,
putting
it
into
the
law
in
1980
for
the
purposes
of
clarity,
as
they
said,
could
be
taken
to
have
changed
the
substantive
standard.
and
we
think
that
the
second
circuit's
contrary
conclusion
can
really
only
be
described
as
a
form
of
judicial
alchemy.
here
you
have
congress
repeatedly
saying
each
time
it
tinkers
with
some
statutory
language,
we
don't
mean
to
be
making
any
substantive
change,
and
at
the
end
of
the
process,
the
second
circuit
tells
us
that
the
standard
has
been
completely
overhauled.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
in
the...
i
have
already
read
to
the
court
some
of
the
provisions
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
1968
accession.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
refugee
act
of
1980,
whether
it
intended
to
change
the
substantive
standard
in
this
area
of
the
law.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
well,
but
the
words,
the
key
words
here,
i
assume,
would
be
the
well-founded
fear
language.
those
words
are
not
inherently
meaningful.
they
don't
have
any
inherent
meaning.
they
have
to
be
defined.
congress
has
told
us
how
they...
how
they
mean
to
have
them
defined.
they
mean
to
have
them
defined
by
continuing
the
process
that
the
court
and
the
board
have
used
under
prior
versions
of
the
law.
now,
i
would
not
normally
read
to
the
court
from
legislative
reports,
but
here
the
only
question
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
refugee
act
of
1980
and
in
changing
some
of
the
language
in
section
243(h).
congress,
in
the
reports
that
we
have
reprinted
in
our
brief
at
pages
38
and
39,
has
answered
completely,
we
think,
the
question
before
the
court.
there
is
some...
middle
of
page
138...
this
is
from
the
house
report,
and
i
quote,
the
house
says
243(h),
"has
been
held
by
court
and
administrative
decisions
to
accord
to
aliens
the
protection
required
under
the
protocol,
the
committee
feels
it
is
desirable,
for
the
sake
of
clarity,
toconform
the
language
of
that
section
to
the
protocol
"
now,
here
is
congress
explicitly
saying
with
as
much
clarity
as
i
think
we
can
expect
congress
to
speak,
that
it
recognizes
that
the
courts
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
have
construed
section
243(h)
to
incorporate
the
substance
of
the
protocol,
even
though
the
protocol
uses
this
well-founded
fear
language.
and
here
congress
is
saying
simply
for
the
sake
of
clarity
we
are
going
to
put
the
well-founded
fear
language
into
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
this
was
the
portion
of
the
house
report
that
the
second
circuit
dismissed
as
ambiguous.
we
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
at
all,
and
in
fact,
the
senate
report
which
is
reprinted
at
the
top
of
page
39,
is
even
less
ambiguous.
there
the
senate
is
saying
to
us
"the
substantive
standard
is
not
changed.
"
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
entire
refugee
act
has
respondent
been
able
to
show
even
the
slightest
indication
that
congress
intended
to
change
the
substantive
standard
under
section
243(h)
or
that
it
wanted
to
tinker
with
the
way
the
courts
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
have
been
applying
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
you
would
probably
be
answering
the
same
question
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it
would
be
inappropriate,
i
think,
for
this
court
to
say
that
that
is
what
the
phrase
means
when
congress
when
it
adhered
to
the
protocol
in
1968
said
that
it
wasn't
making
any
change
in
the
law.
in
fact,
let
me
answer
the
question
by
emphasizing
this.
for
respondent
to
prevail
in
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
he
would
have
to
convince
the
court
of
two
things,
both
of
these
things.
first
he
would
have
to
convince
the
court
that
congress
in
1980
meant,
without
saying
so,
to
change
the
substantive
standard
for
section
243(h)
relief.
we
don't
think,
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
stated,
that
respondent
can
meet
that
burden.
but
if
he
could,
let's
assume
that
the
court
were
convinced
that
congress
in
1980
meant
to
put
this
well-founded
fear
language
in
the
statute
as
the
new
standard,
without
any
thought
as
to
what
the
prior
standard
had
been,
then
it
seems
to
us
respondent
would
have
to
convince
the
court
that
the
well-founded
fear
standard
is
a
different
substantive
standard
than
the
one
that
had
previously
been
applied
up
until
1980.
we
don't
think
as
to
that
that
respondent
could
possibly
meet
that
burden
either
because
to
do
so,
to
say
that
the
well-founded
fear
language
is
a
different
substantive
standard
you
would
have
to
ignore
the
following
things.
you
would
have
to
ignore
the
fact
that,
a
i
said
earlier,
the
senate
in
1968
adopted
that
language
on
the
express
understanding
it
wasn't
changing
the
substantive
standard.
you
would
have
to
show...
you
would
have
to
ignore
the
fact
that
from
1968
until
1980
the
board
and
the
reviewing
courts
were
using
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear"
interchangeably
with
the
clear
probability
standard
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it's
not
clear
what
the
handbook
of
procedures
is.
i
mean,
the
handbook
of...
the
handbook
of...
on
procedures
is
in
many
ways
like
the
bible.
you
can
find
support
for
any
proposition.
for
example,
paragraph
45
of
the
handbook
on
procedures
says
that
an
applicant
for
refugee
status
must
normally
show
good
reason
why
he
individually
fears
persecution.
that
seems
top
us
to
sound
very
much
like
the
singling
out--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i'm
not
sure
because--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
not
sure
what
the
handbook
says
the
standard
is.
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
it
seems
to
us,
though,
that
the
handbook
was
written
in
1979.
therefore,
it
can't
inform
what
congress
must
have
meant
when
it
acceded
to
the
protocol
in
1968.
therefore,
we
think
that
for
this
court
to
give
meaning
to
the...
the
protocol
clearly
states,
justice
stevens,
that
there
is...
that
it
is
up
to
each
contracting
state
to
decide
for
itself
what
a
definition
of
refugee
is.
there
is
no
internationally
accepted
definition
of
refugee
that
this
court
could
look
to.
it
is
up
to
each
contracting
state,
here,
the
united
states,
to
decide
what
the
phrase
"well-founded
fear"
means.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
because
i'm
not
sure
that
the
handbook
gives
the
right
answer.
i
think
the
standard
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i'm
not
saying
i
don't
know,
justice
stevens
i
think
that
the
court
does...
should
say
what
the
standard
is,
but
i
think
it
says
that
by
answering
the
question
that
the
standard
has
not
changed
because
congress,
each
time
it
changed
the
language
in
this
area,
specifically
said
we
are
not
meaning
to
change
the
standard.
the
standard
was
quite
clear
prior
to
1968,
and
the
board
and
the
courts
have
been
following
that
same
standard
consistently
until
1983,
except
for
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
the
stevic
case.
so
the
standard
that
i
set
out
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
with
the
subjective
and
objective
test
is
in
fact
the
standard
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
precisely
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
what
we
think
the
relief
should
be.
it
should
go
back
to
the
second
circuit,
which
should
determine--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
standard...
i
don't--
0
[generallaughter.]
the
standard
would
be
clear
at
that
point
if
this
court
agrees
with
us
that
it
hasn't
changed
because
it
was
clear
until--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
yes.
well,
it
thought
it...
it
did
know
what
the
old
standard
was.
it
didn't
tell
us
what
it
thought
the
new
standard
was
other
than
to
say
that
it
is
something
less.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
the
old
standard
is
clear.
it
is
the
standard
that
i
set
out
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
and
it
hasn't
changed,
and
we
think
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case
is
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
second
circuit
to
determine--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--mr.
stevic's
case
under
that--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
and
the
ins
has
done
that
for
certain
categories.
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
with
people
who
are
relying
on
political
opinions
as
the
basis,
as
mr.
stevic
is,
for
withholding
of
deportation,
but
for
example,
the
ins
has
determined
that
members
of
large
religious
groups
in
certain
countries,
for
example,
are
subjected
to
persecution.
we
think,
though,
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
second
circuit
to
determine
whether
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
correctly
determined
mr.
stevic's
second
motion
to
reopen
on
the
basis
of
the
standard
that
we
submit
has
always
been
applied
by
the
courts
and
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
justice
stevens,
the
problem
is
that
the
words
"well-founded
fear
of
persecution",
like
the
phrase
"clear
probability"
and
"realistic
likelihood",
have
no
inherent
meaning.
they
have
no
meaning
in
the
international
scene.
they
have
to
be
given
meaning
by
each
domestic...
each
contracting
state,
and
our
position
is
that
the
board
was
following
a
clear
standard
in
1968,
and
congress,
when
it
acceded
to
the
protocol
which
included
this
well-founded
fear
language,
essentially
said
we
construe
the
phrase
well-founded
fear
to
be
identical
to
the
standard
that
the
courts
and
the
board
were
applying
up
until
then.
so
we
think
that
the
standard
that
was
applicable
prior
to
1968
meets
the
well-founded
fear
language
of
the
protocol.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
of
this
group,
that's
correct.
it
requires
a
case-by-case
determination.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
categorization,
but
in
fair
number,
in
fact,
a
handbook
was
just
put
out
a
few
months
ago
to
deal
with
people
who
are
seeking
refugee
status
from
southeast
asia
which
discusses
at
great
length
the
categories
that
are
entitled
to
refugee
status
as
a
matter
of
law.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
like
just
to
answer
the
question
that
justice
blackmun
put
to
ms.
ritter.
if
this
court
holds,
as
we
think
it
must,
on
the
basis
of
the
1980
legislative
history
that
congress
didn't
mean
to
change
the
standard
in
1980,
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
case.
the
case
will
go
back
to
the
second
circuit
which
will
then
have
to
decide
whether
mr.
stevic
is
entitled
to
withholding
of
deportation
under
the
standard
that
has
been
consistently
applied
for
20
years.
perhaps
he
will
be.
ms.
ritter
has
mentioned
some
of
the
compelling
circumstances,
but
if
mr.
stevic
is
entitled
to
withholding
of
deportation,
it
will
be
because
he
is
able
to
meet
the
showing
as
thousands
and
thousands
of
other
aliens
have
been
able
to
over
the
last
20
years
and
not
because
congress
at
any
time
intended
to
change
the
standard,
all
of
the
evidences
to
the
contrary.
thank
you.
