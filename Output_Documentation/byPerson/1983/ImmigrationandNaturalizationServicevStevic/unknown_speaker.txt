unknown
speaker
aren't
there
clear
probabilities?
unknown
speaker
so
as
long
as
you
don't
assign
any
difference
to
these
words,
difference
in
words,
that's
been
a
consistent
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
standard,
one
use
of
words
might
declare
it
a
minimum
hurdle
and
another
one
declare
something
else.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
objective
test,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
the
objective
test
is
the
one
which
the
board
has
said
was
the
minimum.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
reading
it
out
of
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
has
the
department
ever
indulged
in
any
empirical
evidence
that
would
show
what
has
happened
to
those
who
were
deported
and
denied
relief?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
pre-1968
situation?
unknown
speaker
does...
what's
the
government's
view
as
to
whether
the
same
standard
was
applied
on
deportation
as
on
admission
under--
unknown
speaker
--the
same
standard
under
both.
unknown
speaker
as
under
203(a)--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
protocol?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
the
convention
from
1951
requires
that
the
alien
have
a
well-founded
fear,
that
is,
be
a
refugee,
and
also
that
the
alien's
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened.
do
those
two
phrases
mean
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
so
what
this
case
is
all
about,
in
your
view,
is
how
one
defines
the
term
"well...
founded
fear
of
persecution.
"
unknown
speaker
but
that
in
turn
must
be
decided,
i
suppose,
upon
what
congress
meant
by
using
the
term
"well-founded
fear
of
prosecution".
unknown
speaker
so
the
government's
quarrel
with
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
saying...
is
not
that
opinion
saying
that
the
standard
is
a
well-founded
fear
of
prosecution;
its
quarrel
is
with
the
court's
observation
that
that
standard
is
a
good
deal
more
lenient
than
the
earlier
one.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
what
standard
the
court
of
appeals
said
governed
this
case.
they
said
a
well-founded
fear.
unknown
speaker
sure,
i
agree
with
you.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
leave...
didn't
fail
to
define
what
the
standard
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
did.
it
said
well-founded
fear
is
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
the
statute,
1253(h),
doesn't
use
the
well-founded
fear
language.
unknown
speaker
it
refers
only
to
the
alien's
life
or
freedom
would
be
threatened.
in
fact,
it
doesn't
refer
to
refugees.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
even
though
it
doesn't
say
it
that--
unknown
speaker
--well-founded
fear
is
somehow
incorporated
in
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
can
get
asylum
if
you
are
not
within
the
country,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
at
a
land
border.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
geller,
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
the
second
circuit...
maybe
they
were
wrong...
thought
there
were
two
different
standards
before
'68,
one
for
203(a)(7),
or
whatever
it
is,
and
the
other
for--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
was
sort
of
the
source
of
their
whole
problem.
they
said
we
started
with
two
standard,
and
somewhere
along
the
line
they
must
have
been
combined.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
source
of
their
trouble
according
to
your
view,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
how
did
congress
express
this
view?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
that
absolutely
forecloses
a
court
from
giving
any
different
meaning
to
those
words?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
one
of
the
usual
indica
of
what
congress
means
is
the
words
it
uses
in
the
act
rather
than
a
lot
of
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
in
deciding
this
case,
do
we
have
to
say
what
the
standard
is,
or
do
we
just
have
to
say
it
hasn't
changed?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
say
what
it
is,
do
we...
is
it
the
same
or
different
as
the
one
described
in
the
united
nations
handbook
or
that
handbook
that
is
discussed
at
some
length?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
i
understand
all
that,
but
i
just
really
am
not
sure
i
got
your
answer
to
my
question.
is
the
standard
that
you
say
is
the
correct
one
the
same
or
different
from
the
standard
described
in
the
handbook
of
procedures
that
is
referred
to
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it
is
the
same
standard.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
all
that,
mr.
geller,
but
my
problem
is
i
can
follow
an
argument
very
easily
that
says
the
standard
has
never
changed.
unknown
speaker
then
you
say
yes,
but
you
also
have
to
tell
us
what
the
standard
is.
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
ask
you,
can
i
look
at
the
handbook
to
find
out
what
it
is,
and
i
don't
know
what
your
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
say
you
don't
know,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
suppose
that
if
we
agree
with
you,
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
that,
or
that
as
far
as
we
should
go,
is
that
you
said
the
standard
had
changed
by
the
protocol,
the
refugee
act,
and
you
were
wrong,
it
hasn't
changed.
unknown
speaker
and
remand
the
case.
unknown
speaker
let
them
figure
out
what
the
standard
should
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
thought
it
knew
what
the
old
standard
was.
otherwise
it
couldn't
have
said
it
had
changed.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
tell
them
to
go
back
to
the
old
standard,
they
must
have
known
what
that
was.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--geller,
under
the
old
standard
which
you
think
is
clear--
unknown
speaker
--can
the
united
states
in
meeting
it
establish
whole
countries
or
whole
categories
of
people
that
would
meet
the
standard
without
an
individual
application?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
government
has
not
established
a
categorical
view
of
the
members
of
this
particular
group
from
yugoslavia.
unknown
speaker
and
in
how
many
areas
or
countries
has
the
united
states
established
one
of
these
categories?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
congressional
committees
have
to
say
about
the
change
when
they
made
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
ins
after
'68,
in
view
of
what
congress
had
been...
take
the
position
that
there
had
been
no
change?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
are
not
asking
us
to
apply
the
standard
ourselves,
are
you?
i
mean,
the
second
circuit
didn't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
apply
whatever
standard
we
find
is
applicable
to
the
facts
of
mr.
stevic's
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
all
of
these
facts
that
you
are
describing
meet
the
government's
test
as
applied
before
1968?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
they
could
not
meet
that
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right,
but
do
you
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
show
that
for
mr.
stevic?
unknown
speaker
that
he
would
be
singled
out
for
persecution?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ritter,
if
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
two
standards
are
one
and
the
same,
is
that
the
end
of
your
case?
