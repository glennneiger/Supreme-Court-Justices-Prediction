against
two
local
county
precinct

and
it
involved
the
primary
law
of
the
state
of
texas
and
nobody
has
ever
questioned
the
jurisdiction
until
this
day.

allwright.
and
they
ended
up
by
being
awarded
--

mean
fined
$5
apiece.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
the
state
law
which
was
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
that
case,
and
the
government
not
only
was
not
a
party,
but
when
he
came
up
here,
the
attorney
general
didn't
need
more
the
defendant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but

did
in
that
case.
justice
thurgood

were
found
in
pari
delicto
and

justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
talking
about
their
liabilities
(inaudible),
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
did
you
sue
for
damages?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
liability
that's
still
open?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
i
ask
you,
what
is
now
open
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
--
you're
talking
about
the
order
that's
been
withdrawn.
what
order
--
what
order
is
now
denying
your
people
any
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
--
what
remedy
do
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
an
affirmnce
of
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
one
that's
been
withdrawn?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
that
we
then
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
issue
an
advisory
opinion.
what
else
is
there
but
an
advisory
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we
can
issue
advisory
opinions
then
i
do
not
think
we
can
deal
with
the
court
of
appeals.
