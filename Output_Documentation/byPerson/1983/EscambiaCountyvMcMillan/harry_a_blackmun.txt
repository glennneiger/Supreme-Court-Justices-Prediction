mr.
rhyne,
in
the
same
--
in
the
same
connection,
there
was
a
remedial
order
for
which
we
granted
certiorari
to
review.
that's
now
been
withdrawn,
hasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
been
withdrawn.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
--
isn't
there
a
new
plan
that
the
district
court
ordered?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what's
before
us
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
what's
before
us
then
of
the
order
that
we
(voice

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
can
it
be
if
the
orders
are
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
can
it
be?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
order
is
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
the
order
is
not
here
that
we
agreed
to
review,
how
are
we
going
to
reveal
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
have
to
say
it
for
myself.
it
strikes
me
that
the
whole
thing
is
moot
or
at
least
certainly
premature.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
but
would
--
would
they
have
standing
to
challenge
a
statewide
statute
if
the
local
officials
just
said,
“we're
not
going
to
let
you
vote
because
the
state
law
prohibits.”
