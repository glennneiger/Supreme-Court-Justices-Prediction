mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
prepared
to
--
to
address
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
florida
law
is
clear
that
a
county
has
no
voice,
can
take
no
act
except
as
directed
by
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
in
this
particular
instance,
an
election
was
held.
the
composition
of
the
board
of
the
county
commissioners
has
changed
what
had
previously
been
in
the
unanimous
decision
to
carry
forward
the
appeal
on
this
matter
has
now
changed
and
majority
of
the
board
of
the
county
commissioners
voted
in
a
legal
meeting
to
dismiss
this
appeal.
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
a
yes,
but
it's
a
qualified
yes.
the
former
members,
that
is,
all
five
members
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
and
we
have
a
five-member
system
in
--
in
escambia
county.
they
were
only
in
office
but
for
the
fact
that
the
elections
had
been
staged.
those
elections
probably
would
have
been
heard
or
would
have
been
had
well
before
1983
but
for
the
order.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
on
at-large
basis,
yes,
and
--
and
i
might
point
this
out
to
the
court
that
the
--
all
the
incumbents
ran
on
a
platform
that
was
constituted
of
or
consisted
of
saying
that
they
intended
to
maintain
this
lawsuit
and
all
except
for
one
was
defeated.
the
three
of
the
--
of
the
majority
members,
they
made
a
very
strong
point
that
they
had
had
enough
of
this
lawsuit
and
they
thought
escambia
county
had
and
they
wanted
to
withdraw
it.
now,
i
did
mention
the
majority
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
voted.
florida
does
not
recognize
majority-minority
positions
on
its
board
of
the
county
commissioners.
there
is
one
position
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
majority
must,
but
the
board
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
yes,
sir,
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
florida
law
is
--
is
clear
that
an
individual
member
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
has
no
authority.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
is.
there
is
--
there
is
a
vehicle.
there
is
a
legal
means
by
which
this
election
can
be
attacked.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
position
we're
at
now,
with
all
the
parties
being
realigned
or
misaligned,
i
don't
think
that
the
correct
pleadings
are
before
this
court
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
as
mr.
menefee
said,
i
hate
to
go
into
the
--
to
use
that
term
mootness.
i'm
just
concerned
about
the
underlying
court
decisions
or
what
effect
it
may
have
if
this
court
or
if
--
if
we
were
to
urge
it
to
dismiss
as
moot.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
the
--
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
the
persons
that
attempting
to
maintain
the
suit
do
not
have
the
requisite
interest
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
justice
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
justice
white
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
but
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
well,
i'm
--
i'm
bound
by
what
the
judge
found
and
--
and
what
it
is
--
is
in
the
record
and
as
--
as
you'd
probably
note
in
the
supplemental
brief
as
filed
by
the
appellees,
there
was
an
excerpt
from
judge
arnold's
order
and
he
stated
that
his
only
reason
for
keeping
them
in
there
was
not
for
any
liability
that
they
face
as
far
as
costs,
attorney's
fees
or
any
individual
liability.
he
only
left
them
in,
in
order
that
he
could
enforce
his
injunctions
against
them
personally
in
the
event
that
the
board
of
county
commissioner
was
to
take
a
position
contrary
to
his
orders.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
correct,
however
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
i
do
believe
the
--
the
mootness
issue
was
--
was
addressed
in
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
it's
worth
--
we're
tired
of
the
lawsuit,
in
other
words,
and
we
want
to
withdraw.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that's
correct.
i
don't
want
to
go
--
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
i
represent
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
but
we're
saying
that
they
do
not
have
the
requisite
interest
in
this
particular
case
to
--
to
force
the
county
to
--
to
keep
pursuing
the
appeal.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
i
believe
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
a
remand
may
be
the
correct
vehicle
in
order
to
--
there
are
some
factual
assertions
have
been
made
through
the
supplemental
briefs
and
that
may
be
(inaudible)
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
he
has
named
commissioner
dixon,
commissioner
kelson
and
he
represents
also
certain
former
members
of
the
--
the
board
of
county
commissioners.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
i
believe
he
did
state
their
position,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
r.
santurri
thank
you,
chief
justice,
i
appreciate
this
--
