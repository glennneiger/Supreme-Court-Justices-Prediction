justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
--
mr.
rhyne,
supposing
that
the
state
of
florida
had
a
one
year
durational
residence
requirement
in
order
to
vote
which
this
court
has
held
as
unconstitutional
and
someone
went
to
escambia
county
and
registered
to
vote
without
having
qualified
for
the
one
year
and
was
totally
couldn't
register.
couldn't
he
sue
the
registrar
in
escambia
county
claiming
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
whatever
it
is,
right
to
travel
without
joining
the
government
of
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
takes
a
lot
of
our
cases
involving
county
officials
where
they
have
been
defendants
and
charged
with
violating
people's
constitutional
rights
have
involved
them
administering
state
statutes

mr.

mr.

mr.
rhyne
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
this
argument,
as
i
understood
the
response,
goes
only
to
whether
this
is
a
proper
appeal
or
whether
instead
it's
a
certiorari.
again,
it
--
it
doesn't
touch
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
think
all
of
us
hope
you
will
get
to
the
merits
pretty
soon.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
rejection,
mr.
menefee,
rejection
by
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
--
you
say
that
the
record
supports
to
find
that
the
reason
for
their
--
for
their
rejection
is
recommendation
was
racially
motivated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
1980
redistricting
was
--
in
--
in
the
adoption
of
the
single-member
district
under
1980
plan
was
under
somewhat
of
the
force
of
the
district
court's
order
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
protect
the
entrenched
majority,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
spent
some
time
in
this
that
several
of
the
commissioners
voted
against
the
new
plan
because
of
their
desire
to
preserve
their
incumbency.
i
--
i
didn't
see
that
that
was
necessarily
a
racial
factor
at
all.
i
mean
they
might
well
have
wanted
to
preserve
their
incumbency
against
blacks
or
whites.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
can't
remember
which,
puts
some
weight
in
putting
together
the
discriminatory
calculus
on
the
fact
that
they
thought
the
--
the
commissioners
were
against
the
plan
for
single-member
districts
because
the
commissioners
wanted
to
hang
on
to
their
jobs.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
for
the
present
majority,
is
it
owes
its
office
to
the
--
the
fact
that
the
court
imposed
the
single-member
district
plan,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
an
at-large?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
well
what
--
what
you
say
will
--
would
make
a
great
deal
more
sense
to
me
if
you're
talking
about
an
orthodox
appeal
where
the
county,
say,
had
a
money
judgment
against
them
or
do
we
appeal
from
the
district
court
of
the
eleventh
circuit?
do
we
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida?
and
then
a
new
group
of
commissioners
is,
like
they
say,
this
lawsuit
just
isn't
worth
what
it's
cost
us.
let's
give
up
the
appeal.
surely,
the
--
the
county
ought
to
have
the
final
say
in
that.
but
here,
in
effect,
if
the
principle
you're
contending
for
is
correct,
the
district
court
could
impose
a
perfectly
outrageous
redistricting
plan
on
escambia
county,
put
it
into
effect,
the
new
commissioners
all
come
into
office
by
virtue
of
that
plan.
when
they
get
in,
they
vote
to
abandon
the
appeal.
so
that
in
effect,
the
district
court's
judgment
is
never
reviewable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
--
you're
not
--
your
--
your
position
as
i
understand,
isn't
that
it's
moot,
it's
that
you
are
the
party
that
said
that
one
time
you
represent
the
party
that
sought
the
challenge
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit's
judgment.
your
client
has
not
changed
its
mind.
it
no
longer
wants
to
challenge
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
mean
it's
moot.
it
just
means
you
want
to
give
up
the
--
the
petition.
