justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rhyne,
i
noticed
that
argument
in
your
reply
brief.
i
wonder
supposing
the
--
florida
had
a
statute
that
said
no
one
except
whites
can
vote
and
suddenly
a
black
citizen
wanted
to
vote
in
escambia
and
they
didn't
let
him.
they
sued
the
local
officials.
could
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
unconstitutional.
well,
they
contend
this
is
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
maybe
they
are
wrong
but
your
argument
is
that
they
must
sue
the
governor
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
in
this
case
and
not
the
one
i
hypothesized?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
rhyne,
suppose
the
--
say,
we
study
this
out
very
carefully
based
on
your
brief,
and
i
am
very
interested
getting
--
listening
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
were
found
expressly
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
said
that
wasn't
so.
so
that
was
inconsistent
in
--
in
--
with
the
manner
in
which
the
county
commission
actually
operates.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
--
where
do
we
suppose
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
district
court
did
say,
and
i
quote
him,
“does
--
that
this
position,
your
position,
does
not
stand
four-square
with
the
present
operation
of
the
commission
in
its
business.”
that's
what
the
district
court
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
this
--
the
--
the
--
this
explanation
for
at-large
elections,
the
district
court
said,
“does
not
stand
four-square
with
the
present
operation
of
the
commission
on
its
business.”
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
do
something
with
that
finding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
they
had
to
prove?
that's
all
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
the
district
court
withdraw
its
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
think
there's
anything
left
to
the
case?
i
mean
i'm
not
just
talking
just
the
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
you
say
liability,
why
is
there
anything
left
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
if
this
--
if
we
disagree
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
said
there
was
no
intention
for
discrimination,
never
should
have
been
an
--
this
establishment
of
the
at-large
election
system,
the
new
election
would
be
beside
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
how
can
the
three
new
commissioners
are
a
product
of
what
--
what
he's
claiming
to
have
been
an
illegal
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
an
illegal
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
menefee,
you
just
said
section
2
issue
would
--
would
remain,
since
the
court
of
appeals
never
addressed
the
section
2
issue,
am
i
correct?
it
did
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
the
--
the
single-member
district
system
to
stay
in
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
lose
this
case,
it
may
not
stay
in
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you're
back
to
square
one.
you're
back
to
square
one
when
you
started
this
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
case
is
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
--
i
think
if
you
--
you're
going
to
say
it's
moot,
why,
we
would
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
entire
case.
and
if
the
case
isn't
moot,
i
don't
know
what
business
we
got
in
dismissing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
--
didn't
the
district
court
--
aren't
the
individual
--
the
individual
commissioners,
all
commissioners
were
parties
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
maintained
in
their
individual
capacity,
not
just
their
official
capacity.
those
two
are
still
members
of
this
--
still
parties
to
this
lawsuit,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
apparently
somebody
like
the
district
judge
thought
they
had
an
interest
in
their
individual
capacity,
wholly
aside
from
their
position
as
commissioners.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
hasn't
he
got
a
--
haven't
that
--
those
two
got
a
--
got
some
interests
in
having
the
injunction
that
was
outstanding
against
them
lifted?
i
would
and
you
--
i
would
take
you
wouldn't
like
to
be
under
some
injunction
that
--
that
it'd
illegal,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
--
why
--
why
is
the
case
moot
then?
if
you
want
to
say
it's
moot,
you
got
to
say
it's
moot.
then
we
can
--
to
get
--
really
get
rid
of
these
judgments.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you
want
--
all
you
want
is
dismiss
the
appeal
of
this
court
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let
stand
everything
that
had
happened
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
--
if
that's
really
an
issue.
i
suppose
we
can
remand
this
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
--
for
--
for
two
or
three
reasons.
one,
to
consider
your
point,
first.
secondly,
if
it's
--
that
there's
still
no
live
case
to
consider,
reconsider
the
matter
under
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
couldn't
solve
it,
it
would
have
to
be
remand
this
to
the
district
court.
