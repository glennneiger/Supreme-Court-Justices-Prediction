mr.
rhyne
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
can
i
--
can
i
interrupt
with
a
--
with
a
question?
what
do
you
understand
the
constitutional
issue
to
be?
is
it
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
no,
let
me
--
let
me
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
put
it
a
little
differently.
well,
i
understand
it.
what
do
you
suppose
the
case
turns
on?
does
it
turn
on
whether
one
or
more
members
of
the
commission,
adds
the
wrong
kind
of
motivation?
is
that
the
whole
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
they
have
to
prove
to
win
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
what
do
they
have
to
prove
to
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
do
--
do
you
think
they
just
had
to
prove
adverse
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
adverse
effect
on
their
voting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
all
they
had
to
prove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
theory
of
the
case
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
is
what
i'm
saying,
and
i'm
trying
to
--
first,
to
understand
what
you
understand
their
burden
to
be.
what
did
they
have
to
prove
in
order
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
racial
reasons
held
by
whom?
you
say
i
take
it
the
state's
racial
reasons
would
be
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
by
that
you
mean
the
five
commissioners
or
the
voters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
said
they
had
to
prove
that
there
was
discriminatory
anomies
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
all
five
commissioners,
three
commissioners
or
one
commissioner.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
know
what
the
voting
was.
does
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
anybody
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
subjective,
subjective,
the
actual
motivation
of
any
individual,
does
that
make
any
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
it's
your
position
that
there
was
no
adverse,
no
wrongful
motivation.
i
am
just
trying
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
to
understand
what
your
legal
theory
is
as
respects
what
they
had
to
prove
in
order
to
prevail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
proved
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
and
if
they
proved
that,
are
they
entitled
to
prevail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
means
we
don't
have
to
examine
the
motivation
of
the
county
commissioners
if
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
i
understand
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
you
to
be
conceding
they
don't
have
to
prove
any
in
escambia
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
--
it
seems
to
me
you
have
given
me
two
or
three
different
answers
to
it.
do
they
or
do
they
not
have
to
prove
that
members
of
the
country
commission
were
prejudiced
against
black
citizens?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
have
to
prove
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
many
commissioners
do
they
have
to
prove
with
that
kind
of
motivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
--
may
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
people
voted
against
the
--
who
participated
in
this
decision
from
the
commission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
establish
your
case
to
prove
that
two
people
had
the
wrong
kind
of
motivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
one
of
them
came
in
and
frankly
testified
that
he
wanted
to
preserve
white
supremacy
in
the
--
in
the
county.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
it
would
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
interpret
the
district
court
having
found
anything
more
than
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
--
you
contend,
if
i
understand
your
brief
correctly,
that
even
if
none
of
the
five
had
the
wrong
kind
of
motive,
that's
still,
the
state
practices
were
sufficient
to
condemn
the
plan.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
very
--
very
frankly,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
when
we
say
there's
an
invidious
purpose,
whose
purpose
we're
talking
about
and
how
much
--
how
many
people
we
have
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
i
think
the
law
is
unclear
and
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
record
in
this
case
is
and
what
the
parties
are
contending,
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
to
refresh
my
recollection.
is
there
a
residency
requirement
in
the
--
with
the
five
--
the
commissioners
just
--
or
just
the
numbered
polls?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
--
a
sort
of
an
inconsistency
between
running
a
government,
say,
it's
a
community-wide
thing
and
also
a
local
district?
is
there
any
explanation
of
why
they
have
that
specific
combination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
the
--
during
the
period
that
the
white
primary
was
enforced,
primary
with
voting
was
--
was
that
by
district
or
at-large?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
is
you
don't
to
represent
the
two
individual
commissioners.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
well
and
we
have
two
individual
commissioners
who
are
parties
in
their
own
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
your
opinion,
whom
does
mr.
rhyne
represent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
certainly
made
it
clear.
he
thinks
there's
something
he
wants
to
fight
about
still.
