--
if
the
district
court
only
found
that
the
commissioners
failed
to
recommend
the
single-member
district
plan
to
the
voters,
why
should
the
remedy
by
the
court
be
anything
other
than
telling
him
to
submit
it
to
the
voters?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
offense
was
simply
not
submitting
it
to
the
voters,
i
don't
know
why
the
remedy
wouldn't
flow
from
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happened
in
the
most
recent
election
under
the
new
plan?
was
a
black
elected?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
case
now
moot
because
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
district
court
order
in
your
view?
