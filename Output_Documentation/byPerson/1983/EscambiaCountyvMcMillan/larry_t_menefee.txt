mr.
larry
t.
menefee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case.
there
are
two
substantive
issues
one
involving
decision
on
liability
and
the
second
is
involving
the
decision
on
the
remedy.
first,
concerning
the
decision
on
liability,
we
contend
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
under
the
doctrine
of
(inaudible)
and
rule
52
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
district
court
made
an
intentionally
local
appraisal
was
--
and
the
district
judge
lived
in
the
community.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
concluded
that
the
at-large
election
system
had
both
the
purpose
and
effect
of
deluding
black
voting
strength
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
district
court
had
before
it
substantial
evidence
which
in
summary
showed
the
following.
first,
historically,
the
election
structure
had
been
manipulated
at
every
opportunity
to
minimize
black
participation.
second,
the
two
charter
study
committees
in
1975
and
1977,
which
has
been
referred
to
in
mr.
rhyne's
statement,
had
both
made
recommendations
for
single-member
districts
and
the
rejection
of
those
recommendations
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
the
delusion
of
black
voting
strength.
third
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
county
commission
rejected
the
recommendations
of
the
charter
study
commissions.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
we
believe
that
--
yes.
the
--
the
district
judge's
conclusion
that
that
motivation
was
infected
with
discriminatory
anomies
is
supported.
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
it's
my
understanding
that
both
times
it
was
a
unanimous
decision
by
the
county
commission.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
believe
under
existing
case
law,
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
more
than
one
person?
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
don't
believe
the
district
court
is
clear
how
many.
i
don't
believe
it
identified
the
number
of
actors.
i
believe
it
did
identify
the
actors
and
i
believe
it
did
it
in
a
contextual
sense
of
a
long
history
of
similar
decisions
being
made
in
regard
to
county
government
in
particular
and
other
contemporary
events
that
the
district
judge
lived
in
that
community
and
saw
with
regard
to
the
city
government
change
and
of
the
school
board
change
that
also
took
place
at
the
same
time.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
it
would
be.
and
if
i'd
misunderstood
your
question
from
the
beginning,
i
felt
the
question
was
what
was
shown
and
i
believe
it
was
shown
-
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
these
purposes
how
much
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
it
is
a
continued
maintenance
of
the
at-large
election
system.
it
was
not
merely
a
failure.
it
was
indeed
a
rejection
or
overturning
if
you
will.
that
would
be
the
way
i
would
refer
to
cast
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
justice
o'connor,
i
think
what
it
--
what
it
shows
and
putting
--
in
this
long
historical
record
that
is
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
believe
has
been
in
another
case
before
this
court.
every
time
the
elections
--
there
was
an
opportunity
for
blacks
to
participate
in
the
election
system,
the
system
changed
to
minimize
their
participation.
this
is
the
most
recent
example.
putting
that
context,
this
was
a
continued
maintenance
of
the
discriminatory
system.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
in
fort
--
a
black
was
elected
for
the
first
time
in
recorded
history.
six
black
candidates
sought
election.
a
150%
more
than
it
had
ever
sought
election
to
escambia
county
commission
in
all
of
history.
it
was
a
significantly
different
election.
voter
turn
--
black
voter
turn
out
was
(inaudible)
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
believe
the
remedy
issue
is
probably
moot.
i
had
little
concern
about
the
--
using
the
precise
term.
i
believe
the
remedy
issue
is
moot.
i
believe
the
liability
issue
is
alive
with
the
exception
of
the
pending
motion
for
dismissal.
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
--
don't
think
that
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
no,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i'm
sorry
the
district
court.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
district
court
found
liability
under
the
unamended
section
2.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
and
on
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
never
addressed
the
statutory
and
only
found
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
the
--
well
there's
a
long
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
about
why
they
would
not
ask
for
further
briefs
to
address
the
--
the
recently
amended
section
2
claim.
and
quite
candidly,
this
case
is,
perhaps,
in
some
way
almost
a
dinosaur.
i
mean,
the
amended
section
2
is
not
here.
i
really
believe
that
what
this
court
is
going
to
see
in
the
future
will
be
cases
coming
under
the
amended
section
2.
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
your
honor,
yes,
we
believe
the
courts
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
we
have
not
briefed
it
and
we
filed
our
complaint
under
section
2
and
we
believe
the
amended
section
2
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
it's
--
it's
--
we
would
prevail
on
that
whether
this
court
wants
to
consider
it
or
whether
if
you
want
further
briefing
and
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
address
that
issue
now,
but
i
think
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
no,
sir,
i
just
meant
that
the
initial
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
don't
believe
--
no,
in
my
opening
statement,
i
only
meant
to
address
a
violation
or
not
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
before
this
court
is
that
question
of
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
violated
and
whether
or
not
the
at-large
election
system
denies
equal
protection
of
law.
we
believe
the
remedy
issue
is
moot.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
--
the
order
that
i
understand
is
before
the
court
is
the
judgment
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
reached
both
the
liability
and
remedy.
and
we
think
subsequent
events
have
mooted
the
remedy
question.
we
think
the
remedy
issue
--
the
liability
issue
is
still
before
the
court.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
we
want
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
affirmance
from
--
and
continuation
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
of
the
district
--
of
the
district
court's
remedial
order,
the
district
court's
remedial
--
the
district
court's
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
we
are
affirming
--
i'm
sorry,
we're
affirming
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
--
is
where
we
stand.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
--
because
of
the
subsequent
--
i
--
i
hate
to
use
that
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
--
the
term
moot
is
maybe
slightly
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
--
technical
but
i'm
willing
to
go.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
no,
your
honor.
it
did
not
withdraw
its
order.
it
was
--
as
i
--
it
wasn't
even
--
before
the
district
court
to
withdraw
in
that
sense,
the
1980
census
came
out,
a
new
district
in
plan
had
to
be
fashioned.
the
county
commissioners
submitted
another
plan.
a
new
plan
had
different
boundaries,
was
considered
and
rejected.
the
five-two
plan
was
rejected
for
different
reasons
and
the
reasons
that
are
before
the
court
for
this
and
it's
presently
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes
--
yes,
i'm
only
cautious,
perhaps.
i
--
on
the
remedy
issue,
i
don't.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
think
--
well,
i
think
this
court
could
determine
--
i
think
this
court
could
determine
that
the
decision
below
is
erroneous.
they
accepted
all
of
the
arguments
and
vacated
all
of
the
orders
below
and
order
reestablishment
of
the
at-large
election
system.
now,
that
does
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
appeal
can
be
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
--
maintained
by
the
two
minority
members
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that's
--
that's
correct.
the
section
2
issue
would
still
remain.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that's
correct.
after
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
opinion
and
the
mandate
issued,
now
the
court
of
--
the
district
court
asked
for
new
plans
in
light
of
the
1980
census
and
for
schedule.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
--
well
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir,
i
--
without
quibbling
over
illegality
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
--
term,
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
--
i
guess
that
would
be
their
position.
i
don't
want
to
argue
this
case
on
--
but
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
we
believe
the
case
is
so
strong,
we'd
be
glad
for
you
to
go
ahead
and
rule
in
our
favor
on
the
constitutional
issue,
but
certainly
that
is
a
common
--
i
understand
a
common
practice.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
well,
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
--
what
i
understand.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
because
of
the
established
practice
of
desiring
a
decision
on
statutory
rather
than
constitutional
grounds
that
--
that
may
warrant
that
practice.
the
other
principal
evidentiary
facts
that
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
if
you
reversed
on
constitutional
order
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that's
right,
sir.
continuing
with
the
list
of
the
evidentiary
factors
that
are
in
this
record,
there's
a
massive
record
of
racially
polarized
voting.
it
is
my
best
judgment
that
over
200,000
groups
of
data
were
entered
into
the
computer
for
the
168
regression
analysis.
no
black
has
ever
won
election
to
the
escambia
county
until
the
elections
this
past
fall
under
the
single-member
district
plan.
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
socioeconomic
disparity
between
black
and
white
citizens.
there
are
evidence
of
significant
barriers
to
black
candidate
recruitment,
black
voter
turnout,
and
black
political
participation.
also
the
system
features
numbered
place
and
majority
vote
requirements
which
have
no
rational
basis
other
than
to
protect
the
entrenched
majority
briefly
address
the
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
don't
think
that
factor
standing
is
that
--
i
agree
with
you
in
the
--
to
that
extent,
justice
rehnquist.
that
statement
of
i
want
to
protect
my
incumbency,
i
can't
say
that
that
is
racially
motivated.
i
think
the
problem
the
district
court
found
is
that
the
statements
were
inconsistent.
they
did
not
stand
four-square
with
the
operation
of
the
county.
it
wasn't
a
very
credible
performance.
so
that
was
their
proffered
reasons
were
disbelieved.
the
district
court
had
not
only
the
testimony
of
those
four
commissioners.
members
of
those
charter
government
study
committees
testified.
the
transcripts
of
public
hearings
were
before
the
district
judge
and
the
final
reports
of
those
study
committees
were
there.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
well,
that
factor
is
discussed
i
believe
in
both
opinions,
prominently
also
in
the
district
court
opinion,
but
i
know
--
i
don't
believe
--
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
don't
think
any
--
either
of
the
courts
equated
the
desire
to
maintain
incumbency
with
a
--
with
that
direct
ratio.
it's
not
a
straight
linear
--
linear
equation,
if
you
will,
with
racial
analysis.
it
is
a
contextual
thing
of
the
incredible
testimony
or
lack
of
credible
testimony
that
the
commissioners
gave
their
testimony
from
the
other
witnesses
that
took
the
stand
that
were
served
on
this
committee,
of
written
reports,
the
public
transcripts,
the
actions
taking
place
in
the
city
and
the
school
board
near
the
same
time,
a
long
historical
evidence
and
then
the
whole
line
of
indicia
that
the
court
considered
in
rogers
v.
lodge.
the
--
the
line
of
indicia
that's
come
down
from
--
from
white,
white
we
registered
through
rogers
v.
lodge,
the
polarized
voting,
black
to
black
candidates,
socioeconomic
disparity
and
--
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
all
of
that's
in
this
record,
plus
this
historical,
both,
if
you
will,
ancient
historical
and
contemporary
evidence
of
intent.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
the
--
oh,
yes,
sir.
i
see,
but
yes
there
was
a
residency.
there
was
a
residency
requirement
attached
with
the
at-large
system.
they
had
five
residency
sub-districts.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
--
not
in
the
record.
the
--
the
only
explanation
i've
ever
heard
is
--
has
--
has
been
referred
to
an
opinion
so
everybody
can
live
in
the
same
block,
but
that's
the
very
inconsistency
that
the
district
judge
focused
on
when
he
heard
these
commissioners
talk
about
how
they'd
go
back
into
their
district
and
they
called
it
their
district
and
see
about
their
neighbors'
road
and
repair
this
bridge
or
what
have
you.
and
then
run
at-large
and
take
an
oath
under
the
florida
constitution
to
represent
the
entire
county.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
that
on
--
as
the
district
court
called
it
anomalous
situation
from
approximately
the
turn
of
the
century,
after
all
the
--
most
of
the
disenfranchising
devices
had
taken
effect.
blacks
were
removed
from
the
electorate.
then
they
went
to
the
situation
where
the
all-white
democratic
primary
was
conducted
from
single-member
districts.
but
the
general
election
which,
in
my
part
of
the
country
didn't
mean
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
back
then,
was
conducted
at-large.
they'd
let
black
folks
vote
in
the
general
election,
but
not
in
the
single-member
district
democratic
primary
which
it
was
the
effective,
the
election
that
really
counted.
there
are
three
principal
historical
era
--
eras,
if
you
will.
from
the
civil
war
to
the
turn
of
the
century,
blacks
were
allowed
to
vote.
they
were
registered
and
in
some
north
florida
counties,
constituted
a
majority
of
the
voters.
the
fear
of
perhaps
black
getting
elected
and
holding
a
county
commissioner
or
school
board
office,
they
didn't
even
hold
elections
then.
they
had
them
by
gubernatorial
appointment
because
the
state
of
florida
was
majority
white.
then
once
blacks
were
disenfranchised,
at
the
turn
of
the
century,
they
went
to
this
anomalous
system
of
single-member
district
primary
elections
and
at-large
general
elections.
then
world
war
ii,
veterans
returned,
black
veterans
returned
and
want
to
participate
in
government,
smith,
the
all
rights
strikes
down,
the
all--white
democratic
primary
and
the
rules
of
the
game
are
changed
again.
this
time
they
abolished
the
single-member
district
democratic
primaries
and
go
to
the
at-large
democratic
primaries.
so
that
--
those
three
major
historical
shifts,
put
in
the
context
with
the
manipulation,
if
you
will,
of
these
charter
government
study
committee
reports,
the
very
specific
contemporary
evidence
of
a
similar
change
in
the
city
of
pensacola
government
in
1959
and
the
school
board
of
escambia
county
in
1976,
that's
the
contextual
arena
that
the
district
judge
had
to
--
made
this
finding
(inaudible)
and
that
doesn't
even
touch
the
polarized
voting
and
lack
of
black
candidates,
no
blacks
having
ever
been
elected,
the
other
factors
that
this
court
has
referred
to
in
other
opinions.
the
--
i
would
note
some
of
the
other
evidence
in
the
record.
i've
mentioned
the
substantial
record
on
polarized
voting
approximately
168
regression
analysis,
not
only
did
that
measure
a
polarized
voting
and
produced
scattered
diagrams
for
all
of
those
elections,
we
also
ran
a
test
to
measure
voter
turnout.
this
was
confirmed
by
other
studies
and
it
showed
that
blacks
turn
out
at
a
rate
of
approximately
half
that
of
white
voters
and
this
we
think
is
a
significant
measure
of
black
political
participation.
it's
one
thing
to
have
a
voter
registration
drive
to
urge
people
to
go
down
and
get
their
names
into
polls,
but
the
degree
that
people
are
hooked
into
the
political
system,
the
degree
that
they
vote
and
participate
--
political
scientists
call
it
political
socialization.
i
grew
up
in
a
house
where
my
parents
sat
around
the
table
and
we'd
talk
politics
and
you
had
a
duty
to
go
vote.
that's
essentially
the
kind
of
institution
that
has
not
been
present,
as
present
in
the
black
community
and
it
hasn't
been
present
because
blacks
haven't
been
seeking
office
or
candidates
who
addressed
the
interest
of
black
citizens
haven't
been
seeking
office.
and
we
did
run
tests
on
some
white
candidates
who
had
--
generally
they
were
presidential
candidates
or
outside
of
escambia
county
jurisdiction.
the
same
phenomena
occurs.
in
many
cases,
black
voters
will
go
to
the
poll
and
if
there's
a
candidate
that
has
addressed
their
interests,
they
will
vote
in
that
race.
but
contrary
to
the
behavior
of
most
white
voters,
they
would
not
pull
the
lever
on
all
those
other
races
that
are
on
the
ballot.
and
that's
what
these
social
scientists
or
whatever
talking
about
in
terms
of
political
socialization.
how
involved
are
you
in
the
system
and
you
had
the
opportunity
to
work
on
a
campaign
or
get
involved
with
and
see
that
your
interests
are
at
stake.
it's
like,
i
believe,
justice
marshall
referred
to
in
bolden
v.
city
of
mobile
casting
meaningless
ballots
and
i'm
afraid
that
that's
the
way
most
of
the
black
voters
in
escambia
county,
florida
view
their
situation
under
the
at-large
situation.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
absolutely
not,
absolutely
not.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
i
--
i
don't
know
the
exact
figure,
but
no,
it's
a
small
--
small
portion
of
population.
i
think
less
than
1%
or
2%.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
problems.
with
the
disclaimer,
that's
not
part
of
our
case,
but
--
but
proceeding
beyond
that
to
address
it,
yes,
sir.
certainly,
mexican-american
citizens,
like
all
citizens,
can
assert
a
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
formulating
a
remedy,
i
think
this
court
has
wisely
adopted
the
policy
of
favoring
single-member
districts.
it's
a
--
it's
a
simple
straightforward
method.
if
there
are
residential
concentrations,
if
it
has
been
shown
that
mexican-americans
have
been
excluded
from
the
political
process
over
a
period
of
time,
substantial
period
of
time,
we're
not
talking
about
an
episodic
event
that
occurs
once.
i'm
not
talking
about
(inaudible),
then
yes,
if
it
--
if
the
--
and
if
they'd
state
a
claim,
i
mean
if
they'd
come
forward
and
--
and
joined
in
the
litigation,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
full
range
of
your
hypothetical,
justice
powell.
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
section
2
has
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
those
are
difficult
questions
and
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
to
be
--
mr.
larry
t.
menefee
today,
thank
goodness.
section
2
does
have
either
standard
purpose
or
effect.
so
you
--
you
can
prevail
under
either
standard
under
section
--
under
the
amended
section
2.
but
i
think
the
fundamental
question
is
found,
effective
representation.
and
as
this
court
has
had
to
deal
with
since
baker
versus
carr,
and
reynolds
versus
sims,
stay
on
effect
of
representation
is,
in
those
cases
focused
on
numerical
figure
of
maximum
deviation
from
an
ideal
district.
now,
every
citizen
has
a
right
to
that
and
it
is
just
as
possible
to
gerrymander
districts
by
having
one
giant
district,
having
five
smaller
districts
or
even
as
one
plan
that
was
submitted
and
i
think
later
withdrawn
early
in
this
litigation
by
the
county.
we
call
it
the
ban
to
(inaudible)
plan,
proposed
having
one
district
in
the
middle
of
the
county
that
would
be
black
and
the
other
four
commissioners
would
be
elected
at-large
from
the
rest
of
the
county.
that
plan
was
withdrawn
perhaps
after
we
named
it
the
(inaudible)
in
playing
up
to
the
south
african
homelands.
but
these
systems
can
all
be
manipulated.
it
is
as
much
a
political
decision
to
have
an
at-large
system
as
it
is,
to
have
district
system
and
as
much
a
political
decision
is
to
how
the
district
lines
should
be
drawn.
so
we
have
had
--
this
court
has
developed
a
long
line
of
cases
from
the
one
person,
one
vote
concept
and
has
had
a
rather
easily
manageable
--
rather
easily
manageable
standard
judicially
manageable
standard
of
numerical
equality.
but
black
citizens
have
a
strong
claim
to
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
what
this
case
shows
is
that
at-large
election
systems
can
have
and
has
had
in
this
case
for
many,
many,
many
years,
far
more
than
a
decennial
census,
the
opportunity
to
dilute
the
vote
of
the
minority
to
deny
the
equal
protection
under
the
law.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
