powell,
jr.
mr.
menefee,
it's
not
your
position
i
take
it
that
at-large
elections
are
per
se
invalid.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
tell
me
this.
i
have
never
been
to
your
county.
in
some
counties
in
florida,
you
have
very
substantial
spanish-american
citizens.
do
you
have
those
in
your
county?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
you
had
the
same
percentage
of
mexican
--
of
spanish-american
citizens,
would
they
be
entitled
to
a
separate
district?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
know
that
section
2
of
the
voting
rights
act
has
not
held,
but
as
i
understand
that
section,
we've
never
interpreted
it,
but
my
understanding
of
it
is
that
discriminatory
intent
is
irrelevant.
what
counts
is
the
effect,
so
that
the
effect
would
be
the
same
under
that
section.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
you
had
just
to
carry
it
a
little
farther,
what
puzzles
me
about
this
whole
area
of
the
law
is
how
far
it
may
be
carried
the
majority
voting
in
the
united
states
has
always
been
the
norm.
suppose
you
had
19%
of
orientals
and
so
on
down
--
down
the
road,
are
we
going
to
fractionate
indefinitely
the
population
to
that
extent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
don't
have
to
be
answered
today.
