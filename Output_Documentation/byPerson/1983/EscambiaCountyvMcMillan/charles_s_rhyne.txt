mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
santurri,
who
is
the
county
counsel
for
escambia
county,
is
here
and
i
suppose
if
he
wants
to
present
it
to
you,
he
will
be
here
to
present
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
thank
you.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
has
what?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes
they
have
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
have
changed
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
--
well,
i
think
the
merits
of
the
case
now
are
both
before
you.
but
the
court
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
went
right
ahead
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
since
we
didn't
have
a
stay.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
order
that
you
agreed
to
review
was
the
merits
of
that
at-large
elections
under
the
florida
constitution
and
that
is
what
i
intend
to
present
my
argument
and
address
to
now.
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
would
say
that
that
order
is
illegal,
null
and
void
because
the
court
that
issued
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
it.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
appellee's
claim
is
based
upon
a
complaint
that
they
have
been
denied
access
to
the
full
and
complete
access
to
the
at-large
election
system
provided
by
the
florida
constitution
and
to
the
political
process
leading
to
the
nominations
and
elections
in
the
county
commission
of
escambia
county.
i
should
have
said
that
escambia
county
is
adjacent
to
pensacola.
it
had
205,000
people
in
it
in
1970,
233,000
in
1980,
19.7
of
those
are
black,
in
1970,
16.20%
of
them
were
eligible
voters,
in
1980,
17.2
were
eligible
voters.
of
the
eligible
voters,
66.9
of
the
blacks
are
registered,
69.7
of
the
whites
are
registered.
so
there's
--
on
registration
and
on
really
participation
in
the
electoral
process
that
way,
they're
pretty
equal.
now,
first
of
all,
in
the
second
sentence
of
their
brief,
they
say
that
they
do
not
contend
in
this
case
that
any
statute
or
any
part
of
the
constitution
has
been
invalidated.
and
so
i
address
myself
to
jurisdiction.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
state
constitution
of
florida
over
which
escambia
has
no
control
whatever.
the
state
constitution
requires
at-large
elections
in
non-charter
counties
of
which
there
are
62
and
of
which
escambia
is
one.
in
connection
with
that
constitutional
provision,
they
have
also
adopted
an
election
system
which
is
(inaudible)
to
carry
out
these
elections.
and
so,
the
requirement
of
at-large
elections
and
the
requirements
for
carrying
it
out
are
entirely
state
action.
and
so
we
raise
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
requirements
of
article
iii
clause
2
or
section
2
clause
1
of
the
constitution
has
been
met
because
the
real
controversy
here
is
not
between
escambia
and
these
people
who
claim
they
have
been
harmed
by
the
at-large
elections
which
are
and
put
in,
maintained,
operated
entirely
by
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
they
once
did
have
such
a
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
kind
of
statute
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
must
sue
--
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
--
the
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
controlling
constitutional
provision
in
statutes.
are
all
those
of
the
state
of
florida?
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
you
have
got
to
prove
that
the
injury
that
you
claim
can
fairly
be
traced
to
the
challenged
action
of
the
defendant
and
not
traced
through
independent
action
by
some
other
party.
now,
you
have
independent
action
of
some
other
party,
the
state
of
florida
here,
that
controls
these
elections,
--
at-large
elections
internally.
the
county
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
them.
the
state
prescribes
them,
the
state
carries
them
out.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
you
would
have
to
join
the
state
of
florida,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
because
it
is
a
florida
statute
that
is
doing
them
the
harm.
escambia
is
not
doing
anything
to
him.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
it's
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
it's
involved
them
for
this
reason,
say,
like
in
rogers
versus
lodge.
you
had
special
state
statutes
applicable
only
to
burke
county.
but
this
is
a
statewide
constitutional
provision.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
justice
marshall,
they
didn't
administer
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
state
statute,
but
the
state
does.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
there
is
a
federal
statute,
justice
marshall,
that
requires
that
any
judge
before
whom
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
or
the
constitution
is
drawn
in
question
as
2403(b)
must
notify
the
state
attorney
general
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
that
this
is
true
so
that
he
can
be
called
to
come
and
defend
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
but
still
is
a
state
statute.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
at
state
causes
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
think
also,
your
honor,
this
statement
that
no
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision
has
been
invalidated
with
the
judgment
below
which
is
the
second
sentence
in
their
brief
is
a
statement
that's
very
hard
to
defend.
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
court
of
appeals
and
about
the
third
line
of
its
decision
says
that
the
lower
court
declared
this
constitution
and
statute
unconstitutional
and
then
they
affirmed
it.
so
that
statement
is
wrong.
now,
the
appellees
throughout
their
brief
have
constantly
claimed
that
it
is
florida's
constitution,
that's
at-large
constitution,
that
has
caused
some
damage
and
statement
after
statement
do
they
make
in
support
of
that
claim.
for
example,
two
years
after
this
case
was
filed
in
their
pretrial
statement,
they
say
that
they're
going
to
prove
their
case.
plaintiffs
contend
the
evidence
will
show
intentional,
invidious
racial
discrimination
by
the
state
of
florida,
not
by
escambia.
its
opposition
and
subdivision
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
that's
according
to
the
following
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
alternative
standards.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
all
right,
i
will
--
merely
in
my
statement
here
about
the
constitutionality
question
and
--
and
go
to
the
merits.
the
aforesaid
at-large
election
system
carry
forward
and
perpetuate
the
effects
of
past
intentual
devices
employed
by
the
state
to
discriminate
against
blacks.
and
so
we
say
under
those
circumstances,
under
those
conditions,
this
is
florida's
constitution,
this
is
florida's
statutes
and
not
escambia's
constitution,
not
escambia's
statutes.
and
then
under
article
iii,
section
2,
clause
1,
the
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction.
with
respect
to
the
merits,
i
would
first
of
all
address
myself
to
something
that
they
make
a
lot
of
in
connection
with
the
so-called
referendum.
i
assume
that
mr.
justice
brennan
because
that's
what
you
have
in
mind.
now,
the
referendums
were
not
suggested
by
the
blacks
or
because
it
was
in
discrimination
against
them.
they
had
had
a
referendum
on
whether
or
not
to
consolidate
pensacola
and
escambia.
that
had
been
voted
down.
and
so
the
commissioners
of
the
city
of
escambia
sought
ways
and
means
of
--
of
reforming
and
bringing
up
to
date
this
whole
area.
they're
simply
bursting
at
the
seams.
you
have
an
enormous
port
there,
the
largest
naval-air
station
in
the
world,
and
they
needed
to
reform
their
--
their
government.
so,
they
appointed
a
charter
study
committee
of
five,
one
of
whom
was
a
black
to
draw
up
a
new
charter
for
the
county
of
escambia
as
they
have
a
right
to
do.
and
this
charter
committee
worked
for
two
years.
and
on
the
20th
of
january
1977,
they
reported
that
they
were
divided
three
to
two.
they
reported
the
majority
a
plan
of
five
commissioners
being
elected
within
districts
into
at-large
and
particular
all
the
powers
that
all
of
these
various
local
officers
have
to
--
have
to
have.
i
have
written
a
lot
of
these
charters
myself,
you
have
seen
a
lot
of
them.
now,
this
charter
by
the
majority
was
rejected
by
the
minority
on
two
major
grounds.
number
one,
they
said
â€œwe
do
not
need
to
charter.
it's
too
costly
and
too
complex."
"we
don't
need
seven
commissioners.
five
is
enough.
they
ought
to
be
non-partners
and
elected
within
the
districts."
and
so
the
commissioners
then
appointed
another
study
committee
of
five.
and
that
committee
tried
to
put
together
the
ideas
of
the
two
--
of
the
two
defenders,
and
the
three
who
were
for
this
charter.
and
so
they
worked
for
three
or
four
months
and
came
up
with
a
new
charter.
and
they
recommended
five
elected
within
districts.
they
put
in
there
the
main
thing.
they
put
in
there
that
this
could
never
be
used
to
consolidate
pensacola
and
escambia.
that
seemed
to
be
the
major
thing
that
bothered
the
people
there
then.
and
they
also
revised
throughout
the
charter.
and
when
they
finished
that
revision,
they
called
in
their
staff
and
had
them
go
over
it
and
finally
by
august,
they
were
ready
to
go
public,
so
to
speak,
with
the
results
of
the
work
on
the
charter.
and
so,
they
announced
that
they
were
going
to
release
a
draft
of
this
charter
and
publish
it.
they
published
it
in
the
newspaper.
it
gave
out
15,000
copies
to
various
clubs,
study
clubs
and
things
like
that.
and
they
would
then
have
eight
public
hearings.
now,
let
me
stop
here
to
say
the
big
difference
between
this
charter
study
committee
and
a
chartered
commission
under
florida
law
is,
a
charter
commission,
you're
required
to
have
11
to
15
members.
they're
supposed
to
work
for
18
months
and
produce
a
charter
unless
the
time
is
extended.
and
then
when
--
they
hold
three
public
hearings
and
they
turn
the
charter
in,
the
commissioners
can't
do
anything
about
it.
they
can't
change
it
at
all.
the
commissioners
here
made
tremendous
changes
in
this
charter
and
one
of
them
was
to
keep
the
five
elected
at-large.
now,
the
other
side
pretends
this
was
the--
the
big
thing
that
was
before
the
people
in
connection
with
the
referendum
which
i
announced
would
take
place
on
november
8.
they
held
these
eight
hearings.
they
were
shocked
at
the
fact
that
only
15
or
20
people
came
out
to
the
various
hearings.
in
one
of
these
hearings,
three
blacks
did
appear
and
say
they
wanted
single-member
districts,
that
blacks
could
get
a
fair
deal
if
they
had
single-member
districts
than
if
they
had
elections
at-large.
and
so,
after
discussion
in
advertising
and
this
--
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
they
finally
adopted
on
the
14th
of
september,
a
final
draft
which
was
published
in
the
newspapers
and
was
given
to
anybody
who
wanted
to
study
it.
and
that
draft
was
voted
on,
then
in
november
and
defeated.
and
so
then,
we
were
into
1978
and
we
come
to
the
pretrial
statement
of
the
appellees
here.
and
again,
as
in
the
complaint,
a
referendum
wasn't
mentioned
in
--
in
the
complaint
or
the
possibility
of
having
itit
wasn't
mentioned
in
their
pretrial
statement.
the
pretrial
statement
was
just
the
one
that
i
just
read
you.
it
was
all
aimed
at
the
state
of
florida.
and
so
at
the
hearing
before
judge
arnow,
they
asked
each
one
of
the
commissioners
that
each
testified
as
to
why
they
favored
at-large
rather
than
single-member
districts.
and
the
general
purport
of
it
was
the
problems
are
at-large
and
so
therefore,
the
cure
must
be
at-large.
and
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
what
--
what
he
--
that
one
commissioner
--
commissioner
beck
testified
that
he
went
out
in
selected
roads
to
be
fixed
and
all
that
kind
of
thing.
chairman
kelson
and
this
and
the
other
said,
they
operated
countywide
and
--
and
even
beck
said
he
operated
countywide.
so
that
is
picking
out
one
statement
that
the
--
one
of
the
commissioners
made.
and
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
didn't
--
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
is
an
enormous
statement.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
an
erroneous
statement
by
the
district
court.
so,
then
we
go
to
the
thing
--
he
held
that
on
the
consideration
of
the
charter
that
the
commissioners
had
all
testified
that
they
kept
five
for
good
government
reasons
and
he
also
pointed
out
that
they
filed
a
post-trial
memorandum.
and
once
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
keep
the
five
to
protect
incumbency.
the
court
of
appeals,
when
they
got
that,
they
said
they
had
read
the
entire
testimony.
they
found
no
evidence
whatever
of
racial
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
and
that
protecting
one's
incumbency
didn't
mean
blacks
require
blacks,
and
so
therefore,
reversed.
they
did
grant
a
rehearing.
they
did
grant
comments
only
on
the
rogers
versus
lodge
and
not
a
--
not
a
rehearing
at
all.
and
in
--
in
doing
so,
they
decided
that
the
rogers
versus
lodge
was
different
from
white
verus
regester
and
whitcomb
versus
chavis
and
the
other
cases
like
mobile
versus
bolden
and
therefore,
had
given
them
a
--
a
broader
way
to
uphold,
give
greater
deference
to
the
finding
of
district
courts.
and
they
said,
we're
not
taking
back
our
statement
about
the
incumbency
and
they
didn't
take
back
their
statement
about
having
read
all
the
evidence
and
found
no
racial
motivation.
they
said
they
consider
the
broader
range
evidence.
the
broader
range
of
evidence
was
all
of
this
discriminatory
action
by
the
state
over
the
past
100
years.
their
brief,
over
and
over
again,
talks
about
the
discrimination,
the
black
crow
laws,
the
poll
tax
laws,
the
white
supremacy,
primaries
and
all
those
things,
justice
marshall.
for
the
past
100
years,
the
discrimination
against
blacks
throughout
florida
and
they
didn't
tie
that
in
to
escambia
at
all.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
constitutional
issue
to
be
is
equality
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
are
the
voters
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
treated
equally
in
their
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that
we
had
to
prove
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
they
had
to
prove
that
they
were
discriminated
against,
that
they
did
get
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
at
the
polls.
now,
there
were
--
as
i
say,
it's
--
it
was
66%
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
what?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles

rhyne
more
were

charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
there
was
no
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
had
to
prove
that
there
were
some
racial
reasons
to
keep
them
from
the
polls
and
from
them
having
equality.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
they
had
to
prove
they
were
held
by
the
people
in
escambia.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
five
commissioners
and
the
state
itself,
since
everything
was
run
by
the
state.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
there
were
only
four
of
them
at
the
time
this
came
along,
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
they
had
to
prove
some
racial
discrimination
against
them
that
prevented
them
from
having
an
equal
vote.
they
--
they
didn't
have
equal
access
to
the
nominating
and
election
procedures.
and
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
projected
state
of
mind
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
did.
i
think
the
--
the
--
to
show
the
one
difference
at
least,
the
legislative
committee
came
along
and
proposed
a
new
referendum
which
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
had
to
prove
that
the
state
itself
which
--
what
this
system
maintain
it
and
operate.
it
did
so
for
racial
discrimination
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
purposes
in
escambia.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
a
part
of
it.
but
you
don't
have
any
--
any
racial
discrimination
in
--
in
escambia
at
all.
and
so
i
think
that
--
that
they
had
to
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
(voice

mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
yes,
they
do.
yes.
they
have
to
prove
that
their
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
would
say
they
had
to
prove
a
majority
of
them
and
i
think
that
this
case,
and
i
hope
when
the
court
thinks
about
it
really
turns
on
the
jurisdictional
point
that
the
state
controlled
everything
and
that
the
escambians
had
nothing
to
say
about
it.
there
was
no
complaint
from
anybody
about
the
polls
and
about
voting,
no
impediments,
whatever,
no
complaints
about
the
--
the
services
rendered,
no
complaints
about
access.
all
the
complaints
were
related
to
the
state.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
that
one
minute,
i
want
to
say
that
all
of
the
matters
that
you
have
been
referring
to
of
discrimination
were
state
action
and
not
action
by
escambia
county.
