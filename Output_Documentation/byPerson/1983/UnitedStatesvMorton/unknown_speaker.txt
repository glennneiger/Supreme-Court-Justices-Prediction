unknown
speaker
you
left
out
that
he
was
served
on
the
case
itself
from
alabama
by
mail.
unknown
speaker
have
you
seen
many
judgments
on
more
than
one
piece
of
paper?
unknown
speaker
on
more
than
one
piece
of
paper.
aren't
they
usually
one
piece
of
paper?
unknown
speaker
the
way
to
try
that
out
would
be
in
the
alabama
courts,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
else
can
you
try
out
jurisdiction
of
the
alabama
court
other
than
in
the
alabama
court.
you
say
they
didn't
have
in
personum
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
all
he
had
to
do
was
appear
specially
and
try
that
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--mrs.
carroll,
you
say
regular,
when
it
refers
to
a
writ
regular
on
its
face
that,
you
say
then
you
are
talking
about
the
face
of
a
"record"
rather
than
the
writ?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
do
you
think
regular
on
its
face
modifies
legal
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
interpretation
would
offer...
would
leave
the
disbursing
officers
at
sea,
i
would
think,
if
they
can't
simply
look
at
what
they
are
served
with
and
make
a
judgment.
well,
sir,
if
you
will
look
at
this
case
and
read
this
entire
brief,
i
think
you
will
see
it
is
not
the
disbursing
officer
that
receives
them.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
there
from
the
man
and
men
of
the
finance
center
who
reviewed
these
legally,
and
they
are
lawyers,
and
it
says
that
it
is
their
sole
duty
to
review
this
legally
to
see
if
it
meets
the
legal
qualifications
set
forth.
is
there
a
provision
in
either
the
statute
or
the
regulations
as
to
what
personnel
in
the
service
the
writ
of
garnishment
will
be
served
upon?
unknown
speaker
did
he
at
any
time
ask
for
appointment
of
a
guardian?
unknown
speaker
my
question...
he
did
not--
unknown
speaker
--he
did
not
ask.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
he
be
heard
to
complain
about
something
he
didn't
ask
for?
unknown
speaker
do
you
realize
that
the
alabama
court's
decision
is
not
before
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
been
arguing
about
it...
you
have
been
arguing
about
it
for
the
last
15
minutes.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
