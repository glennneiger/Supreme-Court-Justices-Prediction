mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court,
this
is
a
military
pay
case.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
i
am
sorry.
does
this
need
to
be
up?
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
all
right,
sir.
thank
you.
this
is
a
military
pay
case.
it
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
and
how
it
is
supposed
to
be
administered
by
the
military
services.
this
case
does
not
in
any
way
affect
the
alabama
court
order.
it
does
not
modify.
it
does
not
hold
it
void.
it
does
not
say
anything
to
alabama
and
to
the
order.
all
it
says
to
it
is,
you
may
not
enforce
it
in
this
manner
simply
because
it
does
not
qualify
under
the
definitions
set
forth
in
the
federal
statute,
which
is
42
usc
659
and
662,
because
that
was
amended
in
1977
for
the
sole
reason
of
clarifying
this
statute,
as
senator
nunn
made
it
clear
when
he
argued
for
this
amendment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
since
that
is
true,
we
have
to
look...
this
is
not
a
man
that
is
trying
to
escape
liability
as
you
have
heard
about
so
many
times,
and
you
have
heard
them
talk
about
the
reason
for
this
statute.
not
so.
he
kept
right
on
paying.
this
man
kept
on
voluntarily
paying.
after
he
had
paid
once
in
leudon
county,
and
after
he
had...
after
mrs.
morton
had
gone
to
alabama,
and
after
he
had
one
of
the
children
with
him,
the
other
one
was
married
and
over
the
age
of
18,
he
still
kept
on
paying
something
to
her
pursuant
to
their
initial
agreement
between
the
parties.
let's
look
at
this
a
little
bit
more.
not
all
military
people
involved
in
these
things
are
colonels.
they
are
not
all
in
the
situation
that
colonel
morton
is
in.
some
of
them,
and
very
recently,
have
been
in
combat.
these
people
in
grenada,
these
people
in
beirut.
and
there
is
going
to
be
more.
we
cannot
say
that
we
are
always
going
to
have
peace
in
this
country.
but
what
they
are
really
saying
to
him
is,
and
to
every
soldier
and
military
man
is,
you
have
got
to
tell
your
commanding
officer,
time,
sir,
stop
the
war,
i
have
got
to
go
home
and
fight
a
divorce
case,
because
the
ex-wife
remarries,
commingles
her
property
with
the
husband,
his
tenants
buy
the
entirety,
and
where
is
it?
now,
they
have
admitted
at
page
6
of
the
reply
brief
that
colonel
morton's
pay
was
indeed
taken
without
due
process
of
law.
the
only
basis
of
this,
of
course,
would
be
the
lack
of
in
personum
jurisdiction,
and
we
are
talking
about
what
are
legal
obligations.
now,
he
is
arguing
on
this
statute
before
it
came
into...
before
the
amendments
came
into
effect.
when
the
amendments
came
into
effect,
it
put
certain
definitions
in
this
statute,
and
this
definition
makes
all
the
difference.
he
says
it
is
only
the
writ
that
we
may
look
at.
then
why
in
the
world
would
congress
have
said,
payments
to
provide
for
health
care,
education,
recreation,
clothing,
and
to
meet
other
specific
needs
of
such
child
or
children,
such
term
also
includes
attorney
fees,
interest,
and
court
costs
when
and
to
the
extent
that
the
same
are
expressly
recoverable
as
such,
pursuant
to
a
decree,
order,
or
judgment
issued
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
state
law
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
does
that
mean
the
garnishment
writ?
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
it
means
that
they
have
to
look.
when
they
say
on
the
face
of,
the
face
of
a
judgment
is
the
face
of
the
record,
and
not
one
sheet
of
paper.
they
saw
one
sheet
of
paper.
it
said
"court"
and
they
stamped
it
approved.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
many
judgments,
sir?
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
yes,
sir,
but,
sir,
when
it
says
regular
on
its
face--
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
--no,
sir.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
that's
right.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
your
honor,
they
did
not
at
any
time
even
acknowledge
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act,
and
they
entered
a
void
judgment
without
it.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
he
relied
on
the
advice
of
the
air
force
jab
at
elmundorf
who
told
him
that
he
did
not
have
to
bother
with
this,
that
they
could
not
take
his
pay.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
the
face
of
the
record,
sir.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
the
statute
says
legal
process
regular
on
its
face
from
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
i
don't
think
so,
because
legal
process
has
indeed
been
pulled
out
of
the
statute
and
defined
specifically
in
the
definitions
at
662(c).
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
yes,
sir,
there
is,
and
it
is
served
upon
the
finance
officer
in
denver
in
this
case.
elmundorf
is
a
mistake.
the
finance
officer
in
elmundorf
is
the
local
finance
officer.
the
place
where
it
was
served
was
in
denver.
mr.
james
russell's
affidavit
before
the
court
and
which
is
cited
here
in
both
the
petitioner's
brief,
petition,
and
in
the
court
below
in
the
dissent
sets
it
out
quite
clearly,
that
they
are
legally
reviewed.
of
course,
if
they
find
this
too
difficult
to
do,
then
there
are
such
things
as
administrative
judges,
but
there
is
some
reason
for
congress
amending
this
statute.
they
just
didn't
do
it
out
of
the
sheer
love
of
going
in
there
and
amending
for
nothing
whatsoever.
if
their
position
is
true,
why
in
the
world
would
they
have
bothered
to
amend
this
statute
and
put
this
in
saying
you
will
have
no
liability
if
and
only
if?
they
would
not.
congress
is
never
presumed
to
do
a
useless
act,
and
that
is
what
they
are
saying.
the
thing
here
is
that
it
does
say
in
the
major
portion
of
this
659
section
of
that
statute
that
they
must
be
treated
like
any
other
private
person.
well,
in
alabama,
there
is
a
case
that
was
cited
by
the
dissent
which
is
the
case
of
harris
versus
national
bank,
a
1981
case
long
after
these
alabama
statutes
came
into
being
which
said
once
the
amount
is
paid
it
discharges
the
garnishee,
and
in
that
case
they
cited
the
old
1876
case
of
pounds
versus
hammer,
which
says
that
any
garnishee
paying
on
a
void
judgment
is
liable.
now,
in
the
case
that...
this
harris
versus
national
bank
case,
the
court
there
said,
i
am
going
to
send
this
back,
because
this
garnishee
has
to
be
repaid.
who
it's
to
be
repaid
from
cannot
be
decided
on
the
set
of
facts
before
this
court.
but
apparently
they
are
both
liable
if
you
read
that
case.
and
that
falls
into
place
with
the
case
cite
of
betts
versus
cole,
the
1979
hawaii
case
cited
by
the
majority.
but
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
air
force
advocates
that
this
is...
you
may
just
unilaterally
take
somebody's
pay,
that
you
don't
have
to
look,
and
that
you
don't
have
to
be
careful.
they
are
impatient
with
the
law.
they
are
impatient
with
process.
if
indeed
they
were
a
stakeholder,
they
would
have
no
problem
with
putting
the
case
over
into
the
federal
court
and
let
them
decide
whether
the
alabama
court
itself
had
been
totally
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
unfair.
that
court,
i
might
say,
would
not
really,
in
my
opinion,
be
a
fair
court
to
go
back
to
under
the
circumstances.
it
would
appear
to
me
also
that
if
they
had
just
once
done
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
as
far
as
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act
is
concerned
and
appointed
a
guardian
to
represent
this
man,
all
of
this
would
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
the
law
does
not
require
him
to
ask,
sir.
he
did
not.
that
would
have
been
an
appearance
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
no,
sir.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
no,
sir.
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
yes,
sir,
because
the
burden
is
not
on
him.
that
particular
law
places
the
burden
upon
the
court
to
do
that,
and
says
it
shall
not
enter
a
default
judgment
unless
this
is
done.
this
case
is
such
a
unique
case.
it
is
a
murphy's
law
case
below.
everything
that
could
possibly
happen
wrong
in
a
case
happened
in
that
case.
if
this
case
is
upheld,
then
women
can
judge
shop
and
forum
shop
all
over
the
united
states.
they
can
go
anywhere.
they
can
then
garnish
on
the
strength
of
a
void
judgment,
and
they
can
say
to
the
husbands,
you
know,
well,
when
you
are
gone,
i
will
take
the
money.
when
i
am
remarried,
there
is
no
way
you
are
going
to
get
it
back.
and
this
is
not
a
fair
procedure.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
is
the
very
reason
that
congress
enacted
this
amendment
to
this
act.
there
are,
according
to
the
air
force
brief,
there
are
13,000
military
garnishments
to
be
had
as
a
result
of
this
new
act,
and
yet
you
will
see
only
four
or
five
cases,
and
though
this
was
the
most
dire
diversion
of
what
the
law
had
been,
there
have
been...
there
has
been
amazingly
little
litigation
on
it.
mostly
it
is
not
difficult
to
look
at
an
order
and
see
that
there
are
two
attorneys
signed
on
the
bottom
of
it.
second,
it
is
not
too
hard
to
ask
to
send
me
a
copy
of
the
return
and
a
copy
of
the
state
law,
which
is
done
in
the
erisa
act
all
the
time.
that
is
not
a
difficult
thing
for
any
person
to
do
that
is
trained
in
the
law.
and
it
would
appear
to
me
that
somebody
has
got
to
look
out
for
soldiers
who
are
gone
and
not
let
this
kind
of
thing
happen.
yes,
it
is
unique.
it
is
very
rare.
ex
parte
judgments
are
very
rare
to
begin
with,
and
then
for
this
kind
of
thing
to
happen
is
extremely
unique.
the
bad
part
about
this
is
there
is
no
preexisting
debt
unless
that
lower
court
did
in
fact
have
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant.
there
is
no
debt
for
alimony
and
child
support.
it
is
not
like
a
business
case
where
you
have
a
preexisting
debt
and
you
may
go
in
and
enforce
a
preexisting
debt.
the
air
force
has
not
paid
off
a
legal
obligation
of
his,
so
they
are
not
paying
him
twice.
they
haven't
paid
him
in
the
first
instance.
all
of
this
is
very
different
from
your
business
case.
when
they
adopted
the
law
of
garnishment,
congress
took
with
it
a
whole
body
of
law,
and
these
are
distinguishable
in
that
you
have
to
remember
that
none
of
these
cases
that
are
domestic
cases
have
a
debt
existing.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
in
looking
at
the
whole
decision
would
say
that
there
has
been
a
fair
decision
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
alabama
court
is
concerned.
however--
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
--absolutely,
sir,
except
there
has
been
a
finding
by
the
court
of
claims--
mr.
kaletah
n.
carroll
--yes,
sir,
and
that
is
because
our
statute
requires
that
alimony
and
child
support
be
in
accordance
with
the
alabama
law.
they
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
alabama
law.
otherwise,
there
is
liability.
thank
you,
sir.
