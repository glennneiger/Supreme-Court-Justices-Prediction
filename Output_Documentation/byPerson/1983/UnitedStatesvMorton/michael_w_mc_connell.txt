mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
united
states
in
its
capacity
as
employer
and
garnishee
is
required
to
reimburse
an
employee
for
sums
deducted
from
his
paycheck
in
compliance
with
the
facially
valid
state
court
writ
of
garnishment
enforcing
a
judgment
for
alimony
and
child
support.
the
state
court
subsequently
was
found
not
to
have
had
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
employee
respondent
here
in
the
underlying
divorce
proceeding.
the
legal
framework
under
which
this
case
arises
is
a
federal
garnishment
statute,
42
usc
659,
which
waives
federal
sovereign
immunity
and
subjects
federal
agencies
to
suit
in
the
capacity
as
garnishee
to
enforce
alimony
and
child
support
in
like
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
any
private
garnishee
and
which
expressly
immunizes
the
united
states
from
liability
for
honoring
any
legal
process
regular
on
its
face.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
quite
simple
when
viewed
from
the
perspective
of
a
federal
disbursing
officer
whose
only
responsibility
is
to
ensure
that
the
garnishment
writ
is
regular
on
its
face.
in
august,
1975,
respondent's
wife
obtained
a
divorce,
including
alimony
and
child
support,
pursuant
to
a
default
judgment
in
alabama
state
court.
over
a
year
later,
in
december,
1975,
the
air
force
finance
office
at
elmundorf
air
base
in
alaska
was
served
a
writ
of
garnishment
to
collect
arrearages
in
colonel
morton's
obligations
under
the
divorce
decree.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
air
force
finance
office
received
two
documents.
it
received
a
writ
of
garnishment
and
it
received
a
copy
of
the
underlying
judgment
of
divorce
issued
by
the
alabama
state
court.
the
disbursing
officer
attached...
assigned
to
the
case
applied
the
usual
procedures
in
processing
it,
examining
the
document
to
make
sure
that
it
was
one
that
qualified
under
the
statute.
he
looked
first
to
see
if
it
was
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
the
writ
was
issued
by
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
court
of
the
state
of
alabama,
which
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
unquestionably
is
a
court
competent
to
issue
a
writ
of
garnishment.
he
checked
second
to
see
if
the
writ
was
to
enforce
an
order
for
child
support
or
alimony.
since
the
federal
garnishment
statute
does
not
permit
garnishment
for
other
purposes,
such
as
rent
or
commercial
loans
or
the
like,
it
is
necessary
to
make
sure
that
it
is
for
child
support
or
alimony.
in
this
case,
the
face
of
the
writ
revealed
that
the
sums
were
being
sought
for
that
purpose.
third,
he
checked
to
see
if
the
writ
was
in
the
proper
form,
and
as
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact,
the
writ
of
garnishment
was
in
the
proper
form,
the
usual
form
used
by
the
state
of
alabama
for
writs
of
garnishment.
and
finally,
the
officer
examined
the
writ
to
see
if
there
were
any
irregularities
on
the
face
of
the
writ
which
would
suggest
invalidity
under
state
or
federal
law.
now,
i
mentioned
that
there
were
two
documents
served
on
the
air
force.
the
other
document
was
a
copy
of
the
judgment
of
divorce.
now,
in
this
instance
that
document
was
not
necessary
for
the
processing
of
the
writ.
under
the
regulations
of
the
office
of
personnel
management
which
implement
this
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
file
a
copy
of
the
underlying
decree
only
when
the
writ
itself
does
not
make
plain
whether
it
was
for
child
support
and
alimony
alone,
which
is
not
uncommon,
since
some
writs
of
garnishment
do
not
specify
the
nature
of
the
underlying
obligation.
in
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
the
writ
itself
indicated
that
it
was
for
child
support
or
alimony.
thus
the
second
document
was
not
necessary.
nonetheless,
it
is
worth
noting
that
a
copy
of
the
judgment
of
divorce
was
also
regular
on
its
face.
there
are
no
irregularities
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
document
that
would
suggest
invalidity,
and
in
the
first
line
of
the
judgment
of
divorce,
it
states
that
respondent
was
duly
served
and
failed
to
appear
in
the
divorce
proceeding.
upon
receiving
the
writ,
the
finance
office
promptly
notified
colonel
morton,
who
then
sought
legal
advice.
upon
the
advice
of
counsel,
colonel
morton
protested
the
garnishment
to
the
finance
office
on
several
grounds.
first,
he
claimed
that
he
had
in
fact
been
satisfying
on
a
regular
monthly
basis
his
obligations
for
divorce
and
alimony.
second,
he
claimed
that
he
was
neither
domiciled
in
nor
a
resident
of
alabama.
and
third,
he
claimed
that
he
had
not
been
properly
served
in
the
divorce
proceeding.
since
none
of
these
matters
went
to
the
question
of
the
regularity
of
the
writ
on
its
face,
the
disbursing
officer
answered
the
writ
and
subsequently
deducted
the
sums
owing
to
mrs.
morton
and
paid
them
over
to
the
registry
of
the
alabama
court.
colonel
morton
did
not
then
nor
has
he
at
any
time
since
challenged
the
state
court
judgment
in
the
alabama
courts.
this
is
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
notice
which
was
provided
him
by
the
air
force
expressly
informed
him
that
he
might
have
defenses
to
the
underlying
action,
advised
him
to
seek
legal
counsel,
and
informed
him
that
the
united
states
would
not
be
asserting
his
defenses
for
him
in
the
garnishment
action.
in
fact,
colonel
morton
did
seek
advice
of
counsel
from
not
one
but
two
attorneys,
and
on
their
advice
he
chose
not
to
challenge
the
underlying
action.
the
position
of
the
government
on
these
facts
is
straightforward.
the
garnishment
writ
was
regular
on
its
face.
colonel
morton's
arguments,
whether
he
had
paid
his
obligations,
whether
the
court's
recital
that
he
had
been
duly
served
was
accurate,
and
whether
he
had
had
sufficient
contacts
with
alabama
to
justify
jurisdiction
were
beyond
the
ken
of
disbursing
officers
and
beyond
their
powers
and
responsibilities
under
the
statute
and
implementing
regulations.
the
air
force
was
required
in
like
manner
and
to
the
same
extent,
no
more,
no
less
than
any
private
garnishee
to
comply
with
the
state
court
legal
process.
now,
the
facts
and
legal
principles
applicable
to
this
case
when
viewed
from
respondent's
position,
that
is,
looking
to
see
whether
there
was
in
fact
personal
jurisdiction
over
colonel
morton
in
that
underlying
divorce
proceeding,
are
considerably
more
complicated,
and
i
will
leave
those
facts
for
opposing
counsel
to
develop.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
courts
below
found
it
necessary
to
determine
and
to
rely
upon
the
following
facts
among
others.
they
looked
at
where
colonel
morton
voted.
they
looked
at
where
he
paid
taxes
and
why.
they
looked
at
where
he
registered
his
automobile,
why
he
used
his
moving
allowance
to
send
his
family
to
alabama,
what
his
subjective
intentions
were
when
he
moved
to
alaska,
and
the
like.
just
a
recital
of
some
of
these
facts
should
indicate
that
these
are
not
the
facts
which
are
within
the
ordinary
purview
of
the
disbursing
officer
paying
out
federal
salaries,
but
even
after
the
facts
had
been
established
by
the
trial
court
below,
the
able
judges
of
the
federal
circuit
were
not
able
to
agree
on
the
legal
conclusions
to
be
given
those
facts.
they
in
fact
split
on
a
two
to
one
vote
on
the
question
of
whether
the
alabama
divorce
court
did
have
jurisdiction
over
colonel
morton,
but
of
course
the
majority
on
the
panel
did
conclude
that
the
alabama
court
had
erred
on
the
question
of
its
own
jurisdiction,
and
that
the
air
force
should
have
refused
to
honor
the
alabama
writ.
this
case
is
thus
a
perfect
illustration
of
why
congress
limited
the
responsibility
of
the
federal
disbursing
agents
to
determining
whether
the
writ
is
regular
on
its
face,
and
why
it
makes
neither
practical
nor
legal
sense
to
put
the
federal
government
at
the
risk
of
double
payment
when
the
disbursing
officer
honors
a
state
court
order
at
risk
on
facts
that
the
officer
has
no
means
of
knowing,
and
on
legal
determinations
that
the
officer
has
no
authority
or
capacity
to
make.
it
puts
the
federal
government
at
risk
that
a
federal
court
may
subsequently
decide
that
a
facially
valid
state
court
order
which
the
employee
himself
had
chosen
not
to
challenge
at
the
time
had
been
erroneously
entered.
the
practical
effect
on
the
federal
government
is
plain.
respondent's
theory
subjects
the
government
unfairly
to
double
liability
even
where
it
has
performed
all
of
the
actions
that
the
law
requires,
but
the
practical
effect
on
the
congressional
scheme
in
the
garnishment
statute
is
equally
important.
congress
passed
the
garnishment
statute
in
1974
for
the
express
purpose
of
providing
a
rapid
and
convenient
means
whereby
former
spouses
and
children
could
obtain
enforcement
of
child
support
and
alimony
judgments.
it
was
based
expressly
on
the
findings
by
congress
that
then
existing
remedies
were
inadequate.
in
fact,
after
hearings
and
considerable
investigation,
congress
concluded
that
the
failure
of
the
system
to
provide
adequate
enforcement
of
child
support
and
alimony
orders
were
a
major
contributing
cause
to
poverty
and
to
the
welfare
problem,
finding
that
there
were
large
numbers
of
affluent
and
middle
class
fathers
who
simply
abandoned
their
families
and
did
not
comply
with
the
orders,
leaving
their
families
dependent
upon
public
assistance.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
intended
for
garnishment
writs
to
be
honored
on
the
basis
of
the
state
court
order
or
decision
alone.
it
did
not
impose
any
other
conditions
precedent
to
the
payment.
but
under
the
holding
of
the
court
below,
the
government
will
be
forced
to
take
steps
to
protect
itself
from
double
liability.
each
of
these
possible
alternative
steps
would
erect
an
additional
and
unintended
obstacle
to
the
congressional
purposes.
there
are
three
basic
alternatives
that
the
government
faces
in
an
instance
where
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
underlying
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
entered
the
original
judgment.
now,
respondent
suggests,
and
this
was
also
the
alternative
mentioned
by
the
court
below,
that
the
government
simply
refused
to
comply
with
any
garnishment
writ
where
the
employee
has
claimed
that
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
the
underlying
decree
is
defective.
but
the
effect
of
this
would
be
to
unilaterally
deny
the
benefits
of
this
statute
to
the
spouses
and
children
to
whom
congress
intended
that
they
be
present,
and
it
would
relegate
them
to
the
very
remedies
that
congress
had
found
inadequate.
now,
i
realize
that
the
court
below,
echoed
by
respondent
in
his
brief
in
this
court,
are
considerably
more
upbeat
about
those
remedies
that
congress
had
considered
and
found
inadequate.
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
that
particular
debate,
because
for
purposes
of
interpreting
what
congress
intended
for
this
statute,
it
matters
only
that
congress
drew
the
conclusion
that
those
remedies
were
inadequate,
and
it
is
manifestly
contrary
to
the
congressional
purposes
to
enable
a
federal
disbursing
officer
because
of
his
unilateral
doubts
about
a
state
court
process
to
deny
those
benefits
to
the
spouses
and
children
congress
intended
to
assist.
but
all
of
this
is
even
assuming
that
the
united
states,
having
agreed
to
be
subject
in
like
manner
and
to
the
same
extent
as
any
private
garnishee
to
garnishment
writs
would
be
free
to
disregard
a
facially
valid
and
binding
state
court
order,
a
matter
which
we
consider
highly
dubious
on
its
face.
the
more
likely
alternative
here
is
that
the
government's
explanation
for
refusing
to
honor
a
writ
would
be
treated
as
an
answer
or
return
under
state
law,
but
this
would
then
put
the
government
in
the
position
of
litigating
against
the
spouse
and
children
who
were
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
statute.
they
would
be
litigating
against
the
spouse
and
children
in
state
court
on
behalf
of
the
employee
concerning
the
validity
of
the
underlying
divorce.
i
can
imagine
few
roles
which
are
less
appropriate
for
the
united
states
government
than
for
it
to
be
litigating
on
one
side
in
state
court
of
a
marital
dispute,
and
it
would
turn
the
purpose
of
the
garnishment
statute
on
its
head.
congress
intended
to
make
it
easier
for
spouses
and
children
to
collect
their
alimony
and
child
support
rights,
and
instead,
under
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
the
government
would
be
enlisted
as
their
opponent
in
collecting
those
benefits.
the
final
alternative
which
in
my
view
is
the
most
likely
in
the
long
run
if
the
judgment
below
were
affirmed
is
that
the
united
states
would
be
forced
to
file
interpleader
actions
in
federal
court
to
resolve
who
would
be
entitled
to
receive
the
employee's
salary.
this
would
indeed
get
the
united
states
off
the
hook
for
double
liability,
but
there
is
very
little
else
in
the
procedure
that
commends
it.
first
of
all,
the
spouse
and
children
would
be
forced
to
litigate
their
rights
a
second
time
in
a
more
expensive
forum.
secondly,
it
would
not
even
benefit
the
employee,
the
working
spouse,
since
he
would
be
required
to
litigate
as
well,
most
likely
in
the
very
state
where
the
spouse
and
children
are
living,
which
was
the
very
thing
which
he
is
trying
to
avoid
through
all
of
this,
and
the
federal
courts
would
be
inundated
with
numerous
new
interpleader
actions,
in
each
one
of
which
the
question
would
be
whether
a
state
court
divorce
decree
had
been
properly
entered.
neither
the
purpose
of
the
statute
nor
any
other
sensible
public
policy
would
be
promoted
by
this
course
of
events.
but
the
results
are
not
required,
we
submit,
by
the
statute
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
section
659(a)
subjects
the
united
states
to
exactly
the
same
obligations
as
are
imposed
on
private
garnishees,
yet
private
garnishees
are
not
required
to
second
guess
state
court
judgments
or
to
litigate
on
behalf
of
the
principal
debtors.
it
is
well
established
under
the
law
of
virtually
every
jurisdiction
that
the
duty
of
a
garnishee
to
his
creditor
is
simply
to
give
notice
of
the
action,
no
more.
even
more
clearly,
section
659(f)
immunizes
the
government
from
liability
for
honoring
a
legal
process
that
is
regular
on
its
face.
that
seems
plain
enough.
the
writ
here,
the
garnishment
writ
was
regular
on
its
face.
the
government
should
not
be
held
liable
for
having
honored
it.
to
reach
its
contrary
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
rather
roundabout
route
of
interpretation,
holding
that
because
the
term
"legal
process"
is
defined
in
the
statute
to
be,
among
other
things,
process
which
is
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
then
holding
that
the
term
"competent
jurisdiction"
necessarily
means
both
personal
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
garnishment
writ
is
not
legal
process
regular
on
its
face
if
the
underlying
judgment
had
been
entered
without
personal
jurisdiction
over
the
employee.
well,
there
are
at
least
three
flaws
in
this
analysis.
first,
it
fails
to
read
the
phrase
"legal
process
regular
on
its
face.
"
as
a
whole.
it
yanks
the
term
"legal
process"
away
from
its
context.
in
context,
it
seems
apparent
that
those
attributes
of
being
legal
process
should
be
matters
that
are
discernible
from
the
face
of
the
writ.
otherwise,
the
words
"on
its
face"
would
effectively
have
no
meaning
in
the
context
of
the
statute.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
the
wrong
court.
the
statute
provides
immunity
for
the
united
states
for
complying
with
legal
process
that
was
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
under
the
definitions.
the
legal
process
that
the
united
states
complied
with
was
the
garnishment
writ.
the
question
should
be
whether
the
court
that
issued
that
writ
was
competent
to
do
so,
not
whether
a
divorce
judgment
which
was
underlying
that
degree
was
issued
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
now,
the
garnishment
court
is
in
some
senses
an
ancillary
proceeding
to
the
underlying
judgment,
but
for
jurisdictional
purposes
it
is
a
new
action
which
is
brought
by
the
plaintiff,
mrs.
morton,
against
the
garnishee,
the
united
states,
as
the
defendant,
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
tenth
judicial
circuit
court
of
alabama
was
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
issue
this
garnishment
writ.
whether
or
not
the
alabama
court
properly
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
divorce
is
simply
beside
the
point.
the
third
flaw
in
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
is
that
it
assumes
a
definition
of
competent
jurisdiction
that
is
quite
unnecessary
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
context
in
which
it
is
used.
competent
jurisdiction
is
a
term
which
frequently
is
used
to
mean
subject
matter
jurisdiction
alone.
it
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
a
court
is
competent
to
issue
a
particular
type
of
order
in
a
particular
class
of
cases.
now,
in
order
to
tell
whether
it
has
that
definition
or
the
more
expansive
definition,
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
term
in
context,
and
since
in
context
it
is
apparent
that
it
should
be
a
matter
which
is
discernible
on
the
face
of
the
writ,
it
is
plain
that
the
court
of
appeals
drew
a
conclusion
which
was
unnecessary
and
in
fact
inconsistent
with
some
of
the
other
terms
in
the
statute.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
reached
the
tortured
conclusion
out
of
a
fear
that
a
contrary
construction
of
the
garnishment
statute
would
violate
colonel
morton's
due
process
rights.
we
submit
that
there
are
no
due
process
problems
that
would
demand
a
non-literal
interpretation
of
this
statute.
colonel
morton's
due
process
rights
may
well
have
been
violated
by
the
alabama
divorce
judgment,
assuming
that
the
alabama
courts
in
fact
lacked
personal
jurisdiction
over
him,
but
that,
of
course,
is
true
whenever
a
court
erroneously
exercises
jurisdiction
over
a
person.
colonel
morton
received
notice
of
the
divorce
proceeding
and
made
a
deliberate
tactical
judgment
not
to
defend
his
rights
in
that
forum.
he
could
have
made
a
special
appearance
to
contest
jurisdiction
in
the
alabama
court.
he
could
have
done
so
even
after
the
initial
entering
of
the
final
judgment,
since
he
could
do
so
in
the
course
of
defending
the
garnishment
order.
and
indeed
because
he
is
a
serviceman,
colonel
morton
has
remedies
that
are
available
far
in
excess
of
those
available
to
other
citizens.
under
the
soldiers
and
sailors
civil
relief
act,
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
send
a
letter
to
the
alabama
state
court,
and
he
could
have
procured
a
stay
of
the
action.
he
could
have
obtained
another
look
at
the
judgment
even
after
it
had
been
entered,
or
he
could
have
obtained
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
at
litum
for
him
in
the
action.
but
instead,
on
advice
of
counsel,
colonel
morton
did
nothing
to
protect
his
rights,
and
even
today
colonel
morton
has
remedies
that
are
available
to
him
if
his
due
process
rights
have
been
violated.
he
would
be
able
to
cut
off
any
future
garnishments
by
simply
defending
against
one
of
the
garnishments
on
the
basis
of
this
alleged
jurisdictional
defect.
he
also
has
the
ability
to
sue
plaintiff,
who
after
all
received
the
moneys
that
we
are
saying
were
illegally
or
unconstitutionally
taken
from
him.
but
nothing
in
the
due
process
clause
entitles
colonel
morton
to
shift
the
losses
of
his
legal
tactics
onto
his
employer.
the
united
states
is
simply
a
stakeholder
in
this
dispute.
we
have
complied
with
facially
valid
and
legally
binding
state
court
process,
as
we
are
required
to
do
under
statute.
it
is
not
our
responsibility
to
assert
respondent's
rights
in
court
or
to
make
him
whole
again
if
the
state
court
erred.
there
is
no
violation
of
due
process
for
a
third
party
to
rely
in
good
faith
on
a
facially
valid
state
court
judgment.
thus,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed,
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
garnishment
statute,
because
it
produces
an
absurd
result
directly
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent,
because
the
result
is
not
required
by
due
process.
unless
this
court
has
some
questions
to
ask
of
me,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
no,
your
honor.
