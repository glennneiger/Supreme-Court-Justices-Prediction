mr.
andy
coats
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ncaa
bylaws
which
control
the
televising
of
college
football
games
and
the
exclusive
network
contracts
which
govern
the
sale
of
these
rights
are
classic
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
it
is
really
doubtful
if
anyone
would
seriously
contend
they
were
even
defensible
in
any
other
context.
we
have
two
lower
courts
that
have
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
ncaa
tv
plan
and
contracts
has
been
to
fix
prices
in
the
sense
of
fixing
the-price
for
all
the
games,
fixing
the
price
of
the
individual
games,
limiting
the
availability
of
the
product,
limiting
output,
for
the
purpose
of
driving
up
the
price.
now,
at
trial
this
was
not
really
contested.
this
was
proclaimed,
that
indeed
the
network
witnesses
for
ncaa,
the
executive
director
of
ncaa,
mr.
byers,
all
said
that
if
we
didn't
have
this,
the
limitations,
if
we
didn't
have
the
plan
all
together,
that
the
networks
would
grind
down
the
prices.
and
he
said
that,
if
we
didn't
have
the
limitations
and
we
weren't
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent,
there
would
be
lots
and
lots
more
games
on
television.
and
that's
what
the
lower
courts
found.
they
found
that
indeed,
if
this
limitation
of
output,
this
limitation
on
the
number
of
games
was
not
in
place,
that
there
would
be
so
many
more
games,
mostly
on
the
basis
of
local
and
regional
circumstances.
mr.
andy
coats
well,
it
would
be
hoped,
your
honor,
that
the
networks
would
want
us.
if
we
don't
do
better
than
we
did
last
year,
they
may
not.
[laughter]
but
that
would
certainly
be
the
hope.
but
not
only
oklahoma.
the
schools,
oklahoma
and
georgia
are
in
a
situation,
for
example,
where
we
share
revenues
with
our
conference.
so
we
think
the
national
package
would
actually
decrease--
mr.
andy
coats
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
andy
coats
well,
we
think
that
that's
perfectly
legitimate,
your
honor,
for
us
to--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir,
for
us
to--
mr.
andy
coats
--right.
[laughter]
it
has
been,
both
in
the
southeast
conference,
the
university
of
georgia
and
the
university
of
oklahoma
both
share,
and
we
believe
that
additional
revenues
would
be
raised,
revenues
which
are
primarily
to
be
used
to
support
the
other
kind
of
sports--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir,
but
it's
not
exclusive
in
the
sense
that
the
other
teams
can
still
be
on.
in
fact,
the
basketball
is
probably
the
best
analogy
and
it's
one
of
the
few
times--
mr.
andy
coats
--there
is
a
game
of
the
week.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
sir.
and
we
are
still...
which
is
very
much
like
your
honor's,
the
court's,
decision
in
bmi,
because
we
have
the
safety
valve
of
being
able
to
sell
individually
on
a
horizontal
basis
to
anybody
else
that
wants
the
games
that
are
not
selected
by
the
conference,
or
by
the
ncaa,
for
that
matter.
basketball
has
been
unregulated
since
the
beginning.
basketball,
ncaa
sells--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir.
we
have
a
conference
arrangement
in
which
they
can
select
certain
games
to
be
on.
mr.
andy
coats
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
that.
mr.
andy
coats
well,
quite
honestly,
your
honor,
if
this
case
was
allowed,
if
football
was
allowed
to
be
governed
in
the
way
that
basketball
has
been,
i
think
everybody
would
leave
here
with
a
good
deal
of
satisfaction,
because
the
truth
is
that
basketball
has
been
unregulated.
mr.
andy
coats
i
don't
expect
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
andy
coats
but
the
saving
grace
would
be
that
we
would
be
able
and
all
the
schools
would
be
able
to
market
that
game
through
other
regional
and
local
television
stations.
they
wouldn't
be
foreclosed
from
being
able
to
televise
the
game
just
because
there
was
a
big
eight
game
on.
mr.
andy
coats
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
main
problem
with
the
ncaa
plan
is
the
fact
that
it
has
exclusivity
at
both
ends.
it
does
not
allow
us
or
any
schools
to
market
individually
outside
the
program
at
the
lower
end,
and
it
does
not
allow
other
networks
and
other
broadcasters
to
be
able
to
sell
their
games
at
the
top
end,
if
you
will,
of
the
way
it
works.
we
suggest
that
the
court's
decision
in
broadcast
music
is
a
good
way
to
display
what's
happening
here.
we
do
not
believe
the
court
would
have
decided
broadcast
music
as
it
had
if
all
the
composers
had
come
together
and
agreed
that
they
would
sell
only...
not
sell
outside
of
a
blanket
license
which
they
gave
to
cbs
and
that
they
would...
i
mean,
that
they
gave
to
broadcast
music,
and
they
would
ask
broadcast
music
to
go
out
and
only
sell
to
one
or
two
networks.
it's
the
exclusivity
at
the
top
and
at
the
bottom.
the
reason
the
broadcast
music
exception
to
the
per
se
rule
came
around
was
because
there
was
indeed
countervailing
forces
in
the
market,
the
ability
of
the
composers
to
sell
outside
of
that
package.
mr.
andy
coats
in
two
respects,
your
honor:
we
think
that,
first
of
all,
the
amount
of
revenues
would
be
substantially
greater
for
lots
of
schools.
mr.
andy
coats
the
revenues
would
go
to
the
colleges
that
were
on
television,
except
in
those
cases
where
there's
a
conference
situation,
where
they
go
into
the
conferences
and
then
are
redistributed.
mr.
andy
coats
i
think
that
there's
nothing
in
an
antitrust
sense,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
them
doing
that,
as
long
as
we
still
have
the
right
to
market
our
product
and
decide.
that
seems
to
me
one
of
those
internal
rules
that
is
more
political
than
antitrust.
they
may
have
trouble
getting
that
passed.
mr.
andy
coats
they
might,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
andy
coats
they
might
indeed
do
that.
but
we
think
that
is
not
something
that
they
can
or
will
do.
they
take
a
percentage
of
it
now,
and
schools
who
do
not
even
participate
in
football
obviously
benefit
to
some
degree
from
the
revenues
from
football.
mr.
andy
coats
exactly,
your
honor.
the
integration
of
rulemaking
as
far
as
the
rules
of
play
and
as
far
as
the
other
sports
are
concerned
is
very
important.
we
think
this
is
an
area
where
they
have
moved
into
the
commercial
area,
and
it's
really
the
only
area
in
regular
season
athletics
that
they
have
moved
into
commerce.
these
other
areas
are
really,
as
we
see
them,
strictly
a
rulemaking
integration
on
the
side,
and
of
the
same
order
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
society
of
professional
engineers,
in
goldfarb
versus
virginia
bar
association,
and
maricopa;
that
there
are
functions
of
that
kind
which
are
necessary.
but
we
understood
the
rules
of
this
court
to
be
that
that's
fine,
but
once
you
move
into
commerce
you
really
have
to
play
by
the
same
rules
that
everybody
else
does,
and
that
is
you
can't
fix
prices
and
you
can't
limit
output
for
the
purpose
of
enhancing
prices.
mr.
andy
coats
your
honor,
there
is
a
possibility,
i
suppose,
that
there
will
be
some
additional
national
packages,
but
they
would
be
on
a
voluntary
basis.
you
could
opt
in
or
opt
out
of
them.
there
would
not
be
the
exclusivity
that
was
involved.
the
ncaa
major
problem
has
been
the
fact
that
it
prevents
the
schools
from
being
able
to
market
those
games
that
are
not
selected.
mr.
andy
coats
we
think
that
the
prices,
that
the
total
dollars
will
be
increased,
but
the
national
package
would
probably
be
decreased
to
some
extent.
that's
the
testimony
from
the
ncaa
expert,
that
what
they
really
wanted
was
exclusivity.
and
that's
what
kept
the
national
package
up.
and
the
reason
basketball
has
worked
so
well
is
that
exact
situation,
that
lots
of
teams
were
on,
they
were
on
in
local
and
regional
areas.
the
national
package
has--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir,
they're
on
just
nearly
any
time
of
day.
mr.
andy
coats
well,
we
do
in
our
part
of
the
country,
your
honor.
i
haven't
watched
it
up
here,
but
we
do
have
lots
of
early
evening
prime
time
basketball,
even
from
the
east
coast,
on
our
various
stations
over
the
air,
which
we
think
certainly
indicates
again
what
has
happened
in
basketball;
and
the
factors
that
live
attendance
has
doubled
and
tripled
and
increased
during
the
time
that
it
was
unregulated;
that
revenues
have
doubled
and
tripled
and
been
more
spread
around
among
more
schools.
the
competitive
balance
has
never
been
better.
basketball
it
seems
to
me
is
very
important,
and
i
don't
want
to
belabor
that
point,
but
it
has
worked
very
well
along
side
of
football.
and
the
trial
court
found...
two
courts,
really,
have
found
that
what
the
national
package
did
was
build
sort
of
a
power
elite,
to
answer
justice
white's
question
a
minute
ago,
that
the
regionalization
is
a
very
wholesome
thing
and
indeed
creates
competitive
balance;
and
that
this
plan
has
had
the
effect
of
creating
the
power
elite
because
they're
the
only
teams
that
get
to
be
on
television.
and
they
said,
and
i
thought
it
was
very
interesting,
the
television
was,
that
indeed
that
notre
dame
and
southern
california
or
michigan
and
ohio
state
don't
play
well
in
kansas
against
kansas
and
kansas
state;
that
the
national
packages
indeed
lose
a
lot
of
their
glamor
because
the
local
folks
want
to
watch
the
local
teams.
and
that
of
course
has
all
kinds
of
effects
for
the
recruiting,
because
the
kids
that
are
playing
out
there,
they
want
to
be
on
television
in
their
home
town.
they're
much
more
interested
in
being
on
the
local
and
regional
games,
because
that's,
for
most
of
them,
that's
where
they'll
be
seen.
and
that
regionalization
should
have
a
very
wholesome
effect
upon
college
football
in
the
future.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
idea
that
these
are
indeed
per
se
violations,
and
we
think
they
are
and
we
think
the
point
was
made
earlier
that
market
power
is
really
unnecessary
for
this,
that
horizontal
competitors
and
colleges
compete
in
all
kinds
of
areas.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
they
did.
they
found
that
the
relevant
market
was
indeed
the
sale
of
the
rights
to
televise
college
football
games;
that
there
was
indeed
a
very
special
market
for
that;
and
that
the
ncaa
controlled
100
percent
of
it.
roughly,
they
have
virtually
all
of
the
people
who
put
on
football
on
television.
there
are
some
naia
games
that
are
on
occasionally,
but
for
the
commercial
television
portion
of
it
they
had
100
percent
of
that
market.
mr.
andy
coats
no,
your
honor,
we
think
they
are
necessary.
the
court
did
find
a
section
2
violation.
they
found--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
sir,
we
do.
that
there
was
indeed
a
section
2
violation,
the
trial
court
found
it.
mr.
andy
coats
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
it
is
not
necessary
for
section
1.
we
do
not
agree,
on
these
per
se
violations,
that
you
have
to
have
market
power.
we
think
cases
of
this
court,
in
tofco
and
in
sealy
mattress
and
in
mckesson-robbins
and
others
say
that
you
don't,
that
market
control
is
not
necessary,
market
power.
mr.
andy
coats
all
right.
then
we
have,
i
think,
your
honor,
to
go
to
what
both
lower
courts
did,
was
find
not
only
per
se
violations,
but
go
right
on
into
rule
of
reason
and
analyze
the
balance
of
restraints.
mr.
andy
coats
we
think
that
the...
well,
if
you
take
the
traditional
look
under
rule
of
reason,
it
seems
to
us
that
you
probably
would
have
to
have
market
power
in
a
relevant
market.
mr.
andy
coats
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
and
we
certainly
can
in
this
case
go
to
broadcast
music,
because
broadcast
music
we
think
supports
our
view.
and
the
balancing
of
the
various
kinds
of
anti-competitive
and
pro-competitive
effects
here
is
really
quite
remarkable.
the
idea
that
the
ncaa
can
do
all
the
things
they
do
and
really
offer
only
two
or
three
justifications...
i
mean,
they
have
fixed
prices,
they
have
limited
output,
they
have
increased
concentration
in
the
marketplace,
all
of
these
things
that
two
courts
have
found.
mr.
andy
coats
the
games,
the
games
that
are
on
television.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andy
coats
we
absolutely
do.
viewers
is...
and
his
idea
of
viewership
is
a
little
to
us
like
ridership
on
buses.
what
they're
saying
is
that
if
you
foreclose
the
sale
of
buses
and
you
fix
the
prices
on
buses
and
you
limited
the
output,
as
long
as
the
number
of
riders
of
buses
stayed
the
same
there
wouldn't
be
any
problems
in
the
market.
mr.
andy
coats
well,
viewership
has
gone
up.
demand
for
the
product
has
gone
up
over
the
years,
which
is
why
his
ideas
about
the
fact
that...
he
says
that
if
you're
a
monopolist,
if
you
have
market
power
and
you
release
more
of
the
product,
the
price
should
go
down,
but
it
has
indeed
gone
up.
and
they
postulate,
therefore,
we're
not
a
monopolist.
we
say
that's
because
the
demand...
we've
stayed
behind
the
demand
curve.
mr.
andy
coats
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
evidence
in
court
showed
that
it
was
the
contrary,
that
the
cost
per
viewer
is
higher,
two
and
a
half
times
as
high
is
it
has
been.
and
i
think
what
he's
talking
about
is
some
information
that
was
furnished
perhaps
later
and
not
available
at
trial.
but
we
think
the
cost
per
minute
has
gone
up,
and
that
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
demographics
as
far
as
the
market
is
concerned
are
expanding.
mr.
andy
coats
well,
they
generally
figure--
mr.
andy
coats
--that's
right.
and
it's
a
special
kind
of
viewer,
too.
there's
a
specific
kind
of
audience
that
they
want
to
reach,
which
is
why
the
advertisers
may
pay
more.
but
the
questions
about
the
market...
really,
we
see
ourselves
in
a
situation
of
furnishing
a
raw
product.
we
play
football
games
and
we
play
them
whether
they're
on
television
or
not
on
television.
we
sell
that
right
to
the
networks.
they
come
in
and
they
add
announcers
and
people
to
bring
color
and
instant
replay
and
music,
and
they
take
a
program
and
sell
that
to
the
advertisers.
now,
we
don't
say
that
there
may
not
be
a
market
up
there
for
advertisers,
although
they
were
very
reluctant
to
do
that.
at
trial
the
ncaa
witness
would
not
say
there
was
any
market
at
all,
and
finally
he
said,
maybe
subscription...
i
mean,
maybe
advertiser
subscribed
television
is
the
market,
that
may
be
a
market.
but
there's
also
a
market
in
the
sale
of
these
football
games,
and
it's
earmarked,
i
think,
by
the
fact
that
a
good
part
of
what
we
really
want
to
do
and
what's
involved
in
this
case
is
a
sale
where
there
are
no
advertisers
involved.
that
is,
a
sale
to
subscription
television,
a
sale
to
pay
per
view
television,
a
sale
to
cable
television,
which
is
really
where
the
ncaa
really
first
said
they
controlled
in
1981,
is
the
ability
to
extend
the
stadium--
mr.
andy
coats
--yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
andy
coats
yes,
sir,
exactly.
and
we
say
that
there
are
purchasers
of
that
raw
material
that
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
advertisers
he
talks
about.
those
indeed
make
a
market
which
is
substantially
different
than
what
we
have.
and
then
i
think
the
fact
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
international
boxing,
that
found
that
championship
boxing
was
a
separate
market
apart
from
all
boxing,
that
first
run
movies
were
indeed
a
separate
market
from
all
movies,
that
there
certainly
is
and
two
courts
have
found,
a
very
solid,
clearly
defined,
clearly
delineated
relevant
market
for
the
sale
of
the
games.
and
as
he
indicated
in
his
reply
brief
in
here,
if
that's
the
market
ncaa
can't
prevail
here,
and
we
think
that
that
certainly
is
the
market.
we
think
that
there
are
differences.
there
are
integrations,
rulemaking
integrations
that
they
make,
that
control
athletics
and
control
the
plays
of
the
games
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
they
ought
to
be
there.
where
they
get
into
commerce
as
directly
in
commerce
as
they
are
here,
they
really
ought
to
play
by
the
same
rules
that
everybody
else
does.
we
think
that
would
cause
regionalization.
we
think
that
would
increase,
as
the
courts
found,
competitive
balance.
we
think
their
attempt
to
justify
this
on
the
basis
that
it
somehow
increases
live
attendance
is
really
not
so;
that
the
courts
found
that
it
wasn't
so.
but
more
importantly,
look
what's
happened
in
the
other
sports.
professional
football
has
come
along
and
they
have
allowed
themselves
to
regionalize.
the
people
have
developed
a
following
for
the
game
and
you
can't
buy
a
ticket
in
live
attendance
to
a
professional
game.
and
that's
what
happens.
the
people
in
the
local
area
will
identify
with
the
product,
they'll
identify
with
the
school,
they'll
identify
with
the
players.
they
will
then
want
to
go
and
see
the
games
in
person,
and
indeed
it
will
enhance,
as
the
court
found--
mr.
andy
coats
--i
think
it
helps
it,
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
the
broadcasting
enhances
attendance,
live
attendance
at
the
games.
they
have
said
as
a
justification
that
it
does
not,
that
the
reason
they're
doing
this
is
to
protect
live
attendance.
we
think
the
courts
found
the
contrary
and
we
think
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
logic
and
intuition
that
that's
not
so,
that
the
ability
to
market
the
product,
and
again
we
point
to
basketball,
that
live
attendance
has
increased
substantially
while
television
has
been
totally
unlimited.
and
we
really
believe
that
the
decision
by
this
court
affirming
the
lower
courts
would
be
very
healthy
for
football,
will
indeed
cause
a
lot
of
teams
that
are
never
on
these
days
to
be
able
to
be
on,
to
display
their
wares,
their
products,
and
their
teams,
and
indeed
return
as
to
the
free
market,
which
is
where
we
think
this
matter
should
rest.
