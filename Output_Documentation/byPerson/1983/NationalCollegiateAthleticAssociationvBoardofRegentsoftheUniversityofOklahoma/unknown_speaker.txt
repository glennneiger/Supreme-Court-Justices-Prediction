unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
is
the
ncaa
a
for-profit
association
or
a
non-profit?
unknown
speaker
and
are
the
universities
that
are
members
of
it
non-profit?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
contracts
between
the
tv
networks
and
the
colleges
are
not
dependent
on
receipt
of
revenue
by
the
tv
stations.
they're
outright
flat
commitments.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
as
a
judge
who
is
an
expert
neither
in
antitrust
nor
football,
i
get
the
impression
occasionally
that
this
market
definition
thing
is
a
game
that
many
people
can
play
at.
one
person
says
a
plus
b
equals
c
is
the
equation
we
ought
to
have
to
decide
it,
and
somebody
else
says,
oh,
no,
it's
e
plus
f
equals
g.
i
get
the
impression
perhaps
that
the
first
person
to
have
a
bite
at
the
apple,
that
is
the
district
court,
frequently
can
say
what
the
rules
on
which
the
game
is
played.
unknown
speaker
could
you
spell
out
just
what
you
mean
by
manipulate
in
the
sense
you
used
it
there,
mr.
easterbrook?
unknown
speaker
are
you
using
that
in
the
same
sense
that
the
networks
can
manipulate
the
soap
opera
market,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
does
your
argument
depend...
i
think
you
said
earlier
that
viewers
or
advertising
dollars
are
essentially
fungible,
viewing
time.
i
thought
the
district
court
at
page
75a
of
the
opinion
said
something
quite
different,
that
they
pay
a
much
higher
rate
for
saturday
football
than
they
do
for
baseball
or
soap
operas.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
the
networks
want
a
higher
intelligence
group
of
people?
unknown
speaker
if
they
do
they
ought
to
change
their
commercials.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
think
maybe
more
precisely,
mr.
easterbrook,
what
i'm
asking
is,
if
the
district
court
took
the
view
that
i
just
indicated,
do
you
have
to
convince
us
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous
in
doing
so?
the
solicitor
general
argues
rather
heavily
that
maybe
you're
right
in
theory,
but
you've
got
to
contend
with
a
lot
of
district
court
findings,
and
we
don't
start
from
scratch.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
just
has
power
to
raise
the
price?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
just
has
power
to
raise
the
price?
unknown
speaker
so
what
if
the
ncaa
says
to
the
television,
when
they
put
it
out
for
bids,
they
say,
just
remember,
this
year
if
the
bids
are
only
so
and
so...
or
you're
going
to
have
to
do
better
than
a
certain
price
this
year,
which
is
considerably
more
than
last
year.
certainly
it's
been
going
up
every
year,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that's
part
of
the
market,
that's
some
evidence
of
market
power,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
they've
been
raising
the
price
and
increasing
output,
so-called,
every
year,
too.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
am
i
not
correct
in
believing
that
these
contracts
limit
the
number
of
games
that
can
be
televised?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
in
consequence
of
that
you
get
a
total
greater
aggregate
revenue
than
if
you
had
unrestricted
individual
televising
of
games?
isn't
that
a
classic
example
of
limiting
output
and
raising
a
price?
unknown
speaker
price
of
what?
now,
we're
talking
about
a
particular
game
being
televised.
if
you
had
unrestricted
television,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
the
individual
school
could
not
get
the
revenue
for
that
one
game
that
is
now
obtainable
for
one
broadcast?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
suggestion,
mr.
easterbrook,
suggests
that
the
ncaa
is
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
widgets
and
that
its
only
motive
is
to
maximize
profits.
but
if
it's
a
nonprofit
association,
might
it
not
have
other,
non-economic
goals?
unknown
speaker
why
haven't
you
argued
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
engineers
was
an
association
that
represented
people
who
were
in
business
for
profit
only.
unknown
speaker
you've
been
talking
about
now,
almost
exclusively
about
the
contracts
between
the
ncaa
and
the
networks.
do
you
have
to
talk
at
all
about
the
agreement,
the
other
agreement
that
you
mentioned
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
an
agreement
among
the
schools--
unknown
speaker
--not
to
compete
with
each
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
way
it
operates
on
a
particular
saturday,
everybody
except
the
school
who's
on
television
in
a
certain
area
has
agreed
to
stay
off
the
air.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
talk
about
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
it's
quite
long
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
it
is
quite
long
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
it
increases
its
output
of
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
are...
if
there
weren't
this
system
there
might
be
more
games,
but
there
might
not
be--
unknown
speaker
--there
might
be
fewer
viewers.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
we're
really
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
agreement
among
potential
competitors
is
always
valid
if
the
result
is
to
increase
their
gross?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
sound
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
you've
told
me
yet
is
the
justification
for
this
agreement.
unknown
speaker
you
always
arrive
at
the
same
bottom
line,
that
this
arrangement
will
increase
the
gross.
and
i'm
not
sure--
unknown
speaker
--well,
would
you...
there
are
findings,
i
suppose,
in
the
record
that,
except
for
this
arrangement,
there
would
be
more
games
on
television.
do
you
disagree
with
that
finding?
unknown
speaker
so
let's
say
there
were
twice
as
many
games
on
television,
but
there
was
only
half
the
take.
nevertheless,
how
do
you
say
that
therefore,
in
order
to
double
the
take,
it's
defensible
to
cut
the
number
of
games
in
half?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
only...
you
talk
as
though
this
were
100
percent
a
monopoly
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
just
an
agreement
among
competitors?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
you
keep
putting
this
word
"cartel"
in
it.
here
are
a
bunch
of
colleges
that
come
together,
and
suppose
they
just
say,
we
all
agree
that
we
will
only
put
80
games
on
and
we
will
never
take
less
than
a
certain
amount
for
any
of
those
games.
and
both
lower
courts
thought
this
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
are
two...
here
are
two
supermarkets
in
a
large
city,
two
chains.
they
agree
not
to
compete.
the
only
thing
is
that
neither
one
of
them
has
got
five
percent
of
the
market.
i
had
thought
that
that
is
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
is
that
right
or
not?
they
just
agree
not
to
compete,
or
they
have
a
price.
they
say,
here's
what
we're
going
to
sell
the
following
goods
at,
no
higher,
no
less.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
monopolization,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
doing
that
much,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it's
doing
more,
but
it's
doing
that
much.
and
you
have
to
say
that
it's
doing
so
much
more
that
the
arrangement
has
pro-competitive--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
know.
but
if
you
don't
get
to
that...
you
aren't
talking
very
much
about
that
if
all
you
want
to
talk
about
is
market
power.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
all
right.
i'll
read
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
oklahoma's
on
every
saturday.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
away
with
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
away
with
that?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory
of
this
case
it
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
we'll
probably
see
if
you
win
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
also
have
a
conference
basketball
game
of
the
week,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
the
conference...
but
you
negotiate
with
the
tv
people
together
for
a
game
of
the
week?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
an
agreed
upon
price,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i'm
talking
about
your
conference
arrangement.
unknown
speaker
well,
we'll
probably
see
about
that,
too.
unknown
speaker
i
would
suppose
we
would
probably
see
about
that,
too,
one
of
these
days.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
had
a
conference
football
game
of
the
week
in
the
big
eight,
i'd
almost
guarantee
you
that
oklahoma
would
not
be
on
every
week.
unknown
speaker
no.
you
probably
wouldn't
be
on
any
more
often
than
you
are
now.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
make
the
case
that
justice
white
postulated
to
you
to
prevail
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
coats,
if
you
prevail
what
would
happen
to
the
revenues
that
the
colleges
might
receive
thereafter
from
the
television
broadcasting?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
gets
the
revenues?
unknown
speaker
what
would
prevent
ncaa
from
saying,
fine,
you
sell
to
whoever
you
want
to,
but
we
get
the
revenues
if
you're
going
to
belong?
unknown
speaker
so
they
might
well
do
that
if
you
prevail--
unknown
speaker
--and
say,
fine,
you
win,
but
we'll
take
the
money?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
you
don't
want
to
just
opt
out
of
ncaa
because
you
think
that
it
offers
other
benefits
for
other
sports,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
win
in
this
case
is
there
some
chance
that
you
60
or
80
so-called
first
class
schools
will
sort
of
have
your
own
arrangements,
one
among
the
other,
something
like
the
ncaa,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
networks
would...
if
there
are
60
of
you,
you
had
your
own
organization
and
were
trying
to
negotiate
with
the
television
people,
do
you
think
the
television
people
are
going
to
pay
you
the
price
you
would
want
if
some
other
school
200
miles
away
says,
sorry,
but
we're
going
to
go
on
television,
too?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
they're
on
at
12:00
o'clock
at
night,
too,
with
basketball.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
find
nearly
as
much
prime
time
coverage
of
basketball,
i
think,
as
you
do
of
football.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
coats,
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings
about
ncaa
market
power?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
those
findings
are
necessary
to
support
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
do
think
they
are
necessary?
unknown
speaker
for
your
position?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
necessary
for
your
section
1
case?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
reject
your
per
se
case,
though?
then
where
are
you?
unknown
speaker
how
about
then?
you
have
to
have
some
market
power,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
go
to
broadcast
music?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
go
to
broadcast
music?
unknown
speaker
limited
output
of
what?
unknown
speaker
the
number
of
games
on
television?
unknown
speaker
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
view
that
output
is
to
be
measured
by
number
of
viewers
who
look
at
the
games?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
says
the
number
of
riders
goes
up
and
that's
the
best
test
of
a
competitive
market.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
says
the
price
has
gone
down
per
viewer,
as
i
understand
it.
you
don't
look
at
just
the
aggregate
amount
of
money.
it's
the
amount
of
dollars
divided
by
the
number
of
people
who
are
looking
at
the
program.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
cost
per
minute,
but
is
it
also
the
cost
per
minute
per
viewer
gone
up?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
the
cost
per
minute's
gone
up
i
assume
is
because
so
many
more
people
are
watching
the
programs.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
say
the
relevant
market
is
the
market
for
the
raw
materials,
and
he
says
the
relevant
market
is
the
market
for
the
finished
product.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
they
have
monopolized
the
market
for
the
raw
material.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
broadcasting
helps
that
attendance?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
to
disavow
any
so-called
findings
of
the
lower
courts
to
say
that
the
per
se
rule
does
not
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
differ
with
both
lower
courts
on
the
framework
in
which
you
analyze
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you?
why
do
you
differ
with
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
nice
thought.
unknown
speaker
if
the
product
is
called
football
and
the
effect
of
the
agreement
is
to
limit
output
and
drive
up
prices,
i
don't
understand
why
you
then
say
the
lower
courts
were
wrong
in
just
stopping
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
have...
they
apparently
independently
thought
the
ncaa
plan
was
illegal
because
it
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
might
have
stopped.
they
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
there
was
an
agreement
on
prices
at
which
to
sell
this
product
that
you
say
was
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
finding
that
this
is
a
price
fix.
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
followed
the
same
analysis
in
its
opinion
that
the
district
court
did?
unknown
speaker
except
we
ignore
their
conclusions
about
per
se.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
read
your
brief.
it
says--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
they
found
there
was
a
price
fix,
illegal
price
fix.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
view
to
be
that
there's
one
broad
rule
of
reason,
one
might
say,
at
one
end
of
which
and
a
species
of
a
rule
of
reason
violation
is
what
we've
often
called
per
se;
at
the
other
end
is
a
very
thorough
market
analysis;
and
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
where
you
don't
get
there
in
ten
minutes,
but
you
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way;
and
they're
still
all
one
variety
of
the
rule
of
reason?
