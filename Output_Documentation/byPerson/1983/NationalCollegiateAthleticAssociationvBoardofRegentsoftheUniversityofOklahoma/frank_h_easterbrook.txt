mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questions
in
this
case
concern
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
to
the
ncaa's
arrangements
for
the
telecasting
of
college
football.
two
agreements
are
at
issue.
one
is
the
tv
plan
adopted
by
the
ncaa's
members
and
the
other
is
a
series
of
contracts
signed
between
the
ncaa
and
the
abc,
cbs
and
turner
television
networks.
these
agreements
collectively
govern
the
tv
appearances
of
college
football
teams.
they
give
abc
and
cbs
the
right
to
broadcast
football
in
14
time
slots
each
fall,
or
roughly
one
slot
per
network
per
saturday.
they
require
each
network
to
broadcast
a
total
of
35
different
games
each
fall,
and
they
require
each
network
to
broadcast
the
games
of
at
least
82
different
teams,
different
colleges,
over
a
period
of
any
two
years.
colleges
may
telecast
games
outside
the
network
contracts
only
in
compliance
with
a
series
of
rules
called
the
exceptions
rules.
although
the
exceptions
rules
have
permitted
the
telecast
of
more
than
100
games
a
year
in
recent
years,
they
reduce
the
number
of
stations
that
can
carry
each
game
and
they
restrict
the
ability
of
colleges
to
broadcast
their
games
when
other
nearby
schools
have
not
sold
out
their
stadiums.
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
rest
on
two
principal
bases.
first
they
held
these
agreements
are
unlawful
per
se
because
they
are
horizontal
arrangements
among
competitors,
the
colleges,
to
reduce
the
output,
that
is
the
number
of
different
games
shown
on
tv.
second,
the
courts
held
they're
unlawful
under
the
rule
of
reason.
the
tenth
circuit
thought
that
the
plan
violated
the
rule
of
reason
because
only
large
networks
would
be
able
to
bid
for
these
contracts
and
that
created
objectionable
foreclosure
of
broadcasting
by
competing
tv
stations.
as
the
case
comes
here
there
are
seven
issues
before
the
court.
our
petition
presents
four
questions:
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
the
per
se
rule,
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
persuasion,
the
existence
of
market
power,
and
the
application
of
the
rule
of
reason
if
the
court
funds
market
power.
respondents
have
invoked
two
different
grounds
in
support
of
their
judgment.
they
have
argued
that
the
arrangements
are
unlawful
per
se
as
boycotts
and
as
monopolization.
and
the
solicitor
general
has
added
still
a
seventh
issue
to
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
the
court
should
replace
the
traditional
dichotomy
between
per
se
analysis
and
rule
of
reason
analysis
with
a
new
three-tier
analysis.
seven
issues
is
obviously
too
many
to
handle
in
this
oral
argument,
and
i
therefore
want
to
address
the
third
question
presented
in
our
petition,
market
power,
and
to
discuss
the
other
questions
only
as
time
permits.
i
want
to
focus
on
market
power
because
it's
the
centerpiece
of
this
case.
we
have
argued
that
the
rule
of
reason
rather
than
the
per
se
rule
applies
because
the
agreements
are
useful
in
helping
the
ncaa
and
its
members
compete
against
other
forms
of
entertainment.
what
you
think
of
that
argument
will
depend
on
what
you
think
of
our
market
power
argument.
if
you
agree
with
us
about
the
nature
of
competition
in
this
market,
it
follows
not
only
that
the
ncaa
has
no
market
power,
but
that
the
arrangements
are
pro-competitive
tools
that
help
to
compete
against
other
forms
of
entertainment.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
a
non-profit
association,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
are.
if
the
court
doesn't
agree
with
our
contentions
on
market
power,
though,
we
have
i
think
an
uphill
fight
on
the
per
se
issues,
because
most
of
our
arguments
about
how
these
arrangements
help
the
ncaa's
members
to
compete
depend
on
our
characterization
of
what
the
market
is.
market
power
is
also
the
principal
thing
separating
us
from
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
joins
us
in
arguing
that
the
per
se
rule
is
inapplicable
here
because
the
ncaa's
arrangements
are
potentially
pro-competitive.
the
solicitor
general
then
calls
for
a
novel
intermediate
tier
of
scrutiny
under
which
the
court
takes
a
quick
look
at
the
practices
in
context.
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
approach,
but
only
if
the
quick
look
starts
with
a
look
at
market
power.
market
power
is
essential
in
our
view
because
otherwise
the
courts
end
up
condemning
whatever
they
do
not
fully
understand.
here
the
lower
courts
didn't
reject
our
justifications
for
this
conduct
so
much
as
to
say
that
they
were
not
persuaded,
that
the
ncaa's
contentions
were
too
speculative,
too
open-ended,
too
uncertain
to
show
the
necessity
of
this
plan.
now,
we
think
it's
natural
for
a
judge
who's
a
novice
in
both
economics
and
the
football
business
to
be
hesitant
about
embracing
a
novel
explanation
for
why
the
ncaa
has
done
what
it's
done.
but
antitrust
is
not
opposed
to
all
complicated
practices
just
because
it's
hard
to
understand
them
or
hard
to
articulate
why
those
practices
are
carried
out.
after
all,
if
they're
banned
that
kind
of
proof
will
never
be
available.
the
market
power
test
for
which
we
argue
is
we
think
an
absolutely
essential
filter.
if
there's
no
market
power
the
practices
can't
be
anticompetitive,
and
indeed
it's
precisely
the
case
when
there
is
no
market
power
that
cooperative
practices
are
likely
to
be
most
useful
as
instruments
of
competition.
we
think
that
when
a
court
says
that
it
doesn't
really
know
why
a
business
practice
was
undertaken,
the
court
should
be
very
slow
to
hold
that
business
practice
unlawful
if
there
is
no
market
power,
and
that
it's
appropriate
to
put
the
plaintiff
to
one
of
two
burdens.
on
the
one
hand,
the
plaintiff
could
show
that
the
practices
are
never
beneficial,
and
in
that
event
the
per
se
rule
applies
and
market
power
is
irrelevant.
but
if
the
practices
have
potentially
pro-competitive
effects,
the
rule
of
reason
should
apply
and
market
power
should
be
the
initial
test
before
a
court
can
hold
those
practices
unlawful.
let
me
then
summarize
our
argument
on
market
power.
it's
this:
market
power
under
this
court's
cases
is
the
ability
to
raise
price
by
reducing
output.
that
is,
we
want
to
know
if
the
defendant
has
the
ability
to
charge
a
monopoly
price.
if
it
can't,
there's
no
antitrust
reason
to
be
concerned
about
its
practices.
and
there
is
no
way
the
ncaa
can
charge
a
monopoly
price
by
reducing
the
number
of
different
games
that
appear
on
tv.
the
television
industry
sells
viewers
to
advertisers.
that
is
the
central
commercial
transaction.
the
only
people
who
put
money
into
this
system
are
the
advertisers,
and
the
only
people
who
can
be
held
up
for
more
money
are
therefore
the
advertisers.
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record
that
advertisers
pay
only
for
viewers
actually
delivered.
they
are
buying
audience.
the
tv
networks
pay
the
suppliers
of
programs
only
to
the
extent
the
programs
summon
viewers
to
their
sets.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
are
flat
commitments,
your
honor.
but
the
amount
of
money
the
network
will
be
willing
to
pay
as
a
flat
commitment
or
a
contingent
commitment
depends
on
how
many
viewers
it
thinks
it
can
get,
and
in
fact
the
networks
are
very
sensitive
to
that,
going
into
quite
complicated
calculations
before
making
bids
based
on
the
number
of
viewers.
we
think
the
right
way
to
look
at
the
transaction
in
this
case
is
that
the
ncaa
and
its
members
supply
programs
to
television
stations
and
to
networks.
if
a
program
supplier
makes
its
programs
scarcer
or
less
attractive,
fewer
people
watch.
if
fewer
people
watch,
the
network
gets
less
money
and
it
therefore
is
willing
to
bid
less
for
the
programs.
and
therefore,
a
program
supplier
cannot
make
itself
better
off
by
reducing
its
quality
or
the
number
of
programs
it
supplies.
it
can't
get
a
higher
price
per
viewer
because
advertisers
take
the
viewers
as
essentially
fungible
and
it
therefore
has
no
market
power.
now,
that
in
a
word
is
our
whole
argument.
respondents
say
that
we
are
quibbling
with
the
lower
court's
facts
and
inferences.
but
we
think
a
lot
more
is
at
issue.
the
question,
wholly
a
question
of
law,
is
what
the
lower
courts
should
address
their
findings
to.
we
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
a
lower
court
can't
find
market
power
without
finding
that
the
defendant
has
the
ability
to
raise
the
price,
to
make
itself
better
off
by
reducing
output.
the
court
must
address
and
answer
the
question
whether
there
is
an
ability
to
enrich
the
defendant's
pockets
by
harming
consumers.
neither
lower
court
even
addressed
that
question.
in
fact,
neither
lower
court
thought
that
was
the
legally
relevant
question
to
address.
the
lower
courts
took
different,
but
in
our
view
equally
erroneous,
approaches
to
the
market
power
question.
the
district
court
said
that
it
would
decide
whether
there
was
market
power
by
defining
a
market
and
that
it
would
define
the
market
by
looking
at
what
it
is
that
plaintiffs
sell.
what
plaintiffs
sell
is
football
games.
the
university
of
oklahoma
and
the
university
of
georgia
sell
football,
not
ads.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
elasticity
in
defining
the
market,
and
that
is
one
reason
why
i
have
not
been
talking
about
the
definition
of
a
market.
in
a
sense,
you
can
define
the
market
in
this
business
as
football
games
that
appear
on
tv,
or
as
college
football
games
that
appear
on
tv
in
the
fall,
or
as
some
other
market.
our
principal
argument
is
that,
since
the
market
definition
game
is
so
easy
to
play
and
so
easily
manipulable,
that
it
is
in
cases
of
this
sort
the
wrong
game
to
play;
that
what
you
want
to
determine
is
not
a
formal
definition
of
the
market.
it
is
not
a
game
of
lexicographic
legerdemain
in
which
you
want
to
see
who
can
get
the
upper
definitional
hand.
but
instead,
the
objective
is
to
set
out
to
find
out
whether
the
defendants
really
have
the
ability
to
raise
prices
by
reducing
the
amount
of
their
output.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
by
manipulate,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean
that
the
market
definition,
the
definitional
exercise,
is
as
inevitably
arbitrary
as
any
exercise
in
definition.
in
a
sense,
it
has
to
be
right
that
there
is
a
market
in
college
football
games,
because
a
lot
of
people
specialize
in
selling
college
football
games
and
don't
sell
much
else.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
no.
i
don't
mean
that
the
participants
in
the
market
can
manipulate
it
to
their
benefit
or
to
detriment.
i
was
just
suggesting
that
market
definition,
like
any
other
definitional
exercise,
really
is
subject
to
the
humpty-dumpty
problem.
that
is,
when
i
use
a
word,
says
humpty-dumpty,
it
means
exactly
what
i
say
it
means,
neither
more
nor
less.
and
it
is
possible
to
define
almost
an
infinitely
large
number
of
markets
in
any
antitrust
case.
the
legal
question
that
we're
presenting
is
not
which
is
the
formally
correct
definition,
because
there
is
no
formally
correct
definition,
but
has
the
lower
court
tried
to
put
its
finger,
or
to
draw
a
circle
around
a
set
of
activities
that
gives
people
who
engage
in
those
activities
the
power
to
drive
up
price
by
reducing
how
much
they
sell?
and
that's
where
we
say
the
lower
courts
have
failed,
because
they
haven't
even
attempted
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that's
correct,
they
pay
a
much
higher
rate
per
thousand
viewers
per
30-minute
spot
than
they
do
for
pro
baseball.
the
question
is
what
one
makes
of
that.
as
it
turns
out,
the
data
which
we
collect
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
shows
that
they
pay
a
much
lower
rate
than
for
pro
football,
they
pay
about
51
percent
less
than
for
horse
racing,
and
131
percent
less
than
for
dynasty.
now,
as
it
turns
out,
it
is
undisputed
on
this
record
that
the
source
of
the
differential
payment
per
thousand
viewers
per
30-second
spots
is
that
people
of
different
demographic
characteristics
watch.
the
plaintiffs'
principal
expert
witness,
dr.
horowitz,
testified
at
pages
602
to
604
of
the
appendix
that
the
reason
why
the
ncaa
gets
a
higher
price
per
viewer
is
that
the
people
who
watch
have
a
higher
amount
of
education
than
the
people
who
watch
baseball.
advertisers
are
always
willing
to
pay
more
for
more
educated,
higher
income
viewers,
on
the
theory
that
they
go
out
and
buy
more.
what
you
then
have
to
answer
in
order
to
figure
out
whether
the
ncaa
has
market
power,
given
the
difference
in
these
viewers,
is
whether
there
is
something
special
about
the
ncaa's
audience.
if
they
get
a
uniquely
high
demographic
group,
then
maybe
there
is
some
ability
to
exploit
the
advertisers.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
don't
know
whether
they
want
a
higher
intelligence
person--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--justice
marshall,
i'm
not
sure
whether
intelligence
is
the
criterion
at
all,
rather
than
say
income.
if
you
try
to
ask
the
question
from
justice
stevens'
point
of
view,
ask
whether
there
is
something
special
about
these
viewers,
you
would
want
to
ask
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
just
gave
in
response.
that
is,
see
whether
there
is
a
uniquely
high
price
for
ncaa
football.
it
turns
out
that
the
answer
is
no,
that
most
of--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--well,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
we
can't
start
from
scratch
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
we're
not
asking
you
to
declare
the
district
court's
findings
clearly
erroneous.
we
asked
the
court
of
appeals
to
declare
many
of
the
findings
clearly
erroneous.
the
court
of
appeals
by
and
large
declined
to
reach
our
attacks
on
the
district
court's
findings,
because
it
had
still
another
legal
theory
about
market
power
which
it
invoked
and
then
stopped.
the
theory
that
the
court
of
appeals
invoked
on
market
power
is
principally
that
you
tell
whether
the
ncaa
has
market
power
by
seeing
whether
it
gets
a
higher
total
price
per
ad,
per
30-second
ad.
it
turns
out
the
ncaa
does
get
a
higher
total
price
per
30-second
ad
than
other
saturday
afternoon
programming,
because
the
ncaa
attracts
more
viewers.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
shows
market
power.
well,
our
argument
is
that
that
is
a
legally
erroneous
basis
for
inferring
things.
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
court
saying,
if
someone
makes
a
better
mousetrap
and
sells
more
of
the
mousetraps,
that
that
demonstrates
that
he
must
have
market
power
because
he's
getting
higher
gross
revenues.
but
that
is
as
unsupported
a
basis
for
inferring
market
power
as
one
can
come
up
with.
in
the
advertising
business
it
is
conceded
all
around
that
you
get
a
higher
price
per
ad
the
more
people
who
watch.
but
the
more
people
who
watch
is
an
increase
in
output.
if
the
ncaa
has
figured
out
some
method
to
get
the
number
of
viewers
up
from
10
million
to
20
million,
it
certainly
gets
more
viewers.
but
i
think
it
stands
antitrust
law
on
its
head
to
say
that
that's
proof
of
market
power.
the
appropriate
inference
to
draw
from
that
is
that
that's
proof
of
success
in
competition
and
increasing
one's
output.
but
let
me
come
back
to
the
method
that
we
have
tried
to
use
for
inferring
market
power.
as
i
said
earlier,
what
we
have
suggested
is
the
legal
standard
that
the
court
should
try
to
employ
is
whether
the
defendant
has
the
power
to
raise
the
price
it
charges
by
reducing
its
output,
and
that
if
the
findings
of
the
lower
courts
are
not
addressed
to--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--i'm
sorry,
justice
white,
i
didn't
hear
the
full
question.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
then
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
demonstration
of
market
power.
if
i
have
a
widget
that
i
could
sell
for
a
dollar
in
the
market,
but
being
some
fool
i
sell
it
for
90
cents,
i
then
have
the
power
to
raise
the
price,
if
everyone
else
is
selling
his
widget
for
a
dollar.
but
that
doesn't
show
market
power.
there
is
on
my
example
a
competitive
market
in
dollar
widgets,
and
it
shows
that
i
am
sacrificing
profit.
now,
it
may
be
that
i'm
the
fool,
but
the
difference
between
the
dollar
and
90
cents
doesn't
show
much.
and
i
think
that
there
is
some
of
that
flavor
in
what
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did.
they
said,
look,
the
ncaa--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--every
time
the
ncaa
has
renegotiated
a
contract,
the
price
per
exposure
has
indeed
gone
up,
although--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--no.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
fact,
justice
white,
we
think,
quite
the
contrary,
we
think
it's
evidence
of
lack
of
market
power.
the
market
power
story
is
the
story
that
the
defendant
has
the
ability
to
cut
back
its
output
and
drive
up
the
price,
and
the
reverse
of
that
is
that
if
a
defendant,
exercising
market
power,
increases
his
output
you'd
expect
the
price
to
fall.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that's
right.
they've
been
increasing
the
number
of
exposures
on
tv
and
they've
been
getting
more
money.
now,
that
is
almost
the
reverse
of
the
market
power
story.
if
they're
really
a
monopolist...
if
a
monopolist
doubles
its
output,
the
price
per
widget
falls.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor,
they
do.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
and
it
is
not
a
classic
example
of
doing
that
for
essentially
two
reasons.
one
thing
that
is
happening
is
that
these
contracts,
by
specifying
that
the
national
games
appear
on
abc-cbs
networks,
has
concentrated
the
viewers
on
those
networks,
and
therefore
obviously
the
network
price
is
up,
but
without
any
evidence
that
the
price
paid
per
viewer
is
up
relative
to
what
it
would
be.
the
price
is
up
because
the
viewers
end
up
on
the
network
program,
rather
than
scattered.
the
second
thing
that
is--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
agree
to
that.
i
keep
coming
back
to
drawing
the
distinction,
which
i
think
is
very
important
to
this
case,
between
the
price
per
game
and
the
price
per
viewer,
since
it
is,
after
all,
that
networks
are
delivering
viewers
to
advertisers.
suppose
that
the
difference
in
this
case
is
that
football
viewers,
when
turned
out,
will
fetch
$4.81
per
30-second
spot.
that's
what
the
nielson
data
suggests
that
football
viewers
fetch.
if
you
have
just
one
national
game
on
tv,
the
price
paid
for
that
game
may
be
$2
million,
because
all
the
viewers
show
up
and
watch
the
same
game.
if
instead
you
had
ten
different
games,
the
price
per
game
may
be
$200,000.
but
the
fact
that
you
end
up
with
a
higher
price
for
the
national
network
broadcast
than
for
the
local
broadcast
just
tells
you
where
the
viewers
are
concentrated,
rather
than
that
there's
any
market
power
over
the
viewers.
i
can
change
the
example
just
a
little
to
other
things
that
go
on
in
the
entertainment
industry.
when
any
packager
or
program
producer
produces
his
programs,
he
will
enter
into
some
kind
of
exclusivity
clause.
in
fact,
exclusivity
is
the
order
of
the
day
in
this
business.
when
the
producer
of
dallas
sells
his
package
to
the
network,
there
will
be
exclusivity
clauses
of
at
least
two
sorts.
one
will
be,
say,
that
only
cbs
can
show
dallas.
the
other
will
be
that
reruns
will
be
held
out
of
syndication
for
some
period
of
time,
five
years
perhaps.
and
it
turns
out
that
as
a
result
of
that
each
episode
of
dallas
collects
more
viewers
and
therefore
a
higher
price
than
it
would
if
cbs
had
a
dallas
and
abc
had
a
dallas
and
they
were
shown
head
to
head.
that
would
fracture
the
audience.
the
question
is
whether
you
would
infer
from
that
that
dallas
has
market
power,
and
we
think
not.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
in
this
record,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
coats
or
the
solicitor
general
will
say,
that
the
tv
programming
market
is
anything
other
than
cutthroat
competition,
with
hundreds,
maybe
thousands
of
program
suppliers
bidding
for
these
time
slots
on
the
network
in
order
to
supply
their
programming.
dallas
is
in
head
to
head
competition
with
everything
that
mary
tyler
moore
productions
makes.
one
of
the
things
we
learn
from
that
arrangement
is
that
exclusivity,
limiting
the
head
to
head,
dallas
versus
dallas
competition,
proves
to
be
a
wonderful
competitive
tool
in
the
market.
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
your
ability
to
advertise
dallas,
get
people
to
watch
dallas.
if
it's
on
one
network
exclusively
you
can
advertise
it.
the
failure
to
split
the
audience,
that
is
not
having
multiple
series
competing
against
one
another,
enables
you
to
spend
more
producing
and
increasing
the
quality
of
the
particular
series.
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
inferences
that
i
think
is
a
very
important
inference
in
the
market
power
question
is
that
when
all
the
producers
of
television,
essentially
all
the
sports
leagues,
the
producers
of
drama,
the
producers
of
movies,
the
producers
of
comedies,
all
engage
in
exactly
the
same
kind
of
exclusivity
arrangements
that
the
ncaa
has
engaged
in,
there
is
a
very
weak
basis
for
inferring
that
these
arrangements
are
an
exercise
of
or
a
means
of
exploiting
market
power
and
very
good
reason
for
thinking
that
that's
the
way
in
which
people
compete
in
this
market.
there
are
really
two
competing
hypotheses
here
about
what
the
ncaa
is
doing.
the
one
hypothesis
which
justice
stevens
has
brought
up
is
that
the
ncaa
has
market
power
and
it's
reducing
the
number
of
games.
but
if
we
persuade
you
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record...
and
indeed,
the
lower
courts
didn't
even
address
their
findings
to
the
question
of
whether
the
ncaa
can
increase
the
payments
per
viewer
by
reducing
the
number
of
games.
if
the
lower
courts
just
didn't
address
their
findings
to
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
one
has
to
say
that
there's
no
market
power.
and
then
the
two
different
ways
of
looking
at
this
case
change
quite
substantially.
if
the
ncaa
has
no
market
power,
then
the
plaintiff's
argument
that
the
ncaa
is
holding
games
off
tv
has
to
be
viewed
in
one
of
two
ways.
either
the
ncaa
is
cutting
its
own
throat
just
by
reducing
the
number
of
games
and
therefore
getting
its
product
shown
to
fewer
viewers
and
therefore
getting
less
total
revenue,
or
there
is
something
pro-competitive
about
these
arrangements.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
might
well,
your
honor.
as
you
know,
we
have
not
argued
that
any
educational
or
amateurism
goals
of
the
ncaa
are
a
good
reason
for
the
ncaa
to
engage
in
monopolistic
practices,
practices
that
increase
the
price
paid
by
viewers.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
haven't
argued
that
because
as
we
read
this
court's
cases,
including
engineers
and
others,
the
goals
other
than
economic
are
not
reasons
for
monopolistic
practices.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
indeed,
your
honor.
but
let
me
say
the
way
in
which
we
think
amateurism
is
relevant
in
this
market.
we
think
it
is
very
relevant
in
this
market
in
the
following
sense:
a
group
of
amateur
and
educational
nonprofit
schools
and
the
ncaa
may
well
undertake
certain
practices
which
deliberately
fail
to
maximize
its
profit.
when
the
ncaa
says,
we
are
running
programs
of
amateur
football,
it
is
probably
reducing
its
net
profits.
it
might
be
able
to
get
more
viewers
and
so
on
if
it
had
semi-professional
clubs
rather
than
amateur
clubs.
the
ncaa
might
be
able
to
increase
its
intake
if
it
abolished
or
reduced
the
academic
standards
that
its
players
must
meet.
but
we
don't
think
the
intentional
sacrifice
of
profit
is
any
objection
to
this
plan.
nowhere
is
it
written
in
the
antitrust
laws
that
everybody
has
to
maximize
profit.
what
the
antitrust
laws
do
is
provide
that
someone
can't
maximize
his
profit
by
monopolizing.
they
don't
require
someone
to
maximize
his
profit.
so
we
think
that
the
amateur
and
educational
status
of
the
ncaa
may
be
very
important
in
understanding
why
the
ncaa
would
intentionally
do
something
other
than
maximize
its
profits.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
tv
plan
among
the
members
of
the
ncaa?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
as
we
view
it,
the
tv
plan
establishes
the
contents
of
what
the
network
contracts
will
be.
the
network
contracts
are
largely
embodiments
of
the
rules
in
the
tv
plan
for
who
can--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--oh,
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
an
agreement
among
the
schools
to
engage
in
competition
in
a
particular
way,
as
we've
said.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
well,
we
talk
about
it
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
and
the
solicitor
general
also
talks
about
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
pardon?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
indeed.
our
argument
there
is
essentially
that
this
form
of
cooperative
behavior
is
a
form
of
behavior
which
influences
the
success
of
football
by
enabling
it
to
increase
its
output.
that
is,
it
apportions
viewers,
viewership
opportunities--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--its
output
of
games
and
viewers.
the
spreading
of
tv
appearances
makes
it--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--there
might
be
fewer
viewers,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
therefore
reduced
output.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that's
what
we're
really
talking
about,
that
an
increase,
short-term
increase
in
the
number
of
games--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--no.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no.
[laughter]
and
we
contend
nothing
of
the
sort,
your
honor.
an
agreement
among
competitors
that
just
increases
their
gross
by
reducing
their
output
is
monopolistic.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i'm
sorry.
let
me
try
to
be
a
little
more
precise.
one
of
the
things
that
this
agreement
does,
your
honor,
is
to
require
each
of
the
networks
to
show
82
different
teams
over
a
period
of
two
years.
in
an
amateur
football
market
where
the
colleges
cannot
bid
for
players
by
offering
them
higher
salaries,
where
players
go
depends
substantially
on
a
combination
of
the
scholastic
program,
the
exposure
on
tv,
the
recruiting
opportunities,
and
so
on.
the
ability
of
the
ncaa
to
produce
quality
football
that
people
want
to
watch
depends
on
having
high
quality
rivalry
on
the
field.
one
of
the
things
this
arrangement
does
is
to
increase
the
number
of
different
schools
who
will
attract
students,
attract
high
quality
players,
increase
the
rivalry
on
the
field,
and
therefore
make
each
game
a
more
exciting
thing
to
watch.
that's
what
ends
up
increasing
the
number
of
people
who
watch
and
increasing
output
in
this
market.
it
is
cooperation,
but
not
monopolistic
cooperation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
distinction
we're
trying
to
draw
is
between
increasing
the
gross
by
cutting
back
your
output
and
monopolizing,
and
increasing
the
gross
by
improving
the
quality
of
your
product
and
getting
more
people
to
watch.
the
former
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
latter
we
think
is
pro-competitive
and
beneficial.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
do
not
disagree
with
that
finding.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
monopoly
question
is
whether
the
ncaa
can
increase--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it's
been
argued
as
a
cartel
case
and
a
monopolization
case
and
a
variety
of
other
ways.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
view
that
as
stating
a
claim
under
section
1
of
sherman
for
cartel
behavior.
but
as
you
well
know
from
the
broadcast
music
case,
not
all
agreements
among
competitors
are
cartel
behavior.
whether
this
is
a
cartel
is
a
legal
conclusion
and
not
a
fact.
one
has
to
figure
out,
as
in
broadcast
music,
whether
this
is--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--i
understand
that.
but
if
there
is
no
market
power
that
can't
be
a
per
se
violation,
we
think,
because
suppose
all
that
happens
is
that
i
produce
wheat.
if
i
stand
up
and
say,
i'm
going
to
produce
half
as
much
wheat
as
before
and
charge
a
higher
price,
i'm
not
going
to
get
away
with
it.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
all
they
do
is
agree
not--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--it's
clearly
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
have
never
had
any
doubt
about
that.
but
the
ncaa
is
doing
a
great
deal
more
than
just
agreeing
not
to
compete.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
ncaa--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--exactly,
as
we've
been
trying
to
say,
as
in
broadcast
music.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
no.
justice
white,
we
have
not
abandoned
in
any
way
the
first
two
arguments
we
made
in
the
brief.
i
just
thought
that
this--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--thank
you.
[laughter]
