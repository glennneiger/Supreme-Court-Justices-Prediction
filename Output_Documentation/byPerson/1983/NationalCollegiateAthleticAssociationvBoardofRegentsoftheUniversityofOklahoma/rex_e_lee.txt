mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
courts:
i
submit
that
the
one
thing
that
should
be
apparent
by
now
is
that,
regardless
of
the
path
by
which
the
result
is
reached,
whether
it's
per
se
violation;
full-blown
rule
of
reason
analysis,
or
a
more
carefully
tailored
rule
of
reason
middle
ground,
it
should
be
apparent
that
the
sherman
act
has
been
violated.
two
federal
courts
have
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
ncaa
tv
plan
restricts
output.
now,
there
is
this
debate
over
whether
viewership
is
really
restricted
or
enhanced.
it
all
ties
back
to
a
citation,
a
reference
in
the
reply
brief
back
to
our
brief.
the
reply
brief
quotes
our
brief
as
saying:
"the
exclusivity
factor
of
the
package
allows
the
chosen
few
networks
to
deliver
larger
audiences.
"
that
occurs
at
the
top
of
page
19
of
our
brief.
the
larger
audiences
to
which
we
are
referring,
consistent
with
the
findings
of
two
lower
courts,
is
the
larger
audience,
the
larger
audiences
for
those
few
games
that
are
subject
to
the
exclusive
package,
and
that
of
course
is
larger.
that
is
the
very
purpose
of
price-fixing
and
restriction
of
output.
but
there
is
no
finding
in
the
record
concerning
total
viewership.
i'd
like
to
concentrate
on
the
narrow
difference
between
the
ncaa's
position
and
the
government's
position,
because
i
believe
it
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
the
area
of
agreement,
in
the
ncaa's
words,
is
that
it
accepts
our
framework
for
analysis.
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
what
that
accepted
framework
is.
our
experience
as
the
principal
enforcers
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
that
the
identification
of
unlawful
restraints
of
trade
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
requires
more
than
just
two
polar
extremes.
the
per
se
rule
on
the
one
hand,
which
is
simply
a
special
case
of
application
of
the
rule
of
reason,
is
too
limiting.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
petitioner
agrees
with
us
that
the
full-blown
rule
of
reason
analysis
often
opens
the
door
to
virtually
unlimited
discovery
and
introduction
of
evidence
of
every
conceivable
effect
the
defendant's
practice
might
have
on
competition.
we
believe
that
what
is
needed
is
not
a
novel
rule,
but
is
rather
what
is
already
reflected
not
only
in
this
court's
broadcast
music
and
professional
engineers
decisions,
but
also
in
the
common
sense
underpinnings
of
the
rule
of
reason
itself,
that
the
rule
occupies
the
entire
spectrum
of
inquiry
into
effect
on
competition
and
not
just
the
two
end
points
of
that
spectrum.
and
this
is
the
framework
for
analysis
which
the
ncaa
accepts.
the
narrow
point
of
disagreement
is
that
in
the
ncaa's
view
the
tailored
rule
of
reason
approach
always
requires
a
showing
of
market
power
and
in
this
particular
case
it
specifically
requires
a
showing
that
the
ncaa
has
market
power
over
advertisers.
that
point
of
disagreement
is
squarely
controlled
by
the
factual
findings
of
two
federal
courts.
first,
in
this
case
the
lower
courts
did
address
the
issue
of
market
power.
they
did
find
a
relevant
market.
it
is
the
television
market
for
college
football.
they
also
found
that
the
restriction
at
issue
in
this
case
restricts
output,
that
the
restriction
of
output
drives
up
the
price,
as
classical
economics
would
teach
that
it
will,
and
that
the
justifications
asserted
by
the
ncaa
are
factually
inadequate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
do
i
have
to
disavow
any
findings
to
say?
no.
all
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
of
our
interest
in
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
our
experience
has
taught
that
the
application
of
the
per
se
rules
in
an
area
where
there
are
legitimate
areas
of
cooperative
endeavor
has
the
effect
of...
has
the
opposite,
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
effect
that
was
intended
by
the
per
se
rule,
which
is
that
the
courts
shy
away
from
using
shortcuts
and
presumptions
in
those
areas
where
shortcuts
and
presumptions
are
in
order.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
say
the
lower
courts
were
not
wrong
in
stopping
there.
we
say
that
what
the
lower
courts--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
say
that
the
point
at
which
they
should
have
stopped...
this
is
simply
a
demonstration
of
our
view
that
it
does
occupy
the
entire
spectrum.
the
point
at
which
they
should
have
stopped
was
the
point
at
which
they
determined
that
it
does
restrict
output
and
drives
up
the
price,
and
that
there
were
no
justifications.
that
is
the
point
at
which
they
should
have
stopped.
now,
if
you
want
to
call
that
per
se,
so
be
it.
the
problem
is
that
many
of
the
lower
courts
are
identifying
those
two
extremes
as
simply
located
too
far
away
from
each
other,
without
sufficient
flexibility
in
the
middle.
but
that
is
precisely
our
point,
that
the
stopping
point
in
this
case
should
have
been
the
point
at
which
the
lower
courts
determined
that
output
was
restricted
and
that
the
price
was
driven
up.
now,
the
market
can
be
a
helpful
guide
in
determining
that
ultimate
issue,
whether
there
has
been
a
restriction
of
output.
but
the
market
is
not
the
ultimate
inquiry.
the
ultimate
inquiry
is
whether
there
has
been
a
restriction
of
output.
the
market--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
is
no
evidence
to
that
in
the
record
and
i
think
there
probably
was
not.
but
there
was
an
agreement--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
agree
with
it
or
disagree
with
it.
what
i
do
agree
with
is
mr.
easterbrook's
proposition
that
the
sherman
act
is
violated
when
output
has
been
restricted,
and
that
is
price-fixing
for
section
1
sherman
act
purposes,
when
you
restrict
output
with
the
effect
of
driving
up
the
price.
and
that
is
what
they
agreed
to
do,
was
to
restrict
output
and
as
a
result
of
that
restriction
of
output
the
price
was
driven
up,
and
that
is
exactly
what
two
lower
courts
have
held.
i
find
it
anomalous,
to
say
the
least,
that
the
ncaa
would
argue
on
the
one
hand,
as
i
think
they
really
have
to,
that
there
is
a
certain
sleight
of
hand
problem
with
market
definition
and
that
it
is
capable
of
being
applied
either
microscopically
or
virtually
throughout
the
galaxies,
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
argue
that
market
power
is
the
sine
quo
non
for
the
application
of
what
they
agree
with
us
should
be
a
more
flexible,
a
more
tailored
approach
to
rule
of
reason
analysis.
the
dispositive
fact
is
that
in
this
particular
case
the
ncaa
takes
one
view
of
what
the
market
is
and
one
view
of
whether
there
has
or
has
not
been
restriction
of
output.
the
colleges
take
another
view
of
what
the
market
is
and
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
restriction
of
output.
both
of
those
views
have
been
submitted
to
two
lower
courts
with
all
of
the
supporting
evidence
and
those
courts
have
made
their
decisions,
and
the
decisions
have
been,
yes,
there
was
a
restriction
of
output,
it
had
the
effect
of
driving
up
the
price,
and
in
both
instances
they
agreed
that
that
analysis
was
supported
by
a
relevant
market.
in
any
event--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--not
precisely.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
is
closer
to
ours.
in
any
event,
even
if
you
could
ignore
the
two
court
rule,
which
of
course
it
should
not
be
ignored,
the
market--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
justice
white,
you...
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
the
conclusions,
yes.
but
i'm
talking
about
findings.
i'm
talking
about
findings.
we
disagree
with
their
conclusion--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
at
that
point
they
should
have
stopped.
that
makes
it
per
se.
and
if
that's
what
you
want
to
clarify
as
being
the
per
se
trigger,
then
fine.
but
the
problem
is,
i
reiterate
once
again,
when
we
talk
of
it
only
in
terms
of
per
se
at
one
extreme
end
and
rule
of
reason
at
the
other
extreme
end,
we
leave
out
the
concept
that
there
is
a
broad
middle
ground.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
precisely,
precisely.
and
at
any
point
along
that
spectrum
you
can
identify
points
at
which
you
say,
at
this
point
we
have
a
shortcut,
at
this
point
we
have
a
presumption.
and
at
the
point
where
you
reach
a
determination
that
output
has
been
restricted
with
the
effect
of
driving
up
the
price,
that's
the
stopping
point.
and
i
don't
care
what
label
you
put
on
it.
but
the
other
concept
that
will
be
helpful
to
us
as
antitrust
enforcers
is
to
make
very
clear
that
the
rule
that
you
just
articulated
very
well
really
is
what
the
sherman
act
section
1
really
means.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
other
questions.
