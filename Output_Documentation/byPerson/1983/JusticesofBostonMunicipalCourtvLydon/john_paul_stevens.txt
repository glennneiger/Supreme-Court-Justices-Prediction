may
i
ask
just
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
maximum
range
of
sentencing
at
the
jury
trial
precisely
the
same
as
at
the
first
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
at
either
stage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
really,
that
question
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it,
because
the
federal
courts
found
an
insufficiency
of
evidence,
and
you
don't
challenge
that
for
purposes
of
the
cert
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
assume
for
purposes
of
our
problem
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
if
in
this
case
the
defendant
had
not
asked
for
the
jury
trial,
say
he
had
accepted
the
verdict
of
guilty
and
let
the
time
run
on
it,
then
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
if
the
record
is
as
we
now
believe
it
to
be,
he
would
be
a
free
man?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
he
not
be
in
custody
if
you
let
the
time
run?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
was
the
sentence
this
man
received?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
he
had
let
the
time
for
the
jury
trial
expire,
then
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
and
if
he
is
right
about
the
record,
he
would
be
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rossman,
may
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
a
non-legal
question?
if
you
are
right
here,
it
seems
to
me
that...
and
if
the
first
circuit
is
right,
that
it
would
become
rather
standard
practice
for
a
defense
counsel
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
stage
of
the
two-tier
stage
immediately
to
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
ask
the
federal
court
to
review
the
district
court
record.
maybe
that
is
what
the
law
requires,
but
if
it
is,
it
is
going
to
really
make
a
very
significant
practical
difference,
i
suppose,
in
the
procedure
in
massachusetts,
and
i
am
wondering
if
you
might
address
the
possibility
of
some
sort
of
comity
and
federalism
notion
of
saying,
well,
the
federal
court
ought
to
stay
its
hand
until
the
review
has
been
had
in
the
massachusetts
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
confident
such
a
waiver
would
create
no
problem.
supposing
you
asked
them
to
waive
their
right
to
a
lawyer.
would
that
be
valid?
or
suppose
the
state
asked
them,
not
you.
can
we
confidently
assume...
maybe
we
don't
have
to
decide
it...
that
a
waiver
provision
would
both
have
the
practical
consequences
you
say
and
not
present
any
legal
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
defendant
ever
have
fair
notice
that
the
state
is
not
going
to
have
any
evidence
of
guilt?
basically,
he
doesn't
know
what
the
options
are
going
to
be
until
he
has
seen
the
state's
evidence.
