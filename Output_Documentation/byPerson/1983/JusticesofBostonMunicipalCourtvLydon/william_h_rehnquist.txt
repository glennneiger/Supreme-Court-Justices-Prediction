justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
smith,
what
is
the
difference
in
courts
between
the
one
where
the
bench
trial
takes
place
and
the
one
where
the
jury
trial
takes
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
in
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--different
divisions
of
the
municipal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
smith,
are
concessions
such
as
those
that
you
have
been
talking
about
with
my
colleagues
fairly
common
for
the
sake
of
enabling
the
single
justice
to
certify
a
pure
question
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
are
two
different
questions.
one
is
whether
he
is
in
custody,
and
the
second
is
whether
he
has
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
consequences,
ms.
smith,
if
after
the
bench
trial
and
after
the
defendant
convicted
in
a
bench
trial
made
his
election
to
have
a
jury
trial,
if
a
couple
of
the
witnesses
died,
and
the
state
simply
didn't
have
any
evidence
to
go
ahead
with
the
jury
trial?
would
the
bench
trial
have
any
effect,
the
judgment
of
the
bench
trial
have
any
effect,
or
would
he
simply--
--no,
once
he
opts
for
the
de
novo
trial,
and
if
we
make
the
determination
that
we
have
no
evidence,
we
would
have
to
null
prosse
the
proceedings.
even
though
there
had
been
a
conviction
at
the
bench
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rossman--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
correct,
mr.
rossman?
i
understood
from
your
opposing
counsel
that
he
could
have
appealed
the
bench
trial
decision
to
the
massachusetts
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
is
no
direct
appeal
then
from
the
bench
trial
to
any
other
massachusetts
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rossman,
supposing
that
instead
of
this
two-tier
system
which
we
have
been
talking
about
here
coming
from
massachusetts,
you
simply
had
a
trial
in
the
massachusetts
superior
court
of
a
felony,
and
the
defense
lawyer
makes
a
motion
at
the
close
of
the
prosecutor's
evidence
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
trial
court
denies
it,
and
he
puts
on
later...
the
defendant
later
puts
on
evidence
in
his
own
case.
the
case
goes
to
the
jury,
and
the
jury
hangs.
now,
do
you
think
that
the
defendant
at
that
point
can
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
and
say,
i
can't
be
retried
here
because
the
prosecutor
never
put
on
enough
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief
to
support
the
sort
of
finding
that
you
say
a
court
has
to
make
under
jackson
against
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
does
that
help
answer
my
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
nonetheless
it
could
intervene
if
it
wanted
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
the
court,
say,
in
steffanelli
against
manard,
had
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
express
any
view
as
to
whether
mr.
lydon
on
the
evidence
presented
might
have
been
guilty
of
some
other
crime
under
massachusetts
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
massachusetts,
like
the
federal
government,
like
most
other
states,
has
some
doctrine
of
amendment
of
the
information,
amendment
of
charge,
and
constructive
amendment
on
occasion,
if
it
is
consented
to
by
allowing
evidence
to
come
in.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
you
are
talking
about
his
innocence,
you
have
to
define
the
term
fairly
narrowly.
