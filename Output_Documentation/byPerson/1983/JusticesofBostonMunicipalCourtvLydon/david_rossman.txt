mr.
david
rossman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
prosecution
of
michael
lydon
at
his
second
trial,
which
is
pending,
following
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts'
failure
to
present
a
rational
basis
for
his
conviction
at
his
original
trial
is
exactly
the
type
of
overreaching
conduct
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
it
is
clear
that
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
placed
michael
lydon
once
in
jeopardy
when
it
charged
him
with
a
crime,
presented
witnesses,
cross
examined
the
witnesses
that
mr.
lydon
put
forward
at
his
original
trial.
the
prosecutor
had
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
at
that
original
trial
to
present
whatever
evidence
existed
to
convince
the
judge
that
michael
lydon
had
committed
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged.
mr.
lydon
has
established,
your
honor,
in
both
federal
courts,
and
it
is
not
contested
here
because
it
is
not
one
of
the
questions
that
the
commonwealth
asked
this
court
to
consider
in
its
certiorari
petition,
that
the
evidence
at
that
original
bench
trial
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
this
court--
mr.
david
rossman
--the
crime
with
which
mr.
lydon
was
charged,
your
honor,
was
possession
of
various
items
that
the
commonwealth
alleged
were
burglars'
tools,
with
the
intent
to
use
those
tools
to
break
into
a
depository
in
order
to
steal
property
that
was
secured
inside
the
depository,
and
massachusetts
state
law
clearly
establishes
that
in
order
to
convict
someone
of
that
crime,
the
commonwealth
must
present
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
property
inside
of
a
car
if
a
car
is
alleged
to
be
the
depository
in
order
to
establish
the
intent,
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
property
inside
that
car,
your
honor,
just--
mr.
david
rossman
--well,
your
honor,
the
defendant
loses
if
the
commonwealth
establishes
that
any
rational
person
looking
at
that
evidence,
giving
all
of
the
benefits
of
credibility
to
the
prosecution,
and
drawing
every
reasonable
inference
from
the
evidence,
if
the
commonwealth
can
meet
that
bare
minimum
standard
that
the
defendant
is
guilty,
and
a
judge
finds
him
guilty,
the
defendant
loses.
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
a
case--
mr.
david
rossman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
no,
i
am
not.
what
we
have
here,
your
honor,
is
a
situation
where
both
federal
courts
have
found
that
no
rational
person
could
have
looked
at
that
evidence,
no
rational
person,
and
concluded
that
michael
lydon
had
committed
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged,
and
the
situation
mr.
lydon
finds
himself
in
is,
if
his
double
jeopardy
claim
doesn't
have
merit
after
the
first
tier
of
the
de
novo
system
is
finished,
how
can
he
win?
he
has
been
convicted
without
proof
irrationally,
and
his
only
alternatives
at
that
point
which
the
state
gives
him
are,
on
the
one
hand,
go
to
jail
for
two
years;
on
the
other
hand,
allow
the
prosecutor,
because
that
is
the
only
remedy
we
will
give
you,
a
second
opportunity
in
the
de
novo
trial.
mr.
david
rossman
your
honor--
mr.
david
rossman
--no,
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
david
rossman
he
didn't--
mr.
david
rossman
--mr.
lydon
did
not
agree
in
advance
that
he
would
give
up
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
this
court
explained
it
in
burks,
and
if
i
may
expound
on
that--
mr.
david
rossman
--i
think
it--
mr.
david
rossman
--no,
it
was
probably
a
decision
made
by
the
lawyer,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
david
rossman
--as
it
existed
at
the
time.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
worthwhile
to--
mr.
david
rossman
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
rossman
yes,
he
did,
your
honor,
because
his
only
alternative
at
that
point
was
to
accept
a
two-year
jail
sentence
on
a
conviction.
mr.
david
rossman
no,
your
honor.
the
only
remedy
that
massachusetts
gives
someone
convicted
in
the
first
tier
of
the
de
novo
system
is
to
ask
for
a
second
trial.
state
law
establishes
in
a
case
called
commonwealth
versus
whitmarsh
that
you
may
not
seek
extraordinarily
relief
or
any
sort
of
appellate
review,
common
law
or
statutory
or
otherwise,
from
a
conviction
in
the
first
tier
except
by
giving
the
prosecutor
a
second
chance.
to
return
to
your
question--
mr.
david
rossman
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
no,
there
isn't.
the
only
possibility
would
be
to
ask
a
single
justice
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
to
exercise
his
superintendent's
power,
which
mr.
lydon
did
here.
mr.
david
rossman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
yes,
i
believe
it
would
have,
your
honor,
and
this,
i
believe,
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
question
that
justice--
mr.
david
rossman
--in
a
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
that's
basically
it,
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
having
a
judge
merely
inform
something
to
mr.
lydon
which
any
judge
and
any
lawyer
in
massachusetts
would
have
known.
in
answering
your
question,
justice
marshall,
about
what
a
lawyer
would
have
told
michael
lydon,
i
believe
it
appropriate
to
ask
the
court
to
consider
what
advice
it
would
have
wanted
a
competent
defense
attorney
to
give
michael
lydon
when
he
had
to
make
that
election
to
participate
in
the
de
novo
system
or
not
in
1980.
burks,
your
honor,
had
been
decided
a
little
bit
over
a
year
ago.
there
had
been
no
decision
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
saying
whether
burks
applied
to
the
de
novo
system
or
not.
however,
although
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
highest
court
in
massachusetts,
there
was
every
indication
elsewhere
in
the
massachusetts
system
that
burks
in
fact
did
apply.
in
particular,
there
were
three
opinions
by
trial
judges
in
the
second
tier
of
the
de
novo
system.
each
of
those
three
opinions
said,
yes,
the
burks
interpretation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
applies
to
the
de
novo
system.
in
addition,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
had
decided
in
1978
a
case,
and
it
is
cited
in
the
amicus
brief,
your
honor,
at
page
12,
costarelli
versus
commonwealth,
in
which
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
that
an
individual
who
goes
on
trial
in
the
first
tier
of
the
system
and
faces
a
judge
who,
when
hearing
insufficient
evidence,
dismisses
the
case
and
then
orders
a
prosecutor
to
bring
a
different
charge
which
would
more
closely
fit
the
evidence
that
the
judge
heard,
that
in
those
circumstances
a
massachusetts
defendant
can
raise
a
double
jeopardy
motion
to
dismiss
if
he
is
again
charged
with
a
crime,
and
if
necessary,
he
can
go
to
a
single
justice
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
prior
to
his
second
trial
in
order
to
get
relief
from
a
double
jeopardy
claim
because
the
state's
highest
court
recognized
that
double
jeopardy
protects
individuals
from
the
risk
of
having
to
undergo
a
trial,
not
just
from
convictions.
against
that
background,
your
honor,
i
submit
it
would
have
been
reasonable
for
an
attorney
to
conclude
and
to
advise
a
client
who
wished
to
have
that
type
of
sophisticated
advice
that
ordinarily
if
you
choose
the
de
novo
system,
your
only
remedy
is
a
second
trial.
however,
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
prosecutor
does
not
present
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
you,
but
the
judge
for
some
reason
irrationally
convicts
you,
that
we
may
raise
this
point
and
this
point
only
by
way
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
second-tier,
and
apart
from
the
fact,
your
honor,
that
that
is
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
that
one
can
draw
from
the
record,
and
it
is
in
fact
the
conclusion
about
mr.
lydon's--
mr.
david
rossman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
well,
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that
that
is
all
that
is
available
for
one
to
look
at,
i
think
it
goes
to
another
point
that
was
made
by
ms.
smith,
and
that
is,
the
prospect
that
federal
courts
would
be
inextricably
interwoven
with
state
criminal
justice
system
because
of
claims
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
and
the
brevity
of
the
record
if
it
is
relevant
to
any
extent,
i
think,
only
goes
to
show,
your
honor,
that
these
questions
are
quite
easily
decided,
because
the
transcript
in
this
case
is
typical
of
a
transcript
that
might
result
from
any
trial
in
the
first
tier
of
the
process.
mr.
david
rossman
i
believe
that
a
federal
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
a
petition,
and
then
i
suggest
a
federal
district
court
should
entertain
the
same
type
of
analysis
of
the
equities
of
the
situation
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
stay
its
hand
or
not,
that
the
first
circuit
demonstrated
in
this
case.
the
first
circuit,
i
submit,
your
honor,
was
clearly
cognizant
of
the
caution
it
should
take
in
interfering
with
an
ongoing
state
criminal
trial
pursuant
to
the
younger
doctrine,
and
the
court
looked
at
various
factors
that
were
unique
to
this
case.
mr.
david
rossman
well,
to
the
extent
that
an
individual
in
the
situation
you
posed
was
different
from
mr.
lydon
because,
for
example,
he
had
not
fully
litigated
the
issue
that
he
was
attempting
to
raise
in
the
federal
district
court
in
the
state
system,
that
might
be
a
factor
cautioning
a
federal
court
to
stay
its
hand.
mr.
david
rossman
it
would
have
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
to
intervene,
and
it
would
be
a
question
of
exercising
restraint
by
giving
deference
to
policies
of
federalism.
mr.
david
rossman
i
don't
have
the
facts
of
that
case
sufficiently
at
mind
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor.
the
implications
of
the
commonwealth's
failure
of
proof
at
the
initial
trial
call
into
question
a
central
feature
of
what
this
court
has
identified
as
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
that
is
a
tenet
that
limits
the
prosecutor
to
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
show
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
massachusetts
had
that
opportunity
and
didn't
do
so
here,
and
its
second
attempt,
if
it
is
permitted
to
place
mr.
lydon
twice
in
jeopardy
by
forcing
him
to
undergo
the
de
novo
trial,
raises
a
concern
for
the
value
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
implements
in
protecting
innocent
individuals.
mr.
lydon
established
in
both
federal
courts
that
the
only
rational
view
of
the
transcript
is
that
one
faithfully
applying
the
standard
of
law
that
the
due
process
clause
embodies
must
conclude
he
deserved
to
go
free.
even
judge
campbell,
who
dissented
in
the
first
circuit,
stated
in
his
opinion
there
was
probably
no
effective
way
for
a
prosecutor
to
supply
evidence
that
mr.
lydon
committed
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged.
if
anyone,
i
submit,
your
honor,
deserves
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
it
protects
innocent
defendants,
mr.
lydon
deserves
that
protection.
mr.
david
rossman
yes,
judge
briar
suggested
that
mr.
lydon
was
probably
guilty
of
some
other
crime,
and
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
however,
your
honor,
no
one
seriously
contests
that
a
state
may
charge
an
individual
with
one
crime,
fail
to
prove
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged,
and
yet
place
him
in
jail
because
he
might
have
been
shown
to
have
committed
a
separate
crime.
mr.
david
rossman
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
that
was
exactly
the
topic
of
justice
wilkins'
opinion
as
a
single
justice.
the
prosecutor
went
in
before
a
single
justice
and
filed
a
memorandum
which
was
part
of
the
record
in
the
district
court,
and
that
memorandum
stated,
"the
commonwealth
concedes
that
on
the
complaint
as
written
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
"
and
then
cited
in
that
memorandum
the
very
case
that
mr.
lydon's
defense
attorney
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
the
rest
of
the
commonwealth's
memorandum
went
on
to
say,
however,
at
this
point
in
the
proceeds,
we
can
now
either
amend
the
complaint
to
conform
to
the
crime
we
think
we
proved,
or
ask
the
court
to
construe
the
papers
applying
for
the
complaint
as
part
of
the
charging
document,
and
justice
wilkins,
for
the
balance
of
his
opinion,
went
on
to
say,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
would
be
an
amendment
of
substance.
it
would
charge
a
completely
different
crime.
the
prosecution
may
not
do
that.
the
prosecution
must
prove
mr.
lydon
guilty
of
the
crime
that
it
alleged
in
the
original
complaint.
mr.
david
rossman
in
the
only
sense
in
which
i
believe,
your
honor,
a
system
that
protects
the
due
process
rights
of
individuals
makes
relevant,
and
that
is,
are
you
innocent
of
the
crime
with
which
you
are
charged?
as
a
defense
attorney,
i
would
hate
to
have
to
get
up
and
argue
that
someone
was
innocent
of
all
crimes
for
all
time
in
order
to
gain
an
acquittal.
mr.
david
rossman
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
there
will
be
a
flood
of
habeas
corpus
petitions
if
the
first
circuit's
decision
is
upheld,
for
several
reasons.
first,
your
honor,
as
for
the
future,
massachusetts
has
stated
that
it
will
require
individuals
who
opt
to
participate
in
the
de
novo
system
to
expressly
waive
their
double
jeopardy
rights
as
a
condition
of
participating
in
the
de
novo
system.
so,
as
for
individuals
who
are
part
of
the
massachusetts
two-tier
system
from
now
on,
they
won't
have
a
federal
claim
that
they
have
been
without
their
knowing
consent
deprived
of
the
protection
of--
mr.
david
rossman
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
you
did
get
a
negative
answer,
and
i
would
just
call
to
the
court's
attention
page
68
of
the
commonwealth's
brief,
where
there
is
a
quote
from
a
case
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
decided
after
the
first
circuit
decision,
but
before
you
granted
cert,
commonwealth
versus
montanez,
and
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
said
is
that
upon
a
certain
interim
period,
28
days,
from
the
decision
in
montanez,
a
waiver
of
a
claim
of
double
jeopardy
shall
be
obtained,
at
the
same
time
as
the
waiver
that
someone
has
to
file
to
participate
in
the
de
novo
system.
there
is,
your
honor,
an
example
of
the
kind
of
form
that
the
montanez
court
contemplates
attached
to
my
opposition
to
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
i
could
represent
to
the
court
that
as
of
today,
when
individuals
choose
to
participate
in
the
de
novo
system
in
massachusetts,
they
sign
a
form,
and
a
sentence
on
the
form
says,
i
agree
to
waive
any
right
i
have
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
or
language
to
that
effect.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
believe
in
the
future
it
will
be
a
problem.
mr.
david
rossman
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
that
one
can
take
the
idea
of
waiver
to
its
logical
extreme.
there
certainly
must
be
some
minimum
standards
of
due
process
that
a
state
must
incorporate
in
a
de
novo
system,
even
if
it
offers
someone
an
alternative
procedure
it
can
use
to
avoid
the
de
novo
trial.
it
is
not
mr.
lydon's
position
here
today
that
the
burks
protection
is
one
of
them
if
someone
has
fair
notice
beforehand--
mr.
david
rossman
--no,
it
is
a
question
of
accepting
a
risk
if
something
eventuates,
your
honor,
and
what
you
need
fair
notice
of
is
some
position
by
the
state
court
saying,
if
in
fact
the
trial
judge
irrationally
convicts
you,
you
understand
that
as
a
condition
of
the
de
novo
system
you
allow
the
prosecutor
to
do
that
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
ordinarily
prohibits,
and
that
is
to
hone
his
strategy,
perfect
his
evidence,
improve
his
position,
and
gain
possibly
a
sufficient
case
to
convict
an
individual
where
you
didn't
the
first
time,
and
i
suggest
that
mr.
lydon
did
not
have
fair
warning
that
that
might
be
the
case
in
his
trial,
and
the
position
this
court
now
confronts
is
the
prospect
of
a
second
trial
where
the
prosecutor
will
gain
that
advantage,
and
the
court
must
recognize,
as
it
has
recognized
in
the
past,
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
by
prohibiting
that
second
effort,
guards
innocent
individuals
against
the
possibility
of
unfair
or
perhaps
inaccurate
convictions.
mr.
david
rossman
i
would
suspect
that
a
great
defendants
would
opt
nevertheless
to
go
to
majority
to
the
first
trial.
to
the
extent,
however,
that
the
question
you
pose
is
relevant
to
mr.
lydon,
i
think
that
a
well
advised
defense
attorney,
if
a
waiver
system
were
in
effect
at
the
time,
would
have
decided
to
go
to
the
second
tier
directly,
because
i
think
even
though
it
may
take
only
five
minutes
to
read
the
transcript,
your
honor,
one
thing
that
comes
across
from
the
transcript
is
that
the
defense
strategy
in
this
case
was
keyed
from
the
very
beginning
to
the
palpable
and
obvious
lack
of
any
proof
of
one
of
the
elements.
that
being
so,
and
that
being
the
defense
strategy,
it
would
not
be
well
advised
to
allow
the
state
to
have
two
opportunities
to
present
a
case,
because
the
state
would
have
an
opportunity
only
to
improve--
mr.
david
rossman
--i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
no,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
if
the
state
wants
to
adopt
a
procedure
that
allows
the
prosecutor
two
opportunities
to
convict,
it
has
got
to
tell
people
in
advance,
this
is
the
risk
you
run.
mr.
david
rossman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
david
rossman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
rossman
no,
they
don't,
your
honor.
using
the
word--
mr.
david
rossman
--the
word
has
historical
understanding,
your
honor,
and
its
custom
and
usage
in
massachusetts
indicates
that
when
you
appeal
for
a
trial
de
novo,
what
you
get
is
a
second
trial.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
course
that
massachusetts
has
chosen
to
adopt
in
response
to
the
double
jeopardy
problem
that
it
created
for
mr.
lydon,
in
other
words,
notifying
people
in
advance
so
that
they
have
fair
warning,
is
not
the
only
course
a
court
system
may
take
if
it
wants
to
continue
to
experiment
in
the
area
of
criminal
justice
and
have
a
de
novo
system.
pennsylvania,
for
example,
solves
the
problem
that
massachusetts
found
itself
in
with
mr.
lydon
by
allowing
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
on
insufficient
evidence
after
an
initial
trial
to
obtain
a
review
of
the
record
in
an
appellate
court,
through
a
common
law
writ
of
error.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
its
lydon
opinion
stated
that
if
it
were
wrong
about
the
application
of
burks
to
the
double
jeopardy...
excuse
me,
to
the
de
novo
system,
then
judges
in
the
second
tier
of
the
system
should
entertain
such
motions.
now,
if
a
state
chose
to
adopt,
or
as
pennsylvania
does,
continued
to
have
in
operation
that
type
of
a
system,
that,
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
would
also
answer
your
question
in
terms
of
federal
intervention
in
state
de
novo
systems,
because
one
could
expect
that
that
second
level
of
review
would
have
two
effects.
number
one,
that
second
level
of
review
would
have
the
effect
of
discovering
a
lot
of
these
mistakes,
as
indeed
the
mistake
was
discovered
in
mr.
lydon's
case,
where
the
prosecutor
conceded
the
evidence
was
insufficient
and
where
justice
wilkins
read
the
transcript,
and
whether
he
was
a
reviewing
court
or
was
not
a
reviewing
court,
he
at
least
wrote
an
opinion
where
he
stated,
i
do
not
report
my
ruling
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient,
so
that
one
would
expect
that
if
that
type
of
review
were
incorporated
into
a
de
novo
system,
very
few
cases
would
survive
and
get
to
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court.
a
second
consequence
of
that
type
of
review
would
be
to
tighten
up
the
procedure
for
evaluating
evidence
on
the
part
of
a
judge
and
the
preparation
and
presentation
of
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
in
the
first
tier
court.
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
can
only
have
the
effect
on
the
quality
of
justice
in
the
massachusetts
de
novo
system
of
improving
adherence
to
the
standards
of
due
process
by
both
judges
and
prosecutors
because
if
double
jeopardy
does
not
apply
to
the
first
tier
of
a
de
novo
system,
then
prosecutors
and
judges
lack
the
normal
incentive
that
prosecutors
and
judges
have
in
our
system
faithfully
to
adhere
to
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
if
the
court
credits
at
all
the
unanimous
opinion
of
commentators,
of
judges
from
massachusetts,
of
scholars,
going
back
to
1922,
when
felix
frankfurter
and
roscoe
pound
studied
the
lower
criminal
courts
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
that
the
quality
of
justice
in
these
courts
suffers
from
a
lack
of
adherence
to
the
standards
of
due
process,
i
submit
that
a
decision
telling
these
courts
that
double
jeopardy
did
not
apply
because
massachusetts
had
decided
never
to
look
at
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
would
be
a
decision
in
the
wrong
direction.
if
i
can
address
with
the
amount
of
time
i
have
remaining
the
question
of
the
appropriate
nature
of
federal
relief
here
granting
the
trial
which
will
violate
mr.
lydon's
constitutional
rights
has
not
yet
occurred,
i
submit
that
younger
versus
harris
considerations
do
apply,
and
i
also
submit,
your
honor,
that
younger
itself
expressly
recognizes
an
exception
for
cases
where
an
individual
establishes
there
will
be
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
because
that
establishes
that
there
will
be
an
irreparable
injury
to
his
constitutional
interests.
jeopardy
protects
an
individual
and
has
always
been
understood
to
protect
an
individual
from
having
to
undergo
a
trial
itself.
to
my
knowledge,
only
one
other
provision
of
the
constitution
provides
that
same
protection,
not
just
against
an
unconstitutional
conviction,
but
from
the
trial
itself,
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
which
hasn't
much
practical
implication.
where
an
individual
is
threatened
with
a
trial
that
will
violate
double
jeopardy,
unless
he
gets
relief
prior
to
the
trial,
that
much
of
the
constitution's
protection
will
be
irreparably
lost
if
he
has
to
wait
until
the
trial
is
over
to
get
relief,
and
younger
versus
harris
recognizes
that
pretrial
intervention
may
be
appropriate
where
an
individual
can
establish
irreparable
injury
plus
lack
of
an
adequate
remedy.
well,
massachusetts
has
already
said,
we
are
giving
you
no
remedy
because
we
think
there
is
no
violation.
since
we
wilfully
won't
look
at
the
predicate
for
determining
a
double
jeopardy
violation,
that
is,
we
will
never
look
at
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
therefore,
we
will
never
discover
a
double
jeopardy
violation.
since
we
won't
discover
one,
we
find--
mr.
david
rossman
--if
a
state
offered
an
individual
in
the
circumstance
you
mentioned
no
review,
that
factor
would
weigh
in
favor
of
federal
intervention.
that
wasn't
the
only
factor
the
first
circuit
relied
on.
it
also
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
commonwealth's
position
before
the
court
showed
no
need
for
a
speedy
retrial,
because
the
state
courts
had
granted
a
stay
of
at
least
eleven
months
and
never
asked
the
federal
court
to
allow
it
to
go
ahead
with
the
state
criminal
trial
pending
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
