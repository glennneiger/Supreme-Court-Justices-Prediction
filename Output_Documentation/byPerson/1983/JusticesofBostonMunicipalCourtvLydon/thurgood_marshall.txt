justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
true
that
the
prosecutor
conceded
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
no
way
for
any
court
to
pass
on
that,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
there
is
no
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
record
of
the
bench
trial
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
recording?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
here,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
smith,
if
massachusetts
had
put
on
this
first
hearing
instead
of
a
bench
trial
a
preliminary
hearing,
would
there
be
any
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
also
in
most
states
have
a
preliminary
hearing
which
you
can
have
or
you
can
waive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
this
one
they
can
have
or
they
can
waive.
justice
thurgood
marshall
both
are
before
a
judge.
if,
as
i
understand
it,
if
massachusetts
adopted
that
system,
this
point
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
if
you
called--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--if
you
just
changed
the
name
of
it,
and
called
it
a
preliminary
hearing
instead
of
a
bench
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
that
help
the
state
or
the
defendant?
or
does
it
confuse
both?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
witness
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
massachusetts
just
doesn't
want
to
change
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
it
positive
testimony
of
two
detectives
under
cross
examination
and
no
other
evidence?
both
of
them
claimed
to
be
eye
witnesses.
and
you
say
that
is
not
sufficient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--don't
you
agree
to
that
in
advance?
i
thought
the
defendant
agreed
to
that
in
advance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
agree
to
the
two-tier
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
didn't
agree
to
both
hearings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
the
lawyer
explain
it
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
his
lawyer
explain
burk
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
did
agree
to
the
two-tiered
system?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
have
read
the
whole
record
here
in
the
last
five
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
what
you
normally
would
call
a
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
the
state
has
got
to
adopt
its
procedure
to
the
defendant's
procedure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
the
state
would
have
to
adopt
its
procedure
depending
on
what
the
defendant
does.
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state's
language
is
that
the
second
hearing
is
an
"appeal".
not
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
correct,
and
so
does
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
say
the
same
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
consider
it
an
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
said
so.
