does
anything
in
the
proceedings
below
get
into
the
de
novo
trial?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
i
was
getting
at
is,
suppose
he
takes
the
stand
at
the
bench
trial,
and
then
he
takes
the
stand
at
the
de
novo
trial.
i
take
it
his
testimony
at
the
bench
trial
may
be
used
to
impeach
him.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
at
the
bench
trial
he
gets
six
months.
may
the...
and
then
he
is
convicted
by
the
jury
at
the
de
novo
trial.
may
he
get
two
and
a
half
years?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
where
would
that
appeal
take
place?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
here?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
ms.
smith,
let
me
go
back
a
little
bit.
in
response
to
the
inquiry
by
justice
marhsall,
judge
garrity
certainly
says
this
in
his
opinion.
"the
prosecution
conceded
and
the
single
justice
concluded
that
the
evidence
had
in
fact
been
insufficient
to
convict.
"
and
then
justice
wilkins
in
his
opinion
for
the
supreme
judicial
court,
it
seems
to
me,
phrased
that
a
little
differently.
he
said,
"accepting
the
defendant's
claim
that
the
evidence
at
the
bench
trial
did
not
warrant
third
convictions,
reserved
and
reported
two
questions
of
the
full
bench.
"
i
suppose
it
is
in
those
observations
that
the
case
centers,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
there
had
been
a
finding
by
the
court
sitting
as
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
we
would
never
reach
the--
unknown
speaker
--we
wouldn't
be
here,
but
what
about
the
concession
by
the
prosecutor?
is
that
recital
true?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
concession?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
be,
but
it
may
not
be,
but
it
would
still
leave
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
sufficient
event
such
as
a...
the
action
of
a
reviewing
court
in
order
to
trigger
the
operation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
other
state
or
commonwealth
that
has
this
single
justice
routine?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
your
position...
i
don't
quite
understand
about...
you
say
that
if
he
does
not
opt
for
a
de
novo
jury
trial,
but
is
convicted
in
the
bench
trial,
he
may
forego
the
jury
trial
and
go
right
into
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
that
is
why
i
wonder
why
you
answered
justice
stevens
the
way
you
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
certainly
don't
agree
with
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
i
don't
see...
what
is
your
position
in
this
other--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
additional
case,
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so
your
position
is
not
that
a
defendant
convicted
at
the
bench
trial
may,
without
availing
himself
of
a
de
novo
jury
trial
or
any
other
state
remedy,
he
may
not
go
directly
into
federal
habeas?
unknown
speaker
normally,
under
younger
and
harris
in
a
criminal
case
a
person
may
not
just
go
into
federal
habeas
after...
without
an
appeal.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
under
your
theory,
if
you
voluntary
take
the
two-tier
method,
and
you
are
acquitted
by
the
trial
judge,
you
go
free,
and
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
are
found
guilty,
you
cannot
have
a
second
trial
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
so
you
go
free.
my
third
question
is,
how
can
the
defendant
lose?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
evidence
at
the
bench
trial?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
talking
about
the
de
novo
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
used
it
to
get
rid
of
his
first
sentence.
unknown
speaker
he
used
it
to
get
rid
of
his
first
sentence.
unknown
speaker
it
would
follow
from
what
you
say,
mr.
rossman,
in
answer
to
my
previous
hypothetical
about
intervening
at
the
end
of
a
trial
which
has
come
in
with
a
mistrial,
a
federal
court
should
presumably
feel
perfectly
free
to
intervene
there
if
the
state
did
not
allow
any
appeal
of
a...
in
fact,
there
would
be
nothing
to
appeal
from,
because
the
case
would
simply
be
retried.
