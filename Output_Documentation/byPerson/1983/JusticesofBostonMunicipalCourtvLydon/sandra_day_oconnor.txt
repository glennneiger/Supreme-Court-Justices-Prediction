since
all
of
this
transpired,
does
massachusetts
now
ask
a
defendant
in
this
situation
to
expressly
waive
any
burks
right
that
might
exist?

mr.
rossman?
justice

if
mr.
lydon
had
expressly
waived
any
right
to
review
or
seek
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
the
first
trial,
would
that
have
been
binding
on
him,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
your
only
complaint
then
insufficient
notice
to
him
of
what
might
happen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
basically
your--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
i
asked
that
at
the
outset,
and
we
got
a
negative
answer.
maybe
i
misunderstood.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rossman,
suppose
the
waiver
system
were
already
in
place,
or
suppose
it
were
clear
that
there
had
been
a
waiver
of
any
burks
right
by
one
means
or
another.
do
you
suppose
there
are
defendants
who
would
nevertheless
opt
to
go
to
the
first
bench
trial
because
they
have
nothing
to
lose
by
previewing
the
state's
case,
so
to
speak?
