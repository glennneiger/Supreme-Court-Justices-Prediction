mr.
burt
neuborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
briefs
and
oral
argument
of
the
deputy
solicitor
general
illustrate
with
his
characteristic
clarity
the
narrowness
of
the
dispute
that
separates
the
demonstrators
and
the
park
service
in
this
case,
both
on
the
facts
and
the
law.
factually,
the
park
service
agrees
that
the
demonstrators
seeking
to
dramatize
the
plight
of
the
homeless
may
erect
symbolic
tents,
that
up
to
50
persons
in
a
quadrant
of
lafayette
park
and
up
to
100
persons
in
a
small
section
of
the
mall
may
maintain
a
24-hour
presence
in
and
about
the
tents,
and
may
assume
feigned
postures
of
sleep
in
connection
with
the
tents.
the
demonstrators
for
their
part
agree
and
recognize
that
they
may
be
there
for
seven
days,
not
three
months,
seven
days,
subject
to
a
renewable
permit
if
there
are
conflicting
uses
or
some
other
reason
why
they
should
not
stay.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
one
reason
why
they
could
cut
them
off
would
be
that
other
people
wanted
to
use
it.
but
if
there
were
also,
for
example,
a
danger
to
the
park,
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
grass
or
a
problem
with
maintenance
or
a
problem
with
the
usage,
for
example,
by
tourists.
if
indeed
the
general
use
of
the
park
were
jeopardized
by
remaining
beyond
the
seven
day
permit,
the
park
department
or
the
park
service--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--that's
an
issue
that
would
be
a
troublesome
one.
it's
not
this
case.
in
all
candor--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--in
all
candor,
your
honor,
justice
rehnquist,
the
position
of
the
demonstrators
at
that
point
would
be
that
the
government
would
be
obliged
to
demonstrate
a
reason,
some
justification
for
why
it
was
necessary
to
cut
the
demonstration
short.
if
in
fact
that
reason
were
present--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--i
would
rely
on
the
general
notions
of
the
first
amendment,
that
where
expressive
activity
is
at
stake
the
government
ought
to
demonstrate
some
need
before
it
cuts
it
off.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
property
of
the
government...
the
suggestion
that
the
parks
are
the
property
of
the
government
is
an
extraordinary
statement.
the
parks
are
the
property
of
the
people,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
burt
neuborne
title
to
the
parks
from
time
immemorial,
as
this
court
said
in
haig
versus
cio,
rests
in
the
people.
mr.
burt
neuborne
who
engage
in
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
burt
neuborne
if
that
were
factually
justified,
if
indeed
a
factual
basis
could
be
justified--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
facially
valid,
chief
justice
burger.
the
only
limitation
would
be
that
if
the
regulation
were
promulgated
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
first
amendment
activity
or
if
the
regulation
were
promulgated
in
the
absence
of
a
genuine
need
and
if
on
review
the
government
were
not
able
to
demonstrate
a
need,
then
the
regulation
would
be
subject
to
attack.
but
assuming
that
the
regulation
is
promulgated
in
good
faith
and
assuming
that
there
is
a
factual
basis
for
it,
yes,
a
security-based
regulation
would
be
valid.
no
one
suggest
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
take
risks
with
the
security
of
people
in
the
park
or
with
the
security
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
with
the
security
of
any
other
government
official.
if
indeed
a
factual
basis
is
laid
for
the
need
for
regulations,
the
regulations
are
valid.
indeed,
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about:
the
degree
to
which
the
government
is
obliged
to
justify
its
regulation
of
first
amendment
activity
by
coming
forward
and
demonstrating
a
factual
need
for
the
regulation.
there
is
no
question
but
that
these
demonstrators,
and
indeed
the
vast
bulk
of
people
engaged
in
first
amendment
activity,
would
not
wish
to
engage
in
activity
and
would
not
wish
to
urge
a
rule
that
would
create
a
genuine
risk
to
a
significant
social
interest.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
precise
numbers
for
this
demonstration
were,
as
i
understand
it,
20
tents
in
a
quadrant
of
lafayette
park
and
40
tents
on
the
mall.
the
numbers
of
the
tents,
of
course,
are
not
writ
in
stone.
if
the
park
service
felt
that
there
were
too
many
tents
and
that
were
the
problem,
of
course
one
could
discuss
the
degree
to
which
the
park
is
to
be
used.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
raises
the
troublesome
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions.
i
think
it
is
accurate
to
describe
those
decisions
as
not
having
reached
the
substantive
question
of
whether
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
erect
structures
in
a
park.
all
the
district
of
columbia
held,
and
i
take
it
the
reason
why
the
government
did
not
appeal
those
cases,
is
that
the
park
service
was
obliged
to
apply
a
nondiscriminatory
rule
with
respect
to
structures,
and
if
it
allowed
some
groups
to
erect
structures
then
it
had
to
allow
all
groups
to
erect
structures;
that
it
couldn't
pick
and
choose
on
the
basis
of
content.
and
since
the
parks
department
and
the
government
wishes
to
allow
certain
groups
to
continue
to
engage
in
that
type
of
activity,
they
were
obliged
to
apply
a
nondiscriminatory
rule.
there
is
no
case
that
i
know
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
requires
a
substantive
regulation.
it
is
an
equal
access
rule
that
is
applicable
in
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
if
that
issue--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
hope
not,
sir,
no.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
hope
not,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
so.
in
fact,
the
most
plausible
interest
the
government
has
put
forward
is
precisely
that.
they
have
suggested
that
if
the
homeless
demonstrators
are
permitted
to
sleep
as
part
of
expressing
their
message,
it
would
be
impossible
to
set
up
a
series
of
rules
that
will
distinguish
between
them
and
the
conventioneers
who
are
coming
to
town.
i
think
there
are
three
reasons
why
that
ad
horrendum
argument
doesn't
work.
the
first
one
is
just
the
general
notion
that
undifferentiated
fear
of
future
abuse
is
not
a
basis
for
suppressing
first
amendment
activity.
but
passing--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--undifferentiated
fear
of
future
abusive
attempts
to
use
the
parks.
there
is
no
empirical
basis
for
the
fear
that
large
numbers
of
people
wish
to
sleep
in
the
district
of
columbia
parks
in
the
dead
of
winter
to
express
a
point.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
for
one
thing,
there
are
camp
grounds
around
the
washington
area.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes.
but
if
it
was
their
purpose
to
camp,
then
the
camp
grounds
would
be
the
place
for
them.
if
it
was
their
purpose
to
express
a
message
really
at
the
center
of
the
nation's
consciousness...
and
i
commend
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--it
is,
your
honor.
but
the
nexus
between
the
demonstrators'
activities,
the
need
of
a
particular
group
to
have
a
form
of
expression...
the
only
form
of
expression
open
to
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
homeless
men,
is
to
attempt
to
re-enact
in
a
highly
public
place,
in
the
dead
of
winter,
in
a
dramatic
and
poignant
way
the
plight
of
what
it
means
to
be
homeless,
of
what
it
means
to
be
without
shelter
every
night.
the
close,
extremely
close
nexus
between
that
degree
of
message
and
the
concept
of
sleep
renders
that
group
very
different
than
other
people
who
would
come
into
the
park
and
say,
i
wish
to
sleep,
first
because
it's
convenient
for
me
to
do
so,
and
secondly
because
i
have
some
sham
reason
why
i
wish
to
express
an
idea
by
the
use
of
sleep.
no
one
suggests
that
the
park
service
would
be
obliged
to
ignore
the
good
faith
or
the
bona
fides
of
someone
who
came
and
argued
about
setting
up
a
tent.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i
hope
that
wouldn't
be
so.
if
it
were
so,
the
government
might
then
have
a
different
case,
if
in
fact
the
government
demonstrated
that
it
was
unable
to
administer
this
system.
after
all
the
federal
communications
commission
administers
a
very
troublesome
and
difficult
statute,
makes
sophisticated
choices
about
access
to
limited
resources,
does
so
in
a
non-content-based
way
by
making
judgments
about
the
good
faith
and
need
of
particular
demonstrators.
the
selective
service
system
makes
very
difficult
judgments
about
the
good
faith
of
persons
claiming
conscientious
objector
status.
unemployment
compensation
boards
across
the
united
states
determine
the
good
faith
of
religious
objections
in
cases
flowing
from
sherbert
versus
verner.
people
asserting
an
exemption
from
public
school
attendance,
from
a
whole
host
of
otherwise
applicable
and
valid
rules,
assert
religious
or
first
amendment
objections,
and
those
objections
are
passed
upon
for
sincerity.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
it
is,
and
it
is
an
attempt
to
reenact
a
particular
plight,
and
so
the
hypothetical
is
well
taken.
if
a
single
person
wished
to
do
that
a
single
time,
in
a
way
that
did
not
substantially
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
park...
i
would
assume
that
the
building
of
fires
and
the
breaking
of
earth
might
well
intrinsically
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
park
and
could
be
prohibited.
but
if
that
were
not
so
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
particular
enterprise
were
to
express
a
point,
well
then
i
think
they
probably
could
do
it.
the
problem,
the
problem
with
this
particular
case
and
the
point
that
the
government
so
aptly
makes
is
that
the
reason
that
this
is
important
to
the
demonstrators...
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
valid
question
for
both
the
court
to
ask
and
for
the
government
to
ask
is
that,
if
we're
willing
to
be
so
liberal,
if
the
government
is
willing
to
be
so
liberal
and
allow
the
24-hour
presence,
and
allow
the
tents,
and
allow
the
feigned
sleep,
why
is
it
that
the
demonstrators
feel
so
strongly
about
the
need
to
sleep?
why
isn't
feigned
sleep
enough?
and
i
think
that
goes
to
two
particular
questions,
two
particular
issues.
first,
the
question
of
what
it
is
the
demonstrators
are
attempting
to
express?
they're
attempting
to
express
the
central
fact
of
homelessness,
a
fact
which
is,
quite
frankly,
beyond
the
collective
consciousness
of
most
of
us...
the
notion
that
there
is
no
shelter,
no
shelter
at
all,
and
that
every
night
individuals,
human
beings
in
this
country,
go
without
decent
shelter;
and
that
the
central
fact
of
that
is
the
fact
that
they
must
find
a
place
to
sleep.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
the
distinction
is...
the
distinction
lies
at
two
points.
first
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
people
making
the
demonstration,
in
the
nature
of
the
people
involved
in
the
demonstration.
in
both
justice
powell's
hypothetical--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
in
that
case
the
question
might
well
be,
are
there
alternative
mechanisms
to
make
the
point,
and
how
closely
is
the
activity
connected
with
the
expression
that
the
demonstrators
are
attempting
to
carry
out?
here
you
have
a
group
of
people,
the
homeless
men,
who
lack
any
other
mechanism
for
getting
their
point
across.
in
fact...
and
forgive
me
for
stating
it
in
these
terms...
what
this
case
is
not
about,
and
what
unfortunately
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
appears
to
be
able
to
do
anything
about,
is
whether
or
not
homeless
people
will
sleep
in
the
parks.
homeless
people
will
be
in
lafayette
park,
they'll
be
on
the
mall,
they'll
be
in
the
parks
of
virtually
every
city
in
the
nation.
the
truth
is
we
are
prepared
to
tolerate
their
presence
sleeping
in
those
parks.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
would
assume,
justice
marshall,
very
few.
i
myself
have
not
been
there.
but
that
goes
back
to
the
reason
why
sleep
is
so
important
for
this
particular
demonstration.
the
purpose
of
the
demonstration
is
to
attempt
to
jolt
complacent
people
into
recognizing
what
it
means
to
be
homeless,
and
the
most
effective
way,
indeed
probably
the
only
effective
way,
since
all
of
us
have
excellent
defense
mechanisms
that
turn
homelessness
into
a
verbal
abstraction
and
that
keep
homeless
people
invisible,
the
only
effective
way
to
make
that
point
is
to
reenact
in
a
highly
public
place
at
the
center
of
the
nation's
consciousness...
and
that's
what
these
parks
are...
the
light
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
homeless
person.
and
the
notion
of
people
sleeping
in
the
midst
of
winter
without
adequate
shelter,
without
amenities,
without
food,
without
the
storage
of
belongings,
without
any
of
the
accoutrements
of
camping,
solely
to
make
that
point
is
the
significance
of
this
particular
demonstration.
and
the
reason
why
these
rules
are
so
important
and
the
reason
why
they
are
so
different
is
that
no
society
has
attempted
to
reach
out
to
the
disadvantaged
the
way
this
society
has,
to
provide
them
with
a
mechanism
for
entering
into
the
public
debate.
the
first
amendment,
were
it
confined
solely
to
verbal
activity,
were
it
confined
solely
to
the
classic
means
of
expression,
would
be
a
means
of
communication
that
was
open
to
the
comfortable
and
the
highly
educated.
and
what
is
extraordinary
about
our
law
and
what
allows
us
to
defend
it
against
criticisms
that
the
first
amendment
is
really
a
repressive
technique
is
that
this
court
in
two
lines
of
opinions
has
recognized
first
that
non-verbal
expressive
activity
is
worthy
of
first
amendment
protection,
and
secondly...
and
this
is
a
very
important
point,
justice
rehnquist,
in
answer
to
your
first
question...
that
the
free
public
spaces
of
the
nation,
the
parks
and
the
sidewalks,
are
legitimate
places
for
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
activity.
and
when
you
put
together
those
two
lines
of
cases,
the
notion
that
you
can
engage
in
non-verbal
expression
and
the
notion
that
you
can
do
so
in
the
free
public
spaces
of
the
nation,
you
have
put
together
a
mechanism
that
allows
every
segment
of
american
society
to
speak.
mr.
burt
neuborne
of
course.
mr.
burt
neuborne
absolutely
not.
i
think
that
there
is
an
imperative
of
shared
use,
and
i
think
if
the
government
comes
forward
with
legitimate
reasons
why
a
particular
area
or
a
particular
use
of
the
park
is
to
be
used
by
someone
else,
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
regulate
how
the
park
is
used
in
particular
settings.
this
particular
demonstration
is
scheduled
for
seven
days
in
the
midst
of
winter,
in
one
quadrant
of
lafayette
park
and
a
small
part
of
the
mall.
if
the
national
park
service
were
to
say
to
us
that
someone
else
wants
to
use
it
and
they
asked
for
it
first,
or
if
they
were
to
say
to
us
that
your
use
of
the
park
genuinely
interferes
with
other
people's
enjoyment,
i
think
we
would
not
persist
for
a
moment.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
there
are
areas
of
the
park,
for
example
the
areas
near
the
washington
monument,
the
area
surrounding
the
lincoln
memorial,
which
have
traditionally
been
recognized
as
places
of
serenity
and
contemplation.
and
were
the
park
service
to
designate
lafayette
park
as
such
an
area
of
serenity
and
contemplation,
i
think
it
would
be
a
serious
mistake,
because
that
has
come
to
be
a
traditional
place
of
the
exchange
of
ideas.
it
is
the
closest
thing
we
have
to
hyde
park
in
london.
but
were
the
park
service
to
do
that
and
were
there
to
be
sufficient
alternative
places
to
express
oneself,
i
would
have
no
objection
to
that.
i
hope
that
you
don't
believe
that
the
argument
here
is
an
argument
for
absolute
use
of
parks
whenever
a
first
amendment
person
wishes
to
do
so.
it
is
simply
this:
that
when
communicative
activity
is
to
take
place
in
a
park,
if
the
government
is
to
suppress
it
the
obligation
is
on
them
to
come
forward
with
a
reason,
with
a
genuine
need
to
do
so.
and
we
believe
on
the
facts
of
this
case
they
have
simply
failed
to
come
forward
with
their
reason.
there
might
be
other
cases,
but
not--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--were
there
a
showing
that
the
camping
out,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
sleeping
in
some
way
incrementally
interfered
with
the
park...
you
see,
the
problem
is
of
course,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
act
of
sleep,
the
act
of
actually
remaining
there,
which
is
quite
important
to
the
demonstrators
as
a
communicative
mechanism,
the
act
of
remaining
there
to
sleep
through
the
night
in
no
way
increases
the
intensity
of
the
park
use.
so
that
the
problem
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
government
simply
hasn't
made
its
showing.
there
may
be
other
cases.
there
may
be
other
situations
where
a
particular--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--well,
first,
justice
stevens,
we
have
agreed
and
i
think
the
government
recognizes
that
there
is
complete
agreement
on
the
maximum
number.
we're
talking
about
a
maximum
number
of
50
people.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
agree,
your
honor,
justice
stevens,
that
were
the
sleep
here
solely
facilitative,
were
it
simply
a
mechanism
to
make
it
easier
to
conduct
the
demonstration,
while
that
is
a
non-constitutional
factor
that
the
park
service
might
take
into
account,
it
is
certainly
not
constitutionally
obliged
to
do
so.
and
that
is
not
the
basis
on
which
we
argue
here.
mr.
burt
neuborne
but
there
is
a
linkage
between
that
statement
and
the
communicative
elements
as
well,
and
that
is
a
recognition...
and
this
is
a
biological
recognition...
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
homeless
person
and
on
the
street
all
day.
it
would
be
dishonest
for
us
to
represent
to
the
park
service
that
we
could
go
along
with
a
requirement
to
feign
sleep
and
have
homeless
people
at
the
demonstration,
because
as
a
biological
fact,
once
the
homeless
lie
down
they're
going
to
fall
asleep.
by
definition,
they
have
nowhere
else
to
go
to
take
a
catnap.
that
is,
that
is
one
of
the
principal
stumbling
blocks
in
accepting
what
is
a
generous
attempt
to
allow
first
amendment
activity
in
the
park,
and
that
is,
if
one
suggests
that
one
can
only
feign
sleep,
one
cannot
actually
sleep,
one
then
defines
homeless
people
out
of
the
demonstration,
because
it
is
simply
physically
impossible
for
a
homeless
person.
having
scuffled
on
the
streets
all
day
trying
to
get
food,
trying
to
get
a
place
to
satisfy
bodily
needs,
when
finally
that
homeless
person
comes
to
the
demonstration
site
and
lies
down,
that
homeless
person
is
going
to
fall
asleep.
and
it
would
be
dishonest
for
us
to
represent
to
the
park
service
that
anything
short
of
that
will
happen.
and
that
is
why
if
homeless
people
are
to
be
permitted
to
speak
in
this
demonstration,
that
the
sleep
must
be
permitted
or
else
the
demonstration
simply
cannot
take
place.
there
is,
and
this
is
of
course
quite
anticlimactic,
a
non-constitutional
way
to
review
this
case
as
well,
which
i
hope
the
court
will
consider.
it
is
i
think
consistent
with
appropriate
judicial
approaches
in
this
area,
and
that
is
to
look
closely
at
the
regulation
and
ascertain
whether
it
in
fact
bans
the
activity
that
the
demonstrators
hope
to
engage
in.
the
regulation,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
petitioners'
breach
at
appendix
1a,
the
regulation
forbids
using
the
park
as
a
living
accommodation,
and
it
sets
up
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
living
accommodation
is
in
fact
being
carried
out.
and
among
the
various
indicia
is
cooking,
breaking
the
earth,
storage
of
personal
belongings,
and
sleeping.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
yes,
we
did.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
they
did
not
address
the
issue.
but
i
hope
that
the
court
will
consider
whether
or
not
a
non-constitutional
means
of
resolving
this
issue
is
the
appropriate
one.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
but
i
think
the
traditional--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--no,
they
made
it
very
clear.
and
indeed,
in
all
fairness,
the
regulation
was
drafted
to
deal
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
i
think
where
there
are
two
plausible
constructions,
justice
white,
of
a
regulation...
and
i
think
it
is
a
plausible
construction
to
suggest
that
it
does
not
bar
the
activity
at
issue
here.
where
there
are
two
plausible
constructions,
one
of
which
would
avoid
a
difficult
constitutional
issue
and
one
of
which
would
force
the
court
to
confront
it,
if
there
is
a
plausible
construction
that
the
court
can
embrace
which
would
avoid
the
constitutional
issue--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
done
so
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
a
constitutional
adjudication.
to
summarize--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
they
don't
keep
warm,
mr.
justice
stevens.
that's
the
problem.
mr.
burt
neuborne
they
wrap
themselves,
they
wrap
themselves
in
whatever,
overcoats
and
bedding
and--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--oh,
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
is
no
amenity
whatever
contemplated
in
connection
with
this
demonstration.
what
will
take
place,
if
the
court
permits
it,
in
the
dead
of
winter
is
homeless
people
sleeping
in
tents,
wrapped
in
a
blanket,
wrapped
in
whatever
overcoats
they
have,
there
voluntarily
in
an
attempt
to
reach
out
and
touch
the
compassion
of
the
nation,
to
express
in
a
way
that
no
verbal
communication
can,
and
that
indeed
these
homeless
people
are
incapable
of
expressing
any
other
way
a
plea
for
help
and
a
plea
for
human
compassion.
that
the
case
raises
difficult
issues
is
unquestionable.
that
it
requires
the
drawing
of
difficult
lines
is--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
sir,
i
know.
mr.
burt
neuborne
they
would
be
and
indeed
are.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
there
are
pictures
taken.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that's
one
of
the
problems.
the
problem
is
getting--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--yes,
sir,
but
i--
mr.
burt
neuborne
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
problem,
justice
marshall,
is
that
they
don't
appear
to
see
them.
the
problem
is
that
when
the
homeless
people
are
isolated
and
alone
they
are
invisible,
and
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
mechanism
for
them
to
attain
some
expressive
conduct,
a
political
dimension
to
their
desperation.
and
short
of
assembling
them
in
a
public
place,
in
a
highly
public
area,
and
short
of
them
reenacting
the
central
plight
of
their
life,
there
appears
to
be
no
other
way
to
catch
the
heart
of
the
american
people,
and
that's
what
this
demonstration
is
all
about.
thank
you.
