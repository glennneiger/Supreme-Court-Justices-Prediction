mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
use
and
the
regulation
of
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
i
need
hardly
belabor
the
point,
therefore,
that
this
case
is
about
places
that
are
very,
very
special,
places
that
mean
something
to
every
american
and
that
really
do
belong
to
every
american.
they
are
places
that
are
intensely
used
for
all
kinds
of
activities.
they
are
very
grand
and
beautiful,
and
thousands
come
in
a
spirit
of
awe
and
reverence.
but
it's
also
the
case
that
thousands
come
just
to
jog
and
to
picnic
and
to
play
softball.
these
places
are
also
much
used,
and
fittingly
used,
for
political
demonstrations.
they
are
intensely
used
for
that
purpose.
the
park
service
statistics
indicate
that
somewhere
between
900
and
1,000
permits
are
sought
a
year
for
special
events
and
demonstrations
in
the
memorial
core
area.
so
that
on
any
given
day
there
will
be
an
average
of
three
or
so
demonstrations
going
on.
the
case
is
fundamentally
about
what
sorts
of
parks
these
are
to
be.
the
specific
question
in
the
case
is
whether
the
national
park
service
has
the
authority
to
enforce
a
flat
general
rule
that
provides
that
nobody
may
spend
the
night
camping
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
you
may
not
use
these
places
as
overnight
sleeping
accommodations.
respondents
are
here
arguing
that
the
constitution
gives
them
the
constitutional
right
to
use
these
places
as
overnight
sleeping
accommodations.
they
say
that
the
use
of
these
parks
overnight
for
sleep
is
speech
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
the
regulation
involved
in
the
case
is
not
in
terms
directed
at
speech.
it
does
not
on
its
face
even
have
the
effect
of
limiting
expression.
the
regulation
simply
prohibits
camping,
and
camping
is
defined
in
the
common
sense
way
of
use
of
the
parks
for
living
accommodation
purposes,
including
the
constituent
activity
of
sleeping
overnight
in
tents.
now,
respondents
asked
for
a
permit
to
conduct
a
demonstration
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
it's
common
ground
that
the
purpose
of
the
demonstration
was
sincere,
important
and
serious,
to
demonstrate
the
tragic
plight
of
homeless
people.
to
do
this,
the
respondents
sought
a
permit
to
erect
60
tents
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall,
and
there
would
be
150
people
demonstrating
there
for
a
period
of
three
months,
during
which
the
150
people
would
be
spending
the
nights
asleep
in
tents
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
the
park
service
granted
the
respondents
a
wide-ranging
permit
to
demonstrate.
nobody
tried
to
prevent
the
respondents
from
exercising
their
right
to
speak,
to
assemble,
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances.
respondents
were
told
they
could
come
to
lafayette
park,
they
could
speak
in
every
normal
sense
of
that
term
as
freely
as
they
wished,
they
could
maintain
a
continuous
round-the-clock
presence,
maintain
an
all-night
vigil.
they
could
assemble
and
parade
and
leaflet.
they
could
use
symbols
and
signs.
they
could
even
erect
symbolic
structures
and
tents
in
order
to
convey
the
message
of
homelessness.
but
they
were
also
told
that
they
may
not
use
the
park
overnight
to
sleep,
and
this
lawsuit
tests
the
validity
of
that
application
of
the
regulations.
the
government
is
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held
in
a
six
to
five
ruling
that
the
first
amendment
guarantee
of
freedom
of
speech
applies
to
the
sleeping
activity
proposed
by
the
demonstrators.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
district
court
found
explicitly,
on
the
basis
of
a
record
that
i
think
substantially
supports
that
finding,
that
there
has
been
no
discrimination
in
the
application
of
this
demonstration;
that
in
fact
the
park
service
has
across
the
board
tried
conscientiously
to
enforce
the
regulation
against
sleeping.
it
is
the
case
that
for
a
period
of
three
months,
under
a
previous
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia,
that
court
held
that
the
regulations
in
fact
permit
certain
kinds
of
sleeping.
the
government
then
proceeded
forthwith
to
amend
the
regulations.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
was
designed
to
prevent
camping
and
sleeping
as
a
constituent
of
that
camping.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
had
been
a
ban,
i
believe,
back...
i
don't
know
when
the
date--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--many
years
ago,
there
was
a
complete
rule
against
any
demonstration
in
lafayette
park.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
it's
not
this
case,
and
in
the
case
of
lafayette
park
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
it
would
be
valid,
but
we
luckily
do
not
need
to
argue
that
position.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
composition
of
the
park
service
regulations
on
that
is
to
maintain
a
bright
line
between
the
round-the-clock
vigil
and
the
camping,
sleeping
activity,
and
i
think
that
that
is
responsive
to
the
notion
that
the
round-the-clock
vigil
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
bright
line
is
between
the
round-the-clock--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
bright
line
is
between
two
sorts
of
activities.
i
think,
your
honor,
if
you
were
told...
if
i
were
told
that
i'm
allowed
to
go
into
that
park
and
maintain
a
round-the-clock
vigil,
but
i'm
not
allowed
to
use
the
park
as
sleeping
quarters
overnight,
i
think
i
would
understand
that
rule.
it
is
really
directed
at
two
different
sorts
of
activities.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
how?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
people
do
maintain
round-the-clock
vigils
in
these
parks.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
they
stand,
they
sing,
they
carry
candles.
there
are
many...
the
round-the-clock
vigil,
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
has
indicated,
is
a
fairly
well
recognized
and
understandable
and
important
sort
of
symbolic
activity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
why
that
line
is
in
fact
a
very
important
line.
the
problem
of
the
park
service
is
not...
that
is,
once
a
given
demonstrator
is
already
there
and
he's
allowed
to
go
into
the
tent
and
lie
down,
you
say,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
he's
actually
allowed
to
go
to
sleep?
but
that
does
not
mean,
your
honor,
that
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
parks
whether
the
rule
is
that
you
can
sleep
there
overnight
as
part
of
camping
activity
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
you're
allowed
to
stand
a
round-the-clock
vigil
and
if
you
want
in
connection
with
that
to
pretend
that
you
are
asleep.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
rule
bars
sleeping
only
if
it
is
a
constituent
of
the
use
of
the
park
for
living
accommodation
purposes.
that
is,
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
is
basically
to
prevent
the
kind
of
continuous
and
intense
use
that
is
associated
with
actually
coming
in
and
occupying
a
place
as
a
place
to
live
in.
and
we
think
that's
an
intelligible
line,
and
we
think
it
makes
a
difference,
justice
brennan,
because
the
fact
is
that
the
problem
of
feined
sleep
and
pretending
to
sleep
simply
has
not
surfaced
as
a
problem
in
the
management
of
these
parks.
the
problem
of
the
parks
is
to
try
to
save
them
from
the
kind
of
intense
occupation
that
is
associated
with
a
general
rule
that
you
can
come
in
and
camp
overnight.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
has
historically
been
the
position
of
the
park
service
that
these
places
simply
are
not
suited
for
camping
because
they
are
so
intensely
used
by
so
many
people
for
so
many
different
purposes.
so
that
that
problem
of
continuous
occupation
on
the
part
of
demonstrators
would
create
a
severe
strain
on
the
park
and
on
the
resources
of
the
services.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
right.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
it
is
not--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
finding
of
the
park
service
here,
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
is
that
the
threat
to
the
parks
comes
from
a
regime
in
which
people
generally
are
told
that
they
can
stay
for
a
long
time
and
sleep
there.
the
practice
of
people
catnapping
or
feigning--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
judgment
of
the
park
service
is
that
if
you
have
a
rule
that
you
have
to
maintain
an
all-night
vigil,
that
is
not
likely
to
threaten
the
park
in
a
serious
way.
that
is,
the
question
here
is
how
many
people
are
going
to
come,
how
long
are
they
going
to
stay.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
to
some
extent,
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
here
that
an
all-night
wakeful
vigil
is
an
important
first
amendment
activity.
similarly,
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
decisions
about
the
erection
of
these
symbolic
tents.
to
some
extent,
the
government
has
been
living
under
a
regime
of
cases
which
do
govern
us
quite
closely
and
quite
severely.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
not
cases
from
this
court.
in
fact,
the
only
case
from
this
court,
your
honor,
is
the
case
from
1972,
which
seemed
to
hold,
although
it
was
not
a
case
decided
on
the
basis
of
argument
and
briefing,
but
in
connection
with
a
stay
application,
but
that
did
install
an
injunction,
reinstall
an
injunction
which
prohibited
camping
overnight
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
that
was
the
morton
case,
decided
by
this
court
in
1972.
i
want
to
come
back
to
this
issue,
which
i
think
is
important
because
it
has
concerned
so
many
judges,
which
is
this
issue:
you've
allowed
them
so
much;
why
not
this
little
bit
extra?
we
think,
your
honors,
that
that
asks
the
question
from
the
wrong
perspective.
that
is,
retrospectively,
once
someone
is
there,
of
course
it
may
not
make
such
a
difference.
but
the
question
is,
what
system
of
rules
will
threaten
the
parks?
how
many
of
these
demonstrations
will
there
be
and
how
continuously
will
they
last?
that
is
why
we
think
it's
really
the
general
perspective
and
the
general
rule
which
says
it
does
not
endanger
the
parks
and
it
serves
important
first
amendment
purposes
to
allow
people
to
maintain
an
all-night
vigil,
an
around-the-clock
vigil,
because
that
can
serve
as
a
powerful
communicative
activity;
but
actually
going
in
those
tents
and
going
to
sleep
does
not
involve,
we
think,
powerful
communicative
activity
and,
if
allowed,
creates
a
general
regime
that
is
threatening
to
the
parks.
we
feel
that
one
of
the
most
fundamental
issues
in
this
case
is
sort
of
the
institutional
issue
of
whether
you
have
a
general
flat
rule
to
be
applied
across
the
board
to
all
comers
or
whether
you
have
to
really
do
a
case
by
case
review
in
each
case
whether
the
particular
proposal
to
sleep
in
the
park
has
an
important
communicative
or
first
amendment
aspect
and
therefore--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
believe,
your
honor,
that
there
are
no
cases
that
would
squarely
prevent
that.
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
examine
the
particular
circumstances.
but
our
position--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir,
right.
but
as
far
as
we
know,
we
would
not
be
in
conflict
in
any
direct
way
with
any
of
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
government,
we
believe,
has
tried
to
be,
to
take
a
position
that
does
treat
generously
of
the
business
of
demonstration.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
believe
we
have
gone
farther
than
the
constitution
requires.
i
believe
we
have
gone
beyond
the
minimum.
and
we
do
think
that
it
is
terribly
important
to
be
able
to
do
this
on
the
basis
of
flat
rules.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
you
would
have
to
have
a
permit
for
that.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
permits
would
not
allow
you
to
do
that
indefinitely.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
don't
believe
the
regulation
itself
contains
a
time
limit.
but
usually...
i
think
for
instance,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
a
seven-day
renewable
permit
was
given.
it
would
depend
very
much
on
whether
competing
applications
were
received.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir,
and
i
doubt
very
much
whether
all
60...
the
60
here
were
divided
between
lafayette
park
and
the
mall,
and
this
was
proposed
for
december
to
march,
so
that
the
specific
judgment
that
this
was
a
reasonable
demonstration
involved
that
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
your
honor,
the
government
does
feel
that
it
is
important
and
not
fundamentally
restrictive
of
the
first
amendment
to
say
that
one
thing
cannot
go
on
here
at
all
ever,
and
that's
to
move
in
and
sleep
overnight.
the
fact
is
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
indication
that
very
large
demonstrations
cannot
go
on
in
lafayette
park
and
particularly
the
mall
without
people
being
allowed
to
camp
there.
there
are
camp
grounds
around
washington.
it
is
the
case,
for
instance,
that
for
the
vietnam
veterans
demonstration
last
year
provisions
were
made
for
camping
out
in
greenbelt
park.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
the
history
of
the
city
that
you
absolutely
have
to
allow
people
to
camp
overnight
on
the
mall.
i
think
that
the
traditional
position
of
the
government
has
been
that
that
place
is
wholly
unsuited
for
camping.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
another
problem
with
the
contrary
view
here,
which
is
the
question,
if
you
ever
permit
it
when
do
you
permit
it?
one
of
the
very
important
concerns
of
the
government
here
is
that
if
this
regulation
can't
be
applied
on
an
across
the
board
basis
we
get
into
a
very
difficult,
case
by
case
review
of
the
question
whether
the
particular
demonstration
does
or
does
not
include
as
an
important
expressive
feature
the
business
of
sleeping
at
night
in
lafayette
park
and
the
mall.
and
we
believe
that
that
inevitably
turns
basically
into
content-oriented
licensing.
that
is,
if
you
adopt
the
rule
that
in
certain
cases
an
exception
has
to
be
made,
that
really
is
the
regime
that
the
respondents
ask
for
here.
they
agree
that
the
regulation
is
valid
on
its
face.
they
agree
that
usually
people
can
be
prevented
from
camping
on
the
park.
but
they
say
that
exceptions
must
be
made.
exceptions
for
whom?
well,
there's
the
rub.
they
say
exceptions
for
us,
for
other
people
similarly
situated.
but
in
all
the
history
of
this
case
nobody
has
been
able
to
come
up
with
an
understandable
rule
that
says
when
sleeping
in
the
park
is
or
is
not
an
important
speech
activity.
and
it
seems
quite
plain
to
the
government
that
therefore
what
this
comes
to
is
case
by
case
licensing
by
the
agency,
and
eventually
by
the
court.
and
it's
licensing
that
will
be
uncomfortably
content-oriented.
i
mean,
this
case
is
really
an
ironic
illustration,
your
honor,
of
the
fact.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
and
the
government
are
engaged
in
a
detailed
disputation
before
this
court
on
whether
sleeping
is
or
is
not
important
for
conveying
the
message
of
homelessness.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
that
would
be
a
perfectly
valid
regulation.
there
are
many
city
parks
of
that
size
and
that
uniqueness
that
are
in
fact
closed
at
night,
that
are
closed
at
dusk.
we
have
not,
the
government
has
not
adopted
that,
but
i
think
the
constitution
would
permit
it.
i
think
the
constitution
ought
to
give
the
government
some
latitude
in
regulating
these
parks,
as
long
as
the
rule
does
not
substantially
infringe
on
freedom
of
expression.
and
really,
your
honor,
i
guess
it's
important
that
i
come
back
and
remind
myself
and
remind
the
court:
this
regulation
does
not
substantially
narrow
the
range
of
expressive
activities
that
can
go
on.
it
does
not
seriously
prevent
the
demonstrators
here
from
conveying
their
message,
from
speaking.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
we
don't
think
the
physical
activity
of
sleeping
is
important
itself
in--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
marshall?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
understand
that,
justice
marshall,
and
we
respect--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
understand
that,
justice
marshall.
and
the
government
respects
and
i
respect
in
every
way
the
sincerity
and
the
importance
of
the
message
that
is
attempting
to
be
conveyed.
but
there
is
a
problem,
which
is
that
if
you
have
a
rule
not
to
curb
expression,
but
to
prevent
certain
kinds
of
conduct,
there
is
a
problem
about
saying
that
whenever
somebody
says
that
the
best
way
to
convey
a
message
is
to
act
it
out
by
engaging
in
that
conduct
that
that
automatically
constitutes
speech.
i
think
that
defacing
the
portrait
of
a
president
is
a
very
powerful
and
expressive
way
of
conveying
the
message
of
contempt
for
the
president.
is
it
speech
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment?
respondents
will
say
it's
a
silly
question
because
countervailing
governmental
interests
will
prevent,
will
justify
a
prohibition
of
destroying
presidential
portraits.
but
the
government
feels
it
has
the
right
to
persist
in
the
question:
when
you
prevent
destruction
of
the
presidential
portrait,
is
it
speech
that
is
being
suppressed?
there
is
a
problem
here
about
dissolving
the
distinction
between
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
speech
on
the
other,
that
i
think
that
this
court
was
sensitive
to
in
the
o'brien
case.
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
we
feel
that
saying
to
these
demonstrators,
you
can
come
to
lafayette
park,
you
can
stay
a
week,
you
can
take
turns
in
shifts,
you
can
speak,
you
can
petition,
you
can
leaflet,
you
can
parade,
you
can
hold
up
symbols
and
signs
as
much
as
you
want,
you
can
do
every
expressive
activity
short
of
actually
moving
in
and
living
here,
that
that
really
does
give
generous
scope
for
expressive
activity.
and
we
vigorously
say
that
the
government's
position
that
camping
is
not
allowed
in
these
parks
does
not
entail
a
callous
disregard
of
the
message
that
is
being
conveyed.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
your
honor.
i
just
keep
hoping
that
will
not
make
the
case
seem
trivial,
because
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
pretend
sleep
is
allowed,
which
is
not
a
problem
for
the
management
of
the
park,
is
really
somewhat
irrelevant
to
the
case.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
regulations
don't
say
people
may
pretend
to
sleep.
the
government
simply
has
not
dealt
with
this
problem
because
it's
a
non-problem.
what
the
regulations
say
is
that
you
may
demonstrate
and
in
connection
with
demonstrations
you
may
erect
symbolic
tents,
and
that's
what
we
were
told
we
had
to
do
in
one
of
the
court
of
appeals
cases.
and
really,
the
problem
of
people
then
coming
in
and
pretending
to
be
asleep
has
not...
the
government
has
created
a
program
for
that
activity.
it
just
is
a
non-problem.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
could
i
just
say
one
thing
to
that?
we
are
perhaps
stewing
in
our
own
juice,
but
we're
stewing
in
it
perhaps
because
i
think
it
has
been
the
position
here
of
the
government
to
try
to
be
as
receptive
as
possible
in
a
reasonable
way
to
what
are
important
first
amendment
activities.
somehow,
i
guess
we
feel
we're
being
cudgeled
on
account
of
that
and
that
we
shouldn't
be.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
demonstration
regulations
and
the
camping
regulations
do
not
speak
about
the
problem,
if
you
will,
of
people
sleeping
on
the
bench.
now,
there
are
probably
provisions
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
about--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--as
far
as
i
know.
i'm
a
little
uncertain,
but
none
of
the
regulations
that
we're
aware
of
speak
to
speech
as
such.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
sir.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
