unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
couple
of
preliminary
questions,
mr.
bator.
the
respondents
indicate
that
other
demonstrators
have
been
given
permits
by
the
park
service
to
sleep
overnight
in
the
park.
is
there
any
question
about
the
validity
of
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
and
the
amendment
of
the
regulations
was
designed
to
prevent
sleeping
overnight
in
the
parks?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
has
there
ever
been
a
complete
ban
on
demonstrating
in
lafayette
park?
unknown
speaker
many,
many
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
the
government's
position
that
that
would
be
perfectly
valid?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
sleeping
all
night
and
demonstrating
all
night?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
there's
a
bright
line
between
sleeping
and
not
sleeping?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
tell
when
somebody's
sleeping
and
when
they're
not
sleeping?
i
know
people
that
sleep
with
their
eyes
wide
open.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
was
worried
about
that
bright
line.
unknown
speaker
but
precisely
how
do
they
carry
on
the
round-the-clock
vigil
between
midnight
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
do
it?
unknown
speaker
how?
what
do
they
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
also
sit
in
a
chair
or
lie
down,
as
long
as
you're
not
sleeping,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can
enter
a
tent
and
lie
down
and
lie
there
all
night--
unknown
speaker
--as
long
as
you
don't
sleep?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
he
sleep
during
the
day?
does
the
rule
bar
him
from
sleeping
during
the
day?
unknown
speaker
is
that
partly
related
to
the
proposition
that
the
park
is
there
for
the
use
of
everyone,
including
hundreds
of
thousands
of
tourists
that
come
to
washington--
unknown
speaker
--want
to
take
pictures,
walk
around
the
flowers?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
i
have
trouble.
when
they
are
camping
there
and
not
sleeping,
aren't
they
interrupting
all
this,
other
people?
two
people
can't
be
in
the
same
spot
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
you
did
give
them
a
permit
to
set
up
tents
and
to
crawl
in
those
tents.
well,
that
deprives
these
people
from
walking
around
and
looking
at
the
flowers,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
agreed
to
that.
you
also
agreed
that
if
anybody
goes
to
sleep
on
a
bench,
you
don't
lock
him
up,
do
you,
for
sleeping?
unknown
speaker
if
he
just
happened
to
fall
off?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
bar
that.
they
said
you
can
stay
there
for
that
"long
time",
providing
you
don't
sleep.
isn't
that
what
the
rule
is?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
does
any
part
of
the
park
service's
liberality
in
the
regulations
accommodating
demonstrators
stem
from
previous
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia?
unknown
speaker
not
cases
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some...
are
there
any
cases
out
of
this
court...
perhaps
you've
answered
in
answering
justice
rehnquist,
but
are
there
any
cases
out
of
this
court
that
would
prevent
the
park
service
from
saying
that
no
tents
or
sleeping
materials
will
be
allowed
in
the
park?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
if
the
regulation
were
amended
to
provide
that,
that
you
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--judgments?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that,
since
you
say
that
the
question
is
being
asked
from
the
wrong
direction,
i
take
it
that
part
of
your
submission
is
that
you
could
prevent
any
sleeping
materials
in
the
park?
unknown
speaker
including
tents?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
farther
than
you
think
the
constitution
requires?
unknown
speaker
under
the
present
regulations,
could
a
person
put
up
a
tent,
let's
say
a
pup
tent
that's
probably
25
square
feet
more
or
less,
and
leave
it
there
for
an
indefinite
period,
under
the
existing
regulations?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
with
a
permit,
with
a
permit.
unknown
speaker
how
long?
is
there
a
time?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
50
pup
tents,
small
pup
tents
in
lafayette
park
for
seven
days,
especially
at
this
time
of
year,
would
you
say
that
would
interfere
with
use
of
the
park
by
other
people,
visitors,
tourists?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
general
rule,
assuming...
you
say
you
want
to
look
at
the
general
rule.
supposing
the
general
rule
would
prevent
demonstrations
such
as
the
veterans
march
of
many
years
ago
or
resurrection
city
or
some
massive
demonstration
in
the
city
of
washington
for
a
very,
very
important
cause.
and
it
couldn't...
that
kind
of
aggregation
of
people
couldn't
be
assembled
unless
they
allowed
some
kind
of
camping
or
sleeping
activity.
would
the
regulation
withstand
a
first
amendment
challenge
in
that
kind
of
situation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
demonstrations
of
the
kind
i've
described
could
really
be
prohibited?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
if
there
was
a
regulation
particularly
applying
to
lafayette
park
that
no
one,
no
one,
could
be
in
that
park
after
midnight
until
8:00
o'clock
in
the
morning?
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
it,
the
demonstrators
want
to
get
over
the
proposition
that
there
are
many
people
who
have
no
place
to
sleep.
now,
how
can
you
do
that
without
sleeping?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
tried
to
live
without
it?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
tried
to
live
without
sleeping?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
had
to
sleep
on
a
grating?
unknown
speaker
well,
these
people
want
you
and
others
to
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
look
out
the
window
of
your
office
and
you'll
see
it
every
night.
unknown
speaker
well,
indeed,
under
the
regulation
you
can
pretend
to
sleep.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
tends
to
seem
trivial,
i
think
the
government
has
nobody
but
itself
to
blame
for
having
gone
to
such
lengths
in
allowing
these
things.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
come
up
here
from
those
previous
judgments,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
stewing
in
your
own
juice
in
some
way.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
wanted
to
clarify
one
thing
i'm
not
sure
of.
is
there
a
regulation
that
prohibits
sleeping
unrelated
to
permits
and
so
forth?
so
that
if
some
of
these
people,
not
as
part
of
a
permitted
activity,
just
went
out
and
slept
on
a
bench
or
something,
could
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
no
park
district
regulations,
and
we're
talking
about
an
area
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
park
district?
unknown
speaker
i
wasn't
aware
of
any
either.
thank
you.
nothing
speaks
to
a
noontime
nap,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
if
they
did
not,
if
the
park
service
did
not
renew
after
seven
days,
must
they
have
the
burden
to
show
that
it's
because
other
people
want
to
use
it
or
can
they
just
cut
them
off
in
seven
days?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
just
decided,
seven
days
is
enough
for
any
one
demonstration?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
be
troublesome?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
case
would
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true
when
the
government's
dealing
with
its
own
property,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
do
you
think
title
to
the
parks
is
in,
mr.
neuborne?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
it
said--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
the
court
said
that
title
rested
in
the
people.
what
if
the
park
service,
in
conjunction
with
let's
say
the
secret
service
and
various
other
people,
said
that
for
security
reasons
all
areas
within
1,000
feet
or
however
many
feet
it
takes
to
get
up
to
the
hay-adams
and
the
width
of
lafayette
park,
that
that
would
be
closed
from
midnight
until
8:00
o'clock
in
the
morning?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
justified.
the
justification
is
just
what
i
postulated,
that
for
for
security
reasons
the
park
must
be
cleared
by
midnight
and
no
person
is
allowed
in
until
8:00
o'clock
in
the
morning.
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
say
is
the
number
of
tents
that
could
be
put
up
in
lafayette
park?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
regulation
that
no
tents,
no
tents
at
all,
would
be
allowed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
neuborne--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
put
a
hypothetical.
let's
assume
a
small
group
wanted
to
hold
a
convention
in
washington
and
they
decided
that
the
hotel
rates
here
were
too
high
and
so
they
applied
for
a
permit
to
bring
their
tents
and
sleeping
bags
and
stay
in
lafayette
park
for
the
duration
of
the
convention.
that
i
take
it
would
be,
if
you
win
this
case,
would
be
a
permit
the
government
would
have
to
grant?
unknown
speaker
sir?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
particular
convention
was
composed
of
people
of
very
limited
or
negligible
means,
wouldn't
they
have
similar
objectives
to
your
clients,
that
they
just
couldn't
afford
any
of
the
hotels
in
washington?
unknown
speaker
your
people
could
have
gone
there
also,
couldn't
they?
unknown
speaker
a
message
that
hotel
rates
are
too
high
is
not
a
first
amendment
expression?
unknown
speaker
you
underestimate
the
resourcefulness
of
lawyers.
i
should
think
a
good
many
suits
would
be
brought
in
light
of
what
you
just
said.
unknown
speaker
are
the
campers
here
allowed
to
have
a
fire?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
group
came,
to
extend
justice
powell's
illustration,
and
said
that
they
noticed
that
the
washington
post
had
within
the
last
week
announced
or
indicated
that
prices
of
restaurants
were
prohibitive
in
washington,
too
high,
and
that
they
then
want
to
assert
their
view
in
opposition
to
and
to
demonstrate
the
plight
of
ordinary
people
who
can't
afford
to
pay
$25
or
$30
for
dinner
or
$7
for
a
breakfast,
and
so
they
want
to
have
a
fire
to
cook
their
own
breakfast
and
lunch?
unknown
speaker
that's
demonstrating
a
point,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
for
first
amendment
analysis,
is
that
any
different
from
camping
in
the
park,
in
justice
powell's
illustration,
as
a
protest
against
the
high
rates
of
hotels,
and
having
fires
to
cook
meals
to
protest
against
the
high
cost
of
restaurants
in
washington?
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
distinguishable?
unknown
speaker
my
hypothesis,
you
must
accept
it
assuming
that
the
people
who
are
doing
what
i
suggest
are
just
as
sincere
and
just
as
hard-pressed
as
your
people
are.
what
is
the
difference
for
first
amendment
analysis?
unknown
speaker
approximately
how
many
people
pass
by
the
mall
between
the
hours
of
12:00
midnight
and
6:00
in
the
morning?
unknown
speaker
will
you
stop
a
minute
so
i
can
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
good.
if
the
parks
are
scheduled
for
other
activities...
softball
games,
soccer
games,
that
sort
of
thing...
do
you
think
that
the
first
amendment
claims
can
simply
override
those
activities?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
government
were
to
say
that
lafayette
park
is
a
very
small
place
and
as
a
result
we're
not
going
to
allow
any
demonstrations.
it
interferes
with
too
many
tourists.
they
like
to
see
the
park
just
as
kind
of
like
a
green
pleasant
place.
they
don't
like
the
hassle
of
demonstrations.
if
you
want
to
demonstrate,
you
can
go
to
the
mall,
where
you're
equally
visible,
and
we're
just
not
going
to
have
lafayette
park
used
for
demonstrations.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
really
so
unreasonable,
though,
to
say
that
in
a
tiny
fragile
park
like
lafayette
park
that
you
can't
camp
out?
you
can
do
all
these
other
things,
but
you
can't
camp
out.
is
that
really
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
mr.
neuborne,
i
wonder
if
that's
consistent
with
the
record.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
ways
to
look
at
this
case.
one
is
that
the
only
thing
that's
at
stake
is
whether
they
lie
there
and
pretend
they're
asleep
or
actually
sleep,
and
you
have
roughly
the
same
number
of
people
as
otherwise.
or
alternatively...
and
this
is
what
i
understand
the
facts
to
be...
it
may
be
that
unless
they're
allowed
to
sleep
they
really
won't
come,
a
significant
number
of
people
will
not
be
there.
and
that's
what
your
application
said.
so
the
difference
as
i
understand
it
is
not
just
this
hairline
between
feigned
sleeping
and
real
sleeping.
it's
the
difference
between
what
the
government
would
call
camping
and
you
would
call
demonstrating
and
just
not
having
it,
having
no
such
activity.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
your
own
application
says
that
the
maximum
number
will
never
be
there
unless
they
can
sleep.
so
that
you
can
really
look
at
the
case
as
the
sleeping
is
a
function
that
must
be
performed
in
order
to
let
the
demonstration
be
successful,
sort
of
like
saying
you've
got
to
be
able
to
camp
somewhere
if
you're
going
to
have
a
resurrection
city...
a
functional
need
in
order
to
have
an
overall
demonstration,
which
is
quite
different
from
the
thing
you've
both
been
arguing
about,
namely
that
you're
assuming
everybody's
out
there
pretending
their
asleep
when
we
know
that's
not
true;
they
are
not
going
to
be
there
unless
they
can
sleep.
unknown
speaker
i
realize
it's
not
the
basis
on
which
you
argue,
but
it's
what
you
said
in
your
application.
unknown
speaker
did
you
present
this
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
did
any
of
the
eleven
judges
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
question
that
what
the
people
who
drafted
it
interpret
the
regulation
that
way.
unknown
speaker
and
there's
no
mystery
about
what
their
interpretation
is.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
the
regulation
subject
to
that
construction?
it
might
be
subject
to
some
other
construction,
but
isn't
it--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
override
the
view
of
the
agency
of
its
own
regulation?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
factual
question.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
fires
permitted.
how
do
these
people
keep
warm?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they
come--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
don't
have
anything
like
electric
heaters--
unknown
speaker
--or
anything
like
that,
or
blankets?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
take
a
picture
of
them
sleeping
on
the
gratings,
which
they
do
all
over
washington?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
take
those
and
use
those?
wouldn't
they
be
a
demonstration?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
are
they
used?
where
do
you
ever
see
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
how
are
you
going
to...
i'll
bet
you
more
people
pass
by
the
department
of
justice
building
than
pass
by
the
mall.
unknown
speaker
and
they
can
see
them
sitting
on
the
grating
in
front
of
the
department
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
they
have
to
go
over
to
the
mall
to
see
them?
