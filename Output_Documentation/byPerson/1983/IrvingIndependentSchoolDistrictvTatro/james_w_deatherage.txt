mr.
james
w.
deatherage
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit.
the
battle
lines
were
drawn
in
this
case
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act
requires
public
schools
to
provide
and
perform
medical
treatment
prescribed
by
a
private
physician
and
delegated
to
the
school
as
a
related
service
in
order
for
the
child
to
benefit
from
education,
special
education,
and
to
receive
a
free,
appropriate
public
education.
initially,
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here,
filed
an
application
for
preliminary
injunction
seeking
an
order
from
the
district
court
ordering
the
district,
the
irving
independent
school
district,
to
provide
a
medical
procedure
subsequently
stipulated
and
found
to
be
medical
treatment
to
the
respondent,
amber
tatro.
the
school
district
denied
the
application...
i'm
sorry...
the
district
court
denied
the
preliminary
application
for
injunction
relief
and
held
that
the
medical
treatment
requested
did
not
arise
from
the
effort
to
educate,
and
that
section
504
of
the
1973
rehabilitation
act
could
not
be
converted
into
a
statute
requiring
the
setting
up
of
governmental
health
care.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
justice
o'connor,
the
record
reflects
there
is
no
question
at
all.
ultimately,
the
plaintiffs
stipulated...
or
the
respondents
stipulated
in
the
pretrial
order
found
in
the
joint
appendix
that
clean
intermittent
catherization,
the
procedure
in
question,
was
medical
treatment.
their
physician...
dr.
george
hurt,
who
was
one
of
the
co-authors
of
the
document
ultimately
adopted
by
the
american
medical
association...
testified
it
was
the
medical
treatment
of
choice
of
a
disease
state
suffered
by
amber;
that
is,
an
urgent
bladder.
so
there's
never
been
a
question
or
a
dispute,
at
least
since
the
administrative
hearing,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
procedure
is
medical
treatment.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
under
texas
law,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
is
construed
as
medical
treatment
by
the
school
employee
who
gives
the
medication.
it
is
medical
treatment
when
the
doctor
prescribes
it
so
that
the
parent
or
the
child
can
go
to
the
pharmacy
and
obtain
the
medication.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
whether
or
not
it
has
to
be
administered
personally
by
the
physician
does
not
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
medical
treatment
as
defined
under
the
texas
medical
practice
act.
under
that
act
as
amended
since
trial
of
this
case,
the
physician...
and
at
the
time
of
trial...
the
physician
may,
in
accordance
with
the
act
and
the
board
of
medical
examiners
rule,
prescribe
certain
medical
tasks
and
delegate
them
to
another
party,
a
third
party
other
than
the
patient,
for
performance,
such
as
a
scrub
nurse
in
surgery,
so
long
as
that
physician
retains
supervision
and
control
of
the
delegatee
and
the
act
to
be
performed;
but
it
is
still
medical
treatment.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
prescribing
it
by
the
physician
is.
there
is
a
specific
statute...
even
if
we
construe
it
as
being
medical
treatment,
if
the
school
teacher
gives
what
the
parent
had
brought,
the
pill,
in
a
container...
there
is
a
texas
statute
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
that
specifically
authorizes
the
public
school
employee
under
certain
conditions,
if
the
parent
sends
the
medication
in
its
original
container,
that
allows
the
schoolteacher
to
give
that
child
that
pill
and
be
immune
from
civil
liability
for
damages
if
something
adverse
happens.
there
is
no
similar
statute
in
texas
that
is
applicable
to
this
type
of
procedure
involved
in
this
case.
the
district
court
initially,
as
i
related
earlier,
held
that
the
requested
medical
treatment
did
not
arise
from
the
effort
to
educate
and
that
it
could
not
be
converted
into
a
statute
requiring
the
setting
up
of
governmental
health
care
under
section
504.
the
fifth
circuit
panel
initially
in
tatro
i
held
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
on
both
counts
and
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
what
we
believe...
we
believe
to
be
an
advisory
opinion,
since
the
court
acknowledged
initially
it
had
no
facts
before
it.
on
remand,
the
district
court,
feeling
constrained
by
tatro
i,
found
that
the
petitioner,
the
school
district,
could
not
lawfully
provide
the
medical
treatment
under
texas
law
without
additional
services
of
a
licensed
physician;
that
under--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that,
justice
blackmun.
she
may
be.
i
know
it
was
one
of
the...
it
has
been
and
always
has
been
one
of
the
goals
for
amber
through
occupational
therapy
and
other
specialized
instruction
to...
where
she
can
ultimately
do
that.
whether
or
not
friday
at
school
she
was
able
to
take
care
of
herself,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
under
texas
law,
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
believe
so.
there
is
a
distinction.
when
the
doctor
writes
a
prescription
for
medication,
he
writes
the
prescription
directed
to
the
pharmacist
to
fill
this
prescription.
he
does
not
direct
that
prescription
to
the
public
school
employee
and
does
not
delegate
to
the
public
school
employee
the
administering
of
that
pill.
that's
dedicated
to
the...
the
prescription
is
written
to
the
pharmacy.
the
parent
may
choose
to
bring
the
medicine
in
its
original
container,
under
the
state
statute,
and
in
writing
authorize
the
school
employee
to
give
out
of
that
original
container
that
medication
in
accordance
with
the
label
on...
on
the
container.
but
in
that
instance,
you
see,
the
employee
of
the
school
is
making
no
judgments,
forming
no
judgments,
is
not
exercising
any
medical
judgment
in
merely
removing
the
capsule
and
giving
it
to
the
student
with
the
consent
of
the
parent,
because
the
prescription
is
not
directed
to
the
school
employee.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
the
public
school
employee
at
that
time
was
subjected
individually
to
claims
for
damages--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--that
was...
yes.
they've
done
it
for
years.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
no,
justice
stevens,
there's
not.
under
the
texas
medical
practice
act,
the
district
court
found
a
physician
may
prescribe
medical
treatment
and
delegate
its
performance
to
a
nonlicensed
person
or
institution
that
he
deems
qualified
subject
to
control,
supervision
and
adequate
monitoring
by
the
physician;
that
the
physician
may
prescribe
the
medical
treatment
to
be
furnished
by
the
public
school
if
he
believes
the
school
has
personnel
qualified
to
perform
it.
the
school
employee
was
found...
or
the
school
was
found
to
employ
professional
nurses
that
with
sufficient
training,
the
court
found,
the
school's
nurses
are
capable
of
performing
the
medical
treatment,
and
that
when
the
medical
treatment
is
performed
by
such
nurses
in
accordance
with
a
valid
doctor's
prescription,
it
would
not
constitute
the
unlawful
practice
of
medicine.
until
that
occurs,
the
court
had
found,
relying
on
an
amicus
brief
of
the
texas
medical
association
attached
to
its
memorandum
opinion...
opinions,
that
if
the
school
had
provided
catheterization
without
a
doctor's
prescription
valid
under
texas
law,
it
would
have
unlawfully
been
practicing
medicine.
also,
the
court
found
that
if
these
conditions
are
met,
the
medical
treatment
then
becomes
services
provided
by
a
qualified
school
nurse
or
other
qualified
person,
which
is
the
definition
of
school
health
services
under
the
regulations
implementing
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act.
therefore,
these
are
school
health
services
and
are
therefore
related
services
because
also
under
the
regulation
they
define
related
services
to
include
school
health
services,
and
that's
not
mentioned
in
the
statute.
the
district
court,
based
on
these
findings,
ordered
the
petitioner
to:
one,
secure
the
services
of
sufficiently
trained
persons
to
allow
a
trained
doctor
to
prescribe
medical
treatment
to
be
furnished
by
the
school,
and
to
modify
amber
tatro's
individualized
education
plan
to
provide
for
the
medical
treatment
as
prescribed
by
her
personal
physician.
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--the
state
and
the
irving
independent
school
district
must
provide
amber
tatro
with
a
free,
appropriate
public
education
as
that's
defined
in
the
statute,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
rowley;
and
that
may
include
all
gamut
of
specialized
instruction.
it
can
include
instruction
in
a
regular
classroom.
it
may
include
resource
room
instruction.
it
may
include
itinerant
instruction.
whatever
the
committee
of
professional
school
employees,
with
sufficient
parental
involvement,
can
reach
as
being
an
appropriate
plan
to
meet
amber's
individualized
educational
needs
is
their
duty,
at
least
to
the
basic
floor
of
opportunity
this
court
articulated
in
rowley.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
in
relation
to
the
cost
of
a
person
to
insert
and
withdraw
the
catheter
two
times
a
day,
and
if
that's
the
only
cost,
the
catheterization,
certainly
it
probably
will.
but
that
is
their
obligation
under
the
act.
the
fifth
circuit
on
second
appeal,
feeling
constrained
by
tatro
i,
affirmed,
which
brings
us
to
this
court.
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act
was
enacted
by
congress
to
assist
the
states
in
their
efforts
to
educate
handicapped
children.
it
was
enacted
to
encourage
the
states
to
provide
more
and
better
programs
for
handicapped
students.
it
mandates
that
the
recipient
of
the
funds
provide
handicapped
children
such
as
amber
a
free,
appropriate
public
education
and
an
individualized
education
plan
which
is
to
include
specialized
instruction
to
meet
her
unique
needs.
the
statutory
provision
in
question
here
is
found
in
section
1401(17)
of
the
act.
it
defines
related
services
to
mean
in
pertinent
part
transportation
and
such
developmental,
corrective
and
supportive
services,
including
medical
services,
as
may
be
required
to
assist
the
handicapped
child
to
benefit
from
special
education.
but
there
is
a
limitation
placed
by
congress
in
its
definition
as
it
relates
to
medical
services,
and
it
limits
medical
services
to
diagnosis
and
evaluation
only.
the
implementing
regulations
define
medical
services
to
mean
services
of
a
licensed
physician
for
diagnosis,
evaluation
of
a
handicapping
condition
only.
the
question
then
becomes...
has
become
in
the
lower
courts
whether
or
not
clean
intermittent
catheterization,
stipulated
to
be
medical
treatment,
found
by
the
court
to
be
such,
is
a
school
health
service...
that
is,
services
of
a
qualified...
of
a
school
nurse
or
a
qualified
person...
or
medical
service.
finding
that
it
fits
under
either
classification
doesn't
answer
the
question.
the
question
is
did
congress
intend
that
the
nature
and
purpose
of
a
particular
procedure
that
is
medical
treatment
be
provided
by
the
states
and
by
the
local
educational
agencies.
and
we
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
act,
its
legislative
history
or
its
stated
purpose
to
reach
that
conclusion.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
at
least...
yes,
i
think...
i
think
you
must...
i
think
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
look,
and
all
the
courts
in
this
area,
to
some
degree
to
state
law
in
determining
perhaps
what
is
medical
treatment.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
i
submit
that
is
answered
by
looking
to
the
state
plan
that
is
agreed
to
by
the
state
and
the
secretary
under
the
act,
that's
called
for
for
the
act,
in
order
for
the
state
to
get
those...
to
get
the
federal
funds;
that
the
content
of
a
state
plan
will
address
what
the
state
provides
as
medical
services,
school
health
services,
which
is
then
agreed
to
by
the
secretary.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
think--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--i
think
it
does.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
that's
included
in
the
cites
of
part
of
the
implementing
regulations.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
see
how
that
could
apply,
because
the
state
is
the
one
that
enters
into
the
contract
with
the
federal
government,
and
a
part
of
that
state
contract
is
they
require
the
local
school
district
to...
applying
for
funds
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
a
state
plan.
so
i...
i
don't
believe...
i
can't
envision
a
situation
or
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
one
school
district
is
not
required
to
provide
certain
services
and
another
school
district
is
within
the
same
state.
thank
you.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
answer
one
issue
or,
as
counsel
says,
the
only
issue,
and
that
is
access.
if
i
read
this
court's
opinion
in
rowley
and
if
i
read
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act,
it
is...
i
don't
find
any...
anything...
any
authority
to
say
that
it's
to
guarantee
access
to
any
particular,
specific
class,
program
or
activity.
but
as
i
believe
this
court
said
in
rowley,
it
is
access
to
special
education
and
to
an
appropriate
public
education.
the
underlying
theory
or
philosophy
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act,
in
addition
to
its
purpose
of
providing
for
early
identification,
proper
evaluation
and
appropriate
placement,
is
the
individualization
of
an
education
plan
for
a
child.
and
as
rowley
again
said,
i
believe
in
footnote
4
of
that
opinion,
congress
recognized
that
not
all
children
are
going
to
be
able
to
be
safely
educated
in
what
is
referred
to
as
the
least
restrictive
environment.
it
recognizes
the
health
and
safety
conditions
of
a
child.
so
to
characterize
the
issue
in
this
case
as
access
to
a
particular
classroom
is
to
disregard
a
record
made
in
this
case
since
june
of
1979
which
has
been
always,
until
counsel's
brief,
whether
or
not
medical
treatment
required
to
be
prescribed
by
a
private
physician
is
mandated
by
congress
to
be
provided
as
a
related
service
by
the
public
schools.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
may
be,
depending
on
the
doctor's
purpose
in
the
prescription
and
to
the
degree
whether
it's
related
to
benefitting
from
special
education.
but
to
merely
prescribe
a
particular
physical
therapy
may
or
may
not
in
a
given
case
fall
within
the
requirements
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
further,
the
recitation
of
physical
therapy
in
the
statute
doesn't
have
the
limiting
language
volume
as
medical
services
does,
which
says
except
for
diagnosis
and
evaluation
only.
as
to
what
other
courts
deal
with
the
extent
or
parameters
of
physical
therapy,
i
would
not
represent
to
this
court
today.
but
certainly,
there
would
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
exceptions,
and
there
are
in
the
state
plan.
another
issue
or
a
matter
to
keep...
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
remembering
what
qualified
amber
for
special
education
under
the
act
in
the
first
place.
that
was
an
orthopedic
impairment.
that
is
what
entitled
her
to
special
education.
the
medical
treatment
prescribed
by
the
doctor
in
this
case
is
for
treatment
of
a
condition
completely
unrelated
to
what
qualifies
her
for
special
education.
and
there's
never
been
a
dispute
in
that
in
this
case,
and
in
fact,
that
has
been
stipulated
to
as
to
the
orthopedic
impairment,
and
that
the
neurogenic
bladder
to
which
this
case
is
designed
is
not
related
to
that.
under
the
court's
reasoning
below,
whatever--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
saying
it
cannot
qualify.
i
only
say
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
only
the
orthopedic
impairment
with
some
speech
impairment
is
what
qualified.
in
another
case
it
very
well
could,
in
a
more
severe
case.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
developmental
delays
in
gross
and
fine
motor
skills,
which
is
why
the
physical
therapy
was
designed
for
the
improvement
of
gross
motor
skills,
so
the
child
can
benefit
from
special
education,
can
participate
in
physical
activities,
i.e.,
physical
education
classes
offered
by
the
school
district;
occupational
therapy
designed
to
develop
and
improve
fine
motor
skills
in
which
amber
was
developmentally
delayed,
so
she
can
grasp
a
pencil
to
write,
so
some
day
she
can
learn
to
grasp
a
catheter
and
take
care
of
her
own
self.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
correct,
justice
blackmun.
and
my
point
is
that
the
urology
problem
is
not
what
qualifies
her
for
special
education,
but
is
what
the
respondent
seeks
the
medical
treatment
for.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
justice
white,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
as
i
said
in
my
opening
argument,
the
history
of
this
case
has
been
a
battle
as
between
whether
this
is
a
medical
service
or
whether
it
is
a
school
health
service.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
medical
treatment
is
required.
it's
not
who
may
be
qualified
to
perform
it
under
either
the
federal
act
or
the
state
act.
it
is
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
treatment.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
if
the
fact
situation
in
another
case
were
different,
justice
white--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--in
this
case
i
cannot
concede
that,
because
the
district
court
found
that
the
school
could
not
lawfully
provide
this
treatment
without
a
doctor's
prescription.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
facts
and
did
not
have
the
facts
that
this
court
has
before
it
now.
it
had
no
record.
but
in
that
regard,
justice
goldberg
in
the
tatro
i
opinion
in
his
three-pronged
test
in
dealing
whether
a
life
support
system
is
a
related
service,
said
that
excluded
from
the
term
"related
services"
are
those
health-related
activities
which
must
be
performed
by
a
licensed
physician
that
are
not
provided
to
determine
a
child's
medically
related
handicapping
condition
which
results
in
the
child's
need
for
special
education.
by
looking
at
texas
medical
association
brief
requested
by
the
trial
court,
made
a
part
of
its
memorandum
opinion,
page
25
and
6
of
our
brief
are
listed
numerous
services
of
a
licensed
physician
that
are
required
in
this
case
in
order
for
the
school
district
to
provide
what
is
prescribed.
and
we
have
listed
some
seven
or
eight
texas
medical
association--
so
by...
under
the
fifth
circuit's
own
reasoning
and
its
exclusion,
in
this
case
this
medical
record
falls
within
that
exclusion,
because
it
requires
the
services
of
a
licensed
physician.
under
the
reasoning
of
this...
of
this
case
and
of
the
courts
below,
whether
the
treatment
prescribed
by
the
doctor
is
simple
or
complex,
whether
it
is
costly
or
cheap,
will
have
to
be
provided
by
the
public
school,
whether
that
treatment
might
be
sterile
catheterization,
which
prior
to
cic
was
considered
the
treatment
of
choice.
if
a
doctor,
who
may
not
be
knowledgeable
of
the
current
standard
of
practice,
prescribes
sterile
catheterization
or
another
procedure
to
empty
the
bladder
called
purveying
the
bladder,
and
delegates
that
treatment
to
the
school,
under
the
reasoning
of
the
courts
below,
the
school
will
have
to
provide
it
or
will
have
to
challenge
that
prescribing
physician
over
his
standard
of
medical
practice.
they'll
either
have
to
do
it
or
be
subjected
to
having
knowledge
it's
not
the
current
treatment
of
choice
and
yet
going
on
and
doing
what
the
doctor
prescribed.
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
am
i
comfortable
or--
mr.
james
w.
deatherage
--justice
white,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
disagree
with
the
interpretation
of
texas
law.
the
district
court
looked
to
the
texas
medical
practices
act
to
answer
the
question.
our
position
is
it
should
have
looked
to
the
state
plan
approved
by
the
secretary
to
answer
the
question.
