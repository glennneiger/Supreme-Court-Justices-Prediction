unknown
speaker
mr.
deatherage,
i
guess
there's
some
question,
is
there
not,
whether
this
is
indeed
medical
treatment?
unknown
speaker
if...
if
a
child
had
to
have
some
medication
administered
routinely
during
the
school
day
in
order
to
remain
in
school
would
it
be
your
position
that
it
constitutes
medical
treatment
for
someone
at
the
school
to
administer
the
medication?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
this
the
same
kind
of
a
thing?
the
doctor
prescribes
it,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
administered
by
a
physician?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
is
giving
medication
medical
treatment,
in
your
view
and
in
texas
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
deatherage,
let
me
interrupt.
the
little
girl
amber
is
a
good
bit
older
now,
isn't
she?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know...
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opposing
counsel...
is
she
able
herself
to
administer
cic
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
because
it
was
going
to
be
mine
if
she
hadn't
asked
it,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
your
answer.
suppose
this
were
a
prescription
drug,
and
it
was
just
a
question
of
the...
someone
in
the
school
digging
it
out
every
four
hours
and
handing
it
to
amber.
you
would
say
this
was
not
medical
treatment.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
follow
up
on
that
question?
your
reply
brief
has
the
statute
about
the
immunity
from
liability
if
they
follow
that
procedure.
is
it
your
suggestion
that
until
that
statute
was
passed,
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
law
for
that
procedure
to
have
been
followed?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
had
no
immunity
from
liability.
but
assume
that
there
was
no
negligence,
and
all
the
employee
did,
they
didn't
follow...
there's
no
statute
to
protect
them...
but
could
not
the
employee
have
performed
the
procedure
without
doing
anything
unlawful?
just
without
immunity
is
all.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
no
immunity
issue
in
this
case,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
deatherage,
is
it
your
position
that
under
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act
that
if
you're
correct
and
the
school
does
not
have
to
provide
cic
in
a
regular
school,
do
you
agree
that
nevertheless
the
state
must
provide
then
some
kind
of
special,
separate
school
for
amber's
education?
unknown
speaker
is
that
likely
to
cost
more
than
to
keep
her
in
the
public
school
and
provide
cic?
unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
we
have
to
look,
mr.
deatherage,
at
what
is
a
medical
service
to
federal
law
for
defining
that
for
purposes
of
this
act
without
regard
to
how
texas
law
might
treat
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
my
question.
would
we
have
to
decide
what
is
a
medical
service
with
reference
only
to
federal
law,
or
do
we
have
to
look
to
state
law
to
determine
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
can
vary
from
state
to
state
then--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court,
i
notice
on
page
11a
of
your
petition,
cited
a
commentary
which
indicated
that
in
footnote
12
that
it
agreed
with
you;
that
the
statute
tolerated
state-to-state
variance.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
statute
also
admits
school
district
to
school
district
variations,
depending
upon
the
personnel
that
are
available?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
had
a
pupil
who
had
a
lower
back
disk
problem
or
a
cervical
disk
problem
and
had
to
be
in
traction
periodically?
would
you
think
traction
would
be
required
as
a
related--
unknown
speaker
--you
could
have
some
kinds
of
traction
right
in
the
classroom.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
understand
from
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
under
texas
law
that
a
nonmedical
person
would
be
allowed
to
administer...
to
perform
the
cic.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
mean
a
doctor.
i
mean
how
about
a
nurse?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
really
is
will
the
school
have
to
employ
somebody
that
they
ordinarily
wouldn't
employ
in
order
to
carry
out
this
procedure?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they
did?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
what
if
it
were...
what
if
they...
what
if
under
the
law
or
in
their
judgment
in
order
to
carry
out
this
procedure
they
would
have
to
hire
an
additional
person
that
they
wouldn't
ordinarily
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
act
require
them
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
wouldn't
require
them
to
buy
a
piece
of
equipment
like
a
catheter.
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
been
catheterized?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
so
simple?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
your
opposition
whether
at
her
now
more
advanced
age
she
is
able
to
do
this
herself.
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
entire
procedure
must
be
performed
by
someone
else?
unknown
speaker
do
texas
schools
provide
a
nurse
for
every
school,
or
do
they
have
a
visiting
nurse
that
moves
around
from
one
to
another?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
were
a
school
nurse
in
the
building,
that
would
solve
the
problem,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
would
this
not
mean
that
that
person,
after
training,
would
be
required
to
be
there
at
least
five
hours
a
day?
is
that
the
school
day
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
five
or
six
hours
a
day.
unknown
speaker
well,
from
what
you
just
said,
mr.
todd,
then
would
your
answer
to
justice
white's
earlier
question...
does
the
school
district
have
to
hire
someone
who
would
not
have
to
be
hired
without
this
provision...
wouldn't
that
be
yes?
unknown
speaker
who...
whom
do
they
use?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
make
the
teacher
leave
the
class
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
todd,
did
you
stipulate
that
it's
a
medical
service?
unknown
speaker
but
you
stipulated
that
it
was
such
a
service?
unknown
speaker
is
there
also
a
requirement
that
it
not
be
an
undue
burden
on
the
state?
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
act,
not
medical
services.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
current
definition?
and
at
the
present
time
has
the
department
of
education
focused
specifically
on
cic
to
define
whether
that
is
or
is
not
a
medical
service?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your...
the
case
is
over
if
we
agree
with
you
that
this
is
not
a
medical
service?
isn't
there
still
a...
isn't
there
still
an
argument
that
the
kind
of
supportive
services
that
the...
supportive
services
covered
by
the
related
services
provision
are
services
connected
with
the
learning
process?
well,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
no...
is
i
don't
believe
the
case
is
completely
over,
but
i
do
think
that
when
you
go
through
the
analysis
of
what
a
related
service
is
supposed
to
do,
it
still
supports
the
decision
of
the
district
and
circuit
court.
the
statute
requires
those
supportive
services
that
are
needed
to
assist
the
child
to
benefit
from
education,
and
i
think
there
are
three
ways
that
have
been
identified.
of
course,
you
wouldn't...
if
you're
right,
they
wouldn't
needed
to
have
listed
transportation
at
all,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
only
listed
one...
one
specific
supportive
service.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
had
a
paraplegic
patient?
unknown
speaker
a
paraplegic
pupil.
unknown
speaker
and
it
required
a
wheelchair
with
a
special
lift
onto
a
bus
or
car.
unknown
speaker
and
then
assistance
in
leaving
at
the
time
when
he
arrived
at
the
school.
would
that
all
be
covered
by
transportation?
unknown
speaker
is
there
an
issue
here
about...
about
a
violation
under
another
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
you
defend
that?
unknown
speaker
didn't
our
davis
case
pretty
much
say
there
was...
there
was
no
affirmative
action
requirement?
unknown
speaker
i
think
davis
goes
a
little
further
than
that,
indicating
that
it's
a
question
of
not
discriminating
rather
than
providing
special
services.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
the
argument...
i
think
that
your
argument
is
much
stronger
under
the
first
act
than
it
is
under
this
act.
unknown
speaker
would
you
just
automatically
say
that
anything
that
violates...
that
because
it
violated
the
education
act
that
it
violates
section
504?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you...
you...
you...
you
think
you
could
have
just
proceeded
under
504
alone.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
would
have
won.
unknown
speaker
well,
has...
has
it
been
held
that...
that
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
is
not
exclusive?
i
know
that
the
lower
court
here
held
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think...
and
do
you
anticipate
that
that
case
may
settle
this
particular
issue?
unknown
speaker
it
preempts
attorney's
fees,
too,
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
just
a
question
of
how
worried
you
are
about
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose...
i
suppose,
counsel,
that
physical
therapy
can
often
be
by...
on
prescription
of
a
physician
and
nonetheless
required
to
be
provided
by
the
public
school
under
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
a
child
with
the
spina
bifida
condition
cannot
qualify
as
a
handicapped
child
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
what
the
orthopedic
impairment
was?
there
seems
to
be
a
great
mystery
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
had
comments
all
through
the
argument
about
an
orthopedic
impairment,
and
no
one
ever
said
what
it
was.
because
it
seemed
to
me
we're
talking
basically
about
a
urological
problem,
and
urology
and
orthopedics
are
somewhat
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
this
case
turns
on
whether...
whether
under
state
law
administering
cic
is
a
medical
service,
aren't
we...
aren't
we
entitled
to
rely
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
let's
suppose
that
it
was...
that
you
just
agreed
that
this
was
not
a
medical
service
within
the...
within
the
meaning
of...
of
the...
of
the
act.
it
was
not
medical
service.
then
would
you
concede
that
this
is
a...
another
supportive
service?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
for
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
court...
that
may
be
true,
but
the
court
of
appeals
nevertheless
said
it
was
not
a
medical
service
within
the
meaning
of
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act,
didn't
it?
and
that
nothing
in
state
law
made
it
so.
it
had
to
hold
that.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
confident
that
you're
not
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
matter
of
texas
law?
unknown
speaker
are
you
confident
that
you
are
not
asking
us
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
matter
of
texas
law,
strictly
texas
law,
about
texas
doctors
and
medicine
and
things
like
that?
