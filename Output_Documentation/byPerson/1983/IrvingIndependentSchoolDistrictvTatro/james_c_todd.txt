mr.
james
c.
todd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
true
issue
of
this
case
before
the
court
is
one
of
access
to
public
education;
more
specifically,
whether
an
eight-year
old
girl
of
normal
intelligence
who
is
capable
of
doing
schoolwork
in
regular
public
elementary
school
will
be
able
to
attend
class
in
a
regular
public
elementary
school
alongside
her
nonhandicapped
age
group
peers.
if
she
is
to
receive
a
free
public
education
in
the
public
schools,
it's
been
found
as
a
fact
that
she
must
be
provided
the
safe,
simple,
quick,
effective
and
inexpensive
service
of
clean
intermittent
catherization.
as
was
brought
out
this
morning
in
questioning
by
justices
o'connor
and
blackmun,
the
service
of
clean
intermittent
catheterization
is
closely
analogous
to
the
dispensing
of
medication
by
school
personnel
during
the
school
day
to
permit
a
handicapped
child
to
attend
school.
and
that
service,
even
the
petitioners
concede,
is
not
medical
treatment
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
for
example,
an
orthopedically
handicapped
child
who
suffers
arthritic
pain
may
have
his
physician
prescribe
for
him
aspirin
at
regular
intervals
during
the
school
day.
without
the
provision
of
that
medication,
the
pain
that
is
a
symptom
of
his
handicap
may
prevent
him
from
participating
in
a
public
education.
with
the
provision
of
the
medication,
the
child
has
access
to
a
free
public
education.
a
similar
analogy
would
be
the
child
disabled
by
the
handicap
of
epilepsy
whose
physician
prescribes
anti-seizure
medication
during
the
school
day.
mr.
james
c.
todd
probably
not,
your
honor,
in
that
the
traction
would
actually
remove
the
child
from
the
public
educational
setting,
so
that
this
would
not
be
a
service.
mr.
james
c.
todd
riqht.
well,
the...
to
the
extent
that
medical
equipment...
equipment
is
involved,
the
school
district
would
not
be
required
to
provide
the
equipment,
just
as
it
is
not
required
to
provide
the
catheter
in
this
case,
and
just
as
it
is
not
required
to
provide,
for
example,
a
hearing
aid.
however,
the
school
district
would
have
to
make
some
accommodations
so
that
a...
a
child
who
is
in
traction,
and
if
there
are
not
other
reasons
to
remove
him,
would
be
able
to
attend
and
participate.
i
think
that
the...
what
makes
the
catheterization
so
analogous
to
the
type
of
service
we
talked
about
this
morning
is
that
although
it
is
prescribed
by
a
physician,
it
is
actually
delivered
quite
easily
by
nonmedical
school
personnel.
and
although
it
can
be
said
to
treat
a
health-related
symptom
of
the
handicap,
it
is
a
service
that's
needed
to
enable
the
child
to
have
access
to
the
public
education.
mr.
james
c.
todd
oh,
under
texas
law
it's
quite
permissible,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
or
even
someone
other
than
a
nurse
such
as
the
aide.
mr.
james
c.
todd
no,
your
honor,
they
would
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
they
could
choose
to.
they
could
choose--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--that
would
still
not
offend
the
act,
your
honor,
in
that
if
you'll
notice--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes.
and,
for
example--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
and
the
example
i
wanted
to
give
you,
the
act
specifically
requires
physical
therapy,
occupational
therapy,
speech
pathologists
and
audiologists,
and
then
it
states
that
state
standards
must
determine
the
qualifications
of
these
individuals.
a
licensed
physical
therapist
is
the
person
who
must
provide
physical
therapy.
in
the
past,
school
districts
were
not
required
to
hire
physical
therapists.
now
they
are.
this
is
something
that
congress
recognized
needed
to
be
done.
it
was...
it
was
discussed
and
considered
that
one
of
the
implications
of
the
education
of
the
handicapped,
as
amended,
is
that
school
districts
would
be
doing
things
they
had
not
done
in
the
past
and
would
be
hiring
certain
types
of
personnel.
one
type
of
personnel
they
don't
have
to
hire
is
a
physician,
but
we
haven't
asked
them
to
do
that.
the...
the...
the
service
of
catheterization,
it
has
to
be
remembered,
is
so
simple,
it's
so
simple
that
a
person
of
average
intelligence
can
be
trained
to
do
it
in
about
30
minutes.
mr.
james
c.
todd
i
never
have,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
i'm
relying
upon
the
record
and
the
testimony
of
the
people
who
have
at
least
been
engaged
in
providing
it.
for
example,
it's
undisputed
in
the
evidence
that
almost
certainly
and
probably
very
soon
amber
will
be
able
to
provide
this
service
herself,
possibly--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--she's
not
quite
able
to
do
all
the
steps,
but
she's
very
close.
she
can
actually
do
the
insertion,
for
example;
and
it's
not
inconceivable
that
this
summer
she
may
even
be
able
to
do
it.
so
that
at
base,
what
the
petitioner's
claim
comes
down
to
is
that
a
service
which
an
eight-year
old
handicapped
child
can...
can
do
is
so
complicated,
so
burdensome,
so
expensive
that
a...
and
so
medical
that
a
school
district
shouldn't
be
required
to
do
it.
surely
this
is
not
among
the
greater
burdens
that
a
school
district
will
ever
be
required
by
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
to
incur.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes,
your
honor.
that...
that
she
needs
adult
assistance
in
the
sense
that,
for
example,
obviously
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
clean
intermittent
catheterization
functions
as
a
substitute
for
voluntary
urination.
no
child
could
attend
school
throughout
a
school
day
without
provisions
made
for
certain
normal
bodily
functions
like
eating,
like
toilet--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--it
varies...
it
varies
from...
from
district
to
district.
but
the...
the--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--if...
well,
actually
the
problem
wouldn't
even
be
there
unless
you
assume
that
a
school
nurse
has
to
do
it.
but
certainly
if
there
is
a
school
nurse
present
and...
and
it's
preferred
that
a
nurse
do
it...
certainly
a
nurse
is
among
those
who
can...
then
that
makes
it
much
easier.
other
arrangements...
because
it
is
such
a
simple
service,
we're
not
facing
the
type
of
situation
as,
for
example,
school
districts
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
physical
therapy
personnel.
it's...
it's
unquestionable
in
the
act
that
they
have
to
provide
physical
therapy
to
those
children
who
need
it
in
order
to
benefit
from
education,
and
there
are
arrangements
for
the
state
to
assist
local
districts
who
don't
have
the
resources
themselves.
but
we're
not
even
faced
with
that
problem
here
because
we're
dealing
with
a
service,
and
even
the...
which
even
the
amicus
brief
which
is
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
district
court
opinion
that
was
by
the
dallas
medical
society
and
the
texas
medical
association,
recognized
that
average
lay
people
with
a
minimum
of
training
can
provide
this
service.
it's...
it's
not
one
that
requires
highly
technical
training,
highly
specialized
credentials
or
a
great
deal
of
trouble.
mr.
james
c.
todd
well,
probably--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--within
range.
certainly
available.
there
should
be
somebody
who
will
be
available
at
the
times
needed.
there
is
some
variation.
this
is
why
it's
so
much
more
feasible
for
the...
for
the
school
district
to
employ
personnel
to
do
it
and
why
in
many
cases
it...
it
just
simply
can't
be
done
unless
the
school
provides
personnel
to
do
it.
and
if
it's
not
done,
the
child
doesn't
go
to
school.
and
this
is
what
must
be
balanced.
whenever
examining
whatever
burden
it's
concluded
this
service
imposes
on
the
school
district--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--no,
it
does
not
have
to
hire
someone.
i
think
the
answer
would
be
no.
the
aide
or
the
teacher--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--there
are
adults
present
in
the
school
environment.
they
could
choose
to,
if
they--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--or
aide.
there
are
classroom...
one
of
the
provisions
under
the
act
is
that
there
be
classroom
aides
to
assist
handicapped
children
to
be
in...
in
regular
classrooms.
the
preference
in
the
act
is
wherever
it
can
be
done,
handicapped
children
be
educated
alongside
nonhandicapped
children.
one
way
of
facilitating
that
is
that
there
are
classroom
aides
who
assist
the
teacher;
and
since
we're
only
talking
about
a
small
amount
of
time,
the
aide
could...
i
think
it
could
be
feasibly
arranged...
there
are
certainly
more
difficult
arrangements
in
other
cases
that
have
to
be
made...
for
an
adult
already
present
in
the
educational
environment
to
assist
amber
with
this.
now,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
the
only
feasible
way
to
do
it
is
to
hire
an
additional
person,
the
additional
person
that's
hired
does
not
have
to
be
a
highly
specialized,
i.e.,
expensive,
person
to
hire.
and
there's...
just
the
fact
of
having
to
hire
additional
personnel
does
not
offend
the
act
because
of--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--it
was
stipulated
that
it
can
be
called
a
medical
treatment,
and
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
address
that.
one
of
the
things
that's
led
to
so
much
misunderstanding
is
the
assumption
that
the
word
"medical"
has
a
fixed
meaning
from
one
context
to
another,
and
i'd
like
to
give
you
an
example.
in
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act,
medical
service
is
defined
not
to
include
physical
therapy,
occupational
therapy,
speech
pathology,
audiology,
psychologic
services.
now,
in
another
act
of
congress,
the
medicaid
statute,
42
u.s.
code
1396
and
the
sections
following,
those
very
same
services,
by
name,
are
defined
as
medical
services.
so
it's
obvious
that
congress
is
not
using
the
word
"medical"
with
as
much
scope
in
each
situation.
and
it
was
the
task
of
the
department
of
education
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
where
to
draw
the
line.
and
i
think
what
the
department
did
was
to
balance
two
policies
that
are
clear
in
the
act.
one
is
the
policy
of
nonexclusion,
or
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
board
of
education
v.
rowley
case,
the
inclusion
into
public
school
of
previously
excluded
handicapped
children.
on
the
other
hand,
balanced
against
that
was
that
strictly
medical
services
are
not
included
in
the
array
of
related
services.
and
the
way
they
drew
the
line
was
to
define
medical
services
as
the
services
of
a
licensed
physician.
that
protects
the
school
district
from
the
most
expensive
type
of
medical
services
they
might
be
called
upon
to
provide
and--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--that
it
can
be...
it's...
it
was...
well,
i
didn't
do
the
stipulation,
but
it
was
stipulated
that
it's
medical
in
the
sense
that
a
physician
prescribes
it
for
medical
reasons,
but
that...
just
as
a
physician
might
prescribe
physical
therapy,
for
example,
for
a
medical
treatment
purpose,
for
example,
the
prevention
of
the
atrophy
of
muscle
tissue.
but
that
would
not
exclude
it
as
a
service
that
is
also
needed
during
school
hours
to
enable
the
child
to
be
educated.
we're
not
asking
here
that
a
school
district
cure
the
child
of
the
handicap.
and
so
the
amount
of
catheterization
that
amber
happens
to
receive
during
the
school
day
would
not
by
itself
be
enough
to
accomplish
the
complete
medical
purpose,
because
she
still
needs
it
elsewhere.
but
it
is
what
she
needs
in
order
to
be
present
in
class.
the
related
services
include
those
supportive
services
which
are
needed
to
assist
the
child
to
benefit
from
education;
and
this
court
in
the
rowley
case
stressed
educational
benefit
as
the
crux
of
an
appropriate
education.
it's
clear
from
the--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes...
well,
there
is
the
requirement
discerned
by
this
court
in
the
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis
case
concerning
section
504
that
the
accommodations...
that
a
state
cannot
be
required
to
undertake
undue
burden
in
order
to
accommodate
someone
who's
not
an
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual.
however,
in
this
case,
amber
is...
clearly
falls
within
the
definition
of
an
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual.
she
meets
all
the
requirements
that
are
needed
to
qualify
a
child
or
make
a
child
eligible
for
a
free
public
education.
given
that,
there
are
some
accommodations
that
need
to
be
made
to
permit
her
access
to
public
school.
here--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
as
used
in
the
act.
and
this
has
been
the...
right.
as
medical
services
are
treated
in
the
act...
and
remember
again
that
medical
services
is
defined...
is
used
in
such
a
way
that
it
doesn't
include
physical
things
like
physical
therapy,
which
usually
requires
a
doctor's
prescription;
occupational
therapy,
which
in
some
states
requires
a
doctor's
prescription;
audiology,
some
of
whose
functions
require
a
physician's
prescription.
and
exercising
its
discretion
as
the
executive
agency
charged
with
implementing
the
statute,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
looking
at
the
total
situation,
drew
the
line
at
physician-provided
services.
mr.
james
c.
todd
the
department
of
education
considered...
considered
excluding
clean
intermittent
catheterization,
or
at
least
they
took
up
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be,
because
it
was
receiving
a
lot
of
discussion.
there's
a
passage
from
the
most
recent
department
of
education
commentary
on
this
point
that's
quoted
in
part,
in
part
by
the
petitioner's
reply
brief.
the
very
next
sentence
of
that
passage,
which
is
not
included
in
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
states
that
"clean
intermittent
catheterization
will
continue
to
be
a
service
for
which
a
state
can
be
reimbursed
under
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act.
"
so
the
department
of
education
has
not
made
any
definitive
ruling
to
exclude
it.
they've
considered
the
question,
they've
heard
a
lot
of
arguments
on
both
sides
just
as
this
court
is
hearing,
but
there
is
no
policy
ruling
that
excludes
it.
mr.
james
c.
todd
well,
i
think
they
were
listing
those
as...
as
examples.
mr.
james
c.
todd
well,
they
listed...
they
gave
an
example.
they
gave
a
limited
set
of
examples.
if
you
take
seriously
the
requirement
that
the
school
districts
are
going
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
handicapped
children
on
an
individualized
basis,
it
has
to
be
recognized
that
in
1975
congress
couldn't
have
listed
all
the
services
that
might
have
been
provided.
mr.
james
c.
todd
they
gave
an
illustrative
list.
and
if
the...
if
i
can,
i
think
there
are
three
ways
that
i
can
discuss
in
which
this
service
is
needed
to
assist
amber
to
benefit
from
special
education.
congress
clearly
envisioned
a
number
of
types
of
educational
benefit.
one,
of
course,
is
the
benefit
of
an
academic
instruction
in
the
classroom;
and
we've
discussed
how
this
is
needed
in
order
to
get
amber
to
the
classroom
and
allow
her
to
remain
there,
just
as
physical
therapy
might
work
with
a
child's
mobility
so
that
a
child
can
move
from
room
to
room
or
so
that
a
child
can
get
into
a
desk
and
get
out
of
it.
but
there's
another
important
educational
benefit
to
which
congress
attached
at
least
as
much
importance,
and
that's
the
benefit
derived
from
just
being
in
that
classroom
with
nonhandicapped
children,
with
sharing
the
normal
educational
experience
in
public
schools
that
shapes
most
people
and
prepares
them
for
independent
life
in
the
community.
that's
a
key
benefit,
and
so
much
stress
is
laid
on
it
in
both
the
legislative
history
and
the
key
words
of
the
act
that
it's
clear
that...
in
fact,
it
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
child
is
not
to
be
denied
that
benefit
unless
it
just
can't
be
provided,
even
with
the
use
of
supplementary
aids
and
services.
so
that
the
only
children
who
should
be
removed
from
this
normal
educational
experience
are
those
whose
special
instructional
needs
are
so
complex
and
so
special
that
they
can
only
be
provided
in
an
environment
that's
separate.
but
here
there's
no
question
but
that
the
type
of
instruction
that
amber
can
benefit
from,
not
to
mention
the
extracurricular
activities
that
the
national
school
board
association
amicus
referred
to,
all
the
attributes
of
normal
public
school
experience,
that
for
amber
the
type
of
instruction
needed
is
precisely
the
kind
that
can
be
provided
in
a
regular
public
school
setting.
and
for
that
reason,
the
act
mandates
that
she
be
given
a
service,
especially
a
service
as
simple
as
this,
which
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
she'll
even
be
able
to
do
for
herself.
mr.
james
c.
todd
excuse
me?
mr.
james
c.
todd
right.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes.
mr.
james
c.
todd
it
is
covered.
and
while
we're
on
the
subject
of
wheelchair,
let
me
recall
a
very
important
example
that's
given
in
the
legislative
history
by
both
the
principal
co-author
of
section
504,
senator
humphrey,
and
one
of
the
major
co-authors
of
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act,
senator
stafford.
they
gave
the
example
of
a
building
that's
architecturally
inaccessible,
and
said...
each
of
them
said
it's
still
discrimination
not
to
do
something,
even
if...
whether
it's
a
ramp
or
whether
it's
adult
assistance
to
go
and
get
the
child
and
bring
the
child
up;
that
for
a
school
district...
a
school
district
is
still
violating
both
acts
by
failing
to
extend
that
additional
service
needed
to
overcome
this
obstacle.
now,
in
amber's
case,
the
obstacle
is
different,
but
it's
an
obstacle
posed
by
the
handicap;
that
is,
to
get
through
a
school
day
she
needs
adult
assistance
with
her
toileting
function.
if
she
receives
that
adult
assistance,
which
involves
a
very
small
amount
of
time
and
trouble,
then
she
can
share
with
other
children
the
public
school
experience
that
congress
wanted
to
make
available
to
the
maximum
extent
practicable
to
handicapped
children.
if
she
doesn't
receive
the
service,
then
she
can't
be
there.
and
the
cost...
it
was
brought
out
in
questioning
this
morning,
i
believe
by
justice
o'connor,
as
to
the
disparity
in
cost
between
excluding
her
and
segregating
her
from
the
regular
public
school
system.
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
cost
is
not
only
in
terms
of
the
extra
amount
of
dollars
which
the
taxpayers
have
to
pay
to
support
her
in
this
expensive
private
school;
there's
a
cost
in
frustrating
the
intent
of
congress.
congress
made
the
judgment
that
the...
whatever
additional
burdens
are
required
to
admit
handicapped
children
and
integrate
them
into
the
normal
public
school
experience
is
more
than
offset
by
the
savings
in
that
by
being
part
of
this
normal
experience,
which
is
social
as
well
as
instructional,
they
are
better
prepared
to
be
independent
in
later
life,
which
means
that
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
they
don't
have
to
be
paid,
for
example,
supplemental
security
income,
or
they
don't
have
to
be
paid
as
much;
they
don't
have
to
be
institutionalized;
they
don't
have
to
have
as
many
adults
or
as
many
publicly
paid
caretakers
to
assist
them.
and
this
also
is...
it's
a
policy
judgment
congress
made,
for
better
or
for
worse.
looking
at
that
policy
and
trying
to
judge
the
facts
of
this
case
in
terms
of
it,
it's
clear
that...
i
think,
that
the
balance
should
be
struck
in
favor
of
amber
to
provide
this
service,
allow
her
to
participate,
and
that
this
falls
well
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
especially
as
illuminated
by
the
regulations
involved.
and
it
also
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
under
the
nondiscrimination
against
the
handicapped
statute.
mr.
james
c.
todd
yes,
your
honor.
the
courts
below
also
found
a
violation
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--yes,
sir.
it's
the...
it...
the
section
504
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap
against
a
qualified
handicapped
individual
by
recipients
of
federal
financial
assistance.
and
it
was
stipulated
that
these...
that
this
school
district
does
receive
federal
financial
assistance
for
its
special
education
program.
amber
is
an
otherwise
qualified
individual.
all
she
needs
to
be
to
be
otherwise
qualified
at
a
preschool
or
elementary
school
level
is
that
she's
of
the
proper
age
and
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
school
district.
mr.
james
c.
todd
your
honor,
the
davis
case
did
address
the
question
of
affirmative
action,
but
in
that
case
you
had
a
college
student
seeking
to
have
the
standards
of
admission
altered
so
that
she
could
qualify
for
a
program
that
she
didn't
qualify
for.
here,
you
have
the...
the
public
secondary
and
elementary
context,
and
we're
not
asking
for
the
lowering
of
standards.
congress,
at
the
elementary
and
secondary
level,
has
already
made
the
judgment,
and
state
laws
have
already
made
the
judgment
that
it's
a
free
public...
that
everyone
should
have
access
to
it.
so
it's
not
a
question
of
lowering
standards
in
order
to
enable
people
who
were
not
otherwise
qualified
to
become
qualified,
as
has
been
sometimes
the
issue
in
some
of
the
affirmative
action
cases
dealt
with
by
this
court--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
mr.
james
c.
todd
well,
if...
if...
the
davis
case
went
on
to
say
that
technological
advances
can
bring
about
services
which
can
accommodate
the
needs
of
the
handicapped
at
no
undue
burden.
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
just
such
a
service.
its
predecessor,
sterile
catheterization,
was
burdensome
and
somewhat
expensive.
the
technology
has
produced
a
service
which
is
very
easy,
which
even
a
ten-year
old
child
can
do,
and
which
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
the...
to
the
child's
acceptance
and
admission.
and
the
legislative
history
covered
not
only
the
kind
of
overt
discrimination
when
you
put
up
a
sign
that
say
no
handicapped
need
apply,
but
it
also
covered
this
example
of
failure
to
remove
barriers
that
prevent
an
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
person
from
admission.
however,
as
to
whether...
as
to
which
basis
relief
is
grounded
on,
obviously
our
primary
concern
is
that
amber
receive
the
service
and
that
she
be
enabled
to
participate
in
public
school
and
receive
this
education.
mr.
james
c.
todd
i
wouldn't
automatically
say
that,
no,
your
honor.
there
are
some--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--or
under--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--under
education
of
the
handicapped
act
alone
also.
either...
i
think
that
that...
and
there
are
cases
sometimes
where
the
plaintiffs
choose
to
go
under
one
or
the
other.
here,
the
plaintiffs,
you
know,
sought
relief
under
every
statute
that
might--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--right.
i
believe
this
court
recently
heard
arguments
on
that
point.
the--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
it
could.
if
you
ruled
that
the
education
of
the
handicapped
act
preempts
504,
then
that
would
settle
that.
however--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--well,
that
would...
that
would
certainly
be
a
consequence.
i
may
say
this,
although
i
don't
know
in
what
detail
you
want
me
to
argue
the
preemption
issue,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history--
mr.
james
c.
todd
--it's
a
long
story.
actually,
it's
someone
else's
fees
that
are
at
stake.
[laughter]
mr.
james
c.
todd
okay.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
can
just
summarize
by
going
back
to
the
original
point.
this
is
really
an
access
case.
this
is
a
case
that
poses
the
question
of
whether
a
child
who's
capable
of
doing
schoolwork
in
the
public
schools,
who's
entitled
by
law,
will
be
given
the
simple
and
safe
and
inexpensive
service
that
will
permit
her
access
and
prevent
her
exclusion
and
segregation.
thank
you.
