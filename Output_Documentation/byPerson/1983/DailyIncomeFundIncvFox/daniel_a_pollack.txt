mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
shareholder's
action
under
section
36(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
is
exempt
from
the
director
demand
requirement
of
rule
23.1
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
underlying
this
seemingly
narrow
question
are
several
questions
of
perhaps
more
profound
dimension,
some
or
all
of
which
this
court
may
wish
to
consider.
first,
what
exactly
is
a
derivative
action
or,
stated
another
way,
what
are
the
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
for
a
derivative
action?
second,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
director
demand
requirement?
third,
does
an
investment
company
have
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
36(b)?
petitioners'
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
director
demand
requirement
does
apply
to
a
shareholder's
action
under
section
36(b)
because
the
action
is
derivative;
that
the
director
demand
requirement
performs
a
most
valuable
function
of
permitting
pre-litigation
resolution
or
adjustment
of
disputes,
thus
avoiding
needless
litigation;
and
that
the
director
demand
requirement
is
consistent
with
two
long-standing
and
salutary
policies
repeatedly
upheld
by
this
court.
first,
the
exhaustion
of
intracorporate
remedies,
and,
second,
letting
directors
direct.
the
facts
in
this
case
may
be
simply
summarized,
and
they
are
in
our
blue
brief.
the
daily
income
fund
is
a
money
market
fund.
reich
&
tang
are
the
investment
advisors
to
daily
income
fund.
a
majority
of
the
directors
of
daily
income
fund
are
disinterested
directors;
that
is
they
are
in
no
way
affiliated
with
or
associated
with
the
advisor.
in
1981,
martin
fox,
a
minority
shareholder
of
the
daily
income
fund,
instituted
an
action
against
reich
&
tang
allegedly
to
recover
excessive
fees.
in
doing
so,
he
simply
ignored
the
directors
and
by-passed
entirely
the
board.
judge
kevin
t.
duffy
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dismissed
his
complaint
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
director
demand
requirement
of
rule
23.1.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
no
compliance
was
required,
because
the
action
was
not,
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
"strictly
speaking
derivative".
the
court
of
appeals
reached
this
conclusion
because
it
said
that
the
investment
company
itself
had
no
right
of
action
under
section
36(b).
the
court
of
appeals
also
went
on
to
hold
in
a
supplementary
holding
that
demand
on
the
directors
would
be,
in
its
words,
"an
empty,
unfruitful,
and
dilatory
exercise.
"
the
starting
point
of
the
legal
analysis
seems
not
to
be
in
dispute.
rule
23.1
applies
to
and
governs
all
derivative
actions
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
your
honor,
the
full
text
is
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
an
oversight
on
our
part.
we
did
print
it
in
the
second
circuit
brief
as
an
addendum.
unfortunately,
we
did
not
print
it
in
the
supreme
court
brief.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
don't
believe
it
is
printed
in
the
petition
either.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
believe
there
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct.
and,
the
failure
to
do
so
has
repeatedly
been
held
by
courts
for
many,
many
years
to
be
a
basis
for
dismissing
such
an
action.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
believe
that
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
your
honor,
that
position
was
taken
in
the
sec
brief.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
well,
we
state
in
response
to
that,
your
honor,
that
the
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
it
is
more
than
a
mere
pleading
requirement,
that
there
is
a
substantive
requirement
of
demand
intended
by
that
rule.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--i
think
an
action
in
the
federal
court
that
would
conflict
with
the
policy
of
rule
23.1.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
that
is
my
belief,
your
honor.
if
the
starting
point
is
that
rule
23.1
does
apply
to
and
govern
all
derivative
actions
in
the
federal
courts,
the
initial
question
becomes
is
a
shareholder's
action
under
section
36(b)
derivative?
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
derivative
and
congress
has
said
that
it
is
derivative.
in
the
landmark
case
of
burks
against
lasker
decided
by
this
court
four
years
ago,
mr.
justice
brennan,
writing
for
the
unanimous
court,
stated
as
a
general
proposition
a
derivative
suit
is
brought
by
shareholders
to
enforce
a
claim
on
behalf
of
a
corporation.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
your
honor.
more
specifically
and
more
importantly
for
present
purposes,
mr.
justice
brennan
went
on
specifically
to
refer
to
a
suit
under
this
very
section,
section
36(b),
as
a
derivative
suit
at
page
484
of
441
u.s.
mr.
justice
brennan
stated
for
the
unanimous
court,
and
when
congress
did
intend
to
prevent
board
action
from
cutting
off
derivative
suits
it
said
so
expressly.
section
36(b)
added
to
the
act
in
1970,
performs
precisely
this
function
for
derivative
suits
charging
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
advisor
fees.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
unequivocal
and
unambiguous
recognition
by
this
court
of
the
derivative
nature
of
the
shareholder's
action
under
section
36(b).
congress,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
has
also
characterized
such
actions
as
derivative.
in
the
1970
house
report,
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
it
is
stated
at
page
78,
"section
19
of
h.r.
14737
would
add
a
requirement
that
derivative
suits
under
section
36(b)
of
the
act
as
amended
be
brought
by
shareholders
acting
in
good
faith
and
with
justifiable
cause.
"
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
an
essential
ingredient.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
it
is
not,
because
one
possible
construction
of
rule
23.1
is
that
the
corporation
have
a
right...
if,
for
example,
the
corporation
has
a
state
court
right,
we
would
argue
that
that
is
a
right
or
a
right
in
this
case
not
to
be
charged
excessive
fees
which
complies
with
the
literal
language
of
rule
23.1.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
we
take
that
a
back-up
position.
we
believe
in
this
case
that
we
have
demonstrated
and
can
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
the
corporation
could
sue
on
its
own
behalf
under
section
36(b).
one
other
cite
to
the
legislative
history
on
the
characterization
of
a
36(b)
action
as
derivative
will
be
found
at
page
83
of
that
same
1970
house
report.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--i
believe
that
justice
brennan's
definition
in
the
burks
case
is
a
satisfactory
definition;
that
is
to
say
an
action
brought
on
behalf
of
a
corporation
by
a
shareholder.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
your
honor,
i
did
argue
before
this
court
in
that
case.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
that
is
why
i
called
it
landmark,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
pondered
that
long
and
hard
when
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals,
ignoring
the
evidence
of
the
derivative
nature
of
a
section
36(b)
action
which
i
have
just
cited
to
the
court,
that
is
justice
brennan's
statement
in
burks
and
the
house
report
references
to
an
action
as
derivative,
determined
that
this
was
not
a
derivative
action
because
the
company
itself
has
no
right
of
action
under
section
36(b).
to
unravel
that
error,
one
must
look
into
the
question
of
whether
an
investment
company
has
an
implied
right
of
action
under
section
36(b).
to
do
so
we
look--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
we
believe
that
the
recent
cases
of
this
court,
and
i
think
it
is
cannon...
i
may
have
juggled
them
in
my
mind...
while
i
am
standing
here,
i
will
look
before
i
rebut...
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
section
must
be
considered.
and,
in
this
case,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
section
36(b),
which
was
enacted
in
1970,
was
to
strengthen
the
hand
and
role
of
the
independent
directors.
looking
first
at
the
language
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
implied
right,
the
section
itself
says,
in
pertinent
part,
that
a
shareholder
may
sue
"on
behalf
of"
the
investment
company.
we
believe
that
that
is
clearly
suggestive
of
a
derivative
concept.
turning
to
the
legislative
history,
unfortunately,
as
in
many
statutes,
the
legislative
history
appears
to
be
silent
on
the
issue
of
an
implied
right
as
regards
the
investment
company
itself.
therefore,
one
must
look
in
the
terms
of
the
merrill
lynch
and
curran
analysis
to
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
congress
passed
this
section
in
1970.
and,
the
state-of-the-law
was
that
there
was
universal
recognition
of
the
derivative
character
of
a
lawsuit
to
recovery
excessive
fees
from
an
investment
advisor.
we
have
cited
those
cases
at
commonlaw
and
also
under
section
36
which
preceded
36(b)
at
page
10
of
our
blue
brief.
it
follows
necessarily
that
if
those
suits
were
derivative
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
section,
that
they
were
derived
from
a
primary
right
in
the
investment
company
itself.
congress
is,
of
course,
under
the
current
doctrine,
presumed
to
know
the
state-of-the-law
at
the
time
it
enacted
section
36(b)
and
since
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
congressional
intent
to
deny
or
eliminate
that
right
in
the
investment
company,
we
believe
that
the
presumption
should
be
applied
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
preserve
that
right.
to
do
so
is
consistent
with
the
overall
intent
of
the
1970
amendments
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
that
overall
intent
was
in
part
to
strengthen
the
role
of
the
disinterested
directors.
and,
it
makes
good
sense
to
imply
a
right
in
this
situation
because
the
fact
that
a
shareholder
was
granted
a
remedy
to
sue
for
excessive
fees
should
not
mean
that
the
same
remedy
is
not
available
to
the
investment
company
itself.
as
we
argue
in
the
first
page
of
our
reply
brief,
the
yellow-covered
brief,
there
is
something
most
anamolous
about
saying
that
an
investment
company,
if
a
new
group
of
directors
comes
aboard,
has
no
right
to
sue
its
investment
advisor
if
the
directors
feel
that
there
has
been
an
overcharging
merely
because
a
shareholder
does
not
happen
to
raise
the
matter.
i
find
that
a
result
that
is
almost
unthinkable
in
terms
of
interpreteing
a
sensible
intent
on
the
part
of
congress.
the
courts
of
appeals
went
on
in
a
supplementary
holding
to
hold
that
the
application
of
the
director
demand
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
operation
of
section
36(b).
we
believe
this
too
is
erroneous.
the
fact
that
the
directors
may
perhaps
not
be
able
to
terminate
a
section
36(b)
action,
a
doctrine
that
is
much
talked
about
in
the
industry
as
a
result
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
dictum
in
burks
does
not--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--no.
that
is
a
fair
criticism.
we
can
well
live
with
this,
be
it
holding
or
dictum,
because
the
fact
is
that
the
termination
doctrine
does
not
obviate
the
benefit
of
the
demand
rule.
the
termination...
the
mere
fact
that
directors
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
terminate
a
section
36(b)
action
does
not
render
nugatory
the
value
of
having
a
demand
rule
here
and
that
value
is
to
prevent,
before
there
is
litigation,
unnecessary
litigation,
to
let
the
directors
rethink
the
question
as
to
whether
there
has
been
an
overcharge,
to
let
the
directors
convince
the
shareholder
that
perhaps
he
is
wrong.
it
goes
both
ways.
but,
in
any
event,
we
believe
that
it
is
a
salutary
rule.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
but
there
is
the
damoclesian
sword
of
the
complaint
hanging
over
their
head
and
we
believe
the
purpose
of
the
demand
rule
is
to
provide
for
pre-litigation
considerations,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
in
our
judgment,
the
second
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
supplementary
holding.
the
statute
of
limitations,
this
one-year
statute
provided
by
section
36(b)(2)
is
not
shortened,
it
is
simply
advanced.
to
give
a
simple
example,
if
on
january
1
of
a
given
year
a
shareholder
makes
a
demand
and
the
demand
is
responded
to
and
the
demand
is
rejected,
on
march
1
he
institutes
litigation.
he
may
recover
the
period
march
1
to
march
1
instead
of
january
1
to
january
1.
there
is
no
saying
which
period
of
is
better,
but,
in
any
event,
there
is
no
shortening
of
the
period
by
this
pre-litigation
demand.
it
is
simply
an
advancing
of
the
period.
at
this
point
i
will
be
seated
and
await
my
rebuttal.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
meyer
would
set
at
naught
or
ascribe
little
value
to
the
independent
directors
of
the
mutual
fund
and
suggests
that
congress
did
so
in
the
legislative
history.
we
believe
otherwise.
footnote
15
at
page
485
of
442
u.s.
represents
a
summation
of
the
legislative
history
by
justice
brennan
in
which
he
concludes
with
this
observation:
"congress
surely
would
not
have
entrusted
such
critical
functions
as
approval
of
advisory
contracts
and
selection
of
accountants
to
the
statutorily
disinterested
directors
had
it
shared
the
court
of
appeals'
view
that
such
directors
could
never
be
disinterested
where
their
codirectors
of
investment
advisors
were
concerned.
"
similarly
at
pages
4900
and
4903
of
the
senate
report,
there
is
amply
supporting
reference
to
our
position
that
a
central
purpose
of
these
amendments
of
1970
was
to
strengthen
the
disinterested
directors.
mr.
meyer
seeks
to
simply
treat
them
as
if
they
are
not
there.
secondly,
mr.
meyer
suggests
that
if
there
is
no
right
in
the
investment
company
the
directors
are
not
rendered
powerless
because
they
can
go
to
the
sec
and
ask
them
to
sue
or
they
can
bring
an
action
as
shareholders
themselves.
well,
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
functions
of
directors.
directors
are
to
direct.
they
need
not
go
to
the
sec
under
any
state
corporate
law
with
which
i
am
familiar
and
ask
the
sec
to
do
their
work
for
them.
and,
similarly
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
be
shareholders
of
the
investment
company
in
order
to
serve
as
directors.
therefore,
i
suggest
that
this
second
solution
is
inadequate.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
they
were
not
given
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--there
is
a
dispute,
of
course,
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
they
have
failed
and
that
is
the
very
function
of
the
demand
rule,
to
enable
a
dialogue
to
go
forward
and
for
the
directors
to
say--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--we
have
argued
as
a
back-up
position
in
our
brief
that
we
are
still
within
the
language
of
rule
23.1,
because
we
have
a
right
not
to
be
charged
excessive
fees.
it
may
not
be
a
right
under
section
36(b).
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
suppose
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility,
but
if
those
directors
were
lawyers
that
would
get
them
into
quite
a
bit
of
hot
water
ethically.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
would
not
want
to
be
a
director-lawyer
and
be
someone
seeking
a
plaintiff
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
a
harder
case,
i
agree.
but,
i
don't
think
the
corporate
law
of
any
state
of
which
i
am
familiar
envisions
that
the
directors
shall
go
out
and
find
a
shareholder
to
do
their
work
for
them.
i
think
that
the
power
resides
in
the
directors
to
act
for
the
corporation.
otherwise,
they
are
obduring
and
abdicating.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
gets
into
the
issue
raised
by
justice
brennan's
statement
about
cutting
off.
the
argument
would
be
made
if
they
can't
cut
it
off,
then
they
can't
intervene
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
it
off.
and,
i
think
there
would
be--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--i
suppose
in
theory
that
is
possible
that
the
directors
could
seek
to
intervene.
of
course,
that
would...
on
behalf
of
the
corporation.
i
should
think
that
that
would
necessarily
imply,
if
they
can
do
that,
that
they
do
have...
or
that
the
investment
company
does
have
a
right
of
action
under
section
36(b)
and
that
they
are
asserting
it
in
litigation.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
because
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--no.
you
say
if
daily
income
fund
had
not
been
named
as
a
defendant
at
all?
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
i
suppose
i
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
we
are
asserting
that
the
company
has
a
right
to
determine
whether
the
litigation
shall
proceed
in
the
first
instance
and--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--i
think
that
the
fund
has
an
important
function
in
this
circumstance
and
is
represented
by
the
independent
directors.
if
the
independent
directors
had
met
with
mr.
fox,
several
things
might
have
happened.
mr.
fox
might
have
been
convinced--
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
--as
a
defendant,
it
in
theory
cannot
receive
that
money
and
that,
i
suppose,
goes
to
the
question
you
asked
mr.
meyer
about
whether
they
are
improperly
aligned.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
if
there
is
a
recovery.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
pollack
the
final
point
about
mr.
meyer's
argument,
the
use
of
section
16(b)
as
an
analogy,
we
think
is
inapt,
because
section
16(b)
has
its
own
demand
rule.
i
would
say
that,
if
i
may
in
conclusion,
that
the
blanket
and
what
we
view
as
absolutist
disabling
of
the
independent
directors
of
investment
companies
by
the
second
circuit,
which
the
second
circuit
imposed
in
burks
and
which
was
repudiated
by
this
court
in
burks,
has
arisen
once
again.
the
second
circuit
in
this
case,
for
whatever
reason,
seems
to
have
either
failed
to
grasp
or
decline
to
follow
the
logic
and
spirit
of
this
court's
opinion
in
burks
and
we
believe
that
the
second
circuit
should
be
reversed
once
again.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
