unknown
speaker
mr.
pollack,
where
in
your
brief
will
we
find
the
full
text
of
23.1?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
in
your
brief
even
though
that
is
the
controlling--
unknown
speaker
--how
about
your
petition?
unknown
speaker
yes,
page
19a
of
the
petition,
footnote
six.
you
didn't
really--
--it
is
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
there
is
no
literal
non-compliance
with
the
rule,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
merely
requires
"that
the
complaint
shall
allege
with
particularity
to
efforts,
if
any,
made
by
the
plaintiff
to
obtain
the
action
he
desires
of
the
director.
"
he
didn't
make
any
efforts,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
but,
is
that
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
literally
rule
23
does
not
require
a
demand.
it
merely
requires
a
description
of
whatever
demand
was
made.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
is
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
as
a
matter
of
state
law...
say
the
state
of
new
york
might
provide
that
there
is
no
such
requirement,
it
is
an
in
new
york
corporation
to
be
a
valid
state
law?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
of
new
york
do
that
if
it
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
state
of
new
york
would
not
have
the
power
to
do
that
in
view
of
the
way
rule
23
has
been
construed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollack,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
23.1,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
pollack,
is
it
an
essential
ingredient
of
being
a
derivative
action
that
the
corporation
could
have
brought
suit
on
its
own
behalf?
unknown
speaker
so
you
adhere
to
the
view
that
you
took
in
your
brief,
i
take
it,
that
in
order
for
an
action
to
be
a
23.1
one
need
not
show
that
the
corporation
could
have
sued
on
its
own
behalf?
unknown
speaker
you
have
been
doing
a
lot
of
cross
referencing
between
legislative
history,
opinions
of
this
court,
language
of
the
rule.
how
would
you
define
the
term
"derivative"
as
it
is
used
in
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
were
in
that
case
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
did
you
win?
unknown
speaker
that
messes
with
your
averages,
you
know.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
doesn't
36(b)
provide
in
so
many
words
who
may
bring
an
action
under
it?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
ever
get
to
an
implied
question
then?
if
congress
just
states
generally
that
a
suit
may
be
brought,
without
saying
who
may
bring
it,
you
probably
have
room
for
implied
analysis
under
cort
against
ash.
but,
when
congress
says
this
is
the
kind
of
action
that
can
be
brought
and
it
may
be
brought
by
an
(a),
a
(b),
or
a
(c),
isn't
that
pretty
well
the
ball
game?
how
would
you
ever
imply
that
also
a
(d)
could
bring
it?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
refer
to
justice
brennan's
earlier
statement
in
his
opinion,
the
opinion
for
the
court,
as
dicta.
i
take
it
what
comes
out
right
of
the
opinion
and
what
comes
out
bad
is
dicta.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
the
director
start
to
rethink
as
soon
as
the
complaint
is
served?
unknown
speaker
just
as
the
statute
of
limitations
is
always
looming
in
the
background.
there
is
a
limit
on
the
time
that
they
can
do
their
rethinking,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
stop
you
there?
i
don't
think
you
are
reading
the
statute
accurate.
it
says
in
words
it
may
be
brought
on
behalf
of
such
company.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
those
words
are
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
suit
be
pressing
a
company
right?
unknown
speaker
who
would
the
recovery--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
it
is
getting
something
for
nothing
that
it
doesn't
have
a
right
to?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
has
a
right
to
the
recovery
if
there
is
one.
unknown
speaker
so
the
suit
is
pressing
something
on
behalf
of
the
company.
unknown
speaker
maybe
not,
but
if
the
company
has
a
right,
they
may
not
be
able
to
sue
for
it,
but
if
it
has
a
right
against
the
advisor
and
the
shareholder
may
assert
that
right
on
behalf
of
the
company,
certainly
it
is
fairly
reasonable
to
say
that
a
suit
by
the
stockholder
is
one
on
behalf
of
the
company.
unknown
speaker
yes.
and,
you
could
certainly
argue
that
it
is
a
derivative
of
the
company
right.
it
depends
upon
the
company's
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
meyer,
may
i
interrupt
again?
i
don't
think
the
statute
says
the
words
"on
behalf
of"
don't
apply
to
the
action
by
the
commission.
there
is
a
comma
after
commission
and
then
you
have
the
whole
phrase,
whereby
a
security
holder
and
so
forth
on
behalf
of
the
company,
then
a
comma.
i
don't
think
the
"on
behalf
of"
language
applies
to
the
commission
action.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
meyer?
unknown
speaker
what
inference
do
you
ultimately
draw
from
your
different
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
meyer?
unknown
speaker
you
can
add
one
more
finally.
you
brought
this
complaint?
unknown
speaker
you
filed
this
complaint.
and,
you
named
the
daily
income
fund?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
money
market
fund?
unknown
speaker
and,
why
did
you
name
the
daily
income
fund.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
the
statute
say
you
shouldn't
maintain
an
action
against
anyone
except
the
recipient
of
the
payment?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
think...
do
you
think
the
fund
should
be
a
plaintiff
or
defendant
or
what?
could
it
be
realigned
as
a
plaintiff
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
in
ordinary
derivative
actions
the
failure
to,
if
there
has
been
a
failure,
to
go
to
the
board
to
comply
with,
rule
23
can
be
taken
advantage
of
and
asserted
by
a
third
party
who
sued?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
before
rule
23.1
comes
into
play,
it
assumes
that
the
corporation
or
association
has
failed
to
enforce
a
right?
unknown
speaker
you
say
in
this
case
the
fund
has
failed
to
exercise
a
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
says
had
it
failed.
unknown
speaker
assuming
we
disagreed
with
you
and
assuming
we
thought
that
there
was
no
right
in
the
firm
to
sue
under
section
36,
to
sue
the
advisor
under
36,
that
it
just
couldn't
exercise
any
right
under
the
statute
to
sue.
then
what
about
rule
23?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
you
have
a
right,
but
you
say...
but
the
rule
says
you
have
to
fail
to
enforce
it
and
so...
but,
if
you
have
no
right
to
enforce
the
right,
if
you
have
no
cause
of
action
to
enforce
the
right
under
the
statute,
what
then,
do
you
turn
to
state
law?
unknown
speaker
okay.
mr.
pollack,
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
second
of
your
two
responses
to
the
point
that
the
other
remedies,
that
the
directors
might
go
to
the
sec
or
they
might
be
shareholders
themselves.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
also
possible
your
response
to
the
latter
is
they
don't
have
to
be
shareholders
and,
of
course,
that
is
true,
but
would
it
not
also
be
conceivable,
if
they
thought
they
had
a
good
case
and
they
were
willing
to
finance
it
with
corporate
funds,
that
they
could
find
a
shareholder
and
assure
him
that
the
corporation
would
pay
the
expenses
of
litigation
even
though
the
corporation
couldn't
litigate
directly?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
ethical
problem
if
they
thought
there
was
a
clear
violation
and
that
the
corporation
would
benefit
from
the
action?
unknown
speaker
say
you
had
non-lawyer
directors.
all
directors
aren't
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
directors,
mr.
pollack,
concluded
shortly
after
the
suit
was
brought
that
maybe
there
was
quite
a
bit
to
it.
is
there
any
bar
that
you
know
of
to
having
the
directors
go
to
the
court
with
a
motion
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
and
be
dismissed
as
defendants?
i
am
talking
about
the
prudential
aspect.
it
perhaps
is
a
novel
motion,
but
any
bar
that
you
know
for
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
they
aren't
intervening
to
cut
it
off,
they
are
intervening
to
assert
the
corporation's
right
along
with
the
plaintiff,
whether
he
is
derivative
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
have
done
if...
you
represent
the
fund,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
the
fund
hadn't
been
named
at
all
as
a
defendant,
would
you
have
been
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
have
done,
intervened
or--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
here
just
representing
what
is
called
the
nominal
defendant
and
you
are
asserting
that
you
really
don't...
the
fund
really
doesn't
care
to
have
any
recovery
from
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
think
you
are
any
more
than
a
nominal
defendant
whatever
that
means?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
true,
but
the
company's
position
in
this
case...
the
only
possible
reason
for
it
being
a
defendant
or
being
a
party
at
all
is
so
it
is
in
the
case
to
receive
the
money
if
there
is
some
money.
unknown
speaker
they
can
receive
it
though--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it
you
participated
all
the
way
through
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
