mr.
richard
m.
meyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
choose
a
somewhat
different
starting
point
for
analyzing
this
case
than
that
chosen
by
my
adversary.
i
believe
the
starting
point
must
be
an
analysis
of
the
statute,
and
as
this
court
has
so
frequently
said,
the
starting
point
for
analyzing
a
statute
is
the
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
section
36(b),
which
was
enacted
after
years
of
consideration
and
study
by
the
congress,
expressly
provides
for
an
action
to
be
brought
by
any
security
holder
of
an
investment
company
or
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
no
mention
is
made
in
the
statute
of
a
right
on
behalf
of
the
investment
company
itself.
indeed,
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--the
words,
on
behalf
of
such
company,
do
not,
i
suggest,
imply
that
that
means
that
the
company
itself
may
bring
the
statute
nor
does
it
make
it
derivative.
for
example,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--the
words,
"on
behalf
of
the
investment
company.
"
are
in
the
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
not.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
the
recovery
would
go
to
the
company,
but
that
does
not
make
it
a
right--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--it--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--it
has
a
right
to
recovery,
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--the
suit
seeks
recovery
on
behalf
of
the
company.
that
does
not
necessarily
mean,
and
i
suggest
in
the
context
not
only
of
the
statute
but
of
the
legislative
history,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
company
is
the
one
to
assert
that
right
in
the
federal
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
the
statute
indeed
says
that
the
suit
is
on
behalf
of
the
company.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
well,
the
statute
also
says
that
the
suit
that
may
be
brought
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
on
behalf
of
the
company.
the
recovery
will
go
to
the
company.
i
don't
think
that
anyone
would
seriously
argue
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
enforcing
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
as
enunciated
in
this
statute
would
be
obliged
to
make
a
demand
upon
the
directors
of
the
company
before
it
were
permitted
to
proceed
with
an
action
to
vindicate
the
public
interest.
and,
i
suggest--
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
--well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
has
been,
to
my
knowledge,
one
action
brought
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
pursuant
to
the
statute
in
which
the
commission
did
recover
and
the
recovery
went
to
the
investment
company.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
and,
i
can't
visualize
any
other
type
of
result.
it
certainly
wouldn't
go
into
the
united
states
treasury.
i
think,
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
that
mr.
pollack
stated
that
the
principal
purpose
of
section
36(b)
was
to
strengthen
the
role
of
the
independent
directors.
i
believe
that
is
not
at
all
the
case.
the
legislative
history
contains
repeated
references
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
independent
directors.
it
contains
repeated
references
to
the
desire
of
congress
to
entrust
the
enforcement
of
rights
against
investment
advisors
to
security
holders,
not
just
shareholders,
but
all
security
holders,
and
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
references
to
the
fact
that
advisory
fees
by
investment
advisors
to
mutual
funds
and
other
investment
companies
had
been
excessive.
the
legislative
history
repeatedly
asserts
that
not
only
have
the
directives
been
ineffective
in
reducing
these
fees,
but
also
the
so-called
disclosure
requirements
under
the
act
have
been
ineffective
and
the
asserted
competition
which
the
investment
company
institute
maintained
was
effective
was
indeed
no
effective
in
reducing
advisory
fees
under
the
act.
now,
what
did
congress
provide
with
respect
to
this
rather
important
function
that
my
adversary
assigns
to
the
strengthening
of
directives?
it
did
essentially
three
things.
it
broadened
the
definition
of
affiliated
directors,
changed
the
terminology
to
call
them
interested
directors,
and
expanded
the
definition
of
who
would
be
an
interested
director
to
include,
for
example,
a
member
of
the
immediate
family
of
someone
on
the
investment
advisor,
to
include
someone
who
had
a
substantial
financial
relationship
with
the
investment
advisor
such
as
counsel,
general
counsel
to
the
investment
advisor.
i
submit
that
is
hardly
a
major
legislative
move.
the
other
areas
in
which
they
acted
to
strengthen
the
role
of
the
independent
directors
consisted
of
a
provision
providing
that
in
evaluating
the
advisory
contract
the
affiliated
directors
must
provide
and
the
unaffiliated
directors
must
receive
such
information
as
would
be
sufficient
in
order
to
pass
upon
the
investment
advisory
contract.
i
submit
that
that
is
hardly
an
extension
over
the
pre-existing
law.
the
second
circuit
had
held
in...
i
believe
it
was
in
1961
in
brown
versus
bullock
that
the
approval
of
an
advisory
contract
must
not
be
merely
formal
but
must
evidence
a
substantive
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
directors.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
the
inference
that
i
draw
from
my
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendment
was
that
this
was
a
concerted
effort
extending
over
a
period
of
years
beginning
as
early
as
1958
when
the
wharton
study
was
commissioned
by
the
sec
under
the
egis
of
congress
and
continuing
right
up
to
1970.
there
were
intermediate
reports
by
the
sec,
a
special
study
in
1963,
the
public
policy
report
in
1966,
all
of
which
went
to
the
proposition
that
there
must
be
effective
means
for
the
federal
courts
to
pass
upon
the
propriety
of
advisory
fee
compensation
in
the
investment
company
field
and
that
those
effective
means
were
not
being
provided
by
the
independent
directors
and
could
not
in
the
nature
of
things
be
provided
by
the
independent
directors
and
that
stockholder
and
sec
action
was
required
to
do
that.
let
me
add
to
that
one
important
reason
why
this
is
so
in
the
investment
company
field
as
distinguished
from
the
corporate
area
generally.
congress
was
faced
with
an
existing
situation
where
the
vast
majority
of
investment
companies
were
managed
not
by
their
own
internal
staffs
but
by
external
investment
advisors.
they
were
extremely
dependent
upon
these
external
investment
advisors
because
these
people
had
sponsored
the
fund,
they
sold
shares
of
the
fund,
and
there
was
no
practical
way
for
the
directors,
as
independent
as
they
might
be,
to
negotiate
meaningfully
with
them.
congress
decided,
and
they
did
have
an
alternative,
they
could
have
prohibited
external
investment
advisors.
they
chose
to
stay
with
the
existing
system.
but,
in
doing
so,
they
said
we
must
take
effective
means
to
ensure
that
this
conflict
of
interest
which
is
built
in
by
the
very
structure
must
have
a
check
and
balance
and
that
check
and
balance
is
an
action
by
the
security
holder
and
by
the
sec
which
will
be
ultimately
passed
upon
by
the
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
point
raised
in
petitioners'
reply
brief
on
page
one.
it
was
also
a
point
that
the
first
circuit
raised
and
that
is
that
if
a
new
board
of
directors
comes
in
and
decides
to
bring
an
action
against
an
expelled
investment
advisory,
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
they
would
be
powerless
to
do
so
under
the
statute.
i
would
suggest
there
are
three
answers
to
that.
the
first
answer
i
have
already
gone
into
in
some
length
and
that
is
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
congressional
intent.
never
in
all
of
the
years
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
1970
amendment
nor
in
the
years
since
has
a
board
of
directors
of
an
investment
company
brought
an
action
for
excessive
advisory
fees
against
its
investment
advisor.
this
fact
was
called
to
congress'
attention
during
the
legislative
history.
they
could
not
possibly
have
conceived
that
this
was
a
realistic
possibility
in
enacting
the
statute
and
when
the
statute
is
interpreted
it
must
be
interpreted
against
the
background
of
what
congress
assumed
to
be,
and
rightfully
so,
the
likely
situation;
where
directors
of
a
mutual
company
are
the
very
ones
who
have
approved
the
contract
that
is
in
issue,
and,
therefore,
it
becomes
a
functionless
act
to
demand
them
to
bring
suit
against
the
advisor
on
a
contract
that
they
have
already
determined
presumably
to
be
fair
and
adequate.
if,
however,
there
should
be
such
a
change
in
management
and
a
change
in
heart
that
the
directors
of
the
investment
company
decide
that
something
must
be
done
about
the
old
investment
advisor
who
is
no
longer
there,
they
still
have
two
additional
remedies.
number
one,
they
could
request
the
sec
to
bring
an
action.
and,
i
would
think
that
the...
it
could
not
be
lightly
assumed
that
the
sec
in
the
exercise
of
its
statutory
functions
would
be
derelict
if
the
directors
did,
in
fact,
have
sufficient
reason
to
make
that
type
of
request.
finally,
i
think
that
in
virtually
every
case,
and
certainly
in
the
present
case,
the
so-called
non-interested
directors
are
usually
shareholders.
in
this
case,
they
are
all
shareholders
of
the
fund.
so,
they
could
bring
an
action
as
a
shareholder,
just
as
mr.
fox
brought
the
action
in
this
case.
they
are
not
powerless.
they
can
act
through
the
means
that
we
have
suggested.
finally,
i
would
like
to
stress
the
point
that
although
we
claim
that
the
investment
company
does
not
itself
have
a
right
of
action,
and,
therefore,
under
rule
23.1,
which
requires
merely
that
an
allegation
be
made
concerning
demand
where
a
corporation
has
a
right
which
it
fails
to
assert.
in
addition
to
that
we
also
argue
that
even
if
the
investment
company
does
have
a
right
of
action
that
the
intent
of
congress
and,
indeed,
the
language
of
this
court
in
burks
against
lasker
suggests
that
there
need
be
no
demand
upon
the
directors
to
bring
the
action.
my
adversary
refers
to
the
statement
in
burks
against
lasker
as
dictum.
he
refers
to
the
statement
as
applying
merely
to
a
termination
case.
now,
the
actual
language
which
this
court
used
and
while
there
were
two
separate
concurring
opinions,
there
were
no
dissents,
so
that
the
decision
was
unanimous.
the
language
that
this
court
used
was
to
the
effect
that
when
congress
decided
to
prevent
directorial
action
from
cutting
off,
and
those
are
the
words
that
are
used,
cutting
off
shareholder
actions,
it
knew
how
to
do
so
and
it
did
so
in
section
36(b).
and,
by
way
of
analogy,
the
court
cited
in
a
footnote,
section
16(b)
of
the
1934
act,
stating
that
this
act
permits
shareholder
action
notwithstanding
the
decision
of
the
directors
not
to
bring
suit.
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
that
dispensing
with
a
demand
requirement
would
result
in
the
bringing
of
unwarranted
strike
suits,
this
was
an
issue
that
was
raised
before
congress.
congress
chose
not
to
be
swayed
by
that
argument
and,
indeed,
i
think
that
the
demand
requirement
really
has
little,
if
anything,
to
do
with
the
so-called
strike
suit.
the
demand
requirement
is
over
100
years
old.
it
can
be
traced
back
to
hawes
versus
oakland.
the
abuses
arising
out
of
shareholder
litigation
arose
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
and
they
were
remedied
or
attempted
to
be
remedied
by
the
most
part
by
providing
for...
providing
that
no
corporate
action
could
be
dismissed,
no
derivative
action
could
be
dismissed
absent
notice
to
shareholders
and
court
approval.
those
were
the
methods
that
were
sought
to
be
used
to
counter
the
so-called
strike
suits.
i
submit
that
they
have
been
extremely
successful.
finally,
again,
although
i
have
said
several
finales
but
one
further
point
with
respect
to
this
so-called
distinction
between
termination
and
demand.
in
the
third
circuit
case,
weiss
versus
temp
fund,
judge
becker
was
trying
to
square
the
decision
in
that
case
with
the
earlier
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
lewis
versus
curtis
in
which
the
third
circuit
had
held
that
the
exact
same
standards
that
apply
to
termination
apply
to
demand.
judge
becker
said
that
he
agreed
with
lewis
versus
curtis
insofar
as
it
held
that,
but
said
judge
becker,
because
this
court
in
burks
against
lasker
applied
a
conclusive
presumption
to
what
he
regarded
as
a
termination
situation
and
because
the
two
situations
were
factual
situations
he
would
not
apply
an
equally
conclusive
presumption
to
the
demand
question.
now,
i
submit
that
given
that
the
two
situations
involved,
as
logic
compels
that
they
are
involved,
namely...
the
logic
that
i
am
referring
to
is
that
what
we
are
really
asking
here
is
what
is
the
function
of
the
board
of
directors?
it
is
to
exercise
a
business
judgment.
if
their
business
judgment
is
not
to
be
given
weight
in
a
termination
situation,
then
neither
should
it
be
given
weight
in
a
demand
situation.
and,
while
judge
becker
attempted
to
make
that
distinction
in
the
weiss
case,
i
suggest
that
it
really
doesn't
carry
very
much
water
and
should
be
rejected
by
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
yes,
i
did.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
that
is
the
fund,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
i
named
the
fund,
and
i
may
have
made
a
mistake,
but
i
named
the
fund
because
i
read
the
statute
as
reading
that
the
recovery
would
go
to
the
fund
and
that
the
judgment,
in
order
to
be
complete,
ought
to
include
the
beneficiary
of
the
judgment.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
well,
yes.
the
fund
is
a
nominal
defendant.
it
certainly...
we
are
not
asking
the
fund
to
pay
any
money.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
this
issue
has
arisen
many
times
in
derivative
actions
and
in
diversity
actions
as
well.
just
through
sheer
habit
and
the
length
of
time
in
which
these
suits
are
brought,
it
is
customary
to
name
them,
since
they
are
not
a
willing
plaintiff,
to
name
them
as
a
defendant,
but
i
think
that
is
purely
a
formal
matter.
mr.
richard
m.
meyer
that
is
quite
correct
and,
in
fact,
i
think
that
is
another
reason
why
it
is
apparent
that
no
such
requirement
was
intended
by
congress
in
this
case
because
by
virtue
of
the
statute
virtually
every
investment
company
has
a
majority
of
unaffiliated
directors
and
that
would
in
effect
nullify
the
statutory
purpose
behind
section
36(b),
which
was
to,
as
i
said
before,
give
shareholders
or
security
holders
indeed
and
the
sec
the
right
to
challenge
excessive
advisory
fees.
