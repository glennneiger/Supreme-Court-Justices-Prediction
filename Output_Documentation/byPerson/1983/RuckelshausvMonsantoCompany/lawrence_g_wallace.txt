mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
district
court
judgment
declaring
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
key
provisions
of
fifra,
the
federal
insecticide,
fungicide
and
rodenticide
act,
the
act
under
which
epa
regulates
the
marketing
and
use
of
what
are
now
known
collectively
as
pesticides,
although
at
one
time
in
the
federal
statutes
they
were
referred
to
as
economic
poisons.
under
fifra
an
epa
registration,
which
is
essentially
a
license,
is
required
in
order
to
market
a
pesticide,
and
in
determining
whether
to
issue
the
registration
epa
determines
whether
there
will
be
unreasonable
adverse
effects
on
the
environment,
and
makes
that
determination
partially
by
consideration
of
health
and
safety
test
data
which
is
either
submitted
by
the
applicant
or
cited
by
the
applicant.
the
provisions
struck
down
by
the
district
court
are
those
that
permit
epa
to
consider
the
health
and
safety
data
submitted
by
one
applicant
and
cited
by
a
subsequent
applicant
in
support
of
the
application
for
registration
by
the
subsequent
applicant,
while
requiring
that
subsequent
applicant,
if
the
registration
is
granted,
to
compensate
the
first
applicant
for
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
conducting
the
tests,
and
provisions
requiring
epa
to
disclose
this
health
and
safety
data
to
qualifying
members
of
the
public.
the
court
also
declared
unconstitutional
the
provisions
providing
for
a
scheme
of
compulsory
arbitration
if
the
two
applicants
are
unable
to
agree
or
the
terms
of
compensation,
but
the
parties
are
in
agreement
that
that
provision
was
not
ripe
for
review
by
the
district
court
for
reasons
stated
in
the
briefs,
and
i
won't
refer
further
to
that
aspect
of
the
case.
in
many
ways
this
decision
is
reminiscent
of
the
constitutional
litigation
of
the
1920's
and
the
1930's
and
again
three
terms
ago
in
the
surface
mining
act
cases.
in
striking
down
this
major
congressional
regulatory
effort,
the
district
court
articulated
its
holding
to
be
that
congress
had
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
interstate
commerce
obviously
is
substantially
affected
by
this
industry--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
probably
what
it
meant,
and
i
don't
intend
to
belabor
anything
else.
but
i
just
do
want
to
say
that
to
the
extent
that
this
reflected
what
is
discussed
in
the
opinion,
a
reevaluation
of
the
resolution
congress
made
of
the
competing
policy
considerations,
that
was
obviously
improper
under
this
court's
decision,
and
monsanto
does
not
here
try
to
defend
the
judgment
on
those
grounds.
but
it
is
pertinent
to
say
that
the
present
statute
evolved
through
a
repeated
process
of
amendment
in
which
congress
gave
detailed
consideration
to
some
of
the
problems
of
the
industry
that
seemed
to
move
the
district
court
to
reach
the
judgment
that
it
did,
as
well
as
to
advances
in
scientific
knowledge
about
problems
in
the
use
of
these
chemicals
on
the
health
and
environment,
and
as
well
as
its
own
experience
with
earlier
versions
of
the
statute,
which
it
concluded
were
having
some
undesirable
effects,
such
as
extending
periods
of
patent
monopoly
beyond
the
expirations
of
the
patent.
and
in
response
to
the
expenses
involved
in
research
and
innovation,
congress
included
a
number
of
provisions
in
the
statute,
including
a
protection
for
trade
secrets
as
defined
by
the
statute,
the
provision
for
compensation
for
the
second
user
of
data,
and
a
provision
for
exclusive
use
for
a
ten-year
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
not
be
released
to
the
public.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
part
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
would
be
used
by
epa
or
the
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
could
be
protected.
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
constitutional
impediment
to
the
disclosure
of
the
information
under
a
different
rule--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
we
are
taking
that
position,
and
let
me
get
to
that
question.
i
think
it
is
important
for
me
to
make
a
few
general
comments
about
trade
secrets
before
getting
to
the
specific
questions
involved
in
this
case.
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
trade
secret
can
qualify
as
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
taking
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
while
in
order
to
rule
for
us
the
court
need
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
in
any
circumstances
a
trade
secret
could
be
so
protected,
we
do
think
it's
highly
dubious
that
a
trade
secret
in
any
circumstances
should
qualify
as
property
under
the
taking
clause
or
that
that
should
be
the
focus
of
litigation
concerning
disclosure
of
trade
secrets.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
understand
that,
although
we
happen
to
think
that
that
was
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law.
but
that
certainly
would
not
be
dispositive
of
what
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
means,
regardless
of
how
missouri
might
want
to
define
it.
let
me
try
to
explain
the
reasons
why
the
court
should
be
hesitant--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
fifth
amendment...
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"property"
in
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law,
justice
o'connor,
rather
than
something
that
a
state
is
free
to
define.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
they
probably
would
be,
justice
powell.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
that's
what
i
am
attempting
to
do
here,
because
the
right
to
exclude
is
of
a
very
different
nature.
let
me,
if
i
can,
just
make
these
general
comments
about
trade
secrets.
in
the
kewanee
oil
case
in
this
court,
in
a
statement
that
was
not
disputed
by
any
other
opinion
in
the
court
and
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
holding,
justice
douglas,
joined
by
justice
prennar,
said
in
the
dissenting
opinion:
"a
trade
secret,
unlike
a
patent,
has
no
property
dimension.
"
and
then
he
quoted
from
the
court's
opinion
by
justice
holmes
in
du
pont
powder
company
v.
masland,
an
opinion
that
is
discussed
in
the
briefs
in
the
case.
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
additional
basis
for
this
statement.
in
the
first
place,
it
probably
has
come
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
restatement
provisions
referred
to
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
parties
here
are
not
from
the
restatement
of
property;
they're
from
the
restatement
of
torts,
the
1939
edition.
and
while
the
origins
of
trade
secret
law
and
protection
have
not
been
considered
to
be
property
origins
at
all,
in
fact
comment
a
of
the
pertinent
section
of
that
restatement,
757,
says:
"the
suggestion
that
one
has
a
right
to
exclude
others
from
the
use
of
his
trade
secret
because
he
has
a
right
of
property
in
the
idea
has
been
frequently
advanced
and
rejected.
"
"the
theory
that
has
prevailed
is
that
the
protection
is
afforded
only
by
a
general
duty
of
good
faith,
and
that
the
liability
rests
upon
breach
of
this
duty,
that
is,
breach
of
contract,
abuse
of
confidence,
or
impropriety
in
the
method
of
ascertaining
the
secret.
"
now,
it's
true,
as
the
briefs
point
out,
that
trade
secrets
have
certain
of
the
characteristics
of
property.
they
can
be
the
res
of
a
trust,
they
can
be
treated
as
property
for
purposes
of
certain
transactions
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
but
basically
the
law
of
trade
secrets
is
a
law
concerning
the
regulation
of
commercial
relations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
is,
justice
rehnquist.
but
it
was
this
particular
provision
of
the
restatement
that
the
district
court
was
relying
on,
and
if
i
may
just--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
can't
recall
the
court
specifically
saying
that.
usually
it
has
not
been
that
specific
about
whether
it
wasn't
property
or
whether
it
just
wasn't
a
taking
in
the
particular
circumstances,
although
the
court
came
pretty
close
to
that
in
a
very
closely
parallel
case,
the
corn
products
case,
in
which
it
rejected
a
property
claim
as
to
the
ingredients
of
the
syrup
that
were
required
to
be
placed
on
the
label
and
said
that
disclosure
to
the
public
of
what
it
is
that
you're
selling
is
not
something
that
can
be
recognized
as
property
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment.
but
i
can't
say
that
the
opinion
was
quite
that
explicit.
but
we
really
think
the
disclosure
is
covered
by
that
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
recognize
that
the
effect
of
holding
that
this
is
a
property
interest
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
would
be
that
missouri
would
have
to
freeze
its
own
law
with
respect
to
trade
secrets,
or
otherwise
a
change
in
the
law
would
be
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment,
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason
why
i'm
trying
to
explain
to
the
court
that
trade
secret
law
is
basically
a
law
of
evidentiary
privileges
rather
than
a
law
of
property,
which
is
qualified
by
additional
tort
duties.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course
it
does,
of
course
it
does.
it
can
be
sold
in
that
way,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
protection...
it
can
also
be
discovered
through
reverse
engineering
and
through
overcoming
the
qualifications
on
the
privilege
against
evidentiary
disclosure.
in
this
court's
opinion
in
federal
open
market
committee
against
merrill,
the
court
stated,
in
discussing
the
nature
of
trade
secret
law,
that
federal
courts
have
long
recognized
a
qualified
evidentiary
privilege
for
trade
secrets
and
other
confidential
commercial
information.
it's
a
form
of
protection
of
confidential
communications.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
compulsory
licensing
systems
have
been...
are
possibilities
under
the
patent
and
copyright
laws.
the
principal
distinction
of
trade
secrets
is
that
it
involves
suppression
of
information.
what
the
patent
law
provides
is
the
right
to
exclude
someone
from
making
or
using
your
invention
or
practicing
it,
but
you've
disclosed
the
invention
in
the
patent
application.
and
the
copyright
law
prohibits
plagiarism,
but
doesn't
suppress
the
information
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
a
price
for
copying
it.
but
the
information
is
available--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
one,
yes,
in
the
form
of
copying
it.
but
there
isn't
suppression
of
information
from
the
public.
the
information
is
disseminated
even
though
there
might
be
a
price
on
it,
in
that
sense.
but
the
court
has
never
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
places
as
premium
under
the
taking
clause
on
the
suppression
of
information
itself,
which
is
what
the
trade
secret
law
protects
in
the
form
of
a
qualified
evidentiary
privilege.
now,
there
are
many
instances
in
which
that
qualification
of
the
privilege
can
be
overcome
that
are
familiar
to
the
court.
there
can
be
grand
jury
subpoenas
of
business
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you're
not
wrong
that
it
does
depend
on
the
law
of
the
50
states.
we
have
contended
in
our
brief
that
the
district
court
misconstrued
missouri
law
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
ordinarily.
but
in
the
case
of
a
nationwide
statute,
where
the
district
court
is
relying
on
the
restatement
of
torts
which
has
been
adopted
in
many
states
and
where
many
other
courts
have
reached
a
contrary
conclusion
about
what
is
protected,
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
behind
the
district
court's
holding
with
respect
to
whether
a
scheme
that
congress
has
set
up
for
the
regulation
of
these
potentially
hazardous
chemicals
is
a
taking
of
property.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
there
is
not
a
difference
with
respect
to
pre-1978
data,
even
on
that
premise,
because
there
was
no
legitimate
expectation
that
the
duties
of
federal
officials
in
administering
a
federal
program
were
prescribed
by
missouri
law
or
by
the
law
of
any
other
state,
rather
than
by
federal
standards,
which
have
long
governed
the
duties
of
federal
officials
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
information
that
has
been
disclosed
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
understand,
but
not
every
possibility
of
a
change
in
the
law
constitutes
a
taking
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
law
of
evidentiary
privileges
could
be
changed
by
a
state
or
by
the
federal
courts
or
by
congress
without
it
resulting
in
a
taking
of
property,
even
though
someone
might
have
thought
that
he
had
an
accountant's
privilege,
for
example,
and
disclosed
certain
information
to
his
accountants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'd
like
to
if
i
may.
it's
because,
to
resurrect
another
old
formulation
from
constitutional
law,
if
there
were
ever
a
business
affected
with
the
public
interest,
where
there
is
need
to
anticipate
changes
in
federal
regulatory
rules
as
scientific
knowledge
and
the
needs
of
public
health
advance,
this
would
be
such
a
business.
there
are
provisions
in
the
federal
statute
for
rescinding
the
registration
of
a
particular
pesticide
altogether,
let
alone...
and
this
can
defeat
investment-based
expectations
in
plant
and
equipment.
and
yet,
if
there
are
findings
that
protection
of
the
environment
and
the
public
health
require
this,
it
nonetheless
can
occur,
even
though
the
expectations
may
have
arisen
before
the
particular
rescinding
provision.
if
a
company
is
dealing
in
a
business
of
this
kind,
it
has
to
anticipate
that
the
needs
of
the
public
health
can
affect
its
expectations
based
on
its
investments,
and
the
needs
for
disclosure
to
individuals,
and
particularly
to
physicians
who
might
have
to
treat
patients
and
to
groups
representing
those
who
are
exposed
in
unusual
and
concentrated
ways
to
these
chemicals,
are
something
that
the
company
had
to
anticipate
that
congress
might
give
further
recognition
to,
such
as
the
need
for
groups
such
as
unions
representing
agricultural
workers
or
workers
in
the
pesticide
factories
or
physicians
groups
to
learn
the
information
that
they
need
to
know
to
make
sure
that
epa
is
conducting
its
affairs
properly
and
that
the
hazards
that
these
people
are
exposed
to
can
be
properly
avoided
or
treated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statute
provides
that
that
disclosure
provision
does
not
affect
the
provision
with
respect
to
the
use
of
this
information
to
support
an
application
for
registration.
so
the
applicant
still
has
to
cite
to
the
data,
and
by
citing
to
the
data
puts
himself
in
the
position
of
promising
to
pay
compensation
for
a
part
of
the
cost
of
conducting
the
tests
and
securing
the
data.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view,
that
congress
could
have
simply
done
it
by
another
method,
saying
that
if
a
pesticide
has
already
been
recognized
as
fit
for
marketing
other
persons
who
are
able
to
duplicate
it,
because
it's
unpatented
and
they
have
figured
out
how
to
make
it,
don't
need
a
registration
in
order
to
sell
it.
but
they
did
it
in
this
form,
partially
as
a
convenient
way
to
impose
an
obligation
to
compensate
the
innovator
for
the
cost
of
his
testing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
a
parallel
in
the
sense
that
congress
is
providing
for
a
scheme
of
compensation
by
competitors
to
the
innovator
that
the
innovator
is
not
entitled
to
under
the
constitution
once
his
patent
has
expired,
so
that
the
innovator
is
actually
better
off
under
this
scheme
than
he
would
be
without
it.
and
if
it
had
been
written
the
other
way,
that
the
duplicator
didn't
need
a
registration
at
all,
the
innovator
could
still
say,
well,
in
effect
there's
an
implied
reliance
by
congress
or
by
epa
on
this
costly
testing
that
we
have
done,
and
the
nature
of
the
claim
i
think
would
then
stand
more
clearly
as
what
it
is
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
it,
which
is
not
so
much
a
taking
claim
as
an
equal
protection
claim,
that
i
have
been
required
to
do
this
costly
testing
whereas
someone
else
is
allowed
to
market
the
same
product
without
doing
the
costly
testing.
but
there's
a
rational
basis
for
the
distinction
when
in
the
one
instance
the
product
had
not
been
previously
established
to
be
safe
and
effective
for
marketing
and
in
the
other
instance
it
had.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
difference
is
there's
no
use
of
the
property
in
the
second
instance,
under
my
hypothetical
where
the
statute
doesn't
refer
to
any
use
of
the
data
by
the
second
applicant.
this
is
not
a
physical
invasion
similar
to
kaiser-aetna
at
all.
it
is
a
scheme
that
congress
has
set
up
in
order
to
compensate
innovators
for
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
innovation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
not
in
that
form...
there
have
been
other
suits
to
enjoin
the
enforcement--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--from
the
outset.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
an
exception
to
disclose
normally
protected
information,
if
that's
what
you're
adverting
to,
when
there
is
a
finding
that
the
needs
of
public
health
require
it.
that
happened
when
it
was
discovered
that
vinyl
chloride,
which
was
used
as
an
inert
ingredient
in
a
number
of
pesticides,
was
a
carcinogen
that
caused
liver
cancer,
and
there
was
a
disclosure
at
that
time
of
something
that
the
statute
prohibits
disclosure
of,
which
is
the
identity
of
inert
ingredients
in
the
pesticides.
the
disclosure
was
just
naming
which
ones
included
vinyl
chloride.
but
no
one
disputed
that.
the
manufacturer
simply
stopped
using
vinyl
chloride
immediately
because
they
obviously
were
concerned
about
product
liability.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although
it's
not
always
dispositive,
one
of
the
principal
indicia
of
whether
government
regulation
is
permissible
regulation
or
constitutes
a
taking
is
whether
it
applies
to
an
entire
category
of
persons
or
whether
it
singles
out
someone
for
special
treatment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
even
then,
it
may
not
be
a
taking.
but
this
is
archtypical
of
the
kind
of
adjustments
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
economic
life
that
reflect
a
change
in
the
law
that
affects
a
whole
category
of
persons,
and
monsanto's
benefits
as
well
as
burdens
have
been
adjusted.
it
finds
itself
on
both
sides
of
the
equation
under
the
new
rule
in
being
able
to
rely
in
its
own
applications
on
other
innovators'
data
and,
while
it
cannot
directly
apply
for
them,
in
possibly
being
able
to
learn
through
the
public
disclosure
provisions
about
testing
methods
of
its
own
competitors.
now,
the
court
has
several
times
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
this
operates,
this
kind
of
adjustment
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
economic
life
may
operate,
retrospectively
as
well
as
prospectively
does
not
mean
that
it's
constitutionally
prohibited.
that
was
specifically
at
issue
in
andrus
against
allard,
where
people
had
invested
in
eagle
feathers
and
could
no
longer
under
the
new
rule,
even
though
they
had
bought
them
prior
to
the
act,
could
no
longer
market
them.
their
chief
means
of
commercial
exploitation
was
taken
away
because
of
important
environmental
concerns
in
that
case.
here
the
rights
that
monsanto
has,
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
are
much
greater
in
value
than
the
rights
retained
by
the
owners
there.
usery
against
turner
elkhorn
mining
company
was
another
example
where
the
court
upheld
retrospective
imposition
of
very
great
financial
burdens.
and
even
in
a
case
like
corn
products
itself,
it's
not
realistic
to
think
that
the
corn
products
company,
after
all
of
its
investment
in
plant,
equipment
and
goodwill,
had
the
realistic
option
of
just
going
out
of
business
rather
than
putting
on
the
new
labeling
requirements.
it
doesn't
make
sense
rigidly
to
distinguish
between
retrospective
and
prospective
application
of
this
kind
of
regulatory
adjustment
of
the
burdens
and
benefits,
as
this
court
has
called
it.
in
the
absence
of
further
questions--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
that
the
most
difficult
hypotheticals
would
involve
expropriation
by
the
government
of
formulas
and
manufacturing
processes
that
are
needed
in
wartime
or
other
national
emergency
and
the
allowing
other
contractors,
for
example,
to
use
them
to
supply
the
equipment.
and
then
the
question
would
be
whether
the
taking
was
of
the
trade
secret
or
whether
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that's
involved
in
patent
infringement,
a
taking
of
the
end
product,
the
making
and
using
and
practicing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
perhaps
it
could
be,
since
it's
a
formula
that
the
company
chose
not
to
disclose
and
keep
to
itself.
i
can't
deny
that
it
might
be
recognized
as
a
trade
secret.
