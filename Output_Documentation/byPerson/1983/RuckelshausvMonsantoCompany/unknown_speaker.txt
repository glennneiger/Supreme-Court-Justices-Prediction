unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
don't
you
think
the
district
court
meant
that
congress
had
exceeded
its
powers
unless
it
wanted
to
pay
compensation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
before
1978
the
law
was
clear,
was
it
not,
that
none
of
the
information
supplied
by
a
registrant
would
be
released
to
anyone
else?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it
would
just
be
used
by
epa.
unknown
speaker
yes,
right.
now,
why
should
information
of
that
kind,
which
was
disclosed
before
1978,
not
continue
to
be
protected?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
take
the
position
that
it
isn't
even
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
district
court
thought
that
the
law,
the
state
law
in
missouri
created
a
property
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
district
court
is
right
about
what
the
missouri
state
law
is,
why
wouldn't
we
accept
that
and
say,
yes,
it
is
property?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
would
a
copyright
be
property,
or
patents?
unknown
speaker
you
address
a
distinction
between
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you
speak
of
the
law
of
trade
secrets
as
though
perhaps
there
was
one
fount
for
that
kind
of
law.
isn't
the
law
of
trade
secrets
derived
from
the
law
of
the
50
states
on
the
subject?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i
think
there's
perhaps
a
little
more
implied
in
this
question.
you
say
that
the
question
of
whether
something
is
property
for
the
takings
clause
purpose
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
but
can
you
recall
any
case
involving
the
takings
clause
where
this
court
has
said,
even
though
something
was
deemed
property
under
the
state
law,
we
deem
it
not
to
be
property?
unknown
speaker
just
a
minute.
if
you
start
out
as
an
initial
matter
by
saying
that
before
you
can
market
corn
products
under
the
laws
of
this
state
you
must
disclose
what
is
in
it,
that's
quite
a
different
question
from
saying
after
15
years
that,
although
you
disclosed
it,
we
won't
let
anybody
know,
to
say
that
as
of
now
we're
going
to
start
letting
everybody
know
what
we
earlier
said
we
wouldn't
let
anybody
know.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
it
has
a
market
value,
that
someone
can
sell
a
trade
secret
and
that
it
has
economic
value?
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest
a
possible
analogy,
hypothetical,
but
it's
been
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there's
a
federal
statute
that
provides
that
if
a
record
is
copyrighted
and
goes
on
the
market
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
may
make
copies
of
that
and
sell
them
simply
by
writing
a
letter
to
the
copyright
owner
saying,
i
am
copying
your
record,
and
then
you
pay
a
statutory
royalty.
now,
that's
been
upheld
at
least
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
how
do
you
distinguish
the
trade
secrets
in
this
context
from
that
compulsory
copyrighting
system?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
puts
a
price
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
price
for
using,
a
price
for
using
the
original
work.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you're
talking
again
as
if
there
were
some
uniform
body
of
law
on
trade
secrets.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
you
answered
my
earlier
question
that
the
law
of
trade
secrets
depends
on
the
law
of
the
50
states?
unknown
speaker
do
we
ordinarily
review
that
sort
of
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wallace,
let's
just
suppose
that
the
court
were
to
disagree
on
whether
we
are
bound
by
the
determination
of
state
law
and
were
to
find
that
the
trade
secrets
in
this
instance
constituted
property
under
the
taking
clause.
then
is
there
a
difference
in
the
pre-1978
data
because
at
that
point
there
was
no
expectation
at
all
that
it
would
be
released
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
those
standards
provided
before
1978
that
they
would
be
maintained
secret.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
it's
just
hard
to
understand
why
the
company
wouldn't
have
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
or
maintenance
of
secret
information
before
1978.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you...
i'm
sorry.
did
you
finish
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
don't
exactly
understand
how
the
compensation
provision
would
operate.
if
information
revealed
to
the
public
is
then
conveyed
by
the
public
generally,
through
say
a
trade
journal
survey,
you
end
up
with
ten
competing
companies--
unknown
speaker
--not
because
the
constitution
requires
it,
because
the
statute
does.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
parallel
here
with
the
mandatory
licensing
that
i
spoke
of?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
equally
well
argue
that
the
claims
in
cases
like
kaiser-aetna
should
have
been
equal
protection
claims.
the
person
who
owned
the
property
resented
having
to
share
his
property
with
nine
other
people
who
hadn't
paid
for
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
as
i
read
the
statute,
its
primary
provisions
really
are
a
rule
of
nondisclosure
of
trade
secrets,
but
then
there
are
a
couple
of
exceptions,
one
of
which
is
where
public
health
demands
it,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
as
i
also
understand,
there
are
relatively
few
applications.
there
are
not
thousands
and
thousands
of
these
things.
how
often
has
the
issue
actually
arisen
where
you
have
disclosed
something
publicly
that
monsanto
has
objected
to?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
has
there
been
any
specific
litigation
over
specific
disclosures--
unknown
speaker
--or
proposed
disclosures?
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph,
given
all
the
complexities,
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
if
you'd
tell
me,
give
me
a
specific
example
of
something
that's
been
taken,
or
when
the
taking
occurs
in
your
understanding.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
there
were
no
injunction.
when
would
the
first
taking
have
occurred?
was
it
on
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
the
disclosure?
what
is
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
taking
specifically
the
example
that
mr.
wallace
gave
us
just
a
minute
age.
was
that
a
taking
in
your
view
when
they
disclosed
the
inert
ingredient
in
the
vinyl
chloride?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
objected,
would
it
have
been
a
taking?
that
would
be
section
10(b)
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
assuming
it
was
a
trade
secret.
unknown
speaker
for
the
reasons
that
he
gave,
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
been
a
taking?
unknown
speaker
and
would
there
have
been
a
tucker
act
remedy
if
that
were
the
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
i'm
talking
under
the
statute
that
the
district
court
has
enjoined,
the
disclosure
provision
in
section
10(d).
unknown
speaker
my
question--
unknown
speaker
--back
to
three.
when
does
the
taking
occur?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
just
one
other
question.
in
your
view
does
the
taking
occur
when
there's
no
disclosure
but
another
competitor
is
permitted
to
cite
some
of
your
test
data?
unknown
speaker
so
you've
got
two
takings:
one,
when
someone
else
uses
without
disclosure;
and
two,
when
there's
a
disclosure.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
randolph,
are
you
arguing
that
the
pre-1978
submissions
are
taken
under
the
1978
amendments
and
also
the
post
data
submissions?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
bear
on
the
taking
issue?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
if
i
may.
you
said
earlier
that
you
didn't
distinguish
at
all
between
the
pre-1978
information
files
and
the
post...
1978.
i
would
think
that
the
corn
products
case
which
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
would
give
you
some
trouble
if
you
don't
make
any
such
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
if
you
would
address
the
question
i
asked
you
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is...
perhaps
i
should
rephrase
it.
how
do
you
distinguish
the
corn
products
case
as
to
the
post-1978
situation,
when
you're
on
notice
that
anything
that
you
file
in
order
to
assist
the
epa
to
evaluate
anything
is
subject
to
disclosure?
unknown
speaker
but
justice
pitney's
opinion
states
the
contention
of
the
parties
that
the
requirement
that
they
publish
the
ingredients
on
the
labels
amounted
to
a
taking
of
their
property.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
principle
is
a
lot
closer
than
that,
i
think.
what
if
the
federal
government
just
passed
a
simple
statute,
a
labeling
statute:
you
can't
sell
economic
poisons,
as
they
used
to
call
them,
without
disclosing
their
ingredients.
and
if
one
of
the
ingredients
is
an
inert
thing
that
would
previously
be
a
trade
secret,
you'd
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
without
having
a
label
on
it
that
discloses
all
its
ingredients,
even
though
some
of
them
may
be
trade
secrets
as
a
matter
of
missouri
law.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
mr.
randolph,
the
last
sentence
says
the
reason
is
to
protect
against
an
unreasonable
risk
of
injury
to
health
or
the
environment.
it's
the
same
sort
of
public
interest.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
that's
the
only
disclosure.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
this
is
the
only
kind
of
material
that
may
be
disclosed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph,
do
you
think
the
government
or
the
congress
could
condition
registration
on
the
applicant's
waiver
of
confidentiality?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
epa
provided
that
for
every
application
to
use
a
pesticide
there
shall
be
a
filing
fee
of
$25,000?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
can't
it
require
the
sacrifice
of
other
kinds
of
property
as
a
condition
for
filing
the
thing,
so
long
as
it
isn't
just
way
out
of
sight?
unknown
speaker
well,
monsanto
is
getting
federal
registration
for
a
product.
now,
i
suppose
it
could
just
decide
that
it
isn't
worth
it,
i'd
rather
not
register
it
and
sell
it
in
the
united
states,
i'll
stick
to
the
foreign
market
or
something.
having
made
the
decision
that
you
want
federal
registration,
why
can't
the
federal
government,
prospectively
at
least,
say
to
get
the
registration
you
have
to
disclose
this
information?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
give
up
property
if
you
pay
a
fee.
it's
just
no
different.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
in
a
zoning
case
that
a
city
can
say,
sure,
we'll
let
you
build
a
new
high
rise
apartment
provided
you
dedicate
a
street?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
this
court
held
that
some
entity
in
new
york
could
take
away
a
valuable
right
worth
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
from
the
penn
central
railroad
because
it
alone
among
a
very
few
buildings
could
not
build
a
high
rise
building
over
the
site
of
the
old
depot.
is
that
a
taking
that
was
any
less
offensive
than
the
present
one?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
are
you
any
better
off
than
penn
central?
that's
my
question.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical.
what
if
you
have
an
inventor
who
has
spent
20
years
trying
to
develop
an
invention
and
he's
on
the
verge
of
being
in
a
position
to
seek
a
patent
and
the
government
decides
to
change
the
patent
law
and
not
grant
patents
for
that
kind
of
thing
any
more?
does
he
have
a
claim
for
a
taking?
unknown
speaker
why
aren't
you
in
substantially
the
same
position
after
1978?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
it's
in
a
position
of
either
giving
a
registration
or
not.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
government
does
make
an
argument
here
that
this
is
not
property.
and
i
think
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
it's
a
good
deal
more
ephemeral
kind
of
property
than
the
real
property
in
your
example
of
the
town
parking
lot?
unknown
speaker
your
colleague
has
it
for
you,
mr.
randolph.
unknown
speaker
what
page
were
you--
unknown
speaker
like
singling
out
penn
central
for
special
treatment?
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
question.
suppose
this
material
that
was
filed
by
monsanto
contained
the
formula,
the
development
of
something
which
they
discovered
by
accident,
which
very
often
is
the
case,
and
they
point
out
that
its
only
utility
is
that
it
will,
if
it's
sprayed
on
grapes,
grape
vines,
it
will
destroy
them.
and
contingency
planners
in
the
pentagon
say,
well,
we
better
have
a
contingency
plan
in
case
we
get
into
a
war
with
france,
which
isn't
very
likely,
but
let's
have
contingency
plan
where
we
can
destroy
their
economy
by
spraying
the
stuff,
and
so
we
want
this
formula.
do
they
have
to
pay
for
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
this
was
a
trade
secret,
this
hypothetical
i
mentioned?
