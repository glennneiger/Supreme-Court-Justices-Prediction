mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
many
respects
this
is
an
exceedingly
complicated
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
subject
matter,
pesticides,
which
is
highly
technical,
scientific,
fully
understood
i
think
only
by
the
members
of
the
scientific
community
that
deal
in
it.
and
we're
dealing
also
with
research
and
test
data
that
contains
trade
secrets.
some
of
the
registrations
may
consume
100
volumes
or
more,
10,000
pages
dealing
with
such
subjects
as
metabolism,
residue,
methods
of
analysis,
scientific
protocols,
toxicology
studies,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
the
statute
that's
involved
in
this
case,
the
federal
insecticide,
fungicide
and
rodenticide
act,
is
not
only
difficult
to
pronounce
but
difficult
to
understand.
it's
arcane,
esoteric,
not
highly
readable.
and
on
top
of
all
this
we
have
the
fifth
amendment
taking
clause
which,
as
the
court
said
in
the
penn
central
case,
after
two
centuries
of
adjudication,
it's
been
difficult
to
formulate
any
set,
clear
concrete
standard
with
respect
to
its
application.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
have
an
injunction,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
the
injunction
has
prevented
epa--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--well,
with
respect
to
disclosure,
we
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
a
taking
until
the
information
was
disclosed,
so
long
as
epa
retained
possession
of
it
and
did
not
disclose
it,
as
was
the
situation
prior
to
1978,
when
indeed
there
was
a
federal
criminal
statute
that--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
i
believe
the
companies
consented
to
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
have
been
a
trade
secret.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
if
it
were
disclosed
with
the
objections--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
there
would
have
been
compensation
that
would
have
to
be
paid.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
are
we
talking
now
in
terms
of
the
1978
amendments
or
pre-'78?
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
let
me
state
my
position
clearly:
one,
we
believe
trade
secrets
are
contained
in
the
material
that
has
been
submitted
by
monsanto
to
epa.
two,
we
believe
they
are
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
three,
we
think
that
the
statute
in
question
here,
the
disclosure
provisions,
the
use
provisions,
take
that
property
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
four,
we
don't
believe
that
we
have
a
tucker
act
remedy
in
this
statute.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
if
it's
with
respect
to
disclosure,
it
would
be
upon
the
disclosure.
a
trade
secret,
it's
not
only
the
law
but
it's
also
common
sense,
it's
no
longer
there
if
it's
no
longer
a
secret.
if
it's
released
to
the
world,
monsanto
could
hardly
sell
it
to
anyone
because
everyone
knows
the
process.
and
that
is
our
position,
but
i'd
like
to
start
out
if
i
may--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes,
because
we've
lost
our
right
to
exclude
at
that
point.
it's
rather
like--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes,
but
there
will
always
be
disclosure
preceding
use,
because
the
information,
once
it
gets
filed,
is
available
for
release
30
days
after
the
registration.
it
would
then
follow
that
once
it's
available
and
out
in
the
public
that
other
competitors
may
seek
to
share
the
information.
they
may
use
it,
by
the
way,
in
ways
that
monsanto
would
never
be
compensated
for
under
fifra.
for
example,
the
methodology,
the
detection
techniques.
there's
evidence
in
the
record
here
with
respect
to
radio
labeling
of
molecules
and
detection
of
molecules
and
how
to
deal
with
metabolism
studies,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
if
a
competitor
of
monsanto,
or
anyone
for
that
matter,
went
and
took
that
information,
which
has
taken
years
and
millions
of
dollars
for
monsanto
to
develop,
and
did
not
seek
when
it
registered
a
product
to
do
it
on
the
heels
of
monsanto's
product
and
register
the
same
kind
of
product,
but
to
take
a
different
product,
then
monsanto
would
not
be
compensated
under
the
statute.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
yes,
we
draw
no
distinction
between
the
two.
with
respect
to
monsanto
company,
let
me
explain
why.
the
company's
development
of
pesticides
has
been
detailed
somewhat
in
the
brief
and
i'd
like
to
maybe
go
through
that
and
explain
exactly
what
we're
talking
about
with
respect
to
research
and
test
data
and
registration
of
pesticides.
the
record
indicates
quite
clearly
that
the
development
of
pesticides
is
a
risk-laden
business,
one
that
takes
years
and
years
to
get
going,
let
alone
to
be
successful
in.
many
major
corporations
have
dropped
out
of
the
business...
exxon,
clin,
a
number
of
others,
cities
service.
the
company
must
make
a
commitment
years
and
years
before
it
gets
to
the
point
where
it
registers
a
product
and
ultimately
recaptures
its
investment.
monsanto
company,
the
evidence
also
shows,
has
been
in
the
pesticide
business
since
1948.
the
agricultural
products
division
did
not
really
begin
turning
a
profit
until
the
late
1960's,
mid-1960's,
somewhere
in
that
range.
even
with
all
these
risks
that
the
company
goes
through
and
everything
else
that's
involved,
the
company
is
now,
again
the
record
shows,
baking
about
a
five
percent
return
on
its
investment.
but
in
making
all
of
these
tremendous
commitments
of
resources,
the
company,
monsanto,
has
developed
one
thing,
and
i
think
i
can
state
it
graphically.
it
has
been
able
to
find
a
new
pesticide,
a
new
active
ingredient,
at
the
rate
of
one
out
of
every
10,000
chemical
compounds
that
it
invents
or
discovers.
that
sounds
like
an
extraordinarily
low
average.
in
fact,
it's
twice
as
good
as
the
rest
of
the
industry
is
doing.
within
the
material
that
epa
wishes
to
disclose
are
the
secret
techniques
and
methods
that
monsanto,
after
17,
20
years,
has
used
to
start
developing
these
new
pesticides.
nevertheless,
the
last
new
chemical
compound
used
as
an
active
ingredient
for
pesticide
that
monsanto
has
been
able
to
discover
was
discovered
and
registered
in
1975.
all
of
the
registrations
that
have
come
since
then
have
been
for
expanded
uses
of
this
latest
pesticide,
which
is
called
roundup,
uses
in
areas
other
that
the
initial
registration,
which
may
have
been
for
one
particular
crop,
it
may
have
been
one
particular
type
of
application,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
as
monsanto's
research
goes
forward,
they
find
different
ways
to
use
the
same
product.
now,
we
claim
in
this
case
that
the
trade
secrets
are
property.
there
is
a
fundamental
disagreement
between
monsanto
and
the
epa
in
this
case,
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
following.
epa
has
said
throughout
its
brief
and
again
in
oral
argument
that
congress
has
created
a
good
statutory
scheme
here,
spent
years
developing
and
considering
the
various
sides
of
the
issue,
and
it
had
the
right
to
reach
the
objective
that
it
did,
namely
public
disclosure
and
use.
and
i
might
add
as
a
parenthetical
that
i
have
combed
the
committee
reports
and
the
only
thing
that
the
court
will
find
when
it
examines
in
regard
to
why
congress
passed
the
disclosure
statute
are
about
three
lines
cited
in
the
government's
brief
that
say
the
public
right
to
know.
you
will
find
nothing
beyond
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
it
doesn't,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
i'll
explain
why.
the
commerce
clause
which
gives
congress
the
right
to
pass
this
statute
deals
with
ends,
ways
of
accomplishing...
the
objectives.
the
fifth
amendment
deals
with
means.
the
fifth
amendment
says
that,
although
the
end
may
be
proper,
the
public
use,
you
cannot
do
it
in
a
certain
way,
and
the
certain
way
that
you
cannot
do
it
is
by
taking
somebody's
private
property
without
paying
then
for
it.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
the
corn
products
case...
i
don't
make
a
distinction.
the
government
says,
and
i
heard
it
again
here
today,
that
the
reason
there
should
be
a
distinction
is
because
beyond
1978
we
had,
monsanto
had,
no
"investment-backed
expectations".
i'd
like
to
address
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
if
i
may,
i
think
you've
asked
two
questions.
i'd
like
to
answer
then
both.
one,
the
corn
products
case
is
a
labeling
case.
justice
pitney's
opinion
has
one
paragraph
that
talks
about
misbranding
and
the
state's
right
to
control
it.
it
was
a
state
case,
it
was
a
state
regulation.
the
court
has
said...
justice
rehnguist,
indeed,
you
wrote,
the
opinion
in
the
pruneyard
case...
that
the
states
have
more
authority
to
define
what
is
property
than
the
federal
government.
in
fact,
i
think
the
court
said
that
the
federal
government
has
no
authority
to
define
what
is
property
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
agree.
one
way
of
looking
at
the
corn
products
case
is
that
the
state
was
defining
what
was
property
in
that
situation.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
but
it
was
a
state
regulation,
and
the
state
in
that
sense
is
redefining
what
the
person's
property,
what
the
company's
property
right
was
with
respect
to
trade
secret
protection.
two,
in
the
taking
area
the
court
has
always
made
an
exception...
and
i
believe
again
in
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
the
penn
central
case
the
court
talks
about
this
or
the
dissenters
talk
about
it...
for
noxious
use
cases.
corn
products
was
a
mislabeling,
misbranding,
adulteration
case,
and
the
state
made
a
judgment
that
if
the
product
was
not
properly
labeled
then
it
would
be
considered
adulterated
and
misbranded,
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
opinion
went
off.
this
is
not
a
labeling
case.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
label,
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
see
how
150
volumes
containing
10,000
pages
of
research
and
test
data
filled
with
monsanto's
trade
secrets
could
be
attached
to
every
can
of
roundup.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
you
cannot
sell
without
disclosing--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--i
would
say
that's
unconstitutional
today.
there's
no
indication,
i
want
to
be
clear,
in
the
legislative
history
that
any
provision
here
that's
involved
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
misbranding,
adulterated
products.
in
fact,
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
here
is
that
every--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--the
disclosure,
justice
stevens,
here--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--comes
after
the
epa
has
passed
upon
the
data
and
registered
the
product
and
it
is
being
sold.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
several
reasons.
one,
we
don't
think
that,
and
we
don't
believe
the
court
has
ever
held,
that
the
relinquishment
of
private
property
can
be
a
condition
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce,
because
once
the
court
holds
that
then
we
have
no
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government's
capacity
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
is
almost
unbounded.
the
court
has
made
clear,
i
believe,
in
the
security
industrial
bank
case,
in
the
kaiser-aetna
case,
that
the
fifth
amendment
question
does
not
depend
upon
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
reach
the
objective
that
was
sought.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
believe
it
could
do
that.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
it
is
way...
there
is
no
relationship
between
disclosure
here
and
compensation
to
monsanto.
monsanto
is
not
getting
any
compensation
for
disclosure,
so
in
that
sense
it
is
out
of
sight.
second
of
all--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--because
if
it
is,
if
it
is
the
basis
for
requiring
companies
to
give
up
property,
then
there
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
taking
clause,
and
i'll
explain
why.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
you're
relinquishing
private
property.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
saying,
for
example,
to
general
motors,
and
i'll
talk
in
terms
of
real
property,
that
in
order
to
sell
cars
in
the
united
states
you
must
give
up
five
manufacturing
plants,
or
in
order
to
sell
cars
in
the
united
states
you
have
to
pay
a
fee
of
x
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
the
department
of
transportation.
there's
a
difference
because--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--yes.
they're
not
taking
property
then.
what
they're
doing
in
that
area,
they're
not
destroying
property,
they're
not
requiring
the
owner
to
give
up
the
property;
they're
restricting
the
way
that
the
owner
uses
the
property.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
we
are
losing
the
property
that
we
have.
the
disclosure
of
trade
secrets
destroys
the
property.
it
is
being
transferred
into...
what
was
a
trade
secret
at
monsanto
if
this
statute
is
allowed
to
go
into
effect
will
become
not
a
piece
of
property
any
more,
but
public
information.
it
is
no
different
than
if
the
federal
government
ordered
monsanto
to
open
up
its
plant
and
its
research
facilities,
conduct
research
in
the
sunshine,
and
allow
the
public
to
walk
through
and
pluck
out
whatever
trade
secrets
they
seem
to
want
at
the
moment.
that
is
what
this
statute
does.
so
we
are
losing
cur
property,
and
once
it's
gone
we'll
never
get
it
back.
and
we're
losing
it
in
a
way
that
we
think
the
court
has
held
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits,
and
that
is
by
destroying
our
right
to
exclude.
we
don't
have
a
right,
monsanto
doesn't
have
a
right
to
prevent
someone
else
independently
from
discovering
the
methods
that
it's
taken
30
years
to
develop.
but
what
we
do
have
a
right
is
to
exclude
others
from
just
coming
in
and
taking
them
away.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
court
held
it
wasn't
a
taking.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
certainly
here
so.
[laughter]
the
penn
central
case
can
be,
i
think,
distinguished
on
a
number
of
different
grounds,
one
of
which
was
that
penn
central
entered
into
its
contracts
to
build
over
the
grand
central
station
after
the
preservation
law
went
into
effect,
and
the
court
relied
on
the
investment-backed
expectations
point.
and
i'd
like
to
distinguish
our
case
on
that
basis.
monsanto
has
been
engaging
in
the
pesticide
industry
since
1948.
it
has
assembled
a
team
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
scientists.
it
has
spent
a
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars
just
in
developing,
not
the
research
and
testing,
just
in
developing
the
ten
herbicides
that
form
the
backbone
of
the
company
at
the
moment.
fifra
didn't
create
the
pesticide
industry
and
didn't
spur
monsanto
on.
what
spurred
monsanto
on
was
the
need
in
agriculture
and
ultimately
the
need
of
the
public
for
food.
there
are
30,000
different
species
of
weeds
in
the
world.
there's
100,000
different
species
or
types
of
diseases.
there's
10,000
different
species
of
plant-eating
insects.
one-third
of
the
world's
food
population
is
destroyed
by
pests
every
year.
$20
million
is
lost
in
the
united
states
even
with
the
pesticides
that
are
in
place
now.
that
is
what
spurred
monsanto
on.
that
is
where
it
relied
upon
to
invest
all
the
money
that
it
did,
take
all
the
risks
that
it
did,
develop
all
the
trade
secrets
that
it
has,
and
to
keep
the
company
going.
so
when,
on
top
of
this
long-term
commitment...
and
it
is
a
long
term.
the
record
shows
that
it
may
take
14
to
22
years
from
the
moment
that
the
scientists
identify
a
problem
and
begin
synthesizing
chemicals,
it
may
take
14
to
22
years
for
the
company
to
break
even,
to
break
even,
to
get
a
return,
start
getting
a
return
or
profit.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
he
would
have
property,
though.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
in
the
situation
you
describe,
the
inventor
still
would
have
property
because
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
trade
secret.
he
would
not
have
the
monopoly
that
would
go
with
it,
though,
because
the
government
gave
it
to
him,
the
government
can
take
away.
the
government,
the
federal
government
can
take
it
away.
the
government,
the
federal
government,
epa,
did
not
give
monsanto
its
trade
secrets.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
was
going
to
address
that.
i'm
sorry,
i
think
i
got
sidetracked
on
the
point.
if
it
is
a
requirement
that
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
property
owners
must
give
up
their
property,
my
point
was
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
emasculated.
the
framers
when
they
developed
the
fifth
amendment
wanted
to
put
a
restraint
on
the
government.
it
is
not
congress'
choice
to
balance
a
private
property
right
against
the
public
interest,
and
that
is
essentially
what
the
government
is
arguing.
the
fifth
amendment
says:
"private
property
shall
not
be
taken
for
private
use
without
just
compensation.
"
once
the
court
accepts
the
notion...
and
it
has
never
accepted
the
notion...
that
you
should
balance,
as
the
government
invites
the
court
to
do,
then
private
property
is
gone.
it's
difficult
to
think...
for
example,
if
that
were
the
rule,
and
it
is
not,
an
individual
in
a
town
that
has
a
parking
lot
that
the
town
needs
for
a
school...
whose
public
interest
should
prevail
there?
how
does
one
weigh
it?
almost
by
definition,
the
public
right,
the
public
need
will
supersede
the
private
use.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
i
use
that
as
a
concrete
example
and
to
try
not
to
get
into
that.
but
i'd
like
to
address
the
question
of
whether
this
is
property.
the
federal
government
does
not
define
what
is
property.
the
fifth
amendment
defines
it.
and
the
court
has
held
in
cases
such
as
the
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies
case,
which
relied
upon
ross,
that
property
is
a
broad
and
majestic
term,
and
in
fact
i
think
there
was
one
case
where
the
court
said
that
it
would
denigrate
it
to
say
that
property
can
be
a
horse
trainer's
license,
but
not
the
right
to
bring
an
action
for
discrimination.
but
what
it
consists
of
is
this:
existing
rules
and
understandings
derived
from
an
independent
source,
and
the
independent
source
generally
is
state
law.
we
have
cited
case
after
case
from
around
the
country
dealing
with
state
courts
holding
this
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
particular
case
involved.
we've
also
cited
the
internal
revenue
service:
when
you
sell
a
trade
secret,
treat
it
as
a
capital
gain
or
a
capital
loss,
because
it
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
has
been
for
a
long
time.
and
i
might
also
say
that
the
court
in
kewanee,
in
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
on
two
separate
occasions,
i
believe
page
479
and
page
483
of
the
opinion,
called
trade
secrets
property.
and
the
department
of
justice
itself,
which
is
now
here
representing
epa,
told
congress
in
1967...
i
want
to
quote
this...
that
trade
secrets
were
in
fact
property.
i
can't
seem
to
find
it
now.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
think
this
states
monsanto's
position
better
perhaps
than
we
have.
the
department
of
justice,
the
attorney
general,
said
to
congress
in
1967
that:
"formulae,
designs,
drawings,
research
data,
et
cetera,
which
although
set
forth
on
pieces
of
paper
are
significant
not
as
records
but
as
items
of
valuable
property--
"
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
page
20
of
our
brief.
the
point
here
is
that
the
existing
rules
and
understandings
not
only
are
derived
from
state
law;
they're
within
the
federal
government
itself
and,
i
might
add,
within
congress
as
well.
congress
could
not
help
but
to
operate
within
the
framework
of
those
rules.
and
we
have
cited
from
the
legislative
history,
congress
talked
about
the
continuing
proprietary
interest
of
data
submitters
like
monsanto.
they
talked
in
terms
and
they
legislated
on
the
basis
that
the
companies
retained
legal
ownership
of
the
data.
in
fact,
epa
told
congress
that
the
data
itself
has
a
"continuing
commercial
value
beyond
the
value
that
is
used
for
achieving
registration.
"
it
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
every
standard
the
court
has
ever
set
down,
and
congress
knew
full
well
that
it
was
taking
it
away
and
it
provided
for
compensation.
why
else
would
congress
provide
for
compensation
except
to
compensate
the
owner
for
something
he's
lost?
compensation
for
use,
but
for
disclosure
it
set
against
an
abstraction,
the
public
right
to
know,
against
monsanto's
property
rights.
the
public
right
to
know
is
not
set
forth
in
the
constitution.
one
can
search
the
constitution
in
vain.
that's
simply
another
way
of
saying
congress
has
decided
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
in
a
certain
way.
what
is
that
way?
public
disclosure,
and
we
believe
that
public
disclosure
takes
monsanto's
property,
destroys
it,
and
turns
it
into
public
information
or
a
public
library,
and
in
doing
that
has
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
