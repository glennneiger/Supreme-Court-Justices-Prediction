unknown
speaker
what
exactly
are
the
cross
bars,
mr.
alperin?
unknown
speaker
is
any
of
this
in
private
property,
mr.
alperin?
unknown
speaker
you
say
some
of
it.
much
of
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
there
is
for
first
amendment
purposes
any
difference
between
a
prohibition
against
hanging
signs
from
privately
owned
wires
and
publicly
owned?
unknown
speaker
in
the
particular
election
that
was
involved
here
how
many
candidates
were
there
for
all
the
public
offices
on
that
election
date?
have
you
any
idea?
does
the
record
show
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alperin,
following
through
on
justice
rehnquist's
question,
at
pages
136
and
137
of
the
appendix
are
those
photographs
of
cross
wires?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
affect
the
safety
of
the
workers
involved?
those
cross
bars
are
there
in
any
event
are
they
not?
the
worker
is
not
going
to
get
out
of--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
people
interested
in
proposition
10...
i
take
it
that
is
what
appears
in
136
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
referendum.
what
if
the
people
interested
in
that
and
wanting
to
put
up
their
signs
came
along
and
saw
the
signs
on
137
for
mr.
marcus
who
is
running
for
something
so
they
tear
down
mr.
marcus'
sign
and
put
up
proposition
10,
is
there
any
ordinance
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
or
statute
of
the
state
of
california
that
makes
that
an
unlawful
act?
unknown
speaker
it
acquires
no
right.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
great
law
school
exam
on
personal
property,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
great
law
school
exam
question
in
a
personal
property
class.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
does
this
ordinance
include
a
prohibition
against
the
individual
homeowner
if
it
was
a
tree
or
shrub
on
property
from
erecting
a
pro
or
con
item
10
sign
on
his
property
on
his
tree
or
shrub?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
exception
as
i
read
28.04.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
i
have
a
tree
in
my
yard
that
tree
is
a
public
resource?
unknown
speaker
so
even
mr.
marcus
running
for
office
could
not
put
a
sign
up
on
his
own
home
lawn
"please
vote
for
me"?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alperin,
how
is
this
ordinance
enforced?
just
by
city
personnel
pulling
down
the
signs
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that
conceivably
in
justice
brennan's
example
a
person
could
be
charged
with
a
crime
for
putting
a
sign
up
on
a
tree
on
his
own
lawn?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
reasonably
but
literally
it
does.
unknown
speaker
unless
the
city
construed
to
the
contrary,
but
no
california
court
has
construed
the
ordinance.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
this
suit
was
a
facial
attack
on
the
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
expect
it
would
be
it
is
a
facial
attack.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alperin,
may
i
ask
a
question
following
up
on
justice
brennan's
inquiry
about
signs
on
private
property?
i
notice
in
the
complaint
they
allege
that
they
have
been
advised
by
the
police
officer
i
guess
whoever's
duty
it
was
to
enforce
that
they
will
sometimes
verify
that
the
sign
has
been
posted
without
the
consent
of
the
owner,
agent
or
occupant
and
then
make
a
physical
arrest
which
implies...
this,
of
course,
is
in
the
complaint...
that
sometimes
the
ordinance
is
enforced
against
posting
on
private
property.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alperin,
if
you
look
at
page
16
of
the
joint
appendix
there
you
have
i
believe
exhibit
b
which
you
filed
as
one
of
your
exhibits
to
your
answer
in
the
district
court,
and
as
i
read
it
it
is
a
statement
which
says
the
policy
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
in
enforcing
violations
and
it
describes
section
28.03
prohibits
the
painting
or
posting
of
any
handbill
or
sign
on
private
property
without
the
consent
of
the
owner,
agent
or
occupant.
section
28.04
prohibits
the
painting
or
posting
of
any
handbill
or
sign
on
utility
poles,
street
signs,
curbs
or
other
public
property.
unknown
speaker
now
was
that
summarizing
the
way
the
ordinance
is
enforced?
unknown
speaker
but
the
utility
may
not
consent
to
signs
on
its
poles.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
not
say
that
in
the
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
talking
about
the
legality
of
these
particular
prohibitions,
and
you
say
that
these
two,
one
of
the
other
of
these
forbids
signs
on
public
utility
poles,
utility
poles
even
if
the
utility
gave
its
consent.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
some
other
section
of
the
law
or
some
other
regulation
prohibits
the
utility
from
giving
its
consent
at
all.
that
is
what
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
the
kind
of
so-called
public
property
that
you
are
talking
about
in
28.04
includes
utility
poles.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alperin,
is
the
sidewalk
a
public
forum
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
gather
and
block
traffic--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
is
not
the
place
that
was
established
as
a
public
forum
for
communication
was
it?
unknown
speaker
is
the
purpose
to
transport
people
and
things
from
one
place
to
another?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
the
primary
purpose?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
we
should
read
the
ordinance
as
applying
only
to
public
property?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
think
we
should
read
28.04
as
covering
privately
owned
trees
and
shrubs?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
28.04
that
is
involved
here.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
the
city
may
not
close
down
the
public
property
to
these
signs.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
quite
understand,
mr.
canterbury.
certainly
on
its
face
28.04
is
not
limited
to
installations
on
public
property
is
it?
it
says
no
person
shall
post
or
otherwise
affix
any
handbill
or
sign
going
down
there
upon
any
tree,
shrub.
does
that
not
include
trees
or
shrubs
on
private
property?
unknown
speaker
how
do
i
read
it
just
looking
at
the
face
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
facial
attack
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
not
overbreadth
but
the
fact
that
even
if
it
were
limited
strictly
to
public
property
it
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
that
the
public
interest
just
is
not
sufficient.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were
limited
strictly
to
public
property
which
you
think
it
is.
at
least
that
is
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event
that
is
the
way
you
want...
that
is
your
submission
as
the
way
we
should
decide
this
case
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
on
its
face
it
does
not
cover
all
public
property,
does
it,
such
as
parks
and
other
areas?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
it
argued
it
had
safety
goals
as
well.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
an
ordinance
that
required
a
person
to
get
a
license
before
they
put
up
any
signs
and
the
deposit
of
cash
or
a
bond
equivalent
to
$1
for
every
sign
they
put
up
to
provide
the
cost
of
taking
them
down.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
make
it
ten
cents
a
sign
then.
is
it
the
amount
that
you
are
concerned
with?
unknown
speaker
who
is
supposed
to
bear
the
expense,
of
taking
them
down?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
not
be
a
reasonable
way
to
make
the
candidate
bear
the
expenses
ten
cents
a
sign
to
remove?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
reduce
it
to
one
cent
sign.
unknown
speaker
then
proceed
against
them
criminally?
unknown
speaker
mr.
canterbury,
supposing
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothesis
that
the
cities
had
a
criminal
statute
and
they
just
cannot
get
convictions
under
it.
it
is
hard
to
locate
the
candidates
after
the
elections
so
they
decide
to
go
with
the
chief
justice's,
suggestion
and
they
can
prove
in
court
that
this
one
cent
or
ten
cents
that
they
require
is
actually
the
cost
to
the
city
of
having
people
come
around
after
the
election
and
take
down
candidates'
sign
that
the
candidates
themselves
forget
about
and
do
not
take
down.
do
you
still
say
the
city
cannot
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
put
as
part
of
the
administration
cost
the
cost
to
the
city
of
taking
the
signs
down?
unknown
speaker
mr.
canterbury,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
nature
of
the
right
that
you
claim
exists?
assume
there
were
no
ordinance
at
all
here
first
of
all
and
you
wanted
to
put
up
the
sign
that
is
shown
on
exhibit
v
on
page
136
that
says
10>
["]
and
say
someone
opposed
to
proposition
10
came
along
and
just
removed
the
sign
because
they
were
opposed
to
it
and
substituted
a
10.
would
you
have
any
right
to
complain
about
that?
unknown
speaker
could
you
complain
to
him?
unknown
speaker
he
preserved
your
sign.
he
did
not
damage
it.
he
folded
it
up
neatly
and
put
it
in
a
plastic
case
so
it
did
not
hurt
it.
unknown
speaker
he
has
assumed
the
same
right
that
you...
is
it
the
first
one
that
gets
there
has
a
right
to
stay
there
forever?
how
long
do
you
have
the
right
to
keep
that
sign
up?
unknown
speaker
the
first
one
getting
there
in
effect
acquires
an
easement
in
the
premises?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
person
who
got
their
first
wanted
to
permanently
advertise
the
sale
of
his
home
or
something
like
that
or
permanent
garage
sale,
he
put
a
sign
up
there
and
said
i
want
to
leave
it
there
until
i
sell
everything
in
the
house.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
protected,
too?
unknown
speaker
this
ordinance
does
not
discriminate
between
the
two.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
think
that
there
is
a
right...
supposing
early
in
a
primary
say
now
if
a
democratic
candidate
wanted
to
put
a
sign
up
there
and
leave
it
up
there
for
ten
months,
would
he
have
the
right
to
keep
it
there
for
the
entire
period
of
the
election?
unknown
speaker
the
first
one
to
get
there
has
a
constitutional
right
to
keep
it
there?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
utility
company
which
owned
the
pole
said
we
do
not
want
the
sign
there.
could
it
have
taken
it
down?
say
there
is
no
ordinance
at
all
just
all
property
law
concepts
involved.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
our
cases
would
support
the
notion
that
a
public
utility
is
subject
to
the
same
obligation
that
you
contend
a
city
is
by
way
of
allowing
signs
to
be
posted
on
its
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
lot
of
water
that
has
flowed
under
the
damns
since
marsh
v.
alabama
so
far
as
our
decisions
are
concerned.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
right
why
could
the
candidate
after
he
is
elected
looking
forward
to
his
next
election
not
just
change
his
sign
that
he
had
up
during
the
campaign
and
say
john
jones
is
doing
a
good
job
by
the
city
council
and
just
leave
it
up
all
the
time
just
so
that
the
people
will
keep
his
name
in
their
minds?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
could
the
city
take
it
down
consistent
with
your
views?
unknown
speaker
no,
he
keeps
it
fresh
because
he
wants
the
public
to
respect
him
so
he
keeps
the
sign
fresh.
unknown
speaker
so
by
getting
there
first
he
can
permanently
occupy
that
particular
place
on
the
cross
bar?
unknown
speaker
how
long
would
that
be?
how
long
would
it
be
to
be
characterized
as
permanent?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
someone
wants
to
get
reelected
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
he
wants--
unknown
speaker
--could
the
signs
be
illuminated
without
violating
any
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
i
am
thinking,
for
example,
of
the
type
of
signs
that
you
sometimes
see
on
highways
that
are
illuminated
when
light
hits
them,
have
reflector
lights
so
that
people
can
read
them
at
night
as
well
as
in
the
daytime.
i
am
just
wondering
whether
there
are
any
limitations
on
the
type
of
signs
that
could
be
put
up.
you
say
there
is
self-regulation.
i
think
there
is
a
good
deal
to
that,
but
apart
from
that
you
have
some
eccentric
candidate
who
could
put
any
type
of
sign
up
i
take
it
under
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
some
limitation
in
size.
would
you
accept
that?
unknown
speaker
while
we
are
talking
about
the
courts'
decisions,
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
discussion
as
to
whether
this
ordinance
covers
private
property.
did
i
misread
the
decisions
below?
both
of
them
have
treated
the
ordinance
28.04
as
relating
only
to
public
property.
unknown
speaker
the
opinions
express
this
also.
unknown
speaker
the
first
paragraph
of
judge
nelson's
opinion
as
to
28.04
relating
to
public
property
and
on
page
18a
paragraph
18
of
the
trial
court's
findings
of
fact
one
of
the
other
means
available
was
stated
to
be
the
posting
of
signs
on
private
property.
i
think
you
have
already
agreed
that
the
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
that
this
ordinance
was
limited
to
public
property.
unknown
speaker
yet
in
your
brief,
mr.
canterbury,
you
rely
on
the
policy
statement
of
the
police
department.
you
quoted.
the
quote
is,
"los
angeles
municipal
code
prohibits
the
unauthorized
painting
or
posting
of
any
handbill
of
sign
upon
public
or
private
property.
"
you
rely
on
that
apparently.
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
but
it
says
more
than
that,
posting
of
any
handbill
or
sign
upon
public
or
private
property.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
only
thing
you
are
concerned
about
at
all
in
the
ordinance
is
the
restriction
on
the
use
of
power
lines
and
specifically
the
cross
arms.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
you
agreed
or
said
anyway
that
you
agreed
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
post
any
kind
of
a
sign
on
a
fire
hydrant
and
some
of
the
other
items
listed
here.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
utility
poles
themselves?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
do
that
but
others
do.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
dirty.
unknown
speaker
the
candidates
who
do
not
want
to
get
elected.
unknown
speaker
but
your
submission
here
is
i
take
it
that
that
prohibition
of
signs
or
posters
on
utility
poles
is
also
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
the
ordinance
just
related
to
utility
poles
you
would
not
be
here?
unknown
speaker
you
would
think
that
ordinance
was
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
which
it
probably
would
be.
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it
you
would
be
satisfied
then
if
the
court
agreed
with
you
that
the
ordinance
would
be
be
applied
to
the
cross
bars
but
was
perfectly
constitutional
as
applied
to
any
other
public
property?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
make
them
so
small
that
nobody
could
read
them.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
as
soon
as
they
become
large
enough
to
read
from
any
distance...
you
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
your
friend
who
was
not
sure,
but
i
will
ask
you.
in
any
election
in
recent
times
that
you
are
aware
of
what
was
the
maximum
number
of
candidates
who
were
appealing
to
the
voters
in
los
angeles?
unknown
speaker
ten
candidates?
a
hundred
candidates?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
written
ballots
or
voting
machines
out
there?
unknown
speaker
you
are
from
san
francisco
any
way?
unknown
speaker
are
you
not
taking
a
risk,
a
san
francisco
lawyer
going
to
litigate
in
los
angeles?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
lost.
but
another
los
angeles
person
bailed
you
out.
no
one
seriously
questions
that
a
city
wants
to
permit
these
things
there
is
no
barrier
to
their
permitting
them.
the
only
question
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
right
of
the
candidate
or
even
of
a
commercial
enterprise
to
post
signs
on
public
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
can
do
it,
so
can
everybody.
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
that
clutter,
that
impact
on
the
environment
is
something
the
city
has
no
right
to
control?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
looking
at
the
picture
that
you
put
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
city's
power
to
regulate
the
right
of
a
person
or
property
owner
to
put
a
sign
on
his
own
property
may
be
a
good
deal
more
limited
than
the
city's
right
to
regulate
the
right
of
others
to
put
signs
on
property
owned
by
the
city.
do
you
not
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
the
city
is
freer
to
or
has
more
latitude
in
telling
me
if
i
own
a
tastee
freeze
along
the
street
that
i
cannot
put
up
a
sign
on
the
building
that
says
tastee
freeze.
you
say
that
very
likely
it
can
do
that,
but
that
it
cannot
tell
someone
from
50
miles
away
that
he
cannot
put
a
sign
up
on
a
city
owned
utility
pole.
unknown
speaker
could
the
city
of
los
angeles
prevent
you
from
putting
one
of
these
signs
in
the
public
square?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
know
what
a
public
square
is?
unknown
speaker
you
are
trying
not
to
answer
the
question.
you
pick
what
you
think
is
a
public
square
in
los
angeles.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
can
you
bar
public
signs
in
that
square
that
you
pick?
unknown
speaker
you
use
two
quite
different
tests.
you
first
said
would
it
be
destroyed
and
secondly
you
said
would
it
be
impaired.
which
is
the
test
you
recommend?
unknown
speaker
substantially
impaired.
that
is
a
third
one.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
public
square
in
front
of
the
court
house?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
you
can
put
up
a
sign
in
the
public
square
of
the
court
house
of
every
candidate
who
is
running
for
office
assuming
you
have
that
much
room?
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that
could
they
pass
a
law
saying
no
signs
in
the
public
square
in
front
of
the
court
house
without
the
city's
permission?
is
that
a
constitutional
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
can
put
up
any
sign
in
front
of
the
court
house
you
want
to
put
up?
unknown
speaker
so
the
aesthetic
values
of
the
city
are
to
be
determined
by
each
individual?
unknown
speaker
the
city
has
a
hearing
and
they
decided
that
multiple
signs
of
multiple
colors
involving
multiple
problems
would
destroy
the
aesthetic
value
of
not
of
the
whole
city
at
least
of
the
court
house
lawn
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
let
us
go
back
to
the
priority
matter
that
justice
white
mentioned
earlier.
suppose
one
enterprising
candidate
with
considerable
cash
goes
out
very
early
with
a
crew
of
people
and
he
covers
every
pole
of
every
utility
all
of
the
places
that
are
involved
here,
all
the
cross
wires,
all
the
space
with
his
own
name
"vote
for".
there
is
no
room
for
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
now
the
city
deals
with
this
when
it
happens.
how
do
they
deal
with
it
when
it
happens?
you
mean
they
have
to
draw
an
ordinance
in
advance
that
recites
standards
that
would
enable
the
police
to
deal
with
that
particular
problem?
unknown
speaker
mr.
canterbury,
i
take
it
you
really
are
not
defending
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
except
insofar
as
it
applies
to
the
places
you
want
to
put
signs
on.
unknown
speaker
did
they
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
it
is
only
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
cross
bars.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
overbreadth.
you
can
object
to
that
directly.
are
you
saying
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
also
regulates
some
other
property
or
what?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
agreed...
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
allow
the
ordinance
if
it
applied
only
to
the
utility
poles
would
it?
you
say
i
thought
that
a
utility
pole
ordinance
would
be
quite
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
any
of
your
submission
today
is
inconsistent
with
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
several
dozen.
