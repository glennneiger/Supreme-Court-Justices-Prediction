mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
important
constitutional
issue
whether
the
city
of
los
angeles
may
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
prohibit
the
attachment
of
signs
to
items
of
public
and
utility
property
which
are
located
on
and
along
the
city
streets
and
sidewalks.
the
city
submits
that
the
constitution
permits
this
regulation.
municipal
code
section
28.04
is
the
city
ordinance
at
hand.
it
prohibits
the
attachment
of
signs
without
regard
to
their
content
to
enumerated
items
of
public
and
utility
property
located
along
the
streets.
among
those
items
of
property
on
which
signs
may
not
be
posted
are
utility
poles
and
their
appurtenances
and
in
particular
with
regard
to
this
case
the
cross
wires
which
help
support
those
utility
poles,
traffic
and
street
signs,
street
lights--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--the
cross
wires
are
a
wire
or
cable
which
attaches
the
upright
wooden
utility
pole
to
another
pole
on
the
other
side
of
the
sidewalk,
and
that
pole
is
then
attached
from
the
top
of
the
pole
on
the
other
side
of
the
sidewalk
to
the
top
of
the
wooden
utility
pole
with
a
wire
and
it
helps
support
the
pole
in
an
upright
position.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
some
of
it
is
owned
by
private
utility
companies,
and
what
is
owned
by
private
utility
companies--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--without
knowing
exactly
how
many
of
the
utility
poles
are
owned
by
private
utility
companies
and
how
much
by
the
city,
they
are
owned
either
by
the
city
or
by
the
utility
companies.
those
poles
which
are
owned
by
the
city
are
leased
to
the
private
utilities
for
their
wires.
when
the
private
utilities
own
the
utility
poles
the
city
leases
space
for
its
wires.
basically
these
are
power
wires
that
the
city
owns
and
communication
transmission
wires,
telephone
wires
which
the
private
utilities
own.
so
they
are
jointly
used.
they
are
located,
most
of
them
at
least,
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
next
to
the
roadway.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
not
with
regard
to
these
utility
poles.
the
city
is
regulating
the
attachment
of
signs
on
these
utility
poles
and
on
their
appurtenances
for
public
policy
reasons,
for
traffic
safety
reasons,
for
reasons
of
safety
to
workers
who
need
to
climb
the
poles
in
order
to
repair
wires
and
other
equipment
at
the
top
of
the
poles
and
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
to
the
extent
that
is
possible
visual
clutter
which
is
directly
caused
by
signs
that
proliferate
on
these
utility
poles,
on
the
cross
bars,
on
city
street
lighting
systems
and
on
numerous
others
of
these
items
of
property
most
of
which
are
public
property
which
are
located
on
and
along
the
streets
and
the
sidewalks.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
the
record
does
not
show
exactly
how
many
there
were.
there
were
a
number
of
candidates
for
this
office,
at
least
two,
mr.
vincent
and
i
believe
another
nonincumbent
who
was
elected
to
the
city
council
in
that
district.
there
are
15
city
council
districts,
and
in
half
of
the
years
half
of
the
members
run.
in
some
of
the
years
we
also
have
a
number
of
city-wide
offices
which
run
and
there
are,
of
course,
always
several
candidates
for
various
of
these
offices.
so
there
are
a
number
of
candidates.
signs,
of
course,
are
posted
not
only
by
candidates
and
those
who
support
them
but
also
by
others
who
have
both
political
and
nonpolitical
messages
that
they
want
displayed.
we
have
those
who
espouse
viewpoints,
positions
on
public
issues
and
of
course
we
have
those
who
put
up
signs
for
commercial
purposes,
those
who
want
to
invite
people
to
their
disco
or
their
dance
or
to
tell
them
where
they
can
find
the
latest
built
condominium
for
sale
and
those
who
have
garage
sales
and
those
who
have
merely
lost
their
pets
and
want
them
returned
if
someone
finds
them.
so
we
see
attached
to
all
of
these
objects
many
different
kinds
of
signs
not
only
political
signs.
in
fact
the
record
indicates
that
probably
the
vast
majority
of
the
signs
that
are
attached
are
nonpolitical
commercial
signs.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
yes,
they
are.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
these
signs
attached
to
these
cross
wires
will
generally
not
affect
the
safety
of
the
workers.
however,
if
you
look
at
the
picture
on
page
136
you
will
see
that
the
sign
is
located
very,
very
close
to
the
upright
pole,
and
it
is
certainly
possible
that
if
the
sign
is
attached
that
close
to
the
pole
that
a
worker
climbing
the
pole
might
hit
his
foot
on
the
sign
and
lose
balance.
but
generally
speaking
signs
on
these
cross
bars
do
not
cause
a
problem
for
the
workers
who
climb
the
pole.
they
cause
other
problems.
they
may
very
well
regardless
of
their
size
hide
a
traffic
hazard
and
certainly
they
not
only
add
to
the
visual
clutter
but
as
the
district
court
found
they
encourage
others
to
post
signs
in
other
unsightly
places
and
in
that
way
add
to
the
proliferation.
one
of
the
problems
which
the
city
faces
especially
a
city
like
los
angeles
which
is
so
large,
the
third
largest
city
in
the
nation
with
regard
to
population,
one
of
the
largest
with
regard
to
its
size...
there
are
465
square
miles
approximately
of
the
city
and
over
6,400
miles
of
streets
and
roadways
along
which
all
of
these
signs
are
located.
these
are
a
great
number
of
signs,
a
great
number
of
objects
on
which
signs
can
be
posted
and
on
which
signs
are
posted.
you
have
all
of
these
objects
with
signs
on
them.
you
have
a
lot
of
visual
clutter.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
it
is
not
clear
whether
that
is
an
unlawful
act.
by
destroying
someone
else's
sign
they
may
very
well
be
committing
a
misdemeanor,
a
destruction
of
someone...
malicious
mischief,
destruction
of
someone
else's
property.
the
proposition
could
be
made,
however,
that
when
a
sign
has
been
attached
illegally
to
an
object
of
public
property
or
utility
property
on
which
it
has
been
prohibited
that
it
is
treated
as
abandoned
property.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
we
do
not
believe
that
someone
who
puts
up
a
sign
acquires
any
rights.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
when
they
put
up
that
sign
illegally
they
lose
their
rights
to
the
sign.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
i
am
sorry,
mr.
rehnquist,
i
did
not--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--yes,
sir.
it
certainly
would.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
the
city
has
generally
interpreted
this
ordinance
to
apply
to
signs
which
are
either
on
city
property
or
on
a
city
parkway.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
city
has
ever
attempted
to--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--on
its
face
it
would
apply
to
any
tree.
it
has
not
to
my
knowledge
been
construed
by
the
courts.
as
i
say
just
from
my
general
knowledge
we
do
not
believe
that
the
city
has
interpreted
it
that
way.
however,
the
city
certainly
has
a
public
policy
interest
in
protecting
all
trees
and
shrubs
in
the
city
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
are
privately
owned
or
publicly
owned
because
trees
and
shrubs
are
a
public
resource.
having
trees
and
shrubs
adds
to
the
beauty
of
the
community.
it
adds
to
the
vitality
of
the
community.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
it
is
not
public
property,
but
certainly
having
that
tree
adds
to
the
vitality
and
to
the
beauty
of
that
community.
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
city
has
a
right
to
remove
signs
that
you
put
up
on
your
own
tree,
and
the
city
has
not
interpreted
its
ordinance
to
permit
it
to
do
that.
on
its
face
there
is
no
exception.
the
ordinance
just
says
any
tree,
any
shrub.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
arguably
that
is
the
case,
but
the
city
would
certainly
not
seek
to
enforce
its
ordinance
in
that
case.
it
would
not
interpret
its
ordinance
as
applying
in
that
case
unless
it
is
a
piece
of
property
which
is
on
the
public
right
of
way
which
is
adjacent
to
the
street.
there
the
city
certainly
has
a
right
because
the
city
has
an
easement
and
indeed
in
many
cases
has
planted
those
trees.
but
if
we
are
talking
about
a
tree
otherwise
in
his
yard
or
in
his
backyard,
somewhere
else
on
his
property
we
just
would
not
interpret
the
ordinance
as
being
applicable.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
it
is
generally
enforced
by
city
personnel
pulling
down
these
signs.
it
has
also
been
enforced
criminally
and
could
be
enforced
criminally.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
theoretically
that
may
be
possible
unless
you
read
the
ordinance
as
not
applying.
it
would
not
reasonably
apply
to
the
tree
in
his
backyard
or
otherwise
in
his
front
yard.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
yes,
we
would
have
to
concede
that
literally--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--to
our
knowledge
this
ordinance
has
been
construed
in
one
unreported
case...
not
construed
by
the
constitutionality,
has
been
tested
in
one
unreported
case
of
a
superior
court
appellate
department
decision.
it
is
an
unreported
opinion,
and
in
that
case
that
court
ruled
that
the
ordinance
might
be
unconstitutional,
send
it
back
down
the
municipal
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
as
to
the
facts
which
might
support
a
valid
public
purpose.
the
city
lost
a
motion
in
the
municipal
court
and
did
not
appeal
that.
but
no,
it
has
not
actually
been
construed
and
certainly
to
our
knowledge
has
not
been
construed
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
private
tree
on
private
property
is
subject
to
the
ordinance.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
interpretation.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
right.
this
suit
is
concerned
with
objects
which
located
on
or
adjacent
to
the
public
streets.
the
litigation
did
not
deal
either
at
the
district
court
level
or
the
level
of
the
ninth
circuit
with
questions
of
trees
and
shrubs
that
might
be
located
on
someone's
own
private
property
and
so
that
question
was
just
never
litigated
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
certainly
correct,
but
what
was
litigated
and
what
all
of
the
attention
was
placed
on
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
objects
including
trees
and
shrubs
which
are
located
or
and
along
the
streets
are
a
public
forum.
the
city
contends
that
they
are
not
a
public
forum
even
though
they
are
located
on
and
along
the
street.
a
public
forum
is
a
place
which
is
either
specifically
designated
by
a
government
as
being
a
public
forum
or
which
by
tradition
has
become
a
public
forum.
the
streets
and
the
sidewalks
themselves
are
a
traditional
public
forum.
they
are
a
place
which
traditionally
has
been
used
among
other
things
for
communication
of
public
issues.
they
have
been
legitimately
used
in
that
fashion
for
hundreds
of
years.
in
fact,
they
have
probably
been
used
for
even
longer
than
that.
however,
these
particular
objects
of
public
property
although
located
in
the
streets
were
erected
for
quite
different
reasons.
they
were
erected
either
so
that
the
city
could
string
its
utility
wires
along
the
streets
in
a
convenient
place
or
with
regard
to
the
lighting
system
so
that
the
streets
could
be
lit
for
safety
purposes
or
with
regard
to
posts
and
poles
that
are
erected
for
the
purpose
of
displaying
the
city's
own
traffic
and
street
information,
information
about
where
the
city
streets
are,
what
street
someone
may
be
driving
on,
how
fast
that
person
can
drive,
where
that
person
can
park
or
not
park.
they
were
not
erected
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
private
individuals
the
right
to
put
up
any
signs
that
they
wanted.
so
they
were
not
designated
by
the
government
as
a
public
forum,
and
indeed
although
they
have
been
used
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
they
have
not
been
used
legally
or
legitimately.
the
city's
ordinance
prohibits
their
use.
the
city
contends
that
an
item
of
government
property
cannot
by
tradition
become
a
public
forum
unless
it
is
legitimately
used
as
a
public
forum.
here
these
objects
have
never
been
legitimately
used
as
a
public
forum.
they
obviously
have
been
used
because
the
signs
have
been
posted
and
the
signs
have
been
removed,
but
they
have
been
used
illegally.
illegal
use
certainly
cannot
result
in
the
creation
of
a
public
forum
especially
where
the
city
has
strong
public
policy
interests
which
are
served
by
its
ordinance.
here
the
city
has
public
policy
interests
which
are
directly
served
by
this
ordinance
and
they
are
interests
which
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
over
and
over
again
as
being
substantial,
legitimate,
even
compelling
government
interests.
certainly
traffic
safety
is
a
substantial
government
interest.
certainly
aesthetics
is
a
substantial,
very
important,
very
legitimate
government
interest.
it
relates--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--there
is
another
city
ordinance
which
is
another
section
of
the
municipal
code,
section
28.03,
which
prohibits
the
attachment
of
signs
to
buildings
and
to
any
private
property
without
the
consent
of
the
owner.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
in
further
answer
to
mr.
brennan's
question
and
your
question
following
up
on
that
with
regard
to
the
trees,
certainly
because
of
the
existence
of
that
other
section
we
could
construe
the
reference
to
trees
in
section
28.04
to
relate
only
to
trees
on
public
property
because
we
have
another
section
that
relates
to
attachment
of
signs
to
private
property
and
that
certainly
would
include
trees
on
private
property
which
would
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
both
ordinances
together.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
yes,
that
is
true
with
the
only
exception
that
indeed
some
of
the
utility
poles
although
used
by
the
public
are
private
property
because
they
belong
to
privately
owned
utilities.
however,
in
a
general
sense
section
28.03
relates
to
private
property
and
permits
signs
on
private
property
assuming
that
the
owner
of
that
property
or
someone
in
control
of
that
property
consents
to
the
attachment
of
a
sign
on
that
property
in
section
28.04.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
correct.
the
utility
may
not
consent--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--the
utility...
it
is
not
a
part
of
this
record.
public
utilities
in
california,
private
utilities
in
california
are
governed
by
rules
and
regulations
of
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
and
the
public
utilities
commission
prohibits
the
attachment
of
anything
to
the
upright
poles
for
safety
purposes.
that
regulation
is
not
in
any
way
part
of
this
record.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
that
is
correct.
section
28.04
prohibits
the
attachment
of
signs
on
any
utility
pole--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--a
state
agency
regulation
prohibits
them
from
giving
its
consent
at
all
but
so
does
section
28.04.
it
prohibits
the
attachment
of
signs
to
utility
poles
because
the
attachment
of
those
signs
causes
safety
hazards
and
adds
to
visual
clutter.
certainly
the
government
may
regulate
private
property--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--it
includes...
the
public
property
includes
the
publicly
owned
utility
properties,
but
the
section
also
prohibits
attachment
of
signs
to
the
utility
poles
that
are
owned
by
privately
owned
utility
companies.
because
the
items
of
property
that
are
regulated
by
section
28.04
are
not
part
of
a
public
forum
this
court
needs
to
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
regulation
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
circumstances
that
the
city
faces
and
whether
or
not
it
leaves
open
ample
channels
or
avenues
of
communication.
indeed,
the
ordinance
meets
both
prongs
of
those
tests.
it
is
certainly
reasonable
because
it
directly
relates
to
the
achievement
of
important
and

if
poles
cause...
if
signs
cause
a
safety
problem
or
if
signs
result
in
clutter
which
mars
the
visual
environment
then
certainly
the
most
logical,
most
direct
and
really
the
only
effective
way
of
eliminating
those
problems
is
by
prohibiting
the
attachment
of
those
signs
which
cause
the
problem.
this
ordinance
does
that.
this
ordinance
also
leaves
open
several
ample
avenues
of
communication.
it
leaves
open
several
traditional
uses
of
the
streets
and
sidewalks,
giving
public
speeches,
holding
parades,
distribution
of
handbills,
door-to-door
distribution
and
it
also
permits
signs
to
be
posted
on
private
property
and
it
permits
signs
to
be
held,
carried
by
people
in
the
streets.
it
does
not
prohibit
any
of
those
things.
all
it
does
is
prohibit
the
attachment
of
signs
to
those
items
of
property
which
are
enumerated
in
the
ordinance.
in
addition
to
that,
another
section
of
the
municipal
code,
section
62.132,
which
is
found
in
an
appendix
to
the
appellee's
brief
on
page
a-2
in
that
appendix
permits
street
banners
to
be
attached
to
the
tops
of
the
lighting
standards
that
are
found
in
the
streets.
this
does
permit
one
use
of
the
public
property
located
in
the
street
for
expressive
purposes
under
circumstances
where
the
city
has
determined
that
problems
of
traffic
safety
and
visual
clutter
do
not
exist.
the
city
would
like
to
reserve
the
five
minutes
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
the
sidewalk
is
indeed
a
public
forum.
it
is
a
place
where
people
gather
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
and
also
where
they
gather
to
discuss
public
issues.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
if
they
gather
and
block
traffic
then
the
city
could
certainly
enforce
an
ordinance
which
would
be
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
one
of
the
purposes
of
sidewalks--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--that
is
one
of
its
purposes.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
it
may
even
be
the
primary
purpose,
but
one
of
its
purposes
just
like
the
street
certainly
is
for
people
as
long
as
they
do
not
block
the
use
of
the
sidewalk
by
people
who
want
to
get
from
one
place
to
another
a
place
of
discussion.
that
does
not
mean,
however,
that
the
concrete,
the
actual
physical
concrete
is
a
place
where
people
can
make
drawings
or
tape
on
their
signs.
it
means
that
the
place
where
people
stand
in
which
they
stand
is
the
public
forum
rather
than
the
physical
property
itself.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
do
have
some
comments
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
chief
justice's
question
of
the
number
of
candidates
although
i
do
not
know
the
precise
number
even
a
guess
on
the
number
of
candidates
who
ran
at
the
time
mr.
vincent
ran
we
can
tell
the
court
that
it
has
been
our
experience
that
normally
for
all
of
the
offices
we
do
have
several
dozen
candidates.
i
do
remember
back--
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
--several
dozen.
mr.
anthony
saul
alperin
it
may
be
anywhere
from
18
up
to
a
larger
number.
in
1969
for
the
first
time
candidates
ran
for
seven
districts
of
a
community
college
board.
there
were
more
than
100
candidates
who
ran
for
those
positions
so
that
there
can
very
well
be
quite
a
large
number
of
candidates
running
in
city
elections.
we
also
need
to
understand
that
in
the
even
numbered
years
candidates
are
running
for
county
office,
state
legislative
office,
state-wide
office,
congressional
office
and
for
president
and
vice
president.
we
know
that
in
a
city
as
large
as
los
angeles
there
quite
a
number
of
legislative
districts.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
candidates
who
are
running.
this
is
not
just
a
phenomenon
that
creeps
up
every
time
we
have
a
city
election.
it
also
is
a
phenomenon
that
we
have
every
time
we
have
a
state-wide
or
national
election,
and
it
is
a
phenomenon
that
we
have
all
of
the
time
because
not
only
do
we
have
candidates
we
have
people
with
other
views
and
we
have
people
with
commercial
messages.
indeed,
these
signs
are
not
self-regulating
as
we
know
because
there
are
indeed
so
many
of
them.
indeed
because
there
are
so
many
of
them
and
because
the
city
is
so
large
and
spread
out
and
there
are
so
many
roadways
and
objects
on
which
these
signs
can
be
attached
there
is
really
no
way
in
which
the
city
can
reasonably
and
effectively
regulate
any
other
way.
if
we
found
that
there
are...
let's
say
that
the
city
was
to
say
that
you
could
have
one
sign
on
every
three
poles.
the
city
does
not
believe
that
is
reasonable
for
one
reason
at
least
because
what
if
the
city
finds
three
signs
on
one
pole.
how
in
the
world
is
the
city
going
to
know
which
sign
was
there
first
and,
therefore,
which
two
signs
the
city
could
remove?
is
the
city
required
to
hold
a
hearing
as
to
thousands
of
poles
where
it
finds
more
than
one
sign
on
those
poles
in
order
to
determine
which
sign
was
entitled
to
be
there?
certainly
that
cannot
be
the
case.
certainly
any
other
regulation
would
be
unreasonable,
unworkable,
unpoliceable,
would
impose
terrific
and
expensive
administrative
burdens
on
the
city.
the
court
should
well
recognize
that
in
this
area
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
not
like
the
city
of
san
francisco
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
believes
that
it
needs
different
regulations
because
of
conditions
that
are
specific
to
the
city
of
los
angeles
which
is
certainly
much
larger
and
much
more
populous
and
much
different
from
the
city
of
san
francisco
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
ought
to
be
entitled
to
pick
those
means
which
it
believes
will
best
solve
its
problems.
as
long
as
the
city
is
not
limiting
speech
so
that
there
are
no
alternative
channels
of
communication
and
so
long
as
it
is
not
saying
to
one
candidate
i
will
let
you
put
up
your
signs
and
to
another
candidate
i
will
not
let
you
put
up
your
sign,
if
it
is
not
doing
that
then
the
city
ought
to
be
entitled
to
enforce,
to
enact
and
keep
and
enforce
this
regulation
especially
because
those
objects
which
the
city
prohibits
signs
on
are
not
a
public
forum.
this
court
ought
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
which
found
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
granted
summary
judgment
on
the
constitutional
issue
to
the
plaintiffs.
for
the
reasons
that
we
cited
in
our
briefs
and
the
arguments
today,
the
city
submits
that
its
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
and
urges
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
