mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
28.04
as
it
is
enforced
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
constitutes
an
absolute
ban
on
all
temporary
signs
on
all
public
property.
as
such
it
is
a
prior
restraint
on
an
important
form
of
political
expression.
that
form
is
the
temporary
campaign
sign
that
has
been
with
us
for
centuries.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
the
portion
of
the
ordinance
that
we
challenged
on
appeal
was
only
section
28.04.
we
abandoned
a
challenge
to
28.03,
and
we
believe
that
the
city
is
entitled
to
prohibit
the
posting
on
private
property
unless
the
campaign
officials
or
election
committee
has
the
permission
of
private
property
owners
to
post
the
signs.
the
one
exception--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
do
not,
your
honor.
it
does
not
say
that,
and
although
the
city
has
stretched
this
ordinance
to
include
many
means
i
do
not
believe
that
up
until
today
it
has
included
that
mean.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
right.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
may
regulate
the
place--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--it
is
really
unclear
from
the
record,
and
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
enforced.
i
think
that
part
of
the
problem
here--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
that
reading
does
lend
that
interpretation
of
prohibition
on
that
type
of
property.
frankly
we--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--it
is
a
facial
attack,
but
our
complaint
makes
it
clear
that
we
are
also
attacking
it
as
it
is
interpreted
by--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--as
applied.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
frankly,
i
do
think
that
as
enforced
and
from
the
record
that
we
have
before
us
that
the
issue
here
in
my
mind
is
whether
it
can
ban
all
signs
on
public
property.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes,
as
interpreted
and
as
enforced
by
the
police
department.
i
think
part
of
the
confusion
stems
from
the
police
department's
interpretation
of
the
section,
and
that
is
exhibit
b
to
the
complaint
that
was
read
earlier
that
the
police
department
has
its
own
idea
in
los
angeles
what
this
ordinance
means.
the
police
department
believes
that
it
prohibits
all
signs
on
all
public
property
and
apparently
as
well
some
trees
and
other
types
of
objects
off
of
public
property
and
on
private
property.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
deficiencies
in
a
sense
in
the
ordinance,
that
is,
that
it
is
underinclusive.
los
angeles
argues
that
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance
is
to
protect
the
city's
environment.
if
that
were
the
case
one
would
suspect
that
objects
that
were--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
in
fact
i
think
that
a
reading
of
the
code
leads
one
to
suspect
that
that
is
the
sole
purpose
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
legislature
when
it
passed
that
ordinance
because
the
objects
that
are
listed
are
fire
hydrants,
traffic
directional
signals
and
the
like,
objects
that
no
one
is
entitled
to
post
political
signs
on.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
would
be
an
impermissible
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
this
type
of
political
expression.
i
believe
that
some
monitoring
and
perhaps
even
a
reasonable
permit
system
might
in
some
situations
be
permissible.
a
dollar
a
sign
would
be
awfully
expensive
to
conduct--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--it
is
the
amount
and
it
is
the
fact
that
the
candidates
running
for
nation-wide
office
or
even
state-wide
office
would
have
to
go
into
each
town,
determine
what
the
particular
permit
requirements
were,
learn
those,
apply
them
and
post
their
signs
after
they
posted
their
bonds.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
the
candidates
should
bear
that
expense.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
suggest
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
there
is
no--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--the
principle
i
think,
your
honor,
is
that
the
candidate
or
the
persons
responsible
for
posting
the
signs
should
be
made
to
take
the
sign
down
after
the
election
and
if
they
do
not
then
a
penalty
may
be
imposed
at
that
time.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
at
that
tire
that
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
believe
that
that
would
bear
some
scrutiny,
your
honor,
for
this
reason
that
under
that
situation
posited
you
would
essentially
have
law
abiding
candidates
who
took
down
their
signs
after
the
election
paying
for
the
misfeasance
of
those
who
do
not.
i
do
think
that
an
assessment
might
be
appropriate
in
some
cases,
a
reasonable
assessment,
for
the
administration
of
the
program
itself,
the
sign
program.
if
there
is
a
permit
or
some
monitoring
to
take
place
presumably
that
will
be
of
some
cost
to
the
city.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
would
prefer
that
it
not
be.
again,
for
the
reason
i
mentioned
before
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
appropriate.
in
baldwin
v.
bedwood
city,
a
1976
case
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
did
comment
that
reasonable
fees
and
assessments
might
be
permissible
if
the
city
can
show
that
they
reasonably
relate
to
the
administration
of
the
sign
program.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
could
not
complain
to
the
city
about
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
well,
he
has
destroyed
it
for
our
purposes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
you
have
a
right
to
keep
the
sign
up
until
the
election
has
passed
and
the
sign
has
served
the
purpose.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
use
the
term
"easement"
but
i
do
believe
that
for
the
same
reason
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--of
course,
that
would
be
a
form
of
commercial
speech
which
would
not
be--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--it
may
be
protected
but
not
to
the
same
degree
that
political
speech
is.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
this
ordinance
does
not.
it
might
well,
but
it
does
not.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
think
the
general
rule
would
be
that
he
would
have
a
right
to...
i
think
that
the
candidate
must
make
that
decision
ahead
of
time,
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
use
the
property,
yes.
i
think
he
has
a
private
right
not
to
have
his
property
destroyed.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
in
that
situation
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
public
utilities
are
able
to
erect
poles
for
the
public
benefit
under
the
public
charter
and
they
are
for
our
purposes
public
utility
poles.
los
angeles
apparently
takes
the
same
position.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
your
honor,
i
think
that
marsh
v.
alabama
does
support
that
proposition
especially
if
it
is
found
in
any
particular
town
that
the
utility
poles
are
universally
owned.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
in
the
shopping
center
cases
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
foundational
underpinnings
of
marsh
would
apply
in
the
situation--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--well,
i
think
that
he
could;
however,
he
risks--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--no,
your
honor,
the
city
could
not
unless
that
sign
became
tattered
and
worn
or
became
a
threat.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
have
to
answer
that
i
believe
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
do
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
no,
your
honor,
perhaps
that
is
the
answer
to
this
question.
i
only
argue
that
temporary
political
signs
should
be
given
access
to
public
property.
once
a
sign
is
placed
for
so
long
as
to
be
characterized
as
permanent,
that
i
believe
is
a
different
matter
because
that
is--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
cannot
give
an
arbitrary
time
period.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
it
is
almost
assured,
your
honor,
that
if
he
keeps
the
signs
up
he
will
never
be
elected.
our
point
here
is
that
political
signs
are
to
a
great
degree
self-regulated.
candidates
post
elections
to
win
elections...
post
signs
to
win
elections,
not
to
lose
them.
the
candidate
who
has
that
in
mind
in
a
limited
campaign
budget
as
most
candidates
do
will
put
his
sign
up
during
the
times
that
will
do
him
the
most
good
and
that
is
the
weeks
before
the
election.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
we
do
not
contend
that
we
would
have
any
right
to
illuminate
the
signs
if
the
illumination
would
involve
running
wires
up
the
poles.
again,
that
would
look
more
like
a
permanent
sign
but
more
importantly
would
very
likely
interfere
with
the
primary
use
of
the
utility
pole.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
well,
your
honor,
again
i
think
that
the
answer
lies
in
whether
the
sign
constitutes
any
hazard
to
the
public,
interferes
with
traffic
and
the
like.
it
cannot
i
contend
be
pulled
down
because
the
city
does
not
find
it
attractive.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
has
been
the
assumption
in
this
case
from
the
very
start.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
your
honor,
the
reason
that
that
was
quote
was
to
illustrate
that
the
police
department
considers
28.04
to
ban
all
signs
on
public
property.
that
was
the
reason
for
our--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--your
honor,
that
is
the
case
and
the
ordinance
might
be
more
offensive
than
i
thought
it
to
be
until
today.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
your
honor,
that
is
the
type
of
property
that
my
clients
have
traditionally
posted
these
signs
on,
and
when
they
undertook
this--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
do
agree,
your
honor,
but
the
complaint
alleges
that
my
client
posts
signs
over
the
cross
bar
in
the
way
that
is
depicted
at
page
137--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
contend--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--others
do.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
an
ordinance
prohibiting
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--that
is
right.
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
signs
posted
in
that
way
are
not
signs
at
all.
all
they
are
are
8
x
11
flyers
that
are
glued
or
tacked
or
stapled
onto
the
vertical
shaft
of
the
pole
itself.
our
signs
by
contrast
were
actually
designed
by
mr.
daily
of
cogs,
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
as
an
alternative
to
that
kind
of
an
abusive
posting,
and
the
sign
as
depicted
at
page
137
of
the
record
shows
how
the
sign
can
be
placed
on
the
public
property--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--no,
your
honor.
our
argument
here
is
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--we--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--yes.
the
reason
is
this.
the
district
court
found
that
signs
posted
on
the
vertical
shaft
of
the
pole
itself
created
a
danger
to
repairmen
because
in
climbing
the
pole
they
may
slip
on
sign
posted
on
that
pole
and
again
the
reason
that
our
signs
are
posted
on
the
cross
arms
is
to
avoid
that
problem.
we
asked
in
interrogatory
number
11
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
whether
signs
of
the
type
posted
by
my
client
created
what
are
described
as
the
overhead
problems
by
the
police
department
and
city
maintenance
folks,
and
they
admitted
in
that
answer
that
in
fact
our
signs
do
not
constitute
that
type
of
a
hazard.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
no,
i
think
that
again
would
be
too
broad.
of
course,
the
court
will
if
it
decides
to
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
will
go
back
and
los
angeles
will
have
an
opportunity
to
follow
the
guidelines
set
down
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
regulate
signs
according
to
size
or
placement.
i
believe
that
signs
can
be
severely
limited
and
aesthetically
sensitive--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--well,
that
would
be...
we
have
a
right
to
post--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--again,
the
question
is
one
of
reasonableness.
the
size...
we
should
be
able
to
post
signs
of
sufficient
size
so
that
the
name
of
the
candidate
and
the
office
he
is
running
for
which
is
the
theme
of
these
campaign
signs
can
be
clearly
read.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
simply
do
not
know.
there
are
many
elections,
local
elections
in
los
angeles
and
other
cities
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--we
have
voting
machines.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
incidentally
san
francisco
allows
signs
on
public
utility
poles
and--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--well,
the
district
court
apparently
came
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question
however.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
oh,
absolutely.
anyone
running
for
public
office.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
first
of
all,
i
would
not
characterize
it
myself
as
clutter,
but
assuming
that
that
is
the
way
we
wish
to
characterize
it--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--yes,
your
honor.
actually
those
pictures
in
large
part
were
put
in
by
los
angeles.
in
going
back
to
the
record
the
picture
depicted
at
page
137
i
think
illustrates
our
point
very
vividly.
depicted
in
the
foreground
is
a
temporary
political
sign.
i
do
not
think
that
the
photographer
intended
to
illustrate
this
point,
but
in
the
background
there
is
a
virtual
montage
of
permanent
signs
that
are
much
more
offensive
and
much
more
a
clutter
than
the
temporary
political
sign
in
the
foreground.
these
signs,
billboards,
laundromat
signs,
fast
food
signs
are
located
not...
they
are
not
attached
to
public
property
but
they
all
are
placed
over
public
property
and
certainly
within
public
view.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
it
is
our
position
that
the
opposite
is
true
that
los
angeles
may
very
well
be
able
to
pass
a
comprehensive
plan
to
address
the
visual
pollution
problem
in
los
angeles
and
take
into
consideration
the
visual
impact
of
signs
on
private
property
and
public
property.
it
has
not
done
so
and
nothing
in
this
case
suggests
it
has.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
in
the
public
square?
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
it
would
depend
on
the
public
square.
if
the
public
square
were
not
a
park
or
an
aesthetically
sensitive--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
am
trying
to
conjure
one
in
los
angeles.
[laughter]
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
your
honor--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--the
answer
depends
on
whether
that
square
or
park
is
aesthetically
so
sensitive
that
its
character
would
be
destroyed
by
the
placement
of
signs
on
or
around
it.
if
the
character
would
not
be
impaired
then
i
think
that
we
have
the
right
to
post
a
sign
on
or
near
that
public
square.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
if
the
character
is
substantially
impaired.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
had
more
time
to
think
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
think
that
would
be
permissible,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
that
would
be
permissible.
i
do
not
think
a
sign
could
be
posted.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
do
not
believe
any
sign
can
be
placed
on
the
court
house
or
on
the
steps
even
for
a
period
of
24
or
48
hours,
but
if
there
are
public
utility
poles
that
line
the
street
in
front
of
the
court
house
and
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
decided
in
grace
that
persons
can
walk
around
the
court
house--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
suspect
it
would
not
be,
your
honor,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
signs
would
substantially
impair
the
character
of
the
place.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
not
any
sign,
no.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
reasonable
regulation
is
quite
appropriate.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
no,
your
honor.
again,
i
believe
that
reasonable
regulations
are
appropriate.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
do
not
take
that
position
absolutely,
your
honor.
if
the
city
had
made
such
findings
it
may
very
well
be
within
its
right
to
do
that.
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
findings
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
believe
the
city
can
regulate
against
that
type
of
abuse.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
think
it
should,
yes.
in
san
francisco,
for
example,
the
ordinance
reads
that
only
one
sign
for
any
one
candidate
can
be
posted
on
a
public
utility
pole.
that
is
the
answer
i
believe
to
that
question.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
i
hope
i
am
defending
the--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
no,
your
honor.
i
take
both
positions,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
as
an
overbroad
restraint
because
it
prohibits
the
placement
of
signs
on
the
objects
listed
which
include
the
wires--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--no,
your
honor.
our
basic
position
is
that
as
interpreted
by
los
angeles--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--no,
again
the
distinction
is
whether
the
sign
is
allowed
to
be
placed
on
the
cross
bar
out
of
harm's
way
or
whether
the
ordinance
prohibits
the
posting
of
signs
on
the
pole
itself.
if
the
ordinance
did--
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
--i
do
not
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
wayne
s.
canterbury
if
it
is
i
do
not
see
it.
