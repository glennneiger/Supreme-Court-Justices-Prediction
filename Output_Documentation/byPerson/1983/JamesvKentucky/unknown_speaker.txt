unknown
speaker
was
there
anything
to
prevent
counsel,
when
the
court
ruled,
to
say
i
intend
my
motion
in
the
sense
of
an
instruction,
an
admonition
or
an
instruction,
in
the
alternative,
treating
them,
even
though
they
are
not,
treating
them
as
though
they
are
synonyms?
unknown
speaker
nothing
preventing
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
emphasize
one,
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
there
were
eight
of
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hectus,
was
the
defendant
in
the
case
below
represented
by
different
counsel
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
counsel,
for
whatever
reason,
did
not
request
a
written
or
present
the
court
with
a
written
instruction
in
this
regard?
unknown
speaker
and
kentucky
law,
i
take
it,
is
perfectly
clear
that
only
written
instructions
will
be
given
and
that
counsel
has
to
present
written
instructions?
unknown
speaker
and
in
kentucky
law...
all
right.
and
in
kentucky
law
there
has
been
a
distinction
made,
has
there
not,
between
instructions
and
admonitions?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
a
judge's
ruling
on
that
score
in
that
stage
is
to
prevent
error
getting
into
the
case
right
at
the
outset
because
of
the
view
that
that
is
a
good
way,
a
good
way
to
call
attention
to
the
failure
to
testify
by
having
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
it
when
they
are
picking
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
at
what
stage
did
your
client
request
the
admonition
to
the
jury,
mr.
hectus?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
his
request
for
an
instruction
had
been
given...
for
an
admonition
had
been
granted
by
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
would
have
admonished
the
jury
presumably
at
the
next
time
the
jury
was
brought
in,
which
might
have--
unknown
speaker
--and
are
there
written
instructions
given
to
the
jury
in
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
jury
takes
the--
unknown
speaker
--under
your
client's
request
the
admonition,
being
oral,
would
not
have
gone
in
writing.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
the
trial
court
was
obligated
to
determine
whether
the
lawyer's
request
was
inadvertent?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
come
back
to
the
practice
in
kentucky.
is
it
not
unusual
for
counsel
not
to
make
a
written
request
for
an
instruction?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
makes
its
own
instructions
without
any
help
from
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
discuss
if
there
is
nothing
in
writing?
unknown
speaker
was
this
particular
question
of
admonition
discussed
in
this
conference?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
clear
from
the
record,
to
me,
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
did
counsel
except
on
the
record
to
the
overruling
by
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
in
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
actually,
if
one
were
looking
at
the
thing
from
some
other
planet,
spare,
skeletal
instructions
might
be
better
than
these
convoluted
things
you
see
some
courts
give
where,
you
know,
the
presumption
of
innocence
takes
fifteen
pages
to
define,
and
the
jurors
are
all
asleep
at
the
end
of
the
definitions.
unknown
speaker
and
in
some
places,
years
ago,
the
instructions
were
in
effect
do
what
you
want
to,
i
mean,
do
what
you
think
is
just.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hectus,
before
you
do
that,
let
me
just
ask
one
question
similar
to
the
one
justice
powell
asked.
as
i
read
the
appendix,
the
critical
statement
is
the
defendant
requests,
in
the
present
test,
that
an
admonition
be
given
to
the
jury
that
no
emphasis
be
given
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
which
was
overruled,
sort
of
internally
inconsistent,
but
you
read
that
as
indicating
that
in
the
instruction
conference,
such
a
request
was
made
and
overruled.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
then
immediately
after
that
happened,
he
went
ahead
and
gave
the
instructions.
so
if
the
admonition
had
been
given,
it
would
have
been
given
right
in,
as
part
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
and
the
oral
admonition
and
the
oral
instructions
are
given
consecutively,
right
together.
unknown
speaker
right,
okay.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
in
kentucky
practice,
is
there
just
one
copy
of
the
written
instructions
that
goes
into
the
jury
room,
or
does
each
juror
get
a
copy?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
as
far
as
you
know,
do
many
states
have
this
practice?
unknown
speaker
of
written
instructions
going
into
the
jury
room?
unknown
speaker
well,
an
alibi
witness
would
contradict,
too,
or
ten
alibi
witnesses
if
he
was
off
at
a
football
game
with
them.
so
your
statement
is
not
accurate
that
only,
only
the
defendant
could
contradict.
unknown
speaker
did
he
bring
in
any
alibi
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
did
he
bring
any
alibi
witnesses
saying
he
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
such
witnesses
could
contradict.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
a
fact-finder
or
a
judge
or
anyone
else
in
the
courtroom
would
assume
the
reason
they
didn't
bring
alibi
witnesses
is
because
there
weren't
any.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
a
great
many
people
think
that's
what
juries
do,
no
matter
what
any
judge
instructs
or
admonishes
them.
unknown
speaker
nor
does
griffin.
nor
does
griffin,
nor
does
griffin.
nor
chapman.
would
you
want
carter
to
depend
on
such
a
weak
reed
as
griffin?
unknown
speaker
is
your
basic
argument,
mr.
hectus,
that
your
client
was
entitled
to
an
instruction
because
he
had
requested
something
almost
like
an
instruction
or
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
admonition
because
he
had
requested
an
admonition?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
on
that
count?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
separately
as
to
some?
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
on?
unknown
speaker
what
page
are
you
on?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you,
ms.
warren,
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
back
part?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
if
we
were
to--
--is
it
not...
i'm
sorry--
--if
we
were
to
treat
the
request
for
an
admonition
as
it
was
phrased,
to
wit,
for
an
admonition,
would
it
be
a
proper
subject
under
kentucky
law
for
an
admonition,
the
instruction
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
do
i
judge
from
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
the
admonitions
are
really
something
that
occurs
during
the
testimony
of
witnesses--
unknown
speaker
--such
as
the
objection
is
sustained
and
the
jury
admonished
to
disregard
it,
that
it
really
fulfills
quite
a
different
function,
it
isn't
just
an
oral
instruction?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
in
kentucky
practice
on
may
have
oral
instructions,
may
he
not,
if
he
asks
for
them?
unknown
speaker
is
quite
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
living
in
1912
and--
unknown
speaker
--would
that
require
waiver
by
the
state
as
well
as
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
material
that
you
called
our
attention
to
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
that,
as
i
read
it,
it
really
is
just
a
repetition
of
the
colloquy
that
is
found
on
page
11
of
your
brief
where
the
defendant
merely
said
the
defendant
requested
an
admonition
be
given
to
the
jury
that
no
emphasis
be
given
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
which
was
overruled.
that's
the
same
statement
that's
quoted
in
the
other
brief,
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
so
do
we
have
anything
in
the
record
other
than
that
one
sentence
about
what
really
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some--
unknown
speaker
--no
quotation
in
the
transcript?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
reading
of
this
as
something
that
was
requested
during
the
conference
on
instructions?
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
that
it
was
asked
by
the
defendant's
lawyer
as
something
to
be
given
to
the
jury
along
with
the
written
instructions.
wouldn't
that
be
true,
because
the
evidence
was
all
over.
it's
the
only
time
he
could
have
done
it.
unknown
speaker
immediately
preceding.
unknown
speaker
immediately
preceding
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
because
the
instructions
were
given
right
after
that
comment.
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
been
error
as
a
matter
of
kentucky
law
for
the
judge
to
have
given
the
admonition
he
had
requested?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
judge
orally
tells
the
jury
something
that
he
doesn't
put
in
writing,
he
commits
error?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
rather
strange
procedure.
unknown
speaker
ms.
warren.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
decision
of
the
kentucky
supreme
court
says
that
an
oral
request
for
instruction
is
not
appropriate?
unknown
speaker
oh,
well--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
don't
have
to
write
out
anything,
he
just
has
to
ask
him
to
give
an
instruction.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
find
this
record
very
confusing.
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
was
said
when
and
where,
and
it
is
a
very
incomplete,
uninformative
record,
it
seems
to
me.
i
know
you
didn't
prepare
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
one
element.
the
whole
appendix,
i
haven't
looked
at
the
record
beyond
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
my
confusion
about
kentucky
law
for
a
minute?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
you
to
tell
me
that
it
would
be
error
in
kentucky
to
give
an
oral
instruction
on
the
law.
unknown
speaker
but
could
he
not
waive
a...
your
brief
at
pages
24
and
25
quote
the
law
as
i
understand
it
to
say
that
if
it
is
clear
that
the
defendant
was
satisfied
to
have
the
instruction
be
given
orally,
that
there
is
no
error.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any
authority
in
kentucky
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
defendant
asks
for
one
oral
instruction,
as
he
did
here,
or
you
call
it
an
admonition,
and
the
judge
gives
it,
that
that
would
be
error?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
no
consistent
body
of
state
law
that
supports
that.
unknown
speaker
the
instruction
should
be
in
writing
unless
the
defendant
asks
for
it
to
be
oral.
unknown
speaker
and
here
he
asked
for
it
to
be
oral.
unknown
speaker
but
can
you
really
call
this
an
ingenious
defense
remedy,
saying
he
wants
this
particular
admonition?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
the
judge
give
it?
i
just
don't
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
if
the
judge
said
you
can
have
it
in
writing
if
you
want
it
but
you
can't
have
it
orally.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
you
are
assuming
he
must
have
said
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
kentucky
do
you...
i
take
it
that
you
regard
the
term
"admonition"
as
being
something
of
less
force
than
an
instruction.
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
technical
differences
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
in
kentucky
a
juror
or
a
jury
can
have
greater
latitude
in
disregarding
an
admonition
than
an
instruction?
