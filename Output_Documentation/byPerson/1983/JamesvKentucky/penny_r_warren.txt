ms.
penny
r.
warren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
to
address
the
suggestion
that
this
was
an
inadvertent
request
for
an
admonition
when
in
fact
the
trial
counsel
meant
to
ask
for
an
instruction.
i
believe
that
the
case
was
practiced
throughout
in
the
kentucky
supreme
court
as
though
all
he
asked
for
was
an
admonition,
and
that's
what
he
intended.
in
the
state
court
brief,
which
is
reproduced
in
our
appendix,
the
claim
is
that
the
trial
court
erred
by
failure
to
admonish--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--pardon
me?
ms.
penny
r.
warren
on
page
1a
in
the
addendum,
your
honor,
and
this
is
petitioner's
brief
before
the
state
court...
the
trial
court
refused
to
admonish
the
jury,
and
then
the
first
sentence,
appellant,
by
counsel,
requested
that
an
admonition
be
given,
and
on
page
2a
at
the
top,
appellant
submits
that
the
requested
admonition
is
now
constitutionally
mandated,
and
in
their
footnote
that
trial
counsel
apparently
requested
an
admonition
rather
than
a
written
instruction.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
respondent's
brief.
i
apologize.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
sir,
the
addendum
reproduces
the
state
court
brief.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
justice
o'connor,
in
kentucky
the
term
"admonition"
means
only
an
oral
comment
by
the
judge
for
two
purposes:
one,
a
curative
purpose
to
eliminate
from
the
jury's
consideration
evidence
that
was
improperly
presented
to
them,
the
classic
example
being
incriminating
impeachment
evidence,
to
limit
their
consideration
only
for
impeachment
purposes;
and
the
other
purpose
of
an
admonition
is
to
guide
the
jury
as
to
their
duties,
you
are
not
to
speak
with
others
outside
of
the
courtroom.
there's
approximately
60
years
of
case
law
in
kentucky,
three
or
four
cases
over
that
timeframe,
fairly
clearly
establishing
this
distinction,
and
that
instructions
are
written
and
are
not
admonitions.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
correct.
it
is
not
an
oral
instruction,
and
kentucky
case
law
i
believe
is
very
clear
on
that
point.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
the
case
law
on
that
is
quite
old
and--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--quite
old.
i
belief
the
case
law
is
something
like
1912,
but
of
course,
it
is
still
the
law
in
kentucky,
and
we
acknowledge
that
it
is.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
my
comment
was
that
the...
now
the
rules
of
procedure
say,
you
know,
shall
be
written,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
kentucky
court,
after
70
years
of
experience
with
the
written
instructions,
would
now
say
that
they
may
be
waived,
but
in
fact
they
do,
and
it
is
the
law
in
kentucky
today,
you
may
waive
written...
if
there
is
a
clear
waiver...
and
all
instructions
are
given
orally,
all
are
given
alike.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
according
to
current
case
law,
it
appears
to
be
only
the
defendant--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--yes.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
sir,
but--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--i
believe
we
do
have
some
inferences.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
no,
we
do
not
have
an
expression.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
no
quotation.
this
isn't--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--i
believe
it
was
requested
during
the
conference
because
of
the
choice
of
terms,
which
was
overruled,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
it
would
have
been
an
oral
comment
by
the
court
preceding
the
reading
of
the
instructions.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
and
then
the
instructions--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
also
would
note
that
in
the
discussion...
i'm
sorry,
in
the
record,
we
have
some
inferences
of
experienced
attorney.
i
am
looking
particularly
at
the
discussion
at
the
very
beginning
of
trial
where
he,
on
pages
13
through
17
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
he
is
arguing
with
the
trial
judge
a
rather
complex
point
concerning
our
persistent
felony
offender
statute,
and
the
issue
there
is
whether
the
term
"probation"
qualifies
as
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
purposes
of
kentucky
law.
an
attorney
who
understands
the
importance
of
words
and
the
distinction
between
words,
an
attorney
who
throughout
this
record
has
planned
his
strategy
and
who
anticipates
the
fact
that
the
defendant
will
not
testify,
and
then
when
he
quoted,
he
repeated
on
the
record
what
had
occurred
before,
he
repeated
it
for
purposes
of
preserving
the
record,
he
did
not
choose
a
common
term
such
as
i
want
you
to
tell
the
jury
or
i
want
the
jury
to
be
advised,
he
chose
a
word
of
art,
and
we
submit
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
words
of
art,
and
there
are
strategic
reasons
for
not
wanting
written--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--yes,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
because
instructions
must
be
given
in
writing;
this
is
an
instructional--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
oral
instructions,
separate,
isolated
oral
instruction
is
not
permitted
in
kentucky.
i
would
also
note
for
the
court
that
we
submit
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
not
an
attempt
to
apply
carter
but
an
attempt
to
expand
carter,
and
i
believe
petitioner
in
his
brief
makes
that
rather
clear
on
several
occasions.
he
says
that
the
carter
case
mandates
both
admonitions
and
instructions.
he...
under
the,
using
the
term
"functional
equivalency"
says
that
we
are
to
focus
o
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
defense
attorney's
request
for
protecting
a
fifth
amendment
right
and
that
carter
mandates
that
a
state
provide
any
of
various
forms
of
relief
that
serve
that
underlying
purpose.
he
acknowledges
that
an
instruction
pursuant
to
carter
was
available
to
him.
again,
in
state
court
the
acknowledgement
was
that
it
was
not
requested,
the
written
instruction
was
not
requested,
nor
after
he
said
that
the
judge
had
denied
his
request
for
admonition
did
he
turn
around
and
say,
well,
okay,
judge,
then
i
would
like
the
written
instruction.
he
did
not
pursue
any
alternative
form
of
relief--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--yes,
sir.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
no,
your
honor.
oral
requests
are
appropriate.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
oral
instructions,
a
separate,
isolated
oral
instruction
or
an
instruction
given
by
way
of
an
admonition
are
not
appropriate,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
good
practice
is
to
prepare
written
instructions
so
that
there
is
something
to
discuss
in
that
charging
conference,
but
no,
it
is
not
required.
you
may
do
it
by
motion.
and
again,
we
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
this
case
because
we
do
not
know
the
discussion
that
occurred.
defense
counsel
chose
not
to
put
it
on
the
record,
and
we
don't
know
precisely
what
was--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--yes,
sir.
are
you
speaking
of
this
particular
segment
of
it
as
just
isolated
from
context?
ms.
penny
r.
warren
the
position
of
kentucky
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant
had
available
to
him
a
constitutionally
adequate
vehicle
to
protect
his
fifth
amendment
right,
but
now
he
insists
that
he
has
a
right
to
ride
in
every
other
car
going
in
the
same
direction
so
long
as
it
serves
that
underlying
purpose.
we
submit
that
carter
was
not
to
be
the
beginning
of
litigation
on
this
subject
but
in
fact
establish
a
prophylactic
rule
to
bring
to
an
end
this
type
of
litigation.
carter
closed
the
circle
on
this
issue
in
a
manner
that
provides
every
defendant
in
all
jurisdictions
to
have
available
a
constitutionally
adequate
safeguard
upon
request.
petitioner
here
would
initiate
an
endless
spiral
of
litigation
based
on
strategic
decisions
of
functional
equivalency.
the
line
of
reasoning
ignores
the
nature
of
the
request,
it
ignores
any
rules
applicable
to
it,
and
ignores
any
state
interest
that
might
be
involved,
and
instead,
focuses
on
the
underlying
purpose.
if
carter
mandates
alternative
forms
of
relief
under
this
analysis,
as
james
states
it,
functional
equivalency,
we
submit
then
carter
would
also
mandate
that
the
defendant
be
permitted
to
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
to
say
that
there
shall
be
no
adverse
inference
from
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
any
number
of
alternatives
would
then
become
functional
equivalents,
i
choose
not
to
do
it
this
way,
i
prefer
another.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
sir.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
a
defendant
may
waive
all
written
instructions
under
kentucky
law,
and
all--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--that
applies
to
all...
all
instructions
may
be
given
orally
or
all
written,
but
we
found
no
authority
that
would
suggest
that
you
should
isolate
one
and
pull
it
out.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
there
is
not
a
case
on
that
point,
your
honor.
this
is
the
first
time
this
issue
has
been
presented.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
there
is
a
body
of
state
law
that
says
that
there
must
be
a
clear
waiver--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--waives.
then
again,
in--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--he
asked
for
this
particular...
he
asked
for
an
admonition
which
is
a
term
of
art
in
kentucky
meaning
an
oral
comment,
not
an
instruction,
but
an
oral
comment
by
the
court.
again,
strategically,
we
think
he
wanted
less
emphasis
on
this
particular
subject,
not
before
the
jury,
not
in
writing
to
be
read
over
and
over,
but
to
have
been
commented
upon
and
passed
by.
there
is
no
provision
in
kentucky
law
for
an
admonition
on
an
instructional
issue.
kentucky
would
also
note
that
this
type
of
functional
equivalency
argument
would
also
apply
to
other
constitutional
rights
and
to
other
instructional
issues.
why
not
have
a
defendant
throw
the
burden
of
proof
instruction
out
and
ask
that
it
be
treated
differently?
if
all
instructions
are
given
orally,
then
ask
that
that
be
given
written,
again,
we
would
turn
defense
attorneys'
strategic
decisions
into
rulemaking
organs,
the
state
court
procedure.
this
court
rejected
a
similar
notion
in
lakeside,
and
we
request
that
it
be
rejected
here.
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
use
carter
but,
in
fact,
an
attempt
to
misuse
carter,
and
it
would
place
judges
in
a
posture
of
forever
being
subject
to
hindsight
interpretation
as
to
what
is
the
functional
equivalent.
we
urge
this
court
to
hold
that
carter
means
what
it
says,
an
admonition...
i'm
sorry,
an
instruction
must
be
made
available...
terrible
slip
of
the
tongue...
must
be
made
available
upon
request,
and
carter
is
not
to
be
expanded
to
include
all
ingenious
defense
remedies
that
they
may
desire.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
in
that
it
was--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--your
honor,
i
am
at
a
disadvantage,
and
we
are
all
at
a
disadvantage
because
we
do
not
know
what
was
discussed
before.
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
the
trial
court--
ms.
penny
r.
warren
--i
believe
the...
i'm
sorry.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor,
and
again,
during
that
early
discussion
when
there
was
some
confusion
about
what
the
defense
attorney
wanted,
when
we
were
talking
about
the
persistent
felony
offender
issue,
when
the
judge
had
some
confusion,
he
clarified
and
he
repeatedly
asked
defense
counsel.
we
do
not
have
any
of
that
discussion,
we
do
not
have
the
clarification.
i
would
submit
there
is
an
inference
that
he
understood
defense
counsel
wanted
exactly
what
he
asked
for,
an
admonition.
that's
the
only
inference
that
we
can
draw
from
it.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
it
serves
very
different
purposes
and
also
is
not
that
directive
on
the
law
to
be
applied
by
the
jury
in
their
deliberations.
it
is
a
comment
by
the
court
during
the
course
of
trial.
ms.
penny
r.
warren
they
certainly
must
follow
the
advice
and
caution
of
the
trial
court,
but
i
believe
in
kentucky
that
all
instructions
are
presented
in
a
unified
manner,
whether
it
be
all
oral
or
all
written,
and
in
my
practice,
i
have
never
seen
any
request
for
an
oral
instruction
at
all.
they
are
always
written,
and
they
are
submitted
in
the
same
way
and
then
made
available
to
the
jury.
if
this
court
should
decide
that
carter
does
compel
an
admonition
in
addition
to
an
instruction,
then
kentucky
requests
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
error
were
harmless.
the
state
court
did
not
decide
that
issue
because
it
determined
that
there
was
no
error.
any
discussion
of
harmless
error
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court
would
have
been
advisory
at
that
point.
petition
suggests
that
the
kentucky
court
would
not
hold
the
error
harmless
and
there
is
no
need
to
remand,
but
we
would
respectfully
disagree.
the
charges
against
james
were
for
rape,
burglary
and
receiving
stolen
property,
arising
from
incidents
within
a
two-week
time
frame
and
all
involving
the
same
victim.
the
defense
as
to
the
rape
was
basically
mistaken
identity
or
fabrication,
and
similar
defenses,
mistaken
identity
or
no
involvement
or
alibi.
defense
counsel
portrayed
the
victim
as
seeking
an
excuse
for
her
absence
that
afternoon
to
satisfy
her
employer.
witnesses
were
presented
to
argue
that
had
the
events
taken
place
as
she
testified,
they
would
have
been
seen
crossing
the
short
yard,
and
in
fact,
petitioner
was
seen
leaving
his
apartment
at
some
time
when
the
victim
testified
that
she
was
being
held
inside
at
gunpoint.
this
testimony
of
the
defense
witnesses
was
based
on
recollection
of
common
events
on
routine
days
many
months
earlier,
and
the
testimony
as
to
the
timing
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
the
victim
was
not
seen.
the
testimony
on
the
timeframes
put
mr.
bates
in
the
basement
at
about
the
same
time
the
yard
crossing
occurred,
and
his
statement
was
that
he
stayed
out
in
the
yard
sometimes
until
four.
the
victim
said
she
left
at
4:30.
so
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
that
she
was
not
seen.
there
were
not
the
numerous
adverse
comments
as
there
were
in
chapman,
nor
was
there
an
adverse
instruction,
and
counsel
repeatedly...
defense
counsel
repeatedly
said
there
is
no
evidence
on
this
issue.
in
cases
such
as
this
where
there
is
merely
a
possibility
of
misinterpretation,
we
submit
the
weight
of
evidence
is
more
significant.
the
prosecution
presented
an
unequivocal
identification
of
the
victim.
james'
positive
fingerprint
was
found
on
the
back
door
of
the
house,
and
i
believe
the
victim's
testimony
was
that
he
had
come
to
use
the
phone,
and
the
trial
record
reflects
the
phone
is
in
the
front
room.
also,
mr.
james,
i
believe
the
testimony
reflects,
was
six
feet
eleven
inches
tall,
and
this
fingerprint
was
on
the
bottom
inside
of
a
glass
storm
door
after
it
was
pushed
out.
also,
there
were
prompt
reports
to
the
police
corroborating
the
victim's
testimony,
and
there
was
medical
evidence.
mr.
james
had
in
his
possession
within
a
few
hours
of
the
rape
cloth
strips
that
were
impregnated
with
the
saliva
of
a
blood
type...
a
secretor
with
a
blood
type
similar
to
that
of
the
victim's,
and
also
in
his
possession
was
the
pistol
stolen
from
her
apartment
two
weeks
earlier.
we
believe
it
is
clear
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury
would
have
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
kentucky
supreme
court
decision
finding
that
there
was
no
