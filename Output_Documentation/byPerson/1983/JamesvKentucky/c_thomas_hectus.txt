mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky.
the
issue
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
was
constitutionally
required
to
admonish
the
jury
that
they
could
draw
no
adverse
inference
from
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
at
his
state
criminal
trial.
the
kentucky
supreme
court
apparently
applied
a
procedural
bar
to
the
relief
requested,
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
carter
v.
kentucky
that
although
an
instruction
was
constitutionally
compelled,
an
admonition
was
not.
implicitly,
the
kentucky
supreme
court
also
ruled
that
as
a
matter
of
substantive
constitutional
criminal
procedure,
that
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
an
admonition
regardless
of
kentucky
evidentiary
rules.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
nothing
requiring
counsel
from
asking
for
relief
in
the
alternative.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
nothing
preventing
him,
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
preventing
the
trial
court
from
performing
its
obligation
that
once
it
was
put
on
notice
that
the
defendant
wanted
some
sort
of
jury
guidance,
no
matter
how
that
jury
guidance
is
phrased,
whether
as
an
admonition,
an
oral,
authoritative
communication
to
the
jury,
or
as
an
instruction
in
writing
containing
the
law
of
the
case,
certainly
i
think
the
judge
was
on
notice
as
to
the
relief
that
the
defendant
wanted.
if
he
thought
it
was
improper,
i
think
he
had
fair
notice
under
the
kentucky
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
go
ahead
and
give
the
instruction
that
is
also
mandated
under
those
same
rules
upon
timely
request.
i
think
that
this
issue
has
great
importance
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
tried
on
three
separate
and
distinct
charges.
he
was
tried
for
receiving
stolen
property,
a
handgun
that
had
been
stolen
from
the
victim.
he
was
tried
for
a
subsequent
burglary.
and
he
was
also
tried
for
a
still
later
rape,
all
of
the
same
victim.
petitioner
presented
no
evidence
in
his
behalf
as
to
either
the
receiving
stolen
property
or
as
to
the
burglary.
he
presented
only
evidence
as
to
his
apparent
lack
of
presence
at
the
scene
at
the
time
of
the
rape.
so
in
other
words,
at
the
time
this
case
went
to
the
jury
on
the
receiving
stolen
property
charge,
the
only
thing
that
the
jury
had
before
them
was
evidence
that
he
was
in
fact
in
possession
of
a
handgun
which
had
been
stolen.
there
was
no
evidence
showing
that
possession
was
in
any
way
knowing,
and
i
think
in
that
particular
case
the
absence
of
the
admonition
was
critical.
as
to
the
burglary,
the
only
evidence
of
the
burglary
of
may
1,
1981
of
the
victim's
residence
linking
the
petitioner
to
that
residence
was
one
fingerprint
on
the
inside
of
a
door
panel
at
petitioner's
apartment.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
i
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference
depending
upon
where
those
fingerprints
were.
i
think
the
locations
of
certain
fingerprints
are
more
incriminating
than
the
location
of
the
fingerprint
in
this
case.
in
this
case
the
victim
testified
that
petitioner
had
been
in
her
apartment
on
several
other
occasions.
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
somebody
entering
or
leaving
an
apartment
might
leave
their
fingerprint
on
the
inside
of
a
glass
door
panel
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
a
safe
breaking
case
where
a
defendant's
fingerprints
are
found
on
the
inside
of
a
safe
to
which
he
had
no
legal
or
proper
access.
i
think
in
this
case
that
fingerprint
was
certainly
neutral
as
to
incriminating
the
defendant.
the
defendant
had
asked
for
a
severance
of
that
particular
charge
from
the
other
charges.
that
severance
was
denied,
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
should
consider
in
considering
the
entire
context
of
this
case.
we
are
not
merely
speaking
to
petitioner's
rape
conviction
here
which
was
subsequently
enhanced
in
terms
of
sentencing
to
a
life
sentence
on
the
basis
of
his
being
a
persistent
felony
offender,
which--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
no,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
trial
court
has
an
obligation
to
instruct
the
jury
in
writing.
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
because
it
is
not
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
defendant
has
to
tender
written
instructions
in
order
to
preserve
that
issue.
kentucky
rule
of
criminal
procedure
specifically
provides
that
the
defendant
can
request
an
instruction
or
by
motion
request
an
instruction
or
object
to
an
instruction.
certainly
here
there
was
an
adequate
motion
made.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
absolutely.
an
admonition
has
been
defined
in
kentucky
law
as
any
authoritative
communication
of
the
court
to
the
jury
regarding
their
duty
or
conduct
as
jurors.
i
certainly
think
that
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
an
admonition
with
regard
to
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
the
use
to
which
the
jury
should
put
that
has
to
do
with
their
duty
as
jurors.
so
i
think
that
we
come
squarely
within
the
terms
of
an
admonition.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
is
well
aware
that
oftentimes
when
griffin
errors
are
committed
by
prosecutors
with
regard
to
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
the
appropriate
relief
is
for
the
court
to
admonish
the
jury
that
they
can't
consider
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
i
certainly
don't
think
that
it
would
be
logical
to
have
to
wait
for
an
error
of
that
magnitude
before
you
are
entitled
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
to
the
relief
that
was
requested
in
this
case.
if
i
could
get
back
procedurally,
there
are
some
other
important
points
that
i
think
the
court
ought
to
consider
with
regard
to
the
overall
context
of
the
request
for
the
instruction,
its
importance
to
this
case,
and
later
with
regard
to
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky's
assertion
of
harmless
error.
one,
the
judge
did
overrule
defendant's
motion
for
severance.
that
was
critical
later
on
due
to
the
extreme
paucity
of
the
commonwealth's
evidence
of
the
burglary.
furthermore,
the
prosecutor
noted
his
intention
early
on,
prior
to
presentation
of
any
evidence,
that
he
was
going
to
impeach
the
defendant
with
a
prior
forgery
conviction.
the
defendant
in
the
persistent
felony
offender
stage
of
this
trial,
contested
that
that
was
in
fact
a
felony
conviction
and
asserted
that
it
was
a
misdemeanor
conviction.
i
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
in
this
case
that
because
the
judge
was
going
to
allow
that
forgery
conviction
which
he
contested
to
be
used
as
impeachment,
that
that
was
a
consideration
in
his
failure
to
testify,
so
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
reason,
a
likely
inference
for
his
failure
to
testify
that
is
unrelated
to
guilt
or
innocence,
and
i
think
that
that
is
an
important
consideration.
during
the
voir
dire,
the
defense
counsel
was
precluded
from
fully
exploring
with
the
jury
their
feelings,
their
attitudes
about
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
if
in
fact
he
did
not
testify.
defense
counsel
was
allowed
to
inquire
as
to
one
juror's
attitude.
after
exploring
that
attitude
with
the
juror,
defense
counsel
attempted
to
explore
the
rest
of
the
venire's
attitude
toward
that
particular
consideration--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--that
may
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
in
this
point,
the
trial
judge's
response
to
his
attempt
to
do
that
was
that
the
jurors
have
already
been
instructed
that
they
are
to
decide
this
case
on
the
law
and
the
evidence.
this
court
specifically
repudiated
that
sort
of
admonition
or
instruction
in
carter
as
being
a
substitute
for
a
full
explanation
as
to
the
defendant's
right
to
not
testify.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence,
and
apparently
during
the
instruction
conference.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
presumably,
immediately
prior
to
his
giving
the
law
of
the
case
in
instruction.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
yes,
as
an--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--the
normal
practice
is
to
give
a
copy
of
the
written
instructions
to
jurors.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
assuming
that
the
request
for
an
admonition
wasn't
an
inadvertent
use
of
the
word,
or
request
for
an
instruction,
yes,
then
i
assume
that
he
wanted
them
to
be
orally
admonished
right
then
and
there
prior
to
the
instructions.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
not
at
all.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i
think
that
the
request
for
an
admonition
in
this
case
is
a
perfectly
logical
request.
if
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
instruction,
as
the
kentucky
supreme
court
agreed,
then
certainly
he's
entitled
to
less
than
what
this
court
has
mandated,
assuming
this
court
finds
that
an
admonition
is
in
any
way
less
than
an
instruction.
i
don't
think
that
that's
true
because
i
think
this
court's
concern
in
this
area
has
been
with
jury
guidance,
and
i
think
that
the
concept
of
jury
guidance
includes
either
an
admonition
or
instruction,
and--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--i
don't
think
that's
unusual
at
all,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
usually
during
the
instruction
conference,
instructions
are
discussed,
and
most
instructions,
from
my
practice
in
kentucky,
including
some--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--well,
for
example,
lesser
included
offenses,
whether
or
not--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--apparently
it
was.
the--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--the
record
apparently
was
not
made
during
the
instruction
conference,
but
when
the
proceedings
went
back
on
the
record,
defense
counsel
indicated
that
there
had
been
a
request
for
an
admonition
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify,
and
the
apparent
request
for
a
no
inference
admonition.
there
was
also
indication
from
defense
counsel
that
that
had
been
overruled.
there
was
no
response
from
either
the
court
or
to
the...
or
by
the
prosecutor
as
to
defense
counsel's
assertion
of
that.
i
am
sure
had
that
not
occurred,
that
there
would
have
been
some
response.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
there
is
no
requirement
in
kentucky
for
exceptions.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
the
reason
i
think
that
the
whole
notion
of
instructions
and
the
request
for
the
admonition
in
kentucky
is
not
really
important
is
because
the
kentucky
practice,
as
this
court
is
aware
i
think
from
cases
like
taylor
v.
kentucky,
is
to
give
very
spartan
and
skeletal
instructions,
in
this
court's
own
language,
they
give
very
brief
instructions
which
have
only
to
do
with
the
elements
of
the
crime,
which
come
right
out
of
the
statute
book.
in
response
to
this
court's
mandate
that
on
request
the
courts
in
kentucky
give
an
instruction
on
the
presumption
of
innocence,
the
response
of
the
kentucky
courts
has
been
to
instruct
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
that's
it.
there
is
no
fleshing
out
of
instructions
in
kentucky.
i
think
when
compared
to
federal
instructions,
the
difference
is
extreme.
while
this
court
has
not
constitutionally
condemned
that,
i
think
it
is
a
factor
to
consider.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
i
would
respectfully
assert
that
i
would
prefer
the
fleshed
cut
sort.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
nonetheless,
i
think
that
now
there
are
at
least
certain
constitutional
prerequisites.
this
court
indicated
in
carter
that
the
trial
judge
had
an
obligation
upon
request
to
diminish
the
possibility
of
the
jury
drawing
any
adverse
inference
from
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
if
i
could
proceed
on
with
some
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
which
i
also
think
has
to
do
both
with
the
consideration
of
whether
this
should
have
been
given
and
the
consideration,
given
that
it
wasn't,
whether
it
was
harmless
error--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--i
think
that
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
per
the
attorney
general's
office
have
assumed
that
that
was
the
state
of
affairs.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
prior
to
instructions.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
prior
to
instructions,
right.
and
in
fact,
the
court
reads
the
instructions,
as
is
the
federal
practice,
and
then
would
give
the
instructions.
so
the
only
thing...
the
defendant
would
have
been
prejudiced,
in
fact,
by
not
having
that
included
in
the
written
instructions,
to
the
jury,
but
certainly
this
court
has
indicated
it's
unwilling
to
presume
that
jurors
do
not
listen
to
the
admonitions
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
assuming
that
there
are
any
admonitions
to
give.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
moving
on
with
the
evidence,
after
ms.
richardson
testified--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--there
is
not
a
rule
on
it.
in
my
experience,
i
have
only
seen
that
happen,
it
is
basically
according
to
a
judge's
preference,
there
is
no
rule
prohibiting
it
and
there
is
no
rule
mandating
it.
most
judges
will
only
send
back
one
copy
of
the
instructions.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
with
regard
to
the...
with
regard
to
the
instructions?
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
i
don't
think
that
it's
novel.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
unusual.
two
state
police
officers,
trooper
john
sparks
and
detective
claude
owen,
very
briefly
testified
as
to
the
arrest
of
the
defendant.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
both
those
officers,
in
response
to
questions
by
the
prosecutor,
made
statements
in
front
of
the
jury
as
to
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
trooper
sparks
specifically
said
in
response
to
a
question,
after
advising
the
defendant
of
his
rights,
he
did
not
make
any
statement
whatsoever
regarding
anything.
i
would
submit
that
that's
an
error
in
violation
of
doyle
v.
ohio
that
is
unpreserved,
but
i
certainly
think
the
court
should
consider
it
in
deciding
whether
or
not
this
error
is
harmless.
detective
owen
also
testified
that
the
defendant
made
no
statement
upon
his
arrest.
this
was
a
post-arrest,
post-miranda
comment
on
silence.
detective
courtney
went
on
to
make
a
statement
that
the
only
statement
that
he
recalled
the
defendant
making
was
that
he
didn't
own
a
gym
bag.
of
course,
detective
courtney,
detective
owen
and
trooper
sparks
were
all
present
at
the
time
and
neither
trooper
sparks
or
detective
owen
recalled
that
statement.
mr.
evans
testified
as
to
the
fingerprint
on
the
inside
of
the
glass.
of
course,
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
either
incriminating
or
exculpatory,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
evans
did
state,
though,
that
fingerprints
on
the
inside
of
buildings
car
remain
for
years,
again
reminding
the
court
that
ms.
richardson
had
stated
the
defendant
had
been
in
her
apartment
on
several
occasions.
there
was
also
some
evidence
from
a
serologist
as
to
the
group
a
secretions
on
some
rags
that
were
found
and
that
the
victim
was
a
group
a
secretor
apparently
trying
to
corroborate
the
victim's
story.
later
on
the
prosecutor
made
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
wife
did
not
testify,
in
violation
of
kentucky
statute
on
spousal
immunity,
to
the
effect
that
had
the
victim's
wife
been
a
group
a
secretor
she
would
have
been
brought
forward,
which
i
think
is
still
yet
another
consideration
of
the
court,
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
error
was
harmless.
finally,
david
adams
testified,
who
is
her
immediate
supervisor,
that
she
came
back
upset
from
lunch.
he
also
testified
that
she
was
four
and
a
half
hours
late,
that
her
job
performance
had
been
fluctuating
in
the
preceding
weeks.
the
defendant
then
presented
evidence
simply
as
to
the
rape
charge.
mr.
marion
bates
testified
that
he
was
actually
in
the
basement
of
the
defendant's
residence
where
the
rape
allegedly
occurred,
and
that
he
heard
no
noises
up
there
but
a
record
player
going
on.
he
specifically
recalls
leaving
that
apartment
sometime
between
20
minutes
to
1:00
and
1:00
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
to
work
on
his
car
in
the
driveway,
which
was
next-door
to
the
defendant's
residence.
he
also
specifically
recalled
seeing
the
defendant
leave
at
ten
minutes...
at
2:00
o'clock
or
shortly
before
2:00
o'clock.
the
defendant
testified
that
she
was
unlawfully
imprisoned
by
the
defendant
in
his
apartment
from
approximately
a
short
time
after
12:30
until
almost
4:30.
so
there
was
defense
evidence
calling
into
question
the
victim's
account
of
the
case.
then
a
mr.
lambert
also
testified
that
he
often
would
show
mr.
bates
the
basement
in
the
apartment
where
the
defendant
lived
and
where
the
crime
allegedly
occurred,
didn't
recall
the
specific
date,
but
did
corroborate
mr.
bates'
testimony
to
the
extent
that
he
said
he
often
shows
mr.
bates
that
property
because
it
was
under
renovation.
it
was
at
this
point,
after
all
the
evidence,
that
the
defendant
requested
the
admonition
that
was
denied--
in
the
prosecutor's
closing
argument,
he
made
two
references
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
contradict
the
victim's
story.
i
think
that
at
least
the
federal
circuit
courts
have
held
that
when
the
defendant
is
the
only
person
that
can
contradict
testimony,
that
a
reference
to
the
failure
to
contradict
is
an
indirect
reference
on
the
failure
to
testify,
which
again
is
two
occurrences
of
griffin
error.
there
was
no
request
for
an
admonition
in
that
particular--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
where
the
defendant's
evidence
was
limited
to
the
rape
charge
and
there
wasn't
any
evidence
on
the
other
charges,
that
that
had
to
be
considered
by
the
jury
as
a
reference
to
the
defendant,
even
though--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--as
to
those
charges?
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
no,
sir.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
if
such
witnesses
were
available,
but
then,
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
available
or
not
or
why
he
did
not.
i
think
that--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--right,
and
that's
exactly
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
would
assume
that
the
reason
he
didn't
bring
any
evidence
forward
and
the
reason
he
didn't
testify
was
because
he
guilty.
the
court
indicated
in
lakeside
v.
oregon
that
that
is
the
natural
inference.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
would
agree
with
the
court's
statement
in
lakeside
that
the
court
has
yet
not
come
to
a
conclusion
that
juries
are
going
to
disregard
admonitions
or
instructions
of
the
court.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
has
to
assume
that
if
they
were
instructed
to
disregard
this,
then
they
would.
that
is
the
basis
and
the
rationale
of
the
court's
holding
in
carter
v.
kentucky.
if
that's
not
held
true,
then
carter
doesn't
make
sense.
now--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--i
think
carter
simply
stands
for
the
proposition
that
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
brennan
stated
in
their
concurring
opinion
that
whether...
i
take
that
back...
in
lakeside,
that
whether
or
not
the
jury
is
going
to
be
given
any
guidance
on
the
failure
to
testify
is
going
to
be
up
to
counsel
and
the
defendant,
and
in
this
particular
case,
it's
obvious
that
counsel
and
the
defendant
requested
some
jury
guidance
and
were
denied
it.
i
would
like
to
talk
briefly
about
what
i
think
are
the
constitutional
underpinnings
of
this
case.
obviously
the
court's
familiar
with
wilson
that
applied
a
federal
statute
precluding
comment
on
a
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
wilson
was
constitutionalized
in
griffin.
bruno,
which
was
a
precursor
to
carter,
mandated
that
upon
request,
a
jury
be
instructed
as
to
a
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
also
in
bruno,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
going
to
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
to
that
type
of
error
because
it
didn't
have
to
do
with
the
mere
etiquette
of
trial
rules.
in
malloy
v.
hogan,
this
court
stated
that
a
defendant
should
suffer
no
penalty
as
a
result
of
his
exercise
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
in
later
cases,
particularly
lakeside
and
carter,
the
court
found
that
when
a
defendant
either
requests
instruction
on
the
fifth
amendment,
or
alternatively,
when
the
court
gives
it
over
the
defendant's
objection,
that
all
that
does
is
prevent
undue
speculation,
i
believe
the
court's
language
was
to
the
effect
of
allowing
a
jury
to
roam
at
large
guided
only
by
its
untutored
instincts
with
regard
to
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
the
court
also
cited
in
footnotes
that
many
commentators
and
many
sociologists
believe
that
most
persons
are
going
to
equate
the
failure
to
testify
with
guilt.
again,
in
this
case,
there
was
an
apparent
reason
for
not
testifying,
not
having
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence,
that
being
the
defendant's
threatened
impeachment
with
a
felony
conviction
which
was
at
issue
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
as
a
persistent
felony
offender--
if
i
can
move
on
to
the
procedural
bar
that
was
applied
by
the
kentucky
supreme
court,
they
basically
stated
that
the
defendant
asked
for
the
wrong
relief,
consequently,
he
is
barred
from
the
correct
relief.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
i
don't
think
that
the
defendant
asked
for
relief
that
was
constitutionally
improper,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
substantial
interest
in
applying
a
procedural
bar
to
a
fifth
amendment
violation.
this
court
took
into
consideration
a
fifth
amendment
violation
in
brooks
v.
tennessee
and
conceded
that
the
state
of
tennessee
had
a
substantial
interest
in
making
a
defendant
testify
first
in
that
it
precluded
the
defendant
from
coloring
his
testimony
due
to
other
defense
witnesses
testifying
first,
the
defendant
changing
his
testimony.
this
court
conceded
that
that
was
as
substantial
interest
and
stated
that
was
not
compelling
enough
to
overcome
his
fifth
amendment
violation
by
infringing
upon
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
decide
when
he
will
testify
or
if
he
will
testify.
it
also
infringed
on
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
kentucky
has
advanced
no
substantial
interest
that
would
overcome
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
right
to
jury
guidance
on
this
particular
issue.
i
think
henry
v.
mississippi
also
speaks
as
to
the
state's
interest
in
applying
a
procedural
bar.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
my
basic
argument
is
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
admonition,
at
the
very
least.
if
i
have
a
few
minutes,
i
would
like
to
address
the
state's
assertion
of
harmlessness.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
don't
think
that
this
type
of
error
can
ever
be
harmless,
based
upon
the
court's
pronouncement
in
bruno,
based
upon
the
court's
pronouncement
in
malloy,
that
no
watered-down
version
of
the
privilege
applies
to
the
states.
the
significance
of
lakeside
as
to
harmlessness
is
the
following:
the
court
in
lakeside
stated
that
the
petitioner
lakeside's
assertion
that
the
trial
court
intruded
on
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
by
giving
an
instruction
rested
on
two
very
doubtful
instructions,
one,
that
the
jury
didn't
notice
the
defendant
didn't
testify,
and
two,
that
the
jury
would
disregard
any
admonition
or
instruction.
in
this
case
we
are
left
with
the
proposition
that
this
court
certainly
believes
that
the
jury
noticed
that
the
defendant
didn't
testify,
that
they
were
not
given
the
benefit
of
any
jury
guidance.
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
this
is
not
like
a
griffin
error,
which
i
think
the
court
believes
may
be
harmless.
as
i
stated
earlier
in
my
argument,
when
a
griffin
error
occurs,
even
though
in
griffin
it
was
a
combination
of
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor,
currently
griffin
errors
are
most
often
committed
by
a
prosecutor.
the
relief
is
an
admonition
by
the
trial
court.
there
is
no
relief
for
this
type
of
error
in
violation
of
carter.
again,
it
also
invades
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
which
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
hold
harmless.
there
are
numerous
reasons
why
if
the
court
finds
that
it
can
be
susceptible
to
harmless
error
analysis,
it
should
not
be
harmless
in
this
case.
one,
the
court's
refusal
to
sever
the
burglary
charge
and
the
esp
charge,
of
which
there
was
very
little
or
scant
evidence,
the
limitation
of
voir
dire,
the
two
doyle
errors
by
detective
sparks
and
detective
owen,
the
griffin
errors
in
closing
argument
by
the
prosecutor,
the
violation
of
the
spousal
immunity
privilege
by
the
prosecutor
in
closing
argument,
the
fact
that
petitioner's
failure
to
testify
was
not
related
to
guilt
or
innocense,
the
fact
that
petitioner's
defense
as
to
the
rape
charge
tended
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
presence
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
and
finally,
that
if
this
court's
statement
in
lakeside
and
later
in
carter
is
true
that
an
inference
that
the
jury
might
draw
from
failure
to
testify
as
to
the
defendant's
guilt
is
inevitable,
then
certainly
it
occurred
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
convicted
this
defendant
of
a
burglary
charge
where
there
was
certainly
no
evidence
of
an
entry
other
than
one
fingerprint
in
an
apartment
where
he
had
been
before.
if
this
case
had
been
tried
alone,
i
think
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
as
a
matter
of
law
on
that
kind
of
evidence.
and
finally--
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
--there
was
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
as
to
all
counts.
mr.
c.
thomas
hectus
no,
sir,
it
wasn't
articulated
such
that
it
broke
the...
that
defense
counsel
broke
down
the
evidence
as
to
each
charge,
but
he
did
move
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
after
the
commonwealth's
evidence
and
after
the
state's
evidence.
thank
you.
