unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
you
say
that
your
clients
prevailed
throughout
the
litigation
on
their
due
process
claim.
i
didn't
read
judge
campbell's
opinion
is
necessarily
agreeing
with
that.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference
between
prevailing
through
the
course
of
the
litigation
and
ultimately
prevailing?
i
take
it
from
your
argument
you
see
those
as
two
different
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
held
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
plaintiff
prevailed
without
a
doubt.
but
i
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
intimating
that
you
prevailed
on
the
eahca.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you're
arguing
about
a
question
of
fact,
really,
where
the
court
of
appeals
is
against
you,
and
we
ordinarily
don't
review
questions
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
don't
suppose
anyone
disputes
that,
but
i
think
what
the
first
circuit
says
is
you
prevailed
on
the
eahca
count;
that's
an
all-embracing
statutory
claim
that
really
covers
everything
you
could
have
gotten
on
your
constitutional
counts,
and
since
that
doesn't
provide
for
attorney's
fees
you
can't
get
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
did
not
the
district
court,
after
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court,
say
that
you
had
prevailed
as
a
result
of
the
state
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
did?
unknown
speaker
that
you'd
obtained
all
the
relief
you
sought--
unknown
speaker
--as
a
result
of
the
state
decision.
unknown
speaker
and
was
it
not
after
that
decision
was
made
by
the
district
court
that
you
filed
your
second
amendment
and
alleged
a
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
when
did
you
first
file
that?
unknown
speaker
that
was
after--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
was
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is,
hadn't
you
obtained
all
the
relief
you
sought
before
you
filed
your
amended
complaint?
unknown
speaker
but
was
there
a
substantial
issue
left
after
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
on
the
same
point,
i
also
fail
to
understand
what
happened
and
why
there
was
a
year's
worth
of
litigation
after
the
state
supreme
court
issued
its
ruling,
which
furnished
the
only
basis
for
the
ultimate
ruling
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
on
what,
the
fee?
unknown
speaker
you
made
two
different
types
of
due
process
claims
during
the
course
of
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
one
was
against
a
local
school
committee,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
original--
unknown
speaker
--injunction,
i
guess,
the
preliminary
injunction.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
was
really
a
complaint
concerning
the
termination
of
funding
pending
resolution
of
the
dispute
against
the
school
committee.
unknown
speaker
the
funding
for
the
child's
education.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
then
the
second
due
process
claim
was
against
the
respondents
here
and
had
to
do
with
their
serving
as
hearing
officers
in
your
dispute
with
the
school
board.
unknown
speaker
and
no
relief
was
granted
under
that
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
didn't
the
terms
of
the
preliminary
injunction
run
only
against
the
school
committee?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
terms
of
the
injunction
did
not
run
against
these
respondents,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
or
not,
in
terms
of
the
words
of
the
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
well,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
ran
initially
only
against
the
school.
i
gathered
from
your
answer
that
perhaps
later
it
was
amended
to
run--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
what
you
meant?
unknown
speaker
could
you
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you're
answering
my
question.
i
asked
you,
when
you
answered
initially
to
justice
o'connor,
i
got
the
implication
that
at
some
later
point
the
injunction
was
amended--
unknown
speaker
--to
run
against
the
state
defendants
as
well.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
true
or
not?
is
that
correct
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
it
never
did
run
in
terms
against
the
state
defendants?
unknown
speaker
were
they
named
in
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
could
i
bring
you
back
to
something
you
started
off
with,
and
that
was
your
reference
to
maher
against
gagne.
unknown
speaker
the
first
circuit
mentioned
it
once
in
its
opinion,
as
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
just
once,
and
sort
of
by
a
passing
way.
do
you
think
they
overlooked
it
or
didn't
want
to
face
up
to
maher
against
gagne
or
what?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opponent
that
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
thought
that
was
error
and
vacated
the
opinion
and
sent
it
back,
would
it
be
open
in
remand
for
the
application
of
the
hensley
principles
announced
last
term?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
appear
to
have
been.
unknown
speaker
mr.
larson,
i'm
afraid
we've
not
given
you
much
time
to
argue
the
case,
but
the
point
that
i
asked
you
about
before
is
central
to
my
own
understanding
of
the
case.
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
after
your
view
had
prevailed
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
you
of
course
had
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
because
the
questions
had
been
certified
to
the
state
court--
unknown
speaker
--did
you
ask
the
district
court
on
your
return
to
it
to
give
you
any
relief
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
not
given
you?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
a
motion--
unknown
speaker
--a
motion
filed,
was
this
in
your
complaint
that
had
already
been
filed
some
time
before,
or
did
you...
what
did
you
request
specifically
when
you
went
back?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court,
though,
still
said
that
you
had
won
everything
you
ever
sought?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
file
your
1983
claim
until
after,
according
to
the
district
court,
you
had
won
everything
the
plaintiff
sought?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you've
been
paid
for
that
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
was
it
necessary,
then,
for
you
to
amend
your
complaint,
the
second
amended
complaint?
unknown
speaker
and
when
did
you
add
the
section
1988
claim?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
mr.
larson,
the
court
didn't
discuss,
and
i
don't
believe
the
briefs
do,
cases
such
as
brown
against
the
gsa
and
pryzer
versus
rodriquez,
where
this
court
has
said
that
a
detailed
comprehensive
statute
precludes
remedies
under
the
broader
1983
type
claim.
and
i
wonder
if
that's
applicable
here
with
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
can't
you
define
legislative
intent
by
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
enacted
a
very
specific,
detailed
plan
for
these
education
for
the
handicapped
provisions,
and
refer
to
that
instead
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
travel
of
the
case.
is
this
a
rhode
island
expression?
unknown
speaker
we've
come
across
it
in
one
other
case.
unknown
speaker
you
never
find
it
in
california,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
the
beginning
again?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
this
thing
in
the
right
sequence.
the
very
beginning
of
the
litigation,
as
i
understand
it,
the
child
was
about
to
be...
the
funds
were
about
to
be
withdrawn
and
the
child
was
about
to
be
transferred
to
a
different
facility.
unknown
speaker
but
the
allegation
is--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
was
was
that
there
was
a
risk
the
child
would
be
transferred,
wasn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
funds
were
going
to
be
withdrawn?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand.
but
at
that
point
the
district
judge
entered
an
injunction
maintaining
the
status
quo.
unknown
speaker
and
that
action
rested
entirely
on
federal
law,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
the
theory
of
the
complaint
was
that
the
failure
to
follow
the
correct
procedures
violated
due
process
and
therefore
there
was
a
1983
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
really
the
only
claim
in
the
original
complaint.
unknown
speaker
was
the
only
claim
in
the
original
complaint.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
maintained
the
status
quo.
then
all
these
other
things
developed
after
that.
unknown
speaker
if
at
least
there's
a
colorable
argument
that
it
was
based
on
1983,
why
doesn't
that
support
a
fee
award?
unknown
speaker
mr.
avila,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
not
address
the
maher
versus
gagne
type
approach
and
talk
about
the
substantiality
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
the
meritorious
nature
of
the
statutory
claim
under
504?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
was
just
why
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
come
to
grips
with
the
test--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
approach
in
maher
versus
gagne
in
all
respects?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there's
no
repeal
of
1983
by
implication,
in
effect,
for
these
purposes
and
the
two
avenues
of
relief
are
open,
then
you
have
to
determine
the
substantiality
of
the
1983
claim,
i
guess,
if
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
under
a
brown
versus
gsa
type
of
approach?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
1983
action,
or
it
didn't
hold
that
this
act
precluded
any
parallel
remedies
anywhere
else.
they
just
said
it
precluded
attorney's
fees.
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
would
that
argument
suggest
that
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
certify
the
question
it
did
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
in
retrospect,
it
seems
you
were
quite
wrong,
doesn't
it,
under
pennhurst?
unknown
speaker
weren't
you
obliged
to
allege
them
in
the
original
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
weren't
you
obliged
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
should
hold
one
of
them
back?
unknown
speaker
for
sandbagging
purposes?
unknown
speaker
for
fee
purposes?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
larson,
how
can
you
say
there
is
no
pennhurst
issue?
how
can
you
say
that?
he
based
the
decision
on
state
law
when
he
could
have
done
it
on
federal
grounds,
and
there
was
a
state
defendant
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
directly...
isn't
that
exactly
what
pennhurst
prohibits?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
it
was
done
on
defendants'
application,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it's
consistent
with
pennhurst,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
thought
earlier
in
the
argument
it
was
developed
that
all
of
the
relief
was
based
entirely
on
state
law,
as
you
eventually
got
through.
but
that
isn't
right?
unknown
speaker
against
state
defendants,
based
on
the
state
law,
in
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
relief
really
rested
on
a
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
so
they
interpreted,
reinterpreted
the
whole
run
of
events
and
said
that
it
was
under
the
education
for
the
handicapped
act.
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
in
a
word
why
you
think
you're
entitled
to
fees
for
the
state
administrative
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
mandatory
exhaustion
proceeding
is
under
a
statute
that
doesn't
provide
for
fees.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
