mr.
e.
richard
larson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
petitioners'
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1988
in
this
action
to
enforce
constitutional
rights
through
section
1983.
this
case
also
involves
fee
entitlement
under
section
505(b)
of
the
rehabilitation
act
in
this
action
brought
to
enforce
and
to
charge
a
violation
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
as
in
vlum
v.
stenson,
decided
unanimously
by
this
court
last
week,
resolution
in
this
case
begins
and
ends
with
the
legislative
history
accompanying
these
fee
provision,
a
legislative
history
in
which
congress
stated
that
plaintiffs
need
not
prevail
on
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
or
on
another
overlapping
fee
claim
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
fees.
this
case
we
submit
is
further
controlled
by
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
maher
v.
gagne,
a
decision
in
which
this
court
not
only
conclusively
applied
the
foregoing
legislative
history,
but
indeed
it
is
the
same
legislative
history
that
is
applicable
here.
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
a
plaintiff
who
never
obtained
a
ruling
on
her
substantial
constitutional
claim
nonetheless
was
entitled
to
fees
under
section
1988.
in
this
case,
petitioner
tommy
smith
is
a
physically
and
emotionally
handicapped
child
who
walks
with
the
aid
of
leg
braces
and
crutches
due
to
cerebral
palsy.
tommy
was
eight
years
old
when
this
litigation
was
commenced
in
1976.
tommy
at
that
time
was
enrolled
in
a
special
education
day
program
approved
by
the
respondents
and
paid
for
by
the
school
committee
as
part
of
their
education
program.
this
litigation
was
commenced
when
the
local
school
committee,
with
the
subsequent
approval
and
support
of
the
respondents,
proposed
to
exclude
tommy
from
receiving
an
education
solely
because
of
the
nature
of
his
handicap.
respondents'
consistent
litigation
position
throughout
this
litigation
has
been
that
the
school
committees,
including
the
local
school
committee
here,
and
the
respondents
had
no
responsibility
for
educating
tommy
or
similarly
situated
persons
who
had
an
emotional
handicap.
petitioners'
complaint
alleged
three
substantial
federal
claims.
initially,
they
were
constitutional
claims.
indeed,
the
opening
complaint
alleged
only
constitutional
claims.
this
was
a
due
process
claim...
the
petitioner
was
being
excluded,
being
denied
an
education,
with
no
hearing
whatsoever...
and
also
a
straight
equal,
protection
claim...
that
petitioner
was
being
denied
an
education,
excluded
from
an
education,
in
violation
of
equal
protection.
petitioners
also
alleged
a
federal
claim
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
the
language
of
which
specifically
precludes
the
exclusion
of
a
person
from
receiving
federal
benefits
in
a
federal
program,
a
program
supported
by
federal
moneys,
solely
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
a
third
federal
claim
was
also
alleged
in
this
case,
the
'75
handicapped
act.
after
the
act
became
effective
and
subsequent
to
plaintiff's
success
on
their
constitutional
claims,
plaintiffs
added
the
claim
that
the
respondents
had
violated
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act
of
1975.
now,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
about
the
appropriateness
of
the
education
that
was
designed
for
tommy.
it's
simply
a
question
of
exclusion
versus
non-exclusion.
there
also
is
no
question
in
this
case
petitioners
in
fact
prevailed.
they
prevailed
initially
and
throughout
the
litigation
on
their
due
process
claim,
and
they
ultimately
prevailed,
primarily
as
a
result
of
a
certified
decision
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
characterization
of
judge
campbell's
opinion...
or
in
the
opinion,
is
that
we
ultimately
prevailed
as
a
matter
of
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act.
judge
campbell
does
not
disagree
whatsoever
that
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation
it
was
the
preliminary
injunction
entered
on
the
due
process
claim
pursuant
to
which
plaintiffs
through
the
course
of
the
litigation
prevailed.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
was
saying
that
there
is
no
question
on
this
record
whatsoever,
justice
rehnquist,
about
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
prevailed.
under
hensley--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--oh,
no.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
plaintiff
as
having
prevailed.
indeed,
in
the
first
decision
to
the
first
circuit--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--but
that
is
belied
by
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
justice
rehnquist,
it
doesn't
matter
with
regard
to
the
statutory
threshold
that
plaintiffs
must
meet
through
hensley
v.
eckerhart
how
plaintiffs
happened
to
prevail
here.
the
matter
of
fact
as
found
by
the
district
court
is
that
plaintiffs
did
prevail.
indeed,
our
opponents
at
the
fee
hearing
admitted
that
we
had
obtained
the
objective
sought
in
the
lawsuit
and
that
we
accordingly
were
the
prevailing
party--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--the
first
circuit's
decision
on
the
fee
issue
is
different
from
the
first
circuit's
decision
on
defendant's
appeal
on
their
motion
to
dismiss.
on
the
first
decision,
the
first
circuit
states
that
plaintiffs
have
obtained
the
objective
of
their
lawsuit
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
that's
on
the
merits.
subsequently
in
the
collateral
fee
proceeding,
the
first
circuit
basically
stated
that
the
plaintiffs
have
prevailed
both
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
as
a
matter
of
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act,
ultimately
prevailed.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
district
court--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--in
its
final
order
on
the
merits
held
that
we
had
obtained
the
objective
of
our
lawsuit.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
second
amended
complaint
was
filed
after
the
summer
of
1980,
the
june
1980
decision
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
was
one
year
before
the
final
order
on
the
merits.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct,
and
that
nonetheless
related
back
to...
i
mean,
it
was
a
motion
to
file
a
second
amended
complaint,
which
was
granted
and
which
relates
back.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
not
necessarily.
on
certification,
the
decision
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
is
essentially
an
advisory
opinion.
there
was
a
period
in
which
we
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
indeed
was
going
to
be
compliance.
now,
there
was
never
any
injunction
entered
against
the
respondents
directing
compliance.
there
was
a
january
1981
injunction
issued
against
the...
consent
injunction
issued
against
the
school
committee
requiring
their
compliance.
it
was
indeed
ascertained
that
compliance
would
be
obtained.
plus
there
was
the
outstanding
matter
of
attorney's
fees.
the
defendants
tried
to
get
out
of
this
lawsuit
because
they
saw
attorney's
fees
coming.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
matter
of
compliance,
yes,
plus
there
was
also
the
matter
that
on
this
record
in
this
case
the
state
hearing
officer
decision
was
still
on
the
record
in
this
case,
and
that
plaintiffs
had
a
right
to
have
that
decision
basically
stricken
or
recognized
as
not
controlling,
and
that
is
indeed
something
that
happened
in
the
final
order.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it's
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
a
year
in
time
passed.
there
was
not
a
year
of
litigation.
immediately
after
the
state
supreme
court
opinion,
the
motion
for
amended
complaint
was
filed.
that
was
granted
shortly
thereafter,
basically
in
july.
the
amended
complaint
was
then
actually
filed
in
the
fall,
and
then
we're
into
the
winter,
when
motions
began
to
be
filed
to
complete
the
matter
of
relief
in
this
case.
during
that
period
of
time,
the
petitioners
and
the
school
committee
worked
out
a
consent
decree,
basically,
which
included
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
the
school
committee.
the
state,
however,
was
not
so
sure
that
it
was
going
to
go
along,
and
it
looked
like
further
litigation
might
be
necessary
against
the
respondents
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
basically
the
petitioners
wanted
a
ruling
on
federal
law.
they
of
course
dig
not
obtain
it
because
the
district
court
judge
in
his
final
order
said
that,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
federal
law
issues
because
we...
i
recognize,
the
district
court
recognizes,
the
plaintiff
has
obtained
the
objective
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
but
that
was
also
against
the--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--yes,
an
injunction
which
was
continued
also
against
the
state
after
the
state
was
brought
in.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
no.
the
termination
of
tommy's
education.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
was
a
gibson
v.
berryhill
type
claim,
challenging
the
bias
in
the
process
itself,
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
but
the
first
claim,
the
due
process
claim,
equally
runs
against
the
respondents
as
well
because
of
the
modified
preliminary
injunction
that
was
subsequently
entered
after
the
respondents
were
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
initially,
yes.
but
of
course,
the
state
was
involved
in
the
funding
of
this
process.
the
state
has
the
responsibility
for
enforcing
state
law.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
as
state
actors,
acting
in
cooperation
with
the
local
defendants--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--in
the
words
of
the
preliminary
injunction,
it's
only
against
the
school
board.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
was
the--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--yes.
the
original
preliminary
injunction
was
directed
solely
against
the
school
committee,
because
indeed
the
respondents
had
not
yet
been
sued,
and
the
terms
of
the
preliminary
injunction
were
to
maintain
tommy
in
his
educational
program
during
the
pendency
of
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
procedures.
thereafter,
it
was
extended
because
the
administrative
procedures
and--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
state
defendants--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
it
did
not
name
the
state
in
the
injunction.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
that
they
were
co-actors
responsible
in
this
litigation--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--no.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
certainly
think--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--well,
i
certainly
do
believe
they
overlooked
it.
there
was
no
analysis
of
it
whatsoever.
plus,
of
course,
in
maher
this
court
set
out
the
legislative
history,
the
relevant
legislative
history
of
section
1988,
and
the
first
circuit
never
mentioned
that
legislative
history
whatsoever.
i
think
they
may
have
been
unaware
of
the
legislative
history
or
unwilling
to
look
at
it.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
hensley
principles,
even
pre-hensley,
were
applied
by
the
district
court.
for
example,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--well,
justice
o'connor,
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
substantive
due
process
claim
with
regard
to
the
gibson
v.
berryhill
issue
was
not
one
on
which
claims
prevailed.
the
district
court
deducted
the
fees
or
the
time
spent
on
that
issue
from
the
fee
award
that
was
granted.
there
is
a
type
of
hensley
issue
still
pending
in
the
first
circuit.
i
wouldn't
really
consider
it
a
hensley
issue,
but
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
time
that
was
spent
in
the
administrative
proceeding
and
the
state
court
proceeding
is
correctly
time
which
should
be
compensated
in
this
litigation.
that
was
not
addressed
by
the
first
circuit
in
this
appeal
because
of
the
way
the
first
circuit
disposed
of
the
fee
entitlement
issue.
that
issue,
of
course,
would
be
open
on
remand.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there
was
a
motion
filed
with
regard
to
the
due
process
claim
involving
the
lack--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--of
impartiality--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--we
requested
that
the
hearing
process
itself
be
declared
violative
of
due
process
because
of
interested
persons
acting
as
hearing
officers.
we
sought
further
relief
on
that
and
we
were
denied
that.
that
is
in
the
complaint
and
it
was
part
of
a
separate
motion
subsequent
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court's
decision.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there
is
no
question
that
the
major
issue
in
this
case
was
tommy's
education.
i
think
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
finding
of
fact
that
plaintiffs
had
obtained
the
result
sought,
and
i
think
the
first
circuit
in
its
appeal
on
the
merits
was
correct
in
also
making
that
same
finding
of
fact.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
the
1983
claim
was
the
first
claim
in
the
case.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no.
i
mean,
the
1983
equal
protection
claim,
which
the
trial
court
found
to
be
substantial,
is
a
claim
that
is
encompassed
within
the
initial
complaint
that
was
filed,
yes,
against
the
school
committee.
but
thereafter
the
respondents
came
in
and
stood
in
the
shoes
of
the
school
committee.
we
know
the
responsibility
of
the
state
for
education
and
it
came
in
and
the
litigation
continued
thereafter.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
first
amended
complaint
added
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act
claim,
because
that
had
then
become
an
effective
federal
law.
and
the
third
amended
complaint
added
the
504
claim.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
section
1988
claim
was
in
the
first
amended
complaint
and
also
in
the
second
amended
complaint.
section
1988
with
regard
to
fees,
as
a
matter
of
fees
law,
need
not
necessarily
be
pled.
there
was
a
boilerplate
request
for
such
further
relief
in
the
first
complaint,
and
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
held
as
sufficient
to
encompass
a
request
for
fees.
as
i
have
stated,
i
believe
that
because
of
the
legislative
history
and
because
of
the
unanimous
decision
by
this
court
in
maher
v.
gagne,
this
case
is
conclusively...
or
it
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
petitioners
here.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
believe
that
those
cases
are
inapposite.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
first
circuit
here
applied
middlesex
county.
middlesex
county,
with
its
comprehensiveness
test,
applies
only
to
the
"and
laws"
issue.
there
is
no
"and
laws"
issue
here.
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children
act
is
not
being
proposed
to
be
asserted
through
the
1983.
it
simply
is
not
relevant.
nonetheless,
a
little
bit
more
relevant,
but
still
inapposite,
are
the
preemption
doctrine
and
the
implication
by...
repeal
by
implication
doctrine.
all
of
those
doctrines,
both
the
preemption
doctrine
and
the
repeal
by
implication
doctrine,
as
well
as
the
middlesex
county
comprehensiveness
test,
bottom
out
on
the
legislative
intent.
each
of
those
tests
is
based
upon
the
legislative
intent.
now,
first
of
all
with
regard
to
fees--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--no.
neither
preemption
nor
repeal
by
implication
allows
this
court
to
use
a
test
without
going
to
the
legislative
history.
the
test
is
a
substitute
for
the
legislative
history.
for
example,
in
brown
v.
gsa
the
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history
and
what
had
congress
done
in
1972.
it
had
said
there
is
no
remedy
for
employment
discrimination
in
the
federal
sector
because
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
it
cited
blaze
v.
moon
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it
cited
a
number
of
other
sovereign
immunity
cases.
congress
was
aware
from
its
perception
that
it
was
operating
on
a
blank
sheet,
and
it
thereby
enacted
comprehensive
legislation.
the
legislative
history
here
is
totally
different
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
fees,
the
fee
statutes
at
issue
here
were
enacted,
section
1988
was
enacted,
in
1976,
a
year
after
the
'75
act.
section
505
was
enacted
three
years
later,
in
1978.
i
mean,
there
is
no
doctrine
of
repeal
by
implication
or
preemption
which
allows
a
congress
sitting
in
1975
to
preempt
acts
that
the
congress
takes
in
the
future.
with
regard
to
the
substantive
rights,
it
is
even
less
likely
that
congress
could
have
preempted,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
spending
statute
which
is
optional
with
the
states.
it's
almost
as
if,
to
follow
through
on
this
preemption
or
repeal
by
implication
argument,
if
it's
worth
anything,
that
congress
delegated
to
the
states
whether
or
not
the
states
wanted
to
repeal
the
applicability
of
504.
so
if
the
state
opts
out
of
this,
they're
covered
by
504.
we
know
that
new
mexico
is
not
covered
by
the
1975
handicapped
act.
yet
504
and
1983
fully
apply
there.
i
mean,
it
would
be
absolutely
unheard
of
for
congress
to
delegate
to
the
states
the
repeal
of
federal
statutes,
much
less
the
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights.
and
finally,
of
course,
what
is
ultimately
controlling
is
the
legislative
history
itself.
the
legislative
history...
the
senate
report
alone
has
22
paragraphs
spanning
16
pages
discussing
the
existence
of
preexisting
and
concurrent
remedies
in
this
situation.
there
is
absolutely
full
awareness
of
these
preexisting
remedies,
and
the
case
couldn't
be
farther
away
from
brown
v.
gsa.
this
is
rally
a
jones
v.
mayer
type
of
case
or
a
johnson
v.
rea
type
of
case.
congress
was
aware
and
did
not
at
all
preempt
or
repeal
by
implication
those
remedies.
there
has
to
be
a
clear
statement.
it
is
not
here
whatsoever.
we
believe,
on
the
basis
of
maher
v.
gagne,
that
this
case
should
be
conclusively
resolved
in
petitioners'
favor.
in
maher
there
was
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
which
was
not
addressed.
there
was
also
a
substantial
federal
statutory
claim
which
did
not
necessarily
have
a
fee
authorization
attached
to
it.
the
plaintiffs
were
determined
to
have
passed
that
statutory
threshold
of
having
prevailed
without
ever
receiving
an
adjudication
on
their
constitutional
claim,
and
this
court
unanimously
held
that
plaintiff,
because
of
the
fact
that
she
had
raised
a
substantial
constitutional
claim,
was
entitled
to
fees
under
section
1988.
and
the
same
result
flows
here,
not
only
under
section
1988
but
also
under
section
505.
in
conclusion,
we
believe
that
there
is
little
question
on
this
record
and
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
first
circuit
erred
here
and
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
fees.
now,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
this
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
amount
of
fees,
which
is
still
an
issue
or
will
be
an
issue
on
remand
in
the
first
circuit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
unless
there
are
any
questions.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
adversary
seemed
to
imply
that
the
claims
in
this
case,
the
504
claims
and
the
constitutional
claims,
were
kind
of
back
door
claims
to
get
attorney's
fees.
i
respectfully
disagree.
this
is
an
exclusion
case.
there
could
be
no
stronger
case
for
an
equal
protection
claim
on
this
record.
the
original
complaint
sought
relief
under
the
constitution
in
general,
and
it
did
specify
due
process.
the
subsequent
complaints
can
all
be
read
as
having,
no
question
about
it,
an
equal
protection
claim
in
it.
the
504
claim
is
as
substantial
as
a
504
claim
can
be.
this
is,
again,
an
exclusion
case.
the
language
of
504
bars
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
now,
as
attorneys
representing
the
plaintiffs
we
had
the
responsibility
to
allege
not
only
substantial
claims,
but
claims
which
we
believe
we
can
win
on.
in
this
case
we
had
three
sets
of--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--the
504
claim
could
have
been
alleged
in
the
original
complaint.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
we
were
not
obliged
to
do
it.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there
was
no
intentional
holding
back,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
this
was
no
sandbagging,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
your
honor.
the
fees
were
in
this
case
from
the
beginning
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
stated
on
the
face
of
the
initial
complaint.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
trial
court
here
made
as
an
ultimate
finding
of
fact
the
finding
that
the
equal
protection
claim
was
substantial,
and
that
was
deferred
to...
a
similar
finding
was
deferred
to
in
the
majority
opinion
by
this
court
in
maher
v.
gagne
in
footnote
10,
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
powell
there
is
a
statement
saying
that,
we
have
no
occasion
to,
because
of
the
settlement,
to
evaluate
further
the
constitutional
cause
of
action.
there
is
no
question
that
plaintiffs
were
prevailing
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
fact
with
regard
to
the
question
that
justice
powell
raised
with
me
earlier
about
the
chronology.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
answered
it
quite
clearly
enough.
the
state
defendants
were
added
in
this
case
after
the
administrative
procedures
had
been
exhausted,
prior
to
the
certification
order.
and,
as
mr.
avila
pointed
out,
it
was
the
respondents
who
came
in
and
sought
the
certification.
plaintiffs
had
three
winning
federal
claims
and
we
were
more
than
happy
to
win
on
any
one
of
those
claims.
the
trial
court,
in
a
model
of
deference
to
comity
and
to
federalism,
did
grant
the
certification
order.
no
pennhurst
issue
was
involved
in
this
case
whatsoever.
instead,
what
the
court
did
was
it
avoided
not
only
the
federal
statutory
issues,
but
it
also
avoided
the
constitutional
issue.
this
court
only
yesterday
in
escambia
county
cited
with
approval
ashwander
once
again
in
order
to
avoid
deciding
unnecessarily
constitutional--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--there
is
no--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--no
federal
court
interpretation
whatsoever
of
the
state
law.
it's
a
certification
that
happened
on
defendants'
application.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
pennhurst
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes,
as
i
understand
pennhurst,
bars
a
federal
court
order
based
upon
state
law,
an
injunctive
order
requiring
state
officials
to
comply
with
state
law.
there
was
no
such
order
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
jurisdiction
was
alleged
solely
on
our
1983,
504,
and
'75
education
act.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
plaintiffs
obtained
the
objectives
sought
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
as
a
result
of
a
state
court
ruling--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--in
their
second
opinion,
yes,
they
did.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
state
of
rhode
island
decision,
because
it
starts
out
with
several
paragraphs
discussing
the
federal
law--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--it
gets
into
an
interpretation
of
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
gaslight
versus
carey
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
to
be
a
mandatory
exhaustion
proceeding
or
whether
fees
are
also
available--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
that's
something
that
the
first
circuit
would
have
to
deal
with
on
remand.
it
was
raised
before
the
first
circuit
and
not
reached
by
the
first
circuit.
