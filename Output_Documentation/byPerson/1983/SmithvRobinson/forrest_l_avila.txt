mr.
forrest
l.
avila
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
that
the
court
has
indicated
some
interest
in,
in
essence,
the
travel
of
this
case,
so
i
want
to
explain
a
little
bit
of
the
history
of
this
so
we
see
how
this
case
came
into
focus.
i
want
to
point
out
here
that
i
represent
the
commissioner
of
education
and
not
the
local
school
committee
in
this
action.
what
happened--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--that's
i
think
common
in
the
first
circuit,
too.
i
think
i
see
it
all
the
time.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
i
was
not
aware
that
it
was
an
unusual
expression,
your
honor.
it's
always
been
our
usual
term
for
it.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
in
this
case,
long
before
the
commissioner
of
education
became
involved
in
it,
what
happened
was
the
local
school
committee
agreed
that
the
child
concerned
should
be
placed
at
bradley
psychiatric
hospital,
and
so
the
school
committee
did
that.
then
the
school
committee
looked
at
the
situation
and
reevaluated
it
and
made
a
determination
that
there
was
another...
there
was
a
state
agency,
the
rhode
island
department
of
mental
health,
that
it
felt
under
certain
statutes
was
responsible
for
this
child's...
or
should
be
responsible
for
educating
or
placing
this
child
at
bradley
hospital.
so
the
school
committee
told
the
parents
that
the
school
committee
was
not
going
to
fund
that
placement,
not
going
to
provide
any
more
funds
for
that
placement,
which
of
course
would
result
in
that
placement
being
ended.
at
that
point
what
happened
in
the
case
was
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court,
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
first
complaint
speaks
of
equal
protection.
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
i
think
it
solely
speaks
to
procedural
due
process,
and
more
particularly,
the
basic
argument
of
this
complaint
was
simply
that
rhode
island
regulations,
rhode
island
special
ed
regulations,
which
even
though
the
handicapped
act
was
not
yet
in
effect
apparently
we
had
some
pre-knowledge
of
what
these
regulations
would
look
like,
so
it
looks
as
if
the
regulations
we
were
using
at
the
time
really
matched
the
ultimate
federal
handicapped
regulations.
under
those
regulations,
a
placement
couldn't
be
changed
unless
the
parents
consented
to
it
or
unless
they
were
granted
a
hearing
and
as
a
result
of
that
hearing
a
change
was
ordered.
well,
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
plaintiffs
felt
that
they
weren't
going
to
be
granted
that
hearing,
even
though
they
had
asked
for
it,
so
they
filed
the
complaint
in
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
judge
looked
at
the
complaint
and
he
said,
yes,
under
rhode
island
regulations
you
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
the
placement
can
be
terminated,
and
this
funding,
potential
funding
dispute
between
the
state
agencies
was
exactly
that
sort
of
funding
dispute
or
that
sort
of
change
in
placement
dispute
that
should
be
adjudicated
through
the
available
state
administrative
procedures.
so
the
federal
judge
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
to
keep
the
child
at
bradley
hospital
at
the
expense
of
the
school
committee
and
then
required
the
school
committee
to
conduct
a
due
process
hearing
as
required
by
rhode
island
administrative
special
education
regulations,
and
also
that
opportunity
should
be
given
the
parties
to
appeal
to
the
commissioner
of
education.
so
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honors.
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
local
school
committee,
an
administrative
sort
of
hearing.
the
school
committee
took
evidence
and
looked
at
the
matter,
and
they
resolved
in
a
written
decision
that
they
were
not
responsible
because
a
state
agency
was
responsible.
that
decision
was
then
appealed
to
the
commissioner
of
education,
who
held
a
de
novo
hearing,
acting
as
a
hearing
officer,
and
listened
to
both
sides.
now,
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
in
a
case...
and
by
then,
by
the
time
the
matter
reaches
the
commissioner
of
education,
the
handicapped
children's
act
is
in
force.
and
you'll
note
if
you
look
at
the
record,
one
of
the
complaints
the
plaintiffs
had
against
the
commissioner,
and
an
issue
on
which
they
lost,
they
were
arguing
that
he
couldn't
act
as
a
hearing
officer
under
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
act.
so
there
is
no
doubt
here,
the
plaintiffs
have
even
agreed,
that
this
was
a
hearing
pursuant
to
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
act
at
that
stage.
what
happened
was,
the
commissioner
heard
the
matter.
and
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
had
indicated
at
the
time
that
this
was
a
difficult
question
and
it
had
not
yet
resolved
the
issue.
so
that
left
the
commissioner
in
the
position
of
having
to
make
his
own
decision.
so
what
the
commissioner
did
was,
he
found
that
the
rhode
island
department
of
mental
health
should
have
been
educating
this
child.
that
was
his
decision.
now,
what
happened
after
that
was
the
plaintiffs
appealed
the
matter
to
federal
district
court.
they
took
the
matter
up
there,
arguing
that,
no,
it
was
not
the
department
of
mental
health,
but
rather
the
school
committee,
that
should
be
responsible.
now,
with
that
rhode
island
supreme
court
prior
precedent
that
i
mentioned,
indicating
that
this
was
a
difficult
issue,
i
was
involved
in
the
case
at
that
point
and
i
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
matter,
the
question,
be
certified
to
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
for
a
determination
as
to
who
was
responsible
and
who
wasn't.
and
so
then
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
came
down
with
a
decision
indicating
that,
that
in
fact
the
local
school
committee
was
responsible.
so
in
this
case
i
would
suggest
that
what
you
really
have,
it's
not
a
normal
special
ed
case.
what
you
have
is
a
state
level
hearing
officer
who
heard
a
case
and
he
decided
the
case
in
a
way
that
ultimately
was
not...
that
was
held
to
be
wrong
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
now,
because
he--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--as
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor.
and
the
strange
thing
about...
i
shouldn't
say...
the
interesting
thing
about
this
case,
if
you
read
one
of
the
later
opinions
of
the
district
court
in
this
matter,
he
said...
what
finally
happened
in
this
case
was,
once
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
rendered
its
decision,
which
from
my
perspective
ended
it...
i
don't
think
you
can
presume
that
state
agencies
are
not
going
to
follow
their
own
supreme
court.
plaintiffs,
though,
perhaps
wishing
to
have
some
sort
of
order
on
the
record,
looking
forward
to
some
sort
of
attorney's
fees,
requested
a
declaratory
judgment
declaring
that
the
commissioner's
decision
was
wrong.
i
still
don't
know
the
point
of
doing
that,
other
than
trying
to
form
a
basis
for
fees.
now,
the
court
ultimately
entered
that
sort
of
decision
and
declared,
for
whatever
purpose,
that
the
commissioner's
decision
was
wrong.
but
that
was
a
decision
by
the
commissioner
of
education
really
taken
entirely,
i
would
say,
in
essence
in
his
judicial
capacity.
and
you'll
note
in
one
of
the
district
court's
opinions,
the
district
court
makes
the
point
that
it
is
not
ruling
against
the
commissioner...
and
it
uses
these
words...
"on
any
basis
that
the
commissioner
ever
failed
to
enforce
state
law
or
failed
to
see
that
state
law
was
carried
out.
"
no,
the
court
rejected
that,
said
that
that
was
not
the
reason.
it
said
the
reason
why
it
was
acting
in
the
case
was
because
the
commissioner
had
rendered
this
decision,
and
it
gave
the
date
for
the
decision.
so
i
would
say
there's
no
doubt
that
all
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
pure
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
matter,
where
a
hearing
officer
acting
under
that
act
has
rendered
a
certain
decision.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
the
funds
were
about
to
be
withdrawn,
and
i
don't
know,
we
don't
know,
what
the
results
would
have
been.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
but
the
local
school
committee
had
withdrawn
the
funds.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
well,
i
think
the--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--the
funds
were
going
to
be
withdrawn,
which
would
terminate
that
placement.
but
the
rhode
island
commissioner
of
education
was
not
involved
in
the
dispute
at
that
point.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
yes,
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
he
did.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
what
the...
if
you
look
at
his
decision,
he
said
that
where
the
school
committee
has
gone
wrong
in
this
case,
it's
not
following
state
regulations.
and
i
think
failure
to
follow
state
regulations...
and
i
don't
know
how
valid
it
is...
failure
to
follow
state
regulations
is
a
violation
of
federal
due
process,
so
i'm
going
to
require--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--enough
to
keep
the--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--that's
the
only,
that
procedural
due
process
was
being
violated.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
as
i
understand
the
original
complaint.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
exactly,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
happened.
and
it
wasn't...
and
indeed,
the
district
court
at
one
point
observed--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--your
honor,
that
might
well,
as
the
first
circuit
indicated,
might...
i'm
not
conceding
the
point...
might
support
a
fee
award
against
the
school
committee.
but
the
school
committee
has
already
settled
this
matter,
and
you
note
what
the
school
committee
is
paying
for
is
for
the
fees
for
the
preliminary
injunction,
by
their
agreement,
fees
for
the
preliminary
injunction
and
fees
for
the
hearing
before
the
school
committee.
and
what
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
obtain
from
the
commissioner
are
fees
for
the
hearing
which
the
commissioner
conducted.
and
perhaps
he
ruled
in
favor
of
the
school
committee,
but
he
ruled,
that
was
the
position
of
the
school
committee.
i
think
we
were
just
acting
in
a
straightforward
judicial
capacity.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
they
do
mention
that
decision,
and
why
they
did
not...
why
they
did
not
follow
it
is
simply
this.
in
this
case,
as
the
plaintiffs,
as
the
petitioners
indicate,
they
are
not
arguing
that
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
act
is
enforceable
under
1983.
now,
that
would
be
the
straightforward
way
to
get
fees,
to
argue
that
it's
enforceable
under
1983
and
therefore
under
1988
you
should
get
fees.
but
they
never
raised
that
issue
in
this
case.
so
i
respectfully
submit
they're
trying
to
bring
the
fee
award
in
through
a
constitutional
back
door.
what
they're
saying
is--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--i
think
they
did
come
to
grips
with
it,
your
honor.
what
they
did
is,
they
said
that
if
you
have
an
action
that's
entirely
bottomed
on
a
federal
act,
such
as
the
1983
action,
which
in
itself
in
their
judgment
wouldn't
be
enforceable
under
1983,
they
in
essence
felt
that
if
you
couldn't
find
any
congressional
intent
to
enforce
it
through
1983
you
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
take
a
back
door
approach.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
case
where
in
our
judgment
the
constitutional
claims
are
really
the
same,
they're
consubstantial.
they're
really
the
same
claim
as
the
statutory
claim.
it's
not
really
that
they
are
in
any
way
different.
in
this
case
the
handicapped
procedures,
those
administrative
regulations,
that
was
resolved
in
that
process
who
was
responsible
for
educating
that
child.
that
was
resolved
through
a
statutory
procedure.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
well,
i
think
there
are
two
positions
there.
one,
i
would
think,
i
would
argue
that
in
fact
you
have
look
at
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
act
as
having
preclusive
effect.
just
looking
at
the
wide-ranging
nature
of
that
act--
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
--that
sort
of
left
it
that
this
act
was
obviously
meant...
it
prescribes
things
that
are
never
going
to
be
prescribed
constitutionally.
it
involves
the
development
of
individualized
education
programs
and
provision
of
related
services.
it's
a
very,
very
comprehensive
act,
and
i
just
don't
see
how
1983
comes
into
play.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
well,
what
they
were
saying
is
that
the
only
reason
why
these
constitutional
claims
were
added
from
the
commissioner's
perspective
was
sort
of
transparently,
i
would
suggest,
for
the
purpose
of
getting
attorney's
fees.
the
interesting
sort
of
issue
in
the
case
is
this:
you
could
raise
this
sort
of
constitutional
issue,
whatever
it
may
have
been...
i
don't
think
in
my
mind
it
was
ever,
assuming
that
it
existed,
it
was
ever
that
well
articulated...
and
there
was
no
real
way
that
anyone
could
ever
get
at
it.
i
think
that
in
the
old
siler
case
this
court
established
a
rule
about
avoiding
deciding
constitutional
questions,
and
the
purpose
of
that
rule
was
because
the
court
for
prudential
reasons
wanted
to
turn
away
from
deciding
those
issues,
recognizing
the
problems
you
get
with
constitutional
constructions.
when
you've
got
a
state...
when
you've
got
a
federal
statute
like
the
handicapped
children's
act,
it's
so
wide-ranging,
realistically
no
one
is
turning
away
from
deciding
the
difficult
constitutional
issue.
that's
not
really
involved
in
the
case.
everyone's
attention
is
simply
focused
on
the
statute.
so
that
rules
seems
to
be
potentiating
here
into
something
that
it
was
never
intended
to
involve,
the
fee
award
question.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
the
alleged
1983
constitutional
claim
is
coextensive
with
the
education
for
all
handicapped
children's
act,
we
can't
believe
the
1988
fee
provision
is
applicable.
i
also
want
to
point
out
briefly,
your
honor,
that
we've
raised
the
contention
that
the
commissioner
here
is
not
liable
for
fees
because
he
was
acting
in
a
judicial
capacity.
i
won't
belabor
that
point.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
we
would
contend
that
if
administrative
hearing
officers
are
going
to
be
put
in
a
position
where
they
or
their
agencies
are
going
to
have
to
pay
fees
depending
upon
how
they
decide
the
case,
that's
really
not
going
to
contribute
to
fair
and
equal
due
process
for
anyone.
finally,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
pennhurst
case
may
have
some
applicability
to
this
matter.
to
the
extent
that
this
question
was
ultimately
decided
on
state
law
grounds,
that
decision
suggests
that
perhaps
the
federal
district
court
shouldn't
have
gotten
involved
in
the
matter
in
the
first
place,
at
least
in
relation
to
the
commissioner's
decision.
now,
we
have
to
concede
that
we're
here
on
a
motion
for
attorney's
fees,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
there's
some
eleventh
amendment
immunity
applicable
in
this
case
that
it
should
be
applicable
even
now
on
the
question
of
attorney's
fees,
because
the
effectiveness
of
that
ruling
is
best
served
by
avoiding...
by
nullifying
federal
judicial
actions,
which
in
essence,
on
the
basis
of
a
state
court,
state
supreme
court
decision,
it
just
goes
out
of
its
way
to
reverse,
for
no
very
good
reason
perhaps,
a
decision
of
an
administrative
hearing
officer.
mr.
forrest
l.
avila
i
would
be...
well,
that
might
be
true.
i'm
hard-pressed
to
say
that
since
i,
in
the
original
case,
i
was
the
one
that
moved
it
in
the
first
place,
and
we
thought
it
was
a
serious
issue
that
should
be
decided
by
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.

well,
pennhurst
was...
could
have
been,
could
be
wrong.
but
i
think
that
it
was
something
we'd
still
have
to
do
again,
because
it's
a
vital
state
issue,
and
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
had
to
have,
i
think
properly
had
to
have,
the
final
say
on
that
issue.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
