unknown
speaker
i
do
have
a
question,
actually,
counsel.
did
you
cite
the
griggs
decision
of
last
term
in
connection
with
this,
interpreting
rule
4(a)(4)?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
the
griggs
result
creates
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
you
sat
they
abandoned
that
appeal.
do
you
mean
they
abandoned
that
prong
of
their
attack
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
standard
which
you
attribute
to
appellee
as
the
narrowest
possibly
tailored
is
really
the
standard
that
applies
to
the
government
as
regulator,
isn't
it,
not
to
the
government
as
expending
public
funds.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
held,
for
instance,
in
cases
like
regan
v.
taxation
with
representation,
united
states
postal
service
v.
greenberg
and
cases
like
that
that
where
the
government
isn't
acting
as
lawgiver
in
the
sense
of
regulating
private
individuals,
but
instead,
deciding
how
it
is
going
to
put
its
property
to
use
or
how
it
is
going
to
spend
its
money,
the
standards
are
a
good
deal
more
lenient.
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
make
that
spending
power
argument
below?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
say
that,
you
can't
also
be
arguing,
well,
all
they
have
to
do
is
give
up
the
money,
and
they
can...
because
your
argument
really
would
extend
a
blanket
prohibition
against
editorializing
by
public
stations.
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
basic
argument
would
really
apply
not
merely
to
public
television
but
to
all
licensed
television,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
this
parallel,
that
in
both
areas
the
government
has
the
power
to
say
you
cannot
continue
to
broadcast.
i
mean,
because
even
in
the
private
sector
they
have
the
licensing
power.
unknown
speaker
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
mean
the
united
states
government,
though--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
alito,
are
you
suggesting
that
a
state
operated
public
broadcasting
system
or
station
is
subject
to
more
federal
regulation
under
the
constitution
than
a
privately
owned...
well,
there
can't
be
a
privately
owned
one,
can
there?
you
say
there
can't
be
a
privately...
say,
is
a
state
operated
station
subject
to
more
regulation
under
the
constitution
than
a
station
owned
by
a
nonprofit
private
corporation?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if,
say,
the
state
of
alabama
or
the
city
of
birmingham,
whatever
the
other,
say
we
would
like
our
station
to
editorialize?
unknown
speaker
do
they
allow
debates
on
local
controversial
issues
if
the
city
municipal
corporation
owns
the
station?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
that
avoid
ideology
then?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
carry
the
red
lion
concept
way
beyond
what
it...
the
way
it
regulates
private
profit
stations.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
for
a
newspaper
if
it
received
some
kind
of
public
subsidy?
unknown
speaker
it
perhaps
may
subsidize
them
indirectly
through
tax
benefits
of
some
kind
or
deductions.
unknown
speaker
postage
rates.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
they
are
not
consequential?
the
weekly
news
magazines
couldn't
function
if
they
didn't
get
the
special
rates,
stay
in
business.
unknown
speaker
it
is
an
indirect
subsidy.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
many
communities
there
is
only
one
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
changing?
aren't
there
far
more
frequencies
available
today
than
in
the
past?
unknown
speaker
the
government
doesn't
have
to
rely
only
on
the
red
lion,
does
it?
i
mean,
it
can
rely
also
on
the
right
of
any
contributor
to
attach
strings
to
its
contributions.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
your
position
then
be
that
as
long
as
the
station
isn't
using
the
public
money
for
the
editorializing
aspect,
that
it
is
all
right?
unknown
speaker
i
am
puzzled
but
this
argument.
it
seems
to
me
the
very
test
of
what
can't
be
broadcast
is
a
content...
is
defined
in
terms
of
content:
that
you
can't
give
editorial.
unknown
speaker
but
you
surely
couldn't
tell
whether
the
program
you
listen
to
were
an
editorial
or
not
without
listening
to
its
content,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that,
mr.
alito,
when
apart
from
funding,
the
broadcaster
may
editorialize?
unknown
speaker
but
it
might
be
funded
by
state
funds
or
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
which
do
not
receive
federal
funding?
unknown
speaker
i
am
frank
to
say
what
i
am
bothered
about
with
your
case
is
that
it
is
a
complete
ban
on
editorializing
in
an
area
that
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
therefore
it
is
a
little
different
from,
say,
harris
v.
mcrae.
is
the
rationale
behind
this
statute
much
the
same
in
your
view
as
behind
the
statute
that
forbids
usia
broadcasts,
which
go
to
all...
many
other
countries,
but
they
cannot...
the
same
material
cannot
be
broadcast
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
when
you
make
that
statement,
you
are
speaking
of
political
propagandizing,
or
just
usia,
voice
of
america
type
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
do
you
think
a
station
would
be
free
to
retain
a
prominent
commentator
who
appeared
regularly
on
the
station
advancing
political
views?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
have
any
less
influence
doing
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
is
your
response
to
justice
powell
then
that
in
your
view
or...
it
must
be
your
view
that
these
national
commentators
are
totally
unbiased
and
nonpolitical.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
that
would
be
proper
to
use
some
of
these
shows
that
appear
on
the
three
networks,
the
three
commercial
networks.
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
really
shut
one
door
and
left
about
five
doors
open,
didn't
it,
for
anybody,
any
station
that
wants
to
put
on
various
partisan
views.
ao
long
as
they
are
not
the
partisan
views
of
management,
they
can
be
put
on.
unknown
speaker
but
which
isn't...
the
fairness
doctrine
isn't
attacked
here,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
so
far.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
appeared
that
this
management
of
one
of
these
public
stations
was
over
a
period
of
time,
it
was
demonstrated
that
he
selected,
he
or
she
selected
commentators
whose
view
was
all
one
way,
either
on
domestic
tax
policy
or
economic
policy
or
foreign
policy?
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
only
the
fairness
doctrine
would
be
a
limitation
on
them,
that
they
would
have
to,
if
they
could
find
one,
find
a
commentator
the
other
day.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that...
i
take
it
it
must
be...
that
the
fairness
doctrine
is
not
sufficient
protection?
unknown
speaker
and
why?
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
by
that
that
the
city
of
new
york
or
the
city
of
chicago
can
own
and
control
a
public
station
and
let
the
mayor
of
the
town
have
special
rights
for
broadcasting
and
have
his
views
advocated
over
opposing
views?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
woocher,
you
agree,
i
take
it,
that
the
government
could
say
we
are
going
to
give
you
35
percent
of
your
operating
funds,
and
you
can't
use
any
of
those
funds
for
editorializing.
unknown
speaker
okay,
now,
supposing
the
government
does
that
and
they
see
that
the
station
is
just
switching
the
government
funds
over
to
something
else
and
pulling
of
some
other
funds
and
using
the
private
funds
to
editorialize,
and
the
government
says,
well,
we
are
trying
to
have
some...
we
want
to
discourage
editorializing.
the
way
we
are
allotting
the
money
isn't
doing
any
good.
so
then
the
government
says
let's
make
it
mean
something.
so
we
say,
we
will
give
you
35
percent
if
you
won't
editorialize.
now,
what
is
so
different
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
answer
is
inconsistent
with
our
opinion
in
regan
last
year,
regan
v.
taxation
without
representation.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
don't
see
this
case
as
involving
any
suppression
of
"dangerous
views"
at
all.
no
particular
views
are
suppressed.
the
station
is
just
told
it
cannot
adopt
an
editorial
policy,
whatever
that
policy
might
be.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
a
spending
power
case.
you
are
treating
this...
consolidated
edison
wasn't
a
spending
power
case.
you
are
treating
this
as
if
the
government
had
said
to
all
private
stations,
whether
they
get
government
funding
or
not,
all
public
stations,
you
can't
do
this.
the
government
didn't
say
that.
it
is
saying
only
the
ones
that
get
government
can't
do
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
that
certainly
regan
did
not
cover
the
situation,
the
distinction
you
make
because
it
was
not
present
in
regan.
but
what
you
are
saying
is
that
though
the
government
may
do
something
in
an
ineffectual
way
that
doesn't
have
any
result
because
the
people
just
switched
the
funds,
it
can't
do
it
in
an
effectual
way.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
government's
own
choice
there.
the
government
is
saying
we
will
do
this,
and
if
you
want
to
switch
funds,
that's
okay.
here
the
government
has
said
we
don't
want
to
risk
your
switching
funds.
why
shouldn't
that
be
a
decision
of
congress
rather
than
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
suppose
a
station
just
couldn't
exist
without
public
money,
that
it
just
would
go
out
of
business,
and
it
is
absolutely
essential
for
the
station
to
receive
government
money.
so
if
it
is
going
to
editorialize
or
do
anything
else,
it
has
to
have
the
government
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
certainly,
i
would
think,
would
read
against
you,
because
if
you
are
so
dependent
upon
the
sources
of
funds,
if
you
could
editorialize,
you
would
be
bound
to
express
the
financier's
view.
unknown
speaker
that's
part
of
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
making
an
argument
though,
here
in
this
court
and
in
your
brief,
that
this
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
all
you
really
need
to
represent
your
client,
to
win
for
your
client
is
to
have
it
be
held
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
your
client.
but
why
would
you
say
that's
necessarily
true
countrywide?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
no
station
that
you
can
think
of
in
the
country
that
wouldn't
be
shut
down
if
government
money
was
cut
off?
i
guess
that
just
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--that
isn't
reality,
mr.
woocher.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
must...
now
you
have
to
say
that,
but
i
was
just...
so
that
was
your
answer
to
my
original
question,
that
it
is
just
irrelevant
that
the
station
would
shut
down
without
the
money.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
promise
not
to
express
our
views.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
promise
not
to
express
our
views.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
you
cannot
have
the
government
fund
a
broadcast
station
in
this
country
to
advance
the
views
of
that
government,
would
you
not
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
agree
with
it,
or
you
do
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
buy
air,
that's
quite
different,
buying
air
time.
why,
then,
do
we
forbid,
does
congress
forbid
any
broadcast
of
the
usia,
the
voice
of
america,
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
not
exist,
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
white
gave
you,
some
of
them
at
least
could
not
exist
without
the
government's
support,
is
that
not
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
station
which
got
100
percent
of
its
funds
from
the
federal
government
not
be
a
governmental
entity?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
statute
forbidding
the
use
of
voice
of
america
broadcasts
within
the
united
states
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt
you,
if
i
may.
you
say
that
the
first
amendment
poses
no
restriction
on
what
the
government
may
do
with
its
own
speech.
so
if
the
government
decided
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
advancing
the
interests
of
the
republican
party,
that
would
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
may
be
limits.
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
they
limits
imposed
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
are
they
not
limits
imposed
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
say
it
categorically.
you
just
think
there
may
be?
well
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
government
gave
this
money
to
these
stations
and
said
provided
you
put
on
editorials
that
we
will
send
you
in
the
mail,
now,
you
know
that
wouldn't
be
permitted,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
one
answer
to
justice
stevens.
yes,
you
were
arguing
before
that
it
would
be
permitted,
if
i
heard
your
correctly.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
scarcity
rationale
the
distinction
between
the
government's
ability
to
regulate
broadcasting
and
the
government's
ability
to
regulate
a
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
no
limit
on
how
many
pieces
of
paper
you
can
print
or
distribute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
are
there
any...
does
the
record
have
any
fats
in
it
about
your
client,
this
station,
its
economics
and
how
important
the
government
funding
is
to
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
about
all
there
is?
is
that
about
the
only
fact
about
like
that?
unknown
speaker
and
no
basis
for
knowing
that
if
the
government
funding
was
removed,
that
it
would
or
wouldn't
stay
in
existence.
it
was
in
existence
before
it
received
any
money,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
facts
are
in
the
record
about
pacifica.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
would
it
be
any
different,
would
the
rule
of
law
you
are
advocating
be
any
different
if
it
is
80
percent
funding
instead
of
20
percent?
unknown
speaker
well
you
would
rather
that
there
was
such
a
difference
than
to
lose
this
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
would
rather
have
such
a
difference
recognized
than
to
lose
this
case
for
our
client,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true,
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
do
you
regard
399
as
a
content-based
regulation?
unknown
speaker
that
bears
on
the
standard,
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
of
which
types
do
they
gather,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
does
pacifica
publish
commercial
advertising?
unknown
speaker
is
it
because
it
is
forbidden
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
only
its
program
is
restricted.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
to
me
like
that
is
a...
if
editorializing
is
content
based,
so
is
that.
unknown
speaker
what
other
kind
of
program
restrictions
are
there
besides
forbidding
commercial
advertising?
unknown
speaker
except
what
might
be
imposed
by
the
fairness
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
whatever
those
are.
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
in
reading
judge
lucas'
opinion,
i
didn't
get
a
clear
idea
of
just
what
it
was
that
pacifica
wanted
to
do
by
way
of
editorializing
that
it
can't
do
under
399.
i
mean,
is
it
a
30
second
thing
once
a
day
or
a
five
minute
thing
every
hour?
does
the
record
show?
unknown
speaker
does
it
show
that
it
has
exercised
it
in
the
past?
unknown
speaker
if
pacifica
was
not
going
to
do
anything
that
would
be
barred
by
the
statute,
presumably
there
is
no
dispute.
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
not
editorialized
up
to
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes.
i
wasn't
asking
you
why
it
hadn't.
i
was
just
asking
whether
or
not
it
had.
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
has
it
refrained
from
editorializing?
unknown
speaker
so
it
has
been
not
editorializing
for
16
years.
unknown
speaker
and
thriving?
unknown
speaker
well
it
is
hard
to
thrive
if
you
can't
make
any
profit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
it
hasn't
done
it
for
16
years,
it
probably
doesn't
know
itself.
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
i
suppose
your
client
could
use
the
government
money
to
produce
its
own
program
about
drug
abuse.
unknown
speaker
and
have
20
or
30
people
who
are
hired
as
part
of
that
production
to
express
views
about
drug
abuse.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
it
is
different,
but
nevertheless,
you
can...
you
are
not
forbidden
from
influencing...
exerting
your
influence
in
this
area
through
producing
your
own
shows,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
yes.
suppose
it
had
a
series
of
documentaries,
alleged
documentaries,
saying
that
after
all
these
years
of
experiments
with
segregation,
desegregation,
that
the
conclusion
had
been
reached
that
it
was
better
for
the
races
to
be
segregated,
with
the
advent
of
new
asiatics
coming
in,
the
asiatics
should
go
to
one
school,
and
so
forth?
what
about
that?
do
you
think
that
would
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
they
could
deal
with
the
fellow
that
advocated
reversing
the
desegregation
program
in
this
country
would
be
to
have
someone
present
the
other
side,
the
other
point
of
view.
unknown
speaker
under
the
united
church
of
christ
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
woocher,
the
government
contends
that
there
is
some
real
danger
that
if
a
station
is
editorializing,
that
the
government
might
be
blamed
for
the
views
expressed.
they
want
to
avoid
that
possibility.
how
are
these
monies...
what
is
the
route
that
is
followed
in
passing
out
these
monies
to
these
stations?
who...
nobody
in
the
administration
hands
it
out,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
who
is
that?
unknown
speaker
and
who
else?
who
else
has
a
hand
in
it,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
the
president
who
appoints
them?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
staggered
terms?
unknown
speaker
who
makes
the
decisions
in
pbs?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
cpb,
that's
what
i
meant.
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
decide
who
does
it
inside?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
entire
board
votes
on
every
grant?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
who
is...
if
the
public...
if
your
client
gets
some
money,
who
makes
the
decision
whether
it
is
going
to
get
it?
i
mean,
what
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
ever
get
on
the
list,
just
by
being
a
public
broadcasting
company?
unknown
speaker
so
nobody
can...
you
don't
have
to
be
admitted
to
a
favorite
group.
you
are
there
already
and
it
is
just...
and
you
are
going
to
be
there
until
you
get
thrown
out.
unknown
speaker
and
so
i
suppose
part
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
very
little
chance
of
being
influenced
anyway.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
editorials
criticizing
funding
decisions
could
ever
have
an
impact
on
funding
decisions?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
possible.
unknown
speaker
even
persuasive
editorials
having
such--
unknown
speaker
--and
your
client,
i
take
it,
wouldn't
object
to,
if
it
is
going
to
editorialize,
to
give
people
an
opportunity
to
state
the
contrary
view.
unknown
speaker
in
the
hypothetical
example,
that
means
you
would
give
time
to
somebody
advocating
drug
abuse.

unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
possible
problem?
