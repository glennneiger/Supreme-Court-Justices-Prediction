mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
47
u.s.c.
section
399
which
prohibits
editorializing
by
those
public
television
and
radio
stations
that
receive
federal
subsidies
from
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting.
this
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
which
invalidated
section
399.
appellees
have
raised
a
question
about
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
and
the
court
has
postponed
further
consideration
of
the
jurisdictional
issue
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
we
have
fully
briefed
the
jurisdictional
issue,
and
therefore,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
on
that
matter,
i
will
move
directly
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes.
that,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
principal
bases
upon
which
appellees
rely.
but
of
course,
the
appellate
rules
do
not
govern
appeals
to
this
court,
and
there
is
a
provision
in
4(a)(4)
which
is
noticeably
absent
from
this
court's
rules,
and
that
provision
says
that
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
while
certain
post-trial
motions
are
pending
is
a
nullity.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
this
court's
rules.
as
i
understand
it,
the
rule
prior
to
the
1980
amendment
of
the
appellate
rules
which
added
that
provision
was
that
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
under
those
circumstances
would
be
valid,
and
therefore,
i
would
believe
that
the
absence
of
such
a
rule
in
this
court's
rules
means
that
our
notice
of
appeal
here
is
valid.
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
think
there
is
a
question
whether
rule
4(a)(4)
applies
to
interlocutory
appeals,
even
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
but
in
any
event,
as
i
said,
that
rule
does
not
apply
to
appeals
to
this
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
creates
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
and
when
there
is
no
provision
in
the
governing
rules
pointing
that
trap
out,
it
is
all
the
more
dangerous
and
unfair.
there
is
nothing
in
this
court's
rules
that
say
that
a
notice
of
appeal
filed
while
a
motion
for
reconsideration
is
pending
is
a
nullity,
and
i
think
that
to
reach
that
result
in
this
case
would
frustrate
the
intent
of
section
1252
under
which
we
appealed,
which
of
course
is
to
allow
a
speedy
and
authoritative
disposition
of
questions
involving
the
constitutionality
of
acts
of
congress.
if
that
had
to
wait
while
a
collateral
matter
like
attorneys'
fees
was
decided,
i
think
congress'
intent
would
be
frustrated.
for
example,
here
nearly
a
year
went
by
while
the
attorneys'
fees
question
was
being
decided
by
the
district
court.
moving
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
section
399
has
two
separate
provisions.
the
first
provision
which
is
directly
attacked
here
today
of
course
provides,
as
i
said,
that
stations
receiving
federal
funds
from
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
may
not
engage
in
editorializing.
in
fact,
every
public
television
station
at
last
count,
and
virtually
every
full
service
public
radio
station
receives
such
funds.
the
term
editorializing
has
been
authoritatively
construed
by
the
fcc,
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
to
mean
only
the
official
endorsement
of
views
by
station
management,
and
therefore,
section
399
does
not
prohibit
the
discussion
of
any
topic
or
the
expression
of
any
viewpoint.
station
employees,
journalists,
commentators,
public
officials
and
everybody
else
can
express
their
views
on
any
subject.
the
only
thing
that
cannot
be
said
is
this
editorial
represents
the
position
of
station
management,
or
something
to
that
effect.
and
of
course,
a
station
can
say
even
that
if
only
it
is
willing
to
give
up
federal
funds.
if
these
funds
are
as
insubstantial
as
appellees
and
the
district
court
suggest,
then
that
should
not
represent
a
major
sacrifice.
there
is
a
second
provision
of
399
that
is
not
directly
challenged
here
today,
but
we
believe
it
is
nevertheless
very
much
at
issue,
and
that
provision
prohibits
public
stations
from
supporting
or
opposing
candidates
for
office.
now,
appellees
originally
challenged
that
provision
as
well
and
advanced
almost
the
same
arguments
they
now
advance
in
this
court
in
attacking
the
first
provision
of
section
399.
but
they
abandoned
that
appeal
with
pacifica
saying
that
at
least
for
the
present
it
has
no
intention
of
supporting
or
opposing
candidates.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes,
i
misspoke,
justice
rehnquist.
they
amended
their
complaint.
but
the
argument
that
they
have
made
in
this
court
that
section
399
can
survive
only
if
it
is
the
most
narrowly
drawn
statute
designed
to
serve
a
compelling
governmental
interest
would
surely
call
for
the
invalidation
of
the
second
provision
of
section
399
as
well
if
it
calls
for
the
invalidation
of
the
first.
and
indeed,
that
argument
is
so
broad
that
it
calls
into
question
virtually
all
of
the
special
rules
that
apply
to
public
stations
as
well
as
rules
like
the
fairness
doctrine
that
apply
to
all
broadcasters.
appellees
play
a
kind
of
hide
and
seek
game
with
this
regulatory
structure.
they
deploy,
as
they
said,
a
first
amendment
argument
that
seems
to
require
that
most
of
it
be
swept
away,
yet
at
the
same
time
they
rely
on
these
regulations,
including
the
second
provision
of
section
399
to
show
that
the
provision
on
editorializing
is
unnecessary.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
certainly
is,
and
that
is
our
second
argument
in
this
case.
section
399
does
not
prohibit
a
public
station
from
editorializing.
it
simply
says
that
if
it
wants
to
do
so,
it
can't
receive
funds
from
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
we
did
not
couch
it
in
those
terms,
but
we
certainly
pointed
out
and
relied
upon
the
fact
of
government
funding,
and
the
district
court
addressed
that
question,
and
i
don't
really
think
that
the
spending
power
raises
a
different
question.
it's
just
an
aspect
of
the
same
larger
question,
whether
section
399
violates
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
that
is
the
same
question
whether
the
affirmative
basis
for
congress'
action
is
the
spending
power
or
the
commerce
power.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
we
are
making
two
arguments,
justice
stevens.
we
believe
that
section
399
was
constitutional
as
originally
enacted
in
1967,
and
we
believe
it
is
all
the
more
constitutional
as
amended
in
1981.
in
fact,
i
think
the
effect
of
the
amendment
in
practical
terms
was
very
slight
since
substantially
all
stations
receive
these
funds,
and
it
was
congress'
belief
in
1967
that
they
would
receive
those
funds.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
not
at
all,
justice
stevens.
nothing
in
our
submission
has
any
implications
for
commercial
broadcasting.
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
that
public
broadcasting
is
very
different
in
many
ways
from
commercial
broadcasting.
it
was
created
for
a
different
purpose,
and
it
is
dominated
by
government
entanglements
that
have
no
parallel
whatsoever
in
the
world
of
public
broadcast...
of
commercial
broadcasting.
and
it
is
that
which
supports
the
constitutionality.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that
is
certainly
true,
and
the
government
has
considerable
power
over
all
broadcasting
that
it
doesn't
possess
with
respect
to
the
print
media.
i
think
this
court's
cases
have
recognized
that
the
government's
power
with
respect
to
all
broadcasting
permits
restrictions
on
the
right
to
editorialize.
the
right
to
editorialize
is
also
the
right
not
to
editorialize,
as
the
court
said
in
miami
herald
company
v.
tornillo,
but
commercial
broadcasters
are
encouraged
to
editorialize,
and
they
have
to
give
up
time
for
reply
under
certain
circumstances
when
they
make
an
attack
on
an
individual
or
a
group
or
they
support
or
oppose
a
candidate.
that
is
a
restriction
on
editorializing
that
would
not
be
tolerated
in
the
print
media.
the
question
here
is
whether
a
further
restriction
on
editorializing
that
section
399
puts
into
effect
is
justified
by
the
special
characteristics
of
public
broadcasting.
let
me
turn
to
those
special
characteristics.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
matter
of
funding.
sixty-seven
percent
of
the
income
of
public
radio
comes
from
direct
government
subsidies,
and
approximately
60
percent
of
the
income
of
public
television--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
lunch
i
was
beginning
to
talk
about
the
enormous
differences
between
public
broadcasting
which
is
involved
here,
and
the
commercial
sphere
of
the
industry,
with
which
this
court
is
perhaps
more
familiar
due
to
its
prior
decision.
appellee
has
tried
to...
the
appellees
have
tried
to
suggest
in
this
case
that
public
stations
are
generally
just
like
commercial
stations:
they
are
free
to
do
and
say
whatever
they
want
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
ill-motivated
restriction
contained
in
section
399,
and
that
is
simply
not
true.
public
stations
are
subject
to
many
special
restrictions
designed
to
ensure
that
they
remain
true
to
their
intended
purpose
and
fulfill
their
public
mission.
for
example,
they
may
not
be
profit-making
institutions.
they
can
only
be
licensed
to
units
of
government
and
non-profit
groups.
they
may
not
sell
air
time
even
for
political
or
public
affairs
programming.
they
may
not
accept
advertising,
even
political
advertising.
they
have...
they
are
subject
to
special
equal
employment
opportunity
rules,
special
accounting
rules,
special
open
meeting
requirements.
they
have
to
have
community
advisory
boards
to
review
their
programming
and
see
if
they
are
serving
the
needs
of
the
entire
community.
now,
before
lunch,
before
lunch
i
started
to
talk
about
the
matter
of
funding,
and
of
course,
that
is
critical
here.
i
pointed
out
that
fully
60
percent
of
the
income
of
public
broadcasting
comes
from
direct
government
grants,
and
that
is
really
only
the
beginning.
virtually
every
public
television
station
facility
in
this
country
was
built
with
substantial
federal
funds,
and
many
of
public
broadcasting's
most
popular
shows,
such
as
sesame
street,
are
financed
with
federal
dollars
and
are
supplied
to
these
stations
at
no
cost
or
less
than
cost.
and
then,
of
course,
there
are
the
huge
tax
subsidies
that
these
stations
receive
by
virtue
of
their
tax-exempt
status.
appellees
have
attempted
to
disparage
the
significance
of
the
federal
contribution
to
public
stations,
but
on
this
point
i
think
i
will
let
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
speak
for
itself.
in
its
latest
annual
report,
it
says
flatly,
general
tax
revenues
are
the
linchpin
of
a
viable
american
public
broadcasting
service.
and
then
there
is
the
question
of
ownership.
two-thirds
of
these
stations
are
actually
owned
outright
by
units
of
government
or
by
government
instrumentalities.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
not
by
the
federal
government,
but
by
state
and
local
governments,
and
typically,
by
boards
or
authorities
that
state
government
sets
up
to
run
these
stations.
let
me
take
just
one
example,
the
example
of
alabama,
just
because
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--section
399
does
not
draw
that
sort
of
distinction,
but
our
argument
is
that
congress
was
legislating
against
the
backdrop
of
the
type
of
public
broadcasting
system
it
intended
to
create,
and
it
envisioned
the
fact
that
many
of
these
stations
were
going
to
be
governmentally
owned.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
i
think
the
congress
in
regulating
broadcasting
can
take
into
account
the
kinds
of
abuses
that
may
develop
when
a
publicly
owned
station
using
public
funds,
even
state
or
local
funds,
engages
in
editorializing
and
supporting
or
opposing
candidates.
i
think
that
creates
the
possibility
of
grave
abuses
that
are
not
present,
certainly
in
the
area
of
commercial
broadcasting.
it
creates
the
danger
that
the
station
will
be
used
as
an
outlet
for
government
propagandizing,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
the
first
amendment
tries
to
prevent
is
government
at
any
level
drowning
out
private
voices
in
the
media
of
communication.
it
creates
the
possibility
that
people
will
go
into
public
broadcasting
not
because
they
are
primarily
concerned
with
excellence
and
diversity
in
broadcasting,
which
was
the
purpose
for
the
public
broadcasting
act,
but
because
they
are
interested
in
pushing
a
particular
partisan
or
ideological
message.
that's
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--absolutely.
they
are
allowed
to
broadcast
any
view
on
any
issue,
and
anybody
can
speak
in
an
individual
capacity
or
representing
any
group
save
one,
and
that
is
the
management
of
the
station.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
because
it
avoids
the
labeling
by
the
station
of
a
particular
view
as
official.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
does
carry
the
reasoning
of
red
lion
a
step
further,
and
it
does
that
because
these
are
public
stations.
they
are
not
financed
with
private
advertising
dollars;
they
are
financed
in
large
measure
by
money
that
is
supplied
by
the
taxpayers,
and
it
would
in
many
ways
be
fundamentally
unfair
if
public
money
were
used
to
propagate
a
single,
narrow
set
of
partisan
or
ideological
views.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
if
newspapers
received
subsidies
of
this
order,
i
suppose
some
of
the
same
arguments
could
be
made,
but
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
because
it
presupposes
a
world
of
publishing
that
is
alien
to
what
we
have
always
known.
the
federal
government
does
not
subsidize
the
print
media
in
any
way
that
resembles
the
subsidies
that
are
given
to
public--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it,
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
know
appellees
have
relied
on
postage
rates.
i
seriously
question
whether
those
are
subsidies
of
any
sort,
and
in
any
event--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
they
operate
in
a
very
different
way
from
the
subsidies
here.
they
allow...
they
are
not
in
intended
to
subsidize
the
publication.
they
are
intended
to
make
it--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--their
purpose
is
to
make
it
less
expensive
for
an
individual
to
receive
the
publication
of
his
choice,
and
if
i
like
popular
mechanics
and
i
don't
like
field
and
stream,
i
can't
complain
because
my
neighbor
gets
field
and
stream
at
a
slightly
lower
price
because
i
get
the
same
break
on
popular
mechanics.
but
here,
most
communities
have
a
single
public
television
station
and
a
single
public
radio
station,
and
therefore,
if
my
tax
money
is
used
to
subsidize
a
station
that
continually
espouses
causes
that
i
disagree
with
and
candidacies
that
i
oppose,
then
i
am
going
to
take
objection.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that
is
not
due
to
the
fact
of
government
regulation
in
any
sense,
and
not
due
to
the
fact
of
government
subsidy.
this
court
has
relied
on
the
scarcity
of
broadcast
frequencies
to
justify
restrictions.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
are,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
think
there
is
still
a
scarcity
with
respect
to
the
most
valuable
frequencies,
vhf
television
stations,
for
example,
in
the
most
desirable
markets.
and
i
think
in
any
event
that
is
a
judgment
for
congress
to
make.
congress
certainly
has
not
abandoned
the
scheme
of
licensing
broadcasters
in
the
public
interest
which
rests
upon
an
idea
of
frequency
scarcity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
absolutely,
justice
rehnquist,
and
let
me
turn
then
to
that
point.
as
i
said,
section
399
does
not
prohibit
a
station
from
editorializing.
it
simply
says
if
you
want
to
editorialize,
you
have
to
do
it
with
private
money.
congress
has
frequently
enacted
statutes
like
this
which
condition
the
receipt--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--no,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
that
is
artificial
economics.
federal
support
assists
every
aspect
of
station
operations,
and
as
the
sentence
i
read
from
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
report
indicates,
in
many
instances
it
is
absolutely
vital
for
the
continued
existence
of
public
stations
in
their
present
form.
therefore,
if
there
were
no
such
support,
in
many
cases
there
would
be
no
antenna,
there
would
be
no
studio,
there
would
be
no
employees,
and
it
would
not
really
make
very
much
difference
if
the
station
could
draw
from
private
funds,
the
small,
direct
incremental
amount
necessary
to
broadcast
the
editorial.
if
funded
public
stations
were
permitted
to
editorialize,
given
the
nature
of
funding
for
public
broadcasting,
the
federal
government
would
necessarily
be
subsidizing
that
editorializing,
and
that
is
one
of
the
chief
things
that
congress
sought
to
prevent.
now,
appellees'
argument
is
that
section
399
is
unconstitutional
because
it
attaches
an
unconstitutional
condition
to
the
receipt
of
federal
money,
and
they
rely
on
cases
like
speiser
v.
randall
and
perry
v.
sindermann,
and
sherbert
v.
verner,
but
those
cases
i
think
are
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
one
on
at
least
three
major
grounds.
first
of
all,
this
section
399
is
not
in
any
way
content-related.
it
does
not
prevent
anybody
from
expressing
any
view
or
discussing
any
topic.
an
argument
very
similar
to
appellees'
was
made
to
this
court
in
fcc
v.
national
citizens
committee
for
broadcasting
in
which
the
court
considered
the
constitutionality
of
regulations
that
prohibited
newspapers
from
getting
broadcast
licenses
in
the
same
market,
and
the
court
unanimously
rejected
on
the
ground
that
the
regulations
there
were
not
content-related.
and
that
distinguished
speiser
in
that
line
of
authority.
and
i
think
this--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
i
think
a
measure
is
content-related,
as
i
said,
if
it
restrictions
the
expression
of
any
view
or
the
discussion
of
a
topic,
and
section
399
does
not
do
that
it
simply
says
you
cannot
editorialize.
it
concerns
the
packaging
of
expression
rather
than
its
content.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
it
is
not
content-related
in
the
senses
that
i
believe
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
in
its
opinions.
the
speiser
line
of
authority
is
distinguishable
in
any
event,
i
think,
on
two
other
grounds.
first
of
all,
section
399,
as
i
said,
prevents
the
use
of
federal
money
to
subsidize
editorializing,
given
the
nature
of
the
funding
that
public
broadcasting
receives,
and
in
speiser
and
those
other
cases
there
was
no
real
question
of
subsidy.
in
speiser,
for
example,
taxpayers
were
denied
a
property
tax
exemption
that
was
given
to
honorably
discharged
veterans,
and
they
were
denied
that
on
the
ground
that
they
refused
to
sign
a
loyalty
oath.
well,
you
certainly
couldn't
say
that
the
property
tax
exemption,
if
it
had
been
given,
would
be
subsidizing
their
refusal
to
sign
the
loyalty
oath,
and
i
think
that
is
true
of
the
other
cases
upon
which
appellees
have
relied.
and
finally,
the
restriction
here
is
closely
related
to
the
purposes
for
congress'
funding.
it
is
not
simply
an
extraneous
limitation
that
is
tacked
on.
it
helps
to
ensure
that
public
broadcasting
remains
true
to
its
intended
purpose.
it
helps
to
preserve
the
public,
nonpartisan
character
that
is
essential
for
public
broadcasting.
and--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question,
justice
blackmun.
if
a
station
does
not
receive
funding,
it
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
in
fact,
every
station,
with
a
few
exceptions
in
the
field
of
radio,
does
receive
that
funding,
and
thus,
the
statute--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
the
pattern
is
that
these
stations
receive
funds
from
a
diversity
of
public
sources.
they
receive
about
25
percent
of
their
funds--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
don't
know
whether
there
are
any
that
do
not
receive
federal
funding.
we
know
that
all
public
television
stations
receive
corporation
for
public
broadcasting
grants,
and
then
90
percent
of
the
public
radio
stations
that
are
qualified
for
those
grants...
and
that
is
generally
the
professional,
full-service
stations.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
principal
bases
for
this
statute,
to
prevent
the
use
of
these
stations
for
government
propagandizing.
and
i
think
it
is
naive
to
believe
that
a
medium
that
gets
fully
60
percent
of
its
income
from
government
sources
could
take
editorial
positions
and
support
or
oppose
candidates
without
taking
into
account
the
wishes
of
those
who
control
the
purse
strings.
and
in
the
case
of
those
stations
that
are
owned
outright
by
local
government,
i
think
that
the
argument
has
all
the
more
force.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
the
statute
is
concerned
with
political
influence
of
all
types,
whether
it
comes
from
the
federal
government
or
from
state
and
local
government.
when
congress
enacted
section
399,
it
received
some
very
compelling
testimony
by
people
who
operated
municipal
broadcasting
stations.
for
example,
the
director
of
the
new
york
city
station
said
we
don't
take
any
editorial
positions
because
if
we
did,
they
would
have
to
be
the
positions
of
the
mayor,
and
therefore,
we
take
none.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
399,
to
prevent
the
use
of
these
stations
which
were
intended
to
be
a
community
resource,
to
provide
excellent
broadcasting,
from
being
used
for
narrow
partisan
purposes.
and
it
prevents
them
from
posing
an
inviting
target
for
narrow
partisan
and
ideological
groups.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
it
certainly
would.
editorializing
has
been
defined
to
mean
the
official
expression
of
views
by
management,
and
if
a
public
station
wanted
to
have
their
equivalent
of
eric
sevareid
or
david
brinkley,
i
see
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that
it
would
contribute
equally
to
public
debate.
i
do
think
that
it
lacks
some
of
the
abusive
features
that
official
editorializing
has.
i
would
draw
a
rough
analogy
here
to
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
the
establishment
clause
doesn't
interfere
with
anybody's
practice
of
religion,
but
it
says
that
congress
cannot
proclaim
one
religion
as
the
official
religion,
and
that
is
essentially
what
section
399
does.
it
doesn't
interfere
with
any
expression
of
views,
but
it
just
says
that
a
public
station
using
public
money
cannot
put
its
official
stamp
of
approval
on
any
particular
view
or
candidate.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
i
don't
take
that
position
at
all,
but
they
are--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--congress
in
no
way
wanted
to
prevent
the
lively
discussion
of
public
issues
and
the
expression
of
every
contrasting
viewpoint.
it
just
did
not
want
an
official
expression
of
view
on
behalf
of
station
management.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
of
course,
they
are
subject
to
the
fairness
doctrine
like
all
other
broadcasters.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it's
not,
but
i'm
saying
the
fairness
doctrine
provides
a
protection
against
slanted
broadcasting.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
congress
drew
a
line
where
a
line
could
be
drawn
between
editorializing
and
other
public
affairs
presentations.
and
i
do
think
that
in
the
case
of
editorializing,
there
is
a
special
feature
that
lends
itself
to
abuse
because
public
money
is
being
used
to
stamp
an
official
viewpoint
as
that
of
station
management,
and
i
think
that's
what
congress
intended
to
prevent.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that's
a
fairness
doctrine
question,
and
fairness
doctrine
compliance.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
they
have
to
present
an
adequate
coverage
of
all
issues
of
public
importance
in
a
fair
presentation
of
contrasting
views
on
those
issues.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
is
not
sufficient
protection
in
this
sphere.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
i
have
trouble
with
the
idea
of
balanced
editorializing.
presumably
a
station
cannot
take
a
pro
and
con
position
on
an
issue.
it
has
to...
editorializing
is
necessarily
one-sided,
and
precisely
for
the
reasons
that
appellees
say
it
is
important
for
them
to
editorialize,
the
right
of
a
private
citizen
to
give
a
reply,
which
incidentally
is
not
guaranteed
except
in
narrower
circumstances
under
the
fairness
doctrine,
is
not
a
complete
answer
to
that.
