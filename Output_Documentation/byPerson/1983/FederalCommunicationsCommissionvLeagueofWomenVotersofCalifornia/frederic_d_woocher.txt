mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
statute
that
very
straightforwardly
and
unabashedly
suppresses
speech
of
the
highest
order
in
our
constitutional
framework.
if
this
statute
were
directed
at
the
washington
post
or
presumably
even
at
cbs
tv
instead
of
at
pacifica
foundation,
there
would
be
no
doubt
of
its
unconstitutionality.
indeed,
in
mills
v.
alabama,
this
court
said
with
respect
to
a
similar
ban
on
editorials
that
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
more
obvious
and
flagrant
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
yet
here
the
government
is
saying
that
the
same
ban
on
editorializing
can
constitutionally
be
applied
against
pacifica
and
other
noncommercial
broadcasters.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
as
long
as
there
is
fairness
is
assured,
which
is
assured
by
the
fairness
doctrine,
yes,
that
would
be
no
problem.
in
fact,
it
would
raise
very
substantial
federalism
issues
if
the
federal
government
were
permitted
to
suppress
the
viewpoints
of
the
state
or
local
governmental
entities,
particularly
if
their
speech
was
directed
at
a
federally
related
issue.
now,
in
order
to
justify
this
distinction
between
this
ban
and
those
bans
which
would
not
be
constitutional
if
applied
in
other
contexts,
the
government
jumps
between
two
separate
rationales.
they
rely
upon
the
presence
of
a
government
subsidy,
and
they
also
rely
upon
the
scarcity
rationale
and
the
scarcity
of
broadcast
frequencies.
but
neither
of
these
rationales,
whether
alone
or
in
combination,
can
support
their
result.
for
the
notion
that
the
government
can
use
its
federal
funds
and
its
federal
subsidy
as
a
justification
for
imposing
a
restriction
on
the
use
of
private
funds
has
never
been
accepted
by
this
court.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
well,
there
are
two
things.
one,
if
the
government's
express
purpose
were
to
discourage
editorializing
with
private
funds,
that
would
raise
constitutional
problems,
even
if
they
only
imposed
the
restriction
on
the
use
of
the
federal
funds.
but
moreover,
the
notion
of
segregability--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
believe
the
regan
decision
laid
forth
two
simple
principles:
one,
that
the
government
may
refuse
to
expend
its
funds
on
a
person's
exercise
of
a
constitutional
principle,
but
even
in
that
context,
the
regan
decision
made
clear
that
if
the
government
did
so
with
an
intent
to
suppress
dangerous
views,
that
that
would
raise
constitutional
problems.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
station
is
told
that
it
cannot
express
its
views
on
controversial
issues
of
public
importance.
that's
what
the
statute
requires.
in
consolidated
edison,
for
example,
this
court
held
that
a
restriction
that
imposes
such
a
restraint
on
the
discussion
of
an
entire
topic
is
just
as
constitutionally
infirm
as
one
which
prohibits--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--and
it
is
saying
you
cannot
do
it
even
with
your
own
private
funds.
i
think
that
is
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
twr,
as...
in
that
opinion
there
were
two
principles.
one
is
that
the
government
may
refuse
to
exercise...
may
refuse
to
subsidize
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
the
second
principle
was
the
reaffirmation
of
the
longstanding
prohibition
against
unconstitutional
conditions.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i
think
that
the
government
may
not
suppress
speech
that
is
paid
for
with
private
funds.
now,
the
notion
of
segregability
is
one
that
has
been
consistently
accepted
not
only
by
congress
but
by
this
court's
jurisprudence,
in
the
establishment
clause
area,
for
example.
it
is
accepted
that
the
government
may
spend
money
which
goes
to
a
religious
institution,
and
presumably
that
religious
institution
may
use
that
money
to
free
up
some
other
money
and
therefore
expend
that.
congress
does
it
all
the
time
when
they
impose
categorical
grants.
and
in
fact,
the
government
has
argued
in
the
grove
city
case
that
it
is
appropriate
to
segregate
funds.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
because
in
doing
that
they
have
placed
a
prohibition
on
wholly
private
funds,
and
it
is
not
a
question--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--the
fact
that
the
station
needs
the
money
so
much
just
points
out
what
a
coercive
influence
it
is
on
the
station.
it
is
the
same
as
the
postal
subsidy--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--well,
we
have
a
situation
here--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--even
if
that
were
the
case,
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
the
government
does
not...
the
federal
government
does
not
supply
60
percent
of
the
funding,
for
example.
pacifica
foundation,
my
client,
who
was
prohibited
from
expressing
its
own
views
with
its
own
privately
supported,
privately
raised
funds,
cannot
do
so,
and
it
gets
only
20
percent
of
its
funds
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
well,
because
the
facts
support
it.
the
facts
are
that
the
federal
government
supplies--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
don't
think
that's
a
relevant
consideration,
whether
or
not--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
just
don't
think
that's
a
relevant
consideration,
whether
or
not--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--right,
because
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
many
of
the
newspapers,
many
of
the
magazines
that
receive
postal
subsidies
would
shut
down
without
the
government
money.
many
institutions
in
our
country
would
shut
down
without
government
money.
but
if
the
government
could
apply
the
same
rationale
to
all
those
institutions
that
receive
any
government
funds,
this
would
lead
to
a
terrible
parade
of
horribles.
it
would
allow
them
to
coerce
the
forfeiture
of
their
constitutional
rights
because
the
government
holds
out
the
carrot
of
its
funds
and
says
if
you
want
to
receive
these
funds
which
you
need
to
survive,
which
in
our
society
is
increasingly
the
case,
you
can't
get
them
unless
you
promise
that
you
are
not
going
to
editorialize,
unless
you
promise
you
will
not--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
unless
you
promise
not
to
express
your
own
views.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
well,
certainly
not,
and
that
points
up
the
distinction--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--well,
the
government
may
choose
to
propagate
its
own
views.
it
may
choose
to
buy
air
time
to
propagate
its
views,
for
example.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
because
that
is
a
governmental
entity.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
and
it
is
a
very
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
these
are
not
governmental
entities.
the
noncommercial
broadcaster--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that
is
the
case.
a
welfare
recipient
might
not
be
able
to
exist
without
the
government's
support.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
society
and
a
lot
of
institutions
in
society
that
cannot
exist
without
the
governmental
support.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
it
could
not...
it
might
not
be
a
governmental
entity.
it
would
depend
very
much
on
the
way
it
was
set
up.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
it
would
be
a
100
percent
government
funded
private
entity.
a
welfare
recipient
is
not
a
governmental
entity,
even
though
he
may...
he
or
she
may
receive
all
their
funds
from
the
government,
and
under
the
current
regulatory
structure,
no
noncommercial
station
is
a
federal
governmental
entity.
and
that
is
a
very
important
distinction
because
while
the
government
may
with
certain
limits
impose
restrictions
no
the
use
of
its
funds,
and
the
effect
may
be
that
if
a
station
is
100
percent
government
funded,
the
effect
would
be
to
prohibit
editorializing...
they
cannot
use
the
leverage
of
their
government
funds
to
suppress
speech
to
support
it
wholly
with
private
funds.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i
don't
believe
that
it's
unconstitutional.
i
believe
the
federal
government
probably
has
an
opportunity
to
speak
as
well.
there
are
certain
restrictions,
as
mr.
alito
pointed
out,
that
the
federal
government
should
not
be
allowed
to
drown
out
all
opposing
voices.
but
i
don't
think
the
first
amendment
applies
to
the
federal
government
in
terms
of
restricting
what
it
wants
to
do
in
terms
of
its
own
speech.
but
it
does
restrict
what
a
private
entity
can
do
with
their
speech
and
can
do
with
their
own
private
funded
speech,
and
that
is
the
essence
of
this
case.
now,
the
government--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--no,
there
may
be
limits--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
misstated
it.
there
are
limits
on
what
the
government
might
do,
but
the
first
amendment
applies
in
the
context
of
the
entire
spectrum
of--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
there
may
be
limits
imposed
on
the
governmental
speech
by
the
first
amendment,
but
they
are
certainly
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
of
course
not,
because
the
government
would
be
coercing--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke
myself.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
now,
the
government,
when
confronted
with
the
difficulties
in
their
government
funding
argument
and
the
fact
that
in
fact
it
is
not
simply
a
limitation
placed
on
the
use
of
federal
funds,
but
is
a
limitation
placed
on
the
use
of
wholly
private
funds...
and
i
might
add
that
pacifica
foundation
could
go
out,
solicit
contributions
solely
for
its
editorializing,
and
that
would
be
prohibited
by
this
statute
as
well,
but
then
the
government
shifts
grounds
and
points
to
the
scarcity
rationale
as
a
justification
for
imposing
the
restriction
here
that
they
concede
could
not
be
imposed
on
other
recipients
of
government
funds.
but
the
scarcity
rationale
gets
them
no
further
either.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that
is
the
justification
that
would
be
used--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
correct.
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
thought
until
this
day,
until
mr.
alito
suggested
that
perhaps
you
could
place
similar
restrictions
on
newspapers
to
the
extent
they
were
government
funded,
that
there
was
no
permissible
restriction
like
that.
and
the
only
justification,
therefore,
for
applying
it
to
noncommercial
broadcasters
who
receive
government
funds
and
not
applying
it
to
other
written
press
that
receive
government
funds
must
rest
on
the
scarcity
rationale.
but
the
whole
notion
of
the
scarcity
rationale
is
to
maximize
the
number
and
diversity
of
views
that
are
heard
over
the
airwaves.
that's
why
the
fairness
doctrine
is
a
constitutional
doctrine,
because
it
doesn't
prohibit
the
broadcaster
from
expressing
its
own
views;
it
simply
says
that
if
you
express
your
views,
to
make
sure
that
the
paramount
right
of
the
public
to
hear
a
diverse
number
of
views,
you
have
to
give
an
opportunity
for
the
presentation
of
other
views.
but
this
statute--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--it
does.
the
record
reveals,
i
believe,
that
there
is...
that
pacific
received
approximately
20
1/2
percent,
20.5
percent
of
its
funds
from
federal
sources.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
precise...
that's
exactly
true.
it
was
founded
in
1949.
it
subsisted
for
over
20
years
without
a
penny
of
federal
aid.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
which
shows
that
perhaps
the
federal
aid
is
not
necessary
to
their
survival.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
facts
about
pacifica
are
known.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
not
at
all.
the
only
difference
would
be
that
it
might
be
permissible
to
impose
a
restriction
on
the
80
percent,
but
on
the
20
percent
that
would
be
still
private
funds,
no.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i
suppose
i
would
rather
win
this
case
for
the
client,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
equally
poor
precedent
if
it
were
to
rely
on
the
amount
of
the
federal--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
correct.
i
might
add
that
pacifica
is
by
no
means
a
typical
in
that
regard,
and
there
are
many
stations...
it
is
not
the
case,
as
mr.
alito
said,
that
we
do
not
know
that
there
are
some
noncommercial
broadcasters
that
don't
receive
federal
funds.
there
are
approximately
over
1000
radio
stations
out
there
that
don't
receive
any
funds
from
cpb,
and
many,
many
of
them
don't
receive
any
federal
funds
at
all.
now,
getting--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--it
is
certainly
a
content-based
regulation,
and
i
am
mystified
by
the
government
suggesting
that
it
is
not
content-based.
i
think
what
they
may
be
doing
is
confusing--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
correct.
they
may
be
confusing
the
notion
of
content-related
or
content-based
with
content
neutrality.
all
that
the
nccb
opinion,
for
example,
stated
was
that
was
not
a
content-related
statute
at
all
because
in
that
situation
it
was
merely
a
structural
regulation,
a
precondition
about
newspapers
being
able
to
own
stations,
collocation,
issues
like
that.
in
fact,
the
effect
of
that
restriction
there
was
to
enhance
the
diversity
of
views
that
the
public
would
be
exposed
to.
speiser,
on
the
other
hand,
talked
about
content
neutrality,
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
content
neutral
statute
is
very
different
from
one
that
is
content
based.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
pacifica
does
not
publish
commercial
advertising?
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that
is
correct.
the
only
restriction
that
is
placed
on
the
content
of
the
noncommercial
broadcaster's
programming.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
well,
it's
a
very--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--it
is
a
very
different
sort
of
restriction,
because
as
this
court
has
recognized,
first
of
all,
commercial
speech
has
always
been
entitled
to
less
than
full
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
here
we
have
speech
that
is
being
prohibited
that
is
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
and
second,
the
restriction
on
commercial
advertising
in
fact
does
not
prevent
them
from
expressing
those
views
over
the
air.
the
only
thing
it
prevents
is
them...
prevents
them
from
doing
is
receiving
payment--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
it.
that
is
the
only
other
kind
of
program
restriction,
and
even
that,
as
i
say,
is
not
a
programming
restriction.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
correct.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
what
would
be
imposed
upon
all
broadcasters.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
record
doesn't
show
how
it
would
exercise
that
right.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
record
does
not
show
whether
or
not
it
has
exercised
it
in
the
past,
but
as
i
say,
that
is
really
not
relevant.
the
issue
is
that
this
statute--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--pacifica...
there
is
in
the
record
a
statement
by
pacifica
that
it
fully
intends
to
exercise
its
right
to
editorialize
if
section
399
were
declared
unconstitutional.
that
is
very
clear
in
the
record.
and
i
think--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--it
has
been
prohibited
from
editorializing
up
to
now.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
correct.
it
has
not.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
record
doesn't
reveal
that,
and
i
don't
know.
it
is
at
least
since
1967
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
correct.
it
has
been
under
this--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--financially,
perhaps.
i
don't
think
it
has
been
thriving.
the...
in
fact--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
correct.
it
brought
this
case
because
it
did
not
consider
itself
able
to
provide
the
services
to
its
community
that
it
wished
to
provide,
and
one
of
those
services
was
editorials.
and
i
think
the
question
of
what
type
of
editorial
would
it
be
likely
to
air
is
a
relevant
one.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
it
is
probably
the
case
that
it
doesn't.
but
it
does
know
that
it
wants
to
get
involved
in
public
affairs,
and
it
does
know
that
the
right
to
editorialize
is
a
very
important
privilege
to
the
journalist,
and
it
has
had
a
very
meaningful
effect
throughout
the
course
of
history.
now,
pacifica,
for
example,
may
well
wish
to
air
an
editorial
in
connection
with
a
drug
abuse
program
and
say
they
wanted
to
say
we
do
not
think...
we
think
that
people
should
be
very
careful
about
getting
started
in
drug
abuse,
they
should
be
very
careful
about
taking
one
step
down
that
path,
and
they
have
some
programming
which
this
is
done
in
connection
with,
but
their
editorial
says
we
strongly
urge
our
listeners
not
to
get
involved
in
any
use
of
drugs.
now,
what
conceivable
threat
does
this
pose
to
the
government
in
this
case?
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
at
this
point
i
believe
that's
the
case,
that
the
grants
are
not
restricted.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
right,
but
that
is
very
different
from
pacifica
itself--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that's
correct,
except
for
the
fairness
doctrine
obligations.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
certainly
it
would
be
all
right.
i
don't
believe
the
government
has
any
right
to
prevent
anyone
from
speaking
those
views.
what
the
fairness
doctrine
requires
is
that
there
be
an
opportunity
presented
for
the
expression
of
a
contrary
viewpoint.
now,
the
government--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--or
the
fcc
could
determine
in
its
regulatory
framework,
that
if
that
broadcaster
had
somehow
continually
either
violated
the
fairness
doctrine
or
exposed
this
one
view
and
was
using
its
station
for
those
purposes,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
same
licensing
restrictions
and
same
possibility
of
license
revocation
as
a
commercial
station.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
case,
but
under
their
power
in
granting
licenses.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
correct.
the
money
is
appropriated
by
congress
to
the
corporation
for
public
broadcasting.
at
that
point
the
corporation--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--that
is
a
nonpartisan,
private
entity.
it
is
not
a
governmental
entity.
it
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
its
members
are
appointed
in
a
nonpartisan
fashion
i
believe
by
the
president.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
congress
may
have
a
hand,
but
congress
i
believe
may
have
the
right
of...
yes,
congress
does
have
the
right
of
confirmation.
so
they
are
appointed--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
they
are
a
staggered
term,
that's
correct.
and
there
are
requirements
as
to
the
number
of
each
person's...
it
can
be
any
political
party.
cpb
then
takes
that
money
and
combines
it
with
private
donations
that
they
receive.
for
example,
last
year
they
received
$150
million
from
the--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--well,
there's
a
very
important
difference
between
pbs
and
cpb.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
cpb
has
statutory
structures
as
to
how
much
of
their
money
they
can
allocate.
the
best--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--the
cpb
board.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
no,
no,
no.
as
i
say,
congress
sets
up
structures.
it
is
a
very
much
an
objective,
nondiscretionary
process.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
the
amount
of
money
that
they
get
is
established
in
terms
of
a
proportionate
amount
by
congress.
cpb
then
puts
it
through
an
objective,
nondiscretionary
formula
that
trickles
the
money
out
to
the
stations.
it
is
an
automatic
process.
if
the
station
editorialized,
it
couldn't
possibly
affect
the
amount
of
money
they
got.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
right.
there
are
some
certain
basic
requirements,
the
cpb
eligibility
requirements.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
that's
correct,
by
the
fact
that
you
are
a
nonprofit
organization
of
a
certain
size
with
a
certain
capacity,
certain
power,
in
terms
of--
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
--as
far
as
i
can
tell,
there
is
absolutely
no
chance
of
being
influenced
in
terms
of
any
individual
funding
decisions.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
not
under
the...
there
is
no
way
that
that
could
happen.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
not
to
any
particular
station.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
unfortunately
not.
now,
the
government
has
suggested
that
there
is
something
special
about
an
editorial
which
distinguishes
it
from,
for
example,
the
other
programs
that
they
might
put
out
on
drug
abuse
that
you
were
referring
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
contended
that
it
somehow
lends
itself
especially
to
abuses,
but
the
fcc
rejected
that
argument,
and
for
the
past
40,
35
years,
they
have
in
fact
stated
just
the
opposite
and
have
encouraged
editorializing
because
they
feel,
and
rightly
so,
that
an
editorial
is
the
most
straightforward
and
open
expression
of
a
station's
viewpoint
and
doesn't
lend
itself
to
any
kind
of
abuses
that
might
be
inherent
in
the
programming
aspect
of
it.
so
not
only
do
we
have
a
situation
where
they
are
prohibited
from
expressing
their
views
in
a
straightforward
fashion,
but
that
prohibition
itself
runs
counter
to
the
very
principle
that
the
government
seeks
to
achieve
by
funding
noncommercial
broadcasting
stations.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
if
they
could
find
someone
responsible,
yes.
mr.
frederic
d.
woocher
well,
they
have
to
have
a
responsible
spokesperson
for
that
viewpoint.
i
think
in
conclusion
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
really
does
involve
more
than
just
the
rights
of
pacifica
foundation
and
more
than
just
the
rights
of
noncommercial
broadcasters
because
the
government's
argument
does
extend
well
beyond
the
confines
of
that
context.
indeed,
it
extends
beyond
the
confines
of
commercial
broadcasting.
what
they
are
saying,
the
essence
of
what
they
are
saying
they
can
do
is
prescribe
institutional
neutrality.
they
concede
that
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
they
were
prohibiting
one
view
or
another,
but
they
think
that
they
can
prescribe
institutional
neutrality
on
the
theory
that
expressions
of
the
institution's
viewpoints
are
somehow
incompatible
with
the
intended
mission
in
society
of
that
institution.
i
believe
that
that
truly
has
alarming
implications
in
this
day
and
age
where
it
is
no
longer
the
case
that
the
single
individual's
voice
can
effectively
provide
a
counterweight
to
government
action.
it
is
increasingly
the
case
that
people
have
to
rely
on
groups
of
individuals,
on
institutions,
on
educational
institutions,
on
state
and
local
governments
to
provide
a
voice
in
contrast
to
that
of
the
federal
government,
and
if
the
federal
government
through
the
coercive
use
of
its
funding
which,
as
i
say,
is
more
and
more
pervasive,
can
require
those
institutions
to
give
up
the
right
to
speak,
even
if
it
is
not
directed
at
a
specific
viewpoint,
it
would
mean
that
there
would
be
no
effective
voices
left
to
counteract
the
government's
voice
if
and
when
such
a
counteracting
voice
is
needed.
and
i
believe
that
is
the
true
implications
of
what
is
happening
in
this
case.
thank
you.
