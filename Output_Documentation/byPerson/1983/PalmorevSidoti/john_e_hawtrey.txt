mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
before
we
can
determine
that
there
is
an
impermissible
classification
in
this
particular
case,
there's
at
least
six
questions
that
have
to
be
answered
in
favor
of
the
petitioner's
position...
the
first
one
being,
and
probably
the
most
important...
is
what
relationship
was
before
the
trial
court?
the
second
one
is,
to
what
extent
did
the
state
have
any
interest
in
that
relationship?
the
third,
did
the
trial
court
classify
the
relationship?
the
fourth,
did
the
classification,
if
any,
result
in
some
form
of
action
by
the
state
without
reasonable
relation
to
the
classification?
fifth,
and
alternatively
to
the
last
question,
was
the
classification,
if
any,
suspect
as
the
rules
dealing
with
suspect
classes
tell
us?
and,
if
suspect,
was
there
a
compelling
state
interest
to
classify?
as
i've
indicated,
i
think
that
the
most
important
question
to
determine
whether
this
is
an
impermissible
classification
is
the
first
one:
what
relationship
was
before
the
trial
court?
we
would
suggest
that
the
relationship
before
the
trial
court
was
the
parent-child
relationship;
that
the
parent-new
spouse
relationship
was
collateral,
was
secondary.
the
cases
that
deal
with
the
relationships
in
custody
cases,
in
adoption
cases,
in
the
foster
care
cases,
all
seem
to
indicate
that
the
parent-new
spouse
relationship
is
secondary.
i
think
the
best
one
is
the
situation
that
existed
in
the
smith
v.
the
organization--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--i
believe
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
is
that
it
controlled
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
differ
from
that
opinion.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
was
dealing
with
more
facts
than
merely
the
fact
of
race.
but
he
was
dealing,
was
he
not,
with
the
new
spouse
relationship
as
the
reason
for
changing
custody?
the
mother's
new
relationship
with
the
man
who
moved
into
the
home
and
then
later
married
her.
it
would
be
the
respondent's
position,
your
honor,
that
the
relationship
was
how
the
mother
treated
that
new
relationship
as
regards
to
the
child,
and
not
the
new
relationship
per
se.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
reading
of
that
paragraph
that
counsel
refers
to,
that
there
are
three
parts
to
that
paragraph.
the
first
part
takes
the
new
relationship
out
of
consideration
per
se...
the
relationship
per
se
out
of
consideration.
the
middle
part
deals
with
how
the
mother
reacts
to
that
relationship,
and
the
third
one
is
how
the
mother
reacts
to
the
child,
or
how
the
court
expects
the
mother
to
react,
the
interplay
between
the
mother
and
child
as
it
relates
to
the
new
marriage.
i
think
that's
significant,
in
that
the
court
is
progressing,
if
you
would,
through
the
requirements
of
classification.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
think
it
influenced
his
decision--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--in
part.
it's
a
very
secondary
part,
however.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
the
court...
the
trial
court's
primary,
in
our
opinion,
the
primary
feeling
was
that
the
mother
couldn't
cope
with
the
new
relationship.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
think
that
that
paragraph,
when
read
together
as
a
single
paragraph,
says
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
the
father's
evident
resentment?
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
think
that
the--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--your
honor,
i'm
reading
that
into
that
paragraph
because--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--because
the
court
first
struck
the
respondent...
my
client's
resentment
to
the
mother's
choice.
that's
the
first
sentence.
the
second
sentence--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--precisely,
your
honor.
the
court
was
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
consider
this
on
a
racial
ground,
purely
racial
ground.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
and
the
second--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
don't
think
so.
the
second
and
third
sentences
both
deal
with
the
mother's
conduct
and
the
mother's
ability
to
cope.
the
third
sentence,
or
the
fourth
sentence
is
the
one
that
deals
with
the
future.
but
if
we
relate
it
to
the
first...
one
of
the
first
three
sentences...
we
have
to,
in
my
way
of
thinking,
relate
it
to
the
two
immediately
preceding
sentences,
rather
than
relating
it
back
to
the
first
sentence.
it
doesn't
logically
go
with
the
first
sentence.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
because
i
think
he's
referring
back
to
the
mother's
incapability
of
handling
that.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
don't
think
he...
he
definitely
doesn't
say
it
say
it
specifically.
but
when
he
talks
about...
first
talking
about
the
mother
bringing
the
man
into
the
home,
and
the
business
about
carrying
on
sexual
relationships
with
him,
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
"such
action
tended
to
place
gratification
of
her
own
desires
ahead
of
her
concern
with
her
children's
future
welfare.
"
and
then
the
court
immediately
talks
about
the
child's
future
welfare.
and
it
seems
evident
to
me...
i
wasn't
at
the
trial
court
level,
but
it
seems
to
me,
in
reading
the
decision,
that
when
the
court
talks
about
the
mother's
intending
to
place
her
own
gratification
before
her
child's
future
welfare,
and
then
talks
about
the
future
welfare,
the
court
is
saying,
in
essence,
that
there
is
an
ability
of
the
mother
to
cope,
and
therefore
the
child
will
suffer.
i
think
additionally,
that
the
relationship,
the
parent-spouse
relation...
new
spouse
relationship...
hasn't,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
a
recognized
liberty
interest
or
a
right
in
family
privacy,
both
of
which
are
dealt
with
in
the
cases
dealing
with
classification
of
family
interests.
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
showing
that
there
is
either
a
recognized
liberty
interest
or
a
recognized
right
to
family
privacy.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
that's
correct.
but
the
way
that
i
have
read
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
for
the
mother,
there
lacks
a
distinction
between
due
process
and
equal
protection;
that
the
tendency
is,
is
to
create,
i
think
it's
been
classified
as
a
per
se
impermissible
classification,
which
i
would
classify
in
the
nature
of
a
suspect
class,
rather
than
merely
investigating
whether
or
not
there
was
a
classification.
at
this
point
in
time,
when
i'm
dealing
only
with...
when
i'm
dealing
with
the
relationship
before
the
court,
i'm
trying
to
isolate
that
question.
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
if
we
look
at
a
scales
of
justice
analogy
in
this
particular
case,
and
we
put
the
parent-child
relationship
on
one
side,
we
can
put
either
the
best
interests
doctrine
or
the
material
and
substantial
change
doctrine,
as
it
applies
in
the
florida
law,
on
the
other
scale.
but
if
you
put
the
parent-new
spouse
relationship
in
one
scale,
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
a
showing
at
least
of
what
we're
weighing
that
against,
what
the
trial
court
was
weighing
that
against
on
the
other
side.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
believe
that's
correct.
there's
no
question
that
ongoing
litigation
in
this
area
could
take
place.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
justice
marshall,
i
understand
that
there
was...
that
the
thing
that
she
was
coping
with
was
a
racial
matter.
but
as
regards
to
the
parent-child
relationship,
it
was
her
inability
to
relate
to
her
child,
not
her
inability
to
relate
to
the
marriage.
i
think
that
her
ability
or
inability
to
relate
to
the
marriage
falls
in
the
category
of
the
loving
case.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
don't
think
that
she
can
relate
that
to
her
child.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
saying.
since
i
wasn't
at
the--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--i
think
the
next
step
is
to
look
to
see
if
there
is
either
a
compelling
or
rational
reason
for
the
court's
action,
whether
there
has
been
a
showing
that
there
has
been
an
adverse...
i
think
it's
been
characterized
as
coercion
not
to
marry
or
a
penalty
for
marriage...
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
in
the
trial
court's
decision
or
in
the
record
of
the
state
courts
of
florida
to
show
that.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
if
that's
the
sole
question
before
this
court,
that
the
sole
reason,
that
there
was
no
others,
then
the
trial
court
has
classified
the
mother.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
determining...
yeah.
she's
been
put
into
a
classification.
the
next
question
is
whether
there's
any
showing
in
the
case
or
not,
has
there
been
a
adverse
or
a
state
action
that
does
not
either
have
a
rational
relationship
to
the
classification,
or
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
think
that
the
question
is,
if
we're
going
to
classify,
then
how
are
we
going
to
use
that
classification?
in
an
adoption
suit
or
a
state
custody
suit,
where
it
is
the
state
taking
custody,
or
as
in
the
smith
case
where
we're
dealing
with
foster
families,
i
think
that
there
are...
there
has
been
shown
to
be
reasonable
state
relationships,
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
is
a
compelling
state
interest
that
override
the
classification.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
that
the
state
may
justifiably
classify
that
relationship,
yes.
i
believe
that's
true.
and
i
believe
it
would
apply
to
any
mixed
race
marriage.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i'm
not
sure
of
your
question.
if
the
question
is
do
i
think
that
the
court
changed
the
relationship
merely
because
of
the
interracial
marriage,
and
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
would
not
be
served
but
for
that
decision,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
the
court
can
classify
the
relationship
and
still
consider
the
child.
after
all,
the
court
was...
had
the
opportunity
to
view
the
mother,
to
listen
to
arguments,
to
listen
to
all
the
evidence,
and
to
read
that
in
as
a
adverse
relationship,
that
the
modification
was
an
adverse
relationship,
in
other
words,
it
was
either
coercion
or
a
penalty,
it
isn't
in
the
record
and
it
certainly
isn't
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
hope
i'm
not
supporting
that.
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
is
that
unless
there
is--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--to
answer
your
second
question,
no,
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
cases
support
that.
but
what
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
is
a
showing
that
that
is
a
adverse
effect
on
the
child
or
a
penalty
or
coercion
to
the
mother.
this
is...
we
don't
have
a
case
here
we
have
a
state
action
that's
going
to
throw
the
mother
in
jail
or
fine
her.
we
have
to
read
into--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--we
have
to
read
into
it
that
that
is
a
penalty
or
coercion--
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
--i
think
it's
secondary
to
the
interest
between
the
parent
and
the
child.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
ten
being
the
highest
and
1
being
the
lowest?
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
from
the
standpoint
of
classification
between
the
mother
and
the
child,
i'd
say
5.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
i
would
say
it
was
equal
towards
the
mother...
between
the
child
and
the
mother.
the
extent
of
the
relationship,
when
we
look
at
it
between
the
parent
and
the
child,
and
not
the
parent
and
the
new
spouse,
i
think,
is
the
interest
that
the
state
has.
i
think
that
the
parent
and
the
new
spouse
relationship
was
one
of
either
quality
or
quantity
that
relates
to
the
parent-child
relationship.
we're
only
dealing
with
one-half
of
it.
the
classification,
if
any,
that
we
have
in
the
case
is,
again,
a
classification
of
the
spouse...
new
spouse-parent
relationship...
and
it
would
fall
into
the
same
category,
i
believe,
in
this
type
of
custody
as
a
custody
by
state,
as
in
the
smith
v.
organization
of
foster
families.
i
think
that
it's
the
same
type
of
consideration
as
we
have
in
the
drummond
case,
which
is
an
adoption
case.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
marriage
per
se.
it's
not
a
relationship
like
we
have
in
loving.
the
court
is
not...
the
trial
court
is
not
making
the
same
type
of
presumptions.
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
is
making
the
same
type
of
presumptions
as
in
the
kramer
v.
kramer
case,
which
is
probably
very
close
in
factual,
in
the
factual
basis.
mr.
john
e.
hawtrey
your
honor,
it's
the
case
out
of
iowa
that's
reported
in
297
n.w.
2d
359...
is
the
one
i'm
referring
to.
[laughter]
in
that
case,
i
believe
there
was
an
effort
to
exclude
race
entirely
from
the
case,
but
the
judge
then
inserted
it
in
a
similar
fashion
as
in
this
case.
but
the
court,
in
the
kramer
case,
was
making
presumptions.
i
think
that
the
court,
in
the
kramer
case,
was
making
the
same
kind
of
presumptions
that
we
had
in
the
stanley
v.
illinois
case,
where
we
were
going
to
decide...
where
illinois
decided
that
an
unwed
father
was
presumptively
incapable
of
having
or
fathering
or
being
the
father
of
the
child,
and
that
he
would
have
to
seek
his
child
in
some
other
fashion.
i
think,
in
addition
to
looking
at
what
may
have
been
a
classification,
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
the
action
taken
by
the
state
court.
the
action
taken
by
the
state
court
was
a
modification.
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
we
can
go
back
in
and
review
this
again
and
again,
i
guess
from
the
time
the
child
is
age
six
till
the
child
is
age
18,
but
unless
there
is
a
showing,
and
i
don't
believe
at
this
point
in
time
that
there's
been
a
showing
of
either
coercion
or
penalty,
that
the
state
action
taken
necessarily
is
anything
other
than
what
is
permissible
under
the
state
law.
the
arlington
heights
v.
metropolitan
housing
case
indicates
to
us
that
if
we're...
if
we're
going
to
have
an
allegation
of
racial
discrimination,
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
intent
and
purpose
in
the
racial
discrimination
or
classification
that
i
don't
believe
has
been
shown
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
one
of
the
elements
necessary
to
show
an
impermissible
classification
lacks
in
that
instance.
the
other
alternative
view
could
be
that
the
classification
is
suspect,
but
all
of
the
custody
cases
seem
to
take
that
type
of
classification
or
racial
classification
out
of
the
suspect
nature
and
place
them
in
a
framework
of
rational
relationship
between
the
classification
authorities.
finally,
again
looking
at
the
kramer
case
and
quoting
from
it:
"it
is
best
said,
just
as
no
assumptions
are
automatically
warranted
based
on
gender
of
parent
or
child,
we
believe
no
assumptions
are
automatically
warranted
by
racial
identify.
"

i
