mr.

if
we're
going
to
parse
this
thing,
in
view
of
the
opening
clause
of
the
fourth
sentence,
i
would
think
your
argument
is
rather
difficult
to
sustain.
if
this
is
the...
is
it
the
fourth
sentence
that
begins
the
fourth
line
from
the
bottom
of
page
26?
"this
court
feels
that,
despite
the
strides
that
have
been
made
in
bettering
relations
between
the
races
in
this
country,
it
is
inevitable
that
melanie
will,
if
allowed
to
remain
in
her
present
situation
and
attain
school
age,
and
thus
more
vulnerable
to
peer
pressure,
suffer
from
the
social
stigmatization
that
is
sure
to
come.
"
now,
if
the
circuit
judge
was
talking
about
the
things
mentioned
in
sentences
one,
two,
and
three,
rather
than
the
race
business
in
sentence
one,
why
would
he
begin
the
fourth
sentence
with
about
"despite
the
strides
that
have
been
made
in
bettering
relations
between
the
races?
