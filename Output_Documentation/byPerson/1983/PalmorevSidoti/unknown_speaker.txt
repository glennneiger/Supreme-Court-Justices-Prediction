unknown
speaker
is
it
your
contention
that
that's
the
only
ground
on
which
the
judgment
is
based?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
your
client
regains
custody,
mr.
palmore
may
seek
to
adopt,
might
he
not?
then
you
would
have
the
problems
that
justice
o'connor
has
suggested.
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
other
children,
incidentally?
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmore.
unknown
speaker
by
a
prior
marriage?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
would
you
mind
telling
me
where...
we're
looking
at
paragraph
5
of
page
26.
is
that
what
you
have
reference
to?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
is
it...
the
paragraph
there
is
the
interpretation
that
you
just
suggested?
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
that
he
was
concerned
that
the
mother
could
not
cope
with
the
new
relationship.
where
does
that
appear?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
where
are
you
reading
it
in?
unknown
speaker
the
first
simply
says
that
his
resentment
of
the
mother's
choice
is
not
sufficient
to
rest
custody.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
goes
on
to
consider
it
on
purely
racial
grounds.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
then
the
judge
goes
on
to
consider
it
on
purely
racial
grounds.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
where,
specifically,
does
he
speak
to
the
mother's
incapability?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
don't
need
a
recognized
liberty
interest
if
your
claim
is
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
rather
than
the
due
process
clause,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
if
you
suggest
that
this
judgment
really
didn't
substantially
rest
on
a
racial
consideration,
you
must
inevitably
claim
that
there
were
nonracial
grounds
for
the
action.
and
if
that's
the
case,
you
should
be
able
to
win
another
custody
case
where
it's
made
perfectly
clear
that
there's
no
racial
factor
be
involved.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
suggests
that
there
could
be
another
custody
case
here.
and
you
seem
to
think
there
are
ample
nonracial
grounds
for
leaving
custody
where
it
is
now.
unknown
speaker
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
as
to
the
reading
of
the
judge's
remarks,
and
if
there
is
really
a
racial
slur,
as
your
colleague
says,
in
the
case...
let's
just
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
and
say,
counsel,
we
just
disagree
with
that
reading.
now...
and
just
assume
that
we're
right
in
reading
the
judge's
remarks
that
way.
what
would
be
your
suggestion
to
us
as
to
what
we
ought
to
do?
unknown
speaker
no.
if
we
read
what
the
judge
said
as
saying
the
mother
loses
custody
here
because
she
married
a
black
man...
suppose
we
just
read
it
that
way.
what
should
we
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
has
made
a
racial...
has
used
a
racial
reason,
anyway,
for
determining
the
case.
unknown
speaker
would
you
apply
the
arguments
you're
advancing
to
every
interracial
marriage,
without
respect
to
what
races
were
involved?
suppose,
to
take
an
extreme,
you
had
american
citizens,
one
of
china
mainland,
and
one
of...
or
taiwan...
and
an
american,
or
korean,
or
vietnam,
or
thailand,
whatever.
would
you
advance
these
same
arguments?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
your
argument,
when
it's
boiled
down,
really
almost
this:
that
assuming,
accepting
the
idea
that
this
is
a
racially-based
decision,
it
is...
it
should
be
approved
because
of
the
interests
of
the
child
in
the
present
attitudes
that
you
suggest
in
your
brief
exist
about
these
problems?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
the
court
in
this
case
thought
so,
too?
unknown
speaker
no.
all
you're
going
to
do
is
take
her
child
away.
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
substantial
point,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
kramer
against
kramer
was
a
movie,
wasn't
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
have
you
cited
the
kramer
case
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
what's
its
citation
again?
unknown
speaker
iowa
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
not
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
not
the
court
of
appeals,
the
intermediate
court
in
iowa.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know.
