mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
a
court
from
considering
or
from
relying
upon
a
subsequent
interracial
marriage
of
the
custodial
parent
as
a
ground
for
ordering
a
change
of
custody.
now,
if
i
may,
the
facts
are
straightforward
in
this
case,
and
i
would
like
to
go
through
them
very
quickly
and
get
right
to
the
argument.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
in
this
case,
absolutely.
and
i'd
like
to
explain
how
that
occurred.
we
had
a
final
judgment
of
dissolution
of
marriage
in
this
case
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
both
of
whom
are
white.
the
custody
of
their
three-year-old
daughter
was
awarded
to
the
petitioner,
the
mother
here.
subsequently,
the
husband...
the
father,
i'm
sorry...
filed
a
petition
for
modification.
he
alleged
in
his
petition
that
the
mother
was
living
with
a
black
man
who
she
later
married,
that
the
child
had
two
bouts
of
head
lice,
and
that
the
child
had
been
seen
wearing
a
mildewed
dress.
now,
at
the
hearing
on
this
matter,
the
final
hearing,
the
parties
and
their
new
spouses
testified,
and
the
report
of
the
circuit
court
counsel
was
accepted.
the
order
which
the
circuit
court
entered
on
march
1,
1982
changed
custody
and
awarded
it
to
the
father.
there
were
no
findings
made
regarding
the
father's
secondary
allegations...
and
it
was
called
"secondary
allegations"
by
the
trial
judge...
of
the
mildewed
dress
or
the
head
lice.
the
court
noted
that
she
had
lived
with
man
before
marrying
him.
but
the
court
also
held
that
each
of
the
parents,
the
father
and
the
mother
here,
were
devoted
parents
and
that
each
had
remarried
respectable
spouses.
and
then
in
the
important
phrase
in
this
case,
the
court
stated:
"this
court
feels
that,
despite
the
strides
that
have
been
made
in
bettering
relations
between
the
races
in
this
country,
it
is
inevitable
that
melanie
will,
if
allowed
to
remain
in
her
present
situation
and
attain
school
age
and,
thus,
more
vulnerable
to
peer
pressures,
suffer
from
the
social
stigmatization
that
is
sure
to
come.
"
now,
it's
important
to
note
that
this
is
not
a
neglect
case.
there
was
no
finding
of
neglect,
contrary
to
respondent's
arguments
in
his
brief.
there
was
no
finding
about
lack
of
health
care,
lack
of
hygiene,
lack
of
clothing
or
any
type
of
neglect,
and
certainly
no
finding
of
any
inability
to
cope
on
the
part
of
the
mother.
it's
important
to
remember
that
in
florida,
once
a
custody
decree
has
been
entered,
the
noncustodial
parent
has
an
extraordinary
burden
in
order
to
change
that.
that
person
must,
by
competent
substantial
evidence,
show
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
change
in
circumstances,
and,
no.
2,
that
there
have
been
adverse
effects
on
the
child.
and
this
is
because
the
focus
is
the
best
interest
of
the
children,
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
and
if
it
cannot
be
shown
that
there
was
a
substantial
change
in
circumstances
and
an
adverse
effect
on
the
child,
then
it
has
not
been
shown
that
the
original
determination
as
to
what
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
should
be
disturbed.
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
custody
determinations
are
not
res
judicata,
but
they
must
be
given
some
measure
of
finality.
otherwise,
people
would
be
changing
custody
on
a
regular
basis.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
the
child
is
six
years
old
today.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
yes,
ma'am.
living
with
the
natural
father
in
texas,
where
he
moved
immediately
after
the
custody
determination
was
made
in
march
of
'82.
now,
our
position
is,
and
i
believe
that
it's
clear
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
in
the
order,
that
the
order
was
tainted
with
race,
racial
consideration,
which
renders
it
presumptively
invalid.
no
other
case
so
clearly
rests
a
custody
determination
on
racial
considerations,
at
least
that
i
can
find
in
my
search
of
cases.
the
child
court
took
the
remarriage
of
the
mother
into
consideration
solely
because
her
new
husband
was
black.
he
did
not
consider
the
impact
of
the
father's
remarriage
because
his
new
wife
was
white.
bear
in
mind
that
this
was
foreshadowed
by
the
fact
that
the
court
ordered
a
social
investigation
only
of
the
mother,
despite
the
fact
that
a
motion
for
social
investigation
requested
a
social
investigation
of
both
parties.
having
taken
consideration
of
the
remarriage,
he,
then,
assumed
that
certain
consequences
would
occur
as
a
result
of
the
interracial
marriage.
and
by
this,
i
mean
that
the
child
would
suffer
social
stigmatization
as
a
result
of
the
interracial
marriage.
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence,
nor
is
there
a
finding
of
fact
that
there
is
any
adverse
effect
as
a
result
of
this
interracial
marriage.
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
embodies
the
belief
that
all
persons
are
created
equal.
racial
hatred
and
prejudice
have
no
place
in
our
system
of
law,
but
when
this
trial
court
held
that
melanie,
the
child,
would
suffer
social
stigmatization
as
a
result
of
the
interracial
marriage,
he
gave
the
racial
bias
of
few
the
force
of
law.
now,
it's
clear
from
this
court's
cases,
such
as
cooper
v.
aaron,
shelley
v.
kraemer,
watson
v.
city
of
memphis,
that
a
court
cannot
bow
to
pressure,
public
pressure
to
protect
potential
victims
of
race
discrimination
from
prejudice;
that
the
desire
to
protect
a
person
from
racial
prejudice
does
not
justify
departing
from
the
fundamental
command
of
the
constitution
that
there
be
equal
justice
under
law.
and
the
concept
of
equal
justice
under
law
is
so
central
to
this
country
that
it
is
engraved,
carved
into
the
stone
of
this
building.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
of
course,
as
you
know,
your
honor,
the
question
of
adoption
is
much
different
than
we
have
here
because--
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
all
right.
my
position
is
that
with...
and
i
think
the
courts
have
said
this...
that
the
concept
of
adoption
is
different,
because
the
state
is
conferring
a
right
upon
a
person
who
is
not
a
biological
parent
and,
therefore,
as
long
as
there
is
no
racial
slur
involved
in
taking
that
into
consideration,
that
it
may...
and
as
long
as
this
is
not
automatic,
as
it
was
here,
consideration
of
race...
that
it
may
take
race
into
consideration.
and
this
was
in
the
drummond
case,
which
was
the
fifth
circuit
case,
which
made
reference
to
this
court's
case
in
smith
v.
foster
family
case,
o-f-f-e-r.
and
there's
a
very,
very
big
distinction
between
the
biological
relationship
and
the
state-conferred
relationship.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
well,
but
the
problem
there
is,
there
would
be,
then,
a
conflict
between
the
two
biological
parents.
and
he
is
free
to
petition
for
modification
again
in
the
state
courts
at
the
conclusion
of
this
proceeding,
but
we
ask
that
the
slate
be
wiped
clean.
that's
what
we're
asking
for.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
who
are
we
talking
about:
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
--yes,
he
does.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
i
don't
think
it
was
a
marriage.
i'm
not
absolutely
certain.
i
know
that
he
does
have
another
biological
child
of
his.
but
i
can
say
that
whatever
is
in
this
trial
court's
order
determined
this
custody
determination.
and
he
found
the
man
to
be
respectable,
as
was
the
spouse,
the
new
spouse
of
the
father.
there's
no
question,
he
says
in
the
first
paragraph,
about
the
respectability
of
these
new
spouses.
now,
the
other
major
point
in
this
case,
aside
from
importing
racial
prejudice
of
society
into
the
order
of
a
court,
is
the
aspect
that
the
mother
was
being
punished
for
having
exercised
her
right
to
marry
a
person,
without
regard
to
race.
in
loving
v.
virginia,
this
court
stated
that
a
statute
which
provided
imprisonment
for
interracial
marriage
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
that
case,
the
interracial
remarriage
itself
triggered
the
penalty
of
imprisonment.
in
this
case,
the
interracial
marriage
itself
triggered
the
forfeiture
of
the
child,
with
no
facts
to
justify
the
penalty.
the
respondent
misconstrues
the
loving
case
by
suggesting
that
the
mother
here
is...
cannot
invoke
the
equal
protection
clause
because
she
is
not
black.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
loving
makes
it
very
clear
that
either
party
of
an
interracial
marriage
can
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
the
marriage
is
being
infringed
upon.
now,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
substitute
its
discretion
for
the
trial
court
regarding
any
fitness
determination
or
any
determination
of
the
like.
the
trial
court
has
already
made
these
findings
regarding
the
fitness
of
the
parties.
there
is
no
doubt
about
this.
we
seek
a
ruling
that
the
circuit
court's
order
applied
an
unconstitutional
rule
of
law
by
relying
on
the
fact
of
the
interracial
marriage
and
by
allowing
the
existence
of
racial
prejudice
in
society
to
dictate
the
nature
of
this
custody
proceeding
and
the
order
it
produced.
we're
not
asking
for
a
ruling
that
the
mother
should
be
the
custodial
parent
for
all
time.
this
we
cannot
have,
because
of
what
i
indicated
earlier
about
the
fact
that
custody
determinations
are
not
res
judicata.
but
again,
we
ask
that
the
slate
be
wiped
clean,
and
again
the
father
is
entitled
to
file
another
petition
for
modification
if
he
so
desires,
but
one
which
does
not
contain
racial
grounds,
and
contains
other
legitimate
grounds
for
change
of
custody,
if
he
so
desires.
therefore,
we
seek
an
order
revising
and
vacating
this
case,
with
instructions
to
the
second
district
court
of
appeal
to
set
aside
the
trial
court's
order
on
modification,
thus
restoring
the
parties
to
their
original
status
under
the
original
dissolution
of
marriage
final
judgment.
i
have
some
more
time,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
unless
you
have
some
questions
of
me
right
now.
mr.
robert
j.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
has
another
question
from
me,
i
don't
have
any
further
comments.
