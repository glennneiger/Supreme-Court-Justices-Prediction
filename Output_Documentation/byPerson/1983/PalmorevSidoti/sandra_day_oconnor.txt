how
old
is
the
child
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
presently
living
with
the
natural
father?
justice

mr.
shapiro,
do
you
think
that
a
state
could,
in
placing
a
child
for
adoption,
consider
the
biological
characteristics
of
the
adoptive
parents
in
an
effort
to
place
the
child
in
a
family
with
similar
characteristics
of
the
baby
or
child
being
placed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
hawtrey,
i
don't
think
i
understand
yet.
if
all
that
we
had
was
a
finding
by
the
court
of
the
interracial
marriage,
and
that
alone
was
the
basis
for
changing
custody,
do
you
support
that
and
think
that
any
of
our
cases
would
permit
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounded
like
you
were.
and
do
you
think
any
of
our
cases
permit
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
not
as
important,
is
it?
taking
the
child
away
from
the
mother?
are
you
suggesting
that's
not
an
important
interest?
