may
i
just
ask,
mr.
hawtrey,
if
the
parent-new
spouse
relationship
is
secondary,
as
you
argue,
it
nevertheless
was
what
controlled
the
decision
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
what
the
trial
judge
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
say
i'm
puzzled.
i
thought
your
brief
had,
in
essence,
assumed
that
that
was
what
caused
the
change
of
custody,
the
new
marriage.
but
you
now
seem
to
be
saying
that,
really,
there
are
other
factors
involved.
and
i
had
read
the
sentence
that
your
opponent
read,
"the
court
feels
about
the
strides
in
race
relations.
"
and
the
like,
as
indicating
that
the
judge
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
the
child
would
be
living
in
a
home
with
a
mixed
marriage,
an
interracial
marriage.
you
don't
think
that
influenced
his
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
isn't
it...
don't
we
have
the
question
whether
it
is
a
proper
factor
for
him
to
have
considered?
isn't
that
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
primary
part?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
he
said
that
in
his
opinion?
