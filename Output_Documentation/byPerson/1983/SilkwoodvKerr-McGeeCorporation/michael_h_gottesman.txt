mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
tort
action
arising
under
state
law.
it
was
in
the
federal
court
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
occasion
for
this
tort
action
is
that
plutonium
escaped
from
a
manufacturing
plant
of
the
defendant
and
that
plutonium
contaminated
karen
silkwood
and
her
apartment.
and
the
complaint
in
this
action,
resembling
complaints
that
have
been
filed,
i
suppose,
for
time
immemorial
in
the
courts
of
this...
of
the
states
of
this
nation,
sought
compensatory
damages
for
both
the
injury
to
person
and
to
property
and
punitive
damages
for
this
state
law
tort.
the
jury
awarded
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
below,
affirmed
in
part
the
compensatory
damage
award
and
reversed
it
in
part.
for
all
purposes
here
that...
the
rulings
on
the
compensatory
damages
are
not
important
except
that
the
court
rejected
an
argument
of
the
defendant
that
compensatory
damages
were
preempted
by
the
atomic
energy
act,
and
in
fact
held
that
compensatory
damages
could
be
awarded,
and
in
fact
affirmed
an
award
of
compensatory
damages
for
property
damage.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
the
only
award
that
remains
in
the
case.
there
is
a
debate
between
the--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
at
the
present...
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
the
punitive
damage
award,
if
it
were
not
preempted,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
address,
number
one,
whether
that
size
award
can
properly
be
predicated
on
the
property
damage
award;
and
number
two,
if
not,
whether
there
should
be
a
remittitur
or
whether
there
should
be
a
retrial
on
the
amount
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
none,
your
honor.
the
courts
have
squarely
held
that
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded
for
property
damage
alone,
or
for
personal
injury
alone,
or
for
both.
the
standards
are
identical
in
both
cases.
and
the
measure
of
punitive
damages
in
oklahoma
relates
to
the
gravity
of
the
harm
threatened
by
the
defendant's
reckless
or
malicious
conduct.
so
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
oklahoma
decisions
which
have
set
aside
in
part
a
compensatory
damage
award
and
yet
still
affirmed
in
full
the
punitive
damage
award.
but
in
any
event,
that
issue
is
not
here.
that
issue
is
the
next
one
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
address
once
it's
established
that
punitive
damages
are
not
preempted.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
issue
would
be
before
the
tenth
circuit.
there
is
a
question
whether
kerr-mcgee
has
waived
the
right
to
make
that
claim
because
it
didn't
advance
it,
but
certainly
the
question
of
whether
it
has
been
waived
or
not,
and
if
not,
the
question
of
whether
the
award
will
sustain
the
punitive
damage
award
are
both
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
decide.
but,
of
course,
the
tenth
circuit
never
got
to
those
questions
because
it
ruled
that
punitive
damages
are
absolutely
preempted
by
the
atomic
energy
act
in
any
suit
against
a
nuclear
operator
relating
to
exposure
to
radiation.
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
issue
that
has
been
brought
to
this
court
by
us,
and
there
is
a
question
at
the
threshold.
the
issue
was
brought
to
this
court
on
an
appeal
alleging
that
the
tenth
circuit
by
ruling
as
it
did
had
held
invalid
the
oklahoma
punitive
damage
statute.
this
court
has
postponed
the
determination
of
jurisdiction,
and
i
do
want
to
spent
just
a
moment
explaining
why
we
think
that
this
in
fact
is
a
proper
appeal
under
1254.2.
in
oklahoma
punitive
damages
exist
only
by
statute.
there
has
been
a
punitive
damage
statute
since
the
first
territorial
legislature
of
the
state.
there
has
never
been
a
common
law
of
punitive
damages.
and
that
punitive
damage
statute
makes
punitive
damages
available,
if,
of
course,
the
culpable
conduct
is
present,
in
any
action
except
a
contract
action.
and
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
has
read
those
words
literally
and
in
authoritative
decisions
has
said
that
except
for
contract
actions,
punitive
damages
are
available
in
any
action.
we
will
not
entertain
arguments
as
to
whether
it's
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea.
this
is
the
legislative
policy
of
this
state.
now,
because
that
is
the
law
of
oklahoma,
the
district
court,
upon
finding
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
a
verdict,
was
required
to
submit
the
punitive
damage
issue
to
the
jury
and
said
that
it
was
required
to
do
so.
it
submitted
it
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
and
the
jury
found
a
violation
in
reliance
on
that
charge.
both
parties
told
the
court
of
appeals
that
punitive
damages
in
oklahoma
are
governed
exclusively
by
this
statute.
and
the
court
below,
given
those
arguments
and
given
an
argument
by
kerr-mcgee
that
there
was
preemption,
began
its
conclusive
paragraph,
the
paragraph
where
it
found
preemption,
saying,
"arguably,
there
should
be
a
strong
presumption
against
preemption
of
state
laws
affecting
such
vital
interests
of
its
citizens
as
those
involved
here.
"
now,
in
oklahoma
the
only
state
law
that
the
court
could
have
been
referring
to
was
23
oklahoma
statute
section
9.
and
though
the
court
did
not
cite
that
section
by
name,
having
begun
that
conclusive
paragraph
saying
"arguably,
there
are
strong
arguments
against
preemption
of
state
laws,
but
nevertheless,
we
find
preemption.
"
we
submit
that
the
court
has
held
invalid
section
9
as
applied
to
nuclear
operators
in
radiation
cases
in
the
full
substance
and
import
of
its
opinion.
we
think,
indeed,
that's
what
it
said,
but
whether
it
said
it
or
not,
that
is
certainly
the
effect
of
what
it
did.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges,
appellate
jurisdiction
exists
if
the
invalidity
of
the
state
statute
was
a
necessary
predicate
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
we
think
it
was.
now,
turning
to
the
issue
on
the
merits,
the
preemption
issue,
we're
dealing
here
with
a
state's
right
to
punish,
to
punish
conduct
that
injures
people
and
that
injures
people
and
is
accompanied
by
a
particularly
reprehensible
state
of
mind...
either
the
deliberate
infliction
of
injury
or
the
infliction
of
injury
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
safety
of
the
state's
citizens.
now,
this
kind
of
punishment,
this
civil
punishment,
if
you
will,
punitive
damages,
has
been
a
traditional
element
of
the
tort
law
in
46
states
of
this
country
and
is
still
in
the
tort
law
of
46
states.
and
what
it
is
designed
to
do
lies
at
the
core
of
the
state's
interest,
that
the
police
power
is
designed
to
protect
people
against
reprehensible
conduct,
very
much
as
the
criminal
law
is.
and
the
question
we
have
here
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
the
atomic
energy
act
intended
to
deprive
the
states
of
this
traditional
piece
of
a
tort
action.
this
is
not
a
separate
action.
it
is
a
remedy
available
in
the
traditional
tort
action.
and,
of
course,
the
answer
is
wholly
one
of
congressional
intent.
we
approach
that
question
with
certain
assumptions
that
this
court
has
stated
are
always
the
starting
point
for
analysis.
first,
an
attempt
to
preempt
a
traditional
state
right
is
never
lightly
presumed.
that
is
especially
so
when
the
state
right
is
exercised
in
the
form
of
tort
actions.
this
court
has
said
that.
and
it
is,
we
would
suggest,
uniquely
so
in
this
case.
never
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
nation,
not
in
this
court,
not
in
any
other
court,
has
there
ever
before
been
a
holding
that
congress
left
compensatory
damages
unpreemptive
and
yet
preempted
the
punitive
damages
in
that
very
same
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
they
serve
a
different
purpose,
but
the
reason
that
you
don't
find
that
kind
of
selective
preemption
is
that
the
purpose
that
they
serve,
punitive
damages,
lie
absolutely
at
the
core
of
the
state's
interest
and
much
more
at
the
periphery
of
the
federal
interest.
so
that
as
i'll
indicate,
as
we
do
in
our
brief...
and
if
we
have
time,
i'll
get
to...
it
would
be
much
less
likely
that
congress
would
make
a
judgment
to
preempt
punitive
damages
than
compensatory.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
it's
not
likely
they
would
choose
to
select
between
them,
and
indeed,
there's
never
been
a
ruling
by
this
court
that
found
one
and
not
the
other.
congress
either
leaves
tort
actions
alone
or
it
doesn't.
and
indeed,
the
burden
of
what
i'm
about
to
come
to
is
that
congress
has
made
rather
remarkably
clear
here
an
intention
to
leave
state
tort
actions
alone,
one
that
encompasses.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think
logically,
justice
o'connor,
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
are
regulatory,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
so
said.
both
have
regulatory
effects.
both
have
regulatory
purposes.
for
example,
the
state
court,
by
determining
what
is
the
standard
of
care
that
it
will
hold
kerr-mcgee
to
and
hold
it
responsible,
therefore,
for
compensatory
damages,
regulates.
if
it
says
the
standard
of
care
is
simple,
reasonable
care,
it
imposes
one
burden
on
kerr-mcgee.
if
it
says
the
standard
is
absolute,
strict
liability,
it
holds
kerr-mcgee
to
a
much
stricter
standard
of
performance.
so
that
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
are
regulatory;
they
regulate
different
things.
compensatory
damages
regulate
what
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
regulates:
the
standard
of
care
with
which
you
operate
your
plant.
punitive
damages
regulate
something
that
the
nrc
does
not
regulate:
your
state
of
mind
in
the
operation
of
that
plant,
whether
you
are
the
kind
of
person
who
behaves
with
a
reprehensible
state
of
mind.
now--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
there
are
some
differences
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
necessarily
have
to.
i
think
the
answer
would
be
the
same.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
this
plant
was
not
covered
by
the
price-anderson
act.
as
to
this
plant
congress
made
the
judgment
we
have
no
interest
in
impeding
the
operation
of
state
tort
law
at
all,
as
contrasted
with
a
nuclear
power
plant
where
congress
has
made
certain
selective
judgments
to
override
the
state
tort
law.
now,
it's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--oh,
absolutely
not.
i
would
assume
that,
assuming
states
can
otherwise
prosecute
terrorists
criminally
for
invading
any
other
plant,
they
could
likewise
prosecute
them
for
invading
a
nuclear
power
plant.
i
shouldn't
think
that
there
would
be
a
question
about
that.
indeed,
i
think
even
the
solicitor
general's
brief
concedes
you
can
prosecute
everybody
but
the
corporation
itself.
now,
however
we
might
derive
answers
to
this
logically,
the
fact
is
that
the
determinative
question
here
is
what
congress
intended
and
what
logic
congress
was
applying.
and
we
have
the
benefit
here
of
a
much
more
extensive
insight
into
congress'
views
about
preemption
than
we
ordinarily
have
in
a
preemption
case,
because
congress
spoke
a
lot
more
about
this.
to
be
sure,
as
this
court
held
last
term
in
pacific
gas
and
electric,
congress
in
enacting
the
1954
atomic
energy
act
and
opening
up
this
industry
to
the
private
sector
reserved
to
federal
exclusive
control
regulation,
at
least
in
the
strictest
sense:
licensing,
inspections,
that
sort
of
thing.
there's
no
question
that
congress
occupied
that
field.
and,
indeed,
those
on
the
other
side
of
this
case
embrace
the
statement
that
this
court
made
in
pg&e
that
congress
has
occupied
the
field
of
regulation,
and
seek
to
evolve
their
entire
solution
out
of
that
sentence
of
the
opinion.
but
it
can't
be
done,
because
were
that
proposition
right,
it
would
follow
that
congress
had
preempted
compensatory
damage
remedies
as
well,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
are
regulatory.
and
yet,
everybody
understands,
and
this
court
has
said
in
duke
power
and
pg&e,
that
when
congress
enacted
the
1954
act,
it
did
not
preempt
the
state's
existing
rights
to
entertain
tort
actions
by
those
who
were
the
victims
of
radiation
injuries.
and,
indeed,
it's
precisely
because
the
'54
act
did
not
preempt
those
tort
actions
that
we
got
the
price-anderson
act,
because
people
said
we're
not
going
to
enter
this
field;
we
are
afraid
of
our
potential
tort
liability.
and
so
congress
addressed
that
question
of
tort
liability
in
the
price-anderson
act.
now,
congress
in
that
act
did
not
cede
to
the
states
the
right
to
entertain
tort
actions.
that's
what
our
adversaries
here
say.
they
say
congress
ceded
to
the
states
the
right
to
have
tort
actions.
that's
not
what
price-anderson
did.
congress
said
the
states
have
these
tort
actions.
they
have
them
already.
the
question
here
is
whether
we
should
put
any
limitations
on
them.
and
in
that
context
congress
spoke
at
length
about
its
view
about
the
state
tort
action.
we
have
a
window
to
congressional
understanding
here
that
is
quite
unique,
and
i
want
to
refer
just
to
a
few
of
the
statements,
and
to
read
them
very
briefly,
that
congress
made
expressing
its
views.
the
other
side
says
well,
never
mind
what
congress
said
here:
they
really
only
meant
compensatory
damages.
but
that
wasn't
the
congressional
mind-set.
for
example,
the
joint
committee
report
in
1956...
and
this
is
when
the
only
interference
with
state
tort
law
that
congress
made
was
to
put
a
$560
million
limit
of
liability
for
certain
operators,
not
for
kerr-mcgee.
the
joint
committee
report
stated
the
two
basic
principles
underlying
the
bill,
and
the
first
of
those
was,
"since
the
rights
of
third
parties
who
are
injured
are
established
by
state
law,
there
is
no
interference
with
the
state
law
except
for
the
$560
million
limit
of
liability.
"
senator
pastore,
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
joint
committee
when
the
'66...
or
the
floor
manager,
i'm
sorry...
when
the
'66
amendments
were
made
said,
"this
bill
follows
the
approach
of
the
original
price-anderson
act;
that
is,
making
a
minimum
interference
with
the
laws
of
the
several
states
insofar
as
legal
liability
for
nuclear
incidents
is
concerned.
"
"our
committee
continues
to
endorse
this
general
approach.
"
finally,
the
joint
committee
in
1966:
"the
bill
has
been
drafted
so
that
minor
claims
involving
nuclear
facilities
or
materials.
"
--and
what
we
have
here
is
a
minor
claim...
"may
remain
subject
to
the
traditional
rules
of
tort
law.
"
now,
there
are
no
qualifications,
and
this
isn't
a
semantic
thing.
congress
had
a
mind-set,
and
it
approached
this
problem
with
several
concerns.
the
first
of
those
concerns
was
that
congress
or
the
sponsors
of
price-anderson
felt
that
if
they
tried
to
overly
interfere
with
state
tort,
well,
they
couldn't
get
a
bill
through
congress.
and
so
there
are
a
number
of
statements
quoted
in
our
brief
of
the
principal
sponsors
of
this
legislation
saying
we
are
going
to
proceed
by
selective
limitation
on
the
state
tort
law.
we
will
identify
with
precision
what
it
is
about
state
tort
law
that
we
think
we
need
to
modify,
because
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
a
bill
through
congress.
if
we
try
to
reach
out
in
an
overly
broad
way
in
a
field
that
is
so
sensitively
one
of
state's
rights,
we're
not
going
to
get
this
bill
through.
so
that
was
number
one.
number
two,
they
thought
this
to
be
an
area
that
was
big
and
mysterious
and
had
lots
of
elements,
and
it
was
different
in
every
state.
and
they
said
there's...
the
chairman
of
the
joint
committee
said
there's
a
jungle
of
50
states'
tort
laws
out
there.
we
don't
know
where
to
begin
to
tackle
those,
and
we
don't
want
to.
we
are
simply
going
to
identify
what
the
problems
are
that
we
think
we
need
to
address
and
address
them
explicitly.
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
congress
said
that
except
for
extraordinary
nuclear
occurrences...
the
meltdown
of
a
power
plant...
there
is
no
reason
why
a
nuclear
plant
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
any
other
business
entity
in
this
country
in
terms
of
its
amenability
to
the
tort
law.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
would
think
that
it
would
like
for
damages...
if
we're
talking
about
radiation
emissions,
then
i
would
think
that
the
message
of
this...
it
isn't
a
necessary
message,
because
that's
not
what
congress
was
thinking
about
when
they
made
these
statements;
what
they
were
thinking
about
were
people
being
injured.
but
if
we're
dealing
with
radiation
emissions,
then
however
the
state
may
put
the
label,
if
my
property
or
my
person
is
injured
by
the
emission
of
radiation
and
i
suffer
an
injury,
i
have
one
of
these
lawsuits.
so
that
i
think
the
answer
would
be
yes.
but
certainly
in
this
category,
in
the
kerr-mcgee--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
i
think
if...
i
think
the
question
of
whether
a
state
court
could
enjoin
a
nuisance
would
be
much
more
troubling,
because
there
you
would
be
doing
not
that
which
congress
so
clearly
had
in
mind,
which
is
conferring
damages,
but
there
you
would
be,
in
effect,
revoking
the
license
of
the
plant
to
operate.
i
think
there's
a
very
serious
question
whether
in
light
of
pg&e
that
could
be
done.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is
our
submission,
your
honor.
yes,
that's
right.
now...
now,
i
do
want
to
note
we
have
in
our
brief
noted
that
there...
it
is
unmistakable
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
in
1966
after
this
bill
believed...
and
it
was
the
agency
administering
the
statute...
believed
that
punitive
damages
were
available.
in
the
limited
time
i
have
remaining
i
don't
want
to
focus
on
that.
but
the
point
that
i
do
want
to
focus
on
and
close
with
is
that
congress
made
a
judgment
repeatedly
articulated
in
this
legislative
history
that
except
where
we're
dealing
with
an
eno,
there
is
no
reason
why
these
plants
should
be
treated
under
the
tort
law
any
differently
than
any
other
plant.
and
kerr-mcgee
is
here
saying
ah,
but
because
we're
a
nuclear
operator,
we
ought
to
be
exempted
from
the
rules
that
are
applicable
in
tort
suits
against
every
other
plant.
whatever
the
logic
that
they
could
spin
out
for
that,
that
is
not
the
decision
that
congress
made,
and
the
legislative
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
congress
made
the
opposite
decision.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
everyone
on
the
other
side
concedes
the
state
may
do
that.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
okay.
but
then--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--then
i
take
it
is
our
submission...
it
is
our
submission
and
their
submission
that
the
state
can
say
notwithstanding
your
compliance
with
the
federal
standards,
which
the
federal
government
says
are
no
guarantee
of
safety...
this
is
cost-benefit;
this
is
what
we
say
we
want...
notwithstanding
full
compliance
with
that,
you
can
still
do
incredible
damage
to
people.
and
if
a
state
chooses
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--absolutely.
a
state
can
have
a
negligence
standard,
and
a
jury
will
sit
there
and
decide
did
you
run
your
plant
safely;
and
congress
said
that's
exactly
what
we
want.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
punitive
damages
would
be
part
of
the
very
cause
of
action,
but
the
statute
has
in
it,
price-anderson
has
in
it
a
provision
that
where
the
total
recoveries
of
all
elements
of
damage
exceed
the
$560
million
limit
of
liability
the
court
will
make
apportionments
based
on
which
elements
of
recovery
are
the
most
deserving.
and
we
would
certainly
assume
that
compensatory
would
come
before--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no.
the
statute
simply
says
that
the
district
court
shall
make
such
allocations
or
priorities
of
allocation
as
in
its
judgment
it
deems
just.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
there
is
some
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
that
personal
should
come
before
property.
that
discussion
does
not
have
a
reference
one
way
or
the
other
to
punitive.
and
that,
i
believe...
i
don't
know
if
it
was
in
a
report.
i
think
it
was
during
the
hearings
somebody
asked
that
question;
they
had
that
discussion.
this
is,
as
we
stated
at
the
outset,
solely
a
question
of
legislative
intent.
and
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
throughout
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
no
one
is
prepared
to
crack
the
binder
and
look
at
what
congress
said.
all
of
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
flow
from
a
logic,
it
would
make
sense
for
congress
to
do
this
or
it
would
make
sense
for
congress
to
do
that.
as
we've
indicated,
congress
told
us
what
it
did,
and
that
is
the
answer
here.
but
the
logic
wouldn't
work,
and
i
want
to
focus
on
the
government's
argument
about
the
scope
of
nrc
regulations
and
how
since
the
nrc
is
punishing,
why
do
we
need
juries
punishing
as
well...
an
argument
that
i
assume
would
extend
as
well
to
the
state
criminal
law,
that
anything--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
why
would
it
extend?
because
i
don't
know
how
one
could
attribute
to
congress,
at
least
from
the
legislative
history
we've
got,
a
dividing
line
that
says
the
state
can
take
the
same
malicious
conduct
or
reckless
conduct
and
if
it
calls
it
a
crime,
then
it
is
free
to
punish
it,
but
if
it
calls
it
punitive
damages,
then
it
is
not
free
to
do
it.
i'm
not
saying
congress
couldn't
make
that
distinction.
that
i'm
saying
is
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
statute
or
in
the
logic
of
the
legislative
history
that
could
allow
one
to
conclude
that
that
was
the
line
that
congress
actually
drew
here.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
it
isn't
true
that
two
punishments
are
the
same.
the
federal
government
is
punishing
violations
of
its
regulations.
the
deterrent
purpose
is
that
so
people
won't
violate
the
regulations
again.
the
state,
through
punitive
damages,
is
punishing
outrage,
outrageous
conduct
motivated
outrageously
that
inflicts
injury
on
its
citizens.
its
deterrent
purpose
is
to
get
this
wrongdoer
to
stop
hurting
people.
now,
that
isn't
limited.
in
this
case
it
happens
that
the
outrage
was
perpetrated
with
plutonium,
but
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
state
extends
to
everything
that
kerr-mcgee
does.
kerr-mcgee
doesn't
just
handle
plutonium.
and
even
this
plant
has
other
ways
that
people
can
be
hurt.
the
state's
concern
is
that
it
has
found
a
defendant
that
proceeds
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
safety
of
its
citizens,
and
the
function
of
punitive
damages
is
to
make
that
defendant
stop
doing
what
it
does
with
reckless
disregard.
it
isn't
in
any
way
confined
to
plutonium
or
limited
to.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
act
defines
the...
that
it
assigns
certain
functions
to
the
atomic
energy--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--we
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
regulation
that
we
understand
congress
to
have
given
to
the
federal
government
is
the
federal
government's
alone.
that
regulation...
and
we
acknowledge
that
it
is
in
at
least
some
sense
regulation...
this
court
said
so
in
the
garman
case...
that
flows
both
from
compensatory
and
from
punitive
damages.
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
passed
in
the
federal
government
alone.
now,
i
want
to
end
by
pointing
out
one
other
thing,
and
that
is,
if
you
read
mr.
kepler's
testimony...
he's
the
aec
man...
the
description
of
their
role
is
not
as
indicated
here.
