mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
has
been
noted,
this
case
comes
to
the
court
as
a
$5,000
property
damage
case,
the
personal
injury
aspects
of
the
case
having
been
disposed
of
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
not
the
subject
of
appeal
here.
the
liability
for
that
$5,000
in
property
damages
resulted
from
a...
on
the
basis
of
a
liability
without
fault
under
the
doctrine
of
strict
liability.
the
plaintiff
conceded
that
he
did
not
and
could
not
prove
how
the
contamination
to
karen
silkwood's
property
occurred.
now,
the
question,
the
principal
question
raised
by
this
case
is
whether
an
award
of
punitive
damages
with
respect
to
a
claim
based
on
radiation
hazards
resulting
from
the
operation
of
a
federally
licensed
and
regulated
plutonium
plant
is
preempted
by
the
atomic
energy
act.
as
has
been
noted,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
been
reserved.
just
a
brief
comment
on
that.
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
make
jurisdiction
in
this
court
for
mandatory
appeal
under
section
1254.2
of
the
judicial
code.
that
section
is
to
be
strictly
and
narrowly
construed.
it
permits
mandatory
appeal
only
when
the
court
of
appeals
invalidates
a
state
statute
as
being
repugnant
to
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
the
state
statute
which
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
invoke
was
not
even
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals,
much
less
held
invalid
either
facially
or
as
applied.
all
the
court
did
here
was
hold
punitive
damages
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
cannot
be
awarded;
and
thus
we
urge
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
also,
we
suggest
to
you
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
take
on
certiorari.
its
unique
facts
make
it
very
unlikely
that
it
will
have
any
precedential
value,
and
the
basic
principle
upon
which
it
relies...
namely,
that
stated
in
pacific
gas
and
electric...
does
not
involve
any
conflict
in
the
circuits
but
is
now
well
settled
in
light
of
your
decision
last
term.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
in
your
decision
in
pacific
gas
and
electric
you
described
two
forms
of
preemption,
both
of
which
are
applicable
here.
first,
you
said
there
is
preemption
if
the
congress
has
fully
occupied
a
field.
you
also
said
there
is
preemption
even
if
congress
does
not
fully
occupy
a
field
if
the
state
action
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
purpose.
both
those
preemptions
exist
in
this
case
and
require
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
let's
talk
about
the
first
one
first.
in
pg&e--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
they
used
the...
the
preemption
on
the
basis
of
entire
occupation
of
field,
but
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
they
also
had
in
mind
that
in
this
particular
case
there
is
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
purpose.
in
your
decision
in
pg&e
you
removed
any
doubt
that
congress
has
fully
occupied
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
nuclear
hazards
and
the
safety
in
the
operation
of
a
radiation
facility.
and
that
applies
whether
it's
a
nuclear
reactor
or
whether
it's
a
plutonium
plant.
this
is
a
licensed
facility--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
let
me
deal
with
that...
that
point
right
now.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
suggestion
here,
the
argument
here
that
there
is...
that
compensatory
damages
are
also
preempted
and
that
somehow
the
court
was
inconsistent
in
holding
that
punitive
damages
were
preempted
and
compensatories
were
not
i
believe
is
wrong
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
congress
in
the
price-anderson
act
and
in
the
legislative
history
related
to
the
price-anderson
act
indicated
an
intention
that
with
respect
to
the
compensation
of
injured
victims,
making
them
whole,
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
that
they
should
have
available
state
tort
law
remedies.
no
such
intention
with
respect
to
punitive
damage
was
ever
expressed.
secondly,
and
probably
more
important,
the
argument
of
the
plaintiff
here
ignores
the
distinction
between
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages.
punitive
damages
have
as
their
sole
function
controlling
of
conduct,
conduct
that
the
jury
believes
does
not
meet
the
safety
standard
that
should
be
applied.
compensatory
damages,
on
the
other
hand,
have
as
their
primary
function
the
recompensing
of
the
injured
plaintiff;
in
other
words,
making
the
plaintiff
whole.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
i
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
there
is
a
nonsafety
rationale
as
well,
and
that
is
the
making
whole
of
the
innocent
injured
victim
of
a
nuclear
incident.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe,
particularly
in
oklahoma,
the
law
is
that
punitive
damages
are
to
punish
and
deter
conduct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
principle
just
last
term
in
smith
v.
wade
where
it
said
the
purposes
of
punitive
damage
is
to
punish
reprehensible
conduct
and
deter
the
defendant
and
others
from
engaging
in
that
conduct
in
the
future.
in
fact,
under
oklahoma
law
if
punitive
damages
do
not
have
the
effect
of
punishing
and
deterring
conduct,
they
will
not
be
permitted
to
stand.
the
case
cited
in
our
brief,
the
nixon
case,
stands
for
that
proposition.
and
in
the
most
recent
brief
filed
last
week
by
the
plaintiff,
its
reply
brief,
there's
cited
a
new
oklahoma
punitive
damage
case.
it's
the
most
recent
statement
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
on
the
subject
of
punitive
damages.
that
case
not
only
restates
all
the
principles
that
we
expressed
in
our
brief
concerning
the
role
of
punitive
damages,
but
it
has
this
additional
statement.
it
said,
"unlike
the
purpose
of
compensatory
damages,
which
are
to
benefit
the
individual
plaintiff,
punitive
damages
are
imposed
to
benefit
society.
"
"the
plaintiff
acts
as
a
private
attorney
general
to
punish
the
culpable
wrongdoer,
thereby
encouraging
adherence
to
safety
standards
that
benefit
consumers
generally.
"
so
what
the
court
in
the
theory
v.
armstrong
case
at
661
pacific
second
and
cited
in
the
second
footnote
to
the
plaintiff's
reply
brief,
has
made
it
clear
is
that
punitive
damages
in
oklahoma
are
for
the
purpose
of
imposing
a
safety
standard
and
then
enforcing
it.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
what
the
oklahoma
court
i
think
has
said
is
that
compensatory
damages
have...
and
the...
as
their
basis
the
intention
to
benefit
the
plaintiff,
to
make
him
whole
for
the
wrong
he
has
suffered.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
actually,
in
oklahoma
you
do
not
because
there's...
it's
strict
liability
in
oklahoma.
so
irrespective
of
the
conduct
you
engage
in,
if
it's
your
plutonium,
you're
liable.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
not
with
respect
to
the
property
damage.
the
property
damage--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--well,
let
me...
let
me--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--let
me
respond
this
way.
that
question
is
not
before
you.
that's
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
i
understand
it
is
before
me
right
now.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
and
my
response...
my
response
is
on
the
state
of
the
present
law
under...
i
would
say
the
compensatory
damages
are
not
preempted.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
if...
if
indeed...
if
indeed
the
state-imposed
standard
of
safety
is
a
negligence
standard.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
argue
that
if
indeed
the
plant
is
in
complete
conformity
with
federal
law,
there
is
no
way
of
finding,
there's
no
basis
for
finding
that
it
was
not
operated
reasonably
and--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--we
rely
on
that
because
that
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
below,
that's
true.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
there
is
a
conflict,
however,
that
i
want
to
deal
with.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
reason
i'm
conceding
on
compensatory
damages
is
because
while
compensatory
damages
may
have
a
regulatory
effect
and
they
may
produce
a
safety
benefit,
they
have
as
well
a
nonsafety
rationale,
and
that
is,
making
whole
the
plaintiff
who
has
been
injured,
who
has
suffered
a
loss.
this
court
said...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
your
opinion
you
said
the
ration...
the
question
we
must
ask--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--that
was
the...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
question
we
must
ask
in
pacific
gas
and
electric
was
is
there
a
nonsafety
rationale
for
the
state
action,
for
the
state
statute
involved
there.
now,
if
we
apply
that
same
question
here,
we
can
see
a
difference
between
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages,
because
if
we
ask
that
question
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages,
we
have
to
say
that
there
is
a
nonsafety
rationale,
and
that
rationale
is
to
make
whole,
to
recompense
the
injured
plaintiff
who
has
suffered
damage
because
of
a
nuclear
incident.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
whether
it
be
because
of
a
standard
of
care
or
not.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
it
may
very
well
turn
on
that
point,
your
honor.
i
think,
however,
generally
speaking
the
law
of
this
country
is
that
compensatory
damages
by
definition
are
not...
i
mean
punitive
damages
by
definition
are
not
compensatory
but
indeed
are
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
alleged
wrongdoing
and
establishing
a
safety
standard.
after
all,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
whether
under
oklahoma
law
and
the
purposes
of
oklahoma...
of
punitive
damages
in
oklahoma
we
have
preemption.
if
we
ask
that
same
question...
is
there
a
nonsafety
rationale
for
the
state
action
in
the
case
of
punitive
damages...
we
can
only
reach
one
answer.
there
is
no
rationale
other
than
safety
with
respect
to
punitives.
and
that
is
particularly
so
in
oklahoma.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
punishment
of
the
offender
still
has
as
its
purpose,
i
submit,
safety.
it
has
no
other
purpose.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
compensatory
has
that
element
plus
the
element
of
making
the
injured
plaintiff
whole,
which
is
not
present
with
respect
to
punitive
damages.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
well,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
punishment
has
a
safety
rationale
and
a
safety
rationale
only.
why...
we
only
punish
because
this
particular
defendant
has
not
lived
up
to
the
safety
standard
that
the
jury
has
been
convinced
is
the
appropriate
safety
standard
to
apply.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that
a
criminal
statute
is
different.
i...
if...
obviously
if
someone
takes...
chooses
plutonium
as
the
means
by
which
to
commit
a
crime
as
opposed
to
using
a
knife
or
some
other--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--your
honor,
i...
i
don't
mean
to
dodge
your
question.
i
have
trouble
under...
i
have
trouble
conceding
a
circumstance
because
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
general
operations
of
this
plant
and
how
there
could
be
a
statute
that--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--oh,
well,
your
honor--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--if
you...
if
you...
if
you
examine
those
facts
in...
unfortunately,
many
of
those
facts
were
contained
in
a
series
of
footnotes
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
and
we
didn't
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
those.
had
they
been
in
the
opening
brief,
we
would
have.
suffice
it
to
say,
and
the
bottom
line,
i
think,
on
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
regional
director
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
who
had
responsibility
for
this
plant.
he
testified
that
it
was
the
view
of
his
agency
that
the
plant
was
safely
operated.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
oh,
well,
your
honor,
if
i
could
just
talk
briefly
about
those.
those
are
matters
which
were...
were,
i
submit,
not
the
basis
of
the
punitive
damage
award
in
this
case.
let
me
just
give
you
an
illustration
of
one
of
them.
one
of
them
said,
for
example,
that
there
was
a
period
of...
a
contamination
incident
or
contamination
was
permitted
to
exist
for
14
days.
it
sounds
like
there's
some
contamination
out
there
that
creates
a
danger,
a
risk.
if
you
read
the
backup
materials
on
that
what
you'll
see
is
we
had
a
vacuum
cleaner
that
we
had
trouble
cleaning,
and
so
that
they
couldn't
get
it
clean,
so
they
decided
to
put
it
in
a
bag
and
put
it
aside
and
decide
whether
they
could
find
a
way
to
clean
that
or
whether
they
had
to
throw
the
vacuum
cleaner
away.
it
took
14
days
to
make
that
decision.
there
was
no
exposure
of
the
public
or
workers
or
anybody
to
health.
the
reason
that
was
rejected
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
is
that
it
created
no
health
or
safety
problem.
the
whole
argument
on
that
point...
i'm
kind
of
getting
out
of
order
here...
but
the
whole
argument
on
that
point,
i
submit,
misses
the
point
of
what
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
does.
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
has
broad
discretion
in
the
regulation
of
plants
such
as
this
and
does
indeed
control
them.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
no.
i--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--obviously,
i
do
not
submit
that,
your
honor.
let
me
turn...
let
me
turn
to
the--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--sure.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
that's
right.
compensatory,
yes,
but
not--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--yes,
but
you
see,
it's
the--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--well,
what's
wrong
with
it
is
it
conflicts
with
the
intention
of
congress.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
because
what
congress
has
done
is
said
we're
going
to
have
a...
not
a...
we
don't
want
a
dual
regulatory
system.
we
want
a
single
regulatory
system--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--injuries,
no,
your
honor.
they
gave
to...
to
the
agency
the
power
to
impose
sanctions
and
to--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--oh,
that's
true,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
and
because
that...
the
function
there
is
regulatory,
and
that's
the
function
that
has
been
delegated
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
congress
has
occupied
this
field,
the...
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
federal
purposes,
specifically
the
purpose
to
encourage
widespread
participation
in
the
development
of
atomic
energy
for
peaceful
purposes,
and
the
express
desire
and
intention
of
congress
to
have
dual
regulation
of
radiation
hazard...
to
not
have
dual
regulation
of
radiation
hazards.
if
a
state
passed
a
law
or
an
administrative
agency
adopted
a
rule
which
imposed
a
standard
upon
a
nuclear
facility,
even
the
plaintiff
would
concede
that's
preempted.
but
he
argues
somehow
punitive
damages
are
different.
but
what
is
the
saving
difference?
giving
the
jury
the
power
to
devise
the
safety
standard
is
no
different
than
having
it
done
by
a
state
agency
except
that
it
varies
from
case
to
case,
and
it's
subject
to
all
the
whims
and
vagaries
of
juries
and
the
ability
of
counsel
to
inflame
them.
but
the
result
is
the
same.
it's
the
state
standard
of
safety
which
controls
the
plant
and
not
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission's
standard
of
safety
which
this
court
has
already
held
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
that
subject.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
your
honor,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
is
no
evidence
here
of
what
caused
this
damage.
the
plaintiff
conceded
that
he
could
not
prove
what
caused
this
damage.
and
that
brings
me
to
this
point
with
respect
to
the
property
damage
award.
and
if
i
could
just
close
for
a
minute
on
that
point.
when
this
case
is
reduced
to
a
$5,000
property
damage
case,
as
it
is,
there
is
no
predicate
for
the
punitive
damages
because
there
is
no
showing
of
the
cause
of
that
property
damage
award.
and
under
oklahoma
law
if
it
wasn't
caused
by
an
act
which
was
reckless
or
accompanied
by
malice,
it
cannot
be
the
basis
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
c.
lee
cook,
jr.
it
would
be,
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
basis
for
your
affirming
also,
because
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
cause
of
the
damage
to
the
property.
thank
you.
