unknown
speaker
now,
the
only
compensatory
damage
award
that
remains
in
the
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
$5,000
property
damage
award.
unknown
speaker
and
the
entire
$10
million
punitive
damages
has
to
hang
then
on
the
$5,000
property
damage,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
at
present?
unknown
speaker
does
oklahoma
law,
so
far
as
you
know,
as
to
punitive
damages
draw
any
distinction
between
a
property
damage
award
and
a
personal
injury
award?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
even
if
you
won,
it
would
be
remanded
then
to
determine
whether
that
damages
award
is
adequate
as
premised
or...
or
excessive...
excuse
me...
excessive
as
premised
on
only
a
$5,000
property--
unknown
speaker
--yet,
mr.
gottesman,
the
position
you
take
that
punitive
damages
are
primarily
to
punish
suggests,
at
least
in
your
view,
that
the
punitive
damages
serve
a
much
different
purpose
than
compensatory
damages,
which
i
suppose
are
just
to
make
whole.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
it
would
be
more
likely
if
they
had
to
choose
that
they
would
have
preempted
compensatory
damages?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
logically,
though,
punitive
damages
are
in
a
sense
regulatory,
and
it
was
congress'
intent
to
leave
in
place...
to
leave
the
regulatory
aspects
to
the
nrc
for
safety
purposes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
are
you
conceding,
in
effect,
that
the
radioisotopes
involved
here
are
subject
to
the
same
preemption
doctrine
as
perhaps
the
operation
of
a
nuclear
reactor
would
have
been?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
then
that,
for
instance,
damages
to
the
public
arising
out
of
a
terrorist
attack
on
a
nuclear
facility
would
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
would
a
state
tort
action
lie
in
the
nature
of
a
nuisance
suit
against
a
power
plant,
a
nuclear
power
plant?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't...
you're
not
troubled
by
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
pg&e
case
about
the
preemption?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
that
pg&e
dealt
with
safety
regulation
by
the
states
as
such,
by
a
commission
or
perhaps
by
a
nuisance
action,
but
it
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
perhaps
things
that
are
tangentially
concerned
with
safety
but
primarily
devoted
to
compensation
or
punishment
were
also
to
be
swept
under
the
rug
with
safety
concerns.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr....
mr....
mr.
gottesman,
if
the...
if
the
plant
is
complying
in
all
respects
safety
wise
with
federal
standards
and
federal
regulations
but
the
state
nevertheless
and
by
virtue
of
its
tort
standards
says
that
you
must
conduct
your
plant
differently,
you
must
run
your
plant
differently
or
you're
going
to
be
subject
to
a
damage
suit,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
us
whether
you're
complying
with
the
federal
law
or
not;
you
have
to
comply
with
this
safety
standard
or
you're
going
to
be
held
to
be
negligent.
that's
essentially
your
submission,
that
the
state
may
do
that.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that
concessions
can
find
the
court
very
easily.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
people
frequently
try
to
concede
that--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
states
can
say
you
just
didn't
run
your
plant
safely,
so
you're
subject
to
damages.
unknown
speaker
which
one
did
the
court
of
appeals
use,
both
or
just
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cook,
if
you're
right
in
that,
i
suppose...
and
although
the
california
case
involved
state
regulation
licensing
requirements...
if
you're
going
to
carry
that
over
en
bloc
to
state
tort
law,
which
i
don't
think
that
statement
from
pg&e
at
all
requires,
i
take
it
compensatory
damages
would
also
be
preempted.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
surely
you
don't
suggest
that
when
the
state
court
said
charges
on
negligence
sufficient
to
support
a
recovery
of
compensatory
damages
it
isn't
laying
down
a
standard
of
care
directed
to
safety?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
isn't
there
also
a
nonsafety
rationale
to
punitive
damages
in
the
sense
of
punishing
someone
who
is
regarded
as
having
deliberately
done
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
the
oklahoma
court
said
that
compensatory
damages
are
not
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
what
wrong,
though.
isn't
it
as...
as...
as
the
justice
has
said,
you
have
to
show
that
some
standard
of
conduct
has
been
violated
before
you're
going
to
get--
unknown
speaker
--is
that...
and
the
jury
was
instructed
both
on
negligence
and
strict
liability,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
now
let's
talk
about
personal
injury.
you...
you
would
say
that...
you
would
say
that
compensatory
damages
for
personal
injuries
are
not
preempted.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
you
had
conceded.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
before
you
right
now.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
an
answer.
unknown
speaker
even
though...
even
though
in
the
process
of
awarding
them
you
find
that
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
has
not
lived
up
to
some
state-imposed
standard
of
safety?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
though...
even
though
the
plant
is
in
complete
conformity
with
federal
law
as
far
as
safety
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is...
there
is
the
state
has
a
different
standard
or
purports
to
impose
a
standard
that's
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
but
you
don't
purport
in
this
case,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
to
point...
to
rely
for
your
preemption
analysis
on
any
conflict
of
federal
law.
it's
more
general
preemption.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
if
there
is,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
concede
on
compensatory
damages.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
court's
opinion.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
under--
unknown
speaker
--under
your
analysis
then
it
would
depend
solely
on
the
oklahoma
law.
if
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
had
said
that
our
punitive
damages
are
just
to
make
sure
a
plaintiff
is
really
compensated...
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
safety...
presumably
the
punitive
damages
would
go
the
same
way
as
compensatory
damages
under
arkansas
law,
even
though
it's
a
federal
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
well,
punishment
of
the
offender.
unknown
speaker
well,
compensatory
has
the
same
element.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
punitive
has
the
element
of
punishing
plus
safety.
i
mean
you
can
say
one...
each
one
of
them
has
two
components
if
you
want
to
break
it
down
that
way.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
cook,
what
about
criminal
laws?
say
the
criminal
statute
provided
for
punishment
for
precisely
the
conduct
that
was
involved
here.
i
think
you've
conceded
that
would
not
be
preempted.
unknown
speaker
say
the
statute...
say
they
had
a
statute...
i
can't
recite
these
rather
complicated
facts...
the
facts
as
we
disclose
by
this
record
if
done
maliciously
and
so
forth
and
so
on
shall
constitute
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
oklahoma
punishable
by
a
fine
$10
million,
would
that
be
preempted?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
briefs
indicate
there
are
unusual
facts
here.
unknown
speaker
and
we...
so
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
facts
as
your
opponent
describes
them
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
ruled
against
you.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
they
had
some
kind
of
a
safety
report
that
said
there
were
about
18
or
20
safety
problems,
none
of
which
violated
the
federal
regulations.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
genera
question.
do
you
contend
that
the
state
could
not
make
it
a
crime
to
do
anything
that
is
authorized
by
the
federal
agency?
if
a
federal
agency
authorizes
it,
then
the
company
is
immune
from
criminal
liability?
that
the
federal
agency
has
not
prohibited
it,
i
should
say?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
say
that.
unknown
speaker
just
before
you
turn--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
that
there
is
a
safety
standard
issued
by
the
nrc
which
is...
which
the
plant
and
the
company
is
supposed
to
live
up
to.
suppose
that
they
did
not,
and
it's
plain.
plainly
they
did
not,
and
it
created...
it
hurt
somebody,
like
silkwood.
and
it
hurt
somebody,
and
it's...
the...
it's
shown
that
the
company
negligently,
if
not
recklessly,
disregarded
the
federal
safety
standard.
state
tort
suit.
i
would
suppose
that
consistent
with
your
theory
you
would
say
that
punitive
damages
would
not
be
authorized
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
even
though...
even
if...
even
if
the
purpose
of
imposing
the
punitive
damages
was
regulatory
in
the
sense
we
want
you
to
make
sure
to
live
up
to
federal
standards.
unknown
speaker
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
certainly
didn't...
didn't
reserve
for
itself
the
awarding
of
damages
for
injuries
caused
by
violations
of
federal
standards.
they
certainly
left
that
to
the
states,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
said
the...
the...
the
power
to
award
damages
to
people
who
are
hurt
by
the
violation
of
federal
standards.
unknown
speaker
they
left
that
to
the
states.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
a
state
could
not
when
a
violation
of
a
federal
standard
is
found
impose
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
live
up
to
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
injuries
in
this
case
were
caused
by
conduct
that
was
perfectly
proper
under
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
question's
still
open,
isn't
it,
in
the...
even...
even
if...
even
if
we
reversed,
wouldn't
that...
would
that
issue
still
be
open
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
radioisotope,
mr.
garvey?
unknown
speaker
certainly
it's
fairly
important
to
determine
in
deciding
whether
this
has
been
preempted
or
not,
under
the
government's
theory,
isn't
it,
when
the
joint
committee
report
in
'59
says
we're
leading...
leaving
radioisotopes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
one
thing
congress
said
was
that
we're
leaving
radioisotopes
to
the
states.
unknown
speaker
and
what's
your
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
so
your...
your
point
is...
is...
is
that
if...
that
if
had
been
shown
that
kerr-mcgee
was
responsible
for
the
presence
of
that
plutonium,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't...
there
wouldn't
be
any
intention
to...
there
wouldn't
be
any
bar,
though,
to
a...
to
a
state
court
action
for
compensatory
damages--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
violation
of
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
right,
right.
so
there
was
no
intent
to
preempt
the
state
damage
action.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
garvey,
the
civil
fines
imposed
by
the
nrc,
do
they
go
to
a
person
who's
claiming
injury
or
do
they
go
to
the
government?
unknown
speaker
so
that
isn't
exactly
analogous
then
to
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
there.
the
impact
on
the
wrongdoer,
if
he
is
a
wrongdoer,
is
the
same
whether
the
money
goes
to
the
government
or
whether
it
goes
to
the
private
claimant.
unknown
speaker
it
has
a
deterrent
effect.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
that
in
the
process
of
awarding
compensatory
damages
if
in
a
particular
case
the
state
was
attempting
to
impose
a
standard
of
performance
inconsistent
with
federal
law,
that
would
pose
a
different
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
aren't
answering
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
you
if
the
state
was
awarding
damages
in
accordance
with
some
standard
of
care
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law.
they
didn't
work...
suppose
the
state
isn't...
doesn't
purport
to
award
damages
on
a
strict
liability
basis.
they
are
awarding
damages
because
you
failed
to
run
your
plant
this
particular
way,
and
it
just
happens
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gottesman,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
commence?
if
there
were
a
nuclear
disaster
and
hundreds
of
people
were
injured
or
killed
and
their
claims
exceeded
the
$560
million,
i
assume
that
each
of
the
claimants
would
be
entitled
to
a
pro
rata
part
of
that
sum.
unknown
speaker
and
would
they
then
be
entitled
to
bring
punitive
action
suits?
unknown
speaker
does
the
statute
make
that
clear,
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
sheds
any
light
on
that?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
why?
you
said
it
would
extend--
unknown
speaker
--that
does
divide
the
regulation
of
the
production
of
atomic
energy,
does
not
it
not,
between
the
state
and
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
your
response,
your
analysis
puts
the
jurisdiction
in
two
places
at
the
same
time.
