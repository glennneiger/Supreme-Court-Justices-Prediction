mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
make
just
two
points.
the
first
of
them
is
that
the
federal
regulations
in
this
case
do
exactly
what
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
trying
to
do
through
the
imposition
of
punitive
damages.
and
the
second
point
is
that
there
is
indeed
a
difference
between
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
which
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
punitive
damages
and
intended
to
encourage
compensatory
damages.
let
me
just
say
a
few
words
about
my
first
point,
which
is
that
federal
regulation
is
not
only
adequate
to
cover
this
case
but
also
does
exactly
what
oklahoma
did.
the
atomic
energy
act
in
section
2077a
and
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
nrc
in
section
70.3
say
that
you
can't
possess
plutonium
without
a
license.
they
also
say
that
you
can't
transfer
plutonium
except
to
a
licensee.
there
is
no
limit
on
the
amount
of
plutonium
that
they're
speaking
about.
that
means
that
with
respect
to
the
300
micrograms
that
were
found
in
silkwood's
apartment
in
this
case
that
if
either
party
had
been
responsible
for
the
transfer
or
the
possession
of
that
plutonium
in
the
apartment,
it
would
have...
it
would
have
violated
both
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
wish
i
knew.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
when
congress
used
the
words
radioisotope
in
1959
they
meant
maybe
things
like
cobalt
60
and...
and--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--oh,
there
is...
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
but
that
congress
attempted
to
preempt
the
operation
of
plutonium
fuel
fabrication
facilities
in
all
their
respects.
in
the
'59
report
the...
the...
well,
what
congress
said
was--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
is
not
radioisotope
within
the
meaning
of
that
discussion.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
aec
analysis
of
the
bill,
which
appears
in
105
congressional
record
'83-'84,
and
if
you
read
the
house
and
senate
reports
that
accompany
the
1959
amendments,
it's
clear
that
congress
made
a
distinction
between
facilities
that
possess
special
nuclear
material
in
quantities
sufficient
to
form
a
critical
mass,
and
this
was
such
a
facility,
on
the
one
hand.
and
radioisotopes
that
are
used
for
medical
purposes
or
related
uses,
on
the
other
hand.
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
congress
intended
to
cover
this
facility.
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
the...
that
the
amount
of
plutonium
found
in
her
apartment,
had
kerr-mcgee
been
responsible
for
its
presence
there,
would
have
violated
both
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
i
might
go
on
to
say
that
the
regulations
also
provide
in
great
detail
for
the...
for
the
protection
of
workers
in
plutonium
and
processing
facilities
like
this
one.
they
talk
about
what
sort
of
precautionary
procedures
have
to
be
taken
in
handling
plutonium.
they
also
set
exposure
limitations
which...
which...
which
apply
to
this
case.
the
baseline
exposure
limitation
is
that
operators
of
these
kinds
of
facilities
have
to
keep
exposures
as
low
as
reasonably
achievable.
now,
any
willful
exposure
to
plutonium
almost
by
definition
violates
the
as
low
as
reasonably
achievable
standard,
but
it
might
also
say
that
the
amount
of
plutonium
that
the
nrc
discovered
on
its
investigation
in
this
case...
that
was
discovered
at
the
autopsy,
had
it
been
received
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
even
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
would
also
have
violated
the
numerical
limitations
that
are
found
at
the
end
of
part
20
of
10
cfr.
in
addition
to
that
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme,
the
nrc
imposes
on
licensees
specifically
tailored
license
conditions
to
make
sure
that
these
plants
are
operated
safely.
in
this
case
the
license
was
about
that
thick.
it
was
introduced
as
exhibits--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--yes.
i
want
to
go
farther
than
that,
because
the
nrc
conducted
an
investigation,
and
its
report
is
reproduced
as
an
appendix
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case.
the
nrc
concluded
that
the
appellees
had
not
violated
the
federal
regulations.
if
they
had
concluded
that
there
had
been
a
violation,
the
current
procedures,
which
you
will
find
in
appendix
c
to
part
2
of
10
cfr,
say,
for
example,
that
the
nrc
can
impose
civil
fines
for
any
significant
failure
to
control
licensed
material.
that
would
include
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it
would
not.
in
fact,
congress
intended
to
encourage
awards
of
punitive...
of
compensatory
damages.
the
nrc
has
no
authority
to
award
compensatory
damages.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
indeed
not.
in
fact,
the
price-anderson
act
rests
on
the
assumption
that
state
compensatory
damages
actions
are
permissible.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
enacted
section
2282
for
the
specific
purpose
of
allowing
the
nrc
itself
to
impose
civil
fines.
and
as
this
court
noted
in
gertz
against
robert
welch,
punitive
damages
are
nothing
other
than
private
fines
levied
by
civil
juries.
there
are
a
number
of
differences
between
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
which
make
clear
congress'
intent.
that
first
is
that
the
statute
treats
them
differently.
it
leaves
to
the
states
the
award
of
compensatory
damages.
it
gives
to
the
nrc
the
authority
to
impose
civil
fines.
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
appellant
suggests
that
in
some
way
reading
the--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--well,
they
go
to
the
government.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
it's
not
exactly
analogous,
although
oklahoma
law
recognizes
that...
that
the
collection
of
punitive
damages
isn't
a
right
of
the
private
party.
it's
really
a
private
party
acting
as
a
private
attorney
general
on
behalf
of
the
public.
so
i
think
where
they
go
is
really
a
matter
of
insignificance.
appellant
suggests
that
in
some
way
it's
strange
that
congress
might--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that's
correct.
appellant
suggests
that
in
some
way
it's
strange
that
congress
should
have
drawn
this
line
between
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
but
it's
done
in
any
number
of
other
statutes
as
this
court
has
recognized.
if
this
had
been...
if
this
facility
had
been
a
federal
facility,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
have
subjected
the
government
to
state
standards
for
negligence
in
suits
for
compensation
but
would
not
have
permitted
suits
for
punitive
damages.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
railway
labor
act,
suits
brought
under
that
act
permit
compensation
but
not
punitive
damages.
section
303
of
the
labor-management
relations
act
permits
compensation
but
not
punitive
damages
precisely
because
of
the
effect
that
they
have
on
future
conduct.
that's,
i
might
add,
a
sensible
reason
for
drawing
a
line
between
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
in
this
case.
in
pacific
gas
and
electric
this
court
said
that
states
were
free
to
reject
nuclear
power
if
it
cost
too
much,
but
not
because
it
was
unsafe.
i
might
add
the
court's
opinion
said
that
states
were
free
to
reject
nuclear
power
if
it
cost
too
much,
even
though
the
decision
about
cost
entailed
some
thinking
about
safety.
in
the
same
way,
congress
intended
that
the
states
should
be
allowed
to
assure
that
nuclear
power
pay
all
its
costs...
the
cost
of
injury,
the
cost
of
harm...
but
that
they
not
be
allowed
to
go
further
and
punish
nuclear
licensees
for
operating
unsafely.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
that
congress
intended
that
the
states
should
be
allowed
to
award
compensation
under
standards
of
strict
liability.
indeed,
in
the
price-anderson
act
they
wanted
to
encourage
that
in
the
case
of
extraordinary
nuclear
occurrence.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
well,
i
think
i...
i
think
i
am,
because
in
awarding
damages
under
standards
of
strict
liability,
the
state
makes
no
decision
about
standards
of
care.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
find
it
curious
that
appellants
have
turned
that
argument
to
their
own
advantage.
what
they're
really
saying
is
if
the
state,
in
order
to
protect
a
licensee,
decides
to
award
compensatory
damages
in
less
than
all
cases
by
using
a
negligence
barrier
to
collection
that
that
somehow
justifies
the
state
in
awarding
punitive
damages
in
situations
where
the
nrc
would
not
permit
them.
