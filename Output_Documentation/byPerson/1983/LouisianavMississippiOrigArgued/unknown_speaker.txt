unknown
speaker
counsel,
what
page
is
footnote
number
one
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
inconsistent
with
the
thalweg
being
live,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
palmer,
on
reading
footnote
one
of
the
master's
report
to
which
you
refer,
he
says:
"i
take
the
position
of
all
parties
to
be
that
the
location
of
the
louisiana-mississippi
boundary
relative
to
the
bottom
hole
location
of
the
well
must
be
determined
by
reference
to
the
live
thalweg.
"
now,
is
that
an
incorrect
statement
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
is
that
a
correct
statement
if
you
don't
draw
the
implication
from
it
that
you
do,
that
with
respect
to
the
location
of
the
oil
well
that
it's
the
live
thalweg
that
is
going
to
govern?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
counsel,
what
is
a
bottom
hole?
is
there
a
top
hole?
unknown
speaker
sideways?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
concerns
other
than
the
well?
i
take
it
that
you
say
the
period
that
you're
concerned
with
ends
in
1982,
and
to
the
extent
the
thalweg
is
live,
if
you
fix
the
boundary
at
the
end
of
the
period
in
'82,
it
would
no
longer
be
the
boundary
anyway,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
what
are
your
concerns
other
than
the
location
of
the
well
for
the
period
between
'70-whatever
it
is
and
'82?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
setting
the
boundary
at
the
end
of
'82
wouldn't
settle
your
dispute,
would
it,
because
the
thalweg
isn't
there
any
more.
unknown
speaker
the
boundary
has
moved.
i
don't
know,
which
way
has
it
moved?
do
you
know
which
way,
how
it's
moved
since
'82?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
still
interested
in
your
reasons
for
wanting
the...
all
of
your
reasons
for
wanting
the
boundary
as
of
'82
fixed
all
up
and
down
for
that
four-mile
run.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
the
thalweg
is
live,
you
can't
draw
a
metes
and
bounds
boundary.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
magic
about
a
calendar
year?
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
they
get
a
witness
to
testify
as
to
which
side
of
the
property
they're
claiming
the
thalweg
is
then
running
or
is
running
at
the
relevant
date
for
that
case?
unknown
speaker
but
no
one
doubts
the
boundary
is
the
live
thalweg,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
point
at
which
the
dille
family
is
concerned,
i
would
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
they
do
it?
why
can't
they
do
it?
unknown
speaker
louisiana
can't
keep
them
from
going
into
the
lower
federal
court,
can
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you're
here.
but
if
we
don't
determine
the
dispute...
what
if
we
had
turned
down
jurisdiction?
what
if
we
hadn't
permitted
louisiana
to
file?
what
would
they...
just
on
the
grounds
that
the
only
real
issue
involved
was
who
owned
that
oil
well
and
that
was
a
private
matter,
essentially.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
suppose
we
had
turned
it
down?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
could
have
gone
forward
with
proof.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
we
reject
your
exceptions
to
the
master's
report
and
accept
his
report,
i
take
it
the
location
of
the
bottom
hole
of
this
well
is
fixed,
has
been
determined.
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
determine
the
boundary
the
rest
of
the
way,
and
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
what
barrier
there
would
be
to
the
private
owners
in
a
lower
federal
court
to
have
that
boundary
litigated--
unknown
speaker
--if
they
really
have
a
live
question
about
it.
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
exclusive
jurisdiction,
is
there,
in
this
court
just
because
a
state
is
a
party?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
thalweg
is
migrating,
you
can't
get
an
accurate
description
of
the
boundary
from
the
time
it
takes
the
surveyors
to
go
out
and
see
where
the
thalweg
is
on
january
15th
until
the
time
they
can
come
and
testify
before
the
master
on
february
1st.
the
boundary
may
be
different
between
january
15th
and
february
1st.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
only
one
metes
and
bounds
description
of
the
boundary
between
1972
and
1982?
unknown
speaker
there
may
be
a
metes
and
bounds
description
for
every
week
that
would
vary
from
week
to
week.
do
you
want
the
master
to
go
week
by
week
at
it
over
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
master,
to
get
back
to
that,
gave
you
a
metes
and
bounds
description
of
the
dead
part
of
the
thalweg
and
then,
with
respect
to
the
part
of
the
boundary
that
was
covered
by
a
live
thalweg,
simply
described
what
a
thalweg
is,
the
deepest
point
of
the
channel
and
so
forth,
and
gave
no
metes
and
bounds.
would
that
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
i
say
if
the
master
had
given
you
a
metes
and
bounds
description
of
the
dead
part
of
the
thalweg
and
then
had
gone
on
to
say
that
above
that,
if
it
is
above
that,
the
boundary
is
the
live
thalweg
from
point
so
and
so,
whatever
it
is,
latitude
to
point
so
and
so
latitude,
so
that
you
could
figure
out
what
part
of
the
river
was
covered
by
the
live
thalweg,
would
that
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
utility
isn't
there,
either,
because
the
line
could
change
next
week.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
dispute?
just
tell
me
more
concretely,
what
dispute
is
there
between
you
and
the
state
of
louisiana
any
time
from
'72
to
'82
about
anything
except
the
location
of
the
bottom
hole
of
this
well?
just
give
me
a
concrete
example,
what
kind
of
a
claim
is
there
between
the
two
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
give
me
an
example.
are
you
trying
to
tax
something
that
louisiana
says
you
can't
during
those
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
other
kind
of
a
concrete
claim
is
there
between
you
and
louisiana
during
those
ten
years?
just
give
me
a
concrete
example.
or
what
could
be
a
dispute
between
you
and
louisiana
during
those
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
for
those
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
that's
all
gone
now.
you're
not
going
to
be
exercising
any
police
power
now
relating
to
those
ten
years.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
keep
saying
"if".
have
you
done
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
i
think
if
you
had
come
in
to
the
special
master
and
said,
look,
there's
something
else
besides
this
well
that
we're
in
dispute
on,
we're
about
to
establish
these
drilling
units
here
and
louisiana
says
that
they're
on
their
side,
i'm
sure
he
would
have
solved
that
concrete
dispute.
you
haven't
told
me
yet
what
kind
of
a
concrete
dispute
there
is
between
you
and
louisiana,
other
than
this
particular
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
so.
but
you
think
just
because
two
states
want
their
boundary
determined
as
of
any
particular...
say
that
they
come
in
and
say,
we
just
want
our
boundary
fixed
as
of
the
time
the
evidence
is
closed,
as
of
that
very
time;
that
you
have
the
sovereign
right
to
have
that
boundary
fixed?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
true.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
really
that
you
can
have
a
special
master
and
use
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
basically
in
the
capacity
of
a
surveyor;
that
both
parties
can
agree
that
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river
is
the
boundary,
there's
no
argument
about
accretion
versus
avulsion
or
that,
you
know,
that
there
was
an
oxbow
cutoff
or
something
like
that,
but
that
nonetheless
the
master
is
employed
simply
to
plot
the
position
of
a
live
thalweg
as
of
say
january
15th,
1982,
around
the
natchez
bridge?
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that's
a
ridiculous
condition.
maybe
you're
right,
that
we've
done
it
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
mr.
palmer,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
how
much...
forgetting
avulsion
for
the
moment,
because
then
a
boundary
can
really
change
rapidly.
but
if
it's
just
a
matter
of
erosion
and
accretion,
in
a
year
how
much,
over
those
ten
years
how
much
in
your
judgment
did
the
river
ever
change
in
a
year?
at
any
point,
how
much
east
and
west
did
the
boundary
change
in
a
year?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
probably
the
maximum
that
it's
ever
moved,
that
it's
moved
at
any
point
in
any
year?
unknown
speaker
that
may
not
have
much
to
do
with
the
thalweg?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
where
the
thalweg
is.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
rejected.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
he
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--he
considered
them.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimmel,
there
is
discussion
in
the
testimony
about
breaking
down
the
tow.
would
you
tell
us
what
that
term
means--
unknown
speaker
--and
how
it's
relevant?
unknown
speaker
does
the
coast
guard
speak
in
terms
of
right
and
left
on
those
occasions?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
kimmel,
you
say
"his
particular
thalweg".
do
you
think
the
evidence
is
in
the
record
sufficient
to
actually
determine
the
boundary
up
and
down
the
river
for
each
year?
unknown
speaker
for
each
year?
unknown
speaker
not
only
'82,
but
for
each
year.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
thalweg's
been
moving
west
during
these
ten
years,
or
at
least
if
in
part
of
this
stretch
it's
been
moving
west,
louisiana's
been
losing
land
to
mississippi,
and
you
may
not
know
how
much.
if
you
set
the
boundary
in
'82,
june
1,
'82,
the
thalweg
probably
isn't
there
any
more.
but
if
it's
been
moving
west,
you've
been
losing
some
more
land.
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
you
would
know,
if
you
fixed
the
boundary
in
'82,
at
least
you'd
know
as
of
that
date
what
land
mississippi
could
tax
as
compared
to
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
if
so,
why
shouldn't...
i
would
think
you
can
never
keep
up
with
this
problem,
but
at
least
you
can
chase
it.
unknown
speaker
so
has
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
drew
it
you'd
probably
know,
at
least
on
some
stretches
of
the
river,
there'd
be
some
land,
there'd
be
some
land
in
mississippi
that
wasn't
there
in
1960.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know
it's
correct.
unknown
speaker
and
i
don't
know...
i
would
think
it
would
be...
it
might
be
helpful.
unknown
speaker
just
because
it
hasn't
made
much
difference
where
the
boundary
is.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
treating
this
as
if
it
were
a
quiet
title
action
and
you
simply
rule,
in
this
case
rule
for
the
plaintiff
or
rule
for
the
defendant
and,
you
know,
say
that's
all
i
need
to
decide,
because
you're
talking
about
who
owns
this
land
and
i've
now
decided
that,
whereas
perhaps
the
concept
of
original
jurisdiction
is
a
broader
thing,
that
you
ought
to
do
something
by
way
of
deciding
the
actual
location
of
the
boundary
line.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
certainly
did.
you're
the
one
who
wanted
the
boundary.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kimmel,
would
there
have
to
be
more
evidence
taken
to
draw
a
boundary?
unknown
speaker
and
what
kind
of
a
skill
would
it
take
to
look
at
these
hydrographs
and
draw
that
boundary?
unknown
speaker
depending
on
what
expert
you
believed.
unknown
speaker
if
the
master
says,
look,
believe
this
expert
and
don't
believe
that
one--
unknown
speaker
--he
could
draw
it?
unknown
speaker
is
your
typical
hydrograph
in
evidence
dated?
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
master
could
presumably,
taking
the
relevant
sets
of
hydrographic...
of
hydrographs
of
a
given
date,
the
ones
which
he
credited,
could
as
of
that
date
determine
what
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
thalweg
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
hydrographs
are
the
same
for
both
sides,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
a
question
of
an
expert
interpretation
of
those
hydrographs,
and
the
master
has
indicated
which
expert
he
believes.
unknown
speaker
experts.
unknown
speaker
he
believed
yours.
unknown
speaker
so
i
guess
you
wouldn't
object
to
having
it
drawn.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimmel,
does
the
live
thalweg
have
to
connect
with
the
dead
thalweg
at
each
end?
unknown
speaker
do
both
parties
agree,
then,
on
that--
unknown
speaker
--or
is
that
an
outstanding
legal
issue?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
maybe
you're
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
lower
thalweg
is
dead.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
act
admitting
mississippi
to
the
union
provides
that
the
boundary
shall
be
such
and
such,
or
the
act
admitting
louisiana,
i
dare
say
neither
of
those
acts
contemplated
an
interrupted
boundary.
unknown
speaker
then
how
could
it
subsequently
have
become
interrupted,
given
the
law
of
avulsion
and
accretion?
unknown
speaker
but
a
minute
ago
you
said
you
thought
the
boundary
didn't
have
to
be
continuous.
unknown
speaker
it
can't
be
if--
unknown
speaker
--no.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
all
that
louisiana
prayed
for
in
its
complaint?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kimmel,
isn't
discontinuous
boundary,
isn't
that
problem
just
inherent
in
the
concept
of
avulsion
on
the
one
hand--
unknown
speaker
--and
erosion
and
accretion
on
the
other?
unknown
speaker
because
when
there's
an
avulsion,
if
you
say,
if
the
law
is
the
line
is
fixed,
then
the
river's
running
someplace
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
enough
evidence
that
would
permit
the
master
without
taking
any
more
to
connect
the
live
thalweg
with
the
dead?
unknown
speaker
there
is
only
enough
evidence
to
permit
the
drawing
of
the
thalweg
as
of
given
dates
in
time
within
a
range
of
the
live
thalweg?
unknown
speaker
the
states
must
have
had
some
experience
with
this
in
the
past,
on
avulsions
and
accretions,
and
where
the
dead
thalweg
ends
and
the
live
thalweg
begins.
i
would
always...
i
would
think
that
would
be
not
a
new
problem.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kimmel
go
ahead
and
finish
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
kimmel,
does
the
concept
of
a
discontinuous
boundary,
which
apparently
makes
sense
to
my
brother
justice
white,
make
any
sense
to
you?
unknown
speaker
but
the
connection
between
the
live
and
the
dead
i
would
think
in
many
occasions
couldn't
possibly
be
completely
in
the
river.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
by
your
witness?
unknown
speaker
unless
you've
got
your
dead
thalweg
in
a
concrete-lined
canal,
the
point
at
which
the
live
thalweg
goes
into
the
dead
thalweg
is
going
to
migrate,
too,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
so
part
of
that
perpendicular
line
is
going
to
be...
may
very
well
be
going
over
dry
land.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
your
client,
of
course,
was
the
defendant
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
your
client,
the
state
of
mississippi,
was
the
defendant
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
did
you
file
any
kind
of
a
counterclaim
or
prayer
for
any
kind
of
relief,
affirmative
relief?
unknown
speaker
did
your
affirmative
defenses
pray
for
a
declaration
of
the
boundary?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you.
if
you're
connecting,
say,
the
north
end
of
the
dead
thalweg
here
with
the
southern
end
of
the
live
thalweg
in
the
area
in
dispute,
you
say
the
lines
are
there,
but
connecting
those
two
points
would
not
be
in
the
current
live
thalweg?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
it
has
migrated.
unknown
speaker
and
so
you
have...
the
boundary
line
would
be
traversing
a
section
of
the
stream
that
wouldn't
be
in
the
live
thalweg.
unknown
speaker
perpendicular?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
just
perpendicular
to
the
banks
there
or
east
and
west?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
yes.
