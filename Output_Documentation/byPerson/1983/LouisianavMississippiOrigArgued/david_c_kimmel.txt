mr.
david
c.
kimmel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
louisiana
and
mississippi
have
been
litigating
this
case
some
three
years
and
we've
agreed
on
a
lot
that
has
transpired
in
this
case.
the
two
states
as
well
as
mr.
dille,
the
riparian
landowner,
have
agreed
on
the
bottom
hole
location.
we
all
know
where
that
is
on
a
particular
map.
we
have
agreed
on
the
law
that
applies
to
this
particular
case.
and
the
two
states
as
well
as
mr.
dille
have
also
agreed
on
most
of
the
documents
that
have
been
introduced.
hydrographic
surveys
are
identical
for
both
states.
the
only
evidentiary
issue
is
the
interpretation
of
those
particular
documents
by
the
experts.
mississippi--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--in
terms
of
where
the
thalweg
is,
the
live
thalweg.
and
that
was
the
week-long
case
and
the
basis
of
it.
mississippi's
witness,
mr.
austin
smith,
his
analysis
of
those
particular
documents
was
completely
disregarded
by
the
special
master,
and
there
are
various
reasons
for
that.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
rejected,
your
honor,
rejected.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
he
considered
them.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
right.
mr.
austin
smith
did
not
use
or
utilize
any
navigational
aids
whatsoever,
including
the
lights
that
a
mariner
would
use
to
negotiate
this
particular
bend.
mr.
austin
smith
did
not
utilize
the
buoys
that
are
placed
in
the
river
in
this
particular
point
by
the
coast
guard.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1976
he
would
have
his
particular
vessel
running
over
the
buoys,
which
was
brought
out
in
the
special
master's
report.
mr.
smith
disregarded
a
developing
point
bar...
and
a
point
bar
is
a
land
mass
underneath
the
water
which
makes
a
very
shallow
area...
on
the
louisiana
side
directly
in
proximity
to
the
bottom
hole
location.
this
would
tend
to
throw
the
river
traffic
over
toward
mississippi,
which
is
what
the
special
master
found.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
breaking
down
a
tow
as
you
come
through
a
bend
means
that
you
are
to
point
your
tow
downstream.
as
you
come
through
the
bend,
a
mariner
will
see
lights,
and
just
above
the
bottom
hole
is
the
port
gibson
light.
that
is
referred
to
in
the
trade
as
a
passing
light.
we
introduced,
louisiana
did,
into
the
record
channel
reports
which
were
put
out
by
the
u.s.
coast
guard
every
week
from
soundings
taken
every
day,
a
recommended
navigation
course
through
this
bend.
what
did
the
channel
reports
say?
when
you
hit
that
passing
light
it
will
be
on
your
right;
maintain
200
yards
off
of
that
passing
light.
that
is
the
recommended
course
that
the
u.s.
coast
guard
tells
the
mariners
to
travel.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
no.
i'm
afraid
that's
the
layman
in
me,
your
honor,
saying
that.
it's
kept
on
the
starboard.
once
past
that
particular
light,
the
coast
guard
directs
the
mariners
to
shoot
for
giles
bend
cut-off
light,
which
is
on
the
mississippi
side,
and
that
is
referred
to
in
the
trade
as
a
crossing
light.
what
does
the
coast
guard
tell
the
mariner
to
do
at
that
point?
position
himself
in
some
years
200
years,
in
some
years
300
yards,
off
of
that
particular
light.
once
there,
he
is
to
break
down
and
go
towards
the
next
light,
which
will
then
be
on
the
louisiana
side,
and
that
is
the
cowpen
island
light.
he
uses
that
as
a
passing
light
and
he
continues
down
the
river.
that
is
the
coast
guard
recommended
sailing
line
through
this
particular
bend.
and
"breaking
down",
your
honor,
means
to
point
your
tow
downstream.
now,
mr.
smith
disregarded
these
channel
reports.
they
were
not
introduced.
he
had
a
problem
with
locking
in,
and
once
his
particular
thalweg
was
locked
in
i'm
assuming
it
would
run
up
on
the
shore
and
he
would
still
say
that's
the
way
it
would
have
to
go.
it
was
surprising
the
way
he
treated
the
channel
buoys,
especially
in
'76,
where
he
would
have
his
vessel
run
over
these
buoys.
he
says
they
were
off
course,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
only
because
they
would
not
be
charted
off
course,
and
they
show
up
on
the
hydrographic
surveys.
now,
as
far
as
louisiana's
witnesses
are
concerned,
mr.
hatley
harrison
used
his
analysis
of
the
hydrographic
surveys,
he
used
his
analysis
of
the
channel
reports,
he
used
his
analysis
of
the
flood
control
and
navigation
map
number
38,
which
is
put
out
by
the
mississippi
river
commission.
and
he
took
particular
note
of
the
navigational
aids
in
order
to
determine
his
particular
thalweg,
which
was
accepted
by
the
special
master.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
i
do,
your
honor.
as
far
as
mr.
harrison's
exhibits
in
the
record,
you
could
actually
determine
a
boundary.
but--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--for
each
year.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
for
'72
to
'82.
but
your
honor,
let
me
address
that
for
just
a
second.
my
point
is
why.
this
area
is
a
live
thalweg.
you
put
a
line
on
a
piece
of
paper
today;
tomorrow
it's
gone.
we
can
go
back
to
1972,
sure,
and
draw
a
particular
boundary.
the
day
after,
that
1972
boundary
that's
been
drawn
by
this
court
is
gone.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
quite
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
louisiana's
been
chasing
these
particular
problems
for
many
years,
your
honor.
and
louisiana--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--so
has
mississippi.
and
we
find
ourselves
in
the
position
of
really,
if
the
special
master
is
required
by
the
court
to
put
a
pencil
to
the
paper
and
draw
a
boundary,
louisiana
really
has
no
objection
to
that.
we
understand
what
the
problem
is
when
one
tries
to
draw
a
boundary
which
is
completely
ambulatory.
we
understand
that
problem.
most
of
the
cases,
if
not
all
of
them,
deal
with
the
dead
thalweg
issue,
where
you
can
set
a
boundary
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
it's
going
to
stay.
in
this
case
we
don't
have
that
at
all
for
any
year
and
we
won't
have
it
for
the
future,
because
that
boundary
is
going
to
move.
but
i
would
have
to
agree
with
your
honor
that
in
1982
if
we
actually
were
to
draw
a
boundary
we
would
then
know
approximately--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--yes,
sir,
that's
possibly
correct.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
the
only
real
issue
in
this
case...
and
i
doubt
whether
suit
would
have
ever
been
filed
had
it
not
been
for
the
ownership
of
this
particular
bottom
hole
of
this
well.
in
this
particular
area
mississippi
and
louisiana
have
gotten
along
fine.
we
haven't
had
any
boundary
problems.
this
suit
came
about...
the
genesis
of
this
suit
was
ownership.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
right.
but
the
ownership
of
the
well
is
the
underlying
issue
and,
as
the
special
master
determined,
since
he
finds
that
the
thalweg
has
not
moved
to
such
an
extent
to
place
the
well
in
mississippi,
in
his
opinion
it's
a
vain
and
useless
act
to
go
back
and
draw
the
boundaries.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
to
which
we
agree,
your
honor.
louisiana
again
finds
itself
in
a
position
of,
if
we
actually
have
a
boundary
drawn
on
a
piece
of
paper,
we
have
no
literal
objection
to
that.
frankly,
when
we
originally
filed
suit
we
sued
as
a
boundary
action.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
understanding,
of
course,
that
the
live
thalweg,
the
problems
incidental
in
establishing--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--no,
sir.
no,
sir,
absolutely
not.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
it
would
just
take
an
engineer
or
a
surveyor
in
plotting
a
particular
line
on
a
map.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
right,
or
depending--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--that's
right.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
right.
it
can
be
drawn.
it
can
be
done
and
it
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir,
the
hydrographic
surveys
are
dated,
yes,
sir,
for
each
individual
year.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir,
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir,
the
hydrographs--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--experts,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
we're
not
putting
up
a
strong
argument
over
that.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
in
my
opinion
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
no,
ma'am.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
if
there's
a
legal
issue
involved
in
that,
i
don't
know
what
it
is,
because
the
boundary...
in
my
opinion
the
boundary
does
not
have
to
connect.
mississippi
asserts
that
the
boundary
needs
to
be
continuous,
but
if
that
were
the
case
then
this
live
thalweg
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
in
the
river.
we
don't
have
a
continuous
boundary
with
mississippi
in
the
river
that's
ever
been
determined.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
no,
sir,
the
lower
thalweg
is
dead
as
a
result
of
a
cutoff.
this
is
a
cutoff,
your
honor,
and
what
has
happened
is
the
cutoff
area
dries
up
and
forms
a
dead
thalweg.
it
can
be
determined
by
engineers,
and
once
that's
been
done
that
is
set.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
no,
sir,
they
did
not
contemplate--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--it
is
not
technically
interrupted,
your
honor.
it's
just
that
it
has
not
been
determined.
as
i
mentioned,
louisiana
and
mississippi
have
a
common
boundary,
the
main
navigational
channel,
throughout
the
entire
stretch
of
the
mississippi
river.
but
it
has
not
been
determined.
the
two
states
have
talked
about
this
for
50
years
and
we've
tried
to
get
together
to
determine
a
boundary
and
put
it
to
a
piece
of
paper,
and
it
just
can't
be
done.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
it
does
not.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
well,
it
does
not
have
to
be
determined.
it
need
to
be
continuous.
it
needs
to
be
continuous
in
the
sense
that
you
can't
have
a
piece
of
boundary
that
has
disappeared.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
that's
true.
but
it
does
not
need
to
be
determined.
in
this
case
that
issue,
the
connection
of
that
boundary
to
the
dead
thalweg,
is
really
irrelevant
because
all
that
needs
to
be
determined
is
the
boundary
in
the
vicinity
of
the
well.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir.
we
asked
for
a
boundary
to
be
determined
in
that
particular
area,
disputed
area.
we
did
also
include
an
allegation
concerning
the
1964
thalweg,
and
the
reason
we
did
that
was
because
when
we
filed
the
suit
we
were
not
sure
whether
or
not
that
1964
dead
thalweg
would
be
an
issue
in
the
case.
as
it
turned
cut
through
discovery
and
depositions,
that
particular
thalweg
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case
and
the
entire
case
can
be
disposed
of
by
the
determination
of
a
live
boundary
in
the
vicinity
of
the
well.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
the
river
has
sinuosity
throughout
this
particular
area
that
has
driven
both
states
crazy
at
times
as
it
snakes
around
the
delta.
that's
a
problem,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
there
is
not.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and
louisiana
submits
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
the
connection
to
the
dead
thalweg
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case,
is
our
submission.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
it's
not...
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
new
problem,
especially
for
louisiana.
now,
i
don't
know,
mississippi
law
may
be
different
than
louisiana's--
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
--but
it
is
not
a
new
problem
and
the
state
is
familiar
with
the
dead
thalweg
issues.
our
only
point
is,
in
this
particular
case
for
the
court
to
dispose
of
this
case
and
accept
the
special
master's
report
the
connection
of
the
live
thalweg
to
the
dead
thalweg
is
totally
irrelevant
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
kimmel
the
only
way
it
makes
sense,
your
honor,
is
that
in
order...
to
connect
to
the
1964
thalweg
is
just
not
necessary.
all
this
court
needs
to
do
is
to
determine
the
live
thalweg
in
the
vicinity
of
that
particular
well.
there
is
no
reason...
the
states
of
louisiana
and
mississippi
are
not
fighting
over
any
connection
between
the
live
thalweg
and
the
dead
thalweg
of
this
river.
there
was
no
real
testimony
taken
in
that
regard.
and
all
the
two
states
tried
for
a
week
was
the
live
thalweg
issue
and
the
bottom
hole,
and
that
basically
is
louisiana's
contentions,
that
a
boundary
would
be
a
vain
and
useless
thing
for
the
court
to
draw,
and
also
that
the
special
master's
report,
his
acceptance
of
hatley
harrison's
testimony,
as
well
as
mr.
leo
odom's
testimony
and
his
determination
that
the
bottom
hole
of
this
well
has
remained
in
louisiana
for
all
the
years
in
dispute,
be
accepted
by
this
court.
