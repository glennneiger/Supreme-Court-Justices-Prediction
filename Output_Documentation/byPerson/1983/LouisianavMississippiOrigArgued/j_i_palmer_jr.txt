mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
louisiana
and
mississippi
once
again
disagree
about
the
location
of
our
common
boundary
in
the
mississippi
river.
in
this
litigation
we're
concerned
with
about
a
four-mile
stretch
of
the
river
which
is
situated
approximately
three
and
a
half
miles
north
of
the
natchez,
mississippi,
bridge.
this
case
is
remarkably
similar
to
the
one
that
you
decided
in
1966,
that
being
no.
14
original,
in
that,
while
the
facts
are
similar,
we
also
have
here
an
oil
well
which
was
drilled
in
1972
from
the
mississippi
side
of
the
river
and
your
decision
will
in
large
measure
determine,
among
several
issues,
in
which
state
this
oil
well
is
located.
mississippi
has
filed
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
master
in
this
case
and
they
focused
on
two
basic
areas:
one
is
the
manner
in
which
the
master
analyzed
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
fashioned
his
recommendations
to
you;
and
the
other
is
the
master's
refusal
to
draw
a
specific
boundary
by
geodetic
coordinates
for
the
entire
area
in
dispute
for
the
time
period
in
dispute,
which
is
essentially
1972
through
1982.
now,
as
the
master's
report
correctly
reflects,
your
honors,
louisiana
and
mississippi
both
recognize
that
the
law
of
the
thalweg
controls
here.
your
landmark
decision
of
iowa
versus
illinois
in
1892
announced
the
basic
law
of
the
case,
and
in
1906
when
you
decided
louisiana
versus
mississippi
in
the
first
instance
you
told
both
states
that
the
law
of
the
thalweg
controls.
so
to
that
extent
we
agree
on
the
law.
of
course,
the
thalweg
principle
has
two
basic
predicates,
one
being
the
principles
of
accretion
and
avulsion...
excuse
me,
accretion
and
erosion...
and
the
other
being
the
principles
of
avulsion.
now,
the
master
on
page
4
of
his
report
suggests
to
you
both
in
the
text
and
in
footnote
number
one
that
this
court
now
is
involved
only
with
the
principles
of
accretion
and
erosion
as
they
would
apply
to
the
so-called
live
thalweg
of
the
river
in
this
area.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
page
4,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
you'll
see
that
the
master
asserts
in
that
footnote
his
presumption
that
all
parties
agree
that
only
the
live
thalweg
is
at
issue
here
and
that,
he
says,
that
the
sole
evidence
before
this
court
relates
to
that
live
thalweg.
we
say
that
is
a
rather
bold
and
erroneous
statement
of
what's
in
the
record
before
you.
you'll
find,
first
of
all,
that
in
louisiana's
complaint,
your
honors,
she
alleges
that
the
boundary
that
we're
arguing
about
here
was
fixed
by
the
law
of
avulsion
as
a
result
of
the
1933
corps
of
engineers
cut-off
of
giles
bend,
which
is
just
to
the
south
and
constitutes
the
southern
half
of
this
boundary.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
we
say
to
the
court
that
the
thalweg
or
the
boundary
in
this
case
consists
in
the
upper
part
of
the
live
thalweg
and
in
the
lower
part
of
the
so-called
dead
thalweg
in
the
giles
bend
cut-off.
the
state
boundary
must
be
continuous,
and
in
this
particular
location,
your
honor,
the
thalweg
proceeds
on
its
live
course
until
it
hits
the
upper
terminus
of
the
dead
thalweg
which
was
caused
by
the
corps
of
engineers
cutoff.
and
that's
one
of
the
key
contentions
of
mississippi
here,
is
that
louisiana
not
only
asserted
that
the
law
of
avulsion
is
involved
here,
but
both
states
throughout
trial
introduced
ample
evidence
to
show
the
location
of
the
old
dead
thalweg
and
also
how
that
has
been
affected
by
the
westwardly
movement
of
the
river.
i
would
call
your
attention,
your
honor,
to
the
fact
that,
in
addition
to
the
assertions
of
both
states
in
the
pleadings,
the
very
second
exhibit
which
was
introduced
at
trial,
which
was
joint
exhibit
no.
1,
is
a
map
depicting
several
features
in
1971.
the
surface
location
of
the
well
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
river,
the
bottom
location,
and
the
specific
coordinates
and
position
of
the
1964
dead
thalweg
is
shown
on
that
very
exhibit
and
described
by
metes
and
bounds
coordinates.
additionally,
several
exhibits
introduced
by
louisiana
at
trial
show
that
1964
dead
thalweg.
now,
in
questioning
by
the
master
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
witness
at
that
time
said
that
for
the
purposes
of
that
present
testimony
that
depiction
of
the
'64
dead
thalweg
was
not
then
relevant.
but
counsel
for
louisiana
was
asked
about
those
drawings;
he
said
that
they
weren't
relevant
then,
but
might
become
so
later.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
the
implication
or
the
suggestion
of
the
statement
is
that
all
we
are
concerned
about
is
the
location
of
the
boundary
with
respect
to
that
well,
and
that
we
say
is
the
fundamental
problem
here.
we're
concerned
about
the
location
of
the
boundary
throughout
the
area
in
dispute.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
a
latitude
line
drawn
through
the
bottom
hole
location
in
an
east-west
direction
would
intersect
that
portion
of
this
boundary
which
is
live.
it
would
not
intersect
that
portion
of
the
boundary
which
is
part
of
the
dead
thalweg.
so
to
that
extent
that
is
a
correct
statement.
the
problem
we
have,
your
honor,
is
the
suggestion
of
the
footnote,
which
is
consistent
with
the
master's
report
to
you,
that
all
he
wants
to
do
is
look
at
that
one
point
on
the
boundary.
and
we
say
no,
because,
as
i
will
mention
in
a
moment,
the
ownership
of
this
well
is
but
one
of
the
results
of
this
case.
now--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
and
that
top
hole
is
located
in
the
state
of
mississippi
on
the
lands
of
our
co-defendants,
the
dille
family.
the
oil
well
was
drilled
deviationally,
in
an
angular
fashion,
under
the
river.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
so
the
bottom
hole
location
is
where
the
plug
is
at
the
bottom.
so
your
honors,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it
would
not
be
the
boundary
after
1982.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
there
are
several
consequences
of
this
case
in
addition
to--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--the
oil
well
ownership.
first
of
all,
as
we
have
said,
both
states
have
asked
that
the
boundary
be
drawn,
and
here
are
the
reasons
that
we
say
it's
extremely
important
here.
first
of
all,
louisiana
through
its
own
exhibits
in
evidence
has
shown
that
their
recommended
boundary
falls
well
to
the
west
of
the
1964
dead
thalweg.
now,
that
taken
to
be
true,
louisiana
herself
has
proved
that
she
has
lost
land
in
that
time
period
and
mississippi
has
gained
land
in
that
time
period.
therefore,
mississippi
has
acquired
additional
lands
over
which
to
assess
ad
valorem
taxes,
we
have
additional
lands
to
exert
our
police
jurisdiction
over.
louisiana
conversely,
having
lost
some
land,
has
those
drilling
units,
one
of
which
surrounds
this
oil
well,
diminished
in
scope.
and
if
we
sit
here
and
let
louisiana
continue
to
claim
out
to
a
dead
thalweg
which
she
herself
proves
doesn't
exist
any
more,
you're
talking
about
giving
a
state
more
land
than
even
she
has
said
she's
entitled
to.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
it's
not
there,
your
honor.
but
let
me
point
out--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--i
don't,
and
that
would
only
be
determined
through
the
addition
of
more
testimony.
let
me
point
out
something,
though,
your
honor.
the
master
in
his
suggestions
to
you
as
a
basis
for
not
drawing
that
line
used
your
precedent,
the
old
icc
case
back
in
1911
or
thereabouts.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
okay.
there
are
two
more:
one,
this
court
has
in
the
past,
and
certainly
will
in
the
future
probably,
entertained
petitions
for
the
entry
of
a
supplemental
decree.
in
the
event
that
the
evidence
shows
in
the
future
that
the
boundary
has
moved
radically
to
the
west,
then
of
course
mississippi
would
come
before
you
and
ask
for
the
entry
of
a
supplemental
decree.
the
case
would
be
reopened,
additional
facts
would
be
presented.
then
you
would
have
another
determination
as
of
the
date
of
the
conclusion
of
that
supplemental
hearing.
now,
your
honor,
if
we're
not
going
to
draw
a
boundary
here,
then
at
that
later
time
we
start
all
over
again.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
you
can
draw
the
metes
and
bounds
boundary
for
every
year
for
which
you
have
evidence
of
its
location
after--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it's
magic
in
the
sense
that
we're
determining
not
only
the
rights
between
the
states,
but
you
must
remember
there
are
private
defendants
in
this
litigation,
and
to
that
extent
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
action
that
precipitated
this
very
lawsuit,
the
dille
family
has
complained
of
possible
drainage
of
the
oil
from
their
land.
now,
that's
their
private
concern.
that's
not
the
concern
of
the
state.
but
your
honors,
unless
they
can
prove
where
that
boundary
is
in
this
time
frame,
they
cannot
make
their
drainage
case.
so
they're
sitting
there,
if
this
court
does
not
draw
the
boundary,
with
a
pending
case
before
a
lower
federal
court
and
they're
being
told:
okay,
prove
your
boundary...
prove
your
drainage
case.
they
can't
prove
it.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that
is
still
basically
a
boundary
decision,
your
honor,
and
louisiana
got
this
case
removed
to
here
because
they
say
this
is
the
only
forum
for
determining
that
boundary.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
it
is
live
at
that
one
point,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
one
point
on
their
property
boundary,
your
honor.
but
their
boundary
is
commensurate
with
the
louisiana
boundary
for
the
entirety
of
their
ownership.
so
they
get
one
point
on
their
boundary
line,
but
the
rest
of
their
boundary
is
left
indeterminate.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
basically
as
to
that
question,
that
if
this
court
does
not
draw
that
boundary
and
the
private
defendants
are
remanded
to
the
lower
court
to
prove
their
drainage
case
and
they
can't
do
it,
you
have
the
classic
situation
like
the
icc
case.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
because
they
attempted
to
do
that
and
louisiana
said:
no,
you
can't
do
it
at
the
lower
federal
level.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
they
did.
we're
here.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
which
is
exactly
what
we
argued
in
our
motion
in
opposition.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
they
would
have
had
to
go
forward
or
be
out
of
court.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
of
course,
this
court
had
that
very
same
question
posed
to
you
in
no.
92
original,
arkansas
versus
mississippi,
when
arkansas
was
on
the
courthouse
doorsteps
going
to
trial
and
backed
up
and
said:
wait
a
minute,
that's
not
the
right
forum
to
determine
a
boundary
dispute.
and
you
entertained
their
motion
for
leave
to
file.
they
did
file
suit.
the
master
suggests
that
if
this
oil
well
weren't
involved
in
this
suit
you
wouldn't
have
let
anybody
do
it.
but
it's
already
happened
in
no.
92.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
the
only
problem--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
only
problem
with
that
is
that
the
owner
on
the
mississippi
side
is
the
dille
family.
the
owner
on
the
louisiana
side
is
the
state
of
louisiana.
now,
if
they
will
concede
to
try
their
boundary
case
in
a
lower
federal
court
against
a
citizen
of
another
state,
okay.
but
they
wouldn't
do
that
here,
so
they
removed
it
to
this
court.
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
which
the
state
owns
riparian
lands.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
no,
sir,
and
we
suggested
to
you
originally
not
to
grant
leave
for
that
very
reason.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
we
simply
say
that,
since
the
court
has
taken
the
case,
we've
tried
it,
the
evidence
is
before
the
court,
the
master
has
labored
diligently
with
several
thousand
words
to
describe
one
picture,
why
not
just
have
him
put
his
line
on
those
hydrographs?
a
suggestion
has
been
made
by
the
master
even
before
today
that,
as
in
the
last
louisiana
case,
no.
14,
that
someone
should
be
able
to
just
read
the
report
and
determine
from
his
reading
where
the
boundary
is.
unfortunately,
in
that
latter
case,
your
honors,
if
you'll
refer
to
the
master's
report
you'll
see
there
were
no
hydrographs
in
that
case
for
any
of
the
years
in
dispute.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
correct.
your
honor,
we
are
arguing
about
'72
to
'82,
not
anything
after
'82.
we're
saying
that
there
are
material
consequences
of
this
determination
for
that
time
period,
regardless
of
what
happens--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--we're
suggesting
that
there
is
a
metes
and
bounds
description
for
every
year
for
which
there
is
proof
upon
which
a
boundary
could
be
determined.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
asked
that
you
do
what
the
master
did
in
no.
14
and
simply
have
him
draw
it
for
every
year.
that
was
done
there.
your
own
decree
recites
the
metes
and
bounds
description
of
the
state
boundary
for
about
a
ten-year
period
at
the
end
of
the
case.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
the
same
thing,
and
yet
the
court
is
being
asked
to
depart
from
all
of
that
and
to
do
what
you've
never
done
before
and
have
a
boundary
case
in
which
you
don't
determine
a
boundary,
you
just
determine
one
point
on
it
and
say,
well,
this
is...
louisiana
owns
the
oil
well,
forget
about
it
and
go
home.
now,
it
would
be
like
in
92
original,
arkansas
versus
mississippi,
just
telling
arkansas:
well,
you
don't
own
this
little
piece
of
land,
but
we're
not
going
to
draw
the
boundary,
so
forget
about
it.
we
say
there
are
other
consequences
besides
that.
of
course,
we
have
spent
the
bulk
of
those
exceptions,
your
honors,
as
you
have
seen,
developing
our
factual
contentions.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
in
nebraska
versus
iowa
this
court
plainly
said
that
when
you're
talking
about
a
boundary
and
the
law
of
avulsion,
which
is
what
you're
talking
about
with
that
dead
thalweg,
that
that
thalweg
remains
fixed
unless
and
until
the
river
comes
back
and
reoccupies
it.
and
we've
shown
that
this
has
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
better
than
what's
recommended,
to
the
extent
that
we
at
least
have
a
portrayal
of
the
southern
part
of
those
drilling
units
on
the
louisiana
side.
but
you
then
still
leave
a
floating
line
north
of
that
point,
your
honor.
if
the
master
is
going
to
determine
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
dead
and
the
live
thalwegs
and
another
point
on
the
live
boundary,
we
still
don't
see
the
great
difficulty
in
his
going
ahead
and
just
simply
drawing
his
line
that
he
described
to
you
in
the
book
and
having
some
competent
surveyor
go
pick
the
coordinates
off
of
it.
the
difficulty
is
just
not
there.
we
just
don't
understand--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it
could.
i
go
back
again
to
what
this
court
has
done
before
in
these
types
of
cases
in
which
you
have
a
completed
time
span
for
the
controversy.
you
still
have
not
refused
to
give
the
states
the
portrayal
of
the
boundary
that
was
in
issue.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
there
is
no
claim
as
between
the
two
states
except
as
they
bear
directly
on
taxation
of
those--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--there's
been
no
claim
made
of
that.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
okay.
i
think
the
basic
contention
would
be,
your
honor,
where
the
jurisdictions
of
the
two
states
go--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--well,
as
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
it
certainly
would
affect
our
exercise
of
police
power.
for
instance--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
state
of
mississippi
were
to
do
today
what
it
has
not
done
and
establish
drilling
units
on
the
mississippi
side
of
that
boundary,
then
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
do
we
draw
it
consistent
with
the
louisiana
1964
line
or
do
we
say,
no,
the
master
describes
a
certain
indefinite
line
out
in
the
river,
so
we're
going
to
use
that
as
the
western
terminus
of
our
drilling
units?
you're
going
to
have
an
obvious
overlap,
because
there
will
be
no
fixing
of
the
boundary.
all
those
leases
which
are
attached
to
the
complaint
show
the--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
my
point
has
been
that
in
the
past
this
court
has
not
required
some
major
controversy
over
and
beyond
the
states'
sovereignty
over
these
lands
as
a
predicate
for
granting
leave
to
determine
a
boundary.
you
certainly
haven't
done
it
in
the
past,
and
after
this
case
was
filed
again
you
didn't
require
that
in
92.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that
certainly
has--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--that
certainly
has
been
what
you
have
done
in
the
past,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
and
if
the
court
wants
to
depart
from
that,
so
be
it.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
require
that
the
states
with
some
definition
describe
this
disputed
area
in
terms
of
miles
or
land
size
or
whatever.
but
i'm
just
saying
that
in
the
past
there
has
been
no
more
predicate
other
than
to
say,
we
don't
agree
where
our
boundary
is,
we
want
this
court
to
use
its
original
jurisdiction
to
fix
it,
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may.
that's
what
has
been
done
before.
we're
asking
you
to
do
that
now,
and
yet
we're
getting
into
a
flip-flop
situation
where
the
master
is
saying:
forget
about
all
that;
we'll
just
tell
you
where
the
bottom
hole
is
and
you
don't
worry
about
the
location
of
your
boundary.
we
say
the
consequences
are
far
too
great
just
to
go
off
on
that,
particularly
when
you've
got
it
all
done
before
you,
the
evidence
is
all
in.
and
on
the
form
of
the
evidence,
i'm
not
going
to
belabor
in
great
detail
what
we
have
set
out
in
detail
in
our
report
to
you.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
as
i
recall,
from
bits
of
the
testimony,
your
honor,
in
one
or
two
years
the
mississippi
witness
contended
the
boundary
moved
as
much
as
200
feet
or
thereabouts.
i
think
the
record
will
substantiate
that
there
was
movement
of
at
least
that
much.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
that
that's
the
maximum.
i
know
that
historically
there
have
been
movements
of
the
banks
of
over
2,000
feet
a
year.
that's
from
my
personal
knowledge.
and
that
was
testified
to
in
this
case
about
the
massive
movement--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it
may
well
not,
but
to
suspect
that
that
time
of
movement
of
the
top
bank
would
cause
no
movement
of
the
thalweg
we
think
is
unreasonable.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
but
to
the
point
of
the
basic
evidentiary
problems
here,
the
thalweg
doctrine
is
based
on
navigation.
the
rule
there
is
where
does
downstream
traffic
go.
we're
talking
about
quarter
mile
long
tows,
not
rowboats
and
sailboats,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
master's
conclusions
are
erroneous
in
light
of
the
evidence,
and
particularly
in
light
of
the
experience
of
the
witnesses
that
testified.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
several
points
that
the
court
very
perceptively
raised
just
a
moment
ago.
first
of
all,
regarding
the
connection
between
the
live
and
the
dead
thalweg.
i
addressed
that
initially
and
pointed
out
to
the
court,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
indeed
ample
evidence
in
this
record
of
where
that
dead
thalweg
is.
it
is
described
by
metes
and
bounds
coordinates
on
the
very
second
exhibit
that
was
even
introduced
at
trial.
mr.
austin
smith,
the
expert
for
mississippi,
described
in
detail
how
a
continuous
state
boundary,
which
must
not
have
a
hiatus,
is
connected
between
live
and
dead
thalwegs,
and
the
exhibits
are
there
for
this
court
to
use.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
your
honor,
the
upper
terminus
of
a
dead
thalweg
is
fixed
at
a
point
in
time,
generally,
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court,
when
there
is
no
flow
in
that
dead
channel.
at
that
point
it's
fixed
geodetically.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
now,
there
is
an
accepted
engineering
technique
for
connecting
that
upper
terminus
to
the
migrating
live
terminus.
that's
fully
discussed
in
the
record
by
mr.
smith.
you
draw
a
perpendicular
line
from
the
live
thalweg
to
the
upper
terminus
of
the
dead.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that
was
done
here
in
this
case.
it's
even
shown
in
the
louisiana--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it
was
discussed
by
our
witness.
but
your
honor,
the
very
exhibits
to
louisiana's
complaint
show
the
pictorial
of
their
drilling
units,
and
they're
key
to
the
dead
thalweg.
it's
there
in
black
and
white.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
the
point
of
connection
between
the
live
and
the
dead
is
going
to
be
fixed.
but
the
connection
between
the
live
thalweg
and
that
perpendicular
line
connecting
it
to
the
dead
will
migrate,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that's
the
way
it's
done.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
it
could,
but
that
would
be
highly
unlikely,
your
honor.
quickly,
the--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
set
up
our
defenses
as
affirmative
defenses
and
did
not
file
a
counterclaim
in
this
case,
as
we
did
in
no.
92.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
the
contentions
of
our
expert
witness,
we've
set
those
out
in
our
exceptions
and
the
bottom
line
is
this:
we
put
on
a
witness
who
has
now
spent
over
50
years
of
work
in
that
river,
over
40
of
which
was
in
the
federal
service
with
the
u.s.
corps
of
engineers,
10
of
which
was
as
chief
of
the
navigation
and
mapping
branch
of
the
corps
of
engineers
mississippi
river
commission.
to
assert
in
the
face
of
a
450-page
record...
and
i
won't
cite
all
the
times
he
did
discuss
it...
that
he
didn't
use
navigational
aids
is
ludicrous.
and
second,
if
you'll
just
look
at
the
october
1976
and
the
may
1977
hydrographs,
you'll
see
why
the
line
was
deliberately
drawn
through
some
off-station
buoys.
the
'77
hydrograph
shows
the
proper
location
of
those
buoys
and
louisiana's
own
expert
witness
drew
his
so-called
geological
thalweg,
which
is
through
the
deepest
part
of
the
channels,
right
through
those
same
buoys.
you
don't
put
a
shallow
water
buoy
in
deep
water.
they're
off
station
and
the
witness
testified
to
that.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you're
absolutely
right,
if
this
court
does
not
draw
a
boundary
you
have
no
more
than
a
quiet
title
action.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that's
correct,
because
by
definition
the
terminus
of
the
southern
end
would
be
the
live
thalweg.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
that's
why,
as
was
testified
to
at
trial,
the
accepted
technique
is
to
draw
the
perpendicular
line
through
the
live
thalweg.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
because
on
equitable
principles--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--perpendicular
to
the
live
thalweg.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
as
mr.
smith
testified--
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
--it
depends
on
where
the
upper
end
of
the
dead
thalweg
is,
but
you
could,
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
the
point
is
that
if
you
didn't
draw
it
perpendicularly
you
would
be
unfairly
favoring
one
state
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
i.
palmer,
jr.
the
standard
of
review
in
this
case,
as
the
court
well
knows,
is
de
novo.
