unknown
speaker
ms.
motz,
at
some
point
in
your
argument
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
standing
question?
unknown
speaker
whenever
you
plan
to
get
to
it
is
fine.
i
was
hoping
you
would
cover
something
about
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
maryland
court
of
appeals'
ruling
on
standing
was
based
on
maryland
law
or
on
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
they
certainly
cited
mostly
federal
cases.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question
on
standing?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
right
on
standing,
that
there
is
no
jus
tertii,
whatever
you
call
it,
standing,
what
shall
we
do
with
the
case?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
if
we
agree
with
on
jus
tertii
standing.
unknown
speaker
so,
really
there
is
no
difference
in
your
view
between
the
standing
issue
and
the
merits
issue
on
the
overbreadth
question?
unknown
speaker
ms.
motz,
may
i
ask
you
whether
it
is
your
position
now
that
there
are...
are
there
any
limits
in
your
view
on
the
circumstances
in
which
the
exemption
is
available
to
a
charity?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
what
that
means,
effectively
prevent
from
raising
contributions?
does
it
mean
they
couldn't
raise
any
contributions
or
they
would
raise
less
money
without
the
limitation?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
they
can
show
that
by
exceeding
the
limit
they
would
raise
an
extra
dollar
than
if
they
didn't
have
the
25
percent
they
would
be
exempt.
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
these
exemptions
were
granted
before
this
lawsuit
was
filed?
unknown
speaker
how
many
before
this
lawsuit
was
filed?
unknown
speaker
so
those
are
all
post-litigation
exemptions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
the
regulations
are
consistent
with
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
your
highest
court?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
satisfied
with
so-called
narrow
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
guess
you
have
to
be.
unknown
speaker
ms.
motz,
i
would
like
to
ask
question
about
the
statute
also.
on
page
eight
of
brief,
you
say
there
is
no
limit
whatever
on
administrative
expenses.
unknown
speaker
will
you
tell
me
about
some
of
normal
administrative
expenses.
what
about
salaries
personnel
who
work
in
the
headquarters,
say,
of
the
united
fund?
unknown
speaker
nor
is
rent?
unknown
speaker
nor
is
travel
expense
of
executives?
unknown
speaker
what
is
touched?
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
some
illustration?
printing
is
not
included.
unknown
speaker
what
about
radio?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
organization
just
hired
a
fundraiser
and
the
fundraiser
charges
a
fee
or
percentage?
i
suppose
that
would
be
covered.
unknown
speaker
what
about
expense
accounts
of
the
staff?
unknown
speaker
the
expense
accounts.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
unlimited
expense
accounts--
unknown
speaker
--where
you
raise
money
for
somebody
and
you
don't
charge
any
fee,
but
your
expense
accounts
run
about
twice
what
you
raise?
unknown
speaker
you
evidently
don't
have
some
of
the
sharp
ones
around
here
then.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
in
this
case
there
was
a
specific
case
for
an
exemption
which
was
denied
and
then
this
suit
is
brought.
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
state's
interest
in
enforcing
this
statute
is
sufficient
to
override
whatever
first
amendment
interest
there
is
here.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
i
said,
let's
assume,
let's
assume,
assume
there
is
no
overbreadth
issue
whatsoever,
just
that
this
charity
says
this
is
what
it
does
to
me.
and,
i
would
suppose
your
position
has
to
be
that
the
state's
interest
in
that
is
sufficient
to
warrant
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
that...
if
the
statute
is
applied
to
some
advocacy
groups
would
be
unconstitutional
i
take
it
you
are
saying
it
might
be.
unknown
speaker
if
an
exemption
were
forbidden
or
if
there
was
a
prosecution
for
raising
money
without
a
permit
of
some
advocacy
organizations,
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not...
i
take
it
then
we
should
judge
the
case
as
though
that
were
the
case,
unless
you
want
to
take
a
position
on
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
you
can
imagine
some
advocacy
groups
which
would...
to
which
the
statute
could
not
be
applied
constitutionally.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
i
will
take
that.
i
will
take
that.
an
advocacy
group
denied
the
exemption
and
without
the
permit
they
cannot
raise
money.
you
would
say
that
in
some
circumstances
the
statute
could
not
be
applied.
unknown
speaker
on
your
submission
then
we
must
assume
that
in
some
circumstances
the
statute
could
not
be
constitutionally
applied.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
avoid
the
overbreadth
argument
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
your
court
agree
with
your
assessment?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
don't
they
know
more
about
the
possibilities
in
the
great
state
of
maryland
than
we
do?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
author
of
broadrick
and
the
author
of
schaumburg
disagree
with
one
another,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
that
is
based
on
something
you
said
earlier?
you
said
"complete
exemption".
when
they
get
the
exemption
and
then
they
thereafter
solicit,
are
they
required
by
the
terms
of
the
exemption
to
disclose
the
fact
that
over...
so
it
is
really
not
a
complete
exemption.
unknown
speaker
it
is
subject
to
disclosure.
unknown
speaker
and,
i
take
it
the
thought
behind
the
disclosure
requirement
is
that
would
avoid
any
danger
of
fraudulent--
unknown
speaker
--know
what
was
happening.
unknown
speaker
why
would
not
such
a
blanket
requirement
of
disclosure,
whenever
over
25
percent
is
used
for
administrative
expenses,
why
would
that
not
adequately
serve
the
state's
interest
in
avoiding
fraud?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
it
doesn't
do
the
trick?
maybe
it
doesn't
prevent
people
from
buying
cigarettes,
but
they
are
not
being
defrauded
if
they
know
the
risks
involved
in
the
purchase.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
your
only
interest,
to
avoid
the
risk
of
fraud
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
except
in
the
opinion
of
your
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
overbreadth
argument
must
always
be
supported
by
evidence
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
do
we
say...
if
we
agree
with
you,
what
do
we
say
about
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
about
the
substantiality
of
the
overbreadth?
you
say
it
is
wrong
because
we
know
more
about...
we
have
got
better
judicial
notice
than
they
have.
unknown
speaker
now,
going
back
to
your
statement
that
the
states
do
have
the
power
to
regulate,
constitutional
power--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
mean
by
that
if
the
states...
at
least
50
percent
of
the
money
must
go
to
the
charitable
organization...
that
the
expenses
can't
exceed
50
percent
that
might
be
satisfactory?
unknown
speaker
how
about
75--
unknown
speaker
--wait
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
if
25
percent
must
go
to
the
principal,
that
expenses
can't
exceed
75
percent?
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
even
90?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
what
if
a
legislature
were
to
say
that
our
statute
is
not
only
designed
to
prevent
fraud,
but
we
think
it
is
against
public
policy
for
charitable
solicitors
to
make
90
percent
of
what
they
take.
so,
even
if
they
completely
disclose
it,
we
are
not
going
to
let
them
operate
in
maryland.
do
you
think
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
intrusive?
is
there
something
in
the
constitution
that
says
an
ordinance
can't
be
intrusive?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
seem
to
insist
that
only
fraud
can
be
a
permissible
motive,
legislative
motive,
for
a
statute
like
this.
certainly
a
state
can
regulate
the
fees
charged
by
employment
agencies,
can
it
not,
regardless
of
how
much
the
employment
agency
discloses?
it
can
say,
whatever
you
disclose,
you
still
can't
collect
a
referral
fee
of
more
than
10
percent.
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
but,
what
if
a
state
said
that
we
think
literary
agents
are
just
getting
too
much
money
from
authors,
so
we
are
going
to
forbid
any
literary
agent
from
collecting
more
than
10
percent
by
way
of
a
commission
from
an
author's
royalties
on
a
book?
now,
supposing
you
could
make
all
the
showing
that
the
agent
had
been
getting
kind
of
grabby,
the
same
sort
of
thing
you
make
for
an
employment
agency,
do
you
think
there
is
anything
wrong
under
the
constitution
with
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
statutes
conceivably
could
be
challenged.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
challenges?
unknown
speaker
if
that
analysis
is
true,
the
cases
of
holding
of
regulation
on
employment
agency
fees
must
be
wrong
if
it
is
just
a
market
place
analysis.
unknown
speaker
maryland
wasn't
attempting
to
tell
them
how
to
do
it.
it
wasn't
addressing
specific
methods
as
in
schaumburg.
but,
going
back
to
your
statement
that
the
state
has
a
constitutional
authority
to
regulate,
could
you
give
some
examples
of
what
you
think
would
be
reasonable
or
constitutional
regulations?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
suppose
maryland
has
provided
in
its
statute
that
during
the
period
of
the
solicitation
the
soliciting
organization
and
the
ultimate
beneficiary
must
publish
once
a
week
in
the
local
newspaper
the
record
of
the
last
previous
solicitation
as
to
how
much
it
cost
to
raise
the
money,
how
much
of
it
was
going
to
the
charitable
organization
and
how
much
was
going
to
the
promoters.
would
that
be
a
valid
regulation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
people
being
solicited
would
understand
where
their
money
was
going.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
publication
would
you
have
to
give?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
on
your
statement...
you
have
just
said
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
to
compel
them
to
make
a
public
disclosure.
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
how
often
and
how
detailed?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
the
statute
compels
the
organization
to
disclose
it.
you
said
you
agreed
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
often,
once
every
thousand
years?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
to
the
public.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
they
could
be
compelled
to
report
to
the
public
not
some
agency.
unknown
speaker
in
how
much
detail?
for
example,
unlimited
expense
accounts,
would
that
be
included?
unknown
speaker
you
really
didn't
mean
what
you
said,
to
give
it
to
the
public,
did
you?
you
meant
to
give
it
to
the
public
on
your
terms.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
look
at
the
new
york
statute?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
look
at
the
new
york
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
how
you
ever
got
to
the
indiana
one.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
oh
!
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
what
about
the
exemptions
that
are
allowed
under
the
maryland
statute.
isn't
that
a
substantial
difference?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
say
the
maryland
statute
would
be
fine
under
schaumburg
if
the
exemption
provision
set
forth
some
standards.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
unknown
speaker
if
your
position
is
the
statute
is
overbroad
and
the
exemption
doesn't
help,
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
that
even
if
you
had
applied
for
an
exemption
and
you
had
received
the
exemption
and
you
were
able
to
solicit
on
behalf
of
this
organization,
you
would
still
have
this
lawsuit
that
you
would
be
able
to
maintain?
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
make
your
overbreadth
attack
on
this
statute
even
if
you
had
applied
for
an
exemption
and
obtained
an
exemption,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
ask
for
an
exemption
then?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
wouldn't
have
lost
your
right
to
challenge
it.
unknown
speaker
you
might
have
been
able
to
solicit
in
the
meantime.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
all
that,
but
it
does
not
explain
to
me
why
you
wouldn't
have
applied
for
the
exemption.
maybe
you
don't
have
to,
but
i
am
just
curious.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
may
i
ask
a
question?
unknown
speaker
the
stipulation
states
that
the
fraternal
order
of
police
that
you
represent
is
engaged
in
advocating
causes.
i
am
generally
familiar
with
the
orders
of
police
and
in
my
state
of
virginia
they
serve
their
useful
purpose.
tell
me
specifically
what
causes
your
client--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
cause
is
to
improve
employment
conditions
of
police?
unknown
speaker
as
a
public
relations
program?
unknown
speaker
as
a
public
relations
program?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
put
on,
by
radio,
television,
newspaper
ads,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg,
are
any
of
the
funds
used
directly
to
benefit
aged
police
or
police
whose
disability
benefits
are
not
adequate
to
take
care
of
them?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
this.
do
you
have
to
file
any
report
at
all
of
how
the
money
is
expended?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
about
maryland
law.
unknown
speaker
does
maryland
law
require
the
filing
of
any
report
to
anyone?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
know
what
maryland
law
provides?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
this
statute.
i
am
thinking,
for
example,
about
reports
that
corporations
have
to
file,
certain
corporations
that
have
listed
stock,
that
disclose
their
assets
and
liabilities
and
their
income
each
year
and
a
vast
amount
of
information.
i
was
wondering
whether,
in
maryland,
for
example,
that
is
a
stated
issue,
any
report
of
any
kind
is
required
to
be
filed
by
a
charitable
organization?
is
the
answer
no?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
would
you
object
to
that?
unknown
speaker
and,
do
you
know,
for
example,
what
percentage
of
the
funds
raised
by
your
client
go
to
the
direct
benefit
of
police
who
are
needy
or
otherwise
need
the
money?
unknown
speaker
i
am
thinking
about
the
distinction
between
advocating
causes
and
providing
relief
for
needy
policemen.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
not
able
to
tell
us
with
any
figures
or
even
with
any
rough
estimates
as
to
what
extent
this
organization
is
a
cause
advocacy
organization?
i
am
talking
now
in
terms
of
percent
of
money
raised.
unknown
speaker
if
you
don't
know,
just
say
so.
unknown
speaker
mr.
goldberg--
unknown
speaker
--the
one
thing
clear
is
that
your
client
is
not
a
charitable
organization.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not?
