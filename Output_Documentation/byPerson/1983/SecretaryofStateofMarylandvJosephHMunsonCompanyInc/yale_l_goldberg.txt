mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
with
the
court's
permission:
first,
if
i
may,
let
me
say
that
notwithstanding
the
remarks
contained
in
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
petitioner,
neither
the
respondent
nor
any
of
the
amici
suggests
to
this
honorable
court
or
to
anyone
else
that
the
state
doesn't
have
a
right
to
regulate
in
this
area
because
truly,
surely
it
does.
nor
shall
i
come
before
you
today
to
reargue
schaumburg
case.
i
don't
think
it
needs
rearguing.
i
think
your
findings
in
the
schaumburg
case
were
quite
clear.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
if
you
look
at
statute
in
the
schaumburg
case,
that
is
that
portion
which
sets
up
in
that
case
75
percent
formula,
and
in
case
of
the
state
of
maryland,
the
25
exemption,
i
think
you
will
find
them
substantially
the
same.
you
will
find
some
allocations
of
costs
slightly
different,
but
their
intrusiveness
on
first
amendment
rights
are
almost
equal
and
i
say
the
word
"almost",
because
it
is
my
contention
that
the
maryland
statute
is
not,
in
fact,
less
intrusive
of
first
amendment
rights,
but,
in
fact,
more
intrusive
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
no,
no,
indeed,
mr.
chief--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--i
am
sorry,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
respectfully
i
would
suggest
that
any
percentage,
any,
whether
the
percentage
were
25,
50,
75
or--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--even
90,
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
raise
a
point
that
was
raised
in
the
court
below
when
it
was
asked
of
me
suppose
90
percent
was
the
determinative
factor?
and,
i
said
to
the
court
below,
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
that
any
percentage
that
takes
away
the
right
of
the
public
to
makes
it
own
decision
whether
or
not
to
contribute
to
a
particular
organization
or
cause
or
whatever
advocacy
group,
such
a
percentage
would
be
invalid,
period.
why
do
i
say
that?
because
the
purpose
of
these
statutes,
all
of
them,
the
schaumburg
statute,
by
the
evidence
of
counsel
here
this
morning,
this
statute,
they
are
designed
to
help
prevent
fraud.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
just
as
intrusive,
and
with
your
permission,
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
like
to
tell
you
why.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
well,
no,
your
honor,
but
if
it
is,
it
has
to
be
minimally
intrusive
of
a
first
amendment
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
and,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
an
example
of
what
i
am
talking
about.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
if
this
year,
as
an
example,
the
particular
charity
succeeded
in
raising
$10,000
for
a
particular
advocacy
group
and
they
did
it
right
within
the
25
percent
limitation
that
was
provided
by
the
maryland
statute
and
everybody
was
happy,
and
the
next
year
they
decided,
well,
we
want
to
bring
our
message
across
to
a
greater
number
of
people,
we
want
to
raise
more
money,
and
instead
of
using
the
mail
as
we
had
done
before
and
perhaps
a
few
speeches
around
town...
the
super
bowl
is
coming
up
and
we
want
to
take
some
time
and
buy
some
advertisement
and
we
want
to
raise
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
well,
our
cost
on
there
looks
like
is
going
to
be
about
$750,000.
well,
we
will
pay
the
$750,000
because
we
are
going
to
raise
$250,000.
so,
as
a
result,
we
have
gone
far
beyond
the
maryland
statute,
but
what
we
haven't
done,
your
honor,
is
committed
any
fraud.
and,
there
is
no
implication
of
fraud.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
that
is
so,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
applicable
in
the
area
in
first
amendment
and
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
conceivably
could
be
challenged,
yes.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
frankly,
your
honor,
would
feel
that
perhaps
the
outcome
of
the
statute,
i
think,
would
be
declared
perhaps
unconstitutional
as
an
unjustified
intrusion
into
the
right
to
deal
freely
in
business
in
the
absence
of
any
suggestion
of
fraud
or
wrongdoing.
we
have
a
market
place
system
here
in
our
society--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--your
honor,
i
don't
stand
before
this
court
and
suggest
that
i
would
be
a
sage
in
suggesting
that
i
would
agree
or
disagree
with
all
past
holdings
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
and
hope
that
what
my
position
is
with
respect
to
a
particular
issue
is
the
correct
one.
i
address
myself
to
those
issues
this
morning
that
have
to
do
with
a
statute
which
is
baldly
on
its
face
overly
broad
and
that
it
reaches
out
and
sweeps
in
organizations
who
have
a
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
presentation.
we
are
dealing
with
a
percentage
statute
and
i
know
the
statement
that
i
have
made
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
statement
is
a
rather
strong
one,
but,
nonetheless,
when
you
are
talking
about
first
amendment
rights,
i
think
it
has
been
the
tradition
of
this
court
to
be
very,
very
strong
in
its
protection
of
those
rights.
i
would
suggest
that
not
only
is
the
statute
in
maryland
stronger
than
that...
stronger
in
the
sense
that
it
violates
first
amendment
rights
to
a
greater
extent.
if
you
compare
the
village
of
schaumburg
statute,
it
only
really
related
to
door-to-door
solicitations,
though
the
court
didn't
rest
its
opinion
on
the
door-to-door
permit
requirement.
in
the
maryland
statute,
may
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
solicitation
is
any
form
of
solicitation,
whether
it
be
by
radio
broadcast,
whether
it
be
by
telephone,
whether
it
be
by
mail
or
whatever
media--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--certainly,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
statute
here
before
me,
but
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
the
statute
which
is
in
effect
in
indiana
that
i
had
occasion
to
take
a
look
at
which
is
a
very
strict
disclosure
statute
which
requires
an
organization
to
present
a
statement
of
its
financial
affairs
in
connection
with
all
contributions
made
to
it.
i
would
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
this
court
stated
in
its
schaumburg
decision
there
are
many,
many,
very,
very
strong
penal
statutes
that
can
be
drawn,
and
some
have
been
drawn
already,
which
deal
with
fraud.
if
fraud
is
the
thing
that
raises
the
concern
of
the
state,
as
well
it
should--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
if
i
understood
your
question
correctly,
and
i
think
it
was
whether
or
not
if
they
required
them
to
do
it
on
a
weekly
basis,
would
that
be
a
fair
statute.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
your
honor,
that
in
that
form,
in
that
form,
such
a
disclosure
law
might
be
considered
overburdensome
in
that
not
knowing
what
funds
that
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
obtain,
to
expend
the
monies
necessary
to
effectively
publish,
i
would
suppose,
in
a
local
paper
on
a
weekly
basis
might
be
in
itself
such
a
heavy
obligation
as
to
be
prohibitive.
on
the
other
hand,
to
require
an
organization
to
give
out
to
a
perspective
donor
a
statement
of
what
it
has
done
with
its
money,
i
see
no
problem
with
that
whatsoever.
i
think
it
is
entirely
within
the
proper
realm
for
a
state
to
so
regulate
and
doesn't
on
its
face,
at
any
rate,
appear
that
there
would
result
in
any
infringement
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
in
the
statute
in
effect--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--yes,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
however,
i
would
suggest
this.
some
jurisdictions,
that
is
some
states,
i
have
been
advised,
though
i
don't
know
the
particular
states,
publish
this
information
as
a
public
service
on
behalf
of--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
no,
sir,
absolutely
not.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
if
you
had
such
a
statute,
that
if
they
were
compelled
to
forward
a
copy
of
their
financial
statement
of
the
preceding
year,
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
fair
and
adequate.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
sir?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
if
they
were
compelled
to
report
to
the
public,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
once
a
year
would
not
be
unreasonable.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
i
honestly
can't
address
that
to
you,
because
how
detailed
a
statute...
a
state
ultimately
comes--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--no,
sir.
no,
sir,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
at
all,
not
what
i
meant
at
all.
i
am
not
a
legislator.
i
have
seen
statutes
such
as
the
indiana
statute
which
requires
the
information
to
be
given
at
the
time
a
solicitation
is
made
and
a
donor
agrees
to
give
money.
that
would
appear
to
me--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--sir?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
well,
it
was
forwarded
to
me,
your
honor,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
and,
i
would
take
a
few
moments
at
this
time
to
further
try
to
distinguish
the
two
statutes.
it
is
our
position
that,
of
course,
the
maryland
statute
is
truly
overbroad
and
stands
foursquare
along
side
that
statute
in
the
schaumburg
case
and
it
is
our
position--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--thank
you,
justice
o'connor.
i
was
just
coming
to
that
very
point
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
these
or
this
"limited
exemptions"
provision
doesn't
cleanse
this
statute
of
any
overbreadth.
in
fact,
this
exemption
further
burdens
this
statute
to
a
point
that
i
would
suggest
is,
based
on
the
law
of
this
court
in
the
past,
is
just
totally
unacceptable.
it
leaves
a
clear-cut
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
maryland.
you
know,
they
can
say
as
frequently
as
they
might
like
that
we
have
given
14
exceptions.
all
someone
has
to
do
is
come
in
and
apply.
well,
that
is
what
has
been
done
today
and
that
is
what
was
done
yesterday.
but,
what
we
don't
know
is
and
what
we
cannot
allow
to
be
speculated
upon
is
what
is
going
to
be
done
tomorrow.
perhaps
tomorrow
an
organization
will
come
in
who
is
not
particularly
favored
by
this
particular
secretary
of
state
and
then
we
go--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
any
attempt
at
curing
the
overbreadth
by
way
of
an
exemption
provision,
which
in
itself
leaves
a
discretion
in
the
administrative
body,
that
is
a
secretary
of
state
or
other
administrative
officers,
not
withstanding
that
there
may
be
an
appeal
to
a
judicial
body,
is
no
less
offensive,
in
fact,
perhaps
more
offensive
of
first
amendment
rights
as
anything
could
possible
be,
because
you
are
talking
about
leaving
discretion...
i
refer
now
to
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
the
schaumburg
case
in
which
he
so
eloquently
pointed
out
that
it
is
almost
academic
that
if
you
have
a
first
amendment
right
involved
you
cannot
have
discretion.
the
maryland
courts
have
interpreted
the
statute
which,
as
the
court
pointed
out
earlier,
the
state
unfortunately
is
bound
with,
that
it
is
much
too
narrow
so
that
it
does
not
at
all
clear
up
the
issue
of
overbreadth
which
is
so
terribly
apparent
in
the
other
portion
of
the
statute.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
am
sorry,
sir,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
of
course.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
because,
your
honor,
we
didn't
feel
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
we
didn't
feel
that--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--that
is
very
true,
your
honor,
but
then
again--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--you
don't
have
to...
when
a
statute
is
being
challenged
on
first
amendment
group
you
don't
have
to
have
a
violation
of
that
statute,
we
have
what
is
generally
referred
to
in
these
cases
a
chilling
effect
which
gives
us
the
right
to
come
in
and
test
these
statutes.
here,
your
honor,
as
an
example,
an
advocacy
group...
an
advocacy
group
doesn't
want
to
run
the
risk
of
challenging
that
statute.
they
don't
want
to
have
stigma
of
fraud
pointed
in
their
face
because
they
have
violated
the
statute,
have
now
come
back
and
have
now
asked--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--well,
your
honor,
we
didn't
apply
for
the
exemption,
because
frankly,
sir,
we
didn't
feel
we
had
to.
we
felt
that
the
statute
was
wrong,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
and,
therefore,
we
did
not
apply
for
the
exemption
on
those
grounds.
we
weren't
required
to
apply
for
that
exemption,
and,
in
fact,
did
not,
no
more
than
one
would
have
to
apply
for
a
permit
when
they
were
out
in
the
street
canvassing
books
in
connection
with
particular
types
of
religious
beliefs.
i
believe,
if
my
memory
serves
me,
a
case
comes
to
mind,
the
cantwell
case...
no,
a
more
recent
case,
the
hynes
case
versus
oradell.
mr.
hynes
could
have
gone
and
sought
a
permit,
but
he
didn't.
he
went
out
door
to
door
and
solicited
for
his
particular
campaign
because
that
statute,
he
felt,
was
overly
broad
and
facially
unconstitutional
and,
therefore,
he
wasn't
required
to
do
so.
and,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
the
position
in
this
particular
matter.
now,
i
think
perhaps
i
have...
by
your
honor's
questions...
i
have
covered
most
of
the
ground
that
i
intended
to
try
and
cover
here
this
morning.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
certainly,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
well,
your
honor,
the
fraternal
order
of
police
has
evolved
in
the
past
two
years,
i
would
suppose,
in
as
much
as
a
voice
of
the
police
officers
in
connection
with
work-related
activities
that
is
almost
in
the
form
of
a
union
chapter,
if
you
will,
expressing
the
views
of
the
police
officers
as
to
working
conditions,
as
to
benefits
that
might
be
obtainable
by
them,
and
in
an
area
that
is
terribly
important--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--not
entirely,
your
honor.
also,
they
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
connection
with
the
field
of
relations
between
the
police
department
and
the
public
establishing
better
relationships,
working
together
so
that
the
police
officer
is
not
looked
upon
as
this
onerous
person
in
a
blue
uniform,
but
really
as
he
had
been
looked
upon
in
years
gone
by.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
sir?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
public
relations
program.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
each
chapter
does
it,
i
would
presume,
in
their
own
way.
they
promote
certain
local
affairs.
they
go
out
and
participate
in
local
affairs.
i
believe
that
is
how
it
is
done.
with
any
particularity
i
am
sure
i
cannot
answer
as
for
each
chapter.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
another
area.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
as
of
this
time,
whether
or
not
the
montgomery
county
chapter
has
filed
such
report,
i
cannot
answer,
because--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--sir?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
can
tell
you
that
my
client,
the
respondent,
the
munson
organization,
has
not
filed
such
a
report.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
as
to
the
filing
of
a
report?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
absolutely
i
do.
the
filing
of
a
report--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--well,
your
honor,
the
answer...
i
am
not
saying
the
answer
is
no,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
i
do
know
that
under
the
statute
which
we
have
here
before
us
there
is
a
requirement
of
filing
of
complete
financial
information,
yes.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
sir,
i
am--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
variation
is,
what
the
percentage
is
between
how
much
goes
to
the
policeman
who
is
incapacitated
and
how
much
goes
to
the
public
relations
or
just
where
the
line
is
or
what
percentage
on
what
part
of
the
line.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
your
honor,
i--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--i
don't
now,
sir,
and
i
don't
want
to
speculate,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
the
munson
organization?
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
no
question
about
it,
sir.
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
it
is
not,
sir,
that
is
quite
correct.
but,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
not
only
does
this
statute
reach
advocacy
organizations
such
as
the
fpo,
but
reaches
all
advocacy
organizations.
we
are
not
here
today
merely
talking
about
or
seeking
the
assistance
of
this
court
in
connection
with
the
fraternal
order
of
police.
our
whole
position
is
that
this
statute
sweeps
so
broadly
that
it
sweeps
into
it
all
advocacy
organizations
just
as
did
the
schaumburg
case
and
that
the
"limited
exception"
or
the
exception
limitation
doesn't
cleanse
it
and
once
more,
not
only
does
it
not
cleanse
it...
again,
i
refer
to
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
in
the
schaumburg
case...
it
makes
it
worse,
because
it
leaves
discretion
in
a
place
where
discretion
should
be
when
you
are
testing
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
to
the
first
amendment
standards.
it
simply
cannot
be
there.
the...
i
would--
mr.
yale
l.
goldberg
--thank
you.
