ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
of
the
issues
raised
in
this
case
can,
i
believe,
be
stated
in
a
single
question
and
that
is
is
a
state
statute
which
only
limits
the
amounts
a
charity
may
spend
on
some
of
its
fundraising
expenses
and
which
provides
the
charity
a
complete
exemption
from
even
that
limitation
under
certain
circumstances
overbroad
on
its
face
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment;
that
is
has
the
statute
been
shown
to
have
a
substantial
number
of
impermissible
applications?
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
maryland's
petition
for
certiorari
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
held
such
a
statute
facially
overbroad.
maryland
has
substantial
interest,
both
because
of
its
parent
patria
responsibility
with
regard
to
charities
and
because
of
its
obligations
to
protect
its
citizens
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
charitable
organizations.
the
statute,
which
was
invalidated
by
the
court
below,
was
enacted
in
response
to
precisely
these
concerns
as
noted
in
its
preamble
for
prior
to
its
enactment
in
1976
maryland
law
provided,
as
it
does
now,
for
annual
registration
and
disclosure
of
certain
information
by
non-exempt
charitable
organizations
and
paid
solicitors
and
for
strict
criminal
penalties
for
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
however,
the
maryland
legislature
determined
that
these
measures
were
not
sufficient
in
light
of
the
activities
of
some
ostensibly
charitable
organization
that
had
raised
millions
in
contributions
but
had
such
excessively
high
expenses
that
little
of
that
money
had
been
used
for
charitable
purposes.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
yes,
sir.
i
will
address
the
standing
question
right
now,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
justice
rehnquist,
perhaps
i
can
address
it
right
now.
i
believe
there
are
really
sort
of
three
standing
questions
here
before
the
court
today.
there
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
case
of
controversy.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
really
any
dispute
about
that.
it
seems
to
me
there
clearly
is.
this
is
classically
an
adverse
case.
we
have
on
one
side
the
state,
who
has
its
statute
declared
unconstitutional,
and
the
other
side,
a
party
which
may
be
suffer
possible
criminal
prosecution
under
the
statute
and
which
may
suffer
economic
injury
if
the
statute
is,
in
fact,
validated
by
this
court.
the
second
type
of
standing...
issue
here
is
the
jus
tertii
standing,
the
opportunity
to
present
the
rights
of
the
fraternal
order
of
police
by
munson
in
this
case.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
there
is
no
jus
tertii
standing
here.
however,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
issue
is
terribly
important
except
in
one
respect
and
that
is
because
in
any
event
munson
is
going
to
have
to
demonstrate
overbreadth
and
it
is
the
state's
position
that
there
is
no
overbreadth
standing
and
there
is
not
an
overbreadth
challenge
on
the
merits
here.
and,
the
determination
of
those
two
questions,
it
seems
to
me,
are
linked
to
the
same
kind
of
considerations.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
believe
it
was
clearly
based
on
federal
law,
your
honor.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
this
is
the
first
case
in
maryland
in
which
there
was
ever
found
any
jus
tertii
standing,
the
first
case.
and,
it
was
based,
i
think,
quite
clearly
on
craig
versus
boren
and
a
series
of
cases
of
this
court
and
most
particularly,
of
course,
the
schaumburg
case.
i
was
talking
about
the
preamble
to
the
legislation
that
we
have
at
issue
here.
the
maryland
legislature
determined--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--yes,
sir.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
very,
very
clear
that
the
question
of
whether...
the
real
question
here
is
whether
there
is
overbreadth
standing.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
i
believe
you
do
because
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
or
not
there
is
jus
tertii
standing
the
respondent
here
could
make
an
overbreadth
challenge
separate
and
apart
from
any
jus
tertii
standing.
and,
it
would
be
the
state's
submission
that
the
overbreadth
challenge
is
not
a
good
challenge,
that
the
merits
determination
on
overbreadth
should
be
a
finding
by
this
court
that
this
statute
is
not
substantially
overbroad
and
this
court
should
do
exactly
what
it
did
in
new
york
versus
ferber.
that
case
came
to
you
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
that
court
found
that
the
statute
was,
indeed,
overbroad.
this
court
reversed
and
sent
it
back
to
the
state
court
for
proceedings
consistent
with
that
reversal
and
that
is
what
i
submit
should
be
done
here.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
get
there,
justice
stevens,
but
that
is,
in
fact,
our
position
now,
yes,
sir.
the
general
assembly,
recognizing
the
activities
of
some
ostensibly
charitable
organizations
that
have
raised
millions
of
dollars
in
contributions,
but
have
had
such
excessively
high
expenses,
that
little
of
that
money
had
been
used
for
charitable
purposes,
enacted
reform
legislation,
of
which
the
statute
challenged
here
was
a
principal
feature,
to
provide
a
more
effective
regulation
over
fundraising
expenses
without
imposing
and
intolerable
burden
on
charity
and,
in
the
words
of
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
"to
assure
the
contributions
will
be
used
to
benefit
the
intended
purpose.
"
the
challenged
statute
operates
as
follows:
first,
it
provides
that
a
charity
may
spend
on
fundraising
expenses
no
more
than
25
percent
of
the
income
raised
by
the
fundraising
activity.
the
statute,
however,
in
no
way
limits
a
charity's
administrative
expenses,
thus,
management,
overhead
and
general
staff
salaries
are
subjected
to
no
limitation.
in
addition,
the
maryland
statute
excludes
from
the
fundraising
limitation
a
number
of
major
items
which
are
ordinarily
regarded
as
fundraising
expenses.
for
example,
the
cost
of
all
goods,
food
or
drink
or
entertainment
sold
or
provided
to
the
public,
the
cost
of
pre-planning
and
feasibility
studies,
and
the
cost
of
postage
and
printing
are
expressly
excluded
from
the
fundraising
limitation
and
so
may
be
freely
incurred
without
limits.
moreover,
a
statute
can
gain...
a
charity
can
gain
a
complete
exemption
from
the
25
percent
limitation
when
the
limitation
would
effectively
prevent
the
charity
from
raising
contributions
and
this
exemption
may
be
applied
for
even
if
the
charity
has
already
exceeded
the
fundraising
limitation.
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
court
below,
the
secretary
of
state's
records
show
14
organizations
requested
and
exemption
and
13
waivers
from
the
25
percent
limitation
were
granted.
if
a
waiver
is
granted,
then
a
charity
must
disclose
to
the
public
every
time
it
solicits
on
the
telephone,
in
the
mail,
or
in
person,
that
it
has
been
granted
a
waiver
from
the
25
percent
limitation
and
the
amount
that
it
has
been
authorized
to
spend
or
has
spent
on
fundraising
expenses.
of
course,
any
decision
denying
a
waiver
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
respondent,
joseph
h.
munson
company,
at
whose
behest,
the
court
below
held
the
statute
i
have
just
described
unconstitutional,
is
an
indiana-for-profit
corporation
whose
sole
business,
according
to
its
amended
bill
of
complaint,
is
to
advise
charitable
organizations
how
to
go
about
promoting
an
entertainment
event.
also
according
to
the
bill
of
complaint,
munson
regularly
collects
from
charities
for
its
services
more
than
25
percent
of
the
income
raised
by
these
services.
the
firm's
only
client
in
maryland
is
the
fraternal
order
of
police,
one
of
whose
chapters,
it
has
been
stipulated,
was
reluctant
to
enter
into
a
fundraising
contract
with
munson
because
of
the
25
percent
limitation
at
issue
here.
in
this
respect
it
is
significant
that
a
number
of
other
chapters
of
the
same
charity,
the
fraternal
order
of
police,
have
on
several
occasions
applied
for
a
waiver
from
the
25
percent
limitation
and
on
each
occasion
the
waiver
has
been
granted.
finally,
while
it
has
been
stipulated
that
the
fraternal
order
of
police
engages
in
the
dissemination
of
information
and
the
advocacy
of
causes
on
the
behalf
of
police
officers,
there
is
no
stipulation
and
the
record
shows
no
connection
between
such
activities
and
the
fundraising
activities
at
which
the
maryland
statute
is
directed.
the
basis
upon
which--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--yes,
ma'am.
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
there
are
limits.
in
our
view,
the
exemption
is
only
available,
as
it
says
in
the
statute,
when
the
charity
can
show
that
without
the
exemption,
with
the
limitation,
contributions
would...
i
don't
have
exactly
the
words
of
the
statute
here,
but
in
those
instances
which
the
limitation
would
effectively
prevent
the
charitable
organization
from
raising
contributions.
in
our
view
and
in
practice
before
the
secretary,
it
is
an
economic
determination.
the
secretary
has
in
front
of
her
the
case
that
the
charity
makes
that
the
need
the
exemption
for
economic
reasons.
now,
there
are
any
number
of
economic
reasons
for
which
the
charity
has
granted
the
exemption,
a
new
organization,
an
organization
with
new
activities,
an
organization
with
a
new
program,
an
organization
that
wants
to
pursue
a
program
in
a
different
way,
a
one-time
or
extraordinary
expense,
any
one
of
those
kinds
of
things,
but
they
are
all
economically
grounded.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
think
that
the
practice
has
been
they
would
raise
less
money.
they
have
had
an
unsuccessful
track
record.
they
haven't
been
able
to
raise--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
sure
i
would
go
that
far,
but
the
secretary
has
been
liberal
in
granting
the
exemptions
and
if
a
charity
comes
in
with
a
showing--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--there
were
14
organizations
that
requested
exemption
and
13
of
those
were
granted.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
before
this
lawsuit...
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
1978.
for
two
years
nothing
happened
at
all.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
post
the
beginning
of
this
litigation.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
the
statute
was
not
enacted
until
1976,
so
the
regulations,
in
fact,
were
not
promulgated
until
february
of
'78.
so,
it
has
taken
awhile
to
get
a
record,
if
you
will,
of
the
practice
here.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
do,
your
honor.
our
highest
court
said,
which,
it
seems
to
me,
is
absolutely
true,
that
regulations
can
go
no
further
than
the
statute
and
the
matter
that
this
court
and,
indeed,
every
court
i
am
familiar
with
has
ever
held.
and,
we
believe
that
the
way
which
those
regulations
have
been
interpreted
by
the
secretary,
the
practice
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
statute
and
has
gone
no
further
than
the
statutory
authority.
and,
indeed,
respondent
makes
no
contention
the
contrary.
his
contention
is
not
that
the
regulations
go
further
than
the
statute.
he
simply
says
that
the
regulations
and
the
statute
don't
give
enough
discretion
don't
give
enough
exemption
authority.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
think
that
is
right.
i
have
the
general
assembly
has
spoken
it
seems
to
me.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
that
is
right,
justice
powell.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
those
expenses,
those
salaries
are
not
touched
by
the
maryland
statute.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
nor
is
rent,
no,
sir.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
no,
sir.
none--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--what
is
touched
are
what
is
defined
as
explicitly
fundraising
expenses.
and,
the
way
the
maryland
statute
directs
that
a
charity...
that
these
be
allocated
is
consistent
with
standards
of--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--printing
of
materials
that
are
mailed
is
not
included.
printing
of
other
materials
is
included.
the
cost
of
telephone
solicitors
is
included.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
radio
cost,
advertising
cost,
yes,
sir,
all
of
those
are
limited
by
the
exemption...
by
the
limitation.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
but,
none
of
what
would
be
thought
of
as
administrative
costs,
attorney's
fees,
bookkeeping,
the
salaries
of
people
that
are
at
headquarters,
researchers,
none
of
that
is
touched
by
the
maryland
statute.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
that
would
be
covered,
justice
white,
except
if
the
fundraiser
was
doing
a
feasibility
or
preplanning
study,
the
professional
fundraiser.
if
they
were
doing
that
kind
of
study,
that
expense
is
expressly
excluded
from
the
fundraising
limitation.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
the
staff
of
the
charity--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--of
the
united
fund,
for
example,
the
charities'
expense
accounts,
the
administrative
expense
accounts?
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
sir,
if--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--i
don't
think
that
problem...
well,
if
all
that
this
person
does--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--well,
i
don't
suggest,
justice
marshall,
that
this
statute
covers
every
problem.
i
think
if
that
person
is
only
working
on
soliciting
contributions,
then
the
expense
account
money
would,
indeed,
be
covered
by
this
limitation.
if
that
person
is
working
in
the
central
staff
office
on
administration,
his
expense
account
would
not
be.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
in
point
of
fact,
we
don't
have...
we
don't
have
any
showing
here--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--well,
justice
white,
if
we
assume
further
that
the
group
that
is
denied
the
waiver
is
an
advocacy
organization,
then
i
think
we...
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
the
maryland
statute
can
be
applied
constitutionally.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
be
applied
unconstitutionally.
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
for
case-by-case
determination.
we
are
talking
about
an
advocacy
group--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--i
am
saying--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
i
think
it,
your
honor.
i
think
that
may
be
possible.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
let
me
try
to
articulate
my
position
on
it.
i
think
the
position
i
would
take,
justice
white,
is
there
has
been
no
showing
here.
i
think
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
this
statute
is
ever
going
to
be
applied
unconstitutionally
against
any
group.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
no,
sir.
i
thought
that
i
was
taking
your
hypothetical
which
was
an
advocacy
group
that
had
been
denied
the
exemption.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
think
it
is
arguable
that
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
advocacy
group
is
ever
going
to
be
denied
the
exemption.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
think
that
one
can
assume
here,
as
one
did
in
broadrick,
that
it
is
possible
the
statute
may
have
a
limited
number
of
impermissible
applications.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
avoiding
it
exactly
as
it
was
avoided
in
broadrick,
that
the
chance
of...
the
likelihood
of
that
happening
is
so
infinitesimal
that
we
would
reserve
that
case
to
a
case-by-case
determination.
if
there
was
ever
a
statute
built
for
a
case-by-case
determination,
i
submit,
justice
white,
it
is
this
one.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
no,
sir,
that
is
why
we
are
here
before
you.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
i
think,
justice
white,
what
they
did
was
try
to
apply
the
schaumburg
analysis
in
a
mechanistic
way
and
not
look
at
the
true
and
substantial
differences
between
this
case
and
schaumburg.
it
is
the
state's
submission
that
the
schaumburg
holding
does
not
require
invalidation
of
the
maryland
statute.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
i
would
certainly
hope
not,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
dismayed
that
there
might
be
a
chance
of
that
and
that
is
why
i
have
tried
to
address
that
point
right
now.
that
is
because,
we
submit,
there
are
substantial,
significant
differences
between
the
statute
we
have
here
and
the
ordinance
in
schaumburg.
perhaps
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
while
the
schaumburg
ordinance
was
a
direct
regulation
of
door-to-door
solicitation,
conduct
which
has
been
recognized
as
often
so
intertwined
with
advocacy
as
to
be
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
the
maryland
statute
is
not
directed
to
door-to-door
solicitation,
but
rather
at
charitable
fundraising
expenses.
fundraising,
as
you
know,
may
be
conducted
in
a
variety
of
ways
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
advocacy
like
dances,
garden
tours,
bingo
games,
things
like
this,
and,
of
course,
the
entertainment
shows
which
are
the
speciality
of
the
respondent
here.
now,
true,
fundraising
may
include
solicitation
intertwined
with
advocacy.
this
is
the
point
we
were
getting
at
earlier.
but,
there
is
no
showing
here
that
any
solicitation
intertwined
with
advocacy
has
been
or
will
be
or
is
likely
to
be
threatened
by
the
maryland
statute
or
that
any
group
engaging
in
any
solicitation
intertwined
with
advocacy
has
even
needed
to
apply
for
a
waiver
from
the
fundraising
limitation,
let
alone
been
denied
one.
the
second
important
difference,
i
think,
between
the
statute
and
the
ordinance
in
schaumburg
is
the
situation
i
was
discussing
with
justice
powell
a
few
minutes
ago
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
schaumburg
ordinance
limited
a
charity
to...
limited
its
administrative
as
well
as
fundraising
expenses;
that
is
general
staff
salary,
rents,
telephones,
attorney's
fees.
all
of
those
general
expenses
were
limited
by
the
schaumburg
ordinance
as
well
as
fundraising
expenses.
the
maryland
statute
does
not
attempt
to
limit
the
administrative
expenses,
rather
it
attempts
to
strike
at
the
heart
of
the
problem
of
excessive
fundraising
without
unduly
intruding
into
the
internal
affairs
of
a
charitable
organization
by
limiting
only
fundraising
expenses.
thirdly,
the
schaumburg
ordinance
required
a
charity,
prior
to
any
solicitation,
to
obtain
a
permit
and
in
order
to
obtain
the
permit
the
charity
had
to
prove
that
at
least
75
percent
of
its
income
in
the
previous
year
had
been
used
directly
for
charitable
purposes,
thus,
there
was
no
way
a
charity
could,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
alter
its
spending
patterns
in
the
short
term
to
comply
with
the
75
percent
requirement.
the
maryland
statute
imposes
neither
of
these
serious
burdens
on
a
charity.
first,
it
does
not
require
a
charity
to
prove
compliance
with
the
percentage
limitation
prior
to
engaging
in
fundraising
activities.
and,
second,
the
maryland
statute
allows
a
charity
to
apply
the
limitation
retrospectively
on
an
annual
or
a
campaign-by-campaign
basis.
so
that
even
in
a
short
run,
a
charity
can,
indeed,
alter
its
spending
patterns
to
comply
with
the
maryland
statute.
fourth,
the
schaumburg
ordinance
flatly
bans
the
solicitation
by
charities
that
spent
more
than
a
certain
percentage
on
non-program
expenses.
in
contrast,
the
maryland
statute
simply
subjects
expenses
in
excess
of
the
percentage
limitation
to
scrutiny.
if
a
charity
can
demonstrate
the
limitation
effectively
prevents
it
from
raising
funds,
it
can
obtain
a
complete
exemption
from
the
waiver,
something
that
was
simply
impossible
under
the
schaumburg
ordinance.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
it
is
not
a...
well,
it
is
a
complete
exemption,
but--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--there
is
a
disclosure
requirement.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
it
would
let
the
prospective
donor
know.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
yes.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons,
justice
stevens.
first,
and
probably
the
one
that
is
most
persuasive
to
us
is
that
i
am
not
just
sure
disclosure
really
works.
in
a
variety
of
situations,
from
cigarette
packs
to
securities
regulations,
disclosure,
no
matter
how
full
it
is,
no
matter
when
it
is
given,
just
simply
doesn't
really
do
the
trick
all
the
time.
now,
it
is
a
part
of
our
statute.
it
is
hoped
that
it
does
inform--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--well,
the
problem--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--well,
the
problem
here
though
is
it
raises...
we
are
telling
people
we
spend
10
percent
on
fundraising
expenses...
raises
more
questions
than
it
answers.
it
tells
people
that
and
then
it
immediately
invites
questions.
and,
the
person
who
is
often
doing
the
soliciting
is
either
a
volunteer,
who
doesn't
know
very
much
about
the
innerworkings
of
the
charity
or
why
the
10
percent
is
high
or
the
10
percent
is
low,
or
a
paid
solicitor
paid
at
a
minimum
wage
rate
whose
in
the
same
situation,
although
for
different
reasons,
and
it
is
the
charities
themselves
who
have
almost
across-the-board...
i
notice
they
don't
say
it
in
their
amici
briefs
to
this
court,
but
they
have,
for
example,
testified
before
the
maryland
general
assembly
that
disclosure
requirements,
point
of
solicitation
disclosure
requirements
raise
more
questions
than
they
answer
and,
therefore,
put
an
undue
burden
on
the
charity
and
don't
give
the
public
the
real
story.
now
i
think
there
is
some
truth
in
that,
your
honor.
i
think
they
tell
you
something.
they
don't
tell
you
everything
and
they
are
not...
it
seems
to
us
they
are
not
as
protective
of
maryland's
interest
as
the
statute
we
have
here.
and,
we
believe
the
statute
we
have
here
does
not
impose
very
much
burden,
more
burden
on
charities
than
that
would.
finally,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
court
below
not
only
erred
in
failing
to
recognize
the
substantive
differences
between
the
ordinance
struck
down
in
schaumburg
and
the
statute
involved
here,
but
it
also
failed
to
apply
the
correct
test
of
validity,
the
test
that
was
applied
by
this
court
in
schaumburg,
the
substantial
overbreadth
test.
in
schaumburg
this
court
held
the
ordinance
bad
because
it
constituted
a
substantial
limitation
on
protected
activity.
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
schaumburg,
this
court
has
reiterated
the
test
of
substantiality
in
new
york
versus
ferber
where
it
said
that
a
statute
would
be
stricken
as
overbroad
under
the
first
amendment
only
if
it
were
shown
to
have
a
substantial
number
of
impermissible
applications.
there
is
no
showing
in
this
case
that
the
maryland
statute
has
had,
will
have,
or
is
likely
to
have
any
impermissible
applications.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
justice
white,
rests
entirely
upon
conjecture.
there
is
neither
the
respondent
nor
the
fraternal
order
of
police
nor
any
of
the
amici
who
have
presented
a
point
of
view
to
this
court
has
shown
that
this
statute
has
limited
or
threatens
to
limit
the
dissemination
of
information
or
the
advocacy
of
ideas.
if
i
could
compare
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--sir,
if
i...
no,
i
don't
think
it
need
be
supported
by
evidence
in
the
record.
i
think
in
order
to
show
substantial
overbreadth
one
must
find
that
it
is
realistic
to
expect
the
statute
will,
in
fact,
be
overbroad.
here,
i
submit,
it
is
not
realistic
to
expect
that.
i
think
what
one--
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
--i
think
what
you
say
is...
while
in
schaumburg
it
was
likely,
it
was
almost
inevitable.
indeed,
this
court
found
it
was
a
group
to
which
this
statute
could
not
constitutionally
be
applied.
i
think
it
is
impossible,
particularly
with
the
waiver
provision,
to
ever
find
that
about
this
statute;
that
there
is
a
group
to
which
it
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied.
it
simply
isn't
here.
that
is
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law
i
submit.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
i
will
try
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
i
have
just
one
point,
your
honor.
ms.
diana
gribbon
motz
thank
you
very
much.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
about
the
interests
that
the
state
is
asserting
here
and
i
feel
that
i
maybe
unfortunately
mislead
the
court.
the
interests
we
are
asserting
here
are
somewhat
different,
i
think,
than
the
interests
that
were
asserted
in
the
schaumburg
case.
you
will
remember
in
schaumburg,
the
village
asserted
that
defraud
interest,
and
they
asserted
that
those
people
who
spent
more
than
25
percent
on
non-charity
expenses
were
fraudulent
in
representing
themselves
as
a
charity.
the
state
of
maryland
makes
no
such
contention.
indeed,
what
this
statute
is
trying
to
reach
is
the
use
of
charitable
contributions
for
non-charitable
purposes,
something
which
may
not
necessarily
be
and
which
probably
in
many
instances
is
not
criminal,
fraudulent
misrepresentation
under
an
ordinary
fraud
statute.
what
it
is,
we
submit,
is
something
which
entitles
the
state
to
be
on
notice
as
to
the
activities
of
the
organization
and
to
scrutinize
those
activities
when
their
fundraising
expenses
are
more
than
25
percent.
and,
that
is
precisely
what
the
maryland
statute
does.
it
does
not
assume
that
those
activities
are
fraudulent.
what
it
does
is
assume
that
they
are
entitled
to
be
scrutinized
by
the
state
and
if
the
charity
makes
a
showing
that,
indeed,
those
expenses
are
reasonable,
it
may
go
out
and
continue
to
solicit
provided
it
discloses
that
to
the
public.
and,
if
it
does
not
make
that
showing
then
it
is
not
entitled
to
solicit.
of
course,
that
decision
goes
to
judicial
review.
we
believe
in
that
way,
without
imposing
any
great
burden
on
the
charity,
we
have
protected
the
potential
donor,
the
intended
beneficiary,
and
we
have,
in
general,
benefited
charity
by
insuring
the
appearance
as
well
as
the
reality
of
integrity
charitable
organizations.
