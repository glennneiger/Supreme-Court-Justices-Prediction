unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that,
mr.
dion,
in
the
papers?
where
do
we
find
1962(a)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dion,
you
say
that
the
government
relies
on
speeches
by
individual
senators
and
house
members
and
you
rely
on
synopses
and
a
preamble.
neither
of
you
rely
on
the
words
of
the
statute
itself?
unknown
speaker
at
that
point
you
go
to
the
secondary
theory.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dion,
with
respect
to
congress'
stated
purpose
which,
as
i
understand
it,
was
to
eradicate
organized
crime,
why
in
the
world
would
congress
have
wanted
to
exempt
from
forfeiture
cash
profits
that
are
the
primary
product
of
an
illegal
enterprise?
i
think
your
argument
is
a
little
strange
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
congress'
whole
purpose
to
make
a
crime
unprofitable?
unknown
speaker
and,
if
you
don't
forfeit
the
profits,
how
do
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
letter
referred
to
a
different
version
of
the
bill
that
was
eventually
enacted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dion,
looking
again
at
the
language
of
1963(a)
as
it
appears
in
your
brief
at,
i
guess,
the
second
page
of
the
appendix,
what
is
the
difference
in
operation
between
subsection...
what
does
subsection
(2)
have
that
subsection
(1)
doesn't
and
and
vice
versa?
the
defendant
would
respectfully
submit
that
what
(a)(1)
hits
are...
what
are
referred
to
in
a
couple
of
the
cases
as
passive
investments
while
(a)(2)
hits
active
investments.
(a)(2)
in
particularly
goes
to
those
things
which
afford
a
source
of
control
over
an
enterprise.
does
that
modify
all
of
the
terms,
interest
and
security
of
claim
against?
are
all
of
those
modified
by
the
language,
affording
a
source
of
control
or
influence
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
reach
of
(1)
somehow
narrower
than
(2)?
unknown
speaker
what
then
does
(a)(2)
reach
that
(a)(1)
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
but,
surely,
when
congress
is
writing
in
one
single
paragraph
that
someone
shall
forfeit
to
the
united
states,
(1),
and
then
a
sentence,
and
then,
(2),
a
sentence,
we
assume
that
congress
has
two
different...
it
was
striking
at
two
different
things
or
it
would
have
put
it
all
in
one
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
you
misspoke
or
if
i
was
incorrectly
advised,
but
was
it
not
(a)(2)
that
was
originally
in
the
statute
and
(a)(1)
that
was
added
later?
unknown
speaker
because
the
original
draft,
i
thought,
was
expressly
limited
to
interest
in
an
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
(a)(2).
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
words
(a)(2),
but
not
in
(a)(1).
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
under
your
reading,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
it
is
not
tenable,
but
you
in
effect
read
in
the
words
(a)(1)
and
you
also
treat
the
violation
of
section
1962
language
as
though
it
said
violation
of
section
1962(a)
or
(b).
you
don't
really,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
deal
with
the
possibility
that
(a)(1)
may
cover...
may
refer
to
1962(c)?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
if
the
government...
if
you
lose
that
the
entire
property
would
have
been
forfeitable?
unknown
speaker
not
just
the
profit
from
the
illegal
activity?
unknown
speaker
you
say,
mr.
dion,
that
here
we
are
going
into
the
area
of
policy
formulation.
does
that
mean
in
effect
that
we
throw
up
our
hands
and
say
we
have
no
idea
what
congress
wanted
as
between
these
two
choices
so
we
just
have
to
pick
what
seems
to
us
the
better
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
constitutional
problem?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
were
you
raising
that
as
the
policy
question?
is
that
what
you
meant
by
policy?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
concern
the
judicial
process?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
right
there?
what
exactly
is
it
that
you
contend
should
be
forfeited
to
the
united
states
as
opposed
to
what
the
insurance
company
might
get
back?
i
take
it
that
the
insurance
company
might
have
a
claim
to
this
money
too.
unknown
speaker
so
the
end
result
would
be
the
same?
the
government
would,
in
effect,
collect
the
forfeited
property
and
turn
it
back
to
the
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
actually
the
money
ends
up...
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
about
undesirability
about
bringing
litigation,
but
assuming
that
the
rights
were
enforced
by
civil
litigation,
the
net
result
would
really
be
pretty
much
the
same
anyway,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
at
least
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
brings
the
suit,
mr.
alito,
are
treble
damages
available
though?
unknown
speaker
and,
if
the
victim
did,
the
victim
would
get
treble
damages?
unknown
speaker
could
the
victim
bring
a
suit
for
treble
damages
even
after
the
government
had
imposed
a
civil
forfeiture?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
resolved?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
give
me
examples
of
what
you
think
would
be
covered
under
(a)(2)
in
your
interpretation
that
wouldn't
already
be
covered
in
(a)(1)?
it
is
just
hard
to
make
perfectly
clear
what
those
two
subsections
were
intended
to
cover
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
that
really
isn't
quite
right,
is
it,
because
in
(a)(2),
if
you
maintain
an
interest
of
that
kind,
it
is
in
violation
of
section
1962.
and,
(a)(1)
covers
not
only
acquisition
but
also
maintaining
an
interest.
i
think
you
just
forgot
about
the
word
(a)(1).
any
interest
maintained
in
violation
of
1962
is
forfeitable
under
(a)(1).
unknown
speaker
and,
it
seems
to
me
all
of
your
examples
under
(a)(2)
are
interests
that
would
be
maintained
unlawfully.
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
a
concrete
example
then
of
what
you
think
would
be
covered
by
(a)(2)
that
is
not
covered
by
(a)(1)?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
wouldn't
be
maintained
in
the
language
of
(a)(1),
the
business
maintained--
unknown
speaker
--but,
are
you
satisfied
that
in
your
view
(a)(1)
covers
some
things
that
(a)(2)
doesn't
and
(a)(2)
covers
some
things
that
(a)(1)
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
i
mean
you
suggested
one
example.
i
still
am
not
clear
on
what
else
you
have
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
well...
but,
(a)(1)
would
pick
up
that,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
need
(a)(2)?
unknown
speaker
you
can
pick
up
everything
under
(a)(1)
if
i
am
understanding
you
correctly.
unknown
speaker
i
supposed
maintained
in
(a)(1)
could
mean
the
situation
where
the
thing
was
begun
lawfully
so
that
you
couldn't
say
it
was
acquired
in
violation
of
1962.
but,
then
it
gets
unlawful
in
the
course
of
operating
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
some
dicta
in,
for
instance,
the
contract
law
of
remedies
that
equity
abhors
a
forfeiture.
they
will
read
something
as...
they
will
try
to
avoid
reading
it
as
a
condition
that
will
result
in
a
forfeiture,
say,
by
failure
to
complete
a
building?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
bright
distinction
between
what
you
refer
to
as
in
rem
forfeitures
and
in
personam
forfeitures?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
i
own
a
boat
and
it
is
forfeited
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
admiralty,
i
am
still
without
the
boat
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
you
know,
even
if
you
call
it
in
rem.
unknown
speaker
your
contention
then
really
is
that
interest
in
the
term
(a)(1)
means
any
real
or
personal
property,
tangible
or
intangible?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
specifically
is
the
property
that
is
being
forfeited
by
the
district
court
order
here?
unknown
speaker
cash?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
i
might
interrupt,
is
i
gather
they
included
or
they
added
subsection
(1)
without
any
particular
explanation
or
debate
focusing
on
that
subjection,
isn't
that
true?
that
is
one
of
our
problems,
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
for
the
fact...
this
is
a
very
tricky
case.
i
must
confess
to
be
very
puzzled
by
it.
but,
except
for
the
fact,
as
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested,
if
you
are
talking
about
any
property
of
any
kind
in
the
way
of
profits,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
congress
would
have
been
more
apt
to
use
the
kind
of
language
it
used
in
section
848.
whereas
this
does
have
at
least...
there
is
a
tenable
explanation
for
this,
namely,
the
difference
between
passive
and
active
investments.
this
would
pick
up,
which
(a)(2)
wouldn't,
using
proceeds
to
buy
two
percent
of
some
publicly...
to
buy
an
interest
in
a
publicly
held
legitimate
business.
that
would
be
forfeitable,
as
i
understand
it,
under
(a)(1),
but
would
not
be
forfeitable
under
(a)(2).
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
some
sensible
explanation
for
his
reading
that
does
not
make
the
two
just
redundant
really.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
with
his
reading
is
you
have
got
to
stick
some
extra
words
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
alito,
do
you
think
you
could
take
a
senator's
statement
on
the
floor
that
we
want
ill-gotten
gains
forfeited
and
say
he
must
have
meant
profits
as
opposed
to
other
kinds
of
interests?
unknown
speaker
but,
my
query
was
whether
senator
mcclellan
was
really
focusing
on
the
fine
distinctions
that
perhaps
the
statute
might
have
drawn
when
he
said
ill-gotten
gain.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
the
language
was
all
that
clear,
probably
this
case
wouldn't
be
here.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument,
your
argument
in
chief,
the
statute
is
a
little
confusing--
unknown
speaker
--and
hard
to
parse.
so
you
must
turn
to
secondary
sources
like
the
government
does,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
the
government
is
entitled
to
turn
to
its
secondary
sources
like
you
are.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
are
not
in
the
position
of
a
civil
litigant
either
where
it
is
kind
of
evenly
divided.
it
goes
perhaps
to
the
person
without
the
burden
of
proof.
you
have
the
presumption
of
lenity
in
a
criminal
action
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dion,
you
do
concede
that
congress,
in
its
stated
purpose,
intended
to
eradicate
organized
crime,
do
you
not?
