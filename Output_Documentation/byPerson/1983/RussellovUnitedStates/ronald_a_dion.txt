mr.
ronald
a.
dion
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
issue
that
is
being
presented
today
is
the
scope
of
the
rico
forfeiture
statute
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
1970,
in
particular,
section
1963(a)(1).
we
will
try,
in
the
oral
argument,
to
not
get
into
a
bingo
contest.
unfortunately,
a
lot
of
the
sections
in
1962
and
1963
are
interrelated.
most
of
the
argument
is
going
to
deal
with
the
interrelationship
of
those
two
statutes.
first
of
all,
the
simple
question
is
whether
or
not
the
term
1963(a)(1)
permits
the
forfeiture
of
income
proceeds
and
profits
of
illegal
racketeering
activity
or
whether
it
does
no
so
include
it.
the
first
thing
we
need
to
do,
of
course,
is
go
to
the
express
wording
of
the
statute.
as
in
many
of
these
cases
of
statutory
construction,
both
the
government
and
the
defense
have
argued
that
the
express
wording,
as
well
as
the
intent
of
the
legislature
and
the
legislative
history
supports
their
respective
positions.
if
we
take
a
look
first
at
the
express
wording
of
1963(a)(1),
it
is
important
to
note,
as
several
courts
have
held...
in
particular,
i
would
like
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
the
case
of
united
states
versus
mcmanigall
which
was
decided
after
the
briefs
were
filed,
which
is
out
of
the
7th
circuit.
each
of
those
courts
have
held
that
it
is
of
interest
that
the
actual
words
1963(a)(1).
it
is
important
for
two
reasons.
one
of
the
reasons
that
is
relied
upon
that
i
think
is
secondary
is
the
inclusion
of
the
words
in
the
c.c.e.
statute
848
which
was
decided
and
passed
within
two
weeks
of
the
passage
of
the
rico
statute.
and,
in
fact,
in
that
statute
in
the
forfeiture
provisions,
congress
did
in
fact
specify
the
forfeiture
of
proceeds.
however,
i
believe
that
is
secondary.
i
think
first
we
have
to
look
at
the
actual
rico
statute
itself.
if
we
take
a
look
at
1962(a)--
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
--a
copy
of
it
is
in
our
appendix
at
appendix
1,
your
honor.
1962(a)
is
most
illuminating
in
that
in
that
section
congress
did
in
fact
use
the
term
"interest".
did
in
fact
use
the
term
"income",
and
did
in
fact
independently
use
the
word
"proceeds".
now,
the
government's
argument,
at
least
one
of
the
positions,
was
that
when
congress
includes
language
in
one
section
of
the
statute
and
doesn't
include
it
in
another
section,
there
must
be
a
reason.
we
obviously
do
not
disagree
with
that
at
all
in
this
context.
in
1962(a)
congress
used
the
terms
c.c.e.
statute,
when
they
wished
to
make
it
forfeitable,
they
said
it
was
forfeitable.
the
question
then
comes
up
to
what
is
the
interest
included
in
1963(a)(1)?
what
are
we
talking
about?
i
would
like
to
first
take
a
shortcut.
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
relies
upon
is
a
dictionary
definition
of
the
term
"interest".
and,
one
of
the
dictionary...
not
the
legal
definition,
but
the
common
webster's
dictionary
of
american
heritage
dictionary
definition
is
that
it
includes
the
term
"profit".
i
would
like
the
court
to
understand
what
they
mean
by
profit
in
that
definition
of
the
word
"interest".
when
you
go
to
a
bank
and
you
take
out
a
loan
and
you
pay
money
to
the
bank
for
that
privilege,
the
interest
is
the
profit
the
bank
has
made.
it
is
not
the
same
context
as
the
dictionary
definition
in
a
legal
sense.
black's
law
dictionary
defines
it
differently.
that
is
the
definition
that
was
used
by
the
martino
dissent,
by
the
thevis
court
and
by
the
mcmanigall
court.
the
most
general
term
that
can
be
employed
to
denote
a
right,
claim,
title,
or
legal
share
in
something.
this
is
where
a
lot
of
lower
courts
went
out
and
said,
all
right,
if
it
is
an
interest
in
something,
what
is
the
something
that
we
are
talking
about.
in
a
number
of
the
courts,
including
a
new
case
that
was
decided
by
the
10th
circuit
since
this
case
was
submitted,
united
states
versus
zang,
has
said,
let's
us
look
at
the
rico
statute
in
its
entirety.
what
is
it
that
makes
the
rico
statute
different
from
other
criminal
statutes?
what
is
that
we
are
attempting
to
punish
since
obviously
this
is
a
form
of
enhancement?
it
is
a
form
of
we
take
the
substantive
crime
and
if
they
done
it
more
than
one
time
and
other
elements
are
there,
we
now
have
a
new
crime
which
we
have
construed
in
1970
called
rico.
and,
that
something
in
addition
is,
in
fact,
the
enterprise
concept.
so,
these
courts
have
gone
to
say
that
when
we
talk
about
an
interest
in
something,
the
something
we
are
talking
about
is
the
enterprise.
they
then
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
the
actual
wording
of
the
statute.
in
1962,
and
other
than
in
one
place
in
1963,
which
is
the
source
of
litigation
here
today,
whenever
congress
used
the
term
"interest",
it
said
"interest
in
an
enterprise".
now,
one
of
the
questions
the
government
has
raised
is
why
then
in
1963(a)(1)
does
congress
not
say
interest
in
an
enterprise
when
in
1963(a)(2)
and
elsewhere
throughout
the
statute,
they
say
"interest
in"
and
the
government
conveniently
says
three
or
four
dots
"an
enterprise".
i
would
submit
that
the
reason
that
it
is
included
in
(a)(2)
and
not
in
(2)(1)
is
what
is
missing,
what
those
dots
represent.
we
would
submit
that
what
congress
has
already
stated
throughout
the
substantive
events,
that
it
is
an
1963(a)
at
all,
but
that
the
reason
they
did
it
in
(a)(2)
was
to
make
very
clear,
not
that
the
interest
which
is
forfeitable
is
the
interest
in
the
enterprise,
but
rather
that
the
security
of,
claim
against,
or
property
or
contractual
right
of
any
kind
affording
the
source
of
influence
over
is
modified
by
the
term
"any
enterprise",
since
those
terms
are
not
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute
with
the
said
modification.
a
lot
of
the
courts
and
some
of
the
law
review
articles
condemn
the
courts
for
this,
then
go
into
a
question
of
legislative
history.
and,
as
with
many
of
these
cases,
both
the
government
and
the
defense
submit
that
the
legislative
history
supports
their
respective
positions.
there
is
a
slight
difference,
however.
if
the
court
would
take
a
look
at
the
references
that
the
government
has
made
to
support
their
concept
of
legislative
history,
they
are
statements,
speeches,
and
parts
of
the
record,
congressional
record,
that
reflect
the
opinions
of
individual
senators
and
members
of
the
house.
it
is
not
the
position
of
the
entire
congress
that
passed
the
statute
and
that
is
the
intent
we
are
going
for
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
legislative
history.
we,
on
the
other
hand,
rely
upon
primarily
the
preamble
to
senate
bill
30,
which
was
1963,
became
1963,
which
expressly
limits
the
forfeiture
of
interest
in
an
enterprise.
also,
the
senate
reports
and
house
reports
which
were
the
synopses
and
the
explanations
that
were
given
to
the
senators
and
the
congressmen
when
they,
in
fact,
were
required
to
vote
on
the
statute.
when
they
said,
what
is
this
all
about,
that
is
what
they
were
looking
at.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
well,
both
of
us
rely
initially
on
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
both
submit
that
the
express
wording
supports
their
respective
positions.
needless
to
say,
unfortunately,
it
can't,
so
obviously
there
is
a
conflict
and
the
question
of
what
the
expression
is.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
that
is
when
both
sides
go
to
the
secondary.
obviously,
the
express
wording
is
of
primary
concern
and
the
legislative
history
is
really
a
secondary
source
of
interpretation.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
well,
there
are
primarily
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
question
is
a
policy
determination
that
really
needs
to
be
addressed
by
congress
and
i
believe
has
been
addressed.
and,
that
is
a
question
of
we
have
now
punished
the
racketeer
by
throwing
him
in
jail.
we
have
punished
the
racketeer
by
separating
him
from
his
office
in
the
enterprise
and
separating
him
from
his
interest
in
the
enterprise.
we
have
now
fined
the
individual.
now,
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
forfeiture
aspect.
who
is
it
that
we
wish
to
protect?
who
should
be
the
benefactor
of
the
forfeiture?
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
of
course,
it
was.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
well,
again,
there
are
two
answers.
the
first
one
is
that
it
still
is
forfeitable.
not
only
is
it
forfeitable
under
civil
law,
it
is
subject
to
treble
damages.
i
believe
it
was
a
question
of
policy
of
if
we
are
going
to
take
the
criminal
out
of
the
enterprise,
who
should
get
the
benefit
of
the
forfeiture?
should
it
be
the
government
or
the
victim?
that
is
one
answer.
the
other
one
is
a
little
bit
more
technical
and,
unfortunately,
it
is
supposition
since
no
one
can
really
tell.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
one
of
the
problems
that
congress
had
was
that
when
they
passed
the
first
united
states
in
personam
forfeiture
action,
they
were
most
concerned
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
act.
and,
i
believe
that
when
they
sent...
particularly
senator
mcclellan
requested
attorney
general
kleindienst
to
answer
the
question
of
the
constitutionality.
now
we
are
getting
into
the
kleindeinst
letter.
i
believe
this
is
one
of
the
true
reasons
and
importances
of
the
kleindienst
letter.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
it
was
a
predecessor
of
the
1963,
however,
the
importance
of
the
statute...
of
the
letter
at
this
juncture
is
that
when
congress
said,
is
it
constitutional,
kleindeinst
responded,
yes,
it
is
constitutional
as
limited,
as
limited
to
interest
in
the
enterprise,
and
as
limited
so
that
no
other
property
is
subject
to
forfeiture.
i
think
it
really
came
down
to
a
very
simply
question.
congress
was
afraid
that
if
they
extended
the
forfeiture
beyond
the
limitations
which
were
imposed
by
that
letter
that
they
would
be
getting
into
an
area
of
constitutional
dimension.
and,
in
order
to
avoid
it,
they
went
into
the
civil
remedies
and
the
civil
treble
damage
forfeitures
that
were
provided.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
kleindeinst
letter
that
i
believe
is
important.
the
importance
of
the
kleindeinst
letter
is
not
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
it
is
limited,
forfeitures
are
limited
to
an
interest
in
an
enterprise,
because
as
your
honor
correctly
pointed
out,
that
applied
to
a
prior
forfeiture
proceeding.
the
importance
of
it
is
that
it
was
included
in
senate
bill
30
in
the
preamble
to
show
the
intent
of
the
senate
in
passing
the
bill,
the
intent
of
the
limitation
being
there.
so,
it
is
congress'
intent
by
using
the
letter
in
their
preamble
and
referring
to
it
that
is
important,
not
the
attorney
general's
personal
opinion.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
unfortunately,
i
am
not
a
grammarian,
however,
several
of
the
lower
courts
have
so
indicated
that
that
limitation
does
apply
across-the-board,
if
not
expressly
as
an
indication
of
the
intent
of
the
entire
section.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
it
is
not
a
question
of
being
narrower
or
not.
i
believe
that
the
government's
interpretation
would
make
one
narrower
than
the
other.
i
believe
they
actually
go
to
different
things.
for
example,
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
situation
where
an
individual
is
involved
in
a
racketeering
situation
and
he
has
interest
in
an
enterprise
that
is
less
than
of
substantial
source
of
influence
over
the
enterprise.
that
would
not
be
subject
to
forfeiture
under
(a)(2),
yet
that
certainly
is
not
the
intend
of
congress.
the
intent
of
congress
is
to
totally
separate
them
from
the
legitimate
enterprise
entirely.
that
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture
under
(a)(1).
there
are
other
things
that
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture
under
(a)(1)
that
would
not
be
subject
under
(a)(2).
for
example,
in
the
godoy
case
out
of
the
9th
circuit,
the
profits
and
proceeds
were
then
reinvested
as
part
of
the
enterprise
into
investment
property.
that
was
subject
to
forfeiture
under
(a)(1).
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
(a)(2)
primarily
would
reach
not
only
interest
in
the
enterprise
which
give
a
source
of
influence,
which
would
also
be
arguably
be
covered
under
(a)(1),
but
it
also
allows
the
forfeiture
of
the
securities,
the
claims,
property
contractual
rights,
all
of
which
are
a
form
of
influence
that
arguably
is
not
subject
to
forfeiture
under
(a)(1).
i
think
it
is
not
really
a
question
of
is
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)...
let's
categorize
them
separately.
it
is
a
question
of
why
are
they
there?
in
the--
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
--of
course,
your
honor.
initially
they
did
have
it
all
in
one
sentence
as
a
matter
of
fact.
(a)(1)
was
the
initial
sentence.
congress
then
ran
into
a
problem,
i
would
submit,
in
thereafter
they
passed
the
modification
of
1962(a)
where
they
included
the
one
percent
exception.
and,
i
agree
with
the
government.
that
does
not
make
it
not
forfeitable.
however,
congress
was
afraid
that
someone
might
so
interpret
it
and
to
avoid
that
possibility
they
more
fully
set
forth
the
different
categories
that
now
make
up
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
of
1963
which
was
not
there
before.
actually
though
it
attempted
to
make
it
a
little
bit
more
difficult
to
understand.
i
think
their
intent
really
was
to
try
to
simplify
it
and
they
just
didn't
succeed
unfortunately.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
believe
(a)(1)
was
the
original,
the
original--
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
--that
is
correct.
that
is
(a)(1).
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
excuse
me,
let
me
rephrase
that.
the
original
was
actually...
i
apologize.
there
was
a
modification
of
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2).
the
original
was
interest
in
an
enterprise.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
which
they
did
not
then
separate
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form.
then
they
broke
it
down
into
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2).
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
and,
i
would
submit
that
they
are
in
(a)(2)
for
the
express
purpose
of
modifying
the
other
sections
of
(a)(2)
which
were
not
in
the
predecessor
proposed
statute.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
this
is
where
i
disagree
with
some
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
ruled
in
my
favor.
i
absolutely
believe
that
1963(a)(1)
will
reach
an
enterprising
fact
under
1962(c).
godoy,
i
think,
is
a
perfect
example
of
that
or
actually,
to
be
most
honest,
this
case,
but
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal,
would
have
been
a
perfect
example
of
that.
in
this
case,
the
individual
was
charged
primarily
with
being
involved
in
a
racketeering
situation
where
he,
along
with
others,
purchased
property...
in
his
case,
he
already
had
the
property...
donated
the
property
to
the
enterprise,
got
it
insured,
burned
it,
took
the
proceeds.
what
would
be
forfeitable
in
this
case,
but
for
the
judgment
of
acquittal
that
was
granted
below,
would
be
the
property,
because
the
property
was
donated
to
the
purpose,
to
serve
the
purpose
of
the
enterprise.
this
is
an
example
of
a
1962(c)
violation
or
something
that
would
be
forfeitable
under
1963(a)(1).
so,
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
lower
courts,
even
the
ones
that
decided
in
my
favor,
limitation,
that
1962(c)
does
not
apply
to
the
forfeiture
of
(a)(1).
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
the
property
would
have
been
forfeitable
because
it
was
donated
and
used
by
the
enterprise,
yes,
sir.
i
think
one
of
the
important
things
to
take
into
consideration
here
is
the
fact
we
are
going
into
the
area
of
policy
determination.
should
it
or
should
it
not
be
forfeitable?
i
would
agree
with
the
government
wholeheartedly--
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
--exactly
the
opposite.
my
next
sentence
was
going
to
be
that
policy
determination
should
not
be
made
here;
that
what
we
are
doing
here
is
interpreting
the
words
of
the
statute
and
that
is
what
we
are
limited
to.
the
only
thing
that
i
am
trying
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
from
a
policy
standpoint
is
the
fact
that
even
congress
across
the
street
doesn't
know
really
what
it
wants
to
do.
the
purpose
of
including
in
the
brief
a
number
of
house
bills
and
senate
bills
that
have
come
up
for
consideration
after
the
passage
of
1963
is
to
not
to
show
what
congress'
intent
was
back
in
1970.
obviously,
that
is
impossible.
what
it
is
to
show
is
the
importance
of
the
policy
decision
which
congress
should
be
making
and
even
they
at
this
point
don't
know
which
way
they
want
to
go.
the
reason
they
don't
know
is,
number
one,
the
question
of
the
constitutionality;
and,
number
two,
the
question
of
who
should
benefit
from
the
forfeiture.
are
society's
need
sufficiently
met
by
throwing
the
racketeer
in
jail,
giving
him
a
fine,
and
separating
him
from
the
enterprise,
and
giving
treble
damages
to
the
victims,
or
do
we
also
need
additional
forfeiture?
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
personally
i
don't
see
one.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
personally
i
think
they
have
every
right
to
do
it,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
no.
what
i
basically
meant
is...
going
back
to
1970
i
think
it
was
a
policy
determination,
because
they
didn't
know
being
the
first
type
statute
that
went
in
personam.
they
didn't
know
whether
it
was
going
to
be
declared
constitutional
or
not
and
they
were
trying
to
limit
their
actions
by
the
limitations
that
the
attorney
general
had
given
them.
i
think
the
policy
determination
now,
which
congress
ultimately
is
going
to
have
to
make,
is
strictly
a
question
of
which
way
are
we
going
to
go
or
both
ways?
is
it
going
to
be
a
forfeiture
to
the
government?
is
there
going
to
be
treble
damages
to
the
victim
so
that
his
business,
his
enterprise,
can
get
back
on
its
feet
once
the
racketeer
has
been
removed
or
it
is
best
served
by
doing
both?
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
it
absolutely
should
not
concern
this
court,
your
honor,
absolutely
should
not.
it
is
a
decision
that
should
be
made
across
the
street.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
respond
to
two
things
in
particular
that
possibly
were
not
discussed
in
the
affirmative
argument.
one
question
is
what
exactly
is
the
difference
and
the
purpose
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
versus
in
rem
forfeiture
jurisdiction?
the
reason
that
they
went
over
to
in
personam
jurisdiction
is
twofold.
number
one,
unlike
in
rem
jurisdiction,
it
allows
for
the
immediate
and
mandatory
forfeiture,
totally
non-discretionary.
in
rem,
you
have
independent
lawsuits,
independent
parties
involved.
more
importantly,
the
reason
that
it
was
in
personam
is
so
that
the
1963
forfeiture
could
serve
its
purpose
and
go
to
things
that
were
normally
not
forfeitable,
that
are
not
in
rem.
i
think
the
case
of
united
states
versus
rubin
is
the
perfect
example
of
this.
the
government
wanted
the
racketeer
out
the
union,
out
of
the
enterprise.
to
do
this,
the
5th
circuit
said,
all
right,
it
is
subject...
the
office
is
subject
to
forfeiture.
that
is
not
in
rem.
it
has
to
be
in
personam.
that
is
the
reason
for
the
in
personam
jurisdiction.
it
is
all
well
and
good
for
the
government
to
say
that
we
think
profits
should
be
forfeitable.
we
believe
that
it
is
an
effective
weapon.
that
is
not
what
we
are
here
to
discuss.
what
we
are
here
to
discuss
is
whether
it
does
or
does
not
fall
under
the
statute
as
written.
for
example,
the
government
has
gone
down
and
listed
a
number
of
things
that
they
believe
are
subject
to
forfeiture
under
rico
which
only
has
as
its
fruits,
if
you
will--
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
--it
is.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
the
secondary
sources
certainly
are
illustrative.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
well,
there
is
a
question
of
what
level.
i
believe
that
the
statements
of
congressmen
and
senators
on
the
floor
really
isn't
secondary,
it
is
almost
in
the
third
position.
what
we
are
relying
upon
is
the
exact
wording
of
the
bills...
of
the
preamble
of
the
bill
and
the
reports
which
is
what
the
congressmen
had
in
front
of
them
as
their
understanding
of
the
statute
when
they
were
voting
on
the
issue.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
we
would
submit
that
we
do.
one
of
the
things
that
is
interesting
is
the
government
talks
about
the
history
of
the
last
15
years,
how
now,
because
forfeitures
are
so
run-of-the-mill,
we
can
interpret
them
as
broadly
as
we
possibly
want.
however,
none
of
those
were
on
the
books
in
1970
when
the
issue
of
the
intent
of
congress
actually
came
into
being,
the
kind
of
after-the-fact.
i
think
one
of
the
important
things
though
is
what
really
was
the
purpose
of
the
racketeering
statute?
the
purpose
of
the
statute...
and
i
don't
think
there
is
really
any
argument
on
this...
is
to
get
the
racketeer
out
of
the
enterprise,
to
allow
the
enterprise
to
live
independent
of
the
racketeering
and
to
survive.
very
simply
stated,
unless
the
profits
and
proceeds
are
put
back
into
an
enterprise,
it
falls
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
have
1962(a).
that
is
what
provides
for
the
substantive
crime
and
ultimately
the
forfeiture
when
there
is
a
plowing
back
into
an
enterprise
of
illegally
obtained
interest
and
proceeds.
if
the
interest
and
proceeds
are
not
put
back
into
the
enterprise...
though
it
may
very
well
be
that
congress
would
love
to
get
those
profits
and
proceeds...
it
goes
outside
the
purpose
and
scope
of
the
racketeering
statute.
mr.
ronald
a.
dion
there
is
no
question
that
was
their
stated
purpose.
however,
at
the
same
time,
we
take
a
look
at
what
are
the
underlying
crimes.
the
government
basically
says
we
have
got
to
go
after
profits
and
proceeds
as
a
forfeiture
of
all
the
underlying
crimes.
if
we
look
at
the
list
of
underlying
crimes,
congress
has
not
provided
for
forfeiture
of
the
underlying
substantive
crimes
in
many
cases.
gambling,
prostitution
and
murder,
for
example,
have
no
forfeiture
provisions
attached
to
them.
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
would
suggest
that
the
scope
and
purpose
of
rico
is
getting
the
criminal
out
of
the
enterprise
and
that
under
that
interpretation
the
statute
can
be
read
as
expressly
worded
without
a
provision
for
the
forfeiture
of
income,
profits,
and
proceeds.
