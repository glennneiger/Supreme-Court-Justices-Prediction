mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
o'connor
observed,
congress'
stated
objective
in
enacting
the
rico
statute
was
nothing
less
than
"eradication
of
organized
crime"
by,
among
other
things,
providing
enhanced
sanctions
and
new
remedies.
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
the
preface
to
the
rico
statute
congress,
the
entire
congress
stated
that
its
objective
was
to
do
this
and
found
"that
organized
crime
in
the
united
states
is
a
highly
sophisticated,
diversified,
and
widespread
activity
that
annually
drains
billions
of
dollars
of
america's
economy
by
unlawful
conduct
and
the
illegal
use
of
force,
fraud,
and
corruption.
"
organized
crime
derives
a
major
portion
of
its
power
through
money
obtained
through
such
illegal
endeavors
as
syndicated
gambling,
loansharking,
the
theft
and
fencing
of
property,
the
importation
and
distribution
of
narcotics
and
other
dangerous
drugs,
and
other
forms
of
social
exploitation.
given
congress'
objective
and
its
finding,
it
would
have
been
surprising
is
congress
had
enacted
a
racketeering
forfeiture
statute,
but
had
held
back
from
authorizing
the
forfeiture
of
the
illegal
profits
that
constitute
organized
crime's
life
blood
and
the
source
of
its
wealth
and
power.
neither
petitioner
nor
the
dissent
in
the
court
below
nor
any
court
or
commentator
has
been
able
to
identify
any
convincing
reason
why
congress
might
not
have
wanted
to
authorize
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits.
certainly
there
is
nothing
harsh
or
unfair
about
doing
so,
about
requiring
a
convicted
criminal
to
give
up
his
illegal
gain.
in
this
case,
for
example,
petitioner
obtained
some
$340,000
in
insurance
proceeds
by
taking
out
fire
insurance
on
his
property
and
arranging
for
an
arsonist
to
burn
it
down.
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
be
permitted
to
keep
that
money.
what
reasons
as
petitioner
suggested
this
morning--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
is
right,
justice,
stevens,
but
there
is
no
contradiction
there.
under
1963(c)
the
attorney
general
is
directed
to
dispose
of
forfeited
property,
making
due
provision
for
the
rights
of
innocent
persons.
and,
under
the
procedures
that
are
incorporated
into
rico,
a
victim
of
racketeering
can
apply
to
the
attorney
general
to
receive
the
forfeited
property
and
can
receive
that
property.
so
there
is
no
contradiction.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
correct
and
that
is
of
considerable
benefit
to
the
victims.
it
spares
them
the
trouble
and
expense
of
bringing
suit
and
it
also
spares
them
the
unpleasant
prospect
of
having
to
square
off
in
court
against
the
defendant
who
may
be
a
notorious
racketeer.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
congress
intended--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
congress
intended
for
both
of
those
remedies
to
be
available
and
they
both
serve--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--no,
the
government
simply
gets
the
forfeiture.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
think
they
are
independent
procedures.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that
is
not
settled,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
think
perhaps
the
money
received
from
the
government
would
be
taken
into
account
in
computing
the
victim's
damages.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
not
resolved
and
certainly
isn't
the
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
one
critical
difference
between
the
two
provisions
is
that
under
(a)(1),
as
we
read
that
statute,
the
interest
must
be
illegally
obtained.
it
is
an
interest
acquired
or
maintained
in
violation
of
section
1962.
under
1963(a)(2),
the
interest
may
not...
it
need
not
be
illegally
obtained.
it
may
be
a
lawfully
acquired
interest
in
an
enterprise
that
the
defendant
has
established,
conducted,
controlled,
or
participated
in
in
violation
of
the
rico
statute.
1963(a)(1)
is
really
the
less
controversial
provision
of
the
forfeiture
statute,
because
it
talks
about
illegally
obtained
interest.
1963(a)(2)
goes
further
and
takes
interest
that
may
be
lawfully
obtained
but
have
been
associated
with
an
enterprise
that
has
been
found
to
be
unlawful.
and,
that
goes
to--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--justice
stevens,
if
maintained
is
read
in
that
broad
way,
i
am
not
aware
of
judicial
authority
for
that
proposition.
then
they
may
overlap
to
a
substantial
extent,
but
it
is
not
at
all
obvious
to
me
that
maintained
means
exactly
that.
maintained
means
any
interest
in
enterprise
that
has
found
to
be
unlawful.
it
could
be
read
much
more
narrowly
to
talk
about
an
interest
that
has
been
sustained
by
racketeering
activity
in
the
sense
that
only
through
that
racketeering
activity
was
the
interest
permitted
to
survive.
your
reading
is
certainly
a
possible
one,
but
i
don't
know...
it
certainly
isn't
settled
if
that
is
what
congress
intended.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that
if
someone
had
a
lawful
business
and
fell
upon
financial
hard
times
and
turned
to
racketeering
to
keep
the
business
going
or,
as
a
sideline,
to
make
extra
profit,
that
would
clearly
be
an
interest
that
is
forfeitable
under
(a)(2).
it
is
much
less
clear
that
that
would
be
reached
by
(a)(1).
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
know
that
that
is
a
necessary
reading
of
(a)(1).
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
in
(a)(1)
and
(a)(2)
congress
was
not
crafting
pieces
of
a
puzzle
that
fit
together
neatly.
i
think
congress
was
attempting
to
cover
the
field
as
it
was
in
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
rico
statute.
so,
there
is
a
considerable
overlap
in
these
provisions.
i
don't
think
anyone,
although
they
have
tried
mightily
has
succeeded
in
construing
the
two
provisions
in
such
a
way
that
they
interlock
with
no
overlap.
i
think
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
overlap.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
certainly
(a)(2)
covers...
yes,
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
certainly
true.
(a)(1)
covers--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
under
our
interpretation,
(a)(1)
covers
any
interest
whether
or
not
in
an
enterprise
and
(a)(2)
is
limited
to
interest
in
an
enterprise
and
i
think
that
is
what
congress
clearly
intended.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
(a)(1),
as
i
have
said,
covers
any
interest
as
that
term
has
been
defined
in
common
use.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
(a)--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
is
true
unless
you
mean...
unless
you
read
into
the
word
(a)(2)
and
i
don't
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
one
may
have
an
interest
in
a
lawful
enterprise
and
they
use
that
enterprise
to
facilitate
racketeering
activity.
and,
it
may
be
that
the
racketeering
activity
does
not
further
the
enterprise,
but
the
enterprise
furthers
the
racketeering
activity.
that
results
in
a
forfeiture
under
(a)(2)
and
would
not
fall
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
(a)(1).
petitioner
suggested
this
morning
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
congress
held
back
from
authorizing
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits
was
because
they
entertained
some
constitutional
doubts
about
their
ability
to
do
so.
he
quickly
concedes
that
he
doesn't
see
any
constitutional
problem
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
this
provision
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute,
upon
which
he
relied
and
which
was
enacted
during
the
same
term
of
congress,
authorized
the
forfeiture
of
illegal
income
derived
from
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
engaged
in
drug
activities.
in
passing
that
statute,
congress
had
no
constitutional
doubts,
so
it
is
farfetched,
i
would
suggest,
to
argue
that
congress
had
unexpressed
constitutional
doubts
of
very
dubious
validity
about
authorizing
the
forfeiture
of
the
rico
statute.
he
argued
that
congress
may
have
held
back
in
authorizing
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits
because
they
thought
that
the
civil
remedies
were
enough,
but
this
is
unconvincing
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
in
many
case,
narcotics,
gambling,
prostitution,
there
may
be
no
identifiable
victims
to
come
forward
and
bring
civil
suit
and
the
result
is
that
the
racketeer
gets
to
keep
his
illegal
gain
even
though
he
has
been
convicted
of
participating
in
a
criminal
offense.
the
only
argument
he
raised
in
his
brief
and
the
only
argument
that
was
raised
by
the
dissent
below
for
why
congress
might
not
have
wanted
to
authorize
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits
is
that
our
society,
he
says,
is
traditionally
abhored
in
personam
forfeitures.
but,
this
argument
is
not
good
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
i
said,
whatever
attitudes
were
in
the
past,
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
congress
that
passed
the
rico
statute
did
not
abhor
in
personam
forfeiture
because
it
enacted
an
in
personam
statute,
both
in
rico
and
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute.
the
rico
provision
that
is
not
challenged
here,
1963(a)(2),
authorizes
the
forfeiture
of
interests
that
may
have
been
lawfully
obtained
and,
therefore,
that
is
a
far
more
extreme
position
than
the
forfeiture
of
illegally
obtained
gains.
it
is
not
disputed
that
congress
wanted
to
do
that.
the
second
reason
why
this
argument
is
not
convincing
is
that
it
simply
is
not
true
in
personam
have
been
historically
disfavored.
what
was
outlawed
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
first
congress
was
a
particular
harsh
type
of
in
personam
forfeiture,
what
was
known
in
common
law
as
forfeiture
by
attainder
under
which
the
convicted
felon
was
pronounced
legally
dead
and
he
lost
all
of
his
property
and
he
lost
the
right
to
transmit
property
to
his
heirs.
now,
just
because
that
was
felt
to
be
too
harsh,
it
certainly
doesn't
follow
that
the
same
is
true
of
all
in
personam
forfeiture.
on
the
contrary,
in
personam
forfeiture
is
really
less
harsh
than
in
rem
forfeiture
because
it
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
the
government
must
satisfy
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
in
rem
forfeiture--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
but,
i
understand
petitioner
to
be
drawing
a
much
mor
subtle
distinction
between
in
personam
and
in
rem
forfeitures.
and,
i
think
the
argument
that
our
society
has
traditionally
view
in
personam
forfeitures
as
harsher
and,
therefore,
has
disfavored
them
as
simply
not
valid.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
may
not
be
a
bright
line,
but
taking
the
extreme
cases,
there
certainly
is
a
distinction.
in
rem
is
a
proceeding
against
the
forfeited
object
itself
and
it
doesn't
require
proof
of
the
owner's
fault.
it
may
result
in
the
forfeiture
in
some
cases
of
lawfully
obtained
property
that
was
used
on
a
particular
occasion
for
an
illegal
purpose,
even
without
the
owner's
knowledge
or
consent,
a
boat
that
was
used
to
import
drugs
or
smuggle
goods.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
exactly
my
point.
i
think
it
is
at
least
as
harsh,
in
many
ways
much
harsher,
than
the
in
personam
forfeiture
that
is
involved
here
and
simply
results
in
a
personal
judgment
against
the
defendant.
my
point
is
that
is
not
to
venture
into
the
area
of
policy
whether
it
is
socially
desirable
to
forfeit
racketeering
profits.
my
point
is
that
no
one
has
been
able
to
suggest
why
congress
might
not
have
wanted
to
do
this
and
with
that
in
mind
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
of
rico,
both
of
which
demonstrate
that
congress
did
quite
clearly
intend
to
authorize
forfeiture
of
interest
such
as
those
involved
in
this
case.
now,
of
course,
the
starting
point,
as
petitioner
observed,
is
the
language
of
1963(a)(1)
itself
which
calls
for
the
forfeiture
of
any
interest
in
an
enterprise.
excuse
me,
of
any
interest
acquired
or
maintained
in
violation
of
1962,
not
an
interest
in
enterprise,
any
interest.
and,
profits
obtained
from
racketeering
fall
squarely
within
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute.
petitioner
contests
this
on
the
grounds
that
an
interest
means
an
interest
in
something.
but,
that
usage
is
only
employed
to
draw
distinction
between
the
interest
which
is
a
bundle
of
rights,
and
the
thing
to
which
the
interest
applies,
so
that
racketeering
profits
are
clearly
an
interest
in
something.
they
are
in
interest
in
cash,
in
a
bank
account,
in
cd's
or
the
like.
if
the
language
of
1963(a)(1)
is
not
clear
enough,
then
the
contrast
with
1963(a)(2)
is
really
dispositive.
1963(a)(1)
talks
about
any
interest.
1963(a)(2)
talks
about
an
interest
in
an
enterprise.
when
congress
places
a
limitation
like
that
in
one
subsection
and
omits
it
from
another,
the
inference
is
virtually
inescapable
that
they
did
so
for
a
purpose.
and,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
convincing
explanation
to
suggest,
as
petitioner
did
here,
that
congress
simply
wanted
to
say
"inc".
and
did
not
want
to
have
to
include
the
modifying
terms,
in
an
enterprise,
in
1963(a)(1).
our
interpretation
is
also
supported
by
the
rico
statute's
definition
of
the
term
"enterprise",
which
is
not
limited
to
legal
entities,
but
also
extends
to
wholly
illegitimate
ones
as
this
court
held
in
turkette.
since
congress
wanted
to
attack
these
enterprises,
it
would
not
make
sense
for
it
to
limit
its
forfeiture
provision
in
such
as
way
as
to
make
it
ineffectual
in
doing
so.
yet,
in
a
case
of
an
illegitimate
enterprise,
there
were
usually
no
interest
in
the
enterprise
that
can
be
forfeited.
they
usually
don't
issue
stock.
so,
it
would
not
have
made
sense
for
congress
to
provide
solely
for
the
forfeiture
of
interest
in
an
enterprise
and
not
income
which
is
the
source
of
organized
crime's
power.
petitioner
relies
on
the
use
of
the
term
1962(a),
one
of
the
prohibitory
provisions,
and
states
that
if
congress
intended
to
require
the
forfeiture
of
income
in
1963(a)(1),
it
would
have
used
the
term
"income"
there.
well,
i
hardly
think
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
the
term
"income"
was
in
congress'
vocabulary.
it
knew
the
term,
but
it
had
a
good
reason
for
using
a
different
term
in
1963(a)(1),
because
while
that
provisions
reaches
income,
it
is
not
limited
to
income.
it
includes
many
other
types
of
real
and
personal
property
and
other
things
that
afford
sources
of
wealth
and
control.
the
alternative
to
using
the
broad
less
specific
term
1963(a)(1)
would
have
been
an
enumeration
of
all
the
things
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
the
issue
here,
of
course,
is
just
the
proceeds,
but
we
would
contend
that
it
reaches
any
type
of
real
or
personal
property.
and,
as
petitioner
himself
suggested,
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
it
reaches
other
things
such
as
offices
and
companies
and
labor
unions
and
positions
that
permit
a
racketeer
to
control
a
business
or
another
organization.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
proceeds
that
petitioner
received
from
insurance
companies
when
he
submitted
a
fraudulent
claim
on
the
property
that
he
himself
arranged
to
have
burned
down.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
is
cash,
$140,000.
in
a
somewhat
related
argument,
petitioner
relies
on
the
contemporaneously
enacted
provision
of
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statue
which,
as
i
said,
authorizes
the
forfeiture
of
illegal
income
derived
from
the
kinds
of
enterprises
with
which
that
statute
is
concerned.
but,
although
it
is
true
that
these
two
provisions
were
contemporaneously
enacted,
they
are
really
the
handiwork
of
different
congressional
committees,
and,
thus,
it
is
not
clear
their
language
was
placed
under
a
microscope
and
compared.
moreover,
the
language
is
fully
consistent.
in
the
c.c.e.
statute,
congress
was
concerned
with
a
single,
narrow
type
of
enterprise,
an
enterprise
that
is
engaged
in
drug
activities.
these
enterprises
usually
generate
large
cash
profits
and
there
usually
is
not
an
interest
in
the
enterprise
that
can
be
forfeited.
so,
congress
used
the
narrow
term
"income".
in
rico,
congress
was
concerned
with
a
different
problem
with
a
vast
variety
of
enterprises
and
with
more
than
30
specific
kinds
of
enumerated
criminal
conduct.
so,
it
used
the
broader
term
"interest".
moreover,
if
it
is
true,
as
petitioner
suggests,
that
congress
carefully
compared
these
two
provisions,
that
supports
our
argument
and
not
his.
as
i
said,
no
one
has
suggested
any
reason
why
congress
might
not
have
wanted
to
authorize
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits.
the
only
possible
explanation
is
mere
oversight.
and,
alerted
by
the
c.c.e.
provision
to
the
availability
of
this
potent
weapon,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
suggest
that
congress
would
have
omitted
it
from
the
rico
statute
without
at
least
some
discussion
or
debate
if
that
is
what
petitioner's
position
must
be.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
certainly
true,
justice
stevens,
but
where
congress
does
something
that
is
fully
consistent
with
its
intent,
i
think
that
is
less
in
need
of
an
explanation
than
when
congress
is
charged
with
doing
something
that
runs
directly
counter
to
its
broad
intent
and
that
is
what
petitioner--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
we
don't
argue
that
his
reading
renders
them
completely
redundant.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
our
reading
doesn't
render
them
completely
redundant.
as
i
said,
these
things
were
intended
to
occupy
the
field
and
not
really
to
interlock.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
one
of
the
problems
with
his
reading
and
another
major
problem
with
his
reading,
beyond
the
plain
language
of
rico,
is
the
legislative
history.
there
are
three
points
i
would
make
about
the
legislative
history
very
quickly.
first,
there
are
numerous
places
in
the
legislative
history
where
sponsors
and
principal
advocates
of
rico,
not
just
any
congressman,
but
the
congressmen
who
were
responsible
for
drafting
this
bill
and
getting
it
enacted,
stated
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
forfeiture
provision
was
to
take
away
racketeers'
illegal
gain.
in
the
senate,
senator
mcclellan,
who
was
probably
the
chief
sponsor
of
the
bill,
stated
that
rico
"would
forfeit
the
ill-gotten
gain
of
criminals
where
the
enter
or
operate
an
organization
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity.
"
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that
is
what
ill-gotten
gains
means.
it
means
illegal
profit.
it
certainly
doesn't
mean...
that
certainly
is
a
much
more
reasonable
reading
than
to
say
that
it
means
a
lawfully
acquired
interest
in
an
enterprise
that
has
been
used
to
further
a
criminal
purpose.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
it
is
less
specific
than
we
might
have
hoped,
but
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
approximation
of
our
argument.
and,
this
is
not
a
single,
isolated
statement.
there
are
many
statements
in
the
debate
to
that
effect
and
they
illicited
no
opposition
or
inquiries
from
other
members
of
congress
suggesting
that
maybe
they
shouldn't
go
that
far.
representative
poth,
to
give
just
one
more
example,
who
was
perhaps
the
statute's
chief
advocate
in
the
house,
said
after
conviction
the
ill-gotten
gains
must
be
forfeited
to
the
government.
and,
the
house
report
stated
that
the
forfeiture
provision
extends
"to
all
property
and
interests
as
broadly
defined
which
are
related
to
the
violation.
"
and,
as
i
said,
there
are
other
statements
to
this
effect.
the
second
point
is,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
that
forfeiting
racketeering
profits
is
entirely
consistent
with
congress'
broad
intent.
and,
there
are
many
specific
problems
that
congress
was
concerned
with
during
the
congressional
debates
that
virtually
cry
out
for
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits.
one
example
are
illegal
businesses
that
organized
crime
has
dominated
like
narcotics
and
gambling
where
there
are
no
interests
in
the
enterprise
that
can
be
taken
in
forfeiture,
but
striking
at
the
illegal
profits
really
gets
at
the
heart
of
the
matter.
and,
another
was
the
practice
of
taking
over
a
legitimate
business,
skimming
off
profits
and
leaving
it
bankrupt.
forfeiting
and
interest
in
the
bankrupt
shell
would
not
do
any
good,
but
taking
the
illegal
profits
that
are
drained
off
the
business
would
be
an
effective
remedy.
the
third
point
that
emerges
from
the
legislative
history
is
it
is
certainly
true,
as
petitioner
points
out,
that
there
are
statements
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
forfeiture
provision
results
in
the
forfeiture
of
interests
in
an
enterprise.
but,
none
of
the
statements,
addressed
to
the
finally
enacted
version
of
rico,
states
that
the
forfeiture
provision
is
limited
to
these
interests.
these
are
merely
illustrative
and
not
exhaustive.
and,
as
to
the
letter
from
deputy
attorney
general
kleindeinst
upon
which
petitioner
relies,
this
addressed
an
earlier
version
of
the
rico
statute
that
was
limited
to
interest
in
an
enterprise,
so
it
really
sheds
no
light
on
what
the
finally
enacted
and
amended
version
means.
this
letter
was
quoted
and
cited
in
the
senate
report
because
of
its
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
forfeiture
of
interest
in
an
enterprise.
and,
the
point
that
mr.
kleindeinst
was
making
was
there
isn't
a
constitutional
problem
when
the
forfeited
interest
is
one
in
an
enterprise
that
was
involved
in
the
violation
and
not
simply
an
enterprise
that
the
convicted
person
happened
to
have.
in
conclusion,
the
forfeiture
of
racketeering
profits
is
an
extremely
important
weapon
in
the
on-going
battle
against
organized
crime.
the
plain
language
of
rico
and
the
legislative
history
show
with
some
certainty
that
congress
intended
to
acquire
the
forfeiture
of
such
proceeds
and
we,
therefore,
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
