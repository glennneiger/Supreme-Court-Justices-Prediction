mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
an
arrangement
by
which
a
hospital
obtains
full-time
services
of
four
anesthesiologists
in
exchange
for
a
promise
not
to
admit
others
to
practice
there
is
a
tying
unlawful
per
se
under
the
sherman
act.
the
first
contract
was
signed
in
1971
when
east
jefferson
general
hospital
opened.
dr.
roux
pledged
to
work
full
time
in
the
hospital
for
a
year.
the
hospital
pledged
to
give
him
all
of
the
hospital
business.
the
contract
also
called
for
dr.
roux
to
hire,
fire,
supervise
and
train
the
nurse
anesthetists
at
the
hospital
and
to
run
the
hospital's
department
of
anesthesia.
the
contract
was
extended
year
by
year
until
1976
when
a
new
five-year
agreement
was
signed.
by
the
time
of
trial
roux
and
associations,
four
anesthesiologists,
were
supervising
14
operating
rooms.
respondent
attacked
this
arrangement
as
a
tying
because
a
patient
could
not
use
the
hospital's
operating
rooms
without
taking
one
of
the
hospital's
anesthesiologists.
after
a
trial
the
district
court
held
for
the
hospital.
the
court
concluded
that
the
hospital
faced
competition
from
many
other
local
hospitals
and
could
not
charge
a
monopoly
premium
for
its
services
without
driving
patients
away
plus
it
found
no
market
power
or
any
other
source
of
dominance,
and
it
held
that
under
the
rule
of
reason
the
contract
is
pro-competitive,
beneficial
and
lawful.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed.
it
found
that
operating
rooms
and
anesthesia
are
separate
products,
and
then
it
concluded
that
although
the
market
is
not
concentrated
and
although
under
traditional
standards
of
market
power...
there
would
be
none
in
this
case...
the
arrangement
nonetheless
was
unlawful
per
se
because
of
generic
imperfections
in
the
market
for
medical
services.
the
court
of
appeals
observed
that
many
patients
are
insured.
many
patients
would
like
to
use
hospitals
near
their
home
and
that
there
is
a
lack
of
perfect
information
in
the
market.
consequently
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
hospital
had
market
power
and
the
per
se
rule
against
tyings
applied.
when
the
court
turned
to
the
hospital's
arguments
about
pro-competitive
benefits
from
this
arrangement,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
observed
that
because
the
per
se
rule
had
been
invoked
these
benefits
could
be
considered
only
if
this
contract
was
the
least
restrictive
alternative
to
arrange
them,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not.
the
arguments
we
make
in
our
brief
about
this
subject
really
boil
down
to
three:
no
tie,
no
market
power
and
no
enhancement
of
market
power.
i
would
like
to
take
them
up
in
that
order.
our
basic
proposition
is
that
an
arrangement
such
as
this
is
best
analyzed
as
an
exclusive
dealing
or
employment
contract
and
not
as
a
tying.
to
understand
this
you
can
think
of
a
continuum
by
which
hospital
services
can
be
arranged.
at
one
end
of
that
continuum
is
the
perfectly
open
hospital
in
which
all
qualified
professionals
may
practice.
if
8
anesthesiologists
or
14
anesthesiologists
want
to
practice
in
east
jefferson
general
hospital
they
may
do
so,
and
if
there
are
more
anesthesiologists
who
want
to
work
there
and
there
is
work
to
be
had
they
will
all
work
part
time.
that
clearly
would
be
lawful.
many
hospitals
are
operated
in
exactly
that
way.
at
the
other
end
is
group
practice
of
medicine
similar
to
the
group
health
association
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
such
a
group
practice
is
closed
on
all
sides.
all
physicians
are
under
full-time
contract.
all
medical
services
are
sold
as
a
package.
one
cannot
get
the
podiatrist
of
the
group
health
association
without
taking
its
dermatologist,
its
internal
medicine
man
and
its
radiologist.
the
only
choice
a
patient
has
when
medicine
is
practiced
as
a
group
is
to
go
with
that
group
or
to
seek
medical
care
elsewhere.
that,
too,
would
be
lawful
we
should
think.
the
court
indicated
as
much
in
maricopa.
that
is
a
plain
partnership
in
which
people
cooperate
to
produce
a
product.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
this
arrangement
resembles
each
of
these
arrangements
in
part.
this
hospital
is
organized
in
both
of
those
ways.
some
of
the
departments
at
this
hospital
are
organized
like
the
closed
panel
practice.
the
anesthesiology
department
is
so
organized.
radiology
is
so
organized.
cardiology,
nursing
services
and
many
other
services
this
hospital
provides
are
organized
in
that
way.
other
services
that
this
hospital
provides
like
internal
medicine
are
organized
in
the
first
way,
a
way
in
which
each
physician
can
participate
in
any
particular
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
justice
stevens,
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
we
would
be
able
to
see
such
an
arrangement--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--because
if
they
attempted
to
charge
a
monopoly
price
it
would
be
highly
advantageous
for
some
dentist
to
go
out
and
set
up
a
practice
and
collect
it.
but
if
in
fact
one
did
not
say
washington
but
one
said
this
is
a
very
small
town
in
which
there
is
only
one
dentist--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
there
is
an
anti-trust
problem
in
that
case,
justice
stevens.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
unless...
let
me
qualify
it,
justice
stevens.
i
think
there
would
be
a
problem
if
the
dentists
or
if
this
association
did
anything
which
had
the
effect
of
excluding
others
from
setting
up
competing
organizations,
but
if
all
you
see
is
that
one
organization
whether
it
be
a
very
large
supermarket
or
whether
it
be
a
very
large
medical
organization
provides
the
services
in
one
town
that
seems
not
troublesome
so
long
as
it
does
not
exclude
competition
by
others.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
that
would
be
perfectly
lawful,
but
one
need
not
reach
any
such
proposition
in
order
to
understand
this
case.
i
think
if
all
you
did
was
look
in
on
one
town
and
find
all
you
could
see
practicing...
there
was
one
health
maintenance
organization
of
two
internal
medicine
specialists,
one
cardiologist
and
so
on...
that
the
fact
that
there
was
just
one
group
practice
of
medicine
in
say
charlottesville,
virginia
would
not
make
that
group
practice
of
medicine
unlawful.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
what
distinguished
goldfarb
and
maricopa
on
the
one
hand,
your
honor,
from
broadcast
music
and
this
case
on
the
other
is
that
in
goldfarb
that
was
no
integration
of
any
sort.
it
was
just
a
naked
price
fixing
agreement.
those
lawyers
did
not
cooperate
in
any
way
in
the
provisions
of
services
except
to
fix
their
prices.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
exactly.
but
that
is
all
they
did.
they
did
nothing
but
fix
the
price.
in
broadcast
music--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--yes.
on
the
other
hand
in
broadcast
music
the
people
who
got
together
and
furnished
the
blanket
license
were
cooperating
in
the
creation
of
a
new
project.
they
were
behaving
exactly
as
partners
in
a
business
venture,
and
similarly
the
physicians
who
get
together
in
a
hospital
together
with
the
nurses
and
others
are
participating
in
one
business
venture
which
competes
against
other
business
ventures.
it
is
true
that
they
participate
as
partners,
charge
a
price
and
each
of
them
takes
his
share
of
that
income.
but
that
is
exactly
the
same
way
a
large
law
firm
practices
that
one
cannot
get
a
part-time
job,
for
example,
at
a
large
law
firm
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
work
part-time
at
another
law
firm
in
the
district
of
columbia.
an
arrangement
by
which
covington
and
burling
says
you
cannot
be
part-time
at
covington
and
part-time
at
wilmer,
cutler
and
pickering
would
not
be
thought
to
be
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
that
in
fact
is
what
the
hospital
has
done
here.
it
has
said
to
these
anesthesiologists
you
cannot
spend
half
of
your
time
with
our
patients
or
part
of
your
time
with
our
patients
and
part
of
your
time
with
the
patients
of
someone
else
somewhere
else.
we
want
your
full
attention
to
our
patients
full
time.
that
i
think
is
just
a
perfectly
ordinary
business
decision
quite
apart
from
a
naked
cartel.
in
fact,
on
the
question
whether
you
can
think
of
this
as
a
tying
i
think
the
initial
question
has
to
be
how
the
patients
would
perceive
what
it
is
they
are
buying.
do
they
perceive
two
separate
products
which
they
are
being
forced
to
buy
even
though
they
would
prefer
to
buy
only
one
of
them?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
district
court
made
no
findings
of
fact
on
this
other
than
to
observe
that
anesthesiology
is
ordinarily
procured
through
a
surgeon.
that
is--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--there
was
testimony
in
the
record
from
at
least
four
witnesses,
anesthesiologists
and
one
internal
medicine
specialist,
who
testified
that
that
is
the
way
in
which
anesthesia
is
ordinarily
procured.
dr.
hyde
testified
and
agreed
that
that
is
the
way
it
is
ordinarily
procured
although
he
testified
that
because
his
specialty
is
obstetric
anesthesiology
that
he
has
some
patients
who
remembered
him
and
would
like
to
be
served
by
him.
he
agreed
that--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--right.
but
he
agreed
that
in
the
run
of
cases
patients
contract
for
surgery
with
a
surgeon
and
rely
on
the
surgeon
to
procure
an
anesthesiologist.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
other
hand
without
finding
any
conclusion
of
the
district
court
clearly
erroneous
or
indeed
not
citing
anything
in
the
record
simply
stated
that
anesthesiology
and
operating
rooms
are
separate
products
which
should
be
obtainable
separately.
so
far
as
i
know
it
had
no
part
of
the
record
in
mind
when
it
made
that
statement.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
no
idea
what
it
had
in
mind
at
all.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
buyer,
however,
what
the
buyer
wants
to
obtain
in
most
cases
is
an
operation.
he
would
like
his
tonsils
taken
out
if
that
is
the
operation
he
has
in
mind
or
perhaps
open
heart
surgery.
his
interest
is
in
having
that
particular
amount
of
medical
care.
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
this
is
most
unlike
the
traditional
tying
case
of
say
when
ibm
sells
its
tabulating
machine.
someone
then
goes
into
the
market,
wants
to
procure
tabulating
cards
to
run
through
the
machine
and
puts
together
two
products
at
some
later
date.
it
is
just
nothing
that
is
put
together
at
one
later
date
in
order
to
make
an
operation.
the
operation--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--it
does.
the
hospital
during
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case...
circumstances
have
changed
slightly
since,
but
the
patient's
bill
would
contain
a
separate
line
item
for
all
anesthesia
services.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
blood,
drugs,
television
sets
in
their
room.
every
particular
medical
service
would
be
separately
billed,
and
the
reasons
for
that
is
to
reflect
what
has
been
done
for
this
patient.
if
someone
went
into
east
jefferson
general
hospital
and
never
had
an
operation
he
would
not
be
billed
for
anesthesiology.
if
he
went,
for
example,
into
traction
for
a
back
problem
no
anesthesia
charge
would
appear
on
the
bill.
the
hospital
is
attempting
to
charge
for
those
aspects
of
its
complete
spectrum
of
medical
care
that
are
provided
to
a
patient.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
were
two
charges
that
appeared,
one
of
which
would
cover
all
of
the
equipment
and
all
of
the
professional
services
whether
by
an
anesthesiologist
or
a
nurse
anesthetist
and
the
other
which
would
cover
drugs
only.
as
i
understand
the
current
arrangements
there
are
now
three
charges,
one
for
the
professional
services
of
the
anesthesiologists
and
the
nurse
anesthetists,
a
separate
charge
for
equipment
and
general
access
to
anesthesia,
and
a
third
charge
for
drugs.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
included
under
drugs.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
in
this
case,
and
i
hope
no
one
would
no
more
for
that
matter
than
one
would
argue
that
you
have
a
right
to
your
own
supplier
of
food
or
linens
in
the
hospital
also
things
for
which
you
are
apt
to
see
charges
appear
on
one's
bill.
you
go
into
a
hospital.
you
take
their
linen
service.
you
take
their
food
service.
you
take
their
nurses.
all
of
those
may
appear
as
separate
items,
but
i
would
hope
that
they
are
not
all
one
gigantic
anti-trust
conspiracy.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
procedure
at
the
time
of
the
trial
in
this
case,
your
honor...
again,
i
am
distinguishing
because
it
has
changed
slightly
since...
is
that
drugs
would
be
put
to
one
side
of
the
bill
for
professional
services,
equipment
and
so
on.
eight
percent
would
be
deducted
for
charity
and
bad
debts,
and
the
remainder,
92
percent
of
the
original
bill,
would
be
divided
50/50
between
the
hospital
which
would
cover
space,
equipment,
their
training
and
overhead
and
the
anesthesiologists.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
the
50
percent
retained
by
the
hospital
at
that
time
would
cover
the
nurse
anesthetists,
and
the
other
50
percent
separation
would
cover
the
m.d.
anesthesiologists.
the
way
the
billing
is
now
done
currently--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
embraces
in
the
context
of
hospital
service
essentially
everything
from
when
one
enters
the
hospital
and
has
laboratory
services
performed,
obtains
space
in
the
operating
room,
has
the
operation
performed
by
the
internal
medicine
specialists.
the
surgeon
will
be
attended
at
that
operation
by
a
large
number
of
nurses,
scrub
nurses,
surgical
nurses,
all
of
whom
are
employees
of
the
hospital.
he
will
then
be
wheeled
into
a
recovery
room,
provided
recovery
room
services
again
by
full-time
employees
of
the
hospital
and
some
m.d.s
and
is
finally
sent
to
his
room
and
after
that
discharged.
that
whole
package
of
services
is
we
think
one
product,
and
it
is
not
appropriate
to
attempt
to
disentangle
further
and
to
require
separate
suppliers
to
be
available
for
those
separate
products.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
the
radiologist,
the
pathologist,
all
of
the
laboratory
work
as
well.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
so
far
as
the
question
whether
it
is
a
single
product
for
anti-trust
purposes
is
concerned
we
think
the
surgeon
is
also
part
of
that
package.
again,
i
think
i
have
to
go
back
to
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
that
one
can
put
together
medical
services
in
many
ways
and
many
hospitals
do.
some
hospitals
are
completely
open
staff
right
from
the
beginning,
that
is,
that
there
are
separate
surgeons,
separate
anesthesiologists,
separate
radiologists,
separate
pathologists
and
all
of
them
act
as
independent
contractors.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
anti-trust
laws
that
prohibit
hospitals
from
doing
that.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
anti-trust
laws
that
prohibits
the
hospital
from
selling
them
as
a
service.
in
fact,
these
different
ways
of
assembling
a
medical
product
are
just
the
forms
of
competition
in
this
market.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
east
jefferson
the
radiologist
is
under
full-time
exclusive
contract
to
the
hospital.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no.
he
is
not
an
employee.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
is
like
the
anesthesiologist
although
not
like
the
nurse
although
one
of
the
points
we--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--if
the

mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
if
he
wants
to
go
to
east
jefferson
general
hospital.
he
has,
of
course,
quite
a
large
number
of
other
hospitals
to
go
to,
and
that
is
our
market
power
point,
your
honor,
that
assuming
this
is
best
analyzed
as
a
tying
the
per
se
rule
still
does
not
apply
unless
there
is
market
power.
we
think
there
are
several
problems
in
the
market
power
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
under
fortner
it
is
not
evidence
of
market
power
simply
to
sell
two
products
in
a
package.
as
fortner
said
it
is
possible
to
sell--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
second
argument
that
there
is
no
market
power.
as
fortner
said
it
is
possible
to
have
cheap
credit
and
sell
expensive
houses,
and
that
is
not
a
question
of
market
power.
what
you
would
look
for
the
court
said
in
fortner
is
some
elevation
of
the
package
price.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
record
that
no
one
at
trial
testified
that
this
arrangement
raised
the
package
price
of
operating
rooms
and
anesthesiology.
the
executive
director
of
the
hospital
testified
to
the
contrary
that
this
had
reduced
the
package
price
and
there
was
no
contrary
evidence
of
any
sort.
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
this
had
raised
the
package
price
of
the
anesthesiology-operating
room
package.
so
we
suggest
that
under
the
first
and
most
narrow
interpretation
of
fortner
ii
there
is
no
market
power
in
this
case.
the
second
reason
why
we
have
argued
that
there
is
no
market
power
in
this
case
is
because
the
market
is
properly
characterized
as
one
of
anesthesia
services.
the
hospital
is
acquiring
anesthesia
services
to
put
into
this
package
of
surgery
and
medical
care
by
looking
throughout
the
nation.
the
anesthesiologists
who
have
ended
up
in
new
orleans
came
in
one
case
from
minnesota
and
another
case
from
florida
and
another
case
from
california,
and
it
again
is
undisputed
in
this
record
that
there
is
nationwide
movement
of
anesthesiologists.
that
means
that
both
for
what
the
hospital
is
doing
the
hospital
can
turn
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
to
hire
its
employees
or
acquire
its
exclusive
contracts
and
similarly
the
anesthesiologists
can
turn
to
the
nation
as
a
whole,
that
is,
those
who
believe
the
competitive
opportunities
in
new
orleans
are
not
what
they
might
be,
can
easily
go
to
florida.
as
dr.
adriani,
respondent's
specialist
expert,
testified
in
this
case
anesthesiologists
are
like
nomads,
and
they
are
like
nomads
precisely
because
they
lack
patient
contact,
that
they
are
brought
into
a
case
by
a
surgeon
as
part
of
the
hospital's
package
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
individual
contacts
with
patients.
ultimately
our
argument
in
this
case
is
that
this
contract
is
best
understood
as
a
means
of
organizing
that
nationwide
competition
to
the
benefit
of
patients.
exclusive
contracts
are
a
method
by
which
hospitals
can
set
anesthesiologists
to
bidding
against
one
another
for
the
position.
in
fact--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--not
on
the
competition
for
the
position
at
hospitals,
your
honor.
there
is
absolutely
none,
and
that
is
one
reason
why
we
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
mistaken
in
believing
that
there
is
something
special
about
medicine.
no
impact
whatsoever.
dr.
hyde
was
asked
at
one
point
in
the
trial
why
he
did
not
have
or
did
not
want
an
exclusive
contract,
and
his
answer
was
at
page
76
of
the
transcript
of
the
second
day
and
i
quote
"that
gets
to
practice
by
the
lowest
bidder,
and
i
think
that
is
not
our
intent
in
the
practice
of
medicine.
"
well,
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
the
anti-trust
laws
do
not
require
practice
by
the
lower
bidder,
but
the
argument
that
they
prohibit
practice
by
the
lowest
bidder
is
nothing
short
of
flabbergasting.
thanks
very
much.
