unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
this
arrangement
resembles
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
your
group
practice
example?
supposing
they
include
a
dentist
and
they
had
all
the
dentists
in
washington
in
that
particular
group
arrangement
and
they
said
you
cannot
get
your
teeth
fixed
unless
you
take
all
your
other
services
from
our
group
practice
association.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
washington
in
my
example.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
you
to
answer
my
example
assuming
washington.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
monopoly
of
dentistry
and
then
the...
but
what
if
they--
unknown
speaker
--well,
of
course,
the
issue
would
be
whether
it
did.
they
would
only
perform
dentistry
if
the
patient
agreed
to
have
all
other
medical
work
done
by
the
association.
that
is
the
hypothesis.
you
say
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right?
unknown
speaker
does
our
opinion
in
goldfarb
have
any
implications
here
directly
or
indirectly?
as
you
remember
all
of
the
lawyers
in
northern
virginia
at
least
got
together
and
agreed
on
a
fixed
price
and
would
not
perform
any
services
for
clients
except
at
that
price.
unknown
speaker
they
cooperated
to
the
extent
they
all
agreed
to
the
same
prices.
that
is
a
pretty
good
cooperation
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
did
more
than
that.
they
refused
to
perform
a
service
for
anyone
who
would
meet
the
price
which
is
closely
related,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
what
you
are
discussing
now
i
take
it
are
largely
matters
of
fact.
did
the
district
court
make
findings
in
many
of
these
areas
that
the
court
of
appeals
upset
them
on
a
thoroughly
erroneous
basis?
what
is
the
factual
state
of
this
particular
point
you
are
making?
how
do
patients
see
the
furnishing
of
anesthesiologists?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
district
court
know
that?
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
factual--
unknown
speaker
--or
any
hospital
but
this
one,
especially
a
hospital
that
had
hired
anesthesiologists.
unknown
speaker
does
the
hospital
in
this
case
separately
bill
the
anesthesiologists?
unknown
speaker
what
other
line
items?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
figure
for
anesthesiology
cover?
does
it
cover
the
service
or
how
about
materials
that
are
used?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
anesthesia
itself?
unknown
speaker
that
is
under
drugs?
unknown
speaker
no
one
suggested
that
that
is
a
separate
product
i
do
no
suppose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
does
the
billing
procedure
whereby
they
split
the
anesthesia
bill
as
i
understand
it
apply
to
all
three
of
those
items?
i
mean
is
the
procedure
by
which
the
anesthesiologists
and
the
hospital
share
the
payment
for
those
items
the
same?
unknown
speaker
that
50
percent
would
cover
the
anesthetists,
too,
because
they
are
paid
by
the
hospital.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
is
it
your
view
that
the
product
here
is
a
surgical
service?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
embrace?
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
surgical
service
embrace
within
the
concept
of
the
product
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
are
radiologists
also
included?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
surgeon?
unknown
speaker
how
did
you
say
the
radiologist
is
furnished
here?
unknown
speaker
he
is
not
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
he
is
like
the
anesthesiologist.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
surgeon?
unknown
speaker
and
one
who
needs
his
service
has
to
take
him?
unknown
speaker
is
this
argument
related
to
your
argument
about
no
market
power?
unknown
speaker
your
second
argument?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
impact
of
insurance
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
to
ask
just
one
question?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
are
arguing
now
there
is
no
tie
which
is
mr.
easterbrook's
first
position.
unknown
speaker
he
also
argues
there
is
no
market
power
and
thirdly
there
is
no
enhancement
of
market
power.
do
you
support
all
three
of
those
contentions?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
suggest
how
we
should
make
this
distinction?
unknown
speaker
the
tying
which
is
a
package
deal.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
this
is
essential
before
we
can
have
a
tying?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
not
true
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
not
right
about
that
then
you
have
a
couple
of
much
harder
arguments
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
give
you
a
hypothetical
and
ask
you
how
your
approach
would
treat
it?
supposing
that
in
this
case
the
record
showed...
i
do
not
suppose
it
does...
that
there
is
an
effective
competitive
ceiling
on
what
the
hospital
can
charge
for
its
service,
but
the
anesthesiologists
are
able
to
charge
more
and
that
the
hospital
wants
an
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
so
that
they
can
split
the
fees
of
the
anesthesiologists
and
get
part
of
the
return
that
the
anesthesiologists
get
and,
therefore,
enhance
the
price
of
the
hospital
service.
would
you
say
that
made
it
bad
or
not
if
that
is
what
the
record
showed?
unknown
speaker
the
market.
unknown
speaker
just
a
market
ceiling.
insurance
companies
make
it
practical
to
charge
more,
but
they
in
effect
obeyed
that
ceiling
by
getting
a
part
of
the
return
that
the
anesthesiologists
are
able
to
get.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
does
not
does
the
record
in
this
case
tell
us
whether
or
not
that
is
what
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
really
tell
us,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
does
it
tell
us
why
they
have
this
exclusive
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
because
the
doctors
did
not
want
it.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
doctor
testified
he
did
not
want
the
exclusive
arrangement
but
nevertheless
the
hospital
insisted
on
it.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
the
hospital
that
wants
it
what
are
we
to
infer
is
the
reason
for
the
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter,
is
it
not
very
likely
that
the
attending
physician
of
the
patient
has
referred
him
to
this
place
the
way
a
solicitor
in
england
refers
cases
to
barristers?
is
that
not
very
likely
the
way
it
happens
here?
unknown
speaker
people
just
do
not
find
a
hospital
the
way
they
find
a
supermarket.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
true
that
the
patient
has
to
take
the
surgeon
the
hospital
provides?
unknown
speaker
the
patient
has
to
take
the
surgeon
the
hospital
provides.
unknown
speaker
even
though
that
be
true,
as
i
understand
it
the
surgeon
has
to
take
this
package
that
the
hospital
provides
including
anesthesiologists.
unknown
speaker
i
know
he
does
not,
but
he
has
to
use
those
facilities,
does
he
not,
under
this
arrangement
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
or
by
the
surgeon
you
mean.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it
even
though
the
surgeon
may
not
come
with
the
package
everyone
else
does
including
the
anesthesiologist.
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
but
they
do
come
with
the
package.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
if
you
are
going
to
be
in
that
hospital
and
you
need
a
radiologist
you
are
going
to
use
the
radiologist.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
does
your
argument
depend
on
your
assumption
that
people
go
to
the
hospital
that
is
nearest
to
where
they
live?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
the
doctor
goes
to
the
hospital
that
is
nearest
his
office
and
the
patient
goes
to
the
hospital
that
is
nearest
his
home.
your
case
does
not
depend
on
that
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
look
to
somebody
other
than
me
please.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
the
mayo
clinic
is
not
a
partnership.
unknown
speaker
and
it
does
not
own
any
hospitals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
landis,
how
large
a
hospital
is
it?
how
many
beds?
unknown
speaker
assuming
you
wanted
to
go
to
that
particular
hospital
you
just
cannot
be
treated
by
an
doctor
you
want.
say
you
have
an
internal
medicine
problem.
if
you
want
to
go
to
that
hospital
you
are
going
to
have
to
use
some
doctor
that
is
on
a
staff,
are
you
not,
who
is
admitted
to
practice
in
the
hospital?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
do
not
really
support
all
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
in
defining
their
market
they
thought
that
a
lot
of
patients
prefer
hospitals
closer
to
their
home
so
they
want
to
go
to
that
hospital.
unknown
speaker
or
it
could
be
larger.
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
larger.
if
you
were
going
to
go
where
your
doctor
took
you,
you
do
not
really
care.
unknown
speaker
mr.
landis,
this
and
many
of
the
other
points
you
have
just
been
covering
are
all
factual
questions
are
they
not?
we
may
all
have
some
recollection
of
what
happened
to
us
when
we
were
in
the
hospital,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
things
are
done
the
same
way
in
washington
as
they
are
in
new
orleans
or
somewhere
else
so
when
you
talk
now
about
why
a
patient
goes
to
a
hospital
are
you
referring
to
something
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
with
one
question
about
the
facts
now
because
when
i
asked
the
solicitor
general
why
there
was
this
arrangement
he
referred
me
to
finding
19
on
pages
32a
and
33a.
is
that
the
finding
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
as
clearly
erroneous,
the
one
about
the
reasons
for
the
agreement?
unknown
speaker
your
view
is
what
you
call
a
tie
was
an
originally
lawful
agreement,
but
it
became
unlawful
when
the
anesthesiologist
was
no
longer
interested
in
preserving
his
exclusive
position.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
record
shows
was
the
reason
why
the
hospital
preserved
the
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
say
they
did
nothing.
they
paid
the
nurse
anesthetist
and
they
provided
the
facilities
and
the
place
to--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
the
hospital
has
market
power
why
does
it
have
to
go
through
all
of
this
shenanigans?
why
does
it
not
just
raise
the
cost
of
the
hospital
services?
unknown
speaker
mr.
landis,
is
it
your
position
that
the
patient
should
have
a
right
as
a
matter
of
anti-trust
law
to
choose
a
specialist
that
a
hospital
normally
provides?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
no
benefit
that
flows
from
the
hospital
having
the
sort
of
arrangement
that
this
hospital
has?
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
any
more
chaotic
situation
than
where
every
patient
had
the
right
to
choose
every
specialist
who
performed
in
a
hospital?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
am
asking
you
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
it
does
not
become
chaotic
do
we
need
any
evidence,
concrete
evidence,
to
show
that
a
coordinated,
integrated
system
of
all
these
different
specialties
is
more
efficient
than
having
the
freelancers
come
in
at
every
stage
whether
it
is
a
therapist
who
is
going
to
assist
an
orthopedic
patient
after
a
hip
operation
or
whatever?
do
you
mean
to
tell
me--
unknown
speaker
--does
your
case
depend
on
there
being
no
greater
efficiency
in
this
type
of
operation
over
the
kind
that
you
are
advocating?
unknown
speaker
would
your
theory
apply
to
a
law
firm
that
has
a
tax
division
that
takes
care
of
the
clients'
tax
problems
and
a
probate
division
that
takes
care
of
drafting
wills
and
trusts
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
but
the
principle
of
having
all
of
the
specialty
trained
people
coordinated
in
one
operation
is
that
not
something
that
could
be
taken
into
account
in
applying
the
rule
of
reason
as
the
district
court
did?
unknown
speaker
mr.
landis,
is
it
your
view
that
a
closed
staff,
privately
owned
and
operated
hospital
would
be
a
per
se
violation
of
anti-trust
laws?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
example,
some
hospitals
today
are
owned
by
public
corporations.
in
my
city
of
richmond,
virginia
a
number
of
hospitals
were
owned
by
the
doctors.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
private
hospitals
in
the
new
orleans
area?
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
closed
staffs?
unknown
speaker
in
new
orleans
they
have
several
hospitals
that
are
for
profit.
unknown
speaker
they
sure
do.
mr.
landis,
why
should
the
court
ever
apply
a
per
se
rule
in
these
cases
instead
of
a
rule
of
reason
in
each
instance?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
public
and
the
purposes
of
the
anti-trust
law
basically
served
by
just
recognizing
that
we
ought
to
apply
a
rule
of
reason?
unknown
speaker
let
me
stop
you
right
there.
why
is
that
a
different
case?
supposing
they
had
four
professional
doctor
anesthesiologists
on
their
salary
and
therefore
if
a
patient
went
to
the
hospital
he
had
to
take
one
of
those
four.
why
would
that
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
there
would
be
a
different
competitive
significance
if
that
is
true
or
it
is
just
a
kind
of
loop
hole
in
the
law?
unknown
speaker
they
could
delegate
salary
doctors
the
authority
to
send
out
the
bills
i
suppose.
i
do
not
understand
why
that
would
be
different.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
blame
you
for
thinking
that
unless
you
want
to
take
a
position
that
the
hired
staff
would
also
violate
the
anti-trust
law.
you
do
not
want
to
press
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
could
have
sued
or
did
you
sue
the
anesthesiologists
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
were
nevertheless
a
party
to
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
a
tying
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
asked
for
an
injunction
only
and
then
the
contract
is
expired.
does
that
not
raise
some
sort
of
a
mootness
question?
unknown
speaker
it
might
repeat.
unknown
speaker
they
have
some
other
exclusive
arrangements,
do
they
not,
for
other
specialties?
unknown
speaker
for
what?
unknown
speaker
so
they
have
exactly
the
same
arrangement
with
other
specialists?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
the
kind
that
you
would
attack.
unknown
speaker
yes.
if
you
knew
what
they
were.
even
the
pathologists?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
the
patient
selects
his
own
pathologist.
[laughter]
