mr.
john
m.
landis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
petitioners
point
out
in
their
reply
brief
our
perspective
in
this
case
is
quite
different
than
theirs.
whereas
the
petitioners
suggestion
in
this
case
will
decide
the
legality
of
all
exclusive
contracts
at
all
hospitals
we
do
not.
we
believe
that
this
case
concerns
one
particular
contract
at
one
particular
hospital,
and
that
contract
has
got
to
be
judged
under
the
particular
market
and
competitive
conditions
that
are
reflected
in
the
record
of
this
case.
whereas
the
petitioners
ask
the
court
to
decide
this
case
by
making
certain
assumptions
regarding
those
competitive
conditions
and
regarding
those
market
conditions,
we
do
not.
we
submit
that
this
case...
we
submit
that
when
the
petitioners'
assumptions
are
compared
with
the
record
of
this
case
they
just
do
not
stand
up.
i
would
like
to
discuss
two
crucial
assumptions
that
the
petitioners'
arguments
are
based
on.
perhaps
the
most
important
assumption
is
that
the
petitioners
asked
the
court
to
assume
that
there
is
no
competition
among
anesthesiologists
to
begin
with,
and
this
is
obviously
an
important
assumption
because
if
it
is
correct
the
petitioner
should
win
the
case.
after
all,
if
there
is
no
competition
to
begin
with
then
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
a
tying
arrangement
restrains
competition.
however,
we
submit
the
argument
that
that
assumption
is
not
correct.
the
record
indicates
that
anesthesiologists
can
and
do
compete
against
each
other
for
patients'
business
when
they
are
able
to,
when
they
are
permitted
to.
the
basis
of
the
petitioners'
argument
or
their
assumption
that
there
is
no
competition
is
their
view
of
the
market
structure
in
the
health
care
industry.
they
contend
that
patients
purchase
medical
care
regardless
of
the
kind,
regardless
of
the
nature
from
hospitals
rather
than
from
doctors.
according
to
the
petitioners
patients
simply
present
themselves
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
and
ask
for
medical
treatment,
and
they
really
have
no
greater
interest
in
who
performs
surgery
on
them
or
who
more
directly
in
this
case
who
puts
them
to
sleep
for
that
surgery
than
they
would
as
to
who
supplies
the
thermometer
that
is
given
to
them
in
the
hospital.
mr.
john
m.
landis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
landis
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
anesthesiologist
would
be
selected
by
the
surgeon,
not
by
the
patient.
now
there
are
a
few
cases
in
which
the
patient
may
select
the
anesthesiologist,
but
the
important
point
is
the
patient
delegates
that
decision
to
the
surgeon,
and
under
the
kind
of
contract
that
we
have
at
issue
here
the
surgeon
has
no
more
choice,
no
more
freedom
of
choice,
no
more
discretion
than
would
be
the
patient.
mr.
john
m.
landis
the--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--initially...
that
is
another
point
which
we
disagree
with
the
petitioners.
patients
do
not
come
to
hospitals
for
surgery.
they
go
see
their
surgeon
initially
i
am
sure
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
outside
the
hospital.
in
fact,
that
is
what
the
record
reflects
in
this
case.
if
the
decision
is
made
that
the
patient
requires
surgery
the
surgeon
will
admit
the
patient
to
a
hospital,
and
that
hospital
as
the
record
reflects
is
likely
to
be
the
one
closest
to
the
surgeon's
office,
likely
to
be
the
one
closest
to
the
patient's
home.
but
it
is
one
at
which
the
surgeon
has
clinical
privileges.
in
fact--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--the
surgeon
does
not
purchase
the
hospital
services.
mr.
john
m.
landis
the
only
decision
the
surgeon
makes
as
to
what
he
uses
is
the
operating
room.
mr.
john
m.
landis
certainly
the
surgeon
who
had
been
using
east
jefferson
general
hospital
under
this
contract
probably
knew
that
he
would
not
have
a
choice
of
anesthesiologists,
but
the
point
is
the
decision
to
choose
an
anesthesiologist
does
not
arise
until
the
patient
is
already
in
the
hospital
and
whether
it
be
made
by
the
patient
or
by
the
anesthesiologist
once
the
patient
is
in
the
hospital
for
surgery--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--yes,
excuse
me,
by
the
surgeon.
but
once
the
patient
is
in
the
hospital
neither
the
surgeon
nor
the
patient
is
going
to
change
hospitals
because
they
cannot
have
the
anesthesiologist
of
their
choice.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
not
everyone.
as
mr.
easterbrook
pointed
out
i
think
the
cardiologists
are
under
contract
with
the
hospital
at
the
present
time,
the
radiologists
and
perhaps
the
pathologists.
mr.
john
m.
landis
if
you
accept
that
this
is
package.
mr.
john
m.
landis
and
you
will
be
billed
a
separate
charge
for
that
service.
mr.
john
m.
landis
now
anesthesiology
is
no
longer
a
speciality
that
is
under
contract
at
the
hospital.
the
anesthesiologists
who
practice
there
including
dr.
hyde
bill
their
own
patients.
they
bill
the
patients
separately.
the
hospital
bills
the
patients
for
the
drugs
that
he
used,
but
the
professional
service
is
billed
separately
from
the
hospital,
billed
directly
by
the
physician.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--no,
sir.
it
does
not.
that
was--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--that
was
an
observation
that
both
courts
made
in
connection
with
making
the
findings
regarding
the
market.
no,
our
case
does
not
depend
upon
that
finding.
the
point
is
that
the
competitive
conditions
are
not
like
the
petitioners
would
have
this
court
assume.
east
jefferson
is
not
a
clinic
such
as
the
mayo
clinic
or
the
cleveland
clinic
where
physicians
join
together
as
partners
to
render
comprehensive
medical
care.
mr.
john
m.
landis
excuse
me.
i
used
that
in
the
generic
term.
i
meant
to
us
it--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--my
point
is
that
it
is
not
a
clinic
where
comprehensive
care
is
rendered
to
a
patient,
and
the
patient
as
mr.
easterbrook
said
when
he
goes
in
he
accepts
the
services
of
a
surgeon,
anesthesiologist
and
so
forth.
now
a
law
firm
would
be
more
analogous
to
that
situation
than
it
is
to
east
jefferson
general
hospital.
east
jefferson
general
hospital
is
an
acute
care
hospital,
and
it
is
neither
owned
nor
controlled
nor
associated
other
than
perhaps
by
contracts
with
the
physicians
who
use
its
facilities.
mr.
john
m.
landis
it
is
i
believe
between
500
an
600
beds
now.
it
has
been
expanding
so
rapidly
that
i
am
not
sure
exactly
where
it
is
now.
it
is
approximately
500
i
would
think.
mr.
john
m.
landis
my
point
is
that
patients
do
not
go
to
hospitals.
they
go
initially
to
a
physician.
they
go
to
an
internist,
a
surgeon,
whatever
specialist
they
require.
that
physician
would
make
the
decision
as
to
what
hospital
to
put
the
patient
in.
now
perhaps
if
a
physician
was
on
the
staff
of
more
than
one
hospital
he
might
ask
the
patient--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
am
not
sure
to
what
you
are
referring.
mr.
john
m.
landis
to
that
extent
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
market
is
probably
actually
smaller
than
even
the
court
of
appeals
believed.
now
i
am
talking--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--it
could
be
larger.
i
am
talking--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--the
point
is
the
market
for
anesthesiology
services
is
essentially
limited
to
the
hospital.
mr.
john
m.
landis
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
testimony
at
trial
by
a
number
of
physicians
who
testified
about
how
patients
and
surgeons
may
choose
anesthesiologists,
and
my
opening
point
was
that
the
court
should
rely
on
that
record,
on
that
evidence
in
deciding
this
case
and
not
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
no
competition
in
the
industry.
mr.
john
m.
landis
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
said
that
the
exclusive
contract
was
motivated
by
the
purposes
of
the
hospital
to
render
better
medical
care,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
was
clearly
erroneous.
however,
the
record
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief
indicates
that
the
reason
the
hospital
entered
into
this
contract
back
in
1971
was
that
it
had
to
attract
an
anesthesiologist
to
work
there.
it
was
an
unproved
venture.
it
had
no
track
record,
and
it
had
to
attract
someone
just
as
in
the
general
electric
case
when
they
started
selling
and
marketing
regional
antenna
systems
or
local
antenna
systems.
they
had
to
keep
the
whole
package
together
because
it
was
an
unproven
venture.
just
as
in
that
case
circumstances
changed
and
the
justification
for
the
tie
disappeared.
the
same
circumstances
occurred
here.
mr.
john
m.
landis
i
think
there
was
a
valid
business
justification
for
the
tie
in
the
beginning,
and
that
was
that
it
was
needed
to
attract
an
anesthesiologist
to
the
hospital.
that
has
not
been
the
case
for
a
number
of
years,
and
i
do
not
think
even
the
petitioner
would--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
think
the
economics
of
it
explain
that.
the
hospital
in
exchange
for
essentially
doing
nothing
was
given
50
percent
of
the
revenues
produced
by
the
anesthesia
department.
as
we--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--the
facilities
were
built
separately.
you
are
right.
they
did
do
something.
they
paid
the
nurse
anesthetist,
but
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
tying
arrangement
is
to
disguise
price.
the
contract
artificially
limited
the
number
of
anesthesiologists
that
were
out
there
by
allowing
the
hospital
to
skim
off
profits
that
otherwise
could
have
been
used
to
attract
additional
anesthesiologists.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
noted
in
footnote
10
of
its
opinion
that
at
the
time
of
trial
in
1980
there
were
over
10,000
operations
performed
per
year
at
the
hospital.
using
a
very
conservative
figure
in
that
footnote
of
$100
per
operation
the
court
calculated
that
the
revenues
produced
were
approximately
$1
million
a
year,
and
probably
$200
an
operation
would
be
more
realistic
because
in
1978
when
there
were
only
seven
operating
rooms
in
use
the
department
of
anesthesia
generated
$1.6
million.
that
is
shown
at
page
51
of
the
appendix.
the
hospital
took
50
percent
of
those
revenues,
and
it
paid
the
nurse
anesthetists
and
had
something
left
over
which
it
put
back
into
its
operating
fund.
the
hospital
is
a
nonprofit
operation,
but--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
think
the
hospital's
opening
its
staff
when
the
medicare
rules
changed
indicates
why
they
had
to
do
that.
while
this
case
was
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit
the
medicare
rules
did
change.
the
rules
no
longer
permit
hospitals
to
receive
reimbursement
for
anesthesia
in
excess
of
the
compensation
paid
to
the
anesthesiologist.
now
if
the
purpose
were
really
to
create
efficiency,
make
the
operation
more
efficient
that
should
not
be
any
reason
for
the
hospital
to
change
its
system.
however,
the
hospital
immediately
"opened
its
staff"
and
terminated
the
contract
and
ended
the
very
contract
we
are
attacking.
if
their
motive
was
one
of
efficiency
the
new
rules
would
not
have
effected
that.
however,
if
their
motive
was
one
of
receiving
excess
profits
that
they
could
not
get
in
other
ways
that
they
could
not
get
reimbursement
for
for
other
services
but
could
get
it
here
that
rule
would
directly
affect
that
motive.
we
submit
that
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
from
what
we
have
said
so
far
it
should
be
obvious
that
we
believe
the
legality
of
the
exclusive
contract
must
be
judged
from
the
perspective
of
its
impact
on
patients
and
on
anesthesiologists,
and
in
their
reply
brief
at
pages
2
and
11
the
petitioners
point
out
their
disagreement
with
that
position.
they
say
it
is
wrong
to
consider
the
perspective
of
the
patient,
is
wrong
to
consider
the
perspective
of
the
anesthesiologist.
this
must
be
considered
only
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
hospital.
now
again
if
they
are
right
then
they
should
win
the
case
because
we
have
never
alleged
much
less
tried
to
prove
that
this
contract
restrained
competition
among
hospitals.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
alleged
and
we
have
proved
that
the
contract
injured
patients
by
depriving
them
of
an
opportunity
to
choose
an
anesthesiologist
either
through
themselves
or
through
their
surgeons.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
your
honor,
but
it
is
my
position
that
before
that
right
is
taken
away
there
has
got
to
be
a
good
reason,
and
i
submit
there
is
no
good
reason
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
landis
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
suggesting.
i
think
the
record
supports
that.
mr.
john
m.
landis
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
that
this
case
did
not
raise
that
issue.
it
did
not
raise
the
issue--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
think
certainly
there
are
limits
and
that
would
be
a
justification
if
the
situation
became
so
chaotic
that
the
quality
of
care
suffered.
i
believe
that
would
be
a
valid
justification
for
limiting
their
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
john
m.
landis
i
think
that
is--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
think
that
is
the
role
of
competition.
mr.
easterbrook
said
that
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
we
could
have
a
completely
open
staff
and
if
there
would
more
anesthesiologists
in
business
then
they
would
all
be
part
time.
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct.
competition
teaches
us
that
the
good
anesthesiologists,
the
most
skilled,
would
work
full
time
and
the
least
skilled
would
not
work
at
all.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
your
honor,
i
think
the
clinic
that
i
describe
is
more
closely
analogous
to
a
law
firm.
a
hospital
is
not
analogous
to
a
law
firm.
a
hospital
is
not
a
direct
competitor
with
doctors
but
it
renders
services
on
the
same
level.
it
has
a
horizontal
complementary
relationship
wit
doctors.
mr.
john
m.
landis
your
honor,
all
these
justifications
as
far
as
efficiency
were
investigated
at
trial,
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
found
on
the
record
that
either
of
these
justifications
did
not
exist.
these
efficiencies
did
not
exist
based
upon
the
record
or
if
they
did
exist
they
could
be
achieved
without
granting
monopoly
to
one
group
of
anesthesiologists.
that
is
the
least
restrictive
alternative
analysis
which
this
court
used
last
year
in
the
maricopa
county
case.
it
found
that
although
it
may
be
beneficial
for
there
to
be
a
price
schedule
for
reimbursement
for
medical
fees
there
was
a
less
restrictive
way
to
do
it.
doctors
did
not
have
to
do
the
price
fixing,
and
that
is
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
was
employed
here.
mr.
john
m.
landis
owned
by
whom,
your
honor?
mr.
john
m.
landis
i
think
if
the
hospitals
were
owned
by
the
doctors
that
might
present
a
different
question,
but
assume
a
hospital
owned
by
a
corporation
independent
of
the
doctors
i
think
under
the
right
market
conditions
and
right
competitive
conditions
it
might
be
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
laws.
i
think
each
case
has
got
to
be
judged
on
the
market
as
the
per
se
rule
requires.
it
requires
an
analysis
of
the
market
and
of
the
competitive
impact
at
least
the
per
se
rule
for--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--yes,
sir.
there
are
quite
a
few.
mr.
john
m.
landis
some
of
them
do
and
some
of
them
do
not.
the
majority
of
the
hospitals
in
the
new
orleans
area
at
least
until
the
new
medicare
rules
had
closed
staffs,
and
that
was
one
of
the
problems
is
that
because
of
that
you
have
an
allocation
in
the
market
to
the
contract
groups
rather
than...
a
new
entrant
into
the
market
essentially
would
have
to
go
to
work
for
one
of
those
groups
if
he
wanted
to
be
able
to
practice.
that
is
one
of
the
evils
produced
by
these
kinds
of
contracts.
mr.
john
m.
landis
yes,
sir.
there
are.
mr.
john
m.
landis
i
think
with
respect
to
tying
cases
the
per
se
rule
as
the
government
points
out
and
as
the
petitioners
point
out
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
per
se
rule.
it
does
allow
some
flexibility.
it
does
allow
some
analysis,
and
i
think
the
way
the
rule
has
evolved--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--because
i
think
there
is
enough
flexibility
now
in
the
current
rule
to
properly
weed
out
the
cases
that
are
not
violations
from
the
ones
that
are.
if
the
court
believes
that
perhaps
the
rule
should
be
evaluated
i
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
case
to
do
it.
this
is
not
a
typical
industry.
this
is
not
an
industry
characterized
by
active
price
competition.
this
is
not
the
case
to
rewrite
the
rule
on
time
arrangements.
i
was
discussing
the
perspective
of
the
patients
and
physicians.
in
united
states
v.
loew's,
inc.
the
court
had
this
to
say
about
tying
arrangements.
they
are
an
object
of
anti-trust
concern
for
two
reasons.
they
may
force
buyers
into
giving
up
the
purchase
of
substitutes
for
the
tied
product,
and
they
may
destroy
the
free
access
of
competing
suppliers
of
the
tied
product
to
the
consumer
market.
that
is
exactly
our
perspective.
we
are
looking
at
the
consumer,
that
is,
the
patient
and
the
competing
suppliers
of
the
tied
product,
that
is
the
anesthesiologists.
when
the
record
is
considered
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
perspective
is
not
the
one
chosen
by
the
hospital,
by
the
petitioners
because
the
record
supports
that
the
contract
coerced
patients,
denied
them
freedom
of
choice
and
essentially
eliminated
any
chance
for
competition
among
anesthesiologists.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
respond
to
the
arguments
of
the
petitioners
and
the
government
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
exclusive
contract
should
be
considered
for
anti-trust
purposes.
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
contract
is
merely
a
vehicle
by
which
the
hospital
attempted
to
vertically
integrate
its
operation
and
that
it
is
really
no
different
than
an
employment
contract.
we
disagree
with
that
position,
and
if
the
label
makes
any
difference...
i
am
not
sure
it
does...
we
submit
that
this
is
a
horizontal,
not
a
vertical
restraint.
as
i
have
discussed
a
few
minutes
ago
hospitals
all
operate
on
the
same
level
as
doctors.
they
both
sell
things
to
patients.
they
may
not
be
competitors
in
the
sense
they
do
not
sell
the
same
products,
but
they
sell
on
the
same
level.
through
the
contract
the
hospital
combined
with
a
competitor
in
the
market
for
anesthesia
to
exclude
another
competitor.
i
submit
that
certainly
is
a
horizontal
restraint.
the
petitioners'
argument
that
they
could
have
employed
anesthesiologists
without
violating
the
anti-trust
laws
is
misplaced.
the
fact
is
they
did
not
do
that.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court
and
the
fact
that
that
may
or
may
not
have
violated
the
laws
should
not
affect
this
case.
the
government
argues
that
the
exclusive
contract
is--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--your
honor,
the
fact
that
an
anti-trust
defendant
can
perhaps
achieve
the
same--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
think
not
only
the
fact
of
whether
it
is
employment
or
contract
would
be
different
but
other
facts
would
be
different
if
this
were
truly
an
employment
situation.
we
would
not
have
the
economics
at
play
that
we
have
here.
we
would
not
have
the...
presumably
the
physicians
would
be--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--your
honor,
as
i
say
perhaps
it
could
have
employed
the
anesthesiologists
without
violating
the
law.
they
did
not
do
it.
that
case
is
not
before
the
court,
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
frankly
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
your
honor.
i
will
not
take
position
on
that
because
that
is
not
this
case
and
frankly
i
do
not
know.
i
think
it
could
under
some
circumstances,
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
m.
landis
no,
we
did
not
sue
them,
your
honor,
primarily
because
they
were
against
this
contract,
too.
mr.
john
m.
landis
they
were
parties
to
the
contract--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--we
could
have
sued
them,
but
we
did
not
just
as
we
did
not
ask
for
damages.
we
asked
for
an
injunction.
we
were
not
interested
in
the
monetary
losses.
we
were
interested
in
obtaining
staff
privileges
for
dr.
hyde.
the
government
argues
that
this--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--your
honor,
the
petitioners
raised
that
issue
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
they
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
mootness.
we
opposed
the
motion
on
the
ground
of
the
w.
t.
grant
case
that
when
the--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--the
fifth
circuit
apparently
agreed.
i
think
that
that
case
is
still
applicable
now.
mr.
john
m.
landis
the
hospital
currently
does,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
landis
for
cardiologists,
radiologists
and--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--i
am
not
sure
they
are
exactly
the
same--
mr.
john
m.
landis
--they
are
the
kind
that
i
would
attack.
mr.
john
m.
landis
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
the
economics
may
be
different.
mr.
john
m.
landis
i
think
that
may
reach
the
limit
of
when
these
contracts
can
be
attacked,
but
fortunately
we
do
not
have
that
case
before
us
either.
in
summary,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
three
points.
first,
the
court
should
look
to
the
actual
market
conditions
and
not
to
theoretical
models
of
noncompetition
in
deciding
the
legality
of
the
case.
that
requires
looking
at
the
case
from
the
perspective
of
the
patients
and
anesthesiologists,
not
from
the
perspective
of
the
hospital.
second,
that
the
exclusive
contract
injured
competition
is
undeniable,
and
i
do
not
think
petitioners
deny
it.
the
only
question
relates
to
the
significance
of
that.
they
claim
that
there
is
a
national
market
and
that
any
local
restraint
necessarily
is
insignificant.
we
claim
that
national
market
argument
is
unfounded.
third,
the
per
se
rule
against
tying
arrangements
was
expressly
designed
to
prevent
the
evils
occurred
here,
that
is,
a
coercion
of
consumers
to
buy
goods
from
one
competitor
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
and
second
the
exclusion
of
competitors,
the
exclusion
of
potential
suppliers
of
the
tied
point.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
we
will
rest
on
our
brief.
