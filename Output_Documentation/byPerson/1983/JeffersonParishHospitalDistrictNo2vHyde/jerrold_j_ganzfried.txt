mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
contends
that
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
found
that
the
hospital's
exclusive
dealing
contract
was
an
illegal
tying.
this
decision
should
be
reversed
not
only
because
of
its
adverse
impact
of
the
health
care
industry
but
also
because
it
distorts
important
principles
of
anti-trust
law
that
are
of
more
general
application
to
other
segments
of
the
economy.
in
our
view
the
primary
flaw
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
its
fixation
on
labels
rather
than
substance.
we
start
from
the
premise
stated
in
times-picayune
and
reiterated
in
sylvania
that
competitive
realities
and
substance
must
dominate
anti-trust
analysis.
with
this
guiding
principle
in
mind
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
tying
cases
decided
by
this
court
deciding
with
the
motion
pictures
patent
case
which
was
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
which
is
reported
in
volume
243
of
the
u.s.
reports.
what
emerges
from
this
case,
the
motion
picture
patents
through
fortner
ii
in
1977
is
this:
that
concern
with
tying
arrangements
flows
from
the
potential
transfer
of
economic
power
from
one
market
into
a
second
market.
ultimately
the
concern
is
that
two
independent
monopolies
will
be
created.
now
it
is
common
ground
that
we
do
not
have
to
wait
until
that
result
occurs
before
action
can
be
taken
so
the
task
is
to
predict
when
there
is
a
possibility
or
a
substantial
threat
that
such
economic
harm
will
result.
now
as
it
happens
the
concept
of
a
tying
is
not
easily
defined
because
any
sale
of
a
multi-component
product
or
service
is
susceptible
of
being
called
a
tying
even
where
the
bundling
of
components
in
a
single
package
is
pro-competitive,
produces
efficiencies
or
is
done
for
a
legitimate
business
reason.
this
has
led
to
a
good
deal
of
confusion
because
if
the
line
is
drawn
too
mechanically
as
we
believe
it
was
in
this
case
then
these
pro-competitive
benefits
will
be
lost
even
when
there
is
little
or
no
danger
of
competitive
harm.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
surely.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
the
first
point.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
do
although
on
one
of
his
arguments
on
market
power
we
take
no
position,
that
is,
that
the
appropriate
market
is
the
national
market
for
purchasing
services
of
anesthesiologists.
now
in
following
this
through
the
court
has
recognized
that
not
all
package
sales
are
illegal.
for
example,
times-picayune--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--as
to
which
are
and
which
are
not--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i
believe
i
will
and
that
is
this:
that
ultimately
the
concern
with
tyings
is
that
you
have
power
in
one
separate
market
that
you
can
transfer
to
a
second
market.
in
order
to
do
this
first
you
have
to--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that
is
right.
that
is
right.
first,
you
have
to
define
the
relevant
market
for
the
tying
product
and
then
determine
whether
there
is
substantial
market
power
in
that
market
because
if
there
is
none
then
you
have
no
power
to
transfer
elsewhere.
you
have
no
leverage
that
you
can
exert
into
a
second
market.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
is
not
true
here
for
several
reasons,
first,
because
we
do
not
believe
there
is
a
second
market.
there
is
one
market.
there
is
one
product.
there
is
a
package
that
has
been
put
together
by
the
hospital
that
should
be
viewed
as
the
exclusive
dealing
arrangement
that
it
is.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
have
other
arguments.
i
do
not
know
that
they
are
necessarily
much
harder.
the
next
is
that
even
if
there
are
two
products
here
and
two
markets,
the
hospital
does
not
have
market
power
in
the
market
for
the
tying
product
which
is
surgical
facilities.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
as
to
the
absence
of
market
power
in
that
market
appear
to
be
supported
by
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
the
district
court's
conclusions
as
to
market
power
to
be
clearly
erroneous
and
so
we
support
them.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
recognize
that
under
the
traditional
analysis
set
down
by
this
court
this
case
is
fairly
easily
decided,
and
that
is
that
the
hospital
lacks
sufficient
market
power
in
the
market
for
the
tying
product.
but
because
it
viewed
certain
so-called
market
imperfections
that
mr.
easterbrook
has
referred
to
it
decided
to
ignore
what
it
recognized
was
the
traditional
analysis
and
the
analysis
that
was
required
in
the
case.
i
think
the
point
i
would
like
to
get
to
is
that
the
ease
with
which
the
court
of
appeals
could
under
the
guise
of
following
accepted
tying
doctrine
as
it
has
been
set
down
by
this
court
and
how
it
could
reach
the
result
that
it
did
which
in
our
view
savages
an
important
notion
of
anti-trust
law
indicates
that
perhaps
some
tightening
up
of
the
definition
is
in
order.
what
we
propose
and
is
described
in
more
detail
in
our
brief
is
this:
that
the
only
time
that
there
is
a
real
concern,
a
real
threat
that
market
power
in
the
first
market
is
going
to
be
transferred
and
used
in
a
second
market
is
where
there
is
ability
to
acquire
substantial
market
power
in
that
second
market.
i
would
like
to
give
an
illustration.
suppose
that
a
company
has
a
dominant
position
in
the
market
for
rubber
stamps
for
making
documents,
and
it
requires
that
all
people
who
buy
its
rubber
stamps
also
buy
ink.
now
we
are
assuming
that
there
is
power
in
the
rubber
stamp
market
in
this,
but
in
this
instance
there
is
no
chance
that
that
power
could
be
transferred
to
the
ink
market.
the
reason
is
that
the
portion
of
the
ink
market
that
is
used
in
conjunction
with
the
rubber
stamp
market
is
miniscule.
it
is
so
small
in
fact
that
a
company
could
not
use
this
tying
to
obtain
power
in
the
ink
market.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
if
i
can
just
get
one
thing
clarified
and
that
is
whether
the
ceiling
on
the
price
that
the
hospital
can
charge--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--market
ceiling.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
would
that
be
bad,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
possibly
yes
but
it
is
something
that
should
be
analyzed
under
the
rule
of
reason.
in
a
particular
circumstance
it
might
be,
but
it
does
not
warrant
per
se
prohibition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
i
understand
the
record
it
does
not.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
in
fact
what
the
record
does
tell
us--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--yes.
the
reason
is--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--we
believe
the
reason
is
that
when
the
hospital
was
opened
in
1971
there
was
some
concern
that
when--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
said
that
in
1976
he
did
not
want
it
to
be
exclusive.
his
group
had
been
the
target
of
some
claims
of
unethical
practice
for
having
entered
into
this
exclusive
contract.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
do
not
think
that
you
need
to
infer.
i
think
you
can
just
look
directly
to
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
district
court
as
to
what
the
advantages
of
the
arrangement
were,
and
they
are
recited
at
pages
32
and
33
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
now
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
conclude
with,
and
i
think
it
is
the
area
in
which
our
submission
may
be
construed
as
moving
a
bit
beyond
the
cases,
and
that
is
the
notion
of
requirement
of
substantial
market
power
in
the
tied
market.
i
would
like
to
point
out
why
in
fact
it
is
not
such
an
extension.
that
is
because
the
focus
on
whether
a
tying
may
promote
substantial
independent
power
in
the
tied
market
conforms
to
economic
reality
and
has
been
noted
in
this
court's
decisions.
going
back
to
the
motion
picture
patents
case
the
concern
was
with
the
effect
on
competition
in
this
tied
market
has
been
made
quite
clear.
in
that
case
the
court
observed
that
the
evil
in
tying
the
use
of
the
patented
projector
to
the
films
was
that
it
allowed
the
company
to
fix
the
price
of
films
as
effectively
as
it
could
fix
the
price
on
the
tying
patented
projector.
that
concern
has
been
followed
through
in
more
recent
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
the
brief.
thank
you.
