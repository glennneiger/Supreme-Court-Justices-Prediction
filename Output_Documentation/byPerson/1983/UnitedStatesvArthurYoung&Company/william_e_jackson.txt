mr.
william
eldred
jackson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
deal
further
with
the
issue
which
has
already
been
raised,
that
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
opinion
and
decision
of
the
second
circuit
below,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
fundamental
fairness.
and
the
issue
is,
quite
simply
as
i
see
it,
whether
it
is
fair
in
the
administration
of
the
adversarial
process
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
service
to
permit
the
service
access
to
the
private
thoughts
of
the
taxpayer
as
to
how
he
intends
to
deal
with
the
irs
in
audit
and
in
litigation.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
think
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
that
court
reached
its
decision.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
think,
your
honor,
this
court
has
held
in
a
series
of
cases,
the
powell
case
being
one,
that
an
irs
summons
will
be
enforced
only
under
certain
conditions.
and
one
condition
is
that
the
service
is
not
already
in
possession
of
the
information.
that
was
part
of
the
ruling
in
powell.
here
there
is
no
question
that
the
service
is
in
possession
of
practically
every
piece
of
paper
in
amerada's
books
and
records
relating
to
the
factual
transactional
aspects
of
its
tax
liabilities.
that
is,
therefore
there
is
no
need
for
the
service
to
seek
the
tax
accrual
papers
when
it
has
had
access
to
all
the
great
volume
of
materials
which
mr.
liggio
mentioned
earlier
from
the
taxpayer.
and
in
euge,
which
is
a
later
case,
the
court
reinforced
that
aspect
of
enforcement
of
an
irs
summons
by
saying
that
enforcement
must
in
the
case
be
necessary
to
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
laws.
now,
we
say
that
access
by
the
service
to
the
judgmental
and
private
thought
papers
contained
in
these
tax
accrual
work
papers
is
not
necessary,
first
because
there
is
no
claim
of
fraud
in
this
case.
and
by
the
way,
your
honors,
when
the
summons
to
arthur
young
was
issued
which
is
here
involved
this
investigation
had
been
under
way
for
a
long
time.
the
service
had
had
the
records
of
amerada
hess
and
it
should
have
known
by
that
time
whether
there
was
any
basis
to
claim
fraud
or
not.
but
fraud
is
not
in
issue.
therefore,
it
is
not
essential
for
the
service
to
seek
for
evidence
of
intent.
and
indeed,
the
reply
brief,
i
believe
at
page
19,
disclaims
any
interest
in
the
judgmental
portions
of
these
papers,
which
i
think
is
certainly
a
concession
that
they
are
not
needed
for
those
purposes.
and
so,
if
there
is
no
need
then
i
say
it
is
unfair
to
enforce
the
summons
against
the
taxpayer,
against
his
independent
auditor,
to
compel
the
revelation
of
his
private
thoughts
as
to
his
strategies
in
audit
and
in
litigation.
and
that's...
this
court
in
a
recent
case
involving
an
irs
summons,
the
badgett
case,
adverted
to
considerations
of
fundamental
fairness
in
the
context
of
the
enforcement
of
an
irs
summons.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
under
this
aspect
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
yes,
your
honor,
they
would
be.
under
the
alternate
ground,
the
additional
ground,
which
is
the
intrusion
upon
the
independent
auditor's
function,
they
would
not
be
under
that
rationale
because
they're
not
independent.
but
certainly
from
the
point
of
view
of
compelling
the
taxpayer
to
reveal
all
in
this
adversarial
process
to
the
irs
while
the
taxpayer
can't
get
the
same
information
from
the
irs,
it
would
be
most
unfair.
and
that
was
the
situation,
your
honor,
that
was
involved,
of
course,
in
el
paso,
where
the
papers
had
been
prepared
internally.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
will
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
the
service
overreaches
in
this
instance
by
seeking
the
aid
of
the
court
to
compel
the
taxpayer
to,
and
his
independent
auditor
to,
reveal
his
strategies
for
dealing
with
an
adversary.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
well,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
there
are
figures
in
the
taxpayer's
books
and
records
with
respect
to
the
composition
of
the
reserve,
if
it
is
flagged
so
much
for
this,
so
much
for
that,
certainly
the
irs
could
obtain
them.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
i
would
say
not,
your
honor,
because
that
gets
into
judgmental
private
thoughts
and
not
the
facts
as
booked.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
that
would
make
it
more
difficult,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
eldred
jackson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
could
not
differ
from
that.
but
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
here.
here
what
is
involved
is
not
the
normal
aspects
of
a
tax
audit
in
which
the
auditor
seeks...
the
irs
seeks
to
determine
whether
there's
liability
and
if
so
the
amount.
this
is
a
far
more
intrusive
process,
and
i
would
not
want
the
members
of
the
court
to
feel
that
in
some
way
this
privilege
which
we
are
arguing
for
is
meant
to
serve
as
a
cover
for
nefariousness
or
for
deliberate
tax
evasion.
that
is
not
at
all...
this
was
not
at
all
in
the
mind
of
the
second
circuit.
but,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices,
as
you
all
know
probably
from
personal
experience
how
difficult
the
internal
revenue
code
is
to
read,
let
alone
understand,
with
its
qualifications
and
its
exceptions
and
its
cross-references
and
what-not.
and
there
exist
many
times
good
faith
grounds
for
differences
of
opinion
as
to
whether
a
given
transaction
is,
say,
subject
to
normal
regular
income
or
capital
gains
treatment.
and
these
are
the
areas
in
which
we
think
that
the
private
thoughts
of
the
taxpayer,
often
informed
and
assisted
by
his
counsel
as
well
as
his
independent
auditor,
should
not
be
subject
to
the
intrusion
of
the
irs,
and
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
do
so,
because
as
the
second
circuit
found,
and
i
think
common
experience
bears
this
out,
the
relationship
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
service
is
at
heart
adversarial.
certainly
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
a
large
corporation
which
is
audited
automatically,
constantly,
and
the
service...
they
are
constantly
having
differences
over
the
treatment
of
certain
items,
and
the
service's
intent
is
obviously
to
maximize
tax
liability,
the
intent
of
the
taxpayer
is
to
take
advantage
of
all
lawful
provisions
in
the
tax
laws
to
reduce
liability.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
one
word
on
the
subject
of
congress'
intent,
which
was
raised
earlier
during
the
argument.
i
think
congress'
intent
in
this
area
must
be
found
not
only
in
the
tax
laws
and
not
only
in
the
securities
laws,
but
also
in
rule
501
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
was
enacted
pursuant
to
congressional
authority
and
approved
by
congress,
and
that
is
the
rule
which
authorizes...
indeed,
the
legislative
history
shows
invites...
the
federal
courts
to
develop
the
law
of
privilege
under
the
principles
of
the
common
law,
on
the
basis
of
experience
in
cases
where
development
of
new
privileges
are
warranted.
this
is
a
provision
which
the
government
admits
gives
the
courts
the
power
to
develop
new
privileges,
as
the
second
circuit
did.
their
argument
is
that
congress
should
be
the
forum
to
decide
this
issue
before
the
court,
rather
than...
that
is,
the
issue
of
privilege...
rather
than
the
courts.
well,
i
submit
that
is
no
answer.
however
this
court
decides
the
case,
it
will
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other
and
it
will
decide
in
favor
of
one
policy
or
the
other,
in
favor
of
fairness
or
that
fairness
is
not
offended.
this
court
will
be
making
the
decision,
and
indeed
this
is
what
congress
envisioned
in
rule
501.
and
indeed,
even
before
that
rule
was
adopted
this
court
in
the
hickman
case,
which
the
court
below
relied
on
as
an
analogue,
the
court
did
not
leave
the
question
to
congress.
this
court
decided
it
and
held
proper
the
creation
by
the
lower
court
of
the
attorney's
work
product
privilege.
in
short,
your
honors,
we
think
that
the
position
which
is
taken
by
the
government
here
is
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
service
itself
in
its
revised
guidelines
which
permit
access
to
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
only
as
a
last
resort,
only
after
all
other
avenues
of
factual
inquiry
have
been
exhausted,
and
only
on
a
showing
of
particularized
need
for
specific
issues,
not
some
generalized
desire
to
see
whatever
may
turn
up
in
the
tax
accrual
papers.
we
think,
in
short,
that
the
position
of
the
government
on
this
case
is
belied
by
the
position
of
the
service.
we
think
the
government
seeks
to
overreach
and
that
this
court
should
not
countenance
that
result.
