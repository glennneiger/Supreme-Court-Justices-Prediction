mr.
carl
d.
liggio
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
government
seeks
here
is
this
court's
sanctioning
an
invasion
into
the
thought
processes
of
the
independent
auditors
by
obtaining
the
tax
accrual
work
papers.
to
understand
the
issue
that
is
presented
to
this
court,
it
is
essential
to
understand
what
is
in
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
and,
more
importantly,
what
is
not
in
the
tax
accrual
work
papers.
the
tax
accrual
papers
are
prepared
by
the
auditors
and
are
primarily
the
auditors'
opinions,
judgments,
assessments
and
thought
processes
in
determining
whether
the
provision
for
taxes
shown
on
the
financial
statements
of
a
corporate
taxpayer
are
reasonable.
it
is
not
to
determine
whether
the
amount
provided
for
on
the
financial
statements
are
exact
or
the
exact
amount
of
taxes
that
will
eventually
be
paid
by
the
corporate
taxpayer.
they
do
contain
some
facts,
but
these
are
purely
incidental
to
the
judgmental
processes
of
the
auditors
in
evaluating
the
contingency
reserve
for
taxes
on
the
financial
statements.
and,
contrary
to
the
government's
position
which
is
sprinkled
throughout
its
papers
and
in
the
argument
today,
the
facts
comprise
a
very
minimal
or
minor
element.
as
in
the
attorney
work
product
doctrine,
an
analogue
to
which
the
second
circuit
looked
in
drafting
a
carefully
crafted
exception
for
tax
accrual
work
papers,
the
fact
that
there
are
some
facts
incidental
to
the
independent...
the
lawyer's
thought
processes,
does
not
make
the
materials
otherwise
discoverable
unless
there
is
a
particularized
need
shown.
now,
the
components
of
the
tax
accrual
are
essentially
two.
one
is
an
evaluation
of
possible
disallowances
by
the
irs
and
possible
overpayments
by
the
taxpayer.
it
is
not
infrequent
that
in
a
review
of
the
tax
accounts
we
will
find
that
a
client
has
provided
too
much
of
a
tax
reserve
and
will
not
pay
the
taxes
that
it
proposes
to
pay.
the
second
component
is
the
evaluation
of
pending
disputes
with
the
irs,
either
in
the
form
of
existing
revenue
agent
reviews
or
sometimes
in
actual
litigation.
now,
to
make
these
evaluations
the
auditor
must
review
the
corporate
records.
i
note,
it
is
the
same
universe
of
corporate
records
that
are
available
to
the
irs
when
it
conducts
its
audit,
and
in
this
case
the
irs
agents
made
over
400
document
requests
to
amerada,
398
of
which
were
complied
with,
and
amerada
produced
close
to
45,000
pieces
of
paper
to
the
irs
and
expended
some
11,500
person-hours
of
work
prior
to
the
time
that
the
irs
sought
enforcement
of
the
summons
against
arthur
young
&
company.
the
auditor
must
make
a
series
of
judgments
on
worst
case
scenarios,
what
could
happen,
what
might
happen,
what's
the
likelihood
of
something
happening.
but
it
is
a
judgmental
process
reviewing
those
facts.
it
needs
to
discuss
matters
with
the
client's
personnel.
for
example,
if
there's
been
a
revenue
agent
review
and
a
disallowance,
it
needs
to
know
the
client's
position
with
respect
to
that
disallowance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
client
has
provided
for
a
potential
tax
liability
or
whether
the
client
intends
to
fight
it.
it
is
not
infrequent
that
we
will
find
statements
in
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
such
as,
the
client
will
pay
and
let
someone
else
litigate
and
preserve
a
claim
for
refund.
similarly,
there
may
already
be
a
litigation
and
we
will
have
counsel's
opinion
in
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
on
the
potential
outcome
of
that
litigation.
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
statements
in
there
from
counsel
to
the
effect
that,
although
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
and
we
believe
the
client
should
prevail,
we
nevertheless
recommend
that
the
client
settle
this
matter
in
the
following
amount.
the
tax
accrual
papers,
therefore,
are
an
amalgam
of
opinions
and
only
incidentally,
as
i
noted,
do
they
contain
facts.
the
government's
speculation
on
this
is
unsupported
by
the
record
below.
in
addition,
contrary
to
the
government's
reply
brief,
the
fact
that
an
item
is
included
in
the
contingency
reserve
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
about
the
correctness
of
the
return.
rather,
it
means
that
we
are
trying
to
evaluate
the
totality
of
the
reserve
in
relationship
to
all
the
other
accounts
on
the
financial
statements
for
the
reasonableness
of
it.
as
i
noted
at
the
start,
it
is
not
the
taxes
that
we
think
the
client
will
necessarily
pay,
but
whether
the
amount
provided
for
in
the
financial
statements
bears
a
reasonable
relationship.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
excuse
me?
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
i'm
talking
about
arthur
young
&
company.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
the
independent
auditor,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
well,
the
client
has
the
first
responsibility
for
providing
that
provision
in
the
tax
return.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
that
is
correct.
it
does
not
include
counsel.
it
is
the
independent
audit
process,
the
evaluation
of
the
financial
statements.
counsel
may
be
included,
as
it
was
in
the
el
paso
case,
in
that
evaluative
process
and
in
providing
information
to
the
auditor.
but
basically
i
am
looking
at
this
as
a
function
of
the
independent
auditor
in
evaluating
the
financial
statement.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it's
legal
advice,
although
in
the
el
paso
case
it
clearly
was.
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
issue
here.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
there
may
be
lawyers
in
our
tax
department,
but
they
are
not
lawyers
acting
as
lawyers.
they
are
acting
as
certified
public
accounts.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
well,
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
what
in
reality
the
court
did,
and
we
may
be
getting
into
semantics,
is
as
the
third
circuit
did
in
hickman
and
this
court
did
in
1947,
it
created
a
doctrine
and
it
weighed
the
competing
interests
that
were
necessary.
now,
whether
we
call
it
a
privilege
or
whether
we
call
it
a
doctrine,
i
think
the
label
is
unimportant.
it
is
what
the
court
in
fact
did,
and
it
weighed
those
competing
interests,
and
i
believe
that
is
an
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
well,
in
part
that
is
here
also,
your
honor,
although
the
analogy
to
the
work
product
doctrine,
i
think
it's
an
analogue.
but
there
is
that
element
of
unfairness
that's
here
and
i
think
that
is
inherently
the
problem
with
the
access
to
the
tax
accrual
work
papers,
because
we
are
making
evaluations
and
judgments.
we're
not
saying...
and
&
company.
arthur
young
is
not
saying
that
in
this
set
of
circumstances
this
is
the
tax
liability
that
the
client
has
to
pay.
arthur
young
and
any
independent
auditor
is
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
amount
of
taxes
that
have
been
booked
and
provided
for
in
the
financial
statements
and
they're
saying,
is
it
reasonable
that
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
pay
this
over
a
course
of
time.
there
are
deferred
taxes
in
there,
there
are
current
taxes,
there
are
disallowances
that
are
being
litigated.
and
it
has
in
that
process
many
judgments.
it
has
the
independent
lawyer's
opinion
who
is
handling
the
litigation.
it
has
the
client's
judgment
on
how
it's
going
to
fight
or
what
it
intends
to
do
with
the
service.
and
you
have
very
much
an
adversarial
process
there
that
will
be
invaded
when
you
allow
the
irs
to
get
access
to
the
tax
accrual
work
papers.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
no,
justice
o'connor,
there's
no
claim
that
they
were
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
well,
first,
justice
o'connor,
depending
on
the
circumstances
they
may
or
may
not
be
obtainable
by
the
sec
or
by
the
private
litigant.
in
any
event,
because
of
a
question
raised
by
section
7216
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
has
been
arthur
young's
position
that
we
cannot
make
those
papers
available
without
a
court
order.
otherwise
we
would
be
liable
for
criminal
sanctions.
this
provision
relates
to
parties
other
than
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
in
that
set
of
circumstances
we
would,
although
we've
never
had
the
situation
today,
we
would
seek
an
appropriate
protective
order
limiting
the
disclosure
of
the
materials
to
the
irs
or
any
other
party.
now,
i
note
72--
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
--well,
whether
the
sec
would
be
entitled
to
it
would
be
whether
this
was
a
proper
subject
matter
of
sec
investigation.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
then
in
that
case
they
would
be
entitled
to
obtain
it,
having
made
the
relevancy
showing,
and
we
would
seek
an
appropriate
protective
order
limiting
the
disclosure
that
the
sec
could
otherwise
make
to
that.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
because,
your
honor,
the
irs...
the
purpose
for
which
these
are
prepared
and
the
effect
that
will
result
from
that
is
materially
different.
in
the
sec
context,
we
are
dealing
with
whether
or
not
the
financial
statements
are
fairly
presented
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
and
the
access
to
that
information
by
the
irs
does
not
put
the
corporate
client
in
a
substantial
disadvantage.
it
is
not
unfair,
inherently
unfair,
to
allow
the
sec
access.
the
irs,
it
is.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
i
don't
think
that
should
change
the
result,
justice
o'connor.
but
as
a
practical
matter
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
are
not
given
to
the
client.
they
are
our
work
product,
our
audit
work
papers.
basically
what
the
service
seeks
here
is
the
opinions
and
judgments.
as
judge
garwood
said
in
his
dissent
in
el
paso,
what
the
service
wants
is
the
private
thoughts
and
theories
of
the
accountants
and
the
taxpayers.
the
bottom
line
is
the
convenience
of
the
service.
and
not
only
is
the
tension
imposed
upon
the
auditor-client
relationship
by
allowing
the
irs
to
conscript
the
auditors
into
becoming
the
service's
stalking
horse
when
you
allow
access
to
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
self-evident,
but
the
public
record
is
equally
clear
that
it
has
had
and
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
audit
process
and
the
quality
of
financial
reporting.
the
irs
challenges
the
second
circuit's
finding
with
respect
to
this
as
speculative
and
denigrates
the
affidavits
submitted
below
in
part
of
this
record,
as
well
as
the
substantial
commentary
that
has
been
written
on
the
subject
by
members
of
the
private
bar
and
the
accounting
profession
as
purely
an
evidence
of
self-interest.
yet
the
government
is
conspicuously
silent
on
commissioner
egger's
own
recognition
that
this
problem,
the
access
to
the
tax
accrual
work
papers,
the
opinions
and
judgments
of
the
auditors,
had
reached
such
emotional
proportions
that
it
had
real
potential
for
negative
effects
on
the
quality
of
financial
reporting.
it
ignores
the
presence
of
the
amici,
the
other
major
accounting
firms
and
the
aicpa,
which
have
pointed
out
the
existence
of
this
problem.
it
ignores
the
reports
in
the
public
press
on
the
problem
that
has
happened.
and
it
ignores
the
aicpa
study
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
published
in
the
journal
of
accountancy
in
1981,
showing
that
in
fact
there
was
a
deterioration
of
the
relationship
between--
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
--no,
justice
powell.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
no,
justice
powell.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
level
of
candor,
the
amount
of
information--
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
--by
the
corporate
client.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
the
willingness
to
open
up
and
come
to
us
with
the
problems,
to
discuss
issues,
to
say:
we've
got
this
irs
dispute,
we're
going
to
litigate
it
or
we're
going
to
settle
it,
we're
going
to
settle
it
for
60
cents
on
the
dollar.
i
suggest
we
wouldn't
have
that
information.
it
would
be
like
pulling
teeth,
and
it
would
make
the
audit
process
substantially
more
difficult.
and
it
has
in
fact
happened.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
justice
powell--
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
--the
fact
is
that
the
onus
of
the
irs
potential
access
to
this
is
a
very
debilitating
factor
in
the
relationship,
no
matter
how
good
it's
been
with
our
clients
over
the
years.
as
a
practical
matter,
we
saw
it
when
the
service
started
subpoenaing
the
tax
accrual
work
papers,
and
if
they
were
to
have
that
access
again
to
get
into
these
judgmental
processes
i
sincerely
believe
that
we're
going
to
have
that
problem
again.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
that's
correct,
your
honor,
if
we
did
not
have
adequate
information.
but
that's
only
if
we
thought
the
financial
statements
might
be
materially
wrong.
there
is
a
range
within
they
could
be
correct
and
we
would
not
necessarily
have
to
qualify
the
accounts
on
that
basis.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
well,
with
all
deference,
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
sure
we
will
in
fact
get
all
the
information.
and
part
of
it
is
of
necessity
that
the
client
volunteers
things
to
us,
and
that
level
of
communication
we
are
convinced
is
going
to
be
shut
off.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
yes.
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
they
would
in
the
first
instance
be
subject
to
the
attorney-client
privilege,
justice
o'connor.
and
in
the
second
instance,
we
believe
that
they
would
not
lose
their
privileged
characteristic
by
showing
them
to
the
independent
auditor.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
all--
mr.
carl
d.
liggio
--the
privilege
that
i'm
talking
about
is
the
attorney-client
privilege
in
the
first
instance,
and
the
fact
that
they
may
be
shown
to
the
independent
auditor
we
do
not
believe
would
lose
the
quality
of
that
privilege.
as
i
say,
there
are
some
district
court
cases
unreported
that
have
in
fact
said
the
privilege
is
not
lost
under
those
circumstances.
