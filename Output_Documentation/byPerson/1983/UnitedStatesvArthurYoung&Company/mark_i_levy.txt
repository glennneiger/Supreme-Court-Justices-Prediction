mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
accountant
privilege
should
be
created
to
shield
from
the
irs
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
that
were
prepared
by
an
independent
public
accountant
in
connection
with
his
audit
of
a
publicly
held
corporation
pursuant
to
the
federal
securities
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
established
such
a
privilege
and
on
that
basis
denied
enforcement
of
the
irs
summons
for
the
tax
accrual
work
papers.
this
marks
the
first
and
only
occasion
that
any
federal
accountant
privilege
has
ever
been
adopted.
the
background
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
stated.
the
federal
securities
laws
require
that
publicly
held
corporations,
such
as
amerada
hess,
file
financial
statements
that
have
been
audited
and
certified
by
an
independent
certified
public
accountant.
under
generally
accepted
accounting
principles,
the
corporation
must
accrue
as
a
charge
to
earnings
a
reserve
for
contingent
tax
liabilities.
this
reflects
the
possibility
that
the
corporation
will
owe
more
in
taxes
than
it
paid.
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards,
the
independent
public
auditors
must
determine
the
adequacy
of
this
reserve
in
order
to
certify
that
the
financial
statement
fairly
presents
the
financial
condition
of
the
corporation
and
was
prepared
in
conformity
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
federal
law
requires
that
the
financial
statement
be
audited
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
auditing
standards.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct,
and
then
it
is
incorporated,
as
it
were,
into
the
sec
regulations.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case.
our
position
would
be
the
same,
that
the
irs
is
entitled
to
those
work
papers.
that
case
would
not
raise
the
dimension
that
this
one
does
about
the
conflict
that
the
court
of
appeals
perceived
between
the
tax
laws
and
the
securities
laws.
in
that
situation
there
would
only
be
the
unfairness
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
sustain
any
claim
to
privilege.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
i
think
it's
really
more
that
the
accounting
firm's
arguments
would
be
inapplicable
in
that
situation.
they
are
the
ones
who
have
to
come
forward
and
justify
the
privilege,
and
one
of
the
grounds
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
in
sustaining
the
privilege
here
was
that
to
allow
the
irs
to
have
access
to
these
papers
would
in
some
way
undermine
the
securities
laws.
that
simply
would
not
be
a
problem
in
the
hypothetical.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
it
would
be
inapplicable
in
the
sense
that
we
wouldn't
need
to
respond
to
that
argument.
in
that
situation,
justice
blackmun,
essentially
the
argument
would
be
that
there
is
some
sort
of
an
accountant
privilege
that
shields
in-house
work
by
a
corporation.
that's
an
issue
that
could
be
litigated,
but
we
think
it's
very
unlikely
that
any
court
would
recognize
a
privilege
in
those
circumstances.
there
are
some
cases,
i
should
add,
that
approach
the
hypothetical
that
you
put.
the
el
paso
case
that's
pending
here
on
certiorari
here
involved
in-house
auditors,
but
their
work
was
done
in
connection
with
a
public
securities
review.
the
case
the
eleventh
circuit
recently
decided,
in
re
newton,
did
involve
a
closely
held
non-public
corporation,
but
the
auditors
in
that
case
were
outside
auditors
rather
than
in-house
auditors,
so
that
they
approach
but
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
your
hypothetical,
justice
blackmun.
in
this
case,
the
irs
was
conducting
a
tax
investigation
of
respondent
amerada
hess.
respondent
arthur
young
is
the
independent
public
auditor
that
audited
and
certified
amerada
hess'
financial
statement
for
the
years
in
question.
the
irs
issued
a
summons
to
arthur
young
for,
among
other
things,
the
tax
accrual
work
papers.
arthur
young,
acting
both
at
its
own
instance
and
at
the
directions
of
amerada
hess,
declined
to
comply
with
the
summons.
the
government
then
brought
this
enforcement
action
in
district
court.
the
district
court
held
that
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
are
relevant
and
not
privileged
and
it
ordered
that
they
be
produced.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed.
although
it
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
are
relevant,
it
held
that
they
are
protected
by
an
accountant
privilege
and
that
the
government
had
not
made
an
adequate
showing
to
overcome
that
privilege.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
it
was
a
joint
civil-criminal
investigation
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
our
case
would
be
materially
different.
we
think
the
irs
has
summons
authority
to
get
these
work
papers
in
a
civil
case,
in
a
criminal
case,
or
in
a
joint
investigation.
now,
our
case
would
be
stronger,
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
if
the
irs
were
investigating
fraud
or
some
other
state
of
mind
issue,
there
would
be
no
privilege
for
the
work
papers,
and
in
a
criminal
investigation
that
is
much
more
likely,
of
course,
to
arise.
but
it
could
also
come
up
in
a
civil
investigation
as
well.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
fundamental
mistake
in
saying
that
because
the
irs
had
not
alleged
fraud
at
the
time
it
issued
the
summons,
then
the
privilege
applied.
that
put
the
cart
before
the
horse,
since
the
whole
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
basis
for
liability,
including
penalties
for
fraud
or
any
other
violation.
so
that
would
be
the
difference
if
there
were
a
criminal
case
here,
and
the
court
of
appeals
simply
ignored
the
fact
that
this
was
a
joint
civil-criminal
investigation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
yes,
a
special
agent
does
investigate
for
criminal
purposes.
but
the
court
of
appeals
put
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
in
that
investigation
the
irs
had
not
made
any
allegations
of
fraud
in
issuing
the
summons.
we
think
that
was
a
mistake.
the
irs
should
have
the
authority
to
get
these
work
papers
for,
among
other
reasons,
to
determine
whether
there's
any
basis
for
an
allegation
of
fraud,
and
the
government
can't
make
that
allegation
before
it
conducts
its
investigation.
the
court
of
appeals'
creation
of
an
accountant
privilege
in
this
case
rested
on
two
theories:
first,
that
irs
access
to
tax
accrual
work
papers
would
be
unfair
and
prejudicial
to
the
taxpayer;
and
second,
that
irs
access
would
chill
candor
in
communications
between
the
corporation
and
the
independent
public
auditor,
and
that
this
would
work
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
investing
public
and
be
contrary
to
the
policies
of
the
securities
laws.
and
me
consider
each
of
these
theories
in
turn.
but
even
taken
together,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
too
expansive
a
view
of
its
role
to
weigh
competing
policy
considerations
against
the
government's
entitlement
to
obtain
information
pursuant
to
statute,
and
that
neither
of
its
theories
justifies
the
creation
of
a
novel
accountant
privilege
or
overcomes
the
strong
presumption
in
the
law
against
the
establishment
of
a
new
privilege.
first,
the
claim
of
unfairness.
this
claim
seems
to
derive
from
one
of
three
sources,
that
irs
access
here
is
unfair:
one,
because
of
something
about
the
process
or
the
balance
of
advantage
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
irs
in
a
tax
investigation;
or
two,
because
something
in
the
relationship
between
the
corporation
and
its
independent
public
auditor
makes
it
unfair;
or
three,
that
there's
something
in
the
contents
of
the
work
papers
that
makes
it
unfair
for
the
irs
to
summon
these.
i'll
address
each
of
these
in
turn.
the
claim
that
the
process
of
tax
investigation
makes
it
unfair
for
the
irs
to
have
access
must
be
assessed
in
the
context
of
our
self-reporting
tax
system.
irs
enforcement
of
the
tax
laws
serves
two
basic
purposes:
first,
it
furthers
the
fundamental
government
interest
in
collecting
revenues;
and
second,
it
achieves
equity
among
taxpayers
by
ensuring
that
a
taxpayer
who
fully
complies
voluntarily
is
not
put
at
a
disadvantage
in
relation
to
a
less
scrupulous
taxpayer.
now,
under
our
tax
system
the
taxpayer
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
pay
his
fair
share
of
taxes
and
to
compile
and
to
provide
to
the
government
a
great
deal
of
information
to
demonstrate
his
compliance
with
the
law.
that's
the
nature
of
the
tax
system.
while
it
is
of
course
often
true
that
the
irs
and
the
taxpayer
may
have
opposing
views,
the
nature
of
the
tax
system
is
not
arm's
length
or
adversarial
in
the
same
sense
that
a
system
of
litigation
is.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
so,
and
i
believe
everything
that's
in
my
presentation--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
it
helps
to
support
the
government's
position
here
to
realize
what
is
at
stake
in
withholding
access
to
these
papers
from
the
irs.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
let
me
move
on
from
that,
then.
whatever
may
be
true
in
the
litigation
area,
there
is
no
room
in
a
tax
investigation
system
for
a
sporting
theory
of
justice
that
requires
that
the
relative
advantages
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
irs
be
equalized.
a
tax
investigation
is
not
a
competitive
event
like
a
horse
race
or
a
golf
match,
in
which
each
of
the
participants
has
to
bear
an
equalizing
handicap.
the
fundamental
point
here,
to
get
to
it,
is
that...
is
whether
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
will
be
available
to
help
to
ensure
that
all
facts
and
all
issues
are
brought
out
into
the
open
so
that
the
irs
can
form
a
judgment
about
the
taxpayer's
tax
liabilities
and
any
issues
can
be
resolved
through
the
processes
provided
by
law.
there's
no
room
for
the
taxpayer
to
complain,
as
respondents
do
here,
that
the
irs'
enforcement
is
too
effective
or
that
the
relevant
information
will
be
too
helpful
to
the
irs
in
determining
the
taxpayer's
liability.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no
one,
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
respondents,
have
identified
anything
in
the
congressional
intent
that
would
support
a
privilege
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
it
is
rather
a
point
of
fundamental
fairness
they
claim.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
we
think
that
it
was
a
misconception
about
the
role
of
the
judiciary,
that
he
thought
that
it
was
the
proper
role
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
weigh
competing
social
policies
against
the
statutory
access
authorized
by
congress
and
conferred
on
the
service.
we
think
that
was
a
fundamental
misapproach
to
the
case.
but
at
least
as
to
this
side
of
it,
on
the
unfairness
argument,
he
identified
nothing
in
the
statute
or
any
legislative
history
that
would
support
a
privilege,
and
we
think
this
court's
opinions
point
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction,
that
congress
wanted
the
irs
to
have
the
broadest
possible
access
and
to
be
able
to
have
every
helpful
and
effective
means
of
enforcing
the
tax
laws.
now,
the
claim
of
unfairness
may
also
rest
in
part
not
on
this
balance
of
advantage,
but
on
the
idea
that
irs
access
will
intrude
into
a
sensitive
relation
between
the
accountant
and
the
corporation
that
the
law
should
protect.
we
think
this
is
simply
not
so.
in
couch
this
court
recognized
that
there
is
no
federal
accountant-client
privilege,
and
thus--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
a
harder
case
and
raise
issues
that
haven't
been
addressed
here
about
the
role
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
waiver
of
the
attorney-client
privilege.
to
give
you
my--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--well,
we
think
it
is
not
close
to
the
attorney's
role,
really,
for
two
fundamental
reasons.
the
attorney
has
an
undivided
duty
of
loyalty
to
his
client.
that's
the
basic
nature
of
the
relationship.
the
accountant,
on
the
other
hand,
does
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
that's
why
it
would
raise
hard
questions
about
whether
the
privilege
applied
in
the
first
instance,
whether
he
was
giving
confidential
legal
advice
on
behalf
of
the
client
or,
even
if
he
were,
whether
it
would
be
waived
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
i
think
our
position
might
be
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
opinion
there,
but
as
i
say
that
raises
issues
that
haven't
been
addressed
in
this
case.
this
case
only
involves
an
accountant
whose
duty,
whose
paramount
duty,
is
to
the
public,
including
the
government
and
investors
and
creditors
as
well.
the
nature
of
the
advice
is
also
quite
different.
the
lawyer
in
general
gives
confidential
advice
and
formulates
strategy
for
the
client.
here
the
accountant,
his
function
is
not
to
give
advice.
his
role
is
to
be
independent
and
he
serves
as
an
instrument
of
public
oversight
and
investigation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
believe
it
is
disputed.
it's
supported
by
the
affidavits
below,
as
well
as
by
public--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i'm
saying
that
when
they're
acting
as
an
independent
public
auditor
in
connection
with
the
securities
laws,
their
obligation
is
to
the
public
and
it
is
not
one
of
giving
confidential
advice.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
in
this
case
as
it
comes
to
the
court
there
is
only
one
kind
of
paper
that's
involved,
the
tax
accrual
work
papers,
and
we
think
it
is
fundamentally
involved
in
resolving
the
issue
whether
the
irs
should
have
access.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
would
be
a
different
case,
although
we
think
couch
recognizes
that
there
is
no
general
accountant-client
privilege.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
he's
performing
a
role
as
an
independent
public
auditor,
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--difference.
i
don't
believe
so.
his
obligation
is
to
the
public.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
if
it's
in
connection
with
a
certification
of
a
public
financial
statement
i
think
there
would
be
questions
about
whether
the
lawyer's
advice
would
be
privileged.
those
questions
aren't
involved
here,
but
they
touch
on
the
points
that
mr.
justice
stevens
raised.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
but
there
would
be
difficult
questions
about
whether
the
privilege
applies
and,
even
if
it
applies,
whether
it
would
be
waived
by
disclosing
it
to
a
quasi-public
person.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
as
i
say,
that
would
raise
different
questions,
and
some
of
those
questions
are
presented
in
the
el
paso
case,
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
there,
at
a
minimum,
was
a
waiver
of
any
attorney
privilege
by
disclosing
it
to
the
outside
auditor.
but
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
respondents
have
raised
any
of
those
kinds
of
issues
in
this
case.
the
accountant
privilege
here
stands
on
a
different
footing.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
they
haven't
been
raised.
this
case
is
really
no
different
than
if
the
securities
laws
provided
that
the
sec
would
select
the
outside
auditor,
rather
than
letting
a
corporation
do
it,
or
indeed
even
if
the
sec
would
do
the
outside
audit
itself.
in
those
cases,
clearly
there
could
be
no
claim
that
the
irs
was
seeking
to
intrude
into
some
sensitive
confidential
relationship
that
the
law
should
protect.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
their
obligation
is
to
be
every
bit
as
forthcoming
here,
and
the
whole
point
of
this
illustration
is
that
the
independent
public
auditor
stands
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
the
sec
would.
the
obligation
for
the
corporation
to
make
full,
accurate,
and
complete
disclosure
so
that
the
accountant
can
certify
the
financial
statement
would
be
exactly
the
same
in
the
two
instances.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
regret,
mr.
justice
powell,
but
i'm
not
fully
familiar
with
the
lawyer's
obligations
in
those
circumstances.
but
i
would
say
that
if
they
are
comparable
to
the
role
of
the
independent
public
auditor
in
this
case,
those
would
raise
very
serious
questions
about
whether
a
privilege
would
apply
or
whether
it
would
be
waived.
but
i
am
simply
not
in
a
position
to
say
anything
more
definitive
because
i
do
not
know
their
full
obligations.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
is
room
for
judgment,
no
question,
in
these
papers,
although
judgment
is
not
the
only
or
even
the
predominant
content
of
the
papers.
but
there
is
no,
at
the
same
time,
privilege
for
professional
opinions.
work
product
protection
is
not
a
badge
of
professional
status
that
attaches
simply
because
a
professional
is
involved
and
renders
advice.
there
need
to
be
substantially
more
important,
compelling
reasons
of
public
policy
and
law
to
justify
it,
as
in
the
attorney
work
product
area
of
hickman
against
taylor.
in
that
circumstance
the
attorney
did
give
confidential
advice
and
his
very
role
was
to
provide
the
client
with
strategy
in
litigation.
the
court
recognized
that
the
whole
basis
for
the
adversarial
system
of
law
was
that
the
lawyer
needed
a
certain
private
domain,
a
certain
thinking
and
working
space,
in
order
to
perform
his
functions.
in
addition,
the
attorney
work
product
requires
that
the
materials
be
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
that
is,
that
they
were
prepared
for
the
very
purpose
of
a
party
defending
its
position
and
opposing
the
claim
of
the
other
side.
it
is
not
enough
that
the
attorney
is
involved
for
some
other
reason
or
that
the
material
might
have
some
effect
on
the
lawsuit.
they
have
to
have
been
prepared
for
the
very
purpose
of
resolving
the
adversarial
dispute.
in
this
case
once
again,
the
role
of
the
independent
public
auditor
is
much
different.
again,
we
have
the
self-reporting
tax
system
that
imposes
a
duty
of
disclosure
on
the
taxpayer.
the
independent
public
auditor
does
not
give
confidential
advice
and
strategy.
he
does
not
need
the
same
private
domain
that
the
lawyer
does.
indeed,
the
tax
accrual
work
papers
are
prepared
with
the
very
idea
in
mind
that
they
will
be
subject
to
disclosure
if
a
challenge
later
arises
under
the
securities
laws.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
would
raise
different
questions,
but
i
think
in
the
end
fundamentally
not.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
right,
because
the
obligations
under
the
securities
laws
are
not
private
confidential
advice-giving
ones,
as
lawyers--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
expect
they
do,
and
i
also
imagine
that
many
of
these
cpa's
are
attorneys
as
well.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
make--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
expect
that
that
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
may
be
true
as
to
some
particular
type
of
information,
and
that
is
the
discussion
i
had
with
justice
stevens
and
justice
marshall,
i
think.
but
i
understood
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
to
be
that
the
work
was
done
exactly
the
same,
but
it
happened
that
the
person
who
did
it
was
both
an
accountant
and
a
lawyer.
in
those
circumstances,
the
fact
that
a
lawyer,
someone
with
legal
as
well
as
accounting
training,
is
involved
does
not
change
the
existence
of
the
privilege
in
any
way.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
that
is
not
all
we're
talking
about.
the
summons
in
this
case
was
directed
for
both
the
civil
and
the
criminal
investigation,
and
the
affidavits
in
the
court
below
that
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
make
it
clear
that
both
sides
of
the
investigation
are
still
open
and
that
the
summons
here
is
relevant
to
both
parts.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
be
able
to
answer
that.
i
think
that
the
government's
overriding
interest
is
in
having
full
disclosure
so
that
all
facts
and
issues
can
come
out
and
that
a
reasoned
decision
can
be
made
about
any
tax
liability
and
any
issues
that
arise
can
be
worked
out
through
the
normal
processes
of
the
law.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
if
the
balance
sheet
itself
disclosed
certain
things,
then
that
would
be
of
substantial
assistance
to
the
irs.
but
as
i
understand
it,
both
the
requirements
of
the
profession
and
the
implementation
of
those
requirements
are
somewhat
vague.
there's
room
for
discretion
and
the
practices
among
the
accountant
firms
vary
quite
widely
about
the
degree
of
detail
that's
disclosed.
i
did,
for
example,
look
at
the
amerada
hess
10k's
in
this
case
and
did
not
see
any
separate
item
even
for
tax
accrual
liabilities,
let
alone
broken
down
by
the
kind
of
item.
let
me
just
touch
briefly
on
the
second
half
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning,
that
there
is
some
perceived
conflict
between
the
securities
laws
and
the
tax
laws
and
that
irs
access
here
would
chill
the
candor
of
communications
between
the
corporation
and
the
auditor.
this
is
clearly
in
the
nature
of
an
accountant-client
communication
privilege
and
we
think
therefore
inconsistent
with
couch.
we
also
think
it's
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
st.
regis
paper,
that
holds
that
a
statute
is
not
to
be
read
to
create
a
privilege
unless
it
clearly
so
provides.
there's
nothing
in
the
securities
laws
here
that
establishes
a
privilege
or
cuts
back
on
the
irs
summons
the
service
would
otherwise
have.
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
on
this
point
was
quite
speculative.
they
may
be
right
that
in
some
circumstances
there
will
be
some
effect
on
some
corporations
in
their
communications
with
their
auditors.
but
beyond
that
no
generalization
is
possible,
and
there
was
no
adequate
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
broader
generality.
indeed,
there's
substantial
room
for
doubting
whether
the
absence
of
a
privilege
would
have
any
effect
on
compliance
with
the
securities
laws,
because
both
the
corporation
and
the
auditor
are
under
independent
legal
duties
to
perform
their
functions
in
accordance
with
the
securities
laws.
in
particular,
the
auditor
will
not
give
an
unqualified
opinion
if
he
is
not
satisfied
that
the
financial
statement
fairly
presents
the
financial
condition
and
has
not
had
access
to
adequate
information
on
which
to
form
a
judgment.
that
provides
him
with
a
strong
means
to
obtain
the
cooperation
of
the
corporation
in
getting
access
to
the
necessary
materials.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
it
is
not
frequently.
i
cannot
give
you
a
quantitative
estimate,
but
the
irs
by
no
means
seeks
in
the
routine
or
the
ordinary
course
to
get
these
work
papers.
but
we
think
the
fact
that
the
irs
exercises
discretion
with
restraint
and
forebearance
does
not
in
any
way
undermine
its
legal
right
to
obtain
these
cases
where
it
sees
fit.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
i
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
