unknown
speaker
now,
federal
law
doesn't
require
that;
that's
a
matter
of
accounting
standards,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
that
just
is
determined
by
the
practice
of
the
accountants
generally,
not
by
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
would
your
position
be
any
different
if
this
were
a
small
closely
held
corporation,
not
listed?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
some
of
your
arguments
here
would
be
inapplicable
in
that
situation,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
some
of
your
arguments
be
inapplicable,
to
wit,
the
duty
owed
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
a
special
agent
had
shown
up
before
the
summons
was
issued,
hadn't
he?
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
stronger
if
he
hadn't
appeared?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
appearance
of
a
special
agent
has
criminal
case
overtones.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
hasn't
this
court
gone
into
this
about
a
thousand
times
by
now,
the
great
theory
of
the
irs?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
need
it
for
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it's
up
to
you.
it's
your
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
question
basically
of
congressional
intent,
i
suppose,
isn't
it?
you
know,
how
effective
did
congress
intend
these
procedures
to
be,
and
did
congress
perhaps
imply
that
there
might
be
some
room
for
this
kind
of
privilege?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
reason,
then,
do
you
think
that
judge
feinberg
thought
supported
his
opinion
if
it
weren't
some
implicit
congressional
intent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here.
supposing...
well,
i
guess
the
federal
securities
laws
require
an
opinion
of
a
lawyer
on
contingent
liabilities
in
litigation,
or
it
very
well
could.
supposing
in
this
particular
situation
the
statute,
instead
of
asking
for
an
accountant's
opinion,
asked
for
a
legal
opinion
on
the
adequacy
of
the
reserve
for
contingent
tax
liabilities,
and
all
the
other...
everything
else
about
the
case
was
exactly
the
same.
what
would
your
view
be
about
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't...
of
course,
it's
an
accountant,
not
a
lawyer,
and
it's
kind
of
a
semi-legal
judgment
that
he
has
to
make
in
interpreting
tax
laws.
and
as
we
all
know,
accountants
probably
practice
more
tax
law
than
lawyers
do.
so
i
just
wonder
if
it
really
isn't
very
close
to
the
case
of
asking
the
legal
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
the
hypothetical
statute
i've
posited
he
would
have
a
duty
of
giving
an
opinion
on
which
the
public
would
rely.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
regarding
that
part
of
your
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you're
stating
now
what
the
accountant's
role
is,
that
he
doesn't
give
advice
like
lawyers
do.
i
mean,
is
this
a
matter
of
public
record
or
do
we
take
judicial
knowledge
of
some
of
this
differentiation
that
you
see
between
the
role
of
accountants
and
lawyers?
or
is
it
disputed?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
a
lot
of
accountants,
cpa's,
do
not
give
legal
advice,
about
tax
liability?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
function
is
wound
up
in
both
of
these
kinds
of
papers
that
are
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
even
if
for
other
purposes
they
give
advice
about
what
tax
liability
is?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
what
would
happen
if
the
accountant
was
in
a
legal
office?
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
accountant
was
in
a
legal
law
office?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
lawyer
and
the
accountant
advising
the
client,
the
lawyer
is
privileged
but
the
accountant
is
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what
got
me
on
this
tangent.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would...
i
know
this
is
way
out
in
left
field.
what
would
happen
if
the
lawyer
gave
the
opinion
that
the
accountant
should
have
given?
would
that
be
privileged?
unknown
speaker
they're
not
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
statute
did
provide
it,
i
dare
say
that
the
corporations
involved
might
not
be
quite
as
forthcoming
with
the
sec
as
they
were
with
their
own,
or
who
they
thought
were
their
own
accountants.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
of
course
lawyers,
just
as
accountants,
file
opinions
with
registration
statements
with
the
sec.
how
do
you
draw
the
distinction
between
a
lawyer's
certification,
for
example,
that
an
issue
of
securities
has
been
validly
authorized
and
is
lawful
and
outstanding,
and
an
accountant's
certificate
that
a
balance
sheet
and
a
profit
and
loss
statement
are
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
more
of
an
opinion
expressed
by
counsel
than
perhaps
by
an
accountant,
although
where
you're
dealing
with
a
tax
accrual
estimate
that
finally
comes
down
to
an
opinion,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
supposing
that
we
reverse
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
and
then
a
new
breed
of
service
comes
into
effect,
the
lawyer-accountant,
which
does
all
the
same
work
that
cpa's
used
to
do
except
that
the
person
to
whom
the
corporation
talks
is
now
a
lawyer,
and
they
go
about...
a
particular
corporation
consults
one
of
these
entities
and
does
work
only
with
the
lawyer,
but
the
firm
is
functioning
in
the
capacity
just
as
the
cpa's
are
here,
preparing
reports
that
are
required
by
the
sec.
now
then,
would
that
challenge
be
resolved
any
differently
than
this
one?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
well,
after
all,
the
accountants
do
have
lawyers
in
their
organizations,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
some
law
firms
have
certified
public
accountants
in
their
establishment,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
in
response
to
justice
rehnquist's
question,
would
it
not
turn
on
what
the
particular
actions
were?
if
they
were
the
actions
of
a
lawyer
traditionally
it
might
have
one
answer;
if
it
was
a
function
of
an
accountant
it
might
have
a
different
answer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
how
big
was
the
reserve
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
a
reference
in
the
papers
to
$7,000
of
these
foreign
payments.
is
that
all
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
if
in
a
case
of
this
kind
the
government
is
more
interested
in
finding
out
what
the
elements
of
the
contingent
liability
that
are
included
in
the
reserve
are
or
the
ones
that
are
left
out?
which
are
they
primarily
looking
for?
unknown
speaker
i've
seen
some
balance
sheets
where
the
contingency
actually
identifies
the
area
of
potential
controversy,
that
there's
some
fight
over
inventory
or
something
that's
going
to
recur
year
after
year.
but
you're
mainly
thinking
of
things
that
would
be
undisclosed
in
the
balance
sheet
itself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
since
'81
you
have
guidelines.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
how
frequently
requests
are
made
now
under
those
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
you
use
the
term
mr.
liggio.
unknown
speaker
you
use
the
term
"we".
unknown
speaker
you
meant
the
client,
you
meant
amerada?
unknown
speaker
the
auditor,
not
the
client?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
the
"we"
does
not
include
counsel,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
that
it's
legal
advice?
unknown
speaker
and
in
giving
this
information,
this
advice
to
amerada,
arthur
young
&
company
doesn't
use
lawyers
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liggio,
at
one
place
in
your
brief,
on
page
25,
you
say
that
under
these
circumstances,
and
you
describe
it.
it's
the
last
paragraph
of
footnote
15:
"under
these
circumstances,
the
creation
of
a
qualified
privilege
is
a
proper
exercise
of
judicial
discretion.
"
do
you
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here,
kind
of
exercised
its
judicial
discretion
to
create
a
qualified
privilege?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
don't
you...
aren't
you
stuck
by
some
difference
that
mr.
levy
refers
to,
that
the
hickman
case
arose
in
a
context
of
litigation,
where
one
of
the
concurring
opinions
says,
even
if
a
lawyer
lives
by
his
wits
he
shouldn't
have
to
live...
be
able
to
live
by
his
adversary's
wits?
where
there
is
kind
of
an
idea
people
should
be
made
equal,
it's
competitive,
adversarial,
as
opposed
to
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
were
these
papers
prepared
in
your
view
in
anticipation
of
litigation?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
work
papers
were
sought
not
by
irs
but
by
the
sec
or
by
some
private
individual
in
a
securities
proceeding?
do
you
think
there
should
be
a
privilege
there?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
turn
on
if
it
were
sought
by
the
sec?
what
would
the
answer
turn
on
in
your
view,
the
terms
of
a
particular
statutory
provision
or
some
policy?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
the
outcome
be
different
if
it's
for
the
irs?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
papers
had
been
given
by
the
accountant
to
the
client
and
they
were
in
the
client's
possession
and
the
irs
sought
them?
should
there
be
a
privilege?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liggio,
i
don't
quite
understand
this
argument.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
corporation
that
is
being
audited
or
ultimately
may
be
audited
would
conceal
information
from
their
accounting
firm?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
auditors
wouldn't
probe
for
all
relevant
information?
unknown
speaker
the
level
of
candor
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
by
the
client.
unknown
speaker
if
you
audit
a
company's
books
regularly,
do
you
have
a
relationship
with
your
client
that
would
not
permit
that
sort
of
pressing
type
question?
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
so.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
didn't
have
information
that
you
were
satisfied
was
fully
adequate,
you'd
qualify
your
certificate,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
always
get
the
information
by
telling
the
client
you
won't
certify
the
audit
if
they
don't
give
you
the
information.
and
i
don't
think
the
problem
is
your
access
to
it;
it's
rather
what
you
don't
want
to
appear
in
the
file,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
liggio--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
the
client
asked
its
tax
lawyer
to
prepare
certain
information,
not
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
but
concerning
potential
tax
problems.
would
any
work
papers
of
the
lawyer
be
privileged
under
existing
law?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they're...
even
if
you
assume,
as
i
suggested,
that
they
were
not
prepared
in
anticipation
of
litigation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
if
we
should
decide
in
our
subjective
judgment
that
it
was
not
"fair"
to
do
that,
ought
we
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
in
our
past
cases
is
there
for
that
sort
of
a
thing,
to
just
evaluate
something
in
terms
of
"fairness"?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
taxpayer
had
done
his
own
work
and
prepared
work
papers
that
irs
sought?
would
they
be
somehow
protected?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
not
many
taxpayers
have
ever
thought
that
the
proceedings
with
irs
were
necessarily
fair,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
you
have
a
set
reserve.
i
don't
know
what
the
amount
might
be,
a
couple
hundred
thousand
dollars.
could
you
be
compelled
to
disclose
the
components
of
that,
how
much
of
that
is
for
the
particular
pending
claim
and
how
much
is
for
something
else?
do
you
think
that
you're
just
entitled
to
have
it
all
concealed
in
a
ballpark
figure?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
assuming
they're
not,
they're
not
flagged.
you've
got
three
separate
claims
in
litigation.
you
know
what
the
demand
is
in
each
claim.
could
you
be
compelled
to
say
with
respect...
and
then
there's
$200,000
set
aside.
could
you
be
compelled
to
say
that
100
is
for
claim
a,
50
for
claim
b,
and
50
for
claim
c?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
if
there's
only
one
claim
pending.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jackson,
you
referred
to
the
fundamental
fairness
argument.
but
isn't
the
entire
tax
system
established
on
the
theory
that
every
person
who
evades
or
avoids
a
tax,
particularly
evades
a
tax,
puts
a
burden
on
every
other
taxpayer,
and
doesn't
that
fundamental
fairness
have
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
taxpayers'
interests?
