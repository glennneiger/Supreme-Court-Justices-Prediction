unknown
speaker
you
mean
since
the
eigth
circuit
decision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
ask
you
a
fact
question.
do
most
of
the
members
of
the
tribe
live
in
the
land
that
is
under
consideration
here?
unknown
speaker
is
it
commingled
so
that
there
are
a
lot
of
non-indians
that
are
living
there
in
the
same
area?
unknown
speaker
kind
of
a
checkerboard?
unknown
speaker
is
the
seat
of
the
tribal
government
on
the
land?
unknown
speaker
he
was
kind
of
the
professional
negotiator
all
through
these
years,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
there
are
different
facts
are
there
not?
unknown
speaker
there
is
language
of
cession
and
agreement
in
rosebud.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
solicitor
general
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
now.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
rosebud
itself
affirmed
the
eigth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
were
prosecutions
regularly
being
conducted
in
the
federal
court
for
criminal
offenses
or
what?
unknown
speaker
ms.
locklear,
your
client
in
this
case
pleaded
guilty,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
not
waive
all
antecedent
jurisdictional
defects?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
was
correct?
unknown
speaker
have
the
tribal
police
been
exerting
jurisdiction
over
this
entire
open
area
since
the
act
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
hunting
and
fishing
rights
of
the
state
in
the
open
area?
unknown
speaker
see,
counsel,
a
long
time
ago
maybe
100
years
or
so
when
i
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
i
wrote
an
opinion
that
seems
to
carry
overtones
that
favor
the
other
side
of
the
case
from
yours.
that
i
think
was
united
states
ex
rel
minor.
the
attorney
general
throws
it
at
me,
but
i
do
not
believe
you
cite
it
in
your
brief.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
judge
lay
that
dissented.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
i
can
get
out
from
under
that--
unknown
speaker
--just
to
keep
clear
i
did
not
say
it
completely
supported
the
other
side.
i
said
it
had
overtones.
unknown
speaker
ms.
locklear,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
your
time
runs
out.
at
the
very
outset
of
your
argument
you
referred
to
a
letter
by
congressman...
later
head
of
the
indian
affairs...
burke
i
believe
it
was
about
the
location
of
the
indian
office
in
which
he
said
that
would
be
within
the
reservation,
something
to
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
where
that
is
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
has
the
federal
court
likewise
been
exercising
jurisdiction
and
has
the
tribal
court
also
been
exercising
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
i
thought
ms.
locklear
to
say
that
the
tribal
court
and
indeed
the
federal
court
had
also
exercised
jurisdiction
over
crimes
on
open
lands.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
