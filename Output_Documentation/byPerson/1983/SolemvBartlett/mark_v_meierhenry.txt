mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
another
eigth
circuit
case
and
the
procedural
history
is
basically
that
there
was
an
en
banc
hearing
in
1982
before
all
the
judges
of
the
eigth
circuit
asking
them
to
review
a
prior
decision
in
the
janis
case.
the
state
of
south
dakota
filed
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
that
decision
on
january
25,
1983.
this
court
granted
it
on
may
31.
i
should
advise
the
court
that
there
are
two
contrary
holdings
by
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
contrary
to
the
eigth
circuit's
decision
and
in
the
face
of
the
eigth
circuit's
decision
as
to
the
question
presented.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
not
the
last
eigth
circuit
decision,
the
en
banc.
we
requested
that
the
court
meet
once
again
on
this
issue
en
banc
to
reverse
a
prior
decision.
in
between
the
prior
decision
and
the
latest
affirmance
of
their
prior
decision
our
south
dakota
supreme
court
in
light
of
that
and
in
sometimes
colorful
language
has
disagreed
with
the
eigth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
basically
whether
the
opening
of
the
original
cheyenne
river
reservation
by
settlement
through
the
act
of
march
29,
1908
diminished
the
reservation,
the
original
reservation,
as
to
confer
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
opened
area
to
the
state
of
south
dakota.
the
facts
underlying
this
case
are
relatively
brief
and
simple.
they
are
that
mr.
bartlett
pleaded
guilty
to
attempted
rape
on
the
21st
of
april,
1979.
the
crime
that
he
pleaded
guilty
to
took
place
in
eagle
butte,
south
dakota.
eagle
butte,
south
dakota,
the
state
contends
is
outside
or
within
the
diminished
area...
i
should
say
outside
the
reservation
in
that
area
that
was
diminished
by
the
act
of
1908.
the
property
description
down
to
the
lot
and
block
is
lot
12,
block
16
which
is
required
because
it
is
not
reserved
land.
on
the
9th
of
february,
1982
mr.
bartlett
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
contesting
his
conviction.
i
think
it
is
best
to
approach
this
case--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--many
of
them
do
for
a
number
of
historical
reasons
perhaps
most
recently
was
the
building
of
the
dams
along
the
missouri
river,
the
flooding
of
certain
areas
which
caused
people
to
move
to
eagle
butte.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
is
a
checkerboarded
area.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
seat
of
tribal
government
is
at
eagle
butte,
south
dakota
which
is
off
the
reservation,
and
this
was
done
for
again
a
number
of
factual
reasons,
it
being
that
area
of
the
country
where
it
was
the
only
town
of
any
relative
size
having
a
communications
center
and
so
forth.
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
federal
government
chose
eagle
butte
and,
of
course,
once
the
federal
government
chooses
it
usually
the
tribal
government
follows
as
a
center.
if
the
court
would
indulge
me
for
a
moment
i
would
ask
for
a
moment
of
historical
whimsy.
assume
for
the
moment
that
instead
of
being
here
today
and
we
are
across
the
street
in
december
1908,
and
senator
gamble
of
south
dakota
has
once
again
offered
a
bill
to
diminish
reservations
in
south
dakota.
were
i
a
counsel
for
that
committee
i
might
remind
the
committee
as
follows:
that
in
1904
this
committee
diminished
gregory
county
which
is
found
on
map
4
of
the
handout;
that
in
1906
senator
gamble
once
again
introduced
a
bill
to
diminish
trip
county,
south
dakota
and
the
facts
there
this
committee
sent
out
to
south
dakota
colonel
mclaughlin
to
consult
with
the
indians.
the
committee
would
have
probably
been
reminded
that
this
court
in
lone
wolf
v.
hitchcock
had
held
that
congress
need
no
longer
have
agreement
but
could
unilaterally
diminish
a
reservation.
with
that
in
mind
that
is
what
we
did
in
gregory
county
which
is
found
on
map
4.
the
committee
probably
would
have
been
reminded
that
the
bill
being
introduced
and
as
usual
the
committee
asking
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
for
their
advice
and
as
usual
senator
mclaughlin
was
sent
to
consult
with
the
indians,
that
this
court
diminished
gregory
county
and
in
march
of
1907
passed
a
bill
which
diminished
trip
county.
it
is
now
in
december
of
1907.
the
act
concerning
standing
rock
and
cheyenne
river
reservation
was
introduced,
and
again
if
you
will
remember
that
we
sent
colonel
mclaughlin
to
consult
with
the
standing
rock
indians
and
the
indians
of
the
cheyenne
river
reservation
that
you
will
recall
senator
mclaughlin
took
a
blue
pencil
in
those
consultations
and
drew
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
he
informed
the
indians
that
they
would
have
two
separate
diminished
reservations,
and
we
passed
a
bill
to
that
effect.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
was
the
agent
for
the
united
states
government
and
as
the
map
will
show
he
was
the
person
who
went
out
and
consulted
with
the
indians
in
gregory
and
trip
county
which
this
court
has
held
diminished
in
our
case
here
today
and
eventually
in
bennett
and
millet
counties
which
came
later.
the
historical
whimsy
that
i
am
attempting
to
weave
so
to
speak
is
to
show
basically
that
the
committee,
senate
committee
on
indian
affairs,
that
discussed
these
bills
was
used
to
this
type
of
operation,
the
1908
bill
before
you
today,
in
1904,
1907,
the
case
in
question
we
have,
1908,
was
a
continuous
process.
of
course,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
dakota
and
rosebud
it
is
what
congress
intended
to
do
by
its
act,
and
in
order
to
find
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances
for
one
thing.
we
have
to
look
at
the
face
of
the
act
which
i
submit
to
the
court
today
is
clear
in
light
of
your
rosebud
decision.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
this
1908
case?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
rosebud
i
believe
this
court
made
the
transition
that
is
important.
the
court
said
that
the
1904
gregory
county
act
did
have
these
words
of
cession,
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
trip
county
act
which
is
found
on
map
4
and
the
act
here
today
the
operative
words
are
04
act
concerning
gregory
county
and
the
07
act
which
had
the
same
exact
language
as
we
have
in
the
08
act
was
the
functional
twin,
that
the
recognition
of
lone
wolf
and
the
unilateral
action
came
into
play.
so
in
looking
at
the
acts
that
have
already
been
decided
that
affect
south
dakota,
that
act
of
04,
07,
and
the
two
in
1910
we
have
the
same
operative
language
in
four
of
them,
"sell
and
dispose
of
a
portion
of
the
reservation.
"
one
of
the
bills
says
"sell
and
dispose
of
a
portion
of
the
pine
ridge
reservation.
"
one
says
cheyenne
river.
one
says
eagle
butte.
one
says
rosebud.
so
that
is
a
similar
factor.
also
the
school
lands
issue
is
a
functional
twin
of
these
cases.
south
dakota
being
a
state
that
came
in
in
1889
got
section
16
and
section
36
as
school
lands,
and
when
a
reservation
was
diminished
the
indian
tribe
had
to
be
paid
for
this
land
because
the
agreement
between
the
state
of
south
dakota
and
the
federal
government
was
they
were
to
get
these
two
school
land
sections.
most
of
the
debate
on
this
bill
of
1908
concerned
the
payment...
or
much
of
it
i
should
say...
concerned
the
payment
by
the
federal
treasury
to
the
state
for
these
school
lands.
that
is
similar.
the
other
thing
that
is
of
utmost
importance
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
rosebud
is
that
the
federal
government
had
no
duty
to
pay
the
state
until
such
time
as
the
reservation
is
extinguished,
and
once
it
is
extinguished
then
there
is
a
requirement
to
be
paid.
they
felt
in
all
of
these
acts
that
were
going
through
this
committee
at
that
time
that
they
had
a
duty
to
pay
south
dakota
because
their
intent
was
to
disestablish
the
reservation
and
extinguish
it
thereby
causing
there
to
be
a
payment.
the
usual
language
also
had
to
do
with
what
i
will
term
the
exchange
provision,
that
being
that
since
the
indian
country
was
being
reduced
those
indian
people
who
had
allotments
in
the
area
that
was
to
be
diminished
had
the
right
and
should
be
consulted
of
whether
they
wished
to
move
back
onto
the
closed
portion
of
the
reservation.
the
face
of
the
act
is
clear
on
that
portion,
and
the
intent
of
congress
because
in
referring
to
this
right
to
move
back
it
states
that
they
may
take
an
allotment
anywhere
within
the
respective
reservations
thus
diminished
to
which
the
reservation
may
belong.
so
on
the
face
of
the
act
especially
in
light
of
rosebud
we
have
the
same
operative
language
that
this
court
has
passed
upon
in
three
other
acts,
to
sell
and
dispose.
also
the
school
lands
provision
is
found
that
this
court
has
disposed
of
in
three
other
cases.
the
taking
of
allotments
has
been
decided
in
two
other
acts.
now
one
thing
that
is
also
important
and
the
committee
would
have
been
told
it
was
different
would
be
this.
on
the
face
of
this
act
of
1908
there
is
a
provision
that
states...
it
is
a
practical
provision
that
leaps
into
legislation
whether
it
is
at
the
state
level
or
the
federal
level.
there
must
have
been
a
request
by
the
indian
tribe
that
they
be
allowed
to
cut
timber
until
the
land
was
settled
until
a
settler
came
and
actually
was
on
the
land.
that
is
found
on
the
face
of
the
act.
congress
said
by
using
this
language
that
they
may
cut
this
timber
in
a
certain
area
only
as
long
as
the
lands
remain
part
of
the
public
domain,
and
this
public
domain
language
was
found
significant
in
the
seymour
case
which
we
believe
supports
the
state's
position
that
the
reservation
was
diminished.
so
just
as
this
court
said
that
the
1904
gregory
county
act
was
a
functional
twin...
or
the
1907
trip
county
act
was
a
functional
twin
to
the
04
act
we
believe
that
this
act
is
a
functional
twin
to
the
trip
county
act
and
should
be
treated
by
this
court
in
the
same
way
because
those
that
are
familiar
as
this
court
is
with
the
legislative
process...
we
had
a
whole
string
as
we
pointed
out
in
these
maps
of
cases
from
south
dakota
all
introduced
by
senator
gamble
of
south
dakota.
in
each
and
every
case
the
correspondent
between
the
city
of
washington
and
the
state
of
south
dakota
was
mclaughlin.
in
each
case
they
appended
to
the
senate
committee
his
report
of
what
occurred,
and
that
is
in
the
record,
of
course,
here.
here
he
makes
very
clear
that
he
took
a
blue
pencil
and
as
it
is
pointed
out
on
map
5
he
took
a
blue
pencil
and
he
explained
to
the
people
out
there
because
they
knew
after
lone
wolf
he
no
longer
had
to
have
an
agreement.
they
told
him
to
consult,
and
he
took
that
blue
pencil
and
he
showed
the
indian
people
out
there
where
there
reservation
would
be.
he
told
them
that
this
may
be
the
best
you
can
do
to
save
the
red
area
because
there
are
right
now
people
who
want
to
take
away
the
whole
thing.
there
was
not
an
agreement
because
there
did
not
need
to
be
an
agreement,
and
congress
knew
there
did
not
need
to
be
an
agreement.
it
was
a
consultation
as
to
what
would
occur.
that
is
exactly
what
happened
on
the
next
two
when
bennett
county
and
other
counties
were
diminished.
so
from
the
legislative
process
we
can
see
what
the
legislative
intent
was,
and
this
court
has
found
that
legislative
intent
on
either
side.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
mention
because
there
is
much
made
in
respondent's
brief
is
what
has
been
the
treatment
of
this
area.
as
this
court
said
in
rosebud
perhaps
the
single
most
salient
fact
is
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
shortly
thereafter.
south
dakota
had
exercised
jurisdiction
over
this
area
clearly
from
1911
until
the
eigth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
1972.
since
that
time
there
has
been
controversy.
we
have
had
two
district
judges
rule
one
way.
we
have
had
the
eigth
circuit
say
that
it
is
indian
country.
we
have
had
the
state
supreme
court
say
it
is
not
indian
country.
it
needs
to
be
settled.
but
at
least
from
1911
when
the
first
recorded
federal
case
appears,
the
laplant
case,
from
1911
to
1972
the
state
of
south
dakota
exercised
continuous
control
over
that
area.
it
was
considered
by
all
parties
to
be
within
the
state.
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
district
of
south
dakota
in
1973
in
the
case
that
was
before
the
eigth
circuit
filed...
i
believe
it
is
one
of
the
amicus
briefs...
a
clear
indication
that
at
least
in
1973
the
united
states
of
america
considered
this
to
be
a
diminished
reservation
and
not
a
park.
the
most
clear
way
that
i
can
state
it
is
by
quoting
a
brief
sentence
out
of
the
stankey
v.
waddell
case
of
our
supreme
court,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
wherein
they
said,
"this
court
assumed
jurisdiction
over
unalloted
land
within
the
opened
area
after
laplant
in
1911
and
consistently
maintained
such
jurisdiction
until
condon.
"
--that
being
the
eigth
circuit
case...
1972>
["].
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
has
filed
a
brief.
that
is
correct.
i
believe
the
united
states
government
as
it
can
do
can
change
its
mind.
however,
in
light
of
rosebud
we
think
the
law
should
be
consistent.
it
should
be
clear.
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
any
change
of
congressional
intent
between
the
spring
of
1908
and
the
fall
of
1908
or
the
year
1907.
so
for
all
of
those
reasons
the
state
of
south
dakota
would
urge
this
court
that
nothing
would
appear
in
the
legislative
history,
the
surrounding
circumstances
to
indicate
any
other
intent
of
congress
no
matter
the
rightness
of
its
cause
or
all
the
policy
arguments
of
today
that
anything
occurred
that
would
not
make
this
a
diminished
reservation.
we
would
ask
after
61
years
the
eigth
circuit
reversed
that
we
go
back
to
the
clear
understanding
of
all
in
south
dakota
and
the
clear
intent
of
congress
in
1908
in
diminishing
the
reservation
and
leaving
it
to
state
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
just
briefly,
your
honor.
counsel
in
here
zeal
perhaps
made
the
statement
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
by
making
the
statement
that
we
have
exercised
jurisdiction
since
1911
i
believe
her
words
said
it
is
just
not
true.
well,
in
that
regard
i
will
refer
the
court
to
612
federal
reporter
where
the
eigth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
as
follows:
basically
that
we
have
exercised
jurisdiction.
my
goodness,
why
would
we
have
had
hearings
in
all
these
cases
had
we
not
been
exercising
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
in
any
checkerboard
jurisdiction
of
course
this
occurs
because
with
the
reservation
being
diminished
if
it
occurs
on
an
indian
allotment
and
it
is
a
felony
the
united
states
of
america
takes
it
before
the
grand
jury
processes.
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
the
tribal
court
has
jurisdiction.
that
is
what
my
counsel
opponent
is
talking
about.
yes,
the
tribe
has
exercised
jurisdiction
on
the
indian
allotment
land,
the
checkerboarding
that
the
state
has
never
claimed
we
have
jurisdiction
on.
the
dotted
line
if
i
can
use
it
as
that
of
the
diminished
reservation
leaves
the
checkerboarding
which
we
have
handled
in
south
dakota
and
other
states--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--she
may
have
stated
that.
what
i
am
referring
to
in
612
federal
reporter
is
that
is
not
the
case.
the
united
states
attorney
for
south
dakota
testified
under
oath...
and
he
was
a
u.s.
attorney
for
29
years
from
1940
to
1969...
that
the
state
had
exercised
jurisdiction
and
also
the
state's
attorney
for
dewey
county,
the
area
considered
the
state
had
exercised.
i
did
not
think
today
that
there
would
be
a
statement
that
it
is
not
true
that
the
state
has
exercised
jurisdiction
for
61
years.
the
record
is
it
clearly
has.
so
what
i
am
stating
is
the
federal
government
and
i
as
a
defense
lawyer
when
i
started
practicing
had
cases
indian
defendant,
indian
victim
in
this
area
in
state
court.
there
is
a
1925
appellate
case.
so
that
is
the
only
reason
i
have
risen
in
rebuttal
is
to
point
out
that
that
is
not
an
issue.
we
have
to
remember
that
even
if
it
is
diminished
we
have
this
tri-party
level
of
state,
federal,
tribal
on
allotted
lands
which
are
miniature
reservations.
we
do
not
intend
nor
do
we
assert
jurisdiction
over
trust
land
off
the
reservation
any
more
than
i
assume
california
exercises
jurisdiction
over
the
persidia
which
is
a
federal
reservation.
thank
you.
