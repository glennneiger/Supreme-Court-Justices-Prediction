justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
one
is
solem
against
bartlett,
82-1253.
this
case
is
before
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
act
of
congress
passed
in
1908
diminished
the
boundaries
of
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
reservation,
which
is
located
in
north
and
south
dakota.
in
two
recent
opinions,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
the
1908
act
did
diminish
the
reservation.
however,
in
this
case,
the
eighth
circuit
ruled
that
the
act
did
not
alter
reservation
boundaries.
we
grant
the
certiorari
to
resolve
this
conflict.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
as
we
upheld
in
the
past,
an
act
of
congress
or
the
circumstances
of
the
act's
passage
must
clearly
demonstrate
a
congressional
purpose
to
reduce
the
size
of
an
indian
reservation
before
we
will
find
that
the
legislation
diminished
indian
lands.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
clear
demonstration,
we
assumed
that
congress
could
not
intend
to
change
reservation
boundaries.
the
act
of
may
29,
1908
does
not
unambiguously
demonstrate
the
congressman
to
diminish
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
reservation
nor
do
the
events
surrounding
the
passage
of
the
1908
act.
we
therefore
agree
with
the
eighth
circuit
that
the
1908
act
did
not
diminish
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
reservation
and
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
affirmed.
