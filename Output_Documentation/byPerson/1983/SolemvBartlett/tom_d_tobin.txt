mr.
tom
d.
tobin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
decided
four
cases
since
1962
that
deal
generally
with
the
question
presented,
seymour,
mattz,
decoteau
and
rosebud.
in
terms
of
the
central
issue
of
congressional
intent
we
have
an
act
of
congress
that
on
its
face
is
to
sell
and
dispose
of
a
portion
of
an
indian
reservation
leaving
a
reservation
thus
diminished
and
triggering
provisions
in
the
enabling
act
that
talked
in
terms
of
reservation
extinguishment
and
a
restoration
to
the
public
domain
which
also
appears
on
the
fact
of
the
act.
in
the
consultations
between
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government
references
were
made
to
new
reservation
boundaries
and
the
transaction
was
generally
referred
to
as
a
cession
or
sale
of
land
or
a
relinquishment
of
a
portion
of
a
reservation
as
similar
transactions
were
referred
to
and
similar
negotiations
for
decades
passed.
we
submit
that
common
sense
understanding
would
lead
one
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
to
alter
that
reservation,
and
from
1911
until
1973
the
decisions
of
our
courts
have
reflected
that
common
sense
understanding.
now
in
terms
of
county
government
we
did
have
a
serious
problem
when
the
court
of
appeals
altered
the
status
quo
and
disregarded
this
precedent
in
1973.
chief
justice
dunn
described
the
jurisdictional
confusion
that
resulted,
and
in
terms
of
the
units
of
local
government
most
directly
affected
by
a
decision
such
as
that
difficulty
was
experienced
in
the
area
in
terms
of
administering
law
and
order
and
performing
other
ordinary
county
functions.
in
general
i
think
the
amicus
briefs
from
other
counties
and
other
parts
of
the
country
attest
that
they
have
experienced
similar
problems
in
recent
years.
we
feel
that
essentially
this
particular
act,
the
1908
act,
fits
squarely
within
the
historical
perspective
of
the
decoteau
and
rosebud
precedent
of
this
court
from
two
perspectives.
number
one,
those
cases
should
establish
a
perspective
from
the
late
1800's
through
the
1900's
with
respect
to
the
general
allotment
act,
specifically
section
5.
secondly,
decoteau
and
rosebud
also
should
establish
a
perspective
that
although
there
were
changes
in
that
period
in
time
that
those
changes
were
not
intended
to
reflect
a
change
in
the
intent
of
congress.
i
think
to
put
the
second
point
in
another
way
one
cannot
expect
an
act
in
1894
to
be
drafted
in
the
same
manner
to
reflect
circumstances
that
did
not
exist
in
1908.
yet,
that
is
essentially
the
position
that
the
tribe
has
taken
in
this
particular
case
that
you
must
look
to
the
1984
rosebud
act
and
never
go
beyond
it
to
1907
and
1910.
yet
we
are
talking
about
a
1908
act
of
congress
that
is
in
all
substantial
respects
identical
to
the
two
later
rosebud
acts.
secondly,
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
decoteau
or
rosebud
documents
or
the
opinions
of
this
court
to
reflect
that
those
decisions
were
intended
to
be
anything
other
than
to
reflect
a
national
policy,
and
the
attorney
general's
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
minnesota
reflects
that
concern
and
11
other
states
have
joined
with
minnesota
in
those
views
by
lodging
letters
with
the
court.
at
the
very
least
decoteau
and
rosebud
represent
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
for
south
dakota,
and
the
confusion
in
this
particular
case
started
with
the
pre-rosebud,
pre-decoteau
precedent
of
condon
v.
erickson
in
1973.
now
we
feel
that
now
is
the
time
and
this
is
the
case
to
make
clear
that
such
pre-decoteau,
pre-rosebud
precedent
can
no
longer
be
blindly
adhered
to.
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
condon
it
did
so
with
express
references
to
stressing
the
need
to
find
a
reservation
boundaries
on
the
face
of
the
act
under
what
it
termed
the
glare
of
seymour.
this
court
in
decoteau
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
for
such
strict
construction
of
statutory
principles.
subsequent
to
rosebud
the
court
did
review
the
case
again,
but
the
limit
to
the
analysis
and
the
two
opinions
that
they
did
does
not
reveal
that
they
have
actually
adopted
the
approach
of
this
court
in
decoteau.
mr.
tom
d.
tobin
that
is
correct.
rosebud
did
affirm
the
eigth
circuit,
but
at
the
time
the
eigth
circuit
decided
rosebud
it
was
subsequent
to
having
been
earlier
reversed
in
decoteau.
secondly,
there
was
no
pre-decoteau,
pre-rosebud
precedent
such
as
condon
present
in
the
rosebud
case
which
we
feel
froze
the
eigth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1973
to
the
position
that
they
were
going
to
take
in
the
condon
decision.
this
court
in
puyallup
indicated
that
decoteau
and
rosebud
shed
new
light
upon
this
issue
in
general.
the
two
lower
district
court
decisions
that
by
the
federal
district
courts
that
came
out
subsequent
to
these
decisions
adopted
the
manner
and
the
approach
of
this
court's
opinions
in
rosebud
and
decoteau
and
documented
them
to
be
the
same.
now
we
feel
that
this
documentation
and
that
is
the
central
issue
here
should
have
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
same
conclusion.
in
conclusion
we
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
the
holdings
and
the
reasonings
of
decoteau
and
decide
this
case
in
the
context
of
those
opinions.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
closing
that
the
location
of
the
tribal
agency
in
this
particular
case
was
selected
in
1955
when
under
state
and
local
precedent
and
federal
precedent
it
was
acknowledged
to
be
off
the
reservation
and
that
the
population
statistics
presented
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
similarly
reflect
that
move.
the
missouri
river
was
flooded
in
the
'50's
and
the
people
moved
to
the
eagle
butte
area
because
tribal
trust
land
lied
adjacent
to
that
particular
town,
and
over
the
past
20
years
2000
more
people
now
reside
in
that
area.
the
town
itself
still
consists
of
approximately
400
and
some
people
within
the
reservation
boundaries,
and
through
the
1950's
the
statistics
in
that
particular
county
are
not
unlike
those
in
trip
county
and
millet
county
or
any
other
area
of
the
state
of
south
dakota.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions
i
will
sit
down.
thank
you.
