ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
think
it
is
crucial
for
this
court's
inquiry
in
this
case
to
examine
three
points,
three
statements,
and
in
some
cases
serious
misstatements
that
have
been
made
by
mr.
meierhenry
in
his
presentation
for
the
state.
first
of
all,
let's
look
at
the
demographics
of
this
area.
the
open
portion
of
the
cheyenne
river
reservation
now
has
65
percent
almost
66
percent
of
the
enrolled
members
of
the
cheyenne
river
tribe
now
residing
there.
overall
the
total
population
of
the
open
area
is
roughly
one-half
indian.
now
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
in
fact
or
in
the
record
for
the
petitioner's
suggestion
here
that
those
statistics
are
a
result
of
a
current
demographic
move
on
the
part
of
the
cheyenne
river
people
as
a
result
of
flooding
on
the
western
part
of
the
reservation.
i
refer
the
court
to
professor
hoxie's
conclusion
which
is
a
part
of
this
record
that
at
the
time
the
proclamation
was
issued
which
opened
this
area
in
1909
55
percent
of
the
tribal
allottees
were
located
in
the
opened
area,
and
the
opened
area
which
is
now
the
subject
of
this
law
suit.
that
is
a
significant
figure
because
one
of
the
variations
of
the
allotment
act
and
the
opening
act
of
cheyenne
river
over
the
general
allotment
scheme
was
that
each
member
of
the
tribe
was
to
receive
their
own
allotment
so
that
when
55
percent
of
tribal
allotments
were
located
in
the
opened
area
that
is
a
good
indication
of
what
the
population
of
the
area
was
at
the
time
as
well.
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
congressman
from
south
dakota
who
was
responsible
for
the
support
and
sponsoring
and
enactment
of
the
rosebad
acts
which
the
petitioners
find
so
persuasive
here
was
also
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
the
early
1920's.
in
that
capacity
congressman
burke
wrote,
and
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
excerpts
from
this
letter,
that
he
agreed
that
the
recommendation
made
originally
in
1912
that
the
bia
offices
which
now
service
the
tribe
should
be
moved
to
eagle
butte,
should
be
done,
that
that
move
should
be
implemented.
this
correspondence
takes
place
some
time
in
the
early
1920's
which
indicates
and
the
letter
says
explicitly
that
eagle
butte
is
in
the
center
of
the
reservation.
now
that
is
the
view
mind
you
of
congressman
burke
who
later
sponsored
and
was
responsible
for
the
enactment
of
the
very
1907
and
1910
rosebud
acts
which
the
state
finds
so
persuasive
here.
that
we
think
is
a
strong
indication
that
congressman
burke
unlike
the
state
now
knows
the
difference
between
the
1907
and
1910
rosebud
acts
and
this
very
situation.
now
the
second
inquiry
we
need
to
examine
are
those
statutes.
let's
look
at
the
similarities
in
the
language
between
the
1907,
the
1910
rosebud
statutes
and
this
statute.
let's
take
mr.
meierhenry's
hypothetical
committee
one
year
back
further.
he
suggested
that
as
a
committee
they
might
have
examined
in
1907
its
precedent
in
rosebud
and
referred
to
that
in
adopting
the
1908
cheyenne
river
statute.
that
very
same
hypothetical
committee
would
have
had
before
it
one
year
before
in
1906
consideration
of
an
act
with
precisely
the
same
operative
language
which
applied
to
the
coleville
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington.
this
court
had
occasion
to
construe
that
language
in
seymore
v.
superintendent
and
did
not
find
that
language
the
language
authorizing
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
sell
and
dispose
of
surplus
and
unalloted
lands
to
have
the
purpose
of
disestablishment.
obviously
the
language
itself
does
no
prove
the
clear
intent
on
congress'
part
which
is
required
to
find
an
act
of
disestablishment.
we
must
look
elsewhere
in
rosebud.
in
rosebud
that
other
evidence
is
found
before
the
1907
statute.
it
is
found
in
he
1904
act
and
it
is
found
in
the
1901
and
1903
agreements,
cession
agreements,
using
typical
cession
language
between
the
rosebud
tribe
and
the
united
states.
those
two
agreements
were
explicitly
set
out
in
their
very
terms
in
the
1904
statute,
and
this
court
in
its
analysis
of
the
three
rosebud
acts
explicitly
said
as
well
that
the
language
and
the
circumstances
of
the
1904
statute
were
crucial
to
its
inquiry
in
that
case.
the
preexisting
disestablishment
language
agreements
and
the
codification
of
that
purpose
in
the
1904
act
establish
a
base
line
purpose
and
a
continuing
purpose
of
disestablishment
which
was
simply
carried
forward
in
the
later
1907
and
1910
acts.
the
fact
then
that
the
1907
and
1910
acts
used
language
different
from
the
1904
act
was
really
viewed
as
fairly
insignificant
by
this
court
in
its
rosebud
decision.
its
analysis
centered
primarily
on
the
1904
act
and
its
adoption
and
explicit
ratification
of
the
1901
and
1903
agreements
having
disestablishment
language.
because
we
do
not
have
that
base
line
purpose
of
disestablishment
in
a
preexisting
cession
agreement
in
this
case
the
sell
and
dispose
language
which
we
find
in
1908
could
have
easily
have
been
presumed
by
mr.
meierhenry's
hypothetical
committee
to
mean
the
same
thing
that
that
committee
thought
it
meant
in
1906
and
which
is
what
this
court
construed
it
to
mean
later
in
its
seymour
v.
superintendent
decision.
that
is
a
purpose
to
open
the
lands
only
but
not
to
alter
the
reservation
boundaries.
a
third
point
that
is
significant
and
where
we
take
sharp
difference
with
the
state
on
is
the
so-called
history
of
uncontested
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
over
the
opened
area.
now
let's
examine
that.
the
state
asserts
without
any
reference
to
any
authority
because
there
is
none
that
it
has
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
opened
areas
for
60
years
without
contest
by
the
tribe
and
the
federal
government.
that
is
simply
not
true.
the
most
salient
evidence
of
the
untruthfulness
of
that
fact
is
that
there
is
no
a
single
state
prosecution
of
an
indian
in
state
court
before
the
early
1960's.
1963
is
the
first
recorded
state
prosecution
of
an
indian
of
a
crime
alleged
having
occurred
on
the
opened
portion
of
the
cheyenne
river
reservation.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
the
record
that
we
have
in
this
cases
suggests
that
they
were,
your
honor.
if
you
refer
to
our
brief
we
cite
two
instances
where
the
federal
court
did
prosecute
members
of
the
tribe
for
crimes
that
occurred
on
the
opened
portion
of
the
reservation
after
1908.
the
state
has
simply
chosen
to
ignore
at
least
that
evidence
of
belief
on
the
part
of
the
federal
court
that
it
did
indeed
have
jurisdiction.
it
reflects
a
brief
on
the
part
of
not
only
the
prosecutor
but
the
court
that
the
federal
court
at
the
time
had
jurisdiction
over
the
area.
the
only
two
cases
that
the
state
does
cite
are
prosecutions
of
a
non-indian,
and
this
court
is
well
aware
that
when
there
is
a
competing
claim
of
authority
or
jurisdiction
in
indian
country
between
the
tribe,
the
state
and
the
federal
government
that
where
non-indians
are
involved
the
state's
interest
is
always
given
greater
weight.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
the
plea
was
entered
and
at
the
time
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
filed
our
client
was
unrepresented
by
counsel.
it
was
not
until
the
case
with
the
eigth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
bartlett.
it
is
not
at
all
clear
how
and
under
what
circumstances
plea
bargaining
was
arranged
so
i
cannot
speak
factually
to
the
issue
of
waiver,
but
i
would
point
out
as
well
that
jurisdictional
defects
have
traditionally
been
viewed
as
nonwaivable
by
the
courts.
i
think
that
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
a
disabling
defect
in
the
state
court
jurisdiction
which
could
not
be
waived
under
any
circumstances.
now
once
those
three
points
are
examined
you
get
some
idea
of
what
the
state's
case
is
like
here.
the
state's
case
is
built
on
assertions
for
which
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
them
in
the
record
and
built
on
mischaracterizations
of
exactly
what
happened
in
the
instance
of
the
1908
statute
on
cheyenne
river.
with
he
remainder
of
my
time
i
would
like
to
divide
my
comments
between
the
two
general
principles
which
we
think
most
clearly
demonstrate
that
aside
from
these
mischaracterizations
the
1908
act
itself
did
not
have
the
purpose
of
disestablishing
the
opened
area
of
the
cheyenne
river
reservation.
first,
the
federal
indian
policy
which
prevailed
at
the
time
in
1908
was
based
on
the
general
allotment
act
also
known
as
the
dawes
act
of
1887.
this
court
construed
that
statute
in
its
decision
in
1973
in
mattz
v.
arnett.
as
explained
by
this
court
the
dawes
act
simply
provided
for
the
division
of
tribal
lands
among
tribal
members
as
an
allotment
and
the
sale
of
surplus
or
leftover
tribal
lands
to
non-indian
homesteaders.
it
was
thought
at
the
time
this
court
explained
that
by
dividing
tribal
property
in
that
manner
the
congress
could
encourage
tribal
indians
to
abandon
tribal
ways
and
adopt
white
ways.
it
was
thought
that
eventually
that
process
would
lead
to
the
natural
demise
of
all
indian
reservations,
but
significantly
this
court
held
in
mattz
v.
arnett
that
the
general
allotment
act
itself
did
not
have
that
purpose.
the
general
allotment
act
did
not
provide
for
or
require
and
was
not
inconsistent
with
continued
reservation
status
of
all
indian
reservations.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
was
absolutely
correct,
and
we
think
that
that
theme
was
also
carried
forward
as
this
court
observed
in
mattz
v.
arnett
in
the
special
opening
acts.
the
dawes
act
itself
was
discretionary
and
did
not
compel
that
any
particular
indian
reservation
be
opened.
congress
from
time
to
time
as
a
result
passed
special
opening
acts
which
required
that
a
particular
reservation
be
opened
pursuant
to
that
general
policy
and
oftentimes
made
some
variations
for
that
general
policy
in
light
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
that
reservation.
in
its
mattz
opinion
the
court
construed
such
a
general
opening
act.
the
act
before
it
in
that
case
was
the
1892
klamath
river
act
which
applied
to
the
klamath
river
reservation
in
california.
it
also
had
the
same
language
that
the
hypothetical
committee
in
1906
had
before
it
in
the
coleville
statute,
that
is,
the
operative
language
directed
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
sell
and
dispose
of
surplus
unallotted
lands
on
the
reservation.
this
court
described
that
statute
as
simply
one
of
a
number
of
typical
opening
acts
which
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
the
dawes
act
and
did
not
have
the
effect
of
altering
the
reservation
boundaries
in
that
case.
this
court
in
the
mattz
opinion
in
construing
that
statute
also
referred
to
the
1908
cheyenne
river
act
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
footnote
19
of
its
opinion
the
court
after
having
described
the
clamoth
river
statute
as
but
typical
of
the
numerous
opening
statutes
of
the
period
listed
a
number
of
other
statutes.
that
list
included
among
others
the
1908
cheyenne
river
act.
the
court
also
noted
the
cheyenne
river
statute
had
been
construed
by
the
eigth
circuit
as
not
having
affected
reservation
boundaries.
this
court's
supposition
in
mattz
v.
arnett
that
the
1908
statute
did
not
have
the
effect
of
altering
the
reservation
boundaries
is
borne
out
by
a
closer
examination
of
the
terms
of
the
1908
statute
itself.
first
of
all,
the
statute
generally
did
not
more
than
what
the
dawes
act
authorized
generally
across
the
nation.
the
dawes
act
applied
as
i
noted
to
all
indian
reservations
and
had
been
applied
specifically
to
open
indian
reservations
in
states
as
varied
as
washington,
idaho,
montana,
north
dakota
and
others
including
south
dakota.
the
cheyenne
river
act
was
simply
a
specialized
application
of
that
general
dawes
act
policy.
it
provided
as
well
for
the
division
of
tribal
lands
among
tribal
members
and
non-indian
homesteaders.
significantly,
it
varied
the
general
dawes
act
scheme
in
some
particulars
that
we
should
note.
first
of
all,
it
provided
for
the
reservation
of
certain
tribal
property
interests
in
the
opened
area
itself.
sufficient
property
interest
for
indian
agency,
school
and
religious
purposes
were
explicitly
reserved
in
the
cheyenne
river
act.
in
addition,
the
act
also
reserved
all
mineral
lands
located
in
the
opened
area
that
were
to
be
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
the
act
did
not
in
its
terms
alter
the
reservation
boundaries.
the
act
in
its
terms
did
not
terminate
the
opened
area.
the
act
did
not
suggest
that
state
court
jurisdiction
would
be
extended
to
the
opened
area.
in
fact,
the
act
did
not
even
allude
to
state
court
jurisdiction
over
the
area.
also
importantly
given
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
taken
the
act
did
not
employ
the
cession
language
which
has
typically
been
found
by
this
court
to
support
a
finding
of
disestablishment.
the
primary
terms
of
the
1908
statute
then
show
nothing
more
than
the
typical
opening
act
which
this
court
construed
in
both
mattz
v.
arnett
and
seymour
v.
superintendent
as
having
left
the
reservation
boundaries
intact.
now
the
state
as
a
result
of
that
seizes
upon
language
which
appears
elsewhere
in
the
statute
and
tries
to
construct
in
effect
a
new
statute
based
on
phraseology
and
provisos
which
appear
in
later
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
first
of
those
that
the
state
refers
to
is
the
language
where
in
section
2
the
final
proviso
of
section
2
congress
contrasted
indian
allotments
retained
in
the
opened
portion
of
the
reservation
with
those
allotments
located
on
that
part
of
the
reservation
"thus
diminished".
that
is
the
language
that
the
state
lifts
out
of
the
closing
proviso
out
of
section
2
as
the
key
to
construing
the
entire
statute.
even
in
that
instance,
however,
the
state
is
simply
wrong.
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
we
have
that
congress
intended
by
the
use
of
that
term
to
mean
anything
other
than
reduced
or
diminished
common
tribal
land
ownership,
not
reduced
reservation
boundaries.
the
eigth
circuit
in
its
opinion
and
which
this
court
cited
favorably
in
mattz
v.
arnett
distinctly
noted
that
the
context
of
that
phrase
"thus
diminished"
suggests
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
phrase
meant
and
no
more.
in
addition,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
is
set
out
at
length
by
the
state
in
the
appendix
to
their
brief
indicates
that
the
congress
in
its
reports
on
the
1908
statute
used
that
phrase
"diminished"
to
refer
as
well
to
the
reduced
or
diminished
common
land
base
of
the
tribe,
not
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
subsequent
treatment
of
the
1908
statute
which
indicates
that
that
phrase
was
commonly
used
by
the
department
of
the
interior
in
its
records
after
the
passage
of
the
act
to
refer
to
precisely
that,
the
area
of
the
reservation
where
the
tribe
held
diminished
or
reduced
tribal
lands.
specifically
and
i
think
which
is
the
most
telling
example
comes
from
an
exhibit
which
appears
as
attached
to
professor
hoxie's
report.
it
is
an
excerpt
from
the
1911
annual
report
of
the
superintendent
of
the
cheyenne
river
indian
reservation,
1911,
after
the
passage
of
the
act.
referring
to
tribal
court
and
tribal
police
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
the
superintendent
says,
"the
police
are
expected
to
cover
the
entire
reservation
both
the
diminished
portion
and
the
portion
thrown
open
to
settlement.
"
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
yes,
indeed
they
have
since
before
the
passage
of
the
act.
the
history
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction
and
the
history
of
tribal
police
authority
over
the
reservation
long
precede
and
anti-dates
the
passage
of
the
1908
statute.
that
is
another
aspect
of
the
state's
so-called
long-term
reliance
of
jurisdiction
that
is
simply
inaccurate.
they
wholly
overlook
the
continued
assertion
of
tribal
authority
over
that
area.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
not
that
appear
on
this
record,
justice
o'connor.
the
only...
in
fact
this
record
this
record
suggests
that
the
only
interests
at
stake
in
this
case
are
interests
of
tribal
members.
if
you
will
refer
to
the
1937
codification
of
the
tribal
laws
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief
you
will
see
that
the
tribe
in
1937
codified
its
practice
of
asserting
jurisdiction
over
only
tribal
members.
that
is
explicitly
stated
in
its
1937
code.
that
appears
to
have
been
its
practice
before
1937.
professor
hoxie's
report
on
this
issue
is
clear,
and
i
might
add
unrefuted
by
the
state
that
both
the
tribal
court
and
the
tribal
police
exercise
authority
over
the
entire
area
after
1908.
it
becomes
clearer
if
you
understand
that
the
cheyenne
river
reservation
was
at
the
time
both
before
and
after
the
passage
of
the
act
divided
administratively
for
purposes
of
both
tribal
government
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
into
four
administrative
districts.
one
of
those
districts,
the
thunder
butte,
was
located
wholly
within
the
opened
portion
of
the
reservation.
professor
hoxie
notes,
and
again
this
stands
unrefuted
by
the
state,
that
the
subagency
at
thunder
butte
after
1908
had
an
operating
tribal
court
which
exercised
jurisdiction
in
criminal
matters
over
its
own
members
under
the
explicit
report
and
authority
of
the
department
of
the
interior.
we
think
that
that
record
which
again
was
carried
forward
and
codified
in
1937
which,
of
course,
was
approved
explicitly
by
the
department
of
the
interior
shows
a
strong
understanding
on
both
the
tribe
and
the
department
that
the
1908
act
did
not
have
the
effect
of
altering
the
reservation
boundaries.
as
a
result
the
thus
diminished
language
referred
to
and
relied
on
so
heavily
by
the
state
in
this
case
can
mean
no
more
than
what
this
court
quoted
in
its
mattz
v.
arnett
opinion
out
of
the
klamath
river
situation.
in
the
klamath
river
act
the
court
noted
that
the
statute
itself
referred
to
"was
the
klamath
river
indian
reservation.
"
now
because
that
phrase
in
that
statute
could
be
read
either
one
of
two
ways
this
court
concluded
that
that
phrase
could
not
support
a
finding
of
clear
intent
on
congress's
part
to
disestablish
the
reservation.
the
phrase
"thus
diminished"
in
this
context
must
be
similarly
construed.
it
as
well
cannot
support
a
finding
of
clear
intent
to
disestablish
the
cheyenne
river
reservation.
now
there
are
as
the
state
has
noted
surrounding
circumstances
that
must
also
be
examined
to
construe
any
particular
opening
statute.
in
this
instance
there
are
two
such
surrounding
circumstances
which
we
think
are
particularly
telling.
first,
is
the
absence
of
an
agreement,
a
cession
agreement,
with
the
cheyenne
river
sioux
tribe.
there
were
as
the
state
points
out
some
meetings
between
a
government
official
and
the
cheyenne
tribe
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
the
provisions
of
the
1908
statute.
there
was,
however,
no
meeting
held
or
no
negotiation
sponsored
with
the
governing
body
of
the
cheyenne
river
tribe.
no
agreement
was
proposed.
no
agreement
was
signed.
you
had
nothing
more
than
a
small
group
of
tribal
members
who
could
be
assembled
on
short
notice
attending
a
hurried
meeting
with
a
government
official
for
the
limited
purpose
of
explaining
the
act.
now
let's
pause
for
a
moment
here
and
examine
what
the
state
characterizes
as
the
nature
of
those
discussions.
the
state
would
have
us
believe
that
those
discussions
clearly
demonstrated
to
the
tribe
that
their
reservation
boundaries
would
be
diminished,
altered,
reduced.
that
is
not
the
case
at
all.
those
discussions
demonstrated
only
that
the
tribe's
common
land
base
would
be
diminished,
reduced.
first
of
all,
the
magic
blue
line
which
the
petitioners
find
so
important
as
to
that
construction
of
the
meeting
did
not
take
place
at
all
at
cheyenne
river.
the
blue
line
and
the
map
on
which
it
was
drawn
appeared
only
at
the
meeting
that
took
place
several
days
before
with
the
standing
rock
tribe.
howver,
even
if
you
examine
the
significance
of
that
blue
line
and
of
the
map
that
was
produced
at
that
meeting
you
will
see
that
they
do
not
again
even
in
that
context
support
the
construction
that
the
petitioners
would
have
this
court
reach.
we
must
understand
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
government
agent
explaining
in
the
lakota
language,
a
language
to
which
the
concept
of
a
lands
sale
is
wholly
alien...
you
have
a
government
explaining
in
that
language
the
provision
of
exactly
that,
a
land
sale.
now
to
illustrate
to
the
tribe
exactly
which
lands
were
going
to
be
sold,
which
lands
were
going
to
be
retained,
the
government
agent
took
out
a
map
and
he
drew
a
line
and
he
said
these
lands
will
be
yours
and
these
lands
will
be
open
to
settlement.
there
is
no
indication
that
the
government
agent
did
more
than
that,
that
the
government
agent
meant
more
than
that
or
that
the
standing
rock
or
the
cheyenne
river
people
in
attendance
understood
any
more
than
that.
viewed
in
that
context
the
reference
by
that
government
agent
to
diminished
land
means
the
same
thing
that
that
phrase
means
in
the
proviso
that
appears
in
section
2
of
the
act.
it
means
nothing
more
than
this
will
be
from
henceforth
your
reduced
land
base.
there
was
no
discussion
at
all
of
jurisdictional
consequences.
understood
in
that
context
the
blue
line,
the
map,
the
appearance
of
a
particular
government
agent
has
no
significance
at
all.
now
i
might
add
that
the
particular
government
agent
which
the
court
is
encouraged
to
find
persuasive
here
is
really
an
incidental
if
relevant
factor
at
all.
the
particular
government
agent
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
had
been
an
agent
for
some
number
of
years
and
had
traveled
in
that
capacity
to
a
number
of
indian
reservations
including
those
in
south
dakota.
that
same
agent
also
visited
the
coleville
reservation
in
washington
which
this
court
found
not
to
have
been
disestablished.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
congress
gave
this
particular
inspector
carte
blanche
to
carry
with
him
the
kiss
of
disestablishment
to
every
reservation
that
he
visited.
south
dakota
in
that
respect
is
not
unique
any
more
than
south
dakota
is
not
unique
in
respect
of
the
opening
language
or
with
respect
to
the
disestablishment
language.
those
factors
will
not
support
finding
of
disestablishment
here.
they
were
referred
to
again
by
this
court
in
rosebud,
but
only
up
against
the
context
of
the
clear
language
of
disestablishment
found
earlier
in
the
1904
statute.
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
eigth
circuit
has
considered
that
view,
reconsidered
the
view
in
light
of
the
dissent,
your
dissent
in
particular,
and
in
light
of
this
court's
later
opinions
on
this
very
issue
and
decided
to
adhere
to
its
original
position
that
the
cheyenne
river
reservation
was
not
disestablished
by
the
1908
act.
we
think--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true,
but
we
nonetheless
think
that
the
court's
majority
opinion
in
its
reconsideration
en
banc
of
that
issue
gives
your
honor
sufficient
grounds
to
find
that
the
1908
statute
is
different
and
is
not
governed
by
the
other
principles
that
the
petitioner--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
we
do.
we
would
encourage
you
to
try.
[laughter]
the
second
salient
and
we
think
compelling
factor
in
this
case
that--
ms.
arlinda
f.
locklear
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
the
second
circumstance
that
we
think
is
relevant
here
and
would
support
a
determination
by
this
court
that
the
opened
lands
have
not
been
disestablished
has
already
been
alluded
to,
and
that
is
the
consistent
and
unrefuted
assertion
of
tribal
authority
in
this
area
after
1908.
essentially
what
we
have
got
here
is
a
question
that
concerns
tribal
indians
themselves.
we
have
an
assertion
in
this
very
case
of
state
authority
to
prosecute
for
crimes
that
occurred
with
in
a
reservation
an
indian
where
the
complaining
witness
in
the
case
is
also
an
indian.
the
state's
interest
in
such
cases
has
been
acknowledged
by
this
court
to
be
minimal
admittedly.
if
we
succeed
in
this
litigation
then
the
state
will
lose
a
very
limited
part
of
its
jurisdiction
now.
it
will
lose
only
its
ability
to
prosecute
cases
such
as
these.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
lose
this
case
the
tribal
court
will
lose
the
authority
it
has
been
exercising
since
well
before
1908
and
the
authority
which
has
gone
unchallenged
by
the
state
until
the
early
1960's
to
exercise
its
own
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
