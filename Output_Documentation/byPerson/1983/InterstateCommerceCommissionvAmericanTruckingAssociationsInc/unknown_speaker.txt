unknown
speaker
under
that,
mr.
phillips,
was
the
usual
remedy
retroactive,
cancel
it
out
all
the
way?
unknown
speaker
you
just
said
that
they
exercise
their
discretion
under
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
cancel
the
filed
tariff.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
the
only
thing
the
commission
would
do?
unknown
speaker
such
as?
unknown
speaker
and
require
adjustments.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
it
cancel
it
out
only
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
could
it
also
revoke
approval
of
the
rate
bureau
agreement
itself?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if
the
issue
in
the
aberdeen
case
involving
the
symbolization
rule,
does
that
pertain
to
rate
bureau
or
is
that
entirely
separate?
unknown
speaker
is
the
failure
to
put
the
right
symbol
on
the
tariff
a
violation
of
a
rate
bureau
agreement?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
possible
to
decide
this
case
one
way
and
the
other
case
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
and
not
a
necessary
conflict.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
could
you
give
examples
of
significant
violations
that
would
be
subject
to
the
retroactive
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
commission
would
have
an
opportunity
when
the
rate
is
first
filed
to
disallow
it,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
rule
really
a
product
of
the
commission's
lack
of
funding
or
staffing
to
get
around
these
things
earlier?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
rejection
is
a
creature
of
statute
in
a
sense.
the
statute
talks
about
rejection,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
presumably
the
commission
is
bound
to
follow
whatever
constraints
may
be
contained
in
the
statutory
creation
of
rejection.
unknown
speaker
does
the
terminology
of
rejection,
though,
indicate
that
it
is
something
that
has
not
yet
gone
into
effect?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
suggestion
there
that
that
is
the
meaning?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
whole
structure
set
up
by
congress
suggest
that
when
there
is
an
interval
in
which
the
commission
can
accept
it
or
not
and
then
it
goes
into
effect
and
thereafter
there
are
other
procedures
whereby
the
commission
could
initiate
an
examination
for
the
future?
does
that
whole
structure
suggest
something
contrary
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
fact
that
subsection
(e)
is
part
of
that
one
section
which
generally
deals
with
processing
of
new
rates?
do
you
take
the
view
that
rejection
can
occur
at
any
time,
even
ten
years
later?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
reject
ten
years
later.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
what
if
congress
with
respect
to
rates
the
commission
may
do
the
following:
it
may
reject;
it
may
suspend;
it
may
be
hearing
and
find
unreasonable.
it
didn't
say
anything
more.
do
you
think
the
commission
given
those
three
weapons
to
deal
with
rates
filed
could
say,
well,
in
addition
we
are
going
to
have
three
or
four
other
kinds
of
procedures
that
are
a
little
bit
different
than
anything
like
the
three
that
congress
has
set
forth.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
you
one
more
thing,
mr.
phillips,
and
that
is
could
the
commission
reject
a
proposed
rate
within
the
time
provided
in
the
statute
simply
because
it
lacks
enough
information
on
the
proceedings
to
let
it
make
a
sound
decision?
unknown
speaker
so
why
does
it
need
this
rather
unusual
power
to
go
back
on
an
issue?
unknown
speaker
is
there
not
another
consideration
here?
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
filing
violates
the
rate
bureau
agreement
it
does
not
have
the
immunity
of
the
reed-bulwinkle
act.
am
i
correct
in
that?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
true
and
then
there
is
an
incorrect
tariff
filed
that
violates
the
agreement,
the
people
who
file
it
run
a
very
substantial
risk
of
treble
damage
liability,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
greater
deterrence
than
the
fear
of
rejection.
unknown
speaker
if
they
talk
to
a
venturesome
lawyer
they
would
not
have
much
trouble
getting
representation
i
would
not
think
in
a
case
like
this
because
it
is
a
clear
violation
if
there
is
no
immunity.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
feel
for
how
often
these
violations
occur?
i
take
it
it
only
applies
to--
unknown
speaker
--the
significant
ones
that
this
rule
contemplates.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
reed-bulwinkle
act
has
been
in
effect
for
a
lot
longer
than
that.
so
there
have
been
rate
bureau
agreements
for
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
i
had
a
little
feeling
in
reading
the
briefs
that
maybe
this
was
kind
of
a
theoretical
problem.
may
i
am
just
unsophisticated.
unknown
speaker
has
this
always
been
the
commission's
view?
unknown
speaker
the
position
that
you
are
furthering.
unknown
speaker
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mceligot,
mr.
phillips
stressed
reliance
on
american
trucking
for
the
position
that
he
took.
do
you
plan
to
mention
that?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
just
one
question?
does
it
require
any
kind
of
a
hearing
under
the
proposed
rule?
unknown
speaker
before
the
rejection
or
after?
unknown
speaker
after--
unknown
speaker
--no,
the
tariff
is
filed
and
goes
into
effect
and
then
they
think
they
found
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
do
they
have
to
have
some
kind
of
hearing
to
determine
there
was
a
violation
before
they
reject,
or
they
just
go
ahead
and
reject?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
