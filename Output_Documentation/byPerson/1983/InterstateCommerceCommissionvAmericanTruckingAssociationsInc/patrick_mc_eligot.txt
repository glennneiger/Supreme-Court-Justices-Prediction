mr.
patrick
mc
eligot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
first
like
to
address
some
questions
that
were
asked
of
counsel
where
we
have
a
difference
of
opinion.
first,
justice
stevens,
asked
whether
there
was
a
direct
conflict
between
this
case
and
the
aberdeen
case.
we
submit
that
there
is,
your
honor.
the
holding
here
is
the
commission
cannot
retroactively
validate
tariffs.
the
holding
in
aberdeen
is
that
it
can.
there
is
a
direct
conflict,
and
i
think
you
have
to
decide
both
of
these
cases
together.
justice
o'connor
asked
if
this
rule
was
the
result
of
the
problem
that
the
commission
is
complaining
about
about
not
having
enough
funds
to
check
tariffs
before
they
become
effective.
this
case
does
not
involve
that,
your
honor,
because
the
type
of
violations
we
are
dealing
with
here
would
not
be
discovered
by
the
tariff
examiners
who
look
at
the
tariffs
and
determine
whether
they
are
tariff
informality
violations.
they
do
not
look
at
substantive
violations
at
all.
this
is
not
involved.
the
aberdeen
case
does
involve
that
question.
you
also
asked,
justice
o'connor,
whether
the
commission
could
reject
a
tariff
when
it
lacks
sufficient
information.
no,
it
would
not
reject
the
tariff.
it
would
suspend
the
tariff
ending
an
investigation.
these
are
separate
powers.
the
tariff
rejection
power
is
simply
to
deal
with
tariff
filing
informalities,
procedural
matters.
if
the
tariff
is
not
filed
in
accordance
with
the
commission's
tariff
circular
rules,
it
would
reject
it.
if
there
is
a
substantive
violation
of
the
act
such
as
a
violation
of
the
rate
bureau
agreements,
it
would
suspend
the
tariff.
finally,
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
threat
of
antitrust
liability,
and
you
mentioned
treble
damage
liability.
i
would
just
like
to
mention
that
very
recently
the
justice
department
brought
a
case,
a
criminal
case,
against
some
of
the
clients
that
i
represent,
a
rate
bureau,
alleging
just
these
violations,
violations
of
rate
bureau
procedures.
that
case
was
dismissed
and
was
turned
into
a
civil
proceeding,
but
the
threat
is
even
more
serious
than
you
suggest.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
pointing
out
three
misconceptions
that
are
likely
to
arise
from
a
reading
of
the
icc's
decision
and
counsel's
briefs:
first,
that
the
rule
at
issue
interprets
and
implements
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980;
second,
that
the
tariff
rejection
procedures
satisfy
the
full
hearing
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act;
and
third,
that
the
icc
will
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
discretion
in
the
matter
of
refunds
to
shippers.
none
of
these
statements
are
correct
as
i
will
show.
while
the
icc's
decision
states
that
it
is
intended
to
interpret
and
implement
provisions
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980,
there
is
nothing
in
that
act
even
addressing
this
subject.
the
commission
admitted
in
its
decision
that
it
was
concerned
that
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980
congress
did
not
go
far
enough
in
providing
remedies
for
violations
of
rate
bureau.
it,
therefore,
took
it
upon
itself
to
provide
this
additional
remedy,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
now,
this
is
important
because
of
what
the
congress
said
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980.
i
would
like
to
quote.
congress
said,
"the
icc
should
be
given
explicit
direction
for
the
motor
carrier
industry
and
well
defined
parameters
within
which
it
may
act.
"
"it
should
not
attempt
to
go
beyond
the
powers
vested
in
it
by
statute.
"
now
i'll
admit
that
an
agency
ordinary
should
have
some
leeway
in
fashioning
remedies
for
the
statute
that
it
is
administering,
but
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
case
here.
since
congress,
i
think
we
showed
in
our
brief...
we
have
a
different
reading
of
the
legislative
history
than
counsel.
our
reading
of
the
legislative
history
and
what
we
showed
in
our
brief
is
that
congress
was
tempting
to
reign
in
the
agency,
and
that
they
were
being
as
explicit
as
they
knew
how
to
be
in
that
act.
so
in
those
circumstances
we
feel
that
the
commission
went
far
beyond
the
power
vested
in
it
by
adopting
this
rule.
as
to
the
question
of
the
procedural
rights,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
rule
provides
that
the
complaints
will
be
filed
with
what
is
called
the
tariff
integrity
board.
now
this
is
a
creature
of
the
icc.
there
is
no
provision
for
it
in
the
statute.
this
is
an
employee
board
that
will
act
on
these
complaints
that
a
rate
bureau
violation
occurred.
the
tariff
integrity
board's
procedures,
which
were
adopted
by
the
commission,
provide
that
the
proceedings
will
be
informal,
that
no
transcript
will
be
made,
that
subpoenas
will
not
be
issued,
and
that
oaths
will
not
be
administered.
now,
the
tarrif
integrity
board
does
not
itself
act
on
the
complaint.
it
forwards
its
recommendation
to
the
commission.
but
the
rules
do
not
say
what
happens
next.
two
things
are
possible.
the
commission
can
act
directly
on
a
tariff
integrity
board
recommendation,
strike
the
tariff
retroactively,
in
which
case
the
carriers
will
have
been
denied
these
procedural
rights
that
i
just
mentioned,
or
it
can
start
all
over
again
and
file
its
own
complaint
using
the
tariff
integrity
board's
recommendation
as
a
basis
for
its
complaint.
but
if
it
does
that
it
merely
delays
the
proceedings
and
increases
the
liability
of
the
carriers.
as
we
pointed
out,
while
the
complaint
has
to
be
filed
within
60
days
after
the
tariff
became
effective,
there
is
no
time
limit
on
when
the
commission
has
to
decide
the
issue.
the
tariff
stays
in
effect
and
the
commission
can
drag
on
the
proceeding
as
long
as
they
want.
all
increases
that
were
placed
into
effect
during
this
time
would
have
to
be
refunded.
so
what
the
commission
is
doing
with
this
duplicative
procedure
is
merely
trying...
if
that
way
it
proceeds...
is
merely
dragging
out
the
proceedings.
there
is
no
reason
for
this
at
all
except
that
the
commission
wants
to
bring
this
proceeding
within
its
tariff
integrity
board
rule
which
is
the
place
where
it
is
stated
that
it
has
this
authority
retroactively
reject
tariffs.
so
it
just
kind
of
made
up
this
system
so
that
it
can
bring
it
in
within
that
rule.
the
third
misconception
i
mentioned
was
the
icc's
refusal
to
acknowledge
that
it
will
be
unable
exercise
discretion
in
the
matter
of
refunds.
i
think
the
best
example
of
this
is
in
the
tariff
missymbolization
rule
in
the
aberdeen
case.
that
rule
flatly
provides
that
changes
resulting
in
increases
which
are
not
identified
by
proper
symbols
shall
be
considered
unlawfully
published
and
filed
and
therefore
invalid
and
not
collectible
such
cases
the
lawful
provisions
will
be
those
purportedly
superseded.
now
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
what
happen
if
there
is
a
violation
of
that
rule.
first
of
all,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
the
icc
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
shippers'
complaints
for
overcharges.
a
shipper
has
to
go
directly
to
court.
it
can
either
go
to
a
state
court
or
to
a
federal
court,
but
in
either
case
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
court
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
icc
since
it
is
a
pretty
easy
matter
to
determine
whether
a
tariff
had
been
properly
symbolized
or
not.
there
will
not
even
be
any
need
for
a
hearing
or
anything.
if
it
is
not
symbolized,
it
is
not
symbolized.
the
court
then
will
be
faced
with
the
rule
which
flatly
declares
the
tariff
invalid
and
not
collectible,
and
the
provisions
of
the
overcharge
statute
which
provides
that
all
such
charges
are
to
be
refunded.
the
court
will
have
no
discretion
whatsoever
in
the
matter.
so
the
icc
saying
that
it
has
discrection
means
nothing
in
that
case.
in
the
case
at
issue
here
and
the
rule
at
issue
here
for
violations
of
the
rate
bureau
agreements,
the
icc
will
have
some
discretion
in
this
respect.
it
can
decide
whether
or
not
the
violation
has
been
significant
as
they
put
it
in
its
order.
now,
there
is
no
standard
to
determine
what
significant
is,
but
even
more
important
the
icc
has
boxed
itself
in.
if
it
determines
that
a
violation
of
a
rate
bureau
agreement
is
significant,
then
the
tariff
is
stricken,
overcharges
are
due
and
owing,
and
a
court
will
have
to
award
them.
the
court
cannot
consider
actual
harm
to
the
shipper,
cannot
consider
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
the
commission
has
said
it
is
going
to
do
this
in
motor
carrier
cases.
yet,
in
the
cases
of
the
railroads
where
it
has
authority
to
deal
in
the
railroad
section
of
the
act,
the
icc
can
award
overcharges
or
damages.
it
has
said
in
those
cases
that
it
is
going
to
consider
violations
of
railroad
rate
bureau
agreements
under
the
damage
sections
of
the
act
so
that
it
will
require
the
shippers
to
show
or
not
show
harm,
but
not
so
in
the
case
of
motor
carriers.
there
is
no
reason
for
this
distinction.
neither
counsel
nor
the
icc
has
ever
given
us
any
reason
why
the
railroads
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
the
motor
carriers.
under
the
normal
procedures
before
the
commission
adopted
this
rule,
if
a
shipper
brought
a
complaint
in
court
and
said
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
some
provision
of
the
act,
the
court
would
have
been
free
to
decide
whether
damages
were
due
at
all,
in
the
first
place,
and
secondly,
whether
the
shipper
had
been
actually
harmed.
we
submit
that
that
is
the
only
fair
way
to
handle
this,
and
that
is
the
way
that
your
decisions
in
davis
v.
portland
seed
require.
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
the
authority
of
the
icc
to
retroactively
invalidate
effective
tariffs.
i
think
counsel
for
the
government
put
their
finger
on
the
issue
here
in
their
reply
brief.
they
said
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
is
create
a
basis
for
overcharged
liability.
we
submit
that
the
statute
says
what
is
an
overcharge
and
what
is
not,
and
that
the
commission
cannot
create
overcharge
liability.
the
overcharge
provision
of
the
act
states
at
paragraph
4
in
the
petition
at
the
very
last
page
of
the
petition
if
you
would
like
to
follow
it,
"the
common
carrier
providing
transportation
or
service
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
under
the
act
is
liable
to
a
person
for
amounts
charged
that
exceed
the
applicable
rate
for
transportation
or
service
contained
in
a
tariff
filed
under
the
act.
"
now
to
me
this
means
simply
that
if
a
tariff
is
on
file
with
the
commission
and
a
carrier
charges
more
than
is
called
for
in
that
tariff
that
carrier
is
subject
to
an
overcharge
claim
and
must
refund
the
excess.
it
does
not
involve
this
problem
at
all,
violations
of
the
act.
in
the
very
next
sentence
the
act
states...
it
provides
for
damages
sustained
by
a
person
as
a
result
of
an
act
or
omission
of
the
carrier
in
violation
of
the
act.
now,
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about
in
the
case
of
both
missymbolization
and
violations
of
rate
bureau
agreements.
we're
talking
about
violations
of
the
act.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
taking
this
whole
alouette
case,
which
reached
a
strained
interpretation
of
the
act
and
is
trying
to
ride
on
it
in
this
case
by
creating
overcharge
liability
when
there
is
none.
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
that
every
other
court
that
has
considered
that
alouette
decision
except
the
one
that
is
on
appeal
here,
the
aberdeen
case,
has
rejected
it
and
has
said
that
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever.
it
has
been
rejected
by
the
first
circuit,
by
the
d.c.
circuit
and
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
patrick
mc
eligot
well,
there
are
two
points
there.
the
first,
your
honor,
i
think
we
discussed
it
in
our
brief.
there
is
a
recent
case
called
the
central
forwarding
case
that
discusses
that
at
some
length,
and
the
point
there
is
that
the
american
trucking
case
was
decided
before
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980.
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980
set
new
limits
on
the
commission,
and
really...
i
think
the
court
said
it
is
still
good
law,
but
it
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
what
congress
said
later.
congress
said
the
commission
cannot
go
beyond
the
strict,
statutory
limits.
so,
as
i
said,
an
agency
ordinarily
would
have
some
leeway
in
this,
but
it
cannot
have
that
leeway
here
where
congress
said
otherwise.
congress
could
not
have
made
itself
more
clear.
i
would
next
like
to
discuss
the
specific
language
of
the
act,
which
the
commission
says
gives
it
authority
to
retroactively
invalidate
tariffs.
it
relies
solely
on
this
rejection
power
in
the
act.
the
rejection
authority
provides
that
the
icc
may
reject
a
tariff
submitted
to
it
by
a
common
carrier
under
the
tariff
filing
section
of
the
act
if
that
tariff
violates
that
section
or
requirements
of
the
commission
carrying
out
that
section.
that
provision
is
just
in
there
for
that
one
purpose
so
that
the
commission
can
reject
tariffs
at
the
outset
that
do
not
meet
the
tariff
filing
requirements
either
of
the
statute
or
of
its
own
tariff
circular
rules.
it
is
not
meant
to
deal
with
retroactive
invalidation
of
tariffs.
it
is
not
meant
to
deal
with
substantive
violations
of
the
act.
at
least
two
courts
have
held...
the
delta
case
cited
in
my
decision
held
that.
but
it
is
simply
to
deal
with
tariff
filing
informality
violations...
formality
violations.
it
is
not
to
deal
with
substantive
issues.
the
rate
bureau
agreement
violations
obviously
do
not
violate
either
the
tariff
filing
provisions
of
the
act
or
of
the
commission.
so
in
the
first
place
we
are
saying
that
the
commission
cannot
even
use
it
in
this
case.
however,
they
could
in
the
aberdeen
case
if
that
were
the
only
issue.
i
think
justice
o'connor
put
her
finger
on
this.
if
you
read
the
statutory
scheme
it
is
clear
what
the
rejection
authority
is
mean
to
do.
it
is
meant
merely
to
get
at
problems
right
at
the
outset.
there
are
no
procedural
steps
to
be
taken.
if
the
commission
rejects
it,
that
is
it.
later
on
the
commission
in
other
sections
of
the
act
can
suspend
and/or
investigate
for
substantive
violations,
and
it
can
after
a
full
hearing
order
tariffs
canceled
prospectively.
now,
counsel
said
that
their
reading
of
the
rejection
authority
would
not
make
those
other
provisions
superfluous,
but
we
cannot
see
why
the
commission
would
need
them
if
they
could
do
all
this
that
they
are
saying
they
could
do
under
the
rejection
authority.
if
the
commission
can
come
along
three
years
or
five
years
later
and
reject
authority
and
render
it
invalid
retroactively,
it
certainly
has
no
need
to
suspend
proposed
tariffs
or
to
cancel
effective
tariffs
after
a
full
hearing.
i
think
the
court
was
correct,
too,
in
saying
that
the
plain
meaning
of
rejection
contradicts
this
interpretation.
the
plain
meaning
according
to
court
was
to
refuse
to
accept
or
to
decline
to
receive.
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
if
that
is
the
plain
meaning...
and
i
agree
that
it
is...
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
the
commission
to
reject
a
tariff
after
it
already
accepted
it.
congress
would
have
used
the
word
"strike",
i
believe,
if
it
were
talking
about
the
type
of
authority
that
counsel
has
indicated
that
the
commission
needs
because
to
strike
a
tariff
it
could
do
that
after
it
was
already
effective,
strike
it
from
its
record.
but,
of
course,
if
it
had
meant
that,
