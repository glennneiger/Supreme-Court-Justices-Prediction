mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
a
rule
adopted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
1980
that
provides
the
commission
with
authority
to
reject
at
any
time
tariffs
filed
by
a
motor
carrier
if
those
tariffs
were
adopted
or
published
under
procedures
that
are
found
to
be
in
significant
violation
of
a
rate
bureau
agreement.
the
importance
of
the
rate
bureau
agreement
is
that
it
serves
as
the
basis
for
the
motor
carriers'
immunity
from
antitrust
liability
for
jointly
setting
and
publishing
their
rates.
this
suit
is
an
attack
on
the
rule
as
adopted
and
not
as
applied,
and
accordingly
the
facts
are
rather
sparse.
the
rule
was
adopted
in
the
aftermath
of
the
enactment
of
congress
in
1980
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
the
primary
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
increase
competition
among
motor
carriers,
and
one
of
the
significant
means
for
achieving
that
particular
purpose
was
congress'
attempt
to
restructure
the
operations
of
rate
bureaus.
rate
bureaus
had
been
created
after
1948
when
congress
adopted
the
reed-bulwinkle
act
which
conferred
the
initial
antitrust
immunity
on
rate
carriers
so
that
they
could
avoid
the
destructive
competition
that
congress
had
found
to
have
existed
in
the
past
so
that
they
could
set
their
rates
jointly
in
a
way
that
would
otherwise
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
because
the
immunity
was
perfectly
permissible.
during
the
32
years
that
the
reed-bulwinkle
act
had
been
in
effect
both
the
commission
and
congress
had
become
concerned
about
possible
abuses
in
the
rate
bureau
process,
and
some
members
of
both
congress
and
the
commission
began
to
doubt
whether
any
antitrust
immunity
was
appropriate
at
all.
in
1980
congress
comprised
on
the
issue
and
retained
a
certain
amount
of
antitrust
immunity
for
rate
carriers
but
did
so
only
in
return
on
the
condition
that
the
rate
bureaus
themselves
operate
under
very
strict
requirements
so
that
they
would
be
more
open
to
the
public
and
provide
greater
opportunity
for
competition
among
the
motor
carriers.
for
instance,
congress
required
that
bureau
meetings
be
open,
that
the
name
of
the
proponent
of
any
rate
increase
be
disclosable,
and
that
members
of
the
bureau
not
discuss
various
aspects
with
published
rates.
with
regard
to
enforcement
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act,
however,
congress
did
not
modify
the
commission's
preexisting
powers.
in
its
notice
of
proposed
rule
making
the
commission
explained
that
most
of
the
requirements
of
the
act
were
self-fulfilling,
but
nonetheless
adopted
several
substantive
provisions
designed
to
provide
very
clear
guidance
to
the
motor
carriers
with
regard
to
precisely
how
they
should
operate
in
order
to
assure
the
continuance
of
their
antitrust
immunity.
the
only
one
of
those
rules
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
commission's
decision
to
adopt
rejection,
as
it
is
called,
of
the
carrier's
tariff
filing
as
a
potential
sanction
in
cases
where
the
commission
finds
after
a
hearing
and
the
possibility
ultimately
of
judicial
review
that
the
tariff
is
the
product
of
a
significant
violation
of
a
rate
bureau
agreement.
the
commission
thereby
asserted
its
authority
in
appropriate
cases
to
declare
the
filed
tariff
to
be
invalid
ab
initio
and
thereby
to
subject
the
carrier
to
overcharged
liability
under
section
11705(b)(1).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
usual
remedy
in
what
context?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
cases
of
significant
rate
bureau
violations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the
commission
retained
the
option
of
exercising
any
of
its
other
enforcement
powers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
could
bring
a
civil
proceeding
for
a
penalty,
could
decide
to
declare
the
rate
invalid
and
prescribe
a
rate
for
the
future,
the
traditional
remedies
it
had
always
used.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
could
require
adjustments.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
stevens,
it
could
revoke
approval
of
the
rate
bureau
agreement.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
rate
bureaus
are
the
ones
ordinarily
who
file
tariffs,
and
as
a
consequence
they
are
the
ones
who
would
be
placing
the
symbols
on
the
tariffs,
but
the
symbolization
requirement
applies
to
anyone
who
files
a
tariff.
so
if
an
individual
motor
carrier
were
to
do
so
he
would
be
obliged
to
comply
with
that
rule.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
it's
an
independent
violation
of
the
regulation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
would
be
possible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
a
necessary
conflict,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure.
presumably
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
rate
bureau
review
process
was
to
make
sure
that
the
shippers
have
an
opportunity
to
have
some
involvement
in
the
negotiations
for
setting
the
rates
so
that
if
the
meetings
for
the
rate
bureaus
were
closed
to
the
shippers
or
if
the
shippers
were
in
some
other
way
excluded
from
that
process
so
that
rates
were
set
higher
than
they
might
otherwise
have
been
as
the
shipper
had
had
an
opportunity
to
participate
and
the
commission
were
to
find
in
its
own
view
that
if
the
rate
bureau
open
process
had
been
allowed
to
function
as
it
should
have,
that
the
higher
rate
would
not
have
been
set,
then
it
might
well
be
the
commission's
judgment
that
that
higher
rate
should
not
be
permitted.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
it
has
the
right
to
suspend
it
within
the
30-day
period,
but
it
may
or
may
not--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
not
nearly
so
much
as
the
symbolization
rule,
justice
o'connor.
frankly
the
problem
inherent
in
the
rate
bureau
process
is
one
of
general
secrecy.
i
mean
the
whole
reason
congress
modified
the
rate
bureau
process
was
to
make
it
less
secret
so
that
it
could
well
be
that
violations
of
the
requirements
for
rate
bureaus
would
simply
make
them
more
secret
and,
therefore,
make
it
more
difficult
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
violations.
so
i
think
there
was
an
inherent
difficulty
in
complying
with
the
30-day
problem
even
before
the
commission's
budgetary
problems,
but
certainly
having
less
resources
makes
it
much
more
difficult
frankly
to
be
able
to
investigate
rate
bureau
violations
within
the
30-days.
rationale
for
the
adoption
of
the
rejection
remedy
by
the
commission
was
that
it
simply
lacked
an
effective
remedy
for
significant
violations
of
rate
bureau
agreements
under
the
preexisting
law
and
that
the
adoption
of
rejection
was
a
direct
and
efficient
administrative
response
to
the
peculiar
problems
that
have
been
created
by
the
operation
of
the
rate
bureaus.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
in
10762(e)
it
makes
specific
reference
to
rejection.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
certainly
the
commission
is
bound
by
the
statute
with
regard
to
that;
however,
10762(e)
does
not,
by
its
terms,
make
any
reference
to
rejection.
moreover,
the
commission--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
was
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
you
can
only
properly
define
rejection
that
way.
however,
a
proper
definition
of
rejection
is
to
cast
out
or
to
eject
which
presumably
would
have
something
to
do
with
something
that
was
already
effective.
moreover,
i
do
not
think
it
is
appropriate
to
tell
an
agency
precisely
how
it
should
operate
by
reference
to
dictionary
definitions.
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
that
particular
phrase
that
evinces
a
clear
intention
by
congress
to
restrict
how
the
commission
operates,
and
our
submission
is
that
that
kind
of
a
showing
is
what
this
court's
prior
decisions
have
found.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
this
particular
statutory
scheme.
the
remedies
that
are
available
all
sort
of
miss
the
basic
point
of
what
the
commission's
trying
to
achieve
through
the
use
of
the
specialized
rejection
power.
there
are
alternative
remedies
available,
no
question
about
that,
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
american
trucking
association
case
before
that
you
don't
look
down
the
list
of
provisions
to
see
whether
the
specific
one
the
commission
has
sought
to
apply
exist,
but
rather
you
determine
whether
given
the
mission
of
the
commission
the
particular
enforcement
device
that
it
has
in
fact
adopted
is
consistent
with
that
mission,
not
with
any
specific
provision.
i
don't
believe,
frankly,
that
you
can
go
through
and
find
that...
it
might
well
be
appropriate
to
say
the
commission
cannot
follow
this
course
of
action
if
its
efforts
were
to
make
superfluous
some
preexisting
arrangement
that
congress
has
set
out,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
so
in
the
absence
of
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
structure
of
the
act
does
not
in
any
way
cavern
the
commission's
discretion
to
choose
an
enforcement
technique
that
is
appropriate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
a
three
year
statute
of
limitations
for
an
overcharge
liability
so
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--sure.
you
could
reject,
but
you
could
not
impose
overcharge
liability
for
the
total
period.
i
think
it
is
important
to
realize
that
commission's
position
here
is
that
we
believe
that
the
rejection
authority
made
specifically
a
matter
of
statutory
provision
in
10762(e)
is
helpful
but
that
the
commission
also
relies
on
its
inherent
authority,
the
broader
sort
of
notion
of
rejection
similar
to
what
court
held
in
the
united
gas
pipeline
v.
mobil
gas
case.
so
we
do
have
two
alternative
theories
involve
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
absence
of
some
indication,
i
submit,
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
that
congress
set
out
those
three
that
those
were
the
ones
that
had
in
mind
and
meant
for
the
commission
not
to
go
beyond
those
three.
our
position
would
be
consistent
with
the
earlier
american
trucking
association
case
that
congress
doesn't
sit
down
and
figure
out
every
aspect
of
how
the
interstate
commission
is
going
to
perform
its
job
and
that
the
specific
reference
to
certain
enforcement
mechanisms
in
no
way
necessarily
restricts
the
comission
from
using
additional
mechansims
so
long
as
those
satisfy
the
aim
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
enforcment
of
the
rate
bureau
agreements.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
that
setting
out
would
necessarily
preclude
what
the
commission
has
done
here.
respondents
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
challenging
many
of
the
rate
bureau
regulations
adopted
by
the
commission,
and
the
court
upheld
most
of
the
substantive
regulations
but
rejected
the
rejection
rule
in
this
case.
in
holding
that
the
commission
had
no
power
to
reject
the
rate
that
had
gone
into
effect
after
30
days,
the
court
did
reject
additional
contentions
that
had
been
made
by
the
respondents.
first,
the
court
held
that
the
rejection
authority
mentioned
in
10762(e)
is
not
restricted
simply
to
rejecting
problems
in
rate
filing
procedural
defects
but
is
also
available
for
substantive
unlawfulness.
second,
it
held
that
the
commission's
authority
over
rate
bureau
agreements
was
not
limited
to
declaring
them
unlawful,
but
rather
the
commission
could
also
adopt
sanctions
in
addition
to
declaring
the
agreement
unlawful.
the
court
held,
however,
that
free
or
post-effective
rejection
was
inappropriate
on
three
grounds:
first,
the
dictionary
definition
of
rejection,
which
i
have
already
discussed;
second,
the
court
held
that
it
would
violate
a
statutory
policy
favoring
stability
of
rates;
and
third,
the
court
reasoned
that
prior
decisions
of
this
court
precluded
rejection
of
effective
rates.
this
court
has
held
that
the
determination
of
how
best
to
enforce
the
national
transportation
policy
as
embodied
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
act
is
a
matter
firmly
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
the
commission's
authority
in
this
regard
does
not
depend
upon
the
express
provision
of
a
specific
power.
there
is
a
legitimate,
reasonable
and
direct
relationship
between
the
asserted
enforcement
authority
and
a
mandate
of
the
statute,
and
the
commission's
rule
must
be
upheld.
i've
already
discussed
the
dictionary
definition
problem
of
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis.
equally
unavailing
is
the
court
of
appeals'
reliance
on
the
stability
of
rates
as
a
statutory
policy.
it
is
clear
that
the
1980
act
was
designed
to
increase
flexibility
in
rates,
not
to
guarantee
their
stability
at
all
costs,
and
that
the
commission's
rejection
rule
in
this
context
furthers
the
competition
element
of
the
act
and
does
not
great--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
commission
does
have
the
power
to
reject
for
lack
of
information
although
the
tariff
filing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
o'connor,
in
order
to
use
the
power
you
are
talking
about
there
would
have
to
be
something
in
the
tariff
filing
itself
that
would
make
clear
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
rate
bureau
operation
problem,
and
tariff
filings
are
just
a
set
of
numbers
which
do
not
in
any
way
give
you
any
insights
into
whether
there
may
have
been
a
tariff
rate
filing
problem.
so
the
commission
would
be
obliged
to
do
one
of
two
things,
either
disregard
the
rate
bureau
operation
problems
or
have
to
suspend
every
rate
increase
in
order
to
investigate
whether
or
not
the
rate
bureau
operation
has
been
complied
with.
neither
of
those
seem
particularly
appropriate,
and
this
much
more
tailored
remedy
seems
much,
much
more
suitable
at
least
in
the
view
of
the
commission.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
some
deterrent
value
to
having
antitrust
liability--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
commission
recognized
that
but
nonetheless
believed
that...
the
antitrust
liability
notion
is
cumbersome.
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
shippers
exclusively
who
may
or
may
not
have
a
direct
interest
in
bringing
the
suits
and
who
may
not
want
to
risk
it
whereas
this
is
in
the
hands
of
the
commission--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
attorney
may
be
willing
to
undertake
the
expense.
i
do
not
know
that
the
shipper
would
necessarily
want
to
pursue
the
matter
particularly.
it
may
just
not
be
in
their
interest.
i
do
not
dispute
that
there
is
some
deterrent
force,
no
question
about
that,
but
in
the
commission's
view
it
was
simply
not
sufficient,
and
it
was
not
in
the
commission's
hands
which
was
the
real
problem
in
the
preexisting
rate
bureau
regulatory
scheme.
they
lacked
the
power
to
take
action.
moreover,
perhaps
in
some
respects
treble
damages
is
an
overkill
remedy
for
the
particular
problem
that
the
commission
retains
greater
discretion
to
tailor
this
particular
relief
more
effectively
than
a
treble
damage
award
might.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
significant
violations?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
rule
has
been
in
effect
since
the
end
of
1980,
and
we
do
not
have
any--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
problem
with
the
1948
to
1980
period
was
that
the
thrust
of
the
commission's
regulatory
efforts
was
made
in
approving
rate
bureau
agreements
and
reviewing
what
agreements
furthered
the
national
transportation
policy.
there
was
virtually
no
attention
paid
to...
once
you
had
an
agreement
in
effect...
how
it
was
to
be
operated.
the
commission
believed
that
the
1980
motor
carrier
act
in
that
act
congress
expected
for
the
commission
to
review
more
carefully
how
the
rate
bureaus
themselves
operate
and
worry
less
about
the
agreements
since
congress
had
provided
the
express
requirements
for
those
agreements.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
certainly
a
theoretical
element
to
it
any
time
a
litigant
challenges
a
rule
on
its
fact
rather
than
wait
for
it
to
be
applied.
that
is
going
to
be
an
inherent
problem.
certainly
in
our
view
in
dealing
with
it
as
a
theoretical
matter
we
think
it
inappropriate
to
deal
with
extreme
hypothetical
applications
but
rather
the
more
central
purposes
for
which
the
commission
adopted
this
particular
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
this
court's
decisions
in
portland
seed
and
berwind-white
required
rejection
of
the
commission's
rule.
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
our
position
is
that
those
decisions
indicate
that
a
shipper
cannot
seek
a
judicial
order
requiring
rejection
of
an
effective
tariff,
but
they
say
nothing
about
the
power
of
the
commission
to
modify
the
sanctions
that
will
best
enforce
this
particular
legislation.
on
that
issue,
it
seems,
that
this
court's
decisions
in
american
trucking,
chesapeake
&
ohio
and
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
rate
cases
make
plain
that
this
is
a
matter
clearly
within
the
commission's
discretion.
finally,
i
just
suggest
why
we
believe
that
this
particular
rule
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
since
that's
the
standard
to
be
applied.
in
the
first
place,
it
serves
a
very
powerful
deterrent
function.
in
the
second
place,
it
deprives
the
motor
carrier
of
the
benefit
of
a
clearly
unlawful
tariff
which
is
a
just
consequence
and
one
that
the
overcharge
liability
is
designed
to
further.
moreover,
providing
the
overcharge
relief
to
the
shipper
will
encourage
them
to
help
the
commission
to
police
these
particular
provisions
in
a
way
that
should
encourage
enforcement
of
these
operations
that
congress
believed
were
so
important.
finally,
this
particular
remedy
is
one
that
the
commission
itself
can
exercise,
which
is
important
in
being
able
to
tailor
the
relief
to
the
particular
circumstances
where
it
is
appropriate.
accordingly,
it
seems
clearly
reasonable
and
under
this
court's
prior
decisions
the
rule
should
be
upheld.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
has
what
always
been
the
commission's
view?
that
we
have
the
power
to
reject?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
commission
adopted
the
rule
in
1980.
it
has
always
taken
the
view
that
it
can
reject
for
various
reasons
unlawful
rates
and
require
overcharges.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
retroactively.
it
has
not
often
found
need
to
undertake
that,
frankly,
but
the
commission,
i
think,
reasonably
concluded
that
congress
in
1980
placed
a
special
burden
on
the
commission
in
enforcing
rate
bureau
operations.
that's
why
this
particular
device
was
used
in
this
particular
context.
if
there
are
no
questions
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
stevens,
i
may
have
been
a
little
short
in
my
answer
to
your
question
on
whether
there
was
a
square
conflict
between
this
decision
and
the
aberdeen
case.
in
our
view
there
is
a
conflict
over
the
interpretation
of
the
rejection
language.
in
order
to
avoid
a
conflict
one
would
have
to
find
that
the
missymbolization
rule
is
itself
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
not
consistent
with
the
statutory
authority.
so
there
is
a
conflict.
it
is
not
one
that
could
not
be
avoided,
but
certainly
an
ample
justification
for
having
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
with
regard
to
the
scope
of
these
various
powers
that
are
available,
one
point
that
i
probably
could
have
made
earlier
with
regard
to
the
difference
between
the
suspension
and
the
rejection
authority
that
the
commission
exercises
here
is
that
the
power
to
suspend
is
expressly
limited
to
the
proposed
tariffs
whereas
rejection
is
in
no
way
limited
to
any
kinds
of
times
limits--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
proposed
rules
themselves
do
not
discuss
what
hearing
would
be
provided
for.
the
tariff
integrity
board
is
made
mention
of,
and
the
commission
at
that
time
did
expect
that
the
tariff
integrity
board
would
be
the
body
that
would
proceed
on
these
matters.
however,
the
eleventh
circuit
declared
the
process
followed
by
the
tariff
integrity
board
to
be
unlawful,
and
the
tariff
integrity
board
is
for
all
intents
and
purposes
defunct.
it
is
the
commission's
intention
to
follow
a
complaint
and
full
hearing
procedure
just
as
it
would
on
any
other
investigation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
after
rejection.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
after
the
effective
date
you
mean?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
they
file
a
complaint
suggesting
rejection
and
then
go
ahead
and
proceed
with
the
entire...
the
same
process
they
use
for
any
other
post-effective
action
on
a
particular
rate
that
exists.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
american
trucking
association
case,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
1980
act
that
congress
in
any
way
meant
to
modify
that.
it
did
restrict
the
commission's
authority
substantively
to
deal
with
rate
bureaus.
it
in
no
way
intended
to
modify
the
commission's
ability
to
enforce
the
act,
and
indeed
expressly
stated
that
it
retained
the
same
authority
to
deal
with
overcharges
that
it
had
always
had
so
that
american
trucking
is
still
good
authority
and
justifies
rejection
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
