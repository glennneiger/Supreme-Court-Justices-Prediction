unknown
speaker
what
about
the
rest
of
the
facts?
he
sent
word
out
and
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
say?
did
he
want
to
talk
or
what,
the
officer?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
then
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
other
admissions
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
what
statements
were
admitted
at
his
trial,
the
ones
in
the
car--
unknown
speaker
--and
anything
prior
to
that?
unknown
speaker
any
of
his
statements
prior
to
that?
unknown
speaker
later
when?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
one?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
defense
of
the
statements
made
the
day
before?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but,
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
the
way
he
did,
wouldn't
some
of
the
statements
that
might
be
excluded
initially
under
miranda
and
edwards
be
admissible
on
cross
examination?
unknown
speaker
but
then
his
statements
in
the
new
trial,
his
testimony
wouldn't
be
presented
any
more
than
the
adverse
testimony.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
would
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
did
differently
after
edwards
than
what
you
thought
was
required
before?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
tell
your
officers
before
edwards
when
a
person
being
interrogated
asked
for
a
lawyer?
what
were
the
outstanding
orders
to
the
police
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
a
rule
on
whether
you
could
start
reinterrogation
after
any
specific--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
says...
i
mean,
the
passage
of
miranda
they
quote,
until
they
had
consulted
with
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
plain
in
miranda,
that
you
weren't
suppose
to
talk
to
him
a
second
time
until
he
talked
to
a
lawyer
in
the
interval?
unknown
speaker
was
it
your
view
that
the
police
could
just
wait
a
couple
of
hours
while
he
had
an
opportunity
to
exercise
the
right
and
then
just
go
back
in?
unknown
speaker
the
could
initiate
the
second
conversation?
unknown
speaker
even
though
they
knew
he
hadn't
consulted
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
telling
me
it
was
the
policy
of
your
office,
once
that
is
done,
you
can
go
back
in
and
question
him
again
any
time
you
want
to?
unknown
speaker
was
it
before
edwards?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
request
for
a
lawyer
did
not
deter
the
prosecutor
or
the
police
from
reinterrogating
whenever
they
decided
to
by
just
giving
the
second
set
of
warnings.
that
is
the
way
you
read
miranda.
i
mean,
your
office
read
miranda.
unknown
speaker
but
your
whole
case
depends
on
there
having
been
a
change
in
the
rules
and
you
say
you
don't
know
what
the
rules
were
before.
unknown
speaker
will
you
tell
me
what
in
miranda
says
you
can
go
back
over
and
over
again?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
just
said
that.
unknown
speaker
over
and
over
again.
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
drive
him
instead
of
flying
him
from
town
to
town?
did
they
drive
him
for
the
purpose
of
talking
to
him?
unknown
speaker
because
of
airline
service?
unknown
speaker
or
lunch.
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
a
ten-hour
drive.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
unusual.
i
am
just
talking
about
to
take
a
lot
of
time
when
a
man
is
just
constantly
telling
him
about
his
miranda
rights
and
all,
you
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
you
keep
giving
him
his
miranda
warnings?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
you
said
he
just
continued
to
talk
on
and
on,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
give
him
miranda
warnings
over
and
over
again?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
that
you
don't
say
innis
against
rhode
island.
you
may
recall
that
case.
there
the
officers
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car
engaged
in
a
conversation
which,
although
not
directed
at
the
accused,
clearly
prompted
him
to
tell
them
where
the
gun
and
other
incriminating
evidence
was
to
be
found.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
this
conduct
of
the
police
here
is
acceptable
under
innis?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
challenge
any
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
version
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
expect
us
to...
why
shouldn't
we
accept
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that--
unknown
speaker
--because
you
say...
in
your
version
here,
you
say
after
they
got
in
the
car
nothing
really
happened
relative
to
the
murder
until
he
started
sobbing
and
yet
your
opposition
says
that
the
respondent
was
advised
of
his
miranda
rights
and
questioning
began
almost
immediately.
the
purpose
of
the
question
was
to
elicit
further
incriminating
statements
from
respondent.
is
that
false?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
questioning
aimed
at
eliciting
incriminating
statements?
unknown
speaker
but,
he
made
no
incriminating
statements
during
that
20
minutes?
unknown
speaker
that
he
was
present.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
statements
the
day
before
weren't
admissible.
were
these
statements
made
in
the
car
admitted
in
evidence
also?
unknown
speaker
they
were,
during
this
20
minutes?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
knew
they
had
a
murder
case
as
soon
as
they
found
the
body,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
couldn't,
but
a
physician
could
and
did,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
don't
get
the
point
of
this
ten
days
that
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
lose
me.
the
point
is,
of
course,
they
wouldn't
go
five
or
six
hundred
miles
if
they
didn't
think
they
were
going
to
fetch
a
suspect.
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
the
statements
made
when
they
were
60
to
90
miles
away
from
sioux
falls,
as
it
was
described
and
is
described
in
the
record,
that
he
became
emotional
and
said
he
wanted
to
get
it
out,
do
you
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
do
you
challenge
that
it
occurred
first?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
verdict
would
suggest
that
they
rejected
his
testimony
and
believed
the
officers,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
this
particular
question
about
the
polygraph?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
way
you
stated
it
and
it
isn't
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
nor
the
district
court.
he
just
wanted
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
about
that
question
about
a
polygraph.
unknown
speaker
on
what
do
you
base
that?
unknown
speaker
on
what
do
you
base
that
statement
that
it
was
a
broader
question
than
about
the
polygraph?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
district
court
find?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
rely
on
the
district
court's
findings
for
its
statements.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
are
we
to
understand
the
record
any
other
way
then?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
then.
we
can
read
the
record.
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
all
he
meant
to
say
was
i
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer
before
i
answer
your
question
about
the
polygraph.
suppose
that
was
it,
the
questioning
stopped.
then
do
you
think
edwards
would
prevent
the
lawyers
from
coming
back
and
asking
him
about
something
else
besides
the
polygraph?
unknown
speaker
that
can
be
a
yes
or
no
answer,
can't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say,
yes.
you
say,
yes,
they
would
be
prevented
from
coming
back
and
asking
any
questions.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
to
take
that
position.
why?
now
tell
me
why.
unknown
speaker
what
in
this
case
was
it
that
he
wanted
to
remain
silent
to
use
your
words?
unknown
speaker
when
did
he
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
words
do
you
say
he
said
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
said
i
want
to
see
my
attorney
to
find
out
what
time
of
day
it
is?
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
but,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
where
he
said...
you
agree
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
where
he
said
hold
off
until
i
see
my
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
there
is
the
next
day
but
not
on
that
day.
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about,
that
day.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
where
he
said
let's
hold
off
until
i
talk
to
my
lawyer
or
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
until
i
talk
to
my
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
take
your
pick.
unknown
speaker
address
us
all.
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
two
hours
a
minute
ago.
now
you
say
two
minutes.
didn't
you
say
they
questioned
him
for
two
hours
that
morning?
unknown
speaker
and,
he
said,
as
to
two
questions
in
that
time,
he
said
i
want
my
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
is
that
all
you
have
got?
have
you
got
some
more?
unknown
speaker
but
he
still
said
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
before
answering
the
question
about
the
polygraph.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what--
--mr.
mcgreevy?
unknown
speaker
to
take
just
a
hypothetical
case,
kind
of
based
on
the
circumstances
that
you
have
been
describing,
supposing
that
you
have
a
defendant
in
custody
like
your
friend
norm,
as
you
refer
to
him,
and
he
is
being
interrogated
by
the
police,
and
there
have
been
no
miranada
violations
up
to
that
time,
and
then
he
is
asked
by
one
of
the
police,
will
you
take
a
polygraph
test
to
clear
yourself
and
he
replies,
before
answering
the
question
about
the
polygraph
test,
i
would
like
to
talk
to
my
attorney,
and,
the
police
then
say,
okay,
we
won't
talk
any
more
about
the
polygraph
test,
let's
talk
about
where
you
were
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
now,
is
there
any
sort
of
a
violation
by
that
question?
unknown
speaker
miranda
is
mostly
dicta,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
all
of
those
facts
were
presented
to
the
case
by
the
situation
of
the
arizona
imprisonment
out
of
which
it
arose?
unknown
speaker
then
isn't
it
dicta?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
of
all
dicta,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
before
us
though,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
aren't
all
of
these
preliminary
questions
really
merged
into
the
final
statement
60
to
90
miles
from
sioux
falls?
in
other
words,
suppose
nothing
is
admissible
except
that
final
statement.
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
that
is
the
facts
that
we
are
bound
to
accept.
isn't
that
the
state
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
when
he
got
emotionally
upset.
unknown
speaker
and
said
i
want
to
tell
you
about
this
in
words
to
that
effect.
nobody
has
asked
him
any
questions
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
aren't
we
obliged
to
accept
as
a
fact
that
that
was
a
spontaneous
declaration
by
him?
unknown
speaker
sixty
to
90
miles
away
from
sioux
falls.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
rejected
his
testimony
on
it
and
accepted
the
police
testimony
on
it
and
that
is
consistent
with
all
of
the
independent
fact
findings
of
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
mcgreevy,
that
is
basically
a
factual
conclusion,
isn't
it,
whether
something
that
had
happened
the
previous
afternoon
did
or
did
not
motivate
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
make
what
the
chief
has
described
as
a
spontaneous
statement?
what
are
the
findings
of
the
district
or
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
particular
issue
if
there
are
any
findings?
we
shouldn't
be
speculating
here
whether
one
thing,
in
fact,
caused
another.
unknown
speaker
he
also
said
i
didn't
mean
to
kill
her.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
blame
you.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
90
miles
east
of
sioux
falls
were
not
the
result
of
interrogation.
are
you
saying
that
the
eighth
circuit
found
the
statement
in
sioux
falls
as
a
result
of
interrogation
early
in
the
morning?
unknown
speaker
then
when
did
interrogation
take
place
in
the
car
under
your
view
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
would
quite
naturally
and
i
think
properly
prompt
interrogation,
couldn't
it?
if
someone...
a
defendant
out
of
clear
blue
sky
said
taking
a
human
life
is
so
useless.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
is
not
talking
about
the
green
bay
packers.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
that
the
second
interrogation
on
the
first
day
was
improper
and,
therefore,
the
interrogation
for
the
first
half
hour
of
the
second
day
was
proper.
suppose
that
we
agree
to
that.
if
there
hadn't
been
any
prior
interrogation
at
all,
no
prior
claim
of
counsel
at
all,
the
interrogation
in
the
automobile
for
the
first
half
hour
would
have
been
perfectly
all
right
after
miranda
warnings.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
anything
that
happened
on
the
first
day?
unknown
speaker
then
i
would
think
the
first
half
hour
of
interrogation
was
quite
proper
the
second
day.
unknown
speaker
at
the
end
of...
at
the
very
end.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcgreevy,
have
you
finished
answering
justice
white?
unknown
speaker
what
i
would
like
to
ask
is
whether
this
court
has
ever
held
before
edwards
that
once
a
defendant
has
requested
the
right
to
see
counsel
that
the
only
subsequent
event
that
would
enable
law
enforcement
to
continue
any
discussions
with
him
whatever
was
when
the
defendant
himself
initiated
that
discussion?
prior
to
edwards
have
we
ever
held
that
before?
unknown
speaker
just
cite
the
case.
unknown
speaker
just
cite
the
case
in
which
we
held
that.
unknown
speaker
did
edwards
cite
any
prior
cases
which
we--
unknown
speaker
--did
it
cite
any
prior
cases?
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
miranda?
unknown
speaker
did
miranda
hold
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this?
did
miranda
overrule
zerbst?
it
said
you
may
waive
almost
any
constitutional
right.
you
can
certainly
waive
the
right
to
have
counsel
when
you
are
being
interrogated.
and,
zerbst
said
that
you
look
to
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances.
was
that
overruled
in
miranda?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
prior
to
edwards
that
said
that?
the
answer
is
no.
you
haven't
been
able
to
cite
one.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
miranda
modified
zerbst?
it
didn't
say
so.
unknown
speaker
zerbst
has
been
cited
any
number
of
times
since.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
read
the
edwards
opinion
itself
as
purporting
to
announce
a
new
rule?
i
have
in
mind
specifically
the
sentence
quoted
on
page
11
of
your
opponent's
brief.
"we
reconfirm
these
views,
and
to
lend
them
substance.
"
we
do
so
and
so
after
quoting
from
miranda.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
my
question.
do
you
think
the
opinion
in
edwards
purported
to
announce
a
new
rule?
unknown
speaker
is
there
language
in
the
opinion
that
purports
to
adopt
a
new
rule?
why
would
they
say
"we
reconfirm
these
views"?
that
is
purporting
to
announce
a
new
rule?
