mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
out,
first
of
all,
spending
a
few
minutes
going
over
the
facts.
i
think
that
in
some
respects
the
facts
have
not
been
stated
as
i
would
like
to
have
them
stated
at
this
point.
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
while
this
case
originated
in
1973,
the
miranda
decision
of
this
court
was,
of
course,
handed
down
seven
years,
a
full
seven
years
prior
to
the
facts
that
give
rise
to
this
case.
and,
i
think
that
we
need
to
bear
in
mind
that
while
the
ten
years
and
two
months
that
mr.
stumes
has
been
in
prison
is
a
long
time,
the
17
years
since
miranda
is
even
longer.
we
have
a
situation
in
this
case
where
on
september
17,
1973,
the
body
of
the
victim
is
found.
my
client,
norman
stumes,
is
located
in
green
bay,
wisconsin,
ten
days
later.
so,
it
is
not
a
situation
where
a
suspect
is
found
immediately
following
an
alleged
crime
and
immediately
confesses,
thereby
making
further
independent
investigation
by
the
authorities
seem
pointless.
there
was
a
period
of
time.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
by
the
time
these
detectives
got
to
green
bay
to
question
and
transport
norm
stumes,
they
already
knew
they
had
a
murder
case.
they
had
a
pathologist
who
indicated
that
the
cause
of
death
and
the
other
circumstances
of
death
were
such
as
to
make
it
a
homicide
case.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
i
suppose
one
could
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
just
by
looking
at
the
body
you
couldn't
necessarily
tell
that
it
was
a
felonious
or
a
criminal
act.
but,
by
the
time--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--that
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
my
point
is
that
during
the
course
of
the
ten
days
the
authorities
took
hair
samples
from
the
victim,
from
the
body
of
the
victim,
and
from
the
apartment,
from
the
shower
of
the
apartment,
from
other
areas
of
the
apartment.
they
attempted
to
take,
i
believe,
fingerprints.
they
took
blood
samples
from
the
body
of
the
victim.
so
they
did
a
lot
of
things
to
attempt
to
establish
their
case
and
to
put
their
case
together.
my
point
then
was
that
by
the
time
they
went
to
green
bay
they
had
a
prime
suspect
and
that
appears
in
the
record,
i
believe,
quite
clearly.
they
also
knew,
of
course,
that
norm's
mother...
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
i
understood
the
attorney
general
to
argue
that
in
cases
where
you
have
a
confession
that
is
secured
very
quickly,
and
i
believe
he
inferred
that
occurred
here,
the
police,
in
effect,
have
a
disincentive
to
put
together
a
case
that
is
based
on
other
than
a
confession.
i
was
pointing
out
that
that,
i
don't
think,
is
the
situation
here.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
do
i
challenge
the
admissibility
of
those
statements?
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
must
say
that
mr.
stumes
at
trial
testified
that
it
never
happened,
that
that
is
part
of
the
record
made
at
the
trial.
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
session
here
today,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
the
allegations
of
the
police
to
have
been
true.
it
is--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
would
say
that
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
before
we
get
to
that
conversation
in
the
car,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
we
need
to
back
up
to
the
first
session
of
interrogation.
that
is
the
one
that
took
place
from
around
9:30
in
the
morning
to
about
11:00
in
the
morning
in
the
jail
in
green
bay,
wisconsin.
that
interrogation
was
conducted
primarily
by
a
single
officer,
green,
detective
green,
as
mr.
meierhenry
has
indicated
is
now
deceased.
that
interrogation
was
preceded
by
full
explanation
of
miranda
rights.
during
that
interrogation,
norm
indicated
that,
yes,
he
knew
the
victim,
but,
no,
he
had
not
been
to
the
victim's
residence,
he
had
not
been
in
the
victim's
bedroom,
he
had
not
had
intercourse
with
the
victim.
towards
the
end
of
that
session,
detective
green
indicates
that
he
wants
to
know
whether
norm
is
willing
to
take
a
polygraph
to
clear
himself
as
so
many
others
had
done.
norm
indicated
that
he
needed
to
talk
to
steve,
that
he
needed
to
talk
to
steve
before
he
answered
that
question,
steve
being
the
attorney
that--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--it
was
broader
than
that
in
the
record.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
believe
in
my
brief
in
the
citations
to
the
transcript,
i
believe
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
broader
request
than
merely
in
response
to
the
polygraph
question.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
pardon
me?
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
believe
i
base
it
on
a
transcript
reference
and
i
need
to
check
that
right
now.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
believe
the
district--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit,
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
referred
only
to
a
request
to
talk
to
steve
prior
to
answering
the
polygraph
question.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
that
is
true.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
guess
the
way
i
would
approach
that
is
to
suggest
that
i
don't
think
that
the
district
court
or
the
eighth
circuit
necessarily
alluded
to
every
factual
element
that
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
not
only
would
edwards--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
think
it
can
be
a
yes
answer,
but
when
you
finish
i
might
try
and
explain
a
little
further.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
thank
you.
my
theory
on
this
case
has
been
that
one
need
never
even
get
to
edwards
to
properly
decide
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
miranda
says
is
that
if
a
suspect
indicates
that
he
wants
to
remain
silent
questioning
must
cease.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
he
didn't
in
those
words.
my
point
is--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--when
he
indicated
that
he
wanted
his
attorney.
to
me,
that
is--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
think
that
is
an
unlikely
comment
for
him
to
make
being
interrogated
regarding
a
homicide.
but,
i
suppose
if
that
is
what
the
testimony
was,
then
we
might
not
be
here
under
these
circumstances,
but
that
is
not
what
he
was
getting
at
and
that
is
not
the
way
the
detectives
interpreted
it.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
oh,
there
certainly
is.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
if
i
might...
i
am
not
sure
which
of
the
justices
i
should
address
at
the
moment,
but--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--okay.
[laughter]
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
all
right.
a
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
request
was
a
specific
request
only
to
talk
to
steve
before
the
polygraph
question
was
answered.
in
the
brief,
we
indicate
that
in
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript
at
page
49
and
50...
and
understand
that
that
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
doesn't
come
from
norm
stumes,
that
comes
from
a
detective.
they
indicated
that
green
in
that
first
interrogation
asked
if
he
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
joyce
hoff
and
to
that
norman
replied
he
would
rather
not
answer
until
he
talked
to
steve.
a
moment
or
two
later
in
the
same
interrogation,
green
says
do
you
want
to
clear
yourself
by
taking
a
polygraph
like
everybody
else
has?
"x
number
of
people"
is
the
term
they
used.
and,
he
said
he
would
like
to
talk
to
steve
before
answering
that
question.
so,
two
times
in
a
period
of
apparently
a
minute
or
two
there
is
a
request
for
counsel.
then,
what
happened--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--the
first
interrogation
session,
i
think,
was
about
one
hour
and
45
minutes.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
those,
i
believe,
the
record
would
show--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--yes,
i
sure...
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
those
two
questions
that
i
specifically
mentioned
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
hour
and
45
minutes
in
this
isolated
interrogation
with
norman
stumes
and
green.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
and
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
his
attorney
before
he
answered
whether
he
was
involved
in
the
death.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
under
the
way
i
would
interpret
miranda,
i
think
that
that
is
a
violation.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
not
the
way
i
view
it,
i
guess.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
no,
i
am
sure
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
perhaps
in
a
technical
sense
it
is,
but
i
think
that
it
expressed
the
opinion
of
the
court
at
the
time
the
decision
was
handed
down.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
point
of
the
second
interrogation,
because
i
think
that
may
be
key
to
our
analysis.
after
this
first
interrogation
of
an
hour
and
45
minutes
where
we
have
denials,
denials,
denials,
ending
with
two
requests
to
talk
to
steve,
the
detectives
leave
or
i
should
say
green
leaves.
later
in
that
afternoon
detectives
green
and
skadsen
return
to
once
again
interrogate
stumes.
there
is
no
advice
given
regarding
the
miranda
rights,
the
constitutional
rights,
no
advice
of
those
rights
at
all.
it
is
during
the
course
of
that
interrogation...
this
is
an
interrogation
that
judge
nichol
found
to
have
violated
miranda.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
district
court
found
this
interrogation
to
violate
miranda.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
no,
but
i
think
that
it
provides
the
linchpin
to
explain
what
happened
the
next
day,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
view.
during
that
interrogation,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
officers,
they
got
mr.
stumes
to
admit
that
he
had
lied
in
the
morning.
they
got
him,
according
to
their
testimony,
to
admit
that,
yes,
i
had
been
there
at
the
time
in
question,
yes,
i
had
been
in
the
bedroom,
yes,
yes,
we
had
had
intercourse,
and
then
at
the
end,
again,
without
the
benefit
of
miranda,
they
asked
the
question...
green
asked
the
question,
was
it
accidental
or
intentional
and
to
that
stumes
replies
accidental,
according
to
the
testimony.
the
way
i
see
this
situation,
when
the
police
had
that,
in
effect,
they
had
their
case.
they
had
gotten
the
man
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
lied
in
his
previous
answers.
they
now
had
him
admitting
that
he
was
there.
they
got
him
admitting
involvement
in
the
death.
yes,
he
is
claiming
that
it
is
accidental.
but,
they
knew
that
the
facts,
the
physical
facts,
belied
any
claim
that
the
death
was
accidental.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
am
not
positive
that
i
follow
that
question.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
yes.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
according
to
the
record,
not
at
that
particular
point
in
time.
i
think
the
record
does
show
that
the
detectives
started
the
long
trip
with
fresh
miranda
warnings,
that
they
immediately
interrogated,
and
that
the
record
indicates
that
the
interrogation
continued
intermittently
during
the
long
trip.
but,
it
is
true,
i
don't
believe,
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
there
was
an
outstanding
question
regarding
the
interrogation
at
the
time
that
mr.
stumes
made
that--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--the
approach
that
we
take
on
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
the
jury
ought
not
to
have
known
of
the...
i
will
use
your
terminology...
the
spontaneous
declaration
that
was
made
as
the
neared
sioux
falls,
because,
of
course,
it
is
our
theory
of
this
case
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
repeated
efforts
by
the
police
to
interrogate
absent
counsel,
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
authorities'
interrogation
the
afternoon
before
without
even
benefit
of
miranda,
that
we
would
never
have
reached
the
point
where
we
could
have
this
spontaneous
declaration,
again,
to
use
your
terms,
mr.
chief
justice,
occur.
so,
we
really
fashion
an
argument,
i
think,
that
builds
one
step
at
a
time
to
reach
that
final
conclusion.
incidentally--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
can
see
the
problem
that
you
would
have
with
that.
insofar
as
whether
either
of
the
courts
below
made
findings
on
that
specific
issue,
i
don't
think
directly
that
i
can
recall...
the
district
court,
as
i
indicated,
found
the
interrogation
in
the
afternoon
to
have
violated
the
principles
of
miranda,
but
had,
for
reasons
that
i
never
have
been
able
to
understand,
held
that
that
was
harmless.
i
have
to
analogize
or
contrast
that,
i
should
say,
to
what
the
eighth
circuit
did
when
they
looked
at
this
case.
the
eighth
circuit
looked
not
only
at
the
interrogation
in
the
automobile,
but
they
also
looked
at
the
statements
attributed
to
mr.
stumes
upon
arriving
at
the
jail
in
sioux
falls.
counsel
for
the
state
has
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
according
to
the
detective's
testimony
mr.
stumes
asked
the
detective
to
come
back
and
it
is
then
that
he
is
supposed
to
have
said,
tell
them
i
am
not
a
vicious
killer.
i
believe
the
eighth
circuit
took
the
view,
for
instance,
looking
at
that--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--that
is
the
other
one
you
were
trying
to
get
at.
i
couldn't
recall
it
either.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
okay.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
then,
justice
rehnquist,
was
that
just
as
the
eighth
circuit
saw
that
final
incriminating
statement
as
having
flowed
from
the
interrogation
in
the
car,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
presume
that--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--it
is
my
understanding
that
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
the
interrogation
which
took
place
in
the
car
violated--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--interrogation
took
place
in
the
car
intermittently
throughout
the
day
according
to
the
record.
it
was
intensive
at
the
beginning
according
to
the
record.
then,
from
that
point
forward,
maybe
half
an
hour
into
the
trip,
according
to
the
record
it
is
intermittent.
now,
i
realize
that
is
perhaps
not
the
clearest
record
we
would
like
to
have,
but
that
is
what
we
have
as
a
record,
intermittent
questioning.
then
mr.
stumes
is
alleged
to
have
said
taking
a
human
life
is
so
useless
or
words
to
that
effect.
immediately
that
was
followed
by
interrogation.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
would
contend
otherwise.
there
was
vigorous
interrogation
that
then
took
place.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
have
difficulty
accepting
the
terminology
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky,
because
i
think
this
entire
episode
needs
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
what
it
really
was.
i
think
the
whole
scenario
was
an
effort
to
elicit
incriminating
statements
and
it
lasted
not
just
a
few
minutes,
but
it
lasted
really
a
day
and
a
half.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
the
first
half
hour
in
the
automobile
under
all
of
those
various
facts
that
you
would
suggest
or
assumptions,
i
would
say,
yes.
but,
of
course--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--all
right.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
i
don't
agree,
because
the
first
day
ended
with
a
third
request
for
counsel
made
that
same
day.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
at
the
end
of
the
second
interrogation
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
first
day.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
this
is
the
interrogation
that
had
no
miranda
rights.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
that
one
concludes
with
a
very
clear
request.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
you
will
recall
we
mentioned
earlier
that
according
to
the
evidence
mr.
stumes
is
alleged
to
have
said
that
the
death
was
accidental.
he
then
goes
on
to
indicate
that
he
is
not
going
to
talk
about
it
any
more
until
he
sees
steve,
his
attorney.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
think
i
have.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
i
may
run
into
trouble
with
you,
mr.
justice,
or
perhaps
one
of
your
colleagues
making
a
distinction
between--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--pardon
me.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
the
problem
i
was
having
was
between
dicta
and
holding
and
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
tell
you
or
that
i
can
refer
to
a
holding
if
you
wish
to
use
that
particular
term.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
well,
certainly.
edwards,
of
course--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--yes.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
miranda.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
that
is
the
key.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
think
miranda...
my
whole
theory
has
been
that
we
need
never
get
to
edwards
because
miranda
says
when
counsel
is
requested,
the
police
officers
must
stop
questioning.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
they
even
went
on
in
miranda
to
explain
what
the
alternatives
are
that
are
available
to
the
police.
they
say
in
miranda
you
don't
need
to
have
a
jailhouse
lawyer
available
or
a
policehouse
lawyer
available
because
you
can
make
a
decision
that
you
are
not
going
to
get
an
attorney
there
right
away,
but
just
remember
you
can't
interrogate
until
you
do
it.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
miranda
still
permits
a
waiver,
but
i
see
miranda
as
saying
really...
i
think
there
are
two
kinds
of
waivers
or
a
waiver
at
two
levels
that
can
take
place.
when
a
suspect
is
advised
of
his
rights,
you
have
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
present,
the
suspect
can
at
that
time
make
a
knowing,
intelligent,
voluntary
waiver
of
that
right
and
say,
no,
i
don't
want
an
attorney,
i
will
talk
to
you.
that
is
a
waiver.
you
get
a
different
waiver
question,
i
really
think,
when
that
suspect
has
said
i
need
my
attorney.
then
he
has,
in
effect,
said
i
can't
deal
with
you
without
help.
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
i
think
that
miranda
does,
but
i
don't
think
i
can
say
that
it
is
holding
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word.
but,
i
think
clearly--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--well,
i--
mr.
timothy
j.
mc
greevy
--i
am
not
sure
how
to
respond
to
that.
the
point
that
i
wish
to
make
with
respect
to
miranda
is
that...
and
i
need
to
address
just
for
a
moment
the
retroactivity
question
if
we
ever
reach
that,
if
the
court
reaches
that
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
view
edwards
as
establishing
a
new
principle,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
was
abundantly
foreshadowed
by
miranda,
because
miranda
said
when
they
ask
for
counsel
you
quit
questioning.
and,
i
think
all
edwards
did
was
reinforce
that,
give
life
to
it,
give
vitality
to
it,
and
tell
the
authorities
that
you
will
abide,
you
will
abide
by
that
request.
so,
that
is
the
way
i
view
it.
by
way
of
conclusion,
we
do
respectfully
request
on
behalf
of
our
client
that
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
matter
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
concluded
my
argument.
thank
you.
