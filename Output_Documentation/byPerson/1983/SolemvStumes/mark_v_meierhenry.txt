mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
the
court
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
under
the
case
of
edward
versus
arizona,
in
a
case
collaterally
attacking
the
conviction
of
mr.
stumes,
reversed
the
district
court.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
edward
versus
arizona
will
be
applied
retroactively
to
the
case
of
mr.
stumes
when
that
attack
was
made
by
a
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
facts
essentially
on
this
case
is
in
1973
norman
stumes
killed
a
young
lady
in
sioux
falls,
south
dakota.
this
occurred
on
september
17,
1973.
ten
days
later
he
was
arrested
in
green
bay,
wisconsin,
on
other
charges
that
had
been
pending,
not
on
what
were
originally
filed
as
murder
charges,
but
on
perjury
charges
and
other
charges
at
that
time.
during
the
time
that
the
authorities
were
seeking
him
for
questioning
concerning
the
death
of
miss
hoff,
his
mother
hired
an
attorney
for
him.
and,
his
attorney
had
a
conversation
with
the
law
enforcement
officers
in
sioux
falls,
south
dakota,
and
that
lawyer
advised
the
law
enforcement
officers
that
if
he
got
a
hold
of
mr.
stumes
first,
he
would
tell
him
to
turn
himself
in
for
questioning.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
authorities
found
him
first
and
arrested
him
first,
that
they
would
not
question
him
until
the
attorney,
mr.
jorgensen,
was
notified,
and
that
was
done.
mr.
jorgensen
was
notified
some
time
on
the
27th
of
october
1973...
or
the
27th
of
september
1973
that
mr.
stumes
had
been
arrested
over
in
green
bay.
mr.
jorgensen
then,
either
on
the
28th
or
the
29th
of
september
in
1973,
called
norman
stumes
and
told
him
not
to
talk
to
anybody
until
he
was
brought
back
to
south
dakota,
to
exercise
his
right
to
speak
with
no
one.
upon
being
arrested
by
the
green
bay
authorities,
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights
which
were
required
in
1973
and
he
made
no
statements
at
that
time.
later
on
two
police
officers,
as
well
as
a
deputy
sheriff
from
south
dakota,
went
to
green
bay
to
transport
him
back
and
they
arrived
there
on
october
1st.
they
met
with
mr.
stumes
in
wisconsin,
brown
county,
wisconsin
jail
at
which
time
mr.
stumes
gave
them
voluntary
permission
to
search
where
he
had
been
arrested,
the
place
where
he
had
been
arrested
and
his
automobile.
he
was
also
given
miranda
warnings
at
that
time
by
the
south
dakota
authorities
and
a
conversation
ensued
for
about
an
hour
and
45
minutes
of
which
nothing
incriminating
came
out
of
that.
later
that
afternoon
there
was
another
conversation
between
the
defendant
and
the
authorities.
he
was
not
given
his
miranda
rights.
the
record
is
clear.
and,
the
only,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
the
only
true
incriminating
thing
is
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
intercourse
with
the
dead
girl
on
the
day
in
question
and
he
also,
in
answer
to
a
question
posed
to
him,
was
this
death
accidental,
he
answered
that
it
was.
of
course,
he
was
going
to
be
brought
back
to
south
dakota
on
these
other
charges,
not
the
murder
charges,
and
so
on
october
2nd,
they
proceeded
to
get
an
in
automobile
and
drive
the
500
miles
from
green
bay,
wisconsin,
back
to
sioux
falls,
south
dakota.
when
they
got
in
the
car,
he
was
once
again
given
his
miranda
warnings.
and,
a
conversation
about
the
case,
about
the
murder
part
of
the
case,
took
place
for
20
or
30
minutes.
they
left
about
9:00
in
the
morning
from
green
bay,
drove
in
a
westerly
direction
towards
sioux
falls,
south
dakota,
arrived
back
in
sioux
falls,
south
dakota
about
6:45
in
the
evening.
but,
about
90
miles
from
sioux
falls,
norman
stumes,
and
i
will
take
his
words,
said...
norman
stumes,
in
testifying
at
various
hearings,
said,
"i
had
a
little
conflict
with
my
emotions.
"
and
he
began
to
sob
and
he
made
the
statement
to
the
effect,
i
don't
understand
why
anybody
would
want
to
kill
a
young
girl
like
joyce.
and,
detective
green,
an
officer
of
the
state
of
south
dakota,
said,
norman,
it
probably...
why
don't
you
get
it
off
your
chest,
at
which
time
he
made
admissions
that
implicated
him
and
were
used
against
him
at
his
trial.
and,
stumes
also
said
at
that
time,
according
to
detective
green,
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
somebody
about
this
but
i
didn't
know
how
to
do
it
or
who
to
talk
to.
this
conversation
took
place
approximately
90
miles
from
sioux
falls,
and
although
the
record
is
not
clear,
about
5:00
in
the
afternoon.
throughout
that
time,
from
9:00
to
9:30,
throughout
the
day,
norman
stumes
himself
says
he
was
not
interrogated,
that
there
was
general
conversation
about
the
green
bay
packers,
automobile
racing,
and
other
such
things.
just
prior
to
his
starting
to
sob
and
make
these
statements...
he
describes
the
situation,
the
defendant
does,
like
this:
that
there
had
been
no
conversation
in
the
car
for
10
or
15
minutes.
officer
skadsen,
who
was
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
this
automobile,
was
almost
alseep,
he
was
nodding
off.
the
other
gentleman
was
driving.
detective
green
was
looking
out
of
the
window
somewhat
bored.
that
is
when
he
had
his
conflict
with
his
emotions,
began
with
the
statement,
why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
joyce,
began
to
sob.
the
officer
said,
norman,
get
it
off
your
chest,
at
which
time
he
made
the
statement.
once
they
returned
back
to
south
dakota,
he
was
placed
in
the
jail.
the
officers
broke
off
all
contact
with
him.
they
went
to
another
part.
he
sent
word
out
through
a
jailer,
called
detective
skadsen
back
into
the
jail
area,
and
said
to
officer
skadsen,
please
tell
them
that
i
am
not
a
vicious
killer,
that
i
didn't
mean
to
do
it.
the
eighth
circuit
held
edwards
to
be
retroactive
and
held
that
in--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--officer
skadsen
came
back
into
the
jail
area.
norman
stumes
came
out
to
him--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--the
officer
said
basically
what
did
you
want,
norman,
or...
i
can't
recall
the
exact
words,
justice,
but
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
said
to
skadsen,
officer
skadsen,
he
said
tell
them
that
i
am
not
a
vicious
killer.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
then--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
other
than
he
was
not
a
vicious
killer
and
he
wanted
officer
skadsen
to
tell
others
that
he
was
not
a
vicious
killer.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
a
description
of
his
statements
prior
to
that.
the
only
truly
incriminating
statements
took
place
in
the
automobile
and
also
later.
the
threshold--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--at
the
jail,
the
one
we
just
alluded
to.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
only
one
from
the
prior
day
of
october
1st
in
the
afternoon
was
he
admitted
that
he
had
intercourse
and
when
asked
the
question,
what
kind
of
death
was
this,
was
it
accidental?
he
said
it
was
accidental.
that
was
admitted
as
well
as
the
conversation
in
general
that
i
have
alluded
to
in
the
automobile
at
approximately
5:00,
based
on
driving
times
in
the
afternoon,
and
then
the
one
back
at
the
jail
after
he
had
been
lodged
into
jail
on
these
other
charges.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
first
of
all,
it
is
two
parts.
first
of
all,
this
court
will
should
agree,
i
guess
you
would
say,
to
apply
the
retroactive
effect.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
don't
think
we
get
to
that
unless
this
court
decides
to
apply
edwards
retroactively,
which,
of
course,
we
would
say
this
is
like
miranda
and
the
many
other
cases
this
court
has
not
applied
retroactively,
shouldn't
be
applied
retroactively,
because
the
court
has
indicated
to
those
of
us
whose
duty
it
is
to
educate
the
law
enforcement
officers...
at
least
in
my
state
it
falls
upon
the
attorney
general,
and
when
this
court
makes
a
rule
like
edwards,
a
new
rule,
one
that
we
were
not
used
to,
certain
things
go
into
operation.
as
the
attorney
general,
my
duty
is
to
train
all
the
law
enforcement
officers
as
well
as
to
supervise
prosecutors.
so,
when
this
court...
within
days
after
this
court
makes
a
new
rule
like
edwards,
we
immediately
send
out
in
police
parlance,
you
might
say,
what
can
occur
and
what
cannot
occur
throughout
our
state
and
that
is
done
on
almost
an
emergency
basis,
because
there
is
no
reason
to
start
a
case
and
not
follow
the
proper
procedures.
so,
with
that
in
mind,
we
have
to
decide
whether
this
case
should
be
retroactively
applied
as
the
eighth
circuit
did,
and,
of
course,
as
indicated
in
the
palteire
case,
this
is
not
an
appropriate
type
of
case
for
retroactive
effect.
it
does
not
assist
in
any
way
the
truth-finding
portion
of
the
trial.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
follow
what
the
eighth
circuit
has
said,
and
we
go
back
and
retry
norman
stumes,
the
truthful
statements
that
he
made
to
law
enforcement
officers
will
be
suppressed
by
the
exclusionary
rule,
whereas,
those
matters
found
to
be
untruthful,
his
version
of
what
happened
that
day,
and
his
attempt,
testifying
under
oath
before
a
jury
to
escape
the
culpability
that
he
had
admitted
to
prior,
will
be
allowed
in.
in
other
words,
we
will
have
decided
a
case,
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
retroactively,
take
the
truth
out
of
the
case,
and
leave
the
defendant--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
justice,
but
i
can't
imagine
a
competent
defense
attorney
would
ever
put
him
on
the
stand.
i
mean,
from
a
practical
viewpoint,
it
wouldn't
occur.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
right.
and,
of
course,
if
you
look
at
this
case,
and
i
will
not
make
any
admissions
as
to
what
would
occur
later
except
that
we
are
obviously
committed
to
reprosecute
if
the
eighth
circuit
is
confirmed,
but
this
is
ten
years
ago.
officer
green
is
dead.
there
is
obviously
a
different
approach
as
to
the
evidence
we
will
have
to
present
at
the
second
trial
from
the
first.
the
removing
of
his
admissions
and
confessions
in
most
of
these
types
of
cases
where
the
admission
or
confession
occurred
early
on
effectively
denies
the
public
the
right
to
have
a
trial
on
this
issue.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
the
law
in
1973,
when
norman
stumes
went
to
trial,
and
when
the
circuit
judge
of
our
state
first
ruled
on
his
admissibility
or
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
so
having
had
that
direct
part
of
the
case
over,
we
do
not
have
at
this
time
the
resources
to
keep
ten
years
of
evidence
for
every
criminal
case
tried
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
which
the
eighth
circuit
seems
to
be
saying
to
us
that
we
must
do.
we
must
wait
in
case
there
is
a
retroactive
application
of
a
case
like
edwards.
are
we
going
to
build
mammoth
evidence
lockers
in
our
state
to
keep
the
evidence
of
each
and
every
case
with
the
chance
that
it
could
be
applied
retroactively,
because
the
state
most
certainly
does
not
want
norman
stumes
just
turned
free.
we
would
have
to
make
an
attempt
to
retry
him
for
the
vicious
killing
that
he
really
has
never
made
any
claim
throughout
the
appeal
that
he
didn't
do.
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
this
man
killed
a
young
girl
for
no
reason
in
sioux
falls,
south
dakota.
the
question
is
whether
we
make
a
retroactive
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
this
court
has
said
in
different
decisions
is
a
rule
to
prevent,
to
deter
those
of
us
in
law
enforcement
in
the
future,
but
in
this
case
it
will
most
certainly
not
do
that.
the
day
edwards
was
decided
and
we
got
word
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
law
enforcement
changed.
we
did
it
on
an
emergency
basis,
because
the
edwards
case--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
the
way
we
put
it
out
to
our
prosecutors
and
our
law
enforcement
officers
is
in
the
context
that
it
basically
added
another
element
of
proof
to
any
case
where
someone
confesses
or
makes
admissions.
and,
i
know...
i
am
going
to
answer
your
question
not
according
to
what
the
court
has
described
it,
but
the
way
we
described
it
to
the
cop
on
the
street
that
has
to
do
this
the
day
after
your
decision
in
edwards.
we
said
it
is
like
another
element
of
proof.
it
has
totally
changed
the
way
we
did
it
under
miranda.
therefore,
it
is
up
to
us
to
prove
that
the
individual,
once
he
has
made
a
claim
to
remain
silent
or
for
a
lawyer,
we
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
not
only
did
he
waive
that
right,
that
he
did
so
willingly
and
he
came
to
you.
so,
what
we
told
our
officers
is
that
is
a
very
important...
we
can't
even
get
to
trial
or
we
will
never
be
able
to
use
it
unless
you
can
prove
that
it
was
a
knowing,
willing
situation.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
we
told
them,
just
as
the
district
court
judge,
judge
nichol
found
in
this
case,
to
scrupulously
observe,
as
was
done
in
this
case,
that
if
he
wants
to
talk
to
a
lawyer,
you
cease
questioning
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
and,
on
two
occasions
in
this
very
case,
that
was
done.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
state
of
south
dakota
did
not.
we
were
not
aware
that
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court
said
that
you
can
never
talk
to
a
criminal
defendant
again.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
first--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
think
that
was
his
right
to
exercise.
he
had
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
exercise
that
right.
but,
again--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
they
could
go
back
and
inquire
if
he
wished
to
talk.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
they
could--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
if
he
willingly
did
so.
miranda
appeared
to
indicate
to
the
average
policeman
that
those
rights
are
to
be
scrupulously
observed.
and,
if
the
individual
says
i
want
to
talk
to
my
lawyer...
let's
take
our
case.
he
freely
talked
to
the
authorities.
so,
it
isn't
a
question...
he
talked
to
them
and
at
the
point
he
said,
when
he
was
asked
if
he
would
take
a
polygraph,
because
others
had
taken
a
polygraph,
he
had
made
no
admissions
at
this
point.
he
said
i
think
i
want
to
talk
to
steve
before
i
do
that.
steve,
referring
to
steve
jergensen,
his
lawyer
back
in
sioux
falls,
at
which
time
the
questioning
stopped.
now,
they
knew
he
had
talked
to
him
on
the
telephone.
he
was
probably
never
prevented,
although
the
record
would
not
reflect
that,
from
making
a
telephone
call.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
is
no
longer.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
it
wasn't
my
office,
but
the
policy
was...
i
was
a
defense
lawyer
at
that
time...
that
if
he
was
given
his
miranda
warnings,
he
knew
them,
he
understood
them,
and
he
chose
to
speak,
he
could
do
that.
he
said,
i
don't
want
to
talk
any
more--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--at
that
time,
when
stumes
was
there,
i
was
defending
stumes,
not
prosecuting
him.
i
can't
speak
what
the
rules
were
prior
to
1978.
what
we
are
saying
is--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
i
am
not
saying
i
don't
know
what
the
rules
were
before.
i
am
saying
i
don't
know
what
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
had
decreed.
i
know
what
the
law
was
and
the
law
allowed
authorities
to
not
reinterrogate,
but
to
go
back
and
question
whether
he
wished
to
talk
some
more.
this
was
nothing
like
in
edwards
where
he
was
told
he
had
to
talk.
you
have
in
this
case--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
don't
think
miranda
teaches
that,
but
miranda--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--miranda
teaches
that...
when
you
say
go
back
over
and
over,
there
is
the
illusion
that
there
is
an
oppressiveness
about
this
whole
conversation
and
i
would
submit
from
the
standpoint
of
every
state
in
the
union
that
if
an
individual
says
he
doesn't
want
to
talk,
he
should
not
be
pressured
into
talking.
that
does
not
stop
the
authorities
from
going
in
an
seeing
if
he
now
wishes
to
discuss
this
matter,
because--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
again,
it
is
a
matter
of
degree.
as
you
looked
at
in
some
of
the
progency
of
miranda.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no.
i
think
i
would
have
to
explain
to
you
about
south
dakota.
first
of
all,
we
are
one
of
the
few--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
it
does,
but
to
transport
a
prisoner
today
on
commercial
airlines
is
very
difficult.
it
is
not
done
very
often,
number
one.
it
wasn't
done
in
'73.
you
can't
wear
a
gun
on
an
airliner,
you
can't
use
handcuffs
on
an
airliner,
on
and
on
and
on.
so,
the
normal
way
of
doing
things
in
the
midwest
is
to
drive
and
get
them.
secondly,
that
there
is
cost.
that
would
be
changed
today
because
we
have
purchased
our
own
airplane,
but
it
was
the
normal
course
of
transportation,
not
only
in
south
dakota,
but
throughout
the
midwest.
to
drive
over
to
green
bay,
which
is
only
500
miles...
in
south
dakota,
we
go
170
miles
to
go
to
district
court.
it
is
not
even
unusual.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
or
to
lunch,
yes.
[laughter]
there
are
cases
that
we
have
tried
and
we
don't
even
have
a
restaurant
in
the
town
we
have
tried
the
case
in.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
but,
it
is
not
unusual.
in
fact,
until
the--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
i
think
judge
nichol,
who
is
a
good
jurist
in
our
state,
he
found
that
that
is
not
unusual.
first
of
all,
they
talked
about
the
green
bay
packers
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
crime.
they
talked
about
racing.
this
is
normal
to
spend
great
hours
of
time
in
automobiles
where
we
come
from.
it
is
not
unusual
at
all.
and,
besides
that,
you
are
talking
about
an
individual
here
that
willingly
talked
at
every
stage
which
miranda
never
stopped
us
from
listening
to
people
who
wanted
to
tell
us
they
killed
others.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
that
was--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.
if
you
go
back
through
the
records
of
state
court
trials
in
south
dakota,
you
will
find
people
that
are
simply
witnesses,
police
officers
given
the
miranda
warnings
because
they
don't
want
to
make
a
mistake.
they
don't
want
to
go
too
far.
they
don't
want
to
arrest
a
person,
convict
them,
and
then
at
a
later
date
have
him
let
go
on
appeal
because
of
their
mistake,
because
they
didn't
give
a
miranda
warning
when
they
should,
because
they
didn't
figure
out
who
initiated
it,
which
is
the
new
edwards
rule,
which,
to
us,
is
absolutely
new,
not
an
extension
of
miranda,
adds
an
element
of
proof.
if
we
are
to
sustain
a
conviction,
we
must
prove
that
if
he
confesses
as
stumes
did
here.
there
is
no
question
about
this
man's
guilt.
it
is
a
question
of
procedure
of
retroactive
application
of
a
rule.
and,
when
a
case
like
edwards
comes
down,
i
have
learned
as
attorney
general,
we
must
immediately
put
it
into
effect,
otherwise
we
will
be
right
back
here
or
my
predecessor
will,
eight
or
ten
years,
not
arguing
about
the
guilt,
not
arguing
about
the
trial
being
fair,
arguing
about
who
initiated
the
statements
that
lead
to
the
confession.
we
think
that
this
case
is
just
like...
not
just
like,
very
similar
to
oregon
versus
bradshaw
in
the
sense
that
in
that
case
a
majority
of
this
court
held
that
first
we
have
to
see
who
initiated
the
conversation
and
then,
secondly,
we
have
to
show
by
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
it
was
a
willing
and
knowing
waiver.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
himself
says
i
wasn't
being
interrogated,
there
was
just
some
conversation.
then
he
said,
and
this
was
immediately...
during
the
conversation
that
is
so
crucial,
he
said
i
had
to
tell
somebody,
i
had
to
get
it
out,
and
i
wanted
to
talk.
and,
i
see
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
prevents
an
individual
from
confessing
to
a
law
enforcement
officer.
that
is
what
happened
here.
and,
as
the
law
was
at
that
time,
under
miranda...
judge
nichol
ruled
under
miranda
all
of
this
was
proper,
all
of
this
was
admissible.
the
only
thing
that
the
eighth
circuit,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
the
times,
judge
nichol
refers
to
the
oral
argument
reported
in
law
week
of
the
edwards
case,
but
it
was
decided
after
judge
nichol
made
his
ruling
at
the
district
court
level
and
obviously
the
eighth
circuit
used
it
in
making
their
decision.
but,
the
eighth
circuit,
in
applying
the
retroactivity,
never
had
a
discussion
of
how
in
this
case
it
would
ever
help
the
truth-finding
process
to
make
it
retroactive.
miranda
itself
was
not
retroactive.
how
does
it
help
the
truth-finding
process
to
eliminate
truthful
statements
from
the
trial?
it
is
the
same
argument
we
made
to
this
court,
south
dakota
did
in
nebel.
how
does
it
ever
help
the
truth-finding
process
to
retroactively
exclude
the
truth?
now,
if
we...
i
will
assume
for
my
argument
that
we
agree
with
the
exclusionary
rule
as
authority
in
south
dakota.
once
the
rule
of
edwards
came
into
effect
may
18,
1981,
of
course,
we
must
scrupulously
follow
it,
as
we
followed
miranda
in
1973
in
mr.
stumes'
case,
because
if
we
have
the
right
person,
if
the
jury
finds
him
guilty,
we
want
it
to
be
upheld.
we
don't
want
to
lose
because
of
ignorance
or
misguided
statements
taken
from
other
people
or--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
have
not
referred
to
that
innis
case
or
others
because
of
the
one
question
from
the
court
already,
the
assumption
that
these
long
drives
in
automobiles
are
somehow
set
up.
you
know,
either
to
be
the
christian
burial
speech
or
the
innis
case
where
some
little
girl
would
be
injured
by
the
shotgun.
here
there
was
no
such
statement.
there
was
quiet.
we
have
a
nodding-off
police
officer,
one
looking
out
the
window,
and
the
other
one
driving.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
most
certainly
think
so.
to
refrain...
when
they
left
green
bay,
wisconsin,
there
was
testimony
about
the
death
of
joyce
hoff.
after
that,
it
became
an
automobile
trip
of
transporting
a
prisoner,
proper,
normal,
usual
under
all
of
our
practices.
they
stopped
for
lunch,
they
stopped
for
gasoline,
and
so
forth
along
the
way.
it
was
only
as
the
car
approached
sioux
falls,
some
60
to
90
miles
away,
that
he
blurted
out
or
he
began
to
blurt
out
what
had
occurred.
he
started
sobbing
out
of
the
blue,
no
conversation,
according
to
the
defendant
himself
for
10
or
15
minutes.
he
said,
i
don't
know
why
anyone
would
want
to
kill
joyce
hoff,
and
started
to
make
the
statements.
the
officer
said,
why
don't
you
get
it
off
your
chest?
and,
he
then
proceeded
to
do
so.
his
next
statement
was
i
have
been
wanting
to
tell
somebody
about
this.
that
is
a
knowing
waiver.
later
on
detective
green
said,
norman,
we
are
going
to
want
a
written
statement
when
you
get
back
and
your
lawyer
probably
won't
let
you
give
it.
and,
he
says,
in
effect,
i
don't
give
a
damn,
i
will
talk
to
anybody
i
want
to.
he
was
aware
of
his
rights.
he
was
aware
of
his
miranda
warnings.
and,
under
the
facts,
should
you
hold
this
to
be
retroactive,
which
we
most
certainly
don't
think
is
a
proper
case
at
all
for
retroactivity,
even
under
the
facts,
the
eighth
circuit
was
incorrect
in
holding
that
he
did
not
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waive
his
right
to
have
an
attorney
present.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
we
do.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
is
proper
for
me
to
argue.
that
was
one
of
our
questions
on
our
writ
of
cert.
it
was
not
granted.
but--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
think
that
the
district
court
is
the
proper
place
to
find
the
facts.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
if
that
is
your
understanding,
i
mistated
it.
i
said
after
he
was
put
in
the
car
he
was
questioned
for
20
or
30
minutes.
then
the
rest--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
it
went
over
the
same
subject
matters
that
they
had
discussed
the
prior
day
and
he
was
given
his
miranda
warnings.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
none
greater
than
he
had
the
prior
afternoon
when
he
admitted
to
having
intercourse
with
the
dead
girl
and
that
the
death
was
accidental.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
he
was
present,
yes,
which
is
obviously
an
incriminating
element.
i
have
tried
to
give
you--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
and,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
a
knowing,
voluntary
waiver
and
the
district
court
put
out
a
full
factor,
which
is
repeated
in
the
eighth
circuit's
decision.
this
was
an
experienced
criminal.
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
he
knew
fully
well
what
he
was
doing.
and,
i
say
in
many
cases
they
know
what
appellate
courts
will
be
looking
for
in
the
way
they
answer
questions.
we
would
urge
this
court...
and
have
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal...
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
and
simply
affirm
judge
nichol's
district
court
appeal
or
district
court
case
in
effect.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
very
briefly,
your
honor.
as
most
courts
are
wont
to
do,
most
of
the
argument
today
had
to
do
with
how
to
apply
edwards
retroactively
and,
of
course,
it
is
our
strenuous
objection,
and
i
only
rise
to
remind
the
court
that
under
the
prior
rules
and
teachings
of
this
court
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
apply
retroactively.
and,
if
it
is
not
a
proper
case
and
you
agree
with
the
state,
then
obviously
the
eighth
circuit
must
be
reversed
because
it
most
certainly
was
proper
under
miranda
and
any
other
case
until
the
new
edwards
rule
was
adopted
in
1981.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
believe
it
is
a
new
rule.
i
know
we--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
believe
it
did.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
believe
since
then
that
other
members
of
the
court
have
looked
at
it...
not
of
this
court
but
of
other
courts
have
looked
at
it
as
a
new
per
se
rule.
it
was
certainly
a
new
rule
as
far
as
those
of
us
who
must
implement
the
decisions
are
concerned,
absolutely
new,
and,
therefore,
i
think
it
is
a
new
rule
and
it
should
be
given
retroactive
effect,
because
if
it
is
not
a
new
rule,
then
nothing
should
be
reversed
that
happened
in
1973.
thank
you
very
much.
