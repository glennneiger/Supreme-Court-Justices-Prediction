unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--before
you
begin,
respondent's
brief
has
this
statement.
"contrary
to
the
government's
characterization
of
the
decision
below
as
extending
the
exclusionary
rule
to
an
entirely
new
category
of
cases
and
creating
a
new
barrier
to
enforcement
of
immigration
laws,
it
merely
marks
a
return
to
long-standing
former
practice.
"
"until
1979,
the
ins
performed
its
investigative
and
prosecutorial
functions
in
a
legal
regime
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
was
thought
to
apply.
"
it
then
goes
on
to
say
that
really
what
you
are
asking
is
abandonment
of
the
exclusionary
rule
after
over
60
years
of
applicability.
what
do
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
there
been
a
practice
for
60
years
of
recognizing
the
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
has
it
been
a
practice
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--in
deportation
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
situation
of
the
egregious
violation
that
might
constitute
in
and
of
itself
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause?
now,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
adopted
a
different
view
as
to--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree
with
that?
is
that
required
in
your
view
in
a
purely
civil
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
your
position?
is
it
constitutionally
required
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
courts?
do
you
think
as
a
matter
of
deterrence,
although
not
constitutionally
required,
that
in
the
egregious
situation,
where
there
is
a
violation
of
due
process
that
the
rule
should
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
cut
the
other
way?
i
am
just
not
sure.
if
there
has
never
been
a
problem,
and
if
the
rule
has
been
routinely
enforced,
maybe
there
isn't
just
a
big
problem.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
standard
text
on
immigration
law
say
it
applied?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
a
brand
new
immigration
lawyer
and
you
went
to
that
text,
i
suppose
you
would
assume
it
applied,
i
guess,
is
all
i
am
saying.
unknown
speaker
there
are
no
statistics
as
to
how
many
cases
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
denied?
unknown
speaker
where
they
held...
yes.
unknown
speaker
weren't
most
of
them,
didn't
they
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
didn't
apply,
so
you
didn't
get
to
the
exclusion.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
exclusion.
i
said
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
deny
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated,
you
will
never
get
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
not
that
many
on
immigration.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
in
particular,
there
is
no
positive
evidence
of
what
this
man
said.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
normal
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
which
is
a
fourth
amendment
point.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
about
his
fourth
amendment
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
difficulty
in
getting
through
the
smoke.
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
bia
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
can
see
how
that
would
prove
one
aspect
of
what
you
are
talking
about,
but
are
there
bia
opinions,
for
instance,
that
discuss
on
the
merits
a
claim
of--
unknown
speaker
--how
many
opinions
does
the
bia
write
in
an
average
year?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
what
percentage
of
those
opinions
deal
with
fourth
amendment
issues?
unknown
speaker
is
that
typically
true,
that
the
only
evidence
you
have
of
alienage
is
their
own
admission?
unknown
speaker
by
another
alien.
unknown
speaker
by
another
alien.
unknown
speaker
we
have
had
several
cases
here
on
that.
unknown
speaker
didn't
we
have
a
case
last
year
where
they
kept
those
that
testified
for
the
government
and
sent
the
other
witnesses
back?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
there
are
70,000?
i
thought
there
were
a
million
a
year.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
the
930,000?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
can
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
i
don't
mean
to
take
up
too
much
of
your
time.
it
is
the
same
problem
i
think
may
have
troubled
justice
o'connor
earlier.
you
talk
about
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
it
seems
to
me
that...
mapp
against
ohio
is
what
raised
this
question
in
my
mind...
that
one
at
least
theoretically
might
say,
say
a
coerced
confession
case
might
be
different
from
the
search
of
a
home,
which
in
turn
might
be
different
from
just
an
arrest.
are
you
just
talking
about
arrest
cases,
or
are
you
talking
about
no
matter
what
the
ins
does
to
get
evidence,
no
exclusionary
rule
would
ever
apply?
unknown
speaker
what
about,
say,
the
search
of
a
home
without
a
warrant,
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sure
it
doesn't
happen
very
often.
i
am
just
trying
to
get
to
really
what
your
are
asking
us
to
do.
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
is
to
all
fourth
amendment,
but
you
don't
reach
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
at
a
deportation
hearing?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought...
didn't
the...
the
brandeis
opinion--
unknown
speaker
--held
it
was
applicable
to
bankruptcy
a
long
time
ago.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
privilege
against
testifying,
not
against
being
called
as
a
witness.
unknown
speaker
but
your
proposition
doesn't
affect
the
criminal
deportation
hearing?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
go
that
far?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
can
argue
that
point
just
the
opposite,
too,
and
say
that
because
it
is
a
single
federal
agency,
it
has
a
good
deal
more
power
and
ability
to
conform
the
conduct
of
its
agents
to
fourth
amendment
decisions,
whereas
all
the
countless
local
and
state
jurisdictions
simply
that
are
too
scattered
and
too
poor--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
how
rigid
is
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
proceeding
on
the
fourth
amendment
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
the
mere
absence
of
a
warrant
in
an
arrest
of
this
kind
of
case
wouldn't
put
the
burden
on
the
agent
to
defend
the
arrest,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
realize
in
the
criminal.
i
am
just
wondering
if
maybe
the
solution
to
your
problem
is
a
rule
that
requires
the
movant
to
bear
a
fairly
substantial
burden
of
proof.
unknown
speaker
well,
an
incredible
story
shouldn't
carry
a
burden
of
proof.
i
just
don't--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
what
would
happen
if
the
exclusionary
rule
were
applied
and
the
only
evidence
that
the
government
had
on
the
deportation
was
the
alien's
own
admission,
so
the
deportation
proceeding
resulted
in
the
release
of
the
individual
who
had
been
questioned.
now,
does
that
mean
that
the
alien
who
has,
of
course,
admitted
he
is
not
properly
here
can
just
remain
indefinitely
in
this
country?
what,
as
a
practical
matter,
does
the
government
then
do?
unknown
speaker
so
you
get
a
special
class
of
illegal
aliens.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
faced
with
the
application
of
an
illegal
fruits
of
the
evidence
doctrine
in
trying
to
follow
up
on
the
individual
later?
unknown
speaker
how
widespread
was
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey
takes
very
vigorous
issue
with
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
are
they
cited?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
bia
do
that,
what
you
just
referred
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
bad?
unknown
speaker
if
people
opt
for
voluntary
deportation
when
they
admit
that
they
have
illegally
entered
the
country?
unknown
speaker
since
you
analogize
this...
you
seem
to
think
a
deportation
proceeding
equates
to
a
criminal
proceeding,
is
that
voluntary
deportation
somewhat
analogous
to
a
guilty
plea
in
a
criminal
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question?
you
are
talking
about
deterrence.
it
seems
to
me
just
as
i
listen
to
you
that
given
the
large
number
of
citizens
who
are
perhaps
going
to
be
victimized
if
there
are
a
lot
of
fourth
amendment
violations,
this
might
be
an
area
in
which
the
civil
damage
remedy
might
actually
be
effective,
because
if
you
have
an
illegal
arrest
of
a
person
just
because
he
looked
hispanic
or
something
like
that
would
seem
like
one
of
the
simplest
cases
to
win
from
a
damage
point
of
view.
unknown
speaker
but
the
reason...
the
difference
that
occurs
to
me
as
i
listen
to
your
argument
is
that
you
have
a
large
number
of
potential
plaintiffs
out
there
in
this
particular
area
that
you
may
not
have
in
the
other
areas,
because
you
are
talking
about
arresting
the
wrong
person
basically.
unknown
speaker
ms.
heen,
in
your
brief,
at
footnote
9
on
page
30,
you
refer
to
the
fact
that
patterns
of
ins
conduct
described
and
reported
in
cases
evidence
widespread
fourth
amendment
violations
by
immigration
officers.
then
you
cite
ins
versus
delgado,
which
of
course
was
reversed
by
us
yesterday;
immigration
council
versus
piliot,
which
i
don't
believe
can
be
the
law
any
more
after
delgado.
are
these
the
theme
of
all
your
citations?
are
they
pretty
well
overruled
by
our
decision
yesterday?
unknown
speaker
such
as?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
ms.
heen?
one
of
their
arguments
is
not
just
how
it
works
in
a
particular
case,
but
rather
that
if
we
decide
the
way
you
urge
us
to,
that
there
will
be
an
opinion
on
the
books
that
will
stimulate
a
large
number
of
motions
that
have
not
been
filed
in
the
past,
and
both
in
the
70,000
contested
cases
and
in
the
900,000
uncontested
cases
there
will
be
a
very
great
practical
change
in
the
way
these
matters
are
handled.
would
you
like
to
comment
on
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
before
you
commence,
it
may
or
may
not
be
important,
but
i
am
not
clear
as
to
what
the
answer
is.
justice
brennan
asked
you
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
a
question
whether
or
not
the
statement
in
the
brief
of
respondents
was
correct
that
the
rule
had
been
enforced
consistently
for
many
years.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
decisions
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
counsel
for
respondents
say,
and
they
cite
pages
67-69
of
their
brief,
that
there
have
been
any
number
of
cases.
i
haven't
looked
at
those
cases.
maybe
i
misunderstood
either
or
both
of
you.
what
is
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
they
really
wouldn't
have
wasted
their
time
deciding
fourth
amendment
issues
in
a
case
if
the
evidence
was
admissible
anyway,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
actually
ruled
on
fourth
amendment
claims.
why
would
they
waste
their
time
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
correct
that
they
cite
some
cases
that
say
they
set
up
a
regular
procedure
for
processing,
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
they
didn't
have
lawyers?
