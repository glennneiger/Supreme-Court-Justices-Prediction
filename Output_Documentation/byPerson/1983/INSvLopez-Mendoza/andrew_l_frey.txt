mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
it
should
extend
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
heretofore
applied
by
it
only
in
the
context
of
criminal
prosecutions
and
quasi-criminal
forfeiture
proceedings
to
civil
deportation
hearings.
respondents
lopez
and
sandoval
are
mexican
nationals
who
entered
the
united
states
illegally
nearly
ten
years
ago.
each
was
apprehended
within
a
few
months
after
his
illegal
entry
by
an
ins
agent
at
his
place
of
employment,
and
each
made
admissions
of
his
illegal
alien
status
following
his
apprehension.
these
admissions
were
utilized
at
the
deportation
hearings
to
establish
that
respondents
were
not
u.s.
citizens,
a
fact
that
i
might
say
is
virtually
impossible
for
the
immigration
service
to
prove
by
other
means
in
cases
of
persons
who
enter
the
united
states
without
inspection,
and
these
admissions
formed
the
basis
of
the
decision
ordering
their
deportation.
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
an
en
banc
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
sandoval's
admission
of
his
alien
status
was
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
arrest.
as
to
respondent
lopez,
it
held
that
the
record
did
not
establish
whether
or
not
his
arrest
was
unlawful.
it
then
turned
to
the
question
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
deportation
hearings,
and
concluding
that
it
does,
reversed
the
order
of
deportation
with
respect
to
sandoval,
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
lopez.
now,
let
me
begin
my
discussion
by
saying--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
guess
i
have
two
things
to
say
about
that.
the
first
is
that
i
am
first
addressing
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
what
it
would
mean
in
terms
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
decide
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
applicable
to
deportation
proceedings,
and
as
to
that
point,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
would
be
an
extension
in
the
sense
that
the
court
has
never
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
to
civil
proceedings
of
any
kind,
and
it
has
never
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
non-punitive
proceeding
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
determine
status.
so,
from
the
standpoint
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
while
it
is
in
a
sense
a
question
of
semantics,
i
think
it
is
fair
for
us
to
characterize
a
decision
affirming
as
an
extension.
now,
there
is
a
second--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
a
point
that
i
intend
to
address.
i
do
not
think
it
has
been
a
practice.
it
has
not
been
in
any
way
a
significant
feature
of
deportation--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not
sure--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
not
sure
how
to
answer
that
question.
there
is
not
a
single
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
or
a
single
decision
of
a
federal
court
since
1920
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
evidence
should
be
suppressed
in
a
deportation
proceeding,
so
there
has
never
been
a
case
before
the...
there
is
only
one
case,
and
that
is
the
case
of
respondent
sandoval,
in
which
it
was
held
that
someone
should
not
be
deported
because
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
now,
it
is
true
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
courts,
the
bia,
at
least,
had
considered
the
question
whether
an
arrest
was
lawful,
whether
certain
evidence
was
lawfully
obtained.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
and
there
are
not
very
many
over
this
60-year
period,
it
was
either
determined
that
there
was
no
illegality
or
that
there
was
enough
other
evidence
of
deportability,
so
it
never
was
necessary
for
the
bia
actually
to
hold
yea
or
nay
as
to
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
was
applicable.
and
when
matter
of
sandoval,
which
is
the
1979
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
came
before
the
board,
the
board
concluded
four
to
one
that
this
was
effectively
a
question
of
first
impression
for
them,
and
that
they
were
free
to
make
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
not
bound
by
precedent.
there
was
one
dissenting
member
of
the
board
who
felt
it
had
been
the
practice.
now,
i
am
not
sure
what
to
make
of
it
from
the
standpoint
of
this
court,
except
i
think
it
is
quite
important
to
understand
that
if
this
court
decides
today
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
to
deportation
proceedings,
that
will
work
a
dramatic
change
in
the
nature
of
the
deportation
process
from
what
it
was
before.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
to
that
narrow
class
of
cases,
and
i
believe
there
are
two
instances
where
it
has
actually
found
that
evidence
should
be
suppressed
under
a
due
process
rationale.
this
is,
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
believe
it
has
done
it...
i
don't
believe
it
has
done
it
because
it
thought
it
constitutionally
required
it.
it
has
done
it
because
the
attorney
general
determined
on
reviewing
the
decision
in
matter
of
sandoval
that
it
should
be
done.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
my
position,
i
think,
would
be
that
it
is
not
constitutionally
required,
but
it
is
a
very
different
thing
to
say
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
its
discretion
should
determine
what
kind
of
evidence
it
will
receive
in
its
proceedings
for
the
courts
to
tell
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
what
kind
of
evidence
it
should
receive.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
are
talking
about
in
the
context
of
fourth
amendment,
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
egregious
violations?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
the
context
of
the
courts,
we
do
have
a
judicially
adopted
exclusionary
rule
which
does
require
the
exclusion
of
illegally
seized
evidence,
and
we
have
not
suggested
in
the
cases
that
the
court
has
previously
heard
that
it
should
modify
the
rule
so
far
as
to
allow
the
admission
of
such
evidence.
so,
in
the
context
of
criminal
prosecutions,
at
least,
it
is
not
our
position
that
this
evidence
should
be
deemed
admissible,
but
i
think
it
is
quite
a
different
question
as
to
when
the
courts
are
reviewing
the
decisions
of
the
agency.
i
think
it
would
be
tenable
perhaps
to
say
that
even
that
kind
of
evidence
is
admissible,
but
of
course
cases
like
verochin
against
california
suggested
even
before
mapp
that
there
was
a
restriction
on
the
use
of
such
evidence
in
criminal
prosecutions.
i
don't
know
if
i
have
fully
answered
your
question,
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
this
court's
own
jurisprudence,
the
only
holding
that
really
has
any
applicability
is
its
decision
in
janis,
united
states
against
janis,
and
while
that
case
clearly
imposes
substantial
restrictions
on
the
use
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
civil
proceedings,
we
concede
that
its
reasoning
does
not
foreclose
the
possible
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
certain
types
of
civil
cases.
now,
for
those
who
already
entertain
substantial
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
the
exclusionary
rule
and
its
existing
applications,
they
may
prefer
to
simply
draw
the
line,
and
to
resist
its
extension
to
entirely
new
contexts
such
as
non-punitive
civil
proceedings.
but
the
court
does
not
have
to
go
so
far
or
adopt
such
a
broad
rule
to
decide
this
case.
rather,
we
think
it
can
decide
this
case
by
employing
the
traditional
cost-benefit
analysis
that
it
has
used
in
deciding
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
connection
with
various
aspects
of
criminal
proceedings,
and
it
is
to
that
analysis
that
i
would
like
to
turn.
but
before
i
address
the
costs
and
benefits
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
deportation
proceedings,
i
think
it
is
useful
to
take
a
little
journey
through
the
looking
glass,
as
it
were,
to
the
imaginary
world
that
respondents
depict.
their
argument
here
rests
critically
on
the
following
series
of
assertions.
first,
that
there
has
long
been
and
continues
to
be
a
widespread
pattern
of
fourth
amendment
violations
by
ins
agents.
second,
that
there
has
long
existed
prior
to
the
bia's
decision
in
matter
of
sandoval
in
1979
a
meaningful
and
substantial
exclusionary
rule
remedy
in
deportation
proceedings.
third,
that
this
state
of
affairs
imposed
no
serious
burden
on
the
deportation
process
because
suppression
claims
were
infrequently
raised
and
even
more
rarely
successful.
fourth,
that
the
decision
in
matter
of
sandoval
created
a
situation
in
which
open
season
was
declared
on
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
hispanic
americans.
and
fifth,
that
only
a
restoration
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
deportation
proceedings
can
restore
those
rights.
now,
if
these
various
assertions
were
accurate,
a
case
could
be
made
for
respondent's
position,
but
they
are
fundamentally
inaccurate.
first,
as
the
court
of
appeals
itself
noted,
there
is
no
evidence
of
serious
or
widespread
fourth
amendment
violations
by
ins
agents.
now,
of
course,
there
are
bound
to
be
some.
they
make
over
a
million
arrests
a
year.
it
would
be
inconceivable
if
they
didn't
make
mistakes.
it
would
be
inconceivable
if
occasionally
they
didn't
detain
people
without
reasonable
suspicion
or
arrest
them
without
probable
cause.
but
what
is
so
striking
about
this
case
is
the
inability
of
anybody
to
point
to
any
substantial
evidence
of
a
serious
pattern
of
violations
by
immigration
agents.
secondly,
and
this
is
the
point
i
made
in
responding
to
justice
brennan's
question
before,
it
is
clear
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
never
been
a
meaningful
aspect
of
deportation
proceedings.
as
i
said,
there
is
not
a
single
case
since
1920
in
which
a
court
or
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
suppressed
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think
the
dilemma
is
not
ours
in
this
respect,
because
the
problem
that
we
are
concerned
about
is
not
so
much
that
the
occasional
illegal
alien
will
escape
deportation
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
the
systemic
consequences.
now,
what
happened,
i
think,
quite
clearly
prior
to
1979
is
that
there
was
no
general
understanding
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applied,
that
people
would
occasionally
raise
claims
that
dealt
with
the
legality--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
standard
text,
i
noticed
that
the
court
of
appeals
cites
the
1980
edition
of
the
standard
text,
which
says
it
applies.
matter
of
sandoval
was
decided
in
1979,
so
i
am
not
sure
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
a
text
that
says
it
applies.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
cannot
account
for
the
fact
that
people
never
made
suppression
motions
or
hardly
ever
did.
if
it
had
been
a
feature
of
the
deportation
process,
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
would
not
have
been,
as
there
are
in
criminal
cases--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--you
mean
how
many
cases--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
are
not
statistics
about
what
happened--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
that
is
not
true,
because
what
happens
is
that
there
is
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
following
which
there
is
a
right
of
judicial
review.
now,
you
can't
tell
me,
i
don't
think,
that
if
the
exclusionary
rule
was
such
a
regular
feature
of
the
deportation
process,
there
would
be
a
handful
of
cases
in
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
not
a
single
case
until
1970,
between
1920
and
1975.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
fourth
amendment
exclusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
the
alien
who
is
seeking
to
resist
deportation
gets
his
appeal
rights.
i
mean,
don't
you
see
cases
that
come
up
to
this
court
where
people
are
claiming
that
their
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated
in
criminal
cases,
even
though
the
district
court
denied
their
suppression
motion?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
am
talking
about
in
criminal
cases.
if
you
look
at
what
happened--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
goes
to
a
quite
different
question
as
to
whether--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
is
positive
evidence
that
he
admitted
his
alienage.
what
is
lacking
is
detailed
evidence
about
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
his
arrest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
is
ample
evidence,
but
it
is
not
very
clear
as
to
the
facts
surrounding
his
arrest.
i
mean,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
had
a
lot
of
difficulty,
too,
and
i
think
that
is,
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
minute,
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
deportation
proceedings,
but
i
just
want
to
bring
home
this
point,
because
i
think
it
is
quite
essential.
if
you
look
at
what
happens
in
criminal
cases,
even
people
who
don't
have
meritorious
fourth
amendment
claims
still
make
suppression
motions.
when
their
motions
are
denied,
they
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
when
their
convictions
are
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
they
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court.
aliens
resisting
deportation
take
advantage
of
every
right
they
think
they
have
to
avoid
an
improper
deportation.
it
is
simply
inconceivable
if
the
exclusionary
rule
was
a
meaningful
aspect
of
the
deportation
process
before
1979
that
there
would
be
no
cases.
where
is
the
beef?
really.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
talking
about
court
cases
as
well.
not...
there
are
no
court
cases
in
which
people
after
they
lost
in
the
bia
appealed
to
the
court
saying
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied.
there
should
be
a
large
volume
of
those
cases.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
some
bia
opinions
that
discuss
and
reject
on
the
merits
claims
that
look
like
fourth
amendment
suppression
claims,
but
very
few.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
told
they
write
about
2,000,
of
which
about
200
are
published
as
precedents.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
less
than
1
percent,
and
the
point
is
that
every
single
one
of
these
people...
look
at
the
class
of
cases
we
are
talking
about.
most
aliens
who
are
apprehended
entered
without
inspection.
they
are
arrested
some
place.
the
only
evidence
we
have
of
their
alienage
is
the
admission
that
they
have
made
after
their
arrest
that
they
are
in
fact
natives
of
mexico
or
wherever
they
may
be.
each
one
of
these
people
could
raise
a
plausible
fourth
amendment
claim.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
way
the
procedure
now
works
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
ins
to
establish
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
alienage,
and
at
that
point
the
burden
shifts
to
the
alien.
now,
if
you
could
tell
me
how
the
ins
can
prove
that
somebody
is
not
a
citizen
when
all
they
have
is
his
body--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--hm?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
that
they
might--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
are
cases
in
which
they
may
find
other
people
who
could
testify
that
this
person--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question
there
was
not
the
alienage
of
the
person
at
deportation
proceedings.
there
are
70,000
deportation
proceedings
a
year.
this
whole
system
is
workable
only
because
there
are
these
reliable
admissions
of
alien
status
which
are
introduced,
and
deportability
is
not
an
issue
in
these
deportation
proceedings.
they
look
to
other
things,
such
as
discretionary
relief.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
are
a
million...
over
a
million
arrests.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
mostly
take
voluntary
departure
at
one
stage
or
another.
the
number...
i
mean,
the
system
would
completely
break
down
if
they
all
asked
for
deportation
hearings.
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
all
of
these
people
or
a
very
large
proportion
of
them
would
have
some
kind
of
fourth
amendment
claim.
they
have
been
arrested.
the
circumstances
of
their
arrest
are
uncertain.
the
evidence
against
them
is
arguably
a
fruit
of
the
arrest.
but
they
don't
appear
in
the
jurisprudence,
so
i
just
think
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
exclusionary
rule
was
a
meaningful
feature.
but
if
you
decide
this
case
against
us,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
will
be
a
tremendous
impact
on
deportation
proceedings
in
the
future.
now,
that
impact
may
be
worthwhile,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
the
benefits
from
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
terms
of
deterring
illegal
searches
and
seizures
by
immigration
officers
are
worth
the
costs.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
make
a
general
point
about
the
perspective
from
which
this
issue
should
be
approached.
there
has
only
been
one
time
before
that
this
court
has
extended
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
significant
new
class
of
cases
and
that
was
mapp
against
ohio.
there
it
was
confronted
not
only
with
the
case
in
which
there
had
been
a
particularly
egregious
fourth
amendment
violation,
but
with
a
situation
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
seemed
to
be
the
only
way
to
curb
a
nationwide
epidemic
of
police
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
that
there
is
nothing
comparable
to
that
that
anybody
is
aware
of
in
the
immigration
context.
nevertheless,
it
wholly
ignored
that
factor.
it
simply
began
its
analysis
by
pointing
out
that
since
ins
agents'
duties
are
to
apprehend
illegal
aliens
for
purposes
of
deportation,
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
in
an
area
within
their
zone
of
primary
interest.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
wouldn't
be
talking
about
confession
cases.
we
are
talking
about
a
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
those
rare
cases
where
that
happens,
and
the
ins
has
changed
its
procedure
so
that
that
happens
much
less
often
than
it
may
have
happened
in
the
past--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
ins
has
recognized
this
so-called
discretionary
due
process
right
to
suppression
of
evidence
in
the
case
of
a
middle
of
the
night
warrantless
search
of
a
home,
but
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
we
would
say
that
it
would
not
apply
even
to
that
kind
of
evidence.
it
would
not
apply...
you
simply
could
not
come
in
and
say,
this
evidence
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
the
statement
is
an
involuntary
statement
that
would
raise
a
separate
question.
it
wouldn't
raise
the
same
question
as
it
does
in
a
criminal
case,
because,
of
course,
they
don't
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
a
deportation
hearing,
but
it
would
raise
a
due
process
question
rather
than
a
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no,
let
me
explain.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
don't
have...
you
don't
have
the
right
not
to
be
compelled.
evidence
can
be
compelled
from
you
for
use
in
a
deportation
proceeding.
of
course
you
have...
and
that
is
what
bilcomski
against
todd
said.
you
can
put
the
alien
on
the
stand
and
ask
him
about
his
nationality.
now,
he
may
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
but
that
is
because
of
the
possibility
of
a
criminal
prosecution
arising
out
of
the
same
conduct.
so
you
have
the
privilege
in
the
sense
that
a
witness
in
a
civil
case
has
the
privilege,
but
you
don't
have
the
privilege
in
the
deportation
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
the
same
privilege
that
a
witness
in
a
civil
case
would
have,
but
it
is
not
a
privilege
against
use
of
compelled
testimony
in
the
deportation
proceeding
itself.
presumably
these
people
could
be
immunized
and
compelled
to
testify
in
the
deportation
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
not
a
criminal
deportation
hearing.
it
would
not
affect
a
criminal
prosecution
for
immigration
law
violations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
does
not.
no.
that
is
not
at
all
the
question,
and
that
is
certainly
not
the
question
that
is
important
to
the
administration
of
the
immigration
system,
because
that
is
a
very
small
part,
and
the
deportation
hearings
are
a
very
major
part.
now,
i
would
like
to
look
first
briefly...
let
me
just
say
that
the
point
that
i
was
making
before
about
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
is
that
to
say
that
this...
these
arrests
are
within
the
zone
of
primary
interest
because
what
they
are
looking
toward
is
the
deportation
of
the
aliens
is
to
raise
an
issue
for
this
court,
because
if
you
didn't
at
least
get
that
far,
there
would
be
no
issue
under
janis.
it
would
be
quite
clear
that
the
exclusionary
rule
wouldn't
apply.
but
i
agree
that
there
is
an
issue
for
this
court
to
consider
which
requires
balancing
the
potential
benefits
in
terms
of
deterrence
of
misconduct
from
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
against
the
special
costs
that
may
exist
in
the
deportation
context.
now,
in
terms
of
the
benefits,
it
is
not,
we
believe,
accurate
to
equate
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
on
immigration
officers
with
the
effect
of
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
criminal
prosecutions
on
police
officers.
there
are
at
least
three
significant
differences
between
this
case
and
mapp
that
make
it
far
less
likely
that
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
will
provide
important
incremental
incentives
to
lawful
conduct.
first
is
the
difference
between
the
countless
local
police
forces
scattered
around
the
country
in
mapp,
and
here
a
single
federal
agency,
which
has
shown
itself
to
be
sensitive
to
fourth
amendment
issues,
which
does
follow
judicial
decisions,
issue
guidelines
to
its
agents
instructing
them
what
they
may
or
may
not
do,
provide
them
with
a
substantial
amount
of
training,
have
disciplinary
procedures,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
dispute
about
how
effective--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
question
for
this
court,
justice
rehnquist,
is
whether
adding
the
exclusionary
rule
in
deportation
proceedings
to
the
existing
means
that
are
available
to
obtain
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
will
provide
a
substantial
increment
of
deterrence
of
illegal
conduct.
i
want
to
make
the
point,
and
i
will
have
to
sit
down
in
a
moment,
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
in
the
activities
and
the
incentives
that
operate
on
ins
agents
and
police
officers
who
are
looking
to
solve
crimes.
ins...
where
a
police
officer
might
make
eight
or
ten
or
fifteen
arrests
in
a
year
leading
to
criminal
prosecutions,
ins
agents
make
hundreds.
in
many,
many
of
the
cases,
it
does
not
go
to
a
deportation
hearing.
there
is
voluntary
departure.
so
that
the
degree
of
probability
that
the
exclusionary
rule
will
actually
be
applied
if
the
agent
violates
the
fourth
amendment
is
far
less,
far
less
in
the
immigration
context
than
it
is
in
the
criminal
context,
and
therefore
the
assumption
of
deterrence
that
the
court
is
willing
to
make
in
the
context
of
criminal
prosecutions
carries
far
less
weight
in
the
context
of
immigration
operations.
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
on
the
cost
side.
my
time
is
running
out,
and
i
would
like
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
well,
then
let
me
make
one
more
point
on
the
benefit
side.
another
important
question
is
the
reliability
of
the
determination
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
violated
in
deciding
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
exclusionary
rule
can't
accomplish
its
purpose
if
it
is
supplied
to
suppress
evidence
that
was
in
fact
lawfully
seized.
so
you
only...
it
is
going
to
work
only
where
it
is
reasonably
accurate
in
identifying
the
class
of
cases
in
which
there
has
been
an
illegal
obtaining
of
evidence,
and
only
the
suppression
of
that
evidence.
now,
as
the
sandoval
case
itself
shows,
the
remedy
cannot
be
applied
with
precision
in
the
deportation
context.
what
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
said
is,
the
officer
couldn't
remember
the
precise
details
of
his
encounter
with
mr.
sandoval,
so
he
hasn't
carried
his
burden
of
proof,
and
so
we
are
going
to
determine
that
the
arrest
was
illegal,
and
so
we
are
going
to
suppress
the
statement,
all
against
a
background
in
which
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
in
all
probability
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
so,
i
think
it
is
very
important,
and
we
made
the
same
point
in
connection
with
the
so-called
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
when
you
are...
as
to
these
cases
where
it
is
difficult
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
won't
work
the
way
you
want
it
to
work.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
sure
that
we
would
argue
that
the
conventional
rule
in
criminal
cases
it
that
if
you
have
a
warrantless
search
or
seizure,
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
court
of
appeals...
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say?
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
mr.
sandoval
was
down
at
the
police
station,
the
agent
couldn't
remember
precisely
why
it
was,
precisely
what
his
interaction
with
mr.
sandoval
was,
and
let
me
make
the
point
that
if
you
look
at
cases
like
florida
against
royer,
and
you
are
asking
yourself
the
question,
was
there
an
illegal
stop--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
movant
in
this
case
told
a
story,
incredible
as
i
think
it
is,
and
never
credited
by
anybody.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
may
be
other
means
of
dealing
with
this
problem
in
terms
of
adjusting
the
traditional
burdens
of
proof
which
would
make
the
problem
less
of
a
problem,
but
i
have
to
emphasize
that
the
problem
on
the
cost
side
of
the
equation
is
not
just
that
a
few
illegal
aliens
will
escape
deportation.
the
problem
is,
what
does
it
do
to
the
system?
and
i
wanted
to
point
out
what
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
said
in
deciding
sandoval,
because
i
think
it
is
very
important.
they
are
the
people
who
know
what
the
immigration,
the
deportation
process
is
like
far
better
than
the
courts,
and
they
said
that
absent
the
applicability
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
questions
relating
to
deportability
routinely
involve
simple
factual
allegations
and
matters
of
proof.
when
fourth
amendment
issues
are
raised
in
deportation
hearings,
the
result
is
a
diversion
of
attention
from
the
main
issues.
the
result
is
asking
people
who
don't
at
least
currently
have
the
expertise
to
decide
these
questions,
and
particularly
pertinent
here,
the
bia
said
the
result
frequently
seems
to
be
a
long,
confused
record
in
which
the
issues
are
not
clearly
defined,
and
in
which
there
is
voluminous
testimony,
but
the
underlying
facts
are
not
sufficiently
developed.
you
have
only
to
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
to
see
that.
i
am
not
sure
what
that
signal
was
in
terms
of
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
all
right.
let
me
just
see
if
there
is
anything
else
i
would
like
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
government
can't
do
anything
directly.
what
it
can
do
is
continue
its
general
enforcement
operations,
and
perhaps
it
will
catch
him
again
in
a
situation
where
it
has
other
evidence.
it
can
do
nothing.
i
mean,
the
alien
is
allowed
to
remain
in
the
united
states
unless
and
until
with
new
evidence
that
is
not
subject
to
suppression
they
can
establish
his
deportability.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
have
a
special
class
of
people
who
are
here
by
virtue
of
a
suppression
motion.
of
course,
this
is
different
from
the
criminal
case
or
even
other
civil
contexts
where,
for
instance,
an
osha
penalty
proceeding,
where
you
might
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
even
though
it
is
a
civil
proceeding,
because
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding
is
to
impose
a
penalty
for
some
past
misconduct
that
at
least
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
traditional
criminal
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly.
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
the
situation
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
in
the
purely
abstract
sense
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
air
applied
in
deportation
proceedings
prior
to
1979
or
not.
i
don't
think
that
was
a
matter
that
was
ever
quite
clear.
there
were
a
number
of
cases
that
reached
the
bia
with
claims
of
fourth
amendment
violations.
some
of
them,
they
said
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
this
is
not
a
large
number
of
cases
compared
to
the
total
case
load
that
we
are
talking
about.
some
of
them
they...
a
lot
of
the
cases
they
cite
are
alien
crewmen
cases,
where
there
was
other
evidence
of
alienage,
and
therefore
the
challenge
to
evidence
was
no
necessary
to
reach
a
decision
in
the
case,
and
therefore
the
bia
had
no
occasion
to
pass
upon
whether
it
should
have
been
admitted
or
excluded.
i
would
not
say
to
you
that
it
was
clear
that
the
exclusionary
rule
did
not
apply.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it
was
inadmissible
anyway?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
settled
principle
that
the
exclusionary
rule
did
not
apply.
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
it
was
not
a
significant
feature
in
any
way
of
the
deportation
hearing
process
or
the
review
process.
and
on
those...
that
handful
of
cases
that
reached
the
bia
where
there
were
substantive
fourth
amendment
questions
raised,
they
either
disposed
of
them
or
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
consider
them
simply
without
deciding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
aware
of
that.
i
am
sorry.
i
will
say
that
there
is
one
case,
this
perez-lopez
case,
that
is
cited
where
deportation
initially
did
not
occur
because
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
this
was
at
the
alj
level.
one
case.
now,
just
ask
yourself,
all
of
these
people
are
being
arrested
in
these
various
kinds
of
encounters
that
are
bound
to
raise
fourth
amendment
issues.
i
just...
i
mean,
i
feel
that
something
that
is
so
clear
to
me
is
perhaps
not
as
clear
to
the
court,
but
how
could
it
have
been
a
meaningful
feature,
and
yet
all
these
people
who
would
have
had
at
least
colorable
fourth
amendment
claims
to
suppress
vital
evidence
in
the
deportation
proceeding
never
went
to
a
court
of
appeals
until
the
wong
chung
che
case
in
1975
in
the
first
circuit.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
an
interesting
point
that
i
wanted
to
get
to.
one
of
the
arguments...
they
had
lawyers
in
the
deportation
process,
i
think,
most
of
them,
but
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
for
why
the
costs
are
not
unacceptable
is
that
most
of
these
people
are
poor,
they
won't
have
lawyers,
they
will
be
deported
anyway,
so
it
is
all
right
to
have
the
exclusionary
rule
because
we
can
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
won't
have
lawyers
to
invoke
these
rights
that
we
are
giving
them.
now,
this
seems
to
be
a
very
odd
way
to
try
to
minimize
the
costs
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
what
it
really
shows...
it
is
true,
most
of
them
don't
have
lawyers.
most
of
them
leave
without
asserting
all
the
legal
rights
that
they
could
assert,
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
the
exclusionary
sanction
is
not
going
to
be
an
effective
way
of
getting
ins
agents
who
are
otherwise
acting
without
regard
to
their
responsibilities
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
change
their
behavior.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
rewriting
the
fourth
amendment.
my
friend
does
not
keep
clearly
in
mind
the
distinction
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
framers
didn't
adopt
the
exclusionary
rule.
they
adopted
the
fourth
amendment.
if
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
substantially
advances
fourth
amendment
values,
a
case
can
be
made
for
it.
if
it
doesn't,
i
think
no
case
can
be
made
for
it.
now,
with
respect
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
their
footnote,
of
course
there
are
some
violations
that
probably
occur
that
are
not...
do
not
involve
the
issues
in
the
delgado
case
that
was
decided
yesterday,
but
i
think
the
vast
bulk
of
claims
do
involve
that
kind
of
claim,
so
that
the
history
of
violations
against
which
the
court
should
decide
whether
it
needs
an
exclusionary
rule
here
is
largely
violations
that
have
turned
out
upon
this
court's
inspection
of
the
legal
issue
not
to
be
violations.
this
also
alters
the
cost-benefit
balance.
these
people
can
still
raise
the
claim.
if
sandoval's
claim
were
to
be
believed,
he
was
walking
through
the
line
with
the
mask
on,
minding
his
own
business.
he
was
grabbed
by
the
seat
of
the
pants,
put
into
the
restroom,
no
questions
asked,
without
any
reason
whatsoever,
taken
down
to
the
station
house,
and
presumably
all
37
of
these
people,
for
all
we
know,
the
same
thing
happened
to
them,
yet
it
happened
just
by
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
all
37
of
these
people
were
illegal
aliens.
they
were
incredibly
lucky
in
using
these
procedures
that
supposedly
violated
the
fourth
amendment
to
have
such
a
good
batting
average.
the
point
in
these
cases
is
that
it
is
going
to
be
very
hard
when
you
get
into
this
kind
of
nitty-gritty,
what
did
the
agent
see,
what
did
the
agent
know,
what
did
the
alien
do,
was
there
a
seizure,
was
it
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion,
at
what
point
was
the
admission
of
illegal
alienage
made,
these
are
exceedingly
intricate
questions.
if
these
70,000
deportation
hearings,
which
now
have
very
few...
have
had
very
few
cases
in
which
that
kind
of
question
is
raised,
if
that
kind
of
question
has
to
be
litigated
in
a
substantial
number
of
these
cases,
and
then
on
appeal
to
the
bia,
and
then,
don't
kid
yourselves,
on
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
because
if
you
say
there
is
an
exclusionary
rule,
you
will
see
this
in
the
courts
as
well
as
within
the
immigration
system.
thank
you.
