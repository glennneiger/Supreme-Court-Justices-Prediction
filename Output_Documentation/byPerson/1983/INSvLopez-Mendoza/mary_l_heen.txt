ms.
mary
l.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
will
remain
enforceable
in
the
immigration
context.
in
the
criminal
law
enforcement
setting,
the
court
seven
years
ago
in
weeks
and
later
in
mapp
versus
ohio
adopted
the
exclusionary
rule
as
the
only
way
to
give
life
and
meaning
to
the
fourth
amendment.
although
deportation
proceedings
have
been
given
a
civil
label,
they
are
completely
analogous
in
this
regard
to
criminal
proceedings.
the
rule
in
deportation
proceedings
functions
in
the
same
way,
serves
the
same
values,
and
provides
the
same
effective
safeguard
against
arbitrary
intrusions
by
government
officials.
i
plan
to
address
here
four
principal
reasons
why
the
government's
arguments
for
a
different
treatment
are
invalid.
first,
the
fourth
amendment
privacy
rights
to
be
protected
are
just
as
important
in
this
context.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
society
generally,
not
just
the
rights
of
those
accused
of
criminal
violations.
second,
the
degree
of
deterrence
is
the
same.
as
in
the
criminal
context,
it
is
direct
and
substantial.
third,
there
are
no
other
remedies
which
will
effectively
enforce
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
alternatives
urged
by
the
ins
in
this
context
are
no
different
than
those
which
have
been
rejected
as
inadequate
and
insufficient
in
the
criminal
setting.
and
fourth,
the
social
costs
of
applying
the
rule
to
deportation
proceedings
are
no
greater
than
the
social
costs
in
the
criminal
setting.
moreover,
the
immigration
system
itself
has
demonstrated
in
the
past
that
it
can
function
under
the
rule
without
excessive
costs.
ms.
mary
l.
heen
well,
as
explained
in
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
the--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--well,
the
administrative
practice
and
the
judicial
history
both
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
substantial
body
of
both
administrative
cases
and
judicial
review
cases
looking
at
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
ms.
mary
l.
heen
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
and
in
addition,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
set
up
a
procedure
for
examining
motions
for
suppression,
placed
the
burden
on
the
alien
to
show
that
the
conduct
was
illegal,
and
then
once
that
prima
facie
showing
of
illegality
was
established,
the
burden
then
would
shift
to
the
government
to
show
the
lawfulness
of
the
conduct
in
a
particular
situation.
so
it
is
clear
that
under
the
administrative
practice--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--the
bia
did
that
in
the
early
seventies.
however,
prior
to
that
time,
it
had
also
looked
at
offers
of
proof
in
this
setting.
it
set
up
the
specific
mechanism
for
review
in
the
matter
of
tsang
case,
matter
of
wong,
and
matter
of
tong
case.
now,
with
regard
to
mr.
frey's
argument
that
there
is
a
paucity
of
decisions
in
this
area,
let
me
just
address
the
population
that
we
are
dealing
with
with
regard
to
the
suppression
motions.
first
of
all,
the
target
population
is
in
general
a
group
that
is
poor.
it
is
legally
unsophisticated,
and
they
are
not
in
general
represented
by
counsel.
secondly,
the
nature
of
the
bureaucracy
itself
tends
to
understate
the
amount
of
the
problem
here,
because
first
of
all
immigration
law
judge
decisions
are
not
reported.
a
substantial
number
of
board
of
immigration
appeals
decisions
are
not
reported.
as
we
just
heard,
it
is
something
like
10
percent
per
year.
and
finally,
there
are
built-in
incentives
in
the
system
so
that
people
tend
to
opt
for
voluntary
departure
rather
than
to
insist
on
their
right
to
a
deportation
hearing.
and
all
of
these
factors--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--i
am
not
suggesting
that--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--there
is
a
mechanism
set
up
so
that
they
can
opt
for
voluntary
departure,
and
in
that
way
avoid
some
of
the
consequences
with
regard
to
being
detained
while
waiting
for
a
hearing,
and--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--it
is
analogous
to
a
plea
bargaining
situation.
however,
getting
back
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
reported
decisions
themselves
indicate
the
amount
of
significance
that
an
exclusionary
rule
could
have
in
terms
of
applying
it
in
this
context,
it
is
clear
that
the
number
of
decisions
themselves
would
not
fully
indicate
the
amount
of
impact
the
decision
could
have
on
the
general
training
and
supervision
of
officers
in
this
context.
a
good
example
in
the
criminal
setting
is
the
reaction
to
this
court's
decision
in
delaware
versus
prouse,
when
the
random
traffic
stop
practice
was
invalidated.
for
example,
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
chief
of
police
issued
a
telex
to
officers
informing
them
of
this
new
practice
with
regard
to
traffic
stops.
the
same
sort
of
mechanism
applies
in
the
immigration
context,
so
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
is
reviewing
the
board
of
immigration
appeals'
decisions
with
regard
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
judicial
review
establishes
the
standards
under
which
these
officers
will
conduct
their
future
investigations.
in
matter
of
sandoval,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
really
turned
its
back
on
its
prior
history,
and
decided
in
large
part
because
of
the
civil
nature
of
the
proceeding
that
it
would
no
longer
apply
the
rule
in
deportation
proceedings.
that
decision
was
erroneous.
it
was
based
in
part
on
a
misapplication
of
the
janis
decision,
and
should
not
be
followed
here.
the
fourth
amendment
privacy
rights
are
just
as
important
whether
the
government
is
enforcing
civil
immigration
laws
or
criminal
laws.
the
fourth
amendment
itself
was
adopted
in
response
to
abuses
which
arose
in
the
enforcement
of
civil
rather
than
criminal
laws.
the
use
of
general
warrants
in
enforcement
of
libel
laws
and
writs
of
assistance
in
enforcement
of
british
taxation
and
import
regulations.
the
privacy
interest
itself
is
the
same.
here,
the
privacy
interest
to
be
protected
and
those
interests
most
threatened
by
ins
intrusions
are
the
targets
of
ins
searches
who
look
like
or
could
be
mistaken
for
illegal
aliens.
at
the
current
time,
that
group
is
composed
largely
of
persons
of
hispanic
or
asian
ancestry.
the
interests
to
be
protected
are
thus
more
important
in
this
context.
for
example,
in
area
control
operations,
ins
inevitably
encounters
numerous
citizens
of
hispanic
ancestry.
in
california,
for
example,
there
are
4.5
million
persons
of
hispanic
dissent,
and
70
percent
of
that
number
are
citizens.
in
texas,
88
percent
of
the
state's
hispanic
population
of
nearly
three
million
are
citizens.
where
those
most
threatened
by
ins
intrusions
are
members
of
a
racially
defined
minority
group,
they
deserve
the
most
resolute
protection
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
next,
with
regard
to
the
deterrent
effect
in
this
context,
as
in
the
criminal
setting,
excluding
illegally
obtained
evidence
in
deportation
proceedings
would
exert
a
substantial
deterrent
effect
on
unconstitutional
conduct.
the
government
concedes
that
deportation
of
illegal
aliens,
not
criminal
prosecution,
is
the
primary
concern
of
immigration
officers.
obtaining
evidence
of
deportation
is
therefore
in
the
officer's
zone
of
primary
interest.
in
addition,
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
offending
ins
officers
work
for
the
same
federal
agency
which
seeks
to
use
the
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
in
their
case
in
chief.
they
share
a
common
law
enforcement
goal
and
purpose,
and
the
agency
utilizes
a
large
investigative
force
in
which
to
perform
this
function.
by
the
very
nature
of
this
process,
therefore,
ins
agents
are
pushed
by
the
pressures
of
their
jobs
to
the
very
limits
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there
are
pressures
on
the
agents
to
apprehend
large
numbers
of
deportable
aliens
rather
than
to
concentrate
on
whether
or
not
their
apprehensions
comply
with
constitutional
standards.
there
is
therefore
in
this
case
a
demonstrable
need
for
a
deterrent
sanction
in
immigration
investigations.
here,
in
addition,
although
the
government
maintains
that
in
this
case
there
is
not
a
serious
penalty
with
regard
to
civil
deportation
proceedings,
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
deportation
can
be
a
severe
punishment.
it
can
be
the
equivalent
of
banishment
or
exile,
and
in
the
words
of
the
court,
it
can
mean
the
loss
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
in
many
cases,
the
civil
consequence
of
a
deportation
proceeding
can
be
of
greater
importance
to
the
individual
and
also
the
law
enforcement
goals
of
the
system
than
imposition
of
a
corresponding
criminal
sanction
for
exactly
the
same
conduct.
therefore,
under
the
rationale
of
one
1958
plymouth
sedan
versus
pennsylvania,
the
serious
consequences
of
deportation
proceedings
provide
another
justification
for
applying
the
rule
in
this
context.
all
of
these
factors
taken
together
sharply
distinguish
this
case
from
janis,
calandra,
and
the
other
cases
in
which
the
court
has
declined
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
here
the
deterrent
effect
is
not
marginal.
it
is
substantial
and
efficient.
ms.
mary
l.
heen
well,
as
in
the
criminal
setting,
the
bivens
actions
or
civil
damage
actions
do
not
provide
an
effective
substitute
for
the
rule.
it
can
be
a
helpful
complement
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
ms.
mary
l.
heen
well,
the
problem
with
regard
to
the
reliance
on
civil
damage
actions
as
a
surrogate
for
the
rule
in
this
context
is
that
first
of
all
the
nature
of
the
population,
which
i
already
mentioned.
the
citizens
who
may
be
apprehended
because
they
work
alongside
illegal
aliens
are
probably
a
population
which
is
very
unlikely
to
have
the
resources
and
the
access
to
legal
representation
in
order
to
pursue
civil
damage
actions,
and
as
the
government
has
conceded
in
its
brief,
bivens
actions
are
very
rarely
successful.
there
is
the
good
faith
immunity
defense
on
the
part
of
ins
officers.
and
with
regard
to
the
deterrent
impact
of
a
civil
damage
action,
the
real
question
is
with
regard
to
those
instances
which
would
not
be
tremendously
flagrant
or
egregious.
the
civil
damage
actions
do
not
provide
the
incentive
for
ins
officers
to
err
on
the
side
of
constitutional
behavior,
and
therefore
cannot
provide
an
effective
alternative
to
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
context.
the
same
is
true
with
regard
to
the
other
alternatives
which
the
government
relies
on.
for
example,
declaratory
and
injunctive
actions.
now,
as
outlined
last
term
in
city
of
los
angeles
versus
lyons,
because
of
equitable
and
standing
prerequisites,
it
is
very
difficult
to
obtain
injunctive
relief.
injunctive
relief
can
be
obtained
only
where
the
victims
of
the
unlawful
actions
can
establish
that
ins
would
subject
them
to
another
unlawful
search
or
seizure.
moreover,
it
must
be
shown
under
rizzo
versus
goode
that
the
actions
are
a
result
of
a
policy
adopted
by
ins.
therefore,
the
injunction
can
be
obtained
only
in
rare
cases,
and
only
after
the
deterrent
mechanism
has
already
failed
with
regard
to
the
institution
of
an
unconstitutional
policy.
reliance
on
internal
rules,
training,
and
discipline
have
not
been
effective
as
an
accepted
alternative
in
the...
acceptable
alternative
in
the
criminal
setting,
and
in
the
case
of
ins,
has
been
used
in
the
past
only
to
sanction
the
most
flagrant
and
appalling
misconduct.
there
are
three
major
failures
of
the
ins
disciplinary
procedures.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
applied
to
fourth
amendment
violations.
secondly,
there
has
been
no
recordkeeping.
and
thirdly,
the
procedures
are
themselves
inadequate
on
their
face.
with
regard
to
the
first
point,
that
ins
does
not
in
fact
discipline
officers
for
fourth
amendment
violations,
ins
can
point
to
no
disciplinary
sanctions
applied
to
ins
officers
for
fourth
amendment
violations
since
the
matter
of
sandoval
decision
in
1979.
in
fact,
the
only
examples
of
discipline
that
ins
has
produced
for
the
last
four
fiscal
years
are
truly
criminal
and
flagrant
misconduct.
three
officers
were
terminated
or
suspended
because
of
rape
of
aliens,
three
for
physical
brutality
of
federal
undercover
agents
posing
as
aliens,
and
in
one
case
a
supervisory
agent
abused
and
detained
a
united
states
citizen
for
19
hours
without
food
or
water,
and
transported
him
to
mexico.
therefore,
it
is
obvious
from
the
way
that
the
internal
procedures
have
been
applied
that
ins
is
not
applying
high
priority
in
terms
of
disciplining
officers
for
fourth
amendment
violations.
secondly,
ins
keeps
no
adequate
records
of
fourth
amendment
violations,
and
does
not
and
therefore
cannot
monitor
the
effectiveness
of
its
training
procedures.
and
third,
as
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
there
are
significant
inadequacies
with
regard
to
the
procedures
themselves
on
their
face.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address--
ms.
mary
l.
heen
--no.
with
regard
to
ladue
versus
nelson,
mendoza
versus
ins,
and
marquez
versus
kiley,
these
cases,
although
only
the
mendoza
versus
ins
case
arouse
subsequent
to
the
matter
of
sandoval
decision,
are
really
used
as
examples
of
the
kind
of
conduct
which
ins
officers
have
overstepped
the
boundaries
with
regard
to
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
their
investigations.
the
government
places
great
reliance
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
are
widespread
violations
in
this
context,
and
i
think
that
we
would
be
closing
our
eyes
to
the
problem
which
exists
with
regard
to
an
area
of
law
enforcement
where
there
are
over
a
million
apprehensions
per
year.
mapp
versus
ohio,
in
which
the
court
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
case
through
the
due
process
clause,
does
not
require
a
showing
of
widespread
violations
prior
to
applying
the
rule.
there,
the
court
held
that
there
is
really
no
fourth
amendment
in
the
criminal
context
without
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
the
government
also
relies
on
the
fact
that
this
is
one
single
federal
agency,
and
therefore
is
more
manageable
with
regard
to
protection
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
if
that
were
the
rationale,
the
fbi,
also
one
single
federal
agency,
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
which
has
always
applied
in
the
context
of
federal
criminal
enforcement
since
weeks,
would
also
apply
in
terms
of
the
rationale.
in
addition
to
the
reported
cases,
with
regard
to
the
indication
of
the
problem
in
this
area,
and
also
the
nature
of
the
population
and
the
nature
of
the
bureaucracy
with
regard
to
this,
i
may
just
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
record
in
this
particular
case,
both
of
the
issues
arose
during
a
time
period
when
the
exclusionary
rule
applied
in
deportation
proceedings,
and
therefore
there
was
no
attempt
to
make
this
kind
of
record
below
with
regard
to
the
extent
of
the
problem.
finally,
i
would
like
to
address
with
regard
to
alternatives
the
government's
reliance
on
the
due
process
exclusionary
rule.
the
government
maintains
that
this
is
a
discretionary
rule,
and
was
not
adopted
as
a
constitutional
requirement,
but
in
terms
of
the
actual
language
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals'
decision
in
matter
of
toro,
and
prior
to
that
in
its
unpublished
decision
in
in
re
ramira-cordova,
it
is
clear
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
felt
that
it
was
compelled
under
the
due
process
clause
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
for
egregious
fourth
amendment
violations,
and
therefore
it
is
analogous
in
some
respects
to
the
rule
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
in
rochen
versus
california
and
later
discussed
in
the
irvine
versus
california
case.
the
problem
with
regard
to
relying
on
this
rule
as
an
effective
alternative
is
that
basically
it
rewrites
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
immigration
context.
in
other
words,
unreasonable
but
less
severe
violations
would
be
permitted
in
this
context.
it
also
fails
to
provide
clear
standards
for
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
this
is
a
problem
which
was
addressed
in
the
irvine
decision
in
the
criminal
context.
and
finally,
because
it
applies
to
intentional
misconduct,
it
may
require
inquiry
into
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
officer.
thus
the
due
process
exclusionary
rule
does
not
provide
adequate
protection
of
fourth
amendment
values.
i
would
like
to
next
address
the
issue
of
the
societal
costs
involved.
the
social
costs
of
applying
the
rule
in
this
context
provide
no
basis
for
a
distinction
between
deportation
proceedings
and
criminal
proceedings,
yet
the
government
argues
that
the
cost
to
society
of
applying
the
rule
in
this
context
is
greater
than
we
can
afford,
even
greater
than
the
cost
borne
by
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
argument
should
be
rejected
for
the
following
three
reasons.
first,
the
immigration
system
has
functioned
under
the
rule
in
the
past
without
excessive
cost.
and
it
presently
functions
under
a
due
process
exclusionary
rule.
for
example,
suppression
motions
are
permitted
for
violation
of
ins
regulations,
and
suppression
motions
are
also
ruled
upon
with
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
statements
and
the
voluntariness
under
the
fifth
amendment.
applying
the
rule
in
deportation
proceedings
therefore
will
not
mark
a
change
in
procedure,
and
will
not
require
the
system
to
adapt
to
something
which
has
not
already
functioned
quite
adequately
in
the
past.
the
government's
attempt
to
label
the
rule's
application
as
a
judicial
licensing
of
unlawful
conduct
is
simply
a
red
herring
in
this
case.
no
special
class
of
aliens
will
result
as
a
consequence
of
applying
the
rule
in
this
context
at
any
time
independent,
untainted
evidence
of
alienage
may
support
a
deportation
order.
in
fact,
as
the
reported
cases
show,
that
is
extremely
common
in
this
context.
in
addition,
the
government
fails
to
note
that
once
the
due
process
exclusionary
rule
is
applied
in
this
context,
and
a
deportation
proceeding
is
terminated
as
a
result
of
that
suppression
motion,
an
alien
also
is
released,
and
that
same
person
can
later
be
apprehended
on
the
basis
of
independent
tips
and
all
the
other
enforcement
mechanisms
that
the
agency
uses
to
apprehend
illegal
aliens.

where
the
ins
goes
into
a
factory
and
surveys
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
illegal
aliens
working
there.
an
example
of
a
pre-matter
of
sandoval
decision
in
which
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
applied
independent
evidence
in
order
to
deport
someone
is
the
case
of
in
the
matter
of
perez-lopez.
and
in
that
case,
which
was
decided
in
1972,
the
immigration
law
judge
had
suppressed
evidence
of
deportability
at
the
original
hearing.
that
hearing
was
terminated,
and
later
on
the
hearing
was
reopened
when
the
agency
received
from
an
informant
information
that
the
person
was
in
this
country
illegally.
therefore,
on
the
basis
of
that
independent
source
of
information,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
upheld
the
deportation
order.
that
provides
an
example
of
how
the
system
has
been
able
to
work
under
the
rule
in
the
past,
and
that
same
sort
of
evidence
can
be
used
in
the
future
in
order
to
deport
those
who
may
be
released
as
a
result
of
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
ms.
mary
l.

well,
there
may
be
some
slight
increase
in
the
number
of
suppression
motions,
which
may
be
tied
to
the
increased
enforcement
activity
of
the
ins
at
the
present
time,
but
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
past
history
of
applying
the
rule
in
this
context,
as
mentioned
earlier,
the
leading
treatise
in
the
field,
going
back
to
its
original
editions,
had
stated
that
it
was
undisputed
that
evidence
obtained
illegally
may
be
suppressed
in
deportation
hearings.
therefore,
it
was
a
part
of
the
recognized
administrative
practice
that
such
suppression
motions
could
be
filed.
in
addition,
there
are
other
types
of
suppression
motions,
not
just
fourth
amendment
suppression
motions,
which
are
filed
in
the
context
of
a
proceeding.
in
terms
of
the
actual
mechanism
established
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
review
suppression
motions,
as
pointed
out
by
board
member
appleman
in
the
dissent
in
matter
of
sandoval,
the
answer
is
really
to
require
a
prima
facie
showing
of
illegality
in
order
to
support
the
suppression
motion
itself,
and
under
the
mechanism
which
was
established
in
the
pre-matter
of
sandoval
decisions,
that
showing
of
illegality
had
to
be
supported
by
affidavits
and
by
a
non-frivolous
offer
of
proof.
therefore,
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
agency
will
be
swamped
by
the
filing
of
frivolous
suppression
motions
can
really
be
addressed
in
terms
of
the
mechanisms
for
review
of
these
motions,
and
the
agency
may
also,
in
addition
to
its
mechanism
for
subpoenas,
require
the
alien
to
file
such
a
suppression
motion
prior
to
the
hearing.
therefore,
the
government
will
be
able
to
respond
in
such
a
case
to
a
non-frivolous
assertion
of
illegality
on
the
part
of
the
government.
what
the
government
is
really
asking
for
in
this
case
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
not
be
enforced
as
rigorously
in
this
context
because
it
would
be
more
efficient
for
the
government
to
enforce
immigration
laws
without
the
fourth
amendment.
so
the
costs
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
this
context
are
really
the
costs
imposed
on
the
enforcement
system
by
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
there
is
a
need
for
neutral
procedures
to
be
adopted
by
the
agency,
or
a
need
for
sufficient
facts
for
the
government
to
justify
its
intrusion,
and
that
cost
analysis
has
already
been
conducted
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
applying
the
fourth
amendment
to
government
intrusions.
it
is
really
unacceptable
for
the
government
to
say
that
it
cannot
enforce
the
immigration
laws
and
live
effectively
within
the
fourth
amendment.
that
is
a
bad
enough
result
when
it
affects
the
rights
of
undocumented
aliens,
and
it
is
an
even
worse
result
when
its
primary
impact
is
on
corroding
the
rights
of
hispanic
americans.
this
court
must
also
consider
the
cost
to
society
posed
by
an
abandonment
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
context.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
case
requires
an
extension
of
the
exclusionary
rule
or
a
return
to
former
long-standing
practice,
what
is
important
with
regard
to
that
consideration
is
whether
or
not,
first
of
all,
the
costs
asserted
by
the
government
are
as
significant
as
they
maintain,
and
if
you
look
at
the
past
history
of
applying
the
rule,
and
the
way
that
the
suppression
motions
have
come
up
in
this
context,
that
cost
is
not
going
to
be
significant
in
terms
of
the
system
being
able
to
adopt
procedures
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
but
the
issue
of
extension
is
also
important
with
regard
to
the
signal
that
it
would
send
to
agents
out
in
the
field
who
are
enforcing
the
immigration
laws.
if
the
signal
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
going
to
be
taken
as
seriously
in
this
context
as
it
is
in
the
criminal
context,
and
abandonment
of
the
rule
will
indicate
to
officers
in
the
field
that
their
actions
will
not
be
reviewed
with
as
much
rigorousness,
and
they
will
have
additional
discretion
in
the
field.
the
real
danger
is
that
officers
will
confuse
ethnicity
with
probable
cause
in
this
area.
this
court
has
structured
a
careful
balancing
of
fourth
amendment
protections
and
law
enforcement
needs
in
the
roving
border
patrol
cases
and
the
fixed
checkpoint
cases.
if
freed
from
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
context,
that
balance
would
be
lost.
inevitably,
given
the
pressures
under
which
ins
officers
work,
ins
officers
would
increasingly
confuse
ethnicity
with
a
reason
for
apprehending
illegal
aliens.
those
who
look
like
the
targets
of
ins
searches
would
be
swept
into
an
ever-growing
net
of
suspicion
and
fear.
in
effect,
the
government
asks
that
hispanic
americans
surrender
the
enjoyment
of
their
fourth
amendment
rights
to
permit
more
efficient
enforcement
of
immigration
laws.
that
is
a
price
that
no
american
may
be
asked
to
pay.
in
sum,
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
in
deportation
proceedings
just
as
it
is
applied
in
criminal
proceedings.
the
privacy
interests
to
be
protected
are
just
as
important
here.
the
rule's
deterrent
effect
is
substantial.
it
has
long
been
applied
in
deportation
proceedings
without
excessive
cost,
and
no
realistic
or
equally
effective
alternatives
exist
which
will
adequately
safeguard
against
violation
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
court
should
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
below.
