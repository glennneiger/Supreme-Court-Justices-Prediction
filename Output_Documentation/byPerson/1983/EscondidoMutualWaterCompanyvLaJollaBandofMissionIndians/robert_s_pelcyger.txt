mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
a
few
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
previously.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
judicial
review
question,
i
agree
with
justice
white's
analysis
of
that.
let
me
just
add
that
i
see
no
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals'
review
of
the
secretary's
conditions
as
opposed
to
the
commission's
own
conditions.
the
record
is
compiled
before
the
federal
power
commission...
the
federal
regulatory
commission,
and
an
applicant,
based
on
that
record,
can
contest
either
the
commission's
conditions
based
on
their
lack
of
reasonableness,
or
the
secretary's
conditions
based
on
their
lack
of
reasonableness,
so
i
don't
see
that
it
presents
any
problems
or
any
difficulties.
with
regard
to
relicensing,
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
point
out
that
section
15,
which
is
their
relicensing
provision,
specifically
says
that
the
commission
is
authorized
to
issue
a
new
license
to--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--is
the--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
think
i
have
a
footnote
on
my
brief
on
that,
your
honor.
i
can
put
my--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
am
quoting
section
15(a).
it
is
16
usc
section
808
(a).
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
it
is
in
the...
i'm
sorry.
it's
in
the
petitioners'
appendix.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
of
the
federal
power
act.
it's
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
at
page
386.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
and
this
is
the
relicensing
provision,
and
i
don't
understand
why
there's
a
controversy
about
whether
this
is
an
original
licensing
or
a
relicensing,
because
the
relicensing
provision
specifically
says
that
the
commission
can
issue
either
a
new
license
or
an
original
license
under
the
then
existing
laws
and
regulations,
and
obviously
the
reservation
proviso
is
an
existing
law.
so,
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
in
the
lac
courte
creilles
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
whole
concept
of
relicensing
was
that
it
would
be
a
new
proceeding,
and
it
would
take
place
under
the
terms
of
existing
laws,
and
this
court...
this
court's
only
decision
dealing
with
this
relicensing
question
was
united
states
against
appalachian
electric
power
company
in
311
usc
76,
where
the
court
specifically
referred
to
the
relicensing
provisions
and
upheld
their
constitutionality
against
the
claim
that
they
would
constitute
an
unlawful
taking
of
land
without
providing
just
compensation.
justice
o'connor,
the
secretary's
conditions
would
not
be
an
adjudication
of
water
rights
by
the
back
door.
the
whole
point
of
the
secretary's
conditions
is
to
set
forth
that
which
would
be
necessary
to
provide
for
the
adequate
protection
and
utilization
of
the
reservation.
those
conditions
can
be
considered
as
if
one
assumed
that
there
were
no
water
rights
of
the
reservations.
the
secretary
is
simply
saying,
this
is
what
is
necessary
to
protect
those
reservations
and
to
ensure
their
adequate
utilization.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
right,
unless
the
petitioners...
it
would
not
affect
the
existing
water
rights
dispute
unless
the
petitioners
were
not
able
to
utilize
their
water
right,
in
which
case
the
dispute
would
not
be
resolved,
but
would
become
moot
essentially.
now,
the
petitioners
are
seeking
here
to
enter
three
indian
reservations
to
gain
use
and
control
of
indian
lands
without
obtaining
the
indians'
consent
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
water
away
from
six
reservations.
the
reason
that
they
are
invoking
the
federal
power
act,
despite
the
fact
that
the
hydroelectric
aspects
of
this
project
are
incidental
and
de
minimis,
is
that
without
a
license
from
the
commission,
they
would
be
required
to
bargain
with
the
bands
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
the
use
of
reservation
lands.
so,
they
are
attempting
to
use
the
power
act
to
circumvent
or
avoid
the
requirements
of
other
laws.
this
is
doubly
ironic
because
in
the
first
place
the
power
aspects
of
the
projects
are,
as
i
indicated,
so
small
and
incidental,
and
secondly
because
the
power
act
so
explicitly
ensures
that
the
interests
of
indians
as
well
as
other
federal
reservations
will
not
be
sacrificed
to
the
development
of
hydroelectric
power.
there
are
two
aspects
of
this
case
that
i
want
to
stress.
the
clearly
expressed--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no,
we
do
not--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--we
did
not
cross-petition
on
that
ground.
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
that
that
issue
is
still
relevant
when
addressing
the
question
of
which
act
is
controlling
in
these
particular
and
unique
circumstances.
the
more
general
statute
of
the
federal
power
act,
which
only
tangentially
applies
to
this
project,
if
at
all,
assuming
it
applies
at
all,
or
the
much
more
specific
provision
of
section
8
of
the
mission
indian
relief
act,
which
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i
agree
with
that,
but
the
question
of
whether
it
overrides
the
mission
indian
relief
act
may
turn
in
part
of
whether
this
case
is
really
a
power
project,
in
which
case
it
would
come
squarely
within
the
federal
power
act,
or
whether
it
is
really
a
water
diversion
project,
and
that
is
its
principal
effect.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
to
put
that
issue
in
context,
our
first
position
is
that
the
provision
of
the
mission
indian
relief
act
must
be
given
effect
because
the
reservation
proviso
specifically
protects
against
interference
the
purposes
of
indian
reservations.
the
mission
indian
relief
act
defines
the
purposes
of
indian
reservations,
and
therefore
pursuant
to
4(e)
must
be
given
effect,
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that,
and
if
the
court
concludes
that
somehow
the
indian
consent
requirement
may
under
some
circumstances
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
power
act,
then
one
looks
to
the
particular
project
involved,
and
since
this
case
is
first
and
foremost
and
primarily
a
water
diversion
project,
the
mission
indian
relief
act
should
control
here
even
if
it
wouldn't
control
if
this
were
a
real,
true
to
life,
honest
to
goodness
power
project.
that
is
our
position.
this
is
not,
let
me
stress,
a
case
in
which
the
indians
must
ask
the
court
to
presume
that
the
federal
government
intended
to
deal
fairly
with
the
indians
or
to
implement
an
assumed
solicitous
attitude.
rather,
both
the
federal
power
act
and
the
mission
indian
relief
act
manifest
on
their
faces
and
in
their
histories
the
clear
and
specific
intent
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
indian
reservations
and
fully
to
protect
indian
property
rights
and
indian
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
correct.
but
this
project
has
two
minimally--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--midsized
power
plants.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
both
of
them
are,
yes.
one
of
them
is
directly
from
a
canal,
and
one
of
them
is
through
a
reservoir.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
this
is--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
for
municipal
use.
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
and
to
vista.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
the
canal
that
crosses
the
reservations.
yes,
we
say
that
the
right-of-way
was
granted,
justice
white,
in
1924
for
50
years.
that
right-of-way
expired
in
1924.
they
have
had
it
for
60
years.
they
got
all
that
they
bargained
for.
they
got
more
than
they
bargained
for.
their
investment
is
fully
paid
off,
and
now
it
is
a
new
proceeding--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes,
although
as
i
explained
to
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
incidental
nature
of
the
power
aspect
can
come
into
play
if
the
court
concludes
that
under
certain
circumstances
if
this
were
a
true
honest
to
goodness
power
project,
indian
consent
would
be
overridden
by
the
act.
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
real
power
project
means
that
effect
can
and
must
and
should
be
given
to
the
very
specific
statute.
after
all,
it
was
the
first
and
only
time
that
congress
specifically
addressed
the
issue
of
what
should
happen
with
regard
to
water
conveyance
projects
across
the
lands
of
the
mission
indian
reservations.
it
enacted
section
8,
and
section
8
requires
the
consent
of
both
the
indian
tribes
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
that
intent
is
what
is
controlling
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes.
the
conveyance
system
is
the
same.
the
water
is
conveyed,
and
it
both
generates--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
there
are
a
combination
of
those
sources.
originally
there
was...
the
secretary
of
the
interior
granted
a
permit
in
1908.
there
was
one
contract
with
an
indian
band
that
was
approved
pursuant
to
section
8.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
at
that
time
there
was
no
power.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
just
water.
let
me
also
point
out
that
both
the
escondido
and
vista
areas,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
that
those
areas
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
their
only
supply
of
water.
both
of
them
have
alternate
sources
of
water
from
the
metropolitan
water
district
of
southern
california
that
bring
in
the
water
from
the
colorado
river
and
northern
california.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
absolutely
right,
and
the
issue
here
is
that
the
san
luis
rey
river
supply
is
somewhat
cheaper
than
the
alternate
supply
that
is
imported
through
the
metropolitan
water
district,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
welfare
or
the
economies
of
these
areas
would
be
adversely
affected
in
the
slightest
bit
if
they
had
to
obtain
all
of
their
water
from
the
alternate
source
where
they
are
now
obtaining
most
of
their
water.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
three.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
and
the
project
diverts
waters
away
from
six
reservations...
six
indian
reservations.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
those
figures
are...
i
don't
have
them
immediately
available.
they
are
in
the
commission's
opinion,
i
am
sure.
now,
so
far
as
the
applicability
of
the
mission
indian
relief
act
is
concerned,
the
petitioners'
primary
contention
is
that
section
8
can
and
should
be
ignored
because
it
was
effectively
repealed
by
the
federal
power
act,
because
they
claim
that
section
8
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
power
act,
but
the
fatal
flaw
in
this
argument
is
that
it
entirely
overlooks
the
reservation
proviso
itself
which
expressly
prohibits
any
interference
with
the
purposes
for
which
the
reservations
were
established.
this
proviso,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
would
be
totally
meaningless
if
congress
intended
to
sanction
the
abrogation
of
the
rights
and
powers
guaranteed
to
indian
tribes
by
preexisting
treaties
and
statutes.
now,
the
other--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--that's
correct.
there
is
dual
protection,
dual
safeguards.
the
petitioners'
other
argument
on
the
mission
indian
belief
act
is
that
section
8
in
the
federal
power
act
should
be
viewed
as
alternate
mechanisms
for
obtaining
canal
rights
of
way
across
mission
reservations.
that
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
the
one
point
on
which
all
parties
in
this
case
are
agreed
is
that
the
use
of
indian
lands
for
a
power
project,
and
this
is
assumedly
a
power
project,
requires
a
commission
license.
now,
it
may
also
require
indian
consent,
and
that
is
the
issue,
but
it
certainly
requires
a
commission
license.
so
since
a
commission
license
would
be
required
and
necessary
in
any
event,
obtaining
the
consent
of
the
indians
on
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
section
8
is
not
a
true
alternative.
it
would
be
entirely
superfluous
and
unnecessary,
because
it
would
never
be
utilized
if
the
commission's
license
had
to
be
obtained
in
any
event.
by
contrast,
requiring,
as
both
the
bands
and
the
secretary
contend,
requiring
both
a
commission
license
as
well
as
compliance
with
section
8
of
the
mission
indian
relief
act
gives
effect
to
both
statutes
while
preserving
their
overall
sense
and
purpose,
and
does
not
subordinate
one
to
the
other.
on
the
definition
of
reservations,
i
agree
with
mr.
schulder.
the
ambiguity
that
is
created
here
is
that
water
rights
are
expressly
concluded,
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
within
the
act's
definition
of
reservations.
that
much
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
ambiguity
arises
because
the
reservation
proviso
applies
to
licenses
within
a
reservation,
and
the
question
is,
how
can
a
license
be
within
a
water
right?
that
doesn't
really
make
sense,
and
so
that
is
a
real
true
to
life
ambiguity,
and
our
contention
is
that
that
ambiguity
has
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
downstream
reservations
for
several
reasons.
first
and
foremost
is
that
that
interpretation
carries
out
and
furthers
the
evident
protective
purpose
toward
reservations
in
the
federal
power
act,
both
in
the
reservation
proviso
itself
as
well
as
in
the
broad
definition
of
reservation
in
the
act,
and
secondly,
as
mr.
schulder
pointed
out,
because
of
the
provision
in
section
23(b)
that
indicates
that
the
word
4(e),
and
thirdly,
because
section
10(e)
of
the
act
expressly
uses
the
term
"tribal
lands
embraced
within
indian
reservations.
"
in
defining
when
manual
charges
are
to
be
fixed
by
the
commission.
so,
when
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
term
10(e).
thank
you.
