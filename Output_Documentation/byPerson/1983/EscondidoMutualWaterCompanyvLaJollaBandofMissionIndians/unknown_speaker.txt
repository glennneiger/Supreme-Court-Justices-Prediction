unknown
speaker
mr.
feit,
what
effect
would
such
a
recognition
have
on
the
water
rights
litigation
that
is
pending
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
feit,
you
haven't
said
much
about
the
statutory
language.
it
is
pretty
strong.
it
is
mandatory
language,
"shall
be
subject
to
and
contain
such
conditions
as
the
secretary
shall
deem
necessary.
"
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
even
have
the
word
"reasonable"
in
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
briefs
suggests
that
section
15
of
the
federal
power
act
controls
with
respect
to
relicensing.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
do
you
still
concede
that
if
you
are
correct,
that
the
conditions
imposed
by
interior
have
to
be
reasonable
conditions?
unknown
speaker
and
how
is
the...
what
is
the
process
for
review
of
the
legality
of
those
conditions?
how
does
it
work
in
light
of
section
313?
it
is
very
unclear
to
me
how
you
think
the
issue
would
be
raised.
does
it
go
to
the
commission
in
the
first
place,
the
power
commission
in
the
first
place
to
decide?
and
how
is
the
judicial
review
triggered?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
do
you
see
the
review
taking
place,
and
how
mechanically
would
it
work?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
commission
thinks
that
they
are
unreasonable.
how
is
the
issue
joined
and
put
before
the
court?
unknown
speaker
the
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
contemplates
some
sort
of
a
record
having
been
made
somewhere,
doesn't
it?
if
the
commission
can't
examine
it
all
under
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
conditions,
where
would
the
record
be
made
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
would
review
reasonableness?
unknown
speaker
presented
to
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
suggesting
that
all
the
evidence
would
be
presented
to
the
commission,
but
that
the
commission
can't
make
a
finding
on
it.
they
can't
weigh
it.
they
can't
consider
it.
they
can't
make
a
finding.
so
what
is
the
court
of
appeals
review?
it
is
just
confusing
to
see
how
it
would
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
agree
there
is
a
problem,
don't
you,
on
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
but
apa
review
ordinarily
goes
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
nothing
in
4(e)
that
prevents
the
commission
from
making...
giving
its
opinion
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
or...
i
thought
you
said
that
a
while
ago--
unknown
speaker
--that
they
could
voice
a
disagreement.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
suppose
the
parties
before
the
administrative
law
judge
could
introduce
any
evidence
going
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
conditions.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
think
4(e)
would
be
satisfied
if
the
commission
said,
we
have
to
incorporate
these
conditions.
we
have
hassled
around
with
the
secretary.
he
won't
give
an
inch.
these
are
the
conditions
he
insists
on,
so
we
have
put
them
in
the
license,
but
we
think
they
are
improvident,
unreasonable,
and
that
they
will
in
effect
destroy
this
project.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
say
they
have
no
power
to
make
a
finding
about...
or
to...
as
to
reasonableness?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
concede
that
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
the
commission
reads
it,
it
could
say
the
secretary
is
out
of
his
mind.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
in
a
position
to
review
it.
unknown
speaker
so
where
does
that
leave
us
in
this
case,
mr.
schulder?
unknown
speaker
the
commission
didn't
include
those
conditions.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
does,
there
would
still
be
left
over
the
reasonableness
of
those
conditions.
unknown
speaker
so
we
shouldn't
reach
that
issue
now,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
sooner
or
later
it
likely
will
be.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
well,
mr.
schulder,
no
one
else
wants
to
initiate
review
of
the
commission's
order,
including
now,
as
you
tell
us
you
must,
the
secretary's
conditions.
may
the
commission,
disagreeing
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
conditions,
initiate
that
review?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
disagreement
with
the
conditions.
it
is
fearing
that
they
are
unreasonable.
it
is
not
something
that
the
commission
can
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
review.
unknown
speaker
the
applicant
can.
unknown
speaker
if
the
applicant
wants
to
accept
the
conditions,
of
course,
that...
i
suppose
there
won't
be
any
case
left.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
say
the
commission
could
appear
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
give
its
view.
unknown
speaker
and
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
schulder,
what
about
the
word
4(e)?
camp
pendleton
is
not...
the
power
project
is
not
within
camp
pendleton,
nor
is
it
within
three
of
the
reservations
here,
as
i
understand
the
record.
unknown
speaker
you
rely
on
the
plain
language
for
part
of
your
argument,
but
i
don't
suppose
you
do
for
those
three
reservations.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
the
plain
language
is
plain
when
it
helps
you,
and
is
ambiguous
when
it
doesn't
help
you?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
not
exactly.
but
close.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
is
there
an
issue
before
us
as
to
the
power
of
the
tribes
to
veto?
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
hasn't
been,
what
is
the
authority
of
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
right
in
that
regard,
does
that
render
the
rest
of
the
case
almost
beside
the
point?
unknown
speaker
it
might?
what
could
they
veto
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
to
the
extent
it
is
going
to
be
changed?
there
is
already
a
canal
across
their
reservations,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
so
you
treat
this
as
a
new
licensing.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
tribes
have
a
veto,
why,
the
case
is
really
over.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
i
am
a
little
bothered
by
the
posture
of
the
case
that
justice
white
just
adverted
to.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
is
seeking
an
original
license
for
a
project
that
has
never
been
built
before,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
the
indian
reservation,
federal
reservations
generally
should
have
a
veto
power,
and
shouldn't...
you
shouldn't
put
it
in
where
they
don't
want
it,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
if
it
is
basically
their
jurisdiction.
but
if
substantial
outlays
have
already
been
made
for
pipes
and
canals
and
that
sort
of
thing,
then
is
the
inquiry
exactly
the
same
at
the
relicensing
stage?
unknown
speaker
it
had
all
been
returned.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
one
of
the
briefs,
the
section
you
are
quoting
from?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
just
reading,
is
it
in
one
of
the
briefs
where
one
could
find
it?
unknown
speaker
what
section
are
you
quoting
from?
unknown
speaker
of
what
act?
unknown
speaker
what
act
are
you--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
have
no
effect
on
the
pending
water
rights
litigation?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
challenging,
are
you,
mr.
pelcyger,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission--
unknown
speaker
--because
of
the
thin
reed
that
the
power
thing
is
hinged?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
halfway
house.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
concede
that
it
is
before
the
federal
power
commission,
the
federal
power
act
certainly
applies.
that
doesn't
say
it
overrides
the
mission
indian
act.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
then
if
it
were
60
percent
power
and
40
percent
water
diversion,
which
i
take
it
this
is
not,
the
bands
would
have
a
weaker
case?
unknown
speaker
what
business
does
the
commission
have
or
what
authority
does
it
have
over
a
straight
water
diversion
project?
none,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
one
of
the
power
plants
built
and
isn't
it
run
by
water
taken
out
of
a
reservoir
by
a
canal?
unknown
speaker
and
the
canal
takes
water
for
metropolitan
use.
unknown
speaker
just
a
straight
power--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
down
to
escondido?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
say
that
that
project
is
at
risk
now
too,
that...
just
the
metropolitan
water
use?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
wholly
aside
from
whether
it
is
a
power
project
or
not.
unknown
speaker
was
the
original
50-year
license
for
the
water
project
at
that
time
tied
up
with
the
power
project
too,
or
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
was
long
before
the
federal
power
act.
unknown
speaker
and
so
from
whom
did
the
easement
for
right-of-way
run?
unknown
speaker
for
both
the
power
and
the
water?
unknown
speaker
just
water?
unknown
speaker
they
might
also
strike
a
deal
with
the
tribe.
unknown
speaker
they
just
might
have
to
pay
a
little
more
money.
unknown
speaker
through
how
many
reservations
does
the
canal
go?
unknown
speaker
three.
unknown
speaker
and
how...
what's
the
total
mileage
of
the
canal
as
it
runs
through
the
reservations?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
even
if
you
are
wrong
on
that,
if
the
secretary
happens
to
be
right
on
his
side
of
the
case,
he
will
have
the
authority
to
put
all
the
conditions
in
he
wants
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
the
united
states
agrees
the
secretary's
conditions
must
be
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
and
that
even
the
commission
may
say
what
it
thinks
about
his
conditions.
they
just
have
to
put
them
in.
