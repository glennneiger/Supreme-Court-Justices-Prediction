mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
has
been
stated,
this
case
involves
the
reach
and
scope
of
the
proviso,
the
licensing
proviso
in
section
4(e)
of
the
federal
power
act.
of
principal
concern
to
the
commission
today
is
the
context
involving
the
distribution
of
authority
under
that
proviso
between
ferc
and
interior.
the
proviso
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
main
opening
brief,
and
requires
that
before
issuing
a
license
over
reservation
lands,
the
commission
must
find
that
the
license,
and
i
quote,
"will
not
interfere
or
be
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
for
which
such
reservation
was
created
or
required,
and
should
be
subject
to
and
contain
such
conditions
as
the
secretary
of
the
department
under
whose
supervision
such
reservation
falls
shall
be
deemed
necessary
for
the
adequate
protection
and
utilization
of
such
reservation.
"
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
purporting
to
rely
on,
and
we
believe
erroneously,
on
the
plain
language
test,
held
that
the
commission
may
not
alter
those
conditions
in
any
way.
if
the
commission
is
of
the
view
that
the
terms
are
inappropriate
or
improper
for
the
license
it
wishes,
it
may
simply
not
issue
the
license.
the
court
further
held
that
this
conclusion
did
not
grant
the
secretary
313
of
the
federal
power
act.
it
is
our
view
that
the
position
of
interior
and
the
court
below
seriously
misapprehends
the
intent
underlying
the
section
4(e)
proviso
and
undercuts
in
that
regard
the
thrust
and
purpose
of
the
act,
the
licensing
thrust.
surely
at
most
times
there
is
no
problem.
both
provisions
work
together.
the
commission
protects
the
physical
homeland,
and
that
is
what
the
inconsistency
and
interference
finding
is
all
about,
the
security
of
the
physical
land,
the
population,
the
number
of
homes
in
the
area,
the
overall
impact
on
the
reservation
qua
a
place
for
indians
to
live.
the
secretary,
on
the
other
hand,
in
our
view
has
a
lesser
but...
not
a
lesser
in
importance,
certainly,
but
lesser
in
scope.
he
must
see
to
it
that
the
project
works,
the
project
works
be
not
so
placed
which
would
interfere
with
the
health,
safety,
recreation,
water
flow,
access
roads,
all
of
those
things
to
protect
the
reservation
and
see
that
the
works
are
properly
utilized.
but
beyond
this,
and
there
is
an
inherent
tension
between
the
two
provisos,
the
interference,
inconsistency
proviso
and
the
protection
proviso.
the
tension
arises
because
in
a
sense
they
both
work
with
another.
that
is,
the
secretary
supports
the
absolutist
theory,
saying
that
the
conditioning
power
has
no
bearing
on
the
interference,
inconsistency
authority.
the
two
functions
are
separate.
that
is
not
true
as
we
read
those
two
provisions.
one
may
well
be
at
war
with
the
other,
and
it
seems
to
us
the
protection
provision
may
try
to
take
over
the
interference,
inconsistency
provision.
two
examples
suffice,
i
think.
the
pidgeon
river
case,
which
is
an
old
administrative
case
in
which
secretary
ickes
wished
that
a
dam
not
be
built
on
an
indian
reservation,
and
he
submitted
evidence
in
support
of
the
view
that
the
inference,
inconsistency
determination
should
be
exercised
by
the
commission
in
a
way
against
issuance
of
a
license,
but
he
said
in
any
event
i
am
going
to
submit
conditions
which
will
not
permit
the
dam
to
be
built
at
all.
this
case,
i
think,
also
further
illustrates
where
the
secretary
seeks
to
impose
upon
the
authority,
the
inconsistency,
interference
authority
of
the
commission.
what
has
happened
here
is,
proviso
4,
for
example...
excuse
me,
condition
4
submitted
by
the
secretary
would
require
the
commission
to
recognize
the
reserved
water
rights
of
the
indians.
well,
the
water
rights
issue
is
essentially
not
our
business
in
terms
of
defining
rights.
that
question
is
now
in
the
federal
district
court,
where
it
has
been
since
1969.
we
have
an
open-ended
condition
in
the
license
which
provides
that
the
ultimate
resolution
of
that
issue
by
the
district
court
will
ultimately
inform
the
license
that
we
issue,
so
it
is
hard
for
us
to
perceive
how
this
case
involved
a
proper
invocation
of
a
power
by
the
secretary.
let
me
just
turn--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--a
recognition
of
the
reserve
interest
rights?
i
don't
think
anything
in
that
sense
of
the
word.
i
think
that
our
statute
precludes
us
from
making
such
a
finding.
it
would
be
ultra
viries
of
our
authority.
to
that
extent,
i
think
the
district
court
opinion
would
be
the
one
that
is
cold
sway
in
the
day,
that
is,
that
courts
make
that
determination,
and
this
commission,
if
it
tried
to
do
so,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
exercising
absolute
power
that
it
just
doesn't
have.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
supports
our
view.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
point
out
there
is
an
error
at
page
5
of
our
second
supplemental
brief
in
which
we
attribute
to
congressman...
excuse
me,
to
senator
walsh
a
statement
made
by
congressman
walsh
in
an
effort
to
distinguish
senator
walsh's
apparent
approval
of
the
veto
authority.
that
is
an
unfortunate
error.
i
am
sorry
for
it.
but
in
any
event
it
seems
to
us
that
senator
walsh's
statement
is
not
all
that
persuasive.
it
was
made
in
terms
of
a
discussion
with
regard
to
the
appropriateness
of
giving
the
indians
the
authority
to
stop
a
project
and
the
senator
was
responding
to
that.
also,
congressman
walsh,
the
statement
we
attribute
to
the
senate,
did
make
that
statement.
he
made
it
to
congressman
rayka,
who
in
fact
was
the
house
proponent
of
the
administration's
bill
and
made
clear
that
he
thought
one
vote
could
not
terminate
a
project
with
two
votes
on
the
commission,
which
was
then
comprised
of
the
three
secretaries,
war,
agriculture,
interior.
there
are
statements
in
the
secretary's
brief
regarding
the
notion
in
the
debate
for
the
'20
act
indicating
that
there
was
the
view
that
a
secretary
could
veto
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
the
evidence
of
legislative
intent
is
spelled
out
more
in
our
favor
by
other
remarks
which
we
have
adduced
in
our
brief,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
one
aspect,
this
aspect,
we
think,
as
our
brief
points
out,
we
have
the
better
of
the
day.
the
one
area
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
not
referred
to
at
all
in
the
secretary's
brief,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
the
legislative
history
focuses
again
on
no
water
control,
no
water
control
by
the
commission,
a
focus
on
property
rights,
property
rights,
not
broad
interests,
indian
concerns
in
the
broadest
sovereignty
sense,
and
i
think
one
illustration
again
here
is
good.
the
legislative
history
stems
from
the
rights-of-way
statute.
it
is
clear
that
the
1920
act
took
those
rights-of-way
statutes
as
their
base,
developed
on
them,
built
on
them,
provided
for
them
in
the
act.
at
that
time,
under
those
rights-of-way
statutes,
the
particular
secretary
had
control
over
what
we
call
now
the
interference,
inconsistency
finding
within
those
particular
statutes.
he
also
had
the
conditioning
authority,
but
the
conditioning
authority,
of
course,
was
not
meant
to
overcome
the
broad
licensing
authority
that
that
rights-of-way
statute
provided.
on
the
contrary,
it
was
to
be
exercised
reasonably,
and
that
is
all
we
say
here,
that
when
congress
enacted
the
1920
act,
what
was
a
single
power
in
each
of
the
secretaries
under
the
statutes
they
enforced
became
bifurcated.
the
commission
was
given
the
licensing
power.
the
secretary
was
to
retain
the
conditioning
power,
the
impact
of
the
project
works
on
the
reservation,
that
power
to
be
exercised
with
reason.
the
secretary
says,
however,
yes,
we
agree
with
the
reasonableness
approach
to
this
case.
however,
that
is
a
matter
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
deal
with,
and
all
the
commission
has
to
do
is
simply
include
the
secretary's
condition,
and
if
it
is
unreasonable
or
arbitrary,
the
court
of
appeals
will
remedy
the
situation.
we
don't
think
this
really
answers
the
question.
in
our
view,
it
turns
the
review
statutes
on
its
head.
section
313
of
the
power
act,
a
and
b,
deals
with
review.
the
court...
i
might
say
the
court
below
realized
the
difficulty
of
using
313.
initially
on
the
opinion
it
relied
upon
the
apa
saying
the
secretary's
condition
will
be
reviewed
under
the
apa,
the
commission's
under
the
power
act.
on
rehearing,
the
court
retreated,
saying,
well...
recognizing
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
city
of
takoma
case
that
the
review
provisions
of
section
313
are
absolute,
unconditional,
and
all
issues
must
be
resolved
therein.
let
me
illustrate
the
problems
of
such
a
review
provision.
under
313(a),
the
commission
in
its
own
judgment
may
take
a
case
back
before
a
record
is
filed
from
a
court
of
appeals.
what
do
we
do?
does
interior...
we
obviously
can't
do
that.
the
commission
may
change
its
rule
on
rehearing.
we
have
a
statute
which
requires
a
rehearing
requirement
after
the
issuance
of
the
order.
the
commission...
the
language
is
absolute
in
the
statutory
provision.
obviously
we
can't
do
that.
we
have
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
establish
a
record
evidence,
substantial
evidence
test.
the
secretary's
conditioning
authority,
if
it
is
unalterable,
imposes
no
requirement
of
a
hearing
or
a
discussion
of
any
sort.
how
do
we
determine
that?
we
have
the
obligation
to
enforce
our
orders
as
well
as
our
statute.
how
do
we
do
that?
the
secretary
says,
well,
the
third
party
may
raise
the
issue.
the
third
party
doesn't
represent
the
public
interest.
the
commission
does,
and
the
commission
is,
it
seems
to
us,
in
a
bifurcated,
unreal
position,
a
distortion
of
the
statutory
terms.
in
sum,
it
is
our
position
that
the
licensing
authority
of
the
commission
is
the
central
power
to
weigh
and
balance
those
interests
which
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
gave
the
commission
to
decide
in
determining
whether
to
issue
a
license.
the
commission
is
obligated
under
statutory
terms
to
make
a
determination
that
the
license
is
not
inconsistent
with
nor
does
it
interfere
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
reservation
was
created
or
acquired.
that
is
the
central
power
of
the
commission.
the
secretary,
it
seems
to
us,
has
the
lesser
power,
which
we
normally
give
great
deference
to,
and
the
problem
rarely
arises
to
make
such
conditions
which
relate
to
the
way
the
project
works
impact
on
the
reservation,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
kind
of
decision-making
resting
with
the
commission,
at
that
time,
the
secretary
having
made
a
record
the
other
way,
can
seek
review.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
i
will
turn
to
that
right
now,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
us,
of
course,
that
this
court
has
said,
the
statutory
language
must
really...
even
the
use
of
"shall"
may
not
be
absolute.
people
were
saying--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--they
didn't
put
the
word
"reasonable"
in,
but
i
think
it
was
implicit
in
the
situation
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted.
it
seems
to
us
what
happens
is
this.
to
the
extent
that
the
secretary
performs
in
this
area
where
there
is
no
tension,
and
most
of
the
situations
are
not,
we
will
accept
that
condition,
and
i
think
that
is
what
they
were
trying
to
say
in
the
'20
act.
it
seems
to
me
if
they
were
trying
to
say
something
else
than
that,
then
they
would
have
said
that.
they
wouldn't
have
give
the
commission
the
licensing
authority.
and
the
way
the
commission...
the
commission
must
have
the
power,
it
seems
to
us,
to
assure
that
the
conditioning
authority
is
not
used
to
defeat
the
interference,
inconsistency
determination.
it
is
there
where
the
statute
is
not
absolute.
it
is
there
where
"shall"
does
not
mean
a
veto.
that
is
where
"shall"
simply
means
in
the
context
of
the
exercise
of
clear
authority.
otherwise,
mr.
justice,
as
i
said,
313(b)
is
turned
on
its
head.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
sir.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that
is
issue
we
believe
is
not
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case,
since
the
commission
specifically
treated
this
license
as
an
original
license.
and
under
the
chenery
case
and
other
cases,
it
seems
to
us
the
court
cannot
reach
out
and
decide
that
case
where
the
commission
has
not
decided
it.
thank
you.
