mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
my
remarks
by
focusing
on
the
reservation
proviso
of
section
4(e)
of
the
power
act.
the
language
of
that
proviso
clearly
shows
in
our
view
that
congress
sought
to
ensure
that
reservations
would
be
protected
from
the
adverse
effects
of
power
development.
it
is
only
after
considering
the
import
of
the
section
4(e)
proviso
that
the
legal
issues
presented
here
can
be
properly
addressed.
it
is
the
secretary's
position
here
that
the
statute,
section
4(e),
means
exactly
what
it
says.
the
statute
provides
that
licenses
may
be
issued
for
projects
on
reservations,
but
only
if
the
commission
make
a
finding
that
the
license
will
not
interfere
or
be
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
for
which
the
reservation
was
created,
but
also
licenses
are
specifically
made
to
be
subject
to
and
to
contain
such
conditions
as
the
secretary
of
the
department
under
whose
supervision
the
reservation
falls
shall
deem
necessary
for
the
adequate
protection
and
utilization
of
the
reservation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
issue
could
not
go
to
the
commission
to
decide,
because
that
would
negate
the
clear
intent
of
section
4(e).
section
4(e),
which
is
the
substantive
grant
of
authority
that
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
clearly
provides
that
it
is
the
secretary
who
shall
determine
which
conditions
should
be
included
within
the
license,
so
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
the
secretary
can
merely
recommend
conditions
to
the
commission.
that
would
read
the
second
part
of
the
reservation
proviso
out
of
the
act.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
commission
and
the
petitioners
have
argued
that
this
would
create
some
problems
for
judicial
review.
there
are
several
responses
that
i
have
to
that.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
would
be
a
case
of
the
tail
wagging
the
dog.
i
mean,
it
is
the
substantive
provision
in
4(e)
that
gives
the
secretary
the
power.
if
there
are
any
difficulties,
and
i
don't
concede
that
there
are
in
terms
of
reviewing
the
secretary's
condition,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
accommodation
should
be
made
on
the
judicial
review
end
of
the
spectrum
rather
than
cutting
back
the
secretary's
authority.
mr.
elliott
schulder
okay.
the
secretary's
conditions
must
be
included
in
the
license
that
the
commission
issues.
the
commission's
order
issuing
the
license
is
subject
to
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
313
of
the
power
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
commission
can
do
one
of
two
things
at
the
licensing
stage.
the
commission
can
either
issue
the
license
with
the
conditions
and
make
clear
in
its
order
that
it
does
not
agree
with
the
reasonableness
of
those
conditions.
the
applicant
at
that
point
certainly
could
challenge...
the
applicant
for
the
license
certainly
could
challenge
those
conditions
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
secretary
would
be
obligated
to
defend
those
conditions
under
the
statutory
standard
that
is
laid
out
in
4(e).
in
other
words,
the
secretary
must
show
that
the
conditions
that
he
prescribes
are
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
the
purposes
of
the
reservation
are
adequately
protected,
and
that
the
reservation
is
adequately
utilized.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
record,
as
in
this
case,
would
be
the
same
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
the
applicant
could
present
whatever
evidence
or
information
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
conditions--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--presented
as
part
of
his
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
there
are
several
ways
in
which
this
could
be
done.
first
of
all,
the
secretary,
as
he
did
in
this
case,
notified
the
parties
of
the
proposed
conditions
that
he
intended
to
issue.
he
then
asked
for
comments
upon
those
conditions,
and
i
believe
one
of
the
applicants
did
file
certain
comments.
that
is
one
way
in
which
the
parties
would
have
an
opportunity
at
the
administrative
level
to
make
their
views
known.
second,
in
the
course
of
presenting
evidence
to
the
commission
on
other
aspects
of
the
license,
the
parties
would
be,
certainly
with
respect
to
the
interference,
inconsistency
finding,
would
present
evidence
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
secretary
in
his
determination
of
whether
the
conditions
that
he
proposes
to
include
are
proper.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
secretary
modified
the
initial
conditions
in
order
to
take
into
account
the
evidence
that
had
been
brought
out
before
the
administrative
law
judge.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
may
be
confusing,
but
the
problem
here
is
with...
the
problem
here
is
not
with
4(e).
if
there
is
any
problem,
it
may
be
with
the
judicial
review
provision
of
the
statute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
commission
under
4(e)
has
no
power
to
make
any
finding
with
respect
to
the
secretary's
conditions,
and
has
no
power
to
alter
or
modify
those
conditions,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
4(e)
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
permissible
or
proper
for
the
secretary's
conditions
to
be
reviewable
before
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
apa
review
standards
as
part
of
the
same
procedure
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
considering
the
commission's
order
issuing
the
license.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
ordinarily
does,
but
it
does
not
in
every
case,
your
honor.
the
provisions
of
the
apa
specifically
provide
that
it
would
go
to
the
appropriate
court
to
hear
that
matter,
and
here,
since
the
whole
case
is
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
commission's
order,
it
certainly
seems
appropriate
that
it
would
be
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
pass
upon
in
the
first
instance
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary's
conditions.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
that
is
precisely
what
congress
intended
when--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
was
just
talking
in
terms
of
the
technical
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
right,
and
this
is
precisely,
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
water
power
act
prior
to
its
enactment
in
1920,
this
is
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind.
if
we
look
at
the
statements
on
pages
26
and
27
of
the--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--where
does--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
that
it
follow
the
statute
and
include
the
secretary's
conditions.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
it
is
absolutely
not
before
the
court
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
but
the
secretary's
conditions
have
not
been...
they
are
not
part
of
the
commission's
order,
because
the
commission
refused
to
include
them.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
your
honor,
because
the
whole
process
under
4(e)
is
a
process
in
which
an
applicant
goes
to
the
commission
requesting
the
license.
presumably
if
the
applicant
is
not
sufficiently
interested
to
pursue
the
matter,
then
that
is
the
end
of
it.
the
commission
has
no
affirmative
authority
to
issue
licenses
where
there
are
no
applicants.
mr.
elliott
schulder
not
on
its
own
initiative.
it
can
certainly
make
its
views
know.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
this
regard,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
of
course
section
4(e)
refers
not
only
to
reservations
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
but
also
to
reservations
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
secretary
of
defense.
in
fact,
if
your
honors
would
take
a
look
at
the
map
that
has
been
provided
by
petitioners,
it
does
not
appear
on
the
map,
but
several
miles
north
of
oceanside
is
a
very
large
marine
base
called
camp
pendleton.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
there
were
any
adverse
effects
of
any
project
with
respect
to
camp
pendleton,
the
secretary
of
defense
should
be
free--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
is
not
exactly
that
we
don't
rely
on
the
plain
language.
the
problem
is
that
the
plain
language
doesn't
really
make
sense.
when
you
think
of
the
broad
definition
of
the
term
25
to
26
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
a
water
right
clearly
is
an
interest
in
land.
now,
certainly
there
is
an
ambiguity.
it
doesn't
sound
right
to
say
that
a
license
is
issued
within
a
water
right.
mr.
elliott
schulder
not
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
real
ambiguity
here,
because
of
the
broad
definition
of
the
term
"reservations"
in
the
definitional
section
of
the
act.
and
if
you
take
that
into
consideration
with
section
23(b),
which
states
that
the
commission
shall
issue
licenses
where
a
project
will
have
an
effect
on
a
reservation,
that
suggests
to
us
that
in
fact
given
the
protective
nature
of
the
definition
of
reservations,
the
protective
nature
of
section
4(e)
itself,
that
in
fact
the
secretary
of
defense
would
be
entitled
to
impose
conditions
on
a
license
if
an
upstream
project
were
threatening
to
impair
the
utilization
of
that
military
base.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
issue
about
whether
section
8
of
the
mission
indian
relief
act
has
been
impliedly
repealed
by
the
federal
power
act
is
the
third
issue
in
the
case,
and
it
is
our
position,
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
that
it
has
not
been
repealed
by
the
federal
power
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
if
it
has
not
been,
than
any
water
conveyance
facility
that
will
be
going
across
a
reservation
land
must
be
approved
by
the
bands
before
that
facility
can
be
operated.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
might
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
they
could
state
that
they
do
not
agree
to
the
canal
going
across
their
reservations.
that
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct,
but
to
the
extent
that
it
is
going
to
continue
in
operation,
and
also
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
changed
in
the
future.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
this
case
should
be
treated
as
an
original
license.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
believe
that
it
is,
because
every
applicant
at
the
relicensing
stage
is
at
an
equal
level.
congress
specifically
provided
in
the
federal
power
act
that
there
would
be
a
50-year
term
to
the
license,
and
i
believe
the
bands'
brief
in
its
introduction
to
the
summary
of
argument
sets
out
the
statutory
scheme.
in
fact,
the
commission
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
net
investment
in
severance
would
have
to
be
paid
to
the
license.
the
original
licensee
in
this
case
was
zero,
because--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
thank
you.
