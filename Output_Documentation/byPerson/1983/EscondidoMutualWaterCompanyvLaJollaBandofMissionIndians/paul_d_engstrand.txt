mr.
paul
d.
engstrand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
an
honor
today
for
us
to
share
our
time
with
solicitor
feit
of
the
commission,
who
will
explain
why
section
4(e)
of
the
federal
power
act
does
not
give
the
secretaries
authority
to
veto
licensing
decisions
of
the
commission
by
imposing
unreasonable
conditions.
i
shall
background
the
case
and
explain
why
the
indian
bands
have
not
been
given
the
right
by
congress
to
veto
licensing
decisions
of
the
commission,
and
i
shall
discuss
why
water
rights
are
not
similar
to
reservation
lands.
in
southern
california,
between
los
angeles
and
san
diego,
at
oceanside,
the
san
luis
rey
river
empties
a
565-square
mile
watershed
into
the
pacific
ocean.
in
1895,
western
movement
pioneers
constructed
an
intake
in
a
deep
canyon
in
the
lajolla
reservation
and
a
canal
over
precipitous
mountain
terrain
to
lake
woford
near
escondido.
in
1915,
they
added
a
power
plant
at
bear
valley,
and
in
1916,
a
power
plant
at
the
rincon
site.
the
canal
and
its
works
traverses
three
indian
reservations
and
occupies
a
tiny
fraction,
less
than
1
percent
of
those
reservation
lands.
the
project...
in
1922
henshaw
dam
was
constructed,
and
later
the
canal
was
enlarged
in
order
to
convey
the
water
stored
by
the
dam
as
well
as
the
natural
flow
of
the
river
above
the
intake
and
below
the
dam.
these
physical
works
were
constructed
by
reason
of
legal
arrangements
made
with
the
bands
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
on
their
behalf
by
contracts
made
in
1894,
1914,
and
1922,
a
permit
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1908,
and
a
federal
power
commission
license
in
1924.
prior
to
1969-1970,
the
bands
or
interior
made
no
objection
to
these
works
except
by
the
filing
of
a
claim
before
the
indian
claims
commission
which
was
opposed
by
the
government.
in
1971,
escondido
sought
relicensing,
and
at
that
time
the
bands
sought
to
revoke
our
license,
sought
a
non-power
license
for
themselves.
interior
fully
support
the
bands'
position
and
even
recommended
that
the
united
states
recapture.
in
accordance
with
their
authority
under
section
e,
they
sought
to
impose
conditions
which
would
have
molded
the
project
into
a
non-power
contract
not
best
adapted
for
development
of
the
river
as
found
by
the
commission,
but
in
the
words
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
to
destroy
the
project.
interior
candidly
admits
that
it
is
not
acting
in
the
scope
of
its
role
in
the
best
interests
of
the
united
states,
but
that
it
is
totally
blinded
by
its
role
as
a
guardian
for
the
bands.
the
project
and
its
works
are
small,
on
average
14,500
acre
feet
of
water
and
four
million
kilowatt
hours
of
power
produced,
but
in
this
semi-arid
region,
the
water
is
important
and
the
power
in
these
energy-short
times
is
consequential.
the
commission
in
1979
in
two
orders
granted
a
license
jointly
to
escondido
and
vista.
petitions
for
review
were
heard
by
the
ninth
circuit,
who
reversed
and
remanded,
and
in
october
you
granted
cert.
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
benefits
of
project
176
to
be
taken
away
from
the
110,000
citizens
of
escondido
and
vista.
the
bands
bottom
their
contentions
in
notions
about
tribal
sovereignty.
but
this
is
a
false
bottom,
because
we
all
recognize
the
plenary
power
of
congress
over
these
tribal
lands,
and
we
know
that
congress
in
the
public
interest
has
long
determined
that
tribal
bands'
lands
are
frequently
necessary
for
use
by
non-tribal
interests.
congress
has
provided
for
railroads,
tramways,
canals,
reservoirs,
electric
lines,
hot
water
power
projects
to
use
tribal
lands.
we
know
that
the
broad
plan
and
purpose
of
congress
in
the
federal
power
act
was
to
centralize
and
provide
for
the
development
of
the
water
power
resources
of
the
country.
we
know
that
under
the
act
of
march
3rd,
1891,
the
general
right-of-way
statute,
congress
provided
for
the
use
of
tribal
lands
to
encourage
the
western
development.
we
know
that
under
the
mission
indian
relief
act,
mira,
congress
provided
that
canal
companies
and
citizens
could
use
tribal
lands
for
canal
right-of-ways.
the
conflict
here
before
your
honors
is,
who
did
congress
designate
as
the
final
decision-maker
about
these
tribal
lands?
i
do
not
choose
to
forsake
the
many
amici
who
have
appeared
on
our
behalf
before
your
honors
by
focusing
on
tribal
lands.
the
result
would
be
the
same
if
we
were
dealing
with
any
other
reservations,
for
if
the
commission
is
not
the
final
arbiter,
the
final
decision-maker,
then
we
will
have
to
return
to
the
same
processes
that
were
followed
before
the
turn
of
the
century,
when
special
bills
had
to
be
introduced
for
the
development
of
water
power
projects
and
use
of
tribal
lands.
the
first
hydro
plant
was
built
in
1890.
we
all
know
the
congressional
struggle
that
eventuated
in
the
1920
power
act.
in
tuscarora,
this
court
noted
that
the
congress
did
not
overlook,
did
not
exclude,
but
specifically
dealt
with
the
tribal
lands.
the
question:
who
should
be
the
final
arbiter?
the
congress
provided
in
section
3(2)
that
tribal
lands
were
to
be
covered
by
water
power
development.
section
4(e)
gave
to
the
commission
the
authority
to
license
project
works
on
tribal
lands.
we
know
that
the
senate
amendment
specifically
was
rejected
by
congress,
which
would
have
given
indians
tribal
consent
necessary.
the
congress
also
followed
the
traditional
safeguards
for
indian
lands.
in
section
4(e)
there
is
a
requirement
of
the
non-interference
finding.
in
section
10(e)
there
is
a
requirement
that
reasonable
compensation
be
paid
for
the
use
of
tribal
lands.
in
section
10(i),
where
the
commission
is
given
authority
to
waive
conditions
for
other
projects,
they
cannot
do
that
over
tribal
lands.
and
we
know
that
under
section
17(a)
they
provided
that
proceeds
from
the
compensation
for
the
use
of
tribal
lands
is
assigned
to
the
tribes
involved.
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
the
drafters
of
congressional
will
could
be
more
specific.
as
judge
leventhal
in
the
montana
power
case
said,
congress
was
aware
of
the
conflict
of
the
secretary
of
interior
between
the
landowners
of
the
tribal
lands
and
the
interests
of
licensees.
the
commission
was
meant
to
be
the
arbiter
of
the
general
interest.
if
the
commission
is
not...
decisions
are
not
final,
congress's
whole
plan
will
be
frustrated.
it
will
be
like
an
orchestra
without
strings,
like
a
baseball
team
without
a
pitcher.
tribal
consent
would
be
destructive
and
not
helpful.
mira
in
1891
provided
for
the
use
of
tribal
lands.
it
provided
in
1891
that
the
consent
of
the
tribal
bands
were
necessary,
and
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
interior,
but
three
months
later,
in
the
general
right-of-way
statute
of
march,
1891,
the
congress
provided
that
right-of-ways
could
be
given
with
only
the
requirement
from
the
secretary
of
interior.
in
1898,
the
secretary
of
interior
interpreted
this
to
apply
to
tribal
lands,
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
1914
approved
this
interpretation.
ever
since
1898,
under
the
act
of
1891,
and
under
the
1920
power
act,
the
administrative
officials
charged
with
the
responsibility
to
enforce
these
acts
have
consistently
interpreted
the
provisions
as
applying
to
tribal
lands.
and,
your
honors,
i
choose
to
reserve
five
minutes,
if
i
may,
for
closing.
mr.
paul
d.
engstrand
your
honor,
if
i
may
on
this
question
of
water
rights,
the
reason
the
land
needs
to
be
protected
is
because
of
a
physical
imposition
on
the
land.
the
reason
water
rights
need
not
be
protected
is
because
the
courts
protect
the
water
rights,
and
the
congress
said
in
section
27
that
nothing
in
the
federal
power
act
would
interfere
with
the
water
rights
given
by
the
states
for
the
control
and
use
of
water.
this
complex
arrangement
that
mr.
schulder
talked
about,
of
course,
congress
didn't
lay
that
out.
where
would
the
fact-finder
be
that
you
were
going
to
weigh
the
substantial
evidence
rule
against
if
you
don't
read
"reasonable"
in
front
of
the
word
"shall".
and
i
think
that
is
what
justice
mckinnon
said
in
lac
courte
oreilles.
he
said
that
you
must...
probably
he
was
saving
that
until
later.
it
wasn't
ripe
for
decision.
but
that
congress
must
have
meant
substantially
or
reasonable
in--
mr.
paul
d.
engstrand
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i--
mr.
paul
d.
engstrand
--yes.
i
don't
see
how
that
can
work,
like
justice
o'connor
suggested.
i
think
that
one
thing
that
is
clear
that
overrides
all
this
is
that
the
congress
was
explicit
in
the
role
the
commission
should
play
in
water
power
development.
the
congress
was
explicit
that
tribal
lands
were
to
be
available
for
water
power
projects.
the
congress
was
explicit
that
the
decision-maker
should
be
the
commission,
the
independent
body.
thank
you.
