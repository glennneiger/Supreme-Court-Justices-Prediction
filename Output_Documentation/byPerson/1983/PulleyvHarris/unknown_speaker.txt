unknown
speaker
mr.
wellington,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
if
at
some
time
you
would
explain
to
us
in
your
view
what
is
the
procedure
that
california
courts
follow
in
the
review
of
death
cases.
it
isn't
altogether
clear
to
me
precisely
what
it
is
that
the
california
courts,
the
appellate
courts
at
the
highest
level,
would
look
to.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and,
if
the
defendant
seeks
a
proportionality
review,
then
that
court
would
make
it?
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
proportionality
to
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
further
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
does
that
mean
they
do
not,
in
the
california
appellate
system,
compare
this
sentence
with
other
similar
cases
throughout
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
said
that
the
california
courts
had
started
to
do
that
after
this
case
had
been
appealed.
unknown
speaker
they
are
inaccurate
or
my
reading
of
the
opinion
is
inaccurate?
unknown
speaker
because
the
ninth
circuit
was
inaccurate
in
thinking--
unknown
speaker
--but,
the
ninth
circuit
did
think
they
were
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
is
not
a
cross-case
comparison.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wellington,
from
the
way
you
describe
the
california
court's
approach
to
proportionality
on
the
basis
of
in
re
lynch,
i
take
it
one
could
have
a
proportionality
review
of
a
50-year
jail
sentence
under
the--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
is
sollin
against
helm
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
so
you
still
have
the
constitutional
argument
to
make.
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wellington,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
didn't
even
cite
our
case
against
jurek
against
texas?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
not
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wellington,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
that?
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
is
sort
of
like
any
other
appellate
review
of
sentencing.
he
just
has
to
raise
the
question.
he
has
a
right
to
have
it
heard.
unknown
speaker
and,
he
did
not,
in
fact,
do
so
on
his
direct
appeal
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
did
he
do
so
on
his
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
it
this
way.
did
he,
in
the
state
proceeding,
raise
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
decided?
unknown
speaker
and,
did
he
get
that
proportionality
review
in
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
he
wants
this
across-the-board
review.
what
if
you
were
to
make
that
claim
right
now?
would
it
be
open
to
him?
unknown
speaker
yes.
or
must
it
be
made
on
direct
review?
that
is
the
question
i
am--
unknown
speaker
--would
he
have
waived
it
by
failing
to
request
it
on
his
direct
appeal?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
if
he
were
to
make
the
claim
for
the
first
time,
that
is
the
one
you
say
is
available
to
him
as
a
matter
of
california
law,
could
he
now
make
it?
unknown
speaker
your
kind
of
proportionality.
unknown
speaker
not
a
cross
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
any
claim
that
a
state
needs
to
look
at
all
the
cases
in
the
country.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
the
nation,
it
is
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wellington,
would
you
think
that
the
federal
constitution
might
dispense
with
this
cross-case
proportionality
review
in
a
particular
state
and
insist
that
it
be
performed
in
another
because
of
the
differences
in
the
capital
punishment
system
or
would
you
think
that
if
the
constitution
doesn't
require
this
cross-case
proportionality
in
california,
as
you
are
arguing,
it
wouldn't
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
what,
for
example,
if
it
didn't
require
it
in
texas?
would
that
mean
it
wouldn't
be
required
any
place?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
qualifying
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly.
well,
where
might
the
proportionality,
cross-case
proportionality
review
be
required?
you
were
about
to
tell
me,
weren't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
have
said
before
you
interpret
gregg
as
not
critically
depending
on
proportionality
review.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
cross-case
proportionality.
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
a
different
view
if
that
were
a
critical
part
of
gregg?
the
california
system
might
then
be
in
trouble.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
california
system
like
the
georgia
system,
more
like
georgia
than
florida?
unknown
speaker
no,
just
as
a
system
of--
unknown
speaker
--it
certainly
is
more
like
georgia
than
it
is
texas.
unknown
speaker
your
kind
of
proportionality.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
eighth
amendment
allows
or
compels?
does
the
eighth
amendment
allow
proportionality
review
or
compelled
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
is
that
a
state
constitutional
provision
which
you
refer
to
as
the
california
prohibition
against
exclusive
punishment?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
if
you
are
correct,
i
take
it
it
is
your
submission
that
the
california
law
has
changed
between
the
time
that
harris'
state
court
proceedings
took
place
and
now.
unknown
speaker
if
it
isn't
an
actual
change,
why
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
california
do
for
harris
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
for
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the
state
of
the
law
so
far
as
harris
versus
the
people
are
concerned
is
probably
best
found
in
the
case
involving
harris
versus
the
people,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
had
one
chance
and
they
have
given
no
indication
they
want
a
second
chance.
unknown
speaker
what
right
would
there
be
for
a
federal
court
in
a
habeas
case
to
send
it
back
to
a
state
court
for
a
matter
of
state
law?
none
whatever.
how
could
the
ninth
circuit
do
that
anyway
if
you
were
right?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
it,
why
were
they
passing
on
an
unexhausted
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
pretty
good
indication
that
the
california
courts
thought
that
he
was
constitutionally
punished?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
correct,
i
take
it
even
if
the
decision
we
are
arguing
about
now
were
reversed,
harris
could
go
back
into
the
california
courts
and
get
exactly
what
the
california
courts
think
he
ought
to
have.
unknown
speaker
but,
one
of
our
responsibilities,
as
well
as
to
avoid
deciding
unnecessary
constitutional
questions
ourselves,
is
to
see
that
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts
don't
unnecessarily
wallow
into
federal
constitutional
error.
and,
certainly,
if
you
are
right,
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
me
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
we
could
both
vacate
and
affirm
which
you
have
suggested
in
a
single
sentence?
unknown
speaker
what
constitutional
basis
is
there
for
that?
we
just
can't
say
we
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
look
at
this
case
again
and
stay
the
state's...
and
just
derail
the
state
system.
just
because
we
think
that
the
california
courts
made
a
state
law
mistake
or
something
we
should
send
it
back
to
them
and
stay
their...
just
stay
any
further
proceedings
against
harris?
unknown
speaker
this
is
exhausted
you
tell
us.
you
have
just
said
it
was
technically
exhausted.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state
court
refuse
to
give
relief
because
they
have
decided
that
his
conviction
and
his
sentence
are
in
accordance
with
state
law
and
the
federal
court
is
suppose
to
say
you
really
don't
understand
state
law
to
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
the
state
courts
refused
to
stay
his
execution
and
reject
any
state
law
claim,
how
can
the
federal
court
nevertheless
sustain
them
or
say
that
you
should
take
another
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
supreme
court
of
california's
decision,
what
year,
affirming
harris'
conviction?
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
when,
what
year?
unknown
speaker
how
soon
do
you
suppose
this
litigation
would
finally
become
final
if
the
courts
were
to
follow
your
suggestion?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question?
i
am
still
somewhat
puzzled.
in
his
collateral
proceeding
in
the
state
court,
did
he
raise
the
across-the-board
proportionality
review
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
he
lost
in
that
case,
including
in
the
california
supreme
court,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but,
they
had
an
opportunity
in
that
proceeding
to
do
precisely
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
now
said
they
should
do.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
amsterdam,
is
it
not
true
that
california
law
had
so
evolved
by
september
of
1982,
which
is
when...
no,
march
of
1982,
wasn't
it,
that
they
denied
the...
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
collateral
review?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
for
there
to
be
a
change
it
has
to
be
after
the
denial
of
collateral
review
for
it
to
be
relevant,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
ought
to
get
another
crack
at
reading
what
it
does
or
what
it
might
read
into
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
about
whether
cross-case
proportionality
review
is
constitutionally
required?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
didn't
the...
isn't
there
substantial
indication
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
there
is
a
federal
constitutional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
california
courts
would
do
in
the
face
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
going
to
send
it
back
to
the
california
courts,
in
the
face
of
this
holding
by
the
ninth
circuit,
what
do
you
think
the
california
courts
would
do?
i
mean
they
might
feel
compelled
to
give
them
proportionality
review
even
if
it
wasn't
required
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
you
argued--
unknown
speaker
--cross-case
proportionality.
unknown
speaker
just
what
do
you
mean
by
a
comparable
case?
i
think
you
used
that
term.
what
elements
must
be
the
same?
must
the
victim
be
the
same
age
or
approximately
the
same
age,
must
the
murder
have
been
committed
in
the
same
way,
the
events
after
the
murder,
must
they
all
be
compared?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
do
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
enough
for
you
if
instead
of
calling
up
on
the
record
all
the
cases,
the
judges
just
said
we
have
a
firm
conviction,
having
seen
all
these
cases,
that
the
death
penalty
conforms
to
the
norm
here?
that
is
all
they
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
we
have...
all
these
cases
comes
before
us
and
we
have
the
general
impression
now
and
conviction
that
this
sentence
is
not
out
of
line
or
would
they
have
to
go
through
the
whole
litany,
this
case,
that
case?
unknown
speaker
they
just
do
it
by
memory.
they
don't
go
back
to
the
records
and
look
at
them
all
again,
they
just
do
it
by
memory.
they
say
we
have
seen
all
these
cases
and
this
case
just
isn't
out
of
line.
unknown
speaker
mr.
amsterdam,
if
they
must
do
something,
it
is
not
enough
to
rely
on
their
memory.
you
say
they
must
look
at
the
cases
to
which
counsel
calls
to
their
attention.
did
counsel
in
this
case
call
any
court's
attention
to
other
cases
similar
to
this?
unknown
speaker
is
that
petition
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
is
that
petition
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
federal
habeas
petition,
does
that
have
the
same
kind
of
showing
in
it?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
that
before
us?
unknown
speaker
is
that
material
here
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
record
now
before
this
court?
