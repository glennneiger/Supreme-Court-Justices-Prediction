mr.
michael
d.
wellington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
the
ten-year
effort
on
the
part
of
the
states
to
establish
constitutionally
valid
death
penalty
laws.
harris
was
tried
under
california's
1977
statute
enacted
in
response
to
this
court's
series
of
decisions
in
the
gregg
series
of
cases.
and,
his
claims
that
the
california's
statute
was
unconstitutional,
in
part
because
its
perceived
lack
of
proportionality
review
had
been
denied
at
all
state
levels.
his
direct
appeal
was
affirmed
and
his
habeas
corpus
petition
was
narrowly
denied
by
the
california
supreme
court
which,
at
that
point,
vacated
its
stay
of
execution
and
essentially
remitted
him
to
the
executioner.
the
united
states
district
court
also
denied
habeas
corpus
relief,
holding,
as
the
california
courts
had,
that
proportionality
review,
at
least
as
envisioned
by
harris,
was
not
demanded
by
the
federal
constitution.
after
the
district
court
denied
relief,
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
issued
the
ruling
that
we
are
concerned
with
here,
ruling
that
this
court's
decisions
in
gregg
and
in
proffitt
commanded
the
conducting
of
a
proportionality
review
by
the
state,
essentially
commanding
a
comparative
proportionality
review,
and
also
holding
that
the
california
courts
had
on
their
own
required
the
holding
of
a
proportionality
review.
now,
we
sought
cert.
from
the
ninth
circuit
holding
to
clarify,
and
in
my
view,
correct
the
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
gregg
cases
required
proportionality
review.
and
specifically
to
correct
the
holding
that
california
cannot
execute
mr.
harris
until
that
review
has
been
conducted.
there
are
four
points
that
i
am
hoping
to
raise
here
today.
the
first
one,
in
response
to
professor
amsterdam's
invitation
to
this
court
to
not
decide
the
issue,
i
am
going
to
urge
that
the
issue
must
be
decided
on
the
merits.
second,
i
wish
to
address
the
concept
of
proportionality
and
what
that
term
means
in
this
case
and
to
urge
that
proportionality
in
this
context
means
precisely
what
this
court
said
that
it
means
at
the
end
of
last
term
in
sollin
v.
helm
and
in
some
previous
cases
this
court
has
decided.
the
third
point
that
i
am
hoping
to
reach
is
the
question
of
what
review
is
necessary
on
the
issue
of
proportionality
and
i
am
going
to
urge
that
the
review
of
that
issue
is
no
different
than
the
review
commanded
of
any
other
constitutional
issue;
that
is
it
is
an
issue
that
should
be
addressed
by
the
court
if
raised
by
counsel,
if
raised
by
the
parties,
if
raised
on
a
supportive
record.
and,
finally,
i
am
going
to
urge
that
this
court
should
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
that
death
for
personally
and
intentionally
inflicted
murder
is
not
disproportionate,
something
the
court
has
come
very
close
to
doing
on
two
prior
occasions.
now,
i
would
like
to
begin--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--certainly,
justice
o'connor.
under
the
california
statutes,
every
death
sentence
is
automatically
appealed
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
that
court
reviews
any
contentions
of
error
raised
by
the
defendant,
the
appellant,
in
that
court.
that
is
the
scope
of
review
in
that
court.
essentially,
it
is
the
same
as
with
any
other
appeal
to
the
california
supreme
court
with
the
one
exception
that
in
death-sentence
cases
each
death-sentence
defendant
has
an
automatic
right
to
have
his
issues
heard
by
the
california
supreme
court.
so,
the
court
reviews
the
issues
that
are
raised
by
the
parties,
raised
by
the
defendants.
that
is
what
happened
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor...
i
am
saying
that
in
essence
and
perhaps
i
had
best
step
back
just
for
a
second
to
explain
what
i
perceive
proportionality
review
to
be,
to
explain
how
the
california
courts
are
constituted
to
give
it
and
has
been
giving
it,
in
fact,
where
it
has
been
asked
for.
that
is
that
i
say
proportionality
review
is
an
addressing
by
either
the
california
supreme
court
or
this
court
in
an
appropriate
case
of
the
proportionality
of
the
sentence
actually
meted
out
by
the
sentencing
authority
and
that
review--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--proportionality
in
the
way
this
court
defined
proportionality
last
term
in
sollin
v.
helm
which
includes,
your
honor
an
examination
of
whether
it
is
proportional
to
the
crime.
one
of
the
points
i
made
in
my
brief,
and
i
think
it
is
crucial
to
this
decision,
is
that
proportionality
as
this
court
defined
it
very
carefully
last
term
and
as
this
court
has
used
the
concept
in
its
previous
cases,
endman
v.
florida
and
coker
v.
georgia,
is
exactly,
precisely
the
same
proportionality
analysis
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
used
for
over
a
decade,
first
announced
in
the
early
'70's
in
in
re
lynch.
it
uses
precisely
the
same
three
steps,
even
announced
in
precisely
the
same
order
as
this
court
has.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
not
on
what
professor
amsterdam
has
called
a
cross-case
comparative
basis,
your
honor.
the
primary
distinction,
i
believe,
between
the
kind
of
proportionality
analysis
that
harris
is
urging
and
that
that
we
are
urging
is
that...
and,
the
ninth
circuit,
of
course,
agreed
with
harris'
position,
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
position
involves
an
examination
of
all
of
the
aspects
of
each
case,
all
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
of
the
case
before
the
court,
compared
them
with
all
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
with
every
other...
either
every
other
death
penalty
case
or,
under
some
argument,
every
other
death
eligible
case
that
has
arisen
in
the
state
since
the
drafting
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
inaccurate,
your
honor.
that
is
inaccurate.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
the
california
courts
have
not--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
apparent
from
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
the
ninth
circuit
read
two
california
supreme
court
cases,
frierson
and
jackson,
to
constitute
a
promise
by
the
state
of
california
to
conduct
proportionality
review.
i
do
not
see
any
reasonable
reading
of
either
frierson
or
jackson
that
says
that.
what
frierson
and
jackson
actually
said
is
three
things,
in
fact,
when
addressed
with
the
question...
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
required
proportionality
review
and
whether
the
california
statute
was
unconstitutional
for
its
failure
to
include
the
proportionality
review.
the
california
supreme
court
said
first
that
they
do
not
read
the
majority
of
the
justices'
opinions
in
gregg
to
require
the
proportionality
review.
second,
that,
nonetheless,
under
california
law,
a
disproportionate
sentence
would
constitute
error
and
what
they
referred
to
as
well
established
proportionality
principles,
reference
to
the
lynch
case,
they
were
fully
capable
of
addressing
the
issue
of
proportionality
and
that
they
had
recognized
in
the
past
that
that
was
part
of
california's
jurisprudence.
an
examination
of
california
supreme
court
cases,
both
death
penalty
cases
and
non-death
penalty
cases,
makes
it
absolutely
apparent
that
they
do
not
conduct
that
review
automatically
in
each
case.
they
conduct
the
review
when
the
issue
is
raised.
and,
they
don't
conduct
that
review
on
this
cross-case
comparative
basis
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
harris
have
urged,
rather
just
as
this
court
decided
last
year
in
sollin.
it
is
an
examination
of
broader
factual
questions,
types
of
cases,
categories
of
crime.
i
think
the
essential
point
is
that
the
lynch
test,
which
was
adopted
as
to
capital
punishment
in
the
frierson
and
jackson
cases
is
precisely
the
same
three-step
test
that
this
court
established
last
term
in
sollin
v.
helm.
so,
returning
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
what
does
the
california
court
do,
the
california
court
provides
a
death
sentence
to
defendant
with
a
very
clear
three-step
test
as
to
what
proportionality
constitutes,
precisely
the
same
three-step
test
that
this
court
has
provided
death
sentence
defendants
nationwide.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
cross-case
comparative
analysis.
it
is...
i
prefer
frankly
not
to
use
the
term
"proportionality
review",
because
it
implies
some
special
kind
of
hearing.
it
is
a
review
of
the
question
of
the
issue
of
proportionality,
no
different,
except
for
the
substantive
issue
itself,
no
different
than
a
review
of
the
voluntariness
of
confessions.
if
the
defendant
has
a
case,
he
raises
the
issue
and
the
court
addresses
it.
so,
that
was
offered,
your
honor,
to
mr.
harris
in
this
case.
as
the
appeal
was
pending
before
the
california
supreme
court,
as
the
briefs
were
being
written,
the
frierson
case
expressly
applied
the
eight-year
old,
at
that
time,
lynch
test
to
capital
punishment,
applied
to
this
growing
issue
of
proportionality
review,
inviting,
it
would
seem
to
me,
mr.
harris
to
raise
the
issue
of
proportionality
if
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
his
sentence
was
in
any
way
disproportionate.
although
frierson
was
discussed
in
harris'
case,
in
his
brief--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
proportionality
analysis
from
lynch
from
had
been
applied
typically
to
non-death
cases
until
frierson
and
jackson,
at
which
point
the
court
made
it
clear
that
that
same
test
was
applicable
to
death
cases.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken
very
briefly
is
that
this
court
has
already
ruled
on
the
issue
of
proportionality
review
and
the
only
language
on
point,
the
only
language
in
the
entire
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
that
addresses
the
federal
constitution
issue
is
the
notation
that
the
california
court
gave
no
indication
that
it
had
provided
the
proportionality
review
required
by
gregg
and
proffitt.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
certainly
not
in
what
could
be
called
the
holding,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
it
was
cited
in
the
opinion,
but--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--that
is
right,
notwithstanding
my
repeated
argument
that
jurek
stands
for
the
proposition
that
no
such
proportionality
review
is
required.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary,
given
the
time
given
in
the
brief
for
the
issue,
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
over
the
gregg,
proffitt,
and
jurek
cases
here.
the
point
that
i
have
that
i
think
is
clear
is
that
this
court
did
not
in
those
cases
demand
proportionality
review
as
part
of
the
death
sentence.
that
is
the
issue
here.
all
this
court
did
in
those
cases
is
approve,
once
they
had
proportionality
review
as
apart
of
its
statutory
system,
approve
one
state,
florida,
which
the
supreme
court
has
said
it
would
conduct
a
proportionality
review
exactly
the
same
way
california
has
and
reading
of
the
florida
cases
shows
that
sometimes
they
examine
proportionality,
sometimes
they
don't
examine
proportionality.
they,
like
california,
address
the
question
when
it
is
raised.
of
course,
there
is
texas
which
has
no
such
provision
at
all.
i
think
it
is
important
in
looking
at
the
constitutional
eighth
amendment
question
here
to
draw
the
strong
distinction
between
cross-case
analysis
and
what
i
would
refer
to
as
review
of
proportionality.
this
court's
decisions,
the
furman
decision
and
the
gregg
decision,
have
expressed
a
very
strong
concern
about
the
issue
of
arbitrariness.
the
procedures
that
were
referred
to
in
the
gregg
series
of
cases
whereby
it
would
be
ensured
that
a
jury,
a
sentencing
jury,
or
any
sentencing
authority
would
be
given
fully
informed,
guided
discretion
in
their
decision,
was
designed
to
ensure
a
freedom...
a
system
designed
to
be
free
from
arbitrariness.
that
was
the
focus
of
those
cases,
a
concern
that
the
petitions
be
free
of
arbitrariness.
that
is
not
all,
however,
that
this
court
has
provided
for
that
area.
in
addition
to
requiring
the
states
to
establish
a
system,
a
statutory
system
designed
to
avoid
arbitrariness,
there
is
the
separate
issue
of
proportionality
that
this
court
has
discussed
for
almost
a
century
since
the
weems
case
and
most
recently
in
the
context
of
the
death
penalty
has
discussed
in
the
coker
versus
georgia
case,
endman
versus
florida,
and
last
term
i
think
most
clearly
coalesced
in
the
sollin
v.
helm
case.
the
court
has
said
that
no
matter
what
the
statutory
system
is,
no
matter
how
well
defined
it
is,
there
still
must
be
a
proportionality
to
the
judgment,
even
if
they
are
a
result
of
a
presumptively
valid
system.
they
must
be
proportional,
and
if,
as
is
the
case
in
the
death
sentence
for
rape
in
coker
and
in
the
death
sentence
for
a
non-personally
committed,
non-intentional
murder
in
endman,
if
they
are
disproportionate,
then
that
has
to
be
a
way
to
review
that.
california
has
no
argument
with
that.
california
has
used
that
standard
for
over
a
decade.
what
california
urges
is
that
it
must
be
the
kind
of
review
that
this
court
discussed
in
helm
for
a
couple
of
very
good
reasons.
one
has
to
do
with
the
traditional--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
we
broke
at
noon
i
was
beginning
my
examination
of
the
eighth
amendment
argument
on
the
question
of
proportionality
review.
i
think
the
most
useful
way
to
approach
the
issue
is
to
begin
with
a
look
at
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
furman
and
gregg
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
and
that
is
arbitrariness
and
i
believe
that
all
of
the
arguments
having
to
do
with
the
question
of
proportionality
and
whatever
particular
brand
of
that
applies
here
are
really
addressed
to
the
question
of
controlling
arbitrariness.
the
court
in
gregg
established
procedures
which
states
have
followed
to
ensure
against
arbitrariness,
but
the
idea
of
proportionality
is
essentially
intended
as
a
second
line
of
defense
in
the
individual
case
against
the
possibility
of
an
arbitrary
result
being
produced
by
one
of
the
state
systems.
unless
we
are
to
have
two
very
different
constitutional
motions
of
proportionality
that
this
court
announced
in
the
helm
case
last
term
and
some
new
one
to
be
announced
applicable
to
death
penalty
cases,
then
i
think
we
have
to
rely
on
what
this
court
has
said
in
helm,
which
was
based
on
the
state
work
done
earlier
in
both
coker
and
in
endman,
which
is
precisely
the
same
sort
of
proportionality
that
the
state
of
california
has
offered
its
death
sentence
defendants,
and,
in
fact,
all
defendants
for
well
over
a
decade.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
he
did
not.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
he
did
not
address
the
issue
of
the
proportionality
of
his
sentence
as
the
california
supreme
court
has
envisioned
proportionality
and
as
this
court
has
envisioned
proportionality.
there
was
an
allegation
among
the
cloud
of
allegations
in
his
petition
that
the
california
statute...
they
operated
arbitrarily
in
that
some
others
have
been
spared
under
circumstances
no
less
deserving
of
the
death
penalty
than
mr.
harris'
petition.
that
is
not
the
consideration
that
this
court
has
announced--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--he
did
demand
a
proportionality
review
and
to
the
extent...
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
he
had
a
right
to,
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
he
did
not
get
the
proportionality
review
he
demanded,
your
honor.
the
distinction
has
to
be
drawn.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
because
there
is
no
right
to
it
under
state
law
or
under
the
federal
constitution,
your
honor.
what
i
am
urging
is
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
court
consider
a
claim
that
a
particular
sentence
is
disproportionate
under
the
terms
of
california
and
federal
cases.
that
claim
was
not
made.
mr.
harris
has
never
said
that
his
sentence
was
disproportionate
in
the
terms
that
that
word
is
used,
that
phrase
is
used
under
california
cases
and
the
federal
constitutional
cases.
he
has
only
said
i
want
my
review,
i
want
the
wheels
to
spin.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
would
it
be
open
to
him?
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
am
not
arguing
that
harris
has
waived.
it
seems
to
me
under--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--it
is
not
clear,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
he
could.
i
believe
that
under
the
california
habeas
corpus
system
he
would
be
empowered
to
file
another
petition.
what
he
would
have
to
do
is
convince
the
court
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
made
of
disproportionality
so
that
a
writ
would
be
granted.
he
still
has
the
statutory
power
to
file
another
writ.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
not
a
cross
case
of
proportionality
unless,
of
course,
he
has
some
authority
for
that
by
that
time.
that
is
what
i
am
here,
of
course,
trying
to
avoid.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
look
at
why
the
cross
case
comparative
proportionality
review
is
a
terrible
constitutional
idea
and
it
is
so
for
practical
reasons
as
well
as
theoretical
ones.
the
proportionality
review
this
court
has
talked
about
in
sollin
is
something
the
courts
can
do.
it
involves
an
examination
of
broad
range
of
human
behavior,
rape
of
an
adult
woman,
murder
committed
by
someone
who
wasn't
there
and
didn't
intend
murder.
and,
it
involves
an
examination
of
how
such
broad
ranges
of
conduct
are
treated
by
the
legislatures
and
by
the
courts.
the
cross-case
comparative
review
that
harris
and
the
ninth
circuit
speak
of,
if
it
is
to
be
done
as
it
is
clearly
intended,
every
factor
that
may
be
legitimately
constitutionally
considered
by
a
jury
would
have
to
be
cranked
into
that
analysis.
the
courts,
the
tort
courts
that
conducted
this
review
would
have
to
consider
the
entire
range
of
considerations
justifiably
before
a
jury.
i
would
urge
that
is
simply
not
possible.
i
would
urge
two
things.
it
is
simply
not
possible
for
any
one
court
to
compare
the
hundreds
of
cases
that
would
be
before
them,
some...
for
this
court
to
do
it,
some
1200
nationwide
in
all
of
their
particulars.
it
would
be
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
language,
justice
powell's
language,
writing
for
the
majority
in
sollin,
where
the
court
said
that
absent
some
specific
authority,
it
is
not
the
role
of
the
appellate
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
sentencing
courts
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
a
particular
sentence.
if
we
are
to
look
at
all
of
the
factors
that
go
into
a
sentencing
authority's
determination
to
condemn
a
man,
then
necessarily,
unavoidably,
the
court
doing
that
is
going
to
wind
up
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
sentencing
authority.
that
is
something
that
is
not
only
as
a
practical
matter
impossible,
it
goes
far
beyond
what
appellate
courts
are
constituted
to
do,
far
beyond
what
this
court
has
set
its
rule
out
to
be
with
regard
to
the
state
sentencing
courts.
this
court's
role
has
been
announced
in
its
proportionality
cases
and
is
to
examine
the
broad
limits
within
which
a
jury's
discretion
is
to
operate.
that
is
exactly
what
the
sollin
case,
what
the
coker
case,
and
the
endman
case
do.
it
examines
broad
limits
and
expressly
returns
to
the
jury
or
leaves
with
the
jury
the
power
and
even
the
obligation
to
operate
using
its
own
judgment
within
those
limits.
to
give
you
an
idea
of
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
a
court
to
exercise
this
sort
of
cross-case
analysis,
two
facts
which
continually
strike
me
about
this
case
would
have
to
be
considered.
there
is
the
picture
that
remains
so
strongly
with
me
of
robert
harris,
after
killing
these
two
teenaged
boys,
sitting
down
eating
their
hamburgers
and
laughing
at
his
younger
brother
for
not
having
the
stomach
to
do
the
same
thing.
that
is
something
properly
committed
to
the
jury,
that
picture,
their
making
their
own
decision
as
to
what
kind
of
person
is
this
and
what
kind
of
judgment
should
be
handed
down
with
regard
to
him.
there
is
the
picture
of
robert
harris
flicking
a
bit
of
flesh
off
the
end
of
his
pistol
and
laughing
about
how
he
sure
blew
that
blonde
boy's
brains
out.
that
is
properly
commended
to
the
jury
for
their
consideration
on
the
issue
of
death.
but,
if
we
are
to
do
a
cross-case
analysis
of
all
death
penalty
cases
in
the
nation,
some
court
is
going
to
have
to
find
a
way
to
assign
a
qualitative
value
to
those--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--i
am
sorry.
well,
speaking
just
within
a
state,
the
california
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--would
have
to
look--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--although
the
issue
specifically
in
this
case
is
that,
your
honor,
and
yet,
as
this
court
has
applied
proportionality,
proportionality
analysis,
it
has
done
the
analysis
on
a
nationwide
basis.
so,
it
certainly
could
be
extended
to
the
nation.
but,
looking
just
at
the
california
supreme
court's
obligation
as
it
is
envisioned
by
the
ninth
circuit,
they
would
have
to
look
at
those
two
factors,
those
two
factual
matters,
as
well
as
the
hundreds
of
others
presented
in
a
case,
find
some
way
to
compare
them
in
their
own
minds,
in
their
own
hearts,
with
matters
just
as
horrible
but
quite
different
in
another
case.
there
is
no
other
case
in
california,
probably
not
in
the
nation,
that
featured
facts
of
the
type,
of
the
two
types
i
just
mentioned,
and
the
facts
in
this
case
would
deal
with
several
of
those,
but
there
is
no
other
case
that
has
exactly
that
sort
of
behavior.
so,
doing
a
cross-case
analysis
is
going
to
have
to
have
find
some
way
to
assign
like
a
number
value
to
those
kinds
of
facts
that
then
compares
to
the
number
value
assigned
to
the
parade
of
horribles
in
some
other
case
to
judge
the
jury's
determination.
this
is
not
the
way
this
court
has
operated
with
juries.
i
would
urge
that
this
is
not
the
way
the
federal
constitution
envisions
any
court
operating
with
juries.
what
happens
in
the
death-sentencing
process
is,
in
my
view,
a
very
spiritual
determination
is
made
by
whatever
body,
whether
it
be
a
judge
sitting
as
a
sentencing
authority
or
whether
it
be
the
jury.
a
very
spiritual
decision
is
made
as
to
this
individual,
guided
by
the
information
and
the
statutory
guidance
within
a
state.
that
decision
holds
within
itself
all
of
the
factors,
all
of
the
factors.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
if
it
does
not
require
it
in
california,
your
honor,
it
does
not
require
it
anywhere
with
one
exception.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely,
your
honor,
unless...
there
are
two
unlesses
there.
i
need
to
do
two
caveats
to
that.
unless
a
court
were
to
find
a
state
that
did
not
provide
the
assurances
against
arbitrariness
that
the--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--well,
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
was
hoping
to,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
can
imagine
a
court
finding
that
a
state
did
not
meet
the
gregg
requirements
of
informed,
guided
discretion
and
concluding
that
nonetheless,
because
it
had
a
cross-case
comparative
approach
that
might
counterbalance
the
deficit.
however,
in
a
case
like
california,
which
clearly
meets
the
requirements
set
out
in
gregg,
the
informed,
guided
discretion--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
think
perhaps
not,
your
honor,
because
the--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--well,
there
is
proffitt
and
there
is
jurek
decided
at
the
same
time.
jurek,
of
course,
has
not
only
no
cross-case
analysis,
it
has
no
indication
there
is
any
proportionality
review
at
all.
proffitt--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--as
to
proportionality
review,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
yes,
in--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--i
would
say
so,
yes.
i
think
that
is
clearly
so,
your
honor,
although
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
system
in
texas,
involving
answering
the
three
questions,
can
be
seen
as
providing
far
fewer
safeguards
than
the
california
system.
the
california
system
at
the
very
least
provides
the
safeguards
the
florida
system
does
and
the
proportionality
review,
the
machinery
for
reviewing
proportionality
in
california
is
certainly
as
efficacious
as
that
in
florida.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
my
kind
of
proportionality.
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
i
think
that...
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
look
at
the
role
of
the
jury
as
this
court
has
envisioned
it
in
death
penalty
cases
as
expressing
the
conscience
of
the
community
and--
mr.
michael
d.
wellington
--thank
you,
your
honor.
