mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
just
like
to
make
three
points
to
the
court
this
afternoon
in
response
to
mr.
wellington's
argument.
first,
i
should
like
to
explain
why
i
disagree
with
mr.
wellington's
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
and
justice
stevens'
question
as
to
what
california
law
is
and
why
i
believe
that
california
law
may
well
offer
all
of
the
proportionality
review
that
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
and
more.
california
law
in
short
is
not
limited
to
sollin
v.
helm.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
this
court's
decisions
plainly
imply,
if
they
do
not
already
squarely
held,
that
federal
eighth
amendment
review
is
also,
in
death
cases,
not
limited
to
sollin
v.
helm.
and,
finally,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
any
question
as
to
what
harris
asked
for
in
the
state
courts
to
demonstrate
that
he
has
asked
in
the
state
courts
for
exactly
the
kind
of
proportionality
review
that
california
law
does,
in
fact,
allow
and
that
we
urge
the
eighth
amendment
allows.
i
will
then
ask
that
the
judgment
below
for
those
reasons
be
affirmed.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
eighth
amendment
compels,
california
law
allows
eighth
amendment
review,
proportionality
review.
let
me
start
with
california
law
and
then
i
will
move
to
the
eighth
amendment.
the
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
about
california
law
is
that
it
is
in
evolution,
that
none
of
us
is
very
sure
at
the
moment
exactly
what
california
law
does
provide
or
what
the
california
supreme
court
does
do.
in
lynch,
the
california
supreme
court
announced
a
decision
which
was
quite
like
this
court's
decision
in
sollin
v.
helm.
however,
as
the
california
cases,
which
are
collected
in
our
brief
in
note
18
at
pages
32
to
33
indicate,
california
has
gone
well
beyond
that.
the
rodriguez,
for
example,
holds
that
22
years
imprisonment
for
a
child
molester
is
clear
and
unusual
punishment
because
it
is
disproportionate
under
california
law,
something
i
suggest
goes
rather
well
beyond
sollin
v.
helm.
moreover,
in
a
case
which
was
decided
since
we
filed
our
brief,
although
it
is
cited
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
34,
which
is
people
v.
dillon,
the
california
supreme
court
reduced
a
first
degree
murder
conviction
to
second
degree
murder
because
it
violated
the
california
prohibition
against
excessive
punishments.
it
was
clearly
first
degree
murder
within
the
statute.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
state.
the
california
clear
or
unusual
punishment
clause,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
dillon
case,
the
defendant
was
clearly
within
the
first
degree
murder
statute.
it
was
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
robbery.
moreover,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
defendant
had
killed
intentionally
which
was
why
it
reduced
this
punishment
to
second
degree,
which
in
california
is
intentional
murder.
now,
we
have
an
intentional
killing,
one,
i
might
add,
which
was
done
by
nine
bullet
wounds
in
the
course
of
a
robbery.
and,
the
california
supreme
court,
which
could
have
held
that
that
punishment
was
not
excessive,
indeed,
which
could
have
held
under
this
court's
decision
in
gregg,
that
the
death
penalty
was
not
excessive
for
an
intentional
killing,
went
ahead
and
reduced
under
california
law
the
sentence
of
life
imprisonment,
and,
indeed,
reduced
the
degree
of
offense
from
first
degree
murder
to
second
degree
murder.
now,
to
come
to
justice
stevens'
question
and
a
question
justice
white
has
also
been
asking,
what
about
cross-case
review.
there
is
the
beginning
of
that
in
dillon.
dillon
finds
that
the
death
penalty
was
excessive...
excuse
me,
that
the
first
degree
murder
conviction
and
a
life
sentence
was
excessive
on
the
facts
of
the
dillon
case
largely
because
of
individual
characteristics
of
the
defendant.
but,
the
court
adds,
and
i
am
now
reading
from
194
california
reporter,
at
page
420,
"finally,
the
excessiveness
of
defendant's
punishment
is
underscored
by
the
petty
chastisement
handed
out
to
the
six
other
youths
who
participated
with
him
in
the
same
offenses.
"
although
this
was
a
conspiracy
to
commit
robbery
and
a
murder
in
the
course
of
it
and
all
of
the
coparticipants
were
guilty
of
robbery
and
murder
under
california
law,
the
court
says
the
one
member
of
the
gang
who
was
an
adult
was
allowed
to
plead
no
contest
to
charges
of
conspiracy
to
commit
robbery
and
all
of
the
other
minors
were
simply
made
wards
of
the
court.
says
the
court
in
short
defendant
received
the
heaviest
penalty
provided
by
law
while
those
jointly
responsible
with
him
received
the
lightest,
the
proverbial
slap
on
the
wrist.
now,
of
course,
this
is
not
cross-case
comparison
in
the
sense
of
some
other
murder
case,
but
it
is
a
beginning
of
comparing
the
death
sentence
with
other
sentences,
those
meted
out
to
dillon's
accomplices
in
this
offense.
moreover,
in
the
dillon
case,
in
a
footnote,
26...
again,
i
am
referring
to
194
california
reporter
at
413,
footnote
26,
the
court
cites
with
approval
california
court
of
appeals
cases,
including
the
keogh
case
and
the
vargas
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
footnote
18.
the
keogh
case
does
exactly
what
justice
stevens
and
justice
white
have
been
asking
about.
it
engages
in
cross-case
comparison.
keogh
involved
a
sentence
of
four
consecutive
sentences
for
forgery
as
a
result
of
which
the
defendant
ended
up
with
a
64-year
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
jefferson,
looked
at
the
median
term
of
imprisonment
served
by
forgers
in
california,
found
that
few
of
them
went
to
jail
at
all
and
when
they
did
it
was
for
22
to
24
months,
and
on
that
kind
of
a
comparison
proceeded
to
invalidate,
again,
justice
rehnquist,
under
the
california
cruel
or
unusual
punishment
clause,
the
lynch
clause,
the
punishment
imposed
on
keogh.
now,
i
think
it
is
indisputable
that
california
law
goes
well
beyond
sollin
v.
helm.
it
goes
beyond,
although
it
is
in
evolution
and
it
is
unclear
exactly
how
far
it
has
gone
so
far,
it
goes
beyond
anything
that
we
need
to
ask
for
in
order
to
get
the
relief
that
we
have
requested
in
this
case
which
is
to
have
the
california
supreme
court
compare
other
death
sentences
and
life
sentences
in
comparable
cases
with
harris.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
sure
i
recall
that
it
changed.
there
is
an
evolution
of
the
lynch
doctrine,
like
any
doctrine
which
starts
out
with
a
principle
and
then
evolves--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--i
have
no
idea.
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
only
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
take
the
case
back
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
then
they
will
have
a
chance
to
take
a
look
at
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
entirely
true.
they
have
had
one
chance.
there
has
been
no
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
proportionality
review
issue.
the
ninth
circuit
below
squarely
found,
and
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
question,
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
not,
on
the
merits,
given
harris
proportionality
review.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
is
no...
the
reason
for
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
there
are
three
other
claims
in
this
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
has
sent
back
to
the
federal
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
that
ruling
has
not
been
challenged
in
this
court
by
california.
the
question
of
why
it
should
go
back
to
state
court
is
why
any
unexhausted
federal
habeas
petition
goes
back
to
state
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
ninth
circuit?
if
this
is
an
unexhausted
claim
in
your
view,
why
did
the
ninth
circuit
consider
it
at
all?
because
there
is--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--perhaps
i
misspoke
myself
when
i
said
an
unexhausted
claim.
technically
it
is
exhausted
under
the
technical
rule
of
roberts
v.
lavallee.
we
have
been
into
the
state
courts.
and
even
though,
as
your
honor
points
out,
state
law
changed
under
roberts,
we
are
still
technically
exhausted.
why
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
the
claim
was
that
the
california
courts
had
all
refused
to
stay
harris'
execution.
he
was
due
to
die--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--no,
i
don't
think
that
is
so.
i
think
that
this
case,
in
effect,
slipped
between
the
cogs
in
the
california
court
system.
harris'
brief
in
the
california
supreme
court
was
filed
before
the
california
supreme
court
had
decided
in
the
jackson
case
that
proportionality
review
was
required.
frierson
preceded
the
filing
of
harris'
brief,
but
frierson
was
only
a
minority
opinion
on
the
question
of
requiring
a
proportionality
review.
after
harris'
brief
was
filed,
jackson
was
decided.
the
proportionality
requirement
of
frierson
became
a
majority
requirement,
and
then
harris'
case
was
simply
dealt
with
by
saying
we
dealt
with
all
these
issues
in
jackson.
there
was
no
look
on
the
facts
of
this
case
at
any
question
of
whether
harris'
penalty
fit
his
crime.
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
see
what
the
california
courts
did
was
to
see
what
they
said.
the
california
opinion
in
harris'
case
says
at
the
beginning,
we
find
no
merit
in
any
of
these
claims,
but
since
this
is
a
death
case,
we
are
going
to
talk
about
all
of
the
issues
we
are
to
decide.
then
it
goes
ahead
an
decides
15
distinct
questions,
none
of
which
have
anything
to
do
with
the
fitness
of
the
death
sentence.
i
think
it
is
inconceivable,
reading
an
opinion
like
that,
to
say
that
the
california
courts,
in
fact,
gave
harris
proportionality
review.
now,
there
is...
whether
because
the
law
has
changed
or
is
changing,
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
has
been
an
evolution
over
the
course
of
the
term
that
harris
has
been
in
the
courts
in
california
law.
at
the
moment,
we
believe
that
the
latest
pronouncements
of
the
california
supreme
court
suggests
that
it
is
at
least
very
likely
that
california
law
allows
harris
to
review
his--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--agreed.
and,
the
only
question,
therefore,
is
whether
a
federal
stay
of
execution
should
remain
in
effect
while
he
does
so
and
that
is
the
only
effect
of
the
decision
below.
the
decision
below
does
nothing
more
than
send
him
back
to
the
california
courts
and
that
is
why
we
have
been
urging
that
it
stands
rose
v.
lundy
on
its
head,
it
stands
this
court's
usual
reluctance
to
reach
federal
constitutional
questions
unnecessarily
on
its
head,
for
this
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
eighth
amendment
issue
when
two
things
are
true.
one,
california
law
may
give
harris
what
he
wants,
and,
two,
the
only
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
send
him
back
to
that
court
to
ask
the
court
to
keep
him
alive.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
would
have--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--we
would
have
no
problem
if
this
court
were
to
vacate
the
ground
of
decision
below,
say
that
there
is
no
need
to
reach
an
eighth
amendment
question
in
this
case
because
california
law
is
still
unclear
and
affirm
the
decision
below
on
the
ground
that
the
only
relief
given
in
fact
below
was
to
say
that
the
california
court
had
to
take
a
look
at
this
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
only
effect
of
the
judgment
below
is
to
give
interim
relief
while
harris
proceeds
to--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--well,
in
non-death
cases,
if
an
unexhausted
petition
is
filed,
the
appropriate
disposition
of
it--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--it
is
technically
exhausted,
but
the
policies
behind
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
which
are
that
if
the
state
court
may
still
give
relief
in
this
case,
it
makes
no
sense
for
the
federal
courts
to
go
jumping
in
with
both
feet.
those
policies
still
apply.
now,
in
a
non-death
case,
the
effect
of
the
application
of
those
policies
would
be
to
give
no
relief
and
simply
say
to
the
prisoner
go
back
to
state
court.
in
a
death
case,
however,
where
the
state
courts
refuse
to
stay
execution
and
it
is
imminent,
the
federal
courts
may
act
and
here
is
the
jurisdictional
reason--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--the
federal
court
would
only
act
if
there
was
a
viable
federal
issue
and
the
only
reason
why
it
would
act
is
to
say
we
are
not
ready
to
reach
that
issue
because
there
are
still
state
issues
that
may
resolve
this
case.
and,
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
court
is
confronted
with
the
question,
do
we
let
the
fellow
die--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--it
has
to
come
back
into
federal
court
in
any
event.
there
are
three
other
issues
in
this
case
that
are
already
in
federal
court
on
the
merits.
the
question
is...
there
are
really
only
three
options
to
the
court
below
and
we
are
asking
this
court
of
approve
one
of
them.
one,
to
let
harris
die
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
claims
clearly
ready
for
hearing
in
a
federal
court
and
a
claim
that
it
makes
sense
to
send
back
to
the
state
courts;
to
go
ahead
and
adjudicate
the
eighth
amendment
question
and
other
questions,
which
we
do
not
think
is
appropriate;
or
to
say
we
will
stay
his
execution,
we
will
wait
until
the
california
supreme
court
has
clarified
whether
state
law
gives
him
the
kind
of
proportionality
review
that
he
is
asking
for,
and
then
we
will
take
all
of
the
federal
issues
at
once
and
decide
them
as
rose
v.
lundy
contemplates.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
when?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
was
in...
february
11,
1981.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
harris
would
immediately
file
in
the
california
supreme
court
a
request
for
proportionality
review.
according
to
the
decision,
the
court
below
would
have
to
begin
such
a
process
in
four
months
and
it
could
have
as
much
time
as
it
then
wanted
to
reach
judgment
on
it.
there
is
one--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
are
talking
now
about
the
california
state
habeas
corpus
petition?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
he
raised
it
and
the
california
supreme
court
denied
the
petition
without
issuing
an
alternative
rule
to
show
cause,
which
means
they
did
not
get
to
the
merits.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
agree.
there
is
no
question
in
the
world
what
the
california
supreme
court
did
with
this
case
other
than
to
say
go
away.
it
is
very
unclear.
we
are
not
contending
that
it
is
clear
what
they
did.
what
i
am
contending
is
simply
that,
since
it
is
unclear
what
they
did,
and
since
california
law
has
now
evolved
to
the
point
where
it
may
very
well
give
the
kind
of
relief
which
we
are
seeking
under
the
eighth
amendment--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--ah--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--well,
again,
california
has
turned
their
sharp
corners.
it
is
difficult
looking
backwards
to
say
exactly
what
california
was
or
wasn't
at
a
given
time.
it
is
true
that
the
cases
at
that
time
didn't
go
as
far
as
dillon
does
now
and
as
far
as
the
cases
go
now,
all
the
more
reason,
we
think,
why
the
california
court
ought
to
get
another
crack
at
it.
the
only--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--we
would
urge,
as
we
did
in
the
state
habeas
petition,
that
the
california
court
give
that
kind
of
cross--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--the
ninth
circuit
opinion
finds
it
a
federal
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
right
on
the
merits.
we
also
believe
this
court
need
not
reach
the
question.
i
will
be
glad
to
get
why
we
believe
it
is
right
on
the
merits.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
ninth
circuit
decision
clearly
holds
that
it
is
required
under
the
eighth
amendment
whether
or
not
it
is
required
under
state
law.
we
are
prepared
to
uphold
that
view
on
the
merits.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let's
just
take
a
look
at
exactly
what
the
eighth
amendment
status
of
proportionality
review
is.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
cross-case
proportionality
review.
i
agree
with
mr.
wellington
on
one
point
which
is
that
the
place
one
has
to
look
to
find
the
answer
to
the
eighth
amendment
question
is
in
the
gregg,
proffitt,
jurek
cases
and
that
explanation
of
what
is
demanded
of
a
state...
that
sentencing
scheme.
recently
this
court
summed
up
in
a
very
few
words
what
is
demanded
by
saying
that
what
is
demanded
is
that
the
states
apply
the
death
penalty
with
reasonable
consistency
or
not
at
all.
now,
the
kind
of
review
which
is
required,
we
contend,
by
the
eighth
amendment
is
only
so
much
appellate
review
as
is
required
to
produce
reasonable
consistency.
what
a
court
needs
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case
in
front
of
it,
to
look
at
the
judgments
and
the
facts
of
comparable
cases
and
to
ask
whether,
in
the
class
of
case,
including
this
one,
the
death
penalty
has
been
so
infrequently
and
erratically
imposed
that
the
concerns
of
furman
are
violated.
and,
the
state
seems
to
concede
that
that
is
necessary
in
its
reply
brief.
the
court
says
that...
the
state
in
its
reply
brief
says
that
harris
has
not
contended...
this
is
on
page
23...
harris
has
not
shown
and
it
cannot
be
shown
that
either
an
overwhelming
majority
or
a
significant
minority
of
legislatures,
courts,
or
juries
in
states
with
capital
punishment
have
acted
to
repudiate
death
as
a
punishment
for
such
crimes
as
harris'.
there
is
no
way
in
which
harris
could
show
or
in
which
a
court
could
find
that
courts
and
juries
in
similar
cases
have
repudiated
the
death
penalty
unless
harris
is
permitted
to
lay
in
front
of
a
court,
and
we
say
the
california
supreme
court,
the
facts
of
his
case
and
the
judgments
rendered
in
comparable
cases
so
that
the
court
can
ask
the
question,
looking
at
the
pool
of
cases
like
harris',
has
the
death
penalty
been
so
infrequently
applied,
so
irregularly
applied,
that
the
considerations
which
brought
about
this
court's
furman
decision
apply
to
harris'
death
sentence.
that
is
all
that
is
involved.
it
isn't
some
special
mystic,
it
is
not
some
special
rule,
it
is
simply
a
straightforward
application
of
the
requirement
of
this
court
that
consistency
in
death
sentencing
is
a
pre-condition
of
constitutional
death
sentences.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
state
court
has
very
considerable
leeway
on
all
those
questions.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
how
do
the
state
courts
do
it?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
variety
of
ways.
some
state
courts
look
at
all
first
degree
murders
and
then
they
say
do
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
this
case
and
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
that
case
match
those
of
three,
four,
or
five.
after
they
have
found
that,
they
say
is
death
or
is
life
the
norm
in
those
other
cases.
some
states
say
it
is
limited
to
other
cases
of
first
degree
murder
in
which
the
same
aggravating
circumstance
is
found.
there
isn't
any
one
way
to
do
it.
there
are
very
sophisticated
ways
to
do
it
and
very
simply
ways
to
do
it.
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has,
in
a
sense,
done
it
itself.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
nothing
more
is
constitutionally
required
than
what
this
court
did
in
similar
judgments
in
furman.
for
example,
justice
white's
opinion
in
furman
said
essentially
i
have
seen
a
number
of
these
cases
come
through.
i
am
left
with
an
abiding
conviction,
after
looking
at
numbers
of
these
cases,
that
uniformity
and
even-handedness
are
lacking,
that
some
people
are
going
to
death
while
others
exactly
the
same
live.
all
we
said
is
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
a
state
appellate
court
of
general
jurisdiction
to
look
at
the
cases
passing
through
the
tubes
and
make
exactly
that
kind
of
judgment.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
the
california
supreme
court
looks
at
cases
and
says
that--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--that
is
right.
i
am
not
contending
for
one
minute
that
the
eighth
amendment
tells
the
state
supreme
court
how
to
write
its
opinion.
if
the
court
demonstrates
that
it
has
engaged
in
the
kind
of
look
at--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--can
they
do
it
by
memory?
again,
i
think
that
they
have
to
listen
to
counsel's
argument.
if
counsel
says
here
are
these
other
various
cases...
whether
a
judge
believes
that
he
or
she
remembers
the
facts
of
the
case
ago,
reads
it
in
a
brief,
i
have
never
thought
the
constitution
imposed
any
restraints
on
that.
as
long
as
the
court
does
a
conscientious
job
of
looking
to
see
whether
the
death
penalty
in
a
kind
of
case
like
the
one
at
bar
is
so
erratic
that
the
court
can
say
this
is
not
the
regular
and
evenhanded
imposition
of
a
death
penalty.
so
long
as
they
make
that
check,
that
is
all
the
federal
constitution
requires.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
yes.
the
state
habeas
petition...
for
example,
there
were
alleged
nine
cases
that
had
been
decided
on
appeal,
but
there
were
seven
other
cases
that
were
said
to
be
multiple
murder
cases
like
harris'
that
the
court
ought
to
look
at.
the
state
habeas
petition
essentially
took
this
position.
the
state
habeas
petition
said,
and
alleged
with
great
specificity
and
supporting
facts,
mr.
wellington's
position
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
it
alleged
with
great
specificity
that--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--sir?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
the
state
petition
was
somewhat
different
than
the
federal
petition,
although
the
mccabe
affidavit
to
both
petitions
is
the
same
and
that
gives
the
general
tenor
of
the
state
position.
the
state
proceedings
are
not
in
the
federal
court
record
unhappily.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
mccabe
affidavit
and
the
allegations
in
the
federal
petition,
yes,
at...
if
you
look
at
the
federal
habeas
petition
at
pages
5,
etcetera.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
particularly
paragraphs
1
and
5.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
of
the
federal
habeas
petition.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
simply
wanted
to
get--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--the
federal
habeas
petition
is
in
the
paragraphs
to
which
i
have
referred
are.
they
are
not
printed
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
they
are
in
the
record.
moreover,
the
mccabe
affidavit,
which
is
the
crucial
thing
and
presents
the
comparative
cases,
is
attached
to
the
federal
habeas
petition
as
well.
