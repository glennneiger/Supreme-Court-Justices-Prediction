justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose,
however,
the
court
had
to
assume
standing
existed
to
have
entered
the
order
it
did.
so
it's
much
harder
to
explain,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
long
as
you're
interrupted,
may
i
ask
you
another
question.
the
plaintiffs
below
alleged
that
the
internal
revenue
service
had
violated
with
the
tax
exemption
practice
several
specific
sections
or
at
least
one
section
of
the
revenue
code,
and
a
violation
of
title
vi
was
alleged,
and
a
violation
of
section
1981
and
i
guess
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
now,
in
your
view
is
it
unlawful
for
the
internal
revenue
service
under
any
of
those
sections
or
provisions
to
follow
the
policy
it
did
on
the
tax
exemption
if
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
know
that
the
school
is
discriminating
racially?
is
knowledge
an
element?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
landers,
in
your
petition
in
this
court
you
challenge
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
appropriation
riders
in
1980
and
'81
barred
the
claimed
relief.
you
don't
argue
that
in
your
brief.
is
that
because
there
aren't
currently
such
riders
and
you
think
that's
moot
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kapp,
i
suppose
in
the
complaint
below
two
different
types
of
injuries
were
alleged,
i
think:
first,
the
pure
stigma
injury;
second
was
the
reliance
on
diminished
ability
to
obtain
a
desegregated
public
school
education.
have
you
pretty
much
stopped
relying
on
the
pure
stigma
injury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
any
citizen
would
have
a
right
to
file
a
suit
to
complain
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
you
aren't
claiming
the
pure
stigma
injury.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
pin
you
down
on,
because
the
complaint
alleged
two
different
types
of
injury,
and
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
now
arguing
is
an
injury
suffered
by
someone
who
is
seeking
a
desegregated
education
and
you're
trying
to
limit
it
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
or
perhaps
all
white
citizens
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
all
those
people
have
a
cause
of
action,
then,
under
your
theory?
does
everyone
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
i'm
trying
to
pin
it
down
and
i
can't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kapp,
related
to
that,
did
the
district
court
ever
certify
a
class?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
going
back
to
the
standing
inquiry,
do
you
think
that
it's
necessary
for
the
plaintiffs
below
to
establish
a
causal
connection
between
the
irs
action
and
the
injury
alleged
with
regard
to
desegregation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
yes
or
no?
causal
connection
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
you
think
that
the
easiest
explanation
of
this
court's
decisions
on
standing
is
to
say
there
is
a
causal
connection
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
more
than
that,
because
it's
conceded
that
the
government
has
provisions
that
deny
tax
exemption.
it's
some
additional
procedures
that
the
plaintiffs
below
are
seeking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
necessary
that
the
government
know
about
the
discriminatory
practices
of
the
schools?
is
knowledge
required?
