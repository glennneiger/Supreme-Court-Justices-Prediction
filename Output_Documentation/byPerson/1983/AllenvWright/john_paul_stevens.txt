paul

mr.
solicitor
general...
i'm
sorry,
had
you
finished
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
justice
o'connor's
question
and
your
reference
to
title
vi
prompts
this
question
from
me.
you
say
that
if
the
internal
revenue
incorrectly
grants
a
tax
exemption
to
a
school
that's
contributing
to
white
flight,
allegedly,
and
therefore
it
kind
of
has
an
indirect
subsidy,
there's
no
standing
to
challenge
it.
supposing
it
were
a
direct
subsidy
and
you
had
some
different
agency
of
the
government
actually
subsidizing
the
new
school
would
there
be
standing
to
challenge
the
direct
subsidy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
sue
the
federal
official.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
well,
assume
it's
a
different
service,
it's
an
agency
like
hew
that
might
be
distributing
funds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
sue
them.
could
you
sue
the
secretary
of
hew
and
say
that
the
direct
subsidy
is
doing
the
same
thing
that
these
people
say
is
going
on
here?
could
there
be
standing
in
such
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
terms
of
impact
on
the
individual
litigant,
what's
the
difference
whether
it's
a
subsidy
in
the
form
of
cash
or
in
the
form
of
tax
exemption?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
restate
it.
their
theory,
as
i
understand,
is
that
the
federal
government
is
in
effect
supporting
the
creation
of
schools
that
enable
white
flight
to
occur
and
interfere
with
their
ability
to
go
to
racially
integrated
schools.
and
you
say,
well,
you
can't
sue
the
internal
revenue
for
granting
a
tax
exemption
to
support
that,
for
very
persuasive
reasons.
i'm
wondering
if
your
argument
would
also
apply
in
terms
of
standing
only...
i'm
not
talking
about
separation
of
powers
or
all
the
other
problems
that
are
around
the
corner
here.
in
terms
of
standing
only,
what
would
be
the
difference,
if
any,
between
a
direct
subsidy
of
federal
dollars
instead
of
federal
tax
exemption
for
such
a
school?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
landers,
can
i
ask
you,
if
these
people
had
applied
for
admission
to
the
school
you
represent
and
been
denied
admission,
do
you
think
they'd
have
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
would
they
have
standing
to
bring
a
suit
against
the
revenue
department?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
that's
really
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
the
fact
that
they
didn't
apply
to
your
school
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
landers,
as
i
understand
your
position
there
would
be
no
standing
even
if
there
were
no
remedy.
you've
given
us
examples
of
remedies,
but
your
position
on
article
iii
as
i
understand
it
is
that
they
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
these
things.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
irs
had
a
policy
of
not
caring
at
all
about
these
issues,
they
could
not
be
challenged?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
constitutional
issue
then
turn
on
the
fact
that
they
have
in
fact
been
diligent
in
pursuing
these
goals?
