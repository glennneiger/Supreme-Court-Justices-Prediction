mr.
robert
h.
kapp
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
not
involve
a
claim
to
standing
by
all
taxpayers
or
all
citizens.
it
does
not
even
involve
a
claim
to
standing
by
all
black
citizens.
rather,
it
involves
a
claim
to
standing
limited
to
a
class
of
black
school
children
enrolled
in
public
school
systems
which
are
desegregating,
either
voluntarily
or
pursuant
to
court
order.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
i
think
the
injury,
your
honor,
consists
of
a
multitude
of
facets.
basically,
the
injury
in
the
case
as
we
see
it
is
the
same
as
the
injury
in
brown,
as
that
injury
was
elaborated
upon
in
green
versus
new
kent
county
schools.
it's
the
government
participation
in
the
denial
of
the
right
of
school
children
to
attend
a
desegregated
public
school
system.
and
what
we
say
basically
is
that
the
grant
of
significant
financial
assistance
to
a
discriminatory
private
school
is
the
legal
equivalent
for
equal
protection
purposes
of
operating
that
segregated
system
itself.
so
that
i
would
say
in
answer
to
your
question
that
the
second
aspect
of
injury
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
basically
simply
an
elaboration
of
the
first.
the
provision
of
significant
aid
to
a
private
discriminatory
school
constitutes
a
government
approval,
constitutes
government
approval
of
a
discriminatory
private
school
system.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
certainly
not,
your
honor.
i
don'
t
think
that...
i
think
that
the
group
of
citizens
that
are
entitled
to
file
an
action
here
are
those
citizens
that
are
directly
affected
by
the
government's
action
in
providing
tax
exemption.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
stigma
is
only
part
of
the
injury
that
is
suffered,
your
honor.
the
injury
includes
the
fact
that
racially
discriminatory
schools
with
government
support
are
operating
in
the
district,
and
so
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
fact
that
the
government
supports
racially
discriminatory
schools
stigmatizes
all
black
citizens.
but
one
doesn't
have
to
reach--
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
--it
may
stigmatize
all
white
citizens
as
well.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
because
the
black
students
that
attend
public
schools
in
desegregating
public
school
districts
are
particularly
injured
by
the
fact
that
the
government
is
supporting
racially
segregated
private
schools
in
those
districts.
those
are
the
persons
who
are
the
victims
of
that
action,
on
whom
the
burden
falls
to
the
greatest
extent.
it
may
be
that
other
people
suffer
injury
as
well,
and
in
fact
there
is
some
generalized
injury
as
well.
but
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
see
that
there
is
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
the
injury
on
the
children
of,
let's
say,
respondent
inez
wright,
who
attend
the
briarcrest
school
system...
who
attend
the
public
school
systems
in
memphis
and
attend
a
99
percent
black
high
school
in
memphis,
where
the
government
is
at
the
same
time
providing
tax
exemptions
to
the
briarcrest
school
system,
which
is
racially
segregated
and
which
judge
mccray
has
said
is
impeding
public
school
desegregation.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
i
think
there
is
a
well-developed
constitutional
rule
here
that
derives
from
norwood,
which
says
that
at
least
when
the
government
is
providing
financial
assistance,
either
in
the
form
of
tuition
grants
or
tax
exemptions,
that
that
is
the
legal
equivalent
of
operating
the
school
simply
for
the
purposes
of
analysis.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
i
think
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
the
reason
that
justice
burger,
chief
justice
burger,
indicated
in
the
norwood
case
itself.
when
you
get
into
the
first
amendment
area,
there
are
competing
considerations
with
respect
to
the
free
exercise
clause
on
the
one
hand
and
the
establishment
clause
on
the
other.
and
as
chief
justice
burger
said
in
norwood,
there's
a
certain
play
in
the
joints,
if
you
will,
in
the
free
exercise-establishment
area
which
does
not
exist
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
that
is,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
the
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
your
honor,
they
may
or
may
not.
i'm
not
sure
precisely
what
the
answer
is
in
that
context.
but
i
feel
quite
confident
of
what
the
answer
is
in
the
context
of
education,
because
that
stigma,
as
the
brown
case
recognizes,
has
an
adverse
effect
on
the
educational
process
itself.
it
interferes
with
the
educational
process.
that's
really,
as
i
understand
it--
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
--in
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
elementary
and
secondary
school
education,
the
basic
education,
if
you
will,
in
the
united
states,
is
of
just
simply
greater
significance,
and
an
interference
with
that
educational
process
is
the
very
thing
that
brown
recognizes
is
an
injury.
now,
a
stigma
may
cause
an
injury
in
other
instances,
and
you
can
look
at
that
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
but
in
the
area
at
least
of
education,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
a
very
clearly
established
set
of
precedents.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
the
plaintiffs
are
attending...
the
plaintiffs
in
our
case
are
people
who
are
attending
school
in
desegregating
public
school
districts,
and
those
systems,
so
far
as
i
understand,
have
not
been
determined
to
be
unitary
in
any
way,
although
i
think
that
fact
really
wouldn't
matter
under
justice
burger's
opinion
in
norwood.
but
the
group,
the
class
which
we
seek
to
represent,
are
people
who
are
attending
public
school
in
desegregating
public
school
districts.
some
of
those
school
districts
are
under
court
order,
other
of
those
school
districts
are
desegregating
pursuant
to
hew
directive
or
hhs
directive
or
department
of
education
directive,
and
others
of
those
schools
are
voluntarily
desegregating.
and
we
have
a
group
of
respondents
in
various
different
classes.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
well,
if
you
mean
by
desegregated,
your
honor,
schools
that
are
under
court
order
to
desegregate
or
are
voluntarily
desegregating
or
under
hew
directive
to
desegregate,
that
is
correct.
at
least
that
was
certainly
correct
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
if
your
honor,
in
all
due
respect,
you
mean
it
in
the
sense
that
i
responded.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
they
have
not,
your
honor.
the
motion
to
dismiss
occurred
prior
to
the
attempted
class
certification
and
the
judge,
the
district
court
judge,
deferred
a
hearing
on
class
certification
pending
the
outcome
of
this
action.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
can
be
found
in
the
norwood
decision
itself.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
there
is
no
required
causal
connection
between
the
effect
of
the
tax
exemption
and
the
desegregation
of
public
schools.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
you
will,
the
grant
of
tax
exemption
and
the
approval
that
goes
with
it
interfere
with
the
desegregation
of
the
public
school
systems,
but
we
would
not
need
to
prove
that.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
well,
there's
a
causal
connection
in
the
sense
that
the
only
action
that
we're
complaining
about
here
is
the
action
of
the
government
in
providing
tax
exemption.
that
in
and
of
itself
causes
the
injury,
so
the
causal
connection
is
established.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
we
allege
in
the
complaint
that
the
government...
and
we
are
entitled
to
have
that
taken
as
true
for
purposes
of
the
motion
to
dismiss...
that
the
government
is
in
fact
granting
tax
exemptions
to
racially
discriminatory
schools.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
schools
that
have
been
declared,
adjudicated
by
the
courts,
by
a
district
court
in
louisiana,
have
been
adjudicated
discriminatory
and
yet
continue
to
have
tax
exemption.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
your
honor,
under
this
court's
decision
in
norwood
the
fact
that
the
statute
under
which
the
state
of
mississippi
was
providing
textbooks
was
facially
neutral
and
that
there
was
no
intent
to
discriminate
established
made
no
difference.
the
fact
is,
whether
the
government...
whatever
it
is,
the
government's
procedures
are
ineffective
for
distinguishing
between
discriminatory
schools
and
nondiscriminatory
schools.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
in
1979
conceded
that
in
a
public
hearing.
so
the
fact
is,
the
government
must
know
it.
the
commissioner
himself
knew
it.
but
i
don't
think
as
a
matter
of
law
based
upon
norwood
that
there
is
any
requirement
of
intent,
if
you
will.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
well,
the
difference,
your
honor,
was
that
in
the
schlesinger
case
you
were
talking
about
simply
a
violation
of
the
constitution
resulting
from
government
conduct
that
all
citizens
suffered
in
equal
degree.
nobody
was
especially
hurt
by,
particularly
hurt
by
that
any
more
than
anybody
else,
and
the
court
basically
held
in
that
case,
in
fact
as
it
did
in
valley
forge,
that
there
is
no
standing
in
the
case
of
a
generalized
injury.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
particular
injury
that
falls
on
particular
black
school
children
who
attend
public
schools
in
desegregating
public
school
districts.
it's
quite
possible
for
the
court
to
do
this,
demand
this,
without
turning
the
government
upside-down.
the
fact
is
the
district
court
in
the
court
of
columbia
in
the
green
case
has
provided
such
an
order
with
respect
to
mississippi
schools
and
the
government
is
going
about
following
that
order,
and
there's
no
reason,
if
there
are...
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
there
are
black
students
who
stand
in
the
same
position
that
the
black
students
stand
in
mississippi,
whose
right
to
a
desegregated
education
is
being
interfered
with,
that
they
would
not
have
a
right
to
standing
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
service
could
carry
that
out
without
any
great
difficulty.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
the
difference
between
the
two
schools,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
school
that
is
discriminatory
the
government's
providing
of
a
tax
exemption
signals
official
approval
of
that
school,
which
in
turn
injures
the
public
school
students
and--
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
--it
interferes--
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
--well,
it
strengthens
the
school
and
increases
the
attractiveness
of
the
school.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
well,
certainly,
your
honor,
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
attend
a
private
school.
that's
a
well
recognized
right.
it's
the
fact,
your
honor,
if
you
will,
that
the
government
is
approving
here
a
system
of
segregated
schools.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
well,
the
desegregation
process,
i
suppose,
has
to
do
more
with
a
lack
of
government
sanction
for
a
dual
school
system
than
it
does
necessarily
with
any
particular
mix
of
students
that
you
would
have.
and
so
the
injury
is
the
fact
of
government
approval
of
a
continuation
of
a
type
of
the
old
dual
school
system,
if
you
will,
the
fact
that
the
government
is
approving
racially
identifiable
schools,
and
that
does
interfere
with
the
educational
process,
we
contend,
and
for
the
same
reason
interferes
with
the
desegregation
process.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
the
way...
although
these
are
questions
of
relief,
basically,
and
they
don't
go
to
the
question
of
standing.
but
i
think
that
what
would
happen
here
would
be
basically,
if
we
were
to
succeed,
is
basically
what
happened
in
norwood.
the
lower
court
would
provide
that
where
a
school
is
formed
or
expanded
in
the
wake
of
pubic
school
desegregation
and
is
an
all-white
school
that
there
would
be
a
presumption
of
discrimination
which
would
attach.
but
the
school
would
have
the
full
opportunity
to
establish
for
a
lot
of
reasons
that
it
wasn't
discriminating.
and
it
would
in
fact,
under
the
type
of
relief
we
envision,
would
have
a
full
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
that
before
a
system
of
courts.
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
make
one
comment
about
the
valley
forge
case,
if
i
could.
the
valley
forge
case,
in
all
due
respect,
does
not
control
this
proceeding.
the
valley
forge
case
was
a
case
of
generalized
injury.
the
government
transferred
property
to
a
school,
a
church-related
school
in
pennsylvania.
the
complainants
were
a
plaintiff
in
maryland
and
a
plaintiff
in
virginia
who
read
about
the
transfer
of
property
in
the
newspapers.
there
was
no
nexus
between
the
challenged
action
and
the
injury
that
was
suffered
by
the
particular
persons.
this
court
in
fact
itself
in
valley
forge
distinguished
the
case,
the
abingdon
school
board
case,
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases...
in
that
case,
who
were
school
children
in
a
particular
school,
would
have
been
directly
affected
by
the
government's
action.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
particular
school
children
in
particular
districts,
school
districts,
who
we
contend
are
being
injured
by
this
action.
it
is
not
a
generalized
grievance
involving
all
citizens
or
all
taxpayers,
and
therefore
is
fully
distinguishable
from
the
valley
forge
case.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
only
if
the
grant
of
tax
exemption
was
interfering
with
particular
public
school
students.
those
students
would
have
standing
to
challenge
the
government's
action.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
it
would
only
if
the
government's
grant
of
tax
exemption,
like
a
grant
of
a
subsidy--
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
--it
would
only
if
it
were...
only
to
those
students
who
were
affected
by
the
grant
of
tax
exemption.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
it
would
only,
i
think,
as
in
norwood,
where
the
grant
of
aid
injures
particular
students.
obviously
there
would
have
to
be
lines
drawn.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
fact...
for
example,
we
don't
contend
that
the
fact
that
the
government
is
granting
tax
exemptions
to
a
racially
discriminatory
school,
let's
say
in
boston,
gives
a
black
student,
a
black
citizen
in
los
angeles,
the
right
to
sue.
we're
looking
at
specific
situations
where
the
existence
of
the
discriminatory
school
is
basically
interfering
with
the
educational
process
and
is
interfering
with
the
desegregation
process
and
it
affects,
directly
affects,
particular
persons.
it's
possible,
for
example,
in
the
valley
forge
context,
as
i've
just
indicated,
for
the
government
aid
in
that
case
to
directly
affect
particular
people.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
you
would
not
have
to
decide
that
question,
your
honor,
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
i
think
there
is
a
particular
injury
which
accrues
when
the
schools
are
desegregated
which
may
not
accrue
where
you
already
have
a
unitary
system
or
where
you
have
no
previous
segregated
system.
mr.
robert
h.
kapp
i
think
you
have
to
decide
each
of
these
cases
on
an
individual
basis.
i
do
think
that
in
many
cases
the
stigma
will
interfere,
itself
interferes
with
the
educational
process
because
it
gives
the
black
school
children
a
sense
of
lesser
worth
and
so
forth.
the
existence
of
that
stigma
occurring
in
michigan
may
not
affect
somebody
who
is
in
california
to
a
degree
sufficient
to
seek
standing.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honors,
i
am
prepared
to
submit
my
case.
