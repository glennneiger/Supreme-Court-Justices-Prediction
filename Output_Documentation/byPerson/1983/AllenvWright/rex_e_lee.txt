mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
lawsuit
was
brought
as
a
class
action
by
parents
of
black
students
attending
desegregating
public
publics
in
seven
states
and
seeking
to
represent
a
nationwide
class
of
several
million
parents
similarly
situated.
the
relief
that
they
seek
is
not
desegregation
of
a
public
school
nor
admission
of
any
child
to
any
school,
public
or
private.
rather,
they
seek
an
order
that
the
internal
revenue
service
change
its
standards
for
determining
the
tax
exempt
status
of
private
schools
which
their
children
neither
attend
nor
seek
to
attend
located
in
or
serving
desegregating
public
school
districts.
the
plaintiffs
lack
standing
to
bring
this
action.
they
lack
standing
for
two
separate
reasons,
each
of
which
is
independently
dispositive
and
each
of
which
is
squarely
based
on
a
holding
by
this
court.
i
will
discuss
each
of
those
two
holdings
separately,
and
the
first
is
valley
forge
christian
college
versus
americans
united
for
separation
of
church
and
state.
valley
forge
makes
clear
that
without
exception,
even
in
establishment
clause
cases,
there
is
no
standing
to
sue
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
the
federal
government
faithfully
observe
a
particular
plaintiff's
view
of
the
requirements
of
a
particular
provision
of
the
constitution.
the
constitutionally
irreduceable
minimum
requirement
of
injury
in
fact
must
be
an
injury
that
is
more
narrow
in
scope
than
breach
of
the
interest
shared
by
all
citizens
in
assuring
that
government
steer
clear
of
any
particular
kind
of
governmental
conduct,
such
as
giving
financial
aid
to
a
church
or
to
a
discriminating
school
or
violates
the
ineligibility
clause
or
the
accounts
clause
or
the
incompatibility
clause.
if
any
exception
to
that
general
principle,
which
reaches
all
the
way
back
for
60
years
to
frothingham
versus
mellon,
were
to
be
acknowledged,
the
strongest
possible
case
for
an
exception
existed
in
valley
forge
itself,
because,
as
stressed
by
the
dissents
in
that
case,
one
of
the
central
functions
of
the
establishment
clause
is
to
prevent
precisely
what
the
plaintiffs
were
alleging
in
valley
forge,
namely
direct
governmental
aid
to
religion.
the
court
very
correctly
ruled
that
there
is
no
exception,
even
for
establishment
clause
cases,
and
thereby
established
that
article
iii
has
independent
constitutional
significance
of
its
own
and
the
standing
issue
is
to
be
considered
prior
to
and
independent
of
any
other
constitutional
issue
whose
substance
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
vindicate.
the
other
case
whose
holding
also
squarely
controls,
though
for
quite
different
reasons,
is
simon
versus
eastern
kentucky
welfare
rights
organization,
whose
facts
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
simon
held
that
indigent
persons
and
organizations
lack
standing
to
challenge
the
tax
exempt
status
of
hospitals
which
refused
fully
to
service
the
indigent,
and
the
reason
that
they
lacked
standing
was
because
one
could
only
speculate
whether
the
relief
that
they
sought,
namely
the
revocation
of
the
exemptions,
would
in
fact
cure
the
injury
on
which
their
standing
was
based,
namely
the
unavailability
of
hospital
services.
the
identical
defect
exists
in
this
case,
as
even
the
court
of
appeals
recognized.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
distinguished
simon
from
this
case
on
the
ground
that
school
desegregation
cases
in
that
court's
view
call
for
a
different,
more
relaxed
set
of
standing
requirements.
the
court
concluded
that
three
of
this
court's
desegregation
decisions,
norwood,
gilmore
and
green,
were
in
tension
with
simon
and
that
the
court
was
therefore
forced
to
select
from
two
divergent
lines
of
supreme
court
decisions.
in
fact,
i
submit
there
is
no
divergence
at
all
and
simon
squarely
governs
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
notion
that
for
purposes
of
determining
standing
there
is
any
difference
between
school
desegregation
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
hospital
discrimination
cases
on
the
other,
that
the
weight
of
the
article
iii
burden
somehow
shifts,
diminishes
or
increases
according
to
the
nature
or
importance
of
the
substantive
claim
was
squarely
rejected
by
this
court
and
expressly
rejected
by
this
court
in
valley
forge,
which
came
down
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case.
second,
even
considered
in
isolation,
the
decisions
in
norwood,
gilmore
and
green
do
not
establish
any
doctrinal
enclave
for
standing
a
desegregation
cases.
indeed,
in
our
view
they
establish
very
few
standing
principles
at
all
because,
as
judge
tamm
pointed
out
in
dissent,
they
were
not
standing
cases.
the
defendants
in
norwood
and
gilmore
were
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
city
of
montgomery,
the
precise
governmental
bodies
that
had
discriminated
against
these
claimants
in
prior
precise
desegregation
suits
because
of
the
race
of
those
plaintiffs,
norwood,
gilmore,
and
their
colleagues.
having
in
both
cases
been
parties
to
specific
desegregation
decrees,
the
plaintiffs
in
norwood
and
gilmore
brought
suit
directly
against
those
who
had
discriminated
against
them
and,
as
the
court
observed
in
gilmore,
the
relief
that
they
sought
was
directly
related
to
the
concrete
injury
they
suffered.
here,
by
contrast,
the
suit
is
against
the
revenue
collector
and
not
against
the
discriminator.
with
regard
to
the
summary
affirmance
in
green,
the
standing
issue
was
not
squarely
presented.
this
court's
ruling
was
only
a
summary
affirmance,
and
this
court
later
observed
that
because
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
were
in
agreement,
the
court's
affirmance
in
green
lacks
the
precedential
weight
of
a
case
involving
a
truly
adversary
controversy.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
that
any
court
necessarily
holds
that
there
is
standing
in
any
decision
where
it
renders
a
substantive
decision
on
the
merits.
however,
even
if
you
get
over
the
valley
forge
hurdle,
which
i
submit
you
can't
in
this
instance,
which
came
down
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
so
that
you
have
to
weigh
the
persuasive
merits
of
a
green
decision
on
the
one
hand
and
a
simon
on
the
other,
which
came
down
after
green,
certainly
for
reasons
set
forth
in
this
court's
first
bob
jones
decision
the
green
decision
is
of
less
persuasive
merit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
under
the
present
procedure
that
is
followed
by
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
a
perfectly
acceptable
procedure,
knowledge
is
gained
by
the
devices
that
are
available
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
and
certainly
they
cannot
revoke
the
tax
exemptions
of
any
entity
whom
they
do
not
know
to
be
discriminating.
but
they
do
the
best
job
that
they
can
of
finding
out
who
those
discriminators
are
and
then
revoking
their
tax
exemptions.
if
there
are
1981
violations,
then
there
should
be
1981
suits
brought
against
the
discriminators.
if
there
are
title
vi
violations,
then
title
vi
suits
should
be
brought
against
the
discriminators.
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
issue
for
the
competitors
or
the
adversaries
in
1981
suit
on
a
title
vi
suit
to
go
beyond
bringing
the
direct
suit
to
cure
the
particular
injury
in
fact
that
they
had
and
seek
to
employ
the
machinery
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
impose
a
heavier
burden
on
their
adversary
or
their
competitor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
there
would
be
standing
to
challenge
the
direct
subsidy--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
not
to
sue
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
see.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
believe
there
would
be
standing
in
such
a
case--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--to
bring
suit
directly
against
hew,
hhs,
to
prevent
the
payment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
whether
it's
a
difference
between...
there
is
a
difference
between
tax
cases
and
non-tax
cases,
which
i
will
get
to,
in
that,
reaching
all
the
way
back
to
louisiana
versus
mcadoc,
this
court
has
recognized
that
tax
cases
may
fit
in
a
different
category.
but
where
the...
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
but
if
it
is
simply
that
there
is
a
direct...
excuse
me.
this
is
a
situation,
then,
where
it's
a
governmental
entity
that
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
right,
i
think
i
understand
your
question
now.
it
is
a
question,
i
think,
that
pushes
our
principle
to
its
limits,
and
i
have
two
answers
to
it.
i
think
the
first
answer
is
that
under
valley
forge
as
i
understand
it
in
that
particular
instance
there
is
no
standing
to
sue.
my
second
answer
is
that
that
is
not
this
case,
and
the
reason
that
it
is
not
this
case
is
this.
even
if
you
ignore
valley
forge
and
you
say
that
these
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
a
government
that
does
not
grant
tax
exemptions
to
racially
discriminatory
schools
or,
in
our
instance,
to
a
department
of
hhs
that
does
not
grant
any
kind
of
subsidy
to
racially
discriminatory
schools,
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
it
has
not
been
the
issue,
it
has
never
been
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
it
is
not
an
issue
at
all
since
may
the
25th
of
last
year.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
best
way
to
identify
racially
discriminatory
schools
and
then
revoke
their
tax
exemptions.
there
are
three
basic
approaches
to
that
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
indeed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
very
correct.
i
thought
so
two
years
and
three
months
ago
and
i
think
so
today.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
does...
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
justice
blackmun,
it
did
present
the
strongest
possible
case
for
an
exception
to
the
general
principle
that
had
beer
established
in
frothingham
versus
bellen,
schlesinger,
richardson,
and
so
forth,
in
that
the
establishment
clause
apart
from
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution
does,
as
the
dissents
in
that
case
noted,
specifically...
or
one
of
its
central
functions
is
to
guarantee
against
direct
government
aid
to
religion,
so
that
in
the
establishment
clause
context,
arguably
the
constitution
itself
creates
standing,
just
like
a
statute
can
create
standing.
now,
that
proposition
lost
five
to
four
and
that
was
a
correct
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
the
court
is
greatly
strengthening
the
article
iii
principle
with
its
decision
in
valley
forge.
but
in
any
event,
to
whatever
extent
there
might
be
a
separate
consideration
for
establishment
clause
cases,
that
does
not
obtain
in
a
case
such
as
this.
now,
the
only
issue
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
is
not
whether
there
should
be
tax
exemptions
for
racially
discriminatory
schools;
the
only
issue
is,
out
of
three
possible
alternatives...
and
so
far
as
i
know,
to
date
there
are
only
three
possible
alternatives...
which
is
the
best
of
these
three
alternatives
for
identifying
which
are
the
racially
discriminatory
schools
and
then
revoking
their
tax
exemptions.
those
three
alternatives
are:
the
existing
procedure
that
is
now
followed,
revenue
procedure
75-50;
the
1978
and
1979
regulations;
and
what
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
in
this
case.
it
is
not
at
all
apparent
which
of
those
is
the
best
approach,
as
is
shown
by
the
difficulty
that
congress
has
had
and
the
internal
revenue
service
has
had
in
selecting
among
those
three
approaches.
what
this
case
really
boils
down
to
is
an
attempt
by
these
plaintiffs
to
take
the
resolution,
the
choice
among
those
three
policy
choices,
away
from
the
political
branches
and
secure
their
first
choice
of
alternative
by
judicial
decree,
and
that
is
clearly
outside
the
bounds
of
standing
to
sue
in
a
federal
court.
let
me
make
just
one
final
point,
and
it
is
that
this
is
an
income
tax
case,
the
standing
rules
should
apply
across
the
board
to
all
substantive
matters
that
come
before
the
federal
courts,
but
that
there
is
an
extra
layer
of
consideration
in
income
tax
cases.
taxpayers
do
have
standing
to
seek
review
of
their
own
tax
liability
and,
as
occurred
in
taxation
with
representation
last
year,
they
may
challenge
the
tax
treatment
of
others
where
it
is
relevant
to
their
our
claims
for
consistent
treatment.
to
go
beyond
that,
we
submit,
would
be
both
unprecedented
and
also
unwise.
it
would
put
in
the
hands
of
adversaries
and
competitors
of
the
taxpayer
a
powerful
weapon
which
would
not
only
distort
the
adversarial
and
competitive
processes,
but
also,
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
louisiana
versus
mcadoc,
"operate
to
disturb
the
whole
revenue
system
of
the
government.
"
this
does
not
mean
that
the
revenue
laws
will
go
unenforced.
it
just
means
that
the
enforcement
will
be
uniform,
accomplished
by
government,
as
prescribed
and
overseen
by
congress,
rather
than
exists
as
a
weapon
to
be
picked
up
at
will
by
those
who
wish
to
inflict
additional
burdens
on
fellow
citizens
with
whom
they
disagree.
if
private
citizens
have
information
that
someone
is
not
paying
his
fair
share
of
taxes,
they
should
provide
that
information
to
the
tax
collector
rather
than
running
into
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
unless
the
court
has
questions,
your
honor.
