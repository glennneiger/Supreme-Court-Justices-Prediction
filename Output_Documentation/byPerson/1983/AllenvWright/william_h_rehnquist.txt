mr.
kapp,
if
you
are
correct
that
the
government
grant
of
a
tax
exemption
to
a
school
such
as
briarcrest
is
equivalent
to
the
government
in
effect
operating
the
school,
wouldn't
that
line
of
reasoning
carry
you
over
to
say
that
if
the
government
grants
a
tax
exemption
to
a
church
it's
tantamount
to
the
government
operating
the
church
and
therefore
would
be
barred
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
right.
but
if
that's
correct
for
the
purposes
of
analysis,
why
isn't
it
equally
correct
to
say
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
for
the
government
to
grant
a
tax
exemption
to
a
church?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
you
have
a
school
in
north
dakota,
a
public
school.
there's
never
been
the
slightest
claim
of
segregation
at
all.
and
you
have
side
by
side
in
the
same
town
in
north
dakota
a
segregated
academy.
now,
would
a
black
student
going
to
the
public
school
in
north
dakota
have
standing
to
challenge
the
grant
by
the
government
of
tax
exemption
to
the
segregated
academy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
it
doesn't
depend...
if
you
don't
have
to
decide
that,
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
public
schools
are
being
desegregated
or
are
under
a
court
order
to
desegregate.
