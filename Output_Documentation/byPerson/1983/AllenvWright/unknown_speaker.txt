[laughter]

of
course,
one
can
argue,
though,
that
the
court
is
eroding
the
religion
clauses
somewhat
with
these
five
to
four
decisions,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
another
hypothetical.
suppose
we
went
back,
the
government,
the
united
states
went
back
to
something
they
abandoned
30-odd
years
ago
and
had
segregated
military
forces.
would
your
clients,
present
clients,
have
a
right
to
bring
the
same
kind
of
a
lawsuit
you
have
brought
here
to
challenge
that
segregation
in
the
military
forces?
because
that
would
clearly
be
a
taint
on
both
races.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
recruiting
activities
of
the
united
states
with
our
voluntary
system
emphasize
the
education
available
in
the
armed
forces.
that's
the
principal
inducement
used
for
the
volunteer
army.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kapp,
in
that
connection
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
fact.
are
all
of
the
children
of
your
respondents
attending
desegregated
schools?
unknown
speaker
how
many
are
not?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
regarded
your
answer
as
entirely
consistent.
i
take
it,
then,
that
all
of
the
children
of
respondents
attend
desegregated
schools
today?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
desegregated
schools.
i
don't
care
how.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
in
the
affirmative.
unknown
speaker
in
either
laird
against
tatum
or
schlesinger
against
the
reservists,
this
court
said
something
to
the
effect
that
to
allow
all
of
these
people
to
challenge
governmental
decisions
would
turn
the
operations
of
the
government
into
something
like
a
town
meeting.
wouldn't
that
same
concept
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kapp,
suppose
there
are
two
schools
in
a
community,
two
private
schools.
one
of
them
is
one
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
other
one
is
a
private
school
that
everybody
agrees
does
not
discriminate.
but
the
government
provides
tax
exemption
for
both
of
them.
in
terms
of
what
you
claim
is
an
injury
to
the
desegregation
of
the
schools,
of
these
schools
that
are
in
the
process
of
desegregating,
in
terms
of
that
injury
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
how
does
it
interfere
with
the
desegregation
of
the
school?
unknown
speaker
other
than
providing
another
school
for
white
children
to
go
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
happens,
certainly.
but
both
public
schools
are
going
to
provide
an
alternative
place
for
children
to
go.
they
don't
need
to
go
to
public
school.
and
it
may
be
that
it
would
be...
just
by
having
a
place
for
students
to
go,
it
may
make
it
more
difficult
to
desegregate
the
school
because
a
lot
of
students
won't
be
going
to
public
school.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
like
you're
constantly
coming
back
to
a
variety
of
the
stigma
argument.
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
bad
argument,
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
there's
anything
concretely
different
between
the
two
schools
i've
described
in
terms
of
impact
on
the
desegregation
process.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
any
of
the
schools
that
you
claim
were
discriminatory
schools,
if
a
particular
school
suddenly
changed
its
policy
in
a
manner
that
you
would
agree
was
no
longer
discriminatory,
you
would
no
longer
be
attacking
the
tax
exemption
of
that
school?
unknown
speaker
so
i
suppose
a
fortiori
if
you
have
standing
in
this
case
you
could
in
any
case
sue
the
commissioner
and
ask
that
he
lift
the
tax
exemption
of
the
specific
school
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
discriminatory,
even
though
the
commissioner
may
have
reviewed
it
internally
and
found
that
it
wasn't
for
his
own
satisfaction?
you
could
always
in
a
case,
specific
case,
litigate
the
tax
exemption,
the
existing
tax
exemption
of
a
particular
school?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
almost
anywhere
you
could
find
students
attending
a
public
school
that
was
desegregated,
even
if
it
was
not
desegregating,
but
was
desegregated,
was
a
unitary
system.
i
suppose
your
theory
would
give
standing
to
a
black
student
to
challenge
the
tax
exemption
granted
to
a
school
down
the
street
that
allegedly
is
discriminating.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
you
allege
that
in
your
complaint,
and
that
would
give
you
standing,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
are
students
who
are
registered
in
the
schools
i
just
described,
in
the
public
schools
i've
just
described,
and
down
the
street
is
a
school
that
has
tax
exemption
that
these
students
claim
is
discriminating
against
negroes.
and
i
suppose
your
theory
would
give
standing
to
such
plaintiffs
just
anywhere
to
challenge
the
commissioner's
grant
of
a
tax
exemption.
unknown
speaker
so
the
stigma...
that
seems
to
dispense
with
the
stigma
basis
for
standing.
