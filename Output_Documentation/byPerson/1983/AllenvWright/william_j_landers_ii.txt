mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
intervenor,
reverend
wayne
allen,
first
learned
of
this
case
when
he
read
about
it
in
the
newspaper.
what
he
learned
was
that
respondents,
parents
with
school
attending
desegregated
public
schools,
had
filed
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
to
have
the
court
require
the
irs
to
revoke
the
tax
exempt
status
of
3500
non-party
private
schools,
including
the
school
that
reverend
allen
had
founded
in
memphis,
tennessee.
although
each
of
these
schools
professed
under
penalty
of
perjury
to
have
an
open
admissions
policy
and
respondents
had
not
been
denied
admission
to
any
of
these
schools,
respondents
sought
a
blanket
condemnation
of
all
these
schools
and
revocation
of
the
schools'
tax
exemption
based
upon
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
discrimination,
primarily
as
a
result
of
the
school's
failure
to
attract
its
quota
of
minority
students.
prior
to
reverend
allen's
intervention,
no
party
had
any
interest
in
the
rights
of
these
3500
schools,
whose
rights
would
be
drastically
affected
by
respondents'
desired
remedy.
respondents'
had
never
sought
admission
to
any
of
these
schools,
had
no
desire
to
attend
any
of
these
schools,
had
never
been
deterred
from
applying
to
any
of
these
schools,
and
of
course
had
never
been
discriminated
against
by
any
of
these
schools.
the
irs
likewise
had
no
stake
in
protecting
the
interests
of
the
schools.
the
lack
of
adverseness
between
the
irs
and
respondents
was
demonstrated
even
after
reverend
allen
intervened.
while
the
motions
to
dismiss
were
pending
in
the
district
court,
the
irs
and
respondents
spent
hundreds
of
hours
in
settlement
negotiations
trying
to
agree
on
what
procedure
should
be
applied
to
the
private
schools.
reverend
allen,
the
only
party
representing
the
interests
of
any
of
these
schools,
wasn't
even
informed
of
those
negotiations.
he
learned
of
them
then
the
irs
announced
to
the
press
and
the
court
that
the
irs
proposed
to
adopt
a
new
revised
procedure
which
embodied
most
of
respondents'
presumption
of
guilt
criteria,
despite
this
court's
admonition
in
norwood
that
no
one
can
be
required,
consistent
with
due
process,
to
prove
absence
of
violation
of
law.
it's
not
uncommon
for
the
irs
to
defend
actions
in
that
manner.
that
is,
responding
initially
to
suits
involving
the
rights
of
third
parties
by
saying,
you
can't
sue
me,
but
then
turning
around
and
asking,
well,
what
do
you
want?
that
is
precisely
what
the
irs
did
in
the
green
case
relied
upon
by
respondents.
the
ironic
result
is
that
the
green
case
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
revenue
procedure
75-50,
which
respondents
now
seek
to
challenge
as
inadequate.
in
fact,
in
the
1974
bob
jones
decision
this
court
commented
on
the
lack
of
an
adversary
contest
in
green.
the
point
is,
if
reverend
allen
had
not
read
about
this
case
in
the
newspaper
his
rights
and
those
of
3500
non-party
schools
could
have
been
drastically
affected
in
a
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
which
persons
likely
to
be
most
directly
affected
by
the
order
were
not
before
the
court.
there
is
no
guarantee
that
in
future
actions
of
this
sort
that
an
interested
party
will
learn
of
the
case
and
intervene,
which
emphasizes
the
importance
of
deciding
issues
and
rights
of
such
magnitude
only
in
truly
adversarial
contests.
this
court's
decisions,
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
in
eastern
kentucky
and
valley
forge
make
clear
that
injury
sufficient
to
give
standing
must
be
distinct,
concrete,
personal
injury
to
the
plaintiffs.
a
generalized
citizen's
grievance
or
a
shared
right
to
have
the
constitution...
to
have
the
government
act
in
accordance
with
the
claimant's
views
of
the
constitution
is
not
sufficient.
respondents'
asserted
injury
falls
squarely
within
the
meaning
of
those
cases,
the
holding
in
those
cases.
their
injury,
as
characterized
by
the
court
of
appeals,
is
the
denigration
they
suffered
as
black
parents
and
school
children
when
the
government
graces
with
tax
exempt
status
educational
institutions
in
their
communities
that
treat
members
of
their
race
as
persons
of
lesser
worth.
the
statement
of
injury
presumably
is
derived
from
the
steer-clear
language
in
norwood,
a
school
case.
but
there's
no
principled
basis
for
a
separate
standing
rule
as
to
schools.
so
to
recognize
standing
on
the
basis
asserted
by
respondents
would
mean
that
these
same
respondents
have
standing
to
challenge
all
charitable
tax
exemptions.
for
example,
they
would
have
standing
to
sue
seeking
to
require
the
irs
to
revoke
the
501(c)(3)
status
of
all
troops
of
girl
scouts
and
boy
scouts
which
do
not
have
their
quota
of
minorities.
furthermore,
in
moose
lodge
this
court
rejected--
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
--they
would
have
standing
under
runyon
versus
mccrary
to
bring
a
direct
action
against
that
school.
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
no,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
it
does
because
it
shows
that
they
have
even
less
interest
in
the
tax
exempt
status
of
this
school
than
did
the
plaintiffs
in
eastern
kentucky,
where
they
had
applied
to
the
hospitals
and
been
denied.
i
might
say,
if
they
did
apply
to
our
school
they'd
get
in.
but
they
have
even
less
of
a
concrete
injury
than
did
the
plaintiffs
in
eastern
kentucky.
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
the
riders
expired
in
1982,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
considered
those
and
addressed
this
question
shows
that
this
matter
is
appropriately
one
to
be
decided
by
the
executive
branch
with
oversight
by
congress,
as
solicitor
lee
said.
as
i
was
saying,
this
court
specifically
addressed
and
rejected
the
precise
standing
argument
advanced
by
respondents
in
moose
lodge.
there
the
court
restricted
mr.
irvis'
standing
to
a
challenge
of
the
type
of
discriminatory
conduct
to
which
he
had
been
subjected,
and
rejected
justice
douglas'
argument
in
his
dissent
which
would
have
given
standing
to
any
black
citizen
in
pennsylvania
to
bring
suit
against
the
state
whenever
any
other
citizen
had
been
discriminated
against.
so
to
allow
respondents
standing
necessarily
would
require
this
court
to
overrule
moose
lodge.
but
there's
no
necessity
to
reach
such
a
result.
as
i
stated,
if
respondents
applied
to
a
private
school
and
they'd
been
denied
admission,
they
have
a
direct
remedy
against
that
school
and
that
would
be
an
adversarial
contest
that
would
be
under
this
court's
opinion
in
runyon
versus
mccrary.
second,
if
respondents
wish
to
complain
that
any
particular
private
school
is
discriminating
but
is
still
retaining
its
tax
exempt
status,
they
can
avail
themselves
of
the
current
revenue
procedure
75-50.
section
6
under
that
procedure
invites
information
about
such
schools.
respondents
not
only
have
failed
to
do
so,
but
they
failed
to
allege
that
if
they
advised
the
irs
it
would
fail
to
act
on
that
information.
in
fact,
although
i
can't
speak
for
all
the
other
schools
which
were
named
as
examples
in
the
complaint,
i
know
that
they
named
reverend
allen's
school
as
an
example
of
a
segregated
school
which
was
tax
exempt.
immediately
following
reverend
allen's
intervention
in
this
suit,
the
irs
audited
his
school
and
found
it
to
be
nondiscriminatory.
the
respondents
named
the
prince
edward
school
in
the
complaint
as
an
example
of
a
discriminatory
school
with
tax
exempt
status.
the
irs
audited
prince
edward
and
revoked
its
tax
exempt
status,
which
this
court
upheld,
as
the
irs
has
done
to
some
106
other
schools
which
were
found
to
be
discriminatory.
there
is
a
remedy
in
a
properly
concrete
injury
and--
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
--they
didn't
have
to
do
any
of
these
things.
those
are
things
they
had
the
right
to
do,
but
did
not
avail
themselves
of.
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
but
that's
not
the
issue,
that's
not
the
case
before
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
william
j.
landers,
ii
no,
sir.
i
think
the
constitutional
issue
turns
on
the
fact
that
these
respondents
don't
have
a
concrete
injury
to
themselves
because
of
any
action
or
inaction
by
the
irs.
if
they
have
an
injury,
it's
as
a
result
of
some
conduct
by
the
schools,
which
they
chose
not
to
sue
and
in
a
proper
case
would
be
entitled
to
sue
if
they
had
been
discriminated
against
by
such
a
school.
thank
you.
