ms.
harriet
s.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
procedure
that
the
government
uses
in
exercising
its
power
of
eminent
domain
is
the
straight
condemnation
or
complaint
procedure.
under
that
procedure,
the
government
files
a
complaint
stating
that
it
wants
to
take
specific
property,
and
asking
the
court
to
establish
its
price.
that
is
just
compensation.
a
hearing
is
held,
and
the
condemnation
award
is
issued.
that
award
establishes
the
price
of
the
property.
if
the
government
wants
the
property
at
that
price,
it
pays
the
condemnation
award,
and
at
that
moment
takes
both
the
title
and
the
right
to
possession
of
the
property.
the
sale,
the
taking
occurs
when
the
property
and
the
money
change
hands.
this
straight
condemnation
procedure
is
the
one
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
ordinarily
the
procedure
that
is
least
intrusive
from
the
landowner's
point
of
view,
because
it
permits
him
to
remain
in
possession
until
the
price
is
determined
and
paid
in
full.
in
1931,
congress
added
a
provision
permitting
the
government
to
obtain
immediate
title
and
possession
by
filing
a
declaration
of
taking.
when
that
declaration
is
filed,
usually
at
the
same
time
as
the
complaint
but
not
necessarily,
that
establishes
the
sale
date.
in
rare
instances
when
the
government
has
entered
into
possession
before
it
files
a
declaration
of
taking,
the
date
that
it
assumes
possession
is
the
date
of
the
sale.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
the
declaration
of
taking.
what
happens
in
the
declaration
of
taking
situation
is
that
the...
since
the
date
of
sale
is
the
date
of
the
taking,
the...
when
the
declaration
of
taking
is
filed,
the
owner
gets
the
estimated
sale
price.
as
part
of
the
declaration
of
taking,
we
have
to
pay
into
court
the
estimated
sale
price.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
is
deposited
into
the
court,
but
rule
71(a)
provides
that
it
shall
be
paid
out
to
the
landowner
promptly.
that's
the
reason
why
he
doesn't
get
interest
on
the
amount
that
has
been
deposited,
because
he
has
that
amount
to
use.
he
gets
interest
only
on
the
extent
to
which
the
actual
award
and
condemnation
is
higher
than
the
estimated
amount.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
on
the
difference
between
the
amount
that
is
deposited--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
is
a
statutory
rate.
we
have
agreed
that
since
interest
is
part
of
just
compensation
in
this
context,
he
is
entitled
to
the
interest
calculated
at
the
actual
interest
rate.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
um-hm.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
there
are...
in
the
eminent
domain
jurisprudence,
it
is
fairly
well
established
that
there
are
collateral
consequences
that
are...
that
may
be
suffered
by
the
landowner
when
eminent...
when
his
property
is
taken.
a
couple
of--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--a
couple
of
examples
would
be
if
he...
his
business
is
destroyed,
if--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes,
i
suppose
financing
problems,
or...
i
mean,
the
collateral
consequences
really
are
the...
they
relate
to
the
particular
value
of
this
property
to
the
landowner.
the
fact
that...
well,
i
suppose
if
you
have
a
profitable
business
that
is
condemned
because
it
is
in
the
way
of
a
throughway.
the
condemnation
award
for
that
business
is
exactly
the
same
whether
the
business
is
profitable
or
whether
it
is
a
losing
business.
obviously,
if
the
landowner
is
losing
money,
the
value
to
him
of
the
business
is
going
to
be
smaller
than
if
it
is
a
very
profitable
business.
on
the
other
hand,
since
eminent
domain
deals
with
transferrable
value,
what
the
government
gets
is
the
property.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
find
it
very
hard
to
think
of
any,
and--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--i
suppose
that
could
be
a...
well,
no,
that's
the
kind
of
consequence...
i
mean,
that
could
be
a
situation
where
you
would
have
a
taking
by
inverse
condemnation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
what
i
was
thinking
of
was
if
the
landowner
owns
property
in
the
middle
of
a
project,
and
the
government
takes
the
property...
takes
the
property
all
around
it
so
that
he
can't
get
into
his
property.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but
our
basic
point
really
is
that
those
kinds
of
damages
are...
they
are
damages
that
are
unrelated
to
the
standard
procedures
for
inverse
condemnation,
where
the
government
comes
in
and
says,
we're
going
to
take
the
property,
and
files
their
complaint,
and
then
the
commission
determines
the
value
of
the
property.
the
government
then
takes
the
property
at
the...
when
it
pays
the
judgment.
it
may
be
that
the
landowner
says,
look,
you've
taken
an
interest
in
my
land,
you've
cut
off
access,
you've
taken...
you
have
affected
my
interest
in
the
property.
that
is
a
completely
different
suit.
the
tucker
act
provides...
that
is
a
suit
that
rests
on
a
claim
arising
under
the
constitution.
that
is
a
tucker
act
suit.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
an
inverse
condemnation
claim.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
in
the...
in
the--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--that's--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--that
is
our
suggestion,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
some
sense
yes,
it
is...
i
mean,
it
is...
this
is
a
tough
question.
as
i
say,
it
is
not
in
this
case,
because
in
this
case
there
is
no
legitimate
claim
of
any
inverse
condemnation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--that
is
absolutely
right.
my
only
point
is
that
what--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--our
point
is
that
when...
what
you
have
in
the...
under
your
tucker
act,
you
go
into
the
court
of
claims,
and
the
court
of
claims
then
has
to
decide
what
you
are
asserting...
whether
what
you
are
asserting
are
legitimate
inverse
condemnation
claims
or
whether
they
are
simply
collateral
consequences,
and
that,
if
they
are
collateral
consequences,
you
don't
get
any
recovery
for
them.
if
they
are
legitimate
inverse
condemnation
claims,
then
you
do
get
a
recovery.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
problem
is
that
congress
has
said
that
claims
arising
under
the
constitution
against
the
united
states
are
to
be
tried
in
the
court
of
claims
only
if
they
are
over
$10,000.
that
is
a
jurisdictional
decision
that
congress
has
made.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
did
say
that
under
some
kind
of
a
pendent
jurisdiction
notice,
and
conceivably
you
could,
what
this
would
do
would
be
to
complicate
your
condemnation
proceeding
very
substantially,
and
in
some
sense
the
fact
that
these
two
kinds
of
claims
involve
the
same
property
is
really
coincidental,
that
what
the
condemnation
suit
is
is
a
pricing
action.
the
government
is
looking
to
get
a
price
for
the
property.
what
the
inverse
condemnation
suit
is
is
a
claim
by
the
landowner
that
you
have
done
things
to
my
property,
or
you
have
done
things
to
my
interests
that
affect
my
rights
with
the
property.
that
is
what
has
happened
beforehand.
the
eminent
domain
proceeding
is
for
the
government
to
find
out
how
much
it
is
going
to
cost
for
them
to
purchase
the
property.
they
are
two
separate
questions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
or
whatever--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--yes,
it
is
simply
a
valuation
situation.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
as
i
say,
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
pendent
jurisdiction,
but
my
main
point
is
that
what
the
landowner
has
to
show
in
his
inverse
condemnation
suit
is
something
that
is
far
beyond
anything
that
the
landowner
here
has
even
started
to
show.
it
is
something
beyond
these
consequential
damages.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
certainly
is.
the--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
what
the
petitioner
is
claiming
is
that
he
has
got
a
cloud
on
his
title,
that
the
cloud
really
kind
of
arises
gradually,
it
starts
at
the
point
when
the
interest
in
acquiring
the
land
focuses
and,
you
know,
before
the
statutes
passed
it
kind
of
increases
as
the
statute
is
passed,
and
then
when
the
land
is
identified
and
finally
when
the
condemnation
suit
proceeds.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
and
they
remained
in
possession
all
that
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
in
fact
they
were...
the
government
entered
into
possession
and
filed
a
declaration
of
taking,
it
had
to
make
a
payment
at
that
point,
and
to
the
extent
that
that
payment
didn't
cover
the
amount
that
was
actually
ultimately
determined,
then
the
landowners
were
entitled
to
interest,
but
absent
any
such
payment
or
entry
into
possession,
the
landowners
under
the
federal
scheme
remain
in
possession.
they
retain
all
the
rights
to
use
their
property.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
point
is,
this
cloud
on
the
title,
it
may
as
a
practical
matter
affect
what
the
landowner
can
do,
but
that
will
be
simply
because
of
the
subjective
reactions
of
the
landowner
and
the
people
that
he
wants
to
deal
with.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
i
really--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
in
the
real
world,
it
may,
and
the--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--but...
well,
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
in
his
real
world,
he
has
held
this
property
since
at
least
1949,
and
the
only
difference...
he
has
never
cut
the
timber.
he
has
never
tried
to
develop
it.
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
any
interest
or
use
he
has
made
of
the
land
is
exactly
the
same
until
we
take
the
title
and
the
possession.
of
course,
his
point
that
all
we
want
is
to
preserve
the
land
is
quite
incorrect,
because
what
we
want
is
to
establish
a
public
park
in
which
there
will
be
public
access,
and
we
don't
achieve
that
purpose
until
we
pay
the
money
and
get
the
possession
and
the
title.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
is
a
cloud
on
the
title.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
in
some
cases--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--in
some
cases,
it
may
be
a
damage,
but
the
point
is
that
in
other
cases,
the
landowner
may
vastly
prefer
to
remain
in
possession
rather
than
to
be
put
out
of
possession.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
he
can
sell
it.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
i
doubt
that
anybody
would
come
to
him.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--sure
he
could
sell
it.
absolutely.
and--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--what
i
understand
it
to
mean
is
that
there
is
going
to
be...
people
are
going
to
act
as
though
the
landowner
can't...
i
mean,
they
will
be
less
willing
to
buy
and
sell,
or
they
will
be
less
willing
to
deal
with
it.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
oh,
no,
no,
no,
absolutely
not.
the
other
point
is
that
since
under
our
theory
and
under
the
established
principles
the
title
to
the
land
and
the
value...
the
valuation
date
is
the
date
that
the
taking
occurs,
we
agree
that
if
in
fact
between
the
date
of
valuation
here
in
1979
and
the
date
that
the
land
was
actually
taken
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
value
of
the
land,
then
the
landowner
is
entitled
to
show
that
increase,
either
by
a
motion
under
rule
60(b)
asking
for
relief
from
the
judgment,
or
he
can
also
go
in
under
rule
71(a)
and
ask
that
it
is
no
longer
equitable
because
of
the
delays
to
permit
the
judgment
to
be
executed.
but
the
point
is,
if
you
have...
and
you
can...
if
the
land
has
increased
in
value,
he
can
show
that,
because
he
is
entitled
to
just
compensation
at
the
date
of
taking,
but
to
say
that,
well,
interest
is
kind
of
a
rough
equivalent
of
that
is
just
wrong,
because
what
you
have
to
look
at
in
deciding
whether
he
has
gotten
just
compensation
is
whether
land
prices
have
increased,
not
what
has
happened
to
the
value
of
money.
interest
rates
have
got
nothing
to
do
with
his
just
compensation
claim,
which
is
to
recover
the
current
value
of
the
property.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
if
the
government
is
taking,
but
our
point
is
that
in
straight
condemnation
cases
of
course
we
haven't
taken
until
we
pay
the
judgment.
but
what
he
is
saying
is,
look,
i've
got...
back
in
'79
the
land
may
have
been
worth
less
than
it
was
in
'82,
so
i
am
entitled
to
interest
to
make
up
the
difference
between
what
the
land
was
worth
in
'79
and
what
it
was
worth
in
'82,
but
if
he
can
show
that
the
land
was
worth
more
in
'82,
then
indeed
he
is
entitled
to
what
the
land
is
worth
in
'82,
when
we
take
it,
and
interest
is
totally
unrelated
to
that.
the
landowner...
petitioner
relies
largely
on
this
court's
decisions
involving
the
police
power
on
land
use
regulation.
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
in
those
cases
the
court
has
required
a
far
more
serious
invasion
of
property
rights
than
petitioner
has
suffered
before
it
has
found
a
constitutional
taking.
it
is
worth
emphasizing
that
even
if
the
question
were
closer
than
we
think
it
is,
there
are
serious
practical
problems
in
carrying
out
the
case
by
case
analysis
used
in
land
use
cases
in
the
context
of
condemnation
proceedings,
so
that
the
date
of
taking
must
be
litigated
in
each
case.
that
brings
in
idiosyncratic
values
and
potential
complications
in
determining
the
date
of
valuation
that
would
seriously
complicate
an
already
complex
process.
there
is
a
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
cases
that
justifies
treating
them
differently.
when
the
government
is
exercising
its
eminent
domain
powers,
it
recognizes
the
landowner's
right
to
just
compensation.
the
dispute
is
simply
over
how
that
just
compensation
should
be
calculated,
not
over
whether
the
property
owner
is
entitled
to
any
payment
at
all.
the
government
should
be
allowed
more
leeway
when
it
is
establishing
parks
and
preserving
scenic
values
by
condemning
land
and
paying
for
it
than
when
it
tries
to
achieve
the
same
results
by
zoning
and
imposing
the
burdens
on
the
landowner
without
paying
him
anything.
mayen
and
dow
recognize
that,
and
the
dissent
in
penn
central
certainly
sounds
as
though
the
dissenters
would
have
agreed
with
the
majority
that
there
was
no
taking
if
the
complaint
there
had
involved
simply
temporary
interferences
in
the
course
of
a
condemnation
proceeding.
long
delays
in
paying
condemnation
awards
of
course
may
hurt
landowners,
but
they
are
not
the
helpless
victims
that
petitioner
portrays.
first,
because
the
landowner
is
entitled
to
the
fair
market
value
at
the
time
his
land
is
taken,
he
is
entitled
to
show
that
the
land
has
increased
in
value
since
the
original
valuation
date.
that
showing
shouldn't
require
a
complicated
supplementary
hearing.
indeed,
it
is
probably
going
to
be
possible
often
to
negotiate
a
stipulation
because
all
that
will
be
involved
is
whether
comparable
real
estate
values
have
gone
up.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true,
but
the
point
is
that
it's...
what
you
have
to
be
concerned
about
is
the
market
value
of
the
land,
and
not
the
interest
rate,
and
our
point
is
that
the
proceeding
is
not
probably
going
to
be
a
very
complicated
one.
what
you
are
talking
about
is
land
values.
you
don't
have
to...
petitioner
suggests
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
start
the
whole
proceeding
over
again.

it
is
the
commission's--
ms.

s.

--yes.
so
that...
but
as
i
say,
it
shouldn't
be
a
complicated
determination
to
make.
and
the
other
point
is
that
if
the
land
values
have
gone
up
very
steeply,
the
payment
of
interest
isn't
going
to
afford
the
landowner
just
compensation.
on
the
other
hand,
where
the
land
values
have
dropped,
as
it
may
well
be
they
have
here,
the
interest
will
give
the
landowner
a
windfall.
if
the
landowner
can't
show
that
the
land
has
appreciated,
he
can
also
move
to
dismiss
the
condemnation
suit
under
rule
71(a).
if
the
district
court
agrees
that
the
government's
delay
has
been
unreasonable,
it
can
dismiss
the
suit,
and
the
government
must
then
pay
the
landowner's
litigation
costs,
including
attorneys'
fees.
that
is
under
the
uniform
relocation
assistance
and
land
acquisition
policies
act.
a
landowner
in
petitioner's
position
has
a
third
alternative.
it
is
pretty
clear
that
if
the
park
service
had
concluded
that
he
was
seriously
considering
cutting
his
timber,
the
government
would
have
filed
a
declaration
of
taking,
and
at
that
point,
of
course,
we
would
have
had
to
deposit
the
estimated
value
of
the
property,
and
he
would
then
have
become
entitled
to
interest,
just
as
he
claims
now
that
he
is,
so
that
he
had
it
within
his
power
to
get
an
immediate
taking
if
that
was
what
he
wanted.
unless
there
are
further
questions.
