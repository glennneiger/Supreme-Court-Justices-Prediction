mr.
joe
g.
roady
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
fifth
amendment
taking
in
just
compensation
case.
it
arose
under
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
imminent
domain
by
the
united
states
under
title
40,
section
257
of
the
united
states
code.
that
is
the
so-called
straight
condemnation
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
condemnation
was
to
preserve
a
wilderness
area
in
fast
texas
in
the
big
thicket
forest
area
of
that
region
of
the
state.
authority
for
that
particular
condemnation
was
given
by
congress
in
title
16,
section
698
of
the
united
states
code.
we
want
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
the
importance
of
the
purpose
of
this
particular
condemnation
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
purpose
was
to
preserve
a
wilderness
in
its
pristine
condition.
that
is
a
purpose
which
is
accomplished
by
affecting
a
non-use,
a
non-use
for
economic
purposes,
a
non-use
for
any
purpose
inconsistent
with
the
wilderness
preservation,
and
in
this
respect
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
purpose
was
accomplished
at
the
time
that
the
condemnation
was
filed.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
there
were
no
acts
of
physical
possession,
your
honor.
what
we...
excuse
me.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
there
were
no
acts
of
physical
possession.
what
we
are
submitting
to
this
court
is
that
consistent
with
the
takings
analysis
which
this
court
has
made
in
the
police
power
cases,
the
burdens
which
were
placed
upon
the
ownership
interests
in
this
property
were
such
that
a
taking
occurred
prior
to
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
award
and
condemnation.
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
as
a
legal
matter,
your
honor,
we
could
sell
the
property,
but
it
would
have
to
be
subject
to
the
condemnation.
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--you
could
not,
and
that
is--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--not
only
unlikely,
your
honor.
we
think
it
would
be
a
practical
and
economic
impossibility.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
no,
sir,
your
honor,
we
could
not.
that
is
another
one
of
the
slices
through
the
bundle
of
ownership
rights
that
we
have
in
this
property
that
this
action
made.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
you
could,
your
honor,
but
you
could
not
recover
the
cost
of
it
once
the
united
states
has
completed
its
condemnation.
you
would
lose
that
money.
you
could
not
borrow
the
money
to
build
the
house
on
it.
you
could
not
borrow
the
money
to
develop
it.
you
could
not
sell
it
as
far
as
the
timber
or
any
natural
resources
on
it
were
concerned.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
i
would
submit
not,
your
honor,
because
what
the
secured
interest
owner
would
look
to
would
be
the
property,
and
the
property
is
at
that
time
in
a
state
of
limbo
insofar
as
the
award
is
concerned.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
my
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
true.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
the
bank,
if
it
had
the
lien
before
the
condemnation
was
filed,
is
protected,
but
if
the
bank
were...
excuse
me.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
is--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--it
is
security
to
the
extent
of
the
value
that
may
be
realized
in
the
condemnation,
and
that
is
the
problem.
there
is
no
certainty
that
the
value
which
will
be
realized
in
the
condemnation
is
the
value
which
the
bank
had
put
on
it
pursuant
to
its
appraisal,
because
the
condemnation--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--well,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
the
practical
burdens
which
are
placed
upon
the
property
by
the
condemnation
process
are
such
that
viable
economic
uses
are
no
longer
available.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
the
position
we
are
taking
before
this
court
as
a
matter
of
the
legal
impact
relating
to
condemnation
proceedings.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
the
property
was
not
being
put
to
any
economic
use,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
it
was
held
by
a
timber
manufacturing
company
in
a
reserve
capacity.
that
is
to
say,
it
would
look
to
the
property
at
some
future
date
either
for
the
cutting
of
the
timber,
the
sale
of
the
timber,
the
sale
of
the
property
for
development,
some
purpose,
but
those
matters
had
not
yet
been
formulated.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
no,
sir,
we
are
not
receiving
interest
on
the
property,
but
that
is
really
not
the
question.
the
question
is,
when
did
the
government
take
the
property.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that's
true.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
well--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--your
honor,
respectfully,
i
wouldn't
say
that
those
were
viable
economic
uses.
they
may
be
recreational
uses,
but--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--in
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment,
we
are
talking
about
just
compensation,
and
i
think
that
implies
economic
uses.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
they
do,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
the
land
could
be
leased
for
hunting
and
some
income
derived
from
that.
however,
that
was
not
being
done
in
this
case,
and--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
that
is
my
understanding.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
even
for
hunting
is
my
understanding.
i
don't
know
that
that's--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--we
submit
that
that
would
not
have
been
possible,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
government
would
have
intervened.
they
have
suggested
as
much
in
their
briefs
before
this
court.
second
of
all,
and
i
am
not
certain
that
this
is
in
the
record,
but
i
think
it
is
a
fact
which
can
be
noted,
the
big
thicket
preserve
was
a
cause
celebre
of
the
group
in
southeast
texas
which
meant
to
and
wanted
to
preserve
the
big
thicket
forest.
there
were
people
who
were
constantly,
and
i
would
say
representing
the
public
in
that
respect,
and
certainly
after
congress
enacted
this
legislation
in
1974,
they
were
closely
watching
what
was
happening
to
these
tracts
of
land
to
prevent
just
what...
the
question
involved.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that's
correct,
prior--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--not
entirely,
your
honor.
what
we
did
was--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--as
a
good
faith
effort--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--to
demonstrate
to
congress
that
kirby
wanted
to
be
a
good
citizen
and
not
out--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--it
did
not
oppose
the
legislation,
your
honor.
it
did
not
support
it
as
others
did.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
which
undertaking,
your
honor?
mr.
joe
g.
roady
it
is
an
admitted
fact.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
mentioned
in
the
record
specifically.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
to
a
great
degree,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
the
only
distinction,
your
honor,
is
that
in
a
257
case
involving
land
which
has
income-producing
capabilities
and
is
producing
income,
that
situation
does
not
fit
as
readily
into
this
court's
taking
analysis
under
the
police
power
cases,
that
is,
those
cases
which
say
that
there
is
no
taking
when
there
is
remaining,
such
as
in
agins
against
city
of
tiburon,
a
viable
economic
use.
if
there
is
a
viable
economic
use,
there
may
yet
be
the
burden
on
the
title,
on
the
ownership
interest,
as
is
present
in
an
unimproved
property
situation.
and
so,
yes,
there
may
yet
be
a
taking
in
an
improved
property
situation
as
an
unimproved.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
correct.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
the
texas
forestry
association,
as
a
group,
indicated
to--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--no,
sir.
this
was
a
group
of
timbermen,
owners
and
manufacturers
which
indicated
to
the
representatives
of
the
interior
department
and
the
congressmen
who
were
involved
in
pushing
the
act
through
to
passage.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
i
would
say
not,
your
honor,
would
be
my
supposition.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
i
would
make
the
same
arguments
if
there
were
no
such
agreement,
your
honor.
i
have
referred--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--yes.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
correct.
yes,
sir.
i
would
indeed
say
that.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
your
honor,
our
position
relating
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
that
was
the
moment
when
the
federal
government
asserted
in
a
positive
public
way
its
intent
to
take
the
property.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
true.
we
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
government
to
back
out
of
a
condemnation
once
it
has
been
filed
under
section
257.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
this,
your
honor,
was
the
impediment
on
the
legal
interests
which
had
not
existed
before.
at
the
same
time,
the
government
filed
a
notice
of
lis
pendence.
the
effect
of
those
two
circumstances
was
to
place
a
barrier
around
the
titles,
around
the
economic
uses
which
might
be
made
of
this
property.
it
was
at
that
moment,
looking
at
the
line
of
cases
that
have
said
there
may
be
a
series
of
events
which,
once
there
is
a
certainty
that
the
government
is
going
to
move
forward
in
this
respect,
reaches
a
taking
level.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
your
honor,
the
lis
pendence
is
the
confirmation
in
the
public
record
in
addition
to
the
condemnation
petition
itself
that
the
government
is
going
forward
with
its
intent
to
take.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
correct.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
practical
impediments
to
the
economic
use
of
the
property
were
such
that
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
after
the
posting
of
the
lis
pendence
notice
rendered
all
economic
use
unavailable,
and
this
within
this
court's
police
power
taking
analysis
demonstrates
that
the
burdens
which
the
property
has
not
borne
before
had
reached
the
level
that
a
taking
occurred.
now,
one
of
the
vital
questions
in
this
case,
and
one
which
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
addressed
before
authoritatively
is
the
question
of
what
is
a
taking
in
a
section
257
case
absent
physical
possession?
is
it
the
accrual
of
the
title
of
the
government,
or,
on
the
other
hand,
is
it
the
deprivation
of
the
interest
of
the
landowner?
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
the
deprivation
of
the
interest
of
the
landowner.
in
this
case,
and
this
is
the
reason
i
emphasized
the
purpose
of
the
condemnation
here,
is
it
the
effective
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
the
condemnation
which
is
the
taking?
in
this
case,
that
is
what
we
contend.
if
the
taking
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
payment
of
the
award,
then
that
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
it
is
the
accrual
of
the
title
of
the
government
rather
than
the
deprivation
of
the
interest
of
the
landowner
which
is
the
test
of
the
taking.
as
the
court
is
aware,
there
is
a
conflict
on
this
question
between
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
circuits,
the
fifth
court
in
our
case,
the
ninth
circuit
in
two
separate
cases.
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
in
one
case
the
date
of
the
judgment
was
the
date
of
taking,
and
in
the
other
case
that
the
date
of
evaluation
of
the
property
was
the
date
of
taking.
the
court
in
our
case
followed
the
danforth
decision,
the
1939
decision
of
this
court,
in
holding
that
it
was
the
date
of
the
payment
of
the
award.
the
problem
with
that
situation
as
applied
to
this
case
is
that
property
was
valued
in
march
of
1979.
the
award
was
not
paid
until
march
of
1952,
a
three-year
gap.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
judgment
was
in
august
of
1981,
seven
months
prior
to
the
payment
of
the
award.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
your
honor,
because
that
was
the
date
of
the
beginning
of
the
hearings
before
the
commission.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
beginning
date
of
the
hearings
before
the
commission
was
the
date
of
taking.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
date
of
taking
was
the
language
used.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
well,
there
is
disagreement--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--we
do,
your
honor.
there
is
disagreement
not
only
among
the
parties,
but
among
the
courts
as
to
the
effect
of
the
stipulation.
the
fifth
circuit
rejected
it
as
being
merely
an
agreement
as
to
the
date
of
valuation
rather
than
date
of
taking.
the
district
court
ignored
it
and
found
that
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
the
date
of
taking.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
true,
your
honor.
there
was
consideration
made
of
arguing
that
the
date
of
the
passage
of
the
act
was
the
date
of
taking.
however,
in
the
legislative
history,
it
was
clear
that
there
had
been
a
provision
providing
for
a
declaration
of
taking
which
was
removed
during
the
legislative
process,
even
though
the
act
itself
states
that
there
is
hereby
created
the
big
thicket
national
preserve,
which
would
indicate
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
legislatively
declare
that
this
property
was
going
to
be
taken
and
preserved.
there
are
a
number
of
constitutional
principles
involved
in
this
particular
matter.
we
want
to
emphasize
four.
the
first
is
that
the
word
"property"
in
the
fifth
amendment
refers
to
ownership
interest,
and
not
to
the
physical
property
itself.
this
question
was
authoritatively
decided
in
united
states
against
general
motors.
the
second
is
that
a
taking
does
not
require
physical
invasion
or
appropriation
or
passage
of
title.
this
proposition
has,
we
think,
also
been
affirmatively
and
authoritatively
decided,
most
recently
in
penn
central
transportation
against
the
city
of
new
york,
and
justice
brennan's
dissent,
which
may
very
well
have
represented
a
majority
point
of
view
in
that
case,
and
san
diego
gas
and
electric
against
city
of
san
diego.
the
third,
and
the
one...
one
of
the
two
which
we
want
to
emphasize
to
the
greatest
extent,
is
that
value
is
to
be
determined
as
of
the
date
of
taking.
that
is
a
constitutional
mandate
much
supported
by
and
announced
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
but
not,
very
candidly,
observed
in
practice.
the
problems
are,
you
must
have
a
date
of
valuation
at
some
point
during
the
process
of
condemnation.
that
date
will
always
be
before
the
date
of
the
payment
of
the
award.
if
the
date
of
the
payment
of
the
award
is
determined
then
to
be
the
date
of
taking,
you
cannot
have
a
coincident
date
of
valuation
and
date
of
taking.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
true,
your
honor,
depending
on
the
fluctuations
in
the
marketplace,
but
we
contend
before
this
court
that
what
should
be
the
rule
is
a
fair
rule
to
all
landowners
irrespective
of
the
fluctuations
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
the
significance,
your
honor,
is
in
reliance
on
the
danforth
decision.
the
danforth
case
held
that
the
date
of
the
payment
of
the
award
was
the
date
of
taking
unless
there
had
been
some
taking
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that's
when
title
passes.
that's
when--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--that
title
passes?
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is
the
universal
practice.
that's
when
title
passes,
when
the--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--yes,
your
honor,
because
of
the
constitutional--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--no,
it
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
your
honor.
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
no
taking
shall
occur
without
just
compensation,
meaning
that
the
government
cannot
take
the
title
until
it
pays
just
compensation.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
not
so,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
enjoin
in
the
legal
sense.
it
certainly
enjoins
in
the
practical
sense.
we
may
have
the
ownership
rights,
but
they
have
been
sliced
through
by
the
actions
of
the
government
in
prohibiting
or
preventing,
rather,
the
economic
use
of
the
property.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
rule
71(a)
provides
that
at
any
time
before
the
payment
of
the
award,
the
government
may
withdraw.
however,
if
it
is
after
the
evaluation,
it
is
subject
to
court
approval,
and
subject
to
the
court
adjusting
the
situation
for
a
just
compensation.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
sir?
mr.
joe
g.
roady
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joe
g.
roady
in
the
interim,
and
they
are
paid
by
the
landowner
rather
than
the
government.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
that
is...
that
continues
to
be
true,
yes,
because
title
does
not
pass
until
the
payment
of
the
award.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
your
honor's
analysis
is
correct.
there
are
two
methods
whereby
the
government
is
authorized
to
proceed
in
condemnation.
however--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
as
justice
brennan
suggested
in
his
dissent
in
san
diego
gas
and
electric,
that
when
a
taking
occurs,
there
is
an
automatic
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pay
just
compensation.
that
taking
may
be
temporary.
the
government
may
in
that
respect
back
out
of
the
condemnation
before
it
pays
the
award,
and
in
that
respect,
it
has
had
the
opportunity
to
test
the
marketplace,
to
see
whether
it
wants
to
condemn
this
property
at
the
price
that
has
been
determined.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
if
it
is
irrevocable,
then
it
is
clear
that
the
government
is
not
going
to
back
out,
but
we
do
not
deny
or
contest
the
right
of
the
government
to
back
out.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
well,
your
honor,
in
a
larger
sense
it
was
irrevocable,
because
congress
directed
that
the
property
be
taken.
this
particular
property
was
isolated
as
being
of
the
highest
wilderness
value
in
the
entire
big
thicket
forest.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
respectfully,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
was
a
commitment.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
no,
your
honor.
what
i
say
is
that
if
there
is
a
temporary
taking,
then
the
government
must
pay
the
cost
of
that
temporary
taking.
it
does
not...
it
is
not
compelled
to
complete
the
taking
if
it
chooses
section
257.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
that
is--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--yes,
that
is
consistent
with
our
position.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
yes,
please,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
g.
roady
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
paramount
power
of
the
government
to
take
property.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
that
does
not
occur
until
it
exercises
possession
or
control
over
the
landowner's
property.
that
position,
we
submit
to
the
court,
is
totally
contrary
to
this
court's
own
analyses
of
the
takings
questions
in
police
power
cases.
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
a
separate
analysis
might
well
be
given
to
eminent
domain
cases,
as
i
think
is
appropriate,
but
in
that
separate
analysis
it
would
be
clear
that
the
character
of
the
taking,
the
character
of
the
government
action
which
was
being
analyzed
is
this
paramount
power
to
take.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissent
in
san
diego
gas
and
electric
noted
in
a
footnote
that
where
the
property
is
to
remain
unused,
undisturbed,
and
in
its
natural
state,
paraphrasing,
in
this
sense,
the
property
is
being
used
by
the
public.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
principles
which
were
announced
in
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
that
case
are
applicable
to
the
analysis
which
should
be
made
of
the
power
of
the
government
to
take
in
eminent
domain
cases.
the
court...
excuse
me.
the
government
relies
on
the
danforth
decision.
danforth
does
not
support
the
absolutist
position
taken
by
the
government.
danforth
held
that
a
taking
could
occur
in
actuality
before
the
payment
of
the
award.
it
also
held
that
in
order
for
an
act
of
the
government
to
amount
to
a
taking,
it
must
result
in
an
appropriation
of
the
property
to
the
uses
of
the
government.
that
is
precisely
what
has
happened
here.
this
property
was
appropriated
to
the
uses
of
the
government,
was
being,
in
effect,
used
by
the
public
because
of
its
preservation
in
a
natural
state.
the
government
suggests
that
we
should
go
through
an
inverse
condemnation
process.
i
submit
that
that
is
totally
inappropriate.
what
we
have
is
a
just
compensation
question
under
the
fifth
amendment.
to
relegate
the
taxpayer,
the
landowner
to
the
court
of
claims
is
to
divide
the
just
compensation
issue.
if
the
government
withdraws
its
condemnation,
and
is
allowed
to
do
so
by
the
district
court,
then
there
may
be
an
inverse
condemnation
question,
but
once
the--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--we
have
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
rate
is
a
question
which
should
be
discussed
in
this
case.
it
should
be
a
market
rate.
i
think
the
government--
mr.
joe
g.
roady
--i
do
indeed,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
