unknown
speaker
mr.
roady--
unknown
speaker
--was
it
accomplished
by
virtue
of
the
government
exercising
dominion
over
the
property
from
the
time
you
state?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
finish
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
when
the
action
was
taken
by
the
government,
could
you
sell
the
property
to
me
or
to
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
of
the
table?
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
economic
matter--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
be
unlikely
that
you
could
find
a
buyer
who
would
take
that
chance.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
could
borrow
money
at
the
bank
on
it?
unknown
speaker
could
this
unimproved
real
estate,
could
you...
do
you
think
you
could
build
a
house
on
it,
or
a
building?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't...
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you
wanted
to
borrow
money
from
the
bank
on
the
same
type
of
security
that
that
unimproved
property
would
have
afforded
you
for
whatever
loan
a
bank
might
make
on
it
before
the
condemnation
action
was
filed,
couldn't
you
borrow
money
on
the
strength
of
the
potential
award?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
experience
has
been
that
banks
aren't
crazy
about
unsecured
property,
whether
it
is...
unimproved
property,
whether
they
are
subject
to
condemnation
proceedings
or
not,
but
are
you
saying
the
banks
in
that
part
of
the
country
would
be
less
likely
to
treat
as
security
the
potential
award
on
the
property
than
the
property
itself.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
a
lien
on
the
property,
and
then
the
property
is
condemned,
surely
the
lienholder
is
going
to
get
paid
if
the
award
is
large
enough.
unknown
speaker
and
i
think
a
bank
would
certainly
know
that.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
bank
says
before
the
condemnation,
this
property
has
got
a
market
value
of
x
dollars,
we'll
loan
you
x
over
two
dollars
on
it,
and
after
they
know
it
is
going
to
be
condemned,
isn't
the
property
just
as
good
as
security?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
just
as
good
as
security?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
certainty
any
time
about
that.
when
the
bank...
if
a
bank
appraises
property
before
a
condemnation
and
says,
we
think
it
will
bring
so
much,
and
so
we
will
loan
you
half
that
much,
they
don't
really
know
about
their...
how
right
they
are
about
the
value.
unknown
speaker
so
when
do
those
restraints
accrue,
in
your
view?
when
the
condemnation
action
is
filed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roady--
unknown
speaker
--what
economic
use
was
the
property
put
to
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
if
your
client
were
to
receive
interest
from
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
would
that
not
be
a
windfall
there?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
receiving
any
interest
now,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
your
argument
is,
as
i
understood
it,
that
from
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
there
was
no
further
economic
use
to
which
the
property
could
be
put--
unknown
speaker
--and
be
profitable.
unknown
speaker
they
could
still
go
hunting
on
it,
fishing...
what
they
were
doing
on
it
now.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
in
texas,
don't
people
pay
to
hunt
down
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
weren't
getting
any
income
off
of
it.
unknown
speaker
even
for
hunting.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
potential
income
on
inflation?
capital
gains.
perhaps
that
is
out...
off
the
field,
but
let
me
ask
you
this.
could
they
put...
the
owner
put
a
timber
crew
in
and
start
cutting
the
timber?
unknown
speaker
did
i
read
in
your
brief
or
in
somebody's
brief
that
your
client
agreed
not
to
develop
the
timber?
unknown
speaker
during
the
process
of
the
passage
of
the
legislation?
unknown
speaker
and
so
i
take
it
that
your
client
was
supporting
passage
of
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
agree
not
to
develop
any
of
the
timber?
unknown
speaker
to
what?
unknown
speaker
so
go
ahead
and
pass
the
legislation.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
this
undertaking
of
yours
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
not
to
develop
the
timber.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roady--
unknown
speaker
--the
facts
that
you
rely
on
here
to
constitute
a
taking,
a
prepayment
taking,
wouldn't
those
same
facts
exist
in
any
section
257
straight
condemnation
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
it
turn
every
257
proceeding
into
a
258
proceeding,
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
may
i
get
back
to
when
it
was
you
made
this
agreement?
it
was
before
the
passage
of
the
act,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
with
whom
did
you
make
it?
unknown
speaker
was
this
the
group
supporting
the
big
thicket?
unknown
speaker
did
your
client
expect
any
compensation
for
that
agreement?
unknown
speaker
does
your
position
hinge
on
that
agreement?
would
you
make
the
same
arguments
if
there
were
no
such
agreement?
unknown
speaker
you
would
make
the
same
arguments
even
if
you
had
this
vast
timber
land
that
was
not
economically
being
developed,
but
you
had
a
right
to
cut
down
the
trees
any
time
you
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
say
that
as
soon
as
they
filed
the
complaint,
you
are
entitled
to
interest.
unknown
speaker
what
was
it
about
the
filing
of
the
complaint
that
prevented
you
from
cutting
down
the
trees
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
prior
agreement?
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
not
a
declaration
of
taking
proceeding.
this
was
straight
condemnation,
and
that
case
that
justice
feed
wrote
a
number
of
years
says
that
one
of
the
things
the
government
is
entitled
to
look
to
in
straight
condemnation
is
whether
it
wants
to
buy
the
property
at
the
price
the
jury
or
the
commissioners
fix.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
i
am
asking
the
same
question
my
brother
rehnquist
did,
but
i
don't
understand
how
the
institution
of
the
condemnation
proceedings
deprived
you
of
anything
when
you
had
agreed
before
the
proceeding
was
begun
not
to
use
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
of
a
lis
pendence
is
in
texas,
but
i
know
that
when
i
practiced
in
arizona,
it
simply
was
to
say,
advise
everyone
that
the
property
was
subject
to
a
condemnation
action.
now,
that
does
not
impair
the
use
of
the
property,
the
filing
of
a
lis
pendence,
any
more
than
the
filing
of
a
condemnation
action.
all
that
does
it
give
the
public
notice
of
the
filing
of
the
condemnation
action.
so
what
has
the
lis
pendence
got
to
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
going
forward
and
proceeding
by
straight
condemnation.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
still
not
satisfied
with
what
you
have
said,
that
there
were
any
other
impediments
on
the
use
of
the
land.
i
think
you
agree
that
if
you
haven't
entered
into
this
other
agreement,
you
would
have
been
free
to
cut
the
timber
on
the
land.
certainly
you
are
free
to
place
a
security
interest
on
the
land,
if
you
could
have
gotten
somebody
to
give
you
a
security
interest
on
the
land.
i
don't
see
how
you
are
impaired
in
the
use
of
the
land
except
the
way
anybody
is
impaired
in
that
you
can't
really
sell
land
after
a
condemnation
action
has
been
filed
because
people
are
just
waiting
to
see
what
the
commissioners
find.
unknown
speaker
when
was
judgment?
unknown
speaker
why
was
the
property
valued
in
whatever
month
it
was
in
'79?
unknown
speaker
was
it
stipulated?
unknown
speaker
was
it
the
date
of
taking
or
the
date
of
evaluation?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn't
a
taking
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
fixed
point
of
reference
for
valuation
purposes?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
you
don't
really
argue
that
they
are
committed
to
that
as
the
date
from
which
interest
must
run.
you
don't
even
argue
that
primarily.
you
argue
the
complaint
date.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
you
stipulated
to
the
date
of
taking
that
you
did
stipulate
to
because
you
didn't
think
you
could
argue
for
any
earlier
date?
or
later.
unknown
speaker
and
that
may
be
very
good
for
some
people
and
very
bad
for
others.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
date
of
payment?
unknown
speaker
right.
what
happens...
why
is
that
the
date
of
payment?
does
title
pass
then?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
that?
is
that
under
case
law,
or
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
as
a
result
of
case
law?
that's
when
the
united
states
title
accrues,
not
at
judgment,
but
at
payment?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
statute,
or
is
that
a
decision?
unknown
speaker
and
so
up
until
that
time,
you
are
the
owner,
and
the
judgment
really
doesn't
enjoin
you
from
doing
anything.
unknown
speaker
could
the
united
states
still
back
out
after
the
date
of
judgment
and
before
the
date
of
payment?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
property
taxes--
unknown
speaker
--are
assessed
in
the
interim?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
property
taxes,
state
property
taxes
are
assessed
in
the
interim.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
by
kirby?
unknown
speaker
and
this
would
be
true
for
the
period
between
judgment
and
payment.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
roady,
that
is
exactly
the
congressional
scheme,
isn't
it,
to
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
have
value
determined
before
it
decides
whether
in
fact
it
wants
to
spend
that
much
money
to
acquire
something
in
condemnation,
and
in
fact
the
government
has
provided
a
speedier
way
for...
the
congress
has
provided
a
speedier
way
for
the
government
to
acquire
property
if
the
government
is
willing
to
go
ahead
with
the
purchase
no
matter
what
the
valuation
might
be.
unknown
speaker
sure,
and
if
we
are
to
agree
with
you,
it
just
means
congress's
separate
schemes
for
condemnation
won't
be
upheld.
you
would
force
the
government
into
immediate
acquisition.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
dealing
with
a
large
public
project,
a
dam
or
a
highway
system,
there
isn't
really
any
backing
out.
the
government
has
committed
itself
to
the
project
at
whatever
price
they
have
to
pay,
even
though
they
can
litigate
it.
i
suppose
the
experience
is
varied.
in
some
of
these
public
projects,
it
may
be
six,
eight,
or
more
years
before...
from
the
time
of
filing
to
the
time
when
the
government
actually
wants
to
flood
the
land
or
take
it
for
a
highway
or
a
bridge,
and
your
argument,
i
take
it,
is
that
there
has
been
something
like
a
constructive
taking
as
soon
as
they
filed.
unknown
speaker
especially
if
it
is
an
irrevocable--
unknown
speaker
--this
case
was
not
irrevocable.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
the
government
did
with
respect
to
your
client's
specific
property
was
to
file
a
straight
condemnation
action
against
it,
which
allows
it
to
elect
after
the
value
has
been
fixed
whether
to
go
ahead
or
not,
so
in
your
case
there
was
no
commitment
prior
to
valuation.
unknown
speaker
then
you
say,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
that
the
distinction
between
straight
condemnation
and
declaration
of
taking
and
that
the
old
opinion
in
the
flood
control
case
by
justice
reed
are
just
no
longer
good
law,
that
the
government
can't
elect
after
it
finds
out
what
the
value
is
to
back
off.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
would
you
take
the
position
that
if
they
had
backed
out
here
after...
right
at
the
last
moment,
they
had
backed
out
and
changed
their
minds,
that
your
client
could
have
received
damages
from
them
under
the
theory
in
justice
brennan's
dissent?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
entitled
either
to
interest
or
damages?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
one
procedure
where
the
money
is
paid
in
and
deposited
in
a
bank?
unknown
speaker
to
the
court,
but
may
they
take
it
out
and
put
it
in
their
own
bank
account?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
important
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
court
deposited
it
in
the
bank.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
the
deferred
payment.
unknown
speaker
--deferred.
unknown
speaker
they
get
interest
at...
is
it
the
statutory
rate?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
shapiro,
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
the
effects
on
it
of
the
government's
condemnation
action
here
were
such
as
to
give
cause
to...
a
cause
of
action
to
them
for
what
amounts
to
inverse
condemnation,
in
effect,
to
force
payment
and
damages
or
alternatively
by
way
of
interest
for
their
loss
suffered
before
date
of
payment.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
your
brief,
you
indicate
that
a
landowner
can
get
damages
on
an
inverse
condemnation
theory
for
adverse
effects
on
the
property
caused
by
the
condemnation
proceedings,
but
only
for
effects
over
and
above
collateral
consequences.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
collateral
consequences?
what
are
those?
it
wasn't
clear
to
me.
unknown
speaker
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
could
there
be
any
collateral
consequences
for
unimproved
realty
that
you
can
think
of?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
there
be
any
so-called
collateral
consequences
in
this
type
situation
for
unimproved
realty?
unknown
speaker
what
if
access
were
cut
off?
would
that
be
a
collateral
consequence?
unknown
speaker
but
there
would
have
to
be
a
remainder
there
for
taking
access.
if
you
take
the
whole
parcel,
by
definition,
the
taking
of
access
isn't
going
to
be
any
harm
to
the
person
whose
entire
property
is
taken.
unknown
speaker
as
is
so
often
the
case
in
highway
construction.
out
right
through
the
middle
of
a
farm
or
a
corner
of
it.
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
inverse
condemnation
suit?
unknown
speaker
and
the
property
owner
has
to
file
an
entirely
separate
suit?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
in
the
condemnation
action
can't
take
account
of
those
damages
in
any
away?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position?
unknown
speaker
has
that
been
determined?
that
seems
like
a
great
burden
to
impose
on
a
landowner.
unknown
speaker
i
am
confused
by
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
perhaps
i
shouldn't
be.
but
i
have
understood
the
collateral
consequences
doctrine
in
the
law
of
just
compensation
to
be
much
like
the
law
of
remote
and
consequential
damages
in
law
of
contracts,
not
that
those
kind
of
damages
could
be
recovered
somewhere
else,
but
that
they
simply
could
not
be
recovered
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that
just
compensation
did
not
include
that
kind
of
damages.
unknown
speaker
so
why
talk
about
bringing
an
action
under
the
tucker
act
for
collateral
consequences?
they
wouldn't
be
recoverable
anyway.
unknown
speaker
but
your
brief
said
they
could
be.
so
i
don't...
you
know,
i
just
don't
understand
this
exchange
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
quite
certain
that
they'd
have
to
file
a
separate
suit,
the
landowner,
which
seems
so
unfair.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
all
the
commissioners
value
is
the
full
fee
interest--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
are
talking
about
a
temporary
taking
or
something
like
that,
you
are
talking
about
something
that
is
measured
by
quite
a
different
measure--
unknown
speaker
--it
does
seem
kind
of
difficult
to
me
if
you
are
talking
about
the
same
piece
of
property,
if
there
is
a
claim
of
another
kind
of
taking,
of
a
taking
of
a
less
than
a
full
fee
interest,
that
the
landowner
would
have
to
file
an
action
separately
in
the
court
of
claims.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
filing
of
the
papers
doesn't
inflict
any
injury
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
we
must
know
as
a
practical
matter
that
that...
that
it
does
damage
the
property
owner.
unknown
speaker
let's
take
a
practical
situation
in
this
area
recently,
highway
66,
which
was
seven,
eight,
nine
years
in
construction.
the
people
whose
homes
and
land
was
being
taken
waited
probably
a
long
time
from
the
date
when
they
knew
they
were
going
to
lose
the
property,
lose
it
in
the
sense
that
it
was
going
to
the
government
for
compensation,
until
the
date
when
they
got
their
money,
and--
unknown
speaker
--no,
many
of
them
were
torn
down
by
the
governmental
action,
demolished
long
before
payment
was
made.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
thank
their
prospects
of
selling
the
property
are
impaired?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
necessarily
true,
mrs.
shapiro?
doesn't
the
mere
institution
of
the
condemnation
proceedings
have
the
effect
of
limiting
the
use
of
the
land?
you
don't
think
so?
unknown
speaker
in
the
real
world,
you
don't
think
so?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
one
your
friend
thinks
he
is
in.

[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
ms.
shapiro,
one
point.
you
say
there
is
no
damage,
but
you
do
admit
there
is
a
cloud
on
the
title.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
damage?
unknown
speaker
or
am
i
just
playing
with
words?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
somebody
comes
to
him
and
says,
i
would
like
to
buy
your
property
for
$18
million,
but
it
has
to
be
done
today.
unknown
speaker
you
think
anybody
would
buy
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
did
come,
then
he
could
sell
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
shapiro,
a
moment
ago
justice
marshall
asked
you
if
there
weren't
a
cloud
on
the
title
as
a
result
of
the
condemnation
proceeding,
and
you
said
yes,
there
was.
what
do
you
understand
in
that
sense
a
cloud
on
the
title
to
mean?
unknown
speaker
people
will
do
what
they
do
when
they
know
a
condemnation
action
is--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
understand
the
cloud
on
the
title
in
that
sense
to
suggest
any
question
about
the
owner's
ability
to
pay
fee
title?
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
he
recovers
interest
from
the
date
of
taking,
if
the
judgment
isn't
paid.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
lay
down
any
rule,
the
government's
situation,
the
fact
that
they
can
agree
on
something.
unknown
speaker
courts
can't
deal
with
the
value.
that
is
determined
by
a
fact-finding
process,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
agree
with
you
that
interest
does
run?
what
about
the
rate?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
that?
