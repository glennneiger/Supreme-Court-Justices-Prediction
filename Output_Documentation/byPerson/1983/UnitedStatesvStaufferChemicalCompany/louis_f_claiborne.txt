mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
whether,
in
carrying
out
periodic
inspections
of
stationary
emissions
sources
under
the
clean
air
act,
epa
may
avail
itself
of
the
help
of
retained
independent
contractors
under
a
provision
of
the
clean
air
act
that
permits
the
use
of
authorized
representatives
of
the
administrator
for
this
purpose.
but
before
reaching
that
question
on
the
merits,
there
is
a
threshold
question,
which
is
whether
epa
was
barred
in
this
particular
suit
from
asserting
the
affirmative
of
the
question
on
the
merits
because
in
an
earlier
suit
arising
out
of
an
attempted
inspection
of
another
plant
belonging
to
the
same
company,
but
located
in
a
different
state
and
a
different
judicial
district,
another
court
of
appeals
had
rejected
that
position.
this
case,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
papers
as
stauffer
ii,
arises
out
of
an
attempted
inspection
of
respondent's
phosphorus
plant
in
tennessee
some
time
in
march
of
1980.
epa
personnel,
accompanied
by
state
officials
and
also
by
retained
independent
contractors,
experts
in
the
field,
sought
entry
to
that
plant.
the
company
refused
entry
to
the
independent
contractors.
negotiations
followed.
an
impasse
was
reached,
and
some
weeks
later,
in
august,
epa
secured
a
warrant
to
enter
the
plant.
that
warrant
specifically
authorized
that
they,
epa
personnel,
be
accompanied
by
the
independent
contractors.
nevertheless,
the
company
again
refused
entry
to
the
contractors.
epa
then
moved
to
hold
the
company
in
contempt
for
disobedience
of
the
warrant,
and
in
turn
the
company
moved
to
have
the
warrant
quashed.
now,
by
this
time
stauffer,
respondent
here,
had
won
this
same
issue
in
a
district
court
in
wyoming,
in
the
tenth
circuit.
this
decision
is
referred
to
in
the
papers
as
stauffer
i.
interestingly,
in
this
case,
the
case
before
the
court
today,
when
it
was
in
the
district
court
it
was
not
argued,
and
indeed
it
seems
to
be
common
ground
that
it
could
not
have
been
argued,
that
stauffer
i
was
any
bar
to
reaching
the
merits
in
the
present
case.
that
is
because
not
only
was
that
district
court
decision
in
stauffer
i
not
final...
indeed,
it
was
appealed...
but
also
because
the
holding
on
the
issue
that
concerns
us
here
was
merely
an
alternative
holding,
and
in
those
circumstances
estoppel
would
not
apply.
accordingly,
the
district
court
in
our
case
considered
the
matter
on
the
merits.
but
it
considered
it
for
several
months,
only
issuing
its
opinion
in
april
1981.
in
the
meanwhile,
two
other
district
courts
elsewhere
had
decided
the
same
issue.
one
was
in
the
fourth
circuit,
what
is
called
the
alcoa
case;
another
was
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
bunker
hill
case.
in
both
instances
the
decision
had
gone
in
favor
of
epa,
allowing
the
use
of
these
independent
contractors
to
perform
or
to
aid
in
the
performing
of
these
inspections.
the
district
court,
noting
this
conflict
among...
the
district
court
in
our
case,
noting
the
conflict
among
these
other
district
court
decisions,
stauffer
i
in
favor
of
the
company,
alcoa
and
bunker
hill
in
favor
of
epa,
determined
to
consider
the
matter
afresh.
in
its
words,
it
was
writing
on
a
clean
slate
in
this
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit.
in
what
can
only
be
fairly
described
as
a
carefully
reasoned
opinion,
the
district
court
rejected
the
company's
arguments
and
held
that
the
statute
does
indeed
permit
epa
to
use
independent
contractors
to
aid
it
in
these
inspections.
the
respondent
obtained
a
stay
and
filed
an
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit.
while
that
appeal
was
pending...
and
it
was
pending
for
some
time,
14
months...
there
were
two
further
developments.
two
of
the
cases
i've
mentioned,
stauffer
i
and
bunker
hill,
were
decided
by
their
respective
courts
of
appeals.
stauffer
i
was
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
favor
of
the
company,
whereas
bunker
hill
was
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
favor
of
epa.
the
government
did
not
seek
certiorari
from
stauffer
i,
that
being
the
first
appellate
decision,
and
obviously
there
was
then
no
inter-circuit
conflict,
and
in
turn
when,
six
months
later,
bunker
hill
was
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit
the
other
way,
that
company
did
not
seek
certiorari
to
this
court.
it
was
against
this
background
that
the
case
was
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
matter
before
the
court
today.
the
court
held,
first,
that
epa
was
collaterally
estopped
by
stauffer
i
from
relitigating
against
the
stauffer
company
the
independent
contractor
issue.
two
judges
of
the
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
so
held.
one
of
those
two
judges
stopped
there.
the
other
went
on
and
reached
the
merits,
holding
against
epa
on
the
merits
as
well.
the
third
judge
disagreed
with
the
estoppel
ruling
but,
reaching
the
merits,
he
likewise
ruled
against
epa.
the
upshot
is
that
the
government
lost
on
both
issues
and,
after
a
hearing
was
denied,
filed
its
petition
of
certiorari
on
both
questions.
i
take
the
estoppel
question
first.
in
light
of
the
argument
just
had,
it
would
be
needless
of
me
to
repeat
the
general
principles
which
mr.
geller
has
fully
and
adequately
outlined.
i
stress
that
here,
as
there,
we're
dealing
with
a
pure
question
of
law.
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
public
law.
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
public
law
that
affects
the
welfare
of
the
general
citizenry.
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
public
law
in
which
a
broad
category
of
competing
operators
are
controlled
by
the
legislation.
we're
dealing
with
a
public
law
that
is
administered
on
a
continuing
basis
by
a
governmental
agency
throughout
the
nation.
now,
in
those
circumstances,
as
mr.
geller
says,
it
is
common
ground,
and
certainly
common
ground
between
counsel
for
stauffer
and
myself,
that
the
rules
of
estoppel
must
be
applied
in
a
more
limited
way
than
would
otherwise
be
true,
i
would
say
with
special
caution;
and
all
the
reasons
with
respect
to
freezing
a
possibly
erroneous
rule
of
law,
burdening
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
with
unnecessary
appeals,
apply
fully
here
as
they
do
in
the
previous
cases.
indeed,
here
no
one
argues
that
epa
should
be
barred
from
relitigating
the
same
issue
against
another
company
merely
because
it
lost
the
first
appellate
court
test
in
stauffer
i.
nor
is
it
argued
that
the
government
is
estopped
because
it
failed
to
petition
for
certiorari
in
stauffer
i.
presumably,
had
it
petitioned
this
court
would
more
likely
than
not
have
denied
that
petition,
there
being
no
conflict
at
the
time,
and
the
denial
of
the
writ
would
have
made
the
decision
no
more,
no
less
final
than
the
failure
to
petition
in
the
first
place.
and
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit's
conflicting
decision
in
bunker
hill,
rendered
after
stauffer
i,
sufficiently
illustrates
the
proposition
that
no
one
suggests
that
the
rule
is
frozen
by
the
first
appellate
decision
in
stauffer
i.
the
only
serious
question
presented
in
this
case
in
this
respect
differing
from
the
previous
case
is
whether
the
original
party,
here
stauffer,
ought
to
be
insulated
nationwide
because
it
won
in
the
first
test
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
it
happens
in
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
after
a
time,
my
answer
must
be
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
say
we
could.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
that
that
follows.
but
it
seems
to
me
illogical
to
draw
a
line
which
permits
the
stauffer
company
to
be
specially
insulated
for
all
time
within
the
tenth
and
the
sixth
circuits
and
not
elsewhere.
now,
we
readily
concede
that
even
in
this
special
context
of
public
law
involved
here,
a
final
judgment
must
afford
the
prevailing
party
some
degree
of
insulation.
there
is
first
the
protection
against
unduly
harassing
repetitive
litigation.
as
we
view
it,
that
is
the
core
of
the
montana
decision,
because
there--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
it
depends
on
the
context,
and
it
may
be
difficult
to
gauge
in
some
circumstances.
but
the
montana
case
illustrates
what
must
have
appeared
to
this
court
as
an
abuse
of
the
attempt
to
relitigate.
there
were
there
two
lawsuits
against
the
state
for
a
refund
in
rapid
succession
by
the
government
contractor,
followed
immediately
by
a
suit
by
the
united
states,
who
had
controlled
and
financed
the
prior
litigation,
which
was
in
important
respect
overlapping
of
not
only
the
facts...
not
only
the
law,
but
the
facts
of
the
two
previous
cases.
that
case
had
been
held
in
the
wings
pending
the
outcome
of
the
state
court
litigation.
the
government
was
satisfied
with
the
result
there,
then
reactivated
its
own
lawsuit.
the
court
viewed
that
sequence
of
lawsuits
as
beyond
the
permissible
bounds.
where
one
draws
the
line
at
the
other
end
does
very
much
depend
on
the
context.
in
the
tax
law,
the
rule
seems
to
be
that
a
determination
of
status
as
exempt
or
otherwise
is
good
only
for
the
given
tax
year.
in
other
contexts,
that
determination
may
be
good
on
a
permanent
basis.
now,
turning
to
not
the
question
of
time
so
much
as
the
extent
to
which
the
first
judgment
insulates
he
who
prevailed
in
that
first
litigation,
we
say
that
the
prevailing
party
ought
to
be
secure
for
the
time
contemplated
by
the
controlling
law
or
contract
against
an
attempt
to
redetermine
the
distinct
right
or
title
or
status
that
was
adjudicated
in
his
favor,
even
though
that
right,
title
or
status
depends
entirely
on
an
overriding
question
of
law,
but
that
he
has
no
vested
right
in
the
underlying
rule
of
law.
he
has
a
vested
right
in
the
resulting
title
or
entitlement
or
right
or
status
which
came
to
him
personally
as
a
result
of
applying
that
rule
of
law,
and
no
challenge
to
that
resulting
title
or
right
can
properly
be
brought
until
its
normal
period
has
expired.
as
i've
suggested,
in
the
tax
law
that
is
one
year.
one
cannot
relitigate
whether
or
not
a
taxpayer
is
or
is
not
owing
certain
taxes
or
is
entirely
exempt
within
the
given
tax
year.
in
the
context
of
the
previous
case,
one
could
never
relitigate
the
question
of
whether
the
68
veterans
are
or
are
not
entitled
to
citizenship.
that
is...
becomes
a
vested
right
in
the
judgment.
but
the
underlying
rule
of
law
that
led
to
that
result
is
fully
open
to
relitigation,
even
as
against
the
same
party
if
occasion
should
arise.
now,
this
is
saying
something
more
than
merely
giving
res
judicata
effect
to
the
first
judgment,
because
that
entitlement
to
citizenship,
for
instance,
in
the
case
of
the
68
veterans,
works
not
only
to
prevent
the
government
from
bringing
another
lawsuit
to
immediately
challenge
the
citizenship,
but
it
prevents
the
government
from
denying
on
a
wholly
separate
lawsuit
the
benefits
that
may
flow
from
citizenship,
even
though
it's
a
quite
distinct
context.
that
is,
it
seems
to
us,
the
same
rule
that
was
applied
in
the
moser
case.
mr.
moser
was
declared
to
be
entitled
to
a
pension
by
applying
a
rule
of
law,
arguably
erroneously.
that
was
secure
against
relitigation.
the
rule
of
law,
however,
which
was
a
matter
of
construing
two
statutes
of
congress
and
nothing
more,
was
something
in
which
he
had
no
vested
right.
his
vested
right
was
in
the
declaration
that
he
was
a
civil
war
pensioner.
how
the
court
got
there
was
not
what
the
judgment
protected
him
against.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
i
must
have
read
the
moser
case
too
quickly.
i
had
thought--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--oh,
well.
i
did
not
dig
deep
enough.
i
don't
know
how
to
explain
that.
as
this
court's
report
recites
the
facts,
mr.
moser...
the
legal
issue
was
whether
his
service
as
a
cadet
at
the
academy
counted
as
far
as
service
towards
the
40
years,
and
that
had
been
determined
in
his
favor
by
the
court
of
claims
in
moser
i.
it
apparently
had
been
redetermined
in
his
favor
in
two
subsequent
cases,
but
in
the
interim
there
had
been
a
conflicting
decision
by
the
court
of
claims
in
someone
else's
case,
and
in
the
third
of
those
cases
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
one
that
reached
this
court,
the
court
of
claims
had
said,
estoppel
prevents
us
from
re-examining
it,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
will
go
on
and
do
so
and
overrule
the
conflicting
case.
this
court
said,
we
don't
reach
the
merits,
we
agree
that
estoppel
bars
it.
but
i
thought
all
that
was
entitlement
to
his
pension
as
a
civil
war
veteran,
rather
than
a
first
world
war
veteran.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
may
be.
i
can't
explain.
at
all
events,
the
distinction
i
seek
to
draw
is
easy
enough
in
cases
like
citizenship,
tax
status,
entitlement
to
a
pension.
it
is
more
difficult
in
the
present
case,
where
the
alleged
exemption
and
the
rule
of
law
seem
to
merge
in
an
almost
indistinguishable
way.
but
the
effort
must
nevertheless
be
to
try
to
preserve
something
for
the
beneficiary
of
the
judgment
without
the
risk
of
stultifying
the
rule
of
law
in
which
may
be
an
erroneous
decision.
here,
therefore,
we're
left
with
two
choices.
one
is
to
say
that
stauffer,
the
stauffer
company,
has
won
a
permanent
exemption
from
inspection
by
epa's
retained
contractors
for
all
its
plants
nationwide
for
all
time;
or
that
what
it
has
truly
won
is
an
exemption
from
the
enforcement
of
a
particular
warrant,
addressed
to
a
particular
inspection
at
a
specific
plant.
faced
with
those
choices--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that,
justice
powell,
i
think
is
the
same
question
in
which
i
gave
an
answer
to
justice
white,
which
is
that--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes.
i
am
driven
to
say
that
after
an
appropriate
lapse
of
time,
even
with
respect
to
the
single
plant,
the
government
cannot
be
estopped.
and
here
the
appropriate
length
of
time
i
would
analogize
to
the
rule
in
tax
law,
which
in
that
case
is
the
taxable
year.
here
the
appropriate
length
of
time
to
avoid
any
claim
of
harassment
would
seem
to
be
the
time
within
which,
probably
a
year,
in
which
as
a
matter
of
random
selection
of
inspection
sites
this
plant
should
once
again
come
on
the
roll.
but
in
the
interim
this
plant
would
indeed
be
immune.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be
one
year,
but
it's
whatever
time
in
normal
course
this
plant
might
be
due
for
inspection
again.
as
it
happens,
there
are
no
set
rules
as
to
how
often
a
particular
plant
is
inspected.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
concededly,
to
hold
in
favor
of
the
stauffer
company
here
would
not
present
the
full
array
of
problems
that
would
be
involved
in
a
comparable
decision
in
the
previous
case,
because
the
government
would
remain
free
to
relitigate
this
issue
as
against
other
companies
in
other
circuits
and,
as
has
been
the
experience,
and
produce
a
conflict
which
ultimately
could
reach
this
court.
there
presently
is
such
a
conflict
between
the
bunker
hill
case
and
the
stauffer
case.
but
nevertheless,
the
consequences
of
holding
that
because
there
is
mutuality
here
there
is
an
estoppel
running
to
this
company
for
all
its
plants
nationwide
would
be
most
disturbing.
let
me
give
the
following
illustrations
of
the
consequences
of
holding
for
stauffer
according
to
its
argument
here.
let
us
suppose
that
bunker
hill,
the
company
whose
plant
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
found
to
be
subject
to
inspection
with
the
aid
of
independent
contractors,
had
a
plant
located
in
the
sixth
circuit.
now,
is
it
precluded,
because
it
lost
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
failed
to
apply
for
certiorari,
from
claiming
the
exemption
which
is
the
law
of
the
sixth
circuit
or
the
law
of
the
tenth
circuit
at
present?
and
if
not,
it's
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
which
seems
only
inappropriate
in
this
area
of
public
law.
the
same
problem
in
reverse
arises
if,
as
is
the
case,
stauffer
has
plants
in
the
ninth
circuit.
we're
told
it
has
eleven
plants
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
that
independent
contractors
may
enter
to
help
epa
personnel
conduct
the
inspection.
well,
must
the
ninth
circuit
ignore
its
own
rule
and
apply
estoppel
to
the
stauffer
plants,
uniquely
the
stauffer
plants?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i'm
not
so
sure,
justice
rehnquist.
suppose
this
case...
this
court,
in
this
case
or
in
another
case,
does
resolve
the
conflict.
does
that
wipe
away...
i
don't
think
my
opponent
concedes
that
it
does...
the
estoppel
effect
of
their
judgment
in
the
tenth
and
sixth
circuits?
they
would,
i
suppose,
maintain
that,
notwithstanding
that
the
law
had
been
authoritatively
declared
to
be
otherwise,
estoppel
still
protected
them
nationwide
because
the
government
had
lost
the
first
case
against
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is,
though
i'm
not
clear
that
that
rule
is
of
peculiar
relevance
in
the
situation
of
mutuality.
there
certainly
is
with
respect
to
non-parties.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
we
have
done.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly
so,
and
that
is
why
that
cannot
be
the
result.
we
have,
of
course,
litigated
with
another
company
and
won
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
bunker
hill
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
suppose
that
stauffer
would
still
maintain
that
in
the
sixth
and
tenth
circuit
it
was
immune
because--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--or
anywhere.
or
anywhere,
indeed,
because
this
hasn't
arisen
in
the
first
and
second
and
third
and
fifth
and
eighth
circuits.
in
those
circuits,
according
to
my
opponent,
the
courts
must
give
one
rule
to
bunker
hill
plants
and
another
rule
to
stauffer
plants,
and
with
respect
to
the
plants
of
third
companies
they
may
apply
either
rule.
now,
that
cannot
be
a
result
which
is
tolerable,
even
pending
the
resolution
of
the
matter
by
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
so,
but
to
require
or
to
anticipate
that
congress
will
resolve...
as
this
court
is
only
too
painfully
aware,
it
is
this
court
and
not
congress
that
most
habitually
resolves
these
kinds
of
problems.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
have
said
nothing
on
the
merits
and
wish
only
to...
i
must
rely
to
a
large
degree
on
our
briefs
for
that
point.
let
me
simply
quickly
outline
the
five
points
we
would
make
on
the
merits.
the
relevant
section
says
on
its
face
that
authorized
representatives
of
the
administrator
may
perform
these
inspections.
that
is
different
from
saying
officers
and
employees.
another
subsection
enacted
contemporaneously
of
the
same
section,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
itself,
quite
plainly
uses
the
words
"authorized
representative"
as
not
meaning
simply
officers
and
employees,
since
they
are
listed
and
the
listing
would
be
redundant.
the
legislative
history
supports
our
conclusion
because
we
have
a
house
version
far
more
restrictive
with
respect
to
inspections,
which
spoke
of
officers
and
employees
only
to
conduct
these
inspections,
the
senate
version
spoke
in
the
terms
of
the
ultimate
enactment,
and
it
is
clear
that
the
conference
preferred
the
senate
version
on
this
question
of
the
provisions
for
inspection.
there
was
presumably
a
point
to
that,
the
difference.
there's
nothing
unusual,
of
course,
about
securing
the
aid
of
independent
contractors
to
perform
like
inspections.
it
was
authorized
by
congress
most
recently
in
1980
with
respect
to
inspections
under
the
solid
waste
fuel
act.
and
finally,
there
has
been
a
consistent
agency
practice
since
1970
of
using
such
independent
contractors,
and
congress
when
it
revisited
the
law
in
1977
apparently
endorsed
that
preexisting
practice.
