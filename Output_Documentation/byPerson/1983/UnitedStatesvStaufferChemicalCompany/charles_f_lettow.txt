mr.
charles
f.
lettow
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
epa
in
this
particular
case
has
been
a
persistent
plaintiff,
at
least
as
far
as
stauffer
is
concerned.
as
mr.
claiborne
has
discussed
with
you,
the
successive
proceedings
in
stauffer
i
and
then
in
stauffer
ii
arise
on
virtually
indistinguishable
facts.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes.
the
only
differences
between
the
stauffer
i
case
and
this
case
are
that
the
contractors
in
both
cases
were
different
and
the
particular
location
of
the
plants
was
in
different
states.
otherwise,
the
cases
themselves
arise
on
identical
facts.
as
it
happened,
in
stauffer
i
epa
planned
to
use
a
private
contractor,
gca
corporation,
to
conduct
that
inspection
of
the
plant
in
wyoming.
it
followed
the
same
pattern
in
stauffer
i
that
mr.
claiborne
has
described
for
stauffer
ii.
epa,
accompanied
by
its
contractor,
approached
the
people
at
the
plant
in
order
to
carry
out
the
inspection.
stauffer
welcomed
the
inspection
by
epa
officials.
the
wyoming
state
officials
were
accompanying
epa.
epa's
intent
in
actually
inspecting
the
plant
was
to
audit
the
state
enforcement
efforts.
there
wasn't
anything
in
particular
directed
against
stauffer
in
this
particular
instance.
but
stauffer
would
not
willingly
allow
gca
corporation,
in
stauffer
i,
to
inspect
the
plant,
at
least
absent
a
written
trade
secret
agreement
or
an
agreement
to
protect
those
trade
secrets
that
were
in
use
at
the
plant
and
the
processes
that
were
employed
there.
when
epa
obtained
a
search
warrant,
it
did
so
ex
parte.
the
search
warrant
called
on
the
gca
men
to
make
the
inspection
accompanied
by
epa
officials.
when
they
came
to
the
plant
to
execute
the
warrant,
stauffer
again
said:
we
will
welcome
the
inspection
by
epa
and
wyoming
officials;
we
will
not
willingly
admit
the
gca
men,
again
absent
an
agreement
to
protect
trade
secrets.
and
at
that
point
epa
decided
not
to
make
the
inspection
using
its
own
people,
even
though
the
people
it
had
on
hand
were
qualified
to
make
that
inspection.
stauffer
moved
that
same
day
to
quash
the
warrant
in
wyoming
federal
district
court.
the
court
held
a
two-day
evidentiary
hearing
and
it
decided
two
things.
it
quashed
the
warrant
on
two
grounds:
first,
that
epa
was
not
entitled
to
rely
on
the
clean
air
act
as
a
basis
for
using
independent
contractors
to
make
that
search.
it
had
no
such
power
under
the
act.
and
then
secondly,
because
of
the
interchange
between
stauffer
and
epa,
epa
was
not
authorized
to
use
an
ex
parte
procedure
to
get
the
warrant.
at
that
point
stauffer
had
a
judgment
that
applied
to
that
plant
in
wyoming.
but
then,
about
six
weeks
after
the
wyoming
district
court
had
ruled,
epa
went
to
the
federal
magistrate
sitting
in
nashville
and
obtained
a
warrant
in
this
case,
stauffer
ii,
calling
for
a
different
contractor,
pedco
environmental,
inc.,
accompanied
by
epa
to
enter
the
stauffer
plant
at
mount
pleasant,
tennessee,
and
carry
out
an
inspection
there.
the
scenario,
as
mr.
claiborne
has
described
it,
in
stauffer
ii
is
a
replay
of
what
happened
in
stauffer
i.
the
sixth
circuit
concluded
that
epa
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
question
of
statutory
authority
to
use
contractors
to
make
searches
in
that
first
stauffer
case.
it
lost.
when
it
took
an
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling
against
epa.
under
this
court's
decision
five
terms
ago
in
montana,
that
was
enough
such
that
epa
should
be
collaterally
estopped
from
asserting
that
same
right...
that
is,
the
right
to
use
private
contractors
in
searches...
against
stauffer
in
any
other
plant
that
stauffer
has
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
it
would
last
forever,
but
it
would
last
as
long
as
the
circumstances
were
comparable,
and
i
think
that's
the
import
of
this
court's
rulings
in
moser
and
montana.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
i
think
both
under
the
ruling
in
moser,
which
has
already
been
discussed,
and
montana,
which
explained
moser,
we
would
not
be
able
any
longer
to
assert
collateral
estoppel
against
the
government.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
correct,
as
long
as
there
is
nothing
in
the
factual
circumstances
that
arise
in
the
successive
case
that
would
change
how
the
rule
of
law
arises.
is
it
the
same
question
of
law?
and
in
this
case
it's
clear,
i
think,
that
in
stauffer
ii
the
question
is
the
same
as
in
stauffer
i.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
we
would
agree.
and
in
fact,
that
also
is
the
position
the
restatement
takes
on
this
very
point.
we
would
concede
that.
but
that,
of
course,
hasn't
happened.
in
fact,
there
are
two
rulings
on
the
merits
by
court
of
appeals.
they're
both
in
stauffer's
favor.
they're
both
stauffer
cases.
there's
one
ruling
against
and
that's
the
bunker
hill
situation.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
in
that
particular
instance
i
don't
think
the
sixth
circuit
would
have
said
anything
at
all
about
the
merits.
i
think
it
would
have
stopped
with
the
collateral
estoppel
ground.
it
was
a
very
unusual
procedural
setting
in
the
sixth
circuit
that
led
to
the
dual
decision.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
again,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
done
that
in
this
case,
in
stauffer
ii.
i
think
what
you're
raising
as
a
hypothetical
might
be
what
might
happen
in
the
ninth
circuit
if
epa
were
to
try
to
use
a
contractor
to
inspect
a
plant
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
there
we
would
say
epa
is
collaterally
estopped
only
as
to
stauffer
because
of
the
prior
decision
in
the
wyoming
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
correct.
it
can
apply
it
against
anyone
else
at
least
once,
because
that's
the
opportunity
that
stauffer
had.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
but
if
you
decided--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
--i
agree.
if
you
decided
that
the
law
was
on
the
merits
as
epa
says
it
is,
then,
as
justice
white
posed
earlier,
we
would
not
any
longer
be
able
to
assert
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
even
in
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
it's
a
very
narrow
application
of
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
that's
a
prudential
rule.
i
think
the
sixth
circuit
was
right
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
power
to
reach
the
merits
if
it
wanted
to.
it
didn't
have
to.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall?
i
didn't
hear.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
that
is
entirely
up
to
you.
if
you
want--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
--also
to
go
on
to
the
merits--
[laughter]
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
justice
marshall,
just
as
in
the
sixth
circuit,
we're
not
in
a
position
to
say
you
should
or
should
not
reach
the
merits
in
this
case
if
you're
comfortable
ruling
for
stauffer
on
the
collateral
estoppel
issue.
that's
an
entirely
prudential
issue
that's
up
to
this
court
to
decide.
i
don't
think
it's
within
the
power
of
a
private
counsel
to
advise--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
--well,
it
does,
but
what
you're
saying
then
is
we
couldn't
estop
the
government.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes.
so
we
couldn't
in
any
other
case
either,
because
you've
changed
the
controlling
law.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
that's
the
issue
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
have
had
if
it
had
disagreed
with
us
on
the
merits.
but
i
don't
think
that's
presented
in
this
particular
case,
because
you
have
to
face
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
first
and
you
only
get
to
the
merits
if
you've
ruled
against
us
on
collateral
estoppel.
epa
suggests
fairly
straightforwardly
in
this
particular
case
that
it
wants
the
montana
precedent
limited
and
it
wants
it
limited
in
two
particular
respects.
its
first
claim
is
that
collateral
estoppel
shouldn't
be
applied
because
the
facts
in
the
two
cases,
stauffer
i
and
stauffer
ii,
aren't
identical
in
all
respects,
not
just
in
all
legally
significant
respects.
remember,
we
do
have
these
two
factual
differences
that
really
don't
have
any
bearing
on
the
applicability
of
the
legal
question
in
the
case.
and
there
epa
or
the
government
bases
its
argument
on
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
moser
and
the
exception
that
it
announced
there
for
a
principle
of
law
that
was
decided
arising
on
a
different
demand.
what
epa
is
saying
is
that
by
different
we
mean
in
any
respect
whatsoever,
not
just
legally
significant
differences.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
in
this
case,
in
montana
the
court
didn't
think
it
made
so
much
sense
that
the
government
was
right
in
arguing
for
complete
factual
stasis,
because
it
said
there:
no,
that's
not
really
what
we
mean;
what
we
mean
is
you
want
to
look
to
see
whether
the
question
of
law
is
in
substance
the
same
as
was
resolved
in
the
prior
litigation
against
the
united
states.
so
essentially,
in
montana
the
court
explained
moser,
and
perhaps
it
has
to
do
with
the
way
the
moser
case
is
reported,
because
if
justice
stevens
is
correct
then
moser
basically
held
that
anyway.
but
i
think
that
has
given
rise
to
some
confusion.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
well,
that's
true.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
question
of
law
is
really
the
turning
point
in
the
case.
you
can
have
a
lot
of
cases
that
turn
on
facts
or
factual
determinations.
that's
not
so
in
this
case.
the
government
is
just
asserting
flatly
that
it
has
a
right
to
bring
private
contractors
into
plants.
the
whole
focus
of
the
case
is
on
that
particular
instance.
it's
not
a
tort
case,
where
you
might
have
claims
of
negligence
that
turn
on
facts
or
that
sort
of
thing.
and
in
fact,
the
1982
restatement
of
judgments...
that's
the
restatement
of
judgments
second...
concurs
basically
with
this
court's
explanation
of
the
moser
case
in
montana,
because
the
restatement
takes
the
position
that
the
test
is
whether
the
facts
are
sufficiently
similar
or
identical
for
purposes
of
the
applicable
rule
of
law.
i
think
that
really
is
the
test.
and
indeed,
if
epa's
position
were
adopted
we'd
be
remitted
to
the
separable
facts
doctrine
that
this
court
announced
in
the
1948
tax
case
of
commissioner
versus
sunnen.
i
think
that
was
what
mr.
claiborne
was
referring
to
when
he
was
talking
about
the
irs
deficiencies
focusing
on
a
particular
tax
year
or
not.
but
this
court
there
had
announced
that
rule
in
a
tax
case.
even
commentators
or
subsequent
courts
had
great
difficulty
in
applying
it
even
in
the
tax
area,
let
alone
other
areas
of
law,
and
we
would
take
the
position
that
this
court
in
montana
limited
sunnen
to
accord
with
its
views
regarding
moser,
and
there's
no
reason
now
to
go
back
to
the
old
sunnen
test
and
to
apply
it
or
just
sort
of
resurrect
it
and
apply
it
not
just
in
tax
areas,
but
to
all
areas
of
law.
so
we
would
argue
that
the
montana
test
makes
sense,
it
ought
to
apply
to
this
case,
and
the
sixth
circuit
indeed
correctly
applied
it.
epa
has
a
second
suggestion,
though,
for
limiting
montana,
and
it's
equally
as
wide-ranging.
it
asks
the
court
to
adopt
an
exception
for
what
it
calls
"recurring
questions
of
law".
we
acknowledge
that
the
courts
traditionally
have
given
the
government
substantial
latitude
to
relitigate
legal
issues.
we
acknowledge
that
the
restatement
of
judgments
notes
that
the
government's
special
role
is
entitled
to
weight
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
apply
collateral
estoppel
in
the
particular
case.
we
question
whether
anybody
has
concluded
that
the
government's
role
is
dispositive,
and
it
would
have
to
be
dispositive
to
rule
against
us
on
collateral
estoppel
in
this
particular
case
because
this
is
the
most
traditional
application
of
collateral
estoppel.
this
is
defensive
collateral
estoppel
by
the
party
to
the
prior
case.
that
is,
mutuality
is
present.
stauffer
was
subject
to
repetitive
claims,
excessive
claims
by
epa,
not
the
other
way
around.
and
accordingly,
you
have
both
the
values
of
conservation
of
judicial
resources,
which
you
discussed
in
the
mendoza
argument,
and
the
protection
of
that
prevailing
party
against
the
vexation
and
expense
of
successive
litigation
that
come
to
bear.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
it's
a
different
claim
technically,
just
like--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
insofar
as
a
different
time,
a
different
warrant
was
actually
obtained
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
you
shouldn't
treat
this
as
res
judicata
any
more
than
you
treated
the
montana
case
as
res
judicata,
because
there
you
technically
had
in
the
second
claim
by
the
government
a
different
contract.
same
facts,
almost
identical
facts,
but
a
different
contract.
we're
in
the
same
position
that
the
state
of
montana
was
in
that
litigation.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
yes,
because
the
facts
are
so
close
that
you
have
precisely
the
same
issue
presented.
you
can
assure
yourselves
of
that
using
the
test
in
montana,
which
explained
moser
and
sunnen.
i
think
that's
a
fairly
clear
exposition
of
what
the
existing
law
is.
that's
all
we're
asking
be
applied.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
that's
correct,
it's
same
claim
preclusion--
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
--it's
not
same
issue
preclusion.
that's
what
collateral
estoppel
is.
defensive
use
of
collateral
estoppel
has
been
something
that
this
court
has
traditionally
favored,
as
indeed
all
courts
have.
back
to
the
1971
decision
in
the
patent
case,
blonder-tongue,
that
involved
application
of
defensive
use
of
collateral
estoppel
by
a
non-party.
but
the
court
there
noted
that
defensive
use
was
a
favored
application,
as
contrasted
to
offensive
use.
and
then
in
parklane
hosiery,
which
allowed
offensive
use
by
a
non-party,
the
court
also
observed,
though,
that
defensive
use
didn't
pose
the
same
problems
that
offensive
use
did.
and
this
case
illustrates
that,
especially
because
defensive
use
is
confined
only
to
the
prevailing
party
in
the
prior
case.
epa
was
preclude
from
bringing
its
claim
only
against
stauffer.
it
can
relitigate
it
against
anyone
else
at
least
once.
the
experience
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
in
deciding
cases
after
the
montana
and
parklane
case
is
we
think
instructive.
we
have
cited
a
series
of
those
cases
in
our
brief.
uniformly,
the
courts
have
applied
collateral
estoppel
where
you
had
successive
suits
by
the
government,
even
on
recurring
issues
of
law,
where
the
private
party,
the
prevailing
party
in
the
prior
case,
was
applying
collateral
estoppel
defensively.
we
have
cited
continental
can,
which
is
a
case
by
the
seventh
circuit
which
held
that
osha
couldn't
successively
sue
a
company
for
a
series
of
noise
violations
arising
at
different
plants
in
the
country,
and
it's
obviously
very
close
on
its
facts
to
this
case.
then
there
was
itt-rayonier
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
there
barred
successive
claims
by
government
agencies
against
a
company
alleging
violations
of
one
water
discharge
permit.
then
there
was
the
union
carbide
case
in
the
second
circuit.
there
the
irs
was
barred
from
asserting
a
deficiency
against
union
carbide
for
the
1971
tax
year
where
it
had
previously
litigated
and
lost
the
same
issue
against
the
company
regarding
the
1967
tax
year.
and
then
in
the
starker
case,
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well,
you
had
again
an
irs
tax
deficiency
assessed
against
a
father
where
the
irs
had
litigated
previously
against
the
son
on
transactions
arising
out
of
exactly
the
same
contract.
now,
based
on
this
experience
in
the
courts
of
appeals
since
you
decided
the
montana
and
parklane
hosiery
cases,
judge
jones,
who
wrote
separately
in
the
sixth
circuit,
thought
he
was
able
to
distill
a
consensus.
we
think
that
consensus
is
instructive.
what
he
said
was:
i
don't
favor
precluding
a
federal
agency's
ability
to
test
its
policy
decisions
in
more
than
a
single
circuit
in
circumstances.
but
while
he
didn't
do
that,
in
circumstances
where
the
same
defendant
is
sued
in
seriatim
without
the
agency
attempting
to
exhaust
its
appeals
on
the
previous
judgment,
the
equities
favor
application
of
collateral
estoppel
and
not
its
abdication.
and
you
also
have,
along
the
same
line,
an
expression
of
view
in
the
american
medical
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
which
both
the
government
and
we
have
argued
extensively,
which
said
that
there
aren't
any
national
shockwaves
that
are
going
to
be
generated
if
the
court
applies
collateral
estoppel
defensively
against
the
government
on
a
recurring
issue
of
law
only
against
the
party
that
prevailed
in
the
prior
litigation.
we
think
that
the
government's
special
role
might
be
enough
to
turn
aside
an
offensive
use
of
collateral
estoppel,
whether
it
be
by
a
party
or
a
non-party.
it
might
be
enough
to
turn
aside
defensive
use
of
collateral
estoppel
by
a
non-party.
but
we
don't
have
those
cases
here.
this
is
at
the
core
of
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
and
the
courts
that
have
denied,
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
denied,
use
of
collateral
estoppel
in
these
other
circumstances
have
uniformly
distinguished
this
case.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
only...
we
can
collaterally
estop
the
government
on
an
issue
of
law
arising
on
identical
facts
or
virtually
identical
facts.
that's
our
argument.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
but
it's
been
applied
by
this
court
for
almost
60
years.
you
can
go
back
to
the
moser
case
and
it
was
applied
there.
we
aren't
really
asking
for
anything
different
than
what
this
court
did
in
moser.
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
or
montana.
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
to
turn
briefly
to
the
search
warrant
question,
although
there
we
think
that
judge
weick's
opinion
in
the
sixth
circuit
fairly
and
adequately
covers
all
the
relevant
points.
he
concluded,
as
the
tenth
circuit...
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
his
opinion
for
himself
and
judge
siler,
as
the
tenth
circuit
had
earlier
in
stauffer
i,
that
private
contractors
were
not
to
carry
out
searches
at
private
plants
for
epa
under
the
clean
air
act,
that
epa
had
no
power
to
designate
them
to
do
that.
he
concluded
that
that
was
congress'
intent
when
it
adopted
the
statutory
provision
with
which
we
are
concerned,
and
he
concluded
also
that
it
was
important
to
note
that
in
centuries
of
anglo-american
jurisprudence
private
parties
had
never
been
allowed
to
carry
out
governmental
searches.
this
was
a
rare
exception.
it
was
almost
unprecedented,
and
that
had
a
role
to
play
in
how
one
should
look
at
the
particular
statutory
provision
that's
at
issue
here.
that
provision
is
section
114(a)(2)
of
the
clean
air
act.
as
mr.
claiborne
pointed
out,
it
was
adopted
by
congress,
it
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1970.
at
the
time
of
its
adoption,
the
house
had
provided
in
its
bill
that
officers
and
employees
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
which
was
then
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
administering
the
act,
could
enter
and
inspect
plants.
the
senate's
bill
had
provided
the
"authorized
representative"
language
which
now
appears
in
the
final
text.
in
the
conference
committee
report
which
describes
the
conferees'
effort
to
resolve
the
differences,
the
conferees
describe
the
house
provision
as
authorizing
dhew
investigatory
personnel
to
enter
and
make
searches
of
plants.
it
described
also
the
senate
provision,
the
dhew
personnel
to
enter
and
search
plants.
in
other
words,
it
used
exactly
the
same
language
to
describe
those
persons
who
could
implement
the
authority.
judge
weick
in
the
sixth
circuit,
like
the
tenth
circuit
had,
viewed
this
declaration
of
equivalence
between
the
terms
by
the
conferees
as
indicating
the
congressional
intent
not
to
ascribe
any
particular
difference
in
interpretation
or
construction
between
the
choice
of
the
two
terms.
and
indeed,
there
is
also
other
evidence
which
indicates
that
the
senate
did
not
have
in
mind
any
broader
reach
in
using
the
term
"authorized
representative"
than
the
house
did
when
it
used
the
term
"officers
and
employees".
the
senate
had
used
generally
the
term
1970.
there
was,
however,
a
section
of
the
senate
bill,
section
209(a),
at
least
it
was
then,
which
dealt
with
epa's
access
to
the
records
of
auto
manufacturers,
and
that
section
provided
specifically
that,
upon
request
of
an
authorized
representative
of
the
secretary,
again
of
hew
at
that
point,
the
auto
manufacturer
must
permit
such
officer
or
employee
to
have
access
to
the
records.
this
was
direct
evidence
of
what
the
senate
had
in
mind.
it
meant
officers
and
employees
when
it
used
the
term
"authorized
representatives"
in
the
statute.
and
indeed,
this
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
was
confirmed
very
shortly
thereafter.
after
the
congress
had
completed
work
on
amendments
to
the
clean
air
act
in
1970,
it
then
turned,
or
the
same
committees
turned,
the
clean
water
act,
and
they
proposed
to
add
terms
to
the
clean
water
act
which
would
authorize
the
agency
to
inspect
and
search
plants.
they
used
when
they
did
that
as
a
model
the
provisions
which
they
had
just
adopted
in
the
clean
air
act.
in
fact,
the
terms
in
the
water
act,
that
section
308(a),
are
almost
identical
with
those
which
appear
in
section
114(a)(2).
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
they
are
not
identical,
but
they
are
in
this
particular
respect.
and
at
the
time,
the
senate
report
of
the
water
act
provision
stated
that:
"it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
authority
to
enter,
as
under
the
clean
air
act,
is
reserved
to
the
administrator
and
his
authorized
representatives,
which
such
representatives
must
be
full-time
employees
of
the
environmental
protection
agency.
"
"the
authority
to
enter
is
not
extended
to
contractors
with
the
epa
in
pursuit
of
research
and
development.
"
mr.
charles
f.
lettow
no,
it's
not.
and
indeed,
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
both
observed
that
the
statement
by
the
later
congress
ordinarily
would
have
little
weight
regarding
what
an
earlier
congress
had
meant.
that's
quite
correct,
justice
blackmun.
but,
as
judge
weick
found
in
this
case,
you
have
the
situation
where
the
clean
water
act
provision
was
very
specifically
and
expressly
modeled
after
the
clean
air
act,
congress
in
fact
wanted
the
two
provisions
to
be
construed
in
para
materia,
one
with
the
other.
and
indeed,
the
statements
were
also
very
closely
contemporaneous
in
time.
the
one
followed
the
other
by
only
ten
months.
we
think
also,
in
addition
to
that,
the
statutory
context
also
supports
the
construction
that
the
sixth
circuit
adopted.
there
is
a
sister
provision
to
section
114(a)(2)
and
that
is
section
114(d).
section
114(d)
says
that
where
searches
by
epa
are
being
carried
out
at
plants
in
a
given
state,
the
agency
or
its
authorized
representatives
should
give
notice
to
the
affected
state
that
these
inspections
are
being
carried
out.
as
both
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
found,
it
almost
passes
understanding
that
the
congress
would
have
had
in
mind
in
adopting
that
provision
that
you'd
have
notice
given,
such
a
sensitive
intergovernmental
communication,
by
a
contractor
and
not
by
the
responsible
government
official.
what
epa
does
is
point
to
a
different
section,
that's
section
114(c),
as
support
for
its
position.
but
that
section
doesn't
even
relate
to
searches.
instead,
what
it
does
is
authorize
disclosure
of
confidential
information
to,
in
the
words
of
that
particular
section,
"authorized
representatives
of
the
united
states.
"
this
is
a
broader
reference.
what
it
does
in
effect
is
serve
a
completely
different
purpose.
it
allows
epa
to
pass
confidential
information
to
federal
and
state
agencies
who
are
responsible
for
carrying
out
the
clean
air
act
in
circumstances
where
they
otherwise
wouldn't
be
able
to
because
of
constraints
that
would
apply
in
the
trade
secrets
act
and
in
the
federal
reports
act.
and
as
a
consequence,
that
provision
was
needed
to
allow
that
exchange
of
information.
there
is
one
occasion
that
we're
aware
of
ever
when
congress
has
permitted
a
private
party
to
carry
out
searches,
and
that
sole
occasion
arises
in
the
1980
amendments
to
the
solid
waste
disposal
act.
it
allows
epa
to
designate
contractors
as
its
representatives
only
for
purposes
of
that
act.
it's
instructive
that
at
the
time
congress
did
that
it
also
imposed
criminal
sanctions
on
contractors
who
abused
that
authority.
those
criminal
sanctions
apply
where
a
contractor
gains
confidential
trade
secret
information
during
its
inspection
and
then
might
use
it
itself
or
otherwise
disclose
it.
what
that
criminal
provision
actually
does
is
apply
provisions
or
sanctions
to
that
contractor
that
are
equivalent
to
the
trade
secrets
act.
that
doesn't
happen
in
the
clean
air
act.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
that,
and
it
confirms
congress'
intent
that
it
didn't
want
private
contractors
carrying
out
searches.
we've
also
discussed
the
one
common
law
exception
in
our
briefs.
that
goes
back
to
the
1660's
and
the
reign
of
charles
the
ii,
and
indeed
writs
of
assistance.
and
i
will
leave
that
to
the
briefs,
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
indeed
writs
of
assistance
as
they
were
applied
in
the
american
colonies
were
one
of
the
causes
not
only
of
the
revolution,
but
also
led
directly
to
the
fourth
amendment,
and
it
indicates
that
there
is
still
a
reason
for
insisting
on
the
traditional
rule
that
government
searches
be
carried
out
only
by
government
people.
as
one
judge
put
it,
government
officials
have
the
normal
discipline
that's
applicable
to
public
officials,
and
certainly
a
private
contractor
doesn't
have
that
discipline.
thank
you.
