would
it
be
different,
mr.
claiborne,
if
only
one
plant
were
involved?
you
mentioned
the
number
of
plants
of
this
company.
would
that
plant
be
immune
from
subsequent
relitigation
of
the
same
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
it
was,
but
more
recently
you've
been
talking
about
multiple
plants.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
the
appropriate
time
be
one
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
very
different
from
the
preceding
one,
in
that
you
have
identical
parties
and
identical
issues,
don't
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
all
of
the
policy
arguments
that
the
government
makes
seem
to
me
to
be
considerably
stronger
in
the
earlier
case
than
they
do
here.
do
you
agree
to
that?
