justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
i
suppose
that
so
long
as
the
rule
were
limited
to
mutuality
that
eventually
this
court's
practice
of
granting
certiorari
when
a
conflict
emerges
would
make
the
kind
of
problems
you're
describing
fairly
short-lived.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
exception
to
collateral
estoppel
for
a
change
in
the
controlling
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lettow,
does
that
distinction
in
the
moser
case
about
a
question
of
law,
do
you
think
it
really
makes
a
great
deal
of
analytical
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
think
of
any
litigation
between
two
parties
that
wouldn't
give
rise
to
a
question
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
res
judicata
in
your
view
really
applies
only
to
what
you
might
call
an
effort
to
reopen
a
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
same
claim.
