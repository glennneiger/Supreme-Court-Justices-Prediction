well,
isn't
that
doctrine,
though,
served
by
saying
that
one
bite
at
the
apple
is
enough?
how
soon
does
it
become
too
repetitive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
that
case?
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
both...
in
the
prior
moser
litigation,
there
both
was
a
question
whether
he
was
entitled
to
this
installment
of
pension
based
on
the
higher
rate
because
his
service
at
annapolis
was
civil
war
service,
and
also
his
salary
during
his
world
war
one
service,
which
presented
a
different
claim
than
the
claim
to
a
pension.
and
both
of
those
were
held
to
be
governed
by
the
issue
preclusion.
now,
why
isn't
that
just
like--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
only
appears...
i
happen
to
have
a
very
diligent
law
clerk.
it
appears
in
the
court
of
appeals
report,
but
not
in
the
supreme
court
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
it's
really
a
matter
of
some
national
importance
i
suppose
congress
could
pass
a
clarifying
amendment
and
that
whole
problem
would
go
away,
because
after
a
congressional
change
there
would
surely
be
no
right
to
claim
a
vested
interest
in
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
happen
to
believe
that
need
not
always
be
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
had
thought
you
were
wrong
on
the
merits,
but
nevertheless
affirmed
on
estoppel
grounds,
so
that
we
wouldn't
really
be
changing
the
law
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
might
have
had
a
panel
decision
that
went
off
on
the
merits
and
then
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
decided
en
banc
that
estoppel
applies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let's
follow
up
on
your
ninth
circuit.
you're
right,
that
is
a
better
example.
but
there
would
be...
if
we
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits
and
you
lost
on
the
merits,
the
ninth
circuit's
controlling
law
would
not
be
changed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
nevertheless
agree
you
would
not
be
able
to
plead
collateral
estoppel?
