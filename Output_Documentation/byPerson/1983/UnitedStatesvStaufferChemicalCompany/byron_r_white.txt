justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
would
last
forever?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
what
about
the
circumstance,
what
if
in
litigating
with
other
parties
the
epa
established
the
controlling
law
in
this
court
that
was
contrary
to
the
decision
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
the
controlling
law
was
changed,
though,
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
during
that
time
you
should
be
entitled
to
your
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be
the
same
question
of
law,
but
if
the
controlling
law
has
changed
you
just
shouldn't
be
entitled
any
longer
to
rely
on
that
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
epa
is
not
entitled
to
try
to
change
the
controlling
law
by
litigating
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
really
say
it's
at
the
core
of
collateral
estoppel
if
you
concede
the
general
rule
that
you
aren't
collaterally
estopped
on
issues
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
very...
if
you're
going
to
have
to
go
through
that
routine,
it's
hardly
so
clear
that
it's,
say,
at
the
core
of
collateral
estoppel.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
montana,
you
say.
