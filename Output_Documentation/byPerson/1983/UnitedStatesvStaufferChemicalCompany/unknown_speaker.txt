unknown

could
you
have
gone
back
in
the
same
circuit?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
should
be
able
to
relitigate
with
stauffer
at
the
same
plant?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and
if
you
couldn't?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
couldn't,
you
couldn't
elsewhere,
either?
unknown
speaker
he
was
recalled
to
active
duty
in
world
war
one,
which
was
an
ironic
fact.
unknown
speaker
if
you
litigated
the
same
issue
with
another
company
and
won--
unknown
speaker
--that
employees,
non-employees
could
inspect,
if
there
were
collateral
estoppel
forever
stauffer
would
be
permanently
exempt
from
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
it
came
here
and
it
was
affirmed,
the
ninth
circuit
was
affirmed,
and
the
rule
was
then
established
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
or
anywhere.
unknown
speaker
even
in
the
ninth
circuit--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
there's
no
change
in
the
controlling
law?
unknown
speaker
even
with
respect
to
the
very
plant?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
want
to
help
us
a
little?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know.
but
if
we
go
on
to
the
merits
and
we
change
the
controlling
law,
your
estoppel
argument
goes
out
the
window.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
good
is
your
estoppel
argument
if
you
just
concede
a
court
may
nevertheless...
even
though
the
government
is
estopped,
it
really
isn't
estopped
if
you
can
go
over
and
reach
the
merits
in
litigating
with
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
suggest
that
this
is
res
judicata?
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
different
plant.
unknown
speaker
different
facts.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
really
here
arguing
that...
i
would
think
you're
really
saying
you
ought
to
treat
this
as
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
just
one
case,
one
situation,
as
you
have
already
said,
where
collateral
estoppel
should
apply
to
an
issue
of
law?
