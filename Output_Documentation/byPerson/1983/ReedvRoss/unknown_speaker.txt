unknown
speaker
could
i
interrupt
to
ask
you
a
question--
unknown
speaker
--about
the
case?
as
i
remember
the
cert
petition,
the
respondent
had
actually
been
released
from
custody.
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
also
true
that
the
period...
he
would
have
completely
served
his
sentence
now
if
he
hadn't
been
released
when
he
was?
he
was
on
parole,
i
think,
or
something
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
what
will
happen
if
you
win?
unknown
speaker
so
the
net
result
would
be
that
by
winning
and
lose,
if
you
win,
he
would
merely
have
postponed
what
would
otherwise
have
been
his
total
release.
unknown
speaker
there's
really
hardly
a
vital
state
interest
in
the
case
at
this
point.
i
guess
you
do
have
standing,
though,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
exactly
how
much
time
he'd
have
to
serve?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was...
what
was
the
court
doing
when
it
said
it
reviewed
the
instructions?
unknown
speaker
and...
but
you
think
that's
a
completely
different
thing
than...
than
forgiving
a
procedural
lapse?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if...
if
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
regularly
accepts
some
constitutional
challenge
to
a
set
of
instructions
even
though
those
challenges
weren't
presented
below,
there
wouldn't
be
any
lapse
at
all,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
but
they
will
always
review
it
for
plain
error?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it
might...
you
think
the
case
might
come
out
differently
if
he
had
raised
his
objection
below
and
preserved
it
and
presented
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
cause
in
prejudice
is
beside
the
point
if
there
hasn't
been
any
lapse.
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
how
you
think
the
interest
in
sandbagging
applies
here?
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
in
the
trial
context,
but
why...
why
if
the
lawyer
had
a
good
point...
and
presumably
he
has
here
if
it's...
if...
why
wouldn't
he
raise
it
on
direct
appeal
and
win
as
soon
as
he
could?
unknown
speaker
well,
he's
either
entitled
to
the
instruction
or
he
isn't.
i
mean
it's
as
simple...
this
one
is...
this
one
is
no
big
fact
problem,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
an
issue
like
this,
how
could
sandbagging
ever
occur
in
the
appellate
context,
unless
you
have
a
stupid
lawyer?
but
then
it's
not
sandbagging;
then
he's
stupid.
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
it
wouldn't
apply
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
in
that
respect
self-defense
and
malice
are
on
the
same
footing?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
have
we
held
that
the...
have
we...
is
there
a
decision
in
this
court
on
self-defense?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
haven't
held,
have
we,
on
a
decision
on
the
burden
on
self-defense,
did
we?
unknown
speaker
and--
--what
have
we...
what
have
we
held
on?
insanity
in
leland
against
oregon.
then
patterson
held
what?
what
was
it,
bryon?
do
you
know?
it's
malice,
isn't
it?
well,
it's
random
malice.
but
anyway,
the
malice
thing
is
clear
now.
but
the...
if
malice
is
an
element
of
defense...
of
the
offense,
the
prosecution
must
prove
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
clear.
unknown
speaker
that's
clear.
but
that
isn't
so
on
self-defense.
i
mean
we
haven't
covered
it.
unknown
speaker
but
a
lot
of
states
put
the
burden
on
the
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
any...
none
of
those
cases...
or
do
any
of
those
cases
rely
on
the
federal
constitution
for
that?
i
doubt
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
raising--
--that's
a
state,
sort
of
a
state
law.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you're
not
raising
that
question
here,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
you
think
of
anything
that
would
constitute
cause
for
failing
to
appeal
a
point
like
this?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
in
fact,
this
is
an
appellate
default
because
there's
no
trial
court
default.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
default.
unknown
speaker
then
it
wouldn't
be
a
default.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
a
case
where
there
would
be...
i
can
understand
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
of
course,
which
would
be
an
independent
reason
for
setting
aside
the
conviction.
but
if
you
don't
have
an
independent
ground
like
that,
i
suppose
you
could
never
have
cause.
unknown
speaker
i
think
they're
nonexistent.
unknown
speaker
then
there's
no
default,
by
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
but
then
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
record.
it
wouldn't
be
an
appellate
default
then.
that
could
only
be
raised
by
matter
de
hors
the
record.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
think
there
could
be
a
case
in
appellate--
unknown
speaker
--well,
other
than
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
even
on
a
total
failure
of
appeal
what
could
be
cause?
unknown
speaker
there
probably
couldn't
be,
could
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
didn't
appeal
it
because
there
was
a
decision
of
this
court
that
would
have
indicated
that
his
appeal
was
wholly
out
of
bounds?
unknown
speaker
and
then
later
this
court
reversed
itself.
unknown
speaker
well,
175
times.
unknown
speaker
so
even
then
you
would
say
there
would
not
be
cause
for
not
raising
it.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
have
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
can't
concede
in
a
federal
constitutional
issue,
can
it,
say
like
on
self-defense?
unknown
speaker
what
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
on
malice.
unknown
speaker
but
not
on
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
that's
enough.
but
so
you're
not
really
talking
about
self-defense.
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
didn't
pass
on
this
question,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--wouldn't
our
practice
indicate
that
if
we
were
to
resolve
against
you
the
questions
that
were
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit,
that
we
would
leave
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
district
court
or
some
other
court
than
this
one
this
inquiry
as
to
whether...
what
practice
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
followed?
surely
the
fourth
circuit
knows
more
about
north
carolina
practice
than
we
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
you
say...
you
say
with
respect
to
an
affirmative
defense.
now,
there
are
two
issues
in
your
case,
right?
one
is
self-defense,
which
this
court
simply
hasn't
yet
defined
whether
or
not...
what
line
that
side...
what
side
of
the
line
that
falls
in.
the
other
is
malice,
which
really
isn't
an
affirmative
defense,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the...
it
was
also
true
that...
that
malice
was
an
element
of
the
defense,
but
it
was
just
presumed.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
the...
nevertheless,
an
ingredient
of
the
offense
was
malice,
and
it
was
presumed.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the...
then
the
defendant
had
to
overcome
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
it
get
raised
in
winship
if
it
was
so
foreclosed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
in
logic?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
an
appellate
court
has
the
same
entitlement
to
be
put
straight
that
a
trial
court
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
do
you
really
think
it
makes...
it's
that
much
more
difficult?
if
you
listed
one,
two,
three,
down
to
thirteen
points
in
a
brief,
isn't
that
just
as
easy
as,
if
not
easier,
than
to
raise
it
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know,
but
the
point
was
saving
the...
saving
the
issue.
that's
what
your
focus
has
been.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
don't...
do
you
think
they
do
not
do
it
now
in
this
court
and
in
most
appellate
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
bother
the
system.
it
may
increase
the
printing
bill,
but
that's
about
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
only
thing
you're
really
talking
about
is
access
to
federal
habeas
corpus,
which
is
an
important
matter,
i
suppose.
you're
talking
about
having
access
to
that
system
15
years
after
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
well,
15
years
after
the
crime
is
committed.
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
crime
committed?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it's
16
years
after
the
crime
was
committed,
wasn't
it,
from
then
until
now?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
in
oregon
there
are
a
number
of
inmates
in
the
prisons
who
are
there
because
of
leland
against
oregon.
now,
suppose
this
court
were
to
say...
reverse
its
position
in
leland
against
oregon
and
say
no,
you
can't
put
any
burden.
as
you
know,
oregon
changed
the
statute
a
year
after
leland
against
oregon
and
made
it
just
a
preponderance
of
evidence.
but
would
you
say
that
every
one
of
those
prisoners
in
oregon,
whether
it's
15,
20
or
25
years,
should
have
relief
by
way
of
federal
habeas
corpus
because
of
a
change
in
the
rule?
