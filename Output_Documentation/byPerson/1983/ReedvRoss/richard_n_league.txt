mr.
richard
n.
league
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
presenting
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
cause
is
sufficient
grounds
to
excuse
the
procedural
default
in
the
context
of
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
our
position
is
that
in
this
particular
case
it
isn't.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
daniel
ross
in
1969
was
convicted
in
wake
county,
north
carolina
of
first
degree
murder
in
a
trial
that
he
put
on
evidence
of
self-defense
in.
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
gave
the
state
the
benefit
of
a
presumption
of
unlawfulness
and
malice
because
a
deadly
weapon
was
used,
and
also
put
the
burden
of
proof
in
one
of
two
contexts
on
mr.
ross
to
negate
self-defense.
mr.
ross
appealed
his
case.
he
did
not
assign
this
error,
the
instructions
in
this
regard,
and
that
is
where
we
urge
that
the
procedural
default
comes
in,
at
that
time
and
under
present
day
law
as
well,
although
it's
now
changed
in
terms
of
the
particular
statute.
north
carolina
required
an
issue
that
could
be
raised
on
appeal
to
be
so
raised.
it
could
not
be
raised
if
it
were
a
matter
of
record
on
post-conviction
review
after
the
appeal
under
ordinary
circumstances.
we
have
an
initial
problem
in
this
case
as
to
whether
we
do
have
a
forfeiture
because
of
some
language
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
on
the
matter,
and
i'll
address
that
first.
and
the
language
they
used
was
this:
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
properly
allocated
in
the
case.
that
was
used,
however,
not
in
the
context
of
an
issue
being
raised
about
this
matter,
but
it
was
made
as
a
part
of
a
discussion
that...
whether
or
not...
on
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
for
the
court
not
to
have
charged
on
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
there's
a
reference
in
the
instructions
on
down
the
line
that
the
court...
or
pardon
me...
in
the
opinion
on
down
the
line
that
the
court
was
waiving
its
rule
with
regard
to
assignments
of
error
to
parts
of
the
charge.
however,
this,
too,
was
made
in
the
context
of
referring
to
the
matter,
whether
or
not
the
instruction
on
involuntary
manslaughter
was
properly
not
given.
it
was
not
made
in
connection
with
the
reference
to
the
burden
of
proof
some
paragraph
and
a
half,
two
paragraphs
above
that.
on
thing
that's
occurred
to
me
with
regard
to
this
matter
that
might
provide
the
court
some
assistance
in
determining
whether
this
rather
cursory
reference
should
amount
to
a
waiver
of
the
state's
forfeiture
rule
is
something
that
comes
out
of
exhaustion
law.
and
when
an
issue
is
presented
in
a
state
court,
a
fact
situation
is
presented
in
a
state
court
on
the
basis
of
one
legal
theory,
that's
not
viewed
as
an
exhaustion
of
a...
of
a
separate
legal
theory.
therefore,
to
the
extent
this
court
may
feel
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
to
some
extent
waived
its
procedural
default
rule,
i
would
argue
that
the
most
they
were
looking
for...
and
it
was
on
their
own
initiative...
would
be
somewhat
of
a
plain
error
approach;
that
it
was
not
a
complete
waiver
of
the
state's
forfeiture
rule.
at
most
it
would
be
sort
of
a
pro
tanto
type
thing.
and
the
interest
in
comity
that
the
courts
recognized
underline
the
recognition
of
procedural
defaults
over
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
ought
to
apply
to
the
same
extent
that
the
state
court
recognized
and
followed
its
own
rule,
and
that
would
be
the
large
extent
in
this
case.
at
the
post-conviction
level
there's
an
additional
problem
as
well,
unfortunately,
and
that
stems
from
the
judge
at
the
superior
court
level
saying
in
rejecting
the
man's
post-conviction
proceeding
or
petition
that
no
grounds
for
relief
were
stated.
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
under
the
post-conviction
relief
act...
and
i
argue
to
you
that
that
certainly
is
most
likely
construed
as
a
procedural
waiver,
particularly
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
said...
after
recitation
of
the
man's
efforts,
including
his
appeal
and
his
lack
of
success
there.
there
wasn't
any...
any
reference
to
a
substance
obviation,
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong.
we've
suggested
to
the
court
in
our
brief
the
hayes
case
from
alabama,
u.s.
district
court
case,
provides
a
good
basis
for
approaching
this.
and
the
points
they
make
or
that
are
made
by
the
court
in
that
case...
the
fact
that
there's
a
well-established
body
of
procedural
default
rule
that
would...
procedural
default
law
that
would
apply
here;
and
the
fact
that
it
would
be
correctly
applied
here
as
shown
by
a
number
of
cases
we
cite
on
page
12
in
the
footnote
to
our
brief;
the
fact
that
the
state
pled
forfeiture,
as
it
did
at
its
first
opportunity...
that
would
be
at
the
appeal
level.
now,
in
state
post-conviction
proceedings
in
north
carolina,
often
an
answer
is
not
required
from
the
district
attorney's
office,
and
that
was
the
case
here.
the
adjudication
is
made
just
from
a
survey
of
the
writ
itself
or
the
petition
itself
initially.
it's
only
if
some
concern
is
raised
by
it
to
the
reviewing
court
that
they
will
go
ahead
and
call
for
an
answer
from
the
state.
the
other
consideration
noted
in
the
hayes
case...
that
the
decision
on
this
basis
would
favor
the
interest
in
avoiding
constitutional
questions...
would
also
apply
here
as
well.
north
carolina
has
such
a
preference
of
avoiding
such
questions
if
they
can.
mr.
nakell
has
argued
to
you
throughout
his
brief
that
the
perhaps
the
state
ground
relied
on
was
inadequate
here
because
of
certain
cases
and
the
resolution
of
them.
he
cites
a
hankerson
case
and
a
hancock
case
as
examples
where
mullaney-type
issues
were
allowed
to
be
raised
on
direct
appeal
despite
the
fact
that
no
assignment
of
error
was
made
with
regard
to
them.
that
is
true,
but
nevertheless,
the
case
was
still
on
direct
appeal,
and
therefore,
the
state
supreme
court
had
the
opportunity
to
correct
any
error
at
the
point
in
the
proceedings
that
they
wanted
to
do
so,
that
it
was
most
efficient
to
do
so
and
that
they
felt
it
was
proper
to
do
so.
it's
not
an
after-the-fact
thing
such
as
this
man's
case
is.
there's
reference
to
the
case
wynn
v.
mahoney,
but
the
conduct
there--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
he
was
close
to
parole.
he
was
in
a
limited
custody
type
of
status
allowing
him
substantial
home
leaves
and
work
release,
perhaps
study
release.
i'm
not
sure.
one
of
the
two.
he
is
not
completely
discharged.
he
had
not
been
completely
discharged
from
his
sentence,
nor
was
he
by
the
fact
that
we
did
release
him.
that
was
pursuant
to...
to
the
court
order.
mr.
richard
n.
league
if
i
win,
he
will
return
to
custody.
the
time
he
has
been
out
will
not
be
credited.
he
will
pick
up
most
likely,
one
would
hope,
within
several
weeks
of
readmission,
be
back
into
that
minimum
custody
status,
and
the
expectations
would
be
that
parole
would
be
shortly
granted.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
i
presented
my
views
on
that
in
the
cert
petition
and
hoped
they
had
been
accepted.
the
interest
would
be
not
so
much
in
mr.
ross'
case
but
in
the
other
applications
we
might
have
stemming
from
a
definitive
decision
by
this
court,
a
win
here,
and
in
having
the
fourth
circuit
overturned.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
don't.
the
wynn
case,
which
mr.
nakell
relied
on,
dealt
with
my
conduct
and
not
pleading
forfeiture
in
a
particular
case
rather
than
the
state
supreme
court's
reaction
to
such
an
issue.
and
i
don't
think
i
have
the
power
to
make
an
otherwise
adequate
state
rule
inadequate.
there
are
two
new...
new
developments
in
the
law:
the
recent
case
of
state
v.
bush,
interpreting
our...
or
brought
under
our
later
post-conviction
statute,
the
one
that
superseded
the
former
one,
i
believe
in
1978.
in
that
case
the
state
supreme
court
did
review
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
order
to
propound
the
law
they
did.
they
did
not
rely
on
procedural
default
in
that
case.
what
kind
of
harbinger
for
the
future
i
can't
say
to
you.
if
it
continues,
of
course,
and
it's
repeated,
you
would
not
find
the
state
ground
i'm
relying
on
adequate
on
down
the
line.
however,
mr.
ross
would
probably
get
the
benefit
of
any
change
in
that
regard.
15a-1419,
a
new
post-conviction
relief
statute,
now
called
motion
for
appropriate
relief
in
our
jurisdiction,
references
retroactive
decisions
as
a
basis
for
reopening
a
prior
post-conviction
proceeding.
however,
that's
only
in
the
instance
that
the
issue
is
ruled
on
on
the
merits
in
the
prior
proceeding.
it's
not
a
situation
such
as
i
have
argued
to
you
that
we
have
here;
that
is,
where
a
decision
was
made
on
procedural
grounds.
mr.
nakell
filed
a
number
of
cases
last
week
with
you-all
in
support
of
this
position,
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
consider
there
that
what
the
supreme
court
was
doing
was
waiving
its
procedural
defaults
again
in
the
direct
appeal
context
where
the
court
had
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
issues
presented
at
that
time,
and
not
waiving
them
in
a
post-conviction
context.
additionally,
the
rules
involved
there
are
rules
that
are
somewhat
dissimilar,
not
applicable
to
this
fact
situation
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
one
dealt
with
the
assignments
of
error
being
properly
constructed
primarily
or
referenced
in
the
brief
or
having
the
exceptions
set
out
with
regard
to
them.
again,
that's
not
a
situation
that
we're
concerned
with
here,
because
the
issue
again
was
not
presented
in
petitioners'
case
on
direct
as
it
was
in
each
of
these.
similarly,
it's
not
a...
there's
no
request
by
the
lawyer
after
giving
up
all
its
assignments
at
error,
asking
the
court
to
conduct
such
of
a
plain
error
review.
i
would
say
in
most
of
the
other
cases
mr.
nakell--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--your
honor,
i
assume
that
it
was
reviewing
those
instructions
on
its
own
to
see
if
there
was
any
plain
error
at
that
time
under
state
law.
that's
my
assumption.
mr.
richard
n.
league
you
mean
in
the
cases
mr.
nakell
cited,
the
later
cases,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--your
honor,
they
don't
do
that.
they
don't
accept
regular
constitutional
or
certain
constitutional
challenges--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--apparently
on
request,
at
least
in
these
cases...
and
i
believe
there
were
five
of
them
that
fit
that
mold...
the
lawyer
says
i
cannot
find
anything
wrong
with
this...
with
this
appeal;
i
am
abandoning
my
assignment
of
error;
would
you
please
look
it
over?
and
they
have
done
so.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
raise
it
below
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
would
have
since
1981
if
it
had
been
tried
then.
i
don't
think
the
case
would
come
out
differently
or
should
come
out
differently
in
this
court,
your
honor.
going
back
to
my
argument
a
little
bit
earlier
about
if
the
waiver
was
only
to
a
certain
degree
by
the
state
supreme
court...
that
is,
dealing
with
plain
error,
presumably
under
state
law...
then
certainly
i
would
argue
to
you
that
the
interest
in
comity
dictates
that
the
federal
courts
go
no
further.
mr.
richard
n.
league
oh,
i
understand.
yes,
sir.
it
assumes
that
we've
got
a
forfeiture
in
the
first
place.
going
on
to
the
next
hurdle
we
must
get
over,
and
that's
whether
wainwright
v.
sykes
applies
in
the
appellate
context
at
all.
since
that
dealt
with
trial
at
faults,
i
certainly
urge
you
to
go
ahead
and
adopt
that
course,
if
you
would.
the
majority
of
the
circuits
have
done
that.
the
interests
that
wainwright
v.
sykes
serves,
of
course,
are
not
quite
as
strong
in
the
appellate
context
as
they
are
in
the
trial
context,
because
you
don't
avoid
retrial.
that's
not
to
say
they're
not
without
strength,
though.
i
would
certainly
argue
to
you
that
they
are,
as
much
as
you
want
to
make
the
trial
the
decisive
and
portentous
event
with
regard
to
the
criminal
procedure.
with
regard
to
things
that
you
can
talk
about
there,
certainly
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
to
make
the
appeal
the
decisive
and
portentous
event
with
regard
to
matters
of
record
that
you
can
go
ahead
and
correct
there.
the
interests
in
finality
and
accuracy
are
similarly
enhanced
because
of
the
difference
in
timeliness
you
have
on
appeal
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
you
have
with
regard
to
post-conviction
or
collateral
attack.
in
this
particular
case
i
believe
the
appeal
was
resolved
some
eight
months
after
the
trial,
whereas
the
post-conviction
proceedings,
as
you
know,
are
now
in
their
twelfth
year.
even
mr.
nakell's
suggestion
were
adopted
by
you-all
that
we
should
have
laid
down
and
given
him
a
new
trial
in
'77
when
he
first
came
down
the
pike,
we'd
still
be
talking
about
eight
years,
so
there's
a
substantial
difference.
it
brings
to
mind
mr.
justice
harlan's
concerns
in
the
mackey
case
about
ultimately
the
retrial
being
as
unreliable
as
the
original
trial
was.
the
interests
in
sandbagging
i
think
hold
true
again.
i'd
argue
to
the
court
that
you
don't
have
to
overrule
fay
v.
noia
to
permit
this
in
this
case,
because
that
was
a
case
where
the
court
viewed
that
mr.
noia
had
been
prevented
wrongly
by
various
circumstances--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--okay.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
your
honor,
i
think
where
it
would
come
into
play
would
be
where
there'd
be
a
factual
dispute
about
it
and
the
lawyer
would
say--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--oh,
i
don't
say
sandbagging
occurred
here.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
don't
say
sandbagging
occurred
here.
i
don't
believe
he
withheld
it
intentionally
in
the
sense
of
saying
aha,
i
know
this
will--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--sandbagging,
i
would
say,
comes
into
play,
your
honor,
when
you're
dealing
with
factual
problems.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
no.
not
on
this
particular
case.
i
agree
with
that.
no,
sir.
going
on
to
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
cause
is
shown
by
novelty...
novelty
is
sort
of
a
shorthand
way
of
referencing
requiring
extraordinary
vision
on
the
part
of
the
defense
lawyers,
and
perhaps
it
convey
more
than
it
ought
to
in
view
of
its...
the
word
that
should
be
used...
that
is,
requiring
extraordinary
vision.
certainly
from
the
court's
decision
in
in
re
winship,
outlining
all
the
cases
from
the
federal
judiciary
that
indicated
that
burden
of
proof
was
a
matter
of
due
process
over
the
years,
that
fact
in
conjunction
with
the
wholesale
application
of
federal
constitution...
or
federal
trial
rights
to
the
state
criminal
proceeding
in
the
'60s
indicates
to
me
that
you
would
not
be
requiring
of
a
lawyer
extraordinary
vision
to
make
the
argument.
mr.
richard
n.
league
as
far
as
going
ahead
and
making
the
argument,
your
honor,
because
you're
dealing
with
argument
by
analogy,
by
and
large.
to
some
extent
they
both
interact
with
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
north
carolina,
because
north
carolina
offenses
always
have
proceeded
as
a
first
element
of
definition
as
unlawful.
self-defense
comes
in
there.
the
presumption
is
that
the
state
got
the
benefit
coming
in
with
the
element
of
malice.
i'd
say--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--not
to
my
knowledge,
no,
sir.
i
attempted
to
get
the
wynn
case
brought
up
here
on
that
basis,
but
cert
was
denied.
mr.
richard
n.
league
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
richard
n.
league
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
putting
on
the
burden
of
proof?
well,
in
the
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit's
decision...
and
wynn
was
a
habeas
case...
so
that
was
based
on
the
overview
of
federal
law
that
the
fourth
circuit
adopted.
they
went
the
other
way
in
virginia,
on
a
virginia
case
because
virginia
doesn't
use
unlawfulness
as
an
error.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
hankerson
held
substantially
the
same
way,
that
the
state
ought
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
self-defense
by
virtue
of
the
reference
to
unlawfulness
as
an
element.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
that's
their
interpretation
of
mullaney.
i
differed
with
it
and
argued
against
it
in
wynn,
but
i
didn't
convince
anybody.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
and
the
isaac,
of
course,
referenced
three
cases
that
were
decided
before
mr.
ross'
trial
and
the
year
before,
and
that
would
tend
to
indicate,
too,
what
we're
talking
about
or--
mr.
richard
n.
league
--thank
you,
your
honor.
