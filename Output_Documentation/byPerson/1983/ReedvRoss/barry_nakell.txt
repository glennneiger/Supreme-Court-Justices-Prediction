mr.
barry
nakell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
daniel
ross
was
convicted
at
a
constitutionally
unreliable
trial.
the
state
has
conceded
that
he
suffered
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
constitutional
violation
at
his
trial.
it
is
the
essence
of
fundamental
fairness--
mr.
barry
nakell
--your
honor,
the
state
has
conceded
that
he
suffered
prejudice
from
the
constitutional
violation.
certainly
it's
clear
from--
mr.
barry
nakell
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
they
would
refer
to.
certainly
it's
clear
that
mullaney
directly
applies
here.
mr.
barry
nakell
on
the
malice
issue,
yes.
and
that
would
be
enough.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
that's
enough,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
the
self-defense
question
is
open,
i
believe,
your
honor.
in
engle--
mr.
barry
nakell
--in
engle
the
court
said
that
it
wasn't...
that
it
had...
at
least
had...
was
not
without
merit.
and
i
think
that
engle
is
different
from
this
case
in
at
least
three
respects.
first,
as
justice
stevens'
questions
have
pointed
out,
the
procedural
failure
in
this
case
involved
a
failure
on
appeal,
and
not
a
failure
at
trial.
secondly,
the
north
carolina
courts
are
lenient
in
their
treatment
of
procedural
failures
on
appeal,
regularly
suspending
their
rules
and
overlooking
the
default
in
order
to
reach
the
merits,
as
they
did
in
ross'
case
both
on
appeal
and
on
his
post-conviction
petition,
and
as
they
did
in
several
other
cases
raising
the
same
mullaney
issue.
mr.
barry
nakell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
considered
the
argument
and
held
that
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
had
not
in
fact
reviewed
the
issue,
quoting
only
one
part
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
addressing
this
point.
the
north
carolina...
the
fourth
circuit
then
said
that
the
argument
is
not
without
force,
but
did
not
reach
the
issue;
and
so
there
is
no
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
on
this
issue,
that's
correct.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
list
of
cases
that
i
submitted
belatedly,
which
i
would
like
to
rely
on...
these
are
later
cases
in
which
the
north
carolina
courts
have
relied
on
a
new
rule
explicitly
giving
the
court
the
authority
that
it
already
had
to
suspend
the
rules...
in
many
of
those
cases
when
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
court
of
appeals
did
suspend
the
rules,
they
explained
that
they
were
doing
so
in
the
criminal
context
because
of
the
severity
of
the
offense
and
the
severity
of
the
punishment.
and
in
all
of
those
cases
the
offense
was
murder,
and
the
punishment
was
life
imprisonment.
mr.
barry
nakell
exactly
the
same
as
mr.
ross'
case.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor,
i
would
not
doubt
that
that
is
one
option
available
to
the
court,
and
i
would
certainly
think
that
it's
a
mandatory
option
if
the
court
were
to
rule
against
me
on
the
other
issues,
which
i
hope
it
would
not
do.
the
court
would
either
have
to
decide
the
issue
or
remand
it
to
the
fourth
circuit
where
it
would
still
be
open.
incidentally,
for
reasons
i
don't
know,
the
fourth
circuit
did
not
address
the
argument
that
the
north
carolina
courts
had
overlooked
this
failure
in
these
other
series
of
cases.
and
i
might
say
in
that
respect
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
before
this
court
in
the
identical
posture
of
hankerson.
if
there
is
any
difference,
it's
more
favorable
to
this
case.
but
in
hankerson,
hankerson
did
not
raise
the
mullaney
issue
on
appeal,
did
not
raise
it
in
the
record
on
appeal
as
was
required.
indeed,
it
wasn't
until
sometime
after
this
court
decided
mullaney
that
hankerson
moved
to
reopen
his
appeal
and
add
an
issue.
that
is...
that...
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do
that
because
his
case
was
still
pending
at
the
time
that
this
court
decided
mullaney.
but
his...
in
that
case,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
then
overlooked
the
procedural
failure,
granted
the
motion
and
reached
the
issue.
exactly
the
same
was
true
in
daniel
ross'
case.
the
only
difference
is
that
in
daniel
ross'
case,
mullaney
hadn't
been
decided,
indeed
winship
hadn't
been
decided,
and
certainly
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
did
not
address
those
points.
and
i
think
that
that
difference
does
not
matter
because
the
argument
is...
the
point
is
not
whether
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
considered
the
precise
argument,
but
whether
it
insisted
on
a
forfeiture
to
enforce
its
procedural
rule.
and
since
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
excused
the
failure
to
raise
the
issue,
that's
all
that
need
concern
the
federal
courts.
if
the
state
courts
do
not
insist
on
enforcement
of
their
procedural
rules
by
a
forfeiture,
then
the
federal
courts
show
no
disrespect
for
the
state
court
procedures
by
continuing
to
consider
the
issue.
the
third
respect
in
which
the
present
case
differs
from
engle
against
isaac
is
that
for
daniel
ross
at
the
time
of
his
appeal,
the
mullaney
issue
was
not
yet
reasonably
available.
the
foundation
principle
had
not
yet
been
decided,
and
no
counsel
or
court,
certainly
not
in
north
carolina,
and
indeed,
no
place
in
the
country,
had
perceived
or
begun
to
litigate
the
issue.
as
this
court
said...
expressed
the
test
in
footnote
41
of
engle,
the
issue
was
not
yet
a
live
issue
at
the
time
of
mr.
ross'
trial
and
appeal.
accordingly,
it
was
reasonable
for
ross
and
his
attorney
to
fail
to
raise
it;
or
as
north
carolina
stated
the
position
in
its
brief
in
this
court
in
hankerson,
ross
"quite
properly
took
no
exception
thereto.
"
the
state
relies
on
the
guilty
plea
cases
in
its
brief...
mcmahan
against
richardson
and
pollad
against
henderson...
and
that
line
of
cases
is
entirely
inapposite.
ross
did
not
plead
guilty.
ross
did
not
give
up
any
of
his
defenses.
he
did
not
give
up
any
of
his
rights...
present,
prospective
or
potential...
either
absolutely
or
in
exchange
for
any
benefit
or
leniency.
he
insisted
on
his
innocence,
and
he
pursued
respectively
all
of
the
state
procedures
as
best
he
could
at
the
time.
he
went
to
trial,
he
appealed,
and
when
later
this
court
decided
mullaney
and
then
decided
that
it
applied
to
his
trial
in
hankerson,
he
didn't
run
to
the
federal
courts
right
away.
instead,
he
filed
a
post-conviction
petition
in
the...
in
the
state
courts,
although
without
benefit
of
counsel.
and
only
after
he
was
unsuccessful
there
did
he
seek
relief
by
way
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
so
his
only
failure
was
the
failure
to
raise
the
issue
on
appeal.
and
why
didn't
he
raise
the
issue?
only
because
under
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time,
it
was
essentially
unavailable
to
him
because
his
attorney
did
not,
quoting
engle,
1952;
that
is,
to
raise
an
issue
challenging
the
placing
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
defendant
with
regard
to
an
affirmative
defense.
what
was
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
mr.
ross--
mr.
barry
nakell
--your
honor,
under
the
law
of
north
carolina
at
the
time,
and
indeed,
the
law
of
north
carolina
as
it
had
prevailed
for
over
a
century
since
1864,
for
105
years
at
the
time,
the
north
carolina
courts
had
declared
this
to
be
an
affirmative
defense;
that
is,
a
matter
of
excuse
or
extenuation.
and
on
the
basis
of
that
distinction
had
imposed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant.
so
that
under
north
carolina
law
it
was
treated
and
regarded
as
an
affirmative
defense,
both
issues.
both
were
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
under
north
carolina
law,
and
both...
just
coincidentally,
i
noted
in
leland
against
oregon
the
insanity
defense
in
oregon,
the
burden
of
proof
was
put
on
the
defendant
in
that...
in
that
regard
beginning
in
1864.
it
was
in
exactly
the
same
year
that
north
carolina
expressly
declared
this
law,
and
it
was
always
based
on
that
distinction
between
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
affirmative
defenses.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor,
the--
mr.
barry
nakell
--the
north
carolina
courts
indulged
in
two
rationales
in
order
to...
in
order
to
impose
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant.
sometimes
they
talked
only
about
the
presumption,
but
they
always
talked
in
terms
of
either
affirmative
defenses
or
matters
of
excuse--
mr.
barry
nakell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
nakell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
in...
in
patterson
against
new
york
in
1977,
in
summing
up
in
reviewing
the
course
of
the
law
earlier,
this
court
did
say,
as
the
solicitor
general
represented,
that
it
had
long
been
assumed
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
constitutionally
required
to
be
put
on
the
prosecution.
but
in
patterson
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
it
had
been
"the
long
accepted
rule
that
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
to
provide
that
various
defenses
were
to
be
proved
by
the
defendant.
"
the
court
recognized
in
patterson
that
that
had
been
the
long
accepted
rule,
notwithstanding
the
general
assumption
that
the
burden
of
proof
generally
had
to
be
put
on
the
prosecution.
and
that
long
accepted
rule
with
regard
to
affirmative
defenses
was
certainly
supported,
or
the
court's
statement
about
it,
in
patterson,
was
certainly
supported
by
the
decision
in
leland
against
oregon
back
in
1952
in
which
this
court
upheld
placing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
with
regard
to
the
insanity
defense...
not
only
the
burden
of
proof
and
not
only
beyond
a
preponderance...
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
indeed,
the
burden
of
proof
in
leland
against
oregon
on
the
defendant
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
court
upheld
that.
the
court
rejected
the
line
of
cases,
including
todd
against
united
states,
dealing
with
presumptions
and
the
constitutionality
of
presumptions
that
could
have
been
raised,
and
said
they
had
no
bearing
at
all
in
this
respect.
no
wonder
leland
against
oregon
seemed
to
settle
the
law,
and
after
leland
against
oregon,
nobody
started
to
raise
the
issue
again
until
after
winship.
indeed,
the
only
cases
raising--
mr.
barry
nakell
--well,
winship
was
an
unusual
case,
your
honor,
in
which
the
trial
judge
in
a
juvenile
proceeding
said
that
he
would...
he
found
the
defendant
guilty
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
not
if
the
test
were
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
issue
then
came
up
in
that
pure
form.
now,
at
that
time
there
had
been
the
decisions
that
the
court
discussed
in
its
footnote
39
in
engle,
the
decisions
in
stump
against
bennett
primarily,
and
also
state
against
nales.
both
of
these
decisions
involved
the
question
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
elements
of
the
offense,
not
affirmative
defenses.
and
indeed,
stump,
in
stump,
the
eighth
circuit
distinguished
leland
against
oregon
expressly
on
that
basis;
that
an
affirmative
defense
was
not
involved
in
that
case.
but
even
as
to
this
issue,
even
as
to
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
elements
of
the
offense,
that
same
case,
stump,
came
before
this
court
five
years
earlier
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
this
court
denied
that
petition
in
1963,
even
with
regard
to
an
element
of
the
offense.
and,
of
course,
that
has
no
precedential
effect,
but
it
wasn't
until
1968
that
the
courts
were
even
considering
the
issue
of
the
burden
of
proof
being
placed
on
the
defendant
with
regard
to
the
elements
of
the
offense,
the
basic
elements;
and
that
was
just
shortly
before
ross'
trial.
and
winship
was
decided
after
ross'
trial,
and
it
was
after
winship
that
all
the
activity
started.
and
not
even
right
away
then.
it
took
a
little
while
after
winship
for
attorneys
to
start
thinking
about
the
impact
of
that
on
affirmative
defenses.
and
the
activity
got
underway
at
that
time,
but
not
until
after
winship.
no
place
in
the
country,
no
attorney,
no
court,
and
certainly
not
in
north
carolina,
and
certainly
not
the
north
carolina
courts
considered
the
impact
of
winship
on
the
burden
of
proof
for
affirmative
defenses.
indeed,
even
just
before
and
just
after
ross'
trial
and
appeal,
and
even
a
couple
of
years
later,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
was
still
routinely
reiterating
the
general
burden
of
proof
rule
with
regard
to
affirmative
defenses,
these
two
affirmative
defenses;
and
that
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
defendant,
without
any
consideration
that
there
was
even
a
constitutional
question
about
it.
mullaney
was
not
decided
until
five
years
later,
and
in
mullaney,
in
patterson
against
new
york,
in
jackson
against
virginia,
and
in
ivan
v.
against
new
york,
this
court
said
in
all
of
those
cases
that
it
all
began
with
winship.
engle,
of
course,
involved
trials
that
occurred...
two
were
just
before
mullaney,
but
while
mullaney
was
pending
in
this
court,
and
one
occurred
after
the
mullaney
decision.
at
that
time,
as
the
court
noted,
dozens
of
lawyers
had
begun
to
raise
the
issue
as
to
affirmative
defenses,
including
the
affirmative
defense
of
self-defense.
there
were
law
review
comments
that
said
that
mullaney
had
an
impact
on
this
issue,
and
indeed,
even
the
state
law
had
been
changed
to
impose
the
burden
of
proof
in
that
way.
that's
a
very
different
situation
than
prevailed
in
1969
at
the
time
of
ross'
appeal,
and
certainly
a
very
different
situation
than
that
which
prevailed
in
north
carolina.
indeed,
the...
the
solicitor
general...
excuse
me...
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
in
his
brief
in
this
court
in
the
hankerson
case
advised
this
court
that
there
was
no
reason
for
anybody
to
anticipate
that
there
was
any
constitutional
problem
with
the
putting
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
as
to
affirmative
defenses
until
after
mullaney.
and
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
its
opinion
in
hankerson
said
that
it
was
only
mullaney
that
cast
any
question
on
the
state's
rule.
so
that's
why
ross
and
his
attorney
did
not
even
consider
raising
the
issue.
there
was
no
strategy
decision
involved,
no
tactical
decision.
this
was
an
understandable
and
excusable
failure
to
anticipate
the
new
development.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that...
that
even
this
circumstance
may
not
constitute
cause
under
the
wainwright
cause
and
prejudice
test.
but
that
can't
be
the
case,
especially
when
the
failure
arises
under
the
circumstances
here...
on
appeal
rather
than
at
trial,
regarding
a
rule
that
the
state
courts
regularly
decline
to
enforce
with
a
forfeiture,
and
concerning
an
issue
that
affects
the
reliability
of
the
verdict.
the
solicitor
general
cites
absolutely
no
authority
in
support
of
that
proposition,
and
all
the
authority
is
unanimously
to
the
contrary,
including
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
engle
the
court
suggested
that
the
unavailability
of
an
issue
might
constitute
cause.
certainly
in
o'connor
against
ohio
the
court
held
precisely
to
that
effect
in
1966.
o'connor
did
not
arise
under
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard,
but
it
certainly
showed
this
court's
opinion
with
regard
to
the
issues
of
fairness
involved
in
allowing
a
defendant
the
benefit
of
a
retroactively
applicable
rule
that
he
failed
to
raise
only
because
it
had
not
yet
been
decided
and
was
not
yet
reasonably
available.
there
are
many
other
cases
to
this
effect
from
this
court
which
are
cited
on
page
17
of
my
brief,
including,
i
think,
fay
against
noia,
which
demonstrates
the
way
that
this
court
approached
that
issue.
fay
against
noia
was
really
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
declined
to
appeal
because
of
the
failure
of
his
counsel
to
be
able
to
anticipate
the
later
decisions
of
this
court.
he
said
that
he
didn't
appeal
because
he
didn't
want
to
put
his
family
to
the
expense.
and
later,
at
about
the
same
time
as
it
decided
fay
against
noia,
this
court
held
in
douglas
against
california
that
because
he
was
indigent,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
have
the
defense
provided
by
the...
on
appeal
as
well
as
at
trial
by
the
state.
his
attorney
testified
that
he
was
afraid
of
getting
the
death
penalty
on
retrial.
years
later,
this
court
held
in
north
carolina
against
pearce
that
he
essentially
could
not
have
been
given
an
increased
sentence
on
retrial
unless
there
were
some
justification
for
it
in
terms
of
his
conduct
since
the
original
trial.
so
fay
against
noia
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
recognized
the
fairness
principle
involved
here.
all
other
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
held
that
this
is
a
paradigm
example
of
cause,
including
the
norris
case
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
the
solicitor
general
cited
with
special
approval.
all
the
law
reviews,
the
analogy
to
federal
rule
9,
9a
and
9b,
in
which
the
unavailability
of
a
decision
that
is
later
announced
is
established
as
cause.
and
finally,
the
legislation
that
the
reagan
administration
has
proposed
and
which
passed
the
senate
on
february
6th
of
this
year
is
directly
contrary
to
the
position
the
solicitor
general
has
taken
in
this
case
and
directly
supportive
of
ross'
position.
this
case
involves
no
failure
at
trial,
but
only
a
failure
on
appeal.
and
this
court
in
wainwright
against
sykes
expressly
recognized
the
difference.
indeed,
wainwright
against
sykes
was
based
on
the
difference.
the
court
in
davis
against
united
states
when
it
began
to
develop
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
specifically
distinguished
a
failure
to
raise
an
issue
at
trial
from
a
failure
to
raise
an
issue
on
appeal.
and
in
footnote
8
in
hankerson,
the
dictum
that
suggested
that
the
states
could
enforce
an
ordinary
rule
that
failure
to
object
to
a
jury
instruction
is
a
waiver
certainly
refers
to
a
trial
failure.
objecting
to
an
instruction
is
language
appropriate
to
the
trial
context.
and,
indeed,
north
carolina
read
it
that
way
in
its
answer
in
this
case.
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
raising
an
issue
on
appeal--
mr.
barry
nakell
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all--
mr.
barry
nakell
--your
honor,
there
certainly
are
some
policies
supporting
a
rule
requiring
an
issue
to
be
raised
on
appeal,
and
comity
considerations
suggest
that
a
federal
court
should
treat
respectfully
state
rules
in
that
regard,
requiring
issues
to
be
raised
on
appeal.
my
point
is
simply
that
those...
that
that's
the
only
policy
that
supports
it,
and
all
of
the
other
policy
reasons
that
the
court
relied
on
in
wainwright
against
sykes
with
regard
to
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule
at
trial
just
don't
apply
on
appeal.
moreover,
there
are
good
reasons
for
not
requiring...
not
requiring
defendants
to
raise
an
issue
on
appeal
in
order
to
have
it
available
on
federal
habeas
corpus,
at
least
where
the
issue
has
not
yet
been
decided.
and
the
most
obvious
is
the
one
that
the
court
alluded
to
in
engle,
and
the
institutional
reason
that
attorneys,
if
we...
if
the
court
does
apply
wainwright
against
sykes
to
appeals
and
not
excuse
the
failure
where
the
issue
is
unavailable,
attorneys
will
feel
obligated
on
every
appeal
to
raise
every
conceivable
issue,
even
those
that
seem
settled,
as
in
1969
as
a
result
of
leland
against
oregon,
this
issue
seemed
settled.
and
in
jones
against
barnes
this
court
counseled
against
that
kind
of
advocacy
on
appeal
and
recognized
the
importance
of
the
attorney
being
selective
in
the
issues
that
are
presented
on
appeal.
certainly
i
agree
with
that.
and
i
think
that
if
wainwright
against
sykes
is
applied,
the
cause
and
prejudice
test
is
applied
to
appeal,
and
there's
no
leeway
for
issues
that
are
unavailable,
attorneys
will
have
to
raise
every
issue.
for
example,
in
every
jurisdiction
that
doesn't
have
a
grand
jury
procedure,
or
in
every
jurisdiction
that
has
such
a
procedure
but
has
the
preliminary
hearing
as
an
alternative,
i
think
every
defendant
who
appeals
will
have
to
argue
from
now
on
that
the
fifth
amendment
requirement
of
indictment
by
grand
jury
applies
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause.
in
1884
this
court
seemed
to
settle
that
issue
in
ertado
against
california,
but
the
fact
that
it's
been
settled
would
not
be
a
justification
for
a
defendant
to
raise
the
issue
if
the
court
rules
the
way
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested.
so
that
that's
one
issue,
and
i
think
that
we
could
easily
think
of
about
200
issues
that
would
be
part
of
boilerplate
in
every
appeal
just
to
make
sure
it's
not
waived.
what
policy
is
served
by
requiring
a
procedure
like
that?
if,
indeed...
if
ross'
attorney
had
been
thinking
about
this
issue
in
1969
and
had
tried
to
raise
it,
he
could
not
have
done
so
in
much
other
than
boilerplate
fashion.
he
could
just
have
said
the
instruction
violates
due
process.
he
couldn't
have
cited
winship.
it
wasn't
available.
he
couldn't
have
cited
mullaney.
it
was
years
in
the
offing.
and
he
would
have
had
leland
against
oregon
to
contend
with.
so
that
there
would
be,
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
there
would
be
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
attorneys
to
raise
all
of
these
issues
no
matter
how
settled
they
appear
to
be.
and
that's
one
reason
i
think
that
the
issue
of
an
appeal
is
different
from
a
trial.
it's
easier
to
raise
these
issues
at
trial
than
it
is
to
clutter
an
appeal
with
raising
all
of
these
issues.
trials
are
accustomed
and
in
part
designed
to
receive
a
large
number
of
defenses,
to
receive
a
large
number
of
issues
of
varying
degrees
of
import.
mr.
barry
nakell
yes,
your
honor.
and
if...
is
that
all
that
we're
talking
about
here,
that
daniel
ross'
attorney
should
have
listed
it?
and
what
kind
of
consideration
would
he
have
got
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
if
he
had
done
that?
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor,
if
that
is
going
to
be
the
rule,
then
attorneys
will
do
that,
and
attorneys
will
have
boilerplate
briefs
that
they
file
in
every
case.
mr.
barry
nakell
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
too
much
of
it
now.
mr.
barry
nakell
but
i
think
that
this
will
require
it
to
be
done
in
all
cases.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
would
be
achieved
by
requiring
it.
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
it's
clear
that
had
ross
and
his
attorney
done
that,
it
would
have
accomplished
nothing.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
would
not
have
given
the
issue
much
consideration.
even
after
winship
when
the
issue
was
raised
in
sparks
and
wetmore,
the
court
said
winship
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this;
we
reject
it.
it
was
not
given
serious
consideration.
mr.
barry
nakell
what
we're
talking
about
is
getting
relief
from
an
unconstitutional
conviction,
no
matter
how
long
after--
mr.
barry
nakell
--well,
your
honor,
not
entirely
15
years.
mr.
ross
filed
his
post-conviction
petition
years
ago.
mr.
barry
nakell
your
honor,
the
crime
was
committed
in
1968.
mr.
barry
nakell
until
now,
yes,
your
honor.
but
that's...
that's
certainly
not
mr.
ross'
responsibility.
he
would
have
been
much
happier
to
have
the
issue
cited
much
earlier.
indeed,
he
would
have
been
happier
to
have
the
instructions
constitutional
at
his
trial.
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
pointed
out,
mr.
ross
served
almost
all
of
his
time
and...
or
he
had
a
life
sentence,
but
he
was
on
the
verge
of
being
paroled
at
the
time
of
the
fourth
circuit
decision,
and
so
the
state,
very
properly
i
think,
acquiesced
in
the
order
for
his
release.
but
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
this
done
much
sooner.
the
delay
worked
to
his
detriment,
not
to
the
state's.
he's
been
in
prison
all
this
time.
he's
served
15
years
as
a
result
of
an
unconstitutional
conviction.
mr.
barry
nakell
good
question,
your
honor.
let
me
respond
to
that
with
two
points,
if
i
might.
the
first
is
that
in
determining
the
retroactivity
of
an
issue,
the
first
question
that
the
court
focuses
on
is
whether
the
issue
is
one
that
goes
to
the
fairness
of
the
factfinding
process.
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
new
rule
should
apply
retroactively...
and
i
note
that
the
court
has
decided
exactly
the
contrary
in
leland,
approved
in
patterson
against
new
york...
that
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
that
was
such
an
unconstitutional
rule
that
affected
the
fairness
of
the
factfinding
process,
i
would
think
so.
with
regard
to
the
number
of
cases,
let
me
point
out
that
the
rule
that
i'm
requesting
in
this
case,
that
ross
is
requesting,
would
not
really
affect
many
cases.
first
of
all--
mr.
barry
nakell
--thank
you,
your
honor.
