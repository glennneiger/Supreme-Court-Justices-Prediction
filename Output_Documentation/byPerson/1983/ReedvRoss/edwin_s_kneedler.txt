mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
pick
up
on
the
novelty
question
that
was
just
beginning
to
be
addressed
here.
in
the
court's
decision
in
hankerson
applying
the
mullaney
decision
retroactively,
the
court
noted
that
in
many
cases
the
defendants
might
well
not
have
raised
the
particular
objection
involved
there,
and
that
the
courts...
or
that
the
states
may
well
be
able
to
protect
those
convictions
from
collateral
attack
or
other
attack
by
enforcing
what
the
court
referred
to
as
the
normal
and
valid
rule
under
which
a
claim
is
foregone
if
there
is
not
an
objection,
contemporaneous
objection
to
the
rule.
and
in
engle
v.
isaac
the
court
addressed
an
aspect
of
that
question.
there
had
been
no
objection
raised
to
the
instruction
in
engle
v.
isaac.
this
was
prior
to
the
hankerson
decision.
and
a
claim
was
made
that
under
prevailing
law
at
the
time
it
would
have
been
futile
to
raise
such
an
objection,
and
the
court
emphatically
rejected
that
suggestion
that
futility,
perceived
futility
in
the
state
court
was...
would
be
an
adequate
ground
or
cause
for
forgiving
the
procedural
default
in
the
state
court.
and
the
court
also
noted
that
the
allegation
that
the
claim
was
novel
was
not
sufficient
in
that
particular
case
because
the
defendants
there
had
been
tried
after
this
court's
decision
in
re
winship,
which
held
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
criminal
cases.
the
effect
of
the
court's
ruling
there
was
to
limit
or
to
prohibit,
in
effect,
the
retroactive
application
of
mullaney
to
the
most
recent
cases
to
that
decision,
those
in
the
later
years;
but
it
reserved
the
question
of
whether
a
claim
that
was
truly
novel,
one
that
would
have
required
extraordinary
vision,
would
constitute
cause
for
excusing
the
procedural
default.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
that
position,
it
would
have
the
ironic
effect
not
of
preserving
convictions
that
were
most
recent
at
a
time
when
the
rule
itself
was
being
questioned
and
yet
setting
aside
convictions
that
were
the
oldest
at
a
time
when,
by
hypothesis,
the
right
was
not
recognized
and
that
the
trial
procedure
was
uniformly
recognized
as
being
fair.
the
court
recognized
in
engle
v.
issac
that
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
set
aside
a
conviction
where
there
is
fundamentally
unfair
incarceration.
and
we
would
submit
that
if
in
engle
v.
isaac
where
the
issue
is
beginning
to
be
litigated
there
was
not
fundamentally
unfair
incarceration,
then
it
follows
a
fortiori
here
that
there
was
not,
if
the
suggestion
is
that
the
claim
is
not
novel.
but,
in
fact,
the
claim
could
hardly
be
described
as
novel
in
the
years
prior
to
in
re
winship.
in
in
re
winship
itself,
the
issue
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
not
the
rule
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
criminal
prosecution:
the
rule
was
simply...
the
question
was
simply
whether
that
rule
should
apply
in
juvenile
proceedings.
and
this
court's...
this
court's
decision
in
patterson
stated
that
long
before
in
re
winship,
the
universal
rule
in
this
country
was
that
the
prosecution
bears
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
fact,
in
1968
before
this
court's
decision
in
winship
and
before
the
respondent's
trial
in
this
case,
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
johnson
v.
bennett
and
heard
argument
on
the
question
of
whether
imposing
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
for
an
alibi
defense
violated
due
process.
and
the
court
remanded
for
further
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
an
en
banc
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
also
before
respondent's
trial
in
this
case,
that
struck
down
a
similar
instruction
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
the
eighth
circuit
had
regarded
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
corresponding
rule
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
be
so
well
established
that
there
was
no
real
question
of
retroactivity
in
that
case
at
all.
and
finally,
there
were
a
substantial
body
of
state
law
at
the
time,
as
mr.
justice
white
identified,
under
which
the
burden
of
proof
on
malice
and
self-defense
was
on
the
prosecution
rather
than
on
the
defendant.
while
those
cases
do
not
arise
under
the
due
process
clause,
they
do
recognize
a
recognition
of
the
burden
of
proof
issue
as
being
an
aspect
of
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
indeed,
that's
the
rationale
in
the
decisions
for
imposing
the
burden
on
the
defense
in
those
cases.
so,
in
fact,
at
the
time
of
respondent's
trial,
and
as
the
court
said
in
patterson
long
before
that,
the
notion
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
was
a
fundamental
aspect
of
due
process.
now,
even
if
the
court...
even
if
the
right
here,
though,
could
be
recognized
or
thought
to
be
truly
novel,
as
i
said,
we
submit
that
that
would
not
be
cause
for
excusing
the
procedural
default.
now,
first
of
all,
in
this
case
there's
no
indication
that
in
fact
that
was
the
reason
why
no
objection
was
lodged.
there
was
also
no
indication
to
that
effect
in
engle
itself.
now,
if
the
attorney
had
focused
on
the
question
of
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
due
process
clause
and
decided
not
to
raise
it,
because,
by
hypothesis,
no
one
had
recognized
a
due
process
violation
here,
then
the
lawyer's
judgment
in
that
regard
could
not
be
questioned
under
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
rationale;
and,
in
fact,
respondent
doesn't
suggest
as
much.
so
that
if
the
lawyer
had
actually
focused
on
it,
it
would
have
been
a
tactical
judgment
that
this
is
one
of
the
objections
that's
not
worth
making
in
a
trial
that
requires
many
objections.
that
would
be
a
tactical
judgment
which
respondent
concedes
would
not
constitute
cause
for
excusing
the
procedural
default.
so
respondent
then
is
reduced
to
arguing
with
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
didn't
think
of
it.
even
though
if
he
had
thought
of
it,
it
wouldn't
have
been
cause,
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
didn't
think
of
it
must
constitute
cause
because
the
right
was
novel.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
failing
to
appeal
it?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i
would
think
if...
in
far
different
circumstances
if
the
failure
to
include
it
in
the
arguments
on
appeal
amounted
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
a
basis.
or
if
there
was
a
state
procedural
rule
that
barred
the
raising
of
such
a
claim
on
appeal,
that
would
be...
that
would
be
cause.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
must
then--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right.
it's
another--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
would
think
that
the...
i
would
think
that
the
situations
would
be
rare.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ordinarily...
ordinarily...
ordinarily
cause
would
be
where
the
state
has
done
something
to
prevent
the...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
through...
through
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
or...
or
one...
one
other
circumstance
where
it
might
be
as
if
the
factual
basis
for
the
claim
was
not
known
at
the
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
ordinarily
that's
true,
yes.
so
in
the...
in
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
the
appellate
process,
that's
true.
now,
there
may
be
a
situation
involving
a
total
failure
to
appeal
as
distinguished
from
the
failure
to
raise
an
argument
on
appeal
where
the
circumstances
of
fay
v.
noia,
which
the
court
left
those
particular
circumstances--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
a
total
failure
to
appeal,
depending
on
the...
if
the
defendant
was
not
informed
of
his
right
to
appeal
in
some
fashion,
that...
that...
either
by
the
lawyer
or
by
the
court
or
was
unaware
of
it,
in
those
circumstances
that
might
be
true.
but
where...
where
you're
including
an
argument
on
appeal,
as
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
jones
v.
barnes,
the
lawyer
has
to
make
difficult
judgments
as
to
what
arguments
to
raise
on
appeal
and
what
arguments
not
to
raise
on
appeal
once
the
defendant
has
made
the
fundamental
right
to
go
ahead.
so
if
by
hypothesis
this
right
was
so
novel
that
no
one
was
litigating
it
at
the
time,
then
the
lawyer
could
hardly
be
faulted
for
not
including
the
right
on
appeal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
only
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
occasionally
this
court
has
reversed
itself,
and
it's
done
so
presumably
in
cases--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
cases
in
which
litigants
have
chosen
to
reopen
the
issue
even
though
it
appeared
to
be
foreclosed
by
this
court.
and
it...
even
though--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
because
the
cause
in
prejudice--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
now,
of
course,
this
is
not...
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
was
a
change
in
the
law
in
that
sense,
where
a
prior
decision
was
overruled.
and
so
even...
even
if
that
was
thought
to
be
a
separate
category
of
cases,
that's
not
this
case,
because
here
the
principals
involved
here
are
an
elaboration
of
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
both
with
respect
to
self-defense
and
with
respect
to
malice.
because
in
this
particular
case,
under
north
carolina
law
those
are
deemed
to
go
to
elements
of
the
offense
rather
than
to
be,
strictly
speaking,
affirmative
defenses.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
the
difficulty
of
the
inquiry
into
whether
a
right
is
truly
novel
or
not.
as
the
debate
in
the
brief
suggests,
it
can
require
an
exhaustive
review
of
state
law,
federal
law,
law
review
articles,
this
court's
decisions...
all
to
the
point
of
seeing
when
the
first
time
a
particular
right
was
identified
as
being
raised.
thank
you.
