ms.
lois
dejulio
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
in
the
factual
setting
of
the
public
school
system,
but
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
let
the
context
obscure
the
fact
that
the
issues
presented
here
are
not
ones
of
educational
policy,
but
are
rather
ones
of
criminal
law.
the
question
is
not
whether
or
under
what
circumstances
schools
may
regulate
the
conduct
of
their
students.
it
is
not
whether
this
school
may
use
certain
types
of
evidence
in
its
own
internal
disciplinary
proceedings
to
form
the
basis
for
imposing
school
sanctions.
rather,
the
question
is
whether
a
court
of
law
may
permit
an
individual
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
based
upon
evidence
illegally
seized
from
him
by
a
government
official.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
your
honor--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--your
honor,
the
fourth
amendment
has
never
been
applied
to
actions
by
purely
private
citizens,
and
certainly
a
parent
would
be
acting
in
a
purely
private
capacity.
however,
courts
have
distinguished
between
the
teacher
acting
as
a
state
official
and
the
parent
acting
in
a
parental
role.
at
one
time,
courts
held
that
the
teacher
acted
in
loco
parentis,
that
is
to
say,
instead
of
the
parent,
and
that
doctrine
may
well
have
accorded
with
facts
of
the
educational
system
as
it
stood
200
years
ago,
when
the
parent
would
hire
a
tutor
or
select
a
private
school
that
would
carry
out
the
parents'
own
educational
philosophy
and
disciplinary
standards.
but
in
today's
modern
compulsory
system
of
education,
the
teacher
serves
a
very
different
role.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
would
submit,
yes,
that
that
might
very
well
be
perfectly
proper
under
the
constitution,
and
if
the
parent
gave
the
evidence
to
the
police,
that
may
well
also
be
proper.
ms.
lois
dejulio
that
may
very
well
be
a
perfectly
proper
course
of
events.
in
this
case,
it
did
not
occur
in
that
way,
and
the
issue
of
whether
the
juvenile
herself
consented
to
the
search
by
the
principal
under
new
jersey
law
was
decided
against
the
state
because
it
was
not
shown
that
she
was
aware
she
had
a
right
to
refuse,
which
would
be
the
test
under
new
jersey
state
law
for
a
consent
search.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
think
that
conduct
would
most
likely
be
permissible.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
the
test
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
set
forth
did
not
prevent
teachers
or
educators
from
conducting
searches.
it
merely
required
that
they
have
some
reasonable
basis
to
do
so.
ms.
lois
dejulio
with
regard
to
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
we
would
submit
that
if
an
improper
search
were
conducted
by
a
governmental
employee,
and
i
would--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--well,
if
that
were
found
to
be
correct,
if
there
were
probable
cause,
then
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
permissible
search.
however,
if
not,
it
might
be
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply
in
that
circumstance,
depending
on
whether
the
actions
of
the
nurse
were
considered--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--if
the
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
don't
know,
because
i
am
not
aware
of
the
circumstances
in
state
hospitals,
whether
the
actions
of
a
state
hospital
employee
would
constitute
governmental
action
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
could
certainly
see
some
very
definite
similarities,
and
i
would,
without
knowing
more,
conclude
that
that
may
be
the
case.
ms.
lois
dejulio
in
that
circumstance,
it
may
very
well.
again,
the
circumstances
that
i
am
not
aware
of
might
lead
a
court
to
conclude
that
it
would
not
be
state
action,
but
with
regard
to
schools
and
educational
officials,
the
vast
majority
of
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
which
have
considered
the
question
have
found
that
school
authorities,
at
least
in
our
modern
system
of
compulsory
education--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--no,
your
honor.
with
the--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--well,
the
standard
that
the
new
jersey
court
set
forth
was
a
reasonable
ground
standard,
which,
by
reading
the
context
of
the
decision
they
viewed
to
be
a
significantly
less
stringent
standard
than
probable
cause.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
certainly
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
did
not
think
so.
ms.
lois
dejulio
we
argued
below
that
the
standard
of
probable
cause
should
be
applied.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
your
honor,
that
issue
was
not
before
the
court
because
the--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--well,
certainly
when
the
search
at
issue
is
a
personal
search,
and
by
that
i
mean
a
search
of
a--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--of
a
purse,
of
a
pocket.
i
would
submit,
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
did
indicate
that
its
own
standard,
as
the
search
became
more
intrusive,
the
level
of
reasonableness
would
closely
approach
probable
cause,
that
certainly
that--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--well,
the
requirement
of
a
warrant
presents
certain
difficulties
for
the
school
authorities.
ms.
lois
dejulio
that
has
been
the
prevailing
decisions
by
most
courts
which
have
considered
it.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
would
certainly
be
comfortable
with
a
probable
cause
standard
even
in
the
absence
of
a
warrant.
ms.
lois
dejulio
but
i
think
that
the
circumstances
may
well
devolve
into
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
in
most
cases
because
of
the
nature
of
the
school
environment.
the
ability
of
the
administrator--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
dejulio
and
i
think
that
is
why
the
new
jersey
court
and
many
other
state
courts
found
that
the
warrant
requirement
would
be
particularly
difficult
for
schools
to
comply
with
because,
as
my
adversary
noted,
schools
are
not
primarily
involved
in
investigating
criminal
conduct.
ms.
lois
dejulio
it
would
be
difficult.
they
would
have
to
go--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--it
might
present
very
difficult
procedural
problems.
ms.
lois
dejulio
no,
your
honor.
in
our
position
before
the
new
jersey
state
supreme
court,
we
argued
that
probable
cause
should
be
the
required
test
when
a
full
search
was
being
conducted.
we
obviously
distinguish
between
the
less
intrusive
search,
such
as
the
frisk
for
a
weapon,
which
might
arise
in
the
school
setting
because
obviously
the
police
would
only
have
to
meet
a
reasonable
suspicion
test
in
that
circumstance,
and
we
conceded
that
if
a
school
authority
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
student
was
armed
and
dangerous,
that
the
lesser
standard
would
be
justified
in
that
circumstance
as
well.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
certainly
in
a
weapons
situation
if
we
hold
the
police
to
that
standard
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
we
should
not
allow
educators
to
act
in
that
circumstance
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
reasonable
grounds,
but
again,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
determined
that
the
reasonable
grounds
was
the
standard
that
they
would
adopt
for
all
school
searches,
regardless
of
the
purpose
or
the
nature
of
the
substance
being
searched
for,
with
the
caveat
that
as
the
search
became
more
intrusive,
the
reasonable
grounds
would
more
closely
approach
probable
cause.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
it
is
not
before
this
court
as
i
understand
it
because
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
found
the
search
of
the
juvenile
to
be
unreasonable.
therefore
we
were
not
in
a
position
to
petition,
and
the
state
did
not
take
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
with
the
nature
of
the
standard
which
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
adopted.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
think
the
facts
of
the
case
do
support
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
search
at
the
outset.
moreover,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
made
the
further
finding
that
even
if
the
initial
opening
of
the
purse
had
been
reasonable,
the
scope
of
the
search
enlarged
far
beyond
the
reasonableness
that
would
have
justified
the
opening
of
the
purse.
the
principal
testified
that
he
opened
the
purse
looking
for
tobacco
cigarettes,
and
that
he
saw
a
package
of
marlboro
cigarettes
sitting
right
on
top.
at
that
point,
he
had
done
all
that
one
could
argue
would
be
reasonable
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
but
he
then
proceeded
to
remove
the
cigarettes,
observe
the
rolling
papers,
which
he
then
felt
gave
him
a
basis
to
go
further,
to
open
up
zippered
compartments,
to
read
personal
papers
which
the
student
had.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
a
close
case,
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
in
this
school,
unlike
many
others,
smoking
was
not
per
se
forbidden.
the
school
permitted
students
to
smoke
in
certain
designated
areas,
so
that
many
students
would
be
lawfully
carrying
cigarettes
in
their
purses
or
pockets.
so
that
the
search
for
cigarettes
really
was
not
proof
positive
either
that
the
juvenile
had
been
smoking
in
the
girls'
room,
which
was
not
a
specially
designated
area.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
i
think
it
may
have
been
some
evidence,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
conclusive
in
that
the
fact
that
she
was
carrying
cigarettes
did
not
prove
that
she
herself
smoked.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
as
i
would
be
happy
to
concede,
i
think
that
it
is
a
close
case,
and
that
the
facts
would
support,
however,
the
conclusion
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
made.
ms.
lois
dejulio
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
ms.
lois
dejulio
yes,
your
honor,
and
certainly
the
state--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--and
we
would
submit
that
that...
the
past
decisions
of
this
court,
without
exception,
when
the
state
is
attempting
to
utilize
the
fruits
of
its
illegal
conduct
on
its
direct
case
in
chief
in
a
criminal
matter,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
must
be
applied.
while,
as
my
adversary
notes,
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
constitutionally
mandated
in
every
circumstance
where
fourth
amendment
violation
occurs,
those
cases
have
not
in
any
way
affected
the
core
deterrent
function
of
the
rule,
which
is
to
prevent
the
government
from
profiting
from
the
fruits
of
its
own
illegal
conduct,
to
impose
a
criminal
sanction
upon
the
victim
of
the
search.
this
case
arises
from
a
criminal
prosecution
in
which
the
state
was
attempting
to
use
the
evidence
to
prove
guilt
the
result
of
which
would
be
the
imposition
of
the
criminal
sanction
upon
the
victim
of
the
search.
ms.
lois
dejulio
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
is
the
government's
action
in
opening
the
purse,
and
that
in
that
capacity
the
teacher
acted
as
the
government.
ms.
lois
dejulio
it
would
be
perfectly
valid
if
the
school
teacher
had
some
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
student
was
violating
a
school
regulation
or--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
concede
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
student
had
violated
a
school
rule.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
she
was
observed
by
a
teacher
smoking
in
a
restricted
area,
an
area
where
it
was
not
permissible
to
be
smoking,
but
that
fact
would
be,
i
think,
analogous
to
a
situation
where
a
teacher
may
have
found
two
students
fighting
in
a
hallway.
certainly
that
is
a
breach
of
school
rules
as
well
as
a
criminal
violation.
ms.
lois
dejulio
whether
the
evidence
that
was
found--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--i
don't
believe
that
the
intention
of
the
searcher
should
govern
the
outcome.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
against
intrusions
into
personal
privacy.
the
intrusion
is
equally
invasive
regardless
of
the
intent
of
the
individual
searching,
whether
it
be
for
some
innocuous
substance
such
as
bubble
gum
in
a
school
context
or
whether
it
be
for
a
dangerous
object,
such
as
a
weapon.
we
permit
the
intrusion--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--your
honor,
that
argument
could
be
made,
and
in
fact--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--this
case
came
out
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
ms.
lois
dejulio
the
decision
would
be
with
regard
to
a
school
disciplinary
proceeding.
the
law
is
unclear.
there
is
no
law--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
have
distinguished
between
the
types
of
proceedings
in
which
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
applied.
i
could
certainly
make
very
substantial
argument
that
a
school
disciplinary
proceeding
might
well
be
the
type
of
proceeding
to
which
we
would
want
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule.
however,
i
think
that
we
recognize
that
while
people
may
suffer
substantial
detriments
in
civil
cases
in
other
settings,
we
have
certain
very
strict
rules
that
we
apply
to
criminal
prosecutions
because
we
recognize
that
the
consequences
there
are
even
more
serious
than
might
be
the
case
in
a
comparable
civil
law
setting.
certainly
if
this
matter
had
come
up
on
the
appeal
from
the
ruling
of
the
chancery
court
in
this
matter
that
the
evidence
could
not
have
been
utilized
to
impose
a
disciplinary
sanction,
it
would
be
a
very
different
case,
and
i
think
the
arguments
that
would
be
made
on
both
sides
would
be
very
different.
that
was
not
the
case
here,
and
i
did
not
nor
can
i
at
this
point
definitively
make
the
arguments
that
should
be
made
on
both
sides
of
that
question.
i
do
feel
that
perhaps
the
briefs
filed
by
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
the
school
boards
associations,
really
address
arguments
that
ought
to
be
made
at
some
point
in
an
appropriate
appeal
where
the
issue
was
whether
the
illegally
seized
evidence
could
be
utilized
in
a
school
disciplinary
proceeding,
but
i
would
state
without
exception
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
criminal
law
proceeding,
the
exclusionary
rule
must
be
applied
when
a
state
seeks
to
introduce
fruits
of
an
illegal
search
into
its
direct
case
in
chief.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
i
was
called
by
the
new
jersey
department
of
education
subsequent
to
the
decision
in
the
state
court,
and
they
indicated
to
me
that
they
were
interested
in
making
that
kind
of
training
available,
but
then
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed,
and
i
believe
the
matter
has
been
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
outcome
of
the
matter
in
this
court.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
would
not
have
any
estimate.
i
couldn't
begin
to
tell
you.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
test
which
was
involved
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one.
reasonable
ground
is
a
very
flexible,
very
easy
concept
to
understand,
and
i
think
that
in
dealing
with
teachers
and
school
authorities,
we
are
by
definition
dealing
with
a
very
educated,
highly
motivated
group
of
people.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
certainly,
your
honor--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--i
think
that
public
school
teachers
are
already
on
a
continuing
basis
being
made
aware
of
a
variety
of
legal
concepts
that
do
impact
upon
education.
we
live
in
a
modern
society,
with
many,
many
laws,
and
certainly
schools
are
the
subject
of
much
litigation
and
many
statutes
and
many
regulations.
ms.
lois
dejulio
well,
your
honor,
as
i
indicated,
i
think
that
might
be
the
case
if
it
were
found
that
the
action
of
a
state
hospital
or
a
state
institution
rose
to
the
level
of
government
action
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
also,
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
complicated
educational
system,
the
continuing
education
of
teachers
in
all
aspects
is
something
that
is
rather
routine.
this
could
be
very
easily
incorporated
into
that
kind
of
ongoing
training
that
teachers
are
getting
in
their
academic
fields
and
other
related
areas.
perhaps
ironically,
many
teachers
themselves
are
responsible
for
teaching
their
students
constitutional
principles.
as
a
history
teacher,
i
was
required
to
teach
constitutional
law
to
my
students.
so
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
a
core
of
people
and
a
core
of
expertise
that
is
more
than
adequate
to
deal
with
whatever
demands
the
legal
standard
may
require.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
believe
that
when
he...
he
should
not
have
opened
the
pocketbook.
i
believe
that
the
search
of
the
pocketbook
was
independent
of--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--i
think
he
could
have
imposed
a
sanction
upon
the
student
based
upon
the
testimony
of
the
teacher
who
observed
her
smoking
a
cigarette
in
a
non-permitted
area.
ms.
lois
dejulio
and
that
would
have
been
the
extent
of
it.
i
think
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
possessory
offense,
and
the
search
of
her
purse
would
have
been
a
fishing
expedition.
ms.
lois
dejulio
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
dejulio
that
may
very
well
present
a
different
case,
because
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
held
not
to
apply
to
private
citizens
such
as
cases
involving
employers
searching
employees'
desk
drawers
and
it
may
be
that
a
private
school
teacher,
since
private
schools
are
different,
and
are
perhaps
not
subject
to
the
same
regulations
and
standards,
and
are
not
an
arm
of
the
government--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
very
much
oversimplifying,
and
i
think
it
is
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
rule
imposed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
would
not
prevent
a
teacher
from
conducting
a
search
if
he
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
student
had
drugs
in
a
purse
or
a
pocket,
and
i
think
that
the
cases
are...
the
reported
cases
are
legion
where
searches
were
conducted
under
a
reasonable
grounds
or
reasonable
suspicion
test
in
various
states,
and
the
teachers
were
upheld
because
they
did
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
student
either
possessed
drugs
or
some
other
substance
which
was
dangerous
to
them--
the
test
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
developed
was
one
which
took
into
consideration
the
special
problems
of
educators
while
at
the
same
time
recognizing
that
we
do
have
to
protect
the
rights
of
students
and
their
rights
to
personal
privacy.
the
state
counts
many
costs
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
type
of
circumstance,
but
it
does
not
consider
the
costs
that
society
will
suffer
if
we
fail
to
deter
unreasonable
searches
of
students.
for
every
search
of
a
student
that
uncovers
evidence
of
wrongdoing,
countless
other
students,
innocent
students,
will
have
had
their
privacy
violated,
and
some
of
those
intrusions
may
not
be
minimal,
but
as
some
of
the
reported
cases
show,
may
extend
to
such
extremes
as
strip
searches.
the
emotional
trauma
which
this
type
of
indignity
will
inflict
upon
impressionable
adolescents
is
a
cost
which
society
would
have
to
pay
and
which
should
not
be
ignored
in
any
cost
benefit
analysis.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
the--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--it
certainly
is,
and
certainly
the
question
of
dealing
with
drugs
and
other
criminal
conduct
in
the
schools
has
been
the
subject
of
many
studies
which
have
suggested
many
remedial
measures
that
could
be
implemented
to
attack
the
problem.
i
think
that
the
use
of
searches
is
at
best
a
bandaid
approach
to
a
problem
which
i
don't
think
any
educator
would
view
as
a
remedial
measure
of
first
choice.
certainly
the
drug
problem
has
to
be
dealt
with
and
should
be
dealt
with.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
to
throw
out
students'
fourth
amendment
rights
in
order
to
do
it.
the
drug
problem
in
society
at
large
is
certainly
a
serious
one,
but
we
have
not
permitted
the
police
to
throw
away
the
fourth
amendment.
we
have
not
completely
neutralized
the
fourth
amendment
protections
through
the
exclusionary
rule
in
order
to
attack
the
problem
of
drugs
or
weapons
in
our
society.
the
standard
which
was
imposed
below
was
a
compromise
that
recognized
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
children
you
perhaps
have
more
responsibility
than
when
you
are
dealing
with
adults,
and
that
may
justify
the
lesser
standard
that
was
imposed.
also,
the
court
specifically
stated
that
there
were
many
factors
which
could
be
taken
into
consideration,
such
as
the
age
of
the
child,
the
child's
prior
involvement
in
criminal
activity
or
disruptive
behavior,
the
nature
of
the
school's
own
problems,
all
of
which
would
be
considered
by
a
court
in
determining
whether
a
reasonable
grounds
existed
for
the
search
to
be
conducted.
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
particularly
in
the
school
context
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
deter
conduct
on
the
part
of
teachers,
that
while
teachers
are
not,
like
the
police,
directly
involved
in
the
criminal
justice
process,
they
do
have
some
interest,
substantial
interest
in
seeing
criminal
prosecutions
against
their
students
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion,
because
they
are
responsible
for
maintaining
order
in
the
school.
and
the
fact
of
a
juvenile
or
criminal
conviction
would
certainly
assist
the
school
in
dealing
with
a
dangerous
or
disruptive
student.
it
might
remove
the
student
entirely
from
the
school
by
means
of
a
custodial
disposition,
or
through
some
lesser
sanction
might
persuade
the
student
to
conform
his
conduct
to
school
norms.
so,
i
think
that
teachers
would
be
deterred,
and
do
have
some
incentive
to
follow
fourth
amendment
guidelines
that
would
ensure
that
no
evidence
would
be
suppressed
in
a
later
court
proceeding.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
in
the
school
context
that
the
exclusionary
rule
serves
an
educative
as
well
as
a
deterrent
function.
suppression
of
evidence
is
a
demonstration
to
society
as
a
whole
and
to
those
who
govern
us
that
we
value
highly
our
constitutional
rights,
and
we
attach
serious
consequences
to
those
who
violate
them.
if
we
expect
schools
to
teach
students
to
respect--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--your
honor,
the
serious
consequence
will
be
the
fact
that
the
subsequent
court
proceeding
stemming
from
the
illegal
evidence
that
was
discovered
will
be
dismissed.
ms.
lois
dejulio
your
honor,
i
think
in
many
ways
the
teacher
has
more
reason,
because
it
is
not
in
the
abstract.
the
teacher...
the
student
will
be
back
in
the
classroom.
ms.
lois
dejulio
but
the
teacher
does
have
the
responsibility
of
maintaining
order
and
discipline
in
the
school,
and
if
a
destructive
student
or
a
dangerous
student
is
not
dealt
with
in
the
criminal
justice
process,
then
the
school
may
have
to
deal
with
him
under
much
more
difficult
circumstances.
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
we
show
students
that
the
constitutional
system
of
government
is
more
than
a
collection
of
empty
promises,
and
that
by
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
these
circumstances,
we
protect
the
students'
fourth
amendment
rights
and
give
an
effective
deterrent
for
their
violation.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
think
that
the
teacher--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--i
think
that
the
impact
will
be
that
the
teacher
or
school
authority
will
learn
to
conform
their
behavior
to
the
reasonable
grounds
standard
which
was
adopted
and
which
was
the
basis
for
determining
whether
conduct
is
proper
or
improper
under
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
guarantees.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
think
that
teachers
will
have
to
learn
something
about
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that
they
already
have
to
learn
a
great
deal
about
law
and
how
law
impacts
upon
them
and
their
role
as
educators.
i
think
this
will
be
a
relatively
easy
lesson
to
teach,
and
certainly
we
are
dealing
with
professionals
in
the
area
of
teaching
and
learning.
in
conclusion,
i
would
merely
remind
the
court
that
we
opposed
the
granting
of
certiorari
and
continue
to
oppose
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
decision
below
was
based
upon
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
we
would
argue
based
its
decision
upon
independent
grounds
which
would
not
be
affected
by
any
modification
of
the
federal
law
which
was
cited
in
the--
ms.
lois
dejulio
--your
honor,
we
have
a
provision
in
our
state
constitution
which,
though
worded
very
similarly
to
the
federal
provision,
has
been
construed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
on
many
occasions
to
provide
broader
protections.
ms.
lois
dejulio
i
do
not
believe
that
they
do,
but
i
do
believe
that
in
this
case
they
determined
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
based
on
their
state
law
proceedings
and
on
provisions
of
the
state
constitution.
