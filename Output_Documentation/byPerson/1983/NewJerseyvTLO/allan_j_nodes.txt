mr.
allan
j.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
this
case
on
the
issue
of
the
applicability
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
the
school
searches
conducted
by
school
teachers
and
school
officials.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
was
observed
smoking
a
cigarette
in
a
school
restroom
by
a
teacher.
the
teacher
took
the
student
to
the
vice
principal's
office,
and
reported
the
incident
to
the
vice
principal.
after
the
vice
principal
left,
the
student
not
only
denied
having
smoked
in
the
restroom,
but
also
stated
that
it
couldn't
have
been
her
because
she
didn't
even
smoke.
after...
following
this
statement,
the
vice
principal
asked
for
the
student's
purse,
and
opened
the
student's
purse,
finding
a
pack
of
cigarettes
lying
on
the
top.
he
picked
up
the
cigarettes
and
said
something
to
the
effect
of,
"you
lied
to
me
about
smoking
cigarettes.
"
looked
back
in
the
purse,
and
saw
rolling
papers
for
cigarettes.
he
believed
these
were
indicative
of
the
presence
of
drug
paraphernalia
in
the
purse,
and
continued
to
look
through
the
purse.
he
found
marijuana
and
other
indications
that
the
marijuana
was
in
the
purse
for
purposes
of
distribution.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
distinction
under
new
jersey
law
between
a
minor
consenting
to
a
search
and
an
adult
consenting.
new
jersey
has
a
slightly
stricter
standard
than
the
federal
standard
concerning
consent,
and
it
would
have
been
absolutely
necessary
that
the
juvenile
be
aware
of
her
rights
prior
to
the
search
taking
place
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
consent
search.
because
of
this,
the
state
has
always
conceded
that
it
was
not
a
consent
search.
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
division
in
new
jersey--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
there
were
also
pieces
of
paper
indicating
that
various
other
people,
johnny,
people
like
that,
owed
her
$1,
$1.25,
things
like
that,
and
all
these
items
were
entered
into
evidence
at
the
juvenile
delinquency
proceeding
against
t.l.o.,
and
they
were
all
evidence
of
an
intention
to
distribute
the
marijuana
which
was
found
in
the
purse.
t.l.o.
was
adjudicated
a
delinquent
as
a
result
of
the
evidence
which
was
found,
and
the
trial
court
and
the
new
jersey
appellate
division
found
that
the
search
was
totally
proper.
however,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
found
that
the
search
exceeded
reasonable
grounds,
and
therefore
found
that
it
was
required
to
exclude
the
evidence
which
had
been
found
in
the
search.
now,
in
reaching
this
decision,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
found
that
due
to
the
amount
of
state
action
involved,
that
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
would
apply
to
this
situation,
and
we
have
not
protested
this
ruling.
in
addition,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
found
that
in
order
for
a
search
to
be
reasonable
under
the
united
states
constitution
in
the
school
search
context
the
person
conducting
the
search
must
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
search
will
uncover
evidence
of
a
crime
or
evidence
of
a
violation
of
school
discipline
or
school
regulations.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
it
was
applied
in
connection
with
a
juvenile
delinquency
prosecution.
the
rules
in
new
jersey
would
be
the
same
whether
it
was
a
juvenile
delinquency
prosecution
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
well,
the
primary
motion
that
was
made
by
the
defendant
was
for
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
and
the
first
question
that
had
to
be
reached
by
the
new
jersey
court
was
whether
or
not
under
any
circumstances
there
could
be
exclusion
of
evidence
illegally
taken
in
the
school
situation.
if
the
answer
to
that
question
was
no,
under
no
circumstances
would
this
type
of
evidence
be
excluded,
then
setting
a
standard
wouldn't
be
absolutely
necessary.
that
would
no
longer
really
be
in
controversy.
in
the
case,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
did
do
both.
it
did
set
the
standard
and
it
also
ruled
that
exclusion
was
warranted.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no,
our
argument
here
is
primarily
addressed
to
the
exclusionary
rule
issue.
we
basically
agree--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
believe
that
could
be
considered
a
question
subsumed
within
the--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--it
wasn't
our
intention
to
raise
it
because
we
agree
with
the
standard
that
was
set
forth
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
we
feel
that
that
is
a
workable
standard.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
they
have.
in
this
whole
area
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
difference.
there
have
been
courts
which
have
held
that
the
fourth
amendment...
they
have
gone
all
the
way
from
saying
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
even
apply
to
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
always
applies
and
exclusion
is
always
needed.
the
reason
we
didn't
specifically
address
the
issue,
though,
of
the
standard,
we
believe
both
counsel
have
addressed
that
issue
in
their
briefs,
in
footnotes,
and
we
have
set
forth
arguments,
and
the
arguments
were
made
before
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
is,
the
reason
we
didn't
address
it
is
because
we
think
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
set
forth
a
good
standard
and
a
workable
standard.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
our
quarrel
with
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
is
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
exclusionary
rule
works
as
a
deterrent
in
the
school
search
situation,
and
because
of
that
we
don't
feel
that
exclusion
of
evidence
from
a
later
criminal
proceeding
should
ever
occur
when
the
search
was
instituted
by
school
teachers
and
school
officials.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that
is
our
primary
contention.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
it
has
been
applied
in
other...
in
exclusionary...
in
other
administrative
search
contexts,
such
as
osha
searches--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--well,
yes.
i
am
not
certain
that
those
are
actually
administrative
searches.
the
people
involved
in
them
were
searching
for
evidence
of
arson,
which
is
definitely
a
crime,
and
it
often
wasn't
a
firefighter
per
se.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
believe
that
certainly
with
the
firefighters--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--yes,
i
believe
it
was.
the
persons
who--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
think
it
is
much
less
likely
that
a
school
official
will
be
deterred.
the
firefighter,
and
i
believe
in
both
clifford
and
tyler,
the
real
persons
who
were
doing
most
of
the
searching
were
either
fire
inspectors
or
police
who
were
called
in
by
fire
inspectors,
and
they
were
very
definitely
searching
for
evidence
of
a
very
serious
crime.
it
wasn't
an
administrative
search,
and
the
other
searches
that
are
closer
to
pure
administrative
searches,
such
as
cameron
and
barlows,
cases
like
that,
the
persons
who
were
doing
the
searches
on
a
regular
basis
conducted
searches
for
violations
of
civil
regulations
and
administrative
regulations.
that
was
their
primary
duty,
and
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
find
violations
and
it
was
clear
that
that
evidence
would
be
presented
in
the
trial.
that
was
their
primary
function.
i
think--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--it
is
our
contention
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
very
little
effect
on
a
school
teacher.
we
feel
that
there
are
other
means
of
teaching
school
teachers
compliance
with
the
constitution
and
ensuring
that
there
is
compliance
with
the
constitution.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
well,
i
think
that
what
it
is
is
that
if
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
be
applied,
and
if
it
is
to
have
any
effect,
it
can
work
only
under
very
limited
circumstances.
i
think
that
one
of
the
journals
pointed
out
in
the
respondent's
brief,
the
journal
of
law
and
education
set
forth
the
way
the
exclusionary
rule
could
work,
and
basically
the
journal
suggested
that
in
the
school
situation
administrators
and
teachers
could
identify
people
in
schools
who
were
likely
to
cause
trouble.
they
could
watch
where
these
students
went,
and
make
notes
of
where
they
went.
they
could
watch
who
these
students
associated
with
and
make
notes
of
that.
they
could
make
notes
of
whether
the
people...
the
students
seemed
to
sometimes
be
intoxicated,
seemed
to
be
acting
belligerent
seemed
to
be
cutting
classes,
seemed
to
be
late
a
great
deal
of
time.
and
basically,
what
it
sounds
like
is
that
in
order
for
the
rule
to
work,
school
teachers
are
going
to
have
to
turn
into
policemen,
and
they
have
to
turn
into
policemen
who
will
develop
a
dossier
on
a
student
before
conducting
a
search.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
think
this
case
presents
a
difficult
question,
and
it
was
a
question
obviously
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
in
the
new
jersey
courts,
and
that
is
why
there
was
a
split.
a
locked
briefcase
would
show
an
added
indication
that
the
person
had
an
expectation
of
privacy.
under
the
standard
set
up
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--possibly
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
it
was
a
standard
set
up
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
the
court
indicated
that
the
greater
the
intrusion,
the
more
significant
the
intrusion
the
higher
the
standard
would
have
to
be
in
any
event.
so
i
think
before
we
went
into
something
that
was
locked--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
think
it
would
better
be
classified
as
a
common
sense
approach
which
school
teachers
can
actually
use.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
absolutely.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
okay.
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
not
specifically
addressed
that
issue,
and
has
not
said
that.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
no.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that
is
correct.
i
would
note
that
a
chancery
judge
in
new
jersey
did
rule
in
this
case
that
evidence
would
be
excluded
from
the
disciplinary
proceeding.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that
is
not
before
us,
and
that
is
a
single
opinion
that
wasn't
contested.
our
only
contention
is
really
that
the
exclusionary
rule
shouldn't
apply
in
a
criminal
trial
when
the
search
was
conducted
by
school
officials.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
we
think
that
regardless
of
how
flagrant
it
would
be,
the
standard
would
be
the
same,
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
have
very
little
effect,
and
that
is
the
problem.
we
just
don't
believe
the
effect
is
there.
this
court
has
often
noted
that
there
is
a
balancing
test
that
must
be
used
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
applied
in
any
context.
for
instance
in
united
states
v.
havens,
the
court
allowed
excludable
evidence
to
be
used
for
purposes
of
impeachment.
in
united
states
v.
colandra,
possibly
excludable
evidence
was
allowed
to
be
presented
before
a
grand
jury.
in
u.s.
v.
janis,
the
court
allowed
evidence
which
had
actually
been
suppressed,
quashed
a
state
criminal
proceeding
to
be
introduced
in
a
federal
civil
proceeding.
in
stone
v.
powell,
this
court
found
that
the
additional
benefits
of
allowing
search
and
seizure
points
to
be
raised
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
context
would
be
slight
relation
to
the
costs.
i
think
that
all
these
cases
have
centered
very
square
on
the
idea
that
a
balancing
test
must
be
used,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
has
as
its
purpose
the
deterrent
effect,
and
that
we
must
be
sure
that
that
deterrent
effect
outweighs
any
detriments
of
the
exclusionary
rule
before
we
will
automatically
apply
the
rule.
i
believe
that
the
benefits
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
school
search
situation
are
really
very
limited
and
very
questionable.
the
rule
in
effect
punishes
law
enforcement
officers
for
transgressions
which
are
committed
by
law
enforcement
officers
and
transgressions
themselves
and
other
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
thank
you.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
recess
i
was
trying
to
explain
that
our
position
is
that
the
benefits
of
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
school
search
situation
would
be
very
questionable.
the
idea
of
the
rule
is
to
punish
law
enforcement
offers
for
offenses
committed
by
themselves
or
constitutional
transgressions
committed
by
themselves
and
by
other
law
enforcement
officers.
it
is
thought
that
those
who
are
in
charge
of
formulating
policies
for
law
enforcement
will
be
the
persons
most
greatly
affected,
since
they
will
be
the
prosecutors
who
will
lose
cases
if
there
is
not
compliance
with
the
constitution.
because
of
this,
the
rule
is
thought
to
have
the
effect
of
causing
education
of
the
police
officers
and
detectives
and
investigators
who
actually
conduct
searches,
and
by
this
means
the
entire
law
enforcement
community
will
be
given
an
incentive
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
this
simply
will
not
work
with
school
teachers,
because
they
are
not
a
part
of
this
law
enforcement
community,
and
their
interests
are
different
than
law
enforcement
officers.
they
do
obviously
have
an
interest
in
ensuring
that
there
is
discipline
in
the
schools.
this
interest,
however,
is
secondary
to
the
primary
interest,
which
is
to
educate
the
students.
the
primary
function
of
a
police
officer
is
law
enforcement.
a
policeman
becomes
a
policeman
because
of
an
interest
in
enforcing
laws.
a
school
teacher
becomes
a
school
teacher
because
of
an
interest
in
education.
because
the
interest
in
law
enforcement
is
so
secondary,
the
benefits
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
school
search
situation
would
be
even
less
than
they
are
in
the
general
criminal
law
situation.
this
court
has
noted
often
that
there
is
clearly
very
little
empirical
data
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
there
is
some
question
as
to
how
well
it
works
for
law
enforcement.
when
we
remove
the
person
who
is
doing
the
search
one
step
further
from
the
law
enforcement
and
one
step
further
from
the
trial
at
which
exclusion
will
occur,
there
is
much
more
question
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
much
more
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
actually
be
a
deterrent.
as
far
as
the
real
detriments
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
major
detriment
has,
of
course,
been
noted
on
many
occasions
by
this
court,
that
the
guilty
may
go
free
because
of
the
rule.
this
is
tolerated
because
the
rule
is
felt
to
foster
respect
for
criminal
laws
and
respect
for
our
system
of
criminal
justice
in
general.
but
as
justice
powell
writing
for
the
court
in
stone
v.
powell
noted,
the
indiscriminate
use
of
the
exclusionary
rule
could
actually
have
the
opposite
of
the
intended
effect.
it
could
actually
nurture
disrespect
for
our
criminal
laws,
and
could
actually
nurture
disrespect
for
our
system
of
criminal
justice.
this
is
obviously
a
detriment
any
time
the
exclusionary
rule
is
possibly
extended.
this
detriment
may
be
even
greater
in
the
school
search
situation
because
disrespect
of
our
criminal
laws
and
disrespect
of
the
system
of
justice
is
not
a
lesson
which
we
should
teach
our
students.
therefore,
before
the
exclusionary
rule
is
applied
to
school
searches
by
school
teachers
and
officials,
it
should
be
very
clear
that
the
benefits
of
the
rule
outweigh
the
detriments,
and
that
there
are
no
other
means
of
exacting
compliance
with
the
constitution.
we
believe
that
the
detriments
have
been
set
forth
very
clearly
and
that
the
benefits
are
very
limited,
and
the
only
way
that
we
could
really
get
a
beneficial
effect
from
the
exclusionary
rule
in
a
school
search
situation
so
that
it
would
foster
compliance
with
the
constitution
is
to
have
teachers
act
as
policemen,
to
have
teachers
follow
the
same
rules
as
policemen,
for
teachers
to
actually
investigate
as
policemen.
i
suggest
that
this
would
totally
change
the
educational
system
in
this
country.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
the
district
court...
the
supreme
court
of
alaska
found
that
the
fourth
amendment
in
a
drc
case
didn't
apply.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
remember
the
name
of
the
case
offhand,
but
i
know
there
have
been
district
courts
that
have
held
that.
i
could
supply
the
court
with
the
name
of
the
case.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
sir.
but
in
addition
to
this
detriment
that
would
occur
by
either...
by
changing
the
school
system,
by
using
the
exclusionary
rule
and
by
forcing
school
teachers
to
act
as
policemen,
we
believe
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
unnecessary
because
there
are
other
deterrents
in
the
school
situation
which
will
really
work.
as
this
court
noted
in
ingram
v.
wright,
the
school
situation
is
different
than
many
other
situations.
in
the
school
situation,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
community
interest
and
a
great
deal
of
parental
interest.
now,
in
that
case,
of
course,
this
court
found
that
if
corporal
punishment
in
a
public
school
went
too
far,
the
community
pressures
in
addition
to
possible
criminal
proceedings
and
possible
civil
proceedings
would
have
the
effect
of
stopping
further
transgressions.
we
suggest
that
this
would
be
at
least
as
true
in
a
school
search
situation,
and
we
suggest
that
the
more
egregious
a
search,
the
more
chances
the
deterrence
would
occur.
if
a
student
goes
home
and
complains
to
his
parent
that
he
has
just
been
the
subject
of
an
unreasonable
search,
there
is
a
high
likelihood
that
the
parent
will
complain
to
the
principal
or
to
the
board
of
education,
and
there
is
a
great
likelihood
that
the
principal
or
the
board
of
education
will
take
action
on
the
basis
of
that
complaint.
in
new
jersey,
as
in
many
other
states,
there
are
systems
for
bringing
community
complaints
to
boards
of
education.
if
a
complaint
were
filed
against
a
school
teacher
or
an
administrator,
the
local
board
of
education
would
consider
the
complaint,
and
if
there
was
merit,
they
would
report
the
complaint
to
the
state
board
of
education.
that
board
has
the
power
to
remove
tenure
from
the
school
teacher,
cause
the
school
teacher
to
be
fired,
or
to
revoke
the
license
of
a
school
teacher.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
type
of
a
real
deterrent
against
unlawful
actions
which
will
actually
work
and
which
will
actually
have
an
effect
on
school
teachers
and
on
school
administrators,
and
i
think
that
the
final
analysis
is,
we
will
find
that
if
unreasonable
searches
continue,
the
community
pressure
will
stop
them.
so
there
is
an
automatic
safeguard
in
place
to
unreasonable
searches
in
the
school
situation.
in
addition,
there
is
the
possibility
criminal
action
being
brought
against
a
student
or
teacher
who
conducts
an
unreasonable
search,
and
this
would
be
particularly
true
in
the
situation
of
a
possible
strip
search
or
a
search
of
that
type.
there
are
obvious
criminal
possibilities,
and
the
teacher
who
is
involved
in
a
search
like
that
or
the
official
would
have
to
consider
those
possibilities.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
think
there
would
be--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--admittedly,
there
would
be
very
little
chance
of
criminal
action
in
a
case
like
this.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
less
intrusive
search
than
many
others
that
have
been
referred
to
in
the
defendant's
brief,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
a
much
closer
call
than
in
many
of
the
other
situations
which
defendant
has
referred
to.
and
because
it
is
such
a
close
call,
there
would
be
less
of
a
chance
of
deterrence
obviously.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
while
finding
that
the
search
in
this
case
was
not
within
constitutional
bounds,
did
not
say
that
the
general
actions
of
the
school
vice
principal
were
totally
unreasonable,
but
just
that
they
were
unreasonable
under
the
constitution.
in
that
situation,
it
is
obviously
much
harder
to
deter.
i
think,
though,
that
this
case,
at
least
in
new
jersey,
has
taught
educators
what
the
framework
is
within
which
they
must
work.
i
think
because
of
this
case
they
have
learned
something,
regardless
of
whether
there
is
actually
exclusion
or
not.
there
is
also
the
chance
of
bringing
a
tort
action
or
a
1983
action
either
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court
against
a
teacher
or
a
school
official
who
unreasonably
searches
a
student.
these
types
of
things
have
been
known
not
to
be
effective
deterrents
in
the
law
enforcement
situation
where
law
enforcement
officers
are
dealing
primarily
with
criminals
and
people
who
on
the
most
part
are
found
to
have
contraband.
however,
in
the
situation
of
an
unreasonable
search
of
a
school
student,
i
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
much
greater
chance
that
a
1983
action
could
be
successful
because
the
school
student
is
simply
going
to
provide
a
much
more
sympathetic
figure
to
put
before
a
jury
when
requesting
damages.
and
even
if
damages
aren't
actually
returned
in
each
case,
the
school
teachers
and
school
officials'
awareness
of
the
possibility
of
damages
can
have
a
detrimental...
a
deterrent
effect.
defendant
or
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
in
wood
v.
strickland
this
court
limited
the
liability
of
school
officials
from
1983
actions,
and
said
that
they
would
not
be
liable
for
good
faith
violations,
and
the
respondent
points
out
that
this
would
limit
the
detrimental...
the
deterrent
effect
which
these
type
of
actions
can
have.
we
believe
that
these
cases
teach
another
lesson.
the
court
has
determined
that
because
of
the
realities
of
a
school
situation,
because
of
the
necessities
for
making
sure
that
there
is
discipline
in
schools,
that
schools
shall
be
treated
somewhat
differently,
that
school
teachers
and
administrators
shall
not
be
treated
precisely
as
law
enforcement
officers.
now,
having
limited
the
first
party
deterrent
effect
that
a
1983
action
may
have,
we
believe
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
try
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
constitution
by
means
of
a
third
party
deterrent,
and
in
the
school
search
situation,
that
is
what
the
exclusionary
rule
would
really
amount
to,
because
the
school
teacher
is
clearly
one
step
removed
from
the
police
officer
to
whom
they
turn
over
the
evidence,
and
that
person
is
one
step
removed
from
the
prosecutor
from
who
the
evidence
will
be
suppressed.
we
believe
that
in
an
ideal
situation
a
means
would
clearly
be
developed
to
ensure
that
the
constitution
was
complied
with
while
enforcement
of
criminal
laws
went
on.
this
court
has
noted
that
in
the
criminal
situation
this
wasn't
possible
and
therefore
a
choice
must
be
made
and
a
compromise
must
be
reached,
and
the
exclusionary
rule
was
set
up
as
a
choice,
as
compromise
between
ensuring
full
criminal
prosecution
and
ensuring
the
constitutional
rights
are
highly
regarded
by
law
enforcement
officers
and
other
state
officials.
we
now
are
facing
a
situation
where
we
don't
have
to
make
a
choice,
where
we
don't
have
to
accept
a
compromise.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
benefits
of
the
rule
would
be
slight,
but
we
do
have
other
deterrents.
we
can
teach
the
school
children
that
they
must
comply
with
the
criminal
laws
while
also
teaching
them
that
there
are
deterrents
in
place
which
will
ensure
that
their
constitutional
rights
won't
be
violated.
we
suggest
this
is
the
rule
we
should
be
teaching
these
students.
i
would
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
very
briefly,
in
regards
to
the
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
powell
concerning
police
training,
i
believe
that
the
general
rule
in
new
jersey
is
that
an
attempt
is
made
to
train
police
officers
at
least
twice
a
year,
and
they
are
given
updated
training
each
time
a
major
new
constitutional
decision
comes
down
which
impacts
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendment.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
am
aware
of
it
for
about
the
last
five
or
six
years.
i
am
just
not
aware
of
it
earlier
than
that,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
there
is
a
program.
i
do
not...
cannot
speak
to
the
frequency
for
each
municipality,
but
the
municipal
police
are
included
in
that
program.
after
this
decision
in
state
in
the
interest
of
t.l.o.
came
down
from
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
there
were
inquiries
from
school
boards
concerning
what
they
were
allowed
to
do,
and
these
inquiries
have
continued.
i
don't
believe
that
many
of
these
inquiries
have
related
to
what
can
we
do
in
order
to
ensure
that
you,
the
attorney
general's
office,
can
get
prosecutions.
they
simply
want
to
know
that
they
are
legally
entitled
to
do.
questions
have
always
been
asked
in
those
terms.
legally,
what
can
we
do
to
keep
the
schools
safe?
i
believe
the
interest
is
much
more,
what
can
we
do
to
actually
follow
the
law
and
to
ensure
that
we
won't
be
subject
to
civil
liability
later
on.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
well,
i
think
it
would
come
up
in
other
contexts.
i
think
it
would
come
up
in
the
context
such
the
wood
v.
strickland
context.
it
would
later
have
to
be
determined
in
a
case
like
that.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
that's
correct.
we
don't
believe
the
exclusionary
rule
will
do
that.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
we
didn't
contest
the
constitutional
violation.
that
is
correct.
we
didn't
contest
it
because
we
believe
that
the
court
never
needed
to
reach
that,
because
the
exclusionary
rule
did
not
automatically
have
to
be
applied
in
any
event.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
i
don't
know
if
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
or
provide
another
deterrent,
so
you
have
to
teach
people...
yes,
people
have
to
know
what
the
fourth
amendment
says,
and
then
there
has
to
be
a
deterrent
to
their
violating
and
doing
what
they
know
is
wrong.
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
in
many
cases--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
believe
under
this
case
that...
although
in
some
cases
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
has
given
broader
protections--
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
allan
j.
nodes
yes,
in
the
consent
area.
in
general,
the
opinions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
are
followed
in
new
jersey.
