unknown
speaker
mr.
nodes,
under
new
jersey
law,
can
a
minor
consent
to
a
search?
unknown
speaker
you
left
out
one
item
in
the
pocketbook,
the
$40.
unknown
speaker
you
left
out
one
item
in
the
pocketbook--
unknown
speaker
--which
was
$40
in
$1
bills,
which
signified
that
she
was
selling
it.
unknown
speaker
you
left
that
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nodes,
in
your
question
presented
for
certiorari,
you
say
whether
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
searches
made
by
public
school
officials
and
teachers
in
school.
now,
the
unwary
might
think
that
you
were
talking
perhaps
about
an
administrative
proceeding
where
someone
has
been
kicked
out
of
school,
wondering
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply
in
that,
but
here
the
exclusionary
rule
is
applied
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
in
connection
with
a
criminal
prosecution
of
this
person,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is
the
standard
supporting
a
search,
aren't
we,
in
a
school,
rather
than
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
in
this
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
so
your
argument
i
take
it
is
primarily
addressed
to
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
it
is
open
to
us
to
deal
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
search?
unknown
speaker
but
it
wasn't
your
intention
to
raise
it?
unknown
speaker
courts
around
the
country
have
differed
somewhat
on
that
standard,
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
is
your
quarrel
with
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
so
teachers
and
school
administrators
should
not
be
treated
the
same
way
as
policemen
and
law
enforcement--
unknown
speaker
--has
the
exclusionary
rule
been
applied
in
other
administrative
search
contexts?
unknown
speaker
or
fire
protection
people,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
in
the
other
context,
do
you
think
it
was
based
on
a
deterrence
rationale?
unknown
speaker
in
administrative
contexts?
unknown
speaker
but
you
somehow
think
that
school
officials
can't
be
deterred?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
view
that
school
officials,
regardless
of
the
exclusionary
rule's
application,
would
continue
to
do
what
they
always
have
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
so,
then
how
can
you
square
that
with
your
argument
that
the
application
of
the
rule
will
create
havoc
in
the
schools?
it
just
seems
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
girl
involved
had
a
locked
briefcase,
would
it
have
been
all
right
to
break
it
open?
unknown
speaker
but
a
closed
pocketbook
wouldn't
be?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
seen
a
woman
that
didn't
take
her
pocketbook
without
a
purse?
unknown
speaker
that
could
be
classified
as
free-wheeling.
unknown
speaker
but
sometimes...
anyway.
general
nodes,
let
me
just
ask
you
this
question,
if
i
may,
following
up
on
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you,
on
the
effect
of
what
you
are
asking
for.
you
are
not
challenging
the
standard
or
the
application
of
the
standard
in
this
case.
you
are
taking
a
broad
position,
as
i
understand
you,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
simply
doesn't
apply
in
the
criminal
context
when
the
search
is
made
by
a
school
official.
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
the
new
jersey
court,
it
would
permit
these
searches
to
go
ahead
and
let
the
results
of
the
search
be
used
for
school
disciplinary
purposes
and
management
of
the
school
without
any
deterrent
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
but
this
case
doesn't
preclude
that.
unknown
speaker
all
this
case
deals
with
is
whether
after
the
material
is
obtained
it
can
be
used
for
criminal
purposes.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
no
matter
how
flagrant
the
violation
might
be.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
on
this?
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
before
lunch,
there
is
apparently
some
diversity
among
the
states
as
to
what
the
right
standard
is,
but
we
don't
reach
that
question.
i
was
wondering,
have
any
of
the
states
that
have
addressed
this
question,
has
any
court
held
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply?
unknown
speaker
but
any
court
that
has
held
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
violated
but
you
don't
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
to
school
teachers?
unknown
speaker
federal
district
courts?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
criminal
action
would
there
be
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
visual,
charged
with
looking?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
ms.
dejulio,
that
all
of
these
events
that
took
place
here
took
place
not
in
the
principal's
office,
but
after
the
young
lady
got
home,
and
it
was
her
mother,
not
the
school
teacher.
unknown
speaker
and
lay
aside
for
a
minute
how
the
police
get
the
evidence,
but
do
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
enters
that
setting?
unknown
speaker
let
me
follow
that
now.
the
mother
is
called
to
the
school
by
the
principal,
and
the
whole
episode
occurs
just
as
it
did
here,
except
that
the
mother
orders
the
girl
to
open
her
purse.
the
same
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
said
that
the
parent
didn't
give
it
to
the
police
here.
the
principal
of
the
school
then
takes
the
evidence
after
the
mother
directs
the
daughter
to
disclose
it.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
hypothetical
question?
let's
assume
you
have
a
patient
in
a
state
hospital,
and
the
hospital
has
a
patient
who
has
been
forbidden
to
smoke,
and
the
nurse
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
particular
patient
is
smoking,
and
searched
his
or
her
purse.
you
would
have
the
same
situation?
would
you
or
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
i
am
thinking
about
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
the
nurse
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
were
cigarettes
there
and
when
the
purse
was
opened
found
marijuana.
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
found
the
search
was
not
reasonable,
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
a
state
hospital
would
be
similar
in
that
respect,
wouldn't
it,
to
a
public
school?
unknown
speaker
so
the
hospital
would
be
in
the
same
situation
generally
that
the
school
is?
unknown
speaker
could
you
help
me?
what
do
you
think
the
predicate
is
for
a
legal
search
by
a
school
officer
of
a
young
lady's
purse?
under
new
jersey
law,
i
take
it
it
is
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
satisfied
with?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
in
full
force
in
the
school
context?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you
what
you
think.
unknown
speaker
and
you
still
are
submitting
that?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you
what
you
think
the
standard
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
search
of
what
is
involved
here,
search
of
a
purse.
unknown
speaker
why
would
you
dispense
with
the
warrant
requirement?
unknown
speaker
so
the
fourth
amendment
rules
really
don't
apply
in
their
full
force
in
the
school
context?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
comfortable
with
that?
unknown
speaker
without
a
warrant.
search
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
no
ground
for
excluding
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
hardly
get
a
warrant
anyway,
could
they?
unknown
speaker
difficult?
i
don't
know
how
they
could
even
get
a
warrant.
they
aren't
law
enforcement
officials,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
ms.
dejulio,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
presence
of
exigent
circumstances
dispenses
with
the
need
for
probable
cause
as
well
as
the
need
for
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
a
terry
standard
would
be
enough
then?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
issue
isn't
before
us?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
as
it
comes
to
us
we
must
accept
the
notion
that
there
was
no...
not
even
reasonable
suspicion
or
reasonable
grounds.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
he
found
the
marlboro
cigarettes,
he
had
more
evidence
towards
probable
cause
than
he
did
before
he
found
them,
because
she
had
said,
i
don't
smoke,
and
that
shows
that
she
lied
as
to
saying
that
she
didn't
smoke,
and
therefore
supports
an
inference
that
she
lied
in
her
other
denials.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
was
proof
positive
that
she
had
lied,
or
a
very
strong
inference
that
she
had
lied
when
she
said
she
didn't
smoke.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
you
don't
need
a
whole
lot
more
than
that,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
only...
as
you
have
suggested
yourself,
there
is
only
one
question
here,
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
which
i
suppose
assumes
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
and
that
even
so,
the
evidence
should
not
be
excluded.
unknown
speaker
when
you
use
the
term
"criminal,
unlawful
conduct",
you
are
speaking
of
the
teacher's
conduct
in
opening
the
purse,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
that
that
is
perfectly
valid
for
the
teacher
to
do
that
in
terms
of
dealing
with
school
discipline.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
before.
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
say
at
all
or
concede
at
all
that
a
school
official
may
search
a
purse
just
as
a
routine
matter
without
reasonable
grounds
and
use
that
as
a
matter
of
school
discipline?
unknown
speaker
without
ever...
and
with
no
intention
of
ever
presenting
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
then
on
the
facts
of
this
case
if
you
are
right
that
there
was
no
reasonable
grounds
to
search
the
purse
that
you
would
object
to
the
use
of
the
fruits
of
that
search
to
impose
any
kind
of
discipline
on
this
person.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about...
what
is
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
the
answer
be
the
same?
if
the
school
officer
has
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
student,
why
would
the
evidence
be
usable
against
him?
unknown
speaker
ms.
dejulio,
may
i
ask
you
a
somewhat
different
type
question?
i
am
sure
you
know
that
many
states
conduct
rather
intensive
educational
programs
for
police
officers
to
make
sure
that
they
know
their
duty
and
the
basic
legal
principles
applicable
to
the
performance
of
those
duties.
had
new
jersey
instituted
any
such
programs
for
the
education
of
its
teachers?
unknown
speaker
how
many
public
school
teachers
are
there
in
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
instruction
new
jersey
gives
its
police
officers?
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
exclusionary
rule
cases
at
every
term
of
this
court,
and
i
am
told
by
law
enforcement
officers
that
every
time
we
hand
down
a
new
decision,
that
requires
a
new
briefing
of
the
police.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
idea
that
should
be
done
in
the
public
school
system?
unknown
speaker
and
this
also
would
have
to
be
done
in
the
hospitals?
unknown
speaker
ms.
dejulio,
when
the
principal
saw
the
pocketbook
and
knew
the
facts
around
it,
what
then
could
he
do
legally
in
your
mind?
how
much?
unknown
speaker
what
could
he
have
done?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
dejulio,
you
have
private
secondary
schools
in
new
jersey,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
same
facts
here
took
place
in
a
private
school,
and
instead
of
being
a
public
school
principal
it
was
a
headmaster
or
headmistress.
different
case?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
youngster
wants
to
get
into
drugs,
he
had
better
stay
in
the
public
school
side?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
costs
to
the
children
of
other
parents
to
whom
this
young
lady
is
selling
drugs?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
social
cost
of
some
importance,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
said
serious
consequences
on
those
who
violate
them.
the
teacher,
in
your
view,
violated
the
rights.
now,
what
is
the
serious
consequence
on
the
teacher?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
abstract,
the
teacher
perhaps
couldn't
care
less.
unknown
speaker
but
the
teacher,
unlike
the
policeman,
is
not
involved
in
a
criminal
justice
project
or
law
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
teacher
having
suffered
this
penalty
that
you
describe
is
thereafter
not
going
to
be
concerned
about
whether
students
are
using
marijuana
or
other
drugs?
unknown
speaker
what
is
going
to
be
the
impact
on
the
teacher?
unknown
speaker
then
as
justice
powell,
i
think,
suggested,
teachers
had
better
take
a
course
on
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
in
that
connection
whether
apart
from
the
federal
cases,
does
new
jersey
have
its
own
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
new
jersey
has
an
exclusionary
rule.
i
know
you
have
argued
they
have
a
broader
protection
of
fourth
amendment.
do
they
have
an
independent
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
that
been
going
on,
if
you
know,
this
kind
of
police
training?
unknown
speaker
is
that
for
municipal
as
well
as
state
police?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
there
were
no
exclusionary
rule
they
would
lose
interest
in
knowing
what
the
law
was?
unknown
speaker
so
they
wouldn't
have
this
problem
of
trying
to
find
out
what
the
fourth
amendment
means
anyway,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
the
outcome
of
this
case
really
won't
affect
the
teachers'
need
for
or
desire
for
education
about
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
if
you
wanted...
if
you
only
raised
the
single
question
about
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
if
you
wanted
to
argue
about
the
fourth
amendment,
you
should
have
come
up
here
with
another
question.
you
seem
to...
you
come
here
on
the
assumption
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
part
of
your
argument
is
that
the
teachers
would
like
to
know
what
the
fourth
amendment
means,
because
you
would
expect
that
they
would
obey
it
then.
unknown
speaker
and
there
wouldn't
be
the
same
temptation
to
disobey
it
that
there
is
in
law
enforcement?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
exclusionary
rule
rests
on,
at
least
a
lot
of
people
think
so,
not
everybody,
on
its
deterrent
effect,
and
you
must
exclude
the
evidence
to
deter
police
conduct
that
is
violative
of
the...
it
isn't
enough
for
them
to
know
what
the
fourth
amendment
means.
you
must
also
exclude
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well,
actually,
in
new
jersey
is
it
not
just
the
fourth
amendment,
since
the
protections
of
the
counterpart
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
state
constitution
apparently
broader
than
we
have
said
they
were
under
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
your
teachers
have
to
know
what
the
state
constitution
guarantees
are,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
in
the
consent
area.
unknown
speaker
in
the
consent
area.
