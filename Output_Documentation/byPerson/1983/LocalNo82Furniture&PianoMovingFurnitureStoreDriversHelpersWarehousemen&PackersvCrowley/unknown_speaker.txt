unknown
speaker
who
ends
up
paying
for
the
arbitrator
or
whoever
it
is
the
court
appoints?
unknown
speaker
would
there
have
been
that
sort
of
expense
to
either
party
if
the
secretary
had
brought
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
were
the
procedures
for
the
election
under
the
court
order
like
the
procedures
that
the
secretary
would
follow
under
iv?
unknown
speaker
can
you
say
briefly
what
the
difference
would
be?
unknown
speaker
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
in
my
mind
is
the
violations
here
concern
the
nomination
meeting
as
i
remember.
unknown
speaker
would
you
make
basically
the
same
argument
that
you
make
today
if
the
action
had
been
brought
promptly
after
the
nomination
meeting
after
the
alleged
violations
occurred?
unknown
speaker
would
not
some
of
your
policy
arguments
be
equally
strong
about
having
the
wrong
people
running
the
election
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
question
really
is
at
what
point
in
time
has
an
election
been
conducted.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
little
different
theory
than
judge
campbell
had
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
could
have
happened
if
they
had
brought
the
suit
right
after
the
nomination
meeting.
the
only
effective
remedy
might
be
a
court
supervised
election.
unknown
speaker
surely
if
ballots
had
been
cast
you
think
the
election
has
in
effect
been
had?
unknown
speaker
there
was
not
any
legislative
history
about
title
i
except
in
the
floor.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not
go
through
a
committee?
unknown
speaker
no
hearings
on
that
aspect
of
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
written
on
the
floor?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
had
quarrel
with
some
language
in
calhoon,
or
what
was
the
other?
unknown
speaker
was
an
election
conducted
this
january?
unknown
speaker
december.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
it
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
can
it
enjoin
one?
i
suppose
it
can
in
the
sense
if
you
can
set
aside
nominations.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
agreed
they
could
set
aside
nominations
under
title
i.
unknown
speaker
the
only
request
is
to
hold
a
new
nominating
meeting.
unknown
speaker
there
cannot
be
an
election
without
some
nominations.
unknown
speaker
so
appropriate
injunctive
relief
is
acceptable.
unknown
speaker
now
if
you
go
that
far,
supposing
they
do
decide
we'll
have
to
have
the
election
two
weeks
late
because
of
the
nomination
and
we've
enjoined
the
old
elections.
they
have
a
new
nomination
meeting,
and
i
will
order
that
there
be
some
impartial
observer
at
the
election.
he
would
have
no
power
to
enter
that
kind
of
an
order?
unknown
speaker
any
relief
that
pertains
to
the
conduct
of
an
election
itself
is
beyond
his
statutory
power?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
he
could
not
delay
the
election
two
weeks
and
then
say
go
ahead
and
conduct
it
pursuant
to
your
normal
rules.
unknown
speaker
he
could
change
the
date
of
the
election
but
could
otherwise
exercise
no
supervision
whatsoever
over
it.
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
is
the
secretary's
action
under
title
iv
subject
to
review?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
merely
a
question
of
exhaustion
rather
than
judicial
power?
unknown
speaker
mr.
witlen,
who
would
invoke
the
secretary's
authority?
unknown
speaker
well,
take
your
situation.
suppose
there
had
been
an
injunction
setting
aside
the
initial
nominating
meeting
and
calling
for
another
one,
and
at
that
point
they
had
one
and
nominees.
now,
how
do
you
get
the
secretary
in?
unknown
speaker
but
there
has
to
be
that
waiting
period
of
30
days
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
assuming
you
have
a
nomination
meeting
and
the
election
is
two
weeks
later.
now
under
title
i
you
can
go
right
into
court
i
gather.
you
do
not
have
to
wait
30
days?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
in
this
case
was
there
objection
to
the
order
before
it
was
entered
by
counsel?
unknown
speaker
by
anybody.
unknown
speaker
was
it
ever
pointed
out
to
the
court
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
run
the
election?
unknown
speaker
this
was
before
the
court
entered
the
judgment
or
afterwards?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
i
assume
you
have
no
trouble
with
mootness
either?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
complain
about
this
last
election.
you
do
not
find
any
fault
with
this
last
election.
unknown
speaker
where
does
the
secretary
draw
the
line
between
title
i
and
title
iv?
unknown
speaker
unless
he
gives
title
i
no
room
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
case?
was
title
iv
the
exclusive
remedy
for
anything
that
happened
at
that
nominating
meeting?
unknown
speaker
no,
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
what
under
title
i
could
these
complainants
have
done?
unknown
speaker
after
the
election,
that's
all.
sought
damages.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
they
might
have
run
into
court
and
got
an
injunction
setting
aside
the
nomination
meeting
as
your
colleague
here?
unknown
speaker
so
the
secretary
says
that
that
kind
of
injunctive
relief
would
be
barred?
unknown
speaker
but
the
union
does
not
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
could
the
court
order
that
they
be
considered
nominated
and
be
put
on
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
most
courts
do
not
get
these
things
heard
in
two
or
three
days.
that
might
take
two
or
three
weeks
to
even
get
before
the
judge
for
a
decent
hearing.
can
he
enter
a
restraining
order
meanwhile?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
no
you
are
in
effect
saying
there
is
no
title
i
relief
for
anything
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garvey,
i
have
one
little
question.
on
this
mootness
point
you
ask
us
to
order
that
the
ballots
be
returned
to
the
petitioner.
what
good
does
that
do?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
you
ask
us
to
do
at
this
stage.
unknown
speaker
so
we
just
ignore
the
new
election?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
do
with
the
new
election?
unknown
speaker
can
we
have
something
to
do
with
deciding
it,
or
do
we
have
to
just
leave
it
all--
unknown
speaker
--you
did
not
bring
this
case
to
the
secretary.
you
brought
it
to
us.
unknown
speaker
they
did
not
stipulate
to
the
fact
that
there
should
be
a
new
election.
unknown
speaker
they
never
agreed
that
a
court
should
run
it.
they
never
stipulated...
i
do
not
suppose
they
would
even
be
here
if
they
thought
it
was
all
right
for
the
court
to
run
the
election.
unknown
speaker
how
often
do
district
courts
get
into
that
posture?
unknown
speaker
once
ordered,
why
can't
the
district
judge
let
the
secretary
take
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
secretary
of
labor
could
order
that.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
the
secretary
act
without
the
court
action?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
stern,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
secretary's
procedures
including
judicial
review
mean
that
there
is
a
two
year
delay
in
conducting
a
local--
unknown
speaker
--are
there
any
statistics
to
support
that?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
elections
had
been
completed
and
the
ballots
been
taken
out
and
counted,
then
would
there
be
a
title
i
remedy
based
on
the
allegedly
illegal
nominations?
unknown
speaker
after
the
election
is
actually
conducted.
unknown
speaker
the
ballots
cast
and
counted,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
triggering
the
secretary's
authority.
is
the
conduct
of
the
election
the
counting
of
the
ballots?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
decided
that
the
courts
are
just
too
slow.
before
the
election
could
you
go
to
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
think
the
secretary
would
have
any
jurisdiction
or
authority
whatsoever
if
somebody
complained
to
go
into
court
and
enjoin
the
election
that
has
not
been
held
yet?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
law
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
gave
it
to
members,
but
did
it
also
take
it
away
from
the
secretary
completely?
unknown
speaker
after
the
election...
let's
assume
before
the
election
the
only
complaint
is
that
nominations,
the
very
nominations
here.
you
say
that
you
can
go
right
into
court
before
the
election
to
remedy
that.
after
the
election
you
have
to
complain
to
the
secretary
about
the
very
same
title
i
violation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stern,
don't
all
these
arguments
go
to
whether
this
particular
judge
handled
this
particular
matter
in
a
proper
way
rather
than
the
power
of
the
court
to
handle
it
at
all?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
opponents
even
though
they
may
not
phrase
it
in
terms
of
power
they
say
there
is
virtually
no
power
in
a
district
court
until
after
the
election
has
been
conducted
in
trying
to
figure
out
when
the
election
has
been
conducted.
there
is
an
awful
lot
of
argument
between
the
parties
about
whether
the
judge
did
everything
right
or
whether
he
was
too
slow
or
the
union
was
recalcitrant
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
all
entirely
immaterial
in
this
case.
we
are
dealing
with
a
rather
narrow
question
of
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stern,
may
we
come
back
a
minute
to
the
discussion
you
had
previously?
in
this
case
the
district
court
entered
the
picture
one
day
before
the
ballots
were
being
counted,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
entered
the
injunction
that
the
ballots
not
be
counted
the
day
before
they
were
to
be
counted.
unknown
speaker
right.
if
that
procedure
is
appropriate
the
secretary's
authority
always
could
be
usurped
by
a
federal
court,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
that
is
what
i
do
not
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
do
understand
that,
but
if
a
violation
of
title
i
is
claimed
could
the
court
always
enjoin
the
counting
of
the
ballots?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask,
say
the
election
had
taken
place
in
this
case
and
you
went
to
the
secretary
and
complained
and
he
investigated
and
thought
that
the
nominating
process
was
defective
and
a
new
election
should
be
running.
then
he
has
to
sue
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
goes
to
court,
what
does
he
have
to
prove?
unknown
speaker
what
it
is
a
violation
of?
title
i?
unknown
speaker
so
the
two
sections
overlap
in
the
sense
that
he
would
prove
there
was
a
violation
in
the
nominating
process.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
just
happens
to
be
a
violation...
it
was
a
violation
of
title
i
also.
unknown
speaker
he
goes
to
court.
what
kind
of
a
decree
does
he
get?
unknown
speaker
assume
he
does.
unknown
speaker
by
the
secretary.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
pursuant
to
regulations
that
the
secretary
has?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
terms
that
the
court
dreams
up.
unknown
speaker
i
will
put
it
to
you
this
way.
if
this
election
had
already
gone
on
and
you
went
to
the
secretary
and
he
goes
and
makes
his
case
before
the
court
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
election,
if
the
judge
had
then
ordered
the
election
pursuant
to...
exactly
the
way
he
did
in
this
case,
he
would
be
violating
title
iv,
would
he
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
secretary
had
a
set
of
rules
as
to
how
new
elections
were
to
be
run.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
court
can
displace
them?
unknown
speaker
is
the
court
constrained
by
the
regulations
the
secretary
has
issued
as
to
how
new
elections
are
to
be
run?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
exclusivity
means
hardly
anything
there.
unknown
speaker
what
about
my
last
question?
unknown
speaker
in
published
regulations?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
