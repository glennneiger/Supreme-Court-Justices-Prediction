mr.
gary
s.
witlen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today
we
ask
the
court
to
determine
whether
union
elections
of
officer
are
to
be
run
under
the
supervision
of
the
federal
judiciary
or
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
key
question
is
whether
a
court
can
order
a
union
to
conduct
a
new
election
of
officers
under
title
i
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
in
response
to
a
suit
filed
by
someone
other
than
the
secretary
of
labor.
it
is
our
position
that
congress
vested
the
secretary
and
only
the
secretary
with
authority
to
bring
suit
to
rerun
an
election
of
union
officers.
congress
repeatedly
rejected
other
enforcement
schemes
including
suit
by
individual
union
members
both
before
and
after
the
addition
of
title
i
to
the
legislation,
and
all
of
the
bills
considered
over
the
course
of
two
sessions
of
congress
relied
upon
the
secretary
of
labor
as
the
agent
of
government
to
supervise
the
rerun
of
union
election
of
officers.
thus,
we
seek
reversal
of
the
lower
courts
and
reaffirmation
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
that
title
iv,
not
title
i,
is
to
be
utilized
to
resolve
challenges
to
elections
of
union
officers.
we
ask
that
the
ballots
cast
by
the
members
of
local
82
in
the
1980
election
be
returned
to
the
union
for
tabulation.
i
would
like
to
highlight
several
of
the
facts
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
brief.
first,
suit
here
was
filed
based
upon
alleged
violations
of
titles
i
and
iv
of
the
act
which
occurred
at
the
union's
nomination
meeting.
the
suit
was
not
filed
until
after
the
union
had
mailed
the
mailed
balloting
packets
to
its
members
for
voting
in
the
election.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
subsequently
issued
without
an
evidentiary
hearing
some
17
hours
before
the
ballots
were
to
be
picked
up
and
tabulated
for
the
stated
purpose
of
preserving
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
in
this
case,
from
having
to
go
through
the
electoral
processes
of
challenging
an
election
under
title
iv.
as
a
result
the
union
was
unable
to
elect
officers
for
an
additional
year
after
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued.
in
the
interim
the
union
was
run
by
officers
who
had
been
elected
four
years
previously.
the
new
election
ordered
by
the
court
was
conducted
under
its
rules
and
under
its
court
appointed
arbitrators.
presently
pending
before
the
district
court
these
many
years
later
is
the
application
for
attorneys'
fees
on
behalf
of
respondents,
is
a
request
for
permanent
relief,
is
the
union's
expected
expense
for
reimbursement
for
the
costs
of
the
election
that
was
conducted
under
the
court's
order,
and
for
petitioner
harris'
claims
for
wages
if
it
should
be
found
that
he
was
the
successful
candidate
in
the
1980
election.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
the
union
paid
for
the
entire
cost
of
the
election
including
the
arbitrator
with
the
understanding,
which
was
discussed
at
the
time,
that
the
union
could
seek
reimbursement
from
the
plaintiffs
if
the
district
court's
injunction
was
ultimately
overturned.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
certainly
some
of
the
expenses
of
conducting
an
election
would
have
been
incurred,
but
the
major
expense,
that
in
excess
of
$7,000
to
pay
the
arbitrator's
expenses
would
not
have
been
incurred
because
the
secretary
of
labor
does
not
charge
the
union
for
its
expenses
and
personnel
in
conducting
the
election.
that
is
the
greatest
bulk
of
the
expense.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
there
were
major
discrepancies
between
what
the
secretary
would
do
and
what
the
union
would
do
and
what
the
court
ordered.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
primarily
the
arbitrators
that
were
appointed
did
not
have
the
expertise
of
the
secretary
to
make
evaluations
as
to
the
application
of
the
secretary's
own
administrative
regulations
or
the
union's
constitutional
regulations
and
requirements.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
we
would
not
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
suit
was
brought
prior
to
the
time
the
ballots
were
mailed
out.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
if
we
were
to
address
that
question
prior
to
calhoon
and
ignoring
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
we
would
say
that
the
public
policy
issues
and
the
legislative
history
arguments
clearly
discern
a
congressional
intent
that
there
be
no
pro-election
title
i
relief.
the
arguments
that
we
made
were
in
recognition
of
the
language
in
calhoon
and
in
bachowski
that
seems
to
recognize
some
appropriate
role
for
a
court
under
title
i.--
therefore,
the
line
we
are
asking
is
a
line
that
we
would
be
happy
to
see
the
court
extend,
i.e.,
to
say
there
is
no
title
i
relief,
but
we
think
that
the
line
can
be
drawn
in
our
favor
in
this
case
without
going
that
far.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
no,
it
is
not
the
whole
point
because
that--
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
--it
is
only
marginally
different
from
judge
campbell.
our
basic
theory
is
that
once
you
get
to
the
point
where
the
only
remedy
in
order
to
grant
the
relief
requested
is
to
conduct
a
new
election
the
court
does
not
have
title
i
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
i
think
at
that
point
the
court
could
have
merely
nullified
the
nomination
meeting
and
gone
back
to
the
union
and
say
do
it
again.
there
had
been
no
ballots
printed
or
distributed
at
that
time.
i
agree,
however,
that
the
logic
of
the
public
policy
arguments
and
the
logic
of
the
legislative
history
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
is
that
even
at
that
point
the
court
should
not
have
had
title
i
jurisdiction
to
challenge
even
the
nomination
meeting
considering
the
nomination
meeting
to
be
part
of
the
election.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
certainly,
which
is
the
case
in
this
case.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
it
was--
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
--no,
there
is
no
discussion
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
bachowski.
the
legislative
history
that
we
have
been
referring
to,
i
believe,
makes
at
least
three
things
clear
about
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
passing
this
statute.
first,
is
that
title
iv
was
intended
to
be
the
specific
vehicle
for
resolving
disputes
concerning
the
conduct
of
union
election
of
officers.
that
procedure
and
section
402
procedures
wet
intended
to
provide
the
exclusive
means
of
obtaining
an
order
setting
aside
an
election
and
providing
for
a
rerun.
finally,
the
statutory
goals
of
democratic
elections
could
not
be
insured
by
any
agent
of
the
government
other
than
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
it
bears
repeating
that
all
of
the
bills
considered
in
the
house
and
the
senate
provided
that
rerun
elections
were
to
be
conducted
by
the
secretary
of
labor
regardless
of
how
you
happen
to
get
to
the
point
of
having
an
order
to
rerun
the
election.
i
submit
that
this
case
provides
a
textbook
example
of
how
the
safeguards
and
objectives
carefully
established
in
title
iv
will
inevitably
be
nullified
when
a
court
acting
under
title
i
is
permitted
to
substitute
its
judgment
as
to
how
an
election
should
be
conducted
for
that
of
the
secretary,
the
congress
or
the
union
involved.
for
example,
the
statute
specifies
that
elections
are
to
be
conducted
no
less
frequently
than
once
every
three
years
and
that
the
winners
are
to
be
installed
regardless
of
whether
there
is
a
challenge
to
the
outcome
of
that
election.
well,
here
we
did
not
have
an
election
for
four
years,
and
in
the
interim
we
had
lame
duck
officers
responsible
for
running
the
union.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
there
was
an
election
conducted
in
december
of
1983.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
yes.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
there
are
a
number
of
arguments
made
on
behalf
of
why
it
is
not
moot.
first
is
that
in
order
to
resolve
the
matters
presently
pending
before
the
district
court
we
must
have
the
determination
from
this
court
as
to
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
type
of
relief
it
ordered.
second,
the
court
itself
has
held
in
glass
bottle
blowers
the
happenstance
occurrence
of
an
intervening
election
does
not
deprive
either
the
secretary
or
the
courts
of
the
authority
to
back
to
investigate
a
prior
election
in
order
to
determine
whether
any
of
the
alleged
violations
which
occurred
in
that
election
could
have
tainted
the
second
election.
we
think
that
is
certainly
the
case
here.
one
of
the
issues
that
was
never
resolved
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
the
legality
of
the
continuous
good
standing
requirement
as
a
condition
of
eligibility
to
run
for
office.
that
is
a
question
that
has
not
been
resolved.
finally,
we
believe
that
this
case
would
fall
within
the
court's
general
parameters
of
a
case
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
because
of
the
short
time
limitation
and
the
time
it
takes
to
get
a
case
up
to
this
court.
another
statutory
goal
that
cannot
be
accomplished
under
title
i
is
that
of
specifying
that
the
statute
only
specifies
minimal
government
intervention
in
union
affairs
and
leaves
it
to
the
unions
to
establish
rules
in
its
bylaws
as
to
how
the
election
will
be
conducted.
the
union
has
been
found
to
be
free
to
conduct
its
elections
in
accordance
with
its
own
procedures
so
long
as
the
procedures
comply
with
the
statute.
here
in
contrast
the
district
court
issued
an
injunction
which
provided
for
detailed
rules,
took
the
entire
administration
of
the
election
procedures
out
of
the
hands
of
the
union
and
placed
them
into
the
hands
of
arbitrators
that
it
happened
to
find
willing
to
conduct
this
type
of
an
election.
most
importantly,
congressional
history
indicates
an
intent
to
reserve
challenges
to
the
conduct
of
the
election
until
after
the
election
has
been
completed
and
to
prevent
any
faction
in
the
union
from
delaying
the
election,
and
even
once
that
election
was
completed
if
a
member
sought
to
challenge
its
outcome,
court
intervention
was
to
be
delayed
until
after
the
union
was
given
an
opportunity
to
review
the
problem
and
attempt
to
redress
the
grievance.
then
if
a
member
was
dissatisfied
with
the
union's
action
until
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
agent
of
government
most
familiar
with
the
union's
affairs,
conducted
an
investigation
and
made
a
determination
not
only
that
there
was
a
violation
but
the
violation
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
elections
were
not
to
be
set
aside
merely
for
technical
violations,
and
they
were
only
to
be
set
aside
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
case.
here
the
relief
that
was
granted
was
granted
after
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
never
was
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
respondents
were
not
required
to
exhaust
the
internal
union
procedures,
and
the
union
was
not
given
full
advantage
of
those
procedures
to
remedy
this
matter
itself.
there
was
no
compliance
with
the
time
limitations
which
severely
restrict
the
amount
of
time
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
to
investigate
a
complaint
and
file
a
suit.
most
importantly
the
procedures
entirely
ignored
the
secretary
of
labor,
precluding
him
from
investigating
the
complaint,
precluding
him
from
being
able
to
attempt
to
settle
a
complaint
before
it
was
actually
filed
in
court,
precluding
him
from
serving
as
a
screening
agent
to
prevent
the
court
from
spending
time
on
frivolous
issues,
and
preventing
him
from
consolidating
all
of
the
potential
litigation
concerning
the
outcome
of
the
election
in
one
proceeding
before
one
court.
in
fact,
by
deciding
some
of
the
issues
here
under
title
i
but
deferring
other
issues
for
a
title
iv
proceeding,
the
district
court
in
essence
insured
that
there
will
be
two
elections,
two
suits
to
challenge
the
outcome
of
this
election.
indeed,
by
not
resolving
the
24
consecutive
month
continuous
good
standing
eligibility
requirement
the
court
did
not
even
guarantee
that
his
own
election
was
to
be
protected
from
a
challenge
after
that
election
had
been
challenged.
thus,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
statutory
goals
can
be
accomplished
in
a
proceeding
under
title
i.
for
that
reason
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
ever
be
appropriate
within
the
meaning
of
section
102
for
a
court
acting
under
title
i
to
grant
the
relief
of
ordering
a
union
to
conduct
a
new
election
of
officers.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
it
would
depend
at
what--
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
--it
would
depend
at
what
point
the
election
was
sought
to
be
enjoined
and
what
relief
was
being
requested.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
and
that
the
election
be
enjoined
until
such
time
that
that
could
take
place.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
if
that
type
of
suit
was
brought
prior
to
the
mechanics
of
the
balloting
taking
place
and
it
relied
upon
a
legitimate
title
i
basis
for
its
complaint
then
we
think
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
suggest
that
the
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
a
suit.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
it
might
be
appropriate
under
the
correct
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
anything
which
inserts
the
court
in
the
actual
conduct
of
the
election,
i
believe,
is
beyond
the
statutory
power.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
not
in
the
appropriate
circumstances,
and
that
is
when
the
suit
is
in
fact
based
upon
a
legitimate
title
i
issue
and
when
it
has
been
brought
at
a
time
before
the
balloting
has
taken
place.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
certainly.
under
this
court's
decision
in
bachowski
a
member
who
has
been
denied
a
new
election
from
the
secretary
can
seek
review
of
the
secretary's
decision.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
certainly.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
courts
have
no
role
in
the
conduct
of
elections,
but
merely
that
that
role
was
deliberately,
intentionally
and
repeatedly
delayed
until
after
these
other
procedures
had
been
exhausted,
the
union's
exhaustion
and
the
secretary
of
labor's
exhaustion.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
any
complaining
member
has
a
right
to
go
to--
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
--any
of
the
respondents
could
have
filed
a
complaint
with
the
union
and
30
days
thereafter
gone
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
there
has
to
be
a
time
for
the
union's
procedures
to
work
and
then
either
30
days
after
not
getting
a
decision
from
the
union
or
30
days
after
the
union
decision
then
they
go
to
the
secretary.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
exhaustion...
i
should
say
there
is
an
exhaustion
requirement,
but
it
is
more
easily
waivable
by
the
district
court
than
the
statutory
requirement
under
title
iv.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
available.
mr.
gary
s.
witlen
i
would
be
happy
to
start
with
it,
justice
white.
the
problem
with
mr.
stern's
analysis
at
that
point
is
that
he
misconstrues
the
statute.
the
terms
of
the
election
that
the
secretary
conducts
are
the
terms
set
by
the
secretary.
