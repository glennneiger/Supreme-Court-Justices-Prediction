mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
saying
a
word
about
the
question
that
justice
brennan
asked,
how
if
the
secretary
had
conducted
this
election
might
it
have
been
run
differently.
let
me
give
a
few
general
examples
and
then
a
few
specific
examples.
section
402
of
title
iv
says
that
when
elections
are
to
be
rerun
they
are
to
be
rerun
in
accordance
with
regulations
that
the
secretary
is
to
promulgate.
those
regulations
appear
in
part
in
452
of
29
cfr.
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
in
running
the
election
the
secretary
would
be
more
familiar
with
the
operation
of
those
regulations
than
would
a
court.
the
second
difference
is
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
district
judge
had
rerun
a
teamster
election,
and
he
was
no
doubt
not
as
familiar
with
the
teamster's
constitution
and
bylaws
as
the
secretary
would
be
because
this
would
not
be
the
first
time
the
secretary
had
rerun
a
teamster's
election.
some
more
particular
examples
might
be
one
of
the
things
that
we
do
not
find
in
the
district
court's
injunction
that
the
secretary
does
do
in
the
course
of
elections
is
to
read
all
of
the
publications
that
are
sent
out
in
the
course
of
the
election,
not
just
campaign
materials,
but
the
secretary
rereads
the
proofs
of
the
newspaper
that
the
union
circulates,
for
example,
to
make
sure
that
it
does
not
support
one
side
rather
than
the
other.
you
do
not
see
any
provision
for
that.
so
in
that
sense
the
secretary
would
often
do
more
than
the
district
court,
and
in
some
cases
the
secretary
would
do
less
than
the
district
court
did.
for
example,
the
injunction
here
provides
that
the
arbitrators
were
actually
to
run
the
nominations
meeting
so
that
means
somebody
would
be
up
at
the
podium
running
the
meeting.
when
the
secretary
has
a
nominations
meeting
rerun
they
have
a
pre-election
conference
at
which
the
rules
for
conducting
the
meeting
will
be
set
out,
and
there
will
be
an
observer
there
to
take
notes
to
make
sure
that
things
to
all
right.
but
it
will
not
actually
be
run
by
the
secretary.
so
sometimes
they
do
more.
sometimes
they
do
less.
sometimes
they
simply
do
things
differently.
for
example,
in
the
joint
appendix
i
notice
in
the
district
court's
docket
that
one
of
the
issues
that
arose
in
the
course
of
this
election
was
a
question
about
whether
james
miller
was
eligible.
under
the
district
court's
injunction
those
questions
about
eligibility
were
to
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
arbitrators
and
then
taken
to
court.
if
the
secretary
had
been
rerunning
the
election
and
there
were
nothing
faulty
about
the
union's
own
procedures
toward
determining
eligibility
requirements
the
appeals
on
eligibility
questions
would
have
followed
those
normal
procedures
to
the
union's
general
president
and
then
the
general
executive
board
and
then
to
the
secretary.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
by
the
secretary
or
by
the
parties?
mr.
john
h.
garvey
there
was
considerable
negotiation
in
the
district
court
once
it
had
been
decided
that
the
court
was
going
to
enjoin
the
election.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
yes,
indeed.
i
believe
that
was
the
basis
for
the
union's
objection.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
was
before
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction.
the
secretary
did
not
intervene
in
this
action
until
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
we
do
not,
your
honor,
both
for
the
reasons
mentioned
by
petitioners
and
because
we
believe
that
the
district
court
by
grabbing
the
ballots
in
this
case
has
prevented
the
secretary
from
performing
his
role
in
the
title
iv
statutory
scheme
up
until
today
up
until
these
ballots
are
released.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
there
have
not
been
any
complaints.
the
secretary
is
not
entitled
to
act
on
his
own
until
he
receives
a
complaint,
and
to
date
there
have
been
none.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
address
in
the
time
i
have
remaining.
let
me
first
say
a
word
about
where
we
get--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--no,
that
is
not
so.
the
secretary
does
give
plenty
of
room
for
title
i.
the
line
that
we
would
draw
is
that...
let
me
back
up
just
one
step
and
tell
you
where
we
get.
in
the
statute
we
think
congress
could
have
been
a
little
bit
more
explicit
than
it
was
about
how
titles
i
and
iv
ought
to
fit
together,
but
we
think
it
gave
at
least
three
signals.
the
first
of
those
is
that
section
402
sets
out
a
very
detailed
system,
which
mr.
witlen
outlined,
for
rerunning
elections.
the
second
signal
is
that
section
102
as
you
suggested
cautions
the
district
courts
in
title
i
cases
that
they
are
to
provide
only
such
relief
as
is
appropriate.
the
third
signal
that
congress
gave
is
in
section
403
which
says
that
the
title
iv
procedure
for
challenging
an
election
which
has
been
already
conducted
shall
be
exclusive.
now,
that
language
does
not
solve
this
case
completely
or
we
would
not
be
here,
but
its
purpose,
i
think,
provides
considerable
assistance
because
the
reason
congress
put
it
in
the
statute
was
that
congress
did
not
want
the
courts
rerunning
elections.
in
line
with
all
of
that
the
line
that
we
would
propose
for
accommodating
these
is
that
title
i
relief
should
never
be
considered
appropriate
under
section
102
if
title
iv
relief
is
adequate
to
resolve
the
election
violations
that
are
being
complained
of.
let
me
give
an
example
or
two
about
what
kinds
of
title
i
relief
would
be
appropriate
in
the
context
of
union
officer
elections.
one
is
the
finnegan
case
that
this
court
decided
two
years
ago.
that
involved
complaints
about
equal
rights
and
free
speech
in
the
context
of
a
union
officer
election.
you
may
recall
that
there
a
union's
business
representative
had
been
discharged
after
supporting
the
incumbents
who
lost
the
election.
in
that
sort
of
case
there
is
not
relief
available
under
title
iv
because
what
he
wanted
was
reinstatement,
and
running
a
new
election
would
not
give
him
that
necessarily.
let
me
give
another
example.
in
the
sadlowski
case
decided
the
same
term
as
finnegan
there
was
again
a
complaint
about
free
speech
rights
in
connection
with
a
union
officer
election.
there
the
complaint
was
that
the
union
had
improperly
amended
its
constitution
to
forbid
nonmember
campaign
contributions.
in
that
case
title
iv
relief
would
not
be
adequate
because
there
was
not
an
election
even
on
the
horizon.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
do
not
know
that
title
iv
is
the
exclusive
remedy
for
anything
that
happened--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--in
this
case,
but
the
election
could
only
be--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--might
have
sought
damages.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
they
might
have
sought
damages.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no.
we
would
draw
the
line
short
of
that
point,
and
the
reason--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--that
is
right.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
mr.
witlen
represented
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
that
strict
about
it,
but
we
would
draw
the
line
short
of
rerunning
the
nominations
meeting
because
that
kind
of
relief
unlike...
well,
let
me
give
you
another
example
in
the
course
of
this
election
about
what
might
have
been
done.
suppose
that
these
respondents
were
complaining
that
they
had
not
been
given
ballots.
i
think
that
injunctive
relief
under
title
i
might
be
appropriate
to
direct
that
they
be
given
ballots.
now
that
sort
of
relief
unlike
rerunning
the
nominations
meeting,
unlike
what
happened
here
in
that
sort
of
situation
there
is
not
the
delay
of
the
election
which
is
involved
here.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
i
am
reluctant
to
say
no
because
professor
cox
suggested
in
the
course
of
the
senate
hearings
on
this
that
that
might
be
an
appropriate
remedy
to
order
in
this
case
that
mr.
lynch's
name
be
put
on
the
ballot
for
secretary/treasurer,
but
again
that
unlike
rerunning
the
nominations
meeting
does
not
involve
any
delay,
does
not
get
the
court
involved
in
the
details
of
how
the
meeting
should
be
run.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
gives
me
trouble.
even
if
the
district
court
did--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--i
am
perfectly
willing
to
say
that
there
is
no
equitable
title
i
relief
for
the
problem
in
this
case
because
the
title
iv
relief
is
perfectly
adequate
to
resolve
this
problem.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
the
kinds
of
violations
that
the
district
court
suggested
might
be
meritorious,
the
exclusion
of
lynch
from
the
ballot,
the
exclusion
of
crowley
and
others
from
the
nominations
meeting
would,
if
proven,
be
title
iv
violations
that
would
justify
rerunning
the
nominations
meeting
and
rerunning
the
election,
precisely
the
relief
that
the
district
court
afforded
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
respondents
has
advanced
any
advantage
that
title
i
actually
holds
over
title
iv
procedures
in
the
context
of
this
very
case.
one
of
the
suggestions
that
is
made
is
that
somehow--
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
it
is
only
after
the
ballots
have
been
counted
that
a
claimant
is
entitled
to
come
to
the
secretary
with
a
complaint.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
that
is
right.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
no,
not
necessarily.
what
would
happen
is--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--perhaps
nothing,
but
that
is
the
decision
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
secretary.
if
the
ballots
are
counted
and
if
the
complaint--
mr.
john
h.
garvey
--perhaps
eventually
after
the
secretary
brings
a
suit.
mr.
john
h.
garvey
we
did
indeed
to
complain
that
the
district
court
had
prevented
has
prevented
the
secretary
from
acting.
if
i
may
just
answer
your
question
about
what
you
should
do.
if
the
ballots
are
returned
to
the
petitioners
they
will
then
be
counted.
members
are
at
that
point
entitled
to
complain
to
the
secretary
about
the
violations
which
the
district
court
unsuccessfully,
we
suggest,
attempted
to
remedy.
at
that
point
under
402(b)
the
secretary
is
to
determine
if
there
are
violations
which
have
occurred
and
not
been
corrected.
now
it
is
possible
that
the
secretary
will
conclude
that
as
a
result
of
the
district
court's
rerun
and
the
subsequent
supervening
1983
election
that
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
ignore
the
1983
election
and
do
it
all
over
again.
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
so,
and
that
is
a
decision
which
cannot
be
made
until
the
case
is
brought
before
the
secretary.
