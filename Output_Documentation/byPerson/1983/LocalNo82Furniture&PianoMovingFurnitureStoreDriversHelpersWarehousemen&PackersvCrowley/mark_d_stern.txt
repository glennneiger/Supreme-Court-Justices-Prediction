mr.
mark
d.
stern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
raised
on
this
appeal
are
less
numerous
and
of
less
general
application
than
the
government
and
the
union
have
suggested.
the
mootness
issue
here
is
primarily
one
of
whether
a
party
may
seek
to
disturb
on
appeal
portions
of
a
district
court
order
to
which
it
stipulated,
namely,
the
running
of
a
new
election.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
they
did
not
stipulate
to
its
being
court
supervised.
they
specifically
stipulated
to
a
new
election
in
an
attempt
to
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction,
and
i
mention
only
after,
your
honor,
they
heard
the
evidence
in
the
preliminary
injunction
hearings
did
they
make
that
offer.
it
was
not
because
of
the
temporary
restraining
order,
justice
white,
but
after
they
heard
the
evidence
that
they
made
that
offer
when
they
realized
this
was
going
to
be
rerun
at
one
point
or
another,
and
it
would
be
less
disruptive
and
less
unsettling
to
the
union
to
rerun
it
sooner
rather
than
later.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
they
did
not
feel
it
was
all
right
for
the
court
to
run
the
election,
and
in
fact
that
is
why
the
factors
mentioned
by
the
government
existed.
the
union
refused
to
run
the
election.
the
union
refused
to
run
the
election
meeting.
the
union
refused
to
name
arbitrators.
the
union,
in
fact,
blocked
the
triple
a
from
being
the
arbitrators
rather
than
honor
ballot
association
by
calling
them
up
and
telling
them
they
did
not
approve
of
that.
the
union
did
not
have
any
publications
to
be
sent
out.
it
did
not
have
any
publications
that
were
sent
out.
so
it
was
not
because
the
secretary
did
not
run
this
election,
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
the
meeting
or
in
determining
who
was
going
to
run
that
meeting.
it
was
because
the
union
refused
to,
and
strictly
because
the
union
refused
to.
now,
the
second
issue
in
this
litigation
is
as
was
mentioned
by
justice
o'connor
and
justice
marshall
whether
the
election
has
become
moot
as
a
result
of
the
december,
1983
election,
and
i
suggest
you
have
to
really
stretch
the
imagination
as
the
secretary
of
labor
did
to
come
up
with
a
reason
why
this
case
is
not
moot
on
that
account.
lastly
the
one
question
on
the
merits
that
is
before
the
court
is
whether
a
district
court
is
so
restricted
in
its
remedial
powers
under
title
i
of
the
landrum
griffin
act
that
it
cannot
order
minimal
supervision
and
the
few
terms
it
actually
imposed
on
the
union
to
remedy
the
flagrant
violations
of
title
i
that
occurred
in
this
case.
now,
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
fact
that
when
a
title
iv
election
is
rerun
it
is
the
court,
not
the
secretary
of
labor,
that
sets
the
terms
for
rerunning
that
election.
it
is
the
secretary
of
labor
who
investigates
the
complaint
and
who
goes
and
observes
the
election,
but
it
is
the
court
that
sets
the
terms.
it
is
not
as--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--every
time
there
is
a
recalcitrant
union
that
does
not
settle
the
matter.
in
conciliation
proceedings
the
court
must
get
into
that
posture.
the
secretary
has
no
power
to
order
a
new
election.
a
court
must
order
it.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
he
can,
but
i
believe
the
practice
is
that
the
secretary
submits
a
proposed
order
to
the
court
and
the
court
acts
on
the
proposed
order,
and
therefore
it
is
the
court's
order
that
is
in
fact
what
determines
the
terms.
what
opposing
parties
argue
here
is
not
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
because
the
secretary
concedes
that
as
do
the
union
and
the
government
and
the
afl-cio.
what
they
do
argue
in
essence
is
that
the
only
power
a
court
has
is
to
grant
damages
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
i
point
out
to
your
honors
that
this
election
suit
was
filed
three
weeks
after
the
nomination
meeting,
just
one
week
later
than
the
union
says
would
have
been
proper
and
all
right.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
when
the
ballots
went
out,
but
i
suggest
that
if
they
had
gone
out
by
the
three
week
time
they
probably
had
gone
out
by
the
two
week
time.
in
fact,
to
rule
that
when
the
ballots
go
out
is
the
determining
factor
gives
every
union
a
way
out
of
getting
any
relief
under
title
i.
as
soon
as
nominations
are
made
you
walk
over
to
the
printer,
xerox
your
ballots
and
you
mail
them
out.
it
takes
a
day.
nobody
can
get
into
court
with
that
speed
and
get
relief.
now,
an
award
of
damages
cannot
correct
a
violation
in
a
nomination
meeting.
it
cannot
correct
a
violation
that
takes
place
during
an
electoral
process
but
before
the
conclusion
of
it.
all
it
can
do
is
attach
a
stigma
to
the
person
who
complains
about
the
violation
of
having
gotten
damages
against
the
union,
taken
money
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
union
for
him
or
herself,
a
stigma
that
they
cannot
get
rid
of.
now
if
they
had
accomplished
something
else,
gotten
a
new
election
run,
in
the
process
that
stigma
would
not
be
serious,
but
having
no
other--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--yes,
but
if
you
have
a
recalcitrant
union
the
secretary
of
labor
in
practice
cannot
order
that
until
the
term
has
virtually
run
out
for
the
people
elected
unlawfully.
it
takes
an
average
of
two
and
a
half
years
with
cases
litigated.
the
maximum
term
under
the
act
is
three
years.
that
is
more
than
75
percent
of
the
term
having
been
sat,
and
the
union
run
by
people
unlawfully
elected.
anyone
unlawfully
elected
can
take
the
90
days,
not
30
days,
under
the
act
that
they
must
give
the
union
to
consider
the
matter
internally,
take
the
60
days
with
the
secretary
and
delay
on
top
of
that
another
two
years
in
the
courts
before
an
order
is
issued.
it
does
not
take
much,
if
any,
skill
to
do
that.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
only
if
the
union
agrees
and
if
you
have
a
person
who
has
engaged
in
flagrant
violations
of
title
i,
justice
o'connor,
i
suggest
that
is
not
the
person
who
will
agree,
who
will
make
the
conciliation
or
correct
it
internally.
that
is
a
determination
of
fact
that
judge
keeton
made
in
this
case.
the
proposition
that
damages
are
the
only
relief
that
can
be
effectively
granted
in
an
electoral
process
under
title
i
flies
in
the
face
of
the
legislative
history,
the
language
and
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
act,
and
it
is
incompatible
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
act.
in
hall
v.
coal
this
court
determined
that
district
courts
have
great
flexibility
and
discretion
in
fashioning
appropriate
remedies
for
violations
of
title
i.
in
the
steelworkers
decision
this
court
determined
that
in
the
electoral
process
title
i
rights
are
particularly
critical
and
deserve
vigorous
protection.
to
separate
those
two
propositions
from
each
other,
to
except
the
one
from
the
other
and
visa
versa
largely
nullifies
title
i
in
what
this
court
has
determined
to
be
the
most
important
area
for
its
functioning,
and
i
would
also
suggest
virtually
the
only
area
in
which
members
of
unions
interested
in
promoting
democracy
in
their
union
in
fact
do
come
forward
and
act.
title
i
confers
on
union
members
comparable
rights
to
those
we
possess
as
citizens
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
landrum
griffin
act,
the
right
to
free
speech,
assembly,
equal
treatment
under
the
law,
due
process.
title
iv
governs
the
particulars
of
an
election
process.
as
a
remedial
statute
the
landrum
griffin
act
is
to
be
broadly
construed
to
express
its
goals.
to
adopt
the
position
urged
by
the
government
and
the
union
in
this
case
will
largely
nullify
title
i
in
the
area
that
has
been
determined
by
this
court
to
be
its
most
important
area,
to
function
and
frustrate
the
congressional
goals
expressed
in
the
preamble
to
the
act.
adoption
of
our
position--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--an
average
of
two
and
a
half
years,
justice
brennan,
which
is
more
than
75
percent
of
the
term.
i
believe
it
would
be
five-sixths
of
the
term.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes.
they
were
cited
in
our
brief
and
referred
to
in
the
law
review
articles
that
have
compiled
those
statistics.
that
is
not
the
average
for
every
complaint
brought
to
the
secretary.
it
is
the
average
cases
that
go
to
litigation.
you
have
to
assume
that
an
officer
willing
to
violate
title
i
in
the
flagrant
fashion
that
these
officers
did
is
going
to
use
every
opportunity
for
delay
under
the
act
and
will
fall
into
the
two
and
a
half
year
average.
now,
as
i
indicated
before
damages
is
a
liability,
not
a
remedy,
under
title
i,
and
the
granting
of
damages
will
chill,
not
foster,
the
further
exercise
of
democratic
rights
by
union
members.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
history
of
this
act
that
recalcitrant
union
leaders
who
unlawfully
influenced
an
election's
results
are
not
to
be
removed
in
an
expeditious
and
democratic
fashion.
in
fact,
the
history
of
the
act
indicates
that
they
should
be
removed
once
it
has
been
determined
that
they
are
unlawfully
elected.
the
district
court
in
this
case
issued
its
orders
after
factual
hearings
held
within
the
first
month
that
this
complaint
was
brought
and
determined
that
the
officers
were
unlawfully
elected.
in
fact,
the
union
concurred
in
that
by
coming
forward
as
soon
as
it
heard
the
evidence
and
saying
a
new
election
should
be
run.
the
union
alone
in
this
cases
suggests
that
the
language
already
conducted
in
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
commenced,
as
soon
as
matters
are
commenced.
the
secretary
of
labor
backed
off
that
position
in
its
brief
and
reply
brief.
in
fact,
it
says
at
the
present
time
that
this
election
still
is
not
completed
and
that
it
is
not
proper
for
members
to
raise
title
iv
complaints
about
this
until
the
ballots
are
taken
out
and
counted.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
be
saying
that
no
injunctive
relief
can
be
granted
right
after
the
nominations
meeting.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
no.
we
think
the
point
in
time
of
counting
the
ballots
and
letting
the
people
know
where
they
came
out
is
in
fact
the
time
that
title
iv
talks
about
as
removing
any
matter
into
the
area
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
secretary.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
that
would
be
the
conducting
of
an
election.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
other
than
injunctive
relief...
injunctive
relief
would
be
barred.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
the
conduct
of
the
election...
the
election
would
be
conducted
at
the
point
that
the
ballots
are
counted.
to
make
it
any
point
earlier
could
make
it
possible
for
a
union
to
accomplish
that
act
the
day
after
the
nomination.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
no.
there
is
no
way
you
can
go
to
the
secretary
before
the
election.
he
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
secretary
only
has
remedy.
a
hydrogen
bomb,
wipe
out
the
old
election
and
start
fresh
and
new.
the
secretary
has
no
flexibility
to
remedy
a
minor
violation
and
let
the
election
proceed.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
he
does
not.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
the
cucho
amendment
took
that
power
away
from
the
secretary
and
gave
it
to
members.
that
is
what
the
cucho
amendment
was.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes.
the
secretary
says
in
his
own
regulations
that
he
has
no
power
to
remedy
title
i
violations,
that
they
are
to
be
remedied
by
a
different
means
by
a
member
in
court.
that
is
stated
in
his
regulations.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes,
and
if
it
was
intentionally
done
you
can
expect
that
it
will
be
two
and
a
half
years
later
that
it
is
remedied
if
you
wait
till
after.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
a
few
points
made
by
opposing
counsel
in
response
to
questions
presented
by
the
court.
first,
the
24
hour
rule...
the
court
below
did
not
determine
that
there
would
have
to
be
two
court
cases
because
the
24
hour
rule
was
enforced
in
the
election
that
took
place
in
1981,
and
no
objection
was
made
to
its
going
there
so
there
would
not
be
a
second
case
about
it.
secondly,
the
union
in
this
case
could
have
suggested
a
third
party
with
the
expertise
satisfactory
to
it.
instead
it
chose
to
frustrate
the
selection
of
the
third
party
and
agreed
to
accept
the
third
party
that
was
nominated
without
agreeing
to
the
supervision
of
the
court
in
general.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
handle
title
i
violations,
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
in
this
case--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--yes.
i
believe
union's
recalcitrance
is
germane
to
the
court's
consideration
on
one
point,
and
that
is
what
the
alternative
remedy
to
these
members
would
be
when
you
have
a
person
who
is
recalcitrant
and
willing
to
delay
the
processes
that
exist
under
title
iv
and
only
relevant
to
that
point.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
no.
it
entered
the
picture
before
that.
that
is--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--a
temporary
restraining
order,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
your
honor,
i
think
the
number
of
cases
that
this
could
occur
in
are
minimal,
and
that
is--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--because
it
could
only
occur
in
an
overlap
case
in
the
first
place
where
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
title
i.
this
court
determined
that
a
court
cannot
do
that
where
there
are
violations
of
title
iv
and
only
violations.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes,
it
could
if
it
deemed
it
appropriate.
it
might
deem
lesser
remedies
appropriate.
unfortunately
the
secretary
only
has
one
choice
and
that
is
all
or
nothing.
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
stepping
in
the
day
before
and
giving
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
holding
off
for
several
months
before
entering
its
final
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case
in
a
sense
promoted
the
purpose
of
this
act
that
the
opposing
counsel
hearsay
were
frustrated.
it
allowed
the
union
to
engage
in
conciliation
and
get
a
prompt
resolution.
it
just
conciliated
in
front
of
the
court
and
in
fact
the
conciliation
was
successful.
the
union
proposed
all
but
several
very
minor
terms
of
the
order
with
the
exception
of
the
court's
supervision,
and
those
minor
terms
of
the
order
to
which
the
union
objected
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
running
of
the
election.
it
had
to
do
with
enjoining
future
violations
and
the
like
and
not
posting
bonds
for
the
appeal.
secondly,
it
afford
the
union
as
much
of
an
opportunity
to
voluntarily
redress
the
wrongs
that
had
been
engaged
in
as
a
title
iv
process
would
have.
it
just
supported
it
at
an
earlier
time,
and
it
did
not
encroach
on
title
iv's
principle
of
not
removing
persons
elected
from
office
until
it
is
reasonably
clear
their
election
was
unlawful.
it
was
reasonably
clear
as
soon
as
the
evidence
was
heard
in
this
case,
and
judge
keeton
so
determined.
the
processes
engaged
in
by
the
district
court
here
and
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
balance
the
rights
and
remedies
provided
in
titles
i
and
iv
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
them
to
compliment
each
other
rather
than
conflict
with
each
other.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm--
mr.
mark
d.
stern

he
has

the
violations
occurred
but
that
they
may
have--

a
violation
of
title

would
not
allow
the
secretary
to
seek
relief
afterwards.

fine.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
first
he
has
to
prove,
justice
white,
that
the
outcome
may
have
been
affected.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
then
he
gets
a
decree
that
provides
for
the
election
to
be
run
under
certain
terms
and
conditions--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--for
the
secretary
to
observe
the
election.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
you
are
allowed
to
intervene--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--exactly
the
way
he
did
in
this
case?
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
yes,
but
there
is
no...
i
do
not
believe
under
the--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--i
do
not
believe
the
rules
set
down
in
this
case
are
any
different
from
the
rules--
mr.
mark
d.
stern
--under
title
iv?
mr.
mark
d.
stern
i
do
not
believe
the
court
is,
justice
white.
i
believe
the
courts
respect
them,
but
i
do
not
believe
they
are.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
it
hardly
means
anything
because
it
is
the
same
court
that
sets
the
same
terms,
and
if
the
union
refused
to
run
its
own
meeting
under
title
iv
the
court
would
have
done
the
same
thing
that
it
did
here
under
title
iv.
it
would
have
had
somebody
else
run
the
meeting.
there
would
not
have
been
any
other
choice.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
mark
d.
stern
in
published
regulations
and
after
analyzing
the
union's
rules
and
regulations.
if
you
look
at
402(a)(2)(b)...
excuse
me,
402(b)
of
the
statute...
try
once
more,
402(a)(2)
of
the
statute
provides
that
the
order
received
by
the
secretary
is
to
direct
the
conduct
of
an
election
or
hearing
and
vote
upon
the
removal
of
officers
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
title
and
such
rules
and
regulations
as
the
secretary
may
proscribe,
the
first
statutory
misconstruction
that
was
presented
to
you.
the
second
statutory
misconstruction
is
mr.
stern's
statement
that
the
congress
decided
that
where
there
was
a
violation
with
the
statute
in
connection
with
an
election
those
officers
should
be
displaced
and
new
officers
should
be
implaced.
clearly
the
statute
provides
in
402(a)(2)
that
in
the
interim
when
an
election
has
been
challenged
the
affairs
of
the
organization
shall
be
conducted
by
the
officers
elected
and
in
such
other
manner
as
the
constitution
and
bylaws
may
provide.
even
where
the
election
has
been
challenged,
and
remember
there
is
a
presumption
to
the
validity
of
that
election,
but
even
where
it
has
been
challenged
the
officers
elected
most
recently
take
office
and
run
the
union.
that
did
not
happen
here.
for
an
entire
year
we
had
lame
duck
officers
running
the
operation.
a
moment
about
the
way
the
union
proposed
the
stipulations
so-called.
the
union
offered
to
conduct
a
new
election.
now
if
as
mr.
stern
says
there
were
in
fact
massive
violations
here
and
the
union
was
recalcitrant
then
this
court
cannot
accept
his
further
conclusion
that
unions
will
also
take
the
two
and
a
half
years
to
litigate
to
death
any
suit
of
the
secretary
of
labor
because
here
in
fact
once
those
violations
became
obvious
and
once
the
litigation
problems
became
obvious
the
union
here
offered
to
conduct
a
new
election
and
to
grant
the
plaintiffs
exactly
the
type
of
remedy
they
were
looking
for
so
long
as
the
district
court
modified
its
temporary
restraining
order
to
allow
the
union
to
conduct
it
under
its
own
rules.
the
district
court
refused
to
do
that.
thereafter
we
engaged
in
seven
months
worth
of
negotiation
over
a
preliminary
injunction
during
which
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
brennan,
the
union
repeatedly
raised
the
argument
as
to
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
there
are
citations
in
the
briefs.
i
would
also
refer
you
to
joint
appendix
111
and
112,
which
is
the
clearest
statement
with
counsel
for
the
union
saying,
your
honor,
we
don't
agree
to
any
of
this.
regardless
of
who
you
appoint,
we
object
to
your
fundamental
authority
to
appoint
or
to
set
aside
the
results
and
the
court
saying
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
we
appreciate
your
participation
in
these
discussions.
so
it
is
great
misstatement
of
the
record,
and
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
union
did
not
agree
to
the
terms
of
the
election
that
the
court
ordered.
if
we
accept
mr.
stern's
contention
that
the
1983
election
moots
this
case,
then
we
are
left
in
the
anomolous
position
on
the
basis
of
glass
bottle
blowers
that
only
the
secretary
can
fully
litigate
a
title
iv
complaint
and
only
where
he
loses
at
the
district
court
because
if
the
union
loses
at
the
district
court
and
then
is
subsequently
caught
up
in
its
next
regularly
scheduled
election
then
that
suit
may
be
mooted
out
by
the
conduct
of
that
election.
i
suggest
that
is
not
before
the
union
the
due
process
rights
that
is
inferred.
