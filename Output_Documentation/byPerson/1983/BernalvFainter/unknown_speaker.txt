unknown
speaker
do
those
functions
differ
much
from
the
functions
of
notaries
public
generally?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hitchcock,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
notaries
public
in
texas
are
constitutional
officers--
unknown
speaker
--as
opposed
to
statutory
authorization,
such
as
in
griffiths?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
indicate
that
the
state
considers
the
office
more
important?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
all
those
cases
are
consistent?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it's
fair
to
say
the
court's
been
cutting
back
from
what,
a
more
extreme
position
taken
in
griffiths?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
case
can
stand
without
griffiths
in
effect
being
overruled?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
roads?
i
thought
roads
and
bridges
were
a
sovereign
function
now
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
building
of
a
road
is
not
exercising
a
sovereign
power?
unknown
speaker
governments
always
have
to
hire
people
to
do
their
work.
they
even
hire...
the
governor
of
a
state
is
hired
by
the
people,
but
that
doesn't
make
him
any
less
sovereign,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
of
what
significance
is
that?
unknown
speaker
does
the
holder
get
a
special
title,
so
that
you
call
him
mr.
notary
public>
["]
instead
of
mr.
jones>
["]?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
in
your
state
most
lawyers
are
called
"judge",
aren't
they?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
there
are
quite
a
few
more
notaries
today
than
six
per
county,
i
take
it?
the
role
has
changed
somewhat
over
the
years
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
for
instance,
how
many
today
in
the
state
of
texas?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
the
significance
of
the
office
has
been
diluted
somewhat.
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
the
1845
constitution
for
a
minute.
are
we
to
believe
that
that
provision
really
was
enforced,
that
the
notary
was
appointed
by
and
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
on
a
two-thirds
vote?
unknown
speaker
until
1940.
unknown
speaker
that
must
have
been
a
busy
legislature.
unknown
speaker
in
what
ways
do
the
actual
functions
and
authority
of
notaries
in
texas
differ
from
those
in
connecticut?
specifically
hew
would
their
functions
and
authority
differ?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
picked
in
connecticut
because
of
course
that
is
where
griffiths
was
decided.
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
be
closely
reviewed.
unknown
speaker
is
that
special
to
texas?
unknown
speaker
and
that
isn't
true
in
most
states
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
who
else
was
authorized
in
connecticut
that
you
found
in
your
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
suspect
that
everybody
on
this
bench
has
been
a
notary
public
at
one
time
or
another,
and
i
would
suspect
that
their
certificates
read
something
like
this:
that
i,
so
and
so,
governor
of
the
state
of,
imposing
special
trust
and
confidence
in,
do
hereby
appoint
you
a
notary
public.
do
you
think
this
is
less
serious
than
they
take
it
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
recall
from
the
record
here.
must
the
notary
in
texas
put
up
a
bond?
unknown
speaker
that's
true
in
most
of
the
states,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
a
lawyer
can
be
sued
for
malpractice,
too.
i
just
wonder,
are
you
really
asking
us
to
overrule
griffiths?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
notary
has
a
more
significant
function
to
play
in
texas
than
a
lawyer
does?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
fee,
incidentally?
unknown
speaker
50
cents?
unknown
speaker
well,
other
states
are
less
than
that
and
some
are
higher.
unknown
speaker
i
say
other
states
are
less
than
that
and
some
are
higher,
so
that
texas
isn't
very
special
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
do
judges
have
to
be
citizens
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
was--
unknown
speaker
--the
statute
says
they
have
to
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
do
the
lawyers?
do
you
think
federal
judges
in
texas
have
to
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
lawyers
don't
have
to?
unknown
speaker
do
you
consider
your
profession
below
a
notary's?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
the
lawyer
an
officer
of
the
court
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
prosecutor?
does
he
have
to
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
must
a
prosecutor
be
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
hire
assistant
prosecutors
who
are
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
jobs
in
which
you
would
not
be
eligible
for
the
position
if
you
weren't
a
notary.
some
law
offices
like
to
hire
a
secretary
who's
a
notary
or
something
like
that.
so
it
does
affect
job
qualification,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
but
before
you
leave
the
first
point
about
what
the
rational
basis
is,
tell
me
again,
what
is
the
reason
for
it?
why
do
you
want
them
to
be
citizens?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
how
you
got
to
the
rational
basis
standard.
that's
your
first
threshold.
unknown
speaker
once
you
get
there,
why
do
you
have
to
have
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
if
we
answer--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
once
we
get
there
we
would
say,
now,
having
agreed
with
you
on
that,
we
say
now
we've
got
to
find
out
what
the
rational
basis
is.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
say
the
rational
basis
is
that
it's
a
governmental
function.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
suggesting
notaries
form
policy,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
what
is
the
reason
why
they
have
to
be
citizens?
i
still
don't
follow
you.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
it's
a
governmental
function.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
so
important
that
it's
worth
50
cents.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
even
at
that,
a
juror
gets
more
than
50
cents.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
they
get
more
than
50
cents.
unknown
speaker
but
they
get
more
than
50
cents.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
keller,
if
we
go
along
with
you
to
the
point
that
justice
stevens
took
you
and
then
said,
so
why
does
it
have
to
be,
why
is
citizenship
required,
in
cabell
at
that
very
point
the
court
inquired
whether
the
position
in
question
involves
discretionary
decisionmaking
or
execution
of
policy.
now,
tell
me
how
a
texas
notary
performs,
is
involved
in
discretionary
decisionmaking?
unknown
speaker
because
that's
part
of
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
is
that
this
is
wholly
ministerial.
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
that...
when
does
the
notary
get
involved
in
this
function?
unknown
speaker
if
the
notary
disbelieves
somebody,
he
can
get
some
witnesses,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
he
holds...
in
effect,
takes
some
evidence?
unknown
speaker
holds
a...
and
makes
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
else
about
the
notary's
job
that
involves
some
sort
of
discretionary
decisionmaking?
unknown
speaker
suppose
two
or
three
people
come
into
a
notary
and
they
present
a
deed
of
a
conveyance,
and
one
of
the
persons
being
requested
to
sign,
perhaps
the
wife
of
one
of
them,
exhibits
great
reluctance.
does
the
notary
have
an
obligation
in
texas
to
determine
whether
that
is
the
free
act
of
the
person
signing
and
swearing?
unknown
speaker
in
texas
do
they,
as
in
some
states
in
the
past,
are
they
required
to
take
the
oath
of
a
husband
and
a
wife
separately,
out
of
the
presence
of
each
other,
so
that
they
can
determine
whether
the
wife
is
making
the
husband
sign
or
the
husband
is
making
the
wife
sign
against
their
free
will?
unknown
speaker
but
the
notary
must
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
is
acting
of
his
or
her
own
free
will?
unknown
speaker
is
that
aspect
of
the
notary's
duty
different,
do
you
suppose,
than
that
of
other
states,
such
as
connecticut?
unknown
speaker
do
you
cite
in
your
brief
any
cases
in
texas
in
which
a
notary
has
held
anybody
in
contempt
of
court?
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
been
no
case
in
the
last
40
years
on
it?
unknown
speaker
what
does
a
notary
do
when
he
commits,
when
he
finds
somebody
in
contempt?
does
he
call
the
sheriff
to
take
him
to
the
jail,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it?
it
isn't
criminal
contempt,
is
it?
it's
civil,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
just
to
refresh
my
recollection,
what
are
the
qualifications
to
be
a
notary
in
texas,
beside
being
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
consist
of?
unknown
speaker
ma'am?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
present
a
court
record
or
affidavit?
how
do
you
show
you
haven't
committed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
have
any
documentation
from
other
people
or
is
your
certification
accepted?
unknown
speaker
who
appoints
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
secretary
of
state
need
not
be
a
citizen,
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
notary
need
not
know
how
to
read
or
write.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
any
requirement
that
somebody
be
able
to
read
and
write
in
connection
with
an
awful
lot
of
official
positions.
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
for
the
senators
and
congressman
of
the
united
states.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
evidence
of
character
is
the
filling
out
of
a
form
by
the
applicant
himself
or
herself?
unknown
speaker
how
much
is
the
bond?
unknown
speaker
does
an
insurance
company
put
that
up?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
premium?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
term
of
a
notary?
unknown
speaker
four
years.
and
most
of
them
have
other
jobs,
i
assume?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
political
plum
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
political
plum
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question
about
that
contempt
power.
is
that
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
you
cite
that
statute
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
see
it
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
statute
you
did
not
cite
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
there
is
a
statute
that
says
notaries
can
hold
people
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
executed,
exercised
some
40
years
ago?
or
was
that
before
the
statute
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
in
the
notary
law?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
provision
about
contempt
in
connection
with
a
deposition
put
into
the
statute?
that
must
have
been
an
amendment.
unknown
speaker
is
that
true,
the
only
contempt
case
you
can
give
us
is
one
that
was
lost?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
contempt
case
that
you
can
give
us--
unknown
speaker
--it's
so
well
established
it's
never
been
challenged.
