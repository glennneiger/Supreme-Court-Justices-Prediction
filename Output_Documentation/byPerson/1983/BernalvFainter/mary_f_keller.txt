ms.
mary
f.
keller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
resolve
this
case,
there
are
basically
two
inquiries
that
need
to
be
made.
the
first
inquiry
is,
does
the
texas
office
of
notary
public
come
within
the
governmental
function
principle
recognized
in
sugarman
and
refined
in
cabell?
and
if
it
does,
the
second
inquiry
is,
does
the
requirement
of
citizenship
bear
a
rational
relationship
to
legitimate
state
interests?
it
is
certain
that
texas
recognizes
the
office
of
notary
public
as
performing
a
governmental
function.
the
state
of
texas
is
one
of
six
states
to
provide
for
the
office
of
notary
public
in
its
constitution,
beginning
with
the
constitution
of
1845.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
your
honor,
the
significance
is
that
historically
texas
has
considered
the
office
of
notary
public
to
be
a
public
office,
one
that
the
state
gives
high
regard
to.
there
would
be
only
six
per
county.
the
constitution
does
not
name
very
many
public
officers
in
its
constitution
and
this
happens
to
be
one
of
them.
it
is
only
one
of
many
factors
which
lend
credence
to
the
statement--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--i'm
certain
that
a
notary
could
insist
on
it.
it
does
not
appear
in
any
cases
that
i
have
read.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that
is
true,
your
honor.
the
interpretive
commentary
to
the
texas--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--yes,
your
honor,
there
are
quite
a
few
more
notaries.
it's
not
that
the
role--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--i
believe,
reading
petitioner's
brief,
that
there
are
in
excess
of
100,000.
maybe
there
are
300,000
notaries.
and
it's
not
so
much
that
the
role
has
changed,
your
honor;
it's
that
texas
is
becoming--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--there
are
many
more--
[laughter]
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
many
more
significant
officeholders
now
in
texas,
and
it
reflects
to
a
large
extent
the
industrialization
of
texas
and
the
need
for
many
more
public
officeholders
to
do
the
functions
that
the
state
of
texas
has
authorized
the
notary
to
do.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor,
until
1940.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
very
busy
legislature.
[laughter]
but
it
shows...
i
think
what
all
this
shows
is
that
there
is
no
set
job
of
notary
public
across
the
country;
that
in
fact
texas
has
a
special
place
for
its
notary
publics,
notaries
public;
that
it
gives
them
a
great
deal
of
authority;
that
it
puts
it
in
its
constitution;
that
it
gives
them
a
commission
of
the
state,
a
commission
that
requires
that
they
are
acting
by
the
authority
of
the
state
of
texas,
with
the
seal
of
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
your
honor,
i
am
not
completely
familiar
with
the
functions
of
notaries
in
other
states.
i
would
say--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--right.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes.
in
texas
there
are
only
three
offices
which
can
take
acknowledgment
of
written
instruments
for
the
purpose
of
recording.
they
are
the
district
clerk,
the
judge
or
the
county
clerk...
the
county
judge
or
county
clerk,
or
the
notary.
so
to
get
a
written
instrument
recorded
in
texas,
there
are
only
three
officeholders
that
you
can
go
to.
as
part
of
taking--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--your
honor,
i
found
it
to
be
very
unusual,
because,
as
we
all
know,
there
are
deeds
and
mortgages
that
need
to
be
recorded
every
day,
and
to
limit
it
to
three
officeholders
seemed
unusual
to
me.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
as
far
as
i
know
not,
your
honor.
in
looking
at
the
connecticut
statutory
scheme,
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
case
there.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i'm
don't
know,
your
honor.
as
part
of
the
process
of--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--the
only
response
i
can
make
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
texas
takes
it
seriously.
i
don't
know
that
other
states
take
it
less
seriously,
but
texas
takes
its
notaries
public
very
seriously.
i
think
part
of
it
is
it
is
a
border
state.
it
has
a
great
deal
of
influence
coming
from
mexico,
where
the
office
of
notario
publico
is
a
very
important
office,
much
more
analogous
to
attorney.
prior
to
the
texas
constitution
of
1845,
when
it
was
a
republic,
it
made
a
special
statutory
designation
of
notaries
in
1837.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i
believe
it
is
true
in
most
states.
not
only
must
the
notary
put
up
a
bond,
but
texas
statute
requires...
or
allows
a
party
to
sue
a
notary
for
liability
in
the
event
that
the
notary
does
not
perform
his
or
her
function
properly.
so
there
is
a
great
incentive
on
the
part
of
the
notary
to
be
well
versed
in
texas
law
prior
to
taking
on
the
commission
of
the
office
of
notary
public.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
i
don't
think
griffiths
is
controlling
in
any
way
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it's
not
a
question
of
significance
of
the
function.
the
notary
is
clearly
a
public
agent.
an
attorney
is
just
as
clearly
a
private
occupation.
it
has
traditionally
been
a
private
occupation.
the
lawyer
comes
to
the
state
to
provide
a
forum,
but
he
or
she
is
an
advocate,
an
adversary.
the
lawyer
charges
whatever
fee
the
lawyer
thinks
he
or
she
can
get.
the
lawyers
records
are
not
public
records.
in
texas
the
notary's
records
are
public.
in
texas
the
notary
can
only
charge
an
authorized
fee.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
50
cents
per
notarial
act.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
make
a
living
as
a
notary
in
texas.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
pardon
me,
your
honor?
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it's
not
special,
but
the
point
is
i
think
that
the
fee
reflects
the
texas
perception
that
it
be
basically
a
function
that
a
private
individual
performs
on
the
behest
of
the
state,
but
it
is
not
an
occupation.
it
was
not
intended
to
be
an
occupation.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
the
judges
in
texas
are
elected,
your
honor,
and
as
part
of
the
election--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--yes,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
all
the
state
judges
do.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
lawyers
do
not
have
to
be,
your
honor,
absolutely.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
as
i
said,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
question
of
what's
more
important.
it's
a
question
that
the
function
of
the
notary
is
a
state
function,
and
as
such
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
certain
qualifications
for
what
are
sovereign
functions.
the
lawyer
is
not
a
state
actor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
specifically
this
court
in
in
re
griffiths
found
that
under
state
law,
connecticut
state
law,
the
lawyer
was
not
an
officeholder,
was
not
an
official
of
the
state.
and
that
is
a
distinction
with
this
case,
because--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--i
believe
that...
i
don't
know
that.
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there...
certainly
the
lawyer
is
regulated
very
extensively
in
texas,
must...
there
are
canons
of
ethics
that
require
disclosure
to
the
court
in
certain
circumstances.
but
the
state
of
texas
does
not
consider
lawyers
as
officers
of
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
well,
to
the
extent
that
ambach
makes
distinctions
between
public
school
teachers
and
private
school
teachers,
it
may
be
that
a
state
could
designate
certain
attorneys
as
public
officeholders
and
require
that
they
be
citizens.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
oh,
excuse
me.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
no,
your
honor.
but
the
elected
prosecutor,
the
da,
the
elected
prosecutor
would
have
to
be
a
citizen,
because
the
elected
officials
in
texas--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--yes,
your
honor,
he
could.
i
might
also
add
a
distinction
between
griffiths
and
this
case,
and
one
that
the
court
was
justly
concerned
with,
was
that
to
deprive
griffiths
of
the
right
to
practice
law
would
be
to
deprive
her
of
a
livelihood.
this
is
not
the
case
here.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
your
honor,
hypothetically
it
might,
but
the
record
before
this
court
includes
two
plaintiffs,
one
who
became
a
citizen
before
we
got
here
and
the
other
who
is
still
before
the
court.
the
record
established
in
both
of
those
cases
that
the
petitioners
had
no
impact
on
their
ability
to
make
a
livelihood;
that
they
had
continuously
been
hired;
that
being
a
notary
was
not
a
requirement
of
their
job.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
bernal
testified
that
the
reason
he
wanted
to
be
a
notary
is
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
him.
texas
considers
the
notary
to
be
a
governmental
function,
and
in
the
constitution,
historically,
statutorily,
it
has
consistently
treated
it
that
way.
once
the
state
has
defined
the
office
of
notary
public
as
one
of
a
governmental
function,
of
course
this
court
may
still
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
citizenship
is
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest.
the
inquiry
does
not...
this
is
the
harder
part
of
this
case.
and
basically,
there
are
three
parts
in
looking
at
whether
or
not
there
is
a
rational
basis
here:
does
the
notary
perform
functions
that
are
so
essential
to
representative
government
that
it
is
rational
to
require
the
legal
bond
of
citizenship?
that
certainly
would
be
one
way
for
the
state
to
establish
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
require
citizenship.
in
looking
at
the
line
of
court
cases
in
this
area,
that
is
primarily
where
the
attention
has
focused:
is
there
something
about
the
job
itself
that
rationally
requires
citizenship.
my
reading
of
the
cases
indicates
that
the
court
would
entertain
other
legitimate
interests
that
might
be
advanced
by
the
requirement
of
citizenship.
and
finally,
the
court
has
been
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
classification
is
substantially
over
or
under-inclusive,
such
that
the
state's
scheme
is
haphazard
in
some
way.
in
cabell--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--texas
has
given
great
amounts
of
authority
to
its
notaries.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
well,
your
honor,
my
first
threshold--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--my
first
threshold
is
is
it
a
governmental
function.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
and
it's
a
governmental
function
apart
from
its
duties.
it's
a
governmental
function
because
texas
has
recognized
it
as
a
public
office.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
right.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
the
rational
basis
in
ambach
and
cabell
was,
yes,
it's
a
governmental
function;
is
that
function
so
essential
to
government
that
the
legal
bond
of
citizenship
is
required?
that
is
what
the
court
determined
in
ambach,
that's
what
the
court
determined
in
cabell,
that
because
of
the
function
of
the
job,
that
it
was
so
closely
tied
to
the
execution
of
policy
or
the
formation
of
policy,
that
citizenship
was
rationally
required
because
of
the
nature
of
the
job.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
notaries
do
not
form
policy.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
texas
has
given
notaries
a
great
deal
of
authority.
for
instance--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--yes,
and
i'm
going
to
clarify
it
right
now.
in
authorizing
notaries
to
take
acknowledgment
of
written
instruments
for
recording,
the
state
of
texas
has
provided
notaries
with
the
authority
to
administer
oaths,
employ
and
swear
interpreters,
issue
subpoenas,
and
to
punish
for
contempt
if
the
subpoena
is
ignored.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
your
honor,
i
think
the
notary
is
very
similar,
similarly
situated
to
a
juror.
jurors
are
paid--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--well
this
is
just
for
one
little
act.
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
in
the
whole
day
there
would
be
more
to
be
made.
but
jurors
are
not
compensated
nearly
in
relationship
to
their
importance
to
the
governmental
function.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
well,
they
get
ten
dollars
a
whole
day,
i
think,
or
something
like
that.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor,
they
get
more
than
50
cents.
but
they
are
basically...
it's
an
honor
to
be
a
juror,
in
the
same
way
that
it's
an
honor
to
be
a
notary
in
texas.
it
is
not...
notaries
and
jurors
are
not
in
it
for
the
money.
they
are
requested
by
the
state
to
perform
an
important
governmental
job,
and
they
do
so.
they
are
private
citizens
for
the
most
part
and
they
do
so
because
it
is
an
honor
to
do
so.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
all
right,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
in
texas,
as
i
was
saying,
under
state
law,
in
performing
one
of
its
important
functions,
which
is
preparing
documents
for
recordation,
the
notary
has
the
right
to
issue
subpoenas
to
witnesses,
and
if
they
fail
to
come
or
fail
to
answer
properly
the
notary
has
the
right
to
punish
them
for
contempt.
the
punishment
for
contempt
is
a
coercive
authority
of
the
state.
it
is--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--as
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
for
authenticating
documents
to
be
recorded,
there
are--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--there
are
two
ways
to
record
instruments.
one
is
the
person
signing
it
comes
forward
and
has
it
notarized.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
in
the
event
that
it's
already
been
signed
and
the
person
is
deceased,
there
is
a
proof
of
written
instrument.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
right,
your
honor,
absolutely.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
right,
makes
a
judgment
about
whether
or
not
this
is
the
person
who
signed
it,
it's
an
authentic
document.
and
as
part
of
that
authority,
the
notary
has
the
right
to
issue
a
subpoena
to
recalcitrant
witnesses
and,
if
the
witnesses
fail
to
cooperate,
has
the
right
to
hold
them
in
contempt.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
in
taking
affidavits,
the
notary
is
allowed
to...
is
authorized
by
law
to
take
oaths.
in
this
case
the
notary
is
required
to
be
certain
that
whatever
is
being
authorized
or
sworn
to,
that
the
person
understands,
that
it
is
in
fact
the
person.
there
is
a
large...
there
is
nobody
that
the
notary
is
supervised
by.
they
are
in
many
counties
and
there
are
many
of
them,
and
they
are
basically
operating
on
their
own.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
another
area
where
the
notary
exercises
a
great
deal
of
discretion.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
your
honor,
that
had
been
in
the
texas
statutory
scheme,
but
it
has
been
repealed.
it
no
longer
makes
that
kind
of
requirement.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
absolutely
correct.
and
once
the
notary
notarizes
the
document,
it
is
conclusive
that
it
is
what
it
said,
what
it
purports
to
be,
unless
there
is
fraud
proven
in
a
court
of
law.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
the
ability
to
hold
a
person
in
contempt
of
court
is
one
that
i
think
is
unusual
and,
looking
at
some
of
the
publications
of
the
american
association
of
notaries,
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
that
is
a
standard
authority
given
to
notaries.
and
in
my
reading
of
in
re
griffiths,
which
is
the
only
familiarity
i
have
with
the
notary
in
connecticut,
it
is
not
designated
as
one
of
the
authorities
that
the
notaries
there
have.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
we
do
not,
your
honor.
the
most
recent
case
on
this
is
harbison
versus
mcmurray,
163
southwest
second
680.
it
was
decided
in
1942
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
release
somebody
from
a
commitment
by
a
notary.
and
the
court
in
that
case
found
that
it
was
a
verbal
order
and
therefore
was
not
an
effective
commitment,
but
in
so
doing
recognized
the
notary's
authority
to
hold
somebody
in
contempt
of
court.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
there
have
been
no
reported
cases
in
the
last
40
years
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
on
this
issue.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
right.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
well,
i
suppose
it
depends
on...
it's
a
civil
contempt
until
they're
purged.
it
would
not
be
a
criminal
contempt.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
you
must
be
over
the
age
of
18.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
a
resident
of
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
the
secretary
of
state,
in
making
appointments,
has
to
be
convinced
that
there
is
no
good
cause...
that
there
is
good
cause
to
appoint
you.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
basically,
you
cannot
be
appointed
if
you
have
committed
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude?
ms.
mary
f.
keller
you
cannot
be
appointed
if
you
have
committed
a
crime
of
moral
turpitude.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
you
certify
on
your
application
that
there
is
no
reason
under
law
that
you
would
be
excluded.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i
believe
the
certification
is
accepted,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
you're
appointed
by...
now,
since
1940,
you're
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
state.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
the
secretary
of
state
need
not
be
a
citizen.
but
your
honor,
the
secretary--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--the
notary...
the
requirement
to
be
a
notary
does
not
include
that.
however,
your
honor,
it
is
a
bonded
position,
and
by
statute
the
notary
is
liable
for
any
harm
done
as
a
result
of
a
mistake
that
he
or
she
makes.
so
to
the
extent
that
there
is
incentive
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
and
do
your
job
correctly,
there
certainly
is
a
financial
incentive.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
probably...
that
is
certainly
true.
all
the
elected...
all
the
elected
positions
in
texas,
of
course,
that
clearly
is
not
required.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
to
the
extent
the
secretary
of
state
is
not
required
to
be
a
citizen,
i'd
like
to
respond
briefly
to
that.
the
secretary
of
state
is
appointed
by
the
governor
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate,
the
same
way
the
notary
was
previously
appointed,
previous
to
1940.
to
the
extent
that
what
the
state
of
texas
is
interested
in
is
commitment
to
the
state,
accountability,
loyalty,
availability
should
a
question
about
a
notarial
act
arise,
it
is
the
legislature's
determination
that
there
is
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
a
person
of
that
character
will
be
appointed
by
the
governor
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
it's
a
substitute
mechanism
for
guaranteeing
the
qualities
that
texas
wants
in
its
notaries
or
in
its
secretary
of
state.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
$2,500.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i
believe
they're...
it's
a
bonding
company.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
i
don't
know
that,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
four
years.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
oh,
yes.
this
is
very
much
analogous
to
being
a
juror.
it
is
a
periodic
honor
at
the
behest
of
the
state
to
do
a
governmental
function.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
pardon
me,
your
honor?
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
[laughter]
to
the
extent...
but
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
part
of
the
state's
political
community...
and
it
clearly
is,
there
is
no
question
about
that...
this
case
involves
political
rights,
not
economic
rights.
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
deprive
somebody
of
their
basic
existence
in
the
community.
and
when
the
state
confers
political
rights,
the
level
of
scrutiny
is
whether
it
is
rational
or
not.
perhaps
texas
has
given
notaries
more
authority
than
they
should
have,
given
the
level
of
scrutiny
of
application
and
the
level
of
qualifications.
but
that
decision
is
not
before
this
court,
whether
the
legislature
has
wisely
allowed
300,000
notaries
to
find
somebody
in
contempt
of
court.
the
point
is,
texas
has
given
a
great
deal
of
authority
to
its
notaries
traditionally.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that
is
by
statute,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it
is
not
specifically.
it's
part
of
the--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--the
statutory
authority
is
6618.
the
notary
also
has
the
authority
to
hold
someone
in
contempt
in
relationship
to
a
deposition,
and
that
is--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--not
specifically
cited.
it's
part
of
the
whole
scheme
for
what
the
notary
does,
but
that
specific
statute
is
not
cited.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it's
not
before
the
statute
was
passed.
it
was
challenged
some
40
years
ago,
the
last
challenge
to
it.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
presumably
it's
exercised
on
a
daily
basis.
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it's
an
old
statute,
your
honor.
it
is--
ms.
mary
f.
keller
--that's
the
only
challenge
to
it
by
habeas
corpus,
your
honor,
that
i
have
been
able
to
find.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
it's
the
only
reported
case
involving
the
contempt
power
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
f.
keller
that's
right.
thank
you.
