mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
eleven
years
ago
in
the
case
of
in
re
griffiths,
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
state
to
require
united
states
citizenship
as
a
condition
for
being
admitted
to
a
state
bar.
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether,
in
light
of
the
griffiths
decision,
a
state
may
constitutionally
require
citizenship
as
a
condition
for
being
licensed
as
a
notary
public.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
lawful
resident
alien
who
in
1978
applied
to
the
texas
state
authorities
for
a
license
as
a
notary
public,
and
he
desired
to
use
license
in
connection
with
his
job
as
a
paralegal
with
a
legal
aid
organization
in
texas.
the
state
authorities
denied
his
application
solely
on
the
basis
that
he
was
not
a
united
states
citizen
and
therefore
ineligible
under
the
statute
at
issue
before
you.
this
court
has
indicated
that
in
assessing
state
classifications
and
restrictions
involving
aliens,
the
general
standard
of
review
is
strict
scrutiny,
although
there
are
exceptions
in
some
areas.
for
example,
the
court
has
held
that
states
are
able
to
deny
aliens
certain
rights,
such
as
voting
or
running
for
elective
office.
and
especially
pertinent
for
today's
case
is
the
court's
holdings
that
citizenship
may
be
a
relevant
factor
if
the
state
imposes
the
restriction
in
connection
with
certain
appointive
positions
where
the
individual
is
exercising
powers
of
the
state
that
go
to
the
heart
of
representative
self-government.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
in
this
case
is
to
be
judged
under
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
griffiths,
but
even
under
the
more
deferential
standard
applied
for
certain
of
these
appointive
positions
we
are
still
entitled
to
prevail.
let
me
focus
for
a
minute,
if
i
may,
on
the
qualifications
it
takes
to
become
a
notary
public
in
texas
and
also
on
the
nature
of
the
function.
in
order
to
become
a
notary
public
in
the
state
of
texas,
one
must
fill
out
a
one-page
application...
and
mr.
bernal's
application
is
part
of
the
record...
that
gives
one's
name,
address,
and
requires
the
answers
to
four
questions:
are
you
18
years
of
age;
are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
texas;
are
you
a
resident
of
the
county
for
which
you
are
applying;
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude?
there's
a
requirement
of
notifying
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
county
clerk
of
any
changes
of
address.
what's
interesting
is
what
is
not
required.
there
is
no
requirement
that
one
say
one
is
familiar
with
what
a
notary
does
in
texas,
nor,
interestingly
enough,
is
there
a
requirement
that
the
application
be
notarized.
the
functions
of
a
notary
are
relatively
straightforward.
a
notary
in
texas
is
allowed
to
witness
signatures
on
documents,
to
administer
oaths,
take
depositions,
and
authenticate
documents.
and
the
nature
of
the
functions
of
this
office
are
important
because
the
court
has
discussed
these
in
a
number
of
situations
when
the
lesser
standard
of
review
has
been
applied.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no,
they
are
rather
similar
to
the
functions
of
notary
publics.
they
are
similar
to
the
functions
that
mr.
bernal
performed
when
he
was
a
notary
public
in
indiana
four
years,
and
they're
also
identical
to
the
functions
that
are
performed
by
commissioners
of
the
superior
court,
an
office
to
which
lawyers
are
appointed
in
connecticut,
which
was
in
the
griffiths
case.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
in
our
view--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--in
our
view,
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
fact
that
an
office
is
created
in
the
constitution
and
the
fact
that
the
office,
such
as
commissioner
of
the
superior
court,
is
created
by
statute.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
i
would
say
it
indicates
that
the
state
does
consider
the
office
slightly
more
important.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
nature
of
what
the
statute
and
the
constitutional
provision
are
involved
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
texas
constitution
merely
states
that
the
office
is
created,
and
there
is
discretion
that
is
left
to
the
legislature
to
decide
the
qualifications,
the
standards,
what
regulation
should
be
imposed.
interestingly
enough
for
this
case,
the
state's
argument
that
this
is
an
important
position
because
it
is
in
the
state
constitution
really
cuts
both
ways.
it
took
a
century
before,
until
1945
at
least,
that
a
residency
requirement
was
imposed
by
the
texas
legislature,
that
one
be
a
citizen
of
the
state,
an
ambiguous
phrase
at
the
time.
citizenship
of
the
united
states
was
not
required
until
1965.
so
in
that
sense
the
argument
does
cut
both
ways.
one
final
point,
if
i
may.
the
state's
argument
that
this
is
an
important
post
because
it's
in
the
constitution
has
the
problem
with
it
that
what
the
state
is
saying
in
effect
is
that,
we
have
greater
discretion
to
discriminate
provided
we
name
the
post
in
our
state
constitution.
and
we're
not
aware
of
any
authority
that
gives
the
state
that
leeway,
and
there
would
be
the
potential
hazard
that
states
would
seek
to
get
more
deferential
review
by
simply
naming
posts
in
their
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
griffiths
case,
the
office
of
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
was
a
public
office,
it
was
created
by
the
statute.
now,
the
restriction
in
griffiths
on
being
admitted
to
the
state
bar
carried
with
it
the
restriction
on
being
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court,
and
let
me
focus
specifically
on
what
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
does.
despite
the
very
grandiose
name,
the
commissioner
of
the
superior
court
is
essentially
a
notary
public,
and
lawyers
sign
documents,
notarize
documents
in
connecticut
as
commissioners
of
the
superior
court
with
their
own
signature.
they
don't
need
a
seal.
when
one
is
admitted
to
the
connecticut
bar
as
an
attorney,
one
takes
a
second
oath
immediately
after
that
attorney
oath
as
a
commissioner
of
the
superior
court,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
office.
what's
important
about
griffiths
and
important
about
the
restriction
with
respect
to
commissioners
of
the
superior
court
is
that
the
state
of
connecticut
in
griffiths
raised
precisely
the
same
arguments
that
are
being
advanced
here,
that
lawyers
as
commissioners
of
the
superior
court
are
being
entrusted
with
the
actual
performance
of
government
power
and
that
the
state
has
given
meaning
to
the
phrase
that
they
are
officers
of
the
court.
and
this
court
answered
the
question
in
language
which
we
think
is
highly
pertinent
here,
where
the
court
said
that
giving
a
lawyer
the
authority
to
issue
writs
and
subpoenas
or
to
witness
signatures
or
to
administer
oaths
is
not
a
matter
of
state
policy
or
a
matter
of
such
unique
responsibility
that
only
citizens
can
be
entrusted
with
that
responsibility.
in
light
of
the
similarities
between
what
texas
notaries
public
do
and
connecticut
commissioners
of
the
superior
court
do,
we
submit
that
griffiths
is
controlling
and
that
the
statute
should
be
judged
on
constitutional...
under
strict
scrutiny.
the
state
here
has
presented
no
evidence
that
aliens
as
a
class
are
so
untrustworthy,
disloyal
to
the
united
states,
or
incompetent
that
they
must
all
be
excluded
from
performing
this
role,
from
administering
oaths,
from
witnessing
signatures,
and
so
forth.
the
secretary
of
the
state
has
the
power
to
issue
qualifications.
there's
a
bonding
requirement,
a
recordkeeping
requirement,
civil
liability
for
negligence
or
for
intentional
wrongdoing,
and
criminal
liability.
these
are
the
sorts
of
regulations
that
should
assure
proper
performance
regardless
of
citizenship.
if
the
state's
argument
is
accepted
in
this
case,
what
will
happen
is
a
very
curious
anomaly.
under
the
state's
argument,
an
alien
in
the
state
of
texas
can
go
to
law
school,
can
be
admitted
to
the
texas
bar,
can
practice
law,
and
can
draft
a
whole
host
of
legal
documents
that
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
public.
but
that
alien,
that
lawyer,
will
not
be
able
to
notarize
the
documents
that
he
or
she
has
drafted.
we
believe
that
this
anomaly
is
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
standards
of
this
court
and
that
it
should
be
struck
down
under
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
let
me
turn
now,
if
i
may,
to
the
state's
argument
that
a
more
deferential
standard
of
review
is
appropriate
here
because
we're
dealing
with
an
office
involving
execution
or
formulation
of
policy
factors
that
go
to
the
heart
of
representative
self-government.
this
court
indicated
in
sugarman
against
dougall
and
most
recently
in
cabell
versus
chavez-salido
that
there
are
two
standards
that
must
be
met.
first,
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
this
more
deferential
standard,
the
state
must
show
that
the
restriction
is
sufficiently
tailored
to
meet
its
ends,
that
it's
not
over-inclusive
or
under-inclusive;
and
secondly,
that
we
really
are
dealing
with
one
of
these
significant
sovereign
functions
of
the
government.
the
restriction
in
this
case
fails
on
both
counts.
the
restriction
is
over-inclusive
because
it
denies
qualified
resident
aliens
such
as
mr.
bernal,
who
performed
the
functions
of
a
notary
for
four
years
in
indiana,
the
opportunity
to
get
a
commission.
and
it's
also
under-inclusive
because
there's
another
state
office
which
performs
similar
functions,
the
office
of
court
reporter.
court
reporters
are
officers
of
the
state.
they
are
licensed
by
the
state.
there,
i
believe,
is
a
committee
to
deal
with
unauthorized
practice
of
court
reporting.
and
they
certainly
perform
functions
that
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
are
less
important
than
those
that
are
performed
by
notaries
public.
but
however,
these
court
reporters
are
not
required
to
be
citizens.
finally,
there
is
another
anomaly
here,
that
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
texas,
who
actually
is
responsible
for
licensing
notaries,
is
not
required
to
be
a
citizen.
what
the
texas
statutory
scheme
has
done
is
what
was
aptly
described
in
cabell:
the
state
has
indiscriminately
swept
in
a
variety
of
menial
occupations,
while
leaving
out
some
of
the
state's
most
important
political
functions.
turning
now
to
the
second
part
of
the
standard,
the
application
of
the
sugarman
exception
for
sovereign
functions
of
government.
there
are
several
common
themes
that
run
through
the
court's
cases
in
which
this
restriction,
in
which
this
lower
standard,
more
deferential
standard,
has
been
applied.
in
the
first
case,
the
cases
where
the
standard
has
been
applied
involving
policemen,
school
teachers,
deputy
probation
officers,
all
involved
public
employees,
state
municipal
employees,
who
were
on
a
public
payroll.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
i
think
that
if
some
of
the
cases
had
come
out
differently
we
would
have
an
easier
time
in
this
case,
justice
blackmun.
but
your
question
leads
me
to
the
other
common
threads
here.
what
the
court
has
done
is
identified
several
important
functions,
two
important
functions,
law
enforcement
and
education,
and
has
allowed
there
to
be
restrictions
in
deference
because
of
the
importance
of
law
enforcement
and
education
to
the
exercise
of
the
state's
functions.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
the
restrictions
have...
the
last
three
cases
have
applied
a
more
deferential
standard
and
have
upheld
the
restrictions.
our
position
again
is
that
this
case
is
governed
by
strict
scrutiny
and
this
discussion
of
the
more
deferential
standard
comes
in
only
if
the
court
says
that
strict
scrutiny
is
not
applicable
in
this
situation.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
no,
griffiths
would
have
to
be
overruled
in
order
for
the
state
to
prevail
in
this
particular
action.
the
other
thread
that
i
was
referring
to
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
functions
that
go
to
the
sovereign
functions
of
government,
the
exercise
by
the
state
entrusting
individuals
with
the
performance
of
state
functions.
it's
one
thing
to
give
individuals
the
power
to
build
bridges,
such
as
civil
engineers
do
in
flores
de
otero,
but
when
engineers
build
bridges
they're
not
exercising
the
sovereign
function
of
the
state
even
though
they're
licensed
by
the
state.
when
lawyers
draft
contracts,
they
may
be
licensed
to
do
that,
but
they're
not
exercising
sovereign
power.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
well,
they've
always
been
performed...
they
are
public
works,
but
it's
not
exercising
the
sovereign
function
of
the
government
that
goes
to--
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
--not
in
the
sense
that
it
has
been
used
in
the
descriptions,
in
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
decisions
of
the
court.
conceivably,
if
building
a
road
is
regarded
as
a
sovereign
function,
the
people
who
are
building
the
road
might
be
regarded
as
sort
of
employees.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
chief
justice
burger,
the
difference
tends
to
be,
as
the
court
recognized
in
sugarman,
that
there
are
differences
between
the
functions
that
are
performed
by
different
state
employees.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
the
situation
in
which
policemen
are
authorized
to
make
arrests
and
deprive
people
of
their
liberty
in
the
name
of
the
state
and
the
situation
in
which
a
notary
public
is
authorized
to
tell
someone
to
raise
their
right
hand
and
take
an
oath
or
to
witness
a
signature
on
a
document.
that
is
the
distinction
which
is
important,
which
separates
this
case
from
the
cases
where
the
more
deferential
standard
has
been
applied.
finally,
even
if
the
court
should
apply
the
more
deferential
standard
of
review
to
this
restriction
involving
aliens,
we
submit
that
we
are
still
entitled
to
prevail
because
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
this
particular
blanket
exclusion.
the
state
has
presented
no
evidence
that
excluding
all
aliens,
discriminating
against
all
aliens,
rationally
advances
the
legitimate
state
interest
with
respect
to
having
documents
properly
processed
or
the
other
interests
that
have
been
identified
in
this
case.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
point,
we
would
respectfully
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
cornish
f.
hitchcock
mr.
chief
justice:
i
just
want
to
make
one
response
to
a
factual
question
from
justice
powell.
the
bonding
requirement
in
texas
is
$25
in
order
to
become
bonded
as
a
notary
public.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
thank
you
very
much.
