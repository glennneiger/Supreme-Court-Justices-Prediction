unknown
speaker
let
me
back
you
up
a
moment,
mr.
frey.
when
the
device,
the
beeper,
as
you
call
it,
was
placed
in
the
drum,
was
it
placed
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
of
that
drum?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
supposing
you
carried
that
to
a
more
extreme
situation.
supposing
the
government
is
very
anxious
to
monitor
the
movements
of
a
very
suspected
big
criminal
and
they
simply
go
to
the
men's
clothing
store
where
he
shops
and
with
the
agreement
of
the
salesperson
have
a
beeper
put
in
whatever
tie
he
buys.
now,
obviously
that
is
a
more
extreme
situation
than
this,
but
is
the
logic
much
different?
unknown
speaker
not
the
installation.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean,
mr.
frey,
that
it
would
also
be
precisely
the
same
issue
if
after
he
purchased
the
tie
the
government
installed
the
beeper?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
checked
his
coat
in
a
cloakroom
somewhere,
and
they
stuck
the
beeper
in
the
coat
while
it
was
in
the
cloakroom.
would
that
be
precisely
the
same
issue
we
have
today,
or
would
it
be
a
different
one?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
trying
to
isolate
the
issue.
in
your
view,
the
only
issue
is
whether
it
is
okay
to
listen
to
the
beeper.
the
manner
of
installation,
unless
there
is
something--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
they
put
a
microphone
on
the
tie.
that
would
also
not
raise
a
fourth
amendment
question
until
they
listened
to
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
was
the
beeper
actually
put
in
evidence
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
in
this
respect,
mr.
frey,
when
you
say
it
is
really
just
a
substitute
for
the
human
eye,
could
this
can
be
taken
out
of
a
house
and
put
in
a
car
in
a
manner
that
could
not
have
been
visually
detected
from
the
sky
or
from--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
you
would
say
that
we
should
judge
the
case
as
though
this
beeper
had
been
put
in...
a
little
tiny
beeper
had
been
put
into
something
that
could
go
into
somebody's
pocket.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
something
that
somebody
could
put
in
or
take
out
of
a
house
without
your
knowing
it,
without
your
being
able
to
see
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
know
whether
the
can
was
in
the
car
or
not.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
except
by
the
beeper.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
on
this
particular
point,
i
assume
that
considerable
time
was
made
in
preparing
for
this
whole
thing
by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
right?
well,
why
couldn't
they
some
time
in
that
period
of
time
have
gotten
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
couldn't
trust
a
federal
judge?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
i
am
still
a
little
confused
about
the
argument.
now,
to
instal
a
beeper
in
someone's
property
without
consent
as
you
had
here
to
enter
that
property
to
instal
it
does
not
in
your
opinion
give
rise
to
any
fourth
amendment
concerns--
unknown
speaker
--of
need
for
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
an
entry
in
someone's
property
here,
but
you
had
consent
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
think
that
someone
could...
that
you
could
install
with
consent
of
the
storekeeper
a
beeper
in
clothing
that
is
to
be
sold
to
someone
else,
and
that
that
initial
consent
would
suffice
thereafter?
unknown
speaker
well,
knotts
might
get
you
into
the
first...
might
warrant
your
tracking
the--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
first
house,
but
from
there
on--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
he
knows
that
the
can
is
in
that
house.
unknown
speaker
he
knows
validly
or
he
is
entitled
to
know
that
it
is
either
in
the
house
or
close
by.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
he
doesn't
know
that--
unknown
speaker
--any
automobile
that
leaves,
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
can
is
in
it
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey,
let
me
cut
you
off
there
if
i
may.
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
sometimes
a
beeper
is
going
to
be
more
effective
than
visual
surveillance?
that
is
the
whole
point.
unknown
speaker
that
if
you
didn't
have
a
beeper,
they
would
drive
a
lot
of
cars
in
and
out,
and
you
wouldn't
know
which
one
the
can
is
in.
unknown
speaker
and
there
may
be
35
trucks
that
pull
in
and
out
before
you
know
which
one
you
want
to
follow.
unknown
speaker
but
you
know
which
one
to
follow,
which
you
wouldn't
know
visually.
so
you
have
got
to
assume
you
are
doing
something
useful
here.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
reference
a
few
minutes
ago,
mr.
frey,
to
the
fact
that
if
you
put
hundreds
of
agents
on
it,
if
you
had
hundreds
of
agents,
which
in
theory
and
probably
in
practice
you
could
do
if
it
was
a
big
enough
drug
operation,
you
could
follow
every
one
of
the
35
cars
24
hours
a
day.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
get
you
into
the
second
house,
mr.
frey.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
follow
six
trucks
and
they
go
to
different
houses.
you
put
an
agent
outside
of
each
one,
and
using
the
beeper,
you
find
out
that
it
is
in
one
house,
although
you
could
never...
visually
you
could
never
tell
that
it
was
in
that
house,
and
then
you
call
off
all
the
dogs
on
all
the
other
houses
and
you
concentrate
on
that
house.
you
then
know
something
that
is
in
that
house
you
wouldn't
know
without
the
beeper
and
couldn't
have
known.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
don't
you
agree
that
under
knotts,
under
the
theory
of
knotts,
you
could
legally
know
that
the...
at
least
that
the
object
you
were
tracking
had
arrived
at
a
particular
house,
the
first
house?
if
you
could
have
seen
the
object
going
into
the
house,
you
would
know
it
was
there,
and
until
it
left,
you
would
know
it
was
there,
whether
you
had
a
beeper
or
not.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
could
they
have?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
human
error,
though,
isn't
it?
that
was
just
human
error.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you
could
have...
you
possibly
could
have
seen,
if
you
had
been
following
the
right
car
visually,
you
possibly
could
have
seen
the
can
arrive
at
the
first
house,
but
from
there
on
it
is
another
question.
unknown
speaker
let
me
try
a
hypothetical
on
you,
mr.
roberts.
suppose
when
the
ether
company
called
the
police,
the
agents,
and
the
police
went
and
developed,
just
as
they
did
here,
they
arranged
with
the
supplier
of
the
ether
to
have
one
of
the
agents,
an
undercover
agent
be
put
on
the
payroll
of
the
ether
company,
and
then
had
him
go
to
these
purchasers
and
persuade
them,
assume
that
he
persuaded
them
to
take
him
in
as
a
partner
in
this
enterprise,
and
he
would
see
to
it
that
they
got
all
of
the
ether
and
whatever
else
that
they
wanted,
but
meanwhile
he
is
an
undercover
agent.
he
is
in
the
house.
he
is
somewhat
more
animated
than...
he
is
a
very
animated
beeper,
isn't
he?
the
beeper
makes...
transmits
some
sounds,
but
this
fellow
can
transmit
a
good
deal
more.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
that
invasion?
that
is
quite
an
invasion
of
privacy,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
put
a
man
right
in
your
operation.
unknown
speaker
that
potential
for
suspicion
is
certainly
there,
but
that
is
a
human
judgment
to
be
made
by
the
people
in
this
enterprise,
but
now
the
undercover
man
is
in
the
operation
part-time
in
and
out,
and
by
walkie-talkie
and
other
means
he
is
communicating
with
the
agents
all
the
time,
and
he
is
not
suspected.
he
is
in
the
house.
he
is
telling
them
everything
about
their
private
affairs.
unconstitutional?
illegal?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
in
effect
is
a
concealed
beeper
himself?
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
you,
i
wouldn't
operate
on
the
theory
that
there
is
not
an
electronic
device
that
can
tell
when
a
beeper
is
around.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
in
existence
now.
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
i
gather
that
the
information
that
this
type
of
beeper
gave
was
only
a
general
signal
that
described
the
general
vicinity
of
the
beeper,
maybe
inside,
maybe
outside
the
house.
i
take
it
it
was
not
the
kind
of
instrument
that
could
identify
specific
locations
within
the
house
or
whether
the
package
was
opened
or
closed
or
anything
of
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
they
use
it
at
the
final
house
to
identify
where
the
beeper...
that
the
beeper
was
actually
in
that
house?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
beeper.
unknown
speaker
they
were
close
enough.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
is
the
same
as
irving
against
california
in
that
sense,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
that
is
where
police
actually
placed
the
electronic
equipment
in
the
home.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
send
it
in
by
an
inanimate
object
like
the
can
here.
they
sent
people
in
to
attach
these
things.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it
is
the
same
either
way.
unknown
speaker
was
the
tenth
circuit
specific
in
that
regard,
mr.
roberts,
as
to
what
information
they
would
have
found
through
the
beeper
that
they
couldn't
have
found
through
the
hypothetical
agents?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
can
was
lost?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
can
was
lost
in
knotts,
too,
for
a
period
of
time
during
the
trip
from
st.
paul
over
to
wisconsin.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
a
loss
of
six
hours
and
a
loss
of
six
days,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
the
government
is
arguing
that
just
that
kind
of
surveillance
would
form
probable
cause.
i
think
they
figure,
as
i
understand
it,
they
would
have
to
have
an
agent
probably
at
every
one
of
those
400
destinations
to
see
if
there
were
added
reasons
to
support
probable
cause,
because
if
having
the
container
in
your
possession
is
probable
cause
to
search
or
to
arrest,
then
they
could
have
simply
picked
up
the
guy
or
had
a
search
warrant
issued
for
him
when
he
got
the
can
in
the
first
place.
i
think
that
that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
the
amount
of
possible
locations
the
beeper
is
at
would
severely
diminish
any
probable
cause
that
was
attempted
to...
that
they
might
attempt
to
get
later.
but
also
in
the
hypothetical
visual
surveillance
army
type
situation,
it
is
what
i
would
probably
like
to
characterize
as
a
plain
view
possibility
exception,
that
if
an
agent,
a
government
agent
ever
saw
some
item
of
yours,
then
he
could...
in
his
mind
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
he
were
following.
if
he
gained
that
information
later
by
some
illegal
method,
he
could
say,
well,
we
could
have
gotten
it
by
a
legal
method
by
detailing
our
imaginary
surveillance
agent
which
would
follow
that
through
the
years,
months,
or
whatever
it
has
to
be.
i
just
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid
argument.
also,
the
government
argues
that
there
is
a
reduced
expectation
in
these
items.
i
have
found
that
at
note
10
of
their
reply
brief.
and
i
find
that
there
is
a
real
problem
there,
because
i
can't
tell
what
reduced
expectation
they
are
talking
about.
they
allude
to
the
automobile
exception,
but
they
seem
to
be
applying
it
to
persons,
homes,
and
containers.
in
a
way,
what
they
do...
they
seem
to
be
saying
is,
is
because
these
containers
that
travel
along
the
road,
that
they
are
running
the
highway
into
the
home,
and
now
anybody
in
the
home
or
who
has
traveled
along
the
road
or
whatever
has
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy,
so
that
they
could
continue
to
search
once
it
is
within
the
home.
mr.
roberts,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
their
argument.
maybe
i
don't
understand
it
correctly,
but
one
could
say
there
is
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
ten-gallon
can
of
ether,
which
i
don't
suppose
is
going
to
be
kept
in
your
bedroom,
for
example,
because
it
doesn't
smell
too
good.
i
imagine
it
is
normally
going
to
be
found
in
factory
type
locations
and
that
sort
of
thing.
isn't
that
part
of
what
they
are
suggesting?
it
is
a
little
different
than
a
beeper
on
a
necktie,
i
would
think,
at
least
arguably.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
five-gallon
rather
than
ten.
unknown
speaker
it
was
part
of
a
50-gallon
shipment.
unknown
speaker
there
were
ten
of
those
cans,
and
they
could
see
them
in
the
cars
when
they
went
to
the
first
house,
and
they
could
see
them
on
some
of
the
later
movements
until
they
finally
put
them
in
boxes,
and
they
couldn't
tell,
they
couldn't
tell
whether
there
was
a
can,
except
by
the
beeper,
they
didn't
know
that
that
automobile
had
that
particular
can
in
it.
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
all
industrial
uses.
they
are
not...
it
is
not
used
around
the
house
to
make--
unknown
speaker
--pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
how
often
would
a
photographer
use
ten
five-gallon
cans
of
ether?
unknown
speaker
how
long
would
that
supply
last
him?
a
couple
of
years,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
your
record
show
the
total
amount
of
ether
coming
into
albuquerque
or
the
area
in
a
year
or
in
a
month?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
labeled
in
transport,
though,
does
it
not,
because
of
its
volatility?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
precursor
chemical?
i
am
certain
you
have
heard
the
expression
used.
i
wasn't
aware
it
had
a
real
precise
definition.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
something
out
of
which
you
make
illegal
drugs?
unknown
speaker
does
this
record
show
what
kind
of
fabric
the
ether
was
applied
to
to
extract
the
drug?
unknown
speaker
you
said
clothing.
unknown
speaker
men's
suits,
or--
unknown
speaker
--hosiery,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
there
are
several
respondents
in
this
case,
and
at
least
one
of
the
briefs
indicated
that
mr.
muehlenweg
was
acting
as
the
agent
for
respondents
karo,
horton,
and
harley.
i
assume
then
that
there
is
a
question
of
consent
as
to
them.
if
he
was
their
agent
for
the
purchase
of
the
ether,
why
wasn't
he
their
agent
for
purposes
of
consenting
to
the
installation?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
was
their
agent,
at
least
for
purposes
of
mr.
karo,
horton,
and
harley,
why
aren't
they
bound
by
their
agent's
consent?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
brief
made
a
blanket
assertion
that
he
was
their
agent,
so
i
just
wondered
why
that
isn't
that
binding.
and
as
to
the
other
respondents,
they
had
no
property
interest
to
be
protected,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
record
show
what
property
roth,
steele,
and
rhodes
had
that
would
have
been
involved?
unknown
speaker
someone
else's
home?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
qualifies
for
protection,
those
descriptions.
unknown
speaker
these
were
college
students?
unknown
speaker
and
they
all
lived
up
at
taos
for
three
months?
unknown
speaker
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
good
way
up
there.
didn't
they
use
an
alias
for
one
of
the
locker
rentals?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
dollar
figure
on
these
ten
cans
of
ether?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
not
a
college
prank
operation,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
intend
to
reflect
on
your
argument
in
the
slightest.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
is
not
a
small
time
operation.
unknown
speaker
just
one
component
used
over
a
short
period
of
time
is
$3,000,
with
all
the
expensive
precautions
taken
to
cover
it.
that
is
a
highly
organized
enterprise,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
any
worse
than
using
an
alias?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
adverse
result
was
the
fact
that
the
warrant
that
was
obtained
is
void.
unknown
speaker
now,
counsel,
i
take
it
you
are
at
the
point
that
we
should
explore
some
other
areas
carefully.
suppose
you
have
a
terrorist
activity,
something
like
the
one
we
have
read
about
in
london
in
the
last
few
days.
certainly
every
human
being
has
a
right
not
to
be
shot
at
by
the
police.
we
would
all
agree
on
that.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
when
the
person
engages
in
terrorist
activities,
plainly
illegal
activities
on
which
no
one
would
disagree,
that
he
has
given
up
his
right
not
to
be
shot
at
by
the
police?
he
has
given
up
his
otherwise
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights.
unknown
speaker
but
some
of
these
terrorist
things
that
we
read
about,
individual
cases,
there
is
only
one
person
in
the
house,
and
he
goes
from
window
to
window
shooting
people
and
killing
them,
a
number
of
them,
one
in
the
morning
paper,
no
problem
about
identifying
the
wrongdoer
there,
nor
is
the
nature
of
his...
the
gravity
of
his
wrongdoing.
do
you
think
he
has
given
up
some
of
his
constitutional
rights
not
to
be
shot
at?
unknown
speaker
why
wasn't
it
used
to
get
the
search
warrant
in
the
final
house?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
in
your
view,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it
went
in
the
house
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
lynchpin
of
your
argument
is,
there
is
no
search
no
matter
where
it
goes.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
one
of
your
arguments.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record.
when
they
put
the
cans
in
the
box.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
will
find
that
somewhere,
56,
57,
58,
you
will
find
that
a
truck
departed
with
some
boxes,
and
they
didn't
see
any
cans,
but
the
beeper
told
them
that
the
boxes
had
the
cans
in
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
record
will
speak
for
itself.
