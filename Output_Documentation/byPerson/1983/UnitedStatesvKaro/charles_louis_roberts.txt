mr.
charles
louis
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
oral
argument
in
this
court's
prior
beeper
case
of
united
states
versus
knotts,
justice
o'connor
asked
alexander
frey
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
whether
a
beeper
which
pinpointed
an
object
in
a
barrel
inside
the
premises
was
a
search.
he
said
at
that
time
that
that
was
a
different
case
and
a
lot
stronger
case
for
it
being
a
search.
justice
o'connor
then
pursued
her
line
of
questioning
to
ask
if
the
beeper
pinpointed
an
object
within
the
bedroom
of
a
house,
would
that
be
a
search.
mr.
frey
said
yes.
he
didn't
say
yes.
he
said,
that
could
be
a
search.
and
that
is
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
today.
in
knotts,
the
government
took
pains
to
point
out
and
this
court
took
equal
care
to
note
that
this
was
a
very
limited
use
of
the
beeper
that
they
were
using
in
knotts.
it
was
not
a
24-hour
surveillance
of
any
citizen.
it
did
not
go
into
any
protected
area,
into
any
home.
that
does
not--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--unless
the
installation
was
unlawful.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
if
the
installation
was
lawful,
you
could
see
it.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
case
in
this
particular
instance.
i
have
looked
at
the
record
just
briefly
on
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
if
one
looks
at
that,
it
doesn't
say
whether
they
saw
the
cans
being
taken
inside.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
it
is
perhaps
possible,
perhaps
possible
not,
because
they
seem
to
be
following
a
car
which
they
find
out
later
did
not
have
the
cans
in
it,
and
then
later
discover--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--yes.
beepers
don't
make
those
kind
of
errors.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
but
i
think
that
even
as...
like
i
said,
the
record
here,
we
are
not...
it
is
not
clear
whether
they
saw
it
arrive
at
the
first
house.
they
saw
it
park
in
front
and
then
leave,
and
then
they
are
following
the
car,
and
later
with
the
beeper
say,
they
must
have
taken
it
off,
and
it
is
at
this
address.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
and
in
fact--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--that
is
true,
but
as
mr.
frey
said
in
the
oral
argument
in
knotts,
one
can
suspect
a
disloyal
agent
or
a
disloyal
friend,
and
one
is
held
to
suspect
that,
but
one
does
not
suspect
a
disloyal
can
or
a
disloyal
wristwatch
or
whatever.
there
is
just
no
knowledge.
if
one
exposes
his
activities
to
an
undercover
agent,
he
does
so
willingly.
none
of
these
respondents--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--no,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
cases
say
that
if
anybody
invites
any
person
into
one's
house,
that
that
is
legal.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
just
the
fact
that
there
is
no...
that
there
just
really
isn't
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
i
think
the
government
will
admit
this,
or
did
it
in
knotts,
that
one
would
think
that
every
object
that
one
has
is
working
for
the
government.
at
least
that
expectation
doesn't
exist
now
in
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
it
may
later.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
there
perhaps
could
be
those
devices
one
day
and
whatever.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
but
in
briefly
stating
the
position
of
the
respondents--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--justice
o'connor,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
the
capabilities
of
the
beeper
was
not
discussed
at
any
point.
we
don't
know
whether
they
could
have
or
could
not
have
by
using
two
monitors
and
triangulating,
whatever.
we
don't
know.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
they,
at
that
particular
moment
when
they
want
the
search
warrant,
they
get
very
specific.
it
is
at
that
house.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
because
of
the
beeper.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
the
government
in
this
case
went
under
the
policy
of
united
states
attorney's
office
in
the
district
of
new
mexico
to
obtain
a
judicial
warrant.
the
government
in
this
case
treated
this
as
a
search.
they
went
and
got
a
warrant,
and
if
they
had
not
lied
in
the
warrant,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
today,
but
instead
of
being
embarrassed,
they
are
here
asking
for
a
new
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment.
in
trying
to
avoid
the
fourth,
they
make
four
basic
arguments.
first,
that
beeper
transmissions,
even
within
protected
areas,
are
not
searches.
secondly,
that
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy,
that
there
is
somehow
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
in
containers
and
areas
they
enter.
third,
that
a
new
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
should
be
created
that
would
require
only
reasonable
suspicion.
and
fourth,
that
even
if
probable
cause
is
required,
a
warrant
should
not
be
required.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
fact
that
it
is
not
a
search,
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
distinguish
between
limited
capability
and
limited
information,
and
limited
intrusiveness
and
limited
information.
they
actually
put
a
government
device
inside
your
container.
they
actually
put
a
government
device
inside
your
home.
the
intrusion
is
serious.
now,
the
information
that
that
beeper
can
convey
is
limited,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
irving,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
by
surreptitious
methods?
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
that
way,
but--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--yes.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
and
i
don't
think
that
anything
has
turned...
any
search
has
turned
on
the
limited
information
gathered.
in
other
words,
if
we
send
a
deaf
and
blind
constable
in
to
search,
i
believe
the
fourth
amendment
fully
applies,
even
though
he
is
capable
of
learning
very
little.
the
limited
information
is
what
they
really
have,
not
limited
intrusiveness.
and
there
is
also
the
limited
capability,
which
i
said
is
not
in
the
record.
the
tenth
circuit
found
that
beeper
transmissions
did
give
law
enforcement
information
that
they
never
would
have
gotten
even
if
they
had
had
that
hypothetical
army
of
surveillance
agents
they
continue
to
refer
to.
it
also
has
all
of
the
earmarks
of--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--i
don't
believe
that
they
were
specific
and
except
the
fact
that
they
said
that
several
times
that
the
beeper
was
lost
and
would
never
have
been
found
again
save
for
the
beeper.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
the
can
was
lost
four
or
five
times,
and
when
the
can
is
lost
and
they
are
going
all
over
the
city
of
albuquerque,
and
as
this
court
must
realize,
this
invades
five
or
six
homes,
depending
on
how
someone
looks
at
it,
for
over
five
months.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
think
that
was
a
momentary
loss,
and
there
were
attempts
to
make
visual
surveillance
at
the
same
time.
in
this
case,
it
was
lost
for
days.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
think
constitutionally
that
when
you
get
into
that
large
of
loss,
you
are
absolutely
relying
on
the
beeper.
the
government
could
plausibly
argue
that
if
we
had
gone
a
little
faster
down
the
road,
we
would
have
found
the
same
things
and
seen
the
same,
and
that
it
may
be
just
helping
us
a
little
bit.
in
this
case,
an
agent
standing
there
knowing
that
the
beeper
isn't
where
he
saw
it
was
last
looks
over
the
city
of
albuquerque
and
he
is
not...
his
senses
aren't
being
enhanced
by
the
beeper.
he
has
no
idea.
his
senses
tell
him
nothing.
the
beeper
tells
him
exactly
where
it
is.
but
also
in
dealing
with
the
issue
that
agents
could
have
seen
all
of
these
things
as
one
has
already
been
pointed
out
today,
there
is
a
possibility
of
vehicles
leaving
places,
leaving
places,
leaving
places.
even
with
an
infinite
army
of
agents
out
there
surveilling,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
it
could
be
missed,
and
secondly,
there
is
a
situation
of
where
there
wouldn't
be
probable
cause
at
the
end
of
it.
you
would
have
400
possible
locations
of
the
beeper,
and
you
would
have
to
say
to
a
judge
there
is
a
100
in
400
chance
that
it
is
in
this
place.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
equates
with
probable
cause,
so
the
beeper--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--it
is
only
a
five-gallon
drum
of
ether--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--justice
stevens,
and
this
can
be--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--carried
in
a
truck
of
a
car
or
put
in
a
locker
or
put
in
the
garage
or
whatever.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
and
also
we
presented
evidence
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
ether
is
a
very
common
chemical.
it
is
a
chemical
that
is
used
in
varying
amounts
as
a
solvent,
to
synthesize
hormones,
to
make
vitamins,
perfumes,
silicone,
oils,
preparation
of
high
quality
film.
in
fact
the
professor
that
we
called
to
testify
testified
that
50
gallons
was
not
a
large
amount
for
a
small
manufacturing
or
a
small
perfume--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--it
is
used
in
photography,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
it
is
used
in
photography,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
think
not
very
often.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
don't
think
it
would
be
very
often,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--no,
but
the
professor
in
question
said
just
simply
for
his
classes
and
the
various
things
they
did
at
school
they
often
ordered
it
by
the
tank
car,
which
is
a
substantial
amount
more
than
50
gallons.
as
a
solvent,
things
come,
you
know,
in
large
quantities,
but
it
is
not
illegal
to
own
ether.
it
is
not
contraband.
it
is
not
even
a
precursor
chemical.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
because
of
its
flammability,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
does.
but
it
is
not
a
precursor
chemical.
it
is
not--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--yes,
it
is...
a
precursor
chemical
is
something
out
of
which
a
contraband
substance
can
be
made,
like
methamphetamines
or
whatever.
they
are
listed...
some
of
them
are
prohibited
even
from
private
people
or
persons
to
own.
ether
is
not
one
of
those.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
no.
it
probably
could
be
used
in
a
million
illegal
or
legal
ways
when
you
are
using
it
as
a
solvent.
in
this
case,
it
was
used
to
wash
cocaine
out
of
clothing
that
had
been
imported
into
the
united
states.
in
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
new
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment,
the
government
doesn't
really
seem
to
give
us
a
basis
for
saying
why
there
should
be
a
new
exception
except
that
there
are
so
many
exceptions
and
perhaps
we
should
have
another.
it
does
not
fit
in
any
category
that
the
government
sets
forth.
it
is
not
an
investigatory
stop.
it
is
not
a
border
search.
it
is
not
an
automobile
search.
and
it
has
several
problems
with
it
that
don't
fit
in
those
kind
of
cases
that
cause
it
not
to
fit.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
time
limitation.
the
beeper
can
be
extended
and
stay
there
for
ever
and
ever.
it
is
not
brief,
like
in
place
having
a
dog
sniff
you
for
a
certain
amount
of
time.
this
dog,
if
you
can
compare
it
to
a
dog,
is
inside
the
can,
and
is
sniffing
all
the
time,
for
five
months.
also,
there
is
no
exigent
circumstances.
every
one
of
these
other
cases
talk
about
the
fact
that
someone
needs
a
warrant
but
can't
get
one
because
of
some
problem,
or
that
there
is
some
immediate
need
to
get
a
warrant
and
they
can't
get
it,
and
so
the
exigent
circumstances
allows
them
to
go
without
a
warrant
on
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
it
was--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--clothing,
is
all
that
appears.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
in
other
words,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--no,
i
think
that
this
was
heavier
clothing.
it
was
a
scheme
of
some
local
young
men
in
albuquerque,
some
college
students
or
whatever,
to
import
some
clothing
from
colombia
that
was
saturated
in
cocaine,
and
to
wash
it
out
and
to
sell
it,
and
that
was
simply
what
happened.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
believe
that
one
could
make
the
point
that
he
could
consent
to
the
installation
but
he
cannot
consent
to
the
beeper
remaining
inside
the
drum
when
he
hands
it
over
to
other
people.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
would
just
have
to
answer,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
one
bought
a
house
from
somebody
else,
somebody
could
not
leave
a
bug
in
it,
even
if
that
person
was
one's
real
estate
agent.
i
don't
believe
that
one
person
can
consent
to
the
future
violations
of
over
five
months
of
all
sorts
of
individuals.
and
i
just
don't
believe
he
had
that
power.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
at
that
time,
until
the
beeper
intruded
upon
their
private
areas.
now,
i
still
would
make
the
point
that--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may
approach
them,
roth
was
in
the
taos
house.
he
had
been
there
for
seven
or
eight
days,
which
the
beeper
was
used
to
find
that
house.
that
appears
on
page
57
and
58
of
the
record.
he
was
sick.
he
had
come
up
to
ski,
and
had
stayed
there
several
days,
and
had
his
own
bedroom.
rhodes,
there
is
a
question
of
whether
it
entered
his
house
on
madison
street.
furthermore,
he
had
the
access
to
one
of
the
storage
lockers
with
a
key
where
the
beeper
was
monitored
inside,
and
third,
he
was
at
the
taos
home
one
night
while
the
beeper
was
being
monitored,
and
then
left.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
but
he
was
a
guest.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
well,
an
overnight
guest
i
believe
does
have
some
protection,
but
horton
and
harley
have
probably...
they
have
an
interest
in
the
drum
itself.
it
goes
into
their
houses
and
their
families'
houses.
they
are
the
ones
who
rent
the
lockers
that
it
goes
into.
and
they
are
the
ones
who
along
with
steele
rent
the
meadowwind
taos
residence
where
they
lived
for
three
months
before
the
arrival
of
the
ether
and
the
start
of
the
search.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
a
few
of
them
were.
there
was
even
a
medical
chemistry
student
who
was--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--three
of
them
did.
albuquerque...
taos
being
a
little
to
the
north
of
albuquerque.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes,
there
was
an
alias
on
that
rental.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
it
cost
$3,000
to
buy
them.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
wasn't
mentioning...
it
is
a
serious
offense,
chief
justice
burger.
i
was
just
trying
to
explain--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--it
took
$3,000.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
i
believe
it
was
organized.
there
were
leaks,
because
that
is
why
muehlenweg
got
in,
and
whatever,
and
like
that,
but
also
there
is
one
point
that
i
have
forgotten
to
raise
here
as
to
why
it
is
a
search,
and
that
simply
is
that
it
does
everything
a
police
search
would
do.
if
a
police
wants
to
find
an
item
in
your
home,
he
goes
in
and
finds
it.
the
beeper
tells
him
it
is
in
your
home,
the
exact
same
information.
in
fact,
in
some
cases
the
beeper
probably
tells
more
than
a
policeman
inside
the
drum,
because
if
a
policeman
was
inside
the
drum
and
got
out
in
one
of
these
storage
lockers,
he
wouldn't
know
anything
except
he
was
in
a
storage
locker
somewhere,
but
the
beeper
can
tell
the
agents
outside
where
it
is,
and
it
tells
them
that.
it
searches
for
the
can
of
ether,
finds
it,
identifies
it,
and
then
follows
it.
in
a
brief
comment
on
the
supervisory
powers,
i
would
simply
point
out
that
this
is
a
case
where
a
u.s.
attorney
and
a
dea
agent
purposely
lied
to
get
this
warrant.
if
there
is
any
indication...
to
a
district
judge.
if
there
is
any--
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
--your
honor,
they
were
probably
no
worse
than
what
the
defendants
did,
that
is
for
sure,
but
there
are
sanctions
to
be
applied
against
defendants
and
there
are,
of
course,
sanctions
to
be
applied
against
these
individuals.
none
of
these
individuals
to
my
knowledge
has
been
disciplined.
the
u.s.
attorney
left
to
run
for
office
after
two
and
a
half
years
of
practice.
there
was
no
action
taken
except
the
suppression.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
that
is
one
adverse
result.
but
if
the
evidence
is
not
suppressed,
it
surely
is
not
going
to
harm
the
government
that
much.
also,
i
would
point
out
in
a
few
seconds
here
that
a
dead
beeper
is
still
an
intrusion.
if
a
police
officer
comes
into
your
house
blindfolded,
and
with
things
over
his
ears,
ready
at
any
moment
to
go
into
action,
that
is
an
intrusion.
if
they
put
a
beeper
in
your
house
or
they
put
a
beeper
in
your
vehicle
or
they
put
a
beeper
in
a
container
where
you
have
an
expectation
of
privacy...
excuse
me
for
adding
vehicle...
it
would
seem
that
that
is
an
intrusion.
it
is
a
chilling
factor
to
know
that
the
government
just
on
its
own
discretion
can
place
beepers
anywhere
and
activate
them
at
the
turn
of
a
switch,
to
follow
any
object,
any
vehicle,
any
thing,
and
as
militarization
increases,
they
can
probably
do
it.
the
one
you
saw
today
may
be
the
size
of
a
pencil
tomorrow,
and
down
to
this
level
indicating
the
next
day,
and
this
court
really
needs
to
consider
about
allowing
that
sort
of
surveillance
without
any
judicial
information
protection
which
would
be
afforded
by
a
fourth
amendment
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirement.
the
congress
won't
know
how
many
times
this
is
happening.
the
government
will
know.
the
courts
will
not
know.
only
a
few
guilty
criminal
defendants
will
be
able
to
even
challenge
the
fact
that
they
have
been
followed
and
monitored,
because
they
will
probably
the
only
ones
who
will
ever
know,
and
in
some
cases
they
might
not
even
know.
it
may
not
be
reasonable
to
disclose
it.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
yes.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
he
may
have
given
up
some
rights,
chief
justice,
but
i
think
this
court
in
mincey
said
that
even
a
homicide
doesn't
forfeit
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
very
home
where
the
policeman
was
shot
in
a
heroine
deal,
and
that
is
the
finding
of
that
court,
that
you
cannot
already
assume
that
the
man
is
guilty
before
you
have
even
gathered
the
evidence,
and
that
was
a
specific
holding
of
this
court
in
mincey,
and
i
believe
that
should
be
the
holding.
mr.
charles
louis
roberts
because
of
exigent
circumstances,
your
honor,
i
think
a
lesser
standard
would
follow.
