mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
gives
the
court
the
opportunity
to
revisit
some
issues
that
it
considered
last
year
in
connection
with
the
use
of
a
very
important
law
enforcement
technique,
the
beeper.
now,
the
case
began
when
dea
agents
investigating
drug
manufacturing
activities
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico,
through
a
course
of
investigation
discovered
that
a
gentleman
named
carl
muehlenweg
was
acting
as
a
front
to
acquire
chemicals
for
certain
illicit
drug
manufacturing
operations,
and
they
searched
muehlenweg's
premises,
and
muehlenweg
agreed
to
cooperate
with
them
in
further
investigations.
and
some
time
thereafter
he
advised
them
that
certain
individuals
had
through
him
placed
an
order
for
50
gallons
of
ether
to
be
used
in
the
process
of
extracting
cocaine
from
clothing.
the
agents
with
the
consent
of
mr.
muehlenweg
and
pursuant
to
a
court
order
which
was
later
held
to
be
invalid
secreted
in
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
containers
or
actually
manufactured
a
duplicate
container
of
ether
and
secreted
a
beeper,
transmitter
in
the
bottom
of
the
container.
this
was
picked
up
by
respondent
karo,
who
was
followed
by
visual
and
beeper
surveillance
to
his
house.
later
that
day
the
signal
was
no
longer
coming
from
the
area
of
karo's
house,
but
the
container
or
the
beeper
signal,
at
least,
was
located
at
respondent
horton's
house,
and
the
agents
identified
the
general
vicinity
with
the
beeper
and
then
walked
by
the
outside
of
horton's
house
and
were
able
to
smell
the
ether
emanating
from
somewhere
on
the
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
placed
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
at
that
time,
although
of
course
it
was
known
that
it
was
going
to
be
delivered
to
other
persons
in
the
future,
but
at
the
time
there
was
consent.
in
any
event,
whether
or
not
there
was
consent
i
don't
think
would
be
material
here,
because
the
invasion
of
the
drum
at
that
time
did
not
invade
any
property
interest
or
any
privacy
interest
of
any
of
the
respondents,
at
that
time.
but
there
was
in
fact
consent.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
think
the
logic
would
be
much
different.
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
suggest
that
there
was
any
fourth
amendment
violation
in
the
installation
by
itself.
it
was
only
the
subsequent
delivery
of
the
container
that
contained
the
transmitter,
which
in
their
view
gave
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
in
our
view,
it
is
the
monitoring
of
that
transmitter
that
gives
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
issue,
and
not
the
mere
silent
presence
of
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
see
how
without
the
monitoring
you
have
either
a
search
or
a
seizure
that
is
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment.
you
acquire
no
information
from
merely
installing
a
dead
or
silent
beeper.
it
is
of
no
value
to
you
whatsoever.
so,
in
fact,
suppose
that
the
men's
clothing
store
on
its
own
had
sewn
this
in
their
customer's
tie
and
then
had
called
up
the
fbi
and
said,
we
put
a
beeper
in
the
tie.
he
has
come
and
picked
it
up.
if
you
want
to
follow
him
around,
use
the
beeper.
please
feel
free.
in
my
view,
that
would
pose
exactly
the
same
fourth
amendment
question,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
it's
the
installation,
even
though
that
would
have
been
a
private
installation
of
the
beeper.
i
think
it's
the
monitoring
which
may
or
may
not
constitute
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
might
be
necessary
at
that
point
for
them
to
seize
his
property
or
search
his
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
be
essentially
the
same
issue.
that
is
our
principal
reliance
on
this
point
about
the
installation.
it
is
not
that
there
was
consent
to
the
original
installation,
because
that
only,
that
addresses
the
question
whether
the
original
installation
was
itself
a
search
or
a
seizure.
if
we
wanted
to
install
a
transponder
in
somebody's
aircraft
and
we
had
to
open
the
door
of
the
aircraft,
climb
in,
and
fiddle
around
with
the
radio
equipment,
that
would
be
a
search
of
the
interior
of
the
aircraft
which
would
be
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment.
if
we
had
consent,
it
would
be
a
valid
search.
but
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
whether
we
acquire
information
or
seize
property
at
some
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
see
how
the...
unless
the
installation
is
itself
a
search
or
seizure
that
might
violate
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
individual,
then
i
fail
to
understand--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--not
until
they
listened
to
it.
not
if
they
didn't
listen
to
it.
nothing
would
be
a
fruit
of
that
action.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
suppressing
evidence
here.
there
has
to
be
a
fruit.
there
can
only
be
a
fruit
of
this
kind
of
technology
if
you
listen
to
it
or
take
advantage
of
the
signal.
so
i
don't...
i
see
that
issue
as
a
red
herring
and
not
the
real
problem
of
substance,
if
there
is
one
in
this
case.
i
wanted
to
just
follow
the
course
of
the
investigation
a
little
further,
because
i
think
it
is
typical
of
these
drug
manufacturing
cases
and
useful
for
the
court
to
appreciate
it.
after
it
was
at
horton's
house,
which
was
the
second
premises,
it
was
then...
a
couple
of
days
later
they
walked
by.
they
no
longer
smelled
ether.
they
then
used
the
beeper
to
determine
that
it
had
been
moved
at
or
near
the
premises
of
horton's
father,
and
later
that
day
the
signal
was
no
longer
coming
from
that
vicinity,
and
the
beeper
was
then
traced
to
a
set
of
storage
lockers
in
albuquerque,
which
i
gather
are
walk-in
type
storage
lockers
that
people
can
rent
for
long
periods
of
time.
the
particular
locker
in
which
the
ether
was
located
was
identified
by
smell
by
the
agents
walking
and
then
by
a
conversation
with
the
manager
of
the
storage
locker
which
ascertained
that
horton
and
perhaps
harley
had...
were
the
renters
of
this
particular
locker.
the
agents
then
obtained
a
court
order
to
install
an
entry
tone
alarm
in
the
door
of
this
locker
which
would
warn
them
when
the
door
of
the
locker
was
opened,
and
they
did
install
such
an
alarm,
but
it
malfunctioned,
and
about
a
week
later
they
got
a
call
from
the
manager
of
the
storage
lockers
who
said,
by
the
way,
these
fellows
have
taken
the
stuff
out
of
the
storage
locker.
so
again
using
the
beeper,
they
tracked
the
container
to
another
group
of
storage
lockers,
again
identified
the
particular
locker
by
smell
and
by
interviewing
the
manager
of
the
locker.
this
time
they
placed...
they
rented
a
locker
which
i
guess
was
opposite
from
the
one
that
the
respondents
were
using
and
put
a
tv
monitor
on
there
focused
on
the
door
of
the
storage
locker
containing
the
ether,
and
the
ether
sat
there
for
about
three
and
a
half
months
at
this
point,
and
then
respondent
rhodes,
who
is
the
only
one
of
the
defendants
not
to
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals,
arrived
at
the
locker
in
horton's
pickup
truck,
emptied
out
the
contents
of
the
locker,
drove
to
the
vicinity
of
his
residence,
picked
up
some
other
things,
and
then
went
to
taos,
new
mexico,
which
i
think
is
about
150
miles
away,
followed
by
visual
and
beeper
surveillance,
to
the
ultimate
destination.
the
agents
then
surveilled
this
destination.
in
this
case
they
used
the
beeper
in
the
course
of
their
surveillance
actually
to
determine
that
the
containers
were
inside
the
residence
in
taos,
and
during
their
surveillance
they
saw
at
one
point
that
all
the
windows
were
open,
although
it
was
a
very
cold
and
windy
day,
and
they
knew
from
that
that
the
ether
was
actually
being
put
to
use.
they
then
procured
a
conventional
search
warrant
from
the
district
court,
executed
a
search,
and
seized
cocaine,
marijuana,
laboratory
equipment,
and
other
items.
now,
the
district
court
found
that
the
original
order
that
had
been
sought
to
authorize
the
beeper
surveillance
was
invalid
because
it
had
falsely
represented
that
muehlenweg,
the
informant,
was
a
target
of
the
investigation,
and
that
without
the
false
representations,
the
warrant
failed
to
show
probable
cause,
and
the
court
held
that
probable
cause
and
a
warrant
is
required
for
the
use
of
beeper
surveillance.
the
government
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
we
did
not
challenge
the
ruling
on
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
but
rather
we
took
the
position
which
we
take
today
that
no
warrant
is
necessary
for
the
use
of
this
particular
kind
of
beeper
surveillance.
the
court
of
appeals
generally
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
and
it
found
both
that
the
installation
and
delivery
of
the
beeper
container
itself
violated
the
rights
of
the
transferee
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
searches
without
a
warrant,
and
that
the
monitoring
of
the
signals
emitted
by
the
beeper
is
itself
a
search
if
it
happens
at
the
time
of
the
monitoring
that
the
beeper-laden
container
has
been
taken
into
private
premises
that
would
not
be
subject
to
a
conventional
search
without
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause.
now,
i
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
about
what
beepers
are
and
their
utility
in
law
enforcement,
and
i
thought
for
the...
i
know
the
court
was
very
curious
during
the
knotts
argument,
so
i
had
the
da
supply
me
with
a
beeper
just
so
that
you
can
see
what
it
looks
like.
it
is...
i
understand
that
it
is
installed...
these
are
batteries.
this
is
the
transmitter.
and
it
is
packed
in
styrofoam
in
this
way
and
put
in
the
false
bottom
of
a
container,
as
in
this
case.
this
is
not
the
beeper
that
was
used
in
this
case,
but
it
is
similar.
it
is
actually
a
little
smaller,
i
am
told,
than
the
one
used
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
that
it
was,
and
i
don't
rely
on
any
conclusions.
it
is
just
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
that
i
thought
the
court
exhibited
during
the
knotts
argument.
all
right.
this
is
an
fm
radio
transmitter.
it
emits
a
signal
that
allows
the
beeper
to
be
located
by
the
use
of
appropriately
designed
receiving
equipment.
now,
this
equipment
cannot
pinpoint
very
precisely
the
location
of
the
signal
coming
from
the
beeper
unless
you
get
quite
close.
there
are
basically
two
kinds
of
uses
for
beepers.
one
is
attaching
them
to
vehicles
to
follow
the
vehicles,
aircraft,
or
so
on,
on
the
highway,
and
the
second
is
implanting
them
in
containers,
as
in
this
case,
as
in
the
knotts
case.
there
it
is
usually
done
in
drug
investigations,
but
it
could
be
used
with
explosives
or
containers
of
firearms
that
are
suspected
to
be
exported
or
other
kinds
of
containers
that
would
not
be
likely
to
be
opened
and
have
the
beeper
revealed
prematurely.
the
essential
purpose
of
the
beeper
is
to
facilitate
the
process
of
surveillance
of
the
movement
of
cars,
chemicals,
or
other
containers
that
are
suspected
to
be
involved
in
illicit
activities.
basically
it
is
a
substitute
for
the
human
eye
in
following
these
movements,
but
it
is
tremendously
valuable
both
in
enabling
a
surveillance
to
be
conducted
effectively
with
limited
personnel
resources
and
in
generally
reducing
the
danger
that
the
surveillance
will
be
detected
by
the
suspects.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suspect
it
could,
and
i
do
plan
to
get
to
that
when
i
talk
about
the
question
of
whether
this
case
is
like
or
unlike
knotts,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not
sure
that
you
should
do
that,
although
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
conceptual
analysis
i
probably
would
say
that,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
five-gallon
container
of
ether
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
do
that.
we
would
be
able
to
see
that
they
were
leaving
the
house.
we
might
not
be
able
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
will--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
could
have,
and
they
did,
and
the
warrant
happened
to
be
no
good
in
this
case.
i
think
that
our
concern,
as
i
hope
to
explain
somewhat
later,
is
not
that
in
this
case
they
couldn't
have
gotten
a
warrant.
i
mean,
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
in
this
case.
the
problem
that
fouled
them
up
in
this
case
was
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
safety
and
the
secrecy
of
the
informant's
status,
and
they
chose
what
turned
out
to
be
an
ill-advised
means
of
attempting
to
protect
against
the
ultimate
disclosure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
their
concern,
and
i
think
this
is
a
concern
which
this
court
has
not
visited,
and
maybe
one
day
a
case
will
arise
about
what
the
appropriate
procedures
are
for
protecting
the
identity
of
a
confidential
informant
where
at
some
point
down
the
road
there
is
likely
to
be
disclosure
to
defendants
in
the
event
a
criminal
case
comes,
for
instance,
of
the
contents
of
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant.
now,
i
think
that
probably
the
procedure
that
should
have
been
used
here
was
to
make
an
accurate
description
in
the
search
warrant
and
file
it
under
seal,
but
at
some
point
down
the
road
you
can
be
sure
that
the
defendants
would
have
demanded
the
right
to
see
it.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
of
course,
muehlenweg's
identity
as
an
informant
was
disclosed
at
the
suppression
hearing,
but
there
is
a
concern.
i
don't
think
that
the
action
of
the
agent
and
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
outrageous
in
this
case,
even
if
in
retrospect
we
can
say
it
was
ill-advised,
but
the
real
concern
about
requiring
us
to
get
a
warrant
is
not
so
much
that
we
can't
do
it,
although
i
don't
think
it
performs
a
very
useful
function,
as
i
will
get
to
later,
but
that
there
are
classes
of
cases
in
which
the
use
of
the
beeper
is
very
important
but
we
don't
have
probable
cause,
but
only
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
so
that
if
you
are...
the
holding
that
a
warrant
is
required
is
a
holding
that
beeper
surveillance
cannot
be
employed
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity,
i
think
that
is
our
practical
concern.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
of
course
it
does.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
of
course
it
does,
and
that
was...
i
thought...
i
tried
to
make
that
point
in
response
to
justice
stevens.
if
we
had
to
enter
somebody's
property
to
instal
the
warrant,
that
entry
would
be
a
search...
i
mean,
to
instal
the
beeper,
and
that
search
would
require
a
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
not
any
of
the
respondents'
property
at
the
time
it
was
entered.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
the
action
would
be
a
search
or
a
seizure
that
is
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
any
evidentiary
fruits
unless
the
beeper
were
listened
to,
but
i
certainly
agree
that
if
we
have
to
go
into
somebody's
private
property
for
purposes
of
installing
a
beeper,
as
in
the
dalia
case
where
an
entry
had
to
be
made
for
purposes
of
installing
the
bug,
that,
of
course,
is
a
search,
and
unless
there
is
a
warrant
that
authorizes
it,
it
would
be
invalid.
i
just
wanted
to
make
the
point
before
i
get
back
to
justice
white's
question,
which
i
do
want
to
address,
that
this
case
is
typical
in
demonstrating
the
value
of
the
beeper
in
illicit
drug
manufacturing
investigations,
because
people
involved
in
such
activities
often
proceed
very
cautiously
with
various
kinds
of
countersurveillance
activities,
which
include,
as
in
this
case,
moving
the
containers
to
seven
different
locations
and
delaying
their
actual...
actually
putting
them
to
their
illicit
use
for
a
period
of
four
and
a
half
months.
now,
effective
investigation
and
apprehension
in
this
case
would
have
been
as
a
practical
matter
impossible
even
though
as
a
theoretical
matter
if
we
were
willing
to
assign
100
agents
to
the
task
for
a
period
of
four
and
a
half
months
we
could
have
done
it,
but
with
the
beeper,
a
handful
of
agents
who
can
also
do
other
things
at
the
same
time
are
able
to
conduct
an
effective
investigation
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
serious
crime.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
about
whether
this
is
or
is
not
any
different
from
knotts,
because
our
position
is
that
this
case
is
not
analytically
different
from
knotts,
and
that
what
happened
here
was
not
a
search.
now,
the
point
essentially
that
we
want
to
make
is
that
knotts
established
that
to
use
the
beeper
to
ascertain
the
location
to
which
a
container
has
been
taken
over
the
public
roads
is
not
a
search
at
all
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment.
well,
in
this
case,
the
beeper
was
used
for
that
purpose.
that
is,
the
information
that
we
got
that
was
relevant
to
this
investigation
had
to
do
with
the
movement
from
place
to
place
on
the
public
highways.
now,
justice
white
points
out
that
it
is
possible
that
some
kind
of
shell
game
could
be
attempted
to
be
played
by
the
suspects--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
track
it
to
the
first
house.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
then
if
we
don't
have
a
beeper
we
station
an
agent
outside
the
first
house.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
the
agent,
incidentally,
knows
as
much
as
the
beeper
tells
us
about
the
presence
of
the
containers
on
or
in
the
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
in
the
vicinity.
keep
in
mind
that
in
this--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
is
entitled
to
know
that,
and
he
is
entitled
to
watch
the
house.
and
if
a
truck
leaves
that
he
thinks
has
the
containers,
he
is
entitled
to
follow
it
to
its
next
destination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
all
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
may
not
know
without
the
beeper,
but
he
can
follow
or
agents
can
follow
every
one
of
them
until
finally
one
of
them
arrives
at
the
laboratory
site
where
by
other
observations
they
are
able
to
determine
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
conventional
search
and
to
secure
a
warrant.
so,
even
in
these
cases,
agents
stationed
outside
each
of
these
properties
waiting
until
somebody
leaves
who
might
be
carrying
ten
five-gallon
cans
of
ether
or
one
five-gallon
can
of
ether...
it
could
be
accomplished
by
a
visual
surveillance.
now,
another
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--oh,
absolutely,
and
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no,
but
you
see,
the
argument
that
is
being
made
to
which
i
am
responding
is
not
quite
a
conceptual
argument.
i
mean,
i
begin
by
saying
we
trace
the
beeper
container
to
the
first
premises.
we
station
agents
outside.
when
the
truck
loaded
with
these
containers
goes
to
the
next
premises,
we
follow
it,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
now,
justice
white
says,
well,
maybe
we
won't
be
able
to
tell
what
is
in
the
truck.
the
truck
may
be
a
closed
truck.
it
may
be
in
the
trunk
of
a
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
may
be.
there
may
be,
but
conceptually
nothing
has
changed.
that
is,
we
are
still
using
the
beeper
to
follow
vehicles
on
the
open
highway,
and
what
the
court
said
in
knotts
is
the
fact
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--oh,
of
course
we
are
doing
something...
we
are
doing
something
terribly
useful,
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
is
that
what
knotts
said
was
the
fact
that
we
are
more
efficient,
even
a
great
deal
more
efficient
in
doing
what
we
could
otherwise
do
through
surveillance
of
the
public
streets
and
highways
does
not
affect
the
fourth
amendment
inquiry
as
to
whether
you
have
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
theory
we
could
do
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
what...
but
we
are
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
is
possible
that
that
is
true.
whether
that
changes
it
from
the
fact
that
the
beeper
is
being
used
to
track
the
movements
on
the
highway,
i
am
not
certain,
but
i
wanted...
my
time
is
running
short.
i
wanted
to
make
a
point.
the
fact
that
it
is
in
the
house
which
was
so
critical
to
respondents'
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
first
of
all
overlooks
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
that
it
was
in
the
first
three
houses
at
all.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
the
only
house
or
even
storage
locker
that
we
learned
it
was
in
by
use
of
the
beeper
was
the
ultimate
destination
in
taos,
and
as
to
that,
that
piece
of
information
as
to
whether
it
was
in
or
out
of
the
house
was
wholly
immaterial
to
the
probable
cause
showing
and
the
warrant
which
was
based
on
informant's
information
that
that
was
the
location,
the
open
windows,
and
the
fact
that
the
ether
had
been
taken
there--
now,
in
your
example
we
don't
ever
have
to
train
the
beeper
on
the
house
to
find
out
what
is
in
the
house,
because
each
time
a
car
leaves
we
can
follow
that
car,
check
with
the
beeper
whether
the
container
is
in
that
car.
now,
we
may
be
searching
that
car,
something
for
which
we
ordinarily
don't
need
a
warrant,
or
we
may
not
be
searching
that
car.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
we
have
probable
cause.
for
a
conventional
search.
and
i
did
hope
to
talk
some
about
the
point
which
is
much
more
important
in
the
real
world,
which
is
what
the
regime
of
regulation
would
be
if
you
held
that
this
was
a
search,
because
what
is
important
to
us
is
the
ability
to
use
this
technique
in
circumstances
where
a
chemical
company
calls
us
up
and
says
we
have
a
very
suspicious
purchase
of
ether
or
chloroform
or
some
chemical
precursor
from
somebody
we
don't
know
and
we
are
suspicious.
this
is
probably
not
probable
cause
that
would
be
enough
to
justify
us
getting
a
warrant
to
search
the
house
of
the
person
if
we
followed
them
to
that
place
where
they
took
the
container,
yet
it
is
enough
to
warrant
an
investigation,
and
in
adams
against
williams
the
court
said
the
policeman
shouldn't
just
shrug
his
shoulders
and
go
away,
that
the
only
effective
means
of
investigation
in
this
circumstance,
the
most
effective
means
is
the
use
of
the
beeper.
it
has
a
very
limited
intrusion,
if
any,
on
people's
privacy,
and
it
seems
to
me
when
you
balance
that
intrusion
against
the
value
to
law
enforcement,
a
terry
kind
of
standard
is
quite
appropriate,
and
i
just
would
refer
to
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
jacobson
where
he
made
precisely
that
point.
there
was
some
concern
about
not
having
any
fourth
amendment
regulation,
but
he
suggested
that
you
could
allay
those
concerns
by
having
a
regime
of
regulation
that
requires
reasonable
suspicion
before
a
technique
of
limited
intrusiveness
can
be
used,
and
that
would
accomplish
in
the
real
world
the
purposes
that
we
need.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
couple
of
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
first,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
case
is
not
at
all
like
the
questioning
that
we
had
during
the
knotts
argument
involving
the
use
of
a
beeper
to
monitor
the
movement
within
a
house
from
place
to
place
or
the
opening.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case,
no
evidence
that
the
beeper
was
used
for
that
purpose.
there
is
no
interest
in
using
it
for
that
purpose.
we
would
be,
in
fact,
perfectly
happy
if
you
suppressed
all
of
the
evidence
about
whether
it
was
inside
any
one
of
these
houses.
that
is
not
evidence
that
is
material
or
used.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
not
material
to
the
search
warrant,
because
they
knew...
they
had
information
from
muehlenweg
that
there
was
a
cocaine
manufacturing
operation
going
on
in
taos.
they
had
followed
the
ether
to
the
house,
and
they
saw
the
windows
open,
which
told
them
that
the
ether
was
inside
being
used.
so
it
was
wholly
superfluous,
the
particular
fix,
and
that
raises
the
question
about
respondents
roth
and
steele.
the
only
claim
that
they
could
have
is
with
respect
to
the
use
at
the
taos
residence,
which
was
immaterial
to
the
procurement
of
the
warrant
and
the
seizure
of
the
evidence.
with
respect
to
the
first
three
premises
to
the
vicinity
of
which
it
was
taken,
there
is
no
evidence
that
it
went
into
karo's
house
or
horton's
house
or
horton's
father's
house.
in
fact,
i
rather
doubt
that
50
gallons
of
ether,
which
is
highly
explosive,
not
to
mention
the
effect
of
the
fumes,
would
be
taken
inside.
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
legally
in
this
case,
but
the
whole
lynchpin
of
their
argument
is
that
we
are
searching
their
house,
that
what
is
happening
in
this
case
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
we
sent
a
police
officer
inside
to
walk
around
the
house
trying
to
find
the
ether.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
have
two
separate
arguments.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
second
argument,
which
is
also
quite
important
to
us,
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
search,
it
is
a
limited
intrusion
in
its
nature,
revealing
only
the
single
fact
which
ordinarily
at
least
would
be
visible
by
observation,
and
therefore
that
a
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is
sufficient.
i
mean,
that
is
quite
important
to
us.
i
might
point
out
that
a
warrant...
it
is
very
peculiar.
they
say
we
are
searching
their
home,
yet
they
must
concede
that
a
warrant
could
not
particularly
describe
the
place
to
be
searched.
all
we
could
have
is
what
is
in
effect
a
writ
of
assistance
allowing
us
to
use
this
particular
search
technique,
whatever
home
this
may
be
taken
to.
with
respect
to
justice
white's
question
during
my
opening
argument,
there
was
one
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
with
respect
to
this
shell
game
or
concealed
departure,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
was
in
fact
any
movement
of
this
that
would
not
have
been
visible
to
surveilling
agents.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
was
looking
for
that.
i
could
not
find
it.
when
the
cans
were
removed
from
the
second
storage
locker
and
taken
up
to
taos,
the
affidavit
simply
says
that
they
were...
they
saw
the
cans
being
removed
on
the
videotape.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
found...
when
this
came
up
before
i
was
looking
for
it
and
i
couldn't--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--find
the
reference.
