mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
don't
want
to
belabor
this
discussion
that
has
gone
on
quite
a
bit
already
about
the
nature
of
taking
into
account
the
intervening
conviction
here,
but
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
about
it.
the
main
thing,
i
think,
is
that
this
is
all
quite
beside
the
point.
petitioner
has
made
a
lot
of
whether
judge
roettger
really
gave
an
appropriate
sentence
here
because
judge
davis
had
already
taken
things
into
account,
the
matter
was
already
before
judge
davis,
mr.
wasman
is
an
old
man.
the
question
for
the
court
is
not
to
review
the
appropriateness
of
judge
roettger's
sentence.
this
is
a
constitutional
case,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
was
violated
by
the
increase
of
the
sentence
after
retrial.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
talking
a
little
bit
about
the
factual
background
here
because
i
think
the
statements
that
were
made
in
the
record
at
the
two
sentencing
proceedings
pretty
clearly
indicate
that
there
was
no
conceivable
process
violation.
at
the
first
sentencing
hearing
the
government
called
the
court's
attention
to
this
pending
indictment
on
the
mail
fraud
charges.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
there
that
the
defense
counsel
asked
the
court
not
to
take
that
into
account.
this
is
on
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
explained
that
mr.
wasman
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
tell
his
story
and
connects
him
with
the
mail
fraud
charges,
and
then
he
said,
i
quote,
"i
respectfully
suggest
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
government
to
be
arguing
that
mr.
wasman's
entitled
to
some
sort
of
enhanced
punishment
in
this
passport
case
by
virtue
of
the
mail
fraud
indictment.
"
judge
was...
excuse
me,
judge
roettger
agreed
with
that
and
said
it
was
his
general
policy
not
to
take
pending
charges
into
account.
he
also
said,
and
again
i
quote
from
the
same
page:
"my
theory
of
sentencing
is
simply
that
one
can
consider
prior
convictions
and
judges
not
only
may
but
should
consider
prior
convictions.
"
at
that
point
he
sentenced
petitioner
under
the
split
sentence
provision
of
18
usc
3561
to
two
years
imprisonment,
with
all
but
six
months
of
that
sentence
suspended
in
favor
of
three
years'
probation.
after
petitioner
succeeded
in
getting
his
conviction
reversed
on
appeal,
he
came
back
for
resentencing
after
his
second
conviction
before
judge
roettger.
and
at
that
time,
of
course,
a
conviction
had
been
entered
on
the
misdemeanor
that
arose
out
of
the
mail
fraud
charges.
at
that
hearing
judge
roettger
focused
on
this
intervening
conviction
and
made
it
clear
that
that
was
his
reason
for
changing
the
sentence.
he
said...
this
is
at
page
a42
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition:
"at
that
time
he
came
before
me
with
two
convictions.
"
"the
last
time
he
came
before
me
with
one
conviction.
"
and
the
court
explained
that
it
considered
the
conviction
to
which
mr.
wasman
had
pled
during
the
intervening
time
to
be
a
more
serious
offense
and
that
it
warranted
a
higher
sentence.
at
this
time
he
sentenced
him
to
two
years
imprisonment.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
because
of
the
provisions
of
18
usc
3651
he
could
not
have
simply
sentenced
him
to
eight
months
imprisonment,
impose
the
same
split
sentence
that
he
had
before,
just
increasing
the
imprisonment
time
a
little
bit,
because
3651
has
a
six-month
maximum
on
the
amount
of
imprisonment
time
that
may
be
imposed
where
there's
a
split
sentence.
we
suggest
that
nothing
in
this
history
suggests
anything
more
than
the
normal
sentencing
decisions
by
a
judge.
on
its
face
there's
no
hint
of
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
petitioner's
claim
that
there
is
a
due
process
violation
rests
entirely
on
north
carolina
v.
pearce.
pearce
did
recognize
a
due
process
limitation
on
resentencing
after
appeal,
but
it
certainly
did
not
impose
an
absolute
ban
on
a
higher
sentence.
quite
the
contrary,
the
court
explicitly
stated
there
at
page
723
that
a
trial
judge
is
not
constitutionally
precluded
from
imposing
a
higher
sentence
after
a
retrial
in
light
of
events
subsequent
to
the
first
trial
which
shed
new
light
on
the
sentencing
decision.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
a
little
bit
later,
but
there
are
two
separate
statements
in
pearce.
once
the
court
uses
the
term
"events"
subsequent
to
the
first
trial,
and
at
a
later
point
it
refers
to
conduct
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
so
there
is
certainly
some
ambiguity
as
to
exactly
what
the
court
meant.
what
pearce
did
hold
is
that
it
violates
due
process
to
impose
a
greater
sentence
in
retaliation
for
the
defendant's
exercise
of
his
right
to
appeal.
to
protect
against
the
realistic
possibility
of
such
a
vindictive
motivation,
whether
conscious
or,
more
likely,
a
subconscious
motivation,
and
to
avoid
unfairly
chilling
the
right
to
appeal
by
assuring
defendants
that
such
vindictive
resentencing
will
not
be
allowed,
the
court
in
pearce
set
for
a
prophylactic
rule
prohibiting
such
a
sentence
increase
unless
justified
by
specific
reasons
placed
on
the
record
by
the
sentencing
judge.
now
it's
clear
beyond
doubt
from
pearce
and
from
the
other
due
process
cases
that
have
followed
it
that
the
concern
there
is
with
preventing
actual
vindictiveness,
in
this
context
an
increased
sentence
that
is
imposed
actually
in
retaliation
for
the
taking
of
an
appeal.
this
danger
arises
because
of
the
human
element
that
is
involved
in
resentencing.
it
is
possible
and
difficult
to
determine
from
the
record
that
a
judge
will
in
fact
harbor
some
vindictive
motivation,
perhaps
subconsciously.
if
sentences
were
imposed
by
machines
under
some
formula,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
north
carolina
v.
pearce
rule.
and
in
fact
the
court
held
that
in
kind
of
an
analogous
situation
in
chaffin
v.
stynchcombe,
where
the
sentence
the
second
time
around
was
to
be
imposed
by
a
jury
that
did
not
know
what
the
first
sentence
was.
there
the
court
realized
there
was
no
possibility
that
the
jury
would
have
a
vindictive
motivation,
not
even
knowing
what
the
first
sentence
was,
and
it
held
that
the
pearce
rule
did
not
apply.
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
so
the
so-called
chilling
effect
that
pearce
is
concerned
with
is
an
unfair
chilling
effect
that
defendants
may
be
worried
that
they're
going
to
get
an
unfair
higher
sentence
later,
a
vindictive
higher
sentence.
but
there
is
nothing
unfair
about
them
taking
the
risk
of
getting
a
valid
higher
sentence
later,
and
pearce
and
the
due
process
clause
does
not
protect
against
that
possibility.
i
won't
read
it
again
here,
but
i
think
this
is
stated
quite
clearly
by
the
court
in
chaffin
at
page
25
and
the
three
printed
pages
16
to
17
of
our
brief,
the
fact
that
in
pearce
the
possibility
of
a
higher
sentence
was
recognized
and
accepted
as
as
legitimate
concomitant
of
the
retrial
process.
thus,
when
a
sentence
is
increased
for
valid,
non-vindictive
reasons,
no
pearce
problem
is
presented.
as
the
court
explained
in
goodwin,
the
rule
of
pearce
simply
imposes
a
presumption
of
vindictiveness.
this
alleviates
the
practical
difficulty
of
proving
motivation
for
the
defendant,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
rule.
when
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
clearly
dispel
the
realistic
possibility
of
vindictiveness
by
demonstrating
a
valid
reason
for
the
increase,
there
should
be
no
bar
to
the
imposition
of
a
higher
sentence
on
retrial.
now
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
the
only
reason
that
can
validly
be
used
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
on
retrial
is
one
that
is
based
on
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
occurs
subsequent
to
the
first
trial.
now
putting
aside
for
one
moment
what
the
opinion
in
pearce
has
to
say
about
that,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there's
been
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
due
process
clause
should
require
such
a
rule.
i
think
as
we
fully
explained
our
brief
this
sort
of
distinction
simply
makes
no
sense
with
respect
to
the
policies
that
underlie
pearce
and
the
overall
thrust
of
the
decision.
if
this
sort
of
distinction
does
apply,
it
would
have
quite
undesirable
consequences
in
the
sentencing
process
without
advancing
the
policies
of
the
due
process
clause
one
iota.
and
i'd
like
to
give
a
few
examples
of
that.
one
is
the
example
that
is
given
in
this
case,
where
there
is
an
intervening
conviction...
excuse
me...
after
the
first
sentence
was
imposed
by
the
judge.
now
he
has
additional
information
before
him
that
suggests
that
a
defendant
perhaps
deserves
a
higher
sentence.
under
the
rule
suggested
by
petitioner,
the
judge
is
not
allowed
to
take
this
into
account.
this
is
highlighted
in
this
case
and
perhaps
more
egregiously
in
the
williams
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
that
case,
a
case
where
the
court
found
the
conduct
language
in
pearce
to
be
controlling.
the
court
was
unable
on
the
resentencing
to
take
into
account
what
i
believe
was
a
murder,
state
murder
conviction
that
occurred
later.
another
example
is
the
hypothetical
suggested
by
justice
white,
where
in
fact
nothing
happens
after
the
first
trial,
but
more
information
comes
to
light
that
wasn't
available
the
first
time
around.
then
we
learn
that
the
defendant
has
quite
a
long
rap
sheet
and
really
is
a
much
more
serious
offender
than
was
thought
before.
and
finally
i
think
an
important
situation
to
be
taken
into
account
and
one
that
has
come
before
this
court
before
in
michigan
v.
payne...
the
case
where
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
and
is
sentenced
on
the
basis
of
a
guilty
plea.
the
court
has
recognized
many
times
that
judges
usually
impose
leniency
when
a
guilty
plea
is
entered.
now
sometimes
the
defendant
may
collaterally
attack
the
validity
of
his
guilty
plea
and
ultimately
go
to
trial
a
second
time
if
he
succeeds
in
that
attack.
now
it
just
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
the
judge
should
be
restricted
to
the
sentence
that
he
imposed
the
first
time,
the
lenient
sentence
that
he
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
guilty
plea,
when
the
defendant
ends
up
going
to
trial.
now
to
digress
for
a
moment
as
to
exactly
what
the
opinion
in
pearce
says,
i
think
there
are
three
different
basic
kinds
of
situations
here.
one
is
where
there's
actual
conduct,
bad
acts,
by
the
defendant
after
the
first
trial.
the
petitioner
himself
agrees
that
a
higher
sentence
on
retrial
would
be
permissible
if
based
on
such
conduct.
the
second
class
is
where
some
event
takes
place
after
trial.
that
would
be
this
case,
i
believe,
where
the
conviction
has
been
entered
but
in
fact
there
was
no
bad
act
committed
by
the
defendant
during
that
time.
it's
our
position,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
that
the
court
in
pearce
contemplated
that
an
event
such
as
that,
such
as
the
one
in
this
case,
would
equally
be
permissible
to
be
used
by
the
judge
as
a
basis
for
increasing
the
sentence
at
the
second
trial.
petitioner
disagrees
with
that
and
focuses
only
on
this
one
isolated
statement
at
the
end
of
the
opinion.
but,
as
i
say,
our
position
is
that
everything
in
pearce
is
fully
consistent
with
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
here.
now
there
is
a
third
class
of
cases,
the
hypothetical
suggested
by
justice
white,
where
there's
really
no
event
after
the
first
trial
ends,
but
there
is
new
information
that
comes
to
light
that
would
seem
to
justify
a
higher
sentence.
now
in
our
view
such
information
should
also
be
grounds
for
imposing
a
higher
sentence
if
it
in
fact
justifies
the
higher
sentence.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
opinion
in
pearce
suggests
that
in
fact
the
court
did
not
contemplate
that
such
information
would
be
available
and
we
suggested
in
our
brief
that
that
is
dictum
and
that
the
court
ought
to
reconsider
it
here.
we're
not
really
asking
the
court
to
come
up
with
a
rule
one
way
or
the
other,
but
more
or
less
to
back
away
from
what
it
said
before
and
leave
these
kind
of
questions
to
be
decided
by
the
lower
courts.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
hope
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
all
i
was
saying
is
that
there
is
certainly
some
of
the
language
in
the
opinion
of
pearce
suggests
that
if
no
event
occurs--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
there's
language
each
way
as
far
as
the
conduct
of
the
defendant.
but
as
far
as
the
requirement
that
something
occur
after
the
first
trial,
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
in
pearce
that
would
authorize
a
higher
sentence
at
that
point.
we
think
that
in
all
these
situations--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--we're
not
really
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion.
what
we're
asking
for
is
for
the
court
to
back
away
from
its
previous
advisory
opinion
and
to
say
that
this
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--unreliable,
not
necessarily
wrong.
i'm
not
saying
it's
wrong,
just
that
it's
an
open
question
at
this
point.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
certainly
in
this
case
i
think
under
any
reading
of
pearce
the
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
relief
here.
it's
just
inconceivable
that
on
the
facts
here
there
was
any
vindictiveness.
you
could
hardly
have
a
stronger
case
for
dispelling
the
vindictiveness
in
this
case.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions--
