unknown
speaker
did
your
client
request
that
kind
of
consideration
from
judge
roettger?
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
view
that
was
not
improper?
unknown
speaker
for
the
judge
not
to
consider
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
that
he
could
have
considered
it?
unknown
speaker
a
pending
charge
or
the
facts
behind
the
pending
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
had
would
this
case
be
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
see
something
illogical
about
that?
unknown
speaker
that
the
first
time,
since
it's
only
a
charge,
why
the
sentencing
judge
will
not
consider
it.
now,
after
the
second
trial,
it
is
no
longer
just
a
change;
it
is
a
conviction.
therefore,
i
will
take
it
into
account.
is
that
logical
or
illogical?
unknown
speaker
it's
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
saying
in
effect
that
the
judge
only
gets
one
bite
at
the
apple.
if
the
judge
who
is
sentencing
the
person
for
the
substantive
conviction
takes
the
substantive
conviction
into
account,
then
another
judge
before
whom
he
is
found
guilty
of
another
charge
can't
take
into
account
the
alternate
substantive
conviction
because
he's
already
been
sentenced
on
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
what,
then,
is
the
inference
that
you
want
us
to
draw
from
saying
that
judge
davis
had
already
taken
the
mail
fraud
into
consideration.
he'd
taken
it
into
consideration
in
sentencing
him
for
the
mail
fraud,
hadn't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
that
would
be
true
of
every
single
conviction
that
there
ever
was,
i
would
think,
for
which
a
person
was
sentenced
to
anything,
that
the
judge
would
have
taken
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
charges
upon
which
the
jury
returned
a
guilty
verdict.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
that
that
having
happened
another
judge
trying
him
for
an
independent
offense
cannot
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
wholly
independent
charge
in
setting
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
pearce
rule
may
be
one
thing.
but
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
it
really...
that
the
"have
your
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
"
argument
didn't
make
any
sense
here
because
judge
davis
had
taken
into
consideration
the
mail
fraud
conviction.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
argument,
i
think,
of
whether
in
the
passport
violation
charge
at
some
point
the...
either
the
pending
charge
or
the
conviction
for
the
mail
fraud
misdemeanor
should
be
considered
by
the
judge
sentencing
for
the
passport
fraud.
to
say
that
the
judge
sentencing
for
the
misdemeanor
took
into
consideration
the
misdemeanor
is
no
answer
to
the
other
charge.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
read
judge
markey's
language
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
suggesting
that
the
defendant
was
complaining
or
that
the
state
was
complaining
that
the
mail
fraud
would
never
be
considered
on
the
substance,
but
that
so
far
as
augmenting
is
concerned,
first
it
was
too
early
and
then
it
was
too
late.
and
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
judge
davis
considered
the
charge
in
sentencing
him
really
is
an
answer
to
that.
unknown
speaker
you're
entitled
to
differ,
obviously.
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
not--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
he
was
giving
the
man
the
full
benefit
of
the
presumption
of
innocence,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
but
you
then
say
later
on
he
cannot
take
the
conviction
into
account
when
the
presumption
of
innocence
has
been
merged
and
washed
out
by
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
what
vindictiveness
do
you
spell
out
here?
pearce
indeed
was
a
state
of
mind
holding,
wasn't
it...
a
state
of
mind
of
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
see
the
vindictiveness
here?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
prophylactic
nature
of
the
pearce
rule
is
such
that
if
at
the
initial
trial
the
trial
judge
takes
into
effect
those
prior
convictions
shown
on
the
rap
sheet,
he's
got
two,
say,
he's
got
two
and
he
takes
those
into
account.
but
the
judgment
is
reversed.
there
is
a
retrial
and
he
comes
to
the
sentencing
phase
again
and
it
turns
out
that
he's
now
got
a
rap
sheet
that
the
first
one
was
just
wrong.
he's
been
convicted
five
times,
six
times.
must
he
ignore
those
other
three
or
four
convictions
in
sentencing
the
second
time?
i
would
think
you
would
say
he
has
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
could
it
depend
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
conduct
has
all
happened
before...
all
those
convictions
happened
before
his
first
conviction?
unknown
speaker
so
he
may
never,
ever
then
have
a
sentence
at
the
second
trial
that
takes
into
account
all
of
what
would
have
been
valid
considerations
at
the
first;
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
he's
escaping
the
punishment
that
could
have
validly
been
imposed
on
him
at
the
first
trial,
except
for
some
other
trial
error.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
i
take
it
you
think
the
prophylactic--
unknown
speaker
--forbids
at
the
second
trial
taking
into
account
things
that
could
have
been
taken
into
at
the
first
trial
but
were
erroneously
excluded.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moskowitz,
what
is
some
event
occurs
after
the
first
trial
that's
favorable
to
the
defendant,
for
instance
a
prior
conviction
is
reversed
and
set
aside
by
an
appellate
court
and
so
by
the
time
of
the
retrial
in
your
situation
the
sentencing
judge
after
the
retrial,
can
he
consider
the
fact
that
now
there
is
one
less
prior
conviction?
unknown
speaker
it
helps
the
defendant,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
isn't
the
reverse
true,
too?
why
shouldn't
the
judge
be
able
to
consider
it
either
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
be
at
peace
with
the
knowledge
that
whatever
happens
afterwards
the
court
can
consider
it,
whether
it
helps
him
or
hurts
him...
any
event.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
literally
read
in
this
case
what
was
taken
into
account
was
something
that
happened
after
his
first
conviction.
literally
read,
he
pled
guilty
or
nolo
to
a
charge,
and
that
certainly
is...
that
is
not
a
non-event,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
conduct
on
his
part.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
read
pearce
as
trying
to
set
up
barriers
to
vindictiveness,
how
can
you
spell
out
any
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
the
judge
here,
possible
vindictiveness?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
then
would
also
say
pearce
would
prevent
the
trial
judge
taking
into
account
another
conviction
that
occurred
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
based
on
conduct
that
was
never
known
at
all
until
after
his
first
conviction?
unknown
speaker
based
on
conduct
that
occurred
prior
to
his
first
conviction
but
nobody'd
ever
heard
of
it
when
he
was
first
convicted.
it
turns
out
that
he
made
some
statements
that
led
to
other
indictments.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
barred
by
some
principle,
but
not
by
pearce.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
in
effect
that
if
your
client,
mr.
wasman,
is
convicted
of
robbery
in
one
court
and
a
false
impersonation
in
another
court
and
the
two
cases
go
on
pari
passu
and
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
conviction
on
each
count
on
the
same
day...
let's
assume
that
he
was
able
to
go
to
one
court
in
the
morning
and
one
court
in
the
afternoon
and
the
court
could
schedule
it
that
way...
then
neither
judge
or
at
least
both
judges
could
not
take
into
consideration
both
the
fact
of
the
conviction
returned
in
their
court
and
augment
it
by
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
another
conviction
against
the
man
was
returned
in
another
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
pearce,
though,
is
it?
you
say
they
could
or
they
couldn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what's
your
objection?
it
seems
to
me
your
objection
here
that
judge
davis
had
already
taken
into
account
something
doesn't
wash.
unknown
speaker
but
the
have
your
cake
and
eat
it,
too,
argument
is
that
in
respect
to
this
particular
passport
conviction
that
it
shouldn't
be
allowed
a
defendant
to
say
first
it's
too
early
to
consider
this
charge
because
it
hasn't
ripened
into
a
conviction,
and
then
it
comes
around
again
now
it's
too
late
to
consider
it
because
you
could
have
considered
it
before.
unknown
speaker
but
up
to
that
time,
the
very
instant
of
the
nolo
plea,
he
was
clothed
with
the
presumption
of
innocence,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
that
disappeared
somewhat
by
the
nolo
plea.
unknown
speaker
on
the
contrary,
his
position,
the
judge's
position,
that
he
would
not
take
it
into
account
when
it
was
only
a
charge,
an
indictment
as
distinguished
from
a
conviction,
suggests
that
he
wasn't
a
judge
that
harbored
vindictiveness,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
this
one
question.
is
your
position
at
all...
would
your
position
be
any
different
if
it
were
a
guilty
plea
rather
than
a
nolo
plea
in
the
other
case?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
it
was
just
a
nolo
plea?
i
don't
think
you've
argued
it
so
far.
unknown
speaker
you'd
make
the
same
argument
for
a
guilty
plea?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
a
while
ago,
and
you
did
make
the
same
argument
based
on
a
guilty
plea.
unknown
speaker
or
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
very
well.
mr.
horowitz.
unknown
speaker
the
term
was
"events".
unknown
speaker
even
though
the...
after
that
decision
defendants
might
have
a
realistic
fear
of
being
sentenced
to
a
longer
sentence
after
appeal.
unknown
speaker
well,
logically
it's
events
and
information
not
previously
available
that
must
have
been
in
the
minds
of
the
court
in
pearce.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
a
mechanical
rule
where
you
just
touch
a
computer.
if
the
court
didn't
have
the
information
at
one
point
but
had
information,
adverse
information,
that
was
relevant
to
a
sentence,
pearce...
i
do
not
read
pearce
as
precluding
the
use
of
that.
unknown
speaker
some
each
way.
there's
some
language
each
way
in
that
respect.
unknown
speaker
this
third
situation
you're
really
asking
just
for
an
advisory
opinion,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
our
prior
advice
was
unreliable?
unknown
speaker
what
you
really
want
us
to
do
is
construe
pearce
and
the
cases
that
have
come
since
then
as
not
providing
for
any
relief
for
the
petitioner
here;
isn't
that
the
net
of
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
moskowitz?
