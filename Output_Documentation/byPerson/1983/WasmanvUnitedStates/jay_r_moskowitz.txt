mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
in
another
in
a
line
of
cases
following
this
court's
decision
in
north
carolina
v.
pearce
in
1969
dealing
with
under
what
circumstances
may
a
trial
judge
impose
a
harsher
sentence
following
retrial
and
reconviction
after
a
first
conviction
has
been
reversed
on
appeal.
in
pearce
this
court
announced
that
double
jeopardy
does
not
absolutely
bar
an
enhancement
of
sentence,
but
the
court
also
announced
in
pearce
that
due
process
requires
that
when
a
judge
chooses
to
enhance
following
a
second
conviction
that
vindictiveness
on
his
part
must
play
no
part
in
that
enhancement,
and
further
that
because
a
defendant
may
be
fearful
when
decided
whether
to
take
an
appeal
or
not
that
if
he
does
and
gets
a
new
trial
the
sentence
may
be
enhanced
because
the
judge
is
vindictive
against
him,
that
the
apprehension
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
should
be
taken
away.
in
order
to
effectuate
those
two
goals
set
out
in
pearce,
this
court
set
out
a
prophylactic
rule
that:
one,
on
resentencing
the
district
judge,
the
trial
judge,
must
announce
on
the
record
his
reasons
for
enhancing
the
sentence;
and,
two,
that
those
reasons
must
be
based
on
objective
information
of
identifiable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
that
conduct
occurring
subsequent
to
the
first
sentencing
procedure.
in
the
case
at
hand
on
these
facts
the
defendant's
sentence
following
his
second
trial
and
conviction
was
enhanced
not
on
any
conduct
that
he
did,
but
on
an
intervening
act,
that
is,
a
conviction
on
preexisting
conduct
that
occurred
between
the
first
and
second
sentencing
hearings.
i
think
that
in
order
to
best
understand
the
issue
i
should
set
out
now
on
a
fairly
detailed
analysis
of
the
procedural
process
of
the
two
convictions.
in
1978,
milton
wasman
was
indicted
in
two
separate
indictments,
one
dealing
with
the
obtaining
of
a
passport
using
a
false
name,
and
the
second
indictment
charging
him
with
several
counts
of
mail
fraud.
in
september
of
1979
the
passport
case
came
up
for
trial
and
he
was
found
guilty.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
after
that
first
trial,
the
judge,
judge
roettger,
said
that
he
was...
he
knew
about
the
other
indictment
but
he
was
not
going
to
consider
the
pending
indictment
in
passing
sentence
upon
wasman,
and
passed
sentence,
sentencing
him
to
six
months
in
jail.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
in
the
colloquy
back
and
forth...
i
didn't
represent
him
in
that
proceeding,
but
in
the
colloquy
back
and
forth,
justice
rehnquist,
before
judge
roettger
the
government
made
some
kind
of
statement
about
the
pending
case.
his
counsel
at
the
time
made
a
comment
about
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
involved
in
the
case.
there
was
some
procedural
arguing
back
and
forth,
discussing
back
and
forth.
then
judge
roettger
made
the
pronouncement
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
considering
it
because
he
doesn't
consider
pending
indictments.
he
thinks
it's
unfair
to
the
defendant.
it...
certainly
judge
roettger's
comment
was
in
response
to
a
colloquy
back
and
forth.
whether
or
not
there
was
a
specific
request
don't
consider
it,
it's
unclear.
but
he
certainly
did
not
consider
it
and
the
defendant
certainly
had
no
objection
to
him
not
considering
it.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
improper
in
what
way?
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
under
williams
v.
new
york
he
certainly
could
have
considered
it.
i
think
it
was,
as
defense
counsel
i
would
ask
a
judge
at
a
sentencing
not
to
consider
a
pending
indictment
because
the
indictment
could
go
any
way.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
he
could
have
considered
it
if
he
had
chosen
to.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well,
he
could
have,
yes.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
this
case
probably,
i
am
sure,
would
be
a
very
different
case
because
he
certainly...
his
basis...
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
his
basis
for
enhancing
after
the
second
trial
was
that
i
didn't
consider
it
the
first
time
around.
now
it's
a
conviction,
now
i'm
going
to
consider
it.
if
he
had
considered
it
the
first
time
around,
he
certainly
could
not
have
made
the
statement
at
the
second
sentencing
that
he
made.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
that
he
didn't
consider
it?
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
it's...
based
on
the
rationale
behind
pearce,
it's
not
illogical.
pearce--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--it's
not
illogical.
i
think
that,
and
i've
been
asked
this
question
many
times
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
other
places,
the
difficulty
there
is,
and
what
the
eleventh
circuit
addressed
was,
that
the
defendant
is
somehow
trying
to,
if
you
will,
according
to
the
eleventh
circuit
language,
have
his
cake
and
eat
it
too.
he
asks
back
then,
hey,
don't
consider
this
pending
charge,
and
now
he
says
you
can't
consider
it.
the
conduct
predated
my
first
sentencing,
and
if
you
wanted
to
consider
it
you
should
have
done
it
back
then.
that's
the
argument
that
i've
been
faced
a
number
of
times.
i
think
that
the
problem
with
that
argument,
and
i'm
taking
it
a
little
bit
out
of
order
now,
but
i'll
address
it
now,
the
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
argument
forgets
there
is
another
judge
waiting
in
the
wings
fully
able
to
take
that
into
account,
in
this
case,
and
that
if
you
will
allow
me
to
just
develop
the
facts
a
little
further
i'll
show
you
that
judge
davis,
the
judge
in
the,
what
was
the
mail
fraud
case
and
what
ended
up
being
a
misdemeanor
case,
did
have
the
opportunity
to
sentence
wasman
on
those
facts,
and
in
fact
judge
davis
announced
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
considered
the
other
case,
the
judge
roettger
case.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
no.
it
depends
upon
the
facts.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--that's
right.
but...
it
wasn't
a
mail
fraud.
it
was
a
misdemeanor
case
that
was
the
result
of
the
mail
fraud.
but
judge
davis
considered
that.
as
i
said,
i
was
jumping
ahead
a
bit,
but--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--yes.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
not
at
all.
the
difference
here
is
that
pearce
sets
out
that
in
a
situation
like
this
at
a
second
sentencing,
when
a
judge
wants
to
enhance
a
sentence
over
that
he
previously
had
given,
he
can't
consider
conduct
that
predated
the
first
sentence.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
not
at
all.
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
that
impression.
you
know,
when
i
was
answering
chief
justice
burger's
question,
was
that
if
judge
roettger
cannot
take
it
into
account
the
second
time
and
the
first
time.
i'm
just
saying
judge
davis
did
take
into
consideration
the
conviction.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
no,
no.
maybe
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
when
judge
davis
considered
it,
it
answers
the
question
that
the
defendant
is
trying
to
skate
through
without
the
mail
fraud
case
ever
being
considered.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
except
for
the
fact--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--except
for
the
fact
that
under
pearce
at
the
first
go-around
for
judge
roettger
he
chose
not
to
consider
it,
and
again
i
readily
concede
i
think
that
he
was
right
in
choosing
not
to
consider
it
at
that
time.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
because
it
had
not...
because
it
had
not
ripened
into
a
conviction.
it
was
a
pending
charge.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well,
we
are
talking
about
in
this
particular
case
the
language
in
pearce
and
when
that
conduct
occurred.
the
conduct
occurred
five
or
six
years
earlier.
i
read
pearce
to
say
that
due
process
requires
that
a
defendant
when
he
decides
whether
to
take
an
appeal
or
not
should
be
free
of
the
apprehension
that
a
judge
is
going
to
be
vindictive
against
him,
and
those
court
chose
to
put
forth
a
rule
to
carry
out
that
belief
by
saying--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--pearce
had
a
two-pronged
holding,
or
two-pronged
reason
for
its
test:
one,
that
we
want
to
keep
judges
from
being
vindictive;
and,
two,
we
want
defendants
who
when
choosing
to
take
an
appeal
should
not
be
fearful
of
a
judge
coming
back
and
being
vindictive
against
him.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
i
don't
think
i
necessarily
have
to
see
the
vindictiveness.
i
think
this
ccurt's
pointed
out
in
blackledge
v.
perry
and
other
cases
that,
number
one,
it's
high
on
to
impossible
for
a
defendant
to
ever
show
in
the
record
that
a
judge
was
vindictive
against
him.
i
don't
think
we're
ever
going
to
see
a
case
where
a
judge
says
i'm
going
to
enhance
your
sentence
because
you
took
it
up
on
appeal
and
beat
me.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
it
depends
on--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--when
the
conduct
that
gave
rise--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--under
the
prophylactic
rule
in
pearce,
yes.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
that's
true,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
misses
the
point
that
the
defendant
is
not
escaping
punishment.
other
judges
who
have--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--okay.
you're
assuming
that
the
rap
sheet
was
incorrect.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
the
prophylactic...
well--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--i
read
pearce--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--i
certainly
think
he
could.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
getting
back
to
the
reason
behind
the
rule
set
out
in
pearce,
the
reason,
as
this
court
enunciated
in
pearce
and
in
prior...
in
subsequent
opinions
from
pearce
was
to
take
fear
of
vindictiveness
out
of
the
defendant's
mind
when
he
chooses
whether
he
should
take
an
appeal
or
not.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
whatever
happens,
whatever
he
does.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
the
way
i
read
pearce
is
essentially
it
puts
the
ball,
so
to
speak,
in
the
defendant's
lap.
the
defendant
is
able
after
the
first
conviction
to
know
that
if
he
commits
no
more
bad
acts
he
knows
what's
going
to
happen.
if
he
commits
some
future
bad
act,
he
knows
what's
going
to
happen,
too,
and
it's
going
to
be
just
the
opposite
of
what
he
wants.
it
puts
the
ball
in
his
court,
so
to
speak.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
it
certainly
is
an
event.
the
question
is
is
it
conduct
on
his
part.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well,
we
come
right
down
to
the
meaning
of--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--we
come
right
down
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"conduct"
in
pearce.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well,
if
you'll...
in
the
case,
in
the
recent
case
in
this
court
of
united
states
v.
goodwin,
the
court
pointed
out
how
difficult
it
is
to
prove
vindictiveness.
there's
all
kinds
of
subconscious
motivations
on
the
part
of
judges,
lawyers
in
going
back
and
doing
something
again
and
trying
a
case
again,
and
it
is
virtually...
it
would
be
virtually
impossible.
i
think
this
court
in
blackledge
recognized
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
a
defendant
to
be
able
to
prove
actual
vindictiveness
on
the
part
of
a
trial
judge.
i
don't
think
any
trial
judge
is
going
to
say,
like
i
said
before,
on
the
record
i'm
enhancing
your
sentence
because
i
didn't
like
you
taking
the
appeal
the
first
time
around.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--yes,
with
a
qualification
to
your
question.
the
qualification
is
that
the
judge
who
sentenced
him
on
that
other
conviction
for
facts
that
were
unknown
has
sentenced
him
and
is
very
able
to
consider
the
pending
conviction
in
sentencing
and
to
allow
the,
in
this
case
for
simplicity,
to
allow
judge
roettger
at
the
second
sentencing
to
consider
it
again
is
in
essence
pyramiding
the
sentences
because
the
judge
x
in
the
middle
has
said
i
am
sentencing
you
on
this
conduct
and
also,
by
the
way,
you
are
convicted
of
obtaining
a
passport
using
a
false
name
and
i'm
considering
that
in
arriving
at
an
appropriate
sentence
for
you.
and
then
to
allow
judge
roettger
down
the
road
a
piece
to
say
i'm
going
to
enhance
your
sentence
over
that
which
i
gave
before--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--well,
i
think
it's
an
improper
pyramiding.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
either
one
of
them
could.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
they
could.
they
certainly
could.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
well,
when
i
raised
that
before,
justice
rehnquist,
was
in
response
to
the
question
about
his
having
his
cake
and
eating
it,
too.
i
think
that
in
your
fact
situation
that
you
just
posed
either
or
both
judge
could
take
into
account
the
other
conviction.
in
our
situation,
the
argument
is
well,
wasman,
back
the
first
time
before
judge
roettger
you
say
he
can't
consider,
don't
consider
the
pending
indictment,
and
then
the
second
time
around
you
can't
consider
it
because
it's
subsequent,
it's
predating
the
first
indictment,
and
the
result
of
that
being,
the
argument
being
what
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
is
saying,
that
wasman's
trying
to
have
his
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
that's
not
true.
he
was
before
judge
davis.
judge
davis
was
able
and
did
consider
both
convictions.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
no,
i
think
that
certainly
judge
roettger
had
a
right
to
consider
it
the
first
time
around.
the
second
time
i'm
saying
that
the...
and,
of
course,
that's
basically
what
we're
here
for,
because
i
think
that
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
as
to
how
to
interpret
the
language
"subsequent
conduct"
as
written
in
pearce,
because
the
second
and
ninth
circuit
interprets
the
language
that
if
the
conduct...
if
the,
let's
not
use
the
word
"conduct"...
if
the
action
of
the
defendant,
if
he
does
something
and
what
he
does
predates
the
first
sentencing,
then,
and
the
judge
doesn't
consider
it,
then
it's
out
for
all
times.
that's
what
the
language
of
the...
that's
the
interpretation
given
to
the
subsequent
conduct
language
in
pearce,
given
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
markus
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
williams
case.
the
eleventh
circuit
in
wasman
chose
to
read
pearce
and
conduct
differently,
and
i
would
venture
to
say
i
believe
that's
why
we're
in
this
courtroom
today.
i
read
pearce
in
a
line
along
with
the
second
and
ninth
circuits,
for
the
reason
that
i
think
that
the
pearce
test
was
formulated
to
take
this
fear
of
vindictiveness
out
of
the
mind
of
the
defendant
and
to
allow
the
defendant
when
he
chooses
to
appeal
or
not
to
know
that
the
ball
is
in
his
lap.
in
this
case,
taking
a
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case,
all
that
wasman
essentially
did
between
the
time
of
the
first
and
second
sentencing
hearings
was
go
home,
fold
his
hands
and
sit
there
for
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years,
except
one
day
go
to
court
and
have
the
mail
fraud
case
reduced
to
a
misdemeanor
and
have
him
enter
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
for
that
charge,
and
be
sentenced.
that's
all
he
did
in
the
total
time
period.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
in
the,
what
was
originally
the
mail
fraud
case,
yes,
he
was.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
that's
correct.
and
at
the
nolo
plea
judge
davis
asked
the
government
if
the
facts
of
the
two
cases
are
somewhat...
are
intertwined
at
all,
and
the
government
acknowledged
that
they
were
intertwined.
it's
a
very
intricate
fact
situation
that
is,
as
judge
roettger
once
observed,
is
better
than
an
ian
fleming
novel.
but
at
the
time
of
the
davis
sentence,
davis
announced
that
i
am
going
to...
i
understand
the
facts
are
interrelated
and
i
know
you
have
judge
roettger's
sentence
ahead
of
you,
and
then
passed
sentence
upon
him.
you
asked,
chief
justice
burger,
earlier
where
the
vindictiveness
may
lie,
and
i
answered
that
question
by
saying
that
i
don't
think
you
can
ever
point
to
vindictiveness,
and
i
didn't--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--at
the
time,
no.
his
case
hadn't
gone
on
appeal
yet.
i...
reading
the...
and
it's
included
in
my
cert
petition,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
judge
roettger
when
he
enhanced
the
sentence,
and
reading
that,
as...
i
never
in
my
briefs
said
i
can
demonstrate
judge
roettger
is
vindictive.
i
certainly
think
that
what
appears
to
be
in
the
record
here
is
that
judge
roettger
was
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence
imposed
by
judge
davis.
judge
davis
gave
him
probation
on
the
misdemeanor
case,
and
enhanced
the
sentence.
i
think
there
is
some
kind
of
a
vindictiveness
or
subconscious
vindictiveness
running
through
here.
i
don't
think
i...
i
cannot.
i
cannot
go
to
any
page
in
the
record
and
point
to
a
place
where
judge
roettger
is
being
vindictive
or
saying
he's
being
vindictive.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
no.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
i
don't
think
it
makes
that
much...
this
is
more
than
just
a
nolo
plea.
if
you
read
the
record,
it
was
a
nolo
plea
also
announcing
to
judge
davis
that
it's
given
under
the
case
of
north
carolina
v.
alford,
saying
that's
it.
i
have
had
enough,
said
wasman,
it's
over.
i
don't
think...
i
think
my
case
is
stronger
because
it's
a
nolo
plea.
i
don't
think
a
guilty
plea
would
change
my
argument.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
i
think
the
case
is--
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
--yes.
i
think
my
case...
the
fact
that
it
was
a
nolo
plea
makes
it
stronger,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
change
my
ultimate
argument.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
or
a
jury?
no,
same
thing.
i
see
the
white
light.
i'll
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
r.
moskowitz
a
couple
of
comments,
your
honor.
not
to
belabor
the
point,
but
i
think
that
pearce
talks
not
just
of
actual
vindictiveness.
it
also
talks
about
a
defendant's
state
of
mind
following
his
first
conviction,
a
state
of
mind
at
the
time
when
he
has
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
he
should
take--
pearce
says,
pearce
states
and
in
blackledge
v.
perry
it's
expounded
upon,
that
fear
of
vindictiveness
is
as
important
as
removing
vindictiveness
itself,
and
that
it
is
not
always
possible
and
not
always
required
that
a
defendant
actually
prove
vindictiveness
in
order
to
succeed.
one
of
the
things...
mr.
horowitz
laid
out
certain
hypotheticals
and
one
i
just
want
to
let
the
court
know
that
i'm
in
complete
agreement
with,
and
that
is
his
guilty
plea
situation,
that
a
man
enters
a
guilty
plea,
withdraws
it,
then
goes
to
trial
and
is
convicted.
in-between
the
time
of
his
first
sentencing
on
the
guilty
plea
and
the
second
sentencing
on
the
conviction,
something
else
happens.
i
find
the
guilty
plea
situation
withdrawn
or
overturned
on
some
kind
of
an
appeal
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
withdrawal
of
a
plea
bargain,
and
certainly
a
judge
who
may
have
been
lenient
the
first
time
around
can
give
whatever
sentence
the
judge
thinks
appropriate
the
second
time
around.
that
really,
i
don't
think,
falls
within
the
line
that
i've
been
arguing.
mr.
horowitz
also
commented
about
on
the
ninth
circuit
case
the
williams
case
about
the
man
convict...
the
man
who
was...
the
intervening
act
was
a
murder.
i
am
not
here
standing
here
saying
that
my
client
or
that
williams
or
that
markus
or
anybody
else
should
escape
punishment
on
the
murder,
on
the
misdemeanor
false
certificates
case
or
any
other
case.
i'm
just
saying
that
under
the
guidance
and
guidelines
of
pearce
the
punishment
should
not
be
enhanced
based
on
previous
conduct.
it
seems
that
we're
really
talking
here
about
a
fortuitous
event
in
the
wasman
situation,
the
fortuitous
event
being
that
wasman
resolved
the
mail
fraud
case
prior
to
the
second
trial
and
second
conviction
in
the
passport
case.
had
the
mail
fraud
case,
which
was
resolved
in
a
negotiated
settlement,
have
occurred
subsequent
to
the
retrial
and
reconviction
in
the
passport
case,
we
obviously
would
not
be
standing
here
today,
because
judge
roettger
obviously
could
not
have
and
would
not
have
taken
it
into
account
the
second
time
around.
and
i
think
that
that
fortuitous
events
should
not
dictate
how
we
rule,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
not
send
the
case
back
but
just
send
the
case
back
for
resentencing
in
this
case.
