ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
single
issue
before
the
court
this
afternoon
is
whether
or
not
edgefield
county,
south
carolina,
with
respect
to
its
county
council,
is
in
compliance
with
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
this
is
not
a
section
2
issue
and
this
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
this
is
whether
or
not
section
5
has
been
complied
with.
and,
with
respect
to
that
issue,
we
have
three
points
which
we
would
like
to
address.
number
one,
the
1971
act
prescribed
the
current
method
of
electing
the
edgefield
county
council
today.
there
has
been
no
change
since
1971.
number
two,
the
'71
act
was
precleared
in
its
entirety;
that
is
all
of
its
provisions,
the
five-member
council,
the
five
residency
districts,
the
at-large
method
and
the
two
year
term
were
all
contained
in
the
'71
act
and
they
were
all
precleared
in
1971.
and,
number
three,
the
home
rule
changes,
if
they
are
section
5
changes
at
all,
were
precleared
on
august
28,
1975
when
the
attorney
general
precleared
the
home
rule
act.
now,
the
lower
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
preclearance
of
the
1971
act
precleared
that
act
in
its
entirety
and
we
submit
that
that
finding
is
not
only
clearly
erroneous
as
it
must
be
to
be
reversed,
but
it
is
immanently
correct
that
there
was
in
fact
and
by
operation
of
law
a
preclearance
of
the
'71
act
in
its
entirety.
the
'71
act
begins
by
striking
out
all
of
the
election
provisions
of
the
1966
act
and
that
is
important,
we
think,
because
the
'71
act
specifically
says
the
section
of
the
'66
act
which
relates
to
method
of
election
is
hereby...
is
amended
by
striking
it
out
and
placing
it
with
the
following.
it
replaces
the
'66
act
with
provisions
which
add
two
members
so
that
they
now
have
a
five-member
county
council.
it
changes
all
of
the
residency
districts.
there
had
been
three.
it
adds
two
and
changes
the
composition
of
all
five.
it
provides
once
again
for
an
at-large
method
of
elections
and
for
two-year
terms.
it
was
submitted
along
with
17
other
pieces
of
legislation
and
the
submission
says
simply
this:
"that
in
accordance
with
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
there
are
submitted
herewith
copies
of
the
following
acts.
"
and
the
1971
act
is
one
of
them.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
the
next
act
that
took
place
was
that
the
attorney
general
wrote
to
edgefield
county
and
said
that
he
needed
additional
information.
he
needed
boundary
maps,
he
needed
voter
registration
statistics,
he
needed
population
statistics,
and
he
also
needed
the
election
provisions
now
in
force.
that
requested
was
acted
upon
and
he
received
all
that
he
asked
for
including
a
copy
of
the
1966
act.
his
next
action
was
not
to
ask
what
was
in
effect
on
november
1,
1964
or
was
1966
precleared,
but
his
next
act
was
to
preclear
the
1971
act.
and,
his
preclearance
letter
says
simply,
"the
attorney
general
does
not
interpose
any
objection
to
the
change
in
question.
"
that
is
the
enactment
itself
at
no.
521
of
1971.
in
other
words,
as
this
letter
manifests,
he
precleared
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
1971
act.
perhaps
more
important--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
it
definitely
was.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
our
position
is
it
was
superseded
by
the
1971
act
because
the
1971
act
provides
completely
for
the
method
of
electing
edgefield
county
council.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
we
don't
contend
that
it
reached
back
or...
yes,
reached
back
and
cleared
the
'66--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
and,
we
think--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--because
of...
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
because
of
the
way
the
statute
is
phrased,
the
fact
that
the
'66
act
is
completely
struck
out,
we
think
that
it
might
have
been
different
if
the
'71
act
had
said
line
3
of
the
'66
act
is
amended
from
three
to
five
and
something
like
that.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
we
were,
back
then
in
the
early
years
of
the
voting
rights
act,
and
it
was
not
too
long
after
the
watershed
case
of
allen,
and
i
think
if
we...
i
don't
know
that
we
even
need
to
compare
duties,
but
i
think
the
attorney
general
being
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
voting
rights
act
probably
has
more
knowledge
of
what
it
that
was
a
voting
change
than
edgefield
county
did
at
that
time.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
for
this
reason,
and
this
is
what
i
am
getting
into
and
that
is
we
think
that
'71
act
precleared
the
present
method
of
electing
edgefield
county
council
by
operation
of
law
as
well
as
in
fact.
the
plaintiff
emphasized
that
he
had
only
the
1966
act
before
him.
we
don't
know
what
he
had
before
him.
we
know
he
had
at
least
the
information
that
was
requested
and
we
know
that
he
had
the
'66
act.
but,
we
do
know
that
he
did
not
have
any
authority
to
stop
at
the
'66
act
unless
it
had
been
precleared
and
we
do
know
that
he
was
required
to
under
section
5,
compare
it
to
november
1st
of
'64.
we
also
know
that
he
was
authorized
to
review
the
pre-existing
elements,
even
assuming
that
they
had
been
precleared,
the
at-large
and
the
two-year
term
under
lockhart,
and
could
have
objected
to
those
pre-existing
elements
in
the
context
of
the
'71
changes.
and,
most
important,
we
know
that
we
must
presume
that
he
followed
the
law,
that
is
that
he
acted
within
his
authority.
the
plaintiffs
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
knew
was
at
force
on
november
1st
of
'64
and
we
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
didn't
know
what
was
in
force
on
november--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--no,
your
honor,
it
hasn't
been.
it
was
submitted
in
response
to
his
request
for
the
present
method
of
election
in
1971.
we,
of
course,
contend
that
that
has
been
moot
ever
since
1971,
the
'66
statute.
the
presumption--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no,
your
honor,
we
think
we
have
presented
the
present
method
of
election
in
edgefield
county
for
preclearance
in
1971
and
that
it
was
precleared
in
1971
and
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
last
12
years.
this
presumption
that
he
acted
within
his
authority,
that
he
did
the
only
thing
he
was
allowed
to
do,
which
was
to
compare
it
to
november
1st
of
'64,
coupled
with
no
evidence
to
rebut
it,
we
think,
makes
it
conclusive.
but,
we
have
even
more
information
and
that
is
in
his
letter
in
which
he
requests
additional
information,
he
discusses
the
other
16
statutes
that
were
sent
in
with
this
'71
act
and
he
says
with
respects
to
those
16,
they
do
not
represent
a
change
in
voting
practice
or
procedure
from
november
1st
of
'64.
so,
we
know
that
he
knew
that
november
1st
of
'64
is
a
determinative
date
and
we
have
no
evidence
to
show
that
he
treated
the
edgefield
county
act
any
differently
from
the
way
he
treated
the
companion
statute.
while
we
have
the
burden
to
submit
and
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that,
the
attorney
general,
once
he
has
a
submission
before
and
the
duty
to
either
object
to
it
or
to
preclear
it
and
once--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--we
submitted
the
present
method
of
electing
the
edgefield
county
council.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
that
is
correct.
and,
that
issue--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
am
not
including
'66.
when
we
submitted
the
1971
act,
he
had
the
duty
either
to
object
or
to
preclear
it
and
once
he
precleared
it
we
are
entitled
to
rely
on
that
preclearance,
we
feel,
without
having
to
ask
him
did
you
compare
it
do
1964,
did
you
preclear
everything,
does
your
letter
mean
what
it
says
and
did
you
do
your
job?
whether
that
preclearance
was
correct
or
not,
once
it
was
precleared,
it
was
precleared,
and,
otherwise,
as
this
court
has
observed,
the
preclearance
mechanism
might
never
come
to
an
end
and
otherwise
the
sufficiency
of
a
submission
might
always
be
subject
to
challenge
as
it
is
here
12
years
after
we
received
preclearance.
now,
the
attorney
general
in
1980
for
the
first
time
requested
the
submission
of
the
1966
act.
and,
the
plaintiffs
say
that
this
represents
a
consistent
position
of
non-preclearance
and
that
it
is
entitled
to
deference.
we
say
that
for
nine
years
and
through
two
submissions
the
attorney
general
assumed
that
the
edgefield
county
method
of
election
had
been
precleared
as
prescribed
under
the
1971
act.
first
of
all,
in
1971,
when
he
had
the
'66
act
in
front
of
him
and
must
have
seen
either
that
it
hadn't
been
precleared
or
if
it
hadn't
been
precleared,
that
it
had,
in
fact,
been
superseded
entirely
by
the
'71
act--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--yes,
your
honor.
and,
we
think
when
he
had
the
'66
statute
in
front
of
him,
he
either
saw
that
it
had
been
precleared,
which
the
record
says
that
he
did
not
do,
that
it
had
not
been
precleared,
and
there
is
no
record
to
show
that
it
had
been,
or
he
saw
that
it
had
been
completely
superseded
by
the
'71
act
and
proceeded
to
compare
all
features
of
the
'71
act
with
november
1,
1964.
that
was
his
first
opportunity.
then
in
1979,
when
he
objected
to
the
home
rule
ordinance
and
resolution
which
merely
continues
this
'71
method
of
election,
he
began
his
objection
letter
by
saying
ostensibly
this
is
the
same
system
of
election.
now,
that
wouldn't
have
been
relevant
if
he
hadn't
assumed
that
the
same
system
of
election
had
been
precleared.
"there
is
to
be
no
dragging
out
of
this
extraordinary
federal
remedy.
"
and,
as
the
court
in
us
v.
georgia
found
an
11-year
delay
as
inexcusable,
we
think
that
this
late
attempt,
12
years
after
preclearance
has
been
obtained,
is
also
inexcusable.
now,
the
case
should
stop
here
because
we
have
a
'71
preclearance,
we
have
a
stipulated
fact
that
the
method
of
election
has
remained
the
same
since
1971,
and
we
have
cases
and
the
attorney
general's
own
regulations
saying
that
a
failure
to
object
for
any
reason
is
not
reviewable.
and,
the
case,
as
i
say,
should
stop
there.
however,
the
plaintiffs'
second
issue
is
that
the
home
rule
act
effected
changes
which
require
a
submission
of
edgefield
county's
ordinance
and
resolution,
which,
as
i
mentioned,
continue
unchanged
the
'71
method
of
election.
the
only
change
effected
by
the
home
rule
act
is
in
power.
it
expanded
the
powers
of
all
south
carolina
counties.
the
plaintiffs
again
stipulate
that
the
home
rule
act
has
only
changed
the
powers;
that
is
that
the
method
of
election
has
remained
unchanged
by
the
home
rule
act.
and,
the
attorney
general
really,
in
his
letter
of
objection,
appears
to
agree
with
it,
because
again
he
says
ostensibly
this
is
the
same
system
of
election.
in
other
words,
the
home
rule
act
has
not
changed
the
method
of
election.
edgefield
county
assumed
these
new
powers,
these
expanded
powers,
as
of
july
1,
1976,
and
it
assumed
the
powers
pursuant
to
the
home
rule
act,
which
was
precleared
in
august
of
'75
and
the
lower
court
so
held.
the
lower
court
relied
on
a
decision
from
our
local
three-judge
court
concerning
charleston
county
which
was
in
the
exact
same
situation.
it
had
a
pre-home
rule
method
of
election
which
had
been
precleared
and
it
continued
that
under
home
rule
and
the
decision,
woods
versus
hamilton,
held
that
if
a
south
carolina
county
kept
its
method
of
election
unchanged
by
home
rule,
then
it
would
not
need
to
submit
its
implementing
ordinance
which
merely
readopts
that
method
of
election.
the
attorney
general
was
a
party
to
that
law
suit
and
that
decision
was
not
appealed.
and,
even
as
recently
as
this
year,
the
attorney
general
took
the
same
position
in
the
case
that
is
now
pending
in
the
d.c.
district
court
involving
sumter
county
in
which
the
defendant
attorney
general
urged
the
court
to
find
that
the
preclearance
of
the
home
rule
act
precleared
only
the
right
provisions
which
were
the
holding
of
the
referenda
and
the
expansion
of
the
powers.
the
ordinance
and
the
resolution
itself,
and
they
are
found
in
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
183,
do
not
mention
powers
and
they
do
not
change
the
method
of
election.
they
simply
continue
the
method
of
election.
again,
the
lower
court
so
held.
significantly,
we
think
the
attorney
general's
objection
letter
notes
its
rather
uncertain
jurisdiction.
first,
by
beginning
and
saying
ostensibly
this
is
the
same
system
of
election.
it
later
says
that
while
the
formal
structure
has
remained
the
same,
it
then
characterizes
its
home
rule
preclearance
as
being
beyond
recall
and
if
the
home
rule
act
had
been
something
other
than
what
was
represented
to
us
we
might
not
have
precleared
it.
it
is
a
very
uncertain
type
of
objection
letter.
but,
nevertheless,
edgefield
county
did
make
a
good
faith
attempt
to
comply
with
it
and
as
the
record
reflects
it
set
up
public
hearings,
it
established
a
committee
to
draft
single-member
districts,
and
then
the
woods
versus
hamilton
decision
came,
which
said
if
you
are
a
south
carolina
county
and
make
no
change
in
your
method
of
election,
you
don't
need
to
submit
your
ordinance
and
resolution,
and,
again,
the
attorney
general
did
not
appeal
that.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm,
of
course,
on
both
of
the
issues,
but
particularly
with
respect
to
the
second
issue;
that
is
that
the
home
rule
changes,
if
they
were
changes
under
section
5,
have
been
precleared.
consider
the
effect
of
the
implicit
holding
of
the
lower
court
which
is
that
they
were,
in
fact,
section
5
changes
or
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
be
precleared.
we
think
that
before
the
court
expands
the
voting
rights
act
into
a
non-election
law;
that
is
simply
an
expansion
of
powers,
that
it
should
consider
the
language
of
the
act
itself,
its
own
previous
decisions,
and
particularly
the
city
of
lockhart
decision
where
just
recently
the
court
said
it
had
the
entire
election
system
in
front
of
it
and
could
determine
the
pre-existing...
the
constitutionality
of
the
pre-existing
elements
as
well
as
the
changes,
but
never
once
talked
about
the
fact
that
it
went
from
a
general
law
city
to
a
home
rule
city;
that
is
a
change
in
power.
accordingly,
despite
the
second
non-issue
that
we
think
the
plaintiffs
have
raised
with
respect
to
the
home
rule
act,
we
end
with
the
identical
issue
that
we
began
with;
that
is
the
1971
act
prescribes
a
current
method
of
election.
it
was
precleared
in
its
entirety
in
1971.
to
reverse
the
lower
court,
we
think,
would
signal
at
least
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
the
sufficiency
of
a
submission
is
always
subject
to
challenge,
even
12
years
after
preclearance
was
obtained
and
despite
the
60-day
language
in
the
act,
and
we
think
the
second
thing
it
would
signal
is
non-election
changes;
that
is
something
like
the
expansion
of
powers
is
subject
to
preclearance.
but,
if
the
court
affirms,
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
signal
at
least
two
things.
first,
that
once
a
covered
jurisdiction
complies
with
the
voting
rights
act,
that
the
integrity
of
its
state
and
local
legislation
will
remain
undisturbed;
and,
second,
that
the
preclearance
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
are
to
be
limited
to
their
intended
scope.
and,
all
of
this
is
not
to
leave
the
plaintiffs
without
a
remedy,
because
pending
in
this
very
lawsuit
is
a
section
2
issue,
a
constitutional
issue,
and
a
1983
issue,
which,
of
course,
go
to
the
merits
of
the
present
method
of
election.
the
plaintiffs
also
have,
under
our
state
law,
a
political
remedy,
because
our
home
rule
act
now
allows
ten
percent
of
the
registered
voters
of
any
county
to
petition
for
a
referendum
to
change
to
the
single-member
district.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no,
your
honor,
that
isn't
our
position.
well,
it
sounds
like
it.
do
you
mean
isn't
the
submitter
supposed
to
go
on
and
say
here
is
what
we
want
cleared?
yes,
your
honor.
and
those
are
what
the
regulations
require
which,
of
course,
were
not
in
effect
in
1971.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
i
think
in
1971,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no.
i
think
it--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--well,
we
were
supposed
to
submit
it,
which
we
did.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
it
was
an
act.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
okay.
we
submitted
the
act.
now,
in
the
absence
of
any
regulations,
the
attorney
general
then
wrote
back
and
said
we
don't
have
sufficient
data
and
here
is
what
we
need
in
order
to
have
sufficient
data.
he
did
not
ask
us
what
changes
do
you
want
precleared
and,
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
we
would
have
said.
we
probably
would
have
said--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--no.
we
said
preclear
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no.
no,
your
honor,
we
sent
the
act
in
and
then
the
next
thing
that
the
attorney
general
did
was
to
request
the
additional
information
that
he
needed
in
order
to
make
an
evaluation.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
i
imagine
so.
and,
i
think
the
one
thing
that
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
really
is
that
we
were
dealing
with
the
early
years
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
really
what
this
case
involved
is
going
back
to
the
pre-allen
days
where
perhaps
mistakes
were
made
by
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
perhaps
mistakes
were
made
by
the
attorney
general
himself
and
at
this
late
date,
12
years
later,
to
try
to
reconstruct
what
we
meant
when
we
sent
it
in
and
what
he
meant
when
he
precleared
it,
we
think,
points
out
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
do
it,
first
of
all,
and
also
points
up
the
reason
why
the
60-day
deadline
is
in
effect
and
also
points
out
the
reason
why
the
section
5
preclearance
is
not
the
only
remedy
available
to--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--he
precleared
the
'71
act,
your
honor--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--he
precleared
every
provision
of
the
1971
act
when
he
precleared
the
1971
act.
and,
at
that
time,
the
'66
issue
became
moot,
because
the
'71
act
provided
once
again
for
at-large
and
provided
once
again
for
all
of
the
features
of
the
present
method
of
election.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
the
record
reflects
we
have
never
submitted
the
'66
act.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
he
precleared--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--your
honor,
that
issue
became
moot
when
in
1971
the
'66
act
was
amended
by
striking
out
all
of
the
election
provisions,
replacing
them
with
new
election
provisions,
and
that
was
precleared.
we
think
the
issue
as
to
the
'66
act
has
been
moot
since
1971.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
well,
as
i
have
said--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--it
is
mooted
out
by
the
'71
act.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
we
do
not
maintain
that
it
was
ever
submitted
and
we
also--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
the
'71...
both
the
'71
act
and
the
'66
act
provide
for
at-large
and
for
two-year
terms
of
office.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
and
all
five
districts
were
changed.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
it
struck
out
the
'66
act
and
replaced
it
with
the
present
method
of
electing
the
edgefield
county
council.
some
of
the
features
were
the
same
as
the
'66
act
and
some
of
them
were
new.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
the
1979
objection
to
the
ordinance
and
resolution
states
that
the
new
powers
assumed
by
the
edgefield
county
council
in
the
context
of
at-large
has
the
potential
for
diluting
the
black
vote.
so,
they
isolate
the
at-large
feature
in
conjunction
with
the
expanded
powers.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
prior
to
'66
there
was
an
appointed--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--oh,
goodness,
i
think
that
goes
way
back
into
the--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--no,
he
didn't.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
well,
we
think
under...
by
operation
of
law--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--that
is
right.
so,
we
don't
know...
we
don't
know
how
he
knew
it,
but
we
know
by
operation
of
law
he
had
to
know
it,
because
he
had
to
compare
it
to--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--well,
he
could
only
stop
at
the
'66
act
if
it
had
been
precleared,
because
the
determinative
date
is
november
1st
of
'64.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
that
is
right,
but
when
he
precleared
the
'71
act,
he
had
the
authority
to
look
at
all
of
them.
and,
if
he
had
found
at-large
objectionable,
he
could
have
objected
to
it
in
'71
if
it
had
been
instituted
in
1930.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
no,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
plaintiffs
argue
and
i
think
that
that
couldn't...
what
they
argue
is
you
could
conceivable
pass
a
blatantly
discriminatory
change,
not
preclear
it,
amend
it,
send
the
amendment
in--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--right.
and,
if
it
is
not
retrogressive
from
the
blatantly
discriminatory,
then
it
would
have
to
be
precleared.
first
of
all,
under
lockhart,
he
does
look
at
all
the
pre-existing
elements,
so
he
would
look
at
that--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--your
honor,
i
think
that
under
today's
regulations
and
under
today's
standards
of
submission,
we...
he
also
can
send
back
the
submission
and
say
follow
our
regulations.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
yes.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
we
win
on
the
section
5,
but,
of
course--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--that
is
right.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
the
attorney
general?
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
that
is
right.
and
i
think
that
once
the
60
days
go
by
and
once
he
has
failed
to
object,
for
whatever
reason,
whether
it
is
under
a
mistake
of
law
or
a
mistake
of
fact,
then
the
court
has
held
in
morris
v.
gressette
that
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
but
that
doesn't
leave
an
unconstitutional
change
unchallengeable
because
you
have
still
got
section
2
and
you
have
still
got
the
constitutional
challenge
or
a
1983
challenge,
all
of
which
are
still
pending
in
this
case.
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
in
the
remaining
issues?
the
dilution
order
that
mr.
mcdonald
alluded
to
was
vacated
after
the
bolden
decision,
and
pending
now
is
a
real
hearing
on
intent,
so
that
if
they
can
show
that
the
at-large
method
of
election
has
been
put
in
place
intentionally--
ms.
karen
lecraft
henderson
--your
honor,
there
is
relief,
and
there
is
relief
that...
which
is
what
i
was
talking
about
before...
there
is
relief
provided
by
state
law,
and
that
is
the
petition
to
change
the
method
of
election
to
single-member
district
by
a
referendum,
and
that
takes
merely
a
10
percent
petition,
and
the
black
voters
of
edgefield
county,
according
to
the
latest
statistics,
comprise
44
percent
of
the
elected
voters.
there
is
also
a
1983
issue
pending,
and
it
is
possible
that
they
could
prevail
on
that
or
on
a
14th
amendment
argument.
to
conclude,
we
feel
that
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
stated
today,
as
well
as
those
that
are
contained
in
the
brief,
we
would
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court.
