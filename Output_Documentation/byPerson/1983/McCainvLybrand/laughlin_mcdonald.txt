mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1964,
edgefield
county,
south
carolina,
one
of
the
jurisdictions
covered
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act,
had
an
appointed
system
of
local
government
consisting
of
two
commissioners
who
were
appointed
by
the
governor
from
the
recommendation
of
the
local
legislative
delegation,
and
an
elected
county
supervisor.
the
critical
date
in
this
litigation
is
1966.
in
that
year
the
appointed
commission
form
of
government
was
abolished
and
was
replaced
by
a
three-member
county
council
elected
for
the
first
time
at
large
from
residency
districts.
although
the
1966
legislation
was
a
voting
change
subject
to
preclearance,
it
was
never
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
nor
was
it
ever
the
subject
of
declaratory
judgment
proceedings
in
the
d.c.
courts.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
the
1966
change
instituted
a
three-member
elected,
at-large
county
council
with
additional
home
rule
powers.
the
prior
local
governing
body
had
been
an
appointed
commission
form
of
government,
two
commissioners
appointed
by
the
governor
and
then
the
third
member
of
the
commission
was
a
county
supervisor.
that
voting
change
in
1966
was
never
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
and
as
a
consequence
at-large
elections
have
been
used
illegally
in
edgefield
county
and
have
not
been
evaluated
by
any
person,
neither
the
attorney
general
nor
the
d.c.
courts,
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
racially
discriminatory
and
their
undeniable
consequence
has
been
to
exclude
blacks
totally
from
membership
on
the
county
governing
body
throughout
the
use
of
those
unlawful,
unprecleared,
at-large
elections.
now,
despite
the
failure,
admitted
failure,
of
the
county
to
submit
to
the
1966
act,
the
lower
court
found
that
preclearance
was
unnecessary
because
the
attorney
general
had,
so
the
court
found,
in
fact,
precleared
the
1966
act
when
he
precleared
a
change
in
1971
involving
an
increase
in
the
size
of
the
council
from
three
to
five
members
and
the
lower
court
held
alternatively
that
preclearance
of
the
1971
increase
in
size
as
a
matter
of
law
precleared
the
adoption
of
at-large
voting
in
1966.
the
appellants
in
this
case,
who
are
black
residents
of
edgefield
county,
submit
that
the
local...
the
lower
court
erred
on
both
counts.
first
of
all,
the
attorney
general
has
made
it
absolutely
clear,
both
in
correspondence
with
state
and
local
officials
and
also
in
briefs
filed
in
this
case
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
he
was
never
asked
in
the
1971
submission
involving
the
increase
in
size
of
the
council
to
evaluate
or
preclear
the
1966
adoption
of
at-large
voting.
the
attorney
general
has
also
made
it
clear
that
he
did
not,
in
fact,
evaluate
or
consider
the
1966
change
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
had
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
he
never
treated
the
1971
change
as
one
involving
the
adoption
in
1966,
of
a
change
from
an
appointed
to
an
elected
at-large
local
government,
and
that
the
1971
submission
was
not
a
submission
of
the
1966
act.
the
lower
court's
finding
that
the
attorney
general
1966
change
is
wholly
contradicted
by
the
record
and
by
the
representations
of
the
attorney
general.
he
simply
did
not
evaluate
the
change
made
in
1966
and
he
has
not
done
so
to
this
day
and
neither
has
the
d.c.
courts.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
i
think
if
a
belated
submission
had
been
made
and
if
the
jurisdiction
had
fully
complied
with
the
submission
requirements
that
the
court
has
set
out
in
allen
and
the
united
states
versus
board
of
commissioners
of
sheffield,
and
if
the
jurisdiction
had
made
a
specific,
though
late,
request
that
the
change
could
have
been
cleared.
but,
that
was
manifestly
not
done
here,
because
there
was
no
request
from
the
jurisdiction
in
1971
that
the
attorney
general
precleared
the
1966
change.
the
only
request...
i
think
the
record
is
unambiguous
on
this
point...
the
only
request
made
of
the
attorney
general
was
to
preclear
and
increase
in
size
of
the
council,
to
preclear
the
1971
change
and--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
--well,
there
was
nothing
ever
submitted
to--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
--well,
if
it
had
been
submitted
and
if
it
had
been
considered,
then
it
could
have
been
precleared,
but
it
was
not
submitted.
there
was
never
anything
ever
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
which
would
indicate
what
the
practice
was
in
1964.
there
is
simply
no
possible
way
the
attorney
general
could
have
known
other
than
that
he
was
pressured
or
was
able
to
devine
from
things
that
were
not
before
him.
the
lower
court
concluded
that
the
1971
preclearance
work
is
a
matter
of
law
to
preclear
the
1966
act,
but
with
all
respect,
that
could
not
have
been--
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
--which
i
believe
to
be
patently
erroneous
on
this
record.
but,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
in
order
to
make
a
submission
the
jurisdiction
has
got
to
do...
it
has
to
do
at
least
two
things.
i
has
to
make
a
submission.
and,
when
allen
talks
about
making
a
submission
and
sheffield
talks
about
making
a
submission,
i
take
it
to
mean
that
the
jurisdiction
has
got
to
submit
sufficient
information
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
make
the
kind
of
comparison
which
congress
had
said
he
or
she
must
make
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
now,
that
was
manifestly
not
done
here,
because
there
was
never
submitted
through
the
attorney
general
any
evidence
as
to
what
the
practice
in
edgefield
county
was
in
1964.
secondly,
not
only
does
the
jurisdiction
have
to
make
a
submission
of
evidence,
but
it
also
has
to
make
a
request
that
a
particular
change
be
precleared.
that,
again,
was
not
done
here.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
submitting
jurisdiction
ever
requested
that
the
1966
adoption
of
at-large
elections
be
precleared.
the
voting
rights
act
itself
doesn't
prescribe
any
formal
procedures,
as
you
know,
for
the
submission
of
voting
changes,
but
this
court
has
been
very
consistent
and
quite
explicit
in
allen
and
sheffield
and
in
city
of
rome
in
requiring
jurisdictions
to
make
a
sufficient
request
and,
secondly,
to
make
a
request
that
a
specific
change
be
precleared.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
critical
fact
in
this
case
is
that
neither
the
attorney
general
nor
the
d.c.
courts
have
ever
done,
with
respect
to
the
1966
adoption
of
at-large
elections
in
edgefield
county,
what
the
congress
said
and
what
this
court
has
said
must
be
done
and
that
is
they
must
be
evaluated
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
have
a
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
it
has
been
suggested
it
is
in
some
sense
unfair
to
the
jurisdiction
to
require
it
to
do
so.
i
think
nothing
could
be
further
off
the
mark.
if
the
change
is
one
that
is
not
discriminatory,
then
the
jurisdiction,
if
it
submits
the
'66
change,
will
have
it
precleared
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
the
section
5
issue.
they
will
be
out,
if
you
will,
a
postage
stamp
and
some
time
of
the
county
attorney.
if,
however,
the
change
is
one
that
is
discriminatory,
and
i
would
submit
that
one
cannot
read
the
opinion
of
the
single-judge
court,
the
1980
opinion
deciding
the
dilution
claim
in
this
case,
and
conclude
anything
other
than
that
the
at-large
system
has
the
most
aggravated
and
racially
discriminatory
impact
in
edgefield
county.
if,
indeed,
the
change
is
one
that
is
discriminatory,
i
think
no
one
could
defend
the
17-year
non-compliance
and
non-submission
by
the
local
jurisdiction.
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
did
everything,
we
submit,
that
he
was
requested
to
do
by
the
local
jurisdiction.
he
was
requested
to
preclear
a
change
involving
an
increase
in
the
size
of
the
council.
he
did
precisely
that.
he
did
exactly
what
the
congress
envisioned
that
he
would
do.
if
there
is
any
failure
to
comply
with
the
law,
it
most
clearly
is
the
failure
of
the
local
jurisdiction
to
comply
with
the
submission
requirements
of
section
5
and
submit
the
1966
act.
appellants
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
do
no
more
than
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
to
require
edgefield
county
to
submit
promptly
the
1964
change
to
at-large
elections
so
that
someone,
the
attorney
general
or
the
d.c.
courts
will
have
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
those
changes
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
have
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
mr.
laughlin
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further
unless
members
of
the
court
have
questions.
