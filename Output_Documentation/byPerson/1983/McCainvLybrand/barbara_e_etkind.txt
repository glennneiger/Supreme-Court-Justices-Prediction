ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
us
that
a
theme
underlying
both
the
decision
below
and
appellees'
argument
is
that
the
attorney
general
should
have
known
that
the
change
to
at-large
elections
was
involved
in
south
carolina's
1971,
submission,
because
that
notion
presents
great
potential
for
eroding
section
5
rights.
i
would
like
to
address
it
first.
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
congress
was
concerned
not
only
with
eliminating
existing
forms
of
voting
discrimination,
but
also
with
preventing
any
form
of
discrimination
local
jurisdiction
might
devise
in
the
future.
the
method
congress
choose
to
protect
against
new
forms
of
discriminations
was
to
require
each
covered
jurisdiction,
before
implementing
any
voting
change,
to
submit
it
for
scrutiny
by
an
independent
body.
congress
selected
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
this
independent
scrutiny.
this
right
of
minority
voters
to
be
free
from
voting
changes
that
have
not
been
found
to
be
nondiscriminatory
can
only
be
ensured
if
the
reviewing
bodies'
attention
is,
in
fact,
brought
to
bear
on
the
precise
change
in
question.
when
preclearance
is
sought
in
the
district
court,
that
focus
is
assured
by
the
requirement
that
the
jurisdiction
file
a
complaint
specifying
the
changes
it
wishes
to
have
precleared.
similarly,
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
jurisdiction
seeks
preclearance
by
the
attorney
general,
the
statute
requires
the
jurisdiction
to
state
unambiguously
the
changes
it
seeks
to
have
approved.
when
a
jurisdiction
fails
to
carry
that
burden,
preclearance
cannot
be
based
on
a
determination
that
the
attorney
general
should
have
known
that
the
change
required
preclearance.
such
a
result
defeats
the
right
afforded
by
section
5
which
is
the
right
to
actual
scrutiny
of
voting
changes
before
they
are
limited.
such
a
result
also
inures
who
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
voting
rights
act
are.
section
5
was
not
intended
to
benefit
the
attorney
general
or
the
local
jurisdiction,
but
rather
minority
voters
are
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
section
5.
accordingly,
this
is
not
a
contest
between
edgefield
county
and
the
attorney
general
in
which
the
county's
failure
to
make
an
unambiguous
submission
can
be
excused
by
some
purported
contributory
negligence
of
the
attorney
general.
for
reasons
i
shall
state,
we
dispute
that
the
attorney
general
was
negligent
in
his
preclearance
of
the
1971
submission.
but,
in
any
event,
his
role
under
the
statute
is
not
an
adversarial
one,
but
more
of
a
judicial
one.
hence,
in
the
absence
of
statutory
compliance
by
the
jurisdiction,
any
alleged
fault
by
the
attorney
general
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
act
so
as
to
defeat
their
rights.
the
requirement
that
a
jurisdiction
state
unambiguously
the
changes
it
wishes
to
have
precleared
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
section
5
scheme.
that
provision
requires
the
voluntary
submission
of
voting
changes
by
covered
jurisdictions
and
places
on
them
the
burden
of
proving
absence
of
discriminatory
purpose
or
effect.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
attorney
general
simply
does
not
have
the
resources
to
police
all
the
states
and
subdivisions
covered
by
the
act.
he
receives
thousands
of
section
5
submissions
each
year
and
the
statute
affords
him
only
60
days
in
which
to
act
on
them.
moreover,
as
this
court
has
also
emphasized,
the
attorney
general
cannot
be
charged
with
knowledge
of
all
the
nuances
of
local
law.
by
contrast,
the
submitting
jurisdiction
knows
exactly
which
changes
it
wants
to
clear
and
it
is
not
too
much
to
expect
that
it
state
those
changes
clearly
so
the
attorney
general
will
be
sure
to
focus
on
them
and,
thus,
bring
to
bear
the
scrutiny
that
minority
voters
are
entitled
to
under
the
act.
here,
it
cannot
be
seriously
claimed
that
appellees
or
south
carolina
ever
made
an
unambiguous
request
for
preclearance
of
the
change
to
at-large
election.
the
court
below
found
as
a
fact
that
south
carolina
did
not
submit
the
change
before
it
was
implemented
in
1966
and
it
is
strange
credulity
to
suggest
that
the
1971
submission
was
an
unambiguous
request
for
approval
of
the
prior
change.
the
only
changes
brought
about
by
the
'71
legislation,
as
mr.
mcdonald
said,
which
would
redistrict
edgefield
county
into
five
rather
than
three
districts
and
to
increase
the
number
of
council
members
from
three
to
five.
the
act
was
so
entitled
and
south
carolina
never
indicated
there
were
any
other
voting
changes
subject
to
the
preclearance
requirement,
much
less
requested
preclearance
of
them.
the
court
below
relied
on
the
fact
that
the
1971
legislation
contained
a
provision
for
at-large
elections,
but
the
attorney
general
knew
from
the
face
of
the
'66
statute
that
the
at-large
provision
was
not
new
in
'71.
appellees
contend
that
the
attorney
general
also
should
have
known
from
the
face
of
the
1966
statute
that
the
at-large
provision
was
first
enacted
in
that
year
and,
thus,
was
a
change
requiring
preclearance.
but,
the
attorney
general
did
not
know
from
the
1966
statute
that
its
provision
for
at-large
elections
was
not
a
mere
codification
of
prior
law
as
was
the
identical
1971
provision
and,
in
any
event,
what
the
attorney
general
perhaps
should
have
known
or
should
have
inquired
into
is
irrelevant.
the
right
guaranteed
minority
voters
under
section
5
is
actual
scrutiny
of
voting
changes
before
they
are
put
into
effect.
of
course,
if
the
attorney
general,
in
fact,
had
considered
a
particular
change,
regardless
of
whether
he
had
been
unambiguously
requested
to
do
so,
section
5
interests
would
have
been
protected,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
the
only
information
the
attorney
general
had
in
1971
were
in
the
difference
between
the
1966
and
the
1971
legislation.
in
order
to
have
evaluated
the
initial
change
from
a
combined
appointed,
elected
council
to
a
council
entirely
elected
at
large,
he
would
have
needed
the
pre-1966
information.
accordingly,
if
the
attorney
general
considered
the
at-large
feature
at
all,
he
did
so
only
in
the
context
of
comparing
an
at-large,
three-member
council
with
an
at-large,
five-member
council.

no.
ms.

yes.
ms.
barbara

it
wasn't
file.
he
requested
a
copy
of
that
act
and
it
was
given
to
him
in
the
context
of
the
'71
submission.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
it
was
the
map
showing
the
three
districts
as
set
up
under
the
'66
legislation
and
the
three
districts
set
up
under
the
'71
legislation.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
as
i
understand
it,
the
attorney
general
does
have
that
computerized
system,
but
he
didn't
have
it
in
1971.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
there
were
files
and
he
could
have
checked,
but
it
is
our
submission
that
the
burden
was
not
on
him
to
do
that
checking,
and
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
submissions,
that
burden
should
not
be
put
on
him.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
in
1982
he
received
requests
for
preclearance
of
more
14,000
changes.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
believe
there
was
a
reference
to
that
in
justice
o'connor's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
port
arthur
case,
but
i
don't
remember
the
exact
figure.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
it
is
our
submission
that
because
the
change
to
at-large
elections
itself
has
never
been
subjected
to
scrutiny
under
section
5,
the
attorney
general's
objection
should
be
in
force.
