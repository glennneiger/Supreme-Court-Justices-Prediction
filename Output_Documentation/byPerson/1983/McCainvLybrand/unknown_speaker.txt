unknown
speaker
mr.
mcdonald,
what
was
the
nature
of
the
1966
change
that
you
are
describing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcdonald,
what
if
the
strictly
factual
question
of
did
the
attorney
general,
in
fact,
evaluate
the
1966
change
was
to
be
answered
the
way
you
said
it
should,
no,
he
did
not.
but,
nonetheless,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
it
had
been
totally,
adequately
called
to
his
attention,
all
of
the
significant
data
were
before
him
at
the
time
he
was
looking
at
the
1971
change.
do
you
think
the
simple
fact
that
he
did
not
actually
get
into
the
1966
change
was
prevented
from
becoming
cleared
as
a
result
of
the
'71
submission?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
the
1971
change,
just
as
you
said,
and
i
don't
doubt
it
is,
but
it
makes
some
reference
to
what
happened
in
1966.
when
the
attorney
general
see
that,
he
says,
now,
wait
a
minute,
it
looks
to
me
like
something
has
happened
in
1966
that
didn't...
hasn't
been
called
to
our
attention.
submit
to
me
as
a
supplement
to
your
1971
request
for
clearance
all
the
data
that
i
will
need
on
the
'66
change.
unknown
speaker
but,
supposing
that
had
happened.
unknown
speaker
it
was
also
concluded
as
a
matter
of
fact,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
if
we
agree
with
your
presentation
and
conclude
that
edgefield
county
never
had
the
preclearance
for
the
'66
election
by
virtue
of
the
action
in
1971,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
second
question--
unknown
speaker
--raised
on
the
'76
election?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
is
it
agreed
that
the
1966
act
was
filed
with
the
attorney
general
while
he
was
considering
the
act
of
1971?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
received
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
maps
were
made
available
to
the
attorney
general
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this?
does
the
ag's
office...
do
you...
well,
you
are
not
in
the
attorney
general's
office.
does
the
attorney
general
have
computer
information
stored
that
shows
the
requests
that
have
been
made
and
shows
obviously
requests
that
have
not
been
made?
unknown
speaker
no
files
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
check
to
see
whether
requests
had
ever
been
made?
unknown
speaker
how
many
submissions
are
made
in
a
year
now?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
work
out
per
working
day?
have
you
done
that?
we
can
figure
it
later.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
reason
why
the
'66
one
wasn't
submitted?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question?
the
1966
act,
do
you
agree
that
that
was
a
voting
change?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
change?
unknown
speaker
and,
is
it
your
position
that
that
was
implicitly
cleared
in
'71
or
it
became
unnecessary
to
clear
it
when
you
had
a
different
scheme
in
'71?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
do
not
contend
that
the
action
in
1971,
in
effect,
cleared
the
'66
change?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
position
is
that
you...
that
clearance
in
'71
cleared
the
entire
statute
regardless
of
how
many
changes
it
made?
unknown
speaker
and,
regardless
of
how
many
features
of
the
statute
were
previous
changes
that
had
never
been
precleared.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
really
comes
down
to
a
question
of
who
had
the
duty
to
find
out
how
many
changes
there
were.
your
submission
is
that
the
attorney
general
should
have
found
out
how
many
changes
there
were
to
satisfy
himself
and
his
argument
is
you
should
have
told
him
what
the
changes
were?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
whole
fight.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
one
other
question?
i
take
it
your
submission
would
be
precisely
the
same
even
if
the
1966
act
had
not
been
given
to
the
attorney
general?
unknown
speaker
was
the
'66
law
ever
presented
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance
up
until
this
moment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
south
carolina
has
been
relieved
of
its
duty?
its
duty
was
to
present
it
for
preclearance.
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
been
excused
of
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
said
you
had
never
submitted
it.
you
just
said
you
had
submitted
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
not
the
'66
one.
unknown
speaker
be
careful
when
you
say
you
are
not
including
'66.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
then,
ms.
henderson,
that
the
attorney
general
took
a
different
position
in
'71
than
he
did
in
1980.
unknown
speaker
ms.
henderson,
under...
i
would
think
it
is
under
your
submission
that
if
a
locality,
city
or
county
or
state
passes
a
new
ordinance
or
a
new
law
and
you
just
put
it
in
the
mail
to
the
attorney
general
and
say,
please
clear
this,
that
that
clears
every
possible
change
that
might
be
involved.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
would
you
say
then
that
just
mailing
the
ordinance
or
the
act
in
1971
would
be
enough?
unknown
speaker
you
just
mail
it.
i
think
that
is
your
position,
that
you
just
mail
the
ordinance
and
you
don't
tell
them
what
change,
it
is
up
to
him
to
go
and
look
up
all
the
changes
there
are.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
were
you
supposed
to
do
in
1971?
unknown
speaker
submit
the
act
or
the
ordinance.
what
was
it?
was
it
an
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
it
was
an
act.
what
else
were
you
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
did
say
something
when
you
sent
it
in,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
and,
you
didn't
say
what
a
change
was
or--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
probably
what
led
the
attorney
general
to
write
and
ask
for
the
'66
act,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
attorney
general
sent
back
and
said...
wants
the
'66
act
and
then
he
decided
that
the
change
between...
that
the
'71
act
effected
as
compared
to
the
'66
was
all
right.
he
precleared
that.
unknown
speaker
but,
your
assumption
also
is
that
he
also
cleared
the
'66
act
as
compared
with
the
change...
the
change
that
was
effected
by
the
'66
act.
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
ever
ask
him
to
preclear
the
'66
act?
you
never
asked
him
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
he
preclear
it
if
you
didn't
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
a
minute
ago
said
it
had
been
precleared.
you
now
say
it
is
moot.
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position
that
the
'66
act
is
precleared
or
it
was
mooted
out
by
the
'71
act.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
don't
maintain
it
was
precleared?
unknown
speaker
have
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
1966
act
been
retained
or
were
retained
in
the
1971
act,
any
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
what
were
they?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and,
the
number
of
districts
was
increased
from
three
to
five.
unknown
speaker
and
all
five
districts
were
changed
and
maps
were
submitted
that
showed
the
districts
that
pre-existed
'71?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
the
1971
act,
with
those
changes,
has
just
completely
supplanted
the
1966
act?
unknown
speaker
and,
the
basic
criticism
of
the
present
statute
is...
well,
both
of
the
statutes,
i
suppose,
was
in
theory
the
elections
were
at-large.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
law
in
existence
prior
to
'66?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
date
of
the
act
that
governed
that?
unknown
speaker
the
attorney
general
never
asked
for
that,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
didn't
know...
had
no
idea
what
the
change
of
the
'66
act
effected?
unknown
speaker
he
never
asked
you
for
anything
before
then.
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
have
to
compare
it
to
the
'66
act
with
anything.
all
he
had
to
compare
was
the
'71
act
with
the
'66
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
quite
correct,
is
it?
he
could
stop
at
the
'66
act
if
he
believed,
even
erroneously,
that
the
'66
act
made
no
change
in
prior
law.
if
he
was
under
the
impression
that
there
had
been
at-large
voting
since
before
1964,
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
have
precleared
the
'66
act
because
it
would
not
have
effected
a
change.
unknown
speaker
the
amendment
have
a
minor
change.
unknown
speaker
but,
if
he
didn't
look
at.
say
he
just
was
so
busy
with
all
these
thousands
of
submission
that
he
didn't
realize
that
there
was
a
blatantly
discriminatory
change
the
year
before,
you
would
be
in
the
clear.
i
mean,
he
has
to
be
alert
under
your
theory
and
look
at
what
happened
in
the
time
period
preceding
the
immediately
preceding
act.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but,
if
fails
to
do
it,
if
he
is
not
alert--
unknown
speaker
--then
you
win.
unknown
speaker
a
fortiori
you
wouldn't
win
back
in
'71.
i
mean,
at
that
time,
there
wasn't
any
rule
about
submitting.
unknown
speaker
you
do
answer
justice
stevens,
back
in
1971
he
was
obligated
to
look
back.
unknown
speaker
yes.
he
was
obligated
to
look
back
if
he
ever
wanted
to
raise
a
question
about
any
uncleared
item.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
required
for
the
voters
to
prevail
under
any
of
those
alternative
theories?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
can't
show
that,
then
there
would
be
no
relief
under
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
