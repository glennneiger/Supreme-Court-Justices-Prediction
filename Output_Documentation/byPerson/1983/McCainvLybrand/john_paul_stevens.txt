but,
under
your
view,
a
jurisdiction
could
pass
a
new
law
with
a
dramatic
change
in
it
and
not
submit
it
and
the
next
year
pass
a
carbon
copy
of
the
new
law
and
say
here
is
what
the
old
one
was
and
he
would
be
presumed
to
have
precleared
the
change
he
didn't
know
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
presents
a
question
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
has
been
amended
several
times
since
then.
edgefield
county,
south
carolina
is
a
jurisdiction
that's
subject
to
the
provisions
of
that
statute
and
the
statute
requires
that
such
a
jurisdiction
when
it
makes
a
change
in
election
practices
must
submit
the
change
either
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
to
a
three-judge
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
approval
before
the
change
may
become
effective.
most
frequently
covered
jurisdictions
will
follow
the
procedure
of
submission
to
the
attorney
general.
in
1966,
south
carolina
adopted
a
statute
that
changed
the
practices
in
edgefield
county,
but
neither
the
state
nor
the
county
submitted
the
change
for
approval.
in
1971
however,
another
statute
was
adopted
and
that
statute
was
submitted
and
ultimately
was
approved
by
the
attorney
general.
and
in
connection
with
the
approval,
the
--
the
earlier
1966
statute
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
question
that
arises
is
whether
the
1971
approval
embodied
approval
of
the
earlier
statute.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
south
carolina
held
that
it
was
implicitly
approved.
we
reverse
that
holding
today
because
the
submission
to
the
attorney
general
in
1971
did
not
call
his
attention
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
1966
and
the
1966
changed
itself
was
never
submitted
for
approval,
so
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
south
carolina.
the
opinion
--
i
should
say
justice
blackmun,
justice
powell
and
justice
rehnquist
have
concurred
in
the
judgment
but
not
joined
in
the
opinion
which
is
otherwise
unanimous.
