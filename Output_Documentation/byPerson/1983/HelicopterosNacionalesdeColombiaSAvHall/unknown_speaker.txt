unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
why
were
bell
helicopter
company
and
williams-sedco-horn
granted
instructed
verdicts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
was
the
underlying
cause
of
action
based
on
pilot
error?
unknown
speaker
was
the
pilot
of
the
helicopter
involved
trained
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
was
the
helicopter
itself
purchased
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
regard
both
of
those
as
contacts
with
texas
on
the
part
of
your
client?
unknown
speaker
unless
we
regard
the
training
in
texas
and
the
purchase
of
the
helicopter
there
as
bearing
on
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
i
suppose
if
the
facts
were
exactly
the
way
they
were
except
that
the
accident
had
taken
place
while
they
were
flying
over
texas
there
would
be
no
question
they
had
jurisdiction
to
sue
helicol
for
that
particular
accident.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
difference
if
there
were
an
adequate
showing
that
the
training
itself
caused
the
accident?
i
mean,
if
he
was
poorly
trained
and
that
was
proved.
unknown
speaker
would
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
was
trained
if
he
turns
to
the
left
he
should
boot
it
to
the
right,
and
that
is
what
wrecked
the
plane
and
everybody
in
the
world
agrees
that
that
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
and
he
was
taught
that
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
in
peru
could
bell
helicopter
and
williams-sedco-horn
have
been
sued
in
peru--
unknown
speaker
--it
had
jurisdiction
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
contract
provision
that
provides
for
jurisdiction
of
disputes
in
peru?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
contract
provision
means
what
it
says
and
if
you
were
to
rely
on
it
i
suppose
the
contract
was
entered
into
in
a
sense
in
texas
and
that
might
give
texas
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
like
to
forget
all
about
the
contract
provision
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
argument
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
a
purchaser
or
a
buyer
of
goods
in
the
forum
state
would
be
sufficient
simply
because
of
the
quantity
purchased,
let's
say,
or
the
frequency
of
that
occasion
to
provide
general
jurisdiction
over
that
buyer?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
that
that
distinction
alters
the
relationship
of
texas
with
the
buyer
though.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
is
to
determine
the
extent
of
contacts
with
the
state
of
texas
in
this
case
the
forum
state
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
what
interest
the
state
of
texas
would
have
and
the
degree
to
which
texas,
for
instance,
might
want
to
consider
the
interests
of
the
buyer
i
would
think
it
would
not
make
such
difference
why
the
buyer
planned
to
buy
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
helicol
was
doing
business
and
it
qualified
to
do
business
in
texas,
the
kind
of
business
it
does.
it
furnishes
helicopter
transportation
i
guess,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
was
qualified
to
do
business
in
texas
on
that
basis
but
suppose
that
it
was
also
in
business
in
peru
and
on
the
side
it
was
in
the
real
estate
business
and
it
borrowed
some
money
to
buy
some
real
estate
and
did
not
pay
the
note.
could
it
be
sued
in
texas
on
that
note?
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
have
arisen
out
of
any
of
the
business
they
did
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
it
was,
but
not
a
real
estate...
the
only
business
it
ever
did
in
texas
was
the
transportation
business.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
is
general
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
presence.
it
is
present.
unknown
speaker
but
just
a
purchaser
of
a
helicopter
who
does
business
in
peru...
he
buys
a
helicopter
in
texas.
he
does
helicopter
business
in
peru.
he
could
not
be
sued
on
the
note
that
he
signed
to
buy
some
real
estate
in
peru.
unknown
speaker
which
you
say
is
like
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pletcher,
were
any
of
the
plaintiffs
domiciled
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
even
though
one
of
their
domiciliaries
had
been
killed
as
a
result
of
the
claimed
negligence?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
volkswagen
the
plaintiff
was
clearly
resident
of
oklahoma,
but
that
was
really
all
that
was
going--
unknown
speaker
--well,
your
position
i
take
it
is
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
a
cause
of
action
that
is
being
pressed
against
the
helicopter
company
as
long
as
it
has
these
minimum
contacts
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that...
suppose
some
united
states
company
sold
the
helicopter
company
some
gasoline
to
be
delivered
in
peru
and
the
helicopter
company
did
not
pay
its
bills.
could
it
be
sued
in
texas
on
that
bill
just
because
it
has
these
minimum
contacts?
i
would
think
you
would
say
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
united
states
company
selling
the
gasoline
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
texas.
unknown
speaker
it
shipped
the...
it
is
from
california.
it
ships
it
out
of
california,
but
it
sues
in
texas
just
because
that
is
where
it
wants
to
sue.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
focal
point
is
whether
they
can
sue
any
place
else?
unknown
speaker
except
peru.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pletcher,
you
said
that
there
is
no
issue
here
of
minimum
contacts
that
they
conceded?
unknown
speaker
would
you
summarize
them,
mr
pletcher?
unknown
speaker
including
the
pilot
of
this
plane?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pletcher,
is
that
negotiation
of
the
contract
which
was
the
source
of
the
business
they
did
in
peru
really
any
different
from
the
purchase
of
the
helicopters
themselves?
they
got
the
raw
material
and
the
contractual
rights
and
all
with
which
to
carry
on
their
business
in
peru.
they
got
those
in
texas.
but
aren't
those
all
just
a
more
dramatic
example
of
the
case
that
your
opponent
says
is
controlling
here,
the
case
that
holds
the
purchases
are
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
that
case
i
guess
is
the
bottom
line
of
my
question?
unknown
speaker
overrule
the
rosenberg
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
think
you
had
enough
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
case
except
the
purchase
of
the
helicopters?
unknown
speaker
my
problem
is
you
have
got
purchases
plus
training
plus
the
negotiation
of
the
contract
that
enable
you
to
do
business.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
any
one
of
those
is
different
from
the
other
two
analytically.
that
is
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
do
you
put
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
they
purchased
80
percent
of
their
flying
equipment
in
houston?
unknown
speaker
how
many
planes
was
that?
unknown
speaker
you
said
80
percent
you
think
it
is
a
number
don't
you?
why
didn't
you
say
five
instead
of
80
percent?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
opponent
concedes
that...
i
should
have
asked
him.
maybe
i
still
will...
concedes
that
if
they
had
not
paid
for
the
helicopters
they
could
be
sued
in
texas
for
the
purchase
price?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
think
he
should
concede
your
case.
unknown
speaker
based
on
minimum
contacts.
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
a
prevailing
law
that
if
you
purchased
goods
in
a
state
if
that
is
the
only
thing
you
do
in
a
state
purchasing
from
abroad
you
can
be
sued
in
that
state
for
the
purchase
price.
is
that
a
general
rule
you
think?
unknown
speaker
the
cases
are
split.
unknown
speaker
a
fortiori
there
would
be
a
big
split
on
this
one?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some
cases
that
support
you?
unknown
speaker
is
perkins
relied
on
below?
unknown
speaker
so
you...
just
any
cause
of
action
that
might
exist
against
the
helicopter
company
could
be
brought
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
resident
of
ohio
buys
some
stock
in
the
helicopter
company
and
the
company
is
not
doing
very
well
and
they
think
the
directors
are
guilty
of
fraud
or
something
so
they
want
to
bring
a
derivative
suit.
can
they
bring
a
derivative
suit
or
can
they
sue
the
directors
of
the
helicopter
company
in
texas,
sue
the
helicopter
company
itself?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
these
very
facts
of
yours
you
think
that
suit
would
lie?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
i
take
it
the
pilot
was
not
a
defendant.
unknown
speaker
the
pilot
was
not
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
his
estate
was
not
named?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
if
there
were
kind
of
a
world-wide
due
process
clause
administered
perhaps
by
the
world
court
of
the
hague
and
that
court
had
decided
a
world
international
shoe
case
talking
about
minimum
contacts
for
a
country
certainly
somewhere
in
the
united
states
should
qualify
as
minimum
contacts
to
adjudicate
this
dispute
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
did
not
arise
but
all
the
plaintiffs
reside
in
the
united
states.
certainly
the
defendant
had
some
contacts
with
the
united
states.
i
grant
you
so
far
as
texas
when
you
try
to
pick
one
out
of
several
of
the
united
states
no
one
of
them
seems
very
strong,
but
i
have
a
rather
strong
conviction
that
somewhere
in
the
united
states
there
ought
to
be
jurisdiction
to
try
this.
unknown
speaker
one
does
not
decide
on
those
feelings.
i
realize
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
whalen,
let
me
ask
the
question
i
think
you
have
not
answered.
supposing
the
suit
was
not
arising
out
of
an
airplane
action
in
peru
but
rather
supposing
your
client
had
not
paid
for
the
helicopters
and
the
manufacturer
wanted
to
sue
them.
could
they
sue
your
client
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
cause
of
action
arose
out
of
the
activity
in
texas
which
would
be
unlike
this?
unknown
speaker
let
me
change
it.
say
they
did
not
pay
for
the
training
school
for
their
pilots.
they
bought
the
helicopters
and
they
had
them
trained
in
texas
and
then
they
did
not
pay
for
the
instruction
on
how
to
fly
the
helicopters.
i
suppose
that
is
pretty
close
to
the
same.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
arose
out
of
a
commercial
relationship
in
my
hypothetical
which
is
an
unsatisfied
debt
and
so
forth.
well,
anyway
i
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
anyway
that
is
a
different
case.
