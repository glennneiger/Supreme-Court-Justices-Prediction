mr.
george
e.
pletcher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
clients
it
is
true
were
not
residents
of
the
state
of
texas.
their
relationship
with
the
state
of
texas
was
purely
with
williams-sedco-horn
which
was
domiciled
in
the
state
of
texas
in
houston.
these
four
men
were
employed
in
texas
by
williams-sedco-horn
to
work
over
in
peru.
my
clients
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
helicol
contacts
with
the
state
of
texas.
they
came
into
the
state
of
texas
based
upon
the
record
in
this
case,
and
the
discovery
was
limited
to
that
area
of
time
from
1970
when
the
helicopter
which
crashed
in
peru
was
purchased
in
texas
up
until
the
time
of
the
special
appearance
motion
being
heard.
helicol
came
into
the
state
of
texas
for
far
greater
reasons
than
simply
to
buy
some
helicopters
and
some
helicopter
parts.
in
addition
to
purchasing
the
helicopter
which
crashed
this
company
purchased
approximately
80
percent
of
its
fleet,
and
it
purchased
virtually
all
of
the
parts
that
were
necessary
to
keep
that
fleet
going.
they
also
had
pilots
who
were
trained
in
the
state
of
texas,
and
they
also
had
their
maintenance
personnel
who
were
trained
in
texas.
they
did
not
stay
in
colombia
and
order
helicopters
and
parts
from
the
state
of
texas
and
then
wait
for
them
to
be
delivered.
they
sent
their
people
to
texas
and
they
sent
their
people
from
the
head
man
in
that
company,
mr.
restrepo,
the
executive
vice
president,
the
head
of
the
maintenance
department
of
that
company
as
well
as
their
pilots
and
their
maintenance
personnel.
the
records
in
this
case
will
indicate
that
there
were
some
33
different
business
trips
taken
to
the
state
of
texas
by
various
officials
and
employees
of
this
company.
now
when
this
incident
occurred
in
peru
the
plaintiffs
were
immediately
faced
with
one
fundamental
problem
and
that
was
where
could
their
rights
be
determined.
knowing
that
this
court
has
for
the
last
38
years
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
the
standard
of
minimum
contacts
established
in
international
shoe,
the
cornerstone
of
a
jurisdiction
in
personam
case
must
be
that
there
be
certain
minimum
contacts.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
no,
your
honor,
not
one
of
them,
none
of
the
decedents
nor
any
of
their
families.
the
families
were
from
illinois,
two
families
from
oklahoma
and
one
family
from
arizona.
helicol
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
illinois.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
arizona
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
of
oklahoma
except
for
one
brief
overnight
stay
there
on
the
way
to
texas
to
discuss
the
contract
which
has
already
been
mentioned
in
the
opening
argument
by
my
adversary.
the
states
of
whom
my
people
were
resident
could
not
hear
their
case
because
under
this
court's
ruling
of
no
contacts,
no
jurisdiction
then
those
three
states
could
not
possibly
have
passed
upon
my
clients'
rights.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
have
repeatedly
reaffirmed,
your
honor,
that
unless
there
be
minimum
contacts
then
nothing
else
matters,
that
it
simply--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes,
sir,
that
is
all
there
was
in
volkswagen.
but
without
those
minimum
contacts
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
there
can
be
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
no,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
having
once
established
minimum
contacts
which
has
been
done,
and
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
there
is
at
least
minimum
contacts
in
this
case,
that
then
the
focus
of
attention
shifts
from
merely
what
did
the
defendant
do
in
the
forum
state
to
examining
the
case
from
its
four
corners
and
particularly
in
this
court's
opinion
written
by
your
honor
in
the
volkswagen
case
and
that
is
where
else
can
the
plaintiffs
go
to
have
their
cause
of
action
heard.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
the
single
act
contact
cases
that
are
in
both
federal
and
state
courts
in
quite
a
state
of
disarray.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
am
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
court's--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
then
that
jurisdiction
would
be
permitted,
and
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
permitted--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--well,
if
they
could
sue
any
place
else,
that
is,
the
situation
in
my
case
here
is
that
there
is
no
place
else
in
the
united
states--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--except
peru
or
colombia.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
conceded
except
insofar
as
the
quality
and
the
quantity
and
the
importance
of
those
contacts,
but
that
the
contacts
exist
i
think
is--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes,
sir.
there
was
in
addition
to
those
that
i
have
already
mentioned,
justice
prennan,
there
was
the
purchase
of
the
helicopters.
there
was
the
repeated
purchases
to
the
tune
of
about
$50,000
per
month
of
parts.
there
was
the
training
of
the
pilots.
there
was
the
training
of
the
maintenance
personnel--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes,
sir.
there
was
the
plant
familiarization.
the
record
will
indicate
and
my
adversary
points
out
in
a
reply
brief
that
although
it
never
came
to
fruition
helicol
was
trying
to
get
to
become
a
designated
repair
facility
for
bell
helicopter
over
in
colombia.
they
had
on
three
occasions
their
head
man
and
their
maintenance
department
come
to
fort
worth
three
different
years
for
plant
familiarization.
in
addition
to
that
if
it
please
the
court
the
general
manager
of
this
colombian
corporation
came
to
houston,
texas.
he
came
there
to
discuss
and
negotiate
the
very
contract
that
counsel
spoke
of.
now
it
is
true.
we
have
never
claimed
that
that
contract
was
executed
in
texas
because
it
was
not.
it
was
executed
in
peru
because
it
had
to
be
executed
in
peru.
but
it
was
negotiated
right
in
houston,
texas.
williams-sedco-horn
was
a
group
of
three
companies
that
was
formed
purely
and
simply
to
do
this
work
over
in
peru.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
well,
your
honor--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--am
i
asking
you
to--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--no,
sir.
i
am
not
asking
you
to
overrule
that
case
at
all.
what
i
am
suggesting
though
is
that
that
case
since
it
was
decided
23
year
before
the
minimum
contact
standard
was
ever
established
and
dealt
purely
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
purchases
alone
equated
with
corporate
presence
which
was
the
fiction
which
was
then
being
used
and
which
was
later
abandoned
by
this
court.
that
is
no
longer
controlling
in
a
case
involving
commercial
contacts
which
is
now
the
minimum
contact
standard.
i
do
not
think
that
the
rosenberg
decision
needs
to
be
overruled.
i
just
think
that
it
is--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--i
certainly
would
not
have
enough
in
the
case
if
counsel
persuades
this
court
to
ignore
purchases
as
he
requests.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
yes.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
well,
they
are
different
only
to
the
extent
that
one
is
frank
purchase
of
goods
and
the
other
is
a
negotiation
of
a
contract
to
perform
services.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
believe
they
bought
five
helicopters
in
fort
worth.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
well,
because
the
percentage
was
the
word
that
was
given
by
helicol.
that
is
where
we
got
our
information
about
what
percentage
of
their
fleet
was
purchased
in
texas.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
do
not
know
if
he
would
concede
it,
but
he
should
concede
it,
your
honor.
are
you
talking
about
if
bell--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--bell
certainly
would
be
entitled
to
sue
for
the
failure
of
helicol
to
pay
for
their
helicopters.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
yes,
sir,
based
on
minimum
contacts
and
arising
out
of
the
transaction.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
no,
sir.
i
think
that--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes.
i
think
that
is
where
the
division
of
authority
is.
i
think
that
is
where
that
disarray
is
that--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
well,
your
honor,
i
have
basically
the
perkins
case.
the
perkins
case
is
not
unlike
this
case
except
in
one
way
and
that
is
that
there
the
philippine
company
president
because
the
japanese
had
taken
over
the
philippine
islands
flew
back
to
his
home
state
of
ohio
and
was
actually
physically
present
there.
but
the
basic
factual
situation
in
that
case
is
the
same
as
it
is
here.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
oh,
yes,
sir.
because
there
in
the
perkins
case
a
nonresident
plaintiff
sued
a
nonresident
defendant
on
a
cause
of
action
which
was
entirely
unrelated
to
contacts
within
the
state,
and
there
this
court
held
that
ohio
did
not
have
to
open
its
courts
but
it
was
not
constitutionally
prohibited
from
doing
so.
that
is
basically
our
argument
and
has
been
from
the
outset
in
this
case
is
that
the
contacts
with
this
nonresident
defendant
were
so
pervasive
and
over
such
a
long
period
of
time
and
of
such
substance
that
it
is
then
what
we
ask
the
court
to
do
and
what
this
court
has
said
is
a
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
other
factors
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable
and
fair
to
ask
a
nonresident
defendant
to
appear
in
the
forum
state
to
defend
a
cause
of
action.
it
is
our
belief
and
we
urge
upon
this
court
that
once
you
look
at
this
case
on
those
other
relevant
matters
they
all
come
down
favoring
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
only
if
it
is
fair
and
reasonable
to
do
so,
your
honor.
that
is
the
second
protection
that
a
nonresident--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--yes,
sir.
i
believe
they
could
if
it
is
shown
that
the
helicopter
company
is
doing
business
on
a
consistent
basis
in
texas.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
general
presence
in
the
state
of
texas
under
those
circumstances.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
it
is
fair
and
reasonable
to
expect
them
to
come
in
and
defend
that
case.
but,
your
honor,
the
fairness
doctrine
which
is
the
second
peg
of
the
minimum
contacts
standard
set
forth
in
international
shoe
protects
defendants
against
those
kind
of
cases
that
in
a
given
case
may
render
it
unfair
and
unjust
and
not
in
keeping
with
the
traditional
notions
of
fair
play.
there
is
another
matter
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
particularly
with
reference
to
a
question
by
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
in
the
country
of
peru
the
plaintiffs
could
have
sued
bell
helicopter
company.
your
honor,
from
this
record
i
think
that
it
is
not
possible
even
if
we
assume
that
the
country
of
peru
has
the
same
jurisdictional
standards
that
we
have
in
this
court.
i
think
that
there
is
absolutely
no
showing
that
bell
helicopter
had
any
contacts
with
the
country
of
peru
topside
or
bottom.
that
is
one
of
our
problems
and
was
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
in
colombia
the
record
would
reflect
bell
helicopter
has
a
representative
but
williams-sedco-horn
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
country.
the
only
place
in
the
united
states
that
my
clients
could
have
their
rights
established
was
in
texas,
and
the
only
place
on
earth
that
the
plaintiffs
and
the
three
defendants
could
all
be
joined
together
in
one
cause
of
action
to
efficiently
dispose
of
this
case
was
in
the
state
of
texas.
a
question
was
also
asked
about
why
was
an
instructed
verdict
granted
as
to
williams-sedco-horn
and
bell
helicopter,
and
it
is
true
that
the
plaintiffs,
my
clients,
failed
to
raise
a
fact
issue
as
to
negligence
or
product
defect
as
to
either
of
those
defendants.
it
is
also
true
that
the
helicopter
company's
claim
of
defective
helicopter
was
also
not
such
as
to
raise
a
fact
issue.
a
case
such
as
this
is
almost
a
certainty.
when
a
helicopter
flies
into
a
tree
in
a
fog
and
all
hands
are
killed
either
there
was
pilot
error,
there
was
a
problem
with
the
contractor
pressuring
the
flying
company
to
fly
in
that
weather,
or
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
helicopter.
those
were
all
issues
in
this
case
from
the
outset
by
one
party
against
the
other
parties.
when
this
case
was
finally
tried
and
when
all
of
the
evidence
was
in
those
claims
and
those
cross
claims
were
all
thrown
out
of
court
as
far
as
williams-sedco-horn
and
bell
helicopter
leaving
only
helicol
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
found
as
counsel
has
indicated.
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
the
pilot
was
not.
the
pilot
was
killed
as
well
and
his
estate
was--
mr.
george
e.
pletcher
--no.
only
the
company
was
named
as
a
defendant.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
is
all
the
time
i
need
to
take.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
