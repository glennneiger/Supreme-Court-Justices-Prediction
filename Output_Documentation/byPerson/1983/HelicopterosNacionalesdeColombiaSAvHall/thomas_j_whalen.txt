mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
in
the
cases
we
heard
this
morning
this
case
involves
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
my
client
helicol.
helicol
is
a
foreign
corporation
in
the
true
sense.
it
is
a
company
organized
existing
in
the
country
of
colombia,
and
its
sole
business
is
the
transportation
of
persons
principally
in
south
america.
the
jurisdictional
issue
in
this
case
arises
in
the
context
of
a
wrongful
death
action
which
was
brought
in
the
state
court
of
texas
by
the
family
of
dean
hall
and
several
other
families
who
were
killed
in
an
accident
that
occurred
in
peru.
helicol
had
entered
into
a
contract
with
american
construction
companies
known
as
williams-sedco-horn,
and
this
contract
was
executed
in
peru
and
it
was
designed
to
be
performed
in
peru.
in
the
course
of
this
helicopter
operation
it
was
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
contract
that
williams-sedco-horn
had
with
the
government
of
peru,
and
they
were
building
a
pipeline
from
the
jungles
of
peru
to
the
pacific
ocean.
they
needed
helicol
to
transport
workers
from
construction
sites
to
base
terminals
in
peru.
on
the
course
of
one
of
these
trips
an
accident
occurred
in
which
the
respondents'
decedents
were
killed
along
with
two
other
passengers
who
are
not
involved
in
this
law
suit
or
this
case.
the
case
was
brought
in
the
state
court
of
texas.
the
only
contacts
that
helicol
had
with
the
state
of
texas
was
established
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
on
a
preliminary
motion
on
jurisdiction
was
the
fact
that
helicol
had
a
single
contract
discussion
with
the
personnel
of
williams-sedco-horn
in
houston,
texas,
and
also
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
years
prior
to
that
contract
they
purchased
equipment
from
an
american
manufacturer,
bell
helicopter
company.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
plaintiff
failed
to
establish
any
proof
of
negligence
against
either
of
those
defendants,
and
the
court
dismissed
the
case
against
both
of
those
defendants.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor,
against
my
client.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
he
was.
he
was
one
of
the
pilots
who
went
to
texas
in
the
course
of
the
agreement
between
bell
and
helicol
for
training
in
connection
with
the
equipment.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
the
helicopter
was
purchased
in
texas,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
they
certainly
are
contacts,
but
the
idea
of
purchases
being
a
basis
for
general
jurisdiction,
that
is,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
cause
of
action
did
not
arise
out
of
the
purchase
of
that
helicopter.
even
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
purchase
itself
without
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
verdict
of
the
jury
which
found
that
bell
was
not
at
all
negligent
in
the
manufacture
of
the
helicopter,
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
as
the
jury
found
solely
was
based
upon
the
negligence
of
our
pilot
in
peru.
there
were
no
contacts
of
the
defendant
helicol
in
texas
which
in
any
way
was
connected
or
arose
out
or
created
the
cause
of
action
in
peru.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
no
connection
and
would
also
suggest
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
among
other
things
ruled
that
there
was
no
connection
between
the
cause
of
action
and
the
contacts
in
texas,
and
this
is
the
position
which
i
do
not
believe
my
adversary
contests.
what
we
are
dealing
here
if
your
honor
please
is
not
a
case
of
contacts
in
a
jurisdiction
which
gave
rise
to
a
cause
of
action.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
case
of
what
is
known
as
general
jurisdiction.
is
helicol
there
in
texas?
do
we
have
an
office
which
we
do
not.
do
we
have
employees
located
there
which
we
do
not.
we
have
no
general
contacts
or
base
in
texas
which
under
the
perkins
case
i
believe
would
give
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
against
helicol
with
respect
to
any
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
supreme
court
decided
this
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
there
is
no
question
that
helicol
under
the
ruling
of
this
court,
international
shoe,
would
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
because
the
pilot
error
and
negligence
as
well
as
the
resulting
injury
occurred
in
texas
and
that
there
were
other
minimum
contacts
as
well,
the
contract
discussion,
for
example,
and
perhaps
in
those
cases
in
those
instances
the
purchases
of
equipment
could
be
a
basis
of
additional
minimal
contacts
to
support--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
not.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
it
would
make
no
difference
because
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
peru.
it
would
not
have
arisen
in
texas.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
well,
his--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--well,
if
he
was--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--if
he
was
improperly
taught
by
bell
helicopter
then,
of
course,
bell
helicopter
stands
to
be
liable.
if
he
violated
his
teaching,
what
he
was
taught,
in
texas
in
peru
then
that
negligence
and
the
conduct
or
the
result
of
that
negligence
would
all
have
occurred
in
peru.
there
is
no
connection
i
think
under
your
honor's
example
if
you
please
that
there
is
no
connection
under
your
example
between
the
faulty
training
and
the
accident
in
peru.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
raise
this
question...
we
introduced
our
special
appearance
which
procedurally
is
the
way
in
texas
we
raised
a
jurisdictional
objection.
we
raised
it
approximately
eight
months
after
the
accident
so
if
there
was
a
jurisdictional
problem
then,
of
course,
a
protective
suit
would
be
filed
in
colombia
or
in
peru
in
the
event
jurisdiction
as
we
believe
should
not
be
found
in
texas
on
this
course
of
action.
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
we
had
to
continue
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
and
we
appealed
solely
on
the
jurisdictional
issue.
the
case
went
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
where
it
reversed
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
that
the
court
had
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
helicol.
the
other
side
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
initially
affirmed
the
decision
of
its
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
but
my
adversary
then
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
reversed.
it
is
our
position
that
the
contacts
or
the
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
solely
general
jurisdiction
that
the
contacts
that
helicol
had
in
texas
were
insufficient
to
form
a
basis
for
general
jurisdiction.
as
the
united
states
government--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
would
interpret
that
provision
as
determining
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
that
contract
which
in
that
case
would
be
williams-sedco-horn
and
helicol.
i
do
not
rely
on
that
decision
but
it
does
indicate
the
intention
of
the
parties
particularly
helicol
to
remove
any
basis
for
jurisdiction
by
any
united
states
court.
their
operation--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
contract
was
not
entered
into
in
texas.
there
were
contract
discussions
and
the
cause
of
action,
the
negligence
cause
of
action,
to
the
respondents
who
are
before
the
court
did
not
arise
out
of
that
contract.
it
arose
simply
out
of
the
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
pilot
of
helicol.
so
again
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
that
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
arose
out
of
that
contract.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor,
for
the
purposes
of
the
jurisdiction
of
these
plaintiffs
against
this
defendant
on
the
plaintiffs'
cause
of
action.
if
the
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
is
to
be
upheld
that
the
purchases
of
$4
million
worth
of
equipment
from
an
american
vendor
which
is
the
principle
contact
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
relied
on
for
general
jurisdiction
then
it
would
appear
that
any
time
a
foreign
company
purchased
american
products
from
an
american
vendor
no
matter
what
its
extent
that
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
which
is
unrelated
to
those
purchases
that
foreign
purchaser
could
be
dragged
into
american
litigation
and
all
the
expenses
involved
in
it
solely
because
of
the
purchase
of
american
products.
as
the
united
states
government
in
this
case
succinctly
but
pointedly
established
this
would
as
a
policy
matter
be
against
the
export
policy
of
the
united
states.
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
certain
policy
matters
have
entered
into
the
decisions
as
to
whether
there
should
be
or
should
not
be
jurisdiction.
one
of
the
policy
matters
in
some
of
the
cases
has
been
the
residence
of
the
plaintiff.
i
should
point
out
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
respondents
were
residents
of
texas.
so
we
have
in
this
case
plaintiffs
who
are
nonresidents
of
texas
suing
a
company
which
is
not
based
in
texas
on
a
cause
of
action
which
occurred
in
peru,
and
as
the
supreme
court
and
the
respondents
acknowledge
there
is
no
connection
between
the
contacts
of
helicol
in
texas
and
the
ultimate
cause
of
action
which
was
brought
against
helicol
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
international
shoe
through
volkswagen
have
emphasized
that
there
must
be
a
relationship
between
the
parties,
the
litigation
and
the
forum
if
jurisdiction
is
to
be
established
over
a
nonresident
who
is
not
based
in
the
forum
state.
in
this
case
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
helicol
in
no
way
was
based
in
texas,
and
lacking
that
finding
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
acknowledged
there
can
be
no
basis
for
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
helicol
on
an
unrelated
cause
of
action.
i
think
this
court
respectfully
is
bound
by
the
findings
of
the
supreme
court
and
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
that
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
did
not
arise
out
of
the
contacts
of
helicol
in
texas.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
business
of
the
company
was
the
buying
and
selling
of
helicopter
equipment
and
that
the
company
went
into
texas
to
buy
equipment
for
the
purpose
of
reselling
it
then
in
that
case
i
would
suggest
that
that
company
by
buying
that
equipment
would
be
doing
some
business
under
those
circumstances.
but
whereas
helicol
was
buying
capital
goods
for
the
use
of
its
business
in
south
america
its
business
is
not
buying
and
selling
equipment.
its
business
is
transporting
people
in
south
america.
so
the
purchase
of
capital
goods
i
suggest
to
the
court
cannot
be
the
basis
for
a
finding
of
doing
business,
and
i
believe
that
this
was
the
gist
of
justice
brandeis'
decision
in
the
rosenberg
case
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
he
points
out
that
purchases
are
not
doing
business.
that
was
a
case
arising
in
new
york.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
but
the
cause
of
action,
your
honor,
was
based
upon
that
purchase,
and
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
a
contact
on
which
jurisdiction
would
be
based
against
helicol,
that
is,
if
helicol
failed
to
pay
for
its
equipment
and
bell
wanted
to
sue
helicol
for
its
failure
then
i
believe
that
helicol
plus
other
contacts...
those
purchases
plus
other
contacts
would
form
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
because
the
cause
of
action
arose
out
of
those
contacts.
i
hope
i
have
answered
your
question,
your
honor.
i
am
not
certain
i
have.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
on
your
facts,
your
honor,
yes
it
could
because
i
think
the
first
point
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
thought
you
said
that
helicol
was
authorized
to
do
business
in
texas--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--i
would
interpret--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--i
think
if
it
consents
if
it
files
with
the
state
and
says
i
want
to
do
business
in
this
state
i
in
effect
consent
to
the
general
jurisdiction
and
i
recognize
that
the
case
that
the
amicus
brief,
not
the
united
states,
the
other
brief,
has
contested
this
point,
but
my
view
is
that
if
a
company
files
with
a
state
asking
for
authority
to
do
business
i
believe
under
one
of
the
older
supreme
court
decisions
that
he
has
consented
to
jurisdiction,
and
i
would
consider
that
a
consent
to
be
sued
on
any
cause
of
action.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
that
is
right.
he
could
not,
your
honor,
under
no
circumstances.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
yes,
your
honor.
my
adversary
in
this
case
apparently
is
prepared
to
have
the
case
decided
on
the
perkins
case.
he
says
that
this
case
is
identical
to
the
perkins
case.
the
facts
in
the
perkins
case
are
that
it
was
a
company
that
was
principally
doing
business
in
the
philippines
and
because
of
the
war
in
effect
had
to
leave
the
philippines
and
set
up
operations
in
ohio.
the
president
was
there.
they
actually
operated
business,
all
kinds
of
business,
from
ohio.
they
had
employees,
payroll,
bank
account,
offices,
employees
located
there.
they
had
set
up
shop,
and
the
position
i
think
of
this
court
in
the
perkins
case
was
as
a
commentator
says
it
is
never
a
violation
of
due
process
for
a
defendant
to
be
sued
in
his
own
backyard.
in
that
case
the
defendant
had
in
effect
set
up
an
office.
he
was
equivalent
to
a
domiciliary
and
under
those
circumstances
a
defendant
should
be
subject
to
suit
on
any
cause
of
action,
and
that
is
essentially
what
this
court
held
in
that
case.
perkins
came
after
international
shoe
and
perkins
was
in
a
sense
signaled
by
international
shoe
because
the
language
in
international
shoe
suggested
that
there
would
be
circumstances
in
which
the
contacts
were
so
great
they
were
substantial,
continuous,
systematic
doing
business
that
the
cause
of
action
would
not
necessarily
have
to
arise
out
of
those
facts
in
order
as
a
matter
of
due
process
jurisdiction
could
be
had.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
this
court
in
international
shoe
cited
the
rosenberg
case,
cited
it
indicating
that
it
still
had
strength
even
after
international
shoe.
i
would
point
out
in
rosenberg
and
to
this
extent
rosenberg
may
very
well
have
been
changed
to
some
extent
by
international
shoe.
in
that
case
the
cause
of
action
arose
out
of
the
conduct
in
new
york
although
it
is
not
clear
from
the
facts
as
to
whether
it
arose
out
of
the
purchases.
notwithstanding
the
fact
in
rosenberg
that
the
cause
of
action
arose
out
of
conduct
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
purchases...
the
purchase
of
a
significant
amount
of
capital
as
well
as
inventory
is
not
sufficient
to
form
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
that
defendant.
i
think
my
adversary's
position
in
this
case
is
simply
that
he
represents
united
states
citizens
and
that
his
court,
the
texas
court,
should
provide
a
forum
somewhere
in
this
country--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--no,
your
honor.
there
are
no
minimum
contacts
as
i
understand
the
doctrine
of
minimum
contacts
from
international
shoe
that
the
cause
of
action
simply
did
not
arise
out
of
those
contacts.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
your
honor,--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--the
constitutional
due
process
which
is
the
argument
i
am
proposing
to
this
court
is
the
due
process
which
should
be
accorded
to
this
defendant.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
if
this
defendant
constitutionally
cannot
be
subject
to
suit
this
court
should
not
find
jurisdiction
where
he
can
be
sued
simply
because
the
plaintiffs
are
united
states
citizens.
i
do
not
believe
as
a
matter
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
a
u.s.
citizen
is
guaranteed
a
forum
for
any
causes
of
action
on
any
basis
in
this
country.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
argument
of
my
adversary.
this
court
because
they
are
the
united
states
says
it
must
find
a
forum.
i
think
that
in
this
case
under
the
present
rulings
of
this
court
there
is
no
basis
because
of
the
contacts
of
helicol
with
the
jurisdiction
in
texas...
there
is
no
basis
for
holding
helicol
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
texas
on
this
cause
of
action.
my
adversary
has
not
disputed
the
fact
that...
what
he
is
relying
on
are
solely
the
purchases
of
capital
equipment
in
texas
and
a
single
contract
discussion
which
lasted
only
about
two
hours
in
the
city
of
houston,
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
he
is
claiming
that
my
client
is
subject
to
suit
on
a
cause
of
action
which
happened
in
south
america.
i
suggest
to
the
court--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--your
honor,
on
those
facts
alone
i
would
state
they
could
not
sue.
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
i
understand
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
to
a
denial
of
certiorari
in
the
lakeside
case.
there
was
a
discussion
of
whether
those
facts
alone
were
sufficient
to
form
a
basis
of
jurisdiction
over
a
defendant
simply
on
a
telephone
call
or--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--that
is
pretty
close
to
the
same.
i
would
say
that
there
would
be...
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
prepared
to
say
that
that
satisfies
even
the
minimum
contacts
doctrine
of
international
shoe.
it
has
got
to
be
more
than
that.
that
would
be
my
position,
your
honor,
although
admittedly
it
is
a
close
case.
in
volkswagen,
of
course,
the
cause
of
action
did
arise
in
oklahoma
and
this
court
nevertheless
with
respect
to
two
regional
distributors
found
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
over
those
defendants.
following
the
rationale
i
believe
of
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
i
do
not
think
that
simply
the
fact
that
a
cause
of
action
arose
would
be
sufficient--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--i
think
it
is
a
close
question,
your
honor.
i
would
not...
it
is
a
close--
mr.
thomas
j.
whalen
--it
is
a
different
case,
your
honor.
in
this
case
the
contacts
of
helicol
in
texas
did
not
in
any
way
give
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
on
which
the
plaintiff
has
brought
his
claim,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
the
critical
distinction
and
this
court
should
follow
perkins
and
dismiss
the
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
submit.
