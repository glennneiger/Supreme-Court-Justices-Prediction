unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
did
the
service
bring
any
kind
of
proceeding
against
the
husband?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
status
of
that
one?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
you
know
he,
too,
is
still
in
this
country.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
as
long
as
you
are
interrupted
what
is
the
status
of
any
reapplication
now
by
the
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
that
does
not
make
this
case
moot
because
of
the
discretionary
nature
of
that
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
accept
the
fleuti
standards
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
what
does
that
mean?
you
have
reservations
whether
you
will
continue
to--
unknown
speaker
--put
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
agency
no
longer
wants
to
follow
the
fleuti
standard?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
is
it
not
also
true
that
the
court
relied
on
the
comparison
of
the
test
of
residence
where
there
could
be
more
substantial
interruptions
under
the
residence
standard
in
the
fleuti
opinion?
did
not
the
court
also
find
support
in
the
notion
that
residents
may
be
interrupted
for
a
different
purpose?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i
am
talking
about
the
supreme
court
in
the
fleuti
opinion
itself
because
that
did
not
confine
its
reasoning
to
the
examples
you
give.
it
also
drew
support
from
the
fact
that
in
measuring
residence
congress
has
allowed
substantial
interruptions
not
to
interrupt
residence.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
did
fleuti
involve
the
same
statute?
unknown
speaker
in
your
opinion
that
makes
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
where
do
you
find
the
flexibility?
unknown
speaker
is
not
flexible
is
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
flexibility?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
an
absence
of
congressional
intent
to
provide
flexibility?
unknown
speaker
if
so,
why
does
the
solicitor
general
take
the
position
you
have
stated
here?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
seek
certiorari
in
the
wadman
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
could
i
ask
one
question?
these
factors
i
think
unquestionably
could
be
relied
on
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
matter
of
discretion
to
deny
suspension
even
if
you
should
lose
here.
is
it
your
position
on
the
eligibility
for
consideration
as
a
discretionary
matter
that
every
three
months
interruption
would
be
sufficient
to
defeat
the
continuous
presence
requirement?
unknown
speaker
how
about
one
month?
unknown
speaker
how
about
one
month?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
standard
of
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
us
to
say
this
is
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
totally
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
because
of
all
of
the
factors
or
just
the
three
months?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
a
three-month
absence
which
was
explained
by
the
individual
showing
that
he
became
ill
on
arriving
in
thailand
and
was
not
permitted
by
the
doctors
to
leave
until
he
had
fully
recovered
three
months
later?
would
that
explanation
satisfy
the
government's
standard?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
explanation
offered
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
my
first
hypothetical
is
if
somebody
goes
to
thailand
because
her
mother
is
ill
and
it
develops
that
her
mother
has
appendicitis
which
is
over
in
a
week,
that
would
be
okay
i
would
assume.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
develops
it
was
cancer
and
it
took
three
months.
would
that
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
would
that
apply
to
the
one-week
trip
to
thailand?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
get
through
with
that.
i
am
going
to
give
you
one
day.
unknown
speaker
go
to
thailand
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--you
just
destroyed
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
is
no
way.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
the
statute
does
not
apply
if
the
alien
is
here
having
overstayed
his
time.
you
are
not
saying
that
are
you?
unknown
speaker
you
say
three
months
it
is.
some
people
take
a
vacation
for
three
months.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
consider
that
an
interruption
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
is
it
not
true
that
unlike
the
situation
that
arose
in
fleuti
where
the
question
is
whether
an
entry
was
made
which
could
involve
a
permanent
resident
who
is
lawfully
here,
is
it
not
true
that
by
hypothesis
under
this
statute
where
the
consideration
whether
to
suspend
deportation
that
there
is
an
illegal
presence
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
it
is
illegal
as
of
the
time
of
application
to
suspend
deportation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder--
--do
all
of
these
hypotheticals
that
keep
pushing
you
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
suggest
that
government
would
be
better
off
adhering
to
the
strict
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history?
you
would
still
exercise
discretion
in
the
case
where
the
train
crossed
the
canadian
border?
i
am
talking
now
about
what
judges
should
do.
what
standard
is
there
once
you
leave
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history?
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
statute
you
lose
the
fellow
that
goes
on
the
train
overnight.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
in
a
court
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
here
we
are.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
it
is
very
difficult,
though,
to
understand
why
you
should
apply
fleuti
to
a
different
statute
and
to
an
alien
who
is
illegally
here,
not
someone
who
has
permanent
resident
status.
it
is
just
hard
to
understand
your
position
at
all
on
this
thing.
i
agree.
why
did
the
government
not
seek
certiorari
in
wadman?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
were
not
there
and
probably
were
not
even
born
then.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
is
it
not
true
that
in
last
analysis
the
question
is
whether
these
decisions
shall
be
made
by
congress,
by
private
bills
or
by
the
attorney
general?
in
other
words,
if
you
prevail
they
still
have
the
remedy
they
used
to
have
before
the
statute
was
enacted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg,
if
the
statute
simply
allows
discretion
in
the
attorney
general
assuming
someone
has
been
continuously
present
here
for
that
interval
of
time
to
grant
relief
or
not,
how
can
you
argue
that
it
is
moot?
your
argument
is
really
that
we
should
defer
to
the
administrative
proceedings
and
let
them
decide
it
because
it
might
become
moot,
but
it
certainly
is
not
moot
today
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
she
met
all
the
qualifications,
is
there
not
a
residuum
of
discretion
in
the
attorney
general
whether
to
apply
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
deferral.
it
is
not
technically
moot
today
is
it?
unknown
speaker
let's
just
say
it
is
not
moot
today
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
would
simply
allow
an
alien
who
can
postpone
the
inevitable
for
a
while
to
come
in
at
the
end
by
virtue
of
seven
years'
residence
even
though
three
or
four
years
might
have
been
simply
pursuant
to
fighting
something
that
the
alien
ultimately
loses.
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg,
we
have
been
testing
hypotheticals
from
three
months
down.
you
obviously
think
three
months
is
not
a
serious
interruption.
what
about
four,
five,
six
or
seven
months?
i
will
put
the
questions
all
in
one.
you
tell
me
where
the
cutoff
is.
unknown
speaker
here
we
are
dealing
with
three
months
so
let's
start
there.
unknown
speaker
you
say
second-guessing
by
the
immigration
judges.
who
do
you
think
the
immigration
judges
are
second-guessing?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
a
very
good
reason
for
going
back
to
the
statutory
language
which
we
are
dealing
with
of
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
a
continuous
period
of
not
less
than
seven
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
is
not
how
the
government
"wants
the
problem
solved".
the
question
is
what
congress
intended
by
that
statute
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
answer
my
last
question
whether
it
does
not
depend
on
the
intent
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
proposition
that
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
equitable
remedy
as
you
put
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
legislative
history
indicated
the
desire
for
a
fairly
literal
interpretation.
you
do
not
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
argument
that
one
might
well
make
to
congress,
but
where
do
you
find
that
congres
has
accepted
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
you
responded
to
my
question.
what
about
six
months
if
the
interruption
had
been
six
months
and
unexplained?
unknown
speaker
whose
burden
is
it
to
show
and
explain
those
things?
unknown
speaker
did
he
show
that
he
had
an
illness
while
he
was
abroad,
for
example,
as
one
reasonable
explanation
for
prolonging
the
absence?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
draw
this
line?
unknown
speaker
yes.
six
months?
twelve
months?
unknown
speaker
the
government
has
conceded
if
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
office
correctly
that
if
an
explanation
could
be
made
that
the
man
was
ill
and
could
not
return
that
would
be
satisfactory.
what
explanation
was
offered
here.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
that
if
the
absence
were
two
years
you
would
not
be
here?
unknown
speaker
or
two
years.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
get
for
the
unexplained?
i
could
consider
a
one-month
unexplained
absence
from
the
country
being
bad
and
a
two-year
explained
absence
not
being
bad,
could
you
not?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
case
because
there
was
no
explanation.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
"explained"?
unknown
speaker
did
he
go
outside
the
record
in
his
explanation?
unknown
speaker
i
have
problems
on
the
nonexplanation
and
you
have
not
helped
me
yet.
can
you
give
me
some
help?
unknown
speaker
it
was
of
record
that
she
went
to
visit
her
mother?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
but
nevertheless
the
explanation
was
she
went
to
visit
her
mother.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
it
is
outside
the
record
but
why
did
you
not
say
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
square
the
court
of
appeals
test
in
this
case
with
the
fleuti
factors?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
factors
mentioned
in
fleuti
were
exclusive?
what
if
those
were
the
only
factors.
would
the
ninth
circuit's
test
not
be
inconsistent
with
that?
they
seem
to
feel
compelled
to
say
that
the
fleuti
factors
were
only
some
evidence
and
you
could
look
at
other
evidence.
what
if
you
were
confined
to
the
fleuti
factors
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
not
with...
wadman
just
applied
the
fleuti
factors
in
this
context.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
fleuti
factors
and
the
wadman
factors
were
just
evidentiary.
unknown
speaker
and
came
up
with
this
test.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
fleuti
factors
were
the
only
factors
you
should
look
at?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
would
the
ninth
circuit's
judgement
in
this
case
be
wrong,
wouldn't
it,
under
the
fleuti
factors?
unknown
speaker
well,
fleuti
certainly
didn't
suggest
that
just
because
the
hardship
remained
the
same,
that
there
could
be
relief.
that
isn't
what--
unknown
speaker
fleuti
said,
that's
not
what
wadman
said
either,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
greenberg,
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
i
think
i
asked
your
opponent,
is
whether
congress
or
the
attorney
general
shall
decide
questions
like
this.
you
do
still
have
a
remedy
by
way
of
private
bill
in
congress
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
same
statute
that
was
involved
in
the
chadha
case
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
case
does
not
really
shed
any
light
on
our
problem
does
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back.
you
say
that
the
congressional
remedy
is
no
longer
available.
how
long
has
it
been
true
that
there
really
is
no
congressional
remedy
because
as
i
understand
the
background
of
this
statute
its
purpose
was
to
turn
over
a
group
of
decisions
to
the
attorney
general
that
congress
had
previously
been
making.
did
they
immediately
change
their
rules
so
that
there
no
longer
was
a
remedy
as
you
say
there
is
not
now?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
the
thought
that
was
running
through
my
mind
is
that
maybe
a
strict
construction
would
be
very
appropriate
if
there
is
a
congressional
remedy
as
there
had
been
in
the
past.
if
there
is
no
longer
a
congressional
remedy
available
perhaps
the
statute
should
be
construed
a
little
differently.
that
is
the
problem
i
am
wrestling
with.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
whether
there
was
a
quota
on
immigration
from
thailand
at
the
time
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
where
there
thai
citizens
awaiting
their
turn
to
come
into
the
united
states
under
that
quota?
unknown
speaker
from
thailand,
not
these
people.
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
thai
people
awaiting
their
turn
to
come
into
the
united
states
lawfully.
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
protect
the
interest
of
people
who
were
operating
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states
primarily
rather
than
people
who
were
deportable
who
had
disobeyed
our
laws?
