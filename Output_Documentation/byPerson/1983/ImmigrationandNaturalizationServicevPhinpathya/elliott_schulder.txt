mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
deportable
alien
who
first
arrived
in
this
country
more
than
seven
years
before
applying
for
suspension
of
deportation
can
establish
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
for
a
continuous
period
of
seven
years
when
during
that
seven-year
period
the
alien's
illegal
presence
in
this
country
was
interrupted
by
a
three-month
trip
abroad
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
alien
knowingly
misrepresented
her
immigration
status
to
secure
reentry
to
the
united
states.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows:
respondent
is
a
native
and
citizen
of
thailand
who
first
arrived
in
the
united
states
in
1969
as
a
nonimmigrant
student,
and
she
was
authorized
to
remain
until
july
25,
1971.
her
husband
arrived
in
this
country
in
1968
also
as
a
nonimmigrant
student.
he
was
also
authorized
to
remain
until
july
1971.
both
respondent
and
her
husband
remained
beyond
the
july
25,
1971
date.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
instituted
deportation
proceedings
in
1977
charging
that
respondent
had
overstayed
her
visa.
respondent
conceded
deportability
but
applied
for
suspension
of
deportation
under
section
244(a)(1)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
section
244(a)(1)
permits
the
attorney
general
or
his
delegates
to
suspend
deportation
of
an
alien
who
shows
that
he
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
for
a
continuous
period
of
seven
years
immediately
preceding
the
application
for
suspension
of
deportation
who
also
shows
that
he
was
a
person
of
good
moral
character
during
that
seven-year
period
and
who
also
is
able
to
show
that
he
is
a
person
whose
deportation
would
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
result
in
extreme
hardship
to
the
alien
or
to
certain
family
members
who
are
u.
s.
citizens
or
lawful
resident
aliens.
in
this
case
respondent
admitted
that
from
january
1974
until
april
18,
1974
she
was
absent
from
the
united
states
when
she
and
her
two
children
took
a
trip
to
thailand
to
visit
her
mother.
the
immigration
judge
concluded
that
this
absence
was
meaningfully
interruptive
of
the
continuity
of
respondent's
physical
presence
in
the
united
states.
the
judge
applying
the
factors
developed
by
this
court
in
rosenberg
v.
fleuti
pointed
to
several
factors,
first,
the
length
of
the
absence
which
in
this
case
was
three
months.
the
fact
that
respondent
obtained
travel
documents
prior
to
the
trip
and
while
she
was
abroad
tended
to
demonstrate
the
deliberateness
with
which
the
trip
was
undertaken
and
pointed
to
the
fact
that
respondent
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
significance
of
her
trip
on
her
immigration
status.
finally,
the
immigration
judge
noted
that
respondent
knowingly
misrepresented
her
status
as
the
spouse
of
a
nonimmigrant
student
even
though
her
husband's
student
visa
had
expired
approximately
two
and
a
half
years
earlier.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
it
did.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
husband's
proceeding...
the
immigration
judge
found
the
husband
had
met
the
requirements
of
the
statute
and
was
eligible,
and
i
believe
the
judge
found
that
the
husband
should
be
granted
relief
under
the
suspension
of
deportation
statute.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
reserved
that
and
the
board
in
turn
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
so
the
matter
was
sent
back
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
for
further
proceedings.
i
am
not
aware
whether
any
further
proceedings
have
in
fact
been
held
with
respect
to
the
husband's
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
petitioner
reapplied
for
suspension
of
deportation
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
while
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
she
argued
that
more
than
seven
years
had
elapsed
since
the
1974
trip
and
claimed
that
she
was
entitled
to
have
her
deportation
proceedings
reopened
for
a
new
application
for
suspension
of
deportation.
that
application
for
motion
to
reopen
is
still
pending
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed
the
immigration
judge's
decision.
in
addition
to
the
factors
mentioned
by
the
immigration
judge
the
board
pointed
cut
that
respondent
had
overstayed
her
visa
before
her
trip
to
thailand
and
she
reentered
this
country
by
misrepresenting
her
status.
according
to
the
board,
the
trip,
therefore,
substantially
increased
the
likelihood
that
respondent's
illegal
status
would
be
discovered
and
that
respondent
would
be
deported.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
concluded
that
the
factors
enumerated
in
fleuti
were
merely
evidentiary
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
an
alien's
absence
and
that
even
if
an
absence
increases
the
risk
of
an
alien's
deportation
it
cannot
be
meaningfully
interruptive
if
the
hardships
associated
with
that
deportation
would
be
equally
severe
if
the
absence
had
not
occurred.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
we
accept
the
application
of
the
test
announced
in
fleuti
in
the
different
context
of
suspension
of
deportation.
since
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
wadman
v.
ins
in
1964,
both
the
courts
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
have
applied
the
fleuti
standards
in
determining
whether
an
absence
by
an
alien
was
meaningfully
interruptive
of
the
continuity
of
the
alien's
physical
presence.
in
other
words,
we
believe--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
your
honor,
but
just
in
the...
i
am
arguing
this
case
in
the
context
of
the
court's
decision
and
the
issues
that
are--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--oh,
no.
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
agency
believes
that
there
is
room
for
flexibility
in
applying
the
statute.
the
problem
here,
however,
is
that
the
test
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
far
exceeds
any
flexibility
that
was
permitted
by
this
court
in
fleuti.
in
fact,
it
wrenches
the
fleuti
test
out
of
the
context
in
which
that
test
was
created,
and
it
produces
wholly
irrational
results
in
our
view.
fleuti,
in
fact,
created
a
very
narrow
rule
to
deal
with
an
exceptional
situation
where
the
literal
construction
of
the
statute
would
subject
the
alien
to
the
sport
of
chance
and
meaningless
and
irrational
hazards
that
were
noted
in
the
court's
opinion
in
fleuti.
the
court
relied
largely
on
the
analysis
of
judge
hand
in
his
decision
in
dipasquale
v.
karnuth
and
on
this
court's
earlier
decision
on
delgadillo
v.
carmichael.
mr.
elliott
schulder
you
are
saying
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
true.
the
court's
opinion
did
point
to
that
provision
of
the
immigration
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
of
course,
this
case
involves
a
separate
statute
which
does
not
refer
to
residence
but
which
refers
to
physical
presence.
mr.
elliott
schulder
in
fact,
the
statute
had
been
amended
to
exclude
residence
and
to
insert
physical
presence
into
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
fleuti
involved
a
different
provision
of
the
immigration
act.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
as
i
said
before
since
1964
when
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
same
test
that
had
been
developed
by
this
court
in
fleuti
for
the
separate
statutory
context
of
the
suspension
of
deportation
statute
both
the
courts
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
have
applied
the
fleuti
standards.
as
the
court
had
said
in
wadman
the
court
believed
that
the
word
"continuous"
in
this
statute
should
no
more
be
read
rigidly
as
the
word
"intent"
or
not
intended
in
the
entry
provision
of
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
fleuti.
we
agree
that
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility
is
proper
under
the
statute.
the
flexible
construction
of
the
entry
provision
in
fleuti
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case
protects
a
resident
alien
from
the
unsuspected
risks
and
unintended
consequences
of
wholly
innocent
action.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
i
would--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--certainly
would
not
tend
to
support
a
flexible
reading.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
only
thing
in
the
legislative
history
that
might
suggest
flexibility
is
the
history
of
the
suspension
of
deportation
statute
before
the
insertion
of
the
particular
language
at
issue
here.
in
other
words,
the
whole
notion
of
suspending
deportation
was
one
that
was
developed
by
congress
in
order
to
give
the
attorney
general
some
discretion
to
grant
relief
in
cases
which
previously
had
only
been
covered
by
private
bills
submitted
to
congress.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
there
are
indications
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicate
that
congress
meant
the
statute
to
be
construed
quite
strictly
if
not
literally.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
reason
for
our
position
essentially
is
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
is
the
delegate
of
the
attorney
general
and
has
been
administering
this
statute
has
in
a
sense
acquiesced
in
the
application
of
the
fleuti
standards
to
this
particular
statute.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
we
certainly
think
that
there
ought
to
be
room
in
the
statute
to
cover
certain
kinds
of
situations,
for
example,
the
situation
that
was
involved
in
the
dipasquale
v.
karnuth
situation
where
an
alien
took
an
overnight
train
from
buffalo
to
detroit.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
established
that
he
knew
that
the
train
was
going
to
go
through
canada
during
the
night.
certainly
there
must
be,
we
think,
some
room
in
the
statute
for
flexible
application,
and
we
think
that
both
the
courts
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
immigration
judges
have
been
applying
the
fleuti
standards
here.
they
know
the
contours
of
the
test,
and
they
have
been
applying
it
without
any
major
problems
until
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
in
its
earlier
opinion
in
kamheangratiyooth
totally
obliterated
the--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
under
the
fleuti
test
the
question
essentially
is
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
alien
should
have
considered
the
adverse
immigration
consequences
of
a
trip
abroad.
applying
the
fleuti
factors
to
this
test
we
submit
that
respondent
clearly
should
have
considered
the
adverse
implications
of
her
trip.
for
one
thing,
the
trip
itself
was
quite
lengthy.
it
was
three
months
in
duration,
a
substantial
period
of
time
especially
when
compared
to
the
two-hour
trip
across
the
border
involved
in
fleuti.
second,
respondent
obtained
travel
documents
prior
to
the
trip
evidencing
the
fact
that
she
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
consequences
of
the
trip.
third,
respondent
had
been
here
illegally
for
two
and
a
half
years
when
she
left
for
thailand.
during
the
trip
she
knowingly
misrepresented
her
immigration
status
to
obtain
a
reentry
visa
and
thereby
increased
the
risk
that
her
illegal
status
would
be
discovered.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
think
it
would
be
the
government's
position
that
three
months
is
simply
too
substantial
a
period
of
time.
mr.
elliott
schulder
excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
as
we
say
in
our
brief
we
do
not
think
that
the
fleuti
test
establishes
bright
lines
as
to
what
the
quantum
is
of--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
standard
of
judicial--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
test
that
was
established
in
fleuti
and
to
conclude
that
the
test
that
was
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
totally
inconsistent
with
fleuti.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
was
essentially
ignored
all
of
the
factors
that
were
enumerated
in
fleuti
and
said
that
even
though
there
was
an
absence
of
three
months,
even
though
there
were
travel
documents
obtained,
even
though
there
was
a
misrepresentation
about
status
in
order
to
reenter
so
long
as
the
alien
can
show
that
there
are
hardships
associated
with
deportation
then
the
alien
has
established
continuous
physical
presence
for
a
seven-year
period
even
though
she
was
gone
for
three
months.
we
think
that
that
simply
turns
fleuti
on
its
head.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
certainly
would
satisfy
the
standards
of
the
immigration
service
because
in
that
situation
the
alien
simply
would
have
no
choice
in
the
matter.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
there
was
not.
in
respondent's
court
of
appeals
brief
her
attorney
claimed
that
the
trip
was
to
visit
her
sick
mother,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
administrative
proceedings
in
this
case
that
shows
that
respondent's
mother
was
ill
or
that
the
illness
if
there
was
any
necessitated
or
occasioned
the
trip.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference.
the
alien
has
to
consider...
the
point
of
this
whole
test
is
whether
the
alien
should
have
considered
that
there
would
be
adverse
consequences.
this
was
an
alien
who
had
illegally
overstayed
her
visa
in
this
country.
she
certainly
should
be
charged
with
knowing
that
a
trip
abroad
certainly
a
lengthy
trip
abroad--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--in
the
case
of
an
alien
who
had
been
here
illegally
i
would
say--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--in
the
case
of
an
alien
who
has
been
here
illegally
and
leaves
while
the
alien
is
here
illegally
i
would
submit
that
that
alien
might
very
well
be
found
not
to
have--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
think
the
alien
would
not
be
able
to
meet
the
fleuti
test
absolutely
because
any
alien
who
is
here
illegally--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that
is
not
true.
there
are--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
well
wadman
itself
involved
an
alien
who
had
been
here
lawfully
prior
to
the
trip,
and
the
factors--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
the
question
is
whether
an
absence
is
meaningfully
interruptive
of
the
continuity
of
the
alien's
physical
presence
in
the
country.
that
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
would
consider
that
a
disruption
in
the
context
of
this
particular
statute.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
court
should
stretch
the
meaning
of
the
statute
to
benefit
an
alien
in
respondent's
position.
mr.
elliott
schulder
there
is
not
necessarily
an
illegal
presence
before
the
trip.
in
wadman
there
was
not.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct.
in
kamheangpatiyooth
again
there
was
no
illegal
presence
at
the
time
of
the
trip.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
may
well
be
true
if
you
apply
the
statute
literally.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
point
is
though
that
the
immigration
authorities
have
been
applying
this
test
with
some
success
over
the
years
for
almost
20
years.
mr.
elliott
schulder
here
we
are,
but
the
reason
we
are
here
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
totally
jettisoned
that
test.
what--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
have
no
idea.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
that
young,
your
honor.
[laughter]
if
this
court
exercising
its
responsibility
to
construe
the
statute
determines
that
in
fact
the
statute
should
be
applied
literally
we
will
certainly
be
bound
by
that
interpretation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
correct.
as
i
was
pointing
out
to
the
court,
the
problem
of
the
test
that
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
here
is
that
even
where
the
immigration
authorities
show
that
the
alien
has
taken
a
substantial
trip
abroad,
has
falsified
information
in
order
to
return,
has
obtained
travel
documents,
all
these
factors
are
totally
ignored
so
long
as
the
alien
can
establish
that
there
was
no
diminution
of
hardship.
in
our
view
this
compresses
two
separate
elements
of
the
statute,
the
extreme
hardship
element
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
the
wang
case
and
the
continuous
physical
presence
element
that
is
involved
here,
into
one
element.
in
fact,
in
respondent's
brief
at
pages
19
and
23
respondent's
counsel
admits
that
he
cannot
come
up
with
any
example
of
a
situation
where
an
alien
could
show
extreme
hardship
but
not
continuous
physical
presence
under
the
statute.
the
upshot
of
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
here
is
that
it
essentially
converts
the
continuous
physical
presence
language
of
the
statute
into
a
continuous
residence
requirement.
in
our
view
the
test
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
any
different
or
lead
to
any
different
results
if
the
statute
simply
said
residence
instead
of
physical
presence.
but
as
i
said
earlier
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
congress
inserted
the
words
1952
in
place
of
residence
in
order
to
discontinue
the
lax
practices
and
to
discourage
abuses
that
had
arisen
under
the
residence
standard.
in
order
to
give
meaning
to
congress'
action
here
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
