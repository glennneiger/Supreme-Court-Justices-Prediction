mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
position,
one
position
in
this
matter
is
that
the
action
at
bar
is
actually
moot.
the
respondent
has
accumulated
seven
years'
continuous
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
since
her
return
from
thailand
in
april
1974.
since
the
filing
of
this
case,
therefore,
and
the
respondent's
independent
qualification
on
the
sole
question
presented
to
this
court,
namely,
did
she
have
the
seven
years'
continuous
presence,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
abate
proceedings
and
wait
for
a
decision
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
on
the
pending
motion
which
has
been
on
file
since
february
of
this
year.
the
board--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--well,
i
believe
it
can
be,
your
honor.
the
immigration
judge
in
the
hearing
found
respondent
eligible
for
two
of
the
three
statutory
requirements
of
section
244.
the
respondent
was
found
eligible
as
having
good
moral
character
and
as
demonstrating
extreme
hardship
albeit
through
her
daughter's
illness.
the
hardship
was
imputed
to
her
through
her
daughter's
illness,
and
the
only
issue
that
the
immigration
judge
did
not
find
for
her
on
and
did
find
for
the
husband
on
all
three
issues
was
did
she
have
a
continuous
seven-year
presence.
petitioner's
argument
is
without
that
she
cannot
have
any
eligibility
for
244
relief.
we
simply
say
she--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
it
would
just
seem
peculiar
to
me
that
if
she
were
found
eligible
at
the
time
of
the
immigration
hearing
as
to
moral
character
and
extreme
hardship
and
for
the
fact
that
she
did
not
have
the
seven
years
then
but
she
has
it
now,
i
would
think
it
appropriate
for
the
board
to
first
make
a
ruling
on
that
rather
than--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
technical
mootness
doctrine,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
matter
could
be
moot.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
okay,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
well,
it
is
our
position
that
the
respondent
was
eligible
then
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
but
since
there
was
an
adverse
decision
on
that
one
issue
and
since
seven
years
has
passed
we
did
not
see
why
the
respondent
should
get
a
hearing
on
that
matter
prior
to
coming
to
this
tribunal.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
listening
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
my
argument.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
can
be
a
purely
mechanical
test
as
to
one
day
cut
of
the
country
or
three
weeks
out
of
the
country
because
we
are
dealing
with
human
beings
and
everybody--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--all
right.
depending
upon
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
case
the
immigration
judge
firstly
has
to
make
a
decision
whether
based
or
the
precedent
decisions
that
are
used
here,
the
fleuti,
the
wadman
doctrine,
the
kamheangpatiyooth
standard
announced
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit,
making
it
an
individual
determination
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
surrounding
each
of
the
three
elements
of
section
244,
being
the
trier
of
fact
does
he
feel,
does
the
immigration
judge
feel
that
that
person's
entry
constituted
a
break
in
a
seven-year
period.
if
you
do
not
have
some
type
of
standard
like
that
what
you
will
have
in
every
immigration
court
around
the
united
states
is
second-guessing
by
immigration
judges
because
nobody
has
a
standard
to
propound.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
each
other
in
effect,
your
honor,
because
one
judge
in
one
immigration
courtroom
in
one
state
may
feel
that
a
trip
involving
any
travel
documents
out
of
the
united
states
constitutes
a
break
and
another
immigration
judge
may
not
depending
upon
the
purpose
of
that
trip
and
the
brevity
of
that
trip.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
it
would
solve
the
problem.
i
agree
with
your
honor
on
that,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
the
way
the
government
itself
as
represented
by
petitioner
wants
the
problem
solved.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
well,
respondent
here
believes
that
this
remedy--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
it
depends
on
the
intent
of
congress.
but
the
intent
of
congress
as
we
read
the
intent
in
this
particular
legislation,
section
244,
and
despite
the
revisions
that
have
gone
on
over
the
years
is
that
this
is
a
statute
in
the
nature
of
an
equitable
remedy.
historically
equitable
remedies
are
interpreted
more
liberally.
otherwise--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--discussions
in
the
administrative
reports
and
the
legislative
reports
about
when
the
bill
was
drafted
and
redrafted,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no,
i
do
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
believe
a
fairly
literal
reading
of
the
statute
is
fine,
but
i
think
the
nature
of
the
remedy
itself
more
or
less
tends
to
be
equitable
rather
than
strictly
law
related.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
because
it
allows
for
a
person
who
has
no
other
eligibility
for
permanent
residence
to
show
that
by
their
ties
to
the
united
states,
by
their
devotion
to
this
country,
by
their
commitments
to
this
country
that
they
can
have
the
normal
laws
suspended
on
their
behalf.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
cannot
speak
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
depending
upon
other
factors
in
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
other
family
members
were
here,
if
there
were
a
reason
for
going
abroad,
if
there
were
certain
ties
to
the
united
states--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--the
alien's,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
where
would
the
line
be
drawn?
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
our
basic
approach,
your
honor,
is
that
we
cannot
draw
the
line
that
a
test
on
this
particular
issue
has
to
be
a
test
of
totality
of
circumstances
and
that
there
is
no
better
way
to
draw
the
line
than
to
say
to
the
immigration
judge
and
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
you
must
look
at
the
factors
in
each
case
and
make
an
independent
decision
but
look
at
each
factor
of
the
statute
independently.
we
are
not--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--in
our
case,
your
honor,
none.
in
fact,
there
is
an
error
which
the
counsel
has
alluded
to.
there
was
an
error
in
the
transcript...
not
an
error
in
the
transcript.
there
was
an
error
done
in
our
brief
indicating
that
the
trip
abroad
was
to
visit
her
sick
mother.
there
was
no
evidence
at
the
hearing
that
she
was
a
sick
mother.
that
was
picked
up
and
picked
up
and
was
never
corrected.
we
apologize
to
the
court
for
that.
the
female
respondent
merely
stated
that
she
was
going
to
thailand
to
visit
her
mother.
what
our
basic
argument
is
is
that--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--once
again,
if
we
apply
this
type
of
test,
a
totality
of
circumstance
test,
which
we
feel
is
applied
in
other
areas
of
law
which
is
a
logical
extension
of
the
fleuti-wadman
doctrine
that
the
immigration
judge
can
look
at
the
factors
involved
and
make
a
decision
whether
the
absence
was
interruptive
of
the
seven-year
period.
but
to
hang
it
on
a
merely
mechanical
3
days
or
30
days
does
not
seem
appropriate.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
or
two
years.
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
you
go
back
to
the
actual
trial
judge
who
was
the
trier
of
fact
on
the
spot
and
look
at
what
he
decided
as
to
the
cause
of
sufficiency
of
the
absence.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no,
there
was
no
explanation
on
the
record.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
have
not
helped
you,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
there
was
no
language
in
the
transcript
about
visiting
a
sick
mother.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
hoped
it
was
the
truth,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
herein
has
cited
and
has
stated
for
the
court
in
their
brief
that
other
circuit
courts
around
the
united
states
have
felt
compelled
not
to
follow
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
in
the
kamheangpatiyooth
test
and
in
fact
have
criticized,
that
test
as
being
too
broad
and
destroying
any
standard
that
we
have.
we
disagree
on
that.
we
believe
that
other
cases
from
other
circuits
are
basically
using
the
same
test
of
a
totality
of
circumstances
but
are
just
saying
it
in
different
ways
or
just
interpreting
it
in
different
ways.
for
example,
the
recent
eleventh
circuit
case
in
1983,
fedalgo
valez
v.
the
immigration
service,
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
a
one-day
trip
to
canada
where
the
alien
proceeded
to
obtain
an
immigrant
visa
knowing
that
her
husband
had
died...
that
was
the
eligibility
for
getting
the
immigrant
visa
through
her
citizen
husband...
broke
the
seven
year
period
for
residence.
that
is
a
one-day
trip
abroad.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
an
alien
who
leaves
the
united
states
on
the
compulsion,
and
one
of
the
cases
that
we
have
indicates
leaving
the
united
states
under
compulsion
one-day
abroad
breaks
the
seven-year
period.
this
type
of
case
we
believe
the
ninth
circuit
could
make
a
finding
that
there
is
a
break
in
the
seven-year
residence
here.
petitioner
argues
basically
for
a
strict
interpretation
of
section
244,
but
concedes
that
the
fleuti-wadman
doctrine
applies.
there
was
no
appeal
filed
on
kamheangpatiyooth
so
we
really
have
an
inconsistent
position
that
we
are
faced
with
constantly
as
members
of
the
immigration
bar
in
trying
to
decide
is
it
a
strict
standard
or
it
is
a
liberal
standard.
we
believe
the
remedy
to
that
is
to
allow
the
immigration
judges
wide
latitude
in
making
their
decisions.
if
the
immigration
does
that
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
if
there
is
an
appeal
filed
by
either
side
makes
an
independent
determination
i
do
not
believe
we
will
be
in
a
situation
where
we
have
been
criticized
for
trying
to
go
around
the
wang
decision
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
fleuti
mentioned
several
factors
involved
in
an
entry
statute.
fleuti
did
not
say
these
are
the
only
factors
involved.
fleuti
said
that
there
may
be
by
judicial
inference
or
other
factors
may
be
read
into
it
that
can
be
used
in
determining
whether
entry
was
made,
and
they
said--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--with
fleuti
alone
without
wadman?
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
think
that
you--
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
yes.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
you
would
still
have
some
latitude
on
the
part
of
the
immigration
judges
to
say
what
is
casual,
what
is
innocent.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
if
i
understand
your
honor
correctly,
if
these
was
no
latitude
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
interpolate
other
factors
into
that
fleuti
decision,
or
even
to
say
what
the
factors
in
the
fleuti
decision
really
are,
yes,
i
think
they
that
would
be
bound
by
that.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
it
was
a
taking
off
point
for
how
to
interpret
in
wadman,
how
to
interpret
a
statute
that
does
not
seem
to,
on
a
literal
reading
of
it,
permit
anything
to
be
read
into
it
that
is
not
there
on
the
printed
page.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
well,
the
private
bill
remedy,
your
honor,
is
practically
an
academic
issue
today
because
rule
6
in
the
house
and
very
few
private
bills
are...
the
old
benefit
of
the
private
bill
where
they
would
be
introduced
and
they
would
sit
during
two
sessions
of
congress
does
not
happen
realistically
any
more.
when
they
are
introduced
they
get
voted
on
quite
quickly.
the
private
bill
is
really
not
a
solution
here.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
there
is
one
analogous
issue
in
that
case.
in
1980
chadha
became
married
to
a
u.s.
citizen
and
had
alternate
relief,
245
relief,
for
adjustment
of
status.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
cur
respondent
has
the
same
relief,
no
difference,
no
other
eligibility,
no
245
relief...
244
relief,
that
she
had
it
and
that
the
petitioner
said
she
did
net
have
it
then
because
she
did
not
have
her
seven
years,
but
she
has
got
it
now.
so
whether
you
look
at
the
first
view
or
the
second
view
of
it
she
has
eligibility
now.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
no,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
private
bills
if
memory
serves
it
was
some
time
in
the
late
1970's
that
rule
6
was
introduced
in
the
house
requiring
members
of
the
judiciary
committee
and
the
immigration
subcommittee
to
decide
whether
or
not
private
bills
should
be
allowed
to
be
introduced
on
the
floor.
as
a
result
of
that,
very
few
private
bills
ever
get
through
the
house.
in
the
senate
there
is
no
limitation
on
introducing
private
bills;
however,
the
few
that
i
have
seen
in
the
senate
have
been
called
up
and
voted
on
very
quickly.
one
was
within
go
days
of
introduction
whereas
prior
to
that
prior
to
the
immigration
service's
complaints
about
private
bills
was
they
would
sit
for
two
sessions
of
congress
as
more
or
less
a
courtesy
to
the
congressman
or
senator
that
introduced
it.
but
that
is
not
the
case
any
more.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
do
not
think
many
practicing
immigration
lawyers
rely
on
private
bills
to
assist
them
with
their
clients.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
understand.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
with
these
particular
people,
the
respondent
here,
no.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bert
d.
greenberg
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
my
last
point
is
simply
that
the
petitioner
herein
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
is
seeking
to
do
basically
what
they
are
accusing
respondent
of
of
collapsing
two
of
the
three
elements
of
section
244
into
each
other
in
effect
saying
that
if
the
immigration
judge
finds
hardship
do
not
worry
so
much
about
seven
years
and
do
not
worry
so
much
about
good
moral
character.
respondent's
position
is
that
is
not
the
situation
at
all
that
the
respondent
believes
that
each
factor
of
section
244
shall
be
independently
determined
by
the
immigration
judge.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
immigration
judge
first
made
a
finding
on
hardship
before
he
even
looked
at
the
issue
of
seven
years'
residence
or
good
moral
character.
in
summation,
we
believe
that
the
standards
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
describing
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
for
adjudicating
section
244
is
fair,
and
we
do
believe
that
the
case
is
moot
at
this
point
and
there
is
a
proper
relief
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
with
the
pending
motion.
thank
you.
