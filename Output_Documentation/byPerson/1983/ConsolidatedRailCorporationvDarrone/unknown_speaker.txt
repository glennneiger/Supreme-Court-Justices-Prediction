unknown
speaker
your
opponents
say
that
that
wasn't
discussed
in
congress
at
any
point.
are
they
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
is
3,000
pages.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
explanation
why
it
wasn't
even
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
definition
of
remedial
legislation?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
legislation
such
as
we
were
discussing
in
the
preceding
case
provides
for
remedies
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
conditions
on
which
the
funds
are
given.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
those
are
remedial
provisions?
unknown
speaker
then
your
definition
of
remedial
really
means
something
which
grants
a
private
cause
of
action
to
somebody.
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
legislation
parallel
in
many
ways
to
title
9,
where
the
court
in
the
cannon
case
found
there
was
a
private
right
of
action,
that
it
was
in
effect
remedial,
to
use
your
terms,
and
how
do
you
distinguish
the
analysis
that
should
be
made
here
from
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
the
damages
question
wasn't
even
argued
below,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
why
should
we
depart
from
our
normal
practice
and
get
into
it
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
should
have
raised
it
below,
but
the
fact
is
that
it
wasn't,
so
why
should
we
deal
with
it
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
the
purpose
of
that
latter
money?
unknown
speaker
it
could
use
the
money
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is
yes,
it
could
use
it
for
anything.
unknown
speaker
they
could
pay
wages
of
employees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rissetto,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
minute?
i
am
curious.
do
the
securities
held
by
the
government
have
a
market?
are
they
listed
on
exchanges?
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
the
government
will
not
get
its
money
back?
unknown
speaker
subordinated
stock
is
not
always
worthless.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
wondering
whether
the
government
renders
financial
assistance
if
it
chooses
to
buy
securities
that
should
have
a
fair
market
value
that
approximated
what
the
government
paid
for,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
granting
all
of
that,
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
there
is
a
one-armed
engineer?
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
problem
with
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
put
a
sign
up
to
tell
all
the
passengers
they've
got
a
one-armed
engineer?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you
it
is
beyond
us,
but
i
mean
i'd
still
like
your
comment
on
it.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
that,
mr.
lenahan?
in
your
brief
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
was
already
a
private
cause
of
action
intended
by
congress,
as
you
said,
why
did
congress
add
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lenahan,
the
gist
of
your
argument,
i
take
it,
and
of
the
position
taken
by
the
third
circuit,
is
that
private
rights
of
action
to
enforce
this
discrimination
against
handicapped
law
are
more
extensive
than
the
agency's
or
department's
authority.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
the
agency
and
department
is
just
as
free
as...
perhaps
you
want
to
talk
to
cort
v.
solage.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
agency
and
department
is
just
as
free
to
enforce
the
act
regardless
of
section
604
as
a
private
individual
is?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
effect
of
section
604
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
effect
did
congress
intend
when
it
enacted
section
604?
unknown
speaker
what
was
section
604
designed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
we
thought
that
604
was
incorporated
into
the
rehabilitation
act
and
that
it
does
apply.
what
is
your
response
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
remedies
of
title
6
were
made
available.
unknown
speaker
it
really
isn't
correct
to
speak
of
section
604
should
be
neglected
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
regulations
of
a
group
of
agencies.
i
think
perhaps
one
would
question
the
regulations
of
the
agencies
rather
than
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
not
if
they
are...
not
if,
as
you
say,
they
are
contrary
to
section
604.
unknown
speaker
assume
justice
white's
hypothesis,
that
the
court
were
to
feel
it
were
incorporated.
unknown
speaker
we
haven't
decided
that
yet,
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues.
unknown
speaker
how
would
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
unless
what
it
means
is,
it
is
limited
only
to
enforcement
by
the
government
agency
itself,
a
fund
termination,
for
instance,
by
that
agency.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
the
limitation--
unknown
speaker
--it
wouldn't.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
no
monetary
relief,
the
case
is
moot,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
mr.
reynolds,
the
provision
then
would
reach
employment
in
the
programs,
in
the
appropriate
program.
unknown
speaker
have
you
taken
a
position
in
this
case,
or
are
you
going
to,
as
to
what
the
program
would
be
if
there
are
federal
funds
given
to
an
entity
on
an
unrestricted
basis
that
it
could
use
for
anything
it
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
there
are
funds
in
this
case
of
that
nature.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
only
program
that
you
could
identify
in
such
an
unrestricted
grant
is
the
entire
entity,
the
entity
can
use
the
money
for
anything
it
wants
to.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
it
would
include
and
it
certainly
would
reach
employment
in
whatever
the
program
is.
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
program?
unknown
speaker
is
the
government
prepared
to
take
a
position
now,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
the
funding
grant
says,
here's
the
money,
put
it
in
any
of
the
empty
coffers
that
you
want
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
which
event
the
remand
would
be
sort
of
a...
i
know
you
say
that
it
ought
to
be
remanded
to
really
define
the
program,
but
it
would
be
a
rather
hollow
gesture
if
a
good
deal
of
this
money
is
on
an
unrestricted
basis,
and
if
it
is,
that
means
the
entire
entity.
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
be
rebutted
with
respect
to
the
money
that
goes
to
conrail
on
an
unrestricted
basis?
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
program
be
unfunded?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reynolds,
i
am
confused
by
your
use
of
the
word
"program".
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you.
but
as
i
read
section
504,
it
says
that
"no
other
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
person
shall
be
subject
to
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance
or
any
under
program
or
activity
conducted
by
any
executive
agency.
"
now,
do
you
take
the
word
"program"
to
mean
the
program
which
conrail
conducts
as
a
result
of
receiving
money,
or
the
program
is
one
that
congress
or
the
executive
branch
is
conducting
to
fund
entities?
unknown
speaker
is
the
program
tied
to
the
government
agency
that
is
passing
out
the
money,
or
to
the
recipient?
unknown
speaker
so
this
might
be...
the
program
would
be
bailing
out
railroads,
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
prior
case,
was
it,
mr.
reynolds?
wasn't
the
proposal
taken
by
mr.
bator
something
different
than
that,
in
suggesting
that
the
program
was
one
at
the
college,
and
was
the
administration
of
the
funds
at
the
college?
it
sounds
to
me
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't
be
post-enactment
history
at
all,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
enactment
history.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
weren't
arguing...
you
aren't
arguing
the
prior
case,
but
would
the
same
argument
apply
to
the
prior
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
regulations
that
we
were...
the
regulations
that
were
extant
when
these
grant
statutes
were
re-enacted,
they
were
in
place
when
congress
re-enacted
the
grant
statutes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
need
to
waste
your
time
arguing
the
other
case.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
interested
in
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
it
wouldn't
be
post-enactment
history,
would
it?
it
would
just
be
the
strength
of
what...
it's
strength
as
far
as
enactment
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
view
on
the
meaning
of
section
604
if
that
in
fact
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
remedies?
is
it
limited
to
action
by
the
government
in
fund--
unknown
speaker
--and
what
is
your
view
of
what
remedies
are
available
to
a
private
litigant,
mr.
reynolds?
unknown
speaker
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
an
equitable
relief,
in
your
view,
includes
back
pay?
