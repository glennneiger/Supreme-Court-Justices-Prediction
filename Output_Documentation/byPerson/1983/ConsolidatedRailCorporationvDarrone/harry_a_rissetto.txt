mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
application
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
as
it
was
amended
to
claims
of
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
briefly
outline
the
essential
facts
that
resulted
in
the
petition
for
cert
being
granted
and
being
petitioned
in
this
case.
mr.
lestrange
was
employed
originally
by
the
erie
lackawanna
railroad
in
1943
as
an
engine
service
employee.
he
progressed
from
fireman
to
engineer,
and
in
1972...
i'm
sorry,
1971,
as
a
result
of
a
non-job
related
injury,
mr.
lestrange
suffered
the
loss
of
his
left
hand
and
part
of
his
left
forearm.
he
was
subsequently
disqualified
from
active
employment
on
the
erie
lackawanna
by
the
medical
department
of
the
erie
lackawanna.
shortly
afterwards,
the
erie
lackawanna
sought
the
protection
of
the
bankruptcy
laws,
and
in
1976
the
properties,
the
rail
properties
of
the
erie
lackawanna
were
conveyed
to
conrail.
in
1978,
mr.
lestrange
was
examined
by
a
conrail
medical
officer
to
determine
whether
he
was
qualified
to
be
reinstated
as
a
yard
service
engineer
on
conrail,
and
he
was
rejected.
a
complaint
was
filed
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
the
district
court
granted
conrail's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
that
aspect
of
the
complaint,
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed.
the
principal
question
in
the
case
regards
the
scope
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act.
it
is
conrail's
position
that
section
504
applies
only
when
the
primary
objective
of
the
federal
assistance
is
to
provide
employment.
that
interpretation
is
based
primarily
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
it
is...
and
then
that
interpretation
has
also
been
adopted
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second,
fourth,
eighth,
and
ninth
circuits.
section
504
provides
that
no
otherwise
qualified
handicapped
individual
as
defined
in
section
7067
of
this
title
shall
solely
by
reason
of
his
handicap
be
excluded
from
the
participation
in
and
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
assistance.
section
504
as
originally
enacted
had
no
enforcement
procedures.
in
1978,
the
statute
was
amended
by
the
addition
of
section
505,
which
provided,
and
this
is
the
critical
language
in
the
case,
that
the
remedies,
procedures,
and
rights
set
forth
in
title
6
of
the
civil
rights
act
shall
be
available
to
any
person
aggrieved
by
any
act
or
failure
to
act
by
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance
or
federal
provider
of
such
assistance
under
section
794,
which
is
section
504
of
this
title.
thus,
the
incorporation
of
the
title
6
remedies
raises
the
principal
issue
in
the
case.
in
incorporating
title
6,
what
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
were
incorporated
and
made
applicable
to
actions
under
section
504?
it
is
conrail's
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
the
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
contained
in
title
6
include
the
limitations
and
particular
provisions
set
out
in
section
604
of
the
statute.
section
604
of
title
6
provides
that
nothing
contained
in
this
title
shall
be
construed
to
authorize
action
under
this
title
by
any
department
or
agency
with
respect
to
any
employment
practice
of
any
employer,
employment
agency,
or
labor
organization
except
where
a
primary
objective
of
the
federal
financial
assistance
is
to
provide
the
employment.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
interpretation
is
based
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
there
is
very
little
legislative
history
on
either
side
of
the
question,
either
with
respect
to
the
initial
enactment
of
section
503--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--there
are
3,000
pages
in
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
the
rehabilitation
act
itself
is
a
lengthy
statute
dealing
with
a
myriad
of
vocational
rehabilitation
programs.
section
504
appears
in
the
miscellaneous
section,
and
there
is
scarcely
a
snippet
of
legislative
history
that
focuses
on
it.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
the
only
explanation
that
i
can
offer,
and
it
would
be
one
by
hypothesis
rather
than
by
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
is
that
congress
understood
what
they
meant
in
title
6.
they
understood
the
coverage
of
title
6,
and
they
were
simply
incorporating
title
6
into
section
504.
both
in
the
initial
passage
of
section
504,
there
is
almost
an
identical
similarity
in
the
language
between
section
504
and
section
601
of
title
6,
and
in
addition,
when
they
amended
the
statute
in
1978
and
incorporated
the
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
of
title
6
to
enforce
section
504.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
601
itself,
without
even
looking
at
section
604
of
the
act,
supports
an
inference
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
regulate
federal
programs
with
respect
to
employment
practices,
except
where
the
federal
program
had
as
its
primary
objective
employment.
whatever
ambiguity
may
have
existed
in
the
language
of
section
601
as
it
was
originally
proposed
was
rectified
when
congress
passed
section
604
of
the
act,
which
clearly
prohibited
or
clearly
limited
the
use
of
section
601
for
employment
discrimination,
and
with
respect
to
section
604
and
section
601,
there
is
some
legislative
history,
and
the
legislative
history
supports
a
limiting
interpretation
of
section
601
and
604.
now,
in
the
north
haven
case,
dealing
with
the
third
statute,
that
has
language
similar
to
section
504
and
section
601,
this
court
considered
whether
or
not
title
9
of
the
education
act
amendments
apply
broadly
to
all
programs
receiving
federal
assistance
with
respect
to
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap,
or
conversely,
whether
it
applied
narrowly
only
when
the
primary
objective
of
the
program
for
assistance
was
to
provide
employment,
and
they
opted
for
the
latter
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
the
north
haven
decision
was
important,
if
not
instrumental
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
title
9
and
the
north
haven
decision
is
inapposite
for
several
reasons,
the
first
of
which
is
that
title
9
has
its
own
enforcement
procedures.
it
did
not
incorporate
title
6.
the
enforcement
procedures
set
out
in
title
9
do
not
include
an
analogue
to
section
604.
secondly,
during
the
legislative
consideration
of
title
9
amendments,
a
provision
identical
or
similar,
significantly
identical
to
section
604
was
offered
and
proposed
in
congress
and
was
rejected
by
congress
during
the
conference
on
the
legislation,
so
thus
the
court
in
north
haven
looked
to
the
rejection
of
section
604
as
an
indication
of
a
legislative
intent
to
construe
the
title
9
more
broadly
than
title
6
had
been
construed.
and
finally,
there
was
positive
legislative
history
identified
in
the
court's
opinion
in
north
haven
evidencing
an
intention
to
construe
that
statute
more
broadly
than
title
9.
in
contrast,
with
respect
to
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
title
6
does
not...
is
specifically
incorporated
in
section
504.
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
or
attempted
to
exclude
section
604
from
the
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
of
title
6
that
were
incorporated
into
section
504
as
an
enforcement
mechanism,
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
section
604
was
not
intended
to
be
applied
to
actions
under
section
504.
we
believe
that
section
504
was
intended
to
focus
on
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
federal
assistance,
and
in
the
context
of
allegations
of
work
place
discrimination,
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
federal
assistance
exist
only
when
the
primary
objective
of
the
federal
assistance
is
to
provide
employment,
and
this
is
even
more
so
the
case
under
section
504
than
under
title
6
and
title
9.
the
primary
objectives
of
title
6
and
title
9
are
to
require
the
employer
to
present
from
considering
an
applicant
or
an
employee's
race,
sex,
national
origin,
or
color
in
making
employment-related
decisions.
if
an
employer
acts
on
the
basis
of
an
employee's
or
an
applicant's
race
or
sex,
the
employer
should
know
that
he
is
either
on
shaky
ground
or
he
may
be
violating
the
act.
on
the
other
hand,
with
respect
to
handicapped
discrimination,
allegations
of
handicapped
discrimination,
when
an
employer
considers
an
application
or
a
personnel
action
relating
to
a
handicapped
employee,
he
is
almost
always
forced,
or
she
is
almost
always
forced
to
focus
on
the
handicap,
the
nature
of
the
handicap,
because
the
statute
itself
requires
the
protections
of
the
act
to
handicapped
persons
who
are
otherwise
qualified
for
employment.
so,
in
practice,
when
an
employer
considers,
as
in
the
case
of
mr.
lestrange,
whether
mr.
lestrange
is
qualified
to
be
a
yard
service
engineer
on
conrail,
he
is
not
being
asked
to
consider
whether
mr.
lestrange
is
qualified
other
than
the
fact
that
he
is
missing
a
portion
of
his
left
arm.
rather,
he
is
being
asked
to
consider
whether
that
handicap
itself
disqualifies
mr.
lestrange
from
employment
on
conrail.
and
i
believe
that
that
distinction
between
the
acts
buttresses
an...
a
narrowing
interpretation
of
section
504
that
would
direct
the
statute
to
the
program
that
is
being
considered,
and
in
the
context
of
employment
discrimination,
the
program
has
to
be
related
to
employment.
otherwise,
section
504
assumes
a
range
of
remedial
legislation,
and
it
is
our
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
enact
remedial
legislation
when
it
passed
section
504.
if
one
examines
the
1978--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--remedial
legislation
is
when
the
primary
purpose
of
the
legislation
is
to
provide
a
remedy
for
a
wrong
that
is
identified
in
the
statute.
i
think
title
7
is
a
model
of
remedial
legislation.
i
would
distinguish
remedial
legislation
from
legislation
where
the
principal
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
obtain
compliance.
funding
legislation
that
puts
conditions
on
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
has
as
its
primary
purpose
compliance.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
yes,
it
does,
and
section
504
does.
in
section
504,
it
provides
the
title
6
remedies,
which
are
essentially
debarment
or
actions
otherwise
permitted
by
law,
so
that--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--those
are
remedial
provisions,
but
the
primary
purpose
of
the
provisions
is
to
obtain
compliance.
they
are
in
essence
prospective
in
nature.
they
operate
that
a
recipient
of
federal
assistance
can
come
into
compliance
with
the
objectives
of
the
act
by
agreeing
to
follow
the
requirements
of
section
504.
they
do
not
necessarily
comprehend
remedy
victims
of
an
unlawful
act
in
the
past.
that
is
the
primary
purpose
of
title
7.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
i
think
the
remedy
could
be
provided
by
someone
else
having...
a
governmental
cause
of
action
could
also
be
remedial
in
character.
normally,
private
causes
of
action
where
the
purpose
is
to
not
ensure
compliance
with
the
statute,
but
to
vindicate
and
remedy
the
effects
of
a
prior
unlawful
act
would
be
a
remedial
statute,
and
whether
that
action
was
initiated
by
an
employee
or
a
person
aggrieved
or
by
the
united
states
government
on
the
employee's
behalf,
i
think,
is
less
important
than
the
purpose
of
the
cause
of
action,
and
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
context
of
section
504,
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
was
to
ensure
that
federal
funds
were
not
expended
in
the
context
of
discrimination,
that
they
weren't
being
used
by
employers
and
by
entities
to
discriminate
on
behalf
of
handicapped
individuals.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
we
believe
that
in
the
cannon
case,
that
they
recognized
the
private
cause
of
action,
and
as
a
result
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
guardians
case
under
title
6,
we
have
conceded
in
our
reply
brief
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
title
6...
under
title
6
and
under
section
504,
in
the
context
of
a
handicap
discrimination
complaint.
however,
we
believe
that
the
purposes
of
the
private
cause
of
action
that
are
created
should
be
consistent
with
the
funding
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
should
be
designed
to
bring
the
employer
into
compliance,
and
that
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
intent
can
be
achieved
without
awarding
compensatory
damages
and
retrospective
relief
to
a
person
who
is
aggrieved
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
and
that
really
is
the
third
argument,
and
the
one
that
must
necessarily
be
reached
by
the
court
in
this
case,
because
if
the
complainant
is
not
entitled
to
compensatory
damages
or
monetary
relief
under
this
act,
then
the
case
is
moot,
because
there
is
no
basis
for
injunctive
relief
under
the...
because
mr.
lestrange
has
passed
away.
so,
we
believe
that
a
question
that
the
court
should
consider
is
the
propriety
of
monetary
damages,
and
that
essentially
is
a
question
of
legislative
intent.
what
did
the
court
intend
when
they
enacted
section
504?
what
did
they
intend
when
they
adopted
the
remedies--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i
am
sorry.
yes,
your
honor.
what
did
congress
intend
when
they
applied
or
incorporated
the
remedies
contained
in
title
6?
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
damage
question
is
not
resolved,
then
we
will
have
to
start
all
over
again
with
the
district
court,
and
determine--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--mr.
lestrange
was
alive
below,
and
he
had
a
live
claim
for
injunctive
relief,
and
that
injunctive
relief
entitled
him...
it
kept
the
case
alive,
notwithstanding
the
disposition
of
the
damages
question.
the
case
below
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
section
504,
relying
on
the
trageser
line
of
cases,
but
now,
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
this
case,
we
were
informed
that
mr.
lestrange
has
died,
so
therefore
the
damage
question
is
before
the
court.
if
the
court
simply
remands
the
case
back
to
the
district
court,
then
we
have
to
start
from
scratch
again
on
entitlement
to
damages
under
section...
or
monetary
relief
under
section
504,
and
the
prospect
of
wending
our
way
through
again
on
that
issue
we
think
presents
considerations
of
judicial
administration
that
would
prey
on
the
court
to
answer
the
question
in
the
context
of
this
case.
it
is
simply
a
question
of
law.
is
a
complainant
under
section
504
entitled
to
compensatory
damages
or
monetary
damages?
i
think
the
third
issue
in
the
case
is
really
the
program
specific
question
that
was
presented
earlier
this
morning
in
the
grove
city
case,
and
that
is,
what
happens
when
a
recipient
of
federal
assistance
does
not
receive
that
assistance
with
respect
to
a
particular
program
or
activity?
in
the
normal
case,
federal
assistance
is
received
to
build
a
building,
to
perform,
to
subsidize
in
the
system
some
kind
of
specific
program,
be
it
a
public
works
project
or
otherwise.
however,
in
the
case
of
conrail,
conrail
received
two
kinds
of
federal
money.
it
received
title
5
funds
to
assist
in
the
payment
of
labor
protective
provisions
required
by
title
5,
and
it
received
funds
in
the
form...
in
return
for
stocks
and
debentures
that
were
given
to
the
united
states
railway
association.
in
essence,
the
scope
of
those
forms
of
assistance--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--that
latter
money
was
designed
to
keep
conrail
afloat,
and
hopefully
enable
it
to
operate
as
a
profitable
railroad.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
the
financing
agreement
is
very
broad.
it
ranged
from
track
rehabilitation--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes,
they
could
use
it
for
anything.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
yes,
they
could
have
paid
wages
of
employees
with
it,
and
the
question
then
is,
in
the
case
of
unrestricted
money,
does
that
require
an
institutional
application
of
section
504?
and
that
again
is
also
a
question
of
legislative
policy,
what
did
congress
intend?
in
the
case
of
conrail,
we
are
dealing
with
an
entity
that
received
a
lot
of
money
from
the
government,
$3.2
billion
in
federal
assistance.
but
the
same
question
applies
to
a
smaller
entity
that
receives
government
federal
impact
aid
in
the
amount
of
$40,000
or
$50,000.
if
that
federal
impact
aid
is
not
directed
to
a
particular
program,
does
the
obligations
and
the
liabilities
under
section
504
apply
to
every
personnel
decision
that
was
made
by
that
institution?
if
monetary
damages
or
monetary
liability
is...
if
monetary
liability
is
available
as
a
remedy
for
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap,
then
does
that
apply
to
every
employment
decision
being
made
by
the
institution
that
receives
a
small
amount
of
money?
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
no,
they
aren't.
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
is
presently
under
consideration
in
the
northeast
rail
service
act.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
the
government
has
agreed
to
subordinate
the
preferred
stock
in
the
event
that
conrail
has
successfully
conveyed
to
another...
to
another
entity.
the
preferred
stock--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--it
is
only
worthless...
well,
it
may
have
value
if
conrail
in
the
form
of
a
subsequent
entity
subsequently
goes
into
bankruptcy.
in
that
situation,
the
subordinated
stock
would
have
value
and
the
government
would
make
a
claim
under
it,
but
under
nurser,
other
than
that
contingency,
the
subordinated
stock
would
not
carry
value
to
the
government.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
that
is
not
this
case,
your
honor.
the
parties
throughout
the
litigation
have
acknowledged
that
conrail
has
received
federal
assistance
from
the
government.
when
congress
intends
to
apply
monetary
remedies
and
attach
obligations
to
the
receipt
of
federal
assistance,
or
when
they
intend
to
establish
a
remedy
that
carries
a
monetary
liability
or
obligation
to
it,
they
ordinarily
do
it
pretty
clearly.
the
education
of
all
handicapped
children
act,
title
7,
the
age
discrimination
act
all
carry
with
them
a
specific
either
monetary
remedy
or
investment
of
discretion
in
the
district
courts
to
determine
whether
a
monetary
remedy
is
appropriate.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
case
of
section
504,
the
monetary
remedy
is
not
established
in
the
statute.
in
1978,
when
title
6
was
incorporated
as
part
of
the
rights
and
remedies,
title
6
itself,
to
the
extent
that
it
had
been
in
force
through
governmental
actions
or
private
causes
of
action,
had
not
established
a
remedy
of
monetary
damages.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
congressional
intent,
that
they...
that
congress
intended
to
require
more
than
an
entity
remained
in
compliance
with
the
act.
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
just
two
short
points,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
it
was
recently
mentioned
that
the
hew
regulations
were
in
existence
in
1978,
and
constitute
enactment
history.
the
critical
reference
to
the
hew
regulations
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1978
amendments
appear
on
page
a16
of
our
petition
for
cert,
and
are
quoted
as
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
and
it
is
a
very
small
paragraph,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
i
could
read
it.
"it
is
the
committee's
understanding
that
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
with
respect
to
the
procedures,
remedies,
and
rights
under
section
504
conform
with
those
promulgated
under
title
6.
"
"thus
this
amendment
codifies
existing
practice
as
a
specific
statutory
requirement.
"
now,
that
quoted
portion
could
mean
either
one
or
two
things,
that
in
fact
there
is
no
antagonism
between
title
6
and
the
hew
regulations,
and
i
believe
there
is...
the
evidence
or
the
legislative
history
of
title
6
and
its
applicability
to
employment
is
very
clear,
or
alternatively
that
the
regulations
are
not
in
conformity
with
the
language
of
title
6,
and
therefore
the
report
and
the
representation
made
to
congress
in
the
legislative
history
regarding
the
hew
regulations
are
erroneous.
we
believe
that
the
enactment
legislative
history
either
supports
conrail's
position
that
title
6
does
apply
to
section
504
or
that
the
references
to
the
hew
regulations
that
appear
in
the
legislative
history
are
misleading
and
should
not
be
given
weight
by
the
court.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
one
that
at
the
conclusion
of
respondent's
argument,
he
argued
that
if
respondent's
interpretation
of
section
504
is
not
adopted,
conrail
would
be
able
to
discriminate
with
impunity.
i
think
there
are
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
that
when
title
6
was
originally
passed,
it
was
passed
and
had
a
very
narrow
scope
as
it
applied
to
employment.
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
establishes
that,
both
through
the
legislative
history
relating
to
601
and
604.
that
narrow
scope
left
a
group
of
people,
including
public
employees
and
educational
employees,
without
a
remedy
for
employment
discrimination,
because
they
were
not
covered
by
title
7
in
1964.
they
were
not
brought
into
title
7
until
the
1972
amendments
were
passed.
so,
i
don't
think
it
is
bizarre,
i
don't
think
it's
amazing
or
irrational
for
congress
to
pass
a
legislation
with
a
particular
purpose,
with
a
narrow
application
in
one
of
its
phases,
and
thereby
leave
a
group
of
people
without
a
remedy
for
discrimination.
it
has
been
done.
i
think
just
as
a
last
note,
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
briefs,
there
is
legislation
in
more
than
40
states
now,
including
every
state
in
which
conrail
does
business
in
except
delaware,
prohibiting
employment
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap.
these
state
statutes
ordinarily
provide
remedies
which
are
ordinarily
similar
to
those
provided
under
section
7,
although
there
has
been
some
experimentation
in
some
of
the
states.
we
believe
that
plaintiffs
who
allege
that
they
are
not
covered
by
section
504
do
have
a
remedy,
and
that
conrail
does
have
a
legally
enforceable
obligation
not
to
engage
in
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
handicap
as
well
as,
obviously,
an
ethical
and
moral
obligation
not
to
do
so.
thank
you.
