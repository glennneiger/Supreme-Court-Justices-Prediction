mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
but
a
few
minutes,
and
i
believe
they
can
best
be
utilized
by
underscoring
some
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
lenahan.
the
issue
here
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
section
504
as
enacted
in
1973
prescribes
discrimination
on
account
of
handicapped
in
any
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
there
is,
as
i
understand
it,
no
issue
in
this
case
whether
the
provision
covers
employment.
i
suspect
after
north
haven
there
really
could
not
be.
the
issue
instead
is
how
much
employment
activity
is
covered
by
section
504.
the
united
states'
position
is
that
the
1973
congress
intended
section
504
to
be
every
bit
as
broad
in
its
employment
coverage
as
this
court
found
title
9
to
be
in
north
haven.
the
entire
structure
and
focus
of
the
rehabilitation
act
is
aimed
at
enhancing
employment
opportunities
for
physically
and
mentally
handicapped
individuals.
indeed,
the
very
word
"handicapped"
was
defined
in
the
statute
in
terms
of
employability,
and
specific
provisions
were
included
in
the
act
to
encourage
employment
of
the
handicapped
by
the
federal
government
and
by
those
contracting
with
the
federal
government.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
the
history
of
section
504
to
suggest
that
congress
had
more
modest
ambitions
for
federally
assisted
programs.
to
the
contrary,
the
93rd
congress
in
1973
proscribed
employment
discrimination
on
account
of
handicap
in
section
504
as
comprehensively
and
indeed
in
virtually
the
same
terms
as
did
the
92nd
congress
in
1972,
only
a
year
earlier,
with
respect
to
title
9
insofar
as
it
covered
employment
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
in
educational
programs.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's
correct.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
we
have
not
in
this
case
taken
a
position.
that
question
is
one
that
we
think
would
appropriately
be
addressed
by
the
district
court--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
believe
that
there
are
funds
that...
there
are
indications
in
the
record
that
there
are
funds
of
that
nature.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
right.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that's--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--in
that
case,
the--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
in
that
case
that
the
program
would
be
again
defined
by
the
funding
grant,
and
it
could
well
be
the
whole
entity.
there
is
no...
if--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--there
is
no
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
government
with
respect
to
the
program
specific
issue,
to
define
the
program
indeed
as
the
whole
entity
in
an
appropriate
circumstance.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
in
the
event
that
there
is,
as
the
record
now
sits,
i
think
that
certainly
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
it
would
be
the
entire
entity.
i
don't
think,
though,
that
that
presumption
is
irrebuttable,
and
certainly
the
entity
should
have
the
opportunity--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
know
how
it
would
be
rebutted.
if
conrail
could
demonstrate
factually
that
the
alleged...
that
the
claimant
in
this
case
was
indeed
employed
in
a
non-funded
program,
then
it
should
have
the
opportunity
to
that.
i
am
not
suggesting--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
don't
know
where
the
funds
went
or
indeed
how
the
security
works
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
funding.
i
am
just
saying,
i
think
that
certainly
as
the
record
now
sits
there
is
certainly
the
likelihood
that
it
would
be
the
entire
entity,
and
that
would
be
an
appropriate
definition.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
the
program
has
to
be
defined
by
the
funding
statute,
and
therefore
it
would
be
the
program
that
the
federal
government
is
funding.
in
the
prior
case,
with
respect
to
the
eeog,
it
would
be
the
program
that
that
funding
statute
defines,
and
if
we
are
talking
about,
in
this
case,
either
title
5
money
under
the
three
r
act
or
the
securities
funding,
it
would
be
defined
by
however
that
program
is
set
up
in
the
funding
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
is
tied
to
the
funding
agency,
to
the
government
agency
that
is
passing
out
the
money.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
it
could
be,
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
let
me,
if
i
can--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
am
sorry.
i
believe
his
argument
was
that
the
program
is
defined
by
the
federal
grant
or
the
federal
government's
funding
operation.
in
that
case,
it
was
a...
the
federal
government
is
funding
scholarship
aid,
and
the
program
that
was
defined
by
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
that
case,
and
therefore
it
was
the
federal...
it
was
the
student
aid
program.
that
is
the
one
that
is
being
funded
by
the
statute
in
question.
so
i
think
it
is
the
same
thing.
if
i
can
make
one
point
that
i
think
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
with
respect
to
the
regulations,
the
federal
government
has
had
regulations
in
this
area
addressing
this
question
which
have
interpreted
504
as
broadly
covering
employment.
those
regulations
were
in
place--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
about
to
answer
a
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
asked
early
in
the
argument
about
the
regulations
and
the
statute
and
the...
which
controlled,
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
at
the
time
that
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1978,
it
had
before
it
comprehensive
hew
regulations
that
indeed
set
forth
the
procedure
and
the
enforcement
mechanism
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
into
the
statute
by
the
1978
amendments.
those
regulations
defined
employment
coverage
in
terms
of
the
entire
funded
program,
and
not
in
terms
of
the
primary
purpose
of
the
funding,
and
therefore
when
congress
amended
the
statute
to
pick
up
and
incorporate
this
regulatory
scheme,
it
did
it
with
the
regulations
defining
it
as--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--no.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make,
that
that
is
enactment
history,
and
it
would
therefore
be
a
reason
to
give
some--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--with
respect
to
which...
the
regulation...
i
think
that
if
congress
has
in--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
had
an
answer,
but
i--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--well,
i
think--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--in
the
other
case,
i
think
the
relevant
legislative
history
relates
to
title
9
and
what
congress
intended
by
title
9.
with
respect
to
the
grant
statutes,
i
think
that
that
is
a
different
question,
and
one
that
would
not
determine
how
you
do
decide--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
insofar
as
it
might
inform
the
federal
program...
the
program
that
is
being
subsidized
by
federal
funds,
it
might
be
relevant,
but
not
in
terms
of
what
congress
intended
with
respect
to
the
coverage
of
title
9
and
the
strength
of
that
coverage.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
if
604
is
imported
into
the
statute,
and
we
are
talking
about
an
implied
right
of
action,
that
the
implied
right
of
action
would
be
defined
by
the
parameters
of
the
statute
as
it
is
written,
and
therefore
that
that
limitation
would
also
apply
to
the
private
right
of
action.
that
would
mean
that
a
private
litigant
could
indeed
pursue
his
or
her
rights
under
the
statute
with
respect
to
employment
where
the
primary
purpose
of
the
funding
was
employment,
to
the
same
extent,
but
i
think
that
where
we
imply
a
private
right
of
action,
it
would
be
defined
by
the
parameters
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
i
think
that
the
private
litigant--
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
--i
think
the
private
litigant
would,
if
you
have
a
violation
of
the
statute,
that
the
private
litigant
would
be
able
to
obtain
equitable
relief
with
respect
at
least
to
back
pay,
and
that
is
the
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bradford
reynolds
yes,
i
would
put
that
in
the
category
of
back
pay,
and
i
think
that
at
least
would
be
recoverable
if
you
had
a
private
right
of
action.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired,
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
thank
you.
