mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
must
first
correct
a
misstatement
made
by
mr.
rissetto
with
reference
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
that
tom
lestrange
was
qualified
to
be
a
yard
engineer
in
this
case.
he
was
so
qualified
under
a
medical
examination
set
up
by
conrail.
there
is
no
issue
in
that
regard,
at
least
at
this
point
in
the
case.
that
is
manifested
in
our
amended
complaint.
he
was
also
subjected
to
a
test
by
conrail,
and
met
almost
all
of
the
requirements
of
that
test
at
that
time,
and
the
only
reason
he
was
unable
to
complete
the
entire
test
is
that
he
did
not
have
his
prosthesis
with
him,
and
we
had
scheduled
a
second
test
which
conrail
had
set
up
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass,
so
there
is
no
issue--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
statute--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
an
issue
here...
first
off,
the
record
was
not
made
completely...
insofar
as
the
otherwise
qualified.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
mr.
lestrange
was
seeking
employment
as
a
yard
engineer.
he
was
not
seeking
employment
as
an
over
the
road
engineer,
so
to
speak.
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
there
are
at
least
three
or
four
other
individuals
in
the
cab
with
him
at
the
very
same
time
when
he
is
running
the
engine
in
the
yard,
firemen
and
other
types
of
individuals.
there
is
no
question
mr.
lestrange
could
have
performed
the
functions.
the
only
functions
of
running
the
railroad
train
in
the
yard
itself
involved
the
use
of
one
hand.
there
was
no
question
on
that
in
the
case,
although
the
court
didn't
even
consider
that,
since
they
did
not
reach
the
point
in
the
case.
there
are
three
statements
that
can
be
made
regarding
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
first,
section
504
prohibits
employment
discrimination
in
all
federally
assisted
programs,
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
the
funding.
secondly,
the
discrimination
against
mr.
lestrange
was
in
a
program
or
activity
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
and
third,
monetary
relief
is
available
in
a
private
right
of
action
under
section
504.
i
will
first
address
the
major
issue
in
the
case,
which
incidentally
is
the
only
issue
which
was
addressed
by
the
court
below,
and
that
is,
section
504
prohibits
employment
discrimination
in
all
federally
assisted
programs.
first
we
must
look
at
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
as
a
whole.
as
a
whole,
it
had
a
broad-based
application
to
employment
discrimination,
or
to...
i'm
sorry,
to
vocational
rehabilitation
and
creating
employment
opportunities
for
the
handicapped.
in
dealing
specifically
now
with
section
504,
and
also
applying
the
test
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
north
haven,
we
first
look
to
the
express
language
of
section
504.
this
language
of
section
504
does
not
support
a
narrow
or
limited
reading
of
the
statute.
rather,
it
specifically
refers
to
any
program
or
activity,
not
some
programs.
thus,
the
language
of
the
statute,
504
itself,
seems
to
indicate
a
broad
employment
coverage.
next,
we
will
look
at
the
legislative
history.
this
history...
we
will
have
to
go
back
now
from
1972
through
1974
first,
and
this
is
in
response
somewhat
to
a
question
asked
by
justice
marhsall.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
regarding
this
act,
both
prior
to
and
after
the
amendments,
but
if
we
look
to
the
legislative
history
from
1972
through
1974,
it
shows
the
intent
of
congress
to
prohibit
employment
discrimination
in
all
federally
assisted
programs,
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
the
funding.
for
example,
the
remarks
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
senators
cranston,
williams,
javits,
and
taft,
these
all,
all
of
them
support
a
broad
employment
coverage
under
section
504.
these
are
set
forth
at
length
under
pages
65
through
72
of
our
brief.
also,
and
this
is
kind
of
a
bit
of
a
convoluted
reference,
but
it
was
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
parallel
remark,
in
1972,
congress
was
dealing
with
title
9.
congress
specifically
rejected
with
title
9
a
title
6
type
of
limitation
in
section
1004.
that
is
mentioned,
i
believe,
in
the
north
haven
decision.
just
four
months
later,
congress
considered
a
parallel,
or
a
statute
which
was
modeled
after
section
901,
and
they
did
not
even
consider
a
similar
limitation
for
section
504.
in
1974,
congress
clarified
the
scope
of
section
504
by
redefining
the
term
"handicapped
individual".
actually,
in
1974,
congress
set
it
up
so
that
section
504
applied
not
only
to
employment
discrimination,
but
also
to
all
other
types
of
discrimination
as
well,
and
if
i
may
digress
here
for
a
moment,
there
was
some
discussion
during
mr.
rissetto's
argument
that
this
is
not
a
remedial
statute,
but
in
1974,
when
the
amendments
were
passed,
there
is
clear
legislative
history
which
is
indicated
in
our
brief
that
says
that
it
was
contemplated
by
congress
that
there
was
to
be
a
judicial
remedy
through
private
action
as
part
of
this
statute.
thus,
if
we
look
at
both
the
express
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
504
before
its
amendment,
this
supports
broad
employment
coverage
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
now,
let's
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
1978
amendments.
these
amendments
did
not
limit
the
scope
of
section
504,
which,
according
to
its
legislative
history,
was
broad
to
begin
with.
if
we
look
now
at
the
express
language
of
section
505(a)(2)...
now,
that
is
the
amendments
section--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--yes,
that
is
cited
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
section
505(a)(2)
is
listed
there
at
page
4...
i
am
sorry,
2a.
it
is
505(b)(2).
the
express
language
of
that
statute
indicates
that
the
rights
set
forth
in
title
6
of
the
civil
rights
act
shall
be
available
to
any
person
aggrieved
by
any
act
or
failure
to
act
by
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
what
congress
intended,
and
actually
it
is
explicit
in
the
legislative
history,
was
that
they
wanted
to
codify
existing
hew
procedural
regulations
and
make
also
that
remedy
available
to
handicapped
individuals.
actually,
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear.
the
congress
in
1978
wanted
to
enhance
the
remedies
and
rights
of
handicapped
people,
and
one
of
the
ways
they
were
going
to
enhance
that
was
to
make
available
the
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures
of
title
6.
title
6...
excuse
me,
the
amendments
in
1978
codified
existing
hew
regulations.
these
were
procedural
enforcement
regulations,
all
of
which
do
not
deal
with
section
604
whatsoever.
they
specifically
do
not
deal
with
that.
those
procedural
enforcement
regulations
deal
with
section
601,
602,
and
603.
none
of
them
mention
section
604.
so,
it
is
clear
from
both
the...
if
we
look
at
the
express...
the
express
language
of
section
505(a)(2),
it
makes
available
rights,
remedies,
and
procedures.
section
604
is
neither
a
right,
remedy,
or
procedure.
it
is
a
limitation.
also,
we
should
note
that
section
505(a)(2)
refers
to
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance.
turning
once
again
very
briefly
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
amendments
to
section
505(a)(2),
we
would
note
in
passing
that
they
added
in
section
505(b)
a
whole
section
dealing
with
counsel
fees.
if
this
act
is
not
remedial
in
purpose,
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
have
a
section
dealing
with
counsel
feels.
clearly,
the
congress
was
intending
some
type
of
remedial
portion
of
the
statute
by
the
1978
amendments.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
no,
the...
first
off,
let
me
state
that
the
petitioner
even
concedes
that
a
private
right
of
action
exists
here.
the
expanse
of
the
private
right
of
action
is
set
by
this
court
in
bell
versus
hood,
as
to
what
remedies
would
be
available.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
no,
that's
all
right.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
maybe
i
am
misunderstanding
your
question.
it
is
our
position
that
604
is
not
even
incorporated
into
section
504.
it
is
merely
made...
it
is
not
even
made
any
part
of
it.
in
fact,
there
was
no
contemplation
of
that
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
in
this
particular
instance,
with
504,
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
you
mean
within
the
context
of
504,
or
within
the
pure
context
of
604
in
and
of
itself?
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
dealing
with
termination
of
funds
and
limiting
specific
types
of
agency
action,
but
that
deals
with
title
6,
which
is
not
necessarily
completely
controlling
in
this
case.
it
is
one
of
the
remedies
which
was
made
available
under
section
504.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
first,
your
honor,
i
think
if
that
assumption
is
made,
in
dealing
with
that
hypothetical
we
would
have
to
say
that
it
applies
only
to
an
agency
action,
and
that
the
private
right
of
action
would
exist
anyway,
which
in
our
belief
was
created
back
when
504
was
originally
enacted,
and
it
is
only
one
of
the
remedies.
title
6
is
only
one
of
the
remedies
available
under
section
504,
and
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
include
section
604
or
incorporate
section
604
into
this
particular
statute.
we
would
also
note--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--and
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
they
were
made
available,
but
section
604
is
neither
a
right
remedy
or
a
procedure.
it
is
a
limitation
on
title
6.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
section
504
was
to
enhance
the
rights
of
the
handicapped,
certainly
not
to
limit
them.
we
would
also
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
current
regulations
dealing
with
section
504.
none
of
these
limit
section
504's
employment
coverage.
if
the
department
of
transportation
regulations
are
valid
and
consistent
with
section
504,
these
would
prohibit
or
prevent
employment
discrimination
in
all
federal
programs
within
the
purview
of
the
department
of
transportation.
here
it
would
be
applicable
to
conrail's
activities,
even
though
these
statutes,
the
section...
i
am
sorry,
the
department
of
transportation
regulations,
were
enacted
after
this
lawsuit
was
initiated,
because
it
is
the
law
in
effect
that
applies,
as
this
court
held
in
bradley
versus
the
school
board
of
richmond
case.
so,
our
position
is
that
the
current
regulations
dealing
with
conrail...
these
would
be
the
department
of
transportation
regulations...
do
not
include
any
type
of
604
limitation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
specifically
exclude
it.
there
are
28
other
agencies,
federal
agencies
which
have
regulations
which
are
consistent
with
not
only
504
but
with
the
dot
regulations
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
and
they
all
provide
for
broad
employment
coverage.
this
view
of
section
504
is
also
supported
by
the
department
of
justice
and
the
solicitor
general.
finally,
and
this
is
somewhat
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
white,
if
section
604
is
incorporated
into
section
504,
as
the
petitioner
would
have,
it
would
defeat
the
legislative
scheme
of
section
504.
nowhere
in
3,000
pages
of
legislative
history
of
the
1978
amendments
alone
is
section
604
mentioned.
section
604
contradicts
the
actions
and
regulations
of
29
federal
agencies.
section
604
in
effect
repeals
without
any
express
language
or
intent
the
employment
coverage
of
section
504.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
am
i
to
understand
that
these
regulations
that
you
are
speaking
of
are
not
to
be
given
deference
in
this
instance?
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
no,
your
honor.
we
are
saying...
we
are
saying,
number
one,
604
is
not
incorporated
here,
and
they
all--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--we
don't
feel,
quite
frankly,
that
there
is
any
basis
to
incorporate
them,
but
if
you
are
saying
that
they
are,
obviously
the
regulations
which
ignore
them
would
have
to
be
inconsistent
with
them,
but
that
is
not...
the
interpretation
and
the
repeated
interpretation
of
section
504
is
that
section
604
is
not
incorporated
into
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
that
is
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
the
interpretation
given
by...
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
express
language,
and
the
interpretation
by
the
29
agencies
here.
finally,
if
section
604
is
incorporated
here,
it
would
allow
discrimination
against
millions
of
handicapped
people
by
recipients
of
federal
funds.
let
me
next
move
ahead
to
what--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--because
it
limits
the
scope
of
section
504
to
only
those
programs
which
were
the
primary
purpose
is...
where
the
funding
is...
primary
purposes
deals
with
employment.
that
would
certainly
limit
the
scope
of
section
504,
a
situation
that
was
never
contemplated
by
the
people
involved...
or
the
congress
when
they
passed
the
act.
they
wanted...
if
you
will
look
at
the
remarks
of
senator
cranston,
they
wanted
it
to
have
broad
employment
coverage.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
if
that--
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
--yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
no,
it
certainly
wouldn't.
that
would
be
a
limitation
on
the
elements
of
604
itself.
in
light
of
my
limited
time,
let
me
just
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
monetary
relief.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
here
that
no
monetary
relief
should
be
available
to
us
for
its
intentional
violation
of
section
504.
we
have
alleged
an
intentional
violation
of
section
504.
the
petitioner
here
concedes
that
a
private
right
of
action
exists
under
section
504.
if
such
a
right
of
action
exists,
the
full
panoply
of
remedies
are
normally
available
for
a
violation
of
the
statute,
unless
there
is
a
contrary
congressional
intent.
we
direct
the
court's
attention
to
bell
versus
hood,
which
dealt
with
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
also
sullivan
versus
litting
humming
park,
which
dealt
with
a
section
1982
violation.
it
becomes
the
petitioner's
burden
to
show
a
contrary
intent
of
congress
to
limit
these
remedies
normally
available
under
the
bell
versus
hood
decision.
the
express
language
of
section
504
amendment...
section
504
as
amendment
has
no
such
express
limitation.
actually,
the
1978
amendments
making
counsel
fees
available
made
it
clear
that
the
private
right
of
action
existed,
and
traditional
remedies
were
available.
also,
the
legislative
history,
if
we
look
at
that
under
section
504
as
amended,
clearly
shows
no
intent
to
limit
the
monetary
relief
which
may
be
available.
we
ask
the
court
that
this
issue
of
monetary
relief
be
remanded.
this
is
an
issue
which
does
not
have
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
it
was
not
handled
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
particular
case.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
remand
this
case
to
the
trial
judge
for
a
determination
of
what
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be
after
a
trial
on
the
merits,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
trial
court
to
fashion
the
appropriate
remedy
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
p.
lenahan
your
honor,
if
there
is
no
monetary
relief,
the
case
is
moot.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
we
would
also
recognize
that
senator
cranston
in
1979
stated
as
part
of
the...
when
they
tried
to
add...
amend
title
7
to
include
the
handicapped,
that
a
back
pay
remedy
is
in
fact
available
under
section
504,
and
that
certainly
would
not
make
the
case
moot,
since
the
action
here
was
instituted
in
1978,
and
our
claim
may
go
back
all
the
way
to
1976,
with
a
back
pay
claim.
we
also
have
a
claim
for
medical
coverage
which
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
which
would
have
paid
the
bills
of
his
last
illness.
in
summary,
we
believe
on
the
damage
issue
that
if
there
is
no
monetary
relief
available
here,
it
would
permit
conrail
to
knowingly
and
intentionally
discriminate
against
handicapped
individuals
with
complete
impunity.
this
is
not
the
type
of
situation
that
was
contemplated
by
congress
when
they
passed
section
504.
we
believe
that
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
court
should
be
affirmed
in
this
case.
thank
you.
