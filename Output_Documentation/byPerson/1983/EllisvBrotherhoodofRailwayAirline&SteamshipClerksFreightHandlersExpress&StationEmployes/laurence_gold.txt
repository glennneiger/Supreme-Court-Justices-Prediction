mr.
laurence
e.
gold
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
light
of
the
discussion
to
this
point
to
state
our
understanding
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
on
this
issue
to
this
point
and
our
understanding
of
the
issues
that
those
holdings
leave
open.
the
issue
presented
here
has
been
before
the
court
in
one
form
or
another
four
times,
in
the
hansen
case,
the
street
case,
the
allen
case,
and
the
abood
case.
those
cases
in
our
judgment
establish
one
point
in
favor
of
the
petitioners.
that
point
is
the
following,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
the
court's
opinion
in
abood
at
431
u.s.
234.
"the
appellants
argue
that
they
fall
within
the
protection
of
certain
cases
because
they
have
been
prohibited
not
from
actively
associating,
but
rather
from
refusing
to
associate.
"
"they
specifically
argued
that
they
may
constitutionally
prevent
the
union
spending
of
a
part
of
their
required
service
fees
to
contribute
to
political
candidates
and
to
express
political
views
unrelated
to
its
duties
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
"
"we
have
concluded
that
this
argument
is
a
meritorious
one.
"
thus,
what
has
been
established
to
the
objecting
employee's
or
petitioner's
benefit
to
this
point
by
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
is
that
on
statutory
grounds
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
on
constitutional
grounds
with
regard
to
public
employees,
unions
may
not
spend
exacted
fees
for
contributions
to
political
candidates
and
to
express
political
views
unrelated
to
the
union's
duties
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
nothing
more
has
been
established
in
the
cases
to
the
petitioners'
benefit.
of
equal
importance,
it
seems
to
us,
the
hansen
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
union
shop
as
such,
and
that
holding
was
reaffirmed
again
in
street
and
in
allen
and
in
abood,
and
while
mr.
merrill
says
that
the
ninth
circuit
created
a
new
standard
for
determining
the
scope
of
the
union
shop
and
of
required
payments
to
unions,
again,
i
beg
your
indulgence
to
quote
two
short
passages
from
hansen
which
are
set
out
at
pages
23
and
24
of
our
brief,
the
red
brief,
and
appear
in
the
original
351
u.s.
at
234,
i
believe,
and
238
1st.
the
court
in
the
hansen
opinion
said
the
following:
"the
financial
support
required
relates
therefore
to
the
work
of
the
union
in
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining.
"
that
is
exactly
the
phrase
decried
by
mr.
merrill
as
no
standard
at
all.
and
the
court
continued,
"no
more
precise
allocation
of
union
overhead
to
individual
members
seems
to
us
to
be
necessary.
"
then,
on
238,
the
court
stated
its
holding--
"we
hold
that
the
requirement
for
financial
support
of
the
collective
bargaining
agency
by
all
who
receive
the
benefits
of
its
work
is
within
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
and
does
not
violate
either
the
first
or
the
fith
amendment.
"
now,
to
this
point,
the
court
has
not
stated
what
is
encompassed
in
the
area
germane
to
collective
bargaining
or
germane
to
the
work
of
the
union
in
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining,
nor
has
it
defined
in
particular
terms
what
it
is
that
is
political
activity
or
political
or
ideological
activity
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining,
and
the
phrase
"unrelated
to
collective
bargaining",
a
conditioning
of
the
protection
accorded
to
petitioners
herefore,
would
hardly
have
been
necessary
if
every
political
and
every
ideological
act
of
the
union
was
unconstitutional
if
support
under
the
union
shop.
and
this
case,
we
believe,
is
a
case
which
on
certain
basic
categories
of
union
expenses,
particularly
the
expenses
of
national
unions,
does
present
the
occasion
for
the
court
to
answer
that
question,
and
to
draw
or
at
least
to
begin
the
job
of
drawing
that
line.
in
doing
so,
we
would
begin
by
stressing
the
following
point.
both
of
the
courts
below,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
concluded
that
the
union
for
the
years
in
question
here,
1975
and
forward,
has
met
its
obligations
stated
in
street
and
allen
and
abood
to
identify
and
to
free
objecting
employees
from
any
obligation
to
support
the
union's
political
and
ideological
activity
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
the
district
court's
findings
to
this
effect
are
set
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
9
to
10,
again,
the
red
brief,
in
full.
we
would
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix,
pages
345
to
358
and
421
to
459,
which
are
the
trial...
which
are
portions
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
the
union's
internal
documents
establishing
the
system
of
identification
and
of
deduction.
it
provides
that
all
direct
and
indirect
partisan
political
expenditures
are
not
charged
to
an
objecting
employee.
all
direct
and
indirect
legislative
lobbying
expenditures
are
not
charged
to
an
objecting
employee.
all
dues
to
affiliated
organizations,
such
as
the
afl-cio
and
the
canadian
labor
congress,
are
not
charged
to
objecting
employees,
and
all
contributions
to
other
organizations,
such
as
the
red
cross,
the
naacp,
and
other
organizations
in
the
examples
given
in
the
union's
internal
documents
are
not
charged
to
objecting
employees,
and
the
union
has
gone
to
the
extent
of
requiring
a
detailed
contemporaneous
accounting
of
time
and
effort
that
goes
into
these
activities.
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
not
only
right
in
this,
but
that
the
union
has
gone
well
beyond
the
requirements
of
law
in
this
area
of
defining
political
and
ideological
activity.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
your
honor,
because
the
union
defends
its
right
to
charge
for
social
activity
as
that
term
is
used
here.
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
the
social
activities
are
activities
either
open
to
members
or
anyone
else
who
comes
in
connection
with
meetings
or
open
to
the
union's
employees,
and
are
a
normal
expense
of
the
same
kind
that
any
organization
undertakes--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--if
it
were
chartered
by
one
candidate
or
the
other,
it
would
be--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
would
be...
and
the
union
paid
the
bill,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
but
putting
that
aside,
we
believe
first
of
all,
and
i
will
turn
to
this...
i
will
turn
to
this
by
way
of
responding
to
your
question,
we
believe
first
of
all
that
the
statute
contemplates
at
least
normal
union
expenditures
for
such
social
expenditures,
and
that
as
justice
rehnquist
said,
we
cannot
understand
an
argument
based
on
the
constitution
insofar
as
limits
on
the
statute
are
concerned.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
did
indeed,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
the
question
is
entirely
open.
we
are
arguing
here
that
on
analysis,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
such
expenditures
are
within
the
area
permitted
to
be
charged.
at
least
the
kinds
of
expenditures
which
are
on
the
record
here,
which
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted
are
de
minimis
and
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
union's
activities
either
in
connection
with
collective
bargaining
or
union
meetings
and
the
like.
we
simply
don't
have
any
expenditures,
we
want
to
make
it
plain,
of
the
kind
that
the
chief
justice
was
interrogating
me
about.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
union's
position
in
this
case
is
that
objecting
employees
cannot
be
charged
for
activities
that
are
closed
to
them.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
they
are
welcome.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
the
quadrennial
meeting,
justice
white,
was
one
of
the
expenses
that
the
proponents
of
the
union
security
provision
said
expressly
would
be
covered
by
the
union's
security
provision.
the
language
of
the
statute
was
changed
to
assure--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
it
is
not
open
to
anyone
who
isn't
elected.
one
point
i
ought
to
make
in
terms
of
my
response
to
that
question
is
that
under
the
statute
that
congress
wrote,
no
employee
can
both
be
barred
from
the
union
under
equal
and
objective
standards
of
admission
and
charged
under
the
union
shop,
so
what
you
have
is
individuals
who
make
a
judgment
that
they
do
not
want
to
participate
in
the
union.
what
congress
was
doing
in
the
union
shop
provision
was
taking
away
the
economic
incentive
to
opt
out
in
that
way.
congress
was
saying,
if
the
union
will
permit
you
in,
and
if
the
union
represents
you,
then
you
have
to
bear
your
proportionate
share
of
the
costs,
and
congress
added
a
proviso
that
said,
if
the
union
won't
let
you
in
in
the
first
place,
then
you
can't
be
charged.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
but
they
can
be
members.
the
choice--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--even
though
they
have
made
the
choice
not
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
they
are
not
eligible
to
engage
in
the
political
life
of
the
union
if
they
choose--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
i--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
congress
took
a
very
practical
judgment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--to
us,
the
limitations
on
the
free
rider
concept
are
the
limitations
the
court
stated
in
hansen,
and
stated
again
in
street,
and
stated
again
in
allen
and
abood.
the
record,
and
i
don't
want
to
say
who
has
to
establish
it,
because
that's
a
separate
question
of
by
what
standard,
the
record
has
to
show
that
the
union
activities
are
germane
to
its
role
as
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
and
we
have
on
certain
items,
we
have
congress's
judgment
on
what
congress
believed
was
germane
or
not,
and
in
one
of
those
specific
enlightenments,
congress...
it
is
plain
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
believed
that
the
expenses
of
a
union
to
govern
itself,
a
union
which
has
been
selected
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative
to
govern
itself,
and
to
continue
its
activities,
is
an
expense
that
would
be
covered
by
the
union
shop
provision.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
different
unions--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes,
your--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--that's
right,
and
congress
made
that
judgment,
as
justice
brennan
has
stated.
congress
was
seeking
to
eliminate
the
problem
of
the
free
rider,
and
certain
representations
were
made
to
congress
about
what
the
nature
of
that
problem
was.
the
nature
of
the
problem
was
that
individuals
at
that
point
could
choose
not
to
become
members,
and
then
not
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
union.
the
union,
on
the
other
hand,
could
not
discriminate
against
those
individuals
in
employment,
could
not
get
preferences
by
reason
of
other
congressional
enactments,
could
not
have
those
individuals
removed
from
the
job,
nor
could
the
union
negotiate
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
which
were
less
beneficial
to
those
employees.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
death
benefits
are
a
substitute
for
and
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
system.
some
unions
go
to
the
employer
and
they
sit
down
at
the
collective
bargaining
table
and
they
say,
we
want
you
to
provide
each
individual
a
$200
benefit
or
$500
mortuary
benefit
to
help
defray
the
costs
of
a
funeral.
other
unions
have
historically
bargained
for
an
extra
two
or
three
cents
in
the
individual's
pocket,
and
also
provided
out
of
dues
that
death
benefit.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
they
have
to,
we
believe,
to
be
chargeable
to
the
objecting
employee.
in
other
words,
the
political
life
of
the
union,
someone
either
is
in
or
he's
out,
but
for--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
is
discrete
in
the
sense
that
you
can,
and
i
would
say
in
contrast
to
governance
expenses,
to
expenses
of
internal
communication
and
so
on,
imagine
a
union
which
is
a
functioning
national
union
and
that
meets
congress's
purpose
in
enacting
the
union
shop,
which
was
to
provide
for
self-adjustment
of
disputes
between
two
well
organized
forces.
you
can
imagine
a
union
which
did
not
provide
death
benefits,
and
that
would
be
able
to
function
as
a
union
in
that
system.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
know
again
from
the
give
and
take
in
the
legislative
process
that
congress
was
specifically
told
that
certain
unions
provide
a
death
benefit
system
rather
than
negotiating
for
the
death
benefits
directly
with
the
employer,
and
that
congress
indicated
an
intent
to
include
death
benefits.
finally,
it
seems--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--justice
o'connor,
in
those
terms,
the
language
is
extraordinarily
clear,
because
it
requires
the
payment
of
dues
by
everyone,
whether
or
not
they
are
a
member,
and
it
was
against
a
background
where
congress
was
very
fully
advised
of
how
unions
were
going
to
use
that
money.
so,
if
this
were
not
a
case
which
arises
against
the
background
it
does,
and
the
only
issue
this
morning
was
who
wins
under
the
clear
language,
i
think
we
would
be
in
a
very
strong
position,
but
we
do
see
this
case
as
one
where
the
indications
are
that
congress
intended
to
include
death
benefits,
and
that
there
is
sound
reason
for
believing
that
the
provision
of
death
benefits
is
part
of
the
union's
activity
in
dealing
with
the
wages,
hours,
and
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
of
workers.
it
is
one
of
several
ways
it
could
be
done,
and
we
believe
that
it
is
in
that
sense
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
secondly,
here,
as
opposed
to
the
situation
where
you
are
talking
about
union
political
activity,
there
simply
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
any
constitutional
counterweight
on
the
other
side.
we
find
ourselves
with
one
strong
point
for
us
and
one
point
which
is
weaker.
one,
in
no
sense
is
this
integral
to
collective
bargaining
as
internal
governance
and
communication
and
organize.
secondly,
it
nonetheless
seems
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
included
in
the
union
shop
obligation,
and
the
petitioners
are
bereft
of
a
constitutional
argument
in
this
regard
in
our
judgment.
so--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
we
say--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no,
there
is
a...
we
recognize
the
cases
to
this
point
as
stating
a
second
limitation.
there's
politics
and
there's
also
ideological
activity
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
forwarding
a
program
in
favor
of
the
equal
rights
amendment.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
activities
of
that
kind.
and
unions
do
engage
in
such
activities,
and
as
we
understand
the
court's
cases
to
this
point,
it
is
already
established
that
we
can
charge
for
that.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
would
think
that
is
not
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
it
is...
we
know
that
it
is
politics,
and
we
know
that
it
is
ideological
activity
unrelated.
we
are
not
contesting
that.
with...
aside
from
that,
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
the
test
is
germane
to
collective
bargaining,
and
not
everything
unions
do
are
germane
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i...
one
of
the
issues
before
congress
by...
created
by
the
opponents
was
that
there
ought
to
be
a
system
of
limiting
union
expenditures
within
the
proper
area.
congress
didn't
agree
with
that.
after
all,
unions
have
to
go
and
get
dues
from
their
members.
very
few
members
are
willing
to
pay
for
rolls
royces,
and
in
that
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
made
both
a
proper--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
am
forced
to
say
that
under
the
statute
he
loses,
and
that
he
doesn't
have
any
possible
constitutional
argument.
now,
whether
congress
was
wise
in
that
regard--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
yes,
there's
title
5
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
which
provides
that
union
officers
must
hold
union
money
as
a
fiduciary,
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--congress
didn't
write
the
statute
to
give
people
who
choose
not
to
be
members
that
cause
of
action,
but
the
cause
of
action
is
there
if
justice
brennan's
example
is
changed
in
one
respect,
that
the
union
does
it
over
the
objection
of
one
union
member.
congress
has
provided
a
cause
of
action.
congress
could
provide
a
cause
of
action
to
everyone
who
is
represented
if
congress
chooses
to
do
so.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
they
could
in
theory,
and
congress
could
provide
it
to
them,
but
my
argument,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
give
it
to
them,
and
congress
is
not
constitutionally
compelled
to
give
it
to
them.
congress
to
this
point
has
given
two
different
remedies,
depending
on
membership
status.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
while--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--by
the
process
of
counting
lines
and
dividing
the
cost
of
the
publication,
and
if--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
if
the
article
is
an
article
to
get
out
and
vote
for
the
union's
endorsed
candidate,
the
union
counts
the
lines
of...
devoted
to
that
versus
the
lines
in
the
total
issue
and
divides
the
total
cost.
that
is
what
this
union
does
and
what
the
lower
courts
approved.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
am
not
positive
what
is
true
here,
but
most
union
publications
either
do
not
accept
advertisements
or
have
a
rule
like
layman
versus
shaker
heights,
and
they
don't
take
ideological
advertisements,
one
or
the
other.
in
whatever
time
remains
to
me,
i
do
want
to
stress
the
point
that
what
congress
was
doing
in
adopting
the
union
shop
was
not,
as
mr.
merrill
says,
providing
a
system
whereby
the
unions
would
provide
a
certain
narrow
service
and
then
bill
people
in
the
union
unit.
rather,
congress
understood,
and
everything
in
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
understood
that
the
free
rider
problem
was
the
refusal
of
objecting
members
after
the
majority
had
selected
a
representative
to
support,
in
george
harrison's
words,
the
primary
union
spokesman,
the
collective
bargaining
agency
from
whose
existence
and
activities
they
derive
great
benefit.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
your
honor.
we
argue
that
there
is
no
rebate
issue
left,
not
for
the
reason
that
justice
o'connor
gave,
which
i
must
say
i
just
hadn't
thought
of,
but
because
the
district
court
in
this
case
didn't
simply
approve
the
union's
rebate
plan.
the
district
court
required
that
based
on
year
1,
the
union
deduct--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--deduct
from
the
next
year--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it
has
to
be
inexact,
because
one
can
never
foretell
the
future,
but
the
point
is
that
the
union
cannot
simply
take
the
money
and
use
it.
the
union
must
under
the
district
court's
order
after
it
figures,
say,
the
1975
rebate,
which
was
4.68
percent,
must
deduct
for
1976
4.68
and
then
make
up
any
difference.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not,
and
we
did
not
appeal
from
that
part
of
the
order.
we
do
not
object.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
we
didn't
appeal
from
that
aspect.
the
district
court...
in
other
words,
the
district
court
ruled
that
insofar
as
we
had
provided
an
internal
system
for
segregating,
allocating,
and
accounting
for
political
and
ideological
activities,
we
had
met
our
obligations,
and
then
added
this
additional
condition.
we
didn't
appeal
from
that.
and
we
accept
that
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
we
told
the
court
of
appeals
we
didn't
think
that
was
in
the
case.
we
are
saying
that
here,
and
we
are
ready
to
abide
by
that,
because
we
think
what
the
district
court
did
in
that
regard
was
correct.
