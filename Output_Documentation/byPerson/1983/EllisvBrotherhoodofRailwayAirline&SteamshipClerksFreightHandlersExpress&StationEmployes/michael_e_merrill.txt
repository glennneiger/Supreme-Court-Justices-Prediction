mr.
michael
e.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
a
familiar
presence
is
in
the
court
today,
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
airline
clerks.
it
was
here
in
street.
it
was
here
in
allen.
and
it
now
commences
its
thirty-third
year
of
litigation
against
employees
whom
it
represents,
disputing
the
use
of
compulsory
fees
obtained
from
those
employees.
the
ellis
and
failes
cases
before
the
court
today--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--it
is
sometimes
not
pleasant
to
be
special,
your
honor.
the
ellis
and
failes
cases
present
the
record
which
has
eluded
this
court
in
the
past,
and
permit
the
court
to
issue
rulings
upon
these
vital
issues:
first,
the
extent
of
the
union's
entitlement
to
the
use
of
compulsory
dues
and
fees
obtained
from
dissenting
employees;
second,
the
standard
of
proof
the
union
must
meet
to
justify
those
charges;
third,
the
remedy
for
dissenting
employees
whose
fees
have
been
or
will
be
misspent.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
hierarchy
of
interests,
that
of
the
petitioners,
the
fundamental
individual
first
amendment
rights
of
free
speech
and
association.
those
rights
have
existed
since
the
republic
was
founded.
on
the
union
hand,
we
have
a
recently
enacted
statutory
privilege.
the
union's
interest
is
a
monetary
interest
only.
when
those
two
rights
are
juxtaposed,
it
is
clear
that
the
first
amendment
interests
of
the
petitioners
must
override,
absent
a
compelling
governmental
necessity
for
giving
sway
to
the
union's
property
interest.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
not
make
that
assertion.
we
do
assert,
consistent
with
abood,
that
when
a
union
obtaining
money
under
the
force
of
federal
statute
uses
that
money
in
a
way
that
would
otherwise
impinge
upon
associational
or
expression
rights,
that
that
must
be...
must
uphold...
that
use
must
meet
constitutional
standards
of
the
first
amendment.
interpreting
the
statutory
scheme
here,
the
railway
labor
act,
must
be
done
from
the
standpoint
of
viewing
it
with
strict
scrutiny.
we
must
ascertain
what
congress
sought
to
accomplish
in
passing
this
statute.
we
have
dependable
guidance
in
making
that
journey
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
the
street
case,
in
the
allen
case,
and
in
abood.
in
the
latter
case,
this
court
has
ruled
that
the
first
amendment
sweeps
broadly
in
a
context
of
compulsory
dues
litigation,
that
it
extends
to
encompass
social
interests,
economic
and
philosophical
interests,
literary
interests,
and,
of
course,
political
and
ideological
interests
of
employees.
as
noted,
there
must
be
a
compelling
justification
to
intrude
upon
those
rights
and
those
interests.
in
addition,
using
established
first
amendment
principles,
the
means
selected
by
congress
to
accomplish
the
governmental
purpose
must
impose
the
minimum
burden
on
plaintiff's
constitutional
freedoms.
now,
the
specific
congressional
purpose
authorized
and
not
commanded
in
the
1951
amendments
to
this
statute
was
that
of
obtaining
payment
for
specific
services.
it
was
to
pay
a
union
representing
employees
in
a
specific
collective
bargaining
context
for
the
acts
of
the
union
as
a
negotiating
agent,
and
for
its
services
in
administering
that
contract,
and
in
handling
and
prosecuting
grievances
of
employees
arising
under
that
contract.
again,
we
have
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
make
it
plain
that
the
procedure
used
to
protect
the
union's
interests
in
this
case,
that
of
obtaining
money
from
the
plaintiffs,
must
be
drawn
in
such
a
fashion
so
as
not
to
sacrifice
the
overriding
constitutional
interests
of
the
petitioners.
as
the
court
analyzes
this
case,
it
is
of
extreme
importance
to
remember
that
the
union
wears
two
hats.
the
first
of
those
hats,
which
existed
long
prior
to
the
occurrence
of
the
statute
giving
rise
to
this
controversy,
is
that
of
a
voluntary
fraternal
organization.
as
a
fraternal
organization,
brac
can
do
anything
it
chooses.
it
can
engage
in
ideological
activity,
religious
activity,
sociological,
economic,
political
activity.
there
is
no
limit
other
than
law
upon
what
it
chooses
to
do,
and
we
note
that
this
court
recognized
in
street
that
unions
are
inherently
ideological
and
political
organizations.
surely
no
one
would
argue
that
a
private
citizen
can
be
compelled,
consistent
with
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
that
one
must
support
the
activities
of
a
fraternal
organization
in
that
light.
so,
we
turn
then
to
the
second
hat
warn
by
brac,
and
it
is
wearing
that
hat
when
it
sought
the
congressional
purpose,
the
congressional
permission
to
obtain
money
from
dissenting
employees.
it
is
the
collective
bargaining
representative
hat,
and
when
the
unions
went
to
congress
in
1950
seeking
permission
to
compel
the
payment
of
dues,
they
stressed
that
they
were
required
to
perform
duties
with
respect
to
dissenting
employees.
they
already
enjoyed
excellent
success
in
generating
voluntary
membership
support.
as
the
court
noted
from
the
legislative
history,
voluntary
membership
levels
of
75
to
80
percent
were
commonplace
by
the
late
1940's.
nevertheless,
the
unions
stated
to
congress
that
they
were
required
to
provide
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
those
who
chose
not
to
support
the
unions,
who
disagreed
with
their
policies,
who
wished
not
to
be
a
part
of
those
organizations.
on
the
limited
basis
that
those
functions
had
by
law
to
be
performed,
congress
was
persuaded
to
authorize
compulsory
payment
for
those
services
only.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
there
were
not,
your
honor.
in
the
1934
act,
no
form
of
union
security
was
permitted,
so
it
was
strictly
voluntary
unionism
from
1934
until
1951.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
that
is
correct,
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
railway
unions
had
never
found
compulsory
unionism
to
be
essential
to
their
well-being
because
at
the
time
of
the
1934
statute,
only
one
such
organization
had
compulsory
membership
provisions
in
it.
so,
we
see
that
the
collective
bargaining
representative
hat
is
that
which
congress
addressed
in
the
statute,
and
it
is
a
confusion
of
those
two
roles
that
brac
urges
upon
this
court
and
successfully
urged
upon
the
ninth
circuit.
i
point
out
that
not
only
did
brac
provide
a
limited
statutory
role
with
respect
to
petitioners,
it
did
so
grudgingly,
treating
them
as
objectives
of
collective
bargaining.
petitioners
were
not
entitled
under
this
union's
constitution
and
practices
to
attend
meetings,
to
vote
for
officers,
to
serve
as
grievance
representatives,
to
vote
for
grievance
representatives.
even
with
respect
to
the
fraternal
activities,
which
this
union
seeks
to
compel
payment
for,
petitioners
were
excluded.
agency
fee
payers
did
not
receive
union
publications.
they
were
expressly
made
inelligible
for
death
benefit
fund
participation.
only
at
a
later
time,
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
union
might
not
be
able
to
continue
collecting
for
those
functions,
after
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment
had
been
filed,
did
this
union
generously
say,
oh,
well,
we
meant
to
make
these
benefits
available
to
all.
so,
we
see
that
petitioners
were
treated
in
a
very
limited
sense
by
brac,
just
as
they
were
viewed
by
congress
in
a
very
limited
sense.
the
ninth
circuit
majority
decision
has
interpreted
this
statute
from
the
perspective
of
a
financially
acquisitive
union,
not
from
the
perspective
of
congress,
and
not
from
the
perspective
that
this
court
described
in
the
street
case.
if
one
is
to
read
the
statute
as
did
the
ninth
circuit
majority,
congress'
objective
was
to
maximize
union
power
in
general,
and
to
legitimize
charges
for
any
union
fraternal
activity
bearing
any
conceivable,
arguable
relationship
to
the
function
of
the
union
in
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
their
test
is
stated
that
it
is
anything
that
is
done
by
the...
the
work
of
the
union
that
is
germane
to
the
realm
of
collective
bargaining,
a
test
we
have
not
seen
in
any
other
case
before
or
since.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
in
practice,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
exactly
the
test
that
i
stated.
if
one
looks
closely
at
the
range
of
activities
supported
through
the
compulsory
fee
by
brac,
one
finds
no
limits
other
than
partisan
political
activity.
that
is
the
only
sphere
safeguarded
by
the
trial
court
judgment
as
modified
by
the
ninth
circuit
majority.
if
one
is
to
take
this
expansive
statutory
interpretation,
it
assures
us
that
we
will
run
roughshod
over
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights,
and
destroy
the
painstaking
efforts
of
this
court
to
save
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
such
a
construction
also
runs
counter
to
congress'
intent,
because
congress
did
not
favor
unions
over
employers.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
the
issue
before
this
court
has
not
been
decided
other
than
to
the
extent--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--except
to
say--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--the
antecedents
of
the
decision
are
certainly
present
in
abood,
justice
white,
when
it
found
that
the
use
of
dissenters'
dues
over
their
objection
for
ideological--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--i
am
prepared
to
agree.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
well,
certainly
the
issues
before
the
court
are
presented
on
the
appropriate
record
for
the
first
time
today.
as
i
mentioned,
in
1951,
congress
did
not
enact
a
statute
to
favor
unions
over
employees,
except
in
a
very
limited
sense.
it
did
not
favor
strong
unions
over
weak
unions.
it
did
not
favor
unions
over
employers.
the
railway
labor
act,
neither
in
the
1951
amendments
nor
in
its
other
provisions,
does
not
allow,
does
not
protect,
and
does
not
regulate
union
activities
in
general.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
time
does
not
permit
me
to
address
them
individually.
i
will
be
happy
to
respond
to
any
questions.
if
there
is
one
or
more
in
particular
that
justice
rehnquist
inquires
about,
i
would
be
pleased
to
address
that.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
that
would
be
the
quadrennial
convention,
justice
white?
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
can
address
the
convention,
and
i
think
my
comments
will
apply
to
the
other
paragraph
22
activities
in
question.
the
statute
was
intended
to
and
must
be
construed
to
compel
payment
only
for
union
functions
which
the
union
must
provide,
which
the
union
has
a
duty
to
provide
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative.
there
is
nothing
in
the
railway
labor
act
and
nothing
in
section
211
thereof
that
requires
the
union
to
hold
a
convention.
it
chooses
to
do
so
as
a
fraternal
organization.
it
does
so
in
part
because
of
an
extraneous
federal
statute
which
does
require
the
election
of
officers.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
believe
that
i
agree
with
the
gist
of
justice
rehnquist's
remarks.
the
requirement
remains
that
dissenting
employees
voice
an
objection
to
the
payment
of
compulsory
dues
and
fees,
and
they
did
in
this
case.
each
petitioner
registered
a
specific
written
objection
to
the
use
of
any
dues
and
fees,
but
particularly
for
anything
other
than
direct
collective
bargaining
expenses
with
western
airlines.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
well,
certainly
the
court
in
abood
recognized
that
the
first
amendment
freedoms
encompass
union
social
activities.
it
is
the
functioning
of
a
fraternal--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--it
recognized
that
when
it
listed...
when
it
rejected
the
union
argument
that
only
political
and
ideological
activities
of
the
union
were
safeguarded
by
the
first
amendment,
and
the
court
said,
we
have
never
held
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
also
cover
social,
literary,
artistic,
philosophical,
and
religious
activity.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
certainly
do.
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
authorizes
this
union
to
establish
a
fraternal
organization
which
undertakes
activities
of
a
fellowship
nature
and
a
direct
association
of
persons
which
is
not
favored,
which
is
opposed
by
petitioners,
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
certainly
does
encompass
that
type
of
activity.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
would
do
that
by
saying,
as
the
court
did
in
street,
when
it
placed
a
strained
construction,
according
to
one
justice,
upon
the
statute,
and
it
said
only
those
duties
under
the
railway
labor
act
can
be
the
subject
of
charges.
there
is
no
duty
of
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
to
hold
the
dance--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--i
believe
that
the
antecedents
of
that
proposition
are
present
in
abood
when
it
said
that
there
must
be
a
governmental
necessity
for
the
extraction
of
the
fees.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
we
can
win
the
case,
but
we
cannot
obtain
the
appropriate
remedy,
because
the
use
of
these
dissenters'
fees
has
been
expended
on
activities
of
the
union
which
violate
their
first
amendment
rights,
so
the
remedy
cannot--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--it
is
not.
that
is
not
my
thesis.
it
is
incidental
that
they
were
excluded
from
those
things.
it
is
that
they
may
not
be
forced
to
support
them
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
because
the
use
by
the
union
inflicts
more
than
a
monetary
injury.
there
is
the
intangible
injury
to
constitutional
rights
which
cannot
be
unspent,
if
the
court
will.
if
the
union
extracts--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--we
want--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--given
the
history
of
intransigence
of
this
union
and
its
approach
to
the
plaintiff's
clients--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--we
would
like--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--we
would
like
to
have
the
ninth
circuit's
delineation
of
chargeable
activities
set
aside--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
the
case
is
to
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court,
and
in
the
trial
court
brac
should
be
required
to
prove
for
the
first
time
its
costs
of
collective
bargaining
with
western
airlines,
and
to
prove
those
costs
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
we
can
only
have
a
remedy
for
the
future.
of
course,
petitioners
would
be
entitled
to
their
damages
for
amounts
paid
in
the
past,
in
accordance
with
the
proof
to
be
shown
at
trial.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
well,
in
addition,
we
would
request
that
this
court
instruct
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
declaring
that
the
union's
rebate
procedure
is
constitutionally
inadequate.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
the
issue
is
assuredly
not
moot.
no
proof
was
presented
as
to
union
expenditures
after
december
1st...
i'm
sorry,
december
31st,
1977.
the
union
collected
full
dues
following
that
date
until
late
july,
1980,
which
was
following
the
trial
and
following
the
judgment.
so
there
is
unquestionably
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
only
supposed
remedy
is
the
operation
of
the
dues
rebate
procedure
prescribed
by
the
union,
and
i
point
out
that
it
is
a
rebate
procedure.
in
the
afl-cio's
brief,
the
terminology
is
used
for
the
first
time
that
it's
a
dues
deduction
procedure.
it
is
not.
it
is
a
rebate
procedure.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
believe
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
problem
at
this
time.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
the
damages
claim
was
brought
virtually
contemporaneously
with
the
extraction
of
the
funds.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
it
was
brought...
the
cases
were
first
filed
in
march,
1973.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
led
to
the
paragraph
22
ruling,
we
pointed
out
that
not
all
publication
expenses
were
per
se
deemed
to
be
non-chargeable.
but
the
union
never
attempted
at
any
point
to
establish
the
amounts
of
money
attributed
to
publications
which
were
claimed
to
be
collective
bargaining
expenditures.
that
is
the
simple
reason
for
the
inclusion
of
publications,
that
and
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
had
an
extensive
stack
of
union
publications
to
review,
and
they
are
indeed,
as
this
court
may
know
from
its
review
of
the
record,
overwhelmingly
political
and
ideological.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
it
was.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
i
believe
that
to
be
true.
it
is
certainly
not
the
collective
bargaining
representative
for
any
of
the
craft
or
class
which
included
petitioners.
that
decertification
occurred
post-judgment,
and
of
course
the
union
could
be
recertified
if
it
were
to
conduct
another
campaign
and
be
voted
in
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
there.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
point
out
with
great
emphasis
that
congress
was
not
importuned
by
the
unions
because...
to
grant
a
privilege
to
obtain
moneys
from
dissenting
employees
because
of
its
fraternal
activities.
it
complained
of
free
riders
in
the
collective
bargaining
sense.
it
did
not
complain
that
they
were
free
riders
because
of
its
fraternal
organization.
and
the
authority
for
the
petitioners'
point
of
view
is
contained
in
the
street
decision
at
page
767,
when
it
is
stated
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
congress
did
not
abandon
the
policy
of
full
freedom
of
choice
embodied
in
the
1934
act,
but
rather
made
inroads
on
it
for
the
limited
purpose
of
eliminating
the
problems
caused
by
the
free
rider.
now,
it
is
without
question,
we
submit,
that
congress
could
not
command
private
citizens
to
belong
to
a
privately
administered
welfare
program,
which
is
what
the
brac
death
benefits
program
is
described
as
by
brac
officers,
a
welfare
program.
furthermore,
we
can
establish
that
the
union
was
a
free
rider
on
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
not
the
converse.
the
petitioners
in
the
ellis
case
were
charged
100
percent
of
voluntary
dues,
and
were
told
they
were
ineligible
for
death
benefits,
ineligible
for
publications,
ineligible
for
the
collective
bargaining
activities
for
which
payment
was
extracted
and
for
which
payment
is
still
sought.
so,
if
there
is
an
equity
at
work
in
the--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--not
presently.
it
was
following
our
filing
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
union
modified
its
policy.
however,
it
is
questionable
as
to
what
the
modification
consisted
of,
because
the
1975
quadrennial
convention
that
followed
this
particular
issue
having
come
up
in
the
trial
court
again
specifically
raised
agency
fee
payer
eligibility
for
death
benefit,
and
they
were
again
found
to
be
ineligible.
it
was
a
contrary--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--well,
it
truly
wasn't
important,
because
we
contend
that--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--it
is
our
primary
position
that
the
death
benefits
program
is
not
chargeable.
incidentally,
we
have
pointed
out--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
it
is
presently
neutral.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
and
i
might
point
out,
justice
stevens,
in
response
to
your
question
about
waste,
as
to
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
could
file
a
claim
under
title
5
of
landrum-griffin,
mr.
gold
misinterpreted
the
statute.
non-members
of
a
labor
organization
have
no
standing
to
file
such
a
claim.
now--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--then
i
misunderstood
him.
no
one
has
commented
at
any
length
about
organizing,
but
we
see
that
as
one
of
the
most
fundamental
injuries
worked
upon
plaintiffs
as
having
had
their
wages
extracted
for
use
in
that
totally
ideological
program
of
the
union.
here
we
have
the
marketing
of
the
union
as
a
fraternal
organization
and
as
a
collective
bargaining
representative
when
the
petitioners
don't
want
to
be
represented
by
this
union.
why
ought
they
to
pay
for
this
union
to
foist
itself
off
on
other
groups
of
employees?
the
harder
question
comes
when
we
look
at
the
full
gamut
of
organizing
expenses,
rating
expenses,
which
are
present
in
the
record
in
this
case,
and
the
constitution
say
that
petitioners
who
do
not
wish
to
be
represented
by
this
union
ought
to
be
made
to
pay
for
this
union
to
weaken
and
then
oust
another
union,
which
was
attempted
in
this
case,
and
the
amounts
of
money
are
most
significant.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
well,
it
takes
his
funds
and
expends
them--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--well,
it
certainly--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--it
is
a
sweeping
ideological
intrusion.
if
he
does
not
believe
in
being
represented
by
brac,
it
can
scarcely
be
imagined
that
he
ought
to
pay
for
them
to
force
themselves
on
other
groups
of
employees,
which
is
what
organizing
has
accomplished.
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
it
hurts
him
very
deeply,
as
the
records
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--point
out.
it
hurts
him
in
the
pocket.
over
$100,000
was
spent
in
three
years,
and
they
did
not
produce
one
new
member
by
the
union's
own
admission.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
contrary
to
what--
mr.
michael
e.
merrill
--the
point
is--
0
[generallaughter.]
--that
he
is
swept
up
financially
and
ideologically
if
he
is
forced
to
pay
for
union
organizing
activity,
whether
it
be
a
rate
or
straight
out
organizing.
thank
you
very
much.
