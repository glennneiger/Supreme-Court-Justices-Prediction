unknown
speaker
do
the
other
unions
just
defer
to
you,
or--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
merrill,
are
you
saying
that
any
time
the
individual
says
something
that
is
done
to
him
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
person
who
is
violating
the
first
amendment
or
alleged
to
is
interested
primarily
in
the
financial
outcome,
that
that
automatically
decides
the
case?
unknown
speaker
weren't
there
closed
shops
in
the
railway
industry
before
the
early
fifties?
unknown
speaker
so
this
act
didn't
follow
the
same
path
as
the
national
labor
relations
act.
unknown
speaker
that
is
really
not
the
test
they
stated,
is
it,
any
conceivable,
arguable
relationship?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
quite
a
different
test
than
the
one
you
just
stated.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
think
we've
decided
this
issue
before,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
we
have
left
it
open.
unknown
speaker
these
kinds
of
things.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
couldn't
have
left
it
open
if
it
is
so
obvious
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
we
left
it
open.
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
so-called
paragraph
22
items
one
by
one
at
some
point
during
your
oral
argument?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
annual
meeting?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
part
of
your
response
to
justice
white
suggests
to
me
that
you
view
our
previous
cases
in
the
railway
labor
act
as
saying
that
the
union
has
to
justify
any
charges
it
makes
to
your
members,
rather
than
saying
that
your
members
must
make
some
sort
of
a
showing
to
avoid
paying
what
is
otherwise
the
normal
agency
fee.
unknown
speaker
what
about
social
activities?
now,
i
can
see
your
point
that
they
probably
have
virtually
nothing
to
do
with
collective
bargaining
activities,
but
i
can't
for
the
life
of
me
think
why
they
involve
any
first
amendment
considerations
either,
so
it
seems
to
me
there
the
question
is
pretty
clear.
on
whom
do
you
put
the
burden
of
the
argument,
so
to
speak.
unknown
speaker
in
abood,
how
did
it
recognize
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
the
court
in
abood
meant
that
the
first
amendment
covers
a
dance
in
the
union
hall?
unknown
speaker
just
how
would
you
go
about
connecting
up
the
first
amendment
with
what
you
say
are
your
clients'
rights
here?
unknown
speaker
okay.
that
is
a
permissible
argument
from
the
point
of
view
that
congress
intended
only
very
narrow
things
to
be
permissible
under
the
agency
fee,
but
you
are
saying
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
argument
in
support
of
that
exemption,
that
somehow
your
clients'
first
amendment
rights
are
impinged
on
when
they
are
required
to
put
a
part
of
their
agency
fee
to
support
a
band
at
a
union
hall
dance,
and
i
can't
for
the
life
of
me
see
how
any
case
we
have
ever
decided
supports
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
necessarily
a
constitutional
argument.
you
could
win
your
case
without
even
mentioning
the
constitution.
i
mean,
logically
you
could.
it
would
be
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
you
could
say
that
in
order
to
justify
any
fee,
you
must
show...
somebody
must
show
that
congress
anticipated
that
the
non-union
employees
could
be
charged
this
much
to
cover
these
things.
unknown
speaker
and
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
anything
to
do
with
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
does
it
violate
their
rights
in
the
sense
that
they
pay
for
it
but
they
are
not
permitted
to
take
part?
is
that
your
thesis?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
statute
didn't
contemplate
your
clients
being
charged
for
these
kinds
of
things?
why
couldn't
they
have
a
remedy
for
it?
the
union
extracts
from
them
something
that
the
statute
does
not
authorize.
now,
what
is...
why
do
you
need
the
help
of
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
kind
of
a
remedy
do
you
want?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
somebody
to
be
whipped,
or
what?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
want?
what
kind
of
a
remedy
do
you
want?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
you
get
your
money
back
because
of
a
statutory
violation.
then
what
do
you
want?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
do
that
under
the
statute
if
you
are--
unknown
speaker
--then
what?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
want
as
some
remedy
for
the
future,
some
clear,
sharp
remedy
for
the
future.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
you
couldn't
get
all
that
under
the
statute,
if
you
are
right
in
your
construction
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
since
the
respondent
union
was
decertified
in
1980,
why
is
the
issue
concerning
the
rebate
plan
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
have
a
statute
of
limitations
problem?
ten
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
you
wanted
a
rebate.
that
means
money,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
back
into
1970?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be
all
right
then.
mr.
merrill,
was
there
any
issue
in
the
district
court
as
to
what
portion
of
the
publication
expenses
were
chargeable
to
the
dissenters?
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
was
the
union
decertified
entirely?
unknown
speaker
it
is
now
not
the
collective
bargaining
agency
for
any
western
employees?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
mentioned
the
social
particularly.
unknown
speaker
what
about
chartering
a
steamer
on
the
mississippi
for
$5,000
the
week
before
the
union
elections?
where
do
you
think
that
falls?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
union,
the
union
is
paying
the
bill.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
my
recollection
is
that
abood
expressly
left
open
the
question
as
to
social
activities
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
they
are
de
minimis,
but
if
you
did
have
that
boat
chartered
to
go
down
the
river,
would
non-union
members
be
invited
to
go
also?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
go
if
they
wished
to?
unknown
speaker
they
may
not
be
welcome.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
quadrennial
meeting?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
of
the
activities,
though,
that
is
not
open
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
non-members
can't
vote
at
this
point.
unknown
speaker
they
can
be
members,
but
if
they
aren't
members,
they
nevertheless
can
be
charged--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
they
can't
take
part
in
it.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
different
from
the
river
boat.
this
is
one
activity
that
they
can
be
charged
for
but
they
cannot
participate--
unknown
speaker
--they
are
not
even
eligible
for
the
election.
unknown
speaker
so
in
general
you
think
that
employees
can
be
charged
the
expenses
that
a
union
finds
necessary
for
it
to
stay
in
existence
as
a
union,
wholly
aside
from
whether
they
do
any
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
you
decide
whether
these
expenses
are
remotely
connected
to
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
other
than
through
the
fact
that
the
union
has
to
spend
this
kind
of
money
to
even
stay
in
existence.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gold,
wasn't
that
all
wrapped
up
in
the
so-called
free
rider
concept?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
limitations
on
that?
unknown
speaker
so
how
often
does
a
union
have
a
meeting?
i
suppose
it
differs.
unknown
speaker
they
may
have
them
every
month,
and
the
expenses
of
doing
that...
and
i
suppose
unions
pay
the
expenses
of
having
their
own
elections.
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
those
expenses
you
say
congress
specifically
anticipated
could
be
allocated
in
part
to
non-members.
unknown
speaker
what
about
death
benefits?
unknown
speaker
so
these
death
benefits
apply
to
everyone,
not
just
union
members.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
a
discrete
benefit,
that
if
somebody
who
is
not
a
union
member
objects
to
being
covered
could
be
left
out
and
not
charged
for
it?
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
not
by
any
very
clear
language,
mr.
gold.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gold,
is
there
some
item
that
you
can
imagine
other
than
the
direct
support
of
candidates
or
paying
for
literature
or
other
kinds
of
support
for
purely
political
activity?
is
there
any
kind
of
a
union
expenditure
that
you
would
say
couldn't
be
charged
to
non-members?
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
one
on
your
position,
or
is
it
just
that
bright
line,
politics...
if
it
is
politics,
no;
anything
else,
yes?
unknown
speaker
name
one.
unknown
speaker
get
out
the
vote
drive.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
union
runs
a...
likes
to
make
money
on
the
side,
so
it
has
got
some
money,
and
it
goes
into
the
real
estate
business,
or
it
goes
into
the
insurance
business,
and
it
needs
to...
and
it
uses
the
dues
in
part
to
pay
the
expenses
of
a
losing
business
venture?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
it
is
just
not
politics.
unknown
speaker
for
example,
mr.
gold,
i
take
it
the
purchase
of
an
automobile
with
a
local's
funds
for
the
use
by
the
president
and
union
business
would
be
germane,
would
it?
suppose
it
was
a
rolls
royce.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
were
bought
over
the
objection
of
a
single
non-union
member,
and
it
was
a
rolls
royce?
you
say
he
should
lose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
wouldn't
he
at
least
have
the
same
argument
that
a
member
might
have
to
extravagant
use
of
union
funds
to
take
river
boat--
unknown
speaker
--so
he
would
be
a
fiduciary
in
the
same
sense
that
a
member
would
in
that
kind
of
challenge?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
acknowledge
that
a
non-member
would
have
a
cause
of
action
if
they
gave
money
to
a
political
party?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
they
have
precisely
the
same
cause
of
action
for
wasting
union
funds?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
may
i
interrupt?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
publications
of
the
union,
am
i
right
that
the
union
does
not
charge
for
the
contents
of
publications
that
relate
to
political
activities?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
brief
states
that.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
union
go
about
making
the
accounting
judgment
as
to
what
the
cost
of
political
activities
of--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
a
mechanical
process?
unknown
speaker
a
minor
question,
but
how
do
you
deal
with
advertisements,
just...
where
there
are
no
lines?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
let
me
ask
you
one...
do
you
think
there
is
a
rebate
issue
left
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
deduction,
yes.
unknown
speaker
probably
inexact.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
union
didn't...
assume
you
lose
on
these
items.
you
don't
object
independently
to
the
district
court's
way
of
solving
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gold,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
judgment
would
be
entered
in
favor
of
respondents.
now,
did
that
vacate
the
district
court
modification
of
the
rebate
plan?
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
merrill,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
do
you
now
contend
that
the
death
benefit
and
the
publications
are
administered
in
a
discriminatory
fashion?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
now
challenging
it?
i
mean,
you
say
maybe
you
should
have
challenged
it,
is
what
i
gather
you
are
saying.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
very
great
difference
between
an
issue
as
to
whether
death
benefits
can
be
charged
when
they
are
administered
in
a
non-discriminatory
neutral
fashion,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
an
employee
on
the
one
hand,
whereas
one
that
said
you
have
to
be
a
union
member
would
raise
quite
a
different
question.
unknown
speaker
even
if
neutral?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
neutral,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
exactly
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
hurt
the
individual
that
puts
the
money
up?
unknown
speaker
it
is
paying
for
his
political
beliefs,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
about
all
it
does?
unknown
speaker
and
that
hurts
him?
unknown
speaker
it
hurts
him--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
would
be
even
worse
if
they
had,
i
gather.
