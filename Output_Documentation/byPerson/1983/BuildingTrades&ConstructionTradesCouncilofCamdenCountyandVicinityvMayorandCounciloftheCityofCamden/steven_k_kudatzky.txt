mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
to
ask
this
court
of
nip
in
the
bud
a
trend
which
we
believe
is
pernicious
to
our
national
unity,
that
trend
being
an
attempt
by
the
city
of
camden,
among
other
cities,
to
solve
in
a
blunderbuss
fashion
the
problem
of
its
resident
unemployment
at
the
expense
of
non-residents
who
seek
the
opportunity
to
ply
their
trade,
pursue
their
common
calling,
whatever
the
court
cares
to
describe
it
as,
in
the
city
of
camden
without
being
discriminated
against
simply
because
they
are
non-residents
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
the
city
of
camden.
it
is
our
view
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
applies
to
protect
non-residents
against
this
sort
of
discrimination
and
that
under
the
applicable
tests
set
forth
by
this
court
for
privileges
and
immunities
issues,
set
forth
specifically
in
the
hicklin
v.
orbeck
case,
that
the
invalidation
of
the
camden
ordinance
should
follow.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
upholding
the
action
of
the
administrative
agency,
the
department
of
the
treasury
for
the
state
of
new
jersey,
which
approved
and
thereby
gave
life
to
the
camden
resident
preference
ordinance.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
held
essentially
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
did
not
vie
in
this
case
either
because
the
enactment
was
a
municipal
enactment
or,
more
accurately
in
my
view,
because
the
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
municipal
residence
is
not
a
right
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
we
believe
the
fact
that
this
was
enacted
by
the
city
of
camden
as
opposed
to
be
being
enacted
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
be
insignificant
and
that
the
real
question
is
does
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
municipal
residence
call
into
play
the
protection
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause?
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
in
our
view,
erred
factually
and
legally
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
the
court
felt
that
the
impact
of
this
ordinance
would
be
greater
with
respect
to
new
jersians
who
are
non-residents
of
camden
than
with
respect
to
non-residents
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
we
have
sought
to
demonstrate
through
census
data
that
we
have
included
in
our
reply
brief
that
within
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
of
philadelphia,
which
includes
the
city
of
camden,
certain
other
counties
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
and
certain
counties
outside
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
that
there
would
be
more
non-residents
who
are
likely
to
be
affected
by
this
ordinance
than
new
jersey
residents
who
are
non-residents
of
camden.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
fact
that
other
new
jersians
are
adversely
impacted
by
this
ordinance
either
renders
the
privileges
and
immunities
protection
inapplicable
or
somehow
serves
to
cure
the
harm
done
to
the
non-residents
by
putting
them
on
an
equal
footing
somehow
with
the
new
jersians.
we
believe
that
in
assessing
whether
non-residents
of
new
jersey
are
treated
the
same
as
resident
of
new
jersey,
that
all
residents
of
new
jersey
must
be
factored
into
the
equation
including
the
favored
class
here,
residents
of
the
city
of
camden.
some
new
jersey
residents
are
clearly
treated
better
than
residents
of
pennsylvania
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
the
fact
that
the
discrimination
is
on
the
basis
of
municipal
residence
does
not
render
the
privileges
and
immunities
protection
inapplicable.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
no,
justice.
clearly
persons
who
are
not
residents
of
the
city
of
camden
are
victimized
to
the
same
extent.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
wherever
they
live,
yes.
slightly
more
than
a
year
ago
this
court
heard
argument
in
the
case
of
white
versus
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
boston,
the
case
whose
facts
are
replicated
to
some
extent
in
this
case.
however,
we
believe
that
the
ruling
in
white
does
not
foreordain
the
rejection
of
our
arguments
here,
basically
for
the
reason
that
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
an
issue
reserved
for
decision
in
white;
namely
the
extent
to
which
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
might
afford
greater
protection
than
the
commerce
clause
which
was
at
issue
in
white.
we
believe
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
being
as
it
is
a
constitutional
guarantee
of
equality
of
treatment
to
non-residents
that
it
is
personal
to
the
individuals
involved,
is
not
something
that
congress
can
waive
or
authorize
a
violation
of
by
state.
we
do
have
udag
money
involved
in
this
case.
one
of
the
two
projects
to
which
the
ordinance
is
presently
being
applied
has
in
part
udag
money
funding
it
as
was
the
case
in
the
boston
situation.
we
also
have
here,
however,
money
from
the
department
of
transportation
funding
the
other
large
project
presently
being
subjected
to
the
ordinance,
a
transportation
center
for--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--the
city
of
philadelphia
versus
the
state
of
new
jersey?
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
justice,
that
is
certainly
not
our
case.
we
do
not--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--there
is
much
to
commend
the
view
basically
set
forth
in
the
court's
cases
on
tuition
preference
and
right
to
public
education.
a
city
or
a
state
might
have
the
right
to
prefer
its
own
residents
in
direct
distributions
of
state
resources
to
those
residents.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
such
as--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--correct.
the
court
has--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--well,
i
am
not
prepared
to
concede
that
today,
your
honor.
that
is
the
court
need
not--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--the
court
need
not
go
that
far.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
even
assuming
that
the
could
do
so
in-house,
as
you
are
positing,
i
don't
believe
that
would
answer
the
question
in
this
case
because
these
people
are
clearly
private
employees.
it
cannot
be
seriously
argued
in
my
view
that
these
employees
would
enjoy
or
not
enjoy
rather
the
protections
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
would
be
the
case
with
in-house
employees
of
the
city
if
they
were
doing
the
construction.
they
are
different.
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
respect
to
doing
the
work
in-house
and
the
application
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
the
first
instance
were
whether
that
would
survive
privileges
and
immunities
scrutiny
if
the
clause
applies
doesn't
apply
here.
it
is
not
this
case.
the
city
is
seeking
to
go
far
beyond
influencing
direct
distributions
of
its
own
resources
by
trying
to
regulate
private
employment.
and,
we
believe
that
is
a
distinction
of
constitutional
dimension
that
we
believe
sets
this
case
apart
from
boston
and
really
undercuts
the
analogy
in
the
white
case
of
these
employees
being
city
employees
in
an
informal
sense
as
justice
rehnquist
stated.
we
believe
that
the
right
being
asserted
here
is
a
right
which
has
traditionally
been
held
to
be
within
the
protection
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
that
in
light
of
that
fact
it
is
the
burden
of
the
city
to
come
forward
with
a
showing
that
the
non-residents
here
are
a
peculiar
source
of
the
evil
that
the
city
is
trying
to
deal
with
in
its
ordinance.
that
evil,
we
think,
is
a
broader
one
than
the
city's
characterization
of
it
in
its
brief.
it
is
simply
a
problem
of
high
unemployment
among
the
residents
of
camden.
it
is
not
necessarily
low
employment
of
camden
residents
on
camden
public
works
projects.
i
think
for
the
same
reasons
that
hicklin
v.
orbeck
invalidated
that
rationale
as
a
savings
rationale,
it
should
be
invalidated
here.
there
is
just
simply
no
showing
that
whatever
the
causes
of
the
unemployment
problems
in
camden
are
that
they
are
fairly
traceable
to
the
activities
of
non-residents.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
yes,
justice.
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
hicklin
court
did
not
really
address
the
propriety
of
the...
if
i
can
call
it
the
first-tier
regulation...
the
regulation
of
the
employees
who
were
working
directly
on
the
pipeline
as
opposed
to
those
further
down
the
line.
clearly
the
alaska
higher
statute
had
what
was
termed
the
ripple
effect
all
the
way
down
the
line.
the
city
of
camden
here
is
limiting
its
ordinance
in
a
very
precise
way
to
persons
who
are
going
to
be
employed
by
contractors
with
whom
the
city
deals
or
subcontractors
of
those
contractors
on
projects,
either
funded
directly
by
the
city
or
through
grants
administered
by
the
city,
which
need
not
and
are
not,
to
my
understanding,
limited
to
public
works
projects.
in
fact,
to
our
understanding,
with
the
nursing
home
project
presently
half
way
done,
i
would
say,
if
i
can
tell
by
looking
at
it
yesterday,
is
a
privately-owned
project
or
at
least
not
a
city-owned
project.
we
further
believe
that
the
city
has
attempted
really
to
use
a
shotgun
approach
to
a
problem
that
requires
a
surgically
precise
remedy.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
limit
the
benefits
of
the
ordinance
to
unemployed
persons,
to
persons
of
a
certain
economic
level,
or
to
persons
who
are
qualified
to
work
in
the
construction
trades.
we
also
do
not
believe
that
the
city
has
asserted
justification
that
this
also
promotes
minority
hiring
is
enough
to
say
the
ordinance--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--the
ordinance
does
not
affirmatively
say
qualifications
are
irrelevant.
i
would
assume
that
that
would
come
in
when
the
city
was
trying
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
good
faith
compliance
was
attempted
by
the
contractor.
the
contractor
would
come
in
and
say
that
i
didn't
hire
this
resident
because
he
was
unqualified,
therefore,
i
took
a
non-residents
who
happened
to
be
more
qualified.
that
may
or
may
not
constitute
sufficient
good
faith
effort.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
we
can't
say
that
at
this
point.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
invalidation
of
the
camden
ordinance
would
necessarily
call
into
question
the
continued
validity
of
mccarthy
versus
the
city
of
philadelphia
that
public
employment
itself
may
be
limited
to
residents.
the
court
need
not
go
that
far
as
i
have
indicated
and
in
our
view
the
implications
of
this
ruling
are
only
with
respect
to
attempts
by
governmental
bodies
to
influence
the
decisions
of
private
employers
and
further
down
the
line
employers...
i
am
sorry...
subcontractors
of
private
employers.
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
will
sound
the
death
knell
of
various
attempts
by
states
to
limit
access
to
state
resources
whether
directly
or
indirectly
to
their
own
residents.
if
i
may
return
to
my
discussion
of
why
this
case
is
not
the
same
as
white,
i
mentioned
this
transportation
center
that
is
involved
in
this
case
as
being
funded
by
department
of
transportation
money
under
the
urban
mass
transit
act.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
interpretation
of
the
secretary
of
transportation
that
resident
preferences
in
the
projects
funded
by
such
monies
are
impermissible.
so,
we
do
not
have
the
harmony
of...
the
harmony
with
the
congressional
goals
that--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
the
court
never
quite
frankly
addressed
the
issue
at
that
level.
they
stopped
once
they
determined
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--no,
your
honor,
we
have
only
recently
been
able
to
determine
who
is
funding
what
projects.
at
the
time
this
case
was
argued
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
the
transportation
center
was,
i
think,
very
much
at
a
conceptual
stage
or
at
least
on
the
drawing
board.
the
absence
of
that
harmony,
i
think,
undercuts
some
of
the
white
reasoning
for
upholding
the
resident
preference
there.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
has
at
best
spoken
with
a
mixed
voice
as
to
resident
preferences.
the
constitutional
guarantee
involved
here
applies
more
specifically
to
the
individual
employees.
white
did
not
really
deal
with
the
rights
of
individual
employees.
it
seemed
to
deal
more
with
the
rights
of
the
contractors
under
the
commerce
clause,
although
certain
union
groups
were
parties
plaintiff
in
that
case.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
yes,
that
is
precisely
my
point,
justice.
with
respect
to
those
projects
which
are
funded
in
part
by
federal
monies,
any
inference
that
congress
has
approved
resident
preference,
i
think,
is
unavailable
in
this
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
congress
is
not
authorized
to
waive
privileges
and
immunities
protections.
we
do
not
wish
to
be
construed
to
be
attacking
the
laudable
goals
of
the
camden
ordinance.
camden
clearly
is
a
city
with
a
lot
of
problems.
we
just
believe
that
their
goals
could
be
accomplished
with
less
violence
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
other
ways
such
as
by
preferring
its
residents
for
job
training
programs,
by
doing
some
of
the
work
in-house
if
they
really
felt
that
that
was
necessary.
the
city,
to
my
knowledge,
has
not
traditionally,
as
most
governmental
entities
have
not,
to
my
understanding,
built
their
own
public
works
with
their
own
work
force,
but
it
is
a
method
that
might
be
available
to
them
and
would
present
certainly
different
issues
than
are
presented
in
this
challenge.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
yes,
justice.
we
find
little
to
distinguish
this
case
from
hicklin,
although
it
is
clearly--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--yes.
we
believe
the
court
read
hicklin
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
general
in
a
very
miserly
fashion
in
that
respect.
pennsylvanians
do
not
have
access
to
new
jersey
political
processes
that
other
persons
in
new
jersey
would
have
access
to.
justice
marshall,
in
the
austin
case,
noted
the
importance
of
the
political
accountability
rationale
in
dealing
with
privileges
and
immunities
questions.
the
fact
that
new
jersians
might,
if
this
court
agrees
with
me,
be
in
a
worse
position
than
pennsylvanians
is
not
something
that
i
really
stop
this
court
from
taking
that
step.
new
jersians
have
the
right
to
petition
the
new
jersey
legislature
to
revoke
camden's
power
to
have
such
an
ordinance.
and,
specifically
we
believe
that
more
non-residents,
given
the
location
of
camden,
two
miles
from
the
center
of
philadelphia,
the
fourth
largest
city
in
the
country,
are
going
to
be
adversely
impacted.
the
new
jersey
court
seemed
to
take
into
account
the
entire
population
of
new
jersey
which,
i
suppose,
would
fall
within
pretty
much
a
100-mile
radius
of
camden.
even
within
the
100-miles
radius,
you
would
pick
up
new
york
city,
baltimore,
all
those
areas.
there
would
still
be,
in
my
view,
more
non-residents,
although
i
don't
have
the
statistics
to
demonstrate
that
with
respect
to
who
is
actually
within
a
100-mile
radius
of
camden.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
justice
powell,
with
respect
to
that
very
point,
the
city
of
philadelphia
has
suffered
many
of
those
same
problems
over
the
last
decade.
there
is
no
evidence
and
no
basis
for
assuming
that
philadelphians
or
pennsylvanians
or
delawarians
have
caused
any
of
these
problems
to
be
suffered
by
camden.
i
would
also
like
to
concur
with,
i
believe,
justice
stevens'
observation
that
this
case
must
be
analyzed
as
if
it
were
100
percent
preference
here,
because
clearly,
i
believe,
that
if
the
city
can
do
40
percent,
they
can
require
100
percent
preference
and
that
the
case
should
be
analyzed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
no,
justice,
i
do
not.
we
started
this
case
as
early
as
we
could.
we
didn't
want
to
wait
and
file
a
1983
action
after
people
had
actually
lost
jobs.
the
ordinance
came
into
effect
upon
its
approval
by
the
state
affirmative
action
officer.
under
new
jersey
law,
the
exclusive
method
of
reviewing
state
administrative
agency
action
is
by
appeal
to
the
appellate
division.
at
that
point,
once
the
ordinance
came
into
play,
non-residents,
out-of-state
residents,
seeking
to
work
on
construction
projects
were
the
victims
of
a
diminution
in
their
job
market,
that
diminution
being
40
percent
of
the
component
of
that
job
market
represented
by
city
of
camden
public
works
projects,
which
is
not
an
insubstantial
amount.
while
i
cannot
name
an
individual
who
has
suffered
the
loss
of
a
job
at
this
point,
it
seems
undeniable
to
me
that
some
day
someone
is
going
to
actually
lose
a
job,
but
presently
people
are
having
a
diminution.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
pardon
me?
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
well,
we
didn't
think
that
it
was
necessary
or
appropriate
to
wait
that
long.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
i
will
agree
that
no
specific
individual
has
done
that.
we
do
assert,
nevertheless,
the
standing
does
exist
because
these
persons
are
likely
to
suffer
the
detriment.
that
detriment
is
traceable
to
the
ordinance
and,
in
fact,
they
are
presently
suffering
a
detriment
in
the
reduction
of
their
employability
represented
by
the
resident
preference.
i
would
again
note
that
we
are
representing
or
asserting
rather
the
rights
of
out-of-state
employees.
we
are
not
here
defending
the
contractors.
it
is
irrelevant
in
my
view
what
penalties
or
non-penalties
might
exist
for
contractors.
in
this
case,
even
if
one
out-of-state
resident
loses
a
job
or
an
employment
opportunity,
i
think
that
is
sufficient
to
confer
standing
and
to
create
a
privileges
and
immunities
controversy
cognizable
by
this
court.
with
respect
to
the
point
that
we
are
asserting
a
right
to
work
on
camden
public
works
projects,
i
disagree
that
the
right
being
asserted
is
so
specific.
in
hicklin
v.
orbeck
people
could
have
work
on
non-oil
and
gas
related
jobs
in
alaska,
yet
the
fact
that
those
jobs
were
denied
them
was
deemed
sufficient
to
trigger
the
applicability
of
the
clause.
in
toomer,
the
shrimp
people
could
have
gone
and
fished
for
something
besides
shrimp
or
fished
beyond
the
three-mile
limit,
yet
that
constriction
of
their
employability
was
sufficient.
we
see
a
trend
already
under
way
in
new
jersey
where
two
other
jurisdictions
have
enacted
protectionist
preference
ordinances
perhaps
as
a
result
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
ruling
here.
i
think
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
would
be
gutted,
literally
gutted
if
it
is
not
applicable
to
municipal
residents'
discrimination.
it
would
be
no
different
than
allowing
the
state
to
accomplish
via
the
backdoor
what
it
cannot
accomplish
directly.
in
state
of
new
jersey
versus
city
of
philadelphia,
new
jersey
could
vend
philadelphia's
trash
on
a
county-by-county
or
municipality-by-municipality
basis.
if
it
could
do
that,
but
couldn't
do
it
directly,
this
court's
ruling
would
have
been
eviscerated.
we
see
a
day
coming
when
people
will
only
be
able
to
work
where
they
live.
philadelphia
surely
has
cause
now
to
enact
a
retaliatory
resident
preference
ordinance
and
a
number
of
camden
residents
would
be
penalized
by
that
certainly.
other
municipalities
in
new
jersey
have
reason
to
do
that.
1984
is
coming.
we
would
not
like
to
see
this
court
encourage
in
any
way
a
system
which
could
lead
ultimately
to
an
internal
passport
system
where
people--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--correct.
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
well,
the
public--
mr.
steven
k.
kudatzky
--yes.
that,
nevertheless,
in
the
building
and
construction
trades
these
days
is
virtually
the
entire
field.
there
is
little...
certainly
in
camden,
there
is
little
going
on
that
is
not
public-works
related
in
the
broadest
sense.
with
respect
to
the
divided
loyalty
question,
clearly
some
members
of
our
unions
are
camden
residents
and
are
being
benefited,
however,
they,
i
believe,
would
rather
see
this
type
of
protectionism
struck
down
because
they
know
that
they
are
going
to
be
the
victims
when
it
is
philadelphia
or
another
camden
suburb
that
enacts
the
ordinance.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
this
is
going
to
stop
at
camden's
door.
there
are
521
municipalities
in
new
jersey.
all
of
them
could
do
the
same
thing
and
certainly
a
vast
number
more
throughout
the
country.
the
goal
of
revitalization
cited
by
the
city
simply
is
not
well
served
by
pitting
camden
against
its
neighbors,
particularly
its
out-of-state
neighbors
in
this
respect.
we
believe
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
applies
here
and
limits
the
rights
of
the
city
in
preferring
its
own
residents
or
trying
to
ensure
to
them
the
benefits
of
some
of
its
expenditures
when
they
try
to
do
it
this
way.
regulation
of
private
employment
is
simply
beyond
any
concept
validated
by
this
court
of
state
or
municipal
sovereignty.
there
are
differences.
they
are
doing
it
in
a
constitutionally
impermissible
fashion
in
this
case.
it
is
not
to
say
that
they
cannot
do
it
in
some
other
fashion
and
accomplish
substantially
a
similar
result.
i
have
nothing
further.
