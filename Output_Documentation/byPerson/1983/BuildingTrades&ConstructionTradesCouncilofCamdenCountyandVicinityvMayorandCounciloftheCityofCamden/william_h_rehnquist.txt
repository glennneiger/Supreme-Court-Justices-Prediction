justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
city
of
camden,
new
jersey,
a
couple
of
years
ago
passed
a
law
requiring
that
at
least
40%
of
the
employees
of
contractors
and
subcontractors
who
work
on
construction
projects
that
were
funded
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
city
money
be
residents
of
the
city
of
camden.
the
stated
purpose
of
the
law
was
to
counteract
widespread
unemployment
in
urban
decay
in
the
city
of
camden.
an
association
of
labor
organizations
representing
employees
in
the
building
and
construction
trades
who
live
outside
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
challenged
camden's
resident
hiring
preferences
as
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
united
states
constitution.
that
section
which
is
an
article
iv
provides
that
the
citizens
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
citizens
in
the
several
states.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
rejected
this
challenge
on
the
grounds
that
since
new
jersey
citizens
living
outside
camden
are
as
much
affected
by
the
law
is
the
citizens
of
other
states.
therefore,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
didn't
apply
to
the
camden
ordinance.
we
conclude
that
camden's
ordinance
is
not
immune
from
examination
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
at
the
behest
of
out-of-state
residents
merely
because
some
in-state
residents
are
similarly
disadvantaged.
to
read
into
the
clause
of
blanket
exemption
for
all
classifications
that
are
less
than
statewide
would
provide
states
with
two
simple
means
for
evading
its
strictures.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
on
remand,
the
city
of
camden
will
have
an
opportunity
to
prevent
evidence
and
support
of
its
ordinance
under
the
traditional
constitutional
standard.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
