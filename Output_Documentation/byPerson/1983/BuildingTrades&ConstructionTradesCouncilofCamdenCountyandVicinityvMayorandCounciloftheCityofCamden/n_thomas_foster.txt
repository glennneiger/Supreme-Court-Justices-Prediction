mr.
n.
thomas
foster
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
camden
here,
of
course,
takes
quite
a
different
position
than
appellants
in
this
matter
and
asks
that
this
court,
if
it
would,
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and,
in
the
alternative,
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
based
on
what
we
think
are
three
very
critical
and
important
premises.
first,
that
this
case
before
the
court
is
not
ripe
for
decision
because
appellants
have
established
no
case
of
controversy.
secondly,
because
the
camden
ordinance
provides
a
basis
for
good
or
best-faith
effort
to
provide
hiring
preference
for
40
percent
of
those
persons
employed
on
construction
projects
for
camden
residents
does
not
violate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and,
of
course,
the
equal
protection
question
raised
by
the
duration
residency
clause
has
been
mooted
by
amendment
and
revision
of
our
ordinance.
we
noted,
your
honors,
with
a
great
deal
of
interest,
that
the
appellants
here
have
not
established
any
injury
either
to
themselves
or
any
member
of
their
unions.
there
is
no
record
of
any
injury,
there
is
no
record
of
any
person
being
denied
a
job,
there
is
no
record
of
any
individual
outside
the
state
of
new
jersey
being
denied
employment
because
of
the
ordinance
here
that
the
city
of
camden
has
established.
there
are
no
concrete
facts
for
this
court
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
if
not
an
actual
privileges
and
immunities
issues
has
been
raised
by
the
appellant.
we
have
no
factual
backdrop
to
determine
how
many
persons,
if
any
persons,
have
been
injured
by
this
ordinance
passed
by
the
city
of
camden.
we
think
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
has
been
no
factual
backdrop
or
no
clear
definition
of
a
concise
injury
or
concrete
establishment
of
a
fact
of
injury
is
because
appellants
here
clearly
misapply
and
misunderstand,
in
our
opinion,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
itself
is
a
clause
historically
which
is
established
to
develop
national
unity,
a
national
republic,
out
of
a
number
of
independent
sovereign
states
at
the
beginning
of
this
country's
history.
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
form
a
comity
of
interests
among
the
states,
among
the
citizens
of
those
states,
assuring
to
the
citizens
of
each
state
the
same
fundamental
rights
and
privileges
of
citizens
of
other
states.
nowhere
in
the
case
law,
nowhere
in
the
constitution
does
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
itself
deny
states
their
own
sovereignty,
the
sovereignty
to
solve
their
own
problems,
the
sovereignty
to
solve
their
own
local
social
ills.
nowhere
does
the
constitution--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--no,
we
don't
say
that.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
all
right.
we
could
say
that,
your
honor.
we
don't
say
that,
however,
is
what
i
mean.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
well,
yes,
because
of
hicklin,
but
because
of
the
far
reaching
impact
of
the
ripple
effect,
of
course,
that
hicklin
has
established.
we
feel
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
does
not
deny
a
state
or
local
government
from
solving
its
own
problems.
we
don't
feel
as
though
it
says
that
at
all.
it
does
not
say
that
in
fact.
in
fact,
as
we
look
at
a
number
of
cases...
this
court
has
stated
in
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
v.
mississippi
that
the
idea
of
states
solving
their
own
local
ills
is
no
judicial
myth.
states,
in
fact,
promote
the
idea
of
states
as
laboratories
to
solve
their
own
local
problems.
here
the
city
of
camden,
a
city
with
severe
labor,
economic,
and
social
problems
is
attempting
to
do
that
very...
to
achieve
that
very
goal,
solving
its
own
local
problems.
the
city,
which,
by
the
way,
has
an
unemployment
rate
of
over
20
percent,
over
twice
that
of
the
national
record,
and,
of
course,
as
counsel
stated
something
to
the
effect
that
it
would
be
a
blunderbuss
fashion
to
solve
a
social
ill.
this
is
no
blunderbuss
fashion
to
solve
a
social
ill.
it
is
the
attempt
by
the
city
of
camden
to
ameliorate
serious
social
problems
facing
its
unemployed
persons.
we
feel
in
no
way
this
ordinance
would
simply
ask
that
a
contractor
who
comes
into
camden
to
work
on
public
works
projects
in
the
cost
range
of
over
$50,000
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
provide
employment
for...
in
terms
of
its
hiring
practice
hire
40
percent
citizens
of
the
city
of
camden.
i
think
it
is
important
also
for
us
to
stress
at
this
point
that
there
are
no
penalties
for
a
contractor
who
fails
to
reach
the
40
percent.
in
fact,
there
is
a
very
good
possibility
the
40
percent
could
be
all
members
of
this
union
here
or--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--yes,
sir.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
your
honor,
it
was...
it
worked
its
way
into
the
new
jersey
court
system
in
a
very
interesting
fashion.
according
to
new
jersey
statute
in
terms
of
anti-discrimination
law,
the
state
department
of
the
treasury,
its
affirmative
action
ordinance,
has
the
right
to
endorse
any
local
plan.
we
call
this,
in
effect,
the
camden
plan.
the
camden
city
council
adopted
this
ordinance
and
it
became
effective
once
it
was
approved
by
the
state
affirmative
action
officer.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
at
that
point
in
time,
once
this
case
was
approved
by
the
department
of
the
treasury
or
the
state
affirmative
action
officer,
the
appellants
here
then
took
the
case
directly,
following
an
administrative
decision...
it
was
an
administrative
decision...
into
the
new
jersey
appellate
division,
superior
court
appellant
division.
that
is
under
rule
256
of
new
jersey
court
rules
which
says
that
a
party
may
at
any
time,
if
it
opposes
or
feels
aggrieved
by
an
administrative
ruling,
the
state
may
go
directly
into
the
appellate
division.
and,
this
is
what
the
appellants
here
elected
to
do.
that
is
why
there
was
no
concrete
record
below.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly...
the
ordinance
had
just
been
approved
by
the
state
treasurer.
immediately
they
appealed
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
jersey
superior
court.
we
feel,
your
honors,
that
this
case
in
no
way
threatens
any
person
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
because
it
places
persons
within
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
same
precise
predicament
and
posture
as
persons
outside
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes,
sir.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
certified
directly.
in
other
words,
it
was
never
heard
by
the
appellate
division,
your
honor.
it
went
directly
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
one
of
the
points
we
try
to
make
on
this
case
is
that
no
one
is...
no
state
citizens
of
new
jersey
is
advantaged
or
given
an
advantage
because
of
state
citizenship
and
no
out-of-state
citizen
is
denied
an
advantage
because
of
out-of-state
residency
in
this
particular
ordinance.
there
is
no
benefit
to
being
a
new
jersey
resident
just
as
there
is
no
disadvantage
to
being
an
out-of-state
resident.
therefore,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
matter
falls
under
ambit
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
as
traditionally
has
been
argued.
we
feel
that
in
terms
of
the
hicklin
case,
which
was
argued
by
the
appellants,
that
there
is
a
different
case
altogether.
there
are
similarities
however,
we
feel
that
the
hicklin
case
goes
much
further
than
the
camden
ordinance
in
terms
of
its
ripple
effect.
if
we
look
at
the
hicklin
case,
we
can
see
where
the
advantages
of
the
alaskan
hire
law
even
went
to
suppliers
of
subcontractors
and
it
was
very
difficult,
as
this
court
has
stated
for
the
court
to
even
determine
how
remote
or
how
the
attenuating
factors
involved
in
this
case
affected
or
achieved
the
goals
that
were
to
be
affected
by
this
hire
law.
our
particular
ordinance
is
specific,
it
is
to
the
point,
and
applies
only
to
persons
working
on
public
works
projects
for
the
city
of
camden.
another
point
that
i
think
is
important
in
terms
of
privileges
and
immunities
argument
is
that
no
person
is
denied
any
fundamental
right
here.
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
work
on
a
construction
project
for
the
city
of
camden.
and,
when
we
weigh
that
particular
factor
with
the
interest
the
city
has
or
the
state
has
in
developing
its
urban
infrastructure
or
the
development
of
those
citizens
within
our
city,
we
feel
that
weighing
the
fundamental
right
alleged
here
and
the
interest
of
the
state
far
outweigh
the
particular
argument
being
made
by
counsel.
what
we
also
want
to
impress
upon
this
court,
that
the
city
of
camden,
like
so
many
other
cities
in
the
northeastern
part
of
our
country
and
throughout
this
country,
as
they
become
older,
find
that
one
of
the
remaining
resources
available
to
those
cities
is
the
rehabilitation,
revitalization,
remodernization
of
the
city's
infrastructure.
we
feel
that
the
development
of
a
city
for
those
persons
who
continue
to
live
there,
for
those
new
industries
or
services
who
wish
to
move
there,
redevelopment
of
highways,
facilities
such
a
bridges,
sewers,
whatever,
is
a
new
resource
and
new
industry
facing
our
cities,
the
redevelopment
of
our
transportation
systems.
and,
we
feel
that
the
city
of
camden,
as
well
as
the
state
of
new
jersey,
has
an
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
its
citizens
benefit
directly
from
the
need
to
rehabilitate
and
revitalize
the
infrastructure
of
our
cities.
the
important
factor
here
again
is
that
the
city
of
camden
is
not
here
attempting
to
develop
some
sort
of
obstructionist
goal
or
doctrine
of
trying
to
keep
people
out.
in
fact,
we
welcome
people
to
come
into
the
city
of
camden.
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
pass
affirmative
social
legislation
to
benefit
the
citizens
of
our
city
and
we
do
not
in
any
way
violate
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
doing
so.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
well,
we...
i
can't
say,
your
honor,
that
we
don't
want
that.
we
don't
want
that
if
it
is,
in
effect,
going
to
take
jobs
away
from
camden
citizens
certainly.
if
we
are
talking
about,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
factor
here,
where
construction
companies,
using
your
example,
are
hiring
people
from
philadelphia
while
camden
people
go
unemployed,
then,
of
course,
yes,
i
agree
exactly
with
what
you
are
saying.
i
think
the
point
is
very
interesting
here
about
unions'
posture
in
this
entire
case.
we
see
several
things
here.
number
one,
the
unions
obviously
must
have
some
people
who
belong
to
it
who
benefit
from
our
ordinance.
keep
in
mind
that
our
ordinance
says
make
a
best-faith
effort
to
hire
40
percent
residents
in
terms
of
manpower.
obviously,
it
would
seem
to
me,
that
a
union
that
would
come
into
camden
or
a
construction
company
that
would
come
into
camden
to
work
would
normally,
ordinarily
hire
persons
who
worked
in
the
city
of
camden.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
well,
your
honor,
it
does
in
terms,
we
feel,
in
position
of
standing.
we
find
that
the
union
is
somewhat
in
conflict
if
it
has
members
of
its
union
who,
for
instance,
are
benefiting
from
the
preference
clause
or...
as
well
as
those
they
say
who
don't
benefit
or
are
injured
by
it.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
no.
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
i
think
in
addressing
the
chief
justice's
question
as
i
recall
it
is
that
the
posture
we
are
taking
is
that
the
standing
issue
is
one
that
has
to
be
addressed.
it
is
one
that
we
feel
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
posture
of
the
unions
in
this
case.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
we
see
no
difficulty
with
that
at
all.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
your
honor,
i
didn't--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--no,
i
would
disagree
with
your
honor.
that
was
a
point
that
the
appellants
make
here
about
what
they
call
economic
vulcanization
or
parochial
interest.
we
feel
that
in
terms
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
argument
that
if
a
state...
i
don't
think
any
state
or
any
city
can
just
simply
make
a
rule
saying
that
you
must
hire
our
own
and
keep
out
other
people
and
that
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
hard
here
to
impress
upon
the
court.
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities.
however,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
has
certain
principles.
one,
of
course,
as
long
as
the
discrimination
is
not
based
upon
alienage
or
based
upon
residency,
that,
of
course--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--well,
no,
it
is
not
based
on
residency,
your
honor,
because
this
is
not
an
ordinance
that
simply
says
that
out-of-state
residents
or--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--yes,
but
that
is
not,
your
honor,
a
privileges
and
immunities
argument.
we
don't
take
that
position.
this
is
based
on
municipal
residency,
not
state
residency.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
we
are
providing
a
preference
for
certain
residents,
those
are
residents
of
the
city
of
camden.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
fact
this
is
our
case
in
terms
of
the
facts
established
because
the
state
of
new
jersey--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--your
honor,
i
don't
see
that
as
being
in
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
no,
i
don't.
i
do
take
that
position,
yes.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
i
would
like
to
say
this
case
is
not
here,
but
i
am
not
clear,
your
honor,
if
the
case
would
fail
for
that
reason.
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
was
very
important
in
the
hicklin
case,
and
even
in
the
case
of
toomer
against
witsell,
was
that
those
cases
indicated
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
not
an
absolute;
that
there
can
be
distinction
made
between
citizens
and
non-citizens
and
one
of
the
factors
was
whether
or
not
a
state
had
a
possessory
interest
in
any
of
the
factors
concerned
such
as
its
own
resources,
money,
or
whatever.
there
is
another
factor
that
i
would
like
to
argue
here.
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
the
white
case,
white
against
massachusetts
council
of
construction
employers.
that
case,
of
course,
was
founded
on
the
commerce
clause,
found
that
that
case
did
not
violate
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
it
is
important
for
us
to
point
out
that
we
feel
that
the
commerce
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
are
mutually
reinforcing
doctrines,
each
attempting
in
its
own
way
to
establish
a
certain
sense
of
national
unity;
one
vis
a
vis
the
flow
of
commerce,
the
other
through
the
flow
of
persons
and
privileges
and
fundamental
rights
of
citizens
through
the
states.
we
feel
that
there
are
times,
for
instance,
when
a
state
does
get
involved
in
commerce,
as
long
as
it
is
acting
as
a
market
participant
rather
than
a
market
regulator,
that
it
may
get
involved
in
commerce
and
somehow
involve
itself
in
the
flow
of
commerce.
as
long
as
the
state
is
using
its
own
money
and
it
may
distinguish
and
favor
citizens
of
that
state
which
was
certainly
the
case
in
this
court's
opinion
in
hughes
v.
alexandria
scrap,
reeves
and
stake.
i
think
the
same
thing
can
be
said
true
about
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
that
there
are
times
when
the
state...
when
it
can
in
the
protection
of
certain
vital
state
interests
find
that
it
can
and
should
favor
or
distinguish
or
make
distinction
between
its
own
citizens
and
other
citizens.
i
don't
feel
that
when
those
vital
interests
are...
when
those
particular
factors
are
prevalent
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
any
particular
individual.
we
also
find
it
interesting
that
here
a
council
of
trade
unions,
who
probably
feel
that
a
clause
in
a
contract
that
says
buy
american
is
patriotic,
but
on
the
other
hand,
a
clause
in
a
contract
that
says
hire
local
is
unconstitutional.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
statute
here
or
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
camden,
which
attempts
to
ameliorate
certain
local
evils,
addresses
specifically
those
evils,
and
simply
requests
of
those
contractors
who
do
business
with
it
to
try
to
hire
our
own.
in
the
appellant's
brief,
they
speak
in
strong
terms
of
our
ordinance
being
exclusionary,
denying
access
to
out-of-state
persons.
the
concern
that
we
have
here
is
that
that
is
not
true
and
if
one
reads
that
ordinance
carefully
you
can
see
that
it
excludes
no
one
and
denies
no
one
access
and
impinges
upon
no
one's
constitutional
right.
it
is
merely
an
effort
by
the
city
of
camden
to
address
a
very
grave
social
issue
by
passing
what
it
thinks
is
an
affirmative,
positive,
social
legislation
to
cure
a
local
ill.
and,
we
feel
that
we
should
pass
reference
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
because
we
do
not
feel
as
though
it
reaches
that
level.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--yes.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
rely
on
that.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
that
is
true.
that
is
our
point,
your
honor.
it
is
not...
i
thought
we
had
addressed
that
to
one
of
your
colleagues.
that
it
is
not
municipal...
because
it
is
municipal
residency
rather
than
state
residency--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--your
honor,
we
feel
two
ways
about
that.
number
one,
we
don't
think
it
will
happen.
if
it
did,
we
don't
see
anything...
we
don't
see
that
violating
privileges
and
immunities
constitution,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes.
we
would
concede
that
if
that
were
to
happen,
then
the
state
of
new
jersey...
and
if
the
ill
effects
attained,
then
we
think
the
state
of
new
jersey
then
would
have
an
obligation
to--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--well,
your
honor,
that
is
the
position
the
appellants
take,
because
the
state
of
new
jersey
has...
this
department
of
treasury
has
sanctioned
or
approved
our
ordinance,
that
it
is
state
action.
our
position
is
that
it
is
really
a
municipal
ordinance
created
by
the
city
of
camden
to
cure
local
evils
within
the--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--yes.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
that
is
correct.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes.
apparently
i
answered
that
question
differently.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
your
honor--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--i
don't
see
any
difficulty
with
that
under
the
constitution.
i
think
that--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--well,
i
would
assume
that
could
be
true,
your
honor.
i
think
the
thing
we
have
to
look
at
is
what
are
we
asking
or
what
are
we
trying
to
legislate?
remember,
that
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
camden
states
very
specifically
that
for
any
contractor
who
performs
public
works
projects
for
the
city
of
camden,
paid
by
the
city
of
camden,
either
in
whole
or
in
part
or
through
funds
administered
by
the
city
of
camden,
attempt
to
hire
40
percent...
attempt
to
hire
in
his
work
force
40
percent
residents
of
the
city
of
camden.
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
working
on
a
public
works
project
in
the
city
of
camden.
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
work
in
a
public
works
project
in
trenton,
cherry
hill,
elizabeth,
jersey
city,
or
newark.
so,
i
would
say
that
in
terms
of
that
there
would
be
no
fundamental
rights
involved.
of
course,
as
stated
earlier,
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
mccarthy
v.
philadelphia,
detroit
association
against
detroit,
it
has
been
determined
that
even
the
right
to
direct
employment
with
a
municipality
is
not
a
constitutional
right
or
fundamental
right.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
--yes.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
yes,
your
honor,
tremendously.
in
1970,
the
population
of
the
city
of
camden,
i
believe,
was
approximately
103,000
persons.
in
1980,
it
had
dropped
to
85,000.
mr.
n.
thomas
foster
your
honor,
approximately
34
percent
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
camden
is
receiving
some
type
of
social
relief,
welfare
assistance.
it
represents
approximately
one-third
of
our
population.
camden
is
also
a
community
which
is
approximately
75
percent
minority
and,
of
course,
our
unemployment
rate
is
approximately
20
percent,
twice
that
of
the
nation,
and
some
five
or
six
percent
higher
than
the
state
of
new
jersey.
