unknown
speaker
but
the
discrimination
is
not
limited
to
non-residents,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
wherever
they
live?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kudatzky,
suppose
the
city
was,
with
its
own
employees,
doing
a
lot
of
its
own
construction
work,
but
required
that
anybody
who
worked
on
those
jobs
be
residents
of
the
city.
would
you
still
be
here
or
would
you
think
the
philadelphia
case
covered
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
isn't.
but,
i
just
wondered
if
you
had
a
view
about
it.
unknown
speaker
such
as--
unknown
speaker
--such
as
limiting
its
employees
to
residents
of
the
state
or
the
city?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
survive
the
privileges
and
immunities
challenge
as
well
as
the
commerce
challenge?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
were?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but,
what
if
we
were?
what
if
we
thought
that
camden
could
easily
have
withstood
any
kind
of
a
constitutional
attack
if
it
simply
provided
that
its
own
employees
had
to
be
city
residents
and
they
did
all
their
construction
work
with
city
employees?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kudatzky,
the
alaska
statute
in
hicklin
had
a
good
deal
broader
sweep
than
the
camden
ordinance
here,
didn't
it?
i
don't
just
mean
geographically,
but
didn't
they
try
to
regulate
virtually
all
private
employment
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
would
the
camden
ordinance
require
a
contractor
to
employ
someone
that
he
regarded
as
unqualified
to
be,
say,
a
bricklayer
or
some
other
part
of
the
trade,
in
order
to
make
up
the
40
percent
rather
than
pick
someone
who
he
did
regard
as
qualified
who
is
not
a
resident
of
the
city
of
camden?
unknown
speaker
we
really
can't
say
at
this
point
the
camden
ordinance
would
forbid
choice
of
a
non-resident
on
the
basis
of
qualification
even
though
the
40
percent
goal
weren't
met?
unknown
speaker
was
that
point
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
mean
was
it
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
was
it
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
by
you?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
congress
might
take
this
thing
out
of
the
commerce
clause
challenge,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
can
forgive
a
privileges
and
immunities
violation.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say,
mr.
kudatzky,
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
that
your
reliance
is
primarily
on
hicklin?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
notice
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court...
i
gather
this
is
the
bottom
line,
isn't
it,
because
the
camden
ordinance
does
not
affect
"the
states'
treatment
of
each
other's
residents.
"
citing
hicklin.
it
does
not
violate
any
privilege.
that
you
think
is
error.
unknown
speaker
would
you
suggest
that
camden
could
pass
an
ordinance
that
said
that
every
contractor
performing
any
construction
work
in
the
city,
whether
for
the
city
or
privately,
must
employ
40
percent
camden
residents?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
why
wouldn't
you?
why
shouldn't
the
city
have
the
authority
to
solve
its
own
problems?
unknown
speaker
because
of
hicklin?
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster?
unknown
speaker
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
there
was
no
concrete
case
of
controversy
here.
i
was
just
looking
over
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
on
page
a2
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
and
the
only
sense
i
could
find
in
there
was
appellant
united
building
and
construction
trades
council,
an
association
of
labor
organizations,
challenges
state
approval
of
the
camden
program
as
both
unauthorized
under
new
jersey
law
and
unconstitutional.
how
did
this
case
work
its
way
into
the
new
jersey
court
system?
unknown
speaker
it
could
not
have
become
effective
without
that?
unknown
speaker
this
was
really
at
the
formative
stage
of
the
camden
ordinance.
it
was
just
getting
off
the
ground.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
foster.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
appellate
division
did
not...
there
was
no
decision
there.
the
supreme--
unknown
speaker
--court
certified--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
what
you
don't
want
to
happen
is
to
have
people
cross
the
delaware
river
from
pennsylvania
and
come
to
work
in
camden
by
day
and
go
back
to
their
pennsylvania
homes
by
night.
that
you
have
prohibited
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
the
union
members
are
benefited
or
not
to
the
issues
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
last
year
we
had
a
case
where
i
think
the
league
of
women
voters
in
wyoming
was
challenging
the
apportionment
of
one
particular
county.
now,
you
wouldn't
throw
the
league
of
women
voters
out
because
they
had
a
member
who
lived
in
that
county
and
might
benefit?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
would
your
argument
be
different,
instead
of
40
percent
it
were
100
percent?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
agree,
of
course,
then
that
philadelphia
could
have
imposed
the
same
kind
of
requirement
on--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
be
better
if
each
city
preferred
its
own
citizens
rather
than
let
anybody
cross
the
river.
unknown
speaker
i
can
see
that
this
sort
of
ordinance
cuts
both
ways
for
people
in
camden
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
but
here
it
is
based
on
residency.
unknown
speaker
residency
in
the
city.
you
have
got
to
be
a
resident
of
camden
to
get
to
be
one
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
if
you
are...
you
say
you
have
to
be
a
camden
resident,
but
if
you
are
a
camden
resident,
you
are
a
resident
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
preferring
certain
state
residents,
certain
residents
of
new
jersey
to
non-residents
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
foster,
do
you
suggest
this
case
would
be
some
how
different
if
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
enacted
a
state-wide
law
saying
that
camden
shall
grant
40
percent
preference
to
its
local
residents?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
way
too.
i
gather
from
one
of
your
comments
in
response
to
one
of
my
colleagues
that
where
perhaps
the
state
of
new
jersey
couldn't
enact
a
statute,
it
would
have
exactly
the
same
effect
as
the
camden
ordinance.
somehow
the
city
of
camden
can
do
it
because
there
is
an
ordinance
of
just
kind
of
local...
by
a
local
governing
body
rather
than
a
state-wide
law.
do
you
take
that
position?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
would
say
the
case
would
be
different.
at
least
you
would
be
making
a
different
argument
if
the
state
enacted
a
law
saying
that
40
percent
of
all
the
people
who
are
working
on
contracts
that
the
state
is
financing
must
be
residents
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
that
would
be
a
different
case.
i
don't
know
how
you
would...
at
least
you
would
say
that
case
is
not
here
because--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
foster?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
you
have
stated
this,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
do
you,
representing
the
mayor
and
council,
rely
on
the
proposition
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
does
not
apply
to
classifications
drawn
on
the
basis
of
a
municipal
as
opposed
to
state
residency?
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
the
first
point
in
your
corespondent's
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
every
municipality
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
did
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
gather
you
would
say
that
situation
would
present
a
problem
that
the
city
ordinance
does
not
under
the--
unknown
speaker
--and,
i
gather
you
don't
think
the
requirement
of
the
state's
approval
of
the
ordinance
makes
this
a
state
enactment
rather
than
a
municipal
one?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
earlier
said,
and
i
thought
it
made
good
sense,
that
even
if
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
passed
a
statute
saying
that
camden,
all
camden
contracts--
unknown
speaker
--should
have
40
percent
camden
residents
employed,
that
it
would
be
the
same
case.
unknown
speaker
because
it
would
be
conditioned
on
municipal
residency
rather
than
state
residency.
unknown
speaker
would
it
also
be
the
same
case
if
the
new
jersey
legislation
said
every
city
such
as
camden
and
every
other
new
jersey
city
bordering
on
another
state
shall
require
local
residency
as
a
requirement,
sort
of
applied
to
each
of
the
cities
if
you
can
cross
the
river
and
commute
to?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
other
rivers.
there
are
different
rivers
i
believe.
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
some
part
of
new
jersey
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
just
as
a
matter
of
interest--
unknown
speaker
--has
the
population
of
camden
declined
in
the
decade
of
the
70s?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
present
population
is
on
relief?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
city
attorney
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
anyone
has
been
injured?
unknown
speaker
why
not
file
suit
when
that
happens?
unknown
speaker
why
not
file
suit
when
that
happens?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
do
agree
that
nobody...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
anybody
applied
for
a
job
and
was
denied
employment?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
one
suggests
that...
at
least
under
our
cases
there
is
a
limit
on
what
they
can
do
about
private
employment.
unknown
speaker
we
are
just
talking
about
public
employment
here.
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
the
employment
by
contractors
doing
business
with
the
city.
