mr.
richard
g.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
simple
subpoena
case.
such
characterization
is
misleading
and
erroneous.
it
is
somewhat
glib,
and
it
is
made
by
government
appellate
attorneys
from
afar.
those
who
have
been
directly
involved
with
this
case
including
the
district
court
judge
were
intimately
aware
of
the
facts.
the
issues
basically
involved
entry,
and
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
the
facts
were
stipulated
there
were
at
the
outset
unilateral
scheduling
of
an
inspection
appointment
date.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
i
believe
it
is
in
the--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--yes,
it
is
in
the
appendix,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
right.
the
labor
department
basically
was
informing
lone
steer
that
it
was
about
to
enter
and
inspect
the
premises,
question
employees
and
generally
conduct
its
normal
investigation.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
they
did
ultimately.
the
issue
became--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--they
entered
i
believe
it
was
february
2nd
of
1981.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
they
entered
following
the
institution
of
a
law
suit
by
lone
steer
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
on
section
11.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
the
labor
department,
a
compliance
officer,
mr.
godes
from
bismarck
together
with
some
high
ranking
labor
department
official
flown
in
from
denver
entered
the
lone
steer
to
attempt
to
conduct
the
investigation
on
the
premises
showing,
attempting
to
show
that
section
11--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--well,
they
entered
and
attempted
to
conduct
the
investigation.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
they
entered
the
lone
steer
cafe
in
steele,
north
dakota
and
sought
to
conduct
an
investigation
there.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
they
did
enter
it.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
they
were
turned
away,
right.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
right.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
no,
your
honor,
and
i
certainly
did
not
seek
to
give
the
court
that
impression.
if
i
could
give
you
a
short
scenario
of
what
exactly
happened--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--only
from
a...
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
it
is
basically
in
the
stipulated
facts.
we
had
two
instances
where
lone
steer's
attorney
told
the
labor
department
that
they
did
not
have
authority
or
consent
to
conduct
its
investigation
on
the
premises
of
lone
steer.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
no,
your
honor,
definitely
not.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
no.
we're
saying--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
your
honor,
in
the
first
instance
what
they
sought
to
do
was
to
conduct
the
investigation.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
they
informed
us
by
way
of
a
letter
that
they
were
going
to
attempt
to
conduct
the
investigation
and
if
they
were
prohibited...
that
was
the
word
used...
if
they
were
prohibited
from
conducting
the
investigation
they
were
going
to
leave
an
administrative
subpoena.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
your
honor,
at
that
point
prior
to
that
the
issue
was
under
section
11
whether
or
not
the
inspection
powers
of
the
labor
department
were
limited
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
interpreted
by
barlow's,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
as
the
court
perceived
it
and
as
we
perceived
it
we
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
labor
department
did
have
the
right
to
conduct
the
investigation
without
the
consent
of
the
owner.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
he
did
not
really
give
a
reason
for
that
ruling
other
than
to
say
that
the
inspection
power
under
section
11
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
clearly
in
his
mind
at
least
subject
to
the
warrant
clause
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
interpreted
in
barlow's.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
the
subpoena
as
we
understand
the
subpoena
is
an
enforcement
device
as
a
part
of
section
11's
conferring
of
inspection
powers
to
enter
and
inspect
the
premises.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
either
section
11
is
subject
to
the
warrant
clause
or
it
isn't.
i
believe
that
it
is
subject
to
section
11,
and
the
labor
department
did
not
or
left
undisturbed
the
judgment
with
respect
to
entry.
the
judgement
with
respect
to
entry
right
now
stands
that
section
11
is
subject
to
the
warrant
clause.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
i
would
argue--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--i
would
argue
there,
your
honor,
that
a
subpoena
is
subject
to
barlow
principles.
a
subpoena
can
be
enforced
under
barlow
principles,
and
it
would
be
subject
to
the--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--yes,
they
have
subpoena
power
which
i
believe
was
limited
by
barlow's--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--i
think
what
this
court
has
to
do
consistent
with
barlow's
is
to
look
at
the
entire
investigatory
scheme
and
see
that
a
subpoena
is
being
used
and
enforced
in
federal
district
court,
and
the
test
there
would
be
whether
or
not
the
subpoena
and
an
enforcement
would
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
ultimately
in
an
enforcement
action.
it
could
have
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
because
of
the
particular
way
the
statute
is
postured
in
terms
of
entry.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
your
honor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
oklahoma
press
publishing
was
perhaps
altered
to
a
certain
extent
and
perhaps
certain
grey
areas
were
filled
in
in
that
a
subpoena
could
issue
but
the
test
of
reasonableness
would
involve
barlow
substantive
principles,
for
example,
the
issue
of
probable
cause
limiting
properly
the
scope
of
the
investigation
to
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
to
the
extent
that
the
labor
department
there
sought
certain
i
believe
it
was
health
accident
reports
and
so
forth
that
are
required
by
the
osha
law.
an
inspection
was
sought
of
those
documents.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
however,
in
footnote
22
you
pointed
out
that
delineating
the
scope
of
a
search
with
some
care
is
particularly
important
where
documents
are
involved.
at
a
certain
point
you
indicated
it
is
the
secretary's
position
which
we
reject
that
an
inspection
of
documents
of
this
scope
may
be
effective
without
a
warrant.
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
entry
provisions
of
this
particular
statute,
section
11,
which
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind,
there
is
no
question
in
the
district
court's
mind
and
apparently
there
is
no
question
in
the
labor
department's
mind,
is
subject
to
the
warrant
clause
on
barlow's.
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
then
say
section
11
is
subject
to
the
warrant
clause;
however,
the
subpoena
is
not
which
is
the
enforcement
device.
i
believe
that
essentially
the
cases
are
the
same,
barlow's
and
lone
steer.
the
only
difference
occurred
when
entry
was
denied
and
an
enforcement
mechanism
under
a
particular
statute
was
utilized.
in
the
barlow's
case
it
involved
a
compulsory
process
to
enter,
and
as
i
read
barlow's
the
labor
department
did
not
contend
that
that
compulsory
process
was
the
equivalent
of
a
warrant.
you
did
indicate
that
it
could
be
viewed
as
such
in
one
of
your
footnotes.
the
same
is
true
in
this
particular
case.
we
have
to
look
at
the
enforcement
mechanism
of
section
11,
and
in
this
case
it
is
the
subpoena,
a
subpoena
that
is
issued
by
the
labor
department
itself
without
regard
to
probable
cause
and
without
properly
limiting
the
scope
of
the
investigation
to
the
purpose
or
the
probable
cause
involved.
again,
i
would
have
to
iterate
and
reiterate
that
the
case
involved
a
declaratory
judgment
at
a
particular
time.
on
february
1,
1981
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
labor
department
had
a
right
to
come
in
and
conduct
an
investigation
over
the
objection
of
an
owner.
when
lone
steer
objected
twice
through
its
attorney
that
you
cannot
come
in
without
a
warrant
or
its
functional
equivalent,
the
labor
department
then
cited
in
its
letter
its
inspection
powers
under
section
11
to
enter
and
conduct
an
inspection.
at
that
point
there
was
a
dispute
as
far
as
the
district
court
was
concerned
as
to
whether
or
not
the
labor
department
did
in
fact
have
a
right
to
enter
and
inspect.
following
the
initiation
of
that
law
suit
the
labor
department
despite
all
these
protestations
through
the
legal
counsel
and
through
the
court
system
the
labor
department
still
sought
to
conduct
that
inspection
on
the
premises
of
lone
steer.
it
is--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--without
the
consent
of--
mr.
richard
g.
peterson
--yes,
they
are
two
distinct
issues,
but
if
section
11
is
subject
to
the
warrant
clause
under
a
barlow's
test
type
of
analysis
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
you
have
to
also
apply
that
analysis
to
the
enforcement
mechanism
of
that
right
under
section
11.
in
fact
the
labor
department
is
saying
that
it
is
seeking
to
inspect
the
documents
under
the
subpoena
under
section
11.
they
are
citing
section
11
and
section
9.
i
seriously
question
whether
or
not
the
labor
department
can
conduct
its
investigation
without
utilizing
the
authority
of
section
11
which
is
a
right
to
enter
provision.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
