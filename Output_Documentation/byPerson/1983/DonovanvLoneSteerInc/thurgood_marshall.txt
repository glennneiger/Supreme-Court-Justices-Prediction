did
they

is
it
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
they

you
now
said
they

justice

a

and

had
they
not

in
would
you
be
making
the

argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical.
the
same
type
of
subpoena
is
issued
to
another
corporation
which
has
only
been
in
business
a
week.
would
you
be
arguing
the
same
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
only
been
a
week
because
i
do
not
want
anything
in
the
past
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
have
no
subpoena
power.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
they
exercise
the
subpoena
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
every
subpoena
would
have
to
have
court
approval?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
this
type
of
subpoena
need
court
action,
others
do
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
it
involves
this
particular
statute?
