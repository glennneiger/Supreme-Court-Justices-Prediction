well,
did
the
subpoena
here
actually
request
entry?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
find
that
the
court
referred
to
oklahoma
press
at
all.
unknown
speaker
was
this
pressed
upon
the
court
by
the
united
states
attorney?
unknown
speaker
judge
van
sickle
had
oklahoma
press.

unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
did
barlow's
deal
with
papers
and
records?
unknown
speaker
did
barlow's
even
cite
oklahoma
press?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
get
relief
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
subpoena
under
oklahoma

speaker
so
what
you
say
is
basically
you
are
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
that
would
say
the
labor
department
does
not
have
the
authority
to
enter
and
inspect
notwithstanding--
unknown
speaker
--without
the
consent
of
the
owner
notwithstanding
that
we
might
resolve
the
subpoena
question
in
favor
of
the
government.
you
see
them
as
two
distinct
issues
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
