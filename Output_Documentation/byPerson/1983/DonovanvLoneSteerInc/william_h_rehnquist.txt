where
do
we
find
the
stipulation?
in
the
briefs
or
the
appendix?
justice
william

is
it
in
the
appendix
somewhere?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
peterson,
you
used
the
word
"enter"
as
if
to
give
almost
a
feeling
of
breaking
down
the
door.
your
paragraph
10
of
the
stipulation
says
that
at
approximately
10:30
a.m.
godes
and
hill
entered
the
lone
steer
establishment
to
attempt
to
conduct
an
investigation.
they
asked
for
ms.
white
and
were
told
she
was
not
available
but
expected
shortly.
they
were
offered
some
coffee
and
waited
in
the
lobby
area.
after
20
to
30
minutes
when
ms.
white
had
not
appeared
mr.
godes
served
an
administrative
subpoena
on
employee
karen
arnold.
do
you
mean
by
the
use
of
the
word
"entered"
kind
of
entered
against
the
will
of
the
parties?
