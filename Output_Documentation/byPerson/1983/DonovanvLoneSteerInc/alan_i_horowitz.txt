mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1252
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
north
dakota.
under
review
is
the
district
court's
decision
holding
unconstitutional
the
investigative
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
specifically
the
court's
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
of
an
administrative
subpoena
for
the
inspection
of
documents
and
rather
requires
that
a
search
warrant
be
obtained
before
any
documents
may
be
examined.
because
some
of
the
briefs
here
have
generated
some
confusion
about
the
issue
presented
i
think
it
would
be
useful
to
summarize
briefly
the
background
of
this
litigation.
on
january
6,
1982
al
godes,
the
wage
hour
compliance
officer,
telephoned
appellee,
a
restaurant-motel,
located
in
steele,
north
dakota
to
schedule
an
inspection
for
the
following
day
and
to
ask
that
certain
wage
and
payroll
records
be
made
available
for
inspection
at
that
time.
when
appellee's
manager
informed
godes
that
the
time
was
not
convenient
he
rescheduled
the
inspection
for
the
following
week.
in
the
interim
appellee's
counsel
wrote
to
mr.
godes
stating
that
appellee
would
not
consider
the
request
for
an
inspection
until
it
was
informed
of
either
the
nature
of
the
complaint
that
triggered
the
investigation
or
the
scope
of
the
investigation.
the
government
responded
with
a
letter
outlining
the
general
scope
of
a
fair
labor
standards
investigation
and
declining
to
give
the
reason
for
this
particular
investigation.
in
this
letter
the
government
rescheduled
the
inspection
for
two
weeks
hence.
the
letter
also
requested
appellee
to
inform
the
government
whether
it
would
decline
to
permit
the
inspection
so
that
an
administrative
subpoena
could
be
obtained
in
that
event.
appellee
responded
that
permission
would
be
refused
under
the
authority
of
marshall
v.
barlow's
and
thereafter
appellee
was
served
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
requiring
production
of
specified
payroll
records
at
the
department
of
labor's
wage
hour
offices
in
bismarck,
north
dakota.
appellee's
counsel
informed
the
department
of
labor
that
it
would
not
comply
with
the
subpoena
on
the
ground
that
it
was
invalid
under
barlow's,
and
to
date
it
has
not
produced
the
subpoena
documents.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
just
do
not
think
there
is
any
support
for
that
in
the
record.
all
we
know
is
that
they
phoned
and...
the
government
phoned
and
said
that
it
wanted
to
conduct
an
inspection
the
next
day.
appellee
obviously
did
not
feel
compelled
to
comply
with
this.
it
simply
first
stated
that
it
wasn't
convenient
and
then
later
declined
to
permit
the
government
to
enter.
in
the
brief--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it
has
never
come
up
because
the
general
practice
of
the
labor
department
is
not
to
conduct
these
entries
without
consent
so
they
did
not
try
to
do
it
here.
they
have
never
tried
to
do
it.
if
they
did--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--if
they
did
i
think
unlike
this
case
barlow's
would
be
quite
relevant
and
there
would
be
a
serious
question
under
barlow's,
but
the
question
would
be
whether
barlow's
was
distinguishable
or
not.
it
might
be
difficult
to
distinguish.
barlow's
itself
was
careful
to
confine
itself
to
the
osha
context
so
arguably
it
might
be
distinguishable,
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
close
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
the
subpoena
specifically
said
that
it
was
returnable
off
the
premises,
that
the
documents
were
to
be
produced
at
the
labor
department's
office
in
bismarck,
north
dakota.
i
should
say
also
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
original
question
the
appellee
has
said
and
the
briefs
in
this
court
have
characterized
the
department
of
labor's
initial
phone
call
as
sort
of
a
demand
for
entry
and
tried
to
paint
the
picture
that
we
were
trying
to
force
our
way
in.
that's
something
that's
come
up
in
the
course
of
litigation.
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
more
contemporaneous
discussion
of
what
was
going
on
the
letter
that
i
just
referred
to
that
appellee
sent
to
the
government
that
is
reproduced
at
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix
mr.
peterson
stated
"i
represent
lone
steer
cafe.
"
"before
we
consider
your
request
to
conduct
an
inspection
we
would
like
the
following
information.
"
so
i
think
at
least
at
the
time
everyone
understood
that
this
was
just
a
request
to
enter
the
premises.
it
was
only
later
that
this
has
been
characterized
more
as
a
demand.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
the
subpoena
was
served.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
filed
as
i
was
about
to
say
we
filed
a
petition
with
the
district
court
to
compel
appellees
to
comply
with
this
subpoena.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
cases
were
consolidated
so
the
order
does
rule
on
it.
it
is
a
little
cryptic.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
he
does
not
mention
it,
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that
is
what
the
order
says.
in
the
course
of
the
court's
opinion
he
states
that
the
appellee's
contention
is
that
they
are
not
required
to
turn
over
these
documents
in
response
to
this
subpoena
so
the
court
seems
to
have
understood
that
what
this
case
was
about
was
a
subpoena,
but
then
when
it
gets
to
drafting
the
order
it
just
says
that
government
can't
enter
on
the
premises.
at
that
point
the
government
filed
a
motion
to
amend
the
judgment
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
all
we
wanted
was
for
the
documents
to
be
turned
over
at
our
offices.
the
court
did
not
really
address
that
very
well
either
so
perhaps
the
district
court
did
not
exactly
focus
on
what
was
going
on
here,
but
i
think
it
is
made
clear
enough
in
all
the
papers
that
have
been
filed.
when
appellee
declined
to
permit
the
inspection
originally
the
government
responded
with
a
letter
that
outlined
the
general
scope
of
the
investigation
of
a
fair
labor
standards
general
investigation
but
declined
to
give
the
reason
for
this
particular
investigation,
and
as
i
said
we
requested
that
appellee
inform
the
government
whether
it
would
consent...
decline
to
permit
the
inspection
so
the
subpoena
could
be
obtained.
when
appellee
declined
to
permit
the
inspection
a
department
of
labor
officer
went
to
the
premises
on
february
the
2nd
and
served
him
with
the
subpoena.
the
appellee
brought
this
law
suit
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
grounds
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
unconstitutional
and
quoting
from
the
complaint
"insofar
as
it
purports
to
authorize
a
warrantless
inspection
of
records
by
way
of
administrative
subpoena
after
entry
to
inspect
has
been
denied.
"
this
action
was
consolidated
with
the
government's
action
as
discussed
earlier
petitioning
the
district
court
to
compel
appellee
to
comply
with
the
subpoena,
and
the
district
court
found
for
the
appellee
without
really
explaining
why.
the
court's
opinion
relied
exclusively
on
marshall
v.
barlow's
and
accepted
the
appellee's
contention
that
the
subpoena
was
invalid
under
barlow's.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
the
court--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
certainly
was
featured
quite
heavily
in
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
oklahoma
press
case,
but
it
was
not
really
discussed
by
the
appellee
and
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
discuss
it
either.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
he
did.
as
we've
stated
in
our
briefs
we
view
this
as
a
straightforward
case
governed
by
principles
that
have
been
well
settled
by
this
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
it
is
certainly
strange.
at
the
beginning
of
the
court's
opinion
or
at
least
at
the
beginning
of
discussing
the
issues
at
the
bottom
of
page
6a
in
framing
the
issue
the
court
says
in
the
last
paragraph
there
on
page
6a
"lone
steer
asserts
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
constitutionally
impermissible
and
that
the
records
described
in
the
administrative
subpoena
issued
in
this
case
need
not
be
produced
except
in
response
to
a
warrant.
"
so
the
court
certainly
took
cognizance
there
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
subpoena
issued,
and
that's
what
was
involved.
but
then
the
court
just
goes
on
to
discuss
barlow's
and
then
kind
of
falls
back
onto
this
discussion
of
entry
onto
the
premises.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we
did
suggest
summary
reversal,
but
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
act
on
that
suggestion.
the
case
is
here
today
because
of
the
direct
appeal
provisions
of
section
1252
in
light
of
the
district
court's
finding
of
unconstitutionality.
it
is
not
because
this
case
presents
an
unsettled
constitutional
question.
i
would
like
if
i
might
briefly
to
emphasize
just
a
few
points
in
this
connection.
at
the
outset
let
me
emphasize
again
that
the
only
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
served
upon
appellee,
that
is,
requiring
the
production
of
documents
off
premises
without
resort
to
a
search
warrant.
perhaps
because
the
validity
of
such
subpoena
is
so
clearly
established
by
this
court's
precedent
appellee
and
the
amicae
supporting
it
have
sought
to
cloud
this
issue
by
suggesting
that
this
case
involves
an
attempted
nonconsensual
entry
onto
private
premises.
this
is
simply
not
so.
there
is
no
question
here
of
an
entry
onto
private
premises
without
consent
as
there
was
in
barlow's.
the
government
never
made
any
attempt
to
enter
and
the
department
of
labor's
general
policy
is
not
to
make
such
entries.
from
the
time
the
subpoena
was
served
almost
every
document
in
the
record
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
the
district
court's
opinion
confirms
that
this
litigation
has
focused
on
the
validity
of
the
subpoena.
only
one
week
after
the
subpoena
was
served
appellee
wrote
the
government,
sent
a
copy
of
this
letter
to
the
district
court
stating
that
it
would
not
comply
with
the
subpoena
because
it
was
invalid
under
barlow's.
appellee's
complaint,
the
government's
petition
to
enforce
this
subpoena,
the
district
court's
own
description
of
the
issue
presented
in
its
opinion
and
the
motions
for
summary
judgment
all
focus
on
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
subpoena.
on
this
issue
appellee's
contention
is
foreclosed
by
a
long
line
of
precedent
of
this
court.
in
oklahoma
press
this
court
unequivocally
held
that
an
administrative
subpoena,
indeed
in
that
case
a
subpoena
issued
under
the
very
statute
involved
here,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
a
subpoena
is
not
governed
by
the
requirements
of
the
warrant
clause.
that
is,
neither
a
warrant
nor
probable
cause
is
required
for
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena.
the
court
explained
that
a
subpoena
does
not
involve
any
actual
search
of
private
matters.
it
is
a
search
only
in
a
theoretical
sense,
what
the
court
termed
a
constructive
search.
the
court
concluded,
therefore,
that
a
subpoena
is
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
the
request
is
authorized
by
law,
is
not
indefinite
or
unduly
burdensome
and
seeks
documents
that
are
relevant
to
the
investigation.
this
rule
has
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
morton
salt
and
several
other
subsequent
cases
and
has
been
routinely
and
uniformly
applied
to
administrative
subpoenas
for
the
last
40
years.
neither
appellee
or
the
district
court
discusses
oklahoma
press
and
its
progeny.
no
defect
in
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
those
cases
nor
any
reason
for
concluding
that
those
cases
were
wrongly
decided
has
been
suggested.
the
sole
basis
for
the
decision
below
and
for
appellee's
argument
is
the
assumption
that
this
long
line
of
cases
has
been
wiped
off
the
books
overruled
sub
silentio
by
barlow's.
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
this
assumption.
barlow's
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
or
with
oklahoma
press.
barlow's
involved
an
actual
search,
an
entry
onto
a
manufacturer's
private
business
premises
and
a
search
of
those
premises
for
evidence
of
safety
and
health
violations.
this
is
the
precise
sort
of
investigative
tool
with
which
the
court
in
oklahoma
press
contrasted
a
subpoena
and
drew
a
distinction.
barlow's
did
not
suggest
any
erosion
of
the
traditional
distinction
between
subpoenas
and
actual
searches.
indeed
barlow's
relied
heavily
on
see
v.
city
of
seattle
an
earlier
case
where
the
court
had
established
a
warrant
requirement
for
fire
inspections,
inspections
that
required
an
entry
onto
private
premises.
in
the
course
of
that
decision,
however,
the
court
expressly
reaffirmed
the
distinction
drawn
in
oklahoma
press
between
subpoenas
and
actual
searches
and
reaffirmed
the
standards
set
forth
there
under
which
such
subpoenas
are
to
be
judged.
barlow's
and
following
see
did
not
interfere
with
these
standards.
morever,
the
problems
with
osha
inspections
primarily
concerned
the
court
in
barlow's.
that
is,
the
unbridled
expression
of
officers
in
the
field
to
conduct
inspections
and
the
unlimited
nature
of
the
search
involved
do
not
exist
with
subpoenas.
the
subpoena
is
not
open
ended.
it
specifically
identifies
the
documents
sought.
the
subpoena
is
not
left
to
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
officer
in
the
field.
it
may
be
issued
only
by
the
wage
hour
administrator
and
enforced
only
by
resort
to
adversary
court
proceedings.
in
short,
nothing
in
barlow's
casts
any
doubt
on
the
continued
validity
of
oklahoma
press
or
on
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
returnable
off
premises
that
was
issued
in
this
case.
thus,
to
repeat
we
believe
that
well
settled
supreme
court
precedent
clearly
controls
the
disposition
of
this
case
and
requires
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
fourth
amendment
would
give
any
protection
or
not
against
sort
of
being
singled
out.
it
might
be
that
the
due
process
clause
or
something
could
have
some
sort
of
selective
prosecution
kind,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
difficult
standard
to
meet
certainly.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
any
questions.
