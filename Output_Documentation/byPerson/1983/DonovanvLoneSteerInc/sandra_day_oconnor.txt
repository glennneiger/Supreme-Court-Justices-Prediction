mr.
horowitz,
do
the
appellees
suggest
that
maybe
this
was
really
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
get
unauthorized
entry
into
the
premises?
would
you
comment
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
question
is
not
really
before
us
here,
of
course,
but
do
you
think
the
statutory
authority
under
the
act
to
enter
and
inspect
the
premises
is
possibly
invalid
under
barlow's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
is
possibly
invalid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
one,
mr.
horowitz.
again,
i
do
not
think
it
is
really
raised
here
but
do
you
think
there
are
any
limits
in
addition
to
those
spelled
out
in
oklahoma
press
on
the
government's
subpoena
power?
could
a
person
whose
records
are
being
subpoenaed,
for
example,
seek
a
protective
order
from
the
court
on
the
grounds
that
he'd
been
singled
out
or
was
being
harassed
and,
therefore,
the
subpoena
wouldn't
issue?
are
there
any
limits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peterson,
does
not
oklahoma
press
clearly
say
that
subject
to
the
requirements
spelled
out
there
administrative
subpoenas
can
issue
without
the
concerns
expressed
in
barlow's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
barlow's
did
not
overrule
oklahoma
press.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
have
to
read
a
lot
into
barlow's
to
think
that
do
you
not?
