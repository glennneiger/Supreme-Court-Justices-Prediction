justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
was
the
subpoena
ever
served?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
ever
file
a
motion
for
contempt
for
failing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
judge's
order
does
not
rule
on
that
though
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
does
not
mention
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
he
denies...
really
all
he
says
you
have
no
right
to
enter
the
premises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
horowitz,
maybe
i've
already
asked
it
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
not
only
in
his
judgment
but
also
in
his
opinion
all
he
mentions
is
the
right
to
enter.
he
did
not
write
another
opinion
that
somehow
did
not
get
in
the
papers
did
he
because
the
strangest
thing
to
me
about
this
case
is
the
judge's
total
failure
to
mention
anything
about
complying
with
the
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
peterson,
the
stipulation
goes
on
and
says
they
did
properly
serve
the
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
subpoena
commands
the
production
of
a
person
to
testify
and
to
bring
with
him
certain
records
to
the
federal
building
in
bismarck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
you
not
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
understand
the
district
court
to
have
ruled
that
you
did
not
have
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
reason
did
he
give
for
that
ruling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
talked
only
of
entries
onto
the
premises.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
subpoena
asks
for
production
elsewhere.
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should
not
comply
with
a
subpoena
to
produce
elsewhere?
