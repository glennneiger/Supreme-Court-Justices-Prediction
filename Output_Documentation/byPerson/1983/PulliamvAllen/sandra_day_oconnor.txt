mr.
attorney
general,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
for
the
normal
costs
of
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
indeed,
congress
tried
to
treat
attorneys'
fees
as
costs,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
the
statute,
did
it
not
attempt
to
treat
attorneys'
fees
as
costs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
other
remedies
would
your
client
have
had
to
solve
this
problem
in
virginia?
could
he
have
sought
habeas
corpus
release?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
no
habeas
corpus
relief
possible
in
virginia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
could
have
filed
pro
se
for
habeas.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
some
provision
in
virginia
law
by
which
pretrial
detention
orders
can
be
taken
up
to
the
next
highest
court,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
available?
