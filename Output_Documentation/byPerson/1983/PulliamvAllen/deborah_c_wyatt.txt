ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
$7000
award
of
attorneys'
fees
which
has
been
paid
by
the
state,
an
award
which
was
entered
following
the
correction
of
a
glaring
constitutional
violation,
a
violation
of
the
rights
of
my
indigent
clients.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
judicial
immunity
is
going
to
defeat
such
an
award,
defeat
such
vindication.
as
petitioner
described,
this
case
stems
from
a
practice
by
a
local
county
magistrate
of
incarcerating
persons
for
nonincarcerable
offenses
when
they
could
not
post
bond.
it
was
a
practice
which
in
a
five
month
period
affected
approximately
50
people,
34
of
whom
were
incarcerated,
including
my
two
clients.
one
of
my
clients
was
incarcerated
for
14
days
when
he
couldn't
post
a
$250
bond
for
a
nonincarcerable
offense.
the
other
client
was
incarcerated
four
times
in
a
two-month
period
for
nonincarcerable
offenses,
for
charges
of
nonincarcerable
offenses.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
question
to
this
case
because
they
could
not
have
sought
any
other
remedy
because
along
with
the
practice
of
incarcerating
persons
for
nonincarcerable
offenses,
they
were
being
appointed
no
counsel,
they
were
being
given
no
advice
of
rights,
they
were
being
locked
away.
for
them
there
was
no
appeal.
now,
there
is
a
provision
for
appealing
bail.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
there
is
habeas
corpus
relief
available,
as
there
are
appeals,
but
not
for
my
clients;
not
when
they
had
no
counsel
and
no
advice
of
rights.
they
had
no
ability
to
make
use
of
those
provisions,
and
moreover--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--had
they
known
how,
perhaps,
and
had
time
permitted,
because
these
incarcerations
were
as
long
as
14
days
and
as
short
as
2
days,
and
i
think
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
gerstein
v.
pugh,
often
these
issues
will
not
be
heard
in
time
to
make
them...
to
make
these
remedies
meaningful.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that
is
correct,
there
are
appeal--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that
was
available
to
them
had
they
had
the
ability
and
the
time
to
pursue
them.
they
did
not.
furthermore,
we
are
not
dealing
with
isolated
incidents.
we
are
dealing
with
a
practice.
even
if
they
had
cured
one
after
the
other,
it
was
a
continuing
practice.
respondent
nicholson,
as
soon
as
he
got
out,
he
was
being
reincarcerated,
sometimes
again
for
as
short
as
two
days,
and
whether
he
could
have
effected
an
appeal
in
that
period
of
time
i
think
is
doubtful.
and
again,
i
think
it
is
very
similar
to
what
was
recognized
in
gerstein
v.
pugh
along
those
lines.
petitioner
was
sued
only
in
her
official
capacity,
and
at
that
level
judicial
immunity
was
really
not
truly
raised.
it
was
never
raised
at
all
with
regard
to
declaratory
judgment.
the
only
issue
appealed,
moreover,
was
the
attorney
fee
award,
and
that
is
really
the
only
issue
that
is
properly
before
this
court,
and
it
was
the
only
issue
addressed
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
attorney
fee
award,
when
prospective
relief
has
been
granted,
whatever
the
validity
of
judicial
immunity,
whatever
validity
it
might
have
had
on
the
merits,
had
it
been
properly
raised
and
had
it
been
considered,
that
is
not
before
the
court.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
certainly.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
the
judicial
immunity
issue
on
prospective
relief
was
not
raised
in
the
lower
court.
if
i
said--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
i
believe
if
you
will
review
the
record,
you
will
see
that
they
raised
judicial
immunity
as
to
attorneys'
fees,
as
to
injunctive
relief,
but--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--are
you
referring
to--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--immune
from
liability,
your
honor,
if
you
continue
and
read
the
memorandum,
they
make
clear
they
mean
liability
from
damages
and
attorneys'
fees,
and
they
elucidate.
they
never
challenged
on
judicial
immunity
grounds
the
declaratory
judgment.
this
memorandum
that
is
accompanying
that
and
that
follows
the
motion
in
that
case,
i
don't
believe
anywhere
in
the
pleadings
you
will
find
any
assertion
that
declaratory
judgment
is
barred
by
judicial
immunity.
again,
when
they
say
liability,
they
elucidate
in
the
memorandum
they
mean
liability
from
damages.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
again,
i
do
not
believe
the
record
will
ever
show
any
judicial
immunity
with
regard
to
declaratory
judgment
ever
raised.
but
even
if
it
had
been,
of
course--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
we
did
not,
but
we
did
ask
for
attorneys'
fees,
and
they
did
at
that
point
raise
an
objection
to
attorney
fee
awards,
and
that
is
all
that
is
before
this
court
because
that
is
all
that
they
appealed.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
passed
1988--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
only
insofar
as
it
was
not
raised.
they
did
raise
judicial
immunity
with
regard
to
injunctive
relief.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
believe
under
gomez
v.
toledo
it
is
a
defense
to
be
raised
as
a
defense,
and
to
the
extent
it
wasn't
raised
with
declaratory
judgment,
it
might
be
considered
so.
i--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--it
may
be
considered
waived
as
to
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
never
said
waive.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
the
only
issue,
however,
the
only
issue
that
was
appealed,
whatever
happened
at
the
district
court
level,
was
the
attorney
fee
award.
congress
made
clear
in
its
language
and
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
intended
these
attorney
fee
awards
to
be
entered
not
only
against
defendants
for
whom
prospective
relief
is
entered,
but
most
particularly
in
cases
in
which
defendants
are
immune
from
damages.
the
language
on
its
face
is
very
clear,
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
for
congress
to
have
abrogated,
as
petitioner
discusses.
first
of
all,
damages
do
not
equal
attorneys'
fees.
to
say
that
damages
equal
attorneys'
fees
is
like
saying
interest
equal
principal
or
rent
equals
purchase
money:
they
spend
alike,
they
look
alike,
but
to
anyone
who
has
ever
borrowed
or
rented,
the
difference
is
a
complete
one;
and
to
congress
the
difference
was
complete.
congress
intended
the
attorney
fee
awards
to
step
in
most
particularly
where
damages
could
not
be.
and
this
court
has
recognized
that,
in
hutto
v.
finney
and
in
consumers
union,
supreme
court
of
virginia
v.
consumers
union,
there
this
court
recognized
that
prosecutors
immune
from
damage
awards
are
natural
targets
for
prospective
relief,
are
therefore
appropriate
defendants
for
attorney
fee
awards.
moreover,
even
if
this
court
were
to
consider
abrogation
necessary,
even
though
congress
intended
these
to
be
costs
ancillary
to
prospective
relief,
which
has
always
been
against
judicial
officers,
abrogation
there
is.
this
case
is
an
easier
one
than
hutto
v.
finney.
in
hutto
v.
finney
we
were
dealing
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
the
main
concerns
expressed
in
dissent
in
that
case
were
that
in
the
area
of
conflicting
interest
of
constitutional
dimension,
the
eleventh
and
fourteenth
amendments,
that
is
a
very
sensitive
area;
extra,
explicit
language
for
abrogation
is
necessary,
and
we
didn't
even
have
states
as
persons
under
1983.
in
the
present
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
conflicting
interests
of
constitutional
dimensions,
not
conflicting
interests
of
statutory
dimension.
we
are
not
conflicting
with
really
anything
but
an
enactment
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
a
judge-made
policy.
that
is
certainly
not
as
sensitive
an
area
as
two
conflicting
constitutional
provisions.
yet
we
have
more
explicit
indication.
judges
are
persons
under
1983.
states
are
not.
and
moreover,
congress
made
very
clear
that
one
of
the
purposes
in
fact
in
enacting
1988
was
to
make
these
remedies
available,
available
against
officials
who
are
immune
from
damages
awards.
this
court
said
that
in
consumers
union
where
this
court
stated,
and
i
quote,
"the
house
committee
report
on
the
act
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
permit
attorneys'
fees
awards
against,
when
prospective
relief
is
entered
against
defendants
immune
from
damages
awards.
"
this
court
recognizes,
congress
recognizes,
everywhere
in
congress',
in
the
senate
and
house
reports,
reference
is
made
to
newman
v.
piggie
park
which,
of
course,
was
a
case
where
it
was
recognized
that
when
damages
are
not
available,
that
is
when
injunctive
relief
is
all
that's
available,
and
it
is
so
much
more
important
then
to
have
attorney
fees
available,
and
this
case
exemplifies
that.
my
clients
are
indigent.
they
had
no
money
with
which
to
hire
a
lawyer.
they
could
not
sue
for
damages
to
which
an
attorney
might
look
for
a
contingent
fee.
they
were
dependent
on
the
incentive
provided
by
1988,
and
it
served
that
purpose.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
the
way
it
was
framed,
it
was
indefinite.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
she
would
be,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
of
course,
is
reaching
the
issue
of
the
underlying
relief,
the
prospective
relief.
i
think
it
may
have,
but
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
the
difference
in
prospective
and
retroactive
relief
as
in
the
eleventh
amendment
cases,
and
i
think
in
this
case
it
was
the
only
way
that
this
could
have
been
stopped.
she
was
the
natural
defendant;
she
was
engaged
in
a
practice.
there
might
have
been
some
other
people
that
could
have
been
sued,
and
in
fact,
before
this
case
was
filed,
suit
was
filed
in
the
same
court
on
behalf
of
the
same
person,
the
same
practice,
but
challenging,
suing
the
sheriff
and
the
commonwealth
attorney.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that's
right.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
it
is
my
reading
of
1988
that
it
really
is
only
applicable
in
cases
in
which
you
are
suing
someone
in
an
official
capacity,
the
specific
language
in
either
the
house
or
senate
report
indicating
that.
so
i
don't
think
we
had
1988.
now,
we
may
have
a
bad
faith
situation,
but
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
is
a
totally
different
analysis.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
it
would
be
my
position
that
1988,
if
it
applies,
applies
regardless
of
the
indemnification
statutes.
it's--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--no,
i
do
not
believe
it
could,
but
i
think
that
the
state
probably,
if
it
cares,
if
it
really
does
think
that
this
is
going
to
be
such
an
inhibitory
effect
on
its
state
judges,
will,
and
it
has
been
my
understanding
that
most
if
not
all
states
had
those,
and
in
fact,
i
thought
virginia
had,
and
again,
this
has
been
paid
by
the
state.
but
if
they
didn't,
i
think
that's
a
determination
for
the
state
to
make.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
would
find
absolutely
no
distinction--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--if
the
district
court--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
question
which
is
going
to
vary
perhaps
from
the
state.
again,
in
virginia,
the
attorney
general's
office
from
the
beginning
has
defended
petitioner,
but
that
is
for
congress
to
decide.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that's
my
understanding
of
congress'
intent,
yes.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
nothing
right
off
hand,
your
honor,
that
comes
to
mind.
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
intended
these
to
be,
and
that
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized
that
attorney
fees
are
not
supposed
to
be
a
second
major
source
of
litigation.
they
are
in
this
case
because
we
are
now
coming
in
through
the
back
door
and
challenging
the
merits.
normally
it
would
be
the
merits
alone.
but
i
think
it
also
points
out
the
fact
that
at
this
stage
we
are
not
talking
about
judicial
officers.
maybe
somewhere
a
judicial
officer
is
going
to
be
left
with
the
proverbial
hat-in-hand
approach.
i
think
it
is
most
unlikely.
again,
it
is
my
understanding
that
almost
all
states,
if
not
all
states--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--your
honor,
if
i
said
that,
i
misstated
myself.
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
would
have
that
power
to
say
that
they
world
have
to
indemnify
them.
i
think
that
is
something
that...
i
think
if
the
order
were
against
the
state,
we
would
have
hutto
v.
finney.
i
think
that
they
can
say
that
judicial
officers
can
be
sued.
we
have
already
recognized
that
in
pierson
v.
ray.
what
they
have
done
instead
is
said
we
are
going
to
assess
the
cost
of
litigation
when
injunctive
relief
is
all
that
can
be
available
for
just
a
case
as
this.
congress
can
do
that.
congress
has
done
that.
congress
intended
this.
if
in
some
instance
some
judge
is...
finds
himself
in
a
situation
where
he
is
responsible
for
his
own
fees,
he
is
certainly
not
in
a
different
position
than
all
the
other
officials,
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
who
is
not
immune
from
prospective
relief
and
therefore
presumptively
from
attorneys'
fees
if
they
applied,
of
course,
to
federal
officials.
we
have--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--not
in
that
language,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
if
i
sued
for
damages,
for
retroactive,
prelitigation
damages?
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
it
were
for--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--not
for
damages,
no,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
in
fact,
in
this
case
we
maintained--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--maintain
a
suit
for
attorneys'
fees?
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
possibly
so,
possibly
so.
there
have
been
decisions
which--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--there
is
one
case
of
which
i
am
aware
in
which
prelitigation
settlement
incurred
attorneys'
fees,
and
that
is
the
only
situation
in
which
i
could
even
see
it
characterized
as
suing
for
attorneys'
fees.
but
the
difference
there
is
this:
it
does
not
focus
for
one
moment
on
the
judge's
prelitigation
conduct.
it
doesn't
even
deal
with
bad
faith.
1988
is
only
going
to
be
between
lawyers
deciding
how
much
the
state
pays,
in
fact.
furthermore,
if
you,
a--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--it
was
my
understanding,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
if
your
honor
believes
that
attorney
fees
equal
damages,
however,
congress
made
clear
its
intent,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
congress
can
do
that.
congress
can
take
away
the
entire
immunity
under
pierson
v.
ray.
it
didn't
do
that.
instead,
it
simply
assessed
attorneys'
fees.
but
congress
made
clear,
it
is
mentioned
all
through
the
house
and
senate
reports,
the
fact
that
the
purpose
was
to
make
prospective
relief
available
in
theory
also
available
in
fact
by
removing
the
financial
obstacles.
it
does
cite
to
pierson
v.
ray,
but
that
is
not
the
only
indication
in
these
reports
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
i'm
sorry,
are
you
saying
is
that
one
citation
as--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
it
is
certainly
more
persuasive
than
what
was
available
in
hutto
v.
finney.
as
i
note
in
my
brief,
they
refer
to
preclusive
immunities,
and
the
only
preclusive
immunity
referred
to
was
in
pierson
v.
ray,
which
is
immunity
from
damages
of
judges.
but
there
are
many,
many
citations.
i
note
that
in
the
house
report
there
are
five
references
to
newman
v.
piggie
park.
in
the
senate
report
there
are
two.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
because
that
is
not...
because
a
legislator
is
not
going
to
be
a
defendant
in
a
suit
in
1983
at
all.
there
is
no
prospective
relief,
there
is
no
damage
relief,
there
is
no
suit
that
can
be
sustained.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
but
he
won
upon
this
court's
enunciation
that
legislators
are
absolutely
immune
in
the
absolute
sense;
the
legislative
process
is
immune
from
being
examined
by
the
judiciary,
and
you
will
not
have
a
legislator,
therefore,
against
whom
prospective
relief
is
entered,
or
damages,
for
that
matter,
and
therefore
you
will
never
have
1988
come
into
play.
if
you
did,
if
a
legislator
acted
in
some
other
capacity
and
was
an
appropriate
defendant,
yes,
1988
would
apply
to
him.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
no.
1988
is
confined
to
the
situation
in
which
relief
is
given.
there
is
a
prevailing
party
in
a
1983
action,
and
i
think
that
was
the
point
this
court
made
in
consumers
union.
legislators
cannot
be
sued
at
all.
therefore,
there's
never
going
to
be
attorneys'
fees.
prosecutors
can
be
sued,
if
only
for
prospective
relief,
and
therefore
there
are
going
to
be
attorneys'
fees.
that's
what
congress
intended.
judges,
because
their
immunities
are
so
like
prosecutors',
are
immune
from
damages
but
are
not
appropriate
candidates
for
prospective
relief,
and
consequently,
prospective...
for
immunity
from
prospective
relief,
and
therefore,
will
be
sued
for
prospective
relief,
should
be
able--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--that's
correct,
and
you
need
not
do
so
in
this
case
because
presumptively
it
was
correct.
we
don't
even
know.
we
don't
even
know
what
the
district
court
found
or
why
because
the
merits
were
not
appealed.
i
would
like
to
add,
though,
that
if
this
court
were
to
reach
that
issues,
it
is
a
very
dangerous
one
in
a
case
such
as
this.
there
really
is
not
any
alternative
remedy,
as
we
were
discussing
previously.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
pierson--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--not...
not
the
word
judges,
no.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
the
people
who
are
immune
from
damages,
or
the
unavailability
of
damage
remedies,
yes,
and
judges
by
implication
in
the
citation
of
pierson
v.
ray.
that's
the
only
official
they
could
have
been
referring
to
when
they
talked
about
preclusive
immunities
in
cite
to
pierson
v.
ray.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
pierson
v.
ray
dealt
with
police
officers
and
judges.
police
officers
were
not
entitled
to
preclusive
immunity.
there
were
three
cases
cited.
the
only
one
that
had
a
preclusive
immunity
was
pierson
v.
ray,
and
that
was
for
judges.
but
no,
they
didn't
use
the
term
judges.
throughout,
however,
1988,
there
are
references
to
the
principle
enunciated
in
newman
v.
piggie
park,
which
is
where
you
can't
get
damages,
the
private
attorney
general
enforcement
is
all
the
more
important,
and
in
fact,
this
case
exemplifies
that
as
well,
if
i
may.
the
public
attorney
general
vigorously
defended
the
conduct
in
this
case,
making
the
private
enforcement
all
the
more
important.
now,
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
this
application
of
1988
expanding
the
use
of
1983.
i
think
justice
harlan
concurring
in
bivens,
had
an
appropriate
perspective
to
that,
that
is
really
congress'
concern
and
should
not
cut
back
on
constitutional
rights.
but
certainly,
to
apply
that
principle
to
this
case
would
be
to
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water.
this
was
a
correct
application
of
1988.
it
served
the
vindication
purpose.
it
served
the
purpose
of
allowing
prospective
relief
to
be
had
by
persons
who
were
indigent,
could
not
have
gotten
it
otherwise.
it
served
the
private
attorney
general
purpose,
and
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
hutto,
in
white
v.
new
hampshire,
in
consumers
union,
that
attorneys'
fees
do
not
equal
damages.
again,
they
are
both
money,
but
they
are
different.
one,
congress
said,
is
to
be
ancillary...
they
said
this
in
the
house
and
senate
reports...
is
to
be
treated
as
ancillary,
which
of
course
ties
in
with
this
court's
language
regarding
the
eleventh
amendment,
ancillary
to
prospective
relief,
whether
we
like
it
or
not.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
principle
was
killed
in
alyeska.
what
was
resurrected
in
its
place
was
1988,
which
does
not...
really
does
not
give
any
provision
for
such
an
award
as
you
were
just
describing
short
of
bad
faith,
and
if
a
judge
has
been
vexatious,
delaying
the
litigation,
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized
in
furtherance
of
the
court's
docket
and
its
control
of
its
courts,
a
federal
court
could
give
a
bad
faith
award
to
a
judge.
these
concerns,
let
me
add,
are
equally
applicable
with
equal
or
more
force
to
all
other
officials
who
are
available
to
be
sued.
to
the
extent
that
this
applies
to
federal
judges,
as
petitioner
has
indicated,
it
can
apply
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
well,
which
this
court
has
held
is
not
immune
from
prospective
relief.
he
can
be
stopped.
a
local
magistrate
should
be
able
to
be
stopped,
always
has
been.
and
there
is
no
more
chilling,
inhibiting
effect
on
a
local
magistrate
than
on
anyone
else
against
whom
1988
attorneys'
fees
can
be
assessed,
and
then
paid,
in
most
cases,
all
cases
of
which
i
am
aware,
by
the
state.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
on
the
prospective
relief,
if
i
can.
in
addition
to
the
fact
there
was
no
alternative
remedy,
there
is
no
sound
justification
for
this
extension.
moreover,
pierson,
imbler,
tenney
all
rested,
all
rested
on
the
proposition
that
these
immunities
there
were
so
firmly
entrenched,
so
well
grounded
in
history
and
reason
that
it
had
to
be
assumed
congress
took
them
into
account
in
passing
1983.
and
because
it
made
no
mention
of
it,
they
survived
1983.
what
can
be
said
about
immunity
from
prospective
relief?
judges
have
never
been
considered
immune
from
prospective
relief,
as
this
court
as
recognized
as
recently
as
1981,
and
therefore,
i
think
it--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--there
certainly
is,
your
honor,
or
we
would
not
have
had
an
anti-injunction
act
almost
from
the
time
this
country
began,
and
we
certainly
have
cases
such
as
mitchum
v.
foster,
boddie
v.
connecticut
which
really
would
be
thrown
out
into
the
twilight
zone
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
there
was
now,
for
the
first
time,
immunity
from
prospective
relief.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
your
honor,
i
believe
the
anti-injunction
act
is
aimed
at
the
courts,
but
this
court
has
recognized
if
you
sue
the
party
such
as
the
prosecutor,
that
that
still
can
come
under
the
anti-injunction
act.
that
is
a
device
that
was
used
and
which
was
criticized,
but
it
is
the
court's,
and
this
court
has
had
cases
before
it
reaching
the
merits
where
judges
have
been
defendants
for
prospective
relief.
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
when
you
have...
and
it's
going
to
be
rare...
a
defendant
who
is
a
judge
who
is
the
natural
defendant
in
a
case,
who
is
denying
indigent
the
right
of
appeal,
throwing
out
all
cases
brought
by
blacks,
ordering
women
sterilized
on
ex
parte
hearings,
incarcerating
persons
for
nonincarcerable
offenses--
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
--i
think
it
could
be,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
wyatt
for
my
case
it
could
be.
i
don't
think
there's
any
sound
reason
for
doing
so,
but
in
those
cases,
the
federal
court
must
retain
the
ability
to
stop
them,
and
congress
has
said
with
that
prospective
relief,
to
encourage
that
prospective
relief,
to
make
possible
in
a
case
such
as
mine
where
my
clients
are
poor,
we
are
providing
1988
attorney
fees.
accordingly,
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
