mr.
baliles,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
was
the
judgment
secured
against
the
commonwealth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
fees,
for
fees,
the
fee
judgment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
trying
to
clarify
what
justice
stevens
suggested
that
the
statute
requires
that
the
commonwealth
pay,
but
there
is
no
judgment
here
against
the
commonwealth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
narrow
question
we
are
confronted
with
is
whether
or
not
there
can
be
a
fee
against
the
individual
judicial
officer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
ms.
wyatt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
you
are
correct,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
tell
the
state
of
virginia
or
commonwealth
of
virginia
to
pay
some
fees,
how
would
that
be
enforced?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
the
attorney
general's
point
that
judges
might
be
just
as
apprehensive
or
nearly
as
apprehensive
about
the
prospect
of
attorneys'
fees
being
awarded
against
them
as
damages,
have
you
given
any
thought
to
the
fact
that
in
quite
a
number
of
cases,
under
1988,
judges,
including
federal
judges,
have
awarded
costs
against
the
nonprevailing
party,
and
the
judge,
if
he
has
been
doing
his
homework,
would
note
that
even
if
he
won
the
case,
in
a
situation
like
yours,
he
might
be
charged
with
some
attorneys'
fees
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff
had
done
something
useful?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
