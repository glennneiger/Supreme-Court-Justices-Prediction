justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
also
apply
to
mandamus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
that
a
judge
could
award
attorneys'
fees
for
a
mandamus
against
a
state
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
authority
against
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
mandamus
actually
wasn't
a
civil
rights
action
but
just
mandamus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can't
get
attorneys'
fees.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
know
of
any
against
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
costs,
$300
some
in
costs
were
assessed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
out
of
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
petitioner
at
any
time
waive
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
your...
the
judge
at
any
time
waive
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
at
any
place
"waive"
the
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
answer
to
my
question
is
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
she
ever
say
"waive"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
statutory,
in
the
congress
that
says
that
we
are
waiving
immunity
for
all
judicial
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
sued
this
petitioner
here
for
$7,300,
would
that
stand
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
care
for
any,
just
damages
of
$7,300.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
have
been
able
to
maintain
that
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
can
maintain
a
suit
for
$7,300
in
attorneys'
fees.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
are
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
now
you
will
tell
me
the
difference
between
the
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
answers
my
question,
really?
justice
thurgood
marshall
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
want
our
ruling
to
be
limited
to
judges
who
do
things
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
so?
