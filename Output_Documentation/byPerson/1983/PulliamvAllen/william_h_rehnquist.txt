justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
baliles,
you
said
this
court
has
barred
attorneys'
fees.
you
mean
to
say
this
court
has
barred
damages,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
baliles,
what
do
you
make
of
the
reference
to
the
house
report
relied
on
by
the
fourth
circuit
that
is
contained
at
page
30
and
31
of
the
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
wyatt,
is
the
citation
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
that
provision
two
sentences
from
the
house
one,
is
that
as
substantial
a
thing
as
there
is
in
the
legislative
report
indicating
that
the
judges
should
be
liable
for
prospective
relief
and
attorneys'
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
is
that
as
persuasive
as
any
other
item
of
the
many
that
you
feel
are
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about,
take
tenney
v.
brandhove,
the
legislative
immunity.
now,
there
you
have
immunity
from
equitable
as
well
as
damage
relief,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
do
you
think
that
nonetheless,
if
this
paragraph
that
the
court
of
appeals
made,
should
be
read
to
allow
attorneys'
fees
against
legislators?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
senator
tenney
was
certainly
a
defendant
in
a...
senator
tenney,
the
original
party
in
tenney
v.
brandhove,
was
certainly
a
defendant
in
a
1983
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
he
could...
attorneys'
fees
could
be
recovered
even
though
neither
prospective
equitable
relief
nor
damages
could
be
had
against
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
we
have
never
decided
that,
have
we,
whether
judges
are
or
are
not
immune
from
prospective
relief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
violate
the
anti-injunction
act,
you
don't
have
to
sue
the
judge.
you
sue
the
party
that
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
state
court
ruling.
