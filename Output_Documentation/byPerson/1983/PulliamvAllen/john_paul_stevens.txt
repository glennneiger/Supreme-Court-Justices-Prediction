isn't
there
this
possible
difference?
is
it
not
correct
that
under
1988,
doesn't
the
statute
expressly
provide
that
the
public
body
shall
pay
the
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
damages
have
to
be
paid
by
the
judge
himself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
would
be
a
factor
to
me
if
i
was
sued,
i'll
tell
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
said
it
would
be
a
big
factor
to
me
if
i
was
the
defendant.
if
i
knew
i
didn't
have
to
pay,
i
might
not
be
quite
as
concerned.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the...
but
with
respect
to
damages,
it's
voluntary
on
the
part
of
the
state,
as
i
understand.
they
don't
have
to
indemnify
the
person
who
may
be
held
liable
for
damages.
but
as
i
understand
the
federal
statute,
they
must
pay
the
fee
if
the
fee
is
awarded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
the
federal
statute
provides
that
the
fee
should
be
collected
from
the
public
agency,
can't...
won't
the
judgment
run
against
the
government
agency
so
he
doesn't
have
to
go
hat
in
hand.
he
takes
the
judgment
and
says
you
people
have
to
pay
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
recollection
must
have
been
incorrect.
is
it
in
the
legislative
history?
doesn't
the
committee
report
say
that
it
shall
be
collected
from
the
public
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
did
i
just
pick
this
out
of
thin
air?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
i
understand
you
to
say
the
immunity
issue
wasn't
raised?
