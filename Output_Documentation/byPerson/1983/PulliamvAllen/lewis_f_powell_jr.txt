justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
do
have
to
assume,
i
suppose,
that
in
some
situations
prospective
relief
will
be
valid.
otherwise
you
never
get
to
the
attorneys'
fee
issue,
do
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
couldn't
we
assume
it
without
deciding
it
since
the
only
question
presented
in
your
petition
is
the
1988
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
wyatt,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
how
long
did
this
injunction
extend?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
indefinite.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
if
this
magistrate
made
this
mistake
again
ten
years
from
now,
she
would
be
guilty
of
contempt.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
that
has
no
influence
on
the
independence
of
the
judiciary,
that
sort
of
situation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
as
this
question
also?
you
sued
this
particular
magistrate
only
in
the
official
capacity.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
you
had
sued
individually
as
well
as
officially
and
the
jury
had,
or
the
judge,
whoever
tried
the
case,
had
brought
in
a
judgment
only
against
the
individual?
who
would
have
paid
those
fees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
view,
there
is
no
situation
in
which
an
individual
judge
would
be
required
to
pay
fees?
suppose
the
legislature
or
the
attorney
general's
office
or
whoever
just
said,
said
we
have
no
authority
under
the
laws
of
virginia
to
pay
anybody's
fees
if
they
have
misbehaved.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
a
federal
judge
could
compel
the
legislature
of
virginia
to
provide
funds?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this
question
also?
we
see
a
good
many
cases
that
involve
no
question
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
attorneys'
fees
but
a
very
long
litigation
as
to
the
correctness
or
reasonableness
of
the
amount.
no
problem
in
this
case,
but
suppose
the
fees
allowed
had
been
$25,000
instead
of
$7500?
what
about
those?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but
my
next
question
is,
who
would
pay
the
lawyers
who
represented
the
petitioner
in
this
case
in
the
long
litigation
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
attorneys'
fees?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
congress
has
decided
that
the
attorneys'
fees
involved
in
a
case
that
is
litigated
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
fees
also
would
have
to
be
paid?
do
you
think
congress
intended
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
supports
your
view?
