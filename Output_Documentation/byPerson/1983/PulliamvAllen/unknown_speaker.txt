the
commonwealth
wasn't
a
party,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
the
commonwealth
did
pay
these
fees?
unknown
speaker
they
filed
a
motion
on
february
11,
1981,
point
d,
defendant
is
immune
from
liability.
doesn't
that
cover
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say
immune
from
liability.
that
is
pretty
broad.
unknown
speaker
i
am
referring
to
appendix
15,
page
15.
they
filed
that
on
february
11,
1981,
a
few
days
after
you
filed
your
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
next
sentence
in
their
memorandum
says
the
injunction
may
be
appropriate
in
some
actions,
but
in
the
case
of
a
judicial
officer,
there
is
a
real
question
whether
it
is
permissible.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
claim
anything
except
prospective
relief.
you
claimed
no
damages,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
1988
that
indicates
anything
about
the
congress'
assumption
about
the
immunity
of
judges
from
prospective
relief?
is
there
any
discussion
of
judges
at
all?
unknown
speaker
judicial
officers?
unknown
speaker
might
they
have
been
talking
about
prosecutors?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
is
there
a
history
of
suing
judges
for
prospective
relief?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
