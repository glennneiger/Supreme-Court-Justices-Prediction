mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
bars
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.
section
1988
against
a
member
of
the
judiciary
acting
in
his
judicial
capacity.
the
facts
of
this
case
arose
in
1980
in
culpeper
county,
virginia.
the
petitioner
is
a
magistrate
for
that
jurisdiction.
the
respondents
were
arrested
in
culpeper
on
misdemeanor
charges
for
which
no
incarceration
was
authorized
by
statute
upon
conviction.
when
the
respondents
were
unable
to
post
bond
after
arrest,
they
were
ordered
by
a
petitioner
to
be
held
in
jail
pending
trial.
respondents
thereafter
challenged
their
pretrial
detention
by
filing
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
a
section
1983
action
against
the
petitioner
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
declared
the
virginia
statues
to
be
unconstitutional
as
applied,
granted
injunctive
relief,
and
ordered
the
petitioner
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
to
the
respondents.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
that
decision
and
held
that
members
of
the
judiciary
are
not
immune
from
suit,
are
not
immune
from
payment
of
attorneys'
fees
in
cases
involving
equitable
or
prospective
relief.
in
this
case,
we
are
seeking
and
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
awards
of
attorneys'
fees
against
judges
are
not
authorized
because,
one,
judicial
immunity
bars
such
an
award,
and
two--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
is
correct.
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
point,
as
i
will
elaborate
in
the
argument.
the
second
point,
justice
white,
is
that
congress
has
not
abrogated
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
in
enacting
section
1988.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
we
would
argue
that
the
injunctive
relief
provisions
are
not
permitted
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
relief,
but
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
the
position
we
maintain
although,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
question
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
question
of
whether
attorneys'
fees
may
be
authorized
and
ordered
to
be
paid
by
the
judge.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
white,
this
court--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--this
court
does
not
have
to
reach--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--this
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
question.
the
injunctive
relief
provision
was
not
appealed
in
this
case
because
of
certain
changes
that
were
made
in
the
statutes
by
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
in
1980
and
1981,
so
that
question
of
injunctive
relief
is
not
before
the
court.
the
remaining
question
is
one
of
the
validity
of
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
which
was
raised,
which
was
preserved
on
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
made
a
part
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
so
the
attorneys'
fees
question
is
really
the
only
issue
brought
to
this
court.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
correct.
if
this
court
holds
that
judges
are
liable
under
1988,
implicit
in
such
a
holding
is
that
prospective
relief
may
be
ordered
against
the
judge.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
correct,
justice
powell.
this
court
can
reach
the
question
of
attorneys'
fees,
the
validity
of
attorneys'
fees
being
awarded
without
determining
the
question
of
whether
prospective
relief
is
proper
when
sought
against
members
of
the
judiciary.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
white,
i
would
not--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
is
one
position
the
court
could
take.
but
this
court
can
take
the
position
that
attorneys'
fees
are
not
permissible
because
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
bars
such
an
award
and
because
congress
has
not
authorized
it,
even
if
this
court
finds
that
prospective
relief
is
appropriate.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
marshall,
in
the
case
of
mandamus
and
writs
of
prohibition,
the
legislature
has
taken
the
position
not
only
in
virginia
but
in
certain
other
states
that
those
are
writs
that
are
rarely
sought,
are
seldom
granted,
and
are
applicable
only
under
very
strict
conditions.
those
provisions,
those
remedies
that
are
available
under
certain
circumstances
would
not
be
applicable
here.
they
do
not
raise
the
same
questions
that
are
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
marshall,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
authority
for
that
proposition.
it
is
not
possible--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--yes,
sir.
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
alyeska
pipeline
case
said
specifically
that
the
american
rule
that
barred
fee
shifting
would
not
permit
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
in
certain
civil
rights
cases
unless
congress
specifically
authorized
such
an
award.
congress
did
that
in
enacting--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
correct.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
authority
for
the
awarding
of
attorneys'
fees
in
that
type
of
action
that
you
have
just
suggested.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
correct.
now,
the
reason
why
we
are
here
asking
the
court
to
rule
that
attorneys'
fees
are
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
this:
this
court
has
said
in
damage
cases
that
judges
are
immune
from
such
liability,
and
it
has
set
forth
certain
policy
reasons.
we
submit
that
those
policy
reasons
apply
with
equal
and
compelling
force
in
barring
attorneys'
fees
to
be
paid
by
judges
because
attorneys'
fees
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
damages.
this
court
has
barred
attorneys'
fees
for
the
policy
reason
that
judges
should
be
free
from
influence
or
the
intimidation
of
monetary
awards
that
may
be
issued
against
their
decision.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
i
stand
corrected.
you
are
correct,
damages.
and
here's--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
is
what
the
language
says,
justice
stevens,
but
that
is
not--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
doesn't
dispose
of
the
problem
here.
the
question
of
who
pays
really
should
not
be
a
factor
in
determining
whether
attorneys'--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
the
suggestion
that
government
or
some
insurance
program
would
pay
a
fee
award
really
is
not
helpful
here.
if
that
were
the
case,
justice
stevens,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem
in
awarding
damages
against
a
judge
because
of
that
source
of
payment.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
stevens,
many
states
have
reimbursement
or
indemnification
statutes.
virginia
does
not.
some
states
qualify
indemnification.
some
attach
qualification.
some
require
review
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor.
the
result
is
there
is
no
certainty,
no
guarantee
that
there
will
be
indemnification
in
that
event.
the
result
is
that
you
face
the
prospect
of
a
judge
going
hat
in
hand
to
a
legislative
body
or
some
other
agency
of
government
seeking
a
special
appropriation,
and
what
that
does
for
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
staggers
the
imagination.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
well,
there
is
nothing,
justice
stevens,
in
section
1988
that
requires
a
state
to
pay.
it
just
simply
says
that
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
award
attorneys'
fees
to
be
paid
to
the
prevailing
party.
and--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--the
judgment
was
against
the
magistrate,
gladys
pulliam.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
yes,
the
fees.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
the
commonwealth
was
not
an
official
party
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
correct.
it
is
against
the--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
stevens,
i
am
not
aware
of
any--
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
--reference
in
the
legislative
history
that
judges
or
some
government
agency
should
pay
attorneys'
fees
awarded
against
a
judge,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
refers
to
the
authority
of
a
judge
to
order
another
judge
to
pay
attorneys'
fees.
it
is
not
mentioned
once
in
the
report,
not
mentioned
by
the
chief
patrons
of
the
legislation,
senator
tunney
in
the
senate,
congressman
drinan
in
the
house;
not
referred
to
by
the
floor
manager,
senator
kennedy
in
the
senate,
congressmen
railsback
and
kastenmeyer
in
the
house.
not
once
was
there
a
reference
even
in
the
house
and
senate
reports
to
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
being
considered
by
the
congress
or
being
repealed
by
either
body.
the
policy
reasons
that
this
court
has
stated
on
asserting
judicial
immunity
applies
to
judges
in
damage
actions,
we
submit
apply
equally
to
actions
against
judges
in
which
attorney's
fees
are
sought,
and
it
is
for
this
reason,
the
consequences
of
monetary
awards
against
the
judges
are
not
lessened
by
the
label
attached
to
them.
a
rose
by
any
other
name
is
still
a
rose,
and
whether
you
call
that
monetary
award
damages
or
attorneys'
fees,
you
still
have
the
same
compelling,
coercive
effect
upon
a
judge
during
the
course
of
judicial
decisionmaking.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
with
respect
to
the
judge?
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
i
would,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
that
is
not
the
issue
before
this
case
although
costs
were
assessed
along
with
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
no,
sir.
costs
as
well
as
attorneys'
fees
are
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
congress
in
this
particular
case,
justice
o'connor,
did
not
deal
with
the
question
of
costs
or
attorneys'
fees
with
respect
to
judges
being
the
subject
of
monetary
awards.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
it
mentions
attorneys'
fees
and
costs
being
available
for
award
by
the
court
in
its
discretion
to
the
prevailing
party,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
record
as
such,
but
the
magistrate
in
this
case
sought
a
special
appropriation
from
the
executive
secretary
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia's
office,
and
it
was
paid.
in
damage
cases
against
judges,
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
essential.
it
is
required
for
the
vitality
of
the
judiciary,
and
it
is
essential
and
necessary
in
order
to
promote
fearless,
principled
decisionmaking.
and
yet
the
purpose
of
immunity
is
not
served
by
protecting
judges
from
damage
actions
and
exposing
them
to
attorneys'
fees
and
awards
in
prospective
relief
cases.
the
financial
impact
of
attorneys'
fees
in
today's
litigation
can
be
just
as
chilling,
just
as
intimidating
as
those
that
may
be
included
in
an
award
for
damages.
now,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
critical
because
if
the
court
sanctions
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
in
this
case,
it
will
have
implicitly
limited
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
approved
the
suing
of
judges
in
prospective
relief
cases
and
subjecting
them
to
the
payment
of
attorneys'
fees.
and
the
impact
of
such
a
step
would
be
staggering.
for
example,
this
court
has
said
in
dealing
with
damage
cases
that
judges
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
distraction,
to
the
diversion
from
work
in
order
to
prepare
for
trial,
to
attend
depositions,
to
answer
interrogatories
and
to
otherwise
assist
in
the
preparation
of
a
defense,
but
those
same
types
of
distractions
and
diversions
are
available
and
would
be
required
in
equitable
relief
cases.
equitable
relief
cases
can
have
the
same
chilling
effect
on
judges
as
damage
actions
because
sanctions
inherent
in
the
injunctive
relief
process
also
include
fines
and
imprisonment
which
are
just
as
intimidating
and
pernicious
as
money
damages.
at
the
very
heart
of
the
judicial
immunity
doctrine
is
the
concern
that
there
be
no
chilling
effect
on
independent
judicial
decisionmaking
caused
by
the
threat
of
lawsuits.
but
the
chill
arises
regardless
of
the
type
of
relief
sought
in
a
suit.
the
chill
occurs
not
simply
because
a
judge
may
be
subject
to
some
pecuniary
loss,
but
because
the
threat
of
a
lawsuit
is
intimidating,
and
that
is
not
in
the
interest
of
the
public.
in
short,
what
you
have
is
the
possibility
that
a
judge
would
pull
his
punches
instead
of
exercising
the
independence
of
judgment
required
by
one's
public
responsibilities,
and
that
is
the
threat
to
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system,
regardless
of
whether
the
suit
is
one
for
damages
or
whether
it
is
seeking
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief.
and
if
this
court
sanctions
injunctive
relief
and
declaratory
suits
against
judges,
the
courts
of
this
country
will
be
flooded
with
a
new
wave
of
litigation
brought
against
judicial
officers
all
across
this
country,
and
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
those
cases
would
be
aimed
at
federal
judges
as
well
as
state
jurists.
the
impact
upon
the
calendars
of
the
courts
of
this
country
and
the
quality
of
justice
would
simply
be
staggering.
and
the
court
should
not
allow
those
types
of
awards
of
attorneys
fees
against
judicial
officers
because
of
the
impact
it
would
have
not
only
on
the
operation
of
justice
in
this
country,
but
upon
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
itself.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
another
compelling
reason
why
judges
should
not
be
liable
for
attorneys'
fees
and
subject
to
equitable
relief
cases,
and
that
is
this:
congress
simply
has
not
authorized
it.
the
court
below,
the
fourth
circuit,
declared
that
when
the
1976
civil
rights
attorneys'
fees
award
act
was
passed,
congress
had
intended
to
repeal
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
to
require
judges
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
to
prevailing
parties.
but
the
court
below
was
wrong
because
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
simply
does
not
support
that
conclusion.
this
court
has
said
in
the
case
of
pierson
v.
ray
that
the
standard
to
be
employed
in
determining
whether
congress
has
abrogated
a
well-settled
rule
of
common
law
is
to
determine
whether
congess
made
a
clear
indication
that
it
intended
to
abrogate
that
well-settled
rule
of
common
law.
there
must
be
a
specific
provision.
well,
in
the
pierson
case,
this
court
found
there
was
no
clear
indication
by
congress
when
it
enacted
section
1983,
and
therefore
the
language
in
1983
that
says
every
person
did
not
mean
every
judge.
similarly,
in
the
case
of
tenney
v.
brandhove,
this
court
found
that
when
congress
passed
section
1983,
there
was
no
clear
indication
that
it
intended
to
repeal
the
doctrine
of
legislative
immunity,
and
therefore
the
language
in
1983
that
says
ever
person
did
not
mean
every
legislator.
and
similarly
in
this
case,
if
the
legislative
history
does
not
show
a
clear
indication
by
congress
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
is
abrogated,
then
every
person,
every
judge
should
not
be
subjected
to
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
in
civil
actions
brought
against
them.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
the
legislative
history
when
i
referred
to
the
floor
leaders
and
the
chief
patrons
of
the
legislation.
the
proponents
and
the
opponents
of
section
1988
both
agree
that
that
bill
was
a
limited
and
cautious
step,
creating
no
new
remedy,
overturning
no
prior
practice
or
policy
except
to
provide
the
authority
that
this
court
said
in
the
alyeska
pipeline
case
was
required.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
justice
rehnquist,
the
court
of
appeals
below
referred
to
a
paragraph
containing
two
sentences
and
a
footnote
as
the
basis
for
its
conclusion
that
congress
had
abrogated
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
the
court
below
was
wrong.
the
house
report
doesn't
simply
support
that
conclusion.
indeed,
there
is
no
reference
in
that
report
itself
to
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
it
is
not
found
in
the
senate
report.
in
fact,
what
the
house
passed
was
the
senate
bill,
and
so
the
senate
bill
and
the
senate
report
were
really
before
the
house,
not
the
house
bill
nd
the
house
report.
but
notwithstanding
that,
the
house
report
cited
by
the
court
below
is
an
ambiguous
reference
at
best,
and
this
is
ironic.
that
footnote
referred
to
this
court's
decision
in
pierson
v.
ray
where
the
standard
said
there
must
be
a
clear
indication
by
congress.
so
the
fact
that
that
case
is
cited
in
the
footnote
at
least
should
suggest
that
congress
had
to
be
aware
of
the
standards
set
by
this
court
in
pierson,
that
there
must
be
a
clear
indication,
a
specific
provision,
and
you
won't
find
it
in
that
report.
i
suspect
that
the
reference
to
the
pierson
case
in
that
footnote,
justice
rehnquist,
is
simply
a
reference
to
the
case
because
that
case
also
involved
not
only
judicial
immunity
but
the
qualified
or
good
faith
immunity
of
police
officers
who
were
also
subject
to
that
lawsuit.
in
light
of
the
standards
that
have
been
set
by
this
court
in
the
pierson
case
for
determining
what
congress
intended,
this
court
should
find
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
section
1988
legislation
to
authorize
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
against
a
member
of
the
judiciary
for
acts
undertaken
in
his
judicial
capacity.
now,
there
is
precedent
for
this
court
to
hold
that
the
judicial
immunity
doctrine
embraces
both
damage
cases
and
actions
for
equitable
relief.
this
court
held
that
both
federal
and
state
legislators
are
absolutely
immune
from
civil
actions,
regardless
of
whether
the
actions
are
for
damages
or
whether
they
are
speaking
prospective
relief.
and
here
is
the
interesting
part:
the
policy
reasons
for
legislative
immunity
are
identical
to
the
policy
reasons
for
judicial
immunity.
the
common
law
origins
are
similar,
and
that
is
the
purpose
being
to
protect
the
integrity
and
the
independence
of
the
decision-maker,
to
protect
the
independence
and
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system,
and
to
prevent
the
distraction
of
attention
from
one's
public
responsibility.
and
because
the
policies
underlying
the
doctrines
of
legislative
and
judicial
immunity
are
identical
and
the
common
law
origins
are
similar,
common
sense
would
dictate
that
the
rules
also
should
be
similar.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
the
bottom
line
in
this
case.
if
the
respondents
win,
this
court
will
have
decided
more
than
just
the
question
of
attorneys'
fees.
it
will
have
limited
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
authorized
the
filing
of
lawsuits
against
judges
in
prospective
relief
cases.
but
if
the
petitioner
prevails,
this
court
can
dispose
of
the
1988
attorneys'
fee
issue
without
deciding
the
1983
question
of
whether
judges
can
be
sued
in
prospective
relief
cases,
and
here
is
how.
a,
this
court
can
decide
that
attorneys'
fees
are
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
because
attorneys'
fees
are
the
functional
equivalent
of
damages
and
thus
barred
by
that
doctrine;
and
b,
this
court
can
find
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
abrogate
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
when
it
enacted
section
1988.
and
the
petitioner
thinks
that
this
court
can
and
should
reach
the
larger
issue,
the
broader
question
and
rule
that
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
like
legislative
immunity,
bars
actions,
whether
for
damages
or
for
equitable
relief.
and
so
this
is
what
we
ask
of
this
court,
reverse
the
lower
court's
decision
and
find
the
following:
there
is
no
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
for
section
1988
to
repeal
the
common
law
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
and
to
authorize
attorneys'
fees
to
be
awarded
against
judges
for
actions
taken
in
their
judicial
capacity;
and
two,
attorneys'
fees
against
judges
are
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity.
mr.
gerald
l.
baliles
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
petitioner
waives
rebuttal.
