mr.
paul
s.
ablon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
mr.
kester's
presentation
is
indicative
of
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
terms
of
the
differences
in
the
perception
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
feel
that
a
more
thorough
view
of
the
facts
are
essential
to
see
exactly
what
mr.
calder's
and
mr.
south's
contacts
with
california
were.
first,
mr.
kester
has
referred
to
mr.
calder
as
an
employee
of
the
enquirer.
in
fact,
not
only
was
he
the
editor,
but
he
was
also
the
president
of
the
enquirer
and
the
second
person
in
command.
he
in
deposition
testimony
acknowledged
that
the
was
in
fact
the
person
who
oversaw
the
entire
functioning
of
the
enquirer,
including
its
editorial
function.
so,
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
individual
who
was
just
remotely
related
or
involved
in
the
control
of
the
publication.
additionally,
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
in
the
court
below
makes
it
clear
that
he
also
had
significant
involvement
in
this
particular
article.
so
we
have
combined
in
mr.
calder
both
the
elements
of
a
general
control
of
the
publication
and
at
the
same
time
specific
involvement
in
this
article,
and
that
involvement
included
awareness
of
the
fact
that
mr.
engles
on
behalf
of
himself
and
his
wife
had
denied
the
truthfulness
of
the
publication
prior
to
publication.
he
was
also
the
person
who
had
seen
the
page
proof
of
the
article
before
publication,
the
evaluation
of
the
article
before
publication,
and
in
fact
admitted...
i
am
sorry...
and
in
fact
had...
was
the
person
who
could
have
precluded
the
story
from
being
published.
additionally,
he
was
the
man
who
admitted
specifically
refusing
to
publish
a
retraction
when
a
demand
for
such
a
retraction
was
made
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
mr.
south,
there
is
also,
i
think,
a
disparate
view
of
the
facts
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
the
trial
court,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
mr.
kester,
and
this
is
the
trial
court
that
ruled
against
the
appellees
in
this
case,
stated,
"in
addition,
reporter
south
visited
california
at
least
once
for
purposes
relating
to
the
article.
"
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
reached
that
same
conclusion,
that
there
was
a
pretrial
visit
by
mr.
south
to
california
with
respect
to
this
particular
article,
and
as
mr.
kester
has
conceded,
i
don't
view
whether
in
fact
there
was
such
a
visit
or
whether
there
were
five
telephone
calls
or
15,
and
i
think
we
have
a
dispute
in
the
record
with
respect
to
precisely
how
many
investigative
calls
were
made
by
mr.
south
to
california,
the
point
being
that
the
thrust
of
the
investigation
was
aimed
at
california.
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
were
employees
has
no
bearing
on
the
jurisdictional
question
in
the
facts,
in
the
jurisdictionally
relevant
facts
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
were
this
the
keaton
case,
where
it
had
been
indicated
had
a
great
deal
fewer
jurisdictionally
relevant
contacts,
possibly
the
employee
status
might
have
some
additional
significance.
in
this
matter,
however,
it
is
clear
that
both
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
were
aware
that
the
state
of
largest
circulation
of
the
enquirer
was
california,
in
excess
of
or
approximately
600,000
copies,
and
in
fact
that
the
enquirer
was
a
publication
which
proclaimed
itself
to
be
largest
circulation
of
any
paper
in
america,
and
in
fact,
as
the
record
before
this
court
indicates,
only
6
percent
of
the
national
enquirer's
publication
was
distributed
in
the
state
in
which
it
was
published,
that
is,
in
florida.
so,
california
was
the
largest
state,
and
that
was
known
to
both
mr.
south
and
calder,
and
the
facts
here
are
even
more
compelling.
the
article
dealt
with
a
subject
that
were
known
to
both
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
to
be
residents
of
california,
in
an
industry
that
related
to
california,
and
clearly
injury,
if
it
were
to
occur,
would
be
focused
in
california.
certainly
in
this
case
where
you
are
dealing
with
celebrities
of
some
national
reputation,
a
claim
for
injury
in
many,
if
not
all
other
states
might
be
involved,
but
that
is
not
before
the
court
because
there
was
no
forum
shopping
here.
the
lawsuit
was
basically
filed
in
california,
where
the
plaintiffs
reside.
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
defendants,
it
is
clear
that
both
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
are
joint
tort
feasors.
as
mr.
kester
has
indicated,
it
is
our
belief
that
they
could
be
subject
to
jurisdiction,
and
the
sole
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
appellees
who
resided
in
california
did
nothing
to
bring
this
attack
upon
them
in
that
state
and
nationally
must
now
go
to
another
jurisdiction,
that
is,
florida,
to
sue
two
of
the
primary
participants
in
this
publication.
we
think
that
the
case
of
worldwide
volkswagen
in
fact
supports
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
there
was
certainly
no...
the
foreseeability
of
being
sued
in
california
was
well
known
to
both
mr.
calder
and
mr.
south,
and
in
fact
mr.
calder
had
been
sued
in
other
celebrity
litigation
involving
the
national
enquirer
in
california
and
at
that
point
did
not
even
bother
to
object
to
personal
jurisdiction.
the
intent
here
on
behalf
of
both
mr.
calder
and
mr.
south
were
clearly
to
inflict
wilful
and
malicious
injury
to
the
plaintiff...
i
am
sorry,
to
the
appellee
and
her
husband
in
the
state
of
california,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
restatement,
section
36,
restatement
of
conflicts,
the
effects
doctrine,
would
certainly
be
applicable
and
justified
in
the
context
and
facts
of
this
case
where
you
have
wilful
and
knowing
intentional
conduct
not
only
causing
injury
in
california
but
aimed
and
intended
to
cause
injury
there.
with
respect
to
the
difficulty
of
suit
in
california,
we
would
submit
that
the
added
burden
to
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
to
be
sued
in
california
is
certainly
not
as
great
as
indicated
by
the
appellants.
they
have
in
fact
been
deposed
in
this
matter,
which
would--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--it
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
required
for...
we
cannot
compel
even
a
named
defendant
to
come
from
florida
to
california
for
their
deposition.
we
would
have
had
to
go
to
florida,
which
we
did--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--at
our
expense.
now,
ultimately
those
expenses--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--might
be
taxable,
but
that
would
be
resolved
towards...
to
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
in
addition,
in
addition,
we
feel
that
the
case
of
church
of
scientology
versus
adams
is
extremely
appropriate.
that
is
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
which
weighs
and
balances
the
minimum
contacts
and
jurisdictional
standard
in
the
context
of
a
libel
case,
and
there
the
court
indicated,
and
again,
the
court
indicated
that
the
contacts
would
basically
turn
upon
the
knowing
foreseeability
of
the
defamatory
article
causing
injury
in
a
particular
state,
namely,
the
state
of
california.
it
has
also
been
referred
by
mr.
kester
that
suing
the
individual
defendants
rather
than
the
corporate
entity
allows
them
to
have
a
certain
detachment,
and
it
is
in
fact
that
detachment
that
we
feel
is
appropriate
to
eliminate,
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
court,
the--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
the
only
question
i
have
with
respect
to
the
way
in
which
the
issue
were
posed
was
whether
the
issue
might
be
published
there.
it
seems
to
me
that
where
it
is
known
that
the
article
will
be
published
there,
or
at
least
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
that
will
occur,
i
see
no
reason
why
someone
having
no
direct
contacts
in
terms
of
physical
contacts,
visiting,
telephone
calls,
sending
mail,
or
anything
of
that
nature,
should
not
be
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
i
might
also
add
that
that
response
is
given
considering
the
facts
of
this
case
where
the
article
is
aimed
at
the
particular
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
article,
the
residence
of
the
plaintiffs
of
the
article,
the
knowledge
of
the
extent
and
breadth
of
the
circulation
of
that
article
within
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
i
would
think
so,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
is
directed
in
the
church
of
scientology
case.
that
is
that
one
can
reasonably
anticipate
more
injury
in
the
state
of
residence.
if
there
can
be
said
to
be
a
state
where
one's
reputation
resides,
it
would
certainly
be
primarily
or
at
least
predominantly
within
the
state
of
residency,
and
because
of
california
being
the
state
of
residency,
one
could
also
anticipate
that
the
interest
of
the
readership
will
be
largest
in
the
community
in
which
the
plaintiff
happens
to
reside.
we
think
that
there
are
some
severe
problems
with
this
court's
finding
some
type
of
due
process
insulation
or
guarantee
or
protection
for
employees
of
corporations.
the
fiduciary
shield
doctrine
which
has
been
advocated
by
the
appellants
is
one
that
we
feel
has
very
shaky
both
precedential
and
logical
roots,
and
in
fact
one
can
hardly
consider
or
believe
that
if
mr.
calder
and
mr.
south
were
not
employed
by
the
enquirer
but
somehow
engaged
on
their
own,
and
could
be
held
responsible
for
certain
acts
in
california,
why
should
the
fact
that
merely
because
they
are
employees
of
the
enquirer
they
somehow
be
mystically
insulated
from
jurisdiction?
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
that's
correct
as
a
matter
of
substantive
liability,
and
here
we
are
not...
we
may
not
be
talking
in
terms
of
agency,
because
of
the
element
of
punitive
damages
which
may
be
interjected.
that
is,
the
law
would
be
that
if
in
fact
mr.
south
or
mr.
calder
engaged
in
wrongful
conduct
not
authorized
by
the
enquirer,
it
is
conceivable
that
agency
principle
might
not
apply,
but
certainly
then
the
intentional
wilful
wrongdoing
of
those
individuals
would
equally
subject
them
to
substantive
liability.
i
would
also
pose
to
the
court
the
problem
of
in
effect
utilizing
different
jurisdictional
standards,
and
that
is
really
what
is
advocated
here
by
the
appellants.
they
are
advocating
a
different
jurisdictional
standard
for
the
media
because
of
first
amendment
considerations.
they
are
advocating
a
different
jurisdictional
standard
for
employees
of
corporations
rather
than
the
corporations
themselves.
we
feel
that
the
standard
jurisdictional
analysis
should
be
applied,
and
when
that
application
is
made
in
the
facts
of
this...
in
this
case,
jurisdiction
over
both
mr.
calder
and
mr.
south
is
clear.
the
cases
for
which...
which
are
cited
in
support
of
the
due
process
restriction
on
subjecting
employees
to
jurisdiction
for
acts
they
committed
in
the
course
of
their
corporate
employment
we
feel
are
largely
inapposite.
they
generally
deal
with
the
situation
where
there
is
an
effort
to
impute
jurisdiction
by
the
corporation...
i
am
sorry,
impute
jurisdiction
from
the
corporation
to
the
employee
where
the
employee
cannot
be
shown
to
have
in
fact
had
the
contact
himself,
even
if
it
was
as
an
agent
of
the
corporation
with
the
jurisdiction,
and
under
those
circumstances,
we
have
no
problem
with
at
least
suggesting
that
in
fact
there
may
be
a
more
serious
due
process
problem.
where,
however,
the
jurisdiction
is
premised
upon
the
acts
of
the
individual,
as
is
presented
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
then
it
seems
clear
that
those
acts
should
be
counted
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
over
that
individual.
if
that
individual
is
not
responsible
or
liable
for
whatever
the
wrongdoing
might
be,
then
the
substantive
law
is
sufficiently
adequate
to
ensure
that
they
will
not
be
subjected
to
any
substantive
liability.
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
well,
your
honor,
we
would
certainly--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--if
it
were
printed
in
florida,
and
assuming
that
the
printer
had
no
knowledge
specifically
with
respect--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--i
think
that
is
different,
because
the
printer
does
not
have
a
responsible
part
in
the
publication,
and
certainly
in
the
publication
of
this
particular
article.
furthermore...
and
i
think
with
that
notion
of
responsibility
goes
the
notion
of
some
element
of
knowledge
of
what
is
going
on
and
what
is
going
into
the
article.
certainly--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
same
would
be
applicable,
and
i
think
that
is
covered
under
the
substantive
law.
i
don't
know
that
the
newsstand
man
would
be
responsible
substantively
if
it
could
be
determined
that
in
fact
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
defamatory
contents
of
the
article
or
anything
with
respect
to
this
publication
which
would
suggest
that
articles
contained
in
it
are
frequently
or
regularly
of
a
defamatory
nature.
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
i
think
that
might
be
a
different
situation,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
difference--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--i
think
so.
i
think
if
for
no
other
reason
that
they
are
in
effect
republishing
the
libel,
and
they
are
doing
so
where
they
at
least
have
an
obligation
to
make
sure
that
what
they
are
republishing
meets
the
standards
that
are
set
forth
with
respect
to
libel
and
the
constitutional
parameters.
that
certainly
would
not
be
the
case
with
respect
to
someone
who
has
no
knowledge
with
respect
to
that.
there
has
been
some
reference
in
the
briefs
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
conduct
here
was
intentional,
or
whether
the
conduct
here
was
wilful,
and
that
in
effect
the
appellants...
i'm
sorry,
the
appellees
are
stated
to
have
assumed
and
the
court
is
stated
to
have
assumed
that
there
was
intentional
wrongful
conduct.
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
presented
here,
the
wrongful
conduct
is
made
out
clearly
by
the
facts,
at
least
as
clearly
as
one
could
anticipate
with
the
understanding
that
a
publication
and
its
primary
employees
are
unlikely
to
admit
intentional
wrongdoing
in
the
libel
context,
but
given
that
parameter,
we
have
here
an
article
which
on
its
face
is
at
least
horrendous
and
possibly
worse.
we
have
a
telephone
call
made
by
mr.
south,
and
we
think
that
this
particular
call
may
have
more
jurisdictional
significance
than
the
other
investigatory
calls
which
he
made.
prior
to
publication,
mr.
south
telephoned
the
appellee
and
her
husband,
spoke
with
them
at
their
residence,
spoke
with
mr.
engels
at
his
residence,
and
in
that
telephone
call
read
the
article
to
them
approximately
three
weeks
prior
to
publication.
and
at
least
with
respect
to
that
call,
it
is
our
position
that
it
may
well
be
more
jurisdictionally
significant
insofar
as
the
complaint
herein
alleges
not
only
libel
and
invasion
of
privacy
but
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress,
and
that
call
may
well,
like
the
telephone
call
in
brown
versus
flowers,
the
case
in
which
this
court
denied
cert
last
term,
in
fact
may
have
constituted
the
operative
conduct
with
respect
to
the
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
just
as
a
matter
of
conclusion,
let
me
just
state
that
we
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not...
it
is
important
to
consider
what
this
case
does
not
present.
it
does
not
present
a
question,
as
suggested
by
some
of
the
amicus
briefs,
of
self-employed,
small
authors
of
books
or
local
publications
being...
having
their
employees
subjected
to
jurisdiction.
it
is
not
concerned
with
mere
employees,
that
is,
insignificant
employees
being
subjected
to
jurisdiction,
but
rather
a
president,
an
officer
of
the
corporation,
and
the
person
who
actually
wrote
the
article
and
investigated
the
article.
this
is
not
a
case
dealing
with
a
publication
which
did
not
hit
home
and
in
which
the
publication
and
its
employees
were
not--
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
--your
honor,
i
think
that
case
would
be
distinguishable
because
one
would
have
to
look
at
the
competence
of
the
book.
what
did
that
author
foreseeably
anticipate?
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
i
think
if
that
author
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
publisher
would
sell
it
wherever
he
could,
or
would
sell
it
specifically
to
california,
and
knowing
the
contents
of
that
book,
there
would
be
every
reason
and
certainly
no
unfairness.
mr.
paul
s.
ablon
that
kind
of
a
person
it
would,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
it
deals
with
the
type
of
person
who
could
not
anticipate
that
california
under
worldwide
volkswagen
was
an
appropriate
forum
to
anticipate
being
hailed
into
court.
