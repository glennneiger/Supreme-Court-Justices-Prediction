mr.
john
g.
kester
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
one
you
just
heard,
although
both
involve
personal
jurisdiction.
in
that
case,
the
central
issue,
which
apparently
was
the
one,
the
only
addressed
by
the
courts
below,
was
jurisdiction
over
a
publishing
company.
this
case,
however,
concerns
exclusively
two
individual
corporate
employees.
it
is
not
an
appeal
by
a
publisher.
the
corporate
publisher
here,
the
national
enquirer,
incorporated,
is
a
florida
corporation.
it
consented
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
courts.
it
is
the
publisher's
employees,
who
are
two
residents
of
florida,
who
have
brought
this
appeal
to
this
court.
the
plaintiff
below,
who
is
the
appellee
here,
is
shirley
jones,
a
television
actress.
she
and
her
husband
complained
that
they
were
both
libeled
by
an
article
in
the
national
enquirer
that
said
that
her
husband's
behavior
was
driving
her
to
drink.
later,
her
husband
dropped
his
complaint.
later
still,
ms.
jones
amended
her
complaint
to
say
that
she
complains
now
only
about
two
sentences
in
the
article,
two
sentences
that
said
that
her
drinking
had
occurred
at
her
place
of
work
and
interfered
with
her
work.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
not
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
plaintiffs
sued
the
national
inquirer
in
a
los
angeles
state
court
for
$20
million,
$10
million
compensatory
damages
and
another
$10
million
punitive
damages.
she
also
sued
in
the
same
complaint
john
south,
a
national
enquirer
employee
whose
by-line
was
on
the
story
that
the
enquirer
published,
and
ian
calder,
who
was
the
editor
and
the
president
of
the
national
enquirer,
the
number
two
man
in
its
corporate
organization.
as
i
said,
the
enquirer
consented
to
jurisdiction
in
california.
the
case
has
not
yet
gone
to
trial.
calder
and
south,
who
are
the
appellants
here,
were
served
by
mailing
copies
of
the
complaint
to
them
from
florida
addressed
to
them...
from
california,
however,
addressed
to
them
in
florida.
they
entered
special
appearances
in
california
to
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
california
court.
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county
cited
this
court's
decisions
in
international
shoe
against
washington,
culco
against
superior
court
of
california,
and
worldwide
volkswagen
against
woodson,
along
with
the
first
amendment,
and
held
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
personally
over
these
two
florida
individuals,
and
it
commented
that
really
all
that
they
would
add
to
the
california
suit
would
be
an
opportunity
for
the
plaintiff
to
try
to
collect
additional
punitive
damage
from
them
personally.
ms.
jones
appealed
that
ruling.
the
california
court
of
appeals
sustained
her
position.
it
held
that
these
two
florida
individuals
were
required
to
come
defend
themselves
in
the
california
court.
i
will
discuss
its
reasons
in
more
detail
in
a
moment.
the
court
of
appeal
in
california
said
it
made
this
holding
even
though
it
found,
and
i
quote,
"it
may
not
be
said
that
defendants'
activities
in
california
are
extensive,
wide-ranging,
substantial,
continuous,
or
systematic.
"
the
case
comes
before
this
court
on
appeal
rather
than
certiorari
because
the
two
individuals
challenged
in
the
lower
courts
the
constitutionality
of
california's
long
arm
jurisdiction
statute
as
applied
to
them.
that
statute
is
section
410.10
of
the
california
civil
procedure
code,
and
this
court
has
jurisdiction
under
28
usc
1257.2
and
the
dahnke-walker
milling
company
doctrine.
i
don't
intend
to
address
that
aspect
of
the
case
further
unless
the
court
wishes.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
very
simple
and
straightforward.
it
is
whether
the
editor
and
the
writer
here,
who
never
entered
california
in
connection
with
this
article,
can
be
sued
personally
in
california
nevertheless.
it
is
whether
the
constitution
permits
california
to
assert
jurisdiction
in
a
libel
case
not
just
over--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--yes,
sir?
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
now,
where
the
record
stands
on
that
is
that
there
is
an
uncontradicted
affidavit
from
the
writer
saying
that
he
never
entered
california
in
connection
with
this
story.
he
entered
california
from
time
to
time
in
connection
with
other
stories.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
am
sorry.
if
i
didn't
say
that,
i
meant
to
say
that.
he
did
enter
california
on
other
occasions,
on
other
stories.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
sir,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
made
a
number
of
long
distance
telephone
calls
to
california.
mr.
john
g.
kester
how
many
is...
in
the
record
there
are
four
telephone
calls
to
california
established.
we
would
note
to
the
court
that
we
know
of
at
least
one
more
that
was
subsequently
established.
i
don't
think
the
number
is
important.
it
was
some
number.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
only
contact
in
the
record
was--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no
mail
communications
at
all,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
simply
the
telephone
calls,
plus
the
article
also
could
be
written
from
whatever
materials
were
available
in
florida,
press
clippings,
what
other
information
there
was.
so
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
not
just
over
the
corporate
publisher,
but
over
the
two
florida
employees
who
never
even
entered
florida
in
connection
with
this
story.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
kester
just
over
the
two
individuals.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
sir.
no
contest
by
the
publisher
in
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--the
publisher
circulates
its
newspaper
in
california,
and--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--as
it
does
elsewhere,
and
the
circulation
in
california
is
approximately
proportional
to
the
population
of
california
to
the
population
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
kester
we
think
it
should,
because
it
makes
a
great
practical
difference
in
this
case,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
standard
jurisdictional
analysis
that
this
court
makes
when
personal
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court
is
challenged,
and
the
analysis
that
the
state
courts
themselves
make,
is,
first
of
all,
whether
the
particular
defendant
had
sufficient
minimum
contacts
with
the
state
to
make
jurisdiction
not
unreasonable,
and
then
the
second
step
is,
as
the
international
shoe
case
said,
once
there
are
other
contacts,
you
then
look
at
their
nature
and
quality,
and
see
whether
in
all
the
circumstances
it
is
reasonable
in
that
situation
for
that
state
court
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
because
what
we
say,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
essentially
what
is
practically
at
stake
in
here,
as
was
recognized
by
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county,
is
simply
whether
these
two
individuals
can
be
held
personally
liable
for
additional
punitive
damages
beyond
what
the
plaintiff
might
be
able
to
recover
against
the
publisher.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
solvency
of
the
publisher
here
to
pay
a
judgment.
the
plaintiff
can
obtain,
to
the
extent
libel
provides
an
opportunity
to...
a
libel
action
provides
an
opportunity
to
vindicate
reputation,
the
plaintiff
can
fully
vindicate
her
reputation
in
the
suit
against
the
national
enquirer
if
she
is
able
to,
if
she
is
successful.
mr.
john
g.
kester
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
plaintiff
brought
the
suit
in
los
angeles
county
because
she
thought
that
was
the
best
forum
for
her
to
bring
a
suit
in,
and
she
may
very
well
have
concluded
that
there
were
advantages
to
her
in
naming
a
whole
string
of
defendants
and
not
just
the
real
tort
feasor
if
a
tort
occurred
here,
because
in
libel
the
tort
is
publication,
and
the
only
publication
there
was
made
by
the
publisher.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
could
be
proved
to
be
tort
feasors,
or
they
might
not,
but
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
initial
question
here
is
not
liability.
we
are
talking
about
jurisdiction.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
the
mind
of
any
member
of
the
bar
or
any
judge
that
merely
having
to
defend
the
lawsuit
is
a
substantial
burden.
if
it
were
not,
and
if
the
constitution
didn't
recognize
that,
we
wouldn't
have
all
these
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
saying
due
process
is
denied
when
a
person
is
dragged
across
the
county
into
a
foreign
court
where
there
are
insufficient
contacts
or
it
is
not--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
is
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
the
dilemma
which
the
courts
face
in
any
jurisdiction
case
where
the
plaintiff
wants
to
be
in
one
court
and
the
defendants
want
to
be
in
another,
and
what
we
are
saying,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
we
think
that
the
collective
defendants
in
this
case
have
gone
pretty
far
already.
the
national
enquirer
has
said,
you
want
to
sue
us
in
los
angeles
county.
all
right.
here
we
are.
sue
us.
we
will
defend
ourselves
there.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
would
say,
sir,
that
the
national
enquirer
is
not
incapable
of
graciousness
on
occasion.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
really
don't
think
that
that
is
central
to
the
case
anyway.
i
suppose
that
had
it
appeared
that
there
was
a
very
strong
winning
argument
that
that
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
national
enquirer,
its
attorneys
might
well
have
urged
them
to
make
that
argument.
but
the
point
is,
there
isn't
anything
really
at
stake
here
for
the
plaintiff
against
these
two
individuals
except
the
possibility
that
they
might
be
held
personally
liable
for
punitive
damages
in
addition
to
whatever
all
else
she
sight
recover
in
los
angeles
county.
mr.
john
g.
kester
punitive
damages
probably
could
be
recovered
in
florida.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
it's
a
little
more
than
just
the
question
of
where,
mr.
justice
white,
because
had
the
suit
been
brought
against
them
personally
in
florida,
one
thing
they
would
have
had
would
be
the
advantage
of
a
different
standard
in
florida
law
as
to
what
must
be
shown
to
collect
punitive
damages
than
is
the
case
in
california.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
surely
would
urge
them
strenuously
to
do
so.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
say
that
the
chance
of
getting
florida
to
apply
its
own
law
in
this
case
would
be
pretty
good,
because
florida
just
two
years
ago
said--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
may
be
the
major
factor
for
the
plaintiff,
but
the
major
factor
for
the--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--she
could
file
a
complaint
in
florida
that
would
state
a
cause
of
action
in
florida.
yes,
sir.
but
where
they
are
sued
is
extremely
important
to
these
two
individuals,
obviously.
now,
the
constitutional
provisions
that
bear
on
this,
as
i
said
earlier,
are
three,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
commerce
clause,
and
because
these
are
corporate
employees
of
a
publisher,
the
first
amendment
applies
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
kester
that
is
our
position
as--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--you
have
never
said
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
never--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--if
he
said
that,
i
missed
it,
but
if
he
said
it,
i
commend
his
perspicacity.
mr.
john
g.
kester
oh,
yes,
but
when
we
say
the
first
amendment
is
at
stake
here
to
some
degree,
we
are
not
asking
really
for
any
special
favor
for
the
press,
and
we
are
not
saying
that
the
institutional
press
has
some
rights
that
other
people
don't
have.
it
is
not
that
at
all.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
simply
that
this
court
at
least
since
international
shoe
and
going
through
culco
against
california,
many
other
cases...
worldwide
volkswagen
mentioned
it
in
passing...
has
said
policy
is
something
we
look
at.
after
those
contacts
are
found,
we
weigh
it
all,
we
look
at
the
policy,
and
we
have
got
that
scale
of
justice
there
with
the
two
pans
going
up
and
down,
and
one
of
the
little
brass
weights
that
you
put
on
one
side
is
what
is
this
going
to
do
to
the
first
amendment,
to
the
system
of
free
trade
and
ideas,
as
this
court
said
in
the
red
lion--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--against
these
two
individuals?
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
would
be
sued
at
their
home
residence.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
think
that
the
jurisdiction
there
would
be
so
clear,
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kester
um-hm.
mr.
john
g.
kester
because
one
has
to
look
at
the
effect
on
first
amendment
activity
if
jurisdiction
is
brought
on
very,
very
slender
reeds
against
individuals,
as
i
said
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
kester
in
a
defamation
case,
because
what
you
have
to
consider
is,
what
does
it
do
to
an
individual
when
he
or
she
is
impleaded,
is
brought
into
the
case
as
a
defendant
individually,
held
up,
possibly
liable,
not
just
for
a
share
of
the
compensatory
damages.
let's
assume
that
the
publisher
would
pay
those.
mr.
john
g.
kester
this--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that's
correct,
and
it
would
apply
further
to
the
doctrine
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no,
indeed,
and
in
this
very
case
it
isn't
the
institutional
media
which
is
the
complainer
here.
it
is
individuals.
and
what
the
court--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--one
a
reporter,
one
an
editor.
mr.
john
g.
kester
an
ordinary
citizen
we
would
ask
be
subject
to
the
same
jurisdictional
standards,
and
really
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
is
the
same
thing
that
mr.
grutman
said
in
the
first
argument.
when
you
are
deciding
jurisdiction,
you
look
at
the
contacts
of
each
individual
individually,
what
were
his
contacts,
not
what
were
somebody
else's
contacts.
in
hanson
against
denckla,
in
worldwide
volkswagen,
a
whole
string
of
cases,
this
court
has
always
said,
look
at
the
contacts
of
the
individual,
and
i
would
say
that
for
a
person
to
be
sued
personally
in
a
case
is
a
very
different
feeling
from
knowing
that
your
corporate
employer
is
being
sued.
there
is
a
certain
detachment
about
the
latter.
mr.
john
g.
kester
if
they
had
published
in
california--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--so
a
publication
occurred
in
california,
or
it
was
circulated
there.
i
would
think
that
had
they
been
in
that
position,
then
there
probably
would
be
jurisdiction
over
them,
other
things
being
equal,
but
they
are
not
the
publisher.
mr.
john
g.
kester
the
fact
that
they
are
employees,
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
they
aren't
the
publisher.
they
aren't
the
ones
who
did
it.
john
south
couldn't
control
where
the
enquirer
circulates.
tan
calder,
although
he
is
the
number
two
in
the
organization,
there
is
no
indication
that
he
could
control
it,
either.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
say
consistent
with
my
theory
you
could
have
a
situation
where
a
company
had
an
individual
who
was
in
effect
an
alter
ego.
mr.
john
g.
kester
sure,
collectively,
a
number
of
people
made
decisions,
and
indeed,
the
way
the
company
works,
a
number
of
people
work
on
the
story.
mr.
john
g.
kester
they
are
all
subject
to
suit,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
only
question
is
whether
and
where
they
are
all
subject
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
would
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
i--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--oh,
i
am
sure
that
they
knew
that.
mr.
john
g.
kester
oh,
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
john
g.
kester
well,
the
auto
dealer
in
worldwide
volkswagen,
mr.
justice
white,
the
argument
was
made
to
this
court,
could
have
contemplated
that
it
would
wind
up
in
oklahoma,
but
this
court
said
in
that
opinion
just
the
fact
that
he
knew
it
could
have
wound
up
in
oklahoma
does
not
suffice
in
itself--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--no
doubt.
there
is
no
question
that
they
knew
it.
they
were
members
of
the
corporation.
they,
like
anybody
else
in
the
corporation,
presumably
participated
in
some
way...
the
record
doesn't
show
in
what
way...
in
the
decision
of
where
to
circulate,
but
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--yes,
sir,
and
in
fact--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--of
course,
of
course,
and
what
has
been
going
on
in
this
case
is
that
these
two
individuals
have
been
deposed
at
length,
and
in
fact
the
record
contains
deposition
testimony
from
them.
there
is
no
impediment
to
the
plaintiff
from
that
situation.
what
this
court
has
to
consider
is
that
this
is
a
case
involving
a
publisher,
but
really,
this
is
a
case
involving
a
corporation,
and
it
applies
just
as
much
to
the
riggs
bank,
general
motors,
ibm,
texas
instruments.
how
much
do
the
acts
of
the
corporation--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
think
there
probably,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
a
difference
in
that,
justice
stevens.
i
think
if
they
are
parties,
their
attorneys
would
insist
that
they
be
there.
mr.
john
g.
kester
right.
mr.
john
g.
kester
no,
i
would
think
that
the
trial
in
the
instance
of
john
south,
he
would
be
a
witness,
he
would
be
in
and
out,
but
if
he
is
a
party
in
that
trial,
and
i
am
his
lawyer,
i
want
him
in
the
courtroom
all
the
time.
i
think
there
is
some
difference
here.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
am
not
sure.
it
would
depend
on
how
the
issues
were
framed
and
how
the
trial
went,
but
if
it
is
a
month-long
trial,
possibly
not.
possibly
not.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
sir?
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
would
make
a
difference,
mr.
justice
powell.
again,
there
is--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--because
i
suggest
to
you,
and
i
think
the
opinions
of
this
court
say
the
same
thing,
that
jurisdiction
does
depend
on
practicality
as
much
as
anything
else.
in
the
hatori
case,
judge
weinstein
makes
the
very
point
that
you
make,
and
he
says
in
that
case
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
solvency
of
the
corporation,
and
that
if
it
were
an
insolvent
corporation,
or
if
it
were
a
corporation
that
was
simply
a
shell
for
one
individual,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
but
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
establish
jurisdictional
facts.
there
are
no
jurisdictional
facts
of
that
sort
here,
and
indeed
none
could
be
established.
i
would
like
to
take
one
moment
to
talk
about
forum
non-convenience,
which
justice
o'connor
and
justice
marshall
mentioned
in
the
previous
case.
i
think
there
is
a
case
written
20
some
years
ago
by
judge
friendly
in
which
he
suggested
that
the
first
amendment
certainly
has
a
constitutional
role
in
cases
of
this
sort,
but
he
said,
why
not
turn
forum
non-convenience
into
a
constitutional
doctrine
and
deal
with
it
at
that
point.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
as
a
practical
matter
there
is
a
lot
wrong
with
that
approach,
even
though
logically
it
seems
fine.
in
the
first
place,
forum
non-convenience,
as
the
term
implies,
is
an
inconvenient
forum,
and
jurisdiction
is
more
than
a
matter
of
convenience,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times.
as
a
practical
matter,
to
assert
forum
non-convenience,
you
have
to
come
into
the
court,
you
have
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
then
you
have
to
try
to
convince
the
local
judge
that
he
is
not
a
convenient
person
to
hear
the
case.
that
is
not
a
position
a
lawyer
likes
to
be
in
very
often.
it
is
not
a
persuasion
that
is
very
easy
to
accomplish.
i
would
say
this
is
something
that
simply
is
not
as
a
practical
matter
a
very
good
solution
to
the
case,
particularly
because--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--that
happens,
too,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
not
as
often
as
one
might
like
sometimes.
and
further,
forum
non-convenience
is...
we
have
talked
about
murky
doctrines
and
gray
areas,
but
forum
non-convenience
is
probably
the
murkiest
area
that
exists
in
the
law.
there
are
no
rules
practically
for
it,
and
it
provides
no
certainty.
as
difficult
as
the
jurisdictional
cases
are
to
understand,
and
i
don't
think
they
are
that
difficult,
forum
non--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--right.
i
would
suggest
there
is
no
reason
to
create
another
one.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
g.
kester
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
powell.
with
respect
to
the
effects
argument,
that
was
one
of
the
three
bases
on
which
the
court
of
appeal
relied
for
its
decision
in
this
case.
causing
an
effect
in
a
state
is
a
very
mushy
basis
for
jurisdiction.
it
has
been
applied
in
a
limited
area
of
cases,
mainly
product
liability
cases.
in
product
liability
cases
you
have
a
very
definite
injury.
you
know
whom
it
happened
to,
where
it
happened,
and
it
is
easy
to
measure,
and
you
have
somebody
who
is
essentially
setting
something
forth
in
interstate
commerce
who
knows
that
it
could
cause
harm
some
place
or
who
should
be
forced
to
be
careful
to
ensure
against--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--i
am
saying
that
metaphorically
we
can
say
that
a
libelous
article
is
launched
and
causes
harm,
but
the
harm
is
much
more
difficult
to
define,
and
in
products
liability
cases,
mr.
justice
powell,
we
have
a
different
standard
of
liability
which
matches
the
different
standard
for
jurisdiction.
we
have--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--but
i
would
say
exactly
for
the
two
cases
you
cite,
mr.
justice
powell,
gertz
says
that
you
do
not
have
strict
liability
in
the
first
amendment
area
in
libel
cases,
and
yet
in
products
liability
cases
that
is
exactly
what
you
have
in
the
law
of
most
states,
a
very
high
standard--
mr.
john
g.
kester
--in
most
states,
your
honor,
and
in
the
states
where
those
cases
have
come
up,
cases
which
have
never
been
reviewed
by
this
court,
indeed.
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
for
plaintiff
to
allege,
as
the
plaintiffs
did
here,
that
this
was
intentional,
this
was
malicious,
this
was
harmful,
but
what
this
court
has
always
asked
for
are
jurisdictional
facts,
not
broad
allegations
in
a
complaint.
certainly
this
case
applies,
as
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
a
while
ago,
to
an
author.
the
decision
here
would
apply
to
authors
who
get
sued,
and
i
take
it
mr.
ablon
is
saying,
well,
it
doesn't
apply
to
authors
who
don't
get
sued,
but
every
author
who
gets
sued
is
going
to
be
facing
a
complaint
that
says
he
acted
maliciously,
wilfully,
with
the
intent
to
harm
people,
and
so
on.
if
effect
is
carried
to
that
extreme,
then
all
the
limits
on
jurisdiction
for
individuals
in
libel
cases
are
essentially
eradicated.
i
would
mention
that
this
court
from
at
least
the
time
of
international
shoe
has
also
recognized
that
individuals
are
not
the
same
thing
as
corporations
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
personal
jurisdiction.
when
you
have
got
a
corporation,
you
are
immediately
faced
with
the
question,
where
is
it,
because
nobody
can
see
a
corporation.
it
is
an
incorporeal
presence.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
construct.
an
individual,
you
generally
know
where
he
is,
what
he
is
doing,
and
the
individual
has
some
rights
under
the
constitution
that
corporations
don't
always
enjoy.
mr.
john
g.
kester
i
think
that
we
have
to
do
exactly
what
mr.
grutman
said
and
what
this
court
has
said,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have
to
look,
as
the
court
said
in
hanson
against
denckla,
at
the
contacts
of
each
defendant
individually
and
say
what
were
his
contacts
in
the
case,
and
in
this
case
these
individuals
did
not
have
those
contacts.
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
this
case
even
to
reach
the
first
amendment,
because
this
is
not
a
close
case.
this
case
can
be
decided
under
the
standard
jurisdictional
principles
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
they
have
always
been
applied,
and
what
we
have
here
are
individuals.
i
can't
improve
on
the
language
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
his
dissent
in
the
beloti
case,
which
i--
