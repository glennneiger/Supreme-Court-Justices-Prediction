unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
does
the
record
show
why
the
husband
dismissed
his--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
kester?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
that
the
writer
never
entered
california?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
understand
your
statement
to
have
been
qualified
by
the
phrase,
"in
connection
with
this
story".
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
how
he
wrote
a
story
without
going
to
california
to
get
his
facts?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
was
the
only
contact
by
telephone?
unknown
speaker
no
mail
communication?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
suggestion
is...
we
have
no
issue
here
of
jurisdiction
over
the
corporate
publisher.
unknown
speaker
just
over
these
two
individuals.
unknown
speaker
the
publisher
has
submitted
to
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
all
the
publisher
did
other
than
what
the
writer
did
was
to
send
the
magazines
into--
unknown
speaker
--like
it
does
elsewhere?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
contested
jurisdiction
over
the
publisher?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
one
of
your
arguments,
mr.
kester,
is
that
the
fact
of
the
publisher's
submission
to
jurisdiction
ought
bear
on
whether
or
not
there
is
constitutional
jurisdiction
over
the
individuals?
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
those
against
it,
you
suggest,
is
that
the
publisher
has
consented
to
jurisdiction,
or
submitted,
rather?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that
isn't
really
the
whole
story,
is
it,
mr.
kester?
certainly,
at
least
in
my
day,
it
was
thought
to
be
advantageous
if
you
were
suing
the
railroad
company
for
a
crossing
accident,
you
not
only
sued
the
railroad
company,
you
joined
the
conductor
and
the
engineer,
and
dismissed
them
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
because
you
were
able
to
deal
with
them
much
differently,
in
depositions
and
in
handling
them
on
the
witness
stand
as
adverse
witnesses
if
they
were
named
parties.
and
actually,
all
you
were
doing
that
for
was
to
get
a
judgment
against
the
corporate
defendant.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
defendant
is
the
only
tort
feasor,
presumably
the
plaintiff's
complaint
would
ultimately
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
for
relief.
i
think
the
plaintiff's
hypothesis
is
that
the
two
individuals
are
also
tort
feasors.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course
there
is
an
obverse
side
to
that
here,
too.
if
you
prevail
and
the
plaintiff
actually
wants
to
obtain
punitive
damages
against
these
defendants,
the
plaintiff
will
go
marching
off
to
florida
and
have
to
sue
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
and
she
was
liable
in
california,
where
she
lives.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
much
of
a
concession
was
that
on
the
part
of
the
national
enquirer?
i
mean,
it
circulates
hundreds
of
thousands
of
papers
in
california.
the
plaintiff
lived
there.
you
know,
all
of
the
arguments
that
were
available
to
the
defendant
in
the
preceding
case
as
to
jurisdiction
over
the
corporation
seemed
to
me
to
be
absent
here.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
thought
perhaps
it
could
be
taken
from
your
remark
that
as
an
act
of
kind
of
graciousness
the
national
enquirer
consented
to
be
sued
in
california,
whereas
it
really
could
have
gotten
off
the
hook
very
easily.
it
couldn't
have
gotten
off
the
hook
at
all,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
but
shouldn't
punitive
damages
have
been
recovered
in
florida
for
the
damage
in
california?
unknown
speaker
so
the
harm
inflicted
was
something
the
plaintiffs
could
sue
for
and
recover
from
these
two
people.
it's
just
a
question
of
where?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
florida
would
apply
its
own
punitive
damages--
unknown
speaker
--i
know
you
would
urge
them,
but--
0
[generallaughter.]
of
course
you
would,
unless
they
would
give
more
punitive
damages
than
california.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
the
major
factor
is
just
where,
just
where
the
suit
has
to
be.
unknown
speaker
you
apparently
concede
that
in
one
place
or
another
these
two
people
could
be
sued
in
connection
with
the
damage
to
reputation
in
california.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
first
amendment
considerations
may
argue
again
or
for
jurisdiction?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
said
that?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
justice
stewart
has
suggested
it
once
or
twice.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
recall
his
emphasis
on
the
word
"press"
in
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but
the
first
amendment
consideration
would
entirely
drop
out,
i
take
it,
if
the
suit
was
brought
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
there
would
be
no
first
amendment
barrier
to
suit
there?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is,
there
is
no--
--well,
that
is
the
point,
mr.
kester.
the
jurisdiction
would
be
so
clear,
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
jurisdictional
issue.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
first
amendment
is
an
inhibitor
against
jurisdiction
if
otherwise
it
is
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
in
a
defamation
case?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
this
would
apply
not
only
to
the
media,
this
argument,
but
to
any
citizen
critic,
would
it--
unknown
speaker
--any
individual
not
a
member
of
the
media?
unknown
speaker
so
this
isn't
a
suggestion
which
you
limit
to
first
amendment
press
protection
then,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
are
one
a
reporter
and
one
an
editor.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
just
have
an
ordinary
citizen
who
had
done
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
there
were
no
corporate
employer
here,
but
these
two
people
were
simply
partners
in
circulating
a
newsletter,
and
they
circulated
in
california,
and
they
libeled
somebody?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
put
the
letter
out
in
florida,
and
they
sent
it
all
over
the
country,
just
like--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
that
the
fact
that
they
are
employees
makes
all
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
of
a
publisher.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
particular
individual
in
the
publisher
that
could
be
sued
consistent
with
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
somebody
made
the
decisions
in
this
company.
unknown
speaker
then
aren't
all
of
them
subject
to
suit?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
kester,
your
suggestion
that
these
particular
individuals
couldn't
control
where
the
national
inquirer
went
suggests
that
that
is
a
highly
discriminating
inquiry,
that
perhaps
the
publisher
might
think
it
was
suitable
to
send
to
california,
but
not
to
washington
or
oregon.
i
mean,
publishers
are
interested
in
expanding
their
circulation.
isn't
that
true?
they
want
to
get
as
many
copies
sold
as
they
can
of
a
national
magazine.
unknown
speaker
so
the
idea
that
these
two
individuals
would
somehow
have
balked
at
circulating
it
in
california
if
only
they
had
been
asked
doesn't
make
much
sense.
unknown
speaker
especially
when
they
both
certainly
knew
the
story
concerned
a
california
resident.
unknown
speaker
and
to
say
they
didn't
think
the
enquirer
was
circulated
in
california
is
a--
unknown
speaker
--so
they
contemplated
their
story
would
be
circulated
in
california.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
dealer
made
no
plans
to
send
it
to
oklahoma
in
that
case,
and
here
there
are
intentional
plans
to
circulate
it
in
california,
which
these
two
people
knew
as
well
as
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
would
you
agree
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
corporate
defendant,
that
the
trial
court
could
compel
the
presence
of
the
two
individuals
to
testify
at
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
be
compelled
to
go
to
california?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
practical
matter,
these
two
people
are
going
to
be
sitting
in
the
courtroom
throughout
the
trial,
even
if
they
are
not
parties.
unknown
speaker
and
they
may
not
be
liable
for
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
but
in
terms
of
the
burdens
of
going
and
testifying
and
worrying
about
what
happens
to
their
reputations--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
think
you'd
want
the
author
of
the
story
in
the
courtroom
all
the
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
corporation
had
been
bankrupt,
and
judgment
proof,
would
that
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
whether
the
individuals
could
be
sued
in
california?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it,
from
the
viewpoint
of
jurisdiction
of
the
california
court?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
judges
like
to
get
rid
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
can
think
of
a
few
other
murky
areas.
we
seem
to
encounter
them
every
week.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ablon,
what
position
would
a
typical
california
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county
take
so
far
as
who
should
pay
the
expenses
for
a
florida
defendant's
deposition
being
taken?
would
the
superior
court
require
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
florida
to
take
the
deposition?
unknown
speaker
at
your
expense.
unknown
speaker
are
taxed.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
said...
he
was
stating
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
if
your
corporation
which
employs
you
is
a
party
to
the
suit,
but
you
are
not,
you
have
a
certain
detachment
that
you
lose
when
you
are
named
a
defendant
yourself.
i
don't
think
he
said
that
all
personal...
all
persons
ought
to
have
a
right
to
that.
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
a
malicious
and
intentional
wrongdoer
might
not
be
entitled
to
that
detachment,
that
in
fact
maybe
it
is
the
people
at
the
enquirer,
for
the
enquirer
as
a
corporation
could
not
itself
do
anything
but
for
or
through
the
people
who
work
for
it,
that
in
fact
those
people
not
be
permitted
that
detachment,
that
they
in
fact,
their
wrongful
conduct
be
on
the
line,
so
to
speak,
that
they
be
answerable
for
their
conduct.
it
is
in
fact
mr.
south
and
mr.
calder
and
the
other
employees
of
the
enquirer
who
publish
the
articles
which
may
and
sometimes
do
lead
to
libel
litigation.
it
seems
that
in
terms
of,
again,
considering
the
practicalities
of
the
situation,
that
there
is
very
little
additional
burden
with
respect
to
the
individual
defendants.
they
will
likely
be
represented
by
the
same
counsel.
it
is
very
frequently
the
case
in
libel
litigation
that
there
are
insurance
companies
involved
in
terms
of
providing
counsel
and
at
least
a
certain
degree
of...
a
certain
degree
of
coverage,
at
least
with
respect
to
compensatory
damages.
turning
to
the
first
amendment
considerations,
we
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
add
an
additional
obfuscation
to
the
already
somewhat
confusing
and
at
least
hard
to
articulate
jurisdictional
standards.
the
first
amendment
is
amply
considered
through
these
courts'
prior
precedents
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
its
progeny,
and
the
chill
which
this
litigation
might
cast
upon
individual
employees
was
also
considered.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proper
and
primary
focus
of
whether
or
not
these
employees
should
be
subjected
to
any
chill
if
any
there
be
by
virtue
of
being
subjected
to
suit
in
california
is
determined
by
the
substantive
law
of
whether
or
not
employees
can
in
fact
be
sued
for
libel.
that
law...
we
feel
that
that
has
been
determined.
the
substantive
law
says
they
are
responsible.
why
should
we
now
engraft
upon
standard
jurisdictional
analysis
another
burden
for
purposes
of
evading
jurisdiction?
going
back
for
a
moment
to
the
authority
stated
in
the
restatement,
section
37,
the
effects
test,
we
feel
that
the
effects
test
clearly
is
being
applied
if
this
court
is
going
to
apply
it
in
this
case
to
mr.
calder,
who
we
have
acknowledged
had
no
direct
contacts
in
terms
of
telephone
calls,
visits,
or
anything
else
with
california.
if
this
court
will
apply
that
principle
to
him,
we
feel
it
is
the
clearest
application
of
that
principle,
for
of
the
various
situations
to
which
the
effects
principle
could
be
directed,
that
is
the
one
which...
that
is
the
one
which
basically
has
the
strongest
support
with
respect
to
this
court's
prior
precedents.
there
can
be
no
unfairness
in
subjecting
someone
to
jurisdiction
who
has
intentionally
directed
his
wrongful
conduct
at
a
particular
state.
with
respect
to
the
fiduciary
shield
doctrine,
so
to
speak,
the
appellants
here
are
asking
this
court
to
in
fact
enshrine
that
principle,
a
principle
which
insulates
employees
from
jurisdiction
because
they
are
employees
and
because
acts
which
they
have
committed
in
the
course
of
their
employment
may
in
fact...
excuse
me.
acts
which
they
have
accomplished
in
the
course
of
their
employment
somehow
don't
count
in
terms
of
having
any
jurisdictional
significance.
mr.
ablon,
on
the
effects
test
which
you
ask
us
to
apply,
do
you
think
that
there
would
be
jurisdiction
over
a
writer
who
never
entered
california
at
all
and
made
no
telephone
calls
at
all
based
on
simply
the
foreseeability
that
the
article
might
be
published
there?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
it
has
a
big
article
about
someone
in
california,
you
could
expect
to
sell
more
copies
in
california
when
that...
in
the
issue
in
which
that
article
appears
than
you
might
ordinarily.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
and
i
suppose
this
would
depend
on
the
law
of
california,
ordinarily
an
agent
is
not
insulated
from
personal
liability
because
the
principal
is
liable
for
his
conduct
also.
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
printer,
for
example,
would
be
liable?
or
would
be
subject
to
jurisdiction
in
california?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
was
printed
in
florida.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
knew
exactly
what
was
in
the
magazine,
what
was
in
the
paper.
he
read
it.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
newsstand
man
in
california?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
newspaper
in
california
that
repeated
the
statements
in
the
enquirer?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
a
case
about
the
author
of
a
book
that
he
gets
published,
and
the
publisher
circulates
it
around
the
country?
how
about
the
author?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
a
man
wrote
a...
an
author
wrote
a
book
and
had
these
very
allegations
in
it
that
are
in
this
case,
and
he
sold
it
to
a
publisher,
and
the
publisher
sold
it
wherever
he
could.
unknown
speaker
so
this
case
does
concern
that
kind
of
a
person.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
kester?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kester,
i
assume
you
will
address
the
effects
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
one
who
knowingly
publishes
libel
doesn't
anticipate
harm,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
that
cut
the
other
way?
when
you
come
down
to
the
standard
of
liability
in
a
first
amendment
case,
you
have
new
york
times
and
gertz
that
afford
very
substantial
protection
that
perhaps
isn't
available
in
a
products
liability
case.
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
all
states.
unknown
speaker
when
an
individual,
mr.
kester,
when
individuals
and
a
corporation
with
which
they
have
a
relationship
are
joined
in
the
same
posture
as
defendants,
do
you
think
that
makes
possibly
some
difference
on
how
the
individuals
are
treated?
