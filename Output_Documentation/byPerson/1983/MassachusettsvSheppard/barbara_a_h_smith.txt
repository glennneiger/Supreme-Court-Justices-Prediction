ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
requires
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
evidence
seized
by
police
acting
under
the
authority
of
a
search
warrant
issued
upon
a
finding
of
probable
cause
but
which
is
later
invalidated
because
of
the
technical
error
of
omission
committed
by
the
issuing
judge,
an
error
of
which
the
police
had
no
knowledge,
took
no
advantage
and
which
resulted
in
no
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
ruled
that
suppression
was
required
because
this
court
had
not
yet
recognized
an
exception
to
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
for
an
error
of
this
type.
the
court,
thus,
overruled
the
trial
court's
determination
that
although
the
warrant
was
defective
the
issuing
judge
failing
to
restate
in
the
warrant
the
items
specified
in
the
application
or
to
incorporate
that
affidavit
by
reference,
he
declined
to
exclude
the
evidence
finding
that
the
police
had
acted
properly
in
conducting
their
duties,
that
they
had
acted
upon
probable
cause
and
in
good
faith
thus
presenting
a
factual
situation
in
which
the
exclusion
would
have
no
deterrent
effect.
rather,
the
sole
consequence
of
exclusion
would
be
to
deprive
the
jury
of
the
real
and
probative
evidence,
thus,
impairing
their
fact
finding
function.
i
think
the
factual
situation
in
this
case
is
extremely
important,
and
i
will,
therefore,
elaborate
on
it
in
some
detail.
at
5
a.m.
the
morning
of
may
5,
1979,
a
saturday
morning,
the
badly
burned,
partially
clad
body
of
a
young
woman
was
found
in
a
vacant
lot
in
the
roxbury
district
of
boston.
a
piece
of
wire
was
bound
around
one
leg.
an
autopsy
disclosed
that
the
victim
had
died
of
multiple
skull
fractures.
the
victim
had
been
alive
but
unconscious
when
her
body
was
set
on
fire.
by
midday
the
victim
had
been
identified
and
osborne
sheppard
had
been
identified
as
a
possible
boyfriend.
an
officer
who
knew
sheppard
as
a
gambler
began
to
circulate
through
the
roxbury
area
stopping
at
a
gaming
house
he
knew
sheppard
to
frequent.
sheppard
himself
opened
the
door,
and
after
some
conversation
with
the
police
agreed
to
accompany
them
to
the
police
station.
he
was
given
his
miranda
rights
in
the
car
on
the
way
to
the
station.
he
was
told
that
the
police
were
investigating
the
death
of
sandra
boulware,
and
they
wanted
to
examine
his
relationship
with
ms.
boulware
and
establish
his
whereabouts
on
may
4th
and
5th.
mr.
sheppard
told
the
police
that
he
had
visited
with
the
victim
at
her
home
on
tuesday,
may
1st,
that
they
together
had
taken
a
taxi
cab
back
to
his
home,
stopping
on
the
way
to
purchase
some
marijuana
and
a
bottle
of
amaretto.
he
said
that
the
victim
had
left
him
at
approximately
2
p.m.
on
tuesday.
he
also
stated
that
he
had
been
at
the
gaming
house
where
the
police
had
found
him
from
9
p.m.
on
friday
until
5
a.m.
that
saturday
morning.
after
naming
some
other
individuals
who
had
been
at
the
gaming
house
with
him,
he
left
the
police
station.
continuing
their
investigation
that
afternoon
the
police
questioned
the
other
members
of
the
gaming
establishment
who
said
that
indeed
osborne
sheppard
had
left.
he
had
left
at
approximately
3
a.m.
borrowing
a
car
to
drive
some
men
home
on
a
trip
that
ordinarily
took
15
minutes
although
he
did
not
return
until
4:45
a.m.
and
then
abruptly
left
again.
the
police
also
learned
that
on
leaving
the
gaming
house
at
6
a.m.
one
of
the
occupants
noticed
on
the
porch
a
gasoline
can
and
a
pair
of
gloves.
on
sunday
morning,
the
police
learned
from
a
friend
of
sheppards
that
he
had
refinished
his
basement
area,
and
this
was
an
area
in
which
he
entertained
women
for
social
purposes.
most
importantly
on
that
sunday
morning
the
owner
of
the
automobile
corroborated
the
fact
that
sheppard
had
borrowed
his
car.
on
inspection
of
the
car
the
police
and
a
police
chemist
found
human
blood
stains
and
pieces
of
hair
on
the
rear
bumper
near
the
trunk
area.
in
the
trunk
area
they
found
more
human
blood
stains
and
pieces
of
wire
similar
to
that
which
had
been
found
on
the
body.
the
owner
of
the
car
told
them
that
there
was
no
wire
and
no
blood
in
the
trunk
of
that
car
on
friday
night
before
he
had
loaned
it
to
sheppard.
it
was
then
after
consultation
with
the
district
attorney's
office
determined
that
arrest
and
search
warrants
should
be
obtained.
a
detective
o'malley
typed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
demonstrating
probable
cause
for
the
search
and
the
seizure.
he
specifically
enumerated
in
his
application
describing
the
condition
of
the
body
that
had
been
beaten
and
burned,
that
sheppard
had
been
the
last
person
known
to
have
seen
the
victim,
that
he
and
the
victim
had
gone
to
42
deckard
street,
that
sheppard
had
been
in
possession
of
a
particular
automobile,
which
was
found
to
have
blood
stains
and
human
hair
on
it
that
had
not
been
there
prior
to
sheppard's
using
the
car.
he
reiterated
that
a
friend
had
told
them
that
sheppard
used
his
basement
area
for
entertaining
women
and
o'malley,
therefore,
specified
the
areas
to
be
searched
as
the
second
floor
and
second
area
controlled
by
sheppard
at
42
deckard
street.
he
specified
the
items
to
be
seized.
probable
cause
for
the
seizure
of
each
item
was
related
to
the
facts
as
set
out
in
the
affidavit.
the
items
included
the
fifth
of
amaretto,
two
nickel
bags
of
marijuana,
possessions
of
sandra
boulware,
wire
matching
that
found
on
the
body
or
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
men's
or
women's
clothing
having
blood
or
gasoline
stains,
blunt
instruments,
which
may
have
been
used
to
inflict
the
multiple
fractures,
and
items
with
the
victim's
fingerprints.
it
was
then
sunday
afternoon
and
o'malley
was
unable
to
find
a
proper
warrant
form.
the
roxbury
court
was
closed.
efforts
to
contact
the
clerks
were
unsuccessful.
efforts
to
find
a
proper
warrant
form
at
other
police
stations
was
also
unsuccessful.
o'malley
did
find
a
warrant
form
used
by
the
dorchester
district
court
for
searches
for
controlled
substances,
which
he
attempted
to
adapt.
he
crossed
out
the
words
42
deckard
street,
second
floor
and
basement
as
the
places
to
be
searched.
he
did
not
at
that
time
delete
the
reference
to
controlled
substance
in
the
portion
of
the
form
constituting
the
application
which,
when
signed,
would
constitute
the
warrant
itself.
the
trial
court
found,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
that
all
of
the
items
listed
in
the
affidavit
were
small
and
susceptible
of
easy
destruction
and
transport
and
were
located
in
a
place
to
which
the
defendant
had
total
right
of
access.
the
defendant
was
at
liberty,
and
he
was
known
to
spend
his
evenings
with
the
occupants
of
the
gaming
house
that
had
given
the
information
about
the
car.
therefore,
it
was
essential
that
the
police
move
with
great
dispatch,
and
they
did.
arrangements
were
made
to
meet
with
the
judge
at
his
home.
o'malley
accompanied
by
other
investigating
officers
and
an
assistant
district
attorney
went
there
at
approximately
2:45
p.m.--
the
judge
took
o'malley's
oath
and
signed
the
affidavit
to
that
effect.
the
trial
judge
found
as
fact
that
the
judge
had
concluded
upon
the
affidavit
that
probable
cause
existed
to
search
the
premises
and
for
the
items
listed.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
the
affidavit.
o'malley
explained
the
problem
to
the
judge
about
the
warrant
form
that
he
had.
he
showed
the
judge
the
controlled
substance
form,
and
the
judge
then
attempted
to
search
his
library
for
a
proper
form.
he
was
unable
to
find
one,
and
he
took
the
form
from
o'malley
assuring
him
that
he
would
make
the
necessary
changes.
he
did
make
some
minor
alterations
as
to
the
name
of
the
judicial
district
and
the
judge.
he
signed--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--yes,
he
was
a
real
judge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
the
position
in
massachusetts.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
we
would
not
be
here.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
proper
form
has
a
space
in
which
you
fill
in
the
items
listed
in
the
affidavit
or
make
a
simple
notation,
"see
affidavit
incorporated
or
attached
herein.
"
and
then
staple
the
affidavit
to
the
form.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
this
form
used
here
has
printed
in
reference
to
controlled
substances
in
the
aspect
of
the
form--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--that
is
right.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
affidavit
was
not
attached.
the
only
correlation
between
the
warrant
that
we
have
is
in
the
affidavit.
marijuana
was
named.
marijuana
is
a
controlled
substance.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
as
far
as
the
items
reflecting
the
specific
items
specified
in
the
affidavit.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
officer
o'malley
could
tell
that
because
he
was
the
one
who
applied
for
it
and
specified
the
items
to
be
searched.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
right.
they
could
only
tell
that
a
search
had
been
authorized
for
controlled
substances
and,
therefore,
the
only
areas
that
could
be
searched
are
areas
that
could
accommodate
controlled
substances,
and
it
was
limited--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--yes,
they
did.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
right.
that
is
all
he
had
to
do.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
would
have
made
a
perfect
warrant,
but
as
the
court
found
through
total
inadvertence
the
judge
failed
to
do
that
in
the
rush.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
he
was
a
judge.
[laughter]
possibly
he
was
too
detached
a
judge
at
this
particular
point.
pardon
me,
your
honor?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
he
was
not.
the
trial
judge
returned
the
warrant
and
the
affidavit
to
o'malley
informing
him,
as
found
by
the
trial
judge,
that
he
had
the
authority
to
carry
out
the
search
as
requested.
the
search
was
then
executed
under
the
direction
of
o'malley.
it
was
limited
in
fact
to
what
o'malley
understood
the
warrant
to
permit.
in
the
bedroom
area
a
bloodstained
boot
was
seized.
in
the
cellar
area
a
bloodstained
scatter
rug,
pieces
of
bloodstained
cement,
women's
earrings,
women's
leotards,
bloodstained
jockey
shorts,
a
hair
piece
that
was
later
identified
as
being
very
similar
to
one
worn
by
the
victim
were
found
as
well
as
a
piece
of
the
wire
similar
to
those
found
on
the
body
and
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
after
the
search
was
completed
o'malley
inventoried
the
items
and
a
return
was
made
to
the
roxbury
district
court
on
monday
morning.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
police
fully
complied
under
urgent
circumstances
with
the
warrant
process.
however,
the
judge
issuing
the
warrant
through
error
and
inadvertence,
as
found
by
the
trial
court
judge,
failed
to
restate
in
the
warrant
the
items
specified
or
to
incorporate
the
affidavit
by
reference--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
believe
they
do,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
once
that
warrant
is
signed--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--your
honor,
i--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--yes.
he
might
have,
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
obligation--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
would
hope
that
he
would
have.
i
mean,
i
think
once
this
was
brought
to
his
attention
he
would
see
the
mistake
that
was
made
and
correct
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
absolutely.
the
police
knew
what
they
had
asked
for.
they
were
assured
that
they
got
what
they
asked
for,
and
they
left
with
both
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant.
i
think
that
the
police
have
no
obligation
to
do
anything
further
than
secure
the
warrant.
i
think
the
constitutional
obligation
stops
there.
in
the
general
case
there
is
simply
nothing
more
they
could
do.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
am
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
in
this
case
they
did
not
read
the
warrant.
they
knew
exactly
what
they
needed
to
get.
they
were
moving
quickly
before
this
evidence
was
destroyed.
they
did
not
read
the
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
right.
i
think
since
the
warrant
is
presumptively
valid
there
really
is
no
obligation
on
the
police
to,
in
a
sense,
second-guess
or
judge
the
judge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes,
your
honor,
and
the--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--not
once
that
is
determined
after
the
fact,
but
the
police
do
not
wait
until
another
court
has
reviewed
the
warrant.
they
have
the
warrant
as
issued
by
the
judge,
and
what
i
am
suggesting--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--affidavit.
that
is
why
it
is
defective.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
thought
it
did
absolutely.
there
can
be
no
question
of
that.
they
were
very
specific
in
their
affidavit,
and
that
is
why,
we
submit--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--no,
they
did
not.
they
did
no
show
the
person
either
the
warrant
or
the
affidavit.
they
did
not
ask
to
see
it.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
do
not
think
it
really
has
any
weight.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
in
which
the
police
from
any
objective
analysis
acted
in
reasonable
good
faith
reliance
upon
a
judicially
issued
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
had
authority
to
enter
these
premises.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
the
authority
in
the
warrant
placed
them
on
the
premises.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
if
someone
had
asked
to
see
it.
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
obligation
that
they
go
in
holding
the
warrant
out.
they
say
we
have
a
warrant.
we
are
here
to
search
this
particular
area.
the
mother
and,
i
believe,
sister
who
were
present
had
no
problem.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
would
imagine
police
officers
would
not
go
on
a
search
without
a
weapon.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
did
they
have
drawn
weapons,
i
would
say
no.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
even
speculation
that
they
were
admitted
because
they
were
waiving
weapons
at
the
people.
they
went
in
peacefully.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
have
a
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
they
said,
we
have
a
warrant,
which
in
fact
is
true,
and
that
was
enough
for
the
people
on
the
premises.
there
was
no
question
raised
by
the
people
on
the
premises.
there
were
no
threats,
no
need
for
threats.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
did
the
police
say
the
had
a
presumptively
valid
warrant?
no,
i
would
doubt
that,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
we
have
a
warrant,
which
they
had,
which
was
later,
later
determined
to
be
found
defective
because
of
the
omission
by
the
issuing
judge.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
think
the
normal
practice
would
be
for
the
police
to
go
on
the
premises,
say,
"we
have
a
warrant
to
search
the
particular
area.
"
if
a
request
is
made,
"i
want
to
see
the
warrant.
"
then
they
should
show
the
warrant.
there
was
no
request
made.

i
cannot
give
you
an
absolute
blanket
answer
to
a
question
like
that,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
limited
to
examination
of
the
totality
of
all
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
officers'
obtaining
and
executing
the
warrant.
i
think
in
this
instance
under
an
objective
test
the
officers
acted
in
a
reasonable
manner
in
executing
the
warrant
they
had
obtained.
they
established
probable
cause.
they
listed
the
items
specifically
in
their
affidavit.
they
presented
them
to
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
who
made
a
determination
that
probable
cause
existed
to
seize
those
particular
items.
he
took
the
warrant.
he
told
them
that
he
would
adopt
it.
the
trial
judge
found
that
he
told
them
they
had
the
authority
to
do
what
they
had
requested.
he
gave
them
back
the
warrant.
he
gave
them
back
the
affidavit,
and
i
think
under
the
circumstances
the
fact
the
police
did
not
read
the
warrant
does
not
render
their
conduct
objectively
unreasonable.
i
think
when
they
got
that
warrant
there
was
nothing
more
they
could
do.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
in
my
opinion
if
and
only
if
this
court
were
to
extend
its
holding
in
gates
where
the
court
announced
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
for
determining
the
probable
cause
aspect,
if
you
were
to
extend
that
to
determining
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
in
this
instance,
i
think,
yes,
we
would
have
a
reasonable
search
because
the
police
complied
with
the
warrant
process.
the
police
executed
the
search
consistent
with
what
they
authority
they
told
they
had.
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
this
was
easily
destroyed
evidence.
the
defendant
was
going
to
understand
very,
very
shortly
that
his
alibi
had
been,
in
effect,
blown
out
of
the
water,
that
he
had
been
identified
with
a
car
with
human
blood
on
it
and
practically
simultaneously
with
a
body
being
deposited
and
burnt
in
a
vacant
lot,
and
i
think,
yes,
indeed--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--if
the
court
is
going
to
extend
gates
considered
under
a--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--that
is
right.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
absolutely.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
it
is
different.
that
is
why
i
cannot
say
without
the
court
extending
gates
to
this
type
of
situation
that
this
would
be
necessarily
a
reasonable
search
without
the
warrant.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
exactly,
your
honor.
taking
all
the
facts
together
including
the
existence
of
the
warrant
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
i
would
say
it
was
a
reasonable
search.
however,
we
are
talking
here
about
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
police
misconduct,
no
turn
effect
can
be
achieved
by
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
i
think
it
is
also
in
appropriate
to
extend
the
deterrent
rationale
to
judicial
mistakes
given
that
a
judge
is
not
a
proponent
of
either
side.
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
law
enforcement
team.
i
would
suggest
that
appellate
determination
or
identification
of
the
judicial
error
is
sufficient
to
deter
future
conduct.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
we
would.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
well,
the
fourth
amendment
only
precludes
unreasonable
searches
so
if
the
search
is
found
to
be
reasonable
with
or
without
a
warrant--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--i
believe
all
of
the
case
law
says
that
ordinarily.
except
if
you
can
establish
a
specific
exception
a
warrant
is
required
for
the
search
of
a
home,
which
is
why
i
focused
on
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
this
type
of
reasonable
mistake.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
i
do
not
think
that
quite--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
--they
had
the
affidavit.
they
had
gone
through
the
whole
warrant
process.
they
established
probable
cause.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
yes.
that
is
the
size
of
the
whole
error
in
this
case,
and
that
is
one
reason
that
we
would
argue
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
because
it
is
totally
contrary
to
the
idea
of
proportionality,
which
i
think
is
central
to
our
concept
of
justice.
it
deflects
the
truth-finding
process
and
affords
a
windfall
to,
in
this
case,
a
guilty
defendant
of
outrageous
proportions.
it
is
a
remedy
that
is
simply
not
consistent
with
the
degree,
the
extent
or
the
effect
of
the
error
committed
in
this
case.
commonwealth,
therefore,
requests
this
court
to
recognize
an
exception
to
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
where
the
police
act
in
reasonably-based
good
faith,
not
merely
subjective
good
faith
at
all,
in
obtaining
a
warrant.
such
an
exception,
it
is
submitted,
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
concerns
which
gave
rise
to
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
first
instance
for
it
would
have
no
effect
under
dispositions
of
those
cases
involving
warrantless
rummaging
through
a
person's
belongings
or
other
flagrant
violations
as
were
the
case
in
weeks
and
mapp,
nor
would
it
permit
police
falsification
of
the
facts
according
a
finding
of
probable
cause
because
by
definition
that
would
not
be
reasonable
good
faith.
it
would
simply
be
an
explicit
recognition
that
exclusion
of
evidence
at
the
expense
of
the
public
where
police
have
complied
with
the
warrant
process
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner
simply
has
no
legitimate
justifications.
the
exception
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
prior
recent
rulings
of
this
court
which
have
implicitly
recognized
that
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
rule
is
not
effectuated
where
the
police
have
acted
in
a
reasonable
manner.
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
the
exception
would
serve
two
salutory
purposes.
first,
the
exception
will
serve
to
foster
this
court's
stated
preference
for
warranted
searches
so
that
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
is
interposed
between
the
police
and
the
individual.
second,
by
granting
consideration
to
the
extent
and
effect
of
the
error
rather
than
the
mere
fact
of
the
error,
it
will
restore
some
degree
of
proportionality
to
our
criminal
justice
system
and
acknowledge
the
that
truth-finding
function
of
our
system
will
not
be
unreasonably
impaired
by
inflexible
mechanistic
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
thank
you
very
much.
ms.
barbara
a.
h.
smith
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
