--mr.
reinstein,
do
you
not
think
there
may
be
a
point
at
which
you
get...
i
do
not
doubt
the
cases
say
what
you
say
they
say...
but
you
are
getting
away
from
kind
of
fourth
amendment
values
that
are
mandated
by
the
federal
constitution
and
get
into
something
that
is
really
quite
finicky
almost
like
the
law
of
wills
about
misdescription.
do
you
think
that
is
all
fourth
amendment
law
as
well
as,
say,
state
of
massachusetts
law
or
some
other
state
law?
