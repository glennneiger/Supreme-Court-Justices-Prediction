mr.
john
reinstein
the
key,
i
think,
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
words
of
incorporation
whether
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
there
is
an
indication
by
the
magistrate
that
he
or
she
intended
to
adopt
the
language
of
another
document
so
that
if
there
is
sufficient
words
of
description
in
the
warrant
itself
sufficient
to
identify
either
by
saying
"see
attached"
and
the
document
is
attached
or
"see
a
document"
and
describes
the
document
by
date
and
author,
then
i
believe
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
particularity
requirement.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
right.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
do
not
agree
with
miss
smith--
mr.
john
reinstein
--i
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
a
police
officer
may
not
treat
as
presumptively
valid
a
document
which
he
knows--
mr.
john
reinstein
--as
a
general
proposition
that
would
be
true.
mr.
john
reinstein
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
john
reinstein
the
police
officer
in
this
case,
detective
o'malley,
who
knew
from
the
very
outset
what
this
investigation
was
about.
he
knew
that
it
was
a
murder
investigation
and
knew
what
they
were
looking
for.
he
knew
what
he
asked
for
in
his
application
for
a
warrant.
mr.
john
reinstein
no,
not
a
clip
alone.
the
proximity
is
not
enough
to
make
it
sufficient.
there
has
to
be
some
indication
that
the
magistrate
who
reviewed
the
application
actually
adopted
its
language
and
the
scope
of
the
search
which
it
contemplates.
i
suggest
that
a
paper
clip,
a
staple,
or
some
other
mechanical
attachment
is
not
sufficient
to
do
that.
there
has
to
be
words
of
description
and
incorporation.
mr.
john
reinstein
if
the
words
were
"see
affidavit
attached"
and
the
affidavit
were
attached
i
believe
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
would
like
to
respond
at
the
outset
to
the
description
of
some
of
the
facts,
which
counsel
for
the
state
has
described
in
her
presentation.
the
state
says
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
this
search
and
that
the
search
described
in
the
application
was,
in
fact,
authorized
by
the
magistrate.
because
there
is
no
proper
warrant
executed
by
the
magistrate
in
this
case,
something
which
reflects
on
its
face
that
certain
findings
were
made
by
the
magistrate
after
consideration,
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
affidavit,
we
are
forced
to
rely
in
this
case
on
after-the-fact
reconstruction
based
on
a
police
officer's
testimony
approximately
one
year
later
in
the
proceedings
related
to
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
that
evidence
shows
as
follows:
that
the
police
officers
with
the
wrong
warrant
form
in
hand
went
to
the
magistrate's
home
on
a
sunday
afternoon;
that
they
knew
of
the
problems
with
the
warrant
form
at
that
time
and,
in
fact,
they
told
the
magistrate.
they
said,
"we
have
the
wrong
form.
"
"something
will
have
to
be
done
about
this.
"
the
magistrate
locked
at
it,
and
he
acknowledged
that
this
was
the
wrong
form.
he
said
that,
in
the
police
officer's
words,
he
would
adjust
the
warrant.
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
record
about
what
the
magistrate
told
the
police
officers
about
this
changes
in
the
warrant.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
telling
them
what
the
scope
of
their
authority
was
or
that
he
would
grant
full
approval
for
the
search
that
they
had
described
in
the
application.
the
officers
then
took
that
warrant,
and
the
state
concedes
today
that
it
was
never
read.
they
simply
put
it
in
their
pocket
and
went
out
to
execute
it.
now,
let
me
mention
first
the
question
of
exigent
circumstances.
the
police
obtained
the
final
link
of
evidence,
which
they
put
in
their
application
for
the
warrant,
early
on
sunday
morning
in
their
interview
with
the
owner
of
the
car
where
the
blood
was
found
on
the
trunk.
it
was
shortly
after
that
time
that
they
made
a
decision
to
arrest
the
defendant
and
to
seek
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
his
home.
they
made
no
attempt
at
that
time
to
locate
the
defendant
who
was
not
at
that
point
at
his
home.
he
was
at
the
gaming
house
where
they
found
him
the
previous
day.
they
went
to
the
judge's
house
sometime
early
in
the
middle
afternoon
still
not
having,
as
i
understand
it,
made
any
attempt
to
find
out
where
the
defendant
was.
it
was
only
when
they
returned
to
the
district
two
police
station
that
they
discovered
by
asking
one
of
the
witnesses
that
they
had
interviewed
that
morning
where
is
the
defendant.
he
made
a
telephone
call
to
the
gaming
house
and
learned
that
he
was
there.
so
the
police
knew
at
least
from
that
point
on,
at
least
from
the
point
at
which
they
should
have
known
of
the
defects
in
the
warrant
where
the
defendant
was,
that
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
interfere
with
a
search
or
to
tamper
with
any
evidence
they
might
be
seeking.
with
respect
to
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
there
is,
of
course,
nothing
in
the
warrant
which
reflects
a
finding
of
probable
cause
as
to
the
items
which
were
described
in
that
application,
and
all
that
the
motion
judge
found,
the
trial
judge,
found
in
this
case
was...
he
found
as
a
fact
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
that
the
magistrate
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
second
floor
premises
of
the
house
at
42
deckard
street
and
the
playroom,
which
was
in
the
basement.
that
is
obvious
from
the
face
of
the
search
warrant,
which
does
in
the
application
part
of
it
mention
the
premises
at
42
deckard.
it
says
42
deckard,
second
and
basement.
there
is
a
photocopy
of
the
warrant
itself
which
appears
on
page
74a
of
the
record
appendix,
which
appears
as
an
appendix
to
justice
liacos
concurring
opinion
in
the
supreme
judicial
court.
with
respect
to
the
marijuana
and
the
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
for
marijuana,
we
do
not
concede
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
for
marijuana.
the
only
evidence
supporting
the
application
for
the
warrant
on
that
was
a
statement
made
by
the
defendant
on
saturday
that
on
tuesday,
some
five
days
before
the
warrant
was
executed
and
three
to
four
days
before
the
murder
took
place,
that
the
victim
and
the
defendant
had
gone
to
his
house
and
before
going
there
they
had
purchased
some
marijuana.
but
the
defendant
also
told
the
police,
which
is
not
reflected
in
this
affidavit,
that
when
the
victim
had
left
his
house--
mr.
john
reinstein
--the
findings
of
the
trial
court
are
contained--
mr.
john
reinstein
--i
think
that
that
slightly
overstates
the
extent
of
the
findings,
and
in
some
respects
i
think
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
go
well
beyond
the
testimony
that
was
actually
given
in
the
superior
court.
the
only
evidence
about
what
took
place
in
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate
was
the
testimony
of
detective
o'malley
who
based
it
on
his
recollection
of
what
had
happened
a
year
earlier.
the
only
statement
that
he
says
that
the
judge
made
to
them
was
that
after
receiving
the
warrant
that
he
would
adjust
it.
there
were
not
statements
about
findings
of
probable
cause
or
comments
on
the
substance
of
the
application.
all
of
the
rest
of
the
findings
of
both
the
trial
court
and
the
conclusions
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
are
based
on
inferences
drawn
from
those
facts.
mr.
john
reinstein
well,
in
this
instance
the
finding
of
probable
cause
invariably
is
first
made
by
the
magistrate.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
reflect
what
the
magistrate
did
so
that
as
a
result
the
superior
court,
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
now
this
court
are
forced
to
rely
on
this
after-the-fact
reconstruction
of
what
happened.
that
is
what
is
before
the
court.
mr.
john
reinstein
but
the
preliminary
decision
is
made
before
the
fact,
before
the
search
is
actually
carried
out
by
the
magistrate.
that
is
the
function
of
the
warrant
requirement
to
have
that
determination
made
before
there
is
some
intrusion.
mr.
john
reinstein
invariably
that
is
ex
parte.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
certainly
a
possibility.
certainly
if
the--
mr.
john
reinstein
--authorized
a
search.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
intended
to
authorize
the
full
search
for
each
of
the
items
that
were
specified
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
john
reinstein
yes,
we
can
assume
the
judge
looked
at
the
affidavit.
mr.
john
reinstein
we
can
assume
that
the
judge
knew
generally
not
only
what
kind
of
a
search
was
authorized
but
what
it
was
that
the
police
had
found
thus
far.
he
knew
there
was
a
murder
investigation.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
believe
there
are
several
ways
of
looking
at
the
prejudice.
there
is
definite
prejudice.
first--
mr.
john
reinstein
--i
do
not
believe
it
would
have.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
have.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
do
not
think
that
this
is
a
technical
violation.
mr.
john
reinstein
it
was
careless.
mr.
john
reinstein
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
john
reinstein
the
requirement
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
a
warrant
particularly
describe
the
items
to
be
seized
serves
a
number
of
important
functions.
it
is
tied
to
the
requirement
of
probable
cause.
the
magistrate
is
expected
to
find
probably
cause
and
then
to
evidence
that
finding
and
to
give
direction
to
the
police
officers.
the
magistrate
is
expected
to
record
that
in
the
written
warrant
document.
it
serves
several
functions,
none
of
which
were
met
in
this
case.
that
is
why
there
was
some
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
first,
the
warrant
which
was
the
equivalent
of
a
warrant
in
blank
since
it
described
something
completely
different
from
what
was
described
in
the
affidavit.
it
did
not
give
notice
to
the
members
of
the
defendant's
family
who
were
home
when
the
police
came--
mr.
john
reinstein
--the
police
officer
testified
that
it
was
showed
to
them.
mr.
john
reinstein
the
record
does
not
show
whether
anyone
read
it.
detective
o'malley
testified
that
when
he
went
to
the
defendant's
home
he
was
met
by
the
defendant's
sister
and
mother
and
that
he
showed
them
the
warrant.
presumably
they
examined
it
and
read
it.
i
should
add
that--
mr.
john
reinstein
--there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
suggests
they
presumably
read
it.
the
record
says
only
that
it
was
shown
to
them.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
all.
the
second
point
on
the
question
of
prejudice
is
that
although
detective
o'malley
knew
what
he
wanted
to
search
for
the
warrant
did
not
give
specific
direction
to
the
police
officers
who
were
responsible
for
executing
the
search.
i
should
add
that
there
were,
i
believe,
ten
police
officers
who
went
to
the
defendant's
home,
some
of
whom
went
to
the
cellar.
others
went
to
the
second
floor.
i
believe
that
detective
o'malley
went
to
the
cellar
and
led
the
group
that
conducted
the
search
there
and
that
a
number
of
other
police
officers
went
to
the
second
floor
and
were
on
their
own
so
that
while
detective
o'malley
may
have
known
what
it
was
that
he
was
looking
for,
the
rest
of
the
police
officers
and
to
some
extent
detective
o'malley
were
forced
in
conducting
this
search
to
determine
its
limits
by
their
impression,
not
of
what
was
written
in
the
warrant,
but
their
impression
of
what
they
had
asked
for,
what
they
thought
they
had
probable
cause
for
and
their
impression
of
what
the
judge
had
let
them
do,
what
he
had
said,
whether
there
was
some
clear
indication
that
they
could
do
such
and
such
a
search.
mr.
john
reinstein
no,
i
did
not
say
there
was
a
finding.
i
said
that
the
testimony
was.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
correct.
the
record
before
the
court
includes
the
full
testimony
that
was
considered
by
the
trial
judge,
and
i
suggest
that
the
court
is
not
bound
to
accept
a
finding
which
is
not
based
on
any
evidence
at
all
where
the
sole
evidence
is
something
else,
that
the
judge's
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
and
is
not
necessarily
to
be
accepted
by
this
court.
there
is
a
third
reason
why
there
is
if
not
prejudice
to
the
defendant
some
concern
why
a
warrant,
a
written
warrant,
should
be
required
in
every
case,
and
that
is
that
as
in
this
case
we
are
trying
to
determine
several
years
after
this
event
took
place
what
it
was
that
happened.
the
superior
court
had
that
problem,
and
now
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
what
the
judge
said
and
what
the
effect
of
the
judge's
instructions
or
comments
to
the
police
may
be.
that
raises
the
possibility
if
that
is
an
acceptable
procedure
that
in
any
case
where
a
search
warrant
is
challenged
as
being
defective
on
its
face
that
the
police
officers
and
the
prosecution
can
attempt
to
bring
in
additional
evidence
to
go
behind
the
warrant
to
show
that
the
warrant
did
not
mean
what
it
said
and
that
a
search
completely
different
than
the
search
authorized
by
the
warrant
was
in
fact
authorized
by
the
magistrate
who
issued
it.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
agree
that
if
the
search
warrant
had
been
precisely
as
applied
for
then
the
search
that
was
conducted
would
have,
in
fact,
been
fine.
mr.
john
reinstein
there
is
a
second
consideration
in
dealing
with
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
particular
case.
the
formulation
and
the
standard
suggested
by
both
the
state
and
by
the
solicitor
general
as
amicus
in
this
case
and
as
the
petitioner
in
the
leon
case
is
that
the
conduct
of
police
officers
should
be
judged
by
a
standard
of
what
a
reasonably
well-trained
police
officer
would
do.
a
reasonably
well-trained
police
officer
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
should
have
been
expected
to
stop,
to
look
at
the
warrant,
to
read
it
and
to
say,
"this
is
not
the
warrant
that
we
requested.
"
"this
is
a
different
warrant
than
we
requested.
"
and
to
go
back
to
the
magistrate
and
to
get
the
correct
warrant.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
right
so
long
as
there
was
sufficient
description
there
to
incorporate
it.
i
believe
the
fourth
amendment
would
place
some
restriction--
mr.
john
reinstein
--it
is
the
reference
which
is
the
key
point.
it
is
the
intent
to
incorporate.
mr.
john
reinstein
no,
i
do
not
believe
that--
mr.
john
reinstein
--that
is
correct.
that
would
be
the
law
of
massachusetts.
however,--
mr.
john
reinstein
--i
suggest
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
some
appropriate
words
of
description
so
that
it
is
the
clear
intent
of
the
magistrate
to
adopt
the
language
of
the
affidavit.
because
the
police
officers
in
this
case
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
a
warrant
describe
what
it
is
to
be
seized,
because
they
were
put
on
notice
by
that
language
by
the
parallel
language
of
the
state
constitution
and
by
a
state
statute,
which
also
requires
that
search
warrants
describe
what
it
is
that
is
going
to
be
seized,
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
they
had
no
basis
for
knowing.
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
constitutional
scholar.
you
do
not
need
the
advice
of
the
judge
or
of
the
district
attorney's
office
to
read
what
is
quite
explicit
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
reinstein
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
of
good
faith,
and
the
officers
testified
at
several
points
that
they
believed
what
they
were
doing
was
proper.
however,
i
believe
the
trial
court's
finding
is
clearly
limited
to
the
subjective
good
faith
of
the
police
officers,
which
we
do
not
question.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
reasonable
proposition
absent
something
in
the
warrant
executed
by
the
magistrate
which
would
tell
him
that
the
magistrate
had
approved
the
search
which
is
described
in
the
application.
mr.
john
reinstein
they
had
to
read
the
warrant
and--
mr.
john
reinstein
--that
is
right.
they
had
to
rely
on
something
in
writing
from
the
magistrate
and
then
even
if
they
had
read
it,
they
would
have
been
on
notice.
they
cannot
execute
something
which
they
know
of
their
own
personal
knowledge
is
not
valid.
for
example,
if
a
magistrate
issues
an
arrest
warrant
which
authorizes
the
arrest
of
john
doe
and
the
police
know
either
after
the
fact
or
contemporaneously
that
john
doe
is
not
the
person
either
that
they
applied
for
or
that
they
have
later
information
which
tells
them
that
john
doe
is
not
guilty
of
the
offense.
mr.
john
reinstein
it
depends
on
whether
the
error
in
the
warrant
is
in
the
nature
of
an
ambiguity
which--
mr.
john
reinstein
--if
there
is
a
17
black
street
and
an
18
black
street
then
they
cannot
conduct
the
search.
if
there
is
only
one
house
on
black
street
then
the
variance
between
the
affidavit
and
the
warrant
would
probably
not
be
significant.
mr.
john
reinstein
they
should
not
conduct
the
search
in
that
case.
they
are
faced
with
a
contradiction
and
it
should
be
resolved
by
the
magistrate
rather
than
by
the
police.
mr.
john
reinstein
the
underlying
principle
of
all
the
cases
dealing
with
misdescription
and
ambiguity
is
that
there
has
to
be
something
which
permits
the
officers
on
the
scene
to
make
a
reasoned
choice
and
to
understand
that
the
court
made
a
finding
of
probable
cause
and
granted
them
the
authority
to
conduct
the
search.
if
there
is
a
choice
to
be
made--
mr.
john
reinstein
--there
are
some
cases
about
partial
misdescriptions,
but
where,
as
i
understand
it,
the
misdescription
is
misleading--
mr.
john
reinstein
--if
there
is
something
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
which
would
either
mislead
or
makes
the
police
officers
make
a
choice
on
the
scene
and
leaves
doubt
about
the
intention
of
the
magistrate,
then
they
cannot
execute
the
warrant.
mr.
john
reinstein
i
am
glad
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
of
having
to
defend
that
entire
body
of
law
today.
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue,
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
necessarily
requires
pickiness.
but
rejection
of
this
warrant
is
not
being
picky.
this
is
a
warrant
which
is
just
plainly
defective
on
its
face.
mr.
john
reinstein
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that.
mr.
john
reinstein
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
police
officers
deliberately
used
this
warrant
for
some
ulterior
motive.
in
fact,
as
the
state
now
suggests
they
did
not
read
it.
mr.
john
reinstein
and
they
had
attached
the
affidavit.
mr.
john
reinstein
so
that--
mr.
john
reinstein
--that
is
the
substance
of
the
criticism
of
this
warrant.
mr.
john
reinstein
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
