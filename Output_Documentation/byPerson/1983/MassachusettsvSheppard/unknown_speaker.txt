unknown
speaker
listed
where,
in
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
was
this
person,
miss
smith,
a
real
judge?
unknown
speaker
in
massachusetts,
miss
smith,
what
is
the
rule
with
respect
to
the
action
of
a
judicial
officer.
that
is,
the
general
rule
is
that
the
action
of
a
judicial
officer
is
presumptively
valid
and
binding
until
it
is
set
aside
by
some
higher
authority.
unknown
speaker
so
when
this
warrant
was
served,
executed
it
had
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
of
validity.
unknown
speaker
miss
smith,
what
would
have
been,
if
they
had
been
successful,
the
real
form?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
what
is
the
difference
between
it
and
the
one
they
used?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
distinction
between
the
form
actually
used
and
the
real
one?
unknown
speaker
in
the
body
of
the
warrant
those
items
were
not
listed,
the
items
to
be
searched
for
and
seized.
unknown
speaker
nor
was
the
affidavit
attached
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
warrant
really
was
defective?
unknown
speaker
if
you
presented
it
to
the
owner
of
the
premises
to
be
searched
and
he
said,
"what
are
you
searching
for"?
,
you
could
not
tell
that
from
the
examination
of
the
warrant
itself.
unknown
speaker
but
the
owner
of
the
premises
presumably
could
not
tell
what
items
a
search
had
been
authorized
for.
unknown
speaker
miss
smith,
is
it
not
correct
that
when
they
executed
the
warrant
they
had
the
affidavit
with
them?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
have
showed
them
the
affidavit
which
would
then
have
given
them
a
bill
of
particulars.
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
it,
all
that
the
judge
had
to
do
was
simply
in
that
space
that
said
"controlled
substances"
was
strike
it
out
and
put
in
"see
attached
affidavit"?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
made
a
perfect
warrant
then.
unknown
speaker
he
was
a
real
judge.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
going
to
observe
he
was
not
a
member
of
this
court.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
miss
smith,
did
the
police
have
an
obligation
to
execute
the
warrant
as
it's
written?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
in
a
sense
some
kind
of
an
error
that
occurred
when
the
police
did
not
read
it
and
say,
look,
that
is
not
what
is
listed
in
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
if
the
police
had
read
it
at
the
time
the
magistrate
or
judge
could
have
corrected
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
theme
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
have,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you
are
a
policeman
the
chance
that
you
may
feel
who
am
i
to
tell
the
judge
what
form
of
warrant
to
use--
unknown
speaker
--you
think
the
police
have
no
obligation
whatever
to
comply
with
what
is
written
on
the
fact
of
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
if,
as
you
told
us,
the
law
of
massachusetts
is
that
the
warrant
is
presumptively
valid
once
signed
then
it
is
valid
on
the
instant
it
was
served.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
miss
smith,
it
is
presumptively
valid
to
seize
what
the
warrant
says
may
be
seized,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
it
presumptively
valid
to
seize
something
that
is
not
listed
in
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
but
this
warrant
did
not
authorize
them
to
seize
the
matters
listed
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
thought
it
did.
unknown
speaker
did
they
show
the
person
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
what
weight
does
that
have?
unknown
speaker
isn't
one
of
the
base
reasons
for
the
affidavit
to
show
somebody
authority?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
did
they
have?
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
weren't
they
obliged
to
show
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
the
policemen
were
armed?
unknown
speaker
the
policemen
had
weapons?
we
assume
so.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
they
be
admitted
because
of
the
weapon
or
because
of
the
warrant?
how
do
you
know
which
one?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
reason
for
having
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
they
show
it.
unknown
speaker
they
had
a
presumptively
valid
warrant.
they
did
not
say
that,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
said
we
have
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
requirement
by
statute
under
massachusetts
law
that
the
officer
show
the
warrant
without
a
request?
unknown
speaker
but
if
requested
what
would
be
the
normal
practice?
unknown
speaker
under
the
massachusetts
law
they
are
not
required
to
deliver
the
warrant
or
a
copy
of
it?
unknown
speaker
or
to
show
it.
unknown
speaker
miss
smith,
there
is
no
question,
i
guess,
that
the
police
were
acting
with
subjective
good
faith
here.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
a
policeman
acts
with
objective
good
faith
in
executing
a
warrant
to
seize
items
not
mentioned
on
the
face
of
the
warrant?
do
you
think
that
that
generally
would
amount
to
objective
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here?
may
i
for
the
moment
just
put
the
exclusionary
rule
to
one
side.
assume
we
have
got
a
warrant
that
is
defective
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
talked
about.
in
your
opinion
did
the
police
officers
conduct
an
unreasonable
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
right
on
that
that
there
is
a
reasonable
search
here
then
there
is
no
need
to
reach
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
gates
really
dealt
with
what
kind
of
showing
of
probable
cause
is
necessary.
unknown
speaker
here
there
is
admittedly
probable
cause
and
there
is
also
admittedly
a
defect
in
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
the
ultimate
holding
in
gates
was
that
the
warrant
was
okay.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
a
little
bit
different.
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
necessarily
mean
to
say
without
the
warrant.
i
am
just
saying
taking
all
the
facts
together
would
you
say
this
is
a
reasonable
or
an
unreasonable
search?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
in
answering
justice
stevens
i
suppose
if
you
just
said
any
time
an
officer
makes
a
reasonable
mistake
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
it
is
a
reasonable
search.
you
really
arrive
at
the
same
result.
unknown
speaker
except
then
you
hold
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
at
all.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
usually
in
searching
a
house
you
need
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
any
time
it
is
reasonable
for
an
officer
to
believe
that
he
has
complied
with
a
warrant
requirement
there
is
no
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
your
submission
to
justice
stevens.
it
was
a
reasonable
search.
the
officers
reasonably
believed
they
had
a
good
warrant.
unknown
speaker
because
they
had
the
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
the
only
trouble
was
that
the
two
pieces
of
paper
were
not
put
together.
unknown
speaker
but
without
that
cross
reference
the
warrant
would
be
invalid
you
say?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
law
of
massachusetts
gives
presumptive
validity
to
that
warrant?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
presumptively
valid,
the
act
of
a
judge?
unknown
speaker
forget
about
the
police
officer.
is
it
the
law
of
massachusetts
that
the
action
of
a
judge
within
the
scope
of
his
lawful
authority
is
presumptively
valid
until
it
is
set
aside
on
review?
unknown
speaker
so
this
warrant
would
fall
within
that
rule,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
conceded
that
if
a
clip
like
this
or
anything
like
it
had
attached
the
two
together
it
would
be
all
right.
unknown
speaker
if
the
words
were
"see
affidavit
attached"?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
was
just
looking
at
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
at
page
49a
in
the
joint
appendix.
this,
i
believe,
justice
wilkens,
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
describing
the
findings
of
the
trial
court.
he
says
on
the
matter
of
the
search
warrant
he
concluded
that
the
warrant
was
issued
on
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
was
justice
wilkens
simply
mistaken
then
in
making
that
observation?
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
ordinarily
take
a
case
to
review
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
when
the
lower
courts
have
made
a
finding
either
that
there
was
or
was
not.
unknown
speaker
when
you
are
talking
about
probable
cause
you
are
always
talking
about
after-the-fact
reconstruction,
are
you
not?
when
a
search
warrant
is
challenged
in
court
it
is
always
after
it
has
been
executed.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
always
ex
parte,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
doubt,
is
there
really,
that
the
magistrate
if
he
had
noticed
the
error
at
the
time
would
have
corrected
it
and
authorized
the
search
for
the
items
listed
in
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
much
more
than
a
possibility.
you
have
direct
evidence,
do
you
not,
that
he
expressed
his
intention
to
authorize
the
search
for
the
scope
spelled
out
in
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
here
to
argue
about
the
rule
in
shelley's
case
or
something
that
goes
back
to
chittie
in
pleading.
we
have
got
more
important
things
in
mind
in
granting
this
writ,
i
think.
can
we
assume
that
the
judge
looked
at
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
then
he
knew
at
least
what
kind
of
a
search
he
was
authorizing.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
before
you
go
on.
there
is
no
question
of
prejudice
to
your
client
in
this
case,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
a
follow
up
with
this
question.
if
the
affidavit
had
been
attached
to
the
warrant
in
the
way
you
suggested
to
the
chief
justice
would
be
appropriate,
would
the
search
have
been
any
more
extensive
or
different
in
any
respect?
unknown
speaker
you
doubt
that
it
would?
unknown
speaker
so
in
what
way
was
that
prejudice,
actual
prejudice,
apart
from
the
theoretical
argument
that
we
are
addressing
here
today
and
that
is
whether
any
technical
violation
of
the
warrant
procedure
requires
exclusion
of
obviously
probative
evidence?
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
it
was
inadvertent,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
the
judge
deliberately
omitted--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
did
they
ask
to
look
at
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ask?
my
question
was
did
anyone
ask
to
see
the
warrant
and
read
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
find
facts
in
the
findings.
i
did
not
find
any
fact
that
they
presumably
read
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reinstein,
let
me
go
back
just
a
minute.
i
do
not
know
if
this
has
a
great
deal
of
bearing
on
the
case,
but
there
seems
to
be
numerous
kind
of
conflicting
versions
of
the
facts.
now,
i
am
looking
at
page
28a
of
the
record,
which
i
believe
is
the
trial
justice's
findings
of
fact.
on
page
28a
it
says
with
respect
to
the
manner
is
which
the
warrant
was
served,
"the
defendant's
mother
and
sister
were
present
at
the
time.
"
"o'malley
orally
informed
them
of
the
fact
he
had
a
warrant
authorizing
the
search
of
the
second
floor
premises
and
area
occupied
by
the
defendant.
"
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
a
finding
that
the
detective
showed
the
warrant.
did
you
not
say
that
just
a
minute
ago?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
finding
certainly
does
not
support
any
conclusion
that
the
detective
showed
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
you
have
been
advancing
the
familiar
arguments
in
favor
of
the
strict
exclusionary
rule.
we
have
heard
those
before.
i
suppose
the
reasoning
behind
my
initial
question
was
whether
if
the
court
responds
to
the
request
that
it
made
in
this
case
and
in
the
case
that
follows
for
some
relaxing
of
the
strictness
of
the
present
exclusionary
rule,
it
is
relevant
or
irrelevant
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
suffered
personal
prejudice.
i
take
it
your
answer
is
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
such
prejudice,
personal
prejudice.
if
the
search
warrant
had
been
in
perfect
condition,
the
search
would
have
been
the
same.
unknown
speaker
right.
i
would
make
the
same
argument
you
are
making
for
the
strictness
of
the
exclusionary
rule
if
i
had
your
responsibility.
unknown
speaker
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
here
or
made
a
reference,
not
a
finding,
a
reference
to
the
law
of
massachusetts
saying
a
search
warrant
may
be
read
with
the
complaint
where
it
is
attached
to
the
warrant
to
provide
sufficiency
of
the
description
of
the
place
to
be
searched.
that,
i
suppose,
was
the
basis
of
your
response
that
if
these
two
pieces
had
been
put
together
their
problem
would
have
been
solved.
unknown
speaker
absent
a
staple
or
clip
or
a
reference
it
falls?
unknown
speaker
this
statement
of
the
law
of
massachusetts
does
not
say
anything
about
the
reference.
unknown
speaker
a
search
warrant,
said
the
judge,
may
be
read
with
the
complaint,
that
is,
here
the
affidavit,
where
it
is
attached
to
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
he
does
not
say
it
must
be
referred
to.
there
must
be
a
reciprocal
reference.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
submission
then
includes
a
suggestion
that
an
officer
would
be
unreasonable
to
think
that
since
he
had
the
affidavit
in
one
hand
and
the
warrant
in
the
other
that
he
was
authorized
to
search
for
the
items
in
the
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
you
also
would
think
that
the
officer
should
not
have
taken
the
magistrate's
word
for
saying,
"i'm
going
to
do
what
you
asked.
"
they
had
to
read
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
as
it
was
issued
and
not
just
read
the
affidavit.
unknown
speaker
so
if
there
is
an
affidavit
that
asks
for
a
warrant
to
search
a
certain
address
and
the
warrant
comes
cut
and
is
one
number
off...
there
has
been
a
typographical
error...
the
officers
should
have
picked
that
up.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
ambiguous
about
it.
there
is
a
difference
between
17
black
street
and
18
black
street.
unknown
speaker
if
the
affidavit
is
attached
to
the
warrant
and
says
18,
and
the
warrant
on
its
face
says
17,
they
should
not
go
searching?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
cases
against
you
on
that,
i
believe,
are
there
not,
incorrect
address
in
the
affidavit
where
there
really
is
a
place--
unknown
speaker
--but
supposing
you
have
a
case
that
everybody
involved
from
the
magistrate
to
the
officer
to
the
executing
officer
on
down
intended
17
black
street
to
be
searched...
that
is
the
place
where
the
defendant
lives
and
all
the
rest...
and
they
type
in
18
black
street,
which
is
next
door.
they
go
out
and
execute
that
affidavit.
there
is
a
lot
of
cases
saying
that
is
not
a
defective
warrant,
are
there
not?
it
does
not,
in
fact,
authorize
the
search
of
17,
but
does
in
fact
authorize
the
search
of
the
place
that
was
intended
to
be
searched.
maybe
i
am
wrong.
i
thought
there
were
such
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
it
is
the
information
on
the
face
of
the
warrant
that
makes
it
clear
that
they--
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question?
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
of
a
practice
of
police
officers
in
this
jurisdiction
serving
warrants
that
contain
no
specification
of
the
items
to
be
seized?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you
a
little
while
ago
about
good
faith,
and
you
agreed
that
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
i
suppose,
found
good
faith.
there
is
no
evidence
of
willful
omission
of
the
items
to
be
searched,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
