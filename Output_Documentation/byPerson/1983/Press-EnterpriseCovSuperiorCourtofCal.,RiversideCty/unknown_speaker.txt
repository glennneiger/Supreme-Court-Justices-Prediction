unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
not
to
misunderstand
you.
you
said
in
a
capital
case.
your
presentation,
your
submission
is
not
limited
to
capital
cases,
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
can't
actually
do
that
for
you,
can
we,
mr.
ward?
we
can't
announce
how
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
should
be
construed.
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
the
final
authority
on
that.
unknown
speaker
we
could
certainly
say
that
if
it
were
so
construed,
it
would
have
an
impact
on
your
rights,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but
doing
it
only
in
capital
cases?
unknown
speaker
is
that
fairly
typical
in
capital
cases
in
california?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
california
lets
the
lawyers
do
it.
unknown
speaker
neither
of
those
rights
are
in
the
constitution,
are
they,
either
of
them,
the
juror's
right
to
privacy
or
the
public's
right
to
now?
unknown
speaker
did
you
agree
there
is
no
right
to
know
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
might
as
well
sit
down
if
you
agree
with
that.
0
[generallaughter.]
will
you
read
the
passage
that
tells
us
that?
or
cite
it
to
us?
unknown
speaker
you
would
think,
i
gather,
that
your
first
amendment
right
would
be
satisfied
even
if
you
were
excluded
from
the
voir
dire
proceeding
itself
if
a
transcript
of
that
proceeding
were
made
available
to
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
ward,
are
you
going
to
argue
that
there
are
no
circumstances
under
which
there
may
be
closure
of
the
voir
dire?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
suggest
there
be
an
inquiry
into
those
circumstances,
whether
or
not
there
are
such
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
initiated
how?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
notice
to
whom?
to
the
press?
unknown
speaker
in
general,
what
criteria
do
you
have
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
the
notice,
the
substance
of
the
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
who
would
have
the
burden
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
and
by
what
standard
of
proof?
unknown
speaker
clear
and
convincing?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
you
would
argue,
mr.
ward,
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
the
voir
dire
should
be
open.
unknown
speaker
you
do
have
a
problem
that
some
states
don't
take
six
months
to
pick
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
accommodate
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
would
make
no
difference
to
you
whether
it
was
ten
minutes,
a
half
an
hour,
or
six
months?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
can
i
ask
this
question?
i
haven't
read
the
hovey
opinion.
i
have
looked
at
it,
but
it
is
awfully
long--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
don't
pretend
to
have
even
begun
to
have
read
it,
but
if
the
substance
of
what
the
california
supreme
court
suggests,
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
really
know
whether
this
is
true
or
not,
is
that
the
public...
the
conduct
of
the
voir
dire
in
public
and
press
attention
to
the
voir
dire
would
somehow
tend
to
make
the
jury
more
prone
to
impose
the
death
penalty
than
otherwise,
if
that
is
in
essence
what
they
are
saying,
would
that
be
a
valid
reason
for
closure?
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
it
a
step
further.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
they
in
fact
had
so
concluded,
but
say
the
legislature,
let's
say,
had
a
series
of
hearings
on
whether...
what
to
do
about
the
voir
dire
problem.
they
are
too
long.
should
we
close
them
or
not?
and
they
came
up
with
a
statute
that
had
findings
in
it
and
said,
we
are
persuaded
by
everything,
with
all
these
studies
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
on
the
facts,
that
the
public
conduct
of
a
voir
dire
plus
all
the
press
attention
given
to
the
selection
of
a
jury
during
this
period
in
a
capital
case
will
tend
to
make
the
jury
more
willing
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
would
that
be
an
adequate
basis
for
closure?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
don't
think
such
a
showing
has
yet
been
made?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
do
you
think
that
prospective
jurors
do
have
any
rights
concerning
questions
that
may
be
of
a
very
personal
or
private
nature
to
have
the
process
closed
that
have
to
be
considered
by
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
such
as
what
alternatives?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
in
some
systems,
as
you
no
doubt
know,
a
jury
in
a
criminal
case
is
put
in
the
box
and
sworn
within
an
hour,
sometimes
30
minutes,
sometimes
15
minutes.
now,
generally,
that
is
accomplished
by
way
of
rather
comprehensive
questionnaires
filled
out
by
the
jurors
in
advance
which
are
available
to
counsel
on
both
sides,
and
of
course
to
the
court.
would
you
say
that
questionnaire
must
be
available
to
the
press,
since
it
is
in
effect
part
of
the
process
that
is
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
available,
if,
as
you
say,
that
questionnaire
should
be
available
to
the
media,
then
where
is
the
protection
of
the
privacy?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
ward,
whether
the
system
is
of
individual
interrogation
or
of
the
venire
as
a
group,
all
you
are
asking
is
that
the
press
be
allowed
to
be
present.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
can
remember
interrogating
prospective
jurors
in
chambers
with
just
counsel
present,
and
your
suggestion
would
be
there
also
ought
to
be
present
at
least
the
press.
you
can't
very
well
allow
the...
accommodate
to
many
of
the
general
public.
unknown
speaker
inappropriate?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
would
your
supposed
rights
extend
beyond
voir
dire
and
into,
for
example,
the
plea
bargaining
process
between
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saving
that
for
tomorrow?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
to
say
that
globe
controls,
you
have
to
show
that
this
is
really
part
of
the
trial,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
define
trial
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
in
this
case
instead
of
it
being
voir
dire,
it
had
been
a
motion
the
day
before
it
was
set
for
trial
for
a
continuance,
at
which
both
sides
were
going
to
present
witnesses,
and
then
the
trial
judge
felt
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
reason
for
closing
that
because
the
witnesses
might
touch
on
some
sensitive
matters.
now,
would
you
feel
that
under
the
principle
that
would
be
announced
in
the
globe
case
or
in
this
case,
you
could
claim
that
that
was
part
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
a
motion
for
a
continuance
the
day
before
the
jury
was
scheduled
to
be
empaneled
would
also
be
what
you
call
a
"part
of
the
process"?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say,
we
are
not
prepared
to
do
it
at
this
time,
it
is
sort
of
an
unsatisfactory
answer.
what
do
you
really
think
about
it?
it
is
not
whether
you
are
arguing
it
today.
it
is
how
do
you
analyze
it.
unknown
speaker
we
got
into
that
in
gannett,
didn't
we?
unknown
speaker
i
say,
in
the
gannett
case,
we
certainly
got
into
pretrial
material.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
whole
case
could
go
off
just
on
whether
this
is
part
of
the
trial
or
not.
if
this
is
part
of
the
trial,
richmond
governs,
and
if--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
do
submit
it
is
part
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
you,
wouldn't
richmond
control?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
isn't
part
of
the
trial,
then
we
have
to
consider
the
relationship
of
gannett
and
richmond.
unknown
speaker
in
california,
does
the
trial
be
with
the
jury
selection
for
all
purposes,
for
example
double
jeopardy?
when
does
double
jeopardy
begin
under
that
opinion?
unknown
speaker
when
does
jeopardy
attach,
not
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
your
previous
statement
was
that
a
trial
commences
with
the
select
of
the
jury.
it
does
for
these
purposes
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
contention.
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking,
mr.
salter,
about
a
juror's
right
to
privacy
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
united
states
constitution
do
you
think
guarantees
a
juror's
right
to
privacy?
unknown
speaker
and
what
cases
from
this
court
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
could
a
juror
refuse
to
answer
a
judge's
question
on
the
voir
dire
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
violate
his
right
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
a
judge
would...
do
what?
unknown
speaker
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
little
bit,
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it,
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
are
too...
i
am
responsible
for
it,
but
i
think
we
are
too
far
afield,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
have
the
right
of
privacy
not
to
tell
your
husband's
work?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
for
the
right
of
privacy
point.
some
juror
says,
under
my
right
of
privacy,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
question
me.
unknown
speaker
i
would
hate
to
see
somebody
try.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
the
juror's
point
into
this
as
a
first
amendment
right.
i
don't...
it
just--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
we
have
a
case
here
in
this
court
where
a
juror
was
drunk.
could
that
juror
say,
you
can't
question
me
because
it
would
violate
my
right
of
privacy?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
could
he
say,
you
can't
question
me?
don't
you
violate
my
privacy?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
other
than
privacy?
unknown
speaker
he
could
say
privacy,
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
you're
telling
me.
unknown
speaker
justice
rehnquist
asked
you,
where
was
it
in
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you,
where
is
it
any
place?
unknown
speaker
so
how
do
they
decide
that?
or
is
that
why
the
voir
dires
take
six
months
in
california?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if
the
voir
dire
in
this
particular
case
is
in
the
record
before
us?
is
it
available
to
us?
unknown
speaker
have
you
examined
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
didn't
participate
in
the
trial
then?
unknown
speaker
because
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
is
any
way
to
find
out
what
percentage
of
this
massive
inquiry
really
involved
confidential
matters,
or
privacy
matters,
however
you
want
to
describe
them.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
we
are
most
interested
in
the
rest
of
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
entire
off
the
record
voir
dire
or
whatever
it
is
involved
these
matters
that
would
not
normally
be
conducted
in
open
court?
i
had
the
impression
that
maybe
3
or
4
percent
of
the
questions
involved
something
fairly
sensitive,
but
the
rest
of
it
was
fairly
routine.
but
are
you
telling
me
everything
in
this
massive
examination
is
sensitive?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
case
before
this
court
that
we
were
denied
the
right
to
see
what
we
were
passing
upon?
unknown
speaker
including
the
pentagon
papers?
but
we
can't
see
this?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
wish
to
see
it.
i
just
want
to
know
why
it
is--
--why
you
can't.
yes,
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is,
we
can
see
it.
unknown
speaker
was
it
printed
for
the
appeal
to
the
california
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
mr.
salter,
were
there
any
feasible
alternatives
to
a
permanent
sealing
of
that
record?
could
the
actual
sensitive
responses
have
been
deleted,
or
could
numbers
have
been
assigned
so
the
identities
weren't
known?
were
there
any
feasible
alternatives?
and
should
the
court
consider
feasible
alternatives?
unknown
speaker
mr.
salter,
i
am
sorry.
i
perhaps
shouldn't
interrupt
you
again,
but
i
really
am
still...
i
think
maybe
the
chief
justice
is
concerned,
too,
about
the
length
of
this
voir
dire
and
the
significance
of
all
these
questions.
you
said
it
is
all
the
result
of
the
case
of
people
against
williams.
is
that
the
case
that
involved
the
question
of
whether
there
could
be
peremptory
challenges
on
racial
grounds?
and
this
is
the
matter
of
making
a
record
to
explain
why
peremptory
challenges
are
made?
is
it
related
to
that
problem?
unknown
speaker
what
would
otherwise
have
been
just
not...
you
have
to
make
a
record,
in
other
words,
to
justify
peremptory
challenges
if
they
concentrate
on
one
minority
group
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
in
a
capital
case,
how
many
peremptory
challenges
does
each
party
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
at
least
you
could
consider
whether
you
could
delete
the
identification
of
those
responding.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
transcript,
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
unknown
speaker
should
we
not
presume
that
the
citizens
will
tell
the
truth
before
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
understand
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
is
an
argument
you
are
making
in
favor
of
closing
the
voir
dire
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
is
the
reason
for
not
letting
a
newspaper
man
hear
that
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
you
arguing
it
for?
unknown
speaker
are
you
relying
on
it
or
not?
that's
all
i'm
asking.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
were
responding
to
a
question.
unknown
speaker
but
they
allowed
the
questions,
but
they
didn't
allow
the
press
to
sit
in
on
the
questioning,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
that
an
alternative?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
death-qualifying
portion
of
the
questioning
as
envisioned
by
the
hovey
case
in
california
should
require
closure?
unknown
speaker
to
the
press?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
some
of
these
questions
relate
to
the
hovey
requirement
in
the
death-qualifying
portion?
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
any
reason
why
the
transcript
should
be
permanently
sealed
as
to
those
questions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
backtracking,
and
you
are
now
saying
that
that
portion
should
be
closed
if
it
meets
the
hovey
qualification--
unknown
speaker
somewhere
in
these
papers
or
in
the
whole
treatment
in
the
discussion
of
less
burdensome
alternatives
was
the
idea
that
if
a
juror
had
some
confidential
matter
they
wanted
not
to
be
interrogated
about,
they
go
to
the
judge
in
chambers
or
communicate
with
him
and
explain
this
and
then
ask
to
be
excused.
if
that
were
done,
would
you
think
the
media
is
entitled
to
know
the
reason
why
the
judge
excused
the
juror?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
waive
any
inquiry,
any
claim
to
a
right
to
know
what
the
reasons
were?
