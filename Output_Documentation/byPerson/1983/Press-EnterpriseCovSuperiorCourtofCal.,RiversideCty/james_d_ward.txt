mr.
james
d.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
closure
case
involving
specifically
the
issue
of
closure
of
the
voir
dire
proceedings
in
a
capital
case.
the
questions
presented
here
confront
the
court
with
the
rules
involving
access
to
the
courtroom
by
the
public
and
the
press.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
case
below
was
limited--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--to
a
capital
case,
and
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--the
trial
court
was...
and
the
courts
below
have
been
utilizing
the
authority
of
a
case
which
dealt
with
the
interrogation
of
the
jury
in
a
capital
case.
the
problem
has
only
arisen
thus
far
in
capital
cases.
obviously,
we
would
be
happy
with
the
pronouncement
that
affected
the
voir
dire
in
all
sorts
of
criminal
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
in
fact
asking
the
court
to
clarify
that
the
right
of
access
to
establish
that
that
right
of
access
applies
to
the
jury
selection
process
generally.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
pronounce
that
the
california
supreme
court
case
of
hovey
versus
superior
court
should
be
construed
and
applied
consistent
with
the
right
of
access.
mr.
james
d.
ward
justice
rehnquist,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
pronounced
a
rule
in
this
case
as
to
the
method
of
selecting
jurors
in
capital
cases
which
has
been,
in
our
opinion,
misinterpreted
by
the
trial
courts
of
our
state
in
a
way
that
has
impacted
upon
our
constitutional
rights.
it
would
be
our
position
that
this
court
could
most
assuredly
pronounce
that
the
case
should
not
be
interpreted
to
impact
upon
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
believe
we
are
saying
the
same
thing,
justice
rehnquist,
in
a
different...
at
least
i
am
attempting
to
do
so.
the
defendant
in
the
case
below
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
death
in
connection
with
a
rape
and
murder.
during
the
trial,
the
court
closed
the
proceedings
during
six
weeks
of
voir
dire
proceedings.
the
transcript
of
the
six
weeks
of
voir
dire
was
sealed
by
the
court.
three
times
the
petitioner
attempted
to
seek
access
to
the
proceedings.
on
the
first
occasion,
in
october
of
1981,
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
jury
selection
process,
petitioner
made
an
oral
and
written
motion
to
allow
the
public
access
to
the
voir
dire
proceedings.
we
did
so
because
we
had
faced
this
issue
before
in
other
departments
of
the
same
court.
the
courts
in
our
county
and
indeed
in
the
state
of
california
had
been
closing
the
courtroom
during
the
voir
dire
as
a
result
of
the
case
of
hovey
versus
superior
court
handed
down
by
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
james
d.
ward
to
our
knowledge,
the
problem
only
arose
in
capital
cases.
we
have
had
a
reference
to
the
possibility
of
the
use
of
the
same
procedures
in
other
cases,
but
we
have
no
knowledge
of
those
instances,
justice
brennan.
the...
we
contended
then,
as
we
contend
now,
that
the
case
of
hovey
versus
superior
court
did
not
require
closure
in
order
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
this
regard.
we
argued
that
to
the
court
on
october
19th,
1981,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
court
made
some
comments
which
appear
in
the
record
and
in
the
joint
appendix.
those
comments
were
generally
to
the
effect
that
the
court
believed
that
the
general
voir
dire
should
remain
open,
and
that
the
death-qualifying
voir
dire
should
be
closed.
however,
the
court
went
on
thereafter,
after
the
entreaties
of
the
defense
counsel,
to
indicate
that
there
should
be
other
portions
of
the
voir
dire
that
would
possibly
be
closed.
the
court
expanded
its
thoughts
slightly
and
said
that
he
would
conduct
individual
voir
dire
with
regard
to
death
qualification
and
"any
other
special
areas
that
counsel
may
feel
some
problem
with
regard
to.
"
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
regarding
individual
voir
dire,
the
court
"reserved
jurisdiction
to
permit
something
further
than
death
qualification.
"
the
court
then
proceeded
to
the
selection
of
the
jury
as
indicated
with
three
days,
three
days
of
open
voir
dire
and
six
weeks
of
closed
voir
dire.
mr.
james
d.
ward
unfortunately,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
length
of
time
for
selecting
of
juries
has
grown
by
leaps
and
bounds
in
california.
mr.
james
d.
ward
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
counsel's...
respondent's
brief
referred
to
one
case,
a
case
in
which
we
petitioned
for
cert
to
this
court,
involving
selection
of
a
jury
involving
six
months.
that
is
the
most
extensive
one
that
we
know
of.
and
i
might
add
in
that
case
the
voir
dire
in
its
entirety
was
closed,
in
its
entirety.
however,
in
that
case
the
transcript
was
released
following
the
voir
dire
process.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
jury
selection
in
this
case,
petitioner
again
filed
a
written
motion
with
the
court,
this
time
requesting
the
transcript
of
the
closed
proceeding.
at
the
hearing,
the
court
admitted
that
the
responses
of
the
jurors
were,
to
use
the
court's
words,
"of
little
moment".
but
then
the
court
refers
to
some
of
the
answers
being
"sensitive"
so
far
as
publication
is
concerned.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument,
the
court
verbalized
that
"the
right
of
privacy
of
the
jurors.
"
to
use
the
court's
words,
"should
prevail,
and
that
the
public's
right
to
know.
"
to
use
the
court's
words,
was
limited.
on
that
basis,
petitioner's
request
for
access
to
the
transcript
was
again
refused.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
agree
with
that,
justice
rehnquist.
on
the
third
occasion,
on
february
23rd,
1982,
after
the
defendant
had
been
tried,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
death--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
am
sorry,
justice
stevens.
that
was...
i
perhaps
was
a
bit
quick
with
my
answer.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
cannot,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
at
this
point
in
time,
cite
the
passage
from
the
constitution.
i
think
we
are
not,
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
concerned
with
the
utilization
or
the
use
of
the
words
"right
to
know".
it
was
a
passage
utilized
by
the
court
during
the
explanation
of
its
rationale
for
having
closed
the
courtroom,
and
i
was
only
referring
to
its
utilization
of
terms
which
were
perhaps
inappropriate
in
the
circumstances,
for
instance,
calling
upon
a
right
of
privacy,
which
separately
is
undefined,
or
at
least
ill-defined
as
it
pertains
to
jurors
at
this
point
in
time.
on
the
third
occasion
when
we
tried
to
secure
access,
we
made
an
ex
parte
motion
to
get
the
release
of
the
transcript,
and
once
again,
the
court
refused.
at
that
time
the
court
indicated
that
most
of
the
information
was
"dull
and
boring",
and
some
of
the
jurors
had,
to
quote
the
court,
"some
special
experiences
in
sensitive
areas
that
do
not
appear
to
be
appropriate
for
public
discussion.
"
when
the
court
of
appeal
in
california
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
refused
our
petitions,
we
came
to
this
court
on
certiorari.
the
voir
dire
proceedings
is,
of
course,
what
we
are
concerned
with
here.
the
respondent
in
its
briefs
has
conceded
that
the
voir
dire
is
a
part
of
the
trial.
this
acknowledgement
by
the
respondent
does
not,
of
course,
eliminate
the
issue.
the
trial
courts
in
california
have
been
closing
the
voir
dire,
as
previously
indicated,
ignoring
the
admonitions
of
this
court
regarding
the
right
of
access
to
public
proceedings.
we
feel
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
make
a
firm
pronouncement
that
the
principle
set
forth
in
richmond
newspapers,
reaffirmed
in
gold
newspaper,
apply
to
the
proceedings
in
connection
with
the
selection
of
the
jury.
we
would
point
to
the
fact
that
the
voir
dire,
as
with
the
evidence
taking
portion
of
the
trial,
has
been
historically
an
open
process.
we
would--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--no,
justice
brennan,
we
would
not
be
satisfied
with
exclusion
from
the
proceedings
itself.
the
transcript
is,
at
best,
a
second
best
alternative.
functionally,
all
of
the
reasoning
of
this
court
that
has
been
applied
to
the
value
of
the
open
trial
process
applies
specifically
to
the
open
voir
dire
process
as
well.
in
order
for
the
court
below
to
close
the
courtroom
in
such
circumstances,
of
course,
the
court
should
have
articulated
on
the
record
findings
that
absent
closure
there
was
a
substantial
probability
of
irreparable
harm
to
a
compelling
interest,
that
no
less
restrictive
alternatives
to
closure
were
available
when
closure
would
effectively
protect
against
the
perceived
harm.
petitioner
feels
that
the
remarks
of
the
court
and
the
brief
statement
in
the
one
written
minute
order
were
inadequate
to
constitute
articulated
findings
in
this
regard.
more
particularly,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
was
no
compelling
interest
which
under
any
circumstances
would
justify
closure
in
this
case.
respondents
advance
two
rationales.
one
is
the
hovey
decision,
and
second,
the
rights
of
juror
privacy.
as
to
the
hovey
decision,
it
is
strongly
our
contention
that
the
hovey
case
does
not
call
for
closure.
hovey
versus
superior
court
was
a
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
which,
so
far
as
it
pertains
to
these
proceedings,
involved
the
interrogation
of
prospective
jurors
in
a
capital
case.
the
hovey
mandate
was
decided
based
upon
a
single
study
by
an
assistant
professor
of
psychology
of
a
group
of
some
67
persons
who
viewed
films
of
simulated
voir
dire
proceedings.
this
was
not
a
study
of
the
impact
of
the
public
and
the
press
upon
the
venire.
there
is
no
mention
of
that
in
the
study
nor
in
the
opinion
itself.
it
was
a
study
of
the
impact
of
the
answers
of
the
venire
persons
one
upon
another.
the
study
concluded
that
members
of
a
venire
in
such
a
case
were
impacted
by
the
procedures
then
in
use
in
california,
and
there
was
a
tendency
to
create
a
predisposition
in
those
jurors
towards
capital
punishment.
accepting
the
findings
of
the
psychological
study
as
sound,
the
california
supreme
court
mandated
that
all
courts
in
the
state
during
the
death
qualifying
questioning
of
jurors
should
question
those
prospective
jurors,
to
use
the
court's
words,
"individually
and
in
sequestration".
the
court,
however,
made
a
clear
statement
in
the
opinion
that
the
ruling
should
not
impact
upon
the
openness
of
the
trial.
the
public
defender
of
the
state
of
california
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
these
proceedings.
the
public
contender
contends,
as
we
do
that
the
hovey
decision
does
not
require
court
closure.
the
public
defender
was,
of
course--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
would
not
espouse
an
absolute
rule.
i
believe
that
one
could
perceive
of
circumstances
where
it
would
be
necessary,
and
i
held
this
court
has
so--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
believe
that
a
hearing
would
has
to
be
held
giving
a
reasonable
right
to
the
public
and
press
to--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--that's
a
problem
of
great
difficulty
that
this
court
has,
i
think,
faced
before.
it
is
a
matter
of
notice,
and
the
right
of
the
court
control
its
own
process.
mr.
james
d.
ward
notice
to
the
public
and
press.
mr.
james
d.
ward
as
to
the
notice?
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
substance
of
the
inquiry,
it
would
strike
me
as,
it
would
be
strictly
as
to
the
necessity
and
the
application
of
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
as
to
closure,
and
the
inquiry
would
go
simply
to
the
requirement
of
the
court
under
the
given
circumstances
to
look
to
any
closure.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
burden
would
be
on
those
seeking
closure.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
think
that
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
would
believe
that
clear
and
convincing
would
be
the
appropriate
standard,
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
first
amendment
right
of
access.
the...
as
i
say,
the
court
in
hovey
indicated
that--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes,
most
assuredly,
justice
brennan,
and
for
a
very
elemental
reason.
when
one
looks
at
voir
dire
as,
if
you
wish
to
distinguish
voir
dire
from
the
evidence-taking
portion
of
the
trial,
the
voir
dire
is
the
time
when
the
public
is
involved
in
the
process
directly.
it
is,
after
all,
the
time
that
the
members
of
the
public
are
chosen
at
random
to
serve
on
the
jury
and
act
as
the
triers
of
fact.
it
is
indeed
the
most
public
part
of
the
trial.
the
voir
dire
by
its
very
nature
is
a
public
process.
only
until
we
were
confronted
with
a
ruling
such
as
hovey
versus
superior
court
was
it
anything
else.
it
couldn't
even
be
conceived
of
as
being
closed
under
the
previous
procedures,
because
the
public
came
into
the
courtroom
to
select
from
the
public
who
was
going
to
be
the
trier
of
fact.
so
it
is
apparent
to
us--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--well,
that's
quite
true,
justice
marshall.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
don't
think,
however,
that
the
presence
of
the
public
is
the
reason
for
the
six
months
or
for
any
lengthy
interrogation.
mr.
james
d.
ward
perhaps
it
lies,
although
i
hesitate
to
say
so,
with
the
fact
that
lawyers
do
the
interrogation.
perhaps
it
lies
with
the
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
breadth
of
questioning
that
they
permit.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
or
no
rationale
which
would
suggest
it
is
because
of
the
presence
of
the
public.
mr.
james
d.
ward
it
would
make
no
difference
whatsoever,
justice
marshall.
despite
the
clear
statement--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
agree.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
i
can't
go
with
the
supposition
in
the
first
place,
justice
stevens.
that
isn't
precisely
what
the
court
said.
the
court
said
that
because
of
the
impact
of
the
venire
persons
observing
the
conduct
of
the
other
venire
persons
when
they
were
interrogated
on
the
death
penalty,
that
there
was
a
predisposition
created
by
these
circumstances,
and
therefore
the
court
reasoned
that
it
would
be
best
if
they
be
questioned
individually.
now,
the
unfortunate
word
usage
was
"and
in
sequestration",
suggesting,
we
believe,
and
as
the
public
defender
believes,
that
you
could...
you
should
have
the
questioning
done
individually,
and
one
juror
at
a
time,
but
there
is
no
reason
to
take
that
outside
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--one
would
have...
if
one
could
follow
all
of
those
suppositions,
i
would
assume
that
if
we
were
convinced
that
the
process
created
a
predisposition
towards
the
death
penalty,
one
would
have
to
consider
it
a
compelling
reason
to
consent
to
closure,
but
i
can't
agree,
of
course,
with
any
of
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--oh,
absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
the
clear
statement
of
the
court
was
a
problem...
rather,
the
clear
statement
of
the
court
in
the
use
of
the
word
"sequestration"
was
a
problem
to
the
trial
courts
in
california,
and
their
interpretation
of
this
was
spotty
and
mixed.
the
courts
below
attempted
at
times
to
close
only
the
death
qualifying
questions,
at
times
close
the
entire
voir
dire,
and
at
times
did
not
close
it
at
all.
the
fault,
perhaps,
is
in
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--assuming
for
the
moment,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
some
right
of
the
juror
to
refrain
from
responding
to
a
question
for
whatever
reason
similar
to
the
ones
that
you
may
have
posited
there,
the
fact
remains
that
i
can
conceive
of
no
circumstance
why
it
would
be
necessary
to
close
the
courtroom
in
order
to
solve
that
problem
for
the
juror,
because
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
available
to
the
court
to
avoid
any
damage
to
any
perceived
right
of
the
juror
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
most
obvious
being,
of
course,
that
the
court
could
excuse
the
juror
before
invading
any
perceived
right
of
privacy,
because
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
and
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
but
not
to
a
specific
juror.
it
is
a
process
of
random
selection
in
any
event,
and
it
is
a
matter,
even
as
respondent's
brief
has
pointed
out,
is
a
matter
of
chance
as
to
whether
one
is
called
to
the
venire,
or
sits
in
the
box.
i
submit
that
a
juror
with
a
perceived
privacy
problem
is
no
different
than
a
person
who
has
an
illness
or
for
some
particular
reason,
is
going
to
have
an
operation
the
following
week
and
cannot
sit
on
the
trial,
or
has
some
physical
infirmity
or
disability.
there
is
no
reason
to
retain
a
juror
whose
rights
would
be
potentially
offended
by
the
questioning,
but
the
point
remains
that
the
process
can
remain
open,
because
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
desire
to
have
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
and
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
are
the
same
rights
espoused
by
the
public
and
the
press
under
what
we
believe
their
first
amendment
right
of
access
to
be.
they
wish
to
see
the
process
accomplished
in
the
same
way.
mr.
james
d.
ward
it
would
be
my
position,
yes,
that
the
questionnaires,
being
part
of
the
process,
should
be
available
to
the
press,
but
if
i
may
elaborate
on
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
the
use
of
questionnaires
is
one
of
those
less
restrictive
alternatives
that
could
help
us
avoid
the
problem
with
the
juror
and
yet
permit
the
public
access
to
the
proceedings,
because
i
submit
that
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
case,
one
of
the
more
common
sensitive
areas
with
which
we
are
concerned
is,
for
instance,
sexual
preferences,
and
if
the
questionnaires
were
directed
in
such
a
way
to
elicit
from
jurors
whether
any
of
them
harbored
any
feelings
or
had
any
problems
in
these
areas,
it
could
be
resolved
short
of
offending
any
juror's
rights
in
that
regard,
and
we
believe
that
questionnaires
is
indeed
one
of
the
very
viable,
less
restrictive
alternatives
that
would
be
available
to
the
court.
mr.
james
d.
ward
the
protection
arrives,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
use
of
careful
questioning,
and
the
judge
at
the
trial
level
controlling
the
court
can
see
to
it
that
the
questioning
does
not
offend
areas
of
potential
privacy
or
sensitivity
if
they
exist.
mr.
james
d.
ward
absolutely,
justice
brennan.
we
believe
that
the
public
and
press
should
be
present
during
the
procedure,
and
we
see
no
reason
why
that
should
be
inconsistent
with
hovey.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we
would
find
inappropriate
the
interrogation
of
jurors
in
chambers.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
justice
brennan.
we
believe
it
is
part
of
the
open
process.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--we
make
that...
we
do
not
make
that
suggestion
at
this
time,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
will
be
back.
no,
i...
we
do
not
make
such
a
suggestion
at
this
time.
the
fact
is,
though,
that
the
hovey
decision
potentially
is
being
read
by
the
courts
as
calling
for
closure,
and
in
fact
i
would
add
parenthetically
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
kentucky
so
interpreted
the
case
in
a
recent,
very
recent
decision
where
it
said
that
the
defendants
in
the
state
of
california
have
the
right
to
a
closed
voir
dire.
now,
if
the
case
is
read
that
way,
it
violates
this
court's
decision
in
globe,
because
it
is
then
a
mandate
requiring
closure,
and
we
submit
that
this
case,
hovey
versus
superior
court,
is
no
different
than
a
statute
such
as
the
type
that
you
interpreted,
the
massachusetts
statute
in
the
globe
case.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we
would
contend
fervently
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
trial,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
james
d.
ward
well,
the
trial
in
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state
of
california
has
been
defined...
has
been
defined
as
commencing
with
the
selection
of
the
jury.
we
also
are
enamored
with
the
reasoning
of
u.s.
versus
brooklier
in
the
ninth
circuit,
where
they
held
specifically
that
the
voir
dire
was
a
part
of
the
trial
process,
but
i
would
point
out,
if
i
may,
that
whether
you
define
the
trial
as
commencing
with
the
beginning
of
the
selection
of
the
jurors
or
as
of
the
time
of
the
calling
of
the
first
witness,
you
look
to
the
reasoning
for
openness,
and
the
rationale
for
openness
of
richmond,
which
applied
to
the
evidence-taking
of
the
trial,
evidence-taking
portion,
we
believe
applies
equally
if
not
more
forcefully
in
the
voir
dire.
mr.
james
d.
ward
not
necessarily.
we
are
not
dealing
here,
of
course,
with
pretrial
publicity
as
a
problem.
we
are
dealing
here
with,
of
course,
the
selection
of
the
jury
as
a
part
of
the
process,
which
we
contend
that
it
is.
mr.
james
d.
ward
we
are
not
prepared
at
this
time
to
indicate
that
all
of
the
proceedings
which
go
on
prior
to
the...
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
jury
selection
are
a
part
of
the
trial.
mr.
james
d.
ward
all
right,
justice
o'connor,
i
am
sorry.
you
are
quite
right.
it
is
a
very
fair
question
and
comment.
my
position
would
be
that
openness
should
prevail.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--pardon
me,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
james
d.
ward
certainly,
justice
blackmun,
you
did
get
into
it
in
the
gannett
case,
which...
it
was
approached
from
the
sixth
amendment
analysis,
and
we
are
not,
of
course,
in
this
case
claiming
any
sixth
amendment
right
of
access.
as
you
are
well
aware,
in
gannett,
you
did
not
get
to
the
first
amendment
right
of
access
at
that
time.
if
i
have
any
additional
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
james
d.
ward
no,
i
think
not,
justice
white,
because
i
think
that
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
do
submit
that
it
is
part?
oh,
we
definitely
believe
that
under
california
law
the
voir
dire--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--absolutely.
absolutely.
but
even
if
anyone
should
be
persuaded
or
convinced
that
it
is
better
to
think
of
the
trial
as
commencing
with
the
first
witness,
nonetheless--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes,
that's
true,
so
let's
keep
as
part
of
the
trial.
0
[generallaughter.]
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
ward
double--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--jeopardy
attaches
with
the
commencement
of
the
taking
of
testimony,
but
the
test
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
significantly
different.
you
are
dealing
with
the
right
of
an
individual,
and
when
does
jeopardy
apply,
and
that
could
be
rationale
to
involve
the--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes.
mr.
james
d.
ward
that
is
correct.
if
i
have
any
additional
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it.
mr.
james
d.
ward
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
is
a
closure
case.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
an
appropriate
case
for
deciding
right
of
juror
privacy.
not
only
is
it
a
case
devoid
of
any
record
regarding
the
matter
of
juror
privacy,
but
it
is
devoid
of
any
juror
claiming
any
right.
all
that
we
have
are
vague
references
by
counsel
and
the
court
to
the
possibility
of
some
sensitivities
of
jurors.
we
have
no
evidence
at
this
point
and
on
this
record
that
any
juror
objected
to
any
question,
or
that
there
was
indeed
any
invasion
of
any
right,
whether...
any
concern,
indeed,
for
a
jural
privacy
whatsoever.
mr.
james
d.
ward
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
use
of
that
sort
of
a
process
is
one
of
the
less
restrictive
alternatives
which
is
available,
because
assuming
for
the
moment
that
there
is
defined--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--yes,
most
assuredly,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
would
have
to.
if
ultimately
it
were
determined
that
there
were
a
protected
area,
we
would
have
to
avoid
the
disclosure
of
that
area,
but
the
point
is
that
it
is
a
closure
case
where
the
court
closed
it
on
the
rationale
of
a
california
supreme
court
decision
and
then
only
on
a
post
hoc
rationalization
did
it
come
forward
with
this
rationale
of
juror
privacy.
when
we
addressed
the
closure
issue
in
the
first
instance,
it
was
based
upon
hovey
versus
superior
court.
after
the
case
was
closed,
when
we
went
to
get
the
transcript--
mr.
james
d.
ward
--i
am
sorry.
thank
you.
