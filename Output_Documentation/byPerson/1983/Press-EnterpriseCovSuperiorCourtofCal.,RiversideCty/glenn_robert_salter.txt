mr.
glenn
robert
salter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
a
situation
which
calls
for
the
delicate
balancing
of
three
fundamental
interests,
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
a
defendant
to
a
fair
trial,
the
first
amendment
right
of
the
press
to
gather
and
report
the
news,
and
the
first
amendment
and
penumbral
rights
of
the
prospective
jurors
to
a
right
to
privacy.
the
issue
as
we
perceive
it
is
not
whether
there
is
a
right
of
access
by
the
public
to
voir
dire
proceedings.
rather,
we
see
the
fundamental
issue
to
be
the
extent
of
the
juror's
right
to
privacy.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
yes.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
right
to
privacy
is
not
specifically
enumerated
in
either
the
constitution
or
in
the
bill
of
rights.
however,
this
court
has
interpreted
that
there
is
a
right
to
privacy
that
goes
even
beyond,
has
roots
even
deeper
than
the
bill
of
rights,
and
we
take
that
right
to
privacy
and
we
say
that
an
individual
has
an
inherent
right
to
privacy.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
think
we
cited
several
in
the
brief,
for
instance
griswald,
the
griswald
case.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
believe
our
position
would
be,
yes,
he
would
have
that
right.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
we
had
a
case
in
california
that
just
went
up
on
appeal.
a
decision
came
out
about
i'd
say
two
to
three
months
ago.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
am
sorry.
the
case
was,
i
believe,
bobb
versus
municipal
court,
in
which
a
prospective
juror,
an
attorney,
as
it
turned
out,
refused
to
answer
a
question,
and
she
was
held
in
contempt
by
the
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
in
her
particular
case,
her
refusal
was
appropriate.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
no,
she
was--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--well,
i
think
the
question
is
appropriate,
though,
because
her
response
really
was,
you
are
asking
the
male
jurors
questions
as...
you
do
not
ask
them
what
their
spouse
does,
but
you
ask
the
female
jurors
what
their
husband's
occupation
is,
and
she
says,
that
violates
my
rights,
and
i
am
going
to
refuse
to
answer,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
she
had
that
right.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
it
was
not
a
right
to
privacy
issue.
the
issue
was--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--the
fact
that
she
could
refuse.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
believe...
i
am
unaware
of
any
case
which
has
supported
that,
but
i
believe
that
a
juror
would
have
that
right.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
well,
we
start
with
the--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--if
the
juror
was
drunk,
he
would
probably
be
released
on
the
grounds
of
being
an
incompetent
juror.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
he
would
have
to
have
some
basis
for
it.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
he
would
have
to
have
some
basis
for
refusing
to
respond
to
the--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--no.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
yes,
i
believe
he
could.
he
would,
however,
have
to
have
some
basis
for
that
right
to
privacy.
he
could
not
simply
say,
i
am
not
going
to
answer
based
on
privacy
unless--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--no,
i
don't
believe
so.
what
we
are
saying
is,
for
instance--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--let
me
give
you--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--let
me
give
you
an
example.
let's
assume
that
the
question,
and
it
is
a
question
which
probably
came
up
in
the
very
case
we
are
dealing
with,
how
did
you
vote
on
a
particular
issue,
that
being
the
death
penalty
issue.
that
issue
has
been
on
the
ballot
in
the
state
of
california.
i
think
a
defendant
has
a
legitimate
right
in
asking
that
question.
i
also
think
that
a
juror
could
legitimately
say,
i'm
sorry,
but
the
ballot
box
is
secret,
and
you
cannot
compel
me
to
answer
that
particular
question.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
part
of
the
reason
that
voir
dire
has
taken
so
long
is
because
of
the
very
recent
case
of
people
versus
williams.
that
case
held
that
you
may
ask
questions
which
legitimately
could
give
you
grounds
to
use
your
peremptory
challenges,
and
so
it
allows
you
to
go
into
areas
that
prior
to
that
you
could
not...
were
supposedly
not
allowed
to
go
into
in
the
state
of
california.
you
could
really
only
ask
questions
dealing
with...
going
to
the
issue
of
cause.
but
they
expanded
that
and
said
very
specifically,
you
can
ask
questions
which
are
reasonably
related
to
a
peremptory
challenge,
and
that
would
include
issues
dealing
with
sex,
race,
religion,
politics,
anything
which
was
reasonably
related
to
the
particular
case
at
hand,
and
that
is
in
large
part
the
reason
that
the
one
case
that
mr.
ward
referred
to
went
five
months.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
voir
dire
was
not
made
available.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
no,
i
have
not.
i
did
not
feel
that
was
any
of
my
business.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
what
occurred
was
that
they
held
three
days
of
general
voir
dire,
asking
the
typical
voir
dire
questions.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
but
then,
after
that,
issues
which
dealt
with
matters
of
privacy,
sexual
relations,
race,
religion,
politics,
those
questions
were
then
reserved
for
that
part
of
the
voir
dire
which
was
held
privately.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
not
having
read
it,
i
could
not
tell
you.
i
can
only
tell
you
that
the
trial
judge
held
those
matters
in
private
according
to
what's
in
the
transcript,
and
so
that
those
matters
were
dealt
with.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
no,
i
am
unaware,
your
honor--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--certainly,
i
am
sure
we
can
make
that
available.
it
is
about
4,000
pages,
and
we
can
certainly
make
it
available
to
the
court
if
the
court
wishes
to
see
it.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
no,
it
was...
when
the
appendix
was
put
together--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--it
was
the
joint
decision
by
counsel
to
include
what
was
included.
it
was
not
intended
in
any
way
to
deprive
this
court
of
seeing
any
information
that
it
thought
was
relevant
or
that
it
needed
to
see,
and
we
would
certainly
be
more
than
willing
to
make
it
available,
sealed
in
the
manner
in
which
the
trial
court
ordered
that
it
was
sealed.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
a
transcript
was
made
of
it,
and
it
was
under
seal,
and
it
was
distributed
to
counsel
who
would
deal
with
the
matter
on
appeal,
but
any
references
to
that
transcript
are,
according
to
the
trial
court's
order,
to
be
done
in
a
confidential
manner,
so
if
there
is
any
question
as
far
as
the
propriety
of
questions
asked
at
the
voir
dire
or
in
the
selection
of
the
jury,
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
would
have
the
option
and
the
ability
to
deal
with
that
question.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
think
first
it
is
important
that
the
newspaper
did
not
point
out
at
the
time
of
trial,
either
before
the
voir
dire
occurred
or
after
it
occurred,
any
possible
alternatives,
and
the
trial
court
did,
i
believe,
choose
an
alternative,
and
i
think
probably
the
most
appropriate
alternative.
they
did
in
their
reply
brief
provide
five
suggested
alternatives.
i
don't
think
that
any
one
of
those
alternatives
really
serves
the
primary
interest.
if
you--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--it
is
related
to
the
problem
of
peremptory
challenges,
yes.
the
initial
case
in
california
was
the
edwards
case,
which
limited
your
voir
dire
questions
to
areas
that
you
could
reasonably
use
for
cause,
in
challenge
for
cause.
however,
the
court
found
that
that
rule
was
honored
more
in
its
breach,
and
so
it
decided
that
appropriately
you
could
inquire
into
areas
dealing
with
the
issue
of
laying
bases
for
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
basically
that's
true.
one
of
the
cases
that
the
williams
case
cited
dealt
with
the
issue
of
a
rape
case,
and
could
you
inquire
of
the
jurors
whether
they
had
had
similar
experiences,
and
the
supreme
court
at
the
time
that
decision
was
handed
down
said,
no,
you
couldn't,
but
it
is
quite
clear
now
that
under
the
williams
case,
you
can
ask
those
questions
in
california.
it
is
a
legitimate
area
of
inquiry.
and
it
is
a
very
private
and
sensitive
area
that
many
people
would
not,
i
believe,
wish
to
respond
to,
whether
they
had
been
perhaps
sexually
abused
or
sexually
assaulted.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
believe
it
is
26,
although
they
are
allowed
to
augment.
speaking
back
to
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
any
alternatives,
i
don't
believe
the
juror
questionnaires
solves
that
particular
problem
because,
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
pointed
out,
the
newspaper
would
want
to
have
those
made
public,
and
so
it
would
not
make
any
difference
therefore
whether
you--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--i
think
the
problem
in
a
small
community
would
be
that
if
the
public
is
allowed
to
come
into
the
courtroom,
even
if
a
juror
had,
instead
of
a
tag
that
said
juror
on
it,
it
said
number
18,
someone
in
the
audience
may
very
well
know
who
that
person
is,
and
so
that
person
may
very
well
say
juror
number
18,
who
happens
to
be
someone
next
door
to
me,
answered
the
question
this
way.
there
is
no
real
right
to
privacy.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
think
some
of
the
same
problems
arise,
because
it
is
the
answers
which
you
can
begin
to
relate
to
certain
individuals,
and
i
think
it's
the
issue
that
people
would
be
able
to
tell
from
either
the
types
of
questions
or
the
responses
given
who
those
individuals
might
be.
it
is,
i
think,
a
bigger
problem
in
a
smaller
community,
but
you
can,
and
the
newspapers
are
well
known
for
their
detective
work,
you
can
very
well
find
out
who
the
individuals
are.
it
can
be
made
public.
you
can
know
who
those
people
might
be.
and
so
i
do
not
believe
that
the
questionnaire
really
is
a
viable
alternative,
because
in
the
long
run
the
question
still
comes
out.
they
offered
an
alternative
of
screening
questions.
once
again,
i
think
you
have
a
similar
problem
with
your
questionnaires.
if
the
question
is,
have
you
or
anyone
in
your
family
ever
been
sexually
abused,
it
is
very
difficult
to
either...
to
screen
that
question
or
to
rephrase
that
question
in
a
way
that
does
not
require
the
prospective
juror
to
provide
the
same
basic
information.
and
so
i
do
not
believe
that
that
provides
any
real
alternative,
because
when
you
are
talking
about
the
issue
of
privacy,
it
is
the
nature,
it
is
the
answer
which
is
more
important
than
it
is
the
question.
i
also
do
not
believe
that
excusing
jurors
who
say...
or
who
describe...
or
who
refrain
from
describing
intimate
information
is
really,
once
again,
a
viable
alternative,
especially
if
that
is
done
in
open
court.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
one
juror
to
see
another
juror
offer
an
excuse,
and
have
the
trial
judge
allow
that
juror
to
be
let
go.
a
prospective
juror
who
does
not
wish
to
see
will
simply
mimic
that
excuse,
and
so
you
have
the
problem
of
being
able
to
effectively
deal
with
the
juror
panel
which
is
actually
in
the
court
itself,
and
to
effectively
ask
each
one
questions
and
be
certain
that
you
are
getting
valid
responses
and
that
they
will
not
offer
you
simply
excuses
to
avoid
their
jury
duty
and
their
public
duty.
mr.
salter,
i
find
that
argument
rather
strange.
you
are
implying
that
most
members
of
the
panel
will
give
false
excuses
when
under
oath
during
a
voir
dire?
just
because
somebody
ahead
of
them
said
they
needed
a
babysitter,
everybody
else
is
going
to
make
the
same
statement?
there
have
been
several--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--i
think
we
need
to
presume
that
they
will
tell
the
truth.
unfortunately,
there
is
somewhat
of
a
prevalent
trend
nowadays
for
people
to
either
want
to
serve
or
not
want
to
serve.
it
is
very
difficult
if
you
come
to
a
case
and
the
trial
judge
says,
this
case
should
probably
take
six
weeks
to
try.
it
may
take
five
months
for
voir
dire
questioning.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
to
be
willing
to--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--i
am
not
suggesting
per
se
that
the
jurors
would
lie
simply
to
get
off
a
juror.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
on
the
other
hand,
it
presents
a
very
difficult
problem
for
a
trial
judge
to
deal
with
prospective
jurors,
because
it
opens
up
the
opportunity
to
inflate
what
are
otherwise
legitimate
reasons
for
perhaps
asking
to
be
released
from
jury
duty,
and
that
is,
i
think,
a
problem
for
a
trial
court
judge.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
areas
which
we
are
referring
to...
we
have
no
problems
with
that
type
of
a
question.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
question--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--the
question
is,
we--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--the
question
as
we
saw
it,
was
that
a
viable
alternative,
and
we
felt
that
from
a
practical
standpoint,
for
the
decent
management
of
the
trial
court
system,
it
did
not
offer
a
practical
alternative.
we
think
that
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
followed
the
richmond
standards
which
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court.
this
court
basically
set
out
three
criteria,
three
questions
to
be
asked.
did
the
trial
court
recognize
the
right
of
the
public
and
press
to
attend
the
trial?
did
the
trial
court
consider
alternatives?
and
finally,
were
there
findings
on
the
record
to
support
the
closure?
we
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
trial
court
in
this
particular
case
did
recognize
the
right.
number
one,
there
was
a
motion
brought
by
the
newspaper
which
informed
the
court
of
that
right.
in
statements
made
by
the
court,
the
court
very
specifically
said,
yes,
there
is
a
right
for
the
public
to
know.
and
so
on
that
first
prong
we
believe
the
court
very
clearly
satisfied
that
first
prong.
second
thing,
did
the
trial
court
consider
alternatives?
once
again,
although
the
newspaper
did
say
there
were
alternatives,
the
newspaper
never
offered
any
alternatives,
and
we
believe
a
newspaper
does
at
least
have
a
responsibility
to
at
the
time
that
they
make
their
request
initially
offer
some
alternatives
so
that
the
trial
court
has
the
ability
to
consider
them.
but
we
also
feel
that
the
trial
court
in
this
case
did
adopt
an
alternative,
which
is
perhaps
the
most
feasible
in
protecting
everybody's
rights,
and
that
is,
they
allowed
questions
into
areas
which
would
be
traditionally
governed
by
the
right
of
privacy.
that
assured
that
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights
would
be
protected.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
it
represents
an
alternative
because
we,
number
one,
believe
that
the
right
to
privacy
should
not
be
invaded
unless
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
are
allowing
that
simply
and
solely
for
the
very
limited
purpose
of
giving
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
but
there
is
no
reason
that
that
should
be
extended
or
expanded
so
that
the
press
or
the
public
can
delve
into
those
private
areas
of
a
person's
individual
life.
and
if
it
turns
out
that
there
are
not
areas,
that
the
areas
covered
were
not
sensitive,
the
trial
court
could
then
release
those
questions.
the
trial
court
was
asked
in
this
case
to
do
that.
the
trial
court
felt
that
the
questions
dealt
with
sensitive
areas,
invaded
the
right
to
privacy,
and
should
not
be
released
to
the
press.
that
is
very
much
an
alternative
to
simply
saying,
no,
it
is
a
right
to
privacy,
therefore
you
cannot
ask
that
question.
it
allows
us
to
give
the
defendant,
the
accused,
his
sixth
amendment
rights,
but
it
protects
the
first
amendment
rights
of
both
the
prospective
juror
and
it
does
protect
in
the
long
run
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
press.
finally,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
were
any
findings
on
the
record.
we
believe
once
again
that
there
are
sufficient
findings
on
the
record.
the
primary
reason
for
requiring
that,
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
a
reviewing
court
would
have
the
opportunity
of
seeing
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
truly
considered
and
balanced
the
various
rights
involved,
and
it
is
very
clear
through
the
arguments
made
in
particular
by
both
the
district
attorney
and
by
the
attorney
representing
the
defendant
that
all
of
these
arguments
were
made,
the
balancing
arguments,
the
privacy
arguments,
the
need
for,
in
this
particular
case,
as
to
those
issues
that
are
sensitive,
the
need
for
closure,
and
that
the
trial
judge
then
adopted
those
reasons
and
the
bases
for
that,
and
in
doing
so
at
that
point
he
decided
to
partially
close.
he
very
clearly
stated
when
they
asked
to
have
the
transcript
released
that
there
was
a
right
to
privacy,
that
it
should
not
be
invaded.
he
recognized
the
right
of
the
press.
he
also
recognized
the
rights
of
the
prospective,
and
in
this
case
the
jurors.
we
feel
there
are
sufficient
findings
on
the
record.
and
as
a
result,
once
the
trial
court
satisfied
that
three-pronged
standard
of
richmond,
we
feel
the
trial
court
did
what
he
was
required
to
do.
the
newspaper
may
not
like
the
decision
which
was
made
by
the
trial
court,
but
the
trial
court
followed
the
very
explicit
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
it
is
our
feeling,
very
clearly,
that
any
case
of
this
nature
must
be
dealt
with
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
are
not
advocating
that
there
be
closure
in
every
single
case.
we
are
not
advocating
that
there
be
closure
every
time
there
is
voir
dire,
or
any
time
voir
dire
extends
more
than
a
day.
the
problem
is
that--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--the
hovey
case
very
specifically
said--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--that
it
does
not
affect
the
open
nature
of
the
trial.
in
that
sense,
hovey
does
not
require
closure.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
--yes,
they
did.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
rationale...
are
you
asking
the
question
as
to
once...
now
that
the
trial
is
over?
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
i
believe
those
questions
could
very
well
fall
into
the
category
of
the
right
to
privacy
as
to
your
political
views.
and
i
think
that
is
probably
where
those
questions
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
judge
went.
mr.
glenn
robert
salter
the
primary
rationale
of
hovey
does
not
require
closure
per
se,
but
when
you
deal
with
hovey
on
a
lengthy
basis,
you
have
a
lengthy
voir
dire,
i
think
at
that
particular
point,
during
the
time
the
voir
dire
is
taking
place,
it
is
quite
appropriate
for
the
court
to
close
it
so
that
the
questions,
the
responses,
the
issues
which
are
dealt
with
do
not
become
part
of
the
record
for
prospective
jurors
who
might
not
at
that
particular
point
be
called.
obviously,
on
a
five-month
voir
dire
it
is
quite
possible
that
there
are
people
out
there
who
will
not
have
been
called
at
the
time
the
case
started
but
may
very
well
read
of
the
case
and
read
of
the
responses.
so
at
that
point
that
is
very
crucial
and
very
important.
i
do
not
believe
necessarily,
but
i
think
the
trial
court
did,
that
it
goes
into
an
area
dealing
with
perhaps
the
issue
of
political
right
to
privacy
and
expressing
your
views,
because
obviously
the
death
qualification
issue
is
an
emotional
argument.
it
deals
with
how
did
you
vote
on
a
particular
issue.
it
is
very
much
intertwined
with
it.
and
so
i
think
there
is
a
very
difficult
problem
in
dealing
with
that.
it
once
again
is
going
to
be
resolved
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
there
may
very
well
be
cases
where
asking
questions
about
death-qualifying
issues
will
not
invade
that
particular
right,
what
you
might
call
your
garden
variety
capital
case.
but
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
the
publicity
involved,
the
extent
of
it,
the
trial
judge,
i
think
correctly,
found
that
it
was
all
part
of
that
whole
concept
of
a
right
to
privacy,
of
not
having
to
disclose
how
you
voted
on
a
particular
issue.
we
feel,
once
again,
that
the
trial
court
met
the
standards
set
forth
by
this
court
in
richmond.
we
feel
that
that
was
what
the
trial
court
was
obligated
to
do,
and
it
performed
it
in
the
best
manner
that
it
could.
for
that
reason,
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
should
be
affirmed.
