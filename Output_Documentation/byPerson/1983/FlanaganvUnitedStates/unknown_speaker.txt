unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
all
this?
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
never
been
found
by
anybody.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
disputed
by
the
indictment
surely.
unknown
speaker
they
are
disputed
by
the
indictment.
you
say
there
are
no
inculpatory
facts.
your
clients
have
been
indicted.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
i
do
not
think...
you
must
assume
the
possibility
that
there
is
some
evidence
of
guilt
that
will
surface
sooner
or
later.
unknown
speaker
at
some
time
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
this
order
was
appealable?
unknown
speaker
at
your
own
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
some
per
se
reversal
rule
were
adopted
you
would
not
have
difficulty.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubenstone,
the
cobbledick
case
says
that
the
policy
especially
in
criminal
cases
is
against
piecemeal
appeals,
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
appeal
like
this
first
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
conceivably
here
if
certiorari
is
granted
does
delay
the
start
of
the
criminal
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubenstone,
are
there
any
cases
to
your
knowledge
in
which
a
faretta
situation
if
a
defendant
is
denied
the
opportunity
to
represent
himself
for
whatever
reason
that
that
has
been
held
to
be
immediately
appealable
on
an
interlocutory
basis?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
similar
situation?
unknown
speaker
no,
well
let's
say
he
wanted
to
represent
himself
and
for
whatever
reason
the
court
determined,
for
instance,
he
was
not
capable
of
doing
it
and
appointed
counsel
and
the
defendant
insisted
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
that
question.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
found
no
case?
unknown
speaker
but
your
suggestion
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
that
if
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved
there
must
be
a
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
certainly
is
not
supported
by
our
cases.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
one
of
the
criteria
for
immediate
appeal
is
that
the
issue
would
not
otherwise
be
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
if
the
criminal
trial
had
gone
on
and
there
had
been
no
appeal
you
could
still
have
raised
the
issue
and
had
the
issue
reviewed
at
the
end
of
the...
at
least
the
defendant
could
have.
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
could
have
if
he
had
been
convicted
in
an
appeal.
he
could
have
raised
this
issue
that
he
was
denied
counsel
of
his
choice.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
was
right
there
would
be
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
my
question
really
was
do
you
think
that
it
is
one
of
the
criteria
for
immediate
appeal
that
the
issue
that
you
want
to
appeal
is
not
otherwise
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
went
quite
a
ways
toward
answering
just
a
minute
ago.
you
said
you
really
could
not
get
the
relief
you
wanted.
unknown
speaker
you
think
if
there
is
any
real
doubt
about
your
ability
to
get
a
new
trial
even
if
you
show
that
your
right
had
been
denied
that
it
is
not
effectively
reviewable?
unknown
speaker
is
your
position
grounded
in
the
constitution?
i
take
it
it
is.
unknown
speaker
the
position
that
you
should
have
been
entitled...
that
your
client
should
have
been
entitled
to
joint
representation?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
sixth.
on
the
ground
that
you
have
the
right
to
choose
the
counsel
of
your
choice?
unknown
speaker
or
just
to
have
counsel?
unknown
speaker
what
did
faretta
decide?
what
constitutional
issue
did
faretta
decide?
unknown
speaker
based
on
what
provision?
unknown
speaker
we
have
not
given
indigent
defendants
a
right
to
select
their
own
lawyer
have
we?
unknown
speaker
we
have
not
recognized
the
right
of
an
indigent
defendant
to
select
a
nonpublic
defender,
for
example,
or
even
in
the
private
sector
a
lawyer
of
the
defendant's
choice
that
the
public
will
pay
for.
we
have
not
done
that.
we
have
provided
counsel,
but
not
counsel
of
choice.
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
speaking
of
it
as
though
it
was
a
right
to
choose.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
mentioned
the
first
amendment.
how
about
the
freedom
of
association?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
rubenstone,
getting
back
to
the
interlocutory
appeal
question
have
we
not
normally
treated
violations
of
a
sixth
amendment
right
or
even
a
due
process
right
as
being
in
criminal
cases
not
reviewable
by
way
of
interlocutory
appeal?
unknown
speaker
would
this
foreclose
a
later
claim
that
he
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
do
what
you
suggest
by
him
if
he
wound
up
with
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
came
in
and
said
that
his
counsel
did
not
make
a
complete
disclosure
and
he
did
not
understand
what
he
was
doing
and
the
trial
judge
should
have
conducted
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
was
a
sound
decision?
unknown
speaker
without
the
hearing
would
your
position
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
judge
must
conduct
a
hearing
before
he
can
in
effect
intervene
between
the
defendant
or
defendants
and
his
or
their
choice
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
rubenstone...
i
take
it
you
are
ready
to
go
to
the
merits
now?
unknown
speaker
supposing
if
while
the
trial
is
in
progress
some
evidence
comes
out
that
persuades
you
that
one
of
your
clients
was
lying
to
you...
sometimes
we
are
all
disillusioned
by
our
clients.
it
happened
to
me
i
know...
and
you
come
to
the
conviction
that
one
of
them
has
much
greater
possible
culpability
than
the
remainder
and
at
the
same
time
the
government
offers
some
kind
of
a
deal
with
respect
to
one
not
involved
in
the
culpability.
how
do
you
handle
that
situation
if
it
should
arise?
you
do
not
expect
it,
but
should
it.
unknown
speaker
let's
leave
out
the
first
half
of
my
suggestion.
supposing
the
government
merely
offers
a
separate
arrangement
with
one
of
your
clients
on
condition
that
the
others...
just
that
one.
has
a
conflict
developed?
unknown
speaker
on
whom
would
the
client
rely
for
advice?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
first
half
of
my
question?
supposing
you
just
get
information
that
develops
during
the
trial
that
persuades
you
that
one
client
has
much
greater
exposure
than
the
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
pretty
good
chance
he
will
be
found
guilty
and
there
is
a
pretty
good
chance
the
others
would
be
not
guilty
and
you
can
assure
it
by
taking
a
plea
of
some
kind
or
getting
the
charges
dismissed
against
one
if
he
would
fill
out
the
facts
with
respect
to--
unknown
speaker
--so
it
is
entirely
possible
that
in
this
case
the
facts
may
develop
later
on
in
which
you
might
have
to
withdraw?
unknown
speaker
but
your
answer...
the
solution
is
to
meet
them
when
they
arise?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rubenstone,
why
is
it
do
you
suppose
that
the
government
would
take
such
an
active
role
in
trying
to
seek
disqualification?
is
it
a
factor
in
part
of
a
feeling
that
the
defendants
are
less
likely
to
break
up
and
negotiate
separate
pleas
if
they
are
represented
by
one
attorney?
why
is
the
government
pressing?
unknown
speaker
and
turn
state's
evidence?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you--
--mr.
rubenstone,
you
say
that
the
court
below
went
off
on
what
you
call
potential
problems
and
what
they
may
have
called
potential
conflicts.
supposing
that
the
facts
here
had
been
far
more
dramatic
than
are
revealed
by
this
record
where
the
government
had
indicted
two
people
and
one
was
clearly
liable
as
perhaps
an
aider
and
abetter
and
another
as
a
principle
but
the
government's
witnesses
could
not
identify
which
was
which
so
there
was
just
almost
a
built-in
conflict
from
the
beginning
as
to
who
was
going
to
get
the
bigger
rap.
would
you
say
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
disqualify
joint
representation
in
that
situation
where
you
would
have
no
problems
but
just
almost
a
demonstrated
conflict?
unknown
speaker
so
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
really
what
this
record
showed
as
respecting
whether
there
was
a
demonstrated
conflict
or
whether
the
standard
is
potential
conflict?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask
you
this?
if
we
were
to
agree
with
your
friend
and
agree
with
his
proposition
would
it
mean
that
in
a
faretta
case
after
the
judge
had
conducted
a
hearing
on
the
qualifications
of
the
defendant
to
act
as
his
own
counsel
and
then
decided
that
he
was
not
qualified
and
appointed
standby,
would
that
be
appealable?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
there
had
been
a
trial
here
and
the
trial
judge
denied...
if
he
did
just
the
reverse
and
held
the
trial
and
there
was
a
conviction
and
appeal
and
one
of
the
issues
was
he
should
have
been
entitled
to
joint
representation
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
exactly...
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
should
have
been--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
should
not
have
been,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
would
there
have
been
automatically
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
not
mean
then
that
the
issue
really
is
not
effectively
appealable
after--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it
may
not
be
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal,
mr.
frey.
i
mean
that
is
the
point
that
judge
friendly
made
in
his
opinion
that
this
particular
kind
of
order
simply
is
not
effectively
reviewable.
i
notice
the
second
circuit
has
adopted
a
split
rule
that
orders
denying
disqualification
of
counsel
are
not
immediately
appealable
but
orders
granting
them
are.
what
do
you
think
about
that?
unknown
speaker
is
the
appealability
not
a
factor
in
part
of
how
you
decide
the
merits?
if
it
is
a
per
se
rule
then
maybe
it
should
not
be
immediately
reviewable
on
appeal.
if
it
is
some
other
rule
on
the
merits
then
maybe--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
government's
motive
since
we
are
talking
about
motives
here
apparently?
what
is
the
government's
motive
in
trying
to
disqualify
in
a
case
such
as
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
make
it
easier
in
a
case
of
codefendants
to
get
a
plea
agreement
out
of
one
of
them,
does
it
not,
if
they
are
not
represented
by
just
one
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
a
lot
easier
if
you
have
one
of
them
who
has
confessed
and
testifying
against
the
other.
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
if
there
has
been
a
valid
waiver
what
public
interest
is
served
by
the
failure
to
initiate
a
plea
bargain
on
behalf
of
one
defendant
when
his
counsel
does
not
recommend
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
to
defend
the
order
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
here
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
district
court
at
any
time
it
wants
to
is
going
to
be
able
to
disqualify
an
effort
at
joint
representation
because
it
makes
plea
bargaining
less
likely.
i
think
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
on
the
other
hand
the
district
judge
here
disqualified
these
lawyers
from
representing
any
of
the
four.
do
you
have
any
comment
about
that?
they
were
not
allowed
even
to
represent
mr.
flanagan.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
the
one
from
whom
the
others--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
frey,
let
me
interrupt
you
right
there
if
i
may.
do
you
think
that
interest
which
surely
is
a
strong
interest
would
be
strong
enough
so
the
district
court
could
adopt
a
local
rule,
say
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
something
like
that,
that
in
all
cases
of
multiple
defendants
we
will
insist
on
separate
representation
for
every
client.
we
just
will
not
bother
with
these
hearings
because
it
is
so
hard
to
get
the
right
answer.
unknown
speaker
assume
it
is
within
the
rule
making
power
of
the
court.
would
it
be
a
valid
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
not
go
quite
as
far
as
the
rule
i
proposed.
it
sets
up
a
procedure
but
it
does
not
say
you
must
always
answer
the
question--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
not
true
that
there
are
some
cases
where
you
have
four
defendants
and
there
is
no
conflict
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you
then
have
to
appoint
four
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
i
at
one
time
represented
nine
defendants,
and
i
did
not
have
any
trouble.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
get
back
to
the
appealability
matter
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
hope
so.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
can
do
it
on
your
own
time.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
nonappealability?
we
should
vacate?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
no
decision
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
until
later.
unknown
speaker
because
of
conviction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
rule
44
refers
to
conflict
of
interest
without
really
defining
it
in
any
greater
length.
would
it
be
the
government's
position
that
even
if
the
kind
of
specific
potential
for
conflict
found
by
the
district
court
and
summarized
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
not
exist
there
was
a
potential
for
conflict
under
the
provisions
of
rule
44
every
time
you
have
joint
representation
because
of
the
difficulty
of
individual
plea
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
because
of
your
discussion
of
it.
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
you
mentioned
it.
unknown
speaker
don't
blame
it
on
mr.
frey.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
that
virtually
rules
out
joint
representation.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
district
court
said
no
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
should
never
reverse
for
an
abuse
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
so
any
district
court
that
wanted
to
just
disqualify
across
the
board
would
never
reverse.
unknown
speaker
what
about
four
defendants
above
the
indigency
line
but
not
too
much
above
it?
i
suspect
there
are
lots
of
times
they
can
affect
some
savings
if
they
retain
a
firm
for
joint
representation.
that
does
not
strike
me
as
an
ethically
unworthy
goal.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
obstacle
except
human
nature.
three
lawyers
do
not
always
think
alike.
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
serious
consequences?
unknown
speaker
no
one
is
saying
there
should
never
be
disqualification
in
joint
representation,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
government's
position
it
is
fair
to
say
there
can
never
be
joint
representation
if
the
district
court
says
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
what
can
the
district
judge
to
in
this
case?
of
course,
he
has
disqualified
him.
assuming
he
let
the
lawyer
represent
one
of
the
four
on
the
theory
that
you
do
not
have
to
all
get
out
and
the
other
three
say
"well,
i'll
exercise
my
faretta
rights.
"
and
just
assume
that
generally
that
the
lawyer
for
the
one
defendant
will
keep
things
in
hand.
is
there
any
way
that
the
judge
can
prevent
that
so
that
there
would
end
up
with
being
just
one
lawyer
on
the
defense
side
of
the
table?
unknown
speaker
it
might
lead
to
some
very
severe
problems
of
severance
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
or
a
mistrial
of
the
entire
case.
