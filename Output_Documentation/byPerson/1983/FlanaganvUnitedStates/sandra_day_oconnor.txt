justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
petitioners,
four
philadelphia
police
officers,
were
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
conspiring
to
deprive
citizens
of
their
civil
rights
and
for
committing
substantive
civil
rights
offenses.
the
petitioners
had
retained
a
certain
law
firm
to
act
as
their
joint
counsel.
the
government
moved
to
disqualify
the
law
firm
from
its
multiple
representations
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
after
noting
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
section
1291
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
because
the
disqualification
order
was
appealable
prior
to
trial
as
a
collateral
order.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
holding
and
hold
that
the
disqualification
order
was
not
immediately
appealable
under
section
1291,
and
hence
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
review
the
order
prior
to
entry
of
final
judgment
in
the
case.
there
is
a
strong
policy
against
piecemeal
appellate
review
of
trial
court
orders
and
decisions
made
before
the
final
termination
of
a
criminal
case
in
the
trial
court.
the
order
of
disqualification
of
counsel
does
not
fall
within
the
collateral
order
exception
to
the
final
judgment
rule.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
