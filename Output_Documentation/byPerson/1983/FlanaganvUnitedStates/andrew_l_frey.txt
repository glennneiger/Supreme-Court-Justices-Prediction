mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
first
by
way
of
background
to
ask
that
the
court
in
thinking
about
disqualification
issues
keep
in
mind
that
joint
representation
of
codefendants
is
not
the
only
context
in
which
this
issue
can
arise.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
a
defense
lawyer
can
be
disqualified
including
a
successive
representation
situation
where
the
lawyer
formally
represented
a
person
who
is
now
a
prosecution
witness,
situations
where
the
lawyer
formally
was
a
prosecutor
who
had
some
arguable
connection
with
the
investigation
that
led
to
the
indictment
of
his
now
client,
situations
where
the
third
party
is
paying
the
fees
and
exercising
some
degree
of
control
over
the
representation
of
the
defendant,
and
even
we've
seen
cases
where
there
is
the
lawyer's
potential
involvement
in
the
underlying
offense
or
his
potential
role
as
a
witness
which
may
call
for
his
disqualification.
now
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
now
about
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
come
back
to
it
later
if
i
have
time.
i
think
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
if
i
was
told
that
we
could
win
only
one
of
the
two
issues
in
this
case
we
would
rather
win
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
lose
the
merits
issue.
now
the
reason
for
this
position
is
the
potentially
devastating
effects
of
delay
in
criminal
prosecutions
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
in
cobbledick,
dibella,
hollywood
motor
cars
and
other
cases
in
which
it
has
turned
down
interlocutory
defense
appeals.
this
case
illustrates
the
potential
damage.
the
alleged
victims
in
this
case
are
street
people
who
are
hard
to
locate...
we
hope
we
will
still
be
able
to
locate
them...
who
are
hard
to...
whose
will
to
testify
against
the
police
when
they
have
to
go
back
on
the
street
again
is
sometimes
hard
to
nerve
them
up.
there
are
problems
that
are
caused
by
the
delay
in
this
and
in
other
cases,
and
those
problems
are
an
important
part
of
the
reason
why
in
criminal
cases
it
is
only
on
the
strongest
most
compelling
kind
of
showing
that
the
court
should
permit
a
pretrial
appeal.
there
is
also
i
might
add--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
justice
o'connor
asked
that
of
my
colleague,
and
i
think
the
answer
is
clearly
that
would
not
be
appealable.
the
reason
that
would
not
be
appealable
is
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
automatic
reversal
for
a
faretta
violation.
that
is
the
kind
of
violation
that
does
not
call
for
an
analysis
of
specific
prejudice
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
therefore,
it
would
be
treated
as
effectively
reviewable
on
appeal
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
meet
one
of
the
requirements
of
interlocutory
appeal.
so
i
would
say
that
that,
or
we
have
situations
where
a
defendant
seeks
appointment
of
counsel
claiming
that
he
is
indigent
and
is
denied
by
the
district
court.
he
may
be
forced
to
proceed
the
trial
without
an
attorney
if
he
is
unwilling
to
pay
himself.
i
assume
that
that
would
be
reviewed
after
final
judgment.
if
that
determination
were
erroneous
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
a
reversal
of
his
conviction
and
a
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
should
not
have
been
disqualification.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--our
argument
in
this
court
is
that
there
would
not
automatically
be
a
new
trial.
this
is
not
the
same
as
saying
as
my
colleague
suggests
that
the
appellant
would
have
to
show
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
as
though
the
disqualification--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
true
of
any
pretrial
ruling
that
turns
out
not
to
have
been
prejudicial.
it
may
not
get
review.
that
alone
cannot
be
enough
to
justify
an
interlocutory
appeal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
i
think
favor
the
opposite,
the
result.
[laughter]
i
think
the
answer
to
this
problem
is
not
to
allow
interlocutory
appeal.
you
may
conclude
and
this
is
all
tied
into
an
assessment
of
how
important
this
right
is
which
is
one
of
the
relevant
factors
and
that
is
why
i
want
to
get
to
the
merits
shortly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
true
although
if
it
were
a
per
se
bar
against
disqualification,
for
instance,
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
it
would
hardly
ever
come
up.
i
think
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
the
conclusion
if
you
find
that
the
effect
of
the
error
is
not
reviewable
because
you
cannot
assess
it
on
appeal
is
that
you
give
a
reversal
and
a
new
trial.
that
is
what
is
done
in
a
case
like
guiterrez,
for
instance,
with
the
overnight
continuance
during
which
the
defendant
was
barred
from
consulting
with
his
counsel.
once
you
find
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
impairment,
erroneous
impairment
of
a
right
and
it
is
not
possible
to
assess
its
impact
on
a
trial
then
you
may
order
a
reversal.
now
we
say
that
we
think
that
that
is
not
necessary,
but
i
must
say
that
i
would
prefer
the
conclusion
that
there
be
an
automatic
reversal
if
the
disqualification
order
is
erroneous
to
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
should
be
permitted
to
take
a
pretrial
appeal.
i
wanted
to
mention
in
that
connection
that
i
do
not
suggest
that
that
is
all
true
in
this
case,
but
this
business
is
subject
to
manipulation
by
defendants
who
want
to
buy
continuances
and
who
can
retain
attorneys
who
have
conflicts
of
interest.
they
will
get
disqualified
and
then
the
defendant
will
have
six
months
or
a
year
extra
before
he
goes
to
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
an
obvious
question
in
this
situation.
our
first
motive
in
this
situation,
and
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
cases.
the
joint
representation
case
looks
on
the
surface
at
least
as
though
the
concern
is
with
the
defendant's
interests,
and
it
may
look
somewhat
paternalistic,
but
we
may
want
to
disqualify
defense
counsel
because
is
going
to
use
privileged
information
to
cross
examine
a
prosecution
witness,
because
he
is
breaching
his
own
duty
to
us
as
a
former
government
attorney.
but
even
in
the
case
of
joint
representation
our
first
and
most
obvious
interest,
the
government
qua
prosecutor
qua
adversary
in
the
case,
is
that
we
must
have
a
waiver
and
as
good
a
waiver
as
we
can
get
in
order
to
insulate
any
conviction
that
we
have
from
collateral
attack.
secondly,
in
this
case
what
happened
essentially
was
we
brought
the
matter
before
the
district
court
by
the
motion.
the
hearing
was
held,
and
the
district
court
took
the
ball
and
ran.
i
am
here
today
i
think
not
just
representing
the
government
as
adversary
to
these
defendants
in
the
prosecution
but
also
representing
the
interests
of
the
court
which
saw
that
in
its
view
the
public
interest
was
not
satisfied
by
allowing
lawyers
to
appear
before
and
in
this
joint
representation
situation
where
it
found
there
was
unethical
conduct
or
significant
potential
for
unethical
conduct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
may
indeed
be
easier
in
some
circumstances.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
harder
to
try
a
case
against
four
lawyers
than
against
one
in
terms
of
the
length
of
time
it
takes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
it
is
rather
odd.
it
is
rather
odd
to
say
that
it
should
be
all
right
for
the
defendants
to
all
be
represented
by
one
lawyer
in
order
to
keep
the
government
assuming
the
government
is
acting
in
good
faith
in
these
circumstances
from
offering
a
favorable
arrangement
for
one
of
the
defendants.
that
is
part
of
the
problem
that
is
build
into
the
joint
representation
is
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
lawyer
to
plea
bargain.
i
might
say
that
plea
bargaining
is
not
always
initiated
only
by
the
government.
it
can
be
initiated
by
the
defendant,
and
if
you
can
imagine
how
somebody
representing
four
defendants
in
a
situation
like
this
could
initiate
plea
bargaining
for
one
of
them
your
imagine
surpasses
mine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is
whether
there
is
an
interest
that
the
courts
may
serve
in
not
having
unethical
practice
occurring
in
their
courtroom,
and
the
question
is
also
whether
the
court
has
the
power
to
protect
the
defendant
who
is
not
necessarily
getting
advice
that
is
looking
only
to
his
interests.
he
is
certainly
not
getting
advice
from
somebody
who
is
solely
committed
to
his
interests.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
certainly
not
the
basis
of
the
disqualification
order
in
this
case
and
nobody
has
suggested
that
that
is...
that
is
simply
pointed
to
by
the
authorities
who
have
written
on
this
subject
as
one
of
the
problems
that
is
associated
with
joint
representation,
but
this
case
is
not...
the
problem
that
the
district
court
saw
had
nothing
to
do
with
plea
bargaining.
the
problem
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
these
defendants
had
potentially
inconsistent
defenses.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
assuming
flanagan
was...
i
mean
the
surmise
in
your
question
was
that
flanagan
was
the
person
whose
interests
they
were
principally
protecting
in
this
situation
because
he
was
the
one
who
was
in
the
most
exposed
position.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
sought
to
divorce
themselves
although
there
are
also
problems,
for
instance,
with
landis
because
some
of
these
charges
involve
dog
attacks
on
the
alleged
victims
and
landis
was
the
officer
who
controlled
the
dog.
he
was
the
one
who
had
the
involvement
so
that
he
also
stood
out
from
the
other
defendants.
my
view
on
thinking
about
the
question
of
the
total
disqualification
is
that
it
would
not...
it
is
valid
until
such
point
as
each
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
a
lawyer
committed
to
him,
with
his
own
lawyer.
at
that
point
they
may
choose
to
waive
their
attorney-client
privilege
having
to
validly
waive
it,
and
at
that
point
i
think
sprague
and
rubenstone
could
stay
in
the
case
for
one
of
the
defendants.
in
any
event
i
do
not
view
that
as
the
principle
problem
in
this
case,
and
we
never
sought
disqualification
for
all
until
the
district
court
suggested
it
and
asked
that
that
matter
be
briefed.
we
wanted
to
prohibit
multiple
representation,
that
is,
representation
of
all
defendants
by
one
lawyer.
let
me
come
back
to
this
question.
i
would
like
to
start
by
what
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
just
adopted
by
the
aba
the
comment
on
multiple
representation.
it
says
"the
potential
for
conflict
of
interest
in
representing
multiple
defendants
in
a
criminal
case
is
so
grave
that
ordinarily
a
lawyer
should
decline
to
represent
more
than
one
codefendant.
"
and
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
which
is
what
is
applicable
here
says
"the
lawyer
should
resolve
all
doubts
against
the
propriety
of
the
representation.
"
"a
lawyer
should
never
represent
in
litigation
multiple
clients
with
differing
interests.
"
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
raise
a
question
in
my
mind
only
about
the
rule
making
power
of
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
let
me
make
this
point.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
pennsylvania,
for
instance,
after
what
happened
in
cuyler
v.
sullivan
said
"we
don't
want
these
problems
any
more.
"
"we
are
going
to
pass
a
law
that
says
each
defendant
has
to
be
represented
by
a
separate
lawyer.
"
i
cannot
conceive
that
such
a
law
would
be
unconstitutional
although
that
is
i
think
what
the
petitioners'
argument
is
forced
to
assert.
in
this
case
we
do
have
a
law.
we
do
not
need
a
rule
for
the
district
court.
i
mean
we
have
rule
44(c).
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
my
hypothetical
statute
is
constitutional
then
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
say
that
a
statute
which
has
the
force
that
goes
so
far
as
to
say
the
judge
shall
make
an
inquiry
but
he
can
allow
the
multiple
representation
if
it
is
demonstrated
that
there
is
no
likelihood
that
a
conflict
will
arise.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
at
the
point
of
time
at
which--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--for
instance,
that
is
the
principle
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
the
problem
is
the
difficulty
of
prediction
in
this
area,
justice
marshall.
the
district
court
is
acting
prospectively
at
a
time--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
are
cases
in
which
it
may
happen.
it
may
happen
that
as
the
matter
plays
out
no
conflict
ever
emerges.
in
fact
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
case
that
it
was
not
saying
that
the
disqualification
could
be
based
on
mere
speculation,
but
that
in
this
case
there
was
either
an
actual
or
a
sufficiently
potential
conflict
as
to
support
for
the
disqualification
order.
obviously
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
that
restrict
or
practices
that
restrict
the
criminal
defendant's
right
to
choose
his
lawyer.
he
cannot
select
a
layman
or
a
disbarred
lawyer
to
represent
him.
he
cannot
select
a
lawyer
who
is
not
willing
to
represent
him,
for
instance,
one
who
believes
that
this
representation
will
be
unethical.
he
cannot
select
a
lawyer
who
is
not...
he
has
no
right
to
have
a
lawyer
who
is
not
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
court.
he
has
not
right
to
have
a
continuance
in
order
to
be
represented
by
a
particular
lawyer
if
the
court
otherwise
justifiably
determines
that
the
trial
must
go
forward.
most
importantly
for
this
case
he
has
no
right
of
indigent
to
choose
his
own
lawyer
except
in
this
very
remote
sense
that
he
might
persuade
somebody
to
do
it
for
nothing.
i
think
that
was
fairly
clear
from
morris
v.
slappy.
in
my
mind
it
is
very
difficult...
this
would
be
the
only
sixth
amendment
right
i
have
ever
heard
of
that
is
available
not
to
indigents
but
only
to
nonindigents.
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
nature
of
the
right
is
more
of
a
fifth
amendment
due
process
kind
of
a
right
to
be
able
to
choose
your
lawyer
which
is
subject
to
reasonable
regulation.
it
cannot
be
arbitrarily
interfered
with.
i
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
here
there
is
not
an
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
interference.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
hope
so,
but
if
you
prefer
i
am
happy
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--my
own
time
may
not
get
me
to
it
so
let
me
get
back
to
it
now
since
you
are
interested
in
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
vacate
and
remand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
no
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
decision
on
the
merits
by
the
district
court.
there
would
be
no
review
of
the
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
until
later,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
there
is
a
conviction,
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
am
not
sure
that
that
factor
alone...
there
is
much
more
than
plea
bargaining.
i
hate
to
have
you
fix
your
mind
on
that
one
aspect.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
was
asked
about
that
by
justice
o'connor
which
is
why
i
discussed
it.
[laughter]
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
my
opinion
is
that
the
rule
gives
the
district
court
broad
discretion
in
a
situation
of
joint
representation
and
that
it
would
be
the
extraordinary
case
in
which
an
appellate
court
could
find
that
disqualifying
a
lawyer
in
that
circumstance
would
be
an
abuse
of
that
discretion.
in
fact
the
rule
says
that
unless
it
appears
that
there
is
good
cause
to
believe
that
no
conflict
of
interest
is
likely
to
arise
the
court
shall
take
such
measures
as
may
be
appropriate.
from
the
advisory
committee
notes
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
they
contemplated
that
the
appropriate
measures
included
disqualification,
and
it
is
hard
indeed
in
this
situation
to
think
of
much
else
that
would
be
an
alternative
to
deal
with
the
problem.
so
i
do
think
there
is
broad
discretion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
the
district
court
can
permit
joint
representation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
rarely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
all
the
ethical
propriety
of
joint
representation
is
tenuous
in
the
best
of
circumstances
it
seems
to
me.
we
are
concerned
about
the
adequacy
of
the
waivers
that
we
get
in
terms
of
our
interest
as
prosecutor,
our
selfish
interest
rather
than
our
broader
interest
in
the
administration
of
the
system.
we
have
a
waiver
here
in
this
case,
but
the
problems
with
waivers...
we
know
that
if
there
is
a
conviction
there
will
be
an
attack
on
that
waiver
in
an
effort
to
set
the
conviction
aside
on
the
basis
of
the
joint
representation
because
it
happens
repeatedly,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
with
waivers.
obviously
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
lay
defendant
to
appreciate
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
multiple
representation.
the
advice
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
go
with
one
lawyer
or
multiple
lawyers
is
given
by
a
conflict-ridden
attorney
who
may
himself
have
a
pecuniary
interest
in
continuing
the
joint
representation.
it
may
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
defendant
to
say
in
open
court
i
want
my
own
lawyer.
there
are
tremendous
pressures
operating
on
him,
and
this
is
not
necessarily
typical
of
the
cases
that
we
are
concerned
about.
we
have
narcotics
cases
frequently
where
there
are
major
and
minor
offenders
being
represented
by
the
same
lawyer
or
where
the
lawyer
is
being
paid
by
someone
in
the
background.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
it
is...
from
the
standpoint
of
the
clients
they
may
have
an
interest
in
saving
money,
but
i
do
not
think
when
weighed
against
all
of
the
other
interests
that
are
at
stake
that
the
court
can
assert
that
they
have
this
constitutional
right
to
conflict-ridden
counsel
which
is
the
claim
in
this
case.
they
should
at
least
be
advised
at
the
outset
by
their
own
lawyers.
now
one
thing
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
is
that
there
is
no
obstacle
to
mounting
a
common
defense,
and
there
is
no
obstacle
after
consultation
each
with
their
own
lawyer
to
giving
the
lead
role
to
one
of
the
lawyers
and
accomplishing
many
of
the
same
efficiencies
to
which
you
refer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
human
nature
is,
but
part
of
the
problem
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
human
nature
in
terms
of
what
the
position
of
these
defendants
is.
i
do
not
mean
these
as
individuals,
but
you
have
to
consider
the
class
of
defendants
who
are
subject
to
multiple
representation.
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
for
us
to
have
a
defendant
come
in
to
us
and
say
i
would
like
to
talk
to
you
about
cutting
a
deal
but
don't
tell
my
lawyer.
this
is
no
a
joke
because
telling
his
lawyer
could
have
very
serious
consequences
in
some
instances.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
can
have
fatal
consequences
because
the
lawyer
is
often
nominally
his
lawyer
but
actually...
as
i
say
this
is
not
this
case
at
all
but
it
is
a
class
of
circumstances
that
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
with
he
waiver.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
may
come
close
to
saying
that
if
the
district
court...
that
is
i
think
the
decision
that
underlies
rule
44(c)
which
is
designed
not
if
a
conflict
actually
exists
but
if
there
is
any
possibility
or
likelihood
that
a
conflict
will
arise.
now
if
you
had...
there
are
cases
in
which
it
can
be
imagined
where
the
likelihood
of
conflict
is
a
great
deal
less
than
in
this
case
and
where
joint
representation
might
be
permitted,
and
i
think
the
district
court
could
take
into
account
in
dealing
with
people
just
above
the
indigency
line,
the
kinds
of
economies
that
you
are
concerned
about
in
deciding
when
it
is
dealing
with
a
potential
conflict
in
assessing
how
serious
it
is.
it
has
the
discretion
to
do
this.
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
is
except
that
the
principles
of
the
bar
are
very
much
against
this
kind
of
representation
of
trying
to
serve
people
who
may
have
conflicting
interests
at
the
same
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
suppose
if
the
judge...
i
mean,
my
first
reaction
to
that
question
is
that
the
judge
probably
could
not
prevent
that
although
he
would
then
have
to
make
special
efforts
to
try
to
get
them
to
explain
or
make
sure
that
they
understand
that
at
least
they
can
consult
with
a
lawyer
after
which
they
may
choose
to
go
forward
with
their
joint
defense,
but
it
would
be
quite
strange
for
them
to
be
even
unwilling
to
talk
to
another
lawyer.
now
there
is
the
problem
in
these
cases
of
the
figure
behind
the
arras,
the
third
party
paying
the
fees,
and
that
is
a
factor
in
this
case.
the
fee
is
being
paid
by
a
third
party.
there
is
no
assurance
that
if
one
of
these
defendants
wished
to
cooperate
with
the
government
that
their
fees
would
any
longer
be
paid.
that
was
not
the
ground
of
the
disqualification
in
this
case,
but
it
is
a
source
of
concern
in
many
of
these
conflict
cases.
also
we
have
another
interest
because
my
colleague
said
that
if
in
the
course
of
a
trial
a
conflict
emerged,
a
actual
conflict,
he
would
naturally
have
to
disqualify
himself.
well,
we
have
an
interest
in
not
having
that
happen
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
and
the
district
court
has
an
interest
in
not
having
that
happen
in
the
middle
of
a
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
might
lead
to
severe
problems
of
severance.
it
might
lead
to
having
to
retry
a
case
that
may
have
gone
on
four
or
five
weeks.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
that
is
probably
what
it
would
lead
to
if
you
had
one
lawyer
in
this
situation.
there
is
no
way
to
prevent
as
you
mentioned
earlier
the
claim
later
on
that
the
waiver
of
conflict
free
counsel
was
either
coerced
or
not
intelligent
or
the
product
of
ineffective
assistance
on
the
part
of
the
lawyer
with
the
conflict
of
interest.
it
is
impossible
to
predict
what
will
occur
during
the
trial,
and
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
judge
who
knows
the
detail
of
neither
the
prosecution's
case
nor
the
defense
case
to
be
the
agency
for
making
sure
that
the
defendants
really
appreciate
the
risks.
even
defense
counsel
cannot
necessarily
appreciate
the
risks
because
they
do
not
know
what
the
government's
evidence
xx--
this
concern
about...
i
mean
it
is
said
here
that
this
is
nothing
but
a
potential
conflict.
there
is
no
actual
conflict.
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
conflict.
yet
here
we
have
a
situation
where
flanagan
was
out
on
the
street.
according
to
the
severance
motion
the
other
three
defendants
were
in
places
of
hiding
from
which
they
could
not
see
what
was
happening.
they
responded
only
to
flanagan's
signal
and,
therefore,
they
could
not
be
accused
of
having
illegally
arrested
the
victims
in
this
case.
yet
i
understand
that
in
other
court
proceedings
these
same
people
have
testified
that
they
were
in
a
position
to
see
flanagan
being
mugged
by
the
victims.
now
from
flanagan's
standpoint
that
is
much
better
evidence
if
that
could
be
and
would
be
their
testimony.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
other
three
defendants
it
is
obviously
much
better
that
they
were
off
around
the
corner
and
could
not
see.
now
i
do
not
know
how
one
lawyer
develops
a
strategy
that
deals
with
this.
in
the
charges
of
assaults
in
these
cases
the
witnesses
may
be
able
to
clearly
identify
some,
poorly
identify
others
and
not
at
all
identify
yet
others.
how
does
one
lawyer
represent
all
these
defendants
fairly?
now
the
question
is...
i
think
part
of
the
argument
is
well
maybe
he
cannot
but
the
defendants
have
the
right
to
waiver
their
right
to
fair
and
effective
representation,
conflict-free
representation.
now
this
question
came
up
before.
where
does
this
right
to
have
a
lawyer
come
from?
where
did
the
faretta
right
come
from?
the
faretta
right
came
from
the
sixth
amendment,
but
it
did
not
the
court
said
come
from
the
assistance
of
counsel
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
this
situation
is
really
like
singer.
you
have
a
right
to
conflict-free
counsel.
it
does
not
mean
that
you
have
the
right
to
insist
on
counsel
burdened
with
a
conflict
of
interest.
i
do
not
think
in
short
that
the
right
that
we
are
talking
about
is
a
right
of
such
a
magnitude
that
it
overrides
the
normal
principles
that
govern
the
practice
of
law.
the
small
restriction
on
the
eligibility...
this
is
essentially
an
eligibility
requirement
that
rule
44(c)
has
allowed
the
district
court
to
impose
upon
lawyers
practicing
in
the
district
that
they
not
undertake
representation
where
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
or
a
potential
conflict
of
interest.
i
do
not
see
how
that
small
additional
restriction
can
raise
a
serious
constitutional
problem.
thank
you.
