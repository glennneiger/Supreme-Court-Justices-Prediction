mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
some
40
years
ago
in
adams
v.
united
states
this
court
cautioned
that
the
procedural
safeguards
provided
to
an
accused
by
the
constitution
must
not
be
turned
into
fetters
and
recognized
that
to
deny
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
exercise
of
his
free
choice
the
right
to
dispense
with
the
constitutional
safeguards
which
have
been
provided
for
his
protection
is
to
imprison
a
man
in
his
privileges
and
call
it
the
constitution.
if
the
decisions
below
disqualifying
petitioners'
counsel
of
choice
from
presenting
their
common
defense
at
trial
are
permitted
to
stand,
the
caution
so
perceptively
expressed
by
justice
frankfurter
will
become
a
reality.
this
court
has
repeatedly
confirmed
both
the
propriety
and
the
efficacy
of
multiple
representation
in
criminal
matters.
this
court
has
never
questioned
the
right
of
persons
accused
of
crimes
jointly
to
present
their
common
defense
through
counsel
of
their
choice,
and
this
court
has
expressly
recognized
that
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
determine
the
manner
in
which
his
case
shall
be
conducted.
if
the
decisions
below
are
permitted
to
stand
these
precepts
will
not
survive
in
any
meaningful
form.
this
case
presents
in
the
clearest
possible
terms
the
question
of
whether
four
police
officers
jointly
charged
will
be
permitted
to
determine
that
they
wish
to
have
their
defense
presented
by
one
lawyer
in
whom
they
have
great
trust
and
great
confidence,
that
they
have
the
right
to
determine
that
the
one
lawyer
shall
present
a
common
defense,
and
that
their
decision
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
their
positions
are
completely
and
totally
consistent
and
that
each
is
willing
to
waive
their
rights
to
separate
counsel.
in
this
case
four
police
officers
learned
in
the
spring
of
1981
from
newspaper
articles
that
they
were
under
investigation.
they
were
under
investigation
by
various
federal,
local
and
police
authorities.
they
were
confronted
with
this
tangle
of
legal
complexities.
civil
and
criminal
potential
was
facing
them,
and
they
made
the
decision
at
that
time
to
come
to
the
firm
of
sprague
and
rubenstone,
in
particular
to
come
to
the
firm
because
of
the
firm's
senior
partner,
richard
sprague,
who
is
a
highly
skilled
and
experienced
defense
lawyer.
they
came
to
the
firm
and
they
said
to
the
firm
"we
are
coming
to
you
as
a
group.
"
"we
have
common
interests
and
we
want
you
to
protect
them.
"
after
they
came
each
of
the
defendants
was
interviewed
individually,
and
it
was
determined
as
a
result
of
these
individual
interviews
that
the
facts
which
they
related
were
not
inculpatory
to
them,
were
not
inculpatory
to
any
other
defendant
and
indeed
were
consistent
among
themselves.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
these
facts,
your
honor,
did
not
come
out
during
the
course
of
the
district
court
proceedings.
they
are
set
forth
in
our
appeal
brief.
they
are
set
forth
in
the
brief
to
this
court.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
they
have
never
been
found,
but
i
do
not
believe
they
are
disputed
by
anyone.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
but
there
are
no
inculpatory
facts
which
the
clients
represent.
the
clients
profess
innocence,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
no,
i
must
assume
the
possibility
with
all
due
respect
that
there
may
be
evidence
which
the
government
believes
demonstrates
wrongdoing,
but
i
need
not
assume
that
there
will
be
evidence
of
guilt
nor
need
i
assume
in
making
my
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
i
can
represent
all
four
that
anything
they
tell
me
is
incorrect
unless
i
have
something
to
present
me
with
a
doubt.
in
this
entire
proceeding
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
since
the
time
of
the
rule
44
disqualification
hearing
right
up
to
today
there
has
been
not
one
shred
of
evidence,
not
one
piece
of
information
presented
by
the
government
which
gives
any
claim
to
any
assertion
that
they
might
make
that
there
is
anything
inconsistent
as
between
the
stories
which
the
defendants
tell.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
would
be
happy
to
discuss
that
right
now.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
let
me
turn
to
it
very
quickly.
the
decision
to
disqualify
counsel
is
a
final
and
irrevocable
decision.
it
has
an
immediate
and
an
intense
impact
upon
the
trial.
it
has
an
immediate
and
intense
impact
upon
the
defendants
and
every
action
which
they
take
during
the
entire
course
of
the
trial,
and
it
destroys
ultimately
and
utterly
the
defendants'
right
to
counsel
at
the
most
critical
stage
of
his
life.
as
a
result
to
use
the
language
of
cohen,
the
decision
to
disqualify
counsel
is
too
important
and
too
independent
to
defer
review.
now
if
we
turn
to
the
specific
test
which
was
laid
out
in
cohen
and
in
cooper
i
think
it
is
clear
that
of
the
three-prong
test
for
appealability
as
a
collateral
order
the
disqualification
of
counsel
decision
meets
the
first
two.
it
is
a
decision
which
conclusively
determines
the
question,
and
it
is
a
decision
which
is
totally
separate
and
apart
from
any
question
involving
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
the
only
area
which
i
think
does
raise
some
discussion
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
decision
to
disqualify
counsel
is
effectively
reviewable.
seven
circuits
have
passed
on
this
issue
both
in
the
criminal
and
in
the
civil
context,
and
each
of
them
has
rejected
the
argument
that
such
a
decision
is
effectively
reviewable.
basically
every
court
including
the
ninth
circuit
which
has
said
that
this
is
not
an
order
which
is
appealable
in
an
interlocutory
fashion
has
said
any
attempt
to
prove
prejudice
by
a
defendant
who
has
his
counsel
denied
to
him
at
the
inception
of
the
case
would
be
an
insurmountable
burden
and
we
cannot
imagine
any
way
that
he
could
go
about
showing
that,
meeting
that
burden.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
greger,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
do
have
a
difficulty
with
per
se
reversal
because
there
is
too
much
which
can
occur
during
the
course
of
a
trial
which
is
not
reversable.
there
is
too
much
that
can
occur
during
the
course
of
a
trial
which
is
irremediable
and
which
is
denied
to
a
defendant
if
he
is
forced
to
go
to
trial
with
counsel
other
than
his
choice.
for
example,
at
a
trial,
the
first
trial,
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
testify.
now
subsitute
counsel
may
be
competent,
but
he
may
not
be
the
counsel
that
the
defendant
selects,
and
his
ability
to
direct
or
cross
examine
that
witness
may
not
be
the
same
level
as
the
ability
of
counsel
of
choice.
likewise
the
strategy
or
the
tactics
which
he
might
adopt
in
cross
examining
or
direct
examining
that
witness
may
have
been
different
and
may
have
been
injurious
to
the
interests
of
that
defendant.
now
if
that
witness
is
subsequently
unavailable
his
testimony
is
admissible
in
the
event
of
a
retrial,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
prejudice.
the
very
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defendant
will
testify
may
be
made
one
way
by
counsel
of
choice,
may
be
made
the
exact
opposite
way
by
substitute
counsel.
if
substitute
counsel
decides
to
put
that
man
on
the
stand
and
have
him
testify
then
his
testimony
is
going
to
be
forever
etched
in
stone,
and
that
will
not
be
reversable.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
yes,
especially
if,
as
has
occurred
in
this
case,
the
district
court
entered
a
stay.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
necessarily
an
automatic
stay
as
a
result
of
an
appeal
under
1291.
somebody
has
got
to
stay
the
proceedings,
and
i
think
that
at
that
point
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
discretion
in
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
matter
which
does
require
review
or
whether
this
is
a
matter
which
is
frivolous.
we
do
it
in
the
double
jeopardy
situation
all
the
time.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor,
but
i
would
imagine
that
if
a
state--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--i
would
think
so.
i
mean
if
the
state
or
federal
government
would
refuse
to
provide
counsel
to
an
indigent
in
connection
with
his
criminal
defense
i
would
imagine--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--well,
what
i
am
saying
is
really
just
the
flip
side
of
the
gideon
situation
where
the
government
does
not
comply
with
gideon.
this
court
has
found
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
and
that
that
right
cannot
be
impinged
upon
absent
extreme
circumstances.
so
i
think
there
would
be
absolutely
a
right
to
take
the
appeal,
but
i
am
aware
of
no
cases
that
have
raised
that
issue.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
no.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
no.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
at
all.
i
believe,
and
maybe
i
made
an
improper
assumption,
but
i
believe
that
the
denial
of
the
right
to
represent
one's
self
following
the
faretta
decision
would
have
the
same
effect
and
would
meet
the
same
criteria
as
are
set
down
in
cohen
and
as
this
court
has
accepted
for
an
interlocutory
appeal.
so
i
think
it
would
be
appealable
under
1291.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
just
because
there
is
a
constitutional
right
that
there
is
automatically
a
right
to
appeal.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
do
believe.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
the
defendant--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--of
course,
he
can.
but
how
can
he...
he
can
raise
the
issue--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--well,
but
there
has
been
no
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
other
than
the
ninth
circuit
decision
that
says
that
if
you
prove
that
the
denial
of
counsel
of
choice
was
erroneous
you
are
automatically
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
the
other
courts
which
have
addressed
this
question
have
all
said
that
you
have
got
to
show,
we
believe,
in
order
to
get
a
new
trial
you
have
got
to
show
some
prejudice
and
because
that
showing--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--it
is
hard
to
answer
that
question
directly
so
let
me
try
it
this
way.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
the
cohen
court
does
not
say
otherwise
reviewable.
it
says
effectively
reviewable.
that
to
me
means
that
the
defendant
essentially
has
to
be
in
the
position
to
be
put
back
in
the
same
place
he
was
if
he
had
had
the
right
to
take
that
appeal
and
get
the
relief
immediately.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
absolutely.
indeed
the
government's
position
in
this
issue
is
that
you
do
not
really
even
look
at
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
an
erroneous
disqualification
or
not.
that
question
is
subsumed
to
a
much
more
significant
question
according
to
the
government
of
whether
or
not
you
have
got
effective
assistance.
if
you
have
got
effective
assistance--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--which
position,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
absolutely.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
find
it
in
the
sixth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--no,
i
believe
that
the
sixth
amendment...
inherent
in
the
sixth
amendment
if
not
implicit
and
inherent
in
our
society
is
the
right
of
an
individual
defendant
to
select
who
he
wishes
to
represent
him
in
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
faretta
decided
that
the
individual
had
the
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
based
upon
the
sixth
amendment
assistance
of
counsel
clause.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
give
it
to
them,
your
honor.
i
think
they
have
it.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
that
is
correct
but
i
think
there
are
different
considerations,
the
consideration
being
that
here
you
are
imposing
upon
the
state
and
in
imposing
upon
the
state
your
rights
are
going
to
be
limited.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
of
choice
is
an
unlimited
right,
but
i
do
believe--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--it
is
a
right
to
choose.
it
is
a
right
to
choose
who
you
want
whether
you
are
a
millionaire
or
an
indigent.
the
fact
is
that
it
takes
two
to
tango.
the
fact
is
that
if
an
indigent
goes
up
to
edward
bennett
williams
who
charges
i
have
no
idea
for
his
services,
but
if
he
can
convince
edward
bennett
williams
that
his
case
is
interesting
enough
and
important
enough
mr.
williams
may
take
the
case.
so
i
think
the
focus
in
that
analysis
is
not
upon
the
individual's
right
to
choose.
the
indigent
has
the
right
to
choose
just
as
you
or
i
do,
but
the
question
is
will
his
choice
be
accepted
by
the
lawyer
who
is
going
to
provide
him
his
representation.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
well,
i
would
be
willing
to
take
any
help
i
can
get,
and
if
freedom
of
association
fits
into
this,
your
honor...
i
do
not
really
see
the
application
in
as
clear
a
sense
as
i
do
the
sixth
amendment.
i
believe
that
courts
have
the
right
to
impose
certain
limited
limitations
upon
the
right
to
counsel
of
choice,
and
if
i,
for
example,
decide
to
contract
for
representation
with
a
lawyer
from
another
state
or
a
lawyer
who
is
disbarred
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
the
right
to
insist
upon
that
he
be
permitted
to
represent
me.
but
within
certain
specified
general
limitations
i
do
believe
that
i
have
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
select
the
lawyer
of
my
choice
to
present
my
defense.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
yes,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
those
decisions,
for
example,
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial
or
the
denial
of
proper
notice
has
the
same
kind
of
irreversible
impact
that
denial
of
counsel
has.
denial
of
counsel
impacts
upon
the
entire
process.
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
does
not
do
that.
it
only
results
in
a
finding,
for
example,
and
if
the
denial
was
improper
the
remedy
is
simple,
a
new
trial.
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
the
two
both
as
to
their
nature
and
as
to
their
effect.
moving
past
the
facts
except
to
emphasize
that
the
defendants
all
expressed
both
before
and
after
the
indictment
that
it
was
their
intention
to
present
a
common
defense
through
one
lawyer,
and
the
attorney
likewise
made
a
decision
in
this
case.
he
decided,
our
firm
decided
that
it
was
proper
for
us
to
represent
those
defendants.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
would
it
foreclose
a
collateral
attack
on
the
conviction?
i
believe
that
the
waiver
proceeding
itself
forecloses
a
subsequent
attack
on
the
conviction
to
the
extent
that
any
matters
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
defendants
during
that
proceeding.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
my
answer,
your
honor,
was
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
hearing.
i
believe
that
the
hearing
serves
that
effect,
that
the
hearing
itself
in
front
of
the
court
on
the
record
effectively
bars
the
defendant
from
raising
at
a
subsequent
time
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
based
on
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
no.
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
in
the
federal
system
as
i
read
rule
44
the
judge
must
conduct
a
hearing
in
any
case
of
multiple
representation.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
discretionary
any
longer.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
yes.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
an
actual
conflict
of
interest
arises
at
any
point
in
the
proceeding
i
have
an
absolute
obligation
to
withdraw
from
representing
that
client.
i
believe
that
if
the
government
comes
and
makes
an
offer
which
the
client
accepts
that
i
can
likewise
no
longer--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--i
believe
that
i
misspoke
myself
just
a
moment
ago,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
go
as
far
as
i
did.
once
i
am
advised...
again,
during
the
trial,
before
the
trial.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
in
my
analysis...
once
i
am
approached
by
the
government
and
advised
that
they
wish
to
speak
to
one
of
my
clients
i
believe
i
have
an
obligation
to
advise
the
client
of
that
fact,
and
i
believe
i
have
a
duty
to
withdraw
from
any
discussions
relating
to
that
client
and
that
client's
discussions
with
the
government.
ifthe
discussions
are
successful
then--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--i
would
have
to
advise
the
client
to
get
separate
counsel
to
represent
him,
and
i
would
make
myself
available
to
him
to
relate
to
him
any
nonprivileged
information
i
might
have.
but
as
to
the
discussions
themselves
i
do
believe
that
my
involvement
would
put
me
in
a
conflict
situation.
now
if
the
discussions
fail,
if
there
was
no
agreement
reached
between
the
government
and
the
defendant
i
would
be
available
for
the
defendant
to
come
back
in
if
he
wishes
to
rejoin
the
common
defense.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
mean
to
quibble,
but
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
greater
exposure.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
believe
i
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
advise
him
of
my
analysis
and
to
advise
him
that
he
has
to
get
separate
counsel
to
have
those
discussions
with
the
government.
i
do
not
believe
i
could
represent
him
in
that
context.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
there
is
no
question.
i
would
never
suggest
for
a
moment
that
the
potential
for
problems...
i
do
not
even
want
to
use
the
word
"conflicts"
because
i
think
they
used
the
word
incorrectly
below...
the
potential
for
problems
are
always
present,
but
the
potential,
the
speculation--
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
--absolutely.
if
the
lower
court's
decisions
in
this
case
are
upheld
based
as
they
are
upon
what
the
lower
court
called
potential
conflicts...
and
i
will
use
that
word
for
the
purpose
of
this
moment...
if
that
decision
is
permitted
to
stand
then
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
can
never
be
multiple
representation
because
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
every
case
of
multiple
representation
inherent
in
it
is
a
potential
for
a
conflict.
all
that
the
lower
court
did
was
to
identify
the
potential,
to
ignore
the
waiver,
to
ignore
the
defendants'
professions
of
innocence,
to
ignore
the
defendants'
determination
to
present
a
common
defense
and
to
focus
on
the
potential
for
the
conflict.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
it
is
clear
to
me
from
my
experience
that
where
defendants
are
jointly
represented
there
is
a
lesser
likelihood
that
any
of
them
will
break
away
and
plead.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
absolutely.
but
i
think
that
there
is
even
a
more
significant
aspect
to
the
government's
position.
if
you
are
a
prosecutor
the
best
thing
to
happen...
if
you
are
a
plaintiff
in
a
civil
case
the
situation
that
you
want
to
create
is
fingerpointing.
if
you
can
create
fingerpointing,
if
you
can
create
inconsistencies,
if
you
can
create
disparities
then
you
can
sit
back.
your
job
is
more
than
halfway
done.
that
is
what
the
common
defense
prevents.
the
defendants'
decision
to
present
a
common
defense
especially
through
one
lawyer
where
there
is
not
even
going
to
be
inadvertent
consistencies
that
decision
severely
impacts
the
probability
of
the
government
ultimately
succeeding
in
getting
a
conviction.
i
am
not
suggesting
they
will
not,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
it
makes
their
job
harder.
so
i
do
think
the
government
has
an
interest
which
may
not
be
completely
objective
in
their
approach
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
i
have
no
problem
in
seeing
a
district
court
enter
a
disqualification
order
where
there
is
a
demonstrated
conflict.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
right.
let
me
just...
to
be
very
clear
a
lot
of
the
actual
conflict
cases
involving
disqualification
of
counsel
have
arisen
involving
third
parties
and
a
defendant.
there
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
essential
that
the
district
court
disqualify.
in
those
instances
i
think
rule
44
tells
the
district
court
to
take
appropriate
measures,
and
a
lot
of
the
circuits
have
gone
around
and
done
that.
for
example,
where
there
is
problems
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
of
a
prior
client,
the
second
circuit,
the
eight
circuit
has
said
"well,
let's
take
a
look
at
this.
"
"let's
see
what
this
involves.
"
"let's
see
if
it
really
does
impair
the
ability
of
the
defendant's
lawyer
to
cross
examine
or
maybe
let's
see
if
the
prior
client
will
waive.
"
they
have
gone
to
extremes
to
avoid
the
extreme
action
that
was
taken
by
the
court
in
this
case.
that
is
not
directly
analogous
here
obviously
because
it
involves
third
parties,
but
i
think
it
does
indicate
that
appropriate
measures
under
rule
44
is
not
some
kind
of
reflexive
disqualification
if
you
have
a
problem.
mr.
edward
h.
rubenstone
thank
you,
your
honor.
