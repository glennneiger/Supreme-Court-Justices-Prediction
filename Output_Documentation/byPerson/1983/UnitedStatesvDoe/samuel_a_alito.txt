mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
concerns
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
when
a
subpoena
is
issued
for
the
standard
business
records
of
a
sole
proprietorship.
a
federal
grand
jury
in
newark,
new
jersey,
was
investigating
corruption
in
the
awarding
of
county
and
municipal
contracts.
the
grand
jury
issued
five
subpoenas
for
the
records,
the
standard
business
records
of
sole
proprietorships
operated
by
respondent.
these
documents
included
records
such
as
general
ledgers,
bank
statements,
telephone
toll
records,
vouchers,
invoices,
in
other
words,
wholly
business
records,
and
the
sort
of
records
kept
by
virtually
every
business,
no
matter
what
its
size
or
form
of
organization.
when
respondent
argued
that
the
act
of
producing
these
records
would
tend
to
incriminate
him,
the
government
offered
in
exchange
for
receiving
the
records
not
to
use
the
act
of
production
against
him
in
any
way
in
any
subsequent
criminal
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
government
never
made
an
offer
of
statutory
immunity
for
a
number
of--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--for
at
least
two
principal
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
both
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
rejected
the
very
concept
of
act
of
production
immunity.
the
district
court
held
that
even
if
such
immunity
were
given
and
the
evidence
could
not
be
used
in
any
way
against
respondent
in
a
criminal
trial,
he
would
nevertheless
inevitably
be
incriminated
in
the
eyes
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
justice
o'connor,
our
position
is
that
the
non-statutory
constructive
act
of
production
immunity
that
was
offered
in
this
case
is
sufficient,
but
we
also
believe
that
statutory
immunity
would
be
available
for
the
act
of
production
and
would
also
be
sufficient
in
this
area,
and
if
the
court
were
to
make
clear
in
deciding
this
case
that
such
statutory
immunity
would
obviate
any
fifth
amendment
objection,
then
i
think
we
would
have
no
serious
objection
to
such
a
holding.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
believe
that
here,
as
in
fisher,
the
act
of
producing
the
documents
would
not
amount
to
testimonial
self-incrimination.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
one
of
our
submissions,
but,
justice
white,
we
are
not
interested
and
never
have
been
interested
in
the
act
of
production,
and
therefore
we
are
quite
happy
to
give
respondent
immunity
from
any
use--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
have
no
interest
in
using
the
act
of
production
in
evidence
or
any
evidence--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
are
interested
in
the
materials,
and
we
are
interested
in
the
issue
of
act
of
production
only
if
it
helps
us
get
the
materials.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
them,
but
i
think--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
certainly
was
a
claim,
and
a
colorable
claim.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
don't
withdraw
that
submission,
and
if
the
court
wishes
to
reach
that
before
reaching
the
issue
of
immunity--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
when
statutory
immunity,
for
example,
is
offered,
it
is
necessary
to
fully
adjudicate
the
legitimacy
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim
before
immunity
can
be
conferred,
and
i
would
suppose--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--when
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
claim,
i
believe
that
is
essentially
what
happens.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
my--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
is
our
submission.
i
think
that
because
the
lower
courts
found
the
colorable
claim,
the
immunity
issue
could
be
reached
first,
but
we
have
absolutely
no
objection
to
the
court
reaching
the
issue
of
self-incrimination
by
means
of
the
act
of
production
first,
because
we
firmly
believe
that
that
is
not
self-incriminating,
for
the
same
reasons,
as
in
fisher.
we
think
that
the
existence,
possession,
existence
and
possession
of
standard
business
records
is
not
testimonial,
and
does
not
pose
a
real
and
substantial
danger
of
self-incrimination
in
the
case
of
sole
proprietorships
just
as
that
is
true
in
the
case
of
corporations
and
partnerships.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
certainly,
in
special
circumstances
it
could,
but
it
is
up
to
the
claimant
of
the
privilege
to
make
it
appear
to
the
judge
that
those
circumstances
are
present.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
he
did,
but
we
would
submit
that
that
was
incorrect.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
we
draw
a
very
clear
distinction
between
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
is
our
submission,
and
i
think
it
is
crystal
clear
in
these
cases
that
the
practical
concern
of
the
witnesses
is
solely
the
contents
of
the
documents.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
is
abstractly
possible,
but
i
think
when
you
are
talking
about
standard
business
records,
the
kind
of
records
that
every
company
has,
that
it
will
seldom
be
the
case
that
the
act
of
production
will
amount
to
testimonial
self-incrimination.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
subpoenas
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
do
in
their
original
form.
they
are
redacted
in
the
petition.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
this
is
possible
in
certain
cases,
but
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
about
who
owns
these
companies.
when
this
case
was
first
argued
in
district
court,
respondent
came
in
and
said,
these
are
my
companies,
and
they
are
sole
proprietorships,
and
the
government
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
for
purposes
of
argument.
so
there
is
no
issue
here
about
who
owns
the
companies
and
who
is
in
control
of
the
records.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
if--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
they
could
easily
be
authenticated
by
numerous
other
means.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
would
have
to
authenticate
them
in
some
way
at
trial.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
would
be
sufficient
to
authenticate
them.
it
would
not--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
would
not
necessarily
be
sufficient
for
their
admission
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
you
do.
i
think
that
is
just
our
point.
authentication
is
not
a
substantial
barrier
under
modern
law
to
the
admission
of
standard
business
records,
and
it
is
essentially
a
fiction
to
argue
that
the
unprivileged
contents
of
these
records
should
be
blocked,
that
the
grand
jury's
access
to
these
unprivileged
contents
should
be
blocked
based
upon
this
largely
academic
argument
that
the
act
of
production
would
amount
to
tacit
authentication,
and
would
result
in
self-incrimination
of
the
sole
proprietorship.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
what
we
attempted
to
do,
justice
stevens.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
did
not
ask
for
statutory--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
district
judge
felt
that
our
immunity
offer
was
insufficient
because
he
believed
that
incrimination
in
the
eyes
of
the
grand
jury
was
sufficient
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
we
disagree
with
that,
and
for
that
reason,
he
disagreed
with
the
entire
concept.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
court
were
to
make
it
clear
that
we
could
do
that
on
remand,
we
would
be
entirely
satisfied.
we
believe
that
non-statutory
immunity
here
is
appropriate
because
of
the
special
circumstances
of
act
of
production,
but
if
the
court
were
to
make
it
clear
that
statutory
immunity
would
obviate
respondent's
fifth
amendment
claims,
that
would
be
wholly
satisfactory
to
us.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
it--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
was
certainly
the
logic
of
his
position.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
did
not
offer
statutory
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
did
not
offer
it
in
large
measure
because
it
was
unclear
that
either
of
the
courts
below
would
have
construed
an
offer
of
statutory
immunity
as
limited
to
the
act
of
production,
because
both
courts
felt
that
there
were
serious
problems
with
the
concept
of
act
of
production
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
retrospect,
justice
marshall,
it
might
have
been.
it
might
have
been
easier.
we
didn't--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
perhaps
i
am
not
making--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
act
of
producing
certain
documents
in
certain
situations
may
well
be
incriminating.
our
position
is
i
think
essentially
what
you
said
in
concurrence
in
fisher.
you
said
that
the
existence
of
corporate
records
is
not
in
doubt,
and
therefore
conceding
the
existence
and
possession
of
those
records
is
not
testimonial,
and
the
same
must
be
true
of
partnership
records
in
light
of
bellis,
and
we
would
argue
the
same
would
be
true
of
the
standard
business
records
of
a
sole
proprietorship.
there
simply
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
these
forms
of
business
units
on
this
ground.
if
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
corporations
have
general
ledgers,
for
example,
it
is
equally
a
foregone
conclusion,
i
would
submit,
that
a
sole
proprietorship
has
such
document,
and
the
logic
of
that
position
means
that
in
the
case
of
a
subpoena
for
standard
business
records,
regardless
of
the
form
of
company
involved,
this...
the
act
of
production
would
not
amount
to
testimonial
immunity...
it
would
not
amount
to
testimonial
self-incrimination.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
honoring
the
subpoena,
the
witness
is
not
vouching
for
the
accuracy
of
the
contents
of
the
documents.
he
is
simply
saying,
i
have
these
documents--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
there
is
some
question
about
whether
he
has
possession
of
the
documents,
then
i
suppose
the
act
of
production
would
be
incriminating,
but
in
the
case
of
standard
business
records,
where
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
company
has
those
records,
i
don't
think
it
amounts
to
testimonial
self-incrimination.
but
in
any
event,
that
was
not
the
point
that
i
intended
to
press
here
this
morning.
the
point
that
we
want
to
make
clear
is...
that
we
would
like
the
court
to
address
is
that
a
person
in
respondent's
position
has
no
basis
for
asserting
a
fifth
amendment
claim
based
on
the
act
of
production
when
act
of
production
immunity
is
tendered.
now,
if
that
argument
is
self-evident,
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
certainly
hope
so.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
many
of
the
lower
courts
have
had
difficulty
with
that
problem.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
contents
of
these
documents
were
privileged.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
is
the
principal
thing
that
we
want
reversed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.

[generallaughter.]
on
the
question
of
the
contents,
whether
the
contents
of
the
records
are
privileged,
we
are
really
asking
the
court
to
do
nothing
more
than
follow
its
reasoning
and
its
holding
in
fisher.
the
fifth
amendment,
the
court
has
held,
applies
only
when
a
witness
is
compelled
to
make
a
testimonial
communication
that
is
incriminating.
as
the
court
made
clear
in
fisher,
when
a
document
is
voluntarily
prepared
before
a
subpoena
is
issued,
obviously,
no
one
compels
the
production
of
the
document.
a
subpoena
that
is
later
issued
for
the
document
may
compel
the
witness
to
turn
over
the
document,
but
it
does
not
compel
the
witness
to
restate
or
reaffirm
the
contents
of
the
document,
and
therefore
the
contents
of
the
document
as
distinct
from
the
act
of
production
do
not
constitute
compelled
testimony,
and
they
fall
outside
the
privilege.
now,
i
would
quickly
add
that
there
are
undoubtedly
certain
highly
personal
documents...
a
diary
is
perhaps
the
best
example...
that
may
well
be
protected
by
other
provisions
of
law,
the
fourth
amendment
or
the
first
amendment,
but
not
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
which
applies
only
when
a
witness
is
compelled
to
make
a
testimonial
communication
that
is
incriminating.
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
attempted
to
distinguish
fisher
on
two
grounds,
authorship
and
ownership
of
the
papers,
and
we
think
neither
of
these
distinctions
make
sense
either
under
fisher's
reasoning
or
under
a
protection
of
privacy
rationale
taken
from
boyd.
under
fisher,
of
course,
what
matters
is
whether
the
documents
were
voluntarily
created,
not
who
created
them
and
not
who
owned
them.
fisher
expressly
rejected
the
idea
of
authorship
as
a
distinguishing
factor,
and
the
idea
of
ownership
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
claiming
the
privilege
had
earlier
been
rejected
in
couch,
where
the
court
wrote,
"to
tie
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
a
concept
of
ownership
would
be
to
draw
a
meaningless
line.
"
"it
would
make
the
privilege
turn
on
fine
distinctions
of
property
law.
"
even
under
a
protection
of
privacy
rationale
taken
from
boyd,
these
ideas
of
authorship
and
ownership
don't
make
sense.
a
person
may
well
have
a
far
greater
privacy
interest
in
a
document
he
did
not
write
than
in
one
he
did
write.
a
letter
written
by
a
relative
or
close
friend
may
be
far
more
private
to
the
witness
than
a
cancelled
check
that
he
himself
wrote
to
pay
last
month's
gas
bill.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
believe
that
certain
highly
private
documents
might
well
be
protected
by
other
provisions
of
law,
but
not
by
the
fifth
amendment,
and
insofar
as
boyd
stands
for
the
proposition
that
private
papers
voluntarily
created
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
that...
of
that
rule,
which,
as
we
tried
to
argue
in
our
brief
was
never
the
rule
of
boyd
in
the
first
place.
the
same
thing
that
is
true
for
authorship
is
true
for
ownership.
one
does
not
necessarily
have
a
greater
privacy
interest
in
something
that
one
owns
than
in
something
else.
a
diary
belonging
to
a
relative
or
close
friend
may
be
far
more
private
than
a
document
of
a
relatively
trivial
nature
belonging
to
the
witness
himself.
and
even
if
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
did
protect
private
papers,
as
justice
brennan
argued
in
his
concurrence
in
fisher,
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
most
of
the
documents
in
this
case
are
not
private
papers.
they
are
papers
of
a
wholly
business,
non-personal
nature,
and
they
are
not
papers
that
respondent
kept
private.
they
are
papers
that
were
exposed
to
other
persons
at
various
times.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
they
did,
justice
stevens.
if
you--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--on
14a
of
the
appendix,
gould,
which
is
one
of
their
prior
cases,
then
stands
for
the
proposition
that
an
individual's
business
papers
cannot
be
subpoenaed
by
a
grand
jury.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
fourteen

the
first

of
the
petition.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
gould
is
one
of
their
prior
cases.
gould
stands
for
the
proposition
that
an
individual's
business
papers
as
well
as
his
personal
records
cannot
be
subpoenaed
by
a
grand
jury,
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
which
they
discuss--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
are
continuing
to
discuss
their
holding
in
the
johansen
case,
which
held
that
the
contents
of
an
office
diary
were
protected
by
the
privilege,
and
they
extend
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
if
they
held
that
the
contents
are
privileged,
we
would
argue
that
they
are
wrong.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
did
not
hold
that,
then
i
think
it
was
certainly
not
clear
to
us--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
it
is
unclear,
and
certainly
respondent
believes
that
they
held
that
the
contents
are
privileged,
so--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--in
any
event,
our
position
is
then
that
the
contents
are
not
privileged,
and
the
only
issue
remaining
is
whether
our
offer
of
act
of
production
immunity
was
sufficient.
we
believe
that
non-statutory
act
of
production
immunity
here
was
adequate,
and
i
believe
that
our
position
finds
support
in
murphy
versus
waterfront
commission,
which
held
that
testimony
given
under
a
state
grant
of
immunity
may
not
be
used
in
any
other
jurisdiction,
including
in
federal
court.
this
means
in
effect
that
state
courts
are
empowered
to
give
non-statutory
federal
use
immunity.
no
federal
statute
confers
upon
them
the
authority
to
do
that,
and
their
state
statute,
i
would
think,
could
give
such
authority.
they
compelled
the
witness
over
objection
to
testify,
and
his
testimony
thereafter
is
automatically
immunized.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
federal
courts
to
do
this
in
the
limited
area
of
act
of
production
immunity.
on
the
government's
motion,
the
courts
would
order
witnesses
to
produce
documents
over
objection
if
the
act
of
production
would
be
incriminating,
and
the
act
of
production
thereafter
would
be
immunized.
this
would
be
essentially
what
takes
place
now,
when
state
courts
grant
immunity
under
their
own
statutes
or
procedures.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
don't
have
serious
objections
to
following
the
statutory
procedure,
but
we
don't
think
it
is
necessary.
we
think
the
non-statutory
procedure
is
more
convenient
since
subpoenas
for
documents
are
an
everyday
occurrence,
unlike
requests
for
testimonial
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
that
the
executive
has
the
authority
to
seek
the
admission
of
relevant
evidence.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
immunity
statute
that
rules
out
non-statutory
act
of
production
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
think
there
were
two
reasons
for
the
long
string
of
statutes
for
immunity
for
actual
testimony.
one
was
that
when
these
first
started
to
be
enacted
beginning,
i
think,
in
1863,
most
of
the
questions
that
have
now
been
answered
about
immunity
were
still
unanswered,
about
the
scope
of
immunity,
the
circumstances
in
which
a
witness
was
required
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
and
so
forth,
and
so
the
statutes
were
an
attempt
to
address
those
questions,
and
of
course
it
took
a
long
time
to
sort
out
the
answers.
the
other
reason
is
that
in
the
case
of
immunity
for
testimony,
at
least
the
procedures
that
have
almost
invariably
been
built
into
the
statute
worked
to
protect
the
government,
because
of
the
serious
taint
problems
that
can
arise
when
immunity
is
given
for
testimony.
the
statutes
require--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
don't
see--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
don't
think
he
is
in
any
more
uncertainty
than
he
is
when
a
state
court
orders
him
to
testify
under
a
state
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
would
have
serious
objection
in
that
case,
because--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--it
was
not
done
upon
our
motion.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
are
equally
in
control
whether
we
request
non-statutory
immunity
or
statutory
immunity.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
this
is
not
a
case
like
goldsbury
versus
convoy
last
term,
where
immunity...
where
the
court
was
asked
to
give
immunity
without
the
government's
participation.
we
asked
for
it
here.
there
is
no
question
of--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
district
court
judges
generally
do
not
require
the
attorney
general
to
appear
in
person
to--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--no,
but
my
point,
justice
white,
was
that
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
internal
management
in
the
justice
department.
in
any
event--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
would
submit
it
is
not
a
prediction
if
the
judge
orders
the
witness
to
testify
over
a
fifth
amendment
objection,
and
i
think
it
is
settled,
and
i
think
you
said
it
more
clearly
than
anyone
else
in
manness
versus
meyers,
that
the
testimony
thereafter
may
not
be
used.
in
fact
the
term
"functional
immunity"
was
taken
from
your
concurring
opinion
in
manness
versus
meyers.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
felt
that
under
third
circuit
precedent
especially
statutory
immunity
was
not
necessary
here,
but
as
i
said,
and
can't
make
too
clear,
we
think
the
important
question
is
the
principle
of
act
of
production
immunity,
and
if
the
court
were
to
make
it
clear
that
that
is
sufficient
in
a
case
like
this,
that
would
be
wholly
satisfactory.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
just
two
very
brief
points.
the
first
is
to
emphasize
that
in
this
case
we
are
not
asking
enforcement
of
the
subpoenas.
the
subpoenas
were
quashed
below,
and
if
the
court
were
to
vacate
that
decision
or
otherwise
make
clear
that
we
would
be
free
on
remand
to
grant
statutory
immunity,
our
interests
would
be
substantially
served.
and
the
second
point
is
just
a
point
of
clarification.
we
are
not
pressing
the
argument
of
non-statutory
immunity
in
the
case
of
immunity
for
testimony,
but
only
in
the
very
limited
area
of
act
of
production
immunity,
where
we
think
that
the
argument
about
the
incriminating
nature
of
the
act
of
production
is
essentially
academic,
and
where
there
are
no
serious
taint
problems.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
the
order
below...
the
district
court
quashed
the
subpoenas.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
case
is
not
moot
because
what
we
are...
we
are
not
asking
for
anyone
to
be
held
in
contempt.
i
suppose
that
is
what
i
am
attempting
to
say.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
are
asking
for
the
judgment
to
be
vacated
below,
and
the
judgment
below
merely
quashed
the
subpoenas.
it
didn't
enforce
them.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
it
is
made
clear
that
on
remand
a
grant
of
statutory
immunity
would
obviate
fifth
amendment
objections,
that
would
satisfy
our
position,
although
we
continue
to
maintain
that
in
the
limited
area
of
act
of
production
immunity,
this
non-statutory
functional
immunity
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
enter
an
order
vacating
the
quashing
of
the
subpoenas.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
those
would
not
be
equivalent.
there
would
still
be
other
procedures
that
would
have
to
be
followed
before
the
subpoenas
were
enforced.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
are
making
alternative
arguments,
justice
marshall.
we
believe--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
believe
that
our
offer
of
non-statutory
immunity
was
satisfactory,
but
if
that...
if
the
court
disagrees
and
makes
clear
that
an
offer
of
statutory
immunity
would
have
sufficed,
that
would
be...
that
would
serve
our
interests.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
witness
would
have
been
ordered
to
comply,
i
presume,
and
if
he
had
refused
to
comply,
he
might
have
been
held
in
contempt,
but
that
never
occurred.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we
would
have
gone
to
the
district
court
and
asked
for
an
order
of
enforcement.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
correct.
absolutely
not.
we
don't...
we
do
not
intend
to
grant
immunity
as
to--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
is
one
of
the
principal
issues,
yes.
thank
you.
