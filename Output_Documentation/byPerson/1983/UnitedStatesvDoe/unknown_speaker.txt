unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
did
the
government
ever
explain
to
the
court
that
it
would
give
the
statutory
kind
of
use
immunity?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
read
the
record,
the
government
was
just
never
clear
at
all
that
it
would
give
statutory
use
immunity,
and
i
wondered
whether
your
position
is
that
that's
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed,
if
it
is
covered,
if
the
act
of
production
is
covered
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
is
one
of
your
submissions
that
production
wouldn't
incriminate
at
all
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
that
one
of
your
submissions
here?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
you
weren't
interested
in
the
act
of
production?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
interested
in
the
materials.
unknown
speaker
well,
both
courts
below
thought
the
act
of
production
would
incriminate
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
have
to
decide
that
issue
here,
don't
we,
whether
it
would
incriminate
or
not?
we
can't
decide
that
you
must
offer
statutory
immunity
unless
it
is
incriminating.
unknown
speaker
why?
doesn't
the
statute
require
that
there
be
some
threat
of
self-incrimination
before
the
government
can
grant
immunity
or
some
claim
made?
unknown
speaker
here
is
the
united
states
saying
that
the
predicate
for
immunity
is
not
present
in
this
case,
namely,
incrimination,
unless
you
are
going
to
withdraw
that.
unknown
speaker
wishes.
i
would
suppose
we
would
have
to.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
united
states
is
free
in
the
district
court
to
say,
well,
we
are
quite
sure
that
there
is
no
incrimination
in
this
case,
but
even
if
there
isn't,
we
will
offer
statutory
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
government
could
say,
we
are
not
sure
whether
there
is
a
fifth
amendment
protection
here,
but
if
there
is,
we
offer
the
immunity
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
that
is
fine,
but
that
isn't
your
submission
here.
you
are
sure
there
is
no
incrimination.
that
is
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
you
would
concede
that
it
could
be
in
some
cases,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
did.
he
did.
both
courts
agreed
with
him.
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
one
thing.
three
times
now
you
have,
perhaps
without
emphasis,
but
at
least
i
detected
an
emphasis,
you
have
referred
to
the
act
of
production.
now,
are
you
distinguishing
between
the
act
of
producing
and
then
the
content
of
what
is
produced?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
only
thing
he
is
interested
in
protecting
is
the
content
of
what
is
produced.
the
act
of
producing
doesn't...
couldn't
possibly
incriminate
him.
unknown
speaker
but
you
concede
that
in
some
cases
where,
for
instance,
merely
identifying
the
person
who
had
the
records
and
was
able
to
produce
them
might
cast
suspicion
on
that
person
which
hadn't
existed
before,
that
it
is
at
least
abstractly
possible
that
the
act
of
production
might
incriminate.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
of
his
uncertainty
about
who
owns
the
company?
yes.
maybe
you
don't...
the
subpoenas
themselves
are
not
in
the
record.
at
least
i
haven't
seen
them,
i
don't
think.
are
they?
unknown
speaker
and
do
they
identify
the
name
of
the
person
and
the
names
of
the
companies?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
government
knows
there
is
a
silent
partner
involved
in
some
shady
enterprise
but
doesn't
know
who
it
is.
they
know
it
may
be
one
of
ten
people,
and
they
know
that
the
silent
partner
is
reputed
to
have
the
records,
so
they
simply
issue
subpoenas
for
the
records
to
each
of
the
ten
suspects.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
produces
them,
if
he
produces
them
and
you
want
to
use
them
at
trial,
would
you
have
to
further
authenticate
them?
unknown
speaker
why
would
you?
he
produced
them.
and
isn't
the
inference
that
they
are
his
records,
and
were
prepared
under
his
authority?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
my
question.
would
you
have
to
offer
further
authentication?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
it
be
enough
to
say
he
produced
them
in
response
to
our
subpoena?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
it
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
another
question.
typically,
that
would
be
stipulated
to,
if
it
has
been
produced
under
a
subpoena.
you
don't
go
through
a
long
formality
about
authentication,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
largely
academic,
why
don't
you
just
tender
him
immunity
for
any
use
of
the
act
of
production?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
attempt
to
do
it.
you
made
no
tender
in
a
formal
way.
you
didn't
ask
for
statutory--
unknown
speaker
--what
in
the
record
supports
what
you
are
telling
me,
that
you
actually
made
a
clear...
the
district
judge,
as
i
read
it,
was
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
government
was
willing
to
do
and
never
got
a
clear,
unambiguous
statement.
unknown
speaker
but
you
never
offered
immunity
from
that
particular
exposure.
you
thought
it
was
unnecessary.
you
may
be
right,
but...
if
your
position
is
that
this
is
all
academic,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
solve
the
problem
by
giving
him
statutory
immunity.
unknown
speaker
but
why
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
in
a
direct
fifth
amendment
case,
doesn't
that
solve
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand
the
position
at
all,
i
confess.
do
you
think
the
district
court...
as
i
understand
your
submission,
even
if
you
had
formally
offered
statutory
immunity,
the
district
court
would
not
have
required
the
records
to
be
produced
because
the
immunity
wouldn't
effectively
replace
the
privilege.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it
was
the
logic,
except
that
he
didn't
have
to
rule
on
that
against
the...
in
the
face
of
an
offer
of
statutory
immunity.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
have
been
easier
to
have
offered
it
and
had
it
refused?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
us
to
retrospect
you
back
and
give
you
another
bite.
on
this
question
of
the
act,
you
say
that
simply
because
these
are
ordinary
business
records,
the
act
of
production
doesn't
involve
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
of
any
irs
cases
that
were
decided
solely
on
regular
business
records?
i
mean,
how
many
millions,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
many
irs
cases
are
decided
solely
on
payrolls,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
so
the
act
of
production
does
incriminate
you,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
of
producing
ordinary
records.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
prove
that
it
had
some
general
ledgers,
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
these
were
the
particular
general
ledgers
that
this
company
had.
quite
a
difference,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
is
saying,
these
are
the
documents
described
in
the
subpoena,
and
then
up
until
now
they
have
been
in
my
custody.
that
is
what
he
is
saying.
so
you
are
not
going
to
argue
about
that
after
the
documents
are
produced.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
hope
that
this
is
the
only
trouble
we
are
going
to
have
with
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
need
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
tell
you
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
major
issue
here,
i
take
it.
and
that
is
really
what
you
want
reversed,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
we
should
let
you
argue
that.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
anything
left
of
boyd
for
a
diary
or
private
letter?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about...
i
must
confess,
i
had
some
difficulty
following
part
of
the
government's
brief.
i
just
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals
as
having
held,
as
i
think
you
seem
to
assume,
that
these
business
records
are
protected
themselves.
there
were
no
testimonial
act
in
the
producing
of
them.
do
you
think
that
they
held
that
all
of
these
documents
are
protected
by
the
privilege?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
opinion
do
you
find
that?
as
i
understood
them,
they
were
rejecting
the
argument
that
a
private
sole
proprietor
is
totally
outside
the
fifth
amendment
just
as
a
representative
of
a
corporation
or
partnership
is,
and
that's
all
they
held.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
14a?
unknown
speaker
they
are
describing
what
they
think
gould--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
is
in
the
section
of
the
opinion
in
which
they
are
addressing
the
question
whether
the
act
of
production
is
a
testimonial
act.
that
is
in
part
b
of
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it's
in
part
b
of
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
they
are
talking
about
whether
the
act
of
producing
those
papers
is
protected,
i
respectfully
submit.
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
they
held
that,
they
would
obviously
be
wrong.
unknown
speaker
if
they
didn't
hold
it,
there
isn't
anything
we
need
to
decide.
that
is
all
i
am
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
respondent,
i
would
be
so
arguing,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
the
government
feel
it
had
to
follow
the
statutory
procedure?
i
guess
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
will
you
refresh
my
recollection,
mr.
alito,
on
the
source
and
nature
of
non-statutory
immunity?
is
it
just
the
right
of
every
assistant
u.s.
attorney
to
tell
the
judge
that
is
trying
the
case
that
the
government
won't
use
this
person's
testimony
if
he
is
ordered
to
testify
over
the
claim
of
privilege?
unknown
speaker
why
did
you
ever
need
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
was,
i
suppose,
that
the
courts
kept
excluding
the
evidence,
absent
a
grant
of
immunity.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
leaves
the
witness
in
some
quandary,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
he
doesn't
have
to
be
offered
immunity,
and
he
just
has
to
guess
whether
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
case?
unknown
speaker
so
the
government
really
wouldn't
object
if
a
judge
just
said,
don't
worry,
mr.
witness,
i
guarantee
you
that
any
of
these...
any
of
your
testimony
or
none
of
these
papers
can
be
used
against
you
in
a
criminal--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
you
would.
i
would
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would
want
to
be
in
control
on
immunity
issues.
unknown
speaker
you
say
a
judge
can't
do
it
on
his
own
without
the
government
requesting
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
that
estop
him
from
changing--
--so
if
a
judge
says,
i
am
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
you,
mr.
attorney
general,
until
you...
if
you
come
up
here
and
offer
statutory
immunity,
that
is
another
question.
that
may
be
all
right.
but--
unknown
speaker
--no,
i
know
that,
but
i
can
call
the
u.s.
attorney
the
attorney
general
if
i
want
to.
unknown
speaker
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
granting
the
immunity
and
accepting
a
u.s.
attorney's
prediction
that
this
testimony
would
not
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
philips,
do
you
have
at
your
fingertips
the
citation
in
the
record
before
us
to
the
stipulation
of
the
government
as
to
the
incriminating
nature?
0....
if
you
don't
have
it,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
argument
to
that
extent.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
was
the
ruling
of
the
district
court,
mr.
philips,
based
on
the
notion
that
the
act
of
production
would
incriminate
as
opposed
to
the
contents
of
the
documents?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
take
it
the
government
denies
that
the
contents
of
the
documents
would
incriminate.
it
is
just
not
compulsory.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
so
the
stipulation,
i
would...
if
you
just
ask,
will
these
papers
incriminate,
i
would
think
you
would
say
yes,
which
is
exactly
what
the
government
says.
unknown
speaker
so
you
still
have
the
question,
though,
would
it
be
compulsory
self-incrimination,
and
the
government's
argument
is
that
when
you
produce
papers
pursuant
to
subpoena
that
have
already
long
before
the
subpoena
issued
been
compiled,
the
subpoena
doesn't
compel
you
to
record
what
you
record
in
those
papers
because
you
recorded
it
beforehand.
unknown
speaker
let's
go
back
just
a
minute
to
the
act
of
production,
because
i
understood
the
earlier
discussion
between
mr.
alito
and
members
of
the
bench
to
focus
on
the
idea
of
the
act
of
production
as
being
a
separate
incriminating
act
quite
apart
from
the
contents
of
the
papers.
the
mere
fact
that
you
had
these
records,
whatever
the
records
may
have
said,
might
tend
to
incriminate
you.
now,
i
gather
from
what
you
just
said
that
you
look
upon
the
act
of
production
as
being
able
to
relate
back
to
the
contents
of
the
papers
in
some
way.
do
you?
unknown
speaker
under
fisher,
that
is
just
not
compulsory
self-incrimination.
maybe
it
is
self-incrimination,
but
it
is
not
compulsory,
because
the
papers
were
compiled
long
ago.
unknown
speaker
mr.
philips,
what
if
you
were
given
statutory
immunity,
your
client
was,
that
nothing
could
be...
no
adverse
inference
of
criminal
conduct
could
be
drawn
from
the
act
of
producing
these
documents?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
it
clearly
covered
everything
relating
to
the
production,
but
did
not
cover
the
government's
ability
to
use
what
was
found
within
the
documents.
in
other
words,
it
would
allow
them
to
treat
them
as
though
they
found
them
out
in
the
park
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
and
my
question
is,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
the
fifth
amendment
only
protects
compelled
testimony
concerning
the
existence
of
the
documents?
there
is
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment
about
existence
of
evidence
that
is
protected.
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
isn't
what
fisher
was
based
on.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
make
that
argument.
i
don't
either.
unknown
speaker
but
that
shifts
over
again
to
the
act
of
production
type
of
self-incrimination
compelled
that
we
were
talking
about
during
the
government's
case.
why
don't
you
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
example
of
what
if
the
government
agreed
in
this
case
that
all
connection
between
the
production
and
location
of
these
documents
and
your
client
would
be
immunized,
but
nonetheless
the
government
would
be
free
to
use
the
contents
of
the
documents
against
your
client.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
your
client
say
that
the
very
existence
of
the
documents
would
tend
to
incriminate
him?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
contrary
to
fisher,
in
my
view,
your
position.
unknown
speaker
may
i...
i
am
puzzled.
you
are
not
asking
for
enforcement
of
the
subpoenas?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say...
well,
then
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
are
you
asking
for
enforcement
of
the
subpoenas?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
vacate
a
judgment
but
refuse
to
enforce
the
subpoena,
presumably
you
have
to
write
something
about
why
you
are
vacating
the
judgment,
and
when
you
write
that,
ought
the
court
to
discuss
whether
the
subpoena
should
have
been
enforced
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion.
what
order
do
you
ask
us
to
direct
the
district
court
to
enter?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
enforcing
the
subpoenas?
unknown
speaker
what
you
really
want
is
for
us
to
say,
you
made
a
mistake,
you
are
not
asking
for
immunity,
and
we
will
vacate
and
send
it
back
so
you
can
do
what
you
should
have
done
before.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
that
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
this
case
get
into
the
district
court?
you
issued
some
subpoenas,
and
there
was
a
motion
to
