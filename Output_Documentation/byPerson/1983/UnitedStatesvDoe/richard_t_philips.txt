mr.
richard
t.
philips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
submit
that
this
case
boils
down
to
an
impermissible
attempt
by
the
government
to
use
investigative
techniques
that
are
not
constitutionally
sanctioned.
what
the
government
has
done
in
this
case
is
rather
than
go
out
and
do
the
footwork
necessary
to
conduct
an
investigation,
to
secure
the
documents
necessary
in
the
course
of
that
investigation,
they
have
served
on
the
target
of
the
investigation
a
grand
jury
subpoena
requiring
him
to
produce
his
personal
financial
records
as
well
as
the
financial
records
of
several
sole
proprietorships
which
the
government
intends
to
use
against
him
at
a
later
date
in
a
criminal
trial.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
impermissible,
and
the
court
should
not
sanction
this
type
of
investigative
technique.
these
five
subpoenas
served
upon
my
client
were
immediately
objected
to
in
the
district
court
by
a
motion
to
quash.
in
the
district
court,
the
government
made
several
major
concessions.
first,
they
stipulated
that
my
client
was
a
target
of
the
grand
jury
investigation,
and
second,
they
stipulated
that
the
documents
that
they
sought
would
or
may
incriminate
my
client.
the
district
court
quashed
the
subpoenas,
using
the
rationale
of
this
court's
decision
in
fisher,
finding
that
the
subpoenas
compelled
a
testimonial
communication--
mr.
richard
t.
philips
--it
is
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
the
court
asked
the
government,
"do
you
also
concede
that
the
documents
which
you
seek
will
or
may
incriminate
my
client?
"
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
answered,
"yes,
your
honor".
so
the
stipulations
that
the
government
made
in
the
district
court,
number
one,
that
my
client
was
a
target
of
the
investigation,
and
number
two,
that
the
documents
sought
would
or
may
incriminate
him,
i
suggest
to
the
court
are
extremely
important.
the
district
court
quashed
the
grand
jury
subpoenas
using
this
court's
rationale
in
the
united
states
versus
fisher,
finding
that
the
subpoenas
compelled
a
testimonial
communication
that
was
in
fact
incriminating.
there
was
little
discussion
about
compulsion,
and
little
discussion
about
the
incriminating
nature
of
the
testimonial
communications,
since
the--
mr.
richard
t.
philips
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
when
the
case
got
to
the
third
circuit,
i
believe
the
third
circuit
expanded
and
discussed
the
protection
of
papers
rationale
as
set
forth
in
this
court's
opinions
from
boyd
to
the
present.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
no,
i
don't
believe
the
government
denies
that
the
contents
would
incriminate.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
i
understand
that,
but
the
subpoena
does
compel
you
to
produce
those
records,
and
i
don't
understand
how
the
government
can
separate
the
contents
of
the
records
from
the
act
of
production.
if
we
discuss
the
immunity
that
the
government
offers
as
to
the
act
of
production--
mr.
richard
t.
philips
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
you
could
separate
the
contents
of
the
papers
where
the
government
says
the
contents
are
incriminatory.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
but
it
is
not
the
compulsory
self-incrimination.
it
is
the
compulsion
to
produce
those
records
which
we
object
to.
it
is
the
self-incrimination
that
the
government
stipulates
is
contained
within
the
contents
of
the
documents.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
if
statutory
immunity
were
offered
in
this
case,
if
it
were
conferred,
i
believe
we
would
be
at
a
different
stage.
first,
i
would
argue...
first,
i
would
have
no
legal
objection
to
the
conference
of
immunity.
the
district
court
would
grant
the
immunity
as
requested
by
the
government.
the
only
objection
that
possibly
could
be
made
is,
is
the
immunity
that
is
being
offered
under
the
statute
coextensive
with
my
client's
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
then
i
would
argue
that
that
is
not
coextensive
with
my
client's
privilege.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
it
is
not
coextensive
with
the
privilege
because
i
cannot
separate
the
contents
of
the
documents
from
the
act
of
production.
if
the
government
is
seeking
to
immunize
the
act
of
production
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
existence
of
the
documents
has
not
in
any
way
been
demonstrated
by
the
government,
the
immunity
must
also
extend
to
the
fact
that
those
documents
are
in
existence,
and
if
it
extends
to
the
fact
that
those
documents
are
in
existence,
it
must
necessarily
extend
to
the
contents
of
the
documents.
i
don't
understand
how
the
government
can
separate
them.
if
the
documents
are
in
existence,
and
if
the
government
has
no...
if
the
documents
are
in
existence,
the
government
has
no
indication
that
they
are
in
existence,
then
the
immunity
must
extend
to
the
existence
of
the
documents,
which
necessarily
has
to
cover
the
contents.
so
therefore--
mr.
richard
t.
philips
--i
believe
the
fifth
amendment
protects
compelled
production
of
incriminatory
documents,
and
where
the
existence
of
the
document
is
unknown
to
the
government,
to
immunize
only
the
act
of
production
without
immunizing
the
fact
that
the
documents
are
in
existence
is
not
coextensive
with
my
client's
fifth
amendment
privilege.
you
must
immunize
also
the
contents.
the
use
and
derivative
use
of
the
act
of
production
must
cover
the
contents
of
the
documents
in
order
for
the
immunity
to
be
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
that
is
my
understanding
as
to
the
testimonial
nature
of
the
act
of
production
as
discussed
in
fisher.
in
fisher,
the
court
found
that
the
act
of
production
was
non-testimonial,
because
there
the
documents
were...
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
documents
were
in
existence.
here
there
has
never
been
any
conclusion
or
indication
that
these
documents
are
in
existence.
in
fact,
the
third
circuit
found
that
this
is
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
link
up
my
client
with
these
proprietorships,
and
that
the
government
has
no
indication
and
has
come
forward
with
no
evidence
that
these
documents
are
in
existence.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
only
if
they
agreed
that
the
existence
of
the
documents,
the
very
existence
of
the
documents
would
be
immunized
would
i
then
say
that
the
immunity
that
they
are
offering
is
coextensive
with--
mr.
richard
t.
philips
--because
of
the
government's
own
stipulation
that
the
contents
tend
to
incriminate
him.
i
cannot
separate
the
contents
from
existence.
mr.
richard
t.
philips
in
any
event,
the
point
is
that
the
government
never
did
use
the
statutory
immunity
which
they
had
the
right
to
in
the
district
court,
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
reason
they
did
not
use
that
statute
was
because
they
themselves
were
unsure
of
what
was
to
be
immunized.
my
argument
today,
briefly
outlined,
is
that
first
of
all,
my
client
is
entitled
to
the
privilege
on
the
protection
of
papers
rationale
based
on
this
court's
cases
from
boyd
through
fisher
and
including
andresen.
if
not
under
the
privacy
rationale
and
the
protection
of
papers
rationale
of
those
cases,
then
the
compelled
production
of
these
documents
in
this
case
would
amount
to
a
compelled
testimonial
communication
which
is
incriminatory
as
the
third
circuit
and
district
court
found,
and
that
based
on
that,
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
would
be
valid.
the
government
rests
their
argument
completely
on
fisher.
they
pick
and
choose
language
from
fisher
and
disregard
the
context
that
that
language
is
used.
the
government
ignores
the
factual
background
of
fisher
that
there,
the
documents
that
were
being
sought
were
being
sought
from
attorneys,
they
were
not
the
taxpayers'
records.
there
was
no
compulsion
upon
the
taxpayer
in
that
case,
and
in
fact
the
records
were
not
his,
but
they
were
the
work
papers
of
the
accountant.
in
numerous
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
privilege
belongs
to
the
individual.
in
wilson,
the
court
held
that
a
corporation
had
no
privilege,
but
the
court
carefully
distinguished
the
situation
where
an
individual
was
involved.
in
white
and
bellis,
i
suggest
the
same
distinction
between
a
separate
entity
and
an
individual
was
made.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
court
was
very
careful
to
distinguish
that
the
rights
of
an
individual
not
to
be
compelled
to
produce
incriminating
private
papers.
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
those
cases
the
court
was
faced
with
a
policy
decision
of
whether
there
was
an
overriding
governmental
interest
that
the
government
had
to
seek
access
during
the
course
of
its
investigations
to
the
records
of
a
collective
entity.
the
court
found
that
there
was
because
of
the
scope
of
the
economic
activity
of
a
corporation
or
a
labor
union
or
a
partnership.
here,
the
court
is
faced
with
a
somewhat
similar
policy
question,
but
here,
there
is
no
overriding
concern
or
governmental
interest
to
seek
the
records
of
a
sole
proprietor.
there
is
no
mass
abandonment
of
a...
or
there
would
be
no
mass
abandonment
of
the
corporate
form
of
doing
business
or
the
partnership
form
of
doing
business
to
become
a
sole
proprietor.
there
is
no
large
scope
of
activity
of
sole
proprietors
that...
the
government
makes
a
distinction
between
business
and
personal
records.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
distinction
is
invalid,
that
the
only
distinction
that
this
court
has
that
finds
support
in
the
cases
of
this
court
is
the
distinction
between
an
individual
and
a
representative
of
a
collective
entity.
there
can
foresee
endless
litigation
over
particular
documents
whether
they
are
business
or
whether
they
are
personal.
in
summary,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit.
thank
you.
