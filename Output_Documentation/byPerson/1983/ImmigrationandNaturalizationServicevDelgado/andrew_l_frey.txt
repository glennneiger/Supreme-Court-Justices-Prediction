mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
suit
by
four
individuals...
two
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
two
aliens
lawfully
present
in
the
united
states...
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
challenging
the
lawfulness
of
the
manner
in
which
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
conducted
factory
surveys
at
two
garment
factories
in
southern
california
in
which
the
respondents
were
employed.
the
importance
of
these
factory
surveys
to
the
ins'
responsibility
to
attempt
to
apprehend
and
deport
aliens
illegally
present
in
the
united
states
is
difficult
to
overstate.
the
record
shows
that
in
los
angeles
in
1977
20,000
illegal
aliens
were
apprehended
in
the
course
of
such
surveys,
and
the
immigration
service
has
told
us
that
away
from
the
border
at
the
time
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case
approximately
60
percent
of
all
apprehensions
of
illegal
aliens
occurred
in
the
course
of
factory
surveys.
now
some
years
ago
the
factory
surveys
became
during
the
1970s
a
more
important
tool
to
the
ins
for
several
reasons.
one
was
a
matter
of
values.
previously
a
lot
of
the
enforcement
efforts
had
been
concentrated
in
residential
investigations
of
areas
where
there
were
believed
to
be
high
concentrations
of
illegal
aliens
living,
and
it
was
thought
that
it
would
be
far
less
intrusive,
it
would
raise
fewer
fourth
amendment
problems,
it
would
be
less
intrusive
in
privacy
values
for
the
agency
to
concentrate
on
the
workplace
rather
than
in
residential
areas.
secondly,
it
was
believed...
and
i
think
quite
plainly
accurately...
that
this
was
a
more
effective
utilization
of
the
resources
of
the
service,
because
a
relatively
small
number
of
agents
were
able
to
make
relatively
substantial
numbers
of
apprehensions.
and,
thirdly,
it
was
deemed
appropriate
because
the
prospect
of
employment
is
the
principal
magnet
that
draws
people
to
attempt
to
enter
the
country
illegally
and
work
force
surveys
and
enforcement
efforts
concentrated
on
the
work
force
seem
correlative
to
the
factors
that
have
drawn
the
people
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
believe
that
they
do.
we
don't
challenge
their
standing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
reason
i
think
they
do
is
that
these
work
place
surveys
are
recurrent
and
at
garment
factories
where
these
individuals
were
employed
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be,
and
in
fact
at
davis
pleating
company
there
were
two
surveys
during
the
year
in
question.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
likely
to
be
repeated
if
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
reversed.
the
consequences
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
while
factory
surveys
are
still
being
done,
they
are
very
difficult
to
do
at
large
facilities
like
davis
pleating
because
the
restrictions
would
make
it
too
chaotic,
and
i'll
get
to
that
shortly.
now
i'd
like
to
briefly
describe
these
surveys.
first,
the
first
point
that
i
think
is
significant
is
that
they
are
not
done
randomly
but
they
are
based
on
investigations
which
lead
to
the
acquisition
of
information
that
a
substantial
number
of
illegal
aliens
are
employed
at
the
particular
target
factory.
and
indeed
the
results
of
the
surveys
that
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
indicate
this.
the
first
davis
survey--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
there
is,
yes.
i
think
there
is
an
affidavit
from
one
of
the
ins
directors,
i
believe,
that
suggest
that.
logic
would
dictate
that
it
would
make
no
sense
for
them
to
go
about
randomly.
they
have
very
limited
resources
in
terms
of
personnel
to
do
these
things,
and
they
obviously
want
to
utilize
them
in
the
most
effective
way
where
they
can
arrest
the
largest
number
of
people
with
the
smallest
number
of
agents.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
were
warrants
in
two
of
the
three
searches
in
this
case.
they
proceed
either
by
warrant
or
by
consent.
i'm
told
that
in
about
90
percent
of
the
cases
the
factory
owner
or
management
gives
consent
to
the
survey,
and
where
consent
is
not
given
a
warrant
is
used.
in
these
cases,
78
illegal
aliens
were
arrested
in
the
first
davis
survey;
39
in
the
second;
and
in
the
mr.
pleat
survey
45,
which
was
50
percent
of
the
work
force.
there
were
90
workers;
45
were
found
to
be
illegal
aliens
and
apprehended.
there
may,
of
course,
have
been
some
more.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
relied
for
its
holding,
in
part,
on
the
fact
that
the
factories
are
enclosed
and
that
the
exits...
that
agents
were
stationed
at
the
exits.
if
you
had
an
outdoor
job
site
you
would
have
a
different
factual
situation.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
reach
the
same
conclusions.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
any
issue
of
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
no.
the
warrant
is
obtained
to
deal
with
the
interests
of
the
owner
of
the
factory
and
not
having
his
premises
searched.
this
case
involves
no
search
issue;
it
involves
only
issues
of
seizures...
whether
there
were
seizures
and,
if
so,
whether
they
were
lawful.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
would
pose
some
interesting
and
difficult
questions
whether...
if
you
had
this
abstract
20
or
25
percent
probability
that
the
individual
you
stopped
had
committed
a
crime
but
no
specific
information.
martinez-fuerte
was
a
case
somewhat
like
that,
and
i
think
that
that
is
not
at
all
involved
in
this
case
because
there
are
no
individual
seizures
of
particular
workers
based
on...
not
based
on
information
specifically
relating
to
those
workers.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
as
i...
the
interrogations
are
not
random
but
the
interrogations--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
they
are
not.
they
don't
involve
seizures
of
the
individuals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
on
interrogations.
it
applies
to
seizures.
if
you
must
seize
and
forceably
detain
a
person
in
order
to
question
them,
then
the
fourth
amendment
is
brought
into
play
because
you
have
seized
them
and
they
have
a
protection
against
being
unreasonably
seized.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear.
it
think
it
is
absolutely
clear
after
florida
against
royer
that
what...
if
you
look
at
the
record
of
this
case,
what
happens
is
a
person
is
approached,
asked
if
he's
a
citizen.
there
is
no
physical
contact
except
that
miramontes,
i
think,
or
lebonte
was
tapped
on
the
shoulder.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't.
we
don't
do
anything
unless
in
the
course
of
saying
it
or
something
else
that
he
or
she
has
done
we
acquire
a
particularized
suspicion
of
illegal
alienage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
move
on
to
another
person.
that
in
fact
doesn't
happen
in
these
situations
very
frequently,
but
that
is
what
the
agents
are
instructed
to
do
unless
they
have
a
particularized
suspicion
of
illegal
alienage.
they
are
not
to
engage
in
detentive
questioning.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
and
read
the
joint
appendix,
which
i
urge
you
to
do,
and
read
the
testimony
of
the
respondents
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
you
would
only...
i
mean,
i
come
away
with
the
conclusion
that
they
were
trying
to
give
the
agents
an
award
for
their
scrupulous
sensitivity
to
fourth
amendment
rights
and
not
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that
would
be
the--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
is
nothing...
that
is
the
problem
that's
inherent
in
any
terry
stop
situation,
if
the
individual
refuses--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--if
probable
cause
does
not
develop
during
the
course
of
the
detention,
then
the
detention
must
be
terminated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that's
what
the
court
said
in
florida
against
royer...
even
questions
of
people
who
they
suspect,
as
long
as
it
is
not
accompanied
by
conduct
that
would
lead
the
person
reasonably
to
believe
that
they
were
not
free
to
leave.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
you
may
detain
them
and
you
may
ask
a
question
and
if
in
the
course
of
that
brief
detention
probable
cause
develops,
you
may
then
arrest
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
are
out
of
luck
except
in
circumstances
where
there
may
be
some
other
brief
investigative
measure
that
you
can
take
while
you're
holding
him
that
might
clarify
the
situation
and
develop
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
define
somewhat
the
issues
in
this
case
because
i
think
it's
very
important
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
and
the
respondents'
brief
is
quite
confusing
on
this.
but
there
are
two
separate
issues.
one
is
the
question
of
whether
the
entire
work
force
is
seized
by
the
techniques
that
are
employed
in
the
factory
survey
and,
if
so,
whether
that
seizure
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
then
there
would
be...
the
next
question
would
be
whether
in
the
course
of
conducting
the
survey
and
having
contact
with
individual
workers
at
the
work
place
what
transpires
is
a
seizure
and,
if
so,
is
that
seizure
lawful
on
an
individual
basis
rather
than
a
group
basis.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no,
no,
no.
if
i
said
that,
i
did
not
intend
that.
i
understood
him
to
be
postulating
if
there
were
such
a
detention
what
consequences
would
flow
if
there
were
no
questions
asked,
or
no
answers
given.
let
me
back
up
for
a
minute.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
there
is
an
illegal
seizure
of
the
entire
work
force,
then
this
case
presents
no
issue
of
whether
people
can
be
questioned
on
the
basis
of
a
suspicion
of
alienage
alone,
because
there
already
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
they
have
all
been
unlawfully
seized.
the
relief
that's
been
entered
would
be
entered.
if
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
submit,
is
wrong
in
that,
the
record
in
this
case
presents
not
a
single
instance
in
which
any
person
was
detained
for
questioning
on
the
basis
solely
of
a
suspicion
of
alienage
alone,
and
not
of
illegal
alienage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
as
i
said
earlier,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
regulate
questioning;
it
regulates
seizures.
respondent--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--hum?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
were
no...
i
maintain
as
stoutly
as
i
am
able
to
that
there
were
no
individual
seizures
in
this
case,
and
if
you
look
at
the
interchanges
correa
was
not
asked
any
questions
during
the
first
survey
and
during
the
second
survey;
she
was
asked
if
she
was
a
citizen,
said
she
was,
and
the
agent
moved
on.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
they
do
not
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
person
is
an
alien
unlawfully
present
in
the
country
or
has
committed
some
violation
of
the
immigration
laws,
they
let
him
leave.
there's
no
indication
that
anybody
was
detained
in
this
case,
prevented
from
leaving
or
going
about
their
business
on
the
basis
of
a
mere
suspicion
of
alienage
or
anything
else.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
testimony.
everybody
suggests
that
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts.
i
would
say
there
is
no--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
would
say
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
material
facts.
that
is,
i
would
say
if
you
look
at
the
testimony
you
will
see
nothing
that
raises
any
factual
issues.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
can
get
a
different
impression
from
the
adjectives.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
respondents
did.
two
of
them
in
this
case
walked
right
out.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
well,
i
don't
really--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
it's
a
case
in
which
it
would
have
been
perhaps
helpful
to
have
some
findings
of
fact,
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
in
its
legal
conclusions
it
makes
no
difference
whether
anybody
was
stopped
or
would
have
been
stopped,
because
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
the
fact
that
agents
were
visible
in
the
doorways
was
itself
enough
to
constitute
a
seizure
and
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
and
on
that
basis
an
injunction
has
been
issued
against--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
our
position,
i
think,
but
we
are
into
some
areas
of
civil
procedure
that
i
don't
feel
terribly
comfortable
with.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
number
of
points,
but
if
the
court
were
to
conclude,
as
we
think
it
must
if
it
applies
its
prior
fourth
amendment
principles,
that
there
was
no
seizure
of
the
entire
work
force--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
entire
court
of
appeals
decision,
i
think,
falls
because
there
is
no
suggestion--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
would
do
that
if
i
were
in
your
shoes,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
in
my
opinion
the
linchpin
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
its
holding
of
the
entire
work
force
was
seized
by
the
procedures
used
in
the
survey.
if
you
disagree...
if
you
agree
with
that
holding,
you
would
then
have
to
move
on
to
our
contention
that
if
they
were
seized
it
was
a
reasonable
seizure
under
the
principles
of
martinez-fuerte.
that
would
have
to
be
decided.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
suggestion
in
this
case
of
any
individual
contact
between
agent
and
respondent
that
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
so
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
need
to
reach
those
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
wanted
to
talk
a
bit
about
what
evidence
there
is
in
this
case,
what
allegations
there
are
in
the
complaint,
and
what
evidence
there
is
in
the
deposition
testimony
of
anything
that
might
be
argued,
and
my
opponents
do
argue,
are
in
some
instances
fourth
amendment
violations.
first
of
all,
in
the
first
amended
complaint
there
was
an
allegation
that
an
individual
who
was
then
a
plaintiff
in
the
case
was
asked
whether
he
was
a
citizen
and
said
he
was
a
citizen
and
was
nevertheless
taken
away
and
deported,
although
he
was
a
citizen.
i
would
agree
that
this
allegation
would
state
a
very
likely
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
turned
out,
however,
that
he
had
to
be
withdrawn
as
a
plaintiff
from
the
case
because
he
was
an
illegal
alien.
now
there
is
also
the
instance
that
respondent
delgado
complains
about.
in
the
conversation
with
delgado
the
agent
approached
him
and
said
are
you
a
citizen.
he
said
yes.
he
said
where
were
you
born.
mayaguez,
puerto
rico.
he
moved
on.
then,
according
to
delgado,
he
heard
the
agent,
one
agent
say
to
another
agent...
this
is
at
joint
appendix
94...
"i
heard
him
say,
he
said,
'when
we
come
back
we're
going
to
have
to
check
them
closer.
"
"they
speak
too
well
of
an
english'.
"
this
was
one
of
the
things
that
is
complained
of
by
our
opponents
in
this
case.
how
this
amounts
to
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
i
don't
understand.
respondent
miramontes
complains
that
she
was
frightened
by
the
survey
because
when
she
was
approached
she
was
asked
if
she
was
an
alien
and
she
said
she
was...
she's
a
lawful
resident
alien.
she
was
asked
for
her
papers
and
she
momentarily
thought
that
she
did
not
have
her
papers
on
her
person,
as
she
is
required
by
law
to
do,
and
she
was
afraid
that
she
might
be
arrested
for
not
having
her
papers,
although
in
fact
she
did
have
her
papers.
she
produced
them
and
they
moved
on
to
somebody
else.
now
this
amounts
to
a
mere
fear
that
the
agents
would
act
in
conformity
with
the
fourth
amendment
if
she
gave
them
cause
to
do
so
by
giving
them
probable
cause
to
arrest
her.
then
there
is
an
incident
described
in
the
testimony
of
an
ins
agent
at
page
158
of
the
joint
appendix
and
relied
on
by
our
opponents
in
which
he
describes
a
case
in
which
someone
went
running
out
of
the
factory
to
the
parking
lot
to
a
car
and
he
watched
this
person
because
he
did
not
want
him
to
get
in
the
car
and
drive
off,
but
the
person
then
returned
to
the
factory
and
he
didn't
do
anything.
there
was
no
seizure
of
any
individual.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
individual
was
allowed
to
go
out
of
the
factory
unimpeded.
finally...
and
this
is
repeated
many
times
in
respondents'
brief...
there
is
one
incident
which
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix
which
is
at
page
27
of
respondent
miramontes'
testimony.
she
was
asked:
"did
you
hear
anyone
answering
that
they
were
american
citizens?
"
answer:
"i
heard
one
in
the
shipping
department.
"
"what
happened"?
"he
said
he
was
an
american
citizen.
"
"what
did
the
immigration
officer
do?
"
"he
was
handcuffed.
"
"he
let
him
go
and
then
i
don't
know
what
happened.
"
"i
noticed
he
took
the
handcuffs
off
and
then
he
went
back
to
the
shipping
department.
"
"i
don't
know.
"
now
it
is
conceivable
that
somewhere
in
that
interaction
between
agent
and
employee
there
may
have
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
but,
of
course,
miramontes
doesn't
know
what
caused
the
agent--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
there
may
have
been
probable
cause
to
do
so.
she
has
no
idea--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i'm
not...
if
her
testimony
is
accurate,
i
would
say
that
he
was
seized,
i
would
agree.
but
what
she
does
not
know
and
what
there
is
no
allegation
of
is
that
the
seizure
wasn't
reasonable.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
also
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
on
this
question
of
whether
the
entire
work
force
was
seized
to
the
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
in
holding
that
the
entire
work
force
was
seized.
now
these
are
summarized
in
the
permanent
injunction
and
declaratory
judgment
which
i
sent
up
to
the
court
on
monday.
it's
just
a
convenient
summary
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
and
it's
at
page
2
of
the
judgment.
first,
investigators
placed
in
doorways,
and
that
is,
among
these
factors,
i
think
the
only
one
that
is
significant
and,
of
course,
our
position
with
respect
to
that
factor
is
that
any
citizen
or
lawful
alien
would
have...
it's
perfectly
obvious
what
the
investigators
are
placed
in
the
doorways
for,
and
the
evidence
suggests
they
don't
actually
block
the
doorways.
they
are
just
visible
in
the
doorways.
and
that
is
that
when
the
survey
begins
there
are
often
cries
of
"l'emigra",
people
running
and
hiding.
if
the
doorways
were
left
unguarded,
as
now
happens
under
the
injunction,
people
running
out
and
trying
to
get
away...
quite
understandably.
by
placing
agents
visibly
in
the
doorway
that
discourages
people
from
attempting
to
flee
the
factor,
illegal
aliens--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--they
are
not
in
uniform.
and
i
think
from
the
standpoint
of
a
citizen
or
a
lawfully
resident
alien
there
is
nothing
frightening.
there
is
no
reason
for
those
people
to
suppose
that
they
have
been
seized
in
any
sense
under
the
fourth
amendment.
they
are...
these
individuals,
respondents,
were
free
to
walk
about
the
factory.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
free
to
leave.
in
fact,
the
instructions
that
the
agents
have
are
when
someone
seeks
to
leave
the
factory,
if
they
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
illegal
alienage
they
are
to
detain
them
and
ask
them
questions.
they
may
otherwise
ask
them
a
question,
a
non-detentive
one.
all
right.
now,
second,
the
number
of
investigators
utilized.
well,
when
you
have
a
factory
with
two
or
three
hundred
employees,
like
davis
pleating,
to
use
35
or
20
investigators,
some
of
whom
are
stationed
outside,
seems
to
us
quite
reasonable.
third,
the
surprise
nature
of
the
operation.
well,
this
reminds
me
of
the
argument
in
dalia
against
the
united
states
that
you
had
to
give
notice
to
the
individual
when
you
were
placing
a
bug
in
his
office.
obviously
these
operations
have
to
be
by
surprise.
the
methodical
questioning
of
workers.
well,
that's
what
they're
there
for.
the
verbal
announcement
of
ins
authority
and
the
display
of
badges.
i
dare
say
that
if
they
had
come
in
without
badges
and
without
announcing
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing,
i
would
certainly
find
that
more
offensive
and
i
suspect
the
court
of
appeals
would,
too.
the
carrying
or
use
of
handcuffs,
something
that
is
obviously
reasonable
since
they
are
going
to
be
arresting
a
large
number
of
people,
not
all
of
whom
will
be
cooperative.
and,
finally,
the
apprehension
of
fleeing
co-workers
in
the
sight
of
the
work
force.
well,
if
they
can't
apprehend
co-workers
in
the
sight
of
the
work
force,
what
they
have
to
do
is
create
a
situation
in
which
they
are
induced
to
run
out
of
the
workplace
and
be
arrested
outside.
now
this
is
a
prescription
for
chaos,
not
for
conformity
with
the
fourth
amendment.
i
have
one
other
thing.
i
urge
you
particularly
to
look
at
page
130
of
the
joint
appendix
and
the
testimony
of
miramontes
because
she
was
questioned
there
about
what
was
really
bothering
her
about
the
surveys.
and
what
bothered
her
about
the
surveys
was,
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
these
illegal
alien
workers
who
were
arrested
had
not
committed
any
crime,
in
her
view,
and
it
disturbed
her
that
they
were
being
arrested
and
deported.
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
party
for
the
immigration
service.
it
is
a
sad
situation
that
these
people
have
to
be
deported.
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment;
it
is
an
enforcement
of
the
law.
it
also
disturbed
her
that
citizens
are
not
required
to
produce
identification
and
lawful
resident
aliens
are
required.
now
again
i
can
understand
why
that
might
be
annoying,
but
that
is
the
law
and
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
remember
whether
i
heard
the
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
somewhat.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
see
no
inconsistency.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
none
whatever.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
the
slightest,
not
the
slightest.
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
employer
has
no
duty.
this
case
does
not
focus
at
all
on
the
employer's
rights
or
duties.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
sure-tan
that
the
immigration
service
should
not
enforce
the
law
that
requires
the
apprehension
and
deportation
of
illegal
aliens.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
sure
i
did.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
congress
wants--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--sure-tan
turns
on
the
problem
of
the
special
policies
which...
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
may
or
may
not
control
the
result
in
that
case.
that
is
a
policy
that
is
made
by
congress
and
it
is
the
court's
duty
to
determine
how
that
policy
affects
the
decision
in
that
case.
that
policy
is
not
in
play
here
and,
therefore,
there's
no
inconsistency
in
going
straightforwardly
with
our
enforcement
efforts
in
conformity
with
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
perhaps
so.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
this
is
a
union
shop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
union
shop.
in
fact,
originally
the
ladies
garment
workers
union
was
a
plaintiff
in
this
case;
they
were
dismissed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
think
my
colleague
underestimates
the
intelligence
of
his
clients
when
he
suggests
that
they
are
so
frightened
for
their
own
welfare.
in
fact,
respondent
correa,
in
explaining
what
bothered
her,
at
page
116
of
the
joint
appendix,
was
talking
about
she
was
upset
that
production
was
interrupted
and
they
had
to
compete
with
non-union
shops.
and
then
she
says,
"immigration
goes
by
in
the
car.
"
she
says,
"these
people
are
legal.
"
"they
don't
have
anything
to
fear.
"
"it's
just
the
idea,
i
guess,
they're
going
to
come
through.
"
"well,
do
you
fear
when
you
see
an
immigration
officer?
"
"not
when
i
see
them.
"
"i
don't
fear
for
me.
"
"it's
what
i
see.
"
i
think
these
individuals
are
quite
clear
about
what
is
going
on
and
what
kind
of
threat
the
survey
represents
to
them.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
they
have
standing
to
seek
an
injunction
on
the
ground
that
the
ninth
circuit...
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
right,
they
are
being
illegally
seized
and
they
are
exposed
to
a
threat,
and
given
the
number
of
illegal
aliens--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--probably
a
declaratory
judgment
would
suffice.
i
thought
you
were
raising
a
question
of
their
standing
to
obtain
an
adjudication
of
their
rights.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
are
exposed
to
a
future--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--we
won't
tell
you
when.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
given
the
results
that
we've
had
at
these
places,
they
are
likely
targets.
let
me
just...
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
of
davis
against
mississippi
and
i
do
think
that
that
is
a
very
different
case,
because
you
have
to
distinguish
between
this
hypothetical
group
seizure
that's
gone
on
here
and
the
question
of
the
seizure
and
arrest
in
davis
against
mississippi
of
an
individual.
and
i
agree
that
you
would
need
probable
cause,
under
dunaway
against
new
york,
a
well
settled
law,...
to
arrest
an
individual
you
would
need
reasonable
suspicion,
as
in
cortez,
to
make
a
seizure
of
a
particular
individual
suspected
of
an
offense,
suspected
of
being
subject
to
a
seizure.
but
this
theoretical
seizure
of
the
entire
work
force
is
a
totally
different
animal.
and
the
point
that
justice
stevens
was
getting
at
with
my
colleague,
suppose
that
they
had
identified
39
people
on
the
second
day
of
a
survey
by
name
who
were
present
and
they
had
gotten
a
warrant
naming
those
39
people.
they
would
still
have
employed
precisely
the
same
procedures
to
prevent
those
people
from
running
out
and
hiding
and
to
try
to
identify
who
they
were.
and
under
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit,
even
if
they
had
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause
they
would
still
be
violating
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
all
the
other
people
in
the
workplace.
so
there
simply
is...
well,
my
time
is
up.
