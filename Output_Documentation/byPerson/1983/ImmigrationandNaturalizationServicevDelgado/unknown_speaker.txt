unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
unknown
speaker
and
that
relates
to
whether
the
plaintiffs
here
in
the
case
below
had
standing
under
the
lyons
decision
of
this
court
last
time.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
don't,
but
why
not?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
likely
to
be
repeated
in
the
future,
assuming
the
practice?
unknown
speaker
is
there
something
in
the
record
about
that...
about
the
fact
that
these
aren't
just
random?
is
there
some
testimony
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
is
an
administrative
warrant
possible?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
situation
if
the
employees
were
working
on
a
paving
project
or
building
a
bridge
out
in
the
open...
no
enclosure
at
all?
unknown
speaker
could
a
warrant
be
obtained
to
check
out
in
open
spaces?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask?
this
may
be
a
far-out
hypothetical.
let's
suppose
you
have
a
study
of
a
given
neighborhood
and
the
study
was
that
the
probabilities
are
that...
it's
a
black
neighborhood...
that
20
to
25
percent
of
the
residents
of
that
neighborhood
have
committed
crimes.
that's
all.
and
then
the
police
launch
a
program
to
stop
and
interrogate
on
a
random
basis
all
of
the
blacks
in
the
neighborhood.
would
that
be
all
right,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
interrogations
were
random,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
in
the
sentence,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
we're
talking
only
about
the
interrogation
that
was
made.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
frey,
is
there
not
a
seizure
or
detention
when
the
agents
question
the
employee?
even
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
there's
no
overall
seizure
of
the
premises,
is
there
an
individual
seizure
if
a
person
is
detained
for
questioning?
unknown
speaker
if
he
says
it's
none
of
your
business,
you
don't
seize
him?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
the
person
refuses
to
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
what
if
there
is
a
particularized
suspicion
about
a
particular
person
and
the
agent
goes
up
to
him
and
says
"are
you
a
citizen"?
and
he
says,
"sorry,
i
won't
answer;
it's
none
of
your
business.
"
what
does
he
do
then?
unknown
speaker
he
hasn't
got
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
he
can
walk
away.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
well,
i
take
it
that
what
this
adds
up
to
is
a
statement
on
your
part
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prevent
officials,
police
or
others,
from
asking
questions.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
particularized
suspicion
but
not
probable
cause,
you
may
momentarily
detain
them
to
ask
a
question;
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
says
"get
your
hand
off
my
arm;
i'm
just
not
interested
in
answering
any
of
your
questions,
i'm
going
to
walk
away.
"
you've
got
to
let
him
walk
away?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
your
position
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
that's
required
here
is
not
reasonable
suspicion
of
illegal
presence
in
the
country,
but
merely
reasonable
suspicion
of
hispanic
origin?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you've
already
answered
me
that
you
say
the
questioning
does
not
involve
a
seizure.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
in
response
to
justice
white
it
might
involve
a
momentary
detention
of
the
terry-type
to
ask
questions.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
present,
does
it
not,
situations
where
individuals
were
questioned?
in
fact,
these
named
plaintiffs
were
questioned;
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
were
no
seizures
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
there
were
no
individual
seizures?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they...
what
do
the
agents
do
if
there
is
someone
that
they
want
to
ask
questions
and
the
person
just
leaves
the
premises?
will
they
be
followed
or
detained?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
point?
unknown
speaker
one
of
my
problems
is
that
i
think
that
what
one
might
normally
expect
in
the
way
of
findings
of
fact
are
really
quite
sparse
in
this
case.
are
the
findings...
do
the
findings
actually
spell
out
the
facts
as
you
portray
them?
or
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
that's
really
what
troubles
me.
unknown
speaker
but
should
we
have
to
look
at
the
testimony
in
a
case
of
this
kind
that
comes
in
this
way,
because
i
read
the
briefs
and
i
get
an
entirely
different
impression
of
the
facts
from
both
sides.
i
look
for
findings,
and
i
am
kind
of
at
a
loss.
unknown
speaker
and
in
a
summary
judgment
case
that
normally
isn't
true.
normally
the
people
are
willing
to
say
these
are
the
facts
and
you
can
decide
the
case
on
this
basis.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
happens,
for
example,
if
a
worker
during
work
hours
gets
up
and
walks
to
the
gate
where
an
agent
is
posted.
you
say
they
can
just
walk
right
out.
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
to
read
the
testimony
to
so
conclude,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
really
asking...
i
won't
take
your
time
up...
but
is
it
not
possibly
a
case
which
requires
some
findings
of
fact
to
know
exactly
what
should
be
done
with
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
position
there.
are
you
saying,
though,
that...
assume
we
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
they
went
too
far.
is
the
correct
disposition
to
reenter
the
summary
judgment
of
the
district
court
or
send
it
back
and
say
we've
got
to
know
more
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
is
that
your
position...
that
we
should
reenter
the
district
court's
summary
judgment?
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
just
objecting
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
whole
factory
is
seized?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
to
reach
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
and
then
we
remand
for
further
proceedings,
if
there
are
any.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
you
identified
two
separate
questions.
do
we
have
to
answer
both
of
them
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
evidence
is
there
that
individuals
were
declined
the
right
to
walk
away
from--
unknown
speaker
--when
you
handcuffed
somebody,
you
sort
of
seize
them,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
arguing
that
he
wasn't
seized.
unknown
speaker
whether
there
was
an
illegal
seizure.
unknown
speaker
are
these
agents
in
uniform?
unknown
speaker
they
were
free
to
leave,
too.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on--
unknown
speaker
--on
my
time,
if
i
have
any.
perhaps
you
were
in
the
court,
i
think
it
was
in
december,
when
we
had
the
case
of
sure-tan
against
the
nlrb
up
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
familiar
with
the
case,
i
am
sure.
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
law
of
the
united
states
that
an
employer
violates
no
crime
or
no
law
when
he
employs
aliens,
isn't
it?
mr.
frey
that's
correct.
and
here
the
solicitor
general,
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
sure-tan,
was
arguing
that
it
was
a
crime,
a
violation
of
the
nlrb,
for
the
employer
to
report
the
presence
of
an
illegal
alien.
and
here
today
you
are
arguing
for
precisely
the
opposite
result.
do
you
see
any
inconsistency
in
the
government
of
the
united
states--
unknown
speaker
--none
whatever?
unknown
speaker
none
whatever?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
talking--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
afraid
you've
misunderstood
the
import
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
policy
of
the
united
states.
i
know
you
don't
form
it
and
neither
do
we,
but
it
seems
very
curious
that
with--
unknown
speaker
--nine
million
americans
unemployed
in
the
united
states
that
the--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
like
for
you
to
understand
my
question.
i
said
at
the
outset
it
was
on
my
time
and
if
i
were
a
lawyer
i
would
do
what
the
law
requires
me
to
do,
and
i
hope
to
do
it
as
a
justice.
but
i
was
talking
only
about
the
policy
of
our
government
which
seems
to
be
to
be
quite
inconsistent.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
this
is
a
non-union
shop
we
are
dealing
with
here?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
union
shop.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton.
unknown
speaker
under
the
routine
of
the
workplace,
were
they
allowed
to
go
out
whenever
they
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
so
they
could
go
across
the
street
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee,
leave
for
the
day?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
rule...
did
the
employer
just
let
them
take
off
whenever
they
felt
like
it
during
working
hours?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
hear
the
last.
unknown
speaker
because
he
would
be
arrested.
but
my
question
was
whether
an
employer
at
either
of
these
places
permitted
his
employees
to
leave
the
shop
during
the
day,
walk
out
the
front
door
at
any
time.
unknown
speaker
day-to-day
in
his
employment.
the
answer
is
no,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
fenton,
may
i
interrupt?
there
are
really
three
kinds
of
individuals.
some
are
here
unlawfully
and
some
are
citizens
and
some
are
lawful
residents.
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
person
other
than
an
unlawful
alien
attempted
to
leave
the
factory
and
was
restrained
from
doing
so?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
whether
that
person
was
a
citizen
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
person
would
have
a
direct
remedy,
i
would
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
just
for
a
moment,
to
take
a
hypothetical,
supposing
we
had
some
magical
way
of
identifying
the
different
kind
of
persons
and
we
could
tell
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
all
of
the
unlawful
aliens
immediately
tried
to
leave
and
were
restrained
from
doing
so,
and
none
of
the
others
did.
would
you
still
say
that
the
others
were
seized?
unknown
speaker
but
part
of
the
point
that
justice
blackmun
makes,
i
think,
is
maybe
they
don't
really
have
any
motive
to
leave,
except
the
unlawful
people.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton,
is
this
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
i
said
is
it
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
good
is
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton,
your
brief
states
that
the
exits
were
sealed.
how
were
they
sealed?
unknown
speaker
that
sentence
states
"the
exits
are
sealed
and
guards
are
stationed.
"
but
what
you
saying
now,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
sealing
was
the
result
of
the
presence
of
the
agents.
unknown
speaker
yes.
these
were
ununiformed
and
unarmed?
unknown
speaker
is
there
evidence
of
more
than
one
person
being
handcuffed?
unknown
speaker
many
persons?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
evidence
indicate
whether
the
persons
handcuffed
were
handcuffed
after
probable
cause
had
been
found?
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
doesn't
address
that?
unknown
speaker
your
submission,
though,
generally
is
that
the
entire
work
force,
including
aliens
and
non-aliens,
was
seized?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton,
what
does
the
record
show...
and
perhaps
some
else
has
covered
this,
but
i
think
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion...
about
people
who
sought
to
leave
and
were
prevented
from
leaving
in
the
absence
of
any
showing
of
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
do
you--
unknown
speaker
--page
82.
but
we
don't
know
whether
those
five
people
there
were
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
them
or
not,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
suppose
an
agent
could
seek
to
question
them
on
the
way
out,
even
though
they
sought
to
get
out
as
soon
as
the
agents
came
in,
and
if
their
answers
revealed
anything
that
gave
reasonable
suspicion
that
would
be
reason
for
detainment.
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
reflect
it?
unknown
speaker
what
language
on
page
82
are
you
relying
on?
you
say
this
language
shows
that
they
were
not
only
interrogated,
might
have
been
interrogated,
but
they
were
prevented
from
leaving;
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
they
were
stopped.
well,
i
didn't
know
stopping
was
necessarily
a
seizure.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
so
under
our
cases
or
not?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
language?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
left
out
whether
they
were
running
and
trying
to
hide.
they
were
trying
to
hide,
according
to
the
testimony.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
he
describes
them
all
as
doing.
would
that
be
justification,
do
you
think,
for
asking
a
couple
of
questions?
unknown
speaker
which
ones
are
particularly
terrified?
unknown
speaker
which
ones
are
particularly
terrified?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
isn't
that
a
reasonable
inference
that
they're
the
ones
who
ought
to
be
questioned
and
stopped
for
a
moment?
wouldn't
that
itself
provide
the
articulable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
evidence
that
anyone
other
than
those
got
up
and
ran?
is
there
any
evidence
that
a
citizen
got
up
and
ran
when
somebody
walked
in
the
door?
unknown
speaker
it's
really
highly
unlikely,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
highly
unlikely
that
a
citizen
would
get
up
and
run?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton,
one
question.
it's
true
that
they
had
two
days
at
these
plants,
right?
unknown
speaker
there
were
two
separate
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
weren't
there
two
days
that
they
did
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
were...
the
people
you
are
talking
about...
were
so
scared
to
death,
why
did
they
come
back
the
second
day?
unknown
speaker
it
was
later.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
were
so
scared,
they
did
come
back
in
the
place
to
work.
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
gone
back
to
mexico
and
made
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
i
thought
justice
stevens
asked
you
to
name
one
point
in
the
record
that
said
a
citizen
was
involved.
unknown
speaker
what
would
their--
--well,
how
can
you
apprehend
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
evidence
that
that
took
place,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
do
we
know
about
the
probable
cause
or
suspicion
that
the
agents
had
with
respect
to
that
one
worker?
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
to
contend
that
if
the
person
responds
and
says
"no,
i
am
not
a
citizen
and
i
do
not
have
a
work
permit.
"
that
there's
something
wrong
with
taking
them
into
custody,
including
handcuffing
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
reasonable
cause,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fenton,
your
position,
i
think,
on
behalf
of
your
clients
is
the
same
even
if
there's
all
the
basis
in
the
world
to
go
in.
you're
not
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
employer
that
you
have
no
right
to
come
in
the
factory
and
usually,
as
i
understand
it,
the
employer
consents.
unknown
speaker
but
you
make
the
same
argument
even
if
50
percent
of
the
people
in
the
factory
were
well
known
to
be
unlawful
aliens
and
the
other
50
would
still
make
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--could
they
follow
precisely...
they
don't
know
which
50
percent
it
is.
could
they
follow
precisely
the
procedure
they
followed
here
if
they
had
a
100
percent
certainty
that
50
percent
of
the
work
force
was
illegal
aliens?
could
they
follow
this
procedure
then?
unknown
speaker
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rights
of
the
remainder
are
unaffected
by
the
number
of
people
they
suspect.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
might
think
there's
one
armed
robber
in
the
factory
and
follow
a
similar
procedure.
unknown
speaker
but
you
might
go
through
and
ask
everybody
to
show
your
driver's
license,
look
for...
i
mean,
anybody
that's
at
least
reasonably
close
in
size
and
dimensions
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
might
ask
each
one
who
seeks
to
leave
at
the
time
he
leaves,
"can
i
see
your
driver's
license?
"
they
wouldn't
have
to
stay
there
two
hours
unless
it
gets
awfully
crowded
in
front.
unknown
speaker
i
gather,
mr.
fenton,
you
don't
find
any
support
for
your
position
in
davis
v.
mississippi.
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
cited
it
or
relied
on
it.
i
wondered.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
hypothetical
question:
suppose
they
weren't
looking
for
aliens
but
the
police
simply
stationed
a
car
at
the
exit
of
the
parking
lot
at
a
factory.
the
first
question:
all
the
persons
coming
to
take
a
car
off
were
asked
to
exhibit
their
driver's
license.
do
you
think
that
would
be
all
right,
or
would
they
be
seized?
unknown
speaker
i'm
limiting
my
hypothetical
to
people
who
are
approaching
a
parking
lot
ostensibly,
apparently,
to
take
a
car,
and
they
are
asked
at
that
time
to
exhibit
their
driver's
license.
that's
all
right,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
how
about,
then,
when
they're
driving
out
and
they
stop
them
as
they
are
driving
out
and
say
now
you're
driving
your
car,
let
me
see
your
license.
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
martinez-fuerte?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
the
closest
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
to
have
standing
you
have
to
say
it
is
anticipated;
otherwise
you'd
be
in
the
lyons
situation
and
your
clients
wouldn't
have
standing.
so
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
yes,
we
know
this
is
going
to
happen
and
it's
going
to
recur;
therefore,
we
have
standing.
so
where's
the
surprise?
unknown
speaker
would
martinez-fuerte
be
different
if
the
government
didn't
maintain
its
checkpoint
at
the
same
place
every
day
of
the
year?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
wasn't
martinez-fuerte
on
the
highway
between
san
diego
and
los
angeles?
unknown
speaker
so
that
it's
hard
to
say
it
was
the
border
because
people
headed
north
from
san
diego
had
to
pass
through
that
stop.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
have
needed
the
reasoning
it
used
in
martinez-fuerte
to
justify
the
stop
if
it
had
been
a
traditional
border
stop
where
you
can
stop
anybody,
regardless
of
any
sort
of
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
and
searched
them.
unknown
speaker
what...
tell
me,
what
standing
do
your
clients
have
to
seek
an
injunction?
is
it
because
it
may
happen
to
them
again?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
odds
on
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know,
but
at
this
plant?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
union
isn't
in
the
case
any
more.
unknown
speaker
does
the
number
of
people
affected
really
matter
if
we
don't
have
a
class
action
and
there
are
four
individuals?
unknown
speaker
it
sure
does
if
you're
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
but
don't
we
have
to
decide
the
specific
controversy
between
the
four
individuals
and
the
government?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this:
i
take
it
one
of
the
interests
at
least
of
some
of
the
individuals,
according
to
the
testimony,
was
concern
about
their
friends
because
they
obviously
had
some
sympathy
with
the
people
who
were
being
arrested.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
say,
do
you
rely
on
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
it's
only
concern
about
their
own
well-being
that
would
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
are
all
four
of
the
parties
still
in
the
country?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
find?
violated
what
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
what
right?
unknown
speaker
did
they
say
fourth
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
were
they
addressing
this
particular--
unknown
speaker
--your
time
has
expired,
counsel.
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frey?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
what
standing
do
these
four
people
have
to
seek
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
that
may
be
true
that
they
were
exposed
to
a
threat
if
the
ninth
circuit's
right,
but
how
about
an
injunction?
doesn't
that...
don't
they
have
to
really,
if
they're
going
to
have--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
why
have
then
even
got
standing
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment?
that
speaks
to
the
future.
unknown
speaker
does
the
government
represent
they
are
going
to
sweep
this
particular
factory
again?
unknown
speaker
no,
of
course,
not,
but
you
are
going
to...
the
likelihood
is--
