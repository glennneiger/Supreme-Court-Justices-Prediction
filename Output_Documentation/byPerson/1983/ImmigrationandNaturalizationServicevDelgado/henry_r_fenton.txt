mr.
henry
r.
fenton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
ins
workplace
surveys
or
raids
which
are
carried
on
on
a
nationwide
basis.
the
government
concedes
that
the
three
surveys
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
were
carried
out
substantially
in
the
same
way
as
they
carry
out
surveys
throughout
the
country.
we
submit
that
as
part
of
that
program
of
ins
surveys
the
respondents...
two
united
states
citizens
born
in
this
country
and
two
legal
resident
aliens,
one
of
whom
has
resided
here
since
1944
and
was
raised
in
this
country,
the
other
of
whom
resided
in
this
country
for
some
15
years
at
the
time
of
the
surveys
in
1977...
were
seized
and
were
questioned
along
with
their
co-workers
in
three
surveys
that
occurred
in
1977.
my
argument
is
basically
divided
into
three
parts.
first,
i
will
argue
that
the
respondents
were
seized;
secondly,
that
they
were
unreasonably
seized;
and,
finally,
that
the
appropriate
standard
for
seizure
in
such
a
setting
is
reasonable
suspicion
of
illegal
alienage.
now
i
think
that
any
common
sense
appraisal
of
the
record
indicates
that
these
people
were
actually
seized
and
that
they
are
seized
in
the
course
of
these
surveys.
in
excess
of
20
and
perhaps
as
many
as
30
ins
officers
took
part
in
the
surveys.
in
one
of
the
surveys
they
were
accompanied
by
uniformed
los
angeles
police
department
agents.
now
they
entered
into
the
factory.
they
came
in
suddenly.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
employees.
and
some
of
them
immediately
stationed
themselves
inside
the
factory,
in
the
doorways,
so
that
the
employees
could
see
that
they
were
there.
there
was
no
question
about
that.
in
fact,
respondents...
the
record
is
clear
that
respondents
said
that
they
saw
the
agents
position
themselves.
for
example,
delgado
said
that,
82...
"i
started
looking
up
toward
the
front
and
then
i
seen
people
with
badges
being
stationed
by
the
doors.
"
"they
wouldn't
let
nobody
go
out.
"
and
then
delgado
described
that
five
people
were
stopped
at
the
doorway
by
ins
agents
and
were
prevented
from
going
in.
mrs.
miramontes,
another
respondent,
in
another
survey...
again
this
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
survey
even
before
the
questioning
begins...
saw
somebody
try
and
go
out
and
the
agent
responded
ins
retained
a
portion
of
the
tee-shirt.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
they
were
allowed
to
go
out
whenever
they
wanted
to,
certainly.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
that
was
their
freedom
as
american
citizens,
certainly.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
no,
the
employer
didn't,
but
i
think
our
point
is
that
in
a
free
society
in
that
setting
if
they
had
known
in
advance
the
kind
of
intrusion
they
would
have
been
subjected
to,
i
would
submit
that
a
reasonable
worker
under
those
circumstances
would
have
chosen
not
to
remain
at
work,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
would
have
chosen
not
to
remain
at
work.
it
was
a
very
intrusive--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--is
your
honor...
is
the
question
directed
toward
the
time
of
the
surveys
or
just
generally?
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
presumably
the
workers
have
to
remain
at
work,
it's
true,
other
than
at
breaks
and
at
lunch,
if
that's
the
purport
of
the
question.
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
the...
those
people
were
forced
to
remain
and
if
they
had
chosen
not
to
remain
they
had
to
remain
because
of
the
force
and
because
of
the
show
of
authority
that
was
going
on
around
them.
they
had
no
choice
in
the
matter,
and
i
think
in
a
free
society
even
though
we
all
have
to
work
and
make
a
living
we
have
a
right
to
walk
out
the
door.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
the
only
evidence
was
this
one
instance
that
mr.
frey
referred
to
where
someone
was
handcuffed
and
then
the
handcuffs
were
taken
off.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
the
person
indicated
that
he
or
she
was
a
citizen,
was
disbelieved,
evidently,
was
handcuffed,
and
subsequently
the
handcuffs
were
removed.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
suppose
so,
but
i
submit
that
the
other
workers
were
seized
as
well,
under
any
test,
whether
it's
the
test--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--i
would,
your
honor,
because
i
think
to
the
average
worker
you're
talking
about
people
who
are
basically
unskilled
people
and
you
have
to
look
at
it
from
their
vantage
point...
the
vantage
point
of
the
average
worker.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
when
they
see
people
being
handcuffed
at
the
outset
and
they
see
law
enforcement
officers
there,
i
think
they
may
very
well
have
a
motive
to
leave,
and
i
think
the
reason
that
they
are
forced
to
remain
is
simply
because
they
see
that
if
they
do
leave
they
themselves
might
be
suspected
of
being
illegal
aliens,
or
they
themselves
might
be
handcuffed.
they
themselves
may
place
themselves
in
a
position
where
they
could
possibly
be
deported.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
it
was
originally
class...
it
was
originally
a
class
action.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
no,
it's
not.
it
was
not
certified.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
ninth...
the
importance
of
it
is
that
these
surveys
are
continuing
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
wasn't
just
these
individual
respondents
who
were
seized
but
it
was
everybody
in
the
factory.
the
law
suit
was
brought
on
behalf
of
the
union
and
the
workers
that
it
represented,
everyone
in
those
factories.
the
union
really
is
technically
a
party,
although
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
deal
with
the
question
of
the
dismissal
of
the
union.
so
we
think
that
it
is
important
that
in
addition
to
the
respondents
the
other
people
were
seized
as
well.
but
we
submit
that
these
respondents
were
seized
and
that
it
was
apparent
to
them
that
they
couldn't
leave.
now
mr.
frey
suggests
that
two
people
walked
out
the
door.
i
think
the
record
really
doesn't
suggest
that.
what
happened
was
in
one
instance
mrs.
correa,
after
the
questioning
was
over,
mustered
up
the
courage
to
walk
over
and
talk
to
an
ins
agent,
but
she
never
left
the
custody
of
any
of
the
ins
agents.
so
there
was
really
never
any
attempt
to
leave
and
get
away
when
ins
agents
were
present.
the
other
situation
involved
mr.
delgado,
and
the
record
simply
reflects
that
he
either
directed
someone
to
go
to
the
loading
dock
or
he
himself
went
to
the
loading
dock.
but,
once
again,
the
crucial
point
is
that
he
never
tried
to
leave,
nor
did
he
leave
the
custody
of
the
ins
agents
in
the
factory
because
he
felt
compelled
to
remain
not
only
because
of
the
people
who
were
stationed
there,
but
because
there
was
a
large
force
of
agents
who
were
systematically
questioning
people
in
a
manner
which
would
suggest
that
everyone
was
under
suspicion
and
everyone
must
remain.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
they
were
sealed
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
agents
were
stationed
there
and
actually
physically
prevented
people
from
leaving
the
factory.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
the
agents
were...
they
were
armed,
but
the
arms
were
concealed.
they
carried
handcuffs
which
were
visibly
displayed,
which
the
respondents
could
see
and
the
workers
could
see.
they
were
handcuffing
people,
which
again
suggested
to
the
workers
that
they
had
better
cooperate.
it
wasn't
simply
an
encounter
in
an
airport
with
one
or
two
ununiformed
agents.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
there's
evidence
of
many
persons
being--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--yes.
in
fact,
i
think--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
i
think
the
record
essentially
suggests
that
the
people
who
tried
to
flee
were
handcuffed,
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
reflect
anything
beyond
that.
the
people
who
tried
to
run
away
or
tried
to
hide
were
handcuffed.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
position
based
upon
all
the
circumstances,
not
just
the
sealing
of
the
exits.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
okay.
well,
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
is,
as
i
said
before...
and
i
can
refer
to
it...
is,
for
example,
delgado
saw
five
people
being
stopped
at
the
back
door.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
that's
at
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
we
know
that
at
this
point
in
time
the
agents
had
just
come
into
the
factory
and
these
were
people
who
were
simply
trying
to
leave,
but
they
hadn't
done
anything
suspicious
other
than
be
present
in
the
factory.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
don't
think
that
was
the
situation
here,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
no,
i
think
the
record
reflects
these
people
simply
tried
to
get
out
before
they
were
questioned.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
it's
at
the
appendix,
page
82,
i
believe.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
they
were
prevented
from...
well,
the
language
only
says
that--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
i
think
that
under
these
circumstances
if
one
tries
to
leave
one's
place
of
employment
and
one
is
stopped
at
the
door...
that's
the
way
i
interpret
this...
and
prevented
from
leaving
the
premises,
then
one
is
seized,
and
in
my
view
one's
free--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
it's
this
language.
he
saw
people.
he
says
that
he
saw
people
running,
about
10
to
20.
"where
did
they
run
to"?
"toward"...
that's
in
the
middle
of
the
page...
"toward
the
back
of
the
building.
"
"did
they
run
as
a
group?
"
"no".
"did
you
see
any
of
these
people
try
to
go
out
any
door?
"
"yes".
and
then
he
says...
then
he
says:
"what
happened
when
these
people
tried
to
get
out
the
door?
"
"well,
every
door
was
covered.
"
"how
many
of
these
people
did
you
see
try
to
get
out
a
door?
"
"i
saw
five
trying
to
get
out
the
back
emergency
exit,
but
they
were
stopped.
"
that
was
the
testimony
i
was
referring
to.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
these
people,
i
think,
we
trying
to
get
out.
some
were
trying
to
hide.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
think
if...
in
an
instance
like
that
basically
i
think
that
workers
are
terrified
and
while
under
ordinary
circumstances--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
particularly
perhaps
the
illegal
aliens.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
that...
not
necessarily,
because
in
this--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--no,
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
the
point
is
that
a
u.s....
the
u.s.
citizens,
the
respondents
at
least,
didn't
try
to
leave,
whether
it
was
by
running
or
walking.
i
think
it
probably
is
unlikely
that
a
citizen
would
run,
but
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
in
that
setting
that
a
citizen
would
be
frightened
sufficiently
by
the
survey,
would
be
frightened
of
being
mistaken
for
an
illegal
alien,
that
he
or
she
might
run.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
because
the
basis
for
handcuffing,
the
apparent
basis
for
handcuffing,
i
would
submit,
was
that
the
person
tried
to
leave
and
hispanic
appearance
of
the
people.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
there
were...
well,
there
were
two
separate
plants.
there
were
two
surveys.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
there
was
a
nine-month--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--yes,
at
one
of
the
plants;
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
the
second
survey
wasn't
on
the
second
day.
it
was
some
nine
months
later,
your
honor.
in
other
words--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--it
was
several
months
later.
it
wasn't
the
following
day.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
they
had
to
make
a
living,
but,
you
know,
i
submit
that
they
were
afraid.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
and
the
record
reflects,
your
honor,
that...
well,
i'm
talking
about
u.s.
citizens
and
legal
residents,
and
the
record
reflects
that
these
people,
not
the
illegal
aliens...
i'm
not
talking
about
those
people.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
citizens
remained
within
the
factory.
the
respondents
were
citizens
and
resident
aliens
and
mrs.
correa,
one
of
the
respondents,
testified
that
when
the
agents
left
she
spent
some
45
minutes
calming
down
citizens
and
legal
residents
who
were
crying
because
they
were
so
upset
about
what
was
going
on
and
were
so
frightened
that
they
might
have
been
apprehended
and
so
forth.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
for
fear
that
they
themselves
might
have
been
mistaken
as
an
illegal
alien.
for
example,
if
one
were
to
identify
oneself
as
an
illegal
alien,
a
hispanic,
and
were
disbelieved,
presumably
one
could
be
handcuffed,
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
workers.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
there
was
one
instance
of
this
one
worker
who
was
handcuffed
and
then
later
the
handcuffs
were
taken
off.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
we
don't,
but--
one
further
point
with
respect
to
the
seizure
that
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
an
admission
in
the
record
that
in
fact
the
people
were
stationed
in
the
doorways
to
keep
everyone
inside.
assistant
director
smith
stated
that
the
agents
were
placed
there
"in
order
to
guarantee
that
individuals
will
not
escape.
"
and
this
is
at
page
48
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i'm
saying
that
if
there's
reasonable
cause,
if
there
were
reasonable
cause
to
believe--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
our
point
is,
first
of
all,
that
those
people
are
seized
before
any
questioning
even
begins,
so
that
there's
a
seizure
before
there's
any
particularized
or
objective
basis
of
suspicion.
contrary
to
what
mr.
frey
says,
the
record
reflects
that
there
is...
that
in
90
percent
of
the
cases,
as
he
says,
these
surveys
are
carried
out
with
the
permission
of
the
employer,
but
there's
no
pattern
to
it.
sometimes
there'll
be
an
anonymous
tip
and
they'll
go
to
a
particular
place
of
employment
based
on
an
anonymous
tip.
in
the
davis
pleating
surveys
where
there
was
a
warrant...
and
perhaps
in
ten
percent
of
the
cases
there's
a
warrant
to
permit
entry
into
the
factory...
the
only
basis
for
the
raid
was
that
three
illegal
aliens
were
apprehended
outside
the
factory.
one
of
them
said
that
she
believed
there
were
five
illegal
aliens
in
the
factory,
based
on
her
conversations
with
people
in
the
factory.
another
one
said
that
she
thought
there
were
many.
the
third
said
she
thought
there
were
18.
none
of
them
would
identify
anyone
in
the
factory
or
name
any
illegal
aliens
in
the
factory.
the
other
basis
for
the
raid,
which
captured
a
population
of
300
people,
was
that
the
ins
agent
involved
stated
that
he
saw
20
persons
of
a...
and
these
were
his
words...
"of
apparent
latin
appearance"
walk
into
the
factory.
so
there
really
is
no
basis
before
the
agents
go
in
there,
no
objective
or
particularized
basis
for--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
we're
arguing...
that's
true,
but
we're
arguing
that
the
people
are
seized,
that
my
clients
were
seized
without
any--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--but
if
50
percent
of
the...
i
would
make
that
if
there
were
no
specific...
if
there
were
no
particularized
and
objective
basis
beforehand
to
go
in
and
seize
those
people,
and
after
the
fact
they
were
determined
that
50
percent
were
illegal
aliens.
yes,
that
would
be
my
point.
however,
if
the
government,
if
the
ins
had
a
particularized
and
objective
belief
that
50
percent
of
the
people
in
there
were
illegal
aliens,
certainly
they
would
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
detain
those
individuals
and
question
them,
but
that's
never
the
case
in
these
surveys.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
think
not.
i
think
it
would
violate
the
rights
of
the
remaining
50
percent,
but
that--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
again
in
the
one
armed
robber
situation
you'd
have
some...
you'd
be
looking
for
that
one
armed
robber.
you'd
have
a
description
or
something
of
that
sort.
the
evil
of
these
raids--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--but
you
wouldn't
permit
the
police
to,
for
example,
to
seal
off
an
apartment
store
to
look
for
a
shoplifter
and
have
police
officers
march
up
and
down
the
aisles
of
the
department
store
and
keep
people
there
for
two
hours
to
look
for
shoplifters.
i
think
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
those
people.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
our
situation
is
totally
different.
it's
simply
not
that
kind
of
situation.
now
the
surveys,
we
submit,
violate
the
fourth
amendment
first
of
all
because
they
closely
resemble
the
general
searches
and
the
bills
of
attainder
that
were
carried
out
by
the
british
as
part
of
our
pre-revolutionary
history.
again,
in
those
cases,
although
here
we're
talking
about
places
of
employment,
we're
talking
about
indiscriminate
seizures
of
people
so
that
you
can
question
them
and
find
some
guilty
people.
there
the
british
would
go
into
an
area
without
suspecting
anyone
in
particular
of
customs
violations
and
they
would,
based
upon
generalized
warrants,
seize
people.
we
submit
that
the
surveys
per
se
violate
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
resemble
those
bills
of
attainder
and
generalized
searches.
moreover,
there's
no
particularized
suspicion
nor
adherence
to
any
objective
standard
and
we
submit--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--your
honor,
i
think
that
davis
versus
mississippi
does
support
our
position,
and
there,
again,
there
was--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
it
is
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
your
honor,
but
we
do
believe
that
it
does
support
our
position
and
that
in
that
case
again
the
court
held
that
simply
because
people
were...
simply
because
one
was
black
and
a
group
of
blacks
were
arrested
that
that
was
not
a
particularized
basis
to
suspect
that
someone
was
guilty
of
a
crime.
so
we
do
feel
that
that
case
supports
our
position.
we
feel
that
u.s.
versus
cortez
is
even
more
on
point
and
this
court
held
that
it's
necessary
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
particular
persons
seized
be
guilty
of
wrongdoing
and
that
that
was
the
essential
teaching
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
think
that
if
you
had
one
or
two
officers
who
were,
say,
outside
the
factory
and
simply
asked
people
to
look
at,
that
might
be
a
different
case
because
you
just
don't...
you
don't
have
the
tremendous
coercive
impact
that
you
do
of
this
entire
apparatus
that
appeared
in
the
course
of
the
survey.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
no,
i
think
not.
i
think
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
i
think
under
delaware
versus
krause
if
they're
going
to
stop
a
car
they
must
have...
the
police
must
have
a
particularized
and
objective
basis
of
suspicion,
so
i
think
that
would
not
be
all
right.
now
the
government
contends
that
the
government
interest
that's
involved
justifies
these
wholesale
violations
of
rights
and
we
submit
that
this
court
has
already
considered
the
national
interest
that
they
purport
is
served
here
in
the
brignoni-ponce
and
cortez
cases,
and
determined
that
a
very
minimum
particularized
basis
of
suspicion
and
a
suspicion
of
illegal
alienage
is
required.
so
that
question
has
already
been
considered
by
this
court.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
your
honor,
i
think
the
martinez-fuerte
is
an
entirely
situation...
it's
sui
generis
and
doesn't
really
apply
to
any
other
situation.
there,
the
court--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--yes,
it
is.
if
i
may
discuss
it,
the
situation
there
involved
a
permanent
checkpoint
which
had
been
in
place
for
some
24
years.
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
very
minimal
subjective
intrusion
because
all
motorists
using
that
highway
know
it's
there.
i
personally
use
that
road
all
the
time,
practically
every
week,
and
all
you
do
is
slow
down,
and
you
know
that
that
is
all
that's
going
to
happen.
the
court
contrasted
that
very
minimal
subjective
intrusion
to
the
very
substantial
intrusion
involved
in
roving
stops
by
border
patrols.
this
particular
situation
is
much
more
analogous
to
a
roving
stop.
it's
a
surprise
entry
by
these
officers;
it's
totally
unanticipated.
and,
in
fact,
it's
far
more
intrusive,
far
more--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
while
these
particular
individuals
may
know
that
at
some
point
in
time
it
may
recur,
they
certainly
don't
know
that
it's
going
to
recur
at
any
particular
point
in
time.
they
don't
know
necessarily
that
it's
going
to
recur.
i
think
that
our
standing
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
government
has
admitted
that
they're
going
to
continue
engaging
in
these
surveys.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
think
the
decision
would
have
been
different.
i
think
it
was
crucial
to
the
decision,
and
this
court
said
that
you
had
a
very
minimal
subjective
intrusion.
very
little
fear,
very
little
anxiety
was
engendered
by
the
checkpoint,
since
it
was
permanently
there
and
everyone
knew
that
it
was
there.
this
court
also
held
that
one
has
a
much
lower
expectation
of
privacy
in
an
automobile
and
everyone
expects
to
be
stopped
once
in
a
while
for
vehicle...
for
traffic
tickets
and
so
forth
by
law
enforcement
agents.
and
another
factor,
another
crucial
distinguishing
factor,
i
think,
in
martinez-fuerte
is
that
really
it
was
an
extension
of
the
border.
it
was
at
the
junction
of
two
highways
leading
away
from
the
border
and
i
think
that's
a
totally
different
situation.
as
the
court
said
in
almeida-sanchez,
to
protect
our
borders
you
have
really
different
kinds
of
fourth
amendment
considerations
that
are
involved.
this
is...
these
surveys
occurred
within
our
central
cities.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
it's
not
technically
the
border,
but
i
think
it's
an
adjunct
to
the
border.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
recognize
that,
your
honor.
i'm
just
saying
that
that
was
a
factor.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
think
the
crucial
point
was
that
it
was
a
very
minimal
subjective
intrusion.
here
we
have
a
very
substantial
subjective
intrusion.
i
think
the
record
bears
this
out
in
that
respect.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
it
may
happen
to
them
again.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
the
government
has
indicated
they
intend
to
engage
in
further
surveys
in
these
particular
factories.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
that's
what
they
said.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
moreover,
the
law
suit
was...
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position
they
didn't
even
have
to
reach
the
standing
of
the
union
and
the
union
suit
for...
on
behalf
of
workers
they
represented.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
they
really
are
in
the
case
even
though
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
deal
with
the
standing
question.
but
i
think
the
crucial
point
is
that
these
surveys
are
continuing
and
we
submit
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
each
year
are...
have
their
rights
violated
by
virtue
of
these
surveys,
so
that
it's
crucial
that...
so
that
you
really
do
have
a
question
here
beyond
the
situation
of
these
four
respondents.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
balancing,
if
one
balances
the
national
interest,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
effect
that
this
has
on
people
in
this
country.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
also
in
terms
of
the
notion
of
whether
or
not
these
surveys
are
reasonable,
the
government
raises
national
considerations,
national
policy
considerations,
and
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
also
to
consider
the
impact
on
the
individuals,
the
interests
of
the
individuals
who
are
subjected
to
these
surveys.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
well,
we're
not...
i
think
that's
extraneous.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
no.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
absolutely.
i
don't
think
that
has
a
thing
to
do
with
the
case.
our
point
is
that--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--yes,
your
honor.
well,
they
are
citizens
and
as
fat
as
i
know
they
are,
yes.
now
again
in
considering
the
reasonableness
of
the
seizure,
it's
appropriate
to
examine
whether
or
not
there
are
alternative
means
of
enforcement
available
to
the
ins
to
solve
the
problems
that
they
assert
exist,
and
we
submit
that
there
certainly
are.
first
of
all,
ins
workplace
surveys
have
never
been
seriously
proposed
as
any
portion
of
the
solution
to
our
immigration
problems.
in
fact,
the
select
commission
suggested
a
number
of
alternatives
to
solve
our
problems
and
surveys
were
not
among
them.
the
select
commission
even
said
that
any
massive
program
of
deportation
would
violate
civil
rights,
and
the
u.
s.
civil
rights
commission
found
these
surveys
to
be
violative
of
civil
rights.
beyond
that,
your
honor--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--well,
the
u.s.
civil
rights
commission.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
fourth
amendment
rights.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
no,
they
were
not.
they
were
not
addressing
these
particular
surveys,
but
they
were
addressing
surveys
just
like
the
ones
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
now
the
other
point
is
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
ins
can't
engage
in
the
normal
kinds
of
law
enforcement
functions
that
other
law
enforcement
officers
engage
in.
the
record
reflects
that--
mr.
henry
r.
fenton
--yes.
thank
you.
