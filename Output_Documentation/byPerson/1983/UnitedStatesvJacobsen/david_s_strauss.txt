mr.
david
s
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
law
enforcement
officers
must
obtain
a
search
warrant
before
they
conduct
a
chemical
analysis
of
a
substance
that
is
lawfully
in
their
possession
to
determine
whether
it
is
an
illegal
or
controlled
drug.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
typical
of
narcotics
prosecutions.
in
may
1981
the
employees
of
federal
express,
which
is
a
private
freight
carrier,
opened
a
cardboard
package
addressed
to
respondents
that
had
been
given
to
federal
express
for
shipment.
inside
the
package
was
a
tube
wrapped
in
gray
tape.
the
federal
express
employees
cut
open
the
tube
and
removed
from
inside
of
it
a
transparent
container
that
consisted
of
four
plastic
bags,
one
inside
the
other.
inside
the
innermost
plastic
bag
was
a
white
powder.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
federal
express
employees
undertook
all
these
actions
on
their
own
without
any
governmental
involvement
whatever.
the
federal
express
employees
suspected
that
the
white
powder
might
be
an
illegal
drug
and--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--they
did
not
open
the
plastic
bag,
that's
right.
mr.
david
s
strauss
i
think
it's
absolutely
clear
that
at
that
point
probable
cause
existed.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that's
right.
because
it
was
a
white
powder
packaged--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--yes.
i
don't
think
people
send
baking
soda
or
sugar
or
talcum
powder
through
federal
express
wrapped
in
four
plastic
bags
like
that;
or
at
least
the
probability
of
their
doing
so
is
small
enough
so
this
constitutes
probable
cause.
in
fact,
if
this
didn't
constitute
probable
cause,
then
you're
in
the
paradoxical
situation...
it's
one
of
the
oddities
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion...
that
the
court
apparently
thought
that
law
enforcement
officers
were
in
the
position
that
they
couldn't
do
anything.
they
would
simply
have
had
to
allow
this
shipment
to
go
through.
they
couldn't
seize
it,
they
couldn't
test
it.
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
would
simply
have
had
to
walk
away
at
this
point.
mr.
david
s
strauss
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
because
there
existed
probable
cause
to--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--yes.
mr.
david
s
strauss
in
my
view
it
would,
yes,
because
it
would
establish
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
was
contraband,
probably
cocaine,
and
after
delivery
there
would
be
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
cocaine.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
actually
not
just--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--well,
they
conduct
a
field
test,
that's
right.
and
every
other
court
that
has
looked
at
this
situation
has
not
had
any
difficulty
with
their
conducting
a
field
test,
and
the
field
test,
of
course--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--no.
i
think--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--i
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
bag
were
opaque.
mr.
david
s
strauss
because
the
court
said
in
arkansas
against
sanders
that
certain
containers
don't
support
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
their
contents
is
immediately--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--well,
at
least
certain
opaque
containers.
if,
say,
it
were
an
attache
case
or
something
like
that,
probable
cause,
of
course,
is
not--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--well,
the
question
would
be
whether
under
what
the
court
said
in
arkansas
against
sanders
that
container
supported
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
now,
an
opaque
plastic
bag
i
think
would
be
a
borderline
case.
a
transparent
plastic
bag
is
not
a
borderline
case.
a
transparent
plastic
bag
is
the
best
example
of
a
container
that,
to
quote
the
court's
words
in
arkansas
against
sanders,
"containers
that
by
their
very
nature
cannot
support
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
because
their
contents
can
be
inferred
from
their
outward
appearance.
"
there
is
no
inference
going
on
here.
the
contents
were
immediately
apparent
from
the
outside...
from
the
outward
appearance
because
the
container
was
transparent.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that's
right.
but
there's
no
question
at
all
those
things
were
lawfully
apparent
to
the
dea
agents
when
they
arrived.
mr.
david
s
strauss
oh,
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
david
s
strauss
i
think
those
containers
are
ordinarily
opaque.
mr.
david
s
strauss
in
fact,
the
court
went
on
to
say
in
arkansas
against
sanders,
"similarly,
in
some
cases
the
contents
of
a
package
will
be
open
to
plain
view,
thus
obviating
the
need
for
a
warrant.
"
now,
the
contents
of
this
package
were
open
to
plain
view,
and
that
obviated
the
need
for
us
to
obtain
a
warrant
to
open
the
transparent
container.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
the
plain
view
exception
authorized
the...
authorized
the
agents
to
take
a
few
grains
of
cocaine.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that's
right.
to
open
the
bag
and
take
a
few
grains.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that's
right.
that
leaves
the
question
of
the
test.
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
the
principal
issue
in
the
case.
now,
before
i
get
to
the
merits
of
the
test,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
why
we
considered
this
issue
to
be
of
considerable
importance.
the
chemical
analyses
of
substances
suspected
of
being
narcotics
are
absolutely
routine
in
narcotics
prosecutions.
they
are
undertaken
in
virtually
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
cases
a
year.
and
to
hold
that
every
time
a
chemical
analysis
is
undertaken
of
a
substance
that
the...
the
possessor
of
which
has
not
consented
to
the
analysis
in
some
way,
that
every
time
that
occurs,
a
warrant
must
be
obtained.
mr.
david
s
strauss
no,
we
don't
need
probable...
it's
not
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
david
s
strauss
i...
that...
that
is
our
position,
justice
white.
i
think
that
is
the
right
view.
now,
let
me
say
as
i
say
that
that...
that
we
don't
think
and
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
say
that
there
is
no
circumstance
at
all--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--well,
that...
that
is,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
there
couldn't
be
some
circumstance
in
which
someone
could
make
it
clear
that
they
attach
unusual
privacy
values
to
a
substance.
maybe
justice
rehnquist's
example
is
a
good
example.
if
it
were
clear
that
this
was
a--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--an
ashes
urn,
something
which
had
unusual
privacy
attributes,
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
say
that
some
such
extraordinary
case
might
not
come
along
in
which
we
would
be
required
to
have
some
quantum
of
suspicion.
but
this
is
clearly
not
that
case.
no
one
suggested
that
a
white
powder
package
like
this
in
a
transparent
container
shipped
like
this
had
the
privacy
attributes
associated
with
someone's
ashes
in
an
urn.
and--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--yes,
yes.
i...
well,
i--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--oh,
yes,
certainly,
a
fortiori,
if
we
have
probable
cause.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
in
this
case
and
in
a
case
similar
to
it
we
will
have
probable
cause.
there
may
be
many
instances
in
which
we
would
have
suspicion
not
amounting
to
probable
cause.
we
might
come
across
a
substance
like
this
in
the
course
of
a
search
incident
to
arrest
or
of
a
car
search.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
there
is...
there
was
undoubtedly
probable
cause
in
this
case.
and
if
the
court's
view
is
that
we
need
probable
cause
to
conduct
this
test,
we
are
entitled
to
win
this
case.
but
there
are
instances
in
which
substances...
where
you
have
only
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
substance
is
contraband,
and
to
require
warrants
in
those
cases
would,
we
think,
not
serve...
or
to
require
probable
cause
in
those
cases
would,
we
think,
not
serve
the
interests--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--it's
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the...
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
david
s
strauss
not
quite,
justice
stevens.
it
did
not...
it
did
not
supply
all
of
the
details
of
the
package.
mr.
david
s
strauss
it
is
conceivable.
mr.
david
s
strauss
it
is
no
more
than
that.
we
don't
think
that's
right.
mr.
david
s
strauss
oh,
yes.
i
mean
we...
we
presumably
could
have
obtained
a
warrant
to
search
the
house
without
the
field
test,
and
then
the
search
of
the
house--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--that's
exactly
right.
and
that
is
often
the
function
that
these
field
tests
serve.
i
mean
very
often
that
is
true.
very
often
the
investigation
could
go
forward
quite
properly
without
the
field
test,
and
it
is
better--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--sometimes
it
couldn't.
sometimes--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--sometimes
the
next
action
the
officers
would
take
would
require
more
than
reasonable
suspicion.
but
very
often,
as
in
this
case,
the
officers
could
have
gone
forward
without
it
and
search
the
house.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
they
are
undoubtedly
different,
mr.
chief
justice.
and,
for
example,
the
sight
of
white
sugar
in
a
sugar
bowl
would
not
authorize
an
arrest
of
the
persons
in
possession
of
the
sugar
bowl,
because
they
wouldn't
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it
was
cocaine.
but
i
think
that's
a
good
example
of
why
a
field
test
simply
does
not
invade
significant
expectations
of
privacy.
i
don't
think
any
reasonable
person
would
object
if
in
the
course
of
a
search
of
his
house
the
police
officers
took
a
pinch
of
sugar
and
exposed
it
to
some
chemicals
to
see
if
it
was
cocaine.
i
mean
his
house
is
being
searched,
after
all,
pursuant
to
a
warrant,
by
hypothesis
lawfully.
and
that
additional--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--no.
our
argument
is
not
that
the
warrant
authorized
the
search
of
the
sugar
bowl.
our
argument
is
that
the
testing
of
a
few
grains
of
sugar
is
not
a
search,
because
no
reasonable
person
would
think
that
his
privacy
had
been
additionally
invaded
by
that
action.
after
all,
what
will
they
discover?
they
will
discover
that
what
was
in
the
sugar
bowl
was
sugar,
which
is
what
it
was
labeled
as
from
the
beginning.
they
simply
haven't
invaded
that
person's
privacy
by
learning
that
he
keeps
sugar
in
his
sugar
bowl.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
this...
this
is
one
of
those
investigative
techniques
that
invades
principally
the
privacy...
and
i
put
"privacy"
in
quotation
marks...
of
guilty
persons,
of
persons
who
are
concealing
contraband,
who
are
trying
to
ship
contraband.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
people
are
innocent
until
they
are
proven
guilty.
mr.
david
s
strauss
no,
of
course
i
pay
attention
to
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
people
are
innocent
until
proven
guilty.
but
i
think
there
is
a
meaningful
sense
in
which
we
can
say
that
a
person
in
possession
who...
whom
you
and
i
would
agree
is
in
possession
of
contraband,
is
a
guilty
person.
and
it
was
only
in
that
sense
that
i
was
using
the
term.
no
one
is
suggesting
that
consequences
be
visited
on
these
people
on
the
basis
of
a
field
test.
mr.
david
s
strauss
that
is
a
matter
of
some
dispute
in
the
record,
and
i
believe
the
district
court
did
not--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--resolve
it.
because
he
viewed
it
as
immaterial,
and
i
think
he
was
right,
justice
stevens.
there
is
no
question
that
the
dea
agent...
that
the
federal
express
employees
summoned
the
dea
agents
for
the
purpose
of
showing
them
the
white
powder.
and
whether
they
showed
it
to
them
by
taking
it
out
of
the
bag
and
showing
it
to
them
in
their
hands
or
simply
by
saying
it's
over
there
in
the
bag,
go
take
it
out
for
yourselves,
can't
be
a
matter
of
constitutional
significance.
mr.
david
s
strauss
well,
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
is
a...
that
was
a
different
situation
where
the...
the
law
enforcement
agents
came
across
the
information...
the
viewing
of
the
film
in
that
case...
not
because
a
private
person
showed
it
to
them
or
wanted
to
show
it
to
them,
but
simply
because
the
private
person
happened
also
to
have
done
it.
where
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
private
person
deliberately
intends
to
reveal
something
to
law
enforcement
officers,
the
precise
way
in
which
he
reveals
it
i
think
is
immaterial.
in
burdeau
against
mcdowell,
which
is,
of
course,
the
fountainhead
of
the
private
search
doctrine,
the
private
party
sent
some
documents
to
the
government.
now,
i'm
sure
they
didn't
send
it
to
them
in
a
way
that
the
contents
of
every
document
was
available...
was
immediately
apparent
on
plain
view
at
a
glance.
i'm
sure
they
sent
it
to
them
in
a
stack,
and
the
government
agents
had
to
leap
over
some
documents.
but
there
is
no
question
in
that
case
the
government
was
entitled
to
look
at
all
the
documents.
mr.
david
s
strauss
your
hypothesis--
mr.
david
s
strauss
--your
hypothesis
was...
yes,
it
would
be
our
view
that
he
does,
yes,
that's
right.
i
think
the
best
way
to
understand
what
a
truly
minimal
intrusion
a
chemical
analysis
is
is
to
use
the
court
of
appeals'
own
analogy,
which
was,
of
course,
to
the
walther
case
where
the
court
held
narrowly
that
the
viewing
of
a
film
was
a
search
subject
to
the
warrant
clause.
viewing
a
film
belonging
to
another
person
or
listening
to
another
person's
tape
cassette,
which
is
a
similar
activity,
is
vastly
more
intrusive
than
conducting
a
chemical
analysis.
a
film
or
a
tape
can
reveal
a
great
deal
about
a
person's
interests
or
tastes
or
thoughts
or
associations
or
political
views
or
private
life.
and
a
chemical
analysis
does
not
reveal
anything
comparable,
because
people
simply
don't
lock
their
secrets
into
the
molecular
structure
of
a
substance
in
the
way
that
they
might
place
private
thoughts
on
a
tape,
or
private
activities
on
a
film,
or
private
effects
in
a
locked
container.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
respondents
had
not
been
implicated
in
a
shipment
of
cocaine,
a
chemical
analysis
of
that
substance
that
the
dea
agents...
the
federal
express
people
and
the
dea
agents
found,
might
have
revealed
that
the
white
powder
wasn't
sugar,
which
is
what
it
first
appeared
to
be,
but
was
actually
baking
soda
or
talcum
powder.
now,
it's
just
not
the
kind
of
invasion
of
privacy
that
reasonable
people
care
about.
and
there
is
no
basis
for
comparing
that
to
the
far
more
intrusive
law
enforcement
measures
that
the
fourth
amendment
properly
regulates.
now,
as
i
understand
respondents'
position,
they
don't
squarely
join
issue
with
us
on
the
question
of
whether
the
chemical
analysis
was
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
they
instead
seem
to
think
that
it
was
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
chemical
analysis...
the
opening
of
the
plastic
bag
and
the
extracting
of
a
few
grains
of
the
substance...
that
constituted
a
search.
mr.
david
s
strauss
yes.
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect,
justice
blackmun.
less
than
a
gram
and
a
trace
amount
i
believe
were
the
descriptions
the
agent
used.
as
i
said
before,
this
was
the
opening
of
a
transparent
container
which
is
the
quintessential
example
of
a
container
that
can't
support
an
expectation
of
privacy.
the
example
the
court
used
in
arkansas
against
sanders
was
a
gun
case,
but
however
much
a
gun
case
reveals
from
the
outside
about
its
contents,
a
transparent
container
reveals
much
more.
and
if
a
gun
case
can't
support
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
then,
a
fortiori,
a
transparent
container
cannot.
and
the
next
thing
they
did
was
to
extract
a
few
grains.
in
our
view
this
was
simply
de
minimis,
and
therefore,
not
within
the
fourth
amendment.
but
if
it
wasn't
de
minimis,
there
is
no
possible
sense
in
which
it
was
a
search.
it
must
have
been
at
most
a
seizure.
and
the
court
has
said
many
times,
twice
last
term
alone,
that
a
seizure
can
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
and
as
i
said,
it's
clear
that
the
agents
had
probable
cause
here.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
s
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
just
two
points
of
clarification.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
our
submission
and
concludes
that
this
is
in
fact
a
search,
it
does
not
follow,
as...
as
has
been
suggested
during
my
friend's
argument,
that...
it
certainly
does
not
follow
that
we
have
to
obtain
a
warrant
which,
as
i
said,
would
be
extraordinarily
burdensome;
and
it
doesn't
even
follow
that
we
have
to
have
probable
cause,
because
the
privacy
interests
are
so
limited...
we
think
so
limited
they're
not
a
search.
but
if
the
court
concludes
otherwise,
reasonable
suspicion
would
surely
be
enough
to
justify
this
sort
of
limited
invasion.
the
second
point
is
that
when
considering
whether
the
chemical
analysis
is
a
search,
it's
important
to
remember
that
we're
talking
about
substances
that
are
already
lawfully
in
the
possession
of
the
agents.
that
means
they
can
hold
it
in
their
fingers,
they
can
feel
its
texture,
they
can
hold
it
up
to
the
light,
they
can
taste
it,
they
can
smell
it.
i
suppose
in
this
case
they
could
even
have
used
it
the
way
cocaine
users
use
it...
all
without
even
conceivably
violating
any
other
fourth
amendment
interest.
and
in
light
of
that,
it
seems
to
make
little
sense
to
say
that
they
couldn't
take
the
more
precise
and
obviously
more
desirable
step
of
conducting
a
chemical
analysis.
thank
you.
