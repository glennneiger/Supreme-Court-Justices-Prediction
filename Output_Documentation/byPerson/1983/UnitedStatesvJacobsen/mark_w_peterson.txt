mr.
mark
w.
peterson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
must
confess
that
the
government
and
the
respondents
view
the
issue
in
this
case
as
being
totally
different.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
police
officers
are
required
to
get
a
search
warrant
every
time
they
want
to
submit
a
suspected
contraband
substance
to
testing;
and
rather,
the
only
issue
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
police
officers
who
lawfully
come
into
possession
of
a...
of
an
item
which
was
subjected
to
a
prior
private
search
may
extend
the
scope
of
that
search
without
obtaining
a
search
warrant,
assuming
that
no
exception
is
present.
the
result
which
we
maintain
and
which
was--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--no,
i
do
not
concede
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
indicated,
the
search
warrant
affidavit
is
not
before
this
court.
it
was
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
they
specifically
stated
in
their
opinion
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
results
of
the
field
test,
there
would
not
have
been
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
search
warrant.
and
therefore,
because
that...
that
particular
finding
has
not
been
challenged
here
except
by
implication,
i
do
not
make
that
concession.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
if
we
assume
that
the
narcotics
agents
viewed
the
same
thing
that
the
federal
express
people
did
and
put
in--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--they
did
view
the
same
thing,
but
the...
i
simply
can't
recall
what
was
in
the
affidavit.
but
if
we
make
those
assumptions
and
if
the
case
had
been
decided
after
illinois
v.
gates,
i
think
it's
a
likely
possibility
that
the
warrant
may
have
been
issued.
but
that
simply
is
not
before
the
court
at
this--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--that's...
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
is
my
view
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
that
is
accurate.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
no.
we
have...
we
have
conceded,
both
in
our
brief
and
below,
that
the
appearance
of
the
white
powder
in
the
plastic
baggies
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
provided
reasonable
grounds
for
a
seizure,
but
that
is
a
totally
different
question
from
the
question
which
we
submit--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--in
all
likelihood,
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
if
they
had
seized
it,
presented
the
facts
known
to
them
at
the
time
to
a
united
states
magistrate.
there's
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
they
would
have
obtained
a
warrant
for
the
entry
of
the
packages--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--correct.
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make
earlier
is
that
the
result
which
we
maintain
in
this
case
would
not
require
search
warrants
for
all
chemical
tests,
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
valid
for
other
reasons,
usually
because
there's
a
prior
fourth
amendment
justification
for
the
testing
itself.
we
are
submitting
that
a
search
warrant
is
only
necessary
when
the
government
expands
the
scope
of
a
prior
private
warrantless
search.
now,
our
position
here
is
very
simply
stated:
that
being
that
the
opening
of
the
baggies,
the
withdrawing
of
the
substances
and
the
chemical
testing
does
in
fact
constitute
a
search.
there
was
no
warrant
present.
those
items
were
discovered
in
a
previously
sealed
and
wrapped
package
which
is
clearly
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
therefore,
because
there
was
no
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
present,
walther
and
a
litany
of
this
court's
decisions
require
the
holding
that
the
search
was
invalid.
i
would
also
submit
to
this
court
that
following
walther
will
further
an
important
goal
which
has
been
identified
at
a
number
of
this
court's
recent
fourth
amendment
decisions.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
you
follow
justice
stevens'
opinion.
i
am
not
here
arguing
the...
the
basis
for
the
holding
which
justice
white
would
have
reached
in
his
concurring
opinion.
and
i
think
that
the
items
which
were
focused
upon
by
the
four
dissenters
in
that
case
are
not
present
in
this
case.
in
particular,
the
fact
that
one
of
the
major
points
made
in
the
dissenting
opinion
was
the
fact
that
the
condition
of
the
packages
or
the
containers
within
which
were
the
films
at
the
time
the
fbi
was
contacted
to
come
and
look
at
them
was
brought
on
by
actions
of
the
consignor
of
the
packages
themselves;
in
other
words,
sending
it
to
a
fictitious
address,
not
picking
it
up
for
a
lengthy
period
of
time.
the
point
being
what
was
the
recipient
of
the
packages
supposed
to
do
except
to
try
to
find
out
who
they
belonged
to.
and
we
simply
don't
have
that
situation
here.
the
condition
of
the
package
at
the
time
the
dea
came
upon
it
was
due
to
circumstances
which
were
entirely
beyond
the
control
of
the
respondents.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
perhaps
is
correct,
but
i
believe
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record...
and
i
confess
i
can't
recall
if
it's
in
the
joint
appendix...
that
the
damaged
package
was
due
to
the
actions
of
federal
express
because
it
was
punctured
with
a
forklift
or
something
like
that.
in
any
event,
there
were
circumstances
beyond
their
control.
the
standard
which
i
was
mentioning
before
and
which
the
court
has
identified
as
important
is
a
single
familiar
standard
to
guide
the
police
who
are
out
in
the
field
making
on-the-spot
decisions,
and
they
have
to
know
what
rule
is
going
to
control
their
behavior.
i
would
submit
that
by
following
walther
in
this
case,
that
standard
will
be
not
only
reaffirmed
but
also
be
made
clearer.
it's
very
simple.
after
private
parties
have
conducted
a
search
of
an
item
such
as
a
package,
the
police
can
examine
it
to
the
same
extent
that
the
private
parties
did,
but
they
can
go
no
further
if
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
particular
item
without
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
it's
simple,
it's
identifiable,
and
it's
easily
implemented;
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
followed
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
the...
the
simplistic
response
to
your
question,
justice
stevens,
is
that
they
should
call
the
private
party
and
find
out.
when
you're
dealing
with
private
papers,
of
course,
you
do
have...
you
have
another
problem
because
of
the
possible
fifth
amendment
implications
of
your
activity.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
prudent
thing
to
do
in
that
situation
would
be
to
since
you
have
the
item
in
your
exclusive
possession,
dominion
and
control
anyway,
there's
no
danger
that
you're
going
to
lose
any
of
it
or
the
potential
defendant
is
going
to
take
it
from
you.
you
just
go
get
a
search
warrant,
particularly
when
search
warrants
are
so
easily
obtainable.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
yes.
i
can
seize...
i
concede,
excuse
me,
justice
rehnquist,
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
seize
it
at
that
time,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
should
have
done
and
then
gone
to
get
a
warrant
which
they
got
within
a
hour
anyway.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
no.
the
seizure
does
not
fail.
they
clearly
had
the
right
and
in
fact
the
duty
to
be
in
possession
of
that
package.
it
was
obviously
suspicious
to
them.
but
they
should
have
done
nothing
further
with
it
until
they
got
a
warrant
if
they
were
going
to
physically
enter
the
package
further
than
the
federal
express
people
had
entered
it
and
then
conduct
a
scientific
examination;
in
fact,
destroy
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
process.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
is
our
position.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
the...
and
i'm
going
to
get
hung
up
in
words
here...
they
could
open
the...
the
big
package
itself--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--it's...
it's
my
position
that
they
should
not
have
opened
the
plastic
bags
themselves
because
they
had
not
been
previously
opened.
they
should
have
not
gone
inside
the
plastic
bags,
they
shouldn't
have
taken
anything
out,
and
they
shouldn't
have
subjected
it
to
a
chemical
test.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
is
my
submission,
justice
white.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
based
upon
the
information
that
they
had
from
federal
express,
based
upon
the
appearance
of
the
container--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--they
certainly
could
have.
and
as
i
think
i...
i
indicated
before,
they
probably
would
have
gotten
one.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
is
a
question,
justice
rehnquist,
which
i
think
would
probably
be
answered
based
upon
this
court's
decisions
in
new
york
v.
belton
and
united
states
v.
robinson.
in
robinson,
as
you
will
recall,
the
court
held
that
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
you
can
search
the
entire
person
of
the
person
arrested,
and
in
that
case
the
issue
was
whether
you
could
search
a
rumpled...
rumpled
up
cigarette
package
containing
cocaine.
in
belton
the
issue
was
the
permissible
scope
of
a
search
incident
to
a
valid
arrest
in
an
automobile.
you
held
that
you
could
search
the
entire
interior
or
the
automobile,
all
the
containers
found
within,
and
i
believe
the
person
as
well.
so
if...
if
that
issue
were
to
arise
based
on
those
two
decisions
primarily,
the
holding
would
probably
be
that
no
warrant
would
be
required.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
if
mr.
peterson
were
present,
he
would
tell
the
pusher
that
you
weren't
listening
to
what
i
was
saying,
because--
[laughter]
--once
you
sold
that
heroin
or
whatever
it
was
to
the
informant
or
cooperating
individual
or
whatever,
you
relinquished
your
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
package,
you
didn't
care
what
he
did
with
it,
in
fact,
you
probably
never
wanted
to
see
it
again;
so
you
had
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
and
you
have
no
basis
for
claiming
that
your
rights
were
violated
by
what
he
did
with
that
package.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
it
does
because
there...
and
the
other
examples
of
field
tests
or
chemical
tests
of
contraband,
which
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
and
several
of
which
i
did
set
forth
in
my
brief,
there
is
a
prior
fourth
amendment
justification
for
the
search
which
is
involved,
whether
it
be
a
valid
search
warrant,
a
hand-to-hand
buy
or
what
have
you.
and,
therefore,
i
think
it's
accurate
to
say
that
this
situation
just
does
not
arise
that
frequently.
one
thing
that
i
think
should
be
discussed
here
is
the
expectation
of
privacy
which
one
has
in
packages,
and
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
as
early
as
ex
parte
jackson,
recently
reaffirmed
in
place.
there
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
sealed
containers
traveling
via
common
carrier.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
thing
regarding
this
case,
that
being
that
as
stated
in
the
opinion
in
the
walther
decision,
a
person's
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
package
which
is
shipped
by
a
common
carrier
is
established
at
the
time
that
it
is
shipped,
not
at
the
time
that
it
is
searched
by
somebody,
whether
it
be
the
fbi
or
someone
else.
and
i
think
it's
worth
noting
that
the
government
has
never
challenged
that
language
in
walther;
they
have
never
addressed
our
assertion
that
that
is
in
fact
the
law.
and
assuming
that
this
court
still
accepts
that
position,
it's
clear
that
the
search
here
was
a
search
of
a
package,
and
therefore,
under
chadwick
and
any
number
of
other
decisions,
it
was
illegal.
the
government
also
suggests
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
this
case
because
there's
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
molecular
structure
of
contraband.
once
again,
we're
dealing
with
the
expectation
in
the
package
itself,
not
what
that
package
contains,
and--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--there
may
be
very
little
privacy
interest
left,
justice
rehnquist.
and
in
this
case,
as
it
turned
out,
perhaps
the
only
privacy
interest
left
was
the
molecular
structure
of
the
substance.
but
in
another
case
there
might
be
personal
papers
in
the
package,
there
might
be
other--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--well,
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
government
stated
every
time
you
see
white
powder
in
plastic
baggies,
that's
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
contraband.
and--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--the
only
point
i
was
making
is
that
if
you...
if
you
assume
that
the
presence
of
such
a
plastic
baggie
in
a
package
provides
probable
cause
to
seize
that
package,
then
whatever
else
is
in
there,
if
it
is
anything
else,
apparently
you
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
either.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
maybe
that
is
the
case.
in
any
event,
i
disagree
with
the
government's
contention
that
a
plastic
baggie
containing
powder
or
any
transparent
container
of
powder
is
so
uniquely
attributable
to
contraband
that
you
can
automatically
seize
it
and
search
it.
but
in
this
case,
as
i've
stated
before,
i
have
conceded
the
propriety
of
the
seizure
of
the
bag.
it's
what
they
did
with
the
bag
afterwards
that
i
am
concerned
about.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
excuse
me.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
it
might
be
a
search
which
is
valid
under
the
border
search
exception
if
it
were
going
to--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--okay.
assuming
that
the
border
search
exception
does
not
apply,
i
think
the
argument
can
be
made
that
clearly
you
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
package.
the
question
is
whether
due
to
the
suspicious
circumstances
which
you
described,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
should
be
an
exception
allowing
examination.
the
argument
can
be
made
that
that
is
in
fact
a
search
because
it
is
a
scientific
entry
of
a
place
where
you
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
but
due
to
essentially,
i
guess,
the
exigency
of
the
situation
and
the
suspicious
circumstances,
it
may
not
be
held
to
be
a
search.
i
guess
it's
probably
closer
to
the
dog
sniffing
situation
in
united
states
v.
place,
which
although
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
a
search
because
there
was
no
physical--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
and
although
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
clearly
explicated
in
that...
that
opinion,
that
perhaps
is
the
basis
for
it.
there
is
no...
there
was
no
physical
entry
of
the
suitcase
which
was
sniffed,
and
it
was
in
a
public
place,
and
certainly
there
was
no
destruction
of
any
of
the
contents
of
the
suitcase.
so
i
don't
think
that
supports
the
fact
that
there
was
no
search
here.
i
think
it's
been
clearly
recognized
by
this
court
that
although
containers
or
packages
are
the
items
in
which
privacy
expectation
is
recognized,
the
true
principal
privacy
interest
is
in
the
contents
themselves,
as
recognized
in
chadwick.
secondly,
the
government
has
suggested
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
contraband
or
the
molecular
structure
of
contraband.
they
cite
no
cases
in
support
of
that
proposition.
i
would
submit
that
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
jeffers,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
plus
a
number
of
other
cases
where
there
were
an
expectation
of
privacy...
in
pornographic
films,
or
drugs,
or
illegal
phone
calls,
illegal
coins,
what
have
you...
has
been
found
would
support
our
position
that
the
government
is
simply
incorrect.
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
so-called
plain
view
doctrine
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
my
basic
position
is
that
it
simply
is
irrelevant,
and
it
does
not
apply
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
application
of
the
plain
view
doctrine
ignores
the
fact
that
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
respondents
is
based
upon
the
condition
of
the
package
at
the
time
it
was
sent
and
not
afterwards.
but
even
setting
that
aside,
the
plain
view
doctrine
applies
to
seizures.
and
as
i've
stated
before,
i've
never
challenged
the
seizure
in
this
case.
the
police
were
in
lawful
possession
of
the
package
itself.
now,
at
one
point
the
government
in
its
brief
calls
the
entry
of
the
packages
and
the
testing
just
another
seizure
in
addition
to
the
one
which
had
already
taken
place.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
just
playing
with
semantics,
and
it
just
doesn't
make
any
common
sense.
the
government
also
cites
the
decision
in
united
states
v.
lisk,
which
is
an
opinion
of
justice
stevens
when
he
was
a
circuit
court
judge.
there
he
stated,
among
other
things,
that
a
search
involves
an
invasion
of
privacy;
a
seizure
is
a
taking
of
property.
i
would
submit
in
this
case
that
the
package
was
seized
when
the
dea
came
into
possession
of
it.
everything
that
happened
after
that
was
a
search.
the
fact
that
what
the
dea
did
to
the
package
was
a
search
is
supported
by
cardwell
v.
lewis
where
the
taking
of
paint
scrapings
was
a
search;
cupp
v.
murphy
where
the
taking
of
fingernail
scrapings
was
a
search--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--and
the
agents
just
dumped
the
powder
out
to
test
it?
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
guess
my
case
might
be
a
little
bit
more
difficult,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
crucial
had
it
happened
that
way.
the
second
reason
that
plain
view
does
not
apply
in
this
case
is
that
it's
well
established
that
in
order
for
plain
view
to
apply,
there's
got
to
be
an
antecedent
fourth
amendment
justification
for
the
police
officers'
presence.
that
clearly
did
not
exist
here.
they
weren't
present
to
execute
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest
or
anything
else.
they
were
only
here
to
seize
the
package,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
prior
justification.
the
third
element
is
that
their
discovery
of
the
evidence
must
be
inadvertent,
as
recently
established
again
in
texas
v.
brown.
in
other
words,
they
can't
have
known
in
advance
that
they
were
going
to
seize
the
item
that
they
seize.
here
they
clearly
did
know
about
it
beforehand,
and
they
found
exactly
what
they
were
looking
for.
therefore,
we
contend
that
plain
view,
which
only
applies
to
seizures
anyway,
simply
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
in
conclusion,
we...
we
submit
that
this
case
is
governed
not
only
by
walther
v.
united
states
but
other
well-established
and
longstanding
decisions
recognizing
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
packages;
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
