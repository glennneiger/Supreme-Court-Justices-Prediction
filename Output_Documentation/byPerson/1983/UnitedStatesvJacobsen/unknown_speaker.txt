unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't...
they
didn't
open
the
plastic
bag.
unknown
speaker
would
the
existence
of
the
bag
in
that
condition
amount
to,
in
your
view,
immediately
apparent
incriminating
material
to
authorize
a
plain
view
seizure?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
any
white
powder
package
like
that,
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it's
contraband?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
knowledge
they
had
acquired
at
that
time
before
the
testing,
just
the
observation,
would
have
been
sufficient
to
support
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
to
search
the
house
after
they
made
the
controlled
delivery?
unknown
speaker
i
was
asking
the
question.
is
it...
would
it
support
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
it
would.
unknown
speaker
is
that...
there
must
be
a
lot
of
cases
then
supporting
your
view
that
any
time
you
see
a
white
powder
in
plastic
bags,
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
it's
contraband.
are
there
a
lot
of
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
does
anybody
ever
get
a
warrant
when
they
see
white
powder
in
a
plastic
bag,
or
do
they
just
automatically
open
up
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
field
test
is
one
thing,
but
getting
in
the
bag...
getting
in
the
bag
is
another.
i
take
it
your
position
wouldn't
be
any
different
if
the
bag
had
been
not
transparent
but
opaque.
and
yet
you
had...
suppose
you
had
had
private
information,
reliable
private
information
that
there
was
cocaine
in
that
bag;
namely,
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
cocaine
in
the
bag,
which
is
no
different
than
the
kind
of
probable
cause
you
say
existed
here
where
it
was
transparent.
unknown
speaker
could
you
then...
could
you
then
open
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
yeah,
but
what
if
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
cocaine
in
that
opaque
bag?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
an
opaque
plastic
bag,
and
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
cocaine
in
it.
could
you
tear
it
open
and
field
test
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is...
it's
just
not
the
contents,
but
it's
the
fact
they're
wrapped
up
in
a
plastic
bag
and
shipped
by
federal
express.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
you
have
a
search
warrant
for
an
apartment
to
hunt
for
some
object
and
you
run
into
a
white
powder
sitting
around
in
a
glass
somewhere
that
that's
immediately
sizeable
as
cocaine,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
somebody's
ashes.
unknown
speaker
an
urn.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
plain
view
exception
just
covers
this
case
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
to
open
the
bag
and
take
a
few
grains.
unknown
speaker
that
still
leaves
a
question
of
the
test.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you...
you
agree
before
the
test
should
be
administered
that
you
at
least
ought
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it's
contraband
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
in
my
example
when
you're
searching
the
apartment
for
a
stolen
piano,
you
see
on
the...
you
see
on
a
shelf
a
white
powder
in
a
glass,
you
can
just
take
a
pinch
of
it
and
test
it,
even
though
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
whatsoever
that
it's
contraband.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are,
though.
you
are,
though.
you're
saying
that
it's
not
a
search
at
all
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment
to
field
test
any
white
powder
that
you
find
anywhere.
unknown
speaker
an
ashes
urn?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
you
claim
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it
was
cocaine
or
was
a
drug.
unknown
speaker
and
at
least
in
those
cases
you
think
you
ought
to
be
able
to
field
test.
unknown
speaker
but
how...
how
much
difference
does...
do
the
two
alternate
methods
of
analysis
make,
because
your
position
is
that
every
time
you
see
white
powder
wrapped
in
several
sacks
in
transit,
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
it's
contraband.
so
that
there
really
isn't
any
independent
determination
or
additional
factual
determination
that
you
make
once
you
have
those
facts
before
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
ought
to
wait
until
we
get
a
case
like
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
record?
does
the
warrant
application
appear
in
the
record,
and
if
so,
where,
in
the
materials
before
us?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
assuming,
because
otherwise
i
have
difficulty
understanding
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
warrant
application
did
not
spell
out
the
elements
of
probable
cause
other
than
the
results
of
the
field
test?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
conceivable
that
the
warrant
application
would
not
have
been
sufficient
without
including
the...
it's
conceivable.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
make
an
admission
on
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
had
ample
probable
cause
apart
from
the
field
test,
i
imagine
you
could
protect
yourself
by
filling
out
a
warrant
application
that
did
not
rely
on
the
field
test.
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
circumstance
the
field
test
really
would
just
have
served
to
protect
the...
the
owner
of
the
powder
from
the
risk
that
you
were
making
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
but
often
it
couldn't.
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
just
reasonable
suspicion.
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
agents
who
are
searching
the
premises
for
the
piano
that
justice
white
suggested,
and
in
the
kitchen
of
the
house
they
see
a
sugar
bowl
with
sugar.
do
you
distinguish
that
from...
on
the...
the
basis
that
white
substances
in
a
sugar
bowl
in
a
kitchen
of
a
private
home
are
somewhat
different
from
a
white
powdered
substance
encased
in
three
or
four
plastic
bags
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
you
don't
search
a
sugar
bowl
for
a
stolen
piano.
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
this
problem
is...
becomes
complicated
because
when
it's
discovered
that
it's
just
sugar,
the
householder
doesn't
complain;
it's
only
when
they
discover
that
it's
marijuana
or
heroin
that
the
complaint
begins.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
people
were
innocent
until
they
were
proved
guilty.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
obviously
you
don't...
you
don't
pay
any
attention
to
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
record?
at
the
time
the
bags
or
the
article
was
given
to
the
dea
agent
by
the
federal
express
was
the
white
powder
visible?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
resolve
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
if
you
followed
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
walther
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
would
it
be
your
view
that
any
time
an
officer
comes
in
to
lawful
possession
of
an
item
which
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
is
incriminating
that
the
officer
is
entitled
to
subject
that
item
to
any
scientific
test?
or
maybe
it's
a
blood
stain,
maybe
it's
in
this
case
cocaine.
but
any
scientific
test
to
determine
its
true
composition?
unknown
speaker
without...
without
a
warrant
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
established
it
takes
just
a
few
grains?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede...
do
you
concede,
mr.
peterson,
that
had
the
information
that's
described
in
this
record
been
presented
to
a
magistrate
before
they
did
the
testing,
a
warrant
would
properly
issue
for
the
opening
of
the
bag
and
the
testing
of
the
contents?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
a
warrant
could
have
been
issued
without
the
testing,
a
warrant
issued
for
the
search
of
the
house
after
they
made
a
controlled
delivery,
on
the
information
that
is
now
available?
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's...
that's
in...
that's
this
record,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
we...
you
think
we...
as
the
case
comes
here
there...
there's
been
a
holding
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
prior
to
the
testing,
and
that's
the
way
we
should
judge
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
way
the
government
then
can
win
the
case
is
by
our
holding
that
the...
that
the
testing
is
not
a
search
at
all
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
quite
fair
to
the
eighth
circuit.
wasn't
their
precise
holding
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
set
forth
in
the
application
for
a
warrant?
i
mean
they
didn't
hold
that
the
facts
could
not
have...
might
not
amount
to
probable
cause
if
they'd
been
assembled
and
presented
in
a
different
warrant
application.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about...
but
your
position
is
that...
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
just
from
looking
at
this
white
powder
in
plastic
bags.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you...
you
think
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
then.
they
just...
from
looking
at
the
powder
in
these
bags.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you...
a
valid
warrant.
unknown
speaker
which
of
the
prevailing
opinions
in
walther
do
you
suggest
that
we
follow?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they'd
sent
it
in
a
better
package,
perhaps
it
wouldn't
have
broken
open.
unknown
speaker
then
how
do
you
respond
to
your
opponent's
argument
based
on
burdeau
against
mcdowell
that
this
stack
of
papers
were
turned
over
to
the...
to
the
government,
and
they
don't
really
know
the
extent
to
which
the
private
party
might
have
read
all
those
papers?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
you
say
it's
your
position,
i
gather,
mr.
peterson,
that
the
government
could
search
to
the
same
extent
that
the
fea
people
had
searched;
so
that
would
have
left
them
at
the
most
extreme
point
of
the
fea's...
looking
at
a
clear
plastic
bag
with
powder
inside.
now,
do
you
concede
at
that
point
that
they
would
have
had
probable
cause
to
seize
that
as
contraband?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
although
they
had
probable
cause,
since
they
did
not
have
a
warrant,
the...
the
seizure
fails
because
that
is
the
kind
of
seizure
for
which
a
warrant
is
required?
unknown
speaker
so
they...
they
could
seize
it
under
probable
cause,
but
they
couldn't
further
penetrate
its
nature,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
its
molecular
structure
without
getting
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
a
separate
point
is
they
couldn't
open
the
package
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
could
they
open
the
plastic
bag?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
be
here
even
if
the
bag...
if
one
of
the
plastic
bags
had
been
opened
and
the...
they
still
couldn't
have
done
anything
but
seize
and
then
get
a
warrant
to
do
the
test.
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
applied
for
a
warrant
at
that
stage
without
opening
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
the
appearance
of
the
container.
unknown
speaker
they
would
have
gotten
it.
in
your
brief...
i
believe
it
was
in
your
brief,
mr.
peterson;
perhaps
it
was
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion...
the
position
is
taken
that
this
case
is
fairly
unique
and
that
most
field
tests
simply
wouldn't
present
this
problem
because
they're
bags
that
are
seized
from
someone
who
is
arrested
as
a
result
of
a
search.
but
under
your
analysis
i
would
think
even
though
it's
seized
as
a
result
of
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
wouldn't
you
still
need
a
warrant
to
conduct
a
field
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
peterson,
suppose...
suppose
the
government
has
an
informant...
has
an
undercover
agent
and
he
goes
around
and
buys...
and
is...
and
buys
some
drugs
off
of
a
pusher.
and
he
comes
back
and
says
i've
just
bought
this
drug,
paid
$100
for
it,
and
so
the
government
goes
and
arrests
the
pusher,
and
they
indict
him,
and
at
the
trial
they
offer
the
drug
in
evidence.
and
they
put
on
an
expert
and
say
yes,
this
is
really...
this
is
really
a
drug.
and
the
pusher
gets
up
and
says
i've
been
talking
to
mr.
peterson,
and
this
evidence
is
not
admissible
because
they
didn't
have
a
warrant
to
test
the
drug.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
the
same
rationale
vaguely
could
apply
to
incident
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
there
was
probable
cause
to
seize
the
package
because
of
a
belief
that
it
had
contraband.
how
much
privacy
interest
is
left
in
the
package
after...
because
of
just
looking
at
it
you
can
have
probable
cause
to
seize
it
for
contraband?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in...
in
that
case
it
might
well
be
that
there
wouldn't
be
probable
cause
to
seize
the
package
or
the
papers
because
it
wouldn't
be
at
all
evident
that
they
were
contraband.
i
don't
believe
the
government
here
takes
the
position
that
just
because
you
can
see
into
the...
see
the
outline
of
the
contents
that's
probable
cause
to
seize
it.
it
has
to
be
something
a
good
deal
more
suspicious
than
that.
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
say
every
time
you
see
papers
in
a
plastic
sack
it's
cause
to
believe
it's
contraband.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
the
government's
submission
was
based
just
on
the
fact
it
was
a
baggie,
but
that
you
could
see
a
white
powder
in
a
baggie,
and
that
the
combination
was
what
gave
you
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
put
this
hypothetical
to
you.
the
carrier,
federal
express
or
whatever,
comes
on
a
package
which
by
reason
of
its
shape
and
its
weight
which
is...
and
its
lack
of
heavier
packaging
because
of
the
weight,
they
conclude
there's
something
dubious
about
it
because
it's
addressed
to
some
people
in
dublin,
ireland.
and
they
call
in
the
fbi,
and
they
run
it
through
an
x-ray,
and
they
see
that
it's
a
whole
bunch
of
automatic
pistols
or
machine
guns
or
whatever,
but
it
has
been
declared
something
else.
is
the
taking
of
that
x-ray
a
search
in
the
same
way
you
say
the
testing
of
the
powder
is
a
search?
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
incoming;
this
is
outgoing.
it
hasn't
left
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
yet.
unknown
speaker
but
dog
sniffing
is
no
intrusion.
the
dog
is
smelling
what
comes
out
of
the
package.
unknown
speaker
mr.
peterson,
may
i
interrupt
you?
if
you
emphasize
that
the
slitting
open
the
plastic
bag
and
taking
the
trace
out
to
test
it
is
a
search
rather
than
a
seizure,
would
your
case
be
precisely
the
same
if
the
bag
had
had
a
tiny
rip
in
it
at
the
time
this
all
happened?
unknown
speaker
just
took
a
little
bit
out
of
what
was...
which
they
could
get
to
without
having
to...
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
ripping...
on
the
puncturing?
i
think
you
do
not,
as
i
understand
you.
