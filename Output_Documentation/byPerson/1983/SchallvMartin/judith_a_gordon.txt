ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
presented
is
whether
a
new
york
state
family
court
judge
violates
the
due
process
clause
when
he
detains
an
accused
juvenile
delinquent
after
he
has
conducted
a
detention
hearing
and
after
he
has
found,
based
on
facts
and
reasons
elicited
at
that
hearing
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
that
the
juvenile,
if
released,
will
commit
a
pre-trial
crime.
when
the
judge
acts
in
this
premise,
he
relies
on
specific
statutory
authority,
namely,
section
320.5(3)(b)
of
new
york's
family
court
act,
which
is
the
statute
involved
in
this
appeal.
the
appeal
is
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
it
arises
in
the
proceedings
brought
by
detained
juveniles
for
a
class
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
i
will
address
section
320.5(3)(b)
and
related
provisions
of
article
3
initially
and
i
do
so
both
to
inform
the
court
about
the
procedural
constraints
that
new
york
imposes
on
the
judicial
decision
to
detain
an
accused
delinquent
prior
to
trial
and
to
rebut
at
the
same
time
several
alleged
deficiencies
in
this
procedures
which
were
assigned
to
it
in
the
opinions
below
and
are
noted
by
appellees.
i
will
then
turn
to
appellees'
two
principal
arguments
under
mathews
versus
eldridge,
namely,
that
some
crimes
must
be
excluded
from
section
320.5(3)(b)
and
that
some
guidelines
for
judicial
decision
making
must
be
added
so
that
the
statute
would
survive
scrutiny
under
the
due
process
clause--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--in
new
york,
your
honor?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
in
new
york...
new
york
provides
bail
for
adults
and
does
not
have
a
preventive
detention
statute.
it
has
been
noted,
however,
that
new
york's
bail
law
generally
does
take
at
least
some
account
of
future
crime
in
the
community
if
that
is
your
point.
of
course
your
honor
is
aware
that
the
district
of
columbia
itself
does
have
a
preventive
detention
statute
which
was
cert
denied
in
united
states
versus
edwards.
i
believe
it
was
the
term
before
last.
and,
we
suggest...
we
contend...
that
our
statute
is
identical
in
all
material
respects
to
edwards
and,
accordingly,
would
pass
muster
in
the
same
manner.
appellees
do
make
one
other
argument
other
than
their
mathews
argument
and
that
is
that
pre-trial
detention
to
prevent
crime
as
distinguished
from
pre-trial
detention
to
assure
appearance
at
trial
is
constitutional
punishment
and
we
have
addressed
that
argument
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
1
through
11.
turning
to
the--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--people
who
are
accused
of
a
crime
to
prevent
them
from
committing
a
crime?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
you
cannot
detain
somebody
that
has
not
been
accused
of
a
crime--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--we
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
there
are
two
separate
constitutional
limits.
one
is
quite
important
and
one
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
today
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
probable
cause.
that
is
not
quite...
well,
probable
cause
is
noted
by
appellees
in
the
course
of
their
discussion.
they
have
not
really
made
a
separate
fourth
amendment
challenge.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
think
that
probable
cause
in
the
sense
of
gerstein,
which
we
believe
is
met
under
this
statute,
and
in
the
sense
of
new
york's
further
requirement
that
there
be
an
adversarial
probable
cause
hearing
for
these
juvenile,
which
the
prosecution
has
the
burden,
that
that
probable
cause
requirement
is
well
met
in
this
case.
we
do
not
suggest
that
an
affirmative
finding
of
probable
cause
must
be
present
at
the
time
of
detention.
in
other
words,
it
is
sufficient
in
our
view
that
it
is
provided
and
the
child
be
given
an
opportunity
to
negative
it
at
the
time
of
detention
and
that
it
is
there
after
found
based
on
the
prosecutor's
burden.
in
other
words,
it
need
not
be
simultaneously
affirmatively
found.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely,
and
that
arises
from
the
existence
of
the
detention
or
perhaps
if
you
want
to
call
it
conversely,
the
release
statute
itself.
and,
that
statute
has
a
due
process
relation
in
the
same
sense
as
any
other
statute
that
creates
an
interest
in
property
or
liberty
would
have
a
due
process
relation.
and
the
appropriate
test
for
that
statute
is
the
mathews
versus
eldridge
test
and
it
involves
both
considerations
of
it
permissibility
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
appropriate
measure
of
the
process
that
is
due
which
is
exactly
the
issue
we
addressed
in
this
case,
the
principal
issue
we
addressed
in
this
case.
returning
to
the
statutory
scheme,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
we
know,
first
of
all,
who
the
person
is
or
who
the
child
is
that
is
involved.
and,
the
juvenile,
according
to
new
york
law
is...
the
juvenile
delinquent
under
new
york
law
is
an
individual
who
commits
an
act
between
the
ages
of
7
and
16
which,
if
done
by
an
adult,
would
be
a
crime.
under
section
302.2
of
the
family
court
act,
the
family
court's
jurisdiction
is
not
quite
so
confined.
a
juvenile
who
has
done
that
conduct
within
the
7
to
16
age
range
may
be
prosecuted
in
the
family
court
until
he
is
20
if
a
designated
felony
is
involved
or
until
he
is
18
if
another
felony
or
misdemeanor
is
involved.
a
designated
felony
is...
we
provide
a
list
of
them
for
you
at
page
6
of
our
brief
in
the
second
footnote.
it
is
essentially
a
list
of
crimes
allocated
by
age
which
permit
a
family
court
judge
sitting
at
disposition,
which
is
the
analog
of
sentencing,
to
give
an
initial
placement
period
of
three
to
five
years
which
is
somewhat
higher
than
the
12
to
18
month
initial
placement
period
that
is
available
for
other
crimes.
the
place
at
which...
the
proceeding
at
which
detention
may
be
considered
is
called
an
initial
appearance
and
if
a
child
has
been
detained
on
an
emergency
basis
by
an
admitting
detention
authority,
who
is
represented
here
today
by
the
new
york
city
department
of
juvenile
justice
which
is
administered
by
appellant,
if
he
has
been
admitted
to
such
an
agency
on
an
emergency
basis,
this
initial
appearance
where
detention
may
be
considered,
must
be
on
the
next
court
day
and
never
set
more
than
72
hours
later.
if
the
child
has
not
been
detained,
in
other
words
he
has
been
released
by
the
police
after
his
arrest,
his
initial
appearance
is
within
ten
days.
and,
i
call
your
attention
to
a
new
provision
of
the
statute,
noting
parenthetically
that
this
juvenile
delinquency
procedural
code
was
recently
amended
and
all
the
amendments
became
effective
last
july.
and,
there
are
some
differences
between
the
new
law
and
the
old
law
and
this
is
one
of
the
differences.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
probable
cause
standard
is
exactly
the
same,
your
honor.
there
is
one
difference,
however,
the
police,
on
releasing
the
child,
must
give
him
an
appearance
ticket
and
the
appearance
ticket
now
must
provide
that
in
a
designated
felony
he
must
return
to
court
within
72
hours
and
in
other
cases,
crimes
charged,
he
must
return
within
14
days.
this
makes
some
difference
in
looking
at
the
opinions
below
and
in
noting
appellees'
brief,
because
one
of
the
assignments
of
error
in
this
case
is
that
somehow
the
police
decision
to
release
a
child
rather
than
detain
him
or
bring
him
directly
to
the
court,
made,
according
to
the
district
judge
and
appellees,
the
judge's
decision,
who
was
sitting
in
that
court
later,
error
because
he
decided
to
detain
him
and
the
gap
in
time
between
the
time
the
child
was
originally
arrested
and
released
and
ultimately
appeared
in
court
and
when
detained
was'
pointed
out
as
an
inadequacy
in
the
statute,
although,
of
course,
it
relies
on
the
police
decision
and
not
on
the
judge's
decision.
in
any
event,
the
new
provision
of
the
law
now
restricts
the
time
limit
the
child
could
possibly
be
on
the
street
if
the
police
arrest
him.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely.
i
don't
know
whether
they
are
stronger,
your
honor.
i
think
they
are
different.
and,
essentially
they
are
as
follows:
let
us
assume
that
a
state
has
an
interest,
a
preventing
crime
interest,
which
is
universal.
it
applies
to
adults,
it
applies
to
juveniles.
the
state
has,
with
respect
to
that
juvenile,
another
interest
which
i
would
submit
to
you
it
does
not
have,
at
least
in
the
same
form
that
it
has
with
respect
to
the
juvenile,
and
that
is
child
protective
interest.
it
is
concern
that
a
child
at
the
formative
stages
of
his
life
not
be
engaged
in
a
series
of
criminal
acts,
lest
that
kind
of
anti-social
behavior
harm
him
normative
development.
and,
related
to
that,
that
he
should
not
be
engaged
in
those
criminal
acts
lest
he
actually
become
physically
harmed
by
them,
namely,
a
police
officer
shoots
him.
the
liquor
store
that
he
is
holding
up,
the
individual,
the
owner,
not
realizing
that
he
is
only
14,
thinking
he
is
18,
acts
immediately
and
harms
him.
new
york
has
those
interests
in
the
child.
in
that
sense,
it
has
its
parents'
patria
interest
which--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
keeping
the
child
harm
free,
and
while
it
may
have
some
interest
in
that
with
respect
to
adults,
it
has
a
stronger
interest
with
respect
to
the
child.
that
is
the
only
point.
in
addition,
your
honor,
we
would
also
say
that
the
child's
pre-trial
interest
in
liberty
is
not
the
same
as
an
adult.
the
essence
of
being
a
child,
of
being
an
unemancipated
minor
is
dependence
and
custodial
status.
obviously,
an
adult
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
to
freedom,
that
is
certainly
true,
but
he
certainly
has
a
higher
right
than
the
child.
so,
those
interests
in
relation
make
what
i
would
submit
to
you
is
a
match
in
favor
of
the
state
interest
in
preventive
detention,
pre-trial
preventive
detention
for
juveniles,
which
match
might
not
turn
out
to
be
the
same
if
one
carried
the
analog
to
the
adult,
to
adult
pre-trial--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--no,
your
honor,
not
quite.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
could
go,
right.
it
is
true
under
new
york
statute
any--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--well,
it
is
equally
true,
your
honor,
that
a
first
offender,
if
that
is
the
point,
who
comes
up
for
bail
may
be
denied
bail.
at
least
in
new
york
that
is
true.
denied
bail
is
a
discretionary
matter.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
a
first
offender
may
be
denied
bail--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--in
new
york
except
for--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--no.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
petty
larceny--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct.
whether--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--there
is
a
further
difference
which
i
think
follows
from
my
elaboration
to
the
chief
justice
and
that
is
new
york
has
a
stronger
interest,
i
think,
in
preventing
that
juvenile
from
committing
any
further
crime
than
it
perhaps
has
in
the
adult.
the
risk
to
the
juvenile
from
committing
that
crime
is
higher
than
the
adult
charged
with
petty
larceny.
and,
perhaps
more
importantly--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--do
you
mean--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--it
depends
a
lot,
as
our
detention
specialist
said,
and
indeed
the
detention
expert
for
the
city
of
the
trial
below,
it
depends
a
lot
on
the
home,
your
honor.
if
you
are
a
child
living
on
the
streets,
then
perhaps
any
home
is
better,
and
that
is
not
to
suggest
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
detention
facilities
that
we
have.
i
would
call
one
other
fact
to
your
attention,
your
honor.
when
i
say
that
a
juvenile
accused
of
petty
larceny
may
be
considered
for
detention,
i
say
that
advisedly,
because
in
the
juvenile
case
histories
that
are
presented
to
you
by
the
appellees,
there
is
at
least...
i
believe
at
least
two
petty
larcenists.
none
of
them
were
first
offenders,
your
honor.
they
had
records
of
seven,
six,
five
prior
contacts
with
the
family
court.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
who
was
detained?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
these
are
appellees'
exhibits.
they
were
petitioners'
below.
they--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--first
offenders
are
considered
for
detention.
for
any
detention,
there
must
be
facts
and
reasons
on
the
record
that
are
developed
at
this
hearing.
if
we
look
at
these
hearings,
at
least
so
far
as
we
have
them
in
the
record,
and
we
only
have
34,
we
find
not
merely
criminal...
the
commission
of
a
crime,
but
as
appellees'
witness
below,
the
psychiatric
witness
below,
dr.
zinn
testified,
a
pattern,
associated
characteristics...
in
other
words
we
find
a
child
who
is
charged
with
committing
a
crime
who
is
also
not
being
supervised
at
home,
who,
when
he
was
arrested,
lied
to
the
police,
who
is
a
truant
at
school.
in
other
words,
you
find
a
combination
of
associated
characteristics
which
are
called
a
delinquent
pattern.
now,
we
do
not
have
in
this
record,
and
so
far
as
we
know
from
the
information
that
we
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
have
a
single
petty
larcenist
detained.
that
is
all
we
can
say
because
the
data
is
not
assembled
any
other
way
and
appellees,
who
are
attempting
to
prove
their
point,
i
assume,
in
showing
us
that
there
were
minor
criminals
who
were
detained
who
did
not
have
records,
did
not
provide
us
with
that
information.
just
returning
briefly
to
the
statutory
scheme,
at
this
initial
appearance,
the
juvenile
has
all
due
process
rights
that
this
court
has
heretofore
elaborated.
he
is
for
a
preliminary
stage
of
a
proceedings
and
indeed
some
others.
he
is
present,
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent,
he
has
the
right
to
oppose
any
information
offered
against
him,
and
he
has
the
right
to
offer
information
on
his
own
behalf.
the
judge,
if
he
comes
to
the
detention
decision
at
all,
must
pass
through
two
release
options,
options
for
conditional
and
unconditional
release,
much
like
the
federal
bail
statute,
one
must
pass
through
some
unconditional
release
options,
much
like
the
district
of
columbia
preventive
detention
statute
where
the
judge
must
also
pass
through
some
release
options.
judge
quinones,
who
testified
below
for
the
state,
indicated,
i
think
quite
eloquently,
exactly
how
a
judge
comes
to
this
conclusion
and
that
is...
he
said,
and
this
a
point
of
the
application
of
the
statute,
chief
justice,
he
starts
with
absolutely
no
detention.
in
other
words,
he
starts
essentially
opposed
to
detention.
if
then
facts
and
circumstances
are
developed
at
this
hearing,
then
those
facts
and
circumstances
overcame
or
may
have
overcome
what
judge
quinones
called
the
strong
presumption
against
detention.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no.
there
are
no
additional
criteria,
as
appellees
call
them,
or
guidelines
for
decision
making
other
than
the
standard
itself
which
is
precise,
serious
risk
of
pre-trial
crime.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
decision
is
reviewable
by
several
routes,
generally
by
writ.
now,
appellees
say
that
this
really
is
a
non-reviewable
situation
omitting
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
appellate
law
with
respect
to
juvenile
delinquency
has
been
made
by
the
progress
of
these
writs
up
through
the
courts
and
that
new
york
takes
a
relaxed
or
quite
liberal
view
of
the
doctrine
of
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review,
and
renders
these
decisions.
indeed,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
which
upheld
this
very
statute
was
on
a
writ.
and,
they
omit
one
other
thing.
in
the
juvenile
case
histories
that
they
brought
to
bear
and
introduced
as
evidence,
one,
tony
gomez,
was
released
from
pre-trial
detention
by
the
writ
that
they
suggest
to
you
is
not
available.
so,
there
is
a
thorough
going
review.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
there
is
an
appeal
by
commission
to
the
appellate
division.
there
are
motions
for
reconsideration
and
i
believe--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--correct.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
reviewable.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
correct.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
that
is
exactly
what
appellees
are
saying.
they
are
saying,
well,
this
is
really
non-reviewable
because
the
issue
of
my
detention
become
moot,
not
necessarily
a
probable
cause
but
a
fact-finding
when
the
child
is
arguably
convicted,
which,
in
new
york
if
you
are
detained,
it
proceeds
very
quickly.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
but
the
probable
cause--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor,
but
as
i
was
indicating,
these
are
two
separate
notions,
one
the
fourth
amendment
notion,
and
the
other
the
detention
standard.
the
fact
that
there
was
probable
cause
found
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
detention
was
appropriate,
that
the
pre-trial
detention
was
appropriate.
but,
in
any
event,
even
if
it
were
so
construed,
new
york--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--certainly
that
is
true.
he
certainly
couldn't
stay
in
without
the
probable
cause
hearing,
but
an
affirmative
finding
of
probable
cause
doesn't
necessarily
cure
a
bad
detention.
but,
the
new
york
state
courts--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--yes,
it
does.
the
new
york
state
courts
have
not
viewed
the
detention
issue
as
moot,
thus
we
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
very
case
we
have
before
you.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
and,
often
a
fact-finding,
a
conviction.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
to
establish
the
appropriate
detention--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--pardon
me?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
exactly,
guidance
for
the
future
and
because
it
is
an
issue
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
the
child
in
people
ex
rel.
wayburn
versus
schupf
was
long
convicted
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
issue.
there
are
relatively
few
remaining
minutes
and
i
would
like
to
come
to...
i
think
we
have
at
least
touched
upon
the
first
mathews
argument
that
appellees
advance
which
goes
to
this
balancing
of
interest
that
i
was
elaborating
for
the
chief
justice
before.
we
believe
that
there
are
at
least...
in
addition
to
their
failure
recess
the
second
child
protective
interest
that
is
involved
in
the
statute,
and
their
failure
to
note
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
juvenile's
interest
in
pre-trial
liberty
and
an
adult's
interest
in
pre-trial
liberty.
when
appellees
press
this
analysis
they
get
to
a
third
error
which
is
perhaps
the
most
pervasive.
and,
that
is
since
they
hypothecate
that
some
group
of
crimes
must
be
excluded
from
this
prevention
detention
statute
and
they
characterize
them
as
trivial
crime,
but
they
never
define
what
kinds
of
crimes
they
mean.
their
weighing
of
the
state
interest
and
the
juvenile's
interest
in
these
crimes
that
are
to
be
excluded
is,
in
fact,
a
false
weighing.
in
other
words,
without
knowing
what
kinds
of
crimes
appellees
have
in
mind,
they
never
can
assess
the
importance
of
the
state's
interest
in
including
them
in
a
detention
standard,
nor
from
the
juvenile's
interest
in
pre-trial
liberty
in
excluding
them
from
the
standard.
so,
that
when
they
say
that
the
juvenile's
interest
outweighs
the
state's
interest,
they
really
have
not
made
the
requisite
comparison
or
the
one
that
mathews
requires.
in
addition,
the
suggestion
that
some
group
of
crimes
should
be
excluded
from
the
statute
turns
out
to
be,
on
the
testimony
of
their
own
witness,
the
criminologist
below,
to
yield
a
worse
statute
than
the
statute
that
is
now
on
the
books.
it
yields
a
worse
statute
because,
as
their
witness
testified,
the
more
you
qualify
crimes,
the
more
you
require
that
somebody
predict
a
specific
crime,
which
you
would
necessarily
have
to
do
to
exclude
crime,
the
worse
your
prediction
becomes.
in
other
words,
your
error
rate
increases
with
every
adjective
or
modification
and
with
every
particularization.
and,
indeed,
the
easiest
thing
to
predict
is
the
eventuation
of
crime
and
not
particular
crime.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
surely.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
well,
that
i
don't
find
a
problem
with.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
because
there
was
a
question
of
law.
it
is
a
question
of
law.
in
other
words,
they
did
not
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
law
was
administered
with
unfettered
discretion.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
right.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
was
about
to...
let
me
turn
to
that
argument
and
pick
up
with
you
and
justice
o'connor.
and
that
is
that
we
have
said,
said
at
the
outset
of
this
case
that
it
is
not
guidelines
for
the
decision
making
that
will
make
this
statute
constitutional.
it
is
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement
and
the
stenographic
record
which
is
the
requirement
that
takes
a
standard
and
translates
it
to
a
particular
case.
and,
that
is
the
standard
here.
in
other
words,
the
stenographic
record
and
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement.
we
said
that
kent
versus
the
united
states
established
that
proposition
and
we
adhere
to
it.
the
converse
proposition
that
appellees
are
arguing,
namely,
that
guidelines
for
decision
making,
as
opposed
to
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement,
somehow
are
the
thing
that
makes
the
statute
constitutional,
finds
no
warrant
in
the
law,
and
they
cite
us
to
no
case
which
says
that
guidelines,
whether
administrative
or
judicially...
quasi
judicially
created
in
a
legislative
capacity
of
a
judiciary
body,
are
what
make
the
law
constitutional.
there
is
no
case
like
that.
now,
i
think
if
we
follow
in
terms
of
logic
exactly
what
results
from
guidelines
as
opposed
to
from
facts
and
reasons
we
have
to
conclude
that
what
the
court
said
in
kent,
namely,
it
is
facts
and
reasons
and
not
guidelines,
that
that
is
the
appropriate
standard.
and,
i
point
out
the
following:
we
cited
in
our
opening
brief
the
prefatory
nature
of
guidelines
for
bail
decisions,
not
the
federal
bail
statute
and
the
new
york
bail
statute.
appellees
don't
challenge
us
on
that
at
all.
they
agree
apparently
that
these
are
prefatory.
what
is
prefatory,
your
honor,
seems
to
me
cannot
possibly
be
constitutionally
mandated.
second,
the
existence
of
guidelines
in
no
way
translates
itself
into
the
decision
making
process.
for
example,
if
i
were
to
take
the
seven
general
considerations
that
judge
quinones
testified
were
common
in
making
these
decisions
and
distribute
them
widely
to
every
judge...
every
family
court
judge
in
new
york
state,
i
would
nonetheless
be
unable
by
that
distribution
to
guarantee
that
any
judge
would
not
write
on
his
record,
to
use
the
classic
law
school
example,
the
boy
was
wearing
a
red
tie.
in
other
words,
the
guidelines
themselves
don't
make
the
judge
do
anything.
now,
certainly
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement
can
result
in
an
error
here
and
there,
but
certainly
that
requirement,
the
translation
of
the
standard
to
the
record,
is
what
protects
the
juvenile
from
unfettered
discretion.
indeed,
the
guidelines
allows
exactly
the
same
kind
of
subjective
decision
making
that
appellees
are
arguing
against
because
they
don't
won't
the
judge
to
do
anything.
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement,
in
contrast,
do.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
what
do
you
mean,
your
honor,
guidelines?
if
i
give
you--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--i
have
to
have
a
relatively
certain
standard.
ms.

standard
and

ms.

risk,
serious
risk
of
pre-trial
crime.
it
is
not
suggested...
at
least
appellees
bring
no
authority--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
is...
and
in
the
context,
you
must
understand,
a
post-arrest
context
where
the
conduct
is
regulable
in
and
of
itself.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
protection
of
the
child
certainly
is
a
guide.
it
is
the
state
interest
in
the
statute
and
it
does
obviously
guide
the
decision
making.
but,
for
example...
let
me
call
your
attention
to
one
example.
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
your
honor,
had
a
provision
in
it
that
said
defendants
accused
shall
be
admitted
to
bail.
that...
and
that
statute
was
constitutional,
your
honor,
and
that
didn't
have
any
more
guidelines
than
that.
now,
the
kent
statute--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--your
honor,
the
question
is
what
is--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
but
i
am
not--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--i...
to
go
to
mathews,
your
honor,
the
weighing
process
and
the
risk
of
error
analysis
that
mathews
requires,
the
risk
of
error
analysis...
i
think,
as
i
have
been
trying
to
point
out
to
you,
that
the
additional
of
guidelines
in
this
case,
just
like
the
addition
of
prefatory
guidelines
in
a
bail
statute,
no
more
make
that
risk
of
error
analysis
better
or
worse.
in
fact,
they
do
almost
nothing.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
don't
know
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
judge
quinones--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--that
judge
quinones
testified
that
there
were
common
considerations,
that
the
second
circuit
found
that
there
were
common
considerations,
and
that
appellees
now
concede
at
page
67
and
page
21
and
22
of
their
brief
that
there
are
common
considerations
that
are
used--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
--thank
you.
