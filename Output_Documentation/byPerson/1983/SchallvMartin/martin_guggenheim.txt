mr.
martin
guggenheim
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
in
an
important
one
which
permits
the
court
to
answer
the
question
left
open
in
re
gault,
whether
the
constitution
has
a
role
to
play
in
protecting
juveniles
from
inappropriate
depravation
of
liberty
before
their
trials.
to
ask
the
question
is
to
answer
it.
in
this
case
the
decision
to
detain
before
trial
is
an
important
one
in
any
criminal
justice
system,
but
it
is
especially
important
in
the
juvenile
system.
the
time
between
arraignment
and
trial
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
the
most
critical
time
in
the
trial
process.
detention
for
juveniles,
as
this
record
amply
supports,
is
even
worse
for
young
offenders.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
as
the
record
supports,
it
can
traumatize
them...
actually
i
used
the
wrong
phrase
when
i
said
offenders...
young
persons
accused
of
crime.
it
is
the
needless
detention.
if
they
didn't
need
to
be
detained
in
the
first
place,
it
is
worse
for
them
than
for
adults.
it
is
their
first
experience
very
often
away
from
their
home
and
loved
ones.
it
can
disrupt
their
school
setting
and
their
opportunity
for
advancement.
this
record
shows
it
has
done
that
to
prejudice
individuals.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
there
were
two
kinds
of
record,
two
parts
of
the
record
that
are
relevant.
one
are
the
34
case
histories.
of
them,
nine
juveniles
had
never
before
been
arrested
and
brought
before
the
court.
seventeen...
twenty-three
of
the
juveniles
had
never
had
any
prior
adjudication
whatsoever.
so,
there
is
a
powerful
record
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
applied
to
people
arrested
for
the
first
time.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
there
was
testimony
at
trial
by
hubert
benjamin,
a
probation
officer
of
30
years
experience,
who
testified
that
the
juvenile
will
be
interviewed
for
from
ten
to
forty-five
minutes
prior
to
the
initial
appearance.
and,
during
that
interview,
the
probation
officer
will
ask
the
juvenile
questions,
including
what
were
you
doing
at
the
time
you
were
arrested,
what
got
you
involved
in
this
offense.
and,
based
on
that
interview,
ten
to
forty-five
minutes,
make
a
recommendation
to
the
court
whether
to
parole
or
to
detain
the
juvenile
pre-trial.
it
has
been
applied
countless
times
to
juveniles
who
have
never
before
been
arrested,
to
juveniles
who
have
never
before
been
convicted,
and,
as
the
record
demonstrates,
to
juveniles
overwhelmingly
the
number
of
times
who
are
accused
of
only
minor
offenses.
and,
detention
along
with
adults--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--yes.
in
the
record
one
example
was
a
juvenile
who
was
playing
a
game
called
"three
card
monte",
a
gambling
game
in
violation
of
the
new
york
gambling
law.
he
was
detained
before
trial.
another
was
a
juvenile--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--gambling
law.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
a
misdemeanor.
the
record
also
shows
that
33
percent...
new
york,
of
course,
categorizes
by
felony
a
to
e
and
then
misdemeanor
a
and
b.
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
one
year
for
a's
and
b's
six
months.
thirty-three
percent
of
the
vera
justice
study
of
accused
juveniles
were
accused...
thirty-three
percent
of
those
brought
on
charges
of
the
misdemeanors
were
detained
before
trial.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
six
months.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
my
clients
is
the
whole
class.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
they
were
accused
of
more
serious
offenses,
but
they
were
only--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--one
was
armed
robbery.
one
was
attempted
murder.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
but,
of
course,
they
only
represent
the
class...
the
class,
as
the
briefs
clearly
show,
are
all
juveniles
in
the
state
who
were
eligible
for
detention
and
all
juveniles
in
the
state
who
were
accused
of
being
delinquent
are
eligible
for
detention.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
one
would
not
have
to
reach
out
to
them
to
what
end?
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
statute
is
constitutional.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
several
things,
but
before
i
give
an
answer,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
that
is
only
a
third
or
a
half
of
the
question
about
the
case,
because
the
case--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--the
broadest
issue
raised
before
this
court
is
whether
detaining
and
individual
accused
of
even
serious
offenses
before
he
or
she
has
had
a
day
in
court,
presumptively
innocent,
because
of
a
belief
that
the
individual
will
commit
more
crime
if
released,
thereby
assuming
the
individual
has
already
done
something
wrong,
violates
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
that
is
right.
the
second
circuit--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--it
is
before
this
court,
in
answer
to
your
question,
because
it
is
an
issue
in
the
case
which
goes
to
this
point.
even
if
this
statute
contained
the
kind
of
standards
and
criteria
which
might
permit
a
court
to
detain
an
individual
before
trial,
comporting
with
the
due
process
clause
in
the
mathews
and
eldridge
test,
the
question
would
still
remain,
may
a
court
detain
an
individual
before
trial
or
is
that
punishment
before
trial?
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no.
with
all
respect,
my
client
is
the
"three
card
monte"
accused
as
much
as
to
the
same
extent
as--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--martin,
rosario--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--justice
o'connor
identified
charges
correctly,
but--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--they
are
not
my
only
clients.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no.
i
am
saying
that
we
have
proven
that
the
appellees
class
has
had
its
rights
violated
under
the
constitution.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
if
this
were
not
a
class
action,
the
question
would
be
could
mr.
martin
challenge
this
statute
because
arguably
it
could
be
invoked
or
permits
detention
for
crimes
that
he
hasn't
been
accused
of.
i
don't
believe
though
that
the
law
of
class
action
limits
the
court
in
any
way
to
that
inquiry.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
i
think
that
once
a
class--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--that
may
be
right,
justice
white.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
my
point
is
that
the
inquiry
as
applied
includes
the
as
applied
in
this
record.
it
would
be
moot
for
this
court
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
was
applied
fairly
to
martin--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--who
is
already
over
16.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
but,
both
were
detained
under
the
same
statute,
so
i--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--would
now
answer--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--and,
that
is
exactly
the
action.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
this
isn't
an
overbreadth
attack
in
the
way
that
it
is
in
the
classic
first
amendment
case.
this
is
an
attack
on
a
statute
which
says
that
the
depriving
individuals
of
liberty
in
the
absence
of
any
standard,
not
because
of
absence
of
notice
to
the
accused,
but
because
the
statute
has
been
and
can
be
applied
inappropriately
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
can
finally
answer
the
question
justice
rehnquist
put
to
me
by
saying
that
even
the
named
plaintiffs
have
a
proper
attack
on
this
statute
by
arguing
that
the
absence
of
standards
in
this
scheme
render
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
them.
but,
this
is
not
an
as
applied
case.
this
record
was
an
attempt
to
show,
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
agreed,
although
finding
it
constitutional,
that
this
statute
contains
no
criteria
that
would
require
a
court
to
make
a
finding
one
way
or
another.
it
is
up
to
the
court's
unfettered
discretion
each
and
every
time.
that
is
true
for
martin.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
this
statute
contains
no
precisely
drawn
standards.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
okay.
that
leads
to
another
infirmity
in
this
statute.
its
very
existence
permits
the
depravation
of
liberty
without
meaningful
review.
martin
couldn't
obtain.
the
"three
card
monte"
offender
couldn't
obtain
it.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
if
that
is
the
court's
view,
the
case
is
moot.
martin
has
been
convicted,
he
is
no
longer
under
16,
the
statute
is
no
way
capable
of
repetition
as
to
him.
the
very
nature
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
an
on-going
problem.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no.
adjudicated,
sentenced,
sentence
fully
served,
and
he
is
now
19
years
of
age
and
his
particular
facts,
i
respectfully
submit,
are
not
dispositive
in
any
way
respecting
the
broad
reach
of
this
statute
or
its
unconstitutionality.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
but,
they
are
part
of
the
record
in
every
sense.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
this
statute
is
a
textbook
example
of
a
statute
without
standards.
any
juvenile
is
eligible
for
detention.
the
record
shows
that
most
juveniles
detained
not
only
were
accused
of
minor
offenses--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--the--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--the
question
of
bail
is
a
very
different
one.
with
respect
to
the
standards,
there
is
an
overlap,
but
with
respect
to
the
basis
for
detention,
what
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
infirmity
of
this
scheme
is
that
the
prediction
or
the
reason
for
the
detention
is
not
that
someone
won't
return
to
court,
which
is
the
bail
basis,
but
that
someone
will
commit
a
crime
if
released.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
court
has
to
find
or
presume
in
order
to
detain.
we
claim
that
this
statute
has
no
standards
in
several
respects,
but
among
them
is
that
the
court
is
not
limited
in
a
finding
of
substantial
probability
that
the
individual
committed
the
offense
of
which
he
or
she
is
accused,
no
finding
of
probable
cause,
no
finding
of
probable
conviction
or
sentence.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
not
with
bail
but
with
preventive
detention.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
as
this
court
said
in
kent
against
the
united
states,
that
a
court
of
justice
dealing
with
adults
with
respect
to
a
similar
issue
would
proceed
in
this
manner.
there
is
no
such
state--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no.
i
am
simply
making
the
point
of
the
language
of
the
opinion.
it
was
inconceivable
to
this
court
that
the
district
of
columbia
would
deal
with
adults,
that
any
state
would
the
way
they
dealt
with
juveniles.
that
is
the
argument
here.
inconceivable
that
a
state
would
deprive
an
individual
of
liberty
on
the
unfettered,
open-ended
discretion
that
it
can
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
i
do,
but
to
contrast
that--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
know
of
one
in
this
district,
for
example.
and,
in
hunt
against
roth,
although
the
court
struggled
with
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
proof
is
evident
and
presumption
great,
in
both
schemes
the
legislature
required
as
a
sine
qua
non
that
there
be
a
finding
that
the
individual
probably
committed
the
crime,
a
substantial
likelihood,
that
it
be
limited
to
very
serious
offenders.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
would
for
this
reason.
the
mathews
and
eldridge
test--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--but,
only
in
this
sense.
it
is
a
flexible
test.
what
is
due
process?
the
question
is
is
the
mere
finding
of
probable
cause
enough?
i
would
be
here
saying
no.
add
to
that,
limited
to
the
martin
fact
pattern,
accused
of
attempted
murder,
limited
to
a
showing
of
substantial
probability
of
ultimate
placement,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
the
ultimate
fact
that
the
person
is
likely
to
have
committed
a
crime,
raise
the
standard
of
proof.
add
them
together
and
i
think
mathews
is
met
and
detention
is
not
arbitrary
assuming
the
second
argument
would
be
reached
adversely
to
our
case
which
is
that
detention
before
trial
itself
is
punishment
for
that
purpose.
i
clearly
put
that
argument
aside
to
say
i
would
be
here
if
the
only
thing
new
york
did
was
add
probable
cause.
but,
new
york
not
only
doesn't
have
probable
cause,
it
has
no
standard
of
proof.
it
is
applied
to
everybody.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes,
but
the
limit
of
detention
in
no
way
mitigates
the
massive
curtailment
of
liberty
that
this
court
finds
to
be
at
the
heart
of
the
due
process
clause.
it
interferes
with
preparation
for
trial,
it
increases
the
probability
of
conviction,
it
increase
the
probability
of
ultimate
placement.
the
record
demonstrates
all
of
those
things
overwhelmingly
and
in
an
undisputed
way.
so,
the
mere
17-day
detention
is
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
in
its
effect
adverse
to
the
person's
liberty
interest.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
am
using
the
word
not
in
its
technical
sense.
adjudication
and
placement.
there
is
no
possibility
of
conviction.
one
of
the
other
irrational
aspects
of
this
case...
and
i
could
answer
this
in
another
way,
justice
rehnquist,
to
the
martin
and
rosario
fact
pattern,
although
i
frankly
think
the
case
is
much
broader
than
that...
that
juveniles
accused
of
the
most
serious
offenses
from
13
to
16
are
prosecuted
in
new
york
as
juvenile
offenders
in
the
adult
court.
for
them
preventive
detention
may
not
be
applied.
similarly,
juveniles...
persons
16
to
18,
which
in
most
states
are
juveniles,
but
not
in
new
york,
are
not
eligible
for
preventive
detention.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
cannot
explain
the
irrationality
of
the
scheme
i
have
just
described.
but,
the
record
is
plain,
from
judge
quinones
to
every
piece
of
datum
in
this
record,
that
the
purpose
of
this
detention
is
singular.
it
is
to
protect
the
community
from
crime
in
the
interim.
that
is
its
only
purpose
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
now,
one
of
our
claims
in
this
case
is
that
it
is
punishment
before
trial
and
i
would
very
briefly
like
to
explain
that
argument.
this
constitutes
an
affirmative
restraint
imposed
by
the
state
for
a
purpose
historically
regarded
as
punishment,
incapacitation.
in
united
states
against
brown
and
kennedy
against
mendoza-martinez
this
court
has
plainly
held
that.
this
comes
into
play
only
because
the
individual
is
accused
of
wrongdoing
and
it
is
applied
to
behavior
which
is
already
a
crime.
the
state
may
not
detain
individuals
before
trial
because
of
a
belief
that
they
will
commit
a
crime
in
the
interim
before
their
conviction.
but,
if
they
may,
it
is
plain
that
any
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
incarceration
follow
rather
than
precede
adjudications
of
guilt
can
be
justified,
if
at
all,
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
there
is
none
in
this
case.
the
only
and
lame
justification
for
the
scheme
presented
by
the
state
is
that
the
facts
and
reasons
requirement
of
this
statute
make
up
for
all
of
the
absences
of
procedural
due
process
protections.
that
requirement
of
facts
and
reasons
was
put
into
this
statute
by
the
legislature,
as
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
at
page
36
points
out,
solely
so
that
the
legislature
could
see
how
the
statute
was
operating.
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
no
meaningful
opportunity
to
review
the
detention
decision
made
by
the
judge
even
with
the
facts
and
reasons.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
habeas
is
available
as
a
theoretical
remedy,
but
when
a
judge
has
before
him
or
her
a
case
in
which
the
other
side,
the
state,
says,
your
honor,
the
statute
says
that
the
court
may
detain
when
it
finds
a
serious
risk
and
it
has
found
so
in
this
case
and
stated
its
reasons
and
facts
on
the
record,
that
ends
the
inquiry.
not
a
single
case
has
been
uncovered
by
the
state
or
by
the
appellees
to
show
release
of
a
juvenile
for
violation
of
the
statute
of
detention
when
the
facts
and
reasons
were
given
on
the
record.
i
have
litigated
countless
habeas
corpus
cases,
a
decision
in
the
record,
but
one
does
not
win
unless
the
violation
was
that
the
court
said
go
to
jail
without--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--no,
he
is
a
juvenile
court
judge.
he
is
sometimes
what
they
call
a
three
hatter
and
sits
as
judge
of
three
courts.
but,
when
he
is
sitting
a
juvenile
court
judge,
that
is
his
role.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
i
don't
know--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
doubt
that,
but
i
frankly
don't
know.
but,
certainly
in
new
york
different
judges
sit,
but
the
point
is
it
is
an
illusory...
and,
as
the
legislature
said,
we
want
to
see
a
review
of
the
scheme,
but
it
doesn't
meaningfully
protect.
justice
white
is
quite
right,
as
the
process
moves
along,
the
individuals
in
detentions,
that
is
the
way
it
works.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
we
believe
as
a
basic
point
that
if
this
court
does
not
find
that
this
statute
violates
due
process
of
law,
it
almost
certainly
does
not
violate
equal
protection
of
the
law.
we
have
abandoned
that
claim
at
this
time.
we
think
that
the
heart
of
our
case
is
that
this
statute
cannot
withstand
scrutiny.
we
think
as
a
bottom-line
point
detention
before
trial
for
the
purposes
envisioned
by
this
statute
offend
for
other
reasons
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
the
court
to
decide
this
case
to
reach
that
other
issue.
but,
if
it
is
to
reach
that
other
issue,
we
submit
that
this
is
a
classic
example
of
utilizing
the
statute
in
the
wrong
way.
most
of
the
juveniles
who
are
detained
are
ultimately
released
home.
the
vast
bulk
are
released
home
and
half
are
never
even
convicted.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
frankly,
your
honor,
it
is
the
only
way
to
approach
this
problem.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
there
is
no
article
3
case
or
controversy.
i
have
litigated
this
case
in
different
manner
since
1973
in
the
state
courts.
now,
when
you
come
into
the
federal
court
to
challenge
this,
if
you
don't
have
a
class
action,
your
clients
group
up
and
they
grow
out
of
the
age...
this
isn't
even
a
hunt
v.
roth
case
where
you
can
say,
well,
when
you
are
released
from
prison,
you
may
ultimately
be
rearrested
assuming
you
don't
get
life.
here,
when
they
are
16,
they
are
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
it
is
incapable
of
repetition.
it
is
only
by
the
device
of
class
action
that
we
can
litigate
it.
and,
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff
is
relevant
only
to
the
inquiry,
i
submit,
of
whether
a
class
action
is
properly
certified.
once
it
is
properly
certified,
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
all
juveniles
eligible
for
detention,
then
the
"three
card
monte"
detainee
is
as
important
an
example
as
the
martin
example.
we
have
evidence
in
this
record
that
judges
base
their
decision
to
detain
on
the
political
climate
of
the
situation,
of
how
much
media
attention
a
case
gets.
one
judge's
policy,
perfectly
lawful
under
this
statute,
reviewable
by
writ
or
otherwise,
to
detain
all
juveniles
who
are
accused
of
an
offense
in
which
a
gun
was
involved.
that
is
in
the
record.
now,
that
may
be
lawful
with
a
statute
which
has
a
showing
of
a
standard
of
proof
and
a
probable
cause
and
likelihood
of
conviction
and
other
protections.
this
statute
lacks
all
of
the
essential
protections
which
the
constitution
requires
in
the
due
process
clause.
what
is
nice
about
this
case,
if
i
may,
is
that
affirmance
is
going
to
improve
a
system
of
justice
which
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
condemned
for
its
failure
to
live
up
to
its
ultimate
promise.
what
is
wrong
with
juvenile
justice
in
part,
this
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions,
is
that
it
fails
to
deter
and
it
often
fails
to
rehabilitate.
every
major
study
of
juvenile
justice
shows
in
full
conformity
with
this
record
that
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
are
punished,
if
at
all,
before
their
trial.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
yes.
new
york,
in
its
wisdom,
has
not
imposed
such
a
requirement
and
we
think
frankly
that
that
is
sensible
in
many
ways
because
there
are
laws
that--
mr.
martin
guggenheim
--i
think
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
martin
guggenheim
well,
now
you
are
asking
me
the
same
question
as
before.
is
that
standard
itself
constitutional?
mr.
martin
guggenheim
no,
i
am
not
making
that
argument.
i
am
saying
that
this
court
can
comfortably
affirm
in
the
knowledge
that
it
will
result
in
fewer
juveniles
being
punished
before
their
trial,
but
not
in
fewer
juveniles
being
detained
when
there
is
a
need
to
bring
them
to
court
for
their
trial
when
there
is
a
risk
of
flight
because
they
are
eligilbe
for
detention
under
a
statute
not
being
charged.
since
1981,
in
june,
this
statute
has
been
enjoined
in
new
york.
it
hasn't
been
operating,
and
yet
arrest
statistics
show
that
the
arrest
rate
is
down.
there
is
not
compelling
state
reason
to
justify
this
statute.
there
is
a
strong
policy
reason
to
overrule
this
statute
so
that
juveniles
will
be
detained
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
after
they
have
been
proven
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
not
before.
if
there
are
no
further
question--
