unknown
speaker
what
are
the
conditions
on
which
an
adult
offender,
given
all
the
same
factors,
could
be
detained
before
a
trial?
unknown
speaker
yes,
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
what
constitutional
limits
are
there
on
a
state's
authority
to
detain
people
who
are
not
accused
of
any
crime
to
prevent
them
from
committing
future
crimes?
unknown
speaker
who
are
not.
can
you
detain
somebody
if
they
are
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and,
if
they
have
been
accused
of
a
crime,
what
constitutional
limits
are
there
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
a
requirement,
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
constitutional
limitations?
unknown
speaker
is
the
probable
cause
standard
the
same?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
are
stronger
reasons
to
apply
this
restraint
on
juveniles
than
on
adults?
unknown
speaker
you
are
suggesting
that
liquor
store
owners
shoot
people,
i
think,
who
are
18
but
not
14?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but,
the
trouble
is
if
you
have
got
a
hardened
criminal,
you
can
deny
him
bail.
but,
the
infant
doesn't
get
any
benefit.
he
can
be
the
most
decent
child
and
committed
one
mistake
and
he
goes.
unknown
speaker
i
said
he
could
go.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
that
difference?
why
not
give
the
child
a
chance,
the
same
chance
you
give
a
grown
person?
unknown
speaker
a
first
offender
can
be
denied
bail?
unknown
speaker
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
for
petty
larceny?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but,
an
infant
can
be
held
in
jail
for
petty
larceny,
first
offense.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
difference,
isn't
there?
why
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
on
that
one
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
that
a
juvenile
in
the
average
juvenile
home
is
better
off
on
not
committing
another
crime
and
not
learning
how
to
commit
another
crime?
unknown
speaker
the
average
juvenile
home
is
not
as
conducive
to
good
living
as
a
home
is,
the
average
home.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
assume
that
in
the
city
of
new
york
you
have
found
at
least
one
first
offender
juvenile.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
any?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
there
are
no...
how
do
you
get
the
second
offenders
up
there
if
you
don't
have
any
first
ones?
[laughter]
are
you
able
to
shed
any
light...
what
is
the
practice
if
you
know
with
respect
to
first
offenders?
are
they
detained
for
shoplifting?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
there
are
no
statutory
requirements
in
that
require
under
the
new
york
scheme,
is
that
right,
for
what
the
judge
has
to
consider?
unknown
speaker
what
review
is
there
of
the
family
court
decision
to
detain
a
juvenile?
unknown
speaker
does
the
new
york...
go
ahead.
i
just
wanted
to
know,
you
said
there
were
several
mechanisms.
what
are
the
others?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
probable
cause
hearing?
won't
that
occur
before
anything
else
could
happen
and
it
has
to
happen
within
six
days,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
reviewable.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
always
be...
if
probable
cause
isn't
found,
there
is
a
release,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
so,
really
what
is
going
to
be
reviewed
in
all
these
proceedings
by
a
writ
is
the
finding
of
probable
cause,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
i
would
think
by
then
the
probable
cause...
by
the
time
you
can
get
a
writ,
the
probable
cause
hearing
will
go
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
by
the
time
you
could
get
a
writ
wouldn't
the
probable
cause
hearing
have
been
held?
unknown
speaker
and,
then
there
would
have
been
a
release
if
there
isn't
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
but,
it
would
mean
that
it
couldn't
happen
without
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
but,
it
helps.
unknown
speaker
right.
but,
when
they
review
it,
at
least
for
all
practical
purposes,
there
already
has
been
a
finding
of
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
yes.
do
you
mean
they
will
still
review
if
there
has
been
a
conviction?
unknown
speaker
for
what
purpose?
unknown
speaker
just
for
the
guidance
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
because
of
the
guidance
for
the
future?
unknown
speaker
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
this
question?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
do
about
the
fact
that
both
courts
below
found
as
a
fact
that
the
law
was
carried
out
with
unfettered
discretion
by
the
family
court
judges
and
they
decided
against
you
on
due
process
grounds?
unknown
speaker
you
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
they...
if
i
may
interrupt
you
again,
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
concluded
that
whatever
might
be
said
under
gerstein
against
pugh
which
was
a
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
case--
unknown
speaker
--that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
were
no
standards
so
that
the
family
court
judges,
in
their
own
unfettered
discretion,
determined
when
to
detain
these
young
people.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
measure
due
process
without
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you...
any
kind
of
guidelines,
written,
oral.
don't
you
have
to
have
guidelines
to
have
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
have
to
have
a
standard?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
is
that
all?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
is
protection
of
the
child
a
guide?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
me
to
give
you
some
cases
where
this
court
said
in
due
process
you
do
have
to
have
guidelines?
do
you
need
those?
unknown
speaker
you
don't,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
other
case
that
the
answer
to
the
lack
of
due
process
is
answered
by
you
don't
need
any
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
does
it
help?
unknown
speaker
i
give
up.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
worse
for
young
offenders?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
how
many
first
offenders
or
at
least
persons
brought
for
the
first
time
before
the
juvenile
court
are
detained
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
report
in
the
nature
of
probation
report
presented
before
the
decision
is
made?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
minor
offenses,
mr.
guggenheim,
can
you
give
us
some
example
of
what
specifically
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
character
of
the
new
york
offense
which
he
violated?
unknown
speaker
what,
a
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
upper
limit
of
the
punishment
of
an
adult
on
a
b
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
six
months.
and,
your
clients
were
detained
for
what
crimes?
unknown
speaker
the
named
class
representatives.
unknown
speaker
armed
robbery
and
what
else?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
one
wouldn't
have
to
reach
out
to
the
unnamed
class
member,
the
"three
card
monte"
defendant,
to
adjudicate
the
cases
of
your
clients,
would
they,
an
armed
robber
potentially
and
an
attempted
murder?
unknown
speaker
but,
underlying
the
presentation
of
your
case
to
the
second
circuit,
i
gather,
was
the
assumption
that
there
couldn't
be
any
sort
of
an
individualized
consideration
or
whether
this
statute
as
applied
to
certain
people
might
be
constitutional
and
unconstitutional
as
to
others.
what
is
unconstitutional
about
applying
this
statute
to
the
particular
named
people
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
we
try
it
with
that
third
or
that
half?
unknown
speaker
the
second
circuit
didn't
answer
that
question.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
is
it
before
this
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying
then
that
because
the
standards
may
be
unsuitable
or
perhaps
unconstitutional
for
a
"three
card
monte"
defendant,
your
clients
were
armed
robbers
and
attempted
murders
can't
be
detained
under
it
because
of
some
overbreadth
concept?
unknown
speaker
who
are
the
named
parties
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they
charged
with?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
saying
that
the
named
parties
can't
be
held
under
this
statute
because
it
is
unconstitutional
as
to
a
"three
card
monte"
defendant.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
what
rights
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
prevent
us
from
addressing
the
question
of
the
standing
of
the
named
plaintiffs
to
represent
the
rest
of
the
class
and
to
at
least
determine...
i
would
think
you
at
least
start
out
with
the
status
of
the
named
members
of
the
class.
the
class
action
may
be
a
good
deal
broader,
but
certainly
you
don't
ignore
the
status
of
the
named
members
of
the
class.
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
the
question
to
you
another
way.
your
suggestion,
it
sounds
to
me,
is
that
because
a
class
has
been
certified,
the
court
must
adjudicate
the
statute
on
its
face
rather
than
as
applied
to
a,
b,
c,
or
d.
i
would
think
the
class
action
certification
wouldn't
prevent
the
court
from
saying,
well,
this
statute
is
perfectly
all
right
as
applied
to
the
named
plaintiffs.
it
is
unconstitutional
as
to
this
lawyer's
other
clients.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
might--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
might
come
out
with
completely
different
answers
as
to
how...
as
to
its
constitutionality
as
applied
to
the
named
plaintiffs
and
as
applied
to
the
"three
card
monte"
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
oh,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
we
don't
have
an
overbreadth
doctrine
for
criminal
procedural
statute.
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
facial
attacks,
involve
only
first
amendment
situations.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
argument
goes
just
as
well
to
your
clients
as
to
the
other
members
of
the
class.
i
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but,
apart
from
adjudicating
the
case
of
martin,
the
court
may
not
be
required
to
make
a
finding,
but
it
makes
perfectly
sensible
findings
that
he
is
apt
to
commit
another
crime.
now,
the
statute
may
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
somebody
else
with
respect
to
whom
different
findings
have
been
made.
what
is
unconstitutional
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what?
what
case
says
you
have
to
have
precisely
drawn
standards
when
you
can
examine
the
way
a
statute
is
administered
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
unknown
speaker
well,
martin
is
getting
it
right
now.
unknown
speaker
you
used
the
word
"convicted".
has
he
been
convicted
as
an
adult
or
as--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
suggest
to
you
you
may
not
want
an
adjudication.
if
all
you
want
is
an
adjudication
on
space
and
we
find
that
in
some
circumstances
this
statute
is
perfectly
constitutionally
applied,
you
lose
your
entire
case.
it
just
isn't
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
then
i
would
think
you
would
want
us
to
say,
well,
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
other
people
in
your
class,
other
members
of
your
class.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
part
of
your
argument
certainly
goes
to
a
facial
challenge
even
with
respect
to
the
named
plaintiffs
and
everybody
else
like
them.
i
understand
that.
but,
we
may
not
agree
with
you
on
that.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
state...
what
if
the
federal
government
or
the
state,
in
order
to
implement
its
constitutional
requirements
of
bail,
says
unreasonable
bail
shall
not
be
required?
now,
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
that?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
you
just
adjudicate
individual
cases
under
that
standard.
no
standards
other
than
reasonableness.
unknown
speaker
with
your
argument
i
would
take
it
would
go
to
adults
as
well
as
juveniles,
to
the
same
statute,
the
same
vagueness.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
kent
wasn't
a
constitutional
case,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
don't
know
of
any
jurisdictions
around
that
are
considering
prevention
statutes
for
adults?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
you
do?
you
do
know
some?
unknown
speaker
well,
wouldn't
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
the
judge
or
the
officer
in
the
first
instance
before
he
had
to
make
a
finding
of
probable
cause?
that
is
a
great
standard
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
be
here
making
exactly
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is,
yes,
you
would
be
making
the
argument.
unknown
speaker
but,
very
quickly
it
has
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
there
is
no
possibility
of
conviction
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
first
example
may
simply
vindicate
your
opponent's
view
that
new
york
regards
its
parents'
patria
role
with
the
children
as
being
involved
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
detention.
unknown
speaker
how
about
habeas?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
in
the
counties
outside
of
new
york
where
the
judge
is
not
a
juvenile
court
judge,
he
is
a
regular
judge?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
judge
that
is
going
to
get
a
writ
of
habeas?
unknown
speaker
against
himself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
guggenheim,
you
made
an
equal
protection
claim
below
as
well.
oh,
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
also
that
a
class
action
was
not
the
appropriate
way
to
approach
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
not
a
case
by
case?
unknown
speaker
could
bail
be
required,
reasonable
bail
be
required?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
my
question
is
would
it
be
constitutional
to
require
bail
before
there
is
release?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
bail?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
making
an
argument
that...
bordering
on
an
argument
that
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
detain
juveniles
at
all.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
