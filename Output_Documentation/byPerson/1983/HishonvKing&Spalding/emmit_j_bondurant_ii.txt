mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
next
summer
we
will
observe
the
20th
anniversary
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
it
is
ironic
that
after
almost
19
years
of
the
existence
of
that
act
we
are
before
this
court
to
discuss
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
act
applies
to
sex
discrimination
in
the
private
practice
of
law
in
the
most
highly
compensated,
and
outside
the
judiciary,
the
most
prestigious
positions
of
the
legal
profession.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes.
i
think
i
said
most
highly
compensated,
and
outside
of
the
judiciary,
most
prestigious,
your
honor.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
don't
think
the
court
was
misinformed
as
to
the
intent.
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
held
that
because
the
respondent
was
organized
as
a
commonlaw
partnership,
acts
of
discrimination,
which
the
complaint
alleges,
were
practiced
by
that
firm
in
the
selection
of
partners
were
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act.
thus,
even
though
the
complaint
specifically
alleged,
and
the
lower
courts
accepted
it
as
true,
as,
of
course,
they
must
for
purposes
of
ruling
upon
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
the
firm
engaged,
pursuant
to
a
100-year
pattern
and
practice,
of
discrimination
against
women
in
the
selection
of
partners.
the
lower
courts
nevertheless
ruled
that
that
discrimination
was
outside
the
coverage
of
title
vii
and
that
title
vii
afforded
the
petitioner
no
remedy
for
that
discrimination.
an
analysis
of
this
case
must
begin,
of
course,
with
the
statutory
language
of
the
act.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
king
&
spalding
is
not
an
employer
or
a
person
covered
by
the
act.
that
is
undisputed.
it
is
plainly
a
firm
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
in
the
course
of
interstate
commerce
with
15
or
more
employees
and
with
offices
in
two
cities.
nor
is
there
is
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
ms.
hishon,
an
associate
for
almost
eight
years
with
the
firm,
was
an
employee
of
the
firm.
she
plainly
was
an
employee
as
an
associate.
the
question
in
this
case
rather
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
acts
of
sex
discrimination
which
the
complaint
alleges
were
practiced
by
king
&
spalding,
admittedly
an
employer,
against
ms.
hishon,
admittedly
an
employee
covered
by
the
act,
were
themselves
unlawful
employment
practices
covered
by
section
703
of
the
act.
we
believe
that
the
answers
to
these
questions
are
in
the
affirmative.
first,
let
me
point
out
by
stating
that
the
petitioner
agrees
with
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
that
it
is
really
not
essential
in
this
case
to
reach
of
the
broader
question
of
whether
or
not
the
partnership
relationship;
that
is
the
relationship
between
an
individual
partner
and
the
institution
itself
is
an
employment
relationship.
for
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
in
the
brief,
we
think
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question
is
indicated
in
this
and
other
cases.
however,
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
narrower
ground,
that
in
her
particular
position
as
an
associate
of
the
law
firm,
the
opportunity
to
be
considered
for
partnership
on
a
fair,
equal,
and
non-discriminatory
basis
was
both
a
term,
condition,
and
privilege
of
her
employment
and
employment
opportunity,
both
of
which
were
explicitly
within
the
protection
of
section
703
of
the
act
and
were,
when
the
firm
practiced
sexual
discrimination
in
making
those
decisions,
were
unlawful
employment
practices
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
complaint
clearly
and
specifically
alleged
that
the
firm
held
out
and
represented
to
the
petitioner
and
to
all
other
associates
whom
it
sought
to
recruit,
the
opportunity
for
fair,
non-discriminatory
consideration
for
partnership
after
completion
of
five
or
six
years'
employment
with
the
firm
and
hard
and
satisfactory
work
during
that
period.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
no,
your
honor,
they
all
did
not
become
partners.
but,
the
firm
held
out
to
the
petitioner
and
to
other
associates
the
opportunity
to
be
so
considered
and
by
holding
out
that
opportunity
the
terms,
conditions,
and
privileges
of
her
employment
included
the
opportunity
for
fair,
non-discriminatory
consideration
for
partnership.
when
that
was
denied
her,
and
that
is
what
the
complaint
alleges,
that
she
was
not
given
fair,
non-discriminatory
consideration
for
partnership,
the
firm
committed
an
unlawful
employment
practice
covered
by
section
703,
which
is--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
that
is
correct.
and,
the
process
of
selection--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--certainly
from
among
associates,
that
is
true.
we
also
believe
that
that
is
true
if
one
were
considering
partners
from
the
outside,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
express
representations
of
non-discriminatory
consideration
were
made
and
it
is
the
opportunity
for
advancement
which
every
associate
possesses
in
his
or
her
capacity
as
an
employee
of
the
firm
which
is
and
becomes
both
an
employment
opportunity
and
a
term,
condition,
or
privilege
of
employment.
it
does
not
make
a
difference
that
the
position
of
partnership
is
or
is
not
itself
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
for
in
the
labor
cases,
this
court
has
recognized,
as
have
the
lower
courts,
that
where
a
federal
statute
applies,
as
in
the
labor
cases,
and
is
violated,
it,
does
not
make
a
difference
that
the
opportunity
for
promotion
is
being
withheld
for
an
unlawful
reason
under
one
of
those
statutes,
even
though
the
the
position
to
which
the
employee
would
have
been
promoted
was
entirely
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act.
thus,
in
this
case,
the
complaint
specifically
alleged
that
she
possessed
in
her
position
as
an
employee
the
opportunity
to
be
considered
and
be
promoted
to
a
partner,
that
it
was
an
opportunity
for
advancement,
that
it
was
withheld
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and,
therefore,
is
plainly
within
the
literal
language
of
section
703
of
the
act.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
if
the
firm--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--i
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
think
the
firm
will
be
covered
by
section
703.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
am
not
sure
what
your
honor
means
by
that.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
it
is
imposed
by
the
operation
of
law,
it
is
reinforced,
whereas
in
this
instance,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
firm
explicitly
held
out
as
an
inducement
fair,
non-discriminatory
consideration
for
partnership
after
five
or
six
years
of
employment.
in
our
view,
it
would
not
make
a
difference
if
the
firm
had
been
silent;
that
is
if
the
firm's
business
practices
are
such
that
the
firm
regularly
reviews
its
associates
and
evaluates
them
for
promotion
to
partnership
and
does
so
on
a
basis
that
is
prohibited
by
title
vii,
that
would
violated
title
vii
even
if
the
firm
were
silent
in
terms
of
representations
it
makes
to
an
associate.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
it
plays
no
part
other
than
reinforcing
the
notion.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
well,
let
me
put
it
in
this
sense.
we
believe
that
if
the
firm
were
silent
that
it
would
nevertheless
be
covered
under
section
703.
that
is
that
the
opportunity
for
advancement
which
one
possesses
as
an
associate
adheres
in
the
relationship
and
that
where
a
firm
regularly
promotes
associates
to
partnership
from
that
relationship,
that
that
is
an
opportunity
of
the
employment
and
an
implicit
term,
condition,
privilege
of
employment
that
could
not
be
withheld
on
the
basis
of
sex.
that
case,
we
believe,
becomes
even
stronger,
where
to
induce
one
to
enter
into
the
relationship
in
the
first
instance,
the
firm
holds
out
the
opportunity
for
nondiscriminatory
consideration
for
employment
after
five
or
six
years.
if
you
were
employed
by
a
law
firm
and
the
law
firm
said
to
you,
we
make
no
representations
to
you
whatsoever
as
to
non-discriminatory
employment,
but
nevertheless,
the
practice
is
to
review
and
evaluate
associates
as
they
progress
and
to
select
from
among
those
associates
those
who
will
be
allowed
to
advance
in
the
partnership
and
the
remainder
to
be
terminated
by
the
firm,
we
believe
that
is
a
term,
condition,
and
privilege
of
employment.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
15
or
fewer
employee
limit
excludes
business
establishments
with
fewer
than
that
number
of
employees.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
no,
your
honor,
it
would
be
actionable,
if
at
all,
under
state
law,
because
title
vii
explicitly
excludes
coverage
from
employers
with
fewer
than
15
employees.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
let
me
answer
it
in
two
ways.
first,
that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
this
question
is
a
denial
of
the
admission
to
partnership
itself
and
whether
it
is
actionable
under
title
vii.
secondly,
under
the
broader
theory
which
we
advocate,
it
is
our
view
that
that
would
be
covered
by
title
vii.
the
question
under
title
vii
is
whether
or
not
the
relationship
between
a
lawyer
practicing
with
a
firm
and
the
firm
itself
is
an
entity,
is
an
employment
relationship;
that
is
does
it
have
the
principal
attributes
of
employment
as
a
matter
of
economic
reality,
it
is
not
a
formalistic
relationship,
and,
therefore,
if,
for
the
sake
of
a
hypothetical,
after
three
years
as
a
member
of
the
partnership
the
firm
should
simply
vote
to
reduce
a
female
or
black
partner's
earnings
to
zero
as
a
method
of
excluding
them
from
the
partnership,
having
being
compelled
to
admit
them
in
the
first
instance
under
an
order
of
the
court.
it
is
our
view
that
that
would
be
independently
actionable
under
title
vii.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
well,
not
quite
any
partner.
the
partner
must
first
be
within
the
protective
group.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
pardon
me.
if
the
partner
were
in
the
protective
group
of
persons
covered
by
title
vii,
if
the
partner
believed
that
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
decision
made
by
the
institution
itself
affecting
compensation,
terms,
or
other
conditions
of
employment,
it
would
be
actionable
under
title
vii
in
our
view.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
we
are
saying
that
for
purposes
of
title
vii
the
relationship
between
a
partner
and
a
law
firm
has
sufficient
attributes
of--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--for
purposes
of
title
vii,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
only
consequences,
justice
powell,
of
applying
title
vii
to
either
the
admission
decisions
of
partnership
or
the
compensation
decisions
of
partnership
are
to
outlaw
prohibited
forms
of
discrimination.
it
is
our
view
that
that
is
not
going
to
create
a
great
disruption
within
partnerships,
it
is
not
going
to
diminish
the
quality
of
the
legal
profession,
nor
is
it
going
to
diminish
in
any
way--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--the
question
of
compensation
at
some
later
point.
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
whether
or
not
ms.
hishon
claiming...
that
is
an
associate
in
the
first
instance--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--your
honor,
it
is
not
relevant
other
than
it
is
a
broad
policy
consideration
to
reinforce
the
applicability
of
title
vii
to
law
firms.
lawyers,
after
all,
as
our
adversaries
point
out,
occupy
a
rather
unique
position
within
the
community,
but
it
is
that
position,
we
suggest,
which
advocates
for
and
not
against
coverage
of
title
vii.
it
is
more
important
that
excluded
minorities
progress
within
the
legal
profession
than
in
any
other
capacity,
because
lawyers
are
in
a
unique
position
to
influence
the
course
of
events
in
ways
that
businessmen,
bankers,
corporate
vice
presidents,
and
other
people,
all
of
whom
are
covered
by
title
vii,
do
not
have
the
same
capacity.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
absolutely.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
i
would
also
concede
they
are
subjective
just
as
they
are
in
the
question
of
whom
an
ordinary
business
enterprise
would
employ
for
a
particular
position,
particularly
one
of
higher
than
a
menial
capacity.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
as
long
as
none
of
the
prohibitive
factors
covered
by
title
vii
were
factors
in
the
decision,
the
firm
is
free
to
provide
and
apply
subjective
criteria
in
determining
who
to
admit
to
partnership
and
how
to
award
those
who
it
has
admitted
to
partnership.
but,
it
is
our
view
that
sex
is
not
one
of
those
factors
which
affects
that
decision-making
process
and
that
congress
has
specifically
proscribed
that
as
a
factor.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
under
the
broader
argument
which
we
make,
we
would
take
the
position
that
it
does
apply,
but
the
court
need
not
go
far
as
to
decide
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
the
answer
is
yes.
the
considerations
may
be
subjective.
the
proof
problems
for
the
lawyer
claiming
that
because
he
was
jewish
he
was
turned
down
as
tax
partner
in
a
large
firm
may
be
difficult,
but
they
are
not
insurmountable
and
they
do
not
take
the
claim
outside
the
coverage
of
title
vii.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
not
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
your
honor,
the
aspect
of
the
case
is
a
consensual
relationship
is
a
red
herring.
the
contract--
mr.
emmit
j.
bondurant,
ii
--is
a
red
herring.

the
right
to
contract,
which
cannot
be
withheld
on
the
basis
of
race
under
th
1871
civil
rights
act.
a
contract
is
inherently
consensual.
there
has
been
no
question
of
congress'
power
to
override
the
consensual
aspect
of
that
in
order
to
enforce
a
more
important
provisions
of
the
constitution.
secondly,
and
perhaps
even
more
fundamentally,
this
court
has
never
place
value
on
the
right
to
discriminate
on
invidious
bases
in
either
the
admission
of
black
children
to
white
schools.
the
court
never
thought
that
the
white
children
had
a
right
which
overrode
the
rights
of
black
children
to
the
quality
of
education,
to
be
free
from
that
association.
the
worker
on
the
assembly
line,
the
protestant
had
no
right
to
exclude
the
catholic
or
the
jew
from
working
side
by
side
on
the
assembly
line.
and,
in
the
law
firm,
the
partner
who
is
a
male
has
no
right
to
exclude
the
female
from
enjoying
the
same
opportunities
in
the
professions.
the
first
amendment
has
never
protected
those
rights.
the
only
associational
first
amendment
protection
this
court
has
ever
recognized
was
the
right
to
join
together
to
assert
other
first
amendment
rights
and
that
simply
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
justice
powell
mentioned
the
profit
motive,
that
it
is
inconceivable
in
1983
that
one
motivated
by
profit
would
turn
down
a
competent
partner.
the
same
argument
could
be
made
for
every
business
enterprise
in
this
country,
that
they
would
turn
down
a
more
qualified
person
if
they
were
truly
motivated
by
profit.
but,
your
experience
and
mine
has
been
that
they
have
done
it.
profit
was
never
the
question.
congress
laid
that
question
to
rest
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
it
decided
that
profit
motives
and
morale
suasion
were
never
effective
in
routing
discrimination
out.

of
both
king
&
spalding's
office
and
my
own,
is
a
typical
example.
why
would
a
motel
have
empty
rooms
when
it
could
rent
rooms
to
blacks
and
turn
down
the
profit
opportunity
which
that
presented?
it
did
and
it
defended
that
right
all
the
way
to
this
court.
congress
decided,
in
passing
the
civil
rights
act,
that
the
profit
motive
was
not
sufficient
to
bring
about
the
eradication
of
employment
discrimination
in
this
country.
your
honor
has
asked
about
other
partnerships.
first,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
investment
partnerships
are
implicated
by
this
case.
the
opportunity
for
two
or
three
people
to
form
a
limited
partnership
to
buy
a
piece
of
land
in
rural
georgia
is
not
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
that
is
an
opportunity
to
earn
a
return
on
capital
investment.
thank
you
very--
