mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
submission
in
this
case
is
quite
straightforward
and
we
ask
the
court
in
this
case
not
to
decide
the
difficult
questions
as
to
whether
and
what
extent
partners
may
ever
themselves
be
regarded
as
employees
of
a
partnership.
on
that
question
the
government
has
not
taken
a
position.
we
feel
that
whatever
view
one
takes
on
that
question,
ms.
hishon's
complaint
in
this
case
stated
a
good
cause
of
action
under
title
vii,
because
title
vii
clearly
and
sharply
provides
that
women
employees
may
not
be
treated
worse
than
male
employees,
the
statutory
language
that
there
may
not
be
discrimination
with
respect
to
the
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment.
now,
as
an
associate,
ms.
hishon
and
the
other
associates
of
the
firm
were
concededly
employees
and
her
complaint
alleges
that
she
was
treated
worse
than
the
male
employees
with
respect
to
a
central
element
of
the
employment
relationship,
one
that
is
absolutely
critical
to
every
young
lawyer
at
a
large
firm
like
king
&
spalding.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
lower
courts
have
unanimously
held
and
the
government's
position
has
been
that
the
tenure
decision
is
covered
by
title
vii.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
are
cases.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
they
are
cited
and
in
the
second
and
the
third
circuit.
there
are
cases
so
holding
or
at
least
so
assuming.
there
are
questions
that,
of
course,
go
into
the
question
whether
on
the
particular
facts--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
if
a
law
firm
excluded
women
for
consideration
for
dean
of
a
law
school,
i
believe
that
title
vii
would
be
violated.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
believe
that
it
is
universally
conceded
that
in
hiring
associates
a
law
firm
may
not
exclude.
in
fact,
one
of
the
peculiarities
in
the
position
that
mr.
morgan
has
before
this
court
is
that
he
says
at
the
hiring
level,
where
you
are
bringing
in
associates,
you
cannot
exclude
women,
but,
in
effect,
he
says,
you
can
hire
them
for
a
different
and
discrimination-against
slot;
that
is
for
a
lesser
consideration
when
you
get
to
the
partnership
turn.
as
i
understand
the
position
of
mr.
morgan
and
the
respondent
in
this
case,
it
is
that
the
law
firm
is
wholly
free
to
adopt
an
explicit
role.
for
instance,
that
women
will
be
considered
for
partnership
after
ten
years,
but
men
will
be
considered
after
six
years.
he
says
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--directly
into
the
partnership?
that
is
the
question,
your
honor,
that
the
government--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--it
has
not
taken
a
position.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
selection
of
partners
from
the
outside.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
is
nothing
directly
related
to
law
firms.
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
since
1972
that
a
central
concern
of
congress
was
access
of
discrimination-against
groups,
women,
and
blacks
in
particular,
to
the
higher
professional,
managerial,
and
elite
positions
of
society.
that
issue
was
very
centrally
camped
when
an
amendment
was
proposed
that
would
have
excluded
from
title
vii
the
choice
of
doctors
to
practice
on
the
staff
of
hospitals.
and,
congress
rejected
that
amendment
precisely
on
the
ground
that
it
is
that
kind
of
highly
sensitive
position
as
to
which
congress
was
especially
keen
that
discrimination
should
end.
now,
in
that
respect,
to
us
it
seems
quite
irrelevant
whether
partners
themselves
are
associates.
we
are
quite
willing
for
the
court
to
assume
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
partners
themselves
are
not
employees,
that
they
are
owners,
like
stockholders.
it
is
clear
that
if
a
corporation
with
ten
stockholders
wanted
to
find
new
stockholders
and
went
out
and
sold
stock
to
new
stockholders
that
title
vii
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
but,
if
that
same
corporation
makes
the
ownership
of
stock
part
of
a
stock
plan
for
employees,
then
it
cannot
ration
that
on
sexual
or
racial
grounds.
it
cannot
say
we
will
only
admit
men
to
the
stock
options
plans.
in
other
words,
ownership
is
not
employment,
but
if
ownership
is
distributed
to
the
employees
as
a
regular
practice
as
one
of
the
elements
of
employment,
then
title
vii
cuts
in
and
says
you
cannot
do
it
on
a
racial
or
sexual
ground.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
promoting
or--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--our
argument
is
restricted
to
the
proposition,
justice
white,
that
insofar
as
admission
to
the
partnership
is
a
term,
condition,
and
privilege
of
an
employment
relationship.
so,
if
there
were
no
employment
relationship
theretofore--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
that,
i
guess
would
become
then
subject
to
the
more
general
and
obviously
very
sensitive
question
of
whether
rectifying
previous
discrimination,
to
what
extent
affirmative
action
or
other
plans
would
be
a
problem.
but,
that,
we
think,
would
cut
into
the
general
background
title
vii
law
as
it
applies
to
ordinary
situations;
that
is
there
would
be
no
special
rule
with
respect
to--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes.
if
she
is
an
employee
of
the
firm--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--she
is
now
a
partner.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
she
is
now
a
partner.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
is
a
question
which
i
am
unable
to
answer,
your
honor,
because
it
would
depend
on
this
additional
question,
whether
the
partners
themselves
are
employees.
i
should
put
this
qualification
on
that.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
have
not
joined
the
petitioner
on
that
submission.
the
government
is
arguing
this
case
on
a
narrower
issue
which
relates
entirely
to
the
way
in
which
king
&
spalding
treats
its
associates
and
we
are
saying
for
that
purposes
it
is
irrelevant
whether
the
partners
are
themselves
employees
or
owners
or
whether
you
pierce
the
partnership
veil
as
it
were.
now,
with
respect
to
our
submission--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
this
may
be
a
decreasing
problem,
but
when
congress
acted,
first
in
1964,
and
in
1972,
it
was
a
very
active
problem,
it
was
really
a
virulent
problem.
and,
that
is
the
time
as
of
which
that
statute
speaks.
so,
the
fact...
and
to
some
extent
that
it
is
no
longer
a
problem
is
itself
maybe
a
product
of
title
vii
in
the
background;
that
is
to
say
that
since
everybody
concedes
that
at
the
intake
stage,
when
young
associates
are
first
hired,
title
vii
does
apply.
of
course,
law
firms
have
had
to
accustom
themselves
to
overcoming
these
ancient
prejudices
and
they
have
learned,
we
have
all
learned,
as
we
have
learned
on
faculty,
that,
in
fact,
the
prejudice
was
simply
inexcusable.
and,
that
really,
i
think,
pushes
me
into
what
is
my
last
point
with
respect
to
mr.
morgan's
submission.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
i
will
back
off
and
leave
my
friend
his
time.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
thank
you.
