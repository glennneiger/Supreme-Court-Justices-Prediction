mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
brief
particularly
and
here,
discussing
20
years
as
of
next
year
on
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
has
made
a
point
of
whether
or
not
king
&
spalding
and
lawyers
are
above
the
law
and
whether
or
not
the
case
of
respondent
would
place
them
there.
i
submit
that
it
wouldn't.
of
all
of
the
professions
in
the
united
states
and
probably
of
all
of
the
sundry
people
who
perform
services
in
our
society,
lawyers
are
the
most
regulated.
however,
from
time
to
time
there
are
certain
kinds
of
activities
that
lawyers
find
necessary
for
their
work.
for
instance,
the
privileges
that
are
granted
with
respect
to
the
attorney/client
privilege,
the
fact
that
lawyers
can
state
things
in
courts
that
are
at
least
qualifiedly
privileged
and
often
have
absolute
immunity
from
liable.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--the
structure
of
the
bar
as
well
as
the
structure
of
sundry
courts,
that
lawyers
are
a
member
of
the
bar
over
a
period.
bar
associations,
first
of
all,
do
regulate
lawyers.
lawyers
are
regulated
on
entry
into
the
profession,
all
the
way
through
it,
and
all
the
way
out
of
it,
often
not
as
much
as
they
should
be,
but
certainly
more
than
other
professions
it
seems
to
me.
and,
as
such,
it
is
not
a
question
of
are
lawyers
above
the
law,
but
it
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
congress
intended
to
cover
them
as
to
this
law,
and
it
is
secondly
a
question
as
to
what
protections
lawyers
are
granted
by
the
society
and
by
the
law
and
by
the
constitution
in
order
to
perform
their
necessary
function
in
the
society.
we
submit
to
you
that
lawyers
are
entitled
to
the
highest
degree
of
first
amendment
associational
freedom.
we
submit
that
and
we
think
congress
understood
that
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
you
will
note
in
our
briefs
that
we
have
discussed
the
existence
of
lawyers
in
congress,
the
large
number
of
them
and
the
people
involved
in
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
the
number
of
law
partners
in
congress,
who
didn't
talk
about
lawyers
and
law
partners,
but
did
talk
about
doctors
when
they
made
their
points
that
are
made
in
briefs
about
professional
coverage,
and,
the
fact
that
the
lawyers
in
congress
certainly
had
in
their
minds
that
they
were
lawyers.
now,
they
wanted
to
eliminate,
i
believe,
based
on
only
one
statement
in
the
record,
the
1963
statement
by
congressman
mcculloch.
they
wanted
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
employment
of
professionals.
senator
javits
and
others
discussed
questions
with
respect
to
hospitals
and
the
elimination
of
discrimination
with
respect
to
people
being
able
to
practice
medicine
in
hospitals.
congressman
mcculloch
mentioned
law
along
with
other
professions
in
1963
in
a
preliminary
report.
when
you
turn
to
the
year
1964,
there
is
only
one
statement
involving
partnerships
in
the
record
of
the
debates
which
the
new
york
times
termed
so
voluminous...
i
mean
the
weight
of
them
was
so
gigantic.
and,
that
one
statement
was
made
by
norris
cotton,
senator
cotton,
and
he
was
commenting
on
the
fact...
he
was
speaking
against
the
provision
to
lower
the
coverage
of
employees,
who
at
that
time,
as
i
recall
it,
was
25.
when
senator
cotton
was
speaking,
he
said
this
would
be
so
absurd.
when
you
have
that
small
an
operation,
it
is
almost
like
a
partnership.
now,
that
is
it
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned.
there
is
nothing
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
there
is
nothing
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
is
no
other
intention
of
congress
to
cover
law
partnerships.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
he
came
from
new
hampshire,
but
he
was
also,
as
i
recall
it,
the
senior
partner
in
a
law
firm
in
new
hampshire,
cotton,
tesreau...
i
have
forgotten
the
names.
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
brief.
i
think
he
was
thinking
of
that
partnership
to
start
with,
his
own,
because
he
was,
after
all,
a
partner
in
a
law
firm
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
thought
there
might
be
one,
maybe
two,
but
i
certainly
don't
know.
i
haven't
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
have
not
taken
a
position
to
the
contrary.
we
have
not
taking
any
position--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--it
is
an
employer
of
associates
under
title
vii
which
poses
certain
problems
for
a
portion
of
my
case,
for
example.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
king
&
spalding,
or
any
other
law
firm
employs
lawyers
who
then
sues
king
&
spalding,
there
may
be
an
invasion
of
the
attorney/client
privilege.
according
to
petitioner,
law
partners
and
associates
do
the
same
thing,
there
is
no
difference
between
them.
therefore,
why
shouldn't
a
promotion
system
take
place
as
though
the
law
firm
were
a
corporation?
and,
if
that
took
place,
it
would
be
just
kind
of
a
stair-step
progression
from
a
gs-8
to
a
gs-15
to
a
gs-18
which
must
be
a
partner.
now,
their
contention
then
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
employees
of
the
partnership...
partnerships
are
clearly
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
there
is
hardly
a
way
to
take
another
position
than
the
one
i
just
took.
it
says
partnerships
are
employers.
it
doesn't
say
they
are
employees.
certainly,
if
a
partnership
is
an
employer,
it
is
very
difficult
to
figure
how
partners
would
be
employees.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
think
when
looking
at
congressional
intention,
you
have
to
see
at
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
congress--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--well,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
he
stated,
of
course,
she
would
be
here
anyway
going
right
into
the
firm.
now,
their
position,
both
petitioner...
one
of
petitioner's
three
positions
and
the
position
of
the
solictor
general...
their
position
is
that
terms,
conditions,
and
privileges
of
employment,
that
that
covers
a
promise
to
fairly
consider
an
employee
or
a
prospective
employee
at
the
time
of
hire
and
then
six
years
later
you
are
supposed
to
enforce
it.
now,
let's
see
if
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind,
because,
first
of
all,
the
rules
of
construction
say
that
no
words
in
the
statute
have
surfaced,
you
have
to
consider
the
entire
statute.
first,
it
is
the
equal
employment
opportunities
act
that
creates
an
equal
employment
opportunities
commission.
the
solicitor
general
states
if
there
is
either
a
pension
plan
or
he
was
talking
about
a
stock
option
plan
with
a
corporation,
that
it
would
have
to
be
treated
equally
for
everybody
and
i
agree
with
that.
but,
in
this
particular
instance,
where
you
have
terms,
conditions,
privileges
of
employment
and
you
get
into
those
words,
you
run
squarely
into
the
rest
of
the
congressional
intention
which
is
clearly
stated
in
the
following
way:
it
says...
and,
it
defines
people.
when
it
gets
to
members,
it
is
talking
about
labor
organizations,
not
partnerships.
when
it
gets
to
"it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
discriminate.
"
it
then
goes
on
"with
respect
to
terms,
conditions,
or
privileges
of
employment.
"
now,
remember,
these
outsiders
they
were
talking
about
bringing
into
the
firm
and
king
&
spalding
has
many
of
those.
that
is
in
the
record.
there
is
no
set
way
here
as
for
that
swaine
and
moore
had
of
the
lucido
case
coming
straight
up
where
they
took
in
nobody.
now,
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
petitioner
would
say
you
need
go
no
further
with
respect
to
the
ramifications
of
your
decision.
you
need
not
even
think
about
remedy
because
we
do
not
want
to
be
in
the
partnership,
therefore,
just
consider
it
my
way
within
this
structure.
it
strikes
me
that
is
not
the
way
the
court
should
do
business.
i
think
you
have
to
think
about
the
ramifications
of
it
and
what
the
true
intention
is.
another
phrase:
"it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
"
employment
practice.
it
says
that
a
person
can't
limit
or
segregate
or
classify
his
employees
or
applicants
for
employment
in
any
way
which
would
deprive
any
individual
of
employment
opportunities
or
otherwise
adversely
affect
his
status
as
an
employee.
now,
that
is
what
petitioner
didn't
like,
was
a
status
as
employee.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
the
act
is
not
applicable
to
partnerships,
so
consequently
they
could
do
that.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
it
would
be
permissible
as
a...
it
would
be
permissible
as
a
disparate
treatment
if
they
just
did
that.
let
me
give
you...
let
me
strike
an
example.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
put
it
in
the
employment
booklet,
just
like
is
happening
all
over
the
country
now
as
these
job-right
cases
are
developing
under
state
law.
employers,
some
of
them,
except
for
those
who
are
frightened
of
doing
it,
are
putting
on
the
face
of
it,
you
should
understand
that
you
acquire
no
rights
when
you
come
here.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
i
lay
it
out
when
the
associate
is
hired--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--and
i
tell
the
associate
at
the
time
of
hire
that
later
the
associate
will
have
to
work
here
for
ten
years
before
the
associate
could
become
partner.
well,
i
think
we
are
assuming
something
that
not
even,
of
course,
the
complaint
says,
but
as
far
as
the--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
am
saying
two
things.
one,
if
i
say
that
outright
as
a
partnership,
i
just
tell
folks,
whether
i
tell
them
in
writing
or
tell
them
orally
and
i
just
say,
look,
it
takes
eight
years
for
women
to
be
good
lawyers
and
six
years
for
men
to
get
to
be
good
lawyers
and
then
we
are
going
to
consider
them.
the
answer
is
did
congress
desire
to
cover
the
partnership
decision?
my
answer
is
no,
not
under
title
vii.
might
there
be
an
actional
square,
sure.
could
the
action
be
brought,
sure,
but
not
under
title
vii
and
the
second
answer.
if
you
take
justice
powell's
statement
about
why
in
the
world
would
a
partner
want
to
keep
out
someone
whose
is
going
to
make
them
a
profit,
which
happens
to
be
the
theme
of
petitioner's
case...
petitioner
says,
good
heavens,
law
firms
are
businesses
and
we
are
making
all
of
this
money
all
over
the
world
and
that
is
the
central
theme
of
law
practice.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
any
law
firm
who
would
make
such
am
averment
of
six
and
eight
year
differentials
to
employees
at
a
law
school
in
the
united
state
from
which
they
hire,
would
be
laughed
off
the
campus
and
would
promptly
go
out
of
business.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--that
is
my
position.
it
was
so
obvious
and
so
apparent
that
three
decisions
of
this
court
surely
would
apply.
one
of
them
is,
of
course,
catholic
bishop.
secondly...
a
second
decision
that
would
apply
would
be
yeshiva,
because
they
identify,
and
the
third
decision
would
bell
aerospace.
you
know,
congress
can
sit
over
there
and
they
can't
think
of
every
crazy
thing
somebody
is
going
to
bring
up
and
if
they
did,
then
they
would
write
an
exception
in
for
that.
but,
in
this
particular
instance,
congressman
mcculloch,
chairman,
himself
a
partner
in
a
law
firm,
congressman
seller
who
had
been
with
a
law
firm
previously
and
may
have
been
at
the
time,
but
he
was
previously,
and
partners
in
law
firms
sitting
there,
some
of
them,
could
never
even
conceive
that
anyone
was
going
to
come
and
say,
well,
we
are
going
to
make
partners
under
title
vii.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
as
far
as
congress
was
concerned
all
of
them
were.
there
is
higher
protection
to
law
firms
than
accountants
and
there
were
more
lawyers...
i
was
talking
about
lawyers
because
lawyers
were
are
in
congress--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--sure.
there
is
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind.
that
is
what
justice
goldberg
wrote
there
within
two
or
three
days
of
the
passage
of
the
act
in
his
concurring
opinion.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
[laughter]
if
we
forgot
it
was
lawyers,
we
would
be
like
congress
forgetting
to
write
and
exception.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
in
most
of
those
you
do
not...
are
they
all
in
the
same
category,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
that
is
what...
let
me
complete
that.
no
partnership
in
terms
of
entry,
however,
that
question
is
not
before
the
court.
the
question
that
is
before
the
court,
because
no
constitutional
question
is
implied
with--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
oh,
no.
i
think...
in
the
first
place,
assuming
that
all
business
partnerships
have
a
right
of
commercial
association,
then
they
would
be
covered
and
they
would
have
a
lower
standard
of
constitutional
rights
with
respect
to
what
is
done
to
them
by
the
government
through
the
eeoc,
which
would
assume
jurisdiction,
than
is
a
law
firm
which
is
an
advocacy
organization
if
there
has
ever
been
one.
that
is
why
law
partnerships
are
different
from
other
partnerships
and
that
is
what
is
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no,
that
is
not...
what
we
say
is
that
law
firms
are
advocacy
organizations
which
handle
litigation
as
was
pointed
out
in
naacp
in
button.
in
the
button
case,
we
talked
particularly,
the
court
did,
about
use
of
litigation
to
political
ends.
law
firms
certainly
are
constantly
petitioning
congress,
petitioning
for
a
redress
of
grievance
in
court
or
out
of
court,
and
doing
those
things
that
are
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
that
is
what
we
say
about
the
advocacy
rights
of
law
firms.
as
far
as
whether
or
not
that
gives
them
a
higher
standard
of
protection,
surely
it
does
when
a
question
is
asked
in
an
interrogatory
such
as
here
by
the
plaintiff,
which
could
be
asked
in
the
eeoc,
just
in
the
case
preceding.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
your
honor,
as
i
recall,
on
the
minimum
wage,
they
would
come
off
as
a
professional
exemption,
but--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--all
right.
as
far
as
the
purely
business
and
economic
aspects
of
law
firms,
to
wit,
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
minimum
wage
laws,
i
think
you
are
right.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
because
what
it
does
is
it
takes
in
this
particular
instance
and
places
an
advocacy
agency
of
the
federal
government
overseeing
the
law
firms.
the
case
you
just
heard
before
this
case
involving
eeo-1
reports,
in
that
particular
case...
law
firms
file
them
too.
they
don't
file
partners,
you
know,
numbers
of
partners
as
employees,
they
just
file
associates.
now,
the
eeoc
decides
to
go
against
a
law
firm.
it
has
a
subpoena
power
and
it
can
subpoena
the
law
firm's
documents.
in
this
particular
case,
king
&
spalding's
responses,
as
are
contained
in
the
record
and
the
district
court,
say
she
didn't
get
along
with
our
clients
in
effect
amongst
other
things
and
those
are
the
reasons
we
didn't
admit
her.
now,
at
that
point,
they
asked
an
interrogatory
question
and
the
interrogatory
question
goes
directly
to
the
questions
of
what
matters
did
you
handle
for
clients,
what
matters
did
she
have
problems
with,
who
do
you
represent?
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
certainly
hope
not,
but
lawyers
are
different.
lawyers
are
essential
to
the
enforcement
of
the
constitution.
let
me
give
you
some
examples.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
no,
no.
congress
did
not
exempt
lawyers
from
their
hiring
policies.
congress--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--congress
exempted
partnerships
as
employees
and
partners
as
employees.
we
raised
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
to
come
under
catholic
bishop
and
other
cases
to
demonstrate
a
rule
of
construction
with
respect
to
the
statute
which
says
that
the
statute
should
not
be
interpreted
in
such
a
manner
as
would
require
a
restriction
of
the
constitutional
liberties
that
do
attach
the
law
firms
with
respect
to
their
duties
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
a
lease
case
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stevens
and
mr.
justice
brennan
talking
in
terms
of
going
across
the
country
and
lawyers
almost
having
a
due
process
property
right
and
the
right
to
practice
and
to
hire
lawyers
being
involved
in
the
representation
they
do.
just
brennan
talking
about
the
naacp
versus
button,
that
it
was
not
the
equal
protection
clause
that
mattered,
it
was
this,
like
a
firm
of
lawyers--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--but,
you
see--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
hope
not.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
if
it
is,
nobody
would
want
in.
now,
let
me
just
mention
to
you
from
naacp
versus
button--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
the
eleventh
circuit.
that
is
our
argument.
our
argument
goes
beyond
that
because
law
firms
are
involved
as
first
amendment
protected
entities.
that
is
the
only
reason
we
have
brought
in
the
first
amendment.
we
don't
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application.
you
don't
get
to
that
under
what
we
interpret.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
we
go
into
it
in
depth
in
brief.
we
do
talk
about
it
and
when
i
go
to
that
associational
right,
i
go
to
the
button
case
and
i
go
to
justice
brennan's
words
in
there.
and,
it
says
the
protections
in
button
would
apply
as
fully
to
those
who
would
arouse
our
society
against
the
objectives
of
the
petitioner.
expression...
the
constitution
protects
expression
and
association
without
regard
to
race,
creed,
political
affiliations,
truth,
popularity
or
even
social
utility
of
the
ideas
and
beliefs.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
as
far
as
partnership
coverage
of
title
vii,
yes,
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
them.
as
far
as
the
rules
that
apply
to
lawyers,
no.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
their
partnerships,
yes.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
in
partnerships,
yes,
sir.
if
they
are
a
partnership,
they
can
do
so.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
well,
sir--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
not
you
legislating
it,
but
since
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
record
of
congress
that
they
desired
to
cover
partnerships
as
anything
other
than
employers--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--only
one
sentence
that
would
indicate
it
and
that
is
senator
norris
cotton,
and
he
comes
close
to
saying,
this
is
crazy
folks,
this
would
be
as
bad
as--
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
--it
excludes
partners
as
employees
by
including
them
as
employers.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
understand
the
government's
argument.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
yes,
i
would.
mr.
charles
morgan,
jr.
i
understand
the
problem
with
the
phrase.
it
is
not
a
popular
thing
to
say,
but
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
that.
if
you
take
ferri
versus
ackerman,
which
came
out
on
the
criminal
justice
act
of
1964,
considered
by
the
same
congress
at
the
same
time,
their
desire
was
to
maintain
the
independence
of
lawyers
from
government.
now,
that
desire
happens
to
be
something
that
you
go
under
with
with
the
eeoc,
a
government
agency
going
after
law
firms
which
litigate
against
them.
and,
i
know,
as
some
others
do,
that
there
are
times
and
places
in
this
world
when
a
lawyer
defending
people,
sometimes
unpopular
and
sometimes
unpopular
causes,
had
best
be
able
to
select
his
own
partners
because
if
he
can't
or
she
can't,
he
is
not
going
to
be
on
the
firing
line
defending
the
rights
expressed
by
the
highest
court
and
the
highest
ideals
in
our
country.
