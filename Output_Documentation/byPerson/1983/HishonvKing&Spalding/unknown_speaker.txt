unknown
speaker
high
compensated
as
compared
to
the
judiciary?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
see.
a
slight
question
as
to
where
you
put
the
comma,
isn't
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
did
they
all
become
partners?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
would
still
be
here
if
the
ultimate
decision
was
that
based
on
sex
or
race?
unknown
speaker
so,
consideration
isn't
what
you
are
really
talking
about
i
don't
suppose.
you
can
consider
all
you
want
to,
but
if
the
bottom
line
is
you
don't
get
into
this
partnership
because
of
your
sex,
you
would
still
be
here
making
the
argument,
but
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
selection
of
a
partner
may
not
be
based
on
that.
unknown
speaker
you
are
using
too
many
words
then.
you
may
not
select
partners
based
on
sex
or
race.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
win
on
that
basis,
if,
in
hiring
associates,
the
law
firm
says
that
we
will
make
our
selection
of
partners
unrestricted
by
the
terms
and
conditions
of
title
vii,
would
that
get
them
off
the
hook?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
it
isn't
a
term
and
condition
of
employment.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
a
legal
term.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
it
is
imposed
by
the
operation
of
law,
not
by
contract.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bondurant,
what
part
does
the
representation
by
the
firm
play
over
and
above
what
the
law
otherwise
requires?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
plays
no
part,
how
can
it
reinforce?
unknown
speaker
supposing...
do
they
still
have
that
15-employee
limit
in
title
vii
where
people
employing
less
than
15
aren't
covered
by
it?
unknown
speaker
supposing
a
firm
with
15
or
fewer
employees
made
a
representation
that
we
are
an
equal
opportunity
employer
and
we
follow
all
the
guidelines
of
the
eeoc,
would
that
be
actionable
under
title
vii
even
though
they
had
less
than
15
employees?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bondurant,
let's
assume
that
the
petitioner
had
been
admitted
to
partnership
in
king
&
spalding
and
two
or
three
years
after
young
partners
of
the
same
rough
age
and
experience
were
up
for
promotion
within
the
firm,
be
entitled
to
a
greater
percentage
of
participation,
would
your
position
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that.
unknown
speaker
you
have
touched
on
two
or
three
factual
situations.
your
answer
is,
with
respect
to
any
change
in
status
within
a
partnership
down
through
the
years,
any
partner
may
claim
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
or
race?
unknown
speaker
don't
go
quite
so
fast.
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
a
partner
is
an
employee
of
the
firm
always?
unknown
speaker
can't
you
just
answer
that
question?
we
are
dealing
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
title
vii
applies.
it
only
applies
if
an
individual
is
an
employee.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
a
partner,
once
a
partner,
always
is
a
employee
for
purposes
of
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and,
every
year
when
participation
is
reconsidered
the
firm
would
be
confronted
with
this
sort
of
a
litigation?
unknown
speaker
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
relevant
whether
your
view
of
the
case
or
your
friend's
view
of
the
case
would
enhance
or
do
otherwise
to
a
particular
law
firm
or
to
law
firms
generally?
is
that
relevant?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bondurant,
would
you
concede
that
judgments
are
made
with
respect
to
a
variety
of
qualifications
when
the
partnership
decision
is
made?
unknown
speaker
and,
many
of
those
judgments
are
subjective.
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
possible
a
firm
may
need
somebody
to
do
damage
suit
litigation
and
if
an
individual
in
competition
with
that
associate
was
very
good
at
corporate
law,
would
those
factors
be
considered?
unknown
speaker
and,
one
more
question.
suppose
a
law
firm
needed
a
new
tax
partner
and
the
word
got
around
and
half
a
dozen
people,
established
tax
lawyers
applied.
i
am
talking
now
not
of
an
associateship,
but
a
partnership,
would
title
vii
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
asked
you
whether
it
would
apply
and
you
answered
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
so
early,
but
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
tell
me...
perhaps
this
is
not
a
fair
questions...
does
title
vii
apply
to
the
faculty
of
a
law
school?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
about
the
tenure
decision?
does
it
apply
to
that?
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
so
holding?
unknown
speaker
are
they
cited
in
your
brief?
i
just
haven't--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
apply
all
the
way
up
the
line
to
associate
professor,
to
full
professor,
to
chair
professor?
unknown
speaker
to
the
dean?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
very
bottom
of
a
law
firm?
how
about
hiring?
unknown
speaker
what
about
lateral
entry
to
partnerships?
unknown
speaker
it
is
withholding
a
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
to
insulate
decisions
regarding
the
selection
of
partners
from
title
vii's
provision?
unknown
speaker
right.
or--
--from
the
inside.
--from
the
inside,
either
way.
unknown
speaker
could
you
have...
i
take
it
then
the
government
would
say
the
law
firm
couldn't
take
sex
into
consideration
at
all
even
for
affirmative
action
purposes
or
for
quota
purposes.
unknown
speaker
no,
entry
into
the
partnership.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
know,
but
i
am
talking
about
this
case
where
there
was
an
employment
relationship
and
the
law
firm
says,
well,
i
think
we
ought
to
have
six
or
eight
lady
partners
but
no
more
or
we
should
have
20
or
30
but
no
more.
unknown
speaker
would
title
vii
apply
to
a
situation
where
a
woman
or
any
other
person
claiming
the
protection
of
the
act
has
pointed
out
that
for
the
ten
years
that
she
had
been
in
the
firm
she
had
never
been
assigned
a
case
to
argue
in
the
courts
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
and
that
was
an
area
reserved
for
men...
that
would
be
the
claim...
and,
in
fact,
the
record
would
show
that
only
men
had
been
assigned
those
assignments.
would
that
be
cognizable
under
the
act?
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute,
a
partner
now.
unknown
speaker
we
have
gotten
over
the
hump.
unknown
speaker
she
is
now
a
partner.
unknown
speaker
your
friend
said
the
partners
aren't
employees.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you
another
question?
unknown
speaker
in
the
year
1983,
with
a
third
of
the
students
in
the
law
schools
of
the
united
states,
is
this
really
a
problem.
and,
i
ask
one
supplemental
question.
if
you
are
a
partner
in
a
law
firm,
you
are
very
careful
about
selecting
new
partners
because
it
affects
your
profits.
in
other
words,
you
want
the
strongest
possible
person
regardless
of
sex,
color,
or
race.
that
may
not
have
been
true
20
or
30
years
ago
when
people
had
lots
of
prejudices
they
don't
have
now,
but
i
can't
imagine
a
law
firm
deliberately
discriminating
against
somebody
if
the
firm
made
a
judgment
that
the
individual
would
increase
the
profits
of
the
law
firm.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
i
grasp
what
you
meant
by
the
statement
that
they
are
the
most
regulated.
regulated...
which
regulation
are
you
speaking
of--
unknown
speaker
--the
structure
of
the
bar
or
the
potential
of
a
particular
court?
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
a
partnership
do
you
suppose
senator
cotton
was
thinking
of
coming,
as
he
did,
from
new
hampshire?
unknown
speaker
but,
a
lot
of
the
partnership
problems
that
you
refer
to
in
your
brief,
seems
to
me
are
covered
by
the
15
employee
requirement,
you
know,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
small
partnership.
are
there
any
15
member
law
firms
in
new
hampshire?
[laughter]
you
know
there
are
not,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morgan,
you
concede
though,
i
guess,
that
the
law
partnership
of
over
15
associates
is
an
employer
of
the
associates
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
now.
you
surely
agree
that
it
is
an
employer
under
title
vii
of
the
associates.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
that,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well...
but,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
says
you
don't
have
to
decide
that.
all
you
have
to
do
to
decide
this
case
is
to
decide
whether
the
associate
is
an
employee
and,
therefore,
is
fair
consideration
without
regard
to
sex
a
term
or
a
condition
of
that
employment?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
about
the
hypothetical
question
the
solicitor
general
gave?
supposing
the
firm
had
a
rule
that
male
associates
are
eligible
for
partnerships
after
six
years
and
female
associates
are
eligible
for
partnerships
after
ten
years.
would
that
comply
with
the
act?
what
is
your
view
of
that?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
permissible
disparate
treatment
on
the
basis
of
sex?
unknown
speaker
if
they
write
it
out,
that
is
the
rule.
when
they
come
here
they
tell
the
women
you
will
be
eligible
in
ten
years
and
they
tell
the
male
employees
you
will
be
eligible
in
six
years.
unknown
speaker
no.
my
hypothesis
is
that
you
acquire...
if
you
are
a
male,
you
acquire
the
right
to
be
considered
for
a
partnership
after
six
years,
if
you
are
a
female,
you
acquire
that
right
after
ten
years.
now,
why
doesn't
that
fall
right
squarely
within
the
language
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
legal
position,
i
think,
has
to
say
that
in
the
eighth
year
the
male
and
females
are
not
being
discriminated
against...
are
not
being
treated
differently
on
account
of
sex.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morgan,
on
this...
on
carving
out
this
exemption
for
law
firms,
with
the
number
of
law
firm
representatives
in
congress,
why
didn't
they
spell
it
out
if
they
intended
to
do
it?
one,
they
knew
how
to
spell
it
out,
and,
two,
they
were
lawyers.
am
i
not
correct
that
every
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
in
the
house
is
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
they
drafted
this
bill.
how
can
you
say
they
didn't
mean
to
cover
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
out
of
all
the
partnerships
that
you
can
imagine,
law
partnerships
were
alone
exempt
or
are
you
suggesting
that
all
kinds
of
partnerships
were
exempt?
unknown
speaker
so,
your
submission
really
is
that
no
partnerships
are
covered
by
this
insofar
as
entry
is
concerned
into
the
partnership?
unknown
speaker
so,
we
should
judge
this
case
as
though
this
were
a
partnership
of
engineers
or--
unknown
speaker
--rather
than
lawyers.
can't
we
just
forget
it
is
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
justice
white's
question
and
your
response
has
confused
me.
are
real
estate
partnerships,
banking
partnerships,
medical
partnerships
all
in
the
same
category
under
title
vii,
whatever
that
category
is?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
answered
me
that
no
partnership
was
subject
to
title
vii
in
terms
of
entry.
unknown
speaker
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
would
cover
any
partnership.
unknown
speaker
your
submission
would
cover
any
partnership
for
rationale
for
your
position.
unknown
speaker
what
cases
from
this
court
support
you
in
suggesting
that
lawyers
have
this
very
high
claim
to
resist
government
regulations
because
they
are
advocates.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
congress
is
not
trying
to
deter
advocacy
expressly,
it
is
saying
that
law
firms
are
going
to
be
subject
to
minimum
wage
laws,
maybe
they
have
to
bargain
collectively
with
representatives
of
their
employees,
they
are
subject
to
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
i
wouldn't
think
that
any
of
those
things
raised
and
constitutional
question
whatever.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
congress
decided
to
repeal
a
professional
exemption.
unknown
speaker
but,
we
are
not
dealing
with
purely
business...
you
apparently
feel
there
is
some
higher,
loftier
goal
of
law
firm
than
making
money.
and,
even,
let's
put
in
that
higher,
loftier
goal.
why
can't
congress
do
just
what
it
wants
to
with
respect
to
law
firms
with
minimum
wages,
civil
rights,
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
that
assumes
that
lawyers
in
their
dealings
would
need
confidentiality
in
a
way
that
lots
of
other
organizations
don't.
i
dare
say
that
shell
oil,
which
was
the
party
to
the
prior
case,
probably
has
a
lot
of
papers
they
would
like
to
keep
from
the
government
about
hiring
decisions
in
their
top
echelon,
but
i
don't
think
they
have
had
the
affrontery
or
perhaps
ambitious
visions
of
their
business
yet
to
say
that
the
constitution
prevents
the
government
from
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morgan,
now
congress
knew
full
well
how
to
write
exemptions
from
title
vii
and
it
put
in
three.
and,
you
are
asking
us
to
just
produce
another
one
out
of
some
abstract
concept
about
lawyers.
if
congress
had
intended
to
have
this
exemption,
wouldn't
it
have
said
so?
unknown
speaker
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
little
different.
the
naacp
was
a
non-profit
corporation.
unknown
speaker
and,
your
client
is
not
a
non-profit--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
is,
i
was
getting
ready
to
say
you
are
in
bad
shape.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
what
differences
does
it
make
to
your
case
and
your
arguments
whether
the
proposition
you
are
advancing
applies
to
medical
partnerships,
real
estate
partnerships,
and
engineering
partnerships?
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
a
partnership
of
any
kind
is
a
consensual
arrangement
and
governmental
power
can't
intrude
into
consensual
relationships.
and,
i
have
understood
that
was
about
the
theme
of
the
fourth
circuit,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
mentioned
the
right
of
association
which
we
have
said
is
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
does
that
apply
to
stockbrokerage
partnership
firms
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
can
exclude
all
women
and
all
minorities?
unknown
speaker
in--
unknown
speaker
--what
you
want
us
to
do
is
to
write
an
exemption
that
congress
didn't
write
and
then
there
would
be
people...
i
won't
say
you...
but
there
will
be
some
people
who
will
say
we
are
legislating.
is
that
what
you
want?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
us
to
legislate?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
word
that
says
they
didn't
intend--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
not
really
saying
there
is
only
one
question.
the
act
itself
doesn't
exclude
lawyers,
law
firms,
and
these
associates
are
employees
and
you
concede
the
law
firm
is
an
employer.
so,
that...
we
do
need
to
go
to
legislative
history,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
neither...
the
government's
position
doesn't
go
to
whether
a
partner
is
an
employee.
it
is
a
much
narrower
ground
that
the
associate
is
an
employee
and
part
of
his
terms
of
employment
is
fair
consideration.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask,
what
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
cover
law
firms
and
intended
to
cover
the
admission
of
partners.
let's
just
suppose
it
was
clear
as
a
bell.
would
you
be
here
arguing
it
was
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
to
say
that
i
would
suppose.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
mentioned
the
right
of
association
which
we
have
given
a
very
high
place
to
in
our
opinions.
is
the
right
of
association
impeded
or
infringed
on
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
people
