mr.
herbert
shafer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
for
three
reasons.
the
first
relates
to
the
closure
of
a
suppression
hearing
over
a
defendant's
objections.
the
second
relates
to
the
statute
which
authorizes
warrantless
seizure
of
"property
subject
to
forfeiture",
and
it
was
upheld
by
the
court
below.
and
the
third
relates
to
the
proper
remedy
when
police
treat
an
otherwise
valid
warrant
as
a
license
to
conduct
a
totally
indiscriminate
search
and
a
warrantless
seizure.
i
will
address
these
issues
each
in
turn.
first
the
closure.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
constitution
guarantees
open
suppression
hearings,
that
suppression
hearings
may
only
be
closed
upon
a
demonstration
of
compelling
justification,
and
then
only
if
no
means
short
of
closure
will
achieve
the
compelling
state
purpose.
mr.
herbert
shafer
justice
rehnquist,
we
would
not
rest
on
so
technical
a
ground.
philosophically,
the
societal
and
defendant's
interests
are
in
this
context
so
broad
that
we
would
not
urge
that
the
mere
impaneling
of
a
jury
is
the
predicate
for
the
position
we
urge.
we
say
that,
irrespective
of
whether
a
jury
has
or
has
not
been
impaneled,
that
the
interests
are
so
broad
and
so
compelling
that
closure,
particularly
over
a
defendant's
objections,
as
in
this
case,
cannot
be
squared
with
the
sixth
amendment's
commands.
nor,
bearing
in
mind
society's
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
criminal
justice
system--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--the
remedy
for
that
violation,
because
it
is
such
an
egregious
affront
to
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
open
proceedings
during
the
entire
course
of
criminal
proceedings,
and
to
the
first
amendment,
that
there
can
be
only
one
remedy
without
trivializing
the
significance
of
both
of
these
amendments,
and
that
would
be
to
send
it
back
for
a
new
trial
in
its
entirety.
mr.
herbert
shafer
nothing
short
of
that,
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
shafer
to
treat
it
as
a
mere
procedural
quirk,
without
cloaking
it
with
all
the
grandeur
of
these
two
amendments,
is
to
demean
it.
it's
too
grave
an
affront
to
both
of
these
amendments
to
treat
it
as
anything
other
than--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
herbert
shafer
justice
blackmun,
we
respectfully
suggest
not.
as
in
the
case
of
a
grand
jury
not
being
properly
constituted,
this
court
has
not
sent
cases
touching
upon
that
infirmity
back
for
the
impaneling
of
a
new
grand
jury,
but
has
vacated
the
conviction
and
sent
it
back
for
a
trial
de
novo.
we
believe
that
openness
is
of
equal
significance
and
that
it
requires
a
new
trial
rather
than
sending
it
back
for
a
suppression
hearing.
there's
a
more
practical,
there's
a
pragmatic
reason
why
this
case
should
not
be
sent
back.
mr.
herbert
shafer
i
don't
think
you
can
escape
the
fundamental
affront
for
the
closure.
mr.
herbert
shafer
i
would
say
irrespective
of
what
the
result
is.
i
think
that
this
court
cannot
countenance
closed
hearings.
it's
too
important
from
the
standpoint
of
society,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant.
it's
something
he's
entitled
to
and
ought
to
have.
mr.
herbert
shafer
the
problem
is
i
couldn't
get
here
if
he
were
acquitted,
justice
burger.
mr.
herbert
shafer
conceivably
i
might,
but
realistically,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
seems--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--if
he
were
acquitted?
i
would
still
feel
some
discomfiture,
though,
nevertheless,
that
over
a
defendant's
protests
a
courtroom
in
this
republic
was
closed.
mr.
herbert
shafer
i
know
of
none,
your
honor.
but
i
was
trying
to
answer
justice
burger's
questions
and
i
knew
of
no
other
way
to
do
it.
i
withdraw
it.
no,
the
constitution
does
not
protect
my
discomfiture.
it
does
protect
the
discomfiture
of
the
public,
and
that
is
one
of
the
underlying
reasons
why
we
have
open
hearings.
and
to
that
extent,
an
affront
to
the
public
if
there
is
an
acquittal
cannot
be
cured,
and
for
that
reason
there
should
never
be
any
countenancing
of
closed
courtrooms
under
our
scheme
of
criminal
justice.
there
was
no
justification
for
closure
in
this
case.
the
state
asked
for
closure
on
the
basis
of
a
state
law
that
the
state
claimed
would
disable
it
from
future
use
of
wiretap
evidence.
whether
or
not
this
is
so
is
something
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
decide.
and
even
if
the
statute
were
held
to
require
closure
in
this
case
while
the
state
played
its
tapes,
the
statute
could
not
conceivably
authorize
closure
for
the
rest
of
the
seven-day
hearing,
and
the
tapes
took
two
and
a
half
hours
to
play.
nothing
in
the
record
justified
closure.
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
the
trial
court
legitimately
balanced.
it
balanced
nothing.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
balance.
the
georgia
supreme
court's
ipse
dixit
cannot
substitute
for
a
trial
court
record
that
simply
does
not
exist,
and
the
trial
court
made
no
specific
findings
and
closure
was
improper.
and
of
course,
the
court
perceives,
quite
rightly,
the
question
of
remedy
here,
and
i
trust
that
i
need
not
allude
to
that
further.
moving
to
the
second
issue,
if
the
court
please,
and
that
deals
with
the
facial
validity
of
section
16-14-7(f)
of
the
georgia
code.
we
submit
that
we're
dealing
with
a
very
special
and
a
very
dangerous
type
of
statute.
the
statute
purports
to
afford
basic
fourth
amendment
protections
in
authorizing
the
warrantless
seizure
of
property
subject
to
forfeiture.
it
permits
a
state
officer
to
seize
such
property
without
a
warrant
only
if
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
such
property
is
subject
to
forfeiture,
and
then
only
if
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
property
will
be
lost
or
destroyed
if
not
seized.
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
construed
the
statute
to
permit
warrantless
seizure
only
if
it
is
incident
to
a
lawful
search,
arrest,
or
inspection.
that's
pretty
awesome
stuff,
and
it
seems
to
comport
facially
with
the
fourth
amendment.
yet
we
nevertheless
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
facially
invalid.
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
constitutes
an
open
invitation
to
lawless
police
action
so
long
as
property
subject
to
forfeiture
is
so
broadly
defined
and
so
long
as
the
judgment
required
to
determine
whether
such
property
is
associated
with
a
pattern
of
racketeering
activity--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
raise
this
question--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--we're
unable
to
say,
justice
o'connor,
what
was
suppressed
and
what
wasn't
suppressed
and
whether
it
was
within
the
four
corners
of
the
warrant.
and
the
reason
that
we're
not
able
to
say
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
because
the
trial
court
resisted
each
and
every
attempt
we
made
to
present
evidence
on
that
question,
whether
in
fact
what
was
seized
was
the
result
of
a
pretextual
warrant
in
the
nature
of
a
hoax
perpetrated
on
an
issuing
judge
and
subverted,
corrupted
into
a
general
seizure;
whether,
had
the
deponents
disclosed
to
the
issuing
judge
what
their
intent
was,
whether
he
would
then
have
authorized
or
not
authorized
them
to
conduct
the
sort
of
search
that
they
did.
mr.
herbert
shafer
but
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
authorized
to
be
seized.
we
don't
know...
excuse
me.
we
do
know
what
was
suppressed,
but
what
we
don't
know
was
what
was
left,
whether
that
was
legitimately
permitted
to
come
in.
that's
the
problem.
we
don't
know
that
anything
should
have
come
in
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
judge,
had
he
permitted
the
officers
to
obtain
the
warrant
and
who
were
animated
and
guided
by
the
authorization
in
the
warrant...
whether
they
did
what
they
were
supposed
to
do,
and
if
they
didn't
whether
they
converted
this
otherwise
facially
valid
warrant
into
a
general
search.
mr.
herbert
shafer
well,
justice
o'connor,
all
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
is
this.
we
may
have
a
problem
with
that,
and
if
so
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
it.
but
i
remind
the
court
that
the
failure
to
make
a
clearer
record
was
not
due
to
any
conduct
on
our
part.
we
did
everything
we
could.
we
tried
to
get
the
police
officers
to
come
in
to
testify.
the
court
said
it
wasn't
interested
in
it.
we
ain't
going
to
try
no
search
warrant,
if
i
recall,
was
the
response
of
the
court.
the
district
attorney
acknowledged
that
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
was
in
issue,
at
the
suppression
transcript
page
3,
10
and
11.
the
record
is
permeated
with
allusions
to
the
rico
statute
and
to
the
fact
that
the
searches
were
conducted
under
the
authority
of
the
statute.
some
of
the
agents
so
testified,
some
of
the
searching
officers
so
testified.
mr.
herbert
shafer
fulton
county.
mr.
herbert
shafer
sir?
mr.
herbert
shafer
right
in
atlanta.
the
searches
and
seizures
were
virtually,
i
believe,
in
11
or
12
counties,
at
160,
170
homes,
287
individuals
named
in
the
warrant
to
be
searched,
and
they
didn't
stop
there.
they
had
a
picnic.
they
just
went
on
and
on.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
minimally,
if
the
court
has
some
discomfiture,
if
i
may
use
that
bad
phrase,
with
whether
the
statute
is
fully
before
the
court,
minimally
there
ought
to
be
a
remand
so
that
we
can
argue
that
question.
mr.
herbert
shafer
well,
justice
rehnquist,
this
issue
has
troubled
me
a
great
deal,
but
i
have
given
the
court
the
very
best
answer
that
i
can
and
i
have
to
live
and
die
with
it.
the
mischief
with
this
statute,
if
i
may
discuss
that
briefly.
this
statute
authorizes
police
officers
to
do
anything
they
want
to
do.
it's
an
invitation
to
anarchy
in
the
context
of
search
and
seizure.
in
spite
of
the
noble
purposes
set
out
in
the
statute
and
in
spite
of
the
gloss
put
on
those
purposes
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
in
actuality
to
expect
a
police
officer
conducting
a
search
and
seizure
to
determine
whether
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
all
the
property
of
an
individual's
home
is
subject
to
forfeiture
or
is
part
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
or
is
subject
under
rico
to
forfeiture
is
like
placing
a
10b-5
statement
before
him
and
having
him
determine
whether
it
complies
with
the
securities
laws.
in
practical
effect,
such
a
statute
would
either
never
be
applied
because
it
is
manifestly
unreasonable
to
expect
an
officer
to
make
such
a
probable
cause
determination,
or
the
statute
would
be
applied
despite
its
purported
probable
cause
requirement.
in
short,
the
statute
would
stand
as
an
invitation
to
lawless
police
action,
which
is
precisely,
precisely,
what
happened
here.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
statute
is,
as
justice
jackson
said
on
another
occasion,
a
teasing
illusion.
it
is
like
a
munificent
bequest
in
a
pauper's
will.
it
promises
everything
and
can
deliver
virtually
nothing.
i
turn
now,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
suppression
issue,
and
it
is
a
melancholy
issue
in
this
case.
what
happened
here
simply
does
not
make
a
very
pretty
picture.
the
unconstitutional
orgy
of
the
way
in
which
this
search
was
executed
and
the
way
in
which
these
seizures
were
made
is
of
mind-boggling
proportion.
we're
not--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--no,
sir,
no.
if
i've
intimated
that,
that
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
what
they
did
here
and
the
manner
they
did
it,
not
the
numbers.
i
can
conceivably
see
where
thousands
are
involved
in
a
criminal
enterprise
and,
if
probable
cause
exists
and
if
the
executing
officers
are
governed
by
the
authority
set
out
in
the
warrant,
by
all
means.
but
what
we're
dealing
here
with
is,
as
the
trial
judge
observed,
they
simply
came
in
and
took
everything
that
they
could
carry
out.
there
was
no
effort
made--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--yes,
it
was
suppressed
because
it
was
irrelevant.
they
seized
love
letters
which
were
irrelevant,
they
seized
report
cards
of
children
which
were
irrelevant,
they
seized
bounced
checks
which
were
irrelevant,
they
seized
credit
applications
which
were
irrelevant.
it
was
suppressed
because
it
was
irrelevant.
it
was
not
suppressed
because
of
the
heinousness,
the
revulsion
that
the
trial
court
felt,
that
it
should
have
felt,
for
what
they
did
and
how
they
did
it.
we're
not
talking
in
this
case
about
the
constable
that
blundered.
we're
talking
about
constables
who
knew
very
well
what
they
were
doing
and
who
embarked
on
a
prearranged
design
and
plan
to
do
precisely
what
they
did
here.
they
testified
that
it
was
their
objective
to
seize
evidence
of
assets
so
that
forfeiture
proceedings
could
be
brought.
there
was
nothing
in
the
four
corners
of
the
warrant
to
authorize
them
to
do
that.
so
indifferent
were
they
to
the
ambit
of
the
warrant
that
they
seized
lock
boxes
where
they
didn't
even
bother
to
distinguish
what
was
or
what
was
not
sizeable.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
does
not
good
to
excite
passions,
but
it's
hard
not
to
be
offended
by
what
was
done
here.
so
long
as
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
and
a
fifth
amendment,
there
must
be
a
point
at
which
this
court
will
say
enough
is
enough.
may
i
respectfully
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
herbert
shafer
if
the
court
please.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
clear
up
one
problem.
i
didn't
mean
to
intimate
to
the
court
that
remand
for
a
fresh
suppression
hearing
would
be
unacceptable.
on
the
contrary.
it
isn't
an
all
or
nothing
proposition
for
guy
waller
and
the
codefendants.
we'd
rather
have
an
incomplete
remedy
than
no
remedy
at
all,
obviously.
mr.
herbert
shafer
we
would
hope
to.
but
realistically
speaking,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
trial
judge
hearing
the
motion
to
suppress
would
be
hard
put
to
change
his
mind,
and
that
is
why
we're
asking
this
court
and
the
constitution
to
make
up
his
mind
for
him
by
ordering
a
new
trial.
mr.
herbert
shafer
that
is
not
before
another
jury,
though,
which
would
be
insulated
as--
mr.
herbert
shafer
--but
the
analogy
i'm
trying
to
draw,
justice
white,
is
jackson
v.
denno
was
sent
back
for
a
new
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
but
that
was
a
jury
that
was
completely
insulated
from
the
events
that
had
happened
previously.
that
would
not
be
the
case
with
a
new
judge.
mr.
herbert
shafer
i'm
confused
on
that.
justice
o'connor
suggested
that
the
statute
could
not
be
properly
addressed
because
everything
that
was
illegally
seized
was
suppressed.
well,
we
really
don't
know
what
was
suppressed,
and
we
really...
or
rather,
we
really
don't
know
that
what
was
suppressed
was
all
that
should
have
been
suppressed,
because
the
trial
court
studiously
refused
to
consider
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
and
refused
to
consider
the
manner
in
which
the
warrant
was
executed.
the
trial
court
simply
said,
i
ain't
going
to
sit
here
for
no
nine
hours
and
listen
to
a
bunch
of
police
officers
come
in
and
say
how
they
executed
the
warrant.
so
whether
they
in
fact
executed
a
general
warrant,
which
would
require
suppression
of
everything,
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
this,
though:
some
of
the
police
officers
who
testified
acknowledged
that
they
conducted
the
searches
and
seizures
under
the
authority
of
the
warrant.
we
do
know
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
that
it
was
properly
before
the
court.
and
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
make
an
evidentiary
showing...
we
were
frustrated
by
the
trial
court...
in
order
to
expand
the
record.
so
minimally,
if
the
court
has
some
doubts
on
the
subject,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
we
ought
to
have
a
new
hearing
on
remand
on
that
question.
finally,
the
suppression
order
entered
by
the
court,
the
trial
court,
was
not
sufficient
because
this
kind
of
indiscriminate
search
and
seizure,
a
general
search
and
seizure,
requires
suppression
of
everything.
the
failure
to
suppress
everything,
but
allowing
them
to
return
those
things
that
they
have
no
use
for,
is
an
insufficient
remedy
under
the
circumstances.
and
finally,
if
the
court
please,
calero-toledo
had
exigent
circumstances.
we
don't
have
any
exigent
circumstances
here.
thank
you.
