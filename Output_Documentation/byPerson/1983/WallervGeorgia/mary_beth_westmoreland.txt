ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
has
pointed
out,
there
are
two
separate
issues
presented
to
the
court,
and
i
will
address
them
in
the
order
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
shafer,
has
presented
them
to
the
court
this
morning.
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
issue
of
the
closure
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
closure
and
the
state's
justification
for
the
closure
of
that
hearing.
the
state
sought
to
close
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
pursuant
to
a
georgia
statute
requiring
that
there
be
no
unnecessary
publication
of
electronic
surveillance
evidence,
similar
to
such
concerns
that
had
been
expressed
under
title
3
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act.
so
that
the
purpose
of
the
closure
was
the
protection
of
the
privacy
of
other
individuals.
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
a
colloquy
took
place
between
the
court
and
counsel
for
all
of
the
petitioners
present.
counsel
for
mr.
cole,
who
is
one
of
the
petitioners
present
in
this
case,
concurred
with
the
request
and
agreed
to
the
closure
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
as
such,
we
would
submit
he
simply
has
no
cause
to
challenge
the
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
shafer
objected
on
behalf
of
his
clients
and
urged
that
his
clients
did
have
a
right
to
a
public
trial.
once
the
court
determined
that
closure
would
be
effected,
mr.
shafer
then
requested
that
certain
specified
individuals
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
courtroom.
at
the
insistence
of
counsel
for
petitioner
cole,
all
of
the
individuals
were
excluded
from
the
courtroom
except
for
necessary
court
personnel,
counsel,
and
the
respective
petitioners
in
the
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
the
suppression
hearing
was
closed
for
the
entire
hearing,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
about
seven
days,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
what
the
record
reflects...
and
i
don't
believe
it's
broken
down
precisely
in
time
increments.
we
have
a
portion
of
the
record,
which
admittedly
is
not
in
relation
to
the
entire
length
of
the
suppression
hearing,
a
portion
of
the
record
which
is
devoted
to
the
playing
of
certain
specific
tapes
of
wiretaps
which
had
been
made.
and
i
don't
know
that
the
record
actually
reflects
precisely
how
long
that
is.
i
believe
it
is
less
than
a
full
day
period.
certain
other
parts--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--it
would
be
hours,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
precisely
how
long.
i
believe
petitioners
have
asserted
two
and
a
half.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
what
we
submit
is
that
the
initial
basis
for
the
request
for
the
motion
was
justified
based
on
the
fact
that
not
only
were
the
tapes
being
played,
but
other
evidence
was
being
presented
throughout
the
entire
hearing.
the
main
thrust
of
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
was
electronic
surveillance.
that
was...
the
majority
of
the
motion
to
suppress
was
devoted
to
the
electronic
surveillance,
the
manner
in
which
it
was
conducted,
the
persons
who
were
surveilled,
and
various
other
things
of
this
aspect.
during
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
there
were
references
to
individuals'
phone
numbers,
other
individuals
who
may
have
had
their
telephones
tapped
during
this
proceeding.
at
the
beginning
of
the
motion
to
suppress,
i
don't
know
that
the
trial
court
knew
precisely
to
what
limits
the
evidence
would
go
during
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
but
we
would
submit
that
there
was
a
justification
at
the
outset
of
that
hearing
for
closing
the
entire
hearing.
and
we
would
also
note
that
there
is
no
attempt
made
at
a
later
portion
to
request
that
the
hearing
be
made
open
at
any
part,
even
after
the
tapes
were
played.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
not
that
i
recall
on
the
record,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
there
was
a
discussion
conducted
as
to
the
transcript
at
that
point
i
believe
it
was
made
available
to
counsel,
and
i
think
the
transcript
has
been
made
available
at
this
time.
it
was
public
once
it
was
submitted
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
i
know
it
was
open
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
i
don't
know
the
status,
at
what
point
in
time.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
for
the
public,
your
honor,
to
my
knowledge.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
the
tapes
were
played
at
the
trial.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
this
is
where
we
would
submit
that
the
trial
court
did
conduct
a
balancing
of
the
interests.
petitioners
have
asserted
that
the
trial
court
balanced
nothing.
a
reading
of
the
transcript,
of
the
particular
portion
on
the
motion
to
suppress
dealing
with
this
issue,
shows
that
the
trial
court
recognized
the
fact
that
if
this
motion
were
made
in
relation
to
the
trial
itself,
then
the
public
trial
right
would
have
to
supersede
any
concerns
of
privacy
or
other
individuals
in
regard
to--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--yes,
sir.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
think
the
state's
interest--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--the
state's
interest
focuses
on
not
only
the
fact...
there
are
persons
who
were
not
being
tried
at
that
point,
who
were
not
indicted,
who
subsequently
i
think
were
tried
or
were
considered
for
trial,
and
the
state
was
seeking
to
protect
their
rights,
at
least
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
recognizing
they
could
not--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
argument
that
i
was
making
before
we
adjourned
for
lunch
was
dealing
with
closure
of
the
trial.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
move
into
some
of
the
factors
that
were
considered
by
the
trial
court
and
what
was
the
basis
for
the
closure.
the
trial
court,
as
i
have
noted
previously,
did
balance
interests
prior
to
the
closure.
he
recognized
that
there
was
a
public
trial
right
and
specifically
acknowledged
that
that
right
would
have
to
take
precedence
if
this
were
addressed
to
the
trial
itself
rather
than
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
trial
court
was
also
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
were
other
persons
potentially
involved.
shortly
prior
to
this
hearing,
continuances
had
been
granted
for
any
number
of
defendants,
and
the
trial
court
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
these
defendants
were
also
involved
and
could
have
been
involved
in
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
to
be
presented
at
the
hearing.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that...
not
just
necessarily
one
individual,
but
in
this
circumstance
we
have
the
potential
of
so
many
individuals
being
affected
and
so
many
individuals'
privacy
rights
being
affected
by
the
very
nature
of
the
crime
that
was
involved,
by
the
very
scope
of
the
gambling
operation
that
took
place,
and
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
factors
that
was--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that
could
be
enough
in
a
given
case,
your
honor.
and
we
would
submit
that
what
has
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
public
trial
guarantee
is
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
any
given
case,
to
determine
whether
that
public
trial
right
must
take
precedence
over
other
privacy
rights
of
individuals
in
the
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
the
obvious
response
is
that
there
was
still
the
potential
for
other
evidence
coming
out,
as
i
have
noted
previously.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
for
instance,
other
individuals'
telephone
numbers,
names,
and
that
type
of
information,
which,
while
not
necessarily
within
the
restrictions
of
the
statute
providing
for
the
publication,
referring
to
the
publication
of
wiretap
evidence,
still
affects
privacy
rights
of
these
individuals.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
not
to
my
recollect,
your
honor.
there
was
no
suggestion
made
by
any
counsel
at
a
later
stage
that
the
proceedings
at
that
time
be
opened.
the
suggestions
were
all
made
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
and
i
don't
recall
seeing
one
at
any
stage
later
in
the
proceedings.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
there
were
no
factual
findings
made
on
the
record
at
the
time
of
the
closure.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
although
i
think
there
was
the
opportunity
there
for
a
hearing
should
anyone
wished
to
present
any
additional
evidence.
the
court
was,
as
i
noted,
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
obviously
a
great
number
of
people
were
involved.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
a
specific
factual
finding
on
the
record
we
would
submit
is
not
essential
to
the
closure
of
the
hearing
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
when
it
is
important...
when
it
is
obvious
from
the
record
that
the
trial
court
did
balance
the
rights.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
would
submit
that
in
that
circumstance
the
prosecution
would
have
to
go
further
than
just
merely
requesting
closure.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
in
the
instance
that
your
honor
suggests,
the
court
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
right
is
available
which
should
take
precedence.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
type
of
proceeding
we're
referring
to.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
under
those
circumstances
that--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--that's
not
necessarily
the
circumstance
in
which
we
would--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--we
would
submit
that
a
suppression
hearing
is
not
such
a
proceeding
to
which
a
public
trial
guarantee
necessarily
attaches.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
one
of
the
positions
that
we
would
take
in
this
court,
your
honor,
and
also
obviously
noting
that
the
privacy
right
is--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--there's
a
possibility--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
such
hearing
conducted.
but
we
would
submit
that
the
assertions
that
were
made
on
the
record
in
this
case
were
sufficient
to
allow
the
judge
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
privacy
right
at
stake
and
to
allow
the
judge
to
balance
that
privacy
right.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
we
simply
do
not
think
that
the
public
trial
right
need
attach
to
a
suppression
hearing,
particularly
not
under
the
facts
of
the
instant
case.
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
public
trial
did
not
attach
and
was
simply
not
violated.
the
fact
that
it
was
a
suppression
hearing
is
a
fact
that
should
be
considered
by
the
court
in
making
its
determination
as
to
whether
a
public
trial
right
was
violated.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
the
jury
had
been
impaneled,
your
honor,
but
we
would
submit
that
that
is
simply
a
procedural
technicality
that
had
taken
place
and
does
not
necessarily
make
the
suppression
hearing
any
more
a
part
of
the
trial
than
it
would
have
if
the
suppression
hearing
had
taken
place
two
months
prior
to
the
actual
trial
itself.
it
was
a
procedural
matter
and
nothing
more,
and
under
those
circumstances
we
would
submit
that
to
apply
a
public
trial
guarantee
to
a
suppression
hearing
would
in
a
sense
defeat
the
entire
purpose
behind
the
suppression
hearing
and
the
exclusionary
rule
itself.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
as
noted
previously,
under
some
circumstances
that
could
be
sufficient,
it
might
be.
in
this
case
we
would
submit
that
at
the
time
this
decision
was
made
that
was
not...
that
was
something
that
would
have
been
purely
speculative
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
there
is
a
transcript
of
the
motion
to
suppress
hearing
and
what
took
place
regarding
the
closure
is
transcribed.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
am
not
certain
as
to
how
soon
afterwards
it
was
actually
made
available
to
the
public.
i
simply
don't
know
that.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
did.
i
just
simply--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
the
transcript
i
believe
was
initially
sealed
in
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
and
i
don't
know
at
what
stage
it
became
opened.
like
i
said,
i
do
know
that
it
was
opened
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
direct
appeal,
and
at
that
time
the
evidence
had
already
been
played
during
the
trial
of
the
case.
so
it
was
opened.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
it
was
made
available
to
counsel,
i
believe,
at
some
point,
your
honor.
i
am
simply
not
certain
as
to
exactly
at
what
stage.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
i
simply
don't
know.
i
would
doubt
it,
because
the
trial
did
begin
almost
immediately
after
the
suppression
hearing
was
concluded.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
can
perceive
none,
your
honor.
the
evidence
was
available.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
whether
through
the
suppression
hearing
transcripts
or
through
the
trial
itself,
the
evidence
was
available,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
assuming
that
the
prosecution
prevailed
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
that's
a
definite
consideration.
the
consideration
is
always
present
in
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
that
you
may
not
prevail,
and
in
order
to
protect
privacy
rights
of
individuals
at
that
point
that
consideration
has
to
come
into
play,
that
this
evidence
may
be
suppressed.
and
once
again,
we
come
to
one
of
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
itself.
we
would
submit
that
this
simply
furthers
that
purpose.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
the
only
remedy
that
would
be
appropriate
or
necessary
assuming
that
we
were
to
lose
on
this
argument
would
be
a
new
suppression
hearing.
that
would
be
sufficient
at
least
until
such
time
as
that
suppression
hearing
was
conducted.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
well,
your
honor,
that
would
be
true
and
would
fall
in
line
with
our
argument
that
there
is
simply
no
need
for
any
such
remedy
in
this
case.
but
we
would
submit
that
that
is
the
most
that
is
required
in
the
fashion
of
a
remedy
at
this
stage.
to
require
an
entire
new
trial--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
perhaps
the
court
would
probably
give
direction
to
the
georgia
court
as
to
what
their
remedy
would
be
in
this
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
they
can
prevail
under
certain
circumstances.
that
is
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
aside
from
also
the
point
that
the
sixth
amendment
public
trial
guarantee
should
not
be
held
to
apply
to
a
motion
to
suppress,
at
least
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
conjunction
with
protecting
the
prosecutions,
you
once
again
necessarily
bring
in
the
privacy
rights,
because
that
is
the
fundamental
purpose
behind
the
statute
prohibiting
publication.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that
is
also
a
compelling
interest
the
state
may
have.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
at
this
point
it
is.
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
it
was
not.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
that
would
be
our
submission
as
well,
is
that
either
a
new
suppression
hearing
would
serve
no
purpose
and
a
new
trial
is
simply
not
warranted
under
the
facts
of
the
case.
there
is
simply
no
showing
that
an
open
suppression
hearing
would
have
affected
the
trial
one
way
or
the
other.
we
have
the
record,
we
have
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trial.
virtually
all
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
at
the
suppression
hearing,
with
the
exception
of
perhaps--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
a
new
suppression
hearing
could
be
a
potential
remedy,
and
we
would
again
submit
that
it's
simply
not
a
necessity,
but
that
would
be
the
most
extreme
remedy
that
would
be
warranted
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
there
is
a
speculation
that
it
might
very
well
be
true.
in
the
instant
case,
however,
we
have
an
open
trial
in
which
virtually
all
witnesses
did
testify
before
the
trial
court
at
that
time.
they
testified
in
public,
with
the
exception
of,
i
believe
i
noted,
i
think
four
or
five
witnesses
who
did
not,
but
who
could
readily
have
been
called
to
testify
at
the
trial
and
present
their
testimony
in
public.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that,
once
again,
the
fact
that
the
trial
itself
was
open
serves
that
purpose
of
a
public
trial
guarantee.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
there
was
a...
if
you
wish
to
categorize
it,
it
was
not
really
a
hearing.
there
was
a
discussion
that
took
place
between
the
trial
court
and
defense
counsel
and
the
district
attorney
prior
to
the
closure.
there
was
no
actual
evidence
taken.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
it
seems
to
me
that
this
circumstance
is
somewhat
different
from
that.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
actually,
although
the
jury
was
impaneled,
it
still
is
actually
a
pre-trial
type
of
proceeding.
the
mere
fact
that
the
jury
may
or
may
not
have
been
selected
prior
to
the
suppression
hearing
is
not
sufficient
to
actually
incorporate
it
into
the
trial.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
there
is
a
first
amendment
argument,
i
think,
that
has
been
somewhat
asserted
by
the
petitioners.
but
we
would
submit
the
first
amendment
question
is
simply
not
brought
before
this
court
in
this
case,
that
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
is
a
sixth
amendment
public
trial
question,
and
that
the
first
amendment--
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
--no,
your
honor,
we
would
not.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
i
think
the
circumstances
are
somewhat
different,
your
honor,
in
the
instant
case.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
differences
that
we
have
between
the
two
cases.
ms.
mary
beth
westmoreland
they
apply,
but
not
to
the
same
extent,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
we
would
submit
that
the
public
trial
right
would
not
apply
to
this
type
of
hearing
in
the
same
light
the
same
type
of
restrictions
might
be
placed
upon
a
first
amendment
type
of
right.
in
the
time
that
i
have
remaining,
i
would
like
to
move
on
to
the
search
and
seizure
issue
that
has
been
presented
to
the
court.
in
beginning,
i
would
note
that,
as
pointed
out
previously
by
justice
o'connor,
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
is
simply
not
a
question
that
is
properly
presented
to
the
court.
there
has
been
no
showing
that
any
evidence
that
was
admitted
at
the
trial
was
not
seized
pursuant
to
the
search
warrants
themselves.
evidence
was
suppressed
which
was
allegedly
seized
outside
the
scope
of
the
search
warrant.
the
petitioners
have
pointed
to
no
evidence
that
was
presented
at
trial
which
was
seized
outside
of
the
scope
of
those
warrants.
so
we
would
urge
the
court
to
simply
decline
to
reach
the
challenge
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
rico
forfeiture
statute.
if
the
court
were
to
reach
the
facial
validity
of
that
statute,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
clearly
valid
on
its
face.
it
sets
forth
specific
requirements
which
clearly
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment.
it
specifically
codifies
various
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
requiring
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
be
authorized
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
state,
that
they
make
a
seizure
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest,
a
search
or
inspection,
that
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
property
is
subject
to
forfeiture,
and
that
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
property
will
be
lost
or
destroyed
if
not
seized.
these
four
requirement
clearly
fall
within
the
purview
of
the
fourth
amendment
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
essentially
codify
fourth
amendment
principles
in
themselves.
the
statute
does
not
give
officers
authority
to
extend
the
bounds
of
the
search
itself.
the
officers
must
be
conducting
a
lawful
search.
it
merely
authorizes
warrantless
seizures
under
certain
specified,
precise
conditions.
we
submit
that
this
is
no
different
from
a
plain
view
type
of
seizure,
which
has
been
allowed
on
prior
occasions.
in
the
same
context,
the
plain
view
seizure
does
not
enlarge
on
the
right
to
actually
search
the
area,
but
simply
recognizes
the
fact
that
once
an
officer
is
in
a
position
to
observe
the
evidence,
to
observe
documents,
then
to
require
that
he
obtain
a
warrant
at
that
point
could
in
some
circumstances
endanger
the
public,
endanger
the
police,
or
could
simply
result
in
the
evidence
being
destroyed
or
lost
before
a
warrant
could
be
obtained,
and
to
require
a
warrant
under
those
circumstances
would
be
an
inconvenience
that
is
simply
not
required
under
fourth
amendment
principles.
petitioners
have
also
made
a
comment
concerning
a
lack
of
notice
and
hearing
provided
in
the
statute,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
itself,
while
not
providing
for
prior
notice
and
hearing,
that
under
the
circumstances
that
a
seizure
would
be
taking
place
that
such
notice
and
hearing
prior
to
seizure
is
simply
not
required.
this
is
similar
to
the
circumstances
found
in
the
calero-toledo
versus
pearson
yacht
leasing
company
case,
in
which
the
circumstances
in
the
case
justified
the
seizure
of
property
without
prior
notice
and
hearing.
the
state's
interest
in
obtaining
in
rem
jurisdiction
over
the
property
and
in
enforcing
criminal
sanctions
and
preventing
the
loss
or
destruction
of
property,
which
quite
obviously
would
be
destroyed
under
those
circumstances,
justifies
the
statutory
provisions
which
do
not
provide
for
the
notice
and
hearing.
the
statute
does
provide
for
a
hearing
within
a
very
short
time
period
thereafter,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
clearly
sufficient
to
meet
the
fourth
amendment
requirements.
finally,
petitioners
assert
that
the
search
in
question
was
a
general
search
and
that
all
evidence
seized
should
have
been
excluded.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
justification
presented
in
this
record
for
extending
the
exclusionary
rule
to
such
unreasonable
bounds
as
to
exclude
every
piece
of
evidence
seized
in
this
case.
the
evidence
would
not
support
a
conclusion
that
the
officers
acted
in
flagrant
disregard
of
the
search
warrant.
the
warrants
were
valid
on
the
face
of
those
warrants,
and
there
is
no
reason
existing
on
this
record
to
exclude
evidence
which
was
clearly
lawfully
seized
pursuant
to
the
warrant.
to
do
so
would
be
to
defeat
the
entire
purpose
behind
the
exclusionary
rule
and
would
serve
no
deterrent
effect
on
the
actions
of
police
officers.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
the
court
should
not
find
a
general
search
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
they
simply
do
not
warrant
such
a
conclusion.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
would
simply
urge
that
the
court
conclude
that
there
was
no
public
trial
right
that
attached,
and
even
if
the
public
trial
right
did
attach
at
a
suppression
hearing
it
was
not
violated
under
the
facts
of
the
instant
case.
we
would
also
urge
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
statute
providing
for
the
rico
forfeitures
was
not
presented
to
this
court,
as
all
evidence
submitted
at
trial
was
seized
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant.
even
so,
the
statute
is
clearly
valid
on
its
face
and
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
justify
a
finding
that
there
was
a
general
search.
thank
you,
your
honors.
