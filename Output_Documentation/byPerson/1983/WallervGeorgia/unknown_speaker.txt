unknown
speaker
does
your
argument
extend
to
the
suppression
hearings
conducted
previous
to
the
impaneling
of
the
jury,
as
well
as
to
a
suppression
hearing
conducted
after
the
jury
was
impaneled?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shafer,
supposing
that
you
had
a
suppression
motion
well
in
advance
of
trial,
but
it's
closed
by
the
court.
the
court
refuses
to
suppress
the
evidence,
it
is
then
admitted
at
the
trial,
which
is
perfectly
open.
under
your
theory,
the
closure
of
the
motion
hearing
would
have
violated
the
defendant's
right
to
a
public
trial.
what
would
be
the
remedy
for
that
violation?
unknown
speaker
nothing
short
of
that?
unknown
speaker
are
you
positive
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
took
the
justice's
hypothetical
to
say
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
trial,
the
trial
was
open
all
the
way.
why
wouldn't
you
have
a
suppression
hearing
repeated,
and
wouldn't
that
be
enough
by
way
of
remedy?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
that
the
hypothetical
given
by
justice
rehnquist
was
to
the
effect
that
the
trial
was
perfectly
open,
the
trial
itself.
and
why
do
you
have
to
have
a
new
trial
then?
wouldn't
a
new
suppression
hearing,
so
to
speak,
be
a
sufficient
remedy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shafer,
may
i
throw
this
out
at
you
on
that
very
point.
supposing
they
suppress
the
evidence
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
was
closed.
would
you
still
think
you're
entitled
to
a
new
trial?
you
get
all
the
relief
you
asked
for
in
the
suppression
hearing
except
having
it
open.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
your
answer
is
you'd
say
the
same
result?
unknown
speaker
if
you
carry
your
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion
based
on
the
affront
to
the
system,
then
even
if
your
client
were
acquitted
you
must
be
pressing
for
a
new
trial
to
vindicate
the
affront
to
the
system.
unknown
speaker
you
might
if
he
waived
the
double
jeopardy,
you
might.
unknown
speaker
well,
realistically
you
wouldn't
want
a
new
trial
then,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
will
you
please
tell
me
what
provision
of
the
constitution
gives
you
remedies
for
your
discomfiture?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shafer,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
question
on
the
statute
is
properly
here.
as
i
understand
it,
all
the
property
seized
which
was
not
covered
by
warrants
was
suppressed.
so
we
don't
have
any
of
that
property
in
this
case,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
now,
yes
or
no?
wasn't
the
property
suppressed,
the
evidence
was
suppressed
as
to
all
property
seized
except
that
covered
by
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
we
know
what
property
was
suppressed
and
what
wasn't?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
your
last
argument,
but
i'm
trying
to
see
whether
this
statutory
question
is
even
properly
here.
unknown
speaker
what
county
in
georgia
was
this
tried?
unknown
speaker
right
in
atlanta.
unknown
speaker
right
in
atlanta,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
not
properly
before
the
court
then
it
simply
means
that
you
haven't
preserved
it
to
bring
it
to
our
attention.
we
wouldn't
do
anything
with
it
if
it
weren't
properly
before
the
court.
we
wouldn't
remand.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
there's
something
inherently
wrong
with
trying
to
search
and
seize
in
200
or
500
or
1,000
places
at
once
if
they
have
the
information?
is
that
what
makes
it
an
orgy,
the
numbers?
unknown
speaker
but
some
of
it
was
suppressed,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
would
you
refresh
my
recollection.
how
long
was
the
trial...
was
the
suppression
hearing
closed?
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
that?
unknown
speaker
seven
days.
does
the
record
show
how
much
of
the
suppression
hearing
actually
related
to
the
confidential
information
that
prompted
the
closing?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
hours
or
days?
unknown
speaker
hours?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
contend
it
should
have
remained
closed
during
periods
when
that
type
of
evidence
was
not
being
introduced?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
renewal
of
the
request?
unknown
speaker
at
the
end
of
the
seven
days,
the
judge
did
release
some
of
it,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
by
the
time
it
reached
the
georgia
supreme
court
it
was
public?
unknown
speaker
open
for
the
court
or
for
the
public
generally?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
tapes
were
played
at
the
trial,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
all
going
to
be
made
public
there,
regardless
of
their
impact
on
other
people.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state's
interest
in
closing
it,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
would
only
be
to
protect
privacy
in
the
event
you
lost
your
motion.
if
the
motion
to
suppress
were
granted,
you
would
have
lost
and
what
would
have
been
your
interest
then?
certainly
if
you
win
and
you
plan
to
introduce
the
tapes
at
the
trial--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
don't
plan
to
protect
anybody's
privacy.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
state's
interest
in
closing
the
suppression
hearing?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
if
anyone
else
is
involved
or
affected,
that
that
is
sufficient
in
itself
to
close
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
enough
if
just
one
person's
rights
are
affected?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
westmoreland,
was
there
any
reason
that
the
proceeding
could
not
have
been
open
after
the
tapes
were
played?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
was
any
suggestion
made
during
the
proceeding
that
it
should
be
opened
at
some
later
stage?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
this
mostly
speculation,
though,
about
what
invasions
of
privacy
might
occur?
were
there
any
findings
by
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
or
off
the
record,
based
on
an
off
the
record
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
part
of
your
submission,
then,
is
that
these
kinds
of
findings
are
not
essential
to
close?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
you
say
if
at
any
suppression
hearing
the
prosecution
just
got
up
and
said,
your
honor,
we'd
like
to
close
this
hearing,
and
he
said
fine?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
what
right
is
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
mean
there
would
be
some
federal
constitutional
obligation
to
keep
the
hearing
open?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
just
a
suppression
hearing,
and
the
prosecution
says:
your
honor,
we
think
it'd
be
better
to
close
this
hearing.
unknown
speaker
that
infringes
the
defendant's
right
to
a
public
trial,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
would
that
violate
the
defendant's
rights,
without
some
kind
of
findings?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
just
take
that
position,
then,
and
forget
this
privacy
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
lost
on
that,
though.
suppose
the
issue
was,
suppose
it
was
clear
that
in
my
example
the
defendant's
right
to
a
public
trial
would
be
infringed
absent...
without
more.
how
much
more
would
there
have
to
be?
just
some
inference
of
third
party
interests,
or
wouldn't
he
have
to
make
some
findings?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
the
prosecution
have
to...
perhaps
you
could
have
an
in
camera
hearing
and
the
judge
could
be
told
what
was
really
involved
in
this
suppression
hearing.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
have
that
here,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
although
you
don't
think
even
that
kind
of
a
consideration
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
here
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
and
perhaps
it
was
a
part
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
does
that
follow?
supposing
you
did
what
i
think
perhaps
was
behind
some
of
justice
powell's
questioning
this
morning,
supposing
you
closed
everything
except
the...
i
mean,
suppose
you
did
not
permit
the
wiretaps
themselves
to
become
public,
but
just
all
the
evidence
about
how
they
were
taken
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
why
wouldn't
that
be
adequate
for
the
state's
interest?
unknown
speaker
is
the
transcript
available
of
what
actually
happened
at
this
hearing?
do
we
have
it
in
the
papers
before
us?
unknown
speaker
the
entire
transcript
of
the
suppression
hearing
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
how
soon
after
the
close
of
the
suppression
hearing
was
that
transcript
available
to
the
public,
to
the
press,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
it
became
available
at
some
point,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
it
ever
become
available
before
you
actually
but
the
evidence,
played
the
tapes
at
the
trial?
did
the
prosecution
just
revoke
its
objections
to
making
this
matter
public?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
opened
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean...
i
thought
it
was
opened
before
trial,
wasn't
it?
it
wasn't?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
it
was
made
public
before
the
actual
playing
of
the
tapes
at
trial?
unknown
speaker
once
the
tapes
were
available
and
played
in
the
courtroom,
there'd
be
certainly
no
reason
to
withhold
the
transcript,
would
there?
unknown
speaker
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
by
that
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
and
this
trial
was
going
to
go
on
just
instantaneously
after
the
suppression
hearing,
and
you
knew
you
were
going
to
play
the
tapes,
i
don't
know
what
interest
the
prosecution
really
had
in
closing
the
hearing.
the
cat's
going
to
be
out
of
the
bag
in
a
few
days
anyway.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
lose
on
this
argument.
what's
the
remedy
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
can
we
just
have...
can
the
state
just
conduct
a
new
suppression
hearing
and
open
it
up?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
really
ludicrous
in
a
way,
to
say
that
you
conduct
a
new
suppression
hearing
where
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
absence
of
the
public
influenced
a
decision,
which
is
purely
a
question
of
law,
as
to
whether
evidence
should
be
suppressed
or
not.
i
realize
it's
not
you
that
say
that
there
has
to
be
some
remedy,
but
to
have
a
new
suppression
hearing
just
seems
like
giving
someone
a
wooden
arm
when
they
don't
need
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
we
have
to
determine
what
the
remedy
is?
isn't
that
a
matter
for
the
georgia
courts
if
you
should
not
prevail
here?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
a
little
troubled.
i
take
it
your
basic
argument
is
that
the
theoretical
privacy
rights
of
third
parties
prevail
over
a
constitutional
right
of
a
defendant
who
is
accused
and
being
tried
to
a
public
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
one
of
the
interests
you
were
asserting
was
the
interest
of
the
state,
wholly
aside
from
third
parties,
to
protect
your
law
enforcement
function,
other
prosecutions
and
things
like
that,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
might
want
to
protect
some
informers
who
might
be
revealed
or
surfaced
in
these
things.
unknown
speaker
in
which
event
i
doubt
that
you
would
play
the
tapes
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
i
still
don't
understand
how
you
have
a
hearing,
a
suppression
hearing,
and
reveal
what
has
already
been
revealed.
i
assume
you
put
in
the
same
testimony
that
is
not
only
in
the
record,
but
it's
all
the
way
up
here
now.
so
it's
rather
public.
unknown
speaker
but
i
still,
like
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
see
actually
what
anybody
gets
out
of
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
effect
does
that...
was
it
jackson
or
something
against
new
york,
where
this
court
said
you
should
hold
a
confession
hearing,
jackson
against
denno?
yes.
does
that
have
any
effect
on
this?
unknown
speaker
jackson
and
denno
says,
where
there
was
a
charge
that
the
confession
was
illegally
admitted
into
evidence...
despite
the
conviction,
this
court
sent
it
back
to
have
a
hearing
on
it--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
whether
the
confession
was
admissible
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
the
basis
of
that
could
you
send
this
case
hack
for
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
suppressed
evidence
should
not
have
been
suppressed?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
thought
behind
the
public
trial.
i'm
sure
that
it
may
actually
have
some
impact
on
the
outcome.
witnesses
sometimes
testify
differently
in
a
closed
hearing
than
they
would
in
public.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
them
may
not
testify
at
all
if
it's
an
open
hearing.
so
it
may
be
that
the
result
would
be
different
in
an
open
hearing.
unknown
speaker
public
trials,
also
sometimes
people
read
about
them,
see
about
them;
all
of
a
sudden
somebody
shows
up,
i'm
the
unknown,
as
a
witness,
that
completely
refutes
the
state's
case.
unknown
speaker
ms.
westmoreland,
i
gather
that
before
the
closure
was
ordered
there
was
no
proceeding
to
identify
any
state
interest,
compelling
or
otherwise,
and
any
weighing
proceeding
of
any
kind
by
the
judge.
he
just
ordered
the
closure,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
is
that
consistent
with
what
we
said,
at
least
in
the
context
of
that
case,
in
globe
newspaper
about
the
necessity
before
closure
of
a
proceeding
of
this
kind,
in
which
the
state
interest
is
identified
and
the
judge
can
weigh
it
and
all
that?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
a
pre-trial
question
or
what?
no,
this
was
suppression
during
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
this
is
primarily
a
sixth
amendment
case.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
also
a
first
amendment
argument
here,
i
think,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
had
been
phrased,
framed
as
a
first
amendment
issue,
would
you
have
a
different
position
than
the
one
you
are
advocating
today?
unknown
speaker
that's
my
point.
and
globe
was
a
first
amendment
case.
unknown
speaker
a
true
first
amendment
case.
unknown
speaker
and
why
shouldn't
what
we
said
there
apply
equally
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
different
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
motion
to
suppress
and
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
witness.
unknown
speaker
but
the
underlying
reasons
for
requiring
access
and
open
trials,
don't
they
apply
to
both,
both
to
the
context
of
the
witness
that
we
had
in
globe
and
the
suppression
hearing?
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
after
your
new
hearing
on
suppression?
go
to
another
trial
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
the
hearing
might
be
before
another
judge.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
suppression
hearing
isn't
going
to
be
before
a
jury.
it's
going
to
be
before
a
judge.
unknown
speaker
in
jackson
against
denno
the
hearing
that
was
going
to
take
place
on
remand
wasn't
before
a
jury.
it
was
before
a
judge.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
jury.
the
only
question
on
that
remand
was
whether
it
would
ever
get
to
the
jury.
and
if
it
was
found
to
be
voluntary,
it
was
properly
put
before
the
jury.
