mr.
james
l.
messenger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justices
of
the
united
states
supreme
court,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court
petitioner
who
claims
that
she
has
had
her
contract
rights
violated
and
files
a
law
suit
in
state
court
to
get
her
job
back,
and
also
alleges
conspiracy
among
the
board
members
to
deprive
her
of
her
job,
that
once
having
tried
that
lawsuit,
can
then
embark
upon
a
second
lawsuit
in
federal
court
alleging
essentially
the
same
facts,
the
came
causes
of
action,
but
tacking
onto
it
a
first
amendment
or
1983
claim.
both
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
felt
that
she
should
not,
and
that
the
preclusive
effect
of
res
judicata
barred
the
second
lawsuit
that
was
filed
in
federal
court.
the
u.s.
district
court
in
ohio
applied
1738,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
which
essentially
requires
that
federal
courts
give
preclusive
effect
to
state
court
judgments
if
in
fact
they
would
be
a
bar
in
federal
court.
we
believe
that
both
lower
federal
courts
were
right,
and
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
opinions
below.
both
the
state
court
action,
your
honors,
and
the
federal
court
action
spawned
from
the
same
set
of
facts.
the
petitioner
had
her
job
abolished.
the
reason
her
job
was
abolished
was
that
at
this
time
in
northern
ohio,
in
youngstown
and
warren,
we
saw
the
loss
of
25,000
or
30,000
jobs
in
a
two-year
period
of
time.
all
of
our
schools
had
to
cut
back
on
personnel.
at
this
time,
we
had
one
of
the
finest
school
systems
in
ohio,
but
jobs
like
dr.
migra
had,
which
was
a
supervisor
of
elementary
education,
had
to
go
by
the
wayside,
because
they
were
a
luxury.
dr.
migra
was
well
respected
and
well
liked
in
the
warren
community.
an
effort
was
found
to
keep
her
in
the
school
system,
but
there
was
no
place
for
her.
simply
because
of
economic,
financial
reasons,
her
job
had
to
be
abolished.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
only
in
the
complaint,
but
also
in
the
answer
filed
both
by
the
board
and
by
the
individual
defendants.
dr.
migra
sued
in
state
court
to
get
her
job
back,
alleging
a
procedural
difficulty
at
the
board
meeting
in
which
her
non-renewal
took
place.
she
was
right,
and
she
won.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
she
was
reinstated,
and
with
back
pay,
and
from
that,
your
honor,
we
appealed
to
the
appellate
court
and
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
and
the
procedural
difficulty
that
the
board
encountered
was
basically
held
to
be
too
bad.
you
didn't
do
it
right,
the
woman
is
entitled
to
her
job
back,
and
back
pay,
and
in
fact
she
was
paid
back
pay.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
just
for
that
one
year.
the
following
year,
your
honor,
she
was
non-renewed
pursuant
to
the
procedures
and
the
statute,
and
that
was
not
contested
in
the
state
court
posture.
she
won
her
case.
essentially,
she
alleged
five
causes
of
action,
one
of
which
was
the
board
violated
the
sunshine
law.
they
anticipatorily
breached
a
contract
and
did
other
things
that
were
procedurally
wrong
in
the
non-renewal
of
a
public
employee's
contract.
at
this
time,
she
had
the
full
opportunity
to
allege
any
other
types
of
claims
that
she
may
have.
she
did
allege
conspiracy
to
deprive
her
of
her
contractual
rights.
she
could
have
alleged
at
that
time
a
1983
action,
a
title
7
action,
a
title
9
action,
or
if
she
wanted,
even
an
age
discrimination
action,
because
dr.
migra
was
into
her
fifties
at
this
time,
and
certainly
an
argument
could
be
made
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
her
position
of
employment
was
removed
was
because
of
age.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
that's
correct.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
claims
that
they
alleged,
that
she
alleged
in
the
state
court
was
conspiracy
to
violate
contract
rights.
being
dismissed
without
prejudice
could
have,
under
ohio's
saving
statute,
been
refiled
within
a
one-year
period
of
time,
but
she
could
not
use
the
cause
of
action
on
conspiracy
to
deprive
of
contract
rights
to
then
open
up
the
entire
spectrum
of
any
other
cause
of
action
that
she
had
neglected
to
file
in
the
first
place.
essentially
what
we
are
talking
about
are
policy
reasons
as
to
why
the
lower
court
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
it
is
certainly
within
the
judicial
process
to
keep
all
of
our
claims
and
all
of
our
cause
of
action
in
one
place.
this
is
not
only,
i
believe,
the
feeling
of
the
ohio
state
courts,
but
also
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
yes,
your
honor,
same
transaction,
the
same
causative
effect,
in
this
instance,
the
non-renewal
of
a
contract
of
employment.
from
this
springs
the
rights
that
the
plaintiff
claimed
were
violated.
she
may
allege
one
or
all
of
the
rights
that
she
claims
were
violated
in
the
state
court
action.
we
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
1983
actions
in
state
courts.
she
could
have
alleged
anything
that
she
wanted
in
that
lawsuit.
she
didn't
miss
much,
i
might
say,
because
there
were
five
particular
causes
of
action
that
were
filed
as
to
why
she
was
entitled
to
get
her
job
back.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
look
at
ohio
law,
the
federal
courts
must
look
at
ohio
law
to
determine
whether
if
the
case
were
in
the
state
court--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
i
didn't
follow
the
question.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
yes.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
think
they
should
follow
the
ohio
law
and
allow
the
suit
in.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
think
they
have
to
look
at
the
state
law.
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
law
on
res
judicata,
whether
or
not
that
state
court--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--the...
on
page
23
of
the
petition,
where
the
lower
court
begins
the
discussion
on
res
judicata
and
why
it
acts
as
a
bar.
it
continues
on
pages
24
and
25,
and
there
is
a
number
of
string
cites
there,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--and
it
basically
comes
to
the
conclusion
that...
and
cites
allen
versus
mccurry
also
of
this
court
that
1983
actions
are
subject
to
the
defense
of
res
judicata,
and
that
under
the
coogan
versus
cincinnati
bar
association,
that
if--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
believe
that's
what
the
whole
opinion
is
about.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
you
mean
specifically
using--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--they
have
federal--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--well,
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
the
federal
courts
would--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
the
federal
courts
would
look
at
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
courts
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
res
judicata
applies.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
of
res
judicata?
well--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
think
i
would
have
to
argue
that
that
is
so,
that
it
is,
but
it
seems
that
the
cases
appear
to
state
that
the
federal
court
will
look
to
what
the
state
law
does
on
a
particular
matter
such
as
res
judicata
and
then
use
that
to
fashion
its
remedy,
but
i
would
certainly
think,
like
in
the
field
of
labor
law,
that
the
federal
courts
could
fashion
their
own
body
of
law
and
their
own
system
of
whether
or
not
res
judicata
in
fact
would
apply,
but
i
believe
this
would
only
amplify
our
position,
that
if
the
state
court
would
have--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--right.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
my
understanding
of
allen
and
mccurry,
your
honor,
was
that
this
court
stated
that
res
judicata
principles
apply
in
1983
actions,
that
prior
to
that
time
the
argument
was
that
only
issue
preclusion
or
collateral
estoppel
applied,
but
the
claim
preclusion
or
res
judicata
might
not
apply.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
from
memory
whether...
whether
it
was,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
guess
at
it,
but
at
least
the
holding
of
it
seemed
to
say
in
our
research
when
we
were
preparing
for
this
case
was
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
does
apply
in
1983
actions,
and
in
fact
the
petitioner
has
admitted
that
in
its
reply
brief,
that
it
applies.
so
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
in
fact
it
is
acknowledged
that
1983
actions...
or
res
judicata
applies
to
1983
actions,
then
certainly
it
should
apply
in
this
case,
because
this
was
a
1983
action
that
was
filed
in
the
federal
courts
in
ohio.
if
it
does
apply,
then
it
bars
the
petitioner's
claim
in
this
particular
lawsuit,
and
the
lower
courts
were
in
fact
dead
right
in
dismissing
the
case.
i
think
there
is
another
policy--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--no,
we
haven't.
we
have
rested
entirely
on
the
ohio--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
believe
that
the
lower
court,
and
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
postulate
for
the
court,
but
i
believe
that
the
district
court
looked
at
what
the
law
of
ohio
was,
the
substantive
law
of
ohio--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
realize
that.
they
cite
the
federal
cases,
and
the
coogan
versus
cincinnati
case.
and
i
do
realize
that
our
brief
was
structured
along
the
lines
of
the
state
law
barring
the
present
suit.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
well,
that
is
certainly
an
argument,
your
honor,
but
to
expand
on
that,
and
as
chief
justice
burger
said,
why
couldn't
the
federal
law...
federal
courts
have
their
own
doctrine
of
res
judicata
that
may
be
even
more
strict
than
the
state?
mr.
james
l.
messenger
but
certainly
if
it
were
barred
under
applying
state
law,
they
would
even
be
more
barred
than
under
federal
law,
so
that--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--right.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
i
believe
that
our
local
courts
are
perfectly
able
to
determine
questions
that
arise
under--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--i
don't
believe
that's
entirely
so,
your
honor.
because
of
the
allegations
contained
in
the
federal
complaint,
they
basically
rehash
the
same
causes
of
action
that
were
brought
in
the
state
court
regarding
the
procedural
deficiencies
and
the
non-renewal,
the
violation
of
the
contract
rights.
the
only
thing
different
in
the
federal
court
is
the
first
amendment
claim,
the
constitutional
claim,
and
our
case
is
simply,
they
could
have
alleged
that
in
trumbull
county
common
pleas
court.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
and
that
judge
there
could
have
decided
that
case,
that
issue,
but
for
some
reason
they
neglected
to
do
that,
and
then
have
filed
another
claim
in
federal
court
alleging
essentially
the
same
thing,
emanating
from
the
same
facts,
the
non-renewal
of
a
contract,
but
this
time
alleging
1983
rights.
that
is
why
the
doctrine,
i
believe,
of
res
judicata,
is
even
present
in
our
legal
system.
it
is
to
stop
doing
what
the
petitioner
has
done.
if
that
doctrine
is
not
applied
to
this
case,
what
would
prevent
the
petitioner
from
filing
an
adea
claim
in
another
district
court,
or
a
title
9
or
a
title
7
claim
in
yet
another
district
court?
we
could
hopscotch
through
the
state
and
the
federal
forums,
depending
upon
the
whims
of
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
i
think
that
the
public
policy
arguments
dictate
that
there
be
an
end
to
litigation,
or
certainly
a
streamlining
to
litigation,
that
we
are
not
saying
to
dr.
migra
that
you
don't
have
a
number
of
causes
of
action
or
a
number
of
claims
to
allege,
but
if
you
have
them,
put
them
all
in
one
place.
be
fair
to
both
sides.
fairness
applies
not
only
to
petitioners
and
plaintiffs,
but
also
to
respondents
and
defendants.
mr.
james
l.
messenger
i
think
essentially
that's
what
he
said,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
have
to
evoke
the
doctrine
of
fairness
to
defendants,
too.
we
didn't
know
that
we
had
to
prepare
a
defense
for
a
1983
claim
or
a
constitutional
right
claim
until
approximately
14
and
a
half
months
after
the
first
claim
was
brought.
now,
this
puts
the
defendant
at
a
disadvantage.
we
now
have
to
begin--
mr.
james
l.
messenger
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
but
it
would
certainly
streamline
the
judicial
system,
and
also
for
the
element
of
fairness
to
put,
if
you
will,
all
your
eggs
in
one
basket,
or
all
your
claims
in
one
court,
but
don't
subject
defendants
to
defending
cases
in
various
courts
depending
upon
the
theory
of
the
case
when
the
local
courts
have
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
these
very
issues.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
anything
else
i
might
add
would
just
be
repetitive.
i
believe
that
the
issue
is
clear.
we
believe
that
the
lower
court
was
absolutely
right
in
applying
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
both
lower
courts,
that
dr.
migra
could
have,
if
she
had
wished,
alleged
her
1983
action
in
the
state
court,
that
she
didn't
do
it,
the
doctrine
of
res
bars
the
instant
action,
and
that
the
lower
court
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
