unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
doctrine
of
state
law
that
you
are--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
vintilla,
i
guess
there
is
no
question
but
that
your
client
could
have
raised
these
claims
in
the
state
court
proceeding,
could
have
filed
the
1983
and
1985
claims
there?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
agree
that
if
under
ohio
law
your
client
would
thereafter
be
precluded
because
she
had
not
brought
them,
that
that
would
be
binding
on
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
clear
requirement
that
federal
courts
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
state
court
judgments?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
our
decision
in
allen
against
mccurry?
unknown
speaker
well,
allen
against
mccurry
and,
i
think,
herring
against
proceze
last
year,
too,
involved...
the
original
state
adjudication
was
a
criminal
one,
wasn't
it,
where
certainly
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
couldn't
be
called
voluntary.
unknown
speaker
did
justice
marshall
at
any
time
say
you
could
go
to
both
courts?
unknown
speaker
did
justice
marshall
say
at
any
time
that
the
statute
gives
you
the
right
to
go
to
both
courts
on
the
same
point?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
so.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
to
the
extent
that
you're...
i
think
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
you
were
making
two
points:
one,
that
the
ohio
law
of
res
judicata
would
not
bar
relitigation
of
your
client's
claim--
unknown
speaker
--and
two,
that
even
if
it
did,
the
federal
statute
would
prevent
it
from
having
that
effect.
now,
so
far
as
the
ohio
law
of
res
judicata
is
concerned,
judge
manos
wrote
an
opinion...
he
is
an
ohio
federal
judge.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
it.
are
you
asking
us
to
disagree
with
their
conclusions
as
to
what
ohio
law
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
district
court...
did
the
district
court
decide
that
further
litigation
in
the
ohio
courts
would
have
been
barred?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
instead
of
filing
this
1983
suit
in
the
federal
court,
the
plaintiff
had
gone
back
to
the
state
court
and
filed
a
1983
suit,
a
separate
1983
suit.
did
the
district
court
decide
that
under
ohio
law
that
suit
would
be
barred
by
res
judicata?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
even
address
what
ohio
law
would
do,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
affirmed
by
order?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vintilla,
how
do
you
explain
the
comment
in
justice...
or,
rather,
judge
manos's
opinion
at
c-29
of
the
petition
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
brought
her
first
amendment
claim
in
state
court,
and
she
is
therefore
barred
from
asserting
it
here,
citing
coogan
against
cincinnati,
which
was
a
fourth...
rather,
a
sixth
circuit
case
that
came
out
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
district
court
had
addressed
state
law
expressly,
and
said
that
any
subsequent
litigation
about
a
claim
you
could
have
raised
but
you
didn't,
any
subsequent
litigation
in
the
state
court
would
have
been
barred
by
state
law.
suppose
that...
or
would
not
have
been
barred.
would
not
have
been
barred.
would
that
preclude
the
federal
court
from
saying,
well,
the
state
courts
might
have
heard
this,
but
we
don't
have
to?
we
must
give
as
much
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
judgment
as
the
state
courts
would,
but
we
can't
give
any
less,
but
we
can
give
more.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
federal
court
just
says,
we
couldn't
care
less
what
the
state
courts
would
do,
we
are
going
to...
we
are
going
to
give
full
faith
and...
we
are
going
to
apply
res
judicata
independently
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
will
you
point
to
the
record
for
what
you
are
now
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
would
you
point
to
the
record
for
what
you
are
now
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
the
judge
wouldn't
be
elected
or
something?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
sure
we
are
interested
in
your
conclusions?
unknown
speaker
or
are
we
interested
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
i,
for
one,
am
interested
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
i,
for
one,
am
interested
in
the
record,
what
the
record
shows.
unknown
speaker
is
this
all
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
she
was
reinstated
and
got
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
for
that
year.
just
for
that
year.
unknown
speaker
mr.
messenger,
now,
her
conspiracy
claim
was
ultimately
dismissed
without
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
effect
of
that?
did
that
incorporate
any
portion
of
her
civil
rights
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
those
claims
arising
out
of
the
same
operative
set
of
facts?
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
an
argument
about
what
federal
res
judicata
principles
should
consist
of?
or
are
you
saying...
or
are
you
arguing
about
ohio
law?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
ohio
law
wouldn't
bar
it
at
all?
do
you
think
the
united
states
district
court
would
have
to
entertain
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
ohio
law,
under
ohio
law
this
plaintiff
would
not
be
barred
from
relitigating
in...
and
from
filing
a
1983
suit
in
the
state
court
after
this
first
judgment.
unknown
speaker
assume
that
it
was
not
barred
by
ohio
law.
do
you
think
the
united
states
supreme...
or
the
united
states
district
court
would
have
to
entertain
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
either
way,
whether
it
is
barred
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
did...
tell
me,
where
did
the
district
court
consider
ohio
law
and
the
effect
of
1738?
did
it
even
cite
1738?
i'm
not
sure
it
did.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
where
is
it...
does
it
ever
cite
1738?
or
consider
what
the
ohio
courts
would
do
with
respect
to
res
judicata?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
never
says
so.
unknown
speaker
i
figure
you
can
just
as
well
interpret
it
as
an
independent
res
judicata
policy
announced
by
the
federal
court,
and
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
1738
doesn't
on
its
face
prevent
the
federal
court
from
applying
a
stricter
rule
of
res
judicata
than
the
state
courts
would.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would,
i
suppose,
i
would
think
you
would
take
that
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
one
didn't.
this
one
didn't.
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
are
confessing
error.
if
a
federal
court
must
address
ohio
law
in
1738
and
didn't,
it
must
have
made
a
mistake.
i
am
suggesting
that
regardless
of
what
state
law
would
do,
the
federal
court
can
impose
its
own
stricter
rule
of
res
judicata.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
inherent
in
the
authority
of
the
federal
court
with
respect
to
its
own
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
it
couldn't
give
any
less
effect
than
the
state
law.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
what
the
court
did
in
allen
against
mccurry?
unknown
speaker
but
did
it
apply
a
federal
rule
of
res
judicata
or
a
virginia
rule?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
oversimplifying
it?
you
say
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
applies,
but
there
are
different
doctrines
of
res
judicata.
there
could
be
one
that
requires
that
the
issue
be
raised
in
the
other
case
and
one
that
does
not.
i
mean,
your
example
in
your
own
case
of
a
property
damage
claim
and
a
personal
injury
claim
arising
out
of
the
same
accident,
one
could
have
different
rules
on
that,
and
you
have
said
the
rule
in
ohio
is
clear,
and
therefore
the
case
is
barred.
you
have
not
even
argued,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
that
there
is
a
federal
rule
that
is
more
strict
than
the
ohio
rule.
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
statute
applies,
and
you
win
on
ohio
law,
but
justice
white,
it
seems
to
me,
is
correct
in
saying
the
lower
court
didn't
really
decide
the
ohio
law
question,
though,
or
do
you
take
issue
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't
cite
a
single
ohio
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
had...
i
would
think
that
if
state
law
is
critical
to
this
case,
and
the
district
court
didn't
decide
it,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals,
that
we
would
have
to
remand.
we
don't
normally
decide
state
law
questions
in
the
first
instance.
but
it
didn't
sound
to
me
like
the
district
court,
as
long
as
it
was
going
to
hold
res
judicata
applied,
apparently
didn't
feel
bound
by
state
law.
it
was
just
a
federal
policy.
unknown
speaker
i
am
suggesting
that
is
what
the
district
court
thought,
and
did.
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
to...
under
1738,
you
would
have
to
hold
it
barred
then.
unknown
speaker
your
friend's
central
thesis
of
his
argument,
as
i
got
it,
was
that
he
was
appealing
to
federal
law,
not
state
law,
when
he
got
into
the
federal
courts.
therefore,
federal
law
should
take
over
with
respect
to
all
the
issues,
should
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
have
been
in
the
local
courts.
you
have
finished
in
the
local
courts.
now
he
has
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
courts,
in
which
no
state
law
question
is
raised,
but
only
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
could.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
district
judge
said,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
ordinarily
a
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
mean,
you
are
protected
against
that
sort
of
thing
not
by
doctrines
of
res
judicata,
but
by
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
before
us
any
more.
you
prevailed
on
that
issue,
didn't
you?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
simple
contract
matter.
unknown
speaker
they
arise...
they
all
arise
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts,
do
they
not?
