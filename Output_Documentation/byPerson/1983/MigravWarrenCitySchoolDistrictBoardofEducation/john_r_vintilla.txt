mr.
john
r.
vintilla
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
civil
rights
action
brought
under
sections
1983
and
85,
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
res
judicata
principles
barred
the
petitioner
from
presenting
her
constitutional
claims
in
the
district
court
because
she
failed
to
raise
them
in
a
prior
state
court
proceeding.
the
central
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
litigation
of
statutory
issues
in
a
state
court
precludes
a
party
from
pursuing
her
federal
civil
rights
claims
which
were
not
raised,
litigated,
or
decided
in
the
prior
stats
court
litigation.
this
central
question
gives
rise
to
two,
we
believe,
two
subsidiary
questions.
first,
does
the
ohio
rule
of
res
judicata
bar
the
petitioner
from
pursuing
the
instant
action
in
the
federal
court,
and
secondly,
should
a
federal
court,
consistent
with
the
congressional
policy
underlying
1983,
deny
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
a
federal
forum
because
he
or
she
litigated,
and
incidentally
prevailed,
on
a
narrow
state
issue
in
a
state
court
against
the
same
parties.
the
factual
history
or
posture
of
this
case,
we
believe,
is
critical
to
a
consideration
and
determination
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
the
petitioner,
ethel
migra,
was
employed
by
the
warren
city
school
district
board
of
education
as
a
supervisor
of
elementary
education.
she
was
employed
on
a
yearly
basis,
what
is
designated
in
ohio
as
a
limited
contract.
in
ohio,
a
state
board
of
education
is,
i
imagine,
in
most
jurisdictions,
is
granted
very
broad
discretion
in
the
renewal
or
non-renewal
of
a
teacher.
now,
in
the
event
that
the
respondent
board
determines
that
a
teacher
should
not
be
renewed,
the
board
is
required
under
ohio
law
to
notify
the
teacher
on
or
before
april
the
30th
of
the
year
in
which
the
contract
is
to
expire.
and
then
recently
our
court
of
ohio
in
tracey
versus
o'steigel
board,
six
ohio
state
third
305,
also
held
that
in
that
notification,
the
board
must
set
forth
the
basic
reason
for
the
non-renewal,
although
the
teacher
is
not
entitled
to
what
they
call
cause
and
a
hearing,
cause
and
hearing
mandate.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes,
your
honor,
the
supreme
court.
it
was
believed
that
since
non-tenured...
non-tenured
teachers
are
not
entitled
to
reasons
for
non-renewal,
since
they
are
on
a
yearly
basis,
and
each
year,
at
the
end
of
the
school
year,
their
contract
terminations
unless
the
school
board
on
or
before
april
30th
determines
it
should
be
renewed,
and
the
teacher
has
until
june
the
4th,
i
believe,
of
that
year
to
determine
whether
he
or
she
will
accept,
and
then
they
are
entered
into
a
written
contract.
in
our
situation
here,
the
respondent
board
held
a
meeting
on
april
the
17th
of
1979,
and
adopted
a
resolution
unanimously
to
renew
the
contract
of
the
petitioner
for
the
ensuing
year,
and
subsequent
to
that
resolution
or
offer
to
continue
her
employment,
the
petitioner
duly
accepted
and
notified
the
board
that
she
accepted
the
offer
to
serve
for
another
year.
one
week
after
the
initial
meeting
of
april
17th,
the
board
called
a
special
meeting
on
april
the
24th,
at
which
time
it
rescinded,
reconsidered
the
renewal
of
the
petitioner
and
rescinded
its
earlier
resolution
to
renew
her,
with
a
majority
of
three,
a
three
to
one
vote,
and
one
member
was
absent
because
he
was
not
notified
of
the...
of
the
special
purpose
of
the
meeting,
and
he
was
at
that
time...
in
fact,
two
members
were
sent
to
florida
as
delegates
of
the
board
at
a
national
education
conference.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
action
of
the
board
in
terminating
the
petitioner,
she
filed
suit
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
trumbull
county,
ohio,
and
in
that
suit
she
challenged
the
validity
of
the
board's
action
in
terminating
her,
and
her
complaint
in
essence
set
forth
a
breach
of
contract,
and
the
second
count,
or
second
cause
of
action,
a
tort
action
in
the
nature
of
a
conspiracy
to
violate
her
contract
of
employment.
the
trial
judge
held
trial.
it
was
a
bench
trial.
at
the
trial
time
he
upon
his
own
motion
reserved
and
continued
the
tort
action,
the
second
cause
of
action,
and
held
trial
only
on
the
narrow
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
board,
respondent
board
acted
in
conformity
with
the
state
law
as
to
its
non-renewal
or
termination
of
the...
of
the
petitioner.
the
court
then
rendered
its
judgment,
found
that
the
petitioner
had
a
binding
contract
with
the
school
board,
that
the
school
board
breached
the
contract,
and
therefore
granted
damages
to
the
petitioner
in
the
amount
of
the
salary
she
lost
for
the
year
and
ordered
her
reinstated
to
her
position,
but
inasmuch
as
the
decision
was
rendered
on
march
the
20th,
and
her
contract
expired
in
june,
she
never
entered
into
her
position
again
for
one
reason
or
another.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
oh,
no
question
about
it,
under
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
congress
has
granted
to
the
states
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
civil
rights,
and
the
civil
rights
suitor,
plaintiff
obviously
had
a
choice.
if
she
felt
comfortable
with
state
court--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--well,
i
take
the
position,
we
take
the
position
that
the
congressional
intent
in
granting
plaintiffs...
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
the
choice
to
go
to
federal
court
or
the
state
court,
we
believe
that
that
grant
by
congress
is
unconditional.
i
think
as
we
understand
the
intent
the
congress
intended
to
allow
the
suitor
to
determine
whether
he
feels
comfortable
in
the
state
court,
for
whatever
reason,
for
local
prejudice
problems,
and
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
believe
that
if...
although
in
our
case
here,
we
will
argue
that
ohio
res
judicata
would
not
preclude,
but
i
would
say
that...
i
would
say
that
if
there
were
a
state
law
to
that
effect,
which
i
would
construe
as
making
it
mandatory,
taking
away
this
free
choice
of
which
court
to
go
to,
and
making
it
mandatory,
i
would
say
that
that
law
or
that
policy
would
clearly
contravene
this
congrsessional
intent
of
allowing
you,
a
civil
rights
plaintiff,
to
choose
without
explanation.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
allen
versus
mccurry
dealt
only
with
collateral
estoppel.
now,
i
say
if
a...
as
i
understand
allen
versus
mccurry,
i
say
if
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
voluntarily
presents
his
claims
to
a
state
court
or
presents
some
issue
that
is
material
or
relevant
to
the
determination
of
a
civil
rights
action,
then
he
certainly
has
waived
it
or
has
foregone
the
right,
or
if
he
is
confronted
with
collateral
estoppel,
i
agree,
he
should
not
relitigate
an
important
material
issue.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
it
is
not
voluntary,
except
in
herring,
i
think,
i
think
there
was
a
strong
motivation
for
herring...
or
to
say
in
herring,
if
you
follow
that,
adopt
that
rule,
there
was
a
strong
motivation
to
say
in
herring,
here,
i
am
faced
with
a
criminal
conviction
that
is
going
to
go
on
my
record,
and
i
have
a
constitutional
defense.
i
have
a
constitutional
defense.
i
am
going
to
raise
that
defense
rather
than
risk
being
convicted
or...
and
having
a
criminal
record,
or
rather
than
risk
this
voluntarily
pleading
guilty,
and
i
think...
but
i
think
the
principle
is
the
same.
i
think
as
justice
marshall
said,
that
they
argued...
the
petitioners
in
that
case
argued
like
our
respondents
are
arguing
here.
they
say
if
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
had
an
opportunity
to
litigate,
to
raise,
to
litigate
and
decide,
then
they
should
be
barred
and
precluded
from
filing
a
subsequent
civil
action,
and
justice
marshall
said,
if
we
adopt
such
a
rule,
it
would
be
anomalous.
and
then
justice
marshall
also
goes
into
running
afoul
of
this
clear
and
established
congressional
intent,
of
this
grave
concern
of
congress
that
a
civil
rights
suitor
should
have
the
selection.
his
very
valuable
civil
rights
should
be,
if
he
chooses,
should
be
considered
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
your
honor
dealt
with
the
collateral
estoppel
statute
of
virginia,
but
as
a
further
argument,
i
would...
i
would...
i
would,
as
an
answer,
like
to
adopt
the
statement
of
justice
harlan
in
monroe
versus
pape,
where
he
said,
"a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
significantly
different
from
and
more
serious
than
a
violation
of
state
right,
and
therefore
deserves
a
different
remedy,
even
though
the
same
act
may
constitute
a
state
tort
and
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
"
and
in
ohio,
incidentally,
under
the...
not
incidentally,
it
is
an
important
aspect
of
our
case...
the
tort,
the
second
count
or
second
cause
of
action
in
the
complaint
in
the
state
action
was
a
tort
action
in
the
nature
of
conspiracy.
when
the
trial
judge
dismissed
that
cause
of
action
and...
that
is,
reserved...
dismissed
it,
he
dismissed
it
without
prejudice,
and
the
language
of
"without
prejudice"
in
ohio
means
that
that
is
to
be
construed
as
an
adjudication
not
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
yes.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
of
course.
judge
manos
did
not
consider
the
legal
aspects
or
legal
consequences
of
a
voluntary
dismissal
without
prejudice,
and
in
ohio
that
is
clear.
that
is
not
adjudication
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
one
of
the
first
and
most
important
elements
of
traditional
res
judicata
is
that
you
must
have
a
determination
on
the
merits
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
and
if
you
don't
have...
and
of
course,
of
course,
the...
in
ohio
there
is
no
problem.
that's
why
we
brought
it
in
federal
court
under,
under
that
situation,
where
a
matter
is
voluntarily
dismissed,
you
can
immediately
turn
around
and
refile
it
the
next
day.
it
is
a...
dismissal
without
prejudice
is
not
considered
a
determination
on
the
merits.
it
is
not...
it
is
not
adjudication
at
all.
so,
in
ohio,
there
is
no
ohio...
there
is
no
present
rule
in
ohio
that
would
bar...
in
my
understanding,
which
would
bar
the
petitioner
from
filing
a
subsequent
state
court
action
or
filing
a
civil
rights
action
in
any
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
which
has
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
jurisdiction
over
the
person.
and
this
court
can
very
well,
if
it
agrees
with
me,
just
stop
there
and
say,
since
ohio
doesn't
consider
it--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--well,
the
district
court
took
a
very
simplistic...
and
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--the
district
court
didn't
go
that
far.
it
didn't
entertain--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--no.
no,
though
we
argued
ohio
law
and
argued
norwood
versus
mcdonald,
which
expresses
ohio
law,
which
is
still
the
law
of
ohio.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
one
order...
one-page
order.
one
paragraph.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
as
i
read
judge
manos's
opinion,
judge
manos...
and
he
cited
another
sixth
circuit
opinion...
he
just
was...
took
the
position
that
since
state
courts
can
entertain
constitutional,
full
constitutional
issues,
that
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
litigate
them
there,
and
since
they
can,
you
are
barred.
it
is
simple
as
that.
now,
the
coogan
case,
i
mean,
there
are
many
areas,
and
sometimes
you
have
to
make
a
fine
distinction
where
the
courts
confuse
collateral
estoppel
with
res
judicata,
and
there
are
many
areas,
and
in
most
cases,
as
i
read
them,
what
really
happens
is,
the
plaintiff
in
the
subsequent
action
or
the
civil
rights
plaintiff,
he
is
a
disgruntled
party.
he
lost
in
the
first
instance.
he
is
seeking
some
way
to
get
a
second
trial.
and
if
you
analyze
it
closely,
what
he
is
really
trying
to
do,
he
wants
to
relitigate
the
issues
that
he
lost
on.
now,
i
believe
in
that
situation,
if
you
adopt
allen
versus
mccurry,
he
runs
into
collateral
estoppel,
and
so
he
lost
on
the
state
level,
he
says,
now
i
am
going
to
frame
the
same
issue
on
a
constitutional
basis
and
see
if
i
can't
get
the
state
court
to
be
more
sympathetic,
and
that
is
coogan,
too,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
but
i
think
in
a
situation
like
ours,
when
you
have...
where...
what
in
effect
the
lower
courts
have
said,
as
i
understand
it,
they
are
making
it
mandatory.
they
are
taking
away
this
choice.
they
say,
since
you
sued
these
same
people
in
the
state
court
on
state
issues,
wouldn't
it
be
better
if
you
brought
your
civil
rights
case
and
we
wrapped
this
up
all
in
one,
prevent
a
multiplicity
of
suits,
and
that's
their
position.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
i
wouldn't
carry
that
that
far.
but
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
constitutional
rights,
and
extend
the
state
authority
to
contravene
federal
constitutional
rights,
and
i
can
say
in
this
situation--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--well,
unless...
i
take
the...
the
statements
this
court
has
made
about
congressional
intent
to
assign
to
a
federal
court
a
paramount
rule
in
protecting,
or
that
the
federal
court
is
a
primary
protector.
i
think
that
that
is
very
important.
now,
in
our
case,
your
honor,
in
our
case
especially,
i
think
a
lawyer
would
be
remiss
if
he
took
the
subsequent
action
in
the
state
court
either
under
a
state
court
action
or
under
federal
action
in
light
of
the
circumstances
in
that
community,
the
sharp,
heated
controversy
in
the
community
about
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
should
be
continued
or
not,
and
having
in
mind
that
you
have
a
state
court
judge
who
has
to
go
before
perhaps
some
of
these
citizens
who
took
the
position
against
the
petitioner.
he
must
rely
upon
those
citizens
to
get
re-elected.
this
judge,
i
can
tell
you,
that
was
very
reluctant
and
very
disturbed
at
having
to
determine
this
action,
and
that
is
why
he
confined
it
to
a
very
narrow
statutory
issue,
because
he
was--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--please?
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
well,
i
am
construing
his...
i
am
construing
the
state
court's--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--i
construed
that
from
the
fact
that
he
could
have.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
from
the
fact
that
he
separated
and
reserved
and
didn't
indicate
any
reason
why
he
didn't
try
both
cases.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
that
is
my
conclusion,
and
also--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
it
is
not
in
the
record
except--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--please?
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
the
record
shows
that
the
state
court
judge
reserved
and
continued
the
second
count,
which
reasonable
minds
would
say
he
should
have
heard
all
at
once.
he
should
have
adopted
this
theory,
this
principle,
let's
decide
all
things
together,
let's
not
have
repetitive
suits.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
judge
did
not
indicate
why
he
did
not
hear
that...
try
that
second
action.
moreover,
the
defendants
did
not
object.
the
defendants
could
have
said,
your
honor,
as
you
are
saying
here,
we
do
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
a
second
suit,
to
the
expense
and
the
aggravation,
the
vexation.
we
want
everything,
and
if
the
judge
had...
judge
had
overruled
them,
they
could
have
appealed
that.
they
could
have
appealed,
and
as
we
are
saying
today,
they
could
have
said
in
the
state
court.
now,
we...
my
argument
is
that
as
i
understand
it
when
congress
enacted
the
civil
rights,
it
wanted
to
remove
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
from
the
local
prejudices
and
the
provincial
influences.
we
were
subjected
to
the
same
local
political
prejudices
and
influences,
and
therefore
we
thought,
we
are
not
going
to
get
a
full
and
fair
hearing
if
we
go
here,
and
we
understand
the
position
of
the
judge.
we
understand
that
he
is
thinking
about
future
election,
and
that's
the
realities
of
life,
and
if
he
can
avoid
antagonizing
anybody,
and
we
have
no
idea
how
widespread
the
opposition...
we
know
that
the
respondents
were
vehement
in
their
opposition,
but
we
do
not
know...
it
may
very
well
involve
other
prominent
citizens.
we
do
know
that
the
state
court
judge
had
some...
had
some
papers
that
respondent
swan
had
gathered,
and
we
have
a
companion
related
case
in
the
district
court,
and
we
felt
perhaps
those
papers
may
reveal
some
information
or
some
relevant
evidence
or
may
lead
us
to,
give
us
information,
and
we
have
waited
two
and
a
half
years
to
have
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
we
can
have
discovery
with
those
papers.
so,
there
are
circumstances
here,
i
think,
that
could
reasonably
construe
from
what
is
in
the
record
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
go
back
to
a
court
in
that
community,
and
fortunately,
the
wisdom
of
congress
said,
you
have
a
selection.
if
you
feel,
without
having
to
justify,
you
feel
you
are
not
comfortable
there,
you
feel
your
rights
may
not
be
given
consideration
as
a
federal
court
would,
you
are
free
to
go
to
federal
court,
and
that
is
what
we
have
done.
that
is
what
we
have
done.
and
we
place
great
weight
on
civil
rights,
on
the
dignity
of
the
human
being.
i
think
there
isn't
anything
more
sacred
in
a
person's
life
than
his
right
to
his
good
name,
honor,
and
reputation,
and
to
his
right
to
make
his
livelihood
in
a
vocation
or
profession
of
his
own
choosing.
this
is
what
is
involved
here.
these
respondents
were
free
and
protected
by
the
law.
if
they
felt
that
the
performance
or
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
did
not
conform
to
what
they
thought
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
school
district
or
the
best
interests
of
the
children
and
the
students,
they
were
free
to
come
to
a
board
meeting
and
say
openly.
even
if
what
they
said
was
not
accurate
or
true,
they
would
have
been
protected,
and
i
say,
i
don't
think
that
dr.
migra
ought
to
be
renewed
because
of
this
and
that,
and
i
don't
think
she's
good
for
our
system,
and
i
don't
like
her
philosophies,
and
i
don't
like
her
political
beliefs,
or
i
don't
like
how
she
selects
books
for
the
curriculum,
or
i
don't
like
how
aggressive
she
is
in
desegregation,
and
they
could
have
said
that
openly,
because
in
their
heart
they
were
genuine.
they
had
a
right
to
say
that.
that
is
why
they
were
elected,
to
express
what
they
felt,
and
they
felt,
to
protect
my
constituents
who
put
me
on
this
board,
i
have
an
obligation
to
see
that
we
do
not
continue,
we
do
not
continue
dr.
migra.
they
could
have
done
that,
not
to
call
a
meeting...
call
a
meeting
when
they
sent
two
delegates
to
florida,
and
not
to
reconsider
when
they
had
a
contract,
they
had
a
binding
contract.
they
had
counsel,
they
had
local
counsel,
the
city
solicitor.
they
could
have
said,
counselor,
can
we
call
a
special
meeting?
can
we
validly
reconsider
what
we
did
a
week
ago
unanimously
and
rescind?
can
we
do
that?
they
didn't
do
that.
now,
when
they
had--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
may
it
please
the
court,
first,
i
think
we
must
straighten
the
record
out,
and
i...
with
all
due
respect
to
counsel,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
far
as
a
determination
by
the
trial
court
that
the
basis
for
which
the
board
did
not
renew
because
they
did
away
with
the
job
or
any
other
reason,
that
was
a
very
easy
way
out
for
them.
if
that
was
their
position,
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
engage
in
this
wave
of
scandal--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
i
just--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--yes,
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
relitigate
the
contract.
we
are
seeking
to
litigate
rights
which
were
not
before
the
court,
federal
rights,
the
right
to
be
notified
of
charges,
and
to
a
fair
hearing,
to
defend,
the
inviolate
right
to
a
person's
good
name,
honor,
and
reputation
in
the
community,
the
right
to
express
one's--
mr.
john
r.
vintilla
--yes,
they
were...
it
is
analogous.
if
the
court
had
determined
the
tort
action,
we
would
have
lost.
we
would
have
been
in
great
difficulty,
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
remand
to
determine
ohio
law,
this
court
and
federal
courts,
unless
there
is
a
conflict,
there
is
a
reason
to
abstain.
ohio
law
is
clear
as
to
what
voluntary
dismissal
means,
and
i
think
there
is
no
need
for
that,
and
so
i
want
to
tell
this
court
it
has
been
a
privilege
and
an
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court.
