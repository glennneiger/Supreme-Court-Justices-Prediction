unknown
speaker
mr.
boyd,
may
i
ask
about
the
law
of
mississippi?
when
did
this
death
occur
in
relation
to
the
time
of
the
accident?
unknown
speaker
instantaneously?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
circumstance
under
mississippi
law
could
the
state
have
tried
both
the
misdemeanor
and
the
felony
charges
in
one
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
they
could
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
any
mississippi
statute
that
required
the
trial
of
those
charges,
the
misdemeanor
charges,
in
the
justice
of
the
peace
court
independently
of
any
other
court?
unknown
speaker
are
the
misdemeanor
offenses
charged
by
indictment
in
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
a
traffic
citation?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
by
the
policeman?
unknown
speaker
and
how
are
felonies
charged
then
in
mississippi?
only
by
indictment?
unknown
speaker
mississippi
doesn't
use
a
preliminary
hearing
type?
unknown
speaker
and
this
would
be
at
the
request
of
the
county
attorney
or
whoever
the
local
prosecutor
is
for
felons?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
when
you
say
nothing
to
stop
you,
did
that
mean
that
the
attorney
general's
office
could
have
tried
all
of
these
offenses,
misdemeanor
and
felony,
in
the
circuit
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
suggest
that
yes?
unknown
speaker
that
might
have
happened.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
not
happen.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
this
case
the
misdemeanor
offenses
were
tried
in
what
court?
unknown
speaker
which
is...
and
that
would
be
a
county
prosecutor,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
the
felony
indictment
was
tried
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
who
was
the
prosecutor
there?
unknown
speaker
the
district
attorney
is
a
regional
district
attorney.
unknown
speaker
would
you
clarify
that
a
little
more?
it
is
a
confusing
system.
unknown
speaker
in
1979,
when
this
particular
respondent
was
charged
and
tried,
were
there
different
prosecutors
involved
in
the
two
different
courts?
unknown
speaker
and
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
brought
all
of
the
charges
in
one
court?
unknown
speaker
you
say
beat
one,
mr.
boyd.
are
there
several
different
beats
for
justice
courts
in
tallahachee?
unknown
speaker
is
there
also
a
circuit
court
in
tallahachee
county?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
circuit
court
for
what,
the
fifteenth--
unknown
speaker
--and
is
there
a
resident
circuit
judge
in
tallahachee
county,
or
does
the
circuit
judge
just
come
part
of
the
time?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
matter
of
coincidence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
boyd,
at
the
time
the
offenses
in
the
justice
court
were
being
prosecuted,
were
there
any
proceedings
going
on
arising
from
the
death
of
the
little
girl?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
any
charge
before
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
would
it
have
been
possible
to
have
an
earlier
indictment,
earlier
than
december?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
so
the
delay
in
the
charge
of
the
felony
was
due
entirely
to
mississippi's
procedure
for
charging
felonies?
unknown
speaker
did
someone
have
authority
to
convene
the
grand
jury
specially?
unknown
speaker
do
they
now?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
explanation
of
the
nolle
prossed--
unknown
speaker
--they
just
nolle
prossed
the
misdemeanor
charges
and
went
ahead
with
the
manslaughter
indictment.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
where
was
the
post-conviction
relief
sought
first,
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
was
filed
here?
unknown
speaker
and
denied?
unknown
speaker
and
then
to
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
and
the
double
jeopardy
claim
that
is
here
was
presented
in
the
coram
nobis
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
are
correct
about
that,
what
do
we
do
with
the
language
in
vitalli
that
talked
about
the
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim
which
would
be
available
if
the
prosecution
relied
upon
and
used
the
same
evidence
in
the
proof
of
both?
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
was
the
same,
i
suppose,
except
for
the
establishment
of
the
death
of
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
still
have
to
find
for
one
crime
an
element
that
you
didn't
have
to
from
the
other
from
those
same
facts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
boyd,
before
you
sit
down,
isn't
another
issue
we
have
to
address
apart
from
double
jeopardy,
didn't
both
the
district
court
and
the
magistrate,
at
least,
rely
on
blackledge--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
mentioned
it
but
didn't
address
it.
don't
we
have
to?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
double
jeopardy
point,
don't
we
have
to
address
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
that
means
we
can
avoid
addressing
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
ask
them...
i
see.
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
boyd?
in
your
view,
is
the...
i
am
troubled
about
the
nolle
prossing
of
the
misdemeanor
charges.
was
that
tantamount
to
an
acquittal
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
i
don't
understand
how
there
can
never
be
a
double
jeopardy
question.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
just
like
a
voluntary
dismissal
without...
they
could
have
been
reinstated
as
a
matter
of
mississippi
law?
unknown
speaker
would
you
need
to
prove
death
on
the
first
charge?
unknown
speaker
would
you
need
to
prove
it
on
the
second?
unknown
speaker
pretty
big
difference,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
dismissed
the
death
factor
rather
swiftly.
unknown
speaker
and
the
evidence
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
is
not
the
same
here.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
brown
against
ohio,
mr.
barksdale,
was
two
separate
ohio
circuit
court
prosecutions,
common
pleas
prosecutions.
here
you
have
a
non-record
court
or...
you
know
better
than
i
do
what
the
justice
court
is
in
mississippi,
and
then
a
circuit
court.
don't
you
think
that
at
least
factually
distinguishes
it
from
brown?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
need
to
reach
it,
but
it
must
be
reached
by
somebody.
we
don't
need
to
reach
it,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
barksdale,
again,
i
think
the
procedural
thing
may
be
complicated
by
terminology.
i
would
have
thought
a
preliminary
hearing,
based
on
my
own
prior...
was
after
an
information
had
been
filed
by
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
then
a
preliminary
hearing
would
be
seeing
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
you
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
i
gather,
what,
a
preliminary
hearing
in
mississippi
is
instituted
by
a
complaining
witness?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
make
of
that?
you
kind
of
criticize
your
opponent
for
making
nothing
of
it.
what
do
you
make
of
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
preliminary
hearing
of
the
kind
that
you
reported
or
show
was
held
in
august,
is
that
prosecuted
by
a
prosecuting
attorney?
unknown
speaker
how
about
mississippi
practice?
i
mean,
would
it
be
customary
for
a
prosecuting
attorney
to
be
present
at
a
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
difference
would
it
make
whether
he
pled
guilty
or
was
tried?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
right
there
about
the
dismissal,
the
nolle
pros
of
the
charges
later
on?
do
you
agree
that
was
without
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
i
always
thought
that
was
a
voluntary
dismissal,
and
you
could
always
reinstate
charges
that
had
been
nolle
prossed,
but
that
is
not
your
understanding?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
must
be
mississippi
law
on
that,
mr.
barksdale,
whether
a
charge
that
has
been
nolle
prossed
can
be
filed
again.
usually
they
can
be
filed
again
if
they
have
been
nolle
prossed.
you
suggest
mississippi
law
is
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
judgment
that
constitutes
the
bar
to
the
second
trial.
that
is
the
key
to
your
whole
case,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
and
then
as
a
matter
of...
in
your
two-stage
trial
proceeding,
he
had
the
right
to
have
that
judgment
just
set
aside
as
though
it
had
never
occurred.
unknown
speaker
and
then
they
dismiss
the
trial
de
novo,
and
then
the
judgment
that
has
been
set
aside
is
what
bars
a
new
prosecution.
i
just...
i
have
trouble
grasping
this
whole
case.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
state's
only
option
at
that
point
was
to
try
him
again
for
the
misdemeanors.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
have,
yes,
but
you
say
that
was
their
only
option.
they
couldn't
go
ahead
and
try
him
for
manslaughter.
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
have
been
guilty
of
manslaughter
on
any
one
of
those,
wouldn't
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
not
have
been
found
guilty
in
the
second
stage
unless
there
was
a
demonstration
that
someone
had
been
killed
as
a
result
of
that.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
i
take
it
your
submission
is
that
under
our
cases,
that
if
in
proving
him
guilty
of
the
larger
offense
they
again
proved
the
misdemeanors
that
he
had
already
been
convicted
of,
that
was
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
brown
and
harris.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
court
meant
by
that
language,
that
he
would
have
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim?
do
you
think
that
meant
that
he
would
have
a
patently
sustainable
claim,
or
a
colorable
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
work
for
him.
unknown
speaker
you
ought
to
ask
the
court.
that
was
a
court
opinion.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
case
of
someone
who
might
have
been
injured
in
the
traffic
accident
in
august
and
who
dies
in
november?
that
obviously
isn't
this
case,
but
how
would
your
reasoning
affect
that?
could
they
have
tried
him
for
the
misdemeanors
in
august,
there
at
that
time
being
no
manslaughter
charge
available
because
the
person
was
still
alive,
and
then
come
back
and
indict
them
as
they
did
here
for
manslaughter
in
december?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
same
evidence
theory,
even
on
the
example
posed
by
justice
rehnquist,
you
would
say
double
jeopardy
attaches.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
talking
about
the
language
in
vitalli.
unknown
speaker
that
is
unclear.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
decide
the
same
crime
test,
did
they,
the
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
was
uncertain
about
the
first
part
of
the
vitalli
test,
and
therefore
went
on
to
look
at
the
same
evidence
question.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
whatever...
that
language
in
vitalli
couldn't
have
been
any
more
than
just
a
dictum.
after
all,
the
holding
was,
there
wasn't
any
double
jeopardy
in
vitalli.
unknown
speaker
well,
illinois
said
there
was
double
jeopardy,
and
we
reversed
them
and
said
at
that
point
there
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
we
reversed
them.
we
reversed
their
holding
that
at
that
time
there
had
been
a
showing
of
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
so
whatever
miscellaneous
advice
we
might
have
given
them
later
in
the
opinion
wasn't
a
holding,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
couldn't
have
just
reversed
them
citing
that
line
in
vitalli,
that
there
was
a
substantial
claim.
it
went
back,
they
decided,
well,
however
substantial
it
was,
it
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
couldn't
just
reverse
them
citing
that
page
in
vitalli.
do
you
know
whether
they
reversed
or
vacated?
did
you
vacate
or
reverse?
well,
we
set
aside
their
judgment--
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position,
mr.
barksdale,
that
even
though
there
is
a
different
element
in
each
statutory
offense
with
which
one
is
charged,
if
the
same
evidence
is
used
to
prove
both,
it
is
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
one
is
tried
for,
say,
reckless
driving,
and
found
guilty
by
a
jury
of
that
on
the
grounds
of
recklessness,
and
then
the
same
evidence
is
produced
on
the
charge
of
intentional
homicide,
that
the
person
actually
intended
to
run
the
person
over.
now,
the
state
doesn't
introduce
any
more
evidence
than
it
did
at
the
first
trial,
but
it
simply
asks
the
jury
to
infer
instead
of
reckless
disregard
deliberate
intent.
now,
if
it
wouldn't
be
in
violation
of
double
jeopardy
otherwise,
would
it
be
because
there
is
no
new
evidence
introduced?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
a
question
necessarily
of
what
is
necessary,
but
what
the
constitution
forbids.
unknown
speaker
in
the
cases
where
the
key
to
it
is
whether
additional
evidence
or
different
evidence
must
be
used,
what
do
you
think
the
court
was
driving
at?
when
you
say
it
is...
there
is
just
one
more
element
that
needs
to
be
proved,
that
is,
death.
unknown
speaker
could
they
convict
in
the
second
case
without
showing
that
someone
had
been
killed?
unknown
speaker
could
they
make
the
first
case
without
proving
someone
had
been
killed?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
isn't
that
quite
a
bit
of
different
evidence?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
offense?
what
was
the
same
offense?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you
what
was
the
same
offense?
unknown
speaker
that
is
manslaughter?
unknown
speaker
they
had
to
prove
death.
was
death
important
in
both
cases?
unknown
speaker
was
death,
d-e-a-t-h,
important
in
both?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
even
need
it
in
the
first
one.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
without
that
element,
you
couldn't
have
gotten
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
now,
has
mr.
roberts
ever
even
paid
the
fine
that
was
levied
at
the
first
misdemeanor
trial?
unknown
speaker
presumably
that
was
set
aside--
unknown
speaker
--in
his
de
novo
appeal,
so
right
now
there
is
nothing,
no
penalty
has
been
attached.
unknown
speaker
is
he
out
of
jail
now,
ever
since
'82?
unknown
speaker
was
he
ever
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
for
what
period
of
time?
unknown
speaker
from
the
time
of
affirmance
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
until,
what,
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
are
wrong
and
the
other
side
wins,
what
will
happen
to
the
gentleman
on
whose
behalf
you
are
speaking?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
means
that
you
are
supporting
him
to
some
extent.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
blackledge
point?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
why
should
the
prophylactic
rule
set
forth
in
blackledge
apply
when
you
have
two
different
prosecuting
attorneys
and
presumably
two
different
charging
procedures
and
the
timing
is
different
on
the
charges?
it
just...
you
don't
have
the
circumstances
that
would
lead
you
to
need
a
prophylactic
rule,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood
the
responses
to
the
questions
earlier
by
mr.
boyd,
i
thought
that
a
district
attorney
was
involved
in
the
circuit
court
charging
of
felonies.
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
misunderstood.
unknown
speaker
who
decides
whether
to
present
this
case
to
the
grand
jury?
it
is
the
district
attorney,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
enough
reason
not
to
apply
the
prophylactic
rule
in
blackledge,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument
even
if
the
county
attorney
were
not
involved?
unknown
speaker
except
it
is
really
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
a
defendant
is
convicted
of
robbery
and
then
the
state
indicts
him
for
felony
murder,
and
the
proof
offered
is
that
the
underlying
felony
is
robbery,
and
it
is
the
same
robbery
that
they
just
convicted
him
of,
but
they
prove
the
robbery,
and
then
they
prove
death.
what...
was
it
brown
or
harris
that
said
that
was
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
harris.
unknown
speaker
harris.
unknown
speaker
and
the
rationale
is
that
they
have
convicted
him
of
the
underlying
felony,
and
if
that
is
what
they
prove
in
proving
felony
murder,
they
have
violated
his
double
jeopardy
rights?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
we
have
held?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
are
going
to.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
harris,
you
didn't
need
to
prove
a
robbery
to
prove
felony
murder.
you
could
have
proved
some
other
felony,
as
far
as
the
statute
was
concerned.
but
the
fact
is,
the
state
proved
the
very
robbery.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
really.
it
was
just...
that
was
just
one
of
the
kinds
of
felony
murder.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
ask
a
question
before
you
sit
down,
please,
about
the
preliminary
hearing
that
was
held
in
justice
court--
unknown
speaker
--in
august
on
the
manslaughter
charge.
unknown
speaker
why
would
a
preliminary
hearing
have
been
held
on
the
manslaughter
charge?
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know
why
it
was
held.
i
thought
they
would
have
a
hearing
to
see
if
they
would
bind
him
over
for
the
grand
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
it
isn't
a
question
of
when,
but
wouldn't
you
normally
have
a
preliminary
hearing
to
see
if
you
would
hold
him
for
a
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
he
would
have
been
out
of
jail
meanwhile.
unknown
speaker
yes.
