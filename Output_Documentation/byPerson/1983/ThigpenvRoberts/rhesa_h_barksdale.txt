mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
the
court
knows,
i
appear
as
amicus
curiae
on
invitation
from
the
court
to
present
argument
in
support
of
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
we
filed
a
brief
upon
which
the
argument
to
be
presented
today
relies.
the
single
question
presented
to
this
court
is,
does
or
did
the
fifth
circuit
correctly
apply
the
holding
in
vitalli.
as
will
be
further
discussed,
and
as
is
discussed
fully
in
our
brief,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
correctly
apply
the
language
in
vitalli
for
a
two-trial
situation.
that
is
the
important
criteria.
have
there
been
two
trials?
this
isn't
an
interlocutory
appeal.
two
trials
have
been
held.
we
think
the
test
to
be
applied
where
two
trials
have
been
held
is
as
follows.
there
is
double
jeopardy
where
the
same
factual
elements
used
for
the
second
prosecution
were
proved
in
the
other
or
first
prosecution,
which
simply
is
what
i
believe
this
court
held
in
brown
versus
ohio.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir.
at
the
first
charge,
of
course--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--at
the
second,
of
course,
your
honor,
you
have
got
to
prove
death
in
the
manslaughter.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir,
because
at
the
second
you
have
proved
everything
else
that
you
proved
at
the
first,
and
if
we
allow
the
state,
as
in
this
instance,
to
try
a
man,
and
i
will
get
to
this
later...
there
was
no
guilty
plea
to
my
knowledge.
to
try
and
convict
a
man
in
justice
court
of
all
of
the
elements
and
then
to
go
to
circuit
court
and
retry
and
reprove
all
of
those
elements
again
and
add
death,
which
is
undisputed,
it
is
simply
letting
the
state
have
two
bites
out
of
the
apple
and
have
a
dress
rehearsal
of
their
case.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir,
the
death
factor
is
a
given.
but
as
i
understand
the
underlying
purpose
of
double
jeopardy,
it
is
to
prohibit,
as
you
yourself
stated
in
breed
versus
jones,
two
trials
or
multiple
trials,
where
there
is
the
attendant
physical,
psychological,
and
financial
stress,
and
the
fact
that
the
state
is
given
the
chance
to
have
a
dry
run
or
a
dress
rehearsal.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir,
where
the
evidence
is
the
same.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
it
is
the
same,
your
honor,
for
the
lesser
included
offense,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
and
then
you
add
one
given,
manslaughter
or
death.
i
don't
disregard
the
death,
but
i
think
you
have
proved,
in
order
to
prove
manslaughter
in
this
instance,
the
state,
if
you
want
to
call
it,
had
to
prove
the
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does,
because
you
may
have
had
two
different...
you
had
the
court
of
kihoba
county
and
some
other...
marion
county
in
ohio
on
those
two
offenses,
but
the
jp
court
is
a
separate
court
in
that
sense
from
the
justice
court.
you
say
i
may
know
better
than
you.
i
am
not
sure
anybody
knows
really
the
justice
court
system
in
mississippi.
i
don't
say
that
flippantly,
but
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
fathom.
but
i
don't
see
any
distinction
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
it
is
an
appeal
from
the
justice
court
to
the
circuit
court.
as
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out,
i
think
if
this
court
does
not
rest...
bottom
this
decision
on
vitalli
and
double
jeopardy,
it
must
reach
the
due
process
blackledge
claim.
in
fact,
although
we
don't
stress
this
in
our
brief--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--that's
correct.
i
think
this
court
should
reach
it,
your
honor,
if
blackledge
means
what
it
says,
and
i
think
that
it
does.
i
disagree
with
my
friend,
mr.
boyd.
i
don't
believe
that
goodwin
has
overturned
blackledge.
goodwin
went
off
on
entirely
different
facts.
this
case
falls
squarely
under
blackledge,
and
i
think
this
court
should
affirm
on
that
ground.
now,
i
think
some
important
procedural
points
need
to
be
addressed
here,
because
the
court
is
obviously
interested
in
them.
this
accident
occurred
on
august
the
6th,
1977.
mr.
boyd
has
not
pointed
out,
and
i
am
sure
it
is
by
oversight,
and
it
is
something
that
doesn't
jump
right
out
and
grab
you
out
of
this
joint
appendix,
there
was
a
preliminary
hearing
in
this
case
on
august
the
10th,
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
71.
it
is
just
an
innocuous
exhibit
to
the
writ
of
coram
nobis,
but
it
is
there.
and
a
preliminary
hearing
was
held
at
which
an
affidavit
was
filed
by
the
father
of
this
young
girl
in
which
he
charged
mr.
roberts
with
manslaughter.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
it
would
have
to
be
instituted,
i
assume,
by
the
complaining
witness,
and
mr.
boyd
can
possibly
fill
in
the
gaps
here,
but
the
complaining
witness
at
page
71
states
that...
this
is
the
same
justice
judge,
by
the
way,
that
tried
and
convicted
mr.
roberts
on
the
four
offenses...
that
the
father
made
affidavit
that
"mr.
roberts
did
unlawfully
and
feloniously
commit
manslaughter.
"
and
then
there
is
a
notation,
"a
preliminary
hearing
was
held
in
my
court
for
barry
joe
roberts
on
this
charge
of
manslaughter.
"
now,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anything
else
in
the
joint
appendix
before
this
court
or
the
transcript
of
record
before
this
court
about
this
preliminary
hearing,
but
some
sort
of
hearing
was
held.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
oh,
i
don't
criticize
mr.
boyd,
your
honor.
i
am
just
pointing
out
that
a
preliminary
hearing
was
held
and
he...
justice
o'connor
asked
him
was
anything
going
on
on
the
manslaughter
while
these
misdemeanors.
yes,
a
preliminary
hearing
had
been
held,
a
manslaughter
charge
filed.
to
me,
what
i
make
of
it
is
that
the
state
certainly
was
aware
that
it
was
going
to
probably
seek
a
manslaughter
indictment
of
roberts,
and
therefore
should
have
proceeded
extremely
cautiously
on
trying
him
on
these
misdemeanor
charges.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
think
under
the
general
statutes
it
states,
and
we
cite
in
our
brief
at
footnote
8
at
page
58
through
60
talking
about
the
general
powers
a
county
attorney
had
back
in
1977.
they
are
even
broader
now.
that
the
county
attorney
is
charged
with
being
responsible
for
the
matters
tried
in
his
county,
and
certainly
he
should
have
been
present
at
that
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
now,
the
preliminary
hearing
was
held
on
august
the
10th.
the
justice
court
system
in
mississippi
which
mr.
boyd
has
stated,
the
justice
judges
are
not
required
to
have
any
legal
training.
they
are
simply
elected
officials,
and
at
the
trial
on
august
the
13th,
it
is
my
understanding
of
this
record
that
roberts
was
tried
and
found
guilty.
mr.
boyd
for
the
first
time
in
his
reply
brief
states
that
mr.
roberts
pled
guilty,
and
that
may
be
in
some
part
of
the
record
that
i
don't
have,
but
i
don't
see
it
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
don't
see
it
in
the
transcript
of
the
record.
in
fact,
in
the
error
coram
nobis,
the
man
says
he
was
tried
and
convicted
in
justice
court.
the
magistrate
says
he
was
tried
and
convicted,
and--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
possibly
the
state
thinks
it
makes
some
difference
under
coulton,
that
he
could
have
avoided
the
hazards
of
double
jeopardy
by
simply
pleading
guilty
and
then
moving
on.
to
me
it
is
irrelevant
whether
he
pled
guilty
in
justice
court
or
whether
he
was
tried
in
justice
court.
jeopardy
attached.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
don't
agree
it
was
without
prejudice,
your
honor.
to
me
it
is
an
acquittal,
where
they
remanded
to
the
file.
to
me
it
is
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
i
would
think
that
by
now
the
statute
of
limitations
surely
had
run.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
don't
have
that
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
roberts
at
the
justice
court
trial--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
my
understanding
was
that
to
remand
it
to
the
file,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
is
like
an
acquittal
in
this
kind
of
charge.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir.
to
me
the
judgment
that
constitutes
the
bar
to
the
second
trial
is
the
judgment
in
justice
court
back
in
august
of
1977,
where
he
was
tried
and
convicted
of
the
four
misdemeanors.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
the
judgment
is
set
aside.
he
is
given
trial
de
novo
in
circuit
court.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
he
was
awaiting
his
trial
de
novo,
new
trial.
while
he
was
awaiting
new
trial,
he
was
indicted
for
manslaughter
in
december
of
'77.
in
may
of
'78,
they
are
consolidated.
they
come
on
for
trial.
at
some
point
during
the
proceeding,
the
state
elected
to
remand
to
the
file
those
misdemeanor
charges.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
believe
they
could
have,
your
honor,
if
they
had
done
so--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--they
couldn't
try
him
for
manslaughter.
no,
sir.
they
remanded
those
cases
to
the
file.
they
proceeded
with
the
manslaughter
and
he
was
convicted
of
manslaughter
based
on
the
jury
instructions
which
the
fifth
circuit
looked
to.
the
court
said
to
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
he
was
culpably
negligent
in,
one,
driving
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road,
two,
driving
recklessly,
three,
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol,
and
driving
without
a
license...
it
was
in
the
conjunctive...
then
you
find
him
guilty
of
manslaughter.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
he
certainly
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
that
is
our
thinking,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
our
point,
as
the
court
did
in--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--brown
and
harris.
and
as
this
court
said
in
vitalli.
if
when
you
go
back
to
the
state
of
illinois
in
vitalli,
if
the
state
in
order
to
prove
manslaughter
finds
it
necessary
to
prove
failure
to
reduce
speed,
then
they
have
used
the
same
elements,
and
he
would
have
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
we
think
that's
precisely
why
this
case
falls
under
that.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
wish
you
would
ask
justice
white
and
tell
me.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
to
me,
as
we
say
in
our
brief--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--to
me,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
we
thought
that
justice
white
was
using
that
dictum
so
that
he
wouldn't
prejudge
the
case
on
remand
to
illinois,
and
as
the
dissent
said,
they
didn't
know
why
it
was
called
substantial
double
jeopardy.
to
them
it
was
double
jeopardy.
but
i
don't
know
what
is
meant
by
substantial
other
than
the
fact
that
this
court
was
not
prejudging
what
was
going
to
happen
in
illinois.
a
couple
of
other
procedural
points
that
perhaps
would
assist
the
court.
there
is
a
close
association
between
the
county
and
district
attorneys.
the
county
attorney
was
at
the
arraignment.
in
fact,
the
county
attorney
is
charged
under
the
statute
with
bringing
matters
before
the
grand
jury.
the
county
attorney
was
at
the
trial.
so
this
isn't
as
if
the
two
gentlemen
were
operating
in
a
vacuum.
all
of
these
offenses
could
have
been
tried
in
the
circuit
court.
they
could
have
waited.
they
could
have
indicted
for
manslaughter.
then
they
could
have
tried
the
misdemeanors
and
manslaughter
in
circuit
court,
apparently
all
without
having
to
go
to
justice
court
under
the
fact
that
the
circuit
court
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
as
mr.
boyd
has
clarified
this
afternoon,
the
state
could
have
called
a
special
grand
jury.
now,
it
elected
not
to
do
so,
but
in
effect
it
is
irrelevant.
they
could
have
simply
waited
until
december.
if
they
were
going
to
indict
him
for
manslaughter,
they
could
have
done
so.
then
they
could
have
brought
on
all
the
charges.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
of
course,
that
is
what
some
of
the
cases
have
addressed,
where
the
court
has
said
you
cannot
try
the
lesser
included
offense
and
then
try
the
greater
unless
at
the
original
onset
you
couldn't
have
tried
the
lesser
included.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
again
that's
a
balancing
factor
under
the
constitution
where
if
the
state
didn't
have
a
pretty
good
reason
to
know
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
death,
they
could
have
gone
ahead.
but
i
think
realistically
speaking,
every
time
there
is
an
injury
in
an
accident,
the
state
ought
to
see
that
as
a
red
flag,
as
a
buzzer
to
wait
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
indict
him.
there
is
no
need
to
rush
to
judgment
on
this.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
ma'am,
i
would,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out,
justice
o'connor,
i
am
not
urging
the
same
evidence
test
that
is
referred
to
in
blockburger.
i
am
urging
a
horse
of
an
entirely
different
color.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
well,
it
is
clear
to
me.
it
may
be
unclear
to
others.
0
[generallaughter.]
and
i
think
it
said
that
if
the
state
goes
back
to
illinois
and
convicts
him
of
manslaughter
based
upon
the
lesser
included
offense,
they
just
bought
double
jeopardy.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
think
they
did,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit,
when...
it
said
there
are
two
prongs
under
vitalli.
the
first
prong
is
blockburger,
and
they
said,
well,
we
think
this
meets
blockburger,
but
that
means
we
have
got
to
apply
judicial
veneer.
we
are
not
going
to
do
that.
we
are
going
to
look
to
the
second
prong.
under
the
language
in
vitalli,
they
said--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
was
uncertain
whether
they
could
apply
this
to
the
judicial
veneer,
but
i
don't
know
why
they
are
uncertain.
i
believe
the
court
did
that
in
vitalli.
the
court
did
that
in
brown.
it
looks
at
how
the
states
have
interpreted
it,
and
the
state
of
mississippi
has
interpreted
manslaughter
when
an
automobile
is
involved
to
mean
wanton
and
reckless
conduct,
which
is
the
same
language
you
find
for
reckless
driving.
the
petitioner
here
urges
the
court
to
utilize
blockburger
for
a
two-trial
action,
and
that
is
where
we
differ.
while
blockburger
may
be
appropriate
in
some
instances
on
an
interlocutory
appeal,
it
is
not
appropriate
where
there
have
been
two
trials
and
all
the
evidence
is
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioner
has
ever
really
addressed
vitalli
and
the
clear
language
there
where
the
court
said
if
it
is
necessary
when
you
go
back
to
illinois,
if
you
have
to
prove
failure
to
slow
with
a
misdemeanor
in
order
to
prove
your
manslaughter,
then
you
have
got
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
the
court
said
that
twice,
and
i
think
it
is
clear,
and
i
think
other
courts
have
had
no
problem
in
utilizing
that
point,
as
did
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
roberts
case,
which
is
before
the
court.
yet
that
is
the
question
before
this
court,
was
vitalli
correctly
applied.
here,
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
of
the
four
misdemeanors
for
which
again
it
is
my
understanding
based
on
this
record
he
was
tried
and
convicted.
he
was
given
a
sentence
of
eleven
months
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
the
holding
was
that
this
court
said
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
take
another
look
at
it
under
brown
and
harris.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
you
reversed
and
remanded,
your
honor,
to
have
them
look
at
it
again.
there
wasn't
any
final--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--yes,
sir,
but
you
sent
it
back
for
them
to
decide.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
that
wasn't
miscellaneous
advice.
that
was
the
standard
to
be
applied
by
the
court
in
illinois
when
you
sent
it
back
and
said
take
another
look
at
it.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
you
could
have
reversed
them
under
blockburger,
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
the
state
here
concedes,
and
i
think
it
is
extremely
important,
at
page
19
of
its
brief
that
the
evidence
necessary
to
prove
the
charge
of
reckless
driving
was
introduced
to
establish
manslaughter.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
and
as
i
have
earlier
stated,
the
instruction
to
the
jury,
a
very
cryptic
instruction,
says,
if
you
find
that
he
did
in
fact
commit
the
four
offenses,
and
they
made
the
jury
find
all
four,
then
he
is
guilty
of
manslaughter.
i
think
all
of
this
boils
down
to,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
this
instance,
which
is
to
allow
the
state
only
one
trial
of
the
same
offense
to
prevent
a
dress
rehearsal.
certainly
they
didn't
need
a
dress
rehearsal
in
this
case,
but
the
prophylactic
rule
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
obviously
goes
beyond
this
case.
it
is
our
contention
that
vitalli
did
not
change
double
jeopardy
law,
as
is
being
urged
here.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
change
the
well
established
double
jeopardy
law,
as
seems
to
be
urged
here.
it
is
our
contention
that
both
simply
applied
the
law
that
this
court
has
applied
for
years,
going
all
the
way
back
to
in
re
neilson.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
if
the
same
evidence
is
used
to
prove
the
factual
elements
of
the
lesser
offense
in
order
to
prove
the
greater
offense,
then
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
notwithstanding
additional
elements
will
have
to
be
proved,
such
as
death.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir,
because
they
are
again
proving
the
same
offense,
and
it
is
trying
the
man
twice
on
the
same
evidence,
and
they
have
been
allowed
at
the
first
trial
to
work
on
their
case
and
sharpen
up
their
case
to
use
it
again
and
to
simply
say
to
the
jury
if
you
find
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
plus
f,
then
you
can
convict
him
a
second
time.
why
is
that
necessary?
why
can't
the
state
wait
and
do
it
all
at
one
time?
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
well,
i
think
the
constitution
forbids
it,
and
i
think
it
is
easy
for
the
state
to
operate
within
those
constitutional
restraints.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
under
the
blockburger
test,
which
talks
of,
if
two
offenses
can
be
proved
out
of
the
same
transaction,
you
look,
does
each
offense
require
proof
of
a
fact
that
the
other
does
not,
i
think
that
is
simply
the
court
without
the
evidence
before
it
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
or
before
trial
is
ever
held
saying,
now,
this
is
our
best
way
to
try
to
make
sure
there
is
no
double
jeopardy.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
oh,
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
in
the
severity,
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
in
the
double
jeopardy
basis,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
he
has
been
tried
twice
for
the
same
offense.
and
they
have
simply
upped
the
ante
the
second
time
around.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
the
same
offense
the
fifth
circuit
looked
to
and
just
simply
went
off
reckless
driving.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
to
me
the
same
offense
were
all
four
misdemeanors,
your
honor,
reckless
driving,
driving
without
a
license,
driving
under
the
influence,
and
driving--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--because
they
used
that
and
nothing
else
to
prove
manslaughter,
that
is
double
jeopardy,
your
honor.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir,
it
was
not...
it
is
certainly
important
in
both
cases.
it
was
not
relevant
in
the
first
case.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
there
is
a
difference
of
one
additional
element,
your
honor,
but
for
the
fact
of
what
he
was
tried
for
in
the
first
case,
he
was
tried
again
in
the
second.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
no,
sir.
that's
stipulated,
that
there
was
manslaughter,
or
at
least
death.
in
any
event,
we
feel
that
the
test
this
court
utilized,
for
example,
in
brown,
in
harris,
and
stated
to
the
illinois
court
to
utilize
well
serves
the
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
that
was
set
aside.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
all
i
know
is
what
is
in
the
record
i
was
given,
is
that
those
were
nolle
prossed.
apparently
nothing
else
has
been
done
on
them.
he
was
let
out
of
jail
in
1982,
and
i
doubt
he
has
paid
them.
i
don't
know
the--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--it
is
my
understanding
that
he
is,
your
honor,
but
i
haven't
confirmed
that.
i
haven't
checked
to
see
if
he
is
out
of
jail.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
out
of
jail
on
appeal,
your
honor,
from
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
but
he
was
certainly
in
jail
for
at
least
two
years.
that
is
why
in
our
brief
we
stated
it
appears
he
was
possibly
incarcerated
as
long
as
four
years,
from
the
spring
of
'78
to
the
spring
of
'82.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
we
look
to
the
finding
of
a
manslaughter
conviction
before
the
circuit
court
as
the
possible
parameter,
outside
limit
of
four
years
in
jail,
which
now
in
mississippi
if
you
manslaughter
while
intoxicated,
the
maximum
sentence
is
five
years,
based
upon
the
new
statute
that
we
refer
to
in
our
brief
and
that
mr.
roberts'
attorney
refers
to
in
his
brief.
the
point
is
raised
that
the
trial
de
novo
barred
the
double
jeopardy
claim.
as
stated
in
the
discussion
with
the
court,
we
don't
think
there
was
a
trial
de
novo.
there
was
a
trial
in
justice
court
on
misdemeanors.
there
was
a
trial
in
circuit
court
on
manslaughter.
and
we
certainly
don't
think
that
bars
his
right
to
raise
his
double
jeopardy
claim.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
your
honor,
i
am
not
speaking
on
behalf
of
mr.
roberts.
i
am
speaking
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
yes,
sir.
what
happens
to
mr.
roberts
is,
if
the
petitioner
is
right
and
i
am
wrong
and
the
fifth
circuit
is
wrong,
then
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
possibly
under
some
standard,
or
if
reversed,
mr.
roberts
would
go
back
to
jail,
and--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--i
think
the
blackledge
issue
this
court
should
address.
i
think
in
fact
it
is
an
easier,
cleaner
constitutional
issue
than
the
double
jeopardy
issue
before
the
court,
because
by
analogy
this
court
seeking
to
avoid
ruling
on
constitutional
issues--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--yes,
sir,
but
it
is
a
more
difficult
constitutional
issue
it
appears
than
the
blackledge
decision.
i
don't
see
any
distinction
or
distinguishment
between
blackledge
and
this
case,
except
possibly
the
fact
that
there
were
two
different
attorneys
involved,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
although
it
appears
that
the
same
attorney,
the
county
attorney,
was
involved
throughout,
but--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--your
honor,
the
main
reason
is
because
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
who
would
be
in
charge
of
the
justice
court
case
is
also
the
attorney
that
presents
the
charges
to
the
grand
jury,
and
so
he
is
the
one
that
makes
that
decision,
will
we
indict,
and
that
would
be
the
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
that
this
court--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--a
district
attorney--
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
--a
district
attorney
is
involved,
but
the
county
attorney
is
also
involved.
he
is
responsible
for
trying
cases
in
his
county,
so
you
have
both
the
district
attorney
and
the
county
attorney
involved
in
the
manslaughter
circuit
court
case,
but
you
have
the
county
attorney
involved
in
justice
court,
you
have
the
county
attorney
involved
in
the
arraignment,
you
have
the
county
attorney
involved
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings
and
at
the
trial
in
circuit
court.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
the
district
attorney
would
have
that
ultimate
decision,
your
honor,
in
consultation
obviously
with
the
county
attorney,
who
would
obviously
have
a
lot
of
influence
with
the
district
attorney
because
it
is
his
county.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
don't
see
a
distinction,
because
as
stated
it
is
the
county
attorney's
county.
he
obviously
has
a
great
deal
of
influence
with
the
district
attorney,
and
it
is
the
institutional
bias
that
this
court
is
looking
to.
it
is
the
power
of
the
state,
not
of
these
individuals
to
indict
someone
for
a
greater
offense
after
they
seek
trial
de
novo
from
a
case
of
this
type.
mr.
rhesa
h.
barksdale
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
as
persuasive.
i
think
it
is
extremely
persuasive
because
the
county
attorney
is
involved
up
and
down
the
ladder,
and
so
is
the
district
attorney.
i
think
it
is
interesting...
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you,
your
honors.
