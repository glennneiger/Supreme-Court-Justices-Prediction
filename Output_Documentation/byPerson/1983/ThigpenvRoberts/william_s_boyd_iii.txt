mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
ultimate
question
which
we
are
here
about
today
is
to
resolve
whether
the
respondent
was
denied
his
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
he
was
indicted,
tried,
and
convicted
of
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence.
our
discussion
this
morning
will
focus
on
three
principal
areas.
the
first
is
the
appropriate
federal
or
constitutional
standard
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
two,
that
with
the
exception
of
the
denial
of
post-conviction
relief
herein,
which
was
without
opinion,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
reckless
driving
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence.
and
three,
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
misconstrued
the
law
of
the
state
of
mississippi
when
they
held
that
reckless
driving
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
death
occurred
instantaneously
with
the
accident.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
let
me
qualify
that
with
this.
it
was
initially
done
that
way
or
was
later
done
that
way
in
this
case,
that
the
justice
courts
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
which
they
were
at
the
time
of
this
case,
five
per
county,
one
for
each
supervisor's
beat,
that
the
misdemeanor
charges,
they
have
primary
jurisdiction
of
misdemeanor
charges.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
none
that
would
require
it.
however,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
reply
to
the
brief
of
amicus
in
this
matter,
that
in
stenson
v.
state,
which
has
been
recently
decided
by
our
supreme
court,
they
have
held
that
it
was
a...
that
the
conviction
was
reversible
where
the
individual
was
indicted
in
a
multi-count
indictment.
in
other
words,
we
cannot
charge
more
than
one
charge
per
indictment,
nor
can
we
try
under
stenson
more
than
one
charge
per
case
unless
it
is
with
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
which
was
done
so
in
this
case
on
appeal
from
the
misdemeanor.
so,
unlike
the
federal
government,
or
unlike
the
federal
procedure
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
we
do
not
have
a
requirement
that
all
of
the
charges
be
contained
in
one
indictment,
but
instead
it
is
just
the
opposite,
the
old
common
law
rule
that
they
have
to
be
brought
by
separate
indictment.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
ma'am.
they
are
charged
by
affidavit.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
ma'am,
that's
exactly--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--um-hm.
that--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--the
constitution
of
the
state
of
mississippi
requires
that
one
be
indicted
for
an
offense.
however,
there
is
an
exception
where
the
defendant
waives
indictment.
we
have
had
a
few
cases
of
that
nature
where
they
have...
where
the
defendant
has
come
in
and
waived
indictment
and
in
fact
pled
guilty
to
the
offense.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
there
are
preliminary
hearings
once
someone
is
arrested
on
an
arrest
warrant.
there
can
be
an
arrest
warrant
issued
by
a
magistrate,
be
it
a
justice
of
the
peace,
circuit
judge,
chancery
judge,
supreme
court
justice,
youth
court
judge,
or
whatever,
that
so
long
as
he
is
a
magistrate
or
a
judicial
officer,
he
may
issue
an
arrest
warrant.
however,
prosecutions
are
had
only
upon
indictments.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
all
right.
this
gets
into
one
particular
question
that
was
raised
by
the
briefs
in
this
case.
we
have
in
essence
or
had
at
the
time
that
this
case
came
down
four
different
types
of
prosecutors
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
we
had
municipal
prosecutors
who
were
limited
in
jurisdiction
to
the
municipalities
in
which
their
court
sat
plus
they
were
only
appointed
in
cities
where
we
had
a
population
in
excess
of
10,000.
there
are
county
prosecuting
attorneys,
which
are...
is
an
elected
position.
county
prosecuting
attorneys
have
traditionally
had
jurisdiction
in
misdemeanor
cases.
they
have
prosecuted
cases
involving
misdemeanors
in
the
justice
courts
and
in
county
courts
in
those
counties
which
have
county
courts.
they
have
assisted
the
district
attorney,
who
is
normally
elected
from
a
multi-county
district
or
a
circuit
district
in
the
state.
under
the
constitution
of
the
state,
the
district
attorney
has
primary
jurisdiction
of
all
felony
cases.
now,
in
1979,
after
this
case
was
tried,
the
mississippi
legislature
clarified
the
jurisdiction
between
all
of
these
various
and
sundry
prosecuting
authorities.
the
fourth
prosecuting
authority
is
the
attorney
general's
office.
now,
there
is
no
statutory
prohibition
which
keeps
us
from
prosecuting
in
the
circuit
courts.
however,
it
has
been
by
tradition
that
the
district
attorneys
have
that
function--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--there
is
no
statutory
prohibition
to
it.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
it
did
not
happen.
that
is
what
i
said.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
traditionally
we
have
followed
a
demarcation
of
jurisdiction
along
lines
of
municipal
attorneys
trying
municipal
offenses,
county
attorneys
trying
misdemeanor
offenses,
district
attorneys
trying
felony
cases--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--justice
court
of
beat
one,
tallahachee
county,
mississippi.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
circuit
court.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
primary
prosecutor
was
the
district
attorney.
however,
the
county
attorney
did
assist.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
his
district...
this
is,
i
believe,
the
fifteenth
judicial
district,
which
runs
from
memphis,
tennessee,
some
120
miles
south
into
the
delta
area
of
the
state.
that
i
think--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--yes,
ma'am,
it
is.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
it
is
possible.
however,
they
normally,
and
by
that
i
mean
normally,
i
mean
99.9
percent
of
the
time,
misdemeanor
charges
always
originate
in
justice
court,
that
that
is
their,
shall
we
say,
bailiwick,
that
justice
court
judges
have
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
which
involve
fines
up
to
$1,000
and
imprisonment
in
the
county
jail
for
up
to
one
year.
all
other
crimes,
the
jurisdiction
is
vested
exclusively
in
the
circuit
courts.
this
is
where
the
trial
de
novo
question
comes
in.
appeal
with
a
right
to
trial
de
novo.
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
justice
court.
you
can
have
a
jury
trial,
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
it.
now,
in
this
case,
if
i
may
summarize
the
facts
just
very
briefly
in
order
to
get
this
matter
in
the
proper
perspective,
that
on
august
6th,
1977,
barry
joe
roberts,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
was
traveling
along
mississippi
state
highway
35
between
charleston,
mississippi,
and
batesville,
mississippi.
roberts
was
headed
in
a
northerly
direction,
and
a
pickup
truck
driven
by
mary
ella
bonner
was
headed
south.
somewhere
between
these
two
cities,
in
tallahachee
county,
there
was
a
collision.
mr.
roberts
first
ran
off
the
right-hand
side
of
the
road,
then
crossed
the
median
or
center
line
in
the
road
and
hit
the
pickup
truck
head-on.
this
ten-year-old
little
girl
was
in
the
back
end
of
the
pickup
truck.
she
was
thrown
out
and
killed.
now,
as
a
result
of
this,
the
investigating
highway
patrol
officer
issued
four
citations
under
the
uniform
citation
act
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
they
were
for
driving
while...
with
a
revoked
driver's
license,
mr.
roberts
having
been
convicted
of
driving
while
intoxicated
on
a
previous
occasion,
driving
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor,
reckless
driving,
and
driving
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road.
six
days
after
the
accident,
mr.
roberts
appeared
in
justice
court.
the
honorable
sandra
b.
johnson
of
beat
one,
tallahachee
county,
mississippi--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--yes,
sir.
it
goes
back...
the
terminology
goes
back
to
the
old
police
jury
system
that
we
had
in
days
of
yore,
that
there
are
in
essence
five
supervisors'
districts
in
each
county.
these
districts
are
called
beats.
each
beat
in
1977
had
a
justice
court
judge.
we
have
since
amended
that
statute.
we
have
reduced
the
number
of
justice
court
judges
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
there
being
only
two
counties
which
have
five
now,
that
being
hines
and
harrison
counties,
the
two
largest.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
fifteenth
judicial
district,
which
encompasses
desoto,
tate,
tallahachee,
pinola,
and
yalabusha
counties.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
circuit
judge
in
that
district
lives
in
tallahachee
county,
or
one
of
them
does.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
that
is
a
matter
of
coincidence.
the
other
circuit
judge
lives
in
desoto
county,
which
is
a
good
bit
north
of
there.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
the
next
session
of
the
circuit
court...
we
have
terms
of
court.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
next
session
was
in
december.
that
is
the
next
time
that
the
grand
jury
came
into
session,
and
at
that
time
that
was
when
the
indictment
was
obtained
in
this
case
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
record
does
not
reflect
that
there
was.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
ma'am,
not
an
indictment.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
not
an
indictment.
no,
ma'am.
the
grand
jury
is
the
only
one
that
can
return
an
indictment,
and
the
grand
jury
did
not
go
into
session
until
the
first
monday
of
the
december
term.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
not
at
that
time,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
they
do
now.
in
fact,
we
have
all
but
abolished
terms
of
court
now,
and
we
have
permanent
sitting
grand
juries
for
six-month
periods,
or
at
least
they
have
got
to
call
two
grand
juries
during
a
given
calendar
year.
they
can
be
held
over
court
terms
and
things
of
this
nature.
at
that
time
they
could
not
be
held
over
a
court
term.
the
grand
jury
was
called
at
the
beginning
of
the
court
session,
and
things
of
this
nature.
now,
as
i
said,
on
august
13,
1977,
mr.
roberts
appeared
in
justice
court
of
tallahachee
county.
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
offenses
or
to
the
traffic
offenses,
immediately
perfected
an
appeal
with
a
right
to
trial
de
novo
to
the
circuit
court
of
tallahachee
county.
on
december
7,
1977,
at
the
first
grand
jury
which
was
convened
after
the
accident,
respondent
was
indicted
for
manslaughter
under
section
97.347
of
the
mississippi
code.
by
agreement
of
the
parties
in
this
case,
the
misdemeanors
were
consolidated
with
the
manslaughter
charge
for
trial.
on
may
28,
1978,
the
matter
was
called
for
trial,
but
prior
to
the
state
resting,
it
nolle
prossed
as
the
fifth
circuit
found
all
of
the
misdemeanor
charges
that
had
been
lodged
against
mr.
roberts.
neither
the
double
jeopardy
question
that
is
raised
in
this
case
nor
the
prosecutorial
vindictiveness
questions
were
raised
until
a
petition
for
post-conviction
relief
was
filed
in
november
of
1980.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
no
explanation
whatsoever.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
this
is
correct.
in
actuality
what
happened,
the
fifth
circuit
found
that
this
was
the
equivalent
of
a
nolle
pros.
we
have...
as
a
part
of
our
criminal
practice,
district
attorneys
will
ask
the
court
to
pass
something
to
the
files,
which
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
nolle
pros.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
all
right.
once
again
we
get
into
another
particular
aspect
of
mississippi
procedure.
under
section
99.35.145
of
the
mississippi
code,
we
have
a
procedure
by
which,
or
up
until
last
week
we
had
a
procedure
by
which
you
file
a
petition
or
an
application
for
leave
to
proceed
in
the
court
which
had
last
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
in
other
words,
if
you
take
an
appeal
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
then
that
is
the
court
which
had
last
jurisdiction,
and
you
file
an
application
for
leave
to
proceed
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
in
the
lower
court.
the
court
then
reviews
this
petition
to
determine
whether
or
not
probable
cause
has
been
stated
for
review.
if
probable
cause
has
not,
then
the
court
will
deny
the
application
and
there
will
be
no
remand
to
the
lower
court.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
was
what
was
filed
here.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
and
denied
without
opinion.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
and
then
into
u.s.
district
court.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
have
no
question
but
what
the
question
was
raised
under
rose
v.
lundy
to
determine
whether
or
not
exhaustion
had
taken
place.
there
is
no
question
about
exhaustion
in
this
case.
i
will
parenthetically
add
that
the
order
entered
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
recently
been
interpreted
to
include
procedural
bars,
that
is,
under
wainwright
versus
sikes
as
decided
by
this
court.
however,
at
the
time
frame
in
which
this
case
came
up,
i
must
candidly
admit
that
under
ulster
county
court
versus
allen,
the
state
did
not
proceed
under
the
theory
of
procedural
bar,
so
consequently
we
do
not
argue
it
here.
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
district
court
both
relied
on
deciding
the
double
jeopardy
question
upon
the
test
articulated
by
this
court
in
blockburger
versus
the
united
states,
the
same
evidence
test.
our
position
as
expounded
upon
by
justice
white
in
his
opinion
in
vitalli
v.
illinois
is
that
the
state
is
not
precluded
from
prosecuting
respondent
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
a
substantial
overlap
in
proof
required
to
prove
both
the
crimes
of
reckless
driving
and
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence
because
each
offense
requires
proof
of
a
statutory
element
the
other
does
not.
in
albernaz
versus
united
states,
whalen
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
indicated
that
the
test
articulated
in
blockburger
was
a
rule
of
statutory
construction.
applying
that
rule
of
statutory
construction
to
the
case
at
bar,
we
find
that
the
application
of
the
test
should
focus,
one,
upon
the
statutory
elements
of
the
offense
of
reckless
driving,
and
two,
upon
the
statutory
offense
or
the
general
catch-all
statute
of
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence.
now,
this
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
statutory
situation
in
which
we
found
in
vitalli.
in
vitalli,
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
the
reckless
use
of
an
automobile,
of
a
motor
vehicle.
we
do
not
have
that
in
this
case.
instead,
we
have
a
general
or
omnibus
statute
dealing
with
manslaughter
or
a
catch-all
statute.
they
specifically
define
various
and
sundry
forms
of
manslaughter
in
other
statutes,
and
then
say
all
other
homicides,
including
homicide
by
culpable
negligence,
shall
be
construed
as
manslaughter.
therefore,
we
find
that
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
statutory
provisions.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
think
this
is
the
whole
question
or
the
whole
thing
that
this
case
boils
down
to,
is
the
interpretation
of
this
court's
statement
of
same
evidence
or
the
same
evidence
rule.
in
reviewing
brown--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--yes,
ma'am.
well,
i
say
that,
yes,
ma'am,
in
that
the
reckless
driving
requires
an
element
that
manslaughter
does
not
require,
and
manslaughter
requires
an
element
that
reckless
driving
does
not
require.
the
problem
that
we
run
into
here
is
tantamount
to
the
situation
of
a
rico
prosecution
and
a
prosecution
for
the
substantive
offense.
in
particular,
the
fifth
circuit
has
found
in
at
least
two
cases
that
these
are
separate
and
distinct
offenses
for
which
indictments
can
be
returned,
or
that
separate
punishments
may
be
imposed.
unquestionably,
both
the
same
evidence
was
introduced,
although
he
pled
guilty
at
the
misdemeanor
case
in
the
justice
court.
the
same
evidence
would
have
been
introduced
in
both
trials,
primarily
because
both
offenses
arose
out
of
the
same
res
justi.
you
would
have
had
to
introduce
everything
in
order
to
prove
both
of
the
charges.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
that's
correct.
and
this
is
what
the
court
noted
in
brown,
in
iannelli,
and
in
vitalli.
the
court
spoke
about
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
a
substantial
overlap
in
proof
that
is
actually
offered,
that
i
think
the
court
has
envisioned
the
fact
that
you
will
often
times
have
the
same
facts
introduced.
it
is
just
what
those
facts
go
to
prove,
the
elements
that
those
facts
go
to
prove
which
are
the
distinguishing
point
in
which
the
state
intends
to
rely
in
this
case,
is
the
fact
that
because
in
the
case
of
reckless
driving
you
had
to
prove
that
you
were
driving
a
vehicle
on
the
streets
and
highways
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
an
element
you
are
not
required
to
prove--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
clarify
one
point
that
i
think
there
was
a
misunderstanding
on
my
part.
i
believe
justice
o'connor
asked
a
question.
to
clarify
a
procedural
point,
the
state
of
mississippi
could
have
indicted
mr.
roberts
at
this
time.
the
thing
about
it
is...
and
could
have
called
a
grand
jury.
the
thing
about
it
is,
this
particular
judicial
district
was
at
that
time
the
busiest
judicial
district
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
processing
over
4,000
criminal
cases
a
year.
as
a
matter
of
actual
practice,
they
did
not
call
grand
juries
except
during
the
terms
in
which
the
court
was
in
session.
in
particular,
the
court
was
in
session,
i
believe,
48
weeks
out
of
52
in
every
given
year
at
that
particular
time.
they
had
one
judge,
one
district
attorney,
and
one
assistant
district
attorney
to
handle
that
many
cases.
so,
as
a
consequence,
it
simply
was
not
done,
although
it
could
have
been
done
in
this
case.
i
want
to
direct
my
attention
here
in
the
last
few
minutes
to
two
points.
the
first
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
misconstrued
the
state...
or
the
case
of
smith
v.
state
in
this
situation.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
never
addressed
the
question
of
whether
reckless
driving
was
a
lesser
included
or
is
a
lesser
included
offense
to
the
offense
of
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence.
the
case
cited
by
the
fifth
circuit
applying
this
judicial
veneer
as
they
call
it
was
not
in
fact
a
judicial
veneer
but
was
in
fact
addressing
the
particular
facts
of
that
case
to
the
law
as
it
applied.
in
particular,
smith
v.
state
dealt
with
whether
gross
negligence
was
sufficient,
or
proof
of
gross
negligence
was
sufficient
to
prove
culpable
negligence
under
this
statute.
they
held
that
it
was
not.
we
also
note
that
the
court
has
held
that
dwi
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
to
the
crime
of
manslaughter.
that
was
in
outshall
v.
state.
finally,
we
look
to
the
legislative
intent,
following
the
albernaz
line
of
reasoning.
we
note
that
we
have
separate
statutes.
the
manslaughter
statute
was
enacted
in
1848.
the
reckless
driving
statute
was
enacted
in
1938.
manslaughter
is
contained
in
title
97
of
the
mississippi
code
dealing
with
criminal
offenses.
reckless
driving
is
in
title
63,
dealing
with
traffic
offenses.
manslaughter
carries
its
own
separate
penalty
of
up
to
20
years
maximum
in
the
state
penitentiary.
reckless
driving
has
its
own
separate
offense
or
punishment
of
ten
days
in
the
county
jail
or
a
fine
of
$500
or
both.
both
provisions
are
unambiguous.
there
is
no
legislative
history
behind
either
one
of
these
things,
so
consequently
following
the
presumption
that
this
court
discussed
in
albernaz,
we
should
presume
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
which
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
about
the
congress
is
primarily
a
lawyers'
body.
it
therefore
must
be
presumed
that
the
legislature
was
familiar
with
this
court's
doctrine
in
blockburger
versus
the
united
states
and
that
they
construed
reckless
driving
to
be
a
separate
offense
for
which
separate
punishment
could
be
imposed
other
than
in
the
manslaughter
situation.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--that
issue
was
avoided
by
the
fifth
circuit,
i
think
primarily
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
goodwin.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
as
i
say,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit,
deservedly
so,
avoided
the
issue
on
blackledge
v.
perry
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
goodwin,
and
knowing
what
the
procedural
posture
is
in
the
state
of
mississippi
in
regard
to
prosecutions.
the
magistrate's
decision
was
decided
prior
to...
or
entered
his
decision
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
goodwin
in
1981,
applying
a
per
se
rule,
which
this
court
has
since
said
in
goodwin
is
not
a
per
se
rule,
but
merely
a
presumption.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
agree.
i
don't
think
the
court
should.
i
think,
however,
because
of
the
procedural
posture
in
this
case,
that
it
would
be
the
better
course
of
action
to
remand
the
matter
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
reconsideration
on
that
point.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
no,
sir.
those
charges
could
be
rebrought
or
brought
again.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
the
statute
of
limitations
run
i
suppose
would
be
the
termination
of
those
offenses.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
to
my
knowledge.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
have
just
a
couple
of
comments.
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
yes,
the
district
attorney
is
the
one
who
has
the
ultimate
say-so
as
to
whether
or
not
someone
is
indicted
or
whether
someone
is
not
indicted
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir,
except
for
really
it
is
the
grand
jury.
to
follow
the
invitation
of
the
amicus
in
this
case
to
the
same
evidence
test
that
he
extrapolated
upon
in
argument
would
limit
the
state
of
mississippi
to
one
prosecution
and
one
prosecution
only.
our
supreme
court
has
held
as
recently
as
stenson
v.
state,
there
is
currently
a
case
that
is
pending
on
rehearing
before
that
court
on
the
same
question,
styled
young
v.
state,
to
the
effect
that
the
state
is
limited
to
a
one
count
charge,
that
we
cannot
indict
by
multi-count
indictment.
consequently,
to
follow
the
same
evidence
argument
as
advanced
by
amicus
would
limit
the
state
to
one
prosecution,
which
under
the
common
law
was
unheard
of,
and
we
submit
under
the
laws
of...
under
the
constitution
is
not
required.
the
state
is
entitled
to
indict
on
several
counts.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
believe
it
was
hicks,
your
honor.
harris
versus
oklahoma.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
that
was
also
in,
i
believe,
whalen.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
that
is
what
this
court
has
held,
but
i
think
that
case
is
distinguishable
from
this
case--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--because,
one,
you
do
not
have
to
prove
in
manslaughter
by
culpable
negligence
that
a
vehicle
was
recklessly
driven.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
but
you
can.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
not
what
this
court
has
in
my
opinion
articulated
as
the
test.
the
court
has
said
in
vitalli
that
it
does
not...
where
you
do
not
necessarily
have
to
prove
that
element.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
robbery
was
a
part
of
felony
murder
at
that
time
by
definition,
i
believe.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
we
don't
know
that
it
was
held
in
august.
that
was
when
the
affidavit
was
filed
by
the
father
of
the
child.
there
is
no
date
as
to
when
the
preliminary
hearing
was
held.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
we
don't
know
when
it
was
held.
it
could
have
been
held
in
conjunction
with
the
indictment
some
time
in
november.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
i
do
not
know
when
mr.
roberts
was--
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
--your
honor,
there
is
no
requirement...
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
be
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate,
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
a
preliminary
hearing
be
given
such
as
in
coleman.
our
preliminary
hearing
is
merely...
is
not
a...
is
a
non-binding
stage.
the
one
who
has
his
charges
dismissed
against
him
at
a
preliminary
hearing
the
grand
jury
can
later
indict
for
the
same
offense.
mr.
william
s.
boyd,
iii
yes,
sir.
