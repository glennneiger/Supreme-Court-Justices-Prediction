mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
regulation
case.
this
is
not
an
urban
land
economics
case.
this
is
a
taking
case.
this
case
will
decide,
hopefully,
if
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
satisfied
by
a
mere
legislative
declaration
that
the
taking
is
for
a
public
purpose.
and
hopefully
it
would
also
decide
whether
such
declaration
shields
the
statute
from
judicial
scrutiny
and
analysis
and,
in
a
proper
case,
from
being
declared
unconstitutional.
at
stake,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
fundamental
right
in
our
system,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
right
to
own,
use
and
possess
property
free
from
government
intervention
or
interference
so
long
as
it's
being
done
in
a
lawful
manner,
and
free
of
government
compulsion
to
transfer
it
to
another
owner
merely
because
the
public
interest,
it
is
asserted,
is
thereby
served.
this
statute
is
absolutely
unprecedented.
no
legislature
ever
before
has
been
so
bold
as
to
transfer
a
private
title
or
to
set
up
the
machinery
for
transferring
a
private
title
from
a
to
b--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--hawaii
has
somewhat
of
a
unique
land
history,
your
honor,
but
that
unique
land
history,
despite
what
mr.
tribe
says,
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
this.
if
there
is
a
concentration
of
land
in
hawaii,
it
certainly
is
no
greater
than
in
the
u.s.
as
a
whole.
and
concentration
in
any
event
is
not
going
to
be
solved
by
this
statute.
however,
our
case
doesn't
depend
upon
the
application
of
the
facts
to
it.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
yes,
justice
blackmun.
there
was
a
study
done
in
1978
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
on
land
ownership
in
the
united
states.
that
study
found,
among
other
things,
for
example,
that
less
than
half
of
one
percent
of
the
major
landowners
owned
40
percent
of
the
land.
in
hawaii
government
collectively
owns
somewhere
between
40
and
45
percent.
the
figures
are
a
little
hazy
with
regard
to
federal
ownership.
but
while
we
do
have
many
big
landowners,
we
also
have
thousands
upon
thousands
upon
thousands
of
small
landowners.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
yes,
sir.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
state
of
hawaii
could
dispose
of
state
lands
as
another
means
of
solving
these
problems
of
shortage
of
housing
and
so
forth
if
it
wanted
to.
there
are
other
means
by
which
all
of
this
could
be
accomplished.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
about
35
percent.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that's
in
the
state
as
a
whole,
and
this
statute
has
statewide
application.
it
is
not
limited
to
oahu
only.
the
procedures
used
under
this
statute
are
also
privately
controlled,
and
the
scheme
is
all
privately
financed.
if
the
statute
is
validated
by
this
court,
it
will
be
the
same
as
writing
the
public
use
requirement
out
of
the
constitution.
you
will
be
at
the
beginning
of
a
continuum
which
really
has
no
end.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
your
honor,
our
whole
point
in
being
here
is
to
urge
this
court
not
to
surrender
to
mere
legislative
declarations.
deference
may
be
due
them,
but
not
surrender.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
justice
rehnquist,
we're
not
here
to
ask
this
court
to
second-guess
the
legislature.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
would
analogize
it,
justice
rehnquist,
to
the
situation,
to
the
approach
that
this
court
takes
in
examining
regulations
to
determine
whether
those
regulations
effect
a
taking,
and
in
that
kind
of
analysis
what
the
court
does
is
to
look
at
the
impact
of
the
statute
upon
the
owner's
property.
it
measures
the
impact
on
the
value
of
the
property,
on
the
owner's
ability
to
exclude
others,
upon
his
use
of
the
property...
in
other
words,
the
aggregate--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--correct,
your
honor.
and
we
would
suggest
that
exactly
the
same
type
of
analysis
is
required
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
public
use.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that
is
precisely
our
position,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that
is
correct,
it
did.
however,
i
would
invite
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
berman
against
parker
the
taking
was
by
government
for
itself.
and
the
other
cases,
old
dominion
land
company,
tva
against
welch,
these
other
cases
which
make
the
same
kind
of
broad
statements
about
deference
to
the
congressional
determinations
or
legislative
determinations,
all
of
those,
sir,
were
cases
in
which
the
government
was
taking
the
land
for
itself
and
putting
it
to
use.
there
was
some
private
development
of
land
in
berman...
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
a
few
moments...
but
in
all
of
those
cases
where
those
statements
were
made
it
was
government
taking
it
for
itself.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
just
to
come
back
to
your
point,
sir,
justice
stewart
said
in
hughes
against
washington,
which
was
another
taking
case,
granted,
that
the
constitution
measures
the
effect
of
an
act
not
by
what
the
state
says
or
what
it
intends,
but
what
it
does.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that
was
his
concurring
opinion,
and
that
is
our
position
here.
the
public
use
requirement
and
the
just
compensation
requirement
are
two
separate
and
distinct
requirements.
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
they
must
both
be
met,
and
the
mere
statement
by
the
legislature
that
the
public
use
requirement
has
been
met
is
not
adequate.
this
court,
in
exercising
its
judicial
function--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--well,
if
this--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--our
point
is
this,
mr.
justice
white.
if
there
is
a
problem,
there's
a
legitimate
problem
to
be
solved,
the
legislature
has
the
power
to
solve
it,
but
it
must
do
so
in
a
constitutional
way.
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
this
statute
does
not
do
it
in
a
constitutional
way,
because
here
we
have
a
taking
of
title,
title
is
transferred
from
private
owner
a
to
private
owner
b,
with
the
government
intervening
solely
and
merely
as
a
conduit
in
the
passage
of
that
title.
and
irrespective
that
the
legislature
said
that
that
is
a
public
use,
all
of
the
indicia,
if
one
examines
the
statute,
collectively
demonstrate
that
it
is
purely
a
private
use.
let
me
get
to
that,
if
i
may.
there
is
an
aggregation
of
indicia
here
which
we
think,
notwithstanding
what
the
legislature
said
about
this
statute,
clearly
brands
it
as
a
taking
for
private
purposes.
the
use
and
useability
of
the
property,
first,
does
not
change.
neither
the
property
taken
nor
any
property
served
nor
the
environs,
nothing
is
changed
here.
not
even
a
change
of
possession
is
contemplated.
secondly,
this
is
a
private
transfer
from
private
owner
a
to
private
owner
b.
the
government
is
in
the
picture
solely
and
merely
as
a
conduit.
it
cannot
act
at
all
in
bringing
about
any
of
this
activity
unless
and
until
the
aggregate,
the
requisite
number
of
lessees
take
certain
action.
unless
and
until
that
happens,
the
government
can't
act
under
this
statute.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there
is
very
definitely
a
difference
between
cases
such
as
those
your
honor
mentions,
including
berman,
and
our
case,
your
honor,
because
in
those
cases
there
is
a
government
plan,
there
is
a
comprehensive
detailed
study
made
to
bring
about
a
certain
change
in
the
use
of
the
land.
the
government
then
embarks
upon
the
carrying
out
of
that
plan
and
effects
the
change
in
use.
it
happens
to
use
private
developers
to
accomplish
that,
but
the
plan
is
to
change
the
use
in
the
property,
and
it's
merely
the
means
of
carrying
that
out
that
involves
a
private
title.
here
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
vest
private
title
in
the
lessees,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
beyond
that
there
is
no
government
control,
no
regulation
whatever.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
justice
o'connor,
i
am
not
an
antitrust
lawyer,
but
my
understanding
of
antitrust
remedies
are
that,
even
with
divestiture,
the
private
owner
is
given
an
opportunity
over
a
period
of
time
to
get
rid
of
the
title.
he
is
able
to
do
that
in
a
free
market.
he
is
not
limited
to
selling
it
to
one
person.
there
are
many
differences
between
what
a
person
is
forced
to
do
under
divestiture
and
what
this
statute
forces
a
person
to
do,
which
is
to
sell
to
one
person
only,
upon
his
application,
using
his
money.
that's
another
element
of
the
statute
that
i'd
like
to
invite
to
the
court's
attention.
in
this
whole
scheme,
not
only
the
costs
of
the
condemnation
proceeding,
but
all
of
the
compensation
is
paid
by
the
private
party
who
ends
up
with
the
title.
in
the
redevelopment
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
do
have
the
government
at
least
paying
the
compensation
and
then
getting
back
the
money.
here
the
compensation
is
all
paid
by
the
lessees.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
under
this
statute?
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
theoretically
you
could,
justice
o'connor.
but
the
whole
policy
of
the
statute
is
to
pass
the
title
through
the
government
to
the
lessees.
a
question
was
asked
of
mr.
tribe
on
this
point.
justice
brennan
asked
it,
i
believe,
and
the
statute
when
it
talks
about
using
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
acquire
the
title
says
in
the
very
same
section,
which
is
516-22,
that
this
chapter
is
to
govern
the
disposition
of
that
title.
and
in
section
516-28
it
is
stated:
"it
shall
be
the
policy
of
the
hawaii
housing
authority
to
encourage
the
widespread
fee
simple
ownership
of
residential
lots.
"
all
of
the
findings,
and
indeed
all
of
the
operations,
of
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
government
will
be
merely
a
conduit
in
the
passage
of
title
from
private
party
a
to
the
private
lessee.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there
hasn't
been
any
question
raised
as
to
how
the
statute
does
in
fact
operate
that
i
am
aware
of,
justice
o'connor.
and
the
basic
core
question
here
is
is
this
a
public
use.
the
legislature
declared
it
to
be,
we
concede
that.
but
it
is
a
judicial
function
to
declare
the
public
use.
if
the
legislature
is
permitted
to
itself
define
constitutional
limits
on
its
own
power,
then
those
limits
no
longer
have
any
meaning.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
because
of
the
aggregate
of
the
methods
under
which
this
statute--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--but
that
is
just
compensation
only.
that
is
not
public
use.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that
as
a
public
purpose,
but
under
this--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--because
under
this
statute
and
under
the
constitution
you
cannot
constitutionally
accomplish
that
purpose
by
taking
a's
property
and
giving
it
to
b,
and
that
is
the
core
of
what
the
case
is
about.
in
this
case,
that
is
all
that
happens,
a's
property
is
taken
and
is
given
to
b.
there
is
no--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--if
the
court
please,
a
legitimate
purpose
must
be
accomplished
by
lawful
constitutional
means.
assuming
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose
here,
our
challenge
to
the
statute
is
the
means
by
which
it
is
carried
out,
because
it
fails
to
recognize
the
public
use
limitation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that
public
use
limitation
does
not
permit
a
legislature
to
behave
as
this
legislature
has
behaved.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there's
more
to
it
than
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
but
the
railroad
is
in
effect
similar
to
government
itself.
it
is
a
regulated
entity,
and
through
the
regulation
of
that
entity
the
public
continues
to
have
some
interest
and
some
control
over
the
situation.
in
this
situation
there
is
no
control
whatsoever
by
the
public
or
by--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
am
only
aware
of
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
validated
such
takings,
your
honor.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there
are
differences
between
those
cases
and
this,
because
it
is
not
merely
a
private
party
ending
up
with
title,
as
in
the
cases
that
you
mentioned,
but
in
this
case
the
taking
is
initiated,
financed
and
controlled
by
the
private
party.
there
is
no
government
intervention
whatsoever
except
to
act
as
the
conduit
for
passage
of
title.
there
is
no
government
plan,
predetermined
plan
to
be
followed.
there
is
no
restriction
upon
the
use
of
the
property
once
it
has
been
transferred.
these
elements
collectively
demonstrate
in
our
view
that
this
is
purely
a
private
taking.
indeed,
any
public
benefit
that
arises
from
this
arises
only
incidentally
to
the
party,
the
private
party
who
initiates
the
condemnation,
who
identifies
the
property,
and
who
pays
for
it,
ending
up
owning
it
and
using
it,
and
there
is
no
change
in
use
whatsoever.
the
kinds
of
cases
which
your
honor
is
referring
to
i
think
are
those
in
which
there
is
a
de
minimis
taking
and
in
which
either
or
both
of
the
property
taken
and
the
property
served
by
the
taking
will
have
their
uses
changed
and
would
become
more
productive
and
more
useful
to
the
economy.
there's
nothing
of
that
nature
whatsoever
in
this
case.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
in
that
situation
you
have
a
scheme,
your
honor,
which
is
wrought
by
government,
if
you
will,
and
employed
and
brings
about
certain
changes
in
land
use,
and
it
makes
otherwise
worthless
land
productive,
and
that
is
deemed
to
be
useful
to
the
economy.
that
is
the
justification
for
those
drainage--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--justice
white,
in
this
case
we
end
up
with
a
multiplicity
of
owners,
but
we
don't
end
up
with
a
multiplicity
of
new
uses
or
any
new
productiveness
or
anything
of
that
nature,
as
always
occurs--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--all
of
these
properties
are
fully
developed,
mr.
chief
justice.
indeed,
only
fully
developed
properties
can
be
taken
under
this
statute.
only
those
properties
on
which
the
taking
parties
already
own
houses,
and
that
is
the
only
kind
of
property
that
can
be
reached
under
this
statute.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--well,
the
property
is
now
freely
alienable,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are...
the
leasehold
title
and
the
fee
simple
title
are
separated
and
they're
held
by
different
parties,
but
each
of
those
titles
is
fully
alienable.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
we
think
that
the
purposes
were
irrational,
and
the
means
that
they
chose
to
carry
out
those
purposes
were
irrational,
but
our
case
does
not
depend
upon
that.
that
is
a
portion
of
our
due
process
argument.
the
core
of
the
case
is,
if
the
legislature
declares
it
to
be
a
public
use,
does
this
court
just
accept
that
or
does
this
court
make
its
own
inquiry?
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
that
would
be
a
regulation.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
if,
your
honor,
there
was
a
legitimate
objective
to
be
served
by--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--and
they've
chosen
a
means
which
is
reasonably
calculated
to
lead
to
that
end,
and
i
would
say
it
would
be
constitutional.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
but
a
due
process
test
is
not
the
only
test
that
needs
to
be
applied
here.
we
have
a
specific
constitutional
limitation.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there
is
a
requirement
also
for
public
use,
and
it's
our
position
that
the
public
use
requirement
is
not
met
when
you
have
a
taking
merely
from
a
to
b
with--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--the
difference
is
in
the
fact
that
there
is
an
express
public
use
requirement
which
must
be
met.
that
express
requirement
is
not
an
integral
part
so
far
as--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--that
is
what
the
statute
in
effect
does.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
but
your
example
i
think,
your
honor,
was
a
bit
different,
because
you
were
taking
about
the
property
being
sold
to
a
wide
variety
of
people
and
not
to
the
particular
person
who
was
residing
on
it.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
very
good
question,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
that
would
be,
notwithstanding
it's
called
a
regulation,
that
it
in
fact
is
a
taking,
and
then
if
so--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--but
nevertheless,
there's
a
mandatory
obligation
to
sell.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
and
that
could
constitute
a
taking,
and
if
so
then
you
have
to
have
a
public
use,
and
your
hypothetical
assumes
a
legitimate
public
use.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
we
don't
concede
to
that
as
a
public
use,
if
the
court
please.
i'd
like
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
on
berman
against
parker,
because
it
is
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
it
does
not
control
this
case.
in
that
case
there
was
a
tract
identified
by
a
government
agency.
here
the
tract
to
be
taken
or
the
land
to
be
taken
is
identified
by
the
private
party
who
ends
up
with
the
title.
in
berman
against
parker
the
condemnation
was
initiated,
controlled
and
paid
for
by
a
government
agency.
none
of
those
circumstances
exist
in
the
current
case.
in
berman
against
parker,
there
was
a
predetermined
comprehensive
plan
for
redevelopment
of
these
areas.
that
plan
was
contributed
to
by
three
separate
public
agencies:
the
national
capital
planning
commission,
the
district
of
columbia
commissioners,
and
the
district
of
columbia
redevelopment
land
agency.
here
the
hha
is
involved
solely
as
a
conduit
for
title.
there
were
massive
changes
in
use
to
be
accomplished
through
the
redevelopment
plans.
delapidated
old
buildings
were
to
be
torn
down,
open
spaces
were
to
be
created,
slums
were
to
be
eliminated,
new
buildings
were
to
be
constructed.
the
entire
environment
of
the
property
taken
and
the
property
surrounding
it
was
to
be
totally
changed.
in
our
situation,
nothing
happens.
the
lessee
presumably
stays
in
possession
or,
if
he
wants
to,
he
can
lease
to
someone
else
or
he
can
sell
the
place,
all
without
any
control
by
government
at
all.
the
ten-year
limitation,
incidentally,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
applies
only
if
the
government
supplies
the
funds
which
the
lessee
uses
to
purchase
the
property.
absent
government
funds
being
supplied
and
borrowed
by
the
lessee,
which
has
not
happened
in
any
case,
as
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates,
the
ten-year
limitation
does
not
apply.
so
that
the
private
owner
who
supplies
the
funds
can
do
as
he
will
with
the
property
with
only
one
other
exception,
and
that
is
if
he
chooses
to
lease
it
for
more
than
20
years
it
brings
it
back
under
the
operation
of
the
act.
but
absent
that
one
single
exception,
there
is
no
control
over
the
use
of
the
property.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
there
have
been
so-called
"friendly
condemnations",
as
the
record
reflects,
where
owners
did
go
through
the
court
process
and
there
were
transfers
made.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
no,
i
mean,
your
honor,
that
the
haa,
the
taking
agency,
and
the
party
whose
property
was
taken
agreed
beforehand
upon
the
taking
and
the
price
to
be
paid
and
so
forth,
and
that's
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
of
kohatsu.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
any
mystery
about
what
happened
to
them?
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
know
in
some
takings,
in
some
transfers
by
my
client
on
agreed
upon
prices
with
lessees
outside
of
the
operation
of
this
act,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
resales
of
these
same
properties.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
it
has.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
it
has.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
it
has.
i
refer
to
wai-kahala
in
particular.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
it
hasn't
operated
to
lower
them,
sir.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
a
logical
conclusion,
your
honor.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
yes,
there
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
the
hawaiian
situation,
your
honor,
is
entirely
different,
because
when
the
sales
were
made
here
in
washington,
d.c.--
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
--i
think
it
is
entirely
different
in
principle,
because
there
were
massive
changes
in
use
of
the
property.
you
had
slums
eliminated,
new
conditions
created,
and
so
forth.
nothing
of
that
nature
is
taking
place
under
this
statute.
the
only
thing
that
happens
is
that,
instead
of
one
owner,
you're
going
to
have
several
hundred
or
even
several
thousand
owners.
there's
a
change
in
ownership,
but
there
is
no
change
in
use
or
useability
of
the
property,
and
nothing
happens
other
than
a
has
the
title
instead
of
b
having
it.
and
that
is
what
makes
this
case
so
very
different.
there
is
no
government
plan
beforehand.
there
is
no
continuing
government
oversight
or
control,
and
none
of
the
property
is
directly
used
for
public
purposes
such
as
schools
or
parks
or
whatever,
in
the
case
of
these
redevelopment
plans.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
all
of
these
have
taken
place,
according
to
my
understanding,
justice
white,
under
rulings
from
the
internal
revenue
service
which
have
not
taxed
the
proceeds
as
ordinary
income.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
think
that
they
will
not
be.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
i
think
that
they
have
not
been
and
that
they
will
not
be,
if
the
act
is
validated.
mr.
clinton
r.
ashford
no,
capital
gain.
i
think
that
they
will
not
be
taxed
as
straight
income,
but
they
will
be
taxed
as
capital
gains.
now,
the
point
has
been
made
that
my
clients
urged
the
legislature
to
arrive
at
this
result.
but
if
you're
confronted
by
a
thug
and
said
that
you're
going
to
get
a
terrible
heating,
shall
i
use
a
two
by
four
or
a
steel
pipe,
well,
obviously
you're
going
to
select
the
two
by
four.
this
is
a
choice
merely
of
lesser
evils.
thank
you.
