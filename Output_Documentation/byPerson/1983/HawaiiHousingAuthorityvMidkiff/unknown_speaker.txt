unknown
speaker
precisely
when
does
title
pass
to
the
lessee?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
is
valuation?
when
is
the
valuation
completed?
unknown
speaker
before
title
passes?
unknown
speaker
when
is
it
paid?
when
is
compensation
paid?
unknown
speaker
but
after
the
authority
takes
title,
the
valuation
has
been
fixed
and
the
money's
been
paid,
when
does
the
title
pass
to
the
tenant?
unknown
speaker
presumably?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said,
i
think,
that
the
landowner
is
only
one
of
a
group
of
25
or
whatever
that
number
is.
unknown
speaker
but
he
may
end
up
not
ever
getting
title?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
agency
just
doesn't
want
now
to
sell
to
him?
then
what?
unknown
speaker
and
lease
it
to
somebody
else?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
agency
could
just
hang
on
until
they
can
get
a
better
price
than
the
valuation
put
on
in
the
condemnation
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
take
it
if
the
occupant
finally
acquired
title
to
the
land,
he
could
sell
it?
unknown
speaker
no
limitations
whatever?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
say
the
operation
of
the
statute
has
simply
been
suspended
pending
the
result
of
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
professor
tribe,
i
may
be
mistaken,
but
i
thought
there
was
one
exception,
and
that
was
if
the
tenant
ultimately
acquired
the
property
he
could
not
sell
within
ten
years.
unknown
speaker
there
is
that
exception?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
which
limits
the
time
that
the
hha
can
hold?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
does
the
act
apply
to
the
undeveloped
tracts
of
land
that
these
group
of
landowners
refuse
to
sell?
unknown
speaker
if
it
did,
would
you
have
the
same
arguments?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
have
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
hawaii
now
is
all
the
vacant
land
that
was
available
now
used
up,
that
is
available
for
individual
single
family
dwellings?
unknown
speaker
is
it
pretty
well
exhausted?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
they
don't,
as
long
as
they
don't
the
available
land
is
now
taken
up
for
single
family
dwellings?
unknown
speaker
and
what
percentage
of
the
single
family
residential
ownership
is...
or
residential
units
is
made
up
of--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
we're
talking
only
about
oahu?
unknown
speaker
is
it
different
on
hawaii
and
kaui?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
problem
is
quite
different
in
the
other
islands,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
oahu
have
half
of
the
total
population?
unknown
speaker
is
33
percent
or
30
percent,
is
that
normally
what
standards
are
for
moving
into
oligopoly?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
just
suggested
to
me
that
the
act
doesn't
even
purport
to
deal
with
the
land
that
is
just
undeveloped.
unknown
speaker
is
that
part
of
the
findings?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
public
purpose
should
the
court
look
at
all
at
the
fact
that
only
the
application
of
private
individuals
can
trigger
the
effectiveness
of
this
act--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
should
be
possibly
an
important
factor?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
in
the
grendel's
den
case
we
had
to
look
behind
the
actual
ostensible
purpose
to
determine
whether
it
was
in
fact
a
secular
purpose
by
the
effectiveness
of
the
church
involvement,
did
we
not?
unknown
speaker
certainly
this
involves
exclusive
power
in
a
private
individual
to
trigger
the
operation
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
public
purpose
requirement
requires
or
carries
with
it
any
requirement
that
the
public
purse
be
at
risk?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
sensible
sort
of
a
safeguard
against
a
majoritarian
taking?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tribe,
you're
pretty
half-hearted
about
the
abstention
doctrine.
basically,
if
we'll
rule
for
you
on
the
merits
you
want
us
to
say
abstention
was
not
required,
but
if
we're
inclined
to
doubt
you
on
the
merits
you
want
us
to
go
back
and
say
the
court
should
abstain.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
suggested
earlier
that
there
are
so
many
uncertainties
about
this
statute
and
the
whole
scheme
that
we
ought
to
wait
until
we
hear
from
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
don't?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
it's
presently
pending
in
the
hawaiian
supreme
court,
that
you
were
going
to
urge
upon
us
was
reason
enough
for
our
insisting
on
abstention.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
factual
setting
in
our
whole
system
that's
comparable
to
the
situation
in
hawaii
in
terms
of
land?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
your
comment
about
it
being
no
greater
a
concentration
than
in
the
u.s.
as
a
whole.
would
you
expand
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
really
compare
federal
lands
on
that
percentage
with
the
land
owned
by
this
trust?
federal,
congress
could
dispose
of
that
in
any
way
they
wanted,
the
federal
lands.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
doing
it
all
the
time
over
the
years,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
the
land
is
owned
by
the
state
of
hawaii?
unknown
speaker
on
oahu?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
any
of
our
cases
suggest
that
the
public
use
requirement
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
anything
more
than
what
the
legislature
says
it
is?
unknown
speaker
but
what
cases
do
you
have
in
mind
from
this
court
that
say
this
court
should
in
effect
second-guess
the
legislature
as
to
a
public
use?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
say
that
this
court
may
say
that
something
said
by
the
legislature
is
a
public
use
is
not
in
fact
a
public
use?
unknown
speaker
to
decide
whether
there's
been
a
taking.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
that
follows
at
all.
i
think
the
guts
of
the
fifth
amendment
condemnation
clause
is
to
guarantee
that
where
there
has
been
a
taking
the
owner
gets
fair
compensation,
and
that
isn't
even
an
issue
here,
that
these
owners
are
going
to
get
fair
compensation.
you
want
us
to
go
further
and
say
that
even
where
fair
compensation
is
paid,
the
state
can't
condemn
unless
the
courts
agree
with
the
legislature's
assessment
of
public
purpose,
and
i
don't
think
any
of
our
cases
support
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
actually,
though,
mr.
ashford,
didn't
berman
and
parker
say
explicitly
that
review
of
a
legislative
determination
of
public
use
is
at
best
an
extremely
narrow
one?
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
joined
him
in
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
legislature
said
more
than
that.
it
said
there's
a
public
use
and
here's
what
it
is,
and
they
said
what
it
is.
and
what's
wrong
with
that
declared
purpose?
unknown
speaker
you
say...
it
certainly
is
a
reason.
you
just
say
it's
not
an
adequate
reason
for
taking
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
statement
about
the
government
being
a
conduit,
wasn't
that
true
in
every
one
of
the
cases,
not
here,
not
in
this
court
that
i'm
aware
of,
where
there
was
a
waterfront
clearance
or
a
slum
clearance?
the
land
was
condemned
for
a
declared
public
purpose
and
then
was
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
some
time
later
on.
it
went
directly
from
private
to
private,
through
the
government.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ashford,
aren't
typical
antitrust
divestiture
orders
just
orders
that
you
take
from
a
to
give
to
b,
two
private
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
theoretically,
i
guess
you
could
have
a
situation
where
the
private
lessee
didn't
end
up
paying
the
bill
and
the
government
agency
continued
to
hold
the
property,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
an
argument
in
favor
of
abstention,
to
let
the
state
courts
decide
the
operation
of
the
statute
or
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
that
declared
purpose?
it
wants
to
spread
out
the
ownership
of
residential
property.
now,
certainly
that's
going
to
be
the
effect
of
the
statute.
there's
going
to
be
more
people
owning
residential
property
than
there
were
before.
why
shouldn't
that
qualify
as
a
public
purpose?
unknown
speaker
the
owner
who
has
to
sell
gets
his
money
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
i
understand
that.
what's
wrong
with
spreading
the
ownership
of
residential
property
as
a
public
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
the
case
over,
then?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
for
the
purpose
of
spreading
the
ownership
of
residential
real
estate.
now
what's
wrong
with
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
just
going
to
be
your
syllogism,
how
come
it's
a
public
use
for
a
railroad
to
be
able
to
go
out
and
condemn
property
of
a
private
person,
and
the
title
goes
directly
from
one
private
person
to
another?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
public
purpose.
the
reason
they're
doing
it
is
to
promote
transportation
and
railroads.
unknown
speaker
how
about
your
common
law
easement
of
necessity?
unknown
speaker
where
a
person
who
owns
a
parcel
of
property
which
has
no
access
to
a
public
road
is
entitled
under
many
circumstances
to
condemn
an
access,
one
private
owner
condemn
an
access
through
another
private
owner's
property
in
order
to
get
himself
to
a
public
road.
i
don't
know
if
it's
universally
true.
it
certainly
was
in
the
place
where
i
practiced.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
if
something
was
uniformly
subscribed
to
at
common
law
in
england
and
in
many
states
in
this
country
it
needs
this
court
to
validate
it,
to
call
it
an
accepted
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
a
group
of
farmers
out
west
form
an
irrigation
company
and
their
object
is
to
build
some
ditches
and
a
reservoir
and
irrigate
their
farm,
and
when
that
company
gets
formed
it
suddenly
has
the
power
to
condemn
property,
and
it
takes
property
from
various
people
for
the
benefit
of
this
group
of
farmers.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
very
far
from
saying
we
ought
to
have...
we
ought
to
spread
the
ownership
of
residential
property?
it
might
improve
the
market.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
a
much
less
cluttered
use
and
ownership,
is
it
not?
isn't
there
a
difference
as
to
whether
people
are
likely
to
develop
property
when
they
have
this
limitation
of
very
limited
ownership?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
that
there
is
a
state
purpose,
a
public
purpose
in
trying
to
take
some
of
these
fetters
off
of
the
ownership?
unknown
speaker
then
are
you
suggesting
that
the
purposes
of
the
legislature
were
not
rational?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
sort
of
a
modified
question.
supposing
the
hawaiian
legislature
amended
the
antitrust
law
for
the
state
of
hawaii
to
provide
that
no
person
may
own
more
than
ten
percent
of
the
real
estate
on
which
single
family
dwellings
are
located,
thereby
intending
to
increase
competition
in
the
sale
of
real
estate,
as
you
do
here.
would
that
be
unconstitutional
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
it
would
accomplish
precisely
the
same
purpose
as
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
objective
is
to
increase
the
ownership
of
real
estate
and
improve
the
competition
in
the
market
for
single
family
lots.
unknown
speaker
isn't
this
means
reasonably
calculated
to
lead
to
that
end?
unknown
speaker
no,
there's
not
a
limitation.
there's
a
requirement
that
when
it's
done
in
this
way
you
must
pay
just
compensation.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
example,
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
contemplated
that
all
the
sales
would
be
to
other
private
purchasers,
and
i
go
farther
and
say
that
the
statute
only
be
enforceable
by
the
suit
of
a
private
party,
as
you
have
under
the
antitrust
laws
an
individual
can
bring
suit.
i
don't
see
much
difference
between
the
two
laws
in
terms
of
public
purpose.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
withdraw
your
objection
if
this
statute
said
you
must
sell
your
land
to
the
present
owner?
it
will
not
be
taken
by
the
state,
but
you
must
sell
directly
to
them
at
a
fair
market
value.
then
you
have
no
objection?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
but
my
example...
you
said
there's
no
problem
with
my
example
and
my
example
would
require
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
statute
said
the
owner
must
sell
off
parcels
of
real
estate
to
the
present
occupants
until
his
ownership
is
reduced
to
no
more
than
ten
percent
of
the
total
acreage
in
the
state.
unknown
speaker
no
state
money
involved,
no
state
involvement
at
all
except
as
a
referee
on
the
price,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
until
you
reach
the
ceiling.
unknown
speaker
the
very
public
use
that
the
hawaiian
legislature
found
to
exist
in
this
case.
that's
what
i
assumed.
unknown
speaker
was
this
act
challenged
just
as
soon
as
the
first
application
was
made,
or
have
there
been
a
lot
of
transfers
under
this
act?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
call
it
"friendly"?
you
mean
the
act
was
just
operating
like
it
was
supposed
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
then
is
there
any
history
about
what
happened
to
the
lots?
unknown
speaker
any
history,
history.
do
you
know
what
happened
to
those
lots?
unknown
speaker
and
has
the
price
generally
escalated--
unknown
speaker
--or
gone
down?
unknown
speaker
gone
up?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ashford...
go
ahead.
so
that...
so
that
this
present
system
that
the
act
attacks,
it
hasn't
operated
to
raise
real
estate
prices?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
as
soon
as
the
lots
are
sold
the
price
goes
up,
the
old
system
certainly
didn't
escalate
the
price.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
market
power.
mr.
ashford,
i
suppose
there
have
been
a
number
of
friendly
accommodations
or
uses
of
this
statute
because
of
the
attractive
tax
benefits
of
the
condemnation
system,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ashford,
let
me
try
again
as
to
how
you
would
distinguish
what
took
place
right
here
in
washington.
there
were
whole
areas
of
washington
that
were
terribly
run
down
and
they
were
condemned.
i've
forgotten
the
details
about
the
housing
authority,
but
they
were
condemned
and
taken...
the
same
was
true
down
on
the
waterfront...
and
then
sold
to
private
parties.
do
you
think
this
purpose
in
hawaii
is
less
a
public
purpose
than
the
purpose
of
eliminating
slums?
unknown
speaker
i
realize
it's
quite
different,
but
is
it
different
in
principle,
in
terms
of
the
public
nature
of
the
purpose
declared?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
in
the
few
cases,
in
these
friendly
suits
or
friendly
sales?
has
the
internal
revenue
service
insisted
on
taxing
the
proceeds
at
straight
income
tax
rates?
unknown
speaker
so
that
i
suppose
if
your
clients
were
forced
to
sell
a
lot
of
these,
many,
many
lots
under
this
act...
suppose
the
act
is
uphold,
so
that
there'll
be
hundreds
of
lots
sold
under
this.
do
you
know,
is
it
predictable
that
the
proceeds
will
not
be
taxed
as
capital
gain?
unknown
speaker
not
be
taxed--
unknown
speaker
--you
mean
taxed
as
what,
income
or--
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
the
putative
condemned
asked
for
in
pennsylvania
coal
against
mahon.
