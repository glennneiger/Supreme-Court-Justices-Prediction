mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
tests
the
limits
of
federal
judicial
intervention
into
the
legislative
and
the
judicial
processes
of
a
state
that
has
grappled
since
entering
the
union
with
a
land
oligopoly
traceable
to
its
monarchy,
very
much
as
the
original
13
colonies
struggled
with
large
landholdings
traceable
to
the
english
crown.
now,
hawaii's
legislature
attacked
that
problem
by
using
eminent
domain
with
fair
compensation,
the
approach
that
the
appellees
themselves
preferred
for
federal
tax
reasons,
but
an
approach
that
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
denounced
as
forbidden
taking
from
one
private
party
to
benefit
another,
as
though
the
land
reform
act
somehow
left
the
land
market
of
hawaii
itself
completely
unchanged
and
merely
substituted
a
favored
group
of
lessees
for
the
bishop
estate
and
other
supposedly
disfavored
owners
as
the
ruling
oligopolist
of
the
hawaiian
islands.
now,
i
should
like
to
begin
by
showing
how
wholly
untenable
that
view
is.
the
appellees
talk
repeatedly,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit,
of
appeasing
the
desires
for
land
owning
of
the
landless
majority.
as
i
think
it
will
become
clear,
that
radically
distorts
the
aims
of
the
legislation
before
this
court.
but
it
does,
perhaps
inadvertently,
hit
upon
a
very
fundamental
truth,
and
that
is
that
people
everywhere
greatly
prefer
to
own
not
only
the
home
they
live
in
and
invest
in
and
build,
but
also
the
land
on
which
that
home
stands.
now,
of
course
there
are
unusual
circumstances...
and
his
court
has
seen
some
of
them...
that
might
lead
a
perfectly
well
functioning
land
market
to
separate
surface
from
subsurface
ownership,
to
separate
the
ownership
of
the
home
on
top
of
the
land
from
the
ownership
of
what's
under
the
land.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
pennsylvania
coal
against
mahon,
where
the
land
contained
valuable
minerals,
the
perfectly
natural
development
was
for
a
few
large
mining
companies
to
end
up
owning
the
mining
rights
under
very
large
tracts
of
land,
and
selling
only
surface
rights
to
a
large
number
of
individual
homeowners.
but
of
course,
in
most
places,
both
in
the
continental
united
states
and
in
hawaii,
a
normally
functioning
competitive
market
would
never
yield
so
bizarre
a
pattern,
where
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
individual
homeowners
are
forced
to
build
on
top
of
land
that
they
must
rent
half
a
century
at
a
gulp,
despite
the
fact
that
they
want
to
buy
that
land
at
what
a
court
would
approve
as
fair
market
value
and
are
able
to
do
so.
the
situation
is
that
a
small
number
of
owners
simply
refuse
to
sell,
and
indeed
those
owners,
as
the
record
unmistakeably
shows,
keep
even
more
land
off
the
residential
market
altogether,
despite
the
great
demand.
now,
one
might
ask,
why
did
this
happen
in
hawaii
if
it
doesn't
happen
elsewhere?
the
legislature
asked
that
question
and,
after
extensive
hearings,
reached
the
conclusions
elaborately
articulated
in
1967
and
reaffirmed
in
1975
that
there
were
in
hawaii
crucial
artificial
deterrents
to
the
normal
functioning
of
the
market,
deterrents
to
the
landowners
selling
the
land
that
those
who
lived
on
top
of
it
wanted
to
buy.
those
deterrents
included
trust
indentures
inherited
from
the
hawaiian
monarchs.
they
included
as
a
very
practical
and
crucial
matter
federal
tax
disincentives,
because
the
irs
made
very
clear
to
the
major
landowners
that
were
they
to
sell
in
large
quantities
they
would
be
treated
as
ordinary
dealers
in
real
estate
and
would
be
taxed
at
ordinary
income
rates
on
virtually
100
percent
of
the
proceeds.
now,
that
alone
would
not
produce
this
bizarre
pattern
were
it
not
also
for
the
shortage
of
nearby
competitors
with
land
to
sell.
that
is,
whatever
the
disincentives
of
the
large
landowners,
if
there
were
adjacent
landowners
who
for
some
reason
were
perfectly
happy
to
meet
consumer
preferences
for
a
house
on
top
of
the
land
and
the
land
beneath
as
well,
then
this
pattern
would
not
have
developed.
but
here,
as
the
legislature
found,
there
was
a
shortage
of
alternative
competitors,
and
indeed,
unlike
some
of
the
early
american
colonies,
those
that
did
not
directly
break
up
major
landholdings
from
the
crown
but
nonetheless
found
the
holdings
dissolved
through
natural
forces
because
people
could
just
cross
the
border
and
go
to
a
place
where
they
could
buy
the
land
under
their
homes,
that
wasn't
exactly
available
because
crossing
the
border
plunks
you
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
so
that
was
the
situation
that
the
legislature
confronted,
and
it
found
specifically
that
this
land
oligopoly
would
not
just
naturally
fade
away;
that
indeed
it
would
persist
because
of
these
artificial
deterrents
to
sale;
that
it
would
keep
forcing
up
land
prices
and
lease
rents
and
the
cost
of
living
generally,
with
grave
economic
and
social
consequences
for
the
entire
state,
unless
the
oligopoly
was
somehow
broken
up
by
law.
now,
it
was
against
that
background
that
the
hawaii
land
reform
act
was
passed.
as
a
brief
reading
of
it
will
make
plain
to
the
court,
it
does
not
simply
substitute
a
favored
for
a
disfavored
group
of
owners.
what
it
does
is
create
a
neutral
mechanism
for
identifying
where
it
is
that
the
land
oligopoly
was
actually
causing
demonstrable,
palpable
market
failure.
the
concept
of
this
act
is
that
such
market
failure
is
identifiable
where
large
development
tracts
are
available
only
in
the
form
of
long-term
leasehold
of
the
underlying
land,
despite
the
willingness
and
ability
of
a
sufficiently
large
number
of
small
lot
lessees
to
buy
individual
lots
at
fair
prices.
that
is,
where
you
have
lessees
who
want
to
buy
at
fair
prices,
but
all
they
can
get
is
long-term
leaseholds
in
part
of
a
large
tract,
there
is
a
demonstrable
market
failure.
now,
how
would
a
legislature
try
to
figure
out
when
that
had
occurred?
well,
presumably
it
would
wait
for
applications
by
lessees
to
say,
we're
able
and
willing
to
buy,
but
we're
unable
to
do
it
because
the
sellers
will
not
sell.
and
that's
the
way
this
act
works.
that
is,
a
number
of
lessees,
25
or
half
the
number
in
the
tract,
whichever
is
less,
file
an
application
with
the
hawaii
housing
authority.
that
application
is
a
signal
that
the
market
has
indeed
failed,
as
the
legislature
predicted
it
would
throughout
the
islands.
at
that
point
the
act
relies
on
a
state
agency,
the
hawaii
housing
authority,
to
decide
whether
or
not
condemning
all
or
part
of
the
tract
in
question
would
serve
the
public
purpose
of
creating
a
competitive
land
market,
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes...
and
i
suppose
that
it
ordinarily
would
be,
but
one
can't
tell
because
this
is
a
facial
attack
on
the
law
and
the
law
has
only
begun
to
be
applied.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
the
hawaii
housing
authority
takes
all
or
part
of
the
tract...
it
decides
which
part...
by
eminent
domain.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
under
that
scheme,
title
passes
from
the
landowner
to
the
hawaii
housing
authority
at
the
time
a
judgment
is
made
condemning
the
land,
but
it
does
not
pass
at
that
stage,
justice
brennan.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
valuation
process
is
determined
by
a
jury
trial,
and
the
jury
trial
occurs
before
title
passes.
the
jury
trial
occurs
to
decide
how
much
money
must
be
paid
as
fair
compensation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
before
title
passes.
and
when
that
fair
compensation
has
been
determined,
then
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--compensation
is
paid
after
the
trial
to
determine
what
a
fair
amount
of
compensation
would
be.
at
that
point,
the
hawaii
housing
authority
takes
title.
and
it's
at
that
point,
justice
brennan,
that
a
very
distorted
picture
of
the
act
is
presented
by
the
appellees.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
may
never
pass
to
the
tenant.
under
the
act
as
written,
the
hawaii
housing
authority
under
section
515,
parts
28
and
31,
may
hold
title,
may
choose
to
lease
the
property,
may
put
it
up
for
public
bidding.
but
if
the
tenant
has
qualified
and
is
able
to
pay
and
does
not
own
another
nearby
tract,
then
the
tenant
presumably
has
priority
and--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
because
the
statute
is
not
entirely
clear
on
that
subject,
and
on
its
face
the
statute
suggests,
although
its
purposes
i
think
would
best
be
served
by
giving
priority
to
the
tenant,
the
statute
really
places
discretion
in
the
state
to
decide
how
best
to
dispose
of
the
now
disaggregated
landholdings,
and
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
circumstances
changed
and
that
the
landowner
no
longer
wants
to
purchase
or
no
longer
can
purchase,
because
his
eligibility
must
be
determined
both
when
the
land
is
designated--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that
i
would
argue
that
the
agency
doesn't
have
unfettered
discretion
simply
to
hold
onto
it.
the
law
says,
for
instance,
that
the
agency
can't
use
this
power
to
earn
profit
on
the
land.
but
the
point
is
that
the
statute
makes
it
plain
that
the
agency
is
empowered
to
lease
the
land
or
to
sell
it
to
the
tenant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
possibly.
obviously,
if
the
act
works
as
intended
i
wouldn't
expect
that
to
happen.
but
it's
important
to
see
that
the
act
structurally
has
three
features
that
are
very
different
from
what
the
appellees
would
suggest
and
that
make
the
hawaii
housing
authority
anything
but
a
vapid
conduit.
first
of
all,
it
is
suggested
by
the
appellees
that
the
housing
authority
may
take
only
those
lots
for
which
the
individual
occupant
has
filed
an
application.
that
isn't
true.
it
may
take
any
or
all
of
the
lots
in
the
tract.
second,
they
suggest
that
it
must
sell
the
lot
to
the
occupant,
and,
although
it
probably
would
end
up
doing
that,
that's
not
a
requirement
of
the
act.
and
third,
they
suggest
that
the
hawaii
housing
authority
must
pay
owners
with
funds
supplied
by
the
buyers
rather
than
with
public
funds.
again,
the
act
makes
clear
that
purchasing
these
lots
with
public
funds
is
another
option.
now,
any
reasonable
legislature
that
chose
to
do
that
would
presumably
find
a
mechanism.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
were
it
to
do
that,
i
think
it
might
violate
the
prescription
against
running
the
system
for
profit.
that
is,
the
statute
says
that
it's
not
supposed
to
be
used
to
generate
surplus
revenue
for
the
state.
and
if
the
agency
does,
as
the
act
i
think
implicitly
contemplates,
end
up
transferring
title
to
the
current
occupant,
presumably
any
rational
system
would
tax
the
occupant
with
the
benefit
of
then
becoming
the
owner.
and
so
the
fact
that
ordinarily
the
purchase
price
would
come
from
the
occupant
is
what
one
would
expect.
in
fact,
let
me
say
that
i
don't
stress
the
mechanical
details
to
suggest
that
the
act
would
not
ordinarily
work
much
as
they
suppose,
but
if
it
does
it
simply
means
that
the
legislature
was
correct
in
its
assessment
that
once
the
tight
grip
of
the
oligopoly
in
this
case
was
broken,
then
one
would
see
the
transactions
flow
naturally.
that
is,
then
one
would
see
those
who
lived
on
the
land,
who
wanted
to
buy
the
land
under
their
feet,
could
afford
to
do
so,
would
simply
do
so.
so
that
the
hawaii
housing
authority
facilitates
that
process.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
the
occupant
could
sell
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
the
occupant
could
sell
it.
but
the
point
is,
there
would
now
be
a
market
within
which
these
sales
would
take
place.
that
is,
as
with
any
kind
of
divestiture
of
an
oligopoly,
whether
it's
bell
telephone
or
anybody
else,
one
is
not
interested
here
in
state
socialism
or
the
government
continuing
to
run
this
land.
this
is
not
an
urban
redevelopment
case
or
an
urban
redevelopment
tract.
the
point
is
the
public
purpose
here,
the
public
use,
is
to
break
up
oligopoly,
a
fairly
traditional
public
purpose,
and
then
let
the
market
do
what
it
will.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
not
entirely,
justice
brennan.
in
fact,
the
statute
has
been
put
in
what
the
appellees
have
called
a
holding
pattern
in
all
but
one
case,
and
when
i
get
to
pullman
and
younger
standing
i
want
to
focus
quite
closely
on
that
case.
it's
the
case
of
kamiloiki
valley,
and
in
that
case
as
this
court
sits
an
appeal
is
being
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
in
a
proceeding
that
we
will
argue
ought
to
have
led
the
courts
below
not
to
leap
to
judgment,
much
less
leap
to
invalidation
of
this
statute,
but
to
abstain
under
either
pullman
or
younger
or
both.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
without
giving
the
hha
an
option
first
to
purchase.
i
think
that's
right,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
there
are
certain
limitations.
but
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
on
the
whole
the
point
of
the
act
is
to
create
a
market
and
not
to
have
continuing
supervision,
and
for
that
reason
we
don't
emphasize
such
marginal
limitations
as
there
are.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
hha
has
not
otherwise
put
the
market...
put
the
property
up
for
sale
and
the
purchase
price
is
tendered,
i
believe
within
60
days,
title
must
then
pass
to
the
qualified
purchaser.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
the
only
theory,
justice
white--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose
if
the
argument
were
that
their
holding
of
the
undeveloped
land
off
the
market
is
itself
a
sign
of
oligopoly
and
that
they
must
be
forced
to
put
some
of
that
on
the
market
as
well
in
return
for
just
compensation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
we
would
be
making
exactly
the
same
argument,
though
i
suppose
that
the
record
in
the
case
would
look
different
and
the
findings
that
the
legislature
made
would
be
quite
different
in
character.
there
are
other
limits
i
suppose
i
might
mention,
justice
brennan,
and
that
is
that
the
hha
may
not
sell
to
any
purchaser
more
than
one
lot.
and
if
by
some
combination
a
purchaser
were
able
to
acquire,
let's
say,
two
lots
and
another
purchaser
three
and
the
two
purchasers
together
might
be
deemed
owners
of
a
single
development
tract
of
five
lots,
then
they
again
would
be
subject
to
the
act.
and
if
for
some
reason,
though,
as
i
tried
to
describe,
the
market
would
almost
surely
prevent
it,
the
competitive
forces
working
on
consumer
desires
to
own
the
land,
if
for
some
reason
such
purchasers
began
then
refusing
to
sell
and
leasing
the
land
for
55
years
or
longer,
as
the
appellees
in
this
case
do,
then
the
act,
which
restructures
the
market,
would
again
be
operative.
that
is,
this
act
does
not
become
functus
officio
the
moment
the
new
owner
occupies.
this
act
is
a
permanent
restructuring
of
the
land
market
of
hawaii,
designed
to
create
a
market
where
now
there
is
market
control.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
that
is
hardly
a
radical
step.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
white--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
certainly
is
a
shortage
of
land
for
single
family
dwellings.
but
were
the
economic
incentives
to
be
changed,
it
might
well
happen
that
the
major
landowners
would
take
some
of
the
land
that
they
have
now
allowed
to
lie
fallow--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
is
some
more,
but
the
shortage
is
substantial.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
of
these
leaseholds?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
the
statistic
that
i
think
may
be
most
responsive
to
that
question,
justice
white,
is
that
of
the
single
family
houses
on
oahu,
the
percentage
that
are
on
leased
land
has
been
rising
up
until
at
least
1978.
it
went
from
16
percent
in
1961
to
34
percent
in
1974.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
because
the
problem
is
different.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
the
problem,
however,
is
focused,
the
economic
problem
is
focused
on
oahu,
and
the
availability--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
legislature--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
the
overwhelming
population
center
and
the
overwhelming
center
of
the
urban
residential
problem.
but
the
legislature
found
that
a
statewide
solution
would
make
more
sense.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
but
the
relevant
figure,
justice
white,
would
not,
i
suppose,
be
the
percentage
of
homes
that
are
leased,
but
the
percentage
of
land
which
is
controlled
by
a
group
of
people
who
thereby
have
market
force.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
i
was
trying
also
to
suggest,
justice
white,
that
the
economic
incentives
to
hold
that
land
off
the
market
would
be
changed
once
competition
was
restored
within
the
residential
area.
that
is,
right
now--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
is
suggested
by
the
legislature
that
the
practices,
the
market
practices
of
deciding
how
much
land
to
allow
for
residential
development
are
affected
by
the
concentration
of
market
power.
here
one
must
remember
that
the
top
three
private
owners
own
40
percent
of
the
privately
held
land
on
oahu.
the
top
12
own
80
percent.
and
by
any
test
for
oligopoly,
or
indeed
monopoly,
when
a
small
handful
of
owners
own
an
enormous
percentage
of
the
relevant
resource,
one
has
a
problem.
in
any
event,
it's
the
legislature's
task
to
decide
when
that
problem
exists.
in
doing
so,
the
legislature
in
this
case,
following
lessons
i
think
as
old
as
quia
emptores
and
the
statute
of
uses,
did
what
the
early
colonies
in
part
did
in
trying
to
throw
off
the
fetters
of
land
monopolies
traceable
to
a
monarchy
and
used
a
rather
conventional
antitrust
approach,
one
not
so
different
from
what
this
court
approved
in
block
v.
hirsch,
where
the
court
held
that
where
land
is
monopolized
in
comparatively
few
hands
government
may
redress
a
housing
shortage
by
transferring
control
over
the
reversionary
interest,
and
there
there
wasn't
even
compensation,
as
there
is
here.
now,
it's
true
that
when
a
permanent
measure
is
installed
which
transfers
the
whole
subsurface
property
right
to
the
surface
owner,
compensation
may
be
required,
as
it
was
in
pennsylvania
coal.
but
that
is
provided
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would
think--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
unless
this
court
is
to
overrule
new
motor
vehicle
board
v.
fox,
that
that
really
cannot
be
a
factor
at
all.
in
this
case
the
court
made
clear
that
a
great
many
regulatory
schemes
where
the
government
seeks
not
to
be
an
officious
intermeddler
but
to
create
a
market
rely
on
a
private
triggering
mechanism.
so
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
to
make
that
a
factor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that
in
the
grendel's
den
case
it
was
the
vesting
of
absolute
veto
power
in
a
church
in
particular,
power
not
simply
to
initiate
the
governmental
process
but
power
to
mandate
a
veto,
as
in
eubank
and
richmond,
as
in
that
line
of
cases,
that
was
the
decisive
thing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
quite
often
the
judicial
system
relies
on
the
exclusive
action
of
a
private
individual
to
bring
a
suit,
but
that's
the
way
government
often
works.
for
the
government
to
insist
that
it
will
create
a
market
no
matter
what,
even
if
no
one
wants
to
buy
or
is
able
to
buy,
would
not
make
any
sense
at
all,
i
think.
and
in
general,
i
suppose
their
whole
philosophy,
the
philosophy
of
the
appellees
in
this
case,
is
that
the
involvement
of
private
entities,
whether
to
trigger
the
act
or
as
the
possible
owners
of
the
property
once
the
act
has
done
its
job,
creates
a
terribly
suspect
situation.
now,
if
the
public
use
requirement
means
anything
of
that
sort,
then
it
seems
to
me
block
v.
hirsch
must
be
overruled,
berman
v.
parker
must
be
overruled,
the
mill
act
decisions
of
1885
must
be
overruled,
and
the
court
will
end
up
reading
the
public
use
requirement
as
a
requirement
that
all
public
purposes
must
be
executed
through
purely
public
governmental
enterprises,
that
private
enterprise
can
play
no
role
in
a
legitimate
governmental
scheme.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
not
the
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
it
doesn't.
it
didn't
in
the
cases
like
highland
boy
and
others
where
the
private
individual
ended
up
paying
for
what
was
involved.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
guess,
justice
o'connor,
the
reason
i
don't
think
so,
although
it
has
some
intuitive
appeal,
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
that
if
the
public
decides
that
it
wants
to
spend
public
money,
let's
say
benefiting
a
crony
of
the
mayor,
so
it
will
take
a
factory,
turn
it
over
to
the
mayor,
i
would
think
it
makes
matters
worse,
not
better,
that
the
mayor's
friend
doesn't
even
have
to
pay.
in
a
case
like
this,
it's
perfectly
natural
that
those
who
occupy
should
be
the
ones
who
are
taxed
by
the
public.
in
any
case,
let
me
briefly
turn
to
the
abstention
issues,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
does
have
doubts
along
the
lines
that
you're
suggesting...
is
there
genuinely
a
public
purpose...
and
if
the
court
for
the
first
time
in
decades
were
willing
to
repudiate
legislative
findings--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
abstention,
unless
we
go
with
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
thibodaux,
that
abstention
was
required,
but
the
court
could
quite
efficiently
say
that
in
dictum
and
uphold
this
law
on
the
merits,
rather
than
dragging
out
what
i
think
is
frankly
a
wholly
unsubstantiated
attack
against
the
validity
of
the
law.
we
are
not
trying
to
have
it
both
ways.
from
the
very
beginning,
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
urged
that
there
should
be
abstention.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
you
think
those
uncertainties
could
invalidate
it,
then
of
course
you
must
wait.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
then
i
think
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
either
to
require
abstention
or
to
decide
that,
since
so
much
water
has
gone
under
this--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would
like
to
do
just
that,
i
would
like
to
do
just
that.
let
me
say
as
to
pullman
abstention,
if
there
are
any
doubts
about
the
public
purpose,
it
is
the
courts
of
hawaii
in
the
now
pending
case
that
should
answer
the
question.
but
that
pending
case
shows
you
precisely
how
younger
abstention
also
was
mandated.
that
is,
in
that
case
a
trial
on
just
compensation
was
held
in
november
of
'82,
a
trial
on
public
use
was
held
in
1983.
but
for
all
practical
purposes,
once
the
hawaii
housing
authority
decided
that
it
would
serve
a
public
purpose
to
take
the
kamiloiki
tract
on
march
30,
1979,
that
case
was
pending
and
under
younger
there
should
have
been
abstention.
and
in
fact
we
have
argued,
i
think
without
any
meaningful
rebuttal
from
the
appellees,
that
as
early
as
february
22nd,
1979,
six
days
before
this
federal
complaint
was
filed,
they
had
every
opportunity
to
present
to
the
hawaii
housing
authority
all
of
their
constitutional
objections,
and
they
did
so
in
a
letter,
in
a
letter
which
urged
it
on
constitutional
grounds
to
go
for
them.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
that
happens,
for
this
court
to
reach
the
merits
is
wholly
unnecessary,
although
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy,
feeling
that
the
state
has
unjustly
been
dragged
through
years
of
litigation,
if
it
is
clear
to
the
court,
as
i
think
it
could
well
be,
that
this
law
is
obviously
valid
on
its
face,
the
court
might
well
say
so.
let
me
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
speaking
for
the
state
of
hawaii
and
not
i
think
for
any
thugs,
this
law
i
think
is
plainly
valid.
and
i
think
i
now
finally
understand
the
circle
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
appellees'
argument.
the
circle
is
this:
it's
okay
to
take
this
property,
but
you
need
a
public
purpose.
so
justice
white
asks:
why
isn't
spreading
ownership
a
public
purpose.
and
then
we're
told:
oh,
that's
a
public
purpose,
but
you
need
to
act
constitutionally.
and
then
we
ask:
why
isn't
this
constitutional?
oh,
because
there's
no
public
purpose.
i
suppose
they
try
to
escape
from
that
circle
by
one
narrow
escape
route,
and
that
is
to
argue
that
the
government
must
somehow
always
take
for
itself.
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
white
ask
about
the
irrigation
cases
and
the
road
cases,
and
we're
told
they're
distinguishable,
as
is
the
chief
justice's
question
about
urban
redevelopment,
because
there,
you
see,
the
government
has
a
plan.
we
have
a
plan,
too;
they
just
don't
like
our
plan.
our
plan
is
to
break
up
their
market
power.
as
justice
o'connor
perceives
and
as
justice
stevens'
question
i
think
indicates,
this
is
just
like
other
forms
of
divestiture.
but
their
answer
is
divestiture
is
regulation,
it's
not
taking.
i
think
this
court
really
is
concerned
with
realities
and
not
just
labels.
the
reason
that
taking
is
used
rather
than
regulation
is
that
they
had
the
lobbying
power
to
avoid
the
regulatory
route.
and
when
they
point
out,
more
or
less
equating
themselves
with
the
government,
that
the
government
too
has
a
lot
of
land,
why
doesn't
it
sell
it,
i
think
i
understand
what
people
in
hawaii
mean
when
they
say
that
these
landowners
are
hawaii's
other
government.
when
they
also
say
that
this
statute
is
unprecedented,
that
no
legislature
has
ever
been
so
bold,
i
am
reminded
of
the
virginia
legislature
in
1779
which
broke
up
landholdings
in
a
way
parallel
to
this,
of
the
connecticut
legislature
in
1793,
and
of
pennsylvania
in
1799.
this
is
not
unprecedented
action.
and
even
if
you
take
the
pigeonholing
approach
of
insisting
that
it
be
compared
explicitly
with
other
contemporary
exercises
of
the
taking
power,
it
doesn't
look
all
that
unprecedented
to
me.
it's
not
really
different
from
pennsylvania
coal
v.
mahon,
where
property
rights
were,
this
court
held,
in
effect
taken
from
the
owner
of
the
mining
rights
under
the
land
and
transferred
to
the
surface
owner.
what
followed
from
that?
that
there
was
no
power
to
do
it
because
it
went
from
a
to
b?
no,
all
that
followed
was
that
you
had
to
compensate,
and
there
is
no
challenge--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
suppose
the
condemned,
though,
might
have
been
happy
to
have
the
law
wholly
invalidated.
the
brief
i
think
urged
also
invalidation,
and
the
court
made
clear,
i
think,
that
if
there
were
compensation
that's
all
that
would
be
required.
in
fact,
the
key
line
in
justice
holmes'
opinion
is
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
must
not
take
a
constitutional
shortcut,
it
must
pay.
now,
when
the
state
of
hawaii
decided
to
use
eminent
domain,
to
avoid
the
constitutional
shortcut
of
the
maryland
type
law
that
required
the
inclusion
of
options
to
purchase,
it's
remarkable
that
then
the
appellees
turn
around
and
say,
because
we're
using
eminent
domain,
with
its
guarantees
of
compensation,
that
now
you
should
strike
the
law
down.
and
it's
remarkable
that
they
say
that
because
those
people
who
occupy
the
land
will,
of
all
things,
end
up
paying
for
it,
that
that
makes
this
law
unconstitutional.
we
don't
think
this
court
should
so
hold.
thank
you.
