unknown
speaker
how
about
a
next
income
tax,
mr.
griffith?
unknown
speaker
is
there
all
that
much
difference
between
a
gross
income
tax
and
a
net
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
a
gross
income
tax
is
necessarily
one
on
the
passenger?
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so,
or
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
the
statute
is
defined
four
different
ways,
to
hit
a
tax
directly
on
the
passenger
or
a
tax
on
the
carriage
of
that
passenger,
or
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
air
transportation,
or
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
realized
by
the
airline.
yes,
but
what
i
am
try...
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
a
gross
income
tax
or
gross
receipts
tax
on
the
airline
that
is
collected
at
the
head
office
of
the
airline,
it
isn't
imposed
on
passengers
individually
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--is
that
appreciably
different
from
a
net
income
tax
similarly
reflected?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
act
does
not
prohibit,
i
gather,
a
property
tax
or
a
franchise
tax
to
be
levied
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
and
what
reason
would
congress
have
to
forbid
the
use
of
gross
receipts
as
a
measure
for
imposing
a
property
tax
or
a
franchise
tax?
unknown
speaker
if
the
amount
is
the
same?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
is
what
you
have
argued
on
the
purpose,
but
if
the
state
can
get
the
same
revenue
and
just
label
it
something
else,
it
is
little
hard
to
understand
the
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
congress
has
amended
the
law
in
a
way
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
tax
years
in
question
here.
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
since
amended
it,
and
they
have
created
a
new
exemption
for
in
lieu
taxes.
now,
if
that
were
applicable
today,
does
that
have
any
implication
on
this?
unknown
speaker
mr.
griffith,
if
you
should
prevail
here,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
the
state
from
turning
around
and
levying
even
a
higher
income
tax
on
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
but
you
might
win
a
pyhrric
victory
then
here.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
the
only
kind
of
tax
they
could
levy
either,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
entirely
an
intrastate
airline,
didn't
fly
over
international
waters,
you
would
have
no
case
here,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
griffith--
unknown
speaker
--the
airlines
over
a
number
of
years
accepted
this
tax,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
your
client
didn't.
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--you
represent
aloha?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
file
protests
every
year
or
something?
did
you--
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
you
will
speak
about
the
language
of
the
statute,
won't
you,
because
i
have
gone
through
your
brief
and
i
do
not
find
it
quoted
anywhere.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
you
didn't
mention
in
responding
to
justice
blackmun,
or
at
least
i
didn't
hear
you--
unknown
speaker
--that
the
prohibition
is
not
just
on
taxing
the
sale
of
air
transportation
but
goes
as
they
are
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
a
gross
receipts
tax?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
tax
on
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
on
what,
gross
receipts?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
on
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
then
how
is
that
measured?
how
is
it
measured?
unknown
speaker
receipts.
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
this
is
a
gross
income
tax.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
different
from
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
you
require
them
to
report
their
gross,
"their
gross
receipts"?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
say
that
is
not
a
gross
receipts
tax.
unknown
speaker
i
have
problems.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dexter,
they
don't
say
anything
about
the
value
of
the
franchise
in
the
statute
itself,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
and
it
says
there
shall
be
leveled
and
assessed
upon
each
airline
a
tax
of
4
percent
of
its
gross
income
each
year
from
the
airline
business.
unknown
speaker
it
is
really
something
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
definition
of
public
utility?
unknown
speaker
is
that
statute
quoted
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
is
that
statute
quoted?
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
them
pay
the
federal
8
percent
transportation
tax,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just,
nevertheless,
none
of
them
have
to
charge
their
customers
the
8
percent.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
that
argument
would
carry
considerable
weight
if
the
claim
here
were
that
the
tax
on
your...
the
levy
by
hawaii
violated
equal
protection,
but
it
is
that
it
violates
a
specific
prohibition
in
an
act
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
but
it
just
certainly,
its
language
just
doesn't
bear
that
construction,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
no,
gross
receipts
tax
on
air
transportation
is
a
tax
of
general
applicability,
don't
you
think?
i
don't
see
why
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
air
transportation
or
receipts
is
any
less
a
tax
of
general
applicability
than
a
net
income
tax
on
the
revenue
from
air
transportation.
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong
that
the
purpose
of
this
tax
was
to
build
the
airports?
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
didn't
build
them,
you'd
have
to
build
them,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
your
real
problem
here
is
that
gross
receipts
doesn't
mean
gross
receipts.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
will
take
on
the
problem
if
what
a
gross
receipt
is
or
happens
to
be.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
supporting
that
you
had
a...
say
you
win
this
case,
and
there
is
another
state
that
doesn't
have
the
same
history
of
taxing
in
the
way
you
say
hawaii
always
has,
but
just
decides,
well,
since
hawaii
can
impose
this
tax,
i
think
it's
a
pretty
good
idea,
let's
impose
a
gross
income
tax
in
the
language
of
the
hawaii
statute.
would
that
statute
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
even
if
their
new
statute
i
described
is
in
exactly
the
same
language
as
the
hawaii
statute?
unknown
speaker
concerned
about
airlines,
certain
carriers:
there
shall
be
levied
and
assessed
upon
each
airline
a
tax
of
4
percent
of
its
gross
income.
say
i
am
in
ohio
or
iowa
or
someplace
like
that,
would
i
have
to
look
at
the
history
of
iowa
and
ohio
taxes
to
decide
whether
that
was
constitutional,
i
mean,
consistent
with
the
federal
statute,
not
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
tell
that
other
than
by
the
fact
the
statute
applies
only
to
airlines?
this
statute
only
applies
to
airlines.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
imposed
a
property
tax
measured
by
$10
per
passenger
flying
on
the
aircraft?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
this
an
indirect
gross
receipts
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
trouble
is
the
statute
says
the
tax
will
be
on
gross
income,
and
that
sounds
like
the
subject
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
in
the
taxing
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
have
some
of
the
airlines
paid
the
tax
and
without
any
objection
for
some
time?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
what
has
been...
what's
the
airlines'
practice
under
this
tax?
do
they
add
it
to
the
fare?
unknown
speaker
put
they
don't
say
on
their...
they
don't
have
a
separate
item
they
add
to
the
bill
for
taxes
for
each
passenger.
unknown
speaker
does
any
of
them,
does
any
of
them
do
that?
unknown
speaker
does
any
of
them
do
that,
just
automatically
add
the
gross
income
tax
to
the
fare?
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
airlines
than
these
two
involved
in
this
controversy
directly
or
indirectly?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
