mr.
richard
l.
griffith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
consolidated
cases
are
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii.
they
present
a
single
issue,
whether
a
hawaii
tax
of
3
percent
of
the
gross
income
of
airlines
from
the
airline
business
is
exempt
from
the
section
of
the
federal
aviation
act,
49
u.s.c.,
section
1513,
which
forbids
a
state
from
levying
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
from
the
carriage
of
passengers
or
the
sale
of
air
transportation.
the
hawaii
supreme
court
upheld
the
hawaii
tax.
its
decision
thus
conflicts
with
the
holdings
of
the
other
state
courts
which
have
considered
the
same
issue,
namely,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals
of
arizona,
and
the
superior
court
of
alaska,
all
of
which
have
struck
down
similar
state
taxes
because
of
this
federal
statute.
also,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
the
attorney
general
rendered
an
opinion
that
the
ohio
tax
was
invalid
in
view
of
the
federal
statute,
and
the
ohio
legislature
then
repealed
the
tax.
appellants
aloha
airlines
and
hawaiian
airlines
are
commercial
airlines
flying
in
federal
airways
between
the
six
major
islands
of
hawaii.
i
will
make
three
points
on
oral
argument,
and
only
three.
first,
the
plain
language
of
the
federal
statute,
49
u.s.c.
1513,
prohibits
this
tax.
second,
the
hawaii
tax
can't
be
saved
under
subsection
(b)
of
that
federal
statute
because
subsection
(b)
is
consistent
with
subsection
(a).
and
finally,
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
requires
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
airlines
in
this
case
because
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said
in
section
1513,
and
it
meant
to
forbid
precisely
this
kind
of
state
tax.
with
regard
to
my
first
point,
that
the
federal
statute
expressly
prohibits
the
hawaii
tax,
we
need
examine
only
the
gist
of
the
hawaii
tax
statute
and
the
key
sentence
of
the
federal
statute.
first,
the
hawaii
statute
says
there
shall
be
levied
and
assessed
upon
each
airline
a
tax
of
4
percent
of
its
gross
income
each
year
from
the
airline
business.
that
language
conflicts
directly
with
the
federal
statute
which
provides
no
state...
this
is
the
federal
statute...
no
state
shall
levy
or
collect
a
tax,
fee,
head
charge
or
other
charge
directly
or
indirectly
on
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce
or
on
the
carriage
of
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce,
or
on
the
sale
of
air
transportation,
or
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
this
federal
statute
thus
expressly
prohibits
every
conceivable
method
by
which
a
state
could
tax
the
carriage
of
passengers
by
air
or
the
sale
of
air
transportation
or
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
subsection
(b)
expressly
permits
a
net
income
tax,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
i
think
there
definitely
is.
a
gross
income
tax
is
a
tax
at
the
immediate
point
of
transaction
between
a
passenger
and
the
airline,
or
between
a
customer
and
the
provider
of
a
service,
and
that
is
a
tax
which
can
easily
be
passed
on
dollar
for
dollar
to
the
customer.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
very
definitely
different
in
concept
and
theory,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
because
a
net
income
tax
depends
on
many
other
factors
besides
the
price
of
a
ticket.
it
depends
on
administrative
overhead,
it
depends
on
many
other
things,
including
other
deductible
state
taxes.
many
other
deductions
and
concepts
are
woven
in
before
you
get
to
the
net
of
a
company.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
because
congress--
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
--congress
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
price
of
air
fares,
and
the
fact
is
that
congress
as
part
of
an
overall
federal
program
levied
an
8
percent
federal
excise
tax
on
air
fares.
it
did
not
want
the
states
competing
with
that
tax.
it
did
not
want
the
states
adding
an
additional
tax
up
on
top
of
the
federal
tax
because
that
federal
tax
was
the
prime
revenue
raiser
to
fund
the
congress'
airport
aid
program,
a
program
which
funneled
vast
sums
out
to
the
states
for
the
development
of
airports.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
states
cannot
reach
the
same
revenue
through
another
label.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
congress
left
the
two
key
sections
we
are
talking
about,
(a)
and
(b)
of
section
1513,
undisturbed.
it
then
added
an
in
lieu
tax,
but
that
would
be
taxes
not
prohibited
by
subsection
(a),
but
certain
in
lieu
taxes
in
other
areas
providing
that
the
funds
received
from
such
in
lieu
tax
go
into
airport
development
and
improvement.
the
hawaii
tax
does
not
do
that.
the
hawaii
tax
goes
into
the
general
state
treasury.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
nothing
whatsoever
except
the
usual
constitutional
guarantees
against
unequal
treatment,
but
otherwise
nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
we
are
willing
to
take
that
chance,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
subsection
(b)
lists
a
whole
litany
of
state
taxes
that
are
still
permitted
so
long
as
they
do
not
reach
head
taxes,
gross
receipts
taxes,
taxes
on
air
carriage,
taxes
on
the
sale
of
transportation.
so
long
as
the
states
will
stay
away
from
the
area
of
prohibition,
they
have
freedom
to
tax
the
airlines
like
any
other
business
or
citizen.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
we
would
have
a
case,
your
honor.
i'll
tell
you
why.
and
the
arizona
case
was
exactly
on
this
point.
section
1513
speaks
of
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce,
and
it
also
speaks
in
terms
of
carriage
of
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce.
air
commerce
is
a
defined
term
in
the
federal
aviation
act.
it
has
several
definitions,
but
one
key
definition
is
flights
within
the
federal
air
space.
the
flights
of
the
two
airlines
before
you
today
are
entirely
within
the
federal
air
space,
so
even
if
we
were
totally
intrastate,
we
would
be
covered
by
this
statute,
and
in
fact,
i
would
remind
you,
in
the
arizona
case,
cochise
airlines
was
flying
between
points
in
the
state
of
arizona;
it
was
stipulated
that
that
was
intrastate,
but
because
of
that
definition
of
air
commerce,
that
airline's
flights
clearly
came
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
in
subsection
(a)
congress
precluded
all
traditional
forms
of
tax
by
specifically
prohibiting
any
tax
or
any
fee
or
any
head
charge,
and
it
then
went
on
to
try
and
preclude
preventive
minds
by
prohibiting
other
charges
to
ensure
that
this
prohibition
would
encompass
any
prohibited
tax,
however
labeled.
second,
congress
broadly
defined
the
subjects
and
measures
of
tax
to
be
prohibited:
namely,
taxes,
first,
on
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce;
second,
on
the
carriage
of
persons
traveling
in
air
commerce;
third,
on
the
sale
of
air
transportation;
and
fourth,
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
and
then
finally,
congress
extended
this
absolute
prohibition
to
all
taxes
that
are
directly
or
indirectly
levied
or
collected
on
any
of
these
prohibited
areas.
congress
thus
meant
to
sweep
the
field
clean
of
state
taxes
on
air
carriage,
on
gross
receipts
therefrom,
and
on
head
taxes.
the
plain
language,
i
submit,
of
section
1513(a)
thus
prohibits
the
hawaii
tax.
now,
the
director
of
taxation
of
hawaii
attempts
to
avoid
the
effect
of
this
language
with
several
theories,
mostly
looking
to
subsection
(b)
of
the
federal
statute,
and
our
second
major
point
is
that
these
arguments
should
not
prevail
because
subsection
(b)
is
clearly
consistent
with
subsection
(a)
which
i
have
quoted
with
you.
after
sweeping
the
field
clean
of
gross
receipts
and
head
taxes,
congress
added
subsection
(b)
simply
to
clarify
which
state
taxes
are
still
permitted.
this
section
provides
that
states
may
levy
taxes
other
than
those
enumerated
in
(a),
and
then
it
lists
property
taxes,
net
income
taxes,
franchise
taxes,
and
sales
or
use
taxes.
but
the
key
clause
in
the
subsection
(b)
is
taxes
other
than
those
enumerated
in
subsection
(a).
this
clause
clearly
means
that
a
state
will
be
permitted
to
levy
a
tax
if
but
only
if
that
tax
is
not
based
on
the
carriage
of
passengers
or
the
sale
of
air
transportation
or
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
the
director
argues
that
the
hawaii
tax
is
a
property
tax
and
thus
is
permitted
under
subsection
(b)
because
that
is
one
of
the
listed
taxes
there,
and
he
relies
on
a
phrase
in
the
hawaii
statute
which
says
"this
tax
is
a
means
of
taxing
the
personal
property
of
airlines
and
other
carriers.
"
there
are
several
flaws
in
this
argument.
first,
the
hawaii
tax
is
actually
based
solely
on
gross
receipts.
it
therefore
violates
subsection
(a)
and
is
not
permitted
under
(b)
because
the
hawaii
tax
is
not
one
of
those
taxes
other
than
those
enumerated
in
subsection
(a).
the
director,
it
seems
to
us,
is
therefore
asking
this
court
to
rewrite
subsection
(b)
and
to
ignore
that
clause,
taxes
other
than
those
enumerated
in
subsection
(a).
but
this
clause
cannot
be
ignored.
secondly,
the
hawaii
tax
is
in
no
sense
truly
a
property
tax.
the
tax
return
used
requires
information
only
as
to
the
airline's
gross
receipts.
it
requires
no
information
as
to
the
airline's
personal
property.
the
tax
is
only
labeled
as
a
means
of
taxing
the
personal
property,
and
justice
marumoto
in
his
dissent
below
pointed
out
that
hawaii
has
no
personal
property
tax
as
such,
and
there
was
none
at
the
time
this
tax
was
enacted.
federal
standards
are
controlling
here,
and
for
federal
purposes,
i
submit
this
is
not
a
personal
property
tax.
the
director
also
argues
that
section
1513(a)
prohibits
only
taxes
on
gross
receipts
and
not
property
taxes
measured
by
gross
receipts.
but
i
submit
this
argument
exalts
form
over
substance
and
asks
this
court
to
disregard
the
broad
sweep
of
subsection
(a)
which
forbids
the
use
of
gross
receipts
as
the
measure
of
a
tax
as
well
as
the
subject
of
a
tax.
finally,
the
director
argues
that
the
hawaii
tax--
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
--yes.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
our
client
did
not,
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
aloha
airlines.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
we
have
protested
and
contested
the
tax
back
to
the
first
effective
year.
the
director
argues
the
tax
is
a
general
business
tax
which
does
not
discriminate
against
airlines
because
other
businesses
in
hawaii
bear
a
similar
state
tax
on
their
gross
receipts.
the
flaw
in
this
argument
is
that
unlike
other
businesses
in
hawaii
in
general,
the
airline
passenger
fares
are
already
burdened
with
an
8
percent
federal
excise
tax.
in
its
wisdom,
congress
determined
that
this
federal
tax
is
steep
enough
and
that
the
states
cannot
tax
air
fares
or
tax
the
gross
receipts
of
airlines
from
air
transportation.
congress
believed
that
any
state
taxes
on
top
of
the
already
steep
federal
tax
would
discourage
air
traffic
and
would
reduce
the
yield
of
the
federal
tax,
thereby
depriving
the
airport
and
airway
development
program
of
the
funds
to
carry
out
its
purpose.
finally,
my
last
argument,
and
i
will
be
brief,
although
resort
to
legislative
history
is
not
required
because
i
believe
we
have
a
very
clear
federal
statute
here,
i
believe
this
legislative
history
clearly
tells
us
that
congress
meant
to
say
exactly
what
it
said
in
section
1513,
and
meant
to
bar
precisely
the
kind
of
tax
here
in
issue.
in
1970
congress
found
that
the
nation's
airports
and
air
control
system
were
outmoded
and
inadequate
to
handle
the
massive
growth
in
air
traffic.
congress
responded
with
a
two-part
program.
first,
it
vastly
increased
grants
of
federal
funds
to
the
states
for
airport
improvement.
and
second,
to
pay
for
this
program,
it
adopted
a
comprehensive
and
uniform
program
of
federal
taxes
on
passengers
and
on
airlines.
that
comprehensive
program
has
been
considered
and
described
by
this
court
in
massachusetts
v.
the
united
states
in
1978
in
a
very
able
opinion
written
by
justice
brennan.
the
most
significant
tax
in
this
federal
program,
and
the
largest
revenue
raiser
by
far
is
the
8
percent
federal
tax
on
all
domestic
air
fares.
after
this
program
took
effect,
congress
learned
of
efforts
by
states
and
localities
to
impose
head
taxes
and
gross
receipts
taxes
of
their
own.
congress
regarded
the
state
and
local
taxes
as
a
threat
to
the
revenue
base
underlying
the
1970
airport
development
program,
and
in
1973
it
enacted
the
airport
development
acceleration
act
which
included
this
federal
statute
that
i
have
been
describing
today,
and
it
also
included
an
additional
increase
in
grants
to
the
states
for
airport
development.
in
fact,
in
the
years
in
issue,
this
fine
program
has
yielded
$55
million
to
the
state
of
hawaii
for
airport
and
airway
grants.
that
is
the
six
years
after
1973.
also,
we
note
that
congress
recently
acted
to
continue
this
program
of
grants
and
taxes
until
the
year
1987.
so
this
decision
is
important.
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
airlines
in
this
case.
he
has
called
the
hawaii
tax
a
threat
to
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
federal
airport
development
program.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
he
points
out
that
if
this
court
is
to
sanction
the
hawaii
tax,
other
states
would
regard
the
decision
as
an
invitation
to
evade
the
federal
prohibition
by
labeling
their
gross
receipts
taxes
as
a
means
of
taxing
personal
property.
surely,
congress
did
not
intend
that
its
mandate
be
so
easily
evaded
or
that
its
national
fiscal
program
be
so
easily
undermined.
congress
in
its
wisdom
has
determined
that
the
steep
federal
tax
on
passenger
air
fares
is
all
the
taxation
that
air
carriage
of
persons
should
bear.
at
the
same
time,
the
federal
government
has
distributed
substantial
grants
to
the
state,
fueling
a
great
improvement
in
the
nation's
airports.
the
plain
words
of
the
federal
statute
forbid
this
hawaii
tax.
the
court
should
not
embark
on
an
invitation
to
rewrite
that
plain
language,
and
the
hawaii
tax
should
be
stricken
and
the
decision
below
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
l.
griffith
thank
you.
just
a
couple
of
quick
points.
my
learned
friend
has
described
at
length
the
ohio
tax
as
a
discriminatory
one,
but
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
tax
commissioner
of
ohio
appeared
before
the
house
commerce
committee
and
went
to
great
lengths
to
list
the
various
ohio
taxes
and
to
show
that
in
fact
the
ohio
tax
was
not
discriminatory
as
compared
to
the
railroads,
the
truckers,
or
other
businesses,
and
he
then
submitted
language
to
the
congress
to
permit
a
nondiscriminatory
gross
excise
tax.
the
congress
declined
his
invitation.
they
did
not
accept
his
language,
and
i
think
that
tells
us
that
congress
was
concerned
about
much
more
than
discriminatory
taxes.
finally,
i
would
just
point
out
that
the
hawaii
statute
says
that
it
is
levied
and
assessed
upon
each
airline
a
tax
of
4
percent
of
its
gross
income
each
year
from
the
airline
business,
and
then
it
goes
on
later
on
to
say
that
that
tax
is
in
lieu
of
the
hawaii
general
excise
tax
which
is
also
a
gross
income,
gross
receipts
tax.
i
have
no
further
points.
