mr.
william
david
dexter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
that
aloha
airlines
and
hawaiian
airlines
in
the
argument
here
have
said
nothing
that
has
not
been
substantially
covered
in
the
briefs.
so
i
would
like
to
focus
this
court's
attention
on
what
i
believe
to
be
some
of
the
underlying
practical
considerations
that
need
to
be
considered
and
undoubtedly
are
controlling
in
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
william
david
dexter
yes.
well,
let
me
just
answer
that
question
right
now.
the
statute
has
to
do
with
the
same
user
taxes
that
were
preempted
by
congress
under
the
airport
and
airways
development
act.
congress
had
imposed
an
8
percent
ticket
tax
on
domestic
flights,
a
3
percent
enplaning
tax
on
international
flights,
and
a
5
percent
tax
on
air
transportation
of
goods.
now,
1513(a)
simply
prohibits
a
tax
on
the
air
transportation
of
persons.
also,
it
prohibits
a
tax
on
the
air
carriage
of
persons
in
interstate
commerce.
it
also
prohibits
a
tax
on
the
sale
of
air
transportation.
those
are
the
three
taxes
that
are
prohibited.
those
parallel,
if
you
will,
the
federal
taxes
that
have
been
preempted
by
congress,
and
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief,
those
deal
with
specific
subjects
of
taxation.
subsection
(b)
says
except
for
the
taxes
enumerated
in
subsection
(a)--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--what?
mr.
william
david
dexter
but
on
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
history
is
concerned,
is
traceable
to
a
discriminatory
ohio
tax
on
singling
out
airlines.
one
of
the
basic
positions
that
we
have
that
there's
much...
that
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
congress
taxing
me
and
not
taxing
anyone
else
and
congress
saying
that
i
am
singled
out
for
an
exemption.
what
subsection
(a)
is
designed
to
do
is
to
prevent
directly
or
indirectly
imposition
of
those
kinds
of
head
taxes
preempted
by
congress,
and
the
pro...
the
quid
pro
quo
there
was
increased
congressional
involvement
in
airport
development
and
financing.
the
legislative
history
clearly
indicates
that
this
was
the
balancing,
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
general
business
taxes.
mr.
william
david
dexter
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
this
tax
is
a
tax,
a
utilities
tax--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
it's
a
general
utilities
tax
imposed--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--it's
on
the
franchises,
the
business,
the
going
concern's
values
of
the
property
the
same
as
the
old
utility
taxes
on
railroads
or
other
utilities.
mr.
william
david
dexter
no.
the
property...
the
property...
the
going
concern
value
of
the
property
is
the
thing
that
this
statute
focuses
on,
and
in
order
to
determine
the
going
concern
value
of
utility
property,
this
court
for
100
years
has
realized
that
you
look
at
the
income
that
is
being
produced
by
that
property
that
has
to
be
used
solely
for
utility
purposes.
ad
valorem
valuations
of
it
or
looking
at
it
in
different
ways
doesn't
work.
so
all
that
the
hawaii
legislature
has
done
is
imposed
a
franchise
privilege
tax
on
the
utilization
of
tangible
property
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
including
going
concern
value.
mr.
william
david
dexter
it
is
measured
by
the
gross
income--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--of
the
utility.
mr.
william
david
dexter
but
it
is
measured
by
the
gross--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
it's...
we
don't
quibble
with--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--yes,
they
are
required--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--it
is
not
a
tax
on
gross
receipts.
mr.
william
david
dexter
okay,
but
if
you
look...
if
you
look
at
what
they
are
trying
to
measure,
your
honor,
they
are
trying
to
measure
the
value
of
the
franchises.
they
are
trying
to
measure
the
value
of
the
doing
business
privileges
in
the
state.
they
are
trying
to
measure
the
value
attributable
to
how
they
are
able
to
use
the
property,
and--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
the...
it
says
doing
business,
but
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
public--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--but
as...
but
it
is
a
franchise...
if
you
look
at--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--if
you
look
at
a
utility,
a
definition
of
a
public
utility--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--it
is
in
section
269-1
of
the
hawaiian
statutes,
you
can
see
how
they
are
talking
about
trying
to
get
at
measuring
the
going
concern
value
of
utility
property
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
and
it
is
not
what
we
consider
a
traditional
tax
on
gross
receipts.
it
is
measured.
mr.
william
david
dexter
what?
mr.
william
david
dexter
no,
it
is
not,
and
we
would...
there
are
some
supplemental
statutes
we
want
to
refer
to
here
in
the
argument,
if
i
get
to
it...
and
we
would
be
glad
to
furnish
a
supplemental
appendix
to
the
court.
let's
turn
back
to
these
practical
considerations
that
i
wanted
to
talk
about.
the
hawaiian
tax
here
applies
to
all
of
the
income
from
the
business
activities
of
these
airlines.
that
is
the
public
service
company
tax.
the
airlines
are
here
contending
that
only
the
tax
as
applied
to
their
receipts
from
air
transportation
of
persons
is
invalid,
so
they
have
asked
for
a
specific
deduction
from
the
tax.
they
are
not
claiming
the
tax
is
invalid.
in
addition,
the
airlines'
pay
on
their
nonoperating
utility
property
a
general
business
privilege
tax
measured
by
4
percent
of
gross
receipts.
so
they
have
paid
into
the
state
of
hawaii
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
substantial
business
activities
in
hawaii
as
a
public
utility
and
otherwise
of
3
or
4
percent
of
a
tax...
a
tax
on
3
or
4
percent
of
their
total
gross
income
from
that
business.
now,
the
hawaii
tax,
indicating
again
the
nature
of
its
franchise,
the
hawaii
tax
is
due
january
1,
measured
by
the
receipts
of
the
prior
year
for
the
next
ensuing
calendar
year,
very
much
like
a
franchise
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
business
for
the
next
year,
very
much
like
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
where
the
tax
is
due
on
a
specific
date.
in
contrast,
the
1513(a)
tax
is
on
a
transactional
type
of
tax
for
the
furnishing
specifically
of
air
transportation
services.
so
the
tax
computation
under
1513(a)
and
the
actual
tax
computation
under
the
hawaiian
public
service
tax
are
entirely
different.
now,
the
hawaiian
tax
applies
only
to
intrastate
business
in
hawaii,
considering
the
interisland
transportation
as
intrastate.
for
instance,
united
air
lines,
northwest
orient,
other
airlines
that
fly
in
and
out
of
hawaii
that
do
not
do
intrastate
business
pay
no
public
service
commission
tax.
it
is
only
on
those
utilities
conducting
a
substantial
intrastate
business
with
employees,
substantial
properties,
substantial
business
activities
there.
now,
the
hawaii
tax
also
applies
to
all
other
utilities
doing
business
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
the
public
service
commission
tax
applies
to
all
utilities.
therefore,
steamship
companies,
gas
companies,
electric
companies,
motor
carrier
companies,
telephone
companies
and
so
forth
all
pay
the
same
tax
at
the
same
or
higher
rate
than
the
tax
impose
on
the
airlines
in
question.
in
addition,
comparable
taxes
are
paid
by
every
business
in
the
state
of
hawaii
measured
by
gross
receipts
with
the
exception
of
life
insurance
companies
and
financial
institutions.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
your
honors,
neither
do
the
airlines
here.
those
taxes
are
imposed
on
me
or
you
when
we
go
to
buy
a
ticket.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
david
dexter
this
is
true.
there
is
that
difference.
but
all
of
them,
whether
it
is
an
attorneys,
doctors,
barbers,
whatever,
taxi
cab
drivers,
every
business
in
hawaii
is
required
to
pay
this
4
percent
general
excise
tax.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
we
think...
well,
let...
we
think
that
(a)
is
talking
about
specific
excise
taxes
where
airlines
have
been
singled
out
for
discriminatory
treatment
such
as
the
ohio
excise
tax.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
if
you
look
at
(b),
i
mean,
just
step
back
from
the
language,
what
was
congress
trying
to
get
at
in
(a)?
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
then
look
at
(b).
(b)
is
talking
about,
except
for
the
taxes
enumerated
in
(a),
(a)
are
specific
excise
taxes
on
air
transportation,
directly
or
indirectly.
that
is
what
all
the
legislative
history
is
about.
what
does
(b)
say?
(b)
talks
about
taxes
of
general
applicable.
for
instance,
compare--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
you
had...
for
instance,
take
the
problem
of
the
net
income
tax
you
raised.
this
court
said,
i
think,
in
the
oakcoke
blue
company
case
that
any
deduction
from
gross
receipts
that
was
not
proportionate
to
the
receipts
resulted
in
an
income
tax,
so
that
when
you
are
talking
about
the
differences
between
the
taxes
in
terms
of
labeled
used
in
(b),
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
subsidiary
to
what
was
the
general
pattern
of
(a)
versus
(b),
and
(a)
was
singling
out
airlines
for
discriminatory
treatment
by
indirect
means...
by
directly
or
indirectly
imposing
head
taxes
or
comparable
taxes.
(b)
assured
everyone
that
it
did
not
include
any
general
applicable
business
taxes.
in
my
judgment,
that
is...
if
you
want
to
get
a
large
framework
to
look
at
the
statutory
language.
mr.
william
david
dexter
yes,
this
is
true.
mr.
william
david
dexter
the
local
governmental
units
would
have
had
to
try
to...
or
states
would
have
to
try
to
do
it.
mr.
william
david
dexter
but
you
see,
what
we
have
here--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
my
real...
no,
my--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--that
is
not
my
problem
because
i
can
distinguish
very
much
between
a
public
utility
tax,
you
know,
a
general
utility
tax--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
even
if
this
were
a
gross
receipts
tax,
the
question
is,
is
it
the
type
of
gross
receipts
tax
congress
was
directing
its
attention
to
in
1513(a)?
was
it
talking
about
specific
types
of
excises
for
airport
development,
or
was
it
trying
to
immunize
the
airlines
from
the
general
business
taxes
of
selected
states
that
historically
happen
to
have
measured
their
general
business
taxes
by
gross
receipts?
or
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
issue,
the
way
that
it
is
framed
by
the
airlines,
is
by
congress
imposing
a
head...
user
taxes
on
you
and
me
for
the
purpose
of
airport
development
and
improvement,
it
intended
to
exempt
airlines
from
their
obligation
to
pay
their
fair
share
of
general
business
taxes
on
the
happenstance
that
those
taxes
historically
were
measured
in
some
states
by
gross
receipts.
that
in
my
judgment
is
the
basic
issue
here,
and
we
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
congressional
record
or
history
to
support
that
idea.
mr.
william
david
dexter
your
honor,
we
have
said
in
our
brief
two
things.
one,
we
think
that
the
congress
intended
by
the
legislative
history
to
prevent
head
taxes
or
that
type
of
taxes,
directly
or
indirectly;
and
secondly,
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
airlines
being
singled
out
for
discriminatory
treatment.
so
i
would
say
if
somebody
wanted
to
impose
a
gross
receipts
tax
on
airlines
and
single
them
out
for
discriminatory
treatment,
i
think
that
this
would
very
well
be
prohibited
by
this
statute.
but
i
do
not
think
congress--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--if
it
were...
no,
but
if
it
were,
if
it
were,
included
everything--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
see
whether
airlines
have
been
singled
out
for
discriminatory
treatment.
that
was
the
problem
with
the
ohio--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--no,
but
that
is
part,
that
is
part
of
the
public
service
company
tax.
it
applies
to
all
utilities.
that
was
singled
out
there
because
of
airlines
traveling
in
interisland
transportation
under
the
old
decisions
of
this
court,
whether
you
could
use
a
direct
measure
of
gross
receipts.
so
they
used
a
property
tax...
imposed
a
property
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts
for
utility
purposes.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
i
think
that
that
would...
that
would
obviously
be,
in
my
judgment,
an
indirect
head
tax.
mr.
william
david
dexter
that's
been
in
effect
since
1933,
or
companion
bills
to
that.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
current
legislation.
i
think,
you
know,
it's
not,
it's
simply
not
in
our
judgment
that
kind
of
tax.
it
certainly
has
not
been
a...
no
general
business
taxes
were
discussed
in
the
legislative
history.
two
prime
sponsors
of
the
legislation
were
senator
magnuson
from
the
state
of
washington
and
representative
brock
adams,
and
washington
has
a
business
and
occupation
tax
measured
by
gross
receipts.
it
includes
the
intrastate
receipts
of
airlines,
and
no...
and
they
were...
senator
magnuson
and
adams,
representative
adams
were
prime
sponsors
of
this
kind
of
legislation,
made
no
mention
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
about
the
washington
tax
or
any
other
general
business
taxes.
in
fact,
the
reason
that
we
have
published
and
printed
this
187
page
volume
is
simply
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
there
is
not
one
word
in
that
volume
having
to
do
with
general
business
taxes
except
one
statement,
and
that
was
the
statement
of
the
representative
of
the
airline
industry,
mr.
tipton,
and
in
reference
to
the
ohio
discriminatory
tax
he
said
we
oppose
this
tax
because
it
singles
out
and
discriminates
against
the
airlines.
but
he
very
definitely
said
that
the
airlines
had
no
objection
in
ohio
or
elsewhere
of
paying
their
fair
share
of
general
business
taxes
along
with
other
members
of
the
business
community.
and
what
i
think
is
the
real
differentiation
here
is
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
being
singled
out,
congress
singling
out
an
industry
from
general
business
taxes
for
preferential
purposes
on
the
happenstance
that
they
might...
on
the
happenstance
that
those
taxes
are
measured
by
gross
receipts.
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
that
and
singling
out
the
airlines
for
discriminatory
tax
treatment
by
duplicating
federal
head
taxes
directly
or
indirectly.
and
i
think
that
is
really
the
underlying
question
here.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
although
i
know
that
i
have
had
some
problems
with
it
with
this
court
at
the
moment,
but
there
is,
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
public
service
company
tax,
a
utility
tax,
and
a
tax
directly
on
gross
receipts.
now,
i
know
there's
much
argument
in
the
briefs
of
the
airlines
that
there
is
no
difference
between
a
measure
and
a
subject
matter
of
the
tax,
but
i
believe
if
you
do
some
real
reflecting,
you
will
have
to
realize
you
have
got
to
have
a
subject
of
a
tax
because
you
can't
measure
nothing.
there
is
in
every
taxing
statute
that
i
have
ever
seen
two
things,
a
subject
and
a
measure.
now,
if
the
measure,
the
court
might
say
the
measure
is
the
same
as
the
subject
and
substitute,
then,
the
measure
for
the
subject,
but
you
always
have
to
have
in
place
these
two
things.
and
we
think
this--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--well,
but
then
it
turns
around,
your
honor,
and
says
it
is
a
means
of
taxing
the
personal
property
of
the
airlines,
including
the
tangible
and
intangible
and
going
concern
values.
it
is--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--yes,
it
does,
yes,
that's
the
last
part
of...
that's
the
last
part
of
239-6.
so
it
was
a
means
of
taxing,
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
public
utility
in
269-1
of
the
hawaiian
statute,
you
see
that
in
the
definition
of
the
public
utilities
they
were
trying
to
arrive
at
the
growing
concern
value
of
these
franchises
and
properties
used
by
the
utilities,
and
the
easiest
and
most
direct
way
to
do
it
was
to
measure
that
by
capitalizing
net
income,
which
we
do
many
times
in
the
utility
field
today,
or
taking
the
gross
receipts.
and
those
really
are
the
same
as
property
taxes
because
as
was
indicated,
the
1982
amendment
to
1513,
by
adding
subsection
(d)
clearly
indicates
that
in
lieu
of
property
taxes
were
covered
by
(d),
and
(d)
had
to
do
with
the
property
taxes
permitted
under
(b),
so
that
in
lieu
of
taxes
are
within
the
scope
of
property
taxes
under
1513.
and
i
would
suggest
if
other
were
not,
then
the
four
r
legislation
under
the
railroad
revitalization
act
of
1975
and
the
same
language
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980
would
not
become
effective
because
on
those
utilities
they
talk
about
ad
valorem
property
taxes,
but
obviously
those
statutes
have
been
construed
by
the
lower
courts
to
include
in
lieu
of
taxes
measured
by
gross
receipts.
so
we
think
that
traditionally
in
this
country,
for
over
a
century,
property
taxes
on
utilities
have
been
measured
by
gross
receipts,
and
there's
many
decisions
of
this
court
that
uphold
it.
so
if
the
question
became
whether
this
is
indeed
a
property
tax
under
(b),
we
submit
that
it
really
is.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
as...
the
airlines
in
question
here,
your
honor,
and
all
the
airlines,
paid
the
tax
for
a
number
of
years
without
question.
we
believe
that
there
is
nothing,
there
is
nothing
in
this
legislative
history
that
ever
indicated
that
congress
was
talking
about
invalidating
any
state's
general
business
taxes.
mr.
william
david
dexter
no.
they...
it's
absorbed.
there's
no,
in
fact,
it's
not
separately
stated
in
hawaii
at
all.
it's
just
part
of
their
general
cost
of
doing
business.
mr.
william
david
dexter
no,
no,
no.
this
is
just...
well,
we
think
it
is
a
general
problem--
mr.
william
david
dexter
--what?
mr.
william
david
dexter
not
that
i
know
of.
most
gross
income
taxes
are
considered
general
business
taxes
and
are
absorbed.
now,
there's
some
taxes
are
passed
on
under
the
hawaii
general
privilege,
business
and
privilege
4
percent
tax
in
order
to
get
the
federal
tax
deduction
for
income
tax
purposes.
mr.
william
david
dexter
well,
it
involves...
it
involves,
as
far
as
hawaii,
no,
there's...
i
guess...
well,
there
may
be
some
smaller
airlines
there,
but
this
is
the...
these
are...
the
tax
here
is
confined
to
the
intrastate
flights
in
hawaii,
and
i
think
most
of
the
states
that
apply
their
gross
receipts
don't
tax...
that
have
gross
receipts
privilege
taxes
don't
include
any
interstate
flight
receipts.
we
are
talking
about
a
local
business
basically.
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
i
think
is
an
important
example
of
legislative
history,
and
it
is
set
forth
in
pages
22
and
25
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
washington
and
other
states.
in
those
pages,
this
was...
senator
cotton
of
new
hampshire
wanted
to
grandfather
in
the
new
hampshire
head
tax,
so
he
proposed
to
senator
cannon,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation,
an
amendment
to
grandfather
in
the
head
tax
of
new
hampshire
until
the
end
of
1973.
in
that...
and
senator
cannon
agreed
to
it.
and
in
agreeing
to
it,
he
said
that
this
covers
only
the
head
tax
now
in
effect
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
now,
the
language
submitted
by
senator
cannon
i
believe
is
set
forth
on
page
79
of
the
legislative
history
appendix
is
identical
to
the
language
of
sectin
1513(a).
in
other
words,
that
shows
specifically
a
legislative
intent
that
they
were
talking
about
the
subject
matter
generally
of
head
taxes,
the
direct
or
direct
imposition
of
them.
in
fact,
the
language
"or
the
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom.
"
is
admitted
by
the
air
transport
association,
the
solicitor
general,
the
airlines
in
question,
to
have...
to
find
its
place
in
the
statutory
language
only
to
take
care
of
the
specific
excise
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
ohio.
ohio
had
imposed
on
airlines
alone
an
excise
tax
on
air
transportation
measured
by
the
empaneling
or
depaneling
of
passengers,
and
the
airline
association
and
others
were
disturbed
about
that
kind
of
specific
discriminatory
tax
against
airlines,
and
everybody
agrees,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
legislative
history
known
about
this,
that
the
phrase
"or
gross
receipts
derived
therefrom"
had
to
do
with
that
legislation.
and
i
would
like
to
close
by
saying
you
can
go
through
this
187
pages
of
legislative
history,
you
will
hear
the
words
discriminatory
taxes,
head
taxes,
or
equivalent
taxes
and
abuses.
you
will
never
hear
one
word
about
any
nondiscriminatory
general
business
taxes
of
any
state
in
these
united
states
mentioned.
and
i
want
to
also
tell
you
that
if
you
decide
that
congress...
that
the
airlines'
position
is
right
in
this
case,
you
will
have
decided
that
congress
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
nation
had
singled
out
one
industry
from
discharging
their
general
obligations
to
state
governments.
thank
you.
