mr.
thomas
reed
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
an
action
brought
by
an
illinois
public
school
teacher
against
its
employer,
the
board
of
education,
pursuant
to
u.s.
code
section
1983.
more
specifically,
in
final
analysis
this
is
a
breach
of
contract
case
in
which
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
two
to
one
decision
agreed
that
the
public
school
teacher
had
a
property
right
protected
by
the
united
states
constitution
to
continued
employment,
which
was
deprived
of
him
when
the
board
of
education
did
not
renew
his
probationary
contract
and
did
not
provide
to
him
reasons
for
nonrenewal,
nor
a
hearing
prior
to
that
termination.
now,
this
case
arises
within
a
statutory
framework
called
the
illinois
tenure
scheme,
and
i
think
because
of
its
bearing
on
the
case
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
to
elaborate
in
regard
to
that
particular
statutory
scheme.
illinois,
like
many
states,
has
a
statutory
tenure
scheme
which
applies
to
public
school
teachers.
specifically,
in
illinois
the
tenure
act
is
found
in
sections
24-11
and
24-12
of
the
illinois
school
code.
for
the
court's
identification,
these
statutory
provisions
are
set
forth
at
pages
56
through
61
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
in
essence,
the
statutory
scheme
provides
as
follows:
a
public
school
teacher
who
is
employed
for
two
consecutive
years
in
full-time
service,
that
being
the
probationary
period,
acquires
what
we
call
tenure,
contractual
continued
service
in
the
state
of
illinois.
once
the
teacher
acquires
tenure,
a
teacher
cannot
be
dismissed
for
other
than
cause
and
only
after
a
rather
elaborate
procedural
process
has
taken
place.
to
the
contrary,
the
nonrenewal
of
a
probationary
teacher,
whether
it
be
a
first
year
probationary
teacher
or
a
second
year
probationary
teacher,
is
a
rather
simple
procedure.
the
first
year
probationary
teacher
is
entitled
to
nothing
more
than
notice
of
nonrenewal
to
be
given
to
that
person
at
least
60
days
before
the
end
of
the
current
school
term.
for
a
second
year
probationary
teacher,
a
notice
of
nonrenewal
must
contain
the
reason
or
reasons
for
the
nonrenewal.
there
are
no
express
provisions
found
in
section
24-11
dealing
with
the
termination
of
a
probationary
teacher
in
the
current
contract
term.
it
should
be
noted
that
another
provision
of
the
illinois
school
code,
that
being
section
10-22.4,
empowers
a
board
of
education
in
illinois
to
dismiss
teachers,
whether
they
be
probationary
or
tenured
teachers,
for
the
following
reasons:
incompetency,
cruelty,
negligence,
immorality,
or
other
sufficient
cause,
and,
important
to
this
case,
whenever
in
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
education
the
interests
of
the
school
require
the
dismissal.
it
is,
as
i
have
suggested,
within
this
statutory
framework
that
the
facts
of
this
case
came
to
pass.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
in
my
judgment,
yes,
it
could.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
whenever
the
interests
of
the
school
requires
the
dismissal
means
to
me
that
the
board
can
dismiss
for
any
reason
or
no
reason.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
it
would,
except
for
the
statutory
provision
found
in
section
24.12
which
specifically
says
that
a
tenured
teacher
must
be
dismissed
for
specific
cause.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that
provision,
of
course,
i
think
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
the
nonrenewal
aspect
of
a
probationary
teacher's
contract.
in
other
words,
that
person
will
serve
out
that
first
year
and
his
contract
will
not
be
renewed
for
a
second
year.
under
the
statutory
scheme,
unless
that
nonrenewal
notice
is
given
the
teacher
is
automatically
re-employed
for
the
second
year.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
think
that
can
be
gleaned
from
the
fact
that
the
dissenting
justice
did
not
discuss
that
in
his
dissent.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that's
correct.
the
district
court,
after
a
bench
trial,
made
the
following
findings
which
are
pertinent
to
this
case:
first
of
all,
that
the
respondent
teacher
had
executed
a
one-year
employment
contract
with
the
board
of
education.
secondly,
that
a
consensus
of
the
board
of
education,
a
consensus
of
the
board,
had
promised,
and
made
the
promise
through
an
oral
representation
of
the
superintendent
to
the
teacher,
that
his
contract
would
be
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
first
contract
year.
and
that
representation
was
made
at
the
time
of
initial
employment.
it
was
not
made
at
the
end
of
the
first
contract
year.
rather,
it
was
made
at
the
time
of
initial
employment.
the
respondent
relied
in
part
upon
this
representation,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
left
his
job
in
joliet,
illinois,
and
moved
to
paris,
illinois,
to
assume
his
coaching
and
administrative
responsibilities.
another
finding
was
that
the
petitioners
in
fact
did
notify
the
respondent
on
march
the
3rd,
1981,
that
his
contract
would
not
be
renewed,
and
that
renewal
without
more
did
meet
the
strict
requirements
of
the
probationary
nonrenewal
notice
provisions
of
the
school
code.
the
respondent
was
given
no
reasons
for
his
nonrenewal
and,
furthermore
and
finally,
the
respondent
was
not
given
a
pre-termination
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
not
given
a
hearing
by
the
board
of
education
at
all
in
this
matter.
he
did
in
fact
bring
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
a
little
more
than
a
month
after
the
notice
of
nonrenewal
was
given.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
yes.
in
addition
to
the
findings
made
by
the
district
court,
the
district
court
also
made
certain
conclusions
of
law,
which
i
think
are
important
also.
the
district
court
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
the
representation
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
employment
that
the
board
of
education
had
bound
itself
to
a
two-year
term
contract
with
the
respondent
teacher,
and
that
this
contract
was
enforceable
under
illinois
law,
that
being
a
one-year
term
written
contract
followed
by
a
one-year
implied
promise
or
oral
contract
for
the
second
year.
that
was
as
a
matter
of
finding
enforceable
under
illinois
law.
the
second
finding
or
conclusion
of
law
was
that
that
two-year
employment
contract
was
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
do,
and
i
will
address
that.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
this
is
true,
except
i
think
that
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
take
a
look
at
illinois
law
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
not
one
illinois
court
has
ever
interpreted
this
particular
provision,
that
being
section
24-11.
it
has
never
been
required
to
interpret
that.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
think
that
the
state
law
issue
certainly
does
come
into
play
when
we
get
into--
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
--no,
i
don't
believe
i
do.
but
i
think
that
the
state
law
issue
comes
into
play
quite
significantly
when
we
talk
about
the
property
right,
because
as
we
know
from
this
court's
prior
decisions,
property
rights,
particularly
property
rights
in
employment,
are
created
by
state
law
and
not
the
constitution.
and
i
realize
that
i
have
a
tough
row
to
hoe
when
it
comes
to
this
court
looking
at
state
law.
but
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
we
have
raised,
and
we
think
that
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
been
given
the
opportunity,
had
this
case
been
filed
in
the
state
court
system,
that
it
would
have
held
that
section
24-11
does
not
allow
for
more
than
two
successive
one-year
term
contracts.
and
we
say
that
primarily
on
the
strength
that
under
illinois
law
public
entities
have
only
those
powers
that
are
granted
to
them
by
the
state
legislature.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
that
notice
be
given
to
the
first
year
probationary
teacher
that
his
employment
would
be
renewed.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
well,
the
history
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
interpreting
the
tenure
provisions
has
been
that
the
court
has
strictly
construed
those
provisions
dealing
with
nontenured
teachers
and
in
fact
has
given
a
tremendous
amount
of
flexibility
to
boards
of
education
in
dealing
with
the
nontenured
teachers.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
as
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
there
are
four
points
on
which
i
think
this
court
can
reverse
this
case.
the
first
we
have
discussed.
i
will
move
on
again
into
the
other
points.
the
second
is
that
under
the
illinois
statutory
scheme
a
probationary
contract
is
not
a
property
interest
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
section
1983,
and
i
say
that
because
there
is
no
for-cause
standard
for
discharge
found
in
section
10-22.4,
that
being
the
statutory
provision
that
sets
forth
when
a
board
can
or
what
a
board
can
dismiss
a
teacher
for.
it
is
our
reading
of
this
court's
cases,
both
and
bishop,
that
a
for-cause
standard
is
necessary
within
the
statutory
framework
to
create
the
kind
of
property
interest
which
is
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
separate
the
issue
of
whether
you
can
have
a
two-year
contract--
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
--well,
the
important
point
here
i
think
is
that
this
court's
decisions
place
a
great
deal
of
importance
on
state
law
interpretation,
and
in
this
case
we
have
not
had
the
benefit
of
that
analysis
because
we
have
not
had
a
state
court,
whether
it
be
an
appellate
court
or
the
supreme
court,
address
either
the
issue
of
the
legality
of
a
two-year
term
probationary
contract
nor
whether,
if
that
is
authorized,
that
term
contract
constitutes
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
and
if
i
read
this
court's
decisions
correctly,
it's
that
state
court
determination
that
this
court
must
rely
on
in
regard
to
the
judgmental
call
as
to
whether
a
property
interest
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
third
point
which
i
wish
to
address
is
that,
even
if
there
is
a
property
interest
under
state
law,
there
has
been
no
deprivation
of
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution.
i
say
that
because
the
respondent's
remedy
in
this
case
is
for
money
damages.
under
illinois
law
the
respondent
has
no
right
to
specific
performance.
he
has
a
right
to
recover
lost
pay
if
he
is
successful
in
his
litigation.
we
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
final
deprivation
of
a
right
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
until
or
unless
the
state
would
foreclose
his
opportunity
to
bring
suit
in
the
state
courts
to
seek
redress,
that
being
for
money
damages,
there
has
been
no
deprivation.
another
point
which
i
wish
to
make--
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
--that
would
be
akin
to
the
provisions
in
section
24-12
which
allow
for
reinstatement
of
a
tenured
teacher
who
would
be
discharged
and
found
that
the
discharge
was
not
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
in
my
judgment
it
would
be.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that's
our
analysis
of
the
deprivation
issue,
is
that
his
deprivation
takes
place
if
the
state
were
to
foreclose
him
from
bringing
an
action
for
the
collection
of
that
salary
that
is
due
him
in
a
breach
of
contract
case.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
must
grant
that
the
deprivation
concept
dovetails
into
the
due
process
analysis
also,
because
one
of
the
tests
that
this
court
has
set
forth
when
you
must
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
due
process
or
due
process
without
law
is
if
the
deprivation
is
final.
and
that
brings
me
to
my
final
point
which
i
care
to
make.
i
think
that
on
the
strength
of
the
perry
case
and
the
logan
case
decided
by
this
court
that
the
respondent
vail
clearly
has
an
adequate
state
law
remedy.
he
has
a
common
law
remedy
in
the
state
courts
for
breach
of
contract.
and
as
i
read
the
logan
case,
if
that
common
law
remedy
will
make
the
respondent
whole,
which
it
would
in
this
case
because
under
illinois
law
he
is
only
entitled
to
money
damages,
then
the
state
law
remedy
is
adequate
and
there
has
been
no
due
process
violation.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
do,
because
of
the
fact
that
under
our
law,
as
i've
stated,
he
has
no
right
to
specific
performance.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
notice
was
given
on
march
3rd.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
yes.
the
effective
date
of
his
contract...
the
termination
date
was,
as
i
recall,
june
the
15th.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
yes.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
the
notice
that
terminated
his
services
said
that
the
effective
date
was
june
the
15th.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
yes,
he
did.
he
completed
that
year
of
employment.
he
was
not
terminated
on
the
spot.
so
yes,
he
could
have
brought
the
suit,
but
no,
the
illinois
state
court
would
not
have
enjoined
the
board
of
education.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
that's
correct,
because
under
illinois
law
he
has
an
adequate
remedy
for
damages,
and
that
is
the
appropriate
remedy
for
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
yes,
sir.
i
will
reserve
the
time
i
have
remaining.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
my
fourth
point,
justice
white,
was
a
combination
of
the
deprivation
and
due
process
analysis
and,
as
i've
suggested
to
the
court,
because
of
the
state
law
remedy
there
has
been
no
denial
of
due
process
without
law.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
briefly,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
remedy
issue
and,
contrary
to
what
counsel
i
believe
was
attempting
to
imply,
there
is
no
federal
common
law
remedy
to
reinstatement
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
this
court's
decision
in
bishop,
footnote
number
14,
would
indicate
that
reinstatement
for
the
failure
to
provide
pre-termination
hearings
are
very
rare
indeed
and
only
occur
in
those
situations
in
which
the
statute
itself
is
a
for-cause
provision.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
no,
i
do
not
believe
that...
i
believe
that
the
federal
court
has
that
power
to
certainly
issue
that
injunction.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
under
illinois
law
and
i
think
the
stated
law
of
this
court
that
if
there
is
shown
a
breach
of
contract
that
there
is
no
remedy
to
reinstatement
for
an
employee
of
this
classification--
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
--no,
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
i
do
not
deny
that.
what
i
am
stating
to
the
court
is
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
illinois
law
was
that
no
reason
need
be
given
to
the
respondent
for
his
discharge,
because
of
the
fact
that
section
10-22.4
says
that
whenever
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
a
discharge
is
warranted
you
may
discharge
that
person.
mr.
thomas
reed
miller
this
case
i
believe
from
my
point
of
view
cries
out
for
state
court
determination,
because
of
the
facts
that...
or
the
points
that
there
has
been
no
state
law
determination
of
the
probationary
term
contract,
there
has
been
no
state
law
determination
as
to
whether
a
term
contract
in
a
probationary
framework
is
a
property
right.
and
the
seventh
circuit
holds
in
this
case
that
a
term
contract
is
a
property
right,
and
where
do
we
draw
the
line?
do
all
elements
of
term
contracts
then
have
property
vestage?
let's
take,
for
an
example,
an
element
of
the
respondent's
contract,
a
fringe
benefit
that's
a
part
of
that
total
package.
if
that
stick,
if
you
will,
is
taken
away
from
the
respondent
without
a
pre-termination
hearing,
is
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
it
appears
to
me
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
all
term
contracts,
and
specifically
in
the
backdrop
of
a
state
statutory
tenure
scheme,
are
property
rights,
that
we
certainly
do
open
up
the
floodgates
for
the
federal
courts
to
determine
not
only
whether
this
is
or
is
not
a
property
right,
but
also
what
process
is
due.
what
form
does
that
pre-termination
hearing
take?
will
that
not
be
litigated
extensively.
if
the
respondent
was
not
satisfied
in
this
case
with
the
form
of
the
pre-termination
hearing
that
he
got,
that
would
be
an
issue
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
decide
likewise.
so
for
these
reasons,
the
petitioner
board
of
education
feels
strongly
that
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
