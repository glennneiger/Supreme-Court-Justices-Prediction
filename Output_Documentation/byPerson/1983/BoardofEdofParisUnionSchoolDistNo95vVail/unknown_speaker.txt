unknown
speaker
could
the
board
dismiss
in
the
middle
of
the
first
year
for
no
cause?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
you
would
apply
to
a
tenured
teacher.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
about
the
provision
that
says
you
may
dismiss
a
probationary
teacher
if
you
give
him
60
days
notice
before
the
end
of
his
first
year?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
that
notice
is
just
notice
and
not
any
sort
of
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
none
of
the
three
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
your
analysis
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
he
assumed
there
was
some
kind
of
a
contractual
right?
unknown
speaker
you
have
said
you
were
commenting
on
the
district
court's
findings.
i
take
it
now
you're
going
to
kind
of
a
narrative
account
of
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree
with
that
first
finding
or
conclusion
of
law
by
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
fairly
tough
row
to
hoe
in
this
court,
i
suppose
you
realize,
because,
you
know,
the
district
judge
is
obviously
formerly
an
illinois
lawyer
and
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
issue
with
that
finding.
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
think
that's
why
we
would
grant
certiorari
in
a
case
like
this,
in
order
to
look
at
illinois
law
and
see
if
it
were
properly
applied
by
a
district
court
and
affirmed
by
a
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
don't
need
to
win
on
that
to
win
this
case,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
miller,
what
if
the
board
had
given
vail
the
initial
one-year
contract,
but
at
the
same
time
had
given
him
the
statutory
notice
that
he'd
be
re-employed
for
another
year
at
the
end
of
the
first
year?
wouldn't
that
have
given
him
a
valid
two-year
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
point
is
just
that
it
doesn't
seem
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
statute
as
they're
set
out.
so
i
think
the
argument
that
they
can't
have
a
two-year
contract
is
essentially
a
weak
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
you've
used
up
more
than
a
third
of
your
time
and
you
haven't
really
gotten
to
the
heart
of
your
case
yet.
unknown
speaker
this
is
only
slightly
different
from
your
first
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
because
you're
really
saying
that
if
he
had
sued
in
state
court
he
would
be
met
with
your
point
that
there
was
no
breach
of
contract
because
we
can
fire
for
no
cause
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
contrary
to
the
state
law
finding
by
the
district
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you're
talking
about
it
in
two
different
paragraphs,
but
it
sounds
like
almost
the
same
argument.
but
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
would
you
feel
differently
about
that
if
the
contract
were
specifically
enforceable
under
illinois
law?
would
you
think
then
it
would
constitute
property?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
protectable
property
interest?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
about
your
deprivation
argument.
if
you
assume
he
had
a
contract
right
and
pursuant
to
that
contract
he
was
getting
a
check
every
week
or
every
month
or
whatever
it
was,
and
then
the
board
took
action
and
he
stopped
getting
that
check
and
nobody
else
did
anything
after
that,
you
say
he's
not
been
deprived
of
anything.
he's
just
not
getting
the
money
any
more.
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
more
like
an
argument
that
he's
got
adequate
process
available.
it
seems
to
me
when
he
stops
getting
his
money
there's
been
a
deprivation.
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
say
that's
not
a
deprivation.
nobody
does
anything
after
that.
it's
a
rather
dramatic
change
in
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
if
they
notified
him
that
he
was
terminated,
he
was
being
terminated,
and
said,
if
you
have
any
objection
to
this
we'd
be
glad
to
give
you
a
hearing
in
the
local
courts,
we
will
be
glad
to
litigate
with
you
in
the
local
courts,
you
think
that
is
a
satisfactory
enough
provision
for
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
when
was
his
notice
given?
unknown
speaker
how
far
before
the
end
of
the
school
year?
60
days?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
then
knew
he
was
terminated.
unknown
speaker
he
could
have,
i
suppose,
brought
suit
in
the
state
court
right
then,
and
i
suppose,
although
you
perhaps
don't
get
specific
performance,
could
the
local
courts...
suppose
they
didn't
get
around
to
trying
the
case
until
after
june.
could
they
have
enjoined
his
discharge
pending
outcome
of
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
he
had
60
days
to
bring
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
couldn't
have
enjoined
the
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
remedy
of
a
probationary
teacher,
you
say?
unknown
speaker
you
never
got
around
to
your
fourth
point,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ansel,
what
elements
of
your
client's
case
other
than
the
final
constitutional
framing
of
it
come
from
any
place
other
than
illinois
law?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
really
a
diversity
case
without
diversity.
unknown
speaker
but
all
of
the
analysis
that
goes
into
deciding
whether
he
has
what
you
refer
to
as
a
protectable
property
interest
depends
entirely
on
illinois
contract
law,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ansel,
do
you
agree
that
the
only
remedy
provided
under
illinois
law
for
a
breach
is
a
damages
action--
unknown
speaker
--for
a
non-tenured
teacher?
unknown
speaker
and
you
also
agree
that
illinois
law
did
not
provide
for
a
hearing
before
the
notice
of
termination
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that
affects
the
reasonableness
of
the
reliance
by
a
probationary
teacher
on
those
processes?
in
other
words,
why
would
a
probationary
teacher
have
a
right
to
expect
more
than
the
illinois
law
provided
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
possible
at
least
that
the
notion
of
a
property
interest
protectable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
should
turn
at
least
in
part
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
owner's
reliance
on
whatever
entitlement
he
has?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
under
state
law
he's
not
entitled
to
a
hearing,
why
is
it
reasonable
to
expect
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
arguing
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that's
so,
but
certainly
not
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ansel,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
illinois
gave
no
adequate
remedy
to
your
client.
would
your
client
have
had
a
damages
remedy
under
illinois
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
since
that's
all
that
the
district
court
gave
him,
was
damages,
why
wasn't
his
remedy
under
illinois
law
every
bit
as
adequate
as
it
was
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
so
really
you
feel
your
remedy
in
the
district
court
wasn't
adequate
either?
unknown
speaker
if
damages
is
all
he
could
get,
i
suppose
any
public
employer
can
illegally
fire
a
person,
can
fire
a
person
in
breach
of
contract.
but
the
person
has
only,
if
he's
a
probationary
teacher,
has
only
a
damages
remedy--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
that
right?
i
take
it
you
conceded
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
under
illinois
law?
he
gets
only
damages,
doesn't
he?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
constitution
requires
more?
unknown
speaker
are
you
contending
he
had
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
reinstatement?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
not
my
question.
illinois
law
provides
only
a
damage
remedy
and
that's
all
he
recovered
here.
do
you
contend
that
as
a
matter
under
the
fourteenth
amendment...
assume
you
had
a
clear
contractual
right
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law...
that
you
had
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
get
your
job
back?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
argument
at
least
was,
one
of
your
arguments
was,
that
until
he
had
a
pre-deprivation
hearing
he
was
entitled
to
stay
on
the
job.
unknown
speaker
and
that
on
that
basis
if
they'd
have
given
him
a
pre-deprivation
hearing
they
would
have
to
at
the
end
of
that
hearing
have
complied
with
illinois
law,
and
he
may
have
stayed
on
the
job
throughout
his
second
year.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
he
was
entitled
to
stay
on
the
job
and
receive
his
weekly
pay
or
monthly
pay
until
they
give
him
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
he
lost
his
job
by
a
3-2
vote,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
he
had
a
hearing
the
3-2
might
have
come
out
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
would
not
have
lost
his
job
at
all.
unknown
speaker
now,
tell
us
again,
where
does
that
right
to
a
hearing
come
from?
the
state
law
doesn't
provide
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
had
60
days
to
bring
a
suit
in
state
court
before
the
termination
of
his
first
year.
unknown
speaker
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
you
could
have
brought
it
in
the
state
court,
and
you
could
have...
and
you
said
you
had
some
sort
of
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
what...
you
might
have
been
able
to
get
an
injunction.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
could
have
brought
your
1983
suit
in
the
state
courts,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
take
it
the
state
court
would
have
to
apply
federal
law,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
federal
law
entitled
you
to
an
injunction
you
might
have
gotten
it.
unknown
speaker
even
though
if
you
had
a
count
for
a
state
remedy
you
can
only
get
damages.
unknown
speaker
you
might
have
faced
a
malpractice
suit.
unknown
speaker
why
would
edgar
county
be
so
unsympathetic
when
all
of
your
substantive
rights
are
based
on
illinois
law?
i
mean,
are
you
saying
illinois
jurors
wouldn't
enforce
illinois
law?
unknown
speaker
that
reason
has
certainly
been
traditionally
advanced,
the
idea
being
that
federal
courts
may
be
more
sympathetic
to
federal
law
claims.
but
here
your
claim
derives
almost
entirely
from
illinois
statute,
illinois
case
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
you
say
illinois
law
is
inadequate,
but
in
a
sense
illinois
is
perfectly
capable
of
defining
its
rights
and
assigning
what
procedures
all
he
available
to
enforce
them,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
recently.
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
on
logan
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
would
you
consider
judge
posner's
argument
about
the
paperclip
contract?
why
can't
the
same
considerations
be
effective
there:
that
the
company
loses
its
contract,
it
affects
its
business
reputation,
it
might
be
a
small
company
and
all.
would
your
argument
apply
to
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
isn't?
what
if
he's
a
small
business,
this
is
his
principal
customer,
and
as
soon
as
he
loses
this
account
he's
going
to
be
on
the
rocks
for
a
while
and
have
trouble
getting
other
accounts?
unknown
speaker
well,
turn
the
case
around
and
assume
your
client
was
a
millionaire.
would
he
not
have
a
claim
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
he
likes
to
coach.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
federal
remedy
must
have
been
a
great
disappointment
to
him,
just
as
the
state
remedy
was,
since
it
was
only...
it
would
have
been,
just
because
it
was
only
damages.
unknown
speaker
did
you
try
for
a
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
but
that
all
could
have
come
out
at
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
you
are
arguing
that
the
constitution
requires
a
pre-deprivation
hearing,
and
i
take
it
the
hearing
would
be
conducted
by
the
people
who
are
going
to
make
the
decision
to
fire
the
man?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it's
kind
of
a
notice
requirement
rather
than
a
hearing
requirement.
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
be
adequate
of
the
response
was
in
writing?
if
it's
all
done
in
writing,
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
you
lost
too
many
football
games.
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct,
then,
that
the
particular
procedure
that
the
constitution
commands
depends
pretty
much
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
controversy?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
board
had
said
to
him,
look,
it's
60
days
until
the
end
of
the
term,
we'll
see
you
in
court
and
we'll
make
all
the
explanation
we
have,
we'll
put
the
evidence
on
the
record,
and
if
we've
breached
our
contract
you'll
get
a
remedy,
i
suppose,
and
they
said
also,
we'll
guarantee
that
the
hearing
in
state
court
will
be
concluded
within
60
days.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
hasn't
yet.
it
won't
be--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
know.
but
if
it's
decided,
if
it's
decided
that
the
school
board
has
breached
the
contract
he's
going
to
get
his
damages
right
then,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is--
--isn't
his
best
chance
to
save
his
job
the
opportunity
to
convince
one
of
the
three
who
voted
against
him
that
he
should
change
his
mind?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
understand
why
you're
willing
to
settle
for
anything
less
than
a
hearing
of
some
kind
before
the
five
of
them
so
that
maybe
you
can
change
the
minds
of
one
of
the
three.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
him
to
lose
it.
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede
that
the
state
law
doesn't
provide
for
any
such
hearing,
but
that
the
constitution
mandates
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
illinois
followed
their
common
law
rule
of
lumley
against
wagner
and
said
contracts
for
personal
services
simply
are
not
enforceable,
specifically
enforceable,
and
they
applied
that
to
private
contractors
and
also
to
public
contractors
like
the
school
district
here.
do
you
say
that
the
due
process
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prevents
illinois
from
following
that
rather
well-established
rule?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
say
that
in
a
case
where
illinois
followed
the
rule
that
contracts
for
personal
services
are
not
specifically
enforceable,
that
1983
and
the
due
process
clause
says
then
a
federal
court
or
a
state
court
acting
under
the
federal
constitution
may
specifically
enforce
contracts
for
personal
services?
unknown
speaker
when
did
that
change
occur?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
most
courts
had
felt
that
lumley
against
wagner
was
quite
a
viable
rule,
not
just
for
150
years,
but
right
up
until
today.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
lumley
rule,
it's
a
rule
of
contracts
that
says
contracts
for
personal
services
generally
are
not
specifically
enforceable.
you
can
get
damages,
but
you
can't
force
your
employer
to
retain
your
services
when
he's
decided
he
doesn't
want
them.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
believe
it's
a
well-recognized...
did
you
take
contracts
in
law
school?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
they
didn't
treat
it
there.
but
when
i
went
to
law
school
it
was
a
rule
of
contract
damages:
you
could
not
get
specific
performance
of
a
breach
of
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
what
case
from
this
court
has
changed
it
so
that
state
courts
can
no
longer
apply
lumley
against
wagner?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
case
says
that
a
federal
court
may
grant
specific
performance
of
a
contract
for
personal
services
where
the
state
followed
a
rule
that
you
could
not
have
specific
performance?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
a
case
in
this
court
that
says
that
is
the
meaning
and
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act?
unknown
speaker
did
congress
say,
you
shall
have
in
federal
court
under
1983
a
right
to
specific
performance
of
a
contract
for
personal
services?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
when
you
say
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
until
this
minute
i
had
understood
all
you
were
complaining
about
is
that
you
didn't
get
a
pre-deprivation
hearing,
meanwhile
hanging
onto
the
job
with
the
hope
that
at
the
hearing
you
could
charge
somebody's
mind.
i
didn't
know
that
you
were
after
specific
performance
of
anything.
unknown
speaker
but
all
you
want's
a
hearing,
a
pre-deprivation
hearing,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
about
that
hearing
if
you
got
it
now?
unknown
speaker
so
damages
is
the
only
available
remedy?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
have
done
if
when
you
got
the
notice
of
termination,
when
your
client
got
the
notice
of
termination,
the
board
had
said:
should
you
care
to
have
a
hearing
before
us,
please
show
up
next
monday
night
at
6:00
o'clock.
and
so
he
showed
up
and
you
went
completely
through
the
whole
thing
and
the
board
said:
well,
we
don't
think
we're
breaking
illinois
law,
but
even
if
we
are
you're
fired,
and
now
if
you
want
a
remedy
go
to
court
someplace,
because
all
you
can
get
are
damages.
now,
suppose
that
had
happened.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
ever,
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
he
ever
ask
why
he
was
fired?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
ansel,
even
if
he
had
had
the
hearing
the
school
board
would
not
have
been
required
to
give
him
their
reasons,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
question.
i
know
your
light
is
on,
but
supposing
this
were
a
private
employer
and
they
fired
a
football
coach
and
they
followed
precisely
the
procedure
that
was
done
here
and
then
he
sued
later
and
so
forth.
would
that
individual
receive
due
process
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
miller,
if
the
law
were
perfectly
clear,
and
i
don't
suggest
it
is,
that
the
constitution
required
a
public
employer
to
give
a
pre-termination
hearing...
say
that
was
clearly
the
law...
and
you
fired
a
man
without
giving
him
such
a
hearing,
he
promptly
went
into
federal
court
and
asked
for
an
injunction,
saying
i
want
that
hearing
before
the
discharge
becomes
effective,
are
you
saying
a
federal
court
would
not
in
those
circumstances
have
power
to
enter
a
temporary
restraining
order?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
meet
the
claim
that
he
wants
the
chance
to
give
his
side
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
deny
that
the
board
refused
him
the
opportunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
certainly
close
to
your
state
law
argument
now.
