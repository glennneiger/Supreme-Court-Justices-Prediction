mr.
marc
j.
ansel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
an
employee
of
state
government
who
is
discharged
in
the
middle
of
his
term
without
reasons
or
an
explanation
is
entitled
to
those
reasons
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
at
a
meaningful
time
and
in
a
meaningful
manner.
the
petitioners'
argument
in
this
case
reduces
to
two
basic
propositions:
number
one,
there
is
no
federal
claim
because
there
is
no
state
claim;
number
two,
there
is
no
federal
claim
because
there
is
a
state
claim.
this
inherent
inconsistency
in
the
argument
provides
no
help
in
balancing
the
many
interests
that
have
to
be
weighed
in
a
due
process
analysis.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
in
fact,
none
of
the
elements
of
the
protectable
interest
come
from
any
place
but
illinois
law.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
well,
it
is
more
than
a
diversity
case,
only
because
of
the
question
of
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
or
some
type
of
pre-deprivation
process
under
the
constitution.
that
is
what
changes
it
and
that
question
is
not
a
question
of
illinois
contract
law.
this
is
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
i
can
rely
on
the
findings
of
the
two
lower
courts
and
say
that
it
does,
because
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
reach
the
heart
of
this
case,
which
is
what
process
is
actually
due,
given
a
protectable
interest.
this
case
involves
a
claim
against
a
school
district,
which
is
a
government
employer,
and
in
the
case
the
respondent
proved
an
explicit
commitment
from
the
highest
governing
authorities
and
a
breach
of
that
commitment.
this
could
be
termed,
and
it
has
been
termed,
a
squabble
between
a
teacher
and
a
school
board
in
the
dissent
below.
but
in
constitutional
terms,
this
epitomizes
the
arbitrary
actions
that
are
occasionally
committed
by
state
government
without
any
adequate
remedy.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
the
only
remedy
provided
by
illinois
law.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
the
absence
of
an
explicit
provision
in
illinois
law
for
a
hearing
does
not
mean
that
a
hearing
could
not
be
provided.
but
the
constitutional
question
is
whether
or
not
a
deprivation
in
the
middle
of
a
term
where
there
is
an
expectancy
remaining
invokes
the
constitutional
right
to
a
pre-deprivation
hearing.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
i
think
it
should,
and
in
this
case
the
reliance,
based
on
every
fact
in
the
record,
would
be
a
reasonable
reliance.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
it's
reasonable
to
expect
a
hearing
because
hearings
are
provided
for
all
teachers
that
are
terminated
in
the
middle
of
their
terms,
because
cause
is
an
element
of
that
termination.
the
petitioner,
when
he
indicated
those
reasons
that
could
constitute
termination
in
the
middle
of
a
term,
even
a
reason
as
amorphous
as
the
interests
of
the
district,
still
is
sufficient
to
generate
a
cause
requirement.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
cases
in
this
court
have
indicated
that
if
somebody
is
provided
with
a
protectable
interest
as
determined
by
reference
to
state
law
the
question
of
whether
the
procedures
are
sufficient
to
deprive
them
of
that
interest
is
a
constitutional
question.
this
was
most
recently
stated
in
the
logan
case.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
believe
that
he
would
have
had
a
damages
remedy
under
illinois
law.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
our
choice
not
to
appeal
the
award
of
damages
for
failure
to
provide
additional
elements
should
not
be
taken
as
an
indication
by
us
that
those
are
adequate.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
that
is
true,
and
the
reason
is
more
complicated
than
might
first
appear.
the
first
reason
is,
by
the
time
the
case
was
able
to
be
brought
to
trial
even
in
the
federal
court
and
by
the
time
the
evidence
was
able
to
be
generated
with
the
help
of
judicial
process,
the
interest
that
he
had
remaining
in
one
additional
year's
employment
had
for
all
practical
purposes
dissipated.
he
had
begun
to
look
for
other
work.
they
had
already
hired
another
employee.
but
this
case
is
limited
to
those
circumstances
because
the
interest
remaining
at
the
time
was
only
one
year,
and
the
realities
of
litigation
even
in
federal
court
are
such
that
it's
sometimes
impossible
to
obtain
complete
restoration
of
what
is
lost
when
that
deprivation
takes
place.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--no,
i
do
not
concede
that
compensatory
damages
in
a
breach
of
contract
claim
are
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct,
but
i
do
not
concede
that
that
is
adequate.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
the
constitution
requires
more
in
terms
of
the
deprivation
process,
because
the
remedy
is
so
inadequate
under
illinois
law.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
illinois
common
law
to
provide
additional
remedies.
i
think
the
constitutional
analysis
requires
an
evaluation
of
those
remedies
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
are
adequate
is
significant
to
due
process
analysis.
it
is
significant
because
it
has
a
direct
bearing
on
the
value
of
any
additional
safeguards
that
would
be
provided
in
the
due
process
procedure.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i'm
contending
that,
if
he
had
a
protectable
interest,
the
civil
rights
act
does
provide
that
as
one
remedy.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
am
not
contending
that
there's
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
get
the
job
back.
but
i
am
contending
that
the
civil
rights
act,
which
is
the
implementing
statute
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
has
extended
the
power
to
the
federal
courts
to
provide
these
additional
remedies
when
they
are
not
available
in
state
court.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
am
not
contending
that
the
reinstatement
remedy
alone
would
provide
him
with
due
process.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
that
was
the
vote
when
he
was
terminated.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
in
my
opinion
the
very
essence
of
procedural
process.
that
is--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--that
is
correct.
the
opportunity
to
respond
after
being
provided
with
reasons
could
generate
the
opportunity
to
change
one
board
member's
mind.
and
the
real
loss
that
comes
from
the
deprivation
of
employment--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--the
right
to
a
hearing
comes
from
the
civil
rights
act
if
state
law
provides
a
protectable
interest.
if
state
law
provides
a
protectable
interest,
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
court
both
found
in
this
case,
whether
state
process
is
adequate
is
a
question
of
constitutional
law.
this
was
one
of
the
statements
in
the
logan
case.
otherwise,
if
the
only
process
due
was
that
process
provided
by
illinois
law,
the
states
would
be
able
by
means
of
state
legislation
to
destroy
any
legitimately
created
claim
by
simply
providing
and
limiting
the
process
in
its
statutes.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
we
did
bring
suit
within
60
days.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
no,
sir.
we
brought
suit
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
the
only
remedy--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
authority
in
illinois
law
for
an
injunction
under
these
circumstances.
i
agree
with
petitioners
in
that
situation.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
i
could
have
brought
my
1983--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
that
is
correct.
we
could
have
raised
the
federal
questions
in
state
court,
and
that
would
have
empowered
the
state
court
to
provide
the
additional
relief
that
was
available
under
the
civil
rights
act.
however,
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
and
authority
is
such
that
we
would
be
permitted
to
go
directly
to
federal
court,
and
i
think
to
have
had
a
trial
under
the
circumstances
of
this
firing
in
edgar
county,
illinois,
in
paris,
illinois,
would
have
raised
serious
questions
of
whether
or
not
this
claimant
would
have
been
able
to
receive
the
real
process
that
he
might
be
do.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
among
other
things,
i
might
have
faced
a
malpractice
suit,
that
is
true.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
am
saying
that
there
is
a
real
question,
when
you
get
into
litigation
in
the
state
courts,
of
all
of
the
vagaries
of
the
statute
of
frauds
and
parole
evidence
and
even
findings
of
fact
and
statements
made
in
the
record,
and
i
believe
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
allowing
dual
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
civil
rights
is
to
be
able
to
avoid
some
of
the
passion
and
personal
prejudice
that
might
exist
in
state
courts.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
arises
from
illinois
case
law
is
the
interest
or
the
claim
of
entitlement
that
we
seek
to
protect
in
this
case.
the
procedures
that
are
not
provided
by
illinois
law,
which
we
believe
are
required
by
the
constitution
and
authorized
by
the
civil
rights
act,
are
procedures
that
would
make
up
for
the
inadequacy
in
illinois
law.
so
we
do
start--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--yes,
they
are,
but
the
question
of
adequacy
of
those
procedures
is
one
of
constitutional
dimensions.
at
least
it
has
been
so
held
by
the
court.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
the
adequacy
of
remedy--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--that
is
logan.
the
adequacy
of
the
remedy
provided
post-deprivation
requires
an
analysis
of
what
process
is
available
and
what
process
is
feasible
at
different
points
in
time
during
the
deprivation
process,
and
at
what
cost.
this
is
simply
another
way
of
stating
the
four
elements
of
due
process
analysis
that
were
identified
in
mathews
and
eldridge
and
used
most
recently
in
logan.
if
the
post-deprivation
remedies
in
this
case
were
truly
complete,
that
is,
if
the
claimant
could
have
restored
to
him
all
that
would
be
lost
in
the
initial
deprivation,
then
the
deprivation
might
not
be
deemed
final,
in
that
he
could
literally
have
restored
what
was
taken
away.
but
when
that
interest
is
something
more
than
a
hobby
kit
or
an
item
of
tangible
property,
when
that
interest
is
one
of
employment,
it
is
not
so
easy
of
analysis
to
say
what
is
a
complete
remedy.
when
somebody
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
work,
the
deprivation
and
the
loss
can
never
be
made
complete.
the
longer
the
person
stays
off
the
job,
particularly
if
he
doesn't
keep
receiving
his
salary,
if
it
has
a
blot
on
his
employment
record,
if
it
takes
away
his
opportunity
to
work
and
generate
a
better
employment
record
for
looking
for
future
employment--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--it
would...
the
analysis
would
apply,
but
i
believe
the
result
would
be
different.
i
don't
believe
in
that
situation,
where
the
nature
of
the
private
at
stake
is
so
very
different
than
the
private
interest
in
employment...
a
person
who
may
have
a
contract
to
sell
paperclips
to
the
school
district
in
all
reality
probably
has
many
such
contracts
and
probably
is
a
purveyor
of
a
product,
who
has
no
more
expectation
than
an
economic
one.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
if
the
interest
at
stake,
the
private
interest
at
stake
were
truly
substantial,
as
the
hypothetical
you
might
prescribe,
then
perhaps
an
ear
should
be
given
to
whether
that
interest
is
substantial
enough
to
require
a
simple
explanation.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
he
may
very
well
have
a
claim,
because
the
difference
between...
the
impact
on
him
is
a
more
tangential
question
than
evaluating
the
private
interest
of
employment.
chances
are
if
he
had
those
economies
he
probably
wouldn't
have
even
bothered
to
try
and
go
in
and
get
reinstated
unless
he
felt
he
was
wronged.
i
don't
think--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--well,
i
think
he
does,
and
i
think
he
likes
to
teach,
and
i
think
that
therein
lies
the
difference
between
the
paperclip
and
teaching.
there
is
a
real
expectation
on
the
part
of
teachers
that
part
of
their
consideration
is
the
opportunity
to
teach.
this
is
understood
by
all
parties
and
was
up
understood
in
this
case.
the
respondent
left
a
job
that
paid
him
more
money.
he
left
a
job
he
had
held
for
13
years.
and
this
was
not
a
unilateral
expectation.
this
was
understood
by
both
sides.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
the
disappointment
that
my
client
had
was
in
how
long
it
took
us
to
be
able
to
generate
the
evidence
necessary
to
seek
relief
and,
with
the
one
year
that
he
had
remaining
as
an
expectancy,
the
realities
of
federal
litigation
and
the
limits
of
his
interest
made
it
impossible
to
go
for
reinstatement.
if
we
had
had
all
the
school
board
members
tell
the
same
story,
we
probably
could
have
gotten
an
injunction
a
week
later.
but
when
we
had
four
school
board
members
deny
and
forget
what
the
conversation
was
and
we
had
only
two
school
board
members
admit
that
the
promise
was
made,
the
realities
of
litigation
prohibited
us
in
this
case
from
getting
the
full
relief.
and
he
was
disappointed.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
did
not
try
for
a
preliminary
injunction
until
i
could
determine
what
was
going
to
be
said
by
the
school
board
members,
and
that
was
easily
found
out
because
i
was
told
right
at
the
very
beginning
that
two
board
members
were
going
to
say
that
the
promise
was
made
by
all
of
them
and
four
board
members
were
going
to
deny
that
that
promise
was
made.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
it
could
have,
and
i
think
at
that
point
in
time
we
might
very
well
have
had
a
hearing
that
would
have
indicated
the
likelihood
of
prevailing
on
the
merits.
i
hope
my
client
will
not
have
it
cost
him
because
i
might
have
failed
to
generate
the
evidence
that
was
necessary
to
get
that
preliminary
injunction
in
that
two-month
period.
in
any
event,
the
adequacy
of
a
post-deprivation
remedy
depends
upon
many
other
factors
and
interests
that
must
be
weighed
in
the
traditional
due
process
analysis,
and
i
think
if
one
of
the
other
statements
in
logan
is
that
those
post-deprivation
remedies
are
inadequate,
if
they
do
not
truly
make
him
whole,
then
the
deprivation
itself
is
considered
final
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
may
be
inadequate
remedies
remaining
at
state
law.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
in
fact,
i
am
arguing
less
than
that,
because
the
case
doesn't
require
me
to
say
that.
i
am
arguing
that
some
type
of
pre-deprivation
process,
an
explanation
of
reasons
and
an
opportunity
to
respond,
is
required,
given
the
nature
of
his
one-year
remaining
expectancy.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
it's
a
notice
of
reason
and
an
opportunity
to
respond.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
if
the
opportunity
to
respond
were
provided
in
writing,
and
depending
upon
what
the
reasons
were
it
might
be--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--i
think
under
those
circumstances
a
real
opportunity
to
change
their
minds
is
what
is
required,
and
i
might
question,
when
it
could
be
as
easily
provided
that
they
could
have
a
conference
as
writing
a
letter--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
because
certain
reasons
for
termination...
if
the
reason
was
only
that
the
football
record
was
not
a
good
enough
record,
then
perhaps
that
reason
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
generate
a
full-blown
adversarial
hearing.
but
if
the
reasons
are
such
that
they
raise
real
questions
of
fact
and
if
they
are
such
that
they
raise
real
questions
of
stigmatization
or
real
questions
that
would
have
a
blot
on
his
employment
record,
perhaps
something
more
than
the
opportunity--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--this
would
not
be
adequate
because
the
opportunity
to
work
has
still
been
taken
away.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
but
if
he
goes
to
court
and
wins
within
60
days,
the
only
thing
he
gets
is
money
damages.
he
does
not
get
to
teach
that
second
year,
which
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--yes,
he
is.
but
the
damages
in
our
opinion
are
not
adequate
because
he
is
not
made
whole.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
best
opportunity,
and
in
light
of
this--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--i
am
not.
i
want
the
opportunity
to
change
their
minds,
and
even
if
i
could
get
my
contract
damages
before
he
actually
loses
his
job,
he
has
still
lost
his
job.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
want
an
opportunity
to
determine
the
rightful
or
wrongful
nature
of
the
deprivation
before
its
lost.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
concede
that
state
law
does
not
provide
it
and,
considering
how
easy
it
would
be
to
provide
him
with
reasons
and
considering
how
much
risk
there
is
of
a
wrongful
deprivation
when
he
could
be
terminated
with
no
reasons,
that
the
constitution
requires
it.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
don't
think
that
the
due
process
law
prevents
illinois
from
following
its
own
remedies.
i
think
due
process
as
implemented
through
the
civil
rights
act
empowers
the
federal
and
state
courts
under
federal
law
to
provide
additional
remedies
where
state
remedies
are
inadequate.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
change
you're
talking
about?
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
the
lumley
rule
is
the
one
that
states
that
federal
courts
can
provide
no
addition--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--and
this
is
a
principle
of
federal
law?
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
i
did.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
and
i
think
this
is
the
rule
of
illinois
law.
i
think
this
is
the
common
law
in
illinois.
but
i
think
that
in
light
of
the
interest
at
stake
in
the
case
of
employment,
contract
damages
are
an
inadequate
remedy.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
the
state
courts
can
apply
it
unless
the
civil
rights
act
is
the
basis
for
the
cause
of
action.
in
that
case,
we
invoke
the
powers
of
the
court
granted
by
that
act.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
this
is
the
meaning
and
the
intent
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
have
nothing
more
than
the
remedies
provided
by
the
legislature,
by
the
congress
when
they
granted,
the
civil
rights
act
passed.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
in
effect
they
did.
they
said--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--yes,
they
did,
when
they
said
that
the
equitable
powers
that
were
granted
by
the
civil
rights
act
would
empower
any
court
in
which
such
a
proceeding
was
brought
to
use
those
equitable
remedies.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i'm
not
after
specific
performance,
but
i'm
after
the
opportunity
to
remain
whole--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
if
we
got
it
now,
we
have
already
lost
the
opportunity
to
work
and
it
would
no
longer
be
adequate.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
in
my
case,
under
these
circumstances,
where
the
expectancy
was
only
one
more
year,
i
think
that
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
it
is
no
longer
practical
to
expect
reinstatement
on
the
part
of
either
petitioners
or
the
respondent.
if
i
might,
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
might
indicate
that
the
requirement
of
pre-deprivation
process
petitioners
say
would
increase
or
foster
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
we
believe
that
the
exact
opposite
is
true.
where
somebody
is
deprived
of
a
legitimate
claim
with
no
explanation
and
no
reason,
this
in
effect
encourages
litigation.
this
is
in
effect
taking
the
posture
of:
sue
me
if
you
want
to
know
why
or
if
you
want
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
but
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
--i
think
that
under
the
procedural
due
process
analysis
that
we
make
here
that
process
would
have
satisfied
due
process.
just
the
opportunity
to
be
told
why
and
respond,
just
a
chance
to
change
their
minds
before
this
very
real
loss
occurs
is
all
we
seek.
there
is
no
substantial
government
interest
in
that.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
yes,
he
did,
and
he
was
told:
we
don't
have
to
give
you
any
reasons.
the
lawyer
who
he
first
contacted
asked
for
the
reasons,
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
meet,
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
talk,
and
they
refused
to
grant
it.
this
is
what
caused
the
litigation
in
this
case.
pre-deprivation
process
would
narrow
the
issues.
in
many
cases
it
would
contribute
to
a
feeling
of
fairness.
and
if
this
court
were
to
require
it
when
somebody
is
deprived
of
a
loss
in
the
middle
of
their
term,
then
it
would
be
provided
in
future
cases.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
if
he
was
not
provided
with
reasons,
then
he
had
no
meaningful
opportunity
at
a
meaningful
time
and
there
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process.
the
most
fundamental
requirement
here
is
a
simple
explanation
of
why,
after
he
was
promised
two
years,
why.
that
is
not
a
heavy
burden.
mr.
marc
j.
ansel
i
understand
that
the
due
process
elements
would
not
be
applied
in
a
situation
of
private
employment,
and
i
understand
that
the
due
process
clause
was
intended
to
have
the
government
interact
with
the
citizens
on
a
higher
level
or
on
a
fundamentally
fair
level,
maybe
one
that
isn't
used
often
enough
in
private
business.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
my
time
is
up.
