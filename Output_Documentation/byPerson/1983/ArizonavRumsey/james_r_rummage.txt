mr.
james
r.
rummage
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
matter
that's
presently
before
this
court
is
actually
classic
case
of
double
jeopardy
and
it
falls
within
none
of
the
recognized
exceptions
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
after
the
sentencing
hearing
before
the
trial
court
in
this
matter,
a
hearing
which
amounts
to
a
trial,
there
was
a
final
verdict
of
acquittal
as
to
those
facts
which
were
at
issue.
on
his
appeal,
on
his
direct
appeal,
respondent
won
nothing.
he
certainly
did
not
win
a
retrial,
as
was
the
case
in
chaffin,
pearce,
stroud,
and
even
bullington.
there
is
no
justification
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
reviewing
respondent's
acquittal
at
that
sentencing
trial
and
allowing
the
state
to
retry
those
factual
issues
which
were
already
resolved
against
it.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
or--
mr.
james
r.
rummage
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
which
certainty
are
you
referring
to?
mr.
james
r.
rummage
yes,
your
honor.
well,
first
of
all,
of
course,
bullington
essentially
states
that.
in
bullington,
when
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
life,
this
court
stated
that
that
was
an
acquittal
as
to
the
death
penalty.
here,
we
have
even
more
certainty
that
there
was
an
acquittal.
the
court
made
the
finding...
and
i
think
this
is
important,
your
honor...
the
court
made
the
finding
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
this
offense
in
consideration
for
the
receipt
or
in
expectation
of
the
receipt
of
anything
of
pecuniary
value.
that,
to
respondent,
your
honor,
seems
to
be
about
as
direct
as
an
acquittal...
an
acquittal
as
there
can
be.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
or
trial
following
his
conviction
for
first
degree
murder,
dennis
wayne
rumsey
was
put
in
jeopardy
of
his
life.
depending
on
the
factual
determinations
made
by
the
trial
court,
he
would
either
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty
or
not
subject
to
it.
either
he
would
be
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
whatever
is
necessary
to
receive
the
death
penalty,
or
he
would
be
not
guilty.
in
its
special
verdict,
the
trial
court
announced,
as
required
by
arizona
law,
its
factual
findings
as
to
each
individual
aggravating
circumstance.
the
court
found
that
no
aggravating
circumstance
had
been
proven,
and
specifically
found,
as
i
just
mentioned,
that
the
offense
was
not
committed
for
pecuniary
gain
as
described
by
the
statute.
respondent
appealed,
the
state
cross-appealed.
the
only
issues
raised
by
respondent
on
his
direct
appeal
involved
the
consecutive
nature
of
his
sentences.
he
did
not
even
seek
to
have
his
convictions
overturned.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
well,
your
honor,
those
statements--
mr.
james
r.
rummage
--with
what
the
judge
had
said
elsewhere?
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
conflict,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
reason.
on
page
66,
he
essentially
was
stating
what
the
evidence
at
trial
was.
he
was
essentially
restating
that,
saying
that
mr.
rumsey
planned
a
robbery;
the
robbery
ended
up
with
this
guy
being
killed.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
yes,
your
honor.
"the
defendant
planned
this
robbery,
which
resulted
in
the
needless
death
of
an
individual
who
befriended
the
defendant
and
girlfriend,
in
order
to
obtain
what
the
defendant
knew
was
only
a
few
hundred
dollars,
to
possibly
obtain
the
victim's
car,
although
the
court
is
satisfied
the
primary
motive
was
to
receive
something
in
the
approximate
sum
of
a
few
hundred
dollars.
"
mr.
james
r.
rummage
well,
your
honor,
obviously
there
is
a
gain
or
an
intent
to
gain.
first
of
all,
the
court
did
not
state
that
the
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
gain.
the
court
stated
that
it
resulted
in
the
needless
death
of
the
individual,
but
not
that
the
purpose
of
the
murder
was
to
gain.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
an
aggravating
circumstance
as
to
the
armed
robbery.
and
i
need
to
answer
your
questions
and
finish
the
chief
justice's
answer
at
the
same
time.
as
far
as
finding
it
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
for
the
robbery,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
he
found
that
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
under
the
subsection
that
permits
finding
anything
that
is
appropriate
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
for
a
non-capital
crime.
he
did
not
find
that
as
an
aggravating
circumstance
under
the
statute
which
provides
that
the
crime
was
committed
for
pecuniary
gain.
that
leads
me
to
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
which
is
the
judge
at
trial
interpreted
the
statute,
and
i
think
subsections
4
and
5
are
read
together
by
him.
he
interpreted
the
statute
which
uses
that
pecuniary
gain
language
as
meaning
a
murder
for
hire.
and
again,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
this
is
not
some
sort
of
off-the-wall
interpretation.
it's
an
interpretation
that
was
shared
by
one
of
the
justices
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
at
the
time
the
issue
was
decided,
and
it's
an
interpretation
that
has
since
apparently
been
shared
by
another
one
of
the
members
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
so
it
is
not
a
totally
absurd
construction
of
the
statute.
this
is
the
construction
that
he
applied.
there
was
no
direct
interpretation
of
the
statute
at
the
time.
he
determined
that
factually,
these
facts
do
not
fit
into
that
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
well,
it
really
would,
your
honor.
i
think
it
perhaps--
mr.
james
r.
rummage
--that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
james
r.
rummage
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
though,
that
the
fact
that
it
is
not
an
absurd
construction,
or
at
least
was
not
considered
absurd
by
two
members
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
does
lend
some
strength
to
the
argument.
on
direct
appeal
or
on
the
state's
cross-appeal,
the
state
sought
review
of
the
trial
court's
failure
to
find
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravating
circumstance,
respondent
did
not
prevail,
obviously,
on
appeal
the
first
time.
the
state
did
prevail.
and
as
a
result,
the
state
was
allowed
to
conduct
a
new
presentence
hearing
at
the
which
the
state
attempted
once
again
to
prove
several
aggravating
circumstances
to
the
trial
court.
an
entirely
new
special
verdict
was
issued
in
which
the
trial
court,
essentially
citing
the
arizona
supreme
court's
first
opinion
in
this
matter,
found
that
the
pecuniary
gain
aggravating
circumstance
existed.
in
essence,
the
chronology
of
this
case,
as
far
as
the
sentencing
is
concerned,
was
this:
respondent
was
acquitted
of
those
things
necessary
for
the
death
penalty.
the
state
appealed
from
that
acquittal,
and
respondent
was
retried
and
then
convicted.
this
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
guarantees
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
whether
analyzed
in
terms
of
traditional
double
jeopardy
law
or
in
terms
of
the
particular
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
described
in
bullington
v.
missouri.
upon
his
conviction
for
first
degree
murder
alone,
respondent
could
not
be
given
the
death
penalty.
without
more,
life
was
the
only
possible
sentence.
before
the
death
penalty
could
be
imposed,
the
state
was
required
at
the
presentence
hearing
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
one
or
more
aggravating
factors.
the
trial
judge's
conclusion
in
his
special
verdict
that
none
of
those
aggravating
factors
existed
represented
a
resolution
in
respondent's
favor,
correct
or
not,
of
some
or
all
of
the
factual
elements
charged.
thus,
as
this
court
has
stated
more
than
once,
there
was
an
acquittal.
as
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
since
1896,
one
of
the
most
fundamental
rules
of
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence
is
that
a
verdict
of
acquittal
may
not
be
reviewed
without
putting
the
defendant
twice
in
jeopardy.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
there
was
no
acquittal
by
the
jury
in
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial;
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
it
is
different
from
difrancesco
for
a
number
of
reasons,
i
believe,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
one
that
is
significant
is
that
in
difrancesco,
there
is
a
statute
that
particularly
provided
for
appeal.
no.
2,
the
burden
of
proof
in
difrancesco
was
not
the
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
well,
your
honor,
that's
really
correct.
obviously,
there
can't
be
a
provision
for
appeal
if
it
violates
the
constitution.
mr.
james
r.
rummage
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
in
any
event,
difrancesco
is
distinguishable
from
the
present
case,
for
several
different
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
burden
of
proof
in
difrancesco
was
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
believe
it's
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
secondly,
the
choice
of
sentencing,
the
range
of
sentence
that
was
provided
to
the
sentencer
was
quite
large.
as
i
believe
was
the
case
in
difrancesco,
the
effect
of
the
sentence
that
he
received
for
being
a
dangerous
special
offender
was
an
additional
year
beyond
the
sentence
that
he
was
already
serving.
and
given
the
possibility
of
making
concurrent
sentences
as
they
were
in
difrancesco,
presumably
the
sentence
could
have
been
zero,
a
range
from
zero,
i
believe,
to
25
years.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
range
of
sentence.
it
is
one
or
the
other,
life
or
death,
just
as
it
would
be
guilty
or
innocent
at
a
trial
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
beyond
that,
in
difrancesco,
the
defendant
was
found
to
be
a
dangerous
special
offender.
and
the
appeal
that
the
government
took
was
essentially
an
appeal
from
the
length
of
the
sentence
that
was
imposed.
in
this
case,
when...
in
this
case,
mr.
rumsey
was
not
found
to
be
guilty
of
those
things,
the
aggravating
circumstances,
which
would
allow
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
so
that,
i
believe,
too,
is
a
significant
distinguishing
characteristic.
as
this
court
has
said,
the
law
attaches
a
particular
significance
to
an
acquittal.
an
acquittal
absolutely
shields
the
defendant
from
a
retrial.
to
permit
a
second
trial
after
an
acquittal,
however
mistaken,
would
present
an
unacceptably
high
risk,
as
this
court
has
stated,
that
the
innocent
may
ultimately
be
found
guilty.
these
considerations
all
apply
directly
to
the
case
before
this
court.
in
addition
to
those
general
double
jeopardy
considerations,
the
particular
considerations,
the
particular
analysis
that
was
presented
by
this
court
in
the
bullington
v.
missouri
decision
applies
to
this
case
as
well.
the
sentencing
here,
as
the
sentencing
in
bullington,
was
not
a
traditional
sentencing.
it
was
not
merely
a
decision
by
the
sentencer,
in
his
discretion
meting
out
what
he
felt
justice
required.
the
sentencer
here,
as
in
bullington,
had
the
choice
of
life
or
death,
essentially
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
those
things
that
could
result
in
the
death
penalty.
there
are
specific
standards
that
are
provided
to
the
sentencer
in
determining
whether
the
sentence
of
death
may
be
imposed
or,
in
arizona,
must
be
imposed.
and
finally,
the
burden
of
proof
regarding
those
aggravating
circumstances
is
on
the
state,
a
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
under
traditional
notions
of
double
jeopardy
law,
as
well
as
this
court's
holding
in
bullington
v.
missouri,
the
state
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
retry
the
respondent
a
second
time
on
the
issue
of
whether
his
first
degree
murder
was
a
first
degree
murder
with
aggravating
circumstances
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
petitioner
argues
that
the
arizona
sentencing
procedure
does
not
resemble
a
trial
sufficiently
to
call
the
double
jeopardy
clause
into
play.
obviously,
respondent
disagrees
with
that.
there
are
certain
objective
factual
issues
which
must
be
resolved
at
the
arizona
sentencing
hearing,
just
as
there
are
at
a
trial.
the
state
must
carry
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
those
factual
issues,
just
as
at
a
trial.
if
the
state
prevails
at
the
hearing,
the
authorized
punishment
of
death
must
be
imposed.
if
the
state
does
not
prevail,
the
authorized
punishment
cannot
be
imposed,
just
as
at
a
trial.
at
the
arizona
sentencing
hearing,
it
is
truly
an
issue
of
guilty
or
not
guilty
of
those
things
for
which
the
penalty
of
death
is
authorized.
petitioner
recites
in
his
brief
a
litany
of
minor
differences
between
the
arizona
and
missouri
capital
sentencing
procedures,
in
the
hope
of
convincing
the
court
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply
in
the
present
case,
as
it
does
in
bullington.
in
fact,
those
differences
that
do
exist
either
are
insignificant
to
the
double
jeopardy
issue
or
they
make
arizona's
procedure
even
more
like
a
trial
than
is
missouri's.
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
a
judge
is
a
fact
finder
in
arizona
makes
no
difference,
as
double
jeopardy
law
does
not
discriminate
between
bench
and
jury
trials.
contrary
to
petitioner's
assertion,
arizona
procedure
does
not
provide...
does
provide
for
an
argument
to
the
court...
essentially
a
closing
argument.
third,
the
fact
that
the
rules
of
evidence
do
not
apply
to
mitigation
in
arizona
is
not
significant.
what
is
significant
is
that
the
rules
of
evidence
apply
to
aggravating
circumstances,
those
things
which
must
be
proven
in
order
to
result
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
this
implies
that
the
risk
of
error
at
that
hearing
is
on
the
state.
another
distinction
that
petitioner
has
set
forth
is
that
aggravating
circumstances
that
are
found
in
missouri
must
separately
be
found
to
be
sufficient
to...
for
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
fact
that
this
is
not
the
case
in
arizona,
this
separate
proof
of
sufficiency
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
really
does
not
make
arizona's
procedure
less
like
a
trial.
at
a
regular
trial,
the
state
does
not
have
to
prove,
once
it's
proven
the
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
does
not
have
to
prove
separately
that
they
are
sufficient
for
a
conviction.
once
they
are
proven,
that
results
in
conviction.
finally,
the
fact
that
arizona's
procedure
does
not
allow
the
court
to
exercise
compassion
and
sentence
a
defendant
to
life,
even
though
the
state
has
proven
its
case,
makes
the
arizona
procedure
more
like
a
trial
than
missouri's.
never
at
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
is
the
jury
ever
instructed
that
even
though
they
find
the
state
has
proven
their
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
they
can
still
acquit
the
defendant.
the
petitioner
also
attempts
to
fit
the
present
case
into
the
mold
of
united
states
v.
difrancesco,
rather
than
the
mold
of
bullington.
all
the
similarities
that
this
case
shares
with
difrancesco
are
also
shared
with
bullington,
and
mean
nothing
with
regard
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i've
already
recited
in
my
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
the
differences
between
the
arizona
proceeding
and
the
proceeding
in
difrancesco
which
are
significant
to
this
issue.
petitioner
argues
that
the
arizona
sentencing
procedure
is
not
the
final
step.
this,
of
course,
is
true
only
when
the
death
penalty
is
imposed.
it
is
not
true
when
a
life
sentence
is
imposed,
as
was
made
abundantly
clear
in
the
arizona
supreme
court's
second
rumsey
opinion.
i
believe
this
touches
on
a
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
stevens
of
petitioner
regarding...
well,
which
was
answered
by
petitioner
by
referring
to
the
arizona
procedures
known
as
"special
action"
to
the
supreme
court.
petitioner
has
stated
that
this
is
an
open
question
in
arizona
as
to
whether
the
state
could
have
proceeded
by
means
of
special
action.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that,
given
the
fact
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
called
into
play,
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
special
action
law
could
be
used
or
not.
it
could
not,
under
double
jeopardy
considerations,
be
used.
petitioner
also
has
argued
that
the
arizona
death
sentencing
procedure
is
no
different
from
the
procedure
for
imposing
a
sentence
less
than
death.
in
fact,
respondent
would
submit
that
from
beginning
to
end,
the
procedures
are
totally
different.
there
is
notice
required
of
aggravating
circumstances
in
a
death
penalty
proceeding,
but
in
a
non-death
penalty
sentencing
proceeding
there
is
no
notice
required.
in
death
proceedings,
there
is
a
required
hearing
that
must
take
place.
in
non-death
penalty
proceedings,
there
is
no
required
hearing.
the
court
can
impose
an
aggravated
sentence
in
arizona
on
a
non-death
penalty
case
without
holding
any
hearing
at
all.
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
state
is
on
the
state
at
a
death
penalty
sentencing
proceeding
in
arizona
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
those
aggravating
factors
which
would
justify
the
death
penalty.
with
non-death
penalty
sentencing
procedures,
there
is
no
burden
on
the
state
to
prove
anything.
the
court
can
merely
find
the
aggravating
circumstances.
there
is
no
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
requirement.
the
choice
at
sentencings
other
than
death
penalty
sentencings
in
arizona
is
not
a
choice
between
life
and
death.
it's
a
broad
choice,
a
broad
range
of
sentences
from
which
the
sentencer
can
select.
the
aggravating
factors
in
a
death
penalty
sentencing
proceeding
are
limited
to
those
set
forth
in
the
statute,
but
in
a
non-death
penalty
sentencing
proceeding,
they
can
include
anything
that
the
court
deems
to
be
appropriate.
finally,
in
a
death
penalty
sentencing
proceeding,
a
special
verdict
is
required
at
which
the
sentencing
judge
must
set
forth
his
findings
as
to
each
and
every
aggravating
circumstance.
this,
of
course,
is
not
required
in
a
non-death
penalty
sentencing
procedure.
petitioner
states
that
if
the
arizona
procedure
does
amount
to
a
trial,
then
the
state
of
arizona
proved
its
case
at
the
first
hearing
and
that
the
judge
found
that
the
state
proved
its
case,
but
refused
to
find
it
to
be
an
aggravating
circumstance.
respondent,
again,
disagrees.
the
court
specifically
found
that
the
state
did
not
prove
its
case;
that
the
facts...
the
facts
proven
did
not
constitute
the
conduct
prescribed
by
the
statute.
petitioner
further
claims
that
the
state's
appeal
herein
was
the
same
as
an
appeal
from
an
erroneous
directed
verdict
after
a
guilty
verdict,
which
would
merely
require
reinstatement
of
the
verdict.
well,
respondent
is
at
a
loss
as
to
which
verdict
is
to
be
reinstated:
the
verdict
which
stated
that
the
defendant
did
not
commit
the
offense,
in
the
expectation
as
consideration
for
the
receipt
or
in
expectation
of
the
receipt
of
anything
of
pecuniary
value;
or
the
verdict
which
said
there
are
no
aggravating
circumstances;
or
the
verdict
which
said
the
defendant
shall
be
sentenced
to
life
rather
than
death.
clearly,
the
analogy
does
not
hold
up.
there
is
no
verdict
to
be
reinstated,
no
verdict
in
favor
of
the
state
that
can
be
reinstated.
the
only
verdict
is
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
petitioner
has
asked
this
court
to,
if
all
else
fails,
reconsider
the
bullington
rule.
respondent
would
submit
that
that
is
not
appropriate.
it
is
particularly
not
appropriate
in
this
case,
which
respondent
believes
presents
a
much
stronger
double
jeopardy
case
than
even
bullington
did.
in
any
event,
respondent
submits
that
bullington
does
not
blur
the
distinctions
between
trials
and
sentencings,
as
petitioner
has
argued.
there
is
a
clear
line
drawn
in
bullington.
bullington
says
that
when
the
sentencing...
when
the
factual
findings
that
lead
up
to
that
sentencing
constitute
a
trial,
when
there
are
particular
facts
that
must
be
proven
by
the
state
in
order
to
reach
the
determination
that
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
imposed,
and
when
those
factors
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
when
there
is
a
choice
between
only
two
alternatives,
then
you
don't
have
a
sentencing,
you
don't
have
the
mere
imposition
of
a
sentence,
you
have
a
trial,
you
have
a
factual
determination
by
the
finder
of
fact.
petitioner
made
a
very
noteworthy
comment
in
his
brief.
in
attempting
to
distinguish
this
sentencing
procedure
from
a
trial,
petitioner
stated
that
the
reason
the
rules
of
evidence
apply
to
aggravating
circumstances
and
the
reason
those
circumstances
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
to...
and
i
quote...
"require
more
credibility
and
reliability
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
death
sentence
may
rest.
"
no
doubt
this
last
statement
that
i
quoted
from
petitioner's
brief
is
true.
the
intent
here
was
to
require
more
credibility
and
more
reliability
of
the
facts
upon
which
the
death
penalty
may
rest.
this,
respondent
would
submit
to
the
court,
is
why
the
arizona
sentencing
procedure
resembles
a
trial.
these
are
the
same
things
that
are
required
at
a
trial,
because
the
determination
has
been
made
that
society,
the
state,
will
impose
upon
itself
almost
the
entire
risk
of
error.
this
certainly
must
even
be
more
true
when
the
death
penalty
is
the
final
verdict.
when
the
verdict
of
guilty
is
the
death
penalty,
it
must
be
more
true
than
in
any
other
criminal
trial.
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
therefore,
must
be
applied
to
this
case
and
it
absolutely
shields
the
respondent
from
the
retrial
which
resulted
in
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
thank
you.
