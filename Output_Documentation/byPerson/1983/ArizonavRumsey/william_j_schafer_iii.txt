mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
questions
the
propriety
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
ordering
a
resentencing,
following
a
life
sentence
that
was
imposed
after
the
sentencer
erroneously
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
that
one
of
the
statutory
aggravating
factors
was
not
applicable
to
this
case.
now,
the
facts
are
rather
simple.
dennis
rumsey
decided
to
rob
the
motorist
who
picked
him
up.
to
accomplish
that,
he
shot
him.
rumsey
was
convicted
of
both
murder
and
robbery.
at
the
separate
hearing
to
determine
the
sentence
for
murder,
the
state
offered
no
new
evidence
to
the
sentencer,
which
by
statute
in
arizona
is
the
trial
judge.
the
state
simply
referred
to
the
facts
that
had
already
been
proved
at
the
trial.
one
of
the
aggravating
factors,
the
state
felt
had
been
shown
by
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
the
trial,
was
that
the
killing
had
been
done
for
pecuniary
gain.
now,
without
deciding
whether
that
had
been
shown
or
not,
the
trial
judge
said
that
that
aggravating
factor...
pecuniary
gain...
applied
to
only
a
very
narrow
class
of
killers,
hired
killers,
and
it
had
no
application
to
a
robbery
murder
such
as
occurred
here.
the
state
at
the
initial
hearing
also
argued
two
other
aggravating
factors,
claimed
that
they
had
been
shown
by
the
evidence,
but
the
trial
judge
disagreed.
in
the
special
verdict
where
the
trial
judge
is
required
by
statute
to
list
his
findings
on
each
of
the
aggravating
factors
under
the
statute,
the
judge
found
that
there
were
none
present,
and
he
imposed
a
life
sentence
which
the
statute
requires
where
no
aggravation
has
been
shown.
the
judge
at
that
time
also
imposed
a
consecutive
sentence
for
the
robbery.
now,
both
sides
appealed
to
the
arizona
supreme
court;
mr.
rumsey
from
the
consecutive
sentences
that
had
been
imposed,
and
the
state
from
the
judge's
legal
ruling
that
the
pecuniary
gain
circumstance
applied
only
to
hired
killers.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
we
would
not
have
under
the
appeal
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
no.
i
don't
below
the
second
follows
from
the
first.
it
is
conceivable,
and
i
believe
still
an
open
question
in
arizona
as
to
whether
the
state
could
have
sought
a
special
action.
that
has
not
been
tested
in
the
state
court
yet
on
this
kind
of
a
point.
there
are...
i
answered
your
first
question
directly
to
appeal.
under
the
appeal
statute,
we
could
not
have.
and
that
was
discussed
in
the
second
rumsey
opinion.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
there
is
an
action,
which
is
called
in
the
rules
"special
action",
which
permits
the
state
or
the
defense,
either
part,
to
gain
a
hurry-up
decision
from
the
supreme
court
where
it
is
claimed
and
is
shown
that
there
has
been
abusive
discretion.
and
in
this
case,
that
may
well
have
been
sought,
had
the
opportunity
arisen.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
normally
it
is,
your
honor,
yes.
it
is
a
discretionary
procedure.
we,
as
well
as
rumsey
appealed,
and
ours
was
only
from
this
one
point,
the
legal
ruling
that
the
trial
judge
made
that
the
pecuniary
gain
factor
didn't
apply
to
this
case.
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
trial
judge
did
make
a
legal
error.
they
concluded
that
he
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
concluding
that
he
could
not
decide
that
particular
circumstance.
and
they
sent
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
resentencing.
now,
without
either
side
offering
any
evidence
at
the
resentencing,
the
trial
judge
then
found
that
the
pecuniary
gain
circumstance
had
been
shown.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
yes,
your
honor,
we
could
have.
and
with
that
finding,
the
judge
then
set
the
sentence
at
death.
rumsey's
appeal
was
then
automatic
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
reversed
itself
on
the
basis
of
bullington
v.
missouri.
the
state
sought
certiorari
because
of
its
belief
that
bullington
is
not
implicated
in
this
case,
because
there
has
been
no
acquittal
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
believe
that's
the
question
that
this
court
must
decide:
was
there
a
resolution
of
the
factual
issue
against
the
state?
we
contend
the
record
shows
that
there
was
not,
that
there
was
no
rejection
of
our
position
that
the
murder
was
for
monetary
or
pecuniary
gain.
the
reason
for
the
holding
in
bullington
was
that
the
state
of
missouri
had
a
full
and
a
fair
opportunity
to
muster
its
forces
and
to
present
its
case
to
the
sentencer.
and
in
that
case,
the
sentencer
rejected
the
case
of
the
state.
the
resolution
of
those
factual
issues
against
missouri
operated
as
an
acquittal.
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
gives
absolute
finality
to
acquittal,
missouri
could
not
be
given
another
opportunity
to
present
its
case
when
it
had
failed
to
make
its
case
the
first
time.
there
was
no
such
acquittal
here.
the
trial
judge
did
not
decide
the
factual
issue
of
pecuniary
gain
against
the
state.
the
only
thing
he
decided
in
regard
to
that
murder
was
that
he
was
not
going
to
reach
the
factual
issue,
because
it
simply
didn't
apply
in
the
case.
now,
unlike
missouri's
appeal--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
--i
do
not
believe
further
proceedings
are
necessary
at
this
point,
your
honor.
the
relief
we
would
ask
for
is
that
you
overturn
the
arizona
supreme
court
opinion
and
allow
them
to
go
forward
with
the
appeal.
the
appeal
from
the
death
sentence
has
never
been
held.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
i
do
at
a
further
point
in
the
brief,
i
believe,
your
honor,
which
is
page
66
of
the
joint
appendix.
now,
specifically,
what
i'm
referring
to
in
the
brief...
and
i
pointed
it
out
perhaps
in
a
footnote
in
the
brief...
is
that
in
regard
to
the
robbery,
the
trial
judge
made
what
i
considered
a
finding
as
to
pecuniary
gain,
a
finding
that
the
robbery
and
the
murder
were
actually
one
act.
the
same
force
was
used
to
accomplish
both.
and
if
you
read
what
the
trial
judge
did
at
66,
and
especially...
page
66
of
the
joint
appendix...
if
you
combine
it
with
other
things
that
were
before
the
trial
judge,
i
believe
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
in
his
mind
he
had
concluded
that
the
murder
was
for
pecuniary
gain,
that
the
case
of
the
murder
was
the
robbery,
which
our
supreme
court
has
defined
under
the
murder
statute
as
the
definition
of
pecuniary
gain.
now,
a
little
earlier
when
i
spoke,
i...
i
believe
made
the
statement
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
a
factual
determination
in
regard
to
the
murder.
i
tried
to
be
clear
in
the
brief
to
show
that
his
conclusion
was
really
stated
when
he
was
sentencing
for
the
robbery
and
not
for
the
murder.
my
point
is
that
i
believe
the
entire
record
shows
that
there
was
no
question
in
his
mind
that
he
believed,
if
he
could
have
considered
that
circumstance,
that
the
murder
was
for
pecuniary
gain.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
i
distinguish
it
like
this,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
there
was
no
acquittal
here.
in
scott
and
other
cases
from
this
court,
there
was
an
actual
acquittal.
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
that
terminated
the
proceedings
against
the
state,
as
this
court
said
last
week
in
lydon.
there
was
nothing
to
show
there
but
termination.
the
only
thing
that
could
approach
being
an
acquittal
here
was
the
trial
judge's
statement
that
"i
am
not
even
going
consider
this.
"
although
i
am
paraphrasing,
of
course.
and
he
went
ahead,
then,
and
finished
with
the
sentencing,
as
he
is
required
to
do
by
statute,
without
even
getting
to
that
aggravating
factor.
my
point
is
that--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
--yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
i
think
i
have
a
problem,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
your
honor,
that
even
with
bullington
and
all
of
the
language
in
bullington,
we
can
argue,
reasonably
so,
that
there
was
no
acquittal.
bullington
does
require
an
acquittal.
there
was
an
acquittal
in
bullington
of
death,
of
course,
but
we
have
no
such
acquittal
here.
we
have
no
such
termination
of
the
case
against
the
state,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
if
we
had
no
method
of
appeal,
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
have
to--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
--at
the
state...
well,
i
would--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
--i
would
not
like
to
concede
that,
but
logically,
your
honor,
i
believe
i'd
have
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
termination
in
our
favor
because
we
could
go
nowhere
from
that.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
i
think
it
would
be
under
your
greene
opinion.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
i
believe
under
greene,
he
could
not
be.
he
would
have
been
acquitted
of
first
degree
murder,
which
would--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
--or
the
statute
does
not
say
that
at
all,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
there
is
no
acquittal
in
this
case.
there
is
no
acquittal
as
there
would
be
in
the
hypothetical
you've
asked
me.
there
is
a
decision
by
the
trial
judge
to
avoid
any
termination
of
proceedings
on
this
particular
point
on
pecuniary
damage.
unlike
missouri's
appeal,
the
state's
appeal
here
and
the
relief
given
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
did
not
involve
the
state
proving
its
case
all
over
again.
in
bullington,
missouri
said
it
was
going
to
do
that.
that's
exactly
what
it
said:
we
are
going
to
prove
the
case
that
we
presented
before.
but
arizona
did
not
have
to
represent
its
case.
the
facts
of
its
case
had
already
been
presented
and
proved
at
the
trial.
what
arizona
asked
for
in
its
appeal
was
to
correct
the
error
that
had
been
made,
and
in
that
sense
it
was
much
like
the
appeal
the
government
took
in
the
difrancesco
case.
that
appeal
was
to
correct
an
error
by
the
sentencer,
and
that
appeal
was
upon
the
record
that
was
made
in
the
sentencing
court.
that's
the
same
thing
that
was
done
here
by
the
state
of
arizona.
if
the
controlling
consideration
behind
the
double
jeopardy
clause
where
there
is
an
acquittal,
is
to
prevent
the
government
oppression
that
would
come
with
repeated
efforts
to
convict
and
to
make
up
its
deficiencies
in
the
state's
case
with
each
new
effort
of
reprosecution,
then
applying
the
double
jeopardy
clause
here
would
not
accomplish
that.
once
jeopardy
attaches,
before
a
defendant
can
claim
that
there
has
been
a
second
jeopardy
to
which
he
has
been
put,
he
just
show
that
the
first
jeopardy
was
terminated.
but
it
was
not
terminated
here.
and
i
believe,
absent
that,
bullington
really
does
not
apply
to
this
fact
situation.
if
my
argument
has
been
unpersuasive,
if
the
court
feels
that
bullington
must
be
applied
to
this
case,
then
i
urge
the
court
to
reconsider
its
holding
in
bullington.
in
difrancesco,
this
court
recognized
that,
historically,
double
jeopardy
principals
had
not
been
applied
to
sentencing
proceedings.
there
is
a
fundamental
difference,
said
the
court,
between
the
two
procedures
that
required
that.
and
we
have
the
pearce,
chaffin,
and
the
stroud
decisions
that
recognize
that
distinction.
and
stroud
involved
a
death
sentence
after
a
life
sentence.
bullington
did
not
overrule
stroud.
it
was
felt
that
there
was
no
need
to
overrule
stroud,
that
what
distinguished
the
two
cases
were
the
number
of
trial
protections
given
in
bullington
that
were
not
present
in
stroud.
the
effect
of
that
recognition
is
that
the
more
trial
attributes
a
state
builds
into
its
sentencing
procedure,
the
more
likely
it
is
to
lose
the
ability
to
eliminate
aberrant
sentences
like
that
given
to
dennis
rumsey.
since
1972
and
the
furman
case,
we,
the
states
who
have
death
penalties,
have
been
doing
what
we
can
to
eliminate
aberrant
death
sentences.
bullington,
i
believe,
impedes
that
progress.
if
a
state
today
were
to
draft
a
new
death
penalty
statute,
and
it
wanted
to
do
the
most
that
it
could
to
produce
an
informed
and
a
rational
final
sentence,
it
would
want
to
retain
some
kind
of
review
flexibility.
the
only
way
that
it
could
cope
with
bullington
in
that
regard
would
be
to
write
into
its
procedures
as
few
trial
attributes
as
possible
to
take
it
away
from
the
holding
in
bullington,
and
perhaps
return
it
to
a
case
like
difrancesco
or
stroud.
and
that
would
not
be
the
signal
that
should
be
sent
to
such
a
state.
our
argument
is
that
bullington
does
not
apply
because
there
has
been
no
final
termination
factually
against
the
state's
point.
and
with
that,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii,
no,
i
have
not.
