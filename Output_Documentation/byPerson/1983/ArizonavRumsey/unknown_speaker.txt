unknown
speaker
mr.
schafer,
may
i
ask
right
there,
would
the
state
have
had
the
right
to
appeal
if
the
defendant
had
not
appealed?
unknown
speaker
so
that,
had
he
not
appealed,
we
never
could
have
reached
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
other
statutory
method
of
review
in
arizona
by
which
the
prosecution
can
get
a
review
of
the
sentences?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
available
in
a
case
where
there
would
be
no
appellate
review
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schafer,
could
the
state
and
the
defense
offered
evidence
that
there
be
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
this
means,
i
suppose,
mr.
schafer,
that
further
proceedings
are
necessary
then?
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief,
on
page
19,
you
say
that
the
trial
court
found
that
rumsey
committed
the
crime
for
pecuniary
gain.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
cite
to
the
record
on
that.
is
there
a
place
in
the
record
that
you
can
support
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schafer,
what
do
you...
how
do
you
distinguish
the
language
of
this
court
in
united
states
v.
scott
when
it
said
that
the
fact
that
the
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case
may
result
from
an
erroneous
evidentiary
ruling
or
erroneous
interpretation
of
governing
legal
principals
affects
the
accuracy
of
the
determination,
but
it
doesn't
alter
its
character?
in
other
words,
even
though
an
acquittal
might
be
based
on
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
law,
it's
binding
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
death
sentencing
curing
is
given
similar
characteristics,
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
problem,
of
course,
is
that
bullington
has
treated
the
sentencing
hearing
as
much
like
a
trial
for
purposes
of
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
why,
when
you
combine
bullington
with
scott,
you
have
a
problem,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schafer,
doesn't
that
argument
depend
on
your
being
right
about
the
special
action
being
a
method
of
review?
because
if
you
could
not
have
appealed
independently,
could
it
not
be
said
that
the
case
on
sentencing
was
over
against
the
state?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
have
been
equivalent
to
an
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
so
that
doesn't
the
case
under
your
approach
really
require
us
to
decide
whether
you
did
have
this
method
of
review
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
well,
try
this
one.
assuming
that
the
court
finds
that
you're
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
but
not
first
degree
murder,
is
that
an
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
statute
says
of
the
state
of
podunk
that
people
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
are
sentenced
to
life
automatically,
and
people
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
are
sentenced
to
death
automatically,
and
the
court
finds
him
guilty
of
second
degree
murder?
could
he
later
be
found
guilty,
and
death?
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
between
that
and
this
case
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
it
specifically.
unknown
speaker
any
other
reason?
unknown
speaker
which
of
our
cases
would
you
think
makes
this
certainty
that
you've
just
asserted?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
certainty
that
this
was
an
acquittal,
that
it
was
the
functional
equivalent,
take
it
you
said,
of
an
acquittal.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
the
statements
of
the
trial
judge
at
page
66
of
the
joint
appendix
that
your
friend
alluded
to
earlier?
unknown
speaker
seems
to
be
somewhat
in
conflict
with
what
he
said
elsewhere,
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
he
was
a
little
more
specific
than
that,
wasn't
he?
i
don't
have
it
at
hand.
you
might
read
that.
it's
in
the
lower
part
of
the
page.
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
like
a
homicide
for
gain,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rummage,
how
about...
take
the
paragraph
right
after
the
one
where
you
were
reading,
at
the
top
of
page
67.
there,
he
does
say
it
was
an
aggravating
circumstance,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
would
be
the
same,
even
if
it
was
absurd.
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
supreme
court
had
already
construed
the
statute,
and
the
trial
judge
just
didn't
know
about
it
and
construed
it
himself,
contrary
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
would
still
be
here,
taking
the
same
position.
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
be
taking
the
same
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rummage,
in
arizona
there
is
a
separate
verdict
returned
by
the
jury,
is
there,
or
the
guilt,
nonguilt
phase?
unknown
speaker
and
then
it
simply
goes
to
the
trial
judge
and
he
alone
does
the
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
the
acquittal
on
the
sentencing
issue
that
you're
talking
about
here.
there
was
no
acquittal
on
the
guilt.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
this
is
different
from
difrancesco
because
it's
a
capital
case,
and
therefore
it
comes
under
bullington?
unknown
speaker
whether
there's
a
statute
that
provides
for
appeal
is
basically
a
question
of
state
law,
isn't
it,
or
federal
law?
how
would
that
affect
the
constitutional
issue?
unknown
speaker
no.
if
congress
provides
tomorrow
that
the
government
can
appeal
from
any
jury
verdict
of
not
guilty,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
okay.
