unknown

but
after
his
acceptance.
unknown

under
arkansas
law,
who
makes
the
final
decision
on
sentences?
unknown
speaker
and
on
the
acceptance
of
pleas?
unknown
speaker
he
can
reject
it
if
he
wishes?
unknown
speaker
general
clark,
is
the
defendant
now
released
from
custody?
unknown
speaker
and
served
how
much
time?
unknown
speaker
and
the
sentence
he
had
been
given
was
a
total
of
how
many
years?
unknown
speaker
in
arkansas,
does
a
plea
agreement
have
to
be
entered
into
in
writing
ultimately
before
it
is
put
into
effect?
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
have
to
be
approved
by
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
where
was
that
in
santobello
that
there
was
reliance
on--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
that
the
defendant
in
santobello
had
relied
on
the
plea
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
in
the...
the
opinion
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
the
opinion
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
does?
unknown
speaker
it
says
that
he
relied
on
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
that
prejudiced
him?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
the
bargaining
between
the
man
and
the
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
santobello
is
about,
and
that
is
what
this
case
is
about,
and
i'm
not
too
sure
santobello
helps
you
that
much.
unknown
speaker
general
clark,
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
concluded
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
issue
unless
the
state
resentenced
the
defendant
in
accordance
with
the
concurrent
sentence
plea
proposal.
do
you
know
why
the
court
of
appeals
made
nothing
of
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
in
arkansas
had
never
approved
the
plea
bargain?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
the
court
of
appeals,
instead
of
saying
what
it
did,
it
said,
until
the
state
submits
the
plea
bargain
to
the
judge
who
tried
the
case,
saying
the
prosecutor
is
bound
but
not
the
trial
judge.
would
you
still...
under
your
theory
it
is
still
objectionable,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
general
clark,
just
so
i
understand
your
position,
in
this
particular
case
you
say
it
would
have
been
silly
to
make
this
offer,
because
it
really
was
no
punishment
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
make
the
same
constitutional
argument
if
they
had
offered
him
15
years
instead
of
life
or
something
like
15
years
consecutive
and
then
later
changed
their
mind
and
decided
it
ought
to
be
21
years
consecutive.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
of
arkansas
law,
at
what
point
could
the
defendant
have
withdrawn
his
participation
and
said,
i
have
changed
my
mind,
i
want
to
go
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
any
time
up
to
when?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if
your
emphasis
on
detrimental
reliance
and
prejudice
means
that
it
is
sort
of
an
estoppel
theory?
the
prosecutor
becomes
estopped
if
the
other
party
relies?
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
to
be
a
right
at
stake,
i
guess.
there
has
to
be
a
right
at
stake.
his
right
to
a
trial
is
at
stake.
unknown
speaker
see,
detrimental
reliance
is
not
normally
an
element
of
waiver.
that
is
merely
intelligence
and
understanding
the
choices,
and
when
you
bring
in
the
reliance,
it
strikes
me
that
your
analogy
is
really
sort
of
an
estoppel
analogy.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
doubt
that
this
man
did
rely
on
it?
unknown
speaker
that
he
didn't
rely
on
that
agreement?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
do
to
show
he
didn't
rely
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
he
didn't
do
anything,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
he
had
not
gotten
the
deal,
would
he
have
done
something?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
gone
out
to
get
some
witnesses,
too.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
assume
that
when
a
man
gets
an
agreement
with
the
state,
he
relies
on
it,
then
he
has
to
show
in
addition
that
he
was
injured
by
it.
that
is
my
problem.
unknown
speaker
what
prejudice?
unknown
speaker
some
right?
the
right
is
to
rely
on
the
state.
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
made
by
a
state
official
authorized
to
make--
--we
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
and
frankly
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
prosecutors
ought
to
keep
their
word
and
abide
by
their
bargains,
but
the
point
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
has
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
hold
the
prosecutor
to
what
in
effect
is
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
and
that
depends--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
depends,
as
i
understand
your
theory,
on
his
showing
that
he
is
worse
off
than
if
the
representation
had
never
been
made.
detrimental
reliance.
and
you
say
he--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
minimum
showing
is
some
detriment.
he
has
been...
he
is
worse
off
than
if
there
had
never
been
this
tentative
agreement.
that
is
your
whole...
what
i
understand
to
be
your
position.
unknown
speaker
the
same
essential
ingredient
is
in
any
estoppel
case.
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
defendant
could
have
withdrawn
his
plea
at
any
time
or
his
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
at
any
time
until
the
judge
had
accepted
it
and
acted
on
it?
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
there
is
any
reliance
on
the
contract
theory,
then
the
contract
theory
would
be
that
both
are
bound
or
neither
is
bound.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ganzfried,
i
take
it
it
would
make
no
differences
for
purposes
of
your
argument
if
the
agreement
had
been
reduced
to
writing
by
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
these
written
agreements,
at
least
in
some
jurisdictions,
purport
to
give
up
those
rights
on
the
signing
of
the
agreement,
although
it
still
is
subject
sometimes
to
approval
by
the
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
your
friend
that
the
defendant
may
withdraw
at
any
time
up
to
the
time
the
court
acts
on
the
plea
and
possibly
even
afterwards?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
twice
as
much
in
terms
of
adding
the
numbers--
unknown
speaker
--without
reference
to
whether
they
are
consecutive
or
concurrent?
unknown
speaker
you
agree,
then,
that
the
trial
judge
was
the
final
arbiter?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
eighth
circuit
leave
your
client
in
a
better
position
by
its
order
than
he
would
have
been
if
the
plea
agreement
had
been
accepted
and
the
prosecutor
had
been
forced
to
abide
by
the
agreement?
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says
that
not
only
must
the
prosecutor
be
deemed
to
have
accepted
the
agreement,
but
the
trial
judge.
how
can
you
justify
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
is
applying
constitutional
principles.
it
has
no
business
tinkering
at
all
with
arkansas
procedure
unless
there
is
some
constitutional
violation,
and
i
understood
its
theory
and
i
thought
your
theory
was
that
the
bargain,
the
plea
agreement
is
specifically
enforceable,
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
more
than
specifically
enforce
the...
it
bound
the
trial
judge
to
the
plea
agreement
in
a
way
that
he
would
never
have
been
bound
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
you
could
justify
that
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
theory
of
your
case,
does
it?
i
mean,
it
is
just
kind
of
throwing
yourself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
wrote
it
but
they
didn't
think
it?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily
one
finds
the
rationale
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
mr.
quiggle,
under
arkansas
practice,
if
the
agreement
had
been...
there
had
been
no
misunderstanding
and
no
change,
and
had
been
submitted
to
the
court,
would
there
have
been
a
recommendation
by
the
prosecutor
that
that
be
entered?
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
told
to
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
it
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
those
circumstances,
in
terms
of
the
impact,
isn't
the
standard
that
you
cannot
assist
him
if
you
know
he
is
testifying
falsely?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
any
different
before
or
after?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
be
the
first
time
that
the
defense
counsel
became
aware
of
the
reality?
