mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
incorrectly
magnified
the
respondent's
unilateral
expectations
into
a
constitutional...
a
protected
constitutional
right.
since
the
federal
courts,
of
course,
have
no
general
supervisory
power
over
the
state
courts
in
criminal
cases,
the
role
of
this
court
in
a
habeas
proceeding
is
limited
to
correcting
constitutional
violations,
and
it
is
our
submission
that
such
questions
arise
only
when
the
defendant's
reliance
on
a
plea
agreement
substantially
induces
his
waiver
of
a
right
protected
by
the
constitution.
ordinarily
such
an
issue
will
not
arise
until
a
defendant
pleads
guilty,
but
if
the
prosecutor
breaches
his
bargain
after
that,
santobello
teaches
that
a
remedy
may
be
appropriate,
that
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
relief,
and
the
reason
is
that
where
the
bargain
is
a
material
inducement
to
the
plea,
the
knowing
and
voluntary
nature
of
the
plea
is
called
into
question.
now,
admittedly,
there
may
be
some
cases
where
similar
concerns
would
arise
prior
to
the
plea,
where
the
defendant
has
detrimentally
relied
on
the
bargain,
for
example,
by
cooperating
with
ongoing
investigation,
but
the
same
principle
applies
here,
too.
the
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
some
kind
of
relief
only
because
his
reliance
on
the
agreement
undermines
the
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
of
a
protected
constitutional
right,
and
that
is
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
any
time.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
i
understand
it,
certainly
any
time
up
through
the
entry
of
his
plea
of
guilty,
and
in
fact
i
think
under
the
current
rules
in
arkansas
he
could
move
to
withdraw
his
plea
after
the
plea
had
been
tendered
but
before
sentence
had
been
passed
by
the
court.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
it
could
be
put
in
those
terms.
of
course,
in
the
contract
law
analogy
and
promissory
estoppel,
the
reliance
by
the
other
side,
of
course,
has
to
be
reasonable
and
justified,
and
in
the
context--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--frankly,
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
vocabulary,
to
move
aside
from
the
contract
law,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
have
a
question
about
the
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
of
a
right.
that
is,
have
you
waived
something,
and
did
you
do
that
substantially
induced
by
an
agreement?
in
that
event,
you
may
have
detrimental
reliance,
and
you
may
be
entitled
to
pursue
a
claim.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
we
keep
changing
tracks
in
terms
of
the
legal
vocabulary
used
here
between
the
constitutional
law
analysis
and
the
contract
law
analysis.
i
think
the
analogies
are
apt
in
this
case,
and
generally
when
i
use
the
term
"detrimental
reliance"
it
will
be
to
refer
to
the
waiver
of
a
right
induced
by
an
agreement,
and
that
raises
questions
as
to
the
voluntary
and
knowing
nature
of
that
waiver.
now,
those
concerns--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--there
is...
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
this
man
did
not
rely
on
that?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
did
not
rely
on
the
agreement.
the
district
court
expressly
found,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
he
did
absolutely
nothing
in
reliance
with
this--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
did
nothing
to
show
that
he
did
rely
on
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
did
nothing.
he
told
his
lawyer,
this
sounds
like
a
good
deal,
let's
take
it,
and
his
lawyer
got
back
to
him
and
said,
it
has
been
withdrawn.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
he
had
not
gotten
the
deal?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
might
have
pleaded
guilty
to...
he
might
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
might
have
done
any
number
of
things,
but
he
did
nothing.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
would
have
to
show
some
prejudice,
but
first
he
has
to
show--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--some...
that
there
was
some
right
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
that
he
has
lost
because
of
the
agreement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
not
when
you
have
an
agreement
that
is
not
finalized
until
a
court
accepts
it.
there
was
no
justifiable
reliance.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant,
of
course,
can
back
out
at
any
time.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
we
don't
have
that
here.
there
might
be
a
case
where
you
have
some
sort
of
detrimental
reliance.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
right.
now,
ordinarily,
even
if
he
makes
that
showing--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--ordinarily,
there
is
not
going
to
be
that
showing
unless
he
has
a
plea,
unless
he
has
cooperated
with
the
authorities.
here
we
have
none
of
those,
and
none
of
those
concerns.
what
we
have
is
a
rule,
a
prophylactic
rule
laid
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
keyed
to
the
unilateral
expectations
of
the
respondent.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
rare
criminal
defendant
who
doesn't
hope
for
the
best,
whether
it
be
a
lenient
plea
agreement,
an
acquittal
at
trial,
or
a
light
sentence.
the
point
is
that
he
has
no
right
to
impose
those
transitory
hopes,
to
make
those
transitory
hopes
binding
on
the
state
and
the
courts.
this
court
has
held
that
a
defendant
has
no
right
to
plea
bargain.
he
has
no
right
to
have
a
guilty
plea
accepted,
and
he
has
no
right
to
know
in
advance
what
his
sentence
will
be,
a
particularly
important
issue
here,
because
until
that
plea
is
presented
to
the
court
and
the
bargain
is
presented
to
the
court
and
it
is
accepted
and
sentence
is
passed--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that's
correct,
and
there
may
even
be
provision...
i
would
have
to
check
this...
under
arkansas
law
similar
to
under
federal
law
that
would
allow
him
to
move
to
vacate
the
plea
thereafter,
but
that
is
correct.
there
was
nothing
binding
on
the
respondent.
he
had...
even
if
he
thought
he
still
had
an
agreement
after
it
was
clearly
communicated
that
it
had
been
withdrawn,
he
could
have
walked
away
from
it
at
any
time,
certainly
at
any
time
relevant
to
these
proceedings.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
there
is
no
meeting
of
the
minds,
that
there
has
been
no
performance,
not
even
partial
performance,
and
in
fact
there
is
no
mutuality
of
obligation,
because
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
to
impose
an
obligation
only
on
the
government,
the
prosecution,
to
abide
by
even
what
in
this
case
is
really
a
ludicrous
slip
of
the
tongue
to
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
sentence
that
would
give
him
no
additional
jail
time
for
a
murder
that
he
had
been
previously
convicted
of.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that
is
correct.
there
would
be
no
justifiable
reliance
until
he
waived
a
right,
and
then
that
was
done
because
he
was
induced
by
the
agreement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
certainly
in
the
federal
courts,
and
in
arkansas
as
well,
it
is
up
to
the
court
ultimately
to
decide
whether
that
plea
is
acceptable
and
that
bargain
is
acceptable.
now,
under
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals,
what
prosecutors
are
going
to
have
to
do
to
protect
themselves
is
that
they
are
going
to
have
to
possibly
conduct
all
negotiations
on
the
record,
and
as
a
result,
they
would
remove
much
of
the
flexibility
that
now
benefits
defendants
as
well
as
the
state.
another
possibility
is
that
plea
proposals
may
be
couched
with
so
many
contingencies
that
they
are
virtually
meaningless.
another
possibility
is
that
negotiations
will
be
delayed
until
so
late
in
the
process
that
the
benefits
of
prompt
disposition
would
be
lost
to
prosecutors
and
defendants,
because,
after
all,
in
arkansas
and
presumably
in
the
eighth
circuit,
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
be
concerned
that
a
slip
of
the
tongue
may
bind
him
to
something
that
he
never
intended
to
say,
and
that
the
other
side
never
took
him...
and
relied
on.
thank
you.
