mr.
richard
quiggle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
warrant
the
broad
ruling
that
the
state
seeks,
that
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
eighth
circuit's
holding
is
broader
than
the
eighth
circuit
perceived
it
to
be,
and
therefore
this
court
decides
to
enter
a
very
broad
ruling,
it
should
certainly
not
be
that
the
state
is
allowed
to
play
fast
and
loose
with
the
bargaining
process
until
it
decides
it
has
gotten
the
kind
of
penalty
it
wants.
mr.
richard
quiggle
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
strict
contract
principles
in
this
matter
just
do
not
apply.
i
think
the
government
is
held
to
a
higher
standard
than
the
defendant
might
be,
but
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
either,
your
honor.
the
fact
is,
and
i
disagree
sharply
with
the
state
when
they
argue
that
my
client
did
not
plead
guilty.
my
client
in
fact
pled
guilty
to
twice
as
much
as
the
original
agreement
called
for,
and
i
think
it
is
absurd
to
think
that
he
would
not
have
pled
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
do
so
to
21
years
if
he
would
plead
guilty
to
42.
mr.
richard
quiggle
yes.
mr.
richard
quiggle
that
is...
well,
in
fact,
the
bargain,
your
honor,
that
was
finally
struck
was
that
it
would
be
21
years
consecutive
as
opposed
to
21
years
concurrent.
i
also
disagree
when
the
state
suggests
that
that
would
have
resulted
in
no
additional
penalty
to
my
client.
he
had
already
served
under
the
original
murder
conviction
two
and
a
half
years
of
the
original
sentence.
plus,
even
if
he
got
a
consecutive
sentence...
i
mean,
a
concurrent
sentence,
it
would
not
have
started
to
run
until
it
was
actually
entered
by
the
court.
thus,
effectively
speaking,
there
would
have
been
some
additional
penalty.
obviously,
we
can
only
go
back
and
second
guess
as
to
whether
that
would
have
been
adequate
or
been
accepted
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
richard
quiggle
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
quiggle
i
think
effectively
speaking
you
are
right,
your
honor.
the
court
cut
through
the
judicial
intervention
that
would
have
occurred
had
this
case
come
up
in
the
normal
course
of
things.
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
acting
in
a
very
practical
fashion.
after
all,
my
client
had
already
served
the
enhanced
sentence.
mr.
richard
quiggle
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
quiggle
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
can,
because
this
case,
even
the
habeas
case
has
been
pending
a
long
time,
and
these
facts
are
very
stale,
and
my
client
has
already
served
the
enhanced
agreement.
it
would
simply
not
be
fair
to
my
client
to
place
him
in
the
jeopardy
of
the
trial
court
now
perhaps
rejecting
that
plea
bargain.
mr.
richard
quiggle
well,
i
guess
it
is,
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
but
of
course
i
will
say
that
this
issue
was
not
brought
up
to
the
eighth
circuit,
and
therefore
their
opinion
does
not
address
it
at
all,
and
i
am
somewhat
at
a
disadvantage
to
justify
their
thinking
when
i
don't
know
that
they
ever
thought
it.
i
believe
that--
mr.
richard
quiggle
--well,
they
did
not
address
the
issue
of
whether
they
can
order
specific
performance
and
bypass
what
the
trial
judge
might
have
done
back
in
1973,
or
actually
'72,
i'm
sorry.
and
therefore
i
don't
know
what
the
rationale
that
they
might...
that
the
eighth
circuit
might
have
applied
to
it
would
be.
i
think
it
is,
as
i
have
expressed
to
you,
that
they
found
a
constitutional
violation,
and
they
attempted
to
shape
a
remedy
that
seemed
appropriate
under
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
quiggle
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
addressed
by
the
parties
or
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
richard
quiggle
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
even
unto
this
day
trial
courts
in
arkansas
routinely,
if
not...
and
consistently
take
those
recommendations.
it
is
rare
that
a
court
rejects
one
in
arkansas,
and
that
was
certainly
true
back
when
the
plea
would
have
been
entered
in
this
case
had
the
government
not
reneged
on
its
word.
unfortunately,
the
trial
judge
who
would
have
heard
this
matter
has
been
dead
a
number
of
years,
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
back
to
him,
and
the
practice
has
shifted
some.
we
have
new
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
so
forth.
but
practically
speaking,
had
this
gone
before
the
trial
judge,
every
expectation
would
have
been
that
it
would
have
been
approved
if
a
prosecutor
recommended
it,
and
that
is,
of
course,
a
central
point
to
what
my
position
is.
i
am
certainly
not
suggesting
in
the
routine
course
of
things
that
trial
judges
would
be
bound
by
what
the
prosecutor
agrees
to
recommend.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
simply
that
the
prosecutor
has
to
stick
by
his
word.
the
trial
court
can
always
reject
it.
and
i
don't
perceive
the
eighth
circuit...
that's
why
i
continue
to
make
the
point
that
i
don't
think
this
is
a
proper
case
for
any
kind
of
broad
ruling,
because
it
has
got
some
screwy
facts
in
it,
and
there
is
also
the
aspect
of
this
case
that
i
think
makes
it
difficult...
my
position
difficult
here
is
that
there
is
ineffectiveness
proven
in
the
record,
and
there
is
ineffectiveness
claimed
as
to
the
trial
counsel
for
not
going
forward
to
enforce
the
plea.
he
states
in
the
hearing
that
there
was
simply
nothing
he
could
do.
now,
i
presume
that
a
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
knows
the
law,
and
santobello
had
been
decided
several
months
at
that
point,
but
those
issues
were
not
reached
by
the
eighth
circuit,
so
i
don't
mean
to
rely
on
or
press
it
on
this
court
heavily
at
this
time,
but
the
fact
is,
there
is
a
lot
of
uncertainty
built
into
this
opinion,
i
believe,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
it's
the
kind
of
a
case
upon
which
a
broad
ruling
should
depend.
if
there
is
one,
i
just
think
it
is
that
the
prosecutor
cannot
make
his
word
in
a
final
sense,
as
here,
where
there
was
an
offer
that
was
clear
on
its
face,
and
i
disagree
with
the
state
when
they
say
that
it
is
really
simple,
it
is
really
logical
to
figure
out
what
happened
here.
if
that
is
true,
why
didn't
they
put
on
any
proof
about
that?
they
offered
no
witnesses
at
all
in
this
case.
none.
the
fact
is,
if
one
wants
to
speculate,
which
is
all
the
state
can
do,
about
the
prosecutor's
motivations,
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
equally
logical
and
perhaps
a
lot
more
believable
that
this
prosecutor
meant
exactly
what
he
said
when
he
offered
21
years
concurrent,
and
the
supervisor
found
out
about
it
and
overruled
him,
because
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
are
clearly
seen
from
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
were
shocking,
where
a
father
kills
his
own
daughter.
there
was
lots
of
press.
the
court
will
recall
there
was
a
mistrial
because
of
the
press.
after
the
plea
was
rejected
there
were
collateral
civil
lawsuits
filed
in
this
matter,
and
i
think
the
prosecutor
was
taking
a
lot
of
heat,
and
consequently
he
said
no,
we
can't...
we
are
going
to
have
to
get
more
time
out
of
this
guy,
the
deputy
prosecutor's
superior.
and
i
think
under
the
facts--
mr.
richard
quiggle
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
was
for
some
months,
until
after
the
plea
was
rejected,
because
it
was
set
down
for
a
hearing
that
was
continued,
and
then
they
came
back
and
had
the
mistrial
that
i
mentioned
just
a
second
ago,
and
i
believe
that
it
was
not
until
they
commenced
that
trial
that
my
client,
mr.
johnson,
knew
that
the
original
offer
had
been
rejected.
mr.
richard
quiggle
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record,
your
honor,
but
i
will
say
that
the
prosecutor,
the
deputy
prosecutor
who
was
assigned
to
the
case
after
the
plea
was
withdrawn
by
the
state
admitted
that
he
did
not
contact
mr.
johnson
until
shortly
before
the
time
of
the
hearing
where
the
mistrial
occurred,
and
so
i
think
presumably
that
encompasses
the
fact
that
he
did
not
communicate
the
withdrawn
plea.
the
facts
are
very
specific
about
how
the
original
offer
was
made,
and
i
think
that
they
would
have
been
equally
specific
had
this
been
communicated.
i
think
if
the
court
does
consider
this
matter
in
the
broad
sense
that
the
state
seeks,
that
it
must
give
due
consideration
to
the
state's
argument
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
in
situations
like
this,
because
i
think
clearly
it
does
apply.
i
think
that,
for
example,
as
a
trial
counsel
in
a
criminal
matter,
if
my
client
has
admitted
that
he
is
guilty,
and
is
ready
to
plead,
i
believe
that
that
is
going
to
have
a
profound
impact
upon
that
defendant
if
he
then
is
forced
to
go
to
trial.
it
is
certainly
going
to
have
a
profound
impact
on
me
or
any
other
criminal
attorney
if
i
have
to
put
that
man
on
the
stand.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
do
so.
i
think
it
places
counsel
in
a
very
awkward
ethical
position,
because
probably
he
is
going
to
have
to
take
the
stand
and
lie.
therefore,
i
think
that
the
court
must
be
very
cautious
in
waving
aside
the
state's
argument
that...
or
my
contention
that
the
sixth
amendment
is
very
important
in
this
case.
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
cooper
case
certainly
thought
it
was
also.
mr.
richard
quiggle
i
certainly
think
in
the
instance
where
a
defendant,
as
here,
would
have
to
take
the
stand
in
order
to
make
their
case,
i
believe
that
it
does--
mr.
richard
quiggle
--well,
your
honor,
i
presume
that
before
the
defendant
has
not
conceded
his
guilt
to
anyone,
and
in
the
face
of
these
kinds
of
facts,
in
fact,
the
defendant
has
said,
yes,
i
am
guilty.
mr.
richard
quiggle
it
certainly
would
probably
be
the
first
time
under
normal
practice,
i
would
think,
your
honor,
that
a
defense
counsel
was
told
by
the
defendant
literally,
i
am
guilty.
i
would
just
like
to
say
one
more
thing,
and
that
is
that
i
don't
see
the
eighth
circuit
establishing
a
prophylactic
rule
here.
i
think
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
was
tailored
only
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
and
it
was
very
narrowly
drawn,
and
therefore
i
don't
believe
that
it
impinges
upon
the
criminal
process
in
the
way
that
the
state
perceives,
but
if
it
does,
it
should
impinge
such
that
the
prosecution
must
deal
honestly
and
fairly
and
abide
by
its
word.
thank
you.
