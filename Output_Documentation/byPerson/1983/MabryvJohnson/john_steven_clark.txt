mr.
john
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
state
appears
here
as
a
petitioner
because
of
the
importance
it
attaches
to
the
resolution
of
this
case
on
its
merits
due
to
the
split
in
the
circuits
and
that
impact
on
the
criminal
justice
system.
that
issue,
as
we
define
it,
is,
is
the
defendant
constitutionally
entitled
to
specific
performance
of
a
plea
offer
once
made,
then
withdrawn,
prior
to
entry
of
a
guilty
plea
or
a
showing
of
detrimental
reliance
or
prejudice.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
argue
that
a
better
rule
of
law
and
a
better
policy
is
that
specific
performance
is
only
constitutionally
entitled
when
that
defendant
has
made
a
showing
of
detrimental
reliance
or
prejudice,
and
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
and
that
a
rigid
rule,
the
rigid
rule
enunciated
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
below,
has
the
effect
of
stripping
the
prosecutor
of
any
discretion,
the
trial
court
of
any
discretion,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
creating
a
constitutional
right
and
a
unilateral
expectation
of
the
defendant.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
trial
court,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
trial
court,
your
honor,
would
consider
the
plea
offer
that
was
made,
and
would
decide
whether
it
was
acceptable
and
either
accept
it
or
not.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
sir,
the
trial
court
may
reject
the
offer.
the
facts
below
briefly
are
these.
fourteen
years
ago,
in
1970,
the
defendant
was
charged
with
murder
in
the
first
degree,
burglary,
and
assault
with
intent
to
kill.
he
was
convicted
on
the
charge
of
murder
and
received
life
imprisonment.
he
was
convicted
on
the
charge
of
burglary
and
assault
with
intent
to
kill
and
received
a
sentence
of
21
years
and
12
years
respectively,
which
were
to
be
served
concurrently.
in
1972,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
reversed
the
murder
conviction
for
inadequate
jury
instruction,
and
defendant
was
appointed
a
counsel.
he
was
arraigned,
and
a
trial
date
was
set.
late
friday
afternoon,
october
27th,
1972,
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
communicated
to
the
defense
counsel
a
plea
offer,
that
offer
being,
if
the
defendant
would
plead
guilty
to
21
years
concurrent
to
the
charge
of
accessory
after
felony
murder,
a
plea
could
be
stricken,
a
recommended
plea
could
be
agreed
to.
defense
counsel
took
that
offer
to
the
defendant
at
the
penitentiary
the
next
day,
and
he
agreed.
the
very
next
working
day,
monday,
october
30th,
defense
counsel
communicated
to
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
his
agreement,
and
was
informed
there
was
a
mistake,
that
the
plea
recommendation
would
have
to
be
for
a
sentence
of
21
years
consecutive
rather
than
concurrent.
defense
counsel
or
defendant
had
no
further
comment
to
either
the
prosecutor
or
to
the
court
until
november
the
8th
of
that
year,
when
the
defendant
appeared
before
the
court
for
trial
on
the
charge
of
murder
with
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
that
trial
ended
in
mistrial.
a
subsequent
date
was
set.
it
was
continued,
and
the
in
february
of
1973,
the
defendant,
in
the
presence
of
a
jury,
withdrew
his
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
entered
voluntarily
a
plea
of...
excuse
me,
withdrew
his
plea
of
not
guilty
to
murder
in
the
first
degree,
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge
of
accessory
after
felony
murder,
and
was
sentenced
to
21
years
consecutively.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
the
defendant
is
on
parole
now.
mr.
john
steven
clark
defendant
was
sentenced
in
1970
and
'71,
and
was
released
in
1977,
i
believe...
'79,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
for
the
charge
of
burglary
and
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
21
years
for
burglary
and
12
for
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
and
that
was
the
sentence
he
was
served.
he
is
still
under
the
subject
and
control
of
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
and
his
parole
eligibility
date
for
absolute
release
would
be
march
17,
1988,
or
march
17,
2009,
depending
on
the
sentence.
mr.
john
steven
clark
there
is
not
a
requirement
in
the
state
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
trial
court
must
approve
any
plea
that
has
been
offered
to
a
defendant.
this
court
has
recognized
that
plea
bargaining
is
an
inherent
part
of
that
criminal
justice
process,
and
inherent
in
any
plea
bargaining
agreement
is
the
requirement
of
fundamental
fairness.
in
santobello
this
court
enunciated
that
a
defendant
was
only
entitled
to
specific
performance
where
there
had
been
that
showing
of
detrimental
reliance
or
prejudice.
in
the
case
at
bar,
there
has
been
no
showing
of
reliance
or
prejudice,
and
fundamental
fairness
requires
that
the
benefit
inure
equally
to
the
state
as
it
does
to
the
defendant.
mr.
john
steven
clark
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
the
defendant
relied
by
entering
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
facts,
the
defendant
did
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
john
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
steven
clark
it
does
say
that.
yes,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
mr.
john
steven
clark
he
relied
by
virtue
of
entering
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
john
steven
clark
that
shows
that
reliance.
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
instance,
in
the
case
at
bar,
mr.
johnson
did
not
enter
any
plea
of
guilty.
in
fact,
the
plea
bargaining
was
revoked
on
monday,
when
there
had
been
a
mistake
indicated.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
santobello
does
help
in
the
sense
that
unless
the
defendant
shows
there
has
been
some
detrimental
reliance
or
some
prejudice.
in
this
instance
the
facts
do
not
show
that.
in
this
instance,
the
defendant
was
offered
a
bargain.
there
was
a
mistake,
an
honest
mistake.
as
soon
as
that
offer
was
accepted
and
communicated
back
to
the
prosecutor,
to
be
known
that
there
was
a
mistake,
the
prosecutor
gave
evidence
that
there
was
a
mistake.
at
that
point,
the
defendant
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
went
to
trial
on
the
plea
of
not
guilty.
the
defendant
did
not
raise
at
any
time
to
the
court
or
to
the
prosecutor
that
there
had
been
any
bad
faith,
there
had
been
any
indication
by
the
prosecutor
of
vindictiveness,
just
indicated
that
there
was
a
mistake.
in
fact,
i
think
the
mistake
is
fairly
self-evident
if
you
logically
conclude
what
occurred.
here
was
the
defendant
serving
21
years
for
burglary
and
12
years
for
assault
with
intent
to
kill,
doing
time.
he
had
been
tried
once
for
murder
in
the
first
degree,
convicted,
and
sentenced
to
life.
now,
here
was
the
state
coming
forward
with
a
plea
bargain
which
said
you
could
serve
21
years
concurrent.
it
would
have
been
as
if
the
deputy
prosecutor
had
said,
would
you
accept
a
plea
bargain
in
which
we
will
drop
all
charges
against
your
defendant.
and
so
i
think
it
is
obvious
from
the
logical
conclusion
that
there
was
a
mistake
here,
and
that
in
this
instance
the
defendant
was
not
prejudiced
by
that
mistake,
because
he
did
have
an
adequate
remedy,
which
was
trial
by
jury.
mr.
john
steven
clark
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
why
they
did
not.
that
is
the
issue
that
brings
the
state
to
this
petition,
for
the
reason
that
that
erodes
all
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
it
is
such
a
rigid,
inflexible
rule
that
there
is
no
benefit,
no
mutuality
of
advantage
that
goes
and
flows
to
the
state
from
plea
bargaining
for
the
very
reason
that
you
are
bound
only
to
the
unilateral
expectation
of
the
defendant,
and
that
there
is
some
mutuality
of
advantage
that
is
a
part
of
the
plea
bargaining
process
that
inures
to
the
state.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
still
objectionable.
that
obviously
is
a
better
remedy
than
what
we
have
now,
but
it
is
still
objectionable,
because
of
the
split
in
the
circuits
and
the
fact
that
predicated
on
this
unilateral
expectation
of
the
defendant,
and
i
think
we
find
a
situation
where
two
disastrous
results
occur,
the
first
of
which
is
that
we
have
given
rise
to
a
constitutional
right
to
a
defendant
who
has
been
engaged
in
the
plea
negotiation
process,
which
this
court
has
enunciated
that
plea
bargaining
is
not
a
constitutional
right.
so,
for
those
defendants
that
are
not
involved
in
the
plea
negotiation
process,
they
don't
have
the
same
issue
to
bring
to
an
appellate...
for
an
appellate
remedy
of
post-conviction
remedy.
secondly,
the
effect
of
depending
solely
on
the
unilateral
expectations
of
defendant
can
create
a
situation
where
literally
each
case
on
its
merits
will
have
to
be
reviewed
through
the
post-conviction
remedy
and
appellate
process
without
being
able
to
set
a
standard
by
which
they
can
be
judged
against,
because
each
defendant
will
have
some
expectation,
i
didn't
believe
that
i
was
going
to
be
sentenced
to
21
years
consecutive,
and
you
get
into
this
court
having
to
ask
of
events
of
five,
ten,
and
fifteen
years
ago,
what
did
one
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
say
to
one
deputy
public
defender?
what
was
the
context
of
the
five
to
seven
minute
conversation?
what
in
fact
happens
if
the
defense
counsel
makes
a
mistake?
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
below
was
a
very
important
decision
in
that
it
erodes
the
flexibility
of
fundamental
fairness
as
it
applies
to
the
criminal
justice
system,
and
as
i
have
said
there
would
be
no
benefit
that
would
have
flown
to
the
state
if
you
follow
the
strict
adherence
of
the
court
below,
because
johnson
would
not
be
serving
any
time
for
the
crime
of
murder.
and
although
the
court
below
says
it
does
not
rely
on
principles
of
contract,
it
does
seem
to
adhere
to
some
contracting
theory
in
the
sense
that
there
is
an
offer
and
there
was
an
acceptance,
and
therefore
the
state
should
be
bound.
i
submit
to
you
that
what
we
are
discussing
here
are
not
issues
of
contract,
and
though
the
analogy
may
be
important
from
the
standpoint
of
being
somewhat
instructive,
we
are
dealing
with
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
steven
clark
yes,
sir,
i
would
make
the
same
argument
if
you
withdraw
the
plea
if
no
prejudice
had
attached,
there
had
been
no
detrimental
reliance.
i
would
also
to
this
court
that
as
i
said,
that
the
result
of
this
decision
in
terms
of
contract
is
one
which
this...
we
are
talking
about
constitutional
rights
and
the
deprivation
of
liberty,
and
that
if
you
were
just
going
to
analogize
simply
to
contract,
where
one
party
negotiates
with
another,
you
realize
that
both
parties
have
the
power
to
enforce
that
agreement,
and
in
this
instance
the
criminal
defendant
has
the
right
to
withdraw
that
plea,
even
though
there
has
been
a
bargain
struck.
the
offense
to
the
dignity
of
the
state
in
terms
of
prosecution
and
the
very
narrow
rigid
rule
applied
by
the
eighth
circuit
is
this.
take
this
situation.
had
the
prosecutor
offered
20
years,
25
years,
to
be
specific,
and
the
defender
had
heard
only
five
and
communicated
that
five-year
offer
to
his
defendant,
he
would
have
said,
i
accept,
would
have
communicated
back
to
the
prosecuting
attorney,
we
accept
the
plea
of
five
years,
but
in
fact
it
should
have
been
communicated
to
the
one
who
originally
made
the
offer,
who
was
out
sick,
to
a
second
one,
and
they
agreed.
and
then
the
prosecution
went
forward
to
take
a
statement
from
the
defendant
showing
some
reliance
on
his
part
in
which
he
perhaps
implicated
other
accessories
to
this
crime.
then
in
fact
only
at
the
time
that
we
appeared
before
the
bar
of
justice
of
the
court
at
the
trial
court
level
would
we
find
the
situation
where
the
defendant
could
have
raised
the
issue
of
he
had
unilaterally
expected
a
five-year
sentence
instead
of
a
25-year
sentence,
and
his
expectation
was
predicated
on
the
argument
of
his
defense
counsel,
the
mistake
there,
and
that
if
you
follow
the
rule
of
the
eighth
circuit
below
and
its
rigid
application,
you
could
contend
that
that
bargain
must
be
struck,
and
in
fact
that
defendant
is
entitled
to
that
when
the
mistake
was
not
made
by
the
government
whatsoever.
the
argument
also
has
been
made
that
the
government
must
act
scrupulously.
if
you
can't
trust
the
government,
who
can
you
trust?
well,
in
fact,
the
better
policy,
of
course,
is
that
in
any
plea
bargaining
situation
between
the
prosecution
and
the
defense,
every
offer
and
agreement
should
be
made,
but
the
fact
also
is
that
we
do
not
deal
with
technical
precision.
people
do
make
mistakes.
and
the
trust
of
the
defendant
is
not
based
really
in
the
prosecutor,
because
the
prosecutor
is
the
defendant's
advocate.
the
trust
of
the
defendant
is
predicated
in
his
belief
in
the
court.
and
so
therefore
the
decision
below
does
not
fashion
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
sense
of
mutuality
of
advantage
that
it
could
gain
through
the
plea
bargaining
process,
because
the
court
needs
the
discretion
to
review
these
plea
bargaining
negotiations
and
then
order,
one,
specific
performance
or,
two,
recision,
which
gives
that
defendant
an
adequate
remedy,
which
is
trial
by
jury.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
important
from
the
perspective
of
the
state
to
indicate
that
unless
we
have
a
standard
enunciated
by
this
court,
a
standard
which
indicates
that
without
some
showing
of
bad
faith,
without
some
showing
of
detrimental
reliance,
that
we
have
an
unworkable
triple
justice
system
in
which
the
state
must
function,
because
virtually
in
the
calendar
year
1983
just
in
the
united
states
district
courts
alone
there
were
some
35,000
defendants
who
plead
guilty
or
nolo
to
criminal
charges.
of
that
number,
some
29,000...
excuse
me,
were
charged
with
criminal
offenses.
of
that
number,
some
29,000
either
pled
guilty
or
in
fact
pled
nolo.
so
you
have
30,000
out
of
35,000
coming
into
the
system
by
virtue
of
plea
bargaining
and
the
negotiation
process,
and
a
mutuality
of
advantage
must
flow
to
the
state.
it
must
flow
to
the
state
or
the
state
finds
itself
continually
in
litigation
as
to
the
expectation
of
the
defendant.
the
remedy
that
the
state
would
beseech
this
court
and
urge
this
court
to
give
is
that
standard,
the
showing
of
bad
faith,
the
showing
of
some
detrimental
reliance,
and
that
that
is
not
just
mistake,
because
mistake
is
not
enough
in
that
if
you
follow
just
mistake
there
is
no
punishment,
for
instance,
in
this
case
at
bar,
that
would
flow
to
the
defendant,
and
no
respect
for
the
dignity
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
arkansas
for
an
offense
committed
against
its
dignity
and
its
citizenry.
i
would
conclude,
your
honor,
by
simply
saying
this.
fundamental
fairness
and
mutuality
of
advantage
of
plea
bargaining
require
that
a
punishment
must
fit
the
crime,
that
the
state
must
have
the
ability
to
deal
equally
and
dispose
of
cases
quickly,
and
deal
equally
with
the
defendant
in
the
plea
bargaining
process,
and
that
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
citizenry
of
our
state,
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
any
specific
performance
of
a
plea
