mr.
mark
s.
wernick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
courts:
when
murphy
went
into
that
probation
office
he
was
faced
with
the
classic
cruel
trilemma.
he
was
faced
with
the
options
of
self-incrimination
or
contempt
for
refusing
to
talk
or
perjury
if
he
talked
falsely.
his
only
way
out--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--he
was
under
a
court
order
to
respond
truthfully
to
his
probation
officer
in
all
matters.
if
he
refused
to
do
that
that
would
be
in
contempt.
what
i
was
about
to
say,
justice
rehnquist,
that
his
only
way
out
of
that
trilemma
would
be
to
assert
the
privilege.
on
the
question
that
the
court
has
asked
whether
his
probation
could
be
revoked
for
merely
asserting
the
privilege
it
is
my
position
that
a
probationer
has
full
fifth
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
a
new
criminal
prosecution
but
perhaps
some
lesser
fifth
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
a
probation
revocation
hearing.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
it
is
an
unsettled
question
and
i
am
analogizing
to
baxter
v.
palmigiano
where
this
court
said
that
if
a
prisoner
asserts
the
privilege
at
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing
an
adverse
inference
could
be
raised
at
the
hearing
and
similarly
perhaps
if
a
probationer
asserts
the
privilege
to
a
probation
officer
the
probation
officer
could
draw
an
adverse
inference
and
that
along
with
some
other
fact
could
be
used
to
revoke.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
used
the
word
"contempt",
your
honor,
just
because
the
court
has
used
the
word
historically--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--it
means...
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
he
could
have
had
his
probation
revoked
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
so
said
for
refusing
to
discuss
matters
with
his
probation
officer.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
it
is
not
contempt.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
his
probation.
i
raised
it
that
way
to
say
that
he
was
facing
the
classic
fifth
amendmen
dilemma.
the
only
way
out
of
the
dilemma
was
for
him
to
assert
the
privilege,
and
the
issue
was
whether
he
forfeited
the
privilege
by
making
the
disclosure
or
in
other
words
did
the
probation
officer
do
something
or
was
the
situation
such
that
he
was
impaired
from
asserting
the
privilege
and
i
submit
he
was
because
of
two
factors:
first,
because
of
what
the
probation
officer
told
him
about
his
right
to
talk
to
a
lawyer;
and
second,
because
the
probation
officer
continually
made
representations
to
murphy
about
her
concern
being
only
treatment.
when
murphy
said
that
he
felt
like
calling
a
lawyer
he
said
you
are
not
supposed
to
know
what
i
have
said
in
treatment.
that
was
confidential.
i
feel
like
calling
a
lawyer.
murphy's
confidentiality
was
intimately
related
to
his
ability
to
assert
the
privilege
because
if
what
he
said
in
treatment
was
confidential
then
using
the
words
this
court
has
used
"then
the
cat
was
not
yet
out
of
the
bag.
"
and
murphy
could
still
assert
the
privilege
and
the
privilege
would
protect
him.
but
if
what
murphy
said
in
treatment
was
not
confidential
then
the
cat
would
already
be
out
of
the
bag
and
murphy
would
not
be
protected
by
the
privilege.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
the
constitutional
right
is
not
to
be
compelled,
but
where
the
government
leads
you
to
believe
that
the
cat
is
already
out
of
the
bag
and,
therefore,
you
make
a
disclosure
the
government
has
mislead
you
and
has
impaired
your
ability
to
assert
the
privilege.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
that
where
the
government
has
mislead
as
to
the
purpose?
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
no,
the
court
did
not
reach
that
point
in
oregon
v.
mathiason.
the
only
issue
in
oregon
v.
mathiason
was
whether
the
defendant
was
in
custody
at
the
time,
and
the
court
said
that
the
falsehood
that
the
police
officer
had
told
the
defendant
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
was
in
custody.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
whether
or
not
miranda
applied.
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
well,
this
case
is
different
from--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--the
old
authority
i
guess
is
the
first
case
bram
v.
united
states
or
shotwell
manufacturing.
the
court
has
said
in
the
context
of
a
compulsory
proceeding
you
cannot
compel
a
person
to
talk
by
any
implied
threats
or
promises.
so
i
am
saying
when
she
talked
to
him
about
treatment,
for
example,
she
was
impliedly
representing
to
him
that
the
purpose
of
discussing
this
murder
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
had
to
go
back
to
treatment.
she
represented
to
murphy,
your
honor,
no
less
then
three
times
that
her
concern
was
treatment.
she
said
in
her
letter
that
she
wanted
to
talk
about
treatment
for
the
remainder
of
his
probation.
when
he
got
to
the
office
she
repeated
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
treatment.
this
is
what
i
have
heard
you
have
been
saying.
when
she
said
to
him
you
can
deal
with
a
lawyer
outside
the
office
i
now
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
behavioral
relationship
between
the
false
imprisonment
and
the
murder
because
i
think
that
indicates
more
treatment.
now
this
is--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--whether
it
did
or
not
she
is
still--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes,
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
treatment.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
no
question,
your
honor,
she
had
a
right
to
ask
the
question,
but
she
has
to
ask
the
question
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
and
she
already
knew
that
she
was
going
to
go
to
the
police.
she
had
that
in
her
mind.
she
met
with
the
supervisor
and
that
decision
was
made.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
think
she
would
have
to
allow
him
to
call
the
lawyer.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
believe
he
was
aware
that
there
was
a
problem.
murphy
testified
that
when
he
was
confronted
with
this
by
the
probationer
flags
went
up
in
his
head.
he
said
i
felt
like
calling
a
lawyer
but
once
the
probation
officer
then
says
to
him
you
will
have
to
deal
with
a
lawyer
outside
the
office
because
now
i
want
to
talk
about
treatment
that
prevented
murphy
from
making
any
other
assertion
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
question
presented
by
the
state
of
minnesota
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
they
identify
the
fact
that
this
was
a
compulsory
process
and
that
the
probation
officer
had
substantial
reason
to
know
that
the
answers
would
be
incriminatory
and,
therefore,
the
privilege
was
self-executing
at
that
point
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
court
could
reach
that
issue
and
decided
whether
or
not
based
on
those
two
factors
the
privilege
would
b
self-executing.
i
am
saying
this
case
also
presents
itself
a
third
factor
whether
on
these
facts
the
probation
officer
impaired
murphy's
ability
to
assert
the
privilege.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
well,
it
is
really
a
legal
conclusion,
your
honor,
i
believe
because
the
facts
are
in
the
supreme
court
opinion.
the
facts
are
she
had
intended
all
along
to
report
murphy
to
the
police
and
yet
she
made
representations
of
treatment
and
she
told
them
he
could
not
call
a
lawyer.
these
facts
are
all
in
the
opinion.
the
court
said
in
more
general
language
than
just
limiting
it
to
the
two
factors
i
have
identified
the
court
said
in
the
same
paragraph
as
a
matter
of
due
process
where
this
probation
officer
had
already
decided
to
report
murphy
to
the
police
this
cannot
be
used
against
him.
so
i
think
the
court
can
affirm
based
on
the
facts
that
are
in
the
supreme
court
opinion.
when
she
told
him
again
that
she
would
not
let
him
call
a
lawyer
because
she
wanted
to
talk
about
this
behavioral
relationship
i
submit
that
when
he
first
said
he
felt
like
calling
a
lawyer
he
was
worried
that
the
so-called
cat
had
gotten
out
of
the
bag,
but
when
she
said
you
cannot
call
a
lawyer
because
i
want
you
to
talk
about
this
behavioral
relationship
at
that
point
it
was
fair
of
him
to
assume
that
they
were
only
talking
about
treatment.
indeed,
i
ask
the
court
to
look
closely
at
the
confession
in
this
case
because
the
confession
really
is
an
explanation
of
why
he
does
not
need
treatment.
his
confession
is
i
am
innocent
of
the
false
imprisonment
charge.
at
the
time
of
the
murder
i
was
on
drugs.
i
am
not
using
drugs
any
more
therefore
the
false
imprisonment
is
not
related
to
the
murder
and
therefore
i
do
not
need
treatment.
this
is
his
confession.
now
it
was
after
he
made
the
confession
the
probation
officer
said
well
you
know
i
have
to
go
to
the
police.
it
was
at
that
point
murphy
says,
well,
i
understand
that
and
then
he
says
to
his
probation
officer
you
must
really
care
about
me
to
have
me
come
in
and
talk
about
this
because
you
could
have
just
picked
up
the
phone
and
started
dialing
the
police.
again,
murphy
was
wrong
about
the
nature
of
his
confidentiality
rights.
the
federal
statute
is
clear.
the
probation
officer
could
not
just
have
picked
up
the
phone
and
called
the
police.
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
is
that
neither
the
treatment
center
nor
the
probation
officer
may
initiate
or
substantiate
a
criminal
prosecution
based
on
information
received
from
these
federally
funded
treatment
centers.
so
when
murphy
said
you
just
could
have
called
the
police
again
murphy
was
wrong
about
his
confidentiality
rights.
the
issue
in
this
case
does
not
turn
on
whether
murphy
was
in
custody
because
she
had
this
legal
power
to
compel.
the
significance
in
this
case--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--i
would
say...
well,
the
court
raises
a
very
difficult
question
there
because--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--my
view
is
that
it
probably
cannot
but--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--not
just
for
refusing--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--i
think
that
they--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
that
would
be...
in
a
sense
yes,
that
would
be
compelled--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes
it
was
compelled
but
yes
it
is--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--that
is
because,
your
honor,
the
values
underlying
the
self-incrimination
clause
go
to
protect
the
adversary
nature
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
it
goes
to
protect
the
nature
of
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
yes.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
would
say
in
this
case
they
could
not
be
used
against
him
for
the
purposes
of
revoking
probation--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--because
she
told
him
he
could
not
call
a
lawyer
and
any
amount--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--well,
when
a
government
official
who
has
power
to
compel
an
answer
to
a
question
tell
individual
that
they
cannot
call
a
lawyer--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--counsel
is
related
to
the
fifth
amendment
as
this
court
has
said
in
maness
v.
meyers.
a
person's
ability
to
assert
the
privilege
depends
in
many
cases
on
their
access
to
counsel.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
think--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--it
is
a--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--it
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding
such
as
a
criminal
trial.
there
are
some
due
process
rights
which
attach
to
it.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
your
honor,
you
are
setting
up
categories
for
me
which
i
am
not
sure
how
to
describe
the
ultimate
label
of
whether
a
revocation
proceeding
is
a
criminal
proceeding
or
perhaps
the
best
word
to
use
is
a
"quasi"
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
well,
perhaps
then
it
is
best
said
that--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--i
fully
agree
with
the
court.
if
in
this
case
let's
assume
that
the
law
is
that
where
a
probation
officer
uses
a
compulsory
process
to
deliberately
incriminate,
to
gather
evidence
for
the
police
that
the
law
is
that
that
cannot
be
used
in
criminal
trial
absent
some
sort
of
advisory
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
now
the
law
may
be
is
that
when
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
advisory
you
cannot
use
the
statement
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
trial
but
you
could
use
it
in
a
context
of
a
revocation
hearing.
the
reason
i
said
in
this
case
you
could
not
use
murphy's
statements
in
a
revocation
hearing
is
because
the
probation
officer
went
farther
than
that.
she
completely
undermined
murphy's
ability
to
assert
the
privilege
when
he
said--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--well,
your
honor,
the
court
raises
good
points
and
i
guess
my
position
is
that
once
she
cuts
off
his
total
ability
to
assert
the
privilege
by
saying
he
cannot
call
a
lawyer
that
if
he
comes
so
involuntary
at
that
point
that
it
should
not
be
used
for
any
purpose
whatsoever.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
my
position
is
that
after
he
said
i
feel
like
calling
a
lawyer
and
was
told
that
he
could
not
because
he
had
to
talk
about
treatment
that
the
probation
officer
completely
confused
murphy
as
to
what
was
going
on
in
that
conversation
so
at
that
point
to
the
extent
he
might
have
been
worried
about
a
criminal
prosecution
before
he
talked
once
the
probation
officer
told
him
no
you
cannot
call
a
lawyer
because
this
is
about
treatment
then
at
that
point
he
was
confused
and
he
thought
he
was
talking
about--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--no,
you
do
not.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
the
importance--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--the
importance
of
a
lawyer
is
this.
when
murphy
was
confronted
by
the
probation
officer
with
her
knowledge
murphy
was
faced
with
an
extremely
complicated
legal
situation.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
well,
he
felt
like
he
needed
on
and
he
certainly
did.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
the
fifth
amendment
says
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
can
be
asserted...
the
amendment
as
this
court
has
interpreted
that
the
privilege
can
be
asserted
in
any
language.
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
lawyer
to
know
how
to
assert
the
privilege
and
my--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--but
this
was
court.
this
was
a
compulsory
process.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
he
was
under--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--your
honor--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--but
this
court
has
said--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--it
is
not
a
courtroom.
i
will
concede
only
that
much.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
it
is
not
a
court
room.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
all
right.
not
a
court.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
by
court
i
mean
court
room
because--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--he
was
under
compulsion
to
speak
via
the
court
order
and
when
he
said
i
feel
like
calling
a
lawyer
i
am
not
saying
that
the
probation
officer
had
to
go
appoint
him
a
lawyer
at
that
time.
i
am
saying
murphy
was
attempting
to
assert
the
privilege.
he
was
attempting
to
find
out
what
his
legal
rights
were
under
the
circumstances.
when
she
prevented
him--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--murphy's
testimony
was
that
he
said
i
feel
like
i
should
have
a
lawyer
present.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
well,
he
said
i
feel--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--or--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--your
honor,
take
a
look
at
the
probation
officer's
response
and
then
work
backwards.
she
said
to
him
you
will
have
to--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--well,
the
probation
officer
said
to
him
you
will
have
to
deal
with
a
lawyer
outside
the
office.
there
is
no--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--my
point
is
that--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes
he
did.
but
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case,
justice
marshall,
that
the
lawyer
was
on
notice
that
murphy
wanted
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
before
he
talked
about
the
murder.
the
only
reason
he
did
not
do
that
is
because
the
probation
officer
said
to
him
you
cannot.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
absolutely
not.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
no
because
the
probation
officer
has
the
power
to
compel
murphy
to
talk
about
it,
but
like
any
other
compulsory
process
of
the
court
or
probation
officer--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes.
a
person
on
probation
has
full
fifth
amendment
rights
with
respect
to
new
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
would
say
he
would
not
have
a
duty
to
answer
that
question,
but
that
the
probation
officer
at
that
point
under
the
authority
of
baxter
v.
palmigiano
and
the
court
has
not
decided
this
issue
in
the
context
of
probation
but
that
the
probation
officer
could
at
that
point
probably
make
an
adverse
inference.
in
other
words,
when
the
probationer
will
not
talk
about
it
the
probation
officer
can
assume
the
worst.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
that
is
true
if
he
has
been
assured
that
what
he
says
is
not
going
to
be
used
against
him
at
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
i
agree.
when
i
say,
by
the
way,
that
murphy
could
not
have
been
revoked
just
for
asserting
the
privilege
the
state
of
minnesota
does
concede
that
if
murphy
had
asserted
the
privilege
there
would
have
been
a
revocation
hearing.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
yes,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
the
court's
point,
though,
on
that.
but
nonetheless
it
is
compulsion
whether
it
is
physical
force
or
not.
it
is
compulsion.
i
missed
the
court's
point.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
yes,
except
in
a
criminal
trial
where
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
the
finder
of
fact
from
drawing
an
adverse
inference.
i
do
not
know
how
enforceable
that
is
but
certainly
the
jury
cannot
be
instructed
that
they
can
draw
an
adverse
inference.
you
cannot
argue
that
they
can
draw
an
adverse
inference.
but
in
a
criminal
trial
you
cannot
draw
an
adverse
inference,
and
that
may
be
the
difference
i
am
suggesting
between
the
criminal
trial
and
the
revocation
proceeding.
it
is
an
unsettled
question
of
law.
the
cases
that
the
solicitor
general
cited
in
limiting
the
fifth
amendment
or
in
suggesting
that
this
court
should
limit
the
fifth
amendment
rights
of
probationers
are
first
amendment
and
fourth
amendment
cases
where
this
court
has
said
that
because
of
the
particular
institutional
needs
of
a
prison
system
the
government
can
limit
first
amendment
rights
and
fourth
amendment
rights
of
people
in
prison.
the
precedent
in
this
court
for
limiting
fifth
amendment
rights
of
people
convicted
of
crime
is
to
the
contrary.
prisoners
are
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
when
they
are
being
interrogated
about
new
offenses
while
they
are
in
prison,
and
this
court
did
assume
in
baxter
v.
palmigiano
that
if
a
prisoner
were
to
be
compelled
to
testify
at
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing
then
his
testimony
would
be
immunized
at
a
criminal
trial.
so
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
fifth
amendment
rights
of
probationers
should
be
limited
in
the
context
of
what
can
be
used
against
them
in
a
criminal
trial.
in
identifying
what
the
institutional
needs--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--yes.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
asking
the
questions
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
refusing
the
lawyer,
telling
him
that
this
is
just
about
treatment
and
i
would
add,
your
honor,
that
another
significant
fact
in
that
regard
is
that
at
the
time
murphy
talked
about
this
he
was
already
in
violation
of
his
probation
for
having
failed--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--i
do
not
believe
that
answering--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--in
that
hypothetical
the
judge
may
be
able
to
revoke
probation
on
that
ground
because
it
is
not
a
crime
to
refuse
to
go
to
treatment.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
but
you
can
only
assert...
when
you
are
under
court
order
to
talk
you
can
only
assert
the
privilege
as
to
those
matters
which
would
implicate
you
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
if
murphy--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--i
was
going
to...
the
reason
that--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--the
issue
there
would
be,
your
honor,
whether
you
can
assert
the
privilege
when
you
are
being
asked
about
something
which
is
not
a
crime
but
yet
is
a
violation
of
your
probation.
that
is
what
makes--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--well,
no
because
she
is
asking
him
tell
me
about
this
murder.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
if
the
fifth
amendment
only
protects
against
further
criminal
prosecutions
then
the
answer
to
your
question
is
he
could
be
revoked
because--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--similarly
about
drinking
at
bars
but
differently
about
being
asked
if
he
has
committed
other
crimes.
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
in
both
cases
there
may
be
some
compulsion
but--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--the
government--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--your
honor,
the
government
compel--
mr.
mark
s.
wernick
--there
is
nothing
illegal
about
the
government
compelling
information.
the
government
does
it
all
the
time
and
it
must
compel
information
in
order
to
function,
but
it
has
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment.
when
murphy
says
i
feel
like
calling
a
lawyer
and
when
she
tells
him
he
cannot
and
when
she
tells
him
as
to
the
nature
of
the
interview
she
is
not
conducting
herself
in
a
way
which
is
consistent
with
protecting
the
values
underlying
the
fifth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
all
parties
in
this
case
have
agreed
that
the
most
important
institutional
need
of
the
probation
system
is
a
trust
relationship
between
the
probationer
and
the
probation
officer.
if
this
court
puts
its
seal
of
approval
on
the
conduct
of
the
probation
officer
in
this
case
then
that
institutional
need
would
be
undermined,
and
i
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
