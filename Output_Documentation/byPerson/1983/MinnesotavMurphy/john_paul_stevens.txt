mr.
lynn,
what
if
minnesota's
parole
conditions
were
a
little
less
ambiguous
because
apparently
there
is
some
argument
about
what
they
really
mean.
supposing
they
said
in
so
many
words
every
probationer
has
an
absolute
duty
to
respond
to
every
question
propounded
to
him
by
the
probation
officer
truthfully,
fully
in
all
detail
concerning
conduct
during
the
probationary
period,
and
the
failure
to
respond
to
any
such
question
shall
be
grounds
for
revocation
of
the
probation,
would
there
be
any
constitutional
objection
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
construe
these
parole
conditions
to
require
any
such
broad
duty
to
respond
as
i
understand
your
argument.
i
would
think
the
interest
of
the
parole
system
would
be
served
by
maximizing
the
flow
of
communication
rather
than
by
creating
situations
where
you
have
got
to
claim
privileges
and
all
the
rest.
