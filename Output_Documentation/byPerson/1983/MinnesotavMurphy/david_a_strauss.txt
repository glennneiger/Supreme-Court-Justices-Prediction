mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
amendment
speaks
of
compulsion.
it
prohibits
the
use
of
self-incriminating
statements
only
when
those
statements
have
in
some
way
been
compelled.
now
what
is
notable
about
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
is
its
failure
to
identify
any
source
of
compulsion
that
forced
respondent
to
speak
against
his
will.
this
court
has
after
all
defined
a
test
for
determining
whether
confession
has
been
compelled.
the
test
is
the
familiar
one
whether
considering
all
the
circumstances
the
defendant's
will
was
overborne.
but
no
one,
neither
respondent
nor
the
court
below,
seemed
seriously
to
suggest
that
respondent's
will
was
overborne
in
this
sense.
he
was
not
a
juvenile.
he
was
not
mentally
handicapped.
he
was
not
particularly
vulnerable
in
any
other
way.
the
probation
officer's
actions
can
scarcely
be
characterized
as
intimidating
or
menacing
or
abusive.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
source
of
compulsion
they
seem
to
identify
to
the
extent
they
identify
one
has
something
to
do
with
the
probation
conditions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
they
were
insufficiently
precise
about
realizing
that
they
had
to
find
actual
compulsion
on
the
defendant
to
speak,
but
i
think
you
are
right,
justice
stevens,
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
two
answers
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
they
did
not.
but
even
if
they
had
imposed
that
that
would
simply
put
him
in
the
same
position
as
a
grand
jury
witness
who
is
under
an
obligation
to
speak
and
it
is
well
settled
on
the
basis
of
monia
and
cordell.
the
principle--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
that
is
right.
of
course,
had
they
construed
the
probation
conditions
to
require--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
probation
conditions
are
set
out
and
the
probation
condition
requires--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
do
not
find
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
opinion
explicit
instruction
of
those
probation
conditions
to
require
the
probationer
to
speak--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
probation
conditions
which
after
all
are
written
in
a
fashion
that
is
supposed
to
be
understood
by
the
probationer
say
he
must
be
truthful.
that
is
really
all
they
say
on
this
point.
as
the
state
has
pointed
out
to
be
truthful
means
not
to
lie.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
she
can
take
him
back
if
she
has
reason
to
believe
he
is
violating
his
probation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
certainly
not.
a
police
officer
who
is
interviewing
a
suspect
with
probable
cause
and
believes
the
suspect
has
committed
a
crime
can
arrest
the
suspect
on
the
spot,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
fact
that
he
has
probable
cause
means
that
he
has
to
give
miranda
warnings.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
yes.
that
would
be
compulsion.
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
she
never
said
that
to
him.
i
should
say--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
i
do
not
think
it
was
obvious
at
all.
i
do
not
think
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said
that.
i
also
add,
justice
marshall,
that
even
though
the
situation
you
have
described
which
is
not
this
case
would
constitute
compulsion
i
do
not
think
it
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think...
the
term
the
minnesota
supreme
court
used
is
pressure.
there
is
no
doubt
there
were
some
factors
that
impelled
the
respondent
to
speak.
usually
when
people
confess
there
is
some
sort
of
emotional
factor
involved
that
impels
them
to
speak.
but
pressure
and
influence
as
this
court
made
absolutely
clear
in
united
states
v.
washington
those
things
do
not
amount
to
compulsion.
compulsion
is
the
overbearing
of
the
witness'
will
and
the
fact
that
the
witness
was
influenced
by
some
circumstance,
the
fact
that
the
state
as
the
court
said
in
washington
created
an
atmosphere
conducive
to
truth
telling
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
was
coerced.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
our
view
obviously
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
is
that,
yes,
it
could
have
been
revoked.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
we
disagree
with
the
state
on
that
point.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
was
told
to
arrange
meetings
with
her--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--and
to
be
truthful
with
her.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
he
was
told
those
things,
but
those
are
different
things
from
being
told
to
answer
every
question
even
if
it
is
incriminating.
he
was
never
told
that,
and
he
never
asked
whether
he
had
to
answer
every
question.
he
could
not
conceivably
have
thought
that
just
asking
do
i
have
to
talk
about
that
would
jeopardize
his
probation,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
respondent
would
rather
not
have
discussed
the
crime
and
was
really
being
dragged
into
discussing
the
crime
against
his
will
because
he
feared
that
his
probation
might
be
revoked
if
he
did
not
discuss
it
that
the
most
natural
thing
for
him
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
say
do
i
have
to
talk
about
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
might
have
been
a
reason.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
she
did.
that
might
have
been
a
reason
for
him
to
cooperate
but--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--she
never...
no
court
has
found
that
she
made
any
promise
implicit
or
explicit
that
would
keep
the
information
in
confidence
and
would
not
use
it
and
would
not
go
to
the
police
with
it.
in
fact
at
the
end
of
the
interview
when
she
said
to
him
you
know
i
have
to
go
to
the
police
with
this
he
said
he
understood--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
there
were
some
sort
of
promise
given
by--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
no
apparently
there
is
not.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
gather
there
was,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
my
understanding
from
the
state,
but
that
is
different
from
there
being
a
restriction
on
the
information
that
the
probation
officer
could
give
out
on
the
basis
of
his
statements.
had
there
been
some
finding
that
she
implicitly
or
explicitly
promised
him
that
what
he
said
would
go
no
further
and
would
only
be
used
for
purposes
of
treatment
i
quite
agree
that
this
would
be
a
different
case
under
bram.
but
there
is
no
finding
in
the
basis
of
the
opinion
below.
it
is
plainly
not
that
there
was
such
a
implicit
promise
or
unfairness
of
this
sort.
i
would
also
reiterate
as
i
said
to
justice
stevens
earlier
that
even
if
the
probation
condition
are
construed
as
having
required
respondent
to
answer
every
single
question
that
just
puts
him
in
the
same
position
as
any
subpoenaed
witness,
and
under
the
monia
presumption
reaffirmed
by
such
cases
as
garner
and
roberts
and
by
the
mandujano
plurality
such
a
witness
has
to
assert
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
response
to
a
question
or
he
will
not
be
considered
to
have
been
compelled
to
answer
that
question.
the
reason
for
that
rule,
of
course,
is
that
witnesses
are
often
willing
to
speak
even
though
they
could
be
compelled
to
speak
were
they
not
willing,
and
unless
a
witness
objects
and
asserts
his
privilege
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
he
was
not
answering
willingly.
respondent
is
at
the
very
worst
at
the
same
position
as
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
it
is
our
view
that
it
could
for
the
reasons
that
justice
stevens
alluded
to
earlier
and
that
judge
frankel
expressed
in
an
opinion
called
mandujano...
called
manfredonia
that
we
quote
in
our
brief.
