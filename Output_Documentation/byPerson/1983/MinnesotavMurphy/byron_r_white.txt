byron
r.
white
in
this
case
which
is
no.
82-827
here
from
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
the
respondent
murphy
made
admissions
to
his
probation
officer
that
he
had
committed
another
crime
prior
to
his
most
recent
conviction.
these
admissions
were
relayed
to
the
authorities
and
murphy
wasn't
indicted
and
convicted
for
the
prior
crime.
over
his
objections,
his
admissions
to
his
probation
officer
were
used
against
him
at
his
trial
--
at
his
trial.
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
however,
on
appeal
held
that
the
use
of
these
statements
against
murphy
violated
his
rights
not
to
be
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
contrary
to
the
guarantees
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution.
we
granted
certiorari
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
we
have
filed,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
court.
in
our
view,
murphy's
rights
were
not
violated
by
the
use
of
those
admissions.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined
and
all
that
part
ii-a
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
