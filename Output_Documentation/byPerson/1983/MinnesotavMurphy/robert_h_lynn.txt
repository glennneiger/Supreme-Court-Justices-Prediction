mr.
robert
h.
lynn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
does
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
require
suppression
of
incriminating
admissions
to
a
rape
murder
made
by
an
out
of
custody
probationer
to
his
probation
officer
because
that
probation
officer
did
not
first
warn
the
probationer
of
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
a
divided
opinion
held
solely
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
the
fifth
amendment
required
suppression
of
these
admissions
despite
the
fact
that
respondent
did
not
claim
the
privilege
at
the
time
the
questions
were
asked.
instead,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
relied
upon
factors
this
court
has
expressly
rejected
in
at
least
three
cases
those
being
the
beckwith,
mathiason
and
bayhiller
cases.
a
state
court
may
not
impose
greater
restrictions
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
where
this
court
specifically
refrains
from
doing
so.
an
understanding
of
the
legal
issues
in
this
case
requires
an
understanding
of
the
facts,
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
those
for
the
court.
october
1974
a
seventeen-year-old
woman
is
raped
and
strangled
in
minneapolis.
marshall
murphy,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
was
a
suspect,
was
interviewed
at
that
time
but
was
never
arrested
and
was
never
indicted.
september
1980
respondent
was
placed
on
probation
for
the
crime
of
false
imprisonment
after
a
plea
of
guilty
in
that
matter.
the
conditions
of
his
probation
included
the
normal
ones,
that
he
report
to
his
probation
officer
as
directed,
that
he
be
truthful
to
his
probation
officer
in
all
matters,
that
he
keep
his
probation
officer
informed
of
what
he
is
doing.
there
was
also
a
specific
condition
of
his
probation
that
he
attend
a
treatment
program
for
sexual
offenders
known
as
alpha
house.
his
probation
officer
assigned
was
a
woman
named
mara
widseth.
for
the
following
year
probationer,
respondent
in
this
case,
and
the
probation
officer
met
on
a
monthly
basis
at
the
probation
officer's
office
at
times
usually
selected
by
respondent.
in
july
of
1981
respondent
left
the
treatment
program.
he
was
called
into
his
probation
officer's
office.
they
discussed
the
matter
and
she
decided
to
allow
him
to
continue
on
probation
despite
the
fact
he
was
no
longer
in
the
sexual
offender
treatment
because
she
felt
he
was
doing
well
in
other
areas.
then
september
22,
1981
the
probation
officer
learned
from
a
counselor
at
the
alpha
house
treatment
program
that
respondent
had
while
in
treatment
at
that
program
made
admissions
or
told
people
that
he
had
once
committed
a
murder
several
years
before.
when
the
probation
officer
learned
that
information,
of
course,
she
did
not
know
whether
that
was
true
or
false
simply
that
those
words
apparently
were
said.
she
did
not
go
to
the
police
to
learn
if
any
such
case
existed.
she
made
no
contact
with
any
other
authorities.
she
did
after
talking
with
her
supervisor
decide
that
she
should
relay
this
information
she
had
learned
to
the
police
and
she
also
decided
she
should
inform
the
respondent
probationer
of
her
decision.
so
on
the
24th
of
september
she
sent
him
a
letter
requesting
that
he
come
into
her
office
to
discuss
further
treatment.
she
was
concerned
at
that
time--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
there
is
a
problem
there,
your
honor,
unrelated
to
the
facts
here.
that
problem
has
to
do
with
the
confidentiality
of
the
alpha
house
treatment
program.
that
information
was
lawfully
transmitted
to
her.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
for
the
purpose
of
monitoring
his
probation.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
it
was,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
and
reporting
to
the
judge
who
was,
of
course,
monitoring
this
probation,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
there
is
a
substantial
question
as
to
that,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
imposed
by
both,
your
honor.
the
alpha
house
treatment
program...
this
issue
was
litigated
below
at
the
trial
court
level.
the
alpha
house
treatment
program
is
subject
to
certain
federal
regulations
dealing
with
alcohol
chemical
dependency
treatment.
there
is
also
a
state
statute
dealing
with
confidentiality.
the
trial
court
ruled
that
one
or
both
of
these
statutes
acted
to
prevent
that
information
from
going
to
anyone
other
than
the
probation
officer.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
they
did
not,
your
honor.
that
issue
was
not
on
appeal.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief
in
this
matter
had
he
validly
or
had
he
claimed
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
when
this
issue
was
discussed
it
is
my
interpretation
of
the
rulings
and
decisions
of
this
court
in
such
cases
as
lefkowitz
v.
turley,
lefkowitz
v.
cunningham,
garrity
and
others
that
he
could
not
be
so
punished.
he
could
not
be
revoked
for
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
validly.
in
other
words,
that
would
be
a
valid
defense.
i
do
not
believe
that
issue
has
been
litigated
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
but
i
believe
in
any
event
it
is
bound
by
the
decisions
in
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
yes,
your
honor.
in
any
event
then
after
this
letter
was
sent
to
the
probationer
a
meeting
was
set
up
september
28th,
again
at
a
time
chosen
by
respondent
at
the
office
he
had
been
to
approximately
12
times
before.
the
probation
officer
began
that
interview
by
telling
respondent
exactly
what
she
had
learned
from
the
alpha
house
treatment
program,
that
is,
that
he
had
made
these
comments
about
a
murder
and
that
she
felt
he
needed
further
treatment.
at
that
point
respondent
became
angry
and
upset.
he
commented
that
he
felt
like
calling
a
lawyer.
he
felt
that
his
confidentiality
had
been
violated.
she
told
him
you
will
have
to
take
care
of
that
outside
of
the
office
because
i
want
to
talk
to
you
further
about
further
treatment.
the
probation
officer
did
not
directly
ask
murphy
about
this
murder,
did
not
directly
confront
him,
never
threatened
to
revoke
him,
simply
posited
the
position
that
she
felt
based
on
what
she
had
learned
that
he
needed
further
treatment.
respondent
denied
that.
he
did
that
by
first
denying
the
false
imprisonment
charge
for
which
he
was
in
probation.
he
claimed
innocence,
and
he
said
further
that
at
the
time
of
this
rape
murder
he
had
been
involved
with
drugs
quite
heavily
and
that
since
he
was
no
longer
involved
with
drugs
the
two
incidents
were
unrelated
behaviorally.
the
probation
officer
confronted
him
with
his
guilt
on
the
false
imprisonment
charge
and
at
that
point
without
further
prodding
by
this
probation
officer
respondent
went
ahead
and
in
some
detail
described
the
1974
murder.
at
that
point
the
probation
officer
informed
him
she
would
have
to
take
this
information
to
the
police.
respondent
commented
that
he
understood
that
but
that
unless
he
confessed
to
the
police
it
would
simply
be
her
word
against
his.
she
encouraged
him
to
turn
himself
in.
he
asked
for
time
to
do
so.
at
that
point
he
began
to
cry.
he
said
he
committed
the
ultimate
sin.
after
some
moments
of
composing
himself
he
walked
out
of
her
office
unimpeded
and
left
the
building.
two
days
later...
the
probation
officer
took
no
action
for
two
days.
two
days
later
respondent
called
and
said
he
had
contacted
an
attorney.
he
had
decided
not
to
turn
himself
in
and
it
was
two
days
after
that,
in
other
words,
four
days
after
these
admissions
that
respondent
was
arrested
and
later
charged
and
indicted
with
first
degree
murder.
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
says
no
more
nor
no
less
than
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
your
honor,
i
would
make
a
distinction.
if
the
questions
asked
had
to
do
with
perhaps
noncriminal
conditions
of
probation,
for
example,
if
he
had
been
drinking
when
he
was
not
supposed
to
be--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--that
is
my
reading,
your
honor,
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
unless
the--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
it
may
well
be
and
there
is
some
case
law
in
lower
courts
and
in
the
circuit
courts
that
in
the
context
of
a
probation
officer-probationer
relationship
perhaps
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
application
whatsoever.
at
least
there
is
some
language
in
some
second
circuit
cases
to
that
regard
or
at
least
this
court
and
other
courts
have
recognized
that
probationers
like
prisoners
or
parolees
have
a
lesser
right
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
of
search
or
seizure
and
also
in
the
fifth
amendment
area.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
really
do
not
know
what
the
practice
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
my
experience
as
a
state
court
prosecutor
this
issue
very
rarely
ever
comes
up
as
to
what
transpired
in
the
interview.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
certainly
yes
it
has,
your
honor.
the
duty,
of
course,
is
to
be
truthful.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
believe...
your
honor,
i
guess
cannot
answer
for
the
state
of
minnesota
because
i
do
not
believe
that
that
issue
has
been
addressed
in
our
courts
either.
i
can
only
deal
with
what
is
the
practice
and
then
my
interpretation
of
case
law
in
the
court.
but
i
do
believe
that
if
it
is
a
valid
assertion
of
a
fifth
amendment
claim
and
if
a
probationer
has
his
full
right
to
a
full
fifth
amendment
privilege
that
he
cannot
be
punished
for
a
valid
assertion
of
that
privilege.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
only
to
the
extent,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
the
issue...
yes,
i
guess
i
am
saying
that.
that
issue
has
not
been
expressly
decided
by
this
court
nor
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
in
that
limited
circumstance.
if
it
is
a
fact
that
a
probationer
has
a
lesser
fifth
amendment
right
than
others
then
i
would
withdraw
that
concession.
i
do
not
know
that
to
be
a
fact
or
not
a
fact.
this
court
has
recognized,
however,
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
not
self-executing,
that
is,
it
must
be
claimed.
if
a
witness
under
compulsion
to
testify
makes
disclosures
instead
of
claiming
the
privilege
the
government
simply
has
not
compelled
him
to
incriminate
himself.
the
reason
for
that
rule
makes
sense
that
a
person
in
the
circumstance
as
the
respondent
in
this
case...
there
are
many
factors
and
circumstances
which
may
compel
one
to
incriminate
himself.
some
may
deal
with
government
compulsion
and
some
may
deal
with
the
person's
own
internal
feelings
or
notions
or
ideas.
unless
the
person
attempts
to
claim
or
claims
the
privilege
there
is
no
way
to
know
whether
or
not
that
individual
made
the
admissions
for
reasons
of
his
own
or
made
the
admissions
as
a
result
of
governmental
coercion
or
compulsion.
this
court
has
recognized
very
narrowly
limited
situations
where
one
who
does
not
claim
that
privilege
may
later
assert
it
as
a
defense,
and
those,
of
course,
are
the
inquiry
here.
the
inquiry
narrowly
is
was
the
defendant
in
custody
or
the
respondent
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
miranda
case
and
the
cases
following;
or
secondly,
absent
custody
were
these
admissions
somehow
coerced
by
genuine
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
government?
now
custody
as
defined
last
july
by
this
court
in
california
v.
baylor
means,
of
course,
formal
arrest
and
it
also
means
a
restraint
of
freedom
of
movement
of
the
degree
associated
with
formal
arrest.
in
the
facts
of
this
case
we
have
neither
a
formal
arrest
nor
a
restraint
of
freedom
to
that
degree.
the
condition
of
probation
required
only
that
the
probationer
appear
and
report
to
his
probation
officer.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
not
precisely,
your
honor.
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
said
in
their
opinion
that
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody
in
the
normal
sense
but
then
from
that
position
went
on
to
identify
three
factors
in
the
facts
of
this
case
and
expanded
the
rationale
if
not
the
holding
of
miranda
to
cover
this
situation
and
require
warnings.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
think
that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
what
they
did.
it
is
half
the
miranda
warnings.
it
is
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
the
warning
that
the
evidence
may
be
used
against
you.
they
left
off
the
counsel
part
of
the
miranda
warning.
this
court
has
never
adopted
a
warnings
and
waiver
requirement
in
anything
other
than
custodial
interrogation
as
that
was
defined
by
miranda
and
the
cases
following.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
the
probation
officer,
your
honor,
has
the
same
powers
of
arrest
as
a
citizen.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
it
is
located
in
the
government
center,
your
honor,
which
includes
the
courtrooms
of
the
county--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--it
is
in
the
court
building,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
under
our
arrest
statute,
your
honor,
there
are
powers
applied
to
a
peace
officer
and
then
there
are
citizen
powers.
they
are
almost
all
the
same.
a
police
officer
may
arrest
with
or
without
a
warrant
on
probable
cause.
i
believe
perhaps
the
specific
answer
here
is
that
if
this
probation
officer
had
something
amounting
to
probable
cause
or
reasonable
cause
that
a
violation
of
probation
had
occurred
she
could
cause
his
arrest.
probation
officers
do
not
carry
weapons
in
minnesota.
they
do
not
conduct
searches.
they
do
not
have
any
of
the
other
powers
that
you
may
associate
with
the
police.
the
trial
court
judge
ruling
found
that
this
defendant
was
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
miranda.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
implicitly
made
that
finding
by
not
requiring
the
entire
miranda
procedure.
i
believe
it
is
clear
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
defendant
was
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
miranda.
there
have
been
two
lower
court
holdings,
united
states
v.
miller
out
of
the
second
circuit,
united
states
v.
holmes
out
of
the
eighth
circuit
which
agree
with
this
conclusion.
i
presume
that
in
those
situations
the
probationer
was
under
the
same
sort
of
probation
conditions
as
respondent
was
here.
so
that
leads
me
then
to
the
second
inquiry.
is
there
anything
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
could
be
found
to
compel
or
to
prohibit
or
deny
this
respondent
the
free
choice
to
admit,
to
deny
or
to
claim
the
privilege?
i
believe
as
pointed
out
in
the
facts
of
this
case
there
is
no
identifiable
factor
here
which
interfered
with
that
free
choice
on
his
part.
she
never
threatened
him
with
revocation.
she
never
threatened
him
with
any
sanction
whatsoever
had
he
claimed
the
fifth
amendment.
since
he
did
not
he
cannot
now
raise
it
in
this
court.
again,
that
inquiry
looks
further
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
i
point
out
briefly
in
that
regard
that
the
probation
officer
was
acting
on
good
faith
in
the
performance
of
her
dual
role
(1)
to
assist
in
the
rehabilitation
of
the
probationer,
and
(2)
to
protect
the
public.
she
spoke
with
this
man
about
treatment
without
threats
or
without
coercion.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
a
few
points
if
i
may,
your
honor.
as
to
the
issue
of
a
mention
of
a
lawyer
in
this
conversation
on
september
28th
the
constitutional
right
to
a
lawyer
arises
in
only
two
circumstances
that
have
been
recognized
by
this
court.
that
is
the
in-custody
miranda
type
of
interrogation
where
the
request
for
a
lawyer
is
viewed
by
the
prophylactic
rules
in
that
decision
to
affect
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
rights.
the
only
other
situation
is
at
a
critical
stage
of
a
criminal
proceeding
and
that
is
the
true
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
neither
of
those
two
situations
applies
to
a
probation
interview
generally
or
to
this
one
specifically.
secondly,
just
to
reiterate
my
major
point.
the
privilege
in
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
asking
questions
or
asking
incriminative
questions.
it
only
prohibits
the
government
from
compelling
self-incrimination.
the
focus
of
that
inquiry
has
to
be
on
the
words
and
deeds
and
actions
of
the
governmental
agent
in
this
particular
case.
either
individually
or
in
combination
there
are
no
factors
identifiable
here
in
the
conduct
of
the
probation
officer
which
could
be
found
under
the
existing
decisions
of
this
court
to
compel
his
answers
in
the
sense
that
he
did
not
have
the
free
choice
to
admit,
deny
or
to
claim
the
privilege.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
i
would
generally
agree
with
the
court.
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
however,
there
is
a
problem--
mr.
robert
h.
lynn
--thank
you.
