unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
unknown
speaker
at
that
point
in
the
development
of
events
could
she
have
lawfully
told
the
police
without
first
talking
to
the
probationer?
unknown
speaker
for
what
purpose?
unknown
speaker
was
the
alpha
house
not
under
a
restriction
which
would
have
prevented
it
from
giving
information
to
the
police?
unknown
speaker
it
could
give
that
information
to
her
for
the
limited
purpose
of
monitoring
the
treatment?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
there
is
at
least
a
question
as
to
whether
before
talking
to
the
probationer
she
could
have
passed
the
information
on
to
the
police?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn,
these
restrictions
that
you
just
referred
to
in
responding
to
justice
stevens,
are
those
restrictions
imposed
by
state
law?
unknown
speaker
what
did...
did
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
pass
on
that
question?
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
not
before
us
either.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn,
if
when
the
probation
officer
questioned
the
respondent
he
had
refused
to
answer
on
grounds
that
his
answer
might
incriminate
him
could
minnesota
have
revoked
his
probation
for
his
refusal
to
answer?
unknown
speaker
you
would
concede
that
in
making
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
may
i
ask
a
sequel
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked?
you
said
that
if
he
claimed
the
privilege
he
could
not
have
had
his
parole
revoked
at
that
time.
supposing
he
were
asked
not
about
something
that
happened
prior
to
the
institution
of
parole
but
about
something
that
went
on
during
parole,
they
asked
him
to
report
what
he
had
been
doing
and
whether
he
violated
any
of
the
conditions
of
parole.
in
your
view
could
he
refuse
to
answer
those
questions
and
claim
the
privilege
and
still
not
have
his
parole
revoked?
unknown
speaker
no,
suppose
it
related
to
violations
of
law
occurring
during
the
period
of
parole,
is
it
your
submission
that
he
could
refuse
to
answer
those
questions
and
still
the
constitution
would
protect
him
from
revocation--
unknown
speaker
--well,
this
court
has
never
addressed
that
question
in
a
parole
context.
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
practice
in
minnesota...
you
are
relying
on
federal
law
rather...
is
it
the
practice
in
minnesota
that
the
parole
officers
in
effect
have
an
understanding
with
the
parolees
they
do
not
have
to
tell
them
things
they
do
not
want
to
tell
them?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
be
very
contrary
to
my
understanding
of
the
way
this
normally
works.
unknown
speaker
and
what
the
nature
of
the
duty
of
the
parolee
to
be
candid
with
the
parole
officer
is.
that
never
comes
out?
unknown
speaker
yes,
be
truthful
but
you
say
that
does
not
mean
you
have
to
answer
any
questions
if
you
do
not
want
to
answer
them.
if
you
do
answer
you
must
answer
honestly
and
that
is
the
extent
of
the
obligation
in
minnesota.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
qualifying
your
answer
to
my
question
then?
unknown
speaker
by
saying
you
do
not
know
if
the
probationer
has
a
fifth
amendment
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
withdraw
your
concession.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn.
unknown
speaker
do
i
gather
from
your
last
couple
sentences
that
it
is
your
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
thought
this
case
was
governed
by
our
miranda
decision?
unknown
speaker
i
more
or
less
read
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota's
opinion
as
saying
that
a
prophylactic
requirement
had
been
adopted
in
the
miranda
case
in
the
custodial
interrogation
arrest
situation
and
they
were
going
to
fashion
kind
of
another
miranda
doctrine
in
the
parolee
or
probationer-probation
officer
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lynn,
does
the
probation
officer
in
minnesota
have
the
power
to
arrest?
unknown
speaker
is
the
probation
officer's
office
located
where?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
court
building
or
the
police
building?
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
that
the
probation
officer
has
the
same
power
of
arrest
as
a
citizen?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
really
are
you
fairly
reading
the
minnesota
supreme
court
opinion?
they
say
because
of
the
compulsory
nature
of
the
meeting
because
defendant
was
under
a
court
order
to
respond
truthfully
to
his
agent's
questions
and
so
forth.
are
they
not
relying
on
compulsion
when
they
say
that?
unknown
speaker
you
may
disagree
with
their
conclusion,
but
they
did
not
ignore
the
requirement
is
all
i
am
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they
construed
the
minnesota
probation
condition
to
impose
a
legal
obligation
on
the
probationer
to
answer
all
questions?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
is
not
because
of
an
absence
of
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
what
they
are
saying
when
they
say
he
was
under
court
order
to
respond
truthfully
to
his
agent's
questioning.
does
that
not
only
say
you
have
to
be
truthful
but
you
have
to
respond
truthfully?
as
i
read
that
i
thought
they
were
holding
that
he
had
a
duty
to
respond.
unknown
speaker
as
you
know
a
statute
means
what
the
state
court
tells
it
does,
and
i
would
assume
state
probation
conditions
mean
what
the
state
court
tells
us
they
mean.
unknown
speaker
they
apparently
just
thought
it
was
rather
obvious
that
a
duty
to
respond
truthfully
included
a
duty
to
respond.
unknown
speaker
did
it
also
say
that
if
the
probation
officer
sees
fit
she
can
take
you
back
to
the
judge
without
any
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
consider
that
coercion?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
a
threat
to
have
your
probation...
suppose
she
said
if
you
do
not
confess
to
me
now
i
will
have
your
probation
revoked.
would
you
consider
that
coercion?
unknown
speaker
the
only
difference
i
submit
between
the
two
is
she
never
used
those
words.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
obvious
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
hoping
you
would
say
there
might
be
possibly
a
little
bit
of
coercion.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
this?
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
the
probationer's
probation
could
have
been
revoked
if
he
had
said
i
will
not
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
it
is
different--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
two
points
to
be
kept
in
mind
about
the
probation
conditions
to
the
extent
that
those
are
where
the
minnesota
supreme
court
located
the
compulsion
in
this
case.
one
is
as
the
state
has
explained
that
they
did
not
literally
require
him
to
answer
every
single
question,
and
i
think
as
most
naturally
interpreted
they
did
not
require
him
to
answer
every
single
question.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
they
imposed
on
him
a
general
duty
to
cooperate,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
if,
for
example,
he
thought
the
probation
officer
was
asking
a
question
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
probation
and
was
invasive
of
his
privacy
that
he
could
not
have
refused
to
answer
for
that
question,
for
that
reason.
it
certainly
does
not
mean
that
he
could
not
have
said
i
would
rather
not
answer
that
because
it
might
incriminate
me.
but
the
second
and
i
think
more
important
point
about
the
probation
condition
is
that
respondent
did
not
at
any
time
seek
either
to
clarify
the
meaning
of
those
probation
conditions
or
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
to
the
probation
officer.
now
had
he
been
unwilling
to
speak
with
the
probation
officer
he
would
surely
have
said
something
to
her
suggesting
his
reluctance
and
asking
whether
he
could
refrain
from
speaking.
was
he
not
told
to
talk
to
the
probation
officer?
unknown
speaker
and
talk
to
her.
unknown
speaker
and
to
be
truthful
with
her.
unknown
speaker
you
said
he
was
not.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
strauss,
would
that
be
natural
if
he
was
under
the
impression
that
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
was
to
make
sure
he
was
getting
appropriate
treatment?
would
he
not
think
that
the
right
thing
to
do
in
his
own
self-interest
would
be
to
cooperate
with
the
person
who
was
trying
to
help
him
his
treatment?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
what
she
told
him
that
she
wanted
the
information
for?
unknown
speaker
was
he
at
error
in
relying
on
what
she
told
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
knew
and
who
knows
whether
he
did
or
not
what
the
restrictions
are
on
use
of
this
kind
of
information
at
the
treatment
center
would
he
not
normally
have
assumed
that
he
could
go
forward
with
further
discussion
without
running
this
particular
risk?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
a
legal
promise
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
not
a
restriction
on
the
treatment
center's
use
of
the
information?
unknown
speaker
did
that
restriction
not
bind
the
probation
officer
until
he
repeated
it
to
her
face
to
face?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
if
he
did
plead
the
fifth
amendment
could
his
probation
be
revoked
for
pleading
the
fifth?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wernick,
are
you
saying
that
the
probation
officer
could
have
held
him
in
contempt?
unknown
speaker
is
that
kind
of
an
unsettled
question--
unknown
speaker
--to
add
to
my
education
where
is
this
case
that
you
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
not
answering
a
probation
officer?
unknown
speaker
contempt
means
contempt.
it
does
not
mean
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
contempt.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
wernick,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
keep
the
cat
in
the
bag
to
use
your
words
or
is
it
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
compelled
or
forced
to
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
same
thing
was
involved
in
oregon
v.
mathiason.
we
said
it
did
not
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
miranda
applied.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
your
authority
for
the
proposition
that
in
this
particular
case
they
would
be
different
then
mathiason?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
treatment
problems
that
she
was
dealing
with?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
answer
it.
unknown
speaker
so
she
had
a
right
to
ask
him
that
question.
unknown
speaker
what
reaction
do
you
think
there
should
be
to
his
reference,
murphy's
reference,
to
the
fact
that
she
thought
he
might
want
to
talk
to
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
indicated
he
was
aware
of
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wernick,
i
do
not
read
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota's
opinion
as
relying
on
implied
representations
by
the
probation
officer.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
asking
us
to
make
a
factual
finding
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
did
not
find.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
if
the
probation
officer
calls
in
a
person
on
probation
and
says
i
hear
you
have
been
out
drinking
in
bars
and
you
know
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
do
that.
have
you
been
doing
it
and
remember
that
if
you
refuse
to
answer
your
probation
can
be
revoked,
and
he
refuses
to
answer.
would
you
say
that
the
probation
can
be
revoked
in
that
circumstance
if
he
refuses
to
answer?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view
of
it?
unknown
speaker
it
cannot
you
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
suppose
the
probation
officer
says
if
you
refuse
to
answer,
of
course,
your
probation
will
be
revoked
and
the
fellow
says
well
i
will
answer
yes
i
have
but
he
says
you
have
compelled
me
to
answer
so
you
may
not
revoke
my
probation
or
use
this
against
me.
do
you
think
he
can
use
his
statements
against
him?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purpose
of
revoking
probation?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
not
compulsion.
that
would
not
be
a
compelled
answer?
unknown
speaker
yes
what?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
barred
by
the
fifth
amendment.
its
use
is
not
barred
by
the
fifth
amendment
even
if
it
is
compelled.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
case
i
guess
you
not
contend
that
there
was
any
physical
or
mental
coercion
in
this
case.
he
finally
answered
the
question
about
his
involvement
in
this
crime.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
those
statements
could
be
used
against
him
for
the
purposes
of
revoking
probation.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
all
flows
from...
you
say
it
is
not
a
miranda
case
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
a
counsel
case
not
a
fifth
amendment
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wernick,
is
there
not
another
factor
that
you
may
not
have
thought
about
but
as
a
matter
of
minnesota
law
is
a
parole
revocation
a
criminal
proceeding
or
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
because
if
it
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding
the
fifth
amendment
by
its
terms
does
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
would
not
apply
that
is
to
use
for
parole
revocation
purposes.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
it
is
a
criminal
proceeding?
if
it
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding
what
would
the
source
of
the
fifth
amendment
assertion
be
with
respect
to
parole
revocation
as
opposed
to
this
case
which
is
an
indictment?
unknown
speaker
well
the
constitution
does
not
use
the
word
"quasi".
it
either
is
or
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
use
that
might
be
made
of
his
answer
what
might
be
one
thing
in
a
subsequent
trial
and
might
be
something
else
in
a
parole
revocation
hearing
if
that
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference
does
it
make?
what
if
she
beat
him
up
to
get
the
information
out
of
him
and
said
the
court
requires
you
to
answer.
she
compelled
him
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
it
still
would
be
admissible
in
the
civil
proceeding
i
would
think.
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
objection
to
doing
it
unless
you
violated
some
other
right.
unknown
speaker
i
got
the
impression
earlier
you
had
more
or
less
conceded
that
in
light
of
murphy's
remarks
about
a
lawyer
that
he
did
not
need
a
warning.
a
warning
would
have
been
a
formality.
i
want
to
be
sure
what
is
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
usually
have
lawyers
at
probation
talks
with
prisoners
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
the
importance
about
a
lawyer
there.
unknown
speaker
asking
for
a
lawyer
at
the
probation
talk.
unknown
speaker
and
should
have
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
what
constitutional
provision
requires
him
to
have
a
lawyer
at
a
talk
with
a
probation
officer?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
if
a
man
stops
you
in
the
street?
you
get
your
fifth
amendment
in
court
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
a
court.
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
the
probation
officer's
office.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
court.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
a
court?
is
it
a
court?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
court?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
a
court.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
not
a
court
where
do
you
get
the
right
to
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
why
did
he
not
ask
may
i
go
and
see
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ask
for
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
he
said
i
feel
like
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
i
feel
like
i
am
king
midas.
that
does
not
help.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
would
rather...
i
usually
read
forward.
unknown
speaker
did
he
not
eventually
do
it?
unknown
speaker
did
he
not
eventually
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
to
know
if
the
probation
officer
said
all
right
i
will
get
you
the
lawyer
and
he
got
you
and
you
came
into
the
room
and
he
said
to
you
do
i
have
to
answer
this
question.
what
would
you
have
said?
unknown
speaker
no
obligation
to
answer
the
question?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
given
the
same
answer
if
the
question
had
pertained
to
an
alleged
criminal
act
after
the
beginning
of
the
probationary
period?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
then
said
well
i
want
the
information
solely
for
the
purpose
and
i
represent
to
you
it
will
be
used
only
for
that
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
to
revoke
your
probation.
would
he
have
a
duty
to
answer
that
question
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
true
then
he
might
as
well
answer
if
the
consequence
is
going
to
be
parole
revocation
if
that
is
the
maximum
consequence.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
rule
of
the
employee
discharge
cases
applies
it
follows
automatically
that
the
testimony
would
be
immunized
from
use
at
a
criminal
prosecution
but
not
from
use
for
discharge
purposes.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
matter
when
a
person
asserts
the
privilege
really
the
only
option
that
the
person
sitting
there
or
a
court
is
to
draw
an
adverse
inference
if
they
refuse
to
testify.
unless
you
are
going
to
get
out
the
thumbscrews
you
do
not
ever
literally,
you
know,
compel
anyone
to
testify
against
their
will.
it
is
really
other
devices
that
are
used
in
the
face
of
a
refusal
to
testify.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
suggesting
in
your
response
to
justice
stevens
that
there
was
something
peculiar
about
the
fact
that
the
remedy
would
have
been
to
draw
an
adverse
inference,
and
really
i
think
that
is
what
the
remedy
is
in
most
cases.
unknown
speaker
you
still
have
to
show
some
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
your
compulsion
in
this
case
was
just
asking
the
questions
along
with
refusing
him
a
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
then
consistent
with
your
answers
to
me
before
and
to
justice
stevens
if
the
probation
officer
says
to
him
i
just
want
to
check
up
on
your
treatment
now
have
you
been
taking
your
treatment
as
you
were
supposed
to
do
and
the
gentleman
says
i
refuse
to
answer.
i
will
not
talk
about
that
and
i
do
not
have
to
talk
about
that.
i
have
been
advised
by
my
lawyer
i
do
not
have
to
talk
about
it.
the
probation
officer
says
well
i
am
going
to
go
to
the
judge
and
am
going
to
revoke
your
probation.
he
says
well
you
cannot
do
that
i
have
been
advised
by
my
lawyer
that
you
cannot
revoke
my
probation.
would
you
say
that
he
could
not
revoke
the
probation
then?
unknown
speaker
just
for
the
refusal.
he
goes
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
says
i
revoke
your
probation
because
you
refused
to
answer.
you
refused
to
comply
with
one
of
the
conditions
of
your
probation.
you
said
i
take
it
that
you
could
not
revoke
the
probation
on
that
ground.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
we
are
talking
about
compulsion
and
an
answer
being
used
to
revoke
probation.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
told
me
a
while
ago
that
you
could
not
revoke
the
probation
if
he
asked
him
have
you
been
drinking
at
bars.
unknown
speaker
you
said
no
you
could
not
revoke
probation
if
he
then
said
it
is
none
of
your
business.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
drinking
one
and
that
is
the
treatment
one.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
in
my
example
i
said
he
just
asked
him
about
treatment.
are
you
taking
your
treatment
and
he
says
none
of
your
business.
do
you
think
that
probation
could
be
revoked
then?
unknown
speaker
and
similarly
about
drinking
at
bars.
unknown
speaker
then
in
neither
case
i
would
think
would
there
be
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
must--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
to
say
there
is
enough--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
to
say
there
is
enough
compulsion
to
keep
it
out
of
a
criminal
trial.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
problem
because
it
relates
to
antecedent
criminal
conduct,
but
if
it
were
not
for
that...
well,
i
guess
we
understand
each
other.
