and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit,
involves
the
propriety
of
the
labor
board's
conclusion
that
an
individual
employee's
honest
and
reasonable
assertion
of
a
right
that
is
provided
for
in

a
drop-off
point
to
a
landfill

miles
away.
the
garbage
is
hauled
by
tractor
trailers
and
normally
a
driver
is
assigned
to
a
certain
tractor
trailer
and
when
his
vehicle
is
in
for
repairs
he
may
be
assigned
to
another
one.

is
a

to
a

with
the
local
teamsters
union
covering
its
drivers.

condition
or

it
further
provides
that
it
shall
not
be

where

such
equipment
unless
such
refusal
is
unjustified.
a
further
provision
of
the
agreement
provides
that
the
employer
shall
not
ask
or
require
any
employee
to
take
out
equipment
that
has
been
reported
by

as
being
in
unsafe
operating
condition
unless
the
same
has
been
approved
as
being
safe
by
the
mechanical
department.
james
brown
was
a
driver
for
the
respondent.
he
normally
drove
truck
no.
245.
on
saturday,
may
12,
1979,
he
had
a
near
accident
with
truck
no.
244
driven
by
another
employee,
frank
hamilton,
when
the
brakes
on
244
would
not
stop
the
truck
at
a
landfill.
hamilton
took
truct
244
back
to
the
drop-off
point
and
with
brown
present
the
mechanics
told
him
that
the
truck
would
be
fixed
over
the
weekend
or
the
first
thing
monday
morning.
brown
returned
to
work
at
4:00
a.m.
on
monday,
may
14th.
he
took
out
his
truck
245
to
the
landfill
and
found
that
the
fifth
wheel
had
a
problem.
he
returned
to
the
drop-off
point,
talked
to
the
mechanics
and
learned
that
the
truck
could
not
be
fixed
that
day.
he
then
spoke
to
his
supervisor,
jasmund,
who
told
him
to
punch
out
and
go
home
after
confirming
that
brown's
truck
could
not
be
fixed.
brown
punched
out,
but
remained
in
the
driver's
room,
at
which
point
jasmund
returned
and
requested
brown
to
drive
truck
244.
brown
said
he
would
not
do
so
since
244
had
a
brake
problem.
jasmund
instructed
brown
to
go
home
and
the
two
had
a
heated
exchange.
another
supervisor,
madary,
came
on
the
scene,
and
when
brown
reported
that
244
had
problems,
madary
replied
that
half
the
trucks
around
here
have
problems
and
if
respondent
tried
to
deal
with
all
of
them
it
would
be
unable
to
do
business.
during
the
conversation,
brown
asked,
bob,
what
are
you
going
to
do,
put
the
garbage
ahead
of
the
safety
of
the
men?
madary
did
not
reply
nor
did
he
or
jasmund
make
any
attempt
to
show
brown
that
truck
244
had,
in
fact,
been
repaired
and
was
safe.
brown
went
home
and
later
that
day
he
was
discharged.
the
union's
recording
secretary
received
notice
of
the
discharge
that
day
and
he
and
brown
returned
to
the
plant
and
sought
to
get
jasmund
and
madary
to
put
brown
back
to
work,
but
they
refused
to
do
so.
the
next
day
brown
filed
a
written
grievance
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
alleging
that
he
had
been
discharged
in
violation
of
the
contract.
the
union
declined
to
pursue
brown's
grievance
beyond
the
first
step
of
the
grievance
procedure.
