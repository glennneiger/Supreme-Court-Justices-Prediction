unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
why?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come,
if
then
the
employee
had
filed
a
301
suit
against
the
employer
for
an
illegal
discharge,
in
order
to
win
that,
he
would
have
had
to
prove
a
breach
of
the
fiduciary
duty
that
the
union
owed
him,
wouldn't
he?
if
he
didn't
allege
that,
it
would
be
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
so
that...
but,
instead
of
doing
that,
he
now
files
with
the
board,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
come?
unknown
speaker
i
read
the
administrative
law
judge's
findings
fairly
carefully
and
i
am
interested
to
know
what
is
the
board's
position
as
to
the
reason
that
the
administrative
law
judge
assigned
that
the
company
used
to
discharge
brown?
why
did
the
administrative
law
judge
think
that
brown
had
been
discharged?
i
don't
want
exact
quotes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
company
contend
that
brown
was
discharged
for
failing
to
obey
an
order,
an
order
to
get
back
and
drive
244?
now,
would
the
board's
response
still
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
brown
is
purported
to
exercise
the
rights
given
him
by
a
promise
in
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
a
promise
that
the
employer
made.
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
there
weren't
any
specific
promises
about
equipment,
but
the
employer
promised
never
to
discharge
anyone
without
proper
cause.
i
think
that
is
a
normal
promise,
isn't
it?
you
don't
discharge
people
without
proper
cause.
so,
the
same
facts
happened
and
brown...
and
he
was
fired
and
he
claimed
that
that
wasn't
good
enough
cause.
all
i
did
was...
i
didn't
want
to
drive
a
truck
without
brakes
and
he
took
it
to
a
grievance
and
the
union
refused
to
press
it
and
then
he
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
don't
you,
in
effect,
say
that
any
breach
of
the
employer
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
it
results
in
a
discharge
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
union
could
or
would
ever
be
held
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
fairly
represent
employees?
unknown
speaker
it
has
them
there,
i
know
that.
unknown
speaker
such
as
the
right
not
to
be
fired
without
good
cause
even.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
the
interboro
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
okay.
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
about
the
interboro
doctrine.
supposing
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided
that
in
the
event
of
a
dispute
over
an
obligation
to
work
overtime
the
employee
had
to
work
overtime
as
requested
and
file
a
grievance
later.
and
suppose
an
employee
operating
under
that
contract
refused
to
do
the
overtime
and
simply
walked
off
the
job.
now,
would
the
interboro
doctrine
protect
him
even
though
he
had
not
complied
with
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
well
then
don't
you
have
a
problem
with
the
board's
treatment
of
the
contract
here,
because,
as
i
understand
the
contract
provision
that
he
was
working
under,
it
didn't
provide
that
his
refusal
to
work
on
the
basis
of
safety
would
need
only
be
honestly
and
reasonably
held.
i
think
the
contract
requires
more
objective
justification,
yet
the
board
has
simply
substituted
its
own
term,
i
think,
for
the
safety
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
slightly
reasonable
to
protect
the
people
in
detroit
from
hugh
sludge
trucks
running
around
without
brakes?
unknown
speaker
would
he
have
had
to
have
protested
at
all
to
invoke
the
interboro
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
does
exactly
what
he
is
told
up
to
a
point,
then
just
refuses,
walks
off,
gets
fired,
just
the
way
it
happened
here,
except
he
doesn't
make
any
statement
at
all
at
the
time
and
the
next
day
he
files
a
grievance,
as
i
believe
he
did
here.
is
the
mere
filing
of
that
grievance
a
sufficient
protest
to
invoke
the
interboro
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
would
the
board
recognize
any
distinction
between
firing
this
person...
firing
him
because
he
filed
a
grievance
as
opposed
to
firing
him
because
he
refused
to
carry
out
a
lawful
order?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
interboro
doctrine
isn't
limited
to
safety
at
all,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
the
answer
is
yes,
as
you
say
it
is,
and
the
board
thinks
it
is,
then
the
board
immediately
proceeds
to
determine
whether
this
contract
right,
which
is
a
protected
right,
has
been
violated.
and,
here,
it
would
be
whether
or
not
the
employee
actually
had
some
reasonable
grounds
for
his
actions
and
if
he
did,
why,
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
isn't
that...
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
and
they
would
also
do
that
even
if
this
case
had
gone
right
straight
to
arbitration
and
the
arbitrator
had
decided
that
he
had
been
properly
fired.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
employee
had
never
asked
the
union
to...
anything
and
suppose
no
grievance
had
been
filed.
why
couldn't
the
employee,
if
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
why
can't
the
employee
go
right
to
the
board
and
forget
the
whole
grievance
machine?
all
he
has
to
do
is
say
i
have
a
right,
it
is
a
joint
right,
i
am
expressing
a
collective
right
under
the
contract,
and
it
was
violated
by
the
employer.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
employee
never
needs
to
exercise
the
machinery.
that
would
just
make
mincemeat
of
the
contract,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
come,
does
the
board
make
it
a
practice,
when
the
employee,
in
fact,
initiates
a
grievance
procedure,
does
the
board
make
it
a
practice
to
pursue
a
complaint
in
cases
like
this?
interboro
says
you
may,
but
what
is
the
board's
practice?
does
it
do
it
as
a
matter
of
practice?
unknown
speaker
and
tell
the
employee
go
that
route
even
if
he
hadn't
started?
unknown
speaker
by
an
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
initiated
when
the
complaint
is
filed,
but
not
completed,
that
is
the
arbitration
proceeding,
the
board
then
proceeds?
unknown
speaker
they
will
wait.
it
was
completed
here.
unknown
speaker
they
filed
a
grievance.
it
was
rejected
and
the
union
refused
to
go
any
further
so
that
terminated
the
entire
procedure.
unknown
speaker
but,
their
regular
policy
now
is
that
not
to
defer
in
circumstances
like...
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
even
if
a
grievance
has
been
filed,
it
has
been
rejected
by
the
employer,
and
then
the
union
refuses
to
carry
it
any
further,
the
board
regularly
does
not
defer.
whereas,
if
it
goes
to...
if
the
union
agrees
to
take
it
to
arbitration
and
that
proceeding
is
not
completed,
then
it
will
defer.
but
now
if
there
is
an
arbitrator's
decision
there
against
the
employee,
what
then?
unknown
speaker
so,
they
sort
of
sit
in
review
of
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
was
told
to
go
home.
unknown
speaker
his
preliminary
instruction,
he
was
told
to
go
home.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
here,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you...
i
take
it
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
brown
had
said
i
won't
drive
the
truck
because
of
the
brakes
and
because
i
have
a
right
under
the
contract
not
to
drive
a
truck
with
bad
brakes.
then,
if
he
was
ordered
to
drive
and
he
refused--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
on
firm
ground
so
far
as
the
findings
by
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board
are
concerned?
did
the
administrative
law
judge
find
the
facts
as
you
say
they
are?
unknown
speaker
i
read
it
over
and
i
frankly
was
confused
as
to
which
of
those
it
was.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
he...
isn't
it
clear
though
that
he
refused
to
work...
he
refused
to
work
because
of
his
concern
about
the
brakes
and
that
the
board
and
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
he
was
exercising
a
contract
right
in
refusing
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
point
you
just
made
wouldn't
be
foreclosed
even
if
it
were
found
that
what
he
was
exercising
was
a
collective
right.
unknown
speaker
you
can
still
argue
that
it
would
be
a
collective
right,
but
the
board
is
just
misapplying
the
act
unless
it
wait
for
the
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
or
it
still
has
to
be
corrected
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
defending
the
decision
below
that
this
was
not
an
exercise
of
a
collective
right?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
are
defending
that
position.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
back
to
the
facts
again.
is
it
admitted
that
this
very
truck
almost
had
an
accident
which
his
truck
the
day
before?
unknown
speaker
because
of
its
brakes?
unknown
speaker
is
all
of
your
answer
yes
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
is
that
the
same
truck
that
almost
had
an
accident
with
him
two
days
before?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
while
we
have
got
you
interrupted?
just
on
the
issue
of
concerted
activity,
putting
aside
all
the
protected
questions,
and
you
made
reference
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
you
would
agree,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
he
had
been
discharged
for
filing
a
grievance
without
regard
to
its
merits
that
that
would
be
covered
by
the
act
and
that
would
be
a
concerted
activity?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that...
why
is
that
any
more
concerted
than
what
was
involved
here
just
looking
at
the
requirement
of
joint
action?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
are
prepared
to
assume
for
purposes
of
your
argument
that
that
individual
action
is
"concerted"
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
focusing
on
the
employer's
motivation--
unknown
speaker
--in
order
to
decide
whether
the
employee's
action
was
concerted.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
just
interested
in
the
word
"concerted"
at
this
point.
unknown
speaker
so
once
you
make
that
concession...
i
find
it
hard
to
accept
your
plain
language
argument.
that
is
the
reason
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
you
correctly.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
grievance
filed
here,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
so,
again,
why
would
his
assertion
be
any
less
concerted
than
an
actual
grievance?
unknown
speaker
in
these
facts,
when
he
was
fired,
there
was
no
grievance?
unknown
speaker
but,
he
was
asserting
the
very
right
that
they
filed
a
grievance
over.
unknown
speaker
when
did
he
refuse
to
drive
the
truck?
unknown
speaker
when
he
refused
in
the
evening,
why
didn't
that
give
rise
to
a
grievance
right
then
and
there
even
without
waiting
until
the
following
morning
when
he
could
contact
the
business
agent
or
the
shop
steward?
unknown
speaker
should
he
drive
the
truck
in
the
meantime?
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
that
i
could
be
protected,
because
i
drive
an
automobile,
from
a
truck
with
no
brakes
is
for
a
man
to
go
on
and
drive
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
his
only
way
was
he
would
have
to
drive
the
truck
and
i
am
sure
you
didn't
mean
that.
unknown
speaker
if
he
knows
the
truck
has
no
brakes,
he
has
to
drive
it?
unknown
speaker
on
the
road
with
me?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
me
to
make
that
ruling,
i
am
not
going
to
make
it.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
company
is
lucky.
what
is
the
fact
with
respect
to
what
repairs
had
been
made
over
the...
in
that
interval?
unknown
speaker
then
what
should
the
administrative
law
judge
do,
treat
that
as
a
presumption
that
the
condition
had
remained
unchanged
from
friday
night
until
monday
morning?
unknown
speaker
then
the
case
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
contumacious
refusal
even
to
determine
the
facts.
is
that
the
position
of
the
employer,
this
employee
was
guilty
of
that
kind
of
conduct?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals,
it
said
that
even
if
brown
was
exercising
a
right
under
the
contract,
he
wasn't
exercising
a
right
protected
by
section
7,
because
he
was
doing
it
just
for
his
own
account.
unknown
speaker
only
for
himself.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
defend
that?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
are
wrong
on
that.
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that
narrow
ground
which
is
the
ground
of
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
shouldn't
we
send
it
back?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be,
but
you
are
now
defending
the
decision
on
an
alternate
ground.
unknown
speaker
which
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
present,
but
we
certainly
don't
have
to
rule
on
it.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
issue
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
could
lose
on
the
very
narrow
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
and
still
win
the
case
in
the
long
run
on
two
or
three
other
grounds
that
you
have
already
argued.
unknown
speaker
do
you
cite
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
ufer,
american
freight?
unknown
speaker
was
it
nlrb
versus
american
freight?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
an
old
story
though
that
the
board
will
or
will
not
find
something
an
unfair
labor
practice
even
though
it
may
or
may
not
violate
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
also,
even
if
some
arbitrator
has
held
that
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
contract,
the
board
isn't
necessarily
foreclosed.
unknown
speaker
you
acknowledge
that?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
sort
them
out?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
say
the
board
could
never
second
guess
an
arbitrator
if
all
the
employee
ever
was
doing
was
asserting
his
own
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
why...
he
doesn't
mention
another
employee
or
anything
else.
he
wants
his
job
back,
he
wants
back
pay.
why
is
that
concerted?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
arbitrator...
even
if
it
had
gone
to
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
did
you
concede
at
the
beginning
that
a
grievance
filed
by
a
single
employee
is
concerted?
unknown
speaker
that
just
flies
in
the
face
of
your
plain
meaning.
unknown
speaker
you
should
retreat
from
your
suggestion
that
spielberg
is
enough
protection
for
your
provision
is
an
individual
grievance
has
gone
to
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
you
for
a
minute.
let
me
be
sure
i
get
your
position
on
this.
supposing
your
client
fired
a
man
for
filing
a
grievance.
there
is
no
contract
that
says
he
has
a
right
to,
just
say
they
set
up
a
grievance
procedure.
he
files
a
grievance.
he
gets
discharged
for
that.
unfair
labor
practice
or
not?
what
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
this
man
had
not
been
fired
because
he
wouldn't
drive
the
truck,
he
was
fired
two
days
later
for
filing
the
grievance.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position
on
it?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
is
that...
now
that
is
three
times.
[laughter]
you
answered
it
that
way
the
first
time
and
then
you
answered
justice
o'connor
another
way
and
now
you
have
returned
to
your
first
position.
if
you
are
filing
a
grievance,
you
are--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
say
that
is
concerted
activity.
unknown
speaker
any
contract
right?
unknown
speaker
any
contract
right.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
here
though
that
any
assertion
by
an
employee,
whether
on
his
own
behalf
literally
or
on
somebody
else,
is
concerted
activity.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
general
counsel
filed...
finds
reason
to
file
a
complaint,
why
there
is...
it
is
concerted
activity
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
doesn't
bind
the
board.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
it
is
concerted
activity
if
it
is
in
good
faith--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
