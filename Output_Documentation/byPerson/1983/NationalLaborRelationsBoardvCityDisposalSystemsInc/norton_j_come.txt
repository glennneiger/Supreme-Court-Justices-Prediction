mr.
norton
j.
come
the
record
indicates,
in
respondent's
exhibit
10,
which
is
not
printed
in
the
joint
appendix,
but
which
is
in
the
record,
that
they
found
no
merit
to
the
grievance.
apparently
the
truck
was
driven
later
that
afternoon
by
another
employee.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
board.
the
board,
upholding
the
decision
of
its
administrative
law
judge,
concluded
that
the
respondent
had
violated
8(a)(1)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
discharging
brown.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
brown
had
been
discharged
for
asserting
his
contract
rights
not
to
drive
an
unsafe
truck;
that
he
had
a
good
faith
and
a
reasonable
belief
at
least
that
the
truck
was
unsafe
and
that
under
the
board's
interboro
doctrine
the
assertion
of
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
contract
claim
is
concerted
activity
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
the...
if,
in
fact,
brown
was
engaging
in
concerted
activity
protected
by
section
7,
the
mere
fact
that
the
company
classified
as
as
insubordination
would
not
remove
the
protection
of
section
7.
there
is
an
issue
in
this
case
which
was
not
reached
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
would
be
open
on
remand;
namely,
whether
or
not
brown,
in
fact,
was
refusing
to
drive
this
truck
because
of
good
faith
beliefs
that
it
was
unsafe
or
whether
there
were
other
reasons
for
his
refusal.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
you
may
have
to
separate
out
a
couple
of
problems
in
your
hypothetical
example.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board's
basic
position
is
that
the
right
of
an
individual
to
assert
a
contract
right
in
good
faith
and
in
reason--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--is
protected
by
section
7
against
reprisal
for
asserting
that
right.
now,
it
does
not
follow,
however,
that
every
assertion
of
a
right
under
a
contract
can
be
followed
by
a
refusal
to
work
if
you
are
not
granted
your
claim,
because
if
there
is
a
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract,
the
activity,
though
it
may
be
concerted
might
forfeit
the
protection
of
section
7.
now,
in
this
case,
you
do
have
a
work
refusal,
however,
the
question
of
whether
that
would
render
the
activity
unprotected
in
our
view
is
not
presented
in
this
case
because
respondent
did
not
raise
that
issue
either
before
the
board
or
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
issue
that
he
raised,
apart
from
the
factual
one
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
fact,
it
was
safety
that
motivated
him,
was
whether
the
activity
was
concerted
where
it
involved
merely
the
action
of
an
employee
acting
alone.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
the
interboro
doctrine.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
don't
think
it
would
in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
because
the
contract
there
specifically
made
it
clear,
as
i
understand
the
example,
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
position
that
we
are
urging
here
on
our
reading
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
findings
which
the
board
adopted,
although
to
be
sure,
in
some
board
decisions,
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
whether
the
board
is
applying
a
purely
subjective
standard
or
whether
it
requires
that
the
refusal
not
only
be
in
good
faith,
but
reasonable.
the
facts
of
those
cases
will
show
that
the
decision
rests
not
only
upon
the
subjective
standard,
but
there
has
to
be
some
objective
basis
that
makes
the
employee's
claim
reasonable.
and,
the
alj
here
so
found
in
both
respects
and
that
is
the
question
we
are
presenting
here
and
that
is
the
submission
that
we
are
making.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
for
that
reason
i
believe
that
is
why
the
parties
negotiated
the
kind
of
contract
clause
that
you
have
here
which
guarantees
the
employee
not
only
a
safe
truck,
but
it
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
a
violation
of
this
agreement
where
employees
refuse
to
operate
such
equipment
unless
such
refusal
is
unjustified.
but,
a
point
that
i
want
to
make
though
is
that
as
we
view
the
record
in
this
case
the
unprotected
aspect
on
which
the
respondent
dwells
at
great
length
in
its
brief
here
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
the
only
issue
that
was
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
the
employee
acted
alone
in
forcing
a
collectively
bargained
right
made
it
not
concerted
activity.
that
is
the
interboro
doctrine.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
respondent's
position
and
for
that
theory
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
employee
here
had
merely
protested
driving
an
unsafe
truck
and
was
fired
for
making
the
protest
or
whether
he
momentarily
hesitated
or
whether,
in
fact,
he
refused
to
drive
as
he
did
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
he
has
to
give
the
employer
some
indication
that
it
is
a
contract
right
that
he
is
claiming.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
it
would
be
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
the
courts
that
have
disapproved
or
rejected
the
interboro
doctrine
and
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circumstance,
feel
that
to
discharge
an
employee
for
filing
a
grievance
is
a
violation
of
8(a)(1)
because
filing
a
grievance
is,
though
it
is
filed
by
an
individual
employee,
concerted
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
some
cases,
it
would,
but
as
i
tried
to
explain,
in
many
cases
where
it
would
be
a
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
to
refuse
to
work
the
activity
would
forfeit
the
protection
of
section
7.
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
of
the
special
contract
clause
here
which,
in
effect,
is
an
exception
to
the
no-strike
clause,
undoubtedly
for
the
reason
that
justice
marshall
pointed
out,
that
in
the
safety
situations
it
is
often
a
small
comfort
to
have
the
right
to
file
a
grievance
after
you
have
risked
your
life
and
lost.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
not
limited
to
safety,
but
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
interboro
doctrine
deals
essentially
with
the
issue
that
is
here;
namely,
whether
or
not
an
individual's
assertion
of
a
contract
right
in
good
faith
and
reasonably
based
is
concerted
activity
for
purposes
of
section
7.
mr.
norton
j.
come
then
you
get
into
the
further
question--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
board
will
defer
to
the
arbitrators.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
could.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
would
not.
i
mean
the
section
7
rights
can
operate
in
tantem
with
contract
rights.
mr.
norton
j.
come
for
a
time
under
the
collier
doctrine
the
board
would
defer
in
these
situations
where
there
was
available
a
grievance
arbitration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
if
that
were
available.
the
current
board
policy
is
not
to
defer
unless
the
employee
or
the
union
has
pursued
the
grievance
procedure
and
there
has
been
a
determination.
mr.
norton
j.
come
by
an
arbitrator.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
it
has
been
initiated,
they
will
wait.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
wasn't
completed
in
any
formal--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--well,
the
union
has,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
i
believe,
a
lot
of
reason
why
they
do
not
proceed
with
the
grievance.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
will
look
to
see
whether
that
complies
with
the
spielberg
criteria,
whether
or
not
the
procedure
was
fair
and
regular,
whether
the
determination
is
consistent
with
the
polices
of
the
act
and
whether
the
arbitrator,
in
fact,
decided
the
statutory
issue.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
not
to
determine
his
fact
findings,
redetermine
his
fact
findings.
however,
the
issue
before
the
board
and
the
arbitrator
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
interboro
case
which
was
the
first
performance
of
this
doctrine.
the
arbitrator
is
enforcing
the
contract.
what
the
board
does
under
interboro
is
to
protect
the
employee's
right
to
make
a
contract
claim
and
in
order
to
encourage
the
employee
to
exercise
his
rights
under
the
contract,
the
board
merely
requires
a
good
faith,
reasonable
assertion
of
that
right,
because
otherwise,
as
judge
mackinnon
pointed
out
in
the
banyard
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
employees
would
be
discouraged
from
asserting
their
contract
rights
except
in
the
clearest
cases.
so
that
interboro,
in
effect,
gives
through
section
7,
a
little
more
than
a
contract
does
in
order
to
ensure
that
what
the
employees
bargained
for
under
the
contract
they
really
get.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
our
position
is
not
that
every
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
is
that
discipline
taken
against
an
employee
for
asserting
a
contract
right
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
in
this
case--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
here
the
right
asserted
is
to
refuse
to
carry
out
the
employer's
order.
the
right
not
to
drive
an
unsafe
truck
doesn't
mean
anything
unless
it
applies
when
the
employer
assigns
the
employee
to
drive
the
truck.
so,
you
can't
separate
out
the
refusal
from
the
contract
right.
the
alj
and
the
board
found
that
factually
the
employee
had
this
contract
right
and
he
reasonably
and
in
good
faith--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct.
if
it
is
made
in
good
faith
and
is
reasonably
grounded
in
the
contract.
now--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--but,
nonetheless,
the
mere
issuance
of
a
complaint
does
not--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--that
is
correct
because
it
must
be
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--and
reasonably
based.
now,
the
second
point--
