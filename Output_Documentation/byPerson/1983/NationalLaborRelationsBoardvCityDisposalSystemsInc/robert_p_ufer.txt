mr.
robert
p.
ufer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
regarding
the
factual
background
of
this
matter,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
four
facts
clarify
the
very
narrow
scope
of
the
issues
presented
by
this
case.
first,
mr.
brown
did
not
warn
or
attempt
to
warn
any
other
employees
of
the
alleged
unsafe
condition
of
the
truck.
he
made
no
verbal
communication,
he
made
no
bulletin-board
message,
he
simply
went
home,
having
never
inspected
the
truck
or
driven
the
truck
for
over
a
year
prior
to
the
morning
he
refused
to
drive.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
his
final
instruction
by
both
supervisors--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--there
was
some
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
that
point,
justice
blackmun.
his
final
instruction,
which
respondent
submit
is
a
binding
instruction
upon
that
employee,
was
to
drive
the
truck
and
he
refused
to
drive
the
truck.
as
indicated
on
the
dismissal
sheet
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
he
was
discharged
for
disobeying
orders,
refusing
to
drive
truck
244.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
no,
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court
at
this
time.
continuing
with
the
facts
about
brown,
brown
did
not
ask
for
his
union
steward
or
seek
union
assistance
of
any
nature
on
the
morning
of
may
14th
when
he
refused
to
drive
the
truck.
in
fact,
another
employee
drove
that
truck
the
same
morning
without
incident
and
the
following
two
days
the
truck
was
driven
on
its
regular
shift.
the
fourth
factual
point
that
we
believe
is
of
critical
importance
in
this
case
is
that
all
the
parties
had
agreed
to
binding
grievance
arbitration
as
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
dispute
resolution
procedure.
now,
against
this
factual
background,
both
the
board
and
the
sixth
circuit
found
individual
action
by
brown
and
the
board
seeks
to
utilize
the
fiction
of
constructive
concerted
activity
under
the
interboro
doctrine
to
bring
an
individual
employee's
refusal
to
perform
assigned
work
within
the
scope
of
section
7
and
to
activate
the
board
machinery
to
resolve
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
dispute.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
if
he
articulated...
if
the
reason
for
his
dismissal
was
the
articulation
of
the
grievance,
that
is
correct.
we
would
not
be
here
and
we
have
indicated
that
in
our
brief.
in
this
case,
the
reason
for
his
dismissal
was
the
refusal
to
drive
the
truck,
not
to
the
submittal
of
the
grievance.
the
submittal
of
the
grievance
came--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--the
indication...
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
is
that
brown
was
discharged
for
refusing
to
follow
a
company
order.
there
is
not
a
holding
by
the
administrative
law
judge
that
he
was
discharged
for
filing
a
grievance.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
think--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--the
board...
it
is
our
position
that
the
board
does
not...
the
arbitrator
has
provided
for...
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
arbitrator
is
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
brown's
conduct
was
justified
when
he
refused
to
drive
the
truck
under
section
xxi
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
what
the
board
does,
as
indicated
in
its
american
freight
decision,
it
will
come
in
and
apply
a
lesser
standard,
essentially
subjective,
good
faith
standard,
not
the
standard
determined
and
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
to
the
contract.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
don't
believe
the
board
made
that
determination
or
had
the
right
to
make
that
determination.
we
respectfully
submit
that
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
should
be
interpreted
by
this
court
according
to
it
plain
meaning.
we
believe
this
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
both
issues
are
raised
in
this
case.
counsel
for
the
board
has
indicated
that
we
have
not
raised
the
protected
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
in
exception
number
one
we
specifically
raised
the
issue
whether
brown's
refusal
to
drive
the
work...
i
believe
the
language
that
we
utilized
in
that
situation
was...
we
made
the
exception
whether
the
charging
party,
james
brown
was
engaged
in
concerted
activity
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act
when
he
refused
to
drive
the
truck.
so,
it
is
our
position
that
both
the
protected
and
the
concerted
issues
are
raised
in
this
case
and
under
either
ground
there
is
no
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
are
defining
that
position.
we
are
also
defending
the
position
that
it
is
not
protected
in
that
rather
than
working
and
grieving
he
walked
off
the
job.
that
violates
the
no-strike
cause
which
is
very
broad
in
this
contract.
and,
even
if
mr.
brown
had
been
accompanied
by
five
other
employees,
had
they
simply
walked
off
the
job
while
the
conduct
may
have
been
concerted
under
section
7,
it
would
not
have
been
protected.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
it
was
two
days
before.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
justice
marshall,
two
days
before
there
was
almost
an
accident
at
the
landfill,
but
the
driver
of
the
truck
at
that
time
continued
to
drive
the
subject
truck
and
when
he
took
it
back
to
the
mechanics,
the
mechanics
told
him
they
would
fix
it
over
the
weekend
or
first
thing
monday
morning.
mr.
brown
came
in
after
having
already
made
a
run
monday
morning.
he
then
never
went
to
the
truck
to
make
an
inspection
as
required
by
company
policy.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
all
of
my
answer--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--it
was
the
same
truck.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
if
that
was
the
motivation
for
his
discharge,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
don't
believe
this
court
has
spoken
to
that
issue.
a
number
of
circuit
courts
that
have
spoken
to
that
issue
have
found
the
submittal
of
a
grievance,
the
formal
submittal
of
a
grievance
to
be
concerted
and
they
may
have
gone
on
the
ground
that
policy
considerations,
that
that
furthers
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
and
dispute
resolution
mechanism.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
a
formal
assertion
of
a
contract
violation
and
the
formal
grievance,
if
the
motivation...
and
we
would,
under
the
analysis
this
court
set
forth
in
bernhart
and
sims,
if
the
motivation
is
the
submittal
of
that
grievance
and
not
the
underlying--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
in
order
to
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
need
in
the
first
instance--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--fine.
we
are
conceding
that
a
formal
grievance
submittal,
that
act
in
and
of
itself,
is
concerted.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
think
there
is
some
kind
of
contradiction
in
that
regard.
we
acknowledge
that
difficulty.
in
the
face
of
the
circuit
court
decisions,
i
think,
again,
they
went
under
the
policy
considerations
to
promote
the
grievance
and
to
make
sure
there
isn't
a
chilling
effect
of
the
access
to
grievance
and
they
indulge...
i
think
possibly
you
might
under
the
mushroom
transportation
test,
where
you
are
preparing
for
or
inducing
concerted
activity,
that
that
explains
a
grievance
situation
or
very
possibly
a
grievance
situation
could
be
explained
under
the
assisting
labor
organizations,
the
earlier
language
in
section
7
of
the
act,
and
that
it
does
not
have
to
go--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--there
was
not
a
grievance
at
the
time
of
the
discharge.
there
was
a
grievance
subsequent
in
time.
i
believe
it
was
filed
the
next
morning.
it
is
very
clear
in
this
case--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--we
believe
that
in
that
situation,
if
the
court
is
going
to
find--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
the
record
is
clear
that
there
is
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
mr.
brown.
there
is
simply
a
confrontation
between
mr.
brown
and
his
supervisor
where
his
supervisor
is
instructing
him
to
drive
the
truck
and
brown
is
saying
he
does
not
want
to
drive
the
truck
and
that
the
truck
is
unsafe.
there
is
no
reference
to
any
term
or
section
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
no
mention
of
the
word
"grieve"
or
even
the
term
"collective
bargaining
agreement",
nor
does
he
ask
for
his
union
steward
or
for
an
union
official.
and,
in
that
case
we
would
distinguish
this
situation
from
a
formal
grievance
for
those
reasons.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
on
the
morning--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--i
believe,
in
fact,
he
made
contact
with
his
shop
steward
and
came
in
that
afternoon.
and,
what
we
are
saying,
to
come
within
the
protection
of
section
7,
an
employee
has
got
to
afford
the
employer
some
notice
as
to
what
it
is
that
he
is
doing
besides
simply
stating--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--he
should
drive
the
truck
in
the
meantime.
he
has...
it
is
respondent's
position
that
if
he
does
not
drive
the
truck...
if
he
makes
the
unilateral,
individual
determination
not
to
drive
the
truck,
then
he
has
either
got
to
come
within
the
justified
language
set
forth
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
found
by
the
union
and
ultimately
an
arbitrator
to
excuse
his
refusal
or
he
must
come
within
the
standard
in
section
502
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
congress
spoke
specifically
and
established
a
standard
where
an
individual
employee
can
refuse
to
undertake
a
job
assignment.
that
standard
is
clearly
a
higher
standard
of
abnormally
dangerous
condition
in
an
objective
showing
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
gateway
coal
decision.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
believe
what
he
would
have
to
do
is
make
a
showing--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--what
i
meant
to
say,
justice
marshall,
is
that
if
he
does
not
drive
the
truck,
if
he
makes
that
determination,
then
he
does
so
at
his
peril
and
he
must
be
vindicated
by
the
arbitrator.
and,
if
the
arbitrator
finds--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--he
has
to...
there
has
to
be--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--he
has
to
make--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--justice
marshall,
what
i
would
want
in
this
case
would
be
consistent
with
company
policy
that
if
he
is
going
to
refuse
to
drive
the
truck
at
a
minimum
he
inspect
the
truck
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
has
been
fixed.
in
this
case,
it
is
company
policy
to
inspect
the
truck
and
it
is
clear
from
the
record
he
never
went
anywhere
near
the
truck
nor
had
driven
the
truck
for
a
year
prior
to
his
refusing
to
drive
it.
another
driver
drove
that
same
truck
without
incident
later
that
morning.
so,
in
that
setting,
we
are
stating
that
the
dismissal
was
justified.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
the
record
is
silent,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
think,
consistent
with
the
union
determination
that
the
grievance
didn't
have
merit,
that
the
substantial
evidence
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
where
he
does
not
inspect
the
truck,
contrary
to
company
policy,
and
where
the
truck
is
that
same
morning
driven
by
another
employee
without
incident,
i
think
in
that
situation
that
the
logical
inference
and
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
truck
had
been
repaired,
but
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
point.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
we
believe,
returning
to
the
definition
of
concerted,
looking
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
did
congress
indicate
anything
that
would
indicate
something
other
than
a
plain
meaning
interpretation
of
concerted.
we
submit
there
is
nothing
to
that
effect.
on
the
contrary,
congress
spoke
in
two
important
regards
that
support
a
plain-meaning
interpretation
in
this
case.
in
proposed
section
8(a)(6)
in
the
taft-hartley
amendment,
congress
considered
and
specifically
rejected
this
section
8(a)(6)
which
would
have
made
an
employer's
collective
bargaining
agreement
contract
violation
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
submit
that
the
board's
interboro
doctrine
effectuates
the
very
end
that
congress
considered
and
rejected
when
it
adopted
section
8(a)(6).
the
interboro
doctrine
transforms
alleged
collective
bargaining
agreement
violations
and
in
some
instances
non-violation
into
unfair
labor
practices
at
the
option
of
the
employee.
in
the
c
&
c
plywood
case,
before
this
court
which
involved
the
unilateral
company
implementation
of
a
premium
pay
plan
during
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
this
court
reviewed
the
section
8(a)(6)
legislative
history
and
specifically
concluded
that
congress
had
not
given
the
board
the
broad
generalized
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
rights
of
parties
under
all
collective
bargaining
agreements,
that
congress
has
specifically
chosen
to
leave
collective
bargaining
agreement
enforcement
to
the
usual
processes
of
law
under
section
301.
we
believe
interboro
contravenes
this
principle
of
c
&
c
plywood.
congress
spoke
in
another
regard.
they
implemented
section
502
of
the
act
and
provided
a
specific
safety
standard
to
allow
immediate
work
stoppage.
we
submit
there
is
no
justification
for
the
board
to
use
the
interboro
doctrine
to
construe
a
lesser
standard
from
within
this
very
same
act.
in
the
gateway
coal
decision,
this
court
interpreted
section
502
as
not
allowing
work
stoppages
under
the
slender
thread
of
subjective
judgment.
there
was
a
need
for
objective
evidence
of
an
abnormally
dangerous
condition
as
required
in
section
502,
yet
the
board,
through
the
interboro
doctrine
construes
a
subjective
standard
in
many
instances
in
contravention
of
502
and
in
contravention
of
the
gateway
coal
holding.
we
respectfully
submit
to
affirm
the
interboro
doctrine
is
to
disregard
this
legislative
history
and
this
court's
pronouncements
in
c
&
c
plywood
and
in
gateway
coal
and
it
is
to
allow
the
board
to
expand
its
jurisdiction
contrary
to
unambiguous
language
in
section
7
and
congress'
clear
intention.
faced
with
a
problem
of
the
act's
plain
meaning
and
the
legislative
history
surrounding
section
502
and
proposed
section
8(a)(6)--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
do.
we
believe--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--we
believe
in
this
case
it
is
established
in
the
record
that
his
action,
if
it
were
found
to
be
concerted,
it
is
nevertheless
not
protected
in
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
also.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
believe
it
was
and
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
expressed
its
complete
agreement
with
the
kohls
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit,
we
believe
that
that
incorporated
the
protection
argument
and
i
think
the
board
has
acknowledged
that
in
their
reply
brief.
both
issues
were
considered
and,
in
fact,
addressed
by
implication
by
this--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position.
now,
faced
with
the
act's
plain
meaning
in
the
legislative
history,
the
board
turns
to
a
different
argument
and
asserts
that
the
court
should
defer
to
its
interpretation.
we
would
simply
like
to
point
out
in
this
regard
that
in
the
weingarten
decision
of
this
court,
the
court
indicated
that
it
should
not
step
aside
and
rubber
stamp
the
board's
determinations
that
run
contrary
to
the
language
and
the
tenor
of
the
act.
similarly,
in
the
edward
debartolo
corporation
decision
earlier
this
spring,
a
decision
interpreting
section
8(b)(4),
the
publicity
proviso
and
the
distribution
requirements
provided
therein,
this
court
expressly
did
not
allow
the
nlrb
to
apply
so
generous
a
standard
as
to
strip
the
statutory
restriction
from
the
act.
if
congress
had
intended
that
broad
a
scope,
they
would
not
have
placed
the
restriction
in
the
act
in
the
first
instance.
we
submit
that
the
board
is
doing
precisely
this
thing
with
the
interboro
doctrine.
they
are
asking
the
court
to
step
aside
and
rubber
stamp
their
determination
and
that
determination
is
utilizing
a
standard
so
generous
as
to
strip
the
concerted
requirement
from
section
7.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
policy
underlying
deference
to
the
board
as
was
articulated
in
weingarten
was
to
allow
the
board
to
construe
the
statute
in
light
of
changing
patterns
of
industrial
life,
yet
the
most
significant
changing
pattern
here
is
the
imergence
of
binding
arbitration
as
a
favored
dispute
resolution
procedure,
to
utilize
self-government
in
the
work
place
through
grievance
arbitration.
the
interboro
doctrine
flies
in
the
face
of
this
fundamental
emerging
pattern
of
industrial
life
and
we
submit
for
that
reason
it
is
not
appropriate
to
afford
the
board
any
deference
in
its
determination.
policy
considerations,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
also
do
not
justify
a
departure
from
a
plain-meaning
interpretation
of
concerted.
we
submit
that
it
is
clear
the
interboro
doctrine
frustrates
and
does
not
serve
fundamental
national
labor
policies.
addressing
specific
labor
policies,
the
need
for
certainty
is
of
critical
importance
in
labor
relations
to
maintain
and
promote
industrial
stability,
particular
in
situations
of
employee
discharges
and
potential
work
stoppages.
yet,
the
interboro
doctrine
kept
all
of
the
parties,
including
the
employees,
adrift
on
a
sea
of
total
uncertainty.
it
takes
only
a
cursory
review
of
the
board's
interboro
decisions
over
the
past
few
years
to
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
this
uncertainty.
there
are
conflicting
board
and
arbitration
decisions.
we
believe
this
is
highlighted
by
the
american
freight
decision.
in
american
freight,
the
board
found
the
employer
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
enforcing
his
contract
right
as
affirmed
by
the
arbitrator.
the
arbitrator
in
that
case
concluded
there
was
no
contract
violation,
yet
the
board
stepped
in
and
said,
well,
we
apply
a
lesser
standard
and
they
found
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
do.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
there
are
similarly
conflicting
and
contradictory
board
decisions.
we
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
very
recent
board
decision
in
comet
fast
freight.
when
that
case
is
analyzed
against
the
kohls
decision
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
in
the
instant
case,
almost
all
of
the
critical
facts
are
identical.
it
is
a
truck
safety
issue.
the
employee
asserts
he
does
not
want
to
drive
the
truck.
there
is
no
discussion
or
warning
to
any
other
employees,
and,
in
fact,
another
employee
in
each
one
of
these
cases
drove
the
truck
that
very
same
day.
yet
the
board
reached
opposite
legal
conclusions.
they
found
there
was
no
concerted
activity
in
comet
fast
freight.
this
comet
fast
freight
decision
would
seem
to
invite
inquiry
by
this
court
of
the
board's
counsel
whether
the
nlrb
has
recently
changed
its
position
on
interboro,
whether
the
board
has
stepped
back
from
interboro.
we
would
submit
either
the
board
has
changed
its
position
or
its
application
of
the
doctrine
is
totally
inconsistent.
similarly,
the
yellow
fast
freight
board
decision
which
is
another
recent
board
decision
that
is
cited
in
the
board's
reply
brief
is
also
hopelessly
contradictory
with
earlier
precedent.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
individual
employee's
refusal
to
drive
the
truck
and
it
was
only
a
momentary
refusal,
engaging
for
some
15
to
20
minutes
with
his
supervisor
as
to
whether
or
not
his
driving
a
truck
would
violate
the
contract
term
relating
to
safety.
the
board
concluded
that
that
conduct
constituted
insubordination
and,
therefore,
not
protected
against.
that
conduct
is
lesser
conduct
than
in
the
instant
case
where
the
employee
walks
off
the
job
and
doesn't
perform
the
work
at
all.
we
would
submit
that
another
fundamental
uncertainty
arises
from
the
interboro
doctrine
in
that
it
denies
all
of
the
parties
their
agreed-upon,
substantive,
contract
term.
it
essentially
makes
mincemeat
out
of
the
contract
because
the
board
is
stepping
in
and
applying,
as
in
american
freight...
it
specifically
indicates
it
is
applying
a
lesser
substantive
safety
standard.
we
further
submit
with
respect
to
uncertainty
that
there
are
inordinate
delays
that
compound
the
uncertainty
in
this
whole
area
where
the
board
intervenes.
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
there
is
often
specific
time
frames
provided
for
the
grievance
procedure
and
ultimately
arbitration.
these
often
conclude
within
30
to
60
or
90
days
at
the
outside.
using
this
case
as
an
example,
the
board
decision
was
not
reached
until
over
two
years
after
the
incident
occurred
and
with
the
appeals
through
the
court
there
is
even
greater
delay.
turning
to
other
policy
considerations
which
we
believe
are
of
vital
important,
interboro
creates
an
entirely
duplicative
procedural
structure
for
collective
bargaining
agreement
dispute
resolution
with
all
of
the
attendant
time,
uncertainty
and
expense
of
duplication.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
that
is
correct.
i
think--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
acknowledge
that.
we
believe
the
qualitative
distinction
with
respect
to
the
interboro
doctrine
is
that
it
transforms
all
collective
bargaining
agreement
disputes
into
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
would
return
to
an
actual
plain
meaning
interpretation
of
concerted
is
our
position,
and,
if,
in
fact,
there
are
two
or
more
employees
undertaking
an
action
or
agreeing
upon
a
course
of
action--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--the
board...
i
think
the
correct
standard
for
the
board's
intervention
in
that
case
would
be
the
spielberg
doctrine
of
fairness
and
reasonable.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
it
is
our
position
that
would
not
be
concerted.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
i
think
the
clarification
in
that
regard...
the
first
position
is
that
the
action
would
not
be
concerted
by
the
individual,
and
the
second
position
would
be
it
would
be
appropriate
for
deferral
to
the
arbitrator.
and,
i
think
on
either
of
those
two
grounds
the
employer's
conduct
could
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
don't...
in
light
of
the
circuit
court
decision
on
that
point,
we
believe
that
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
to
that
effect,
but
again--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
is
correct
and
if
i
made
that
concession,
then
very
possibly
i
ought
to
retreat
from
that,
because
i
think
a
plain
meaning
interpretation
offers
certainty
into
this
situation
and
that
it
is--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--i
believe
that
is
a
separate
issue
and
those
standards,
as
they
have
more
recently
evolved
in
board
decisions,
i
think
there
has
been
a
distortion
and
a
perversion
of
the
spielberg
doctrine.
but,
focusing
on
spielberg
for
a
moment,
what
we
would
submit
the
board
can
determine
is
that
if
the
discharge
is
for...
if
the
affected
employee
is
contending
that
discharge
is
because
he
is
the
union
organizer
or
he
is
the
union
steward
and
the
employer
is
saying
that
he
is
discharged
for
failure
to
do
his
job
duties
or
to
obey
an
instruction,
then
there
can
be
a
board
review
to
undertake
that
motivational
analysis.
but,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
doing
his
job,
which
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
position
for
the
board
to
make
that
determination.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
concerted
standard
expressly
set
forth
in
section
7
should
be
defined
according
to
its
plain
meaning.
we
believe
this
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
we
also
believe
it
is
consistent
with
this
court's
precedence
defining
the
scope
of
protected
activities
under
section
7
in
other
circumstances
and
the
basic
labor
principle
set
forth
in
those
precedents,
the
labor
principles
of
majortarianism,
of
not
allowing
an
individual
to
control
the
entire
process
and
to
control
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
administration,
the
precedence
of
presumption
of
arbitrability.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
the
act
of
filing
a
grievance?
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
for
filing
a
grievance.
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
we
would
contend
that
the
act
of
filing
a
grievance
is
actual
concerted
activity
between
the
employee--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--that
would
be--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--again,
i
would
say--
mr.
robert
p.
ufer
--i
believe
the
analysis
should
be
an
actual
concerted
analysis
and
if
it
is
found
that
the
conduct
between
the
individual
and
his
union
steward
in
the
filing
of
that
grievance
could
constitute
actual
concerted
activity.
thank
you.
