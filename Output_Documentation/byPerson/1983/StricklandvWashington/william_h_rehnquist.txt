justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
snurkowski,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
have
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case
correct.
the
district,
federal
district
court
granted
habeas
relief
to
the
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
denied
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
judge
vance's
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
eleventh
circuit
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
order
to
be
evaluated
under
the
eleventh
circuit's
standard
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
you
here
are
disagreeing
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
standard
for--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now,
if
we
should
agree
with
your
standard,
and
thereby
disagree
with
the
eleventh
circuit,
might
there
still
not
be
a
necessity
for
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
the
application
of
whatever
standard
that
we
came
up
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
if
a
charged
dereliction
of
counsel
would
have
in
effect
made
no
difference,
you
don't
get
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
in
fact
dereliction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
likely
do
you
think
a
jury
would
have
been
to
buy
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
doubt
that
they
can
be
introduced,
but
i
said
how
likely
do
you
think
a
jury
would
have
been
to
buy
this
analysis
that
you
are
suggesting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
what
if
you
had
had
a
history
of
about
20
cases
identical
to
this
in
florida.
in
every
one
of
them
the
defense
lawyer
did
exactly
what
you
did,
and
in
every
one
of
them
the
jury
had
come
back
saying
no
recommendation
of
mercy.
wouldn't
you
think
that
the
defense
lawyer
on
the
21st
time
might
be
spared
that
job,
and
you
could
say
juries
just
aren't
buying
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
at
least
twice
you
have
said
that
the
gideon
decision
says
that
the
defendant
must
have
adequate
assistance
of
counsel.
i
don't
find
that
language
in
gideon.
all
it
says
is
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
gideon
referred
to
the
term
"adequate
assistance
of
counsel".
