justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
snurkowski,
was
the
florida
trial
court's
determination
that
the
new
evidence
was
insufficient
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
as
a
matter
of
law
a
determination
of
florida
law
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
so
you
think
the
florida
trial
court
determined
as
a
matter
of
florida
law
that
the
new
evidence
could
not
have
overcome
the
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
the
florida
death
statute
could
remove
discretion
from
the
sentencer
and
be
constitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
remove
the
discretion
from
the
sentencer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
would
be
the
effect
of
the
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
then,
to
remove
all
discretion
from
the
trial
court
to
be
able
to
sentence
to
death.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
as
a
matter
of
law
the
new
evidence
could
not
overcome
the
aggravating,
then
aren't
you
saying
that
the
sentencer
must
give
the
death
sentence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
think
the
standard
should
differ
on
direct
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know.
i
am
asking,
though,
if
you
think
there
should
be
a
different
standard
on
direct
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
admission
of
that
evidence
was
improper?
then
what
do
we
have
to
do?
do
we
have
to
see
to
it
that
it's
remanded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
in
that
regard,
do
you
agree
that
counsel
could
have
been
called
at
the
ineffectiveness
hearing
to
testify
what
his
client
told
him
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the
attorney
himself
be
called
at
the
hearing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
ineffectiveness
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
testify
as
to
what
his
client
told
him?
is
there
a
waiver
of
the
attorney-client
privilege?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
evidence
admitted
in
this
case
as
to
why
the
attorney
did
what
he
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
defendant
had
waived
the
jury
here,
had
he
not?
the
defendant
had
waived
the
jury
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
are
just
talking
about
the
judge.
