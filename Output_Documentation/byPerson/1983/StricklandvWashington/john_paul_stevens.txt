justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it
is
right
on
that
point.
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
mixed
petition.
there
was
an
unexhausted
gardner
claim
raised
by
the
petitioner
which
was
not...
never
been
submitted
to
a
state
court.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
claim
was
raised
for
the
first
time
at
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
not
a
gardner
violation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
claim
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
do
you
concede
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
petition
contained
an
unexhausted
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
agree.
i
just
want
to
get
your
position.
it
is
your
position
that
no
unexhausted
claim
was
presented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
had
been
an
unexhausted
claim,
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
something
you
can
waive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
of
florida's
position
is
that
an
unexhausted
claim
does
not
deprive
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
if
the
state
is
willing
to
proceed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
you
haven'
t
addressed
the
question
of
the
trial
judge's
testimony,
which
is
one
of
the
basis
of
reversal.
i
am
wondering,
is
it
the
state's
position
that
if
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner
wants
to
put
the
judge
on
the
stand,
that
he
has
the
right
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
this
time
i
know
the
state
put
the
judge
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
work
both
ways,
or
is
it
your
view
that
only
the
state--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
can
see
the
problem.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
works
both
ways?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
judge
didn't
believe
another
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
have
the
correct
test,
reasonable
competence.
did
this
lawyer
fail
or
pass
that
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
you
would
apply
in
the
constitutional
presentation
of
omitted
evidence
because
counsel
was
incompetent,
as
you
contend
this
counsel
was,
you
would
say
that
that
should
more
readily
result
in
relief
than
just
a
motion
for
new
trial
based
on
evidence
that
could
not
be
obtained,
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
even
though
the
evidence
would
not
suffice
to
support
a
motion
for
new
trial
on
the
ground
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
nevertheless,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
a
new
trial
is
compelled
because
the
lawyer
failed
to
assemble
that
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
assumes
competent
counsel,
but
the
impact
on
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding
is
exactly
the
same
in
the
sense
that
there
is
evidence
omitted,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
different
reason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
are
assuming
a
lawyer
who
was
competent
in
all
other
respects
except
that
he
failed
to
assemble
this
evidence,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
know
what
he
would
have
found
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
dispute,
is
there,
about
what
he
would
have
found
here
with
a
reasonable
investigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
should
there
be
a
greater
chance
for
success
on
collateral
attack
when
the
man
was
represented
by
an
otherwise
competent
counsel
than
if
he
just
couldn't
find
the
evidence?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
the
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
you
would
draw
a
distinction
in
this
case
between
two
lawyers,
one
who
says
what
this
man
said,
that
i
was
so
discouraged
i
didn't
pursue
this
lead,
and
another
lawyer
who
said,
i
didn't
think
it
would
do
any
good
even
if
i
could
have
found
exactly
what
i
now
know
was
available.
they
would
produce
different
results
in
your
constitutional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
he
didn't
assemble
the
evidence
that's
omitted
here.
that's--
