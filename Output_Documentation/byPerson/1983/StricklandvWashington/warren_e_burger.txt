we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
strickland
against
washington.
ms.
snurkowski,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
arel
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
shapiro,
before
you
begin,
may
i
ask
a
question,
more
out
of
curiosity,
i
guess?
is
the
new
jersey
department
of
public
advocate
representing
the
respondent
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
his
behalf?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
case
turn...
to
what
extent,
i
will
put
it
this
way,
does
your
case
turn
on
the
failure
to
call
the
family,
the
former
employers,
and
friends
in
the
mitigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
mitigation,
what
we
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now,
how
should
he
have
demonstrated
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--mr.
shapiro,
that
is
what
my
question
was
directed
to.
it
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
what
justice
white
has
presented.
he
asks
you
what
is
the
standard.
i
put
to
you,
what
is
the
evidence
that
you
think
could
have
been
presented
in
mitigation
that
could
have
made
the
trier
of
the
sentencing
issue
forget
the
grisly,
horrible
slaughtering
of
three
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock.
mr.
shapiro,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
eliminating
perhaps
two-thirds
of
all
the
criminal
cases
that
come
to
trial.
at
least
half.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--couldn't
a
very
experienced
counsel
confronted
with
that
simply
analyze
it
and
say
that
even
if
we
got
the
man's
minister
of
his
church,
his
sunday
school
teacher,
his
boy
scout
leader,
his
mother,
and
his
father,
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
in
view
of
the
grossness
of
the
evidence,
and
make
that
as
a
tactical
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
is
ineffective?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
asking
a
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
lawyers
do
this
all
the
time,
do
they
not?
when
clients
say,
go
do
this,
go
do
that,
lawyers
make
tactical
decisions
based
on
their
own
experience
and
what
has
been
suggested
as
the
value
of
some
undisclosed
piece
of
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
we
know
that
he
didn't
do
that
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
that's--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--we
are
right
where
we
started,
at
least
in
my
hypothetical.
if
he
concludes
that
it
is
hopeless
and
useless
to
put
in
that
evidence,
then
you
would
say
that
he
must
do
it
on
pain
of
being
found
guilty
of
ineffective
assistance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
counsel?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
