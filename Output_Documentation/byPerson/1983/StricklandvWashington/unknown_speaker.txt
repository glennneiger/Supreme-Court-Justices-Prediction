unknown
speaker
you
haven't
listed
the
second
circuit's
approach.
unknown
speaker
can
a
panel
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
shapiro,
i
would
think
that
perhaps
in
a
sentencing
hearing
the
colors
are
a
good
deal
more
blurred
and
the
contours
less
distinct
than
when
you
are
talking
about
proving
the
elements
of
a
crime,
that
counsel's
judgment
in
a
case
like
that
to
do
something
or
not
do
something
should
much
less
readily
be
faulted
than
it
might
be
where
you
are
talking
about
you
could
have
produced
this
witness
that
would
have
definite
negative
element
b
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
also
find
that
this
lack
of
investigation
amounted
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
it
didn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
asked
you
to
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
counsel's
performance
violated
some
standard,
but
isn't
the
fundamental
issue
before
us
what
the
standard
is
for
performance
of
counsel?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
you
are
wrong
on
that?
you
have
to
convince
us
first
about
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
do
you
think
a
different
standard
applies
to
retained
counsel
and
appointed
counsel?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
this
had
been
retained
counsel
and
he
had
made
these
judgments,
you
would
make
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
standard
should
be
different
on
collateral
review
than
direct?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
those
are
the
only
two
alternatives,
the
old
second
circuit
case
and
something
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
shapiro,
the
court
of
appeals
below
didn't
apply
the
standard
that
you
suggest,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
are
you
content
with...
are
you
defending
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
here?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
am
asking
if
you
are
defending
the
standard.
unknown
speaker
please,
mr.
shapiro.
are
you
defending
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals
applied?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
that
is
so,
we
don't
apply
it
here,
do
we?
don't
we
send
it
back
and
tell
them
to
correct
it,
if
we
agree
with
you,
to
apply
the
correct
standard?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
what
we
ought
to
do
then?
unknown
speaker
if
we
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
different...
how
is
that
different,
counsel,
from
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
newly
discovered
evidence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
did
you
cross
petition?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
you
are
attacking
the
standard
the
court
of
appeals
proposed?
unknown
speaker
but
you
want...
but
the
result
of
your
proposal
would
be
a
different
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
if
you
wanted
a
different
judgment,
you
would
have
to
cross
petition.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
would
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
reassess
it.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
has
now
remanded
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
not
to
the
district
court.
