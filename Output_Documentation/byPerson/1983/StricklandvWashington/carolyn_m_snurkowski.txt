ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
eleventh
circuit's
en
banc
decision
setting
forth
the
standards
by
which
prejudice
and
the
competency
level
of
a
defendant
in
a
collateral
action,
the
manner
in
which
that
standard
should
be
applied
is
up
for
consideration.
the
state
is
very
concerned
because
this
particular
case
concerns
three
major
topics
of
interest
to
the
state
of
florida,
and
that
is
that
we
have
a
standard
that
has
been
imposed
by
the
eleventh
circuit
en
banc
which
upends
the
standards
that
the
circuit
courts
have
addressed.
we
have
a
standard
that
says
it
is
in
direct
conflict
and
it
acknowledges
conflict
with
a
d.c.
case,
united
states
versus
decoster.
it
is
also
in
conflict
with
the
florida
supreme
court's
assessment
of
what
the
state
of
florida
will
do
with
regard
to
assessing
competency
of
counsel.
in
that
particular
case,
knight
versus
state,
which
is
cited
in
our
pleadings,
the
florida
supreme
court
meticulously
set
forth
the
standard
for
the
review
of
claims
of
competency
of
counsel
and
relied
on
and
looked
to
with
approval
the
case
of
decoster.
the
third
part
of
this
case
was
actually
the
first
and
second
part,
because
it
has
kind
of
been
meshed.
we
are
concerned
here
also
with
the
scope
that
habeas
corpus
will
take
in
federal
litigation
by
state
prisoners,
because
possibly,
possibly
the
outcome
of
the
eleventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
expanded
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
completely
forget
about
cause,
demonstrate
a
degree
of
prejudice,
not
affecting
the
outcome,
and
open
up
all
claims
that
may
or
may
not
be
cognizable
pursuant
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
it
came
about
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
i
don't
believe
it
was
specifically
initially
addressed
by
the
petitioner
to
the
court.
what
happened,
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings,
there
was
discrepancies
with
regard
to
whether
the
trial
court
and
defense
counsel
had
seen
dr.
jacobson's
psychiatric
evaluation
of
mr.
washington
which
occurred
approximately
october
6th,
so
about
six
days
after
his
arrest--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
but
again,
the
claim
wasn't
per
se
raised.
it
came
about
and
it
was
resolved
through
further
discussions
at
that
proceeding
that
in
fact
there
was
not
a
gardner
violation
because--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--there
was
not...
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
is
correct
with
regard
to--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--the
state
would
contend
that
as
the
posture
of
the
development
of
this
case
developed,
that
in
fact
it
was
a
ruse.
there
was
in
fact
no
unexhausted
claim
before
the
federal
court.
the
fact
that
there
was
discussion
with
regard
to
the
gardner
issue,
that
it
was
resolved,
that
in
fact
that
the
court
did
not
utilize
that
material,
and
defense
counsel's
remarks
with
regard
to
whether
he
had
seen
it
was
unclear.
he
could
not
recall
and
did
not
know.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
state,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
posture
the
case
was
in...
this
case
happened
to
be
under
an
outstanding
death
warrant
in
florida...
the
state
would
have
waived--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have...
there
is
a
case
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit
which
holds
to
the
contrary.
we
have
litigated
that
kind
of
an
issue,
but
the
state
is
of
the
mind
that
you
can
waive
that
issue.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
your
honor.
the
second
point,
as
i
said,
has
to
do
with
habeas
corpus
proceedings
and
the
scope
that
possibly
this
particular
decision
will
have
on
continuing
litigation
in
this
regard.
the
third
part
of
our
complaint
with
the
opinion
is
the
concern,
is
the
concern
the
state
of
florida
has
with
the
integrity
of
the
trial
judges
and
the
florida
supreme
court's
review
of
competency
of
counsel,
the
question
of
whether
the
ultimate
fact
determined
by...
the
ultimate
fact
determined
by
the
florida
supreme
court
should
be
given
some
deference.
here
they
used
a
standard
that
has
not
been
attacked
per
se
as
being
unconstitutional.
the
state
is
contending
that
in
fact
where
a
state
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
particular
instance,
has
reviewed
a
claim
of
competency
of
counsel,
that
standard
is
constitutional
in
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
federal
consideration
of
competency
of
counsel
in
collateral
action
in
federal
court
should
be
limited
to,
first
of
all,
whether
the
standard
is
constitutional.
if
you
get
past
that
point,
whether
in
fact
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
trial
court
in
reviewing
this
initially
has
made
an
assessment,
a
determination
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
sentence
based
on
counsel's
representations
of
the
defendant
at
that
time.
those
are
the
three
main
concerns
we
have
with
this
case.
the
facts
of
the
case
reflect
that
mr.
washington
pled
guilty
to
three
murders.
it
occurred
during
a
crime
spree,
unexplained
crime
spree
that
happened
in
september
of
1976.
the
facts
are
very
clear
in
our
record
with
regard
to
the
murders.
in
fact,
mr.
washington,
without
counsel's
accountenance,
pled
guilty.
first
of
all
he
confessed.
he
pled
guilty
and
he
waived
the
sentencing
proceeding,
which
is
part
of
our
bifurcated
or
trifurcated...
this
is
the
second
part
of
our
trial
at
the
sentencing
phase
in
capital
cases
where
we
have
a
separate
sentencing
jury.
he
waived
all
those
things,
contrary
to
counsel's
advice.
the
defendant's
case
was
affirmed
by
the
florida
supreme
court
on
claims
raised.
he
then
subsequently,
many
years
later,
i
think
in
this
case
four
years
later,
he
went
to
the
trial
court
on
a
3.850
motion
for
collateral
relief,
seeking
relief
because
he
says
now
my
counsel
is
incompetent.
although
i
pled
guilty,
i
have
no
complaints
about
his
preparation
for
trial,
although
i
cut
him
off
at
the
knees
with
regard
to
presenting
my
case
to
a
jury
or
to
a
judge,
he
was
ineffective
at
the
sentencing
phase
because
he
did
not
do
certain
things.
in
particular,
there
were
six,
but
specifically
the
court
has
honed
in
on
the
fact
that
he
did
not
contact
or
call
or
investigate
certain
character
witnesses,
and
that
he
did
not
obtain
information
with
regard
to
mr.
washington's
mental
condition.
he
did
not
obtain
psychiatric
reports.
those
are
the
two
main
claims
that
his
complaint
is
based
on.
he
had
more
than
a
dozen
issues,
but
the
focus
of
all
the
attention
in
all
the
courts
reviewing
this
case
has
been
effectiveness
of
counsel
at
sentencing
with
regard
to
these
particular
claims.
the
trial
court
in
this
particular
case
reviewed
the
claims
said
under
the
knight
standard,
which
requires
that
you
make
a
specific
allegation
as
to
the
competency,
you
make
a
determination
or
you
show...
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
coming
forth
and
demonstrating
that
there
was
some
prejudice,
and
in
this
particular
case
that
would
likely
affect
the
outcome,
and
that
you
demonstrate
that
the
actions
of
counsel
fell
below
that
of
reasonably
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
is
the
knight
standard.
the
trial
court
found
that
in
applying
that
standard
mr.
washington
had
not
met
any
of
the
standards,
that
it
was
summarily
reversible
because
the
14
affidavits
tendered
to
the
court
and
the
two
affidavits
of
psychiatrists
and
a
psychologist
did
not
refute...
first
of
all,
they
only
went
to
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
he
wasn't
complaining
about
the
appropriateness
of
aggravating
circumstances.
he
wasn't
complaining
about
the
appropriateness
of
statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
it
only
went
to
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
the
court
stated
upon
review
of
this
whole
record,
we
find
that
it
does
not
specifically
refute
that
which
counsel
did.
it
did
not
impair
mr.
washington's
ability
to
obtain
a
sentence
of
life
in
this
case.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
believe
it
was.
i
believe
in
assessing...
because
there
we
have
the
trial
court,
who
has
to
be
regulated
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
assessing
the
appropriateness
of
the
death
penalty--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--affected
the
outcome,
modified--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--remove?
i
am
sorry,
i
don't...
repeat
your
question.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
as
opposed...
you
mean--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
don't
believe
that
is...
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
what
we're
doing.
we
are
looking
at
something
as
a
collateral
action
here.
we
are
talking
about
the
sentencer
being
the
trial
judge
who
says...
who
is
the
sentencer
in
florida.
it
is
not
the
jury
in
florida.
they
make
a
recommendation
but
the
trial
court
judge
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
death
should
be
imposed
based
on
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
i
don't
believe
we
are
saying
that.
i
am
saying
we
are
making...
it
is
a
weighing
process.
has
he
come
forward,
has
he
come
forward
and
demonstrated
other
evidence
that...
it's
like
newly
discovered...
that,
as
an
example,
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
used
in
their
particular
pleadings.
i
think
to
bring
it
more
to
home,
into
florida,
it
is
like
quorum
novis,
leave
to
file
error
quorum
novis.
the
defendant
says,
yes,
this
is
all
that
happened
at
trial,
but
i
have
new
evidence,
i
have
other
evidence
that
would
affect
the
outcome,
and
it
was
not
presented
at
this
proceeding.
under
that
requirement,
he
has
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
it
was
through
no
dilatory
actions
of
his
own
that
he
didn't
uncover
it.
certainly
that
would
not
be
a
consideration
in
this
particular
issue,
but
the
second
part
of
that,
would
it
have
affected
the
outcome,
that
is
the
test,
would
it
have
affected
the
outcome.
so
in
fact
you
have
a
sentencer
who
has
made
a
determination.
the
question
now
becomes,
has
there
been
anything
new
introduced
into
this
equation
that
would
require
a
modification
of
that?
in
this
particular
case
the
trial
court
and
the
florida
supreme
court
in
reviewing
this
particular
claim
held
that
beyond
a
moral
certainty
this
factual
recital,
this
new
bit
of
information
would
not
have
changed
the
outcome,
that
in
fact
as
a
matter
of
law
there
were
aggravating
circumstances
that
were
not
challenged,
there
were
no
mitigating...
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
that
the
new
material
did
not
create
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
and
therefore
death
was
appropriate
under
florida
statute.
under
the
authorities
of
florida
cases,
where
you
have
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
no
mitigating
circumstance,
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
again,
the
facts,
as
i
said,
there
was
a
guilty
plea
to
all
these
cases
without
regard
to
what
counsel
was
counseling
mr.
washington
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
washington
did
proceed.
he
now
comes
back
and
complains
about
that
which
has
been
done.
the
district
court
hearing
the
case
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
concluded
that
he
couldn't...
it
was
a
closed
question
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
but
he
ruled
that
there
was
a
need
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
in
fact
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
conducted.
during
the
course
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
on
this
matter,
mr.
tunkey,
who
was
mr.
washington's
counsel,
was
called
to
testify
by
the
defendant.
others
who
were
called
to
testify
were
judge
fuller
and
the
defendant
himself.
the
main
focus,
though,
i
think
is
important
in
this
particular
case
is
what
mr.
tunkey
said,
because
mr.
tunkey
was
now
being
asked
to
tell
the
court,
inform
the
court
what
was
the
purpose,
why
did
you
do
this,
why
did
you
do
that,
did
you
stop,
did
you
stop
your
investigation,
did
you
stop
your
representation
of
this
man
once
you
felt
you
had
this
sunken
feeling
that
because
he
pled
guilty
he
was
not
taking
your
advice?
that
was
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
of
mr.
tunkey.
it
was
not
that
the
florida
supreme
court
or
the
trial
court
had
reviewed
the
facts
in
light
of
the
affidavits
prepared
and
that
in
fact
it
demonstrated
that
there
was
no
entitlement
to
relief,
but
rather
mr.
tunkey,
what
did
you
do
and
why
did
you
do
this?
and
that
is...
past
that
point,
the
trial
court
after
the
evidentiary
hearing
assessed
that
while,
while
we,
after
we
have
asked
him
all
these
questions,
and
because
time
has
dulled
his
memory,
or
because
he
doesn't
want
to
answer
candidly,
because
he
is
in
fact,
he
is
in
fact
being
pitted
against
his
own
client,
or
maybe
because
he
doesn't
know
the
answer,
or
maybe
because
he
doesn't
remember
how
he
reasoned
out
why
he
did
something,
we
have
a
record
that
reflects
mr.
tunkey's
recollections
of
what
occurred.
the
trial,
federal
district
judge
found
that
while
his
judgment
may
not
have
been
correct
in
all
instances,
he
could
not
find
that
prejudice
pursuant
to
decoster,
and
that
is
that
would
likely
affected
the
outcome,
had
occurred,
and
therefore
he
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
matter
was
taken
by
the
eleventh
circuit
on
direct
appeal,
and
the
en
banc
court,
after
a
panel
decision,
concluded
the
standard
to
be...
could,
with
regard
to
the
prejudice
aspect
could
be
things
that...
could
it
have
been
helpful,
that
was
the
term,
helpful
to
the
defense.
that
was
the
standard
of
prejudice.
the
defendant
only
had
to
come
forward
and
say,
i
am
showing
you
that
these
things
could
have
been
helpful
to
my
defense.
the
en
banc
panel
rejected
helpfulness,
and
in
lieu
of
that
substituted
that
under
fradey
there
was
a
likelihood
or
not
likelihood,
that
substantial
and
actual
prejudice
occurred
that
would
have
been
a
disadvantage
to
the
defense.
the
state
would
contend
that
one
of
the
more...
perhaps
not...
that
is
a
very
important
issue,
but
the
more
important
issue
in
this
is
also
how
the
court
viewed
what
we
must
do,
and
that
is
what
i
first
started
this
argument
about,
how
we
have
turned
upside-down
the
claim
here.
the
eleventh
circuit
suggested
that
because
the
district
judge
did
not
make
a
finding
with
regard
to
ineffectiveness
of
counsel,
because
he
didn't
do
that,
it
had
to
be
sent
back.
it
was
not
sufficient
that
he
made
an
assessment
that
there
may
have
been
errors
in
judgment,
but
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
the
state
would
contend
that
is
the
very
means
by
which
you
go
about
judging
collateral
issues.
you
make
an
assessment
based
on
the
allegations
raised
and
the
evidence
presented.
in
this
particular
case,
in
the
federal
court,
the
state,
the
state
produced
all
of
the
defendant's
affidavits.
when
he
came
forth
in
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
filed
a
bare
bones
petition,
and
it
was
the
state
in
their
response
that
included
the
record,
which
was
their
responsibility,
but
also
included
the
affidavits
which
the
defendant
had
relied
on
in
the
state
trial
court.
this
is
kind
of
the
reverse
of
the
weak
case,
strong
case
theory
of
going
weak
case
in
state
court,
strong
case
in
federal
court.
we
had
a
strong
case
in
the
state
court
and
we
had
a
weak
case
or
a
minimal
case
in
federal
court.
but
the
point
is
that
getting
back
to
what
the
court
found,
the
court
said,
okay,
there
may
have
been
problems,
he
may
not
have
used
the
best
judgment,
but
there
was
no
prejudice
demonstrated,
and
that
is
the
focal
point
of
habeas
corpus.
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
fairness,
whether
there
has
been
miscarriage
of
justice
here,
not
whether
mr.
tunkey
should
be
crucified,
and
then
after
he
has
been
crucified,
we
say,
well,
yes,
you
know,
he
was
a
nice
guy,
but
you
know,
actually,
looking
at
the
record
and
seeing
what
he
did,
it
really
wasn't
so
bad,
was
it?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
probably
didn't
reduce
itself
to
prejudice
to
this
particular
defendant,
whether
you
base
it
on
the
standard
that
the
eleventh
circuit
has
imposed
or
you
base
it
on
the
standard
that
the
state
suggests
is
the
proper
standard
for
prejudice,
and
that
is
that
it
has
a
likely
effect
on
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings.
to
give
full
credit
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
i
might
add
that
although
in
suggesting
that
first
we
crucify
mr.
tunkey
and
then
we
consider
whether
prejudice
has
obtained,
they
did
set
out
in
footnote
33
of
the
majority
opinion
that
there
may
be
instances
when
this
kind
of
procedure
could
be
changed,
that
in
fact
you
might
look
to
the
prejudice
aspect
first
rather
than
reviewing
whether
counsel
had
rendered
effective
assistance
of
counsel
or
counsel's
representation
fell
below
a
certain
standard.
however,
in
this
particular
case
they
said,
no,
no,
we
find
that
in
this
case
you
have
to
make
an
assessment
with
regard
to
what
mr.
tunkey
did
and
then,
and
then,
although
the
court
has
already
found
that
we
do
not
disagree
with
that
because
possibly
there
could
have
been
an
opportunity
or
there
was
a
reason
for
this,
there
may
have
been,
very
well
been
tactical
reasons
for
the
way
he
proceeded.
in
spite
of
all
that,
in
spite
of
the
fact
there
was
no
prejudice,
then
you
come
back,
and
we
will
see
what
you've
done.
but
first
of
all
go
back
and
talk
about
mr.
tunkey
and
whether
he
in
fact
represented
mr.
washington
well.
as
justice
o'connor
asked
the
solicitor
general
in
the
first
case,
this
is
a
b
case,
not
an
a
case,
based
on
your
question.
certainly
the
two
elements
that
we
need
to
review
is
whether
in
fact
prejudice
has
occurred
and
to
what
degree.
the
circuits
throughout
this
state
or
this
country
have
utilized
the
mcmahon
rule
or
the
mcmahon
statement,
and
in
13
years
have
developed
all
sorts
of
degrees
of
prejudice,
degrees
or
standards
to
be
applied,
and
that
is
what
is
so
important
today,
is
that
we
have
some
feeling
for
what
kind
of
degree.
while
the
respondents
have
conceded
in
their
pleadings
that
in
fact
the
defendant
does
have
a
burden
to
show
prejudice,
they
would
take
issue
certainly
with
the
degree
of
prejudice
the
state
would
contend
is
necessary
in
this
particular
case.
they
are
opting,
i
might
add,
for
the
panel
decision,
not
the
en
banc
decision
in
this
particular
case,
although
there
have
been
no
cross
pleadings
filed
that
i
know
of.
the
state
would
contend
that
the
only
way,
the
only
way
that
we
can
resolve
the
kinds
of
problems
that
exist
in
habeas
corpus,
in
collateral
litigation
from
state
prisoners,
and
in
fact,
in
fact,
federal
prisoners
under
2255,
is
to
determine
that
the
prejudice
that
is
to...
the
burden
of
prejudice
the
defendant
must
reach
goes
to
a
likelihood
of
affecting
the
outcome.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
on
direct
review?
certainly
i
believe
that
there
should
be
some
demonstration
of
prejudice,
whether
in
fact
we
are
going
to
have
a
differing
scale
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proceedings.
i
might
add,
fortunately
this
case
is
not
of
that
ilk,
and
the
first
case
was.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes,
i
probably
would,
only
to
the
extent
that
collateral
litigation...
we
have
had
a
hallmark
of
what
collateral
litigation
is
to
do
as
opposed...
you
know,
we
are
going
to
be
truth
finding.
we
are
looking
at
the...
we
have
an
otherwise
valid
judgment
and
sentence
that
is
now
later
being
attacked.
now,
while
it
is
true
that
in
the
direct
appeal
he
is
attacking
an
otherwise
valid
judgment
and
sentence,
it
hasn't
been
given
the
imprimatur
of
an
appellate
court
to
say
yes,
that
particular
judgment
and
sentence
has
been
approved,
but
the
standard
in
a
sense
should
not
be
that
far
off.
it
may
be
the
agres
standard,
where
there
is
something
just
quite...
a
little
less
than
showing
the
likelihood
that
it
would
affect
the
outcome.
perhaps
it
could
be
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
raised
that
wasn't
there
otherwise.
but
again,
that
is
not
an
issue
that
we
have
come
forward
with,
because
it
is
not
the
normal
kind
of
issue
that
we
have...
we
are
faced
on
a
given
day
to
day
basis,
and
we
are
very
concerned
again
with
the
collateral
type
prejudice
that
should
be
pronounced
with
regard
to
the
standard
to
be
pronounced.
the
second
part
of
this,
of
course,
is
also,
and
it
is
important
in
this
case,
although
it
is
not
as
precious
to
the
state,
and
that
is
the
standard
with
regard
to
how
we
determine
competency
of
counsel.
what
is
the
standard?
what
will
counsel
do?
i
think
if
you
look
through,
look
through
what
the
circuits
have
done
based
on
mcmahon,
we
have
"reasonable,
competent
assistant",
"customary
skill
and
knowledge",
"normal
competency",
"reasonable
effective
assistance",
"minimal
standard
of
professional
representation",
"customary
skills
and
diligence",
"exercise
skill,
judgment,
and
diligence
of
reasonable
competent
defense
counsel.
"
and
"reasonably
likely
to
render
and
reasonably
rendering
effective
assistance.
"
we
have
a
whole
host--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
that,
i
was
told
that
recently
it
is
a
farce
mockery.
they
still
adhere
to
the
farce
mockery,
but
apparently
a
case
mid-december
came
out
where
a
panel,
i
think
the
case
is
trammel
versus
united
states,
where
they
said
that
they
would
no
longer
adhere
to
the
farce
mockery,
and
would
in
fact
accede
to
a
reasonable
likely
or
reasonably
likely
to
render
effective--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
believe
in
that
particular
case
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
or
in
the
vote
that
they
polled
the
whole
court
in
that
particular
case,
but
i
would
disagree.
again,
a
panel
might
not
be
able
to
do
that.
in
that
particular
case,
that's
what
happened.
the
state
would
contend
that
while
i
have
no
panacea,
i
can't
give
you
the
answer
to
what
is
the
standard
to
be
applied,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are,
there
are
standards
or
there
are
better
language
or
better
words
to
be
applied.
we
are
not
locking
to
the
name
we
give
something,
but
what
in
fact
counsel
does,
and
the
state
would
submit
that
whether
counsel's
acts
or
omissions
result
in
egregious
error
which
infected
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
system
is
probably
more
in
line
with
how
we
are
going
to
assess
counsel's
representation.
we
are
going
to
look
for
an
outcome-oriented
test
to
be
applied.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
federal
district
court,
no,
denied--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--habeas
corpus.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
remanded
it,
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
your
honor,
as
i
am
suggesting,
the
standard
to
be
imposed
or
the
manner
by
which
you
view
the
case
or
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
first
to
look
to
whether
the
allegations
presented
in
fact
result
in
prejudice.
if
no
prejudice
has
occurred,
the
second
step
in
making
a
determination
as
to
what
counsel
did
and
why
he
did
it
is
of
no
consequence.
there
is
no
point
in
finding
out
why
bill
tunkey
did
something
if
you
say
the
14
affidavits
that
now
are
being
presented
would
not
have
affected
the
outcome,
would
not
have
changed,
had
no
effect
on
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
to
what
degree.
right,
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
habeas
petitioner?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
right,
that's
true.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
it
probably
does,
but
i
would
suspect
that
there's,
you
know,
there's
a
problem,
certainly
there's
a
problem
with
that,
in
that
if
the--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
i
think
there's
a
viable--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--certainly.
it's
not
a
one-way
street.
but
i
might
add
in
this
particular
case
that
the
federal
district
court
indicated
in
his
opinion
that
the
statements,
while
they
were
admissible,
and
there
wasn't
a
complaint
with
regard
to
them,
while
he
found
them
admissible,
he
gave
very
little
credibility
to
those
particular
statements,
and
he
said
they
were
not
a
determinative
factor
in
determining
the
outcome
of
this
particular
result.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
don't
think
it
was...
he
just
didn't
want
to
give
it
a
lot
of
weight
in
that
particular
regard.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
required
in
this
particular
instance.
i
think
then
you
can
again
look
to
the...
while
you
say
there
is
admission
of
evidence
of
error,
is
this
the
kind
of
admission
of
evidence
that
is
so
egregious
that
it
affected
the
trial
judge's
or
in
this
particular
case
the
district
court
judge's
assessment
of
the
case,
and
i
think
that
is
a
kind
of
assessment
you
can
make
because
you
have
a
record.
it
doesn't
require
further
evidentiary
considerations
outside
the
record
itself.
i
think
this
court
can
make
a
finding
that
in
fact
while
it
might
have
been
error
to
have
done
that,
and
the
state
is
not
willing
to
concede
that,
but
while
it
might
have
been,
it
does
not
require
remand
to
the
eleventh
circuit
or
to
the
district
court
judge.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
just
have...
oh,
thank
you.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
state
would
contend
that
the
assessment
here
that
there
was
a
failure
to
investigate
or
produce
witnesses,
that
is
a
limited
review
of
what
investigation
is
supposed
to
be.
if
you
look
at
this
record,
you
will
find
that
mr.
tunkey
did
on
numerous
occasions
talk
with
mr.
washington
with
regard
to
the
case.
he
did
discuss,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
close
of
the
state's
case,
at
the
proceeding,
the
sentencing
proceeding,
mr.
tunkey
and
mr.
washington
spoke
with
regard
to
what
evidence
should
be
presented.
at
that
point
the
court
asked,
well,
are
you
going
to
present
any
evidence?
he
said,
no,
your
honor.
and
then
he
proceeded
to
go
through
why
certain
aggravating
circumstances
were
appropriate,
why
certain
mitigating
circumstances
may
or
may
not
be
appropriate,
through
what
he
had
produced
in
his
sentencing
brief.
and
i
might
add,
we
need
to
look
not
just
at
what
the
allegation
is,
but
what
the
man
did,
what
mr.
tunkey
did
in
behalf
of
mr.
washington
with
regard
to
sentencing.
the
record
reflects
that
he
produced
a
sentencing
brief
which
detailed
those
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
and
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
which
mr.
tunkey
felt
were
appropriate
in
his
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
went
so
far
to
suggest
that
remorse,
the
fact
that
mr.
washington
pled
guilty,
that
he
cooperated,
those
were
all
non-statutory
mitigating
factors
that
the
court
should
consider.
he
also
argued
vehemently
with
regard
to
what
aggravating
circumstances
should
not
be
applicable,
and
indeed
he,
prior
to
the
sentencing
proceeding,
was
able
to
get
a
rap
sheet
of
mr.
washington's
excluded.
he
was
also
instrumental
in
getting
the
trial
court
to
not
consider
one
aggravating
circumstance
which
would
have
been
appropriately
applied
in
this
particular
case.
he
convinced
them
of
that.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
was
it.
that
was
quick.
thank
you.
