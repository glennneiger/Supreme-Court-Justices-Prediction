mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
the
public
defender
of
new
jersey
is
my
boss,
and
i
was
handling
this
case
when
i
was
in
the
south
representing
people
in
death
row
cases,
and
when
i
came
to
the
office,
because
of
its
importance
to
new
jersey's
new
capital
sentencing
law
and
to
standards
for
effective
assistance
of
counsel
nationwide,
the
new
jersey
public
defender
allowed
me
to
present
the
case
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
discussing
the
legal
standard
for
assessing
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
it
is
essential
to
point
out
what
the
district
court
found
as
the
reason
for
counsel's
lack
of
investigation.
the
record
shows
that
any
assertion
that
counsel
made
a
tactical
or
strategic
reason
not
to
investigate
is
flatly
contradicted.
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
had
an
opportunity
to
hear
from
counsel,
to
evaluate
his
credibility,
and
to
hear
his
reasons
for
what
he
did
and
did
not
do.
the
district
court
evaluated
this,
the
credibility
of
mr.
tunkey,
and
made
several
critical
findings.
these
findings
reject
any
assertion
of
a
strategic
or
tactical
choice
for
lack
of
investigation.
in
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
at
page
264,
the
district
court
finds
that
mr.
tunkey
testified
to
his
feeling
of
hopelessness
upon
learning
of
the
new
murder
confessions.
at
page
282,
the
district
court
finds
as
a
fact
that
mr.
tunkey
candidly
admitted
that
once
the
multiple
confessions
were
given,
he
had
a
feeling
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
save
washington,
and
that
this
feeling
was
behind
his
failure
to
do
an
independent
investigation
on
petitioner's
background
and
potentially
mitigating
emotional
and
mental
reasons
for
the
killings.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes,
there
is
a
waiver
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
in
those
circumstances.
the
record
is
no
doubt--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
turnkey
testified
at
the
district
court
hearing,
and
the
record
of
that
hearing
and
the
findings
of
the
district
court
leave
no
doubt
that
any
argument
that
there
was
a
strategic
or
tactical
choice
for
this
total
lack
of
investigation
is
without
merit.
the
state
never
cross
appealed
these
factual
findings.
there
is
no
demonstration
that
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
it
turns
on
two
things,
your
honor.
it
turns
on
the
fact
that
counsel...
it
turns
on
one
essential
overarching
principle
and
two
supporting
factual
assumptions.
the
overarching
principle
is
that
counsel's
lack
of
investigation
left
him
utterly
unprepared
to
present
essential
factual
support
for
his
arguments
that
david
washington's
life
should
be
spared.
at
the
sentencing
hearing--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
the
mitigation
hearing.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
mr.
tunkey
argued
at
page
322
of
the
joint
appendix
that
david
washington
"possesses
a
spark
within
him
which
is
good,
which
is
decent.
"
yet
he
could
not
point
and
did
not
point
when
his
client's
life
was
at
stake
to
a
single
shred
of
independent
evidence
that
would
have
advised
the
judge
of
a
fuller
understanding
of
who
david
washington
is.
who
is
this
individual
who
has
a
spark
of
decency
within
him?
he
did
not
point
to
anything
within
him,
your
honor,
but
just
made
that
bald
assertion.
david--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--that
might
be
in
a
case,
your
honor,
where
counsel
exercises
that
judgment,
and
where
that
is
indicated
by
the
record,
but
in
this
case,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
the
district
court
found
that
the
lack
of
investigation
and
consequently
the
inability
to
present
mitigating
evidence
was
due
to
counsel's
sense
of
hopelessness
and
a
lack
of
investigation.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
the
district
court
did
not
make
that
specific
finding--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--but
we
submit
that
under
pullman--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
and
under
pullman
standard
versus
swint,
the
record
leaves
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
basic
defect
in
counsel's
performance.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
consider
first
of
all
that
mr.
tunkey
advanced
certain
positions
at
the
sentencing
phase
and
was
unable
to
present
the
evidence
that
would
support
those
positions,
because
the
basic
difference
between
the
state
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
proper
standard
of
prejudice
focuses
on
impairment
to
the
defense
and
not
just
on
the
effect
on
outcome.
to
get...
to
demonstrate--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
beyond
the
record
demonstrating
that
counsel
failed
to
present
the
evidence
that
would
have
supported
his
sentencing
argument,
the
record
also
demonstrates
that
counsel
failed
to
fulfill
the
basic
responsibilities
of
an
advocate,
and
this
substantially
undermined
his
ability
to
present
his
case
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
now,
the--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--your
honor,
under
florida
law,
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
have
often
made
a
difference
between
life
and
death,
evidence
of
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances.
had
mr.
tunkey
conducted
an
investigation,
he
could
have
supported
two
premises
in
his
argument
for
david
washington's
life,
which
he
did
try
to
advance.
one
was
that
david
washington
had
a
spark
within
him
which
was
good,
which
was
decent.
another
was,
in
his
argument,
counsel
states
that
no
one
understands
why
mr.
washington
might
have
done
what
he
did
or
did
what
he
did,
and
yet
there
was
evidence
of...
psychiatric
and
psychological
evidence
that
could
have
been
available
to
him
upon
reasonable
investigation,
that
would
have
established
that
the
combination
of
child
abuse,
deprivation,
and
neglect
as
a
youth
combined
with
the
extraordinary
pressures
that
were
placed
on
mr.
washington
at
the
time
of
the
crimes
led
to
the
severe
mental
and
emotional
distress
which
resulted
in
his
breakdown
during
that
period
of
time.
this
is
precisely--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
we
can
only
go
by
what
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
is
the
appropriate
law
in
these
cases,
and
by
what
this
court
has
said
the
florida
supreme
court
process
is.
for
one,
the
florida
supreme
court
has
stated
in
numerous
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
that
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
can
make
a
difference
between
life
and
death.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
the
florida--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--i
think,
your
honor,
if
sentencing...
sentencing
in
capital
cases
is
what
this
court
has
stated,
and
that
is
a
series
of
judgmental
factors,
a
myriad
of
factors
that
are
responsive
to
the
particular
individual
circumstances
of
the
defendant
and
of
the
offense,
then
we
can't
know
that
unless
we
speculate.
we
do
know
that
a
witness--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--your
honor,
i
think
that
if
he
did
do
that
as
a
tactical
choice,
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
in
this
case,
mr.
tunkey
made
those
precise
non-statutory
mitigating
arguments.
what
he
didn't
do
was
present
the
factual
predicate
for
arguments
that
he
was
asserting
the
sentencing
judge
should
have
bought.
he
was
saying
to
the
judge,
these
are
the
reasons
why
david
washington's
life
should
be
spared.
he
wasn't
providing
the
judge
with
the
facts,
though,
and
the
facts
are
what
make
the
difference.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
he
had
presented
these
facts
to
the
judge,
and
he
was
telling
the
judge,
these
are
why
david
washington's
life,
these
are
the
reasons
why
his
life
should
be
spared,
but
he
presented
none
of
the
factual
predicate.
it
is
like
getting
up
in
front
of
the
judge
and
saying,
not
guilty,
not
guilty,
not
putting
on
any
evidence,
and
then
coming
back
and
saying,
well,
there
was
an
alibi.
he
is
asking
the
sentencer
to
buy
an
argument
or
the
jury
to
buy
an
argument
without
presenting
the
factual
predicate.
that
is
the
defect.
now,
any
standard
to
consider
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
these
kinds
of
circumstances
must
take
into
account
the
values
that
this
court
has
established
in
sixth
amendment
cases.
first,
the
standard
must
preserve
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
our
system
of
justice.
second,
the
standard,
if
it
is
going
to
work
in
the
myriad
of
situations
that
courts
are
faced
with,
must
provide
clear
guidelines
and
criteria
for
its
application
in
what
is
essentially
case
by
case
adjudication.
and
third,
the
standard
must
accommodate
society's
interests
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
in
the
finality
of
judgments.
under
any
or
all
of
these
factors,
we
suggest
that
a
test
focusing
on
the
impairment
of
the
defense,
the
adverse
effect
on
the
defense,
and
not
on
the
outcome,
is
far
superior.
first
of
all,
the
outcome
determinative
test
does
not
preserve
the
fundamental
value
of
the
sixth
amendment.
it
simply
doesn't.
it
shifts
the
focus
away
from
the
adequacy
of
counsel's
performance
towards
an
almost
exclusive
concentration
on
the
trial
result.
it
is
a
reversal,
and
has
to
be
faced
as
a
reversal
of
developments
in
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
since
gideon.
rather
than
adequate
legal
assistance
being
essential
or
critical
as
a
requirement
for
a
fair
trial,
the
outcome
determinative
test
assumes
the
defendant
could
have
a
fair
trial
with
incompetent
counsel.
this
is
betts
v.
brady
in
another
guise.
and
frankly,
i
don't
see
the
difference,
your
honor,
between
adopting
an
outcome
determinative
test
in
this
situation
and
if
a
judge
and
prosecutor
get
together
before
a
case
and
say
to
the
defendant,
listen,
we
have
looked
at
the
case,
the
evidence
is
against
you,
you
are
not
going
to
win
this
anyway,
so
we
don't
even
have
to
bother
to
appoint
counsel.
the
same
principle
is
equally
relevant
if
you
are
going
to
start
looking
at
outcome.
if
substance
of
counsel
is
deprived
and
removed
from
the
case,
then
the
form
of
counsel
is
meaningless.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
think
cairo
makes
that
clear,
that
the
same
standard
should
apply.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
if
he
made
the
judgments
without
the
essential
factual
predicates,
without
conducting
the
essential...
without
performing
the
basic
attributes
of
counsel,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
constitution
says
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
and
this
court
has
said
that
that
includes
the
effective
assistance,
and
in
fact,
our
test
at
all
stages
of
the
proceeding
would
balance
society,
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
and
society's
interest
in
finality
of
judgments.
so
there
would
be
no
need
to
shift
the
standards
back
and
forth.
for
example,
under
our
test,
first
of
all,
or
the
test
proposed
in
our
brief,
first
of
all,
the
petitioner,
the
defendant,
would
have
to
show
a
serious
error.
secondly,
even
if
he
shows
a
basic
failing
of
counsel,
what
is
essentially
removal
of
a
basic
attribute
of
assistance
from
his
trial,
he
would
have
to
show
that
that
impaired
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
now,
by
showing
the
impairment
in
the
presentation
of
the
defense,
we
are
first
of
all
focusing
on
outcome
in
this
standard.
it
is
the
first
glimpse
of
outcome,
and
the
test
really
says
that
the
integrity
of
the
adversary
process
must
be
preserved
and
can
only
be
preserved
by
competent
counsel,
but
if
in
that
case
there
was
no
effect
or
adverse
effect
on
the
defense,
the
adversary
system
functioned.
it
may
have
had
a
few
warts,
in
that
counsel
didn't
do--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
basic
principles
in
this
court's
sixth
amendment
decisions
that
must
be
considered
in
deciding
whether
to
adopt
a
standard
of
prejudice
that
assesses...
that
focuses
on
the
effect
on
outcome
or
one
that
focuses
on
the
effect
on
the
defense.
first,
the
standard
must
preserve
the
fundamental
nature
of
counsel
in
our
system
of
justice.
second,
the
standard
should
provide
guidelines
for
the
lower
courts
to
apply
the
sixth
amendment
in
a
variety
of
situations.
and
third,
as
united
states
versus
morrison
points
out,
in
the
sixth
amendment
area,
the
standard
should
accommodate
society's
interest
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
finality
of
judgments.
i
have
already
explained
why
the
outcome
determinative
test
is
an
utter
failure
in
preserving
any
sense
of
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
right
to
counsel.
in
contrast,
a
standard
that
looks
at
the
effect
on
the
defense
breathes
much
needed
substance
into
the
formal
right
of
counsel.
this
is
not
a
question
of
undermining
the
adversary
system
by
questioning
counsel's
adequacy.
it
is
a
matter
of
preserving
an
adversary
system
that
assumes
competent
counsel,
and
that
assumes
and
indeed
requires
competent
counsel.
secondly,
the
outcome
determinative
concentration
on
result
will
not
provide
any
guidelines
for
the
lower
courts
in
sixth
amendment
analysis.
it
is
uniquely
unsuited
to
develop
a
body
of
precedent
that
is
so
necessary
to
develop
standards
as
to
the
adequacy
of
counsel's
performance.
in
fact,
the
outcome
determinative
test
brings
the
court
full
circle
into
the
subjective
morass
of
the
farce
and
mockery
standard,
and
it
would
be
ironic
and
it
is
ironic
for
petitioners
to
argue
three
weeks
after
the
last
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
in
trapnel
versus
united
states,
rejected
in
an
en
banc
form,
although
it
was
a
panel
decision,
the
farce
and
mockery
standard,
for
the
petitioners
to
argue
that
this
court
should
resurrect
what
is
nothing
less
than
an
artifact
of
that
outmoded
standard.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
competency
of
counsel,
every
circuit
in
the
country
now
has
rejected
farce
and
mockery
for
a
standard
that
focuses
on
the
reasonably
competent...
whether
counsel
was
reasonably
competent
suggests
that
the
experience...
this
is
an
area,
as
the
court
well
knows,
where
the
circuits
are...
have
uniquely
dealt
with
most
of
the
cases,
most
of
the
problems,
and
have
really
functioned
as
laboratories
for
a
long
period
of
time
in
dealing
with
questions
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
every
circuit
in
experimenting
with
different
standards
and
looking
at
different
tests
has
ended
up
now--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
in
three
basic
respects
mr.
tunkey
did
not
satisfy
that
test.
first
of
all,
a
counsel
laboring
under
a
sense
of
hopelessness,
as
mr.
tunkey
was,
is
not
the
zealous
advocate
that
the
constitution
requires
and
that
the
sacred
professional
trust
of
an
attorney
requires.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor...
well,
a
counsel
laboring
under
a
sense
of
hopelessness
is,
if
he
fails
then
as
a
result
of
that,
he
fails
to
conduct
any
investigation
into
critical
information
that
is
necessary
for
that
particular
case,
he
is
totally
incapable
at
that
point
of
either
presenting
a
case
or
of
adequately
advising
his
client.
mr.
tunkey
had...
mr.
washington
was
deprived
of
all
the
essential
attributes
of
counsel,
and
we
suggest
that
under
the
reasonably
competent
standard,
this
is
far
below
what
the
range
of
competence
demanded--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--it
applied
the
reasonable
competency
standard,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
with
respect
to
assessing
the
standard
of
prejudice...
with
respect
to
assessing
counsel's
performance.
with
respect
to
the
standard
of
prejudice,
it
applied
a
test
that
it
extrapolated
from
united
states
versus
fradey,
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
the
principles
in
procedural
default
cases
are
inapplicable
when
assessing
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
are
defending
the
result.
the
result--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--we
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
focus
on
the
adequacy
of
counsel's
performance
as
the
relevant--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--we
would
suggest
that
the
legal
standard
should
be
modified.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
you--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--well,
if
you
agree
with
me,
you
will
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
application
of
the
correct
standard.
yes,
your
honor.
the
outcome
determinative
test
not
only
resurrects
farce
and
mockery,
but
it
compounds
the
farce
and
mockery
problems
by
forcing
courts
to
engage
in
speculative
recreations
and
revisions
of
trial
records
to
determine
what
the
hypothetical
result
would
be
of
the
new
procedure.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
it
is
different
in
two
basic
respects,
your
honor.
one
is
that
the
motion
for
new
trial
is
not
a
motion
that
attacks
or
deals
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
so
that's...
second
is
that
a
motion
for
new
trial
assumes
that
the
defendant
had
a
fair
trial,
competent
counsel.
then
what
it
does
on
the
basis
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
it
says
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
judgment,
something
wrong
with
the
integrity
of
the
verdict,
and
in
that
case
the
focus
should
be
directly
on
the
integrity,
whether
the
new
evidence
would
have
changed
the
verdict.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
this
court
has
already
said
in
gideon
you
can't
have
a
fair
trial
without
adequate
counsel.
so
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
ignores
the
major
premise
of
gideon...
the
motion
for
new
trial
analogy
of
the
solicitor
general
ignores
the
major
premise,
the
major
constitutional
premise
of
gideon--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes.
if
the--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
your
honor.
i
suggest
we
are
dealing
with
apples
and
oranges.
a
motion
for
new
trial
assumes
the
very
facts
that
are
in
issue.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
the
evidence
was
omitted,
but
the--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--the
evidence
was
omitted.
by
the
admission
of
that
evidence,
the
entire
basis
of
this
court's
sixth
amendment
decisions
has
been
undermined.
there
has
been
a
flaw
in
the
adversary
system,
and
there
has
been
a--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--well,
and
we
are
also
assuming
that
you
have
to
speculate
about
how
the
failure
to
investigate,
not
the
failure
to
discover,
because
if
counsel
conducts
a
reasonable
investigation,
there
is
no
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
it
is
only
when
he
fails
to--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--conduct--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
for
one,
your
honor,
it
is
because
the
failures
of
counsel
bring
into
question
the
integrity
of
the
entire
judgment
in
the
same
way,
and
that
is
the
teaching
of
gideon,
the
teaching
of
gideon
that
you
don't
have
a
fair
trial
without
adequate
counsel,
in
the
same
way
that
the
lack
of
the
newly
discovered
evidence
called
into
question
the
integrity
of
the
final
judgment.
the
analogy
is
a
pure
analogy.
you
can't
have
a
fair,
fundamentally
fair
judgment
without
adequate
counsel.
the
second
respect
is
that
the
test
that
we
propose
and
the
test
in
the
court
of
appeals
would
ensure
that
even
if
there
was
no,
if
there
was
absolutely
no
effect
on
the
outcome,
that
is,
the
state
could
demonstrate
that
the
undiscovered
evidence
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
defendant
would
not
be
entitled
to
relief.
it
preserves--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
attorneys...
if
the
attorney
did
not
conduct
a
reasonable
investigation,
there
would
be
a
difference
between
an
attorney
who
conducted--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
if
he
conducted
a
reasonable
investigation
and
did
not
assemble
this
evidence,
that
would
be
something
different
than
if
counsel
conducted...
failed
to...
if
counsel
conducted
a
reasonable
investigation
and
made
strategic
or
tactical
decisions,
and
that
is
because
the
counsel
in
the
second
situation
has
fulfilled
the
essential
attribute
of
an
attorney.
he
has
conducted
the
investigation
and
made
decisions
predicated
on
that
investigation.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
for
one,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--for
one,
your
honor,
that
is
not
what
this
mr.
tunkey
did.
and
secondly--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--secondly,
your
honor,
i
would
say
if
he
did
not
conduct
any
investigation,
any
reasonable
investigation
into
the
evidence
that
is
critical
to
a
capital
sentencing
decision,
then
i
think
he
is
in
no
position
to
make
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
are
appropriate
for
what
evidence
to
present
and
what
evidence
not
to
present.
it
is
a
basic
failing
of
counsel
that
is
clear
in
this
court's
sixth
amendment
decisions.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
well,
if
they
exercise
sound
professional
judgment
in
making
that
decision,
then,
your
honor,
it
is
not
incompetent
assistance.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
because
he
said
the
reason
the
district
court
found
as
a
reason
for
his
failure
to
conduct
an
investigation
was
a
sense
of
hopelessness.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
not--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--your
honor,
that
is
not
what
mr.
tunkey
did.
he
failed
to
conduct
an
investigation
out
of
a
sense
of
hopelessness.
but
in
his
closing
argument
he
tried
to
make
the
very
points
that
his
investigation
would
have
allowed
him
to
factually
support,
finally--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--it
says,
your
honor,
in
gideon,
it
says
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
fundamental
to
a
fair
trial.
in
cairo
versus--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor.
if
i
said
that,
i
misspoke,
but
in
cairo
versus
sullivan,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
states
are
precluded
from
conducting
trials
without
adequate
legal
assistance.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
are
saying,
stating
that
the
legal
standard
was
incorrect.
we
agree
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
rejected
an
outcome
determinative
standard
and
adopted
the
standard
that
focuses--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--your
honor,
well,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
same
judgment--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
be
a
different
judgment,
because
the
case
would
still
have
to--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--the
case
would
still
have
to
be--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--the
case
would
still
have
to
be
remanded,
your
honor,
under
our
test
because--
mr.
richard
e.
shapiro
--yes,
it
would,
your
honor,
because
there
has
been
no
determination
of
whether
the
counsel's
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
the
third
feature
of
our
test,
and
which
also
is
the
way
in
which
our
test
accommodates
society's
interest
in
finality
in
the
same
way
and
in
a
much
more
compelling
way
it
accommodates
the
sixth
amendment
right
and
society's
interest
in
finality
by
focusing
on
outcome
at
the
appropriate
stage
in
the
analysis,
when
requiring
the
prosecution
to
establish
that
the
result
would
not
have
been
different
beyond
a...
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
state's
test
does
not
accommodate
at
all.
what
it
does
is,
it
establishes
that
no
matter
how
severely
defense
counsel
impaired
the
defense,
how
incompetent
counsel
was,
there
is
no
relief
under
the
sixth
amendment
if
the
result
would
not
have
been
different.
this
is
not
an
accommodation
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
goal
of
finality.
it
is
an
utter
disregard
for
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
sixth
amendment.
in
contrast,
the
test
that
we
have
suggested
is
rigorous,
it
has
functioned
well
in
the
circuits,
it
has
been
adopted
by
virtually...
by
every
circuit
except
the
d.
c.
circuit
as
a
way
of
assessing
prejudice
or
focus
on
counsel's
performance,
and
it
has
been
applied
with
rigor.
there
are
few
cases
where
counsel's
performance
has
resulted
in
the
reversal
of
conviction,
and
there
has
been
no
indication
in
the
circuits
that
they
should
abandon
such
a
focus
on
the
impairment
of
the
defense
because
of
any
problems
they
are
experiencing
with
the
standard.
it
is
a
standard
that
is
rigorous,
it
is
workable,
it
has
functioned
effectively,
and
it
has
accommodated
the
sixth
amendment
values
and
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
finality.
the
wealth
of
experience
that
has
been
developed
in
the
circuits
and
the
unanimous
consensus
in
the
laboratories
that
have
functioned
in
this
area
of
assessing
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
should
be
embraced
wholeheartedly
by
the
court
and
not
abandoned.
thank
you.
