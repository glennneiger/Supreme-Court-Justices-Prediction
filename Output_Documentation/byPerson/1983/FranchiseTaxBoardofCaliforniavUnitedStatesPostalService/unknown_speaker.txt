unknown
speaker
ms.
kitching,
is
that
the
standard
procedure
in
california
whereby
the
state
collects
delinquent
taxes?
it
doesn't
go
to
court
to
get
a
garnishment,
but
it
just
kind
of
has
an
assessment
like
the
irs?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
just
true
of
government
employees,
but
it's
true
of
everybody.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
kitching,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say...
or
did
you
say
that
it's
the
same
thing
as
judicial
judgment,
that
it's
treated
likewise?
unknown
speaker
the
administrative--
unknown
speaker
--what's
this?
by
judicial
decision?
unknown
speaker
is
it
recorded
like
a
judgment
and
things
like
that,
like
a
judicial--
unknown
speaker
--well,
file
a
lien,
file
a
lien
on
real
estates,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
waiver
of
immunity
that
you're
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
garnishment
in
connection
with
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you're
suing...
you're
suing...
you're
suing
the
postal
service?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
gives
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
question
about
that,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
when
you
refer
to
garnishment,
it
included
also
a
prejudgment
garnishment
simply
on
the
basis
that
a
tax
had
been
identified
and
ascertained.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather,
mrs.
kitching,
your
whole
argument,
or
do
i
correctly
understand
it,
is
that
you
come
within
the
sue
and
be
sued
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
because
the
assessment
is
treated
like
a
judicial
judgment.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
whole
argument.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
kitching,
do
you
plan
to
address
the
jurisdictional
question
at
all,
whether
this
is
a
proper
appeal?
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
hold
california's
law
preempted.
it
just
interpreted
the
federal
legislation
as
not
providing
for
a
waiver.
do
you
think,
then,
that
it's
a
proper
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
one--
unknown
speaker
--could
read
it
the
other
way
and
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
just
said
the
federal
legislation
didn't
do
what
you
said
it
did.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
kitching,
why
did
california
not
use
the
other
way
of
having
the
government
collect
the
money
for
them?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question
right
there.
unknown
speaker
the
argument,
i
know,
has
proceeded
entirely
on
the
question
whether
there's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
but
when
you
read
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
the
burr
case,
he
seems
to
assume
that
the
congress
could
have
decided
either
to
confer
immunity
or
not
to
confer
immunity
without
even
reaching
the
question
of
labor.
do
you
agree
that...
that
there
would
be
sovereign
immunity
here
if
congress
had
said
nothing
at
all
about
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
law
on
the
question
whether
an
agency
such
as
this
automatically
picks
up
the
federal
government's
immunity
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
that
at
least...
do
you
argue
or
don't
you
that
there's
no
immunity
to
start
with?
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
your
position.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it's
something
we
ought
to
decide
before
we
decide
whether...
you
don't
decide
whether
something's
been
waived
unless
you
first
decide
that
it
would
have
been
there
to
be
waived.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if...
even
if
there
was
no
immunity
in
the
first
place,
the
argument
is
that
your...
that
the
agreement
between
the
postal
service
and
the
state
forbids
collecting
delinquent
taxes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
even
the
burr
opinion
was...
used
the
term
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
as
well
as
the
expression
justice
stevens
referred
to
about
conferring
immunity.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
it
didn't
speak
just
in
one
voice
on
the
subject,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
kind
of
ambiguous,
because
it
says
no
question
is
the
power
of
congress
to
waive
the
governmental
immunity
is
present.
they
say
there's
no
waiver
issue
in
the
case.
that's
what
justice
douglas
said
on
page
244.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't...
it
certainly
has
got
something
to
do
in
the
sense
that
it
didn't
authorize
the
collection
of
delinquent
taxes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
didn't
one
of
the
legislative
reports,
either
house
or
senate,
say
affirmatively
that
this
was
to
try
to
cooperate
fully
with
the
states
in--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
not
inconceivable
that
congress
thought
that
they
weren't
permitted,
that
the
state
was
not
permitted
to
collect
delinquent
taxes
by...
by
garnishment.
unknown
speaker
congress
may
well
have,
maybe
perhaps
mistakenly,
thought
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
didn't
have
the
reach
that
you
say
it
does.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's...
what
may...
why
is
it
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
that
the
postal
service
may
be
garnished
pursuant
to
a
court
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
postal
service
isn't
being
sued.
unknown
speaker
so
the
clause
really
means
more
than
being
sued
or
sued.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
if
the
california
law
says
final
administrative
assessments
have
the
force
of
a
judgment?
they're
unchallengeable.
they're
just
like
a
judgment.
and
then
you
garnish
the
postal
service
in
connection
with
this
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
part
of
the
state
law
says
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
lawsuit
in
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
your
basic
reason
for
that
that
your
concept
of
sue
and
be
sued
clause
means
a
garnishment
issuing
out
of
a
process
of
a
court?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
these...
if
the
administrator
here
instead
of
garnishing
on
the
assessment
went
to
court
and
got
a
state
court
judgment,
there
could
be
a
garnishment.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the...
even
though
the
state
law
says
don't
do
it
because
you
already
have
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
say
don't
do
it,
but
it
says
that
you
already
have
the
judgment.
but
they
did
say
it.
unknown
speaker
what
can
happen
after
this
assessment
becomes
what's
called
a
judgment
under
state
law?
what
can
happen
after
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume...
anyway,
there's
a
final
assessment,
is
that
it?
and
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
says
that's
the
equivalent
of
a
judgment
under
our...
under
our
law.
what
can
happen
to
it
after
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
the
taxpayer?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
taxpayer?
forget
about
the
garnishment
for
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
final
assessment.
what
can
the
taxpayer
do
about
it
besides
paying?
unknown
speaker
so
the
tax
assessment
is
not
final
in
the
sense
that
the
taxpayer
can
never
challenge
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
the
taxpayer...
if
the
taxpayer-employee
of
the
postal
service
gets
garnished,
like
california
wants
to
do,
and
they
take
the
money
out
of
his
pay,
and
then
he
challenges
the
tax,
he's
going
to
get
his
money
back.
it's
just
that
he's
having
to
pay
in
advance.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
what
do
you
mean?
you
mean
the
postal
service,
even
though
it's
holding
funds
under
a
garnishment,
nevertheless
would
feel
obligated,
holding
this
week's
salary
under
a
writ
of
garnishment,
would
feel
obligated
to
pay
the
salary
to
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
certainly
covers
that
if
the
garnishment
issued
out
of
court.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
were
a
judgment,
it
would
be
collected
from
the
post
office?
unknown
speaker
california
could
do
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
problem
here
is
the
word
"judgment"?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
one
thing,
the
word
"judgment"?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
that's
involved.
and
california
says
this
is
a
judgment.
if
california
passes
a
statute
that
says
that
this
is
now
labeled
a
judgment,
then
you're
out
cold.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
california
said
this
is
a
suit?
unknown
speaker
they'd
have
to
do
more,
then.
unknown
speaker
they'd
have
to
go
to
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
go
to
court?
suppose
they
named
us
as
the
tax
court?
unknown
speaker
a
tax
court?
unknown
speaker
and
the
tax
court
issued
a
judgment.
unknown
speaker
you
would
honor
it.
unknown
speaker
but
we're
not...
we're
not
engaged
in
semantics
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
are
there
any
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
a
federal
agency
is
not
immune
from
judicial
process
but
is
immune
from
some
kind
of
administrative
process?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
doctrine...
what
is
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity?
it's
immunity
from
suit,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you...
what
case
talks
about
immunity
from
anything
other
than
suit?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
it
couldn't,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
keifer...
the
keifer
case
really
says
the
first
question
is
has
congress
created
an
immunity
when
it
created
this
agency.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
justice
frankfurter
said
is
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
even
went
farther,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
and
said
that
when
there
was
a
silence
with
respect
to
the
smithsonian
institute,
that
there
was
no
implied
immunity.
unknown
speaker
without
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
mr.
strauss.
supposing
the
california
procedure...
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
did...
required
the
taxpayer
to
pay
the
tax
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
an
assessment.
would
that
make
any
difference?
in
other
words,
that
there...
that
he
had
to
part
with
his
money
before
he
could
question
the
assessment.
then
the
money
that
would
be
collected
from
the
government
would
have
to
be
paid
before
he
could
raise
any
question
about
it.
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
quite
that
clear?
i
think
there's
something
to
your
opponent's
distinction
between
withholding
and
levy
under
assessment.
unknown
speaker
but
withholding...
are
you
talking
about
withholding
taxes
that
the
employer
owes
or
taxes
that
should
have
been
withheld
from
an
employee?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
i
don't
think
that's
quite
the
same.
unknown
speaker
why?
i
don't
understand
that.
just...
you're
talking
about
just
withholding
current
taxes.
without
this
legislation,
i
don't
suppose
the
post
office
department
would
have
any
authority
whatsoever
to
withhold
from
an
employee's
pay
state
taxes.
unknown
speaker
which
would
be
after
an
assessment
levied--
--yes,
exactly.
--by
the
franchise
tax
board.
exactly.
and
withholding
taxes
aren't
collected
by
assessment
levies.
unknown
speaker
but
ordinarily,
withholding
taxes
simply
aren't
collected
by
levy.
they
may
be
collected
under
the
threat
of
levy,
but
they're
simply
collected
by
the
employer
agreeing,
perhaps
under
threat
of
levy,
to
withhold
from
the
employee's
paycheck.
unknown
speaker
the
employee...
you're
just
bootstrapping.
unless
the
employer
has
the
authority
to
withhold
something
from
the
employee's
wages,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
delinquent
withholding
taxes.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
so
there
won't
be
any
delinquent
withholding
taxes
to
be
collected
by
a
levy.
so
this
statute
was
essential
to
have
the
employer
deduct
from
the
wages
every
month
a
portion
of
the
employee's
estimated
tax.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
could
possibly
authorize
the
employer
from
withholding
wages.
if
the
employee
went
to
the
employer
and
says
how
come
you're
withholding
money
from
me;
pay
me
my
whole...
and
he
says
well,
i
just...
i
just
want
to
cooperate
with
the
state.
unknown
speaker
he
would
lose.
the
employer
would
lose.
unknown
speaker
the
employer...
state
taxes,
or
he
can't
give
you...
can't...
can't
issue
an
order
to
them
saying
withhold
taxes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
the
position
of
california
is
that
you
are
sued.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
here.
unknown
speaker
--will
be
defended.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
should
our
interpretation
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
section
401
be
affected
in
any
way
by
our
understanding
of
congress'
intent
in
trying
to
set
up
an
independent
agency
with
the
postal
service?
should
the
structure
and
intent
of
congress
help
us
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause?
now,
while
it
isn't
set
up
totally
as
an
independent
business,
as
you've
already
said,
congress
attempted
to
move
in
that
direction
and
give
the
postal
service
more
businesslike
attributes
and
make
it
a
more
independent
agency.
and
it
seems
to
me
one
of
those
attributes
might
well
be
that
it
should
be
subject
to
administrative
withholdings
in
the
nature
of
a
garnishment
such
as
this.
is
that
possible?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
that
whole
waves
of
litigation
is
an
accurate
description.
this
seems
like
a
pretty
normal
state
activity
to
want
to
collect
its
taxes
and
to
treat
the
administrative
garnishment
much
like
a
judicial
garnishment.
unknown
speaker
are
there
a
fair
number
of
agencies
with
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
who
are
not
protected,
as
you
suggest,
by
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
if...
if
you
win
this
case
and
the
california
legislature
passed
a
statute
and
said
that
before
serving
any
levies
on
or
tax
assessments
on
the
u.s.
postal
service,
you
shall
go
over
to
the
nearest
judge
and
get
it
signed
by
a
judge,
and
then
you
may
serve
it,
would
that
cure
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
take
much
more
than
that,
in
any
event,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
and
how...
how
does
it
matter
to
the
united
states
whether
that
intervention
takes
place
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
limit
my
question
to
cases
in
which
an
official
authority,
an
official
representative
of
the
state
of
california
is
proceeding
against
the
government
agent.
can
it
then
make
any
difference
whether
you
get
the
intervention
of
the
judicial
officer
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
there...
i
don't
know
what
you'd
remove
if
they
serve
you
with
an
assessment.
you're
not...
the
postal
service
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
contesting
the
amount
of
the
assessment,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
under
burr
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
allows
garnishment
prior
to
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
certainly
burr
has
dicta
in
it.
so
i
mean
you're
not...
in
answer
to
justice
stevens,
you're...
you're
not
talking
basically
about
a
situation
in
either
case
where
there's
been
a
final
adjudication
of
the
right.
unknown
speaker
but
in
response
to
that,
you
earlier
told
me
it
didn't
matter
if
he
had
to
pay
the
judgment...
pay
the
assessment
in
order
to
challenge
it.
you'd
still
take
the
same
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
describe
to
me
what
california
would
have
to
do
to
make
this
law
compatible
with
your
views
of
a
judicial
decision.
unknown
speaker
you
have
the
tax
board,
and
the
tax
court
finds
a
delinquency
in
the
payment
of
state
income
taxes.
unknown
speaker
at
that
point
would
the
statute
have
to
provide
that...
that
the
state
would
have
to
go
to
court
to
enforce
the
delinquency?
unknown
speaker
well,...
well,
if...
if...
if
the
state
went
to
court,
would
it
sue
the
postal
service?
unknown
speaker
the
taxpayer.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
tax...
the
tax
board
has
already
found
that
the
taxpayer
owes
them
money
and
had,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
attorney
general,
a
due
process
hearing
and
lost.
are
you
suggesting
that
california
now
would
have
to
provide
an
additional
procedure
in
which
there
would
be
a
trial
before
a
judge?
unknown
speaker
they
don't
now
under
california
law,
but
i'm
trying
to
ascertain
what
california
would
have
to
do
to
comply
with
what
you
said
it
must
do
before
it
can
garnishee
the
salary
owed
by
the
postal
service.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
administrative
agency
provided
all
of
the
due
process
that
a
court
would
provide?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
regulatory
commissions
in
every
state
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
the
government
that
have
both
judicial
and
administrative
legislative
powers.
unknown
speaker
they
would.
unknown
speaker
they
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
judgment
to
get
to
this
point.
i
suppose
90
percent
of
all
the
garnishments
in
the
united
states
are
prejudgement.
the
garnishment
is
served
on
the
same
day
as
the
first
process.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
if
they
did
it
that
way
in
california,
started
the
suit,
served
the
garnishment,
it
would
wash
out
because
they
would
probably
have
no
defense
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
comport
with
studies
on
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
they
were
reduced
after
snydak,
but
they're
still
overwhelmingly
prejudgments.
unknown
speaker
well,
while
you're
on
policy,
why
don't
you
have
the
postal
authority
to
deduct
it,
to
withhold
it?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
have
the
postal
authority
to
withhold
the
taxes
from
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
you
can
do
that
with
a
piece
of
paper.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
expect
the
postal
authority
to
collect
the
money
that
they
work
on
outside
jobs,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
