ms.
patti
s.
kitching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
because
the
ninth
circuit
has
created
an
anomaly.
it
has
allowed
one
california
taxing
agency
to
garnish
property
held
by
the
postal
service
on
behalf
of
a
third
party,
but
has
prohibited
another
state
taxing
agency
from
using
a
similar
garnishment.
this
is
even
though
both
agencies
use
analogous
tax
collection
procedures.
in
addition,
seven
circuits
have
found,
and
the
postal
service
concedes,
that
garnishment
by
ordinary
judgment
creditors
should
be
honored.
it
must
be
emphasized
that
none
of
these
garnishments
were
on
property
belonging
to
the
postal
service.
the
garnishments
were
on
property
held
by
the
postal
service
as
a
mere
stakeholder.
the
issue
in
this
case,
then,
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
should
have
allowed
the
franchise
tax
board
to
garnish
the
wages
of
postal
service
employees
who
did
not
pay
their
california
income
tax.
california
submits
that
there
are
two
controlling
propositions
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
postal
service
has
been
waived,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
must
honor
a
garnishment
for
delinquent
taxes
on
wages
of
employees.
the
second
proposition
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
when
it
found
that
an
unrelated
federal
statute
dealing
only
with
wage
withholding
preempted
the
franchise
tax
board
statute
and
garnishment.
this
case
arose
because
various
postal
service
employees
did
not
pay
their
california
income
tax.
these
taxes
are
not
in
dispute.
they
were
either
self-assessed
or
became
final
by
assessment
of
the
franchise
tax
board.
in
order
to
collect
these
taxes,
the
franchise
tax
board
attempted
to
garnish
the
wages
of
these
employees,
but
the
postal
service
refused
to
honor
the
garnishment.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
your
honor.
our
statutes
are
very
similar
to
those
of
the
irs.
and
in
our
state,
once
an
assessment
has
become
final,
the
assessment
has
the
force
of
a
judgment.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
this
is
true.
as
i
will
discuss
a
little
later
in
more
detail,
before
our
tax
assessment
becomes
final,
the
taxpayer
is
given
a
multitude
of
remedies.
the
taxpayer
can
go
through
several
levels
of
administrative
review
before
the
taxpayer
has
to
pay
the
tax
and
before
it
comes
final.
once
it--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--absolutely.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
absolutely,
your
honor.
under
california
law,
the
franchise
tax
board
is
given--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--it...
it's
by
both,
your
honor.
by
the
code
of
civil
procedure
and
also
by
judicial
decision.
and
as...
as
this
court
has
found
in
the
bull
case,
bull
v.
united
states,
and
gm
leasing,
the
internal
revenue
service
statutes,
which
are
similar
to
those
of
the
franchise
tax
board,
when
the
tax
assessment
is
final,
it
has
the
force
of
a
judgment.
so
we
think
we
have
ample
authority
to
show
that
our
tax
assessment--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes.
we
can
file
a
lien,
your
honor.
we
can
file
a
lien
and
execute
on
the
lien.
we
can
have
the
sheriff
serve
a
warrant.
we
can
levy
on
the--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes,
yes.
it
is
given
the
force
of
a
judgment,
your
honor.
it
is.
and...
and
that
is
similar
to
that
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
that
is
the
procedure
in
tax
matters.
because
the
taxpayer
is
given
quite
a
bit
of
opportunity
to
present
his
facts
and
theories
about
whether
the
tax
assessment
is
due.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
there's
section
401
of
the
postal
reorganization
act
which
found
that
the
postal
service
may
sue
and
be
sued.
and
secondly,
the
burr
case
interpreted
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
to
include
garnishment.
and
as
this
court--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
we
believe
we
have
the
equivalent
of
a
judgment,
and
that
we
fit
under
the
burr
case.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
we
are.
just
like
a
judgment
creditor
would
sue
them
if
their
garnishment
were
not
honored.
sue
and
be
sued
is
a
term
of
art,
and
it
means
that
sovereign
immunity
has
been
waived
to
a
certain
degree.
burr
determined
that
that
degree
included
garnishment,
and
the
reasoning
in
the
burr
case
pointed
out
that
the
government's
liability
has
not
been
expanded.
they
already
owe
the
money
to
their
employee,
and
now
a
creditor
is
coming
in
and
asking
for
the
money,
and
the
liability
of
the
government
isn't
expanded.
they
had
to
pay
it
anyway.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that's
right.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we
don't
believe
there
is.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
there
are
only
two
ways
that
a
tax
could
become
final
in
california.
first,
it
would
be
self-assessed,
of
course,
and
then
that...
that's
no
question.
and
the
only
other
way
is
after
the
tax
person
or
the
taxpayer
has
had
the
opportunity
to
go
through
administrative
proceedings.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that
is
what
we
argue,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
it
expands
the
liability
of
the
postal
service,
and
we
believe
that
we
should
be
given
at
least
equal
respect
to
an
ordinary
judgment
creditor
because
we're
a
taxing
agency
trying
to
collect
the
revenue
for
the
state
of
california,
and
yet
the
postal
service
will
honor
the
levy
of
an
ordinary
judgment
creditor,
and
we
think
that's
backwards.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
we
do.
it...
it's
difficult
to
exactly
understand
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
try
to
explain
how
they
could
have
come
to
their
conclusion.
as
you
know,
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
had
no
problem
with
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
makes
it
interesting,
because
that's
the
primary
argument
of
the
postal
service
in
this
case;
yet
the
ninth
circuit
had
no
problem
with
that.
the
ninth
circuit,
we
feel,
did
find
that
our
statute
was
preempted
as
applied.
we
feel
that
they
decided
that
once
we...
once
we
had
signed
this
agreement,
that
that
agreement
didn't
allow
us
to
use
our
garnishment
statute
to...
to
levy,
and
thereby
they...
they
voided
our
statute--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--pursuant--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--except
that
they
didn't
find
any
problem
generally
with
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
would
have
won
that
case
just
as
the
employee
development
department
did,
we
feel,
had
not
they
felt
section
5517
precluded
our
recovery.
therefore,
we
feel
they
would
have
found
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
that
this
statute
stood
in
our
way
and
voided
our
state
statute.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
california's
remedies
are
cumulative,
just
as
the
remedies
of
the
internal
revenue
service
are
cumulative.
it...
it
is
important
to
have
a
prompt
and
efficient
collection
of
tax,
and
this
is
a
very
efficient
way
to
collect
tax.
and
we...
we
have
other
remedies,
but
we
should
be
allowed
to
use
all
of
our
remedies.
the
internal
revenue
service
can
use
all
of
their
remedies,
and
we
should
be
able
to
use
all
of
ours.
and
sometimes
taxpayers
don't
have
other
property
that
we
can
file
liens
against,
but
perhaps
they're
employed
and
we
can
levy
on
their
wages.
so
there
are
reasons
when
this
would
be
the
only
way
we
could
collect
the
tax--
as
i
mentioned,
there
was
a
companion
case.
the
employment
development
department
also
filed
a
lawsuit
because
its
garnishment
was
not
honored.
they
are
responsible
for
collecting
employment
taxes,
and
their
procedures
are
similar
to
those
of
the
franchise
tax
board.
the
cases
were
consolidated,
and
the
district
court
found
for
the
postal
service.
on
appeal
the
cases
were
also
consolidated.
as
i
said
with
regard
to
the
appeal
of
the
employment
development
department,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
garnishment
should
be
honored.
they
found
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
had
waived
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
postal
service.
also
as
i
said,
the
ninth
circuit
found,
however,
that
our
garnishment
was
preempted
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
because
we
had
signed
the
agreement
with
the
federal
government.
in
essence
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
a
statute,
5
u.s.c.
section
5517,
which
was
enacted
to
help
the
states
collect
their
revenue
from
all
federal
employees,
should
be
interpreted
to
prohibit
the
state
of
california
from
garnishing
the
salary
of
postal
service
employees.
the
dissenting
judge
found
that
the
franchise
tax
board's
garnishment
should
be
honored.
she
found
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
would
treat
tax...
tax
debts
any
differently
than
it
would
treat
other
debts.
in
fact,
she
concluded
that
the
application
of
the
california
collection
procedures
was
the
only
result
which
would
further
congress'
intent
to
treat
the
postal
service
as
a
private
employer.
we
submit
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
postal
service
has
been
waived
with
regard
to
our
garnishment.
in
1970--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we
mentioned
that
in
our
brief
because
of
that
comment
in
the
burr
case,
and
we
thought
it
was
an
important
issue.
we
don't
need
to
argue,
i
don't
think,
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
immunity.
we
argue
rather
that--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--i
believe
the
burr
case
is
authority
that
it
does
not
automatically
pick
up
the
immunity
of
the
government.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we...
we
raise
that
issue.
we
are
not
premising...
we
are
not
relying
on
that
argument.
we
think
it's
an
issue
in
this
case.
we
don't
feel
we
need
to
rely
on
that
argument
for
us
to
prevail.
if
there
is
no
immunity--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i...
i
have
read
many
decisions.
there
have
been
many,
many
decisions
by
courts.
seven
circuits
have
decided
issues
regarding
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
postal
service,
and
i
don't
believe
in
any
of
those
seven
decisions
has
one
of
the
courts
addressed
that...
first
that
question.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that's
what
they
argue,
your
honor.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we
don't
agree
with
that.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that's
right.
i
believe
the
burr
decision
is
a
very
favorable
decision
for
our
position.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we...
we
believe
that
that
was
an
issue.
that
would
make
our
case
easier,
i
believe,
but
we
don't
think
we
have
to
solely
rely
on
that.
i
think
we...
even
if
there
was
some
kind
of
immunity,
we
can
argue
that
it
was
waived
by
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
in
1970,
congress
created
the
postal
service.
it
was
organized
to
operate
in
a
businesslike,
efficient
manner.
at
least
four
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
found
that
it
was
launched
into
the
commercial
world.
this
court
in
fha
v.
burr
found
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
permits
garnishment.
we
feel
that
the
burr
case
is
controlling
and
is
authority
for
our
position
in
this
case.
comparable
to
the
decision
in
burr,
the
franchise
tax
board
is
simply
treating
the
postal
service
as
a
stakeholder
and
requiring
it
to
turn
over
money
otherwise
payable
to
its
employees.
we
do
not
become
involved
with
postal
service
functions
or
property--
recognizing
that
the
postal
service
is
a
mere
stakeholder
in
this
case,
a
decision
for
the
franchise
tax
board
cannot
be
relied
upon
by
other
administrative
agencies
to
burden
the
postal
service.
furthermore,
if
a
decision
sustaining
the
franchise
tax
board
is
going
to
create
the
administrative
burden
that's
portrayed
by
the
postal
service,
then
why
wasn't
the
comparable
and
adverse
employment
development
department
decision
appealed
from
the
ninth
circuit?
even
though
the
postal
service
is
simply
a
stakeholder,
it
alleges
that
california's
income
tax
garnishment
should
not
be
honored.
it
argues
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
only
waives
postal
service
immunity
with
regard
to
judicial
proceedings.
this
argument
does
not
recognize,
however,
the
similarity
of
tax
assessment
procedures
to
judicial
proceedings.
as
i
stated,
it
was
not
necessary
for
california
to
obtain
a
court
judgment,
because
a
tax
assessment
is
given
the
force
of
a
judgment.
it
should
be
given
the
force
of
a
judgment
because
the
procedure
conducted
is
much
the
same
way
as
a
trial.
i
will
go
into
a
little
more
detail
as
to
the
administrative
procedure.
i
think
it's
important.
during
the
administrative
procedure,
the
taxpayer
is
allowed
to
fully
develop
his
facts
and
legal
theories.
he
can
not
only
present
them
to
the
franchise
tax
board,
but
he
can
present
them
to
an
independent
appellate
administrative
agency.
in
addition,
he
is
entitled
to
an
oral
agency
before
that
other
agency.
it
is
only
after
he
has
been
afforded
his
due
process
rights
that
the
assessment
can
be
final,
and
only
then
does
he
have
to
pay.
this
is
a
valid
reason
why
our
tax
assessment
should
be
given
the
force
of
a
judgment
and
why
our
tax
garnishment
should
be
honored.
by
requiring
the
franchise
tax
board
to
obtain
a
judgment
even
after
this
administrative
process
has
been
completed,
the
postal
service
would
require
the
repetition
of
the
same
process
in
a
judicial
setting.
this
obviously
does
not
comport
with
the
prompt
collection
of
revenue.
our
final
assessment,
as
i
stated,
also
has
authority
to
be
given
the
force
of
a
judgment
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
bull
v.
united
states
and
gm
leasing...
gm
leasing
was
decided
in
1976
by
a
unanimous
court...
this
court
affirmed
the
principle
that
a
tax
assessment
has
the
force
of
a
judgment.
the
principle
was
necessary,
as
this
court
explained,
because
the
existence
of
government
depends
upon
the
expedient
collection
of
its
revenue.
even
though
the
foregoing
principles
have
been
recognized
by
this
court,
the
postal
service
refused
to
give
the
franchise
tax
board
garnishment
at
least
the
same
respect
to
that
of
an
ordinary
judgment
creditor.
it
must
be
emphasized
again
that
the
postal
service
is
merely
a
stakeholder
in
these
garnishment
proceedings.
during
these
proceedings
it
is
not
being
asked
to
turn
over
its
own
funds;
it
is
simply
being
asked
to
turn
over
funds
owing
to
employee
taxpayers
who
have
refused
to
pay
their
valid
state
taxes.
the
postal
service
will
not
remit
these
funds
to
the
franchise
tax
board;
yet
it
must
make
such
remittances
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
employment
development
department,
and
to
ordinary
judgment
creditors.
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
rights
of
these
judgment
creditors
were
only
recognized
after
repetitious
and
unsuccessful
litigation
by
the
postal
service
in
seven
circuit
courts
of
appeals.
the
postal
service
makes
a
secondary
argument
with
regard
to
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
attempts
to
support
it
with
section
5520
of
5
u.s.c.
that
section
authorizes
the
withholding
of
local
income
taxes
from
federal
employees.
the
postal
service
alleges
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
specifically
include
the
postal
service
in
section
5520
if
sovereign
immunity
had
been
waived.
this
is
incorrect.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear
the
postal
service
did
not
want
to
be
included
in
section
5520.
it
proposed
separate
legislation
whereby
each
postal
service
employee
could
decide
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
have
local
taxes
withheld.
congress
was
informed
that
the
history
of
the
postal
service
employees
was
one
of
delinquency
in
the
payment
of
their
local
taxes.
subsequently,
the
postal
service's
recommendation
of
voluntary
compliance
was
completely
rejected.
thus,
the
postal
service
was
specifically
included
in
order
to
remove
all
doubt
that
it
was
required
to
comply
with
local
withholding.
this
inclusion
has
nothing
to
do
with
sovereign
immunity.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that's
the...
the
section
5517,
and
i'm...
5517
goes
to
the
collection
of
state
taxes,
and
5520--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--went
to
the
collection
of
local
taxes.
and
as
i
just
said,
section
5517
authorizes
the
federal
government
to
withhold
current
state
taxes
from
the
salaries
of
federal
employees.
in
1974,
california
and
the
department
of
the
treasury
signed
an
agreement
under
section
5517
which
implemented
current
withholding
from
federal
employees.
section
5517
agreements
do
not
provide
authority
for
a
state
to
require
an
amount
to
be
taken
from
a
federal
employee's
wages
in
payment
of
a
delinquent
tax
liability.
california
has
not
attempted
to
use
this
agreement
for
such
purposes;
rather,
our
authority
to
garnish
postal
service
employees'
wages
emanates
from
section
401
and
the
burr
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
confused
the
concept
of
current
withholding
with
the
collection
of
a
delinquent
tax
and
incorrectly
held
that
these
concepts
involve
the
same
subject
matter.
in
their
opinion,
the
agreement
covered
both
areas.
they
did
not
understand
what
the
term
"withholding"
meant,
and
that
it
was
a
term
of
art.
they
incorrectly
determined
that
any
amount
taken
from
a
postal
service
employee's
wages,
either
for
current
taxes
or
delinquent
taxes,
was
withholding.
because
of
this
confusion,
i
will
briefly
illustrate
the
difference.
probably
everyone
in
this
room
has
an
amount
withheld
from
each
salary
payment
to
satisfy
this
year's
tax
liability.
hopefully,
the
total
amount
withheld
over
the
year
will
be
sufficient
to
meet
the
annual
obligation.
this
procedure
is
known
as
current
withholding.
the
collection
of
delinquent
taxes
concerns
a
different
subject
matter.
if
someone
fails
to
satisfy
a
final
tax
liability
in
a
timely
way,
the
unpaid
amount
is
delinquent.
that
is
when
summary
tax
collection
procedures,
like
wage
garnishment,
take
place.
in
this
example,
section
5517
covers
only
the
first
part,
current
withholding.
it
cannot
and
has
not
been
used
by
california
as
authority
for
the
second,
the
collection
of
delinquent
taxes.
this
conclusion
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history
which
makes
clear
that
congress
enacted
section
5517
to
cooperate
with
the
states
in
the
administration
of
their
tax
laws.
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
when
california
signed
the
withholding
agreement
it
forfeited
its
authority
to
collect
delinquent
taxes
from
the
wages
of
postal
service
employees.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
the
collection
of
taxes
by
levying
on
wages
and
the
collection
of
delinquent
taxes
is
such
an
important
function
to
the
state
that
it's
inconceivable
to
us
that
congress
would
say
in
order
to
have
the
federal
government
collect
your
withholding,
the
current
taxes
due
now
for
this
year,
you
must
give
up
the
right
to
collect
delinquent
taxes
from
the
wages
of
those
same
employees.
that
is
inconceivable
that
congress
would
do
that
to
the
states,
if
congress
was
attempting
to
cooperate
with
the
states--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--well,
we
don't...
we...
the
agreement
that--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--we
don't
think
that
congress
had
any
of
that
in
mind
when
it
enacted
5517.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
and
at
that
time
it
was
meant
to
be
a
gift
to
the
states
as
to
all
federal
employees,
and
the
postal
reorganization
act
came
almost
20
years
later.
and
in
that
act
the
congress
decided
that
the
postal
service
could
sue
and
be
sued.
now,
we
think
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
would...
would
only
allow
us
to
participate
in
the
withholding
if
we
gave
up
the
right
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes
from
the
wages
of
the...
of
these
taxpayers.
we
don't
see
any
history
for
that.
the
agreements
don't
say
that.
it
only
says
that
we
can't
use
that
agreement
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes.
we
are
not
using
that
agreement
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes.
we're
using
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
burr
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--the
postal
service
apparently
does
not
feel
confident
of
the
preemption
argue,
since
they
devoted
only
about
two
pages
in
their
brief
to
that
argument,
and
has
not
addressed
that
argument
today.
therefore,
we
feel
basically
that
they
are
arguing
the
sovereign
immunity.
as
i
said
before,
the
franchise
tax
board
feels
it
comes
directly
under
the
burr
case
and
that
it
is
not
expanding
any
liability
of
the
postal
service.
the
postal
service
would
not
have
to
divert
any
of
its
own
funds.
the
funds
do
not
belong
to
the
postal
service.
they
belong
to
the
employee.
the
solicitor
general
has
admitted
that
the
collection
of
taxes
from
postal
service
employees
has
become
very
difficult,
and
we
submit
that
the
postal
service
should
cooperate
with
the
state
of
california
in
collecting
these
taxes.
instead
of
being
helpful,
however,
the
postal
service
attempts
to
raise
the
shield
of
sovereign
immunity
to
protect
delinquent
taxpayers.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
pardon
me?
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
your
honor,
the
problem
is--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--that's
right,
your
honor.
we
can
have
a
certain
amount
withheld.
however,
employees
can
earn
money
from
other
sources
and
end
up
with
a
delinquency
even
though
they
had
some
money
withheld.
so
that's
not
the
only
way
to
collect
the
tax,
and
sometimes
it
isn't
enough.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
no,
we
don't.
but
i'm
explaining
that's
why
the
taxpayer
would
have
an
additional
tax
liability
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
collect
through
garnishment.
thank
you,
your
honors.
