mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
linchpin
of
my
friend's
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
california
state
administrative
tax
levy
has
the
force
of
a
judgment
or
is
the
equivalent
of
a
judgment.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
but
more
to
the
point,
i
don't
think
it's
fruitful
to
try
to
discuss
in
the
abstract
whether
the
california
administrative
levy
has
the
force
of
a
judgment.
the
question
is
what
congress
intended,
and
specifically,
what
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
a
routine
sue
and
be
sued
clause
as
part
of
the
postal
reorganization
act.
the
question
is
whether
when
congress
did
this
it
intended
to
subject
the
postal
service
to
these
administrative
levies.
now,
in
our
view,
when
congress
said
that
the
postal
service
could
be
sued,
that's
what
it
meant.
it
meant
that
the
postal
service
could
be
subject
to
a
lawsuit
in
court,
not
that
the
postal
service
could
be
subject
to
an
administrative
order
issued
without
any
judicial
proceeding
whatever.
this
court
has
always
interpreted
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
according
to
their
literal
meaning.
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
authorizes
a
lawsuit.
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
does
not
say
and
it
does
not
mean
that
sovereign
immunity
has
simply
become
inapplicable
to
a
federal
agency's
affairs.
now,
i
think
that
what's
happened
is
because
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
are
so
common
and
familiar,
the
franchise
tax
board
has
succumbed
to
the
temptation
to
forget
that
it
is,
after
all,
language
in
a
statute,
and
it's
to
be
interpreted
in
the
first
instance
at
least
according
to
its
plain
meaning.
that
is,
as
i
said,
how
the
court
has
interpreted
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
and
when
congress
was
including--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
in
fha
against
burr
this
court
said
that
garnishment,
post
judgment
garnishment
is
an
incident
of
a
suit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
argument
was
made
in
fha
against
burr,
too,
and
the
court's
answer
was
that
the
garnishor--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no.
the
court's
answer
was
that
the
garnishor
was
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
employee.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
as
long
as
it
is
not
part
of
a
lawsuit,
and
there
is
no
contention
here
that
it
is
part
of
a
suit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
state
law
can't
alter
the
meaning
of
the
federal
law.
i
don't
deny
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
it's
hard
to
tell
what's
an
administrative
proceeding
and
what's
a
suit,
but
this
is
plainly
not
such
a
case.
after--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
in
connection
with
a
lawsuit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
absolutely.
if
the
franchise
tax
board
were
to
reduce
its
tax
delinquencies
to
judgments--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
don't
know
that
the
state
law
says
don't
do
it.
my
understanding
is
that
state
law--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no.
there's
no...
this
is
not...
this
is
not...
one
of
the
ways
in
which
this
is
not
a
judgment
is
that
after
it
is
issued,
someone
else
can
institute
a
suit
to
challenge
it.
the
judicial
proceedings
in
the
california
courts
begin
after
this
order
has
been
issued
and
they
be
done
by
someone
else
other
than
the
franchise
tax
board.
this
order
has
no
connection
to
a
suit,
to
a
court,
to
a
judicial
process,
to
judicial
proceedings.
it's
not
reviewed
by
a
judge.
it's
not
issued
by
a
judge.
it
doesn't
enforce
a
court's
judgment.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i...
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
place
in
the
state
statutes
where
it
is
called
a
judgment.
after
it's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
my
understanding
is
it's
served
on
the
employer,
and
it's
the
employer--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
the
taxpayer,
if
the
employer
honors
it,
the
taxpayer--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--okay.
the
taxpayer--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
taxpayer
has
to
challenge
it
administratively,
and
if
the
administrative
challenge
does
not
succeed,
the
taxpayer
has
to
institute
a
suit.
the
suit
then
works
its
way
up
through
the
california
courts
and
to
this
court
if
there's
a
federal
issue.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
the
taxpayer
goes
to
court
to
challenge
it.
i
mean
in
a
sense,
to
put
the
point
bluntly,
this
is
no
more
like
a
judgment
than
any
tort.
it's
an
action
taken
by
one
person
against
another
that
can
give
rise
to
a
lawsuit
if
the
person
who
is...
who
is
at
loss
as
a
result
of
the
action
chooses
to
challenge
it.
otherwise,
it
has
no
connection
to
a
lawsuit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
if
he
successfully
challenges
the
tax.
it's
not
just
that.
it's
that
the
postal
service
will
have
to
divert
its
funds
from
the
objects
for
which
congress
designated
now,
the
payment
of
this
employee,
in
advance
until
the
matter
is
resolved.
and
i
should
also--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--oh,
no.
it
wouldn't
feel
obligated
to
pay
the
salary
to
the
employee,
but
it
would...
the
basis
of
the
doctrine
in
this
area
is
that
it
disrupts
congress'
design
for
a
federal
agency
to
have
to
pay
funds
to
the
creditor
instead
of
to
the
employee.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
if
the
garnishment
is
issued
postjudgment,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
from
the
postal
service,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
yes.
absolutely.
if
the
franchise
tax--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
problem
is
that
california
hasn't
sued
us.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
problem
is
the
word
"judgment"
or
the
word
"sue".
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
no,
no.
certainly
not,
justice
marshall.
california--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--california...
the
critical
word
is
the
word
"sue".
that's
the
word
in
the
statute,
the
word
"sue"
and
"sued".
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
california
were
to
make
it
a
suit--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--they
could,
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
they
would
have
to
go
to
court.
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
they
were
to
set
up
a
court--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
they
were
to
set
up
a
court,
even
a
tax
court--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--and
the
tax
court
issued
a
judgment--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we
would
honor
it.
now,
that
goes
to
the
point
that
was
brought
out--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it's
not
just
semantics.
this
distinction
between
state
administrative
agencies
and
courts,
while
obviously
there
are
borderline
cases,
there
are,
whenever
you
have
a
distinction,
it's
sometimes
clear.
and
this
is
an
instance
in
which
it's
clear.
it's
also
a
distinction,
i
should
point
out,
that's
drawn
by
congress
in
28
u.s.c.
2283;
they
have
the
injunction
act.
it's
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
many
exhaustion
doctrines
which
say
you
have
to
exhaust
state
administrative
remedies
but
not
state
judicial
remedies.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know
that
this
issue
has
ever
come
up.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it's
immunity
from
suit
and
state
process.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
don't
know
that
a
state
has
ever
attempted
to
enforce
its
administrative
process
against
federal
agencies,
presumably
because
it
was
clear
that
it
couldn't.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
there's
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
it
couldn't
or
that
it
could.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
a
state
decided--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i
think
that's...
that's
right
in
the
case
of
agencies
like
those
involved
in
keifer.
i
think
what
justice
frankfurter
was
doing
there
was
taking
that
agency,
and
he
said
this...
this
looks
exactly
like
these
other
40
agencies
to
which
congress
has
attached
sue
and
be
sued
clauses.
so
unless
there
is
some
reason
to
think
otherwise,
we
are
going
to
assume
that
congress
meant--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that
it
was
historically
accepted
that
the
smithsonian
institute--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that...
that...
that
is
true,
because
it,
too,
was
structured
like
these
agencies.
the
postal
service,
however,
is
not
structured
in
the
least
bit
like
those
agencies.
there
is
a
great
deal
of...
of
discussion
in
the
appellant's
brief
designed
to
show
that
the
postal
service
is
really
just
like
a
private
corporation.
that
was
not
congress'
idea
at
all.
congress
specifically
rejected
a
proposal
to
make
the
postal
service
a
corporate
body,
and
instead
put
it
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
the
postal
service
has
a
dozen
protections
that
any
private
corporation
would
love
to
have
and
several
handicaps
that
would
cause
any
private
corporation
to
fold
up.
i
think,
as
i
said,
the
critical
question
is
whether
california
has
sued,
whether
it
has
gone
to
court.
that's
the
language
that
this
court's
opinions
have
used
in
interpreting
sue
and
be
sued
clauses.
the
court
said
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
makes
an
agency
amenable
to
judicial
process.
it
said
that
a
suit
for
purposes
of
the
clause
is
a
proceeding
in
a
court
of
justice
or
litigation
between
parties
in
a
court
of
justice
or
the
proceeding
by
which
the
decision
of
a
court
is
sought.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
our
position.
the
one
other
point
that
i
think
is
important
is
that
in
this
case
in
addition
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
language
interpreted
by
this
court
to
mean
suits,
we
have
unusually
strong,
if
somewhat
unconventional,
evidence
that
the
very
congressional
committees
that
drafted
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
put
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
into
it
would
have
been
very
surprised
to
learn
that
they
had
rendered
the
postal
service
subject
to
orders
like
the
franchise
tax
board.
shortly
after
the
postal
reorganization
act
took
effect,
municipal
tax
collectors
from
several
major
cities
came
to
congress
and
complained
that
local
income
tax
delinquencies
of
federal
employees
had
become
a
serious
problem.
and
as
my
friend
pointed
out,
postal
service
employees
were
frequently
the
subject
of
this
discussion,
apparently
because
they're
very
large
in
number,
they're
present
in
every
city,
and
the
turnover
in
postal
service
jobs
is
very
rapid,
and
that
makes
collection
more
difficult.
now,
these
local
tax
collectors
sought
legislation
from
congress
that
would
permit
the
withholding
of
local
income
taxes
from
the
wages
and
salaries
of
federal
employees.
now,
as
i
said,
this
proposed
legislation
was
considered
by
the
same
committees
that
had
recently
drafted
the
postal
reorganization
act.
it
was
the
post
office
and
civil
service
committees
of
both
houses.
now,
the
board
concedes
in
its
brief
that
if
its
interpretation
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
were
correct,
the
local
tax
collectors
did
not
need
any
additional
legislation
to
deal
with
the
postal
service.
they
could
just
have
issued
administrative
orders
to
the
postal
service,
as
they
would
have
to
any
other
employer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
california
statutes
provide
that
withholding
taxes
can
be
collected
in
precisely
the
same
way;
in
fact,
under
the
very
same
statutory
provision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
withholding
taxes
that
the
employer
should
have
withheld
from
the
employee.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if...
if...
i
mean
this
is
not...
i
think
this
point,
justice
rehnquist,
is
not
in
dispute;
that
if
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
means
what
the
franchise
tax
board
says
it
mean,
that
this
legislation
sought
by
the
local
tax
collectors
and
subsequently
passed,
the
section
5520
of
title
5,
is,
in
their
words,
superfluous?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
would
have
the
same
authority
that
it
has
now
to
withhold
delinquent
taxes
from
the
employees.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
but
there's...
no...
nothing
in
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
that
suggests
there's
a
difference
between
an
assessment
levy
and
a
withholding
tax
levy.
it's
an
administrative
levy
designed
to
facilitate
the
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
assume
they're
collected
because--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there's
not
going
to
be
any
delinquent
withholding
taxes.
there
may
be
delinquent
taxes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
agree
that
it
was
essential,
justice
white,
but
only
because
of
our
interpretation
of
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
if
the
franchise
tax
board's
interpretation
of
that
clause
is
correct,
then
the
taxing
authority--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--he
would
say,
presumably--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--he
would
say
i
have
this
order
from
the
state
taxing
authority.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't...
i
don't
know
why
not,
if
state
process
allows
it,
as
state
process
would.
there
is
no
federal
bar...
there
would
be
no
federal
bar
to
the
taxing
authority
issuing
an
order,
an
administrative
order
to
the
postal
service
saying
pay
us
x
amount
of
taxes
out
of
the
employee's
pay.
and
whether
these
are
anticipated
or
delinquent
liabilities
certainly
doesn't
reflect
anything
in
federal
law.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
yes.
that's...
that's
pursuant
to
legislation,
5517.
that's
right.
those
statutes
are
now
on
the
books.
my
point
is
that
at
the
time
that
the
local
tax
collectors
asked
for
that
legislation,
they
came
to
congress
right
in
the
wake
of
the
postal
reorganization
act,
asked
that
legislation
with
respect
to
the
postal
service,
and
were
not
told
why
do
you
need
this
legislation;
we
gave
you
what
you
needed
in
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
you
already
have
it
with
respect
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
you're
sued
now
or--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
in
this
case
that's...
that's
a
complexity
that...
that
i
think,
you
know,
is...
needs
to
be
understood,
justice
marshall.
we
don't
claim--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
they
win
this
suit,
justice
marshall,
then
they
won't
have
to
sue
us.
then
we
will
be
obligated
to
honor
the
administrative
levies.
we
don't
claim
that
this
suit
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
we
claim
that
we
win
this
suit
on
the
merits
because
we
didn't
have
to
honor
the
administrative
levy.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
think
that's
true,
justice
o'connor.
what
congress...
it's
true
that
congress
did
change
the
organization
of
the
postal
service
in
some
ways,
but
it
did
also
put
in
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
and
it's
the
construction
of
that
clause
that's
really
at
issue.
now,
i
should
say
that
i
suspect
when
the
drafters
of
the
act
put
in
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
they
did
not...
probably
did
not
envision
that
they
were
opening
up
the
postal
service
to
whole
waves
of
new
kinds
of
litigation.
they
probably
thought
they
were
doing
very
little.
there
is
no
explicit
consideration
of
the
clause
in
the
legislative
history,
and
from
all
appearances
they
treated
it
as
a
piece
of--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
is...
it
is
a
qualitatively
different
form
of
process
from
that
to
which
federal
agencies
are
subject.
there
is
no
dispute
that
if
they
tried...
if
the
franchise
tax
board
tried
to
serve
one
of
these
levies
on
any
other
federal
agency
that
the
agency
would
not
have
to
honor
it.
there
is,
i
take
it,
no
dispute
that
if
the
franchise
tax
board
had
sued
this
levy
on
the
post
office
department
before
1971,
the
post
office
would
not
have
had
to
honor
it.
so
the
only
question
is
whether
congress
withdrew
that.
when
congress
passed
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
i
should
point
out
it
also
made
the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
a
very
heavily...
a
very
heavy
qualification
on
any
waiver
of
immunity
from
suit
applicable
to
the
postal
service.
so
the
net
effect
on
the
postal
service
is
very
little.
in
the
common
run
of
contract
and
tort
cases,
all
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
did
was
to
make
a
plaintiff
name
the
postal
service
instead
of
the
united
states
as
a
defendant.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
don't
know,
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's...
that
begins
to
get
into
this...
into
this
borderline
area
that
comes
up
in
these
other
instances
in
which
the
court
has
to
distinguish
between
state
administrative
agencies
and
state
judicial
bodies,
like
lynch
against
hasl.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
at
some
point
the
intervention
of
a
judicial
officer
would
make
this
a
judicial
proceeding,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
stevens.
when
the
post
office...
the
postal
service
itself
is
the
party
in
interest,
when
the
state,
or
for
that
matter
it's
just
adventitious
that
this
case
involves
a
state,
when
a
private
party
is
trying
to
invoke
state
administrative
process
to
obtain
postal
service
assets
because
he
has
a
dispute
with
the
postal
service.
if
he
proceeds
against
the
postal
service
in
state
court,
the
postal
service
can
remove
the
proceeding.
congress
saw
to
it
that
the
postal
service
would
have
the
right
to
get
out
of
state
court
and
into
federal
court
when
it
wanted
to.
if
he
proceeds
against
it
in
a
state
administrative
agency,
the
postal
service
can't
remove
it.
when
the...
when
the
postal
service
is
not
the
real
party
in
interest,
when
it's,
as
this
case,
the
postal
service
is
holding
funds--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
it
can,
at
least
for
purposes
of
removal.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
no.
that's
why
i
confined
my
answer
to
cases
in
which
the
postal
service
is
the
real
party
in
interest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in
cases
like
this,
the...
the
interest
is
different
and
in
a
way
greater.
i
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
employee
who
is
subject
to
this
levy,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
he
has
been
sued
and
has
been
to
court
and
has
had
a
chance
to
have
his
defenses
heard
and
has
a
final
judgment
entered
against
him
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
under
pretty
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
allows
attachment
of
a
federal
agency
when
you
have
a
dispute
with
the
federal
agency.
the
court
has
not
yet
held
that
prejudgment
wage
garnishment--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if...
if...
if
the
case
involves
prejudgment
wage
garnishment,
justice
rehnquist,
that's
right
that
there's
been
no
final
adjudication,
of
course.
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
prejudgment
wage
garnishment,
i
gather,
is
practically
no
longer
used
because
it's
so
difficult
to
conform
to
procedural
requirements.
and
second,
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference
if
the
employee
is
already
in
court,
and
he's
involved
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
his
rights
and
liabilities
are
going
to
be
determined,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
initiate
a
suit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
if
the
state
law
required
that
the
employee
would
have
to
pay
the
assessment,
yes,
i
think
as
far
as
the
postal
service
was
concerned,
we
would
still
say
that
like
other
federal
agencies,
we
don't
have
to
honor
this
assessment
at
all.
i
don't
know
where
that
would
leave
the
employee
under
state
law.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
would
have--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
statute
wouldn't
have
to
provide
that
in
order
to
collect
from
the
postal
service.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
would
sue...
i
don't
know
what
the
form
of
the
suit
would
be.
i
suppose
the
form
of
the
suit
would
be
against
the
taxpayer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
but
what
the
court
said
in
burr--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--my
understanding,
justice
powell,
is
that
they
don't
have
to
provide
any
adversary...
i
think
they
may
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
they
don't
have
to
provide
any
adversary
hearing
at
all.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
would
have
to
go
to
court,
justice
powell.
they
would
have
to
sue.
and
our
reason
for
that
is
that
that's
what
the
statute
says.
it
authorizes
the
postal
service
to
be
sued,
and
the
court
has
said--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
if
an...
if
it
were
a
court
and
not
an
administrative
agency,
and
as
i've
said,
there
are
borderline
cases.
but
this
is
a--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right.
there
is
no
contention,
as
i
understand,
that
they
are,
in
fact,
a
court,
and
so
they
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
sue.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
and
that's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--my
impression,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
prejudgment
wage
garnishments
are
not
widely
used
any
more
because
of
snydak
and
other
decisions
imposing
strict
procedural
requirements
on
them,
and
that
they're
not
a
very
popular
remedy.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
as
i
said--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
that
was
my
impression
from...
from
the
government's
experience
with
garnishment
orders.
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
could
have
distinguished,
the
congress,
whether
it
makes
sense
to
attribute
to
congress
a
distinction
between
garnishments
issued
incident
to
or
pursuant
to
or
an
execution
of
a
lawsuit
or
an
order
to
give
a
court
jurisdiction.
and
orders
that
are
not
garnishments,
that
are
not
connected
to
a
court
or
to
judicial
process
at
all.
and
in
view
of
this
court's...
since
the
question
in
the
case
is
the
interpretation
of
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
and
since
the
court
has
consistently
said
that
sue
and
be
sued
clauses
have
to
do
with
judicial
process
and
judicial
proceedings,
i
think
the
best
understanding
of
congress'
intent
is
that
it
did
intend
to
subject
the
postal
service
only
to
orders
connected
to
court
proceedings
or
judicial
proceedings
and
not
to
unadjudicated
administrative
orders.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
