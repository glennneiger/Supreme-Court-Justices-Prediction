unknown
speaker
which
case
are
you
from
or
in?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
does
the
employer
have
to
meet
with
them?
unknown
speaker
could
the
employer
meet
with
somebody
else
too?
unknown
speaker
separately?
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
them
in
the
same
meeting
with...
could
he
have
them
at
the
same
meeting
when
he
meets
with
the
exclusive
representative?
unknown
speaker
this
statute
is
really
about
the
legislature
of
minnesota
directing
its
agents
whom
to
meet
with,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
requires
them
to
meet
with
one
group
and
its
option
with
another,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
is...
i
thought
you
said
under
the
state
law,
if
the
employer
chose
to
meet
with
other
groups,
he
could
without
violating
any
state
law.
unknown
speaker
to
the
exclusive
representative
under--
unknown
speaker
--now,
may
he
meet
and
listen
to
others
besides
the
exclusive
representative?
unknown
speaker
and
he
wouldn't
be
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
was
asking
you
awhile
ago.
now,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question.
is
he
in
violation
of
the
state
law
if
he
meets
with
other
people
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
difference
in
subject
matter
between
bargaining
issues
and
meet
and
confer
issues?
unknown
speaker
does
the
statute
define
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
line
the
legislature
has
drawn?
unknown
speaker
has
that
term
been
defined
by
your
courts?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
definition?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
certainly
affects
the
way
i
look
at
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
under
state
law,
anybody
but
the...
that
the
employer
would
violate
state
law
if
he
meets
on
meet
and
confer
issues
with
anybody
but
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
say
he
does...
say
he
meets
with
a
group
other
than
the
exclusive
representative
and
he
goes
through
exactly
the
same
routine
as
he
does
with
the
exclusive
representative,
and
if
you
say
he
must
just
listen,
then
he
just
listens.
now,
if
that
is
all
he
does,
he
is
all
right
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
understood
from
what
you
said
earlier
that
the
board
could
make
no
response
on
any
proposals
that
were
suggested
by
the
non-union
meet
and
confer
group.
unknown
speaker
apart
from
the
constitutional
issue,
i
think
the
factual
question
that
i
understood
justice
white
was
making
inquiry
about,
is
what
actually
happens?
what
sort
of
utility
would
be...
what
purpose
would
be
served
by
such
a
meeting
if
all
the
board
sat
there
mum
while
people
presented
ideas
and
there
was
no
discussion,
no
suggestions,
no
advice?
would
that
serve
any
purpose?
unknown
speaker
but,
that
would
come
form
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
suppose
the
employer
meets
with
a
group
other
than
the
exclusive
representative.
can't
he
do
with
that
group
on
meet
and
confer
issues
precisely
what
he
could
do
with
the
exclusive
representative?
unknown
speaker
whatever
kind
of
a
dialogue
the
statute
contemplates
on
meet
and
confer
issues
between
the
exclusive
representative
and
the
employer,
the
employer
can
engage
in
with
others.
it
is
exactly
the
same
procedure.
that
is
not
what
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier.
you
changed
your--
--i
agree.
unknown
speaker
i
think
before
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
arguably
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
unknown
speaker
even
on
matters
in
the
contract.
oh,
no.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
matters
that
are
not
covered
by
the
contract,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
for
all
of
this.
yes,
but
you
just
again
confined
your
answer
to
receiving
the
views.
you
are
very
evasive
on
whether
they
can
respond
or
not.
i
really
don't
know
your
position.
may
the
representatives
of
the
governing
body
respond
to
non-union
people
at
a
separate
meet
and
confer
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
without
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice?
unknown
speaker
may
the
employer
respond
to
the
exclusive
representative
in
a
meet
and
confer
meeting?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
employer
to
respond?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
told
me
awhile
ago
that
he
could...
the
employer
could
go
through
exactly
the
same
routine
with
a
non-exclusive
representative
group
as
he
could
with
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
interfere
with
your
rights
to
present
your
views
on
management
issues?
unknown
speaker
for
the
employer
to
have
a
meeting
and
listen
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
you
still
don't
tell
us
very
much
about
responding
to
the
presentation.
that
presents
the
problem.
can
they
negotiate?
unknown
speaker
arguably
there
may
be
no
response.
unknown
speaker
no,
under
meet
and
confer.
unknown
speaker
under
meet
and
confer
your
view
is
that
arguably
there
can
be
no
response
to
a
non-union
presentation
of
views.
unknown
speaker
but,
isn't
that
also
true
of
a
meet
and
confer
presentation
by
the
certified
representative?
that
isn't
a
negotiating
session.
unknown
speaker
so,
is
there
much
difference
in
the
kind
of
response
that
an
employer
would
give
to
two
different
meet
and
confer
sessions,
one
with
minority
or
representatives
of
the
other
with
the
certified
representative?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying...
let's
see
if
i
can
get
it
clear
for
myself.
the
employer
can
listen
to
anyone.
unknown
speaker
and,
he
can
do
it
informally
or
formally?
unknown
speaker
and,
he
can
mix
the
two
groups
up
and
listen
to
both
of
them
at
once?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
these
dissidents,
to
identify
them
in
quotation
marks,
do
they
have
the
same
status
and
posture
at
this
joint
meeting
as
the
ones
you
regard
as
the
official
representatives?
unknown
speaker
has
there
ever
been
such
a
meeting,
a
subsequent
meeting,
some
ad
hoc
group?
unknown
speaker
but,
suppose
half
a
dozen
faculty
members
were
designated
as
a
committee
representing
the
18
non-union
faculty
members
who
are
involved
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it
and
requested
the
opportunity
on
specified
dates
regularly
to
present
their
views
to
the
board
at
a
formal
meeting
of
the
board.
what
would
the
consequence
of
that
request?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
authorities
to
support
that
interpretation
of
your
law?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
employer
wouldn't
have
to
meet
with
them?
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
it
called
a
public
meeting,
but
the
difference
here
is
that
the
law
requires
the
employer
to
meet
with
the
exclusive
representative--
unknown
speaker
--and
doesn't
require
them
to
meet
at
all
with
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
is
even
that
quite
right?
does
the
statutory
provision
dealing
with
meet
and
confer
expressly
refer
to
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent?
could
it
not
be
consistent
with
the
statute
for
the
majority
for
meet
and
confer
purposes
to
elect
someone
else?
unknown
speaker
right.
but,
does
it
have
to
be
the
same
representative
that
represents
them
for
the
other
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
sounds
to
me
like
he
is
forbidden
to
meet
with
anybody
but
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
but,
as
i
understand
it,
the
minority
or
non-union
people
can
only
communicate
when
such
a
communication
is
a
part
of
the
employee's
work
assignment.
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
mean
that
is
in
subdivision
7?
unknown
speaker
that
employee's
work
assignment?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
he
just
didn't
think
the
tuition
was
right
in
the
school,
he
couldn't
talk
about
that.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but,
certainly
the
statute
implies
that
he
may
not.
maybe
the
statute
is
invalid
to
that
extent
of
course.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
full,
faithful,
and
proper
performance
and
so
forth--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
exclusive
representative
might
think
some
of
this
dissident
activity
interferes
with
his
exclusive
privileges.
unknown
speaker
does
this
reference
you
recently
made
to
the
statutory
section
prohibiting
the
employer
from
meeting
and
conferring
with
anybody
except
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
lead
you
to
qualify
any
of
your
earlier
answers
about
what
the
employer
could
do
with
respect
to
meetings
with
people
other
than
the
certified
bargaining
representative?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
understand--
--i
can't
figure
it
out.
i
can't
either.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
given
answers
at
360
degrees.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
are
not.
unknown
speaker
about
what
subject
matters?
unknown
speaker
the
administrator
would
have
a
terrible
job
trying
to
know
which
hat
he
has
on,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
practically
daily,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
tell
me
the
difference
between
meet
and
confer
and
negotiate?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
actual...
what
goes
on.
unknown
speaker
when
you
meet
and
confer
you
are
not
negotiating?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not?
unknown
speaker
once
you
decide
that
the
subject
is
meet
and
confer
or
this
is
the
subject
of
negotiating,
you
do
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
now
i
am
lost.
unknown
speaker
good.
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
read
subparagraph
7
to
say
that
on
a
subject
such
as
the
budget
the
employer
shall
not
meet
and
confer
with
anyone
except
the
union?
unknown
speaker
so
they
can't
talk
to
a
dissident
group
about
the
budget?
unknown
speaker
the
cannot
have
a
meet
and
confer
session
with
the
dissident
group
about
the
budget?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
state
interest
that
is
served
by
that
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
none
of
which
are
bargainable
subjects?
unknown
speaker
none
of
which
are
proper
subjects
for
mandatory
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
matter
of
state
interest
not
to
have
divergent
views
on
the
policy
type
issues
that
you
have
been
mentioning?
unknown
speaker
but,
is
it
contrary
to
state
policy
to
have
divergent
views?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
be
pretty
dreary
for
some
of
the
administrators
if
they
had
to
sit
up
there
and
listen
to
not
only
all
the
gripes
of
the
collective
bargaining
representative,
but
all
the
individual
gripes
of
everybody,
you
know,
ad
nauseam.
unknown
speaker
by
statute
it
prohibits
the
expression
of
them
in
similar
meetings,
as
i
understand
it,
so
it
clearly
opposes
it.
surely
it
does.
statutory
prohibition
against
expression
of
divergent
views
in
comparable
meetings.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
state
policy
is
we
want
to
hear
one
voice
on
the
budget,
not
two
voices.
unknown
speaker
and
nobody
else.
unknown
speaker
or
in
a
comparable
session
either,
in
that
session
or
any
one
patterned
after
it.
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
saying
that
the
state
statute
then
is
unconstitutional.
that
is
right.
because
it
prevents
precisely
what
you
just
said
the
first
amendment
guarantees.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
vieira,
you
speak
as
though
the
public
employer
and
the
minnesota
legislature
were
two
different
entities.
i
don't
see
this
case
as
any
different
than
if
each
of
these
public
employers,
each
of
these
presidents
of
bemidji
junior
college
or
whatever
it
might
be,
decided
on
their
own
to
do
exactly
what
the
statute
said.
they
are
all
creatures
of
the
state
and
when
the
state
tells
them
to
do
something,
they
do
it.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
remove
the
first
amendment
analysis
at
all,
but
i
just
question
your...
perhaps
i
drew
the
wrong
implication
from
what
you
are
saying
as
if
these
administrators
would
somehow
complain
about,
the
administrators
rather
than
the
faculty
members
could
complain
about
being
imposed
upon
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
vieira,
if
there
had
been
no
statute
at
all
and
you
had
a
school
board
administrator
who
simply
decided
that
he
was
willing
to
confer
with
a
single
faculty
member
whom
he
liked
and
admired
and
he
wasn't
going
to
talk
to
anybody
else
on
matters
relating
to
the
subject
of
the
meet
and
confer
law
and
just
chose
to
talk
to
that
individual.
is
that
a
first
amendment
violation
of
the
rights
of
any
other
faculty
member
with
whom
the
administrator
does
not
choose
to
confer?
unknown
speaker
influencing
policy.
unknown
speaker
what
case
supports
that
argument?
you
are
talking
about
the
first
amendment
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
they
can
attempt
but
he
won't
listen.
there
is
no
case--
--they
think
there
is
a
constitutional
right
that
the
administrator
has
to
listen,
is
that
right?
what
case
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
no
case
has
ever
held
the
employer
has
to
listen.
those
are
two
entirely
propositions.
unknown
speaker
and,
it
says
that
it
will
happen
in
a
particular
manner
through
the
collective
bargaining
agent.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
talking
about,
an
ex
post
facto
condition
in
a
civil
case?
for
the...
the
ex
post
facto
clause
applies
only
to
criminal
cases.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
discrimination
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that...
i
would
suppose
you
would
still
be
attacking
the
statute
on
the
same
grounds
if
the
meet
and
confer
committees
had
included
non-union
members
as
well.
if
that
is
the
discrimination
you
are
talking
about,
that
is
certainly
different
than
saying
that
only
a
certain
group
of
employees
may
talk
to
the
employer.
after
all,
the
people
the
statute
says
the
employer
must
meet
with
are
the
elected
representatives,
are
the
exclusive
representatives.
they
are
then
not
just
faculty
members,
they
have
been
elected
as
exclusive
representatives
and
they
represent
everybody
in
the
bargaining
unit,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
so,
how
is
it
discriminatory
at
all?
unknown
speaker
under
the
statute,
how
do
you...
who
goes
to
the
meet
and
confer
meetings
now
the
way
they
are
run?
unknown
speaker
the
way...
who
goes
to
the...
yes,
the
way
they
were
run,
the
way
that
you
objected
to.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
say
the
employer
couldn't
meet
with
anybody
except
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
those
are
people
other
than
the
exclusive
representative,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
the
exclusive
representative
could...
suppose
they
chose
15
people,
half
of
them
non-union
and
half
of
them
union.
that
would
not
violate
the
statute,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
now
do,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now
non-members
can
vote
for
the
representative.
unknown
speaker
but
your
adversaries
challenge
that
on
appeal,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vieira,
i
wonder
if
the
state
wasn't
operating
on
a
premise
that
deserves
a
little
more
recognition
than
i
think
you
give
it.
it
is
one
thing
to
have
a
faculty
senate
get
together
and
pass
a
bunch
of
resolutions,
but
i
remember
the
remark
of
a
colleague
of
mine
in
a
former
employment
who
had
been
a
member
of
a
law
faculty.
he
said
that
the
only
thing
worse
than
the
meetings
of
the
law
faculty
were
the
meetings
of
a
full
faculty,
that
the
meetings
of
a
full
faculty
simply
never
ended.
if
you
are
talking
about
a
meeting
of
people
to
get
together
and
pass
a
resolution
when
everyone
there
is
voluntarily
present
it
is
one
thing,
but
to
require
the
administrators
to
sit
and
attend
something,
i
think
the
state
has
a
right
to
say
you
channel
it,
you
don't
have
to
listen
to
every
single
individual.
now,
that
is
not
interfering
with
the
right
of
petition,
but
it
is
just
the
idea
of
the
administrator
being
on
the
scene
and
kind
of
reacting.
he
can't
be
there
for
five
or
six
days.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
are
not
saying
then
that
every
faculty
member
has
a
right
to
be
present
and
speak
at
this
meet
and
confer
session?
you
are
only
saying
that
they
should
have
a
right
to
cast
a
vote
for
the
election
of
the
representative
who
is
there
and--
unknown
speaker
--you
wouldn't
be
satisfied
if
the
employer
said,
well,
you
people
who
are
disaffected
or
who
are
non-union
members,
i
will
meet
with
your
representatives
too
separately.
you
go
ahead
and
get
together
and
elect
me
a
half
a
dozen
people
and
the
next
day
after
i
meet
with
the
exclusive
representative
i
will
meet
with
your
representatives.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
suppose
the
statute
were
declared
unconstitutional
in
its
present
form
and
instead
of
having
an
election
like
the
district
court,
it
said
the
employer
should
meet
with
the
representatives
of
the
minority.
would
that
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
i
am
only
asking
you.
the
district
court
rewrote
it
at
your
behest
considerably
i
must
say.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
whole
voting
system
is
just
simply
striking
something?
unknown
speaker
and
rewrote
the
statute
a
little
more.
unknown
speaker
and
rewrote
the
statute
a
little
more.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
derived
a
remedy,
not
in
that
form
but
in
the
form
of
saying
that
the
employer
shall
meet
with
the
committee
representing
the
minority?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
be
litigating
then
if
he
agreed
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
if
he
agreed
right
now
to
meet
separately
with
your
representatives
rather
than--
unknown
speaker
--no,
no,
no,
separately.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
and
on
matters
that
are
that
are
not
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
the
usual
collective
bargaining
process.
unknown
speaker
mr.
vieira,
are
you
basically
satisfied
with
the
order
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
let's
just
assume
that
the
meet
and
negotiate
provisions
are
valid
and
that
the
employer
may
be
required
to
negotiate
only
with
the
exclusive
representative
and
that
he
is
forbidden
to
meet
with
anybody
else
and
negotiate
on
those
things.
now,
if
that
is
a
valid
situation
scheme,
why
isn't
this
one?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
you
would
think
the
meet
and
negotiate
subject
matter
would
be
far
more
important
to
you
than
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
lost
it.
unknown
speaker
i
just
say
assume
that
we
had
taken
that
case
and
affirmed
it.
say
we
just
affirmed,
that
that
was
a
completely
constitutional
scheme
on
meet
and
negotiate
items
to
exclude
anybody
but
the
exclusive
representative.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
that
govern
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
an
employer
would
have
much
more
freedom
to
choose
whom
he
wanted
to
talk
with
with
respect
to
inherent
managerial
things
than
about
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
if
this
statute
was
completely
silent
on
the
meet
and
confer
aspect,
had
just
the
traditional
labor
relation
negotiating
provisions,
is
there
anything
that
you
know
of
in
federal
or
state
law
that
would
prevent
the
management
at
the
top
from
calling
on
a
committee
or
any
group
of
employees
they
wanted
to
discuss
the
subjects
of
management
that
you
are
talking
about
and
policies
if
they
wanted
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
allowed
the
minnesota
administrators
to
talk
with
anyone
they
want
about
problems
of
management
including
their
own
employees,
not
only
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
no
employer
is
here
attacking
the
minnesota
statute
on
that
basis
either.
this
is
an
attack
by
people
who
want
to
talk
to
the
employer,
not
an
attack
by
the
employer
who
claims
his
first
amendment
rights
are
being
denied.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
meant
when
i
asked
you
why
you
needed
any
statute
at
all
to
have
meet
and
confer
sessions
under
the
minnesota
statute.
unknown
speaker
but,
the
meet
and
confer
statute
limits
the
authority
of
the
administrators
to
discuss.
i
mean,
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about
really,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
call
it
discrimination.
it
is
at
any
rate
a
limitation
on
that
authority.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn't
dictate
to
the
exclusive
representative
to
choose
only
union
members
to
go
to
the
meetings.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
private
choice
of
the
union.
how
are
you
going
to
blame
the
state
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
certainly
didn't
order
them
to
do
it
and
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
it
is
state
policy
that
the
union
is
doing
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
they
couldn't
challenge
it.
unknown
speaker
they
couldn't
challenge
it.
an
administrator
of
a
state
institution
has
no
right
to
assert
against
a
command
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
statute,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
still
was
the
union
decision
about
how
to
structure
its
committees.
it
wasn't
a
state
decision
about
how
to
structure.
unknown
speaker
the
decision
to
exclude
your
client,
that
was
purely
a
union
decision
or
a
private
decision.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
