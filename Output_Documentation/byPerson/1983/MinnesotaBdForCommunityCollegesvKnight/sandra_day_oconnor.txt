justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
are
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court,
district
of
minnesota,
fourth
division.
they
are
not
as
easily
explained
orally
from
the
bench
as
the
prior
case.
they
concern
minnesota's
meet
and
confer
statute
for
it
state
employees.
the
statute
authorizes
that
state
employees
to
bargain
collectively
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
it
also
grants
its
professional
employees,
such
as
the
college
faculty,
the
right
to
meet
and
confer
with
their
employing
agencies
on
matters
related
to
employment
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
mandatory
bargaining.
however,
if
the
professional
employees
have
selected
an
exclusive
representative
for
mandatory
bargaining,
their
employing
agency
may
meet
and
confer
on
the
nonmandatory
subjects
only
with
the
exclusive
representative.
the
appellant
minnesota
state
board
for
community
colleges
operates
the
minnesota
community
college
system.
the
appellant
minnesota
community
college
faculty
association
is
the
designated
exclusive
representative
of
the
faculty
of
the
state's
community
colleges.
the
appellees
are
20
community
college
faculty
and
instructors
who
are
not
members
of
the
faculty
association.
the
appellees
filed
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
minnesota
meet
and
confer
processes.
the
district
court
held
that
the
meet
and
confer
provisions
of
the
statute
deprived
appellees
of
their
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
speech
and
associational
rights
by
denying
them
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
their
employer's
making
of
policy.
the
district
court
granted
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
meet
and
confer
provisions
do
not
violate
appellees'
constitutional
rights.
appellees
have
no
first
amendment
or
other
constitutional
right,
either
as
members
of
the
public,
as
state
employees
or
as
college
instructors
to
force
officers
of
the
state
acting
in
an
official
policymaking
capacity
to
listen
or
respond
to
appellees'
views.
neither
appellees'
status
as
public
employees
nor
the
fact
that
an
academic
setting
is
involved
gives
them
any
special
constitutional
right
to
a
voice
in
the
making
of
policy
by
their
employer.
even
assuming
that
first
amendment
speech
rights
take
on
a
special
meaning
in
an
academic
setting,
they
do
not
require
government
to
allow
teachers
to
participate
in
institutional
policymaking.
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
ensuring
that
its
public
employers
hear
one
and
only
one
voice
presenting
the
majority
view
of
its
professional
employees
on
employment-related
policy
questions.
the
statute
in
the
holding
of
the
court
today
does
not
deny
appellees'
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
parts
of
which
justices
brennan
and
powell
have
joined.
