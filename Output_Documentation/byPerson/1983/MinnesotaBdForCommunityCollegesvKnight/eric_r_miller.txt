mr.
eric
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wish
to
remind
the
court
in
this
consolidated
action
that
there
are
two
appellant
groups,
the
first
consisting
of
the
labor
organization,
and
the
second
consisting
of
state
officials.
we
have
agreed
upon
a
single
speaker
to
avoid
fragmentation
of
our
presentation.
we
do
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
officials
and
the
labor
organizations
have
both
common
interests
as
well
as
unique
interests
which
justify
this
court
in
reversing
the
lower
court.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
your
honor,
the
clients
that
i
represented
in
the
action
below
were
the
defendant
labor
organizations.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
state
public
employee
bargaining
law
violates
either
the
first
or
the
fourteenth
amendments
where
it
requires
a
public
employer
to
meet
and
confer
only
with
an
exclusive
representative
and
that
exclusive
representative
uses
only
its
members
as
apart
of
the
meet
and
confer
meeting.
in
the
alternative,
should
this
court
affirm
the
lower
court,
the
second
issue
is
if
every
public
employee
is
entitled
to
run
and
vote
in
elections
for
membership
on
the
meet
and
confer
committees,
do
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
that
a
system
of
cumulative
voting
be
utilized
in
those
elections.
the
fundamental
facts
in
the
case
are
neither
extensive
nor
in
dispute.
the
plaintiffs
are
individual
faculty
members
employed
on
several
of
the
campuses
of
the
18-campus
system
in
the
minnesota
community
college
system.
these
individual
faculty
member
plaintiffs
are
opposed
to
having
the
defendant
labor
organizations
represent
them
concerning
their
employment
interests.
the
defendant
labor
organizations
consist
of
the
minnesota
community
college
faculty
association,
the
mccfa,
which
is
a
voluntary
association
of
faculty
members
within
the
community
college
system.
it
is
the
legally
certified
exclusive
representative
for
all
of
the
faculty
members
within
the
community
college
system.
its
primary
purpose
is
to
represent
the
employment
interest
of
all
of
the
faculty
members.
the
minnesota
education
association
is
a
state-wide
voluntary
association
of
educators
which
is
the
state
affiliate
for
the
mccfa.
the
national
education
association
is
a
voluntary
association
of
educators
which
is
the
national
affiliate
of
the
mccfa
and
the
mea.
the
community
college
board
is
a
state
agency
of
minnesota
charged
with
the
management
of
the
community
college
system.
it
is
the
employer
of
the
faculty
members
involved
in
this
action.
our
public
employment
labor
relations
act
in
minnesota
was
passed
in
1971.
it
is
a
comprehensive
system
for
labor
relations
for
public
employers
and
public
employees.
its
stated
policies
of
pelra
are
to
promote
orderly
and
constructive
relationships
between
public
employers
and
public
employees;
that
unresolved
disputes
between
employers
and
employees
are
injurious
to
both
the
parties
as
well
as
the
public.
the
policy
section
further
specifically
indicates
that
one
of
the
policies
is
to
grant
the
employees
the
right
to
organize
and
choose
freely
their
representatives.
pelra
specifically
provides
for
a
democratic
selection
of
those
representatives
in
the
form
that
an
election
may
take
place
every
two
years
to
determine
who
the
exclusive
representative
for
the
faculty
members
in
this
particular
bargaining
unit
shall
be.
the
fundamental
framework
of
pelra
to
achieve
these
policies
is
the
use
of
the
concept
of
exclusive
representation
of
employees.
all
exclusive
representatives
under
pelra
are
obligated
to
meet
and
negotiate,
that
is
collectively
bargain
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
those
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
are
defined
expressly
in
pelra
as
being
the
hours
of
employment,
compensation,
and
the
personnel
policies
affecting
the
working
conditions
of
the
employees.
pelra
specifically
indicates
that
there
are
subjects
which
are
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
that,
in
our
state
statute,
is
referred
to
as
inherent
managerial
policy.
those
are
areas
of
discretion
in
policy
such
as
the
overall
budget,
the
organizational
structure
of
the
employer,
and
the
selection
and
direction
of
personnel.
thus,
there
are
two
major
arenas
of
activity
for
an
exclusive
representative;
that
is
negotiable
areas
and
non-negotiable
areas,
and
specifically
as
to
professional
employees
in
minnesota
the
exclusive
representative
is
charged
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
public
employer
concerning
areas
within
the
inherent
management
discretion
area.
this
is
a
right
that
is
not
extended
to
other
public
employees
other
than
professional
public
employees
in
minnesota.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
statute
requires
that
it
meet
at
a
minimum
every
four
months
with
the
representative
of
the
professional
employees
for
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
employer
could
meet--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--yes.
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
employer
has
met
regularly
with
both
the
individual
plaintiffs
as
well
as
other
faculty
members.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
think
they
could
and
that
has
taken
place.
the
record
will
indicate
that
in
this
case.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
that
is
correct.
this
is
a
statutorily
created
right.
that
is
the
right
of
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
is
optional
with
another
group.
there
is,
very
frankly,
justice
white,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
possibly
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
doing
that.
we
do
not
believe
though
that
that
raises
a
constitutional
questions
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
purpose
of
meet
and
confer,
we
believe,
is
private
consultation
not
only
to
permit
employees
to
freely
express
their
views,
which,
of
course,
is
their
first
amendment
right,
and
has
been
confirmed
in
this
record
as
well
as
under
pelra.
meet
and
confer
obligates
the
employer
to
listen
and
respond--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--yes,
sir.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
your
honor,
i
think
there
could
be
a
question--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--under
state
law
as
to
at
what
point
an
employer
meeting
and
conferring
with
someone
else
other
than
the
exclusive
representative
may
be
violating--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--i
believe
the
answer
is
going
to
be
dependent
on
whether
or
not
that
employer,
in
fact,
is
exchanging
views
and
holding
private
consultation
as
opposed
to
simply
receiving
the
views
of
individual
employees.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
most
definitely.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
statute
defines
that.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
that
is
a
line
drawn
by
the
legislature.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
line
that
the
legislature
has
drawn
is
that
matters
of
inherent
management
policy
shall
not
be
subject
to
meet
and
negotiate.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes,
it
is.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
not
unlike
the
problems
in
the
private
sector,
it
is
a
gray
and
moving
line.
part
of
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
employer
wants
to
collectively
bargain
about
that
subject
even
though
it
may
be
a
matter
of
inherent
management
right
and
make
it
a
permissive
subject.
and,
we
have
cited
several
decisions
in
our
brief
that
indicate
how
that
definition
of
a
meet
and
negotiate
subject
is
evolving
in
our
state.
there
is
no
bright,
clear
line.
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
in
response
to
your
inquiry,
justice
white,
is
that
that
line
does
not
connotate,
as
the
lower
court
did,
some
type
of
constitutional
right,
because
it
is
a
line
that
is
drawn--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--i
believe
the
employer
can,
either
at
a
public
meeting
or
as
indicated
in
this
record
in
sessions
held
on
campus--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--i
believe
so.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
again,
i
think
the
board
can
make
a
response,
but
the
question,
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
not
whether
or
not
that
causes
some
constitutional
infringement,
but
whether
or
not
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
obtain
the
majority
view
of
the
faculty
in
an
orderly
and
constructive
fashion.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes,
indeed,
it
would.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
it
may
freely
participate
in
dialogue--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--your
honor--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--the
question
is
hinged
on
the
fact
that
the
exclusive
representative
has
by
statute,
being
the
majority
representative,
the
opportunity
to
present
the
majority
view.
in
our
view,
there
is
nothing
to
restrict
the
employer
from
receiving
the
views
of
other
employees
as
well.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
am
sorry?
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
that
is
what
meet
and
confer
involves
only.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
believe
they
can
respond,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
believe
there
could
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--that
is
the
purpose.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
statute
indicates
that
individual
employees
have
the
right
to
express
their
views
so
long
as
it
does
not
circumvent
the
rights
of
the
exclusive
representative.
that
right
is
the
opportunity
to
meet
and
confer,
private
consultation,
in
regard
to
inherent
management
rights.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
does
not,
your
honor.
the
presentation--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--the
presentation
of
those
views
constitutes
no
problem.
i
am
sorry
for
any
confusion
on
that
issue.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
answer
is
no.
there
may
not
be
any
negotiation,
just
as
there
cannot
be
any
negotiation
by
a
non-certified
representative
in
collective
bargaining,
meet
and
negotiate.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
under
meet
and
negotiate--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--the
employer
cannot--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
is
not.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
no.
in
fact,
justice
rehnquist,
the
employer
may
decide
to
simply
receive
the
views
of
the
exclusive
representative
without
discussing
them
with
the
exclusive
representative,
because,
again,
the
employer
has
the
final
decision-making
power
concerning
those
non-negotiable
matters.
those
are
matters
of
policy
which
they
are
not
required
or
compelled
to
come
to
any
agreement
upon.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
think
that
witnesses
may
certainly
attend
a
formal
meet
and
confer
session,
but
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
just
as
the
purpose
of
exclusivity
in
collective
bargaining,
is
to
permit
in
an
orderly,
coherent
fashion
for
the
employer
to
receive
the
views
of
the
majority
representative.
to
permit
minority,
dissident
members
at
a
formal
meet
and
confer
session
to
present
their
views
at
the
same
time
in
contrast
with
the
views
of
the
majority
would
very
well
disrupt
that
orderly
process
just
as
it
would
if
the
dissident
minority
members
were
permitted
to
be
present
at
a
private
bargaining
session
and
indicate
disagreement
with
the
exclusive
representative
concerning
its
position
on
what
the
terms
and
conditions
ought
to
be.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
if
it
is
intended
to
be
one
of
the
once
every-four-month
meetings,
the
answer
is,
no,
they
do
not
have
the
same
status.
the
exclusive
representative
in
this
case,
the
mccfa,
has
been
democratically
selected
as
the
representative
of
the
faculty.
for
purposes
of
that
meet
and
confer
meeting,
the
employer
has
established
that
it
wishes
to
hear
the
views
only
in
that
particular
mode
of
the
exclusive
representative.
it
does
not
restrict
that
employer,
in
a
subsequent
meeting
immediately
after
a
meet
and
confer
meeting,
then
in
receiving
the
views
of
all
other
employees
concerning
any
matter.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
the
record
is
replete
that
the
community
college
board,
the
chancellor,
who
is
the
chief
executive
officer,
the
local
presidents
and
other
administrators
have
regularly
held
town
forums
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
views
of
all
other
employees
on
all
matters
that
are
included
under
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
none
whatsoever.
they
are
certainly
entitled
to
do
that.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
do
that?
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
would
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
city
of
madison
would
directly
support
that,
a
meeting
called
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
input
of
either
the
faculty
or
the
public
at
large,
that
they
would
be
guaranteed
their
first
amendment
freedom
of
expressing
their
views
concerning
all
subjects
under
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
if
it
calls
a
public
meeting,
your
honor,
i
think
it
certainly
would.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
is
exactly
right.
the
first
amendment
does
not
require,
and
this
court
has
so
held,
a
public
employer
to
meet
and
negotiate,
meet
and
respond
with
any
public
employee.
the
converse
of
that
is
that
a
public
employer,
therefore,
is
free
to
privately
consult
with
whomever
they
choose.
in
this
case,
the
legislature
in
minnesota
has
decided
that
the
employer
shall
meet
and
confer
in
private
consultation
with
the
designated
exclusive
representatives
of
the
professional
employees.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
statute
provides
that
the
professional
employees
shall
select
a
representative.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
another
portion
of
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
employer
shall
not
meet
and
negotiate
or
meet
and
confer
with
any
employee
or
group
of
employees
other
than
the
exclusive
representative
if
one
has
been
certified.
that
is
179.66,
subdivision
7.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
he
is...
the
employer
is
forbidden
to
meet
and
confer
which
means
private
consultation.
it
can
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
is
the
distinction
we
have
been
trying
to
draw.
no
first...
the
difference
does
not
go
off
on
any
first
amendment
right,
because
no
individual
employee
or
group
of
employees
has
the
right
to
compel
government
to
meet
and
discuss
and
respond
to
any
subject.
and,
the
state
has
created
that
right
for
exclusive
representatives
just
as
it
has
for
exclusive
representatives
in
meet
and
negotiate.
the
statutory
plan
very
simply
is
that
all
professional
employees
may
elect
in
a
democratic
procedure
any
exclusive
representative.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
employer
shall
not
meet
and
negotiate
or
meet
and
confer
with
anyone,
any
employee
or
group
of
employees
other
than
the
designated
exclusive
representative
if
there
be
one.
if
there
not
be
one,
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
is
the
professional
employees
would
be
free
to
select
a
representative,
but
if
there
is
an
exclusive
representative,
the
employer
must
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
no,
that
i
don't
believe--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--that
is
an
amendment
to
the
statute
which
i
believe
is
designed
to
protect
the
employer
that
it
will
not
be
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
receive
the
views
of
an
individual
employee
concerning
matters
that
are
part
of
their
work
assignment.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
think
he
certainly
can.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
freedom.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
that
way.
there
is
another
portion
of
pelra,
justice
stevens,
179.65,
subdivision
1,
which
guarantees
every
individual
employee
the
right
of
free
expression
or
opinion
so
long
as
it
does
not
circumvent
the
right
of
the
exclusive
representative.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
believe
that
there--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--it
might,
but
that
has
never
taken
place
as
far
as
i
know
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and
certainly
not
on
behalf
of
the
minnesota
community
college
faculty
association.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
well,
i
am
certainly
not
trying
to,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
let
me
try
my
hand
one
more
time.
the
principle
of
exclusive
representation
has
been
decreed
in
minnesota
to
permit
professional
employees
to
be
able
to
not
only
meet
and
negotiate
but
also
to
meet
and
confer.
that
meet
and
confer
means
the
exchange
of
views
and
concerns.
the
purpose
is
to
obtain
the
majority
view
of
the
majority
representatives.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
inherent
management
policy,
matters
that
are
not
in
collective
bargaining.
however,
that
line,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
before,
is
a
gray
and
uncertain
one.
an
example:
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
class
size,
which
has
been
negotiated,
is
said
that
it
must
be
reasonable.
however,
the
actual
class
sizes
are
determined
through
the
meet
and
confer
process
on
the
individual
campuses
as
to
how
large
the
classes
shall
be.
if
an
administration
wants
to
change
the
class
size,
it
must
do
it
through
advance
notice
and
meet
and
confer.
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
class
size
that
has
been
determined
through
meet
and
confer,
it
is
grievable
under
the
contract.
there
is
a
very
close
interrelationship
between...
for
professional
employees...
between
those
subjects
that
are
in
meet
and
confer
and
those
subjects
that
are
meet
and
negotiate
which
is
to
say
that
those
subjects
may
cross
the
line,
depending
on
the
wishes
of
the
party
or
the
will
of
the
legislature,
because
the
legislature
could
decree
that
there
are
no
inherent
management
subjects
and
everything
would
come
in
under
collective
bargaining.
there
would
be
no
private
right
of
meet
and
confer.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
might
very
well.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
well,
only
with
the
exclusive
representative
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
obligated
to
meet
and
negotiate
concerning
a
certain
subject
or
whether
it
is
an
inherent
management
policy
right
that
is
not
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
obligations.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
meet
and
negotiate
are
those
subjects
which
relate
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
meet
and
negotiate
involves
negotiating
a
salary
schedule,
negotiating
a
vacation.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--no,
you
are
not.
the
subjects
of
meet
and
confer
are
reserved
to
the
total
discretion
of
the
public
employer.
after
having
met
and
conferred
over
those
subjects
which
are
properly
in
meet
and
confer--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--yes,
your
honor,
meeting
with
the
exclusive
representative.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
maybe
we
can
try
one
more
approach.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
and
that
is
the
question
of
budget.
the
statute
specifically
says
that
a
public
employer's
budget
is
not
subject
to
meet
and
negotiate;
that
is
no
employee
organization
may
attempt
to
negotiate
over
what
the
size
of
the
budget
shall
be
or
how
the
budget
shall
be
broken
down.
however,
quite
obviously,
when
it
comes
to
negotiating
a
salary
schedule,
how
much
of
the
budget
that
will
go
toward
the
salary
schedule
is
clearly
a
subject
of
meet
and
negotiate.
in
minnesota,
the
subject
of
budget
has
regularly
been
involved
in
meet
and
confer
with
the
exclusive
representative
to
permit
the
majority
representative
to
indicate
to
the
employer
its
views
concerning
the
size
of
the
budget
and
the
utilization
of
the
budget,
but
that
process
is
not
binding
on
the
employer
once
the
employer
has
met
and
conferred
with
the
exclusive
representative.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
that
is
true.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
they
cannot--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--exactly,
your
honor.
they
certainly
may--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--the
state
interest
is
the
same
as
it
is
for
exclusive
representation
and
meet
and
negotiation.
that
is
to
permit
the
employer
to
have
the
majority
view,
to
eliminate
conflicting
demands
by
various
groups
of
employees
upon
the
employer,
to
eliminate
the
tension
between
employees
and--
mr.
eric
r.
miller
--pardon
me?
mr.
eric
r.
miller
yes.
the
state
of
minnesota
has
determined
as
a
matter
of
policy
for
professional
employees
that
it
wants
to
have
the
view
of
the
exclusive
representative
concerning
those
non-negotiable
subjects.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
don't
think
that
the
state
of
minnesota
is
trying
to
eliminate
divergent
views.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
it
is
not.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
in
terms
of
being
able
to
have
an
orderly
constructive
session,
yes,
but
i
understood
the
justice's
question
to
be
whether
or
not
the
state
was
opposed
to
divergent
views
as
a
conceptual
matter.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
in
a
comparable
meeting.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
they
want
to
hear
the
majority
view
on
the
state
budget
in
a
meet
and
confer
session,
that
is
true.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
in
that
session
that
is
right.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
i
want
to
make
myself
hopefully,
finally,
and
forever
very
clear.
an
individual
faculty
member
has
the
first
amendment
right
if
the
individual
administrator
is
willing...
has
the
time,
not
because
of
pelra...
to
hear
out
that
individual
faculty
member
concerning
his
views
on
the
budget.
mr.
eric
r.
miller
the
first
amendment
does
not
guarantee
that
an
employer
shall
listen
and
respond.
the
state
statute
here
does
provide
that
same
level
of
responsibility
just
as
it
does
for
meet
and
negotiate
for
exclusive
representatives.
