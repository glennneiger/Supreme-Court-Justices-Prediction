mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
hope
that
your
honors
will
indulge
me
for
a
moment
if
i
admit
that,
having
heard
mr.
miller's
presentation,
i
am
somewhat
perplexed
about
what
this
litigation
has
involved
over
the
past
several
years.
he
know
takes
the
position
that
no
one
is
being
preventing
from
speaking,
no
one
is
being
prevented
from
listening,
everything
in
minnesota
is
perfectly
free
and
open.
that
is
not
the
reading
of
the
statute
that
the
district
court
obtained.
the
definition
of
meet
and
confer
in
section
179.63,
subdivision
15,
is,
and
i
quote,
"the
exchange
of
views
and
concerns
between
employers
and
their
respective
employees.
"
rather
a
broad
concept.
the
obligation
of
public
employers
in
section
179.66,
subdivision
3,
is
the
obligation
to
meet
and
confer
with
professional
employees
to
discuss
policies
and
those
matters
relating
to
employment
not
included
under
subsection
18
of
179.63.
that
is
the
matters
of
inherent
managerial
policy.
section
179.66,
subdivision
7,
then
tells
the
public
employer
that
if
an
exclusive
representative
has
been
selected,
the
public
employer
shall
not
meet
with
any
person
or
representative
other
than
the
exclusive
representative;
that
is
the
statute
creates
an
expansive
definition
of
meet
and
confer
as
the
exchange
of
views,
obligates
the
public
employer
to
meet
with
public
employees
to
discuss
this
broad
subject
matter.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that
is
right,
sir.
i
believe
if
they
decided
on
their
own
to
set
up
a
policy
in
terms
of
regulation
or
a
practice
in
these
particular
community
colleges,
we
would
have
the
same
first
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
problems.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
legislature
is
creating
a
system
involving
the
administrators
which
is
intended,
or
at
least
has
been
applied...
let
me
not
say
intended,
because
i
believe
there
is
a
way
this
statute
could
have
been
applied
constitutionally
if
the
board
and
the
mccfa
had
chosen
to
do
so.
but,
this
statute
has
enabled
them
to
apply
the
meet
and
confer
process
in
a
systematically
discriminatory
fashion
against
all
non-members
of
the
mccfa
for--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--as
a
matter
purely
of
his
personal
interest
in
the
views
of
this
individual
or
seeking
the
views
of
this
individual
for
the
purpose
of
somehow
effecting
or
influencing
the
exercise
of
his
official
powers?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
yes,
absolutely.
absolutely.
i
think
once
he
opens
up
the
process
of
conferring
to
any
one
of
those
faculty
members,
he
has
an
obligation,
unless
he
can
come
up
with
at
least
a
rationale
distinction
among
them
for
opening
it
up
to
all
of
them.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
equal
protection
clause.
that
is
at
a
minimum
we
have
a
case
where
there
is
discrimination
as
justice
o'connor
has
suggested.
some
faculty
members
are
not
allowed
to
discuss
in
an
attempt
to
influence
the
public
employer's
exercise
of
his
duties
and
this
one
particular--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
i
suppose
it
depends
upon
how
you
define
listen.
if
we
go
back
to
the
pickering
line
of
cases,
it
has
certainly
been
held
that
a
public
employee
has
the
right
to
speak
provided
that
that
speech
does
not
substantially
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
his
own
obligations
and
the
exercise
of
the--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--no,
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
has
told
the
employer
that
the
employer
has
to
listen.
the
statute
has
first
said
in
179.73
that
the
state
of
minnesota
wants
input
from
all
of
its
professional
employees
to
the
employers
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
those
employers
in
performing
their
functions.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
then
we
come
to
the
question
as
whether
that
discrimination
attached
as
an
ex
post
facto
condition
to
the
grant
of
this
right--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--i
wasn't
using
it
in
that
sense.
i
was
using
it
in
after
the
fact,
in
sense
of
the
logical
construction
of
this
statute
was
first
to
set
up
the
concept
of
meet
and
confer
as
the
desideratrum
of
the
legislature
and
then
to
come
on
afterwards
and
say
if
an
exclusive
representative
has
been
selected,
that
representative
will
be
the
meet
and
confer
representative,
because
you
will
notice
the
statute
says
if
an
exclusive
representative
has
not
been
selected,
nevertheless,
meet
and
confer
will
go
forward
through
some
representational
process
not
involving--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
the
discrimination
in
this
case,
as
the
statute
has
been
applied,
is
that
the
only
individuals
among
the
faculty
members
of
the
community
colleges
who
have
been
permitted
to
participate
in
any
manner
whatsoever
in
the
selection
of
meet
and
confer
committees
or
serving
on
the
meet
and
confer
committees
have
been
members
of
the
mccfa.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
we
have
a
policy
justification
for
limiting
the
individuals
who
can
actually
participate
in
the
meet
and
confer
session.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
way
they
were
run.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
mccfa
selected
through
some
internal
procedure
on
the
various
campuses
the
individuals
who
would
participate
in
the
campus
meet
and
confer
committees.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
designates
these
people
as
its
representatives.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that
is
not
the
way
the
act
is
applied
in
minnesota,
no.
of
course,
the
exclusive
representative
is
a
non-human
entity.
it
has
to
have--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
there
is
certainly
a
possibility
whereby
this
statute
could
be
applied
through
the
exclusive
representative.
again
we
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
public
employers
shall
not
meet
and
confer
with
public
employees
except
through
the
exclusive
representative.
it
doesn't
say
only
with
the
exclusive
representative.
they
could
have
applied
this
statute
originally
so
as
to
allow
all
of
the
faculty
members
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
the
members
of
the
meet
and
confer
committees.
in
fact,
prior--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--excuse
me,
ma'am.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
under
the
district
court's
orders
non-members
are
allowed
to
participate
in
the
voting
process
and
they
are
allowed
to
stand
for
election.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir,
they
definitely
challenge
that
remedy.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
historically,
if
one
goes
back,
as
the
district
court
recites
in
its
findings
and
its
opinion,
you
had
a
faculty
government
system
in
these
minnesota
community
colleges
prior
to
the
application
of
pelra's
meet
and
confer
structure
and
that
faculty
government
system
involved
all
of
the
members
of
the
faculty
equally
participating
in
voting,
all
having
an
equal
opportunity
at
least
to
set
themselves
forward
as
candidates.
this
statute,
if
we
can
look
at
it
in
a
practical
sense,
really
in
the
academic
context
codified
that
system.
these
professional
employees
are
now
going
to
have
a
statutory
mechanism
for
meeting
and
conferring
with
their
employers.
we
have
the
same
thing
they
did
prior
to
the
public
employment
relations
act,
discussing
academic
standards,
academic
policies,
the
question
of
inherent
managerial
duties.
but,
the
statute
added
a
new
wrinkle
and
the
new
wrinkle
was
that
this
advantageous
condition,
the
election
of
an
exclusive
representative
for
the
purpose
of
meet
and
negotiate
was
now
going
to,
as
it
has
been
applied
at
least,
block
off
from
participating
in
faculty
governments
one
distinct
class
of
faculty
members.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
we
are
making
no
argument
that
is
inconsistent
with
that
view,
justice
rehnquist.
we
are
not
attacking
the
structure
of
meet
and
confer
in
the
sense
that
it
sets
up
a
regularized
procedure
whereby
individuals
are
chosen
to
serve
on
these
committees.
we
are
saying
that
is
fine.
if
the
state
wants
to
have
such
a
regularized
procedure,
that
is
excellent,
but
at
least
have
all
of
the
professional
employees
in
the
relevant
unit
allowed
to
participate
in
the
selection
of
those
representatives
and
allowed
to
stand
for
election.
the
board
in
this
case
will
meet
with
the
same
number
of
meet
and
confer
committees
as
were
extant
prior
to
the
district
court's
order.
on
the
particular
individual
community
college
campuses,
the
same
meet
and
confer
committees
will
function.
the
only
difference
will
be
the
composition
within
those
committees.
from
the
board's
point
of
view,
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference.
they
are
running
the
system
precisely
the
way
it
has
always
been
run.
they
are
following
the
same
orderly
regularized
procedure.
from
mccfa's
position,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
because
now
people
will
have
a
different
perspective
on
academic
questions,
now
people
whom
the
chief
justice
perhaps
correctly
called
dissidents
in
the
sense
that
they
dissent
from
mccfa's
policies,
now
those
individuals
will
have
some
small
voice
in
the
official
mechanism
of
communication
to
their
employers.
and
that
is
what
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
absolutely
and
to
stand
personally
for
election
if
they
can
receive
sufficient
votes.
that
is
what
we
asked
the
district
court
to
declare
and
that
is
what
the
district
court--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think
the
statute
precludes
that.
i
think
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
not
to
do
that.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
might
very
well
satisfy
me,
but
i
don't
know
how
this
court
or
the
district
court
would
rewrite--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--i
think
it
simply
struck
the
exclusive
representative's
prerogative--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
initially...
recall
initially
all
the
district
court
said
was
that
the
mccfa
had
to
hold
a
selection
process
whereby
all
the
faculty
members
could
participate
equally.
it
was
only
when
the
mccfa
and
the
board
developed
their
so-called
vote-for-six
rule
which
required
an
individual,
if
he
was
voting
for
one
of
the
dissidents,
also
to
vote
for
some
of
the
union
members.
the
court
took
a
second
look
at
this
and
said,
well--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
created
a
remedy
that
maybe
somewhat
extraordinary
in
the
sense
that
we
can't
find
a
direct
precedent
for
it,
but
it
derives
from
the
conduct
that
had
to
be
dealt
with.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
accept
the
proposition
that
the
employer
would
be
burdened
to
the
extent
that
he
has
to
meet
or
it
has
to
meet
with
more
than
one
committee.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
if
he
had
agreed
originally?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
in
the
full
meet
and
confer
sense?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
what
i
mean
is
meet
and
confer
is
this
process
whereby
the
employer
treats
this
input
as
something
more
than
simply
advantageous
statements
from
a
friendly
faculty
member,
but
as
a
view
of
a
group
with
some
recognition.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
and,
if
he
meet
with
these
people--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
on
inherent
managerial
questions.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
i
think
the
order
of
the
district
court
remedies
the
meet
and
confer
problem
that
we
had
which
was
the
inability
of
the
non-union
members
to
participate
in
any
meaningful...
in
any
way
whatsoever
in
the
process.
i
can
live
with
it.
i
can
accept.
they
can
accept.
i
am
certainly
not
here
asking
that
one
go
beyond
that.
i
would
just
point
out
one
thing
with
respect
to
mr.
miller's
emphasis
on
the
fundamentality
of
this
exclusivity
principle
here.
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
as
stated
in
179.73,
is
not
to
obtain
simply
a
majority
view.
it
is
to
obtain
the
view
of
all
of
the
professional
employees.
i
think
this
is
particularly
critical
in
an
academic
setting
where
it
is
quite
clear
that
most
faculty
members
are
chosen
for
their
complementary
to
the
whole,
each
one
fulfilling
hopefully
an
unique
nitch
in
the
system.
it
really
is
not
terribly
rational
to
superimpose
on
that
type
of
a
system
some
majoritarian
theory
of
representation.
and,
that
is
why
the
district
court,
and
i
believe
correctly,
emphasized
the
academic
freedom
nature
of
the
communications
and
issues
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
we
are
not,
as
the
chief
justice,
i
believe,
correctly
emphasized,
dealing
with
wages,
hours,
and
those
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
fall
within
the
meet
and
negotiate
category,
those
more
or
less
fungible
or
in
some
sense
or
other
hopefully
objective
questions.
the
district
court
pointed
out,
again
i
believe
correctly,
that
in
the
area
of
meet
and
confer
you
are
dealing
with
intangible
questions
inherently
and
when
you
are
dealing
in
an
academic
setting
you
are
dealing
with
questions
that
involve
rather
personal
interactions.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
the
first
one
is
the
subject
matter
of
these
two
areas
is
completely
different.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
we
do.
we
appealed
that
question.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
wasn't
argued.
we
didn't
brief
it.
but,
the
subject
matter
is--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
of
course--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--because
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
subject
matter
is
different.
this
court
is
the
source
of
the
distinction
in
first
amendment
jurisprudence
between
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
the
collective
bargaining
trilogy,
and
other
matters.
if
we
go
back
to
the
abood
case,
we
discover
that
for
some
reasons
collective
bargaining
politics
is
different
from
other
forms
of
politics.
all
right.
for
purposes
of
analysis
i
accept
that
kind
of
distinction.
well,
let's
use
it
here.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
greater
distinction
between
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
subject
to
exclusivity
and
discussion
with
a
public
employers,
an
arm
of
government,
over
inherent
managerial
policy
questions.
i
think
if
you
can
say
somehow
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
have
to
be
put
down
here
in
the
scale
in
terms
of
talking
about
their
political
ramifications
and
the
rights
of
individuals
to
be
coerced
into
supporting
that
kind
of
activity,
then
on
the
other
side
you
would
have
to
say
the
inherent
managerial
questions
have
to
be
looked
at
somewhat
more
seriously.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
but,
they
have
chosen.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
the
statute
says--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
if
you
are
getting
to
the
question
of
whether
the
exclusivity
principle
can
be
carried
over,
the
first
problem,
from
my
perspective
in
looking
at
it,
would
be
that
there
is
no
procedural
similarity
in
the
two
situations.
that
is
if
you
accept
the
validity
of
the
concept
of
collective
bargaining
through
exclusivity,
it
does
hinge
ultimately,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
practical
necessity
of
having
one
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
i
think
if
you
carry
that
principle
to
its
logic
of
conclusion,
you
run
into
a
whole
host
of
what
i
would
call
one-man,
one-vote
or
political
equality
cases
and
a
number
of
first
amendment
cases
that
essentially
teach--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
if
they
had
a
rational
work-related
reason
for
consulting
with
particular
employees
about
particular
management
problems,
that
is
one
thing.
we
are
not
attacking
the
concept
that
employers
should
be
allowed
to
talk
with
employees.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
you
one
hundred
percent.
the
employer
is
on
the
other
side.
but,
all
the
people
here,
all
of
the
employees
on
both
sides
are
in
the
same
position
with
respect
to
this
rational
basis
analysis.
all
of
these
employees
are
similarly
situated
with
respect
to
the
employer
in
terms
of
the
usefulness
of
contributing
information
about
their
work
assignments
or
the
managerial
questions
that
come
up
in
the
course
of
the
discussions
that
go
on
in
meet
and
confer.
the
distinction
that
is
being
made
in
this
statute
is
here
we
have
a
private
organizations,
mccfa,
that
has
been
selected
for
this
purpose,
negotiation,
which
concededly
requires
one
separate
negotiating
entity.
and,
carried
over
from
this
we
discover
the
application
of
this
statute
to
preclude
all
the
non-members
from
participating
in
a
scheme
of
communications
in
which
they
all
could
participate
equally
and
did
prior
to
pelra
participate
equally
without
any
necessity
for
having
a
single
private
organization
determine
the
content
of
those
committees.
that
is
why
i
can't
understand
their
complaint
that
somehow
the
result
that
the
district
court
came
up
with
is
an
interference,
number
one,
with
the
meet
and
confer
system,
because
the
meet
and
confer
system
operates
in
essence
the
same
way
it
always
did
with
respect
to
the
employer.
or,
number
two,
that
somehow
it
delegates
from
the
position
of
this
union
as
the
exclusive
representative
with
respect
to
negotiations.
they
are
the
representative
with
negotiations
and
the
meet
and
confer
committees
form
the
same
structure,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
board,
as
they
did
prior
to
the
district
court's
order.
what
is
the
difference?
the
difference
is
the
dissidents
have
come
out
to
say
something
to
their
own
employer
and
to
their
own
government.
that
is
the
difference.
they
have
been
allowed
to
do
the
thing
that
before
pelra
came
into
existence
was
taken
for
granted
as
part
of
the
right
of
an
academic.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
that
is
right.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
you
wouldn't.
i
think
any
enlightened
administrator
running
a
community
college
or
other
system
of
higher
education
would
have
these
interactions
with
the
faculty.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
limits
their
authority
in
terms
of
the
entity
or
individual
with
whom
they
may
have
the
discussion.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
that
is
right,
exactly.
that
discrimination
is
what
the
case
is
all
about.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
all
right.
and,
our
position
is
first,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
there
is
really
no
rational
basis
for
it.
all
these
employees
are
similarly
situated.
why
do
we
have
one
group
excluded
simply
because
they
have
chosen
not
to
join
this
private
organization.
and,
secondarily,
there
is
absolutely
no
interference
in
the
result
that
we
have
obtained
and
are
arguing
for
with
any
part
of
the
statutory--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
because
the
state
gave
this
organization
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
they
are
operating
under
color
of
the
statute,
a;
and,
b,
certainly
the
board
has
been
cooperating
with
them
since
they
began
running
meet
and
confer
this
way.
the
board
is
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
here
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out.
they
are
certainly
not
challenging
mccfa's
application
of
this
statute.
and,
they
could
certainly
do
so.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
no,
but
what
they
could
have
done
to
the
mccfa
was
to
say
to
them
this
statute
does
not
require
you
to
limit
participation
in
these
meet
and
confer
committees
to
your
members
only.
we
are
not
going
to
meet
with
you
until
you
bring
us
a
balanced
committed
or
show
us
that
you
have
tried
to
do
so
and
if
you
don't
like
it,
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
against
us.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
the
statute
and
then
we
might
have
gotten
this
same
result,
but
instead
the
board
turned
around
and
said
we
are
very
happy
with
this,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
meet
with
you
to
the
extent--
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
--well,
it
was
the
mccfa's
claim
that
it
was
entitled
to
select
individuals
from
its
membership
only
based
upon...
it
is
based
upon
179.66,
subdivision
7.
that
is
what
they
have
been
arguing.
they
have
authority
in
directly
there
to
it
because
the
public
employer
can
meet
only
through
them
and
they
are
the
exclusive
representative,
not
as
a
matter
of
private
action.
they
were
designated
as
such
under
the
statute.
that
is
where
they
gained
that
authority.
mr.
edwin
vieira,
jr.
well,
it
was
a
private
decision
acquiesced
by
this
board.
it
was
a
private
decision
taken
under
the
color
of
the
statute.
