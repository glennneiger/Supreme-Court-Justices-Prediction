mr.
david
m.
lascell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
private
college
called
grove
city
college
which
seeks
to
avoid
government
entanglement,
which
seeks
to
remain
independent,
and
which
seeks
to
operate
efficiently,
must
either
expel
students
who
receive
federal
scholarships,
or
must
agree
that
it
is
subject
to
government
regulation.
grove
city
has
never
sought
nor
accepted
any
federal
aid
nor
grants.
it
therefore
declined
to
participate
in
the
beog
program
or
any
other
student
assistance
program
sponsored
by
state
or
federal
governments.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
but
in
terms
of
the
statement
of
the
case,
that
is
the
position
of
the
college.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
the
government
acknowledged,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
grove
city
was
not
participating
in
the
beog
program,
but
it
asked
the
college
to
help
by
supplying
forms
for
students
who
might
be
eligible
to
participator
in
the
beog
program
and
by
certifying
attendance
and
costs
at
the
college
in
order
that
those
students
might
receive
those
awards.
the
government
now
claims
that
what
grove
city
did
means
that
the
college
is
operating
a
program
which
receives
federal
financial
assistance.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case,
nor
has
there
ever
been
any
claim,
that
grove
city
discriminates
in
any
way,
nor
that
it
claims
any
right
to
discriminate.
now,
the
issues
in
the
case
can
be
a
little
confusing,
and
we
have
tried
to
label
them
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
in
three
ways.
first,
we
have
what
we
call
the
recipient
issue,
that
is,
whether
grove
city
operates
a
program
which
receives
federal
financial
assistance
because
some
of
its
students
receive
beog
grants.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
perhaps,
but
certainly
not,
not...
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility,
justice
white,
but
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
in
fact,
that
is
what
happened,
nor
do
i
think
that
that
is
what
could
happen.
in
this
case
the
government
selects
the
students,
the
court
will
recall--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--well,
i
would
be
making
the
same
arguments,
but
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
beog
grant
statute
does
not
contemplate
that
the
students
are
conduits
but
instead
contemplates
that
they
are
ultimate
beneficiaries.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
they
can
use
the
money
for
educational
purposes--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--which
could
include
tuition--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--but
in
this
instance,
the
two
students
who
are
involved
in
this
case
in
fact
did
not
use
that
money
for
tuition.
you
will
recall
that
neither
student
received
that
money
until
well
after
tuition
and
fee
payments
were
due
at
the
college,
and
in
fact,
if
we
closely
examine
the
beog
program,
it
is
very
evident
that
that
money
cannot
come
to
those
students
until
after
they
are
in
attendance
for
the
semester
which
they
receive
the
award
because
the
certification
does
not
occur
until
after
students
begin
classes.
under
those
circumstances,
at
grove
city,
at
least,
the
money
which
the
students
receive
would
not
go
to
the
institution
but
would
be
used
for
other
educational
purposes,
whether
to
repay
loans,
to
take
care
of
housing,
to
buy
books
at
off-campus
stores,
other
educational
purposes
allowed
by
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
these
beog
awards
go
to
students
who
are
picked
by
the
government.
the
amount
of
the
award
is
determined
by
the
government.
and
in
this
instance,
the
award
is
paid
by
the
government
directly
to
the
students
and
not
to
the
college.
that
is
the
first
issue,
the
recipient
issue.
grove
city
claims
that
it
is
not
a
recipient,
and
if
the
court
agrees,
it
does
not
need
to
consider
what
we
have
called
issues
two
and
three.
issue
two
is
the
program
issue.
what
is
the
program
or
activity
to
be
regulated
if
in
fact
grove
city
is
a
recipient?
three
theories
have
been
offered
to
this
court.
one
is
that
the
program
equals
the
institution,
institution-wide
program
at
grove
city
or
any
other
college.
that's
the
government's
historical
position,
and
it
is
the
position
which
was
adopted
by
the
third
circuit.
the
second
position,
the
second
theory
offered
to
this
court
is
the
one
that
grove
city
offers,
that
if
grove
city
is
a
recipient,
the
program
appropriately
to
be
regulated
is
the
beog
program
itself.
the
third
theory
is
a
new
one
which
has
been
offered
to
this
court,
and
that
is
that
the
entire
financial
aid
program
of
a
college
like
grove
city
is
that
which
is
to
be
regulated,
including
any
private
money
which
is
a
part
of
that
financial
aid
program.
that's
the
government's
new
position,
offered
for
the
first
time
to
this
court
and
never
before
offered
to
the
college.
that
is
the
program
issue,
what
we
have
called
the
program
issue.
the
third
issue,
which
again
needs
to
be
considered
only
if
grove
city
is
determined
to
be
a
recipient,
is
what
we
have
called
the
funds
termination
issue:
whether
aid
to
grove
city
students
can
be
terminated
solely
because
grove
city
refused
to
execute
an
assurance
of
compliance
which
the
government
itself
now
says
was
overly
broad
when
it
asked
grove
city
to
execute
it,
but
which
the
government
also
says
now
can
be
saved
by
a
new
interpretation
never
before
offered
to
the
college
and
despite
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
any
claim
of
discrimination
levied
against
this
institution.
those,
therefore,
are
the
three
issues
which
we
seek
to
address,
the
recipient
issue,
the
program
issue,
and
the
funds
termination
issue.
turning
first
to
the
recipient
issue,
whether
or
not
grove
city
is
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance
depends
obviously,
as
this
court
well
knows,
on
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
title
9
talks
about
receiving
federal
financial
assistance
and
operating
a
program
or
activity.
it
is
the
position
of
the
college
that
receive
has
plain
meaning.
it
is
not
a
word
which
any
one
of
us
would
have
difficulty
in
understanding
were
we
not
lawyers
arguing
about
a
case.
receive
has
a
plain
meaning,
and
to
the
public
and
the
country
receive
means
to
consciously
participate,
and
to
receive,
to
obtain
funds.
grove
city
does
not
do
that.
in
fact,
it
consciously
has
chosen
not
to
participate
in
any
federal
aid
program
of
any
kind,
despite
the
fact
that
those--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--only
here,
justice,
because
i
think
that
the
grant
program
contemplates
some
deliberate
action
on
the
part
of
the
college.
i
don't
disagree
that
a
legatee
could
receive
something
without
doing
anything
except
being
there.
but
in
this
instance,
i
think
that
the
scope
of
the
grant
statute
itself
contemplates
some
activity.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
none
of
which
i
am
aware.
i
do
not--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
discrimination,
though,
for
any
protected
class.
i
think
that
the
college
could
say
we
choose
to
accept
only
those
students
who
take
no
federal
aid
programs.
the
difficulty
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
of
the
college
does
that,
what
it
would
be
doing
would
be
to
discriminate
in
one
way,
maybe
not
in
a
protected
way,
but
discriminate
in
one
way
against
those
students
who
in
fact
the
congress
chose
to
help
by
these
aid
programs,
and
certainly
in
this
instance,
those
students
might
include
minorities,
particularly
poor
minorities
who
would
be
unable
to
attend
a
college
like
grove
city
even...
i'm
sorry,
without
these
kinds
of
aid
programs.
that
seems
anomalous
to
us
because
the
congress
clearly
intended
with
these
aid
programs
to
aid
such
students.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
there
is
very
little
in
the
record
about
that.
grove
city
has
been,
justice
o'connor,
co-educational
since
its
founding,
as
the
court
knows.
at
the
time
that
this
case
arose,
140
of
about
its
200...
2200
students,
received
beog
awards
under
this
alternate
disbursal
system.
there
is,
however,
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
the
proportion
by
which
those
students
were
divided,
whether
by
sex,
by
minority,
by
race,
by
religion,
by
anything
else.
don't
forget
that
that...
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
government
chooses
those
students;
grove
city
does
not.
grove
city
simply
takes
the
students
who
were
there
are
allows
them
to
attend
once
they
have
received
those
awards.
the
other
important
point,
i
think,
about
grove
city
which
we
should
say
and
which
should
be
clear
and
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
is
that
its
efficiency
and
operation
has
resulted
in
very
high
quality
educational
programs
at
very
low
cost.
its
tuition
fee,
room
and
board
costs
at
the
time
that
this
case
arose
were
just
over
$4000
per
year,
not
per
semester
as
all
of
us
are
accustomed
to
seeing
at
high
quality
private,
independent
universities
and
colleges
in
this
country.
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
has
been
able
to
do
that
has
been
because
of
its
refusal
to
be
entangled
with
any
kind
of
government
authority,
and
at
the
same
time,
its
refusal
as
a
part
of
its
conscience
and
heritage,
to
discriminate
against
any
class
of
people
who
wish
to
attend
that
institution.
that
is
something
of
which
the
college
is
very
proud,
and
rightfully
so,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
the
recipient
issue
is
one
which
we
find
very
difficult.
the
court
will
recall
that
at
the
time
title
9
was
enacted,
there
were
in
fact
three
pieces
of
legislation
before
the
congress,
one
a
proposal
from
senator
bayh,
one
a
proposal
from
congresswoman
greene,
and
one,
an
administrative
proposal,
and
the
congress
made
a
conscious
choice
about
which
of
those
proposals
it
chose
to
accept.
the
position
of
the
college
is
that
the
proposal
which
it
chose
to
accept
is
one
which
includes
a
definition
of
receive
which
does
not
encompass
this
college
operating
in
this
way.
the
congress
did
not
say
in
that
statute
receive
or
benefit
or
assist.
it
said
receive.
it
is
only
the
regulations
which
expanded
that
receipt
concept
to
benefit
or
to
assistance.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
we
agree
entirely,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
i
agree
entirely.
title
9
was
a
part
of
the
education
act's...
education
act
of
1972.
there
were
20
parts
to
that
act.
those
parts
included
such
things
as
library
grants,
as
continuing
education
programs,
establishment
of
a
national
institute
of
educaton,
and
among
the
other
17
which
were
remaining,
both
title
9
and
the
federal
financial
assistance
program
about
which
we
are
talking.
now,
the
beog
program
was
just
one
small
part
of
that
federal
financial
assistance
program.
there
were,
as
the
court
will
recall,
several
other
parts
to
that.
the
statutory
language,
the
college
would
agree,
should
be
given
as
broad
a
scope
as
possible
under
the
circumstances.
it
is
remedial
legislation.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
yes.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
i
believe
that
that
was
the
choice
which
the
congress
made.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
well,
i
think
that
senator
humphrey's
statements
related
to
title
6,
and
i
think
that
they
also
related
later
to
the
proposal
which
senator
bayh
made
in
1971,
and
the
court
will
recall
that
between
1971
and
1972
when
the
legislation
was
enacted,
there
was
a
dramatic
change
in
what
was
proposed
as
title
9.
the
'71
version,
for
instance,
applied
only
to
public
schools
and
to
private
graduate
programs,
and
we
know
that
in
the
'72
version
which
was
eventually
enacted,
both
those
circumstances
were
eliminated
in
1972.
we
also
know
that
the
administrative
proposal,
the
administration
proposal,
and
the
proposal
from
representative
greene,
were
different
than
that
which
senator
bayh
had
proposed
in
1971.
we
read
that
legislative
history
as
very
confusing.
it
was
interesting
to
me
as
i
reread
the
briefs
this
weekend,
to
see
that
every
one
of
us,
both
amici...
every
amici
and
every
litigant,
cited
that
legislative
history
from
senator
bayh
as
supportive
of
our
own
positions.
now,
that
means
to
me,
justice
o'connor,
that
really
the
only
thing
that
we
can
examine
which
shows
any
clear
change
or
distinction
is
the
differences,
or
are
the
differences
between
the
'71
legislation
and
the
'72
legislation
which
was
enacted.
and
it
is
the
college's
position
that
in
that
change
it
became
as
clear
as
we
can
hope
that
recipient
under
these
circumstances
did
not
mean
beneficiary
or
did
not
mean...
did
not
mean
benefit
or
did
not
mean
assistance.
we
do
not
believe,
by
the
way,
that
that
interpretation
of
the
statute
means
that
discrimination
will
affect
american
higher
education
in
ways
that
would
be
entirely
improper,
nor
do
we
believe
that
that
means
the
end
of
title
9
enforcement.
we
simply
do
not
think
that
that's
correct.
this
court
acknowledged
in
north
haven
the
finch
reading
of
infection,
it
has
done
so
before,
and
that
is
the
position
with
which
this
college
agrees.
this
college
does
not
discriminate
and
does
not
think
that
other
colleges
should,
and
thinks
that
if
a
program
is
infected
by
discriminatory
practices,
then
the
assistance
to
the
federally
funded
program
can
and
should
be
terminated.
that
is
a
position
which
we
will
advocate
for
the
remainder
of
the
life
of
this
college.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
and
wells,
your
honor.
i
say
that
dear
to
my
heart.
i
chair
the
board
of
a
women's
college
so
that
this
is
an
argument
about
which
i
have
some
great
personal
concern.
i
think
if
the
government
prevails
here
in
this
case,
that
the
effect...
that
there
will
be
no
effect
on
women's
undergraduate
institutions.
the
court
will
of
course
recall
that
title
9
exempts
that.
private,
single-sex
institutions
are
exempt
from
the
enforcement
provisions
of
title
9
currently,
and
i
believe
as
well
that
with
a
narrow
reading
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
mississippi
college
case,
that
that
can
continue,
so
that
i
don't
see
that
that
will
be
a
problem
here.
what
i
think
is
important,
and
what
i
think
congress
did
when
it
enacted
title
9,
was
to
balance
two
very
important
concerns,
exceptionally
important;
one,
to
prevent
gender
discrimination
in
post-secondary
education
in
the
united
states;
and
at
the
same
time,
by
very
carefully
constructing
that
education
act
of
1972,
by
attempting
to
preserve
diversity
in
american
higher
education.
not
everyone,
justice
blackmun,
would
think
that
a
single-sex
college
is
appropriate.
not
everyone
would
think
that
what
grove
city
believes
is
appropriate.
but
the
significance
of
those
events,
the
significance
of
that
diversity
in
american
higher
education
i
believe
is
what
congress
carefully
chose
to
do
as
it
balanced
those
interests
in
1972.
the
second
issue,
of
course,
if
the
court
determines
that
grove
city
is
a
recipient,
is
the
program
specificity
issue.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
yes,
i
do,
as
it
is
applied.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
the
second
issue
is
the
program
specificity
issue.
there
are,
as
i
mentioned
in
the
beginning,
three
theories
which
have
been
propounded
to
the
court,
one,
that
the
program
equals
the
institution;
second,
that
the
program
is
the
beog
program
itself;
and
third,
the
new
government
position
that
the
entire
financial
aid
program,
including
private
money,
is
the
program
which
is
to
be
regulated
if
grove
city
is
a
recipient.
the
program,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
our
examination
of
title
9
and
from
the
contemporaneous
history
and
from
the
statements
of
the
commentators,
the
program
is
defined
and
limited
by
the
purpose
of
the
underlying
grant
statute.
that
is
what
determines
what
is
to
be
regulated.
and
i
think
that
we
find
support
in
that
if
we
examine
the
funds
termination
provision.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
funds
termination
provision
includes
a
section
which
says
that
before
funds
can
be
terminated,
the
committee,
the
congressional
committee
having
responsibility
for
the
program
must
be
notified
of
that
proposed
termination.
we
think
that
that
linkage
is
significant.
the
committee
having
responsibility
must
be
notified
in
order
for
the
program
funds
to
be
terminated.
we
think
that
the
statute
and
this
court's
interpretation
in
north
haven
mean
that
the
program
itself
is
to
be
regulated,
and
that
the
program
is
defined
by
the
grant
statute
involved.
here
the
grant
statute
is
the
beog
program
statute,
and
it
is
therefore
the
college's
position
that
it
is
that
program
which
is
to
be
regulated.
the
third
issue
is
the
funds
termination
issue.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that
if
the
college,
justice...
i'm
sorry,
if
the
court
determines
that
grove
city
college
is
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--then
the
program
which
is
appropriately
regulated
is
only
the
beog
program.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
and
therefore
that
the
regulations
and
the
enforcement
of
the
regulations
which
the
government
propounds
which
says
that
that
entire
college
is
to
be
regulated,
is
incorrect.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
i
would
say
that--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--that's
correct.
if
there
were
a
program
specific
assurance
of
compliance
correctly
drafted,
which
we
say
that
the
one
involved
in
this
case
is
not,
then
the
college
could
be
required
to
execute
that
with
respect
to
its
operation--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--i
think
that's
correct.
that's
the
first
time,
of
course,
that
that
has
been
said
as
we
came
through
the
third
circuit--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
exactly
correct.
the
third
issue
is
the
funds
termination
issue.
the
claim
of
the
government
is
that
it
can
terminate
the
funds
of
these
students
even
though
grove
city
doesn't
discriminate
and
even
though
there
is
this
overly
admittedly
broad,
or
admittedly
overly
broad
assurance
of
compliance.
the
position
of
the
college
is
that
that
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
beneficiaries
of
this
grant
statute.
there
has
never
been
a
claim
of
discrimination
here.
there
is
an
admittedly
overly
broad
assurance
of
compliance,
and
yet
the
government
still
claims
a
right
to
terminate
this
assistance.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
i
think
that
the
contemplation
of
the
congress
has
been
that
funds
termination
is
to
be
exercised
only
as
a
last
resort.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
a
last
remedy.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
well,
i
don't
think
what
the
court
has
just
suggested
to
me
is
the
last
resort.
there
could
be
a
proceeding
before
that--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--then
the
answer
to
the
question
is
yes.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
no,
if
it
were
a
last
resort
which
the
court
has
now
suggested
in
its
hypothetical,
then
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate,
after
the
other
proceedings
have
been
exhausted.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
reserve
some
time
for
more
questions.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
well,
i
hope
that
you
won't
because
i
think
it's
unfair
to
the
students
who
are
involved
here.
[laughter]
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
they
are
absolutely
intertwined
and
interrelated.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
just
one
short
comment,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
remain
confused
about
the
government's
position
with
respect
to
these
regulations.
i
thought
that
i
had
understood
it
before
this
argument,
but
i
am
not
certain
that
i
do
once
again.
it
is
clear,
justice
stevens,
that
the
assurance
of
compliance
which
this
college
was
asked
to
execute
did
more
than
simply
say
we
will
agree
to
abide
by
title
9
to
the
extent
that
it
applies
to
us.
the
government's
consistent
position
has
been
that
that
assurance
of
compliance
is
not
only
institutionwide
but
contractually
binds
that
institution,
justice
white,
forever
and
ever
to
the
federal
government.
it
is
that
with
which
this
college
disagrees.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
and
what
will
they
say
tomorrow?
mr.
david
m.
lascell
the
only
certificate
is
in...
the
only
assurance
of
compliance
ever
propounded
is
in
the
record,
yes.
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that
is
only
a
part
of
their
brief
and
what
we
have
heard
here
this
morning.
we
suggest,
however,
that
this
court
should
not
interpret
these
regulations,
that
these
regulations
are
operating
in
a
very
sensitive
area,
and
that
they
ought
to
be
clearly
stated
and
clearly
understood
so
that
those
colleges
like
grove
city
can
operate
at
something
less
than
peril.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
there
were...
this
was
in
the
education
act
of
1972.
it
was
a
whole
grant
statute...
it
was
a
whole
education
amendment
statute.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
no.
title
9
was
a
part
of
that,
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct.
the
initial
title
9
was
a
part
of
that.
it
was
amended
in
1976.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
title
9.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
the
grant
statute
was
extended
during
the
life
of
the
beog
awards.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
yes,
yes.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
this
whole
proposition.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
yes.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
well,
it
was
known
in
1975
when
there
were
some
studies
done
of
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
no,
no,
that
has
not
occurred.
the
regulations
have
not
been
examined
since
1975,
and--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--it
has
been
extended,
but
the
regulations--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--yes.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
with
the
meaning
that
the
agency
has
been
giving
to
it
since
1975,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
i
think
it
is,
at
best,
post-enactment
legislative
history,
and
i
am
very
uncomfortable
suggesting
to
the
court
just
what
that
means
in
this
instance.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
oh,
yes,
i
don't
disagree
with
that
because
as
this--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--well,
two
invalidated--
[laughter]
we
have
two
invalidated
procedures
here,
of
course.
we
not
only
have
the
procedure
which
this
court
invalidated--
mr.
david
m.
lascell
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
in
1975,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
lascell
that's
also
correct.
and
that,
of
course,
is
what
this
court
examined
in
north
haven.
we
do
not
think
that
precisely
the
same
issues
are
involved
in
this
instance
as
were
in
north
haven,
but
we
recognize
that
as
a
problem.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
