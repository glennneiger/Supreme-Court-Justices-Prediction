mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
grove
city
college
does
conduct
an
education
program
or
activity
that
receives
federal
financial
assistance
within
the
meaning
of
title
9.
title
9
doesn't
say
that
the
college
has
to
receive
funds.
it
says
it
has
to
conduct
a
program
that
receives
financial
assistance.
the
purpose
of
title
9
is
to
assure
that
education
programs
that
are
subsidized
by
federal
money
will
not
discriminate.
we
think
that
the
government's
beog
grants,
whether
they
funnel
through
the
college
or
whether
they
go
directly
to
the
students,
directly
and
unequivocally
subsidize
a
financial
aid
program
and
scholarship
program
at
grove
city.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
the
money
that
goes
out
is
like
social
security
funds
or
some
other
kind
of
totally
un...
not
directed,
that
is,
not...
it's
purpose
is
not
to
subsidize
a
feature
of
the
educational
program,
we
would
think
that
it
would
be
rather
difficult,
although
there
might
be
close
cases,
mr.
chief
justice,
depending
on
the
situation.
there
are
complicated
or
mixed
cases.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
social
security
recipient...
just
because
a
social
security
recipient
goes
to
college
would
not
mean
that
the
college
is
receiving
federal
financial
assistance.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very...
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
covered.
the
big
thing
about
the
beog
program--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
are
talking
about
a
mix
of
result
and
purpose.
the
purpose
of
the
beog
program
is
to
subsidize
something
that
colleges
are
in
the
business
of
doing,
which
is
to
provide
financial
aid
in
order
to
better
improve
their
admissions
program.
it
is...
it
is
as
conventional
a
feature
of
an
educational
enterprise
to
have
a
scholarship
program
as
it
is
to
have
an
athletic
program--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
the
social
security
money
that
the
federal
government
is
sending
out
does
not
have
as
a
constituent
purpose
the
purpose
of
subsidizing
an
educational
program.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
may
have
that
economic
effect.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
but,
your
honor,
the
difficulty
is
that
if
we...
if
we
interpret--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--if
we
interpret
this
statute
as
encompassing
the
ripple
effects
of
every
federal
intervention
in
the
economy,
the
statute
will
go
way
beyond
what
congress
was
contemplating
as
to
some
extent.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
we
can
walk
the
plank
here
on
a
middle
line.
we
can
say
that
this
statute,
title
9,
which
as
justice
o'connor
said
was
enacted
in
the
content
of
congress'
creating
the
beog
program
at
a
time
when
congress,
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
was
extremely
concerned
about
discrimination
in
the
provision
of
financial
aid
and
scholarships,
that
was
not
a
marginal
concern.
that
was
a
central
concern.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
we
cannot
go
that
far.
that
is,
we
cannot
say
that
every
time
the
federal
government
gives
somebody
money
and
that
person
buys
something
with
that
money,
that
that
is
financial
assistance
to
the
vendor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
key
limiting
conception
here
must
be
whether
the
federal
money
subsidizes
a
program
and
is
designed
to
subsidize
a
program
that
is
a
part,
that
is
designed
to
aid
that
program.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
it
is...
if
the
federal
government
gives
scholarship
money
to
dependent
children--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--if
the
money
is
restricted
so
that
it
must
be
used
for
purposes
of
an
education,
then
we
think
it
is
assistance
to
the
educational
institution.
justice
white,
i
think
that
grove
city
way
overstates
its
distance
from
this
program,
even
though
the
program
is
channelled
to
the
students.
to
read
to--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--no.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
justice
white's
question
i
think
hypothesized
a
variant
of
aid
to
dependent
children
that
is
earmarked
for
spending
that
money--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--if
it
is
totally
unrestricted
money--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--but
that
distinguishes
it
from
beogs.
that
is
really
the
point
i
was
about
to
make.
it
is
not
the
case,
as
grove
city
seems
to
be
saying,
that
the
federal
government
just
sends
this
money
out
and
the
students
are
free
to
do
whatever
they
want
with
it.
the
purpose
of
these
grants
is
to
finance
students'
education
at
grove
city.
the
amount
is
measured
by
the
cost
of
education,
tuition,
food,
lodging,
books.
the
federal
government
limits
the
amount,
but
the
cost
is
figured
on
the
basis
of
the
actual
expenses
at
the
actual
college.
if
the
student
just
takes
this
money
off
and...
grove
city
has
to
certify
that
this
student
is
a
student
at
grove
city.
it
is
not
really
quite
accurate
to
say
that
the
federal
government
chooses
the
students.
the
students
have
to
be
admitted
to
grove
city.
that
is
the
relevant
population.
that
is,
the
federal
government
cannot
say
we
are
hurling
a
student
at
you.
the
admissions
program
is
run
by
grove
city.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
about
grove
city's
admission
in
this
case,
and
we
do
respect
their
sincerity
in
saying
that
they
want
to
stay
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
federal
government,
and
they
say
it
is
harsh
and
unfair
that
we
who
do
not
want
federal
aid
have
to
be
engulfed
in
this
federal
embrace
just
because
our
students
show
up
here
with
federal
dollars
in
their
pockets.
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
quite
easy
for
grove
city
to
stay
out
of
the
federal
embrace.
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
say
to
their
students,
don't
take
federal
scholarship
money;
we
will
give
you
our
scholarship
money.
that's
exactly
what
they
would
have
had
to
do
before
'72
when
there
was
federal
scholarship
money.
they
would
have
had
to
go
to
their
own
alumni
and
support
groups--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
it
certainly
would
not
be
if
it
gave
equivalent
scholarship
aid
of
its
own.
if
it
didn't
have
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
understand.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
it
has
got
to
be
our
position
and
is
our
position
that
the
college
must
be
free
to
opt
out
in
that
way.
it
must
be
free
to
opt
out
in
that
way.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
it
isn't
really
that
we
are
expelling
the
students.
we
are
saying
that
grove
city
is
free
to
go
back
to
the
pre-federal
aid
days,
which
is
exactly
where
it
says
it
wants
to
be.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
prior
to
'72
grove
city
was
in
a
position
in
which
if
a
student
couldn't
get
private
scholarship
aid,
there
wasn't
any
government
aid,
you
couldn't
come
to
college.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
is
true,
it
has
that
effect,
that
the
student
either
has
to
find
scholarship
money
elsewhere
or
go
to
a
different
college.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
it
does
not
seem
unfair
to
us
in
light
of
what
we
are
asking
grove
city
to
do.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
we
are
asking
grove
city
to
certify
that
it
is
not
discriminating
in
its
scholarship
program.
now,
that
seems
to
us
not
to
be
a
harsh
quid
pro
quo
in
return
for
the
federal
government
subsidy
of
that
program.
now,
if
grove
city
does
not
want
to
be
harsh
to
its
students,
it
can
go
to
private
sector
and
raise
its
own
scholarship
money.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
assurance
of
compliance
simply
asks
the
college
to
say
that
insofar
as
the
law
is
applicable,
we
assure
that
we
will
comply
with
it.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
position
is...
and
this
leads
us
to
the
second
branch
of
this
case...
that
the
coverage
of
grove
city's
financial
aid
and
scholarship
program,
including
its
own,
does
not
automatically
trigger
college-wide
coverage.
it
is
at
that
stage
of
our
submission
that
we
try
to
meet
congress'
other
purpose
in
this
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
we
think
that
this
court
should
do
here
exactly
what
it
did
in
north
haven,
and
which
is
what
the
government
is
doing.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
to
construe
it
according
to
its
terms.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
our
position
has
not
been
a
monolith.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
are
not
defending
the
regulation
in
its
broadest
possible
reading.
we
are
defending
the
regulation
as
we
think
it
ought
to
be
read
in
light
of
this
court's
language
in
north
haven,
and
we
are
really
doing
exactly
what
the
court
itself
did
in
north
haven,
which
is
to
say
to
read
this
regulation
not
in
order
to
render
it
invalid,
but
to
render
it
valid
in
light
of
the
court's
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
agency's
position--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--historically,
the
agency's
position
for
a
certain
time
in
the
mid-'70s
was
that
financial
aid
triggers
collegewide
coverage.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
that
was
a
'75-'76
construction.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
right.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
was
before
this
court's
opinion
in
north
haven.
but
i
don't
want
to
quibble
with
you,
justice
white,
there
has
been
here
a
restudy
and
a
reconsideration
of
this
matter.
what
led
us
to
that,
i
think,
is
exactly
what
led
the
court
to
its
language
in
north
haven
which
is
that
the
contrary
position,
that
is,
that
if
one
student
with
one
dollar
of
beog
money
shows
up
at
this
college,
that
triggers
collegewide
coverage.
the
difficulty
with
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--we
think
that
the
entire
scholarship
and
grant
program
of
the
college
is
covered.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
any
way
in
dispensing
scholarship
aid.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
would
also
be
covered.
hiring,
of
course,
would
be
covered
independently
on
a
non-program
specific
basis
in
any
event
because
title
7
applies.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
your
honor,
we,
we...
uncomfortable
as
it
is,
our
position
is
that
the--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
money
does
not
follow
the
student
around
to
every
activity
the
student
engages
in.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
our
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
the
central
question
to
ask
is
what
program
does
the
federal
government
subsidize
here?
now,
we
think
the
program
is
the
scholarship
program
and
not
the
math
department
and
the
athletic
department.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
practical
terms,
if
i
am
trying
to
limit--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--the
federal
coverage
as
much
as
possible--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
would
execute
the
assurance
of
the
compliance
and
insist
that
the
federal
regulatory
intervention
be
limited
to
investigations
of
the
scholarship
and
financial
aid
program.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
also,
i
should
add,
just
to
complete
the
statement
of
the
government's
position,
that
it
is
also
the
government's
position
that
presumptively,
at
least,
discrimination
in
admissions
is
a
form
of
discrimination
that
infects
all
of
the
activities
of
the
college
so
that
wherever
federal
aid
goes,
discrimination
in
admissions--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--looking
only
at
title
9,
our
position
is,
as
the
court
said
in
north
haven,
that
title
9
deals
with
employment
discrimination
only
on
the
same
program-specific
basis.
but
that
problem
is
dissolved
by
the
fact
that
grove
city,
whoever
wins
this
case,
is
in
any
event
covered
by
title
7
and
may
not
in
any
way
discriminate
in
its
employment.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
effect,
our
position
is
that
unless
congress
has--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--yes.
your
honor,
that
has
a
special
application
in
the
case
of
grove
city
and
private
undergraduate
colleges.
that
is,
the
government's
position
is
that
unless
the
statute
explicitly
exempts
admissions
from
title
9,
discrimination
in
admissions
infects
the
entire
operation.
now,
it
happens
that
private
undergraduate
colleges
are
explicitly
exempted
in
their
admissions
so
that
grove
city
does
not
have
to,
as
it
were,
is
not
swept
up
in
this
aspect
of
the
government's
position.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
in
a
sense,
empirically
it
is
a
discrimination,
but
we
are
caught
here
in
this
dilemma,
that
it's
the
kind
of
discrimination
that
existed
before
the
federal
government
created
this
program.
that
is,
you
either
got
private
scholarship
money,
or
if
you
couldn't
afford
it,
you
couldn't
go.
now,
the
federal
government
has
come
into
this
situation
with
this
special
kind
of
statute
provision
that
says
we
will
held
finance
scholarship
aid
for
you,
but
what
we
want
in
return
is
an
assurance
that
you
do
not
put
your
scholarship
program
on
a
discriminatory
basis.
now,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
a
harsh
or
terrible
thing.
in
fact,
we
are
being
cudgeled
also
on
the
ground
that
that
doesn't
go
far
enough
because
we
are
being
told
that
that
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
discrimination
in
other
parts
of
the
college,
and
many
of
the
amici
asked
the
question,
well,
how
can
it
be
that
congress
would
have
wished
a
student
with
federal
money
to
show
up
in
a
college
which
discriminates
in
certain
of
its
parts?
and
i
think
our
answer
to
that
must
be,
your
honor,
that
congress
in
'72
was
not
thinking
of
this
statute
as
whether
you
are
for
or
against
discrimination.
it
seems
to
me
we
must
say
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
opposed
discrimination
in
all
its
forms,
but--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
as
the
'72
and
'71--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
your
honor,
even
with
respect
to
the
dispensing
of
federal
aid,
if
the
college's
certification
of
students,
if
it
used
a...
i
mean,
this
would
be
a
sinister
case--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--but
if
the
college
in
its
certification
of
the
question
whether
the
student
is
in
good
standing,
if
it
used
different
rules
for
men
and
women,
that
would
affect
even
the
federal
program.
but
what
is
really
at
issue
here
is
what
congress
found
historically
to
have
been
occurring
at
universities
prior
to
'71
and
'72.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
men
students
get
more
scholarship
aid
than
women
students--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
would
be
covered.
that
is,
athletic
scholarships
cannot
be
a
device
for
favoring
men
over
women.
that
is
clearly
a
part
of
our
submission?
and
congress
in
'71
and
'72
found
that
one
of
the
major
problems
of
discrimination
in
american
education
was
that
men
were
getting
higher
scholarships
and
better
financial
aid
than
women,
and
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
end.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
regulations
as
currently
construed
and
as
we
understand
we
would
enforce
them
are
all
valid.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
that
is
our
submission.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
regulations
have
this
funny
circularity
in
them
in
that
they
say...
in
effect,
they
say
this
regulation
applies
insofar
as
it
is
valid.
that's
built
into
the
regulation.
so
there
is,
if
you
will,
a
circularity
in
the
regulation
that
permits
some--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--right.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
regulation
says
that
grove
city
must
comply
with
title
9
insofar
as
it
applies.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
no,
no.
[laughter]
that's
the
pithy
way
of
putting
it.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
there
is
a
part
of
it
which
the
court
has
to
reach
in
view
of
grove
city's
argument.
it
is
the
case
that
we
in
our
opposition
said
that
the
court
does
not
necessarily
have
to
define
the
relevant
program,
if
grove
city
is
a
recipient,
it
doesn't
have
to
completely
answer
the
question
of
the
relevant
program.
i
think
the
court
does
have
to
at
least
say
that
there
is
a
relevant
program
that
is
receiving
federal
financial
assistance,
so
the
court
does
at
least
have
to
say
that
the
financial
aid
program
or
some
part
of
it
is
a
relevant
program.
the
court
does
not
have
to
go
on
and
say
whether
there
is
broader
spillover
coverage
in
this
case.
we
felt
after
our
opposition
the
court
did
grant
cert,
and
one
of
the
questions
presented
was
this
question
of
the
relevant
program.
so
we
did
feel
duty-bound
to
brief
and
indicate
what
the
government's
enforcement
philosophy
with
respect
to
grove
city
would
be.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
in
effect,
if
you
read
the
compliance
certificate
that
was
offered
to
them,
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
that
in
effect
is
what
it
says.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
is
really
all
that
is
at
stake
here.
they
took
the
position,
and
they
have
a
little
bit,
i
think,
put
a
slightly
different--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--they
certainly
were
unwilling
to
sign
it
when
they
thought
that
the
government's
interpretation
of
that
would
be
that
it
would
lead
to
institutionwide
coverage.
your
honor,
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
not
willing
to
live
with
the
proposition
that
only
the
federally
financed
beog
program
is
the
relevant
program.
actually,
in
their
brief
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioners
here
have
argued
that
there
is
no
relevant
program
at
grove
city,
that
it
is
not
conducting
any
program.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
no,
even
on
the
program
specificity
point,
they
are
saying
there
is
no,
no
relevant
program.
that
is
why
that
is
an
interesting
feature
of
this
case,
your
honors,
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
grove
city
came
into
this
court
more
or
less
saying
its
all
or
nothing:
there
is
either
no
program
or
the
whole
college
is
the
program.
now,
that
then
led
them
to
diametrically
opposite
conclusions.
grove
city
said
it's
got
to
be
nothing
because
if
it's
all,
that
destroys
program
specificity.
the
court
of
appeals
said
it's
got
to
be
all
because
if
it's
nothing,
it
leads
to
this
weird
conclusion
that
the
broader
the
grant,
the
less
the
coverage.
now,
it
is
that
dilemma
that
the
government
seeks
to
dissolve
by
attacking
its
premise,
which
is
that
it's
got
to
be
all
or
nothing.
i
want
to
go
back
to
what
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
in
my
thinking
and
emotions
about
this
case,
is
a
difficult
point.
it
is
the
one
that
i
was
led
to
by
justice
powell's
questions,
which
is
how
can
we
suppose
that
congress
created
a
statute
which
would
permit
discrimination
to
continue
in
some
part
of
an
institution
which
had
students
with
federal
scholarships?
our
answer
to
that
is
that
although
congress
was
opposed
to
discrimination
in
all
its
forms,
what
congress
was
thinking
about
in
'72
was
not
whether
to
be
for
or
against
discrimination
in
the
abstract,
but
bow
broad
a
federal
regulatory
intervention
should
be
authorized,
because
regulation
is...
always
has
an
element
of
overkill
and
overenforcement.
and
what
congress
decided
in
that
statute...
and
there
was
a
very
definite
shift
from
'71
which
was
institutionwide,
to
'72,
congress
decided
in
'72
that
the
regulatory
intervention
should
be
this
more
surgical
intervention.
now--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--i
think,
your
honor,
they
were
worried
about
that,
but
they
were
also
worried
about
the
breadth
of
intervention
on
the
court
of
appeals
theory
of
this
case,
which
is
a
dollar
of
federal
aid
anywhere
sets
up
this
economic
ripple
effect
and
leads
to
regulation
on
a
pervasive
basis.
and
we
think
that
congress,
the
size
of
the
gap
that
is
left
by
the
government's
theory
should
not
be
overstated
because
subsidized
programs
are
covered,
we
think
admissions
are
covered
unless
explicitly
exempted.
congress
had
in
mind,
too,
that
there
are
other
laws
in
play
here,
title
7,
the
constitution
is
in
play
in
the
case
of
public
institutions,
as
we
learned
from
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
the
mississippi
nursing
case,
state
law
is
in
play,
and
there
are
fundamental
ethical
laws
here
that
are
in
play
that
for
some
of
us,
i
hope
a
lot
of
us,
mean
that
we
don't
discriminate,
whatever
the
statute
says.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
reconcile
a
complex
assortment
of
purposes.
congress
wanted
to
end
discrimination
in
the
handing
out
of
financial
aid.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
think
we
think
that
if
the
college
benefits
in
the
sense
of
this
subsidy,
that
it
has
to
do
more
than
just
refrain
from
the
formality
of
an
application.
it
is
really
required
to
undergo
a
greater
abnegation
here.
it
is
required,
in
effect,
i
think
it
is
required
to
go
to
its
own
supporters
and
to
put
its
own
money
where
its
mouth
is,
which
is
to
raise
private
scholarship
funds.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
in
terms
of
the
cash
economic
effects.
we
don't
think
that
it
counts
as
federal
assistance
to
an
educational
program
or
activity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
was,
as
far
as...
there
were
amendments
which
excluded
certain
categories
of
activity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
beog
legislation?
i'm
not
on
absolutely
certain
grounds
on
that,
but
i
assume
that
that
has
been
re-enacted
from
time
to
time,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think
that
from
the
beginning
the
department
has
assumed
that
all
beog
grants,
whether
direct
or
this
alternative
system,
do
trigger
title
9
enforcement.
that
has
been
a...
on
that
one
at
least
we
have
been
consistent,
justice
white.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
on
their...
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--your
honor,
the
statute,
title
9--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--very
carefully
spells
out
the
rules
of
the
game
on
when
undergraduate
institutions
and
graduate
institutions
may
continue
to
be
unisex
institutions.
it
says
that
private
undergraduate
institutions,
as
far
as
this
statute
goes,
may
continue
to
be
unisex
institutions.
public
undergraduate
institutions
have
this
rather
more
ambiguous
formula
that
their
admissions
may
be
restricted
to
one
sex
if
there
is
a
tradition
of
one
sex
attendance
at
that
school,
and
that,
of
course,
was
the
statute
that
created
the
statutory
and
of
course
constitutional
problem
in
the
mississippi
nursing.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
graduate
schools
cannot,
if
they
get
any
kind
of
federal
aid
under
title
9,
whether
private
or
public,
graduate
schools
may
not
continue
to
be
unisex
colleges.
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
