unknown
speaker
but
that
assumes
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case,
that
you
have
never
received
any
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
that's
the
position.
unknown
speaker
they
use
the
money
to
pay
their
tuition?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if,
even
if
the
students
were
just
conduits
through
which
tuition
money
passed.
unknown
speaker
that
they
could
use
the
money
for
anything
they
wanted
to.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
certainly...
a
legatee
can
certainly
receive
funds
from
a
testator
without
having
consciously
participated
at
all,
and
the
testator...
i
don't
see
why
you
put
consciously
participate
into
your
definition
of
receive.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
not
talking
about
the
generic
meaning
of
the
word
"receive".
you
are
talking
about
the
word
"receive"
as
it
appears
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
federal
statute
that
the
college
would
be
violating
if
it
announced
and
enforced
a
policy
of
refusing
to
accept
any
student
who
received
federal
aid?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
be
a
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
give
us
any
breakdown
on
the
composition
of
the
students
receiving
this
particular
form
of
aid
at
grove
city?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
the
legislation,
title
9,
passed
as
part
and
parcel
of
a
financial
aid
bill?
i
mean,
it
was
passed
in
connection
with
precisely
this
kind
of
assistance.
unknown
speaker
and
north
haven
v.
bell
of
this
court
indicated
we
give
it
a
broad
reading.
so
how
do
you
explain
that?
and
there
are
references
in
the
legislative
record
that
discuss
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
that
legislation.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
then
that...
all
right.
do
you
think
that
the
receipt
cannot
be
indirect?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
has
to
be
direct?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
account
for
senator
humphreys'
statements
to
the
contrary?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
the
government
prevails
here,
what
will
be
in
your
view
the
effect
upon
women's
colleges
that
are
still
women's
colleges,
like
wilson
and
mt.
holyoke,
and
others?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
leave
this?
unknown
speaker
you
take
the
position
the
regulation
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
upshot
of
your
second
argument,
that
that's
the
program
that
should
be
regulated?
unknown
speaker
i
get
it
now.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
say,
though,
that
the
college
could
be
forced
to,
if
we
get
this
far,
that
the
college
could
be
forced
to
execute
some
kind
of
a
piece
of
paper--
unknown
speaker
--with
respect
to
that
program.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
seems
to
think
that
its
request
was
overbroad
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
but
they...
but
they
still
insist
on
something
broader
than
you
think
is
necessary,
even
if
you
are
a
recipient.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if...
what
if
you're
a
recipient,
and
what
if
the
program
is
the
grant
program
and
you
then
refuse
to
execute
the
proper
kind
of
a
piece
of
paper
limited
to
that
program?
could
the
government
then
terminate
the
funds
to
the
student?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--so
what
if
they
got
to
the
last
resort?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be,
but
all
of
that
is
out
of
the
way,
and
we
get
down...
your
position
is--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
thought
your
position
was
that
fund
termination
would
never
be
proper
in
case
of
a
refusal
to
execute
this
piece
of
paper.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
because
i
don't
really
understand,
i
don't
find
any...
there
is
really
nothing
to
your
third
argument,
then,
is
there?
if
you
were
wrong
on
the
first
two
arguments,
you
wouldn't
really
even
make
the
third
argument.
unknown
speaker
so
we
can
really
just
ignore
that
third
argument.
unknown
speaker
but
only
if
you're
right
on
one
of
the
other
two.
unknown
speaker
in
which
event
we
don't
need
to
reach
it.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
person
is
on
some
kind
of
a
welfare
program,
any
kind
of
a
program
that
funnels
federal
funds,
and
they
are
received
by
an
individual,
and
that
individual
then
decides
to
go
to
the
local
secretary
school
to
learn
to
become
a
secretary,
is
that
institution
then
receiving
federal
funds,
the
secretarial
school?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
close
about
a
social
security
recipient?
unknown
speaker
are
food
stamps
used
to
pay
for
the
food
in
the
cafeteria?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
certainly
subsidizing...
if
you
want
to
talk
just
about
resultant
aid,
i
don't
know
how
you
distinguish
that
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
colleges
provide
dormitories,
they
provide
food,
and
a
person
uses
social
security
money
to
pay
for
his...
to
pay
his
board
and
room
to
the
college.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
includes
that.
it
certainly
includes
that
as
long
as
people
are
free
to
use
it
to
pay
board
and
room
to
a
college.
unknown
speaker
may?
it
certainly
does.
how
can
you
say
it
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it's
difficult--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you.
that
sometimes
happens
with
acts
of
congress,
doesn't
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
my
hypothetical
question
did
not
focus
on
social
security
or
anything
of
that
kind
but
on
a
straight
welfare
grant.
social
security
is
something
to
which
contributions
are
made,
and
i
would
distinguish
it.
do
you
take
that
position
with
respect
to
an
unlimited,
voluntary
grant
by
the
federal
government
for
which
the
recipient
has
tendered
no
consideration
by
way
of
contributions?
unknown
speaker
you
are
pretty
close...
the
federal
government
is
pretty
close
to
it
right
here.
unknown
speaker
so
an
aid
to
dependent
children
that
is
keyed
to
whether
a
person
is
in
school
or
not
is...
you
get
it
if
you
are
in
school
and
you
don't
get
it
if
you
aren't.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
scholarship
money.
it
is
just
that
you
get...
there's
aid
provided
to
the
family
if
this
child
is
in
college,
and
it
isn't
provided
if
he
isn't.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
answer
to
justice
white's
question?
supposing
that
someone
is
enrolled
in
college
and
as
a
result
of
that
they
get
aid
to
dependent
children,
now,
would
that
result...
would
that
mean
that
the
college
was
regarded
as
federally...
receiving
federal
funds?
unknown
speaker
no,
you
just
get
it,
no,
you
just
get...
the
money
is
paid
to
the
family
if
a
child
is
in
school,
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
isn't
paid
if
it
isn't.
but
the
person
has
to
be
in
college
to
get
it.
and
this
is
unrestricted
money.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
college
would
violate
any
federal
statute
if
it
announced
and
enforced
a
program
of
refusing
to
admit
any
student
or
retain
any
student
who
accepted
federal
aid?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
they
simply
say
we
aren't
going
to
get
entangled
with
the
federal
government,
and
any
student
that
gets
federal
aid
is
out.
unknown
speaker
because
you
in
effect
tell
them
either
file
this
piece
of
paper
or
expel
the
students.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
also
say
it
is
free
to
expel
the
students.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
you
have
been
addressing
primarily
whether
this
program
is
fair
to
the
college,
but
what
do
you
think
about
the
fairness
with
respect
to
the
student
who
may
be
foreclosed
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
college
of
his
or
her
choice?
unknown
speaker
does
that
deprivation
of
liberty
seem
unfair
to
the
government
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
we
are
not
just
talking
about
grove
city.
perhaps
grove
city
is
unique.
it
certainly
has
never
discriminated
against
anybody
according
to
the
record,
and
it
seems
to
me
that--
unknown
speaker
--the
certificate,
though,
the
certificate
though
would
make
the
college
confess
that
it
is
subject
to
this
law.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
would
also
involve
that
then
the
federal
government
could
invoke
all
the
rigamarole
of
the
statute
against
the
college
if
it
happened
to
think
it
was
discriminating.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
the
regulation
is
invalid?
unknown
speaker
to
any
extent?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
construe
it.
unknown
speaker
construe
it...
well,
i
hadn't
thought
your
position
was
this
prior
to
now.
has
the
government--
unknown
speaker
--you've
been
defending
the
regulation
in
its
broadest
reading.
unknown
speaker
what
has
been
the
agency's
position?
unknown
speaker
that
issue
the
regulation.
what
is
their
position?
unknown
speaker
collegewide,
and
that
was
a
contemporary
construction.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
early,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
earlier
than
now.
unknown
speaker
so
tell
me
again,
what
coverage
do
you
think
is
triggered
by
the
acceptance
of
these
monies,
the
entire
grant
program
of
the
college?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
the
college
could
not
discriminate
in
giving
out
those
grants.
unknown
speaker
how
about
hiring
people
who
dispense
the
scholarship
aid?
unknown
speaker
yes.
could
you
tell
us
what
would
not
be
covered?
you
said
the
entire
grant
aid
program
would
be
covered,
but
if
a
student,
for
example,
has
a
loan
and
that
student
attended,
as
usually
happens,
20
or
30
classes
in
different
areas
of
learning
during
his
four
years,
would
each
of
those
classes
be
covered
simply
because
a
student
attended
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
limits
be?
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
limits
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
practical
terms,
you
are
the
president
of
the
university,
what
do
you
do?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
discrimination
in
employment,
the
city...
the
school
janitor?
unknown
speaker
when
you...
i
take
it,
then,
you
say
that
even
though
you
are
supposedly
limiting
your
submission
to
the
entire
grant-in-aid
program,
that
includes
the
entire
admissions
program.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
any
student
who
receives
any
of
this
aid.
unknown
speaker
you
have
already
told
us,
mr.
bator,
that
grove
city
college
could
announce
and
enforce
a
policy
of
rejecting
any
student
who
accepts
aid.
now,
that
would
hit
a
certain
category
of
people
who
can't
afford
to
pay
their
own
way.
wouldn't
that
be
a
discrimination
in
itself?
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
what
a
discrimination
in
the
grant
program
might
consist
of?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
couldn't
be
with
respect
to
someone
who
is
getting
federal
aid.
i
take
it
the
federal
government
wouldn't
be
discriminating.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
specific
question?
supposing
they
gave
football
scholarships
but
no
scholarships
for
female
athletes?
unknown
speaker
my
specific
example,
football
scholarships,
and
they
only
have
men
on
the
football
team,
would
that
be
covered
by
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
you
said...
i
think
you
said
that
you
would
say
the
regulations
are
all
valid
as
they
stand,
including
the
definition
of
recipient
and
all
the
other
provisions?
unknown
speaker
as
currently
written.
unknown
speaker
if
we
construe
them
as
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
reach
that.
you
would
just
construe
it
narrowly.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
never
have
to
wonder
whether
it
is
valid
or
not.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
can't
be
invalid,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
in
the
government's
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
said
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
program-specific
question
was
not
at
stake
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
shouldn't
reach
it.
now
the
government
has
briefed
it
and
is
arguing
it.
suppose
that
the
court
were
to
agree
with
the
government's
position
as
to
who
is
a
recipient,
what
should
the
court
do
with
the
program-specific
question
which
i
thought
the
government
had
argued
we
shouldn't
reach?
unknown
speaker
would
they
comply
with
your
demand
for
a
certificate
if
they
executed
a
piece
of
paper
that
said
we
are
in
compliance
with
title
9
insofar
as
it
applies?
[laughter]
validly
applies.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
yes,
that
would
be
all
they
have
to
do.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
at
the
close
of
your
opponent's
argument
he
in
effect
said
he
would
be
willing
to
sign
that
certificate.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
part
of
the
recipient.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
some
concern
about,
i
suppose,
about
their
authority
to
intervene,
if
the...
i
take
it
that
if...
you
suggest
or
seem
to
concede
that
if
grove
city
just
wouldn't
accept
any
students
accepting
federal
funds,
federal
intervention
would
be
nil,
except
for
the
title
7.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
the
purposes
of
congress
be
satisfied
if
the
application
of
these
restraints
or
limitations
were
confined
to
benefits
received
by
the
college
for
which
the
college
had
made
an
application,
an
affirmative
application?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
student's
family
receives
food
stamps,
that
maybe
relieves
the
student
of
the
necessity
for
taking
part
time
jobs,
and
therefore
there
is
an
indirect
federal
aid,
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
i
am
somewhat
surprised
about...
wasn't
title
9
re-enacted
at
some
point?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
re-enactment?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
amendments?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
re-enactment
of
the
grants
legislation?
unknown
speaker
at
a
time
when
it
was
perfectly
clear
how
those
grants
were
being
looked
upon
by
the
title
9
administrators?
unknown
speaker
okay,
thank
you.
professor
bator,
i
did
not
quite
understand
what
you
said
the
government's
position
was
with
respect
to
the
unisex
private
colleges?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
this
case.
does
this
case
have
any
effect
on
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
the
graduate
schools
of
unisex
private
colleges
would
be
covered?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
haven't
they
said
since
then
they
will
accept
a
lesser
certificate?
unknown
speaker
is
the
certificate
they
have
said
they
will
accept
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
but
their
proposed
substitute
has
not
been--
unknown
speaker
--reduced
to
writing.
unknown
speaker
has
the...
weren't
these
grants
created
by
an
amendment
to
title
what,
title
9?
unknown
speaker
but
was
there
an
amendment
to
title
9?
unknown
speaker
just
a
part
of
that.
unknown
speaker
what
was?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
how
about
this,
the
grant
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
it
has
been
re-enacted.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
re-enacted
at
a
time
when...
was
it
still
in
the
same
legislative
basket
with
title
9?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
regulations
under
title
9
saying
that
receipt
of
these...
not
the
receipt,
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--the
whole
proposition.
unknown
speaker
this
agency
interpretation
of
the
regulations
was
well
known
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
since
then,
since
then
the
grant
legislation
has
been
re-enacted.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
has
the
grant
program
been?
unknown
speaker
with
the
regulations
on
the
books.
unknown
speaker
with
the
meaning
that
the
agency
had
been
giving
to
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
re-enactment
against
that
background
is
really
just
post-legislative
history
or
post-enactment
history,
or
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's...
isn't
it
something
you
have
to
deal
with?
unknown
speaker
these
regulations
were
presented
to
congress
under
a
now
invalidated
procedure,
and--
unknown
speaker
--in
any
event,
neither
house
rejected
this
interpretation
of
