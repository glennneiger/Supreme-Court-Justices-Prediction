mr.
e.
edward
bruce
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
know
the
first
question
i
must
answer
and
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
brennan,
is
that,
indeed,
the
statute
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
an
inconsistency
determination
is
made
later
and
if
the
secretary
of
commerce
does
not
override
it,
as
he
has
the
power
to
do,
then
the
lessees
under
the
statute--
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
--he
may
do
so--
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
--what
does
it
mean?
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
well,
the
regulations
define
it
hardly
adding
much
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
there
is
a
regulatory
definition
within
the
department
of
commerce
as
to
the
policy
matters
the
secretary
of
commerce
may
consider.
to
my
knowledge,
no
successful
appeal
has
yet
been
invoked,
but
i
should
add
that
this
statute
still
is
rather
new
to
us.
there
is
little
experience
under
it.
i
would
like
to
also
amplify,
justice
stevens,
one
of
the
answers
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
to
one
of
your
questions.
at
the
later
stages,
under
307(c)(3)(b),
it
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
lessee
compliance.
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
under
section
11
and
section
25
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
is
directed
not
to
approve
the
requisite
permits
for
exploration
or
production
and
development
unless
consistency
is
achieved.
so,
he
doesn't
step
out
of
the
picture.
he
is
very
much
into
the
picture.
congress
explicitly
put
him
into
the
picture.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
well,
in
1972,
that
part
of
the
ocs
lands
act
did
not
exist.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
but,
our
position--
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
--i
would
go
back
even
further.
i
would
go
back
to
1953
and
consider
what
congress
did
in
reaction
to
this
court's
decisions
in
the
so-called
tidelands
oil
controversy,
look
at
that
determination,
and
then
ask
the
question
whether
the
statutory
language
that
they
used
in
1972
and
the
legislative
history
associated
with
the
1972...
radically
changed
that.
the
plaintiffs
say
that
it
did,
but
the
plaintiffs
offer
no
definition,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
told
us,
of
the
term
"directly
affecting"
that
begins
at
all
to
comport
with
their
position.
to
the
contrary,
it
is
their
position
in
their
briefs...
california's
position
that
the
meaning
of
these
terms
are
unclear
and
they
urge
upon
this
court
what
they
themselves
characterize
as
a
broad,
liberal,
or
expansive
definition
in
order
to
suit
their
needs.
they
not
only
ignore
the
language
of
section
307(c)(1),
they
ignore
the
very
specific
arrangements
of
section
19
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
where
in
1978
congress
addressed
this
very
question,
what
role
shall
we
create
for
the
states
in
the
ocs
tract
selection
process
at
the
leasing
stage
and
provided
an
arrangement
quite
different
than
the
one
that
emerges
from
their
interpretation.
they
ignore
307(c)(3)(b)
and
what
it
says
about
the
role
of
the
czma
in
the
ocs
process
and
they
ignore
sections
11
and
25
that
interlock
these
two.
now,
how
do
they
justify
this?
they
do
it
ultimately
on
a
policy
argument.
they
say
really
that
ocs
leasing
is
simply
so
important
that
we
simply
must
have
this
authority,
we
must
have
input
at
the
leasing
stage.
there
are
three,
at
least
three
dispositive
answers
to
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
recent
years
and
in
past
years
that
we
start
with
the
language
with
which
congress
expressed
itself.
we
don't
ask
the
judges
to
delve
into
policy
and
create
a
different
scheme.
a
second
answer
is
this:
in
1978,
when
the
ocs
lands
acts
was
completely
revised,
congress
addressed
the
very
policy
question
upon
which
plaintiffs
stand
here;
that
is
the
need
for
state
input
into
the
process.
that
was
defined
as
a
major
policy
goal
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
when
congress
did
that
it
adopted
section
19.
indeed,
it
adopted
it
at
the
urging
of
california,
massachusetts
and
other
states
who,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
the
1972
czma
said,
we
need
a
role
in
the
tract
selection
process
and
congress
gave
them
that
role.
and,
that
role
was
for
governors
to
make
recommendations;
that
role
was
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
have
final
authority
to
assess
a
balance
between
state
and
national
interests
subject,
of
course,
to
judicial
review
in
a
well-defined
means.
indeed,
even
in
1976,
when
congress
was
addressing
policy
under
the
czma,
in
making
these
major
amendments
to
that
act,
taking
into
account
the
need
to
have
an
aggressive
ocs
program,
it
addressed
the
policy
question
and
it
said
we
are
giving
the
states
a
right
to
apply
their
programs
at
these
later
stages,
at
exploration
and
development.
and,
the
conference
report
said
that
this
would
satisfy
state
needs
for
complete
information
on
a
timely
basis
about
the
details
of
the
oil
industry's
plans.
that
is,
by
the
way,
in
our
brief
at
page
42.
congress
made
this
policy
statement
at
exactly
the
time
it
was
rejecting
a
proposal
to
make
leases
subject
to
consistency
review.
congress
has
rejected
their
policy
argument.
congress
has
found
an
expression
or
place
for
the
policy
to
be
achieved
elsewhere.
a
final
answer
to
their
policy
argument,
we
submit,
can
be
found
in
their
steady
resistance
to
offer
to
this
court
or
any
court
what
would
flow
from
adopting
their
directly
affecting
argument.
what
consequences
would
we
have?
in
the
lower
court,
certainly
in
the
trial
court,
they
said
they
would
have
final
authority,
recognizing
the
improbability,
shall
i
say,
of
that
position.
they
now
retreat
to
some
undefined
degree
of
deference
that
would
have
if
(c)(1)
applies
as
they
say
it
applies.
the
point
to
nothing
in
the
czma,
the
ocs
lands
act,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
general
principles
of
administrative
law,
that
this
court
or
any
court
could
consider
in
deciding
how
much
deference
they
were
due.
they
would
create,
it
seems
to
me,
litigation
over
the
years
trying
to
make
these
case-by-case
adjustments
as
the
ninth
circuit
itself
recognized.
now,
sometimes,
indeed,
all
too
often,
this
court
is
confronted
with
statutory
schemes
where
congress
hasn't
been
specific
enough
and
litigation
must
be
resorted
to
to
solve
these
kinds
of
problems.
we
submit
in
this
case
the
confusion
implicit
in
the
plaintiff's
position
could
be
achieved
only
be
ignoring
congress'
repeated
statements
time
and
time
again
as
to
how
these
two
statutory
schemes
are
to
work.
we
submit
that
the
court
should
hold
that
the
leasing
stage,
the
selection
of
tracts
itself,
does
not
directly
affect
the
coastal
zone.
the
court,
in
its
opinion,
should
also
recognize
that
section
19
provides
a
ready
means
for
state
input
into
the
process.
in
so
holding,
the
court
would
harmonize
the
two
statutes,
the
czma
and
the
ocsla.
it
would
recognize
the
basic
policy
position
upon
which
the
plaintiffs
stand,
the
need
for
state
input,
and
it
would
channel
disputes
into
a
congressionally
defined
administrative
mechanism
with
judicial
review.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
far
better
way
to
resolve
the
issues
in
this
case
rather
than
to
indulge
plaintiffs
in
their
expansive
and
liberal
approach
to
the
legislation
which
raises
far
more
problems
than
it
settles.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
mr.
e.
edward
bruce
thank
you.
