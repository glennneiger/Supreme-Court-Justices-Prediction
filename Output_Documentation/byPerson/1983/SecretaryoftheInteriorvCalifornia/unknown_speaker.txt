unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
solicitor
general,
this
has
to
be
in
the
context
of
a
coastal
zone
plan,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
how
does
one
of
those
come
into
being?
unknown
speaker
what
does
one
of
those
look
like?
are
there
many
of
them?
unknown
speaker
there
are?
unknown
speaker
not
very
detailed
then?
unknown
speaker
can
you
suggest
what
they
cover?
unknown
speaker
but,
none
of
the
four
stages
comes
into
play
until
there
is
such
an
agreement
arrived
at?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
has
to
be
arrived
at
between
whom?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
secretary
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
at
the
lease
stage,
is
anything
contemplated
except
survey?
unknown
speaker
that
is
all?
unknown
speaker
my
next
question
was
are
there
any
effects
at
that
stage
from
surveying?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
phased
decision
making?
as
i
understand
it,
the
approval
requirements
for
exploration,
development,
or
production
are
found
in
307(c)(3)(b),
is
that
right,
which
was
enacted
in
1978,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
'76.
now,
during...
i
take
it
the
critical
language
we
are
focusing
on
was
enacted
some
years
earlier?
unknown
speaker
now,
during
the
period
between
the
enactment
of
307(c)(1)
and
the
later
enactment
of
the
phased
decision
making,
during
the
five
or
six
years
when
there
was
no
phased
decision
making,
would
you
say
directly
affecting
meant
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
say
the
directly
affecting
requirement
for
your
position
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
the
successive
phased
decision
making
then?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
language
adopted
in
the
later
stages
applies
to
what
the
lessee
must
do?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
provision
directing
the
government,
the
federal
government,
in
its
activity
to
comply
with
this
consistency
requirement?
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand.
what
language
makes
the
government
do
anything
in
this
regard,
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
where
is
307(c)(1)
in
the
petition?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
may
i
ask
one
more
question?
unknown
speaker
under
your
reading
of
these
acts,
would
the
state
lose
anything
by
waiting
until
the
exploration
stage
for
consistency--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
just
this
though?
if
that
had
not
been
enacted,
as
you
read
307(c)(1),
the
government
nevertheless
would
have
been
under
an
obligation
at
that
time
to
make
the
determination,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
really
didn't
need
the
subsequent
history?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
also
true
that
the
(b)...
these
are
long
titles--
unknown
speaker
--the
one
added
imposes
an
obligation
on
lessee
with
respect
to
land
that
has
already
been
leased?
unknown
speaker
whereas,
the
one
that
is
in
dispute
here
is
the
one
that
imposes
the
obligation
on
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
have
rather
different
spheres
of
operation.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
the
contrary
legislative
history,
just
say
that
it
is
post-enactment
legislative...
what
about
the
senate
and
house
reports?
unknown
speaker
i
gather,
mr.
solicitor
general,
a
lessee
who
has
to
wait
until
the
exploration
stage
may
lose
his
whole
investment
if
there
is
a
finding
that
stands
up
of
inconsistency
later,
doesn't
he.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
may
i
ask
you,
what
are
the
circumstances
under
which
the
secretary
may
over-ride
it?
unknown
speaker
what
does
national
security
mean,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
in
the
picture
in
1972,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
that
is
my
point.
unknown
speaker
to
look
at
the
problem
as
of
'72,
we
would
have
nothing
but
the
language,
directly
affected,
to
deal
with.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
that
the
issue
is
not
the
meaning
of
the
words
"directly
affecting",
but
instead
it
is
the
legislative
intent
in
using
those
terms?
unknown
speaker
where
was
that?
unknown
speaker
a
great
number
is
how
many?
unknown
speaker
fifteen.
where
are
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
not
the
whole...
are
they
east
or
west
or
what?
unknown
speaker
east
and
west.
massachusetts
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--are
those
three
instances
pending
in
litigation?
unknown
speaker
pending
district
courts
or
what?
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
ms.
berger,
if
your
position
is
not
accepted,
what
is
the
consequence?
unknown
speaker
you
are
going
to
tell
us
why?
unknown
speaker
who
decides,
ms.
berger,
whether
or
not
there
will
be
piecemeal
submission
or
perhaps
a
more
general
submission?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
less
satisfactory
and
why
must
the
state
proceed
only
on
a
tract-by-tract
basis
if
it
is
done
at
the
later
stage?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
307(c)(3),
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
state's
ability
limited
in
the
307(c)(3)
stage?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
307(c)(3)
stage?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
going
to
address
the
307(c)(3)
stage,
why
the
states
can't
do
anything
about
it
at
that
stage.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
can't
say
we
don't
think
that
should
be
leased,
but
you
can
surely
say
at
the
307(c)(3)
we
don't
think
it
should
be
developed,
we
don't
think
you
should
drill
for
oil
there,
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but,
i
thought
you
were
saying
a
minute
ago
the
state
couldn't
do
that
and
now
you
are
saying
it
can.
unknown
speaker
now,
wait
a
minute.
you
said
the
oil
companies
have
acquired
rights
to
develop
the
tract.
you
are
saying
that
either
the
secretary
couldn't
say
at
that
stage
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
state's
coastal
management
plan
to
drill
for
oil
here
and
do
you
think
the
oil
company
could
simply
say,
well,
gee,
we
have
put
a
lot
money
in
this
thing,
so
let's
forget
about
the
consistency
determination?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
state
does.
the
state
does.
the
state
can
say
it
if
it
wants
to
and
the
oil
company
takes
the
risk
of
being
able
to
comply
with
the
coastal
management
plan,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
awfully
direct
if
the
state
says,
sorry,
you
are
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
berger,
as
i
understood
it
at
least,
the
first
stage
of
offshore
development
and
leasing
would
be
the
development
of
the
five-year
schedules
by
the
department
of
interior
of
the
ocs
lease
sales
and
during
that
interval
of
time,
the
secretary
of
interior,
as
i
understand
it,
is
required
to
solicit
comments
from
both
interested
federal
agencies
as
well
as
the
governors
of
each
state
and
has
to
respond
in
writing
to
all
those
state
governors'
comments.
so,
that
is
the
first
stage
when
the
state
can
participate,
right?
unknown
speaker
before
you
even
get
to
this
section
we
are
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
then,
in
addition,
i
thought
the
second
stage,
where
the
state
had
an
opportunity,
was
in
meeting
the
requirements
of
nepa
and
the
endangered
species
act
where
the
governor
of
every
state
affected
is
given
a
formal
opportunity
to
submit
recommendations
on
the
size
and
the
timing
and
the
locations
of
the
proposed
leases.
so,
we
have
already
had
two
opportunities,
have
we
not,
for
states
as
a
whole
to
impact
on
the
tract
selection
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
'78?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
house
report?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
senate
about
it?
unknown
speaker
by
stipulate
where,
ms.
berger?
unknown
speaker
by
stipulation
where?
unknown
speaker
but,
ms.
berger,
isn't
it
true
in
connection
with
many
of
the
tracts
at
the
lease
sale
stage
the
potential
lessees
don't
eve
know
what
the
mineral
contents
of
the
tracts
are?
they
don't
know
whether
they
are
going
to
find
anything
worth
drilling
for
developing.
unknown
speaker
so,
why
would
you
be
talking
about
a
consolidated
facility
at
that
stage?
unknown
speaker
but,
under
307(c)(3),
the
state
can
object
after
that
stage
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
its
coastal
management
plan,
can't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
congress
has
said
that
is
the
time
you
object,
why
is
it
too
late?
unknown
speaker
for
things
that
directly
affect?
unknown
speaker
ms.
berger,
is
it
true
that
the
original
bills
involved
when
this
directly
affected
language
was
added
to
czma,
under
both
the
original
house
and
senate
bills,
it
was
reasonably
clear,
was
it
not,
that
the
lease
sale
stage
would
not
have
required
the
czma
consistency
submission?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it
was
only
this
last-minute
amendment
that
imposed
the
requirement
that
we
are
now
dealing
with.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
that
your
reference
to
the
prior
bill
affected
was
originally
in
the
coastal
zone
language.
are
there
situations
in
which
there
are
lease
sales
within
a
coastal
zone?
unknown
speaker
do
they
directly
affect
the
coastal
zone?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
any
federal
activity
connected
with
it?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
federal
supervision?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
who
made
these
statements?
unknown
speaker
did
they
amend
this
section
containing
the
words
"directly
affecting"?
unknown
speaker
but,
they
are
all
post-enactment
statements,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
as
to
directly
affecting.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
usually
give
too
much
weight
to
post-enactment
statements,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
and
the
'78
amendments
to
the
ocs
act,
that
legislative
history
is
not
post
anything.
it
is
in
connection
with
those
amendments.
and,
i
understand
the
committee
to
have
said
that
nothing
in
these
amendments
should
indicate
that
you
should
rely
on
the
act,
on
those
amendments
or
on
the
ocs
act
for
any
inference
that
lease
sales
weren't
covered.
unknown
speaker
does
each
of
us
have
one
of
those?
unknown
speaker
does
each
of
us
have
one
of
those?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
referred
to
this
in
your
papers
before?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
ordinarily
something
that
counsel
put
in
as
a
matter
of
rebuttal
though.
unknown
speaker
how
long
have
you
had
that
document?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
long
has
the
government
had
it?
unknown
speaker
i,
for
one,
would
welcome
any
comment
from
your
opposition
in
due
course.
may
i
ask...
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
argument
you
are
making
based
on
the
document.
you
are
saying,
i
gather,
from
the
document
that
is
possible
to
make
cumulative
impact
analysis
later.
unknown
speaker
but,
i
guess
it
could
also
be
more
difficult,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
possible
that,
say,
you
have
a
very
large
area
that
you
must
look
at
at
the
beginning
of
the
lease
sale
and
you
then
have
to
look
at
the
total
picture,
but
you
could
execute
the
leases
and
you
might
have
development
of
ten
percent
of
the
tract
the
first
year
and
nothing
even
looked
at
for
awhile.
now,
if
you
only
had
ten
percent
to
start
with,
how
could
you
then
do
the
whole
cumulative
impact?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
comment
that
you
would
care
to
make
on
the
letter?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
documents
that
bear
on
this
and
tend
to
develop
what
you
have
just
suggested?
unknown
speaker
we
will
receive
them.
unknown
speaker
what
happens
if
they
want
to
answer
those
documents?
[laughter]
