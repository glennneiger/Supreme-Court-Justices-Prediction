ms.
theodora
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
going
to
try
and
explain
this
morning
why
it
is
important
to
apply
state
coastal
zone
management
programs
which
are
federally
approved
to
the
department
of
interior's
outer
continental
shelf
leasing
activities
and
how
that
process
can,
in
fact,
work.
but,
before
i
get
to
that
point,
i
am
going
to
be
addressing
what
petitioners'
definition
of
the
directly
affecting
test
is.
and,
let
me
just
say
at
the
outset
that
they
would
like
to
have
this
court
define
the
phrase
307(c)(3)
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act
solely
be
reference
to
the
purposes
and
policies
of
an
entirely
different
statute,
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
amendment.
now,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
earlier,
those
amendments
were
not
passed
until
1978.
this
entire
system
of
phased
development
that
they
are
relying
on
for
their
definition
of
the
directly
affecting
test
was
a
subsequently
enacted
statute.
the
words
1972
and
that
is
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court
for
construction.
let
me
also
emphasize
that
it
is
a
phrase
we
are
talking
about,
"directly
affecting
the
coastal
zone".
petitioners
would
like
to
have
the
court
simply
define
the
word
"directly".
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
it
is
legislative
intent
on
that
phrase
in
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
it
is
also
important--
ms.
theodora
berger
--it
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
"directly
affecting
the
coastal
zone".
it
is
not
one
word
"directly",
as
petitioners
would
have
it.
it
is
also
important
to
focus
on
how
petitioners
have
suggested
that
that
phrase
be
defined.
according
to
petitioners,
no
federal
activity
directly
affects
the
coastal
zone
unless
it
has
immediate
physical
impacts
on
the
coastal
zone
without
subsequent
governmental
approvals.
you
will
find
that
test
in
the
solicitor's
brief
and
in
the
letter
to
california
refusing
to
do
a
consistency
determination
for
lease
sale
53.
now,
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
where
did
that
test
come
from?
you
can't
find
it
in
the
legislation
history.
to
the
contrary,
all
of
the
legislative
history
contradicts
that
test.
it
doesn't
really
foster
the
purposes
of
the
act
because
this
was
an
act
that
was
designed
for
the
long-term
management
of
the
coastal
zone
through
a
process
of
federal/state
coordination
and
cooperation.
i
submit
that
that
process
would
not
be
fostered
by
a
restrictive
definition
such
as
the
one
put
forth
by
petitioners.
the
only
thing
they
can
site
for
this
narrow
definition
is
the
dictionary.
now,
if
you
look...
again,
the
dictionary
definition
is
only
of
the
word
"directly".
it
doesn't
give
us
any
definition
of
the
phrase.
but,
if
you
look
at
the
dictionary
definition,
you
will
not
find
the
definition
offered
by
petitioners.
the
dictionary
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
have
physical
impacts.
the
dictionary
doesn't
say
anything
about
subsequent
governmental
approvals.
the
only
thing...
the
closest
thing
that
they
can
find
in
the
dictionary
is
the
notion
of
intervening
cause.
and,
the
trial
court
analyzed
that
test
and
said
even
under
that
test
lease
sale
53
would
directly
affect
the
coastal
zone
because
this
is
the
activity
that
sets
in
motion
the
whole
chain
of
events
which
lead
to
the
coastal
zone
impacts
with
which
we
are
concerned.
this
is
the
key
activity.
the
other
important
thing
to
understand
about
petitioners'
definition
is
that
it
virtually
exempts
all
of
the
department
of
interior's
significant
ocs
decision
making;
that
is
tract
selection
and
the
imposition
of
lease
stipulations.
now,
mr.
bruce
said
this
morning
that
under
their
definition
tract
selection
is
exempt.
you
will
that
also
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
72.
in
the
letter
to
california
refusing
to
do
the
consistency
determination,
the
department
of
interior
explained
that
under
their
definition
tract
selection
is
not
an
activity
that
requires
compliance
with
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
in
fact,
as
i
must
admit,
it
is
only
in
the
rarest
of
cases
under
their
definition
that
lease
sales
would
ever
come
into
this
process
of
coastal
zone
management
that
was
anticipated
by
congress.
and,
in
fact,
there
has
only
been
on
instance
in
the
entire
history
of
ocs
leasing
since
1972
that
i
am
aware
of
where
they
have
ever
actually
applied
consistency
to
a
lease
sale.
ms.
theodora
berger
that
was
an
instance
in
alaska,
your
honor,
in
1977.
that
was
a
particularly
unusual
situation
where
the
department
of
interior
imposed
a
stipulation
requiring
the
lessee
to
immediately
build
gravel
islands
and
the
department
felt
that
the
gravel
islands
themselves
would
cause
impacts
on
the
coastal
zone.
therefore,
they
did
a
consistency
determination
on
the
effect
of
building
the
gravel
islands,
but
no
consistency
determination
on
the
effect
of
the
lease
sale.
now,
one
of
the
main
arguments
of
the
department
of
interior
is
that
you
simply
cannot
apply
the
consistency
process
to
their
ocs
leasing
activities.
it
would
be
unworkable.
you
would
have
a
morass
of
litigation
and
the
very
important
federal
ocs
leasing
program
would
grind
to
a
halt.
well,
i
submit
that
that
has
been
disproven,
your
honors,
because
as
a
result
of
litigation
in
this
case,
the
department
of
interior
has
been
forced
to
prepare
consistency
determinations
all
over
the
country
for
a
great
number
of
states.
i
would
like
to
bring
to
your
attention
the
record--
ms.
theodora
berger
--fifteen.
ms.
theodora
berger
would
you
like
a
list?
ms.
theodora
berger
east
and
west.
ms.
theodora
berger
massachusetts
is
one,
yes.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
brief
summary
of
what
has
happened,
because
that
certainly
is
very
pertinent
here.
as
to
six
of
those
consistency
determinations,
and
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
the
department
of
interior
that
makes
the
consistency
determination.
they
send
it
to
the
state,
the
state
has
a
right
to
agree
or
disagree.
if
there
is
a
disagreement,
they
try
and
work
their
differences
out.
the
department
of
interior
in
six
instances
sent
their
determination
to
the
state.
they
said
we
find
that
this
lease
sale
is
consistent
with
your
coastal
zone
management
program.
the
state
looked
at
the
consistency
determination
and
said,
you
are
right,
we
agree
with
you,
and
there
is
no
problem
with
holding
this
lease
sale
just
as
you
have
suggested.
in
five
instances,
the
state
said,
no,
we
think
there
are
problems
for
coastal
zone
management
if
you
go
ahead
exactly
as
you
have
said,
but
they
sat
down
together
and
they
tried
to
resolve
the
problem
in
a
way
that
would
allow
the
lease
sale
to
proceed
while
still
taking
into
account
these
coastal
zone
management
concerns.
in
each
of
those
five
instances,
the
department
of
interior
reached
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
state
which
in
no
way
interfered
with
the
holding
of
the
lease
sale.
in
only
three
instances
to
date,
out
of
all
of
these
consistency
determinations,
has
litigation
resulted.
so,
we
don't
have
the
disastrous
effects
that
had
been
predicted
by
the
department
of
interior.
ms.
theodora
berger
two
of
them
are
pending
and
one
was
dismissed.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
let's
see,
they
are
in
the
district
court
except
the
one
in
massachusetts
went
up
on
appeal.
the
court
upheld
an
injunction
that
was
issued
on
the
grounds
of
nepa
and
now
it
is
back
in
the
district
court.
now,
petitioners
will
try
and
tell
you
that
this
entire
process,
these
agreements
that
were
worked
out,
were
solely
as
a
result
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
amendments,
that
they
can
reach
agreements
with
the
states
under
the
ocs
lands
act.
but,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
four
out
of
the
five
agreements
that
were
reached
expressly
relied
on
the
coastal
zone
management
program
for
the
state.
so,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
process
is
workable,
it
can
be
done
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
notwithstanding
all
petitioners'
arguments
to
the
contrary.
ms.
theodora
berger
i
am
just
coming
to
that,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
think
that
this
process
is
workable
at
the
exploration
and
development
stage.
it
is
simply
too
late
and
try
to
do
coastal
zone
management--
ms.
theodora
berger
--yes,
i
am
going
to
that
right
now.
the
reason
is,
the
difference
between
section
307(c)(1)
and
section
307(c)(3),
which
some
of
the
questions
were
directed
to
this
morning.
section
307(c)(1)
is
the
only
section
in
the
czma
that
can
cover
the
department
of
interior's
ocs
activities.
those
are
the
activities
of
the
lease
sale
where
they
select
tracts
and
they
impose
lease
sale
stipulations.
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
this
morning,
a
lot
of
money
changes
hand
at
this
stage.
these
are
very
expensive
propositions
when
you
hold
a
lease
sale.
lease
sale
53
alone,
the
total
bids
were
over
$2
billion,
and
chevron
bid
$333
million
for
one
tract
in
lease
sale
53.
it
gives
you
an
idea
of
the
importance
of
the
lease
sale
stage.
the
oil
companies
are
not
putting
up
that
kind
of
money
for
the
mere
ability
to
apply
for
subsequent
permits.
they
are
spending
that
kind
of
money
for
what
they
perceived
to
be
the
ability
to
develop
the
tract.
otherwise,
i
submit,
that
nobody
would
expend
these
huge
sums.
now,
let's
take
an
example
of
why
you
can't
work
it
out
under
section
307(c)(3).
307(c)(3)
is,
as
the
court
pointed
out
earlier,
at
a
subsequent
stage.
the
lease
sale
has
already
been
held,
the
money
has
already
changed
hands.
the
leases
are
not
in
the
hands
of
the
oil
companies,
the
lessees
of
the
tract.
the
lessees
come
to
the
state
for
a
consistency
review
under
section
307(c)(3)
on
a
piecemeal,
random
basis,
often
one
tract
at
a
time.
there
is
no
way
at
that
point
to
address
the
coastal
zone
impacts,
if
you
will,
of
the
lease
sale
as
a
whole.
and,
it
is
impossible
to
do
anything
more
than
piecemeal
review.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
in
this
case,
it
is
the
department
of
interior,
because
if
consistency
review
were
applied
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
you
could
address
these
concerns
on
a
broader
basis.
but,
if
you
cannot...
if
they
refuse
to
do
the
consistency
determination,
then
the
state
can
only
reach
these
concerns
on
a
tract-by-tract
basis
which
is,
of
course,
not
a
very
satisfactory
way
of
proceeding.
ms.
theodora
berger
because
the
state
has
no
ability
to
do
anything
at
the
lease
sale
stage
unless
the
department
of
interior
is
subjected
to
consistency
review.
the
state's
ability
only
comes
in
at
the
subsequent
stages.
ms.
theodora
berger
right.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
one
of
the
major
parts
of
the
department
of
interior's
decisions
at
the
lease
sale
stage
is
the
question
of
tract
selection.
that
is
the
determination
of
where
in
a
given
area
they
are
going
to
allow
development
through
leasing
and
what
areas
they
are
going
to
exclude
from
development.
so,
suppose
you
had
a
situation
where
the
state
was
concerned
about
a
coastal
zone
resource
of
national
significance
that
was
recognized
under
its
coastal
zone
management
program,
and
suppose
also
that
the
only
way
to
protect
that
particular
resource
was
to
not
lease
and
develop
the
immediately
adjacent
ocs
tracts...
and
bear
in
mind
one
particular
fact
about
lease
sale
53.
the
ocs
tracts
at
issue
in
this
case
begin
at
the
three-mile
limit
which
is
immediately
adjacent
to
the
coastal
zone
that
the
coastal
zone
management
act
is
concerned
with
protecting
and
managing.
all
right.
so,
what
can
you
do
about
tract
selection?
well,
petitioners
say,
well,
we
don't
have
enough
information
at
this
stage
to
address
the
coastal
zone
management
program,
but
that
certainly
is
incorrect
because
the
lease
sale
stage--
ms.
theodora
berger
--no,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
lease
sale--
ms.
theodora
berger
--because
you
can't
do
tract
deletion
at
the
307(c)(3)
stage.
ms.
theodora
berger
tract
deletion
is
a
leasing
decision
made
by
the
department
of
interior.
ms.
theodora
berger
you
mean
for
a
state
to
do
that?
ms.
theodora
berger
if
a
state...
if
your
honors
apply
the
statute
in
that
way,
then
the
state
will
have
no
recourse
but
to
do
that.
ms.
theodora
berger
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
not
a
practical
way
to
go
about
it
because
all
of
this
money
has
now
been
expended.
the
oil
companies
have
acquired
rights
to
develop
the
tract.
ms.
theodora
berger
the
secretary
has
nothing
to
say
about
consistency
under
section
307(c)(3).
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
your
honor,
you
could
look
at
it
that
way,
but
that
is
not
a
very
practical
way
to
go
about
things.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
i
guess
the
other
main
problem
with
it,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
an
act
that
is
designed
for
comprehensive,
long-term
planning
and
management
and
it
is
a
little
late
to
start
that
planning
after
the
major
planning
decisions
have
been
made
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
ms.
theodora
berger
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
theodora
berger
yes.
ms.
theodora
berger
your
honor,
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
congress
intended
a
different
opportunity
for
the
states
under
the
coastal
zone
management
act.
and,
you
can
find
that
expressly
stated
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
ocs
lands
act.
the
legislative
history
of
section
1345
of
the
act...
this
was
in
section
19
of
the
amendments...
that
is
the
very
section
of
the
ocs
lands
act
that
talks
about
ocs
leasing
and
that
legislative
history
expressly
states
that
the
department
of
interior's
ocs
lease
sales
are
expected
to
comply
with
coastal
zone
management
programs.
now,
petitioners
always
skip
over
that
piece
of
legislative
history,
but
we
submit
that
it
is
extremely
telling.
ms.
theodora
berger
that
is
in
'78.
ms.
theodora
berger
yes,
the
final
house
report.
ms.
theodora
berger
no.
and,
the
act
followed
the
house
report
so
that
is
the
one
that
was
entitled
to
weight.
perhaps
i
can
give
you
another
example
other
than
tract
deletion
and
that
is
the
imposition
of
lease
stipulations
at
the
lease
sale
stage.
this
is
a
very
important
example,
because
frequently
these
agreements,
recent
agreements
with
the
states
that
have
been
worked
out
illustrate.
frequently
leasing
can
be
squared
with
coastal
zone
management
programs
simply
by
the
imposition
of
stipulations.
you
don't
need
tract
deletion
at
all
and
that
is
a
very
important
reason
to
start
this
process
at
the
lease
sale
stage
rather
than
waiting
for
later
when
you
can
look
at
the
lease
sale
as
a
whole.
ms.
theodora
berger
pardon
me?
ms.
theodora
berger
a
lease
stipulation
is
a
term
of
a
contract
between
the
department
of
interior
and
the
lessee
oil
company.
and,
that
is
an
important
point
because
when
they
issue
the
lease,
all
of
the
stipulations
that
the
department
of
interior
has
determined
will
be
part
of
this
lease
sale
are
then
included
in
each
of
the
contracts
with
the
oil
companies.
so,
the
companies
know
from
the
very
outset
what
the
rules
of
the
game
are
going
to
be.
that
is
another
important
reason
the
coastal
zone
management
program
must
be
brought
to
bear
at
that
point.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
the
california
coastal
zone
management
program
contains
a
policy
which
requires
the
consolidation
of
onshore
support
facilities
for
offshore
oil
and
gas
development.
now,
that
is
a
sensible
policy
because
otherwise
you
would
have
a
proliferation
of
these
support
facilities
all
along
the
coast
and
it
is
in
keeping
with
a
requirement
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act
that
you
have
orderly
siting
of
onshore
support
facilities
for
offshore
oil
development.
now,
how
do
you
take
care
of
this
consolidation
problem?
consolidation
is
something
that
requires
the
oil
companies
to
cooperate
with
one
another
to
agree
on
a
consolidated
marine
terminal
or
a
consolidated
supply
base
onshore.
they
have
to
reach
agreements,
they
have
to
plan
for
this
over
a
period
of
time.
if
you
wait
until
the
exploration
and
development
stage,
the
oil
is
about
to
come
on
shore.
it
has
to
get
there
some
way.
the
oil
company
is
now
four
years
into
its
lease
and
they
have
a
five-year
lease
in
which
to
get
the
oil
out.
it
is
too
late
to
be
telling
an
oil
company
coming
in
for
approval
on
one
tract,
we
are
sorry,
but
you
have
to
build
a
consolidated
facility.
the
oil
company
will
say
we
can't
possibly
do
it
at
this
point,
we
should
have
been
told
this
earlier.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
all
of
the
details
of
this
consolidated
facility
should
be
worked
out
at
the
lease
sale
stage.
that
certainly
wouldn't
be
workable.
but,
we
are
suggesting
that
unless
you
impose
the
requirement
of
a
consolidated
facility
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
it
simply
isn't
going
to
happen
as
a
practical
matter.
ms.
theodora
berger
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but--
ms.
theodora
berger
--well,
let
me
respond.
first
of
all,
they
do
have
a
fairly
good
idea
of
what
is
out
there
because
they
have
resource
estimates
that
the
department
of
interior
itself
relied
on
to
determine
whether
the
bids
are
adequate.
in
fact,
often
times
they
have
even
more
specific
information
on
expected
resources
based
upon
development
of
adjacent
tracts.
but,
more
importantly,
this
is
the
time
when
they
decide
whether
the
tracts
will
be
developed
or
not.
in
other
words,
it
is
possible
you
may
not
find
oil
in
a
given
tract,
but
if
you
do
find
oil,
the
lease
sale
stage
is
the
time
when
the
department
of
interior
has
decided
that
development
is
going
to
go
forward
on
that
tract.
ms.
theodora
berger
the
state
can
object,
but
as
we
said,
your
honor,
that
is
a
little
late
to
do
the
comprehensive
planning
that
this
statute
requires.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
congress
did
not
say
that
is
the
only
time
you
object.
section
307(c)(1)
is
a
residual,
catchall
category
according
to
the
department
of
commerce
regulations.
ms.
theodora
berger
that
is
correct.
perhaps
a
better
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
the
legislative
history.
congress
has
said
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history
of
both
statutes,
the
czma
and
the
ocs
lands
act,
that
these
decisions
of
the
department
of
interior
must
comply
with
consistency
requirements
and
that
they
wanted
a
broad
definition
of
the
directly
affecting
test,
not
a
narrow
definition.
ms.
theodora
berger
your
honor,
under...
that
is
an
interesting
question,
because
under
the
original
bills,
the
language
in
both
versions
was
in
the
coastal
zone.
ms.
theodora
berger
and
they
changed
it
to
directly
affecting.
ms.
theodora
berger
however,
there
is
some
language
in
the
reports
that
we
have
cited
indicating...
and
perhaps
this
is
the
only
explanation
of
the
legislative
history
that
tells
you
why
congress
did
change
to
the
directly
affecting
test.
there
are
statements
in
the
legislative
history
going
back
to
1971
that
congress
always
intended
that
federal
activities,
even
if
the
were
outside
the
coastal
zone,
would
have
to
comply
with
consistency
requirements
if
they
had
a
functional
interrelationship
with
coastal
zone
management.
and,
the
example
that
was
given
in
the
legislative
reports
was
a
situation
between
the
channel
islands
offshore
california
and
the
mainland.
this
is
the
ocs.
that
is
an
area
of
the
ocs.
and,
the
legislative
history
plainly
states
that
that
was
supposed
to
be
covered
by
consistency
review.
so,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
is
the
only
explanation
we
have
of
why
congress
changed
to
this
directly
affecting
test,
because
they
wanted
to
get
at
those
kinds
of
activities.
ms.
theodora
berger
yes,
there
are.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
within
the
coastal
zone
would
not
be
leasing
by
the
department
of
interior.
ms.
theodora
berger
that
is
right.
it
was
would
be
a
state--
ms.
theodora
berger
--that
is
correct.
ms.
theodora
berger
i
might
as
well
continue
with
the
legislative
history
if
i
may.
in
1976,
congress
amended
the
coastal
zone
management
act
and
at
that
time
it
made
a
number
of
statements
to
the
effect
that
the
department
of
interior's
ocs
leasing
activities
were
always
covered
by
the
act
as
it
existed
in
1972
and
as
in
the
proposed
amendments
in
1976.
now,
petitioners
make
much
of
the
fact
that
in
1976,
section
307(c)(3)(b)
was
added
specifically
directed
to
the
plans
of
exploration
and
development
of
oil
companies.
but,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
conference
report
makes
clear
that
that
was
added
in
order
to
expedite
the
post-leasing
process
to
benefit
the
oil
company.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
pre-leasing
decisions
that
were
made
by
the
department
of
interior.
those
can
only
be
addressed
under
section
307(c)(1).
in
1978,
congress
amended
the
ocs
lands
act
and
established
this
phased
development
that
the
petitioners
rely
on,
but,
again,
the
legislative
history
there
specifically...
on
lease
sales,
they
said
lease
sales
must
comply
with
coastal
zone
management
programs.
they
included
a
savings
clause
saying
that
nothing
in
the
1978
amendments
was
intended
to
modify
in
any
way
the
requirements
of
the
1972
coastal
zone
management
act.
in
1980,
congress
again
amended
the
coastal
zone
management
act
and
made
a
number
of
statements
of
great
import
in
this
case
indicating
that
they
always
intended
interior's
pre-leasing
activities
to
be
covered
and
that
they
wanted
a
broad
test
of
directly
affecting.
ms.
theodora
berger
these
statements,
your
honor,
are
in
the
committee
reports.
and,
i
recognize
that
the
solicitor
argues
that
we
shouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
those
statements,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
very
statements
that
we
rely
on
congress
specifically
linked
to
a
change
that
was
made
in
1980,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
they
amended
a
section,
a
policy
section
of
the
act
in
1980
requiring
the
federal
government
to
cooperate
with
the
states
on
coastal
zone
management
issues.
ms.
theodora
berger
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
what
they
did
do,
however,...
these
reports
were
generated
as
a
result
of
the
year
of
oversight
activity
and
in
that
activity
congress
was
now
dealing
for
the
first
time
with
the
implementation
of
these
state
programs.
ms.
theodora
berger
they
are
post...
well,
not
insofar
as
they
discuss
this
change
that
was
made
in
1980.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
they
said
that
the
broad
definition
of
directly
affecting
was
consistent
with
the
change
that
they
made
in
1980.
ms.
theodora
berger
well,
your
honor,
this
court
certainly
has
given
weight
to
post-enactment
statements
where
they
are
as
relevant
as
these
statements
are.
not
only
that,
congress
did
not
simply
come
up
with
a
new
test
in
1980.
they
said
that
the
functional
interrelationship
test,
which
i
mentioned
going
back
to
1972,
was
always
the
test.
it
is
not
as
though
congress
is
saying
at
a
later
date
we
have
now
discovered
the
test.
instead,
what
they
are
doing
is
saying
this
was
always
the
test.
we
told
you
that
many
years
ago
and
it
still
is
the
test.
but,
another
important
point
is
that
no
coastal
zone
management
programs
were
approved
until
1977.
so,
the
1980
legislative
history
is
the
first
time
that
congress
was
actually
focusing
on
how
the
process
worked
and
this
is
their
explanation
of
how
section
307(c)(1)
works
and
why
they
didn't
amend
the
act
in
1980.
i
might
point
out
that
the
oil
industry
was
lobbying
heavily
at
that
point
asking
that
the
consistency
requirements
be
changed.
and,
this
was
congress'
explanation
of
why
they
were
not
going
to
change
section.
307(c)(1).
ms.
theodora
berger
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
ms.
theodora
berger
i
certainly
do,
your
honor,
and
i
thank
you
for
giving
me
that
opportunity.
i
think
that
the
table
of
contents
of
one
document
offered
by
petitioners
at
the
last
moment
is
hardly
very
probative,
but
if
the
court
wishes
to
supplement
the
record
in
this
fashion,
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
submit
documents
that
would
disprove
petitioners'
statements
if
that--
ms.
theodora
berger
--i
certainly
do.
ms.
theodora
berger
all
right.
ms.
theodora
berger
i
think,
your
honors,
the
better
course
of
action
would
be
to
keep
the
record
as
we
have
it
and
just
allow
me
to
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
about
cumulative
impacts.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
many
of
the
questions
have
pointed
out
this
morning,
those
impacts
are
best
addressed
at
the
lease
sale
stage.
if
you
are
going
to
put
the
state
in
the
position
where
they
can
only
be
addressed
under
section
307(c)(3),
then
the
state
has
no
choice
but
to
simply
say
we
can't
allow
this
to
go
forward,
we
can't
have
this
tract
developed
because
we
didn't
care
of
this
earlier
on.
if
you
took
care
of
it
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
you
could
impose
stipulations
that
would
allow
the
leasing
to
proceed,
that
it
is
really
too
late
to
take
care
of
these
problems
at
the
exploration
and
development
stage.
