mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
oil
and
gas
leasing
on
the
outer
continental
shelf
occurs
in
four
distinct
stages.
the
first
stage
is
the
preparation
by
the
secretary
of
interior
of
a
five-year
leasing
plan.
it
is
followed
by
the
lease
sale,
exploration,
and
finally
production
and
development.
the
statutes
also
provide
for
step-by-step
decision
making
throughout
these
four
stages
in
a
process
which
has
two
major
aspects.
the
first
aspect
is
that
each
decision
is
made
at
a
time
when
an
optimum
amount
of
information
needed
to
support
that
particular
decision
is
available.
the
second
aspect
is
that
the
decision
to
proceed
through
any
given
stage
of
the
total
ocs
process
does
not
imply
a
commitment
to
any
later
stage.
the
question
in
this
case
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
is
whether
the
substantive
requirement
of
section
307(c)(i)
of
the
coastal
zone
management
act
that
federal
activities
directly
affecting
a
state's
coastal
zone
be
conducted
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
to
the
maximum
extent
practicable
with
approved
state
coastal
zone
management
programs
applies
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
the
second
of
the
four
stages,
in
all
instances.
the
most
helpful
guide
to
what
the
statute
means
is
what
the
statute
says.
what
brings
the
czma's
substantive
requirements
into
play
is
not
a
functional
relationship
or
a
link
in
a
chain
of
events,
it
is
rather
a
direct
effect.
out
of
the
several
accepted
meanings,
dictionary
meanings,
meanings
approved
by
decisions
of
this
court
of
that
word
"direct",
not
one
of
them,
not
one,
supports
the
respondents'
position
in
this
case.
and,
indeed,
the
respondents
have
not
even
suggested
any.
there
are
several
meanings
of
the
word
that
are
directly
helpful
to
the
issue
before
this
court.
among
other
things,
it
is
language
of
proximity,
of
certainty,
of
immanence,
language
that
says
there
will
be
no
intervening
agency
or
event.
just
last
term
in
bowsher
versus
merck
this
court,
in
construing
the
word
"direct"
in
another
context
said,
and
i
am
quoting,
"that
whether
the
reference
that
the
word
obviously.
"
"it
is
plain
from
the
face
of
the
provisions
that
these
are
words
of
limitation
requiring
some
close
connection
between
the
type
of
record
sought
and
the
particular
contract.
"
there
is
the
requirement
of
some
close
connection
between
the
thing
directly
affected
and
the
directly
affecting
entity.
in
any
event,
whether
the
reference
is
to
this
court's
ruling
in
bowsher
or
whether
it
is
to
any
ordinary
dictionary
definition,
it
is
very
clear
that
the
words
"directly
affecting"
are
the
complete
antithesis
of
the
remote
and
speculative
circumstances
that
obtain
at
the
lease
sale
stage
of
outer
continental
shelf
phase
development.
at
that
stage,
it
is
uncertain,
for
example,
whether
there
will
be
any
hydrocarbons
found
at
all;
whether
if
they
are
found,
they
will
be
oil
or
gas
and
how
and
where
they
will
be
brought
ashore.
there
may
be
effects
on
the
coastal
zone
from
what
happens
on
the
outer
continental
shelf,
but
in
this
case
and
almost
all
cases
those
are
effects
from
what
may
or
may
not
happen
years
after
the
lease
sale
at
the
time
of
exploration
or
production
and
development.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
drafted
first
by
the
relevant
state
then
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
for
approval,
then
after
that
that
is
the
charter
with
which
consistency
must
be
determined.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
dozen
or
so.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
and,
they
simply
set
up...
they
vary.
some
of
them
can
be
very
general
and
in
our
view
most
of
them
are
extremely
general.
some
of
them--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--they
can
have
a
certain
amount
of
detail,
but
in
general
they
are
quite
general
and
that
gives
the
state
additional
leadway.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
such
things
as
the
protection
of
the
environment
and
the
protection
of
animal
life
and
so
forth
along
the
coastal
zone
which
is
from
the
shore
and
three
miles
out
to
the
territorial
sea.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course,
the
four
stages
can
come
into
play,
but
the
czma
would
not
come
into
play
until
there
is
such
a--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
a
plan
that
is
adopted
by
the
state,
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
them
approved
by--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
secretary
of
commerce,
that
is
correct.
in
1976
and
1978,
congress
amended
respectively
the
czma
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act.
though
the
hearings
for
the
amendments
to
the
two
statutes
were
held
in
tandem
and
certainly
the
two
have
to
be
considered
in
tandem,
and
it
was
in
those
amendments
that
specific
provision
was
made
for
phased
decision
making.
the
osc
leasing
process
is
one
which,
by
its
very
nature,
lends
itself
to
decision
making
by
stages.
the
total
process
takes
years,
and
in
some
instances,
even
decades,
but
there
are
identifiable
points
along
the
line
at
which
decisions
have
to
be
made
whether
to
proceed
further.
now,
as
an
integral
part
of
this
comprehensive
change
to
phased
decision
making,
congress
provided
in
sections
11
and
25
of
the
ocsla,
added
in
1978,
and
in
section
307(c)(3)(b)
of
the
czma
which
is
the
only
section
that
deals
expressly
with
outer
continental
shelf
transactions.
that
these
consistency
certifications
with
their
substantive
capacity
to
halt
further
development
would
be
made
at
the
exploration
stage
and
at
the
production/development
stage.
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
the
provision
is
different.
that
is
expressly
dealt
with
by
section
19
of
the
ocsla
which
provides
for
state
input
of
information
regarding
the
size,
timing,
and
location,
which,
analogous
to
nepa
the
secretary
of
interior
must
take
into
account
and
must
give
reasons
for
his
rejection
of
the
state's
suggestion.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
at
the
lease
sale
stage,
it
is
surveying,
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
there
can
be
some
drilling
in
connection
with
that,
but
no
one
is
contending
that
that
has
any
environmental...
well,
just
because
of
the
drilling
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
could
be.
in
some
isolated
instances,
you
could
have...
it
is
basically
a
sonar,
seismic
type
soundings
and
you
could
have,
in
some
instances,
a
circumstance
where
the
mere
carrying
on
of
those
surveys
and
those
sound
waves
going
out
could
have
some
effect
on
animals
in
the
area.
but,
this
is
not
that
kind
of
case
and
will
not
be
in
the
great
majority
of
instances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
'76.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
would.
i
certainly
would.
that
is
definitely
our
position.
what
it
refers
to
are
those
instances,
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
was
referring
to
in
my
response
to
justice
brennan
whether,
in
fact,
it
would
be
direct
affect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
except
that
it
bears
on...
the
decision
making
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
knew
at
the
time
it
adopted
it
that
that
provision
for
a
consistency
determination
was
not
already
contained
in
the
earlier
language
adopted
in
307(c)(1).
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
answer
is
yes,
and
it
is
307(c)(1),
but
it
rarely
applies.
it
applies
only
in
those
instances
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
a
direct
effect;
that
is
an
effect
that
does
not
depend
on
any
intervening
agency
coming
into
play.
now,
that
becomes
very
apparent
when
you
look
at
what,
in
fact--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
307(c)(1).
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
it
is
at
page
84a,
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
1976
and
19--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely
nothing
in
our
view.
that
is
correct.
because
the
other
thing
that
the
secretary
has
at
that
exploration
stage
is
the
authority
to
stop.
up
until
that
point,
he
must
take
into
account
the
views,
and
if
there
is
a
direct
effect,
he
stops
it
then.
that
is
the
other
essential
feature
of
osc
phased
development.
at
the
exploration
stage,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
oil
companies
have
vast
amounts
of
money
involved,
he
can
nevertheless
say
or
nevertheless,
if
at
that
stage,
the
state
determines
that
it
is
inconsistent,
that,
in
and
of
itself,
stops
the
development.
the
state
can
do
it
all
by
itself.
now,
there
is
authority
in
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
override
in
the
event
that
he
makes
an
overriding
decision.
but,
in
our
view,
no,
the
state
does
not
lose
by
waiting
until
the
later
stage.
what
happened
in
'76
and
'78
was
that
in
the
initial
phases
of
the
congressional
consideration,
the
position
that
prevailed
in
both
houses
was
one
which
was
identical
to
the
positions
favored
by
the
respondents
here;
that
is
that
the
consistency
determination,
the
consistency
certification,
would
have
to
be
made
at
the
lease
sale
stage.
in
both
houses
there
were
proposals
to
that
effect
that
were
introduced
and,
during
the
initial
stages,
they
were
the
ones
that
prevailed.
however,
they
were
never
enacted
into
law.
there
was...
the
word
307(c)(3)(b).
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
if
there
had
never
been
the
subsequent...
the
result
still
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
my
reliance
on
what
happened
in
'76
and
'78
simply...
strengthens
our
view
as
to
(c)(1).
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
debates,
the
executive
branch
expressed
its
concerned
that
at
the
lease
sale
stage
we
simply
don't
know
enough.
and,
if
you
will
look
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
congress
shared
that
view.
they
shared
that
concern
that
the
leases
were
being
stopped
at
the
lease
sale
stage
and
as
a
consequence
they
opted
for
the
phased
development.
the
net
result
was
that
the
original
language,
which
included
leases
within
its
consistency
certifications
requirements,
was
dropped
and
in
its
place
or
instead
rather
section
307(c)(3)(b)
was
added.
it
was
a
new
section.
it
is
the
only
part
of
the
entire
statute
that
deals
with
ocs
transactions.
and,
as
a
net
result,
the
provisions
of
the
czma
which
deal
with
czma
applicability
to
ocs
transactions
are
identical
to
the
provisions
of
the
ocsla
dealing
with
czma
applicability
to
ocs
transactions
namely,
that
czma's
substantive
requirements
apply
only
at
the
exploration
and
production
and
development
stages
and
that
is
what
expressly
section
307(c)(3)(b)
says
in
the
czma
and
that
is
what
sections
11,
19,
and
25
of
the
ocsla
says.
and,
any
other
view
puts
these
two
necessarily
related
statutes
out
of
sync
with
each
other.
at
the
lease
sale
stage
what
happens
is
it
is
a
procedural
requirement
of
coordination,
involvement,
cooperation
that
the
secretary
is
required
to
consider,
but
there
is
no
substantive
authority
to
stop
the
project.
now,
the
respondent's
contention
is
that
a
czma
obligation
at
the
lease
sale
stage
is
imposed
on
the
federal
government
by
the
directly
affecting
language
and
this
gets
to
justice
steven's
question.
there
are
at
least
two
flaws
in
that
argument.
the
first
one
is
that
it
flies
in
the
face
of
what
the
statute
says
for
reasons
already
discussed,
means
direct.
it
simply
cannot
mean
something
that
may
or
may
not
come
about
depending
on
events
which
have
not
yet
occurred.
that
is
an
undisputed
description
of
the
lease
sale
circumstance
and
it
fits
no
definition
of
the
word
"direct".
second,
if
congress...
if
the
reason
that
congress
eliminated
the
blanket
requirement
of
consistency
determinations
at
the
lease
sale
stage
from
the
only
part
of
the
statute
that
expressly
deals
with
ocs
transactions
after
months
of
consideration
of
the
issue
was
because
of
some
sudden
discovery
that
it
was
already
contained
in
another
part
of
the
act
that
was
already
in
existence,
congress
surely
would
have
said
so.
if
section
307(c)(1),
which
is
the
directly
affecting
section,
already
contained
a
czma
lease
sale
requirement,
why
did
congress
give
such
extensive
consideration
to
whether
that
self
same
requirement
should
be
written
in
the
ocs
subsection?
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
that
so
much
as
hints
that
the
reason
that
leasing
was
not
included,
indeed,
was
deleted
from
section
307(c)(b)
was
redundancy.
it
was
rather
impracticability,
incompatibility
with
the
phased
development
of
the
ocs
that
was
the
centerpiece.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
i
know.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
there
is
only
one
footnote
prior
to
1980
that
really
supports
that
proposition.
that
is
footnote
52
in
1977.
and,
that
is
consistent.
what
we
think
that
refers
to
is
our
view,
as
i
have
already
explained
it,
that
there
will
be
some
direct
effects
in
some
instances
and
in
those
cases
it
will
apply
to
the
leasing
stage.
the
1980
legislative
history,
i
think
my
answer
is
obvious.
those
were
simply
the
views
of
some
individual
congressmen
concerning
their
interpretation
of
what
an
earlier
congress
meant.
that
is
not
legislation.
that
is
not
the
proper
function
for
congress
to
play.
the
only
way
that
congress
can
change
the
law
is
by
passage
by
two
houses
and
signature
by
the
president.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
the
answer
to
that
question,
i
now
yield
to
the
lessee.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
chief
justice
burger,
a
public
document
clearly
subject
to
judicial
notice,
which
i
think
may
be
of
help
to
the
court,
staff
recommendation
to
the
california
coastal
commission,
file
no.
cc-783,
which
reviews
recommendations
at
the
production
and
development
stages
for
exxon.
the
table
of
contents
contains,
among
other
things,
references
to
cumulative
impacts
at
the
production
stage.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
will
be
happy
to
make
it
available
to
the
court.
pages
53
through
56
deal
with
this
subject
citing
section
30250
of
the
coastal
act
which
refers
at
the
development
stage
to
significant
adverse
effects,
either
individually
or
cumulatively,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
talk
for
the
next
three
pages
about
cumulative
impacts
at
the
development
stage.
in
fact,
these--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
i
have
not,
justice
blackmun,
but
it
is...
in
fact,
it
just
recently
came
to
my
attention,
but
it
is
a
public
document
of
the
state
of
california
and
it
is
subject
to
judicial
notice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
in
response
to
the
assertion
that
cumulative
impacts
simply
cannot...
that
it
is
too
late
at
the
development
stage.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
how
long
have
i
had
it?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
really
don't
know.
it
was
called
to
my
attention
just
a
couple
of
days
ago.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
sense
that
you
have
this
problem
of
the
investment
already
having
been
made.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but,
i
see
no
reason...
i
see
no
reason
why
it
would
be
any
more
difficult
at
the
development
stage
to
say
we
now
know,
based
on
other
facts
that
have
developed
during
the
interim
that
there
are
these
cumulative
impacts
and
we
are
going
to
take
those
into
account.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
of
the
difference
between
the...
what
happens
at
the
early
stage,
at
the
lease
sale
stage
under
section
19,
which
provides
for
input,
and
the
substantive
requirement...
the
result
of
the
substantive
requirement
once
the
determination
of
no
consistency
is
issued
by
the
relevant
state.
at
the
early
stage,
it
is
a
matter
of
coordination,
of
long-range
planning.
that
was
provided
for
by
section
18
at
the
five-year
plan
stage
and
by
section
19
at
the
lease
sale
stage.
but,
once
you
pass
that,
then
you
are
out
of
simply
cooperation,
coordination,
and
then
it
is
a
question
of
the
authority
substantively
to
stop
the
project.
as
mr.
bruce
indicated,
there
have
been
only
two
or
three
of
these
appeals
for
the
secretary
of
commerce
to
override
thus
far,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
none
of
those
have
been
successful.
and,
with
regard
to
307(c)(1),
significant
we
think,
there
is
no
authority
of
the
secretary
of
commerce
override.
one
of
the
obvious
reasons...
the
reason
in
my
view
is
simply
that
it
was
not
intended
that
the...
the
certification
requirement
was
not
intended
to
apply
at
that
stage.
