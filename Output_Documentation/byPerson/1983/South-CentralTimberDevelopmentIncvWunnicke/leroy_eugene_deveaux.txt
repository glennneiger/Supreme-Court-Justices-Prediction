mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
are
basic
commerce
clause
issues:
can
a
state,
in
selling
natural
resources
to
private
parties,
insist
that
those
resources
be
processed
before
the
resources
can
be
shipped
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce?
can
congress'
consent
to
such
a
restraint
be
implied
from
a
u.s.
forest
service
policy
governing
federally
owned
natural
resources?
the
facts
of
this
case
are
clear
and
they
are
not
in
dispute.
in
1980
the
state
of
alaska
noticed,
sent
out
prospectuses
and
sample
contracts
offering
to
sell
49
million
board-feet
of
mixed
spruce
and
hemlock
in
icy
bay,
alaska.
a
special
condition
to
the
contract
in
this
case
stated
that
before
the
logs
out
of
this
sale
could
be
shipped
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
they
must
be
primarily
processed.
the
state
reason
for
primary
processing
is
to
encourage
in-state
construction
of
lumber
mills
and
to
support
existing
lumber
mills
within
the
state.
south-central,
a
bidder
and
a
potential
bidder
in
this
case,
cuts,
sells,
and
ships
logs
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
particularly,
in
fact
virtually
all
of
them,
in
foreign
commerce
to
japan,
and
that
is
noted
even
in
the
state's
brief
at
page
34.
at
the
time
of
this
sale,
south-central
did
not
at
that
time
have
a
functioning
mill
within
the
state
of
alaska.
the
first
question
that
probably
should
be
addressed
is
whether
congress
has
consented
to
state
activity
which
would
otherwise
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
district
court,
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
the
state
of
alaska
in
this
court
have
all
conceded
that
congress
has
not
expressly
consented
to
the
primary
manufacturing
or
primary
processing
requirement
at
issue
in
this
case.
instead,
the
ninth
circuit
created
a
novel
doctrine
of
implied
consent,
saying
in
effect
that
federal
consent
can
be
implied
from
forest
service
policies
governing
only
national
forests.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
is
simply
wrong
and
this
court
has
never
so
held.
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
this
argument...
in
its
argument
will
deal
primarily
with
the
consent
question
and
with
the
foreign
commerce
question.
under
traditional
commerce
clause
analysis,
this
case
would
be
easily
dealt
with.
we
have
a
case
of
requiring
in-state
processing
or
in-state
manufacturing
before
an
item
of
commerce
can
be
shipped
out
of
the
state.
traditionally
this
court
has
held
that
those
kinds
of
regulations,
those
kinds
of
requirements,
are
virtually
per
se
unconstitutional
and
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
but
the
state
raised
an
issue,
and
has
continually
raised
that
issue
until
this
very
time,
that
it
fits
within
a
narrow
exception,
a
doctrine
called
the
market
participation
exception
to
commerce
clause
scrutiny.
we
must
first
look
at
what
this
case
is
not.
it
is
not
a
case
of
a
state
manufacturing
a
good.
it
is
not
a
state
just
concerned
with
interstate
commerce,
but
predominantly
foreign
commerce.
it
is
not
a
simple
refusal
to
deal
or
to
choose
who
one
is
to
deal
with.
it
is
not
a
case
where
the
state
has
taken
any
great
risk,
used
its
own
industry
or
foresight,
or
expended
any
great
labor
or
entered
into
a
complex
process.
it
is
not
a
case
of
police
power
for
health,
welfare,
the
safety
of
its
citizens.
it
is
not
a
case
of
a
traditional
governmental
function
or
state
sovereignty.
it
is
not
a
case
of
cleaning
up
roads
or
building
public
projects.
and
it's
not
a
case
where
the
state
created
any
market.
the
state
of
alaska
is
simply
not
a
market
participant
in
any
normal
or
theoretical
sense
of
the
word.
alaska
argues
in
its
brief
that
it's
simply
a
seller
of
timber,
and
you
can
find
that
in
their
brief
at
page
28.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
it
does.
what
it's
saying
in
effect
by
saying
that
is
that
it's
a
simple
seller
of
timber
when
it
requires
someone
to
process
it
downstream.
if
they
were
a
simple
seller
of
timber,
your
honor,
would
they
forego
over
90
percent
of
the
value
of
that
timber
in
cash
for
some
political
or
social
function
for
the
state
that
no
seller
of
timber
in
the
private
marketplace
would
do?
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
in
the
state's
brief,
in
its
appendix,
pages...
i
believe
it's
page
a-8...
when
later
looking
to
sell
the
same
timber
the
state
forester,
the
state
expert
in
this
area,
states
in
numbered
paragraph
3:
"increased
revenue.
"
"the
revenue
to
the
state
by
not
requiring
primary
manufacture
will
be
substantially
increased
from
$216,000
to
$2,440,000.
"
and
as
that
sale
has
been
completed,
the
state
made
a
woefully
small
estimate.
in
fact,
it
increased
more
than
twice
the
amount
that
they
estimated.
so
we're
talking
about
something
in
the
neighborhood
between
$4
million
and
$6
million.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
i
think
they
somehow
could
do
that.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
because
to
encourage
in-state
processing
rather
than
discouraging
business
from
exporting
logs
in
the
round
are
entirely
different
matters.
this
state
has
always
looked...
this
court
has
always
looked
with
great
scrutiny
and
care
where
states
have
required
some
kind
of
activity
to
be
taken
within
the
state.
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
that
a
state
can't
encourage
industrial
development,
and
using
money
to
encourage
it
is
one
thing.
building
a
barrier
at
the
border
is
another.
i
think
those
are
entirely
different
matters.
did
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
i'm
sure
that's
true.
i
hope
it
answers
your
question,
i
should
say.
they
are
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
what
a
normal
market
participant
would
do.
no
business
would
give
away
90
percent
of
its
value
in
its
natural
resource
that
it
was
selling
for
some
social
end.
in
fact,
justice
powell
noted
in
his
dissent
in
reeves
that
states
are
oftimes
and
will
often
look
to
different
ends
than
a
normal
market
participant
would
look
at
or
a
private
enterprise.
let
me
make
the
point
more
precisely,
maybe.
in
a
free
market
environment
with
this
particular
resource,
logs,
timber,
if
you
will,
logs
are
hauled
from
where
they
are
cut
down
to
a
mill
site,
and
they
are
put
in
at
one
end
of
the
mill
and
they
come
out
the
other
end
of
the
mill
as
finished
lumber.
all
the
lumber
that
can
be
made
out
of
that
log
that
the
market
needs
at
that
time
based
on
that
particular
piece
of
wood
will
be
made.
not
so
with
what
the
state
has
done
here.
they've
created
an
artificial
second
milling.
in
other
words,
instead
of
having
a
one-step
process
we
have
now
a
two-step
process.
the
logs
now
come
into
mill
and
are
cut
up
into
chunks
of
wood
8-3/4
inches
thick,
and
then
have
to
be
shipped
to
another
mill
where
the
finished
products
are
made.
i
cannot
see
under
those
kinds
of
facts
how
the
state
can
say
they
are
simple
market
participants,
particularly
when
you
take
and
do
this
two-step
tier
that
does
not
exist
in
the
normal
marketplace,
that
the
value
of
the
log
is
less
when
it
comes
out
of
the
first
tier
than
it
was
when
it
went
in,
and
that
i
refer
the
court
to
the
kenai
lumber
briefs
in
the
lower
court
which
in
fact
say
that
is
true,
and
they
are
an
intervenor
on
the
side
of
the
state.
that
is
why
the
price
differential
is
so
great.
the
logs
are
worth
so
much
less
and
so
much
more
difficult
to
market
after
they
have
had
this
primary
manufacturing.
all
this
is
clear
from
a
memorandum
attached
to
the
state's
brief.
again
referring
to
the
state's
addendum
or
appendix
to
their
brief,
page
5,
we're
discussing
primary
manufacture:
"primary
manufacturing
policy
limits
the
options
of
the
logging
industry
in
marketing
their
products
on
the
world
market.
"
further,
on
page
8
of
that
same
gentleman's
memorandum
to
the
state
he
says:
"since
the
sale
is
appraised
to
be
competitive,
anyone
in
the
private
sector
can
bid
on
it.
"
"this
gives
a
much
larger
segment
of
the
forest
products
industry
an
opportunity
to
bid
on
that
sale.
"
and
then
it
follows
in
the
very
next
paragraph,
again
refers
to
the
rate
differential
in
plus.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
the
federal
government
owns
the
majority,
and
i
believe
20
percent
is
owned
by
the
state,
and
some
of
those
are
in
the
interior,
which
at
some
time
in
the
future...
those
are
primarily
white
spruce
forests...
will
be
of
great
value.
75
percent
i
believe
is
owned
by
the
federal
government
and
then
a
very
small
percentage
is
in
private
hands,
principally
the
natives
and
some
small
holdings.
how
can
the
state,
when
its
own
forester,
their
own
expert,
puts
forth
such
evidence,
state
that
this
is
a
market
participant,
that
they
are
merely
a
seller
of
timber?
what
this
case
really
is
is
a
case
of
downstream
economic
control
of
a
milling
business.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--if
it
had
a
functioning
mill.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
that's...
i
don't
know
that
it
couldn't
lease
it
out.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
could.
what
they
could
do
is
make
an
incentive
so
that
someone
in
the
private
sector
would
find
it
both
efficient
and
expedient
or
economically
feasible
to
do
it.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
it's
not
our
case,
but
in
attempting
to
answer
the
justice's
question--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--yes,
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
is
a
much
closer
question
than
the
one
we
have.
i
don't
believe
this
is
at
all
a
close
question.
this
is
more,
the
case
we
have
is
more
akin
to
what
happened
in
foster-fountain
packing
company,
where
the
state
of
louisiana--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--yes,
it
does,
and
it
forces
the
timber
company
who
purchases
those
logs
to
deal
with
a
competitor,
if
you
will,
and
to
ship
those
logs
to
a
competitor
if
he
buys
them,
or
not
to
buy
at
all,
or
to
expend
great
funds
to
build
a
mill
within
the
state
when
it
could
be
more
efficiently
done
wherever
the
logs
are
going,
the
lumber
is
going
to
be
used
for
its
ultimate
purpose.
and
i
think
that's
the
basic
problem
with
this
case,
is
that
it
forces
something
to
be
done
that
could
be
more
efficiently
done
somewhere
else.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
i
think
that's
very
similar
to
the
cases
involving
natural
gas,
which
are
very
early
cases
in
this
century,
principally
the
kansas
natural
gas
case
and
also
the
case
of
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
but
this
court
has
always
said
something's
different
about
natural
resources,
and
there's
been
a
continual
comment
that
something
is
different--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--the
reeves
case
poses
a
question
on
that,
but
even
in
the
reeves
case
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
agreed
about
one
thing:
that
somehow
natural
resources
were
different
and
they
had
to
be
treated
different,
because
they
go
to
the
very
basis
for
the
commerce
clause
itself.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
it
did.
if
the
state
made
the
lumber
here
i
think
they
could
sell
it
to
whomever
they
wish.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
well,
i
hope
so.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
but
still,
natural
resources
are
by
happenstance
within
the
state.
even
if
they're
timber,
they're
only
there
because
that
was
the
luck
of
the
draw.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
sometimes
those
can
be
non-renewable
if
you
overfish
them.
put
they
again
are
the
same
thing,
and
this
court
has
said
in
hughes
versus
oklahoma
that
that's
hanging
on
an
awful
slender
reed
when
we
say
that
the
fish
are
owned.
they're
owned
by
who
catches
them,
and
i
think
the
court
is
correct.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
little
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
thank
you,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
i
hope
not
to
even
use
them,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
come
back
to
the
same
thing.
that's
in
fact
what
they're
doing.
either
you
sell
it
to
someone
who
is
required
to
use
an
in-state
processing
plant
or--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--you're
saying
a
simple
refusal
to
deal
kind
of
situation?
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
the
court
has--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--that's
right.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
right.
i
think
in
that
case
the
court
would
have
to
look
behind
at
their
motives,
and
i
think
we're
dealing
with
a
natural
resources,
and
that
would
be
the
same
if...
in
fact,
i
believe
that
footnote
31
of
our
reply
brief
addresses
that
kind
of
question
from
a
different
point
of
view.
what
if
it
was
something
other
than
timber?
the
state
has
every
intention,
it
would
seem
from
the
regulations,
to
require
this
over
other
natural
resources.
in
fact,
in
royalty
oil
and
gas
or
gas
liquids,
we
have
the
same
requirement.
they've
just
changed
the
name
from
timber
to
oil
and
gas.
now,
that
would
be
the
same
kind
of
thing
to
require
to
sell
those
natural
resources
only
to
an
in-state
processor.
and
the
question
i
have
there
is
something
from
reeves,
is
that
when
a
person
buys
it
could
he
then
not
process
it
at
his
processing
plant,
his
timber
facility
if
he
had
it,
and
ship
it
away?
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
no,
i
think
that's
a
very
much
closer
question
and
certainly
would
be
more
difficult
to
deal
with.
you
would
have
to
look
behind
that.
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
yes,
that
is
like
the--
mr.
leroy
eugene
deveaux
--the
place
for
commerce
and
the
antitrust
laws
to
get
together
is
not
to
stop
competition,
is
to
allow
competition,
and
i
think
the
refusal
to
deal
is
a
much
more
difficult
question
to
deal
with.
there
is
something...
one
of
the
questions
asked
by
the
court
is
round
log
shipping.
you
cannot
ship
blocks
of
wood,
you
cannot
float
them.
once
you've
decided
to
primary
manufacture
them,
they
must
be
dry-handled
all
the
time,
and
they
become
very
difficult
to
deal
with.
you
can
get
them
into
the
ship,
but
you
can't
put
any
on
the
decks
because
they'll
get
wet,
and
logs
that
have
been
primarily
manufactured
are
no
longer
safe.
and
my
time
is
up.
