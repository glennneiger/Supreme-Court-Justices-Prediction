mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
stress
a
few
facts
for
the
court
and
then
outline
briefly
the
three
legal
points
which
i
will
be
urging
upon
the
court
today.
the
requirement
of
primary
manufacture
on
public
lands
in
alaska
has
been
in
existence
for
over
50
years.
it
was
adopted
at
a
time
when
the
state
of
alaska
was
not
a
state;
it
was
a
federal
territory.
but
the
purpose
at
that
time
was
to
encourage
the
development
of
a
timber
processing
industry
in
the
remote
coastal
regions
of
alaska.
that
policy
for
primary
manufacture
in
the
national
forests
in
alaska
continues
today
under
regulations
of
the
forest
service
which
have
the
explicit
purpose
of
keeping
and
assuring
that
there
is
a
continued
existence
of
a
forest
processing
industry
in
alaska.
the
effect
of
the
federal
policy
has
been
at
least
twofold.
first
of
all,
it
has
provided
an
economic
basis
for
the
development
of
communities
in
rural
southeast
alaska;
and
secondly,
coupled
with
the
primary
manufacture
requirement
imposed
on
other
federal
timber
exports
in
the
pacific
northwest,
it
has
had
the
effect
of
creating
a
market
for
processed
timber
with
a
number
of
pacific
rim
nations
for
both
pulp
and
for
cants.
since
statehood,
alaska
has
itself
enunciated
a
primary
manufacture
requirement
for
sales
from
state
land.
the
purpose
of
the
state
requirement
is
identical
to
that
of
the
federal
requirement.
it
is
to
keep
the
timber
industry
in
the
remote
areas
of
coastal
alaska
in
operation
and
to
keep
the
communities
which
depend
on
them
both
socially
and
economically
in
existence.
the
three
points
which
i
will
cover
today
are:
first
of
all,
that
we
do
believe
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct
when
it
found...
impliedly
found
congressional
consent
to
the
state's
primary
manufacture
requirement.
secondly--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--no,
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
take
that
position.
it
simply
applies
to
public
timber
in
this
case,
state
as
well
as
federal
timber.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
there
would
certainly
be
an
argument
that
there
is
a
burden.
whether
it
would
be
illegal
or
not,
obviously
we
would
argue
in
a
different
case.
i
think
under
the
various
natural
gas
cases
that
have
been
decided
that,
unless
alaska
could
show
some
independent
policy
power
or
safety
justification
for
the
requirement,
that
it
probably
would
not
be.
even
if
there
has
not
been
congressional
consent
to
the
state's
requirement
here,
we
believe
that
the
state
is
in
fact
a
market
participant
and
is
therefore
not
subject
to
the
commerce
clause.
and
thirdly,
even
if
ultimately
it
is
determined
that
the
state
is
not
a
market
participant,
but
is
subject
to
the
commerce
clause,
we
believe
that
the
primary
manufacture
requirement
imposed
by
the
state
of
alaska
satisfies
traditional
commerce
clause
analysis.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
at
a
request
for
bids.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
well,
the
sale
and
title
are
two
different...
the
sale
is
complete
at
the
time
the
contract
is
signed.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
sale
is
complete
at
the
time
the
contract
is
signed.
title
is
passed
at
the
time
that
the
logs
are
cut
and--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--payment
is
made
after
they
are
cut
and
cleaned
and
i
believe
removed.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
a
term
of
the
contract.
the
petitioners
and
both
the
solicitor
general
have
argued
with
respect
to
this
question
of
implied
consent
that
this
court
has
required
in
a
number
of
cases
that
this
consent
must
be
express
and
clear,
and
they
have
cited
cases
for
that
proposition.
but
the
real
inquiry
that
this
court
has
applied
in
the
past,
and
we
believe
is
the
inquiry
which
should
continue
to
be
applied,
is
whether
or
not...
well,
the
question
is
really
what
did
congress
have
in
mind,
what
was
its
intent
in
a
particular
area.
and
we
think
that,
therefore,
the
issue
is
not
whether
congress
properly
expressed
its
intent,
but
really
the
underlying
question
is
in
fact
what
its
intent
was.
for
instance,
i
can
give
the
court
a
couple
of
examples
where
congress
has
not
itself
spoken
clearly,
but
yet
where
this
court
has
approved
what
would
otherwise
be
considered
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
last
year
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
white
case,
the
court
approved
the
city
of
boston's
requirement
for
local
employment
when
it
was
challenged
with
respect
to
the
use
of
federal
funds
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
a
federal
regulation
adopted
by
a
federal
agency
which
required
that
preference.
there
was
no
express
congressional
requirement
or
permission
for
the
preference.
similarly,
in
the
case
of
marion
versus
hicarilla
apache
tribe,
this
court
found
consent
as
the
result
of
a
scheme
of
federal
checkpoints
established
by
federal
officials,
and
again
not
something
that
was
established
expressly
by
congress.
the
ninth
circuit
examined
the
record
and
the
legislation
and
the
legislative
history
and
determined,
upon
taking
them
as
a
whole,
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
requirement
of
primary
manufacture
for
public
timber,
that
it
had
determined
that
such
a
policy
was
in
the
national
interest,
and
that
it
intended
that
the
state
of
alaska
as
well
as
the
federal
government
be
able
to
impose
primary
manufacture
in
selling
its
timber.
now,
despite
assertions
by
both
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general
to
the
contrary,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
congress
does
and
has
expressly
and
clearly
indicated
its
view
that
a
primary
manufacture
requirement
for
national
forest
timber
in
alaska
is
in
both
the
nation's
and
alaska's
interests.
although
we
have
not
referred
to
it
as
clearly
as
we
might
have
in
our
brief,
the
clearest
and
most
recent
expression
of
congressional
concern
regarding
the
local
interests
at
stake
in
alaska
and
the
health
of
the
timber
industry
is
the
alaska
national
interest
lands
conservation
act
of
1980.
that
can
be
found
as
public
law
96-481,
and
we
would
refer
the
court
in
particular
to
sections
705
and
706.
those
sections
call
upon
the
united
states
forest
service
to
monitor
and
report
to
congress
on
an
annual
basis
on
the
timber
supply
and
demand
that
is
available
in
southeast
alaska
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
there
is
an
approximately
450
million
board
foot
availability
of
public
timber,
national
timber,
which
is
available
to
dependent
industry...
and
"dependent
industry"
is
the
language
of
the
statute...
in
that
area.
funds
are
provided
by
congress
in
section
705
for
that
express
purpose.
a
further
record
of
congress'
concern
and
its
purpose
in
adopting
these
provisions
in
the
alaska
national
interest
lands
conservation
act
can
be
found
in
house
report
96-97,
part
1
at
page
504,
and
senate
report
96-413
at
page
399.
there
both
the
house
and
senate
committees
respectively
describe
that
maintaining
the
timber
industry
employment
in
southeast
alaska
was
"an
overriding
consideration
of
both
committees.
"
other
specific
references
to
the
need
for
primary
manufacture
in
southeast
alaska
to
provide
jobs
in
the
local
alaska
economies
can
be
found
at
pages
398
and
401
of
the
senate
report.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i'm
quite
sure
that
would
be
the
case,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
processing...
in
most
cases,
we're
talking
about
either
reducing
the
logs
to
pulp
for
processing
as
pulp
or
we
are
talking
about
reducing
it
into
large
slabs
of
wood,
usually
four-sided,
which
are
referred
to
as
cants
and
are
usually
somewhere
in
the
area
of
10
to
15
feet
long.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no.
those
are
then
used
in
turn
to
process
into
smaller
pieces
of
finished
grade
material.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
it
would
be
exported
on
ships
and
most
of
it
would
likely
go
to
japan,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
if
it
had
been
made
into
pulp...
there
are
two
pulp
plants
in
southeast
alaska.
one
is
owned
by
the
japanese
and
most
of
that
pulp
goes
to
japan.
the
other
is
owned
by
an
american
company
and
most
of
that
is
distributed,
both
in
the
international
and
the
national
market.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
correct.
your
honor,
what's
really
at
issue
here
is
the
cant
market,
not
the
pulp
market.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
your
honor,
i
don't
actually
know
what
the
facts
are.
it's
been
represented
to
me
that
it
is
more
economical
to
ship
cants
than
it
is
to
ship
round
logs.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
well,
it's
the
efficiency
of
the
processing
process
itself,
not
the
transportation.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
well,
to
process
them
into
cants,
yes.
i
had
to
take...
you're
asking
me
to
take
the
position
of
south-central
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--well,
south-central
is
upset
because
they
don't
have
a
processing
facility
in
the
state
and
therefore
would
not
have
been
able
to
bid
on
this
contract.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
on
a
purely
financial
return
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
don't
believe
any
go
to
canada,
but
i
have--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--i
understand
that
some
are
barged
every
now
and
then
to
the
northwestern
washington
area,
but
not
to
canada.
i'm
not
sure
that
canada
would
accept
the
import.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
well--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--there
are
various
ways
to
describe
the
market.
our
position
is
that
we
are
participating
in
the
processed
timber
market.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
alaska
does
not
own
any
manufacturing
facilities,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
no.
we
own
the
good
which
is
then
processed.
we
own
and
sell
the
good
which
is
processed.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
at
this
time
we
do
not.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
as
presently
written,
that's
correct.
we
could
always
amend
the
contract
or
rewrite
our
contract
to
provide
for
title
passing
after
the
processing,
i
suspect.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
to
the
extent
that
we
could
enforce
that
requirement
as
a
result
of
privity,
i
believe
yes,
it
would
be
valid.
to
the
extent
that
that
requirement
could
not
be
enforced
within
the
terms
of
a
contract...
i
think
the
real
answer
as
a
practical
answer
is
that
no
one
would
bid
on
timber
if
they
had
to
turn
it
into
furniture
in
alaska.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
your
honor,
i'm
sure
there
would
be
some
limit.
how
far
that
limit
goes
beyond
market
contract
privity,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
it
would
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
just
how
the
transaction,
the
sale
transaction,
was
constructed.
i
think
there
becomes
a
practical
problem,
which
is
it
becomes
impossible
to
construct
a--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--not
under
the
state's
processing
requirements,
your
honor,
no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
we
certainly
would
take
that
position.
yes,
i
believe
it
would
be.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
well,
i
think
again
the
limit
becomes
one
of
how
the
transaction
was
structured.
if
we
had
a
transaction
which
was
structured
as
a
result
of
imposing
direct
contractual
obligations
on
the
purchaser
which
that
purchaser
himself
had
to
aside
by,
i
think
that's
how
far
we
could
structure
it.
if
we
create
a
situation
where
the
purchaser
ultimately
becomes
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
others,
i
think
that's
when
we
as
a
market
participant
lose,
or
begin
to
lose
certainly,
the
basis
for
the
argument
that
we
are
just
another
trader.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
certainly,
your
honor,
we
could
refuse
to
sell
logs
at
all,
and
i
think
we
could
certainly
refuse
to
sell--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--i
think
we
could
do
that
as
long
as
they're
our
logs.
again,
as
a
practical
matter
we'd
never
sell
any
logs.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
certainly
would,
depending
on
your
definition
of
alaska
processor.
we've
got
a
different
problem,
i
think,
if
we're
talking
about
a
resident
alaska
processor
as
opposed
to
a
company
which
is
present
in
the
state.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
yes,
i
think
in
that
case
we
could
do
it.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
i
think
in
that
case
we
could
do
it.
alaska's
primary
manufacture
requirement
parallels
that
of
the
federal
government,
both
in
its
purpose
and
in
its
effect,
and
given
the
50-year
history
of
the
federal
requirement
for
primary
manufacture
in
alaska,
that
in
1980
congress
clearly
intended
and
expected
that
primary
manufacture
on
forest
service
land
in
alaska
promote
local
economic
activity,
coupled
with
the
existence
of
alaska's
own
longstanding
primary
manufacture
requirement,
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
fairly
and
properly
inferred
that
congress
also
intended,
and
perhaps
congress
may
also
have
expected,
that
the
state
of
alaska
would
be
able
to
impose
the
same
kind
of
primary
manufacturing
requirement.
the
position
of
both
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general
with
regard
to
explicit
consent
causes
us
to
be
a
little
bit
concerned
in
that
it
creates
what
we
think
is
a
troubling
asymmetry
with
traditional
preemption
analysis.
on
the
one
hand
it
is
argued
with
respect
to
commerce
clause
that
in
order
for
a
power
to
be
granted
to
a
state
it
must
be
expressly
stated.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
question
is
whether
or
not
a
power
is
being
withdrawn
from
a
state,
the
traditional
analysis
which
this
congress
has
applied
is:
first,
is
there
express
preemption;
but
secondly,
can
the
court
reasonably
imply
preemption
in
a
particular
situation.
i'm
not
sure
at
all
why
the
rule
should
be
any
different
with
respect
to
inference
as
to
the
particular
action
or
intent
of
congress
when
we
are
talking
about
granting
a
power
as
opposed
to
taking
one
away.
what
is
the
danger
of
inquiring
into
congressional
intent
in
commerce
clause
cases?
we
submit
that
there
is
none.
unlike
a
number
of
other
areas
of
constitutional
jurisprudence,
the
court's
put...
the
court's
decision
on
the
question
of
congressional
consent
is
not
final.
if
congress
disagrees
with
the
court's
decision
and
believes
that
the
court
has
misinterpreted
its
intent,
congress
obviously
can
take
steps
to
rectify
the
misinterpretation.
even
if
the
court
concludes
that
congress
has
not
consented
to
alaska's
primary
manufacture
requirement,
we
believe
that
alaska
is
a
market
participant
and
therefore
exempt
from
commerce
clause
scrutiny.
we
are
as
much
traders
in
timbers
as
south
dakota
was
in
cement
in
reeves,
as
maryland
was
in
hulk
cars
in
alexandria
scrap,
or
as
the
city
of
boston
or
the
city
of
camden
are
in
public
construction
in
either
white
or
camden.
the
applicable
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
is
a
market
participant
was
stated
by
the
court
last
year
in
white,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
alaska's
primary
manufacturing
requirement
covers
a
discrete,
identifiable
class
of
economic
activity
in
which
alaska
is
a
major
participant.
alaska
satisfies
that
test.
as
the
owner
of
the
timber
which
is
sold
subject
to
the
primary
manufacture
requirement,
alaska
is
clearly
a
major
participant
in
the
transaction.
additionally,
the
primary
manufacture
requirement
is
imposed,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
on
the
sale
itself,
so
that
there
is
in
fact
in
this
relationship,
with
respect
to
this
requirement,
formal
privity
of
contract.
as
has
already
been
brought
out,
because
the
state
imposes
this
primary
manufacture
requirement
the
state
does
receive
a
lower
price
for
its
timber
than
it
would
receive
if
it
permitted
timber
to
be
exported
in
the
round.
the
difference
between
those
prices
operates
in
effect
as
a
subsidy
by
the
state
or
a
subsidy
by
the
federal
government,
because
the
federal
government
takes
the
same
reduced
price
for
its
timber
as
a
result
of
its
requirement,
as
a
subsidy
by
the
state
in
support
of
the
continued
existence
of
an
alaska
timber
processing
industry
and
the
communities
which
depend
on
it
both
economically
and
socially.
i
think
in
an
abstract
sense
we
might
characterize
this
subsidy
as
an
alternate
and
presumably
far
better
and
more
desirable
form
of
federal
and
state
welfare.
the
petitioner
claims
that
we
are
not
a
market
participant
because
we
provide
this
subsidy,
and
therefore
we
cannot
be
treated
as
a
private
trader.
but
the
petitioner
we
believe
is
misconstruing
the
thrust
of
the
market
participant
inquiry.
the
correct
inquiry
is
whether
we
are
acting
like
any
private
trader
similarly
situated
could
act,
not
whether
we
act
with
the
same
profit
motives
that
the
private
trader
does.
the
petitioner
has
made
reference
to
findings
of
the
state
forester,
but
i
would
like
to
make
clear
the
state
forester
does
not
have
the
job
or
the
responsibility
of
making
social
policy
in
alaska.
that
the
rule
suggested
by
petitioner
is
incorrect
can
be
quickly
seen
by
considering
the
activity
of
the
involved
governments
in
the
other
market
participant
cases
which
this
court
has
addressed.
in
alexandria
scrap,
what
private
trader
would
pay
more
for
a
wreck
than
it's
worth?
in
the
reeves
case,
what
private
trader
would
allocate
scarce
cement
on
any
basis
other
than
price?
and
in
the
white
case,
what
private
trader
would
make
a
decision
as
to
whom
to
hire
on
a
construction
project
other
than
who
was
the
most
qualified
for
the
job?
both
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
have
suggested
that
there
is
something
constitutionally
significant
about
state-owned
natural
resources
which
requires
denying
a
state
market
participant
status
when
it
is
disposing
of
those
resources.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
as
a
result
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction,
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
there
may
be
a
distinction,
but
i
don't
think
it's
important.
i
don't
think
it
rises
to
legal
levels.
certainly,
if
you
look
at
the
white
case,
the
requirement
there
was
imposed
on
the
building
contractor,
but
the
requirement
was
that
he
agree
to
hire
certain
people.
here
what
we
are
doing
is
imposing
a
requirement
on
a
timber
cutter
that
he
agree
to
cut
the
logs
in
the
state.
in
other
words,
we
are
imposing,
just
as
in
white,
we
are
imposing
this.
you
might
refer
to
it
as
a
second
tier
requirement,
but
it
is
still
within
the
privity
of
the
contract
itself.
it
is
a
contractual
term
required.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
correct,
but
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--that's
certainly
correct.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
that's
not
correct,
your
honor,
because
that
function
could
certainly
be
subcontracted
out
to
an
existing
processor.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
we
put
potential
purchasers
on
notice
at
the
time
of
the
sale--
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
--we
don't
choose
the
customer
at
all.
we
indicate
the
terms
upon
which
we
are
willing
to
sell
our
timber.
mr.
ronald
w.
lorensen
the
distinction
which
has
been
proposed
between
manufactured
goods
and
natural
resources
is
illogical,
we
believe,
and
analytically
unsound.
no
matter
what
the
nature
of
the
good,
they
are
still
state-owned
items.
the
logical
end,
as
some
of
the
questioning
has
indicated,
of
proposing
that
the
market
participant
doctrine
only
be
applied
to
states
who
are
involved
in
manufacturing
goods
is
to
require
the
state
of
alaska
to
develop
its
own
business
bureaucracy
as
a
government
agency
to
cut
the
trees
and
then
process
them
before
it
is
willing
to
sell
them.
if
the
state
can
accomplish
that
result
indirectly,
why
should
the
state
not
be
able...
if
the
state
can
accomplish
that
result
by
doing
it
directly
and
getting
itself
in
the
business
of
cutting
timber,
why
can
the
state
not
accomplish
the
same
result
indirectly?
by
insisting
that
the
state
become
a
processor,
a
government-owned
processor,
in
effect
we
will
end
up
competing
with
the
private
sector
and
potentially
putting
some
of
those
processors
out
of
business,
and
the
only
true
result
we've
obtained
is
to
enlarge
the
size
of
government.
the
proposed
distinction
between
manufactured
goods
and
natural
resources
for
commerce
clause
market
participant
analysis
is
deeply
flawed
and
we
urge
the
court
not
to
adopt
it.
what
about
the
foreign
commerce
issue
that
has
been
raised?
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
make
clear
that
the
assertions
of
the
petitioner
and
the
solicitor
general
that
our
primary
manufacturing
requirement
is
an
export
ban
simply
misconstrues
the
facts.
if
we
actually
banned
the
export
of
timber
from
the
state
of
alaska,
we
would
not
be
able
to
sell
it.
there
simply
is
an
inadequate
market
for
the
timber
within
the
state.
all
interested
parties
understand
when
a
sale
is
proposed
that
alaska's
timber
will
be
exported
from
the
state
when
it
is
sold.
we
only
require
that
before
it
is
exported
it
receive
primary
processing
within
the
state.
this
is
no
more
a
ban
on
the
export
of
timber
than
were
the
price
control
programs
for
raisins,
milk,
or
natural
gas
a
ban
on
the
export
of
those
items
on
sellers
who
might
have
been
willing
to
sell
them
at
a
lower
price
and
export
them
from
their
states
in
the
cases
of
parker
versus
brown,
milk
control
board
versus
eisenberg
at
306
u.s.,
and
cities
services
gas
versus
peerless
at
340
u.s.--
on
the
foreign
commerce
question
itself,
our
position
is
that
as
a
market
participant
the
state's
actions
are
not
subject
to
the
commerce
clause,
whether
that
commerce
is
foreign
or
interstate.
the
state's
status
in
foreign
commerce
is
like
that
of
any
other
private
trader,
and
therefore
it
is
subject
to
the
same
restrictions
that
are
imposed
by
the
federal
government
upon
any
other
private
trader
who
embarks
on
foreign
commerce.
if,
nonetheless,
the
court
feels
that
the
state
must
comply
with
the
one-voice
doctrine
under
the
finding
affairs
powers
of
congress,
we
believe
that
the
record
is
more
than
adequate
to
demonstrate
that
we
are
speaking
with
one
voice
with
the
federal
government.
container
corp.
makes
that
clear,
container
corp.
which
this
court
decided
last
term,
makes
it
clear
that
the
inquiry
with
respect
to
one
voice
is
whether
or
not
the
challenged
action
has
merely
a
foreign
resonance
or
does
it
have
foreign
policy
implications.
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
solicitor
general
have
addressed
the
container
corp.
standard.
we
think
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
at
most
what
alaska
does
in
requiring
primary
manufacture
before
export
is
to
create
some
foreign
resonance,
a
resonance,
by
the
way,
which
is
totally
in
harmony
with
the
same
resonance
which
is
created
as
a
result
of
the
federal
primary
manufacture
requirement
on
timberlands
would
could
very
well
be
directly
adjacent
to
state
lands.
given
that
situation
that
the
federal
government
has
in
effect
created
the
processed
timber
market,
that
the
federal
government
supplies
timber
in
cant
form
in
the
foreign
commerce
market
every
day,
we
find
it
incredulous
to
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
would
suggest
that
the
state
of
alaska
is
not
speaking
with
the
same
voice
that
the
federal
government
is
speaking
in
this
regard.
finally,
your
honor,
we
wish
to
offer
that
if
the
court
determines
that
we
are
not
a
market
participant,
that
congress
has
not
consented
to
our
primary
manufacture
requirement,
that
nonetheless
under
the
facts
here
the
state's
primary
manufacture
requirement
satisfies
traditional
commerce
clause
analysis
under
the
pike
versus
bruce
church
case.
the
requirement
applies
evenhandedly,
it
applies
to
all
purchasers
regardless
of
their
origin,
be
they
californian
or
alaskan,
be
they
korean
or
japanese,
and
it
applies
to
interstate
as
well
as
foreign
commerce.
but
more
importantly,
it
effectuates
an
important
local
interest,
that
is
of
sustaining
the
existence
of
a
local
timber
industry
and
sustaining
the
underlying
economic
base
and
social
base
which
depends
so
heavily
upon
that
timber
industry
in
rural
alaska.
this
is
not
economic
protectionism,
as
it
is
so
pejoratively
referred
to
by
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioner.
thank
you.
