unknown
speaker
well,
that's
true,
isn't
it?
doesn't
alaska
own
the
timber
we're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
how
much
more
could
alaska
get
for
its
timber
sales
if
it
didn't
have
the
in-state
processing
requirement?
unknown
speaker
could
alaska
sell
its
timber
without
the
requirement
and
turn
around
and
use
the
extra
money
to
somehow
subsidize
in-state
processing?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
can't
they
do
it
this
way?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
time
will
tell.
unknown
speaker
mr.
deveaux,
what
percentage
of
the
timber
lands
in
alaska
are
state-owned
as
opposed
to
federal
or
privately
owned?
unknown
speaker
the
state
could
mill
it
itself,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
a
functioning
mill.
and
you
say
that
it
would
have
to
operate
it
itself;
it
couldn't
lease
it
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
lease
it
out.
but
then
could
it
require
that
all
the
logs
be
run
through
that
mill
before
they
enter
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
their
rental,
their
lease,
their
rental
under
the
lease,
let's
assume,
was
a
percentage
rental
of
everything
that
was
sold,
and
then
it
says
everything,
all
the
logs,
are
going
to
have
to
go
through
that
mill.
you
still
say
that
would
be
downstream
control?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
frequently
the
case
in
these
questions.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
fundamental
argument
is
that
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
that
you
actually
have
in
this
case
just
insulates
the
local
processor
from
any
kind
of
competition
anywhere
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suppose
the
state
could
say,
none
of
the
logs
that
we
own
and
sell
to
anybody
will
ever
be
used
outside
the
state
of
alaska?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
state-owned
logs.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
natural
resources?
what
about
the
cement
case,
the
south
dakota?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
the
state
made
the
cement,
though,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
timber
is
a
renewable
resource
and
i
would
hope
alaska's
in
the
business
of
replanting
and
growing
its
timber.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
that
that's
like
natural
gas,
which
you
can't
reproduce.
unknown
speaker
what
about
fish?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
were
to
resolve
this
case
on
the
market
participation
theory,
then
the
federal
government
takes
no
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
ms.
oberly,
why
can't
we
rely
on
counsel
to
do
that
combing
for
us?
i
assume
they'll
find
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
conceptually
is
there
anything
different
about
an
implicit
approval
theory
and
an
implied
cause
of
action
theory?
it's
the
same
sort
of
analysis,
isn't
it?
sometimes
congress
isn't
as
articulate
as
we
wish
they
would
be,
but
if
we
thought
they
really
intended
to
approve
this
sort
of
thing
we
still
shouldn't
agree
with
them?
unknown
speaker
clearly
and
expressly
don't
really
mean
the
same
thing,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
implicit
enough
or
clear
enough
you
call
it
express.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it's
express
if
congress
said
that
a
requirement
that
logs
owned
by
a
state
be
processed
before
they're
shipped
out
of
the
state
shall
not
be
considered
to
be
a
burden
on
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
an
approval
of
a
burden.
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
not.
it's
not
an
express
approval
of
a
burden.
it
just
says
it
isn't
a
burden.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
court
says
it's
a
burden?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
federal
government
impose
the
restraint,
the
very
restraint
you're
talking
about,
on
timber
exported
from
alaska?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
to
encourage
the
local
industry
or
to
see
to
it
that
the
federal
government
had
local
processing
for
its
own
needs?
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
it
now?
unknown
speaker
and
still
remains
silent.
unknown
speaker
knowingly
silent.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
kind
of...
that
consent
which
you
say
congress
gave
would
cover
an
alaska
statute
that
related
not
only
to
state-owned
timber,
but
to
privately
owned
timber?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
the
limit
of
the
consent?
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
alaska
attempted
to
require
that
privately
owned
timber
be
processed
before
it
was
exported,
you
think
that
would
be
a
burden
on
commerce
that
would
be
illegal?
unknown
speaker
when
does...
how
does
alaska
sell
its
timber,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
and
they
take
the
highest
bidder,
and
when
does
title
pass,
or
when
is
the
sale
complete,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
take
the
answer
to
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
when
is
payment
made?
unknown
speaker
but
the
buyer,
then,
who
then
has
the
timber,
who's
cut
the
timber
and
owns
the
timber,
then
can't
do
anything
with
them
unless
he
processes
them
first?
well,
if
he
wants
to
ship
them
out
of
the
state
he
has
to
have
them
processed
first.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
do
you
think
that
a
lot
of
this
timber
that
is
sold
by
the
state
from
its
own
forests
would
be
exported
without
processing
except
for
this
law?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
processing
are
you
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
and
are
those
in
turn
used
for
pulp,
making
pump?
unknown
speaker
and
how...
if
timber
would
be
exported
without
processing
except
for
this
law,
how
would
it
be
exported?
is
it
on
ships?
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
it
had
been
made
into
pulp?
unknown
speaker
so
that
to
the
extent
that
it's
made
into
pulp
it
would
probably
be
processed
in
alaska
anyway.
unknown
speaker
just
because
of
the
economics.
unknown
speaker
right,
right,
right.
and
that...
you
just
don't
save
that
much
money
on
freight
or
anything
else
by...
on
the
difference
between
logs
and
cants?
i
mean,
there's
no
economic
incentive
necessarily
to
process
the
logs
into
cants
in
alaska.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
would
anybody
ever
want
to
ship
logs?
it's
for
packing
purposes,
isn't
it?
they
can
get
more
in
a
given
space.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
all
you're
telling
me
is
that
even
without
this
law
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
process
the
logs
into
cants
in
alaska
than
to
ship
logs.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
just
wondering
how
much
difference
this
law
makes
at
all.
and
i'm
wondering
why
south-western
is
so
upset
by
it
if
it's
more
efficient
to
make
the
logs
into
cants
right
there
in
alaska.
unknown
speaker
alaska
could
get
a
lot
more
money,
though,
if
it
sold
them
without
that
requirement.
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
them
floated
down
on
the
inland
waterway
to
canadian
destinations?
unknown
speaker
you
could
float
them
down
to
canada,
couldn't
they,
with
tugs?
unknown
speaker
general,
may
i
ask
this
question:
what
market
is
alaska
participating
in?
unknown
speaker
you
say
alaska
is
a
market
participant.
what
is
it
marketing?
unknown
speaker
does
alaska
process
timber?
do
you
have
any
pulp
plants?
unknown
speaker
does
it
process
the
logs
after
they're
cut?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
no
participation
in
the
processing?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
an
interest
in
the
logs
when
they're
processed.
unknown
speaker
how
far
down
the
line
would
the
processing
go?
suppose
the
statute
were
enlarged
to
embrace
the
processing
into
furniture?
would
that
be
equally
valid
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
but
in
terms
of
theory,
there's
no
limit
to
your
argument
with
respect
to
market
participant,
is
there?
in
other
words,
a
statute
would
be
valid
if
it
said
no
timber
product,
in
whatever
form,
could
ever
be
exported;
it
would
have
to
be
manufactured
into
its
final
form
within
the
state?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
limit
was
just
debarking
under
water
pressure?
would
that
be
a
sufficient
processing,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
no.
we're
talking
about
other
than
local
requirements.
suppose
the
state
permitted
them
to
be
moved
just
with
debarking.
would
that
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
far
down
to
what
justice
powell
was
addressing,
to
the
making
of
chairs
and
tables?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
argument
is
any
different
than
an
argument...
maybe
you're
making
this
argument...
the
state
could
just
refuse
to
sell
any
logs
except
to
alaska
processors?
unknown
speaker
they
just
pick
and
choose
their
customers.
they
don't
have
any
contract
that
says
they
have
to
be
processed,
but
they
just
go
out
and
sell
their
logs
to
alaska
processors.
unknown
speaker
you
just
take
bids
from
people
who
are
alaska
processors.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
have
any
contract
at
all
that
requires
it
to
be
done,
but
you
just
sell
to
alaska
processors,
that's
all.
is
that
any...
you
certainly
would
say
they
could
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
talking
about
somebody
who
has
a
processing
establishment
in
the
state.
unknown
speaker
whether
he's
an
alaska
corporation
or
not.
unknown
speaker
general
lorensen,
may
i
just
ask
this
question
on
your
market
participant
theory.
is
it
not
true
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
purchaser,
after
he
acquired
whatever
he
was
getting
from
the
state
as
market
participant,
was
free
to
do
with
the
product
whatever
he
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases...
are
there
any
other
market
participant
cases
in
which
the
purchaser
is
not
free,
having
bought
it
from
the
state,
to
do
anything
he
wants?
in
other
words,
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
a
case
in
which
you
just
decided
to
sell
to
people
who
had
lumber
mills
or
whatever
you
call
the
facilities
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
white,
the
city
is
the
purchaser.
here
the
sovereign
is
the
seller.
unknown
speaker
and
after
the
city
acquires
the
building
or
whatever's
being
built,
that's
the
end
of
the
transaction.
unknown
speaker
nobody
can
comply
with
your
requirement
who
doesn't
have
a
processing
plant
there,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
are
doing
more
than
just
refusing
to
sell
to
anybody
except
with
a
processing
plant.
you
are
saying,
even
if
we
sell
to
somebody
without
a
processing
plant,
he
has
to
get
it
processed
in
alaska.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
doing
more
than
just
choosing
people.
you're
choosing...
you're
doing
more
than
just
choosing
customers
who
have
processing
plants.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
doing
much
more.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
legality
of
alaska
just
choosing
to
sell
its
timber
only
to
processing
plants
that
are
located
in
alaska?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
something
more.
if
they
just
sold
to...
if
they
just
absolutely
refuse
to
sell
any
timber
except
to
a
processing
plant
customer,
couldn't
the
state
do
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
they're
doing.
they're
doing
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
they're
saying,
even
if
we
accept
a
bid...
whoever
we
accept
a
bid
from,
we
require
them
to
get
the
processing
done
in
alaska.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
state
took
that
risk,
but
nevertheless
just
chose
to
sell
to
people
who
have
processing
plants
in
alaska,
you
wouldn't
find
much
of
a
problem
with
that,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
same
distinction
we
make
in
the
vertical
price-fixing
cases
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
colgate
case
on
the
one
hand
and
dr.
miles
on
the
other,
isn't
it?
one
time
you
tie
them
up
contractually
to
resell
at
a
fixed
price,
another
one
you
just
say
i
won't
sell
to
you
next
time.
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
a
distinction
that's--
