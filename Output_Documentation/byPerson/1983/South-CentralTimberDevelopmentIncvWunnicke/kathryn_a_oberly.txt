ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
federal
interest
in
this
case
is
in
the
implicit
approval
theory
that
the
court
of
appeals
invented
out
of
whole
cloth
as
far
as
we're
concerned
to
validate
alaska's
otherwise
clearly
impermissible
burden
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
we
briefed
all
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
including
the
market
participant
doctrine,
and
support
south-central's
position
on
that
issue.
but
since
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
decide
that
issue,
our
primary
interest
is
in
the
validity
of
the
implicit
approval
doctrine.
but
we
are
in
agreement
with
south-central
on
this
case
not
falling
within
the
market
participant
doctrine.
on
the
implicit
approval
theory,
we
think
that
the
reasons
for
requiring
a
rule
of
express
congressional
consent
are
fairly
obvious
and
they're
well
demonstrated
by
this
case.
without
such
a
rule,
the
courts
are
left
to
guess
from
a
welter
of
federal
enactments
what
congress
had
in
mind
on
a
subject
that
it
hasn't
spoken
about.
here
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
federal
policy
relating
to
federal
timber
on
national
forest
lands,
recognizing,
as
the
state
itself
recognizes,
that
there
is
no
congressional
policy
for
state
timber
on
state-owned
lands.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
the
federal
policy
for
federal
logs
and
concluded
it
was
sufficiently
similar
to
the
state
policy
that
that
was
implicitly
a
validation
of
the
state
policies.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do
and
what
its
implicit
approval
theory
would
necessarily
require
is
that
a
court
comb
through
the
entire
u.s.
code
and
probably
all
u.s.
treaties
as
well
to
find
out
whether
there
are
other
federal
policies
that
are
or
are
not
consistent
with
the
state
policy
that
a
state
is
attempting
to
uphold
in
the
absence
of
express
congressional
consent.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no
one
found
it
in
this
case,
your
honor,
for
one
thing.
and
more
importantly,
i
don't
think
that
it's
the
court's
role,
when
it's
congress'
job
to
speak
to
national
commerce.
i
mean,
there's
basically
nothing
more
important
on
congress'
agenda.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there
are
many
cases
where
the
court
has
to
figure
out
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
hasn't
spoken
as
clearly
as
it
might
have.
but
in
the
area
of
sanctioning
what
would
otherwise
be
clear
burdens
on
interstate
commerce,
this
court
has
consistently
required
congress
to
speak
clearly
and
to
speak
expressly,
and
it's
done
so
for
a
number
of
reasons.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
meant
them
to
mean
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
it's
required
express
language
from
congress
twice--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--twice
last
term,
your
honor,
the
court
actually
required
express
congressional
consent.
that
was
not
the
first
time.
this
doctrine
goes
back
at
least
as
far
as
this
court's
decision
in
h.p.
hood
&
sons
versus
dumond,
in
which
the
same...
similar
implicit
approval
theory
was
advanced
and
the
court
rejected
it,
saying
the
fact
that
the
state
policy
may
be
harmonious
with
federal
policy
is
not
sufficient.
if
congress
wants
to
authorize
a
state
burden
on
commerce,
it
has
the
power
to
do
so
by
passing
legislation,
and
that's
the
way
it
has
to
act.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
would
clearly
be
express.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it's
express
sanction
for
the
state
to
do--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
but
without
that
congressional
enactment--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--when
congress
has
spoken,
it's
congress'
judgment
as
to
whether
it
wishes
to
permit
that
burden
under
the
commerce
clause.
here
the
problem
is
that
congress
has
not
spoken
about
alaska's
policy.
it's
only
spoken
about
federal
policy,
and
we're
left
to
infer
from
what,
what
would
congress
think
about
this
state
policy.
the
principal
problem
that
we
have
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
that
it's
ignored
significant
other
federal
policies
that
congress
has
passed
and
talked
about
in
statutes,
particularly
the
export
control
laws.
it's
quite
clear
that
alaska's
primary
manufacture
requirement
is
a
violation
of
congress'
express
statutory
policy
against
imposing
export
restraints
on
u.s.
products.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
federal
policy
began
in
1928,
when
the
united
states
ran
alaska
as
a
territory,
and
essentially
its
origins
are
for
the
same
reasons
that
alaska
now
wants
to
have
the
same
requirement.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
in
1928
it
was
both,
because
in
our
capacity...
in
the
united
states'
capacity
as
running
alaska
as
a
territory,
it
had
a
legitimate
concern
in
encouraging
local
employment,
as
well
as
providing
sufficient
timber
processing
capacity
for
federal
timber.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
today
the
policy
applies
to
all
of
the
states
west
of
the
hundredth
meridian,
including
alaska,
although
in
alaska
it's
by
regulation
and
in
the
other
lower
48
states
it's
by
statute.
and
today
the
policy
is
basically
to
ensure
jobs
for
americans,
but
it's
on
a
national
collective
basis
that
congress
has
made
that
decision,
rather
than
on
a
single
state
protectionist
basis.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
invalidated
single
state
protectionist
legislation
when
a
state
has
attempted
to
do
it.
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
would
approve
of
the
same
thing,
the
same
action
by
a
state.
when
congress
makes
that
judgment,
it's
taking
the
entire
national
welfare
into
account,
as
is
properly
its
function
under
the
commerce
clause.
when
a
state
makes
that
judgment,
it's
only
considering
its
own
parochial
interests,
and
congress
may
or
may
not
find
those
compatible
with
the
national
welfare.
that's
why
we
think
it
is
quite
important
that
there
be
express
congressional
sanction
for
something
that
would
otherwise
clearly
be
a
burden.
there
may
be
some
inconsistency
here,
in
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
something
that
on
its
face
appears
harmonious
with
what
alaska's
doing.
but
at
least
it's
a
decision
at
the
federal
level
by
the
representatives
of
the
entire
nation
that
that's
the
policy
they
want.
in
alaska's
case
of
alaska's
regulation,
it's
a
decision
by
one
state
to
oust
from
competition
residents
or
corporations
attempting
to
compete
within
alaska
who
are
not
represented
in
alaska,
and
it
has
its
principal
effect
here,
which
makes
it
even
more
serious
in
our
view,
on
foreign
commerce
since
90
percent
of
alaska's
timber
is
exported
to
japan.
the
subject
of
log
export
restraints
is
a
constant
subject
of
negotiation
between
the
united
states
and
japan,
between
the
u.s.
trade
representative
and
japan,
and
something
those
two
countries
discuss
on
a
government
to
government
level.
it's
not
something
that
the
united
states
trade
representative's
negotiations
are
helped
by
having
states
add.
even
if
their
voices
are
harmonious,
they're
still
a
second
voice
rather
than
the
federal
government
speaking
with
one
voice,
as
this
court
has
clearly
said
must
be
the
case
in
matters
affecting
foreign
affairs.
so
that
if
congress
chooses,
knowing
all
the
things
it's
weighing
in
the
balance,
to
have
both
a
policy
of
in-state
processing
for
federal
timber
and
to
be
against
export
restraints,
it
does
so
with
full
awareness
of
the
needs
of
the
entire
country.
when
alaska
makes
that
decision,
it's
just
simply
not
the
part
of
our
federal
union
that
the
constitution
has
entrusted
that
decisionmaking
process
to.
i
might
also
add
that
two
important
points
in
our
view
are
that,
in
response
to
the
district
court
decision
in
this
very
case,
congress
has
been
asked
by
the
western
states
to
pass
legislation
that
would
specifically
authorize
exactly
what
alaska
now
does.
it
has
not
passed
that
legislation.
to
take
from...
this
is
not
simply
a
case
of
congressional
silence.
it's
a
case
where
congress
is
fully
aware
of
the
issue
and
yet
it
hasn't
acted.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
and
still
remains
silent.
under
those
circumstances,
it
we
think
exceeds
the
judicial
function
for
the
courts--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it's
knowingly
silent,
that's
correct.
--for
the
courts
to
assume
that
even
though
congress
knows
about
the
issue
but
hasn't
spoken,
congress
would
be
pleased
or
at
least
not
dissatisfied
with
what
alaska
has
decided
to
do.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
