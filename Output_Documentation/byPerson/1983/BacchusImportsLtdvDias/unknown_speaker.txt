unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
would
your
client
have
had
any
complaint
if
the
exceptions
for
the
hawaiian
drink
and
the
pineapple
wine
were
not
included
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
no.
simply
if...
if
the
statute
had
just
been
across
the
board.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
paradise
and
mckesson
did
not
appeal
or
did
not
come
here,
as
they,
except
as
respondents?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
reason
for
not
joining
you
and
your
client?
unknown
speaker
get
a
free
ride,
hmm?
unknown
speaker
saves
money.
it
saves
money.
unknown
speaker
unless
your
fee
award
is
allocated.
unknown
speaker
but
they
have
filed
a
brief
and
hired
attorneys.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
they've
saved
are
the
filing
fees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
before
you
get
into
the
three
points
of
the
hawaiian
supreme
court's
reasoning,
those
footnotes
that
point
out
that
the
two
products
that
are
exempted
are
apparently
not
widely
produced
throughout
the
world,
o
what
extent
do
you
contend
that
all
alcoholic
beverages
are
fungible?
unknown
speaker
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if...
on
behalf
of
a
wholesaler
who
stocked
some
of
the
exempted
products?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
even
if
you
carried
these
products,
that
you'd
still
have
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
interrupt
you.
what
relief
are
you
seeking
here?
unknown
speaker
if
you
get
the
refund,
what
happens
to
it?
this
tax
has
been
passed
on,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
content
with
just
the
declaratory
judgment
in
prospective
relief?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it's
their...
it's
their
windfall
rather
than
yours,
to
use
the
expressions
thrown
around
in
the
preceding
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
if
your
complaint
here
were
an
equal
protection
claim
rather
than
a
commerce
clause
claim
and
the
court
were
to
agree
with
your
equal
protection
analysis,
that
your
client
was
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law
because
of
these
exemptions
in
the
law,
typically
a
mandate
from
this
court
and
an
opinion
of
this
court
upholding
your
contention
would
say,
in
effect,
to
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
you
either
don't
tax
mr.
easterbrook's
clients
or
you
tax
the
hawaiian
drink
and
the
pineapple
wine
people.
why
wouldn't
the
same
sort
of
an
opinion
and
mandate
be
appropriate
in
a
commerce
clause
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
don't
think
the
equal...
the
equal
protection
analysis,
as
i
understand
it,
doesn't
depend
on
any
claim
that
refunds
are
inappropriate.
the
equal
protection
approach
depends
on
saying
that
the
exemptions
are
no
good,
so
you
either
don't
tax
anybody
or
you
tax
everybody.
you
can't
tax
them
with
the
exemptions.
and
so
the
state
can
go
back
and
say
okay,
we'll
tax
nobody
over
that
period,
or
we'll
tax
everybody
over
that
period.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
might
be
able
to,
for
the
future,
as
you
say,
to
either
tax
everybody
or
not,
but
it
is...
this
is
a
past
transaction.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
you're
out
of
pocket.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook--
--well,
mr.--
--oh,
excuse
me.
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
to
tell
me
what
case
you
think
provides
the
strongest
support
you
can
find
for
your
position,
if
you
had
to
name
one
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
these...
closest
to
these
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
easterbrook,
i
suppose
that
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
you
that
this
particular
scheme
violates
the
commerce
clause
and
therefore
reverse,
that
on
remand
it
would
be
open
at
least
for
hawaii
to
make
its
argument
as
to
what
defenses
it
might
have
on
the
remedy,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
possibly
even
for
the
past
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
be
cheaper
for
the
state
to
go
back
and
produce
tax
revenues
to
pay
it
for
the
wine
than
to
pay
your
clients
the
ten
point
some
million
dollars
that
you're
claiming.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
a
moment
ago
you
said
that
mere
prospective
application
couldn't
remedy
the
harm
that
your
clients
had
suffered.
are
you
speaking
now
of
actual
proven
harm?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
i've
taken
economics
1,
too,
but
i
was
wondering
if
is
there
something
more
in
the
record
indicating
that
your
client's
products
were
handicapped
because
the
hawaiian
beverage
the
pineapple
wine
were
not
taxed?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
statute
of
limitations
on
collecting
tax
on
past
transactions?
unknown
speaker
pursuing
justice
rehnquist's
thought
that
the
stipulation
indicates
the
harm
caused
by
the
tax,
but
it
doesn't
indicate
that
the
harm
is
any
different
than
it
would
be
if
these
exotic
products
had
also
been
taxed.
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
court
below
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
does
this
argument
mean
that
hawaii
could...
could
not
prohibit
the
sale
of
all
beverages,
all
alcoholic
beverages
except
these
two
products?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
need
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
need
the
exemption?
what
was
the
motive
for
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
wasn't...
the
exemptions
didn't
permit
the
company
to
sell
its
wine
at
a
lower
price?
unknown
speaker
so
they
were...
they...
they
were
competing
for
the
tourist
trade.
unknown
speaker
in
spite
of
their--
unknown
speaker
--in
spite
of
their
indigenous
quality,
the
hawaiians
don't
like
them.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
competing
for
the
tourist
trade.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they're...
you
mean
they're
trying
to
develop
some
new
customers
who
never
drink
anything
in
their
life?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
you
cited,
i
think,
a
texas
case
where
they
gave
an
exemption
on
beer
and...
beer
and
wine,
and
that
did
not
invalidate
the
basic
tax
statute.
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
me
the
cite...
the
name
of
that
case
again?
i
didn't
remember
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yeah.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
21st
amendment
has
that
thrust,
why
shouldn't
it
prevent
prospective
relief?
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
it
prevent
prospective
relief
as
well
as
retrospective?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
why...
why...
why...
and
you're
saying
the
21st
amendment
should
protect
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
how
much
money's
involved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dexter,
has
that
been
a
requirement
of
our
past
tax
decisions,
that
a
party
not
only
have
paid
the
tax
in
question,
but
that
he
have,
as
you
put
it,
borne
the
economic
burden
of
it?
unknown
speaker
do
any
cases
that
you
know
of
from
this
court
support
the
propositions
which
you're
stating?
unknown
speaker
which
deny
refunds
because
the
person
apply
for
them
has
already
passed
the
tax
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
some
laws
require
the
guy
who
pays
it
to
pass
it
on.
unknown
speaker
but
nobody...
nobody
required
a
pass-on
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
are
these
cases
required
pass-ons
or--
unknown
speaker
--optional
pass-ons?
unknown
speaker
but
those
cases
didn't
deny
prospective
relief.
unknown
speaker
those
cases
did
not
deny
prospective
relief.
unknown
speaker
but
alexandria
scrap
and
reeves
and
cases
like
that
did
think
they
were
speaking
about
the
market
participation
rather
than
regulation.
here
you
have
something
that
is
by
its
terms
a
tax.
don't
you
think
we
would
really
create
chaos
if
we
expanded
the
market
participant
notion
to
things
that
were
just
frankly
admitted
to
be
taxes?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
i
would
agree
with
you
on
that.
does...
don't
importers
bring,
say,
strawberry
wine
or
other
kinds
of
fruit
wine
into
hawaii?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
grapes
are
fruit.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
still
trying
to
get
people...
some
people
who
are
drinking
x
and
y
to
drink
these
products
instead.
unknown
speaker
you
are
competing
with
something.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
competing
with?
unknown
speaker
nothing?
unknown
speaker
beer.
unknown
speaker
wine.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
competing
with
something,
some
product--
unknown
speaker
--or
you
wouldn't
have...
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--or
you're
just
developing
a
whole
new
class
of
drinkers.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
stuff
is
like
brandy,
you
can't
call
it
a
soft
drink.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
answer
that?
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
the
market
for
this
okolehao?
they
must
sell
it
to
somebody?
non-redskins
fans.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say...
you...
you
say
it's
a
traditional
drink,
and
yet
you
say
the
hawaiians
don't
like
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i've
been
over
to
hawaii
several
times.
i've
never
seen
or
heard
of
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
i've
never
seen
anybody
that
has
seen
or
heard
of
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
until
today.
unknown
speaker
mr....
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
the
statute
defined
alcoholic
beverages
in
a
way
that
simply
excluded
these
products,
would
you
have
the
same
argument,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
if
the
tax
were
on
all
bottled
beverages,
all
beverages
sold
in
a
glass
bottle
or
something
like
that,
and
then
they
had
an
exemption
for
these
two,
then
everybody
who
sold
coca-cola
and
everything
else
would
get
the
refund,
too.
unknown
speaker
and
they
drink
them,
and
they
are
drunk
because
they
are
alcoholic.
unknown
speaker
not
regularly.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
