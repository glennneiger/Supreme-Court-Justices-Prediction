mr.
william
d.
dexter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
appellants
argue
that
because
for
a
five-year
period
hawaii
exempted
okolehao
and
pineapple
wine,
which
are
made
only
in
hawaii,
and
which
amounted
to
less
than
one
percent
of
the
total
sales
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
hawaii,
because
of
these
circumstances
they
are
entitled
to
a
refund
of
all
the
taxes
hawaii
imposed
on
all
alcoholic
beverages,
amounting
to
approximately
10
percent
of
the
annual
budget
of
hawaii.
now,
as
indicated
by
their
argument,
appellants
can
only
get
to
this
point
by
arguing
that
all
alcoholic
beverages
compete
with
one
another,
and
that
the
exemption,
therefore,
creates
some
kind
of
a
per
se
discrimination.
this
is
contrary
to
a
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
starting
with
tiernan
v.
rinker.
in
tiernan
this
court
held
that
the
exemption
of
beer
and
wine
produced
in
texas
did
not
invalidate
a
general
liquor
tax
imposed
on
all
sales
of
all
liquor
products.
it
recognized
there
that
the
exemption
of
beer
and
wine
produced
in
texas
could
only
be
discriminatory
as
to
imported
beer
and
wine.
so
contrary
to
appellants'
universal
argument,
we
believe
that
this
case
should
be
examined
in
light
of
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
here
before
the
court.
we
are
here
dealing
with
two
unique
hawaiian
products.
okolehao
is
a
traditional
hawaiian
beverage
distilled
from
the
ti
plant.
originally
it
was
drunk
as
a
fermented
mash.
in
1970
explorers
taught
the
natives
how
to
distill
the
mash.
in
fact,
the
term
okolehao
is
the
hawaiian
term
for
the
iron
caldron
and
the
gun
barrel
used
for
this
purpose.
so
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
unique,
indigenous
hawaiian
product,
and
it
was
so
found
by
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii.
also,
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
the
appellants
here
do
not
represent
the
manufacture
of
any
out-state
products.
they
are
solely
in-state
wholesalers,
and
so
they
have
to
limit
any
claim
of
discrimination
based
on
product
discrimination
and
not
because
of
their
particular
circumstance.
they
as
wholesalers
have
in
no
way
been
damaged
here.
now,
as
found
by
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii,
also
no
okolehao
or
pineapple
wine
is
produced
anywhere
else
in
the
world.
and
the
hawaii
supreme
court,
because
of
this
fact
and
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
these
products,
specifically
found
that
these
exemptions
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
and
that
is
why
the
hawaiian
supreme
court
really
analyzed
the
issue
as
one
involving
equal
protection
and
not
commerce
clause
considerations
per
se,
including
that
of
the
21st
amendment.
and
also,
it's
important
to
note
there's
no
allegation
or
proof
in
the
record
in
these...
this
case
that
the
exemptions
adversely
affected
appellants'
business
of
importing
beer
and
wine
or
had
any
effect
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
before
you
get
to
any
product
discrimination
case,
you
have
to
find
that
okolehao
and
a
peculiar,
distinct
wine
produced
in
hawaii,
pineapple
wine,
is
competitive
with
the
importation
of
beer
and
wine.
now,
when
the
exemptions
were
enacted--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
motive
for
the
exemptions,
your
honor,
were
to...
as
far
as
okolehao
was
concerned,
it
was
in
financial
difficulty.
this
is
a
traditional
cultural
drink
product
of
hawaii,
a
tourist
attraction.
the
hawaiian
legislature
was
trying
to
get
that
fledgling
industry
off
of
its
feet.
when
they
granted
the
pineapple
wine
or
the
fruit
wine
exemption,
there
was
absolutely
no
production
in
hawaii,
and
apparently
one
person
wanted
to
try
to
produce
some
kind
of
wine
in
one
of
the
hawaiian
islands.
and
so
the
exemptions
were
simply
to
try
to
promote
either
a
traditional
local
industry,
the
production
of
okolehao,
or
the
production
of
pineapple
wine
that
was
not
in
existence
in
1976.
in
fact,
in
1976,
the
first
year
of
the
wine
exemption,
there
was
no
sales
of
wine
at
all
in
hawaii.
in
1977
the
sales
were--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--well,
the
exemptions,
in
our
judgment,
operated
in
the
nature
of
a
subsidy;
that
what
the
hawaiian
legislature
was
trying
to
do
was
to
try
to
help
these...
this
okolehao
manufacturer
and
somebody
that
wanted
to
get
into
the
pineapple
wine
business
or
other
wine
business
to
get
started.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
basically
they're
tourist
items,
and
they're
not
items
that
are
generally
competitive
in
the--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--liquor
market
or...
in
hawaii.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
your
honor,
they--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--well,
one
of
the
difficulties,
for
example,
indicating
the
nature
of
okolehao,
one
of
the
parties,
mckensson...
these
are
liquor
people
who
ought
to
know
what
they're
talking...
says
it's
something
like
a
whiskey.
now,
i
think
bacchus
says
well,
it's
something
like
a
brandy.
and
the
fact
of
it
is
it's
a
peculiar
product
made
by
this
traditional
ti
root
in
hawaii,
and
i
don't
think
it's
comparable
to
anything
else,
and
i
don't
think
a
good
brandy
drinker
would
think
this
an
appropriate
substitute.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
primarily
it
was
a...
it's
a
novelty
item.
it
comes
in
a
fancy...
the
okolehao
comes
in
a
fancy
bottle
and
sometimes
with
some
lava
rock
around
the
outside.
it's...
it's...
it's
a
tourist
item,
and
this
is
what
they
were
trying
to
promote.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
that's
tiernan
versus
rinker.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
102
u.s.
123--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--1880.
and
we'll
have
a
little
bit
more
to
say
about
that
case
later,
hopefully.
okay.
against
this...
this
factual
background...
well,
i
might
turn
to
one
other
fact.
i
suggested
no
pineapple
wine
in
production
in
1976,
very
little
in
1977.
now,
in
1976
when
the
exemption
was
enacted
for
pineapple
wine
in
okolehao,
this
product,
okolehao,
amounted
to
two-tenths
of
one
percent
of
the
total
liquor
sales
in
hawaii.
it
amounted
to
only
3.7
percent
of
the
total
liquor
produced
in
hawaii
and
sold
in
hawaii.
it
was
a
very
minor
exemption,
and
the
exemptions,
as
i
indicated,
were
for
a
very
limited
period
of
time
for
this
express
purpose
of
trying
to
create
a
market.
now,
against
this
factual
background
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
consider
the
following
points.
first,
the
exemptions
in
question
in
our
judgment
are
not
distinguishable
from
direct
subsidies
to
preserve
hawaii's
cultural
heritage,
the
production
of
okolehao,
and
to
promote
a
new
industry
such
as
pineapple
wine.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
complete
absence
of
any
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case.
and
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
if
there
is
no
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
these
appellants
or
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
there
cannot
be
any
discrimination
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
i
think
this
is
rather
fundamental
by
examination
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
make,
that
any
decision
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
appellant
should
be
given
only
prospective
application,
because
contrary
to
the
argument
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
the
21st
amendment
rules
would
be
changed
substantially
if
these
small,
innocuous
exemptions
in
the
hawaiian
liquor
law
were
construed
by
this
court
to
invalidate
the
entire
hawaiian
liquor
law
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
why...
the...
why
should
it?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
we're
asking
only
for...
for...
to
limit
the
case
to
prospective
relief,
maybe
i
misstated
myself.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no.
what
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
that
if
this
court
on
the
merits
would
decide
that
this
indeed
amounts
to
unconstitutional
discrimination,
we're
saying
that
this
changes
the...
the
thrust
of
the
prior
21st
amendment
decisions
of
this
court
significantly
enough--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--to
require
the
court
to
make
a...
make
that
rule
prospective
rather
than
retroactive.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
there
is...
there's
around
$100...
between
$100
and
$120.
the
appellants
in
this
case,
as
well
as
the
other
wholesalers,
pass
the
tax
on,
they
collect
it
from
their
dealers,
and
it's
put
into
some
kind
of
a
fund
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
suit.
but
it's
about
10
percent
of
the
total
hawaii
budget.
and
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
regardless
of
these
other
issues,
the
appellants
are
not
entitled
to
any
refunds
because
they
have
not
borne
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax,
and
therefore,
they
would
be
unjustly
enriched
by
any
refund.
the
stipulation
of
facts,
for
instance,
indicates
that
these
taxes
are
added
on
to
the
normal
selling
price
or
the
marked
up
selling
price
of
these
appellants,
and
those
taxes
are
passed
on
directly
as
part
of
that
pricing
to
their
retail
customers.
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
issue
about
that.
it's
clearly
in
the
stipulation
of
fact,
and
i
think
the
stipulated
fact
provisions
are
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
multi-state
tax
commission.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
your
honor,
that
has
been...
that
has
been
a...
certainly
the
general
pattern
of
the...
most
of
the
tax
decisions,
state
and
federal,
in
the
united
states.
i
would
refer
you
to
two
cases
in
this
category
that
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief
that
are
federal
cases:
travel
industries
of
kansas,
inc.
v.
united
states,
425
federal
second
1297,
tenth
circuit
1970;
mcgowan
v.
united
states,
297
federal
second
252,
fifth
circuit
1961.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
don't
know
as
that
any...
but
these...
there's
a
multitude
of
federal
cases
under
federal
excise
taxes,
but
i
don't...
i
haven't
found
any
that
have
gotten
to
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right,
right.
in
these...
and
in
these
cases
the
court
said...
the
courts...
one
was
the
fifth
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit...
they
said
even
though
there
wasn't
any
limit
on
the
refund
statutes
that
as
a
general
common
law
principle...
and
it's
been
on
our
judicial
system
for
a
number
of
years...
a
person
who
does
not
bear
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax...
i
mean
where
you're
talking
about
a
direct
pass-on
tax
now.
i'm
not
talking
about--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
this--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--no.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
those
are
optional
pass-ons.
in
fact,
a
series
of
cases...
i
think
the
mcgowan
case
was
a...
one
of
the
more
recent
of
a
series
of
cases--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
no.
simply
they
said
okay,
if
you've
borne
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax,
you
can
get
it
back.
but
the
mcgowan
case
involved
a
series
of
problems
that
came
up
with
the
federal
transportation
excise
tax.
so
the
question
is
whether
you
added
this
tax
to
your
price
and
passed
it
on
to
the
persons
getting
the
transportation.
if
you
did,
you
didn't
get
it
back.
the...
turning
back
to
the
first
point,
that
the
exemptions
in
question
are
much
more
in
the
nature
of
direct...
of
subsidiaries
to
promote
two
hawaiian
products
rather
than
a
form
of
market
regulation,
i
would
like
to
indicate
the
following.
it's
the
substance
of
financial
aid
rather
than
it's
form
that
controls
for
constitutional
purposes
in
regard
to
the
subsidy
issue.
i
believe
this
was
pointed
out
by
justice
stevens
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
alexander
scrap.
in
fact,
the
form
of
subsidy
here
is
above
board.
its
impact
on
commerce
can
readily
be
evaluated
and
judged
by
this
court.
this
is
not
only
true...
this
is
not
true
with
other
forms
of
subsidies
such
as
industrial
development
bonds
or
even
some
indirect
subsidy.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place
we're
not
saying
that
this
is...
necessarily
should
be
treated
by
this
court
as
a
subsidy
per
se.
we're
saying
that
the
nature
of
the
exemption
here
and
its
effect
on
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
appellants'
business
is
identical
as
if
hawaii
had
included
the
okolehao
and
pineapple
wine
sales
as
taxable
sales
and
granted
these
parties
a
dollar
amount
subsidy
in
the
exact
amount
of
a
tax.
the
effect
on
commerce
would
have
been
identical.
and
certainly
i
think
there
is...
is...
is
a
problem,
as
you
suggest,
in
that
area.
we're
saying
the
intent
and
purpose
here,
the
operative
effect
of
what
was
done
is
analogous
to
a
subsidy,
because...
and
appellants
in
this
case
admit
that
if
these
were...
these
were
direct
payments,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
we're
simply
saying
here
that...
that...
that
form
and
substance
should
control
in
this
area.
and
i
think
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
this,
whether
it
is
a...
intended
to
discriminate
or
burden
commerce
rather
than
as
a
subsidy
that
we
have
to
realize
again
that
the
exemptions
were
enacted
to
preserve
hawaii's
cultural
heritage
and
to
promote
a
new
industry.
they
were
not
enacted
as
trade
barriers.
they
did
not
operate
as
trade
barriers.
and
the
fact
that
in
1976
when
the
exemptions
were
enacted
96.7
percent
of
locally-produced
hawaiian
liquor
products
was
taxed
indicates
the
limited
and
peculiar
nature
of...
of
these
exemptions.
we
believe
that
these
facts
establish
that
the
exemptions
were
in
the
nature
of
subsidies
as
intended
by
the
hawaiian
legislature.
and
we
also
believe
that
they
were
intended
to
promote
a
business
or
a
market
and
not
intended
in
any
way
to
regulate.
now,
turning
to
point
two,
i
would
just
simply
like
to
emphasize
again
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
establish
that
the
exempt
products
here
were
competitive
with
beer
and
wine
of
the
appellant
or
impeded
any
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
this
is
a
basic
factual
issue
the
appellants
have
not
tried
to
prove
in
any
way
or
tried
to
meet.
now,
since
the
exempted
products
were
not
produced
anywhere
else,
there
can
be
no
discrimination.
that
is
a
matter
of
fact.
as
here
indicated,
appellants
assume,
as
they
must,
that
all
alcoholic
beverages
compete
with
each
other
in
commerce;
therefore,
the
exemption
of
a
single
type
of
liquor
discriminates
against
all
other
liquor.
however,
the
court
should
exercise,
in
our
judgment,
great
care
in
determining
what
constitutes
product
discrimination
or
state
constitutional
purposes,
particularly
liquor
products
which
are
covered
by
the
21st
amendment--
now,
as
i've
indicated,
this
court
in
the
tiernan
case
has
already
indicated
that
the
exemption
of
beer
and
wine
by...
locally-produced
beer
and
wine
by
texas
did
not
invalidate
a
texas
liquor
law
except
to
the
extent
of
competing
beer
and
wine
coming
in
from
out
of
state.
the
texas
law
in
terms
of
its
imposition
is
not
distinguishable
from
that
of
hawaii.
it
just--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--well,
there
may...
the...
i
don't
know.
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
clear.
i
do
know
that
when
you
look
at
a
lot
of
the
liquor
laws
that
they
have
indicated,
put
in...
in
the
appendix
here
of
the
liquor
industry
that's
filed
in
this
case,
the
classification
of
wines
are
very
different.
there
could
be
grape
wines,
fruit
wines,
specialty
wines.
i
think--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--and...
right.
but
here
we
had
only
pineapple
wine.
but
we're
suggesting
if
there...
if
there
was
any...
any
product
competition
here,
it's
not
proven,
and
we
don't
know
what
it
is.
but
what
they're
saying
is
that
this...
that...
that,
for
instance,
the
exemption
of
okolehao,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
beer
and
wine,
knocks
out
the
whole
liquor
law,
and
wine
could
have
nothing
to
do
at
all
in
competition
with
beer
again
knocks
out
the
whole
liquor
law.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
but--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--yeah.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
i
submit--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--okolehao...
we
may
be
in
one
sense
competing
with--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--no.
possibly--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--brandy.
they
say
brandy
and
whiskey.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--and
then
this
gets
to
a
very
interesting--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--well,
but...
but...
but
it...
it
comes
to
the
point,
though,
how
much,
for
instance,
does
the
fact
that
liquor
is
subject
to
a
20
percent
tax
in
hawaii
and
soft
drinks
aren't,
how
much
is
this
liquor
then
discriminating
against
soft
drinks.
your...
your
problem
is
the
area
of
product
classification
here,
and
we
believe--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--no.
i
mean
they're
all
alcoholic
beverages.
we're
saying...
but
i'm
simply
saying
that...
that
each
product
ostensibly
competes
with
every
other
product
in
the
marketplace.
so
what...
what...
the
problem
is
how
do
you
classify
the
products,
what
do
you
classify
the
kind
of
competition.
we
think
that
the
classification
that
this
court
has
used
in
equal
protection
and
due
process
areas
is
equally
applicable
here.
we
also
believe
that
the...
the
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
defining
the
market
and
market
product
in
the
antitrust
cases
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
are
equally
applicable
here.
but
on
the
record,
we
don't
know
what's
competing
with
what,
except
we
know
that
there's
no
alcohol,
there's
no
pineapple
wine,
and
there's
no
okolehao
imported
into
hawaii,
and
we
know
there's
absolutely
no
proof
offered
or
suggested
or
relied
upon
by
the
appellants
as
to
product
competition.
they
simply
see
the
class
to
be
compared
is
all
liquor,
and
we
know
that
is
much,
much
too
broad
and
unreasonable.
to
illustrate
this,
can
you
really
imagine
a
redskin
fan
sitting
down
in
front
of
the
tv
viewing
the
tv,
too,
and
really
debating
whether
to
go
get
another
beer
from
the
six-pack
or
to
take
a
drink
of
okolehao
from
the--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--i
would...
they're...
they're...
in
my
judgment
they're
completely
uncomparable.
in
fact,
you'd
have
a
hard
time
finding
them
in
most
places.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
it's
primarily--
[laughter]
no.
it's...
it's...
it's
primarily
a
traditional
drink.
it
was
a
drink--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--well,
all
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor,
is
that
i
have
tasted
it.
we
tried
to
buy
it
generally
just
as
part
of
the
preparation
of
this
case
in
an
ordinary
restaurant,
at
bars,
and
it's
not
available.
we
did
find
it
in
a
tourist
attraction
place.
now,
that's
as
far
as
i
can
go
with...
but
obviously,
you
know,
it
is
a
liquor,
and
we're
not
denying
that.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
okay.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
and
the
record
indicates
in
this--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--yeah.
but
the
record
indicates
in
this
case
that
in
our
appendix
that
it's
declined
275
percent
from
the
time
the
exemption's
gone,
so
it
may
be
on
the
way
out.
[laughter]
so
i...
i...
but
our
position
is...
these
are
unique
products,
and
there's
no
competition
shown.
now,
as
to
the
third
reason...
that
is,
the
problem
of
damages,
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
here...
there
is
obviously
a
potential
for
this
court
saying
that
these
two
unique,
peculiar
products,
even
though
they
are
of
limited
value
and
significance,
and
even
though
there's
no
proof
of
it,
somehow
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
even
though
there
is
these
21st
amendment
restraints.
but
in
no
event
are
these
appellants
entitled
to
the
money
that
they're
asking
for.
this
money
was
passed
on.
this
money
has
been
absorbed
by
the
general
public
of
hawaii,
and
when
the
refunds
are
denied
them,
it
simply
means
that
the
money
goes
back
to
be
used
for
the
general
public
of
hawaii
rather
than
particular
appellants
that
are
trying
to
get
significant
and
substantial
windfalls.
this
is
the
law
in
this
country.
it's
a
general
equitable
principle
in
regard
to
unjust
enrichment.
and
i
know
of
no
case
comparable
to
any
facts
of
this
case
except
possibly
some
old
new
york
cases
representing
a
minority
view
that
would
not
deny
the
appellants
the
taxes
they
are
claiming
to
get
here.
and
in
any
event,
the
only
taxes
they
could
possibly
be
entitled
to
were
taxes
in
regard
to
products
that
they
purchased
that
were
competitive
in
the
marketplace
with
these
two
unique
products,
and
they
have
not
proved
their
case
there.
so
we...
we
submit
they
really
are
not
entitled
to
any
relief
whatsoever.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
and
patience,
and
i
will
sit
down.
