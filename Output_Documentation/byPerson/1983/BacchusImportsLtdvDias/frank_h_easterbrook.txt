mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
requires
wholesalers
of
liquor
to
pay
a
tax
of
20
percent
on
their
wholesale
price.
the
statute
defines
liquor
to
include
all
alcoholic
beverages,
but
it
exempts,
at
least
from
1971
to
1981,
fruit
wine,
okolehao,
made
in
hawaii.
thus,
all
products
from
out
of
state
are
taxed
at
a
20
percent
rate,
while
most
liquor
made
in
hawaii
was
not
taxed.
the
difference
can
be
many
dollars
per
bottle.
the
challenge
we
press
here
is
based
on
the
commerce
clause,
the
import-export
clause,
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
the
principles
underlying
those
clauses
are
very
similar
as
applied
to
differential
taxation
of
interstate
transactions.
i
will
focus
on
the
commerce
claus
at
oral
argument.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
you
mean
if
they
were
administrative
exceptions,
your
honor?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
an
argument
was
raised
in
the
state
court
that
a
tax
of
20
percent
levied
on
a
base
which
includes
all
transportation
charges
and
earlier
taxes
operates
in
practice
as
a
discrimination
under
the
principles
of
pike
against
bruce
church,
but
that
argument
is
not
being
pursued
in
this
court.
the
argument
on
the
commerce
clause
that
we
make
here
is
rather
straightforward.
since
1875
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
may
not
levy
different
taxes
on
products
produced
in
state
and
products
brought
in
from
out
of
state.
such
a
differential
taxation
creates
the
very
multiplicity
of
preferential
trade
zones
that
the
commerce
clause
was
designed
to
eliminate.
in
response
to
that
fairly
simple
argument,
the
state
supreme
court
gave
three
answers.
one
is
that
this
tax
is
not
designed
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
products,
but
instead
to
help
local
hawaiian
industry,
and
that
therefore
it
has
a
legitimate
purpose.
the
second
argument
is
that
it's
permissible
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
products
so
long
as
you
permit
all
wholesalers
to
sell
both
the
taxed
product
and
the
untaxed
product.
and
third,
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
argued
that
the
tax
is
fairly
apportioned.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
did
not
appeal.
they
are
appellees
appearing
in
support
of
appellant.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
can't
speak
for
them,
your
honor,
but
mckesson
has
sent
a
letter
to
the
clerk
saying
that
they
relied
on
the
supreme
court's
rule
that
one
appeal
is
enough
from
a
single
judgment.
there
was
only
one
judgment
entered
by
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii.
and
their
view
was
that
one
appeal
having
been
filed,
they
did
not
need
to
file
additional
notices
of
appeal
to
bring
their
case
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i'm
going
to
try
hard
not
to
talk
about
fee
awards
here.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
have.
mckesson
has
filed
a
brief,
but
i
assume
that
mckesson
is
willing
to
bear
its
own
attorney
fees
as
are
the
other
appellants
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
hmmm-hmm.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we...
we
say
two
things
about
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
the
hawaiian
statute
itself
defines
the
pertinent
category
as
all
alcoholic
beverages;
and
in
fact,
a
hawaii
statute...
it's
hawaii
revised
statute
281-1...
defines
okolehao
to
be
an
alcoholic
beverage.
and
the
second
part
of
our
argument
is
that
alcoholic
beverages
are
reasonably
substitutable
in
use;
that
someone
who
drinks
okolehao
is
doing
that
in
preference
to
tequila
or
benedictine,
someone
who
drinks
the
wine
that
was
made
in
hawaii
is
doing
that
in
preference
to
someone
else's
wine,
and
that
that
form
of
substitution
is
all
that's
necessary.
and
indeed,
that's
why
they
passed
this
statute.
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
one
reason
for
exempting
okolehao
was
to
enable
the
producers
to
advertise
nationwide
and
to
boost
it,
as
the
legislative
history
said,
to
a
position
of
tequila.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
that
the
prohibited
discrimination
is
between
products
and
that
as
a
matter
of
commerce
clause
jurisprudence,
the
highest
tax
that
can
be
levied
on
the
product
that
comes
in
from
out
of
state
is
the
tax
that's
levied
on
the
product
from
in
state,
and
that
taxation
here
is
on
the
product
directly.
two
of
the
three
arguments
i
would
like
to
dismiss
very
quickly,
largely
because
the
state
has
abandoned
them.
one
argument,
which
is
that
it
is
permissible
to
tax
the
products
at
different
rates
as
long
as
you
allow
the
wholesaler
to
sell
the
untaxed
product,
is
inconsistent
with
the
entire
line
of
this
court's
cases,
and
the
state
of
hawaii
has
properly
abandoned
it
in
note
23
of
its
brief
in
this
court.
the
other
argument,
that
so
long
as
the
tax
is
fairly
apportioned
to
transactions
in
hawaii,
the
discrimination
is
all
right,
is
not
even
mentioned
in
this
court
by
the
state
of
hawaii.
none
of
the
apportionment
cases
has
to
do
with
express
discrimination.
well,
that
leaves
the
argument
that
it's
permissible
to
discriminate
because
it's
beneficial
to
hawaiian
industry
to
do
so;
and
that
argument
must
fail,
we
submit,
because
it's
nothing
other
than
a
frontal
assault
on
the
commerce
clause.
this
court
has
implemented
the
commerce
clause
through
a
rule
that
no
state
may
enact
expressly
protectionist
laws.
no
state
may,
at
its
own
say-so,
exalt
its
products
at
the
expense
of
those
from
outside.
now,
we
don't
doubt
that
protectionism
is
often
in
fact
in
the
interest
of
local
industry,
as
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
said
it
was.
we're
not
accusing
the
state
of
hawaii
of
acting
against
its
own
interest
in
passing
this
statute.
but
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
seemed
to
say
that
because
this
statute
is
in
the
interest
of
hawaii
that
it's
not
an
irrational
law;
therefore,
it's
a
constitutional
law.
but
quite
the
contrary.
it's
precisely
because
protectionism
is
so
often
in
the
interest
of
local
prosperity
at
the
expense
of
those
elsewhere
that
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
those
kinds
of
discriminations.
that's
why
the
national
government
must
step
in;
a
beggar
thy
neighbor
policy
is
not
a
constitutional
policy.
discrimination
may
be
practiced
only
if
congress,
on
behalf
of
hawaii's
many
affected
neighbors,
permits
it.
now,
that
antidiscrimination
principle
is
almost
universally
applicable,
and
it's
been
applied
by
this
court
even
when
the
state
has
advanced
a
legitimate
reason
in
support
of
its
discrimination.
in
philadelphia
against
new
jersey,
for
example,
where
the
state
of
new
jersey
attempted
to
prohibit
the
import
of
garbage
from
out
of
state,
the
state
of
new
jersey
adopted
and
advanced
in
this
court
a
rational
justification:
that
is,
protection
of
the
quality
of
its
environment.
and
the
court
said
that
even
a
rational,
well-supported
justification
cannot
excuse
blatant
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
here,
however--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--we
are
seeking
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
and
a
declaratory
order
against
such
discrimination.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the...
it
is
passed
on,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
every
person
in
business
who
wants
to
stay
in
business
must
recover
all
of
his
costs.
to
what
extent
the
tax
is
actually
borne,
the
economic
incidence
of
the
tax
is
borne
by
retailers,
consumers
or
producers...
the
other
possible
people...
we
simply
don't
know.
the
state...
you
may
be
referring,
your
honor,
to
an
argument
that
the
state
has
made
in
this
court,
that
the
tax
was
passed
on.
that
argument
was
not
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii,
and
we
take
it
as
foreclosed
here
by
not
having
been
made
there.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not,
because
the
declaratory
judgment
in
prospective
relief
only
allows
the
state
to
keep
the
proceeds
of
the
discrimination.
it
invites--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--i...
i
hate
to
talk
about
this
as
windfalls,
just
as
my
friend
in
the
preceding
case
hated
to
talk
about
windfalls.
but,
you
know,
if
it
is
permitted
to
collect
and
keep
the
discriminatory
tax,
then
every
state's
incentive
is
to
levy
a
discriminatory
tax
and
see
how
long
they
can
get
away
with
it
until
someone
finally
gets
a
declaratory
order
to
stop
it.
the
tax
injunction
act
requires
as
a
condition
of
litigation
that
taxes
be
paid
in
to
the
claiming
state,
and
that
means
effectively
that
a
rule
that
the
appellants
here
could
not
get
refunds
would
be
a
rule
inviting
states
to
pass
and
maintain
discriminatory
taxes.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
are
two
principal
reasons
for
that,
justice
behnquist.
one
is,
as
i
said
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
the
argument
that
refunds
are
inappropriate
was
never
made
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
it's
a
brand-new
argument
which
we
take
it
is
foreclosed
to
the
state.
this
was
brought
as
a
suit
for
refund
of
taxes.
the
state
was
entitled
to
defend
on
the
ground
that--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--your
honor,
we
have
no
doubt...
we
are
expressing
no
doubt
today
that
for
the
future
it
is
perfectly
adequate
for
hawaii
to
eliminate
the
exemption
and
to
tax
everyone
at
20
percent.
we
have
no
doubt
about
that.
the
question
is
what
happens
to
transactions
with
respect
to
which
the
tax
has
already
been
levied
and
collected
and
the
state
does
not
propose
to
go
out
and
tax
the
other
people
at
20
percent.
the
whole
series
of
commerce
clause
decisions
that
this
court
has
had
since
1875
and
on
which
we're
relying
were
almost
to
a
case
either
suits
for
refund
of
taxes
or
suits
to
avoid
the
state's
claim
for
penalty.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes.
the
transactions--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--the
transactions
we're
concerned
about
here
are
past
transactions.
the
tax
has
been
collected;
it
is
in
the
state's
treasury.
and
the
exemptions
which
give
rise
to
this
particular
case
expired
in
1981.
there's
a
new
exemption
passed
which
is
now
in
effect
for
rum,
and
a
declaratory
order
of
the
sort
justice
rehnquist
described
might
be
most
appropriate
for
the
rum
exemption
for
the
future.
but
these
transactions
are
transactions
from
1974
to
1981
with
respect
to
the
other
exemption.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
for
the
position
about
the
refund
of
taxes?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
we
have--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--yes.
our
reply
brief
collects
quite
a
series
of
them
at
footnote
9,
i
believe.
the
very
first
case
in
the
series
was
a
case
to
avoid
criminal
prosecution
for
refusal
to
pay
the
tax.
the
james
b.
beam
case,
on
which
we
have
heavily
relied,
is
a
suit
for
refund
of
tax.
the
i.m.
darnell
case
is
a
suit
for
refund
of
the
tax.
i
think
those
three
are
substantial
support
for
our
position.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we...
we
believe
it
will
be
open
for
the
future.
the
state
is
not
under--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--as
we
understand
hawaii
practice,
it
follows
the
federal
rule
that
new
arguments
cannot
be
injected
into
a
case
so
late
as
this
one.
but
our
view,
your
honor,
is
that
for
the
past
transactions,
the
transactions
from
1974
to
'81
for
which
a
refund
is
claimed,
no
remedy
would
be
sufficient
unless
it
restored
those
transactions
to
equal
status.
the
state
has
not
offered
to
go
out
and
collect
the
20
percent
tax
on
okolehao.
in
fact,
a
case
called--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--it
might
be
cheaper
for
the
state,
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
have
avoided
the
harm
in
this
case.
in
a
case
called
ward
against
love
county
back
in
1920,
the
state
made,
as
i
recall,
almost
an
identical
argument
in
a
discriminatory
taxation
case.
and
the
argument
was
that
there
was
in
fact
absolutely
no
state
authority
for
the
refund
of
taxes,
and
therefore,
the
only
permissible
relief
was
prospective
relief.
this
court
rejected
the
argument
in
ward
on
the
ground
that
retrospective
relief
was
necessary
to
assure
the
equal
treatment,
and
the
lack
of
state
authority
for
the
refund
could
not
stand
in
the
way.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
stipulations
in
this
case
recite
the
taxes
made
the
liquors
brought
in
from
out
of
state
relatively
less
attractive
compared
to
other
liquors.
when
your
price
rises
relative
to
the
price
of
other
liquors,
you
will
sell
less,
you
will
have
to
sell
on
a
lower
margin.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
the
stipulation
which
appears
at
page
10
of
the
joint
appendix
about
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
hawaiian
statute
of
limitations
is
five
years,
and
the
claim
here
was
made
in
1979
back
to
1974
consistent
with
the
hawaiian
statute.
we're
not
doubting
that
statute.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
understand
that.
your
honor.
the
stipulation
is,
i
am
afraid,
ambiguous.
i
would
like
to
mention
just
briefly
an
argument
that
hawaii
now
makes
in
this
court.
in
the
state
court
the
issue
was
joined
rather
squarely
on
the
meaning
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
in
fact,
at
page
29
of
its
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii,
the
state
expressly
repudiated
any
reliance
on
the
21st
amendment.
in
this
court
the
state
now
relies
on
the
21st
amendment.
needless
to
say,
our
first
response
to
that
is
that
the
claim
is
not
preserved,
it
is
not
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
and
that
an
effort
by
the
state
to
invoke
a
new
source
of
federal
authority,
which
is
has
never
invoked
in
the
state
court,
is
not
appropriate
at
this
late
stage.
in
fact,
illinois
against
gates
is
perhaps
our
strongest
support
for
that
position.
nevertheless,
the
distinction
between
a
new
ground
and
an
elaboration
of
the
commerce
clause
ground
is
a
rather
fine
one;
and
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
21st
amendment
argument,
just
in
the
event
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
contention
that
it's
not
properly
preserved.
we
have
made
two
principal
points
about
the
21st
amendment.
one
is
that
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
state
liquor
laws
must
yield
when
they
conflict
with
actual
federal
statutes
enacted
pursuant
to
federal
authority.
the
idlewild-bon
voyage
liquor
case
is
such
a
case
involving
federal
customs
statute,
and
the
mid-cal
case
on
antitrust
laws.
there
are
many
other
federal
statutes
in
this
field.
the
alcohol
administration
act,
which
was
passed
at
the
same
time
as
the
21st
amendment,
is
a
rather
detailed
regulatory
scheme.
there
is
such
a
statute
in
this
case.
the
wilson
act,
enacted
in
1890,
expressly
provides
that
states
must
be
evenhanded
between
in-state
and
out-of-state
products
in
their
regulation
of
alcohol.
in
fact,
it
says
that
states
have
to
proceed...
and
i
quote...
"to
the
same
extent
and
in
the
same
manner
as
though
such
liquids
or
liquors
had
been
produced
in
such
state.
"
and
scott
against
donald
in
1897
held
that
that
means
exactly
what
it
says.
the
other--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--since
the
state
had
refused
to
rely
on
the
21st
amendment,
the
court
below
said
nothing
about
any
of
this,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
was
just
not
an
issue.
it
has
become
an
issue
only
because
of
the
state's
new
contention.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
statute,
the
state
statute,
the
south
carolina
statute,
which
this
court
considered
in
scott
against
donald,
was
a
statute
that
did
exactly
that,
your
honor.
it
prohibited
the
import
into
south
carolina
of
alcoholic
beverages,
but
allowed
people
in
south
carolina
to
brew
their
own
and
sell
it
to
their
hearts'
content.
this
court
held
that
the
wilson
act
absolutely
prohibited
that
state
statute,
and
we
think
the
same
would
be
the
case
today
under
the
wilson
act.
the...
more
generally,
the
purpose
of
the
21st
amendment
as
this
court
has
construed
it,
especially
in
cases
like
mid-cal,
has
been
to
preserve
a
sphere
within
which
the
state
may
regulate
in
the
name
of
temperance
free
of
the
meandering
path
of
commerce
clause
cases,
which
in
the
past,
especially
the
original
package
doctrine
cases
and
the
decision
in
leisy
against
hardin,
it
made
it
difficult,
even
impossible,
for
a
state
that
desired
to
adopt
temperance
rules
to
adopt
and
enforce
those
rules.
the
21st
amendment
made
it
sure
that
a
state
that
wanted
temperance
could
get
it
despite
the
original
package
line
of
cases.
it
established
concurrent
powers.
but
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
state
advocates
that
it
has
a
temperance
interest
at
heart.
quite
the
contrary.
the
interest
the
state
advocates
is
in
getting
more
okolehao
sold
and
more
hawaiian
fruit
wine
sold
to
the
extent
it
can
possibly
do
that
through
this
statute.
so
since
the
kind
of
interest
involved
in
this
case
is
not
even
assumed...
not
even
asserted
to
be
a
temperance
interest,
the
state's
argument
on
the
21st
amendment
ultimately
is
unsuccessful.
in
all
events,
it
seems
to
me
important
that
as
it
survives
now,
it
is
at
best
a
very
attenuated
argument.
it's
an
argument
that
you
can
think
about
the
commerce
clause
through
the
lens
of
the
21st
amendment.
and
given
that
attentuation,
the
state's
argument
is
very
weak.
on
the
other
hand,
we
invoke
on
our
behalf
the
james
beam
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
foreign
commerce
clause
makes
it
impossible
for
a
state
to
levy
discriminatory
taxes
on
liquor
when
they
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
by
the
foreign
commerce
clause.
our
argument
is
very
simple.
it's
that
the
interstate
commerce
clause
has
the
same
force
in
liquor
cases
as
the
foreign
commerce
clause
does
under
the
doctrine
of
beam.
finally,
the
state
has
made
a
number
of
arguments
which
can
be
described
only
as
fairness
arguments.
the
arguments
have
to
do
with
retroactivity,
with
the
passing
on
argument
and
so
on.
as
i
said
earlier
in
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question,
those
arguments
were
not
raised
below;
but
we
think
it
important
to
the
extent
they
are
here
at
all
simply
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
chevron
oil
case
where
there
has
been
a
sudden,
elusive
change
in
the
law
which
the
state
could
not
have
anticipated.
since
1875
taxes
of
this
sort
have
been
plainly
unlawful.
since
1897
when
this
court
construed
the
wilson
act,
they
have
been
unlawful
as
applied
to
liquor.
and
a
whole
lot
of
that
line
of
cases
has
been
cases
for
the
refund
of
taxes.
so
ultimately,
what
the
state
is
arguing
in
its
fairness
argument
is
that
its
tax
is
so
large
that
the
discrimination
between
the
in-state
and
the
out-of-state
products
is
so
great
that
it
really
ought
to
be
allowed
to
keep
it.
and
that's
kind
of
like
the
argument
of
someone
who's
murdered
both
of
his
parents
and
gets
called
before
the
bar
that
he
shouldn't
get
punished
because
he's
an
orphan;
that
he's
made
the
stakes
so
big
that
he
is
entitled,
therefore,
to
immunity.
well,
the
argument
doesn't
fly
for
the
orphan,
i
don't
think
it
flies
for
the
state
of
hawaii,
and
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thanks
very
much.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
do,
your
honor.
a
few
brief
words
about
the
argument
about
the
extent
of
competition.
i'm
perfectly
delighted
to
concede
that
was
not
tried
as
an
antitrust
case.
we
don't
have
a
section
7
clayton
act
market
definition
in
this
case.
there
were
some
good
reasons
why
that's
true.
one
is
that
the
stipulation
wasn't
addressed
to
this
because
the
state
never
asserted
this
in
the
initial
court,
and
it's
very
difficult
as
a
practical
matter
for
litigants
to
cover
in
stipulations
things
that
their
opponents
aren't
denying.
the
statute
in
this
case
defines
the
pertinent
category
as
all
liquor,
and
it
seemed
plausible
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
take
the
state
at
its
word,
at
least
until
the
state
should
deny
it.
the
argument,
by
the
way,
that
because
okolehao
is
produced
only
in
hawaii
it
doesn't
compete
with
grand
marnier,
which
is
produced
only
in
france,
for
example,
is
very
strange
as
a
market
definition.
ordinarily,
one
assumes
that
in
most
of
these
commerce
clause
cases
things
are
coming
from
different
places,
and
they're
made
in
different
places
and
moved.
in
any
event,
this
whole
extent
of
effect
point
is
i
think
a
point
that
is
important
only
in
the
event
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
statute
which
is
neutral
on
its
face,
and
there's
a
dispute
about
whether
it
has
a
discriminatory
impact,
the
kind
of
dispute
that's
involved
in
a
case
like
pike
against
bruce
church.
this
is
not
a
statute
that's
neutral
on
its
face
and
we're
disputing
discriminatory
impact.
this
statute
is
discriminatory
on
its
face.
when
the
statute
is
discriminatory
on
its
face,
one
stops.
we've
cited
in
note
4
of
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
of
this
court
that
hold
that...
of
our
reply
brief,
sorry...
and
the
baldwin
against
gaf-sealey
case
says
that,
too,
and
that's
at
page
19
of
our
opening
brief.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
in
that
event
the
argument
would
be
much
more
difficult.
the
argument
would
look
more
like
tiernan
against
rinker
where
there
was
such
a
statute.
in
that
event
we
might
well
have
to
come
in
and
supply
proof
of
competition
in...
and
that
might
prove
to
be
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do.
the
clayton
act
market
definitions
are
not
the
easiest
thing
to
do
on
the
back
of
an
envelope.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
think
it
would
probably
be
open
to
the
state
if
it
wanted
to
contradict
the
category
of
competition
established
in
the
state's
own
statute
to
offer
and
make
this
kind
of
proof.
we
suggest
in
our
reply
brief,
in
fact,
that
if
hawaii
had
levied
a
20
percent
tax
on
all
things
with
alcohol
in
them
and
then
exempted
aftershave
lotion,
in
a
suit
by
sellers
of
whiskey
the
state
would
be
entitled
to
defend
by
saying
that
aftershave
lotion
just
doesn't
compete
with
whiskey,
so
why
are
we
here.
but
given
that
these
are
all
alcoholic
beverages,
it's
an--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
--right.
aftershave
lotion
is
sometimes
drunk
for
that
purpose,
your
honor,
but
not
generally.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
not
regularly.
my
last
word
is
on
tiernan
against
rinker,
and
that
is
that
i
think
the
court
was
drawing
a
distinction
license
tax,
which
applied
to
everyone
who
sold
any
alcoholic
beverages...
there
was
adequate
ground
for
levying
that
tax
on
people
who
sold
the
in-state
beverage...
and
tax
by
the
bottle
or
by
the
drink.
in
fact,
the
tiernan
court
says
"a
tax
cannot
be
exacted
for
the
sale
of
beer
and
wines
when
of
foreign
manufacture
if
not
exacted
when
of
home
manufacture.
"
we
are
perfectly
delighted
to
rely
on
that
language
in
tiernan
against
rinker.
thank
you
very
much.
