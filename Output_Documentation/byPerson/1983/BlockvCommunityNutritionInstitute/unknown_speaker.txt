unknown
speaker
ms.
oberly,
in
that
connection
why
was
the
handler
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
your
position
there
isn't
dependent
on
what
you
concede
to
be
the
small
benefit
that
consumers...
consumers
might
obtain.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
a
handler
normally
be
a
consumer,
too?
unknown
speaker
what
about
producers?
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
unknown
speaker
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
the...
of
the
chaos
you
say
would
result
from
letting
consumers
sue
every
week,
producers
are
the
ones
who...
for
whose
benefit
the
statute
was
really
passed,
and
if
they
don't
think
they're
getting
a
good
enough
deal,
i
suppose
every
week
they
could
come
in
and...
under
stark
v.
wickard
and
upset
the
secretary's
applicant.
unknown
speaker
or
milkcart.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why...
why...
why
stark
v.
wickard?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
any
one
of
the
third
who
didn't
vote
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
in
this
case,
though,
the
consumers
weren't
really
asserting
a
separate
interest
as
consumers.
weren't
they
basically
asserting
the
same
interest
as
the
handlers?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
they--
unknown
speaker
--they
said
in
this
case
that
they
could;
that
if
handlers
got
a
bigger
break,
the
consumers...
that
would
trickle
down.
unknown
speaker
what...
what
particular
aspect
of
standing
do
you
rely
on
mostly?
unknown
speaker
zone
of
interest,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't...
aren't
the
producers
subject
to
that
same
regulation?
just
as
the
handlers
can't
enter
into
a
contract
to
buy
milk
on
conditions
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
marketing
order,
aren't
producers
likewise
forbidden
to
enter
into
a
contract
inconsistent
with
the
marketing
order?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any...
any
study
at
any
time
that
showed
that
any
regulation
cut
prices,
resulted
in
the
consumer
getting
a
lower
price?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
hope
to
get?
unknown
speaker
mr.
plesser,
you're
talking
now,
i
guess,
about
kind
of
questions
of
fact
involving
standing.
you
say
one
thing;
the
government
says
another
thing.
and
i
notice
that
judge
wilkie's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
opinion
there,
devotes
some
attention.
how
are
these
kind
of
factual
questions
resolved
at
the
pleading
stage?
is
the
court
required
simply
to
take
your
allegations?
can
it
make
some
sort
of
factual
inquiry?
what
is
the
test?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
would
stop
short
of
a
full
dress
trial
on
that
issue,
i
take
it,
before
you--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
plesser,
even
assuming
that
your
clients
have
standing,
isn't
the
more
difficult
question
whether
the
whole
statutory
scheme
just
precludes
giving
relief
to
consumers?
it
seems
to
have
been
designed
to
keep
prices
up
for
producers,
not
to
get
them
down
for
consumers.
how
do
you
fit
into
the
scheme
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
to
get...
to
get
standing,
you
have
to
allege
that
you're
going
to
have
lower
prices,
and
that
certainly
seems
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
concept
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
so-called
zone
of
interest
test
still
has
relevance
in
determining
standing?
unknown
speaker
why
do...
why
do
the
consumers...
why
do
the
consumers
satisfy
that
test?
unknown
speaker
does
that
apply
to
all
consumers?
unknown
speaker
don't
go
too
far,
because
i'm
going
to
get
a
consumer
over
in
west
africa
in
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
i
said
a
consumer,
somebody
that
consumes
this
milk,
somebody
that
consumes
milk.
unknown
speaker
he'd
have
all
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
not
disqualified,
and
all
nine
of
us?
don't
we
have
an
interest?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
oberly,
what
if
i
as
a
consumer
said
i
wanted
to
have
a
particular
kind
of
cheese
available,
and
that
i
couldn't
find
it
on
the
market?
would
it
be
an
adequate
answer
to
my
lawsuit
on
my
standing
to
say
well,
you
can
make
that
kind
of
cheese
at
home;
just
go
out
and
buy
some
milk
and
churn
it
and
so
forth?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
make
it?
unknown
speaker
how's
it
taste?
unknown
speaker
it
depends
on
how
much
you
like
milk.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
is
it
different
from
the
dry
milk
they
had
in
the
war?
unknown
speaker
i
can
only
say
i
hope.
[laughter]
