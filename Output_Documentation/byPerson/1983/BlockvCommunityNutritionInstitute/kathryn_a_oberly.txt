ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
are
three
individual
consumers
who
want
to
buy
reconstituted
milk,
which
is
milk
made
from
powder
and
water
and
occasionally
blended
with
a
portion
of
fresh
milk,
at
a
price
below
the
price
they
would
pay
for
the
price
of
regular
fresh
milk.
their
complaint
is
that
federal
milk
market
orders
issued
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
make
it
uneconomical
for
milk
handlers
to
manufacture
the
product
they
want,
and
so
they're
attacking
the
federal
orders.
the
issue
for
this
court
is
whether
ultimate
consumers
of
milk
products
are
proper
parties
to
challenge
the
minimum
wholesale
prices
that
milk
handlers
are
required
to
pay
to
farmers.
when
this
suit
was
first
filed,
the
three
individual
consumers
were
joined
by
a
milk
handler
and
a
nutrition
organization
as
co-plaintiffs.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
entire
case,
holding
that
both
the
organization
and
the
consumers
lacked
standing,
and
that
the
handler
had
failed
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
handler
and
the
nutrition
organization,
but
it
held
that
the
consumers
had
standing
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
trial
on
the
merits.
the
milk
market
order
program,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
prior
cases,
is
extraordinarily
complex,
and
so
i
will
try
to
limit
my
description
of
it
to
just
a
layman's
description
of
those
provisions
of
the
program
that
affect
the
issues
in
this
case.
probably
the
most
important
aspect
of
milk
market
orders
is
the
classified
pricing
system
embodied
in
those
orders,
and
that
system
has
always
been
a
feature
of
the
dairy
industry,
even
before
orders
came
into
being
in
the
early
1930s.
milk...
under
this
system,
milk
that's
used
for
drinking
purposes
commands
a
higher
price,
known
as
class
i.
milk
that's
made
into
manufactured
products
such
as
cheese
or
milk
powder
sells
at
a
lower
class
ii
or
class
iii
price.
the
statute
requires
handlers,
who
are
essentially
middlemen,
to
pay
farmers
according
to
the
end
use
to
which
the
raw
milk
is
put.
in
other
words,
if
a
handler
buys
milk
and
sells
it
for
drinking
purposes,
he
pays
class
i
prices
for
it.
if
he
buys
the
same
raw
milk
and
makes
it
into
cheese
and
sells
it
as
cheese,
then
he
pays
class
ii
or
class
iii
lower
prices
for
it.
but
to
protect
farmers
against
destructive
competition
for
sales
in
the
desirable
fluid
market,
the
handlers'
payments
are
pooled,
and
farmers
get
paid
a
uniform
blend
price
regardless
of
the
use
to
which
the
milk
of
an
individual
farmer
is
put.
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
this
classified
pricing
system,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
regulates,
and
has
since
1964,
reconstituted
fluid
milk
as
if
it
were
a
class
i
product.
in
other
words,
if
a
handler
buys
powder,
then
turns
around
and
reconstitutes
it
into
fluid
milk,
he
pays
for
the
powder
or
the
raw
milk
that
he
uses
to
make
the
powder
at
class
i
prices.
if
he
uses
the
powder
to
make
ice
cream
or
some
other
nondrinking
purpose,
then
he
pays
for
it
as
a
class
ii
or
a
class
iii
product.
respondents'
goal
in
this
case
is
to
let
handlers
pay
for
raw
milk
at
the
class...
the
lowest
class
iii
price,
even
if
the
handlers
turn
around
and
make
the
powder
into
fluid
milk
that
competes
directly
with
fresh
milk
for
fluid
sales.
as
i'll
discuss
in
a
moment,
we
think
that
respondents
are
precluded
from
litigating
what's
basically
a
handlers'
grievance
about
the
prices
that
handlers
pay.
first
the
court
should
consider
that
this
lawsuit
as
a
factual
matter
really
makes
very
little
sense.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
justice
blackmun,
the
statute,
as
i'll
explain,
has
a
specific
and
detailed
review
procedures...
procedure
for
handlers
who
wish
to
challenge
a
milk
market
order.
the
first
step
in
that
procedure
is
under
608c(15)(a)
of
the
statute.
7
u.s.c.
608c(15)(a)
requires
a
handler
to
file
a
petition
for
review
with
the
secretary,
and
the
secretary
then
holds
a
formal
adjudicatory,
on
the
record
hearing,
reaches
a
decision
on
the
handler's
petition,
and
if
the
handler
is
dissatisfied,
the
handler
is
then
afforded
a
right
of
judicial
review
in
district
court.
the
handler
in
this
case
did
not
and
has
not
to
this
date
filed
such
a
petition.
factually,
we
are
at
somewhat
of
a
loss
to
understand
the
sense
of
this
case.
as
best
we
can
tell,
respondents'
complaint,
even
though
they
phrased
it
in
terms
of
price,
is
simply
a
matter
of
convenience.
the
potential
savings
per
consumers
is
negligible.
it's
82
cents
a
year
per
capita,
and
that's
if
all
variables
operate
in
consumers'
favor.
but
consumers
could
save
more
than
that
by
making
reconstituted
milk
at
home,
because
they
would
be
saving
for
themselves
the
manufacturer's
processing
and
marketing
costs.
there's
no
nutritional
difference
between
the
product
that
a
manufacturer
would
sell
and
what
a
consumer
would
make
at
home;
and
there's
no
real
aesthetic
difference
either.
in
the
past
and
in
the
allegations
in
this
complaint,
consumers
allege
that
they
prefer
the
test
of
manufacturer-reconstituted
milk
because
it
has
a
butterfat
content;
but
the
record
in
this
case,
the
agriculture
department's
impact
statement
of
respondents'
proposal,
demonstrates
that
it's
possible
to
make
a
product
at
home
that's
virtually
indistinguishable
in
taste
from
the
product
that
these
respondents
want
to
buy
in
a
store
by
simply
blending
powdered
milk
and
water
and
some
portion
of
fresh
milk.
so
in
our
view
this
case
does
come
down
to
a
consumer
interest
in
convenience.
they
would
rather
be
able
to
buy
the
product
in
the
store
for
slightly
more
money
than
they
could...
than
it
would
cost
to
make
them
at
home.
our
position
as
a
matter
of
law
is
that
congress
never
intended
to
permit
consumer
attacks
on
market
orders,
but
that
it
certainly
didn't
intend
to
let
consumers
upset
such
a
delicate
regulatory
scheme
for
convenience.
respondents--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no.
we
would...
as
a
legal
matter
we
would
say
that
all
consumer
suits
are
precluded,
even
if
they
were
more
substantial
than
this
one.
but
in
considering
whether
congress
could
have
intended
this
much
disruption
to
be
visited
upon
its
program,
we
think
it's
relevant
for
the
court
to
consider
what's
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
in
this
case.
respondents
contend
that
they're
entitled
to
maintain
this
suit
under
the
apa,
but
the
apa
has
its
own
preclusion
provision
that
prohibits
review
whenever
review
is
precluded
by
the
relevant
statute.
here,
of
course,
the
relevant
statute
is
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act.
that
statute,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
sets
up
a
special
scheme
for
handlers
to
get
review
of
market
orders;
and
it's
clear
that
consumer
suits
would
be
completely
inconsistent
with
congress'
plan
for
handler
review.
this
court
has
never
permitted
the
apa
to
be
used
as
a
way
for
strangers
to
a
regulatory
program
to
get
greater
rights
to
review
than
the
parties
that
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
in
the
statute.
but
that
would
be
the
effect
of
allowing
consumer
suits
attacking
market
orders
to
be
brought
under
the
apa.
the
basic
problem
with
respondents'
lawsuit,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
they're
attempting
to
litigate
someone
else's
rights...
handlers'
rights.
the
suit
really
isn't
about
the
prices
that
consumers
pay
for
milk
or
milk
products;
it's
about
the
order
prices
that
handlers
pay
to
farmers.
and
as
to
those
prices,
the
act
does
set
up
the
detailed
and
specific
scheme
that
i
mentioned
for
handlers
to
challenge
the
secretary's
actions.
it
requires,
first,
administrative
exhaustion,
and
then
if
the
handler
is
dissatisfied,
and
only
then,
may
he
go
to
court.
so
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
issue
preclusion,
but
party
preclusion.
the
statute
clearly
does
allow
the
issues
that
the
consumers
are
interested
in
to
be
litigated,
but
that
litigation
under
congress'
scheme
is
to
be
conducted
by
handlers.
and
what's
most
striking
about
this
case
is
that
the
consumers
did
have
a
handler
in
the
case
who
was
interested
in
litigating
the
issue
that
the
consumers
want
to
bring
before
the
court,
but
as
both
courts
below
held,
that
handler
failed
to
follow
the
statutory
scheme
for
exhaustion.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
he
would,
and
that,
we
think,
is
a
very
serious
problem
with
respondents'
lawsuit.
any
handler,
if
he
is
an
individual,
presumably
drinks
milk
and
is
a
consumer.
if
he's
a
corporation,
he's
ultimately
owned
by
consumers.
and
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
all
he
has
to
do
in
the
future
is
instead
of
coming
to
the
secretary
first
and
then
the
court
through
the
statutory
scheme
as
a
handler,
is
come
directly
into
court
and
say
i'm
here
as
a
consumer
of
milk.
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
congress'
scheme
for
administrative
exhaustion
followed
by
judicial
review
at
the
behest
of
a
handler.
handlers
would
just
turn
into
consumers
or
align
themselves
with
consumers.
if
a
court
might
pierce
through
the
sham
of
a
handler
trying
to
litigate
as
a
consumer,
then
consumers
and
handlers
need
only
join
together,
as
they
did
in
this
case
and
as
they
did
in
the
similar
ninth
circuit
case
of
rasmussen
v.
hardin.
and
you
then
have
handlers
litigating
as
consumers,
but
not
in
the
way
that
congress
has
specified
handlers
are
to
bring
these
claims
to
the
secretary's
and
the
court's
attention.
our
basic
position
is
that
when
congress
has
said
how
it
wants
a
statute
to
be
enforced,
and
here
it's
said
how
handlers
are
to
enforce
these
provisions,
then
there's
no
room
for
other
parties
who
are
complete
strangers
to
the
regulatory
scheme
to
come
in
and
litigate
someone
else's
rights
and
liabilities.
we
really
think
it's
quite
inconceivable
that
congress
could
have
intended
to
let
consumers
litigate
handlers'
rights.
one
is
the
reason
that
i
just
gave
to
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist;
that
that
would
complete
eviscerate
congress'
scheme
for
handler...
excuse
me...
handler
administrative
review
followed
by
judicial
review.
also,
suits
by
handlers
acting
as
consumers
or
just
plain
consumers
would
cause
chaos
in
the
regulatory
program
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended.
every
time
this
court
has
considered
a
case
under
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act,
it's
noted
how
complex
the
statute
is.
in
the
case
of
milk,
the
market
order
prices
change
monthly.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
appear
to
allow
consumers
to
come
in
every
month
and
attack
those
price
changes.
in
the
fruit
and
vegetable
area,
which
is
regulated
by
the
same
section
of
the
statute
that
regulates
milk,
the
orders
are
even
more
complex.
there
are
changes
made
every
week
during
the
marketing
season.
again,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
appear
to
allow
consumers
to
come
in
every
week
and
challenge
the
secretary's
actions.
i'd
like
to
give
an
example
in
the
fruit
and
vegetable
area
that
may
sound
a
little
silly,
but
to
me
it's
really
no
more
farfetched
than
respondents'
monetary
stake
in
this
lawsuit.
the
market
orders
regulating
commodities
such
as
lemons
don't
control
prices
directly
like
the
milk
market
orders
do,
but
instead
they
do...
they
do
it
by
controlling
the
quantity
of
a
product
like
lemons
that
can
be
brought
to
market
each
week.
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
a
lemon
advisory
committee
makes
recommendations
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
about
how
many
lemons
should
be
marketed
each
week,
but
during
the
course
of
the
season,
the
lemon
committee
looks
at
the
results
of
the
previous
week's
marketing
efforts
and
decides
whether
to
recommend
changes.
the
secretary
then
enacts
those
changes.
under
the
court
of
appeals
decisions,
consumers
could
bring
suit
every
week
and
claim
that
if
the
secretary
had
simply
allowed
more
lemons
to
get
to
market,
then
consumers
could
have
shaved
a
few
pennies
off
their
grocery
bills.
and
since
consumers
don't
have
to
bring
their
grievances
to
the
secretary
first,
we
would
then
have
the
courts
in
the
business
of
deciding
how
many
lemons
should
be
marketed
each
week.
we
think
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
intended
this
complex
statutory
scheme
to
operate
in
that
manner.
besides
the
fact
that
the
secretary's
expertise
would
be
lost
to
the
courts,
it's
obvious
that
suits
like
this
would
cause
chaos
in
a
program
that
has
market
stability
as
one
of
its
primary
purposes.
when
congress
gave
handlers
a
right
of
review,
it
was
careful
to
balance
that
right
against
the
needs
of
the
industry
for
stability.
it
provided
that
a
handler
review
petition,
whether
pending
before
the
secretary
or
in
court,
can't
be
used
to
impede,
hinder
or
delay
the
secretary's
ability
to
obtain
handler
compliance
with
existing
market
orders.
but
a
consumer
suit
under
the
apa
would
not
be
subject
to
any
such
limitations.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
producers,
your
honor,
we
think
are
clearly
different
than
consumers.
respondents--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--pardon?
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
respondents
rely
heavily
on
the
court's
decision
in
stark
v.
wickard
which
allows
producers
to
sue
even
though
they're
not
expressly
mentioned
in
the
statute.
but
there
are
several
different
features
about
producers.
one
of
the
most
important
is
this
statute
was
passed
expressly
for
the
benefit
of
producers.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
haven't--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
seems
much
less
likely
that
they
would
do
that,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
gives
them
a
different
form
of
protection
in
that
market
orders
can't
be
adopted
unless
two-thirds
of
the
producers
vote
for
them.
if
the...
if
the
producers
are
unhappy
with
the
orders,
a
majority
of
them
can
require
the
secretary
to
terminate
the
order.
and
so
they're
included
and
given
great
protection
in
the
administrative
level
of
the
statutory
scheme.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
not
every
producer
is
always
going
to
be
happy,
and
there
are
some
producer
suits.
but--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's
correct.
but
not
any
one
of
the
nation's
entire
stock
of
consumers,
which
is
basically
every
household
in
the
nation.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
noted
in
the
rasmussen
case,
the
statute
is
a
cooperative
venture
between
producers,
handlers
and
the
secretary,
and
consumers
are
outside
of
that
venture.
and
the
statute
goes
to
great
lengths
to
protect
the
interests
of
consumers,
and
this
court
has
added
an
additional
level
of
protection
in
its
decision
in
stark.
consumers
just
aren't
in
this
scheme,
and
there's
no
rationale
for
extending
stark
to
the
situation
of
consumers.
i
might
also...
in
the
same
point--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that's...
yes,
and
that's
another
problem
with
their
lawsuit.
they're
litigating
somebody
else's
rights.
they
don't...
they
can't
legitimately
care
about
what
handlers
pay
to
farmers
at
the
wholesale
level.
they
only
care
about
the
trickledown
effect,
if
they
can
even
show
that
there
is
such
an
effect--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--at
retail
prices.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
we
dispute
that,
your
honor,
in
our
argument
on
standing;
that
we
think
they're
unable
to
show
redressability.
but
even
if...
i
mean
in
this
suit
they're
litigating
handlers'
rights
to
lower
payments.
they
have
a
handler
who
says
that
he's
ready
to
litigate
the
same
issue,
only
he
hasn't
followed
the
proper
procedure.
when
mr.
oberweiss,
the
handler
who
was
dismissed
from
the
case,
is
out
there
and
able
to
do
exactly...
to
litigate
this
issue
in
exactly
the
manner
that
congress
intended,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
allowed
strangers
to
come
in
and
litigate
the
same
issue
but
not
go
through
the
procedures
specified
in
the
statute.
one
other
difference,
justice
white,
between
consumers
and
producers
is
that
basically
the
market
orders
are
government-ordered
contracts
between
handlers
and
producers;
and
it
would
be
quite
unfair
and
perhaps
even
unconstitutional
to
say
that
one
party
to
the
contract,
the
handler,
can
sue,
but
the
other
party
to
the
contract,
whose
personal
proprietary
rights
are
affected,
can't
sue
because
congress
didn't
mention
them.
the
same
thing
is
not
true
of
consumers.
the
consumers
are
not
parties
to
these
minimum
wholesale
price
contracts
between
producers
and
consumers.
they're
suing
on
somebody
else's
rights,
and
we
think
that's
a
substantial
difference.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
we
think--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--we
think
they've
failed
at
least
three
standing
tests.
zone
of
interest
is
one;
generalized
grievance
is
another;
and
redressability
is
the
third.
i
was
planning
in
my
argument
to
focus
on
redressability,
just
due
to
time
limitations
and
because
we
had
briefed
zone
of
interest
more
thoroughly
in
the
brief.
and
as
for
the
zone
of
interest
problem
with
this
case,
there
basically
are
three
or
four
or
even
more
different
factors
that
would
all
have
to
coalesce
in
respondents'
favor
before
there
could
be
any
substantial
probability
that
respondents'
injury
would
be
redressed
by
a
favorable
judicial
decision.
the
first
is
that
respondents
live
in
florida,
texas
and
arkansas,
but
they
haven't
alleged
that
there
are
any
handlers
who
are
interested
in
making
the
product
they
want
and
marketing
it
in
the
areas
where
they
live.
the
one
handler,
oberweiss,
who
was
dismissed
from
this
case,
operates
in
the
chicago
area;
but
he's
never
alleged
that
he
would
market
reconstituted
milk
where
the
respondents
live.
the
examples
in
the
record
indicate
that
it's
actually
quite
unlikely
that
milk
handlers
would
go
into
the
business
of
marketing
reconstituted
milk.
as
an
example,
the
impact
statement
in
this
case
notes
that
the
entire
state
of
california
is
unregulated
by
federal
market
orders,
and
yet
there's
still
no
reconstituted
milk
made
in
that
state.
another
example
is
the
one
relied
on
respondents
in
north
carolina,
which
is
also
an
unregulated
market.
reconstituted
milk
was
sold
there
for
a
while,
but
then
the
manufacturer
on
his
own
simply
decided
to
stop
making
it.
his
action
obviously
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
milk
market
orders
because
the
area
is
still
unregulated,
and
yet
the
product
isn't
available
in
that
area.
even
if
respondents
could
find
a
handler
who
wanted
to
market
reconstituted
milk
in
their
area,
they
are
unable
to
show
that
the
handlers'
cost
savings
would
be
passed
on
to
consumers.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
when
farm
prices
increase,
consumers
do
see
that
at
the
retail
level;
but
when
farm
prices
decrease,
as
would
be
the
case
here,
handlers
frequently
keep
a
substantial
portion
of
the
savings
for
themselves
rather
than
passing
it
on
to
the
consumers.
another
point
is
the
department
of
agriculture's
impact
statements
show
that
this
plan
of
respondents
would
cost
farmers
far
more
than
it
would
save
consumers...
a
difference
of
several
hundred
million
dollars
of
savings
to
consumers,
on
the
one
hand,
and
a
loss
in
farmers'
income
on
the
other.
it's
not
very
likely
that
farmers
or
their
representatives
in
congress
would
allow
that
to
happen.
it's
almost
certain
that
farmers
would
press
for
an
increase
in
the
price
support
program
that
would
wipe
out
any
savings
to
consumers
by
raising
the
prices
that
they
have
to
pay
for
manufactured
dairy
products.
respondents
also
ignore
the
fact
that
even
now
with
these
supposedly
prohibitive
federal
regulations
in
place,
seven
states
completely
ban
the
sale
of
reconstituted
milk,
and
another
eight
or
nine
place
various
restrictions
on
it.
if
the
federal
regulations
were
changed,
it's
a
likely
assumption
that
more
states
would
pass
similar
legislation
to
protect
their
local
dairy
industries.
so,
in
sum,
on
the
redressability
issue,
we
think
this
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
warth
v.
seldin
and
simon
v.
eastern
kentucky
welfare
rights
organization.
in
both
cases
it
was
entirely
speculative
whether
there
was
any
substantial
probability
that
granting...
that
having
a
court
hear
the
complaint
respondents
had
brought
to
court
would
actually
result
in
the
relief
that
they
want,
which
is
lower
retail
prices
at
the
consumer
level.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
your
honor,
as
i
understand
respondents'
argument,
their
injury
is
that
the
product
they
want
to
buy
is
not
available;
and
i
would
simply
like
to
repeat
that
it
is
available.
they
can
make
it
at
home,
and
they've
been
able
to
make
it
at
home
for
at
least
the
past
20
years.
second,
respondents
repeatedly
say
that
in
order
to
bring
themselves
within
the
statute
zone
of
interest
that
the
statute
has
a
purpose--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
not
probably
to
your
problem.
but
since
their
interest
is
lower
prices
and
they
could
save
more
money
by
making
it
at
home,
i
think
it
is
an
adequate
answer
to
say
that
if
they're
really
serious
about
saving
money,
the
way
to
do
it
is
to
make
this
product
at
home.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
you
can
do
it
any
number
of
ways.
i've
experimented
the
last
several
days
at
home.
you
can
take
milk
powder
and
water
and
just
mix
them
together
in
equal
proportions,
and
you
wind
up
with
a
product
that
resembles
skim
milk.
or
if
you
like
some
butterfat
in
your
milk,
you
can
take
milk
powder
and
water
and
add
in
some
fresh
milk,
which
is
something
that
a
manufacturer
also
does,
and
you
wind
up
with
a
product
that
resembles
2
percent
milk.
and
much
to
my
surprise,
the
federal
register
is
correct.
this
product
is
basically
indistinguishable
from
fresh
fluid
milk
that
you
would
buy
in
a
store.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
what
i
meant.
it
was
indistinguishable.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
come
from
wisconsin,
so
i'm
a
big
milk
drinker.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
since
i
wasn't
in
the
war,
i
can't
answer
that
question.
[laughter]
i
would
say
that
the
technology
for
making
powdered
milk
has
substantially
improved
over
about
the
last
10
to
15
years,
and
it
probably
is
different
than
the
milk
that
they
had
in
the
war.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there
was
one
serious
point
that
i
wanted
to
make,
and
that
was
that
respondents
repeatedly
assert
that
the
statute
has
as
an
interest
setting
up
a
fair
and
balanced
relationship
that
benefits
them.
we
don't
find
that
interest
in
the
statute
anywhere.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
raise
producer
prices.
congress
has
told
the
secretary
exactly
the
level
to
which
he
is
to
raise
producer
prices.
that's
the
parity
level.
respondents
don't
contend
that
the
secretary
has
exceeded
that
level.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
respondents
are
asking
the
courts
to
define
this
fair
and
balanced
relationship
between
producers
and
consumers
when
congress
itself
has
already
said
that
the
relationship
it
wants
to
promote
is
increased
farm
prices,
and
it
had
not
the
slightest
interest
in
lowering
consumer
prices.
the
only
protection
for
consumers
was
to
make
sure
that
they
were
not
subject
to
excessive
price
increases,
which
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
or
to
prices
above
the
parity
level,
which
also
are
not
at
interest
in
this
case.
thank
you.
