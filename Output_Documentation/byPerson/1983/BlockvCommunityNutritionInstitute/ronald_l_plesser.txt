mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
three
cost-conscious
consumers
of
milk
from
tampa
bay,
central
arkansas
and
texas
are
seeking
to
challenge
regulations
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
which
effectively
prohibit
the
sale
to
them
of
reconstituted
milk...
a
lower
cost
alternative
to
fresh
fluid
milk.
the
government
in
their
argument
continued
to
misstate,
i
think,
the
interest
of
consumers
in
this
case.
i
believe
counsel
said
that
we
are
challenging
the
minimal...
minimum
price
level
that
handlers
must
pay
to
producers
for
fresh
fluid
milk.
that
is
not
at
all
the
claim
of
consumers
in
this
case.
the
claim
of
consumers
in
this
case
is
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
issued
a
set
of
regulations
which
prohibit
the
marketing
of
an
alternative
product
in
contravention
of
the
regulation,
of
the
statute
which
is
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act.
we
are
not
challenging
price
levels;
we
are
challenging
whether
or
not
a
competitive
product
should
be
able
to
be
marketed.
there
is
only
one
issue
in
this
case
at
this
point.
the
government
is
arguing
a
good
deal
of
the
merits,
but
the
real
issue
at
this
point
is
whether
or
not
these
three
consumers
have
access
to
the
courts
to
challenge
certain
milk
market
regulations
by
the
secretary.
the
consumers'
claims
are
asserted
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
persons
aggrieved
by
regulations
under
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act.
the
government
contends
that
they
are
precluded
by
inference
and
that
they
lack
the
required
elements
of
standing.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
won't
go
into
the
detail
that
ms.
oberly
did,
but
i
think
a
little
discussion
of
the
regulatory
scheme
is
necessary.
the
milk
market
system
is
a
regulatory
program
that
is
essentially
a
price-fixing
scheme
to
set
minimum
prices
that
producers
receive
from
handlers
for
milk.
producers
are
the
primary
beneficiaries
of
this
legislation.
and
we
readily
agree
to
that.
they
are
not,
however,
regulated.
they
are
the
beneficiaries
of
the
regulation,
but
are
not
certainly
principally
regulated.
the
handlers
are
the
regulated
parties.
they
are
the
parties
to
whom
it
is
determined
how
much
they
will
pay
for
a
product
that
they
then
have
to
sell.
the
consumers--
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
--well,
there
are
some...
there
are
some
restrictions,
i
think.
there
are
some
restrictions
on
producers.
but,
for
example,
if
a
producer
is
also
a
handler,
that
producer
is
outside
of
the
regulations
and
can
really...
and
can
market
milk
outside
of
the
marketing
order.
and
there
is
far
less
control
on
the
producers
than
there
is
on
the...
on
the
handlers.
and
finally,
the
consumers
are
the
beneficiary
of
a
fair
and
balanced
system.
i
think
it
is
just
common
sense
that
consumers
were
the...
are
the
ultimate
beneficiary
of
a
system
that
requires
milk
supply
to...
to
this
country.
i
think
more
importantly,
consumers
are
the
people
who
pay
the
price.
and
it
is...
it
is
in
that
interest
that
these
consumers
come
forward.
consumers
first
sought
relief
by
going
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
this
case
by
filing
a
petition
for
rulemaking.
this
petition
was
supported
by
consumers
but
was
also
supported
by
the
council
on
wage
and
price
stability,
was
also
supported
by
the
department
of
justice
antitrust
division,
and
indeed,
in
the
u.s....
the
u.s.d.a.
itself
filed
an
impact
statement,
which
we
will
discuss
and
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
which
goes
against
consumers
on
the
merits,
but
very
clearly
indicates
that
consumers
will
be...
would
be
favorably
affected
if
their
relief
was
sought.
there
is...
i
say
it
at
this
point
in
the
record...
there
is
simply
every
piece
of
evidence
in
this
rulemaking
record
that
was
initiated
just
prior
to
this
case,
and
every
statement
of
the
government
and
every
report
cited
indicates
and
assumes
that
consumers
will
be
benefited
if
these
regulations
are
eliminated.
the
government
has
argued
here
even
more
strongly
than
they've
argued
in
their
brief
that
we
haven't
shown
any
evidence
that
relief
will
be...
will
be
realized
by
our
plaintiffs.
but
i
think
the
plain
truth
is
there
is
not
one
study,
not
one
statement
that
the
government
can
present
other
than
in
argument
to
indicate
that
consumers
will
not
have
the
benefit.
in
fact,
the
united
states
department--
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what...
on
the
merits
of
this
case
what
we
hope
is
that
essentially
the...
the
reconstituted
milk
process
will
be
taken
out
of
part
of
the
regulation
and
will
be
treated
as
a
milk
product
rather
than
milk
so
that
its
price
will
be
able
to
float
in
the
marketplace
and
not
necessarily
be
regulated.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
well,
i
think
the
test
was
enunciated
in
the
earth
v.
seldin
which
indicated
that
you
could...
that
the
court
could
take
the
allegations,
but
if
those
allegations
were
challenged
by
the
government,
that
it
then...
then
the
plaintiffs
had
a
requirement
to
substantiate
those...
those
allegations.
so
i
don't
think
i
can
just
sit
here
and
say
allegations
are
enough
to
get
us
past
the
barrier
of...
of
injury
in
fact
and
redressability.
but
i
think
the...
what
we've
produced
in
the
record,
which
by
the
way
is
primarily
material
developed
by
governmental
agencies
in
this
case,
indicate
that
we
have...
we
have
met
the
threshold
requirement
for
injury
in
fact,
redressability.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
oh,
i
would
certainly
stop
short.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
indicated
that
if
you
have
a
full
dress
trial
on
the
issues
of
standing,
essentially
you're
litigating
the
issues
of
merits
at
the
standing
level.
and
at
least
judge
wilkie
in
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
that
was
inappropriate,
but
did
feel
that
there
was
a
need
for
this
threshold
of
some
facts.
and
we're
certainly
not
just
standing
on
the
bare
allegations
in
our
complaint.
we
were
turned
down...
consumers
were
turned
down
in
their
petition
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
and
i
think
it's
important
to,
as
i
go
into
the
injury
and
preclusion
issues,
to...
to
just
review
the
three
basic
requirements
for
this
kind
of
case
were
set
down
in
associated
data
processing
and
barlow
v.
collins.
and
those
three
requirements
are
that
injury
in
fact
by
the
government
agency,
that
the
interests
asserted
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
a
substantive
statute,
and
that
the
statute
cannot
explicitly
or
implicitly
preclude
judicial
review.
as
i've
already
stated,
of
course,
we
don't
have
to
demonstrate
merits.
we
just
have
to
demonstrate
sufficient
facts
to
get
past
the
threshold
of
standing.
the
injury
being
suffered
by
these
consumers
is
distinct,
palpable
and
is
personal
to
them.
the
government
has
argued
as
though
we
are
representing
consumers
from
all
over
the
country
and
that
it
is
89
cents
per
capita
per
year,
or
what
we
are
arguing
is
for
three
particular
consumers
in
regions
of
the
country,
where
the
secretary's
own
impact
statement
indicated
that
they
would
be
benefited
if
reconstituted
milk
was
made
available.
these
are
in
regions
which
are
typically
referred
to
as
inefficient
milk
market
regions.
it
may
be
that
in
the
more
efficient
regions
consumers
would
not
be
able
to
demonstrate
the
injury
that
our
clients
can
demonstrate
in
this
case.
we
are
not
representing
all
consumers
in
the
united
states.
we
are
representing
three
consumers
who
are
located
in
three
specific
market
areas,
and
we've
demonstrated
facts
in
our
case...
in
our
papers
sufficient
to
indicate
an
injury
to
them
if...
an
injury
to
them
by
the
failure
of
the
secretary
to
allow
the
marketing
of
reconstituted
milk.
it
is...
it
has
not
been
contested
that
the
effect
of
the
regulation
is
to
prohibit
reconstituted
milk.
as
we've
demonstrated
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
in
the
regions
in
which
our...
our
clients
are
situate,
the
cost
of
reconstituted
milk
at
the
wholesale
level
exceeds
that
of
regular
fresh
milk.
and
i
think
it
is...
it's
not
contested
also
that
the
same
price...
and
we
don't
contest
it...
at
the
same
price
or
higher
price
that
consumers
would
buy
reconstituted
milk.
they
would
only
buy
it
if
it
was
at
a
cost
savings.
and
in
those
three
areas
not
only
does
the
regulations
of
the
secretary
make
them
equal
price,
but
in
fact,
reconstituted
milk
is
more
expensive.
and
that's
not
been
contested
at
any
point
by
the
government.
and
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
focus
both
on
the
secretary
of
agriculture's
impact
statement
that
indicated
that
consumers
would
be
damaged
to
the
extent
of
$186
million
a
year,
or
in
other
words,
they
would
receive
a
benefit
of
$186
million
a
year.
and
we
contend
that
for
purposes
of
standing
that
that
is
a
salient
factor.
the
fact
that,
as
judge
gash
at
the
district
level
thought
there
was
some
countervailing
concerns
that
farmers
would
be
injured
and
then
resultingly
affect
consumers,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
handled
that
appropriately
and
said
that
that
was...
that
was
essentially
conjecture
that
could
be
resolved
on
the
merits,
but
that
there
was
no
substantiation
of
that
at
this
point.
but
for
merits
discussion
there
was
$184
million.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
well,
as
we...
we
state
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
we
believe
the
interest
of
consumers
is
in
a
fair
and
balanced
price.
as
i
stated
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
we
are
not
contending
that
we
want
cheaper
prices.
we
simply
want
a
fair
and
balanced
approach.
and
we
think
we
will
be
able
to
demonstrate--
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
what
we
have
to
argue
or
we
have
to
contend
is
that
if
we
prevail
on
the
merits
and
we...
it's
determined
that
the
secretary's
regulations
create
an
illegal
trade
barrier
to
reconstituted
milk
and
that
reconstituted
milk
is
effectively
classified
as
fluid
milk
in
contravention
of
the
statute,
then
reconstituted
milk
will
have
to
be
made
available,
and
we
will
benefit.
it's
not
necessarily
that
we're
asking
for
a
lower
price.
we're
simply
asking
for
a
product
essentially
to
be
released
from
what
we
think
is
an
illegal
regulatory
scheme.
we're
asking
for
this
product
to
be
broken
out.
if
that
product
is
broken
out,
we
will
benefit
by
more...
more...
by
cheaper
prices.
but
we
don't
think
congress
intended
in
that
statute
to
allow
the
secretary
to
create
trade
barriers
or
to
classify
products
as
milk
to
the
detriment
of...
of
consumers.
so
while
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
that
our...
that
our
concerns
are...
it's
very
confusing
and
it's
very
close,
but
i
think
we're...
we're
more
interested
in
getting
that
product
available
rather
than
arguing
the
price.
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
there's
an
interest
in...
in
this
fair
and
balanced
price,
and
there's
no
interest
in
illegally...
in
illegal
price
structures.
getting
to
the
second
part
of
the
associated
data
processing
test
i
think
is
responsive
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
which
is
essentially
the...
the
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
test
that's
been
asserted
by
this
court.
we
turn
to
two
sections
of
the
agriculture
marketing
agreement
act,
section
22
and
section
24,
both
of
which
on
the
face
of
those
sections
indicate
an
interest
to
protect
consumers,
and
that
the
consumer
has
an
interest,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
in
fair
prices
and
in
an
appropriate
administration
of
the
act
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act.
again,
the
interest
is
not
just
in
lower
prices,
but
in
a
fair
and
balanced
program.
clearly,
the
rights
of
consumers
are
intended
to
be
protected
from
the
face
of
the
statute.
to
require
more,
we
believe
at
this...
at
this
juncture
would
return
to
the
legal
interest
tests
that
were
turned
over
in
associated
data
processing.
clearly,
as
the...
as
judge
wilkie
recognized
in
this
case,
consumers
have
a
stake
in
the
outcome
of...
of
orders
under
the
milk
market
agreement
act,
and
that
they
have
an
interest
to
assure
compliance
with
the
secretary
with
the
challenge
of
the
act.
the
government
has
said
in
their
briefs
that
we
are
challenging
the
basis
of
the
act.
we
are
not.
we
are
simply
challenging
the
legality
of
whether...
of
certain
regulatory
schemes
under
the
act
as
adopted
by
the
secretary.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
discussed
it
in
great
detail.
and
i
think
that
following
the
cases
that
i
reviewed
from
this
court,
it
appears
that...
that
administrative...
that
the
zone
of
interest
test
is
still
a...
is
still
a
strong
holding,
although
there
are
some
commentators
that
disagree.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
as
i
said,
your
honor,
i
think...
and
as
judge
wilkie
has
indicated
in
his
court
of
appeals
decision...
there
are
two
sections,
sections
in
the
act
which
talk
about
the
interests
of
consumers.
the
legislative
history
that
we
cited
talks
about
the
interests
of
consumers
in
a
fair
and
balanced...
in
a
fair
and
balanced
system.
and
i
think
there
is
a
threshold
of
interest
of
consumers
in
how
that
regulatory
structure
is
created.
so
that
i
think
the
zone
of
interest
being
an
expansive
test
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
i
think--
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
--i
think
on
zone
of
interest,
your
honor,
that
it
would
go
to
consumers
who
were
asserting
the
type
of
injury
that
we
are
asserting
in
terms
of
the
access
to
reconstituted
milk.
conceivably
there
could
be
consumers
or
other
people
who
would
be
injured
but
not
within
the
zone
of
interest.
for
example,
a
manufacturer
or
reconstituted
milk
equipment
or
a
trucker
of
milk
powder
is
injured
by
these
regulations.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
that
such
a...
such
a
person
would
be
within
the
zone
of
interest.
but
these
consumers
are.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
yes.
if
they
assert
the
type
of
claims
we
do.
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
your
honor,
i
can
really
only
speak--
mr.
ronald
l.
plesser
--your
honor,
as
i...
as
i
stated,
i
think
you
are...
i
assume...
i
will
take
judicial
notice
that
you're
all
consumers
of
milk,
but
i
think
that...
i
think
that
what
we're
arguing
here
is
what
area
of
the
country,
what
would
the
impact
on
those
milk
market
orders
are.
we've
done
the
analysis
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
i
do
not
know
if
there
would
be
the
kind
of
impact
in
this
area
that...
that
would...
that
we've
done
for
our
consumers
in
the
tampa
bay,
arkansas
and
texas
area,
that
would...
would
justify
consumers.
i
think...
but
i
think
what
you're
getting
at
is
the
generalized
grievance
argument,
justice
marshall.
and
i
think
that...
i
think
that
judge...
judge
wilkie
had
a
good
response
to
that,
which
is
if
we
can
demonstrate
that
our...
that
there
is
a
distinct
and
palpable
injury,
my
clients
cannot
go
to
a
supermarket
and
find
reconstituted
milk
on
the
shelf,
and
studies
indicate
that
but
for
these
regulations
there's
a
substantial
probability
that
that
product
would
be
there.
we
can't
find
it
on
the
shelf.
that's
a
real
injury.
that's
a
real
loss.
we
then
have...
i
think
we
then
can
demonstrate
that
we
are
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
statute
for
a
fair
and
balanced
program,
and
that
is,
i
think,
the
basis
of
our
claim.
the
fact
that
many
other
consumers
are
like
situate
i
don't
think
lessens
the
impact
or
the
rights
of
our
clients
to
seek
redress.
finally
is
the
preclusion
argument
that
we
have
recognized
and
which
the
government
relies
on
quite
strongly,
and
i
think
the
preclusion
argument
of
the
government
is
really
very
simple.
it
says
that
anybody...
since
handlers
were
given
specific
remedial
rights
under
the
statute,
that
no
one
else
should
be
able
to
challenge
the
statute.
nonhandlers
are
excluded.
of
course,
that
argument
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
1944
in
stark
v.
wickard,
where
it
was
determined
that
producers,
although
not
given
specific
administrative
and
judicial
rights,
were
allowed
standing.
the
government
has
argued
well,
producers
really
is
a
different
situation
because
they
are
more
affected
by
the
statute,
they're
more
recognized
as
the
principal
beneficiary,
none
of
which
we...
we
contest
or
argue
with.
our
claim
simply...
and
our
position
is
very
straightforward.
for
the
position...
for
an
argument
of
preclusion,
if
nonhandlers
are
to
be
precluded
and
if
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
preclude
nonhandlers,
then
producers
and
consumers
are
indistinguishable
for
that
purpose.
they
may
be
on
much
different
grounds
for
standing
arguments,
for
injury
in
fact
and
redressability,
but
on
a
straight
preclusion
concept
addressed
by
the
government
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
it's
inconsistent.
and
the...
the
harms
that
they
asserted
were
the
same
harms
that
they...
exactly
the
same
harms
that
they
asserted
in
1944
when
they
argued
stark
v.
wickard.
we've
looked
at
the
briefs
in
that
case,
and
the
supreme
court,
this
court
in
stark
v.
wickard
responded
to
that
argument,
as
we
quote
in
our
material,
and
suggested
that...
that
those
types
of
arguments
of
the
delicate
balance
and
the
excessive
litigation
would
be
solved
by
motions
to
dismiss
and
other
activities
that
limit
frivolous
actions,
as
well
as
the
cost
of
brining
the
action.
and
i...
i
think
that...
that
this
court
in
responding
in
1944
to
those
exact
same
concerns
can
raise
the
same...
the
same
responses
are
valid
today;
that...
that
there
is
no
great
fear
that...
that
consumers
are
going
to
overburden
the
courts.
i
think
if
consumers
can
come
forward
and
show
the
kind
of
injury
we've
showed
in
this
case
and
show...
demonstrate
the
type
of
violation
that
they...
that
we
are
attempting
to
demonstrate
in
this
case,
that
they
should
be
able
to...
to
respond...
to
have
standing.
there
is
just
two
points
i'd
like
to
say
before
i
conclude.
one,
counsel
for
the
government
has
indicated...
used
two
examples,
the
state
of
california
and
the
state...
and
north
carolina
to
indicate
why
there
really
isn't
any
interest
in
marketing
reconstituted
milk.
my
response
to
north
carolina
is
the
reason...
and
it's
in
the
record,
i
think
in
the
impact
statement
of
the
secretary...
the
reason
that
the...
that
the...
the
handler
in
north
carolina
stopped
making
reconstituted
milk,
which
was
relatively
successful...
it
wasn't
overwhelming,
but
they
were
selling
a
fair
amount
of
it...
was
because
the
handler
was
bought
by
a
co-op.
the
co-op
is
a
milk
producer,
and
i
suggest
that
it
was
not
in
the
interest
of
the
co-op
after
they
purchased
this
handler
to
continue
the
reconstituted
milk
product,
and
that's
why
the
north
carolina
experience,
which
was
a
truly
deregulated
situation,
did
not...
did
not
result
in...
why
that
ended.
in
california
it
is
true
that
california
is
not
regulated
under
the
federal
milk
market
order,
but
california
is
regulated
by
a
state
of
california
milk
market
system
very
similar
to
that
of
the
federal
program.
and
while
i
can't
say
with
absolute
certainty
because
it
wasn't
discussed
in
the
brief,
i
am
comfortable
in
asserting
that
the
same
type
of
restrictions
that
were
existent
in
this
case
were
existent
in
the
california
system.
so
while
federal
law
didn't
stop
them,
state
law
did.
and
finally,
in
terms
of
the
restrictions
on
reconstituted
milk,
reconstituted
milk
is
not
milk.
it
is
another
product.
it
has
to
be
labeled
separately,
as
most
states
have
required,
and
in
some
states,
i
suspect
in...
in
response
to
dairy
interests,
it
is
even...
it
is
even
prohibited
from
being
marketed,
i
assume
primarily
for
economic
reasons.
it
is
a
product
that
will
benefit
consumers,
and
we
believe...
we
contend
that
the
government...
that
consumers
have
asserted
sufficient
interest
for
standing.
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i'm
complete.
thank
you.
