mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
import-export
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
ohio's
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
which
applies
to
all
goods
used
in
business
within
ohio
regardless
of
their
origin.
this
case
presents
two
issues
to
the
court,
both
of
which
involve
the
scope
of
this
court's
1976
decision
in
michelin
tire
corporation
v.
wages.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
ohio
supreme
court
properly
applied
and
interpreted
this
court's
decision
in
michelin
in
its
holding
that
the
tax
commissioner
was
collaterally
estopped
by
this
court's
1945
decision
in
hooven
&
allison
company
v.
evatt
from
imposing
its
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
hooven
&
allison's
imported
raw
materials
which
were
no
longer
in
transit
or
retained
in
their
original
packages
and
were
held
for
use
in
manufacturing
in
ohio.
inherent
in
this
issue
is
whether
the
original
package
doctrine
upon
which
hooven
was
based
retains
any
validity
with
respect
to
import-export
clause
cases
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
michelin.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
the
state...
the
ohio
supreme
court
accepted
this
court's
limitation
on
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
enunciated
in
commissioner
v.
sunnen,
but
found
that
that
limitation
being
that
collateral
estoppel
is
inapplicable
where
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court
has
changed
the
legal
principles
upon
which
the
prior
decision
was
based.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
the
court
was
applying
federal
law
on
the
issue.
i
believe
it
was
required
to
apply
federal
law--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--because
it
was
basing
its
decision
on
a
decision
of
this
court.
the
second
issue--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
stevens,
i
believe
it's
inherent
in
the
basic
power
of
a
court
that
it
must
determine
the
scope
of
its
own
judgment.
the
judgment
upon
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
based
its
collateral
estopped
decision
was
hooven
&
allison
v.
evatt,
which
was
a
decision
of
this
court
which
dealt
solely
with
the
federal
constitutional
issue;
that
is,
the
immunity
provided
by
the
import-export
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
believe
this
court
has
on
at
least
two
occasions
determined
that
where
collateral
estopped
is
based
upon
a
federal
decision
that
the
effect
of
that
decision
is
a
federal
question
reviewable
by
this
court.
the
second
issue--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--those...
those
cases...
and
i
apologize;
they
were
not
cited
in
the
brief,
because
i
was
not
aware
of
them
at
the
time...
are
deposit
bank
v.
frankfurt
at
191
u.s.
499,
and
stahl
v.
gottlieb,
305
u.s.
at
165.
i
think
this
principle
is
consistent
with
the
restatement
of
judgments
at
section
87
which
in
effect
carries
out
the--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--certainly,
mr.
justice
brennan.
my
position
is
that
those
cases
state
that
where
a
federal
judge...
whether
a
federal
judgment
has
been
given
due
effect
is
a
decision
for
this
court
to
make.
it's
a
federal
question
and
not
a
question
for
the
state
court
to
decide.
i
believe
they
point
out
that
it's
a
fundamental
concept
that
a
court
must
determine
the
scope
and
effect
of
its
own
judgment.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
what
those
cases
and
what
the
fundamental
principle
require
is
that
where
a...
where
collateral
estoppel
is
to
be
applied
based
on
a
decision
of
this
court,
that
this
court
must
determine
the
scope
and
effect
of
that
decision.
if
we're
to
allow
a
state
court
to
determine
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
without
review
by
this
court,
we
would
be
left
with
the
result
that
each
of
the
50
states
might
come
up
with
a
different
interpretation
of
this
court--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
in
order
to
assure
that
the
state
court
properly
applies
an
earlier
decision
of
this
court,
particularly
where
there's
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--is
a
decision
that
this
court
must
make.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
apologize
if
i
confused
the
issue
earlier,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
correct.
however,
if
you
do
not
apply
the
concept
to
decisions
which
collaterally
estop
a
party
based
or
a
decision
of
this
court,
this
court
will
never
be
able
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
application
of
the
earlier
decision
by
the
lower...
by
the
state
court
was
proper.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
thank
you.
the
second
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
a
broader
one;
that
is,
whether
ohio
can
impose
its
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
imported
raw
materials
which
are
retained
in
their
original
packages,
are
no
longer
in
transit,
and
are
held
for
use
in
manufacturing
within
the
state
of
ohio
within
the
strictures
of
the
import-export
clause.
the
tax
commissioner
has
two
contentions
in
this
case.
initially,
the
tax
commissioner
contends
that
michelin
effected
a
change
in
the
legal
principles
upon
which
hooven
&
allison
v.
evatt
was
based,
thereby
rendering
collateral
estoppel
inapplicable
under
the
limitations
enunciated
in
this
court's
decision
in
commissioner
v.
sunnen.
the
second
contention
of
the
tax
commissioner
is
that
michelin's
holding
that
a
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
property
tax
imposed
on
imported
goods
no
longer
in
transit
is
not
an
impost
or
a
duty,
and
therefore
is
not
prohibited
by
the
import-export
clause,
is
controlling
with
respect
to
the
assessment
at
issue.
the
holdings
below
by
both
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals
and
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
were
that
the
commissioner
was
collaterally
estopped
by
this
court's
decision
in
sunnen
from
imposing
its
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax.
the
board's
decision
reveals
no
discussion
whatsoever
of
the
effect
of
sunnen
or
of
this
court's
decision
in
michelin.
while
the
ohio
supreme
court
does
accept
the
limitation
enunciated
in
sunnen,
it
specifically
found
that
this
court's
decision
in
michelin
neither
implicitly
overruled
nor
effected
a
change
in
the
legal
principles
upon
which
hooven
was
based.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
rehnquist,
there
were
decisions
initially
by
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals.
it's...
it's
a...
or
it's
a
review
board
which
hears
appeals
from
determinations
of
the
tax
commissioner.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
it
ruled
that
the
tax
commissioner
was
estopped
from
assessing
its
tax
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
hooven.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
and
it
was
also
the
position
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
that
that
was
the
decision
that
estopped
the
commissioner
from
issuing
the
assessment.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
rather
simple.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
correct,
justice.
the
facts
are
rather
simple
in
this
case.
hooven
&
allison
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
cordage.
in
this
manufacturing
operation
it
uses
raw
materials
that
are
imported
from
various
foreign
countries.
they
are
shipped
by
ocean-going
vessels
to
u.s.
ports
and
then
transported
by
rail
to
hooven
&
allison's
ohio
plant.
after
they
are
received
at
the
ohio
plant,
they
are
stored
in
their
original
packages
in
that
plant
until
they
are
used
in
the
manufacturing
process;
that
also
takes
place
in
that
same
plant.
for
tax
years
1976
and
1977,
the
tax
commissioner,
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
michelin,
issued
an
assessment
against
hooven
&
allison
which
had
the
effect
of
including
within
its
taxable
property
the
imported
raw
material
retained
in
the
original
packages.
the
tax
commissioner
does
not
dispute
that
the
nature
of
the
goods
and
the
nature
of
the
tax
at
issue
in
the
present
case
are
the
same
as
those
involved
in
the
decision
in
this
court
or
by
this
court
in
hooven
&
allison
v.
evatt.
the
tax
commissioner
will
first
argue
that
michelin
effected
a
change
in
the
legal
principles
upon
which
hooven
was
based,
thereby
rendering
collateral
estoppel
inapplicable,
and
then
will
argue
that
the
holding
in
michelin
requires
a
finding
that
ohio's
tax
is
valid
under
the
import-export
clause.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
blackmun,
it
did
not
expressly
overrule
hooven.
i
would
submit
that
it
implicitly
overruled
hooven,
because
hooven
was
based
on
the
original
package
doctrine
that
was
formalized
by
the
court
in
the
low
v.
austin
decision.
a
review
of
both
decisions
reveals
that
the
identical
portions
of
brown
v.
maryland
and
the
license
cases
were
relied
on
by
the
court
in
low
and
by
the
court
in
hooven.
those
were
the
provisions
that
this
court
in
the
michelin
decision
specifically
found
that
low
had
misread.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
blackmun,
i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
decide
the
issue
here.
while
this
court's
decision
on
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
would
resolve
the
specific
issue
determined
by
the
court
below,
i
believe
this
case
presents
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
this
court
to
dispel
any
questions
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
its
decision
in
michelin.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
feel
confident
that
our
court,
in
light
of
such
a
decision,
would
have
upheld
the
imposition
of
ohio's
tax.
but--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
white,
i
think
it's
clear
that
if
this
court
had
specifically
overruled
hooven,
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
would
not
have
applied
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
white,
i
believe
our
court
should
have
read
the
decision
in
michelin
and
looked
at
the...
the
basic
principles
that
were
adopted
in
that
decision.
michelin
adopted
a
fundamentally
different
approach
to
import-export
clause
cases.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
sunnen,
it
clearly
affected
it.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr....
or
justice
white,
i
think
it
may
have
done
so.
and
in
a
reading
of
the
court's
decision
below,
there
are
alternative...
there
is
alternative
language
in
that
decision
which
i
think
leaves
it
unclear
as
to
exactly
what
it
would
do.
it
accepted
the
principle
of
sunnen
that
a
change
in
a
legal
principles
renders
the
doctrine
inapplicable--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--but
then
it
also
quoted
some
language
from
a
lower
court
decision
in
the
penfield
case,
indicating
that
it
was
not
within
the
province
of
a
lower
court
to
guess
at
what
this
court
might
do.
i
think
in
light
of
the
nature
of
this...
this
court's
decision
in
michelin
that
that
particular
language
quoted
by
the
court
was
in
applicable.
it's
the
tax
commissioner's
position
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
michelin
so
clearly
controls
this
case
that--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
white,
i
think
it
would...
it
would
have
depended
on
the
language
that
this
court
used
in...
in...
in--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--if
that
were
the
only
difference
in
the
michelin
case,
it
would
still
be
the
tax
commissioner's
position
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
should
have
refused
to
apply
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
as
a
matter
of...
justice
white,
i
think
it's
more
a
matter
of
applying
the
decision
of
this
court
in
commissioner
v.
sunnen
and
determining
whether
or
not
michelin
v.
wages
changed
or
effected
a
growth
or
modification
in
the
legal
principles.
by
applying
collateral
estoppel,
the
court
of
appeals...
or
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
not
even
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
problem.
sunnen
doesn't
say
that
simply
because
there's
a
growth
in
the
legal
principles
that
you
have
to
find
against
the
party
relying
on
collateral
estoppel
on
the
merits.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
if
the
court
specifically
stated
that
hooven
was
not
overruled
and
simply
didn't
say
that
we
don't
reach
the
question,
i
believe
that
the
lower
court
would
properly
have
applied
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that...
i
believe
the
issues
are
interrelated.
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
collateral
estoppel
was
properly
applied,
i
believe
the
court
has
to
determine,
as
it
did
in
sunnen,
whether
or
not
the
principles
upon
which
the
earlier
case...
and
in
this
case
because
they
were
constitutional
issues...
it
has
to
be
determined
whether
those
constitutional
issues
have
remained
unmodified
or
unchanged.
in
this
case
i'd
argue
they've...
they've...
the
constitutional
principle
was
specifically
repudiated,
and
it's
a
much
stronger
case
for
the
application
of
the
limitation
in
sunnen.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
white,
i
believe
that
that
would
resolve
the
case.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
and
i
believe
if
that
was--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--i...
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
justice
white.
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
sure
if
this
court
said
it
were
overruled,
the
ohio
supreme
court
would...
would
no
longer
upon
remand
attempt
to
apply
collateral
estoppel.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
blackmun,
i
believe
if
this
court
held
that
hooven
was
overruled
that
it
would,
in
effect,
decide
the
constitutional
issue,
because
by
overruling
hooven
it
would
have
specifically
answered
the
second
issue
we
present;
that
is,
whether
ohio's
tax
can
be
constitutionally
applied
to
imported
raw
materials,
as
well
as
imported
goods
held
for
resale,
regardless
of
whether
those
goods
were
retained
in
their
original
package.
i...
it's...
i
would...
the
respondent
has
raised
issues
in
his
brief
regarding
the
commerce
clause
and
the
import-export
clause
and
its
effect
on
the
validity
of
the
tax
at
issue.
these
issues
were
not
raised
in
any
notice
of
appeal
within
this
process,
nor
was
a
cross-petition
raising
these
issues
filed
by
the
respondent.
i
would
submit
that
those
issues
are
not
properly
before
this
case,
having
simply
been
argued
by
the
respondent
in
the
briefs
filed
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
they...
these...
the...
at
the
ohio
supreme
court
these
matters
were
argued
in
the
briefs.
i
would
suggest,
though,
under
the
ohio
scheme
of
appeals
regarding
tax
cases,
the
issue
was
not
properly
raised.
in
the
ohio
statutes
in
order
to
raise
an
issue
on
appeal,
that
particular
issue
must
be
specified
in
the
notice
of
appeal
unlike--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--mr....
or
justice
brennan,
i
don't
believe
that...
or
i
do
believe
that
the
ohio...
that
the
failure
to
follow
ohio
provisions
with
respect
to
raising
those
issues
would
preclude
him
raising
those
issues
before
this
court,
even
though
i
admit
that
those
issues
were
specifically
argued
in
the
briefs
in
this
matter
and
in
oral
argument
before
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
i
believe
this
court
has
that
authority,
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
they
were
not
properly
before
the
ohio
supreme
court,
justice
white,
because
they
were
not
specified
in
the
notice
of
appeal
to
that
court.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
it
was
the
appellant
and
cross-appellee,
justice
rehnquist.
the
board
of
tax
appeals
decided
the
collateral
estoppel
issue,
refused
to
consider
the
constitutional
issues.
hooven
&
allison
appealed
the
refusal
of
that
board
to
resolve
the
constitutional
issues
that
it
had
raised
before
the
court.
we
appealed
the
board's
decision
on
the
collateral
estoppel
issue.
therefore,
we
were
both
appealing
from
the
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals.
the...
the
notice
of
appeal
did
raise
one
issue,
i
should
clarify,
with
respect
to
the
foreign
commerce
clause
and
the
import-export
clause,
and
that
was
the
argument
by
hooven
&
allison
that
imposition
of
the
tax
would
impair
the
federal
government's
exclusive
right
to
regulate
foreign
commerce.
the
other
issues...
multiple
taxation,
free
flow
of
goods
among
the
states,
and
the
possibility
that
the
federal
government's
exclusive
right
to
imposts
from
imports
and
duties
would
be
impaired
were
not
raised
in
that
notice
of
appeal.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
respond
to
the
arguments
of
hooven
&
allison
regarding
these
constitutional
issues.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
few
matters
in
rebuttal.
the
tax
commissioner's
position
was
initially
that
collateral
estoppel
did
not
apply
because
the
controlling
legal
principle
upon
which
hooven
was
based
had
been
repudiated
or
at
least
changed
by
this
court's
decision
in
michelin.
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
tax
commissioner
to
present
any
factual
evidence
with
respect
to
that
claim.
the
only
facts
necessary
for
that
determination
are
that
the
same
tax...
the
same
type
of
tax
was
involved...
that
is,
a
state
nondiscriminatory
ad
valorem
property
tax...
and
that
the
imported
goods
upon
which
that
tax
was
attempted
to
be
imposed
were
no
longer
in
transit.
michelin
specifically
held
that
such
attacks
on
those
goods
is
not
an
impost
or
a
duty.
if
it's
not
an
impost
or
a
duty,
it
was
not
immune,
or
it
was
not
prohibited
by
the
import-export
clause.
the
respondent's
attempt
to
put
some
burden
on
the
commissioner
to
prove
its
case
is,
i
think,
a
disingenuous
attempt
to
get
this
court
to
ignore
the
clear
ruling
of
the
michelin
decision.
the...
the
respondent
in
this
case
actually
waived
its
right
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
board
and
chose
obviously
to
rely
on
its
collateral
estoppel
attack
and
abandon
any
attempt
to
actually
prove
any
constitutional
violation
by
the
imposition
of
a
tax
in
the
present
case.
i
would
point
out
with
respect
to
a
couple
of
statements
made
by
the
respondent
regarding
the
notice
of
appeal
and
what
was
raised
by
the
respondent.
as
i
indicated
in
my
opening
argument,
the
respondent
did
raise
in
his
notice
of
appeal
the
commerce
clause
aspect
regarding
the
federal
regulation
of
foreign
commerce.
that
is
the
only
portion
of
the
commerce
clause
that
was
raised
in
the
notice
of
appeal
as
the...
as
the
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
at
page
a-17
of
the
petition
for
cert
appendix
reveals.
with
respect
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
regarding
custom-bonded
warehouses,
i
believe
that
such
warehouses
would
only
protect
imported
goods
from
the
imposition
of
a
state
tax
if
those
goods
are
subsequently
re-engaged
in
foreign
commerce;
that
is,
transported
out...
out
of
the
state.
if
those
goods
are
removed
from
a
custom-bonded
warehouse
to
some
domestic
source,
those
goods
are
subject
to
the
tax
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
those
goods
are
located.
i
think--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--when
removed
from
the
warehouse,
it--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--well,
under
the...
under
the
customs-bonded
warehouse
statutes,
it's
my
understanding
that
as
long
as
they're
put
in
those
warehouses,
they
are
presumed
to
be
intended
for
use
later
in
foreign
commerce.
only
when
they
are
then
removed
are
they
subject
to
tax.
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
justice
white,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--justice
white,
i
don't
think
they
would
have
been
allowed
to
put
their
materials
within
that
warehouse--
mr.
richard
c.
farrin
--if...
if
they
had
stated
they
were
going
to
use
them
in
foreign
commerce.
another
point
that
i
would
make
is
that
the
tax
at
issue
here
is
not
a
tariff,
it's
not
a
duty
on
the
right
to
bring
goods
into
the
country.
it's
a
property
tax
that
is
imposed
on
goods
after
those
goods
have
come
to
rest
within
ohio.
it
merely
is
a
method
by
which
ohio
apportions
to
the
individuals
who
do
business
within
the
state
the
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
the
government
services
provided
to
those
particular
businesses
and
individuals.
in
order
to
allow
an
exemption
for
hooven
&
allison
in
the
present
case
would
require
others
within
the
state
who
are
subject
to
the
tax
to
subsidize
the
cost
of
those
services
provided
to
hooven
&
allison.
that
is
a
requirement
that
michelin
specifically
said
was
not
required
by
the
import-export
clause,
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
allow
the
respondent
in
the
present
case
to
avoid
paying
its
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
the
government
services
that
ohio
provides
to
it
by
paying
a
tax
on
the
goods
that
it
has
in
its
ohio
warehouse
awaiting
its
intended
use
in
business.
thank
you.
