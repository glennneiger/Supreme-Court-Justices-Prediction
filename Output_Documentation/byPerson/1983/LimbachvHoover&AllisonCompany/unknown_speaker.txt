unknown
speaker
mr.
farrin,
did
the
ohio
supreme
court
apply
state
collateral
estoppel
principles
in
finding
the
state
precluded
by
the
hooven
&
allison
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
think
the
court
was
trying
to
apply
federal
preclusion
principles.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
source,
if
i
may
ask
you?
what
is
the
source
of
the
federal
collateral
estoppel
law?
just
is
there...
is
there
sort
of
a
federal
common
law,
is
it,
of
collateral
estoppel
that's
binding
on
the
states?
unknown
speaker
and
what
are
those
cases
you're
just
referring
to?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mind
restating
what
you
say
those
cases
stand
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought...
the
way
you
stated
it
previously,
was
it
the
meaning,
what
the
court
held
in
the
prior
cases
a
federal
question,
not
the...
not
the...
not
the
effect
that
must
be
given
it
in
a
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't
depend
on
collateral
estoppel
or
anything
like
that.
that
would
depend
on...
on...
on
correcting
a
state
court's
view
of
what
this
court
held
in
the
past.
unknown
speaker
right,
right.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
all
right.
that's
a
little
different
wording
of
it
which
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
the
earlier
case
had
been
smith
against
jones
instead
of
involving
hooven
against
allison,
you
still
might
have
a
question
of
what
effect
do
you
give
to
the
decision
of
this
court.
it's
obviously
a
federal
question,
but
it
doesn't
depend
on
any
theory
of
collateral
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying
about
the
holding
of
the
tax...
is
it
the
tax
commissioner
you're
referring
to
or
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
it
ruled
how?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
it's
the
original
hooven
decision
in
the
view
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
that
collaterally
estops
the
commissioner
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
no
one
has
passed
on
the
constitutional
issue
yet?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
michelin
the
court
overruled
low
v.
austin,
but
it
didn't
overrule
hooven.
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
agree
with
you
on
the
collateral
estoppel
issue.
should
we
remand
the
case
for
the
ohio
court
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
issue,
or
should
we
decide
it
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
mr.
attorney
general,
what
would...
what
do
you
suppose
your...
the
state
court
would
have
done
if...
if
in
michelin
we
had
specifically
said
that
not
only
low
but
hooven
is...
are...
is
overruled?
unknown
speaker
even
though...
even
though
it
involved
the
same
party
that
had
had
a
favorable
decision
below...
before.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
in...
let's
assume
that
in...
let's
assume
that
in
michelin
the
court
had
said
we
overrule
low
against
austin,
but
whether
hooven
should
be
overruled
we
save
for
another
day.
then
what?
then
what
should
your
courts
have
done?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
would
have
been
required
to...
to
say
just
what
it
did
at...
at
hooven...
if
hooven
1
is
overruled,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
by
the
supreme
court
since
it
saved
for
itself
that
question
for
another
day?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
but
if
we
had
said
in
michelin
we
put...
we
put
off
to
another
day
the
decision
of
hooven,
whether
hooven
is
overruled,
would
you
think
it
would
be...
that
that...
would
you
be
arguing
that
ohio
was
constitutionally
disentitled
to
apply
collateral
estoppel
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
gave
you
the
language.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so,
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional--
unknown
speaker
--but
in
my
example
it
is...
the
court
says
remember,
fellows,
hooven
isn't
overruled
by
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
collateral
estoppel
and
the
constitutional
issue
are
kind
of
blended
together,
aren't
they,
because
the
sunnen
case
says
if
there's
been
a
change
in
the
law,
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
apply;
and
the
argument
here
is
whether
there's
been
a
change
in
the
law.
unknown
speaker
if
we
just
say
here,
well,
under...
reread
michelin
and
reread
the
old
hooven,
and
we
think
michelin
fatally
wounded
hooven,
hooven
won,
and
so
hooven
is
overruled,
that's
all
we
need
to
say.
then
we
remand,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
we
needn't
say
anything
about
collateral
estoppel
then.
we
just
say--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
that
brings
up
my
question,
which
i
thought
you
answered,
as
to
whether
we
go
ahead
and
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
were
raised
and
argued,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
as
you
know,
a
respondent
may
support
a
judgment
here
on
grounds
raised
and
argued
below.
you
don't
think
that
principle
would
apply
here
because
of
your
ohio
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
we
independently
conclude
that
they
were
sufficiently
raised
for
our
purposes,
notwithstanding
your
ohio
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
they
weren't
properly
before
the
ohio
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it...
i
thought
it
was
the...
i
thought
the...
the
hooven
&
allison
was
the
appellee
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
unknown
speaker
were
you...
were
you
just
reading
from
your
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry.
is
that
the
one
at
a-17
and
18?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
in
the
record
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
mr.
nims,
does
something,
in
your
view,
turn
on
the
question
of
whether
when
this
court
says
we
leave
the
question
of
whether
hooven
&
allison
i
is
still
good
law
for
another
day,
does
that
mean
that
this
court
meant
that
only
this
court
was
free
to
disavow
that
case
in
the
light
of
michelin,
or
perhaps,
on
the
contrary,
that
any
court
having
jurisdiction
to
consider
constitutional
questions
could
look
at
michelin
alongside
hooven
&
allison
and
say
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
did
not
expressly
overrule,
but
it's
nonetheless
clear
that
michelin
is
inconsistent
with
hooven
&
allison,
and
therefore,
we
decide
that
hooven
&
allison
i
is
no
longer
good
law?
unknown
speaker
when
you...
when
you
say
look
at
the
facts
of
hooven,
you're
not
talking
about
the
facts
of
the
present
case
but
the
facts
of
hooven
i?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
what
factually
happened
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
something
the
board...
the
ohio
tax
commissioner
is
apt
to
have
a
great
deal
of
expertise?
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
you
know,
how
do
we
know
anything
more
about
the
ohio...
than
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals
about
how
a
certain
tax
impacts
on
the
third
world
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
know
all
that
much
of
our
own
knowledge
in
michelin
or
in
hooven-allison
i?
these
are
really
basically
not
factual
arguments
that
you're
suggesting
should
have
been
made,
but
kind
of
rough
judicial
notice
arguments,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
are
there
customs
warehouses
available
for
you
to
store
your
raw
materials
in
before
you
take
them
out
for
incorporation
into
your
product?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
asking...
i
just...
i
just
wondered
is
there
a
customs
warehouse
system
available
for...
to
protect
against
these
kinds
of
duties
until
they're
taken
out
for
local
consumption?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
were
located...
what
if
you
were
located
in
cleveland?
what
if
hooven
&
allison
were
located
in
cleveland
and
could
have
used
the
customs
warehouse
and
didn't?
do
you
think
that's
some
kind
of
congressional
suggestion
that
no
federal
policy
is
going
to
be
infringed
if
you
don't
use
the
customs
warehouse?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nims,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
unknown
speaker
you're
arguing
a
lot
of
facts
that
say
this
case
is
different
from
the
original
hooven
&
allison
case,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
are
all
those--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
first
of
all
we
start
with
hooven
&
allison.
is
this
the
same
or
a
different
case
than
hooven
&
allison
number
i?
unknown
speaker
if
we
start
from
the
premise
that
they're
the
same
facts,
then
we
really...
we
can
just
look
at
the
record
in
that
case
and
find
all
the
facts
we
need,
can't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
you
think
there
are
additional
1982
facts
or
'81
or
whenever
the
tax
was
assessed,
are
those
facts
now
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
didn't
you
have
the
burden
to
explain
why
the
tax
couldn't
properly
be
assessed?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
if
we
rely
on
that
reason--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
we
rely
on
the
reason
that
this
is
a
different
case,
then
i
suppose...
you
say
they
have
to
put
in
the
facts
why
they
go...
i
don't
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
procedurally.
unknown
speaker
and
they
won,
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
insofar
as
we're
working
with
a
change
in
the
law
as
to
whether
the
law
is
different
after
michelin,
it
seems
to
me
we
just
assumed
the
case
is
on
all
fours
with
the
prior
case.
at
least
that's
what
i've
done
in
looking
at
it.
and
if
i
think
that
michelin--
unknown
speaker
--overruled
hoover
i,
that's
all
i
have
to
decide.
what...
why
do
i
have
to
go
into
all
these
other
facts?
unknown
speaker
if
you
didn't
put
them
all
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
usually
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
is
an
affirmative
defense,
and
the
burden
is
on
the
party
pleading.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
supposing
we
disagree
and
say
it
was
reversed?
then
that's
the
end
of
the
ballgame.
unknown
speaker
you
are
if
ohio
says
you
can...
you
can
have
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
if
they
say
that,
you
can,
yeah.
unknown
speaker
while
they
were
in
the
warehouse.
unknown
speaker
how
about
for
the
period
they
were
in
the
warehouse?
unknown
speaker
so
if
hooven
put
their
fibers
in
bonded
warehouses
and
only
took
the
fibers
out
when
they
were
about
to
make
some
rope
out
of
them,
you
would
have
some
problems?
unknown
speaker
for...
for
the
period
of
time
that
the
fibers
were
in
the
warehouse.
unknown
speaker
unless
they--
