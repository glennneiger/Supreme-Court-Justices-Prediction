mr.
michael
nims
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
a
bit
mystified
by
the
position
the
tax
commissioner
is
taking
upon
the
procedural
posture
in
which
this
case
arrives
at
this
court,
and
i
think
it
needs
to
be
straightened
out.
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
in
the
cert
petition,
it
is
very
clear
at
page
17
in
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition
that
the
board
of
tax
appeals
specifically
noted
that
hooven
&
allison
was
raising
not
only
collateral
estoppel
issues,
but
going
beyond
that
and
saying,
and
if,
for
some
reason,
you
no
longer
think
hooven
does
state
the
law,
you
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions.
and
they
state
that
specifically
in
their
opinion,
which
is
printed
at
page
17
of
the
appendix
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
they
went
on
to
find
that
the
collateral
estoppel
arguments
were
well
taken,
because
hooven
did
remain
the
law,
not
having
been
reversed
by
this
court,
which
was
the
only
court
with
the
power
to
reverse
it;
and
they
noted
that
they
lacked
authority
to
decide
constitutional
issues
as
an
administrative
tribunal
anyway;
and
they
ruled
in
favor
of
hooven
&
allison's
position
on
collateral
estoppel
that
the
state
could
not
in
fact
collect
the
tax
it
was
seeking
to
assess.
in
order
to
protect
its
position
before
a
court
which
could
rule
upon
constitutional
issues,
hooven
&
allison
did
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
which
specifically
stated
that
the
board
erred
in
failing
to
find
that
the
tax
being
sought
was
proscribed
by
the
import-export
clause
and
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution--
mr.
michael
nims
--i
was
reading
from
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
by
hooven
&
allison.
and
those
arguments
were
made
before
the
ohio
supreme
court,
briefed
before
the
ohio
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
nims
--well,
the
appendix
a-17
and
18
is
the
opinion
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals.
the
notice
of
appeal
filed
by
hooven
&
allison
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
is
not
part
of
the
appendix,
but
i
was
reading
from
the
notice
of
appeal
which
was
filed.
mr.
michael
nims
it
is
in
the
record,
yes.
and
finally,
i
note
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
opinion,
the
last
thing
they
said
in
the
final
paragraph
before
holding
that
the
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
is
firm,
that
finding
that
the
tax
is
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
we
decline
to
address
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
hooven
in
its
appeal.
and
that's...
that's
printed
at
appendix
a-9
of
the
cert
petition.
so
i
think
it
is
very
apparent
that
the
procedural
posture
in
which
the
case
arrives
at
this
court
is
one
in
which
hooven
has
argued
all
along
below
that
this
court
decided
in
1945
that
this
very
tax
the
state
of
ohio
now
wants
to
exact
and
collect
was
unconstitutional,
it
has
not
been
overruled,
we
never
denied
that
michelin
required
one
to
review
the
opinion
and
determine
whether
hooven
had
been
overruled.
we
said
we
read
the
opinion;
we
don't
think
hooven
has
been
overruled.
the
court
clearly
has
left
that
decision
for
another
day,
and
it
remains
the
law.
mr.
michael
nims
i
think
a
court
could
do
that.
courts
are
obviously
hesitant
to
predict
what
this
court
would
do
on
constitutional
issues,
but
they
clearly
will
do
it
if
they
believe
they
have
an
adequate
basis
for
predicting
it.
but
what
turns
upon
that
is
the
fact
that
the
tax
commissioner
below
didn't
give
the
court
any
facts
upon
which
to
predict
what
this
court
would
do
if
it
looked
at
the
facts
in
the
hooven,
because
the
tax
commissioner
chose
below
a
different
strategy.
it
said
i'm
not
going
to
try
and
convince
you,
ohio
supreme
court,
that
if
you
look
at
all
the
facts
and
examine
the
three
policies
behind
the
import-export
clause
which
michelin
said
were
important,
and
look
at
how
this
tax
is
applied,
that
you
will
find
that
this
tax
does
not
prevent
the
state
or
the
nation
from
speaking
with
one
voice
on
import-export
policy.
you'll
find
that
this
tax
does
not
deprive
the
federal
government
of
the
opportunity
to
collect
the
duties
and
imposts
on
imports.
you'll
find
that
this
tax
does
not
create
an
opportunity
for
disharmony
among
the
states.
they
didn't
do
those
things
that
they
had
to
do
if
their
position
was
let's
look
at
the
facts
in
hooven
and
try
and
predict
what
the
united
states
supreme
court
will
do
if
it
were
given
those
facts
and
asked
to
apply
the
michelin
analysis.
mr.
michael
nims
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
mr.
michael
nims
the
only
thing
you
know
is
that
ohio
is
seeking
to
assess
an
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
on
imported
raw
materials
which
hooven
&
allison
subsequently
will
incorporate
into
its
manufacturing
processes.
you
don't
have
any
facts
about
how
that
tax
impacts,
how
it
interacts
with
federal
policy
on
dealing
with
third
world
countries,
on
exporting
raw
materials.
you
don't
have
the
facts.
mr.
michael
nims
no,
they're
not,
but
the
point
is
that
if
you
were
to
ask
the
board
of
tax
appeals
or
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
predict
what
this
court
would
do
applying
a
michelin
analysis
to
hooven
facts,
you've
got
to
give
it
some
facts.
mr.
michael
nims
you
don't
out
of
this
record
because
the
tax
commissioner
chose
consciously
not
to
put
anything
on
this
record
and
argued
hooven
in
i
has
been
implicitly
overruled.
mr.
michael
nims
well,
they're
facts.
admittedly,
one
has
to
take
judicial
notice.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
the
tax
you
were
looking
at
in
michelin
when
you,
by
looking
at
the
facts,
applying
whatever
judicial
notice
you
wanted
to
apply,
decided
that
tax
would
not
contravene
any
of
the
policies
that
you
saw
behind
the
import-export
clause.
there
are
a
lot
of
differences
between
that
analysis
involved
in
that
tax
and
the
analysis
that
would
be
made
in
looking
at
the
hooven
&
allen
tax...
the
hooven
&
allison
tax.
michelin,
you
had
a
situation
in
which
michelin,
major
competitor
of
domestic
tire
manufacturers,
has
got
all
its
tires
stored
in
georgia.
they're
ready
for
sale.
the
only
thing
that
remains
to
be
done
is
selling.
and
the
question
you
were
faced
with,
if
those
are
still
imports
under
the
original
package
doctrine,
the
state
of
georgia
can
never
tax
them,
because
the
next
thing
that's
going
to
happen
is
michelin
is
going
to
sell
them,
and
the
state
of
georgia
can
never
tax
them.
and
does
that
really
make
any
sense
when
you
look
at
the
policies
behind
the
import-export
clause?
but
we
have
a
very
different
situation
when
we
start
talking
about
importing
raw
materials,
for
which
there's
no
domestic
source,
which
are
going
to
be
incorporated
into
a
manufactured
product.
those
raw
materials
are
going
to
be
taxed.
that's
not
at
issue,
whereas
it
was
at
issue
in
michelin.
the
question
is
when
are
they
going
to
be
taxed
and
how
often
are
they
going
to
be
taxed.
they
come
in
as
raw
materials.
they're
not
sitting
there,
held,
ready
to
be
sold,
and
as
soon
as
hooven
&
allison
sells
them,
the
state
of
ohio
will
lose
its
opportunity
to
tax
them.
they're
sitting
in
a
warehouse
for
a
period
one,
three,
six
months,
depending
upon
how
much
backlog
hooven
&
allison
keeps
on
their
raw
materials,
and
then
they're
moved
onto
the
manufacturing
floor,
opened
up,
and
become
work
in
process.
at
that
point,
the
full
value,
the
full
value
of
those
imported
raw
materials
goes
into
the
tax
equation
and
ohio
collects.
what
the
state
of
ohio
is
trying
to
do
is
say
wait
a
minute,
we
don't
have
to
wait
until
you
put
those
raw
materials
into
your
manufacturing
process.
we'll
start
taxing
them
as
soon
as
they
hit
your
storage
warehouse.
they
don't
have
to
be
work
in
process.
as
soon
as
they
hit
your
storage
warehouse,
we
can
tax
them,
and
that's
okay
now
because
michelin
said
it's
okay.
michelin
didn't
say
that
was
okay.
michelin
didn't
deal
with
that
factual
situation.
you
even
pointed
out
in
michelin
that
you
weren't
dealing
in
michelin
with
tubes
which
michelin
was
going
to
later
put
into
tires
and
which
would
be
taxed
when
michelin
put
them
into
tires;
you
were
dealing
with
tires.
and
that
was
the
tax
that
you
had
to
juxtapose
against
the
policies
that
you
saw
behind
the
import-export
clause.
mr.
michael
nims
i
believe...
you're...
you're
getting
a
little
beyond
the
knowledge
i'm
sure
of.
i
believe
there
is
a
federal
customs
duty-free
warehouse
in
columbus,
but
columbus
is
quite
a
ways
from
xenia.
hooven
&
allison
is
not
general
motors.
transporting
materials
is
not
as
easy
for
little
hooven
&
allison,
which
makes
rope.
it
would
work
a...
it
would
have
a
major
impact
on
how
it
gets
its
goods.
mr.
michael
nims
like
i
say,
i
believe
there
is
a
duty-free
warehouse--
mr.
michael
nims
--in
columbus,
but
i'm
not
sure.
but
the
point
is,
the
point
is
to
the
extent
that
all
of
your
commerce
clause
analysis,
to
the
extent
that
your
import-export
clause
analysis
has
had
as
a
backdrop
your
concern
that
somebody
dealing
in
imported
goods
paid
his
fair
share
and
that
you
allow
a
tax
to
be
assessed,
the
only
effect
of
which
is
to
be
properly
apportioned
and
cause
him
to
pay
his
fair
share
for
those
services
he
uses,
that's
not
this
situation
at
all,
because
hooven
&
allison
is
going
to
do
that.
every
penny
that
goes--
mr.
michael
nims
--no,
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
i
think,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
general,
american
tariff
policy
on
dealing
with
raw
materials
from
undeveloped
nations
has
been
to
allow
them
in
duty-free
as
part
of
an
overall
economic
policy
to
help
underdeveloped
nations
maximize
their
development
and
achieve
what
they
can.
so
to
the
extent
that
federal
policy
is
important,
and
as
we
read
michelin,
you
didn't
say
anywhere
in
michelin,
federal
policy
is
no
longer
important;
indeed,
you
said
federal
policy
is
very
important.
what's
no
longer
important
is
original
package.
let's
look
at
what
the
tax
does
and
how
it
impacts
on
federal
policy.
to
the
extent
federal
policy
is
important,
federal
policy
is
a
very
definite
policy
in
dealing
with
underdeveloped
nations
exporting
raw
materials.
there's
simply
no
doubt
that
the
economic
reality...
and
it's
shown
in
mr.
bucks'
affidavit
which
is
contained
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
respondent...
economic
reality
is
that
the
sources
from
which
hooven
&
allison
can
obtain
these
natural
fibers
to
make
rope
are
charging
either
almost
exactly
the
same
price
to
sell
hooven
&
allison
the
raw
material
as
to
sell
it
the
finished
good,
or
in
some
cases,
even
a
higher
price
to
buy
the
raw
material
than
the
finished
goods.
and
the
obvious
reason
for
that,
they
want
hooven
&
allison
and
other
companies
to
put
their
manufacturing
facility
in
mexico,
and
in
bangladesh,
and
in
the
philippines,
and
employ
their
nationals.
mr.
michael
nims
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
nims
yes.
mr.
michael
nims
well,
and
it's
different
than
michelin,
more
importantly.
mr.
michael
nims
it
is
the
same
case,
the
same
tax,
the
same
facts
as
hooven
i.
the
question
is,
looking
at
those
facts
and
putting
this
supposed
change
in
legal
principles
that
came
along
in
michelin,
do
you
reach
a
different
constitutional
result
with
the
same
facts?
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
michael
nims
yes.
in
deal...
in
dealing
with
1940
sources,
1940
prices,
there
are
some
facts
in
that
record,
but
they
deal
in
1940s
economic
terms.
mr.
michael
nims
no.
mr.
michael
nims
no.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
this
court
has
already
said
the
tax
can't
be
assessed.
the
state
came
along
and
said
this
court--
mr.
michael
nims
--this
court
would
now
say
differently
given
michelin.
it
was
their
burden
to
show
that.
mr.
michael
nims
they--
mr.
michael
nims
--they
took
the
position,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
nims
--that
collateral
estoppel
wasn't
important,
and
the
reason
it
wasn't
important
is
even
though
the
supreme
court
of
ohio...
or
excuse
me...
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
previously
said
in
1945
that
the
very
tax
they
want
to
collect
is
unconstitutional,
you
can
ignore
that,
and
the
reason
you
can
ignore
it
is
because
if
you
read
michelin,
you'll
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
implicitly
overruled
hooven.
we
said--
mr.
michael
nims
--no.
you'll
find
that
they
haven't
overruled
hooven,
and
if
the
state
of
ohio
wants
to
tell
you
that
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
apply
a
michelin
analysis,
you
can
predict
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
will
now
reach
a
different
result
than
the
one
it
reached,
let
'em
prove
it
to
you,
because
we
think
if
you
look
at
those
facts,
you'll
find
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
will
reach
the
same
result.
but
they
chose
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
look
at
sunnen.
michelin
is
a
new
change
in
atmosphere.
mr.
michael
nims
assume
that--
mr.
michael
nims
--because--
mr.
michael
nims
--but,
your
honor,
you
would
be
putting
on
us
the
burden
to
put
in
the
record
to
show
that
a
case
we've
already
run
we're
still
ripe
on.
and
it
seems
to
me
at
the
very
least,
hawing
already
won
it,
we
ought
to
be
entitled
to
have
the
burden
put
on
the
party
who
says
it's
now
going
to
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
nims
yeah,
but...
but
we
met
the
burden
by
proving
that
hooven
i
remains
unreversed.
they're
the
ones
who
want
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
to
predict
that
that
won't
happen
again.
mr.
michael
nims
if
you
say
we
had
intended
to
reverse
it;
we're
surprised
you
didn't
find
it
reversed;
we
reverse
it,
there
is
no
doubt
it'll
go
back
and
the
state
of
ohio
will
say
it's
reversed,
and
we
will
then...
we
will
then
have
the
affirmative
burden
to
say
all
right,
by
gosh,
we're
going
to
win
it
again.
we're
going
to
win
it
on
new
constitutional
principles.
but
it's
our
position--
mr.
michael
nims
--sure
we
can.
so,
too,
can
the
state.
the
state
tried
to
shortcut
it
by
saying
forget
facts;
facts
are
irrelevant.
michelin
controls
all.
if
we
want
to
have
a
personal
property
tax,
we
can
have
one.
and
that...
that
shortcut
isn't
available,
we
don't
believe.
thank
you.
i
think
i've
said
all
i
need
to
say.
