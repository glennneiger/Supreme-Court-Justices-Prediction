mr.
albert
l.
purola
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
obviously
some
portion
of
the
ohio
syllabus
rule
is
important
in
this
case,
and
obviously,
even
though
double
jeopardy
seems
to
be
all
around
the
case,
the
judgment
below
rests
on
an
independent
adequate
state
ground.
the
questions
of
the
court
so
far
with
regard
to
petitioner's
argument
make
it
clear
that
that's
understood
as
a
problem
in
the
first
place.
the
syllabus
rule
is,
as
alluded
to
during
argument
that
the
ohio
supreme
court's
law
of
the
case,
the
only
part
of
the
judgment
that
commands...
that
necessarily
commands
a
majority
of
the
court
is
contained
in
the
syllabus
which
is
the
short
sentence
or
two
sentences.
it's
a
point
of
law
that
governs
the
case.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
suggest
that
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
only,
sir,
if--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--the
only
way
they
could
do
that,
sir,
would
be
if
the
syllabus
was
a
mask,
and
clearly
in
opposite
to
what
the
controlling
language
in
the
opinion
was.
i
don't
think
that
would
happen
all
the
time,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
zacchini
v.
scripps-howard,
this
court
recognized
in
an
opinion
by
justice
white
that
you
will
look
to
the
syllabus
to
define
the
law
of
the
case
that
it
is
controlling.
i
have
no
doubt
whatever,
however,
that
if
the
ohio
supreme
court
have
decided
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law
improperly
or
excessively,
they
could
not
hide
behind
that
local
rule
to
prevent
review
here.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
the
ohio
jurisprudence,
your
honor,
is
that
the
opinion
is
to
explicate
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
the
syllabus
that
goes
with
the
opinion
is
the
rule
which
is
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
is
the
opinion
of
any
precedential
value?
i
don't
know,
sir.
it's
to
expound
on
the
facts
that
the
particular
case
that
gave
the
genesis
to
the
syllabus
was
about.
but,
in
any
event--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--precisely,
justice
o'connor.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
zacchini.
the
syllabus
was
just
as
unclear.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
cannot
argue
that
federal
considerations
are
not
present
in
the
opinion.
i
do
argue
that
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
the
rule
of
michigan
v.
long
was
ever
written
to
contemplate
that
kind
of
a
situation,
where
one
syllabus
is
clearly
on
state
law
and
the
other
may
be
on
federal
law.
i
think
if
it
were
just
the
second
syllabus--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--i
think,
however,
that
the
long
decision
requires
the
court
to
look
at
the
opinion,
to
determine
if
within
the
four
corners
of
it
there
is
an
explication
of
some
independent
state
law
ground.
and
i
think
that
even
though
there
are
references
to
double
jeopardy
law
in
the
syllabus,
the
state
law
analysis,
partially
that
referred
to
by
justice
stevens
on
these
two
things
being
mutually
exclusive,
isn't
all
that
clearly
a
double
jeopardy
analysis.
but
i
cannot
rest
entirely
by
ignoring
the
long
presumption.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
think
in
syllabus
1--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--with
regard
to
syllabus
2.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
the
multiple
count
statute
is
what
i
identified,
yes.
and
clear...
it's
not
clear
either,
i
concede.
but
with
regard
to
the
independent
state
ground,
another
question
may
appear
as
to
whether
or
not,
if
the
judgment
below
rests
on
one
clearly
stated
syllabus
and
one
subject
to
the
michigan
v.
long
presumption,
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
is
here
or
the
desirability
of
issuing
a
decision
that
may
not
be
necessarily
viewed
as
binding
in
ohio.
and
i
don't
say
in
any
sense
of
they're
ignoring
you,
but
i
consider
the
possibility
that
ohio,
on
remand,
could
decide
this
case
solely
on
state
grounds
to
be
a
potential
risk.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--yes.
that
would
be
clearly
state
law
only
at
the
point.
in
the
event,
however,
that
the
judgment
below
is
found
to
be
based
at
least
in
part
on
federal
law,
it's
my
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
further
prosecution
in
this
case.
the
first
and
foremost
point
that
must
be
considered
over
and
over
again
as
far
as
the
respondent
is
concerned
is
that
he
has
been
convicted
by
a
valid,
unappealed
judgment
of
killing
thomas
hill
and
stealing
his
property.
that
conviction
is
final,
and
has
been
for
many...
long
period
of
time.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
used
the
word
"killing",
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
he
pleaded
guilty
to
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
that
is
what
he
is
in
jail
for
today.
in
my
view,
that
implicates
the
second
prong
of
the
north
carolina
v.
pearce
test
that
is
the
analysis
of
the
double
jeopardy
protection
where
there
has
been
a
prior
conviction.
there
has
been
a
prior
conviction
in
this
case,
and
it
is
an
extant
conviction
for
the
same
facts.
i
think
that
the
general
principles
of
not
quite
100
years
now,
but
in
re
nielsen
in
1889
point
out
that
where
a
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
that
may
have
multiple
parts
to
it,
he
may
not
be
subsequently
convicted
of
another
one
of
those
parts.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
absolutely,
sir.
i
do
not...
that's
my
position.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
in
brown
i
believe
that--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--i
am
not
sure
i
can
say
why
the
trial
judge
did
it,
but
my
position
was
at
that
time
that
at
the
general
issue,
at
the
arraignment,
the
rule
11
proceeding,
he
had
the
absolute
right
to
enter
the
statutorily
authorized
pleas
which
are,
i
think,
identical
to
the
federal
pleas...
guilty,
not
guilty...
and
only
no
contest
requires
the
consent
of
the
court,
and
he
was
able,
at
that
time,
to
not
have
any
prosecutorial
participation
in
his
plea
when
he
entered--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--well,
because
there
is
an
extant
conviction.
he
would
be
then
being
successively
prosecuted
for
the
offense
of
this
homicide
and
this
theft,
in
my
judgment
a
lesser
included
offense.
and
i
think
brown
precludes
that.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
indeed,
the
state's
consent
at
this
stage
wasn't
required.
we
certainly
don't
have
the
state's
consent
and
never
did
have
it.
there
is
no
question
about
their--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--yes.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
know
of
no
ohio
practice,
your
honor,
that
would
allow
an
appeal
at
that
point
on
that
issue.
and
i
make
the
point
in
my
brief
that
i
think
if
there
is
error
in
this
problem...
and
the
solicitor
general,
of
course,
suggested
as
amicus...
it
is
up
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
have
a
rule
that
allows
for
not
accepting
those
kinds
of
pleas
where
the
government
objects.
that
isn't
the
rule
in
ohio,
and
i
don't
think
an
appeal
is
possible.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
that's
the
reason,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
agree,
respectfully,
with
what
i
think
is
the
underlying
premise
to
your
question.
i
don't
think
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
at
all
implicated
until
the
state's
right
to
a
trial
has
grown
or
has
appeared.
and
at
the
arraignment,
they
do
not
have
an
independent
cognizable
right
to
a
trial.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
well,
i
think
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
might
reach
its
highest
point
if
this
further
trial
is
protected
or
is
precluded,
because
it
is
precisely
this
present
conviction,
brought
upon
by
this
accepted
final
plea,
that
makes
this
case
just
like
all
others
in
which
a
prior
judgment
has
precluded
the
trial.
and
i
think
that
it
is
not
our
position
to
suggest
at
all
that
the
state
has
an
independent
right
to
trial.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
without
question,
justice
stevens.
one
of
my
arguments
is
that
it
is
purely
a
question
of
state
law
discretion.
he
exercised
discretion
in
favor
of
the
plea.
he
did
not
have
to.
and
that
if
there
is
error
in
that,
that's
an
ohio
problem
which
should
be
corrected
there,
but
it
is
not
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes,
there
were.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
don't
think
it's
factually
or
legally
different.
in
fact,
there
was
obviously
one
sovereign
in
brown,
whether
it
was
two
counties
or
not.
in
fact,
they
were
guilty
pleas.
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
trial
in
brown.
he
pleaded
guilty
in
willoughby,
which
is
my
city,
and
then
next
door
in
cleveland.
and
i
think
that
the
point
of
brown
and
the
rationale
and
the
policies
of
brown
are
the
same
as
this
case.
i
don't
see
any
difference.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
that's
correct,
sir,
but
that
is
only
important
if
somebody
wants
to
equate
the
state's
right
to
proceed
with
the
defendant's
right
to
be
free
from
former
jeopardy.
and
i
do
not
equate
those.
i
think
that
the
state's
right
to
proceed
is
an
independent
right
coming
from
the
executive
branch,
and
it
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
defendant's
protection
v.
governmental
oppression,
which
i
consider
this
a
moderate
form
of,
not
a
great
form.
with
regard
to
the
normal
protections
attendant
with
a
double
jeopardy
clause,
clearly
two
things
must
be
satisfied:
one
is,
they
must
be
the
same
offense,
and
with
regard
to
these
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
today.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
serious
question
that
aggravated
robbery
and
theft
are
the
same
offense
for
purposes
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
consequently--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--sorry,
sir?
mr.
albert
l.
purola
no.
aggravated
robbery
and
theft
are
the
same
offense.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
no,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
charged
with
murder
and
involuntary
manslaughter.
i
maintain
that
the
manslaughter
and
murder
are
the
same
offense,
and
the
robbery
and
theft
are
the
same
offense
in
fifth
amendment
terms.
so
a
conviction
on
any
one
of
those
precludes
a
successive
prosecution
on
the
other
one.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
in
my
experience,
your
honor,
i
have
never
seen
it.
i
could
never
say
it's
common.
i
consider
it
uncommon.
i
have
never
seen
it
happen,
except
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
suppose
it
will
depend
on
how
i
do
here.
[laughter]
the
same
offense
question
is
obviously
a
constitutional
prerequisite
to
any
serious
application,
and
i
don't
think
it's
arguable
with
regard
to
theft
and
robbery.
there
have
been
questions
this
morning
or
this
afternoon,
regarding
whether
or
not
the
manslaughter
and
murder
are
the
same
offense,
or
at
least
are
they
lesser
included
offenses.
and
clearly,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
doubt
that
they
are
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
though
i'm
not
so
sure
that
i
would
want
to
venture
a
guess
on
whether
or
not
they're
a
lesser
included
offense
either,
except
for
state
v.
scott,
in
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
makes
direct
reference
to
the
fact
that
a
trial
on
murder
will
always
involve
a
jury
instruction
on
involuntary
manslaughter
in
the
case
where
the
evidence
would
warrant
it.
so
i
believe
that
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
without
question--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--yes.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
in
this
case
if
it
had
gone
to
trial
on
all
four,
he
could
have--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--right.
he
could
have
been
convicted
of
both
of
those
at
the
same
trial.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
do
not
believe
he
could
get
consecutive
sentences.
that
would
obviously...
in
fact,
i
believe
that
under
the
statute,
2941.25,
only
one
conviction
could
survive.
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
dismiss
one
of
the
cases
at
that
point.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
that's
right.
the
statutory
prohibition
v.
more
than
one
conviction...
and
i
think
in
my
petition,
or
i
mean
my
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
i
suggested
that
what
johnson
really
did
here
was
decide
himself
which
two
would
be
dismissed,
instead
of
waiting
until
there
was
a
multiple
conviction
and
letting
the
judge
decide,
because
it
wouldn't
take
much
imagination
to
determine
which
the
judge
would
dismiss
at
that
point,
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
the
manslaughter.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
oh,
yes.
i
meant
that
in
a
little
different
sense,
your
honor.
the
judge
had
clear
discretion,
could
have
refused
it.
when
i
meant
johnson
decided,
i
meant
he
attempted
to
do
it
and
in
this
case
was
successful.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
oh,
no.
he
would
ask
for
the
lesser.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
absolutely,
he
has
that
power.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
would
have
had
its
trial
on
this
indictment.
yes,
sir.
without
question.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
rule
29,
almost
identical
to
the
federal
rule,
that
kind
of
case.
the
question
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant/respondent
and
this
court
has
been
in
jeopardy
twice,
obviously
must
begin
with
the
question
of
whether
he's
been
in
jeopardy
once.
and
i
think
it
is
an
obvious
statement,
almost
not
worthy
of
repeating,
that
somebody
who
was
in
prison
on
a
valid
judgment
of
conviction
must
have
been
in
jeopardy.
this
court
has
recently,
as
recently
as
a
week
ago
today,
in
justices
of
boston
municipal
court
v.
lydon,
considered
the
question
of
what
is
the
termination
of
jeopardy
and
how
the
necessity
for
termination
must
be
dealt
with
in
order
for
a
proper
claim
of
double
jeopardy
to
be
considered.
i
argue
in
this
case
that
jeopardy
attached
and
terminated
within
the
period
of
time
it
took
to
accept
the
plea
and
to
enter
the
final
judgment.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes.
very
short
period
of
time,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
precisely.
if
i
don't
win,
the
remainder
will
be
considered.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
well,
yes,
but
that
will
all
depend
on
how...
the
outcome
of
this
hearing,
obviously.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
don't
know
if
the
state
argued
that.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
three
and
a
half
years
he
is.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
that,
except
the
arraigning
judge
asked
us,
the
defendant
and
myself,
what
problems
might
be
being
created
by
this
offer
of--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--no.
there
was
no
discussion
at
that
point,
and
there's
nothing
further
in
the
record
about
my
advice
to
him.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
well,
i
think
it
was
clear.
the
defendant
understand
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
it
on
these
grounds
would
be
made.
that's
all--
mr.
albert
l.
purola
--or
shortly
thereafter,
before
trial
was
scheduled.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
the
fundamental
difference
with
jeffers,
however,
jeffers
did
three
things.
he
first
denied
that
the
two
offenses
were
the
same.
he
secondly
overtly
opposed
trial
together
on
the
offenses,
the
846
and
848
section,
and
(3)
he
never
told
the
trial
judge
or
the
prosecution
what
might
be
happening.
kenneth
johnson
does
not
fit
any
of
those,
because
again
i
have
to
point
out
that
in
jeffers
there
was
an
arraignment
and
a
not-guilty
plea
and
two
trials
scheduled.
when
that
happens,
the
prosecutor...
u.s.
attorney
in
that
case...
becomes
an
integral
part
of
the
case.
one
of
my
major
points
in
this
court
is
that
on
state
law,
when
the
arraignment
is
the
first
opportunity
one
has
to
plead
to
the
indictment,
a
plea
of
guilty
will
obviate
the
necessity
of
the
prosecutor's
involvement
with
regard
to
that
and
eliminate
the
necessity
of
a
proceeding
on
the
same
offense.
that
is
different
than
jeffers.
jeffers
did
clearly
deny
that
the
two
offenses
were
the
same.
johnson
took
precisely
the
opposite
tack.
jeffers
also
wanted
two
separate
trials
once
the
issue
was
joined.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the
issue
wasn't
joined
at
all
on
the
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
theft,
and
clearly
the
court
knew
what
the
defendant's
motion
was
going
to
be
after
the
plea
was
accepted.
in
fact,
what
this
points
to
is
that
this
somewhat
unusual
set
of
proceedings
is
maybe
an
aberrant
state
law
arrangement.
it
maybe
isn't
a
double
jeopardy
matter
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
shouldn't
be
implicated
if
this
whole
problem
could
have
been
corrected
or
could
be
corrected
by
a
state
law
ruling
or
a
state
law
modification,
which
i
think
is
an
excellent
reason
for
this
court
not
to
produce
a
decision
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause
on
this
fact
setting,
which
is
unusual,
likely
to
be
unrepeated,
at
least
in
most
cases,
and
i
think
that
the
state
law
thing
is
the
way
to
handle
this
position.
the
government
argues
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
united
states
that
they
would
just
suggest
to
you,
if
this
were
a
federal
case,
that
the
plea
be
vacated
because
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
accept
it.
that
isn't
the
rule
in
the
federal
courts
either.
but
this
court
clearly,
under
its
power,
could
suggest
that,
if
not
order
it.
but
in
state
law,
that's
not
a
matter
for
this
court
to
decide.
with
regard
to
why
a
second
trial
now,
or
a
trial
now
will
be
a
second
prosecution...
and
i
point
out
that
pearce
uses
the
word
"prosecution",
not
"trial"...
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
that
this
is
a
guilt-related
ending
of
the
first
proceeding
which
is
significantly
different
than
other
interruptions
in
proceedings
that
are
not
guilt-related.
and
that
difference
has
always
made
a...
i
mean
that
distinction
has
always
made
a
difference
to
the
court.
in
this
particular
case,
johnson's
guilt
was
established
on
the
very
first
day,
at
least
to
the
facts
that
took
place
on
january
25,
1979.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
i
could
not
have
prevented
it,
justice
stevens.
he
could
have
nolle'd
it
at
his
will.
and
i
guess
the
timing
is
important.
the
original
arraignment
on
october
9th
did
not
result
in
the
final
entry
of
any
plea.
that
judge
reserved
ruling,
sent
it
to
the
judge
that
drew
the
case,
and
it
wasn't
finally
decided
until
the
following
month.
with
regard
to
one
issue
that
may
seem
to
be
in
this
case,
the
idea
of
continuing
jeopardy,
one
that
this
court
has
grappled
with,
if
not
directly,
at
least
tangentially
recently.
it's
clear
that
continuing
jeopardy
has
never
been
undertaken,
at
least
in
the
sense
of
justice
holmes's
dissent,
to
be
an
acceptable
way
of
analyzing
double
jeopardy
principles.
this
case
is
much
like
reed
v.
jones
in
the
sense
that
no
analysis
could
allow
the
prosecution
to
go
forward
on
the
theory
that
mr.
johnson
is
still
in
jeopardy,
and
that's
why
i
think
the
case
decided
last
wednesday
about
lydon
talks
about
the
termination.
but
i
think
that
ends
the
jeopardy,
because
the
justifications
for
a
continuing
jeopardy
referred
to
in
last
week's
case
all
seem
to
be
met
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
this
would
be
the
case,
if
this
court
were
ever
inclined
to
adopt
a
continuing
jeopardy
notion
to
perhaps
give
the
state
the
right
to
stay
in
the
case,
i
don't
think
this
would
be
the
case
to
adopt
it
in,
though
i
certainly
don't
suggest
it
should
be
adopted
at
all,
but
ideas
of
fairness
to
society,
lack
of
finality,
and
limited
waiver
are
all,
in
this
case,
resolved
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
it
may
not
be
what
all
would
choose,
but
the
fact
that
mr.
johnson
has
been
convicted
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
been
imprisoned
for
the
maximum
term
allowed
by
state
law,
by
the
trial
judge,
is
fair
to
society.
he
is
not
escaping
this
conduct.
he
was
consequently,
or
in
addition,
was
sentenced
consecutively
for
the
theft
which
was
never
challenged.
it
is
final,
another
suggestion
in
justice
white's
opinion
last
week
that
deals
with
continuing
jeopardy.
this
is
final.
there
isn't
any
obvious
need
to
not
have
this
over
with.
it
is
over,
and
there's
clearly
no
waiver
of
mr.
johnson's
right
to
end
his
case.
my
time
is
nearly
over.
i
would
like
to
end
by
saying
that
this
unique
case
is
not
the
vehicle,
in
my
view,
to
change
again
the
principles
of
double
jeopardy
that
have
started
to
be
changed
in
recent
years.
it
seems
that
this
country
survived
a
very
long
time
on
very
few
double
jeopardy
opinions.
mr.
albert
l.
purola
precisely.
and
some
states
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
double
jeopardy,
notably
connecticut,
prior
to
1969.
but
i
believe
that
the
principles
of
cases
like
ex
parte
lang
and
perez
and
nielsen
are
sufficient
to
govern
double
jeopardy
jurisprudence.
and
even
if
this
case
would
warrant
a
different
consideration,
the
unique
facts
of
this
case,
coupled
with
ohio
law's
very
unusual
treatment
in
this
case,
is
not
one
where
this
court
should
attempt
to
engraft
or
to
engraft
a
different
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
this
case
may
not
be
further
prosecuted
because
another
proceeding
is
barred
by
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you
very
much.
