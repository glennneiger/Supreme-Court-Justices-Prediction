mr.
john
e.
shoop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
january
25,
1979,
one
thomas
hill
was
shot
to
death
at
his
apartment
in
the
city
of
mentor
on
the
lake,
lake
county,
state
of
ohio.
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
arrested
within
12
hours,
and
a
preliminary
hearing
was
held
within
five
days
in
mentor
municipal
court.
but
the
defendant/respondent,
was
released
because
the
city
prosecutor
only
charged
the
defendant
with
murder,
and
at
the
preliminary
hearing
stage,
failed
to
introduce
a
certified
copy
of
thomas
hill's
death
certificate.
as
a
result,
the
charge
of
murder
was
dismissed,
and
thomas
hill
was
released,
and
his
bond
released
also.
subsequently,
on
february
13,
1979,
the
lake
county
grand
jury
found
probable
cause
existed
to
believe
that
the
defendant,
respondent
in
this
case,
had
violated
four
separate
criminal
statutes
and
returned
one
indictment
charging
this
defendant/respondent
with
one
count
each
of
murder,
involuntary
manslaughter,
aggravated
robbery,
and
grand
theft.
the
defendant/respondent
had
already
filed
the
jurisdiction
before
the
grand
jury
indictment
had
returned.
and
20
months
later
he
was
apprehended
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
returned
to
the
state
of
ohio.
on
october
9,
1980,
the
defendant/respondent
appeared
before
the
lake
county
common
pleas
court
for
the
purposes
of
arraignment
on
the
aforementioned
indictment.
at
that
point,
he
proffered
pleas
of
guilty
to
involuntary
manslaughter
and
grand
theft,
and
not
guilty
pleas
to
murder
and
aggravated
robbery.
the
state
objected.
bond
was
set,
and
the
case
assigned
to
a
different
trial
court,
which
had
then
to
decide
whether
to
accept
the
proffered
pleas
of
guilty
which
the
first
court
reserved
ruling
upon.
on
november
26,
1980,
following
written
arguments,
without
any
testimony
or
evidence
even
proffered,
the
trial
court
was
persuaded
by
the
defendant/respondent
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
accepted
the
guilty
pleas
on
involuntary
manslaughter
and
grand
theft.
at
the...
going
back
for
a
moment--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--correct.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
the
event
is
not
directed
at
whether
or
not
it's
common
to
reject
the
prosecutor's
plea.
most
of
the
courts
in
ohio
accept
recommendations
from
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
so
forth
on
various
events.
as
far
as
written
guilty
pleas
or
pleas
at
the
arraignment,
this
was
a
unique
situation
evidenced
by
the
trial
court.
the
initial...
the
arraigning
judge's
initial
comments
when
the
guilty
pleas
were
proffered,
and
he
said,
"this
is
unusual;
we
will
have
to
think
about
this.
"
"does
everyone
know
what
is
happening?
"
"do
you
recognize
the
consequences
of
this?
"
and
at
that
point,
the
trial
attorney
responded,
"yes.
"
"this
may
anticipate
some...
double
jeopardy
provisions
may
be
implicated
here.
"
mr.
john
e.
shoop
both.
the
defense
counsel
evidenced
that
immediately.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
not
in
every
instance.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
it
is
a
lesser
offense.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
on
november
26,
1980,
following
the
written
arguments,
without
any
testimony
even
offered
or
proffered,
the
trial
court
was
persuaded
to
accept
the
guilty
pleas,
as
i
said.
the
court
sentenced
the
defendant/respondent
to
consecutive
sentences,
three
to
ten
years
on
involuntary
manslaughter.
that
is...
in
the
state
of
ohio
we
have
indeterminate
sentences,
so
it
is
a
minimum
of
three
to
ten
years,
and
of
course
the
minimum
can
be
reduced
by
the
ohio
adult
parole
authority.
and
the
second
sentence
was
two
to
five
years
on
grand
theft,
to
be
served
consecutively.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
it
is
possible
that
he
could
serve
only
five
years,
and
likely
that
he
would
serve
even
less
because
of
the
ohio
adult
parole
authority's
interpretations
and
understanding
and
control
of
release
of
those
that
are
incarcerated
under
indeterminate
sentencing.
following
these
pleas
the
defendant/respondent
moved
to
dismiss
the
murder
and
aggravated
robbery
counts
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy,
arguing
multiple
prosecution
and
collateral
estoppel.
on
march
31,
1981
the
trial
courts,
after
briefs
and
arguments,
again
without
any
evidence
or
testimony
even
proffered,
granted
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
double
jeopardy
grounds.
thereupon,
the
state
appealed
to
the
trial
court's
dismissal
of
the
murder
and
aggravated
robbery.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
looking
for
is...
or
trying
to
establish
in
the
fact
pattern
is
that
we
have
not
ultimately
had
one
full
litigated
trial.
i'm
attempting
to
establish
that
through
the
fact
pattern
also,
that
nothing
has
been
testified
to.
the
state
appealed
this
dismissal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
again,
based
on
double
jeopardy
provisions
and
understandings
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
appeal
was
affirmed,
the
trial
court's
dismissal
on
those
grounds;
thereupon,
we
appealed
to
the
state
supreme
court,
which
on
august
31,
1983
affirmed
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
upholding
the
trial
court's
dismissal,
again
all
based
on
federal
double
jeopardy
understandings
and
provisions.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
agree
with
justice
o'connor.
i
have
the
same
apprehensions
through
every
decision
of
each
court
and
judge,
except
for
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
locar
in
the
ohio
supreme
court,
"they
have
misunderstood
and
misapplied
all
the
blockburger
double
jeopardy,
north
carolina
v.
pearce
applications
of
double
jeopardy
in
this
situation.
"
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
can
only
understand
from
all
of
the
court's
holdings
in
ohio
that
there
is
no
decision
that
we
can
find
which
specifically
states
that
murder
or
involuntary
manslaughter
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
crime
of
murder.
and
in
the
respondent's
brief
he
cites
state
v.
willis
for
supporting
that
proposition,
and
upon
perusing
state
v.
willis
you'll
find
out
that
that
is...
or
have
found
out...
that
that
is
a
sexual
assault
case
and
goes
to
the
charging
instrument,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
crimes
of
murder
or
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
in
my
argument
i
say
yes,
they
are.
and
the
difference
is
that,
as
the
courts
below
have
tried
to
interpret
the
mental
states
requisite
in
order
to
include
these
in
the
blockburger
test
or
under
ohio
revised
code
2941.25,
which
is
our
multiple
counts
statute,
they
have
attempted
to
say
that
the
mental
state
requisite
in
murder,
which
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio
is
purposely,
that
mental
state
is
fulfilled
with
any
lesser
mental
state
which
may
be
encompassed
in
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge.
and
i
vehemently
disagree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
would
have
to
state
that
armed
robbery...
excuse
me...
aggravated
robbery
and
grand
theft,
that
because
of
peculiarity
in
the
charging
verbiage
that
was
used,
aggravated
robbery
can
be
charged
either
as
threatening
the
force
or,
in
the
second
section,
having
a
concealed
weapon
or
weapon
upon
their
person,
whereas
theft
then
would
only
encompass
the
theft.
i
would
say
that
that,
because
in
this
instance
of
the
charge
and
the
way
it
was
framed,
that
in
this
instance
i
would
have
to
agree
that
probably
the
theft
and
the
aggravated
robbery
have
been
charged
as
lesser
included
offenses.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
don't
believe
that
it's
all
state
law,
because
they
apply
all
of
the
blockburger
tests
in
their
application
and
understanding.
whether
they're
using
2941.25
or
they're
using
just
the
double
jeopardy
standards,
everything
that
points
and
applies
to
this
situation
and
their
understanding
and
their
interpretations
of
even
the
state
statutes
is
all
done
in
light
of
federal
double
jeopardy
standards,
case
law,
and
decisions.
i
did
not
quite
finish
with
justice
o'connor's
question,
but
i
believe
that
the
separation
of
the
murder
and
the
involuntary
manslaughter
can
be
shown
under
blockburger
and
the
mental
state
requisite
in
the
murder
statute
is
purposeful,
and
the
mental
state
in
the
involuntary
manslaughter
may
be
totally
absent
of
any
mental
state
requisite
to
causing
the
death
of
an
individual.
in
this
case
the
requisite
mental
state--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--no,
the
state
did
not.
we
never
proposed
dismissing
those
charges
because
case
law
in
the
state
of
ohio
up
to
this
point
had
not
said
anything
that
gave
any
indication
that
involuntary
manslaughter
in
this
specific
case
could
be
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
this
specific
case.
we
had
no
indication
until
we
got
to
johnson,
then,
that
the
court
was
going
to
make
any
kind
of
ruling
with
this
regard.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
do
not
believe
that
they
stated
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
i
believe,
as
a
specific
term
of
art,
lesser
included
offense.
it
is
a
lesser
offense.
it
may
be
an
allied
offense
of
similar
import,
according
to
our
statute--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--yes.
and
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
explain.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
we
have
a
lower
offense
which
has
a
separate,
distinct
element
necessary
in
its
proof,
and
a
higher
offense
which
also
has
a
separate
and
distinct
element.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
it
is
only
mental
in...
that
is
part
of
the
misinterpretation
of
the
ohio
courts.
it
is
only
mental
in
the
murder
case.
there
may
be
no
mental
state
at
all,
other
than
some
mental
state
to
commit
the
crime
itself.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
purpose
to
kill.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
all
right.
that
is
the
element
of
the
theft
offense
or
some
misdemeanor
or
some--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--the
act
of
committing
some
misdemeanor.
that
is
an
element
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter.
any
misdemeanor
commissioned
which
can
proximately
be
related
to
the
cause
of
death
of
somebody
else
is
the
only
element.
it
is
the
distinguishing
element.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
under
syllabus
law,
that
is
initially--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--initially,
the
limitation
would
be
there
if
the
syllabus
can
be
construed
to
be
clear
and
unambiguous
on
its
face.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes.
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
i--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--yes.
to
me.
and
i
believe
it
has
been
to
every
court
that
has
attempted
to
understand
that
reasoning.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
think
i
understand
our
problem.
in
our
hearts,
we
know
there
has
only
been
one
death,
and
we
say
this
is
incongruous,
that
we
ought
to
be
allowed
to
do
this
kind...
or
the
state
should
be
allowed
to
do
this.
but
the
state
specifically
set
up
guidelines
to
allow
for
multiple
counts,
multiple
convictions,
even
under
the
federal
guidelines
in
one
proceeding.
and
we
have
to
keep
that
in
mind.
under
the
federal
law,
we
are
still
under
one
proceeding.
the
courts
below
have
adopted
this
duality
of
purpose
or
subject
to
future
events,
causing
this
case
to
now
be
here
before
this
court
as
if
it
is
a
legitimate
double
jeopardy
application.
we
have
not
reached
the
double
jeopardy
threshold.
the
argument
presumes
an
intended
result,
we
certainly
hope.
but
if
we
reach
that
upon
remand
and
the
case
is
remanded,
then
we
can
address
the
questions,
and
there
are
safeguards
within
the
state
statutes
to
protect
the
rights
so
that
an
individual
cannot
be
charged.
the
intent...
it
is
very
important,
i
believe,
to
understand
that
the
mental
state
in
murder
relates
to
the
mental
state,
the
culpability
of
taking
a
person's
life.
the
mental
state
requisite,
if
any,
that
the
courts
tried
to
attach
in
the
misdemeanor
or
in
the
involuntary
manslaughter
has
nothing
to
do
with
taking
a
person's
life.
the
mental
states
are
entirely
different.
the
element
of
theft
or
discharging
a
firearm
within
a
city
limits,
discharging
a
firearm,
requires
no
requisite
mental
intent.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
correct.
in
the
higher
crime,
the
mens
rea
goes
to
the
intention
of
killing
someone.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
disagree.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
ah,
now
we're
beginning
to
understand.
[laughter]
they
could
be
mutually--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--that
is...
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
no,
i
didn't
say
the--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--no,
i
did
not
say...
i
hope
i
did
not.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
then
i
perhaps
did
not
understand
your
question
as
to
the
mutual
exclusive
proposition.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
no.
i
believe
they
are
entirely
separate
offenses.
and
if
allowed
to
be
tried,
we
may
be
able
to
establish
that
they
are
not
even
lesser
included
offenses,
and
be
allowed
to
convict
and
charge
on
both.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
we've
never
had
that
opportunity
to
present
that
one
full
litigated
issue
or
trial.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
we
have
not
had
one
full
hearing
yet.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
absolutely.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
i
would
think
that
i
would
ask
the
court
to
accept--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--i
understand.
because
they
are
interpreting
ohio
law
and
that
statute
in
light
of
federal
double
jeopardy
standards,
and
i
think
you
can
make
a
directive
back
to
them
that
the
federal
law
would
understand
that
these
are
separate
elements
for
the
purposes--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--that
is
part
of--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--correct.
and
that
is
part
of
the
problem
with
this
entire
case,
is
that
most
of
it
has
been
an
academic
carrot
that
has
been
tossed
out,
and
everyone
seems
to
be
leaning
over
backwards
to
try
to
reach
for
that
carrot,
and
they
have
missed
the
double
jeopardy
constitutional
protections
that
have
been
provided,
that
the
state
has
provided
and
will
continue
to
provide
throughout
this.
i've
noticed
that
my
time
is
up
for
the
moment.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
they
could,
but
they
didn't.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
they
did
this
through
application
of
blockburger.
and
i
believe
that
in
reviewing
the
elements
there,
you
can
see
the
different
elements
which
takes
this
out
of
that,
i
argue,
double
jeopardy
provision.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
just
a
few
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fifth
amendment
provisions
and
protections
that
have
steered
this
entire
case
through
the
courts
rely
upon
prohibitions
against
unlawful
government
oppressive
practices,
protections
afforded
to
the
accused.
in
singer,
though,
the
court...
this
court...
has
stated
that
the
state
and
the
government
does
have
a
right
to
one
full
trial.
and
we
ask
for
that.
there
has
been
no
state
action
by
the
prosecutor,
by
the
state
of
ohio,
that
is
oppressive,
that
is
burdensome,
that
is
placing
an
extra
burden
upon
this
accused.
all
that
has
happened
is
he
has
chosen
to
attempt
a
ploy
that
would
now
put
restrictive
and
very
binding
confines
on
the
application
of
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
to
the
state
in
these
matters.
2941.25
of
the
ohio
revised
code
is
a
statutory
embodiment
of
the
federal
law
in
this
area,
and
it's
intended
to
extend,
by
statute,
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
defendant
and,
in
doing
so,
it
extends
also
the
weighing
and
balancing
tests
that
must
be
performed
and
the
intended
protections
must
be
weighed
v.
the
public
interest,
both
by
the
double
jeopardy
provisions
and
by
2941.25.
the
state
did
exactly
what
it
was
required
to
do.
the
defendant
has
artificially
attempted
to
create
a
double
jeopardy
problem
where
one
does
not
exist.
we
ask
you
to
reverse
and
to
remand
and
to
strongly
indicate
to
the
courts
of
ohio
how
to
properly
understand
and
interpret
similar
acts
and
lesser
offenses
under
the
blockburger
test,
according
to
the
double
jeopardy
standards
that
they
have
attempted
to
apply.
thank
you.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes.
that
is
an
alternative.
it
is
not
one
that
we
control.
we
could
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
we
would
at
this
point
like
to
nolle
or
dismiss
the
case,
but
the
court
was
free
to
not
accept
our
refusal
and
proceed
as
it
did.
it
was
not
indicated
at
the
time
that
it
was
even
going
to
be
a
problem.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
on
the
murder.
there
are
different
theories
for
the
applications
of
the
two
crimes.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
under
double
jeopardy,
your
provision
is.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
yes.
mr.
john
e.
shoop
under
2941.25,
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would.
if
the
ohio
courts
continue
to
apply
that
statute
and
interpret
it
that
these
are,
once
they
have
learned
all
of
the
facts
and
can
distinguish
whether
or
not
the
elements
are
the
same--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--yes.
and--
mr.
john
e.
shoop
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
courts
would
allow
us
to
have
both
at
this
time.
