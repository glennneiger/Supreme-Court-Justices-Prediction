unknown
speaker
mr.
shoop,
is
that
a
common
practice
in
ohio
for
the
judge
to
refuse
the
prosecution's
demand
to
go
on
to
trial?
the
prosecution
was
asking
to
go
to
trial
on
all
the
issues?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
common
thing,
this
event
that
occurred
here?
unknown
speaker
who?
the
prosecutor
or
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
did
they
specifically
mention
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it,
under
ohio
practice,
grand
theft
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
aggravated
robbery--
unknown
speaker
--or
at
least
is
a
lesser
offense.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
it's
possible
that
he'd
serve
only
five
years
altogether,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shoop,
you
mentioned
that
the
motion
was
granted
without
any
testimony.
would
one
ordinarily
expect
testimony
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shoop,
the
supreme
court
opinion
never
says
clearly
whether
involuntary
manslaughter
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder.
in
fact,
it
seems
to
say
contradictory
things;
in
one
place,
that
the
two
offenses
are
mutually
exclusive.
and
then
it
says
that
the
blockburger
test
for
the
same
offense
is
met.
what
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
meant
in
its
opinion?
what
is
it
holding?
i
couldn't
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
which
the
court
was
holding?
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
offenses
mutually
exclusive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shoop,
before
justice
o'connor's
question,
you
made
the
statement
that
the
ohio
courts
have
reached
their
conclusion
on
federal
double
jeopardy
grounds.
do
you
include
both
combinations?
on
the
one
hand,
murder
and
manslaughter,
i
think
i
can
go
along
with
you.
what
about
aggravated
robbery
and
grand
theft?
do
you
think
plausible
argument
can
be
made
that
their
decision
there
was
on
adequate
and
independent
state
ground?
unknown
speaker
this
takes
me,
of
course,
to
what
i
regard
as
a
very
strange
rule,
this
syllabus
rule
you
have
in
the
state
of
ohio,
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
in
effect
anywhere
else.
but
as
i
read
the
syllabus
on
that
side
of
the
four
issues,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it's
all
state
law.
unknown
speaker
when
the
trial
judge
indicated
he
was
going
to
accept
these
pleas,
did
the
state
ever
propose
dismissing
those
charges
and
going
ahead
on
murder
and
aggravated
robbery?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
though,
in
johnson
itself,
did
the
ohio
supreme
court
uphold
that
involuntary
manslaughter
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
murder?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two
offenses
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
other
than
the
mental
state
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
what
is
there,
other
than
the
mental
state
of
the
defendant,
that
is
different
between
the
two
offenses?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that
element,
apart
from
the
mental
state
of
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
in
the
murder
case
you
have
to
prove
purpose.
unknown
speaker
purpose
to
kill.
all
right.
that's
an
element
of
murder.
what
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter
is
there
that
is
not
an
element
of
murder?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
i'm
asking
only
about
the
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
murder.
my
question
is,
what
element
of
the
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter
is
not
also
an
element
of
the
offense
of
murder?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
shoop,
on
this
question,
getting
back
to
my
brother
blackmun's
question
to
you
about
that
silly
rule
of
yours
on
syllabus,
do
i
take
it
that
they
(1)...
those
two
paragraphs,
they
are
the
holdings,
are
they,
of
your
supreme
court?
syllabi,
at
page
a1?
unknown
speaker
what
is
syllabus
law?
are
we
foreclosed
in
trying
to
determine
what
your
supreme
court
held
from
looking
at
the
opinion?
are
we
limited
by
the
syllabus
rule
to
what's
stated
in
those
two
paragraphs?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
right
there
the
first
one
is
"aggravated
robbery
is
an
allied
offense
of
similar
import
to
theft.
"
now,
that's...
you,
i
think,
said
earlier
that
indicates
that
theft
is
an
element
of--
unknown
speaker
--how
does
that
differ
from
what
paragraph
2
says?
"the
offenses
of
murder
and
involuntary
manslaughter
share
the
common
element
of
causing
the
death
of
another
and
are
distinguishable
only
by
the
offender's
mental
state.
"
now,
is
that
ambiguous?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
some...
well,
it
may
be
wrong,
but
that's
your
law
apparently.
that's
your
state
law.
unknown
speaker
you
said
they
are
entirely
different.
they
are
different,
i
take
it
you
mean,
in
the
sense
that
in
one
case
there
must
be
the
mens
rea,
the
intent,
and
in
the
other
case
that
must
be
absent.
unknown
speaker
but
then
if
he's
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter,
he
cannot
be
guilty
of
murder.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
he
have
both
no
mental
state
and
the
wrong
mental
state?
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
you
said
they
were
mutually
exclusive,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
so,
if
you
find
that
person--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
said
that.
now,
if
the
person
then
is
found
guilty
or
pleads
guilty
to
involuntary
manslaughter,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal
on
murder,
and
you'd
be
collaterally
estopped
for
going
from
there.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
did
in
response
to
my
question,
that
you
believed
that
it
was
mutually
exclusive.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
they're
mutually
exclusive.
unknown
speaker
but
then,
if
i
understand
you--
--your
question
of
lesser
included
offense,
as
between
first
degree
murder
and
manslaughter,
you
never
had
your
chance--
unknown
speaker
--so
whatever
the
law
may
be
with
respect
to
matters
arising
under
the
green
case,
green
v.
the
united
states,
are
not
at
all
present
here.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shoop,
let
me
go
back,
if
i
may.
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
that
involuntary
manslaughter
involves
a
lesser
mental
state,
and
i
think
you've
agreed
that
they're
different,
as
it
is
"killing
which
proximately
results
from
the
defendant's
committing
or
attempting
to
commit
another
offense.
"
"it
is
manifestly
obvious
that
these
two
states.
"
--and
understand,
that's
two
states
of
mind...
"are
mutually
exclusive
and
that
in
any
given
killing,
the
offender
may
be
possessed
of
only
one.
"
as
i
understand
you,
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
so
we
should
follow
you,
rather
than
the
ohio
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
and
to
disagree
with
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
about
ohio
law?
unknown
speaker
now,
whether
you
are
correct
or
not,
or
whether
the
ohio
court
is
correct,
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
this
case
when
there
was
a
guilty
plea
taken
on
the
two
very
minor
charges,
and
you
never
got
any
kind
of
a
homicide
case
before
either
a
jury
or
the
court?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
really
academic
discussion.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
shoop,
don't
you
think
the
ohio
court
would
have
reached
exactly
the
same
result
without
any
regard
to
federal
standards
under
your
double...
under
your
multiple
count
statute?
it
specifically
says
that
the
general
assembly
has
further
effectuated
the
principles
contained
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
by
means
of
their
multiple
count
statute,
and
then
it
quotes
the
multiple
count
statute
and
goes
on.
it
seems
to
me
like
they
would
have
reached
exactly
the
same
result
under
that...
just
your
local
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
they
did.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
they
were
necessarily
relying
on
federal
principles.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that's
binding
on
this
court?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
if
that's
correct,
then
a
state
court
could
decide
federal
questions,
cases
like
this
on
federal
grounds,
and
hide
behind
a
syllabus
rule
which
was
silent
on
the
grounds.
and
this
court
could
never
review.
unknown
speaker
i
can
assure
that,
speaking
for
one
member
of
the
court,
the
ohio
syllabus
rule
would
have
no
weight
with
me
whatever
when
it
would
permit
a
court
to
hide
behind...
or
to
decide
a
federal
question,
and
insulate
it
from
review
here
by
this
specious
kind
of
charade.
unknown
speaker
if
you
know,
why
does
the
ohio
court
file
an
opinion?
if
you
know.
unknown
speaker
mr.
purola,
as
to
the
second
paragraph
of
the
syllabus
in
this
case,
dealing
with
murder
and
manslaughter,
it
just
says
basically
that
the
prohibition
v.
double
jeopardy
requires
the
result.
and
it
isn't
clear
from
the
syllabus
alone
whether
it's
the
federal
prohibition
of
some
state
requirement.
now,
doesn't
zacchini
v.
scripps-howard
indicate
that
under
those
circumstances,
we
go
ahead
and
read
the
opinion
to
see
if
the
reliance
was
on
federal
or
state
law?
unknown
speaker
right.
so
we
go
ahead
and
look
then
at
what
the
opinion
said,
at
least
as
to
that
murder
manslaughter
question,
and
when
we
do
that,
doesn't
it
show
us
that
the
court
was
relying
on
federal
law
as
to
the
murder
manslaughter
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
two
issues.
you
have
the
theft
aggravated
robbery
that
you
can
treat
separately,
and
then
you
have
the
murder
manslaughter
issue,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
multiple
state
statute
that
the
court
referred
to
as
implementing
double
jeopardy
principles?
do
you
think
the
court
rested
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
no;
in
the
opinion.
you
invite
us
to
look
at
the
opinion
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
when
you
do,
what
independent
state
ground
do
you
identify?
the
multiple
count
statute?
unknown
speaker
under
the
multiple
count
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
then
they
would
be
taking
exclusive
responsibility,
were
it
not
asking
a
sharing
of
a
federal
ground.
unknown
speaker
say
that
again.
he
was
convicted
of?
unknown
speaker
did
he
plead
guilty
to--
unknown
speaker
--even
though
he
wasn't
tried
and
convicted?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
brown
v.
ohio
involved
a
trial
of
a
lesser
offense.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
good
way,
if
you
could
get
away
with
it,
isn't
it?
how
did
you
ever
persuade
the
trial
judge
to
accept
these
pleas
over
the
opposition
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
and
why
does
that
follow...
why
is
the
state
then
prevented
from
going
ahead
with
a
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
but
not
with
the
state's
consent.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
appeal?
are
you
finished
with
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
have
taken
an
appeal
from
this
rather
extraordinary
action
of
the
trial
judge
on
the
question
of
the
trial
judge's
authority
to
take
the
plea
to
a
minor
offense
and
deny
the
state
the
right
to
go
to
trial
on
the
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
tactics
involved
in
this
case?
was
there
any
reason
for
pleading
guilty
with
a
manslaughter
charge,
other
than
to
obtain
a
bar
to
the
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
only
reason,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
otherwise,
i
assume
you
would
have
asked
for
a
trial--
--right.
that
was
the
reason.
well,
mr.
purola,
to
the
extent
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
going
through
the
anxiety
of
twice
being
forced
to
go
to
trial,
it
seems
to
me
that
its
purpose
isn't
served
by
allowing
the
defendant
himself
to
force
entry
of
a
plea
and
avoid
not
only
two
bites
of
the
apple
by
the
state,
but
even
the
first
bite.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
point
is,
the
state
has
never
been
given
an
opportunity
for
even
a
single
trial,
and
the
defendant
has
been
in
the
position
of
himself
forcing
this
situation
and
asking
for
it.
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
how
the
policies
behind
the
double
jeopardy
clause
are
served
by
applying
it
in
these
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
justice
o'connor
suggested
that
the
judge
was
forced
to
accept
the
plea.
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
did
he
have
the
alternative
to
decline
to
accept
the
plea?
unknown
speaker
mr.
purola,
you
say
that
the
ultimate
acceptance
of
the
plea
and
judgment
entered
on
it
makes
it
just
like
our
other
cases
where
trial
and
conviction
or
conviction
on
a
lesser
offense
barred
conviction
on
a
greater
offense.
but
in
cases
like
brown
v.
ohio,
there
were
two
separate
proceedings
in
two
separate
ohio
counties,
weren't
there?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
that's...
it's
factually
different.
don't
you
think
it
might
be
legally
different;
that
here
there
was
all
one
indictment
before
one
judge?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
difference,
i
suppose,
is
that
the
state
did
have
an
opportunity
to
proceed
to
contest
a
judgement
in
at
least
one
of
its
count.
unknown
speaker
are
they
the
same
offense
as
murder?
unknown
speaker
the
same
offense
as
murder?
unknown
speaker
what
about
my
question?
are
they
the
same
as
murder?
unknown
speaker
he
was
charged
with
murder
here,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
i
inquired
of
your
friend...
and
perhaps
you
wish
to
address
it...
is
it
common
or
usual
or
frequent
practice
of
judges
to
do
what
the
judge
did
here,
accept
a
plea
on
a
relatively
minor
charge
and
foreclose
the
right
of
the
state
to
go
to
trial
on
the
major
charge?
unknown
speaker
not
that
you
won't
tender
a
plea
again?
unknown
speaker
if
the
case
had
gone
to
trial,
could
he
have
been
convicted
of
both
offenses?
if
you
have
both
of
those
instructions,
does
the
trial
judge
customarily
say
you
can
bring
in
a
guilty
verdict
of
both?
unknown
speaker
he
does?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean
just
the
involuntary
manslaughter
and
murder.
unknown
speaker
and
get
consecutive
sentences
for
the
two?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
jury
could
bring
in
a
verdict
on
both,
but
he
couldn't
enter
judgment
on
it.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
what
you
just
said
is
inconsistent
with
what
you
told
me
a
little
while
ago.
you're
saying
johnson
decided
this?
i
thought
you
told
me
the
judge
had
the
power
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
accept
the
plea.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
would
always
ask
for
the
lesser
offense.
he
wouldn't
have
ever
asked
for
murder
if
he
had
a
choice.
unknown
speaker
suppose
they
had
gone
to
trial.
suppose
the
judge
hadn't
engaged
in
this
extraordinary,
unprecedented
action
that
you
concede
was
just
that.
at
the
end
of
all
the
evidence,
does
the
ohio
judge
have
the
power
that's
common
generally
to
direct
a
verdict
on
the
murder
charge,
for
example,
and
leave
to
the
jury
the
decision
only
on
the
other
charges?
unknown
speaker
then
the
state
would
have
had
its
day
in
court,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
doubt
about
the
judge's
power
to
direct
a
verdict
on
the
grounds
that
the
evidence
would
not
support
the
verdict
of
murder.
unknown
speaker
it's
almost
instantaneous,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well,
you've
decided
the
whole
case
when
you
say
under
a
final
judgment.
it
didn't
dispose
of
the
entire
indictment,
though,
except...
unless
you
win
on
your
double
jeopardy
claim.
unknown
speaker
then
a
final
judgment,
wrapping
up
the
whole
case.
unknown
speaker
the
state's
position
is
that
there
is
no
valid
final
judgment
outstanding
now.
unknown
speaker
part
of
its
position.
unknown
speaker
he's
really
not
in
prison
is
what
he's
saying.
he
is
in
prison,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
so
there
must
be
a
valid
judgment,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
also,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
indicating
what
your
advice
was
to
your
client
when
you
advised
him
to
plead
guilty?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
discussion
then
about
whether
there
might
be
a
trial
on
the
more
serious
offense?
unknown
speaker
if
i
were
the
defendant,
i
would
wonder
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
other
count.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
at
the
time
of
his
plea?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
before
it.
but
his
plea
had
been
accepted
and
judgment
entered
before
he
ever
filed
a
motion.
unknown
speaker
you
want
some
credit
for
foresight,
i
would
think.
well,
fundamentally,
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
based
on
jeffers,
is
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
your
double
jeopardy
claim
because
you
elected
to
make
two
proceedings
out
it
rather
than
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
purola,
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
situation
immediately
before
the
guilty
plea
was
accepted?
as
a
matter
of
ohio
practice,
could
the
prosecution
have
dismissed
the
involuntary
manslaughter
charge
or
could
you
have
prevented
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
survived
up
until
1969
without...
or
'67...
without
ever
incorporating
the
double
jeopardy
provision
as
v.
the
states.
unknown
speaker
you
indicate
that
the
state
has
done
everything
it
could
have
done.
i
suppose
it
could
have
dismissed
the
two
charges
to
which...
with
respect
to
which
the
pleas
were
proffered.
and
then
you
would
have
your
murder
trial.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
have
dismissed,
then
went
to
trial
on
murder,
and
you
lost,
you
would
have
been
through.
unknown
speaker
you
would
have
been
through
entirely.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question?
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
and
there's
a
new
trial
and
you
convict
this
man
of
murder,
get
a
judgment
for
murder,
would
it
be
your
view
that
the
judgment
for
manslaughter
would
remain
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
have
both.
