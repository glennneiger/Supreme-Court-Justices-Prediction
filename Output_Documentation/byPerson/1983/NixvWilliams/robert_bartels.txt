mr.
robert
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
the
arguments
that
the
court
has
heard
the
past
couple
of
days
and
in
light
of
the
argument
by
the
petitioners
here
today,
i
think
i
should
start
by
saying
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
case,
nor
is
it
a
prophylactic
rule
case
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
area,
such
as
miranda
or
wade.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right,
your
honor.
it's
a
particular
kind
of
sixth
amendment
violation
as
well.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
in
all
of
these
cases
i
don't
think
it's
clear
that
the
state
would
not
have
had
the
evidence
otherwise,
and
the
court
has
never
looked
at
the
problem
in
that
way
before,
at
least.
we're
talking,
in
this
case
there
is
no
question
that
in
fact
the
evidence
that's
at
issue
here
was
obtained
as
a
direct
result
of
the
violation
of
the
respondent's
sixth
amendment
rights
during
an
interrogation.
detective
leaming
pursued
this
interrogation
which
this
court
has
previously
held
violated
his
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
the
government,
the
state,
conceded
even
at
the
motion
to
suppress
that,
following
mr.
williams
directions
after
that
interrogation,
the
police
uncovered
the
body.
mr.
robert
bartels
it
would
be
quite
different,
your
honor,
because
in
that
situation
the
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
rights
would
not
be
the
cause--
mr.
robert
bartels
--no,
your
honor,
in
fact
it's
not.
there
is...
and
i've
been
speaking
a
little
bit
loosely
when
i
say
that
there's
been
a
sixth
amendment
violation
during
interrogation.
as
this
court
has
held
in
weatherford
versus
bursey,
there
is
no
completed
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
rights
until
the
evidence
is
introduced
at
trial.
now,
what
that
means
is
that
the
very
core
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
during
interrogation
is
to
prevent
the
use
at
trial
of
evidence
that
has
been
obtained
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
there's
nothing
about...
the
word
"exclusion"
is
not
in
there.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor--
mr.
robert
bartels
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
that
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
his
defense.
the
theory
that
this
court
has
used
in
looking
at
massiah,
brewer
itself,
and,
i
think
perhaps
most
significantly
in
terms
of
what
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
means
in
this
context,
weatherford
versus
bursey,
has
said
that
what
it
means
in
this
context
when
we're
talking
about
a
pretrial
interference
with
the
relationship
between
attorney
and
client--
mr.
robert
bartels
--is
that
the
violation
occurs
when
the
evidence--
mr.
robert
bartels
--comes
in.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
have
not
had
a
chance
to
look
at
morrison,
which
wasn't
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs,
and
so
i
can
only
speak
from
my
recollection.
but
my
recollection
of
morrison
was
that
the
issue
was
whether
an
interference
with
communications
and
relationship
between
attorney
and
the
accused
was
going
to
result
in
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
and
what
this
court
said
was
that
sanction
was
not
necessary.
now,
that's
completely
consistent
with
the
view
that
what
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
pretrial
stages
is
all
about
is
to
protect
the
defendant
from
having
the
state
elicit
from
him
for
use
at
trial
some
evidence
without
his
having
the
assistance
of
a
lawyer
who
can
advise
him
about
the
consequences
of
giving
that
kind
of
information
and
his
rights
with
regard
to
giving
that
kind
of
information.
and
it's
the
use
at
trial
that
constitutes
the
completion,
at
least,
of
that
sixth
amendment
violation,
and
inherently
therefore
this
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
includes
an
exclusionary
rule.
it's
the
very
purpose
of
it.
now,
a
consequence
of
that
is
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
at
interrogation
is
not
to
deter
police
misconduct
in
the
future.
this
court
indicated
in
massiah
and
in
weatherford
that
there's
really
no
constitutional
violation
if
the
police
sit
the
defendant
down
and
interrogate
him
without
counsel.
that's
fine,
as
long
as
they
don't
use
it
against
him
at
trial.
so
there's
no
deterrent
purpose,
at
least
in
a
primary
sense,
and
consequently
the
deterrence
analysis
on
which
the
state
seeks
to
justify
the
hypothetical
probable
discovery
doctrine
here
is
really
beside
the
point.
mr.
robert
bartels
massiah,
brewer,
estelle
versus
smith,
united
states
versus
henry,
and
weatherford
versus
bursey.
mr.
robert
bartels
i
apologize
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
i'm
sorry
to
set
that
particular
record.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
really
fits
under
rule
35.5.
i
filed
that
brief
because,
out
of
inadvertence
and
my,
as
it
turned
out,
overblown
concern
with
the
page
limitation,
i
forgot
to
add
a
paragraph
or
actually
two
paragraphs
about
estelle
versus
smith.
i
thought
it
was
preferable--
mr.
robert
bartels
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
the
case.
i
was
well,
as
it
turned
out,
well
under
the
page
limitation
on
the
brief
in
the
merits.
my
feeling
was
that
it
did
not
make
sense
for
me
to
wait
'til
oral
argument
to
bring
up
a
case
that
i
believed
was
really
central
in
terms
of
the
precedents
of
this
court.
i
apologize
if
i
misinterpreted
the
rules
or
made
the
wrong
choice
in
that
regard.
the
position
that
the
respondent
takes
means
that
the
facts
in
this
case
that
matter
are
very
simple.
the
evidence
was
in
fact
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation
and
therefore
has
to
be
excluded,
given
the
core
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
at
interrogation.
however,
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
about
the
facts,
which
are
much
more
complicated,
concerning
the
hypothetical
question
of
whether
the
body
would
have
been
discovered
if
detective
leaming
had
not
engaged
in
this
conduct
that
violated
the
respondent's
sixth
amendment
rights.
however
one
might
want
to
resolve
the
disputes
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
about
what
the
record
shows
with
regard
to
probable
or
inevitable
discovery,
it
does
seem
clear
that
this
question
or
this
record
raises
many,
many
difficult
questions,
and
they
are
questions
which
can
in
the
end
only
be
resolved
by
resorting
to
surmise
and
to
the
post
hoc
rationalizations
of
the
police
officers.
and
if
i
may
speak
to
the
issue
that
came
up
during
my
opponent's
argument
about
the
scope
of
the
search.
the
only
evidence
that
we
have
that
the
search
would
have
continued
into
polk
county
is
the
testimony
of
agent
ruxlow,
who
was
in
charge
of
the
search.
now,
inherently
when
he
comes
into
court
some
years
later
and
says
that,
we
already
have
his
ability,
at
least,
to
say
what
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
you'd
have
two
choices.
one,
this
court
can
look
at
the
facts
itself
if
it
decides
to
adopt
a
hypothetical
probable
discovery
doctrine
and
if
it
gets
passed
the
good
faith-bad
faith
issue.
it
could
then
go
to
the
facts
and
resolve
them.
on
the
other
hand,
i
certainly
agree
with
the
government
that
a
remand
to
the
eighth
circuit
would
also
be
appropriate
to
resolve
those
factual
questions,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
more
appropriate
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
address
those
factual
issues
because
of
its
disposition
and
because
it
also
has
pending
seven
or
eight
other
issues
that
may
also
determine
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
think
it's
within
this
court's
power
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
on
any
ground
that's
been
discussed
and
litigated.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
let
me
comment
about
at
least
the
state
court
findings
of
fact,
which
normally
would
be
afforded
a
presumption
of
correctness
under
section
2254(d).
in
this
case
one
thing
that's
quite
clear
is
that
the
state
courts
relied
very
heavily
on
their
findings
with
regard
to
the
visibility
of
the
culvert
and
the
visibility
of
the
body
on
exhibit
d,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
as
i
recall
at
page
108.
it's
a
picture
of
the
body.
detective
or
agent
ruxlow
testified
that
that
picture
showed
the
body
as
it
was
found,
and
it's
clear
from
the
opinions
of
both
state
courts
that
they
accepted
that
testimony
as
such
and
relied
on
it.
at
the
habeas
hearing,
the
attorneys
representing
the
petitioner
discovered
another
photograph
which
showed
beyond
any
doubt...
this
is
exhibit
1...
that
exhibit
d
did
not
show
the
body
as
it
was
found
and
that
agent
ruxlow
had
testified
falsely,
and
agent
ruxlow
admitted
in
his
deposition
that
exhibit
d
did
not
show
the
body
as
it
was
found.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
under
section
2254(d)(3)
and
(6).
mr.
robert
bartels
there
was
not
an
adequate
development
of
the
factual
matter.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
if
that
relevant
piece
of
evidence
discloses
not
just
something
new,
but
that
the
state
court
relied
on
an
inaccurate
and
misleading
version
of
the
facts
presented
by
the
state,
that
would
seem
classically
a
case
where
the
petitioner
did
not
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
that
factual
issue
in
the
state
court.
and
i
would
note
that
the
state
has
made
no
argument
here,
at
least
in
its
briefs,
that
the
presumption
under
2254(d)
applies
in
this
case
to
the--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
the
habeas
court
concluded,
without
much
explanation,
that
the
new
evidence
added
little
and
detracted
little
from
what
was
before
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
district
court's
treatment
of
that--
mr.
robert
bartels
--only
if
the
district
court's
conclusion
was
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
we
would
be
asking--
mr.
robert
bartels
--either
this
court
or
the
eighth
circuit
to
review.
mr.
robert
bartels
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
scope
of
the
search.
we
have
ruxlow's
testimony,
ruxlow
that
was
told
what
this
hearing
was
about
before
he
testified.
he
was
told
they
needed
his
testimony
to
show
that
his
search
would
have
produced
the
body.
he
testified
falsely
about
exhibit
d,
and
his
testimony
that
the
search
would
have
continued
into
polk
county
is
inconsistent
with
all
of
the
historical
facts
that
we
have
about
what
happened.
agent
ruxlow's
report
about
his
search
effort
says
that
he
was
to
search
poweshiek
and
jasper
counties.
it
never
even
mentions
polk
county.
the
search
proceeded
exactly
to
the
jasper-polk
county
border
and
then
ruxlow
abandoned
it,
with
three
hours
of
daylight
left,
with
all
of
the
searchers
assembled,
he
admitted
for
no
purpose
known
to
him
except
to
follow
detective
leaming
and,
as
he
finally
admitted,
well
before
mr.
williams
indicated
that
he
would
take
the
police
to
the
body.
if
he
planned
to
go
into
polk
county
with
this
search,
why
not
at
3:00
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
on
december
26th
when
all
of
the
searchers
were
assembled?
now,
my
point
is
that
there
are
serious
questions
raised
about
this,
and
it
illustrates
one
of
the
difficulties,
one
of
the
practical,
pragmatic
difficulties
with
the
so-called
inevitable
discovery
doctrine,
and
that
is
that
one
ends
up
having
to
resolve
hypothetical
disputes
on
the
basis
of
post
hoc
rationalization
and
when
the
state
can
effectively
call
an
officer
in
and
have
him
say
what
would
have
happened
because
by
and
large
historical
facts
don't
stand
in
the
way.
that
brings
me,
unless
there
are
other
questions
on
the
merits,
to
the
stone
versus
powell
issue.
again,
the
sixth
amendment
nature
of
this
case
provides
the
clearest,
most
efficient
route
to
a
decision
on
that
issue.
stone
versus
powell
was
a
fourth
amendment
decision
and
the
analysis
of
the
court
in
that
case
was
based
entirely
on
the
deterrent
effect,
the
deterrent
function
i
should
say,
of
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule.
the
court
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
a
decision
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
generally.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
that
discussion
about
the
probative
value
was
really
part
of
the
discussion
of
the
social
cost
of
excluding
evidence,
which
is
a
part
of
a
balancing
analysis
that
one
gets
into
in
the
fourth
amendment
area,
where
we're
talking
about
the
degree
of
deterrence
that
we'll
get
as
opposed
to
social
costs.
it
doesn't
become
relevant
when
we're
dealing
with--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
in
this
case
it's
because,
at
least
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
in
past
cases,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
already
made...
did
that
balancing.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
one
looks
at
what
the
function
of
the
right
to
counsel
would
be
in
an
interrogation
context,
it
would
be
to
prevent
the
police
from
accomplishing
what
they
are
after,
which
is
to
elicit
information
and
then
use
it
at
trial,
without
interposing--
mr.
robert
bartels
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
because
there
is
no
balancing
in
this
particular
area
of
the
sixth
amendment,
not
only
do
we
not
have
a
hypothetical
probable
discovery
doctrine,
but
stone
versus
powell
doesn't
apply.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
what
we
would
mean
by
"bound
to
be
discovered".
mr.
robert
bartels
if
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
situation,
we
can
never
know
for
sure.
now,
we
might
know--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
in
that
case
they
have
actually
found
the
body--
mr.
robert
bartels
--by
legal
means.
mr.
robert
bartels
not
yet,
your
honor,
because
they
haven't--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
if
that
were
the
case
this
court
would
have
decided
weatherford
versus
bursey
differently.
the
completed
violation
doesn't
occur
until
the
evidence
is
introduced
at
trial.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
in
the
fourth
amendment
i
don't
think
we
do
have
a
situation
where
the
admission
of
the
evidence
is
the
violation
itself.
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
rights
of
privacy
wholly
outside
the
judicial
process
and,
at
least
as
this
court
has
interpreted
and
defended
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
in
recent
cases,
including
stone
versus
powell,
the
sole
justification
for
that
sanction,
for
that
exclusionary
rule,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fairness
or
integrity
of
the
trial.
it
has
solely
to
do
with
deterring
future
police
misconduct
outside
the
trial
process,
in
people's
homes.
on
the
other
hand,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
precisely
designed
to
protect
rights
of
defendants
at
trial
and
at
the
critical
stages
of
the
process
leading
up
to
trial,
but
everything
focusing
on
what's
going
to
happen
at
the
trial,
whether
it's
going
to
be
fair.
and
even
though
we
may
be
dealing
with
probative
evidence
that's
being
kept
out,
one
of
our
fundamental
principles
is
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
make
the
adversary
process
fair
so
that
he
is
not
put
at
an
unfair
advantage
as
opposed
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
problem
with
characterizing
this
as
an
independent
source
case
is
that
there
is
no
independent
source,
and
that's
why--
mr.
robert
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
real
dispute
about
that
in
this
case.
the
reason
why
the
state
comes
to
this
court
and
asks
for
an
inevitable
discovery
exception
is
that
the
independent
source
exception
doesn't
work.
with
an
independent
source,
you
actually
have
an
independent
source
which
brought
about
in
fact
the
evidence
in
question.
that's
unquestionably
not
the
case
here.
the
ruxlow
search,
whatever
might
have
happened,
in
fact
did
not
produce
that
evidence.
there
is
no
independent
actual
lawful
source
for
that
evidence.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
don't
have
any
questions
but
what
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
hypothetical
probable
discovery
or
inevitable
discovery
doctrine,
that
we're
dealing
with
a
question
that
is
not...
certainly
not
one
of
law.
it's
perhaps
one
of
fact.
it's
kind
of
funny
fact,
because
we're
talking
about
by
definition
facts
that
have
never
occurred
and
that
we--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
it
is,
these
sorts
of
questions
are
unknown,
when
we're
talking
about
the
concept
of
causation
in
terms
of
the
causal
connection
between
the
violation
and
the
evidence
in
question.
at
least
in
situations
like
this
when
we're
dealing
with
one
actual
cause
and
one
merely
potential
that
didn't
actually
happen,
the
but-for
cause
doesn't
work,
and
for
that
reason
the
law
of
torts
and
criminal
law
both
have
adopted
a
different
test,
and
that
is
the
material
element
and
substantial
factor
test.
mr.
robert
bartels
inevitable
discovery,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
attenuation
doctrine,
although
it
has
by
and
large
been
defended
on
deterrence
grounds,
i
think
fits
the
standard
notion
of--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
lead
pipe
cinch
even
in
that
situation.
and
i
would
say,
that's
a
far
different
case
from
this
one.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
involved.
mr.
robert
bartels
fourteen.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
that's
a
point
that
was
raised
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
mr.
robert
bartels
and
i
address
that
point--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
i
think
that
at
this
point--
mr.
robert
bartels
--your
honor,
there
would
be,
but
that
assumes
that
the
question
of
guilt
and
innocence
is
so
clear.
i
think
the
last
time
around--
mr.
robert
bartels
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
i
address
that
point
at
the
end--
mr.
robert
bartels
--well,
your
honor,
the
eighth
circuit
explicitly
discussed
some
of
the
evidence
that
pointed
toward
the
innocence
of
mr.
williams,
and
i
have
discussed
some
more
of
it
at
the
end
of
respondent's
brief
in
response
to
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
this
time
around,
your
honor...
the
last
time
the
defense
didn't
have
some
of
the
evidence
that
existed
in
the
police
files.
this
time
around
they
got
it.
mr.
robert
bartels
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
theory
is
supported
by
some
evidence
that
mr.
williams
has
no
control
over.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
there
is
always
a
social
cost,
and
believe
me,
i
know
about
it.
fifteen
years
i
have
been
on
the
same
case.
[laughter]
a
private
cost
as
well.
but
certainly
the
first
several
years
of
those
costs
are
attributable
to
the
fact
that
the
state
introduced
this
evidence
in
violation
of
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights.
and
if
it
had
not
done
so,
and
if
this
court
were
to
decide--
mr.
robert
bartels
--not
this
time,
your
honor.
but
if
this
court
were
to
decide
the
merits
in
that
way,
then
i
think
we'd
have
the
same
argument.
mr.
robert
bartels
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
my
sixth
amendment
theory,
as
it
should,
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
is
really
unnecessary.
the
court
of
appeals
was
trying
to
avoid--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
turns
on
one's
conclusion
about
whether
detective
leaming
was
acting
in
good
faith.
the
sixth
amendment
analysis
that's
outlined
in
pages
4
through
8
of
the
respondent's
brief
does
not
address
that
question.
the
only
question
is
was
this
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
rights.
thank
you.
