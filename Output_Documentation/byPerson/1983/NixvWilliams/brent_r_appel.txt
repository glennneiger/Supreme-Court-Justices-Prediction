mr.
brent
r.
appel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
second
time
this
case
has
been
here,
and
so
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
the
underlying
facts.
but
this
time
it
comes
here
in
a
very
different
analytical
posture.
in
the
first
case,
as
you
recall,
highly
probative
testimony
about
the
fact
that
the
witness
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car
made
incriminating
statements
that
ultimately
led
police
to
the
body
of
a
murder
victim
was
suppressed
on
the
ground
that
the
respondent's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
was
violated.
after
this
court
set
aside
the
first
conviction,
respondent
was
retried
and
this
time
medical
testimony
about
the
fact
of
the
body's
discovery,
the
fact
that
the
body
was
dead,
and
the
fact
that
the
body
showed
evidence
of
sexual
abuse,
and
the
fact
that
the
body
appeared
to
have
been
suffocated
was
introduced
in
the
record
on
an
inevitable
discovery
theory.
and
the
state
believes
that
in
this
particular
case
if
the
court
keeps
focus
on
the
fact
that
this
is
an
independent
source
case
with
a
twist,
the
twist
of
inevitable
discovery,
it's
readily
disposed
of
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
it
is
not
an
attenuation
case.
it
is
not
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
it
is
emphatically
not
an
attempt
to
relitigate
williams
i.
let's
review
the
facts
on
williams
ii.
inevitable
discovery
is
the
exception
used
to
admit
the
evidence.
200
volunteers
were
sweeping
across
an
area
in
central
iowa,
looking
in
ditches
along
interstate
80
for
the
body
of
the
murder
victim.
it's
in
the
record
under
detective
ruxlow's
testimony
exactly
what
the
contours
of
this
search
were.
but
the
volunteers
were
expressly
directed
to
look
in
hidden
parts
of
ditches
for
the
body.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
flatly
to
the
contrary.
detective
ruxlow,
who
was
in
charge
of
the
search,
stated
that
the
search
was
going
to
continue
into
polk
county.
and
that
makes
logical
sense.
if
the
body
had
not
been
discovered
and
the
search
had
already
continued
for
a
period
of
60
miles,
7
miles
north
and
7
miles
south
of
the
interstate,
they
surely
would
have
continued
the
search
on
into
the
ymca,
which
is
where
the
abduction
ultimately
occurred.
the
trial
court--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--the
court
of
appeals
did
not--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--the
court
of
appeals
introduced
an
absence
of
bad
faith
theory
into
the
case
and
reversed
on
that
ground.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
submit--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
the
state
failed
to--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
correct.
and
i
submit
to
you,
because
this
is
an
independent
source
case,
that
good
faith
is
not
an
issue.
in
fact,
this
search
is
analytically
entirely
distinct
from
the
conduct
that
occurred
in
the
automobile
as
the
respondent
was
transported
from
davenport
to
des
moines.
now,
we've
had
suggestions
in
respondent's
brief
that
a
sixth
amendment
claim
is
involved
here.
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
the
ability
of
the
respondent
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
at
trial
who
testified
with
respect
to
the
medical
condition
of
the
body
was
fully
protected.
in
fact,
if
you
glance
at
the
trial
record
you'll
see
not
only
was
there
rigorous
cross-examination
of
the
coroner
who
testified
about
the
condition
of
the
body,
but
the
defense
introduced
three
medical
witnesses
to
attempt
to
build
a
case
in
a
different
direction
from
that
of
the
state.
and
to
show
that
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
violation
independently
here
in
the
admission
of
medical
testimony,
i
submit
to
you
the
following
hypothetical.
supposing
an
attorney
was
traveling
in
the
car
with
respondent
and
fully
protecting
his
rights
under
miranda,
fifth
amendment
rights
and
so
forth.
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference.
three
courts
that
have
considered
the
matter...
the
state
trial
court,
the
iowa
supreme
court,
which
reviews
constitutional
issues
de
novo,
and
the
federal
district
court...
have
said
that
the
body
would
have
been
discovered
in
any
event.
indeed,
if
respondent
was
still
at
large
the
body
would
have
been
discovered
in
any
event,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
three
courts
that
have
considered
the
matter.
and
so
i
submit
to
you
that
the
right
to
counsel
has
been
fully
protected
in
this
case,
and
that
the
only
rationale
for
exclusion
of
this
highly
probative
and
reliable
evidence
must
be
found
really
elsewhere;
perhaps
some
generalized
notion
of
protection
of
the
adversary
process.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
basically
says,
if
i
can
characterize
it
correctly,
that
in
order
to
invoke
inevitable
discovery
the
state
has
the
burden
of
showing
absence
of
bad
faith.
then
the
eighth
circuit
said:
look,
in
massiah,
in
the
massiah
analysis,
we
look
to
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officer,
and
that
is
whether
the
officer
intended
to
elicit
information
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
and
therefore
we
must
reverse.
it
was
almost
a
collateral
estoppel
theory,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
implication
is
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
right,
because
the
first,
the
original
case
was--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
let
me
point
out
that
the
inevitable
discovery
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule...
when
there
is
an
independent
ongoing
investigation
substantial
in
character
that's
on
the
verge
of
the
discovery
of
the
body,
good
faith
is
irrelevant.
let
me
suggest
to
you,
for
instance,
the--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
the
key
testimony
in
the
record
is
from
detective
ruxlow.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
there's
an
express
factual
finding
that
the
body
would
have
been
discovered
in
any
event.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that
a
search
had
been
initiated,
that
it
involved
some
200
volunteers,
that
the
search
method
was
traveling
along
interstate
80
7
miles
north
and
south
of
interstate
80,
looking
in
the
ditches,
looking
at
places
where
"a
body
might
be
secreted".
the
searchers
were
traveling
in
automobiles
and
snowmobiles,
with
specific
direction
to
go
down
and
look
in
ditches
or
any
area
that
might
be
weeded,
and
so
forth.
the
body
in
fact
was
found
about
two
and
a
half
miles
in
front
of
the
search
where
the
search
had
been
discontinued.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct.
now,
admittedly
we
can't
tell
this
with
mathematical
precision
because
we
can't
remake
history,
but
that's
not
unusual
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
for
instance,
take
the
wade-gilbert-stovall
trilogy.
a
pretrial
identification
has
occurred
and
there's
nothing
we
can
do
to
back
up
and
undo
the
transaction.
but
instead,
we
allow
independent
testimony
in
court
not
based
on
the
tainted
identification.
there's
no
psychological
laser
that
can
beam
that
out
of
the
mind
of
the
witness.
similarly
in
the
franks
v.
delaware
context,
where
we
allow...
we
examine
a
search
warrant
where
there's
been
perjured
or
false
information
in
a
search
warrant.
we
attempt
to...
we
can't
reconstruct
the
transaction.
we
can't
tell
for
sure
whether
a
federal
magistrate
would
have
issued
a
warrant
with
the
faulty
material
excised.
but
we
make
a
judgment.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
in
this
court's
precedents
that
the
mere
fact
you
can't
show
mathematical
certainty
ought
not
defeat
the
position
of
the
state.
i
want
to
contrast
this
case
sharply
with
the
dunaway
type
situation.
in
dunaway,
as
you
recall,
you
have
a
situation
where
there's
no
probable
cause
to
arrest,
admittedly.
the
police
say
they
don't.
they
pick
up
a
person
suspected
of
a
robbery
and
murder,
read
that
person
miranda
rights
in
the
hope
to
cleanse
the
transaction,
to
see
what
might
drop
out.
the
court
in
dunaway
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
specific
bootstrap,
that
they
went
out,
they
arrested
the
person
without
probable
cause
with
a
view
to
trying
to
cleanse
the
transaction
with
miranda
and
seeing
if
evidence
could
be
garnered.
that
is
emphatically
not
the
case
here.
in
dunaway
there's
a
possibility
of
an
inducement
for
illegal
conduct
because,
number
one,
all
of
the
variables
of
the
transaction
are
within
the
control
of
the
infracting
officer,
and
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
here
we
have
an
independent
source.
it's
a
question
of
timing.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
not
where
there
is
an
independent
ongoing
investigation,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
is
analytically
distinct
from
the
underlying
infraction.
again,
at
the
risk
of
repetition,
no
matter
what
happened
in
that
car,
even
if
the
most
able
legal
strategist
had
been
traveling
in
the
car
from
davenport,
davenport
to
des
moines,
iowa,
the
body
would
have
been
discovered
in
any
event.
that
is
not
and
the
dunaway
case
is
the
heads
we
tie,
tails
we
tie...
or
heads
we
win,
tails
we
tie,
proposition
that
the
respondent
suggests;
the
police
will
not
be
worse
off
for
it.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
we
go
further
than
that
in
this
particular
case.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
here
you
have
an
actual
substantial
ongoing
investigation
that's
on
the
verge
of
recovering
the
body.
it
is
not
really
a
hypothetical.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right,
it
does
assume
the
conclusion.
but
i
want
to
contrast
this
to
one
of
those
hypothetical
routine
police
investigations
where
there
is
no
independent
ongoing
investigation.
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
there
would
have
been
a
search
for
pamela
powers.
so
it's
not
quite
the
same
as
routinely
projecting
hypothetical,
well,
the
police
would
have
investigated
because
police
are
generally
thorough,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
this
is
far
less
speculative
than
that
context.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think
the
state
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
the
body
would
have
been
found
in
any
event.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that
would
be
more
than
enough.
what
are
the
consequences
in
this
particular
transaction,
looking
at
the
burden
of
proof?
supposing
we
err...
just
thinking
abstractly,
supposing
you
err
in
the
determination
of
whether
the
body
would
have
been
inevitably
discovered
and
you
exclude
evidence
that
in
fact
would
have
been
found
by
police,
though
we
can't
prove
it.
that
amounts
to
a
penalty
on
law
enforcement.
all
the
petitioner
asks
here
is
to
put
law
enforcement
back
in
the
status
quo
before
the
unconstitutional
violation
occurred.
this
court
has
never
applied
the
exclusionary
rule,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
in
a
context
that
in
fact
puts
law
enforcement
in
a
position
that's
worse
off.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
michigan
v.
tucker
is
entirely
instructive
in
that
particular
point.
in
michigan
and
tucker,
as
you
know,
there
was
a
miranda
warning
that
was
defective.
it
was
defective
in
the
sense
that
the
accused
was
not
informed
of
the
right
to
counsel
should
he
be
indigent,
and
various
incriminating
statements
were
obtained
from
the
accused.
in
that
case
this
court
held,
number
one,
the
right
to
counsel
was
not
infracted.
why?
because
when
hennessey
appeared
in
a
court
of
law
his
attorney
was
able
to
fully
cross-examine
the
derivative
evidence.
number
two,
in
michigan
v.
tucker
it
was
said,
since
the
direct
evidence
was
suppressed,
i.e.
the
fact
that
the
witness
made
the
statements,
that
was
sufficient
deterrence.
the
marginal
deterrence
that
might
have
been
obtained
was
certainly
not
worth
the
candle.
in
this
particular
case,
evidence
of
the
most
highly
probative
character,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
actually
led
police
to
the
body
and
therefore
knew
personally
of
the
whereabouts,
has
already
been
suppressed.
no
additional
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
has
been
infracted.
this
is
not
an
attenuation
case.
we
hear
in
the
respondent's
brief
citations
to
brown
v.
illinois
and
to
dunaway.
again,
this
is
an
independent
source
case,
with
a
bit
of
a
twist.
this
court
has
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
hold
that
inevitable
discovery
applies
in
a
context
where
an
independent
investigation
is
on
the
verge
of
discovery,
though
in
crews
v.
united
states,
part
d
of
the
opinion,
that
three
justices
signed,
we
come
very
close
where
the
three
justices
note
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
identification
of
the
accused
was
made
through
an
illegal
arrest,
there
was
already
an
ongoing
investigation
and
it
had
focused
on
the
suspect,
who
was
down
at
the
washington
monument,
and
the
evidence
was
within
the
grasp
of
police.
in
the
attenuation
cases
it's
like
dominoes.
there
is
causation.
there's
no
independent
ongoing
investigation.
and
at
some
stage
we
say,
hey,
there's
too
many
dominoes,
50
dominoes,
100
dominoes,
and
it
gets
too
far
down
the
line
to
say
that
the
evidence
was
obtained
at
exploitation
of
the
underlying
conduct.
and
probably
where
there's
a
live
witness
involved
that
counts
for
50
dominoes.
but
in
this
particular
case,
once
again,
law
enforcement
does
not
have
the
ability
to
manipulate
the
variables
like
you
might
in
an
attenuation
case,
like
in
dunaway.
it
would
be
an
odd
rule
of
law
that
said,
well,
go
ahead
and
arrest
without
probable
cause,
cleanse
it
with
miranda
and
then
see
what
drops
out.
that
might
be
an
incentive
for
unlawful
conduct.
but
that
is
emphatically
not
the
case
here.
one
other
case
that
this
is
not.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
precisely,
and
that
should
be
the
end
of...
that's
the
end
of
it.
this
is
an
independent
source
rule
case.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
and
that
is
a
matter
for
the
trial
court
to
find,
much
as
in
an
independent
source
case,
much
as
in
a
kastigar
type
case,
where
use
immunity
has
been
conferred
and
then
the
prosecution
comes
in
and
proves
in
a
court
of
law
the
independent
character
of
the
evidence.
so
i
think
it's
very
clear,
as
we
focus
on
this
particular
case,
that
what
occurred
in
williams
i
is
not
relevant.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
independent
source
here.
now,
i
want
to
contrast
once
again
our
setting
with
another
setting
that
may
be
causing
the
justices
some
difficulty,
and
that's
griffin
v.
united
states,
the
circuit
court
case
cited
in
the
brief.
what
basically
griffin
is
concerned
about
is
a
search
warrant
setting,
where
an
officer
is
at
the
door
without
a
warrant,
no
exigent
circumstances
are
present
justifying
immediate
entry,
and
says:
aha,
we
need
to
get
a
warrant.
i've
got
probable
cause,
i
know
i've
got
probable
cause.
if
the
rule
of
law
was
that
i
could
break
in
and
enter
this
establishment
without
a
warrant
and
then
later
come
into
a
court
in
a
bootstrap
fashion
and
say,
hey,
we
had
probable
cause,
it
would
have
been
inevitably
discovered,
once
again
that
would
threaten
to
eviscerate
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
requirements.
but
in
that
particular
case
there
is
no
independent
avenue
of
discovery
of
the
evidence
and
all
the
variables
are
within
the
control
of
the
officer
on
site.
and
so
i
would
sharply
distinguish
both
dunaway
and
the
griffin
type
situation
from
the
present
case
at
bar.
now,
i
think
it's
clear
that
there
is
a
sense
that
the
courts,
the
trial
courts,
are
going
to
have
to
make
a
factual
determination
here.
once
again,
that
is
not
unusual.
since
the
very
days
of
the
independent
source
rule,
since
silverthorne,
courts
have
time
in
and
time
out
been
making
the
determination
of
independent
source.
and
i
might
add,
in
silverthorne,
the
search
there
was
made
without
apparent
authority,
and
i
would
substitute
a
word
for
that:
flagrant.
it
was
wrong.
we
don't
have
much
of
the
facts
of
silverthorne
admittedly,
but
justice
holmes
simply
says
it
was
without
apparent
authority.
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
good
faith
is
not
relevant
in
that
setting.
another
case
that
i
want
to
cite...
this
is...
what
i'm
asking
for
is
simply
weaving
together
the
traditional
strands
of
this
court's
precedents.
though
the
court
hasn't
had
an
opportunity
to
expressly
embrace
inevitable
discovery,
it's
entirely
consistent.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
hopefully
today
we
get
some.
ceccolini.
the
search
is
blatantly
unconstitutional.
recall,
patrolman
burrow
just
happens
to
be
in
the
flower
shop
and
is
waiting
for
a
friend
and
is
fiddling
around
and
opens
up
an
envelope
and
there
are
policy
slips
in
it.
clearly
no
constitutional
justification.
but
there
was
no
intent
in
ceccolini
to
circumvent
the
law
in
a
michigan-tucker-like
setting:
oh,
we'll
go
out
and
pick
him
up
without
probable
cause,
read
him
miranda
and
cleanse
the
transaction.
nor
was
it
a
setting
like
in
the
search
and
seizure
context,
where
we
might
say,
well,
we're
going
to
break
in
anyway
and
then
we're
later
going
to
say,
well,
we
could
have
had
probable
cause.
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
in
fact,
analytically
speaking,
the
conduct
in
the
car
could
have
been
very
flagrant
indeed
and
it
would
not
be
relevant.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
unless
there's
further
questions
i
would
reserve
time
for
rebuttal
and
introduce
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
mr.
chief
justice:
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
we
would
have
to
rewrite
a
number
of
the
cases
in
order
to
sustain
petitioner's
position.
michigan
v.
tucker,
where
it
was
held
that
the
testimony
from
the
additional
witness
found
did
not
violate
sixth
amendment
rights
because
of
the
full
possibility
to
cross-examine,
is
a
case
involved.
the
court
would
do
well
to
recognize
justice
frankfurter's
admonition
that
facts
do
not
become
sacred
and
inaccessible
simply
because
of
underlying
conduct.
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
violation
here
from
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
where
the
respondent's
counsel's
role
as
legal
strategist,
as
discussed
in
the
ashe
case,
is
fully
preserved,
as
it
has
been
here,
and
as
a
result
the
admission
of
testimony
about
the
body
was
a
hard
blow,
but
not
a
constitutionally
foul
one.
and
in
closing,
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
where
a
police
officer
can
manipulate
the
law,
i.e.,
cleanse
an
illegal
transaction
with
miranda
in
order
to
obtain
some
kind
of
collateral
purpose.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case,
if
you
sustain
the
petitioner's
position,
that
will
provide
some
kind
of
inducement
for
law
enforcement
to
substitute
brawn
for
brains
as
a
key
instrumentality
of
crime
detection.
for
the
above
reasons,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
must
be
reversed.
