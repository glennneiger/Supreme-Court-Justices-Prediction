unknown
speaker
is
it
true,
as
the
respondent
states,
that
the
scope
of
the
search
was
to
stop
at
the
county
line?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disagree
with
that,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
he
found
on
another
theory.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
it
assumed
that
even
if
it
would
have
been
found,
it
was
inadmissible
because
of
the
faith,
bad
faith.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
all
that's
in
issue
before
us,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
specific
right
of
the
respondent
did
the
eighth
circuit
find
was
violated?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
say
what
right
of
the
respondent,
what
constitutional
right
had
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
did
spell
it
out,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
what
was
the
evidence
upon
which
it
was
said
that
discovery
was
inevitable
here?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
you
mentioned
that
all
three
courts
below,
the
federal
court
and
the
two
state
courts,
had
found
that.
were
there
findings?
are
there
findings?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
evidence
upon
which
that
conclusion
was
based?
unknown
speaker
after
he
pointed
out
where
it
was.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
your
point
is
that
the
evidence
said
they
were
patrolling
that
whole
area;
they'd
have
come
upon
this
particular
spot
where
the
body
was,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
or
are
you
suggesting
or
conceding,
then,
that
good
faith
really
after
all
is
a
factor
in
inevitability?
unknown
speaker
going
back
to
the
inevitability
of
the
discovery
of
this
child's
body,
would
you
say
that...
you've
already
said
that
this
doesn't
require
mathematical
or
scientific
certainty.
would
you
say
that
the
standard
is
something
like
one
used
in
other
areas,
that
it's
reasonable
probability
based
on
common
human
experience?
unknown
speaker
that
assumes
the
conclusion,
when
you
say
it's
"on
the
verge".
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
that
standard,
reasonable
probability
based
on
common
human
experience?
unknown
speaker
reasonable
probability
would--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
because
nothing
in
the
directions
for
the
search
or
the
scope
of
it
was
based
on
any
response
that
the
respondent
made
during
the
interrogation,
it's
just
not...
there's
just
no
causal
connection?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not...
you
could
still
decide
that
you've
launched
all
this
search
ahead
of
time
and
the
search
wasn't
designed
based
on
anything
that
he
might
have
said,
but
nevertheless
the
search
would
never
have
found
him.
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
just
needed
leadership.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
if
we
agree
with
you?
just
say
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
remand?
we
don't
have
to...
do
we
have
to
say
that...
do
we
have
to
say
there
was
inevitable
discovery?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
review
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
so
obvious
maybe
we
ought
to
remand.
unknown
speaker
another
five
years.
unknown
speaker
but
another
five
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a...
do
you
think
this
good
faith
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
seized
on
is
a
question
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
like
intent?
there's
nothing
subjective
about
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
wrong
standard
in
disagreeing
with
the
iowa
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
good
faith
is
an
element
of
inevitable
discovery
in
iowa?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
wrong
under
iowa
law.
unknown
speaker
the
eighth
circuit
doesn't
review
iowa
law
and
we
don't
review
iowa
law.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
what
the...
you
think
that
the...
well,
what
standard,
what
erroneous
standard
did
the
court
of
appeals
use?
unknown
speaker
so
they're
doubly
wrong.
if
good
faith
is
an
element
they
used
the
wrong
standard,
but
the
fact
is
it
isn't
an
element
at
all?
unknown
speaker
the
state
argued,
at
least
here,
the
stone,
the
extension
of
stone
versus
powell.
your
office
takes
no
position?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position,
that
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
is
it
on
that
ground,
that
it
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
therefore
this
is
not
a
remedy
problem,
that
the
very
introduction
of
the
evidence
was
itself
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bartels,
the
massiah
type
of
sixth
amendment
violation
produces
a
different
result,
doesn't
it,
than
almost
any
other
type
of
sixth
amendment
violation?
the
typical
right
to
counsel
violation
occurs
at
trial
or
has
something
to
do
with
what's
produced
for
a
trial,
but
massiah
results
in
discovering
of
evidence
that
the
state
wouldn't
have
had
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
violation.
why
shouldn't
that
be
treated
the
same
way
that
other
violations
of
constitutional
rights
which
produce
evidence
that
the
prosecution
wouldn't
have
had
be
treated,
such
as
the
fourth
amendment
or
miranda?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if,
mr.
bartels,
the
same
confession
or
testimony,
if
you
want
to
have
it
that
way,
had
been
elicited
from
mr.
williams
that
had
been
elicited,
but
maybe
half
an
hour
after
the
testimony
was
elicited
but
before
they
returned
to
des
moines,
williams
and
the
officer,
the
body
was
found
by
the
searching
party?
now,
your
case,
even
under
your
theory,
would
be
quite
different
then?
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
it's
exactly
the
same
violation.
unknown
speaker
can
you
find
that
compulsion
to
exclude
at
trial
in
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
itself?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
it?
unknown
speaker
because
i
gather
your
argument
is
if
there's
been
a
sixth
amendment
violation
which
resulted
in
obtaining
of
the
evidence,
that
the
sixth
amendment
itself
compels
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
where
do
you
find
that
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree--
unknown
speaker
--is
admitted.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
ms.
oberly's
argument
that
morrison
has
at
least
some
language
contrary
to
that
position?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
what
decisions
of
ours
you
rely
on
primarily
for
your
sixth
amendment
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartels,
as
you
have
mentioned
estelle
against
smith,
you
have
filed
two
supplemental
briefs
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
frankly,
i've
never
seen
that
many
since
i've
been
here.
unknown
speaker
the
first
one
says
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
discuss
estelle
against
smith,
which
should
have
been
included
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
is
that
in
line
with
our
rules?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
one
way
of
getting
around
the
page
limitation.
and
i
just
wondered,
can
this
go
on
forever?
unknown
speaker
under
what
heading
do
you
argue
this,
mr.
bartels?
you
didn't
cross-petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
we
disagreed
with
the
factual
conclusion
of
the
courts
other
than
the
eighth
circuit
that
discovery
would
have
been
inevitable
here,
the
judgment...
but
held
for
you
on
the
rest...
rather,
held
against
you,
do
you
think
the
same
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit...
we
wouldn't
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
it's
actually
likely...
and
of
course,
you're
as
able
to
predict
the
reactions
of
me
and
my
colleagues
as
i
am,
i
suppose...
that
the
court
would
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
grounds
that...
on
an
issue
on
which
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
pass,
the
inevitability
of
the
discovery,
on
which
other
lower
courts
have
found
discovery
would
have
been
inevitable,
we
would
make
our
own
findings
of
fact
and
say,
no,
discovery
would
not
be
inevitable?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
habeas
court
was
entitled
to
have
a
hearing
and
redetermine
that
question
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
under
what
provision?
unknown
speaker
(3)
and
(6).
unknown
speaker
as
soon
as
you
discover
a
piece
of
evidence,
relevant
piece
of
evidence,
you
have
a
new
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event
what
did
the
habeas
court
conclude?
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
a
fair
conclusion
in
the
state
court,
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
right
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in
stone
versus
powell
the
court
also
said
that
it
was
concerned
that
very
probative,
trustworthy
evidence
was
being
excluded
as
a
result
of
the
invocation
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
certainly
that
part
would
carry
over
to
this
case,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
social
cost
always
relevant
when
we're
talking
about
what
remedy
we
assign
for
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
how
were
we
able
to
figure
that
out?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
this
get
back,
mr.
bartels,
to
what
i
think
you
said
to
me
earlier,
that
really
your
major
argument
here
today
is
that
the
very
admission
of
this
evidence
violated
the
sixth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
only
way
you
can
correct
that
is
simply
not
allow
it
to
be
admitted?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
get
into
any
balancing
or
anything
else;
isn't
that
your--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
it
was
bound
to
be
discovered,
the
inevitable
discovery
concept?
unknown
speaker
well,
inevitably,
inevitable
discovery.
that
ought
to
be
familiar.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
really
put
it
up
to
you
to
see
if
you
really
mean
it.
suppose
that
they
ask
him,
where
is
the
body,
and
he
tells
them,
and
it
just
turns
out
they've
already
found
it
and
the
officers
just
didn't
know
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
they've
also
violated
his
right
to
counsel.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
right
to
counsel
is
don't
interrogate
him
without
counsel.
unknown
speaker
excluding
the
evidence
is
only
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you've
been
saying
to
me,
mr.
bartels,
this
isn't
a
remedy
case,
that
exclusion
of
the
evidence
is
not
as
a
remedy
for
the
sixth
amendment
violation;
it
is
itself...
the
admission
of
the
evidence
is
itself--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
you
were.
well,
mr.
bartels--
[laughter]
--i
suppose
we
couldn't
have
imposed
the
exclusionary
rule
on
the
states
in
mapp
against
ohio
for
fourth
amendment
violations
unless
you
could
say,
perhaps
somewhat
free
of
phrase,
the
act,
the
introduction
of
that
evidence
itself
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
why
does
the
fact
that
the
introduction
of
evidence
introduced
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
amendment,
why
is
that
any
different
than
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartels,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
really
understand
your
sixth
amendment
argument.
assuming,
as
counsel
on
the
other
side
have
argued,
that
there
was
an
independent
source
that
was
found
to
have
existed
by
three
courts,
as
is
argued,
in
what
respect
would
the
right
to
counsel
be
violated
on
the
basis
of
that
assumption?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
factual
issue?
unknown
speaker
if
you
change
my
terminology
to
"inevitable
discovery",
doesn't
that
in
itself
result
in
an
issue
of
fact
only,
so
far
as--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
bartels,
courts
traditionally
are
called
upon
to
make
factual
determinations,
for
instance
in
setting
damages
in
civil
cases,
that
require
you
to
make
hypothetical
projections.
this
isn't
something
unknown
to
triers
of
fact.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
same
as
an
attenuation
inquiry,
isn't
it?
ceccolini
or
wong
sun.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
substantial
factor.
you
can
say--
unknown
speaker
--but
for,
it
was
caused,
but
still
it's
not
enough
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bartels,
suppose
that
williams
was
asked,
where's
the
body,
and
he
tells
them,
the
officer,
and
they
drive
over
to
this
place
and
they
see
some
searchers
walking
up
the
bar
pit
500
yards
away
from
the
culvert.
and
they
yell
at
the
fellow
and
say:
don't
mind
going
on;
it's
right
up
there
at
the
culvert.
so
it's
absolutely
a
lead
pipe
cinch
that
the
body
would
have
been
found.
you
still
would
be
making
your
same
argument,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
just
go
on
until
we
get
to
facts
so
that
it
is
a
lead
pipe
cinch.
and
you
would
still
make
that
argument?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartels,
either
you
or
someone,
perhaps
several,
have
referred
to
the
social
costs
that
are
involved
in
these
areas
with
respect
to
one
side.
here
is
a
case
which
has
been
going
on
for
how
many
years
now,
14,
10?
unknown
speaker
fourteen
years.
i
am
not
aware...
and
we
have
of
course
all
followed
it
closely...
of
a
single
one
of
the
35,
some
35
to
50
judges
who've
dealt
with
it,
or
indeed
any
of
the
lawyers,
who
have
ever
seriously
thought
there
was
any
question
about
guilt.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
is
there
a
social...
let's
assume...
it
isn't
critical
to
my
hypothetical
or
to
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you.
that
being
true,
is
there
not
a
social
cost,
a
significant
social
cost
if,
after
all
this
massive
amount
of
judicial
procedure
and
legal
work,
it
should
be
determined
that
this
plainly
guilty
defendant
should
go
free
from
this
grisly
murder?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
social
cost
on
that
side
of
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
doubt
about
it?
unknown
speaker
no
judge
that's
ever
touched
the
case
that
i
am
aware
of
has
even
seriously--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
all
based
on
the...
all
of
that
theory
is
based
on
the
idea
that
he
was
more
or
less
entrapped,
that
he
found
the
body
of
this
dead
girl
and
wrapped
it
up
in
a
blanket
and
took
it
out
of
the
ymca
building
and
took
it
out
in
the
country
and
buried
it.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--but
would
you
admit
that,
with
this
kind
of
a
picture,
there
is
a
social
cost
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
haven't
decided
that
yet,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartels,
is
there
any
similarity
between
your
sixth
amendment
argument
and
the
good
faith
argument?
unknown
speaker
the
good
faith
argument
was
advanced
and
relied
on
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
an
absence
of
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
two
so
far
as
results
go?
of
course,
one
is
tied
to
a
constitutional
provision.
but
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
question,
don't
you
have
to
look
to
the
evidence?
