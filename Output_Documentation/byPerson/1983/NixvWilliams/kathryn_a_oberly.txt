ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine,
as
mr.
appel
has
pointed
out,
balances
the
same
competing
interests
that
this
court's
independent
source
doctrine
has
served
for
years.
on
the
one
hand,
it's
the
court's
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
police
don't
benefit
from
illegal
conduct;
and
on
the
other
hand,
it's
also
the
court's
duty
to
make
sure
that
society's
interest
in
convicting
guilty
defendants
isn't
frustrated
by
keeping
reliable
and
untainted
evidence
from
a
jury.
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
accomplishes
both
of
these
purposes,
as
it
has
in
this
case.
evidence
that's
been
obtained
only
as
a
result
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation
has
been
suppressed
from
the
retrial
in
this
case.
but
evidence
that
the
police
would
have
found
anyway,
as
three
courts
have
found
in
this
case,
is
properly
admitted
because
the
competing
policy
interests
that
i've
mentioned
are
fully
served
by
putting
the
police
and
the
defendant
back
in
the
position
they
would
have
occupied
had
there
been
no
illegality.
i'd
like
to
address...
add
to
one
point
that
mr.
appel
made
about
the
fact
that
this
started
off
as
a
sixth
amendment
case.
the
respondent's
argument
in
his
brief
seems
to
be
that
because
this
is
the
sixth
amendment
rather
than
the
fourth
amendment,
that
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
can
never
apply
to
this
situation.
what
he
really
seems
to
be
arguing
is
that
there's
no
cure
for
the
violation
this
court
found
in
brewer
versus
williams
and
that
because
he
won
that
case
he
should
automatically
win
this
case.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
morrison
established
that
victims
of
sixth
amendment
violations
are
no
more
entitled
to
automatic
remedies
than
victims
of
fourth
amendment
violations.
the
court's
language
in
morrison
was
to
note
that
its
task
is
to
identify
and
neutralize
the
taint
and
limit
the
remedy
to
making
sure
that
the
government
is
deprived
of
the
fruits
of
its
transgression,
and
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
the
retrial
of
this
case,
when
all
trades
of
the
sixth
amendment
violation
in
brewer
versus
williams
were
purged
from
the
second
trial
and
the
second
trial
proceeded
as
essentially
an
entirely
different
case.
i'd
like
to
address
the
two
major
objections
that
are
most
often
voiced
at
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
the
first
is
that
it
undermines
the
deterrent
rationale
for
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
second
is
that
it
forces
courts
to
engage
in
too
much
speculation.
concern
about
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
exclusionary
rule
was
what
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
impose
a
good
faith
requirement,
or
what
it
called
the
absence
of
bad
faith,
as
an
element
of
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
but
from
a
practical
standpoint
the
deterrence
rationale
and
the
absence
of
bad
faith
simply
doesn't
bear,
in
our
view,
any
logical
relationship
to
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
the
argument
seems
to
be
that
if
there's
no
good
faith
requirement
then
the
police
would
be
encouraged
to
commit
constitutional
violations
by
taking
shortcuts
that
would
save
them
time
and
money,
on
the
theory
that
they
would
know
there'd
be
no
penalty
attached
to
it
because
later
the
prosecution
could
get
the
evidence
in
under
inevitable
discovery.
that
seems
to
us
not
very
logical
thinking
to
assume
that
a
policeman
would
engage
in,
and
in
fact
it
seems
to
us
that
his
thinking
would
be
just
the
opposite.
the
more
likely
a
policeman
is
certain
that
the
evidence
he
wants
can
be
obtained
lawfully,
the
less
incentive
there
is
for
him
to
commit
a
deliberate
constitutional
violation,
because
if
he
does
so
he
knows
that
he's
risking
the
prosecution,
he's
risking
personal
liability,
disciplinary
actions
or
civil
damages
suits
against
him,
and
he
knows
that
there's
no
need
to
do
it
because
he's
convinced
that
the
evidence
he
wants
can
be
obtained
through
lawful
means.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
he's
not
certain
that
the
evidence
he
wants
can
be
obtained
lawfully,
then
again
there's
no
incentive
for
him
to
resort
to
illegal
conduct
because
he'll
have
no
confidence,
no
reason
for
confidence,
that
the
prosecution
would
be
able
to
successfully
make
use
of
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
so
in
either
event
we
think
it's
just
not
a
rational
prediction
of
how
policemen
would
think
to
assume
that
if
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
is
embraced
by
this
court
it
would
encourage
police
to
take
unconstitutional
shortcuts.
i
also
agree
fully
with
mr.
appel
that
from
an
analytical
perspective
good
faith
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine.
the
whole
premise
of
the
doctrine
is
that
the
initial
taint,
whether
sixth
amendment
or
fourth
amendment
violation,
has
been
purged
and
the
evidence
in
the
retrial
is
admitted--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--you
could
do
either,
your
honor.
i
think
that
you
could
say
their
theory
was
wrong
and
remand
for
them
to
consider
the
facts.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that's
probably
unnecessary
in
this
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
they
didn't,
but
three
courts
have
independently,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
case
before.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
this
case
has
been
around
for
15
years.
the
government
would
not
object
to
a
remand
and
i
don't
think
i
would
either,
if
the
court
thought
it
was
necessary.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
15.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it's
not
unacceptable
to
the
government
or
to
iowa
for
there
to
be
a
remand.
but
three
courts
have
independently
reviewed
the
facts
in
this
case
de
novo,
including
the
iowa
supreme
court,
which
has
a
rule
of
de
novo
review
of
factual
questions
in
constitutional
cases,
and
they
have
all
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
that
discovery
was
inevitable.
and
i
think
that
it's
certainly
possible
for
this
court
to
reach
the
same
conclusion
without...
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
standard
that
the
chief
justice
alluded
to.
we
certainly
endorse
the
preponderance--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--if
good
faith
is
an
element
at
all,
we
would
have
it
be
an
objective
inquiry,
which
would
basically
be
a
question
of
law:
whether
the
officer
knew
or
should
have
known
that
he
was
not
complying--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--nothing
subjective
at
all.
in
fact,
a
subjective
inquiry
is
completely
unproductive.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
used
completely
the
wrong
standard.
it
used
a
subjective
standard.
the
iowa
supreme
court
used
the
correct...
if
there's
to
be
good
faith
at
all,
the
iowa
supreme
court
properly
used
an
objective
test.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
the
iowa--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
iowa
supreme
court--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--said
it
is.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
but
that's
equally
wrong.
but
if
it's
defeated--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
iowa
can
clearly
make
it
an
element
of
its
test.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that's
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
explicit
words
that
the
test
for
good
faith
is
subjective,
and
they
used
as
an
example,
i
think,
something
that
points
out
how
erroneous
their
test
is.
they
said,
we
don't
even
have
in
this
record
a
self-serving
statement
from
detective
leaming
that
he
didn't
intend
to
violate--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
shouldn't
be
an
element
and
it
certainly
shouldn't
be
a
subjective
test.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
we
didn't
address
that
because
the
federal
interest
in
that
question
seemed
less
clear,
but
we
fully
support
the
state's
argument
on
that
issue.
the
final
point
i'd
like
to
make
relates
to
the
standard
of
proof.
we
think
that
the
lower
courts
all
properly
applied
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
of
proof.
that's
the
standard
that
this
court
has
used
for
determining
such
things
as
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
in
the
lego
case
or
consent
to
a
search
in
the
matlock
case.
and
basically
what
the
preponderance
standard
means
is
that
if
it's
more
probable
than
not
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
discovered,
then
the
jury
should
have
the
benefit
of
that
evidence.
we
think
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
that
respondent
is
arguing
for
gives
insufficient
weight
to
society's
quite
compelling
interest
in
having
all
relevant
evidence
before
a
jury.
if
the
government's
able
to
show
that
the
evidence
more
probably
than
not
would
have
been
found,
then
the
jury
should
have
that
evidence
before
it,
and
there's
nothing
unfair
to
the
defendant
in
applying
that
standard.
thank
you.
