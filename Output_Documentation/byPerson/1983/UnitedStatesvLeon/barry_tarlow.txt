mr.
barry
tarlow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
proposition
advanced
by
petitioner
in
this
case
as
well
as
being
unconstitutional
is
unnecessary,
unmanageable,
and
illogical.
its
consequences,
among
other
things,
would
include
nullifying
the
primary
purpose
of
the
warrant
clause,
undermining
the
systemic
deterrence
rationale,
abandoning
the
continued
scrutiny
of
magistrates
which
in
gates
was
declared
to
be
so
essential,
and
would
generate
burdensome
and
cumbersome
litigation.
the
foundation
of
petitioner's
argument
seems
to
rest
on
the
proposition
of
how
can
you
deter
a
police
officer
who
is
acting
in
objective
good
faith,
or
who
is
acting
in
good
faith?
this
assumes
that
the
officer
is
acting
in
subjective
good
faith,
and
we
can
avoid
a
subjective
inquiry,
but
yet
petitioner's
standard
or
test
proposes
that
it
only
be
an
objective
test,
and
we
do
not
explore
the
minds
of
police
officers.
petitioner's
argument
ignores
the
systemic
deterrence
value
of
suppression,
the
fact
that
we
are
appealing
to
wider
audiences,
that
the
police
officer
should
do
some
additional
screening,
some
additional
investigation.
perhaps
the
police
officer
at
the
time
of
agular
was
acting
in
reasonable,
objective
good
faith,
but
nevertheless
the
effect
of
the
decision
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
warrants
complied
with
the
constitutional
mandate.
finally,
the
position
ignores
that
it
is
the
police
officer
who
managed
to
obtain
a
warrant
once
he
believed
that
he
had
sufficient
probable
cause
to
pass
a
standard.
now,
the
magistrate
is
not
the
legal
advisor
of
the
police
department.
this
is
police
error.
magistrate
shopping
does
in
fact
occur
in
our
system.
the
police
officer
did
not
set
out
to
get
the
most
impartial
opinion
that
he
could
find
about
whether
the
warrant
was
valid.
he
set
out
to
get
a
magistrate
who
would
sign
his
signature
on
a
warrant
that
the
police
officer
believed
would
hold
up
in
court,
and
if
we
look
at
the--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--well,
the
realities--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--there
is
not
testimony,
your
honor,
but
there
is--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--i
think
that
the
cases,
at
least,
carancos
in
the
second
circuit,
the
studies
that
have
been
done,
all
recognize
that...
and
no
one
is
saying
that
all
magistrates
are
rubber
stamps.
no
one
is
saying
that
everyone
magistrate
shops.
but
the
studies,
particularly
the
van
dusen
study
that
was
just
prepared
by
the...
with
nij
funding,
involving
900
warrants
in
six
cities
across
the
country,
establish
that
in
71
percent
of
the
time
warrants
were
signed
in
three
minutes
or
less.
maybe
the
nature
of
the
warrant
process
that
we
see
in
the
courts
can
explain
how
something
as
bizarre
as
what
happened
in
the
shepherd
case
occurred,
how
all
these
people
can
be
involved
in
the
process
and
nobody
read
the
piece
of
paper,
but
as
we
look
at
the
reports
of
the
people
who
have
gone
out
and
studied
the
magistrate
process,
magistrate
shopping
does
in
fact
occur,
and
the
point,
at
least,
in
agular
and
spinnelli
was
that
the
court
wanted
to
be
sure
to
eliminate
the
phenomena
of
the
rubber
stamp
magistrate.
the
good
faith
exception
is
certainly...
or
proposal
is
certainly
nothing
new.
it
was
rejected
in
beck
versus
ohio,
and
a
similar
argument
seemed
to
be
rejected
in
justice
elackmun's
opinion
in
u.s.
versus
johnson.
in
effect,
it
would
turn
the
warrant
requirement
on
its
head.
it
would
be
the
police
officer's
judgment
which
determines
whether
in
fact
the
evidence
would
be
admissible
in
court,
not
the
constitution.
the
concept
that
the
law
is
too
complicated
simply
does
not
meet
with
present
day
reality.
the
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
all
federal
warrants
are
reviewed
by
attorneys.
this
happens
in
state
cases.
in
this
case,
three
da's
looked
at
the
warrant.
this
wasn't
a
warrant
prepared
in
haste.
it
was
prepared
over
a
one-month
period.
and
it
seems
that
they
could
have
got
it
right
in
that
period
of
time.
if
they
didn't
have
enough,
the
answer
was,
don't
go
to
the
magistrate
with
it.
mr.
barry
tarlow
it
was
something
wrong
with
the
facts,
that
they
couldn't
show
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
would
be
found
in
a
particular
location.
if
the
evidence
is
not
there,
the
answer
to
me
does
not
seem
to
be
that
you
can
go
to
a
magistrate
and
see
if
you
can
get
a
signature
anyway.
mr.
barry
tarlow
a
magistrate--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--as
to
my
client--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--it
was
issued
before
illinois
versus
gates.
mr.
barry
tarlow
after
illinois
versus
gates,
as
to
defendant
del
castillo
and
as
to
my
client,
a
reasonable
magistrate
would
not
have
issued
that
warrant.
take
del
castillo,
your
honor,
which
is
the
simplest
of
the
fact
patterns.
all
that...
and
my
client
becomes
a
little
more
complicated,
but
it
still
is
nowhere
near
being
sufficient.
all
they
have
in
del
castillo
is
this.
no
informant.
he
was
seen
at
the
house.
his
car
was
seen
at
the
house
of
a
suspected
narcotics
dealer
three
times,
and
one
of
those
times
he
was
seen
on
the
porch,
and
two
years
before
he
was
arrested
for
marijuana.
all
that
is
is
mere
association.
it
is
nothing.
there
is--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--your
honor,
mere
association
i
didn't
think
was
consistent
with
innocence
as
guilt.
mr.
barry
tarlow
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
held,
your
honor,
on
any
facts,
anything
close
to
this,
you
can
get
a
warrant
for
a
man's
car
or
a
man's
house,
and
if
that
is
the
case,
if
this
case
comes
within
either
gates
or
within
a
supposed
good
faith
exception,
there
is
nothing
left
to
the
warrant
clause.
only
agular--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--i
am
saying...
we
did
argue
in
our
brief
as
to
my
client
that
even
within
a
good
faith
exception
we
would
win,
but
that,
as
i
was
arguing--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--that
might
be,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
overriding
considerations.
of
course,
my
primary
responsibility
is
whether
my
client's...
the
outcome
of
my
client's
case.
mr.
barry
tarlow
nevertheless,
as
this
court
speaks,
it
sends
a
message
to
law
enforcement
officers,
to
the
public
about
our
constitutional
rights.
enacting
something
such
as
good
faith
would
seem
to
me
to
send
out
a
message
which
would
encourage
police
officers--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--well,
i
said
mr.
del
castillo.
mr.
leon
is
my
client.
but
it
was
mr.
leon
and
mr.
del
castillo.
the
message
would
be
that
instead
of,
as
this
court
has
said,
that
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity,
which
might
be
co-extensive
with
the--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--exclusionary--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--what
it
would
say,
though--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--you
didn't
make
it
this
time,
but
if
you
have
to
make
a
mistake,
don't
make
it
on
the
side
of
constitutional
behavior,
make
that
mistake
on
the
side
of
unconstitutional
behavior,
because
if
you
are
wrong,
the
evidence
can
still
be
admissible.
don't
try
to
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment.
just
see
if
you
can
come
close.
the
message
to
the
police
officer
would
simply
be
this
in
a
good
faith
case,
i
would
think,
in
almost
all
cases.
if
you
got
a
warrant,
the
evidence
would
be
admissible.
mr.
barry
tarlow
well,
if
that
is
true...
one
point.
your
honor
mentioned
illinois
versus
gates.
you
struck...
your
duty
was
to
strike
the
balance
true,
and
that's
what
you
did
there.
if
that
was
so,
and
if
a
good
faith
exception
was
ever
needed
before
illinois
versus
gates,
it
certainly
isn't
needed
now,
after
illinois
versus
gates.
mr.
barry
tarlow
it
wouldn't
affect
it
at
all.
mr.
barry
tarlow
well,
of
course,
i
suppose,
obviously...
he
was
seen
one
time
in
one
month,
but
i
suppose...
well,
i
don't...
your
honor,
if
he
was
seen
12
times
in
12
days,
i
don't
think
that
means
you
could
search
his
car.
maybe
he
lives
there.
maybe
he
is
a
neighbor.
maybe
he
is
dating
the
daughter.
any
other
thing.
being
seen
in
the
company
of
somebody,
and
nothing
more--
mr.
barry
tarlow
--maybe
she
has
graduated
from
school
and
is
in
between
things,
and
is
home
at
12:00.
but,
no,
i
don't
see
how
mere
association
could
ever
establish
either
probable
cause
or
good
faith.
mr.
barry
tarlow
it
is
not
probable
cause
or
close
to
it,
at
least
under
any
case
that
i
have
ever
seen
either
from
this
court
or
from
any
other
court.
i
am
sure
if
i
am
wrong
the
solicitor
could
point
out
where
some
court
has
held
that
because
in
a
one-month
period
you
have
been
around,
your
car
was
seen
three
times
and
you
were
on
someone's
porch,
that
means
they
can
search
your
car.
now,
history,
i
believe,
has
taught
us
one
thing,
at
least,
about
the
exclusionary
rule.
if
there
is
no
remedy,
if
we
just
say
that
there
will
be
a
violation,
the
constitution
prohibits
it,
but
no
exclusionary
rule,
the
police
conduct
will
be
unrestrained.
that
is
what
happened
between
wolf
versus
colorado
and
mapp.
it
is
what
everyone
recognizes.
the
court
recognized
what
happened.
the
people,
like
the
commissioner
of
police
in
new
york,
who
said,
why
bother
before
mapp.
that
was
their
position,
and
unless
there
is
a
remedy
imposed
by
this
court,
the
constitution
will
be
nothing
more
than
hollow
words.
it
will
just
be,
the
search
is
illegal,
but
it
doesn't
matter.
particularly
if
there
is
a
good
faith
exception,
what
remedy
could
possibly
exist?
there
could
be
no
remedy
within
the
criminal
proceeding.
and
there
could
be
no
remedy
civilly,
because
the
same
good
faith
would
prevent
any
kind
of
civil
remedy,
even
if
in
some
etherial
or
mystical
sense
a
civil
remedy
really
was
available
to
people
who
have
been
illegally
searched.
mr.
barry
tarlow
he
is
immune.
the
officer
is
immune
if
he
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
barry
tarlow
as
i
understand
the
law.
certainly
i
am
far
from
being
an
expert
on
understanding
harlow
versus
fitzgerald,
but
at
least
i
understand
that
if
the
officer
acts
in
good
faith
in
conducting
the
search,
he
is
immune.
mr.
barry
tarlow
well,
then
all
that
happens
is
that
you...
well,
but
there
is
a
finding
within
the
criminal
case
that
he
acted
in
good
faith.
it
would
seem
to
me
someone
would...
it
certainly
would
make
no
sense,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
lawyer
who
would
ever
pursue
a
remedy
like
that.
in
addition,
the
requirement
of
judicial
integrity
seems
to
require
that
the
court
discourage,
not
encourage
constitutional
violations.
now,
how
can
a
good
faith
exception
possibly
discourage
constitutional
violations?
it
will
be,
as
justice
stewart,
former
justice
stewart
mentioned
in
his
article.
the
focus
will
not
be
on
the
fourth
amendment,
but
what
violations
will
be
condoned.
the
effects
of
the
rule
and
the
impact
of
the
exclusionary
rule
have
certainly
been
grossly
exaggerated.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
go
through
all
of
the
studies
which
we
have
listed
in
our
brief.
one
part,
though,
becomes
important.
the
centerpiece
or
a
centerpiece
of
the
solicitor's
brief
is
a
quote
from
justice
white's
footnote
13
in
gates,
where
justice
white,
observing
the
comments
of
the
solicitor
as
an
amicus
in
gates,
justice
white
then
made
the
statement
that
30
percent
of
all
felony
drug
prosecutions
in
california
are
dismissed
or
are
not
prosecuted
for
search
and
seizure
reasons.
now,
this
is
quite
simply
a
mistake.
not
only
is
it
a
mistake,
it
is
exaggerated
14
times.
in
davies'
study
of
the
california
arrest
proceedings,
the
actual
rate
in
california
is
2.3
percent
of
the
drug
arrests,
not
of
all
arrests,
just
drug
arrests,
2.3
percent
are
not
prosecuted.
of
all
arrests,
it
is
only.8
percent
are
not
prosecuted,
and
this
is
in
a
state
where
there
is
no
standing
requirement
of
any
kind,
where
independent
state
grounds
are
urged
all
the
time,
and
where
we
even
have
protections
in
our
garbage
cans
sitting
in
front
of
our
houses.
this
supposed
good
faith
exception
would
abandon
review
of
the
magistrate.
it
will
not
be
the
inferences
drawn
by
the
magistrates
which
will
become
the
center
of
the
hearings.
it
will
be
the
inferences
drawn
by
the
police
officer,
and
obviously
the
constitution
should
encourage
and
this
court
should
encourage
the
use
of
warrants,
but
it
seems
at
the
same
time
you
must
encourage
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
warrant
process.
it
is
not
just
to
encourage
the
use
of
a
piece
of
paper,
but
to
encourage
a
valid
warrant.
good
faith
would
provide
for
no
meaningful
review
of
magistrates'
decisions.
justice
rehnquist
recognized
the
need
for
continued
review
of
magistrates'
decisions
in
gates,
talked
about
the
non-lawyer
magistrate
situation.
we
outlined
this
in
our
brief.
i
don't
know
if
at
the
time
of
gates
you
were
or
were
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
problem,
but
there
are
over
10,000
magistrates
in
this
country
who
are
not
lawyers,
who
can
issue
warrants,
some
without
even
high
school
educations.
many
of
these
warrants
are
admissible
in
federal
court.
all
the
evidence
would
be
admissible
in
federal
court
in
the
event
federal
officers
didn't
participate
in
the
search,
but
many
of
these
magistrates
can
issue
warrants
under
rule
41.
the
review
of
magistrates
in
the
view
of
people
who...
of
authorities,
sources
who
have
considered
the
problem
does
in
fact
deter
the
magistrates.
it
makes
them
more
careful.
this
was
the
basis
for
u.s.
versus
caranthos,
where
the
second
circuit
rejected
this
same
contention
in
1976,
and
concluded
that
review
plus
the
exclusionary
rule
induces
magistrates
to
scrutinize
warrants
and
avoids
rubber
stamps.
this
is
the
same
opinion
that
former
justice
stewart
reached.
the
good
faith
standard
that
the
prosecutor,
that
the
petitioner
proposes
is
just
simply
unworkable.
in
the
words
of
justice
powell,
it
would
confound
the
confusion
to
try
and
apply
that.
is
it
objective
or
is
it
subjective?
it
is
easy
to
say,
omit
the
subjective
component.
but
that
won't
work
because
the
premise
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
individual
is
acting
in
subjective
good
faith.
what
is
the
standard
for
the
reasonable
police
officer?
for
example,
petitioner's
brief,
when
we
said,
what
do
you
do
with
a
rural
sheriff
from
alaska,
petitioner
says,
if
the
sheriff
is
testifying
in
new
york
city,
the
standard
is
the
standard
in
new
york
city.
and
if
that
same
sheriff
were
testifying
apparently
in
the
federal
court
in
alaska,
we
would
have
a
totally
different
standard
as
to
what
the
good
faith
rule
requires.
what
do
you
do
with
a
whitley
versus
warden
situation,
where
a
bad
warrant
which
justice
white
would
say
would
not
pass
the
good
faith
test
was
communicated
to
an
officer
over
a
telephone
call
or
on
a
radio,
and
the
officer
never
even
saw
the
warrant.
is
that
officer
at
the
end
of
the
phone
acting
reasonably,
even
though
there
is
no
probable
cause?
there
are
just
simply
layers
and
layers
of
problems.
if
it
is
shown
to
a
police
officer,
or
to
a
u.s.
attorney,
is
it
a
reasonable
police
officer,
is
it
a
reasonable
u.s.
attorney
that
we
are
talking
about?
clearly,
the
cases
have
established...
or
history
has
established
there
is
no
meaningful
alternative
remedy.
civil
suits
don't
work.
injunctions
don't
work
in
the
absence
of
municipal
policy.
the
government's
argument,
to
say
the
least,
is
disingenuous
in
view
of
some
of
these
bills
that
are
pending
in
congress
which
would
strip
away
all
the
protections.
mr.
barry
tarlow
thank
you.
