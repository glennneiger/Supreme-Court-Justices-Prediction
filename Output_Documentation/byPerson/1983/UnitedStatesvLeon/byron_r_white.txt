justice

white
well,
on
that
basis...
perhaps
we
just
ought
to
reverse
on
that
basis,
that
they
acted
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment.

another
illinois
against
gates.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
assume
that
we
wanted
to
do
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
what
magistrates
in
the
ninth
circuit
would
be
bound
to
do.
they
would
be
bound
not
to
issue
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
other
circuits,
if
the
rule
was
different,
they
would
not
issue
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could,
on
that
basis,
you
could
win,
i
suppose,
win
your
case
even
with
a
good
faith
exception,
because
any...
what
you
are
submitting
is
that
any
fool
would
know
you
shouldn't
get
a
warrant
on
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
still
win,
right
here,
even
if
the
government
wins.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
kind
of
a
message
would
it
send
out
if
we
said,
there
is
a
good
faith
exception,
but
it
doesn't
do
the
government
any
good
here.
anybody
should
have
known
there
wasn't
probable
cause
in
connection
with
mr....
what
is
it,
costello,
castillo?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
certainly
wouldn't
say--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
certainly
wouldn't
suggest
you
ought
to
be
careless.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
suggest
that
you
ought
to
be
careful.
