is
it
your
view
that
error
was
committed
both
by
the
magistrate
and
the
police?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
primarily?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
police
actually
appeared
to
act
with
considerable
diligence,
once
they
got
the
tip.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
we
ever
held
explicitly
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
the
action
of
the
magistrate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
think
you
are
asking
us
to
make
a
finding
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
make
before.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
apart
from
the
integrity
point,
i
think
this
court
has
said
a
half
a
dozen
times
at
least
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
we
ever
said
the
purpose
was
to
deter
unlawful
conduct
by
the
magistrate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
so
however
right
you
may
be,
this
is
a
new
issue
for
us
to
consider,
explicitly.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
i
will
ask
you
one
other
question.
do
you
think
deterrence
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
magistrate
who
is
removed,
at
least
it
seems
to
me,
from
the
same
sort
of
atmosphere
that
a
police
officer...
in
which
the
police
officer
acts?
he
is
a
judicial
officer.
so
my
inquiry
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
deter
conduct,
would
apply
equally
to
a
magistrate
as
to
a
police
officer?
