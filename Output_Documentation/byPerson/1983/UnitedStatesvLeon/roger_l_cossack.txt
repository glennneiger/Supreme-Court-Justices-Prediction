mr.
roger
l.
cossack
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
i
would
first
like
to
start
by
answering
justice
rehnquist's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
probable
cause
would
be
found
under
the
gates
decision
as
to
my
clients,
mr.
sanchez
and
ms.
stewart,
who
were
the
object
of
the
tip.
i
would
categorically
say
that
probable
cause
would
not
be
found,
and
that
is
the
crux
of
what
the
problem
is
in
the
government's
presentation,
the
government...
in
gates,
as
you
know,
there
was
a
tip
for
immediate
action.
i
believe
the
tip
came
in,
the
letter
came
in
on
may
3rd,
and
by
may
5th
corroborative
events
had
taken
place.
the
court
in
upholding
the
gates
decision
relied
on
united
states
versus
draper,
and
as
the
court
knows
in
that
case
they
were
able
to
also
predict
immediately
what
the
activities
of
mr.
draper
would
do
with
uncanny
accuracy,
the
same
train
station,
the
same
clothes,
et
cetera,
and
things
like
that.
in
gates,
they
were
able
to
predict
what
mr.
gates
would
do
immediately
and
where
mrs.
gates
would
be
found.
the
problem
is
our
case
is
that
the
tip
came
in
five
months
after
the
act,
so
that
the
police
officers
were
armed
with
a
stale
tip
that
they
went
out
to
corroborate.
there
was
no
evidence
of
future
corroboration.
there
was
no
evidence
of
immediate
corroboration,
as
there
was
in
gates
and
as
there
was
in
draper,
yet
the
government
would
have
us
adopt
a
rule,
have
you
adopt
a
rule
that
said
even
though
under
gates
there
would
be
no...
as
under
gates,
there
would
be
no
probable
cause,
there
would
be...
it
would
be
all
right
to
admit
the
evidence
in
this
matter
solely
based
upon
some
kind
of,
i
suppose,
knee-jerk
reaction
that
when
a
police
officer
finds
a
magistrate
who
has
erred
the
evidence
should
come
in.
that
can
do
nothing
but
denigrate
that
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
gives
us
as
individuals
of
the
citizenry
the
right
to
be
protected
in
our
home
and
in
our
cars
and
in
our
personal
things
from
an
unwarranted
invasion
by
police
officers.
i
believe
that
deterrence
is
the
sole
rationale
in
a
search
warrant
case
that
is
conceptually
flawed.
the
fourth
amendment,
like
the
entire
bill
of
rights,
exists
to
prohibit
the
government
from
using
certain
means
to
effect
goals
that
the
public
believes
are
legitimate.
there
is
no
question
that
the
public
believes
these
goals
are
legitimate,
but
no
matter
how
legitimate
these
goals
are,
and
no
matter
how
good
the
goals
are,
they
cannot
be
done
by
means
which
are
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
that,
the
lynch
pin
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
probable
cause.
there
is
the
cost
benefit
analysis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
that
part
of
the
fourth...
it
is
that
part
of
the
amendment
which
gives
the...
which
describes
that
particular
time
when
the
individual's
right
to
be
secure
in
their
home
must
give
way
to
society's
collective
good
to
promote
the
general
welfare
and
control
crime.
now,
once
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
found,
then
i
believe
that
a
remedy
has
to
take
place
or
else
we
have
a
statement
of
a
right
without
any
effective
way
of
having
a
remedy.
and
what
we
have
here
is,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
question
that
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
found.
there
was
no
probable
cause.
the
government
concedes
there
was
no
probable
cause.
they
do
not
even
ask
at
any
time
that
this
case
should
be
reviewed
under
the
gates
theory.
they
concede,
i
suppose,
that
even
under
gates
there
was
no
probable
cause.
but
yet
they
wish
to
say
that
because
a
magistrate
erred,
that
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
keeps
us
secure
in
our
home
and
secure
in
our
rights
as
citizens
under
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
occur.
i
believe
that
again
the
cost
benefit
analysis
that
i
indicate
is
proper
when
deciding
the
scope
of
who
the
fourth
amendment
may
apply
to
as,
for
example,
this
court
did
in
the
standing
cases.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
a
cost
benefit
analysis
is
proper
once
a
violation
has
been
found.
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
the
exclusionary
rule,
i
believe,
as
it
stands,
is
correct.
it
should
deter
unconstitutional
police
activity,
and
the
reasons
that
it
may
not
in
particular
situations
are
invalid.
we
have
heard
statements
that
the
police
feel
frustrated,
and
that
they
don't
understand
the
opinions,
and
that
they
see
our
courts
as
nitpickers
who
are
preventing
them
from
doing
what
they
should
be
doing.
certainly
sociological
studies
have
indicated...
i
am
referring
particularly
to
mr.
skolech
and
mr.
goldstein's
studies...
that
police
feel
as
a
group
disassociated
from
the
common
society.
they
are
seeing
themselves
as
authority
figures.
they
see
themselves
as
individuals
who
are
doing
the
correct
thing
and
are
stopped
from
doing
it
by
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
prevent
them
from
doing
it.
it
is
impossible
to
think,
therefore,
that
they
would
be
deterred
by
any
internal
police
activity,
especially
if
they
think
that
they
are
acting
in
good
faith.
it
therefore
becomes
incumbent
upon
the
court
not
to
back
down
from
the
rule
which
is
attempting
to
effectuate
a
goal
which
everyone
believes
is
a
correct
goal,
that
is,
to
deter
unconstitutional
police
behavior,
but
to
have
a
rule
which
would
be
better
communicated
to
the
police,
and
also
to
set
up
training
programs,
which
i
suppose
would
include
the
police
and
understand
their
function
in
our
society
and
their
function
vis-a-vis
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
constitution,
so
that
they
will
not
feel,
as
studies
seem
to
indicate,
disassociated
from
the
rest
of
us
when
decisions
go
against
them.
now,
implicit
in
the
government's
position
is
that
alternative
remedies
can
effectuate
the
same
thing
that
the
exclusionary
rule
can
do
by...
and
there
are
such
things
as
alternative
remedies.
as
justice
murphy
pointed
out,
the
very
nature
of
alternative
remedies
implies
that
there
are
equal
remedies
that
would
effectuate
the
same
things
that
we
want
the
exclusionary
rule
to
do.
in
fact,
that
isn't
true.
as
co-counsel
has
indicated,
immunity
and
tort
violations
really
are
not
very
effective.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
are
you
suggesting
that--
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
--are
you
suggesting
a
situation,
your
honor,
where
there
was
probable
cause
in
fact,
the
magistrate
reviewed
it,
and
decided
there
wasn't
probable
cause?
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
i
think,
your
honor,
as...
i
am
referring
to
the
case
that
we
heard
this
morning,
which
is
fresh
in
my
mind...
there
may
be
limited
applicability
of
a
good
faith
exception.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
so
that--
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
--are
you
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
the
magistrate
acted
erroneously
on
an
incorrect
warrant
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
probable
cause
when
in
fact
the
police
officer
in
good
faith
misstated
facts?
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
in
those
kinds
of
situations,
the
courts
have
held
that
upon
review
of
the
ex
parte
proceeding,
that
both
sides
would
be
allowed
to
bring
out
that
fact,
and
the
true
facts
would
then
be
presented
to
the
magistrate,
and
if
probable
cause
was
not
present,
then
i
suppose
the
warrant
should
be
suppressed.
if
probable
cause
was
present,
then
the
warrant
should
not
be
suppressed.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
well,
it
is
certainly
my
view
that
error
was
committed
by
the
magistrate.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
primarily
by
the
magistrate.
i
am
not...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
yes,
your
honor.
i
guess
one
could
qualify
their
activities
as
acting
with
diligence.
i
would
say
that
they
surveilled
for
nine
days
and
saw
four
different
activities
of
traffic,
two
of
which
were
by
people
who
were
not
included
in
this
case.
i
also
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
was
clear
that
the
police,
if
you
read
the
affidavit,
that
the
police
thought
that
whatever
the
narcotics
were,
they
are
being
brought
in
from
florida.
they
stopped
my
clients
at
the
los
angeles
international
airport
after
viewing
them
leave
for
florida
and
return
from
florida,
received
a
consent
search
to
examine
their
suitcases,
did
so,
and
found
a
small,
de
minimis
amount
of
marijuana,
which
was
not
filed
upon
by
the
police
department.
i
suppose
it
was
under
an
ounce,
and
in
our
state
that
isn't
a
crime.
they
found
none
of
the
drugs
that
were
described
by
the
informant,
none
of
the
qualudes,
none
of
the
cocaine,
and
it
was
immediately
thereafter
that
they
went
to
the
magistrate
and
asked
for
the
warrant,
i
believe
basically
because
at
that
time
they
obviously
knew
that
their
investigation,
their
under
cover
investigation
or
underground
investigation,
if
you
will,
was
recognized,
and
they
had
to
take
with
what
they
had
to
go
get
the
very
best
warrant
they
could.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
no,
your
honor,
but
you
have
suppressed
cases
in
which
the
magistrate
has
found
probable
cause
where
there
isn't
probable
cause,
so
in
effect
by
implication
you
have
said
that
it
goes
to
the--
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
--no,
i
am
asking
you
to
say,
your
honor,
that
the...
to
go
ahead
with
what
i
believe
you...
this
policy
has
always
been...
the
exclusionary
rule
does
go
to
magistrates
and
their
activities,
and
i
believe
that
that
is
based
upon
the
grounding
that
the
fourth
amendment
not
only...
or
that
the
exclusionary
rule
not
only
deters
police
conduct
but
upholds
the
integrity
of
the
probable
cause
area
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
no,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
you
have
ever
had
presented
to
this
court
a
situation
where
the
government
is
attempting
to
say
that
because
a
magistrate
erred
and
not
a
police
erred,
there
is...
somehow
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
are
somewhat
less
affected
as
they
are
today.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
l.
cossack
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
way
i
can
answer
that
question
is
that,
is
that
it
should,
because
the
net
effect
of
it
is
that
somewhere
an
individual's
rights
guaranteed
as
probable
cause
are
being
affected,
and
therefore
it
is
imperative
upon
us
to
recognize
those
rights,
whether
they
are
hurt
by
improper
police
conduct
or
improper
magistrate
conduct.
