john
paul

may
i
ask,
though,
along
the
same
vein,
mr.
solicitor
general,
supposing
we
decide
this
case
exactly
as
you
urge
the
court
to
do,
and
a
magistrate
in
the
future
is
confronted
with
an
identical
fact
pattern.
should
the
magistrate
issue
the
warrant
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
this
case
is...
assume
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
are
quite
different
from
illinois
against
gates.
he
must
either
decide
that
does
constitute
probable
cause
or
does
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
don't
reach
the
good
faith
rule
unless
we
first
decide,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
is
no
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
you
are
really
not
quite
sure
what
the
magistrate
should
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
is
really
not...
that
is
not
quite
right
on
wood
against
strickland.
there
it's
an
affirmative
defense
good
faith.
you
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
first.
then
you
turn
to
the
affirmative
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
normally
decide
affirmative
defenses
before
you
decide
whether
there
is
a
claim
made
by
the
claiming
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
in
this
case.
