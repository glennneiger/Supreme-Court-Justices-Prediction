mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
before
i
state
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
would
like
first
just
briefly
briefly
to
review
the
governing
principle
of
law
against
whose
background
the
statement
of
facts
should
be
more
helpful.
the
exclusionary
rule
emerged
from
cases
like
weeks
versus
the
united
states
and
mapp
v.
ohio
in
which
law
enforcement
officers
committed
flagrantly
abusive
violations
of
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
officers
knew
or
should
have
known
that
what
they
were
doing
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
they
did
it
anyway.
the
rule
rests
on
the
assumption
that
the
best
way
to
deter
that
kind
of
conduct
is
to
deny
its
evidentiary
fruits
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
who
perpetrated
it.
neither
the
exclusionary
rule
nor
its
underlying
deterrence
assumption
is
being
challenged
in
this
case.
its
applicability
to
cases
of
wilful
misconduct,
like
weeks
and
mapp,
would
be
left
undisturbed
by
the
rule
which
we
propose.
the
net
result
of
weeks
and
mapp
is
that
we
are
willing
to
let
some
criminals
go
free
as
the
necessary
price
for
deterring
the
constable
from
violating
the
fourth
amendment,
but
it
is
a
heavy
price,
and
this
court
has
clarified
that
it
is
a
heavy
price,
and
that
we
do
not
pay
it
beyond
those
cases
to
which
its
underlying
deterrence
rationale
extends.
the
exception
for
which
we
contend
comes
into
play
by
its
very
definition
only
in
those
cases
where
deterrence
would
be
inappropriate,
where
the
police
have
acted
as
a
reasonably
well
trained
officer
would
have
acted
under
the
circumstances.
in
that
kind
of
case,
to
whatever
extent,
excluding
the
evidence,
where
the
police
have
acted
reasonably
deters,
it
deters
too
much.
it
overdeters.
it
is
just
as
likely
to
deter
the
police
from
performing
their
duty
as
it
is
to
encourage
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
therefore,
it
will
not
deter
future
fourth
amendment
violations
so
long
as
the
police
do
their
duty.
this
court's
precedents
make
it
very
clear
that
since
the
paramount
and
perhaps
the
sole
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter,
the
rule
applies
only
to
those
situations
where
the
deterrence
benefits
outweigh
the
costs
of
depressing
highly
probative
evidence.
in
stone
v.
powell
and
united
states
v.
janis,
for
example,
it
was
conceded
that
there
would
have
been
some
additional
evidence,
some
additional
deterrence
from
the
unavailability
of
the
illegally
seized
evidence
at
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceeding
or
a
civil
trial
by
a
different
sovereign.
in
both
of
those
cases
and
others,
the
existence
of
some
marginal
deterrence
from
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
those
additional
proceedings
or
to
those
additional
contexts
was
conceded.
nevertheless,
the
rule
was
held
inapplicable
because
it
could
not
pay
its
way
in
a
cost
benefit
analysis.
the
marginal
evidentiary
cost
exceeded
the
marginal
deterrence
benefit
that
would
result
from
applying
an
exclusionary
rule
to
those
proceedings.
and
it
is
this
court's
deterrence-based
cost
benefit
principle
which
squarely
governs
this
case,
to
whose
facts
i
now
turn.
on
the
cost
side,
the
four
respondents
here
have
been
charged
with
offenses
that
include
the
possession
and
distribution
of
drugs.
the
evidence
that
they
seek
to
exclude,
large
quantities
of
drugs
and
drug
dealing
paraphernalia
found
in
their
residences,
is
highly
relevant
to
the
issue
of
their
guilt
or
innocence.
on
the
deterrence
side,
it
is
really
quite
difficult
to
perceive
just
what
it
is
that
the
police
did
wrong
in
this
case,
or
perhaps
more
appropriately
said,
what
it
is
that
we
would
want
them
to
do
differently
in
the
next
case.
after
receiving
a
tip
from
an
informant
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
brings
into
play,
justice
white--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--another
illinois
against
gates,
and
of
course
my
response
to
that
is
twofold.
the
first
is
that
the
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
questions
presented,
and
the
second
is
that
after
gates,
it
involves
nothing
more
than
a
fact
bound
probable
cause
issue
which
does
not...
which
after
gates
really
does
not
warrant
attention
as
one
of
the
150
cases
that
this
court
each
year
will
review
on
the
merits.
we
have
acted
consistent--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--exactly,
and
i
will
also
assure
you
that
if
you
are
interested
in
reviewing
fact
bound
probable
cause
cases
from
the
ninth
circuit,
we
can
bring
many
more
of
them
here.
0
[generallaughter.]
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--whether
the
magistrate
should
issue
the
warrant
or
not
depends
on
factors
other
than
what
the
court
would
give
in
deciding
this
particular
case,
because
the
relevant
decision
in
guiding
the
magistrate
whether
to
issue
the
warrant
or
not
would
be
illinois
versus
gates,
and
not
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
in
our
view,
those
are
two
completely
separate
issues.
the
one
goes
to
the
wrong,
and
the
other
goes
to
the
remedy.
the
one
goes
to
the
question,
has
there
or
has
there
not
been
a
substantive
fourth
amendment
violation,
and
the
other
goes
to
the
question
whether,
assuming
that
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
what
should
be
the
remedy.
should
the
evidence
or
should
it
not
be
excluded?
the
illinois
versus
gates
went
to
one,
and
united
states
versus
leon
should
go
to
the
other.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
right,
and...
that
is
exactly
right.
it
is
the
only
issue
that
is
before
the
court,
and
of
course,
while
the
court--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
and
that
that
is
not
an
issue...
we
deliberately
have
not
briefed
it.
we
have
not
reached
it.
we
urge
the
court
not
to
reach
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
if
that
is
a
serious
enough--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--precisely.
and
if
that
is
a
serious
enough
problem
for
law
enforcement,
and
if
after
illinois
versus
gates
it
involves
a
serious
recurrent
legal
issue
of
the
kind
that
this
court
should
resolve,
we
will
bring
it
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
have
characterized
this
informant
under
the
usual
standards
as
an
informant
of
unproven
reliability,
the
same
as
in
illinois
versus
gates.
after
receiving
a
tip
from
an
informant
that
two
of
the
respondents
were
selling
drugs
in
large
quantities,
officer
cyril
raumbach
and
other
officers
of
the
burbank
police
department
conducted
a
month-long
investigation
of
two
residences
and
a
condominium,
observed
activities
generally
consistent
with
the
informant's
information,
and
conducted
background
checks
on
persons
whom
they
observed.
based
on
that
information,
on
his
years
of
experience
as
a
narcotics
officer,
and
on
his
specialized
training
in
narcotics
investigations,
officer
raumbach
concluded
that
the
condominium
was
being
used
as
a
distribution
point,
referred
to
as
a
stash
pad,
to
store
large
quantities
of
narcotics
which
were
then
transported
in
smaller
amounts
to
respondents'
residences
for
distribution.
after
consulting
with
three
other
experienced
investigators
and
three
deputy
district
attorneys,
he
applied
for
a
search
warrant,
which
was
issued
by
a
california
superior
court
judge.
now,
as
i
say,
whether
the
magistrate's
judgment
in
this
case
correctly
assessed
the
presence
of
probable
cause
is
not
before
the
court,
but
whether
the
totality
of
those
circumstances
did
or
did
not
amount
to
probable
cause,
it
certainly
could
not
be
said
that
it
should
have
been
clear
to
officer
raumbach
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
or
that
applying
for
a
warrant
would
be
improper
in
the
circumstances.
he
prepared
his
affidavit,
and
presented
it
to
a
magistrate,
so
that
the
decision
whether
to
search
or
not
to
search
was
made
as
this
court
has
stated
so
frequently
that
it
should
be
made,
by
a
judicial
officer,
in
this
case
a
judge,
rather
than
an
executive
officer.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
officer
raumbach's
detailed,
carefully
prepared
18-page
affidavit,
pages
34
to
52
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
shows
that
the
constable
in
this
case
was
a
cautious,
highly
trained,
and
experienced
narcotics
expert
who
brought
his
experience
and
training
to
bear
on
his
decision
to
apply
for
the
warrant.
one
of
the
strengths
of
the
rule
we
propose
is
that
it
encourages
that
kind
of
high
quality
police
work.
far
from
placing
a
premium
on
ignorance,
as
has
been
suggested,
an
objective,
reasonable
good
faith
exception,
an
exception
which
is
keyed
to
the
reasonably
well
trained
officer,
would
place
a
premium
on
reasonableness
and
on
training.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
let
me
turn
to
that.
very
little.
and
the
reason
is
that
whatever
problem
you
have,
justice
o'connor,
at
the
magistrate
level
is
a
problem
that
is
simply
out
side
the
ambit
of
what
the
exclusionary
rule
was
ever
intended
to
accomplish
and
what
it
is
by
its
very
nature
capable
of
accomplishing.
magistrates
are
judicial
officers.
they
are
members
of,
if
you
will,
the
article
iii
branch,
the
judicial
branch.
in
both
the
cases
before
the
court
today,
they
were
judges,
and
the
way--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
even
there,
the
court
clarified
that
there
are
two
requirements
that
magistrates
must
meet.
one
of
them
is
that
they
must
be
neutral
and
unbiased,
and
the
other
is
that
they
have
to
be
capable
of
making
the
probable
cause
judgement.
now,
as
long
as
those
two
requirements
are
met,
those
are
the
two
requirements
that
are
essential
to
the
magistrate's
job.
but
regardless
of
the
level
of
the
training,
as
long
as
they
are
neutral
and
detached,
and
as
long
as
they
are
capable
of
making
the
probable
cause
judgment,
they
are
judges.
they
are
part
of
the
judicial
branch.
and
the
way
our
system--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
absolutely
right.
they
are
performing
as
judges.
and
the
way
that
our
system
corrects
their
past
errors
and
prevents
their
future
errors
is
to
reverse
their
decisions
on
appeal.
now,
i
recognize
that
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
respondents
and
the
amici
that
reversal
of
magistrate
decisions
is
not
an
adequate
corrective,
but
however
adequate
it
is
or
it
is
not
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
magistrates,
it
is
certainly
more
closely
linked
to
the
magistrate
function
than
is
the
exclusion
of
evidence,
which
imposes
the
remedy
and
its
burden
on
another
branch
of
government
and
on
society
as
a
whole.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
whatever
the
system--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
at
a
later
point
in
time,
magistrates
can
be...
their
decision
can
be
attacked
in
the
trial.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
on
the
later
occasion
when
the
evidence
either
is
or
is
not
admitted,
then
the
decision
of
the
magistrate
would
be
reviewed
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
but
it
is
not
simply
a
matter,
we
submit,
of
excluding
the
evidence.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
regardless
of
whether
there
would
or
would
not
be
the
opportunity
to
review
what
the
magistrate
has
done,
that
is
the
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
whether
the
evidence
should
be
excluded.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
a
remedy.
as
a
remedy,
it
has
its
limitations.
and
it
would
simply
be
a
mistake,
i
submit,
every
time
there
is
some
mistake
somewhere
in
the
criminal
justice
system
to
conclude
that
the
solution
is
to
exclude
some
probative
evidence.
to
use
it
as
a
device
for
correcting
judicial
error
would
just
not
be
an
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
it
would,
rather,
be
an
extension,
because
it
is
not
a
question
then
of
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
in
its
present
form
would
apply
to
the
magistrate.
it
would
involve
an
extension,
a
substantial
extension
and
an
inappropriate
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
leave
the
magistrates
aside,
because
i
am
really
a
bit
uncertain
as
to
what
extent
those
would
be
reviewable
or
not,
but
the...
or
in
exactly
what
context,
but
taking
the
issue
that
you
have
now
raised,
which
is
whether
the
adoption
of
reasonable
belief
exception
would
freeze
the
development
of
the
fourth
amendment
law,
i
think
it
is
a
legitimate
concern,
and
one
that
ought
to
be
faced.
on
its
face,
however,
i
would
note
that
it
has
to
be
taken
in
perspective,
given
the
court's
consistent
caution
against
the
unnecessary
resolution
of
constitutional
issues,
and
that
if
the
rule
is
otherwise
appropriate
for
adoption,
that
certainly
it
is
not
a
persuasive
reason
not
to
adopt
it,
because
the
consequence
would
be
that
this
court
would
have
fewer
opportunities
to
decide
constitutional
questions.
but
to
whatever
extent
it
is
a
legitimate
concern,
and
i
start
from
the
premise
that
it
is,
there
are
several
avenues
by
which
substantive
fourth
amendment
issues
will
continue
to
come
before
this
court.
three
of
those
categories
are
discussed
in
our
reply
brief,
and
in
the
interest
of
time
i
will
simply
refer
you
to
those
categories
that
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
but
i
would
emphasize
orally
that
in
addition
to
those
three
specific
categories,
the
court
is
free
to
reach
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue
before
it
reaches
the
remedial
issue
in
those
cases
where
in
the
court's
judgment
that
perfectly
logical
ordering
of
issue
consideration,
namely,
consideration
first
of
whether
there
has
been
a
substantive
fourth
amendment
violation,
and
second,
whether
there
has
been
a...
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply,
involves
only
a
prudential
use
of
the
court's
resources,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
has
done
in
several
analogous
circumstances.
in
the
harmless
error
cases,
for
example,
the
court
has
sometimes
considered
first
whether
a
wrong
was
committed,
and
sometimes
it
has
not.
those
harmless
error
cases
are
discussed
in
our
opening
brief,
both
cases
coming
out
of
this
court
and
also
out
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
respondents
really
have
not
had
any
response
or
any...
they
have
not
answered
the
persuasiveness
of
those
harmless
error
cases.
and
in
o'connor
versus
donaldson,
which
was
a
civil
damage
suit,
the
court
first
held
that
the
respondent's
confinement
was
unconstitutional,
and
then
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
petitioner's
claim
of
a
good
faith
immunity
defense
in
light
of
the
intervening
decision
handed
down
the
same
term
in
wood
versus
strickland.
now,
if
there
were
an
article
iii
constitutional
limitation
on
reaching
the
substantive
issue
in
a
case
in
which
the
remedial
issue
might
dispose
of
the
case,
you
would
have
to
overrule
both
the
harmless
error
cases
and
also
wood
versus
strickland.
the
question
therefore
concerns
the
requirements
of
judicial
prudence
and
not
of
article
iii--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
is
that
distinction,
but
they
are
alike,
justice
stevens,
in
this
sense,
that
either
of
the
grounds
would
have
disposed
of
the
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
neither
do
you
normally
decide
the
remedy
before
you
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
wrong
that
has
been
committed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
we
have
traditionally
done
it
in
this
case,
but
i
am
here
to
advise
you
that
in
doing
so...
well,
perhaps
you
should
have
followed
another
approach
in
the
interest
of
judicial
prudence,
and
that
is
really
what
it
comes
down
to.
it
is
a
question
of
judicial
prudence,
and
not
of
article
iii.
in
a
case
like
this
one,
given
gates,
it
simply
would
not
be
prudent
for
this
court
to
review
a
fact
bound
probable
cause
determination.
in
other
cases,
it
would
be
prudent
for
the
court
to
decide
important,
recurrent,
and
unsettled
substantive
fourth
amendment
questions
prior
to
reaching
the
remedy
issue,
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
prevents
it.
the
contrary
assertion,
really,
on
analysis,
would
require
overruling
this
court's
harmless
error
cases.
just
one
final
point.
it
is
very
clear,
i
submit,
that
the
respondents'
position
cannot
withstand
analysis
under
the
deterrence-based
cost
benefit
rationale
that
has
been
the
foundation
of
this
court's
exclusionary
rule
decisions
for
at
least
15
years.
the
only
rationale
which
would
deny
a
reasonable
good
faith
exception
is
one
that
would
say
that
federal
courts
simply
cannot
consider
evidence
which
has
been
tainted
by
an
unlawful
search.
it
would
be
a
per
se
rule
that
the
unlawful
search
always
disqualifies
the
evidence,
and
that
simply
is
not
the
law.
this
court's
holdings
in
alderman,
calandra,
janis,
stone
v.
powell,
havens,
and
others
show
that
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
does
not
prevent
the
courts
from
considering
all
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
indeed,
i
submit
those
cases
establish
that
it
is
just
as
offensive
to
be
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
that
facts
known
to
the
judge,
to
the
lawyers
on
both
sides,
and
to
the
defendant,
and
to
every
participant
in
the
courtroom
except
the
participants
who
need
that
information
in
order
to
perform
their
duty
is
withheld
only
from
those
people
who
do
need
it
in
order
to
perform
their
job.
and
there
is
a
larger
sense
in
which
the
imperative
of
judicial
integrity
is
involved
in
this
case.
we
pay
a
price
for
technical
rules
that
our
citizens
are
unable
to
understand
and
respect.
we
demean
the
fourth
amendment
when
its
values
depends
on
things
whose
relevance
the
common
citizen
has
a
hard
time
understanding.
people
can
understand
that
some
useful
purpose
is
served
when
evidence
obtained
in
flagrant
violation
of
a
defendant's
rights
is
suppressed.
they
have
much
more
difficulty
accepting
the
validity
of
suppression
when
it
is
done
in
response
to
a
minor
departure
from
rather
technical
and
unclear
requirements,
or
when
the
police
have
acted
in
reasonable
good
faith.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
should
not
take
that
long,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
respect
to
magistrate
shopping,
the
argument
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
an
attack
on
the
warrant
procedure
itself
and
on
this
court's
consistent
advice
that
it
has
given
over
the
years
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
search
or
not
after
the
police
have
done
their
job
should
not
be
done
by
the
police
preferably,
but
it
should
be
a
decision
that
should
be
made
by
a
neutral
judicial
officer.
nothing
has
happened
in
the
interim
to
change
the
propriety
or
the
correctness
of
that
advice.
there
is
a
limit
to
the
extent
to
which
society's
ills
can
be
cured
by
excluding
evidence.
the
advice
that
the
court
has
consistently
given
that
warrants
are
the
preferred
method
by
which
probable
cause
judgments
should
be
made
has
not
changed,
and
it
would
be
ironic
in
the
extreme
now
to
base...
now
to
reject
an
otherwise
very
sound
principle
on
the
ground
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
consistent
assumption
that
has
been
made
by
the
court
that
what
the
police
should
do
is
exactly
what
they
did
in
this
instance,
after
they
have
done
all
of
their
own
careful
work,
to
submit
that
judgment
to
a
magistrate.
now,
the
final
question
is
whether
we
really
need
this
rule.
given
the
deference
to
magistrates
on
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
issue
after
illinois
versus
gates,
we
think
that
we
do.
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
from
a
theoretical
standpoint,
at
least,
they
are
two
completely
separate
issues.
this
court
made
that
very
clear
in
illinois
versus
gates,
that
one
goes
to
the
wrong,
the
other
goes
to
the
remedy.
the
problem
here
is
with
an
exclusionary
rule
that
simply
does
not
make
sense
in
the
kind
of
case...
in
united
states
versus
leon,
massachusetts
versus
shepherd,
and
some
others.
you
do
not
correct
that
kind
of
inadequate
theory
by
adjusting
somewhere
else,
and
particularly
where
that
adjustment
is
to
a
substantive
constitutional
provision.
now,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
court
reminded
us
in
course
that
what
it
was
doing
in
gates
was
not
requiring
new
law,
but
simply
clarifying
what
had
been
the
law
all
along.
we
had
jones
and
ventresca.
we
are
not
certain
to
what
extent
the
courts
will
be
able
to
apply
with
any
greater
degree,
or
to
what
extent
there
will
be
a
real
difference
between
the
jones,
ventresca,
gates
standard
prior
to
illinois
versus
gates,
and
to
what
extent
it
will
be
different.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
a
conceptual
difference.
certainly,
certainly
there
are
cases
to
which
the
rule
that
should
arise
from
united
states
versus
leon
will
apply,
notwithstanding
illinois
versus
gates,
and
the
only
real
issue
is
how
large
the
application
of
that
rule
would
be.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
clearly
appropriate
that
such
a
rule
be
declared
to
be
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
else.
