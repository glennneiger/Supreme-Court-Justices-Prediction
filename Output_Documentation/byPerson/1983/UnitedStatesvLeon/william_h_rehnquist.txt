justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
haven't
challenged
here
the
ninth
circuit's
determination
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
only
question
you
present
in
your
petition
is
the
good
faith
rule.
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
i
may
interrupt--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
assume
that
is
usually
the
case.
in
the
city
of
tampa
case
ten
years
ago,
we
said
it
was
all
right
for
a
city
clerk
to
be
a
magistrate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
one
appeal
from
the
finding
of
a
magistrate?
are
you
talking
now
about
the
challenge
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence?
is
that
what
you
consider
the
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
search
warrants
are
issued
ex
parte.
at
least
they
always
were
in
my
experience.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
lee,
one
of
the
arguments
your
opponents
make
to
the
adoption
of
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusion
rule
is
that
it
would
prevent
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
law
because
the
typical
judge
at
a
suppression
hearing,
faced
with
the
question
of,
was
there
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
was
it
in
good
faith
and
reasonable,
is
going
to
answer
the
question,
it
was
in
good
faith
and
reasonable,
and
so
we
don't
have
to
get
to
the...
now,
if
you
don't
feel
there
is
a
lot
of
fourth
amendment
law
that
needs
to
be
developed
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
only
one
sentence
in
the
constitution,
that
may
not
bother
you
much,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
does
kind
of
go
against
your
idea
that
magistrates'
findings
are
somehow
reviewable
in
some
other
forum,
you
know
not
where,
is,
i
guess,
what
your
answer
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
either
something
wrong
with
them
or
something
wrong
with
the
law,
i
suppose,
if
they
couldn't
get
it
right
in
a
month.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
a
magistrate,
would
you
have
issued
this
warrant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
a
reasonable
magistrate
could
have
issued
this
warrant
after--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--after
illinois
against
gates?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
but
after
illinois.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
all
probable
cause
is
is
a
certain
degree
of
association,
and
there
is
no
magic
cutoff
point
between
what...
the
court
of
appeals
there
was
just
as
consistent
with
innocence
as
guilt.
all
the
strands
that
go
to
make
up
probable
cause
are
often
just
as
consistent
with
innocence
as
they
are
with
guilt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
association
with
a
narcotics
dealer,
being
seen
with
him
is
some
evidence
that
you
may
have
some
propensities
of
that
kind
yourself.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
true
under
illinois
against
gates
now?
