justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
lee,
i
guess
this
case
was
decided
before
illinois
versus
gates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
record
in
this
case
establish
that
the
police
actually
had
information
available
about
the
reliability
and
credibility
of
the
informer?
was
that
information
available
to
them,
according
to
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
does
it
do
to
encourage
proper
action
by
the
magistrate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
understand
how
that
would
come
up.
if
the
purpose
of
changing
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
admit
the
evidence,
i
fail
to
see
how
you
would
ever
have
occasion
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
magistrate's
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cossack,
if
the
thrust
of
the
fourth
amendment
inquiry
is
probable
cause,
what
about
the
case
where
there
is
in
fact
probable
cause
but
the
magistrate
simply
makes
some
kind
of
a
mistake
or
error,
a
slip
of
the
pen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
no
room
there
for
any
kind
of
a
so-called
good
faith
exception
for
the
officer
executing
such
a
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
maybe
even
decided
there
was
and
made
some
error
on
the
warrant.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
good
faith
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
case,
then,
where
there
is
in
fact
probable
cause
but
the
police
officer
made
an
error
in
filling
out
the
affidavit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
magistrate
acts
on
it
erroneously
and
issues
a
warrant.
now,
is
that
a
case
where
is
room
for
an
exception?
