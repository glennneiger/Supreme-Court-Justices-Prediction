mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
by
just
listing
some
basic
things
about
this
case
that
are
not
disputed
to
put
it
in
context.
first,
the
officers
lawfully
acquired
probable
cause
to
arrest
both
petitioners
and
to
believe
that
there
was
a
substantial
quantity
of
cocaine
in
their
apartment.
second,
the
officers
did
not
immediately
conduct
a
warrantless
search
of
the
apartment
on
the
basis
of
this
information.
rather,
they
consulted
with
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
then
staked
out
the
apartment
for
the
purpose
of
apprehending
petitioners
and
preventing
possible
destruction
of
the
evidence.
third,
the
officers
lawfully
arrested
the
petitioner
segura
when
he
arrived
at
the
apartment
at
11
p.m.
fourth,
the
officers
then
entered
the
apartment
because
they
believed
that
such
action
was
necessary
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
we
do
not
dispute
here
they
had
an
insufficient
basis
for
concluding
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances
justifying
a
warrantless
entry
and,
therefore,
their
entry
did
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
fifth,
when
the
officers
entered
they
conducted
only
a
limited
security
search
and
not
a
full
evidentiary
search.
some
evidence
was
found
at
the
time
of
this
limited
security
search,
and
that
has
been
suppressed,
but
nothing
seen
during
this
initial
search
contributed
in
any
way
to
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
sixth,
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
including
petitioner
colon
were
arrested
and
removed
from
the
premises.
seventh,
subsequently
19
hours
later
a
valid
warrant
issued
and
the
search
under
its
authority
uncovered
the
evidence
at
issue
in
this
case.
now
i
think
it
is
black
letter
law.
i
do
not
understand
anybody
to
really
dispute
it
although
i
am
not
sure
that
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
operate
on
fourth
amendment
violations
in
the
abstract.
rather,
it
calls
for
the
suppression
of
evidence
that
is
sufficiently
connected
to
or
produced
by
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
now
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
discovered
and
seized
during
the
execution
of
a
valid
and
untainted
search
warrant
issued
by
a
judicial
officer
on
a
showing
of
lawfully
acquired
probable
cause.
now
the
events
surrounding
this
transaction
also
did
include
an
unlawful
entry
into
the
premises
where
the
evidence
was
ultimately
found,
but
the
second
circuit
concluded
and
we
submit
to
this
court
that
there
was
no
sufficient
connection
between
the
illegality
and
the
acquisition
of
the
evidence.
two
theories
have
been
advanced
to
get
around
the
simplicity
and
i
think
compelling
nature
of
our
position.
the
first
is
petitioners'
theory
that
there
was
somehow
an
unlawful
seizure
of
this
evidence
in
the
course
of
the
illegal
entry
and
that
this
made
it
primary
evidence
not
subject
to
any
fruits
analysis
and,
therefore,
not
requiring
a
connection
between
the
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
the
second
is
the
theory
of
the
district
court
that
there
was
a
causal
connection.
that
is,
there
was
a
hypothetical
causal
connection
because
had
the
illegal
entry
not
occurred
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
might
have
destroyed
the
evidence.
now
i
want
to
discuss
both
these
theories
because
i
do
not
think
they
stand
up.
but
in
order
to
make
the
case
simpler
i
would
like
to
start
with
looking
at
the
situation
in
which
the
house
was
empty
because
i
think
that
would
make
our
position
clear
in
its
pristine
form.
if
the
officers
enter
an
empty
house
it
is
still
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
they
do
not
have
a
warrant
or
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
with
a
place
of
business
there
would
be
a
question
as
to
what
the
zone
of
privacy
or
private
areas
are,
but
they
would
require
a
warrant
or
exigent
circumstances
in
private
areas
of
a
place
of
business
as
a
home.
i
mean,
i
think
the
court
has
held
that.
i
do
not
think
that
is
an
issue
here.
the
point
is
that
they
would
illegally
enter
the
home
then
some
time
later
the
warrant
would
issue.
they
would
conduct
their
search.
they
would
find
the
evidence.
i
do
not
see
any
conceivable
way
in
those
circumstances
in
which
it
can
be
said
that
the
evidence
is
a
fruit
of
the
unlawful
entry.
so
unless
the
court
is
going
to
totally
abandon
the
notion
that
there
does
have
to
be
a
connection
between
the
illegality
and
the
evidence
that
is
sought
to
be
admitted
at
trial
at
least
in
the
empty
house
situation--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
think
the
record
reflects.
let
me
address
the
19
hour
point
because...
i
do
not
defend
the
police
staying
inside
the
apartment
after
the
premises
were
secured.
i
believe
that
that
is
not
a
justifiable
or
reasonable
action
because
it
is
not
necessary,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
is
a
continuing
search
while
they
are
in
there.
the
whole
point
of
why
they
cannot
enter
without
a
warrant
is
that
that
entry
constitutes
a
search,
not
a
seizure
but
a
search
of
the
premises.
so
i
do
not
defend
their
staying
in.
in
my
opinion
once
they
had
removed
the
occupants
of
the
apartment
they
should
have
gone
outside
and
waited
outside
the
door.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
anything--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
one
would
be
civil
liability
if
the
court
made
it
clear
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
stay
inside
once
the
premises
were
secured.
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
about
the
19
hours
because
i
think
it
is
critical
to
this
case
is
that
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
if
they
stayed
inside
or
outside
during
the
19
hours
that
cannot
possibly
have
any
connection
with
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
under
the
warrant.
as
long
as
they
were
entitled
to
secure
the
premises
from
the
outside
which
i
do
not
understand
my
opponent
to
dispute,
it
is
just
an
illegality
hanging
in
the
air.
it
is
still
the
same
thing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
the
difference
resides
in
seizure
doctrine.
first
of
all,
the
concept
of
seizure
that
my
colleague
has
come
up
with
has
no
background
in
this
court's
decisions,
the
notion
that
when
you
impound
a
house
and
prevent
people
from
going
in
that
constitutes
a
seizure
of
every
item
of
the
house's
contents--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--no.
i
mean
there
may
be
an
abstract
or
theoretical
sense
in
which
there
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
would
be.
i
think
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
in
part
but
to
the
extent
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
is
a
seizure
of
the
house
that
seizure
is
permissible
if
done
from
the
outside
while
you
are
procuring
a
warrant
in
order
to
prevent
people
from
entering
and
removing
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
even
if
it
is
labeled
seizure.
a
seizure--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--unreasonable--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
what--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
could
conceive
of
somebody
saying
it,
yes,
and
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
that
where
they
enter
the
house
without
exigent
circumstances
they
are
committing
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
my
opinion
the
fourth
amendment
violation
they
are
committing
is
illegal
search--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--not
with
respect
to
seizure.
i
do
not
think
you
could
label
it
any
more
unreasonable
seizure.
the
problem
is
that
while
they
are
sitting
in
the
house
they
may
be
going
to
the
refrigerator
and
getting
a
beer,
looking
around,
seeing
things
that
were
not
evident
to
them
during
their
initial
entry,
and
of
course
if
they
see
things
during
this
19
hours
that
they
are
there
that
is
evidence
of
a
crime
then
under
the
second
circuit's
rule
they
would
not
be
able
to
use
that.
so
they
do
have
some
incentive
to
get
out,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
furthering
their
investigative
goals
in
the
case
they
have
virtually
no
incentive
to
stay
in
because
the
purpose
was
to
secure
the
premises.
once
that
purpose
is
accomplished
you
can
equally
well
secure
the
premises
by
posting--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
assume
the
corridors
of
this
apartment
building
were
also
heated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
actually--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
would
be...
if
they
in
addition
had
sufficient
reason
to
believe
there
was
a
danger
of
destruction
of
the
narcotics
they
could
make
an
entry
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
destruction
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
equally
whether
the
legal...
whether
the
initial
entry
was
legal
or
illegal
does
not
relate
to
whether
it
is
illegal
for
them
to
continue
staying
here,
but
i
think
this
whole
19
hour
business
is
a
complete
red
herring
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it
has
never
been
suggested,
and
i
do
not
understand
how
it
could
be
what
relationship
the
19
hours
has
to
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
it
is
though
they
took
segura
down
to
the
station
house
and
beat
a
confession
out
of
him.
it
would
be
shocking
and
improper
but
it
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
the
entry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
the
record
shows
is
that
they
entered
at
11
o'clock
at
night.
they
arrested
the
people.
the
next
morning
they
went
in
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
there
was
a
discussion
with
the
ausa
in
which
the
agent
in
charge
related
the
facts
for
the
purposes
of
preparation
of
a
search
warrant
affidavit.
most
of
the
day
was
then
taken
up
with
the
process
of
booking
and
the
initial
appearance
of
the
suspects,
appointment
of
counsel,
bail,
all
of
those
matters.
so
i
do
not
think
the
19
hours
is
as
bad
as
it
sounds.
i
do
not
have
a
problem
with
the
19
hours.
i
do
have
a
problem
with
staying
in
the
apartment
for
whatever
period
of
time
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
let
me
turn
to--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
my
colleague
has
not
really
relied
on
that
theory,
but
i
will
turn
from
the
seizure
theory
which
seems
to
me
quite
untenable
for
the
moment
to
this
more
traditional
fruits
kind
of
inquiry
that
you
are
suggesting
which
is
that
the
possibility
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
destroyed
before
they
got
a
warrant
suggests
that
the
evidence
found
under
the
warrant
should
be
treated
as
a
fruit
if
i
understand
your
question.
now
i
have
several
responses
to
that,
and
this
is
a
little
bit
like
the
flip
side
of
the
inevitable
discovery
cases
where
what
you
are
dealing
with
is
a
hypothetical
independent
source.
the
evidence
was
actually
found
during
an
illegal
search,
but
the
government
can
hypothesize
that
it
would
have
been
discovered
in
any
event.
here
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot,
and
it
is
the
defendant
who
is
hypothesizing
that
the
evidence
would
have
been
destroyed
had
the
entry
not
been
made.
now
there
are
a
couple
of
problems
with
that.
first
is
that
the
destruction
of
evidence
is
a
crime.
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
to
aid
offenders
in
the
destruction
of
evidence
to
prevent
the
uncovery
of
their
acts.
and
i
do
not
believe
as
a
matter
of
exclusionary
rule
policy
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
treat
the
possibility
of
destruction
of
evidence
where
that
is
the
sole
hypothetical
nexus
between
the
illegality
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
as
a
causal
connection
which
bridges
the
gap
and
transmits
the
taint
to
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
illegal
i
think
to
remove
or
destroy
for
purposes
of
evading--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
crime
if
it
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
removing
evidence
from...
in
any
event
the
entry
did
not
prevent
them
from
removing
the
evidence.
they
were
not
going
to
be
able
to
remove
any
evidence
in
any
event...
prevented
them
from
destroying
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
they
were
staking
out
the
place
from
the
outside.
if
colon
who
was
in
the
apartment
had
left
they
could
have
arrested
her.
they
had
probable
cause
to
do
so.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
necessarily.
that
would
depend
on
the
facts.
anybody
in
the
apartment?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
pawlings
v.
kentucky
the
court
adverted
to
but
did
not
decide
the
question,
and
in
michigan
v.
summers
i
think
the
court
suggested
that
they
could
require
people
not
to
leave
unless
they
would
agree
to
subject
themselves
to
a
search.
the
question
is
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
given
the
officers'
possession
of
probable
cause.
let's
not
forget
in
all
of
this
that
at
all
times
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
a
half
kilogram
of
cocaine.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mincey
v.
arizona.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
illinois
v.
sandreyas.
i
think
the
question
in
these
circumstances
is
what
is
reasonable
during
the
time
when
the
officers
are
procuring
a
warrant
in
terms
of
immobilizing
the
premises,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
questions.
i
do
not
think
this
court
has
by
any
means
explored
all
of
the
ramifications
of
this
issue,
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
another
feature
of
allowing
the
potential
destruction
of
the
evidence
to
be
used
as
establishing
a
causal
connection
which
is
noteworthy
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
noted.
that
is
the
adherent
contradiction
or
irony
in
saying
that
on
the
one
hand
the
entry
was
illegal
because
there
was
no
sufficient
danger
of
destruction
of
the
evidence,
yet
on
the
other
hand
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
was
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
entry
because
it
would
have
been
destroyed
had
the
officers
not
entered.
now
the
result
of
this
approach
is
to
penalize
the
officers
for
being
right
about
the
dangers
of
evidentiary
destruction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
fact
that
an
illegal
entry
has
been
made
would
be
the
critical
question.
i
mean,
i
think
there
is
because
the
standard
of
reasonableness
governs
fourth
amendment
inquiries
there
is
a
question
about
the
length
of
time
that
it
is
reasonable
to
impound
property
or
to
exercise
dominion
over
somebody's
home,
and
it
would
depend
on
the
purposes,
what
the
officers
were
doing
during
that
time,
what
their
purposes
were,
what
they
in
fact--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--there
would
probably
be...
just
compensation
clause
might
be
applicable
to
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
reluctant
to
say
that
it
wouldn't.
certainly
if
the
causal
connection
between
the
entry
and
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
is,
for
instance,
not
due
to
any
crime
but
due
to
the
cleaning
woman
throwing
it
out
or
something
like
that
then
you
do
not
have
the
same
problem
of
using
this
rationale
of
kind
of
subverting
the
fourth
amendment
into
a
purpose
that
is
not
its
purpose.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
ordinarily
30
days
would
be--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
it
would
be
unreasonable.
whether
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
right
way
to
analyze
it
i
am
not
certain,
and
i
point
out
that
the
19
hours
is
not
a
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
the
two
people
who
were
entitled
to
access
to
the
apartment
were
both
subject
to
the
arrest,
and
they
were
both
in
jail.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
both
arrested.
while
the
arrest
of
colon
would
be
invalid
under
payton
v.
new
york
because
it
entailed
a
search
of
her
home
in
entering
the
premises,
the
actual
seizure
of
her
person
is
not
illegal
because
a
warrant
is
not
required
under
watson.
so
i
do
not
think
the
magistrate
if
he
were
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
at
an
initial
appearance
would
be
justified
in
releasing
her
simply
because
the
arrest
had
been
accompanied
by
an
unlawful
search
of
her
house.
the
remedy
for
the
unlawful
search
of
her
house
is
to
exclude
any
evidence
discovered
in
the
course
of
that
unlawful
search.
now
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
seizure
theory
for
a
moment.
i
have
a
little
difficulty
dealing
with
it
because
it
strikes
me
that
my
opponent's
argument
is
something
of
an
ipse
dixit,
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
get
an
analytical
handle
on
it.
the
assertion
that
the
primary
evidence-secondary
evidence
distinction
is
relevant
here
which
is
an
attempt
to
find
some
kind
of
pigeon
hole
in
fourth
amendment
analysis
that
he
can
fit
his
case
into
seems
to
me
completely
out
of
place.
the
whole
concept
of
distinguishing
between
primary
and
secondary
evidence
is
derived
in
the
course
of
a
search
which
reveals
some
evidence
immediately
and
which
leads
to
other
evidence.
now
i
can
give
you
an
example
in
the
case
of
a
seizure
to
show
that
it
is
misplaced
here.
let
us
suppose
that
somebody
leaves
his
property
at
a
hotel
check
room
and
goes
out
of
town
for
two
days
and
the
police
without
probable
cause
seize
his
briefcase
but
they
do
not
open
it
and
then
before
the
fellow
returns
to
town
they
acquire
probable
cause,
go
to
the
magistrate,
get
a
warrant
and
search
the
suitcase.
i
do
not
see
any
difficulty
at
all
with
applying
a
fruits
analysis
with
asking
the
question
whether
the
fact
that
they
had
seized
it
and
had
it
in
their
possession
rather
than
having
it
left
at
the
hotel
check
room
contributed
to
the
discovery
of
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
some
after-acquired
information
which
gives
probable
cause.
after
they
seize
it
an
informant
calls
up
and
says
john
doe
has
left
his
briefcase
full
of--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes
and
assuming
there
is
probable
cause
and
they
got
a
warrant.
my
point
is
just
that
this
notion
that
if
it
is
somehow
seized
then
it
automatically
is
primary
evidence
and
you
just
do
not
have
to
apply
a
fruits
analysis
is
quite
mistaken.
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
notion
is
that
the
minute
the
police
stick
their
nose
inside
the
house
and
seize
it
they
have
committed
a
violation
which
is
treated
the
same
way
as
if
they
went
through
the
house,
opened
every
desk
drawer,
removed
every
paper
and
item
of
property,
loaded
it
into
a
van
and
took
it
off
all
without
a
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
then
you
would
apply
a
fruits
analysis
and
you
would
determine
that
it
was...
but
my
point
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--except
for
the
fact
that
they
could
have
kept
the
cleaning
woman
out
from
outside.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
one
can
imagine--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--this
is
not
a
shooting
gallery.
this
is
a
high-class,
large
scale
cocaine
distribution
operation.
i
mean,
these
people
have
$50,000
in
cash.
that
is
one
of
the
items
in
evidence
in
issue
here.
he
had
just
distributed
a
half
a
kilo
of
cocaine.
he
had
three
pounds
more
in
his
apartment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
cleaning
people
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
is
treated
as
a
residence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
recall
that
there
was
any,
and
i
would
not
ask
the
court
to
rest
its
decision
in
this
case
on
the
notion
that
this
is
a
place
of
business
because
i
believe
even
as
a
place
of
business
it
has
protection
from
the
warrant
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
the
same.
we
are
not
here
to
dispute
whether
the
entry
into
the
premises
without
a
warrant
was
lawful.
that
is
a
given
of
this
case
that
it
was
not
lawful.
the
reason
we
discuss
that
issue
in
our
brief--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
were
not
exigent
circumstances--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--huh?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
not
challenged
that.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
one
mistake
in
its
analysis
which
we
did
not
mention
in
our
brief
which
is
that
when
they
went
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
colon
opened
the
door
they
then
knew
before
they
had
committed
any
fourth
amendment
violation
that
the
apartment
was
occupied.
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
of
no
exigent
circumstances
did
not
rest
solely
on
that
but
rested
also
on
the
lack
of
sufficient
probability
if
they
had
just
arrested
segura
and
taken
him
away
that
the
occupants
would
have
destroyed
the
evidence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i
was
saying
the
only
reason
we
discussed
that
point
in
our
brief
is
because
my
opponent
tries
to
make
much
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
flagrant
or
egregious
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
want
to
get
to
the
point
about
if
we
are
going
to
worry
about
deterrents
in
the
air
should
we
just
abandon
the
court's
normal
principles
of
requiring
a
nexus
between
the
evidence
and
the
illegality
because
something
that
has
concerned
some
courts
a
rule
that
would
allow
the
use
of
evidence
in
a
case
like
this
may
unduly
encourage
the
police
to
engage
in
fourth
amendment
violations.
there
are
several
things
to
be
said
about
that.
the
first
is
that
this
is
a
situation
which
does
not
inherently...
the
rule
for
which
we
contend
does
not
inherently
lend
itself
to
encouraging
flagrant
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
the
more
clear
it
is
to
the
police
that
there
are
no
exigent
circumstances
the
less
they
have
to
gain
by
entering
the
premises
rather
than
waiting
for
the
warrant
which
they
fully
believe
they
have
probable
cause
to
get
and
will
get.
when
they
enter
the
premises
they
can
only
have
the
benefit
of
evidence
that
is
held
not
to
be
a
fruit
of
the
entry
so
under
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
earlier
they
still
run
the
substantial
risk
that
evidence
that
is
found
during
the
original
unlawful
entry
if
it
is
unlawful
will
be
suppressed.
in
addition,
the
problem
of
flagrant
violations
is
an
area
where
civil
liability
is
a
meaningful
remedy.
that
is,
the
risk
of
encouraging
flagrant
violations
is
attenuated
or
offset
by
the
fact
that
if
it
is
flagrant
there
is
potential
civil
liability.
now
i
think
that
is
all
i
have
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
thank
you.
