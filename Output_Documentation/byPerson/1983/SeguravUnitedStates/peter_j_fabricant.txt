mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
february
12,
1981
law
enforcement
officials
forceably
entered
the
home
of
the
petitioners.
at
the
time
of
the
entry
the
police
had
no
search
warrant
or
arrest
warrant
nor
the
consent
of
any
of
the
occupants.
no
exigent
circumstances
existed
which
could
justify
the
actions
of
the
police.
the
only
excuse
for
the
entry
was
the
belief
by
the
police
that
contraband
was
concealed
within
the
dwelling.
having
once
violated
the
privacy
of
the
home
the
police
removed
all
of
the
occupants
and
remained
there
by
themselves
for
a
continuous
period
of
some
19
hours.
thereafter
the
police
obtained
a
search
warrant
based
on
knowledge
they
possessed
many
hours
before
the
entry
and
occupation,
and
upon
execution
of
the
warrant
contraband
was
discovered
secreted
within
the
premises.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
that
contraband
should
be
suppressed.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
unlawful
entry
into,
seizure
and
19
hour
continuous
occupation
of
the
petitioners'
home
constituted
a
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
not
only
of
the
home
but
of
its
contents.
since
the
actions
of
the
police
constituted
a
seizure
of
the
contraband
before
the
search
warrant
was
ever
obtained
any
doctrine
of
attenuation
under
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
apply
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
achieved
by
its
application
here.
the
facts
are
not
in
doubt.
on
february
12,
1981
in
new
york
city
at
about
5:30
in
the
afternoon
the
police
observed
what
appeared
to
them
to
be
a
drug
transaction
on
the
streets
of
queens,
new
york.
at
6:30,
an
hour
later,
they
telephoned
the
united
states
attorneys'
office
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
to
make
inquiries
about
perhaps
arresting
the
petitioners
and
getting
a
search
warrant
to
search
their
apartment
in
queens,
new
york.
they
were
told
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
at
6:30
in
the
evening
that
the
magistrate
was
not
around,
and
he
suggested
or
directed
the
police
to
go
to
the
premises,
the
apartment
building,
to
arrest
the
petitioners
if
they
saw
them
and
to
secure
the
premises
from
the
outside.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
further
directed
the
agents
not
to
enter
the
apartment
unless
exigent
circumstances
should
occur.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
it
occurred
in
queens,
new
york,
part
of
new
york
city.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no.
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
there
are
14
district
court
judges
and
4
magistrates.
there
is
always
a
district
court
judge
that
is
on
emergency
duty
and
available
to
sign
warrants
at
any
time,
and
there
is
also
one
of
the
four
magistrates
is
also
on
emergency
duty
so
as
to
sign
warrants.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
it
was
not
a
holiday.
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
week.
it
was
not
a
friday
or
a
holiday,
your
honor,
or
the
weekend.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
when
he
finally
signed
the
warrant
the
next
day?
perhaps
not.
i
think
under
franks
v.
delaware
he
might
be
able
to
remove
whatever
taint
there
might
be.
i
mention
in
my
brief
the
fact,
justice
blackmun,
that
the
agents
did
not
19
hours
late
when
they
applied
for
the
warrant
did
not
say
in
their
affidavit
that
they
had
entered
the
premises.
i
say
that
as
an
example
of
the
egregious
conduct
of
the
police.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
a
warrant
was
eventually
signed
and
it
was
based
on
the
information
that
the
police
had
before
they
entered
the
apartment.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
yes,
as
has
been
so
held
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
but
i
believe,
justice
powell,
that
it
is
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
who
in
the
first
instance
must
make
the
determination
of
probable
cause.
i
think
one
of
the
main
problems
in
this
case
is
that
the
police,
sure,
they
had
a
great
deal
of
suspicion
that
there
was
contraband
in
the
apartment,
but
the
constitution
and
really
all
of
the
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
dwellings
say
that
absent
exigent
circumstances
the
police
must
get
a
warrant
before
they
cross
the
threshold
of
the
premises.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
it
is
different
because
it
is
in
a
home
where
one
has
the
highest
expectation
of
privacy.
in
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
in
united
states
v.
chadwick...
well,
chadwick
dealt
with
a
footlocker
that
i
believe
was
being
put
into
an
automobile
and
arkansas
v.
sanders
dealt
with
a
suitcase
which
was
in
an
automobile
or
being
carried
around
by
somebody
outside.
the
difference
is
i
believe
twofold.
first
of
all,
the
actions
of
the
police
in
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
united
states
v.
chadwick
in
the
seizure
might
be
considered
as
reasonable
because
under
the
circumstances
the
mobility
of
the
suitcase
and
the
footlocker
would
mean
that
if
they
went
to
get
a
warrant
the
automobiles
and
the
suitcases
with
the
possible
contraband
in
them
would
not
be
around
any
more.
the
other
difference
is
that
in
sanders
and
chadwick
the
police
were
at
a
place
and
in
a
position
where
they
had
an
absolute
right
to
be.
they
were
not
in
somebody's
house.
they
were
out
in
the
public.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
yes.
that
would
have
been
much
more
reasonable.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
would
be
a
closer
question.
i
think
that
since--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--it
would
be
a
closer
question
as
to...
well,
it
would
be
invalid
because
i
think
that--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--the
subsequent
warrant
would
still
be
invalid
because
i
think
what
the
fourth
amendment
seeks
to
protect
more
than
anything
else
is
the
physical
entry
into
the
home,
but
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
would
be...
and
they
stayed
outside?
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
that
would...
they
would
be
in
a
place
where
they
had
a
right
to
be.
that
would
be
the
difference.
their
entry
would
have
been
legal.
their
remaining
there
after
the
exigency
has
terminated
would
be
a
violation
of
the
privacy
of
the
home,
but
at
least
their
initial
entry
would
have
been
all
right.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
and
the
subsequent
warrant
might
very
well
have
been
valid.
it
is
my
argument
may
it
please
the
court
that
even
should
this
court
find
that
an
initial
illegal
entry
and
then
withdrawal
and
the
waiting
outside
does
not
constitute
a
seizure
of
the
later
discovered
contraband.
i
submit
that
the
entry
and
the
remaining
inside
once
even
any
feeling
of
exigency
has
been
dissipated
equals
a
continuous
deprivation
of
the
rights
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
absolutely
not.
i
think
united
states
v.
johnson...
johnson
v.
united
states,
mcdonald
v.
united
states
this
court
has
said
you
cannot
unless
you
have
emergency
or
exigent
circumstances
go
into
a
house
without
a
warrant.
in,
for
example,
johnson
v.
united
states
the
police
smelled
opium
in
hotel
room,
the
odor
order
of
opium,
and
they
went
in
there
and
grabbed
the
opium.
in
mcdonald
v.
united
states
they
heard
slot
machines
or
some
sound
of
gambling
devices
and
they
went
in
and
seized
the
gambling
devices.
i
do
not
think
the
opening
or
not
opening
of
a
parcel
is
relevant
when
the
police
are
in
somebody's
home
where
they
have
no
right
to
be
to
seize
the
parcel.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
believe
that
they
could.
it
would
be--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--if
they
acted
reasonably
it
would
be--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--on
the
grounds
that
they
are
securing
the
premises.
they
are
not
entering
the
premises.
they
are
securing
the
premises
from
the
outside
and
they
do
not
want
people
to
go
in
and
disturb
what
might
be
in
there.
they
would
have
more
of
a
reasonable
right
to
do
that.
the
result
would
be
the
same.
they
are
staying
outside
or
going
inside,
but
if
they
stay
outside
then
the
privacy
of
the
home
has
not
been
violated--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--that
is
right.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
there
is
no
difference
in
that
respect.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no.
there
is
no
difference
in
the
movement
of
people
in
and
out
of
the
apartment,
but
there
is
a
difference
concerning
your
invasion
of
privacy
of
what
is
inside
your
dwelling.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no,
i
do
not
believe,
justice
white,
that
you
have
to
say
that
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
don't
think
that
the
warrant
and
the
discovery
of
the
contraband
is
secondary
evidence.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
correct.
it
rested
on
the
knowledge
that
the
police
had
before
they
entered
the
apartment.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
absolutely...
and
was.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
i
think
that
depends
on
your
definition
of
seizure.
it
is
my
contention
that
the
illegal
entry
coupled
with
the
19
hour
occupation
equals
a
seizure
not
only
of
what
they
saw
in
open
view
but
of
what
they
suspected
was
there
but
had
not
yet
discovered.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
it
might
have
been
destroyed.
it
might
have
gone
somewhere
else.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no,
that
is
not
the
only
reason.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
the
reason
is
that
to
allow
the
entry
without
a
search
warrant
i
think
you
are
assuming
that
because
the
police
feel--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--what
is
that?
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
by
not
suppressing--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--well,
nobody
is
denying
that.
but
by
allowing
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
entry
even
that
which
was
in
an
attache
case
and
which
was
not
open
until
a
valid
warrant
appeared
is
i
think
dissipating
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
into
a
home?
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
yes.
i
think
a
home
more
than
anything
else,
more
than
a
car,
more
than
anything
else.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
highest
degree
of
privacy
was--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--yes.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
it
probably
would
have
still
been
there
even
if
they
had
secured
the
premises.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
they
do
not
really
get
an
advantage.
the
people
get
a
disadvantage
and
their
right
of
privacy
in
a
home
has
been
violated.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
police
to
do
what
they
did
here.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
involving
what
some
commentators
call
the
impoundment
of
homes
but
not
that
many
cases,
and
i
believe
that
the
reason
that
there
have
not
been
that
many
cases
is
that
it
is
black
letter
law
that
absent
exigent
circumstances
the
police
cannot
go
into
your
home.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
they
had
five
hours
to
do
so.
yes,
i
believe
they
do.
they
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
they
had
the
time.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
yes,
it
was
because
they
presented
that
same
information
19
hours
after
the
illegal
entry.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
but
they
did
not
put
them
in
their
affidavit
for
the
warrant.
they
only
put
in
their
affidavit
what
they
knew
at
the
time
that
they
determined
in
their
own
mind
that
they
had
probable
cause.
they
did
not
put
in
their
affidavit
that
they
entered
the
apartment
and
saw
some
other
contraband
in
open
view
which
would
even
have
given
them
more
probable
cause.
so
i
think
it
is
clear
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
before
they
entered.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
if
that
is
so
then
they
are
not
supposed
to
go
in.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
think
the
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
particularly
the
warrant
clause
as
applied
to
homes
is
that
it
is
not
a
determination
to
be
made
in
the
first
instance
by
law
enforcement
officers,
by
police.
the
question
of
probable
cause
in
the
very
first
instance
is
to
be
made
by
a
magistrate.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
consequences
obviously...
i
have
said
so
in
my
brief.
the
consequences
should
be
the
suppression
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
all
the
evidence
they
discovered
was.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
enough
of
a
deterrent
to
deter
the
police
from
illegal
entry
in
homes
because
in
a
great
deal
of
situations
contraband
is
not
on
kitchen
tables.
it
is
not
on
desks.
it
is
secreted.
the
mere
penalty
of
depriving
the
government
of
the
use
of
those
objects
which
were
seen
in
open
view
upon
the
illegal
entry
of
the
police
would
not
in
my
opinion
be
enough
of
a
deterrent.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
they
admit
that
it
is
not
an
issue
but
then
they
do
argue
that
it
is
legal.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
because
the--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--well,
it
is
the
end
of
their
position,
but
i
do
not
agree
with
it.
there
is
a--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--that
would
be
the
result
if
the
convictions
were
affirmed,
and
i
submit
that
the
warrant
clause
would
almost
disappear.
the
police
would
always
in
the
future
secure
premises
from
the
inside,
and
that
is
what
the
constitution
is
designed
to
protect--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--but
that
is
a
clearly
defined
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
hot
pursuit.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
not
from
the
inside.
from
the
outside,
yes,
but
once
they
cross
the
threshold
and
are
on
the
inside
then
they
are
there
in
this
particular
case
for
19
hours
having
removed
all
the
occupants
and
are
there
alone
to
use
their
discretion
for
the
19
hours.
the
potential
for
mischief
of
their
being
there
for
the
19
hours
is
something
which
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
consider,
the
potential
for
mischief.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
agent
in
this
case
peeked
or--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
it
would
have
still
been
a
violation,
but
it
would
have
been
less
of
a
violation.
perhaps
this
court--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--you
mean
at
the
trial
level?
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no,
but
this
court
might
feel,
for
example,
because
of
the
easily
disposable
nature
of
narcotics
which
was
the
contraband
in
this
case
that
the
police
should
be
able
to
secure
a
premises
from
the
inside.
but
if
that
is
so
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
say
that
can
only
be
done
for
the
absolute
minimum
amount
of
time
necessary
to
secure
a
search
warrant.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
that
is
my
position.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
would
be
here--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--i
would
still
be
here,
but
i
think
i
would
have
less
of
a
potent
argument.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
because
this
court
in
recent
years
has
not
automatically
applied
the
exclusionary
rule.
it
has
applied
the
rule
when
its
purposes
would
be
best
achieved.
a
five
minute
entry,
running
in,
securing
and
running
out
although
it
involves
a
crossing
of
the
threshold
is
a
lot
different
than
a
10
hour
continuous
occupation.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
no,
it
does
not...
the
entry
is
still
illegal,
but
when
they
have
been
there
particularly
longer
than
the
time
necessary
to
get
a
warrant
and
they--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--that
is
correct,
but
it
is
more
egregious
the
longer
they
are
there.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
yes,
i
do.
mr.
peter
j.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
whether
this
was
a
residence
the
evidence
presented
at
the
district
court
was
that
the
police
had
been
surveilling
and
trailing
these
two
people
for
about
a
month.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
police
officer,
an
undercover
officer,
assisted
in
moving
these
people
from
one
apartment
in
queens
to
another.
it
is
clear
and
the
court
below,
the
district
court,
assumed
correctly
that
it
was
a
residence.
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
seizing
the
apartment
from
the
outside
and
seizing
it--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--yes.
i
think
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
highest
expectation
of
privacy
is
in
a
home
more
so
than
an
automobile
or
i
would
even
say
a
business
although
you
certainly
do
have
a
high
expectation
of
privacy
in
your
office.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
but
not
so
much
as
the
home.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
would
think
that
if
that
could
be
shown
by
the
prosecution
then
your
expectation
of
privacy
might
be
lessened
at
least
somewhat.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
there
was
no
evidence
or
it
was
not
propounded
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
was
a
place
of
business
disguised
as
a
home.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
well,
the
decisions
of
this
court
dealing
with
the
constitution
do
not
just
deal
with
criminals.
they
deal
with
all
of
us.
certainly
we
want
to
be
able
to
have
the
police
catch
criminals
and
seize
evidence.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
perhaps
because
home
is
mentioned
in
the
fourth
amendment.
place
of
business
is
not.
it
would
be
perhaps
a
slighter
less
degree
of
expectation
of
privacy.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
much
less.
it
is
just
that
this
court
has
always
stressed
that
the
home
has
the
highest
degree
of
expectation;
therefore,
perhaps
an
office
has
a
slightly
less
degree.
certainly
even
a
criminal
committing
crimes
in
his
or
her
home
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
police
will
not
violate
the
privacy
of
the
home
even
though
they
are
committing
crimes.
i
think
the
framers
in
effect
weighed
that,
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
man
has
a
right
to
retreat
into
his
own
home
and
there
be
free
from
unreasonable
governmental
intrusion.
unfortunately
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
cases
that
get
to
this
court
always
seem
to
deal
with
criminals.
[laughter]
but
it
seems
to
me
i
would
not
like
it
if
the
police
using
their
own
discretion
came
into
my
apartment
in
new
york
and
stayed
19
hours
because
they
believed
i
had
contraband
and
then
continued
to
search
and
not
search
depending
on
what
a
magistrate
does
the
next
day.
that
would
affect
my
rights
as
not
a
criminal.
the
difference
between
seizing
from
the
outside
and
securing
from
the
outside
and
doing
what
the
police
did
here
is
not
a
difference
in
result.
the
result
would
have
been
the
same,
the
securing
of
the
evidence,
but
i
think
on
the
outside
would
have
been
reasonable.
i
would
equate
the
going
inside
rather
than
securing
it
from
the
outside
as
opening
the
trunk
in
chadwick
before
they
got
the
warrant
or
opening
the
suitcase
in
arkansas
v.
sanders
before
they
got
the
warrant.
even
though
the
house
might
be
considered
seized
even
from
the
outside
that
would
be
perhaps
a
reasonable
seizure.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
would
still
argue
it,
but
i
think
my
argument
would
carry
less
weight
because
in
that
situation
there
would
at
least
be
a
break
in
the
continuous
seizure.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
would
argue
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
i
would--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--only
in
the
respect
that--
mr.
peter
j.
fabricant
--no,
right.
