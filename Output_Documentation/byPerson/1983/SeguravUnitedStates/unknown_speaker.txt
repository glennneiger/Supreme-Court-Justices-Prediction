unknown
speaker
where
did
all
of
this
take
place?
on
long
island?
unknown
speaker
only
one
magistrate
up
there?
unknown
speaker
what
day
of
the
week
was
february
12?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
had
the
magistrate
known
of
the
18
or
19
hour
occupancy
of
the
home
that
his
action
would
have
been
any
different?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
i
suppose
you
would
concede
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
on
the
afternoon
that
you
described
where
the
police
saw
the
delivery
of
this
parcel
to
the
two
other
people.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
was
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
fabricant,
there
is
certainly
some
of
our
cases
dealing
with
say
a
suitcase
or
whatever
it
was
in
arkansas
v.
sanders
and
the
footlocker
in
chadwick
that
say
even
though
the
police
may
not
inspect
a
container
without
a
warrant
they
can
detain
it
while
they
are
getting
a
warrant.
now
why
is
this
case
any
different
from
those?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fabricant,
in
your
view
could
the
police
have
secured
the
house
from
the
outside
for
19
hours
while
they
got
the
warrant
not
letting
anybody
in
or
out?
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
view
would
have
been
acceptable.
how
about
if
the
police
had
made
the
illegal
entry
into
the
house
but
then
had
withdrawn
immediately
thereafter
and
then
19
hours
later
gotten
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
well,
valid
or
invalid?
unknown
speaker
the
subsequent
warrant
in
your
view.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
initial
entry
then
had
been
on
exigent
circumstances
and
valid,
let's
say,
in
hot
pursuit
of
someone
or
something
and
then
19
hours
expired
before
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
inside,
but
a
legal
entry.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the
subsequent
warrant
valid?
unknown
speaker
at
the
time
of
the
entry
and/or
shortly
thereafter
do
you
think
the
officers
could
have
taken
the
parcels
and
removed
them
from
the
apartment
and
secured
them
and
then
left
the
apartment
and
then
ultimately
opened
them
at
the
time
they
got
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory
when
the
police
are
outside
would
they
prevent
people
from
going
in?
unknown
speaker
on
what
ground?
unknown
speaker
on
what
ground?
unknown
speaker
i
am
having
great
difficulty
with
what
is
the
difference.
they
stay
in
there
that
means
you
cannot
come
in
or
go
out.
unknown
speaker
if
they
are
outside
you
cannot
come
in
or
go
out.
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
was
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
difference
i
submit
by
people
moving
in
and
out
because
moving
in
and
out
can
carry
in
and
out.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
difference.
well,
don't
you
have
to
say
that
the
warrant
is
the
product
of
the
illegal
entry?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
that
was
admitted
was
the
materials
that
were
found
after
the
warrant
was
issued.
unknown
speaker
the
warrant
rested
on
independent
grounds
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
it
indicate...
suppose
there
had
never
been
any
warrant
issued
and
no
search
under
a
warrant.
the
officers
just
went
into
the
apartment
illegally
and
seized
what
they
saw
in
plain
sight
and
then
left.
that
would
be
held
inadmissible--
unknown
speaker
--just
like
it
was
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
so
why
isn't
that
a
sufficient
remedy
for
the
illegal
entry
just
render
inadmissible
what
they
seized
prior
to
the
warrant?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
it
is
a
product
because
if
they
had
not
been
there
the
evidence
might
have
been
destroyed
or
it
might
have
gone
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
only
way
you
think
the
occupation
of
that
house
taints
the
later
seizure?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
nobody
is
allowing
it.
unknown
speaker
nobody
is
allowing
it.
unknown
speaker
the
court
here
held
it
was
an
illegal
entry.
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
your
argument
to
be
understood,
counsel,
as
meaning
that
the
government
may
never
gain
any
advantage
out
of
an
illegal
entry?
unknown
speaker
into
a
home
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
intended
to
put
it
on
the
first
part
of
the
question
that
the
government
may
never
profit
or
secure
any
advantage
toward
a
prosecution
if
it
flows
from
an
illegal
entry
of
a
home.
unknown
speaker
the
advantage
that
was
secured
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
seizures
made
after
the
warrant
was
issued
was
just
that
the
evidence
was
still
there
and
it
might
not
have
been
if
they
had
not
been
in
the
home.
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
advantage
then
did
the
government
get
by
the
illegal
entry?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
police
could
have
got
a
warrant
on
the
information
they
had
before
they
entered
the
home?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
was
an
opportunity
and
there
may
always
be
time.
was
the
information
which
the
police
had
if
it
had
been
presented
to
a
magistrate
on
other
judicial
officer
sufficient
to
get
a
valid
warrant?
you
concede
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
some
things
that
they
did
not
know
19
hours
before.
unknown
speaker
they
were
taking
some
risk
i
suppose
that
a
warrant
might
not
have
issued.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
never
know
in
advance
whether
a
warrant
is
going
to
issue
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
all
pretty
well
settled.
no
one
as
i
understand
it
is
arguing
that
the
entry
into
the
home
was
legal
or
was
justified
without
a
warrant.
the
question
is
what
consequences
should
be
attached
to
the
illegal
entry.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
evidence
they
found
pursuant
to
their
illegal
entry
was
suppressed.
unknown
speaker
sure.
isn't
that
a
sufficient
deterrent
to
unlawful
conduct
because
if
an
officer
enters
a
home
illegally
and
discovers
something
it
cannot
be
used?
isn't
that
enough
of
a
deterrent
without
also
arguing
that
evidence
obtained
under
the
warrant
which
was
not
obtained
by
virtue
of
any
illegal
discovery
should
also
be
invalidated?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
government
to
argue
that
the
entry
was
actually
legal?
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
can
stay
on
the
premises
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
you
should
be
able
to
enter
the...
if
you
stay
on
the
premises
legally
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
enter
the
premises
legally
in
the
first
place
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
logical
end
of
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
do
not
agree,
but
if
you
lose
this
case
wouldn't
that
be
the
necessary
result
that
the
entry
is
legal
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
how
can
that--
--the
consequence
that
justice
white
just
suggested
to
you,
though,
is
essentially
the
same,
is
it
not,
if
there
had
been
a
hot
pursuit
and
the
peopled
entered
the
house
and
the
police
followed
them
in
the
hot
pursuit
context.
no
warrant
there
is
there?
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
is
no
exception
as
of
now
at
least
that
allows
the
police
to
occupy
a
premises
to
preserve
the
status
quo
with
respect
to
evidence.
unknown
speaker
counsel.
unknown
speaker
you
emphasize
the
19
hours.
suppose
it
had
been
half
an
hour.
unknown
speaker
would
it
have
changed
the
outcome
of
the
case
in
your
opinion?
unknown
speaker
at
the
level
you
are
arguing
here
today.
you
have
emphasized
19
hours.
of
course,
that
is
more
egregious,
but
in
terms
of
the
principle
involved
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
half
hour
or
15
minutes
or
19
hours?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
your
position
would
have
to
be
though
that
entry
for
five
minutes
is
illegal.
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
here
if
it
were
only
five
minutes
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
only
five
minutes
you
would
still
be
here
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
might
not
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
would
change
the
fourth
amendment
rationale
very
much.
i
mean
whether
the
entry
was
legal.
unknown
speaker
it
is
either
legal
or
it
is
illegal
in
both
instances
whether
it
is
nine
hours
or
five
minutes.
unknown
speaker
you
confess
a
place
of
business
is
distinguished
from
a
residence,
a
home.
unknown
speaker
the
connection
according
to
the
other
side
is
that
they
stayed
there.
i
think
his
argument
would
be
if
they
had
gone
out
and
left
the
place
and
then
gone
19
hours
for
the
warrant
they
would
not
have
the
same
complaint.
but
somehow
they
say
the
fact
that
they
stayed
there
in
the
house
for
19
hours
negated
the
whole
thing.
incidentally,
did
they
get
overtime
for
that
19
hours?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
under
your
rule
what
is
the
incentive
for
them
to
leave?
unknown
speaker
it
is
desirable
as
you
conceded
it
that
they
should
not
stay.
now
what
is
their
incentive
to
get
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
seizing
a
home
from
the
inside
without
a
warrant
and
seizing
it
from
the
outside?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
ordinarily
seize
real
property
do
you?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
could
do
it
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
seizure
involved
if
you
secured
it
from
the
outside.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
labeled
seizure?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
just
use
the
term
"seizure".
it
uses
the
term
"unreasonable
seizure".
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
one
could
say
that
the
seizure
when
you
are
outside
is
reasonable
but
when
you
are
inside
it
is
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
at
least
that
is
conceptually
possible
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
have
almost
admitted
it
because
you
said
you
thought
they
ought
to
go
outside.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
you
thought
they
ought
to
get
out
as
soon
they
could
and
why
unless
you
think
one
condition
is
more
reasonable
than
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
they
have
an
incentive
to
stay
in
in
february
in
new
york.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
not
bet
on
it.
[laughter]
mr.
frey,
i
take
it
although
the
issue
is
not
here
but
i
take
it
from
your
brief
or
somewhere
that
if
the
officers
had
known
in
advance
what
they
learned
after
they
entered
here
as
to
who
was
on
the
premises
you
would
say
that
they
could
have
entered
legally.
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
known
that
there
were
people
on
the
premises
and
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
are
easily
disposable
narcotics
on
the
premises,
could
they
make
a
legal
entry
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
people?
unknown
speaker
in
which
event
although
the
entry
was
legal
if
they
stayed
too
long
it
would
become
illegal.
unknown
speaker
the
affidavit
as
i
understand
it
was
not
only
based
on
facts
that
were
in
the
hands
of
the
police
before
the
entry
but
was
actually
turned
in
earlier
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
was
the
affidavit
turned
in
later?
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
executed?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
also
have
a
problem
that
you
really
have
not
met
yet
of
saying
that
the
illegal
entry
tainted
the
later
search
under
the
warrant
because
it
did
keep
the
people
who
were
found
to
be
on
the
premises
from
destroying
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
you
still
have
to
get
to
that.
unknown
speaker
what
about
removing
it?
is
that
illegal
too?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
would
have
been
a
crime
for
somebody
to
pick
up
the
briefcase
and
walk
off
and
go
to
somebody
else's
house
with
it?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know.
unknown
speaker
did
they
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
anybody
they
found
in
there
that
came
out
of
the
building?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
could
have
searched
anybody
who
came
out
of
the
apartment?
they
might
not
have
been
able
to
detain
them.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
a
case...
there
are
so
many
fourth
amendment
cases.
do
we
have
a
case
that
says
that
officers
may
secure
a
house
until
they
get
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
we
applied
it
at
least
if
not
stated
it
in
the
search
case
last
june,
the
name
of
which
eludes
me
now
other
than
mincey
where
the
customs
agents
found
and
then
they
had
a
controlled
delivery.
is
that
mincey?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
another
problem
here?
wouldn't
your
result
possibly
depend
on
the
length
of
time
involved
and
how
your
opponent
in
effect
says
you
take
the
same
position
with
five
minutes
and
19
hours?
i
take
it
you
might
not
take
the
same
position
if
it
was
30
days
say
because
even
though
it
might
not
be
deliberately
destroyed
just
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
a
cleaning
person
might
come
in
and
throw
something
away.
conditions
change
over
a
long
period
of
time.
maybe
i
should
ask
you.
would
you
take
the
same
position
in
30
days?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
was
a
home
out
in
the
country
somewhere
and
they
just
moved
in
for
30
days
just
waiting
and
for
some
reason
there
was--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
don't
think
that
would
have
any
impact
at
all
on
this
issue
no
matter
how
long
a
period
of
time
involved?
unknown
speaker
well,
30
days
would
be
"unreasonable"
wouldn't
you
say?
unknown
speaker
because
i
mean,
for
example,
if
the
agents
stayed
in
that
apartment
for
30
days
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
amount
of
food.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
they
were
both
arrested.
unknown
speaker
you
went
a
little
too
fast
for
me
to
catch
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
red
briefcase
that
was
put
in
locker
16
contains
narcotics
or
some
such
thing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
frey,
would
your
hypothetical
produce
the
same
answer
if
the
telephone
call
from
the
informant
was
after
the
owner
of
the
briefcase
went
to
the
check
room
and
said
i
want
my
briefcase?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
this
case
if
they
could
prove
that
ten
hours
later
the
cleaning
woman
would
have
come
and
cleaned
out
the
apartment,
not
to
destroy
evidence
but
she
does
not
like
these
little
bags
around
or
something
like
that.
then
they
would
win.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
if,
however,
she
had
a
key
to
the
back
door
or
something
like
that
then
you
would
lose.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
what
all
this
trouble
is
about.
i
never
heard
any
cleaning
women
around
these
shooting
galleries.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
cleaning
people
involved
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
recall
from
the
findings
of
the
district
court
or
the
district
court's
observations
but
was
there
any
treatment
of
whether
this
was
a
place
of
business
or
home
or
residence
by
the
district
judge?
unknown
speaker
treated
it,
but
was
there
any
analysis
directed?
unknown
speaker
the
same
degree?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
it
was
unlawful
is
that
they
actually
were
mistaken
about
exigent
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
brought
that
up.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
challenged
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
not
defending
the
result
below
on
the
grounds
that
the
entry
in
the
first
place
was
legal?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
it
were
a
place
of
business?
unknown
speaker
then
what
about--
unknown
speaker
--then
what
about
a
home
which
is
used
as
a
place
of
business
with
the
home
if
it
could
be
shown
merely
a
front,
a
cover
and
it
is
really
a
place
for
distributing
narcotics?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
expectation,
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
conduct
of
criminal
affairs,
criminal
activity?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
spoke
of
it
in
terms
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
the
way
the
courts
have
spoken
of
it.
it
is
the
subjective
feeling
of
the
occupant
of
the
home
that
he
or
she
or
all
of
them
are
going
to
be
secure.
what
i
am
trying
to
get
from
you
is
you
seem
to
concede
that
there
is
less
an
expectation,
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
if
it
is
a
place
of
business.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
officers
stayed
19
hours
and
then
left
and
the
next
day
a
warrant
was
issued
on
independent
grounds,
on
grounds
that
were
not
tainted
and
they
went
and
discovered
what
they
discovered
here.
would
you
still
argue
that
the
officers
had
committed
such
a
grossly
illegal
act
that
the
authorities
should
never
be
able
to
search
the
house?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
in
terms
of
the
connection
between
the
entry
and
the
discovery
under
the
warrant--
unknown
speaker
--i
know,
but
you
would
have
to.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
argument
is
any
weaker
or
any
stronger
now
than
if
it
were
the
next
day?
do
you
think
the
break
makes
any
reason?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
you
would
have
to
lose
the
case
if
it
were
the
next
day.
wouldn't
you
think
you
should
lose
this
one?
no,
right.
