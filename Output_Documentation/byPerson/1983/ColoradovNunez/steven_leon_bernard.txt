mr.
steven
leon
bernard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
the
7th
day
of
november
of
1981,
denver
detective
sergeant
don
denovellis
obtained
information
from
a
confidential
informant.
the
informant
told
detective
denovellis
that
a
person
known
as
antonio
guadalupe
nunez
had
been
seen
by
the
informant
within
the
last
24
hours
preparing
heroin
for
sale.
he
was
diluting
the
heroin
and
putting
it
into
balloons,
a
common
mode
of
packaging
for
sale.
the
informant
told
detective
denovellis
that
mr.
nunez
said
that
he
had
recently
been
to
mexico
and
in
mexico
he
had
purchased
five
ounces
of
heroin.
detective
denovellis
then
obtained
a
search
warrant
based
upon
this
information
and,
along
with
adams
county
sheriff's
officers,
went
to
mr.
nunez's
home
in
adams
county,
colorado.
they
entered
the
home
and
searched
mr.
nunez
and
from
his
pocket
they
took
15
balloons
which
contained
heroin.
mr.
nunez
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
schedule
one
controlled
substance
in
colorado
and
his
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
fruits
of
that
search,
alleging
in
part
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
that
search.
he
also
filed
a
motion
for
the
disclosure
of
this
particular
confidential
informant
who
provided
this
information.
a
hearing
was
held
in
september
of
1982
upon
that
motion
for
disclosure.
at
that
time,
mr.
nunez
himself
testified.
he
stated
among
other
things
that
he
was
off
in
the
mountains
hunting
in
his
motor
home,
that
he
had
to
been
to
mexico,
and
that
the
only
people
who
had
been
at
his
home
within
24
hours
of
the
7th
day
of
november
of
1981
were
members
of
his
immediate
and
extended
family.
he
also
said
at
one
point
during
cross
examination
that
he
did
not
know
what
heroin
was.
the
court,
based
upon
this
information,
ordered
the
prosecution
to
disclose
the
name
of
the
informant.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
i
certainly
do,
justice
o'connor,
and
for
the
following
reasons:
the
court
in
the
case
of
colorado
versus
nunez
relied
upon
three
prior
colorado
decisions.
the
first
decision
was
people
versus
dailey
which
had
been
decided
approximately
one
and
a
half
years
before.
in
people
versus
dailey,
the
colorado
supreme
court
referred
at
one
point
to
the
colorado
constitution,
but
at
that
time
it
was
only
for
the
amount
of
information
necessary
to
begin
a
veracity
hearing.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say
so,
but
i
don't
believe
that
i
can,
because
there
is
an
indication--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--there
is
an
indication
clearly
that
it
was
based
upon
the
colorado
constitution.
but,
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
disclosure
of
the
informant.
the
colorado
court
in
dailey--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes.
justice
lohr
said
exactly
that.
they
have
adopted
the
same
test
of
roviaro
versus
mccray.
if
i
may
elaborate
on
my
answer
a
little
bit,
in
the
dailey
opinion,
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
specifically
that
while
the
colorado
constitution
may
support
a
lesser
amount
of
evidence
shown,
when
it
talked
about
what
consequences,
and
disclosure
is
one
of
the
consequences,
that
must
flow
from
the
decision
the
court
must
make
after
that
showing,
it
referred
specifically
to
both
the
united
states
constitution
and
to
the
colorado
constitution.
at
that
hearing...
after
that
hearing
and
after
the
order
of
disclosure,
the
prosecution
took
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
colorado
in
which
that
issue
was
addressed.
the
colorado
supreme
court
affirmed
the
lower
court's
decision
and
we
petitioned
for
certiorari.
this
court
granted
review.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
essentially
twofold.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
that
is
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
we
were
concerned
for
the
informant's
safety.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
an
issue
that
was
reserved
in
franks
versus
delaware.
in
that
opinion
at
page
170,
justice
blackmun
reserved
the
issue,
a
difficult
issue,
of
whether
an
informant
should
be
disclosed
after
a
satisfactory
showing
at
a
veracity
hearing.
the
issue
in
this
case
also
concerns
where,
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
if
the
counsel
for
the
accused
and
the
court
both
concede
that
the
credibility
of
the
police
officer
of
frank
is
not
at
issue,
therefore,
should
there
be
disclosure
at
all?
before
we
get--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
goes
to
a
question
of
fourth
amendment
interpretation
and
the
exclusionary
rule.
first
of
all,
beginning
with
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
with
this
court's
recent
decision
in
illinois
versus
gates,
there
is
clearly
an
issue
of
whether
a
confidential
informant
can
be
used
in
a
search
warrant.
when
that
happens,
that
becomes
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
this
is
not
merely
a
question
of
evidentiary
law,
but
this
is
a
question
of
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
question
is,
therefore,
does
the
fourth
amendment
require
disclosure
if,
after
a
veracity
hearing,
there
is
a
certain
showing.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes.
we
submit
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
that.
and,
we
submit,
even
assuming
in
certain
situations
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
permit
disclosure
of
an
informant's
name
after
an
appropriate
showing
at
a
veracity
hearing
in
our
case,
that
should
not
be
because
the
whole
purpose
of
a
veracity
hearing
is
to
question
whether
the
state
itself
has
erred
in
any
way,
whether
there
has
been
police
misconduct,
if
the
affiant's
credibility
is
not
at
issue.
in
other
words,
if
the
affiant
in
good
faith
relied
upon
what
he
was
told
by
his
informant,
then
there
is
no
purpose,
no
application,
no
deterrant
result
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
well,
justice
marshall,
first
of
all,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
purpose
of
using
confidential
informants
is
to
hide
the
truth.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
what
their
use
is
in
the
past.
the
issue
at
a
veracity
hearing--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--first,
the
defense
counsel
could
strenuously
cross
examine
the
affiant
himself.
the
affiant
was
present
in--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--pardon
me?
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
the
affiant?
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
i
would
hope
that
the
officer--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--yes,
sir.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
there
is--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--there
are
alternative
forms
of
information.
for
example,
as
in
this
case,
information
from
the
accused
himself,
information
from
other
people
whom
the
accused
may
bring
into
the
court
who
have
information
to
give
to
the
court
on
this
issue.
hypothetically,
if
the
assertion
had
been
that
i
had
not
been
at
my
home
when
that
person
said
i
was
there,
and
the
defendant
could
bring
in
people
who
could
say,
yes,
he
was
not
at
his
home,
he
was
with
me.
that
would
be
an
alternative
form
of
establishing
that
information.
so,
i
submit
there
are
at
least
two
alternatives.
one
is
questioning
the
affiant
and
one
is
permitting
the
defense
himself
to
bring
in
information
to
attack
the
credibility
of
the
affiant.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
an
in
camera
hearing--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--no.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
no.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
because
an
in
camera
hearing,
we
feel,
has
certain
threats.
one
threat
is
this.
if
an
informant
knows
that
he
is
going
to
be
brought
before
a
court,
even
in
camera
without
defense
counsel
present,
he
may
not
provide
the
police
the
information
that
is
necessary
to
either
solve
a
crime
or
to--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--justice
marshall,
i
submit
that
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
an
informant
may
lie
and
i
think
that
is
undeniable.
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
a
police
officer
may
lie.
but,
i
don't
think
that
the
presumption
is
either
that
police
officers
or
informants
lie.
i
think
that
the
privilege
itself
was
established
to
permit
a
flow
of
information.
and,
i
think
in
mccray
versus
illinois
justice
weintraub
foresaw
exactly
the
problem
that
we
see
in
this
case.
in
the
quote
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
justice
weintraub
says
that
if
a
defendant
knows
that
he
can
submit
to
the
court
any
evidence
at
all,
the
court
itself
is
going
to
order
disclosure
because
they
have
no
ability
to
impeach.
at
that
point,
the
informant
will
always
be
disclosed
and
the
whole
chain
of
information
will
be
broken,
the
flow
of
information
will
be
dried
up.
if
at
a
veracity
hearing
the
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
accused
has
committed
a
crime
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
at
his
residence
are
the
fruits
of
that
crime,
then
in
this
case
the
disclosure
of
the
informant
is
an
ancillary
part
of
that.
it
is
part
of
the
probable
cause
determination.
since
aguilar
and
spinelli
and
gates
made
rules
under
our
constitution
to
govern
the
use
of
confidential
informants
and
warrants
the
decision
whether
to
disclose
them
becomes
a
fourth
amendment
consideration
here.
as
i
said
to
justice
o'connor
earlier,
it
is
not
a
question
of
evidentiary
law,
state
evidentiary
law,
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
franks
versus
delaware
analysis
and
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
issue
that
this
court
reserved
in
that
case.
there
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
an
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds
for
this
decision
which
justice
o'connor
raised.
the
tests
that
this
court
has
established
in
a
series
of
cases,
delaware
versus
prouse,
south
dakota
versus
neville,
culminating
with
michigan
versus
long,
which
was
decided
in
july
of
1983,
i
believe,
indicates
that
this
court
presumes
that
there
is
not
an
independent
and
adequate
state
grounds
if
there
is
not
a
clear
and
express
showing
on
the
face
of
the
opinion.
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
issue
of
disclosure
is
concerned,
there
was
no
clear
and
independent
showing
of
state
law.
as
far
as
any
remedy
to
be
derived
from
a
veracity
hearing,
there
was
no
clear
and
independent
showing
of
state
law.
based
upon
that
presumption,
i
submit
that
this
court
does
and
should
take
jurisdiction.
in
the
colorado
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
nunez
case...
it
referred,
as
i
said
earlier,
to
three
cases...
the
case
of
dailey,
the
case
of
martinez,
and
the
case
of
bueno.
in
dailey,
when
the
court
talked
about
disclosure,
it
referred
to
two
things.
first,
franks
versus
delaware,
which
was
a
case
decided
by
this
court
on
fourth
amendment
grounds,
and
then
the
court
talked
about
solely
in
dailey
if
there
is
the
affiant's
perjury
or
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth,
the
colorado
court
discussed
that
remedy
in
terms
of
dailey...
excuse
me,
in
terms
of
franks
only.
in
other
words,
in
terms
only
of
the
colorado
constitution.
in
fact--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--excuse
me,
in
the
united
states
constitution.
i
apologize,
justice
white.
my
mistake.
in
fact,
that
court
said
that
the
test
for
disclosure
is
the
same
as
this
court
established
in
roviaro
and
in
mccray
versus
illinois.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
justice
stevens,
that
is
always
a
possibility.
the
colorado
supreme
court
could
say
this
was
a
decision
that
should
have
been
decided
on
colorado
state
law,
refer
to
the
colorado
constitution
and
decided
that
way.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
i
would
submit
that
if
this
court
reversed,
the
colorado
supreme
court
would
be
bound
by
this
court's
opinion.
if,
in
a
later
case,
the
colorado
supreme
court
wished
to
adopt
the
colorado
constitution,
then
it
could
do
so.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
well,
i
believe--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--i
believe
so,
especially
since
it
referred
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and,
since
this
court
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
that
constitution,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
say
that.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
i
would
submit
that
they
have.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
certainly.
this
court
can
decide
the
federal
issue
present
in
this
case.
if
it
does
so,
then
the
court
must
say
that
since
the
colorado
supreme
court
referred
to
the
consequences
under
the
united
states
constitution,
the
colorado
supreme
court
cannot
take
the
united
states
constitution
and
do
what
it
wanted
to
do
in
this
case.
if
the
colorado
supreme
court
wishes
to
rely
on
the
state
constitution,
i
concur
it
is
the
ultimate
arbiter
of
that
constitution.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
submit
that
that
certainly
is
a
possibility,
however,
if,
in
fact,
that
were
the
case,
i
am
not
cognizant
of
the
subsequent
decisions
in
michigan
versus
long
at
the
state
level
and
south
dakota
versus
neville
at
the
state
level.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
well,
justice
rehnquist,
i
guess
what
my
position
is
is
this;
that
this
court
can
tell
the
colorado
constitution
it
can't
do
what
it
did
under
the
united
states
constitution.
if
it
wishes
to
do
that
under
the
colorado
constitution,
i
suppose
they
can
do
so.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes.
and,
i
know
california
has
done
that
too.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
well,
ultimately
i
think
that
that
is
probably
an
appropriate
resolution
anyway.
if
a
court
does
decide
that
it
is
going
to
rely
on
state
law...
i
think
michigan
versus
long
says
if
it
is
going
to
do
that
it
should
make
it
very
clear
and
that
has
not
been
done
in
this
case.
ultimately,
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
violation
if
an
affiant
in
good
faith--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--yes,
by
the
colorado
court
it
was.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
at
the
time
the
colorado
case
was
decided,
there
was
in
existence
the
following
cases:
delaware
versus
prouse,
south
dakota
versus
neville,
and
those
cases
indicated
that
there
is
an
appropriate
basis
for
this
court
taking
jurisdiction.
there
may
be
an
independent
ground,
but
it
is
not
adequate
and
that
was
the
prior
test.
in
fact,
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
in
the
jurisdiction
statement
at
pages
1
through
9,
we
did
argue
those
cases
and
not
michigan
versus
long.
i
think
even
under
those
tests
there
is
an
appropriate
basis
for
this
court
to
take
jurisdiction
and
there
is
not
independent
adequate
state
grounds.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
well--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--your
honor,
i
am--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--that
is
not
the
issue
here
obviously.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
it
has
jurisdiction.
and,
we
have
not
briefed
whether
michigan
versus
long
is
retroactive
nor
whether--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--i
would
prefer
to
have
it
because
i
think
it
is
clearer.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes,
i
do.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
the
exclusionary
rule
which
was
applied
in
this
case,
because
the
evidence
was
suppressed
when
the
state
refused
to
disclose
its
informant,
balances
two
social
issues.
first
of
all,
the
deterrent
of
police
misconduct
against
convicting
guilty
people.
there
is
no
deterrence
by
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
if
there
is
no
police
misconduct.
therefore,
if
there
is
no
deterrent
effect,
there
is
no
need
to
let
the
guilty
go
free.
the
purpose
of
a
veracity
hearing,
therefore,
has
to
be
determine
if
the
affiant,
not
the
informant,
has
engaged
in
misconduct.
there
will
be,
i
would
submit,
an
effect
on
law
enforcement
in
revealing
the
names
of
confidential
informants
on
a
regular
basis.
that
will
dry
up
sources
of
information
which
lead
to
the
solving
of
crimes
and
dry
up
sources
of
information
that
lead
to
the
apprehension
of
criminals.
it
is
a
sad
but
true
fact
that
some
people
will
not
come
forward
and
cooperate
with
the
police
unless
they
are
assured
of
anonymity.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
it
is,
your
honor.
and,
that
sadly
has
been
something
that
has
happened
in
the
past.
as
we
indicated
before,
we
say
that
there
is
no
need
as
a
matter
of
law
ever
to
reveal
an
informant's
name
and
i
discussed
with
justice
marshall
the
alternatives
to
disclosure
of
that
informant.
however,
even
if
an
informant
should
be
revealed
in
some
circumstances,
he
should
not
be
revealed
here.
it
was
only
private
action
in
this
case,
although
there
has
been
some
indication
by
the
respondent
that
the
respondent
didn't
mean
to
say
that
he
did
not
question
the
affiant's
credibility,
nonetheless,
the
record
contains
four
separate
references
to
the
fact
that
he
was
concerned
with
the
informant,
not
the
affiant's
credibility.
secondly,
disclosure
does
not
serve
in
this
case,
because
there
was
no
police
misconduct,
the
fourth
amendment,
or
the
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
even
people
who
are
involved
at
the
fringes
of
the
warrant
process
are
going
to
be
affected
by
the
fact
that
they
will
not
be
assured
of
anonymity.
we
ask
this
court
to
at
least,
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
indicate
to
the
state
of
colorado
that
the
disclosure
of
informants
should
not
occur
at
veracity
hearings,
and
even
if
this
court
feels
that
disclosure
is
in
some
cases
appropriate,
we
ask
this
court
to
indicate
that
the
disclosure
of
the
informant
in
this
case
was
inappropriate
because
there
was
no
indication,
no
allegation,
and
no
proof
that
the
affiant
lied
or
recklessly
disregarded
the
truth.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
just
one,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
one
point.
the
issue
on
disclosure
was
argued
below
and
the
record
will
bear
that
out.
but,
i
think
that
there
is
some
confusion
here
between
what
mr.
stern
says
and
what
i
say.
mr.
stern
suggests
that
this
is
merely
a
discovery
issue.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
discovery
issue.
the
issue
here
is
the
use
of
disclosure
in
a
veracity
hearing
which
triggers
constitutional
issues
of
probable
cause
and
police
misconduct.
it
is
not
a
question
of
disclosure
for
trial
at
which
an
accused
may
want
to
have
someone
who
witnessed
the
crime
present
to
testify.
but,
it
is
an
issue
of
the
warrant
process
and
the
warrant
process
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
court's
determination.
in
dailey,
the
case
upon
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
relied,
when
that
court
discussed
disclosure
it
referred
to
the
fourth
amendment,
to
franks
versus
delaware,
to
the
sanctions
that
should
fall
under
franks
versus
delaware,
and
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
in
no
place
did
it
refer
to
any
bit
of
colorado
constitution.
it
talked
about
mccray,
it
talked
about
roviaro,
it
talked
about
franks.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
no,
however--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--roviaro
talks
about
the
privilege
in
a
general
sense.
in
roviaro...
that
was
not
in
this
context.
it
was
a
situation
where
the
accused
saw
the
crime,
the
act
upon
which
the
charge
was
based,
and
that
was
the
focus
of
this
court's
concern
in
roviaro.
it
was
a
due
process
concern.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
i
don't
think
it
is
that
clear,
your
honor.
i
submit--
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
--well,
there
was
also
the
reference
to
franks
versus
delaware
which
is
obviously
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
steven
leon
bernard
yes,
they
did.
and,
the
issue
as
far
as
roviaro
was
concerned
is
that
in
roviaro
the
court
was
talking
about
the
existence
of
an
informer
privilege.
in
mccray,
it
talked
about
the
disclosure
of
informants
when
the
issue
was
not
whether
the
informant
perceived
the
crime
on
which
the
charge
was
based.
and,
finally
we
have
now
the
melding
of
mccray
and
franks
presented
in
this
case.
