unknown
speaker
mr.
bernard,
do
you
think
that
the
colorado
court
based
its
holding
on
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
point,
i
think
dailey
states
that
in
colorado
the
rule
is
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
veracity
hearing
once
he
shows
a
good
faith
basis
for
believing
the
material
in
the
affidavit
was
inaccurate.
now,
do
you
think
that
that
holding
is
based
on
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
it
is
not.
unknown
speaker
the
roviaro-mccray
issue?
unknown
speaker
on
that
you
think
the
colorado
law
is
the
same
as
or
based
on
federal
law
on
that
aspect
of
the
question?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
in
colorado
is
it
true
that
you
could
have
had
an
in
camera
hearing
on
this
point?
unknown
speaker
and,
you
didn't
ask
for
it?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
in
an
in
camera?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
federal
constitution
imposes
some
limits
on
how
liberal
a
state's
rule
of
evidence
can
be
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
the
disclosure
of
an
informant's
name?
unknown
speaker
how
will
you
get
to
the
veracity
if
you
don't
admit
who
the
person
is,
if
you
don't
have
an
in
camera
investigation?
you
use
the
word
"veracity".
that
means
truth,
doesn't
it?
how
do
you
get
to
the
truth
if
you
hide
the
truth?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
remedy
does
the
defense
counsel
have
if
the
government
says
we
have
this
information,
but
we
won't
tell
you
where
we
got
it
from?
unknown
speaker
whom
i
assume
also
is
very
capable.
unknown
speaker
he
is
very
capable.
he
is
not
a
run-of-the-mill
person.
unknown
speaker
the
officer,
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
is
a
well
trained
person?
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
can't
break
him
down,
then
you
lose.
unknown
speaker
what
else
can
you
do?
unknown
speaker
but,
why
can't
you
have
the
in
camera
hearing?
unknown
speaker
is
there
somebody
in
there
that
you
don't
trust?
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
say
so,
i
will
ask
you
to
name
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
you
have
an
in
camera
hearing?
unknown
speaker
if
i
assume
that
correct
and
i
also
assume
that
on
the
same
facts
an
informant
would
not
hesitate
to
lie
because
nothing
could
be
done
about
it.
unknown
speaker
of
what
constitution?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
question
about
the
disposition
of
the
case?
your
brief
ends
by
saying
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
do
you
mean
by
that
to
say
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
could
not
reinstated
its
prior
judgment
and
explain
that
it
really
did
mean
to
base
it
on
colorado
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
outcome
of
the
case
conceivably...
we
don't
say
it
would...
but
conceivably
be
exactly
the
same
no
matter
what
we
do.
unknown
speaker
but,
do
you
think
we
can
tell
them
they
must
hold
a
veracity
hearing?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
they
must
direct
the
lower
court
to
hold
a
veracity
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
lost
their
authority
to
reach
the
same
conclusion
based
on
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
bernard,
that
is
quite
a
remarkable
conclusion,
i
think,
that
you
reach
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
that...
i
can
see
how
we
could
say
in
correct
case
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
require
the
sort
of
rule
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
thought
it
required,
but
you
are
saying
that
even
though
the
colorado
supreme
court
wished
to
base
its
ruling
on
state
law,
the
fourth
amendment
prevents
it
from
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
could
you
spell
out
exactly
how
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
you
do
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question?
unknown
speaker
yes.
and,
in
any
mandate
that
comes
down
from
this
court
to
a
state
court
reversing
the
state
court
opinion
says
the
judgment
is
reversed
and
the
cause
or
matter
for
further
proceedings
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
wouldn't
such
a
proceeding
be
a
hearing
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
in
which
it
said,
well,
we
also
relied
on
our
state
constitution
or,
although
we
didn't
before,
we
now
rely
on
our
state
constitution
to
reach
the
result
we
did?
unknown
speaker
that
wouldn't
take
our
jurisdiction
away
to
hear
the
case,
but
i
think
that
that
would
mean
that
your
answer
to
justice
steven's
question
perhaps
ought
to
be
reconsidered.
unknown
speaker
haven't
several
state
supreme
courts
done
that
after
we
have
reversed
on
the
federal
ground
here?
unknown
speaker
the
opperman
case,
i
think,
south
dakota.
unknown
speaker
several
of
them
have
done
that.
that
might
lead
some
people
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
should
not
have
been
so
ambiguous
about
the
basis
of
its
holding.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
case
was
decided
before
we
decided
michigan
and
long,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
we
ever
say
before
michigan
and
long
that
the
state
supreme
court
had
to
say
clearly
when
it
relied
on
the--
unknown
speaker
--but,
you
do
contend,
don't
you,
that
michigan
against
long
announced
a
new
rule
of
law?
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
rule
is
retroactive?
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
is
the
issue
in
the
case,
whether
michigan
against
long
is
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
jurisdictional
issue
i
might
suggest.
unknown
speaker
are
you
content
to
have
us
decide
the
jurisdictional
issue
without
reference
to
michigan
against
long?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
is
a
little
helpful
to
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
sometimes
it
is
bad
for
their
health,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
veracity
hearing
as
you
call
it
out
there?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let's
put
that
in
concrete
terms.
what
did
the
affiant
say
about
the
informant?
what
did
he
say
that
is
going
to
be
tested
in
this
hearing?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
doesn't
tell
me
much
in
concrete
terms.
what
is
it
said
that
the
informant
informed
to
the
police
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
was
the
conduct?
unknown
speaker
and,
what
happened
when
they
made
the
search?
unknown
speaker
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth?
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
see.
i
am
not
sure
i
track
you.
you
say
the
informant
told
the
police
that
on
a
given
day
he
was
in
the
home
of
nunez
and
that
he
saw
him
engaged
in
handle
dope,
packaging
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
gave
that
information
to
the
police?
unknown
speaker
and,
they
put
that
in
whatever
form
is
required
in
colorado
law
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
the
house,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
police
took
that
warrant
and
went
and
searched
the
house,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
then
they
found
the
packages
exactly
as
the
informant
said
they
would,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
problem
about
his
veracity
then?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
informant
had
said
to
the
police
that
he
had
been
in
the
home
of
this
man
on
a
day
within
recent
weeks
or
months,
and
he
could
not
remember
the
day
or
the
week,
but
that
he
distinctly
saw
him
putting
narcotics
in
packages
on
that
day
unnamed?
it
would
make
it
a
little
difficult
for
the
man
to
say
he
wasn't
there
at
that
time,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
sufficient
to
issue
a
warrant
if
the
informant
could
not
fix
the
date?
unknown
speaker
who
was
it
that
had
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
here
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
said
he
was
out
on
a
fishing
trip
on
that
day?
unknown
speaker
without
a
jury?
unknown
speaker
and,
is
that
an
in
camera
proceeding
in
colorado
or
is
it
an
open
hearing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stern,
do
you
think
that
applying
the
standard
and
the
balancing
explained
in
the
roviaro
opinion
under
the
federal
standard
for
when
an
informant's
identity
will
be
disclosed,
that
the
disclosure
would
have
been
ordered
in
this
case
applying
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
there
would
have
been
disclosure?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
colorado
court
applied
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
chronology
doesn't
lead,
i
would
think,
to
the
necessary
conclusion
that
there
is
not
a
federal
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
colorado's
decision.
it
is
just
that
its
decision
is
a
narrower
one
than
you
say
your
opponents
have
painted.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
this
question...
supposing
that
the
district
court
in
adams
county
says
i
am
going
to
order
the
disclosure
of
this
informant
pursuant
to
roviaro,
which
i
think
as
being
on
us,
the
no
suppression,
but,
in
like
hickman
against
hiller
where
someone
has
to
go
to
jail
in
order
to
raise
a
question
in
appellate
court,
the
district
court
says,
no,
we
won't
disclose,
but
i
am
going
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
colorado.
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
says
under
roviaro
this
informant
should
have
been
disclosed.
i
think
that
person
can
come
here
and
say
you
have
got
a
federal
question,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
just
say
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
roviaro
is
itself
a
decision
which
construes
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but,
mccray,
of
course,
would
be
construing
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can
be
more
favorable
to
the
defendant,
criminal
defendant
in
that
area.
it
can't
be
less
favorable.
isn't
that
what
it--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
if
you
are
right,
whether
this
is
quite
a
sensible
opinion
of
the
supreme
court...
we
can
think
they
are
bananas
if
we
want
to,
but
if
it
is
the
state
ground,
it
is
none
of
our
business.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
on
the
reference
to
roviaro,
is
it
the
state's
position
that
that
was
a
constitutional
case?
unknown
speaker
then,
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
colorado
supreme
court's
reference
to
roviaro?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
citation
of
roviaro,
which
is
a
non-constitutional
case,
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
suggest
that
they
thought
they
had
a
non-constitutional
issue
before
them?
unknown
speaker
but,
to
the
extent
that
roviaro
sheds
any
light
on
the
matter,
it
would
point
in
that
direction,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
earlier
colorado
cases
did
precede
franks
against
delaware,
didn't
they?
