mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
way
this
case
has
been
postured,
both
in
the
briefs
and
during
oral
argument,
is
inconsistent
with
the
record
below.
the
petitioner
has
raised
and
melded
together
three
separate
issues,
only
one
of
which
was
ever
adjudicated
in
the
colorado
court
system.
in
colorado,
the
process
of
challenging
a
search
warrant,
in
making
a
veracity
challenge,
has
three
separate
steps.
one
step
is
making
a
threshold
preliminary
showing
to
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
first
place.
the
second
step
is
actually
being
successful
on
the
merits--
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
--in
colorado?
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
well,
the
purpose
of
the
veracity
hearing
at
this
point
in
time
under
colorado
law
is
to
see
if
the
affiant
either
committed
perjury
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth.
the
colorado
supreme--
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
--one,
does
the
information
even
exist;
and,
two,
if
the
informant
does
exist,
did
he
actually
relate
to
the
affiant
what
the
affiant
placed
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
in
the
affidavit
there
is
certain
information
allegedly
stated
by
an
informant.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
it
was
that
on
a
certain
date
that
the
informant
was
in
the
home
of
the
defendant
and
observed
the
defendant
engaged
in
certain
conduct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
the
conduct
was
packaging
heroin.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
they
did
find
heroin.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
obviously,
it
would
have
some
bearing,
chief
justice,
however,
there
are
other
possible
sources
of
information
that
could
have
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
mr.
nunez
had
heroin
which
didn't
come
through
an
informant.
in
fact,
a
number
of
the
commentators
have
stated
that
it
is
possible
that
information
could
have
come
through
an
illegal
wiretap.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
correct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
correct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
very
close
to
how
he
said
they
would
be,
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
the
problem
about
his
veracity
is
that
the
defendant
testified
that
the
informant
could
not
have
done
what
it
was
alleged
he
had
done
in
the
affidavit
because
on
those
dates
in
question
the
defendant
had
not
been
in
his
home.
he
was
away
for
two
weeks.
he
could
not
have
been
delivering
heroin
using
his
vehicle
during
those
two
weeks.
he
was
not
in
his
home
when
the
informant
said
he
was
there.
he
was
on
a
fishing
trip
and
that
the
only
people
who
were
there
the
second
half
of
the
day
were
his
immediate
relatives.
so,
there
was
testimony
from
the
defendant
that
created
in
the
mind
of
the
trial
court
judge
a
good
faith
basis
and
fact
to
question
the
accuracy
of
the
affidavit.
and,
under
that
particular
test,
under
colorado
law--
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
--that
would
create
a
different
problem
of
proof.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
that
would
be
up
to
the
magistrate
to
determine
if
that
was
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
however,
in
the
instant
case,
you
have
an
informant
saying
he
was
located
in
the
house
at
a
particular
time
when,
based
upon
testimony
under
oath
by
the
defendant
and
other
collateral
evidence,
he
could
not...
at
least
created
a
reasonable
basis
and
fact
to
believe
that
he
could
not
have
been
in
the
house,
and,
therefore,
colorado,
under
colorado's
common
law,
as
an
evidentiary
matter
allows
the
informant
to
be
disclosed,
either
in
camera
or
to
all
the
parties
so
that
the
defendant
can
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
make
the
showing
that
he
must
make
at
the
veracity
hearing
itself.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
the
trial
court
judge.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
without
a
jury.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
well,
the
first
stage
where
the
defendant
must
meet
his
burden
of
showing
good
faith
basis
and
fact...
the
affidavit
contains
inaccuracies...
is
an
opening
hearing.
if
after
hearing
that,
the
trial
court
judge
decides
that
the
defendant
has
met
his
burden
and,
therefore,
is
entitled
to
either
disclosure
in
camera
or
to
all
the
parties,
then
they
would
proceed
accordingly.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
applying
that
standard,
i
believe
it
would
nave
been.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
there
would
have
been
disclosure.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
i
do
not.
as
i
was
stating
before,
the
issue
regarding
a
preliminary
threshold
showing
and
the
issue
of
what
you
must
prove
to
be
successful
at
the
veracity
hearing
itself
were
never
raised
in
this
case.
in
fact,
if
you
were
to
remand
this
case...
the
motion
to
suppress
which
contained
the
veracity
challenge
is
still
pending
before
the
trial
court.
it
was
never
decided.
the
only
issue
ever
decided
was
disclosure
of
confidential
informants.
so,
therefore,
if
the
case
was
reversed,
we
would
pick
up
with
that
veracity
challenge
and
go
to
hearing
on
it.
suppression
was
not
issued
pursuant
to
the
fourth
amendment.
suppression
was
issued
as
a
discovery
sanction.
after
the
motion
to
disclose,
informant
was
decided,
was
heard,
the
trial
court
judge
ordered
disclosure.
when
the
prosecution
did
not
comply
with
that
discovery
order,
the
defense
counsel
filed
a
second
motion
to
suppress.
that
second
motion
to
suppress,
which
was
ultimately
granted,
was
based
as
a
sanction
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
discovery
order.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
my
response
is
twofold.
first,
the
only
issue
is
the
motion
to
disclose
informant.
second,
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
nunez
opinion,
there
is
not
one
federal
authority
cited,
not
one
federal
case
cited.
it
is
only
state
cases.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
that
is
absolutely
not
what
happened,
because,
again,
if
you
look
at
the
four
corners
of
the
nunez
opinion,
they
don't
mention
a
single
federal
case
or
federal
authority.
even
if
this
court
should
decide
to
go
beyond
the
four
corners
of
the
opinion
and
look
to
the
underlying
cases,
yes,
roviaro
is
mentioned.
however,
in
no
way
is
it
mentioned
as
being
compelling
or
binding
upon
the
colorado
supreme
court.
in
fact,
the
particular
rules
of
law
which
govern
disclosure
in
colorado,
number
one,
that
there
be
a
good
faith
basis
and
fact
to
question
the
accuracy
of
the
affidavit;
and,
number
two,
that
a
defendant
must
show
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
and
fact
to
believe
either,
one,
the
informant
doesn't
exist,
or,
two,
if
he
does
exist,
he
did
not
relate
to
the
police
officer
what
is
contained
in
the
affidavit,
are
unique
creations
of
colorado
law.
when
the
colorado
supreme
court
made
these
specific
rules,
they
did
not
cite
any
federal
authority
at
all.
in
fact,
they
didn't
even
cite
the
authority
from
any
other
jurisdiction.
this
is
the
creation
of
colorado
law
pure
and
simple.
and,
roviaro
is
mentioned,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
states
even
explicitly
or
implicitly
that
we
are
compelled
to
follow
roviaro.
we
are
required
to
follow
roviaro.
in
fact,
the
model
penal
code
is
also
mentioned.
professor
lafave's
treatise
on
search
and
seizure
is
mentioned.
neither
of
them
are
mentioned
in
any
kind
of
binding
way,
but
merely
for
guidance.
and,
when
the
decision
is
actually
made,
it
is
again
a
unique
creation
of
colorado
law.
and,
yes,
there
is
no
plain
statement
pursuant
to
michigan
v.
long.
and,
as
the
questions
clearly
showed,
the
decision
in
michigan
v.
long
came
five
months
after
the
decision
in
nunez.
but,
what
we
really
have
in
this
case
is
not
a
situation
where
we
are
arguing
or
where
the
respondent
is
arguing
that
there
is
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground,
because
that
implies
that
there
is
a
federal
ground
to
begin
with,
and
it
is
the
respondent's
position
that
there
is
no
federal
ground
whatsoever
in
the
instant
case.
it
was
determined
entirely
on
state
law.
and,
that
the
other
issues
regarding
preliminary
threshold
showing
and
regarding
what
a
defendant
needs
to
be
successful
on
a
veracity
challenge
were
matters
decided
in
other
cases.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
dailey
case,
what
the
colorado
supreme
court
said
about
veracity
challenges
is
not
only
consistent
with
franks,
but
they
stated
our
rule
was
the
same
prior
to
franks.
and,
in
fact,
in
the
appendix
to
the
franks
decision,
it
lists
colorado
as
one
of
the
states
that
allows
a
veracity
challenge
based
upon
the
exact
same
showing
that
came
down
in
franks
v.
delaware
prior
to
your
decision.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
roviaro
is...
this
court,
as
i
understand
it,
is
acting
in
a
supervisory
capacity
dealing
with
an
evidentiary
matter
based
upon
federal
common
law.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
absolutely.
and,
in
fact,
it
was
mccray
that
established
clearly
that
roviaro
was
not
constitutional
litigation
or
adjudication,
but
was
rather
this
court
acting
in
a
supervisory
capacity.
and,
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
mccray
from
what
colorado
has
done.
in
fact,
i
think
the
mccray
decision
is
the
most
supportive
of
the
authority
and
right
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
create
evidentiary
rules
regarding
the
common
law
informant's
privilege
as
it
sees
fit,
just
the
way
it
can
create
privileges
with
respect
to
the
husband
and
wife
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
well,
the
only
way,
in
my
opinion,
that
the
united
states
constitution
would
get
involved
in
this
question
would
be
if
the
colorado
supreme
court
interpreted
the
common
law
informant's
privilege
in
such
a
way
that
it
infringed
upon
defendant's
rights.
for
example,
if
it
said
a
defendant
may
never
get
disclosure
for
trial
or
at
a
suppression
hearing,
that
would
run
afoul
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but,
if
colorado
did
come
up
with
a
liberal
interpretation,
certainly
since
there
is
no
constitutional
principle
or
no
constitutional
right
enjoyed
by
a
law
enforcement
agent
or
by
the
informant
to
not
have
the
identity
disclosed,
i
don't
believe
that
emanates
from
any
constitutional
provision,
but
rather
from
the
common
law.
given
that
fact,
as
long
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
does
not
run
afoul
of
another
constitutional
provision
by
cutting
off
some
of
defendant's
other
rights,
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
constitutional
issue
at
all.
and,
it
is
not
even
a
federal
issue
which
we
have
been
arguing
throughout
these
proceedings.
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
state
concern.
and,
again,
as
justice
marshall
inquired,
colorado
has
not
adopted
any
kind
of
per
se
rule
so
that
any
time
there
is
an
informant
in
an
affidavit
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
disclosure.
in
fact,
colorado,
in
its
decisions,
has
clearly
stated
it
supports
the
common
law
informant's
privilege.
it
gives
it
a
great
deal
of
weight.
and,
in
reaction
to
that
in
the
instant
case,
it
states
that
a
defendant
must
make
a
preliminary
showing.
there
is
a
mandatory
showing
a
defendant
must
make
before
he
can
gain
disclosure.
and,
secondly,
there
is
another
safeguard
built
in
and
that
is
the
in
camera
hearing,
which
in
this
case
was
not
requested
by
the
prosecution,
but
in
other
cases
has
been
requested
and
has
been
granted,
and
is
a
way
to
actually
balance
this
very
difficult
problem
between
keeping
the
information--
mr.
kenneth
h.
stern
--that
is
true.
i
was
hoping
to
convey
the
opinion
that
they
weren't
bananas,
but--
[laughter]
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
conclusion,
respondents
would
argue
that
the
writ
that
previously
has
been
granted
in
this
case
should
be
dismissed
as
being
improvidently
granted
or,
at
a
minimum,
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
