ms.
ruth
e.
peters
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
here
today
in
the
first
federal
labor
relations
authority
case
to
be
heard
by
this
court
is
the
authority's
determination
that
a
federal
employee
union
representative
who
is
granted
official
time
to
participate
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations
is
entitled
to
receive
a
per
diem
allowance
and
travel
expenses
from
the
employer
agency
for
travel
in
connection
with
the
negotiations.
now
as
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
in
this
case
the
authority's
determination
is
correct
essentially
for
these
reasons:
first,
because
the
authority
correctly
discerned
the
congressional
objectives
underlying
the
federal
sector
labor
statute
and
adopted
an
interpretation
of
the
official
time
provision
that
comports
with
and
furthers
those
objectives;
and
second,
because
employee
representatives
who
are
on
official
time
for
negotiations
are
engaged
in
official
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
travel
expense
act
and
are
accordingly
entitled
to
the
payment
of
travel
expenses.
now
i
intend
to
discuss
both
of
those
points,
and
in
the
process
i
also
hope
to
discuss
the
ways
in
which
the
nature
and
scope
and
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
under
the
federal
sector
statute
differs
from
bargaining
under
the
old
executive
order
program
or
in
the
private
sector
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
ultimately
the
test
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
authority's
determination
is
not
whether
it
would
have
been
appropriate
under
the
old
executive
orders
or
in
the
private
sector,
but
rather--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--i
do
not
think
congress
overlooked
it.
it
did
not
address
it
directly,
but
it
did
choose
a
certain
term
"official
time"
from
which
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
say
that
certain
consequences
flow.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
it
had
in
mind
what
status
it
wanted
these
people
to
be
on
while
they
were
bargaining,
negotiating
and--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--i
think
that
congress
could
have
seen
that
it
chose
the
phrase
nteu,
in
this
regard
that
it
is
significant
that
congress
chose
this
term
because
it
does
equate
with
duty
time
or
work
time
and
is
different
from
nonduty
time
or
leave
or
administrative
leave
or
excused
absence.
we
are
not
the
only
ones
to
see
this
distinction.
even
the
petitioner,
i
think,
at
footnote
five
of
its
reply
brief
sees
a
difference
between
official
time
on
the
one
hand
and
leave
time
on
the
other.
the
executive
orders
distinguished
between
official
time
and
nonduty
time.
executive
order
10988,
for
example,
said
that
employer-employee
meetings
should
be
conducted
on
official
time
wherever
possible
but
that
the
employer
could
require
that
negotiations
be
conducted
on
nonduty
time.
furthermore,
as
we
noted--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
i
certainly
do
not
agree
with
the
petitioner's
approach
to
the
authority
that
they
have
cited
in
their
brief.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
that
deal
with
the
federal
work
force
that
have
broad
statutory
terms
such
as
"official
time"
or
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
for
example,
"hours
of
work".
there
are
a
number
of
remedial
and
compensatory
statutes
that
have
such
terms.
if
that
rule
were
to
be
applied
really
strictly
it
would
just
shut
off
one
side
of
the
ability
to--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
statute
that
says
official
time--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--no,
because
i
think
official
time
means
duty
time
or
duty
status
and
that
connotes
that
it
is
official
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
travel
expense
act
and
that
the
things
that
you
have
going
when
you
are
on
official
time,
paid
time,
time
for
which
you
are
paid
by
the
government--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
that
would
be
a
subject
i
guess
for
the
gsa
travel
regulations
as
to
what
kind
of
carrier
you
can
take,
but
that
is
not
really
the
issue
here.
as
i
was
saying,
we
are
not
the
only
ones
to
see
the
difference
between
official
time
and
duty
time.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
our
sole
reliance
on
that?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
our
reliance
is
on
that
and
our
reliance
is
on
the
congressional
objectives
and
purposes
where
they
found
collective
bargaining
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
right.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
right.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
is
right.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
management
relations
regulations
under
the
executive
order
provided
that
witnesses
at
hearings
be
granted
official
time,
and
they
also
got
travel
expenses.
he
precluded
the
payment
of
overtime
for
them.
also
as
i
remember--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
we
have
that
and
then,
of
course,
under
executive
order
10988
did
provide
that
meetings
and
consultations
could
be
conducted
on
official
time
and
the
comptroller
general
first
said
that
they
could
not
get
travel
expenses
either
but
then
he
modified
that
in
keeping
with
the
civil
service
commission
guidelines
so
that
it
would
seem
that
in
some
circumstances--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--pardon?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
he
modified
it
by
saying
that
travel
expenses
could
be
paid
pursuant
to
the
civil
service
commission
guidelines
which
those
guidelines
for
the
most
part
did
not
allow
the
payment
of
travel
expenses
for
negotiations.
but
then
negotiations
under
that
executive
order...
the
use
of
official
time
was
not
encouraged
for
negotiations
under
that
executive
order,
but
one
could
assume
that
for
the
activities
for
which
official
time
could
be
used
or
was
encouraged
under
the
executive
order
assumably
travel
expenses
could
be
paid.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
you
mean
before
the
act?
i
do
not
have
anything
that
i
can
cite
to,
but
as
i
recall...
well,
i
do
not
have
anything
i
can
cite
to
on
that.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
in
the
payment...
well,
people
are
sort
of
waiting
to
see
what
this
court
does
on
it
before--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--not
that
i
know
of,
no,
but
that
is
because
the
matter
has
been
in
litigation
i
believe.
i
would
note
that
other
attributes
of
employment
do
attach
to
time
spent
in
negotiations,
example,
we
noted
in
our
brief
that
the
office
of
personnel
management
in
the
federal
personnel
manual
letter
characterized
official
time
spent
on
representational
functions
as
hours
of
work.
now
that
characterization
on
the
part
of
opm
has
an
operative
significance
beyond
that
fpm
letter
because
the
same
phrase
appears
in
its
regulations
applying
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
federal
employees,
and
there
opm
provides
in
5cfr551.424b
that
official
time
is
hours
of
work
for
fsla
purposes.
on
the
other
hand,
it
says
that
such
things
leave
and
holidays
and
excused
absences
which
it
call
paid
periods
of
nonwork
in
5cfr551.401
is
not
hours
of
work
for
fsla
purposes.
so
that
is
one
attribute
of
employment
that
attaches
to
someone
on
official
time.
then
as
we
have
also
noted--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
was
opm.
that
was
opm
which
administers
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
it
applies
to
federal
employees.
as
we
have
also
noted--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--they
are
separate
agencies
with
separate
areas
of
responsibility.
as
we
also
noted
an
employee
who
would
be
injured
traveling
to
or
from
negotiations
would
be
considered
to
be
injured
in
the
course
of
duty
for
federal
employee
compensation
act
purposes,
and
it
also--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--that
may
be,
but
my
point
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
attributes
of
employment
that
attach
to
someone
who
is
in
the
federal
sector
on
official
time
for--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--i
think
that
perhaps
more
instructive
than
the
various
factors
that
support
our
view
that
it
is
official
business,
that
time
spent
negotiating
is
official
business
is
the
fact
that
petitioner
really
has
not
provided
any
reason
why
negotiations
should
not
be
considered
official
business.
petitioner
suggested
a
test
which
says
that
official
business...
that
an
activity
is
not
official
business
unless
it
is
conducted
under
the
direction
of
a
supervisor
or
that
the
quality
of
the
employee's
performance
can
be
appraised.
however,
the
petitioner
has
cited
no
support
in
statute
or
regulation
or
case
authority
for
that
test.
in
fact,
the
authority
cited
at
pages
42
and
43
of
our
brief
which
indicates
that
the
official
business
designation
is
given
to
activities
that
are
not
directly
mission
related
contradicts
that
contention.
that
authority
applies,
for
example,
to
employees
who
attend
administrative
employment-related
hearings
about,
for
example,
their
own
suspensions
or
their
own
performance
appraisal
appeal,
and
it
shows
that
it
covers
things
such
as
going
to
meetings
and
conferences
and
seminars
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
may
or
may
not
be
directly
mission-related.
petitioner
also
points
to
the
language
of
section
7131(a)
which
specifies
that
an
employee
who
is
on
official
time
will
be
on
official
time
for
the
time
that
the
employee
otherwise
would
be
in
duty
status.
the
petitioner
suggests
that
congress
intended
by
this
language
either
to
say
that
they
were
not
really
on
duty
time
or
that
because
they
would
generally
travel
and
take
meals
while
they
are
not
on
duty
time
that
congress
meant
by
this
language
to
preclude
travel
expenses.
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
very
similar
language
appeared
in
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor's
regulations
under
the
executive
order
and
there
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
were
paid,
but
overtime
was
excluded.
the
language
also
appears
in
opm's
flsa
regulations
regarding
official
time
where
it
appears
to
be
viewed
merely
as
the
restriction
on
the
amount
of
unscheduled
overtime
that
can
be
counted
as
hours
of
work.
so
i
think
the
most
reasonable
view
of
that
language
is
that
it
is
a
restriction
on
the
payment
of
overtime
and
premium
paid
to
employees
who
are
involved
in
negotiations
and
not
on
the
payment
of
travel
expenses.
petitioner
has
also
suggested
here
today
and
in
the
reply
brief
that
"official
time"
is
a
term
of
art
simply
used
in
labor
relations
programs
and
that
it
does
not
operate
to
signify
entitlement
to
travel
and
per
diem.
well,
the
term
"official
time"
was
used
in
the
executive
orders,
and
it
is
used
in
the
federal
sector
statute,
but
it
has
no
more
artful
use
than
to
signify
that
certain
activities
are
to
be
conducted
on
duty
time,
paid
time
rather
than
on
nonduty
time.
this
usage
supports
rather
than
defeats
the
notion
that
the
employee
who
is
engaged
in
activities
that
are
conducted
on
official
time
is
engaged
in
official
business.
so
as
far
as
our
position
that
this
is
official
business,
that
negotiations
is
official
business
i
would
point
then
to
the
way
congress
characterized
the
time
spent
in
the
activity
and
the
great
importance
that
it
attached
to
the
activity,
that
is,
that
it
is
something
that
is
in
the
public
interest.
the
nature
of
the
activity,
that
is,
that
it
is
employment
related.
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
something
that
is
federal
employment
related
could
fall
within
the
sphere
of
official
business
and
in
fact
as
i
indicated
people
who
attend
administrative
hearings
about
their
own
grievances
or
suspensions
or
performance
appraisal
appeals
are
considered
to
be
on
official
business
and
entitled
to
travel
expenses.
so
i
think
all
those
factors
point
to
the
conclusion
that
these
employees
are
on
official
business.
now
i
would
like
to
address
the
deference
point
because
when
the
authority
based
on
the
goals
and
objectives
of
its
statute
also
determined
that
employees
are
engaged
in
official
business
within
the
meaning
of
the
travel
expense
act
the
courts
that
ruled
adversely
on
this
issue
and
the
petitioner
take
the
position
that
for
that
reason
the
authority
is
owed
less
than
usual
deference
because
it
refers
to
another
statute.
now
first
of
all
as
both
judges
haney
and
oakes
pointed
out
in
their
dissents
in
the
eighth
and
second
circuits
this
position
of
the
petitioner
and
the
other
courts
is
in
error
because
first
of
all
the
very
core
of
the
authority's
analysis
here
is
of
the
interpretation
of
the
terms
of
its
own
statute,
but
in
any
event
the
notion
that
the
authority
is
necessarily
owed
less
deference
in
cases
such
as
this
where
in
order
to
resolve
completely
an
issue
under
its
own
statute
it
has
to
look
outside
in
an
ancillary
fashion
at
another
statute--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
first
i
would
note
that
gsa
which
has
authority
under
the
travel
expense
act
in
its
regulations
has
essentially
said
that
individual
agencies
can
authorize
travel
and
thus
determine
whether
it
is
official
business
or
not
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
i
would
think
it
would
be
fair
to
take
from
that
that
when
an
agency
is
affected
by
someone
else's
enabling
statute
such
as
the
flra
statute
that
it
is
up
to
the
flra
to
determine
what
is
official
business
within
the
meaning
of
that
enabling
statute.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
but
an
individual
federal
agency
besides
having
its
own
enabling
statute
is
covered
by
a
number
of
statutes
and
regulations
dealing,
well,
such
as
in
this
case
with
federal
personnel
matters,
and
travel
could
be
connected
with
those
statutes
as
well.
it
would
seem
reasonable
that
the
person
responsible
or
the
agency
responsible
for
those
statutes
would
determine
whether
something
is
official
business
within
the
terms
of
that
statute.
as
i
was
saying
this
notion
that
the
authority
is
necessarily
owed
less
deference
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
it
finds
it
necessary
to
look
outside
to
another
statute
has
troubling
implications
not
only
for
this
case
but
also
for
the
authority's
ability
in
the
future
to
function
in
the
way
that
congress
intended.
the
authority
has
a
unique
enabling
statute
and
in
some
instances
there
is
an
express
direction
that
they
may
have
to
look
outside
the
statute
in
order
to
resolve
completely
an
issue
arising
under
the
statute.
for
example,
in
section
7117
under
which
the
authority
makes
determinations
of
negotiability
it
must
determine
according
to
congress
whether
a
union
bargaining
proposal
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
federal
law
or
any
government-wide
rule
or
regulation.
now
the
congress
did
not
set
out
a
separate
standard
of
review
for
negotiability
determinations,
however.
the
standard
of
review
for
those
final
orders
is
the
same
as
for
other
final
orders
of
the
authority.
that
is,
it
will
not
be
set
aside
unless
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
i
think
that
it
is
just
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
even
where
congress
has
not
made
it
express
that
an
agency
such
as
the
flra
that
administers
a
federal
sector
collective
bargaining
program
will
from
time
to
time
have
to
resolve
issues
that
in
an
ancillary
fashion
implicate
federal
personnel
laws
or
regulations
or
other
laws
or
regulations
affecting
the
federal
work
force
or
work
place
and
this
case
is
an
example--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--sure.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
sure.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
they
might
try
to
take
it
up
through
the
unfair
labor
practice
route.
if
they
were
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
also
i
would
imagine
be
the
topic
for
a
negotiated
grievance
procedure,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
even
if
they
ask
that
the
authority
review
it
that
a
complaint
would
issue
or
that
if
a
complaint
did
issue--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--pardon?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
if
it
came
up
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
yes.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
if
he
raised
that
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
matter,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
you
might
try
to
bring
it
up
that
way
but
it
would
not
necessarily
be
a
violation
of
the
act
and
the
general
counsel
would
not
necessarily
issue
a
complaint.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
the
authority
would
be
bound
by
the
gsa's
federal
travel
regulations
which
it
recently
recognized
in
a
negotiability
determination
are
a
government-wide
regulation
and
that
an
issue
cannot
be...
for
example,
a
union
bargaining
proposal
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
travel
regulations,
and
i
believe
that
there--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--well,
one
point
in
that
regard
is
that
gsa
has
never
before
or
since
the
authority's
determination
said
anything
like
that
nor
has
congress.
it
has
been
silent
in
the
nearly
four
years
since
the
authority
has
made
this
determination
even
though
it
has
used
the
official
time
language--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--if
they
had
such
a
regulation?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
that
said
that--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--if
he
issued
a
decision
or
if
the
gsa
instead
of
having
the
regulation
saying
that
an
agency
may
determine
whether
it
is
authorized
travel
or
not,
yes,
it
would
be
a
different
case
and
the
authority
would
have
to
look
at
those
regulations.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
traditionally
the
comptroller
general
has
given
leeway
ever
since
the
civil
service
commission
days
to
the
labor
relations
body
to
determine
the
travel
expenses
and
official
time
question.
at
this
point
the
comptroller
general
has
noticed
that
even
as
to
his
official
time
rulings
under
the
executive
orders
that
because
of
the
nature
of
section
7131
which
is
very
specific
and
departs
from
the
executive
orders
he
considers
his
decisions
under
the
executive
orders
on
that
issue
to
be
superseded
to
the
extent
that
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
new
law.
ms.
ruth
e.

overall
or--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--in
this
particular
case
or
government-wide?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
in
this
issue
generally.
no.
petitioner
i
believe
cited
a
speech
by
an
opm
official
suggesting
$2
million,
a
figure
something
like
that,
but
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
really
documentable--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--hard
evidence
on
that
point.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
pardon?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
i
see.
but
on
the
area
of
cost,
i
would
point
out
that
any
discussion
of
the
cost
of
the
authority's
determination
must
necessarily
take
into
account
the
benefits
that
congress
viewed
as
being
derived
from
collective
bargaining
such
as
increased
productivity
or
more
efficient
government
which
would
in
some
sense
cut
down
on
the
overall
cost
of
government
one
would
think.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
i
have
not
a
single
commentator
to
cite,
student
or
nonstudent.
i
would
note
that
the
statute
by
its
own
terms
and
also
the
authority
decisions
set
limits
on
the
entitlement
to
official
time
and
thus
accordingly
to
the
entitlement
to
travel
and
per
diem.
section
7131
expressly
limits
the
number
of
employee
representatives
who
are
entitled
to
official
time
to
the
number
of
management
representatives,
and
that
is
a
number,
of
course,
that
is
within
the
control
of
the
agency.
the
statute
also
limits
official
time
entitlement
to
federal
employees
so
that
any
union
staff
members
who
are
involved
in
the
negotiations
will
not
receive
either
official
time
or
travel
expenses.
the
statute
prohibits
the
use
of
official
time
for
internal
union
matters
so
that
it
is
only
the
activities
which
congress
perceives
as
being
in
the
public
interest
for
which
official
time
can
be
used.
the
authority
has
placed
limits
on
the
entitlement
to
official
time.
it
has
ruled
that
an
employee
negotiator
in
order
to
receive
official
time
must
be
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
involved
in
the
negotiations
and
not
another
bargaining
unit.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
that
is
generally
one
of
the
ground
rules
that
has
to
be
established
by
the
parties.
i
would
imagine
that
the
management
representatives
unless
they
want
to
go
to
hawaii
will
make
some
efforts
to
keep
the
meeting
from
being
held
there.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
not
if
it
is
official
business
i
do
not
think,
but
in
any
event
that
is
a
matter
for
parties
to
determine
and
in
fact
given
the
number
of
nation-wide
bargaining
units
that
is
one
additional
factor
in
support
of
the
authority's
determination
because
it
facilitates
the
parties
coming
to
agreement
on
where
to
hold
the
meetings
so
that
if
all
the
management
representatives
are
already
centrally
located
in
washington,
d.c.,
for
example,
they
can
bring
the
union
representatives
in
there
and
there
will
not
be
any
cost
of
travel
for
the
management
representatives
at
all.
i
would
address
one
final
point
and
that
is
the
third
ground
upon
which
the
authority
relied
in
defining
which
the
ninth
circuit
relied
in
finding
that
the
authority's
determination
was
correct
and
that
is
that
the
authority's
reading
of
the
official
time
provision
of
section
7131a
which
entitled
negotiators
to
payment
of
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
is
consistent
with
the
authority's
reading
of
section
7131c
which
enables
the
authority
to
determine
that
an
employer
agency
will
grant
official
time
and
in
the
authority's
view
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
to
employee
participants
in
authority
proceedings.
now
the--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--it
is
different
from
private
collective
bargaining
first
of
all
because
in
the
private
sector
there
is
no
statutory
official
time
requirement
and
secondly
because
both
the
parties
to
private
bargaining
are
private
parties
there
is
not
even
a
question
of
equalizing
public
funding
support.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
i
think
there
are
differences
in
the
nature
and
scope
and
structure
of
private
sector
bargaining
as
compared
to
federal
sector
bargaining
which
means
that
it
may
well
not
be
an
appropriate
determination
in
the
private
sector
but
it
is
supportable
here.
the
scope
of
bargaining
in
the
private
sector
is
very
broad
entailing
a
large
number
of
economic
items
for
one
thing,
and
in
the
structure
emphasis
is
upon
private
ordering
with
the
parties
largely
left
free
to
muster
up
whatever
economic
forces
they
can
to
bring
to
bear
on
the
issues.
for
that
nature
the
nature
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
private
sector
is
often
referred
to
as
economic
warfare
with
each
side
having
an
arsenal
of
economic
weapons
such
as
strike
or
lock
out
to
enforce
their
views
in
bargaining
issues.
now
in
the
federal
sector
that
is
much
different.
the
scope
is
narrow
with
no
bargaining
over
items
such
as
wages
or
pensions
or
a
host
of
other
items
that
would
be
bargainable.
in
the
structure--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--because
it
dictates
that
there
is
a
different
nature
of
bargaining.
while
certainly
the
bargaining
that
occurs
in
the
federal
sector
is
an
arms
length
transaction
with
independent
views
being
expressed
by
both
sides
of
the
table,
it
cannot
be
characterized
as
economic
warfare
because
there
are
no
economic
weapons.
we
are
not
concerned
about
an
economic
balance,
and
there
are
no
legal
economic
weapons
such
as
strike
or
lock
out.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
because
it
is
a
question
here.
entitlement
to
official
time
turns
upon
what
in
the
private
sector
would
turn
upon
perhaps
a
company
rule
governing
travel
expenses.
here
it
turns
upon
a
federal
statute
which
says
if
something
is
official
business
that
it
is
official
time.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
that
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me.
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
this
were
not
official
business
and
the
authority
is
bound
in
a
negotiability
situation
if
there
were
a
union
bargaining
proposal
that
travel
expenses
be
paid
but
this
court
has
found
that
collective
bargaining
negotiation
time
is
not
official
business
it
may
well
be.
it
certainly
is
arguable
that
that
proposal
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
law
or
government
regulation
so
that
it
could
not
be--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--the
wage
payment?
the
wage
payment...
well,
the
congress
did
express,
though,
that
they
were
to
be
on
paid
time
just
as
management
was
on
paid
time.
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
management
is
an
official
business
so
if
they
are
on
paid
time
the
same
as
management--
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
--pardon?
ms.
ruth
e.
peters
well,
in
our
view
the
employee
is
on
official
business.
