ms.
carolyn
corwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
a
straightforward
one.
it
is
whether
congress
intended
for
union
dues
or
the
federal
taxpayers
to
fund
the
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
of
federal
employees
who
represent
their
unions
in
collective
bargaining.
federal
agencies
pay
such
expenses
for
their
own
representatives
at
collective
bargaining
sessions.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
respondent.
the
federal
labor
relations
authority,
correctly
concluded
that
congress
also
meant
for
the
agencies
to
fund
the
similar
expenses
of
the
union
representatives
to
those
sessions.
the
statute
the
court
must
construe
in
this
case
is
title
vii
of
the
civil
service
reform
act
passed
by
congress
in
1978.
title
vii
establishes
a
statutory
framework
for
the
federal
labor
management
relations
program.
that
program
formerly
had
been
governed
by
executive
order,
and
under
the
executive
order
program
the
unions
bore
their
own
travel
expenses
and
per
diem.
there
was
no
entitlement
under
the
executive
order
program
to
any
reimbursement
from
federal
agencies
for
those
expenses.
title
vii
sets
out
a
series
of
detailed
provisions
governing
the
federal
labor
relations
program.
none
of
those
provisions
addresses
the
subject
of
travel
expenses
and
per
diem.
the
authority
has
cited
section
7131
of
the
statute,
and
that
section
relates
to
authorization
of
official
time
for
employee
union
representatives.
in
section
7131
congress
went
quite
far
in
subsidizing
the
collective
bargaining
process
in
the
federal
sector
by
providing
for
federal
payment
of
the
salaries
of
the
employee
union
negotiators.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
respondent,
the
flra,
correctly
concluded
that
congress
meant
to
go
further
in
subsidizing
the
collective
bargaining
process
by
funding
another
category
of
expenses,
the
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
of
the
employee
union
representatives.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that
is
the
understanding.
the
term
"official
time"
is
one
that
had
grown
up
within
the
federal
labor
relations
program
under
the
executive
order.
it
had
always
been
understood
to
connote
payment
of
salary.
now
it
also
meant
that
you
did
not
lose
time
in
terms
of
accruing
other
benefits
such
as
pension
rights
and
so
on,
but
the
basic
principle
was
that
official
time
meant
payment
of
your
salary.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
it
did
not
mean
travel
time
under
the
executive
order
program,
and
we
suggest
that
the
term
"official
time"
as
it
grew
up
in
the
labor
relations
program
indicated
that
you
did
not
have
this
right
to
federal
reimbursement
of
your
travel
time.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
no,
it
definitely--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--the
understanding
of
official
time
was
that
the
salary
was
paid--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--there
were
several
reasons
that...
are
you
referring
to
the
old
executive
order
program
at
this
point?
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
statute
we
are
construing
uses
the
term
"official
time"
as
it
was
used
under
the
executive
order
program
and
that
is
why--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
there
are
several
rationales
that
congress
probably
had
in
mind.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1978
act
you
do
not
have
any
statement
of
why
it
was
that
congress
concluded...
for
example,
in
the
house
report
you
do
not
have
any
explanation
of
why
they
incorporated
this.
what
they
were
in
fact
doing
was
extending
the
provisions
under
the
executive
order
program
in
which
official
time
had
been
available
up
to
a
particular
ceiling.
now
under
the
executive
order
program
the
reasoning
had
been
that
it
prevented
delay.
it
was
easier
to
schedule
sessions
if
you
gave
people
some
time
off
and
it
minimized
the
individual
hardship.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
there
were
several
considerations,
but
the
assumption
that
it
was
official
business
was
not
one
of
them.
under
the
executive
order
program--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--the
comptroller
general
had
been
asked
this
question
early
on
in
the
executive
order
program.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
comptroller
general
had
been
consulted
in
his
capacity
as
the
individual
who
makes
rulings
on
expenditures
of
federal
funds,
and
his
conclusion
was
under
this
executive
order
program
even
if
an
employee
was
granted
official
time,
that
is,
even
if
his
salary
was
paid
that
did
not
translate
into
official
business
for
the
federal
government,
that
in
essence
the
employee--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
several
rationales
were
suggested
in
the
various
reports
underlying
the
executive
order
program.
one
was--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
the
comptroller
general
in
ruling
on
the
official
business
point
suggested
that
even
though
it
had
been
stated
in
the
executive
order
that
collective
bargaining
might
be
in
the
public
interest,
it
was
nevertheless
not
equivalent
to
official
business.
i
do
not
think
the
comptroller
general
cited
the
reports
i
am
referring
to
that
refer
to
the
grant
of
official
time
in
terms
of
solving
scheduling
difficulties
and
in
terms
of
solving
the
individual
hardships
that
might
arise.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that
is
certainly
true,
and
i
think
that
has
always
been
the
case
under
the
federal
labor
relations
program
that
that
clearly
was
a
concern
that
congress
had
in
the
1978
act.
but
i
do
not
think
that
translates
into
any
sort
of
mandate
for
reimbursement
of
all
expenses
underlying
collective
bargaining,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
needs
to
consider
in
determining
whether
congress
without
ever
making
any
mention
of
the
subject
has
authorized
these
sorts
of
expenses
to
be
paid.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
no,
this
is
not
the
practice
in
industry.
the
examples
that
were
before
congress
in
1978
did
not
include
any
example
in
which
the
employer
would
fund
the
collective
bargaining
expenses
of
the
union.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
the
only
instances
in
which
that
occurred
would
be
when
the
parties
had
agreed
to
it
through
a
negotiation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that
is
so,
and
in
1978
i
think
you
have
a
very
careful
consideration
by
congress
in
determining
what
it
ought
to
put
into
this
legislation
about
how
far
it
ought
to
go
in
terms
of--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
the
terminology
"official
time"
is
what
they
picked
up
from
the
old
executive
order
program,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that
they
used
that
term
as
opposed
to
some
other
term
they
might
have
used.
but
you
have
the
very
careful
consideration
in
1978
about
how
much
farther
than
the
executive
order
program
you
ought
to
go
and
to
what
extent
the
federal
government
ought
to
be
subsidizing
the
collective
bargaining
process.
in
essence
what
congress
did
was
to
provide
this
subsidy
of
the
salary
expenses,
but
it
did
not
go
further.
now
we
think
there
are
numerous
indications
that
congress
itself
did
not
intend
this
sort
of
requirement
and
moreover
that
it
did
not
intend
to
delegate
any
sort
of
discretion
to
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
to
impose
that
sort
of
requirement
either.
i
will
summarize
those
points
briefly.
first,
as
i
have
mentioned
there
is
total
silence
in
the
language
in
legislative
history,
and
that
silence
occurs
in
the
context
of
both
the
existing
federal
sector
practice
and
the
private
sector
practice
in
which
unions
bore
their
own
expenses
of
collective
bargaining.
secondly,
as
i
referred
in
response
to
justice
white's
question
the
use
of
the
term
"official
time"
is
significant.
that
is
a
term
that
had
a
particular
meaning
in
the
context
of
the
federal
labor
relations
program.
congress
picked
up
that
term.
third,
what
you
have
here
is
the
authority
reading
into
the
statute
a
requirement
that
has
the
effect
of
imposing
a
monetary
liability
on
the
federal
government,
and
you
have
that
reading
in
the
absence
of
any
expression
of
congressional
intent
that
it
meant
to
go
further
and
to
provide
this
sort
of
subsidy
in
addition
to
what
it
had
provided
for
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
i
think
the
general
principle
that
you
have
set
out
is
one
with
which
we
agree
that
an
administrative
agency
normally
does
deserve
deference.
i
think
there
are
several
points
to
consider
here.
first,
i
think
even
if
one
gave
the
maximum
deference
to
the
agency
in
this
case
it
would
not
overcome
the
indications
i
have
suggested
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
to
go
this
far
and
did
not
intend
the
authority
to
be
able
to--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
i
think
that
there
are
several
other
points
that
you
ought
to
consider
in
determining
whether
deference
is
due
if
that
is
the
concern
here.
i
think
in
addition
to
the
points
i
have
suggested
concerning
what
congress
may
have
had
in
mind
you
ought
to
consider
the
point
about
imposition
of
monetary
liability
on
the
federal
government.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
no,
i
think
that
is
not
the
case
because
congress
clearly
had
in
mind
that
the
remedies
ordered
by
the
authority
would
involve
things
like
back
pay,
and
it
did
include
within
title
vii
a
specific
reference
to
the
back
pay
act
because
it
anticipated
that
this
sort
of
award
was
going
to
come
up
on
a
regular
basis.
it
referred
to
the
section
5596.
the
back
pay
act,
which
is
outside
of
title
vii.
here
you
do
not
have
any
reference
to
the
particular
chapter
57
that
relates
to
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
so
you
do
not
have
congress
making
the
same
sort
of
cross-reference
indicating
that
it
acknowledged
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
monetary
liability,
and
i
think
that
is
another
point
that
the
authority
here
felt
it
necessary
to
go
outside
of
the
limitations
of
its
own
statute,
outside
of
title
vii
and
to
refer
to
chapter
57
which
is
not
within
its
responsibility
for
construction.
rather
it
is
within
the
general
service
administration's
realm
of
authority.
i
think
another
point
to
consider
when
you
determining
the
deference
that
is
due
here
is
that
the
particular
statutory
scheme
is
one
in
which
congress
did
not
leave
much
in
the
way
of
gaps
or
interstices
for
authority
to
fill.
you
have
quite
a
detailed
blueprint
here
which
was
the
product
of
some
very
careful
consideration
by
congress
about
how
far
it
ought
to
go.
it
was
urged
on
the
one
hand
to
stick
with
the
old
executive
order
program
and
simply
to
codify
that.
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
urged
to
go
much
further
in
the
direction
the
employee
unions
wanted
it
to
go.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
i
do
not
think
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
that
the
authority
ought
to
receive
any
deference
because
of
the
principle
that
in
the
case
of
imposition
of
monetary
liability
on
the
federal
government
the
presumption
of
this
court
has
always
been
that
one
does
not
read
that
into
the
statute
absent
some
expression
of
congressional
intent,
but
i
think
even
if
the
court
did
determine
that
there
ought
to
be
some
deference
it
is
not
enough
to
overcome
the
indications
of
that
principle
and
other
indications
that
suggest
that
congress
did
not--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--that
would
be
our
position
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
i
think
that
is
one
point
that
they
have
gone
outside
of
their
own
statute
and
that
diminishes
any
deference.
i
think
the
point
of
what
they
are
doing
imposes
this
monetary
liability.
it
is
something
that
brings
this
other
principle
of
statutory
construction
into
play.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
i
think
that
is
correct.
in
using
the
term
"official
time"
i
think
you
have
to
conclude
that
congress
must
have
intended
it
to
be
official
time
as
it
was
known
to
the
federal--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--yes,
i
think
this
is
a
statute
which
congress
considered
quite
carefully
how
far
to
go,
and
as
i
was
suggesting
to
justice
stevens
there
were
people
who
were
urging
it
to
go
much
further.
there
were
people
who
were
urging
it
to
do
much
less
than
it
did,
and
the
result
is
a
rather
detailed
blueprint
of
the
way
congress
wanted
this
labor
relations
program
to
work.
there
was
provision
of
a
certain
subsidy,
a
rather
generous
subsidy
in
the
form
of
the
salaries,
but
there
was
then
no
further
step.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
i
think
that
general
principle
is
certainly
applicable
here,
but
i
think
in
this
particular
context
in
this
statute
you
do
have
rather
careful
consideration
about
whether
the
congress
ought
to
go
further
in
terms
of
subsidizing
unions
and
subsidizing
collective
bargaining.
the
fact
that
they
did
not
take
the
step
in
this
case
i
think
is
particularly
significant.
i
think
one
has
to
also
consider
the
fact
that
the
statute
reflects
the
fact
that
congress
was
aware
that
there
was
a
source
of
union
funds
out
there
that
unions
would
have
dues
with
which
they
could
pay
such
expenses
and
with
which
they
had
paid
the
expenses
all
along.
it
seems
to
me
that
given
the
assumption
that
unions
would
have
dues
and
that
congress
was
aware
of
this,
it
is
even
more
inappropriate
to
assume
that
congress
without
making
any
mention
at
all
somehow
felt
it
was
appropriate
to
add
on
or
that
the
authority
itself
ought
to
go
further
and
add
on
some
sort
of
financial
requirement
that
would
shift
the
expenses
from
where
they
normally
would
fall
and
where
they
always
had
been
to
the
federal
agencies.
now
all
of
these
considerations
i
have
mentioned
have
led
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
that
have
considered
the
issue
other
than
the
court
below
to
conclude
that
the
authority
exceeded
its
statutory
discretion,
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
is
the
proper
conclusion
based
on
these
considerations
i
have
suggested.
now
i
would
like
to
briefly
turn
to
the
alternative
argument
that
the
authority
and
respondent,
nteu,
have
put
forward
and
that
is
the
argument
that
collective
bargaining
is
somehow
equivalent
to
be
on-the-job
or
on-duty
status
and
that
that
in
turn
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
official
business
here
and
then
you
in
turn
reach
the
conclusion
that
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
were
intended
under
the
statute.
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
simply
does
not
amount
to
what
respondents
are
arguing.
congress
could
have
written
section
7131
with
different
language.
it
could
have
said
collective
bargaining
amounts
to
being
on-duty
status.
better
yet
it
could
have
said
collective
bargaining
for
the
purposes
of
chapter
57,
the
part
that
relates
to
travel
expenses
and
per
diem
outside
of
title
vii,
collective
bargaining
shall
constitute
official
business.
it
did
not
say
any
of
these
things.
rather
the
language
that
congress
did
use
was
and
the
term
of
art
"official
time"
which
had
this
construction
under
the
old
program
of
no
travel
expenses,
no
per
diem,
that
is,
the
unions
for
those
costs
and
congress
also
referred
to
the
time
an
employee
otherwise
would
be
in
a
duty
status.
now
that
language
suggests
that
you
simply
cannot
draw
out
the
equivalency
of
collective
bargaining
and
duty
status
that
respondents
have
suggested
in
this
case,
and
we
think
the
medley
of
various
agency
regulations
and
decisions
that
they
have
cited
from
different
statutes
and
different
periods
of
time
simply
do
not
add
up
to
the
conclusion
they
have
drawn.
i
think
if
you
look
individually
at
those
particular
references
and
look
at
them
collectively
they
do
not
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
collective
bargaining
is
the
same
as
being
on
the
job
or
that
congress
intended
the
authority
to
be
able
to
so
define
it.
ultimately
in
this
case
you
keep
coming
back
to
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
employee
unions
did
not
succeed
in
persuading
congress
or
in
moving
congress
to
the
point
at
which
it
concluded
that
there
ought
to
be
a
federal
subsidy
for
these
particular
expenses.
you
have
congress
silent
on
the
subject
in
the
face
of
the
existing
practice
in
both
the
private
sector
and
the
federal
sector
under
which
the
unions
bore
their
own
expenses
under
which
each
side
to
the
collective
bargaining
bore
its
own
expenses.
you
have
congress
using
a
term
of
art
"official
time"
that
had
a
particular
meaning
under
the
federal
labor
relations
statute
and
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
change
that
meaning.
finally
you
have
no
evidence
in
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
flra
to
go
further,
to
go
beyond
what
congress
itself
had
decided
that
it
would
provide.
you
have
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
the
authority
to
be
in
the
business
of
shifting
expenses
from
the
unions
to
the
federal
agencies.
unless
there
are
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points.
we
are
not
in
any
way
suggesting
that
the
flra
should
never
look
outside
its
own
statute,
and
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
court
with
that
impression.
i
think
that
the
core
of
the
analysis
of
the
flra
does
encompass
a
reference
to
a
statute
outside
of
its
own
jurisdiction,
and
we
suggest
that
that
may
diminish
the
deference
that
is
due
and
we
also
suggest
that
the
authority
is
inconsistent
with
the
general
approach
of
the
general
services
administration
in
this
area
in
which
the
agency
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
its
own
mission
and
to
determine
whether
travel
corresponds
to
that
mission.
to
the
extent
that
ms.
peters
suggested
that
the
term
vii,
i
just
wanted
to
indicate
that
it
does
not.
i
may
have
misunderstood
what
she
said,
but
the
term
"official
business"
shows
up
in
the
general
services
administration
statute.
it
does
not
show
up
in
the
federal
labor
relations
statute.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
point
that
was
raised
about
payment
for
witnesses
at
hearings
and
some
of
the
regulations
of
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor.
there
is
considerable
authority
in
a
lot
of
areas
for
payment
in
relation
to
attendance
at
official
hearings.
the
comptroller
general
has
approved
that
sort
of
payment
not
only
in
the
labor
relations
area
but
in
broader
areas
of
personnel
management.
that
is
not
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
collective
bargaining
negotiations
where
you
do
not
have
any
sort
of
history
of
this
sort
of
payment
being
approved.
in
fact
you
have
articulated
understandings
that
travel
expenses
were
not
included
within
the
concept
of
official
time.
there
was
also
reference
to
office
of
personnel
management
regulations
referring
to
hours
of
work.
i
think
if
you
look
at
those
regulations
that
term
is
not
any
sort
of
substantive
judgment
about
what
an
employee
is
doing
during
representation
or
collective
bargaining.
that
is
basically
an
accounting
or
reporting
term.
you
put
your
hours
into
hours
of
work
and
you
determine
whether
the
minimum
wage
has
been
paid
or
overtime
is
required.
i
do
not
think
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
issue
before
the
court
here.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
yes,
indeed.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
well,
unfortunately
the
situation
and
i
will
try
to
clarify
that
is
that
the
comptroller
general
has
been
asked
for
his
views
under
this
statute.
by
the
time
the
question
was
raised
as
i
understand
it
the
matter
was
already
before
the
authority
and
in
the
courts,
and
the
comptroller
general
has
adopted
regulations
that
say
when
that
is
the
case
unless
both
parties
to
the
dispute
ask
the
comptroller
general
he
will
not
issue
an
opinion
and
therefore
the--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--unfortunately
i
think
by
the
time
somebody
thought
of
that
alternative
things
were
already
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
carolyn
corwin
that
is,
of
course,
a
matter
that
is
of
great
interest
to
the
agencies,
but
i--
ms.
carolyn
corwin
--well,
generally
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
deference
given
to
the
comptroller
general's
views,
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
executive
order
situation
in
which
the
comptroller
general
rules
that
in
the
case
in
which
an
agency
concluded
that
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
government
that
there
could
be
authorization
of
travel
expenses.
now
this
was
by
no
means
a
blanket
authorization.
the
principle
here
articulated
by
the
comptroller
general
was
that
if
the
agency
concludes
that
it
is
for
the
interest
of
the
government,
more
convenient,
will
save
money
overall
that
the
agency
in
a
particular
fact
situation
could
conclude
that
it
was
appropriate
to
pay
the
expenses
but
not
in
the
sort
of
broad
situation
you
have
here
not
generally
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
i
think
one
ought
to
assume
that
congress
was
aware
of
this
comptroller
general
interpretation
and
that
it
did
adopt
this
sense
in
the
same
sense
that
it
used
the
term
"official
time".
finally,
i
think
the
proposition
that
collective
bargaining
is
in
the
public
interest
is
one
with
which
we
have
no
difficulty.
this
was
a
proposition
that
was
essentially
included
in
the
executive
order
program
in
some
different
words.
it
was
articulated
by
congress
in
the
1978
act,
and
i
think
it
is
a
foundation
of
the
federal
labor
management
relations
program,
but
that
general
proposition
is
not
enough
to
get
us
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
somehow
intended
to
shift
the
expenses
in
this
case
from
the
unions
where
they
had
always
been
to
the
federal
agencies.
the
general
proposition
is
simply
not
translated
into
an
entitlement
to
federal
reimbursement
of
the
expenses
here.
thank
you.
