unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
in
7131(a)
where
the
statute
says
that
the
employee
representative,
exclusive
representative,
shall
be
authorized
official
time
for
such
purposes,
does
that
mean
anything
more
than
that
his
federal
salary
will
be
paid
during
those
and
he
will
not
have
to
take
leave?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
travel
time?
unknown
speaker
did
it
not
at
least
mean
that
you
were
on
official
business?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
were
paying
the
employee
when
he
was
on
unofficial
business?
unknown
speaker
because
why?
unknown
speaker
i
am
referring
to
the
statute
we
are
construing.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
think
congress
would
authorize
unlimited
time
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
and
pay
for
it?
unknown
speaker
did
they
say
which
one
they
had
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
so
i
suppose
they
were
paying
them
either
because
they
considered
it
official
business
or
because
they
thought
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
subsidize
collective
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
is
he
the
final
interpreter
of
congressional
intent?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
rationale
for
paying
the
salary?
unknown
speaker
did
the
comptroller
general
say
what
it
was?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was...
they
surely
must
have
been
concerned
with
making
collective
bargaining
work.
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
the
federal
government
is
doing
something
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining
representatives
that
industry
does
not
do,
or
does
industry
do
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
even
by
paying
salaries?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
government
does
subsidize
the
process
to
an
extent
that
private
industry
does
not.
unknown
speaker
by
using
that
word
"official
time"?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
if
one
draws
an
analogy
to
the
labor
relations
board
in
the
private
sector,
we
habitually
give
a
great
deal
of
deference
to
the
agency
that
administers
the
statute.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
the
degree
of
deference
that
should
be
paid
to
this
agency
or
what
our
standard
of
review
is.
do
we
just
approach
it
as
a
brand
new
question
of
statutory
construction,
or
do
we
attach
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
this
agency
was
created
by
congress
and
perhaps
was
authorized
to
make
decisions
of
this
kind?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
were
persuaded
that
the
congress
just
never
thought
of
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
will
it
not
always
be
true
that
in
the
labor
disputes
that
this
agency
has
jurisdiction
that
there
will
always
be
a
potential
for
imposing
costs
on
the
sovereign
and,
therefore,
every
time
it
rules
against
the
government
they
are
not
entitled
to
deference?
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
you
have
given
me
the
reasons
why
they
should
get
less
deference
than
agencies
often
get.
what
is
the
degree
of
deference
that
you
think
this
agency
is
entitled
to
with
respect
to
this
issue
if
we
conclude
that
congress
did
not
think
of
this
particular
problem?
are
they
entitled
to
any
deference
at
all?
unknown
speaker
put
your
answer
to
my
question
really
is
they
are
not
entitled
to
any
deference?
unknown
speaker
but
in
effect
they
are
construing
a
statute
that
is
committed
to
the
comptroller
general
rather
than
to
them.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were...
you
really
said
earlier
that
you
thought
the
congress
had
really
addressed
it
in
the
sense
that
it
had
limited
the
subsidization
to
official
time
and
that
that
is
a
term
of
art.
unknown
speaker
and
as
though
it
said
and
no
more.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all.
this
is
somewhat
like
the
rule
that
if
you
are
on
the
subject
matter
and
you
include
one
and
do
not
take
the
other
then
that
is
an
inference
you
intended
to
omit
it.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that
congress
just
absentmindedly
overlooked
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
that
it
shows
that
congress
had
the
general
subject
matter
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
would
that
not
reasonably
suggest
all
the
other
problems
that
were
related
to
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
proposition
that
before
you
can
hold
the
united
states
government
responsible
of
the
payment
of
money
it
has
to
be
in
clear
and
unambiguous
language?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
say
the
petitioners.
i
said
me.
unknown
speaker
give
me
one
statute
that
says
official
time
which
includes
travel
time.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
not
need
one?
unknown
speaker
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
you
go
to
a
meeting
in
paris
you
could
charge
the
government
with
the
concorde
rates?
unknown
speaker
but
is
your
sole
reliance
not
on
the
language
"official
time"?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
official
business
and
hence
subject
to
reimbursement
for
travel
expenses.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
they
had
not...
suppose
they
had
decided
not
to
subsidize
collective
bargaining
at
all.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
then
be
here
making
a
claim
would
you?
unknown
speaker
except
for
the
official
time
and
the
payment
of
wages
while
you
are
bargaining
you
would
not
be
here.
unknown
speaker
so
is
there
any
historical
support
in
the
executive
orders
or
practice
in
the
government
for
suggesting
that
official
time
includes
travel?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
far
cry
from
saying...
witnesses
is
one
thing,
but
representing
an
organization
as
its
bargaining
representative
is
another.
is
that
all
you
have
got
for
the
past
practice?
unknown
speaker
how
did
he
modify
it?
unknown
speaker
how
did
he
modify
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
the
past
where
travel
expenses
have
actually
been
paid
for
the
time
spent
negotiating
or
to
go
and
come
from
negotiating
sessions?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
practice
since?
unknown
speaker
has
anybody
actually
paid
the
expenses
up
to
date?
unknown
speaker
who
promulgated
those
regulation
ms.
peters?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
flra
and
opm?
unknown
speaker
if
you
analogize
that
to
state
workmen's
compensation
laws,
certainly
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
have
been
extended
to
situations
where
they
will
find
something
arose
out
of
and
in
the
course
of
employment
that
it
is
inconceivable
the
employee
would
have
been
paid
for
if
he
had
been
demanding
pay.
unknown
speaker
i
am
suggesting
your
last
example
proves
very
little.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
they
are
construing
the
authority
of
another
agency,
the
authority
conferred
by
congress
on
a
different
agency.
unknown
speaker
but
the
underlying
proposition
is
that
it
is
the
business
of
the
agency.
the
central
business
of
the
agency
is
what
is
covered
by
the
gsa
provision.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
a
judge
is
assigned
from
one
district
to
another
he
is
authorized
to
have
his
expenses
paid
and
his
per
diem,
but
there
he
is
engaged
or
she
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
that
agency
and
not
some
other
agency.
unknown
speaker
ms.
peters,
can
i
ask
a
question
at
this
point?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
to
the
standard
of
the
review
problem
and
the
method
of
review.
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
issue
arose
such
as
justice
marshall
asked
you
about
that
whether
the
employee
was
entitled
to
take
first
class
because
there
was
not
tourist
available
or
something
that
went
to
the
amount
of
the
travel
expense
reimbursement
and
there
was
a
refusal
to
pay
the
requested
amount,
could
the
employee
under
your
view
of
the
statutory
scheme
cite
that
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
ask
that
it
be
decided
by
your
authority?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
route
they
took
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
route
they
took
in
this
case.
this
arised
out
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you
you
say
the
standard
of
review
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
that
reason,
and
i
was
giving
you
a
hypothetical
with
the
issue
just
a
little
different.
they
are
coming
up
in
exactly
the
same
way.
would
you
say
there
the
standard
of
review
would
also
be
arbitrary
and
capricious?
unknown
speaker
the
question
of
whether
they
could
have
ridden
first
class
instead
of
tourist?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
if
your
authority
thought
that
the
comptroller
general's
people
were
being
much
too
strict
i
would
suppose
under
your
view
you
would
have
the
right
to
say
yes
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
we
are
not
getting
the
right
amount
of
money.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
had
here...
i
know
we
do
not,
but
what
if
we
had
here
a
regulation
by
the
comptroller
general
labeled
travel
regulation
and
it
said
just
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying
here
that
union
negotiating
sessions
do
not
support
a
travel
expense
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
the
case
would
be
different
if
they
had
such
a
regulation.
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
we
knew
that
the
comptroller
general
in
some
written
formal
document
had
adopted
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case,
would
it
be
a
different
law
suit?
unknown
speaker
ms.
peters,
this
is
irrelevant,
but
i
am
curious.
does
the
record
indicate
how
much
as
a
practical
matter
we
are
talking
about
in
dollars?
unknown
speaker
in
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
in
this
issue
generally.
unknown
speaker
no
hard
evidence.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
lot
of
speeches
cited
to
us.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
lot
of
speeches
cited
to
us.
unknown
speaker
have
you
got
any
commentators
in
this
case?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
i
could
follow
justice
blackmun's
question
one
step
further,
if
we
agree
with
you
is
there
any
way
we
can
prevent
all
of
the
meeting
being
held
in
hawaii,
nevada,
puerto
rico,
et
cetra?
unknown
speaker
they
will
deduct
theirs
from
the
income
tax.
it
will
not
hurt
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
have
you
said
as
much
as
you
are
going
to
say,
ms.
peters,
about
why
this
is
justifiably
different
than
private
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
look
at
that
two
different
ways
i
think.
you
can
look
at
the
public
sector
bargaining
as
the
government,
the
employer
representing
the
public
but
the
employees
are
representing
an
adverse
faction
just
as
they
would
represent
an
adverse
faction
in
private
sector
bargaining.
the
fact
that
all
are
government
employees
in
a
technical
sense
i
do
not
think
really
makes
it
irrefutable,
the
other
position.
unknown
speaker
why
does
narrow
versus
broad
bargaining
suggest
that
your
conclusion
rather
than
the
opposite
one
should
be
reached?
unknown
speaker
that
shows
why
it
may
be
different
but
why
does
it
show
that
it
is
more
likely
that
the
official
time
should
be
construed
to
include
what
you
contend
it
is
here
as
opposed
to
the
private
sector?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
concede
then
i
take
it
the
private
sector
bargaining
unless
they
cover
it
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
the
union
representative
would
not
be
paid.
here
your
group
of
federal
employees
could
bargain
for
this
payment
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
wage
payment
or
the
payment
for
the
official
time
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
official
business
does
it?
unknown
speaker
whether
it
is
official
business
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
employees.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
employee?
unknown
speaker
ms.
corwin,
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
in
a
way
this
law
suit
is
kind
of
a
strange
case
because
it
is
a
fight
within
the
family.
they
are
different
government
agencies
disagreeing
with
one
another.
as
i
understand
your
opponent
she
seems
to
say
if
the
comptroller
general
had
ruled
unequivocally
on
this
issue
that
may
well
change
the
result.
i
wonder
why
it
had
to
reach
us
and
it
could
not
have
been
resolved
at
some
sort
of
a
level
like
that.
unknown
speaker
his
time
is
less
valuable
than
ours
i
guess.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
agencies
are
not
bound
by
the
comptroller
general.
they
are
bound
by
the
rulings
of
this
court.
is
that
not
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
does
not
bind
the
individual
employee.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
