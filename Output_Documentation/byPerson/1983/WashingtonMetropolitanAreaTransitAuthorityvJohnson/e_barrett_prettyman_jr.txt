mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
three
sentences
in
the
longshoremen's
act
which
at
the
time
of
the
injuries
in
this
case
was
the
governing
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
for
workers
compensation.
these
three
sentences
appear
in
sections
904(a)
and
905(a)
of
the
act.
wmata
is
and
has
been
for
many
years
in
overall
charge
of
building
the
metro
system
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
it
has
been
doing
so
pursuant
to
an
interstate
compact
between
the
jurisdictions
of
the
district
of
columbia,
maryland,
and
virginia.
the
compact
directs
wmata,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
authority,
to
construct
the
system,
and
wmata
as
the
general
contractor
subcontracts
the
construction
out
to
hundreds
of
subcontractors
and
thousands
of
sub-subcontractors
at
various
tiers.
prior
to
1979,
each
sub
at
whatever
tier
purchased
its
own
workers
compensation,
and
this
simply
proved
to
be
unworkable.
the
small
and
minority
contracts
have
trouble
getting
insurance
and
competing
for
the
bids.
wmata
was
never
really
certain
whether
they
had
secured
or
not,
or
whether
they
were
maintaining
their
insurance,
and
since
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
make
certain
that
all
employees
are
covered
at
all
times,
wmata
in
1971
introduced
the
cip,
the
coordinated
insurance
program,
or
what
we
call
wrap-up.
and
this
is
a
single
policy
for
comp,
for
general
liability,
for
workers'
liability,
covering
every
employee
at
every
tier
in
the
entire
system.
wmata
did
this
by
being
named
itself
in
the
policy,
and
then
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
employees
are
covered,
because
you
obviously
couldn't
name
every
employee,
by
naming
every
sub
as
the
sub
came
on
board
on
the
policy,
and
wmata
thereby
secured
under
the
act,
and
respondents,
incidentally,
do
not
deny
that
we
secured.
these
suits
were
brought
by
seven
injured
employees.
compensation
was
promptly
paid
to
them
under
the
wrap-up,
and
then
the
employees
brought
these
tort
suits.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
the
wrap-up
itself
is
being
used
extensively
throughout
the
united
states
in
every
large
project.
as
it
affects
the
longshoremen,
your
honor,
it
is
rather
limited,
in
the
sense
that
there
are
other
statutes
that
incorporate
the
longshoremen's
act,
the
defense
base
act,
and
other
statutes,
but
it
does
not
apply,
and
also,
of
course--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--correct,
your
honor,
and
it
also,
of
course,
would
apply
in
a
limited
sense
in
the
maritime
situation.
it
would
not
apply
in
your
traditional
vessel
owner,
stevedoring,
longshoremen
situation,
but
it
would
where
different
things
such
as
crane
operations
and
so
forth
were
subcontracted
out.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
that
is
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
all
five
district--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
results
in
lower
administrative
costs,
but
the
premiums,
of
course,
are
quite
high.
we
paid
out
$177
million
in
this
project
in
workers
comp
premiums.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
it
is
substantially
less.
certainly
cost
is
a
factor
here,
but
i
have
got
to
emphasize
that
the
real
force
behind
wrap-up
is
several
things.
first
of
all,
to
impose
your
safety
program
on
the
entire
project
from
the
top,
and
secondly,
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
you
are
carrying
out
your
duty
to
have
this
comp
secured
at
all
times,
because
when
you
have
got
subcontractors
coming
aboard,
leaving,
some
of
them
may
or
may
not
have
insurance.
they
have
it.
maybe
it
lapses,
and
so
forth.
monitoring
that
situation
becomes
impossible
as
a
practical
matter.
wrap-up,
we
have
found
since
'71
is
simply
the
only
practical
way
of
doing
this.
all
five
district
court
judges
in
these
seven
cases
held
that
wmata
was
a
general
contractor,
that
since
the
subs
had
not
secured,
that
wmata
fulfilled
its
statutory
duty
in
securing
with
this
policy,
that
all
of
the
employees
had
received
compensation
under
the
policy,
and
therefore
wmata
was
entitled
to
immunity
from
tort
suit
under
section
905(a).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
as
a
contractor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
i
will
get
to
that
specific
language,
but
of
course,
as
you
know,
the
statute--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
let
me
make
it
clear.
it
gets
the
immunity
as
a
statutory
employer,
and
it
gets
it
because
it
had
a
duty
as
a
contractor
to
go
out
and
secure,
in
view
of
the
fact
under
section
905(a)
that
the
employer
was
a...
the
direct
employer
was
a
subcontractor.
then--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
subs
can
do
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--oh,
well,
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
here
unless
the
court
were
to
hold...
it
would
be
rather
unusual
under
the
circumstances
here...
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
we
were
merely
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
subs
and
that
they
really
secured
and
we
didn't.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
i
think
we
are
fulfilling
our
duty
under
the
statute
to
secure.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
look
at
how
this
statute
is
arranged,
your
honor.
this
is--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it
depends
on
who
you
mean
by
the
sub.
if
you
are
talking
about
his
immediate...
his
immediate
employer?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
the
immediate
employer.
we
say
that
perhaps
he
can
sue
the
sub
for
tort,
your
honor.
now,
you
get
into
there
professor
larson
pointing
out
that
the
modern
trend
is
to
allow
immunity
all
up
the
line,
so
you
may
say
that
everybody
is
immune.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
bechtel
was
our
agent
under
section
80
of
the
compact.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
but
they
are
not
the
employer,
your
honor.
they
are
not
the
immediate
employer.
the
immediate
employer
were
various
subs
down
the
line,
and
instead
of
suing--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--unless
you
adopt
the
modern
theory
that
everybody
gets
immunity.
that
is
the
modern
trend,
as
pointed
out
by
professor
larson
in
his
treatise.
but
if
you
don't
do
that,
then
what
we
say
is
this.
you
look
to
who
has
the
duty.
as
soon
as
you
get
into
the
second
sentence
of
section
904,
and
you
have
a...
let
me
just
read
that
to
you,
because
i
think
it
is
quite
important.
"in
the
case
of
an
employer
who
is
a
subcontractor.
"
and
that
is
what
we
have
here,
"the
contractor
shall
be
liable
for.
"
not
the
sub
any
longer,
but
"the
contractor
shall
be
liable
for
and
shall
secure
the
payment
of
such
compensation.
"
and
that
is
what
we
did.
that
is
our
situation.
now,
when
we
do
that,
then
it
may
be
that
you
will
eventually
hold
in
the
next
case,
not
this
one,
that
the
sub
may
nevertheless
have
immunity
because
it
was
contingently
liable
in
the
event
that
we
failed
to
secure,
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
get
immunity
under
section
905(a)
because
we
fulfilled
the
duty
that
we
had
at
that
point.
"the
contractor
shall
be
liable
for
and
shall
secure.
"
that
is
us.
that
is
wmata.
and
that
is
what
we
got
when
we
got
this--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
as
i
say,
it
may
be
in
the
next
case
that
they
are
liable,
but
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
the
modern
trend
in
this
is
to
say
that
as
soon
as
somebody
secures
at
any
tier,
at
any
point,
as
soon
as
somebody
secures,
everyone
up
the
line
should
be
immune
from
tort
suit
thereafter
because
they
are
potentially
liable
in
the
even
of
the
circumstance--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
issue
has
not
been
decided--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--and
it
doesn't
have
to
he
decided
in
this
case.
all
you
have
to
decide
in
this
case
is,
did
we
have
a
duty,
and
did
we
fulfill
it
and
thereby
do
we
get
the
immunity--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
because
he
was
potentially
liable
in
the
case
that
something
happens
to
our
insurance.
there
is
a
concomitant
duty
here,
your
honor.
the
employer--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
absolutely
not.
and
in
this
case
it
is
just
clear
as
can
be
that
we
did
what
we
were
supposed
to
do,
and
that
we
should
therefore
get
the
immunity
for
doing
it.
that
is
the
quid
pro--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--again,
that
is
the
next
case
where
you
may
eventually
hold--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i
think
myself
unless
you
adopt
the
modern
view
that
we
should
be
liable,
absolutely,
they
should
be
able
to
sue
us
in
tort
if
you
do
not
adopt
the
modern
view
in
the
next
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
it
is
wide
open,
your
honor,--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--because
this
hasn't
been
interpreted
before.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
i
think
the
statute
does
permit
it.
the
statute
says
that
under
section
905(a),
and
let
me
turn
to
that,
because
i
think
quite
clearly
here
the
real
issue
comes
down
to
whether
we
are
a
statutory
employer
protected
by
section
905(a),
and
as
you
know,
section
905(a)
says
the
liability
of
an
employer
prescribed
in
section
904(a)
of
this
act
shall
be
exclusive.
now,
does
that
apply
to
us?
that
is
the
issue.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
under
this
statute
and
this
statute
that
you
are
interpreting,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
for
us
not
to
be
a
statutory
employer,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
if
we
are
not
a
statutory
employer,
it
means
that
we
do
not
even
have
to
pay
out
what
we
have
secured,
because
under
sections
907
to
9
and
914,
paying
out,
that
only
relates
to
an
employer.
it
means
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
notify
the
labor
department
when
we
made
our
first
payment
under
this
comp
policy
because
it
says
only
the
employer
does
that.
it
would
mean
that
the
contractor
couldn't
be
sued
for
comp
by
the
employee.
so
we
have
got
this
policy
out
there
and
they
couldn't
even
sue
us,
because
the
statute
says
that
only
an
employer
can
be
sued
by
the
employee.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right,
a
volunteer,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
your
honor.
and
of
course
we
are
not.
we
had
a
duty
and
we
fulfilled
it
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
your
honor,
the
lower
price
that
is
submitted
in
the
bids
by
the
subs
is
applicable
to
everybody,
everybody
who
comes
along.
they
don't
get
a
better
position
vis-a-vis
each
other.
they
have
to
outbid
each
other
without
counting
the
cost
of
the
insurance
in
the
bid,
but
they
can,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
happened
about
a
month
ago.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
to
be
very
honest,
your
honor,
i
think
the
cost
of
this
premium
is
being
paid
by
the
public,
because
what
happens
is,
while
the
bids
are
lower,
the
general
contractor,
wmata,
is
paying
these
tremendous
$177
million
out
in
premiums,
and
that
in
turn
is
being
paid
by
the
taxpayers.
i
don't
really
see
that
the
subs
get
any
quid
pro
quo
benefit
out
of
that,
because
they
are
all
competing
on
an
equal
basis.
proceeding
now,
as
i
say,
the
statute
would
make
absolutely
no
sense
at
all,
because
the
contractor
couldn't
be
sued
in
tort
and
have
all
its
defenses,
and
no
one,
if
no
one
secured
at
all...
let's
take
the
situation
that
was
just
posed
to
me,
where
no
one
secured.
we
couldn't
even
be
sued
by
either
the
government
under
the
criminal
sections
or
civilly
because
we
hadn't
secured,
because
that
relates
only
to
the
employer.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
thing
that
makes
any
sense
under
this
statute
at
all
is
for
us
to
be
deemed
the
statutory
employer
under
section
905(a).
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
fact
that
they
claim
here
that
we
are
really
an
owner
and
not
a
general
contractor.
i
think
i
can
pass
very
quickly
over
that,
because
all
of
the
courts
below,
including
the
court
of
appeals,
said
that
we
were
a
general
contractor.
if
we
were
not,
i
don't
know
who
would
be,
because
we
are
the
only
one
in
overall
charge
of
this
project.
we
are
the
ones
who
have
let
all
of
the
bids
out
and
approve
everybody.
we
supervise.
we
control.
we
monitor.
and
i
might
say
that
if
we
were
the
owner,
we
would
be
very
happy
about
it,
because
then
we
wouldn't
have
any
responsibility
under
this
act
at
all--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
can
be
both
an
owner
and
a
contractor,
but
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
respondents
were
specifically
asked
that
question
by
the
court
of
appeals,
are
you
suing
them
as
an
owner,
and
they
said
no.
most
importantly,
if
we
are
not
an
owner,
we
don't
have
to
secure,
we
don't
have
to
pay,
we
don't
have
to
do
anything.
we
are
totally
out
of
the
compensation
picture.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
if
we
are
not
a
contractor
and
we
are
an
owner.
did
i
misspeak
myself?
excuse
me.
so,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
we
are
a
contractor
and
covered
here.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
it
simply
makes
no
sense,
the
court
of
appeals
formulation
in
this
case,
because
it
not
only
contradicts
the
act,
but
it
is
really
totally
unworkable
what
they
suggest.
and
as
for
respondent's
suggestion,
well,
why
don't
you
go
out
and
get
a
letter
from
everybody
saying
they
have
secured,
we
have
355
subs
and
2,765
sub-subcontractors
in
this
case.
it
would
be
totally
unworkable.
and
we
wouldn't
know
from
one
day
to
the
next
whether
anybody
still
maintained
their
insurance.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
unless
you
adopt
the
modern
view.
i
hate
to
keep
throwing
that
in,
but
the
next
case,
you
may
say
everybody
gets
immunity,
but
if
you
do
not
do
that,
then
we
would
be
the
third
party,
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
because
they
can
come
in
at
any
time.
i
was
about
to
say
a
few
minutes
ago--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--but
it
is
important
that
the
sub
is
free
to
come
in
at
any
time
and
get
its
own
insurance,
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
this
happened
about
a
month
ago.
a
sub
said,
never
mind
your
wrap-up.
we
are
going
to
go
out
and
get
our
own.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
the
statute
says
unless
the
subcontractor
has
secured.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
my
argument
is--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--let's
take
it
from
the
beginning.
let's
start
on
day
one.
on
day
one
of
the
project,
we
both
have
a
duty
to
secure.
if
wmata
goes
and
gets
it
pursuant
to
the
second
sentence,
because
this
is
an
employer
who
is
a
subcontractor,
the
contractor
has
the
duty.
we
go
and
secure.
but
then
it
says,
unless
the
subcontractor
has
secured,
because
obviously
there
is
no
point
in
having
two
insurance
programs
in
place
at
the
same
time
for
one
injury.
now,
that
means
that
at
any
point
that
the
subcontractor
wants
for
any
reason
to
go
out
and
get
his
own
insurance,
he
can
do
it.
as
to
his
employee,
he
then
in
turn
relieves
us
of
our
duty
under
the
statute.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
maybe
i
misspoke
myself.
it
doesn't
have
a
continuing
duty
to
secure.
we
have
relieved
it
of
its
duty
to
secure,
but
we
have
not
preempted
it.
we
have
not
cut
it
off
from
securing.
it
can
secure
if
it
wishes
to,
but
it
has
no
duty
whatever
to
secure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
as
i
say,
it
happened
recently.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
they
can.
exactly.
and
if
you
look
at
page
104
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
see
where
we
tell
them
that,
that
they
can
go
out
and
get
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
up
until
march
8th
they
had
secured,
and
at
that
point
the
sub
comes
in,
and
the
caveat
that
justice
stevens
pointed
out
comes
into
effect
and
says,
unless
the
sub
has
secured.
at
that
point
the
sub
comes
in
and
secures,
and
in
turn
relieves
wmata
of
its
duty.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
that
is
the
beauty
of
the
wrap-up,
because
the
wrap-up
says
you
don't
have
to
secure,
we
are
covering
you--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--of
course
not.
it
can
go
get
it.
we
have
that
right
now
and--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
so
far
as
that
sub's
employee
is
concerned,
in
effect,
we
have
both
secured,
but
it
has
relieved
us
of
our
duty
to
secure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
is
possible.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
told
them
in
the
insurance
specifications--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--absolutely.
we
told
them
in
the
insurance
specifications
that
they
can
go
out
at
any
time
and
get
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
see
no
reason
to
do
it
here.
the
only
question
you
have
to
answer
here
is,
did
we
have
a
duty,
and
if
we
did,
did
we
fulfill
it,
and
if
we
did,
do
we
get
immunity
under
905.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
none
of
them
got
them
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
case
involves--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes,
you
do.
the
lower
courts
all
held
that
the
subs
did
not
secure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
none
of
them.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
involved
in
this
case.
absolutely.
this
case
is
no
one
secured
except
us.
we
secured.
now,
as
i
point
out,
they
say
that
they
secured,
they
were
secured
by
just
being
named
on
the
policy,
but
of
course
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all,
because
by
just...
the
only
reason
we
named
them
on
the
policy
was
so
we
would
know
who
their
employees
were,
and
if
they
suddenly...
they
have
no
control
over
the
policy
whatever,
including
whether
they
themselves
are
taken
on
and
off.
it
hardly
makes
sense
to
say
that
they
secured
under
the
policy
just
by
being
named.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
they
do.
they
can
go
out
and
get
it
on
their
own.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
on
this,
they
do
not
have
to
pay...
the
way
i
would
put
it
is,
they
are
not
forced
to
pay
the
premium
on
this
policy.
let
me
just--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
932,
your
honor,
defines
securing,
and
it
defines
it
either
as
being
a
self-insurer
or
as
getting
and
maintaining
insurance.
let
me
just
touch
briefly
on
one
last
point
here,
and
that
is
the
new
york
statute,
because
everybody
agrees
the
legislative
history
is
silent
on
what
904
and
905(a)
as
it
affects
us
here,
and
so
they
come
back
to
the
legislative
history
of...
not
the
legislative
history,
but
they
come
back
to
the
new
york
statute.
let
me
just
say
very
briefly
the
new
york...
this
court
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
address
this
before,
incidentally.
you
have
always
said
the
longshoremen's
act
is
patterned
after
the
new
york
act.
this
is
the
one
case
where
it
isn't.
there
is
an
extraordinarily
important
material
difference
between
the
new
york
act
and
longshoremen's.
in
the
new
york
statute
you
had
only
a
duty
to
secure
and
pay,
and
two
new
york
cases
have
pointed
out
the
difference.
if
i
have
a
duty
to
secure,
i
have
to
go
out
on
day
one
before
anybody
is
injured
and
under
criminal
penalty
i
have
to
get
that
insurance
in
place,
and
i
have
to
pay
the
premiums
even
if
nobody
is
ever
injured.
under
the
new
york
act,
you
don't
have
to.
you
can
wait
until
the
first
injury
comes
along.
you
can
pay
it.
you
can
wait
until
the
next
injury
comes
along.
and
you
never
have
to
secure.
so
that...
i
will
just
leave
you
with
that
thought.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
none
whatever,
because
we
have
relieved
him
of
his
responsibility
to
secure.
we
did
our
duty
under
904(a)
and
905(a)
by
securing
ourselves,
and
as
is
shown
by
the
caveat--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely
not,
as
shown
by
the
unless
clause,
which
clearly
shows
that
they
both
don't
have
to
get
insurance
for
the
same
injury.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
just
want
to
read
one
sentence
to
you
from
respondent's
brief,
particularly
in
response
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
and
to
you,
justice
rehnquist.
after
discussing
sections
907,
8,
and
9,
respondents
say,
wmata,
"would
also
be
responsible
for
obeying
other
sections
which
relate
to
the
payment
of
those
benefits.
"
but
all
those
other
sections
just
refer
to
employer,
so
you
are
right.
they
want
us
to
be
an
employer
for
some
sections
but
not
for
section
905.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
concept
of
statutory
employer,
your
honor,
goes
way
back
in
compensation
law
and
comes
all
the
way
forward.
it
has
been
recognized--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--oh,
i
am
sorry.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i
understand.
because
what
they
wanted
to
do
was,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
each
person
on
the
tier
above
a
subcontractor
would
be
responsible
and
couldn't
get
rid
of
its
responsibility
by
just
getting
an
irresponsible
sub
and
say,
well,
i
don't
have
any--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
the
important
thing
is
not
whether
you
call
him
an
employer
or
a
statutory
employer.
the
point
is,
does
he
get
the
quid
pro
quo
that
comes
from...
that
immunity
is
built
on.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
has
to
include
wmata
in
this
case,
the
statutory
employer,
or
none
of
the
rest
of
the
statute
makes
sense,
because
the
whole
rest
of
the
statute
says
if
you
don't
secure
the
employer
you
can
sue.
the
employer
is
criminally
liable.
if
you
don't
say
that
that's
not
wmata,
wmata
has
no
obligations
here.
it
says
it
has
to
secure,
but
there
is
no
way
to
enforce
it.
thank
you.
