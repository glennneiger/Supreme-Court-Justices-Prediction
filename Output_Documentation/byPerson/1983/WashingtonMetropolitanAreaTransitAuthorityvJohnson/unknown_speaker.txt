unknown
speaker
mr.
prettyman,
does
the
same
situation
exist
outside
the
metropolitan
transit
authority
in
other
construction
contracts
in
areas
covered
by
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act?
unknown
speaker
but
this
question
would
have
application
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
washington
metropolitan
transit
authority,
i
assume,
in
other
construction
contracts
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
too
many
subcontracts
in
the
maritime
business.
unknown
speaker
does
the
use
of
the
wrap-up
insurance
result
in
lower
premiums
overall
and
lower
administrative
costs?
unknown
speaker
is
that
substantially
less
than
it
would
have
been
if
the
individual
subcontractors
were
all
buying
it
separately?
unknown
speaker
as
an
employer,
mr.
prettyman?
unknown
speaker
as
an
employer,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
yes,
as
a
contractor.
unknown
speaker
but
only
because
somebody
else
has
not...
did
not
have
their
own
insurance?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
subs
never
changed.
there
was
a
group
of
subs,
and
they
all
sat
down
with
the
general
contractor,
and
they
all
said,
well,
how
should
we
go
about
getting
our
insurance,
and
the
general
said,
well,
why
don't
i
just
buy
it
for
all
of
you,
it
will
be
cheaper
in
the
long
run,
and
the
sub
says,
well,
if
that's
the
way
you
want
it,
but
we
will
get
our
own
if
you
want.
and
so
you
buy
the
insurance
because
there
has
been
a
mutual
decision
that
the
subs
won't.
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
that
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
general
buys
it,
and
everybody
agrees
they
are
going
to
buy
it,
and
you
will
be...
you
are
the
one
who
will
pay
the...
you
will
pay
the
employees.
unknown
speaker
but
then
what
if
the
subs...
what
if
the
employee
of
the
sub
is
hurt,
and
turns
to
you
for
compensation
and
you
pay
him.
unknown
speaker
can
the
sub
then...
can
the
employee
then...
and
suppose
the
sub
was
negligent.
unknown
speaker
and
was
responsible
for
the
accident.
normally
couldn't
the
employee
sue
the
sub
as
a
third
party?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
sub
who
was
negligent.
no,
i...
yes,
the
immediate
employer.
unknown
speaker
do
you
object
to
the
dismissal
of
bechtel
here?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
were
the...
they
were
sued
as
a
third
party,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
so
could
they
sue...
you
suggest
that
perhaps
the
subs
who
were
possibly
negligent
could
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
prettyman,
you
didn't
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence.
unknown
speaker
it
says,
"unless
the
subcontractor
has
secured
such
payment.
"
now,
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
the
subcontractor
has
not
secured
the
payment?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it
is
your
position
that
the
subcontractor
is
liable?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
the
modern
trend
in
legislation
or
something,
but
it
doesn't
hardly
square
with
the
longshoremen's
act,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
have
a
duty
and
you
have
fulfilled
it,
the
sub,
the
actual
employer,
didn't
have
a
duty,
and
didn't
fulfill
it,
and
why
should
he
have
immunity
under
the
longshoremen's
act?
unknown
speaker
nothing
happened
to
your
insurance.
unknown
speaker
nothing
happened
to
your
insurance.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
prettyman,
what
if
the
subcontractor
got
the
insurance,
and
the
general
contractor
didn't?
do
you
think
the
general
contractor
should
have
immunity
in
that
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
are
we
free
to,
as
you
say,
adopt
the
modern
view?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
if
the
statute
doesn't
permit
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
just
a
gratuitous
interloper.
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
a
gratuitous
interloper.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
regardless
of
whose
name
is
on
the
policy,
the
cost
of
the
premium
in
one
way
or
another
is
being
shared
by
both
the
general
contractor
and
the
sub,
either
in
the
form
of
a
lower
bid
by
the
sub
if
the
general
contractor
gets
it
or
vice
versa.
unknown
speaker
the
point
is
just
that
i
think
you
might
find
that
the
cost
of
the
premium
is
economically
being
shared
by
both
the
subcontractor
and
the
general
contractor.
unknown
speaker
can't
you
be
both?
unknown
speaker
can't
you
be
both?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
you
are
not
a
what,
a
contractor?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
about
this
army
of
subs
and
sub-subs
and
all,
supposing
some
of
them
in
ignorance
or
whatever
it
might
be
had
gone
out
and
bought
their
own
insurance.
they
had
a
very
conservative
lawyer
who
said,
i
don't
care
what
the
metropolitan
area
transit
authority
did,
you
get
your
own
insurance,
and
they
got
it.
and
they
did
it
before
they
signed
their
contract
with
you
to
have
some
kind
of
overall
coverage.
would
they
then
have
secured
the
payment
within
the
meaning
of
904(a)?
unknown
speaker
and
then
as
to
them
you
would
be
secondarily
liable
in
tort
as
to
those...
i
mean,
if
they
could
identify
such
a
situation,
you
would
be
a
third
party
tort
feasor?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
one
or
the
other
is...
you
are
going
to
say
unless
we
adopt
the
modern
view,
but
you
think
the
statute
means
one
or
the
other
is
liable,
and
you,
by
buying
the
insurance
first,
prevented...
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
wait
until
they
have
had
an
opportunity
to
secure
payment
under--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
prettyman,
why
don't
you...
it
seems
to
me
you
have
already
said
that
you
as
a
general
contractor
and
your
sub
could
sit
down
and
as
part
of
your
deal
say
that
you
don't
carry
the
insurance,
i
do,
which
is
what
you
have
essentially
done.
and
even
if
a
sub
has
bought
insurance
before,
the
deal
is
that
you
are
carrying
the
insurance.
he
should
cancel
his.
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
be
free?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
a
while
ago
you
said
that
if
by
agreement
he
doesn't
get
it,
he
hasn't
gotten
it,
and
hence
you
can
get
it.
i
thought
that
was
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
it
almost
has
to
be.
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
pose
some
sort
of
a
continuing
authority
on
the
part
of
the
sub
to
secure
if
you
in
fact
have
secured
at
the
beginning?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
although
it
is
already
covered
by
your
policy--
unknown
speaker
--it
could
in
a
kind
of
fit
of
absentmindedness
get
a
policy
of
its
own?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
more
than
absentmindedness.
i
can
see
a
subcontractor
thinking
he
would
rather
have
his
own
insurance
so
that
he
isn't
going
to
be
subjected
to
third
party
suits
if
his
employees
are
injured,
so
it
would
make
some
sense
for
subcontractors
to
want
to
get
their
own.
you
are
just
saying
they
can
do
it
if
they
want
to.
unknown
speaker
if
on
march
1st
the
project
starts
with
this
sub,
and
on
that
date
the
sub
has
not
secured,
wmata
goes
out
and
secures.
now,
on
march
8th
the
sub,
following
the
advice
of
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
lawyer,
says,
even
though
you
are
already
covered
by
another
policy,
and
the
sub
goes
ahead
and
buys
another
policy,
i
take
it
wmata
has
still
secured
because
the
subcontractor
did
not
secure.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
that
something
that
can
just
change
from
day
to
day?
i
thought
this
was
kind
of...
the
sentence
was
kind
of
to
give
the
parties
a
basis
on
which
to
structure
their
relationship.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
they
did.
supposing
under
the
wrap-up
a
sub...
it
is
all
wrapped
up,
but
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
lawyer
says
to
a
particular
sub,
you
go
buy
a
policy
anyway.
now,
does
that
cut
that
sub
out
so
far
as
wmata
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
but
then
have
you
not
secured
so
far
as
that
sub
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
and
subjected
you
maybe
to
a
third
party
liability.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
terms
of
your
wrap-up
policy
recognize
this,
and
recognize
that
on
any
given
day
somebody
might
opt
in
and
then
relieve
the
wrap-up
policy
of
its
liability.
isn't
that
the
way
it
is
written?
unknown
speaker
you
tell
them
that
when
you
get
your
wrap-up
policy.
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
that
we
don't
have
to
answer
here
is
whether
immunity
is
granted
all
down
the
line
for
the
general
and
the
subs.
we
are
not
answering
it
here,
although
i
guess
we
could.
unknown
speaker
well,
really,
we
should
say
with
respect
to
the
subs
who
didn't
get
their
own
do
you
have
a
duty.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
that,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
none
of
them?
unknown
speaker
none
of
them
did.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
have
the
right
to
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
have
the
right
to
pay
the
premium,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
said
on
this
particular
policy.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
one
rather
stupid
question,
i
am
afraid?
unknown
speaker
but
the
words
"secure
the
payment
to
his
employee.
"
we
are
emphasizing
the
word
"secure".
under
this
statute,
could
a
big
employer
be
a
self-insurer?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
more
question
if
i
may.
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
the
criminal
responsibility.
is
there
any
possibility
that
a
subcontractor
here
who
did
not
secure
because
you
secured
is
subject
to
criminal
liability?
unknown
speaker
you
say
he
has
no
independent
duty
to
secure?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
employers
usually
do.
they
just
pay
the
premiums.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
mulroney,
if
the
contractor
gets
the
insurance,
why
doesn't
the
contractor
become
the
employer
for
the
purpose
of
this
and
the
other
sections?
that
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
statutory
scheme.
unknown
speaker
but
that
answer
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
in
view
of
the
dependent
clause
at
the
end,
"unless
the
subcontractor
has
secured
such
payment.
"
that
isn't
the
language
of
a
guarantor.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
that
may
be
one
of
the
purposes,
but
the
language
is,
it
seems
to
me,
quite
clear
when
it
says
the
contractor
shall
be
liable
for
and
shall
secure
the
payment
of
such
compensation
unless
the
subcontractor
has
secured
such
payment.
if
the
subcontractor
has
not
secured
such
payment,
then
surely
that
means
that
the
contractor
shall
secure
the
payment.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
the
precise
language
that
i
just
quoted
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn't
say
anything--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
secondary
coverage.
it
says
the
exact
language
that
i
read
to
you.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
a
reason,
but
i
think
you
are
just
making
mincemeat
of
the
statutory
language.
you
are
trying
to
kind
of
push
it
in
one
direction
that
to
me
the
words
just
don't
let
it
go.
suppose
there
is
a
contractor
who
has...
there
are
two
subs,
a
general
has
two
subs.
one
of
them
has
his
own
insurance,
and
the
other
one
doesn't,
and
the
contractor
knows
it.
the
statute
would
then
put
a
burden
on
the
employer
or
the
general
to
get
some
insurance
for
the
one
who
didn't.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
he
did.
suppose
he
did,
and
an
employee
of
that
sub
who
didn't
have
insurance
is
hurt.
and
the
employer
then
pays
the
benefits.
is
that
his
exclusive
liability
then?
is
he
subject
to
any
kind
of
a
tort
suit?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
has
secured
the
insurance
and
paid
out
the
benefits?
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
sub
is
immune.
somebody
is
immune.
unknown
speaker
so
both
are
subject
to
tort
suit
then.
unknown
speaker
both
the
sub
and
the
general.
unknown
speaker
so
the
employer,
because
he
wasn't...
the
general...
you
go
ahead
if
you
think
you
are
wasting
your
time.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
think
nobody
gets
immunity?
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
incredible
proposition.
i
mean,
i
cannot
believe
that
you
are
asserting
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
employee
ultimately
recovers
under
the
general
contractor's
policy,
why
shouldn't
the
general
contractor
have
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
back
to
that
same
fruitless
inquiry,
i
guess,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
taking
the
position
that
the
general
contractor,
if
the
subcontractor
doesn't
provide
insurance,
has
the
legal
responsibility
to
provide
the
compensation
to
the
injured
worker,
and
becomes
liable
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
sections
907,
908,
and
909.
they
all
speak
in
terms
of
an
employer,
and
yet
we
are
invoking
those
sections
against
the
general
contractor,
so
you
are
in
effect
saying
the
general
is
an
employer
under
some
sections
but
not
under
905.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
out
of
this
other
than
for
both
of
them
to
take
out
insurance?
unknown
speaker
under
your
plan?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
is
there
any
way
out
other
than
that?
unknown
speaker
they've
got
to
take
out--
unknown
speaker
--well,
is
the
injured
employee
going
to
collect
from
both?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
employer
insured?
unknown
speaker
and
normally
that
would
be
it,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
one
has
the
same
insurance,
doesn't
he?
doesn't
the
policy
include
the
contractor,
too?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
only
one
i
am
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
coordinated
insurance
plan.
isn't
the
contractor
a
party
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
the
employer
pay
the
bill?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
the
bill?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
the
contractor
pays,
right?
who
puts
the
money
out?
the
contractor.
unknown
speaker
who
puts
the
money
out
for
the
policy?
the
contractor.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry.
the
more
i
get
from
you,
the
more
confused
i
get.
unknown
speaker
there
is
also
another
reason,
to
make
sure
everybody
is
covered
at
all
times.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
my
statement
incorrect
that
it
assures
that
everybody
is
covered?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you...
i
have
to
get
back
to
kind
of
elementary
stuff...
is
there
a
definition
of
the
word
"employer"
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
is
no,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
what
statutory
section
defines
employer?
unknown
speaker
because
nobody
seemed
to
quote
the
definition,
but
it
is
beginning
to
sink
through
to
me
that
perhaps
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
word
905(a)
includes
someone
who
pays
the
insurance
or
just
someone
who
hires
the
people.
i
mean,
is
there
really
something...
your
opponent
talks
about
a
statutory
employer,
and
is
there
such
an
animal?
i
guess
that's...
can
we
say
that
is
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
are
saying
that
the
general
contractor,
simply
because
he
buys
the
insurance,
he
doesn't
become
an
employer--
unknown
speaker
--a
statutory
employer--
unknown
speaker
--or
any
other
kind
of
employer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulroney,
there
is
a
federal
regulation
that
defines
employer,
isn't
there,
70.1301(a)(13).
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
and
it
basically
defines
employer
as
the
person
obligated
to
pay
and
secure
compensation
as
provided
in
the
act,
and
under
that
definition,
it
certainly
is
reasonable
to
say
that
the
contractor
is
an
employer.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
secure
workmen's
compensation
for
employees,
it
seems
to
me
the
act's
purpose
is
served
by
the
wrap-up
policy.
unknown
speaker
are
you
opposed
to
workmens
compensation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mulroney,
is
this
your
position,
that
section
905
is
the
exclusivity
provision
that
confers
immunity.
it
talks
about
the
liability
of
an
employer
proscribed
in
section
904
of
this
title
shall
be
exclusive.
you
say
in
effect
your
opponents
are
claiming
that
because
section
904
requires
the
contractor
in
some
circumstances
to
secure
the
payment,
that
the
contractor
thereby
becomes
an
employer
under
section
904,
but
you
say
that
is
not
the
way
to
read
section
904.
is
that
a
fair
summary
of
your--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
mulroney,
i
would
find
it
extremely
helpful...
i
am
trying
to
understand
your...
if
you
could
answer
questions
instead
of
simply
going
into
your
own
line
of
thought,
but
apparently
you
are
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sorry,
too.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
get
into
this
a
little
bit.
you
are
contending,
are
you
not,
that
the
general
contractor
is
not
an
employer.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
he
is
not
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
905(a).
unknown
speaker
and
904
deals
with
paying
of
premiums
and
getting
insurance,
doesn't
deal
with
the
immunity.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
whole
case,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
i
asked
you
if
there
was
a
definition
of
employer,
and
you
gave
me
an
answer,
but
i
don't
know
exactly
where
i
am
going
to
find
it,
still,
because
that
would
be
helpful
to
me,
because
as
i
understand
the
case,
the
case
turns
on
what
the
word
905(a).
unknown
speaker
does
the
insurance
contract
identify
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
is
employer
defined
or
identified?
are
the
employers
identified
in
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
is
there--
unknown
speaker
--is
metro
named
in
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
is
it
ever
listed
as
an
employer?
unknown
speaker
is
it
ever
listed
as
a
contractor?
as
a
contractor?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
the
premiums?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
named,
but
not
characterized
as
to
what
its
status
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
prettyman,
i
do
have
a
question.
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
second
sentence
of
section
904
make
a
contractor
who
pays
insurance
premiums
or
who
secures
compensation
an
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
does
the
second
sentence
make
the
contractor
who
secures
payment
an
employer
for
purposes
of
905?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
depends
on
language
of
section
905,
and
all
it
says
there
is
an
employer.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
