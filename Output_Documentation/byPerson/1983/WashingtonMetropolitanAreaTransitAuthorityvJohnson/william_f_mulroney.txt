mr.
william
f.
mulroney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
metro
should
be
given
immunity
from
third
party
suits
by
these
respondents
despite
the
plain
language
of
section
905(a)
granting
immunity
only
to
employers,
and
despite
the
plain
language
of
section
933(a),
preserving
the
injured
employee's
right
to
proceed
against
any
person
other
than
the
employer.
the
issue
is
not,
as
metro
states,
whether
metro
must
be
responsible
for
both
damages
in
tort
and
for
workers
compensation
benefits
to
the
respondents.
the
compensation
paid
to
the
respondents
in
these
cases
were
paid
by
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
on
behalf
of
and
in
the
name
of
the
employers
who
are
insured
entities
under
the
policy.
metro
merely
voluntarily
paid
the
premium
for
these
coverages
in
order
to
save
millions
of
dollars.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that
is
what
employers
normally
do.
the
statute
normally,
under
the
traditional
scheme,
an
employer
pays
his
own
premium.
that
hasn't
happened
here.
metro
has
provided
the
coverages
for
the
employers,
and
has
informed
them
under
the
coordinated
insurance
program
not
to
submit
bids
that
do
not
take
into
account
the
coordinated
insurance
program's
coverages.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
means
that
any
contractor
who
has
been
awarded
a
contract
under
phase
2
has
not
submitted
the
cost
of
workers
compensation
in
his
bid.
he
can't,
because
metro
decides
who
is
going
to
get
the
contract,
and
it
usually
awards
the
contract
to
the
low
bidder,
so
that
when
the
contract
is
awarded,
metro
assures
itself
that
the
contractor
who
is
given
the
contract
has
not
secured
his
own
workers
compensation
insurance.
now,
before
i
go
forward,
i
would
want
to
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear,
and
that
is
that
it
is
very
much
in
issue,
and
the
respondents
deny
that
metro
has
secured
compensation
pursuant
to
its
904(a)
duty,
and
that
is
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
it
is
that
the
employer
has
the
primary
obligation
to
secure
benefits.
if
the
employers
herein,
the
respondents
employers,
have
not
secured
compensation,
and
if
the
coordinated
insurance
program
in
fact
prevents
them
from
securing
compensation,
there
is
something
basically
flawed
about
the
program
itself.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
your
honor,
because
the
statute
does
not
make
them
an
employer.
a
contractor's
duty,
if
you
understand
the
second
sentence
of
section
904(a),
imposes
the
duties
of
a
guarantor.
it
is
the
practical
equivalent
of
section
56
of
the
new
york
act.
it
imposes
on
the
contractor
a
secondary
obligation
to
secure
the
compensation
in
the
event
that
the
employer
he
hires
is
uninsured.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
your
honor,
that
is
because
it
is
the
primary
obligation
of
every
employer
to
secure
compensation
under
this
act.
that
includes
subcontractors.
the
second
sentence
of
904(a)
is
what
they
call
a
contractor
under
provision,
and
the
purpose
of
it,
if
you
go
back
to
the
original
new
york
'22...
1922
new
york
law,
is
to
prevent
an
unscrupulous
contractor
who
has
obtained
a
contract
for
a
given
price,
including
the
cost
of
his
compensation,
to
contract
out
work
he
would
ordinarily
due
to
uninsured
subcontractors,
thereby
saving
himself
money,
and
the
protection
afforded
by
that
provision
is
to
guarantee
that
he
hires
insured
subcontractors.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
your
honor,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
it
comes
directly
from
the
new
york
law.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
precise
language
means
that
the
contractor
is
to
secure
his
secondary
coverage.
it
all
comes--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--it
is
all
done
by
means
of
insurance.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
right.
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
first
sentence
of
section
904,
which
requires
every
employer
to
secure
the
payment
of
compensation
for
his
employees.
this
does
not
exclude
subcontractors
from
this.
the
second
sentence
of
section
904(a)
can
only
be
read
if
you
understand
that
every
employer,
including
subcontractors,
have
a
statutory
obligation
to
secure
the
payment
of
compensation.
what
the
second
sentence
is
referring
to
is
that
a
contractor
is
in
a
position
by
virtue
of
his
contractual
and
financial
position
to
hire
someone
who
is
uninsured,
and
that
puts
on
him
the
onus
to
hire
a
contractor
who
is
insured.
otherwise,
he
is
going
to
be
liable
for--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--that's
right,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--yes,
he
is,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--that's
right.
absolutely.
because
the
second--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--if
the
employer
has
not
secured
compensation
coverage,
he
is
not
immune
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
905(b).
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
one
is
subject
to
an
elective
remedy
under
905(b),
and
one
would
remain
a
third
person
because
of
the
plain
language
of
905(a)
and
933(a).
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
no,
i
am--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--understand,
your
honor,
if
you
understand
the
statute--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--your
honor,
the
general
contractor,
when
he
purchases
his
insurance
policy
to
cover
his
employees,
every
contractor
insurance
policy
automatically
covers
employees
of
subcontractors.
that
is
the
way
every
insurance
policy
in
the
country
is
written.
unless
he
provides
proof
to
his
carrier
that
the
subcontractor
he
hired
is
insured,
he
will
have
to
pay
an
additional
premium
for
the
employees
of
the
subcontractor.
if
he
does
provide
the
proof,
and
if
he
hires
a
subcontractor
who
is
insured,
then
there
is
no
additional
premium
for
the
contractor.
if
he
does
not,
then
he
is
going
to
be
assessed
a
premium
based
upon
the
payroll
of
the
subcontractor.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
has
worked
to
protect
employees
of
subcontractors.
the
contractor
must
secure
his
contingent
liability.
he
must
secure
it,
because
the
statute
uses
the
word
"secure".
the
contingent
liability
that
a
contractor
has
has
to
be
secured
pursuant
to
section
932,
and
it
is
automatic.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
because
the
statute
doesn't
give
it
to
him.
the
statute
says
quite
simply
that
the
employer
is
entitled
to
statutory
immunity
under
905(b)
and--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--your
honor,
we
are
saying
that
employer
means
employer
throughout
the
act.
the
contractor's
duty
to
secure
payment
for
compensation
to
the
injured
worker
comes
under
section
904,
and
that
statute
is
self-effective.
it
makes
the
contractor
liable
for
the
payment
in
section
907,
908,
909,
by
its
own
terms.
the
statute
presumes
compliance
with
its
terms.
every
employer
must
secure,
must
secure
compensation.
that
includes
subcontractors.
the
statute
doesn't
presume
that
subcontractors
are
going
to
be
in
default
of
their
statutory
obligations,
and
in
fact
every
subcontractor
on
the
metro
project
and
every
prime
contractor
has
presumed
that
by
participating
in
the
coordinated
insurance
plan,
and
by
becoming
a
named
insured,
they
have
secured
coverage
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
they
must.
and
the
coordinated
insurance
plan
must
succeed
in
doing
that.
the
contractor
cannot
extinguish
a
subcontractor's
duty
to
obtain
insurance
by
providing
an
overall
policy
and
saying
don't
submit
insurance
coverage.
it
doesn't
work
that
way.
the
subcontractor
must
necessarily
provide
insurance
coverage
for
his
own
employees,
and
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
supports
this
completely.
as
late
as
the
1972
amendments,
congress
indicated
specifically
it
intended
the
employer
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
insurance
premiums
in
order
to
give
him
an
incentive
to
provide
a
safe
work
place.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
no,
your
honor--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--but
that...
this
is
the
way
it
works.
basically
what
happens
is--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--no.
the
contractor's
policy--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--a
contractor's
policy--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--no,
the
injured
worker
makes
his
claim
against
the
employer.
and
he
has
made
his
claim
against
the
employer
in
all
of
these
cases,
and
the
carrier
has
responded
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
that
is
the
named
insured.
not
on
behalf
of
metro.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
employer
in
these
cases
is
insured.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
against
the
employer,
but
the
employee
retains
his
third
party
rights
of
action
against
any
person
other
than
the
employer.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
this
policy--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--for
workers
compensation,
metro
is
not
covered
under
the
principles
of
the
coordinated
insurance
plan.
with
regard
to
its
own
employees,
wmata
is
a
self-insured.
they
have
no
need
of
coverage
under
the
coordinated
insurance
plan
for
its
own
employees.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
all
the
contractors
are
a
party
to
the
coordinated
insurance
plan,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
no.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
metro
pays
the
premium
for
the
benefit
of
the
contractor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
coordinated
insurance
plan
expressly
states
that
the
policies
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
worker.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
no,
metro...
normally,
outside
of
the
context
of
wrap-up
insurance,
the
subcontractor
purchases
his
own
policy
and
the
contractor
purchases
his
own
policy.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
under
wrap-up,
metro
pays
the
premium,
but
the
policy
names
the
employer
as
the
insured.
this
is
a
plan
that
was
instituted
to
save
a
great
deal
of
money.
this
way
they
don't
have
a
great
deal...
many
insurance
companies.
there
is
no
subrogation.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
that
any
default
has
occurred
under
phase
1
of
the
metro
project.
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
was
ever
a
default.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
policy--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
under
the
district
of
columbia
extension,
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
explicitly
limited
to
the
traditional
notion
of
master
and
servant.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
answer
is
yes,
that
an
employer
is
defined
as
the
person
who
employs
and
controls
the
activities
of
the
employee.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
under
the
district
of
columbia
compensation
act,
it
is
the
actual
extension
itself
that
limits
the
definition
of
employer
to
the
person
who
employs
the
person
that
works
for
him.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
under
our
statute,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
plain
language
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
congress
intended
anybody
other
than
the
employer
to
obtain
the
immunity
in
section
905.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
right.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
if
you--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--your
honor,
the
employer
is
obligated
as
an
employer
to
secure
compensation.
a
contractor
is
never
obligated
as
an
employer.
he
is
obligated
as
a
contractor,
and
the
duties
imposed
by
the
second
sentence
of
904(a)
are
specifically
there
only
because
of
the
relationship
that
the
contractor
has
with
a
subcontractor.
the
contractor
is
in
a
position
to
hire
for
purposes
not
consistent
with
the
act
an
uninsured
subcontractor,
so
the
second
sentence
a
puts
duty
on
him
to
hire
an
insured
subcontractor
or
he
is
going
to
be
held
liable
himself.
it
does
not
entitle
the
contractor
to
any
immunity
that
he
would
otherwise
have.
all
he
has
to
do
is
hire
an
insured
subcontractor
in
order
to
protect
the
injured
employee,
and
the
statute
does
not
accord
him
any
immunity
for
that.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
plain
language
of
section
33,
or
section
905,
933(i),
which
was
amended
in
1959,
to
indicate
that
the
congress
intended
the
immunities
of
an
employer
to
extend
any
further
than
what
the
congress
called
in
1959
the
employer-employee
family,
and
that
is
very
important,
because
this
act
is
based
on
the
new
york
act;
904(a)
is
based
on
section
56
of
the
new
york
statute,
and
in
1946,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
sweezy
case
held
that
under
no
circumstances,
whether
the
contractor
has
to
pay
or
not
pay,
is
he
an
employer
entitled
to
immunity
within
the
meaning
of
the
new
york
statute.
the
fiori
case
here
under
the
longshore
act
follows
precisely
the
same
rationale
as
that.
the
contractor
is
not
entitled
to
immunity
by
virtue
of
a
secondary
obligation
he
has
pursuant
to
the
second
sentence
in
904(a).
he
is
not
entitled
to
it
because
all
the
statute
does
is
what
the
statute
does
in
937
to
a
vessel
owner.
he
has
to
hire
an
insured
contractor,
and
if
he
doesn't,
the
statute
is
going
to
hold
him
responsible.
if
he
doesn't
hire
an
insured
contractor,
it
would
reward
him.
it
would
reward
him
for
subverting
the
purposes
of
the
act
by
hiring
an
uninsured
subcontractor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
there
is
much
more
to
it
than
that,
your
honor.
the
act
also
serves
to
preserve
the
employee's
common
law
rights
of
action
which
are
not
specifically
eliminated
by
section
905(a),
and
the
only
remedies
that
the
injured
worker
has
that
are
eliminated
by
the
statute
by
its
clear
terms
are
those
that
he
had
at
common
law
against
the
employer.
now,
wrap-up
insurance
should
not
change
the
legal
liabilities
or
the
obligations
or
the
rights
between
any
of
the
parties.
if
wrap-up
insurance
satisfies
the
statute,
it
must
allow
the
employers
who
participate
in
it,
what
metro
calls
their
subcontractors,
to
secure
compensation
coverage.
by
instituting
an
insurance
plan
that
saves
them
money,
they
should
not
be
able
to
cloak
themselves
with
the
immunity
of
an
employer.
it
goes
beyond
the
plain
purpose
of
the
act
in
permitting
the
injured
worker
his
common
law
remedies
against
anybody
but
the
employer.
in
1972,
the
congress
amended
the
act
and
indicated
a
number
of
things
that
are
relevant
to
the
inquiry
here.
first,
the
congress
specifically
declined
the
opportunity
to
extend
the
immunity
of
an
employer
any
further
than
the
plain
language
indicates.
there
were
bills
passed
or
pending
in
front
of
congress
at
that
time
to
extend
the
immunity
of
an
employer
to
a
vessel,
making
the
vessel
and
the
stevedore
joint
employers.
the
rejected
that,
and
indicated
specifically
the
beneficial
purpose
of
allowing
the
injured
employee
to
proceed
against
a
third
party
at
common
law,
because
it
encouraged
safety.
another
consideration
is,
congress
indicated
it
wanted
the
vessel
owner
to
be
in
precisely
the
same
situation
as
a
third
party
would
be
in
a
land-based
setting,
indicating
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
case
law
under
the
district
of
columbia
act
allowing
the
injured
worker
the
right
to
proceed
against
the
general
contractor.
there
is
no
question
that
the
case
law
has
been
unanimous
in
allowing
suits
by
subcontractor
employees
against
the
general
contractor,
despite
the
fact
that
904(a)
imposes
a
secondary
obligation
on
the
contractor
to
secure
compensation
in
the
event
that
his
own
employer
fails
to
do
so.
in
these
cases,
metro
has
preempted
the
obligation
of
the
employers
to
secure
compensation
if
in
fact
the
metro
wrap-up
plan
does
not
satisfy
the
obligations
of
the
employer
to
secure
compensation.
the
respondents
submit
that
the
employers
have
secured
compensation
by
participating
in
this
plan.
metro
hasn't
secured
it
merely
by
purchasing
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
employers
who
are
under
a
statutory
obligation
to
secure
it
in
the
first
place.
in
fact,
there
is
an
important
reason
why
metro
should
be
denied
immunity
and
that
is
because
by
purchasing
the
premium
they
have
tended
to
undermine
safety
in
the
work
place.
congress
indicated
in
1972,
as
i
stated
earlier,
that
the
employer
should
shoulder
the
burden
of
the
premium
payment
in
order
for
him
to
have
an
interest
in
safe
conduct.
when
metro
instituted
this
program
in
1971,
precisely
the
opposite
thing
happened.
the
contractors
who
were
insured
entities
had
no
interest
in
getting
the
work
done,
and
we
are
talking
about
very
dangerous
work.
we
are
talking
about
tunneling.
we
are
talking
about
underground
mining.
and
the
contractors,
by
not
having
the
right
to
have
their
premium
reduced,
by
having
no
rebate
system,
they
lost
the
incentive,
resulting
in
higher
losses
than
what
ordinarily
have
occurred.
metro
has
indicated
that
this
is
true
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
in
june
of
1978,
to
replace
that
incentive,
they
had
to
institute
a
safety
awareness
program
which
was
a
system
of
bonuses
for
contractors
who
had
better
safety
records,
to--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
workmens
compensation
is
a
wonderful
thing.
it
is
the
employer's
burden
to
secure
it
for
his
employees,
in
return
for
which
he
obtains
a
benefit,
immunity
from
suit.
but
a
third
party
should
not
be
allowed
to
come
into
this
relationship
and
say
i
am
going
to
pay
the
premium
for
you,
but
i
am
taking
your
immunity
from
you,
because
that
upsets
the
entire
applecart.
it
interferes
with
the
statutory
scheme,
and
basically
preempts
the
employer's
duties
which
contribute
to
safety
in
the
work
place.
the
congress
was
interested
in
more
than
just
workers
compensation
benefits
when
it
instituted
this
statute.
the
incentive
to
prevent
the
accidents
is
built
into
this
scheme.
the
employer
has
an
incentive
to
prevent
accidents
by
virtue
of
the
premium
payment.
metro
should
not
be
accorded
immunity
by
tending
to
undermine
congress's
intent
in
preventing
these
accidents.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
904
is
the
duty
provision
of
the
statute,
and
905
is
the
immunity
provision.
905
simply
doesn't
award
immunity
to
anybody
but
the
employer.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that's
basically
the
entire
case,
and
the
statutory
scheme
is
consistent.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
that
is
essentially
right,
your
honor,
and
the
statute
by
its
clear
terms
defines
the
employer
as
an
employer.
an
employer
is
based
in
the
same
way
as
to
the
new
york
statute's
definition
of
employer,
and
the
new
york
courts
have
held
consistently
that
the
employer-employee
relationship
is
that
contractual
relationship
that
exists
between
a
person
who
hires
another
person
to
perform
services.
therefore,
congress
is
essentially
only
prescribing
the
rights
and
obligations
between
an
employer
and
employee,
and
it
expressly
preserves
the
common
law
rights
of
the
injured
employee
against
any
other
person.
the
language
of
933(a)
says
that
the
injured
worker
can
sue
any
person
other
than
the
employer
and
persons
in
his
employ.
it
doesn't
say,
but
not
when
the
contractor
secures
the
compensation
coverage
for
him.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
the
policies
are
issued
to
the
employers
of
the
respondents.
as
soon
as
you
come
onto
the...
if
wmata
awards
a
contract,
a
policy
is
issued
to
the
employer.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
in
the
joint
appendix
there
is
an
example,
on
joint
appendix
page
225
is
a
copy
of
the
insurance
certificate
issued
to
the
employer
of
a
number
of
the
respondents
in
these
cases,
to
ball,
healey,
and
granite.
the
insurance
certificate
is
issued
to
them,
and
they
are
the
insured
entity,
and
they
are
the
ones
on
whose
behalf
the
benefits
have
been
paid
by
this
insurance
carrier.
this
insurance
carrier
has
listed
the
employer
as
the
insured
party
with
the
department
of
labor
in
all
compensation
proceedings.
they
have--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--metro
is
listed
everywhere
as
a
policyholder.
it
is
listed
everywhere.
but
the
insured
entity--
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
--no,
it
is
not.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
it
is
not
listed
anywhere
as
a
contractor.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
metro
pays
the
premiums
for
the
policies
for
everyone
insured
under
the
coordinated
insurance
program.
mr.
william
f.
mulroney
your
honor,
not
in
the
insurance
policies,
but
metro's
status
is
listed
in
the
contracts
as
the
authority.
it
is
never
listed
as
a
contractor.
i
don't
have
the
time
to
go
into
it,
but
basically
the
respondents
maintain
that
metro
here
is
not
a
contractor
within
the
meaning
of
contract
law
or
within
the
meaning
of
the
policy
considerations
of
the
second
sentence
of
904(a),
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
are
not
under
a
duty
to
perform
a
contract
for
a
given
price.
they
are
not
in
the
construction
business.
