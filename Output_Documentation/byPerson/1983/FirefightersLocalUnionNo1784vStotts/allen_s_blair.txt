mr.
allen
s.
blair
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
court
is
confronted
with
a
situation
where
respondents
settled
an
employment
discrimination
case
for
specified
relief,
waiving
any
further
relief.
later,
because
respondents
had
not
foreseen
the
possibility
of
events
which
they
should
have
foreseen,
they
discovered
they
wanted
additional
relief
under
circumstances
which
make
the
granting
of
such
relief
inequitable
and
illegal.
the
granting
of
that
relief
is
the
subject
of
the
appeal
before
the
court
at
this
time.
this
matter
arises
out
of
the
following
background.
the
case
was
settled
in
1980
with
the
entry
of
a
consent
decree
which
provided
hiring
and
promotional
relief
consistent
with
the
complaints
which
were
filed
in
the
cause.
the
city
agreed
to
a
long
term
goal
of
raising
the
percentage
of
blacks
on
the
fire
department
in
each
rank
to
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
the
work
force
as
a
whole.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
it
was,
your
honor.
the
complaint
was
also
filed
under
section
1981
and
section
1983
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
the
decree
also
contained
what
were
interim
goals
for
hiring
and
promotions.
no
relief
was
granted
with
regard
to
the
city's
layoff
policies
or
the
city's
seniority
policies,
and
there
was
no
constructive
competitive
seniority
awarded
in
the
decree,
again
consistent
with
the
complaints,
and
the
respodents
waived
any
further
relief.
in
may
of
1981,
the
city
of
memphis,
facing
a
fiscal
crisis,
announced
that
there
would
be
layoffs
in
every
city
department,
including
the
fire
department,
and
those
layoffs
were
to
be
conducted
consistent
with
the
city's
longstanding,
city-wide
seniority
policy
which
was
adopted
with
regard
to
layoffs
in
1975.
the
respondents
sought
injunctive
relief
in
the
federal
district
court
against
the
application
of
the
senior
policy
insofar
as
it
would
reduce
the
percentage
of
blacks
on
the
fire
department.
the
district
court,
after
ruling
that
the
issue
before
the
court
was
not
whether
the
city
could
lay
off,
but
the
manner
in
which
the
city
would
lay
off,
issued
the
requested
injunctive
relief.
the
court
directed
the
city
to
come
up
with
a
plan
consistent
with
the
court's
ruling.
that
court's
order
caused
three
innocent,
incumbent,
white
firefighters
to
be
laid
off
who
would
not
have
been
laid
off
had
the
seniority
policy
been
applied.
it
also
caused
seven
additional
senior,
innocent,
incumbent,
white
drivers
to
be
demoted
or
laid
off
from
their
position
or,
in
the
parlance
of
the
shop,
bumped
down.
it
also
caused
five
additional
senior
innocent,
incumbent,
white
inspectors
to
be
bumped
down
and
nine
additional
senior,
innocent,
incumbent,
white
lieutenants
to
be
bumped
down.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
an
opinion
which
addressed
several
matters
really
not
at
issue
in
the
case.
while
the
respodents
and
the
court
of
appeals
attempt
to
uphold
the
district
court's
ruling
as
both
an
interpretation
and
a
modification
of
the
consent
decree,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
clear
the
consent
decree
did
not
provide
the
relief
requested
and
that
the
circumstances
necessary
to
allow
for
the
modification
of
a
consent
decree
are
absent
herein.
further--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--justice
rehnquist,
in
terms
of
the
ultimate
result,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
it
is
our
position
that
it
was
not
an
interpretation,
that
the
relief
was
not
provided
in
the
decree
at
all,
and
that
if
the
court
then
wants
to
take
the
next
step
and
analyze
whether
modification
would
have
been
proper
under
these
circumstances,
then
we
respectfully
submit
that
modification
was
not
proper
because
the
proper
circumstances
were
not
present
in
this
case.
i
hope
that
answers
your
question.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
justice
brennan,
they
have.
everyone
is
back
to
the
position
which
they
held
when
the
layoffs
took
place.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
however,
there
are
continuing
effects
from
this
injunction.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
yes,
as
to
them.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
as
to
them.
it
is
very
clear
that
with
regard
to
those
three
white
firefighters
who
would
not
have
been
laid
off
had
the
seniority
system
been
applied,
that
they
are
now
suffering
from
the
loss
of
competitive
seniority
status--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--they
have
lost...
they
got
no
seniority
credit
during
the
time
that
they
were
laid
off.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
that
was
approximately
a
month.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
there
is
back
pay
due
and
owing.
i
represent
the
union,
and
we
have
made
the
demand
upon
the
city.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
allen
s.
blair
the
back
pay
with
regard
to
those
three
firefighters
would
be
a
month,
but
with
regard
to
the
seven
additional
drivers,
the
five
additional
inspectors,
and
the
nine
additional
lieutenants,
there
would
also
be
back
pay
due
and
owing
by
our
contention.
now,
i
am
here
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
city--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--if
your
honor
please,
i
have
never
really
computed
that,
but
as
to
those
people
who
were
bumped
down
in
classification,
they
would
be
due
the
amount
that
is
the
difference
between
what
they
would
have
earned
had
they
been
retained
on
the
job
and
what
they
earned
in
a
lower-paying
classification.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
it's
the
union's
contention
that
the
city
does.
now,
the--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
a
proposition
that
the
city
could,
by
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen,
as
respondents
contend,
right
the
wrong
and
make
this
case
moot,
is
tantamount
to
suggesting
that
if
a
case
can
be
settled,
a
case
is
moot.
every
case
can
be
settled,
and
under
that
proposition,
every
case
would
be
moot.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
say
it,
the
case
was
not
moot.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
because
this
case
is
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
as
spelled
out
in
our
joint
opposition
to
the
suggestion
of
mootness
and
as
spelled
out
in
our
reply
brief
in
detail,
we
clearly
feel
that
this
case
falls
within
that
doctrine
as
well.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
it
did.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
believe
it
has
any
effect
whatsoever.
it
is--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--that's
right.
if
your
honor
please,
this
layoff,
this
senior-based
layoff
policy
that
is
in
question
in
this
case
was
unilaterally
adopted
by
the
city
as
well
in
1975,
and
it
is
our
position
that
a
senior
system
need
not
be
collectively
bargained
under
703(h)
in
order
to
be
protected.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
that's
right.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
right.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
that's
right.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
right.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
sabatini
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
i
believe
703(h)
makes
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
necessity
of
a
seniority
system
being
collectively
bargained
in
order
to
be
protected.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
i
would
say
most
are,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
exclusively,
and
we
would
submit
that
there
are
at
least
some
mentions
in
the
legislative
history
which
would
support
our
position
as
well.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
there
are
a
few
decisions
which
have
ruled
on
this
question,
and
they
are
mentioned
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
international
association
of
firefighters
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it
would
be
our
position
on
behalf
of
the
union
that
it
certainly
should--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
see
why
that
would
be
necessary
if
this
order
is
reversed.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
if
your
honor
please,
there
can
be--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--excuse
me.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
the
fact
that
there
are
these
continuing
effects
and
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
deals
with
the
doctrine
of
or
is
affected
by,
covered
by,
if
you
will,
the
doctrine
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
so
it
may
be
that
your
honor
wants
to
ask
the
question
at
this
point.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--under
their
own
rules
and
regulations--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
certainly
they
do,
but
they
haven't.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it
certainly
would
be
our
contention
on
behalf
of
the
union
that
if
they
have
a
rule
and
regulation
that
is
in
effect
and
an
obligation
arises
out
of
the
enforcement
of
that
rule
and
regulation,
that
an
employer
could
not
at
that
point
at
its
whim
say,
well,
that's
not
our
rule
and
regulation
anymore,
after
the
fact,
and
thereby
in
effect
erase
the
obligation
or
do
away
with
the
obligation.
it
certainly
is
true
that
management
has
a
lot
of
normal
management
prerogatives
which
it
can
change
during
the
course
of
the
employment
relationship,
but
if
there
is
an
obligation
that
arises
out
of
an
area
covered
by
or
a
rule
or
regulation
which
arises
out
of
an
area
that
is
covered
by
normal
management
prerogative,
i
don't
think
management
can
then
erase
the
obligation
by
simply
saying,
well,
we
are
going
to
change
it
now.
the
rule
and
regulation
was
in
effect
then.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
true
that
as
to
those
people
who
were
laid
off--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--when
you
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
seniority
list,
if
you
will,
that
the
three
white
firefighters
were
affected
were
hired
the
same
day
as
the
three
blacks
who
would
have
been
affected
had
the
seniority
policy
of
the
city
been
applied.
that
is
true.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
that's
right.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
as
i
think
this
court
recognized
in
california
brewers,
every
seniority
system
is
going
to
have
aspects
of
that
system
which
are
not
based
on
the
length
of
employment.
what
you
have
here
is
a
facially
neutral,
nondiscriminatory,
alphabetical
tie-breaker
designed
to
apply
in
just
this
situation,
and
the
source
was
that
the
city
was
trying
to
find
a
fair
way
to
establish
or
create
a
tie-breaker.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
i
do,
justice
powell.
i
think
it
is
very
definitely
true.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
explain
with
regard
to
that.
the
city
of
memphis
has
an
extremely
limited
tax
base.
income
taxes
on
the
state
and
local
level
in
tennessee
are
unconstitutional.
the
city
of
memphis
is
already
taxing
at
the
maximum
level
at
which
it
can
tax
at
the
present
time
insofar
as
sales
tax
is
concerned.
we
can't
raise
the
sales
tax
again.
as
regards
our
property
tax,
there
was
a
one-time
decrease
when
the
last
sales
tax
increase
came
into
effect,
but
we
are
really,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
at
the
peak
of
the
property
tax
at
this
particular
time.
we
have
a
rather
odd
situation
where
industrial
and
commercial
property
in
tennessee
is
actually
taxed
at
a
higher
rate
than
residential
property
which
naturally
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
business
and
industry
to
move
into
our
area.
therefore,
the
local
lawmakers
are
extremely
hesitant
to
raise
those
taxes.
now,
given
that
situation,
you
have
to
superimpose
on
that
the
fact
that
the
city
is
a
business
like
any
other
business,
and
it
has
increasing
costs
at
the
present
time.
it
has
suffered
under
extremely
high
interest
rates,
continues
to
suffer
under
that
at
the
present
time.
the
spiraling
cost
of
health
care
affects
the
city
because
it
provides
at
least
in
part
health
care
coverage
to
its
employees.
and
there
are
other
increasing
costs.
employee
wages
continue
to
increase.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
justice
marshall,
i
can't
really
speak
authoritatively
to
that
except
that
i
would
say
this,
that
i
don't
imagine
that
there
are
a
great
many
cities
which
are
in
the
position
of
memphis
in
that
they
have
reached
the
maximum
sales
tax
that
they
can
impose.
other
than
that
and
the
income
tax,
i
would
say
no,
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
your
honor
that
those
are
significant
differences.
you
are
talking
about
two
of
what
are
the
three
major
sources
normally
that
a
municipality
has
for
income.
to
continue
to
address
your
question,
justice
powell,
it
also
seems
to
me
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
evades
review.
as
this
court
has
previously
recognized,
as
noted
in
our
reply
brief,
layoffs
are,
by
their
nature,
temporary.
now,
that
is
not
a
hard
and
fast
rule,
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
its
prior
decisions,
and
we
would
submit
that
this
case
clearly
falls
within
the
doctrine
of
capable
of
repetition,
yet
evading
review.
with
regard
to
the
interpretation
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
any
claim
of
the
respondents
that
is
based
on
an
interpretation
or
effectuation
of
the
consent
decree
must
be
settled
with
reference
to
the
terms
of
that
consent
decree,
and
the
terms
here
are
completely
unavailing
to
the
respondents.
what
we
really
have
here
is
a
situation
where
they
sought
new
relief
barred
by
the
waiver
to
bail
them
out.
in
fact,
the
situation
was
clearly
foreseeable.
we
have
a
situation
where
the
city
adopted
a
seniority-based
layoff
policy
in
1975.
it
was
negotiated
into
the
union's
contract
in
1975.
therefore,
the
union
and
the
city
foresaw
the
serious
possibility
of
layoffs
in
1975
and
codified
that
concern,
if
you
will,
in
a
public
document.
other
cities
were
experiencing
a
great
many
financial
difficulties
at
that
time.
in
our
own
circuit,
the
city
of
cincinnati
had
to
lay
off
in
their
fire
department
and
confronted
a
dispute
very
much
like
this
one
which
went
to
the
sixth
circuit,
which
resulted
in
an
opinion
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
1978,
of
which
the
respondents
should
have
been
aware.
and
we
would
submit
that
any
plaintiff
in
a
title
7
case
must
analyze
the
relief
that
he
or
she
is
getting
in
a
consent
decree
by
way
of
those
landmark
events
in
the
employment
relationship,
hiring,
promotion,
demotion,
layoff
and
recall,
termination,
and
retirement,
and
look
at
the
relief
that
they
are
going
to
get
in
the
consent
decree
and
say
is
this
all
that
i
am
entitled
to,
is
this
all
that
i
need?
clearly
they
should
have
foreseen
it.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
no.
i
think
that,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
what
we
really
had,
as
is
true
in
any
consent
decree,
is
that
the
parties
waive
their
right
to
litigate
the
issues
when
you
enter
into
a
consent
decree.
that's
really
what--
mr.
allen
s.
blair
--with
regard
to
the
relief
granted,
yes,
but
not
with
regard
to
additional
relief
that
might
be
requested
later.
really
what
we
think
we
have
here
is
an
arm's
length
bargained
agreement
which
should
have
been
honored
by
the
court,
and
given
that
an
interpretation
would
not
avail
respondents
of
the
relief
that
they
are
requesting
and
a
modification
was
not
proper,
in
light
of
the
waiver,
then
really
the
court
should
have
stopped
there--
but
given
the
fact
that
the
court
went
further,
if
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
go
further,
then
clearly,
the
court
couldn't
say
that
we
waived,
that
is,
the
city
and
the
union,
waived
our
right
to
insist
that
victim
status
be
proved
and
established.
i
hope
i
have
answered
your
question.
i
notice
that
my
time
is
running
out,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
at
least
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
would
finally
close
by
saying
that
if
this
case
is
not
reversed,
it
will
seriously
discourage
title
7
settlements
in
the
future.
thank
you.
mr.
allen
s.
blair
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
