unknown
speaker
i
take
it
this
was
a
title
7
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
blair,
in
your
view,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
this
is
treated
as
an
interpretation
of
the
decree
or
a
motion
to
modify
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blair,
may
i
ask,
have
any
of
these
white
firefighters
been
reinstated?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
to
them?
unknown
speaker
as
to
those
who
have
been
reinstated?
unknown
speaker
what
exactly
have
they
lost?
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
was
that?
unknown
speaker
a
month.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
is
that
also
a
month,
mr.
blair?
unknown
speaker
is
the
back
pay
also
a
month?
unknown
speaker
how,
by
your
contention,
how
much
would
they
be
owing?
unknown
speaker
does
the
city
have
any
authority
to
make
then
whole
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
that
it
does?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
does,
why
isn't
this
case
moot?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
your
contention
were
accepted
by
the...
you
said
you
are
asking
the
city
to
make
them
whole.
suppose
the
city
were
to
do
so.
would
you
say
the
case
was
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
you
still
say
it's
not.
why?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask,
did
the
tennessee
supreme
court
hold
that
the
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
union
was
unenforceable?
unknown
speaker
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
bear,
if
it
does,
on
the
provision
of
703(h)
as
to
bona
fide
seniority
system?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
illegal
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
independently
of
the
memorandum
with
the
union,
which
i
gather
your
state
court
has
said
is
unenforceable.
unknown
speaker
void
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
unilateral
policy
which--
unknown
speaker
--provided
this?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
most
of
them
are,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
that
has
passed
on
this
question,
any
decisions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blair,
if
the
district
court's
order
is
invalidated,
does
back
pay
and
seniority
automatically
follow?
unknown
speaker
would
a
separate
suit
be
necessary
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
obviously
my
questions
indicate
that
i,
too,
am
concerned
about
mootness.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
why
it
would
automatically--
unknown
speaker
--finish
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun.
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
had.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
did
want
to
ask
about
the
specific
consequences
because
i
was
wondering
if,
as
you
answered
in
response
to
justice
brennan,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
enforceable,
what
is
the
source
of
the
city's
legal
obligation
to
pay
the
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
they
have
the
power
to
do
it,
but
i
think
you
are
also
contending
on
behalf
of
the
union
they
have
an
obligation
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
just
the
matter
of
their
own
rules
and
regulations.
unknown
speaker
don't
they
have
the
power
to
change
those
rules?
unknown
speaker
so
in
all
events,
isn't
it
a
managerial
decision
as
to
whether
they
will
pay
the
back
pay
and
the
seniority,
regardless
of
who
wins
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
sort
of
a
stop.
may
i
also
ask,
i
gather
all
these
employees
that
are
affected
by
it
were
hired
an
the
same
day,
november
5,
'79
according
to--
unknown
speaker
--right.
unknown
speaker
and
the
policy
apparently
required
they
be
laid
off
in
reverse
alphabetical
order,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
source
of
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
it
as
the
city's
decision
rather
than
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that's
really
what
i
was
asking.
unknown
speaker
okay,
thank
you.
mr.
blair,
you
mentioned
the
likelihood
of
this
same
problem
arising
in
the
future.
do
you
think
that
is
true
with
respect
to
memphis?
unknown
speaker
is
any
of
that
other
than
the
income
tax
unique
to
memphis
as
compared
to
every
other
large
city
in
this
country?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blair,
did
the
department
when
it
entered
into
the
consent
decree
waive
its
right
to
prove
that
future
beneficiaries
of
the
affirmative
action
were
not
actual
victims
of
the
discrimination,
if
it
existed?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
department
waive
its
right
to
prove
that
these
people
who
benefitted
from
the
order
of
the
court
were
not
actual
victims
of
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
can
the
employer
entering
into
a
consent
decree
waive
that
requirement,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
solicitor
general,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
particular
memorandum
between
the
union
and
the
employer
is
unenforceable
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
just
let
me
ask,
that
doesn't
bear
on
the
question
whether
this
is
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
within
703(h)?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
just
be
sure,
under
your
argument,
if
the
parties
in
advance
had
agreed
on
precisely
what
the
district
court
ordered
as
a
part
of
the
original
consent
decree,
are
you
contending
that
would
have
been
beyond
the
court's
power
to
approve?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
doesn't
your
argument
depend
on
the
court's
order
being
a
modification
as
opposed
to
an
interpretation
of
the
decree?
if
the
judge
had
in
effect
said
this
is
what
i
think
everybody
really
agreed
to,
then
i
suppose
your
argument
would
fall.
he
didn't
say
that,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--you
certainly
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
city
itself,
by
agreeing
to
a
consent
decree,
could
waive
the
rights
of
nonvictims.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fields,
do
you,
do
you
contend
that
the
order
entered
by
judge
mcrea
in
this
case,
the
most
recent
order,
is
a
modification?
unknown
speaker
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
principal
issue
raised
on
this
appeal
is
where
the
district
court
erred
in
modifying
the
1980
decree.
unknown
speaker
then
you
do
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
it
was
a
modification.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
then
referred
to
it
as
modifying
the
decree?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
suggest
we
do
if
we
agree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
a
determination.
you
say
it's
moot.
we
don't
need
to
determine
it,
and
wouldn't
we...
wouldn't
we
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
and
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to
tell
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
case?
unknown
speaker
completely,
and
do
away
with
the
consent
decree,
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
a
judgment,
isn't
it?
a
consent
decree
is
a
judgment,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why...
normally,
normally
we
strip
the
whole
thing
down
clear
through
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you...
i
don't
know...
you
can't...
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that...
unless
you
say
that
the
case...
unless
the
mootness
necessarily
undermines
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--could
we
ever
hold
that
a
particular
part
of
a
decree
was
moot
without
holding
that
the
whole
case
was
moot?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
still
an
underlying
case
in
controversy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fields?
unknown
speaker
if
the
city
was
short
of
money
again,
could
this
situation
be
repeated
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
asking
whether
it
is
possible
that
in
the
future
this
city
might
run
short
of
money
and
need
to
implement
some
kind
of
a
layoff
program.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
department
was
bound
by
the
city's
seniority
plan.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
department
was
bound
by
the
city's
plan.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
fields,
that
on
page
31
of
your
brief--
unknown
speaker
--in
arguing
mootness,
you
say
this:
even
if
the
may
18
order
were
reversed,
employees
who
were
laid
off
in
1981
still
would
receive
no
seniority
credit
for
that
period
unless
the
city
itself
chooses
to
alter
its
layoff
policy.
unknown
speaker
is
that
tennessee
law
or
is
that
federal
law
or
what?
unknown
speaker
why
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
making,
they
are
making,
they
are
litigating
the
issue
here,
and
unless
they
have,
unless
they
win
on
this
issue,
there
is
no
basis
for
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
well,
if
they
win,
there
is
a
basis
for
it,
an
arguable
basis
for
it,
so
there
is
no
use
in
making
claims
until
there
is
some
arguable
basis
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
any
of
them
losers
of
a
month's
back
pay
and
seniority
credit?
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
those
reinstated
employees
nevertheless
out
a
month's
back
pay
and
seniority
credit?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
unilaterally
it
can
pay
them
a
month's
back
pay?
unknown
speaker
and
what...
how
do
they
restore
the
month's
seniority
credit?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
matter
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
city
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
then
there
is
a
way
to
enforce
that
by
the
individuals?
unknown
speaker
then
it
doesn't
carry
much
water
here,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
it
that
because
of
this
it
is
not
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
under
703(h)?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
there
just
isn't
any
seniority
system.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fields,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
the
mootness
and
all
that.
unknown
speaker
in
effect
you
have
argued,
well,
the
city
is
spending
a
lot
of
money
which
it
didn't
need
to
spend
because
it
could
just
pay
these
people,
if
it
wanted
to,
and
give
them
retroactive
seniority.
isn't
the
other
side
of
the
coin
that
you
are
up
here
arguing
about
something
your
clients
really
don't
care
about?
why
do
you
bother
arguing
the
merits
if
it
is
moot?
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
lose--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
kind
of
giving
us
an
advisory
opinion
on
what
we
ought
to
do
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
but
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
we
had
a
case
last
year
involving
a
boston
firefighter.
i
mean,
our
judgment
has
to
be
not
so
much
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
might
happen
again
in
memphis,
but
whether
this
kind
of
a
situation
is
apt
to
evade
review.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
same
peculiar
facts
roughly
obtained
in
the
boston
situation,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
your
view
about
a
consent
decree,
mr.
fields,
that
provides
provisions
for
not
just
hiring
preference
for
minorities
but
promotional
preferences?
do
you
think
the
city
could
enter
into
a
consent
decree
which
would
affect
the
rights
of
existing
nonminority
people
to
promotion?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
have
a
right
to
participate,
but
the
decree
could
adversely
affect
their
seniority
expectations.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
not
a
title
7
decree
that
simply
affects
hiring.
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
upheld
one
like
that
that
didn't
deal
only
with
people
who
are
identifiable
victims?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
meant
one
which
we
had
actually
reviewed.
unknown
speaker
neither
am
i.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
have
to...
your
position,
i
suppose,
is
that
it
would
have
to
be
some
real
basis
for
thinking
that
the
so-called
innocent
third
parties
had
waived
their
rights
by
participating
in
the
negotiations
or
in
the
case
and
agreeing
to
the
consent
decree.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't...
would
you...
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
just
the
city,
just
the
city
and
your
clients
could
between
the
two
of
them
agree
to
a
consent
decree
that
would
go
farther
than
teamsters
would
seemingly
permit.
unknown
speaker
you
know
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
basis
for
thinking
that
the
union
represented
the
people
who
might
possibly
be
affected
by
this
decree?
unknown
speaker
so
without
the
union
there,
or
without
the
individual
participation
of
the
nonminority
members,
there
wouldn't...
the
city
and
your
clients
couldn't
enter
into
a
decree
that
would
go
farther
than
teamsters
would
permit.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
just
wouldn't
bind,
it
just
wouldn't
bind
the
people
who
hadn't
participated
in
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
assume
they
didn't,
assume
they
just
didn't
participate.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
really
suggesting
that
the
union
here
stood
by
and
agreed
to
this
decree
knowing
and
realizing
that
they
were
sacrificing
rights
to
competitive
seniority?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
do
you
think
that
they
thought
they
were
agreeing
that
nonvictims
could
be
awarded
competitive
seniority?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
believe
that
they
were
agreeing
to
granting
nonvictims
competitive
seniority,
at
least
with
respect
to
layoffs.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
agreed
before
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
this
case
were
reversed,
what
would
the
real
effect
be
on
parties
who
are
contemplating
a
consent
decree?
would
it
be
likely
to
encourage
them
to
at
least
address
these
issues
in
the
consent
decree
and
not
have
a
decree
like
this
one
that
didn't
address
layoffs?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
practical
effect
is
that
the
parties
would
be
likely
in
the
future
to
certainly
consider
and
address
in
the
decree
of
layoffs,
then
you
get
back
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
the
city
and
the
union,
for
example,
can
affect
in
the
terms
of
the
decree
the
rights
of
any
innocent
employees
for
layoff
purposes.
