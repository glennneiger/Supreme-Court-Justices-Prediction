mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
squarely
controlled
by
this
court's
holding
in
teamsters
v.
united
states
that
federal
courts
lack
the
power
to
grant
constructive,
competitive
seniority
to
nonvictims
of
employment
discrimination,
that
is,
those
who
have
not
shown
that
they
individually
are
persons
against
whom
discrimination
was
practiced.
in
teamsters,
the
district
court
found
that
the
employer
had
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
against
blacks
and
spanish-surnamed
americans,
and
in
order
to
remedy
this
discrimination,
the
court
of
appeals
awarded
constructive,
retroactive
seniority
to
each
member
of
the
class.
the
previous
term,
in
franks
v.
bowman
transportation
company,
the
court
had
held
that
proven
individual
victims
were
entitled
to
be
slotted
into
their
rightful
place
in
the
seniority
system,
that
is,
the
place
that
they
would
have
enjoyed
but
for
the
discrimination.
under
franks,
therefore,
both
the
discriminatees
and
also
their
innocent
coworkers
whose
rights
are
necessarily
affected
by
the
grant
of
constructive
competitive
seniority,
are
relegated
to
the
respective
positions
that
they
would
have
enjoyed
if
the
discrimination
had
never
occurred,
but
for
persons
not
proven
to
be
victims,
the
court
held
in
teamsters
that
such
an
award
of
constructive
seniority
is
outside
the
remedial
authority
of
a
federal
court.
the
defect
in
this
court's
order,
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
is
that
what
the
court
did
here
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
teamsters
that
a
federal
court
cannot
do,
namely,
grant
constructive
competitive
seniority
to
persons
who
have
not
proven
that
they
are
actual
victims.
and
the
only
difference
is
in
the
timing.
under
teamsters,
the
district
court
could
not
have
given
enhanced
competitive
seniority
at
the
time
of
its
original
decree
against
the
possibility
of
layoffs
to
nonvictims.
certainly
it
has
no
power,
no
greater
power
once
they
occur.
this
court
has
observed
frequently,
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
hardison,
that
seniority
systems
are
afforded
special
treatment
under
title
7,
and
indeed,
it
is
quite
apparent
from
the
legislative
history
of
title
7
that
the
dirksen-mansfield
compromise
which
brought
703(h)
into
existence
was
key
to
the
enactment
of
title
7.
given
the
importance
of
seniority
systems
to
title
7,
it
would
make
no
sense
at
all,
we
submit,
to
ignore
seniority
in
the
single
context
where
it
really
matters,
particularly
when
you
consider
that
beginning
with
franks
in
1976,
this
court
has
been
called
upon
with
some
frequency
and
in
various
contexts
to
reach
an
accommodation
between
the
achievement
on
the
one
hand
of
the
twin
objectives
of
title
7,
which
is
to
eliminate
discrimination
and
compensate
its
victims,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
protection
of
bona
fide
seniority
systems.
there
are
about
a
half
a
dozen
such
cases
that
deal
with
that
accommodation,
and
the
opinions
are
characterized
by
two
persistent
themes.
the
first
of
those
themes
focuses
on
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
title
7
remedial
orders,
and
draws
a
bright
line
distinction
between
victims
and
nonvictims,
and
that's
franks
and
teamsters.
the
second
theme
concerns
the
other
half
of
the
remedial
calculus
which
is
who
pays
the
bill,
and
more
specifically,
to
what
extent
are
the
costs
for
eradicating
employment
discrimination
and
compensating
its
victims,
to
be
borne
by
those
who
did
the
discriminating,
namely,
the
employers,
through
back
pay,
front
pay,
enhanced
benefits
seniority,
if
you
will,
and
to
what
extent
by
innocent
victims...
or
excuse
me,
third-party
innocent
coworkers,
other
employees
who
have
done
no
wrong
but
whose
rights
will
necessarily
be
affected
if
the
remedy
includes
an
award
of
competitive
seniority
because
as
this
court
observed
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
in
fort
motor,
a
competitive
seniority
award
costs
the
employer
nothing
and
sends
the
bill
to
fellow
workers.
out
of
these
cases,
the
law
which
has
emerged
is
clear,
and
it
is
that
there
is
only
one
circumstance
under
which
federal
courts
are
empowered
as
part
of
their
remedy
for
employment
discrimination,
to
award
competitive
seniority
rights,
and
that
is
where
the
beneficiaries
of
those
competitive
rights
are
actual
victims.
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
suppose
that
an
employer
could,
as
a
matter
of
agreement,
at
the
front
end
of
the
decree,
could
agree
to
it,
and
thereby
would
waive
it,
but
teamsters
is
rather
careful
in
spelling
out
the
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed,
and
it
is
a
two-step
procedure.
the
first
step
is
the
process
of
proving
pattern
and
practice,
and
the
second
step
is
the
practice
of
proving,
or
is
the
process
of
proving
who
is
a
victim.
from
one
perspective,
franks
itself,
which
does
grant
competitive
seniority
to
actual
victims,
imposes
part
of
the
cost
on
innocent
coworkers,
but
at
least
under
franks,
the
cost
distribution
among
the
victims
and
the
innocent
coworkers
is
the
same
distribution
that
would
have
occurred
if
there
had
been
no
discrimination.
it
simply
puts
the
relative
parties
back
in
the
same
position
that
they
would
have
enjoyed
in
the
absence
of
discrimination.
to
go
beyond
that
and
to
require
that
coworkers
bear
the
burdens
that
they
would
not
have
borne
even
if
their
employer
had
never
discriminated
is
to
go
beyond
the
limits
of
federal
judicial
power,
and
that's
what
teamsters
holds.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
does
not,
justice
brennan,
for
this
reason.
what
is
before--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
it
does
not
because
it
is
very
clear
from
the
record
in
this
case,
from
the
testimony
of
the
mayor
and
others
in
the
joint
appendix
that
absent
the
court
order,
the
city
is
within
its
right
as
a
matter
of
its
own
exercise
of
governmental
prerogatives,
would
have
followed
this
seniority
system
it
was
the
city's
system,
so
that
absent
the
court
order,
it
is
the
seniority
system
that
would
have
prevailed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
so
long
as
those
innocent
third
parties
were
in
fact
represented,
as
i
think
they
could
have
been
held
to
have
been
represented
by
the
firefighters
union
which
did
intervene
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
was
a
kind
of
a
logical
sequence,
you
could
make
that
order,
but
that
is
far
too
much
of
a
distortion
of
the
interests
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
of
innocent
third
workers,
third
parties,
to
say
that
they
did
in
fact
agree
to
that,
because
in
fact
they
simply
never
got
beyond
the
pattern
and
practice
issue
in
that
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
not,
and
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
hope
that
i
was
making.
the
assertion
by
the
respondents
and
several
amici
that
title
7
seniority
guarantees,
703(h),
is
substantive
and
not
remedial
simply
cannot
survive
this
court's
decisions
in
teamsters
and
ford
motor.
the
issue
in
ford
motor,
for
example,
was
not
whether
the
provisions
of
the
seniority
system
substantively
amounted
to
employment
discrimination,
but
rather,
whether
the
proposed
remedies
permissible,
in
the
language
of
this
court's
closing
sentence,
threaten
the
interests
of
other
innocent
employees
by
disrupting
the
established
seniority
hierarchy.
teamsters
and
ford
motor
amply
demonstrate
the
obvious,
that
in
crafting
equitable
remedies
under
title
7,
federal
courts
are
not
free
to
ignore
the
effect
that
those
remedies
will
have
on
substantive
title
7
policies,
and
the
protection
of
seniority
systems
is
certainly
one
of
those
policies.
finally,
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
notwithstanding
the
defects...
i
mean,
teamsters
is
simply
unavoidable.
teamsters
does
control
this
case.
teamsters
is
a
title
7
decision.
but
the
respondents
and
their
amici
nevertheless
suggest
that
title
7
is
not
the
only
source
of
judicial
authority
to
enter
this
decree.
that
argument
will
notwithstand
analysis
because
under
any
circumstance
it
was
an
equitable
decree,
and
basic
principles
of
equity
teach
that
federal
courts
applying
equitable
principles
are
to
shape
those
decrees
in
accord
with
the
substantive
policies
to
be
achieved.
this
is,
above
all,
an
employment
discrimination
decree.
the
federal
policy
dealing
with
employment
discrimination
is
contained
in
title
7,
and
under
those
circumstances,
under
any
argument,
the
content
of
an
employment
discrimination
decree
must
be
shaped
by
the
substantive
policies
of
title
7,
including
the
protection
of
seniority
systems.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
else.
