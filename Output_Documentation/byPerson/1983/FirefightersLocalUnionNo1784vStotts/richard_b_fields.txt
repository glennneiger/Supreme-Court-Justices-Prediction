mr.
richard
b.
fields
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like...
i
think
this
case
provides
us
with
two
issues:
first,
whether
the
case
was
moot
because
the
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
judge
mcrea
has
been
irrevocably
carried
out,
and
the
court's
review
of
that
injunction
would
not
affect
any
of
the
parties'
legal
rights
in
this
matter;
secondly,
if
this
case
is
not
moot,
then
was
the
preliminary
injunction
a
proper
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion
to
enter
an
order
necessary
to
effectuate
the
specific
purpose
of
the
decree,
that
is,
to
remedy
the
hiring
and
promotional
practices
of
the
city
of
memphis
in
their
fire
department--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
sir,
i
do
not
contend
it's
a
modification.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
well,
your
honor,
first,
it's
our
belief
that
the
district
court
simply
effectuated
the
purpose
of
the
decree,
and
did--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
i
do
not
think
the
court
of
appeals...
no.
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
in
brown
v.
neeb,
judge
brown
specifically
talks
about
modification
in
terms
of
effectuating
the
purpose
of
the
decree.
that's
the
terms
the
court
of
appeals
was
speaking
of
about
modification.
there
is
no
layoff
provision
in
the
decree,
as
we
have
all...
as
admitted,
and
so
there
is
really
no
specific
provision
to
modify.
our
position
is
the
court
was
simply
enforcing
the
decree
as
written.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
think
if
we
get
to
that
point,
if
you
were
speaking
strictly
about
modification
of
law,
this
is
not
in
terms
of
modifying,
for
example,
in
the
antitrust
cases
where
defendants
want
to
be
released
from
certain
obligations
of
the
decree.
first,
if
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
moot.
all
of
the
people
that
were
laid
off
by
the
1981
preliminary
injunction
have
been
rehired.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
i
suggest
that
you
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
for
a
determination
of
mootness.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
sir.
this
order
on
appeal
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--the
consent
decree
is,
yes,
sir,
but
this--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
this
court
has--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--the
only
thing
on
appeal
in
this
case
is
the
preliminary
injunction
that
the
district
court
entered
in
may
of
1981.
the
consent
decree
is
not
before
the
court.
that
was
presented
in
orders
v.
stotts
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
review
on
on
november
1,
1982.
the
consent
decree
itself
has
not
been
attacked
by
any
of
the
parties.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
well,
but
the
mootness
doesn't
go
to
the
specific...
the
provisions
of
the
consent
decree.
the
mootness--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--your
honor,
i
am...
my
position
is
in
this
court,
and
i
don't
think
anyone
has
said
to
the
contrary,
that
the
decree
itself
is
valid,
that--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
there's
no
underlying
case
in
controversy
in
terms
of
the
court's
preliminary
injunction
as
a
result
of
further
enforcing
the
decree.
the
decree
itself
is
not
under
attack
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
different
case.
in
between
the
time
of
may
1981
and
the
present,
the
city
has
not
only
put
all
of
these
people
back
to
work,
it
has
hired
63
new
firefighters,
it
has
decreased
the
property
taxes,
and
it
is
moving
forward
in
its
remedial
obligation
under
the
decree.
a
tax--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--yes,
your
honor,
but
that
layoff
would
have
to
be
determined
as
to
those
circumstances.
for
example,
in
this
layoff,
if
there
had
only
been
a
layoff
of
21
firefighters
instead
of
24,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
adverse
impact
upon
the
minority
percentages
at
that
rank.
so
as
the
city
moves
to
its
obligation
to
remedy
the
past
discrimination
in
the
fire
department,
those
circumstances
would
change.
it
must
be
emphasized
that
judge
mcrea
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
only
requiring
the
city
to
maintain
certain
percentages
in
certain
classifications.
he
did
not
order
any
specific
method
of
layoff.
it
was
at
the
city's
sole
discretion
to
come
forward
with
what
method
of
layoff
it
wanted
to,
and
it
just
so
happened
the
city
came
forward
again
with
a
seniority-based
layoff
system.
the
city...
in
fact,
the
union,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
asked
the
city
not
to
lay
off
anyone,
to
provide
a
system
where
workers
could
voluntarily
take
leaves
of
absences
so
other
workers
could
remain
on
the
force.
another
union--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
your
honor.
the
city
never
adopted
any
layoff
policy.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
the
fire
department?
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
it
was,
but
the
city
is
the
defendant
in
this
case.
it
is
the
memphis
fire
department
and
the
city
of
memphis,
and
the
city
never
adopted
a
formal
layoff
policy
until
april
of
1981,
just
before
these
layoffs.
there
was
never
any
city
policy
about
layoffs.
there
was
the
memorandum
of
understanding
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
unenforceable.
it
was
really
at
the
city's
sole
discretion
on
how
to
lay
off.
if
you
look
into
the
layoff
policy,
seniority
was
not
the
only
factor.
the
first
thing
the
city
was
required
to
do
was
to
measure
the
various
qualifications
among
the
employees,
and
then
they
could
apply
seniority.
if
there
were
specific
positions
in
the
fire
department
that
the
city
wished
to
be
exempted
from
layoff,
they
could.
there
were
only
certain
jobs
in
the
fire
department
that
were
subject
to
layoff
it
just
so
happened
that
these
jobs
were
where
most
of
the
gains
had
been
made
in
the
prior
year
under
this
consent
decree,
and
that
is
the
reason
judge
mcrea
entered
the
preliminary
injunction,
to
maintain,
for
the
city
to
maintain
the
remedy
that
had
been
achieved
thus
far.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
that's
the
state
of...
the
state
of
the
situation
in
the
court
now.
there
is
no
claim
in
the
district
court
by
any
employees
for
seniority
or
back
pay.
there
is
no
claim
in
any
forum
in
tennessee
for
those
things.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
because
the
union
or
those
employees
have
never
made
a
claim
for
that.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
if
they
win
or
they
lose,
your
honor,
there
is
no
basis
for
it.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
well,
your
honor,
there
is
no
basis
for
it
because
everything
has
been
achieved
by
the
preliminary
injunction.
all
of
these
employees
are
back
at
work
and
even
if
this
court
affirmed,
the
district
court
would
not
grant
seniority
to
these
employees.
it
is...
you
know,
also,
the
court
needs
to
understand,
it
was
not
only
these
employees
that
were
laid
off.
there
were
24
employees
laid
off.
there
were
three
black
firefighters
laid
off.
there
were
also
other
black
employees
of
the
fire
department
that
were
laid
off
because
their
jobs
were
abolished.
the
home
fire
safety
representatives,
as
mentioned
in
our
appendix,
those
were
mostly
black
employees,
and
their
jobs
were
abolished.
this
was
not
simply
a
layoff
of
white
employees
to
maintain
blacks
in
certain
jobs.
and
those
are
the
circumstances
under
which
judge
mcrea
entered
the
preliminary
injunction
after
a
hearing
on
the
matter.
also,
your
honors,
these
three
employees
have
been
back
for
approximately
two
and
a
half
years.
the
petitioners
argue
that
there
are
continuing
effects.
first,
they
argue
that
these
employees
missed
an
opportunity
to
take
promotional
exams.
in
their
reply
brief
they
admit
error.
they
also
say
that
these
employees
would
be...
their,
their
ability
to
become
30
year
captains
would
be
delayed
by
this
loss
of
seniority.
they
admit
that
is
an
error
because
that
provision
of
the
city
charter
was
repealed
in
1977,
and
these
employees
who
were
laid
off
were
hired
in
1979.
again,
i
would
emphasize
that
nothing
this
court
would
do
will
change
that
situation.
all
the
employees
are
back
to
work.
in
fact,
some
of
the
employees
who
were
laid
off
not
only
are
back
in
their
original
positions,
but
they
have
received
promotions.
the
fire
department--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
fields
they
are
as
a
result
of
what
the
city
did,
but
like
we
say
in
our
brief,
the
city
could
change
that
unilaterally,
just
as
it
adopted
this
layoff
program
unilaterally.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
absolutely,
your
honor.
there
is--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--they
just
grant
the
seniority,
change
their
seniority
days.
it
is...
the
loss
of
seniority
is
the
city's
policy.
even
if
you
look
at
the
memorandum
of
understanding,
that
is
not
in
the
memorandum
of
understanding
that
has
any
effect
at
all
as
delineating
what
the
city's
policy
is.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
sir,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
there
is
no
way
to
enforce
it.
it
is
not--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--in
this
court?
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
sir,
and
that's
my
point.
what
is
done
in
this
court
will
not
affect
that
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question,
but
it
was
never
litigated
at
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
it
was
something
that
was
adopted
by
the
city
just
prior
to
the
layoffs,
and
we
are
saying
that
the
city
had
an
enforceable
duty
under
the
consent
decree
to
remedy
past
discrimination
and
could
take
actions
that
would
abrogate
that
obligation
to
maintain
that
remedy
under
the
consent
decree.
and
that's
what
judge
mcrea
did.
he
told
the
city
that
you
cannot
reduce
the
proportion
of
blacks
in
these
ranks
pending
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
there
was
never
a
hearing
on
the
merits
for
an
injunction
in
this
matter,
and
we
never
got
into
the
proof
of
whether
it
was
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
or
not.
this
was
simply
preliminary
relief,
and
that
has
been
irrevocably
carried
out.
in
fact,
the
plan
the
city
submitted
was
not
submitted
on
may
18.
it
was
submitted
in
june
at
the
behest
of
the
court.
the
city
at
that
time
could
have
submitted
any
plan
that
met
the
court's
order.
it
just
so
happened
it
chose
a
seniority
plan
to
submit
in
june,
and
that
was
not
appealed
from
any...
by
from
any
party
in
this
case.
the
only
order
that
has
been
appealed
from
is
judge
mcrea's
may
18
preliminary
injunction
which
just
provides
that
the
city
maintain
certain
ratios
and
certain
classifications.
the
city--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--yes.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
well,
your
honor,
basically
if
it
is
moot,
then
my
clients
have
no
interest
in
it.
that's
true.
there's
nothing
that
is
going
to
harm
my
clients--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
that's
correct--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--well,
but
i
think
if
this
court
affirms,
it
is
giving
an
advisory
opinion
to
the
city
on
something
that
is
not
in
controversy
anymore.
may
i
also
say
in
terms
of
the
capable
of
review
but
evading...
evading
review
but
capable
of
repetition
argument,
the
city
argues
that
memphis
is
peculiar,
for
some
reason,
that
this
may
happen
again
very
soon.
it
must
be
understood
that
this
was
the
first
layoff
ever
in
the
history
of
the
city
of
memphis.
even
during
the
'74-'75
recession
there
was
no
layoff
of
city
employees
by
the
city
of
memphis,
even
though
layoffs
were
prevalent
throughout
the
country.
and--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--but
in
layoffs,
your
honor...
but,
your
honor,
layoffs
are
not
inherently
capable
of
evading
review,
or
capable
of
not
being
reviewed
because
as
one
of
our
amicus
briefs
shows,
in
the
city
of
detroit,
approximately
600
black,
or
600
police
officers
were
laid
off
in
1980,
and
about
half
of
those
remain
on
layoff
today.
in
major
industries
throughout
the
country,
particularly
in
the
steel
industry,
employees
were
permanently
laid
off
when
steel
companies
were
shut
down.
it
is
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
situation
that
this
has
been
carried
out,
that
the
people
have
come
back
to
work
and
are
back
in
their
position--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--yes,
but
in
that,
of
course,
we
don't
know
how
long
the
layoffs
would
have
happened
because
in
the
boston
case
the
state
legislature
passed
a
statute
mandating
that
the
workers
be
put
back
to
work.
that's
what
intervened.
layoffs
themselves,
though,
are
not
inherently
short
of
duration,
and
there
are
facts
in
other
instances
to
show
that--
also,
in
terms
of
the
interest
rate
argument,
in
the
reply
brief,
this
is
the
first
time
we
had
seen
it,
i
don't
know
the
city
could
predict
interest
rates.
in
our
national
economy
we
have
the
secretary
of
treasury
saying
the
interest
rates
are
going
down,
the
council
of
economic
advisors
chairman
saying
they
are
going
up.
it
is
our
position
that
really
this
court
shouldn't
decide
that
issue
if
major
people
in
the
administration
can't
even
decide
it.
in
terms
of
what
judge
mcrea
did,
and
in
terms
of
the
consent
decree,
this
consent
decree
does
have
a
specific
purpose
as
stated
in
paragraph
17.
the
purpose
is
to
remedy
the
past
hiring
and
promotional
practices
of
the
city
of
memphis.
it
also
includes
specific
promotional
goals
and
hiring
goals.
what
the
city
proposed
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
in
fact
demote
and
lay
off
people
that
were
hired
specifically
and
promoted
specifically
because
of
that
decree.
in
exhibit
a
to
the
decree
there
are
listed
specific
promotions
that
were
to
be
made.
one
of
those
promotions
was
to
the
particular
named
plaintiff,
mr.
fred
jones.
he
was
scheduled
to
be
demoted.
there
is
nothing
in
the
consent
decree
that
puts
any
condition
upon
these
promotions.
judge
mcrea
also
looked
at
the
other
circumstances
surrounding
it.
in
paragraph
6,
again
it
states
the
purpose,
that
the
purpose
was
to
remedy
the
past
hiring
and
promotional
practices.
this
preliminary
injunction
issued
by
judge
mcrea
is
to
be
judged
on
a
standard
of
abuses
of
discretion.
in
this
case,
judge
mcrea
did
not
abuse
his
discretion.
many
of
the
blacks
who
were
scheduled
to
be
laid
off
were
hired
or
promoted
as
a
result
of
the
1980
decree.
the
consent
decree
at
no
point
authorizes
the
fire
department
to
reduce
black
representation
until
the
long
term
goal
has
been
met.
it
is
a
continuing
remedial
obligation.
it
is
the
words
of
the
consent
decree
and
not
title
7
that
governs
what
judge
mcrea's
authority
was
to
provide
this
preliminary
relief.
the
limited
relief
actually
afforded
by
the
preliminary
injunction
therefore
did
not
constitute
abuse
of
discretion.
the...
his
order
of
may
18
simply
required
that
specific
proportions
of
blacks
be
maintained
in
certain
job
classifications.
judge
mcrea
not
only
reviewed
these
job
classifications,
he
reviewed
all
of
the
proposed
layoffs
that
were
to
be
made
at
least
proposed
by
the
fire
department.
on
may
18,
no
one
knew
how
many
people
were
going
to
be
laid
off.
no
one
knew
which
job
classifications
were
necessarily
going
to
be
affected.
it
was
all
proposed
by
the
city.
what
judge
mcrea
did
was
propose
a
standard
by
which
the
city
could
come
up
with
a
layoff
policy.
at
the
later
point
when
they
submitted
their
plan,
the
city
chose
to
make
the
layoffs
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
affect
employees
as
they
stated
no
a
seniority
basis.
there
were
other
alternatives,
but
that
was
not
gotten
into
by
judge
mcrea.
he
simply
told
the
city
that
they
had
to
continue
to
fulfill
their
remedial
obligation.
by
issuing
this
narrowly
drawn
preliminary
injunction
prohibiting
the
city
from
implementing
the
proposed
layoff
policy
as
it
would
affect
the
relief
already
achieved
under
the
consent
decree,
judge
mcrea
did
not
modify
existing
provisions
of
the
decree;
he
did
not
confer
new
rights
nor
impose
new
obligations
on
the
parties,
or
take
away
any
contractual
or
seniority
rights
allegedly
enjoyed
by
nonparties.
rather,
judge
mcrea
merely
prevented
the
city
from
abrogating
the
degree
in
which
it
obligated
itself
to
raise
the
percentage
of
black
employees
in
each
job
classification.
judge
mcrea
consciously
did
not
tell
the
city
how
to
lay
off
employees.
he
consciously
did
not
involve
himself
in
the
internal
operations
of
city
employment
practices.
he
left
it
up
to
the
city
to
select
a
means
of
meeting
its
financial
obligations
without
interfering
with
this
remedial
obligation
in
the
decree.
i
would
just
like
to
make
one
other
point
about
the
united
states
position.
if
the
united
states
is
upheld,
position
is
upheld,
then
of
course
this
would,
we
believe,
and
i
think
the
eeoc
believes
in
a
footnote
to
the
justice
department's
brief,
abrogate
any
consent
decree
or
any
case
ever
being
settled.
it
would
require
full
litigation
of
every
employment
discrimination
case.
this
decree
was
settled--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--if
it
is
reasonable,
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
there
is
inherent
fairness
here,
and
they
have
participated
in
the
hearing
on
the
decree,
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
every
title
7,
where
there
is
relief
for
plaintiffs
adversely
affects
some
seniority
possibility.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
your
honor,
but
this
decree,
the
decree
we
are
working
with
and
which
this
court
has
denied
review
on
in
terms
of
its
provisions
has
a
promotional
provision
as
well.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
your
honor--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--i
don't
know.
you
have
upheld
this
decree
by
denying
cert
on
it.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
at
this
time.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
but
in
terms
of
the
victim--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--no,
they
did
not
waive
their
rights--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--the
teamsters
doesn't...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes.
no,
there
has
to
be
a
fairness
hearing
in
every
consent
decree,
and
if--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--yes,
sir,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
no,
your
honor,
we
could
enter
into
a
decree.
whether
it
would
be
considered
fair
or
not--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--oh,
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
bind
those
people
if
they
had
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
hearing
to
determine
whether
it's
fair
or
not.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
well,
if
they
participate,
in
our
decree...
and
that's
the
only
one
i
know
about
right
now...
there
was
a
hearing,
and
that
people
were
allowed
to
participate.
as
i
understand,
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
in
a
consent
decree
approval.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
the
union
did
not
stand
by
in
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
we
consented
to
its
intervention.
at
the
original
decree
entry,
the
union
i
believe
stated
in
its
brief,
along
with
the
city
in
the
prior
brief,
that
it
considers
our
consent
decree
a
reasonable
consent
decree
for
hiring
and
promotional
purposes.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
nonvictims
could...
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
they
thought.
i
mean,
you
will
have
to
a
them.
i
just
know
the
facts--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--your
honor,
obviously
they
didn't
agree
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
preliminary
injunction
hearing.
our
position
is,
though,
that--
mr.
richard
b.
fields
--your
honor,
it
never
arose
before
that.
until
the
layoffs
which
were
the
first
in
the
history
of
memphis
occurred,
this
issue
was
never
presented.
and
that
is
another
point
that
the
petitioners
present
that
we
should
have
anticipated
this
layoff.
this
layoff
was
not
anticipated
by
anyone,
and
in
fact,
as
i
stated,
in
the
history
of
memphis
there
had
never
been
a
layoff.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
if
it
were
affirmed
or
reversed,
that
would
be
the
happenstance.
i
think
after
the
boston
firefighters
case,
no
one
would
enter
a
consent
decree
without
addressing
those
issues.
but
until
layoffs
occurred,
particularly
in
the
city
of
memphis,
this
was
not
an
issue
in
this
case
or
in
any
of...
in
the
justice
department's
consent
decree
of
1974
which,
i
might
add,
if
the
justice
department's
position
today
is
upheld,
that
would
abrogate
its
consent
decree
that
it
entered
into
with
the
city
in
1974
because
its
decree
provides
for
hiring
and
promotional
goals
with
the
city
of
memphis
in
all
departments.
mr.
richard
b.
fields
yes,
that
would,
and
i
think
this
court
has
begun
to
address
that,
particularly
last
term
in
the
w.r.
grace
case
where
an
employer
enters
into
a
conciliation
agreement
with
the
eeoc,
they
may
abrogate
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
however,
you
must
remember
in
this
case
we
do
not
have
an
enforceable
collective
bargaining
agreement.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
