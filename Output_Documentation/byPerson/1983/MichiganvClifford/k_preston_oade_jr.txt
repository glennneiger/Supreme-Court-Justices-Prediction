mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
is
well
aware
petitioner
in
this
case
is,
in
effect,
asking
this
court
to
overrule
camara
versus
municipal
court
of
city
and
county
of
san
francisco,
a
1967
case,
dealing
with
warrantless
searches
of
the
physical
condition
of
premises
by
building
inspectors;
asking
the
court
to
overrule
see
versus
city
of
seattle,
a
fire
inspection
case,
1967;
asking
the
court
to
overrule
marshall
v.
barlows,
inc.,
a
warrantless
search
under
the
occupational
heath
and
safety
provisions;
and
they
are
asking
the
court
to
overrule
michigan
v.
tyler.
the
reason
that
petitioner
perceives
it
necessary
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
those
cases
is
because
whether
this
search
is
viewed
in
the
context
of
an
administrative
search
or
whether
it
is
viewed
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
search,
it
is
clear
a
warrant
was
required
under
any
case.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
these
cases
should
be
overruled.
and,
the
reason
it
need
not
reach
those
questions
is
because
clearly
a
police
officer
has
no
right
to
enter
a
private
home,
which
this
court
through
the
years
has
protected
and
drawn
the
line
that
the
threshold
of
the
home
which
the
police
officers
or
not
officials
may
enter,
absent
compelling
cause,
exigent
circumstances
for
a
warrant.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
this
case
illustrates
very
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
firefighters
had
a
duty
to
fight
that
fire
and
they
had
a
duty
to
extinguish
that
fire
and
they
had
a
duty
to
ensure
that
that
fire
was
put
out.
thereafter,
when
the
firefighters
had
left
the
scene
of
those
premises,
the
cliffords
had
their
insurance
agent
boarding
those
premises
up.
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
so
a
police
officer
will
not
enter
someone's
private
bedroom,
go
through
that
person's
closets,
go
through
the
drawers
of
their
dresser
drawers
to
see
if
there
is
any
evidence
in
there
that
they
can
convict
them
of
a
crime.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
i
can
fairly
concede
that
that
is
within
plain
view.
and,
in
fact,
in
this
case
we
have
a
plain
view
situation
and
the
plain
view
is
because
the
origin
of
the
fire
here
was
very
easily
determined
as
being
in
the
basement...
there
was
an
odor
of
flammable
liquid,
there
was
a
definite
burn
pattern
emerging
from
the
stairwell
of
the
basement
stairwell
and
there
was
a
can
of
coleman
fuel
found
in
that
basement
next
to
the
point
of
origin.
the
firefighters
found
that
can
of
fuel
and
they
took
that
can
of
fuel
and
seized
it
because
it
was
in
plain
view
and
they
put
it
outside
and
then
they
gave
a
report
to
the
arson
squad
of
probable
arson.
this
fire
is
probable
arson,
started
in
the
basement.
now,
at
that
point,
it
is
our
contention
that
it
turned
into
a
criminal
investigation
and
if
it
was
not
criminal
at
that
point
it
was
certainly
criminal
by
the
time
lieutenant
beyer,
who,
by
the
way,
i
would
like
the
court
to
know
is
a
police
officer.
lieutenant
beyer
is
a
member
of
the
detroit
police/fire
arson
squard.
his
function
is
to
investigate
criminality
and
prosecute
it
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
he
was
a
witness
in
this
case,
he
performed
their
exam,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
he
has
powers
of
arrest,
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
he
went
out
there
not
to
find
cause
and
origin,
because
he
found
cause
and
origin
in
the
basement.
he
then
went
through
this
entire
home
for
three
hours,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
it
is
very
different
in
this
sense.
the
officers
in
tyler
was
the
fire
chief,
i
believe
chief
see.
they
went
there
while
the
fire
was
still
smoldering.
when
the
fire
was
extinguished,
they
were
sure
what
the
cause
and
origin
was.
in
fact,
they
couldn't
even
see
any.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
not
sure,
justice
rehnquist,
whether
they
had
the
power
to
arrest
or
not,
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
distinguished
between
administrative
and
criminal
searches
based
on
the
objects
and
intrusiveness
of
the
search.
so,
i
submit
to
the
court,
that,
number
one,
the
object
of
the
search
was,
what,
criminal
evidence?
look
what
was
seized.
what
was
seized
here
was
old
clothes.
old
clothes
were
seized
from
the
cliffords'
bedroom
and
that
was
viewed
as
evidence
of
arson,
to
wit,
somebody
that
is
going
to
burn
their
house
down
takes
all
their
new
clothes
and
expensive
things
out
of
their
home.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
this
is
part
of
the
evidence
that
we
are
seeking
to
suppress.
so,
they
have...
they
didn't
confine
their
activities
to
cause
and
origin.
this
was
a
three-hour
search
of
this
home.
the
court
has
the
investigator's
report,
which
is
a
five-page
report...
it
is
not
in
the
appendix,
but
i
know
it
has
been
submitted
to
the
court...
that
describes
the
scope
of
this
search.
they
started
in
the
basement
and
they
found
clearly
a
crock
pot
and
a
wire.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix
and
we
had
some
confusion
in
putting
the
joint
appendix
together
as
far
as
counsel
contacting
me
and
asking
me
what
we
wanted
in
there.
it
should
be
in
the
joint
appendix
and
i
did
get
a
request
from
the
clerk
of
the
court.
i
have
sent
the
court
copies
of
the
investigator's
report.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
this
investigator's
report?
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
no.
it
was
not
marked.
it
was,
in
fact,
referred
to
by
lieutenant
beyer
throughout
his
testimony.
he
used
it
in
his
testimony.
the
transcript
reflects
that.
he
would
say
i
have
to
refer
to
my
report.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
is
not.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
has
not
been
marked
as
an
exhibit
and
put
in
for
identification.
certainly
there
is
no
question
on
the
authenticity
of
it.
the
prosecution
has
a
copy
of
it.
we
obtained
it
from
the
state.
i
believe
it
certainly
is
pertinent
and
i
have
cited
it
in
my
brief
without
objection
from
the
petitioner.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is
entirely
foreclosed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
and,
the
reason
i
don't
is
because
of
the
scope
of
the
search
itself
in
this
case.
in
the
tyler
case
i
think
it
was
limited
to
a
reasonable
search
into
cause
and
origin.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
to
the
court,
because
i
am
maintaining
that
this
is
a
criminal
investigation.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
there
was
certainly
a
criminal
investigator
present.
i
would
certainly
concede
that,
but
i
will
not
concede
that
the
focus
and
object
of
the
search
in
tyler
was
solely
to
gather
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
crime.
and,
i
think
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
scope
of
the
search
and
what
was
seized
was
fruits
and
instrumentalities
of
the
crime.
i
think
the
case
illustrates
why--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--it
does,
but--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
that
is
not
my
position.
my
position--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
they
could
not.
and,
i
would
like
to
illustrate
my
point
as
follows:
let's
suppose
they
would
have
gotten
an
administrative
warrant
to
search
for
cause
and
origin.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
warrant
is
to
limit
the
scope
of
a
search.
and,
i
believe
that
a
proper
administrative
warrant
would
have
instructed,
whether
they
be
police
officers
or
firefighters,
would
have
instructed
them
to
search
for
cause
and
origin.
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
was
in
the
basement.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
would
not
have
authorized--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--no,
i
am
not.
no,
i
am
not.
maybe
i
am
not
making
myself
clear.
let's
suppose
that
the
firefighters
in
this
case
had
stayed
at
the
scene
and
let's
suppose
that
they
had
stayed
there
for
six
hours
and
the
water
was
pumped
out
and
they
are
trying
to
determine
cause
and
origin.
if
that
happened,
and
it
didn't
happen,
but
if
it
did
happen,
and
under
tyler
they
had
a
right
to
remain
there
to
search--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--they
would
have
had
a
right
to
call
a
police
detective.
they
would
have
had
the
right
to
go
down
in
the
basement
where
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
was.
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
search
through
the
fire
debris
and
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
seize
evidence
at
the
cause
and
origin,
but
they
would
not
have
a
right,
justice
rehnquist,
to
go
in
the
man's
living
room,
to
rummage
through
his
personal
effects.
they
would
not
have
a
right--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
find
the
fact
that
is
probative
of
arson
irrelevant.
the
fact
is
they
took
it
upon
themselves
to
go
up
in
this
man's
bedroom,
to
search
their
closets,
to
search
their
dresser
drawers,
and
i
find
that
to
be
an
extreme
evasion
of
privacy
that
far
exceeds
the
scope
of
the
search.
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
had
nothing
to
do
with--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
at
least
they
would
have
an
arguable
case
that
they
were
confining
their
search
to
the
less
intrusive
means.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
clear
to
me,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
had
no
relationship
to
whatever
personal
effects
might
have
been
present
in
my
clients'
bedroom.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
will
concede
if
the
origin
of
the
fire
was
in
the
bedroom
they
had
a
right
to
be
present
in
the
bedroom.
i
don't
think
they
had
a
right
to
go
through
somebody's
diary
or
open
their
dresser
drawers
and
see
what
is
in
there.
i
don't
think
they
had
a
right
to
do
that.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
cause
and
origin
and
that
is
why
you
need
a
warrant
so
that
people
will
know,
so
police
officers
will
know,
so
arson
investigators
will
know
what
is
the
limit
of
their
authority.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
if
they
had
gotten
an
administrative
warrant
and
limited
the
search
to
the
basement.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
justice
white,
i
think
perhaps--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--that
is
true.
i
wouldn't
have
as
many
strings
in
my
bow,
but
i
would
like
to
say,
justice
white,
that
in
michigan
v.
tyler
the
michigan
supreme
court...
in
people
v.
tyler,
the
michigan
supreme
court
set
forth
a
clear
rule
for
arson
investigators
to
follow.
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
when
the
fire
has
been
extinguished,
there
is
no
danger
of
its
recurrence,
and
you
have
left
the
scene,
your
duties
are
over.
if
you
want
to
go
back
in
to
determine
cause
and
origin,
get
a
warrant.
this
court
said
in
tyler,
well,
that
took
an
unrealistic
and
narrow
view
of
the
firefighting
function.
the
court
viewed
the
re-entry
by
chief
see
four
hours
later
as
a
continuation
of
the
original
entry.
and,
justice
white,
i
think
you
said
in
tyler,
in
your
concurring
opinion,
that
that
line
of
demarcation,
the
continuation,
will
not
aid
firefighters,
it
will
confuse
them.
in
other
words,
you
predicted
that
there
are
going
to
be
situations,
because
of
this
continuation
theory,
where
firefighters
or
arson
investigators
could
have
easily
have
gotten
a
warrant
and
they
are
not
going
to
do
so
because
of
this
continuation
theory
in
michigan
v.
tyler.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
create
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
and
i
think
the
court
has
in
effect
created
an
exception
in
michigan
v.
tyler
called
the
continuation
exception.
the
exception
will
be
expanded.
the
police
and
the
firefighters
will
take
it
to
the
limits.
and,
that
is
why,
i
think,
we
are
before
this
court.
if
this
court
in
michigan
v.
tyler
had
set
down
a
clear
rule
and
said
once
you
leave
the
premises,
once
the
fire
is
out,
and
you
want
to
come
back,
then
have
an
administrative
warrant
or
have
a
probable
cause
warrant
or,
as
justice
stevens
says,
fair
notice.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
particular
legislative
standards,
and
in
the
absence
of
those
standards,
i
think
that
it
is
incumbent--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--oh,
i
believe
they
could
have.
in
fact,
lieutenant
beyer
conceded
that
he
knew
how
to
get
an
administrative
warrant.
he
said
it
could
have
taken
him
an
hour.
so,
there
was
apparently
a
mechanism
where
local
magistrates
will
allow
administrative
searches
based
on
showing
of
need
to
enter
and
a
reasonable
scope
and
search.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
a
showing
that
there
has
been
a
fire
and
it
is
of
suspicious
origin,
that
is
correct.
but,
justice
stevens,
they
had
much
more
in
this
case.
they
had--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
true.
i
think
you
should
decide
the
case
that
way,
even
though
i
take
the
view,
and
we
take
the
view,
that
this
was
a
criminal
search.
they
had
probable
cause.
they
knew
the
fuel
was
there.
when
they
went
out
to
the
house,
lieutenant
beyer
talked
to
the
neighbors,
gathered
information
that
there
had
been
a
prior
fire
there
reported
by
arson.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
they
would
have
to...
i
think
they
should,
according
to
tyler,
they
would
have
to
get
an
administrative
warrant
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--probable
cause
type
of
warrant.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
you
might
be
correct.
i
have
been
so
brainwashed
by
this
administrative
search
idea
that
perhaps
you
are
correct.
clearly,
in
any
event,
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
in
this
case
and
i
maintained
in
my
brief
that
they
could
have
gotten
a
probable
cause
warrant
and
should
have
gotten
a
probable
cause
warrant
because
they
knew
before
they
went
into
the
house
that
it
was
arson
and
they
not
only
knew
it
was
arson,
they
suspected
and
had
probable
cause
to
believe
who
had
committed
the
arson.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
in
all
likelihood
a
magistrate
would
have
issued
a
probable
cause
warrant
in
this
case.
i
can't
speculate
on
what
the
magistrate
would
have
done,
but
i
think
certainly
under
the
tests
set
forth
by
this
court
in
illinois
v.
gates,
i
think
that
there
was
probable
cause
that
there
was
evidence
of
arson
inside
that
home.
and,
of
course,
i
think
given
that
fact,
there
is
a
compelling
reason
to
require
resort
to
the
warrant.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
that
may
be
true,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
of
that,
justice
blackmun.
i
think
they
had
told
their
neighborhood...
there
was
a
boy
scout
troop.
they
were
going
up
north
with
a
boy
scout
troop,
so
i
believe
it
is
because
the
parents
wanted
to
know
where
their
kids
were
and
wanted
to
know
how
to
get
ahold
of
the
cliffords
and
their
children
up
north.
so,
i
think
mr.
mott
knew
how
to
get
ahold
of
mr.
clifford.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but,
i
think
the
main
purpose
for
a
warrant
is,
number
one,
to
limit
the
scope
of
a
search
to
a
reasonable
degree
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
case
this
was
an
intrusive
search.
it
went
far
beyond
a
determination
of
mere
cause
and
origin.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
fact
is
they
did
not
get
a
warrant.
they
should
have.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
type
of
probable
cause
that
was
submitted
to
the
magistrate
and
the
type
of
search
that
the
magistrate
would
have
authorized.
perhaps
the
magistrate
would
have
authorized
to
search
the
basement
area
and
then
when
they
found
more
evidence
of
arson,
they
could
have
come
back
and
gotten
another
warrant
to
further
enlarge
the
scope
of
their
search.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
oh,
i
think
absolutely.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
a
magistrate
has
a
duty
to--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--it
certainly
happens,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
does
happen
where
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
a
certain
area
or
a
certain
building
or
a
certain
apartment
and
then
you
make
you
search
and
based
on
what
you
find
that
gives
you
probable
cause
to
search
somewhere
else.
it
certainly
happens
there
and
it
happens
in
the
wire
tapping
area
where
you
authorize
a
search
and
you
find
something
out
and
on
the
basis
of
that
search
you
go
back
and
you
get
further
authorization.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
raised
earlier
about
exigent
circumstances.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that,
in
fact,
this
started
as
an
exigent
circumstance
case.
that
is
the
only
ground
upon
which
the
petitioner
defended
the
search
in
the
trial
court.
it
is
the
only
ground
upon
which
the
petitioner
defended
the
search
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
as
fact
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
that,
in
fact,
the
firefighters
had
completely
left
the
scene.
they
were
in
no
hurry
to
go
back.
lieutenant
beyer
had
processed
a
prisoner,
investigated
another
fire,
stopped
for
lunch,
and
he
and
his
partner
came
to
the
clifford
home.
then
they
had
to
wait
around
an
additional
half
an
hour
to
wait
for
the
water
to
go
down.
so,
they
had
ample
time,
ample
opportunity
to
obtain
a
warrant.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
that
exigent
circumstances
certainly
in
michigan
is
a
need
for
an
immediate
search.
if
there
is
a
need
for
an
immediate
search...
if
you
don't
search
now,
the
car
is
going
to
be
gone,
or
if
you
don't
search
now,
they
are
going
to
flush
the
dope
down
the
toilet,
then
maybe
that
is
an
exergent
circumstance.
but,
there
was
no
reason
for
an
immediate
search.
there
were
two
of
them
there.
they
could
have
waited.
they
could
have
posted
a
guard
and
gone
and
gotten
a
warrant
and
came
back.
they
could
have
probably
have
gotten
a
warrant
while
the
water
was
being
pumped
out.
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
for
an
immediate
search.
the
firefighters
left.
this
rekindling
thing
is
a
red
herring.
there
is
no
rekindling.
the
firefighters
had
gone.
the
fire
was
out.
if
there
was
any
danger
of
rekindling,
why
did
they
go
to
lunch
and
process
another
prisoner
and
take
their
sweet
time
in
getting
out
there?
this
wasn't
an
exigent
circumstance.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
know
that,
but
even
if
they
did,
i
don't
see
what
significance
that
has
to
exigent
circumstances.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
water
as
merely
increasing
the
time
for
them
to
go
and
get
a
warrant.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
well,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
would
like
to--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--it
said
that,
but
i
would
like
to
also
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
a
misstatement
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners
where
they
say
that
we,
in
the
lower
court,
did
not
raise
any
michigan
constitutional
grounds.
in
the
motion
to
suppress,
which
i
hope
you
have
in
the
file,
we
said
the
search
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
michigan
constitution.
when
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
said
the
search
violates
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
michigan
constitution.
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
cited
i
believe
a
total
of
seven
cases
and
most
of
those
cases
were
state
cases
and
they
were
state
cases
on
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
agree
with
that
also.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
an
exigent
circumstance.
some
emergency
compelled
them
to
leave
the
scene
and
come
back.
i
don't
think
that
any
court
would
say--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
don't
view,
justice
white,
that
the
exigent--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--i
think
that
is--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--there
is
no
exigent
circumstance.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
the
exigent
circumstance
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
fire
in
the
first
place.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
and,
the
firefighter
has
the
duty
to
determine
that.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
it
is
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
think
this
court
said
that
in
tyler.
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
tyler,
but
this
court
also
said
in
tyler--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--you
posited
a
situation
where
some
exigent
circumstance
called
him
away.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
and,
one
of
those
others
was
in
tyler
where
there
was
smoke
and
steam
and
the
firefighters
could
not
perform
that
public
duty
and
because--
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
--but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
of
an
exigent
circumstance,
because
who
came
back
were
not
firefighters
and
that
gets
to
my
earlier
point.
these
weren't
firefighters.
the
firefighters
had
ceased
to
be
involved
in
this.
they
had
extinguished
the
fire.
the
exigent
circumstance
was
over.
and,
now
they
turn
it
over
to
an
arson
squad
to
investigate
it
and
the
arson
squad
comes
out
there,
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
and
took
it
upon
themselves
to
search
this
entire
house.
and,
i
hope
this
court
will
agree
with
me
that
firefighters
or
arson
investigators
do
not
have
a
right
to
rummage
at
will
among
people's
personal
effects
in
search
of
whatever
may
convict
them
without
having
a
warrant.
firefighters
do
have
a
duty
to
investigate
fires,
but
that
doesn't
given
them
a
license
to
rummage
through
people's
personal
effects.
the
fourth
amendment
struck
the
balance
on
that
situation
in
favor
of
the
individual.
mr.
k.
preston
oade,
jr.
i
would
say
a
limited
search.
the
fire
here
was
clearly
in
the
basement.
let
them
go
in
the
basement.
let
them
determine
what
caused
the
fire,
but
keep
them
out
of
the
bedroom,
keep
them
out
of
the
dresser
drawers,
keep
them
out
of
going
through
and
searching
this
man's
badge
and
uniform
cap
and
everything
else.
thank
you.
