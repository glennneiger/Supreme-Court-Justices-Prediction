unknown
speaker
mrs.
bartee,
i
suppose
you
could
also
prevail
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
the
facts
of
this
case
fitted
within
the
exigent
circumstances
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
could
you
not?
unknown
speaker
unless,
mrs.
bartee,
the
entry
of
the
investigating
arson
squad
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
initial
entry
of
the
firefighters.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
know
whether,
in
the
jurisdiction
in
question,
the
arson
squad
would
have
visited
the
cliffords'
home
even
without
a
report
that
the
fire
was
of
suspicious
origin.
is
it
a
routine
thing?
do
they
always
go?
unknown
speaker
what
determines
whether
the
arson
squad
would
go
to
a
fire
scene?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
because
the
owner
of
the
premises
was
a
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so,
what
you
are
saying
to
me
is
that
the
arson
squad
would
have
gone
in
any
even
to
this
fire?
unknown
speaker
but,
that
might
be
suspected
that
somebody
is
after
a
policeman.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
always
some
thread
of
suspicious
circumstances
present
in
the
cases
that
the
arson
squad
investigates.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
pursue
justice
o'connor's
question.
how
do
you...
let's
put
it
this
way.
what
are
the
cases
they
do
not
investigate,
those
that
have
no
suspicious
circumstances
at
all?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
case
where
they
think
it
has
been
definitely
determined
that
it
is
arson?
won't
the
arson
squad
go
and--
unknown
speaker
--when
the
investigator
arrived
there,
there
were
still
some
of
the
post-arson,
post-fire
activity
going
on,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
they
were
still
boarding
up
the
windows
and
pumping
water
out
of
the
basement
and
cleaning
up
debris?
unknown
speaker
following
through
on
the
other
questions,
wasn't
there
a
formal
report
to
the
arson
squad
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
now,
does
the
record
show
that?
unknown
speaker
how
are
we
to
accept
it
then?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
can't
extend
a
border
search
to
an
arson
investigation,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
border
one
is
limited
to
a
border.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
is
oranges
and
one
is
apples
or
stones.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
from
the
position
you
have
suggested
that
if
the
men
who
were
working
to
pump
out
the
excess
water
out
of
the
basement
found
some
incriminating
evidence,
that
that
would
be
admissible
as
part
of
the
whole
process
of
extinguishing
the
fire
and
restoring
safe
conditions.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question
as
long
as
you
are
interrupted?
suppose
that
after
the
fire,
the
firefighters
as
they
put
it
out
or
as
they
were
pumping
out
the
water,
discovered
in
the
basement
what
appeared
to
be
to
them
an
illicit
drug
laboratory.
could
the
police
then
have
entered
six
hours
later
without
a
warrant
to
investigate
that
like
the
arson
squad
did?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
bartee,
when
you
advance
those
justification,
does
it
really
differ
much,
your
theory,
from
the
question
posed
to
you
by
justice
o'connor
that
it
could
come
within
the
exigent
circumstances,
etcetera
in
clifford?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
must
realize
you
have
a
fairly
strong
laboring
ore
to
bear
with
the
court
having
decided
the
clifford
case.
now,
your
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
indicate,
i
think,
that
the
court
wants
to
have
a
brand
new
ball
game
in
this
area
after
having
decided
clifford.
tyler.
i
am
sorry,
tyler.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry
to
have
confused
you.
unknown
speaker
which
way
does
that
cut?
unknown
speaker
and,
hence...
what
would
that
do
to
tyler?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
in
addition
to
the
exigent
circumstances
possibility,
we
have
never
said
that
every
administrative
search
needs
a
warrant.
there
are
certain
kinds
of
administrative
searches
that
fall
within
a
unique
context
and
no
warrant
is
required.
the
investigators
can
just
enter.
and,
i
would
suppose
your
position
subsumes
that
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
suppose
your
investigators
that
you
are
saying
were
legally
on
the
property,
what
if
they
had
found
the
illegal
drug
apparatus?
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
have
been
sizeable
because
they
were
legally
where
they
were?
unknown
speaker
but,
they
couldn't
tell
the
police
and
the
police
couldn't
come
in?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question?
your
exception
that
you
seek,
you
want
us
to
establish,
is
for
fire
investigation.
i
am
curious
to
know
what
you
mean
by
a
fire
investigation.
is
it
an
investigation
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
fire
or
is
it
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
was
arson?
unknown
speaker
to
prove
arson?
unknown
speaker
or
to
put
it
another
way,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
arson.
unknown
speaker
are
you
aware
that
there
are
statutes
on
the
border--
--are
you
aware
that
there
are
federal
statutes
involving
border
searches?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
have
a
federal
statute
involving
state
arson,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
mrs.
bartee,
supposing
that
al
capone
had
lived
in
detroit
rather
than
chicago
and
the
government
had
wanted
to
search
his
house
for
a
long
while
but
could
never
find
grounds
for
a
warrant.
then
all
of
a
sudden
one
day
the
police
found
out
that
his
house
had
burned.
now,
do
you
think
they
could
call
the
detroit
arson
squad
and
say,
go
over
and
search
al
capone's
house
and
see
if
you
can't
find
some
evidence
of
income
tax
violation?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
the
inquiry
is
direct
at,
to
the
cause
and
origin
of
a
fire,
and
not
to
just
any
sort
of
miscellaneous
criminal
conduct
that
the
person
might
have
otherwise
engaged
in?
unknown
speaker
you
have
got
your
eye
not
only
on
tyler,
but
camara
and
see
and
that
whole
string
of
administrative--
unknown
speaker
--you
certainly
do.
the
court
has
changed
its
mind
on
previous
occasions,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
bartee,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
i
never
know
the
michigan
practice,
on
page
83a
of
your
joint
appendix
is
something
called
"statement
of
facts
and
proceedings".
is
that
a
stipulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
in
michigan
you
call
a
stipulation
a
statement?
unknown
speaker
and,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
we
can
accept
the
facts
therein
stated
as
true
and
correct
and
i
take
it
you
are
saying
for
the
most
part,
but
not
entirely
so.
unknown
speaker
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
has
the
insurance
company
ever
paid
off?
unknown
speaker
they
are
still
what?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
take
it
your
answer
to
me
is
no.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
reasonableness
theory?
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
seem
to
agree
with
something
i
had
written
that
there
ought
to
be
notice
if
they
go
in
without
a
warrant
and
yet
there
was
no
notice
here.
so,
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
didn't
concede
yourself
out
of
court.
unknown
speaker
in
tyler,
the
point
was
to
remain,
not
to
enter.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
different.
unknown
speaker
let's
not
talk
about
rights.
do
they
have
a
duty
to
determine
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
your
example
about
the
leak,
wouldn't
that
give
you
a
whim
in
that
case
under
tyler
itself?
i
guess
i
am
repeating
justice
o'connor's
inquiry.
why
do
you
have
to
cut
back
on
tyler
to
win
this
case?
unknown
speaker
had
they
stayed
there
for
those
six
hours,
would
the
case
be
here?
unknown
speaker
i
can
frankly
say--
unknown
speaker
--will
you
let
me
speak,
please.
i
do
not
understand
your
negative
answer
to
my
inquiry.
i
said,
had
they
stayed
there
the
entire
six
hours,
would
not
the
case
be
different?
unknown
speaker
and,
had
they
stayed
there
for
six
hours,
they
still
couldn't
investigate
because
of
six
inches
of
water
in
the
basement,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
you
have
to
go
outside
tyler?
unknown
speaker
so,
even
if
they
had
arrived
and
could
do
nothing,
the
case
is
different?
unknown
speaker
how
could
the
understanding
of
the
officers
make
any
possible
difference?
it
is
very
hard
to
understand
your
argument
frankly.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you,
mrs.
bartee,
trying
to
pass
up
a
first
down
for
a
touchdown,
you
know,
by
trying
to
suggest
some
distinctions
from
tyler
which
some
of
my
colleagues
have
suggested
are
by
no
means
self
evident?
unknown
speaker
before
you
do,
i
am
still
not
sure
you
have
cleared
up
my
concern
about
the
lack
of
notice
here.
you
gave
me
hypothetical
example
of
where
we
would
not
have
needed
notice.
but,
why,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
wasn't
it
perfectly
simply
to
give
notice?
as
i
understand
it,
the
insurance...
everybody
else
gave
the
owner
notice.
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
concede
it
was
required
on
the
facts
of
tyler
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
you
would
say
the
same
thing
even
if
the
initial
entry
were
three
days
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
it
was
two
hours
after
the
water
had
been
cleaned
up
in
the
basement
instead
of
they
had
to
wait.
could
they
have
gone
in?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
responding
to
the
question,
you
may
complete,
but
then
you
have
used
up
all
your
time.
unknown
speaker
now,
some
of
the
questions,
mr.
oade...
we
are
getting
back
to
fundamentals
about
the
fourth
amendment.
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection,
the
warrant
protection?
unknown
speaker
well,
without
the
merits
of
this
case,
what
is
the
broad
purpose?
to
protect
privacy,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
in
this
place
they
had
anywhere
from
six
to
a
dozen
firemen
filing
around
the
place
for
many,
many
hours,
and
carpenters
and
whoever
the
people
were
manning
the
water
pumps.
there
had
been
quite
an
interference
with
privacy
by
that
time,
hadn't
there?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
firefighters
had
discovered,
in
the
process
of
their
work
while
the
fire
was
still
going
on,
bales
of
marijuana
or
kegs
of
heroin
and
that
sort
of
thing?
is
it
admissible?
unknown
speaker
is
that
different
than
the
officers
in
tyler?
unknown
speaker
i
meant
as
to
their
official
duties
and
the
powers
and
so
forth.
you
made
something
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
police
officer,
he
had
the
power
to
arrest.
did
the
officers
in
tyler
not
have
the
power
to
arrest?
unknown
speaker
was
all
of
that
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
is
that
report
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
because
it
certainly
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
unknown
speaker
are
you
representing
that
it
was
received
in
evidence
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr....
go
ahead.
it
is
not
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
or
it
is
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
mr.
oade,
to
get
back
for
a
moment
to
the
similarities
or
dissimilarities
between
the
officers
in
your
case
and
in
tyler,
reading
from
page
502
of
436
us,
the
court's
opinion
in
tyler,
the
first
person
to
arrive
was
chief
see,
who
i
take
it
was
the
fire
chief,
and
then
at
3:30
a.m.
he
called
police
detective
webb.
so,
there
was
a
police
detective
on
the
premises
at
all
times
after
3:30
in
tyler.
so,
i
would
think
that
your
argument
that
these
were
police
officers
rather
than
fire
officers
is
pretty
well
foreclosed
by
tyler.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
are
talking...
it
may
be
differentiated
on
the
scope
of
the
search.
i
certainly
am
not
saying
it
isn't.
but,
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
distinguish
on
the
basis
of
the
type
of
officer
who
came.
unknown
speaker
but,
if
detective
webb
was
involved
in
tyler,
there
is
certainly
every
presumption
there
was
a
criminal
investigation
in
tyler
too.
unknown
speaker
mr.
oade,
every
time
you
discover
evidence
of
arson,
it
becomes
the
fruits
of
a
crime,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
just
say
there
can
never
be
an
arson
investigation
under
any
circumstances,
that
the
exigent
circumstances
would
never
allow
that,
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
officers
were
there
at
the
time
the
firefighters
were
there,
would
you
think
they
could
have
conducted
this
same
search?
unknown
speaker
but,
don't
you
concede
under
tyler,
if
they
had
been
there
when
the
firefighters
were
there,
that
that
much
would
have
authorized
them
to
make
the
search
they
did?
unknown
speaker
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
tyler
in
another
way
then.
yes.
unknown
speaker
and,
under
tyler
they
would
have
had
a
right
to
call
a
police
detective
too.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
evidence
of
only
old
clothes
in
the
closet
is
not
probative
of
arson?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
fire
had
originated
in
the
bedroom?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
fire
had
originated
in
the
bedroom?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
suggest
it
is
only
arguable
that
they
could
go
into
the
bedroom
if
the
fire
had
originated
there?
unknown
speaker
but,
i
asked
you
what
if
the
cause
of
the
fire
had
been
found
in
the
bedroom
and
you
say,
i
believe
that
it
is
only
arguable
that
the
fire
people
could
have
gone
into
the
bedroom,
even
though
the
cause
of
the
fire
was
there.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
this
case
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
they
had
limited
their
search
to
the
basement?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
be
here
if
all
they
did
was
they
entered
without
a
warrant
and
went
down
the
basement
to
verify
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
and,
if
they
found
some
evidence
in
that
search,
you
would
still
be
here,
even
if
they
stayed
a
hundred
miles
from
the
bedroom.
unknown
speaker
can't...
yes,
you
would
be
here,
you
just
wouldn't
have
as
much
to
argue
about?
unknown
speaker
mr.
oade,
you
have
referred
to
administrative
warrants
several
times.
does
michigan
have
an
administrative
warrant
procedure
for
determining
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire?
unknown
speaker
so
at
the
time
of
this
incident,
there
wasn't
such
an
animal
that
these
people
could
have
tried
to
get?
unknown
speaker
just
a
showing
that
there
had
been
a
fire,
is
that
all
they
need?
unknown
speaker
i
know
they
had
more,
but
there
is
no
finding
of
probable
cause
here
so
i
think
we
have
to
decide
the
case
as
though
it
presents
a
question
that
might
arise
when
there
is
no
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
but,
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
there
was
suspicion
of
arson,
say,
rather
than
probable
cause
to
believe
it,
and
an
uncertain
origin
of
fire,
your
view
of
the
constitution
is
that
they
could
not
enter
at
all
or
without
an
administrative
warrant?
unknown
speaker
tyler
doesn't
talk
about
an
administrative
warrant,
does
it?
maybe
my
recollection
is
poor
about
it.
i
thought
that
talked
about
the
old
fashioned
kind
of
warrant.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
tyler
even
mentions
administrative
warrant.
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
a
magistrate
would
have
issued
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
rare
case
where,
in
a
suspected
arson
case,
a
probable
cause
warrant
wouldn't
arise,
wouldn't
issue.
unknown
speaker
this
is
totally
irrelevant,
but
i
am
curious.
i
have
done
a
lot
of
camping
in
my
day.
how
did
it
happen
the
cliffords
were
so
conveniently
available
by
telephone
on
a
camping
trip?
unknown
speaker
so,
there
were
other
youngsters
than
the
cliffords'
children?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
magistrate
had
issued
a
warrant,
as
you
seem
to
concede
he
would
have
or
any
judicial
officer
would
have,
arson
being
the
subject
of
the
inquiry,
how
do
you
think
the
search
could
be
limited?
would
it
not
be
to
inquire
into
everything
that
would
bear
upon
the
arson?
unknown
speaker
let's
just
stay
with
the
warrant
would
not
be
limited.
had
they
had
that
warrant
they
could
have
gone
into
the
closets
to
determine
what
they
did
find,
in
fact,
and
into
every
part
of
the
house
where
they
might
find
something
that
would
bear
on
the
arson,
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
do
michigan
magistrates
and
judicial
officers
issue
warrants
seriatim?
unknown
speaker
is
that
common
practice?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
a
common
practice
in
michigan?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
justification
for
getting
a
warrant,
that
there
is
time
to
get
one?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
was
because
there
was
six
inches
of
water
in
the
basement.
unknown
speaker
wasn't
the
michigan
court
basing
its
ruling
on
this
court's
holding
in
michigan
versus
tyler?
unknown
speaker
at
least
that
is
what
it
said
it
was
doing.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
people,
the
firemen
come
into
a
burning
house
and
they
put
out
the
fire.
now,
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
that
you
agree
they
could
search
around
immediately
for
the
cause.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
wasn't
in
plain
sight.
unknown
speaker
suppose
though
as
soon
as
the
fire
is
out
they
get
an
emergency...
the
chief
gets
an
emergency
call
from
another
terrific
blaze
down
the
street.
they
go
put
it
out.
and,
they
want
to
now
go
back
in
that
building
and
just
search.
they
haven't
any
reason
to
think
that
it
is
arson.
you
seem
to
agree
if
they
were
there
in
the
first
place,
even
if
they
had
no
suspicion
at
all
of
arson,
they
could
look
around
to
see
if
there
was
arson
right
on
the
spot.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
the
only
thing
is
they
couldn't
do
it
right
then
because
they
had
an
emergency
somewhere
else.
an
hour
later
they
come
back.
the
fire
is
out
and
they
are
going
to
do
precisely
then
what
they
were
going
to
do
before
except
they
had
to
go
somewhere
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
justification
for
the
search
without
a
warrant
or
even
just
a
search
for
evidence,
even
without
any
suspicion,
the
exigent
circumstance
is
what?
it
is
the
public
interest
in
knowing
what
causes
fires,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
tell
me
what
the
exigent
circumstance
is.
when
the
fireman
is
there,
he
puts
out
the
fire.
he
has
no
idea
whether
it
is
arson
or
not.
but,
you
tell
me
that
he
may
look
around
in
places
that
are
not
in
plain
sight
for
evidence
of
the
cause
of
the
fire.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
exigent
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
may
he
search
around?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so,
you
tell
me
why
may
he
look
around?
it
is
just
the
public
interest
in
knowing
what
causes
fires.
unknown
speaker
why
does
he
have
a
duty?
because
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
him
to
have
it.
unknown
speaker
and
for
him
to
discharge
that
duty
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
just
agreed
with
me
that
to
discharge
that
duty
he
doesn't
have
to
stay
on
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
a
lot
of
others.
unknown
speaker
and
here
there
was
water
in
the
basement.
unknown
speaker
if
the
arson
squad
investigators
had
just
happened
to
show
up
during
the
fire
and
entered...
and
the
fire
was
out
and
they
entered
the
building
just
when
the
fire
was
going
out.
you
would
say
the
arson
squad
could
make
a
search,
a
limited
area.
