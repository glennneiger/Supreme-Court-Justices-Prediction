mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
fifteen
years
ago
this
court
decided
the
landmark
case
of
terry
versus
ohio.
it
looked
to
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
articulate
a
promise
previously
unrecognized;
that
is
although
all
seizures
of
persons,
while
within
the
fourth
amendment,
not
every
seizure
requires
probable
cause
to
arrest
to
be
reasonable
under
the
first
clause
of
the
amendment.
today
we
ask
this
court
to
again
focus
its
attention
upon
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
recognize
that
it
contains
two
separate,
distinct,
and
coequal
clauses,
the
reasonableness
clause
and
the
warrant
clause,
and
to
hold
that
administrative
inspection
oriented
searches
fall
without
the
warrant
and
within
the
reasonableness
clause.
more
specifically,
with
regard
to
this
case,
we
are
urging
this
court
to
hold
if
there
is
a
fire
and
firefighters
must
enter
the
premises
to
distinguish
the
fire,
fire
investigators
may
also
enter
the
premises
within
reasonable
time
after
the
flames
have
been
extinguished
to
conduct
an
investigation
of
reasonable
scope
and
intensity
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
we
contend
this
initial
uncontested,
unwarranted
investigative
intrusion,
with
or
without
probably
cause,
is
justified
by
the
mere
fact
that
a
fire
has
occurred.
the
bare
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
requires
only
that
searches
and
seizures
be
reasonable
and
that
if
and
when
a
warrant
shall
issue
it
must
be
based
upon
probable
cause
to
believe
sizeable
items
will
be
found
in
the
premises,
supported
by
a
sworn
affidavit
and
particularly
describing
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
items
to
be
seized.
two
views
have
emerged
from
this
court
regarding
the
fourth
amendment
requirements.
the
prevailing
view
to
date
holds
that
a
search
warrant
is
always
required
except
when
the
facts
and
circumstances
fit
within
a
few
carefully
defined
exceptions.
this
view
focuses
upon
whether
the
failure
to
obtain
a
warrant
is
reasonable.
the
second
view
recognizes
that
this
court,
starting
with
camara,
has
forced
administrative
searches
unnaturally
into
the
warrant
clause
and
that
this
causes
serious
problems.
in
applying
the
warrant
preference
indiscriminately
to
all
searches,
rather
than
simply
applying
them
to
the
seizure-oriented
searches
as
intended,
this
court
has
been
forced
to
distort
the
concept
of
probable
cause.
it
is
our
contention,
as
is
maintained
by
the
second
view,
that
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
searches
will
not
be
unreasonable
and
that
neither
the
absence
of
a
warrant
nor
the
practicability
of
not
obtaining
a
warrant
is
dispositive
of
whether
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
violated.

the
precise
holding
by
this
court
in
michigan
v.
tyler
dealt
with
a
subsequent
entry
which
was
made
after
initial
entry
was
made
while
the
flames
were
smoldering.
the
precise
issue
before
this
court
now
deals
with
an
initial
entry
which
was
made
six
hours
after
the
flames
had
been
distinguished.

fire
investigators
investigate
approximately
130
to
160
fires
a
day.
well,
i
am
sorry,
there
are
approximately
130
to
160
fires
a
day.
they
investigate
approximately
20
of
them
and
they
do
that
in
a
priority
order
which
starts
off...
if
there
is
a
major
explosion
or
a
homicide
on
the
scene,
they
leave
wherever
they
are...
if
they
are
in
the
middle
of
an
investigation,
they
leave
and
go
to
that
site.
they
then
go
down
and
determine
what
is
priority
from
there
on.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
think
it
is
a
matter...
there
are
many
arsons
which
are
never
investigated.
it
depends
upon
the
degree
of
damage.
and,
in
this
case...
this
case
was
determined
to
be
a
priority
case
because
a
police
officer
was
involved
and
they
always
investigate
a
police
officer's
house
if
they
possibly
can.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce

that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce

that

correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
there
are
several--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--well,
there
may
be.
arson
investigators
have
several
purposes
which
makes
this
case
a
particularly
tough
case
in
that
it
is
not
purely
an
administrative
search.
it
may
have--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--those
that
have
no
suspicious
circumstances,
those
for
which
there
is
not
a
high
likelihood
of
rekindling,
those
for
which
the
cause
and
origin
is
determined
definitely,
those
that
they
can
get
to.
many
times
they
just
have
to
cut--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--what
the
firefighters
do
themselves
in
the
city
of
detroit
is
they
make
a
preliminary
determination
without
further
investigation.
and,
that
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
a
preliminary
determination,
and
they
leave
it
to
the
fire
investigators
to
follow
up
that
determination
and
find
out
for
sure.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
yes,
there
was.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
there
was
some
indication
of
that
in
the
record,
but
that
was
not
accurate.
a
formal
report
is
drawn
up,
but
the
fire
investigators
do
not
receive
that
report
until
two
or
three
days
later
and
that
as
the
firefighters
go
back
to
their
office,
compile
a
formal
report
and
sent
it
over
the
fire
investigators
when
they
are
completed.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
no,
it
does
not.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
that
the
record
indicates...
it
does
not
indicate
anything
specifically.
it
indicates
both
views.
while
the
fire
investigator
was
being
cross-examined,
he
said,
no,
we
do
not
receive
a
written
report,
yet
the
compiled
facts
indicate
a
written
report
and
that
was
sort
of
a
slip-up
and
which
i
checked
out
the
question
myself,
because
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference.
well,
it
does
make
a
difference
to
some
extent,
depending
on
what
this
court's
holding
is,
but
it
would
be
our
contention,
even
if
these
fire
investigators
entered
the
premises
with
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
cause
and
origin
was
arson,
and
with
probably
cause
to
believe
that
sizeable
evidence
of
arson
could
be
found
on
the
premises,
that
the
fire
presents
and
independent
justification
aside
from
that
to
enter
those
premises.
let
me
give
you
an
analogy
just
so
we
can
see
that
this
would
be
correct.
if,
for
example,
a
border
inspector
has
probably
cause
to
believe
that
"x"
will
be
crossing
the
border
with
a
suitcase
full
of
cocaine,
even
though
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
sizeable
evidence
of
a
crime
will
be
found
in
that
suitcase,
and
even
though
it
may
be
practicable
to
obtain
a
warrant,
no
warrant
is
required,
because
a
border
search,
which
is
made
to
protect
the
sovereignty
of
our
country,
requires
no
cause
of
warrant.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
would
like
to
analogize
the
border
situation
to
the
fire
situation
in
that
there
is
no
greater
threat
to
the
lives--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--the
fire
situation
would
be
limited
to
those
instances
where
a
fire
occurs.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
my
only
analogy
would
go
to
the
extent
that
if
probable
cause
does
exist
for
the
border
situation,
the
independent
justification
for
the
search,
which
is
the
border
search,
requires
no
warrant.
similarly,
in
a
fire...
if
this
court
accepts
that
a
fire
presents
a
situation
which
would
allow
the
fire
investigators
to
enter
and
determine
what
was
the
cause
for
this
fire,
then
the
fact
that
probable
cause
exists
cannot
defeat
that
independent
justification
for
entering
the
premises.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
the
people
that
were
on
the
premises
were
not
government
officials,
but
i
believe
if
that
was...
those
were
insurance
people,
i
believe,
and
if
that
evidence...
once
that
evidence
was
left
there
in
the
basement,
i
believe
that
should
be
admissible
evidence
as
part
of
that
first
initial
investigative
entry.
it
is--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--absolutely
not,
because
i
think
what
i
would
have
to
have
is
that
the
person
who
finds
this
evidence
is
validly
on
the
premises.
we
are
urging
this
court
to
hold
that
a
valid
purpose
for
entering
those
premises,
once
a
fire
has
occurred,
would
be
to
investigate
the
cause
of
an
origin
of
that
fire
and
to
prevent
rekindling
if
it
is
possible,
or
if
a
fire
is
rekindled,
to
put
that
rekindled
fire
out
and
to
assure
that
a
dangerous
and
volatile
situation
still
does
not
exist.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
well,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
first
reach
the
constitutional
question
and
that
is
does
a
fire
investigation
require
a
warrant?
if
this
court
follows
my
analysis,
as
is
urged,
then
this
court
would
find
a
fire
investigation
falls
within
the
reasonableness
clause
and
we
would
never
reach
the
tyler
question
and
it
would
never
have
to
determine
an
exigency.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
that
the
clifford--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--i
believe
that
the
tyler
case...
i
can
understand
justice
o'connor's
position,
but
i
believe
that
the
tyler
case
itself
dealt
with
the
initial
investigative
entry
by
the
investigators
and
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
distinction
between
the
firefighters
entering,
because
i
think
no
matter
how
you
view
that
entry,
it
has
got
to
be
justified.
the
tougher
question
comes
with
that
initial
investigative
entry.
and,
that
initial
investigative
entry
in
tyler
occurred
while
the
flames
were
still
smoldering.
and,
tyler
precisely
dealt
with
additional
entries.
in
my
case,
the
initial
investigative
entry
occurred
six
hours
after
the
flames
were
extinguished.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
well,
that
cuts
that
this
court
would
either
have
to
modify
tyler
or
this
court
would
have
to
go
with
the
more
prominent
issue
which
would
be
that
the
fire
investigation
falls
within
the
reasonableness
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
it
would
cause
this
court
to
overrule
tyler.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
our
position
is
that
the
present
day
warrant
exceptions
are
in
actuality
reasonable
searches
under
the
reasonableness
clause.
those
which
do
not
focus
on
seizure-oriented
probable
cause,
such
as
the
heavily
regulated
business,
search
incident
arrest,
inventory
search,
are
reasonable
in
light
of
the
high
governmental
interest
involved.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
that
would
have
been
in
plain
view.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
because
they
validly
invaded
that
privacy
interest
already.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
a
fire
investigation
is
an
investigation
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire.
but,
as
i
have
indicated,
there
may
be
multiple
purposes
and
one
of
the
purposes
might
be
the
seizure
of
criminal
evidence.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
if
evidence
of
arson
happens
to
be
on
the
premises,
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
to
a
fire
inspection
in
the
same
manner
which
this
court
allows
border
inspections
or
seizure
of
the
person
and
this
court
could
set
out
demarcation
of
categories--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--i
believe
that--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two,
but
not
to
the
extent
that
each
one
may
present
an
independent
justification
for
entering
the
premises.
i
believe
that
if
this
court
were
to
require
a
neutral
magistrate
to
determine
that
for
a
fire
investigator
to
go
onto
the
premises
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
a
fire,
all
that
fire
investigator
need
say
to
that
neutral
magistrate
would
be
there
is
a
fire
on
those
premises
and
we
don't
know
what
the
cause
and
origin
of
that
fire
is.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
fire
itself
would
determine
the
appropriate
scope
and
intensity
which
would
be
they
could
not
look
in
desk
drawers
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
a
fire.
i
am
not
here
to--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--i
think
the
primary
focus
is
for
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
and
if
a
search
of
inappropriate
scope
and
intensity
occurs,
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
that
would
be
a
reason
to
exclude
the
evidence.
we
believe,
which
may
be
helpful,
that
a
four-prong
analysis
should
be
undertaken
whenever
the
government
contemplates
invading
a
person's
privacy.
first,
the
reasonableness
clause
would
require
a
balancing
of
the
government's
interest
in
achieving
the
search
against
the
individual's
interest
in
privacy
to
determine
whether
the
type
or
class
of
search
is
reasonable
and
permissible.
for
example,
a
search
of
a
private
dwelling
for
criminal
evidence
is
a
permissible
class
of
search
once
the
balancing
is
applied.
a
search
of
a
private
dwelling
to
see
how
firearms
are
on
the
premises
or
to
see
what
i
can
find
about
a
crime
is
not
a
permissible
class
of
search
and
may
never
take
place.
the
second
question
then,
once
we
have
a
permissible
class
of
search,
would
be
is
the
sole
purpose
of
this
search
seizure
oriented?
if
the
sole
purpose
is
not
seizure
oriented,
then
the
third
question
simply
is
what
quantum
of
information
is
required
to
justify
this
particular
search.
for
example,
an
administrative
search
might
be
justified
by
a
legislative
scheme
which
authorizes
periodic
inspections.
the
fourth
question
then
is,
once
the
quantum
of
information
is
met
and
once
the
search
is
deemed
permissible,
the
fourth
question
would
be
what
safeguards
does
the
reasonableness
clause
require
in
order
to
insure
that
the
execution
of
this
search
is
reasonable.
once
again,
in
the
administrative
arena,
the
reasonableness
clause
might
require
prior
notice
and
no
inconvenient
time
of
execution.
now,
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
that
the
search
is...
the
sole
purpose
of
the
search
is
to
seize
items,
then
the
answer
to
the
third
question,
as
to
the
quantum
of
information,
is
always
probable
cause.
and,
the
fourth
question
would
still
apply
in
that
the
search
must
be
executed
in
a
reasonable
manner.
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
warranted
search
which
exceeds
appropriate
scope
and
intensity
is
unreasonable.
and,
i
submit
it
violates
the
reasonableness
clause
and
that
the
reasonableness
clause
requires
that
all
governmental
intrusions
be
done
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
it
is
our
contention
that
camara
and
its
progeny
recognize
that
administrative
searches
are
justified,
but
felt
compelled
to
apply
the
warrant
preference,
and
were,
thus,
presented
with
a
dilemma
of
defining
the
quantum
of
information
necessary
in
terms
of
probably
cause
in
a
situation
where
probable
cause
was
never
intended
to
apply,
and,
thus,
it
resulted
in
the
distortion
of
the
concept
of
probable
cause
and
the
creation
of
a
new
type
of
warrant.
those
who
advocate
the
primacy
of
the
warrant
have
delineated
out
two
separate
and
distinct
types
of
warrants
based
upon
the
warrant
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
first,
the
seizure-oriented
warrant
which
authorizes
a
government
official
to
go
on
to
designated
premises
and
seize
evidence
of
a
crime
or
property
to
which
the
government
has
a
superior
claim
of
possession
must
be
based
upon
probably
cause;
that
is
facts
and
circumstances
which
lead
a
reasonably
prudent
person
to
believe
that
this
sizeable
evidence
of
a
crime
or
or
property
to
which
the
government
has
a
superior
claim
of
possession
will
be
found
in
the
premises.
secondly,
the
inspection-oriented
warrant,
which
is
applicable
in
the
administrative
arena,
authorizes
a
government
official
to
go
on
to
designated
premises
and
inspect
the
condition
of
those
premises
and
determine
whether
that
condition
violates
a
regulatory
code.
this
inspection-oriented
warrant
is
necessarily
based
upon
something
less
than
probable
cause
and
may
even
be
based
upon
the
legislative
scheme
with
neutral
criterion.
it
is
our
position
that
as
stated
by
the
fourth
amendment
a
warrant
may
not
issue
but
upon
probably
cause
to
believe
that
seizeable
items--
ms.

joyce
bartee
--in
all
due
deference,
i
believe
i
do.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
and,
i
believe
this
court
changed
its
mind
before
camara
and
see
and
its
progency
came
and
that
frank
versus
maryland
existed.
and,
i
believe
that
the
goals
of
this
court
would
allow
this
court
once
again
to
look
at
this
analysis
and
determine
whether
the
constitution
does
require
a
warrant
in
the
administrative
arena.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
was
a
stipulation
in
the
lower
court,
but
i
believe...
and,
that
is
where
there
is
the
incorrect
statement
as
to
whether
a
written
report
was
received,
was
found.
however,
i
don't
believe
this
court
is
limited
to
that
stipulation
of
facts
as
the
whole
record
is
before
it.

statement
of

that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce

that
is
correct.
ms.
janice

they
are
still
calling

ms.
janice
m.
joyce

they
are
calling
me
to
find
out
the
decision
which
this
court
is
going

ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
no,
i
did
not.
i
believe
that
a
fire
investigative
search,
the
initial
entry,
does
not
require
a
warrant
or
notice
or
no
inconvenient
time
and
that
is
to
some
extent
because
of
the
exigency
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
michigan
versus
tyler.
take,
for
example,
if--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
why
this
court
would
have
to
modify
tyler.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
let
me
give
this
court
an
example.
if,
for
example,
a
gas
station
develops
a
leak
in
its
underground
tank
and
gas
seeps
through
the
soil
and
into
the
basement
of
this
house
and
flames
ignite
in
that
house,
the
extinguishing
of
those
flames
in
that
basement
does
not
extinguish
the
potentially
dangerous
and
volatile
situation
that
might
be
life
threatening
and,
therefore,
a
fire
may
rekindle
in
that
basement,
a
fire
may
rekindle
somewhere
else.
it
is
our
position
that
the
local
government
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
and
risked
lives
putting
out
fires.
there
is
no
greater
threat
to
the
property
and
residence
than
fires.
that
they
have
the
right
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
of
the
fire
and
they
have
the
right
to
determine
why
that
fire
existed
in
the
first
place
and
to
ensure
that
a
dangerous
situation
does
not
still
exist.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
to
some
extent
they
do
and
as
the
fire
marshal
is
given
the
duty
of
inspecting
every
fire
which
occurs
in
the
city
of
detroit
and
these
fire
investigators
fall
within
the
fire
marshal.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
because
i
believe
in
tyler
this
court
was
looking
at
the
investigative
entries
and
that
the
investigators
arrived
while
the
flames
were
still
smoldering.
they
were
not
looking
at
when
did
the
firefighters
arrive.
i
believe
this
case
looks
at
it
too,
the
first
initial
investigative
entry
and
this
initial
investigative
entry
occurred
while
the...
six
hours
after
the
flames
were
extinguished.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
absolutely.
had
they
arrived
when
the
flames
were
smoldering,
no.
i
think
it
is
a
matter
of
when
does
the
first
investigative
entry
occur.
i
believe
that
there
would
be
little
modification--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--there
would
be
little
modification
to
the--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--that
is
correct,
i
am
sorry.
i
was
thinking
if
they
stayed
after
the
six
hours.
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
that
is
correct.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
because
they
did
not
arrive
to
stay
there
the
six
hours.
so,
it
would
require
modification
of
tyler.
then
a
new
question--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--because
they
didn't
know
they
couldn't
do
anything
until
they
did
arrive.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
well,
because
my
argument
would
be
had
they
arrived
six
hours
after
the
flames
were
extinguished
and
they
could
have
gone
right
on
to
the
premises.
that
that
was
a
reasonable
time
for
which
to
enter
the
premises
and
that
the
investigation
could
have
occurred
without
a
warrant
if
the
investigation
is
seen
as
falling
within
the
reasonableness
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
they
couldn't
possibly...
well,
a
fire
presents
an
independent
justification
for
entering
those
premises.
let
me
apply--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--i
believe
if
you
limit
tyler
to
its
holding,
and
that
is
that
there
may
be
investigative
entries
which
can
be
deemed
a
continuous
entry,
a
continuum
of
the
initial
entry.
if
you
limit
tyler
to
its
holding,
we
do
not
fit
exactly
under
the
facts.
however,
if
you
want
to
say
that
reasonably
that
tyler
should
be
held
to
say
that
fire
investigators
may
enter
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
flames
have
been
extinguished,
then
i
believe
you
are
correct.
let
me
just
shortly
apply
my
four-prong
test
to
the
fire
situation.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
the
question
is
not
is
it
practicable
to
give
notice.
it
is
notice
required
and
i
believe--
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
--i
will
concede
for
additional
entries
it
would
be
required
unless
notice
would
defeat
the
purpose.
and,
in
an
arson
situation,
it
is
conceivable
that
notice
might
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
search.
but,
for
the
initial
investigative
entry,
i
believe
just
the
exigency
of
the
fire
itself
and
the
local
governments,
they
have
expended
money
and
risked
lives,
they
have
an
interest
and
a
right
to
determine
the
cause
and
origin
and
to
make
that
initial
entry
without
a
warrant.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
absolutely
not.
i
would
have
to
say
reasonable
time.
the
entry...
the
quantum
of
information
required,
that
is
my
third
prong,
would
be
reasonable
time
and
reasonable
time
is
not
subject
to
a
precise
definition.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
so.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
i
believe
that
reasonable
time,
to
follow
up
your
answer...
the
starting
point
for
reasonable
time
would
be
that
time
within
which
the
fire
may
rekindle,
but
it
could
not
end
within
time
within
which
a
fire
may
rekindle
because
there
may
also
be
factors
beyond
the
control
of
the
investigators
which
precludes
or
hinders
their
initial
investigation.
for
example,
in
tyler
the
steam
and
darkness
hindered
the
investigation.
it
may
be
unsafe
to
make
that
initial
investigation.
a
bulldozer
may
be
required
to
remove
some
debris
to
make
that
initial
investigation
or,
as
in
the
instant
case,
water
may
have
to
be
pumped
out
of
the
basement
to
make
that
initial
investigation.
so,
reasonable
time
would
require
several
factors.
some
of
these
factors
were
discussed
by
this
court
in
tyler
such
as
the
attempt
to
secure
the
premises,
the
continued
use
of
the
premises.
ms.
janice
m.
joyce
bartee
thank
you.
