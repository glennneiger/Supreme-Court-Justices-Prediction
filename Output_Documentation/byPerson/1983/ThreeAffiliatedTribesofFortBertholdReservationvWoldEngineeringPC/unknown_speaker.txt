unknown
speaker
mr.
cross,
i
take
it
since
you
are
appealing
from
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
it
is
your
position
that
there
is
some
federal
constitutional
principle
or
federal
statute
which
that
decision
has
violated.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
actually
read
public
law
280
to
reach
that
result?
i
thought
its
opinion
could
just
as
well
be
construed
to
mean
that
the
referendum
in
the
early
sixties
had
represented
judgment
by
the
people
of
south
dakota
that
they
did
not
want
their
courts
to
exercise
this
kind
of
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
up
to
then
it
is
all
questions
of
state
law
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
this
case
is
a
curious
one,
is
it
not,
because
here
the
tribe
is
asserting
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
and
usually
these
cases
come
up
here
in
just
the
reverse
posture.
unknown
speaker
was
your
due
process
argument
argued
below?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cross,
i
suppose
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
reach
that
if
in
fact
we
thought
that
public
law
280
was
the
grounds
on
which
the
north
dakota
court
based
its
holding
and
we
could
i
suppose
give
north
dakota
another
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
if
a
state
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe's
cause
of
action
here
what
about
wold's
counter
claim?
would
the
court
have
jurisdiction
over
that
as
well?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
there
would
be
waiver
as
a
matter
of
law
if
the
tribe
decides
to
sue
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
to
allow
the
set
off
you
have
to
adjudicate
their
claim.
unknown
speaker
you
do
concede
that
that
much
could
be
done.
on
what
theory?
it
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
jurisdictional
problem
of
a
state
court
asserting
jurisdiction
against
an
indian
tribe
over
a
claim
arising
on
the
reservation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cross,
am
i
correct
under
the
decision
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
your
people
have
no
forum
whatsoever?
unknown
speaker
those
were
cases,
were
they
not,
where
the
state
court
had
affirmatively
said
we
have
jurisdiction.
we
want
jurisdiction.
this
court
upheld
that
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
here
you
have
a
different
situation
where
i
do
not
see
those
are
necessarily
relevant
because
here
the
state
court
says
our
law
provides
that
in
the
absent
of
consent
by
the
indians
under
the
1968
revisions
of
the
public
law
280
we
are
not
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
what
you
want
is
to
have
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
take
another
look
at
the
situation
disabused
of
any
misapprehension
about
280.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cross,
may
i
ask
a
question
because
when
one
reads
the
north
dakota
supreme
court's
opinion
one
might
get
the
impression...
at
least
i
got
it
the
first
time
i
read
it...
that
they
were
just
construing
their
own
law
and
they
did
not
feel
compelled
to
construe
it
the
way
they
did
by
public
law
280.
can
i
ask
if
in
the
briefs
and
argument
before
that
court
did
your
opponent
argue
that
public
law
280
required
them
to
deny
jurisdiction
or
did
he
rely
on
north
dakota
law?
unknown
speaker
that
reading
would
be
consistent
with
yours,
but
the
former
reading
would
just
merely
authorize
if
they
decided
to
authorize
them
to
do
it.
i
suppose
they
could
have
claimed
they
had
the
authority
even
without
public
law
280.
unknown
speaker
that
was
all
before
1963.
unknown
speaker
then
they
say
that
because
of
the
1963
enactment
of
2719
which
is
a
north
dakota
statute
everything
has
changed.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
if
one
possible
thing
we
should
consider
is
perhaps
sending
the
case
back
to
that
court
and
asking
them
the
basis
of
their
decision
because
if
it
is
one
basis
then
it
presents
a
federal
constitutional
question.
if
it
is
another
basis
it
presents
a
statutory
question.
i
do
not
think
it
is
as
clear
as
you
tell
us
to
be
honest
with
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
cross,
how
about
the
statement
at
page
7a
of
the
petition
which
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
where
they
say
that
in
re
white
shield
they
are
quoting
from
and
they
say
"the
people
and
the
legislature
of
the
state
have
taken
affirmative
action
which
amounts
to
a
complete
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
which
arise
on
an
indian
reservation
except
upon
acceptance
by
the
indian
citizens
of
the
reservation
the
manner
provided
by
the
legislative
enactment.
"
they
are
not
saying
this
is
how
we
judicially
decide
something.
they
are
saying
this
is
what
the
legislature
meant.
are
you
saying
that
the
legislature
enacted
the
law
under
a
misapprehension
of
what
public
law
280
meant?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
anything
we
would
say
about
public
law
280
would
make
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
feel
differently
about
what
the
legislature
meant
by
enacting
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
it
would
take
a
new
act
of
the
legislature,
not
just
a
new
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota?
unknown
speaker
you
are
also
relying
on
decisions
of
the
north
dakota
court
subsequent
to
white
shield
or
whatever
it
is
as
far
as
280
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
would
not
our
normal
practice
be
if
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
was
wrong
in
saying
that
section
280
had
affirmatively
authorized
this
to
go
on
and
decide
for
ourselves
whether
we
thought
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
resulting
from
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota?
i
mean
we
do
not
ordinarily
remand
in
a
situation
like
that
i
do
not
believe.
unknown
speaker
how
about
section
1981?
do
you
think
that
is
applicable
if
this
court
goes
ahead
and
tries
to
solve
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
quite
state
the
question
the
same
way
in
your
brief
do
you?
unknown
speaker
which
question
do
you
think
is
before
the
court,
yours
or
the
petitioners?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mc
cutcheon.
unknown
speaker
you
feel
then
that
the
question
presented
for
review
in
the
petition,
the
one
sentence
thing,
does
not
include
the
equal
protection
argument
that
they
now
advance
in
their
brief?
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
requirements
for
us
to
consider
something.
one
is
that
it
be
passed
upon
by
the
court
below
and
the
other
that
it
be
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
or
fairly
subsumed
by
the
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
north
dakota
certainly
thought
it
was,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
answer
given
to
my
question
to
your
opposing
counsel
that
this
leaves
these
indians
without
a
forum
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
good
way
to
get
rid
of
a
law
suit
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
good
way
to
get
rid
of
a
law
suit
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
does
that
apply
to
any
other
group
of
people
in
north
dakota?
unknown
speaker
only
indians?
unknown
speaker
only
indians?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mccutcheon,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
in
gourneau
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
stated
that
it
had
overruled
white
shield.
is
that
what
you
meant?
unknown
speaker
you
emphasized
dependent
status.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
ever
expect
them
to
get
independent
status
if
they
are
free
to
be
robbed?
unknown
speaker
i
hope
you
do
not
think
my
silence
means
i
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
