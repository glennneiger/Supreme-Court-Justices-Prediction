mr.
raymond
cross
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
a
unique
issue.
does
public
law
280
authorize
a
state
to
absolutely
bar
actions
against
non-indians
by
indians
if
they
arise
on
an
indian
reservation?
this
matter
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
affirming
the
state
district
court's
dismissal
of
petitioner's
negligence
and
breach
of
contract
action
against
respondent
wold
engineering.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple.
petitioner,
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
known
as
the
three
affiliated
tribes,
employed
wold
engineering
to
construct
a
water
supply
system
on
the
fort
berthold
indian
reservation
in
northwestern
north
dakota.
the
project
known
as
the
four
bears
water
project
was
intended
to
provide
a
water
supply
from
lake
sakakawea
to
a
portion
of
the
reservation
population.
however,
after
completion
of
the
project
in
1977
defects
were
discovered
in
that
system
that
prevented
the
accomplishment
of
that
objective.
despite
attempts
at
correction
by
wold
engineering
of
the
system
petitioner,
three
tribes,
commenced
their
negligence
and
breach
of
contract
action
in
the
state
district
court
for
the
northwestern
judicial
district
of
north
dakota.
at
trial
in
1982
wold
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
on
the
grounds
that
the
federal
law
prohibited
state
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
the
trial
court
agreed
on
the
grounds
that
the
three
tribes
failed
to
consent
to
public
law
280
civil
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
in
favor
of
the
state
and
on
that
ground
dismissed
petitioner's
action.
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
construing
a
state
statute,
chapter
2719,
which
is
included
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
as
evidencing
the
state
legislature's
intent
to
disclaim
any
jurisdiction
over
the
matter
until
the
indians
consented
to
public
law
280
jurisdiction
in
the
civil
area.
the
court
noted
in
the
course
of
its
decision
which
is
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
cert
that
state
judicial
jurisdiction
had
extended
to
these
actions
against
non-indians
by
indians
prior
to
the
enactment
in
1963
of
chapter
2719.
on
that
basis
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
tribe's
action
against
wold
engineering.
only
two
sections
of
public
law
280
are
involved
in
this
matter,
section
6
and
section
7.
under
that
jurisdictional
classification
scheme
north
dakota
is
a
so-called
optional
state
and
a
disclaimer
state
meaning
that
under
section
7
it
must
take
appropriate
action
to
amend
its
state
constitution
to
remove
the
federal
disclaimer
imposed
in
its
admitting
act,
and
secondly
under
section
7
of
public
law
280
it
must
enact
affirmative
legislation
assuming
jurisdiction
under
section
7.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
right,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
the
state
court
misconstrued
public
law
280
in
holding
that
it
prohibits
state
court
jurisdiction
over
actions
of
this
sort.
mr.
raymond
cross
your
honor
justice
rehnquist,
the
decision
itself
indicates
plainly
that
the
state
court
regarded
judicial
jurisdiction
of
the
state
as
extending
to
these
actions
before
the
enactment
of
the
state
statute
involved
under
the
authority
of
public
law
280.
the
sole
source
of
the
authority
reading
it
either
as
an
authorization
or
as
compelling
the
state
legislature
to
take
that
action
is
the
source
of
that
disclaimer.
so
taking
a
look
at
the
state
judicial
history
under
the
state
constitution
and
under
the
course
of
state
judicial
declaration
the
state
had
judicial
jurisdiction
over
these
actions
prior
to
that
enactment.
that
enactment
was
explicitly
taken
under
section
7
of
public
law
280
and
consequently
it
concerns
the
question
of
federal
interpretation.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
justice
blackmun.
it
is
a
surprising
case
in
the
sense
that
the
indian
people
here
are
asserting
the
right
as
citizens
the
rights
that
they
have
in
common
with
other
members
of
the
state
to
sue
in
state
court.
so
the
constitutional
question
that
is
at
stake
is
that
assume
that
public
law
280
was
lifted
out
of
this
context
and
that
this
action
was
taken
solely
as
a
matter
of
state
law
would
that
violate
equal
protection
and
due
process
rights
of
the
indian
people
involved.
mr.
raymond
cross
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
our
position
is
this
is
that
the
state
statute
is
based
on
a
misconstruction
or
on
a
construction
of
public
law
280
and
that
raises
a
federal
law
question
that
is
appropriate
for
resolution
by
this
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
since
the
plaintiff
here
is
a
tribe,
the
tribe
according
to
decisions
by
this
court
has
sovereign
immunity.
it
may
be
provided
for
in
contracts
that
that
can
be
waived.
of
course,
to
the
extent
of
a
set
off--
mr.
raymond
cross
--well,
as
a
matter
of
law,
justice
o'connor,
wold
engineering
can
recover
to
the
extent
of
a
set
off.
they
claim
a
small
amount
of
money
is
due
them
under
the
contract,
some
$4500.
that
would
be
available
to
them
as
a
set
off
against
the
tribe's
claim.
the
question
of
an
affirmative
counter
claim
or
claims
that
might
arise
present
a
tougher
question.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
to
that
limited
extent.
mr.
raymond
cross
your
honor,
based
on
the
state
court
decision
below
they
did
not
differentiate
between
claims
by
tribal
members
or
claims
by
tribes.
based
on
their
reading
both
of
the
state
law
and
of
public
law
280
they
did
not
make
a
distinction
in
that
regard.
if
there
were
a
distinction
to
be
made
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
court
below
on
remand,
but
here
in
the
decision
they
made
no
distinction
between
the
rights
of
the
tribe
to
sue
in
state
court
nor
am
i
certain
they
could
but
in
fact
they
did
not.
the
state
court
decision
below
established
a
simple
proposition:
either
the
indian
tribes
consent
to
public
law
280
civil
jurisdiction
or
they
are
barred
from
suing
non-indians
in
state
court.
public
law
280
has
been
enacted
for
over
30
years
now,
and
the
decisions
by
this
court
make
clear
that
there
is
no
legal
or
factual
connection
between
suits
against
non-indians
and
public
law
280.
it
is
possible
to
give
quite
a
full
account
of
what
the
meaning
both
in
the
plain
terms
and
the
legislative
history
of
public
law
280
is
in
the
light
of
recent
decisions
by
this
court
most
notably
kennerly
v.
district
court,
washington
v.
yakima
indian
nation
and
bryan
v.
ithasca
county.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
in
the
course
of
those
decisions
that
i
mentioned
this
court
has
construed
the
application
of
public
law
280
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
in
cases
of
non-p.
l.
280
in
mcclanahan
v.
arizona
state
tax
commisson,
in
cases
where
the
states
assumed
full
p.l.
280
jurisdiction
in
bryan
v.
ithasca
county
and
in
cases
where
the
state
has
assumed
partial
jurisdiction
in
washington
v.
yakima
indian
nation.
in
each
of
those
cases
this
court
has
construed
the
plain
terms
and
the
legislative
intent
of
public
law
280
as
being
remedial
in
nature,
and
by
this
i
mean
that
congress
intended
to
correct
problems
on
the
reservation
both
in
the
criminal
and
in
the
civil
jurisdictions.
in
bryan
v.
ithasca
county
this
court
provided
that
the
state
if
they
assume
civil
jurisdiction
may
adjudicate
cases
between
indians
even
as
between
indians
and
may
apply
their
state
law
to
govern
those
actions.
consequently
in
this
court's
decisions
construing
public
law
280
there
is
no
indication
that
preexisting
rights
of
indians
were
terminated,
and
this
court
in
a
course
of
decisions
over
the
last
hundred
or
more
years
has
indicated
that
indians
have
the
right
to
seek
the
aid
of
state
courts
and
state
statute
in
protecting
their
property
against
intrusion
by
non-indians.
justice
lamar
in
choit
v.
trap
at
224
u.s.
665
said
that
indians'
rights,
their
private
rights,
are
enforced
to
the
same
extent
and
in
the
same
way
as
other
residents
or
citizens
of
the
united
states.
that
decision
came
in
the
context
of
indians
enforcing
their
federal
tax
exemption
in
state
court.
the
power
the
indian
people
have
to
sue
in
state
court
to
protect
their
property
rights
has
been
exercised
on
a
number
of
occasions,
first,
in
a
decision
in
1857
fellows
v.
blacksmith
19
howard
this
court
affirmed
a
state
court
order
ejecting
non-indians
from
tribal
lands.
this
court
likewise
indicated
that
the
states
may
seek
the
aid
of
state
statute
in
new
york--
mr.
raymond
cross
--that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
however,
that
decision
turns
on
an
interpretation
of
public
law
280.
the
decision
below
clearly
states
that
the
court
feels
that
the
state
legislature
was
disclaiming
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280.
consequently,
the
question
arises
does
public
law
280,
not
state
law
authorize
a
bar
against
these
sorts
of
actions?
i
think
it
is
clear
that
in
the
construction
of
public
law
280
this
court
has
said
that
state
legislations
enacted
under
that
authority
cannot
be
construed
as
termination
or
abrogation
of
preexisting
rights.
in
bryan
v.
ithasca
county
this
court
held
that
civil
jurisdiction
granted
under
statute
was
for
a
very
limited
purpose,
and
it
was
not
intended
to
indicate
that
the
state
had
broader
authority
beyond
the
terms
of
that
act
to
tax
indian
property.
consequently
if
there
was
a
negative
reading
of
public
law
280
so
that
the
state
felt
compelled
to
disclaim
jurisdiction
outside
of
public
law
280
that
is
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
federal
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
justice.
in
the
context
of
the
situation
where
the
state
assumes
no
public
law
280
jurisdiction
this
court
has
still
recognized
that
the
indians
have
access
to
state
courts
for
actions
arising
on
reservations.
in
mcclanahan
v.
arizona
state
tax
commission
this
court
is
deciding
an
issue
of
whether
the
state
of
arizona
may
tax
indian
income
said
that
indians
have
access
to
state
courts
to
sue
non-indians
citing
the
case
of
felix
v.
patrick
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
secondly,
in
that
same
case
this
court
indicated
that
the
states
have
a
recognized
interest
in
regulating
non-indian
conduct
citing
surplus
trading
co.
v.
cook.
consequently
it
is
clear
that
the
preexisting
jurisdictional
rules
and
relationships
outside
of
the
plain
terms
of
the
act
and
what
the
intent
of
the
act
was
were
not
disturbed.
in
other
words,
if
the
indians
were
recognized
as
having
access
under
state
law
to
state
court
and
if
the
state
took
the
position
they
had
the
authority
to
regulate
non-indian
conduct
on
reservations
as
north
dakota
did
before
the
enactment
of
chapter
2719
under
public
law
280
it
would
seem
that
that
jurisdictional
relationship
was
not
disturbed.
mr.
raymond
cross
as
i
read
the
appellate
record
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
the
position
taken
by
respondent
was
that
public
law
280
authorized
the
state
to
enact
chapter
2719
and
disclaim
jurisdiction
that
it
previously
claimed
or
in
the
alternative
that
public
law
280
was
the
nature
of
a
preemptive
statute
which
by
a
negative
reading
precluded--
mr.
raymond
cross
--that
would
raise
a
different
issue.
that
issue
would
be
raised
in
the
context
of
a
state
policy
barring
indians.
the
legal
history
of
north
dakota
that
is
reviewed
in
our
brief
indicates
and
repeated
declarations
of
the
supreme
court
that
indians
along
with
other
state
citizens
are
entitled
to
sue
in
state
court.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
was
before
1963.
mr.
raymond
cross
our
expectation
is
that
when
this
issue
is
clarified
by
the
supreme
court
on
the
construction
of
the
public
law
280
or
the
federal
law
issue
that
the
prior
declarations
that
was
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law
and
federal
constitutional
rights
that
the
indians
do
have
access
to
state
courts
for
actions
arising
on
reservations
is
the
proper
policy
they
would
follow.
a
recent
decision
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
entitled
poitra
v.
demarrias
indicates
that
is
how
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
repeated
declarations
of
the
state
supreme
court.
in
that
context
they
were
called
on
to
decide
whether
a
substantial
state
policy
would
be
infringed
if
diversity
jurisdiction
was
allowed
in
the
indian
case
that
arose
on
a
reservation.
they
found
that
the
declarations
of
the
state
supreme
court
indicated
no
such
policy.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct,
justice.
that
would
be
one
option
to
clarify
the
underlying
basis
of
the
decision.
i
do
feel
that
based
on
the
prior
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court
the
eigth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
poitra
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
sole
basis
for
decision
was
federal
law.
i
do
admit
that
there
could
be
some
ambiguity,
but
i
do
not
see
it
either
in
the
record
or
in
the
state
court's
decision
below.
mr.
raymond
cross
justice
rehnquist,
that
action
was
taken
under
section
7
of
public
law
280
and
the
action
that
was
taken
by
the
state
legislature
and
embodied
in
the
state
statute
was
construed
by
the
supreme
court
as
being
affirmatively
authorized
legislation
under
section
7
of
public
law
280.
the
question
then
becomes
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
is
that
the
sort
of
legislation
that
was
contemplated
by
public
law
280
and
the
congress
that
enacted
it?
i
do
not
see
any
indication
that
there
is
an
independent
policy
or
basis
for
that
decision.
mr.
raymond
cross
i
think
that
if
the
legislature
and
the
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
state
supreme
court
conflicts
with
public
law
280
that
they
would
take
what
this
court
has
to
say
very
seriously
indeed.
mr.
raymond
cross
no,
i
am
saying,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
statute
as
construed
by
this
court
since
it
is
under
the
authority
of
a
federal
law
and
a
function
of
the
delegated
power
would
take
on
a
new
aspect
to
that
court.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
cross
that
is
correct.
there
were
decisions
subsequent
to
that
statute
and
that
decision
that
indicated
that
indians
do
have
access
to
state
courts
for
certain
purposes.
that
is
the
case
of
white
eagle
v.
dorgan,
the
tax
case
involving
the
authority
of
the
state
to
tax
certain
income
on
reservations.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
