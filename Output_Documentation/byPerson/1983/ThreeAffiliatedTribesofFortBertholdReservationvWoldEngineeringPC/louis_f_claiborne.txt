mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
perhaps
most
usefully
could
begin
by
addressing
justice
stevens'
concern,
that
is,
the
exact
basis
on
which
to
the
extent
that
we
can
discern
it
from
its
opinion
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
rested
its
judgment.
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
end
of
that
opinion
which
is
at
page
10a
of
the
petition
appendix.
the
court
is
here
addressing
and
very
conscious
of
the
constitutional
problem
both
under
the
state
constitution
and
under
the
federal
constitution.
it
would
arise
if
the
state
courts
were
closed
to
indians
in
this
discriminatory
way
absent
special
authorization
by
the
congress
for
that
closure.
the
court
concludes
its
opinion
by
saying
after
discussing
this
constitutional
problem
and
saying
that
it
does
not
stand
as
an
impediment
to
their
result.
quoting
from
this
court's
opinion
in
the
yakima
case
and
in
the
words
of
the
north
dakota
court,
"likewise
the
people
of
north
dakota
and
the
legislature
were
acting
under
explicit
authority
granted
by
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
federal
power
over
indians
when
our
constitution
was
amended
and
chapter
2719
of
the
north
dakota
code
was
enacted.
"
"we,
therefore,
find
no
equal
protection
violation
of
the
constitution
of
either
the
state
or
the
united
states,
and
for
the
reasons
stated
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
"
it
seems
to
us
plain
that
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
was
resting
its
judgment
that
no
constitutional
violation
either
of
its
own
or
of
the
federal
constitution
was
involved
only
because
they
construed
public
law
280
as
having
authorized
not
as
public
law
280
does
authorize
an
assumption
of
new
jurisdiction
but
a
disclaimer,
a
repudiation
of
preexisting
jurisdiction.
if
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
were
disabused
of
that
misreading
of
public
law
280
every
indication
is
that
the
court
would
then
find
that
there
was
no
justification
under
either
its
own
constitution
or
under
the
federal
constitution
for
uniquely
closing
the
courts
of
the
state
to
indian
plaintiffs
whether
the
tribe
or
individual
members.
for
that
reason
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
disposition
is
to
remand
the
case
to
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
with
a
construction
of
public
law
280
which
we
have
argued.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
we
do
not
oppose
the
suggestion
that
if
the
federal
constitutional
question
is
as
plain
as
we
think
it
is
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it
and
accordingly
to
reverse
the
judgment
without
need
for
any
further
proceedings
except
for
trial
of
the
contract
claim
in
the
district
court
of
north
dakota.
our
suggestion
is
simply
that
as
a
matter
of
deference
to
the
state
court
this
court
might
think
it
more
appropriate
to
afford
the
highest
court
of
the
state
an
opportunity
to
correct
its
own
error
without
the
misapprehension
which
led
it
into
that
error
rather
than
a
simple
reversal,
but
it
is
really
not
for
us
as
a
mere
amicus
in
the
case
to
be
suggesting
in
any
strong
way
what
the
appropriate
disposition
is.
we
ourselves
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
absence
of
any
federal
authorization
for
discriminating
against
indian
plaintiffs
the
federal
constitution
would
require
north
dakota
to
admit
them
to
its
courts.
we
likewise
assume
from
what
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
itself
has
said
that
the
state
constitution
would
require
that
result,
and
if
there
is
a
state
constitutional
ground
it
might
be
appropriate
to
afford
that
court
an
opportunity
to
revoke
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
seem
to
us
that
section
1981
may
well
be
applicable.
however,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
as
far
as
i
am
aware
that
ground
was
not
argued
below,
and
accordingly
it
might
be
particularly
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
reach
that
question.
we
simply
mention
it
as
one
more
indication
of
the
problem
that
is
created
by
this
misreading
of
public
law
280.
as
to
that
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
public
law
280
was
intended
in
its
own
words
under
section
6
to
remove
impediments
to
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction,
not
to
erect
new
impediments...
no
license
is
given
for
that...
and
to
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction,
not
a
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction.
likewise
section
7
is
clear
in
that
it
gives
federal
permission
to
states
not
having
jurisdiction
over
certain
categories
of
claims
involving
indians
to
assume
jurisdiction,
not
to
repudiate
previously
existing
jurisdiction.
i
may
say
that
the
north
dakota
amendment
to
its
constitution
itself
suggests
no
direction
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
to
repudiate
any
previously
existing
jurisdiction.
on
the
contrary,
all
that
happened
in
1958
is
that
the
people
of
that
state
in
response
to
public
law
280
and
with
in
a
way
that
on
its
face
seems
unobjectionable
said,
"we
retain
our
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction
over
indian
lands
provided,
however,
that
the
legislature
may
accept
such
jurisdiction
as
is
delegated
by
act
of
congress.
"
that
in
no
way
to
us
suggests
any
repudiation
of
preexisting
jurisdiction,
and
indeed
the
1963
act
of
the
state
legislature
speaks
of
jurisdiction
being
extended
to
cases
involving
indians,
nothing
about
disclaiming
or
repudiating
older
jurisdiction.
because
those
statutes
and
constitutional
amendments
read
in
that
way
it
is
and
must
be
inviting
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
to
reconstrue
those
statutes
which
are
perfectly
able
to
be
read
as
consistent
with
public
law
280
in
that
way
once
this
court
has
indicated
that
public
law
280
did
not
authorize
any
repudiation
of
old
jurisdiction.
of
course,
it
is
possible
to
argue
that
notwithstanding
public
law
280
the
states
might
be
free
to
disclaim
quite
independently
of
any
federal
authorization
of
jurisdiction
over
indians,
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
made
it
clear
that
there
is
no
federal
obstacle
to
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
by
an
indian
against
non-indians
within
the
state
at
least
in
the
absence
of
any
tribal
court
which
has
asserted
that
jurisdiction
and
certainly
not
when
the
tribe
itself
is
the
plaintiff.
there
can
be
no
arguable
conclusion
into
the
tribal
self-government
when
the
tribe
is
the
plaintiff
as
is
here.
the
irony
of
this
case
is
that
the
claim
of
tribal
self-government
and
infringement
is
made
by
the
non-indian
defendant,
not
by
the
tribe
itself.
it
is
a
case
where
the
defendant
is
being
more
roman
than
the
romans.
the
preexisting
law
before
public
law
280
in
this
court
and
in
the
state
courts
was
quite
clear
that
states
could
assume
jurisdiction
over
this
sort
of
claim
by
an
indian.
in
the
absence
of
any
federal
impediment
to
the
assumption
of
that
jurisdiction
we
as
we
have
suggested
see
a
serious
equal
protection
constitutional
obstacle
to
declining
to
exercise
that.
