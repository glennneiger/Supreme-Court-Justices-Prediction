mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
may
i
take
a
moment
to
restate
the
question
which
i
thought
was
today
before
this
court.
in
petitioners'
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
the
question
presented
was
did
the
state
trial
court
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
decide
a
cause
of
action
brought
by
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
against
a
non-indian
defendant
regarding
a
matter
arising
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
indian
reservation.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
i
am
trying
to
point
the
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
i
think
our
question
and
this
question
are
fairly
close
and
are
before
the
court,
but
what
has
happened
that
i
think
that
this
question
has
galloped
around
in
the
various
briefs.
i
was
and
possibly
i
should
not
do
it...
i
thought
i
would
try
and
bring
it
back
to
the
question
as
it
existed
on
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
by
showing
the
distinction,
but
it
is
easy
to
find
the
distinction
if
the
court
will
simply
recognize
that
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
certiorari
application
they
stated
the
question.
there
are
some
extraneous
words
in
it
that
should
be
stricken,
but
when
that
is
done
it
comes
basically
back
to
the
petitioners'
question,
and
in
our
brief
on
the
same
point
the
certiorari
the
question
there
then
comes
very
close
to
what
i
have
outlined.
then
it
begins
to
deviate,
and
in
the
petitioners'
brief
on
the
merits
the
questions
presented
which
presumptively
to
me
mean
the
issues
there
are
now
three
different
questions
set
out.
number
one
is
not
in
this
proceeding
at
all
in
my
judgment.
number
two
should
be
carved
of
extraneous
language
to
bring
it
somewhat
within
the
question
upon
which
we
think
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted,
and
number
three
should
be
also
reworked
because
we
now
get
into
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses.
let
me
say
this
that
those
clauses
were
argued
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court,
and
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
did
reach
those
issues.
then
that
issue,
however,
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
so
we
do
feel
that
the
question
should
be
restated,
and
finally
in
connection
with
the
final
brief
served
upon
us
which
is
the
petitioners'
reply
brief
we
do
not
agree
with
the
statement
made
in
the
first
sentence
that
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
petitioners
that
there
is
only
a
sole
issue.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
yes,
sir.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
however,
in
all
fairness
it
was
raised
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court.
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
did
go
to
it--
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
--it
was
reached
by
the
court
below,
but
i
believe
that
there
has
been
extraneous
or
extra
material
now
brought
into
this
argument.
let
us
turn
for
a
moment
to
some
of
the
argument
advanced
by
both
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
counsel
for
the
government.
the
argument
seems
to
be
made
that
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
was
incorrect
in
its
conclusion
and
specifically
that
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
should
have
recognized
that
it
had
prior
jurisdiction.
what
counsel
for
the
petitioners
is
arguing
today
is
that
280
did
not
bar
a
prior
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
a
court,
but
that
presumes
something.
this
court
has
stated
many
times
in
these
cases
that
the
jurisdiction
must
be
conferred
by
an
act
of
congress.
now
until
280
which
this
court
has
said
in
several
recent
cases...
i
believe
you
said
it
just
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
the
new
mexico
v.
mescalero
apache
case...
that
280
was
the
first,
not
the
second,
but
was
the
first
grant
of
power
of
general
applicability
with
respect
to
this
type
of
a
matter.
now
if
you
said
it
it
must
be
so.
you
have
said
it
in
other
cases,
and
we
certainly
accept
that
and
why?
for
one
reason.
we
do
not
find
that
north
dakota
has
ever
been
given
outside
of
an
indian
act
in
the
middle
forties
any
grant
of
power
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
our
courts
to
assume
jurisdiction.
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
old
jurisdiction
because
if
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
it
was
not
conferred
upon
them
then
there
would
be
no
prior
jurisdiction
that
could
spring
back
into
existence
or
if
not
springing
back
into
existence
would
have
remained
in
existence.
it
was
never
there
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
yes,
but
north
dakota
was
wrong
and
north
dakota,
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
and
they
were
wrong
under
the
test
in
williams
v.
lee.
now,
let's
if
we
may
go
to
north
dakota.
a
few
moments
ago
the
matter
of
the
white
shield
case
was
raised.
i'm
sorry
let's
go...
let
me
change
my
argument
just
a
moment.
public
law
280,
1953.
five
years
later,
1958,
north
dakota
through
its
people
amended
its
constitution
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
280.
that
is
the
legislative
history.
five
years
after
that
in
1963
north
dakota
adopted
the
legislation
through
its
legislature
to
further
implement
the
matters
and
that
is
now
found
as
27-19
of
the
north
dakota
century
code.
five
years
after
that
congress
enacted
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
1953,
1958,
1963,
1968.
now
what
north
dakota
did
because
the
indians
asked
for
it
when
north
dakota
in
1963
adopted
chapter
27-19
of
the
century
code
they
did
what?
they
put
in
a
consent
clause.
they
said
this
jurisdiction
which
we
are
imposing
at
this
time
becomes
effective
when?
upon
consent
by
the
indians
through
an
election.
we
preceded
the
indian
civil
rights
act
in
that
respect
by
five
years.
now
go
to
the
north
dakota
cases.
in
1957
there
was
the
case
of
vermillion
v.
spotted
elk,
and
our
court
there
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
in
that
our
court
was
in
error.
our
court,
however,
subsequently
in
in
re
white
shield
said
in
effect
we
were
wrong
in
that
case,
and
in
re
white
shield
our
court
said
this
and
in
re
white
shield
is
in
1963.
here
is
what
our
court
said,
"however,
by
the
amendment
of
section
203
of
the
north
dakota
constitution
and
the
passage
of
chapter
244
of
the
session
laws
of
1963.
"
--which
is
now
27-29
of
the
century
code...
"the
people
and
the
legislature
have
taken
affirmative
action
which
amounts
to
a
complete
disclaimer
of
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
which
arise
on
an
indian
reservation
except
upon
acceptance
by
the
indian
citizens
of
the
reservation
in
the
manner
provided
by
the
legislative
enactment.
"
then
the
constitutional
amendment
is
set
forth.
following
in
re
white
shield--
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
--yes,
sir,
i
do,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
discriminatory
in
any
manner
because
it
is
my
belief
from
the
cases
that
i
have
read
of
this
court
where
this
court
says
that
is
not
racial
discrimination
and
this
court
goes
so
far
in
one
case...
i
don't
recall
the
name
of
the
case
right
at
the
moment...
as
to
answer
that
precise
question
and
it
says
"there
will
be
times
when
there
will
not
be
a
forum.
"
this
court
has
said
that,
but
they
said
that
is
not
an
invidious
discrimination.
that
is
simply
because
of
the
situation,
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
particular
type
of
legislation
with
these
particular
people
who
occupy
a
different
status
from
anyone
else.
furthermore
this
court
has
said--
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
--i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
sir,
jurisdiction
can
always
be
accepted.
we
have
all
stood
ready
since
1958
to
have
jurisdiction
of
our
courts
fully
extended
over
the
reservations.
the
keys
to
the
courthouse
are
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
at
least
in
north
dakota.
they
are
right
there.
all
they
must
do
is
have
an
election.
now
our
statute
does
have
certain
provisions
on
an
election.
those
provisions
are
probably
possibly
invalid.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
law
suit
because
i
think
congress
has
said
how
the
election
shall
be
conducted,
called
and
so
forth
so
probably
to
that
extent
those
election
provisions
of
our
statute
would
fall
as
procedural
but
the
point
remains
the
power
and
authority
is
there.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
no,
sir.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
280.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
yes,
sir.
then
in
gourneau
which
was
a
subsequent
1973
case
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
expressly
stated
they
have
overruled
in
re
white
shield.
the
arguments
have
been
probably
quite
well
covered,
but
we
must
remember
that
280,
public
law
280
itself,
is
not
an
act
that
bars
jurisdiction.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
i'm
sorry.
no,
sir.
i
did
make
a
mistake,
spotted
elk.
we
conclude
that
vermillion
which
is
vermillion
v.
spotted
elk
no
longer
states
the
rule
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
state
courts
have
jurisdiction.
now
this
court
has
indicated
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
preemption
doctrine
applies.
this
court
has
also
stated
and
it
was
well
stated
in
new
mexico
v.
mescalero
apache
that
the
preemption
doctrine
is
not
quite
the
same
as
a
normal
preemption
doctrine.
the
normal
preemption
doctrine
would
simply
be
that
something
is
supreme
and
there
would
be
no
alternative.
this
court
has
extended
that
because
it
has
said
that
there
are
exceptions
and
certain
of
those
exceptions,
for
example,
are
tax
cases.
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
where
the
courts
may
have
some
jurisdiction.
it
was
interesting
to
note
that
petitioners'
counsel
referred
to
the
case
of
something
versus
dorgan.
true,
a
north
dakota
case
cited
in
1973.
it's
a
tax
case,
but
in
that
case
our
court
said...
and
the
facts
were
stipulated
incidentally...
our
court
said
that
our
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
civil
causes
of
action
with
respect
to
the
indian
reservations.
our
court
is
now
very,
very
consistent.
this
court
has
not
too
long
ago
in
one
of
the
cases
stated
that
tribal...
yes,
rice
v.
rehner...
that
tribal
sovereignty
itself
exists
at
the
suffrance
or
pleasure
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
this
court
has
also
stated
the
present
policy
of
congress
which
is
to
try
to
bring
the
indians...
this
is
the
policy
of
280...
to
try
to
bring
the
indians
into
the
full
mainstream
of
our
society.
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
280
as
i
understand
it.
certainly
the
states
do
appear
to
be
working
for
that.
the
mandatory
states
under
280
were,
what,
granted
instant
jurisdiction.
the
disclaimer
states
were
required
to
remove
an
impediment
to
the
assumption
of
that
jurisdiction,
but
again
assumption
in
that
sense
means
exactly
what
the
act
seems
to
say.
it
is
the
assumption
of
any
jurisdiction.
in
north
dakota
it
would
be
the
assumption
of
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance.
there
were
acts,
for
example,
in
minnesota
which
i
understand
did
grant
certain
jurisdiction,
certain
congressional
acts,
but
none
in
north
dakota
and
in
reviewing
all
of
these
cases
it
is
necessary
to
draw
the
distinctions
with
respect
to
certain
state
situations.
for
example,
candelaria,
a
1926
case,
is
advanced
in
the
brief
of
petitioners
and
the
government,
but
go
back
to
1919
and
look
at
the
case
of
pueblo
santa
rose
which
is
mentioned
in
candelaria
and
it
tells
you
from
whence
came
the
power
of
those
courts.
the
power
of
those
state
courts
came
from
treaties
with
mexico
and
spain,
and
they
were
carried
forward
into
the
law
and
they
were
carried
forward
into
the
state
law
by
act
of
congress,
by
requirement
of
congress.
the
same
is
true,
for
example,
with
some
of
these
states,
for
example,
in
the
area
of
oklahoma,
arkansas
and
so
forth.
north
dakota
had
a
territorial
government.
oklahoma,
some
of
those
states
did
not
have
an
organized
territorial
government.
there
were
certain
laws
in
the
unorganized
territory
that
were
created
by
congress,
certain
courts
that
were
created
by
congress,
and
in
statehood
that
followed
those
were
required
to
be
carried
forward
into
the
state
laws.
we
have
varying
situations,
but
in
north
dakota
there
has
never
been
a
prior
grant,
a
specific
prior
grant
of
authority
from
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
wails
the
authority
in
these
instances
for
a
special
people
who
have
a
different
relationship
than
others.
the
test
has
always
been
as
stated
in
williams
v.
lee
whether
there
is
any
infringement
upon
the
basic
rights.
north
dakota
has
met
all
requirements
set
forth
by
280.
we
took
those
step
by
step.
we
did
it
by
a
vote
of
the
people.
we
amended
our
constitution.
we
acted
by
our
legislature
and
we
have
taken
the
procedural
steps
required
by
public
law
280.
in
yakima,
washington
v.
yakima,
the
matter
there
was
washington
having
taken
or
having
set
full
jurisdiction
over
eight
subject
matter
areas,
and
the
attack
there
was
made
you
couldn't
do
it.
you
had
to
take
either
all
or
none,
and
this
court
said
no,
you
have
the
power
to
take
the
whole.
you
may
take
the
lesser,
and
that
does
make
logic.
there
have
been
challenges
to
280,
but
280
has
withstood
those
challenges.
it
now
requires
that
which
we
took
five
years
before
1968
the
consent
of
the
indians.
the
doctrine
of
conceptual
clarity
which
existed
in
the
days
of
150
years
ago
in
the
winchester
v.
georgia
case
where
it
simply
said
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
there
except
that
which
was
granted
by
congress,
and
it
was
totally
exclusive.
the
state
might
not
enter.
that
has
been
modified.
there
are
some
exceptions
now
to
that
particular
doctrine,
and
that
is
rather
stated
carefully
in
new
mexico
v.
mescalero
apache.
it
basically
comes
back
to
three
areas
that
indian
tribes
have
been
implicitly
divested
of
their
sovereignty
in
certain
respects
by
virtue
of
their
dependent
status,
that
under
certain
circumstances
a
state
may
validly
assert
authority
over
the
activities
of
nonmembers
on
a
reservation
and
that
in
exceptional
circumstances
a
state
may
assume--
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
--yes.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
sir,
i
do
not
believe
they
are
free
to
be
robbed.
i
believe
that
they
must
be
encouraged
to
seek
the
independent
status,
and
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
280.
at
least
that
appears
to
be
the
congressional
intent
for
them
to
seek
to
become
or
give
or
provide
an
opportunity
for
them
to
become
full
fledged
members
in
this
society.
perhaps
the
thrust
of
congress
is
that
they
are
not
dependent
members.
mr.
hugh
mc
cutcheon
sir,
i
am
used
to
having
judges
disagree
with
me.
i
did
not
feel
that
you
were
disagreeing,
your
honor.
oh
yes,
one
thing
further
with
respect
to
this
counter
claim.
the
argument
advanced
in
the
supreme
court
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
was
in
response
to
sharp
questions
by
our
court
with
respect
to
the
counter
claim
was
that
well
that
could
be
treated
as
an
offset
against
the
judgment
that
we
are
going
to
get.
well,
now
wait.
i
seem
to
have
remembered
in
all
the
years
that
i
have
been
in
and
out
of
the
court
room
that
someplace
in
some
book
somewhere
i
read
where
a
plaintiff
did
not
recover
on
his
suit
and
the
defendant
did
recover
on
the

i'm
sorry?
mr.

mc

because
it
is
not
yet
established
that
the
plaintiff
can
recover
a
judgment.
in
summation,
i
would
point
out
only
that
280
is
an
act
conferring
jurisdiction
in
the
first
instance
original
authority
for
jurisdiction
to
be
exercised
by
the
states;
that
north
dakota
has
properly
followed
all
steps
that
are
strictly
required
of
our
state
in
so
doing;
that
we
have
placed
all
of
the
machinery
in
existence
subject
only
to
the
consent
of
the
indians;
that
the
judgment
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
