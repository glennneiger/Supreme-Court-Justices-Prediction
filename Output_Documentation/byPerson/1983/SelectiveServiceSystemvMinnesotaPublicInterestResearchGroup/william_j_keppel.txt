mr.
william
j.
keppel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
you
today
is
whether
the
constitution
will
countenance
now
and
for
the
future
the
use
of
leverage
of
a
statutory
benefits
program
to
enforce
an
unrelated
penal
statute.
approval
of
the
scheme
under
challenge
here
will
sanction
the
use
of
a
test
oath
as
a
law
enforcement
device
contrary
to
the
basic
principles
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
section
1113
substitutes
a
presumption
of
guilt
for
that
of
innocence.
it
reverses
the
historical
burden
of
proof.
it
imposes
a
punishment
without
judicial
trial.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
repayment
of
a
loan,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
at
least
related
to
the
payment
of
other
obligations.
the
statute
that
is
under
scrutiny
here
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
higher
education
act
benefits
programs
which
are
far-reaching
indeed,
and
for
that
reason
that
hypothetical
is
different
from
the
case
before
you.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
repayment
of
the
loan,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
in
itself
a
crime.
non-registration,
on
the
other
hand,
is
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
by
up
to
five
years
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
or
both,
and
so
the
difference
between
many
of
those
kinds
of
conditions
if
they
are
bona
fide
and
rationally
related
to
the
goal
of
the
congress
is
a
different
thing.
in
addition,
if
the
underlying
act
is
a
criminal
act
in
itself,
that
carries
us
one
further
away
from
the
case
here.
the
consequences
of
your
decision
then
will
extend
far
beyond
this
case.
if
section
1113
survives
scrutiny,
it
will
be
followed.
indeed,
it
has
already
been
followed
by
a
rash
of
similar
laws
by
which
government
on
all
levels,
federal,
state,
and
local,
will
demand
citizens
to
swear
or
certify
under
pain
of
perjury
in
return
for
some
form
of
government
benefit
that
they
have
not
broken
one
law
or
another.
these
laws
not
only
undercut
the
judicial
system,
but
they
serve
as
an
affront
to
the
dignity
and
the
integrity
of
our
citizens.
fortunately
the
constitution,
through
its
bill
of
attainder
clause,
through
the
proscription
on
self-incrimination,
and
through
its
guarantee
of
equal
protection,
does
not
tolerate
laws
such
as
1113.
section
1113
violates
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder.
it
targets
a
clearly
identifiable
group.
it
imposes
punishment,
and
it
does
so
without
the
protections
of
a
judicial
trial.
section
1113
accomplishes
this,
as
i
mentioned,
through
the
device
of
a
test
oath
by
which
the
applicant
for
aid
must
certify
under
pain
of
perjury
that
he
has
complied,
he
has
submitted
to
registration
under
section
3
of
the
selective
service
act.
and
in
addition,
as
is
true
of
the
classic
test
oath
cases,
the
conduct
here
is
perceived
by
some
to
be
disloyal
or
at
least
politically
unpopular.
in
spite
of
the
government's
protestations,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
three
of
the
elements
or
requirements
to
proscribe
the
statute
as
a
bill
of
attainder
are
met
here.
this
statute
clearly
focuses
on
non-registrant
students
who
need
financial
aid.
in
footnote
29
of
the
brown
case,
the
court
said
that
as
long
as
you
can
ascertain
a
group
that
is
the
focus
of
a
statute...
in
that
case
they
cited,
for
example,
a
statute
with
regard
to
operating
machinery.
if
you
can
describe
symptoms,
or
if
you
can
describe
a
disease,
or
some
other
guideline
by
which
the
group
could
be
ascertained,
that
is
sufficient.
here,
the
statute
itself
identifies
a
group,
and
there
is
no
question
but
that
who
is
within
its
proscription.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
affidavit
of
robert
kusenko
and
the
brief
of
the
amicus
group
of
colleges
headed
by
the
university
of
minnesota
indicates
that
about
80
percent
of
all
financial
aid
money
is
federally
funded
and
comes
within
this
statute.
in
addition,
anywhere,
depending
on
the
program,
from
two-thirds
to
three-quarters
of
the
students
fall
within
families
who
have
total
family
income
of
$18,000
or
less,
which
is
considerably
less
than
the
average
family
income
for
the
country.
and
so,
while
we
can't
define
exactly
the
numbers
who
would
fall
within
it,
we
can
see
that
it
is
a
high
percentage
of
students
and
the
funds
available
to
students
generally
are
overwhelmingly
the
federally
financed
funds
under
title
4.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
justice
o'connor,
this
court
has
indicated
that
inescapability,
and
that
is
the
rubric
that
the
government
uses
in
describing
what
you
are
talking
about,
inescapability
is
not
required.
footnote
32
in
the
brown
case
makes
it
clear
that
this
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
finding
an
ascertainable
or
identifiable
group.
it
is
merely
one
factor
that
might
be
considered.
but
in
this
case
the
government
agrees
that
the
act
of
non-registration
is
complete
upon
the
expiration
of
a
30-day
period
after
attaining
one's
18th
birthday.
now,
whether
they
forebear
from
prosecuting
or
not
is
not
the
point,
but
the
past
and
ineradicable
act
exists
upon
the
expiration
of
that
time
period,
and
so
any
of
these
people
could
be
prosecuted
at
any
time
if
the
government
changed
its
policy.
and
during
the
late
sixties
and
the
early
seventies,
the
government
did
in
fact
prosecute
late
registrants,
so
i
think
we
can
see
that
this
is
an
identifiable
group.
the
crime,
if
you
will,
is
complete.
the
past
act
is
complete.
the
inescapability
is
not
a
prerequisite,
and
so
the
group
is
clearly
identifiable.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
in
the
manner
required
is
not
a
literal
interpretation.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
my
clients,
your
honor,
do
not
fall
within
the
group
of
people
who
are
unaware
of
their
obligation
to
register,
and
so
with
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
hanging
over
them
because
the
government
has
been
careful
not
to
grant
immunity
to
late
registrants,
with
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
hanging
over
them,
it
would
not
be
in
their
best
interest.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
there
is
no
question
but
that
they
are
adversely
affected.
there
is
no
hearing
available
to
them.
there
is
no
redress
available
to
them
but
to
attack
the
statute
itself,
and
whether
they
have
standing
to
attack
late
registration
or
not,
it
seems
that
they
would.
in
fact,
one
of
the
appellees
contacted
me
about
a
month
ago
and
said
he
couldn't
continue.
the
economic
pressures
were
too
great.
he
had
to
register.
and
so
these
people,
if
the
government
can
leverage
them
enough,
can
coerce
them
enough,
can
be
compelled
not
only
to
violate
their
fifth
amendment
rights,
but
to
violate
their
conscience
and
register.
for
that
reason,
they
would
have
standing.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
there--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--the
statute
in
that
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
evenhanded.
it
applies
to
all.
it
does
not
have
a
law
enforcement
purpose,
which
section
1113
does.
you
can
call
it
an
economic
incentive,
but
you
can
also
use
other
euphemisms.
i
think
i
would
more
accurately
describe
it
as
a
penalty
for
non-compliance,
and
i
think
that
is
one
distinguishing
feature,
that
the
statute
which
you
describe
or
the
contractual
obligation,
if
it
is
one,
is
at
least
evenhanded.
this
one
is
directed
to
non-registrants
to
coerce
their
registration,
and
for
that
reason
the
situations
would
be
different.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
yes,
the
draft
was
in
effect
at
the
time,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
by
the
same
token,
that
provides
the
argument
that
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
their
present
forebearance.
once
this
case
is
decided,
the
government
could
go
ahead
and
start
prosecuting
late
registrants,
or
if
the
international
conditions
changed
as
you
describe,
the
government
could
decide
to
prosecute.
and
these
people
who
did
so
would
be
susceptible
to
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
were
outspoken
critics
of
government
policy,
even
though
they
late
register,
the
government
would
always
have
that
club
hanging
over
their
head
by
which
it
could
prosecute
outspoken
critics,
and
i
think
as
long
as
they
are
unwilling
to
grant
immunity,
which
they
could
do
if
they
were
serious,
as
long
as
they
are
unwilling
to
grant
immunity,
the
potential
for
criminal
prosecution
is
clear.
now,
the
second
requirement
of
a
bill
of
attainder
is
that
it
inflict
punishment.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
in
prosecutions
for
non-registration,
justice
marshall,
and
that
has
been
extended,
as
the
government
notes
in
its
reply
brief
to
five
years
after
one
attains
his
26th
birthday.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
effect
on
these
young
men
could
be
viewed
as
longlasting,
and
certainly
beyond
the
statutory
period,
because
their
college
degrees
are
being
terminated
with
the
termination
of
their
aid.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
and
that
criminal
prosecution--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--potential
ceases
five
years
after
attaining
the
26th
birthday.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
would
be
leverage
far
less
drastic
than
is
the
leverage
here.
these
people
are
cut
off
from
financial
aid
which
the
district
court
found
clearly
was
required
for
them
to
proceed
with
their
college
education.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
in
this
case,
they
are
required
to
certify
themselves.
they
are
required
to
confess
to
late
registration,
if
you
will,
in
the
certification.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
this
court
has
noted
that
punishment
has
to
be
determined
in
the
context
of
the
particular
case.
in
this
case,
we
see
a
drastic
penalty
or
sanction
inflicted
on
these
non-registrants.
the
situation
which
you
describe,
while
a
matter
of
degree,
is--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--it
is
less
money,
but
it
also
has
a
far
less
drastic
impact
on
the
young
men,
because
they
may
not
be
penalized
by
$50,
but
when
you
are
cutting
them
off
completely,
we
are
talking
about
quite
a
different
matter.
we
have
to
remember
that
we
are
not
only
talking
about
college
students
and
university
students.
the
higher
education
act
covers
technical
schools,
vocational
schools.
it
covers
direct
student
loans,
even
the
guaranteed
programs...
grants,
state
incentive
loans.
it
even
covers
the
work-study
programs
by
which--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--if
it
targets
an
identifiable
group
and
if
it
inflicts
punishment--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--i
would
consider
that
very
close
to
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
absent
the
self-incrimination
problem
that
we
have
also
in
section
1113.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
it
would
in
my
judgment,
justice
rehnquist.
this
court
has
held
that
punishment
need
not
be
directly
inflicted.
what
cannot
be
accomplished
directly
cannot
be
accomplished
indirectly,
and
deprivation
under
any
form,
however
disguised,
is
prohibited
by
the
bill
of
attainder
law.
and
so,
consequently,
in
the
cummings
case
over
100
years
ago
the
court
held
that
deprivation
of
any
civil
right
or
political
right
may
be
punishment,
and
they
looked
at
disqualification
from
positions
of
trust,
from
pursuit
of
certain
vocations,
from
being
a
guardian
or
an
executor
was
a
sufficient
punishment,
even
disqualification
from
federal
employment.
we
are
not
cutting
in
the
lovett
case
off
these
individuals
from
any
kind
of
employment.
all
we
are
saying
is,
you
can't
work
in
the
federal
government,
and
that
was
sufficient.
from
practicing
law
in
the
federal
courts
in
the
ex
parte
garland
case,
not
forbidding
you
from
practicing
law
in
state
courts,
or
writing
wills,
or
closing
real
estate
transactions,
but
merely
practicing
in
the
federal
courts.
and
all
of
these
were
viewed
to
be
sufficient
penalties.
in
this
case,
we
are
cutting
these
young
men
off
from
proceeding
with
their
college
degrees,
which
the
district
court
held
could
only
be
done
with
federal
aid,
and
by
not
attaining
the
college
education
in
this
increasingly
complex
society,
we
are
cutting
these
young
men
off
from
any
number,
not
only
of
learned
educations
but
any
number
of
skilled
pursuits
or
vocations
under
the
technical
and
vocational
school
reach
of
this
statute.
and
that
inflicts
punishment
in
a
real
sense
perhaps
far
more
extensive
than
in
the
previous
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
punishment--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--it
can
be
avoided,
chief
justice,
by
registering,
but
this
court
has
also
held
that,
in
cases
like
spevack,
that
the
ability
to
obtain
other
kinds
of
work
or
the
like
cannot
be
imposed,
and
furthermore,
in
grasso
and
marketti,
the
court
said
it
is
not
whether
these
young
men
have
a
right
to
register
or
not
to
register,
but
once
having
chosen
not
to,
whether
they
can
be
compelled
to
incriminate
themselves,
and
contrary
to
what
the
government
suggests,
this
is
not
a
separate
or
this
is
not
a
combined
argument.
the
bill
of
attainder
stands
separate
and
independent
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
as
the
government
keeps
urging
and
urging
that
late
registration
qualifies
you
for
aid,
we
get
further
and
further
into
fifth
amendment
problems,
because
by
late
registering,
they
are
confessing
to
having
late
registered,
and
are
providing
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
which
may
be
used
to
convict,
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
held
to
be
sufficient
to
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
i
have
no
reason
to
quarrel
with
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
probability
today
is
quite
low,
but
as
i
mentioned,
late
registrants
have
been
prosecuted
in
the
past.
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
suggests
that
it
may
be
changing
its
policy
with
regard
to
late
registrants
who
are
registering
after
they
get
warning
letters
from
the
selective
service
system
and
as
they
can
change
that,
they
can
get
back
to
the
policy
that
they
were
practicing
back
in
the
late
sixties
and
early
seventies.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
please,
i
missed
the
question.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
i
am
aware
of
no
such
situation.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
there
have
been
a
number
of
them
in
the
last
few
years.
not
a
large
number,
but
they
have
prosecuted
non-registrants.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
yes.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
is
true.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
waiver
of
the
privilege
would
not
get
him
federal
aid.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
compulsion
is
in
their
need
for
financial
aid.
they
need--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--the
scheme
of
section
1113
is
part
of
the
reason
why
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
the
student
is
faced
with
the
cruel
trilemma
of
either
foregoing
financial
aid,
of
committing
perjury
in
falsely
certifying
compliance,
or
in
waiving
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
in
those--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--but
for
this
section,
which
has
been
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
he
would
get
aid.
these
young
men,
all
six
of
them,
received
federal
financial
aid.
they
qualified
for
federal
financial
aid
before
section
1113
was
enacted,
and
but
for
that
section,
they
would
be
receiving
it
today.
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
you
cannot
enforce
an
unconstitutional
condition
as
a
requisite
for
receipt
of
aid,
whether
it
be
a
federal
job
or
some
other
benefit.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
compulsion
is
that
they
need
the
aid.
they
have
to
have
the
aid
to
continue,
and
that
is
important
enough
a
price
to
pay,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
spevack
versus
klein
case,
too
costly
a
price
to
give
up
your
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
so
it
is
that
leverage
or
coercion
or
compulsion
based
on
need
that
renders
the
argument
that
this
is
a
voluntary
application
to
be
really
begging
the
question.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
justice
white,
we
do.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
it
is
indeed.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
as
long
as--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--and
that's
what
they'd
be
doing.
they'd
be
signing
their
confession
when
they
signed
the
certification
of
compliance
or
non-compliance,
or
if
they
left
it
blank.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
looking
at
the
fifth
amendment
problem
as
one
in
which
invoking
one's
right
to
remain
silent
makes
the
price
that
is
paid
too
costly,
as
this
court
held
in
spevack--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--if
there
is
immunity,
there
is
no
problem.
if
they
will
grant
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
white.
as
they
argue,
late
registration
is
permissible
for
bill
of
attainder
purposes.
the
case
of
self-incrimination
becomes
stronger.
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
they
have
to
select
one
or
the
other.
now,
the
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
as
i
stated,
is
not
cured
by
late
registration,
and
under
any
of
the
tests
of
the
cases
cited
both
by
the
government,
the
garrity,
the
lefkowitz
cases,
the
spevack
cases,
the
price
paid
in
cutting
off
financial
aid,
in
terminating
college,
in
hampering
or
perhaps
terminating
the
pursuit
of
one's
chosen
vocation
is
too
costly
to
make
the
imposition
or
the
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
context
here.
this
court,
as
i
said,
in
torasco
versus
watkins,
wyman
versus
updegraff,
held
that
unconstitutional
conditions
in
the
award
of
public
employment
or
in
the
holding
of
public
office
cannot
stand,
and
for
them
to
say
consequently
that
we
can
use
unconstitutional
conditions
to
bootstrap
their
fifth
amendment
argument
again
is
unsuccessful.
given
the
increasingly
pervasive
reach
of
government
into
virtually
all
of
our
lives,
in
the
increasing
numbers
of
federal
jobs,
of
loans
and
grants
and
licenses,
permits,
employment
the
decision
in
this
case
will
have
far-reaching
consequences.
if
the
court
approves
this
scheme
reflected
in
section
1113
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
federal
government
from
conditioning
any
aid
or
any
contract
or
job
of
any
kind
on
a
test
oath
affirming
registration
not
only
for
the
draft
but
affirming
non-violation
or
compliance
with
any
penal
criminal
statute.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
that
fact
will
be
known
to
the
government.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
in
the
application
itself,
you
do
not
disclose--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--that
you
have
registered.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
you
are
still
susceptible
to
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
william
j.
keppel
the
document
itself
does
not
contain
a
date,
but
the
verification
procedures
in
section
1113
will
quickly
uncover
the
fact
of
late
registration,
and
again,
it
is
late
registration
itself
that
might
be...
might
qualify
one
for
financial
aid
but
which
is
clearly
an
independent
crime
which
cannot
be
cured
in
the
context
here
without
the
grant
of
some
kind
of
immunity.
and
so
if
this
scheme
is
approved,
there
is
nothing
not
only
to
stop
the
federal
government
but
to
stop
state
governments
from
conditioning
benefits,
such
as
the
driver's
license,
the
attendance
at
any
state
school,
occupational
licenses--
mr.
william
j.
keppel
--thank
you.
