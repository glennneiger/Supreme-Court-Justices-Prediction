unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
is
the
dimensions
of
this
problem?
how
many
have
not
registered
who
are
eligible
to?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
total
number
who
have
registered?
unknown
speaker
why,
mr.
solicitor
general,
did
congress...
is
there
any
indication
in
the
history
why
did
they
want
the
registration
without
the
actual
authority
to
draft?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know,
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
many
of
that
350
to
380,000
who
have
not
registered
are
receiving
financial
aid?
unknown
speaker
or
are
asking
for
it?
unknown
speaker
general
lee?
unknown
speaker
i
notice
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
were
all
anonymous.
did
the
government
make
any
objection
to
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
view
in
the
same
way
a
statute
that
provided
that
no
loan
applicant
would
be...
receive
aid
if
he
owed
any
delinquent
taxes
to
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
let
me
try
this
hypothetical.
suppose
there
were
a
provision
in
the
medicaid
or
medicare
act...
i
get
the
two
of
them
confused...
either
one
of
them,
that
if
a
physician
was
seeking
to
participate,
that
is,
to
charge
fees,
that
he
would
have
to
certify
under
oath
that
he
had
repaid
any
student
loan
that
he
may
have
had
to
get
his
medical
education.
would
you
think
that
would
be
the
same
pretty
much
as
the
case
before
us
today?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
what
percentage
of
all
applicants
to
colleges
in
minnesota,
if
that
is
the
relevant...
are
eligible
for
financial
aid?
i
mean,
is
it
a
small
percent
or
a
large
percent?
unknown
speaker
do
those
statistics
show...
perhaps
you
have
answered
it
and
i
just
didn't
get
it...
what
percentage
of
the
applicants
for...
the
ratio
perhaps
the
people
who
would
be
eligible
for
these
federal
funds
bear
to
the
total
number
of
applicants
for
admission
or
the
total
number
of
people
admitted?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
isn't
a
class
an
open...
certainly
as
applied
to
people
who
are
becoming
18?
now
they
are
aware
of
the
provisions
of
the
draft
registration
law
and
aware
of
the
financial
aid
requirements,
and
as
to
them
it
is
just
a
requirement
for
future
conduct,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
would
it
not
be
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
to
treat
it
the
way
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
that...
in
accordance
with
means
and
the
manner
required
by
rather
than
within
the
time
required?
wouldn't
that
eliminate
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
be
in
the
best
interests
of
your
clients
to
so
construe
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
they
wouldn't
register
anyway?
i
wonder
if
they
have
standing
to
make
the
particular
argument
you
are
making
then.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
about
a
person
who
had
been
convicted
of
some
criminal
act
and
in
prison
and
then
a
fugitive,
escaped
from
the
prison,
that
had
a
pension
due
him
either
from
the
government
or
from
some
private
source.
make
it
the
government.
he
would
certainly
have
some
disincentive
to
apply
for
his
pension,
would
he
not,
because
that
would
identify
him?
would
you
say
there
is
some
violation
there
of
his
rights?
unknown
speaker
he
has
to
show
up
in
order
to
get
the
benefit.
but
if
he
shows
up
he
is
going
to
be
apprehended
as
a
fugitive
and
put
back
in
prison.
unknown
speaker
you
referred
to
the
act
as
it
was
in
the
sixties,
i
think
you
said
the
seventies
also.
was
that
a
registration
in
connection
with
a
draft
potential,
or
was
it
just
a
pure
registration
as
it
is
now?
in
other
words,
was
the
draft
in
effect
in
the
sixties?
unknown
speaker
that
makes
it
somewhat
different,
doesn't
it?
there
would
be
a
reason
for
prosecuting
non-registrants
who
were
not
only
evading
the
registration
requirement
but
also
evading
the
draft
itself.
unknown
speaker
one
question.
what
about...
you
say
forever
this
is
there?
no
statute
of
limitations
involved?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean,
you
keep
saying
forever.
you
don't
really
mean
that.
you
mean
five
years.
unknown
speaker
i
am
only
talking
about
prosecution,
criminal
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
five
years.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
would
you
have
difficulty
if
the
government
just
gave
an
outright
financial
grant
of,
say,
$50
a
person
to
get
people
to
register
for
the
draft?
i
mean,
that
is
some
kind
of
leverage,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
grant
program
operated
the
same
way,
and
they
are
cut
off
from
the
outright
grant
if
they
don't
register,
how
is
that
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
your
self-incrimination
argument.
what
about
the
bill
of
attainder
argument?
is
that
offended
by
a
grant?
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
less
money,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
take
justice
o'connor's
example
a
point
further.
supposing
congress
were
to
say
that
we
are
sufficiently
concerned
with
failure
to
register
for
the
draft
that
we
are
going
to
channel
all
aid
to
higher
education,
which
formerly
went
into
the
higher
education
act
in
the
form
of
scholarship
grants
to
people
who
register
for
the
draft
after
they
get
out
of
the
army,
if
they
ever
do.
and
so
the
only
aid,
federal
aid
to
higher
education
is
available
to
you
only
if
you
register
for
the
draft
under
that
act.
now,
would
that
pose...
would
you
feel
that
would
come
under
your
argument,
or
that
it
would
be
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
ask
you
to
answer
a
question
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
so
you
feel
that,
too,
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
punishment
that
can
easily
be
avoided,
can
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
punishment
as
you
describe
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
do
you
disagree
with
the
basic
figures
as
i
understand
the
other
side
to
give
us
that
there
have
been
300,000
or
400,000
people
who
have
been
late
registrants,
and
none
of
them
have
been
prosecuted?
unknown
speaker
so
the
probability
of
prosecuting,
getting
prosecuted
for
a
late
registration
is
really
quite
low.
unknown
speaker
has
anyone
ever
been
prosecuted
when
there
was
just
a
registration
requirement
without
a
draft
system?
unknown
speaker
has
anyone
ever
been
prosecuted
for
failing
to
register
except
when
there
was
a
draft
system
extant?
unknown
speaker
there
have
been
prosecutions
for
failure
to
register,
haven't
there,
in
different
jurisdictions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
are
you
about
to
address
your
privilege
argument?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this?
do
i
correctly
understand
the
statute
that
he
doesn't
get
aid
if
he
refuses
to
certify
that
he
has
complied
with
the
registration
requirement.
that
is
true,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
also
true
that
if
he
were
to
say,
i
waive
my
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
i
admit
that
i
have
not
registered,
would
he
not
also
be
denied
any
aid?
unknown
speaker
then
my
question
is,
where
is
the
coercion
in
this
scheme,
the
compulsion
to
force
students
to
waive?
unknown
speaker
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
admit
or
refuse
to
say
whether
they
have
registered,
in
both
cases,
they
would
be
denied
aid,
how
does
the
scheme
work
with
compulsion?
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
it,
if
he
waives
by
admitting
that
he
has
not
complied,
he
is
not
going
to
get
any
aid
anyway.
unknown
speaker
if
this
statute
said,
if
you
will
waive,
you
will
get...
and
admit
that
you
have
not
complied,
you
will
get
the
aid,
i
can
see
the
compulsion
then
of
the
provision,
but
if
he
is
not
to
get
it,
at
least
as
to
this
scheme,
it
is
difficult
to
see
where
the
government
compulsion
is
for
purposes
of
the
privilege.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keppel,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
first
part
of
your
argument,
and
say
that
late
registration
is
permissible
under
the
statute?
is
the
case
over
then?
you
still
have
a
fifth
amendment
issue,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
situation,
if
he
says,
no,
i
have
not
registered
but
i
want
to
register
now
in
order
to
get
the
aid,
your
fifth
amendment
argument
is
still
there,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
justice
brennan's
question
would
be
answered,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
could
get
the
aid,
as
long
as
they
registered--
unknown
speaker
--and
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
admitting
that
they
were
late.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
agree
with
that
construction
of
the
statute,
the
violation
of
law
has
dissipated.
there
is
no
violation
of
law,
as
soon
as
he
registers,
so
where
is
the...
you
know,
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
the
price
is
zero.
you
comply
with
the
law
and
you
have
no
penalty.
what
is
the
price?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words
your
argument
fails
if
the
statute
is
construed
the
other
way.
your
compulsion
is
a
compulsion
to
comply
with
the
law,
not
to
say
anything.
maybe
your
bill
of
attainder
argument
might
fail,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
still
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
a
crime,
for
having...
failing
to
register.
even
if
they
accept
late
registration.
as
long
as
you
register,
you
get
the
aid.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
be
prosecuted.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
because
i
am
a
little
confused
on
the
statutory
scheme.
assume
the
government
is
right
on
the
construction
with
respect
to
1113
for
the
moment.
it
permits
late
registration
to
comply.
and
assuming
you,
before
you
applied
for
student
aid,
you
registered,
but
you
were
late
in
doing
so.
you
had
been
guilty
of
a
crime
up
to
the
time
you
registered.
now,
after
that,
you
apply
for
student
aid.
must
you
disclose
the
fact
that
you
had
not
registered
on
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
my
question.
must
you
disclose
it
in
your
application
for
student
aid?
unknown
speaker
you
just
have
to
say
you
have
registered.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
you
follow
that
sequence
of
events,
you
can
avoid
the
compulsion
to
incriminate
yourself.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
you
haven't
incriminated
yourself
in
the
document
you
have
been
compelled
to
file.
