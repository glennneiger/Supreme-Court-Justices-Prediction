mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
july
2nd,
1980,
president
carter,
pursuant
to
statutory
authority,
reactivated
a
draft
registration
requirement
for
men
between
the
ages
of
18
and
26.
after
about
two
years,
almost
7
percent
of
those
eligible
still
had
not
complied
with
the
registration
requirement,
in
some
cases
deliberately,
and
in
some
through
inadvertence.
in
1982,
sponsors
in
both
houses
of
congress
introduced
as
a
floor
amendment
to
the
1983
defense
authorization
act
section
1113,
which
would
condition
eligibility
for
title
4
college
student
aid
on
compliance
with
the
applicant's
draft
registration
obligation.
much
of
the
language
of
the
amendment,
which
is
sometimes
called
the
solomon
amendment,
was
supplied
by
secretary
bell,
who
worked
closely
with
the
sponsors
in
both
houses.
after
vigorous
debate,
it
passed
both
houses
by
overwhelming
bipartisan
majorities.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
district
court
holding
that
that
1982
solomon
amendment
violated
two
constitutional
guarantees,
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder
contained
in
article
1,
section
8,
section
9,
and
the
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination.
there
are
two
separate
and
independently
sufficient
reasons
why
the
district
court's
bill
of
attainder
holding
must
be
reversed.
the
first
is...
this
is
spelled
out
more
completely
in
our
reply
brief...
that
each
of
the
appellants'
contentions
rests
squarely
on
their
premise
that
the
law
does
not
permit
aid
to
late
registrants.
that
is,
those
who
register
more
than
30
days
after
their
18th
birthday.
and
the
second
reason
is
that
even
if
the
appellees
were
correct
on
the
late
registration
issue,
this
statute
still
is
not
a
bill
of
attainder.
i
will
deal
first
with
the
late
registration
issue.
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
secretary
of
education's
regulations
do
provide
that
those
who
register
late
are
eligible
for
aid
regardless
of
when
they
register.
there
is
accordingly
no
question
that
if
the
individual
appellees
in
this
case
comply
with
their
obligation
to
register,
the
government
will
give
them
the
aid
that
they
say
they
must
have.
that
is
what
the
regulations
provide,
and
that
has
been
the
consistent
practice.
in
providing
that
those
who
register
late
are
eligible,
the
regulatory
scheme
in
this
as
is
in
other
respects
is
faithful
to
the
statutory
purpose.
congress's
objective
in
passing
this
statute
was
not
to
catch
wrongdoers
and
punish
them.
it
was
rather
to
increase
the
number
of
people
who
are
on
the
draft
registration
roles
by
providing
both
a
reminder,
because
in
many
cases
the
reason
for
non-registration
was
simple
inadvertence,
and
also
an
economic
incentive.
we
turn
then
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
there
is
nothing
in
that
language
that
prohibits
this
result
which
the
regulations
provide.
the
statute
requires
registration
in
accordance
with
any
proclamation,
rule,
or
regulation,
and
the
president's
proclamation
does
require
registration
within
30
days
of
the
registrant's
18th
birthday.
the
apparent
reason
for
the
statutory
reference
in
the
solomon
amendment
to
rules,
regulations,
and
proclamations
is
that
section
3
of
the
civil
service
act
which
requires
registration
is
not
self-executing
and
does
not
come
into
play
until
there
is
some
proclamation,
rule,
or
regulation.
but
in
any
event
it
is
far
from
clear
that
in
accordance
with
means
within
the
time
fixed
by.
and
another
part
of
the
statute,
subsection
f(4),
which
is
really
the
fourth
subdivision
of
the
solomon
amendment,
supports
the
view
that
in
accordance
with
means
in
the
manner
required
by
rather
than
within
the
time
fixed
by.
in
any
event,
either
explanation
is
plausible.
certainly
neither
is
implausible,
and
under
those
circumstances
it
is
appropriate
to
consult
the
statutory
purpose,
the
statutory
history
in
determining
the
validity
of
these
regulations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
date?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
date.
as
of
the
date
of
the
solomon
amendment,
the
legislative
history
sometimes
says
500,000,
sometimes
says
seven,
and
sometimes
says
eight.
as
of
last
week,
it
was
approximately
half
that,
about
350,000.
there
is
little
doubt--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
will
give
you
some
figures
and
you
can
extrapolate
and
i
can
extrapolate.
i
think
i
can
tell
you
approximately
what
the
number
is.
that
number
of
somewhere
between
350
and
380
represents
about
3.1
percent
of
those
who
should
register,
whereas
the
earlier
figure
was
about
7
percent.
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
who
enacted
this
law
thought
of
the
statute
as
designed
to
create
an
incentive
to
register,
and
that
as
a
consequence
late
registrants
would
be
eligible.
the
ample
supports
for
this
rather
pervasive
view
among
the
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate
are
contained
in
the
brief,
and
there
are
many
on
both
sides.
senator
stennis,
for
example,
referred
to
some
youngster
who
might
have
overlooked
signing
up.
nevertheless,
in
the
senator's
language,
all
this
youngster
will
have
to
do
is
just
to
comply
with
the
law,
and
that
will
automatically
make
him
eligible.
there
are
many
similar
statements
cited
in
our
briefs.
finally,
there
is
the
matter
of
the
regulations
themselves.
this
is
the
strongest
possible
case
for
deference
to
the
administrative
regulations.
these
regulations
were
not
only
adopted
right
after
the
passage
of
the
statute,
through
the
joint
efforts
of
the
two
agencies
charged
with
its
implementation.
this
is
also
literally
a
case
where
the
draftsmen
of
the
statute,
or
one
of
the
draftsmen
of
the
statute
was
also
the
draftsman
of
the
regulations,
and
that
person
is,
of
course,
secretary
bell.
in
short,
every
single
guide
to
statutory
construction
points
in
the
same
direction,
and
if
this
statute
is
interpreted
consistent
with
its
purpose,
its
history,
and
it
implementing
regulations,
then
constitutional
issues
disappear,
because
neither
this
nor
any
other
court
has
ever
invalidated
as
a
bill
of
attainder
any
statute
whose
applicability
or
non-applicability
depended
upon
what
the
individual
would
or
would
not
do
in
the
future.
it
is
at
least
anomalous,
maybe
revealing
is
the
better
word,
that
the
appellees'
argument
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
this
statute
on
the
late
registration
issue
would
if
successful
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
get
financial
aid.
they
are
arguing
for
an
interpretation
of
the
law
which
actually
makes
it
harder
for
them
to
get
what
they
assure
us
that
they
must
absolutely
have.
this
shows
that
their
real
disagreement
is
with
the
congressional
policy
decisions
that
there
should
be
a
draft
registration
and
that
people
should
be
encouraged
to
register,
policy
decisions
which
clearly
fall
within
congress's
constitutional
authority.
i
turn
now
to
our
second
point.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
decision,
of
course,
was
made
at
an
earlier
point
in
time,
and
i
guess
it
was
made
in
1980,
and
actually
was
reflected
in
president
carter's
proclamation,
but
i
would
assume
that
it
is
simply
a
readiness
statute.
the
policymakers
of
our
nation
concluded
that
we
are
not
yet
at
the
stage
that
we
need
to
move
to
the
draft
itself,
but
just
to
a
readiness
position
in
the
event
that
the
draft
is
necessary.
even
if
this
statute
could
be
construed
to
prohibit
aid
to
late
registrants,
it
is
still
not
a
bill
of
attainder.
this
court
clarified
in
nixon
versus
the
administrator
that
to
qualify
as
a
bill
of
attainder
a
statute
must
meet
each
of
three
tests.
namely,
it
must
apply
only
to
a
specific
individual
or
group.
second,
it
must
inflict
punishment.
and
third,
it
must
deny
judicial
process.
this
statute
does
not
one
of
those
three
things.
first,
the
solomon
amendment
simply
is
not
punitive
within
the
bill
of
attainder
sense
of
that
word.
at
common
law,
bills
of
attainder
were
legislative
death
sentences,
usually
for
treason,
but
it
is
clear
that
article
1,
section
9,
also
includes
common
law
bills
of
pains
and
penalties,
which
included
such
penalties
as
imprisonment,
banishment,
and
confiscation
of
property,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
nixon
versus
administrator,
our
own
american
experience
has
added
one
other
category,
and
that
is
disqualification
from
certain
kinds
of
employment
because
of
a
legislative
determination
of
past
wrongdoing
by
particular
individuals
or
groups.
but
punishment
for
bill
of
attainder
purposes
clearly
does
not
extend
to
any
circumstance
of
non-realization
of
an
economic
benefit
which
any
individual
would
like
to
have,
and
the
square
holding
of
fleming
versus
nestor
is
that
the
mere
denial,
in
fleming's
words,
the
mere
denial
of
a
non-contractual
governmental
benefit
does
not
amount
to
punishment
for
bill
of
attainder
purposes,
and
that
is
all
we
have
here,
the
mere
denial
of
a
non-contractual
governmental
benefit.
if
it
was
not
punishment
to
deprive
mr.
nestor
of
his
social
security
benefits
after
he
had
paid
into
the
fund
for
19
years,
then
a
fortiori
it
is
not
punishment
to
condition
student
aid
to
registration
with
the
draft.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
do
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
do
not.
there
is
no
way,
i
guess,
that
the
government
would
have
access
to
that
kind
of
information.
i
turn
now
to
the
other
two
elements
of
bill
of
attainder.
with
regard
to
specificity,
this
law
applies
to
non-registrants.
it
is
the
complete
antithesis,
the
complete
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
the
specific
identification
that
we
experienced
at
common
law
or
any
other
instance
in
which
any
statute
has
ever
been
held
unconstitutional
as
a
bill
of
attainder.
it
is
an
open-ended
group
whose
fluctuating
membership
will
be
determined
by
events
which
are
yet
to
occur
in
the
future,
and
that
argument
does
not
depend
on
our
position
with
regard
to
late
registration,
because
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
late
registration,
the
class
affected
is
nonetheless
one
that
changes
every
day
and
whose
composition
is
constantly
subject
to
future
contingencies
as
more
young
men
turn
18
and
either
register
or
neglect
or
decline
to
register.
and
as
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
never
in
the
history
of
our
republic
has
any
statute
ever
been
held
unconstitutional
as
a
bill
of
attainder
where
its
membership
depended
upon
events
which
might
yet
occur
in
the
future.
with
regard
to
denial
of
judicial
process,
the
only
relevant
issue
or
determination
through
the
judicial
type
process,
whether
the
individual
does
or
does
not
fall
within
the
legislative
target
area,
is
whether
the
individual
has
registered.
it
is
therefore
completely
unlike
the
circumstance
in
united
states
versus
brown,
in
which
the
issue
was
whether
communism
was
an
adequate
proxy
for...
to
engage
in
political
strikes.
and
since
this
statute
and
these
regulations
do
provide
for
the
individual
who
wants
to
show
that
in
fact
he
has
registered,
this
characteristic,
this
factor
also
has
been
satisfied.
i
turn
finally
to
the
appellees'
privilege
against
self-incrimination
argument.
there
are
three
short
reasons
why
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
compulsion.
there
is
no
compulsion
in
prescribing
standards
of
eligibility
for
student
aid.
indeed,
non-registrants
are
not
only
not
compelled
to
apply
for
student
aid.
it
would
be
useless
for
them
to
do
so
because
they
are
ineligible,
and
it
is
not
a
crime
not
to
apply
for
student
aid.
moreover,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
does
not
assure
that
there
will
be
no
adverse
economic
consequences
from
remaining
silent.
the
garrity,
spevack,
gardner,
lefkowitz
line
of
cases
on
which
the
appellees
rely
stand
for
the
proposition
that
government
may
not
compel
self-incrimination,
may
not
compel
self-incriminating
testimony
without
a
grant
of
immunity.
they
do
not
stand
for
the
proposition,
as
this
court
made
very
clear
in
the
gardner
case,
that
nothing
that
the
person
says
or
doesn't
say
can
ever
be
used
to
his
economic
advantage,
or
disadvantage.
surely,
for
example,
the
drug
enforcement
administration
is
entitled
to
ask
a
job
applicant
whether
he
uses
drugs.
surely
in
employing
lawyers
from
my
office
we
are
entitled
to
ask
whether
the
applicant
has
ever
stolen
money
from
a
client.
surely
the
department
of
agriculture
is
entitled
to
ask
an
applicant
for
federal
crop
insurance
whether
he
is
growing
marijuana
on
his
farm.
and
in
the
administration
of
title
4
itself,
surely
the
department
of
education
can
ask
whether
the
applicant
is
legally
in
this
country,
because
that
is
one
of
the
qualifications
for
student
aid.
third,
there
is
an
element
of
unreality
about
the
appellees'
fifth
amendment
argument.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
after
all
is
to
get
people
registered.
a
major
objective,
a
major
theme
in
the
legislative
history
is
that
those
people
who
had
not
registered
on
time
should
register
late,
and
that
was
a
major
purpose
of
this
statute,
to
get
those
who
had
not
registered
on
time
to
register
late.
it
would
be
a
perversion
of
that
purpose
to
prosecute
late
registrants,
to
prosecute
for
doing
the
very
thing
that
the
statute
was
passed
to
encourage,
and
it
has
never
been
done.
this
court
said
in
marketti
that
the
central
standard
for
the
privileges
application
has
been
whether
the
claimant
is
confronted
by
substantial
and
real
as
opposed
to
mere
trifling
or
imaginary
hazards
of
incrimination.
i
cannot
imagine
any
hazards
of
incrimination
that
more
appropriately
fit
that
definition,
trifling
and
imaginary.
one
person
of
the
presumably
tens
of
thousands,
probably
even
hundreds
of
thousands,
who
have
registered
late
thus
far
has
been
prosecuted,
and
that
is
firmly
opposed
to
government
policy.
one
final
note,
and
on
this
i
will
close.
it
probably
is
not...
it
may
not
be
independently
dispositive,
but
at
the
very
least
there
is
an
additional
consideration
which
should
influence
the
standard
of
review
for
this
congressional
exercise
of
the
spending
power,
regardless
of
whether
it
applies
to
bill
of
attainder
or
the
fifth
amendment.
last
term,
in
regan
versus
taxation
with
representation,
this
court
held
that
congress
is
entitled
to
great
deference
in
making
its
judgments
concerning
how
the
nation's
revenues
are
to
be
gathered
and
the
tax
burden
distributed
among
different
persons
and
groups.
i
know
of
no
basis
for
distinguishing
in
this
respect
between
congress's
power
to
tax
as
in
regan
versus
taxation
with
representation
and
its
power
to
spend
as
in
this
case.
the
language
of
the
constitution
locks
them
together,
and
this
court's
decisions
consistently
treat
them
as
subject
to
identical
constitutional
standards.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
one
thing
i
planned
to
say
was
what
justice
stevens
has
just
clarified,
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
with
regard
to
that
matter
or
anything
else,
i
have
nothing
further.
