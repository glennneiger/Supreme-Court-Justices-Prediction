unknown
speaker
was
that
judgment
stayed?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
who
extended
it?
unknown
speaker
who
extended
it,
the
secretary
or--
unknown
speaker
--was
he
dependent
or
what?
unknown
speaker
the
court
was
right
about
that,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
court
was
right
about
that,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
it
quite
correct
to
say
that
is
entirely
a
gender-based
clause?
it
does
include...
the
exception
clause
hits
both...
rather
preserves
the
benefit
for
both
the
retired
female
government
employees
and
also
for
dependent
spouses
for
female
employees.
unknown
speaker
and
the
burden
of
proof.
unknown
speaker
but,
as
far
as
whose
money
is
involved,
if
you
get
all
the
facts
on
the
table,
there
are
both
men
and
women
who
are
benefited
by
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
do
you
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
instead
of
a
five-year
period,
that
congress
had
extended
it
to
cover
up
to
the
year
2010
or
something?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
did
go
further
than
the
usual
severability
clause,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
this
argument,
mr.
benn,
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
counsel
for
your
client
didn't
raise
it
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benn,
that
interpretation
though
of
this
statute
is
just
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
intent
and
under
those
circumstances
this
court
doesn't
apply
that
canon
of
construction
that
you
are
suggesting.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benn,
is
there
really
much
left
to
the
offset
clause
if
you
win
on
this
argument?
unknown
speaker
aren't
husbands
the
main
people
they
are
interested
in
in
the
offset
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
not
right
that
the
main
group
they
wanted
the
offset
to
apply
to
was
husbands
who
had
supported
themselves?
unknown
speaker
that
is
where
most
of
the
money
is
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
would
reverse
the
congressional
decision
as
that
major
group
covered
by
the
offset
provision.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
against
you
on
that
point.
chico
county
drainage
district,
some
of
the
doctrine
of
chevron
oil.
there
are
lots
of
people
who
do
rely
on
unconstitutional
statute,
and
this
court
in
different
cases
has
upheld
that
reliance.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
say
there
cannot
be
reliance
on
an
unconstitutional
statute?
were
you
making
a
statement
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
so
was
chico
drainage
district.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
a
municipal
bankruptcy
statute
that
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
and
then
later
reliance
interests
were
asserted
and
the
this
court
in
a
subsequent
case
said,
sure,
it
was
unconstitutional,
but
that
doesn't
mean
people
don't
do
things
in
reliance.
unknown
speaker
why
shouldn't
this
court
recognize
congress'
choice
as
well
as
trying
to
make
on
of
its
own?
unknown
speaker
why
was
there
even
an
exception
then?
unknown
speaker
whom
were
they
attempting
to
benefit
by
this
exception?
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
had
somebody
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
mr.
benn,
may
i
ask,
you
mentioned
mr.
mathews'
reliance
interest.
earlier
i
thought
you
suggested
the
statute
was
discriminatory
against
his
wife.
which
is
it,
discrimination
against
males
or
females?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
argument
is
you
make
retirement
plans
and
even
employment
plans
some
years
in
advance
and
it
made
a
big
difference
whether
you
worked
for
the
government
or
you
didn't
work
for
the
government.
there
are
a
lot
of
decisions
that
might
be
affected
over
the
long
run,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
but,
if
one
distinguishes
between
an
act
of
congress
on
the
one
hand
and
reliance
on
a
decision
by
this
court
on
the
other
hand,
he
is
just
not
on
the
reliance
of
the
act
of
congress
class.
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
a
different
reliance
class.
unknown
speaker
do
you
claim...
do
you
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
he
lacks...
the
solicitor
general
says
mr.
mathews
would
not
lack
standing
to
make
the
challenge
he
made
here
however
the
severability
clause
is
construed.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need
to
get
to
the
legislative
history
at
all
in
the
severability
clause?
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
it
is
applicable,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
don't
say
"okay".
can
you
answer
me
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
then
let
me
read
you
a
sentence
from
the
district
judge's
opinion
and
ask
you
whether
you
agree
with
it.
on
page
8a
of
the
jurisdiction
statement,
the
district
judge
says,
"the
court
is
convinced
therefore
that
the
severability
clause
is
not
an
expression
of
the
true
congressional
intent.
"
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
with
the
argument
if
it
were
made?
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
with
the
argument
if
it
were
made?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
language
of
the
statute
then
is
governing
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
majority
have
to
vote
for
it
to
pass
it?
