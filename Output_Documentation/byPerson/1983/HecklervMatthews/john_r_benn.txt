mr.
john
r.
benn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
address
mr.
mathews'
arguments
on
the
issues
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
preface
my
remarks
with
a
characterization
that
has
been
made
on
the
exception
clause.
the
exception
clause
has
been
characterized
by
the
solicitor
as
being
a
transitional
device.
it
is
not
that.
it
is
a
lifetime
exemption
for
everyone
who
qualifies.
those
individuals,
those
females,
those
non-dependent
females,
and
those
dependent
men
who
get
into
this
window
that
is
created
by
the
exception
clause
will
remain
within
that
window
or
within
that
class
throughout
their
lifetime.
so,
this
is
not
a
device
that
beginning
in
1983,
this
year,
will
entitle
mr.
mathews
to
benefits.
please,
that
characterization
is
going
to
be
important
when
you
compare
the
social
security
contributions
of
the
spouses
and
see
the
inequality
that
is
achieved
under
the
statute
as
designed.
the
fundamental
question
before
this
court
is
if
the
exception
clause
is
interpreted
in
one
fashion
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
perpetuation
of
the
unconstitutional
sex
discrimination
that
occurred
in
goldfarb.
the
statute
is
important,
both
to
classes
of
men,
as
indicated
by
mr.
robert
mathews,
but
perhaps
more
importantly
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
from
that
of
mary
mathews,
because
it
depreciates
her
social
security
contributions
while
at
the
same
time
provides
less
financial
resources
for
her
family
unit
than
what
is
provided
to
a
similarly
situated
male
applicant.
that
is
important
as
far
as
the
focus
of
this
particular
case.
the
fundamental
question
is
divided
into
three
areas.
first
of
all,
a
statutory
interpretation
issue,
whether
or
not
the
exception
clause
incorporates
a
gender-based
dependency
test.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
mary
mathews;
and,
third,
whether
this
court
should
extend
or
nullify
the
exception
clause
as
stated
in
the
legislation.
directing
my
attention
first
of
all
to
the
statutory
argument,
in
essence,
it
is
mr.
mathews'
position
that
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
affirmance
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
asked
the
court
in
brief
to
focus
on
two
items.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
he
said
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and,
second
of
all,
its
legislative
history.
focusing
on
the
first
of
those,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
if
the
court
will
review
section
334(g),
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute
indicating
that
dependency
is
required.
it
does
not
per
se
require
dependency.
now,
please
keep
in
mind
the
framework
under
which
that
clause
was
passed.
that
clause
was
passed
after
congress
had
known
how
the
court
was
going
to
interpret
section
402(c)
of
the
social
security
act.
in
essence,
reading
out
gender-based
dependency
as
being
a
requirement
for
special
benefits.
now,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
offer
it
in
district
court,
and
if
i
could,
perhaps
give
an
explanation.
it
was
not
until
after
we
got
involved
in
the
case
on
appeal
that
we
discovered
two
district
court
decisions
that
were
previously
not
reported
and
wherein
the
issue
was
accepted
by
the
district
courts,
and
since
we
had
undertaken
the
appeal
or
i
had
undertaken
the
appeal,
we
have
also
had
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
which
indicated
that
the
exception
clause,
by
statutory
construction,
would
not--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
feel
though
that
it
is
basis
on
which
the
case
can
be
affirmed
based
upon
the
statutory
construction.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
fair
characterization
to
make
that
there
has
been
an
unfair
mixture
made
in
the
presentation
before
this
court
of
the
legislative
history.
you
must
separate,
please,
the
history
of
the
pension
offset
provision.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
and,
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
is
not
an
issue.
what
is
an
issue
will
be
the
legislative
history
of
the
exception
clause.
that
has
almost
no
legislative
history.
at
best,
it
could
be
characterized
as
statements
by
senator
long
and
representative
oldman
on
the
floor
of
congress
saying
this
was
supposedly
going
to
be
the
intent.
for
the
minority
people
in
congress,
that
may
have
been
the
intent.
the
legislative
documents
that
were
produced
after
passage,
the
committee
reports
and
the
summaries,
indicate
a
more
generalization.
the
exception
clause
was
designed
to
protect
the
reliance
interests
of
people.
they
refer
repeatedly,
and
footnote
12
of
our
brief
highlights
this,
to
terminology
that
is
non-gender
specific
and
that
is
the
approach
that
we
are
taking;
that
you
can
give
meaning
to
the
statute
in
this
particular
case
without
ever
reaching
the
constitutional
issue.
and,
the
is
important
from
the
precepts
of
this
court
that
constitutional
issues
should
be
avoided
if
there
can
be
a
fair
alternate
construction
of
the
statute.
and,
although
not
binding
upon
this
court--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--no,
your
honor.
if
you
recall,
mr.
levy
indicated
to
you
at
least
four
classes
of
beneficiaries
that
would
still
be
affected
by
the
pension
offset
provision.
the
only
class
that
would
not
be
affected
by
the
offset
provision
by
this
interpretation
is
going
to
be
mr.
mathews
or
the
class
represented
by
mr.
mathews
for
special
benefits.
that
is
husbands.
but,
there
are,
indeed,
four
classes
that
still
will
be
affected
by
the
pension
offset
provision.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
is
just
simply
the
husbands
concerned.
we
have
the
situation
about
the
difference
in
length
of
divorces
as
to
entitlement
and
we
do
have
three
classes--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--certainly
from
the
aspect
of--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
approach
we
are
taking.
however,
that
would
still
be
an
unfair
characterization
of
the
legislative
intent.
the
pension
offset
provision
and
the
effect
of
the
exception
clause
only
effects
about
five
percent
of
the
savings
that
were
intended
to
be
made
by
the
'77
legislation.
so,
it
was
not...
it
cannot
be
characterized
as
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
as
such.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
interpret...
go
beyond
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
we
go
to
the
legislative
history...
i
have
discussed
the
legislative
is,
in
essence,
non-gender
specific
with
the
exception
of
two
remarks
made
on
the
floor
of
congress.
beyond
that
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
uses
terminology
as
it
affects
and
being
administered
in
january
of
1977.
peculiarly,
there
is
not
anything
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
why
the
date
of
january
1977
was
selected.
there
is
nothing
indicating
that
that
date
has
particular
importance
as
opposed
to
december
1976
or
february
1977,
and
until
that
keystone
of
construction
is
reached,
there
is
not
necessarily
the
meaning
asked
by
the
solicitor
to
be
given
to
the
statute.
as
being
administered,
that
particular
portion
of
the
phrase
of
the
statute
is
also
important
because
the
secretary
at
that
particular
time
in
january
of
1977
was
not
administering
the
statute
to
preclude
benefits
because
of
dependency.
they
were
administering
the
statute
by
simply
taking
a
pot
full
of
applications
and
holding
them
in
abeyance
until
the
court
made
its
decision
in
goldfarb.
ostensibly,
after
the
goldfarb
opinion
was
announced,
all
of
those
applications
for
benefits,
be
they
in
january
of
1977
or
for
six
months
prior,
were
given
full
force
and
effect.
those
benefits
were
paid.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
deals
with
an
equal
protection
issue
and
applies
to
the
case
of
mary
mathews.
the
solicitor
has
stated
that
the
standards
be
applied
by
this
court,
and
one
which
we
accept,
is
that
the
exception
clause
must
serve
an
important
governmental
interest
and
at
the
same
time
the
means
selected
by
congress
must
be
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
that
important
governmental
objective.
now,
a
remark
that
the
solicitor
does
not
make
that
is,
however,
important
that
when
you
attempt
to
analyze
the
situation,
is
who
must
bear
the
burden
of
proving
that
particular
standard.
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
discrimination,
if
it
is
there,
serves
an
important
governmental
purpose
and
is
substantially
related,
rests
upon
the
secretary
in
this
instance.
it
is
not
a
burden
that
mr.
mathews
has
to
bear.
i
will
ask
the
court
then
to
focus
in
on
the
interests
and
the
means
selected
by
congress.
it
is
our
firm
contention
that
reliance
interests
within
the
context
of
this
particular
case
is
not
an
important
governmental
objective.
and,
i
make
that
statement
with
two
things
in
mind.
first
of
all,
if
you
accept
that
reliance
interest
is
important,
then
in
any
case
where
there
has
been
an
equal
protection
violation
most
probably
there
will
be
a
class
of
people
who
relied
upon
that
statute.
stated
otherwise,
there
cannot
be
reliance
upon
an
unconstitutional
statute,
and
that
is
in
essence
what--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
justice
rehnquist,
however--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
making
the
statement
for
purposes
of
analysis
and
perhaps
i
could
explain
it
this
way.
this
case
is
in
a
different
context.
this
case
attempts
to
protect
a
reliance
interest
that
was
already
held
unconstitutional
by
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
particular
case.
mr.
john
r.
benn
okay.
your
honor,
that
would
be
true,
however,
this
case
could
be
characterized
differently,
and
perhaps
from
what
i
am
reading
from
what
you
told
me
about
that
case,
that
was
the
judicial
acceptance
of
a
reliance
interest.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
an
attempt
by
congress
to
impose
their
own
interpretation
of
what
reliance
interest
is
upon
the
court.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
if
there
is
an
analysis
by
congress
indicating
that
they
have
studied
the
issue
and
have
determined
that
reliance
interest
is
present,
perhaps
it
could
be
accepted
in
that
situation.
however,
please
look
at
this
particular
case
and
look
at
it
in
light
of
some
principles
that
the
court
has
announced.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
indicating
that
there
are
such
things
as
reliance
interests.
even
the
solicitor
in
brief
or
the
secretary
in
brief
has
had
a
problem
in
characterizing
those
interests.
mr.
john
r.
benn
okay.
the
exception
was
simply,
by
our
perception,
something
that
congress
utilized
in
order
to
buy
additional
time
to
study
the
issue
of
providing
universal
coverage
under
social
security.
mr.
john
r.
benn
okay.
they
were
attempting
to--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor,
anyone
who
had
a
legitimate
reliance
interest.
and,
of
course,
in
the
case
of
mr.
mathews,
he
has
actual
reliance
interests.
that
is...
what
i
am
attempting
to
indicate
to
the
court
is
to
try
to
distinguish
between
an
expectation
interest
and
a
reliance
interest.
mr.
john
r.
benn
okay.
the
statute
is
discriminatory
against
females
because
it
provides
less
for
their
social
security
contributions
in
terms
of
special
benefits.
however,
if
you
go
beyond
the
equal
protection
analysis
and
get
into
the
specifics
of
what
is
being
offered
as
the
justification
for
the
statute,
you
are
left
only
with
the
protection
of
reliance
interests.
and,
it
is
our
firm
contention
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
reliance
interest
upon,
first
of
all,
an
unconstitutional
law,
and,
second
of
all,
upon
the
proposition
that
i
am
arguing
at
this
point.
that
is
a
pre-goldfarb
state
of
the
law.
we
have
attempted
to
indicate
that.
a
person
who
retires
and
is
eligible
for
this
exception
clause
must
do
their
retirement
after
december
1,
1977.
the
secretary
attempts
to
characterize
that
after
that
time
period
a
person
who
retires
is
relying
upon
a
state
of
the
law
that
antedates
that
decision
by
as
much
as
ten
months
or
more.
at
most
at
that
time
the
people
had
an
expectation--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor.
however,
it
attempts
to
demean
the
actual
protection.
then,
in
the
second
issue
that
i
am
going
to
raise
and
that
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
substantially
related.
if
you
accept
for
a
minute
your
proposition
that
there
is
such
things
as
reliance
interest,
then
in
that
situation
you
have
a
failure
of
the
statute
to
be
sufficiently
tailored
to
protect
those
reliance
interests.
and,
that
is
the
situation
of
mr.
mathews.
mr.
mathews,
at
the
time
he
first--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--your
honor,
he
is
not
in
the
situation--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor,
but
he
is
in
the
reliance
of
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
he
made
his
retirement
decision.
he
made
his
retirement...
he
first
considered
making
his
retirement
decision
in
september
of
1977.
at
that
time,
the
state
of
the
law
would
entitle
him
to
special
benefits
if
he
submitted
an
application
and
otherwise
qualified.
he
forewent
three
years
of
continued
employment
with
the
post
office
based
upon
the
statements
from
the
local
social
security
office
that
he
would
receive
benefits.
and,
for
that
reason
he
cannot
now
go
back...
with
a
change
in
legislative
approach
to
the
question
of
exception
clause...
he
cannot
now
go
back
and
attempt
to
change
that
decision
and
be
rehired
by
the
post
office
in
order
to
gain
additional
three
years
of
employment
that
he
has
suffered
through.
perhaps
more
importantly
to
the
overall
issue
of
equal
protection
is
our
third
argument
that
we
have
argued
which
is
the
challenge
that
it
presents
to
the
judicial
authority
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
equal
protection
analysis.
if
the
court
will
allow
the
secretary
in
this
instance
or
allow
congress
in
this
instance
to
pass
legislation
to
protect
reliance
interests,
then
it
can
perhaps
thwart
equal
protection
review
because,
as
we
have
pointed
out
and
as
we
have
argued,
in
each
and
every
instance
there
probably
will
be
some
individuals
who
would
have
relied
upon
the
ostensible
unconstitutional
law
and
could
be
protected.
for
example,
in
the
area
of
desegregation,
this
similar
approach
could
be
analogized
to
the
approach
taken
in
the
exception
clause
by
congress
or
the
states
in
particular
cases
indicating
that
rather
follow
the
court's
decision
in
brown,
instead,
what
we
are
going
to
attempt
to
do
is
we
are
going
to
allow
protective
reliance
interests
of
everyone
who
bought
homes
in
particular
neighborhoods,
reliance
on
the
fact
that
they
could
send
their
children
to
segregated
schools,
and
continue
the
effect
of
an
unlawful
statute
and
unconstitutional
statutes
for
many
years
in
the
future.
the
third
issue
that
is
perhaps
the
important
one
that
really
threatens
the
court's
authority
is
in
the
area
of
the
inverse
severability
clause.
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
to
characterize
that
clause.
it
is
not
the
traditional
severability
clause
that
the
court
has
considered.
this
is
an
inverse
severability
clause.
it
attempts
to
impose
upon
this
court
a
rule
of
decision
in
this
particular
case,
not
simply
to
save
a
remaining
portion
of
the
statute.
there
are
three
problems
that
mr.
matthews
can
identify
with
that
particular
clause.
the
first
deals
with
the
threat
to
the
judiciary
and
to
the
process
of
judicial
review.
if,
on
the
surface,
the
clause
is
accepted
as
valid,
then
there
is
no
means
for
judicial
review
for
what
is
considered
an
equal
protection
violation
within
this
context.
mr.
mathews
must
go
entirely
remediless
in
this
particular
context
of
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
remedy.
if
the
inverse
severability
clause
is
accepted,
then
there
would
be
no
remedy
for
mr.
mathews,
albeit
there
is
an
unconstitutional
violation
to
him.
this
brings
us
to
the
aspect
of
whether
or
not
there
must
be
a
sufficient
remedy
for
an
unconstitutional
violation.
and,
of
course,
the
court
must,
in
the
first
instance,
examine
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
we
would
not
argue
to
the
contrary.
however,
the
court
must
go
a
step
further.
after
they
have
examined
the
legislative
history--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--okay.
there
is
no
question--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
think
the
argument
can
be
made
that--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--pardon?
mr.
john
r.
benn
yes,
your
honor,
as
to
the
majority
of
congress
at
the
time.
i
certainly
would.
mr.
john
r.
benn
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history...
and
i
don't
consider
the
language
itself
is
the
inexorable
command
upon
the
court.
i
view
the
statute
as
simply
being
an
indication
of
legislative
intent.
to
that
extent,
i
think
it
is
an
unreliable
indication
when
you
consider
the
majority
of
congress.
and,
if
you
carry
it
a
step
further,
which
is
what
i
am
arguing--
mr.
john
r.
benn
--your
honor,
they
did,
but
at
the
time
that
they
voted
to
pass
it
please
keep
in
mind
that
they
had
no
written
report
before
them.
they
didn't
have
the
text
of
the
statute
before
them.
they
waived
all
of
those
rules
in
order
to
pass
the
particular
statute.
this
is,
as
best
our
research
can
determine,
the
first
instance
in
which
congress
has
interposed
an
inverse
severability
clause
on
a
piece
of
legislation.
obviously,
in
light
of
the
goldfarb
decision,
there
is
some
question
to
the
viability
of
the
equal
protection
basis
for
the
statute.
now,
to
the
extent
that
we
look
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
remedy,
it
is
mr.
mathews'
contention
that
the
remedy
in
this
particular
case
to
him
is
entirely
inadequate.
we
had
a
very
similar
situation
that
came
up
in
the
district
court
in
the
rosofsky
decision
based
upon
the
same
exception
clause,
based
upon
the
same
principles.
in
that
particular
case,
the
district
court
applied
the
inverse
severability
clause
and
in
essence
required
mr.
rosofsky
to
go
remediless.
he
had
no
remedy
although
there
was,
in
fact,
found
a
constitutional
violation.
there
is
no
mechanism
within
the
statute,
the
inverse
severability
clause,
in
which
congress
explored
how
they
wanted
the
inverse
severability
clause
to
be
applied.
we
have
a
second
problem
here
and
that
deals
with
retroactive
benefits.
now,
on
the
one
hand,
if
you
accept
the
principle
of
the
inverse
severability
clause,
it
is
in
direct
conflict
with
congress'
enactment
of
section
204(b)
of
the
social
security
act
which
says
that
benefits
that
are
paid
in
good
faith
will
not
be
recouped.
so,
in
this
particular
situation,
from
1977
or
from
the
date
of
the
order
in
this
case,
december
1979,
up
until
the
date
of
this
court's
decision,
unless
the
court
awards
relief
to
mr.
mathews,
all
benefits
will
have
been
paid
to
his
opposing
class
in
direct
conflict
with
the
intent
of
the
inverse
severability
clause.
so,
it
would
seem
apparent
that
the
court
must,
at
the
very
least,
award
the
class
represented
by
mr.
mathews
retroactive
benefits
back
to
the
time
of
his
application
and
only
apply
perspective
nullification
of
the
statute.
we
would
argue
in
the
contrary
that
the
best
approach
to
take
at
this
particular
point
would
be
for
the
court
to
simply
not
nullify
the
statute,
but
extent
the
benefits.
at
that
time
they
could
leave
a
reasoned
decision
and
analysis
to
congress
as
to
how
congress
would
apply
the
situation
in
the
future,
but
award
the
class
the
back
benefits
for
the
time
that
they
were
discriminated
against.
in
summary,
there
are
in
essence
three
issues
before
the
court.
there
is,
first
of
all,
a
statutory
interpretation
issue
which,
if
accepted
based
upon
the
principles
that
the
district
court
of
the
ninth
circuit
have
announced,
would
allow
a
means
in
which
this
court
could
avoid
a
constitutional
issue,
yet
at
the
same
time
give
some
meaning
to
the
statute
and
give
some
meaning
to
the
fact
that
the
court
did
have
the
goldfarb
decision
which
was
known
by
congress
at
that
time
they
passed
the
exception
clause.
the
second
aspect
requiring
affirmance
in
this
situation
deals
with
the
violation
of
equal
protection.
the
violation
occurs
to
mary
mathews
because
it
provides
less
benefits
for
her
and
her
family
unit
than
what
it
provided
to
a
similarly
situated
male.
on
the
surface,
reliance
interest
does
not
seem
to
be
in
this
context
of
this
case
after
there
has
been
a
decision
of
unconstitutionality
to
be
an
important
governmental
interest.
the
statute
surely
is
not
narrowly
tailored
because
the
class,
as
indicated
by
mr.
mathews,
certainly
are
not
offered
protection
for
their
legitimate
reliance
interests
that
have
occurred.
the
last
aspect
requiring
affirmance
is
in
the
area
of
the
inverse
severability
clause.
that
is
an
attempt
to
thwart
judicial
review
in
this
case.
it
would
require
mr.
robert
mathews
to
go
remediless,
albeit
there
is
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
his
rights
and
the
rights
of
mary
mathews.
unless
this
court
provides
some
mechanism
which
in
this
case
goes
back
to
the
court's
initial
reasoning
in
the
westcott
decision
that
the
most
appropriate
remedy
in
this
case
must
be
extension
of
the
benefits.
allow
congress
to
act
after
the
court's
decision,
but
until
that
time,
extend
the
benefits.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
the
district
court's
decision
be
affirmed.
