mr.
mark
i.
levy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama.
it
involves
the
government
pension
offset
section
in
the
social
security
amendments
of
1977
and
in
particular
the
exception
and
severability
provisions
in
the
offset
section.
the
district
court,
after
certifying
a
nationwide
class
action,
invalidated
both
the
exception
and
the
severability
provisions.
based
on
those
rulings,
the
district
court
extended
spousal
benefits
or
expanded
the
exception
to
appellee
and
the
nationwide
class
of
non-dependent
men
he
represents,
and
as
a
result,
it
entitled
those
non-dependent
men
to
the
receipt
of
both
government
pension
and
social
security
spousal
benefits.
the
social
security
provides
spousal
benefits--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--the
judgment
was
stayed
pending
appeal
to
this
court
and
it
remains
stayed.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
the
social
security
act
provides
spousal
benefits
based
on
the
earnings
record
of
the
applicant's
spouse.
the
provisions
for
wives'
and
widows'
benefits
were
enacted
in
1939,
the
provisions
for
husbands'
and
widowers'
benefits
in
1950.
from
the
time
spousal
benefits
were
first
established,
the
act
has
contained
a
social
security
offset
provision.
that
provision
requires
that
were
an
applicant
is
entitled
to
more
than
one
benefit
under
the
social
security
act,
those
benefits
will
be
offset
against
each
other
so
that
in
net
effect
the
recipient
or
the
applicant
will
receive
only
the
higher
of
the
two
benefits.
for
example,
if
an
applicant
is
entitled
to
spousal
benefits
and
also
to
retirement
benefits
based
on
his
own
work
account,
the
spousal
benefits
will
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
direct
benefit
to
which
the
applicant
is
entitled.
until
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
act
contained
no
comparable
provision
for
people,
primarily
government
employees,
who
worked
in
employment
that
was
not
covered
by
the
social
security
system.
in
march
1977,
this
court
decided
the
goldfarb
case
and
invalidated
the
gender-based
eligibility
standard
in
the
social
security
act
that
required
men,
but
not
women,
to
prove
dependency
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
spousal
benefits.
as
a
result
of
goldfarb,
spousal
benefits,
therefore,
were
extended
to
non-dependent
men.
in
practice,
this
did
not--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
don't
believe
that
the
issue
of
extension
versus
nullification
was
ever
directly
litigated
in
this
court.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
believing
that
that
to
be
the
result
that
follows
from
the
decision
of
this
court,
the
benefits
were
extended.
that,
in
practice,
did
not
prove
to
be
a
problem
for
the
social
security
trust
fund
with
respect
to
non-dependent
men
who
worked
in
employment
covered
by
social
security.
those
men
usually
were
entitled
to
higher
benefits
on
their
own
work
account
than
on
the
account
of
their
spouse.
because
the
social
security
act
has
an
eligibility
requirement
providing
that
a
spousal
applicant
must
have
no
or
only
minimal
benefits
in
his
own
account
and
because
of
the
offset,
the
social
security
offset
provision
that
already
existed
in
the
act,
in
fact,
no
spousal
payments
were
generally
made
to
this
group
of
non-dependent
men.
it
was
a
far
different
situation,
however,
for
non-dependent
men
who
worked
in
employment
that
was
not
covered
by
social
security.
as
to
this
group,
spousal
benefits,
in
fact,
were
payable,
and
because
they
were
not
subject
to
the
existing
social
security
offsets,
since
they
weren't
employed
in
work
covered
by
social
security,
those
spousal
payments
were
the
full,
unreduced
amount
and
were
not
adjusted
in
any
way
to
reflect
their
government
pension.
this
caused
a
windfall
for
this
group
of
non-dependent
men.
because
they
did
not
meet
the
eligibility
standards
set
out
by
congress
in
the
social
security
act,
they
did
not
expect
to
receive
spousal
benefits
and
they
could
not
have
planned
their
retirements
in
reliance
on
the
receipt
of
such
benefits.
the
goldfarb
decision
threatened
to
impose
a
very
serious
financial
drain
on
the
social
security
trust
fund.
congress
responded
to
this
problem
by
enacting
the
government
offset
pension
provision
that
is
now
before
the
court.
in
this
provision,
parallel
to
the
social
security
offset
that
was
already
in
the
act
for
covered
employment,
this
provision
provides
that
the
spousal
benefits,
that
the
level
of
spousal
benefits
will
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
government
pension
to
which
the
applicant
is
entitled
and
receives
payment
based
on
his
own
work
record.
the
offset
provision,
the
government
pension
offset
provision
at
issue
here
applies
to
spousal
benefits
that
are
payable
based
on
valid
applications
filed
on
or
after
december
1,
1977,
which
was
the
effective
date
of
the
new
offset
provision
for
government
pensions.
now,
the
government
pension
offset
provision
was
a
reasonable
and
a
permissible
solution
to
the
financial
problems
confronting
the
social
security
trust
fund
following
goldfarb.
but,
in
enacting
this
provision,
congress
became
concerned
about
a
different
problem.
congress
became
concerned
that
the
elimination
or
reduction
of
dual
benefits
that
would
be
caused
by
applying
the
new
government
offset
provision
to
people
who
had
planned...
well,
to
people
who
had
retired
or
were
close
to
retirement
and
who
had
planned
a
retirement
in
accordance
with
pre-goldfarb
law
that
allowed
for
unreduced
spousal
payments.
congress
felt
that
the
application
of
the
offset
to
these
people
would
have
imposed
a
hardship
on
them
and
been
unfair
to
them.
so,
to
allay
this
concern,
congress
enacted
a
specific
exception
to
the
government
pension
offset.
the
exception
provides...
the
exception
applies
to
people
who
are
retired
or
are
eligible
for
retirement
from
government
service
in
the
five-year
period
between
december
1977,
when
the
act
was
passed,
and
november
1982,
and
who
could
meet
the
requirements
of
the
social
security
act
in
effect
and
being
administered
in
january
of
1977.
the
offset
and
the
exception
clause
also
contain
a
severability
provision.
this
provides
that
if
the
exception
is
held
to
be
invalid
in
any
respect,
the
offset
itself
will
remain
in
effect
and
that
the
exception
will
be
eliminated
in
its
entirety
rather
than
extended
to
new
people.
the
severability
clause
reflects
congress'
overriding
concern
with
the
financial
health
of
the
social
security
trust
fund
and
its
intention
to
subordinate
retirees'
reliance
interests
to
that
end
if
it
turned
out
that
the
exception
as
drafted
proved
to
be
invalid.
appellee
in
this
case
retired
from
the
united
states
postal
service
in
november
1977.
he
receives
a
government
pension.
in
december
1977,
he
submitted
an
application
for
spousal
benefits
based
on
the
work
record
of
his
wife
who
had
been
employed
in
a
covered
job;
that
is
it
was
covered
by
the
social
security
system,
and
who
was
insured
under
the
social
security
program.
appellee's
application
was
considered
to
be
filed
as
a
valid
application
as
of
january
1978
when
he
reached
the
age
of
62
and,
thus,
first
became
eligible
spousal
benefits.
the
social
security
administration
found
that
appellee
was
eligible
for
spousal
benefits.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
he
was
not
dependent.
because
he
filed
his
application
after
the
effective
date
of
the
offset
provision,
he
was
subject
to
the
offset
and
because,
and
it
is
undispute,
he
was
not
dependent
on
his
wife,
he
was
not
within
the
protection
of
the
exception
clause.
therefore,
in
the
end,
the
offset
applied
to
him,
and
because
the
amount
of
his
government
pension
exceeded
the
amount
of
his
spousal
benefits
the
offset
required
that
there
were
no
net
spousal
benefits
payable
to
him.
after
appellee
exhausted
his
administrative
remedies,
he
brought
this
action
under
section
405(g)
of
the
social
security
act.
the
district
court
struck
down
both
the
exception
provision
and
also
the
severability
clause.
the
court
found
that
the
exception
provision
incorporated
the
gender-based
dependency
test
that
existed
in
the
social
security
act
in
janury
1977
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
goldfarb.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
excuse
me?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that
the
act
did
incorporate,
absolutely.
appellee
has
raised
an
issue
of
statutory
construction
here
and
it
is
addressed
fully
in
our
brief.
i
don't
propose
to
discuss
it
unless
the
court
has
specific
questions
about
it.
but,
there
are
two
important
constitutional
issues.
the
first,
as
i
say,
is
that
the
district
court
struck
down
the
exception
clause
because
it
incorporated
the
gender-based
dependency
standard.
in
addition,
the
court
also
struck
down
the
severability
clause
because
the
severability
clause
required
that
the
offset
remain
in
effect
without
qualification,
and,
therefore,
a
plaintiff
who
successfully
challenged
the
exception
clause
would
not
receive
any
monetary
relief
in
the
form
of
unreduced
spousal
benefits.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
issue
of
the
exception
clause.
as
justice
white
points
out,
and
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
exception
does
incorporate
the
gender-based
dependency
test
that
existed
prior
to
goldfarb.
but,
a
gender-based
test
is
not
necessarily
invalid,
rather,
as
this
court's
decisions
have
recognized,
it
is
permissible
if
it
serves
an
important
governmental
objective
and
if
it
is
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
that
objective.
we
think
that
the
exception
clause
in
this
case
meets
both
of
those
criteria.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
that
is
correct,
and
it
actually
is
somewhat
more
complicated
than
that.
before
i
get
into
the
details,
let
me
say
that
in
the
end
it
does
include
a
gender
differentiation.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
on
the
burden
of
dependency,
that
is
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
there
are
both
men
and
women
who
are
benefited.
at
the
same
time,
there
are
men
who
are
not
benefited,
would
be
benefited
if
they
were
women.
and,
for
that
reason,
and
because
the
intent
of
congress
is
so
clear
argue
that
it
is
not
subject
to
review
as
a
gender-based
standard.
but,
to
follow
up
on
your
observation,
justice
stevens,
there
are
both
men
and
women
who
are
eligible
under
the
pre-goldfarb
law
and
their
reliance
interests
are
protected.
similarly,
because
of
the
effective
date
provision
of
the
act,
any
non-dependent
men
made
eligible
as
a
result
of
goldfarb,
who
filed
a
valid
application
for
benefits
prior
to
december
1977,
are
also
protected.
in
other
words,
they
are
not
subject
to
the
offset
by
virtue
of
the
effective
date
provision.
both
of
those
classes
are
protected.
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
there
is
one
group
of
women
who
are
not
eligible
for
benefits
under
pre-goldfarb
law
but
are
now
eligible
for
such
benefits.
that
is
the
group
of
divorced
wives
and
surviving
divorced
wives
who
were
married
more
than
ten
but
less
than
twenty
years.
because
they
were
not
eligible
under
pre-goldfarb
law,
they
do
not
come
within
the
exception,
and,
therefore,
are
subject
to
the
offset.
in
addition,
non-dependent
men
after
goldfarb
who
make
no
claim
of
reliance
on
that
decision,
who
were
unaware
of
it
or
admit
that
it
did
not
enter
into
their
thinking
at
all,
are
also
subject
to
the
offset.
they
had
no
reliance
interests
to
be
protected.
so,
there
are
men
and
women
on
both
sides
of
the
line
of
the
offset
and
the
distinguishing
characteristic
between
them
is
the
reliance
interests
of
the
category
in
which
they
fall.
the
protection
of
reliance
interests
as
those
lines
suggest
was
the
very
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
the
exception
provision.
congress
was
concerned
in
particular
about
the
reliance
interests
of
retirees
who
had
planned
their
retirements
in
accordance
with
the
long-standing
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
that
congress
had
passed
and
that
had
been
on
the
books
since
1939.
the
legislative
record
makes
clear
that
this
is
the
purpose
that
congress
actually
had
in
its
collective
mind
in
enacting
the
exception.
there
was
no
sexist
animus
or
motivation
on
the
part
of
congress
here.
congress
did
not
indulge
in
archaic
or
sterotypical
assumptions
about
the
role
of
women
in
our
society
and
did
not
adopt
the
exception
based
on
reflexive
or
uncritical
habit.
in
this
case,
congress
knew
full
well
what
it
was
doing
and
it
based
the
exception
on
the
historical
fact
of
reliance
pre-goldfarb
law.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
it
might
make
a
difference.
it
would
depend
in
part
on
why
congress
did
it
and
what
the
expansion
was.
but,
we
think,
if
anything,
the
five-year
period
was
on
the
short
rather
than
the
long
side
of
the
permissible
spectrum
given
the
nature
of
retirement
earnings.
someone
who
is
six
years
from
retirement
might
well
be
hard
pressed
in
that
relatively
short
period
of
time
to
make
up
the
reliance
that
has
been
bashed
as
a
result
of
the
offset.
but,
congress
felt
that
five
years
was
appropriate
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
determination
was
impermissible
in
any
way.
it
is
a
line-drawn
problem
inherent
in
the
situation.
it
is
not
itself
a
gender
issue.
now,
the
protection
of
these
reliance
interests
that
motivated
congress,
we
submit,
is
a
legitimate
and
important
governmental
interest.
we
think
that
proposition
is
sound
and
self-evident
on
its
face,
especially
given
the
nature
of
the
social
security
system
and
the
nature
of
the
retirement
planning
process.
i
also
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
a
wide
range
of
areas
have
recognized
reliance
interests
of
much
the
same
sort.
it
was
not
improper
for
congress
to
be
concerned
about
the
hardship
and
disruption
that
would
have
been
caused
if
the
new
offset
provision
were
applied
to
people
who
were
retired
or
close
to
retirement
and
who
had
planned
their
retirement
in
accordance
with
pre-goldfarb
law.
in
addition
to
that
purpose
being
important
and
legitimate,
we
also
submit
that
the
exception
clause
is
substantially
related
to
the
achievement
of
that
purpose
and
it
rests
on
a
reasoned
analysis
of
the
statutory
classification.
indeed,
by
incorporating
the
pre-goldfarb
law
in
the
exception
provision,
the
exception
is
precisely
suited
to
the
protection
of
that
reliance
interest.
in
addition,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
exception
is
limited
to
a
transitional
five-year
period
which
congress
determined
was
a
reasonable
time
to
protect
people
against
the
disruption
of
their
retirement
plans.
we
also
would
point
out
that
when
the
exception
clause
expired
by
its
own
terms
in
december
of
1982,
and,
thus,
the
pre-goldfarb
reliance
interests
had
then
been
satisfied,
congress
twice
reconsidered
the
offset
provision
and
on
both
occasions
it
enacted
an
gender-neutral
provision.
we
think
that
confirms
what
was
evident
in
the
initial
act,
that
congress
limited
the
gender-based
classification
to
what
was
necessary
to
protect
the
pre-goldfarb
reliance
interest.
finally,
in
enacting
the
exception
and
offset
in
1977,
congress
considered
other
alternatives,
but
it
rejected
them
as
less
desirable.
the
legislative
record
makes
it
clear
that
congress
adopted
the
offset
and
exception
provisions
as
a
deliberate
policy
choice
in
preference
to
other
approaches
they
might
have
taken.
now,
appellee
seeks
to
upset
congress'
policy
choice
and
makes
two
arguments
that
the
exception
is
unconstitutional.
first,
he
argues
that
the
protection
of
the
pre-goldfarb
reliance
interest
was
not
a
legitimate
and
important
governmental
objective.
as
congress
recognized
though,
and
we
think
it
quite
plain,
we
don't...
the
reliance
interests
of
people
under
the
prior
law,
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
passed
by
congress
and
in
effect
since
1939,
cannot
be
so
easily
dismissed.
such
reliance
is
not
discredited
in
any
way
by
the
fact
that
this
court
in
goldfarb
ultimately
held
the
statute
to
violate
equal
protection.
as
in
cases
such
as
lemon
versus
kurtzman
and
the
manhart
and
the
norris
decisions,
reliance
on
a
prior
state
of
the
law,
even
if
that
law
turned
out
eventually
to
be
improper
or
unconstitutional,
does
not
make
that
reliance
illegitimate
and
does
not
detract
from
the
importance
of
protecting
the
reliance
interests
that
arose
under
prior
law.
appellee
also
makes
a
second
argument
that
the
statutory
classification
here
is
underinclusive
because
it
doesn't
protect
the
asserted
reliance
interests
of
non-dependent
men
who
claim
to
have
relied
on
goldfarb
between
the
time
it
was
announced
in
march
of
1977,
and
the
enactment
of
the
offset
provisions
in
december
1977,
and
who
did
not
file
a
valid
application
for
spousal
benefits
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
offset,
december
1,
1977.
we
don't
think
that
congress
was
required,
however,
to
recognize
this
short-lived
and
new-found
reliance
interests
of
men
that
was
based
on
the
extension
of
benefits
following
goldfarb.
congress
could
conclude,
in
the
context
of
the
pressing
need
for
the
offset
itself...
and
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
offset
is
the
principal
provision
here
to
which
the
exception
is
a
specific
exemption...
in
that
context
congress
could
concluded
that
the
reliance
interest
advanced
by
appellee
was
less
substantial
and
less
deserving
of
protection
than
the
long-standing
reliance
interest
under
the
statute
passed
by
congress
prior
to
goldfarb.
as
justice
stevens
and
i
discussed
before,
there
are
men
and
women
on
both
sides
of
the
line.
the
interest
that
appellee
asserts
was
based
on
the
goldfarb
decision.
let
me
come
at
it
this
way.
that
was
a
very
recent
decision
at
the
time
and
congress
could
reasonably
have
concluded
that
it
was
unlikely
to
have
lead
to
widespread
and
significant
reliance.
in
addition,
it
was
possible,
as
in
fact
turned
out
to
be
the
case,
that
congress
would
pass
a
statute
in
response
to
the
goldfarb
decision
and
that
statute
would
affect
the
newly
recognized
claims
of
non-dependent
men
such
as
appellee.
neither
of
those
considerations
applies
to
the
reliance
interests
of
the
pre-goldfarb
retirees.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
statute
is
perfectly
constitutional
to
distinguish
between
those
groups
and
does
not
raise
any
constitutional
difficulties
because
it
is
limited
to
the
interest
that
congress
found
to
be
more
substantial
and
more
worthy
of
protection.
i
should
go
on
to
say
that
even
if
congress
was
required
to
accommodate
the
interest
in
some
way
that
appellee
asserts,
its
failure
to
do
so
does
not
establish
that
the
exception
clause
as
it
exists
is
not
substantially
related
to
the
protection
of
reliance
interests.
justice
stevens
and
i
discussed
before
the
somewhat
complicated
application
of
this
statute,
the
four
different
groups,
the
validity
of
which
appellee
doesn't
challenge.
the
only
group
that
appellee
raises
is
this
narrow
group
of
men
who
relied
between
goldfarb
and
the
enactment
of
the
offset
provision.
even
though
that
limited
group
was
not
taken
into
account,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
there
still
is
a
substantial
fit
between
the
exception
clause
and
the
protection
of
reliance
interests.
and,
in
assessing
the
substantiality
of
the
fit,
it
is
important
again
to
note
that
even
if
appellees
reliance
interest
had
to
be
included
at
all,
they
are
still
less
substantial
than
the
groups
that
are
now
protected
under
the
statute,
less
substantial
than
the
long-standing
reliance
interest
under
pre-goldfarb
law
and
they
are
less
substantial
than
the
interest
of
non-dependent
men
who
submitted
a
valid
application
and
were
receiving
or
were
entitled
to
receive
spousal
benefits
between
march
and
december
of
1977.
appellee's
standard
is
also
one
based
on
a
subjective
reliance
interest.
such
a
category
under
the
statute
would
constitute
a
marked
departure
from
the
easily
determined
objective
criteria
now
in
the
exception
and
the
offset
provisions
and
would
be
extremely
difficult
and
burdensome
for
the
government
to
administer
in
practice.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
think
the
exception
clause
itself
is
constitutional.
in
the
event
the
court
disagrees
with
that
submission,
however,
it
must
then
address
the
constitutionality
of
the
severability
clause,
which,
as
i
mentioned
before,
provides
that
if
the
exception
is
invalid
in
any
respect,
the
offset
will
remain
in
effect
without
qualification
and
the
exception
to
the
offset
will
be
eliminated
in
its
entirety
rather
than
extended
to
people
whom
congress
did
not
intend
to
be
within
it.
the
district
court
held
that
the
severability
clause
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
a
usurpation
of
judicial
authority
and,
therefore,
invalid
under
article
iii.
we
think
the
severability
clause
is
plainly
constitutional.
it
is
a
substantive
rule
of
law
governing
the
distribution
of
social
security
benefits.
it
is
a
rule
of
law
that
is
to
be
applied
in
the
event
that
the
exception
clause,
as
congress
drafted
it,
is
held
to
be
invalid.
the
severability
clause
reflects
congress'
overriding
concern
with
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
social
security
trust
fund
is
threatened
by
the
decision
in
goldfarb
and
it
indicates
congress'
intention
to
subordinate
retirees'
reliance
interests
to
that
paramount
end,
that
the
balance
struck
by
congress
in
the
exception
was
impermissible.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
this
is
a
severability
clause
in
the
usual
sense
in
two
ways.
first,
it
provides
that
the
offset
will
be
severed
in
its
entirety
and
remain
in
effect.
it
also
discusses
the
severability
of
the
exception
provision
and
provides
that
any
remaining
valid
portions
of
the
exception
will
not
be
severed.
the
severability
clause
does
not
always
have
to
be
in
favor
of
severability
we
don't
believe.
it
can
just
as
well,
and
as
congress
found
here,
be
in
favor
of
non-severability.
it
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
goal
for
congress
to
try
to
protect
the
social
security
trust
fund
from
great
liability
if
it
turned
out
that
it
could
not
limit
the
exception
to
the
group
of
people
that
it
considered
to
be
most
worthy
of
special
consideration.
now,
severability
is
a
question
of
legislative
intent.
in
essence,
it
is
a
statement
by
congress
of
the
statute
it
would
have
enacted,
what
it
would
have
done,
if
it
had
known
at
the
outset
that
the
statute
as
drafted
was
unconstitutional.
here,
congress
explicitly
and
clearly
defined
the
scope
of
the
statute
it
was
enacting
and
we
think
it
acted
well
within
its
legislative
powers
in
so
doing.
in
addition,
the
severability
clause
is
also
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicating
that
an
under
inclusive
statute
can
be
remedied
either
by
extension
or
by
nullification
of
its
benefits.
either
approach
is
constitutionally
adequate
and
the
choice
between
those
remedial
alternatives
is
a
question
of
legislative
intent
and
that
congress
indicated
its
intent
clearly
here
does
not
render
the
severability
clause
suspect
or
invalid.
i
would
only
note
in
closing
that
the
district
court
felt
that
there
was
an
article
iii
standing
problem
in
the
severability
clause.
the
severability
clause
is
a
rule
of
law
and
does
not
purport
to
effect
the
article
iii
power
or
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
in
addition,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
standing
of
appellee
or
any
other
plaintiff.
appellee
has
standing
because
he
was
subject
to
the
offset
and
not
within
the
exception.
in
any
event,
there
is
no
rule
of
law
that
says
a
plaintiff
has
to
be
entitled
to
monetary
relief
in
order
to
have
standing.
on
the
contrary,
we
think
appellee
unquestionably
had
standing,
notwithstanding
the
severability
clause,
to
pursue
his
right
to
equal
treatment.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
