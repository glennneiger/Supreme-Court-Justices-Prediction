mr.
victor
e.
grimm
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
autonomously
operated
parent
and
subsidiary
corporations
acted
in
concert
to
exclude
a
new
competitor
from
the
market.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
there
certainly
is
a
distinction
that
is
made
in
the
statute.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
if
there
had
not
been
a
separate
corporation,
there
would
not
be
a
section
1
claim
particularly
because
the
statute
requires
the
existence
of
two
separate
legal
persons
which
this
court
has
always
held.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
as
a
threshold
matter.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there...
it
was
somewhat
conflicting
evidence
in
the
record
on
this
point.
the
petitioners
gave
some
testimony
to
the
effect
that
there
were
tax
considerations.
they
wanted
to
avoid
some
state
tax.
there
was
also
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
copperweld
corporation
wanted
it
subsidiaries
to
stand
on
their
own
two
feet,
to
be,
in
effect,
independent
businesses
in
the
competitive
market.
the
question
essentially
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
anticompetitive
conduct
engaged
in
by
petitioners
should
now
be
excused
from
antitrust
coverage?
there
are
three
basic
points
which
i
should
like
to
address
bearing
upon
this
issue.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute,
including
its
legislative
history,
and
the
proper
distinction
between
corporate
divisions
and
subsidiaries,
as
well
as
the
relationship
between
sections
1
and
2
of
the
statute.
secondly,
the
applicable
supreme
court
decisions
which
uniformly
conclude
that
concerted
anticompetitive
conduct
can
come
within
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and,
third,
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied
in
cases
of
this
kind.
but,
first
there
are
a
couple
of
observations
which
i
believe
are
important
concerning
the
facts
of
this
case.
first,
there
was
simply
no
question
but
that
the
acts
of
petitioners
caused
the
complete
exclusion
of
a
competitor
from
a
market
for
a
substantial
period
of
time.
that
exclusion
resulted
in
a
clearly
demonstrated
restraint
of
trade
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
price
competition
was
frustrated,
product
supply
was
reduced
during
a
period
of
serious
product
shortage.
these
facts
are
important,
we
submit,
because
this
court
has
always
held
that
the
sherman
act
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
its
fundamental
objective;
that
is
preservation
of
competition.
in
this
instance,
the
acts
of
petitioners
seriously
undermined
that
objective.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there
would
not
have
been
liability
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
because,
as
we
point
out,
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
deals
solely
with
the
question
of
the
activity
of
separate
legal
persons.
that
is
a
threshold
requirement
of
section
1
of
the
statute.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
consequences
of
the
action
are
significant
for
this
reason,
because
the
fundamental
objective,
as
we
point
out
of
the
sherman
act,
is
the
preservation
of
competition.
therefore,
the
language
of
the
sherman
act,
we
suggest,
should
be
interpreted
to
apply
to
those
situations
where
it
properly
can
be
so
interpreted
based
upon
that
language
if
there
has,
in
fact,
been
a
subversion
of
competition.
this,
we
would
point
out,
is
not
simply
a
case
of
an
isolated
interference
with
contract.
there
were
broad
scale
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
here
to
induce
and
to
coerce
other
firms
to
refrain
from
with
dealing
with
independence
tube
corporation.
for
example,
when
regal
learned
that
independence
would
be
entering
the
market
as
a
competitor,
it
recruited
copperweld
to
help
take
action
in
response
to
independence's
impending
entry.
the
petitioners--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--the
mechanism
may
or
may
not
have
been
different.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
control
would
have
have
been...
may
have
been
considerably
different,
that
is
control
by
the
parent
of
its
subsidiary.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
evidence
in
this
case
demonstrated
that
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
common
directors
and
officers,
the
real
decisions,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
both
in
day-to-day
operations
and
in
major
policy
decisions,
were
made
at
the
subsidiary
level.
indeed,
the
subsidiary
functioned
essentially
as
a
separate
business
unit
even
though
there
were
common
directors.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
divisions
may
function
with
some
autonomy.
the
distinction
between
a
subsidiary
and
a
division
comes
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
this
court
has
always
interpreted
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
to
require
the
existence
of
two
separate
legal
persons.
an
unincorporated
division
is
not
a
separate
legal
person
and,
therefore,
would
be
incapable
of
meeting
that
threshold
requirement.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
there
is
some
historical
explanation
to
that
distinction
as
well.
in
1890,
of
course,
congress
was
aware
of
corporations
and,
indeed,
of
affiliated
corporations,
but
autonomous
or
even
the
existence
of
unincorporated
divisions
did
not
exist
in
1890.
the
statute
was
framed
to
be
directed
toward
those
kinds
of
entities
which
did
exist.
so,
the
language
itself
drew
the
line...
the
statute
itself
drew
the
line
on
the
basis
of
independent
entity,
business
entity
and
along
the
line
of
the
concepts
of
common
law
conspiracy
which,
of
course,
also
requires
the
existence
of
two
separate
legal
persons.
there
seems
to
be,
we
would
submit,
some
substance
to
this
distinction
as
well.
an
unincorporated
division,
while
it
may,
as
your
honor
points
out,
exists
with
significant
autonomy,
nevertheless,
there
are
some
important
things
that
an
unincorporated
division
is
not
capable
of
doing
which
has
significance
in
the
market
place.
an
unincorporated
division
is
incapable
of
engaging
in
a
contract
in
its
own
name
and
in
its
own
identity.
it
is
incapable
of
engaging
in
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
or
otherwise.
so,
we
would
submit
that
there
is
some
logic
drawing
the
line
where
the
statute
seems
to
draw
the
line
and
that
is
on
the
basis
of
legal
entity,
because
an
unincorporated
division
in
reality
cannot
perform
all
on
the
functions
that
a
separately
incorporated
legal
entity
can
by
virtue
of
the
legal
privileges
which
the
law
attributes
to
separate
incorporation.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
was
substantially
the
fact
here.
the
important
inquiry,
we
submit,
is
that
one
look
at
the
realities
of
the
operation.
are
the--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--are
the
officers
really
performing
a
function
of
running
the
business,
the
officers
of
the
parent
that
is,
or
is
the
business
really
being
run,
as
in
this
case,
by
either
officers
of
the
subsidiary
or
by
executive--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--and,
the
inquiry,
i
would
submit
where
there
are
identical
officers
is
whether
the
officers
are
dominating
the
operation
of
both
corporations
in
day-to-day
operations
and
in
policy
decisions
or
whether,
in
fact,
the
actual
operation
of
the
subsidiary
is
run
by
those
who
are
not
running
the
parent
corporation
which
is
the
case
here.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
the
district
court
as
well,
identified
a
number
of
factors
which
determines
whether
or
not
corporations
are
being
run
with
real
and
substantive
autonomy.
it
identifies
a
list
of
factors
which
professor
sullivan,
in
his
antitrust
treatise
identified,
which
considers
such
matters
as
who
is
really
making
the
decisions
as
to
the
long-term
planning
of
this
corporation?
is
it
the
parent
or
is
it
someone
at
the
subsidiary
who
is
not
a
part
of
the
parent?
are
the
other
day-to-day
activities--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--no,
they
wouldn't
be
hostile.
it
is
really
a
question--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--that
they
could
be?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that
they
would
be
hostile.
i
would
think
that
they
may
perform--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--well,
they
would
be
cooperative
certainly.
i
think
the
important
point--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--well,
i
would
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
the
joint
appendix
which
sets
forth
an
affidavit
at
page
a-103
which
is
the
affidavit
of
the
general
manager
of
regal
tube
company
in
which
he
identifies
all
of
the
activities
in
which
he
has
sole
responsibility
for
operation
of
the
subsidiary
corporation
and
that
it
is
not
the
board
of
directors
in
that
sense
who
was
running
the
corporation
either
in
terms
of
long-term
policy
decisions
or
in
terms
of
day-to-day
activities.
so,
the
question
is
who
is
really
running
the
corporation
as
an
actual
matter
of
reality
as
distinguished
from
who
might
ultimately
have
the
power
to
change
the
corporate
setup
or
to
even
sell
the
stock
of
the
corporation
at
some
point?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
in
this
case,
the
general
manager
of
the
subsidiary
was
solely
responsible
for
developing
a
profit
for
the
subsidiary
corporation.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
who
receives
the
profit?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
parent
corporation
by
virtue
of
its
stock
ownership
would
ultimately
benefit
from
that
profit,
of
course.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
the
consolidated
tax
returns,
i
believe,
were
filed.
i
believe
that
sec
requirements
compelled
the
filing
of
consolidated--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--they
were
filed
in
accordance
with
the
sec
requirements
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there
were
some
restrictions,
although
again
there
is
conflicting
evidence
on
this
point.
the
general
manage
of
the
subsidiary
had
the
authority
to
make
capital
expenditures
up
to
a
certain
level.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
there
is
conflicting
evidence
on
what
the
level
was.
ten
thousand
dollars
was
one
of
the
points
of
testimony.
but,
the
general--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--in
capital
expenditures.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
that
was
the
limitation
solely
on
capital
expenditures
without
approval.
now,
in
terms
of
other
activities,
he
had
complete
authority
and
complete
responsibility
for
making
a
profit.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
both
day-to-day
operations
and,
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
policy
decisions,
long-range
planning.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
pardon
me?
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
policy
decisions
with
respect
to
planning
new
products
and
introducing
new
products,
developing
new
products,
policy
decisions
with
respect
to
establishing
new
facilities,
policy
decisions
with
respect
to
identifying
corporate
acquisitions
to
be
made,
policy--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--well,
the
corporate
acquisitions
would
have
been
subject
to
approval,
but
he
was
essentially
responsible
for
identifying
and
developing
those
opportunities.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
it
presumably
would
be
depending--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--certainly
a
division
can
be
established
in
that
way.
i
have
no
question
about
that.
i
think
that
on
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
subsidiary,
there
are
a
number
of
case
of
this
court
which
are
instructive
on
whether
or
not
a
combination
can
exist
in
a
situation
where
there
is
influence
of
dominance
or
coercion
between
the
parties.
this
court
in
the
case
of
albrecht
versus
the
herald
company,
for
example,
held
in
a
case
that
involved
a
principal
and
an
agent
where
the
agent
is
under
the
total
dominance
and
control
of
the
principal
and
carries
out
an
anticompetitive
objective,
that
the
principal
and
the
agent,
even
though
the
agent
is
totally
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
principal,
but
is
nevertheless
a
separate
legal
entity.
if
an
anticompetitive
restraint
is
worked,
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
combination
where
the
agent
materially
aided
in
the
advancement
of
that
objective.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
is
there
any
decision--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--there
are
a
number
of
cases
which
hold
that
corporate
affiliation
is
not
a
defense.
and,
beginning
really
with
the
standard
oil
case
and
coming
down
all
the
way
to
the
perma
life
case.
yellow
cab--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
enough
to
make
out
a
violation.
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
here
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--i
think
that
timken,
kiefer-stewart,
yellow
cab--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--absolutely.
in
timken
versus
the
united
states,
for
example,
this
court
was
presented
with
the
issue
that
is
exactly
the
same
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case.
in
that
holding,
this
court
said,
and
i
quote
the
following
language.
in
precisely
the
same
issue
involved
in
that
case
over
30
years,
this
court
said,
"if
such
a
drastic
change
is
to
be
made
in
the
statute,
congress
is
the
one
to
do
it.
"
that
is
341
u.s.
599.
i
should
like
to
turn
next
to
a
brief
discussion
of
the
legislative
history,
because
we
submit
that
it
bears...
it
sheds
light
on
this
question.
but,
even
before
that,
i
think
it
is
important
to
refer
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
which
provides
every
contract
combination
in
the
form
of
a
trust
or
otherwise
or
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
is
declared
to
be
illegal.
here
the
petitioners
were,
indeed,
separate
corporations.
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
a
threshold
requirement.
here
it
has
been
concluded
unquestionably
that
petitioners'
activities
resulted
in
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
under
a
rule
of
reasoned
analysis.
the
language
of
the
statute
was
plainly
violated.
we
submit
that
the
basic
objectives
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history
support
this
conclusion.
congress
was
clearly
concerned
about
the
predatory
efforts
to
prevent
new
competitors
from
entering
into
the
market.
congress
also,
i
believe,
made
it
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
affiliated
corporations
were
indeed
within
the
meaning
of
the
combination
and
conspiracy
language
of
the
statute.
in
1890,
of
course,
congress
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
anticompetitive
behavior
of
the
trusts,
but
congress
considered
those
trusts
to
be
the
manifestation
of
a
more
fundamental
problem
at
which
the
statute
was
aimed.
that
problem
was
the
suppression
of
competition
by
any
form
of
concerted
action.
senator
sherman
made
it
clear
that
the
primary
concern
of
the
sherman
act
was
not
with
the
creation
of
combinations
by
merger
or
otherwise,
but
with
the
anticompetitive
acts
in
which
those
combinations
engaged.
the
words
of
senator
sherman
during
the
legislative
debates,
i
think,
are
apt
for
this
particular
case
when
he
said
that
if
a
humble
man
starts
in
business
in
opposition
to
them,
they
will
drive
him
down,
they
will
crowd
him
down.
then
it
is
the
duty
of
the
courts
to
intervene
and
that
is
the
kind
of
activity
involved
here,
that
is
the
kind
of
activity
that
senator
sherman
was
concerned
about.
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
trusts
of
1890
were
themselves
groups
of
corporations
under
common
ownership.
the
trust
device
was
nothing
more
than
a
group
of
commonly-owned
corporations
in
which
a
group
of
trustees
owned
all
of
the
stock.
the
trusts,
however,
were
evolving
into
the
holding
company
even
in
1890,
which
is
why
congress
framed
the
statute
to
cover
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
combinations
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise.
indeed,
i
believe
that
it
is
very
important
in
interpreting
the
word
1890.
what
did
the
framers
of
the
statute
think
the
term
"combination"
meant?
indeed,
that
term
was
a
commonly
understood
and
well-used
term.
in
its
simplest
form,
it
meant
nothing
more
than
the
cooperation
of
two
or
more
persons
to
achieve
a
given
result.
the
framers
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
we
submit,
meant
to
use
that
term
as
it
was
commonly
used
at
the
time
and
that
is
a
combination
meant
any
form
of
a
collection
of
persons
or
as
the
trust
were
a
collection
of
corporations
which,
when
they
engaged
in
a
restraint
of
trade,
could
be
held
to
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
in
light
of
this
legislative
history,
this
court
has
so
held
in
each
and
every
case
that
has
been
presented
to
it
which
involved
this
issue.
i
should
like
to
for
a
moment
direct
my
attention
to
the
relationship
between
section
1
and
section
2
of
the
statute.
both
sections
deal
with
combinations
or
conspiracy.
section
2
is
not
limited
to
individual
conduct.
indeed,
the
language
of
section
2,
i
submit,
is
instructive
as
to
the
meaning
of
combination
or
conspiracy
under
section
1.
section
2
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
the
combination
element
provides
every
person...
and
person
is
defined
to
include
corporations.
so,
if
one
reads
section
2
substituting
the
word
2
says
every
corporation
who
shall
combine
or
conspire
with
any
other
corporation
may
violate
the
statute.
we
submit
that
congress
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
section
2,
of
course,
also
concerns
attempts
by
individual
persons
to
attempt
to
monopolize.
the
petitioners
and
the
government
in
this
case
have
suggested
that
this
court
should
now
hold
that
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
that
part
of
section
2
which
relates
solely
to
attempts
to
monopolize
by
single
persons,
should
henceforth
be
applied
and
only
applied...
the
only
section
of
the
sherman
act
to
be
applied
to
restraints
of
trade
among
affiliated
corporations.
we
submit
that
that
approach
strains
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
but,
there
is
a
more
important
and
fundamental
point
here.
that
is
that
the
government's
position...
that
is
the
attempt
to
monopolize
section
should
only
be
applied
to
these
circumstances
would,
in
effect,
exempt
these
kinds
of
activities
from
the
sherman
act
for
this
reason,
because
section
2,
the
attempt
to
monopolize
portion
of
section
2
has
always
been
held
by
the
courts
or
at
least
in
recent
years
to
apply
only
in
those
situations
in
which
there
is
a
dangerous
probability
of
achieving
monopoly
as
measured
by
substantial
market
shares.
that
would
mean
in
this
particular
case
where
two
corporations
are
engaged
in
different
markets,
neither
one
of
which
having
a
dominant
position
in
either
market,
nevertheless
combine
their
activities
to
suppress
competition
of
third
parties,
that
that
activity
would
be
automatically
exempt
from
antitrust
coverage.
i
should
like--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--that
is
correct.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
well,
what
it
decides
is
that
it
is
within
the
scope
of
section
1.
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
it
is
a
preliminary...
it
is
a
threshold
question.
and,
beyond
that
it
is
important,
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs,
to
apply
a
substantive
standard.
and,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
standard
which
is
appropriate
in
these
cases
is
the
standard
which
is
derived
from
the
decisions
of
this
court.
when
presented
with
issues
of
this
kind
in
the
past,
this
court
has
concluded
that
there
are
two
factors
which
should
be
considered,
the
effect
of
the
activities
of
the
parties
involved
on
competition
and
also
the
operational
realities
of
those
parties.
the
lower
courts
have
applied
this
doctrine
and
these
concepts
not
always
with
the
greatest
precision
we
would
agree,
but
the
results
of
the
lower
court
cases
are
essentially
consistent
with
the
two-part
analysis
which
says
that
whether
affiliated
corporations
should
be
held
to
have
violated
the
statute
should
turn
upon
two
factors,
whether
they
actually
functioned
in
the
market
place
in
reality
as
two
distinct
economic
units
and,
secondly,
whether
each
corporation
undertook
activities
to
suppress
the
trade
of
third
parties.
and,
as
i
point
out,
this
is
a
threshold
inquiry.
it
is
designed
to
determine
whether
those
corporations
are
capable
of
engaging
in
an
antitrust
violation
and
not
in
whether
an
antitrust
violation
actually
occurred.
in
addition
to
that
threshold
inquiry,
it
would
be
necessary
to
determine
that
those
parties
actually
formed
a
conspiracy
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
under
the
cases
relating
to
conspiracy
and
it
would
also
be
necessary
to
establish
that
anticompetitive
acts
were
undertaken
to
destroy
the
competition
of
a
third
party.
the
aspect
which
relates
to
the
autonomy
of
operation
is
designed
to
determine
whether,
as
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
there
is
enough
separation
so
that
it
is
sensible
to
treat
those
two
separate
legal
units
as
separate
economic
units
under
the
sherman
act.
when
a
separate
corporation
is
functioning
as
separate
economic
entity
into
the...
in
the
market
place
it
enters
into
contracts
and
other
business
arrangements
which
give
it
some
economic
influence.
when
that
economic
influence
is
combined
with
another
separate
corporation
even
though
an
affiliated
corporation--
mr.
victor
e.
grimm
--the
evidence
showed
that,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
was
an
affidavit,
among
a
substantial
amount
of
other
evidence,
which
showed
that,
in
fact,
as
general
manager
of
the
subsidiary
had
the
sole
responsibility
for
operating
the
subsidiary.
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
that
question
very
specifically
and
in
a
detailed
way
based
upon
all
the
evidence
presented.
that
was
precisely
one
of
the
issues
that
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
petitioners.
was
there
enough
autonomy
to
meet
that
test
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
be
considered
separate
economic
units?
the
district
court
in
the
post-trial
motions
and
the
court
of
appeals
all
concluded
that
there
was
sufficient
and
substantial
autonomy
both
in
day-to-day
operations
and
in
policy
decisions.
the
second
aspect
of
the
test
relates
to
the
effect
of
the
activities
on
third
parties,
whether
or
not
significant
restraints
of
trade
are
imposed
on
third
parties.
in
this
case,
an
unreasonable
suppression
of
competition
did
occur.
the
sherman
act
was
clearly
intended
to
protect
competition
against
such
competitive
assaults.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
