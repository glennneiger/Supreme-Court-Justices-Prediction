mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
seventh
circuit.
it
is
an
antitrust
case
turning
on
the
construction
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
put
briefly
the
issue
is
whether
a
corporation
and
its
wholly-owned
subsidiary
can
provide
the
two
parties
necessary
to
provide
a
combination
or
conspiracy
under
section
1.
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
here
is
the
petitioner
regal
tube
company
which
the
other
petitioner
copperweld
purchased
in
1972.
regal
was
a
small
manufacturer
of
structural
steel
tubing
with
about
14
percent
of
the
market.
structural
steel
tubing
is
used
to
support
buildings,
machinery,
and
the
like.
copperweld
was
never
in
this
business
and
did
not
compete
with
regal.
copperweld
manufactures,
among
other
things,
wire
and
cable
and
tubing
which
is
used
to
transport
gases
and
liquids.
upon
purchasing
regal,
copperweld
caused
it
to
be
organized
as
a
separate
subsidiary
for
tax
purposes.
all
of
the
stock
in
regal
was
owned
by
copperweld.
all
of
regal's
officers
and
directors
were
copperweld's
officers
and
directors
and
regal's
corporate
headquarters
are
in
pittsburgh
with
copperweld.
the
regal
business
had
been
previously
owned
by
lear
siegler,
inc.,
a
california
company.
it
had
been
run
as
an
unincorporated
division.
david
grohne,
one
of
the
counterdefendants
below,
was
president
of
the
regal
division
under
lear
siegler.
just
before
regal
was
sold
to
copperweld,
grohne
accepted
a
position
as
lear
siegler's
corporate
secretary.
within
a
few
months
though,
grohne
decided
to
establish
his
own
steel
tubing
business.
in
may
1972,
he
formed
the
respondent
independence
tube
corporation
which
sought
bids
on
tubing
mills
from
manufacturers.
by
october
1972,
his
new
company
gave
an
order
for
the
delivery
of
a
tubing
mill
and
the
supplier
was
yoder
company
which
was
one
of
the
defendants
below.
the
petitioners,
with
the
advice
of
counsel,
sent
out
letters
designed
to
protect
copperweld's
interest
in
designs,
plans,
drawings,
and
trade
secrets
and
to
prevent
third
parties
from
developing
reliance
interests
in
dealing
with
independence.
one
of
these
letters
was
sent
to
yoder.
yoder
then
cancelled
its
acceptance
of
the
purchase
order
for
a
tubing
mill.
however,
independence
found
another
supplier
which
furnished
the
mill
and
the
respondent
independence
commenced
operations
in
september
1974,
nine
months
later
than
would
have
happened
if
yoder
had
delivered
the
tubing
mill
originally
ordered.
the
present
suit
was
commenced
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
in
1976.
it
contained
three
counts.
the
first
of
these
was
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
it
alleged
that
copperweld
and
regal,
together
with
phillip
smith,
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
both
companies,
had
conspired
with
yoder
to
restrict
trade
in
the
market
for
structural
steel
tubing.
the
second
count
alleged
that
the
petitioners
and
smith
had
attempted
to
monopolize
the
market
for
steel
tubing
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
and
the
third
count
alleged
that
the
petitioners
and
smith
had
interfered
with
the
respondent's
contractual
relations
with
yoder,
a
state
law
tort.
before
the
trial
began,
the
respondent
dismissed
this
claim
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
that
is
the
attempt-to-monopolize
claim.
it
also
dismissed
smith
from
all
counts
in
which
he
was
named.
the
case
thus
went
to
trial
on
two
counts,
one
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
alleging
a
conspiracy
between
copperweld,
regal,
and
yoder,
and
the
other
alleging
a
state
law
tort
of
interference
with
contractual
relations.
at
the
trial,
the
jury
found
that
copperweld
and
regal
had
conspired
to
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
but,
it
likewise
found
that
yoder
was
not
involved
in
the
conspiracy.
it
also
found
that
copperweld,
but
not
regal,
had
interfered
with
the
respondent's
contractual
relationship
with
yoder.
the
jury
found
damages
on
the
interference
with
contract
claim
in
the
amount
of
nearly
$2.5
million.
that
issue
is
no
longer
in
dispute.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
tort
liability
is
also
an
antitrust
liability
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
with
the
damages
consequently
tripled
under
the
antitrust
laws.
the
question
at
the
heart
of
this
case
has
a
long
history,
going
back
at
least
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
yellow
cab
case
in
1947.
the
court's
opinion
there
said
that
an
unreasonable
restraint
may
result
as
readily
from
a
conspiracy
among
those
who
are
affiliated
or
integrated
under
common
ownership
as
from
a
conspiracy
among
those
who
are
otherwise
independent.
nearly
everyone
is
agreed
that
those
words
were
unnecessary
to
the
result
in
that
case,
but
as
professor
areeda
has
said,
the
court's
language
has
come
to
have
an
independent
significance.
that
is,
indeed,
somewhat
surprising
since
the
yellow
cab
case
is
really
one
of
those
phantom
cases
for
the
defendants
there
eventually
prevailed.
when
the
case
went
back
to
district
court
for
retrial,
that
court
found
that
the
operating
companies
had
not
been
acquired
unlawfully
and
the
resulting
judgment
for
the
defendants
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
since
then
the
problem
in
various
forms
has
come
here
in
a
number
of
cases.
these
are
discussed
fully
in
the
briefs
of
the
parties.
i
rely
on
all
of
the
arguments
there
but
perhaps
i
can
make
a
contribution
by
emphasizing
one
aspect
of
our
approach.
the
antitrust
arguments
treat
the
question
on
a
broad
canvas.
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
like
the
tax
laws
which
spin
everything
out
in
great
detail
so
that
the
role
of
the
courts
if
often
to
try
to
fit
the
precisely-stated
provisions
together
somewhat
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle.
in
the
antitrust
field,
the
statutory
provisions
are
general
and
much
of
the
law
has
been
made
by
the
courts,
particularly
by
this
court.
because
of
the
need
for
this
general
approach
in
many
antitrust
cases,
it
may
have
been
overlooked
that
the
decision
in
this
case
can
best
be
obtained
by
focusing
on
what
the
statute
does
say
and
specifically
on
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
section
1
and
section
2
are
quoted
on
page
two
of
our
brief,
the
blue-covered
brief,
and
careful
consideration
of
their
words
will,
i
suggest,
help
to
resolve
the
issue
here.
section
1
relates
to
concerted
action,
the
kind
of
risk
which
lies
behind
the
concept
of
conspiracy
and
the
criminal
law.
every
contract
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
conspiracy
shall
be
illegal.
all
of
these
words
contemplate
multiple
actors.
it
takes
two
to
tango
and
it
takes
at
least
two
to
make
the
sort
of
contract
or
combination
or
to
enter
into
a
conspiracy
of
the
sort
with
which
congress
was
concerned.
section
2
is
the
standard
anti-remedy
for
misconduct
by
a
single
actor,
but
it
requires
a
monopoly
or
dangerous
probability
of
monopoly.
neither
is
present
here
since
regal
had
only
14
percent
of
the
relevant
market.
moreover,
as
i
have
said,
the
count
based
on
section
2
was
dismissed
before
trial
by
the
district
judge.
now
let
us
look
closely
at
section
1.
it
is
said
that
there
are
two
entities,
the
parent
and
its
wholly-own
subsidiary.
i
suggest
that
section
1
is
properly
construed
to
apply
only
when
there
are
two
or
more
parties
who
are
acting
independently
of
each
other.
section
1,
based
as
it
was
on
the
history
of
standard
oil,
focuses
on
the
increased
economic
power,
the
increased
threat
to
competition
which
results
from
the
joining
together
of
two
or
more
independent
centers
of
initiative
and
finance
through
combination
in
restraint
of
trade
and
that
is,
indeed,
the
construction
which
has
been
given
to
the
statute
in
analogous
circumstances.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that
no
matter
how
the
intraenterprise
organization
is
carried
out,
the
subsidiary
is
always
subject
to
the
complete
control
of
the
parent.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
we
don't
need
to
decide
that
question
here.
here
is
it
wholly
owned.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
would
think
that
a
good
approach
would
be
in
such
a
case
when
it
comes
up
that
if
the
corporation
was
subject
to...
if
the
subsidiary
was
subject
to
the
legal
control
of
the
parent,
that
the
same
rule
ought
to
apply.
there
may
well
be
different
factors
applicable
in
those
cases.
this
is
a
case
of
100
percent
complete
ownership.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
on
the
position
which
i
am
advancing,
regal
would
still
be
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
of
copperweld.
it
could
have
been
that
certain
of
the
individuals
who
work
in
connection
with
regal
made
that
agreement
with
the
individuals
who
worked
in
connection
with
copperweld,
but
they
always
remain
subject
to
the
control
of
copperweld
and,
moreover,
that
is
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
officers
and
directors
of
the
two
companies
were
the
same
and
there
was
no
such
agreement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
my
argument,
but
we
don't
need
to
go
quite
that
far
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
almost--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--you
would
have
to
say
that
some
of
your
language
used
in
earlier
opinions
was
not
required
for
the
decisions
in
those
cases
and
may
have
been
too
broad,
and
as
so
often
happens
in
the
development
of
law,
should
now
be
qualified.
it
is
not
unlike
the
situation
which
you
did
handle
in
the
gte
sylvania
case
which
was
just
referred
to,
not
to
mention
the
genesee
chief,
erie
railroad
and
tompkins
and
a
good
many
other
cases.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
do
i
think--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--the
only
one
that
worries
me
is
kiefer-stewart.
i
think
all
of
the
writers...
and
the
writers
are
all
opposed
to
the
sweeping
scope
of
some
of
this
court's
statements.
i
think
all
of
the
writers
are
agreed
that
the
cases,
including
yellow
cab,
are
rather
readily
distinguishable
except
possibly
kiefer-stewart.
however,
the
consequence
of
kiefer-stewart,
as
in
timpken
and
in
some
other
cases,
is
simply
that
the
company
converted
its
wholly-owned
subsidiary
into
a
division
and
that
is
the
way
it
has
continued
since.
and,
it
makes
no
antitrust
nor
academic
sense
to
say
that
there
can
be
a
conspiracy
with
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary,
but
not
with
a
division.
and,
the
court
can
rely
on
one
of
its
own
decisions
in
reaching
this
result
for
in
sunkist
against
winckler
and
smith
the
court
said
that
it
was
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
three
interrelated
entities
can
be
considered
independent
parties
for
the
purposes
of
the
conspiracy
provisions
of
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
court's
answer
was
we
conclude
not.
there
is
further
reference
in
the
opinion
of
the
fact
that
the
entities
were
not
independent
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
key
to
this
decision.
for
example--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--i
believe
it
was.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
believe
it
was
cited
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
so
at
least
it
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
so,
though
it
is
a
somewhat
complicated
matter.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
am
sorry,
madam
justice,
i
would
have
to
refresh
myself
on
parke-davis.
now,
it
is
held
that
the
officers
and
employees,
who
are
surely
separate
entities,
cannot
form
the
plurality
of
actors
required
for
a
conspiracy
under
section
1.
and,
the
reason,
of
course,
is
that
they
aren't
independent.
and,
similarly,
the
courts
have
held
that
the
contract,
combination,
or
conspiracy
can't
be
met
by
agreement
between
the
corporation
and
an
unincorporated
division.
a
division
of
a
company
may
have
economic
reality.
one
thinks
of
chevrolet
or
buick
and
the
courts
have
not
had
trouble
treating
other
unincorporated
associations
as
entities
for
other
purposes
of
the
law
such
a
partnerships
or
labor
unions
or,
i
may
say,
scrap
at
georgetown
law
school.
is
it
not
the
subservience
of
a
division?
it
is
lack
of
independence
which
is
the
significant
factor
here.
at
this
point
it
said
the
subsidiary
is
incorporated
and
that
makes
it
a
separate
entity.
when
i
was
in
law
school,
reliance
on
such
an
argument
was
already
somewhat
old-fashioned.
it
was
called
conceptualism,
for
it
makes
the
result
follow
from
a
legal
category
without
regard
to
the
substance
of
the
transaction.
such
a
result
is
purely
formalistic,
mechanical,
and
fortuitous.
in
particular,
the
distinction
between
corporation
and
division
is
quite
without
any
substantive
antitrust
significance.
more
than
28
years
ago
the
attorney
general's
committee
to
study
the
antitrust
laws
and
commenting
on
the
yellow
cab
opinion
observed...
and
this
is
in
part
in
answer
to
the
question
of
justice
brennan...
they
said
it
is
obviously
unrealistic
to
expect
or
to
command
wholly-owned
affiliates
to
compete.
most
of
the
difficulty
in
the
lower
courts
in
these
cases
have
come
from
the
fact
that
they
have
been
unable,
in
the
words
of
chief
judge
cummings
below,
to
re-examine
the
intracorporate
conspiracy
doctrine
root
and
branch.
we
submit
that
it
should
be
re-examined
here
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
may
i
say
to
justice
o'connor,
my
colleague,
mr.
baker,
calls
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
parke-davis
case
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
and
it
is
a
vertical
price
fixing
case
which
seems
to
be
somewhat
different
from
this.
