mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
purpose
of
the
sherman
act
is
to
promote
competition,
not,
of
course,
for
competition's
own
sake,
but,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
northern
pacific
and
broadcast
music,
as
a
means
to
encourage
efficiency
in
the
use
of
resources
for
the
ultimate
economic
benefit
of
the
society
as
a
whole.
section
2
of
the
act,
the
act's
build-in
paradox,
preserves
competition
by
prohibiting
competitive
behavior
that
threatens
monopolization.
that
behavior
is
prohibited
whether
engaged
in
individually
or
by
collaboration
and
regardless
of
the
form
of
internal
organization
the
transgressing
enterprise
has
adopted.
and,
section
2's
limitations
on
competitive
behavior
are
supplemented
by
the
prohibition
of
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
by
state
unfair
trade
practice
laws
such
as
we
have
seen
in
this
case,
the
tort
action
for
interference
with
contractual
relations,
for
interference
with
business
relations,
or
for
business
slander.
all
of
these
as
well
apply
regardless
of
whether
there
has
been
collaboration
and
regardless
of
the
form
of
internal
business
organization
that
has
been
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
frequently,
but
there
is
potential
for
use
there
that
could
go
beyond
section
2.
the
basic
principle
of
antitrust
is
that
within
these
relatively
peripheral
limitations
on
its
individual
behavior,
each
enterprise
will
be
spurred
on
by
the
much
more
extensive
prohibitions
on
collaboration
to
compete
and,
thereby,
to
achieve
greater
economic
efficiencies,
whether
those
efficiencies
are
in
scientific
or
technological
advance,
in
product
design,
in
improved
distribution
methods,
or
in
improvements
in
management
such
as
better
utilization
of
personnel
or
changes
in
the
form
of
internal
business
organization.
now,
laws
with
other
objectives
such
as
securities
laws
or
state
corporation
laws
may
impose
some
restriction
on
an
enterprise's
flexibility
to
change
its
internal
business
organization.
but,
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
antitrust
laws
themselves
should
be
interpreted
to
impose
an
additional
inhibition
on
an
enterprise's
ability
to
adopt
various
forms
of
internal
business
organization.
the
view
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
that
it
is
self-contradictory
for
the
antitrust
laws
to
be
interpreted
to
impede
this
particular
avenue
of
achieving
efficiencies,
to
impede
this
particular
way
of
competing.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
paradox
like
section
2
that
ultimately
furthers
the
overall
larger
purposes
of
the
sherman
act,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
self-contradiction
that
detracts
from
the
achievement
of
those
purposes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid
basis
for
distinction
here.
now,
it
is
true
that
intraenterprise
conspiracy
can
be
referred
to
or
relied
on
in
situations
where
fortuitously
there
is
reason
in
furthering
the
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
find
a
violation.
in
our
brief,
we
attempted
to
show
that
many
of
this
court's
decisions
can
be
explained
that
way.
but,
in
any
instance
where
it
is
useful
to
the
objectives
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
do
that,
it
would
be
equally
useful
to
do
it
if
the
same
effect
were
achieved
through
operation
by
divisions
that
had
the
same
external
effects
rather
than
the
fact
that
there
happened
to
be
a
separate
corporation
in
the
internal
organization
of
the
enterprise.
so,
the
reliance
on
the
corporate
form,
seems
to
us,
only
to
obscure
the
proper
antitrust
analysis
and
at
the
same
time
to
deter
flexibility
in
organizing
the
enterprise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
haven't
really
considered
whether
there
would
be
a
violation
of
section
1
if
these
were
independent
organizations.
there
certainly
would
be
a
basis
for
at
least
a
rule
of
reason
argument,
if
not
a
per
se
argument,
that
there
was
a
violation
here
and
there
was
a
finding
of
tortious
interference
with
contract.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
here
is
that
while
an
external
effects
test
seems
to
implicate
antitrust
policies
and
objectives,
it
really
is
a
form
in
the
intraenterprise
conspiracy
context
of
expanding
the
restraints
on
unilateral
behavior,
what
is
essentially
unilateral
behavior,
without
facing
up
to
the
question
whether
section
2
of
the
act
should
be
read
that
expansively
because
the
fact
that
that
is
the
form
of
internal
organization
of
the
defendant
organization
really
is
a
fortuity
from
the
standpoint
of
the
ability
of
that
organization
to
achieve
the
same
economic
result
through
the
same
activity.
now,
it
is
true
that
competition
within
an
enterprise
can
have
beneficial
effects
and
that
is
perhaps
one
of
the
confusing
factors
in
this
field.
but,
the
proper
role
of
the
antitrust
laws
in
our
view
is
to
encourage
those
benefits
only
indirectly
as
matters
of
managerial
discretion.
this
becomes
very
apparent
in
a
very
simple
example
of
the
kind
of
beneficial
effects
that
can
result.
rivalry
between
two
clerks
in
a
department
store
can
result
in
much
better
service
to
the
customers
in
a
particular
situation.
but,
it
is
obvious
to
everyone
that
the
extent
to
which
the
clerks
shall
compete
with
each
other
and
the
extent
to
which
they
will
cooperate
must
be
a
matter
of
managerial
discretion,
that
the
clerks
certainly
cannot
be
cut
off
from
each
other
in
the
kinds
of
exchanges
of
information
that
may
be
inappropriate
between
independent
enterprises
and
that
what
counts
is
that
the
management
of
macy's
is
competing
with
gimball's
across
the
way
and
will
develop
whatever
mix
of
rivalry
and
cooperation
within
the
enterprise
that
best
serves
that
competition.
there
is
really
no
difference
in
principle
in
the
more
complicated
question
of
cooperation
or
competition
between
divisions
of
an
enterprise
like
general
motors
or
cooperation
or
competition
between
separately
incorporated
subsidiaries.
what
we
are
speaking
of
here
does
not,
in
our
view
and
contrary
to
the
submission
made
in
the
briefs
on
the
other
side,
require
the
court
to
adopt
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
which
exemptions
are
not
lightly
implied.
the
question
of
exemption
arises
when
a
statute
other
than
the
antitrust
laws
is
being
construed
to
determine
whether
by
implication
or
otherwise
it
exempts
certain
conduct
from
the
scope
of
those
laws.
this
is
a
question
purely
of
construing
the
sherman
act
itself
and
the
exemption
cases
do
not
apply
here.
then
in
response
to
one
other
question,
we
don't
think
this
can
be
limited
to
the
100
percent
situation
because
some
of
the
most
pro-competitive
aspects
of
separate
incorporation
are
the
ability
to
diversify
the
stock
ownership
to
some
extent.
