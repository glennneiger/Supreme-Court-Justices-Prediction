dean
griswold,
would
you
think
that
would
be
possible
if,
despite
complete
ownership,
there
were
different
officers
and
directors
of
the
two
companies?
unknown
speaker
does
it
matter
if
it
is
anything
over
51
percent
ownership
or
do
you
get
different
questions
if
it
isn't
100
percent?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true,
but,
of
course,
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
future.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
dean
griswold,
suppose...
as
i
understand
it
regal
and
copperweld
really
functioned
in
different
markets
and
produced
different
products.
suppose
that
regal
had
persuaded
copperweld
to
refuse
to
sell
some
important
component
that
it
produced
to
a
potential
competitor
or
subsidiary
of
regal.
just
assume
that.
would
that
be
in
agreement
that
on
your
approach
would
be
protected?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
guess
i
correctly
understand
your
argument
as
being
no
matter
what
the
agreement
may
be,
if
one
is
wholly
owned
by
the
other,
it
can
never
be
a
conspiracy
within
section
1.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
certainly
have
to
consider
that
possibility,
don't
we,
in
deciding
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
far
your
proposition,
if
we
accept
it,
is
to
take
us.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
would
have
to
repudiate
any
holdings,
mr.
griswold?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
would
have
to
repudiate
any
holdings
as
opposed
to
any
language?
unknown
speaker
that
was
justice
clark's
opinion,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
he
cite
yellow
cab?
i
have
forgotten.
my
impression
is
he
didn't.
unknown
speaker
dean
griswold,
do
you
think
parke-davis
can
be
reconciled
with
your
view?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
distinguish
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
has
section
5
as
a
practical
matter
been
used
frequently?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask
one
question?
you
have
emphasized
the
internal
operations
of
affiliated
group
of
companies.
the
attorney
general's
committee
report
in
1955
drew
a
distinction
which
may
or
may
not
be
valid
between
internal
and
external
activities.
what
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
today
on
the
views
of
the
attorney
general's
committee
in
1955?
unknown
speaker
would
you
take
the
view
that
the
activity
shown
by
this
record,
if
performed
by
independent
corporations,
constituted
a
violation
of
section
1?
and,
if
so,
why
is
it
worse
if
they
are
affiliated?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
mr.
grimm,
could
copperweld
have
avoided
all
this
difficulty
had
it
just
made
this
a
division
when
it
acquired
regal?
unknown
speaker
no,
but...
would
it
have
avoided
any
section
1
problems
if
it
had
done
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
reasons
independent
of
antitrust
considerations
perhaps
which
explains
why
they
didn't
do
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
petitioners
had
not
been
separately
incorporated
and
it
had
been
a
division
within
the
corporation,
would
there
have
been
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
really
a
question
so
i
am
not
sure
the
consequences
of
the
action
are
as
significant
as
you
suggest.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
been...
to
pursue
the
other
question
submitted,
would
the
mechanism
have
been
any
different
if
it
was
a
division
of
copperweld?
unknown
speaker
would
the
control
have
been
any
different?
unknown
speaker
with
common
directors
and
common
chairman
of
the
board
and
officers?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
commonly
true
of
division
of
large
organizations,
day-to-day
operations
are
in
the
hands
of
the
division?
unknown
speaker
what
position
do
you
take
if
the
board
of
directors
are
identical
and
the
officers
are
identical?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
do.
unknown
speaker
in
my
hypothetical,
the
officers
are
identical.
unknown
speaker
how
in
the
world...
do
you
want
to
give
them
a
lie
detector
test
or
something?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
you
would
find
that
the
board
of
directors
would
act
differently
when
they
are
sitting
in
the
subsidiary
board
meeting
than
they
were
here?
would
they
be
hostile
by
any
chance?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
in
the
world
they
could
be?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
they
could
be
other
than
100
percent
cooperative?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
that
they
could
do
that
the
independent
person
couldn't
do?
i
think
it
adds
up
that
they
are
not
independent,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grimm,
who
controls
the
profits
of
the
subsidiary
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but,
when
he
made
a
profit,
who
controlled
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
were
consolidated
returns
filed
both
to
the
public
and
the
sec?
unknown
speaker
but,
they
were
filed?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
limitation
on
capital
expenditures
by
the
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
level?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
go
very
far
with
$10,000,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
day-to-day
operations.
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
policy
decisions
with
respect
to
what?
unknown
speaker
corporate
acquisitions
were
not
approved
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
if
it
were
a
division
of
a
central
corporation,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
management
of
the
division
is
supposed
to
move
out
on
its
own
and
look
for
more
business.
unknown
speaker
tell
me,
mr.
grimm,
is
there
any
decision
of
this
court
construing
section
1
as
you
suggest
it
should
be
construed?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
decision
of
this
court
which
says
that
if
they
are
two
independent...
in
the
sense
that
they
are
two
corporate
parties
here
that
any
agreement
between
them
is
a
violation
of
section
1?
unknown
speaker
do
you
read
those
as
holding
that
because
there
are
two
independent
corporations
here
that
is
enough
that
it
falls
within
section
1?
unknown
speaker
apart
from
what
the
agreement
may
be
between
them.
if
there
is
an
agreement
as
defined
under
section
1,
the
fact
that
these
are
two
independent
parties,
are
the
you
suggesting
we
have
held
makes
it
a
violation
of
section
1?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
if
that
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
ordinarily
if
that
is
to
be
changed,
that
is
for
congress
not
for
us
to
do?
unknown
speaker
does
the
two
corporate
language
that
you
referred
to
in
the
statute
do
any
more
than
get
you
past
the
first
threshold
of
a
case?
in
other
words,
if
it
was
the
"x"
division
of
"y"
corporation,
then
you
wouldn't
meet
that
threshold
test,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
language,
two
corporations,
doesn't
really
decide
very
much,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
one
of
the
first
questions
you
asked.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
have
conceded
that
the
parent
corporation
kept
this
subsidiary
on
a
very
tight
short
rein.
unknown
speaker
the
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
