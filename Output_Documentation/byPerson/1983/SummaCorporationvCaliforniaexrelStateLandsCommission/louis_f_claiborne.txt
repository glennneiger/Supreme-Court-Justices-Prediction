mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
could,
of
course,
debate
the
wisdom,
indeed,
even
the
correctness
of
the
rule
exempting
mexican
land
grants
from
the
equal
footing
principle
that
the
state
is
the
owner
of
at
least
navigable
water
bottoms
and
tidal
lands,
but
on
this
question,
the
law
has
been
settled
so
well
so
long
ago
that
to
engage
in
such
an
exercise
today
with
respect
to
a
rule
of
property
would
seem
out
of
bounds
and
out
of
date.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
ought
not
be
permitted
to
attempt
to
circumvent
that
settled,
established
law
by
conceding
the
bare
title
to
these
tidelands
to
the
landowner
while
claiming
to
have
reserved
for
itself
all
the
uses
and
full
control
of
those
water
bottoms.
but
in
our
view,
this
is
uniquely
a
case
ruled
by
authority,
indeed,
by
two
decisions
of
this
court.
those
are,
in
our
view,
the
coronado
beach
case,
reported
in
volume
255
of
this
court's
decision,
and
the
title
insurance
company
case,
reported
ten
volumes
later
at
265
u.s.,
both
cases
cited
in
all
briefs.
those
are
two
unanimous
decisions,
the
first
one
by
mr.
justice
holmes,
the
second
by
mr.
justice
van
de
vanter,
bringing,
as
this
court
has
remarked
in
later
days,
the
authority
of
an
expert
in
the
field
of
land
law
and
indian
law.
those
two
decisions
represent
the
culmination
of
a
long
line
of
cases
stretching
back
more
than
50
years
in
which
the
court
had
addressed
the
several
problems
relating
to
mexican
land
grants.
for
the
most
part,
the
decisions
in
1921
and
1923
merely
reaffirmed
what
was
already
well
settled,
but
they
did
more.
they
put
to
rest
any
doubts,
any
ambiguities,
any
unresolved
questions
that
still
lingered
at
this
date.
as
it
happens
in
both
these
cases,
the
united
states
was
then
advancing,
in
the
early
1920's,
arguments
very
like
those
advanced
by
california
today,
but
we
lost,
and
that
was
more
than
60
years
ago.
even
then,
the
court
chided
the
government
with
attempting
to
unsettle
rules
of
property
on
which
substantial
reliance
had
been
placed
in
the
interim,
and
which
in
the
court's
words
"to
now
disturb
would
be
fraught
with
many
injurious
results.
"
now,
obviously,
that
is
all
the
more
true
now,
60
years
later.
touching
those
cases
briefly,
the
first
one,
the
coronado
beach
company
case,
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
brought
a
condemnation
action
with
respect
to
an
island
in
san
diego
bay
which
was
the
subject...
which
had
been
the
subject
of
a
mexican
grant.
the
question
was
whether
the
grant
of
the
island
embraced
some
600
acres
of
water
bottoms
on
one
side,
both
submerged
and
tidelands.
we
then
in
1921
elaborately
argued
that
the
tidelands
could
not
have
passed
to
the
grantee
because
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
they
had
been
reserved
to
the
state;
furthermore,
that
mexican
law
would
not
have
included
such
water
bottoms;
and
finally,
that
the
land
commission,
which
had
seemingly
adjudicated
the
water
bottoms
as
part
of
the
grant,
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
those
arguments,
as
i
say,
elaborately
put
to
the
court,
were
rejected
in
three
sentences
by
justice
holmes,
and
from
that
day
that
question
has
no
longer
been
thought
open,
but
interestingly,
the
united
states
made
an
alternative
argument
in
that
case,
and
it
was
that
even
if
bare
title
had
passed
to
the
mexican
grantee,
the
united
states
did
not...
was
not
required
to
pay
full
value
for
these
water
bottoms
in
this
condemnation
action
because
there
were
reserved
public
rights
both
in
the
united
states
and
in
the
state
of
california
that
so
diminished
the
value
of
these
water
bottoms
that
the
very
inflated
price
ought
not
be
paid.
we
claimed,
among
other
things,
the
california
public
trust,
citing
the
california
fish
case
as
an
indication
that
the
grantee
had
never
received
these
rights.
now,
once
again,
the
court
rejected
these
arguments
firmly
and
affirmed
the
award.
that
ought
to
have
been
the
end
of
the
proposition
that
any
such
pervasive
easement
attached
to
mexican
grants
in
the
absence
of
any
words
to
that
effect,
and
incidentally,
in
that
case,
the
words
about
enclosing
without
prejudice
to
crossings,
roads,
and
servitudes
were
included
in
the
grant
and
were
pleaded
by
the
united
states
just
as
they
are
in
this
grant
pleaded
by
california.
but
the
court
has
put
those
aside.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
court
adverts,
mr.
justice
stevens,
only
to
one
of
the
claims,
which
was
a
claim
of
a
right
in
the
government
to
use
the
property
for
national
defense,
and
the
court
firmly
rejects
that
there
was
any
such
easement
or
servitude
attaching
to
these
water
bottoms,
and
that
therefore
any
diminishment
of
value
resulting
from
that
cause
ought
not
be
taken
into
account.
the
court
does
not
directly
address
the
other
kinds
of
public
trust
claimed
by
the
united
states,
but
apparently
rejects
them,
and
since
the
whole
burden
of
the
argument
by
the
united
states
was
that
that
aspect
had
been
overvalued,
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
valuation
had
said
the
owner
may
use
his
lands
as
he
sees
fit
only
subject
to
harborlines,
and
indeed
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing,
pointing
again
to
this
overvaluation
question
and
the
diminishment
in
value
due
to
the
trust.
it
is
hard
to
see
that
the
court
didn't
reject
that
argument
out
of
hand.
the
other
case
to
which
i
would
call
the
court'
attention
is
the
insurance
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
sued
on
behalf
of
mission
indians
seeking
the
quiet
title,
their
indian
possessory
title
only
to
occupy
the
land
which
had
been
the
subject
of
a
mexican
grant,
claiming
that
this
kind
of
less
than
fee
title
was
not
a
proper
subject
for
adjudication
by
the
land
commission
and
that
the
indians
would
not
have
been
required
to
put
it
forward
in
the
1850's.
the
court,
adhering
to
an
earlier
decision,
said
not
so.
the
indians
should
have
put
forth
their
claim
or
the
government
should
have
put
it
forth
on
their
behalf.
that
was
now
done.
it
is
now
far
too
late,
and
the
indian
claim
must
fail.
it
seems
to
us
that
once
again
this
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
claim
of
less
than
full
fee
title
is
one
which
if
not
preserved
in
these
confirmation
proceedings
is
indeed
lost
to
the
claimant,
and
that
claimant
is
anyone
who
claims
derivatively
from
the
united
states,
here
the
state
of
california.
the
combined
effect
of
these
two
decisions
is
to
reject
any
notion
that
the
reservation
of
usages
or
servitudes
in
the
standard
boilerplate
can
be
read
as
preserving
the
kinds
of
public
rights--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
wouldn't
say
on
a
higher
footing,
justice
rehnquist,
but
this
court
has
more
readily
found
that
mexican
grants
include
tidelands
or
submerged
lands
than
it
has
with
respect
to
original
grants
by
the
united
states
in
which
there
was
a
like
ambiguity.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
and
borax
is
only
one
of
the
most
recent
decisions
in
which
the
court
reaffirmed
once
again
what
was
done
most
recently
of
all
in
the
case
in
oregon,
corvalis,
that
one
exception
to
the
rule
that
water
bottoms
inure
to
the
state
is
where
in
pursuance
of
international
obligations,
referring
to
the
mexican
treaty,
those
water
bottoms
had
been
previously
alienated
to
a
private
grantee.
