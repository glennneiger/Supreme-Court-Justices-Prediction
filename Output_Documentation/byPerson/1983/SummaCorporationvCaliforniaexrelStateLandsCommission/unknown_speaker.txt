unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
is
that
a
holding
or
a
statement
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
you
are
quoting
from
or
one
of
the
california
appellate
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
may
i
interrupt
you
and
ask
you
one
question?
i
understand
that
you
don't
in
your
brief
argue
the
point
that
the
government
does
in
the
first
point
of
their
brief
about
what
happened
with
the
actual
original
conveyance.
if
you
assume
that
the
trust
was
reserved
in
the
original
conveyance,
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
what
is
your
view
as
to
the
status
of
the
title
to
the
trust
interest
the
day
after
california
was
admitted
to
the
union
and
before
the
1851
act
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that
answers
my
question,
mr.
christopher.
i
am
assuming
that
before
it
was
answered,
that
the
correct
answer
would
have
been
that
it
was
something
other
than
what
happened
in
1851.
you
are
saying
that
the
activity
pursuant
to
the
1851
statute
conveyed
that
interest
regardless
of
what
its
status
was
before,
as
i
understand
it.
you
say
that
even
though
that
would
have
enlarged
the
rights
of
your
clients.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
i
am
interested
in
just
how
this
is
a
federal
question.
supposing
this
happened,
that
your
client
had
a
confirmed
patent
from
the
mexican
land
grant
that
had
been
authorized
by
the
claims
commission,
and
so
forth,
and
adjoining
your
client's
property
was
another
property
which
didn't
come
under
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo,
and
there
was
just
a
classic
surveying
dispute,
say,
as
to
20
feet
of
their
property.
the
mexican
patent
showed
that
your
client
owned
it.
the
deed
under
the
authority
of
the
state
of
california
showed
that
the
other
people
owned
it.
and
that
is
litigated
in
the
california
courts,
and
the
california
supreme
court
applies
its
rule
as
to
how
you
solve
these
surveying
ambiguity
disputes,
and
rules
against
your
client,
saying
that
the
mexican
patent
description
doesn't
prevail.
do
you
think
your
client
could
come
here
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
a
federal
question
because
the
full
latitude
of
the
description
in
the
confirmed
mexican
patent
wasn't
confirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california?
unknown
speaker
can
this
case
be
decided
without
passing
on
the
treaty
problems
that
you
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
don't
we
have
to
decide
the
treaty
questions
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
that
very
question,
isn't
that
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
let
me
follow
through
a
little
on
justice
rehnquist's
inquiry.
if
you
prevail
here,
are
we
not
constructing,
what
shall
i
call
it,
a
mason-dixon
line
between...
in
the
southern
part
of
california
with
these
old
mexican
grants,
and
in
the
northern
part
where
there
are
no
mexican
grants,
with
different
rules
of
law
flowing
from
each?
unknown
speaker
mr.
christopher,
does
the
california
public
trust
doctrine
embrace
any
land
other
than
tidal
land?
unknown
speaker
so
we
are
not
simply
addressing
in
this
case
tidal
lands
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
a
decision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
is
it
possible
that
that
holding
could
rest
on
the
notion
that
the
trust
did
not
in
fact
change
the
value
of
the
lands
as
opposed
to
a
holding
that
there
was
no
such
trust
interest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
is
it
your
position,
and
i
take
it
you
say
it
is
supported
by
the
cases
if
it
is,
that
land
grants
coming
under
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo
based
on
old
mexican
grants
prior
to
the
accession
of...
the
mexican
cession
stand
on
a
different
and
higher
footing
in
the
world
of
land
transactions
than,
say,
a
grant
from
the
united
states,
simply
a
patent
from
the
united
states
made
by
the
general
land
office.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
borax
case
in
296
u.s.,
the
court
distinguishes
knight
and
some
of
those
other
cases,
saying
those
involved
mexican
land
grants,
and
we
are
kind
of
going
to
apply
a
different
rule
where
mexican
land
grants
aren't
involved.
unknown
speaker
ms.
saggese?
unknown
speaker
do
you
concede
that
there
is
a
federal
question
presented
here?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
interrupt?
on
the
1851
act,
if
we
take
your
adversary's
position,
i
understand
them
to
be
arguing
that
that
may
have
enlarged
the
title
of
the
mexican
grantees,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
federal
question
as
to
whether
the
federal
patent
could
convey
more
than
the
mexican
government
had
previously
conveyed.
wouldn't
that
be
a
federal
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
argument.
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
it
did
grant
more.
even
if
the
mexican
grant
did
not
include
the
trust
reservation,
as
i
understand
their
position,
although
the
government
is
a
little
ambiguous
in
its
brief,
they
in
effect
argue
that
there
was
an
enlargement
of
the
grant.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
whether
it
is
correct
or
incorrect
is
a
federal
question,
is
all
i
am
addressing
my
remark
to.
unknown
speaker
what
treaty,
ms.
sagesse,
did
the
new
orleans
case
grow
out
of?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
expressed
counterpart
to
the
provision
in
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo
in
the
louisiana
purchase
treaty?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
right
there,
then
we
are
not
talking
about
just
a
federal
right
that
arises
under
any
patent
confirming
a
prior
mexican
grant
in
the
whole
mexican
cession
area,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
area
between
the
mississippi
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
the
canadian
border.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
it
isn't
entirely
impossible
under
your
theory
that
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
which
is
a
state
that
was
acquired
in
the
louisiana
purchase,
could
next
year
decide
that
under
old
french
law
the
state
owned
the
bottom
of
all
the
riverbeds,
even
though
that
had
never
been
the
law
in
nebraska
up
to
now,
and
presumably
that
would
then
depend
on
an
examination
of
the
old
french
authorities
prior
to
the
louisiana
purchase.
unknown
speaker
ms.
sagesse,
why
isn't
the
california
court
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
question
of
historical
fact
in
the
1851
act
proceedings
that
the
lands
weren't
tidelands?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
they
were
tidelands
or
not?
unknown
speaker
ms.
sagesse,
some
time
during
your
argument
would
you
mind
taking
out
the
map
that
appears
at
the
back
of
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
and
identifying
which
of
the
lands
there
are
the
subject
of
this
particular
dispute?
unknown
speaker
the
very
bottom
of
the
map?
unknown
speaker
where
it
says
del
ray
lagoon?
unknown
speaker
north
of
the
entrance
channel.
unknown
speaker
part
of
the...
the
southern
part
of
the
ballona
lagoon?
is
that
what
we
are--
unknown
speaker
--no,
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out.
thank
you
very
much.
unknown
speaker
one
point
that
is
made
by
your
opponents,
and
they
dispute
the
supreme
court
of
california
on
this,
i
guess,
is,
they
say
that
we
are
not
really
talking
here
about
an
incident
of
sovereignty.
we
are
talking
about
essentially
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
land,
because
presumably
it
is
so
extensive
in
their
view.
do
you
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
so-called
sovereign
power
that
you
say
it
is
and
the
ordinary
property
interest
is
a
rather
clear
one?
unknown
speaker
under
your
theory,
is
it
essential
that
this
public
trust
doctrine
or
its
counterpart
had
existed
under
mexican
law
at
the
time
of
the
1839
grant?
unknown
speaker
in
view
of
the
coronado
beach
and
some
of
the
others
kind
of
attaching
special
significance
to
mexican
land
grants,
i
would
think
if
this
hadn't
existed
under
mexican
law
you
would
have
a
real
problem.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
could
i
ask,
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
about
the
existence
of
the
easement
in
the
original
mexican
grant?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
language?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
don't
dispute,
as
i
understand
you,
that
title
to
the
tidelands
itself
is
in
your
opponent.
it
is
just
the
trust
interest
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
is
a
little
different.
in
the
coronado
beach
case
there
was
actually
a
dispute
over
the
ownership
of
the
tidelands
themselves.
unknown
speaker
yes.
could
i
ask
you,
i
take
it
that
under
the
california
public
trust
doctrine,
the
state
could
actually
take
possession
of
the
property
and
develop
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
take
possession
and
develop
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
was
true
of
the
reserved
right
which
you
claimed
existed
in
favor
of
the
sovereign
in
mexico
and
under
mexican
law?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
improvements
on
this
lagoon
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed?
unknown
speaker
none
today?
unknown
speaker
would
the
owner
of
the
fee
have
had
the
right,
say,
to
put
a
large
marina
on
it?
unknown
speaker
could
the
city
of
los
angeles
have
enjoined
an
improvement
that
it
thought
interfered,
perhaps,
with
its
wetland
rights?
unknown
speaker
before
any
development
could
be
made,
permission
has
to
be
obtained?
unknown
speaker
i
am
puzzled
about
that.
is
this
public
trust
interest
something
that
the
state
can
or
cannot
convey
to
a
private
owner?
unknown
speaker
can
they
surrender
entirely?
unknown
speaker
you
rely
on
the
illinois
central
case,
which
i
understood
held
that
if
it
is
this
kind
of
animal,
this
kind
of
trust
right,
the
state
legislature
does
not
have
the
power
to
divest
the
state
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
could
the
state
of
california
divest
its
entire
ownership
in
this
particular...
what
is
in
dispute
here.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
meanwhile,
the
fee
title,
without
the
permission
of
the
lands
commission,
you
can't
do
anything--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
can
he
make
that
use...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
any
use
he
wants
to
make
of
it,
the
consistency
with
the
state
interest
has
to
be
determined,
and
that
is
by
the
lands
commission.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
doesn't
he
have
to
get
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
it
would
automatically
happen
how?
he
would
have
to
go
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--my
question
is,
he
can't
do
anything
without
that
permission,
can
he?
you
say
he
wouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
anything?
i
mean,
he
could
build
on
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
can
he
do
without
getting
a
permit,
with
the
mexican
lands?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
still
don't
understand.
what
may
he
do
without
getting
a
lands
commission
permit?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
it
may
be.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn't
develop
it
without
it.
what
may
he
do
without
going
to
the
lands
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean?
he
can
fish?
he
can
hunt?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can't
produce
too
much
income
for
the
fee
title
owner,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
follow
up,
please,
ma'am?
we
have
an
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
title
examiners
association
of
california,
the
title
insurance
companies,
i
guess
it
is.
unknown
speaker
they
say
that
thousands
of
policies
have
been
issued
that
have
not
recognized
california
law
to
be
as
your
brief
describes
it.
is
this
just
attributable
to
the
ignorance
of
the
lawyers
who
examine
the
titles?
or
what
is
the
explanation
of
that?
unknown
speaker
related
to
that
question,
has
the
state
of
california
asserted
before
this
case
in
other
cases
involving
mexican
rancho
grants
this
public
trust?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
a
recent
position
taken
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
get
the
permission
in
the
first
place,
that
determination
is
made
by
the
commission,
is
it?
