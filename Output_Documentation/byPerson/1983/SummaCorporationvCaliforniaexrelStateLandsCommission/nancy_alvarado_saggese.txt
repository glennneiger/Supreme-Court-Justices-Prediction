ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
comes
before
this
court
seeking
equality
of
title
that
is
higher
than
mexico
granted
to
his
predecessors
in
interest,
and
more
than
the
united
states
confirmed
in
carrying
out
its
obligations
under
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo,
but
in
order
to
obtain
this
result,
petitioner
is
going
to
have
to
convince
this
court
to
give
it
special
treatment,
because
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
respect
to
the
confirmation
proceedings
and
sovereign
rights
and
tidelands
are
all
the
other
way.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
your
honor,
there
are
four
possible
bases
for
a
federal
question,
as
summa
has
stated
in
its
brief.
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo
is
a
possible
basis.
however,
we
do
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
treaty
and
we
don't
think
that
it
requires
an
interpretation
of
the
treaty
in
order
to
determine
this
case.
furthermore,
the
treaty
did
say
that
the
united
states
was
to
inviolably
respect
prior
existing
titles,
but
it
did
not
state
what
those
titles
were,
so
we
think
the
treaty
is
not
involved
here,
the
interpretation
of
it,
that
is.
the
act
of
1851
is
another
possible
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction,
but
again,
we
do
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
act,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
needs
to
be
interpreted.
the
act
simply
set
forth
a
procedure
for
confirming
preexisting
titles,
but
it
did
not
create
new
federal
titles.
the
same
with
the
patent,
the
third
possible
basis.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
your
honor,
you
would
not
be
interpreting...
since
the
patent
did
not
create
a
new
federal
title--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--yes,
but
this
court
has
held
in
no
less
than
seven
cases
that
patents
issued
in
confirmation
of
preexisting
mexican
titles
did
not
create
a
new
federal
title,
so
we
think
that
that
argument
is
incorrect.
this
court
has--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
your
honor,
once
again,
we
would
point
to
those
cases
that
say
that
when
a
confirmatory
patent
is
at
issue,
in
order
to
determine
what
the
mexican
grantees
got,
that
is,
whether
what
they
got
confirmed
was
what
mexico
had
granted
them
or
whether
it
enlarged...
the
united
states
could
have
enlarged
those
rights
as
it
could
have.
the
united
states
was
free
to
grant
any
of
its
proprietary
rights
to
mexican
grantees
and
thereby
enlarge
those
rights,
but
we
would
say
that
again
it
is
a
local
question
to
determine
exactly
what
was
granted
by
mexico
and
then
what
the
grantee
ended
up
with
as
a
result
of
the
confirmatory
grant.
the
only
other
possible
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
is
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
and
while
that
does
have
its
basis
in
the
constitution,
we
believe
that
that
question
has
already
been
answered
by
this
court.
the
lewis
bluepoint
oyster
company
versus
briggs
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
affirmed
the
state
decision
below
interpreting
a
pre-revolutionary
war
crown
grant.
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
a
grant
by
the
crown
of
tide
and
submerged
lands
passed
only
the
crown's
proprietary
rights
or
use
provatim
in
the
lands
subject
to
the
public
rights
in
the
lands
or
use
publicum,
and
that
after
the
revolution,
the
state
succeeded
to
the
remaining
public
rights
the
use
publicum
or
public
trust,
just
as
it
succeeded
to
the
full
ownership
of
tide
and
submerged
lands
that
had
not
previously
been
granted,
and
that
is
all
that
the
state
seeks
here.
we
think
that
that
question
has
already
been
answered,
and
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
rights
in
tidelands
that
are
less
than
full
ownership
did
pass
to
the
state.
of
course,
that
is
a
federal
question,
but
once
again,
we
think
it
has
been
answered.
almost
150
years
ago,
in
fact,
in
new
orleans
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
held
that
public
rights
arising
under
a
prior
sovereign
would
be
recognized
and
respected
even
if
they
had
been
expressly
rejected
in
confirmation
proceedings,
because
public
rights,
in
contrast
to
private
rights,
could
not
be
so
extinguished.
rather,
they
survived,
and
on
statehood,
these
rights
held
by
the
prior
sovereign
passed
to
the
state
to
be
administered
to
the
people.
we
think
that
this
case
presents
an
even
stronger
case
for
affirmation
of
public
rights.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
the
new
orleans
case
came
out
of
the
louisiana
purchase
after
that
property
became
property
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
had
the
same
obligation
to
respect
preexisting
titles
under
international
law.
that
is
a
requirement
even
if
it
is
not
specifically
set
forth
in
any
treaty.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
i
am
not
aware,
but
i
would
think
that
under
international
law
the
united
states
would
have
the
obligation
to
respect
preexisting
titles,
and
it
did
set
up
a
board
of
land
commissioners
identical
to
the
board
of
land
commissioners
in
california
in
purpose--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
the
united
states
has
acquired
a
lot
of
property
from
other
sovereigns,
especially
from
spain,
mexico,
and
france.
however,
those
states
have
already
told
us
what
they
think
of
that...
the
law
of
the
prior
sovereign.
for
example,
in
louisiana
we
do
have
new
orleans
versus
united
states,
where
preexisting
public
rights
were
recognized.
in
florida
we
have
the
apola
jaccla
case,
in
which
the
la
cieta
partidas,
which
was
the
law
in
effect
in
mexico
at
the
time
of
this
grant,
was
interpreted
to
hold
that
a
grant
of
tidelands
passed
again,
the
proprietary
rights
only
held
by
the
crown,
but
retained
the
public
rights,
which
would
remain.
the
public
rights
there
seemed
to--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
your
honor,
if
california
is
correct
in
this
case,
nebraska
would
have
to
follow
the
same
type
of
analysis
as
california
has
proposed
here,
and
it
would
have
to
be
a
right
that
was
existing
under
the
previous
sovereign,
and
the
analysis
would
also
have
to
consider
whether
that
right
would
take
away
any
rights
for
existing
private
property
rights
under
the
preexisting
sovereign,
and
also
determine
whether
or
not
that
right
is
consistent
with
and
compatible
with
its
own
system
of
laws.
for
example,
in
california,
the
courts
have
looked
at
water
rights
questions,
and
have
decided
to
adopt
federal
water
rights,
because
they
are
consistent
and
compatible
with
their
own
system,
but
rejected
the
appropriative
water
rights
system
that
mexico
held
in
favor
of
a
riparian
one.
so
these
questions
have
been
decided
all
along
since
statehood
in
the
various
states,
and
this
is
the
type
of
analysis
that
has
been
used.
tidelands
are
a
special
type
cf
property.
it
is
a
type
of
property
that
has
been...
in
which
public
use
and
public
rights
have
been
protected
by
nations
since
the
time
of
justinian.
it
is
a
type
of
property
that
is
so
important
to
the
state
functioning
as
a
state
that
it
has
been
identified
with
the
police
power
as
an
incident
of
sovereignty.
the
tideland--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
your
honor,
those
proceedings
took
place
pursuant
to
the
act
of
1851,
and
the
board
and
the
general
land
office
had
a
very
limited
jurisdiction
under
that
act.
it
had
to
determine
the
validity
of
title
and
then
if
found
to
be
valid
to
locate
them
on
the
ground.
this
court
held
in
freemont
versus
united
states
that
those
bodies...
expressly
held
that
those
bodies
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
or
affect
sovereign
rights.
so
the
first
answer
to
that
question
is
that
any
determination
made
in
the
general
land
office
as
to
the
location
of
a
private
grant
could
not
have
affected
sovereign
rights
because
it
didn't
have
the
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
but
secondly--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
i
think
that
was
an
irrelevant
question
in
that
proceeding
because
the
purpose
of
the
proceedings
in
the
general
land
office
was
not
to
determine
the
character
of
property
and
then
if
found
to
be
tidal
to
exclude
them,
but
rather
to
determine
if
the
surveys
that
had
been
made
of
the
ranchos
had
accurately
depicted
the
boundaries
set
forth
in
the
decree
of
confirmation.
the
fact
of
the
character
of
the
land
that
would
be
encompassed
within
a
rancho
was
really
irrelevant
to
the
general
land
office.
for
example,
many
years
before
the
la
ballona
survey
was
approved
by
the
general
land
office,
it
had
approved
the
survey
for
the
rancho
that
was
involved
in
the
coronado
beach
case.
now,
that
admittedly
contained
within
it
tide
and
submerged
lands
in
san
diego
bay,
and
yet
the
general
land
office
approved
it,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
contained
tide
and
submerged
lands,
because
it
found
that
the
survey
accurately
depicted
the
boundaries
that
had
been
set
in
the
decree
of
confirmation,
and
that
is
all
they
did
in
this
case.
it
is
true
that
a
statement
was
made
by
commissioner
drummond
that
the
inner
bay
is
not
an
arm
of
the
sea.
however,
for
one
thing,
it
was
a
not
irrelevant
determination
to
what
they
were
doing,
and
secondly,
it
was
superseded
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior's
decision
on
the
case
which
didn't
mention
the
character
of
the
land
at
all,
and
simply
said
that
the
survey's
northeastern
and
northwestern
boundaries
had
been
correctly
located,
and
furthermore,
the
subject
of
the
instant
case
is
not
in
that
inner
bay.
it
is
a
part
of
the
inlet
which
in
the
u.s.
coast
survey
map
of
1876
is
shown
as
tideland,
which
even
the
solicitor
general
concedes
shows
a
low
water
line,
indicating
that
it
is
tidal.
for
that
reason,
it
has
never
been
determined
otherwise
than
to
be
tidal,
and
that
was
what
the
experts
at
trial
looked
to,
not
the
character
of
the
entire
inner
bay
as
to
whether
it
was
tidelands
historically,
but
only
that
part
of
the
inlet
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
was
found
to
be
tidelands
today
and
tidelands
for
the
last
900
years.
the
tidelands
in
issue
here,
i
should
point
out,
are
very
small
in
size.
they
take
up
about
12
acres
of
the
approximately
14,000
acres
confirmed
to
summa's
predecessors
in
interest,
but
they
are
important
nevertheless
to
the
state
because
they
are
one
of
the
few
remaining
undeveloped
estuaries
in
southern
california.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
be
happy
to
do
that.
that
map
and
petitioner's
statement
and
also
that
of
the
solicitor
general
would
have
this
court
believe
that
an
entire
area
of
the
inner
bay
is
involved
in
the
instant
proceedings,
but
it
is
actually,
as
i
say,
12
acres
of
tidelands
that
are
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
map.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes,
where
it
connects
to
the
sea.
today--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--it
is
north
of
the
entrance
channel.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
i
think
you
can
see
a
little
bit
of
the
blue
waterway
with
ballona
lagoon.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes.
well,
that
map
does
not
show
the
historic
lagoon.
it
shows
the
marina
del
ray
small
craft
harbor
that
was
built
in
the
1960's,
and
that,
of
course,
is
not
in
issue
here.
the
only
thing
we
have
is
historic
tidelands.
your
honor,
would
you
like
me
to--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--our
position
is
that
when
these
tidelands
were
held
by
mexico,
they
were
subject
to
public
rights
that
are
very
similar
to
the
public
trust.
in
fact,
in
the
apola
jacola
case,
we
know
that
those
public
rights
had
the
same
source,
that
is,
roman
law
book,
the
common
law
public
trust,
and
the
mexican
public
trust.
they
were
both
recognized
as
incidents
of
sovereignty.
they
were
both...
they
came
into
being
as
a
recognition
of
the
public
interest
in
waterways
and
the
necessity
to
protect
this
public
interest.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes,
your
honor,
the
sovereign
rights
have
always
been
treated
much
differently
from
proprietary
rights.
in
fact,
the
sovereign
ownership
of
land
has
been
very
clearly
shown
to
be
comprised
of
two
separate
elements,
the
proprietary
rights
in
the
land
or
the
use
probating
and
the
public
rights
in
the
land
or
use
publicum,
and
the
sovereign
can
convey
the
proprietary
rights
so
long
as
the
public
rights
are
retained,
and
that
was
what
was
done
in
this
case
by
the
mexican
sovereign.
we
do
have
sovereign
ownership
here.
california
never
owned
the
fee
title
to
the
land,
but
the
mexican
sovereign
did,
and
when
he
granted
out
this
land,
the
public
rights
in
it
remained.
it
is
only
the
public
interest
that
the
state
is
interested
in
here,
and
not
the
proprietary
rights
to
the
land,
and
this
public
interest
is,
it
is
consistent
with
the
state's
interest
in
protecting
these
properties,
because
the
public
trust
or
state's
interest
in
tidelands
is
not
coextensive
with
the
full
breadth
of
ownership.
ownership
of
the
public
trust
interest
has
been
found
to
be
necessary
to
protect
these
properties
and
will
satisfy--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
your
honor,
yes.
it
would
be
a
very
tough
case.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
so.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
coronado
case
for
just
a
moment.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
in
the
original
mexican
grant
we
have
the
language
that
the
grantee
can
enclose
the
property
without
prejudice
to
the
traversing
roads
and
servitudes.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
that
is
the
language,
your
honor,
which
petitioner's
own
expert
witness
on
mexican
law
interpreted
at
trial
to
mean
a
reservation
in
favor
of
the
public,
that
it
would
include
the
public's
rights
in
tidelands,
and
california
courts
have
also
interpreted
this
language,
servitude
in
the
context
of
a
mexican
ranch
grant,
to
be
a
reservation
in
favor
of
the
public,
and
this
court's
holding
in
barker
versus
harvey
is
not
to
the
contrary,
because
in
that
case
this
court
only
found
that
an
indian
private
right
of
occupancy
was
not
a
servitude,
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
california
courts'
determination
that
only
public
rights
were
servitudes
under
mexican
law.
the
indian
right,
being
a
private
right,
could
not
have
been
a
servitude.
in
the
coronado
beach
company
case,
the
solicitor
general
has
talked
to
this
court
at
length
about
what
was
contained
in
the
briefs
for
the
united
states.
i
didn't
have
access
to
them.
i
don't
know
what
was
on
review
to
the
court
by
the
united
states
other
than
what
is
contained
in
the
official
reports.
there
is
an
excerpt
of
the
united
states'
argument
there
in
which
the
united
states
clearly
acknowledges
the
existence
of
the
public
trust.
in
fact,
the
attorney
for
the
coronado
beach
company
also
says
the
public
rights
for
navigation
and
fishery
are
not
in
issue
here.
so
this
was
strictly
a
case
of
whether
the
united
states
was
going
to
have
to
pay
for
this
land.
it
argued,
number
one,
that
it
shouldn't
have
to
because
under
mexican
law
there
was
a
servitude...
this
language,
without
prejudice
to
the
servitudes
existed
in
that
grant
as
well...
and
that
the
servitude
for
military
occupation
would
allow
it
to
be
able
to
get
this
land
free
of
payment
of
compensation.
but
this
court
looked
at
servitude
in
that
grant
and
determined
that
there
was
no
such
servitude
under
mexican
law,
that
the
military
right
of
occupancy
could
not
exist
under
mexican
law
on
private
property,
and
where
it
could
exist,
the
mexican
government
would
have
to
pay
compensation,
so
therefore
there
was
no
servitude
under
mexican
law
that
would
get
the
united
states
out
from
having
to
pay
compensation.
the
only
other
question
that
the
court
addressed
in
its
opinion
is
whether
fee
title
to
tide
and
submerged
lands
would
have
passed
in
the
confirmatory
patent
in
that
case,
and
it
said,
it
acknowledged
that
tidelands
are
usually
held
by
the
state,
but
said
that
since
we
had
the
obligation
to
recognized
preexisting
titles,
and
since
mexico
had
the
ability
to
convey
these
lands,
that
if
they
were
encompassed
within
a
confirmatory
patent,
the
only
thing
we
could
do
was
recognize
them.
the
state's
title
was
held
in
abeyance
until
they
were
finally
located,
and
if
it
was
found
to
include
tide
and
submerged
lands,
that
title
related
back
to
the
original
grant,
which
said
the
state
never
had
any
interest
in
it
as
far
as
the
fee
is
concerned,
but
we
say
that
since
the
sovereign
retained
the
public
rights,
those
public
rights
then
came
to
california
on
its
admission
to
the
union.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
that
is
exactly
correct.
exactly.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
in
fact,
your
honor,
i
think
that
was
the
only
issue
that
the
court
addressed
in
its
opinion,
ownership
of
the
fee
title
of
tidelands.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
the
state
would
have
the
right.
this
retained
public
trust
interest
could
be
exercised.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
that's
right.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
we
do
know
that
it
was
very...
they
were
both
couched
in
the
same
terms.
that
is,
public
rights
for
navigation
and
fishing,
and
in
fact
the
mexican
public
trust
might
have
even
been
broader
because,
as
was
stated
in
the
apola
jacola
case,
it
recognized
public
rights
for
recreation
as
well,
which
the
california
courts
have
only
recently
recognized.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that
you
have
to
compare
the
mexican
public
trust
and
the
common
law
state
public
trust
at
the
time
of
1848
when
the
mexican
sovereign
would
have
relinquished
it,
and
1850,
when
the
state
would
have
succeeded
to
it,
and
it
is
only
at
that
time
that
a
comparison
is
valid.
after
that,
mexican
law
is
irrelevant,
and
the
interests
would
be
defined
by
the
california
common
law.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
never,
your
honor.
there
still
are
none
today.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
none
today.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
your
honor,
as
far
as
privately
owned
tidelands
subject
to
the
public
trust,
there
are
approximately
80,000
acres
of
such
lands
in
private
ownership
in
the
state
today.
these
are
lands
located
outside
of
mexican
ranchos
which
everyone
concedes
the
state
came
into
full
ownership
of
on
its
admission
to
the
union.
so
over
the
years
the
state
has
sold
approximately
80,000
acres
into
private
ownership,
and
yes,
the
uses
that
can
be
made
of
them
include
marinas,
commercial
uses
such
as
restaurants,
commercial
buildings,
hotels.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
the
only
way
that...
once
a
development
is
in...
right
now
there
is
a
procedure
in
california
where
if
a
person
wants
to
make
a
development
on
lands
within
the
coastal
zone,
which
would
include
these
lands,
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
coastal
commission
for
a
development
permit,
the
coastal
commission
then
informs
the
state
lands
commission
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
development
or
one
is
proposed.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
by
the
state
lands
commission.
the
state
lands
commission
will
comment
as
to
whether
the
development
is
or
is
not
consistent
with
the
public
trust,
and
once...
once
a
development
is
in
on
the
basis
that
the
state
lands
commission
had
said
it
is
not
inconsistent,
if
the
state
at
a
later
date
wanted
to
exercise
the
public
trust
to
remove
it,
it
would
have
to
pay
compensation
for
the
improvement
under
state
law
and
for
the
fill.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
the
proprietary
rights
in
tidelands
can
be
conveyed
by
the
state
as
sovereign,
but
subject--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--absolutely
not.
it
is
subject
to
the
public
trust.
it
can
be
surrendered
entirely,
but
only
under
special
circumstances
for
the
reclamation
of
property
in
aid
of
navigation,
similar
to
the
jover
case,
jover
versus
insular
government,
which
was
a
recognition
that
under
the
mexican
law
similar
grants
of
tidelands
could
be
made
for
reclamation
and
improvement
to
navigation,
so
the
two
public
trusts
are
similar--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--that
was
a
case
where
it
was
divesting
its
entire
ownership.
i
think
the
court--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--fee
title
and
public
trust,
no.
it
would
have
to
be...
there
is
state
law
on
this
subject.
it
says
it
has
to
be
a
relatively
small
parcel,
that
it
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
use
of
the
remaining
tidelands,
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
course
of
a
highly
beneficial
program
that
would
aid
navigation,
and
there
might
be
one
other.
there
are
quite
a
few
tests
that
have
to
be
made
before
the
public
trust
would
be
terminated.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
the
private
owner
of
tidelands
can
make
any
use
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
trust.
the
only
thing
that--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--well,
he
can...
if
a
developer
wants
a
determination
from
the
state
lands
commission,
he
can
have
it,
and--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--i
think
that
under
the
procedure
that
is
set,
it
would
automatically
happen
in
the
course
of
getting--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--that
he
would
get
permission
because
it
would
be
part
of
the
development
permit
process.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
unless
he
didn't
want
a
development
permit.
if
he
didn't
go
through
the
development
permit
process,
the
state
lands
commission
would
never
know
about
it,
and
anything
could
go
it
on
that
property
without
knowledge.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
not
without
a
development
permit.
i
would
say
that
in
the
procedure
that
is
set
by
state
law
now
for
development
permits,
the
state
lands
commission
would
be
informed
and
would
comment
on
the
development.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
your
honor,
this
land
is
treated
the
same
as
any
other
tidelands
in
the
state.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
if
he
wants
to
develop...
it
is
not
a
permit,
your
honor.
it
is
just
a
statement
that
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
public
trust.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
i
think
that
in
order
to
put
any
kind
of
a
development
on
it,
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
governmental
permit
process
or
else
he
couldn't
develop
it
at
all,
and
in
going
through
the
governmental
development--
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
--he
can
make
any
use
of
it
in
its
natural
condition
that
it
is
in
now...
it
has
been
in
this
natural
condition
since,
i
suppose,
the
beginning
of
time.
it
is
still
in
its
national
condition
now.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
the
public
has
been
making
that
kind
of
use
of
it,
the
fishing
and
hunting
and
clamming
and
boating
and
swimming,
since
the
1800's
that
we
know
of,
documented
in
the
record,
and
this
use
has
been
going
on,
and
it
still
goes
on
now.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
no,
your
honor.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
there
is
usually
an
exception
in
land
title
policies
for
sovereign
rights
of
the
state,
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
they
state
that
eight
and
a
half
million
acres
of
property
would
be
clouded.
well,
that
must
be
all
property
that
was
ever
included
in
the
mexican
rancho
grant,
and
even
the
california
land
title
association
admits
that
shores
and
tidelands
and
submerged
lands
and
bays
were
not
generally
granted
by
mexico.
we
have
not
done
an
inventory
of
how
much
land
would
be
involved,
but
we
know
that
it
was
not
very
much
land
at
all.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
reply
brief
filed
by
summa,
they
point
to
the
rancho
bolsa
chica
case
and
said
that
the
state
has
changed
its
position,
because
in
that
case
we
took
the
position
that
tidelands
within
ranchos
are
not
subject
to
the
public
trust.
however,
petitioner
has
also
included
in
his
reply
brief
the
supplemental
brief
that
the
state
filed
in
that
case
which
sets
forth
the
responses.
in
that
case,
the
underlying
transaction
involved
was
a
settlement
of
where
sovereign
rights
were
going
to
be,
and
it
was
a
settlement,
and
in
the
underlying
settlement
the
state
did
recognize
that
tidelands
within
ranchos
were
subject
to
the
public
trust.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
well,
it
has
only
come
up...
every
time
it
has
come
up
the
state
has
taken
that
position.
that
is
the
best
way
that
i
can
answer
that.
ms.
nancy
alvarado
saggese
thank
you,
your
honor.
