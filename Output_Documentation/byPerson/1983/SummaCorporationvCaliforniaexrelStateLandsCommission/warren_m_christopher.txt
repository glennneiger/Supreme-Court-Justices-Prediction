mr.
warren
m.
christopher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fundamental
issue
before
you
is
whether
california
obtained
from
the
united
states
a
public
trust
property
interest
in
mexican
rancho
lands
which
are
now
held
by
private
parties
under
an
unqualified
federal
patent.
by
a
divided
vote,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
upon
its
admission
to
the
union,
california
obtained
a
public
trust
property
interest.
the
california
supreme
court
recognized
that
never
before
in
more
than
130
years
since
california
entered
the
union
had
this
public
trust
concept
been
extended
to
mexican
rancho
lands,
or
indeed
to
any
other
lands
to
which
california
had
never
previously
had
title.
the
theory
of
the
california
supreme
court
was
that
mexico
retained
a
public
trust
interest
when
it
conveyed
this
land
into
private
ownership
in
1839,
that
the
united
states
acquired
this
interest
when
it
annexed
california
in
1848,
and
that
california
succeeded
to
the
interest
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
when
it
entered
the
union
in
1850.
now,
this
public
trust
interest
carved
cut
by
california
is
a
permanent
and
pervasive
estate
in
land.
for
example,
it
is
so
pervasive
that
the
state
can
enter
upon
and
possess
the
land.
it
enables
the
state
to
construct
improvements
on
the
property
or,
on
the
other
hand,
to
require
that
the
property
be
held
as
open
space
without
compensation.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
the
holding
of
a
line
of
california
cases.
marx
v....
the
marx
case
cited
in
my
brief
is
the
principal
and
most
recent
case.
it
begins
with
the
california
fish
case
in
1913,
and
it
has
marched
through
a
long
series
of
cases.
the
public
trust
interest
which
has
been
marked
out
by
the
california
supreme
court
is
independent
of
any
exercise
of
police
power,
and
it
based
not
on
the
present
condition
of
the
property,
but
upon
its
historical
character
when
california
entered
the
union.
thus
this
property
interest
is
permanent
and
continues
to
exist
even
where
the
property
has
been
lawfully
filled
and
reclaimed
by
its
owner.
now,
as
the
court
knows,
it
was
settled
in
early
cases.
one
of
the
foundation
cases,
knight
versus
united
states
land
association,
settled
that
california
did
not
get
ownership
of
tidelands
within
mexican
land
grants
or
ranchos
when
it
entered
the
union.
the
reason
for
this
special
treatment
of
rancho
properties
or
mexican
grant
properties
was
the
international
duty
of
the
united
states
under
the
1848
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo.
the
rule
of
these
cases
is
not
directly
challenged
here,
but
it
is
indirectly
subverted
through
the
carving
out
of
this
very
extensive
public
trust
property
interest
in
rancho
lands.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
court
will
permit
and
authorize
the
erosion
of
private
rights
by
denying
the
owner
the
most
fundamental
aspects
of
ownership
under
the
california
supreme
court
public
trust
doctrine.
in
a
fundamental
sense,
this
case
turns
on
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
march
3,
1851,
which
is
known
as
the
mexican
claims
act.
this
act
was
the
mechanism
to
carry
out
the
commitment
of
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo,
which
of
course
as
you
know
ended
the
war
between
the
united
states
and
mexico.
to
heal
the
wounds
of
that
war,
the
united
states
made
a
commitment
that
the
property
rights
of
former
mexican
citizens
would
be
inviolably
respected,
inviolably
respected.
the
title
to
the
1851
act
sends
an
important
message.
the
title
is
an
act
to
ascertain
and
settle
private
land
claims
in
california.
thus
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
determine
once
and
for
all
the
validity
and
scope
of
land
claims
in
california,
to
issue
patents
to
those
that
proved
their
claims,
and
to
identify
the
remainder
as
public
domain.
it
was
a
jurisdiction,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
decide
rightly
or
wrongly,
and
whatever
decided
is
now
foreclosed.
this
is
the
line
of
cases
o'donnell
in
303
u.s.,
earlier
title
insurance,
and
thompson
land
company,
all
cited
in
my
brief.
the
crucial
point
is
that
between
the
claimants
and
the
united
states
the
1851
act
proceedings
were
tantamount
to
a
quiet
title
action.
decisions
in
favor
of
the
claimants
are
conclusive
against
the
united
states,
and
anyone
claiming
under
the
united
states,
as
california
is
here.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
well,
my
view
of
that
is
that
at
that
time,
that
issue
was
an
unsettled
issue.
i
will
take
your
assumption
for
the
moment,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
such
a
right
did
exist.
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
board
of
land
commissioners
under
the
1851
act
to
determine
questions
exactly
like
that.
the
board
of
land
commissioners
was
set
up
to
separate
the
public
domain
from
private
property,
and
in
accordance
with
that
jurisdiction,
the
board
of
land
commissioners
passed
on
such
questions
as
whether
or
not
there
was
such
a
right
under
mexican
law.
indeed,
the
land
commissioners
were
specifically
chosen
for
their
knowledge
of
mexican
law.
so,
until
the
act
of
1851
exercised
its
power
to
determine
these
rights,
that
question
was
an
uncertain
question,
but
it
was
well
within
the
power
of
the
board
of
land
commissioners
under
the
1851
act
to
resolve
exactly
that
kind
of
a
question.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
justice
stevens,
on
your
question,
i
would
say
that
after
california
entered
the
union,
and
before
the
1851
act
proceedings,
and
taking
your
assumption
that
such
a
right
did
exist--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--then
that
right
may
have
passed
to
california
under
the
equal
footing
clause,
although
there
is
a
subsidiary
question
there,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
equal
footing
clause
covered
such
partial
rights,
a
question
also
addressed
in
the
brief.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
i
think
that
is
a
much
different
case
than
the
case
here,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
clearest
cut
federal
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
state
of
california
received
anything
pursuant
to
the
equal
footing
clause
when
california
entered
the
union.
the
california
supreme
court
deliberately
put
this
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
title...
i'm
sorry,
this
property
interest
passed
from
mexico
to
the
united
states,
and
then
from
the
united
states
to
california
under
the
equal
footing
clause.
one
of
the
things
that
is
clearest
under
this
court's
decisions
is
that
what
a
state
initially
receives
under
the
equal
footing
clause
is
a
federal
question.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
what
i
call
the
humboldt
light
case,
california
land
commission,
justice
white's
opinion
in
a
footnote,
i
think,
says
specifically
that
what
a
state
received
initially
under
the
equal
footing
clause
is
a
federal
question.
now,
there
are
other
possible
federal
questions,
but
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
whether
that
is
a
federal
question.
other
possible
federal
questions
relate
to
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo
and
the
construction
of
the
1851
act,
but
on
that
question
i
think
there
is
no
doubt.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
chief
justice,
the
treaty
is
the
background
for
the
1851
act,
and
the
1851
act
is
the
crucial
basis
for
decision
here.
the
1851
act
provides
that
the
board
of
land
commissioners'
ruling
is
conclusive.
the
treaty
questions
are
only
important
background
for
both
the
1851
act
and
for
this
court's
ruling
in
earlier
cases
that
mexican
ranchos
are
in
a
special
category,
and
that
the
state
does
not
receive
tidelands
in
mexican
ranchos
when
it
entered
the
union.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
well,
you
certainly
have
to
decide
that
the
treaty
was
entitled...
the
treaty
was
intended
to
protect
the
rights
of
mexicans--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--yes,
i
believe
that's
a
federal
question
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
know
the
california
supreme
court
took
that
position.
the
land
titles
in
california
vary
all
up
and
down
the
coast
with
respect
to
those
tidelands
that
the
state
owns
because
they
received
them
under
the
equal
footing
clause.
many
of
those
have
been
granted
into
private
ownership.
many
of
them
are
held
in
public
ownership.
so
there
are
many
categories
of
tidelands
or
shorelands
in
california.
i
think
that
is
a
much
overstated
worry
on
the
part
of
the
california
supreme
court.
frankly,
there
is
a
checkerboarding
of
title
all
up
and
down
the
coast,
and
the
fact
that
it
has
been
settled
for
130
years
that
mexican
land
grants
are
in
a
special
category,
i
think,
would
indicate
that
it
would
land
stability
rather
than
promote
instability
for
the
court
to
vindicate
my
position
here
today.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
mr.
justice
powell,
the
california
public
trust
doctrine
is
so
ambitious
that
it
has
been
extended
to
land
on
the
shores
of
lakes
in
california.
that's
the
lakes
and
fogarty
case
which
was
here
on
certiorari,
but
the
court
denied
it
apparently
because
it
found
no
federal
question,
and
more
recently
the
california
public
trust
doctrine
has
been
extended
to
non-navigable
streams
feeding
into
lakes
in
california.
that
case
is
not
final,
but
i
think
you
get
some
idea
of
the
ambitiousness
of
this
doctrine
when
you
see
that
it
has
been
extended
one
place
after
another,
and
this
is
the
final
or
at
least
one
of...
this
is
the
latest,
this
is
the
latest
attempt
to
extend
that
doctrine--
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
--mr.
justice
powell,
this
decision
really
stands
on
its
own
bottom.
there
has
been,
as
i
said,
for
a
century
or
more
special
rules
with
respect
to
mexican
rancho
lands,
and
this
case
can
be
decided
solely
on
those
terms.
the
california
public
trust
doctrine
could
stand
with
respect
to
other
property,
and
you
could
decide
in
this
case
that
because
of
this
long
course
of
decision
beginning
with
knight
versus...
beginning
with
the
knight
case,
that
mexican
rancho
lands
are
in
a
special
category
because
of
the
treaty
duty,
because
of
the
international
duties
of
the
united
states
under
the
treaty
of
guadaloupe
hidalgo.
let
me
just
say
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
of
the
full
compliance
of
the
owners
of
the
rancho
here,
rancho
la
ballona,
with
all
the
administrative
and
statutory
procedures
set
up
under
the
mexican
claims
act.
the
end
of
that
procedure
was
the
granting
of
an
unqualified
patent
under
the
statute
itself
and
under
decisions
of
this
court
like
the
united
states
versus
o'donnell
in
303
u.s.
that
patent
is
conclusive
against
the
united
states
and
against
all
those
claiming
under
the
united
states,
such
as
the
state
of
california.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
only
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
on
a
factual
matter,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
his
question
answered
with
respect
to
the
map
attached
to
our
brief.
the
property
in
issue,
as
i
believe
you
were
correctly
saying
at
the
end
of
the
colloquy,
is
the
ballona
lagoon
area
there
just
north
of
the
channel.
the
area
of
black
line
is
the
area
which
the
state
says
may
be
public
trust.
in
other
words,
that
may
be
the
area
where
they
assert
public
trust
interests
if
they
win
this
case
with
respect
to
the
ballona
lagoon.
mr.
justice
brennan,
on
your
factual
question,
i
think
the
answer
is,
a
landowner,
our
client,
and
other
landowners
would
be
able
to
undertake
any
development
on
the
property
only
at
their
peril,
only
at
the
peril
that
subsequently
the
state
would
assert
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
public
trust.
mr.
warren
m.
christopher
that
determination
is
made
by
the
state
lands
commission,
but
after
a
rather
exhaustive
proceeding,
and
as
you
understand,
mr.
justice,
the
state
lands
commission
could
insist
that
the
property
be
kept
in
open
space
without
the
payment
of
compensation
if
you
were
to
uphold
this
public
trust.
with
respect
to
the
provision
of
the
grant
relating
to
traversing
roads,
i
think
i
should
say
before
i
conclude
that
that
provision
is
in
the
1839
mexican
grant,
but
it
does
not
appear
in
the
1873
patent
from
the
united
states
to
petitioner's
predecessors.
once
again,
that
is
the
kind
of
an
issue
the
board
of
land
commissioners
were
fully
competent
to
pass
on.
the
fact
that
it
does
not
appear
in
the
patent,
i
think,
should
be
decisive
here
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
language
preserved
so
broad
and
pervasive
and
permanent
a
trust...
or
a
property
interest
as
is
involved
here.
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
