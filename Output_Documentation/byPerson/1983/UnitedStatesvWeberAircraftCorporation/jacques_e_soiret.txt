mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
materials
at
issue
before
this
court
are
two
witness
statements
and
a
life
science
report
that
are
ten
years
of
age,
that
have
previously
been
released.
the
freedom
of
information
act
represented
a
dramatic
legislative
mandate
and
in
our
view
a
substantial
reversal
of
the
previous
policy
with
respect
to
how
government
agencies
were
to
treat
the
materials
with
which
they
had
cognizance.
the
principal
objectives
of
this
full
disclosure
i
don't
think
need
be
gone
into
in
oral
argument.
they're
set
forth
very
clearly
the
court's
opinion
in
justice
white's...
through
justice
white
in
the
mink
case.
our
position
in
this
case
is
simply
this:
that
the
materials
at
issue
here
are
not
included
within
exemption
5.
they
are
purely
factual.
pursuant
to
justice
blackmun's
question
a
moment
ago
drawing
the
distinction
between
the
mechanic's
report
in
machin
and
captain
hoover's
reports
here,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
distinction.
the
mechanics
of
course
don't
simply
look
at
the
evidence.
one
of
the
things
that
they
are
required
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
there
have
been
maintenance
or
installation
errors.
you
may
characterize
those
as
factual
or
not.
we
presume
that
they
were
given
the
same
promises
of
confidentiality
during
their
portion
as
were
the
rest
of
the
witnesses.
in
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
exemption
5,
i
think
we
first
have
to
look
to
what
i
consider
to
be,
at
least
respondents
do,
the
lead
case,
and
that's
the
mink
case,
because
that
gives
us
the
guidelines
as
to
what
we
are
to
do
to
determine
and
what
the
circuit
courts
are
to
do.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
i
think
if
you
do
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
court
reflected
in
merroll
that
in
order
to
determine
the
scope
and
what
it
means
you
have
to
make
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history.
when
the
statute
says
you
don't
have
to
turn
over
in
litigation
with
the
agency
not
required
by
law,
what
does
that
mean?
the
court
in
merroll
said
we
have
to
examine
the
legislative
history
to
make
that
determination.
so
i
think
you
do
look
squarely
at
the
statutory
language,
but
then
you
must
determine
whether
or
not
that,
the
machin
privilege,
is
assumed
into
exemption
5.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
it
is
not
so
much,
justice
rehnquist,
that
it's
unclear.
it's
what
meaning
does
it
have.
in
merroll,
the
same
language
was
at
issue
and
this
court
said
we
must
examine
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
"available
by
law"
means,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
weber,
and
that's
what
i
believe
this
court
did
in
merroll.
it
searched
the
legislative
history.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
it
needs
a
determination
to
see
what
is
it
that
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
words
"available
by
law".
what
did
it
mean?
the
same
common
sense
approach
which
was
referenced
in
mink
and
the
no
wooden
formula
caveat
which
that
opinion
contains
are
very
useful.
exemption
5
does
not
incorporate
a
privilege
for
witness
statements
and
factual
reports.
the
government
argued
in
the
merroll
case
that
5
incorporated
several
discovery
privileges
besides
the
executive
predecisional
or
deliberative
privilege
and
the
attorney
privileges.
the
court
in
its
opinion
said
it's
not
clear
that
5
incorporates
all
of
these
privileges,
and
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
indicated
that
the
court
admirably
recognizes
the
danger
of
incorporating
all
of
the
known
discovery
privileges.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
the
court
of
appeals
made
that
explicit
assumption.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
for
the
purposes
of
this
determination,
i
think
you
have
to
be
guided
by
the
assumption
that
the
ninth
circuit
made,
and
that
assumption
of
course
is
arguendo,
because
they
then
went
into
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
and
found
the
government's
position
wanting.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
i
concede
that
the
machin
case
established
a
privilege
prior
to
the
freedom
of
information
act.
subsequent
to
the
freedom
of
information
act,
in
that
context,
i
do
not
concede
it's
good
law
at
all,
because
i
think
the
freedom
of
information
act
absolutely
dispenses
with
the
basis
upon
which
the
privilege
in
machin
was
grounded,
and
i'll
get
to
those
comments
in
a
moment.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
there
is
tremendous
legislative
history,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
reflects
not
only
with
respect
to
number
5,
but
with
respect
to
exemptions
7
and
3,
that
congress
very
specifically
gave
us
legislative
history
to
indicate
to
us
that
they
had
no
intention
of
incorporating
this
machin
decision
in
exemption
5.
just
a
last
word
on
merroll.
our
understanding
of
the
merroll
decision
is
the
court,
after
making
a
review
of
the
legislative
history,
both
houses,
found
support
in
that
legislative
history
for
the
qualified
commercial
information
privilege
which
the
court
found
in
that
case.
and
analysis
of
the
privilege,
or
any
other
privilege,
as
the
court
said,
must
be
viewed
with
caution.
if
it's
a
privilege
other
than
those
recognized
in
the
legislative
history
which
the
court
reviewed,
we
ought
to
look
at
it
with
caution.
and
it's
the
respondent's
position
that
the
caution
ought
to
become
in
the
nature
of
a
red
alert
when
the
privilege
which
is
being
offered
for
consideration
is
one
based
on
an
efficiency
of
the
agency,
public
interest
standard,
which
is
the
identical
standard
that
was
swept
away
by
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
believe
that
the
privilege
here
is
a
pre...
that
is,
machin...
is
a
pre-foia
privilege
for
non-government
witness
statements,
announced
in
1963.
and
a
review
of
the
machin
rationale
for
that
decision
indicates
that
it
is
absolutely
counter
and
directly
contrary
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
the
cases
of
this
court
which
interpreted
that
act.
so
merroll
says
to
us,
let
us
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
what
does
it
tell
us
specifically
about
the
exemption
at
issue.
it
is
our
position
that
exemption
5
has
nothing
to
do
with
machin,
never
did,
neither
in
its
original
form
nor
in
its
amended
form,
as
the
solicitor
general's
office
points
out.
however,
we
disagree.
we
certainly
concede
it
was
amended,
but
it
was
amended,
we
believe,
because
it
had
to
deal
with
the
question
of
should
the
agency
disclose
or
withhold
documents
not
purely
law
or
policy,
but
those
which
contained
mix
documents.
that
is
the
reason
in
our
view
for
the
amendment
of
exemption
5.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
machin.
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
for
exemption
5
will
reveal,
we
believe,
no
member
of
congress
ever
referred
to
a
machin
privilege
nor
was
it
suggested,
nor
indeed
under
exemption
5
did
the
government
ever
even
assert
that
it
ought
to
be
included.
congress
specifically
refused
to
attach
any
viability
to
the
machin
privilege
in
this
context.
during
the
senate
hearings
both
the
department
of
defense
and
the
justice
department
specifically
asked
congress
to
give
them
relief
and
to
give
them
under
amendment
7
the
governmental
investigation
exemption,
a
machin
privilege.
and
during
those
hearings
they
argued
before
the
congress
that
there
wasn't
a
provision
protecting
the
material.
what
material?
the
machin-type
privilege
aircraft
accident
material
in
the
context
of
exemption
7.
they
specifically
requested
that
relief.
in
addition,
in
addition
to
the
testimony
before
both
houses
of
congress,
there
were
written
comments
which
were
sent
to
the
house
and
the
senate.
the
departments
of
defense
and
justice
asked
for
the
machin
privilege
to
be
incorporated
into
7.
congress
refused
and
left
exemption
7
exactly
the
way
it
was,
and
refused
to
provide
to
them
the
specific
protection
that
they
asked
for,
and
they
left
it
only
for
the
investigation
files
and
confidential
material
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief
that
machin
was
discussed
during
discussions
concerning
amendment
5.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
we
believe
that
position
to
be
in
error
and
the
legislative
history
in
our
belief
indicated
that
it
was
7
to
which
these
discussions
were
concerned.
the
government's
reply
brief
makes
a
curious
point.
it
appears
to
admit
that
the
discussions
took
place
with
respect
to
7,
but
nonetheless
suggested
that
congress
must
have
amended
number
5
to
reflect
the
government
concerns.
i
just
don't
think
that
there's
any
support
whatsoever
in
the
legislative
history
for
that
position.
and
we
don't
only
have
to
look
to
see
that
the
government
refused
to
amend
exemption
7
to
give
the
government...
congress
to
amend
exemption
7,
to
give
the
government
that
which
they're
seeking.
in
addition
to
going
to
congress
to
exempt
these
materials
under
7,
the
government
has
gone
to
congress
twice
and
requested
specific
legislation
pursuant
to
exemption
3,
which
allows
the
government
to
withhold
material
if
there
is
a
specific
statute
authorizing
the
withholding;
has
gone
to
congress
and
twice
requested
specific
authorization,
both
in
1980
and
1983,
and
requested
that
there
be
statutory
language
passed
allowing
a
machin-type
privilege
so
that
the
material
such
as
at
issue
in
this
case
could
be
withheld.
in
1980
the
department
of
defense
sent
a
request
for
legislation
and
draft
legislation
to
the
congress.
it
was
never
acted
on
by
either
house.
in
1983
the
executive
branch
sent
to
the
senate
proposed
legislation
which
found
its
way
into
the
defense
authorization
bill
without
debate,
but
when
the
house
and
senate
conference
committee
got
together
the
matter
was
struck
out
in
its
entirety
and
deleted
and
sent
back
for
further
study.
the
legislative
history
reflecting
that
further
study
is
reportable
to
the
congress
on
january
15th
of
1984.
that,
we
believe,
is
the
legislative
history
review
that
the
court
engaged
in
in
the
merroll
case
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
materials
were
available
by
law
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
government.
there
isn't
any
legislative
history
to
support
whatever
that
the
1963
opinion
of
circuit
judge
washington
was
intended
to
be
incorporated
in
exemption
5.
the
legislative
history
we
believe
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
we
note
in
footnote
2
of
the
merroll
decision
justice
stevens
pointed
out
that
it
was
indeed
curious
that
the
agency
there
before
the
court
sought
relief
under
exemption
4
and
was
turned
down,
and
the
court
in
its
majority
opinion
found
that
relief
appearing
in
exemption
5.
we
have
a
very
similar
situation
in
this
case.
justice
and
the
department
of
defense
have
gone
to
congress
under
two
other
exemptions
and
tried
to
get
the
protection
which
they
know
in
our
view
is
not
available
to
them
under
number
5.
so
in
addition
to
the
legislative
history,
which
we
think
is
clear
that
there
just
wasn't
any
intent,
it's
not
one
of
the
enunciated
privileges
of
attorney-client,
work
product,
the
executive
predecisional
privilege,
or
the
qualified
confidential
commercial
privilege
which
the
court
found
in
merroll
from
a
review
of
the
legislative
history.
in
addition,
there
are
some
analogous
materials
which
i
think
are
helpful
in
determining,
did
the
court
intend
a
machin-type
discovery
to
be
included.
the
court
will
recall
that
after
its
decision
in
faa
versus
robertson
the
congress
reversed
that
particular
case
specifically,
and
what
was
really
at
issue
here,
the
identical
type
of
aircraft
investigation
materials
that
are
available
in
this
case,
only
under
the
cognizance
of
the
federal
aircraft
administration,
the
identical
type
material.
and
the
court...
and
the
congress
in
short
order
reversed
that
particular
holding
of
the
court,
although
it
was
an
exemption
3
case,
and
said
that
it
would
not
permit
the
federal
aircraft
administration
to
withhold
aircraft
safety
information
because
it
felt
it
was
in
the
efficient
interest
of
the
agency
and
was
in
the
public
interest.
they
simply--
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
--well,
because
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
a
remand
and
said
the
material
that
we
were
seeking
would
be
released
subject
to
the
remand,
and
a
decision
was
made
not
to
file
a
cross-appeal.
mr.
jacques
e.
soiret
that's
true,
justice
o'connor.
it
was
a
tactical
decision
not
to
do
that.
in
addition
to
the
faa
versus
robertson
situation,
congress
has
made
other
clear
indications
of
its
intent,
and
it
mandated
the
national
transportation
safety
board
in
the
independent
safety
board
act
to
direct
that
the
information
be
released,
the
identical
type
of
information
that
the
air
force
seeks
to
withhold
in
this
case,
information
which
concerns
itself
with
safety
and
safety
investigations.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
review
which
is
called
for
in
merroll
and
which
i
believe
is
a
cornerstone
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
opinion
in
this
case,
a
review
of
that
legislative
history
will
indicate
that
there
isn't
any
support
for
the
idea
that
a
machin-type
privilege
is
one
which
ought
to
be
included
into
exemption
5.
indeed,
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
other
exemptions
in
which
the
government
has
sought
protection
indicates
quite
to
the
contrary.
for
these
and
the
reasons
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
believe
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
should
stand.
