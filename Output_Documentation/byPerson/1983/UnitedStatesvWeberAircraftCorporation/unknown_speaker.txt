unknown
speaker
do
they
concede
its
validity,
mr.
alito?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
are
we
going
to
have
to
decide,
whatever
is
the
scope
of
the
machin
privilege,
whether
it's
valid
as
a
matter
of
civil
discovery
law?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
we've
never
addressed
that,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever
addressed
the
validity
under
federal
civil
discovery
law
of
the
machin
privilege?
unknown
speaker
are
the
witnesses
testifying
under
oath
to
the
accident
board,
mr.
alito?
unknown
speaker
and
what,
do
they
swear
to
tell
the
truth,
the
whole
truth,
and
nothing
but
the
truth?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
isn't
it
odd
that
they
would
tell
more
to
the
safety
board
than
to
the
accident
board,
if
they
have
taken
the
oath
in
their
testimony
to
the
accident
board?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
possibility
that
there
might
be
better
questions
in
one
inquiry
than
in
the
other?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
does
the
record
show
that
these
witnesses
whose
statements
are
being
withheld
actually
were
promised
confidentiality?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
may
i
ask
one
question.
which
of
the
two
investigations
takes
place
first?
unknown
speaker
it
would
seem
to
me...
i'm
just
thinking
out
loud...
that
in
response
to
your
argument
that
the
net
result
will
be
the
same
if
you
cut
out
the
confidential
investigation,
that
you'd
get
the
other
anyway,
isn't
it
conceivable
that
the
second
investigation
might
omit
some
areas
of
questioning
that
they
explored
in
the
first,
that
they
might
not
have
if
they
just
were
starting
from
scratch?
unknown
speaker
do
the
officers
who
conduct
the
accident
investigation
have
access
to
the
safety
investigation
report
at
the
time
they
conduct
the
investigation?
unknown
speaker
just
the
public
part?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
at
the
time
this
freedom
of
information
act
suit
was
brought
the
united
states
had
not
been
joined
as
a
party
to
the
litigation
brought
by
hoover?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
analogy,
then,
if
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought
would
be
a
kind
of
third
party
discovery,
whether
the
united
states
could
have
been
subpoenaed
to
produce
this
stuff
as
a
third
party
that
wasn't
in
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
but
the
assumption
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
those
requests
would
have
been
properly
denied?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
witness...
a
witness,
is
he
subject
to
contempt
or
some
penalty
if
he
doesn't
show
up?
is
there
a
subpoena
power?
unknown
speaker
if
they
don't
they're
shot
at
dawn?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
some
sanction?
what
if
somebody
says,
i
just
don't
want
to
answer
that
question,
it's
too
embarrassing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
does
the
legislative
of
history
reflect
that
the
consideration
by
congress
these
safety
investigations
and
the
request
for
making
an
exemption
for
them
was
addressed
really
to
the
exemption
7
provisions,
rather
than
exemption
5?
and
of
course,
as
exemption
7
turned
out
it
was
limited
to
law
enforcement
investigations.
now,
would
a
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
indicate
that
that's
the
context
in
which
the
safety
investigations
were
discussed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
courts
generally
have
given
the
statutory
language
in
section
5
its
literal
meaning,
or
has
there
been
some
indication,
not
only
in
this
court,
in
others,
that
we
have
to
be
careful
about
applying
it
as
it
appears
to
be
written?
unknown
speaker
mr.
alito,
you
rely
a
good
bit
on
the
d.
c.
circuit's
machin
case,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
my
impression
that
there
the
court
held
that
the
air
force
mechanic's
factual
statements
were
not
privileged?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
captain
hoover's
statements
here,
he
being
an
employee
of
the
air
force?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
you
look
first
at
the
language
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
you
think
is
unclear
about
the
statutory
language?
it
says
"memoranda
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency?
"
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
"available
by
law"
that's
unclear
and
that
needs
refinement
by
looking
at
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
the
court
of
appeals
did
assume
that
the
statements
were
not
discoverable
in
civil
litigation
under
machin?
unknown
speaker
and
you
didn't
file,
i
guess,
a
cross-petition?
unknown
speaker
so
do
we
then
have
to
make
the
same
assumption
for
purposes
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
do
you
concede
that
machin
is
good
law?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
congress
explicitly
intended
to
modify
that
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
confused,
going
back
to
the
original
question
that
i
asked.
if
you
felt
that
the
material
involved
in
this
case
is
exactly
the
type
that
the
machin
court
would
have
released,
why
was
no
cross-petition
filed,
then,
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
it's
covered
by
the
machin
privilege?
unknown
speaker
but
when
it
came
up
here
then
we're
faced
with
this
problem,
of
course.
