mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
continued
existence
of
an
important
part
of
the
armed
forces
program
of
aviation
safety.
specifically,
the
issue
is
whether
statements
made
in
confidence
to
military
aviation
safety
investigators
must
be
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
even
though
those
statements
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
when
an
air
force
plane
is
involved
in
an
accident,
two
separate
investigations
are
generally
conducted.
the
first
is
called
a
safety
investigation
and,
as
the
name
implies,
its
sole
purpose
is
to
prevent
future
accidents.
witnesses
are
advised
that
their
statements
will
be
used
exclusively
for
purposes
of
safety
and
will
be
kept
confidential.
in
addition,
air
force
members
and
employees
are
assured
by
regulation
that
their
statements
will
not
be
used
against
them
in
administrative
or
disciplinary
proceedings.
under
present
practice,
the
safety
investigation
compiles
a
two-part
report.
the
first
part
contains
facts
except
for
those
facts
derived
from
confidential
statements.
this
part
of
the
report
is
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
the
second
part
contains
confidential
statements
as
well
as
the
findings,
analysis
and
recommendations
of
the
safety
investigation.
this
part
is
not
disclosed.
within
the
air
force,
the
safety
report
is
used,
of
course,
for
safety
purposes
and
is
distributed
strictly
on
a
need
to
know
basis.
in
addition,
to
the
extent
practicable
all
identifying
details
are
removed.
at
the
same
time,
a
second,
separate
investigation
is
also
conducted.
this
is
now
called
an
accident
investigation,
but
at
the
time
in
question
here
was
termed
a
collateral
investigation.
its
purpose
is
to
collect
and
preserve
evidence
for
all
purposes
other
than
safety,
for
use
in
court-martial
and
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings,
in
litigation
and
other
purposes.
statements
given
by
witnesses
to
the
first
investigation,
to
the
safety
investigation,
are
not
disclosed
to
the
accident
investigation,
but
a
list
of
the
witnesses
is
provided.
therefore,
the
second,
accident
investigation
will
generally
interview
the
same
witnesses
and
is
required
to
do
so
by
regulation
as
soon
as
possible.
this
entire
report
is
disclosed
to
the
public.
the
other
military
services
follow
similar
procedures.
for
more
than
20
years
now
since
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
machin
versus
zucker,
statements
made
in
confidence
to
military
aviation
safety
investigators
have
been
privileged
in
civil
discovery,
and
respondents
have
not
challenged
the
validity
or
scope
of
that
civil
discovery
privilege.
in
hundreds
of
cases,
air
force
safety--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
believe
they
expressly
concede
its
validity,
but
i
don't
read
their
briefs
as
challenging
the
availability
of
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
brennan.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
the
validity
of
the
statement
and
the
question
really
before
this
court
is
whether...
excuse
me--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
believe
the
court
has.
but
the
issue
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
we
brought
here
was
whether
these
statements
would
be
subject
to
disclosure
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
assuming
that
they
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
since
the
recognition
of
this
privilege
in
the
machin
decision,
air
force
safety
investigators
in
hundreds
of
cases
have
compared
the
statements
made
by
the
same
witnesses
regarding
the
same
accidents
to
these
two
separate
investigations
and,
not
surprisingly,
this
comparison
has
disclosed,
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
that
the
statements
made
to
the
safety
board,
which
are
made
under
promises
of
confidentiality,
frequently
contain
valuable
information
that
is
not
disclosed
to
the
accident
board.
indeed,
it
is
of
course
for
precisely
this
reason
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--air
force
members
and
employees
testify
under
oath
in
the
accident
investigation,
but
not
in
the
safety
investigation.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
assume
they
do,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it's
odd.
i
think
that's
human
nature.
people
will
protect
themselves
when
there's
a
possibility
that
their
statements
may
be
used
against
them.
when
they
are
supplying
information
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
injury
to
their
colleagues,
they
will
be
more
forthcoming
if
they
are
protected
against
any
possible
use
of
those
statements
against
them.
perhaps
it's
unfortunate,
but
i
think
that
that
is
a
well
recognized
fact
of
human
nature.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
that's
unlikely,
mr.
chief
justice.
both
boards
are
composed
of
experienced
rated
officers
and
commanders
are
required
by
regulation
to
make
all
necessary
technical
expertise
available
to
both
boards.
so
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
the
questions
asked
by
the
first
board
are
better
than
the
questions
asked
by
the
second
board.
and
in
addition,
since
the
safety
investigation
precedes
the
accident
investigation,
if
the
safety
investigator
happened
to
ask
a
particularly...
excuse
me...
the
safety
investigation
happened
to
ask
a
particularly
good
question
and
the
witness
remembered
it,
he
might
well
volunteer
that
information
when
he
was
questioned
later
by
the
accident
board.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
it
does,
justice
blackmun.
i
think
that
both
of
the
lower
courts
found
that
confidentiality
had
been
offered.
i
don't
believe
that
respondents
raised
that
issue
below,
but
if
they
did
raise
it
i
think
it
was
rejected
by
both
of
the
lower
courts.
in
any
event,
there
was
an
uncontroverted
affidavit
filed
in
district
court,
which
is
reproduced
in
our
joint
appendix,
in
which
the
responsible
air
force
official
claims
that
these
statements
had
been
obtained
under
pledges
of
confidentiality,
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware
there
has
been
no
factual
refutation
of
that.
in
any
event,
that
was
certainly
not
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
certainly
based
on
the
presumption
that
these
were
confidential
witness
statements.
the
information
that
is
contained
in
these
confidential
statements
has
contributed
to
a
dramatic
improvement
in
military
aviation
safety.
it
is
really
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
many
instances
it
has
saved
lives,
it
has
prevented
the
loss
of
valuable
aircraft,
and
it
has
contributed
to
the
national
defense.
now,
in
the
present
case
an
air
force
officer,
captain
richard
hoover,
was
seriously
injured
when
he
ejected
from
his
plane.
he
sued
respondents,
who
are
the
manufacturers
and
designers
of
some
of
the
ejection
equipment,
and
they
then
sought
release
of
the
air
force
reports.
the
air
force
disclosed
the
entire
accident
report
and
the
factual
portions
of
the
safety
report,
but
under
the
machin
privilege
withheld
the
confidential
witness
statements.
respondents
then
filed
freedom
of
information
act
requests
and
ultimately
brought
suit.
the
district
court
upheld
the
air
force
under
exemption
5,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
assuming
that
the
statements
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery,
the
court
nevertheless
concluded
that
exemption
5
did
not
incorporate
the
machin
privilege.
as
i
said,
then,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
these
confidential
statements
must
be
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
assuming
that
they
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
but
it's
important
to
recognize
that
if
statements
of
this
sort
are
available
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
then
the
civil
discovery
privilege
is
effectively
abolished
because
litigants
like
respondents
will
always
be
able
to
get
those
statements
under
fcia.
let
me
stress
at
the
outset
that
protecting
documents
like
this
would
not
in
any
way
undermine
the
purpose
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
because
at
least
from
a
perspective
looking
forward
the
issue
in
this
case,
unlike
some
freedom
of
information
act
cases,
is
not
whether
a
certain
type
of
information
will
or
will
not
be
available
to
the
public.
we
are
talking
here
about
a
kind
of
information
that
witnesses
simply
will
not
divulge
unless
confidentiality
is
assured,
and
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
air
force
parallel
investigation
with
almost
scientific
precision.
the
accident
investigation
serves
as
a
sort
of
control
group.
as
i
said,
a
witness
to
an
air
force
accident
is
generally
questioned
twice,
first
by
the
safety
board
and
then
by
the
accident
board.
the
safety
board
promises
confidentiality;
the
accident
board
does
not.
if
the
safety
board
could
not
make
those
promises
of
confidentiality,
then
the
statements
they
receive
would
be
essentially
the
same
as
the
statements
already
received
by
the
accident
board
and
already
available
to
the
public,
and
therefore
the
public
would
not
have
any
more
information
than
it
has
at
present,
but
those
responsible
for
military
aviation
safety
would
have
significantly
less.
in
our
view,
neither
the
language
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
nor
the
statute
nor
the
legislative
history
supports
this
senseless
result.
first,
the
statutory
language.
exemption
5,
of
course,
protects
inter-agency
or
intra-agency
memorandums
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation
with
the
agency.
and
what
this
means,
as
the
court
has
explained
on
a
number
of
occasions,
is
that
exemption
5
protects
those
documents
normally
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
here,
as
i
stated,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
assumed
that
these
statements
would
be
privileged
in
civil
litigation.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
safety
investigation...
well,
let
me
qualify
that,
justice
stevens.
the
two
investigations
take
place
at
essentially
the
same
time,
but
the
safety
investigation
has
priority
in
examining
witnesses
and
in
examining
tangible
evidence.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
questioning
in
the
second
investigation
will
be
appreciably
different
from
the
first.
the
second...
the
interviews
by
the
accident
board,
as
i
said,
are
required
by
regulation
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
witnesses
are
released
by
the
safety
investigation.
and
i
am
informed
that
in
appropriate
cases
witnesses
have
even
been
permitted
to
refresh
their
recollection
by
reviewing
their
statements
to
the
safety
investigation
before
they
testify
to
the
accident
board.
so,
while
of
course
it's
always
possible
that
two
questioners
will
not
ask
the
same
questions
and
that
one
will
omit
an
important
question
asked
by
the
other,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
that
will
occur
in
many
instances
under
this
setup.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no.
they
have
access
to
part
one
of
the
safety
investigation.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
which
is
the
public
part.
and
they
have
access
to
a
list
of
witnesses,
so
they
can
interview
the
same
witnesses.
but
they
are
always
different
people
and
they
do
not
have
access
to
the
confidential
information.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
the
united
states
was
originally
a
party
and
was
dismissed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
am
not
completely
sure
of
the
chronology.
i
believe
that
the
requests
for
discovery
were
made
before
the
united
states
was
dismissed,
and
i
believe
the
district
court
expressed...
i
know
that
the
district
court
said
that
he
was
inclined
to
deny
those
discovery
requests.
i
don't
believe
that
respondents
pressed
their
discovery
requests.
they
then
turned
around
and
filed
a
freedom
of
information
act
suit.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
is
not
subpoena
power.
members
and
employees
of
the
air
force
may
be
ordered
to
testify
before
these
hoards.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
know
what
the
question
is.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
assume
there
is
a
sanction
for
refusal
to
obey
a
lawful
order.
i
could
not
tell
you
exactly
what
the
punishment
would
be
in
this
instance.
i
don't
understand
respondents
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
made
a
serious
effort
to
reconcile
their
interpretation
of
exemption
5
with
the
statutory
language
that
i
just
discussed.
instead,
they
look
past
the
statutory
language
to
the
legislative
history.
that
is
the
heart
of
their
argument.
and
yet
what
is
curious
is
that
even
there
they
do
not
find
any
positive
support
for
their
argument.
on
the
contrary,
all
the
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
meant
what
it
said
when
it
enacted
exemption
5.
both
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
state
that
the
purpose
of
exemption
5
was
to
protect
those
documents
normally
privileged
in
civil
discovery,
and
of
course
as
i
said
the
statements
here
were
assumed
to
fall
into
that
category.
now,
it's
true
that
both
reports
specifically
mention
a
couple
of
exemptions,
but
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
that
those
passing
references
were
intended
to
constitute
an
exhaustive
list
of
the
incorporated
privileges.
in
addition
to
all
of
this,
there
is
even
specific
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
focused
on
the
desirability
of
protecting
the
very
type
of
statements
involved
in
this
case.
when
the
hearings
were
held
on
exemption
5,
that
provision
would
not
have
protected
statements
of
this
sort.
it
was
limited
to
documents
dealing
solely
with
matters
of
law
or
policy.
at
the
congressional
hearings
a
number
of
witnesses
pointed
out
that
these
statements
were
then
privileged
in
civil
discovery
and
should
not
have
to
be
disclosed.
congress
thereafter
amended
exemption
5
to
protect
those
documents
not
routinely
disclosed
in
civil
litigation,
and
congress
accomplished
this
by
recasting
exemption
5
in
language
similar
to
exemption
7
as
it
was
then
framed.
respondents
argue
that
these
statements
must
nevertheless
be
disclosed
because
these
facts
do
not
conclusively
establish
that
congress
had
the
machin
privilege
specifically
in
mind
when
it
amended
exemption
5.
but
this
argument
really
turns
the
usual
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
upside-down.
respondents
are
arguing
that
exemption
5
must
be
construed
in
a
way
that
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
history,
not
because
there
is
positive
evidence
supporting
their
interpretation
in
the
legislative
history...
excuse
me.
they
are
arguing
that
exemption
5
must
be
construed
in
a
way
that
is
flatly
contrary
to
the
statutory
language,
and
they
make
the
argument
not
because
there
is
positive
evidence
supporting
that
interpretation
in
the
legislative
history,
but
because
in
their
view
the
legislative
history
fails
to
show
with
sufficient
clarity
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
this
is
really
one
of
the
oddest
methods
of
statutory
construction
ever
advanced.
the
basis
for
this
method
of
statutory
construction
is
dictum
in
this
court's
decision
in
merroll.
but
neither
the
merroll
dictum
nor
the
holding
in
that
case
supports
their
conclusion.
in
merroll
the
court
noted
that
it
is
not
clear
that
exemption
5
incorporates
every
known
civil
discovery
privilege,
and
the
court
also
observed
that
any
claim
that
a
privilege
other
than
the
two
specifically
noted
in
the
legislative
history
was
incorporated
into
exemption
5
would
have
to
be
viewed
with
caution.
the
apparent
basis
for
this
observation
as
we
read
the
opinion
was
the
recognition
that
with
certain
civil
discovery
privileges
in
other
exemptions
and
may
have
intended
to
modify
their
scope.
but
here
the
machin
privilege
does
not
substantially
duplicate
any
other
foia
exemption,
and
i
think
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
read
the
caution
prescribed
by
merroll
as
requiring
that
exemption
5
be
construed
in
a
way
that
is
contrary
both
to
the
statutory
language
and
to
all
of
the
affirmative
evidence
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
references
by
the
justice
department
did
not
mention
any
specific
privilege
as
i
recall,
any
specific
exemption.
the
references
by
the
defense
department
did
refer
to
exemption
7,
but
i
think
that
that
actually
supports
our
argument
because,
as
i
noted,
congress
amended
exemption
5
by
recasting
it
in
language
similar
to
exemption
7
as
it
was
then
framed.
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
both
exemptions
5
and
7
read
very
differently
than
they
do
now.
as
i
said,
exemption
5
applied
to
documents
"dealing
solely
with
matters
of
law
or
policy.
"
and
exemption
7
concerned
documents
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
except
to
the
extent
available
by
law
to
a
private
party.
what
congress
did
was
to
amend
exemption
5
to
protect
documents
that
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
private
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency,
which
is
language
very
similar
to
the
language
in
exemption
5,
as
justice
powell
observed
in
his
opinion
in
the
robbins
tire
&
rubber
case.
so
i
think
that
if
anything
the
defense
department's
references
to
exemption
5
tend
to
show
that
congress
was
listening
carefully
to
what
the
defense
department
recommendation
was.
but
our
essential
argument
is
that
the
protection
of
these
privileges
follows
from
the
statutory
language,
and
since
there
is...
whatever
else
one
may
say
about
the
legislative
history,
it
certainly
does
not
clearly
show
that
congress
had
a
contrary
intent,
and
therefore
the
statutory
language
controls.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
the
court
has
expressed
the
view
that
exemption
5
may
be
unclear
in
ways
that
are
not
related
to
this
case.
but
i
see
nothing
unclear
about
it
insofar
as
it
applies
here.
it
protects
documents
that
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation
with
an
agency.
weber
aircraft
corporation
and
the
other
respondents
are
parties
other
than
an
agency.
these
documents
would
not
be
available
to
them
by
law
in
litigation
with
the
agency,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed,
and
they
have
not
contested
that.
so
i
fail
to
see
that
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
language
insofar
as
it
applies
here.
and
certainly
there
can't
be
a
claim
that
this
is
properly
dealt
with
in
another
foia
exemption,
because
i
see
no
other
exemption
that
is
related
in
any
substantial
way
to
the
privilege
at
issue
here.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
captain
hoover
was
a
person
who
was
involved
in
the
accident
and
he
made
a
statement
under
promises
of
confidentiality,
because
of
course
he
had
a
good
deal
to
gain
or
lose
depending
upon
the
nature
of
his
statements.
in
machin
or
machin,
the
air
force
mechanics
were
people
who
examined
the
wreckage
after
the
accident
took
place,
and
what
they
discovered
was
in
the
nature
of
the
facts
that
would
now
be
placed
in
part
one
of
the
safety
report.
they
were
simply
disinterested
technical
people
who
were
examining
the
tangible
evidence,
and
they
really
had
nothing
identifiable
to
gain
or
lose
by
shading
their
statements
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
the
court's
reference
to
private
parties
in
that
case
was
meant,
as
i
think
your
question
suggests,
to
distinguish
between
the
statements
of
people
who
testify
under
pledges
of
confidentiality
and
people
like
the
mechanics,
who
simply
provide
factual
information
and
would
now
be
placed
in
part
one
of
the
safety
report.
in
conclusion,
the
statements
involved
here
fall
within
the
plain
language
of
exemption
5.
everything
in
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
protect
documents
of
this
sort,
and
requiring
the
disclosure
of
statements
like
this
would
not
serve
the
purposes
of
foia
because
it
would
not
make
any
more
information
available
to
the
public
or
to
the
press
than
is
available
already.
it
would
simply
mean
less
information
for
those
people
trying
to
prevent
military
aircraft
crashes.
we
therefore
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
have
several
very
brief
points.
first,
as
a
factual
matter
i
think
it
is
not
true,
as
respondents
state,
that
the
issue
of
the
life
sciences
report
is
before
the
court.
we
specifically
did
not
petition
on
that
issue.
that
is
at
page
8,
footnote
9,
of
our
petition.
second
and
much
more
importantly,
respondents
concede
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument
the
statements
at
issue
would
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery.
yet
they
nevertheless
argue
that
these
documents
must
be
turned
over
to
them
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
fail
to
see
what
possible
sense
this
argument
makes.
they
are
themselves
litigants
in
a
suit
and
they
are
seeking
these
documents
for
purposes
of
discovery.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
for
documents
to
be
privileged
in
civil
discovery,
yet
available
to
litigants
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
think
in
argument
respondents
have
again
reiterated
this
very
odd
method
of
statutory
construction.
without
making
any
serious
effort
to
reconcile
their
interpretation
with
the
statutory
language,
they
argue
that
the
statements
must
nevertheless
be
turned
over
because
the
legislative
history
in
their
view
fails
to
show
with
sufficient
clarity
that
congress
meant
what
it
said
in
exemption
5.
this
is
not
the
way
statutes
are
usually
constructed.
and
finally,
i
think
it
makes
no
sense
to
argue
that
the
defense
department
requests
for
clarifying
legislation
in
this
area
have
elicited
any
congressional
skepticism
about
the
validity
of
the
machin
privilege.
in
the
ninety-sixth
congress,
with
only
a
one-day
hearing
the
house
committee
reported
cut
favorably
a
measure
much
broader
than
the
issue,
the
question
at
issue
here.
but
unfortunately
that
measure
died
because
the
term
of
congress
expired
shortly
thereafter.
in
the
present
congress
the
senate,
without
conducting
any
hearings,
passed
the
measure
that
would
have
provided
equivalent
relief,
but
no
such
provision
was
contained
in
the
house
bill
and
the
conferees
deferred
passage
pending
the
submission
of
some
explanatory
material.
certainly,
i
think
one
cannot
read
any
congressional
skepticism
about
the
need
for
protecting
these
statements
into
those
actions.
and
i
think
it
is
also
well
settled
that
an
agency's
requests
for
clarifying
legislation
should
not
elicit
adverse
inferences,
for
otherwise
agencies
would
hesitate
to
do
that
and
the
task
of
clarifying
statutory
ambiguities
would
rest
even
more
heavily
on
the
judiciary
than
it
does
at
present.
thank
you.
