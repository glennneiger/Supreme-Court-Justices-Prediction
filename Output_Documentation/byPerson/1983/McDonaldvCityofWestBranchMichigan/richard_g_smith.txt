mr.
richard
g.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
city
of
west
branch,
michigan...
which
is
a
community
of
about
1,800
people
in
the
middle
of
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
about
150
miles
north
or
detroit...
their
city
attorney,
their
assistant
city
attorney,
their
city
manager
and
their
chief
of
police.
this
is
a
1983
case
which
was
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan
for
the
northern
division,
united
states
district
court,
under
a...
after
we
had,
through
an
arbitration
process,
discharged
mr.
mcdonald,
the
plaintiff,
for
cause.
the
trial
took
about
six
days,
five
or
six
days,
and
at
the
conclusion
and
before
it
went
to
the
jury,
the
court
presented
special
questions
for
the
jury's
consideration.
incidentally,
over
my
objection.
but
those
questions
were
approved
by
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
and
those
questions
went
to
whether
or
not
mr.
mcdonald
received
due
process
on
each
of
his
claims.
and
the
jury
answered
in
the
case
of
every
one
of
the
defendants
that
he
had
received
due
process.
only
one
of
the
defendants
was
found
to
be
liable.
that
was
chief
longstreet.
and
this
half
a
million
dollar
claim
which
was
brought
in
that
court
requesting
not
only
that
money
but
all
of
the
back
pay
and
the
like
that
this
man
demanded,
the
jury
found
to
be
worth
$4,000
in
actual
damages
and
$4,000
in
punitive
damages.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
well,
it
i
think
it
goes
to
the
fact
that
we
are
told
here
that
in
an
arbitration
proceeding
that
the
arbitrator
cannot
design
a
relief
that
you
can
get
in
a
1983
action;
and
i
would
say
to
you
that
he'd
have
gotten
a
lot
more
had
he
won
the
arbitration
proceeding
than
he
did
in
this
litigation
that
he
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court.
we're
here
today
to
ask
this
court
to
give
preclusive
claim
effect
to
this
arbitration
opinion
that
was
entered
in
october
of
1977
and
uphold
the
appellate
court
for
the
sixth
circuit.
we
hope
that
in
weighing
the
evidence
insofar
as
mr.
mcdonald's
rights,
individual
rights
are
concerned,
that
you'll
also
give
consideration
to
the
rights
of
the
people
up
in
west
branch
to
be
free
of
vexatious
litigation
and
expense
as
they
had
to
put
up
with
in
this
case.
since
this
discharge,
the
record
will
show
that
mr.
mcdonald
has
had
his
arbitration
hearing;
he
has
litigated
his
unemployment
compensation
benefits;
he
has
litigated
his
pension
benefits;
and
he's
filed
a
worker's
compensation
claim
alleging
that
he
exacerbated
a
back
injury
which
we...
which
he
incurred
while
lifting
a
subject
out
of
an
automobile
two
years
before
we
discharged
him.
now,
we
believe
that
the...
mr.
mcdonald
had
a
fair
hearing
in
front
of
that
arbitrator,
who
incidentally
is
a
former
circuit
judge
of
wayne
county,
judge
bowles--
mr.
richard
g.
smith
--i
believe
that
he
did,
justice
o'connor,
and
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
i
base
it
on
this
fact:
i
base
it
on
the
fact
that
this
man's
claim
in
federal
court
was
that
he
was
put
upon,
intimidated,
and
his
first
amendment
rights
were
violated
because
he
was
engaging
in
union
activity.
now,
that
was
not,
i
will
fully
agree,
touched
upon
in
the
arbitration
hearing
because
it
was
never
raised.
it
wasn't
raised
by
mcdonald
in
his
efforts
to
defend
this
case.
and
it
was
in
the
contract
itself,
and
therefore,
i
think
that
it
was
an
arbitrable
issue
and
should
have
been
raised
at
that
point
in
time.
this...
this
allusion
to
what
chief
longstreet
did
or
didn't
do
because
he
was
charged
with
indiscretions
by
mr.
mcdonald
is
something
completely
new.
we
didn't
try
that
case
in...
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
that
issue.
those
weren't
the
questions
that
were
put
to
that
jury
to
decide.
where
that
issue
appears
is
up
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
for
the
first
time.
i
would
say
to
you
that...
that
under
that
contract
it's
part
of
the
essence
of
the
contract
to
raise
that
defense,
because
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
or
not
this
employee
was
fired
for
good
cause.
and
of
course
that
issue
should
be
raised
in
defense
if
in
fact
that
is
a
defense.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
i...
i
don't
understand--
mr.
richard
g.
smith
--in
any
event--
mr.
richard
g.
smith
--that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
i
think
he
waived
it.
i
think
that
his
lawyers
should
have
brought
that
to
the
attention
of
the
arbitrator.
and
i'm
going
to
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
reason
that
it
wasn't
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
arbitrator
is
that
the
issue
did
he
do
it
or
didn't
he
do
it
when
it
came
to
this
discharge
for
taking
indecent
liberties
with
this
young
woman
in
his
capacity
as
a
police
officer.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
no,
i
don't
think
he
could
have
gotten
the
punitive
damages,
although
i...
i've
given
that
some
thought.
there
is
nothing
that
i
see
in
the
contract
that
doesn't...
that
precludes
that
arbitrator
from
fashioning
any
type
of
relief
that
he
wanted
to
fashion.
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
i
don't
know
of
any
instance--
mr.
richard
g.
smith
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
no.
i
don't
believe
so,
now
i
don't...
it
would
be
against
the
city
and
the
city
only,
but
of
course
the
agent
of
the
city
was
the
chief
of
police.
in...
in
the
arbitration
hearing,
they
developed
160
pages
of
transcript.
there
were,
as
i've
indicated,
a
competent
arbitrator
in
judge
bowles.
they
were...
mr.
mcdonald
was
represented
by
two
representatives
of
the
union...
an
attorney,
a
labor
attorney...
incidentally,
there
was
another
attorney
in
the
picture
for
a
while
representing
mr....
mr.
mcdonald,
and
there's
the
suggestion
when
they
talk
about
mr.
mcdonald
not
controlling,
not
having
an
opportunity
to
control
the
proceedings,
we
believe
he
controlled
the
proceedings,
and
we
think
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
that...
with
that
attorney,
and
that's
why
mr.
claya
came
on
board
and
took
over
the...
took
over
the
defense.
it
was...
this
arbitration
was
done
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
arbitration
association.
the
arbitrator
at
the
close
of
the
proceeding
suggested
that
each
party
file
briefs.
briefs
were
filed.
the
arbitrator
took
the
matter
under
advisement
for,
oh,
i
don't
know,
thirty
days
and
then
wrote
a
thirteen-page
opinion
in
which
he
made
findings
of
fact
and
determined
that
this
man
should
be
fired
for
cause,
and
that
that
it
would
be
of
no
avail
to
allow
him
to
return
to
his
job.
we
believe
that
preclusive
effect
should
be
given
to
not
only...
to
all
issues;
that
is,
all
issues
that
could
have
been
raised
and
should
have
been
raised.
and
may
i
just
discuss
that
for
a
moment?
mr.
mcdonald,
if
you
read
the
record,
was
streetwise.
he
was
the
man
who
brought
the
union
into
this
police
department,
which
was
comprised
of
a
chief
of
police
and
three
officers.
he
negotiated
and
was
a
signatory
to
the
contract.
from
the
inception
he
administered
the
contract
because
he
was
the
union
steward.
and
as
i've
said,
he,
i
am
sure,
was
aware
of
that
portion
of
the
contract
touching
upon
the
inability
or
the
fact
that
the
city
could
not
in
any
way
penalize
him
for
being
in
union
activities,
because
exhibit
4,
plaintiff's
exhibit
4,
which
was
offered
in
evidence
and
received,
was
the
grievance
that
he
had
filed
a
few
weeks
or
months
before
the
other
grievance
which
this
arbitration
proceeding
grew
out
of.
and
that
grievance
was
because
he
was
complaining
that
the
chief
of
police
was
punishing
him
or
intimidating
him
because
of
union
activities.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
well,
in...
in
response
to
that,
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
well
aware
that
there
is
no
case
which
specifically
says
that
an
arbitration
hearing
can
be
given
claim
preclusion
effect.
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
do
that,
because
we
believe
that
that...
in
so
doing,
it...
it's...
you're
balancing
the
rights
of
this
individual
against
the
rights
of
this
community
and--
mr.
richard
g.
smith
--well,
i
think
there's
a
distinction
between...
between
a
title
vii
action
and
a
1983
action.
the
1983
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
post-civil
war
statute,
that
it
was
passed
in
order
that
the
states
and
the
communities
gave
due
process
to
individuals.
and
in
this
case
we
believe
they
did
give
due
process
to
this
individual.
and
that
now
that
the
states
have
developed
these
procedures,
now
that
the
states
are
giving
due
process,
as
they
have,
of
course,
for
many,
many
years,
i
believe
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
claim
preclusive
rule
which
says
when
an
individual
such
as
mr....
mr.
mcdonald
has
had
his
day
in
court,
when
mr....
when
an
individual
like
mr.
mcdonald
does
not
take
advantage
of
appeal,
when
mr.
mcdonald
complains
about
his
lawyers,
we're
going
to
give
it
preclusive
effect.
and
if
mr.
mcdonald
feels
that
he's
got
a
cause
of
action,
sue
the
union,
sue
his
lawyer
for
malpractice
if,
in
fact,
that's
where
he
believes
the
fault
lied,
not
subject
the
west
branches
of
this
country
and
these
individuals
from
litigating
up
through
the
federal
court
system
until
we
reach,
in
this
case,
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
that
he
said
that.
if...
if
so,
i
didn't
hear
it.
there
is...
there
is
an
appellate
process,
your
honor,
but
it's...
it's
very
limited,
and
the
courts
are
reluctant
to
overturn
an
arbitration
proceeding
of
any
kind
unless
it's
shown
there
was
fraud
and
the
like.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
that's
true.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
that's
true.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
that
would
be
true.
mr.
richard
g.
smith
to
the
state
court.
