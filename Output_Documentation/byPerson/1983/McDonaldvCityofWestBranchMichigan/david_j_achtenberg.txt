mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
gary
mcdonald
brought
this
section
1983
action
to
establish
that
his
discharge
violated
his
rights
under
the
constitution.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
he
should
have
been
forbidden
to
do
that
because
of
a
prior
arbitration
decision...
a
decision
which
did
not
deal
with
the
constitutional
issue,
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator
who
was
not
presented
with
and
did
not
decide
the
constitutional
issue.
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
and
in
barrentine
v.
arkansas-best
freight
this
court
held
that
prior
arbitration
awards
did
not
bar
subsequent
actions
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
under
title
vii.
and
the
issue
before
this
court
today
is
whether
there
is
some
reason
why
a
different
rule
should
apply
to
section
1983
cases.
mcdonald
was
discharged
after
receiving
and
becoming
involved
in
the
presentation
of
certain
citizen
complaints
against
the
chief
of
police.
these
were
complaints
by
members
of
the
public.
as
a
police
officer
he
had
received
from
at
least
six
different
women
complaints
that
the
chief
was
involved
in
some
form
of
sexual
misconduct
or
sexual
assault.
he
passed
these
on
to
various
city
officials,
and
an
investigation
of
the
chief
ensued.
the
chief
was
unhappy
about
this
and
threatened
mcdonald
and
threatened
one
of
the
other
officers.
he
told
mcdonald
on
at
least
two
occasions
that
he
would
have
his
job
for
starting
the
investigation.
this
harassment
culminated
when
mcdonald
set
up
a
meeting
where
one
of
the
complaining
women
was
to
present
certain
information
to
the
mayor
in
her
own
words.
the
chief
walked
into
that
meeting
and
threatened
the
woman,
he
threatened
mcdonald.
he
again
said
that
he
would
have
mcdonald's
job
for
starting
the
investigation.
the
very
next
day
the
chief
announced
to
the
city
council
that
mcdonald
would
be
fired,
and
the
actual
firing
took
place
the
day
after
that.
mcdonald
proceeded
to
file
a
grievance
under
the
grievance
procedure
provided
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
the
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
procedure
which
followed
exemplified
many
of
the
problems
which
are
involved
in
using
arbitration
in
this
sort
of
case.
mcdonald
was
provided
essentially
no
notice
of
the
only
charge
which
the
arbitrator
sustained
against
him...
the
charge
of
having
committed
a
sexual
assault
on
a
minor
female.
until
the
alleged
victim,
mrs.
dack,
took
the
stand
at
arbitration,
mcdonald
was
never
told
who
it
was
he
was
supposed
to
have
assaulted,
or
when
or
where
he
was
supposed
to
have
assaulted
her.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no.
the
attorney
assigned
to
him
by
the
union
did
not.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
don't
believe
it
can
be
said
that
he
had
not
made
the
request
on
numerous
occasions.
the
question
of
whether
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
waiver
under
the
contract
is
one
that
we
have
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
on.
just
as...
and
i
think
that
that
brings
us
to
one
of
the
other
problems
with
using
arbitration
to
resolve
individual
rights
questions;
and
that
is
that
mcdonald
did
not
control
his
own
defense.
it
was
not
his
decision
whether
to
ask
for
an
adjournment
or
not.
it
was
the
decision--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--it
was
the
decision
of
the
attorney
assigned
to
him
by
the
union
over
his
objection.
he...
he
requested...
he
asked
the
union
whether
he
could
have
his
own
attorney
present
and
was
told
he
could
not.
he
did
not
even
make
the
decision
to
go
to
arbitration.
that
decision
was
made
by
the
union.
the
union,
together
with
the
city,
without
the
involvement
of
mcdonald,
picked
the
arbitrator.
and
the
union's
attorney
elected
not
to
call
the
crucial
witness
who
would
have
corroborated
mcdonald's
testimony;
that
is
that
the
so-called
dack
incident
simply
never
occurred;
that
mcdonald
never
touched
barbara
dack,
that
he
never
said
anything
offensive
to
her.
that
witness
was
called
at
trial
and
was
undoubtedly
persuasive
corroboration
of
mcdonald's
testimony
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
don't
believe
so.
the...
the
lack
of
control
over
your
own
defense
in
a
situation
in
which
the
counsel
represents
you,
not
the
interests
of
the
union,
is
somewhat
different
than
the
situation
where
the
attorney
is
there
to
represent
the
union's
interest.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
we
don't
know
why
the
union's
lawyer
did
not
call
this
witness.
he
may
have
had
concerns
about
what
effects
that
might
have
on
the
witness,
on
the
witness
himself,
who
was
also
a
union
member.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
the
original
complaint
in
this
case
had
the
union
joined
in
a
state
law
pendant
claim
as
a
defendant
for
failure
of
adequate
representation.
the
district
court
dismissed
that,
not
on
the
merits
but
on
the
basis
that
it
did
not
want
to
take
pendant
jurisdiction
over
that
state
law
issue.
now,
that
has
not
been
further
pursued;
at
least
to
my
knowledge
that
has
not
been
pursued.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
believe
it
would
be
time
barred.
the
issue
presented
to
the
arbitrator
was
not
even
the
same
issue
which
is
presented
by
the
section
1983
complaint.
under
mount
healthy
v.
doyle,
the
issue
in
the
1983
complaint
is
one
of
motive,
one
of
what
was
in
chief
longstreet's
mind.
would
he
have
decided
to
discharge
mcdonald
even
without
the
first
amendment
activity?
the
question
the
arbitrator
decided
was
a
different
issue,
and
that
was
simply
whether
there
was
a
justification
assuming
pure
motive.
it's
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
where
the
arbitrator...
in
alexander
the
employee
was
charged
with
having
produced
too
many
defective
parts.
he
was
in
a
parts
plant.
the
arbitrator
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
produced
too
many
defective
parts
and
whether
that
was
grounds
under
the
contract
for
the
discharge,
but
not
with
the
issue
of
whether
that
was
the
real
reason
for
the
discharge,
whether
in
fact
racial
discrimination
was
being
masked
by
this
justification.
similarly
here
the
arbitrator
did
not
deal
with
the
issue
of
whether
anti-first
amendment
animus,
you
might
call
it,
was
being
masked
here
by
the
excuse
of
the...
of
the
dack
incident,
which...
or
the
alleged
dack
incident.
i
think
i
should
deal
with
the
argument
made
primarily
by
amicus
eeac
that
we
need
to
avoid...
we
need
to
grant
preclusion
in
this
case
because
otherwise
we
will
fill
the
courts
with
section
1983
cases.
i
don't
think
that
will
happen,
but
before
we
turn
to
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
we...
congress
has
expressed
a
fundamental
commitment
to
the
vindication
of
this
sort
of
right.
in
1871
when
federal
causes
of
action
were
few
and
far
between,
congress
thought
these
rights
were
important
enough
to
create
such
a
cause
of
action.
and
again
in
1976
when
it
passed
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
act,
congress
expressed
its
belief
that
these
cases
were
sufficiently
important
that
special
incentives
in
the
way
of
attorneys'
fees
for
prevailing
plaintiffs
should
be
provided
to
bring
them.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
sort
of
fundamental
congressional
commitment
should
be
lightly
ignored;
but
i
don't
think
that
considerations
of
judicial
economy
necessarily
militate
in
favor
of
granting
preclusion.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver,
and
i
believe
in
barrentine,
granting
a
rule
of
preclusion
will
give
incentives
to
unions
and
employees
to
skip
the
arbitration
process
and
instead
go
directly
into
court,
either
state
or
federal.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
they
could
skip
arbitration
as
to
the
section
1983
case--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--that's
correct.
they
could
not
skip
the
section
1983...
i'm
sorry...
they
could
not
skip
arbitration
as
to
their
contractual
claims.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
it
is
possible
that
they
might
not
agree
to
arbitration,
but
i
think
more
likely
that
they
would
exclude
specifically
this
sort
of
claim
rather
than
doing
so
implicitly,
as
i
think
they
have
in
most
cases.
they
might
explicitly
exclude
this
sort
of
claim
so
that
although
the
contractual
issue
might
be
resolved
in
arbitration,
the
1983
constitutional
claim
would
be
separated
out
and
clearly
could
not
be
precluded
from
being
brought
in
federal
court.
and
therefore,
cases
which
would
otherwise
be
resolved
in
arbitration,
either
because
the
employee
won
and
got
the
relief
he
was
looking
for,
or
because
he
lost
and
for
the
first
time
realized
that
there
were
witnesses
who
were
going
to
testify
against
him,
that
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
obviously
just
cause
might
not
seem
so
obvious
to
an
impartial
decisionmaker.
all
of
those
might--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--under
state
law
this
arbitration
decision
would
not
be
given
preclusive
effect
in
a
subsequent
action
to
vindicate
individual
rights.
it
would
be
given
a...
i'm
not
sure
it's
identical,
but
very
similar
to
the
same
sort
of
effect
that
the
federal
courts
give
it
in--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
in
michigan
civil
rights
commission
ex
rel.
boyd
v.
chrysler,
in
which
the
michigan
court
said
that...
quoted
the
portion
of
alexander
which
said
that
the
federal
court
should
try
the
case
de
novo.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
yeah.
that's
the...
as
i
understand
michigan
ex
rel.
boyd,
it
is
saying
that
in
state
court--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
don't--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
as
i
believe
you
yourself
said
in
kremer,
section
1738
does
not
apply
to
arbitration
awards.
it
does
not
apply
to
arbitration
awards
because
section--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
think
that
the
reasons
that
this
court
recited
in
alexander
and
barrentine
are
at
least
as
applicable
in
the
first
amendment
context,
the
1983
context,
as
they
were
in
the
context
of
title
vii
or
in
the
context
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
arbitrators
are
not
judges.
arbitrators
are
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence
that...
that
bind
courts.
they
do
not
have
an...
they
often
do
not
have
an
adequate
record.
they
often
are
not
lawyers.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
it
specifically
refers
to
judicial
proceedings--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
think...
i
think
it
would
be
a
bad
decision
to
do
so.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
yeah.
i
think
it'd
certainly
be
inconsistent
with
both
alexander
and
with
barrentine.
and
the
reasons
that
this
court
set
forth
in
those
two
cases
i
think
apply
at
least
as
strongly
here,
because
here
again
we
have
issues
which
involve
motive,
we
have
issues
which
involve
a
statute
which
has
been
subject
to
construction
since
1871,
and
a
constitution,
or
in
this
case
constitutional
amendment
which
has
been
subject
to
construction
long
before
that.
the...
the
issues
presented
in
these
cases
are
at
least
as
foreign
to
an
arbitrator
as
the
issues
presented
in
barrentine,
which
involved
a...
a
wage,
essentially
a
wage
dispute.
and
as
i
believe
the
chief
justice
said...
said
in
dissent
in
barrentine,
a
civil
rights
case
is
substantially
different
than
a
wage
case.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
it
would
not
in
a
subsequent
individual
rights
case.
if
this
were
a
suit
on
the
contract,
they
would
give
it
the
same...
not
exactly
the
same
as
i
read
the
case,
but
very
similar
to
the
sort
of
deference
given
by
the
steelworkers
trilogy.
in
fact,
the
michigan
courts
have
cited
the
steelworkers
trilogy
with
some
regularity,
just
as
they
have
cited
alexander
and
barrentine.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
on?
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
well,
i...
i...
i
don't...
you
know,
i
don't
say
that
i...
i
made
that
decision.
i
think
the
michigan
courts
did
in--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--all...
all
i
can
say
is
i
think
they're
wrong.
[laughter]
i
think
my...
my
thinking...
i
think
that
the
decision
in
michigan
ex
rel.
boyd
and
in
detroit
fire
fighters
pretty
clearly
deals
with
that
issue.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
don't
think
there
is
an
appeal
as
we
think
of
it.
there
are
ways
of
collaterally
attacking
the
arbitration
award.
those
are--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--yeah.
those
are
available
to
the
union,
and
there's
a
suit
for
breach
of
fair
representation
which
would
be
avail...
which
would
be
available
to
the
employee.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
he
"hired"
perhaps
involuntarily,
although
not
in
this
case.
he
was
a
member
of
the
union.
he
hired
the
union
to
represent
him
with
regard
to
the
contract,
with
regard
to
his
rights
in
collective
bargaining.
the--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--disputes
under
the
contract.
not--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--it
may,
and
it
may
also
be
a
dispute
under
the
constitution.
as
this
court
recognized,
i
think,
in
perry
v.
sindermann,
your
right
not
to
be
discharged
for
exercising
your
first
amendment
rights
is
independent
of
any
right
you
may
have
under
a
contract.
even
if
you
have
no
right
not
to
be
discharged
under
the
contract,
you
still
have
the
right
as
a
public
employee
not
to
be
discharged
for
exercise
of
your
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
think
the
state
court
as
an
issue
of
preclusion...
i
believe
that
the
correct
answer
is
that
the
state
court
has
to
follow
the
federal
rule.
if--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i
think
the
enactment
of
an
act
such
as
1983
or
title
vii
does.
but
i
think
that
even
if
you
applied
1738
sort
of
analysis,
under
haring
v.
prosise
and
i
think
also
under
migra,
this
court
has
held
the
most
preclusion
you
can
give
is
the
preclusion
that
the
state
gives.
i'll
point
out
that
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
at
all
clear
about
what
rule
of
preclusion
it
applied,
since
it
cited
no
state
cases
and
essentially
relied
on
the
restatement.
i...
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
don't
mean
to--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
you...
that...
i
don't
think
that
1738
governs
here,
because
we
do
not
have
a
state
court
decision.
i
think
if--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--a
state
court
decision
or
judicial
decision,
a
decision
covered
by
section
1738.
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
what
it
said
in
kremer
and
say
that
1738
applies,
i
still
think
we're
correct.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would
be
a
question
of
what
the
person
could
have
brought
in
the
act
in
that
action
and
who
brought
it.
if
the
action
in
the
state
court
permitted
the
simultaneous
bringing
of
the
1983
case,
as
it
would,
for
example,
in
missouri
where
you
could
both...
well,
at
least
from
an
administrative
decision
you
could
in
missouri;
i'm
not
sure
about
arbitration...
where
you
could
both
appeal
the
administrative
decision
and
bring
your
individual
rights
case.
but
i
think
if
the
only
thing
that
you
were
permitted
to
join
in
that
state
court
action
was
purely
an
appeal
of
the
arbitration
award,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
issue.
i
don't
mean
to
take
anything--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--no.
i...
i
think
arbitration
awards
are
entitled
to
less
deference
than
administrative.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
less
than
an
administrative
decision.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
believe
kremer
did.
i
think
in
kremer
essentially
the
court
said
that
administrators
are
entrusted
by
state
law
with
the
interpretation
of
statutes,
while
arbitrators
are
not.
so
that
i
think
that...
you
know,
i
don't
think
that
this
is...
i...
i
think
it
is
less
likely
that
deference
should
be
given
to
arbitration
awards
than
to
an
administrative
proceeding
by
an
administrator
created
by--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--and
i
think
that
the
reasons
indicated
for
giving
de
novo
review
for...
in
alexander
or
in
barrentine
apply
equally
here;
and
that
is
that
the
factfinding
process
in
arbitration
does
not
approach
that
of
judicial
proceedings.
i...
i
don't
mean
to
take
anything
away
from
arbitration.
i
don't
think
it's
an
insult
to
a
specialized
tribunal
to
say
that
it
works
best
in
its
area
of
expertise.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i
think
there
would
be
more
to
the
argument.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
well,
i
think
we
would
be
doing
a
great
deal
more
analysis
of
what
effect
the
state
courts
gave
to
a
confirmation
of
an
arbitration
award
in
a
subsequent
individual
rights
case.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
arbitration
is
the
way
that
congress
has
decided...
and
i
think
to
a
great
extent
the
state
courts
have
decided...
is
a
good
way
to
handle
disputes
in
the
area
of
what
we
call
industrial
self-government;
but
industrial
self-government
is
just
that.
that's
the
area
where
unions
and
management
together
make
the
rules
and
can
change
them,
define
the
employees'
rights
and
can
change
them,
define
the
employee...
the
procedure
for
vindicating
those
rights
and
can
change
them.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i'm
suggesting
that
in
the--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--i...
i
don't
mean
that
arbitration
doesn't
serve...
i
don't
mean
that
arbitration
doesn't
serve
in
other
areas
as
well,
but
the
common
thread
in
all
of
those
is
that
they
are
the
areas
where
the
people
have
agreed
that
this
is
the
procedure
that's
going
to
be
followed.
and
this
case
arises
in
an
area
where
congress
has
defined
the
right...
congress
has
defined
the
procedure;
the
constitution
defined
the
rights.
neither
the
union
nor
management
could
change
those
rights.
and
i
think
that
mcdonald
should
have
been
permitted,
as
he
was,
to
use
the
congressionally-prescribed
procedure
to
vindicate
those
constitutional
rights.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no,
they
did
not
decide
that
issue.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that
there
is...
in
the
past,
as
i
recall,
this
court
did
essentially
that.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
reason
not
to
reach
that
issue--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--yeah.
i
think
it
should
be...
it
should
be
decided
here.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no.
i...
i
don't
think
you
need
to
decide
that
issue,
because
i
think...
i
think
you
only
reach
that
issue
if
you
decide
that
section
1738
applies.
i
think
it
would
be
something
of
a
problem
if
we
had,
in
fact,
turned
to
the
laws
of
every
state
to
determine
this...
this
issue.
we
don't
do
that
under
title
vii.
we
don't
do
that
under
the
age
act.
we
don't
do
that
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
okay.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
just
a
little.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
to
the
extent
that
mcdonald
was
a
signatory
to
the
contract,
he
simply
signed
it
on
behalf
of
the
union.
he
was
not...
there
is
no
sense
in
which
mcdonald
was
personally
a
party
to
this
contract.
it's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
no.
i
believe
the
union--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--the
union
is
the
party
of
the
contract,
and
the
union
as
an
entity
has
the
right
to
enforce
it.
the
individuals
do
not.
the
individuals
only
have...
as
in
this
case,
for
example,
only
the
union
has
most
of
the
rights
under
this
contract.
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
i'm
suggesting
that
the...
the
record
indicates
that
he
did
not
make
that
decision,
that
the
decision
was
made
by
mr.
taft.
he
did
not
object
to
it.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
he,
you
know,
said
please
don't
take
me
to
arbitration.
that
didn't
happen.
the
decision
was
made--
mr.
david
j.
achtenberg
--well,
i...
i...
i
think
the
record
would
indicate
that
the
decision
was
made
without
his
assent
or
dissent.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
we...
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
we
would
claim
that
this
was
an
involuntary
arbitration.
the
decision
was
made.
he
cooperated
as
best
he
could
with
the
union
in
presenting
it.
secondly,
in
response
to
the
question
about
whether
our
position
is
consistent
with
kremer,
i
believe
at...
beginning
at
page
1895
of
the
supreme
court
reporter's
report
of
that
decision,
it
becomes
reasonably
clear
that
this
court
specifically
distinguished
between
arbitration
and
state
administrative
proceedings.
for
example,
in
discussing
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
and
the
characteristics
of
arbitration,
it
said,
"these
characteristics
cannot
be
attributed
to
state
administrative
boards
and
state
courts.
"
the
entire
section...
that
entire
section
of
the
opinion
seems
to
be
an
attempt
to
make
it
clear
that
this
is
not
overruling
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
or
that
arbitration
is
not
covered
by
the
same
sort
of
deference
that
is
due
to
state
court
decisions
under
section
1738.
thank
you.
