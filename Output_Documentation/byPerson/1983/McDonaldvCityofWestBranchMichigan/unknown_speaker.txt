unknown
speaker
did
he
ask
for
an
adjournment
to
prepare
to
meet
those
charges?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
bring
up
the
subject
of
waiver
possibly?
because
you're
complaining
about
something
now
that
he
didn't
object
to
then.
unknown
speaker
whose
decision
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
achetenberg,
is
that
any
different
than
if
this
had,
say,
been
a
trial
in
a
trial
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
and
the
petitioner's
lawyer
there
hadn't
called
a
witness.
i
mean
that's
kind
of
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
the
union
had
kind
of
a
secret
interest
in
not
calling
this
particular
witness,
or
just
that
the
union
lawyer
wasn't
particularly
diligent?
unknown
speaker
was
any
effort
made
after
the
arbitration
hearing
to
find
out,
to
raise
these
questions
with
the
attorney
who
represented
him?
unknown
speaker
if
you
did
not
prevail
here,
would
you
have
an
action
over
in
the
state
courts
against
the
union
or
the
union
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
contract
calls
for
arbitration,
they
can't
skip
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
speaking
of
the
general
claims
of
discharges,
all
the
working
conditions.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
unions
wouldn't
agree
to
arbitration
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
if
that
were
so?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
status
of
this
arbitration
decision
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the...
what
if
the
arbitration
turned
on
why
a
person
was
fired,
a
factual
issue,
and
any
suit
to
vindicate
an
individual
right
would
also
turn
on
the
same
fact?
how
about
in...
in...
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
which
you
would
say
would
not
be
totally
precluded
as
res
judicata,
but
what
about
the
factual
determination
in
the
arbitration
under
state
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
what
about...
how
about
the
trial
on...
how
about
a
trial
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
suppose
you're
wrong
about
that?
suppose
that
that
factual
determination
would
be
conclusive
in
the
state
suit.
let's
just
suppose
that.
unknown
speaker
then
wouldn't
that
have
just
as
much
impact
on
a
1983
suit
as
would
a
state
judicial
determination?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
suppose
the
state
court...
after
all,
i
may
have
said
that;
i
may
be
wrong.
[laughter]
i
frequently
am.
but
under
state
law,
let's
just
assume
the
arbitration
proceeding
had
just
as
much
binding
effect
as
a
judicial
determination
of
a
fact.
now,
why
shouldn't--
unknown
speaker
--section
1738,
too,
speaks
in
terms
of
judicial
procedures,
doesn't
it,
not
arbitration
proceedings.
it's
a
federal
statute
that
requires
federal
courts
to
give
full
faith
and
credit.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't...
even
if
1738
didn't
apply,
as
you
suggest
that
somebody
else
has
suggested,
that
still
doesn't
dispose
of
the
issue.
1738
doesn't
reach
it,
but
why
would...
well,
do
you
think
the
court
should
be
precluded
from
giving
the
same
finality
to
a
factual
determination
in
an
arbitration
as
a
state
court
would?
unknown
speaker
and
also
you
think
inconsistent
with
our
prior
cases.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
take
the
position
that
michigan
law
would
not
give
preclusive
effect
to
the
determinations
of
the
arbitrator?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your...
your
people...
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
don't
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
on
how
much--
--preclusive
effect.
--preclusive
effect
this
arbitration
provision
would
have.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but...
but...
but
your
colleagues
on
the
other
side
don't
agree
with
you,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
you
make
a
point
that
he
wasn't
informed,
your
client
wasn't
informed
about
an
appeal
from
the
arbitrator's
award.
does
the
union
contract
provide
for
appeal,
is
the
arbitration
final
and
binding?
unknown
speaker
for
fraud...
for
fraud,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
but
when
he
hired...
when
he
joined
the
union,
he,
in
effect,
hired
the
union
to
represent
him
in
all
matters
of
this
kind,
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
all
disputes
arising
under
the
contract.
isn't
that
covered?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
discharge...
a
discharge
is
a
dispute
under
the
contract,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
your
answers
to
justice
white
you
were
considering
whether
the
federal
court
might
be
required
to
follow
the
state
of
michigan
rule
on
preclusion.
i'd
just
like
to
ask
you
the
converse.
do
you
argue...
suppose
this
case
had
been
brought
in
state
court
under
section
1983;
would
the
state
court
be
free
to
make
its
own
decision
on
preclusion,
or
would
it
be
compelled
to
follow
a
federal
rule
that
you
advocate?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
in
effect
arguing
that
1983
compels
the
result
that
you're
seeking.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
rely
on
1738.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
under
1738
a
federal
court
can't
give
any
more
preclusion
than
the
state
would.
but
if
1738
isn't
even
applicable
to
this
case,
you
have
a
whole
new
ball
of
wax.
unknown
speaker
judicial
decision.
unknown
speaker
right.
was...
was
this
arbitration
award
ever
challenged
in
the
michigan
courts?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
if
it
had
been
challenged
and
the
michigan
courts
upheld
it,
so
you
would
have
a
judicial
proceeding
then
confirming
the
arbitration
award.
would
that
make
your
analysis
of
1738
any
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
counsel,
you
seem
to
equate
arbitration
proceedings
and
arbitration
awards
with
administrative
proceedings.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
less
than
administrative?
unknown
speaker
what
cases
have
held
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that's
argument
wholly
beside
the
point,
it
seems
to
me,
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
determination
of
fact,
of
historical
fact
around
which
a
case
turns.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the...
with
the
construction
of
the
statute
or
anything
else.
it's
a
question
of
fact.
and
it
may
not...
and
it
may
not
be
a
question
of
res
judicata,
but
it
might
be
of
collateral
estoppel.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
state
court
had,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
the
state
court
had
confirmed
the
award,
i
take
it
you
would...
you
would
think
there
would
be
more
to
the
argument
that
the
factual
determinations
of
the
arbitrator
would
be
conclusive.
unknown
speaker
yes.
quite
a
bit
more,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
arbitration,
the
arbitration
mechanism
is
not
used
for
matters
of
great
moment
involving
millions,
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars?
unknown
speaker
all
arbitrations
aren't
just
wage
disputes
or
discharge
disputes.
many
arbitrations
involve
huge
matters
of
importance,
and
sometimes
they
have
former
judges
or
retired
justices
of
this
court
as
arbitrators.
they
must
be
important.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
if
we
should
conclude...
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
we
should...
but
if
we
should
conclude
that
you
have
to
look
to
state
law,
either
because
1738
applies
or
would
apply
if
the
arbitration
award
had
been
confirmed
or
something
like
that,
would
you
agree
that
this
case
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
what
the
state
law
rule
is?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
decide
that,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
suggesting
we
should
decide
it
if
we
take
that
route?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
generally
make
first
decisions
on
state
law
questions.
at
least
i'm
not
used
to
doing
that.
well,
anyway,
your...
your
view
is
we
should
decide
it.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
have
to
decide
it
or
not?
i
thought
your
argument
was
it
was
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
even
if
state
law...
even
if
in
a
state
individual
rights
suit,
even
if
the
state
would
give
conclusive...
conclusive
effect
or
preclusive
effect
to
this
arbitration
award,
that
the
1983
suit
could
still
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
consistent
with
kremer?
you
can
respond
to
that
later,
if
you
want.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
true
in
every
lawsuit?
lawyers
always
ask
for
the
sky
and
come
up
with
something
much
less
than
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
did
the
arbitrator,
in
your
view,
have
authority
to
determine
the
constitutional
issue
raised?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
base
that
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
sound
a
lot
like
the
first
amendment
claim
to
me.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
he
could
have
but
did
not
raise
this
claim
of
union
activity
in
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
so
your
position
is
he
waived
it
by
not
raising
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
could
he
have
gotten
the
punitive
damages
against
the
chief
of
police
in
the
arbitration
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
given
relief
against
the
individual
chief
of
police
as
well
as
against
the
city?
unknown
speaker
because
that's
the
only
party
that...
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith?
unknown
speaker
the
only
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
the
arbitration
award
should
have
been
given
preclusive
effect
by
the
district
court,
i
think.
speaking
for
me
at
least,
this
kind
of
factual
background
of
the
characters,
the
people
involved,
doesn't
shed
a
great
deal
of
light
on
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
harkins,
how
would
that
square
with
what
the
court
did
in
alexander
against
gardner-denver
company
in
the
title
vii
context?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
what
you've
just
said
prompts
me
to
ask
this
question.
was
there
a
right
of
appeal
from
the
arbitration
award?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that's
the
opposite
of
what
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
says,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
it's...
it's
limited
to
such
things
as
fraud.
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
anything
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
review
of
the
record;
it
is
a
collateral
attack,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
when
you
used
the
term
"appeal"
in
answer,
do
you
mean
appeal
within
the
arbitration
structure,
like
to
a
national
organization,
or
do
you
mean
appeal
from
the
arbitrator
to
the
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
every
member
of
the
union
a
party
to
the
contract
in
all
practical
effect
and
legal?
unknown
speaker
a
contract
made
on
behalf
of
all
the
members
by
the
union
as
an
entity.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
he
had
never
agreed
to
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
then
i'm
not
sure...
then
i'm
not
sure
what
your
point
is
about
it.
he
either
consented
to
the
arbitration
or
he
didn't.
now,
in
this
record
it
would
appear
beyond
any
question
that
he
did
consent
to
the
arbitration.
