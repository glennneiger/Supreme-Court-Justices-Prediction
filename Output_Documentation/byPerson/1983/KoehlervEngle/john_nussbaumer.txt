mr.
john
nussbaumer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
going
to
skip
directly
to
the
procedural
default
issue,
since
the
state
has
not
argued
the
retroactivity
issue.
this
procedural
default
argument
should
not
detain
you
long.
before
the
sandstrom
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
it
would
not
enforce
its
procedural
default
rules
for
cases
involving
a
conclusive
presumption
of
intent
or
an
instruction
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defense.
after
sandstrom,
the
michigan
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
it
was
exempting
sandstrom
errors
from
the
state's
procedural
default
rules.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
right,
your
honor.
after
the
wright
case,
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
have
addressed
the
exact
situation
you
have
before
you
today:
a
delayed
appeal
in
which
the
issue
was
not
objected
to
a
trial
and
not
raised
on
the
appeal
as
of
wright
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
and
in
those
cases,
they
have
said
we
will
not
enforce
our
procedural
default
rules.
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
a
conclusion
that
the
state
enforces
its
rules
for
sandstrom
errors.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that
is
the
question,
justice
rehnquist.
what
i'm
saying
is,
before
sandstrom,
the
michigan
supreme
court
specifically
said
we're
not
going
to
enforce
our
procedural
default
rules
for
conclusive
presumption
instructions.
that's
people
v.
guillet.
these
are
all
cited
in
the
briefs.
and
they
held
that,
where
no
objection
had
been
made
to
a
burden-shifting
instruction,
they
would
not
enforce
the
rules.
that
happened
prior
to
this
appeal.
then,
afterwards,
when
they
got
to
sandstrom,
they
said
we're
not
going
to
enforce
our
rules
for
thee
kinds
of
errors.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
the
courts
issue
standard,
one-line
orders
denying
leave
to
appeal.
they
did
not
specifically
address
the
question
of
the
procedural
default.
my
argument
is
that,
given
that
before
sandstrom
they
didn't
enforce
these
rules,
and
that
after
sandstrom
they
said
we're
not
going
to
enforce
these
rules,
and
that
they
have
addressed
cases
just
like
this
one
and
have
not
enforced
the
rules,
there's
no
basis
for
inferring
that
they
did
enforce
the
rule
in
this
case.
i
want
to
proceed
now
to
the
harmless
error
argument.
i
think
that's
really
what
this
case
is
all
about.
i
want
to
respond,
first,
justice
blackmun,
to
your
question
about
didn't
the
jury's
verdict,
that
this
was
premeditated
murder,
render
the
error
harmless?
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
concede
that
this
was
not
a
conclusive
presumption
instruction,
and
i
therefore
do
concede
that
this
kind
of
instruction,
a
burden--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--because
it
was
a
burden-shifting
instruction.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
but
i
only
agree
to
a
point
of
where
i
think
your
honor
is
going.
i
think
the
limit
of
how
much
you
should
look
at
the
evidence
is
whether
there
was
conflicting
evidence
on
the
element
of
the
crime
to
which
the
instruction
related.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
intent.
that's
right.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
and
that's...
i
think,
basically,
that's
the
approach,
legally,
that
you
should
follow
with
a
burden-shifting
instruction.
where
intent
is
disputed
and
there
is
conflicting
evidence
on
that
point,
it
should
be
reversible
error.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
he
testified
that
he
did
not
recall
making
any
statements
to
the
police
at
the
scene.
and
there
was
an
explanation.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
the
evidence
of
the
shooting
was
that
he
fired
one
shoot
at
very
close
range.
the
deceased
turned
and
ran.
and
he
then
fired
three
more
shots
in
the
space
of
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
let
me
make
sure
you're
clear
on
what
these
instructions
did.
the
court
began
by
telling
the
jury
that
malice,
a
term
which
the
court
used
interchangeably
with
intent
to
kill,
was
to
be
implied
from
any
deliberate
or
cruel
act,
however
sudden.
the
court
then
gave
the
instruction
that,
because
we
can't
look
into
a
person's
mind
and
determine
what
they
were
thinking,
the
law
provides
a
rule
of
thumb
that
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
acts.
the
court
then
reinforced
the
idea
that
intent
was
to
be
determined
from
the
nature
of
mr.
engle's
acts,
by
explaining
that
legal
presumption
as
like
the
old
saying
that
"actions
speak
louder
than
words".
the
court
then
specifically
directed
the
jury's
attention
to
three
undisputed
facts
from
the
prosecutor's
case,
the
natural
consequence
of
which
was
death:
the
use
of
a
deadly
weapon,
evidence
of
close-range
firing,
and
the
number
and
location
of
the
wounds,
any
one
of
which
would
have
been
sufficient
to
trigger
the
presumption
of
intent
the
court
had
just
given
them.
now,
the
state
goes
on
and
argues
that,
well,
the
rest
of
the
instructions
cure
this
error.
i
really
encourage
you
to
read
the
rest
of
these
instructions
closely.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
am
answering
it
by
saying
that
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
picked
out
a
few
isolated
instructions.
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
burden-shifting
instructions
permeated
this
charge
to
the
jury
from
beginning
to
end.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
exactly
what
you
said
should
do
in
cupp.
it
read
these
as
a
whole.
it
went
on
to
look
at
the
instructions
with
regard
to
the
defenses
presented.
with
regard
to
insanity,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
the
prosecution
was
entitled
to
a
presumption
that
the
defendant
was
sane
and
responsible
for
his
acts,
and
then
defined
the
quantum
of
evidence
necessary
to
overcome
that
presumption
as
evidence
raising
a
reasonable
doubt
of
insanity.
with
regard
to
the
particular
mental
illness
defense
presented
of
dissociative
reaction,
the
judge
said
where
this
can
be
proved,
it
would
constitute
a
defense.
what
i'm
saying
to
you
is
that
these
instruction,
from
top
to
bottom,
shifted
the
burden
of
proof.
it
wasn't
a
case
of
isolating
one
single
line
out
of
the
instructions.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
there's
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that,
unless
the
state
does
not
require
the
defendant
to
carry
any
burden.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that
charge
was
not
affirmed.
this
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
case
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
addressed.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
if
you
look
at
people
v.
kruggman,
that
is
a
michigan
supreme
court
decision
found
at
377
michigan
559,
page
563,
you
will
see
that
the
judge's
instruction
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
with
regard
to
insanity
was
clearly
wrong.
in
fact,
we
raised
that
issue
on
state
law
grounds
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
all
i
am
saying
is
that
the
state
has
pointed
to
this
instruction,
this
particular
instruction,
the
insanity
instruction,
and
said
this
cured
any
burden-shifting
effect.
in
fact,
the
judge
told
the
jury
that
only
where
the
defendant's
defense
could
be
proven
would
it
constitute
a
defense.
that's
the
kind
of
instruction
which
clearly
tells
the
jury
the
defendant
has
to
prove
his
defense.
and
that's
not
michigan
law.
intent
was...
i
started
to
say
at
the
beginning,
i
was
going
to
reply
to
your
question,
justice
blackum.
i'll
get
to
that
now.
this
instruction,
particularly
the
instruction
that
the
law
gives
us
a
rule
of
thumb
that
a
person
is
presume
to
intend
the
consequences
of
his
acts,
did
affect
the
first
degree
premeditated
murder
finding.
the
jury
in
this
case,
for
example,
could
have
found,
from
mr.
engle's
act
of
bringing
a
gun
to
the
auto
plant
with
him,
driving
to
the
plant
with
a
gun,
from
that
act,
together
with
the
presumption
of
law
the
court
had
just
given
them,
they
could
infer
the
necessary
element
of
premeditation.
these
instructions
were
not
carefully
separated
out.
the
judge
didn't
say,
all
right,
here's
first,
here's
second.
they
were
all
combined.
the
issue
of
intent
and
malice
were
all
balled
up
into
a
whole
series
of
instructions.
so
these
instructions
very
well
could
have
led
the
jury
to
presume
the
existence
of
the
necessary
mens
rea,
unless
mr.
engle
proved
otherwise.
one
of
the
state's
main
points
in
this
case
is
that
only
irresistible
impulse
was
challenged.
that's
not
correct.
the
defense
counsel,
in
closing,
argued
first
that
mr.
engle
had
not
planned
or
intended
to
kill
the
deceased.
he
argued,
second,
that
mr.
engle
was
not
mentally
there
at
the
time
this
happened.
he
argued,
third,
that
mr.
engle
did
not
know
right
from
wrong
at
the
time;
and,
lastly,
he
argued
irresistible
impulse.
the
trial
prosecutor
himself
recognized
that
intent
was
a
hotly-disputed
issue
in
this
case,
because
he
specifically
responded
to
each
one
of
those
claims
in
his
closing
argument.
the
trial
judge
also
recognized
that
everything
about
intent
was
in
dispute
in
this
case;
in
fact,
instructing
the
jury
that
mr.
engle's
claim
was
that
he
had
not
known
what
he
was
doing,
and
that
the
jury
had
to
decide
whether
he
was
capable
of
forming
a
premeditated
intent
to
kill.
the
state
itself,
in
the
very
first
appellate
pleadings
filed
in
this
case,
argue
that
intent
was
the
crucial
issue
in
the
case.
on
page
14
of
the
prosecution's
brief
on
appeal,
in
michigan
court
of
appeals
case
no.
18951,
the
prosecution
characterized
the
defense
presented
in
the
following
language,
and
i
quote:
"the
defense
in
this
case
was
that
the
intent
to
kill
was
not
there,
as
the
defendant
was
temporarily
insane
or
was
so
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
beverages
as
to
not
have
the
intent
to
kill.
"
that's
the
state
talking.
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
in
its
published
decision,
reviewing
the
same
record
you
have
before
you
today,
characterized
the
defense
presented
as
follows:
"the
defense
was
that
defendant
was
so
under
the
influence
of
librium,
beer,
and
whiskey,
that
he
could
not
have
formed
the
specific
intent
to
commit
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder.
"
everyone
who
has
looked
at
this
case
before
you
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
state...
that
intent
was
the
crucial
issue
in
this
case.
and
all
of
these
series
of
instructions
related
to
the
issue
of
intent
and
raised
a
presumption
of
intent
for
the
jury
to
follow.
the
evidence
presented
on
this
point
was
conflicting.
mr.
engle
himself
testified
that
he
consumed
an
enormous
amount
of
alcohol
during
the
three
days
preceding
the
shooting,
as
well
as
ingesting
four
librium
tablets
on
the
last
day.
and
he
flatly
denied
ever
intending
to
kill
the
deceased.
he
testified,
he
conceded
that
he
did
the
act
of
shooting,
but
he
maintained
that
he
had
not
known
what
he
was
doing.
dr.
mary
ainsley,
a
qualified
psychiatrist,
supported
this
testimony.
she
testified
that,
as
a
result
of
a
whole
series
of
personal
tragedies
culminating
in
the
loss
of
his
job--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--they
were.
an
improper--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--yes;
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
'72,
december.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
yes.
trial
was
in
july
of
'73.
yes;
all
these
facts
were
before
an
improperly
instructed
jury.
dr.
ainsley
testified
that
mr.
engle
suffered
a
dissociative
reaction,
mental
breakdown,
on
the
night
of
this
shooting.
she
testified
that
such
breakdowns
are
accompanied
by
impaired
perception,
judgment,
and
consciousness,
and
that,
in
her
judgment,
the
combination
of
the
intoxicants
and
the
mental
stresses
this
man
had
been
under
were
sufficient
to
have
blocked
his
consciousness
to
the
point
where
he
would
not
have
been
fully
aware
of
what
he
was
doing.
i'd
ask
your
honors
to
note
that
that
appears
on
pages
359
through
361
of
the
transcripts,
not
360
as
i
stated
in
my
brief.
regarding
mr.
engle's
apparent
ability
to
function
during
this
period,
to
walk
and
talk,
even
the
state's
psychiatrist
conceded,
at
page
420
of
his
testimony,
that
when
a
breakdown
of
this
type
occurs,
somnambulistic
behavior
similar
to
sleepwalking
and
sleeptalking,
is
possible,
in
which
an
individual
may
say
and
do
things,
but
not
be
fully
consciously
aware
of
what
they
are
doing.
and,
chief
justice
burger,
with
regard
to
your
question
regarding
the
statements,
dr.
ainsley
testified
that
mr.
engle
was
able
to
recall
what
had
happened
during
this
period
of
time,
as
you
or
i
might
recall
a
nightmare
upon
waking.
and
that
was
the
reason
why,
even
though
he
was
not
conscious
at
the
time,
he
was
able
to
recall
these
things,
like
a
dream.
and
that's
what
defense
counsel
argued
in
closing.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
he
was
questioned
about
that
by
defense
counsel.
the
questions
were
to
the
effect,
well,
if
this
did
happen,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
some
of
the
things
that
are
possible
are
this
kind
of
behavior?
and
he
agreed
to
that
kind
of
statement.
now,
in
addition
to
this
expert
testimony,
there
was
lay
testimony
from
each
of
the
witnesses
who
came
in
contact
with
mr.
engle
before
this
shooting
as
to
his
abnormal
and
unusual
behavior.
the
same
witness
who
testified
that
mr.
engle
said
he
was
going
to
kill
a
guy
when
he
came
into
this
plant,
testified
that
when
mr.
engle
said
this,
he
was
not
acting
normally.
he
was
crying.
he
had
a
nervous
pitch
to
his
voice,
and
the
things
he
was
saying
did
not
make
much
sense.
two
other
witnesses
who
came
in
contact
with
mr.
engle
before
the
shooting
independently
testified
to
the
same
thing.
they
both
testified
that
they
noted
a
very
strange
look
in
his
eyes,
a
look
which
they
described
as
something
they'd
never
before
seen
in
their
lives.
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
mr.
engle
had
a
gun
with
him
on
this
night,
he
himself
testified
that
his
best
friend
had
been
murdered
in
a
nearby
bar
a
few
months
before
this,
and
that
after
that
he
bought
a
pistol
and
carried
it
with
him
wherever
he
went
for
self-protection.
in
detroit,
i'd
say
that
would
be
very
believable
testimony.
while
there
is
certainly
evidence
supporting
the
state's
position
that
this
was
a
premeditated
killing,
there
was
contrary,
conflicting
evidence
regarding
mr.
engle's
mental
state
that
presented
a
genuine
factual
dispute
for
the
jury
to
resolve.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
justice
white,
i
agree
that
this
is
a
discretionary
matter.
it's
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
in
united
states
v.
auritz,
you
faced
this
same
situation,
where
the
government
raised
a
retroactivity
argument
that
had
not
been
raised
below,
and
you
refused
to
consider
it.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
don't
think--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--since
you
have
asked,
i
will.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
for
three
reasons:
first
of
all,
sandstrom
was
designed
to
eliminate
the
use
of
jury
instructions
which
created
a
substantial
danger
that
the
jury
would
either
conclusively
presume
or
presume,
absent
proof
to
the
contrary,
the
element
of
intent,
eliminating
the
prosecution's
burden
of
proof
which
you
have
characterized
in
past
cases
as
one
of
the
most
fundamental
safeguards
we
have
against
erroneous
factual
convictions.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
yes;
against
erroneous
factual
error.
in
addition
to
that,
your
past
decisions
clearly
forshadowed
sandstrom.
in
morissette
v.
united
states,
over
30
years
ago,
you
condemned
this
kind
of
an
instruction.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
you're
correct.
but
then,
the
reason
you
said
that
in
morissette
was
because
such
conclusive
presumptions
or
burden-shifting
presumptions
violate
the
presumption
of
innocence.
in
1970,
in
in
re
winship,
you
said
we
have
to
apply
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
order
to
provide
concrete
substance
to
the
presumption
of
innocence.
together,
winship
and
morissette,
winship,
of
course,
was
a
state
case,
applying
this
to
the
states.
together,
those
cases
gave
clear
warning
that
these
instructions
could
not
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
we
don't
have
to
go
any
further.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
the
state
has
not
raised
the
argument
that
a
different
standard
should
apply
to
collateral
attack
cases.
the
said--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
my
main
position;
yes.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
would
think
it
would.
but
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
impact
of
whatever
you
decide
in
this
case
on
retroactivity
is
not
going
to
be
very
great.
five
years
have
passed
since
sandstrom
was
decided.
during
that
time,
defendants
have
been
actively
litigating
this
issue
on
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
and
most
of
those
cases
have
been
finally
resolved,
one
way
or
the
other.
all
we're
really
dealing
with
here
are
the
stragglers.
this
isn't
a
case--
mr.
john
nussbaumer
--i
don't
think
it's
untoward,
given
the
fact
that
morissette
and
winship
and
approximately
a
half
a
dozen
circuit
court
of
appeals
decisions
decided
in
the
'50s
and
'60s,
struck
down
these
kinds
of
instructions,
said
they'd
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
think,
even
if
it
isn't,
i
think
you're
really
only
dealing
with
the
stragglers
here.
mr.
john
nussbaumer
i
wanted
to
make
one
final
point
with
regard
to
the
harmless
error
issue.
if
intent
was
such
an
inconsequential
and
peripheral
part
of
this
case,
and
if
these
instructions
were
so
minor
and
had
no
role
in
the
case,
why,
then,
did
the
trial
court
go
to
the
lengths
it
did
to
inundate
this
jury
with
all
of
these
presumptions,
all
relating
to
the
question
of
intent?
and,
equally
important,
why
did
the
trial
prosecutor
repeatedly
urge
the
jury,
throughout
his
closing
argument,
on
no
less
than
three
occasions,
to
rely
on
mr.
engle's
acts
in
determining
his
intent,
using
language
virtually
identical
to
the
natural
consequences
presumption
that
the
court
would
ultimately
use
in
its
instructions?
i
submit
that
the
answer
is
that
both
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
prosecutor
knew
that
the
question
of
intent
in
this
case
was
a
hotly-disputed
matter,
an
issue
on
which
the
jury
could
go
either
way,
and
they
both
wanted
to
make
sure
that,
in
resolving
the
factual
dispute
before
them,
these
jurors
applied
these
presumptions.
even
under
a
traditional
chapman
v.
california
harmless
error
analysis,
i
don't
think
the
state
can
carry
its
burden
that
these
instructions
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
obtained.
i
encourage
you
to
read
these
instructions.
you'll
find
that
they
stacked
the
deck
against
this
defendant
to
such
an
extent
that
there
was
no
way
that
the
jury
could
fairly
or
constitutionally
consider
the
evidence,
the
conflicting
evidence
of
intent
that
the
defense
had
presented.
thank
you
very
much.
