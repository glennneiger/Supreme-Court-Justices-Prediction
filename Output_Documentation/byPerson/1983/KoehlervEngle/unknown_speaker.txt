unknown
speaker
mr.
caruso,
didn't
the
sixth
circuit
disagree
with
you
on
that
point
and
say--
unknown
speaker
--solicitor
general,
may
i
ask
a
question,
because
maybe
i
missed
something
you
said.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that,
in
people
against
wright,
the
michigan
supreme
court
held
that
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
does
not
apply
to
sandstrom
instructions,
as
i
read
it.
i
haven't
read
the
wright
case
myself.
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
say
that
they
would
review
sandstrom
error,
even
if
there
was
no
contemporaneous
objection?
unknown
speaker
but
that's,
apparently,
what
the
sixth
circuit
thought
they
said?
unknown
speaker
mr.
caruso,
normally
we
don't
reexamine
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
what
the
state
law
is.
do
you
plan
to
discuss
the
other
arguments
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
state
supreme
court
makes
what
we
consider
an
erroneous
instruction
of
its
own
law
or
statute
that
doesn't
involve
the
constitution,
we
certainly
don't
review
it.
if
the
court
of
appeals
makes
what,
in
our
view,
is
an
error
in
construing
a
state
supreme
court
opinion,
that's
open
to
review
here,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
caruso,
what
are
these...
which
of
the
points
you
want
to
raise
are
these
facts
being
urged
in
support
of?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
could
i
interpret
you
for
a
rather
important
problem
that
bothers
me,
if
i
may?
there
are
three
questions
in
this
case.
you've
argued
the
wainwright
against
sykes,
and
now
you're
arguing
whether
there
was
an
sandstrom
error.
but
your
first
question
that
you
presented
and
discussed
in
your
opening
brief
was
whether
sandstrom
was
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
and
your
opponents
say,
in
their...
page
7
of
their
brief...
that
you
did
not
argue
that
question
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
don't
find
that
you
filed
a
reply
brief.
are
you
agreeing
you
did
not
raise
that
question?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
why
you're
not
arguing
the
retroactivity
clause.
unknown
speaker
mr.
caruso,
the
conviction
here
was
first
degree
murder,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
were
the
instructions
on
first
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
then
how
does
a
good
bit
of
the
argument
in
this
case
from
both
sides
really
bear
on
that,
when
the
jury
came
in
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
first
degree
murder?
it
would
bear
on
second
degree
and
the
other
lesser
defenses,
would
it
not?
but
does
it
bear
on
first
degree
murder?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
make
the
argument,
and
i
wonder
why
you
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
instructions
on
first
degree
murder
were
very
specific
as
to
premeditation
and
intent.
unknown
speaker
and
that
sandstrom
error,
when
existent,
hardly
bears
on
the
instructions
on
first
degree
murder
and
the
resulting
conviction
on
first
degree
murder.
unknown
speaker
let
me
read
from
the
instructions
on
first
degree
murder:
"it
must
appear
that
the
killing
was
willful
and
premeditated.
"
unknown
speaker
and
the
jury
bought
that.
unknown
speaker
then
i
wonder
why
we're
so
concerned
about
sandstrom
error.
unknown
speaker
you
referred
earlier
to
some
of
his
statements,
that
he
had
stopped
shooting
because
he
didn't
want
to
kill
anybody
except
this
one
man.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
was
before...
those
were
pretrial
statements.
unknown
speaker
they
were
before
the
jury,
when
they
received
the
instruction
that
justice
blackmum
just
referred
to.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
summarize
what
i've
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
verdict
itself
is
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
intent
instruction
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
could
not.
with
a
first
degree
murder
verdict.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
on
that
question...
the
instructions
that
are
quoted
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
at
17a,
the
long
instruction,
are
those
instructions
on
the
first
degree
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
long
quotation,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
from
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
those
instructions
concern
the
first
degree
murder
charge?
one,
he's
describing
malice
in
a
technical
sense,
and
it
says:
"malice
is
implied
from
any
deliberate
and
cruel
act
against
another
person,
however
sudden.
"
and,
later
on:
"the
law
gives
us
a
rule
of
thumb
that
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
act.
"
did
that
pertain
to
the
first
degree
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
how
can
you
be
so
confident
that
those
instructions
had
no
impact
on
the
jury's
deliberations
on
the
first
degree
murder
charge?
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
instructions
did
affect
their
deliberations.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
basis
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
he
dispute
the
statement
that
he
made
to
the
policeman
that
came
into
the
record
through
the
policeman's
testimony,
about
having
stopped
shooting
because
he
wanted
to
be
sure
not
to
hit
anybody
else
except
the
man
he
was
trying
to
kill?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
wright
case?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
actual
question
here,
i
suppose
is,
whether
in
those
three
petitions
for
delayed
appeal,
the
michigan
appellant
court,
in
this
particular
respondent's
case,
did
or
did
not
enforce
a
default
rule.
unknown
speaker
what
happened
on
these
appeals?
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
interrupt
you?
do
you
concede,
then,
that
sandstrom
error
is
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule?
unknown
speaker
so
the
error
in
this
case,
you
agree,
was
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway,
whatever
it
was,
you
agree
it
was--
unknown
speaker
--the
intent.
intent.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
intent
was
in
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
it
was
not
harmless
error.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
counsel
for
the
state,
that
he
did
not
dispute
the
statements
made
at
the
time
that
he
stopped
shooting,
because
he
wanted
to
be
sure
not
to
hit
anyone
else
except
this
particular
man?
unknown
speaker
there
was
evidence
that
he
did
stop
shooting
for
a
period
that
was
consistent
to
the
statement
attributed
to
him,
was
there
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
nussbaumer,
you
doubtless
recall
that
sandstrom
against
montana
and
connecticut
against
johnson
were
cases
here
on
direct
review,
involving
the
kind
of
instructions
that
are
being
contested
here.
this
case
appears,
of
course,
on
federal
habeas.
now,
do
you
think
that
a
federal
habeas
court
is
as
free
as
this
court
would
be
on
direct
review
of
a
state
conviction,
where
the
same
challenge
is
made,
to
pick
out
a
couple
sentences
in
instructions
that
here
seem
to
have
taken
about
16
pages,
and
say
there
was
an
impermissible
instruction,
so
a
conviction
that's
13
years
is...
or
11
years
old...
can
be
set
aside?
i
ask
that
because
of
our
decision
in
cupp
against
naughten.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question
about
the
standard
of
review
on
habeas?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
something
unconstitutional
about
requiring
a
defendant
to
bear
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
evidence
about
insanity?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
state
requires,
the
charge
by
a
michigan
judge
in
this
particular
case,
affirmed
by
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
at
least
have
the
view
of
the
michigan
trial
judge
that
this
was
michigan
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
does
it
amount
to
much
more
than
state
law
grounds
here?
unknown
speaker
now,
these
matters
were
all
before
the
jury,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
they've
been
resolved
by
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
in
what
year
was
this
killing
committed?
unknown
speaker
'72?
unknown
speaker
the
state's
psychiatrist
did
not
concede
all
of
what
the
defense
psychiatrist
said.
unknown
speaker
but
merely,
that
if
what
she
said
was
true--
unknown
speaker
--then
he
was
really
just
talking
about
a
generalization
of
psychiatry,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask...
i
would
suppose
you
would
agree
that
we
are
not
foreclosed
from
considering
the
retroactivity
issue
in
this
case.
this
is
from
a
federal
court;
it
may
not
have
been
raised
below,
but
we
have
not
infrequently
considered
issues
that
aren't
raised
by...
weren't
presented
to
a
court
below.
unknown
speaker
and
what
of...
let's
just
assume
that
it
was
as
clear
as
could
be
that,
under
our
precedents,
old
or
new,
that
a
decision
like
this
should
not
be
retroactive?
i
suppose
we
would
certainly
deal
with
the
retroactivity
issue,
wouldn't
we,
even
if
it
weren't
raised
below?
unknown
speaker
that
may
be.
but
was
it
absolutely
clear
in
that
case
that
the
position
that
was
being
urged
was
clear
under
our
cases?
unknown
speaker
my
only
suggestion
is,
are
you
going
to
say
anything
about
retroactivity?
unknown
speaker
i
would
appreciate,
just
in
a
word,
why
you
think
sandstrom
is
retroactive
in
a
case
like
this.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
protection
against
risk
of...
against
error,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
for
federal
courts
construing
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
right
on
your
first
argument--
unknown
speaker
--if
you're
right
in
your
first
argument,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
our...
at
least,
arguably,
under
our
cases,
if
the
new
rule
is
designed
sufficiently
related
to
the
accuracy
of
verdicts,
it's
retroactive
in
any
case.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it,
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
depends
on...
if
there
were
a
rule,
for
example,
that
sandstrom
error
is
never
subject
to
the
harmless
error
analysis,
a
fortiori,
sandstrom
would
be
retroactive
everywhere.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
be
quite
a
few,
and
if
sandstrom
isn't
retroactive,
it
seems
untoward
for
us
to
set
aside,
based
on
sandstrom,
a
conviction
that's
13
years
old.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
that's
just
an
argument
that
sandstrom
should
be
retroactive.
unknown
speaker
and
i
just
assumed
that
if...
what
if
it
wasn't?
what
if
it
isn't?
unknown
speaker
that's
too
many.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
solicitor
general?
