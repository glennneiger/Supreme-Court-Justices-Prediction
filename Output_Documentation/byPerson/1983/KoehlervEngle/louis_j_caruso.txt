mr.
louis
j.
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
a
collateral
attack
on
state
courts'
proceedings
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
review
in
federal
district
court.
it
concerns
a
claimed
erroneous
jury
instruction
that
was
given
on
presumed
intent,
in
connection
with
a
murder
trial
of
respondent
engle,
which
culminated
in
a
guilty
verdict
of
first
degree
murder
in
july
of
1973.
the
federal
district
court
concluded
that
the
claimed
infirm
instruction
is
not
constitutionally
infirm.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
disagreed
and
reversed.
collateral
attack
here
is
precluded
by
the
failure
of
respondent
engle
to
make
timely
objection
to
the
claimed
infirm
instruction.
michigan
has
a
contemporaneous
objection
requirement.
it
is
embodied
in
statute
and
in
court
rule.
the
rule
contains,
however,
an
escape
provision:
"and
the
court
will
review
error,
without
objection.
"
to
prevent
what
it
calls
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
respondent,
here,
mistakenly
asserts
that
there's
a
broad
per
se
exception
to
that
contemporaneous
rule,
objection
rule,
in
that
it
does
not
apply
to
the
instructions
given
on
elements
of
crime.
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
respondent
support
that
proposition.
what
the
court
does
in
those
cases
is
actually
apply
the
rule
and
make
an
assessment
as
to
the
likelihood
of
the
potential
for
miscarriage
of
justice.
and
where
the
merits
have
been
analyzed
by
the
court
in
those
cases
when
the
objection
has
not
been
made
has
been
because
it
has
been
suspected
that
there
is
the
potential
for
miscarriage
of
justice.
it
is
not
because
the
rule
is
not
applied.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
state
of
michigan
does
not
apply
its
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
but
it
does
apply
it.
and
people
v.
wright
and
people
v.
perez,
two
cases
of
current
vintage,
although
timely
objections
were
not
made
in
those
two
cases
on
presumed
intent
instructions,
the
court
took
the
opportunity
in
those
cases
to
direct
the
trial
court
to
stop
making
those
sort
of
presumed
instructions.
but,
nevertheless,
in
those
cases,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
existence
of
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
and
recognized
its
liability.
in
the
one
case,
in
people
v.
wright,
it
found
harmless
error;
and,
in
the
other
case
it
found
the
error
was
harmless;
but,
nevertheless,
as
the
court
indicated,
quoting
the
rule,
it
is
still
the
law
in
michigan.
here,
there
is
no
objection
made
at
the
trial
stage
to
the
claimed
infirm
instruction.
the
direct
appeal
that
was
taken
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
as
of
wright
challenged
only
the
intoxication
instruction.
the
judgement
of
conviction
became
final
in
1975
when
that
direct
appeal
ended.
there
was
no
timely
application
made
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
the
first
time
the
objection
to
the
intent,
presumed
intent
instruction,
came
out
on
three
applications
for
delayed
appeal,
two
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
one
application
for
delayed
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
when
those
applications
were
filed,
the
prosecuting
attorney
raised
the
absence
of
compliance
by
the
respondent
was
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
as
well
as
making
a
response
to
the
merits
of
the
claims.
now,
the
court...
all
three
of
these
applications
for
delayed
appeal,
were
denied
by
the
courts.
they
were
denied
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
merits
on
grounds
presented,
and
the
court
is
not
persuaded
that
the
question
presented
should
be
reviewed.
now,
although
the
michigan
constitution
does
require
that
the
appellate
court,
in
denying
leave
to
appeal
in
a
matter,
should
give
the
grounds
for
the
denial,
a
denial,
the
court
says,
is
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
and,
thus,
in
order
for
respondent
engle
to
have
had
his
federal
claim
decided,
it
would
have
been
necessary,
in
each
one
of
those
discretionary
appeals,
to
have
had
the
review
on
the
merits
by
a
grant
of
leave.
so
we're
taking
the
position
here,
insofar
as
michigan
law
is
concerned,
and
we
seek
the
application
of
the
sykes
rule
when
there
is
a
denial
order...
and
michigan
has...
has
in
michigan...
they
have
a
contemporaneous
objection
rule;
the
defendant
has
not
complied
with
it,
and
the
prosecutor
has
argued
the
rule
in
response
to
the
application
for
leave
to
appeal,
and
there
is
no
decision
on
the
merits
because
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
this
to
the
bar
in
michigan:
then,
a
habeas
court
must
assume
that
the
state
followed
its
contemporaneous
objection
rule.
this
would
be
consistent
with
the
general
rule
that,
in
habeas
cases,
the
state
court
decision
is
presumed
correct,
absent
a
contrary
showing,
overwhelming
contrary
showing
by
the
prisoner.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
in
the
wright
case,
the
court
applied
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
and
made
a
decision
that
it
should
review
this
sort
of
an
error,
claimed
error,
simply
because
there's
the
likelihood
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
but
the
thing
of
it
is,
the
court
also
has
supervisory
authority
over
all
litigation
in
state
courts
in
michigan.
and
they
made
it
very
clear;
the
reason
that
they
took
these
cases
was
to
seize
upon
the
opportunity,
in
these
two
consolidated
cases,
to
announce
the
prophylactic
rule
of
sandstrom,
and
directed
the
lower
courts
to
stop
using
those
kinds
of
instructions.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
recall
their
saying
that
conclusively;
no.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
sixth
circuit
apparently
thought
that;
yes.
this
position,
i
would
say,
promotes
comedy.
and,
as
in
the
showing
by
the
respondent/appellant...
and
there
certainly
has
been
no
showing
of
cause
and
actual
prejudice,
actual
prejudice
at
the
level
shown
in
u.s.
v.
brady,
for
example.
here,
the
claimed
instructional
error
does
not
contravene
the
decision
of
sandstrom.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
but,
insofar
as
the
state
law
is
concerned,
i
say
that
it
has...
the
state
of
michigan
does
have
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement,
and
it
is
an
independent
state
ground.
and
this
is
what
was
held
in
wainwright
v.
sykes;
it's
what
was
held
in
several
other
cases.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
would
say
so,
yes,
chief
justice.
and
i
think
that
if
that
is
the
conclusion
that
they
came
to...
and
it
is...
that
the
state
of
michigan
does
not
apply
contemporaneous
objection
rule,
that
that
is
erroneous,
and
that's
contrary.
but
the
federal
district
court
agreed
that
the
error
that
is
claimed
for
by
respondent/appellant
did
not
violate
the
sanstrom
rule,
and
they
didn't
even
bother
to
make
a
harmless
error
analysis.
engle
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
in
july
of
1973,
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
of
his
foreman
at
the
chrysler
auto
plant
in
detroit.
believing
him
to
have
been
responsible
for
having
been
laid
off
december
4,
1972,
december
7,
1972,
at
9:00
p.m.,
engle
entered
the
auto
plant,
told
his
nephew
he
was
going
to
kill
a
guy.
engle
entered
the
foreman
lantzy's
office,
encountered
a
clerk,
and
asked
him
as
to
where
the...
the
whereabouts
of
foreman
lantzy.
he
said
he
was
temporarily
out,
and
offered
to
go
find
him.
engle
said
that,
never
mind,
that
he
would
go
find
him.
at
9:45
p.m.,
two
employees
saw
engle
talking
to
lantzy
and
then
saw
him
shoot
lantzy,
who
ran.
he
was
shot
twice
more,
and
he
fell.
he
stood
over
him,
and
then
walked
away
and
returned
to
the
office
of
lantzy
and
told
the
clerk
that
he
had
shot
and
killed
lantzy.
when
the
security
guard
arrived,
he
gave
the
gun
to
his
security
guard,
and
said
that
he
had
killed
lantzy.
the
police
arrived,
and
engle
described
the
shooting
in
detail,
and
said
that
he
had
ceased
firing
because
he
didn't
want
to
hurt
anyone
else.
the
next
day,
he
gave
the
same
version
to
the
police
officers
in
writing.
now,
the
respondent--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--these
facts
are
being
urged
in
support
of
the
fact
that
if
this
is
error,
it's
harmless
error,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
respondent
at
trial
testified
that
he
did
not
remember
the
incident.
what
he
did
do
was
interpose
a
defense
of
insanity,
the
irresistible
impulse
prong
of
the
michigan
insanity
defense.
now,
in
sandstrom,
the
court
instructed,
the
law
presumes
that
a
person
intends
the
natural
consequences
of
his
voluntary
acts.
that
instruction
was
given,
and
the
court
said
a
juror
may
have
interpreted
these
words
as
a
conclusive
presumption,
one
overriding
the
presumption
of
innocence,
and
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
defendant.
now,
here,
in
the
engle
case,
the
subject
instruction
is
not
couched
in
mandatory
terms;
it
is
not
a
mandated
presumption
that
would
in
any
way
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
what
is
does
suggest
is
a
reasoning
process
to
the
jury
commenting
on
the
relevant
evidence.
and
you'll
see,
at
page
13a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
wording
that
was
used
by
the
judge
in
instructing
the
jury:
we,
of
course,
do
not
have
the
power
to
look
into
a
person's
mind
to
tell
what
the
person
is
thinking
of
at
any
particular
time,
but
the
law
gives
a
rule
of
thumb
that
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
acts.
then
it
goes
on
to
say:
therefore,
in
determining
whether
there
was
an
intent
to
kill,
you
may
properly
consider
that
a
gun
was
used.
you
may
properly
consider
the
wounds,
where
the
gun
was
held
in
relation
to
the
body,
and
i
think
it
is
proper
that
you
may
consider
all
these
things
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
war
an
intent
to
kill.
however,
the
court
did
admonish
the
jury--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
is
correct.
we
did
not
raise
that
question.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
we
did
not.
therefore,
the
court
then
went
on
to
admonish
the
jury
that
they
had
to
be
satisfied
with
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
addition
to
that
presumed
intent
instruction,
the
court
did
tell
the
jury
and
instruct
the
jury
on
the
six
elements
of
homicide.
and
in
instructing
the
jury
on
the
six
elements
of
homicide
it
told
the
jury
that
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
each
one
of
these
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then
had
to
also
prove
malice.
now,
instructions
are
only
a
component
part
of
the
entire
trial.
it
is
given,
usually,
in
the
main,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
and
presentation
of
exhibits.
but
for
that
reason,
it's
necessary
to
review
the
instruction
in
light
of
the
entire
record,
to
determine
the
impact
that
a
particular
instruction
does
have
on
the
outcome.
and
it's
our
contention
that
this
presumed
instruction
that
is
claimed
to
be
infirm
did
not
have
any
adverse
impact
on
the
outcome
here,
although
intent
was
technically
in
dispute
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
it
was
actually
subsidiary
to
the
claim
of
insanity,
which
was
the
focal
point
of
the
trial.
the
proofs
took
up
entirely,
almost
entirely,
the
time
of
the
jury
with
proofs
on
insanity.
they
did
not
dispute
the
general
intent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
prosecuting
attorney
on
cross
examination
of
the
defendant
engle,
at
the
transcript
at
volume
iii,
page
314:
"you
don't
know...
you're
telling
this
jury
that
you
don't
know
who
killed
regis
lantzy?
"
"is
that
correct?
"
"no,
that's
too
much.
"
"too
many
witnesses
said
that
i
did
it.
"
"i'm
not
denying
doing
it.
"
"i'm
not
even
trying
to
justify
doing
it.
"
"i'm
just
telling
you
i
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing
it
when
i
did
it.
"
"i
don't
remember
doing
it.
"
"i'm
not
trying
to
justify
me.
"
"there
isn't
any
justification
for
the
taking
another
man's
life,
unless
it's
in
self
defense.
"
now,
this
is
the
tone
that
the
evidence
took
in
this
entire
trial.
now,
with
respect
to
the
insanity
defense,
the
insanity
instruction,
that
left
no
doubt
that
the
jury
was
fully
apprised
as
to
its
fact-finding
function
and
the
prosecution's
burden.
in
that
particular
instruction,
the
court
said
the
presumption
of
insanity
is
a
legal
presumption
merely.
it
lasts
only
until
some
evidence
is
introduced.
that
merely
states
the
michigan
law
that
insanity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
you
have
to
raise
it,
but
you
don't
have
to
put
any
great
body
of
proofs.
it's
simply,
merely
a
burden
of
production.
and
once
that
is
put
in,
then
the
prosecutor
has
the
burden
of
proving
sanity.
and
the
court
actually
did
instruct
the
jury,
in
the
words
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proving
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
that
statement
is
contained
in
the
insanity
instruction.
accordingly,
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
jury's
duty
in
the
fact-finding
function,
and
also
in
view
of
that
language,
it
cannot
be
argued,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
jury
was
misled
by
these
instructions
in
believing
that
the
instruction
given
was...
had
the
effect
of
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
prosecutor
to
the
defendant.
and
that
simply
did
not
happen.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
on
first
degree
murder,
the
instructions
read
that
there
had
to
be
a
proof
of
specific
intent
to
kill,
and
premeditation.
and
that
instruction
was
given.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
instruction
bear...
the
verdict?
i
don't...
i
didn't
follow
that.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
is
right.
and
the
instruction
was
given;
it
was
very
clearly
given.
and
the
instructions
that
were
given
with
respect
to
malice
and
the
various
components
of
second
degree
murder
was
also
very
clearly
given,
and--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--yes;
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
jury
was
convinced
that
it
was.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
believe
we
should
be
concerned
about
sandstrom
error,
because
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
the
instruction
that
was
given
does
not...
would
not,
in
any
way,
indicate
to
the
jury
that
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
elements
of
first
degree
murder...
premeditation,
intent
to
kill,
malice...
was
in
any
way
led
to
believe
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
have
that
burden
of
proof.
he
very
clear
had
the
burden.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
that
testimony
was
given
to
the
jury
in
the
form
of
testimony
from
the
police
officers
and
from...
yes,
the
police
officer
gave
that
testimony.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
intent
instruction
given
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
intent
instruction,
the
presumed
intent
instruction.
the
fact
is
that
the
claimed
error
did
not
have
any
impact
on
the
decision
of
the
jury
in
first
degree
murder.
they
were
satisfied
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
apparently,
to
come
to...
to
render
a
verdict
of
first
degree
murder.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
didn't
hear
you.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
pertained
to
the
first
degree
murder
charge,
as
well
as
to
the
second
degree
murder
charge.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
description
that
was
given
in
defining
malice,
and
the...
certainly,
the
instruction
that
was
given
on
malice
is
defined
in
another
way
as
the
intentional
killing
of
another
person.
that's
specific
intent
to
kill.
yes;
that
definitely
had
an
impact
on
the
decision
of
the
jury.
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
that
one
statement
in
the
instruction,
that
"the
law
gives
us
a
rule
of
thumb
that
a
person
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
acts.
"
did
not
influence
the
jury.
in
other
words,
the
jury
was
not
led
by
this
statement
in
this
instruction
as
calling
for
a
presumption
of
guilt,
a
finding
of
intent:
nor
did
it
shift
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
prosecutor
to
the
defendant.
this
is
what
i'm
arguing.
this
is
the
instruction
i
say
did
not
impact
or
affect
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
jury.
but
the
rest
of
these
instructions--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--did
affect...
yes.
yes.
my
reference
is
to
the
part
of
the
instruction
that
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
decision...
is
the
instruction
on
presumed
intent,
the
natural
consequences
of
his
act.
and
that's
what
sandstrom
says
is
in
infirm.
but,
at
the
same
time,
there's
a
host
of
cases
that
say
you
consider
these
instructions
in
relation
to
all
of
the
other
instructions
contextually.
and
not
only
the
words
do
you
consider
and
the
instruction
in
context
of
the
others,
you
must
consider
that
instruction
in
light
of
the
evidence
and
the
proofs
at
trial
to
determine
if
that
claimed
erroneous
instruction
had
an
impact
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that's
right.
and
the
very
issue,
the
issue
that
is
being
made
here,
is
in
that
particular
instruction
about
presumed
intent.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
language
in
that
presumed
intent
instruction
did
not
have
any
bearing,
any
outcome,
on
the
decision,
on
the
finding
of
guilt
by
the
jury,
because
there
was
enough
contained
in
the
rest
of
the
instructions
to
indicate
the
prosecutor
had
to
prove
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime;
had
to
prove
specific
intent,
had
to
prove
malice,
had
to
prove
premeditation.
and
all
of
these
proofs
of
the
element
of
crime
were
not
disputed
by
the
defendant
here.
the
defendant
admitted
having
shot
the
person,
in
a
sense.
he
does
not
admit
that
he
intended...
he
merely
says
"i
don't
remember
having
done
it.
"
the
testimony
of
witnesses
saw
him
come
in,
saw
him
shoot
regis
lantzy.
but
these
are
all
proofs
that
go
to
the
intent.
none
of
these
were
disputed
by
the
defendant
in
this
case.
so,
considering
the
words
that
we
find
in
this
particular
instruction
that
is
claimed
to
be
infirm,
related
against
the
whole
body
of
the
proofs
in
this
case,
i
would
say
it
just
pales
to
insignificance.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
believe
that
was
disputed.
the
only
they
say,
that
he
just
doesn't
remember
what
he
did.
and
the
arguments
made
by
counsel,
by
the
defendant
during
the
course
of
the
trial
itself,
the
counsel
argued
and
admitted
that
what
engle
represented...
that
lantzy
represented
to
engle
some
terrible
thing
that
happened
in
his
life,
and
he
wanted
to
do
away
with
him;
in
other
words,
the
irresistible
impulse
defense.
and
that's
what
the
whole
defense
was
on...
the
irresistible
impulse
and
insanity
plea.
and
they
did
not
really
attack
the
proofs,
and
they
were
not
challenged
specifically.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
advise
the
court
that,
although
i
didn't
comment
on
the
retroactive
argument,
we
have
not
abandoned
that.
we
simply
rely
on
what's
been
contained
in
the
brief.
and,
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
would
agree
with
counsel
that
rules
of
law
should
be
made
retroactive
if
they
are
sufficiently
related
to
the
accuracy
of
the
verdicts.
in
this
situation
with
sandstrom,
we
characterize
sandstrom
as
more
or
less
a
prophylactic
rule
to
protect
against
the
possibility
of
a
juror
being
misled
by
an
instruction.
it
cannot
be
said
that,
in
all
cases
heretofore,
that
sandstrom
affected
the
accuracy
of
a
verdict,
because
in
many
of
these
cases,
they
were
certainly
not
closed
questions.
now,
with
respect
to
the
intoxication
instructions,
the
intoxication
instruction
that
was
given
was
valid
under
michigan
law
at
the
time
it
was
given,
and
it
was
a
capacity
test
instruction.
in
other
words,
the
court
said,
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
was
so
intoxicated
that
he
was
unable
to
form
an
intent,
then
you
must
find
him
not
guilty.
but
the
fact
of
it
is
that
it
didn't
concern
a
finding
of
intent
as
such.
the
only
thing
is
that
they
found,
if
he
was
incapacitated
to
that
extent,
then
he
couldn't
be
guilty
of
the
crime;
but,
nevertheless,
the
jury
found
that
he
was
not
intoxicated
to
the
extent
that
he
lacked
capacity.
now,
with
respect
to
the
insanity
testimony,
there
was
testimony,
not
only
from
lay
witnesses,
there
was
testimony
also
from
state
psychiatrist.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony;
it
was
in
conflict.
and
the
jury
finally
agreed
to
believe
the
testimony
of
the
state
witnesses,
particularly
i
call
your
attention
again
to
that
instruction
that
was
given
on
insanity,
and
that
is,
that
the
court
reminded,
in
so
many
terms,
that
the
prosecution,
the
state,
had
the
burden
of
proving
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
we
presume
now...
it's
quite
evident,
at
least
to
me,
that
the
jury
did
believe
that
the
prosecution
had
proved
sanity
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
question,
the
matter
of
the
defense
of
insanity
itself,
does
not
relate
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
that's
separate
and
apart.
it
doesn't
relate
to
intent.
it
is
almost
in
the
nature
of
an
affirmative
defense.
you
can
still
have
intent
to
kill
and
he
insane
or
be
suffering
from
mental
disease.
and
that
does
not
negate,
in
and
of
itself,
the
intent.
