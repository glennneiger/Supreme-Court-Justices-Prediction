mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
indicated
by
the
petitioner
the
state
in
this
case
relies
on
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
which
established
the
reasonableness
of
a
warrantless
entry
under
that
doctrine
the
warrantless
entry
to
arrest
or
to
search
that
he
made
if
the
police
possessed
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
in
this
case
the
primary
exigent
circumstances
relied
upon
by
the
state
is
the
need
to
obtain
evidence
before
it
is
lost.
the
police
were
after
mr.
welsh
to
arrest
him
for
drunk
driving
and
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
schmerber
in
a
case
for
drunk
driving
or
intoxication
offense
the
evidence
will
dissipate
gradually
in
the
blood
and
over
a
period
of
time
will
disappear.
therefore,
there
was
a
need
to
immediately
enter
the
home
in
order
to
obtain
the
evidence
as
soon
as
possible.
a
delay
that
may
have
been
occasioned
by
obtaining
a
warrant
during
a
delay
even
if
not
all
evidence
of
intoxication
would
have
been
lost
there
would
have
been
a
period
of
some
dissipation
of
the
alcohol.
it
is
just
unknown
how
much
would
have
been
lost.
it
is
also
important
because
there
is
no
way
until
the
police
have
contacted
the
suspect
for
them
to
know
when
he
stopped
drinking
so
he
may
have
already
stopped
several
hours
before,
still
be
intoxicated
and
by
the
time
they
get
a
warrant
no
longer
be
intoxicated.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
is
what
i
understand.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
do
not
know
what
happened
or
what
the
judgment
was.
the
case
as
i
understand
it
is
on
appeal
and
that
case
is
pending
in
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
waiting
the
outcome
of
this
because
he
is
also
challenging
the
arrest
in
that
case.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
assume
that
any
penalty
imposed
in
that
case
would
have
been
stayed
pending
the
appeal,
but
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
do
not
know
what
evidence
was
used.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
i
think
evidence
of
a
breathalyzer
or
a
blood
test
would
have
been
a
much
better
and
much
stronger
case
obviously
than
the
evidence
from
mr.
jablonic
who
observed
him
only
for
a
couple
minutes.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
yes.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--as
the
first
argument
pointed
out
there
is
some
discrepancy
as
to
what
mr.
jablonic
saw.
he
said
one
thing.
the
police
officer
said
that
he
recalled
something
else.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
at
this
hearing...
well--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--yes,
he
did
testify.
what
happened
was
in
the
drunk
driving
case
itself
there
was
a
suppression
hearing
challenging
the
arrest.
mr.
jablonic
testified.
officer
daley
testified.
mrs.
welsh
testified.
then
in
the
separate
proceeding
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
the
refusal
there
was
a
question
raised
as
to
the
arrest.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
is
this
proceeding
now.
all
the
parties
and
the
court
relied
on
the
transcript
and
the
findings
from
the
drunk
driving
case
to
rule
on
the
legality
of
the
arrest
for
purposes
of
the
reasonableness
hearing.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
in
this
proceeding
where
it
is
to
revoke
his
license
the
police
officer
is
not
entitled
to
order
him
or
request
a
breathalyzer
unless
he
has
first
legally
arrested
him.
so
i
think
there
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
wisconsin
courts
have
taken
a
position
that
the
legality
of
the
arrest
depends
not
only
on
satisfying
wisconsin
arrest
statutes
but
on
satisfying
fourth
amendment
requirements.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
take
the
other
position--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--i
do
not
believe
so.
i
think
the
other
one
is
that
they
incorporated
the
fourth
amendment
as
one
of
their
criteria
in
determining
the
legality
of
the
arrest.
on
the
exigent
circumstances
i
think
another
reason
that--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--yes.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
think
that
would
indicate
that
at
least
mr.
jablonic
was
concerned
that
this
person
was
quite
intoxicated
and
that
if
he
had
returned
to
his
car,
stayed
in
his
car
and
tried
to
drive
it
some
more
and
gone
back
on
the
highway
that
in
his
condition
there
may
have
been
an
accident
especially
since
mr.
jablonic
said
he
had
seen
the
petitioner
go
down
the
wrong
lane,
the
left
lane,
and
coming
head
on
towards
another
car
and
at
that
point
was
able
to
veer
off
the
left
before
an
accident.
but
i
am
sure
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
continued
to
drive
he
may
not
be
so
lucky
the
next
time
which
would
indicate
that
they
wanted
to
or
at
least
mr.
jablonic
was
concerned
that
something
be
done
about
his
condition
as
soon
as
possible.
at
this
point
i
cannot
recall
that
mr.
jablonic
expressed
that
same
fear
to
the
police
officer
at
the
time,
however.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
was
mr.
jablonic's
testimony,
yes.
i
believe
that
is
why
he
stopped
his
car
to
block
the
path
of
mr.
welsh
if
he
had
tried
to
get
his
car
out
of
this
lot.
but
primarily--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--well,
mr.
welsh's...
yes,
in
that
his
license
could
be
suspended
either
through
the
reasonableness
hearing
for
refusing
the
breathalyzer
or
as
a
result
of
his
conviction
for
drunk
driving.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
in
this
proceeding
here,
yes.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
yes,
because--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--well,
the
trial
judges
accepted
that
and
the
officer
is
not
entitled
to
even
request
him
to
take
a
breathalyzer
until
he
has
arrested
him
in
a
valid
arrest
so
that
is
a
requirement
before
even
asking
for
the
breathalyzer.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
no,
mr.
jablonic
had
stopped
his
car
to
block
mr.
welsh
from
moving
his.
another
motorist
stopped
and
mr.
jablonic
asked
that
motorist
to
call
the
police.
presumably
that
person
called
the
police
because
the
police
did
receive
a
call.
a
policeman
responded
to
the
call
and
went
to
talk
first
to
mr.
jablonic
who
then
related
some
information
to
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
at
that
point
also
checked
the
license
plate
on
the
car
to
obtain
some
identification
of
the
driver
and
at
that
point
went
to
the
address
listed
to
that
person.
so
before
he
had
gotten
to
he
house
he
had
talked
to
mr.
jablonic.
this
court
in
another
drunk
driving
case
in
a
context
of
different
issue
has
again
recognized
the
need
for
obtaining
evidence
of
intoxication
as
soon
as
possible.
in
the
mackey
v.
montrym
case
the
court
said
then
in
order
for
the
state
to
protect
people
from
drunk
drivers
the
state
has
to
have
the
authority
to
obtain
a
breathalyzer
test
for
evidence
of
intoxication
at
the
earliest
possible
moment.
again,
that
is
simply
what
this
officer
said
he
was
trying
to
do.
that
is
why
he
went
to
the
house
and
did
not
try
to
get
a
warrant.
i
think
the
exigent
circumstances
prong
of
this
to
get
into
a
house
has
been
satisfied
with
a
need
to
obtain
this
evidence.
the
other
prong
is
probable
cause
which
in
this
case
the
petitioner
says
is
not
a
problem.
so
under
those
two
tests
it
would
appear
that
the
police
were
justified
in
going
in
the
house.
however,
as
i
understand
petitioner's
objection
now
is
that
we
cannot
apply
this
exigent
circumstances
test
because
drunk
driving
was
not
a
felony
and
was
not
a
serious
enough
offense.
our
first
response
to
that
on
this
major-minor
distinction
is
that
drunk
driving
is
a
very
serious
offense.
this
court
has
in
its
own
cases
indicated
the
number
of
people
that
are
killed
on
the
highway
each
year
due
to
drunk
drivers.
just
looking
at
it
that
way
i
think
drunk
driving
is
a
serious
offense
justifying
action
by
the
police.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
in
wisconsin
no.
i
think
that
might
be
the
only
state
where
it
is
not.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
yes.
they
created
this
question.
i
think
there
is
also...
they
have
pointed
out
that
they
are
still
concerned
about
it
enough
that
they
authorized
an
arrest
without
a
warrant.
i
think
the
petitioner's
theory
draws
a
big
distinction
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor
and
apparently
in
this
case
had
the
wisconsin
legislature
really
classified
drunk
driving
as
a
felony
we
would
not
be
here.
in
other
words,
he
is
leaving
it
up
to
a
legislative
decision
and
if
the
state
can
act
to
justify
this
arrest
simply
by
classifying
this
as
a
felony
i
think
the
state
can
also
express
its
interest
in
this
offense
through
its
arrest
laws
because
if
we
are
only
talking
about
reclassifying
as
a
felony
to
justify
the
arrest
i
think
the
state
can
classify
as
a
misdemeanor
a
forfeiture
and
in
another
chapter
of
the
statutes
authorize
an
arrest
for
misdemeanor
or
forfeiture
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
which
wisconsin
has
done.
it
has
passed
statutes
changing
the
arrest
law
from
a
common
law.
under
the
statutes
the
statute
in
the
felony
code...
pardon
me,
the
criminal
code
is
that
police
officers
may
arrest
for
any
crime
if
they
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
crime
has
been
or
is
being
committed.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
do
not
understand
how
they
do
not
agree.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
well,
in
this
case
they
said
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
offense
had
been
committed,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
probable
cause
they
were
authorized
to
make
the
arrest.
in
addition
to
the
statute
in
the
criminal
code
dealing
with
misdemeanors
and
felonies
classifying
together
there
is
also
the
statute
in
the
motor
vehicle
code--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--well,
the
issue
presented
to
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
whether
there
were
exigent
circumstances
and
whether
there
was
probable
cause,
and
they
found
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances
and
with
those
two
they
made
the
arrest
in
the
context
of
this
case.
in
the
criminal
code
misdemeanors
and
felonies
are
treated
together
because
they
both
fall
within
the
definition
of
a
crime.
the
legislature
has
indicated
that
its
interest
is
that
the
police
have
the
same
arrest
authorities
for
a
misdemeanor
or
for
a
felony.
in
the
motor
vehicle
code
the
statute
provides
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
make
an
arrest
for
a
traffic
regulation
by
a
violation
of
traffic
regulation
if
he
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
violation
has
occurred
or
is
being
committed.
it
is
parallel
language
so
i
think
the
legislature
has
indicated
that
it
wants
the
arrest
authority
for
its
officers
to
be
the
same
whether
the
case
involves
a
forfeiture
or
misdemeanor
or
a
felony.
i
think
it
has
expressed
its
concern
that
way
as
opposed
to
classifying
this
as
a
felony.
i
think
just
because
it
gives
a
drunk
driver
a
break
by
not
calling
it
a
felony
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
is
not
interested
enough
that
it
wants
to
obtain
convictions
for
this.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
is
correct.
but
he
is
still
getting
a
break
by
not
having
it
classified
that
way
and
it
is
still
a
decision.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
is
correct.
it
is
one
of
the
ways.
i
think
another
way
is
looking
at
how--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--or
enforcement
of
the
laws.
here
i
think
they
have
indicated
through
their
arrest
law
which
they
have
made
the
same
for
traffic
regulations
as
for
crimes
that
they
also
want
those
regulations
enforced
just
as
strictly
as
crimes
whether
the
crime
be
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
no,
all
crimes
in
wisconsin
whether
it
be
misdemeanors
or
arrests
or
felonies
are
subject
to
arrest
on
probable
cause.
there
is
no
misdemeanor
that
has
to
be
committed
in
the
officer's
presence
to
be
subject
to
arrest
just
all
misdemeanors
are--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--well,
he
would
have
to
have
exigent
circumstances
to
go
with
the
probable
cause.
i
think
you
cannot
simply
because
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
a
misdemeanor
has
occurred
just
as
if
a
felony--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--i
think
he
has
to
under
the
normal
exigent
circumstances
it
would
require
more
than
just
think
he
is
going
into
his
house
to
avoid
the
arrest
at
that
point.
if
he--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--yes,
if
the
officer
saw
the
offense
being
committed
and
merely
followed
a
hot
pursuit
theory.
if
a
third
party
reports
to
the
officer
that
a
misdemeanor
occurred
two
days
before
and
just
because
the
person
is
in
the
house
the
officer
i
do
not
think
can
walk
in.
if
he
believed
that
the
person
was
going
to
get
an
airplane
within
the
next
15
minutes
and
fly
to
alaska
or
to
somewhere
else
then
he
has
the
other
exigent
circumstance
of
fearing
the
suspect
is
going
to
flee.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
think
under
that
qualification
it
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
is
going
to
occur.
he
cannot
just
think
of
the
possibility
as
a
reasonable
probability.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
i
just
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
any
statutory
question--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--well,
as
far
as
arrest
authorities.
the
other--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--to
arrest
in
the
context
of
probable
cause.
i
think
this
court
as
far
as
in
what
type
of
offenses
an
officer
may
enter
a
home
to
make
an
arrest
for
exigent
circumstances
has
already
indicated
that
the
entry
can
be
made
in
the
case
of
something
less
than
a
felony.
i
think
in
this
case
it
also
has
to
be
recognized
this
case
is
not
simply
just
a
question
of
arrest.
the
case
involves
obviously
a
question
of
search.
they
needed
to
obtain
evidence.
they
were
not
going
to
arrest
the
evidence.
they
searched
coupled
with
arrest.
in
the
camara
case
which
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
this
afternoon
and
have
heard
many
times
it
involved
a
misdemeanor.
a
violation
of
the
building
code
in
that
case
was
a
misdemeanor.
the
court
held
that
the
building
inspector
normally
needed
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home
to
check
for
the
building
code
violation.
however,
the
court
said
that
the
entry
could
be
made
without
a
warrant
if
there
was
probable
cause
and
an
emergency
existed.
i
think
in
the
emergency
language
in
that
case
they
are
referring
to
the
same
thing
as
exigent
circumstances.
some
of
the
cases
cited
in
camara
for
the
emergency
have
also
been
cited
in
other
cases
under
the
heading
of
exigent
circumstances.
the
camara
case
indicates
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
police
can
enter
a
residence
to
search
for
evidence
of
a
misdemeanor
if
they
possess
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
it
is
the
same
type
of
case
as
here.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
again,
under
the
cases
on
exigent
circumstances
it
is
more
than
just
speculation
or
fear
by
the
police.
they
are
going
to
have
to
have
i
think
a
reasonable
lead--
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
--building
code
violations
i
think
are
somewhat
different
in
that
usually
you
enforce
the
building
code
to
cure
the
violation.
if
the
threat
of
violation
is
going
to
cause
the
person
to
cure
the
violation
maybe
it
has
already
served
its
purpose.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
however,
when
the
police
entered
they
did
not
know
he
was
in
bed.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
w.
kleinmaier
basically
no.
i
think
that
exigent

doctrine

think
that
pretty
well
sums

also.
thank
