unknown
speaker
you
said
at
night.
about
what
time
was
it?
unknown
speaker
when
you
said
at
the
outset
that
this
was
truly
an
exigent
circumstances
case,
did
you
mean
that
the
exigent
circumstance
is
the
need
of
the
officers
to
apprehend
this
gentleman
while
he
might
still
be
subject
to
a
breathalyzer
test
or
observation?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
to
preserve
evidence.
unknown
speaker
did
the
circuit
court
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
it
had
been
consent?
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
likewise
did
not
pass
on
the
issue
of
consent?
unknown
speaker
did
the
officer
know
the
man?
unknown
speaker
he
did
not
know
that
he
drove
the
car?
unknown
speaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
every
car
on
the
street
is
driven
by
the
owner?
unknown
speaker
what--
unknown
speaker
--the
law
must
be
different
in
your
state.
i
thought
the
crime,
a
misdemeanor
was
committed
not
in
the
presence
of
a
police
officer.
you
had
to
swear
out
a
warrant.
is
that
the
law
in
wisconsin?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is
what
is
the
law
in
wisconsin?
unknown
speaker
does
the
policeman
on
a
story
that
somebody
tells
him
have
a
right
to
go
and
lock
up
a
man?
is
that
the
law
in
wisconsin?
unknown
speaker
does
the
law
say
he
could
break
the
door
down?
unknown
speaker
mr.
baldwin,
would
you
say
that
is
true
if
the
officer
had
personally
observed
your
client
behind
the
wheel
and
doing
erratic
driving
and
had
observed
all
of
the
circumstances
and
had
had
to
chase
him
to
the
house
in
an
effort
to
apprehend
him?
could
the
officer
have
followed
him
inside
to
make
the
arrest
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
should
make
a
difference
from
state
to
state
as
to
how
the
state
chooses
to
classify
an
offense?
in
one
state
drunk
driving
might
be
made
a
felony
and
in
another
a
misdemeanor.
does
it
make
any
real
differences
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
makes
it
very
difficult,
does
it
not,
for
an
officer
in
a
jurisdiction
where
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
if
there
had
been
no
prior
conviction
but
it
would
be
a
felony
if
there
had
and
the
officer
does
not
know
that
and
he
does
not
know
whether
he
has
to
stop
at
the
door
or
not?
that
strikes
me
as
kind
of
a
difficult
line
to
be
drawn.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baldwin,
i
think
the
offense
in
schmerber
v.
california
was
also
a
misdemeanor
and
yet
the
court
there
said
that
exigent
circumstances
existed
for
taking
the
sum
from
him
by
blood.
unknown
speaker
so
could
it
here.
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
he
had
known
that
he
had
a
prior
arrest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
baldwin,
could
i
ask
you
what
were
you
complaining
about
when
you
appealed?
the
reason
your
client
had
been
hurt
is
that
his
driver's
license
had
been
revoked.
that
is
what
you
were
really
complaining
about.
unknown
speaker
is
that
not...
so
that
the
end
result
that
you
wanted
to
attain
in
the
state
courts
was
that
the
driver's
license
would
be
restored.
unknown
speaker
is
the
revocation
procedure
not
a
civil
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
we
ever
applied
the
exclusionary
rule
to
a
civil
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
barred
the
use
of
this
evidence?
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
say
that
this
refusal
and
taking
him
down
to
the
station
was
a
fruit
of
an
illegal
entry
and
that
is
what
your
argument
is.
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
argument
to
save
your
driver's
license
in
a
civil
proceeding.
i
do
not
know
of
any
cases
where
we--
unknown
speaker
--i
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
that
cannot
control
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
do
not
know
why
we
have
to
decide
this
fourth
amendment
case
if
after
we
decided
it
the
evidence
would
be
admissible
anyway
because
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
i
know
they
did,
but
the
result
is
right.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
challenging...
were
you
convicted
for
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
are
not
challenging
the
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
whatever
evidence
was
seized
or
not
has
not
tainted
or
otherwise
affected
the
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
you
are
solely
objecting
to
the
cancelling
your
driver's
license.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
you,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
up
here
on
fourth
amendment
grounds.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
ruled
against
you
on
every
conceivable
state
ground
you
could
have
so
you
must
be
here
on
a
federal
ground.
i,
too,
like
justice
white
had
thought
you
were
making
a
claim
under
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
interested
in
that
in
the
abstract
are
you?
you
are
interested
in
suppressing
the
evidence
that
arose
out
of
the
arrest.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
an
abstract
proposition
under
the
ruling
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
because
you
say
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
may
have
misinterpreted
the
fourth
amendment
law
of
arrest
apparently
but
nonetheless
ruled
against
you.
if
you
are
not
entitled
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law
to
have
the
exclusionary
rule
brought
over
to
a
civil
proceeding
perhaps
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
opinion
may
have
contained
an
abstractly
wrong
proposition
of
the
federal
constitution
but
the
result
was
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
be
here
because
of
something
that
is
done
about
the
criteria
not
because
of
what
it
said
about
it.
unknown
speaker
since
you
are
speculating
there,
counsel,
do
you
exclude
the
possibility
that
if
not
apprehended
he
might
go
out
and
drive
his
car
immediately?
unknown
speaker
he
might
decide
that
after
getting
a
couple
of
aspirins
and
some
coffee
to
go
out
and
get
the
car
and
bring
it
home
where
it
would
be
safe.
unknown
speaker
he
might
not
be,
but
he
might
think
he
was.
that
happens.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
how
you
have
distinguished
schmerber.
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
make
any
difference
that
the
offense
in
fact
might
have
been
prosecuted
as
a
higher
level
offense
than
it
was?
is
the
critical
thing
not
how
the
state
in
fact
prosecuted
it?
unknown
speaker
schmerber
is
certainly
against
you
on
that
point.
it
was
a
misdemeanor
prosecution
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
did
not
think
you
thought
that
exigencies
made
any
difference
in
misdemeanor
cases.
unknown
speaker
real
ones
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kleinmaier,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
case
might
possibly
be
moot.
your
adversary
indicated
the
man
has
actually
been
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor
offense.
i
gather
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record
if
it
is
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
if
that
were
true
was
his
license
automatically
revoked
as
a
result
of
that
conviction?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
then
he
was
convicted
in
the
criminal
case
without
the
state
using
the
evidence
of
the
refusal
to
take
the
test.
unknown
speaker
because
i
wondered
in
reading
this
record
really
how
badly
you
needed
this
evidence.
there
is
pretty
strong
evidence
that
he
was
intoxicated.
does
your
exigency
depend,
i
take
it,
on
the
fact
that
you
really
needed
the
evidence
in
order
to
prove
your
case?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
only
evidence
you
have.
he
saw
him
drive,
too.
unknown
speaker
he
smelled
his
breath.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
matter
of...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
he
did
not
testify
did
he?
unknown
speaker
presumably
he
was
available
as
a
witness
at
the
main
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
this
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
understand
that
if
the
arrest
was
unlawful
whether
for
state
reasons
or
federal
reasons
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
refusal
to
take
the
test
could
not
have
been
put
into
evidence
if
the
arrest
was
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
so
you
agree
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
required
to
decide
the
federal
constitutional
question
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
not
be
sound.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
into
the
exigent
circumstances
is
the
inception
of
the
concept
of
the
exigent
circumstances
affected
by
the
observations
of
the
seriousness
of
his
driving
condition?
for
example,
the
witness
jablonic
i
think
his
name
was
said
he
had
undertaken
to
interfere
with
this
fellow's
driving
apparently
because
he
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
kill
somebody.
unknown
speaker
what
impact
does
that
have
on
the
whole
picture
of
exigent
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
the
statement
in
your
record
is
because
i
realized
they
would
probably
kill
somebody
and
i
immediately
did
thus
and
so.
unknown
speaker
is
that
evidence
available
for
a
license
cancellation
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
just
so
i
am
clear
on
it
i
take
it
here
the
license
was
suspended
because
of
the
refusal
of
mr.
welsh
to
take
the
breathalyzer
or
the
blood
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
he
asserted
that
his
refusal
was
reasonable
because
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
under
wisconsin
law
if
the
arrest
is
unlawful
is
that
treated
as
a
reason
for
refusing
to
take
the
test?
unknown
speaker
when
the
officer
was
at
the
door
does
the
record
show
that
he
was
aware
of
mr.
jablonic's
statement
in
detail
that
he
was
afraid
the
driver
was
going
to
kill
somebody
or
was
he
just
responding
to
the
telephone
warning
that
the
lady
had
given?
unknown
speaker
is
a
first
offense
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
does
it
suggest
that
your
legislature
may
have
created
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
the
only
trouble
with
your
argument
is
that
your
court
does
not
agree
with
you.
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
your
court
did
not
agree
with
what
you
just
said
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
could
not
get
it
out
of
that
opinion.
i
got
it
out
of
the
dissent.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
just
giving
them
a
break
by
not
calling
it
a
felony.
it
also
does
not
have
the
penalties
associated
with
it
that
it
would
if
it
were
a
felony.
he
cannot
go
to
jail
for
as
long
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
penalty
that
the
state
legislature
seeks
to
impose
is
one
of
the
ways
we
determine
how
important
the
state
interest
in
the
matter
is?
unknown
speaker
the
procedure
for
arrest.
unknown
speaker
there
are
not
other
categories
of
misdemeanors
that
are
so
treated
in
wisconsin
for
arrest
purposes?
unknown
speaker
in
your
mind
is
there
a
right
of
an
officer
to
follow
any
misdemeanor
offender
into
a
home
to
make
an
arrest
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
probable
cause
to
believe
someone
has
committed
a
misdemeanor
offense
and
that
the
person
is
getting
away
and
going
into
his
home
to
avoid
arrest.
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
does
our
santana
case
not
answer
that
in
the
affirmative?
unknown
speaker
or
if
it
were
shooting
birds
out
of
season
and
he
thought
that
they
were
going
to
be
eaten
in
the
next
hour
and
a
half
they
could
go
in
and--
unknown
speaker
--general,
in
wisconsin
is
a
police
officer
entitled
to
shoot
a
misdemeanor
who
is
trying
to
run?
unknown
speaker
you
said
it
was
all
the
same.
unknown
speaker
oh,
this
is
limited
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
had
a
building
code
violation
and
the
police
had
the
same
degree
of
reliable
evidence
they
had
here
but
they
were
afraid
the
man
was
about
to
fix
it,
could
they
break
into
the
house
to
arrest
him
before
he
fixed
it
because
that
would
void
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
say
they
had
fairly
reliable
evidence
that
that
was
about
to
happen
as
they
did
here.
we
want
to
be
sure
to
get
a
conviction.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
one
might
argue
that
keeping
this
man
in
bed
might
have
been
the
best
way
to
avoid
the
danger
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
i
gather
that
your
position
is
that
exigent
circumstances
satisfied
sufficiently
where
there
was
possibility
of
disappearance
of
the
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
you
have
to
rely
on
anything
more
than
that
do
you?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday
next
at
10:00.
