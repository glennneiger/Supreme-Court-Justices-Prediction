mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
exigent
circumstances
case.
on
that
proposition
i
think
there
is
agreement
between
the
state
and
the
defendant.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
will
justify
the
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
his
home.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
calling
fourth
amendment
standards
upheld
the
right
of
police
without
a
warrant
and
without
establishing
consent
to
enter
a
home
at
night
to
arrest
the
householder
for
a
traffic
offense
that
was
not
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
officer
reportedly
heard
the
call
at
8:49
p.m.
there
was
some
dispute
as
to
how
long
it
took
the
officer
to
get
to
the
house.
i
think
it
is
generally
agreed
it
is
about
9:00.
that
was
about
a
week
before
we
would
have
gone
on
to
daylight
savings
time
so
it
was
dark.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
justified
the
traffic
arrest
applying
its
traffic
arrest
statute,
and
it
held
that
exigent
circumstances
justified
the
arrest.
it
did
so
for
three
reasons:
first,
that
the
arrest
was
justified
by
a
hot
pursuit
doctrine;
secondly,
that
the
defendant
who
as
i
said
was
arrested
in
his
home
in
his
bedroom
constituted
a
possible
threat
to
public
safety;
and
third,
that
the
arrest
was
necessary
in
order
to
secure
evidence
of
possible
intoxication.
now
on
the
facts
we
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
arresting
officer
knew.
the
arresting
officer
relied
on
an
eye
witness
who
saw
a
car
driven
erratically,
crossed
in
front
of
oncoming
traffic
and
stopped
or
got
stuck
in
an
open
field
or
cemetery.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
officers
justified,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
entry
into
the
home
as
required
by
the
need
to
obtain
a
blood-alcohol
test,
officer
daley
said,
within
two
hours
of
the
event
to
be
proved.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
this
was
to
preserve...
as
officer
daley
said,
yes,
to
preserve
evidence
of
intoxication
he
felt
he
had
to
enter
the
home
under
those
circumstances.
the
officer
had
been
called
by
a
passing
motorist
and
spoke
to
the
eye
witness.
we
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
eye
witness
said,
but
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
what
the
eye
witness
testified
on
the
stand
where
he
said
he
thought
that
the
errant
driver
was
either
drunk
or
sick
and
what
the
officer
said
he
said.
the
officer
said
he
received
the
opinion
that
the
errant
driver
was
definitely
intoxicated.
there
was
a
difference.
my
point
is
that
we
would
know
what
the
arresting
officer
knew
or
thought
if
we
had
a
warrant
applied
for
during
the
course
of
that
next
hour
or
so.
the
officer
did
trace
the
automobile
to
the
defendant's
home
which
was
about
half
a
mile
away,
went
quickly
to
the
home,
knocked
on
the
door.
that
is
clear.
what
happened
at
the
door
is
in
dispute
because
the
sixteen-year-old
step-daughter
who
answered
the
knock
was
not
available
to
testify
to
when
this
hearing
occurred
about
two
years
later.
the
officer
went
upstairs
to
the
bedroom
where
he
encountered
edward
welsh--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--the
circuit
court
explicitly
said
we
do
not
examine
the
question
of
consent.
its
rationale
was
that
the
witnesses
who
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
consent
were
not
then
available.
the
circuit
court
held,
judge
frankel
held
that
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
including
the
hot
pursuit
doctrine
justified
this
pursuit
and
entry
into
the
home.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
likewise
said
that
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
justified
excusing
the
warrant
and
consent
requirement.
the
court
of
appeals
of
wisconsin,
however,
had
reversed
the
trial
court
because
there
was
no
finding
of
consent.
in
turn,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
by
a
vote
of
four
votes
to
two
found
that
consent
was
not
necessary
to
be
shown
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
remembered
the
name
from
an
incident
that
happened
he
said
a
week
or
two
before...
actually
it
probably
was
somewhat
earlier
than
that...
in
which
he
said
he
had
arrested
mr.
welsh
in
an
alcohol-related
disturbance.
that
is
all
we
have
in
the
record,
but
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
traffic.
it
did
not
say
anything
about
traffic.
it
said
it
was
an
alcohol-related
disturbance.
that
is
what
we
have
in
the
record.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
he
obviously
was
highly
suspicious,
of
course,
sure.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
he
was
highly
suspicious
that
the
car
had
been
driven
by
the
owner,
and
the
owner,
of
course,
is
the
defendant
in
this
case.
he
did
not
know.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
oh,
no.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
officer
was
suspicious.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
if,
for
example,
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
officer
had
encountered
my
client
on
the
door
steps
of
the
home,
we
do
not
deny
that
there
would
have
been
a
right
to
stop,
investigate,
question
and
if
the
officer
found
evidence
of
intoxication
to
make
an
arrest,
we
don't
deny
that
is
a
possibility.
but
we
do
contest
the
right
of
the
officers--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--that
is
unquestionably
the
common
law,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
i
regret--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--the
wisconsin
law
apparently
from
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
opinion
does
not
require
that
there
be
an
in-presence
offense
in
order
to
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor.
the
law
was
changed
in
1971.
the
legislative
history
is
obscure,
but
prior
to
1971--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--absolutely
not,
sir.
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
saying
you
enter.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
should
not
apply
for
a
misdemeanor
or
minor
offense.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
answer
i
give
to
that,
justice
o'connor
is
no
as
long
as
it
is
a
minor
offense.
if
an
offense
had
occurred,
for
example
failure
to
stay
at
the
scene
of
an
accident,
far
more
serious
and
could
even
be
a
felony
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
then
the
case
for
a
hot
pursuit
and
entry
would
be
permissible.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
bright
line,
if
you
will,
is
at
the
door
of
the
house
for
a
minor
offense.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
it
does
for
two
reasons,
and
i
think
they
are
illustrated
by
the
law
of
wisconsin.
the
first
point
is
that
reasonableness
under
fourth
amendment
standards
requires
a
balancing
of
the
actual
governmental
interest
asserted
to
justify
invasion.
what
is
the
actual
governmental
interest?
that
is
determined
by
the
legislature.
the
legislature
may
view
some
offenses
more
seriously
than
other
states
balanced
against
the
seriousness
of
the
intrusion.
here
it
is
an
intrusion
into
a
highly
protected
place
where
expectations
of
privacy
are
greatest.
the
second
reason
may
be
as
in
wisconsin
the
state
wishes
to
define
reasonableness
or
define
whether
or
not
it
has
jurisdiction
where
an
arrest
has
occurred
under
questionable
circumstances.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
it
is
a
difficult
line,
but
it
is
a
difficult
line
because
the
legislature
of
wisconsin
has
drafted
its
driving
while
intoxicated
statutes
in
that
particular
way.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
justice
rehnquist,
you
are
absolutely
correct.
the
charge
in
schmerber
was
for
a
misdemeanor,
but
as
i
read
schmerber
and
i
think
it
is
in
a
footnote
the
underlying
act
could
have
been
charged
as
a
felony
at
the
time
by
the
arresting
officer.
the
second
point
is...
excuse
me.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
so
could
it
here?
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
if
he
had
known
there
had
been
a
prior
arrest,
then
i
would
have
to
rely
on
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
and
i
could
not
make
this
assertion
that
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
should
not
apply
to
an
arrest
for
a
minor
offense.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
that
is
the--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
it
is
most
certainly
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
this
court
does
not
have
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
fourth
amendment,
justice
white--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--if
i
might
correct,
i
think,
justice
white,
the
problem
is
created
by
the
law
of
wisconsin.
the
breathalyzer
test
cannot
be
administered
under
civil
law
of
wisconsin
unless
there
has
been
a
citation
for
the
offense
and
an
arrest.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
there
must
be
an
arrest.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
state
of
wisconsin
viewed
this
as
a
criminal-type
proceeding.
the
hearing
judge
who
found
that
the
refusal--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--the
state
of
wisconsin
applied
fourth
amendment
standards,
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--well,
there
is
a
link
proceeding
here.
it
is
perfectly
clear
there
is
a
link
proceeding.
there
is
the
charge
of
driving
while
intoxicated.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
subsequently.
it
is
not
in
the
record,
of
course.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
not
at
this
point.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice
white,--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--well,
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
is
a
serious
interest.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people,
their
places
and
effects
from
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
it
is
not
restricted
simply
to
the
protection
of
individuals
in
the
criminal
process.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
mr.
justice
white,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
invoked
here
for
two
reasons,
first,
because
wisconsin
law
does
not
permit
the
breathalyzer
or
the
blood-alcohol
test
to
commit
evidence
unless
there
has
been
an
arrest.
that
is
wisconsin
rule.
it
is
not
an
exclusionary
rule
required
by
the
fourth.
it
is
an
exclusionary
rule
required
by
the
law
of
wisconsin.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
it
seems
to
me,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
issue
here
is
the
reasonableness
of
an
arrest
which
is
not
a
question
of
necessarily
the
introduction
of
the
evidence.
it
is
the
reasonableness
of
an
arrest.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
the
suppression
rule
was
simply
a
product
of
the
law
of
wisconsin.
i
am
interested
in
the
holding
that
this
was
a
forbidden
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
well,
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
construed
an
arrest
as
lawful
under
fourth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
standards.
it
is
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
said
about
the
arrest
criteria
is
why
we
are
here.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
well,
the
consequence,
of
course,
of
the
lawful
arrest
was
the
loss
of
driving
privileges
and,
of
course,
incidentally
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
the
officer's
testimony
of
what
he
saw
in
the
bedroom
in
the
criminal
case
which,
of
course,
was
force.
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
a
product
remedial
device
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
before
this
court.
what
is
before
this
court
is
the
lawfulness
of
an
arrest
of
the
defendant
in
his
bedroom
without
consent
and
without
warrant
for
a
traffic
offense
not
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
if
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
applies
it
is
our
belief
that
the
facts
do
not
justify
its
application
here.
there
is
no
risk
of
escape.
edward
welsh
was
where
he
had
every
right
to
be
in
bed.
he
had
every
right...
the
public
interest
is
served
perhaps
by
people
who
are
sick
or
intoxicated
going
home
to
bed.
secondly,
there
were
no
fire
arms
present
nor
any
suggestion
that
any
harm
was
going
to
occur
to
anyone.
there
was
no
cry
for
help.
the
case
would
be
quite
different
if
officer
daley
at
the
threshold
had
heard
the
noise
of
breaking
crockery
and
a
cry
for
help.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
well,
his
car
was
half
a
mile
away,
of
course.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
if
he
was
sober,
of
course,
that
would
be
perfectly
permissible.
the
officers--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--there
are
several
alternatives
that
would
have
been
less
stringent
than
simply
entering
the
house
without
establishing
consent,
one
of
which
of
course
is
to
keep
your
eye
on
the
car,
iron
boots
or
what
have
you.
the
second
possibility
is
one
of
the
officer's
could
have
gone
for
a
warrant
or
called
for
a
warrant.
there
is
no
specific
provision
for
a
telephonic
warrant
in
wisconsin,
but
i
read
nothing
in
wisconsin
law
that
forbids
the
use
of
this
innovative
technique.
the
trial
judge
suggested
there
were
three
policemen
in
the
home.
two
could
have
watched
the
house.
one
could
have
called
for
a
warrant
or
went
in
pursuit
of
a
warrant.
the
only
evidence
that
could
be
destroyed
was
that
which
was
in
the...
excuse
the
expression...
the
lawful
possession
of
the
defendant.
this
is
not
contraband.
if
he
was
intoxicated
that
evidence
was
not
going
to
disappear
instantly.
it
takes
a
period
of
time.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
allowed
evidence
of
the
blood-alcohol
test
to
be
introduced
three
and
a
half
hours
after
an
accident.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
well,
excuse
me.
schmerber
for
two
points,
first,
the
underlying
offense
could
have
been
far
more
serious
in
schmerber.
secondly,
schmerber
was
arrested
at
the
hospital
and
the
blood
test
was
taken
two
hours
after
the
event
to
be
proven.
it
seems
to
me
the
exigencies
in
schmerber
were
far
more
serious
than
the
exigencies
in
the
welsh
case.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
i
think
what
the
arresting
officer
knew,
i
submit,
is
important
in
establishing
grounds
for
the
arrest.
the
penalty
that
the
state
assesses
for
a
breach
is
relevant
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
penalty
helps
us
establish
how
the
legislature
has
viewed
the
seriousness
of
the
underlying
offense,
the
more
serious
the
offense
the
more
severe
the
penalty.
secondly,
the
common
law
which
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
is
instructive
in
determining
what
is
reasonable
under
fourth
amendment
standards.
at
common
law
as
justice
marshall
has
pointed
out,
arrests
for
misdemeanors
require
that
they
be
in
the
presence
of
the
officer.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
the
absolute
rule
that
this
court
should
apply
here--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--he
was
arrested
where
the
police
had
a
right
to
be
at
the
hospital
two
hours
after
the
event
under
conditions
where
he
might
have
received
medical
treatment
or
have
been
out
of
the
custody
of
the
police
for
a
long
period
of
time.
there
was
a
real
exigency
is
schmerber.
in
south
dakota
v.
neville
this
court
indicated--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--if
the
underlying
arrest--
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
--that
is
my
fallback
position,
justice
white.
if
it
is
a
minor
offense
at
the
outset,
i
believe
that
the
exigent
circumstances
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
enter
a
home.
schmerber
did
not
apply
any
right
to
enter
the
home.
schmerber
was
a
blood
test
at
the
hospital
two
hours
after
the
event
to
be
proven
under
circumstances
where
there
was
no
possibility
of
delay
if
the
man
was
going
to
receive
medical
treatment
and
was
going
to
be
incommunicado
and
unavailable.
there
would
have
been
a
greater
intrusion
had
the
police
waited
being
treated
in
a
hospital.
this
is
a
case
of
the
entry
into
the
home.
as
far
as
the
police
officer
knew
it
was
a
first
offense.
even
if
the
police
had
known
it
was
a
second
offense
it
still
is
punishable
by
the
balance
of
authority
established
in
the
state
as
a
minor
offense.
if
reasonableness,
and
this
court
has
said
many
times
in
terry,
for
example,
in
camara,
is
a
product
of
a
balance
of
the
consideration
of
the
governmental
interest
asserted
on
the
one
hand
and
the
severity
of
the
invasion
on
the
other,
we
submit
that
the
governmental
interest
established
by
the
wisconsin
legislature
suggests
that
this
is
not
the
case
for
a
significant
dilution
of
the
protection
of
one
of
the
specific
places
and
interests
explicitly
provided
in
the
fourth
amendment.
lower
courts
have
given
us
a
number
of
different
tests
on
exigent
circumstances.
i
urge
this
court
to
look
carefully
at
the
california
formulation
which
emphasizes
urgency,
which
emphasizes
the
need
for
speed
and
emphasizes
the
need
to
protect
immediately
life
and
limb.
this,
we
submit,
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
that
fits
the
california
definition
of
people
v.
ramey.
the
district
of
columbia
definition
has
been
criticized
by
the
academics
as
perhaps
complicated,
but
the
district
of
columbia
formulation
which
relies
on
seven
factors
i
submit
has
some
value
because
it
is
a
response
to
the
human
problem.
how
do
we
define
its
broad
generalization?
let's
look
at
the
specific
facts.
let's
try
to
categorize
the
seven-factor
formula
of
dorman
which
we
cite
on
page
43
of
our
brief
has
utility
and
while
it
is
not
a
guide
to
the
policeman
what
is
a
guide
to
the
policeman
is
you
do
not
enter
a
house
at
night
for
a
minor
offense
without
consent
or
without
a
warrant
particularly
if
you
have
not
seen
the
offender
yourself.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gordon
b.
baldwin
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
steven's
question
insofar
as
i
have
been
informed
by
the
principle
counsel
for
mr.
welsh.
he
was
convicted
at
a
jury
trial
in
early
1982
at
which
his
refusal
to
take
the
blood
test
was
in
evidence
which
is
permitted
now
under
south
dakota
v.
neville.
secondly,
officer
daley
testified
as
to
what
he
saw
in
the
bedroom
and
mr.
jablonic
testified.
mr.
jablonic
incidentally
did
not
smell
the
errant
driver's
breath.
for
one
reason
or
another
he
did
not
smell
it,
but
the
jury
did
convict.
one
of
the
jurymen
was
the
wife
of
one
of
my
law
students,
and
this
is
one
of
the
sources
of
my
information.
secondly,
this
court
has
considered
the
problem
of
carnage
on
the
highways
in
a
number
of
instances,
but
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
and
remind
you
of
craig
v.
boren,
an
interesting
case
because
of
the
way
justice
frennan
dealt
with
the
problem
of
statistics
which
oklahoma
had
shown
that
there
was
a
very
high
probability
or
a
higher
probability
of
drunken
driving
offenses
committed
by
young
men
than
by
young
women
but
that
despite
the
statistical
features
which
were
really
quite
overwhelming
it
did
not
justify
a
deprivation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim
to
equal
protection.
similarly
this
court
in
south
dakota
v.
neville
in
a
footnote
indicated
that
perhaps
the
blood
alcohol
test
would
not
have
been
appropriately
taken
or
would
not
have
been
appropriately
mentioned
in
the
case
if
it
had
been
forced
upon
the
defendant.
my
point
is
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
the
battle
against
drunk
drivers
there
still
are
fourteenth
amendment
protections.
similarly
in
mincey
v.
arizona
this
court
has
declined
to
find
a
murder
scene
exception.
my
final
slogan
and
i
think
this
is
a
helpful
one
is
that
exigency
is
not
the
same
as
expediency.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
