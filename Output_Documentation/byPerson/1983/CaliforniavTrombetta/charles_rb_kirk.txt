mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
recently
in
south
dakota
versus
neville
this
court
again
decried
the
carnage
caused
by
drunken
drivers
on
our
highways.
spurred
on
by
increasing
public
awareness,
and
encouraged
by
the
federal
government,
the
states
are
stepping
up
law
enforcement
efforts
to
combat
this
national
problem,
and
one
of
the
most
effective
tools
in
law
enforcement's
arsenal
is
the
breath
alcohol
test.
such
tests
are
used
in
every
state,
the
district
of
columbia,
and
puerto
rico.
in
california,
which
i
am
sure
is
typical,
breath
alcohol
tests
are
used
in
two-thirds
of
all
drunk
driving
arrests.
evidential
breath
test
instruments
provide
a
rapid,
economical,
and
accurate
means
of
immediately
determining
the
suspect's
blood
alcohol
content.
because
they
are
self-contained,
automatic
units,
they
can
be
easily
and
accurately
operated
by
a
field
officer
with
minimal
training.
the
ease
and
rapidity
of
operation
allows
the
officer
to
complete
the
test
quickly
and
return
to
the
highway
to
do
his
job.
immediate
results
also
permit
additional
sample
collection
where
an
unexpectedly
low
result
suggests
intoxication
by
combination
of
alcohol
and
drugs.
breath
testing
is
also
the
least
intrusive
of
the
options
from
the
suspect's
point
of
view.
it
does
not
involve
bodily
intrusion
or
invasion
of
privacy,
and
assures
the
shortest
period
of
detention.
breath
testing
is
broadly
accepted
as
valid.
self-contained
devices
avoid
the
possibility
of
human
error
or
manipulation
and
allow
subsequent
checks
upon
the
accuracy
of
the
test
system.
now,
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
after
a
california
court
of
appeals
held
unconstitutional
as
a
violation
of
federal
due
process
use
of
an
evidential
breath
test
instrument
unless
that
device
preserves
the
breath
sample
actually
tested
for
possible
retesting
by
the
defendant
or
alternatively
a
procedure
is
followed
which
collects
an
equivalent
sample
for
the
defendant's
use.
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
the
instrument
at
issue
is
an
intoxolizer,
widely
used
on
a
national
basis,
and
constituting
82
percent
of
the
evidential
breath
test
devices
in
california.
now,
i
will
first
focus
on
the
machine
itself,
and
then
i
am
going
to
outline
why
its
use
does
not
offend
due
process.
the
intoxolizer
does
not
save
any
sample
for
possible
retesting.
in
use,
the
suspect
blows
through
a
tube
leading
into
a
chamber
within
the
machine.
when
the
device
determines
that
the
air
deep
in
the
lungs
has
been
reached,
the
sample
is
momentarily
held
for
analysis
using
infrared
light,
and
the
blood
alcohol
content
is
measured.
then
the
test
sample
is
automatically
pumped
out
of
the
machine,
and
the
chamber
is
purged
with
clear
air.
the
purge
cycle
promotes
test
integrity
by
ensuring
that
no
residual
alcohol
remains
as
a
contaminant,
that
the
instrument
is
starting
from
zero,
and
that
no
capricious
event
occurs
to
interfere
with
test
accuracy.
it
is
actually
a
diagnostic
step
which
protects
the
defendant.
the
machine
must
be
purged
to
prepare
it
for
another
test
on
that
same
person
or
another
individual.
thus
the
test
sample
purged
to
clear
the
machine
is
automatically
destroyed
as
an
integral
part
of
the
analytical
process,
and
it
is
never
collected
or
reduced
to
a
form
which
permits
practical
retention.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
by
its
terms
extends
not
only
to
the
intoxolizer
but
to
all
evidential
breath
test
machines.
the
others
approved
for
use
in
california
also
destroy
the
sample
during
the
testing
process.
hence
the
decision
condemns
as
unconstitutional
all
california
breath
testing,
and
should
such
a
rule
be
extended
to
the
other
states,
will
greatly
impair
the
effort
to
control
the
drinking
driver.
the
great
national
concern
over
this
disquieting
prospect
is
reflected
in
the
amici
briefs
which
have
been
filed
in
support
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
it
is
used
virtually
from
shore
to
shore.
obviously,
each
state
is
free
to
choose
its
own
machines.
the
national
highway
and
traffic
safety
administration
has
approved
a
great
number.
i
know
that
the
intoxolizer
is
favored
and
used
exclusively
in
a
number
of
states.
now,
on
what
basis
did
the
california
court--
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
--your
honor,
that
is
talking
about
the
indium
tube
device
or
actually
the
gas
chromatograph,
which
analyzes
an
indium
tube
as
part
of
the
process.
that
is
true,
that
exists,
and
that
is
approved
in
california.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
no,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
--it
is
not
widely
used
in
california,
and
there
is
only
one
single
county
which
has
ever
made
any
kind
of
continuous
use,
and
that
is
the
county
of
san
bernadino,
which
since
1973
has
used
it
because
of
the
difficulty
of
collecting
breath
samples
in
a
widespread
county.
now,
on
what
basis
did
the
california
court
make
such
a
wholesale
condemnation
in
trombetta,
purportedly
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
as
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court?
in
people
versus
hitch,
that
court
looked
to
the
opinion
in
brady
versus
maryland
and
divined
a
constitutional
principle
requiring
preservation
of
any
evidence
which
might
possibly
be
favorable
to
the
accused.
now,
i
say
divined
because
that
is
exactly
what
the
california
supreme
court
did.
the
hitch
rule
cannot
be
found
in
brady
versus
maryland
or
in
any
other
decision
of
this
court
nor
can
it
be
found
anywhere
in
the
constitution.
in
a
criminal
case,
the
state
must
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
the
constitution
does
not
require
proof
beyond
all
possible
doubt
and
to
an
absolute
certainty.
the
state
need
not
negate
all
speculative
possibilities,
which
seems
to
be
the
primary
focus
of
respondents
and
their
amici.
and
the
trombetta
decision
itself
imposes
sample
preservation
to
make
proof
of
guilt
an
absolute
certainty.
the
hitch-trombetta
preservation
requirement
is
predicated
upon
a
claimed
need
to
provide
the
defendant
with
any
evidence
which
has
a
reasonable
possibility
of
yielding
results
favorable
to
the
defense
or
casting
doubt
upon
the
state's
case.
it
was
just
that
"might
possibly"
standard
which
this
court
recently
rejected
in
united
states
versus
valenzuela
vernow.
the
hitch-trombetta
standard
is
in
fact
no
standard
at
all.
as
this
court
observed
in
killian
versus
united
states,
almost
everything
is
evidence
of
something,
and
in
valenzuela
vernow,
possibilities
of
favorable
evidence
are
limited
only
by
the
imaginations
of
counsel
and
judges.
this
is
especially
true,
i
believe,
with
any
analytical
measuring
or
recording
method.
ordinarily,
the
only
prerequisite
to
the
admission
of
scientific
tests
are
proof
of
the
expert's
qualifications,
accuracy
of
the
equipment,
and
reliability
of
the
method
followed.
it
is
not
required
that
the
results
of
accepted
methods
be
infallible
to
be
admissible,
possibilities
of
error
going
to
weight
rather
than
to
admissibility.
the
trombetta
and
hitch
cases
depart
from
this
rule
applicable
to
physical
testing
and
require
as
a
matter
of
federal
due
process
that
there
must
be
a
secondary
verification
of
the
primary
test
before
the
primary
test
is
admissible.
now,
the
irony
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
few
areas
in
which
the
defendant
is
so
well
protected.
the
intoxolizer,
as
are
all
evidential
breath
test
instruments
in
california,
has
been
tested
and
approved
by
the
national
highway
and
traffic
safety
administration,
a
neutral
federal
agency.
it
has
also
been
subjected
to
the
rigid
scrutiny,
including
blood-breath
correlation
studies
on
live
subjects
by
the
california
department
of
health,
which
is
a
neutral
agency.
it
is
not
involved
in
law
enforcement.
it
does
not
sell
machines.
this
is
the
neutral
agency
designated
by
our
legislature
as
having
the
expertise
in
this
scientific
field.
and
when
an
instrument
is
approved,
it
can
only
be
used
following
regulated
procedures.
it
is
periodically
checked
for
accuracy,
and
under
these
controls,
the
department
of
health
has
itself
concluded
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
undetected
error.
now,
brady
cannot
be
the
source
of
the
hitch-trombetta
preservation
rule,
since
brady
is
not
a
preservation
case
at
all.
it
is
a
disclosure
case.
brady
requires
the
state
to
disclose
exonerating
material
evidence
to
the
defendant.
it
is
based
upon
the
notion
of
fair
play
inherent
in
our
judicial
system.
the
form
or
continued
physical
existence
of
the
evidence
is
irrelevant
to
the
duty
to
disclose
it.
this
case
does
not
present
a
brady
violation
at
all.
to
violate
the
rule,
there
must
be
a
suppression
of
evidence.
the
evidence
must
be
favorable
to
the
defense,
and
the
evidence
must
be
material.
destruction
in
the
ordinary
course
of
an
analytical
process
is
not
suppression.
this
was
not
evidence
favorable
to
the
defense.
the
contrary
is
true.
nor
would
a
preserved
or
separately
collected
sample
yield
material
evidence,
since
reanalysis
is
itself
subject
to
error
and
cannot
be
verified.
thus
a
discrepancy
between
the
evidential
breath
test
results
and
the
results
of
referee
analysis
creates
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
which
can
be
resolved
but
only
by
going
back
to
the
evidential
breath
test
and
rechecking
its
accuracy.
this
can
already
be
done
without
a
preserved
sample.
trombetta
thus
imposes
a
duty
of
preservation
yielding
at
most
inconclusive
results,
creating
the
circular
route
back
to
the
starting
point,
which
is
the
evidential
breath
test
machine.
certainly
the
constitution
does
not
require
such
wasted
effort.
in
any
event,
sample
prevention
was
not
necessary,
and
therefore
not
material
in
a
constitutional
sense
to
enable
a
probe
of
the
accuracy
of
the
test
results
since
several
suitable
alternate
methods
were
available
for
this
purpose.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
well,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter
that
has
to
be
sent
to
a
laboratory
and
analyzed
there
before
it
is
of
any
value
to
us.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
well,
i
certainly
think
that
it
would
expose
the
state
to
challenge
as
to
the
validity
of
the
results.
i
think
this
is
where
we
run
into
the
kinds
of
attacks
that
the
defense
can
make.
i
do
not
believe
that
due
process
requires
that
the
defendant
necessarily
have
an
independent
right
to
check
everything.
what
i
think
it
does
is
put
a
big
hole
in
the
state's
case.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
well,
again,
i
don't
think
that
due
process
requires
us
to
resort
to
any
particular
procedure.
frankly,
i
think
the
state
would
be
better
off
if
we
could
cheaply
and
accurately
preserve
something,
because
we
would
blow
all
these
attacks
out
of
the
water.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
because
we
do
not
believe
it
is
possible.
we
do
not--
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
--in
colorado,
according
to
the
statistics
that
i
have
cited
to
the
court
in
the
montoya
case,
there
is
an
80
percent
error.
colorado,
if
it
wishes,
can
corroborate
something
with
a
ouija
board,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
state
of
california
to
adopt
that
procedure.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
under
our
regulations,
your
honor,
it
can
be
stored
as
long
and
is
kept
as
long
as
one
year.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
it
has
preservatives
in
it,
and
it
is
stored
under
refrigerated
conditions,
and
it
can
be
retested
for
up
to
one
year
accurately.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
that
does
happen,
frankly.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
now,
due
process
is
the
concept
of
fair
play.
in
a
trial,
it
means
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
challenge
the
state's
case,
and
it
is
violated
only
when
the
opportunity
to
challenge
is
so
restricted
as
to
make
what
should
be
a
disciplined
adversary
contest
into
an
ordeal
in
which
the
defendant
plays
only
a
passive
role.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
well,
i
am
slightly
paraphrasing
some
decisions
of
this
court,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
direct
quote.
but
proof
of
physical
evidence...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
comes
from
that
last
paragraph
of
augenblick,
with
slight
changes,
but
proof
by
physical
evidence
and
its
preservation
for
that
purpose
have
never
been
considered
a
basic
requirement
of
due
process.
indeed,
the
vast
majority
of
the
evidence
in
any
case
is
neither
physical
nor
corroborated
by
it.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
in
the
opinion
of
the
state
of
california,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
in
this
case
there
was
some
evidence,
but
there
were
no
findings
by
the
trial
court
to
that
effect,
as
contrasted
with,
for
example,
the
state
of
colorado
case--
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
--well,
that's
one
of
the--
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
--in
the
record,
your
honor,
i
believe
there
is
some
testimony
from
a
defense
expert,
with
which
we
would
not
agree
by
any
means,
suggesting
that
you
could
capture
it
with
an
indium
tube
or
with
silica
gel.
the
indium
tube
does
capture
true
air.
the
silica
gel
simply
absorbs
alcohol,
does
not
capture
true
air.
now,
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
that
as
far
as
the
intoxolizer
itself
is
concerned,
the
machine
that
we
use,
by
choice,
there
is
no
device
approved
or
available
that
you
can
attach
to
that
machine
to
capture
the
air.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
your
honor.
you
could
capture
the
air
with
a
different
machine,
but
then
that
means
a
different
sample.
and
it
is
our
position
that
you
have
an
apple
and
an
orange,
and
one
is
not
the
same
fruit.
for
a
proceeding
to
be
fair,
due
process
does
not
require
anything
more
than
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
challenge
the
state's
evidence.
this
in
turn
depends
in
part
upon
the
nature
of
the
evidence
actually
presented.
there
is
no
doubt
that
preservation
of
a
substance
scientifically
tested,
if
reliable
preservation
is
both
possible
and
practical,
would
be
ideal.
as
i
have
said,
it
would
make
the
state's
job
a
lot
easier
by
removing
any
possibility
of
doubt
and
giving
us
a
stronger
case,
but
frankly,
we
don't
believe
this
practical
or
possible
at
the
present
time.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
because
due
process
and
fair
trial
does
not
require
only
one
kind
of
procedure.
as
long
as
any
alternative
gives
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
state's
case,
due
process
is
satisfied.
that
some
may
consider
one
procedure
preferable
to
another
is
not
a
constitutional
dimension.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
that
has
been
the
traditional
rule
in
this
country,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
well,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
what
process
is
due,
what
is
fair.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
certainly.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
when
physical
evidence
is
lost
or
destroyed,
it
is
true
that
the
defendant
can
no
longer
see
it
for
himself,
but
neither
can
the
jury,
and
the
absence
of
the
physical
proof
both
diminishes
the
weight
of
the
state's
case
and
exposes
it
to
doubts
arising
from
the
loss.
with
scientific
tests,
the
defendant
can
still
explore
the
competence
of
the
expert,
acceptability
of
the
methodology,
and
adequacy
of
the
equipment
to
challenge
the
test
validity,
and
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
state
cannot
remove
all
possibility
of
doubt
by
presenting
the
physical
evidence
itself,
the
defendant
has
even
greater
latitude
in
creating
reasonable
doubt
than
perhaps
existed
before.
now,
there
are
additional
protections
with
evidential
breath
test
instruments
like
the
intoxolizer.
in
california,
extensive
studies
are
done
by
the
department
of
health
on
each
machine.
these
are
matters
of
public
record.
a
record
is
kept
of
all
periodic
calibration
checks
of
the
instrument
in
question.
the
defendant's
own
test
record
is
preserved
recording
the
circumstances
of
the
test.
the
instrument
itself
remains
available
for
testing,
and
the
instrument
operator
is
available
for
cross
examination.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is
part
of
the
permanent
record.
you
can
always
tie
the
machine
to
the
particular
test.
this
gives
the
defendant
ample
opportunity
to
probe
the
accuracy
of
the
test.
it
is
an
acceptable
alternative
to
sample
preservation
and
assures
a
fair
trial.
but
there
is
still
a
second
alternative
suitable
for
purposes
of
due
process.
under
california
law,
a
suspect
has
a
right
to
have
his
own
sample
collected,
independently
tested,
and
can
use
the
results
to
challenge
the
state's
case.
the
availability
of
this
alternative,
which
has
existed
for
years,
is
also
adequate
for
this
purpose.
now,
trombetta
goes
even
farther
than
the
hitch
case
by
requiring
if
not
preservation,
collection
of
an
equivalent
sample
for
use
of
the
defendant.
this
goes
beyond
anything
any
court
has
required
before.
this
imposes
an
affirmative
duty
to
collect
something
the
police
did
not
themselves
use
or
need.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
these
machines
can
be
commonly
purchased
by
anyone,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
number
of
private
laboratories
own
them.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
this
particular
machine
costs
$4,000.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
now,
the
average
person
obviously
is
not
going
to
go
out
and
buy
one,
but
he
has
access
to
them
through
private
laboratories
and
the
courts
permit
him
to
have
access
to
the
particular
machine
that
he
was
tested
on.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
i
would
not
hazard
to
guess
that,
your
honor,
at
all,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
he
gets
into
court
he
will
know
that
he
can
go
and
test
that
machine
if
he
wishes.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
correct.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
in
my
view,
that
is
a
state
requirement.
the
statute
has
existed
for
a
number
of
years,
and
the
cases
in
california
interpreted
this
particular
statute
as
giving
the
person
an
absolute
right
but
not
imposing
on
the
officer
a
duty
admonition.
that
is,
at
least
until
recent
enactment
of
a
new
statute
to
attempt
to
combat
trombetta,
was
the
case.
now,
of
course,
the
officer
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
do
it.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
oh,
no.
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
the
majority
opinion
has
nothing
to
do
with
an
admonition
at
all.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
it
strictly
says
that
you
must
preserve
a
sample,
and
because
you
didn't
in
this
case,
that
violates
due
process
and
the
evidence
must
be
excluded.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
an
admonition.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
no.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
incorrect.
the
officers
did
not
violate
state
law.
there
was
no
requirement
to
admonish
them
under
state
law.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
and
i
do
not
believe
the
concurring
opinion
says
that.
what
the
concurring
opinion
suggests
is
that
a
way
to
avoid
the
problem
would
be
to
admonish
the
suspect
and
get
a
waiver.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
this
is
what
the
concurring
opinion
does,
but
that
was
not
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time,
and
the
decision
does
not
rest
on
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
now,
the
additional
part
of
trombetta,
the
collection
part,
casts
the
state
in
the
role
of
an
agent
for
the
defense,
and
causes
a
serious
distortion
of
the
adversary
process,
and
an
incredible
tension
between
competing
interests
and
duties
on
the
part
of
the
officer.
now,
we
submit
that
trombetta
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
r.b.
kirk
no,
your
honor,
i
don't,
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
