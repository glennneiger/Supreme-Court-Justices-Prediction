unknown
speaker
mr.
kirk,
how
widespread
is
the
use
of
the
intoxolizer
around
the
country?
unknown
speaker
general
kirk,
would
you
just
help
me
out
on
one
thing?
i
may
have
gotten
the
wrong
impression.
i
thought
from
the
material
at
the
beginning
of
your
opponent's
brief
that
there
was
another
breath
testing
device
that
did
conserve
the
sample,
and
that
was
permissible
to
use
in
california.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
but
it
isn't
widely
used--
unknown
speaker
--in
california?
unknown
speaker
general
kirk,
may
i
just
ask
this?
supposing
you
had
taken
a
blood
sample
instead
of
the
breath
sample.
do
you
think
the
officer
could
have
thrown
it
away
without
raising
any
questions?
unknown
speaker
supposing
that
was
done,
and
after
they
got
through
they
just
threw
it
away,
they
just
made
a
record
of
it.
would
that
raise
any
questions
for
you?
unknown
speaker
just
a
matter
of
credibility--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
another
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
if
the
two
different
procedures,
one
of
which
was
that
you
could
preserve
the
sample
and
the
other
of
which,
the
one
you
actually
used,
were
equally
costly
to
the
state,
there
is
just
no
different,
you
just
chose...
you
just
elected
to
have
the
one
that
you
are
using
rather
than
the
other
one,
would
that
present
any
problem?
unknown
speaker
the
question
i
am
really
getting
up
to
is,
why
don't
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
they
do
this
in
colorado,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
how
long
would
blood
remain
in
a
static
condition
so
that
it
could
be
tested
and
retested
weeks
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
stored,
but
it
must
be
refrigerated,
must
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
about
five
days
of
tests
as
to
what
the
preservatives
due
to
it.
unknown
speaker
don't
you?
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
this
your
own
idea,
or
are
you
quoting
from
something?
unknown
speaker
general,
is
there
any
procedure
for
keeping
this
air?
unknown
speaker
no
evidence
was
produced
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
know
how
you
catch
it.
then
i
would
like
to
know
how
you
keep
it.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
here
in
the
record
that
will
help
me
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
can
capture
the
air
with
a
different
machine.
that
is
what
you
told
me,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
you
also
say
it
is
not
required
by
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
this
sounds
to
me
like
a
very
amorphous
concept
you
are
talking
about,
a
fair
opportunity
to
challenge
the
state's
case.
i
mean,
supposing
the
state
has
four
or
five
eye
witnesses,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
have
any
access
to
them
at
all.
now,
is
cross
examination
of
the
eye
witnesses
what
you
would
call
a
fair
opportunity
to
challenge?
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
see
how
a
vague
phrase
like
"a
fair
opportunity
to
challenge"
moves
the
ball
much
in
this
rather
particular
situation,
where
we
are
talking
about,
i
take
it,
whether
brady
against
maryland
should
be
extended.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
have
to
start
all
over
with
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
every
case
we
hear
argued.
i
mean,
we
are
focusing
in
the
general
area
of
brady
against
maryland,
aren't
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
your
case
to
argue.
unknown
speaker
is
each
report
in
some
way
coated
so
that
the
identification
number
of
the
particular
machine
as
well
as
the
operator
is
part
of
the
permanent
record?
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
that
these
machines
are
available
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
cost
around
$2,200.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
the
average
person
knows
that?
unknown
speaker
the
average
person
knows
that?
unknown
speaker
general
kirk,
can
i
ask
you
a
question--
unknown
speaker
--on
that
procedure?
the
california
court,
as
i
understand
it,
went
beyond...
you
just
made
this
point...
went
beyond
the
hitch
case
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--and
made
its
new
ruling
just
prospective
only,
and
it
relied
in
part,
at
least
the
concurring
judge
did,
on
the
failure
to
tell
the
arrested
person
that
he
had
a
choice
between
this
procedure
and
the
either
blood
or
urine
sample
as
opposed
to
a
breath
sample.
to
what
extent
does
that
requirement
of
advice
underlie
this
decision?
and
is
that
a
federal
requirement
or
a
state
requirement
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
the
case,
is
it
not
possible
that
this
judgment,
at
least
insofar
as
the
particular
people
before
the
court
are
concerned,
rests
on
the
state
ground
that
they
failed
to
give
the
advice
required
by
state
law?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
is
what
the
majority
opinion
says,
but
it
is
true
that
the
officers
did
also
violate
state
law
in
a
way
set
forth
in
the
concurring
opinion.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
would
you
find
it
constitutionally
objectionable
if
the
officers
were
trained
to
take
a
blood
test
and...
take
a
blood
test
right
on
the
scene?
unknown
speaker
do
they
now
take
blood
tests
right
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
out
on
the
road?
unknown
speaker
may
i
stop
you
right
there?
unknown
speaker
does
the
government
destroy
this
evidence,
"destroy"?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
say
it?
you
said
that
they
destroy
it.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
do
a
thing.
that
is
what
you're
complaining
about,
that
they
don't
do
something.
unknown
speaker
you
want
to
put
an
affirmative
duty
on
them,
not
to
stop
them
from
doing
something,
but
to
make
them
do
something.
there
is
a
considerable
difference.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
one
way
he
could
do
that
if
he
wanted
to
spend
$4,000
to
buy
a
machine
and
carry
it
in
the
car
with
him.
i
suppose
that
would
do
it,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
demeo--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
it
impractical
for
someone
who
has
plenty
of
his
own
breath
still
on
his
body
to
preserve
it
for
himself
if
he
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
people
who
are
arrested
for
dwi
often
resort
to
their
own
requested
blood
samples
or
breath
tests.
you
can
do
that
independently.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
that
the
government
had
the
means
to
do
it
and
it
is
simple
certainly
does
not
mean
it
is
constitutionally
required.
i
don't
think
any
of
our
cases
say
that.
i
mean,
you
are
talking
about
it
would
be
nice
for
the
government
to
do
it.
perhaps
it
would.
but
that
doesn't
mean
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
it
is
constitutional
then?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
if
it
is
vital...
it
may
be
vital
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
would
be
a
good
deal
better
off
if
the
government
did
go
to
this
extra
expense,
but
that
still
doesn't
make
it
a
constitutional
requirement.
is
brady
the
closest
case
you
have
to
support
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
agers
is
just
talking
about
the
duty
to
turn
over
exculpatory
evidence
which
is
in
existence.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
any
duty
to
preserve,
nor
does
brady.
unknown
speaker
then
the
answer
is,
you
are
not
covered
by
brady
and
you
are
not
covered
by
agers,
because
those
cases
dealt
with
when
evidence
was
in
existence.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
is
the
holding
of
agers,
what
is
the
holding
of
brady.
both
of
them
hold
where
the
evidence
is
in
existence,
you
must
turn
it
over.
you
say
here
it
wasn't
in
existence
as
if
that
automatically
calls
for
some
extension.
that
is
simply
a
different
fact
situation.
it
wasn't
confronted
in
brady.
it
wasn't
confronted
in
agers.
unknown
speaker
let's
test
that.
you
blow
into
the
machine.
unknown
speaker
and
it
registers
numbers,
right?
by
the
time
it
registers
the
final
number,
where
is
the
air?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
air?
unknown
speaker
no,
sir,
it
has
gone
out
of
the
machine.
unknown
speaker
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
purge
what
is
left
out.
but
the
air
goes--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
air
doesn't
go
through,
how
are
they
going
to
test
it?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
device?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
california.
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
them
to
put
that
on
the
machine.
unknown
speaker
if
they
gave
them
a
blood
test,
you
wouldn't
have
any
of
these
problems,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
so
since
he
chose
one,
the
state
has
to
go
and
preserve
the
air
that
is
gone
or
bring
back
the
air
that
has
gone.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
about
your
view
on
part
of
this
constitutional
question.
it
is
the
infirmity
of
the
evidence
that
troubles
you.
now,
suppose
each
police
car
had
two
or
three
of
these
machines.
they
tested
the
man
once,
and
then
put
that
machine
away,
and
then
waited
two
or
three
minutes,
and
then
tested
him
again,
and
if
necessary
tested
him
on
a
third
machine,
and
if
they
all
agreed,
would
that
meet
your
constitutional
objections?
unknown
speaker
even
if
all
of
the
machines
agreed
exactly?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
even
if
this
machine
were
wrong
only
once
in
a
million
times,
the
fact
that
it
might
be
wrong
only
that
seldom
should
nevertheless
result
in
giving
the
defense
the
opportunity
to
ferret
out
that
one
in
a
million?
unknown
speaker
because
i
don't
see
any
claims
by
you
or
any
evidence
or
any
statistical
presentation
that
would
indicate
how
often
these
results
might
be
erroneous.
unknown
speaker
is
the
machine
that
produces
this
evidence,
makes
this
reading,
will
it
be
in
the
same
condition
when
the
trial
occurs
as
it
was
when
the
test
was
taken?
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
call
these
witnesses,
criminalists?
or
criminologists?
what
do
you
call
them?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
the
dictionary?
i
guess
it
must
be.
unknown
speaker
what
are
they
experts
in?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
my
problem
is,
you
say
that
you
want
to
preserve
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
is
in
your
client,
his
breath.
why
couldn't
he
preserve
his
own
breath?
unknown
speaker
is
he
going
to
get
the
instruments
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
good
is
it
if
he
doesn't
have
instruments?
unknown
speaker
what
good
is
it
if
he
doesn't
have
instruments?
unknown
speaker
it
is
because
it
is
cheaper
for
the
government
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
was
it
there
where
this
man
was?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
need
to
know?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
are
now
down
to
saying
that
the
government
can
do
it
better
than
you
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
did.
they
made
the
test.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
do...
then
the
government
has
to
make
another
test.
right?
unknown
speaker
and
to
preserve
it
and
test
it
over
and
over
again.
unknown
speaker
how
could
they
be
sure
it
is
right?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
in
the
constitution
says
that
because
the
government
can
do
it
better
than
the
defendant,
the
government
must
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
for
one...
i
resent
talking
about
the
constitution
as
saying
it
seems.
the
constitution
either
does
or
it
does
not.
do
you
agree
with
me
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
give
up
the
"seems".
unknown
speaker
once
the
police
have
stopped
the
car
with
a
suspicion
that
the
driver
is
intoxicated
and
they
have
taken
this
breathylizer
test
once,
can
they
use
that
machine
again
without...
can
they
test
the
next
drunken
driver
they
meet
and
still
preserve
the
material
of
the
first
one?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
would
that
enable
them...
my
question
is,
again,
would
that
enable
them
to
use
that
same
machine
on
the
next
drunken
driver,
and
the
next
one,
and
the
next
one,
that
same
machine?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
same
evening,
without
discharging
some
of
the
materials?
unknown
speaker
how
can
they
preserve
it
if
they
purge
it?
unknown
speaker
to
in
effect
a
different
machine
from
the
one
they
are
using
now.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
breath
was
preserved,
like
you
would
like
to
have.
what
would
you
do
with
it?
unknown
speaker
how
accurate
is
that
machine,
though,
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
and
so
if
it
happened
to
test
and
it
was
inaccurate,
as
you
say
it
can
be,
where
would
you
be?
unknown
speaker
in
a
battle
of
experts.
unknown
speaker
and
also
of--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
jury
or
whoever
is
trying
the
case
weighing
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
officer
examining,
if
he
ever
smells
the
fellow's
breath,
can
hardly
save
the
sample,
and
yet
that
evidence
is
freely
admissible.
unknown
speaker
did
he
smell?
yes,
he
smelled.
how
do
you
know
he
smelled?
well,
i
just
smelled
him.
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
awfully
sorry
i
didn't
save
the
sample.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question
about
the
machine?
unknown
speaker
does
the...
i
am
not
quite
clear.
even
though
the
sample
itself
was
not
saved,
does
the
machine
record
in
some
way
what
the
results
of
the
test
were?
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
really
have
an
issue
that
maybe
the
officer
made
a
mistake,
or
contrived
testimony.
that
problem
isn't
present
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
there
is
an
accurate...
normally,
at
least,
in
the
normal
routine,
there
would
be
an
accurate
record
made
of
what
this
device
actually
showed
at
the
time
the
test
was
made?
unknown
speaker
is
that
fundamentally
any
different
from
an
electrocardiogram
after
it
comes
out
of
the
machine?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
go
back
and
capture
the
heartbeat.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
paper
recording
of
it.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
is
this
fundamentally
different
from
the
cardiogram
recording?
unknown
speaker
mr.
demeo,
you
are
relying
primarily
on
the
brady
case
and
the
agers
case
as
the
source
of
this
right
that
you
assert
for
your
client?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
they
presumably
are
relying
in
turn
on
these
federal
cases
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
it
primarily
the
non-disclosure
of
evidence
known
only
to
the
prosecutor
that
brady
and
agers
say
makes
the
trial
unfair?
isn't
that
the
focus
really
of
those
cases
and
what
is
behind
them?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
non-disclosure
of
something
known
only
to
the
prosecutor.
now,
here
you
have
something
that
is
known
as
much
to
the
defense,
the
defendant,
as
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
officers.
you
don't
have
a
problem
of
non-disclosure
of
evidence
known
only
to
the
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
our
cases
haven't...
or
the
cases
of
this
court
haven't
gone
so
far
as
to
say
the
constitution
is
violated
if
in
some
unforeseen
fashion
evidence
might
be
lost.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
they
even
well,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
what
case
from
this
court
requires
an
earnest
effort
to
preserve?
unknown
speaker
but
augenblick
was
a
ruling
for
the
government,
and
the
fact
that
it
may
say
in
this

been

well,
he
had
that
opportunity.

opportunity
from

was
arrested

was
convicted.

mr.
demeo,
that
statute
raised
the
question
in
my
mind
as
to
what...
if
that
satisfied
the
holding
in
the
trombetta
case,
there
is
no
obligation
to
preserve
the
sample.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
an
obligation
to
give
notice.
that
is
what--
unknown
speaker
--right,
but
if
the
california
legislature
correctly
understood
trombetta,
all
that
case
holds
is
that
you've
got
to
give
notice.
that
is
why
i
asked
your
opponent
earlier
whether
we
really
had
a
federal
issue
here.
unknown
speaker
and
they
say...
the
california
legislature
apparently
thought
that
solved
the
whole
problem,
didn't
they?
