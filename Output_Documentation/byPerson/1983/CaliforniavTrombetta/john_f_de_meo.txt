mr.
john
f.
de
meo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
argues
for
a
rule
on
the
due
process
duty
to
preserve
which
in
the
final
analysis
would
permit
law
enforcement
to
choose
unilaterally
methods
of
testing
which
in
effect
would
use
up
or
consume
or
discard
or
destroy
the
evidence
which
is
vital
on
the
issue
of
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
an
accused
in
the
driving
under
the
influence
case.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
would
not,
your
honor.
the
law
in
california
at
least
at
this
time
in
the
case
of
the
collection
of
blood
does
provide
for
the
retention
for
a
year,
and
provides
that
the
defendant
may
have
a
sample
for
retesting
so
that
would
certainly
give
him
the
right
to
have
a
retest.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
it
requires
someone
who
is
properly
trained
to
do
that
in
the
medical
discipline.
in
the
event
that
the
government
does
utilize
a
device
which
does
destroy
the
evidence,
and
if
that
evidence,
the
result
of
it
is
inculpatory,
then
california
argues
that
it
should
be
entitled
to
introduce
that
evidence
on
the
issue
of
guilt
of
the
defendant--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
in
effect,
that's
what
happens,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
they--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--they
don't
preserve.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
your
honor,
what
i
do
want
them
to
do
is,
when
they
embark
upon
the
process
of
a
collection
of
evidence
which
bears
directly
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused,
i
want
them
then
in
that
case
to
be
sure
that
they
preserve
a
sample
of
that
evidence
or
its
equivalent
so
that
the
defendant
on
the
trial
is
not
placed
in
the
position
where
he
must
only
be
permitted
to
cross
examine
the
machine
that
was
used
or
a
piece
of
paper
where
the
results
of
the
test
are
reported
to
cross
examine
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
connected
up
or
not
with
this
defendant,
or
perhaps
there
was
an
error,
or
whether
or
not
in
effect
the
expert
who
is
testifying
may
not
have
made
an
error
in
calibrating
the
machine.
i
think
that
for
a
fair
trial
for
a
defendant
accused
of
this
type
of
a
crime,
he
must
be
armed
with
the
same
type
of
artillery
as
the
prosecution
has.
namely,
he
must
be
entitled
to
retest
that
evidence.
why
should
he
have
to
rely
on
what
the
government
says
the
result
is?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
would.
it
would
present
a
rather
impractical
approach,
i
would
say,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
excellent,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
you
can,
your
honor.
the
problem
with
that
is,
and
the
problem
with
california
vehicle
code
section
13.354(b),
which
does
say
that
a
defendant
who
is
arrested
for
driving
under
the
influence
may
request
a
blood,
breath,
or
urine
test,
the
problem
is
that
although
we
are
all
presumed
to
know
the
law,
it
is
folly
to
assume
that
most
people
are
aware
of
that
right,
and
the
other
part
of
it
is
that
when
you
are
under
the
stress
of
an
arrest,
usually
down
at
a
jailhouse
where
you
are
incarcerated,
it
is
difficult
to
arrange
for
an
expert
to
come
out
to
give
you
a
test.
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
that
arise
with
that.
and
certainly
i
would
like
to
make
this
point,
that
government
is
in
a
superior
position
with
its
resources.
i
often
hear
the
question
asked,
why
does
government
have
to
do
everything?
but
in
this
instance
they
have
the
resources
to
preserve,
and
the
timeliness
of
the
preservation
of
that
sample
is
so
important
to
its
reliability
subsequently
that
by
the
time
that
one
might
arrange
for
a
criminalist
to
come
out
or
a
doctor
to
come
out
to
the
jailhouse
for
the
person
in
distress
to
try
to
look
through
a
telephone
book
and
find
someone,
sometimes
late
at
night,
would
present
a
difficult
obstacle
when,
on
the
other
hand,
government
has
the
means
to
do
it
and
it
is
simple.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
not
nice,
your
honor.
i
say
it
is
vital
to
the
defense
of
the
defendant
in
one
of
these
cases
to
be
entitled
to--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
from
this
court,
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
no,
i
believe
that
the
language
in
agers
would
indicate
that
in
defining
materiality,
that
if
the
evidence
might
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
and--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
the
problem
is,
your
honor,
that
here
there
was
no
evidence
to
preserve.
we
don't
know
if
it
is
exculpatory
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
by
the
same
token,
your
honor,
if
the
evidence
is
destroyed,
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
been
favorable
except
that
in
this
case--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--your
honor,
in
this
case
the
evidence
was
in
existence,
but
by
virtue
of
the
method
that
was
used
to
test
it,
it
left
existence.
it
wasn't--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
is
my
understanding--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--it
is
in
the
machine.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
is
my
understanding,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--that
this
intoxolizer
requires
the
operator
to
push
a
purge
button
to
purge
it
out,
in
the
testimony
of
the
people's
expert.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
inside.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
your
honor,
the
evidence
in
the
case
by
the
criminalist
that
was
produced
by
the
defense
was
that
it
would
stay
in
the
machine
more
than
20
minutes
if
it
was
not
purged
out
of
the
machine,
so
that
they
do
have
it
captured
and
collected,
and
of
course
with
the
silica
gel
device
which
can
be
adapted
to
this
machine,
they
can
capture
that
and
subsequently
test
it.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
is
called
a
silica
gel
tube,
your
honor,
that
fits
on
the
outboard
side
of
the
intoxolizer,
an
adaptation.
that
is
what
they
use
in
colorado.
therefore
it
collects.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
or
i
want
them
to
use
the
indium
proof
crimper
device
to
preserve,
or
i
want
them
to
use
the
equivalent,
which
13.353.5
of
the
vehicle
code
now
provides.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
wouldn't
except
that
the--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--no,
your
honor,
but
you
could
ask
for
another
test.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
or
take
another
substantially
similar
test,
or
its
equivalent,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
thank
you.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
commenting
briefly
on
the
brady
case,
it
is
our
position
that
brady
necessarily
applies
to
the
situation
at
hand,
because
if
brady
only
requires
a
disclosure
of
that
which
is
preserved
in
a
fixed
form
by
law
enforcement,
then
it
seems
that
it
would
be
easy
to
avoid
brady
by
law
enforcement's
use
of
methods
of
testing
material
evidence
which
use
up
or
discard
or
destroy
the
evidence
in
the
process
of
the
test.
therefore,
we
feel
that
it
necessarily
applies
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
if
you
can
unilaterally
use
an
instrument
which
does
away
with
the
evidence
that
is
vital,
then
in
effect
we
believe
that
brady
is
violated.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
really
would
not,
your
honor,
unless
one
of
the
methods
of
preservation
gave
the
defense
the
material
to
test
through
its
own
criminalist
or
referee
analysis.
we
think
that
he
should
have
the
opportunity
of
testing
that
evidence
himself
rather
than
merely
accepting
the--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--even
if
all
the
machines
agreed
exactly,
and
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
i
might
say
that
if
the
defendant
is
accorded
this
right,
which
is
simple
for
law
enforcement
to
do
to
preserve,
that
if
it
does
agree
through
the
defense
criminalist
analysis,
i
think
it
would
have
some
beneficial
effect
on
the
problem
of
persons
who
drive
under
the
influence
and
cause
accidents,
namely,
that
if
they
see
that
they
have
no
way
of
contesting
the
case,
that
there
would
be
less
congestion
of
the
courts,
more
pleas
of
guilty,
and
these
cases
would
be
out
of
the
way.
that
is
a
possible
incidental
benefit
to
society
as
a
result
of
permitting
that
test,
but
we
know--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
if
any
one
person
were
convicted
when
if
he
had
an
opportunity
to
retest
the
evidence
it
would
have
been
exculpatory,
that
the
united
states
does
not
win
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
it
loses.
it
is
the
same
as
the
iglio
case,
the
same
as
the
moody
case,
where
if
there
is
false
evidence
that
caused
a
conviction,
it
would
fall
within
that
ambit.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
not
necessarily.
it
requires
periodic
maintenance.
it
requires
calibration.
there
is
evidence
in
one
of
the
briefs
that
electromagnetic
interference
can
cause
it
to
malfunction,
but
i
think
the
basic
problem
with
it
is
that
it
is
non-specific
for
alcohol.
this
particular
intoxolizer
machine
used
in
these
cases,
as
the
record
shows
in
an
uncontradicted
manner,
that,
and
there
have
been
no
experts
to
counter
the
experts
of
the
defendants,
what
it
means
in
being
non-specific
is
simply
that
other
types
of
properties
cause
this
instrument
to
register
as
alcohol.
for
example,
our
own
body
metabolism
has
acetone.
we
have
it
in
the
blood,
urine,
and
in
the
breath.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
absolutely,
your
honor,
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
murray,
our
criminalist,
and
also
in
three
affidavits
filed
in
the
traverse...
in
the
habeas
corpus--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--criminalists,
i
believe
they
refer
to
themselves
as,
your
honor.
experts.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
think
it
is.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
in
the
analysis
of
body
fluids,
your
honor,
and
in
the
machinery
that
was
used
in
this
case
for
the
testing
of
alcoholic
content
in
the
blood.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
because
he
doesn't
have
the
instruments
to
do
that
at
the
time,
and
if
it
is
not
timely,
it
is
not
helpful.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
not
unless
he
has
the--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--well,
that's
why--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--from
the
standpoint
of
the
constitutional
attack
we
are
making,
it
seems
that
it
is
so
easy
and
simple
and
feasible
for
the
government
to
preserve
that
for
him,
and
that
should
be
weighed
in
the
context
of
whether
it
is
a
constitutional
violation.
it
is
stipulated
to
be
simple
to
preserve.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
is
easier,
because
they
have
the
resources
right
there
at
hand.
in
fact,
we
had
an
instrument
in
california
at
the
time
approved
by
the
department
of
public
health--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
do
know--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--it
was
available
to
the
government.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--to
use
an
earnest
effort
to
preserve.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
not
over
and
over
again,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
just
to
preserve
it
so
that
the
defendant
can
check
the
government's
efforts.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
we
are
saying
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
that,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
because
in
these
cases
it
seems
that
the
superior
ability
and
resources
are
important.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
do,
and
we
contend
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
your
honor.
very
well.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
if
we
are
talking
of
the
intoxolizer,
the
one
that
was
used
in
this
instance--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--from
the
standpoint
of
use
at
the
jailhouse,
the
answer
is
that
the
only
way
they
can
preserve
it
on
that
machine
is
to
apply
what
we
call
the
silica
gel
adapter.
california
has
not
approved
that
yet,
but
colorado
has,
and
our
record
indicates
that
it
is
accurate
to
do
it,
it
is
easy
to
do
it,
and
it
can
be
done,
and
that
the
results--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--oh,
yes.
oh,
yes.
the
intoxolizer
can
be
used
over
and
over
again.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
oh,
it
must
be
purged
first,
of
course.
yes.
the
breath
that
is
within
the
machine
must
be
purged
out
of
it
before
the
next
person
is
tested.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
by
adapting
the
machine
to
a
silicon
gel
tube
that
fits
on
the
outboard
side.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
a
slight
adaptation,
your
honor,
a
very
simple
one,
as
the
record
would
indicate.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
we
would...
i
was
going
to
get
to
that,
and
i
am
glad
we
are
at
that,
your
honor.
there
is
an
instrument
knows
as
a
gas
chromatograph
intoximeter
mark
2
and
mark
4
model
approved
in
california
for
testing
preserved
breath.
this
instrument
is
specific
for
ethanol.
in
other
words,
it
takes
alcohol
and
measures
only
the
alcohol
content
in
the
blood,
and--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--very
accurate.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
our
experts
say
it
is
the
most
accurate
machine
there
is
for
the
testing
of
breath,
and
even
it
has
some
deficiencies,
but
it
is
the
most
accurate
one.
it
is
a
different
principle,
the
gas
chromatograph.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
then
we
would
be--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--in
a
battle
of
experts
and
also--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--demeanor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
and
the
officer's
testimony
as
to
what
the
demeanor
of
the
defendant
was.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
um-hm.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
your
honor.
the
intoxolizer
prints
out
on
a
card.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
no,
not
unless
the
card
was
put
in
someone
else's
file
by
error
or
mislabeled
or
misnumbered,
which
is
always
possible
certainly.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
it
would
normally
print
that
out
on
a
card.
that
is
the
only
thing
that
we
have
to
cross
examine
besides
the
machine
and
the
expert
who
comes
in
and
testifies
as
to
the
result.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
probably
not.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
except
there--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes,
one
is--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--only
scientifically,
your
honor.
the
one
machine
is
an
infrared
type
instrument,
and
the
electrocardiogram,
as
i
understand
it,
works
on
a
different
principle,
but
there
is
a
printout
that
would
be
the
same
principle.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
and
the
california
decisions,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
they
seem
to
be.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
it
is,
because
there
was
something
found
to
be
in
existence
later--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--how
would
that
be
different,
your
honor?
just
to
paraphrase
that,
how
would
that
non-disclosure
be
different
than
just
not
having
the
evidence
when
you
have
the
availability
of
it?
you
embarked
on
the
process
of
collecting
it,
and
you
discarded
it
when
it
could
be
retained
and
could
be
useful
to
a
defendant
if
it
showed
in
fact
through
this
other
more
precise
machine
that
it
was
indeed
a
false
positive.
perhaps
there
was
some
exposure
to
this
individual
who--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--true.
i
think
that
the
cases
only
require
an
earnest
effort
to
preserve,
and
it
is
conceded
in
the
cases
below
and
in
this
record
that--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--excuse
me.
that
there
was
no
effort
at
all
here
to
preserve
even
though--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--i
believe
augenblick
found
an
earnest
effort
to
preserve
tapes
that
were
lost,
and
since
there
was
proof
by,
i
believe,
eight
witnesses
who
testified
that
they
lost
the
tape
of
this
interview
by
an
investigator
of
a
participant
in
a
crime,
that
the
government
showed
that
they
had
made
an
earnest
effort
to
preserve,
and
therefore
the
evidence--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--well,
it
just
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
when
the
very
evidence
itself
is
directly
determinative
of
whether
or
not
a
person
is
guilty,
namely,
this
test,
and
how
high
it
was,
because
it
gives
rise
to
a
presumption
of
guilt
if
it
is
over.10
percent
in
california,
that
it
is
a
small
price
to
pay
in
terms
of
constitutional
requirements
to
allow
that
defendant
the
same
benefit,
the
same
artillery
that
the
government
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
test
is
or
is
not
valid
that
the
government
took,
and
it
just...
the
principle
is
hard
to
articulate,
because
i
think
it
is
fundamental.
i
believe
that
when
you
take
the
bodily
substance
of
an
individual
to
use
against
him,
that
he
at
least
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
check
to
determine
if
that
testing
done
by
the
government
was
or
was
not
accurate.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--no,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry.
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
at
what
point?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
they
both
had
it
at
one
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
once
in
the
machine
and
once
in
the
body.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
he
still
had
his
breath
certainly.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
surely.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
but
let
me
explain,
your
honor,
that
if
that
test
were
taken
on
the
day
of
the
trial
or
a
week
later
or
five
hours
later,
it
would
have
no
relevance
or
materiality
because
of
the
blood
alcohol--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--being
metabolized.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes.
it
is
being
metabolized
through
the
body,
through
the
liver,
the
breathing,
and
the
urine,
and
it
is
gone,
and
it
is
of
no
relevance
after
that
point.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
how
would
he
have
preserved
his
breath
in
jail?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
how?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
because
they
have
the
means
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well,
your
honor,
he
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
borrow
the
government's
machine.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
well--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--pardon?
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
what
california
has
done
in
response
to
this
case.
section
13.353.5
of
the
vehicle
code
was
adopted
in
response
to
trombetta,
and
the
language
of
the
legislature,
"in
order
to
provide
a
constitutional
procedure
for
administering
the
breath
test
in
light
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
in
people
v.
trombetta,
it
is
necessary
that
this
act
take
effect
immediately.
"
and
what
this
act
does,
when
a
person
chooses
the
breath
test
over
the
blood
or
the
urine
test,
law
enforcement
must
tell
him
now,
which
was
one
of
our
points
below,
tell
him
now
that
there
will
be
no
breath
preserved
by
this
particular
instrument
that
is
being
utilized,
but
that
government
will
provide
him
free
of
cost
a
sample
of
his
blood
or
his
urine
which
he
may
subsequently
have
available
to
him
to
be
tested
by
a
referee
or
a
criminalist
or
a
toxicologist
of
his
own
choosing.
so
that
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
left
for
the
court
to
determine.
in
other
words,
would
this
be
just
a
case
of
isolated...
case
that
would
only
be
isolated
to
the--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--well,
there
is.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
yes,
that's
correct.
they
could
make
a
knowledgeable
waiver
or
take
the
test,
another
test,
so
that--
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
--yes.
mr.
john
f.
de
meo
they
did
believe
that,
your
honor.
they
said
either
we
will
give
you
the
equivalent
or
you
can
waive
it,
one
of
the
two.
at
least
you
are
put
on
notice
of
that
effect.
thank
you
very
much.
