justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question,
if
i
may,
or
perhaps
two
more.
in
the
civil
side
of
this,
and
following...
if
there
had
been
audits,
and
i
guess
there
really
wasn't
as
close
supervision
as
this...
of
this
particular
operation
as
hud
might
well
have
had,
but
if
there
were,
and
they
wanted
to
get
the
money
back,
would
they
have
a
right
of
recovery
from
either
the
city
or
uni,
or
is
their
only
remedy
against
the
individuals
who
were
bribed?
