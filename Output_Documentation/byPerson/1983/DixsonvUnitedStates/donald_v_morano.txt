mr.
donald
v.
morano
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
petitioners
as
employees
of
a
community-based,
non-profit
corporation,
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
uni,
constituted
public
officials
according
to
the
bribery
statute.
since
petitioners
in
their
employment
with
united
neighborhood,
incorporated,
were
not
federal
employees,
the
only
provision
under
which
they
could
be
subject
to
the
bribery
statute
would
be
as
"persons
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
or
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government
thereof,
in
any
official
function,
under
or
by
the
authority
of
any
department
or
agency
or
branch
of
the
government.
"
the
legislative
history
establishes,
however,
that
petitioners
cannot
be
subject
to
the
bribery
statute
under
this
provision.
first,
as
employees
of
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
they
were
not
officers
or
persons
acting
on
behalf
of
a
corporation
controlled
by
a
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government.
second,
petitioners
did
not
have
contracts
with
a
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government,
and
therefore
could
not
serve
as
agents
in
performing
the
terms.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
the
contract
was
between
the
city
of
peoria
and
the
united
states
government.
the
contract
was
a
community
block
grant,
which
was
issued
in
1978
to
the
city
of
peoria,
and
petitioners
were
employees
of
a
subgrantee,
this
non-profit
corporation,
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated.
third
and
last,
petitioners
were
not
federal
inspectors
licensed
or
authorized
by
some
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government
to
certify
or
enforce
standards
established
by
law.
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
bribery
statute,
in
1962,
the
last
time
the
bribery
statute
was
revised,
congress
said
that
it
was
not
making
any
substantive
changes
in
the
statute
in
regard
to
classes
of
persons
subject
to
it,
but
merely
was
consolidating
under
one
statute
what
had
heretofore
been
13
different
statutes.
but
congress
also
declared
that
it
was
continuing
to
give
the
same
broad
interpretation
of
public
official
and
public
act
as
found
in
case
law.
congress,
however,
had
been
prodded
by
the
court
in
this
court's
1920
decision,
united
states
versus
strang,
to
make
the
bribery
statute
applicable
in
piecemeal
fashion
to
employees
of
government
owned
and
controlled
corporations,
such
as,
for
instance,
the
homeowners
loan
corporation
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
and
then,
in
the
year
1948,
congress
revised
the
statute
and
inserted
"or
any
department
or
agency
thereof.
"
to
embrace
offices
or
persons
acting
on
behalf
of
any
independent
agencies
or
government
owned
or
controlled
corporation.
i
think
two
good
examples
of
government
owned
or
controlled
corporations
would
be
the
federal
reserve
banks
which
are
depositories
for
currencies
held
in
the
united
states
treasury,
and
also
fiscal
and
monetary
agents
of
the
united
states,
and
another
example
would
be
the
european
exchange
system,
which
served
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
government
and
the
department
of
the
army
in
operating
exchanges
at
european
military
posts.
thus,
what
we
can
infer
from
these
examples
is
that
a
necessary
condition
of
such
a
government
controlled
corporation
is
that
a
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government
exercise
an
ongoing
control,
supervision,
and
direction
of
the
operation
of
the
corporation.
there
is
a
symbiotic
relationship
between
the
corporation
which
is
controlled
and
the
federal
government.
one
of
the
definitions
given
in
webster's
third
international
dictionary
of
the
noun
"control",
i
think,
specifies
rather
aptly
the
kind
of
control
which
i
am
talking
about:
"application
of
policies
and
procedures
for
directing,
regulating,
and
coordinating
production,
administration,
and
other
business
activities
in
a
way
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
enterprise.
"
accordingly,
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
was
not
a
corporation
controlled
by
the
federal
government.
indeed,
the
program
manager
of
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
for
western
illinois
in
charge
of
the
dispersal
of
the
community
development
block
grants
to
the
city
of
peoria
during
the
period
of
the
indictment
testified
that
he
neither
knew
or
was
required
to
know
the
existence
of
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
nor,
for
that
matter,
any
other
subgrantee.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes.
what
i
have
argued,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
in
effect
there
really
are
three
rubrics
under
which
someone
could
be
deemed
to
act
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
terms
of
legislative
history
and
case
law
which
was
given
approbation
by
the
congress
in
its
1962
statement.
and
the
three
rubrics
are
that
you
have
an
officer
or
employee
of
a
government
controlled
corporation,
or--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--but,
see,
these
are...
we
are
talking
about
actual
government
bodies
in
government
or
any
agency
or
branch
of
the
government
thereof,
but
these
are--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--this
one
is
acting
on
behalf
of
these,
you
see.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes,
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
i
think
i
would
put
it
in
the...
perhaps
in
the...
i
should
perhaps
state
it
in
the
disjunctive
then,
that...
i
can't
think
offhand
of
an
example
in
which
a
person
would
be
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
unless
they
were
some
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
government
involved.
i
mean,
it
is--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--but
i
think
that
the
grain
inspector,
wouldn't
the
grain
inspector
be
acting
for
the
agriculture
department?
i
think
the
grain
inspector
is
authorized
or
licensed
by
the
agriculture
department.
anyway,
i
would
concede
that
it
could
be
understood
in
the
disjunctive,
certainly,
that
it
could
be
acting
on
the
behalf
of
the
united
states
or
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
government,
but
still,
the
three
rubrics
would
be
covered
by
that,
whether
you
understood
it
as
in
the
disjunctive
or
merely
suplisage.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
it
had
no
relationship
whatsoever
with
the
federal
government
save
for
the
federal
source
of
the
funds.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
it
did
all
of
the
rehabilitation
work.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
it
did
all
of
the
rehabilitation
work
for
that
area
of
the
city.
uni
had
been
established
in
1975
with
these
independent
objectives
as
a
community-based
organization
to
improve
the
situation.
when
the
nixon
administration
in
1974
passed
the
community
block
grant
in
response
to
the
turmoil
and
the
lack
of
decent
housing
and
the
lack
of
other
sources
of
finances
to
improve
this
condition,
the
uni...
they
received
more
than
$1
million,
the
city
of
peoria
received
more
than
$1
million
in
grants
specifically
earmarked
to
work
in
that
area,
and
then
they
subcontracted
the
work
out.
all
the
objectives
and
goals
were
general
goals
of
the
city,
but
uni
was
to
use
its
own
ingenuity
in
accomplishing
them.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
yes.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
they
did
have
volunteers,
though.
they
did...
in
other
words,
a
community-based
organization,
and
so
that
they
did
have
housing
contracts--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--but
this
wasn't...
you
see,
there
were
volunteers,
community-based
volunteers,
and
there
were
other
things
which--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--uni
continued
to
carry
on
all
kinds
of
activities.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
didn't
understand
justice
o'connor's
question.
granted
the
city
of
peoria
was
required
to
submit
annual
reports
to
hud,
and
the
secretary
of
hud
had
the
right
to
audit
such
community
block
grants
and
to
adjust,
reduce,
or
withdraw
such
funds
if
the
city
did
not
substantially
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
application
of
the
requirements
of
the
act.
but
according
to
the
act,
once
the
city
of
peoria
had
received
this
community
block
grant,
the
entire
administration
of
the
grant
was
left
to
it,
and
hud
had
absolutely
no
control
over
or
right
to
interfere
with
its
administration.
so
therefore
what
is
decisive
is
that
the
federal
government
had
relinquished
all
control
over
the
operation
and
administration
of
these
community
block
grants
once
it
had
dispersed
them
to
the
city.
a
fortiori,
the
city
of
peoria
in
the
five
contracts
it
entered
into
in
the
year
1978
with
uni
gave
to
uni
full
control
over
the
administration
of
this
one...
of
these
more
than
$1
million
it
had
received
in
community
block
grants
to
rehabilitate
an
area
of
the
city
in
which
uni
had
been
carrying
on
its
activities.
it
retained
only
the
right
to
terminate
the
agreements,
and
to
seek
other
relief
if
uni
failed
to
comply
with
the
municipal
code,
the
city
fair
employment
practices,
and
the
terms
of
the
contracts.
consequently,
uni
was
twice
removed
from
being
a
corporation
controlled
by
the
united
states
government
or
by
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
government
thereof.
in
all
but
two
cases
in
which
persons
who
were
not
federal
employees
or
employees
of
a
government
owned
or
controlled
corporation
were
still
adjudged
public
officials
under
the
statute,
either
they
had
a
contractual
relationship
with
some...
with
the
united
states
and,
i
would
say,
with
some
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government,
in
which
they
served
as
federal
agents,
or
they
served
as
federal
inspectors.
the
only
exceptions
are
the
decisions
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
instant
case
and
in
united
states
versus
mosley.
petitioners
in
their
employment
with
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
had
no
contract
with
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
federal
government
or
the
united
states
of
america,
nor
were
they
agents
of
the
federal
government
inasmuch
as
they
had
no
direct
dealings
with
the
city
of
peoria,
let
alone
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
there
might
be
a
problem
of...
i
mean,
the...
i
haven't
thought
that
through,
but
my
guess
might
be
that
there
might
be
a
problem
between
of
the...
a
dispute
between
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
of
the
government
that
this
is...
this
sounds
a
little
bit
maybe
too
socialistic
for
the
usual
way
in
which
congress
operates.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
act
shows
that
this
would
be
giving
too
broad
a
scope
to
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
certainly
the
united
states
had
an
interest,
the
united
states
had
given
funds,
but
if
we
look
at
the
community
development
act
of
1974,
which
was
a
continuation
of
the
federal
revenue
sharing
programs
for
better
communities
that
nixon
had
initiated
and
the
congress
had
gone
along
with
him
on,
congress
found
critical
problems
facing
the
cities
which
it
hoped
to
alleviate
by
enlisting
the
support
of
the
local
groups.
the
emphasis
was
upon
the
initiative
of
the
community
to
tailor
a
program
which
was
suitable
for
it
in
its
unique
situation.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes,
justice,
it
was
entirely
paid
for
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
i
don't
think,
justice
burger,
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
of
these
words,
that
we
should
give
such
a
broad
construction--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--that's
true,
justice.
i
do
not
think
that
the...
that
use
of
language
on
behalf
of
someone
suggests...
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
someone
has
an
interest
in
the
results,
and
that
someone
is
paying
for
what
is
being
done.
the
statute
says
clearly
that
what
is
anticipated
is
the
consolidated
efforts
of
city,
state,
and
local
governmental
bodies,
the
continuation
of
business
investments,
et
cetera,
so
that
the
"on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
"
if
we
gave
this
strong
interpretation,
any
time
we
had
federal
funds...
excuse
me?
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes,
there
would,
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
as
i
have
tried
to
delineate
with
these
government
controlled
corporations,
uni
does
not
qualify
as
a
government
controlled
corporation;
however,
audits
were
regularly
allowed
by
the
secretary
of
hud,
and
if
there
is
a
misuse
of
the
funds,
then
funds
can
be
adjusted,
withdrawn,
or
reduced
in
terms
of
this
information.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
not
unless
there
is
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
they
couldn't
be
prosecuted
under
the
bribery
statute,
because
the
bribery
statute
doesn't
cover
them,
because--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--i
don't
know
what
law
it
would
or
would
not
be
covered
under.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
no,
within
the
scope
of
the...
they
have
a
contract
with
the
city
of
peoria,
and
they
were
subject
to
an
audit
by
the
city
of
peoria--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--and
if
they
didn't
conform,
they
were
subject
to
prosecution
under
any
existing
law.
the
only
contention--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--they
had
the
right
to--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--yes.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
it
was
given
by
the
statute,
the
community
block
grant.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
i
think
that
we
can
analogize
with
income
tax.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--i
think
i
do.
would
you
please
repeat
it?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
well,
i
think
that
certainly...
i
think
the
emphasis
has
been
too
much
upon
the
federal
source
of
the
community
block
grants
and
the
perduring
interests
of
congress
in
these,
but
when
it
comes
to
a
criminal
statute,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity,
and
i
maintain
that
there
is
ambiguity
in
what
it
means
to
act
on
behalf
of
someone
else,
that
if
we
were
to
say
that
any
time
one
handles
funds
that
have
been
derived
from
someone
else,
that
one
is
acting
on
behalf
of
that
government
body,
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
have
an
almost
limited
jurisdiction,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
congress
had
intended.
so
that
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we...
to
understand
a
plain
meaning,
we
not
only
have
to
construe
the
words
"acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
any
official
function.
"
but
we
also
have
to
look
to
a
further
restriction,
and
the
further
restriction
is
under
or
by
authority
of
some
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
the
government
thereof.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is...
it
would
be
rather
far-fetched
to
say
that
these
employees
who
were
doing
day
to
day
tasks
assigned
to
them
by
their
superiors
in
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
are
acting
under
or
by
the
authority
of
hud,
or
under
or
by
authority
of
the
city
of
peoria,
let
alone
hud.
the
congress,
when
it
drafted
the
statute,
didn't
predicate
the
statute
in
terms
of
the
source
of
the
funds.
in
the
government
brief,
they--
mr.
donald
v.
morano
--i
would
think
so,
but
i
wonder
if
it
makes
any
difference
in
this
case,
because
obviously
if
these
people
were
acting
on
behalf
of...
if
they
were
public
officials,
they
would
be
so
because
of
the
connection
through
hud,
and
so
therefore
it
is
a
department
of
the
federal
government,
and
therefore,
if
they
are
going
to
be
public
officials,
it
would
be
under
or
by
authority
of
the
department
of
hud.
and
this
is
not,
it
seems
to
me,
what
is
the
case
here.
i
think
that
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
congress
could
have
expressed
more
vividly
its
intention
to
cover
persons
administering
federal
programs,
and
i
think
in
the
very
posing
of
the
question
it
answers
itself,
for
if
congress
had
intended
that
there
be
federal
jurisdiction
under
the
bribery
statute
for
all
cases
of
alleged
fraud
by
persons
administering
federally
funded
programs,
all
it
would
have
had
to
have
done
would
have
been
to
have
drafted
a
statute
stating
just
that.
but
it
didn't
do
such.
it
seems
that
the
principle
of
lenity
and
the
principle
of
federalism
adds
strength
to
this
position.
the
principle
of
lenity
that
in
a
criminal
statute,
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
whatsoever,
if
there
is
genuine
ambiguity...
i
shouldn't
say
any
ambiguity
whatsoever...
but
if
there
is
a
genuine
ambiguity,
the
narrower
construction
is
mandated,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
one
can
say
is
that
there
is
some
doubt
about
congressional
intent
about
the
language.
and
therefore
the
narrower
construction
seems
mandated.
in
addition,
since
we
have
here
not
merely
a
criminal
statute
but
a
federal
criminal
statute,
we
also
have
problems
of
comity
and
federalism,
that
the
area
of
criminal
law
is
generally,
absent
a
national
or
constitutional
issue,
left
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states.
mr.
donald
v.
morano
i
am
sorry.
is
my
time
off?
mr.
donald
v.
morano
have
i
looked
at
the
statute?
mr.
donald
v.
morano
yes.
thank
you.
