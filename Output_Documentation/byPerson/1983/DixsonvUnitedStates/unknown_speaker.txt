unknown
speaker
did
their
agency,
the
local
agency
have
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morano,
is
this
argument
directed
to
the
phrase
in
the
statute
"a
person
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states?
"
unknown
speaker
but
not...
let's
take
them
one
at
a
time.
right
after
the
phrase
"acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
"
comes
"or
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government.
"
now,
wouldn't
that
really
include
the
first
example
you
have
just
given?
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
are
we
talking
about
them?
the
statute
is
in
the
disjunctive,
and
you
are
right,
in
the
latter
part
it
says,
"or
on
behalf
of
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government
thereof.
"
but
before
that
it
says,
"or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
"
which
suggests
to
me
that
that
phrase
must
mean
something
over
and
above
"any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government.
"
do
you
see
what
i
mean?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
grain
inspectors
are
an
example.
they
are
covered
by
a
separate
statute,
but
that
is
an
example,
is
it
not,
of
someone
acting
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
government?
are
there
other
examples
like
the
grain
inspectors
where
some
state
or
local
agency
or
employee
is
designated
by
law
to
be
an
agent
of
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morano,
did
the
uni
do
any
of
the
work
itself
in
any
occasion,
or
was
it
always
a
mere
conduit
for
the
federal
funds?
unknown
speaker
did
it
ever
do
any
of
the
rehabilitation
work
itself?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morano,
may
i
just
make
sure
i
understand?
you
said
that
uni
did
all
the
rehabilitation
work
itself.
by
that
i
take
it
you
mean
they
let
the
contracts
to
private
contractors
who
did
the
work.
they
didn't
do--
unknown
speaker
--they
didn't
actually
do
any
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
they
did
actually
some
physical
rehabilitation
work--
unknown
speaker
--with
their
own
personnel
as
well
as
contracting
work
out?
i
see.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
congress
could
have
authorized
the
federal
agency
itself
in
washington
to
go
out
and
do
all
this
community
rehabilitation,
awarding
the
contracts
directly
through
federal
employees?
could
they
have
done
it
that
way
if
congress
wanted
them
to?
any
constitutional
objection
to
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
instance,
congress
created
an
agency
which
was
authorized
by
congress
to
make
grants
in
the
communities
and
allow
the
grantee
of
that
community
to
carry
out
the
rehabilitation
of
housing.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
wasn't
everything
that
was
being
done
being
done
on
behalf
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
the
initiative
began
with
the
local
community
asking
the
federal
government
for
some
money,
and
then
the
federal
government
gave
the
money,
so
that
it
was
entirely
paid
for
by
the
federal
government,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
on
the
second...
on
the
disjunctive
aspect
of
what
justice
rehnquist
read
to
you,
isn't
all
this
conduct
by
these
people
being
done
on
behalf
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
forget
about
the
legislative
history
and
see
whether
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear.
if
it
is
clear,
we
don't
need
to
look
at
the
history,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
morano,
suppose
the
uni
just
took
the
money
and
bought
a
yacht
with
it?
would
there
be
any
federal
problem?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be?
well,
how
would
that
be?
how
would
that
come
about?
unknown
speaker
can
anybody
be
put
in
jail
for
taking
federal
money?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
hypothetical
is,
they
took
the
federal
money
and
bought
a
yacht
with
it,
and
i
am
asking
you,
is
that
legal
or
illegal
under
the
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn't
think
the
bribery
statute
covered
buying
a
yacht.
that
is
embezzlement,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
know
that
it's
a
crime?
i
mean,
you
say
uni
is
free
to
do
whatever
it
wants
to
do.
then
it
can
buy
a
yacht.
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
weren't
they
subject
to
an
audit
by
the
federal
government?
didn't
you
say
five
minutes
ago
that
hud
did
audit
it?
unknown
speaker
they
had
the
right
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
they
get
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
anybody
have
the
right
who
doesn't
have
the
money?
isn't
the
right
tied
to
the
money?
and
isn't
the
money
tied
to
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
do
you
agree
with
me?
unknown
speaker
i
have
forgotten
it.
0
[generallaughter.]
i
mean,
you
forgot
it,
so
i
forgot
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
morano,
you
are
now
referring
to
the
section
of
the
statute
that
speaks
of
under
or
by
authority
of
any
such
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government,
and
then
you
go
back...
if
you
go
back
earlier
in
the
statute,
within
the
same
subparagraph,
the
language
there,
"any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government.
"
is
separate
from
the
language,
"a
person
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
"
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
1
of
your
blue
brief.
i
think
one
could
make
the
argument
that
the
language
you
are
now
relying
on,
"under
or
by
authority,
modifies
only
the
phrase.
"
any
department,
agency,
or
branch
of
government,
"and
not"
a
person
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
"do
you
disagree
with
that"?
unknown
speaker
have
you
looked
at
18
united
states
code
recently
to
see
all
the
federal
criminal
statutes
there
are?
i
think
you
would
have
some
hesitancy
in
making
that
statement.
you
may
answer
if
you
wish.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
may
respond
to
my
comment.
you
may
respond
to
the
question
if
you
wish.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
making
the
point
that
there
are
a
great
number
of
federal
criminal
statutes
certainly.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
can
you
give
other
examples
of
federal
grant
programs
that
you
believe
should
be
treated
like
the
community
development
program
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
it
is
somewhat
of
a
concern
to
think
that
any
potential
recipient
of
federal
money
might
be
subject
to
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
certainly
in
the
fortune
versus
harris
case,
where
we
have
to
deal
with
the
freedom
of
information
act
question,
the
court
took
a
different
approach
and
said
that
grants
of
federal
funds
generally
don't
create
a
partnership
or
joint
venture
with
the
recipient,
and
they
don't
convert
the
acts
of
the
recipient
from
private
acts
to
governmental
acts,
and
so
forth,
and
took
a
different
approach.
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
unknown
speaker
would
congress
have
needed
to
even
pass
a
statute
expressly
covering,
for
example,
the
grain
inspectors
under
your
interpretation
of
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
is
your
argument,
in
a
nutshell,
as
to
why
these
people
are
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
that
they
were...
they
had
control
over
who
got
so-called
"federal
funds"?
unknown
speaker
well,
okay.
now,
you
say
the
benefits
of
a
federal
housing
rehabilitation
program.
i
take
it
then
it
is
a
good
deal
less
than
direct
control
over
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
many
concentric
circles
had
the
funds
gone
through
before
they
got
to
them?
unknown
speaker
like
the
city
of
peoria
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
a
block
grant
in
this
case,
not
any
sort
of
a
categorical
grant,
but
just
that
the
united
states
decided
to
give
$500,000
to
every
city
over
$100,000,
and
let's
assume
peoria
qualified
as
such
a
city,
and
then
peoria
in
turn
contracted
with
uni
to
develop
the
same
things
uni
was
doing,
and
some
of
the
money
that
peoria
used
came
from
the
federal
government
in
this
uncategorical
block
grant.
is
the
person
working
for
uni
still
subject
to
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
you
then
saying
that
the
less
authority
that
the
person
has
to
act
independently,
the
more
readily
you
would
conclude
that
he
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
so
if
there
were
a
blanket
authority
to
make
all
the
decisions,
he
would
not
be
acting
on
behalf
of
the
authority,
but
if
there
is
a
limited
authority
to
make
decisions,
he
is.
it
seems--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
you
said,
you
may
do
a,
b,
c,
or
d,
then
even...
it
is
not
on
behalf
of--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
just
put
it
a
little
differently.
were
the
people
employed
by
the
city
of
peoria
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
who
let
the
contract
to
uni?
unknown
speaker
in
letting
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
so
it
applies
to
them.
and
the
people
who
acted
on
behalf
of
uni
in
letting
the
contract
to
a
building
contractor,
these
people,
you
say,
were--
unknown
speaker
--now,
what
about
the
building
contractor
letting
a
subcontract
to
an
electrician?
unknown
speaker
but
your
submission
to
us
today
is
that
not
only
the
employees
of
uni
but
the
employees
of
the
general
contractors
with
whom
uni
contracted
are
also
within
the
federal
bribery
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
in
the
history
of
this
much
amended
statute
did
the
language
on
which
you
rely
become
a
part
of
the
statute?
this
was
in
the
19th
century,
i
believe,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
you
right
there?
unknown
speaker
you,
i
thought,
acknowledged
that
if
there
had
been
an
unrestricted
block
grant
from
which
all
of
the
salaries
were
paid
with
federal
money,
that
would
not
be
enough.
unknown
speaker
nevertheless,
you
continue
to
rely
heavily
on
the
fact
that
federal
money--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
the
key
fact
under
your
submission
is
the
extent
of
the
government
regulation
of
the
distribution
of
the
money.
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
ask
you
on
that,
was
there
a
violation
of
any
federal
regulation
pertaining
to
the
distribution
of
this
money?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
sure
you
have
answered
me.
was
there
a
violation
of
any
federal
regulation
controlling
the
distribution
of
this
money?
unknown
speaker
prohibit
subgrantees
from
taking
bribes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
defendant
had
his...
these
defendants
had
their
salary
paid
by
the
federal
government.
am
i
to
take
that
to
mean
that
their
salary
came
the
same
way
your
salary
and
mine
does--
unknown
speaker
--out
of
a
united
states
treasury
check?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
chain
of
distribution?
unknown
speaker
so
the
government
check
went
to
peoria,
there
was
a
check
drawn
by
the
city
of
peoria
to
uni--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
uni
wrote
these
salary
checks,
and
you
say
that
is
federal
funds.
unknown
speaker
but
how
far
back...
or
how
far
out
in
the
stream
of
things
can
you
go
with
that
argument?
i
mean,
these
people
probably
paid
their
checks
for
groceries
and
so
forth.
now,
are
you
going
to
say
that
the
grocer
got
federal
funds?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
may
i
turn
to
another
area
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind?
there
are
a
lot
of
federal
grant
programs
where
money
goes
to
state
agencies
and
cities,
and
the
states
and
the
cities
administer
the
funds
themselves
pursuant
to
federal
regulations
and
the
like.
are
the
various
state
and
local
officials
who
administer
those
programs
subject
to
federal
bribery
statutes?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
thinking
of
situations,
and
we
recently
had
this
panhurst
case
reargued
in
which
there
was
a
state
program
for
care
of
the
mentally
ill,
which
is
partially
financed
by
federal
funds,
and
the
grant
is
subject
to
all
sorts
of
regulation,
and
the
state
officials
were
doing
their
normal
state
duties
but
are
also
carrying
out
a
federal
function.
i
gather
under
your
theory
it
would
still
be
subject
to
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
it
may
well
be
correct,
but
i
am
just
trying
to
think
of--
unknown
speaker
--well,
it's
their
official
state
function--
unknown
speaker
--just
as
these
people
are
doing
their
uni
duties--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
say
it
is
a
kind
of
a
mixed
function,
both
federal
and
otherwise
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins?
unknown
speaker
let's
back
up
a
minute.
we
talked
about
a
subcontractor--
unknown
speaker
--like
an
electrician.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
abc
electric
wire
company
bribes
the
electrician
subcontractor.
is
that
covered?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
where
does
the
line
cut
off?
unknown
speaker
it
cuts
off
some
place
before
the
grocery.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
man
is
furnishing
electric
wire
to
the
subcontractor
who
is
working
for
the
contractor
who
you
say
is
directly
under
the
federal
government.
well,
is
he
covered
or
not?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
how
about
in
medicaid
and
medicare
programs?
how
far
do
you
take
it
there?
unknown
speaker
so
the
doctors
and
pharmacists
and
so
forth
are
all
covered?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
at
all
times
some
kind
of
a
right
to
audit
the
operation?
unknown
speaker
but
they
just
didn't
happen
to
do
it
in
time.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
one
final
question.
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask,
but
you
do
have
time
here.
judge
powell
often
sends
me
to
the
dictionary,
and
i
notice
you
quoted
his
hypogulia.
unknown
speaker
what
is--
unknown
speaker
--you
quote
it
in
your
brief,
so
you
must
know
what
the
word
means.
unknown
speaker
inability
to
act
or--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
and
therefore
they
had
authority
to
make
decisions.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
