mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
united
states
has
just
a
few
brief
points
to
make.
the
statutory
construction
question
presented
by
this
case
is
indeed
readily
resolved.
the
plain
language
of
18
usc
section
201
as
well
as
its
legislative
history
and
the
broad
public
policies
underlying
the
federal
bribery
statute
clearly
demonstrate
the
petitioners
are
public
officials
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
bribery
statute.
at
the
outset
a
few
facts,
i
believe,
are
necessary
to
put
this
question
in
its
proper
perspective.
petitioners
were
the
executive
director
and
housing
rehabilitation
coordinator
of
united
neighborhoods,
incorporated,
a
public
or
a
non-profit
public
corporation
that
was
designed
to
perform
various
functions.
one
of
these
was
the
distribution
of
federal
housing
funds
obtained
from
the
federal
government
through
the
city
of
peoria
under
the
housing
and
community
development
act
of
1974.
as
detailed
in
our
brief,
united
neighborhoods'
use
of
these
funds
and
petitioners'
administration
of
these
funds
was
subject
to
a
whole
host
of
federal
substantive
and
procedural
regulations.
the
federal
government
designed
the
program,
set
forth
what
activities
uni
could
undertake,
set
forth
how
the
funds
were
to
be
managed
and
administered.
indeed,
although
the
petitioners
say
the
federal
government
relinquished
control
over
these
funds,
the
legislative
reports
on
the
'72...
on
the
'74
legislation
state
unequivocally
that
congress
provided
extensive
executive
oversight
"to
ensure
that
federal
funds
are
being
used
efficiently
to
achieve
national
objectives.
"
therefore,
this
was
not
a
mere
local
project,
but
rather,
as
uni
itself
stated
in
its
application
for
federal
housing
funds,
it
proposed
to
undertake
"a
joint
effort
with
the
city
of
peoria
to
achieve
the
common
goals
as
set
forth
in
the
housing
and
community
development
act.
"
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
certainly,
it
is
a
subject
of
some
concern,
but
i
think
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
handle
that
concern,
justice
o'connor.
the
statute
applies
only
to
a
person
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
in
an
official
function,
so
it
isn't
just
anyone
who
receives
some
sort
of
federal
fund
or
some
sort
of
federal
subsidy.
it
is
someone
who
performs
an
official
function
on
behalf
of
the
government.
for
example,
the
seventh
circuit
case
noted
by
petitioners
in
mosley,
there
the
defendant
was
charged
with
administering
the
comprehensive
education
and
training
act,
ceta
funds,
and
he
had
the
control.
he
could
determine
who
would
receive
the
benefit
of
those
federal
funds.
in
this
case,
the
power
to
determine
who
receives
a
federal
housing
rehabilitation
contract
is
surely
an
important
official
function.
this
isn't
a
case
where
just
anyone
who
receives
funds
falls
within
the
reach
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
certainly,
that...
perhaps,
though...
you
have
to
look
at
the
underlying
goals
of
the
different
statutes
involved
also.
i
think
when
you
understand
or
when
you
consider
that
the
underlying
goal
of
federal
bribery
law
is
to
protect
the
public
from
the
evils
of
corruption
in
public
service,
the
statute
must
be
broad
enough,
must
be
construed
broadly
enough
to
deal
with
that
concern,
and
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
as
i
hope
to
detail
in
a
few
moments--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--sure.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
indeed
they
don't.
in
fact,
the
case
involving
the
grain
inspectors
cited
in
our
brief,
the
kirby
case,
does
not
involve
the
statute
that
specifically
makes
grain
inspectors
public
officials.
there
are
two
statutes
that
govern
grain
inspectors,
the
warehousemen's
act
and
the
grain
inspectors'
act.
the
inspectors
involved
in
kirby
were
licensed
under
the
warehousemen
act.
that
statute
doesn't
make
them
public
officials.
there
is
no
express
statute.
the
court
there
therefore
just
had
to
analogize,
or
had
to
look
at
the
case
in
terms
of
the
statute
and
say,
were
these
people
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
they
concluded,
yes,
they
were.
so
that
case
is
an
example
clearly
where
someone
was
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
without
any
specific
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
they
had
substantial
control
over
who
would
receive
the
benefits
of
a
federal
housing
rehabilitation
program.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
justice
rehnquist,
they
did
indeed
have
direct
control
over
federal
funds.
they
were
the
persons
who
were
administering
funds
that
were
provided
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
the
funds
went
directly
to
the...
the
program
is
set
up...
the
housing
and
community
development
act
is
set
up
in
this
fashion.
funds
are
given
directly
to
local
governmental
entities.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
like
the
city
of
peoria.
regulations...
the
statute
then
allows
the
city
to
turn
to
a
subgrantee
and
allow
a
subgrantee
to
administer
those
funds.
regulations
promulgated
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
closely
circumscribed
who
can
be
a
subgrantee.
it
wasn't
as
if
the
city
of
peoria
could
choose
any
old
group
it
wanted
to
to
administer
these
federal
housing
funds.
uni
had
to
meet
specific
and
strict
eligibility
regulations
and
guidelines
to
be
able
to
administer
these
funds.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
that
circumstance,
it
might
be
more
questionable.
indeed,
that
was
the
original
proposal
here.
in
1974,
the
nixon
administration
proposed
just
giving
block
grants
with
no
strings
attached,
no
substantial
federal
oversight.
congress
balked
and
in
fact
flatly
rejected
that.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
they
said,
we
want
to
impose
these
sorts
of
controls,
regulations,
we
want
to
closely
circumscribe
the
activities
that
the
local
governments
can
undertake.
we
are
going
to
closely
circumscribe
what
activities
subgrantees
can
undertake.
we
are
going
to
provide
for
audits.
we
are
going
to
provide
for
review.
we
are
going
to
keep
our
fingers
in
there
to
ensure
that
these
funds
are
being
used
for
national
objectives.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
is
right,
because
if
the
federal
government
has
limited
your
authority
and
said
you
can
do
a,
b,
and
c,
but
not
d,
when
you
do
a,
b,
and
c,
then
you
are
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
don't
know
whether
i
follow
that
analogy.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
their
function
as--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--determining
who
was
going
to
receive
the
funds,
they
probably
were
acting
on
behalf,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
now,
that,
in
certain
circumstances,
that
circumstance
could
be
followed.
there
is
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
the
raff
case...
it
is
rather
old,
i
think,
20
years
old...
where
you
had
an
architect
that
was
hired
to
build
an
air
force
base,
and
as
part
of
his...
he
was
bribed
to
hand
out
or
to
not
inspect
certain
work
by
subcontractors,
et
cetera,
and
he
was
held
liable
under
the
bribery
statute.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
an
important
thing
to
remember--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the...
yes,
it
was.
i
will
digress
for
a
minute
and
handle
the
legislative
history
at
this
point,
because
it
does
seem
of
some
concern.
this
statute
was
amended
for
perhaps...
well,
several
times,
but
one
time
in
1948
congress
expressly
amended
the
statute
and
kind
of
broadened
the
language
even
further
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
strang,
which
had
held
on
the
basis
of
familiar
agency
principles
that
an
employee
of
a
government
controlled
corporation
did
not
come
within
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
because
he
wasn't
an
agent
of
the
united
states.
congress
at
that
point,
when
it
adopted
this
language
in
1948,
in
the
legislative
report
said,
we
mean
to
overcome
the
holding
in
strang.
the
growth
of
the
federal
government
has
been
phenomenal.
we
are
delegating
all
kinds
of
responsibilities
and
governmental
powers
to
private
entities,
et
cetera,
that
wasn't
foreseen
in
the
past.
we
mean
to
cover
all
persons
who
perform
official
functions
on
behalf
of
the
government.
in
1962,
congress
looked
at
this
again,
and
indeed
there
were
proposals
made
to
restrict
the
statute
as
petitioners
would
restrict
it.
there
were
bills
introduced
that
would
have
defined
public
official
as
officer,
agent,
or
employee.
they
were
debated,
and
they
were
rejected.
the
committee
reports
state
that
the
reason
this
narrow
language
was
rejected
was
because
they
intended
to
include
within
statutory
coverage
all
person
who
perform
activities
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
this
legislative
history
does
not
in
any
way
evidence
any
sort
of
an
intent
to
narrow
the
reach
of
this
statute.
an
important
fact
to
remember
in
this
case,
although
we
can
hypothesize
circumstances
where
people
might...
where
there
might
be
less
federal
control
or
less
federal
involvement,
in
this
case,
petitioners
were
paid
100
percent
of
their
salaries
by
the
federal
government.
they
could
not
perform
any
activity--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
that's--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
it
is
one
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
it
was
all
federal
money,
and
it
was
heavily
restricted.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly,
but
the
fact--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--there
are
federal
regulations.
there
are
regulations
of
hud
that
would
proscribe
the
kinds
of
activities
that
were
undertaken
here.
the
remedy
provided
by
the
regulations
is
withdrawal
of
funds
or
recoupment
of
the
funds.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
because
there
are...
as
i
said,
there
are
regulations
that
prohibit
the--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--from
taking
bribes
and
kickbacks,
but
the
remedy
for
that
as
provided
by
the
regulations
is
recoupment
of
the
funds
or
taking
away
of
grant
funds
in
the
future.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
it
didn't.
it
came
through
the
grant...
the
moneys
came
through
the
funding
process
set
up
and
established
by
the
housing
community
development
program.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
as
i
explained
earlier,
it
went
directly
to
the
city
of
peoria,
and
then
according
to
federal
regulations
to
the
subgrantee.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
but
the
funds
were
always
subject
to
federal
control
and
audit.
indeed,
there
was
an
audit
of
these
funds
that
was
performed
not
according
to
standards
set
up
by
the
city
of
peoria.
the
audit
was
performed
according
to
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development's
audit
standards.
the
argument
of
how
the
funds
arrived
has
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
fact
in
the
past,
the
old
united
states
ex
rel.
marcus
v.
hess
case.
it
was
a
false
claims
case,
but
the
argument
was
made
that
since
the
funds
or
the
false
claim
was
really
made
against
a
city
or
a
municipal
government,
that
it
wasn't
a
claim
against
the
united
states,
and
this
court
said
the
fact
that
moneys
were
channeled
through
a
municipal--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--no.
at
the
point
federal
control...
federal
control
over
these
funds
dissipates
at
the
point
that
the
money
is
properly
paid,
perhaps,
to
a
contractor.
i
mean,
at
the
point
where
federal
regulation
of
the
program
ceases,
of
course,
federal
control
over
the
funds
would
cease.
in
a
vain
attempt
to
avoid
the
plain
language
of
this
statute,
petitioners,
although
it
is
undisputed
that
in
the
course
of
their
administration
of
these
funds
they
solicited
and
accepted
$42,000
in
return
for
their
awarding
particular
contractors
federal
housing
contracts,
they
argue
that
they
were
not
acting
in
an
official
function
or
acting
under
or
by
authority
of
a
branch
of
the
government.
this
argument,
as
i
have
already
detailed
to
some
extent,
is
unavailing,
because
in
performing
the
function
of
awarding
federally
funded
housing
rehabilitation
contracts
for
purposes
contemplated
by
federal
law,
they
were
clearly
performing
an
important
official
function.
they
could
only
do
so
according
to
the
regulations
promulgated
by
hud,
and
they
were
therefore
acting
under
or
by
direction
of
that
agency.
the
legislative
history,
moreover,
supports
this
construction.
as
i
went
through
a
few
moments
ago,
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
demonstrates
unequivocally
that
congress
intended
to
reach
out
broadly
to
include
all
persons
who
perform
official
functions
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
and
finally,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
federal
policies
underlying
federal
bribery
law
clearly
demonstrate
the
petitioners
should
fall
within
the
definition
of
public
official.
the
purpose
of
a
federal
bribery
law
is,
of
course,
to
protect
the
public
against
the
corruption...
or
the
evils
of
corruption
in
public
service.
the
power
that
was
used
corruptly
by
petitioners
in
this
case
is
an
important
governmental
power.
it
is
critical
to
the
success
of
the
housing
and
community
development
act
programs
that
the
authority
to
determine
who
receives
federal
contracts
not
be
corrupted
by
bribery.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
they
may
well
indeed
be
subject
to
federal
bribery
statutes.
there
was
a
case
in
district
court
out...
it
is
a
district
court
case
out
of
new
mexico
as
cited
in
our
brief,
the
gallegos
case,
where
the
state
of
new
mexico
hired
a
state
employee
to
administer
an
assistance
program
set
up
by
the
fha
administration
to
assist
farmers.
he
was
a
state
employee,
but
his
only
function
was
to
assist
the
implementation
of
this
federal
program,
and
he
was
held
to
be
within
the
reach.
now,
again,
i
don't
believe
this
raises
any
substantial
concerns
regarding
an
undue
broad
sweep
for
this
statute
because
in
any--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right,
if
they
were
performing
an
official
function,
as
i
said.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
fiscal
year
1983,
the
federal
government
has
appropriated
over
$4
billion
into
the
housing
program
that
was
administered
by
petitioners.
it
is
essential
to
the
proper
administration
of
this
undeniably
federal
program
that
the
federal
government
be
able
to
take
the
steps
necessary,
including
criminal
prosecutions
for
bribery--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--to
ensure...
yes?
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
would--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
line
cuts
off,
justice
marshall--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes.
it
cuts
off
at
any
point
that
someone
ceases
to
do
an
official
function
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in...
if
there--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it
would
depend
on
some
attendant
facts.
for
example,
the
raff
case
cited
in
our
brief,
that
involved
the
architect
for
building
a
large
military
base.
he
was
bribed
by
subcontractors
not
to
look
carefully
at
his
work
or
inspect
carefully
his
work.
that
contractor
was
bribed.
now,
as
you
move
further
down
the
steps,
i
guess
it
would
depend
whether
or
not,
at
any
given
step,
whether
the
subcontractor
could
be
said
to
exercise
some
sort
of
official
authority
that
would
fall
back
on
the
federal
fisc.
if
the
federal
subcontractor,
for
example,
could
chose
wire
from
one
distributor
or
another,
and
the
cost
of
that
wire
would
go
directly
to
the
federal
government,
and
he
had
the
authority
to
make
that
determination,
and
he
was
being
bribed
to
choose
inferior
wire,
he
may
indeed
fall
within
the
reach
of
the
contract.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
the
medicaid
and
medicare,
i
am
not
terribly
familiar
with
the
legislative
scheme
or
statutory
scheme
for
those
programs.
i
would
believe
i
would
be
handled
similarly
to
the
ceta
case,
the
mosely
case.
if
the
person
has
direct
control
for
the
authorization
or
the
expenditure
or
the
distribution
of
federal
funds,
and
he
had
the
ability
to
make
that
sort
of
controlling
decision,
and
the
impact
of
that
decision
fell
back
on
the
federal
government,
on
the
federal
taxpayers,
i
think
you
would
say
in
that
circumstance
that
he
was
exercising
an
official
function.
again--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--i
am
not
sure
whether
you
would
go
clear
down
to
the
pharmacists
and
all
sorts
of
lower
level
echelons.
in
this
circumstance,
we
are
aware,
or
at
least
if
you
read
the
newspapers,
you
are
aware
that
there
is
substantial
graft
and
corruption
in
the
administration
of
those
programs.
the
federal
statute
we,
the
government,
submits
should
be
interpreted
broadly
enough
to
reach
anyone
who
has...
exercises
any
sort
of
official
function
in
the
administration
of
that
program
and
does
so
corruptly.
the
language
of
section
201(a),
its
legislative
history,
and
the
important
policies
underlying
federal
bribery
law
unequivocally
demonstrate
that
the
statute
should
not
be
given
the
restrictive
reading
that
has
been
urged
upon
this
court
by
petitioners.
the
united
states
respectfully
submits
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
think
that
the
remedy
is
against
the
entity.
i
am
not
100
percent
clear
on
that,
but
i
think
the
remedy
is
against--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--yes--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--they
did.
they
did
do
this.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
mean,
that...
it
is
a
misstatement
in
the
briefs.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
there
was
an
audit
performed
here
on
these
funds,
and
the
audit
was
performed
according
to
audit
standards
developed
by
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
hypogulia.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
went
to
the
unabridged
dictionary
yesterday,
in
case
someone
would
ask
me
that.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
means
inability
to
act
or
decide.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
they
displayed
no
evidence
of
inability
to
act
or
decide.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
and
therefore
they
had
authority.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
thank
you.
