the
other
two
cases
are
dixson
against
the

and

against
united
states,
5279
and
5331.
these
consolidated
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
issue
is
one
of
federal
criminal
jurisdiction.
specifically,
whether
the
petitioners
are
“public
officials”
as
that
term
is
defined
in
the
federal
bribery
statute
under
which
petitioners
were
indicted
and
convicted.
the
petitioners
were
officers
of
a
nonprofit
corporation
administrating
and
expending
federal
housing
and
community
development
act
block
grants
as
the
subgrantee
of
the
city
of
peoria.
the
government's
evidence
at
trial
was
that
petitioners
both
have
used
their
positions
to
extract
about
$42,000
from
contractors
seeking
to
work
on
urban
rehabilitation
projects.
for
purpose
of
the
federal
bribery
statute,
a
public
official
includes
a
person
acting
for
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
or
any
department
of
the
government.
congress
first
adopted
and
broadly
drafted
bribery
statute
in
1853
and
affirmed
and
adopted
the
language
at

in
this
case
in
1962

they
conclude
that
congress
wishes
the
courts
to
inquire,
not
simply
whether
a
person
has
signed
a
contract
or
agreement
to
serve
on
government
as
a
government
agent,
but
rather
whether
a
person
who
holds
a
position
of
public
trust
with
official
federal
responsibilities.
clearly,
the
petitioners
did
so.
as
executive
of
the
subgrantee
corporation,
they
had
operational
responsibility
for
the
administration
of
a
federal
grant
program.
in
allocating
the
federal
funds,
they
were
charged
with
--
abiding
by
federal
guidelines
which
directed
both
where
and
how
the
federal
funds
were
to
be
distributed.
by
accepting
the
responsibility
for
distributing
these
federal
fiscal
resources,
petitioners
assumed
the
official
role
of
administering
a
social
service
program
established
by
the
united
states
congress.
in
our
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
therefore
hold
that
petitioners
acted
as
public
officials
under
this
act
when
they
solicited
and
accepted
bribes
in
awarding
the
federally
funded
contracts
for
housing
rehabilitation.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan,
