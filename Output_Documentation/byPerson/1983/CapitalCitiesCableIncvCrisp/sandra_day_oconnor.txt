well,
if
network
television
producers
can
give
advance
notice,
why
can't
the
producers
of
the
cable
broadcast
do
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
technical
reason,
i
guess
i
am
asking,
why
the
producers
of
the
cable
broadcast
couldn't
do
the
same
for
their...
for
the
stations
that
use
their
broadcasts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
technical
reason
why
the
cablecasters
couldn't
furnish
that
information
to
you,
to
your
client?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
no
encoding
mechanism
that
could
be
employed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
cable
operator
have
to
participate
in
the
compulsory
licensing
system
provided
by
the
copyright
act?
or
can
you
opt
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
midcal
decision
indicate
that
where
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
a
factor,
that
some
kind
of
balancing
has
to
be
employed
in
determining
whether
there
is
preemption?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
a
little
hard
to
understand
how
the
court
would
be
able
to
resolve
the
non-commercial
speech
first
amendment
argument
or
issue
as
well
as
the
preemption
issue
without
some
kind
of
a
factual
record.
i
just
wonder
how
that
could
be
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
what
are
the
reasons
for
the
non-deletion
requirements
of
the
fcc
rules?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
in
making
the
preemption
analysis,
do
you
think
that
the
court
has
to
do
the
midcal
type
of
balancing
because
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcdonald,
did
you
think
there
was
enough
evidence
for
a
balancing
type
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
agreed
not
to
introduce
any
more.
is
that
right?
