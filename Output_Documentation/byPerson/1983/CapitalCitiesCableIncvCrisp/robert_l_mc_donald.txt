mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
state
of
oklahoma
may
prohibit
the
advertising
of
liquor
in
oklahoma
by
the
television
medium
coming
into
the
homes
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
petitioners
contend
that
there
are
two
impediments
to
that,
and
they
rely
upon
the
first
amendment,
a
first
amendment
ground
and
a
preemption
ground.
first,
let's
talk
about
the
regulatory
scheme
and
the
historical
basis
for
the
rule
itself
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
oklahoma's
prohibition
of
liquor
advertisement
is
part
of
a
state
constitutional
amendment
which
repealed
prohibition
in
1959.
one
of
the
conditions
of
that
repealing
was
that
they
retain
the
prohibition
against
liquor
advertisement.
of
course,
now,
the
state's
interest
is
the
purpose
of
the
prohibition
against
liquor
advertising,
and
that
is
to
prevent
the
artificial
stimulation
of
the
consumption
of
alcohol,
or
increasing
the
consumption
of
alcohol,
or
to
consume
alcohol
if
you
do
not
consume
it.
i
think
we
must
keep
in
mind
here
that
this
is
the
electronic
medium.
in
the
fcc
case
and
some
of
the
other
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
electronic
medium
is
treated
specially
because
of
the
uninvited...
as
an
uninvited
guest,
especially
in
commercial
speech,
into
the
home,
and
the
impression
that
it
has
upon
people
who
can't
read,
or
we
are
talking
about
children.
what
is
the
relationship
of
this
state
regulation
to
commerce?
first
of
all,
i
think
that
it
must
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that...
i
don't
think
there's
any
argument
about
it...
that
the
rule
was
pursued...
was
pursuant
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
don't
know
if
counsel
makes
light
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
but
we
don't
make
light
of
it
in
oklahoma.
oklahoma
historically
has
had
a
regulatory
scheme,
a
very
strict
regulation
of
alcohol
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
value
our
right
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
it
is
one
of
the...
it
is
the
only
express
grant
of
power
to
the
states,
and
we
pursue
and
claim
our
right
in
this
particular
case
that
we
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
artificial
stimulation
of
alcohol,
and
we
think
that
in
preventing
the
artificial
stimulation
of
alcohol,
that
is,
liquor
advertising,
that
we
are
pursuing
the
right
to
the
twenty-first
amendment.
that
is
an
incident
of
regulating
alcoholic
beverages
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
are
not
trying
to
regulate
speech.
we
feel
like
that
the
incidence
of
the
evils
of
alcohol
has
been
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
in
newspapers?
there
is...
it
is
against
the
law
to
advertise
in
newspapers.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
we
could...
it
was
interpreted
in
a
national
publication...
we
do
for
the
local
publications.
that's
true.
now,
for
national
publications
is
the
only
time
that
the
courts
and
the
attorney
general's
office
interpreting
the
courts'
rulings
on
it
is
that
it
is
impractical
or
it
is
impossible
to
regulate
out
of
state
newspapers.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
that's
right.
intercept
them
either
at
the
mailbox
or
at
the--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--yes.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
it
is
like
that
argument,
but
we
would
distinguish
the
facts
and
the
degree
of
impracticability.
in
trying
to
enforce
that
law...
and
we
do,
of
course,
in
the
publications
intrastate.
it
is
just
the
national
publications.
and
we
would
have
to
intercept
them
at
the
border
or
at
the
mailboxes
when
they
were
mailed,
and
there
are
several
million
people
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
so
we
think
that
certainly
that...
and
of
course,
now,
we
have
been
looking
at
the
national
publications,
because
we
are
noticing
in
the
national
publications
that
it
may
be
now
technologically
feasible
to
do
that,
because
they
have
regional
advertising.
we
are
noticing
in
national
publications
that
there's
advertisements
directed...
in
the
national
publications
directly
for
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
well,
of
course,
now,
it
wouldn't
be
national...
what
i'm
talking
about,
national
publications,
those--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--it
would
apply
to
signboards
also,
and
it
did
until
the
stay,
of
course,
was...
until
the
stay
ordered
by
the
court
was
imposed
staying
the
order
of
the
tenth
circuit,
before
the
case
at
the
district
court
level,
there
was
a
prohibition
against
signboards
or
billboards
advertising
liquor
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
municipalities,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
no,
that
is
pursuant
to
the
permission
of
the
federal
communications.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
think
that
is
very--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--i
think
that's
a
possibility
in
oklahoma.
i
don't
think
the
fcc
would
think
too
much
about
it,
though.
they
might
have
a
different
viewpoint.
it
is
this
regulatory
scheme
which
petitioners
argue
are
preempted
by
federal
communications
and
copyright
regulations.
we
think
these
laws,
however,
do
not
preempt
the
state
legislation
challenge.
now,
what
they
are
talking
about
is
the
traditional
supremacy
clause.
now,
we
are
calling
for
a
balancing
test.
we
don't
think
the
traditional
supremacy
clause
comes
into
play
here.
the
petitioners
maintain,
especially
the
fcc,
maintain
that
the
communications
act
and
copyright
acts
preempts
state
law.
they
are
invoking
the
traditional
supremacy
clause.
what
we
maintain,
of
course,
is
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
authorizes
the
state
of
oklahoma,
which
we
enacted
our
regulation
pursuant
thereto,
is
on
the
same
level
as
the
federal
communications
act.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
think...
well,
we
are
calling
for
a
balancing
test.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
am
saying
under
the
competing
interests
that
we
have
more
compelling
interests,
because
we
are
trying
to
protect
the
effect
of
alcohol
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
what
i
am
saying
is
there
is
a
balancing
test.
under
the
traditional
supremacy
clause
i
concede
we
would
probably
fail
because
there
is
an
express
conflict
and
preemption
would
probably
prevail.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
as
applied.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
to
this
fact
situation.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
are
exercising
our
constitutional
rights,
too,
in
oklahoma.
the
twenty-first
amendment
and
the
other
clauses
that
the
federal
act,
the
copyright
act
are
pursuant
to
are
clauses
of
the
same
constitution,
so
we
are
just
claiming
our
right
to
be
on
the
same
level,
and
that
you
should
have
a
balancing
test,
and
not
to
go
by
the
traditional
supremacy
clause
test.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
well,
on
budweiser,
on
beer
advertising,
by
statute,
and
of
course,
are
reevaluating
that
because
some
of
the
findings
of
some
of
the
effects
of
beer,
especially...
by
statute,
by
definition,
a
non-intoxicating
beverage
is
anything
less
than
3.2.
budweiser
maintains
that
they
are
advertising
3.2
beer
or
less,
and
so
they
are
exempt
from
the
advertising,
so
normally
you
will
see
budweiser
on
the
sides
of
trucks,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
there
is
a
prohibition
against--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--yes,
they
can
sell--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--they
repealed
prohibition
in
1959.
they
may
sell
it
at
a
licensed
liquor
store.
but
the
prohibition
is
a
total
ban
on
liquor
advertising
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
so
it
would
be
applied
to
trucks
as
well
as
any
other
type
of
medium.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
attitude
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
now,
since
1959--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--we
don't
think
the
companies
would
spend
$1
billion
a
year
in
the
united
states
advertising
liquor
if
they
didn't
think
it
would
increase
the
consumption
of
liquor.
we
think
that
advertising...
it
is
just
common
sense...
causes
an
artificial
stimulation
to
consume
liquor,
and
especially
in
this
particular
case,
the
electronic
media--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--not
all
the
other
states
allow
advertising.
mississippi
doesn't.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
think
there's
30
something
regulate
advertising.
i
don't
know
how
many
have
a
total
ban.
i
know
of
two.
the
reasoning
in
the
second
particular
case,
and
that
is
in
commercial
speech,
that
the
district
court
really
has
as
its
holding
was
that
it
did
not
meet
the
central
hudson
test.
we
maintain
that
it
does
meet
that,
and
the
tenth
circuit
was
correct
in
applying
the
central
hudson
test
and
declaring
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
was
a
rational
basis
between
the
prohibition
of
liquor
advertising
and
the
state's
interest.
we
might
point
out
that
they
applied
the
four-part
test
of
the
central
hudson
test
and...
first
of
all
recognized
commercial
speech
as
being
a
lawful
activity
and
being
not
misleading,
and
that
there
was
a
substantial
state
interest,
that
is,
a
temperance
interest.
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
the
state's
regulation
directly
advanced
that
interest,
and
that
it
was
not
more
extensive
than
necessary.
in
fact,
they
said
that
one
of
the
other
alternatives,
of
course,
could
be
that
they
could
completely
prohibit
the
sale
of
liquor
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
if
they
wanted
to,
and
this
would
seem
like
it
would
be
more
of
a
lesser
means
of
trying
to
regulate
alcohol.
i
think
what
we
must
keep
in
mind,
we
are
trying
to
regulate
alcohol.
we
are
not
trying
to
regulate
speech.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
we
don't
think
so,
because
that
would
not
involve
commercial
speech.
that
is
a
matter
of
protected
speech
other
than
non-commercial,
so
we
don't
think
it
would
come
into
play,
and
oklahoma
would
not
try
to
prevent
anything
like
that.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
well,
it's
not--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--yes,
but
under
the
definitions
of
the
abc
act,
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
act
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
that
is
not
a
commercial,
your
honor,
so
it
wouldn't
be
anything
to
be
able
to
enforce
there.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
oh,
okay.
i
understand
your
question
now,
your
honor.
i
think
if
oklahoma
did
try
to
enforce
any
type
of
regulation
that
might
try
to
comprehend
that,
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
a
balancing
test
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
of
course
i
think
probably
if
you
went
into
the
balancing
test
you
would
have
commercial
speech
or
some
type
of...
well,
commercial
speech
and
have
a
balancing
test.
i
don't
think
we
would
win
in
a
case
like
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
what
you've
got
it,
you've
got
competing
interests
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
the
competing
interest,
i
think,
would
be
attenuated
in
trying
to
enforce
the
regulation
in
a
situation
like
that.
i
don't
think
we
could
prevail.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
no,
we
would
not
be
able
to
enforce
that
act
outside
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
no,
not
if
they...
we
have
no
way
of
regulating
that.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
well,
i
think
that
could
be
another
fact
situation
than
your
fact
situation.
that
is,
if
it
was
in
oklahoma
there,
and--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
we
think
the
analyses
that
you
would
use
in
the
balancing
test
would
be
similar
to
the
analysis
that
was
used
in
the
commercial
speech
or
a
first
amendment
type
balancing
test.
one
thing
that
we
think
that
might
be
some
problems,
and
had
some
problems
below,
we
believe...
we
realize
the
record
was
meager
below.
there
was
quite
some
confusion,
i
think,
in
trying
to
read
the
record,
just
what
type
of
burdens
or
what
type
of
criteria.
was
this
a
first
amendment
case?
was
it
a
preemption
case?
who
had
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
challenging?
the
court...
from
reading
the
record,
my
impression
of
reading
the
record
was
that
the
court
was
not...
was
going
along
with
a
regular
type
of
first
amendment
or
supremacy
type
as
far
as
getting
to
a
preemption
type
of
test.
it
was
confusing
to
me
what
type
of
test
or
criteria
was
being
used.
so
i
think--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--your
honor,
i
did
not
think
there
was
enough
evidence
on
either
side
to
really
decide--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--that's
correct,
because
it
was
going
along
the
first
amendment
grounds.
we
believe
that
the
tenth
circuit
applied
the
proper
test,
and
that
was
the
central
hudson
test.
of
course,
now,
they
tipped
their
hat
to
preemption
and
said
that
was
a
problem,
and
they
said
it
would
be
impractical.
now,
we
think
that...
of
course,
now,
the
fcc
in
their
brief,
in
their
argument
before
this
court,
they
don't
seem
to
recognize
the
twenty-first
amendment,
or
they...
when
they
do
recognize
it,
they
don't
give
it
the
import
that
we
do
in
oklahoma.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
because
it
wasn't
raised
very
vigorously
down
at
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
don't
think
so,
no.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
not--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--they
just...
because
of
the...
the
way
that
it
was
raised
was
because...
was
along
the
regular
standard
preemption.
that
was
that
it
was
impractical.
it
was
brought
up
at
the
district
court
level
and
at
the
tenth
circuit
level
about
the
impracticality
of
deleting
the--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--i
don't
think
it
was
squarely
presented
to
them,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
think
what
they
did
was,
they
recognized
that
the
record
was
meager
at
the
district
court
level,
that
the
court
was
talking
about
the
impracticality
of
it
and
the
burden
that
it
would
have
on
cablecasters.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
well,
they
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
am
talking
about--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
decide
whether
they
were
looking
at
really
a
preemption--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--one
of
the
other
things
that
we
think
that
should
be
addressed
by
this
court
is
that
what
type
of
setting
is
there
when
a
twenty-first
amendment
case
is
presented
to
the
court,
that
it
go
with
a
presumption
in
favor
of
the
state
in
a
competing
interest
between
the
federal
interest
and
the
state's
interest,
or
what
type
of
record.
does
there
have
to
be
any
evidence?
one
of
the
problems
that
was
presented,
of
course,
to
the
metromedia
case
was
that,
and
it
was
raised,
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
presented
at
the
district
court
level
which
showed
that
banning
of
billboards
would
improve
the
safety
or
the
aesthetic
aspect
of
san
diego.
this
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
court
could
make
that
and
no
evidence
would
need
to
be
presented
on
that,
that
you
would
apply
a
rational
basis.
and
we
think
that
in
this
particular
situation
there
is
a
rational
basis.
what
are
some
of
the
dangers
of
petitioners'
arguments?
you
are
going
to
have
possibly,
and
it
was
raised
by
one
of
the
questions
when
petitioners
were
presenting
their
argument,
and
that
is,
what
about
an
unlawful
activity
being
advertised
by
the
cablecaster?
that
would
not
have
commercial
speech
protection,
because
it
would
be
concerning
unlawful
activity,
and
it
would
not
meet
the
central
hudson
test.
well,
they
are
saying
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
no
authority
to
or
any
control
because
it
is
preempted.
it
would
be
up
to
the
federal...
or
the
fcc
to
enforce
the
type
of
violations
of
state
law
where
it
would
be
an
unlawful
activity
and
they
would
be
advertising
it
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
we
must
also
address
the
problem
of
the
electronic
media,
and
that
is
the
children
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
because
cable
television
is
getting
very
pervasive
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
it
is
getting
very
popular.
it
is
getting
into
the
homes,
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
there
were
many
complaints
that
came
in
that
resulted
in
the
request
of
an
ag's
opinion
to
determine
whether
cablecasting
or
cable
television
fell
under
the
prohibition
of
liquor
advertising,
and
the
opinion
was
rendered,
because
of
the
coming
into
homes,
and
it
had
not
been
coming
into
the
homes
before,
and
people
were
getting
rather
excited
about
the
uninvited
solicitation
to...
for
the
artificial
stimulation
to
consume
alcohol.
in
conclusion,
the
petitioners'
challenges
to
oklahoma's
restriction
on
liquor
advertising
is
not
supported
by
sound
constitutional
arguments,
nor
is
petitioners'
position
supported
by
sound
public
policy.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
petitioners'
position,
it
would
leave
states
powerless
to
protect
a
citizen
against
liquor
advertising,
no
matter
how
fraudulent,
no
matter
how
deceptive.
under
the
petitioners'
arguments,
the
federal
government,
despite
the
twenty-first
amendment,
has
absolute
power
to
dictate
that
the
children
of
oklahoma
be
subjected
to
television
advertising
of
alcohol
that
is
aimed
specifically
at
encouraging
the
consumption
and
indeed
increased
consumption
of
alcohol.
in
proposing
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
people
of
this
country,
congress
itself
refused
to
include
provisions
which
would
have
vested
congress
with
concurrent
power
to
regulate
or
prohibit
the
sale
of
intoxicating
beverages.
the
record
as
far
as
the
debate
when
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
presented
to
congress,
senator
wagner,
one
of
his
statements
in
that
third
section
that
gave
the
federal
government
concurrent
power,
he
said,
what
we
are
doing
here,
we
are
expelling
the
federal
government
out
of
the
liquor
business
as
far
as
regulating
it,
and
we
are
supposed
to
be
giving
the
states
express
power,
and
then
we're
letting
them
in
the
back
door.
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
is
the
spirit
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
that
was
to
give
the
states
the
power
to
regulate
the
alcohol
and
the
effects
of
alcohol
and
the
incidence
of
alcohol
in
the
state
of
oklahoma,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
feel
like
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
all
about,
and
to
prevent
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
and
that
is
the
federal
government
coming
in
and
telling
the
people
of
oklahoma
that
they
don't
have
the
right
to
regulate
alcohol
or
the
incidence
of
alcohol.
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
we
can't
do
anything
about
it,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
robert
l.
mc
donald
--yes,
but
they
don't
broadcast
in
oklahoma,
so
we
have
no
control.
we
have
always
wondered...
we'd
like
to
try
to
probably
invoke
the
political
process,
and
of
course
the
fcc
recognized
the
analogous
type
of
problem
with
cigarette
advertising,
and
we'd
like
for
the
political
process,
you
know,
some
type
of
situation
where
they
could
help
out
or
have
some
type
of
regulation,
or
congress,
or
seeking
some
type
of
political
solution
to
it,
because
of
the
problems
that
we
are
just
now
recognizing
that
alcohol
causes.
we
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
recognized
oklahoma's
right
to
regulate
themselves
and
chart
the
course
of
their
own
destiny.
thank
you
very
much.
