unknown
speaker
and
allowed
on
tv.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
before
you
sit
down...
maybe
you
answered
this
when
i
was
out
of
the
room...
what
brought
the
attorney
general
in
1980
to
issue
his
advisory
opinion?
why
then?
why
not
before?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
just
an
election
year?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
any
place
in
this
argument
at
all?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
there
a
law
against
liquor
advertisements
in
newspapers?
unknown
speaker
do
you
ever
enforce
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
just
don't
think
you
want
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
taking
liquor
advertisements
out
of
time
magazine?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
that
is
just
because
it
is
too
much
trouble,
just
impractical,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
like
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
it
is
just
impractical
for
cable
operators
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
national
outdoor
advertising
on
signboards?
national
outfits.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
signboards?
unknown
speaker
--so,
to
win,
don't
you
have
to
have
the
federal
communications
commission
rule
invalidated?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
isn't
your
rule
just
in
square
conflict
with
the
fcc
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
so
you
say...
aren't
you
in
effect
saying
that
the
fcc
rule
is
invalid
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
--but
with
the
same
effect,
namely,
the
other
way,
that
you
apply
the
supremacy
clause
the
other
way,
that
oklahoma
has
got
the
right
to
do
this,
and
the
feds
don't.
unknown
speaker
yes.
because
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
you
don't
have
any
budweiser
trucks?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
twenty-first
amendment
would
permit
oklahoma
to
forbid
any
motion
picture
to
be
shown
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
that
involved
drinking
intoxicating
beverages
as
part
of
the
plot
or
by
the
star
or...
because
that
might
easily
stimulate
drinking?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
might
very
well
increase
the
consumption
of
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
if
people
watch
their
favorite
movie
actress
embibe.
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
was
whether
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
prevent
oklahoma
from
having--
unknown
speaker
--because...
in
spite
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
can
regulate
the
paper
there
that
sits
on
the
newsstand.
you
certainly
don't...
it
wouldn't
be
hard
to
keep
that
paper
out
of
oklahoma,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
let
your
own
papers
publish
liquor
ads,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
--would
you
allow
your
papers
to
publish
an
ad
on
behalf
of
a
kansas
liquor
store?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
suppose
the
tenth
circuit
didn't
really
adjudicate
the
preemption
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
raised.
it
was
raised.
was
it
presented
in
the
briefs
to
the
tenth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
an
issue
at
all?
unknown
speaker
before
the
tenth
circuit?
why
did
they
even
mention
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
the
holding
was,
which
it
was,
i
gather,
that
you
weren't
violating
the
first
amendment,
why
didn't
they
have
to
reach
the
preemption
argument
and
say
it
isn't
preempted
either?
wasn't
the
issue
squarely
presented
to
them?
or
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
object
to
the
petitioners
here
relying
on
the
preemption
argument
if
they
didn't
present
it
to
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
of
appeals
just
didn't
adjudicate
it.
unknown
speaker
and
i
would
think
you
would
want
to
embrace
them.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
television
stations
just
across
the
border,
or
radio
stations
just
across
the
border
broadcasting
into
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
it
is
against
your
law,
i
take
it.
