do
you
think
the
federal
law
then
preempts
a
tv
station
just
outside
the
borders
of
oklahoma
from
broadcasting
liquor
advertisements
into
oklahoma,
advertising
the
sale
of
liquor
and
urging
oklahomans
to
come
across
the
border
and
buy
liquor,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
thought
i
asked
whether
the
federal
law
preempted--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
think
it
would
preempt
any
oklahoma
rule
forbidding
cablecasters
to
carry
such
an
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
the
state's
interest
in
keeping
the
liquor
advertisements
out
of
oklahoma
is
just
as
great
with
respect
to
a
broadcaster
as
with
respect
to
a
cablecaster.
they
just
don't
want
the
liquor
advertised
in
oklahoma.
they
don't
want
oklahomans
being
inveigled
to
come
across
the
border
and
load
up
with
some
booze.
the
state's
interest
is
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
tell
me
the
state
doesn't
have
an
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
got
enough
interest
to
be
able
to
keep
a
broadcaster
from
sending
signals
into
oklahoma.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
are
saying
that
the
broadcaster
can
be
kept
out,
but
some
people
who
carry
his
very
signals
can't
be
kept
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
oklahoma
localities
issue
cable
licenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
pursuant
to
the
permission
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
any...
could
any
municipality
just
have
a
rule
that
any
cablecaster
who
carries
a
liquor
advertisement
will
get
his
license
revoked?
justice

is
