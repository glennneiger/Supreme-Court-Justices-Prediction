mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
federal
communcations
commission
has
regulated
the
cable
television
industry
since
the
mid-1960's.
the
consistent
themes
of
that
regulation
have
been
to
encourage
the
widest
availability
and
diversity
of
programming
to
persons
all
across
the
nation
while
ensuring
that
the
position
of
broadcasters,
who
are,
after
all,
the
originators
of
most
programming,
are
not
undercut
by
the
availability
of
the
new
medium.
the
commission's
regulatory
approach
in
this
area
has
been
dictated
in
large
part
by
factors
inherent
to
the
cable
industry,
the
economic
role
of
cable
operators
in
relation
to
broadcasters,
and
the
technological
structure
of
the
cable
systems,
a
matter
which
mr.
rushforth
discussed
in
his
argument.
oklahoma's
law
at
issue
here
is
preempted
by
federal
regulation
because
it
requires
cable
operators
to
do
something
that
the
commission
has
determined
as
an
economic
matter
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
do,
and
that
as
a
technological
matter
they
cannot
feasibly
do,
namely,
to
delete
certain
advertisements
from
the
programming
to
which
those
advertisements
were
attached
by
the
program
originators.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
by
congress.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
because
those
advertisements
do
not
appear
on
any
broadcast
stations,
cable
operators
have
no
problem
deleting
them,
because
they
are
not
there
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
mr.
chief
justice,
so
long
as
the
broadcasters
and
cablecasters
then
move
to
institute
cigarette
advertising,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
preempted
for
precisely
the
same
reasons
that
this
ban
is
preempted.
let
me
discuss--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--the
reasons
are
two.
one
has
to
do
with
the
economics
of
the
cable
industry.
the
other
has
to
do
with
the
technological
structure.
the
economics
drive
from
the
fact
that
cable
operators
receive
their
revenues
from
subscriber
fees,
from
the
homes
that
bring
in
the
cable
networks
to
their
television
sets.
they
receive
no
income
from
the
advertising
that
they
carry.
this
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
broadcasters,
who
receive
no
fees
from
the
persons
who
own
the
television
sets,
but
who
receive
their
revenues
from
the
advertisers.
in
addition,
the
cable
operators
have
no
contractual
relationship
with
the
broadcast
stations
from
which
they
obtain
their
programming.
that
is
to
say,
they
have
no
contract
with
the
station,
they
pay
no
money
to
the
stations,
and
they
have
no
control
over
the
content
of
the
programming
that
the
stations
broadcast.
cable
operators
and
broadcasters
are
able
to
proceed
in
this
fashion
because
there
is
a
certain
conjunction
of
interests
that
the
cable
operators
obtain
free
programming,
which
makes
their
services
more
valuable
to
the
subscribers,
but
at
the
same
time
nationwide
broadcasters
and
cable
networks
expand
their
audience,
thus
enabling
them
to
command
a
higher
price
for
their
advertising,
but
this
conjunction
of
interests
exists
only
so
long
as
the
cable
operators
are
required
to
carry
the
advertising
along
with
the
programming.
if
cable
operators
such
as
those
in
oklahoma
are
enabled
to
delete
the
advertising,
they
become
free
riders.
they
divert
the
listenership
from
the
broadcasters
while
contributing
nothing
to
the
advertising
pool
which
provides
the
financing
to
support
the
programming.
this
economic
structure
is
one
that
congress
studied
and
expressly
adopted
when
it
amended
the
copyright
act
of
1976.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
reasons
for
that
are
that
the
local
broadcaster
is
the
very
person
who
would
receive
the
revenues
from
the
advertising.
there
is
no
third
party
whose
copyright
interests
would
be
infringed
by
the
broadcaster
not
being
permitted
to
carry
the
advertising.
moreover,
the
broadcaster
as
a
technological
matter
simply
broadcasts
one
signal
over
which
he
has
complete
control,
whereas
the
cable
operators
are
broadcasting
a
number
of
signals,
usually
somewhere
between
12
and
30
signals
simultaneously,
and
their
operations
are
simply
not
equipped
even
to
know
what
the
content
of
the
advertising
is,
much
less
to
be
able
to
delete
it
if
they
did
know.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
no,
justice
c'connor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
needs
to
engage
in
balancing,
because
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
states
enhanced
authority
over
the
sale
and
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages.
the
regulation
here
does
not
apply
to
persons
engaged
in
the
sale
or
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages.
it
applies
to
persons
who
are
engaged
in
the
cable
industry,
and
the
regulation
concerns
what
types
of
programming
signals
they
are
able
to
import
into
the
state.
merely
because
that
may
have
an
impact
upon
the
level
of
drinking
or
drunk
driving
in
a
state
does
not
mean
that
the
state
is
able
to
have
enhanced
power
vis-a-vis
the
congress
over
an
unrelated
industry.
this
is
a
structure
which
was
explicitly
adopted
by
congress
as
well
as
the
commission
when
it
determined
that
it
would...
when
congress
set
up
the
compulsory
licensing
scheme.
congress
considered
various
ways
in
which
the
cable
operations
might
be
able
to
solve
the
copyright
problem,
and
concluded
that
a
system
of
individual
contracts
with
various
broadcasters
was
simply
infeasible.
thus
the
broadcasters
pay
a
set
fee
into
a
royalty
pool
which
is
then
divided
among
broadcasters,
and
in
exchange
for
that,
they
are
able
to
pick
up
programming
from
broadcasters
all
over
the
country.
the
most
important
quid
pro
quo
for
being
able
to
pick
up
this
broadcasting,
however,
is
that
they
carry
the
commercials
along
with
the
programming.
this
is
the
main
way
in
which
broadcasters
are
remunerated
for
the
broadcasting
that
they
carry.
the
principal
focus
of
this
case
has
been
on
broadcasters,
but
i
would
just
like
to
add
very
quickly
that
there
is
the
matter
of
cablecasters
as
well,
as
to
which
the
non-deletion
requirements
of
the
statute
and
regulations
not
directly
apply.
however,
the
commission
has
expressly
preempted
the
all
state
and
local
control
over
the
content
of
signal
carriage,
and
the
effect
of
that
has
been
to
protect
the
contractual
arrangements
for
non-deletion
which
are
the
uniform
policy
within
the
industry
from
being
violated
by
state
and
local
requirements
of
this
sort.
precisely
the
same
economic
and
technological
factors
that
make
the
non-deletion
requirements
in
the
broadcast
area
so
compelling
also
apply
in
the
area
of
cablecast.
the
commission
has
recognized
this
quite
explicitly
all
the
way
since
before
cablecast
was
actually
a
practical
reality--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--is
your
question,
does
the
oklahoma
law
forbid,
say,
a
kansas
station
from
broadcasting?
i
think
not.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
the
federal
law
does
not
preempt
any
restrictions
upon
advertising
by
broadcasters.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
they
are
not
originating
the
programming.
they
are
retransmitting
programming
signals
that
they
are
receiving
from
broadcasters
or
cablecasters.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
the
technical
problem
is
merely
one
of
two
important
considerations
that
the
commission
and
congress
considered
in
adopting
a
scheme
which
depends
upon
a
non-deletion
requirement.
the
expense
and
change
and
structure
of
the
cable
broadcasting
system
that
would
be
entailed
by
obedience
to
the
sort
of
rule
that
we
have
here
would
be
quite
significant,
and
would
seriously
retard
the
ability
of
cable
systems
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
state's
authority
is
not
enhanced
with
respect
to
industries
other
than
those
involved
in
the
sale
and
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages,
but
even
were
that
not
true,
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
apply
a
balancing
test,
we
are
quite
confident
that
the
concerns
of
the
congress
and
the
commission
would
far
outweigh
the
marginal
gains
to
the
state's
interests
from
enforcement
of
this
law.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
your
honor,
the
difference--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--yes,
it
is.
the
difference
between--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--your
honor,
it
is
not
that
the
state
does
not
have
an
interest.
the
important
point
here
is
that
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--and
the
difference
is
that
neither
congress
nor
the
commission
have
promulgated
rules
and
statutes
that
preempt--
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
--that's
right,
your
honor.
let
me
add
that
cable,
cable
systems
insofar
as
they
are
originators
of
programming
within
oklahoma
might
be
subject
to
the
identical
rules.
that
also
is
not
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
difference
is
not
so
much
cable
versus
broadcast
as
it
is
the
economic
and
technical
structure
here
wherein
the
cable
operators
are
carrying
other
people's
programming
and
are
obligated
to
carry
with
it
the
commercials
that
pay
for
it.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mc
connell
thank
you.
