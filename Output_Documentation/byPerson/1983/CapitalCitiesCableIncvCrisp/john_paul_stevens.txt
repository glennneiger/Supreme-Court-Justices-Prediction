the
difference,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
in
one
case
there
is
a
conflict
with
a
federal
rule,
and
in
the
other
case
there
isn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
mcdonald,
you
also
contend,
as
i
understand
you,
that
the
copyright
act
is
unconstitutional
in
order
to
avoid
that
conflict.
the
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
so
for
you
to
prevail,
we
have
to
hold
both
the
federal
statute
and
the
fcc
rule
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
applied
to
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
your
regulation
apply
to
a
kansas
newspaper,
say,
a
borderline
town
that
is
right
on
the
border
between
oklahoma
and
kansas
and
wants
to
advertise,
urging
people
to
come
across
the
state
line
and
buy
some
liquor
in
kansas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
talking
about
the
distribution
in
oklahoma
of
such
ads
directed
at
oklahoma
people,
soliciting
their
patronage
to
come
across
the
state
line
and
get
some
of
the
good
kansas
beer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't...
you
wouldn't
contend--
