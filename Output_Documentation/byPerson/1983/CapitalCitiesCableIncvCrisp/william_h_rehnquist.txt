justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
argument
ever
made
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
it
the
broadcasters
or
the
cable
tv
people
that
are
not...
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
federal
preemption
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then,
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit,
did
the
cable
people
whom
you
represent
urge
the
federal
preemption
ground
as
an
independent
or
an
alternative
ground
for
upholding
the
judgment
of
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
district...
was
there
evidence
taken
on
these
subjects
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
testimony,
is
this
testimony
in
open
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
a
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
testimony
that
the
district
court
made
its
finding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
some
cable
tv
operator
chose
to
run
some
commercials
about
murder
for
hire
in
oklahoma,
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
says,
no,
it
is
against
our
laws
to
have
that
kind
of
commercial
on,
so
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
show
it
in
oklahoma,
and
you
say,
well,
look
at
all
the
good
stuff
people
are
missing
because
we
just
can't
delete
those
commercials
from
the
channel
we
have
taken
them
from.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
in
that
kind
of
a
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
then,
that
oklahoma's
ban
on
advertising
of
liquor
simply
can't
pass
the
test
for
commercial
speech,
quite
apart
from
its
appearance
on
cable
television?
what
if
oklahoma
says,
you
can't
put
up
billboards
advertising
liquor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
does
the
state
always
just
have
to
take
the
whole
thing
just
as
the
cable
operators
put
it
together
because
the
cable
operators
argue
that
they
can't
screen
out
the
commercials?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
state's
interest?
the
state
presumably
wants
to
discourage
consumption
of
hard
liquor,
and
the
theory
on
which
advertisers
spend
money
is
presumably
that
the
money
they
spend
is
going
to
increase
their
sales.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
fault
the
state
of
oklahoma
for
that
approach.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you
say
they
are
carrying
it
just
because
they
can't
sever
out
the--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
evidence
did
he
make
that
finding
on?
is
that
just
his
hunchback?
or,
his
hunch?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
said
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
that
texas
election
case
two
terms
ago,
that
the
state
can
address
one
part
of
an
evil
at
a
time.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
across
the
board,
and
its
actions
are
simply
not
subject
to
that
sort
of
a
comparison,
that
if
you
really
meant
this
you
would
have
taken
step
b
as
well
a
step
a.
the
state
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
trial
court
conceive
the
state's
interest
to
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
isn't
the
state's
interest
exactly
what
the
oklahoma
legislature
said
it
was,
or
the
oklahoma
people
when
they
ratified
the
constitution,
that
we
are
interested
in
not
having
liquor
advertised
on
television?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mcconnell,
the
fcc
doesn't
protect
broadcasters
in
the
oklahoma
situation,
does
it?
they
can
be
required
so
far
as
the
fcc
is
concerned
not
to
carry
liquor
advertising
in
oklahoma?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
do
let
the
new
york
times
publish
them
when--
