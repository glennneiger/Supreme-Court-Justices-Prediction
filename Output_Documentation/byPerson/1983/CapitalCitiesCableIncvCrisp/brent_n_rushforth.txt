mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
presents
a
challenge
to
oklahoma's
requirement
that
cable
tv
operators
delete
wine
advertising
from
programming
they
bring
into
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
district
court
found
that
it
is
infeasible
for
cable
tv
operators
to
delete
the
advertising
from
their
programming.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
that
finding.
indeed,
it
emphasized
the
finding
by
stating
that
oklahoma's
advertising
ban
would
place
cable
tv
operators
in
a
particularly
difficult
position.
the
crux
of
this
case
is
the
crushing
economic
burden,
the
technical
infeasibility
and
the
illegality
under
federal
law
to
delete
advertising
from
a
multitude
of
program
signals
that--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--the
technical
difficulty,
justice
brennan,
is
that
the
cable
tv
operators
get
no
notice
regarding
the
time
or
content
of
the
advertising
signals
in
their
programming.
contrary
to
broadcasters,
cable
tv
operators
pick
up
signals
as
they
find
them
over
the
air
or
over
satellite,
and
they
receive
no
notice
of
advertising.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
there
is
a
very
marked
difference,
your
honor,
between
cable
tv
operators
and
broadcasters.
an
affiliate
of
a
network
station
in
oklahoma
receives
a
great
deal
of
advance
notice
regarding
the
advertising
that
will
be
on
that
network
feed
from
new
york
city
or
wherever
it
comes
from.
not
only
do
they
receive
notice,
but
through
the
affiliation
agreement
with
the
network,
they
have
control
over
the
signal.
they
can
delete
advertising
as
they
see
fit,
and
further,
they
have--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--by
not
receiving
notice,
your
honor,
the
cable
tv
operator
would
be
required
to
station
one
employee
at
some
monitor
for
each
signal
coming
in
to
the
cable
tv
operator.
there
are
a
multitude
of
signals
coming--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--there
is
no
technical
reason
why
they
could
not
furnish
the
information,
your
honor.
if
the
cablecasters
were
to
give
notice
to
cable
tv
operators,
nevertheless,
the
cable
tv
operators
would
be
in
a
position,
having
a
multitude
of
signals
coming
in
simultaneously,
of
placing
an
employee
at
each
of
those
signals,
one
for
each
signal,
and
without
full
notice
of
what
is
in
that
signal,
it
cannot
be
done
automatically.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
the
technology
is
simply
not
there.
this
must
be
done
manually.
we
are
dealing
here
in
terms
of
seconds,
not
in
terms
of
minutes,
and
unless
they
have
full
notice
as
to
what
is
in
the
advertising,
when
it
is
going
to
come
precisely,
then
they
will
have
to
wait
a
number
of
seconds
before
they
even
know
what
is
in
the
advertising,
and
they
would
have
to
delete
it
manually.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
well,
if
the
cable
tv
operator
wishes
to
carry
programs
from
television
stations,
then
as
congress
found,
the
only
feasible
way
for
the
cable
tv
operator
to
do
that
is
to
participate
in
the
compulsory
licensing
scheme.
i
wish
to
emphasize
here
that
many
of
the
tv
signals
picked
up
by
cable
television
operators
are
so-called
reluctant
television
stations.
there
is
no
economic
incentive
for
television
stations
to
cooperate
with
cable
tv
operators,
and
indeed
many
of
them
have
expressly
stated
they
will
not
so
cooperate.
so
that
in
order,
as
congress
found,
in
order
for
the
cable
tv
operator
to
carry
this
type
of
program,
which
is,
of
course,
the
kind
of
programming
most
interesting
to
its
subscribers,
the
only
feasible
way
for
the
cable
tv
operator
to
do
that
is
by
participating
in
the
compulsory
licensing
scheme.
now,
oklahoma
permits
the
sale
and
consumption
of
wine
within
the
state.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
they
could
exclude
it,
but
they
do
not.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so.
we
believe
that
no
case,
no
decision
of
this
court
holds
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
includes
the
power
to
ban
interstate
advertising
by
someone
not
a
liquor
licensee
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
well,
we
believe...
no,
they
could
not,
your
honor.
oklahoma
until
1980
did
not
apply
its
advertising
ban
to
cable
tv
operators.
in
that
year,
abandoning
a
decade's
practice,
the
attorney
general
of
oklahoma
held
that
the
advertising
ban
would
apply
to
cable
tv
operators.
the
district
court
found
that
by
applying
the
advertising
ban
to
cable
tv,
the
state
would
not
directly
advance
its
interest
in
promoting
temperance.
to
the
contrary,
the
district
court
found
that
in
light
of
the
pervasive
advertising
in
newspapers,
magazines,
and
other
media,
and
beer
advertising
that
is
pervasive
throughout
the
state--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--and
allowed
on
tv.
that
all
this
incremental
advertising
on
cable
would
do
is
inform
oklahomans
of
what
they
already
knew
from
other
sources.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
those
findings,
but
in
the
face
of
them,
deferred
to
the
legislative
judgment
of
oklahoma,
and
upheld
the
advertising
ban
as
it
applies
to
cable
tv.
it
did
so
because
it
misinterpreted
this
court's
decisions
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
oklahoma
rests
its
entire
case
on
the
proposition
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
empowers
it
not
only
to
regulate
or
ban
the
importation,
transportation
of
wine
into
the
state
of
oklahoma,
but
also
to
ban
interstate
advertising
by
someone
who
is
not
a
liquor
licensee,
but
who
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
communication.
no
decision
of
this
court
has
so
held.
to
the
contrary,
this
court's
decisions
have
limited
the
scope
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
in
the
case
of
california
liquor
retail
dealers
association
versus
midcal
aluminum,
this
court
held
that
even
in
the
area
of
liquor
commerce,
the
federal
government
retains
a
substantial
interest,
and
in
that
case,
the
court
struck
down
a
california
retail
pricing
scheme.
the
court
said
that
the
state's
interest
in
that
scheme
was
unsubstantiated
and
far
outweighed
by
the
federal
government's
interest
in
maintaining
competition.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
i
think,
your
honor,
it
does
when
we
are
talking
about
the
area
of
liquor
commerce.
when
we
go
beyond
that
area,
as
we
certainly
do
here,
because
the
impact
of
the
state's
regulation
is
upon
people
not
engaged
in
liquor
commerce,
but
people
engaged
in
an
entirely
different
element
of
commerce,
then
this
court's
decisions
in
craig
versus
boren
and
in
larkin
versus
grendel's
den,
for
example,
say
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
alter
constitutional
analysis.
here,
there
is
a
pervasive,
a
comprehensive
federal
scheme
of
regulation
of
cable
television.
its
purpose
is
to
ensure
that
cable
television
becomes
an
integral
part
of
a
national
communications
network.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
the
argument
regarding
preemption
of
oklahoma's
statute
by
federal
law
was
in
the
complaint,
and
the
trial
judge
made
a
finding
in
his
findings
upholding
his
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction
that
cable
tv
operators
could
not
comply
both
with
state
and
federal
law.
the
reason
the
trial
court
judge
decided
the
summary
judgment
motion
on
first
amendment
grounds
as
opposed
to
preemption
grounds,
i
believe,
was
because
he
asked
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue
those
elements
in
the
case
that
were
common
to
both
the
broadcasters
and
the
cable
tv
operators,
and
that
meant
he
wanted
briefing
of
the
first
amendment
issue,
because
by
that
time
the
broadcasters
were
with
us.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
the
broadcasters,
your
honor,
may
have
a
federal
preemption
argument,
but
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
argument.
it
is
not
the
argument
that
we
present
here.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
we
urged
upon
the
court
of
appeals
in
defense
of
the
district
court's
ruling
primarily
first
amendment
grounds.
in
a
motion
for
rehearing,
we
did
urge
the
court
to
consider
all
the
issues
before
the
trial
court,
and
then,
of
course,
as
your
honor
knows,
this
court
requested
us
to
brief
and
argue
the
issues
of
preemption.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
if
i
may
point
to
the
record
before
the
district
court,
the
district
court
explicitly
asked
the
parties
whether
they
wished
any
further
factual
evidence
placed
into
the
record,
and
both
parties,
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
my
clients,
suggested
that
they
did
not
wish
more
evidence,
and
on
that
record
the
district
court
made
certain
findings,
including
which
are
findings
that
cable
tv
operators
here
cannot
comply
with
both
state
and
federal
law.
included
in
those
findings
is
a
finding
that
the
advertising
ban
goes
beyond
the
place
where
it
needs
to
go
to--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--there
is
evidence,
your
honor,
before
the
district
court,
testimony
in
the
record--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
and
it
is
included
in
the
joint
appendix.
it
includes
testimony
on
the
technical
infeasibility
and
the
economic
infeasibility
of
this
rule
as
it
applies
to
cable
tv
operators.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
that's
correct.
this
pervasive
federal
scheme
is
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
the
development
of
cable
television.
here,
there
is
no
dispute
that
there
is
a
direct
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law.
indeed,
the
deletion
of
advertising
that
oklahoma
seeks
would
constitute
copyright
infringement
under
the
copyright
act,
would
subject
the
cable
tv
operator
to
criminal
and
civil
penalties,
and
would
force
him
to
lose
the
compulsory
license.
it
would
also
directly
conflict
with
rules
of
the
federal
communications
commission
requiring
that
television
signals
carried
by
cable
tv
operators
not
delete
advertising.
in
these
circumstances,
this
court's
decisions
compel
that
the
state
law
must
give
way.
the
oklahoma
advertising
ban
also
must
fall
under
the
principles
of
the
first
amendment.
it
follows
directly
from
the
district
court
finding
that
the
advertising
ban
here
will
operate
to
restrain
programming
classically
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
news,
entertainment,
sports
programming,
with
a
broad
array
of
cultural,
artistic,
and
informational
content
that
is
classically
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
the
state
has
not
come
close
to
sustaining
the
burden
that
it
must
sustain
in
order
to
restrict
and
restrain
such
programs.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
well,
your
honor,
certainly
if
that
were
the
situation,
it
would
not
pass
the
tests
that
this
court
has
established
for
the
protection
of
commercial
speech.
it
would
violate
the
first
principle
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
central
hudson
case,
because
it
would
be
about
activity
that
is
illegal,
and
so
in
that
sense
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
protection.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
well,
if
the
advertising
were
intrastate,
your
honor,
no
decision
of
this
court
has
included
within
the
power
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
ban
that
kind
of
advertising,
but
it
would
be
a
very
different
case
from
the
one
we
are
involved
with
here.
here,
we
are
dealing,
as
this
court
stated
in
metromedia,
with
the
law
of
cable
television,
and
there
are
very
special
considerations
that
apply
because
of
the
effect
this
ban
has
not
only
on
the
commercial
speech
but
on
the
non-commercial
programming
carried
by
cable
tv
operators.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think,
in
the
situation
where
the
advertising
ban
were
addressed
to
something
that
were
illegal
under
oklahoma
law,
then
that
advertising
would
not
be
entitled
to
protection
under
the
central
hudson
test.
there
are
also
situations
that
would,
of
course,
be
illegal
under
federal
law,
and
under
those
circumstances
there
could
be
a
federal
ban
upon
the
advertising
that
may
be
able
to
pass
the
central
hudson
test
and
may
not
in
fact
restrain
non-commercial
speech.
this
is
a
situation,
however,
in
which
not
only
does
the
advertising
ban
restrain
non-commercial
speech
because
of
the
economics
and
technology
of
cable
television,
but
it
also
is
an
advertising
ban
that
does
not
pass
the
tests
established
by
this
court
in
central
hudson.
it
goes
too
far.
it
is
not
directly
related
to
the
state's
interest,
as
the
trial
court
found,
and
this
court
has
never
held--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--your
honor,
i
would
like
to
say
two
things
about
that.
first,
cable
tv
operators
derive
no
revenue
whatever
from
wine
advertising.
they
have
no
direct
relationship
with
wine
advertising.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
that's
correct.
secondly,
your
honor,
and
more
importantly,
the
district
court's
finding
states
very
clearly
that
the
incremental
advertising
on
cable
tv
in
the
face
of
advertising
on
other
media,
in
newspapers,
in
magazines,
cannot
do
anything
but
inform
oklahomans
of
what
they
already
know
and
will
not
advance
the
state's
interest.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
he
made
that
finding
on
the
evidence
that
oklahoma
does
not
ban
advertising
for
wine
from
the
new
york
times
as
it
comes
into
the
state
of
oklahoma.
no
one
is
suggesting
here,
your
honor,
that
someone
be
sitting
at
the
border
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
clipping
wine
advertising
from
the
new
york
times.
no
one
is
suggesting--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--well,
the
trial
court
found,
your
honor,
after
an
examination
of
the
record,
including
the
fact
that
beer
advertising
is
pervasive
throughout
the
state,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
application
of
this
rule
to
cable
television
would
not
directly
advance
the
state's
interest,
and
it
is--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--the
trial
court
conceived
the
state's
interest
to
be
the
promotion
of
temperance,
the
prevention
of
drunk
driving--
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
--your
honor,
this
court's
line
of
cases
ending
last
term
with
bolger
sets
out
clearly
who
has
the
burden
to
sustain
a
showing,
and
the
state
simply
has
not
complied
with
those
requirements
here.
thank
you.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
we
frankly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
is
a
requirement
that
when
a
state
senator,
as
i
understand
it,
when
a
state
senator
makes
a
request
to
the
attorney
general,
the
attorney
general
has
some
obligation
to
respond,
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
brent
n.
rushforth
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that.
