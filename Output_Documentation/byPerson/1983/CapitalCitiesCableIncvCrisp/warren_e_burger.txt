cable
against
richard

crisp.
mr.
rushforth,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
could
exclude
it,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
exclude
all
advertising?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could

exclude
all
cable
operations?
chief

e.

counsel,
your
friend
is
coming
first.
he
has
ten
minutes.
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
cigarette
advertising?
that
is
banned
on
television
by
the
commission,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
by
congress,
and
the
commission
oversees
that,
monitors
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh.
that
was
a
preface
to
the
question
i
put
to
you
now.
could
a
state,
if
congress
lifted
that
limitation
on
cigarette
advertising
on
broadcasting,
could
a
state
say,
no,
we
like
it
the
way
it
is,
and
we
will
tolerate
no
advertising
of
cigarettes
on
television
or
radio?
or
would
you
say
that
is
preempted,
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
go
to
the
fundamental
question
that
justice
white
put
to
you?
how
does
that
technical
problem
go
to
the
fundamental
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mcdonald?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
they
thought
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
couldn't
be
preempted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
a
number
of
old
cases
that
have
held
here
that
we
will
not
let
a
case
turn
on
an
issue
not
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
