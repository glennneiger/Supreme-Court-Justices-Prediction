mr.
simms,
on
the
first
point
and
the
way
in
which
water
can
be
augmented,
how
can
new
mexico
legitimately
claim
that
nonuse
over
a
thirty-year
period
never
becomes
in
effect
an
abandonment
of
the
use
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
water?
is
it
your
position
that
new
mexico
can
never
by
nonuse
lose
the
right
to
use
the
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
going
back
to
the
supply
side
question
again,
mr.
simms,
for
a
minute,
what
did
the
master
do
about
the
peak
flows
and
the
floods
in
his
calculations
of
water
availability
in
the
vermejo?
how
did
he
resolve
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
did
his
use
of
the
average
availability
figures
in
effect
get
used
twice,
once
in
the
supply
figures
and
once
in
the
excused
nonuse
calculations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
because
they
are
not
lined
with
concrete
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
might
be
quite
uneconomical.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
welborn,
why
did
the
master
refuse
to
admit
into
evidence
recent
usgs
stream
flow
measurements
so
that
there
could
be
a
clearer
picture
of
the
available
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
won't
that
ten-year
progressive
average
you
suggest
increase
the
divertable
quantity
to
colorado
beyond
the
master's
recommendation?
it
looks
to
me
like
it
would.
