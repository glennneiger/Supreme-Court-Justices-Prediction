mr.
simms,
let
me
interrupt
if
i
may
for
a
moment.
the
master
in
dealing
with
the
finding
of
drought
says
new
mexico
claims
that
the
nonuse
on
the
part
of
the
district
is
caused
by
the
drought
in
the
early
seventies.
however,
the
drought
in
the
1970's
cannot
be
responsible
for
the
nonuse
which
has
existed
in
the
district
since
its
formation
in
the
fifties,
nonuse
through
a
time
period
when
all
of
the
other
users
in
evidence
from
flow
tables
found
sufficient
water
available.
so
he
is
finding
for
a
substantial
period
before
what
you
say
was
the
drought.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
good
deal
more
water
available
than
was
being
used
for
the
first
ten
years
after
the
district
was
rejuvenated
or
whatever
word
is
proper,
would
there
have
been
an
excuse
for
the
district
not
using
it
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
just
being
developed?
that
is
mr.
simms'
point
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
assume
that
from
'55
to
'65
there
was
plenty
of
water
to
meet
the
district's
supposed
demand,
but
they
did
not
use
it.
that
is
what
you
are
saying
is
the
case.
mr.
simms'
response
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
district
was
in
a
period
of
development
so
that
is
excusable.
is
that
his
point
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
say
from
the
time
this
grace
period
ended
up
until
the
drought
period
they
were
not
irrigating
any
more
than
they
did
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
welborn,
another
point.
suppose
that
there
is
really
a
severe
drought
period,
and
i
take
it
if
colorado
wins
this
case
if
there
are
4,000
acre-feet
of
water
in
the
river
in
colorado
above...
at
the
point
of
your
hoped-for
diversion
you
would
get
that
4,000
feet
no
matter
what
the
consequence
was
on
lower
river
users.
in
short,
you
would
never
have
to
share
the
drought
effect.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
there
would
be
that
much
water
for
you
to
take.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
quite
understand
that.
how
much
average
water
is
in
the
vermejo
at
your
diversion
point?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
want
to
take
4,000
acre-feet
of
that?
unknown
speaker
leaving
on
the
average
700
acre-feet
in
the
river?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
in
any
event,
as
long
as
there
is
more
than
4,000...
well,
whatever
water
is
in
the
vermejo
at
your
diversion
point
you
can
take
4,000
feet
of
it.
unknown
speaker
you
can
take
it
all
if
there
is
only
3,000.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
is
the
reason
you
objected
to
it,
or
did
you
object?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting
that
new
mexico
water
laws
require
to
disallow
water
rights
to
part-time
farmers
are
you?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
special
master
find?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ever
find
how
much
had
been
diverted
to
the
stock
water
system
or
how
much
might
be
saved
by
a
closed
system?
unknown
speaker
how
much
water
upstream
would
790--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
agree
with
his
formula.
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
then
agree
with
their
two-for-one
ratio
if
i
understand.
maybe
i
misunderstand
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
not
suggest,
i
am
sure,
that
a
conservation
measure
would
increase
your
water
allocation.
unknown
speaker
they
may
have
a
historic
reliance,
but
that
is
only
because
there
is
water
running
past
the
district.
yet
the
vermejo
is
completely
adjudicated.
unknown
speaker
that
includes
the
flood
periods.
