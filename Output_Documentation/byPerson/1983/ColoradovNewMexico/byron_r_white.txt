mr.
welborn,
what
about
mr.
simms'
point
that
their
underutilization
in
the
sixties
or
from
'55
for
ten
years
was
excusable
because
it
was
a
period
of
development?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
welborn,
what
about
mr.
simms'
argument
that
the
secial
master's
analysis,
he
just
looked
at
the
supply
side
and
really
did
not
follow
the
water
down
the
river
to
the
district,
did
not
deal
with
the
demand?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
part
of
your
argument
that
the
uses
of
vermejo
water
in
the
canadian
river
should
prevent
an
allocation
to
colorado?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
that
does
not
answer
my
question.
