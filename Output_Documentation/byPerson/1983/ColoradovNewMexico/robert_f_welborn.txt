mr.
robert
f.
welborn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
set
forth
two
basic
principles
or
considerations
that
apply
particularly
to
this
case:
first,
that
reasonable
conservation
measures
in
one
state
may
offset
the
effect
of
a
diversion,
a
new
diversion,
in
another
state;
secondly,
that
benefits
in
one
state
may
outweigh
harm
in
another
state.
it
is
colorado's
position
that
the
special
master
has
found
and
that
the
evidence
fully
supports
the
conclusion
that
reasonable
conservation
measures
in
new
mexico
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
for
example,
would
and
in
fact
already
have
offset
the
effect
of
a
colorado
diversion
and
further
that
if
there
should
be
any
residual
harm
to
new
mexico,
which
colorado
does
not
believe
there
would
be,
that
this
harm
would
be
outweighed
by
benefits
to
colorado.
the
conservation
measure
that
has
already
been
completed
is
one
of
the
most
blatant
cases
of
waste
that
there
could
be.
it
results
from
the
district
stock
water
system
procedure.
that
procedure
is
fully
described
in
our
briefs,
of
course,
and
in
new
mexico's
own
exhibit
e-3.
the
district
released
annually
over
2,000
acre-feet
of
water
from
its
reservoirs
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
water
for
livestock.
the
livestock
consumed
about
35
acre-feet
of
water
a
year.
so
as
you
can
see
there
was
over
a
98
percent
loss
of
water.
this
waste
continued
during
the
period
that
the
district
complained
of
a
water
shortage.
it
has
now
as
of
last
year
been
eliminated
by
the
installation
of
a
closed
stock
water
system...
i
should
say
closed
water
system...
because
the
main
thrust
really
of
this
new
water
system
as
explained
in
this
new
mexico
exhibit
e-3
is
to
supply
domestic
water.
that
was
how
it
apparently
got
started,
to
supply
water
to
20
homes
and
then
it
expanded.
but
this
saving
of
2,000
acre-feet
of
water
at
the
reservoirs
will
completely
offset
the
effect
of
the
colorado
diversion
of
4,000
acre-feet
at
the
river.
the
reason
for
that
is
mathematically
very
simple.
it's
based
on
testimony
of
new
mexico
officials,
uncontested
testimony,
uncontested
evidence,
that
the
losses
from
the
reservoirs
to
the
farm
headgates
are
approximately
one-third.
the
losses
from
the
river
to
the
farm
headgates
due
to
the
system
going
through
the
reservoirs,
the
canal
system
from
the
river
to
the
reservoirs,
the
losses
there
are
approximately
two-thirds
so
that
you
can
see
2,000
acre-feet
with
a
one-third
loss
is
equivalent
to
4,000
acre-feet
with
a
two-thirds
loss.
this
extreme
waste
of
this
water
in
this
method
of
supplying
water
to
livestock
over
the
entire
period
of
the
district's
existence
until
last
year
did
not
even
constitute
under
law
a
beneficial
use,
an
existing
use
which
should
be
recognized.
the
jicarilla
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
dealt
with
a
93
percent
loss,
an
incredible
loss
of
water
at
the
elephant
butte
reservoir
below
the
city
of
albuquerque.
the
tenth
circuit
applied
new
mexico
law
and
found
that
that
93
percent
loss
did
not
constitute
a
beneficial
use.
this
court
in
this
case
justice
o'connor
has
referred
to
the
need
for
reasonable
and
beneficial
use
of
a
water
right.
in
washington
v.
oregon
the
court
said
before
they
concluded
that
oregon
should
have
this
water
said,
"we
better
look
at
this
use
and
see
if
there
is
waste.
"
they
looked
specifically.
they
used
the
words
"beneficial
use".
so
here
we
have
a
conservation
measure
that
is
complete.
the
feasibility
of
it
is
proved.
now
the
special
master
was
completely
correct
in
placing
emphasis
on
water
administration.
water
administration
is
the
key
to
water
in
the
western
states.
it
is
the
other
half.
a
water
right
is
one
half,
but
it
is
not
worth
anything
really
if
there
is
not
water
administration
to
back
it
up.
that
is
why
the
special
master,
an
experienced
judge,
an
experienced
water
attorney,
really,
who
represented
the
state
of
wyoming
in
wyoming
v.
colorado
in
one
phase
of
that
case,
that
is
why
he
focused
in
all
of
these
respects
on
this
matter
of
administration.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
the
colorado
diversion...
there
are
two
or
three
factors
there,
justice
rehnquist.
the
colorado
diversion
would
take
place
at
a
point
within
the
colorado
production
which
would
mean
that
colorado
would
take
only
approximately
one
half
of
its
production
so
that
it
would
be
only
take
a
half
of
the
colorado
production
and
as
the
special
master
found
only
about
a
third
or
a
fourth
of
the
total
vermejo
river
production.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
it
is,
yes,
but
it
is
made
up
also
of
water
coming
in
below
the
border,
and
as
i
say
colorado
contributes
roughly
half
to
the
total
figure.
for
example,
the
new
mexico
witness,
mr.
moots,
testified
that
the
colorado
production
was
approximately
5,500
acre-feet
a
year
on
the
average,
and
you
relate
that
with
the
dawson
gauge
with
an
average
of
some
11,000
acre-feet
a
year.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
in
such
a
year
from
here
on,
justice
rehnquist,
the
district
will
be
completely
protected
for
this
reason,
the
stock
water
situation,
which
has
now
as
a
result
of
recent
developments
come
to
fruition,
but
the
district
gave
first
priority
according
to
its
own
witness,
mr.
moots,
in
his
testimony
gave
first
priority
to
the
stock
water.
they
save
water
in
their
reservoirs.
they
release
water
from
their
reservoirs
first
for
the
stock
water.
they
held
water
in
the
reservoirs
as
against
irrigation
usage
so
that
they
would
have
enough
for
the
stock
water
usage.
so
this
conservation
measure
that
has
taken
place
would
completely
protect,
as
against
the
past
situation,
completely
protect
even
in
a
low
year.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
i
would
suggest
this,
justice
rehnquist.
the
district...
this
gets
to
another
point
that
has
been
made
here...
deals
entirely
with
reservoirs,
and
the
district
is
entitled
to
take
all
of
the
water
in
the
vermejo
river
at
its
diversion
point
and
indeed
has
taken
most
of
the
water
in
the
river
during
the
30-year
period.
so
there
have
not
been
significant
spills
from
1950
to
1979.
the
reservoir
system
of
the
district
as
shown
by
new
mexico's
own
exhibits
allows
the
carry
over
of
water
from
one
year
to
the
next.
now
at
the
last
hearing
in
this
case
justice
white
asked
if
there
were
a
five-year
period
of
low
water
would
that
not
be
a
problem.
i
suggest
to
you
that,
first,
again
i
cannot
emphasize
strongly
enough
the
conservation
measures
that
have
been
now
perfected
by
the
district,
but
even
if
there
were
a
period
of
over
one
year
of
low
flow
the
district
would
not
be
suffering
as
compared
with
what
it
has
in
the
past
because
it
has
now
conserved
this
water.
another
element
of
conservation
as
far
as
the
district
is
concerned
is
revealed
in
exhibit
41,
and
the
special
master
alludes
to
this,
and
that
is
the
loss
of
water
in
its
canals
in
its
lateral
system.
exhibit
41
is
a
bureau
of
reclamation
report
on
a
meeting
between
state
and
district
officials,
and
they
were
discussing...
this
was
in
the
later
part
of
the
seventies...
they
were
discussing
the
possibility
of
administration
on
the
vermejo
river
and
specifically
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
they
did
not
go
ahead
with
administration,
but
in
that
report
it
is
said
that
if
there
were
administration
the
district
would
have
to
be
charged
with
waste
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
water
in
its
canals
and
laterals.
the
definite
plan
report
put
out
by
the
bureau
before
this
thing
got
started
showed...
their
estimate
was
a
loss
of
25
percent
in
the
canals
and
laterals.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
there
is
no
particular
testimony
except
that
the
silting
in
the
canals
and
the
debris
that
seems
to
collect
in
the
canals.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
requirement
that
they
be
lined
with
concrete.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
no,
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that,
and
in
this
report
it
is
simply
the
matter
of
cleaning
up
the
canals.
but
the
district
usage
which
has
been
referred
to
earlier
and
which
the
special
master
found
was
really
basic...
it
is
basically
its
average
usage...
is
supported
by
the
record.
mr.
simms
suggests
that
the
district
was
just
getting
going
up
to
1965,
but
as
shown
by
new
mexico's
own
exhibit
which
is
at
page
12
of
new
mexico's
last
brief
the
year
of
highest
irrigation
was
prior
to
1965.
now
new
mexico
in
its
brief
on
remand
represented
to
the
special
master...
this
was
after
it
was
remanded
to
him
for
the
additional
findings...
represented
to
the
special
master
that
the
period
prior
to
the
seventies
was
a
period
of
stable
supply
for
irrigation.
those
are
new
mexico's
very
words
in
its
brief.
so
the
special
master
was
eminently
justified
in
noting
in
his
additional
findings
that
new
mexico
contended
that
the
period
of
the
seventies
was
a
drought
period.
he
did
not
necessarily
accept
that,
but
he
noted
that
even
prior
to
that
period
the
district
did
not
irrigate
substantially
more
water.
the
average
acreage
irrigated
for
the
total
period
of
the
district
operation
was
4,379.
for
the
1960's
i
think
it
was
about
4,500,
and
for
the
1950's
it
was
about
4,400
so
that
you
can
see--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--well,
i
suggest,
justice
white,
that
there
was
not...
according
to
this
table,
this
new
mexico
exhibit,
there
was
not
any
underutilization
then
as
compared
with
the
later
period
based
on
the
acreage
irrigated.
there
is
an
exhibit,
a
bureau
of
reclamation
exhibit--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--during
all
this
period
they
were,
as
i
say,
giving
preference
to
be
sure
they
had
at
least
2,000
acre-feet
to
release--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
believe
that
is
his
point,
but
their
own
exhibit
which
is
on
page
12
of
their
brief
shows
they
irrigated
as
much
prior
to
'65
as
they
did
after
'65.
the
dawson
gauge
figures...
the
dawson
gauge
it
has
been
suggested
is
an
average
figure
and
so
forth,
but
it
gives
monthly
figures--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--no.
no,
they
were
not
appreciably.
the
total
average
was
4,379.
the
average
for
the
sixties
was,
i
think,
around
4,500,
and
for
the
fifties
it
was
around
4,400.
the
dawson
gauge
figures,
which
are
a
real
guide
mark
as
to
the
water
available
to
the
district
because
the
district
can
take
all
the
water
below
the
dawson
gauge
with
the
exception
of
the
senior
priorities
of
phelps
dodge
and
those
five
people
that
take
off
the
district
canal...
the
testimony
is
that
those
diverters
all
of
whom
are
senior
to
the
district
with
the
one
exception
of
mr.
porter
take
about
as
much
as
the
accretion
from
the
dawson,
below
the
dawson
gauge
to
the
district
point
of
diversion.
considering
the
fact
that
the
district
has
these
reservoirs,
that
there
were
no
appreciable
spills
past
the
district
head
gauge
in
the
thirty-year
period
from
'50
to
'79
except
in
two
years,
considering
that,
the
dawson
gauge
figure
tells
you
what
the
district
not
only
should
have
gotten
but
what
the
district
did
get.
now
the
dawson
gauge
average
for
the
fifties
was
something,
9,900
acre-feet
a
year.
the
average
for
the
sixties
was
11,000
acre-feet
per
year.
the
average
for
the
seventies
was
8,000
acre-feet
per
year.
so
you
can
see
there
is
not
a
great
variation
there.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
on
the
assumption
that
during
the
drought
there
would
be
4,000
acre-feet
at
the
diversion
point,
but
if
there
were
a
drought
there
would
not
be
4,000
acre-feet,
i
suggest,
at
the
colorado
diversion
point
because
everyone
would
share
in
the
lower
figure
as
well
as
the
higher
figure.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
at
the
diversion
point
the
new
mexico
testimony
was
that
it
is
3,360
acre-feet
a
year
on
the
average.
the
colorado
testimony
was
that
it
was
4,700
acre-feet
a
year.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
at
the
diversion
point.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
right.
at
the
diversion
point.
then
there
is
an
accumulation
in
colorado
below
the
diversion
point.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
deny
that.
we
simply
point
out
that
with
these
conservation
measures
and
considering
that
colorado
would
be
taking
only
one-fourth
of
the
flow
in
the
vermejo
river,
another
factor
as
far
as
the
district
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question
but
what
these
other
diverters
are
going
to
get
their
water.
the
monthly
figures
at
the
dawson
gauge
show
that.
they
are
all
senior
to
the
district--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--well,
i
was
going
to
get
to
the
point,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
figures
that
the
special
master
set
forth
in
his
report
in
his
additional
findings
as
to
the
amount
of
water
coming
to
the
district
from
other
sources
were
about
45
percent.
the
district,
in
other
words,
gets
about
35
percent
of
its
water
from
the
chico
ricco
and
10
percent
from
creeks
which
flow
into
the
district's
system.
so
the
water
that
the
district
gets
from
the
vermejo
is
only
a
little
over
half
of
its
total
supply.
those
other
sources,
of
course,
would
not
be
affected
in
any
way
by
the
colorado
diversion,
but
i
wanted
to
suggest
this
again
that
the
diverters
on
the
vermejo
other
than
the
district
would
not
be
affected
even
in
a
low
flow
year
because
all
but
one
are
irrigators
and
the
monthly
figures
at
the
dawson
gauge
even
in
the
low
flow
years
show
that
there
is
sufficient
water
for
that
purpose.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
i
suggest
that
the
special
master
very
properly
recognized
that
as
being
cumulative
and
cumulative
in
a
way
of
minor
significance.
new
mexico's
exhibit
f-29
gave
a
thirty-year
picture
of
the
spills
at
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
headgate.
it
showed
that
in
only
two
years
in
a
thirty-year
period
were
there
significant
spills.
now,
the
new
evidence
that
new
mexico
proposed
to
the
special
master
covered
the
years
'81
and
'82,
and
that
evidence
according
to
their
offer
of
proof
would
have
shown
more
than
4,000
acre-feet
of
water
spilling
past
the
district
headgate
in
each
of
those
years.
that
is
particular
significant
because
that
is
more
than
the
colorado
entitlement.
they
got
the
evidence
in
in
effect
because
it
is
at
page
50
of
their
brief,
one
of
these
charts.
it
shows
that
on
only
one
day
in
1981
did
the
spills
exceed
the
capacity
of
the
district
canal,
600
cubic
feet
per
second.
now
mr.
moots
has
testified
that
the
district
will
start
to
spill
at
450
cubic
feet
per
second,
but
this
evidence
showed
that
the
spills
exceeded...
the
amount
of
water
there
exceeded
450
cubic
feet
per
second
on
only
one
day.
so
this
was
water
that
the
district
was
entitled
to
take
and
it
could
have
taken
presumably
if
its
diversion
system
had
been
efficient
according
to
its
own
testimony.
so
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
basic
reason
that
the
special
master
did
not
take
that,
the
basic
reason
being
that
it
was
simply
cumulative.
it
was
a
two
year
period--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--we
objected.
we
did
not
object
vehemently.
new
mexico
said
we
screamed
and
hollered,
but
we
did
not.
we
objected.
we
asked
leave
to
present
additional
testimony,
but
we
had
16
days
of
trial,
many
exhibits.
it
was
clearly
cumulative.
the
other
two
areas
that
they
wanted
to
go
into,
one
of
them
was
this
closed
stock
water
system,
and
they
put
that
in
their
brief
on
remand
to
the
special
master.
there
was
just
one
factor
there
and
that
was
that
the
closed
stock
water
system...
really,
domestic
water
system
was
completed.
there
was
no
denying
that.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
the
district
demand
i
suggest
is
revealed
particularly
by
the
amount
of
acreage
that
the
district
irrigated
as
shown
by
their
own
exhibit,
by
the
fact
that
they
chose
to
continue
with
this
wasting
2,000
acre-feet
a
year
on
this
stock
water
business
instead
of
using
that
for
irrigation
the
district
picture,
i
suggest,
justice
white,
is
a
relaxed
one.
they
chose...
as
shown,
as
i
mentioned,
by
exhibit
41
after
a
conference
when
the
state
officials
said
they
would
have
to
be
charged
with
waste
if
there
was
administration...
they
chose
apparently
not
to
have
administration.
it
was
a
relaxed
situation.
much
more
than
half
of
the
people
in
the
district...
the
farms
were
part-time
farmers,
absentee
owners.
this
is
discussed
in
detail
in
the
bureau
documents,
exhibit
36,
which
the
district
witness
testified
was
currently
the
situation.
i
think
this
is
what
the
special
master
concluded.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
no,
i
am
suggesting
that
that
was
the
picture.
i
am
suggesting,
though,
that
a
new
mexico
water
law
is
interpreted
by
the
jicarilla
case
and
another
case
that
is
cited
in
that
require
beneficial
and
reasonable
use
of
water.
the
special
master
contrasted
the
new
mexico
picture
with
the
colorado
administration.
i
suggest
that
this
brings
into
play
the
wyoming
v.
colorado
concept
and
the
concept
suggested
in
this
case
that
wasteful
uses
will
not
be
protected
and
that
each
state
has
a
duty
to
preserve
the
common
supply.
now
in
colorado
as
testified
to
by
its
state
engineer
there
is
daily
surveillance
in
the
arkansas
river
division,
division
ii,
where
this
falls,
the
purgatory
falls,
of
water
diversions
of
the
amount
of
acreage
irrigated.
the
colorado
statute
specifically
requires
the
state
officials
to
shut
down
water
if
it
is
not
being
put
to
beneficial
use,
if
it
is
being
wasted.
this
was
the
picture
that
the
special
master
had.
as
said
in,
i
believe,
wyoming
v.
colorado
or
nebraska
v.
wyoming,
it
is
not
what
a
state
should
do
for
the
other
state,
but--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
the
question
of
duty
and
so
forth,
yes,
justice
marshall,
was--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i
am
relating
it,
justice
marshall,
to
the
question
of
conservation
which
i
believe
is
up
here.
we
felt
that
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
regarding
protecting
wasteful
practices
were
particularly
relevant
to
this
question
of
conservation.
now
there
is
another
area
that
administration
would
have
protected
and
dealt
with
that
would
have
been
a
benefit
to
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
and
that
is
the
overuse
of
water
by
other
diverters.
there
was
no
administration
and
no
surveillance.
these
other
diverters
were
senior,
had
senior
priorities,
and
there
were
not
any
records...
the
special
master
noted
that...
because
of
the
absence
of
administration,
but
the
interesting
thing
was
that
when
one
measurement
was
made
as
shown
by
a
new
mexico
exhibit,
a-130,
the
seepage
run
on
the
vermejo
had
shown
the
phelps
dodge
lessee
irrigating
after
what
new
mexico's
own
exhibit
had
said
was
the
irrigation
season,
after
september
15th,
and
using
an
amount
of
water,
300
acre-feet,
which
would
have
been
equivalent
to
the
total
annual
entitlement
of
that
diverter.
so
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
could
have
been
dealt
with
and
would
have
been
dealt
with
by
proper
administration
certainly
in
colorado.
all
of
these
factors,
i
suggest,
are
ones
that
the
special
master
took
into
account.
he
noted
also,
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
in
closing,
the
great
benefits
to
colorado
and
the
purgatory,
the
fact
that
the
city
of
trinidad
needed
water...
the
city
of
trinidad
put
a
moratorium
on
water
taps...
the
fact
that
there
was
29,000
acres
of
land,
irrigable
land,
in
the
purgatory
valley,
19,000
in
the
district
and
10,000
above
the
district
that
needed
water.
the
water
was
needed
for
coal
washing
purposes,
for
industrial
development.
he
put
that
together
with
the
picture
of
water
administration.
one
of
the
questions
this
court
propounded
was,
would
there
be
conservation
in
colorado,
and
he
concluded
that
there
would
be
because
of
the
colorado
picture
on
water
administration.
so
the
benefits
to
colorado,
it
is
our
position,
of
course,
that
with
conservation
measures
dealing
with
the
overuse,
with
the
silting
in
the
district
canals
and
particularly
this
conservation
measure
that
has
been
completed
with
the
domestic
water
system
which
eliminates
the
2,000
acre-foot
waste,
it
is
our
contention
that
there
will
be
no
harm
to
new
mexico
resulting
from
the
colorado
diversion.
but
if
there
should
be,
the
special
master
eminently
concluded
that
any
such
harm
would
be
outweighed
by
these
benefits
to
colorado,
and
that,
we
feel,
justice
marshall,
fits
into
both
the
concepts
and,
as
i
say,
the
principles
that
were
announced
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court's
decision.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
no,
we
did
not.
we
did
not
consider
that
to
be
an
exception,
justice
stevens.
we
suggested...
we
felt
that
the
main
thrust
of
the
special
master's
original
reports
and
his
additional
findings
that
colorado
should
have
4,000
acre-feet
of
water
a
year,
and
his
report
did
not
specifically
limit
the
colorado
points
of
diversion
as
being
the
points
where
this
water
should
be
taken
out
of
above
those
points.
so
we
suggested
that
there
be
that
limitation
that
colorado
could
not
take
anything
below
the
points
of
diversion
specified
in
the
colorado
decree,
and
that
along
with
that
there
be
this
ten-year
running
average
which
is
used
in
nebraska
v.
wyoming,
for
example,
and
also
used
in
the
colorado
river
compact.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
justice
o'connor,
if
colorado
was
specifically
limited
to
the
points
of
diversion
in
the
colorado
decree
it
could.
you
are
absolutely
right.
if,
however,
colorado
is
free
to
take
water
any
place
in
colorado
then
it
would
be
a
corollary
to
the
protection
that
would
be
given
by
limiting
colorado
to
these
points
of
diversion.
