mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
colorado
has
met
the
burden
of
establishing
a
basis
in
fact
which
would
warrant
an
award
of
water
for
a
future
use
in
colorado
on
a
river
that
has
been
fully
appropriated
and
used
in
new
mexico.
the
master's
report
before
the
court
simply
adopts
colorado's
case.
colorado's
case,
however,
does
not
begin
to
meet
the
standard
of
preponderance
in
ordinary
civil
actions
much
less
the
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
original
actions
between
states.
the
master
has
recommended
an
award
of
4,000
acre-feet.
the
bottom
line
of
that
recommendation
is
his
conclusion
that
there
would
be
no
injury
in
new
mexico.
that
conclusion
depends
upon
three
interdependent
factual
predicates.
the
first
of
those
is
that
the
acreage
in
new
mexico
must
be
cut
in
half.
that
is,
the
acreage
that
new
mexico
users
are
ready,
willing
and
able
to
irrigate
must
be
cut
in
half.
as
part
of
that
predicate
the
canadian
river
users
of
vermejo
water
must
not
even
be
considered
by
the
court.
the
reduced
acreage
on
the
main
stem
of
the
vermejo
in
the
1970's
must
not
have
been
caused
by
water
shortage.
the
new
mexico
water
users
must
not
have
been
diligent,
and
the
court
will,
therefore,
protect
only
5,300
acres
in
new
mexico
instead
of
9,100
acres.
secondly,
and
additionally
there
must
be
in
new
mexico
reasonable
conservation
measures
which
would
effectively
manufacture
or
make
available
or
augment
the
supply
by
4,000
acre-feet
at
the
diversion
points
in
colorado.
thirdly,
and
again
additionally
the
future
use
of
the
benefits
that
would
derive
therefrom
must
be
reasonably
certain
and
comparatively
unquestionable.
all
three
of
these
factual
predicates
are
essential
to
the
master's
report.
if
one
of
those
predicates
fails,
colorado's
case
fails
and
the
master's
report
fails.
we
believe
the
case
fails
on
all
three
predicates.
the
bottom
line
i
believe
in
this
case
generally
is
that
there
simply
is
not
enough
water
in
the
vermejo
river
to
make
it
possible
to
make
an
award
to
colorado
for
a
future
use.
in
the
court's
first
decision
in
this
case
the
court
indicated
two
ways
in
which
it
might
be
possible
to
apportion
water:
first,
augmentation
of
supply
in
two
ways,
either
through
water
conservation
or
through
the
effective
forfeiture
of
water
rights
not
diligently
exercised;
secondly,
the
court
indicated
that
through
a
balancing
of
benefit
to
the
future
use
in
colorado
against
detriment
to
the
cessation
of
the
existing
uses
in
new
mexico
an
award
might
be
made
to
colorado.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
not
at
all,
and
i
think
the
court's
first
instruction
to
the
master
in
the
first
area
of
evidence
taking
suggests
the
answer
to
the
question,
justice
o'connor.
the
court
said
that
to
determine
the
existing
uses
you
must
look
at
present
levels
of
use,
and
balance
on
the
one
hand
shortage
of
water
against
the
possible
inference
on
the
other
hand
of
lack
of
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
water
users.
we
presented
the
evidence.
colorado
did
not
present
the
evidence
to
do
that.
new
mexico
did
present
the
evidence
to
do
it.
that
evidence
indicates
that
for
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
as
an
example...
i
presume
that
they
are
the
users
to
whom
you
are
referring.
in
there
after
the
district
was
rehabilitated
in
1955
there
was
a
ten-year
development
period.
that
did
not
end
until
1965.
in
an
ordinary
reclamation
project
you
would
not
expect
the
water
users
during
that
period
to
have
developed
their
water
rights.
they
are
given
that
period
of
time
within
which
to
do
it.
right
after
that
as
the
evidence
shows
the
water
supply
dropped
off
substantially.
the
way
in
which
you
instructed
the
master
to
provide
the
factual
information
to
the
court
is
the
same
way
a
water
right
entitlement
is
adjudicated
in
most
every
western
state.
they
will
look
at
historic
use,
an
adjudication
court
will,
and
balance
on
the
one
hand
times
of
shortage
so
that
nonuse
might
be
excused
and
on
the
other
hand
the
possible
lack
of
diligence.
here
you
can
make
no
inference
of
lack
of
diligence
out
of
the
contractual
development
period.
once
that
stopped,
once
that
was
over
there
is
a
drought
on
the
river.
consequently,
while
the
water
users
are
still
ready,
willing
and
able
to
use
the
water
supply,
the
water
supply
simply
is
not
there.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
early
in
the
fifties.
see,
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
was
rehabilitated.
that
was
finished
in
1955.
prior
to
then
there
was
a
much
larger
irrigation
project,
nearly
twice
as
many
acres.
it
was
all
torn
apart.
the
canals
were
rebuilt.
some
reservoirs
were
taken
out.
new
reservoirs
were
put
in.
new
lands
were
leveled
or
were
to
be
leveled.
the
whole
place
was
rearranged.
so
in
1955
there
began
a
ten-year
period
within
which
to
develop
up
to
the
potential
of
the
district.
actually
it
was
seven
years.
it
was
later
amended
and
became
ten.
at
the
end
of
that
development
period
is
when
the
drought
years
began.
the
problem
with
the
master's
assessment...
the
master
says
he
looks
at
the
flow
records
or
the
flow
charts.
what
he
does
is
look
at
table
2
in
his
second
report
to
you.
we
invite
the
court
to
look
at
table
2.
table.2
is
the
average
discharge
for
every
month
of
every
year
from
1916
until
now.
the
master
looks
at
that,
but
he
does
no
do
anything
else.
he
does
not
compare
those
figures
with
anything.
that
is
the
end
of
the
master's
analysis.
that
is
the
beginning
of
new
mexico's
analysis.
what
you
have
to
do
is
take
those
figures
and
do
a
water
accounting
down
the
river
below
the
dawson
gauge
where
he
gets
the
figures.
you
have
to
add
accretions,
subtract
depletions
and
carry
those
figures,
carry
that
water
supply
down
to
the
farmer's
land
in
order
to
find
out
how
much
water
is
available
on
the
land.
if,
for
example,
you
look
at
the
year
1950...
and
the
master
has
told
the
court
he
finds
no
time
of
material
deficiency
or
intermittent
supply
by
looking
at
those
figures...
but
look
at
1950
in
his
chart.
if
you
add
up
the
discharge
for
the
year
you
will
find
the
first
figure
in
new
mexico's
exhibit
f-29.
that
figure
is
4,800
acre-feet.
if
you
do
a
water
budget
and
take
that
down
the
river
to
the
land,
you
end
up
with
1,600
acre-feet.
the
master
says
that
is
sufficient.
he
is
explaining
to
the
court
that
that
is
sufficient
to
irrigate
7,380
acres.
we
believe
that
is
patently
incorrect.
if
you
were
to
do
it
for
the
year
1951
you
would
end
up
with
nothing
on
the
farms.
if
you
were
to
do
it
for
1956
you
would
end
up
with
nothing
on
the
farms.
then
there
were
some
good
years
following
1955.
the
problem
there,
though,
was
the
development
of
the
district.
once
the
district
development
period
was
over
you
get
back
into
drought
years,
and
if
you
follow
through
on
exhibit
f-29
and
do
this
water
budget
accounting,
which
colorado
never
provided
and
the
master
never
did,
you
will
find
out
that
the
river
is
very,
very
short
in
the
seventies.
the
evidence
in
that
regard
is
overwhelming.
it
is
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
in
the
record.
if
you
were
to
compare
the
monthly
usgs
flows
to
demand
from
1916
to
now,
that
supports
new
mexico.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
testified
in
this
case,
including
its
regional
director
and
its
area
engineer.
both
are
personally
familiar
with
the
operation
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
they
testified
to
the
shortages.
their
testimony
is
unimpeached.
indeed,
in
this
regard
it
was
not
even
cross
examined.
the
water
users,
all
of
them,
testified
to
this
shortage.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
it
does
not
follow
at
all.
mr.
porter
is
one
of
a
number
of
users,
justice
stevens,
who
uses...
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--but
he
utilizes--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--that
is
correct.
but
he
utilizes
their
works
in
order
to
take
water.
he
takes
his
water
out
of
their
works.
a
comparison
of
the
same
flow
records
at
the
dawson
gauge
that
i
just
mentioned
in
our
exhibit
number
f-29
will
reveal
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
mr.
porter
as
it
does
to
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
there
simply
is
a
shortage
that
averages
6,600
acre-feet
per
year
between
1955
and
1979.
that
figure
is
corroborated
by
colorado's
own
exhibits.
their
exhibit
numbers
37,
38,
43,
45--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--he
may
have
gotten
all
the
water
he
needed
during
that
period
of
time.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
the
question
perhaps
you
are
asking,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
or
not
he
should
have
called
priority
somehow.
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
call
priority
because--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--that
is
true.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
district
might
have
done
so,
but
if
the
district
were
to
call
its
priority
and
take
the
water
rights
of
somebody
junior
to
it,
you
end
up
with
the
same
net
shortage.
you
have
to
reduce
the
amount
that
would
have
gone
to
somebody
else,
and
then
that
amount
is
given
to
the
district.
in
terms
of
the
new
mexico
users
in
general,
the
same
figure,
6,600
acre-feet
short,
is
still
true.
there
is
much
more
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
regard.
three
new
mexico
engineers
testified
to
the
shortage.
the
fish
and
wild
life
service,
the
united
states
fish
and
wild
life
service,
testified
to
the
shortage.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
he
is
free
to
disbelieve
any
witness
he
wants
to,
but
it
is
awfully
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
there
was
any
issue
of
credibility
in
this
case.
there
was
none.
i
think
that
issue
is
now
trying
to
be
injected
in
this
case
in
order
to
pump
up
the
weight
that
is
to
be
given
to
the
master's
report,
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
distrust
the
testimony
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
i
find
it
difficult
to
distrust
the
unimpeachable
evidence
of
the
usgs.
i
find
it
difficult
to
distrust
the
testimony
of
all
of
these
people.
the
reason
the
master
did
what
he
did
was
because
he
never
looked
at
demand.
he
simply
stopped
on
the
supply
side.
he
looked
at
that
table
and
he
just
surmised,
well,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
enough
water
there
for
everybody.
had
he
compared
that
to
the
demand
he
could
not
have
thought
all
of
those
people
were
not
telling
the
truth
to
the
court.
similarly
when
congress
passed
legislation
just
a
few
years
ago
to
relieve
the
repayment
obligation
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
that
was
done
upon
a
congressional
finding
of
the
very
water
shortage
that
the
master
says
does
not
exist.
we
find
it
hard
also
to
believe
that
congress
was
duped.
the
second
area
or
second,
way
in
which
the
court
can
apportion
water
according
to
the
master
in
the
first
decision
is
through
conservation,
and
the
court
has
indicated
in
its
first
decision
that
there
also
the
burden
has
shifted
to
colorado
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
there
are
reasonable
conservation
measures
available
in
new
mexico
which
would
make
4,000
acre-feet
at
the
diversion
points
in
colorado.
we
submit
there
is
not
any
evidence
of
any
particular
conservation
measure
in
the
record,
nor
is
there
any
discussion
nor
any
evidence
put
on
by
colorado
of
the
economic
and
physical
feasibility
of
any
given
conservation
measure.
there
is
no
discussion
of
how
much
water
might
be
made
at
the
diversion
points
in
colorado
from
any
given
conservation
measure.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
he
bought
colorado's
position
that
all
basin
discharge
is
available
as
a
practical
matter
and
divertable
by
the
water
users.
that
is
half
of
his
mistake.
the
other
half
is
he
never
bothered
to
compare
that
gross
figure,
which
was
already
wrong
methodologically,
with
the
demand.
so
he
is
patently
wrong
in
two
ways.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
well,
what
he
did
to
determine
the
demand
on
the
river
in
effect
was
to
equate
the
short
supply...
that
is
what
you
see
in
his
table
2...
with
the
acreage
that
was
irrigated
with
that
supply.
now
that
kind
of
logic
or
that
kind
of
reasoning
precludes
a
determination
of
water
shortage.
to
know
water
shortage
you
have
to
know
the
difference
between
the
supply
and
the
full
demand.
he
refused
to
look
at
the
full
demand.
the
reason
he
did
that
was
because
colorado
knew
in
the
beginning
that
the
only
way
they
could
even
argue
that
there
would
be
no
injury
to
new
mexico
in
this
case
is
to
cut
the
water
users
in
half
to
begin
with
and
leave
all
of
that
injury
behind.
that
is
what
the
special
master's
report
recommends
to
this
court.
there
is
nearly
4,000
acres
that
is
just
pushed
aside
to
begin
with
because
the
master
never
bothered
to
look
or
compare
supply
and
demand.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
master,
justice
rehnquist,
did
not
point
to
one
way
in
which
administration
would
be
able
to
save
water
in
new
mexico,
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
that
again
was
part
of
the
design
of
colorado's
case
and
was
necessitated
by
the
fact
that
there
are
no
reasonable
conservation
measures
available.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
but
the
master
is
most
definitely
wrong
because
he
has
not
been
able
to
pinpoint
how
it
would
work.
he
has
not
told
us
how
administration
would
work,
nor
is
there
any
testimony
point
on
by
colorado
about
how
you
can
somehow
administer
this
river
and
get
more
water.
what
colorado
did
was
to
put
on
the
testimony
of
his
state
engineer
and
then
elicit
from
our
state
engineer
the
fact
that
there
is
presently
no
water
master
on
the
vermejo
as
a
whole
and
then
argumentatively
in
briefs
colorado
tried
to
explain
as
they
managed
to
persuade
the
master
that
some
kind
of
administration
would
make
it
possible
to
conserve
water.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
most
certainly.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
loosely
administered.
if
you
were
to
compare
along
any
one
of
the
lines
that
colorado
has
suggested,
if
you
compare
administration
in
the
two
states,
new
mexico
does
not
come
out
on
the
short
end
of
the
stick.
for
instance,
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
there
is
a
manager
there.
there
are
two
ditch
riders
there.
all
of
the
uses
and
all
of
the
releases
are
metered
and
measured.
when
water
is
taken
out
of
the
reservoirs
everybody
knows
how
much
water
is
taken
out
of
the
reservoir.
that
is
all
of
the
farms
in
the
district.
that
is
as
much
administration
as
you
find
anywhere
in
colorado.
colorado
has
tried
to
suggest
that
water
could
be
made
available
if
the
state
engineer
came
in
and
administered
for
forfeiture.
our
point
is
colorado
put
on
no
evidence,
and
the
master
can
point
to
none,
indicating
any
land
on
the
entire
canadian
system
that
is
conducive
to
forfeiture.
there
is
none.
there
are
no
rights
that
are
conducive
to
forfeiture.
also,
if
you
were
to
compare
the
two
laws
in
that
regard,
colorado
urges
that
theirs
is
much
superior,
that
there
is
a
list
of
some
34
rights
on
the
purgatory
that
has
been
prepared
to
forfeit.
well,
if
you
look
and
see
what
happened
factually
and
historically
that
list
has
not
even
gone
to
adjudication.
in
new
mexico
nearly
8,000
acres
of
water
right
has
been
judicially
forfeited
on
the
vermejo
system.
if
you
compare
the
reality
of
the
two
there
is
no
discrepancy,
then
there
is
not
this
looseness
in
administration.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
retain
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
justice
marshall,
i
believe
because,
number
one,
the
master
never
compared
supply
and
demand
thus
because
his
finding
with
respect
to
lack
of
diligence
on
the
part
of
new
mexico
users
flies
in
the
face
of
all
of
the
testimony,
because
he
is
patently
wrong
it
could
be
dismissed
on
that
basis.
it
could
be
dismissed
because
colorado
did
not
meet
its
burden
on
putting
on
any
evidence
with
respect
to
an
economically
and
physically
feasible
conservation
measure.
both
of
those
problems
exist
in
the
master's
report.
it
could
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
having
met
the
burden
of
proof
on
either
of
them.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
there
is
an
extremely
important
point
with
regard
to
this
2,000
acre-feet
that
colorado
has
talked
about
a
great
deal
being
conserved
from
the
closed
pipeline
that
was
put
in
by
new
mexico
users,
two
very
critical
points.
first
of
all,
colorado
says
that
there
is
an
exhibit
e-3.
that
exhibit
has
in
it
a
figure
of
2,000
acre-feet
that
could
be
saved
if
a
closed
stock
water
pipeline
were
put
in.
if
you
translate
that
2,000
acre-feet
in
the
reservoirs
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
into
4,000
acre-feet
through
all
of
the
efficiency
coefficients
in
route
to
4,000
acre-feet
at
the
diversion
points
in
colorado.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
2,000
figure
is
2,145.
it
was
estimated
in
that
exhibit
by
taking
the
month
of
november,
finding
out
how
much
water
was
released
then
after
the
irrigation
season
was
over
and
when
all
of
the
canals
were
dry
and
multiplying
it
by
nine.
you
get
a
very
inflated
figure
designed
to
support
this
project.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
and
according
to
the
unimpeached
testimony
of
colorado
if
you
look
at
their
table
4
of
their
exhibit
number
6
the
average
amount
of
water
released
during
the
period
of
the
life
of
the
district
has
been
790
acre-feet,
not
2,000
acre-feet.
that
is
colorado's
testimony.
that
is
based
on
colorado's
discussion
with
the
people
that
manage
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
special
master
never
looked
at
that
exhibit.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
he
did
not.
he
made
no
specific
finding
in
that
regard.
colorado
is
arguing
that
this
one
measure,
and
it
is
the
only
one
they
can
point
to,
is
going
to
offset
the
new
diversion
in
colorado.
to
do
that
he
has
to
be
correct.
colorado
has
to
be
correct
that
it
is
going
to
make
4,000
acre-feet
in
colorado.
it
will
not.
seven
hundred
ninety
acre-feet
diversion
on
the
average.
bear
in
mind
this
was
because
that
is
what
the
bureau
of
reclamation
gave
them
to
use.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
1,500
acre-feet.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
we
would
we
agree
with...
no,
we
don't
agree
with
that
methodology,
but
utilizing
colorado's
methodology
in
backing
up
the
river
you
would
have
an
offset
only
of
1,500
acre-feet.
what
that
nets
out
to
be
is
cutting
into
the
new
mexico
uses,
not
only
the
ones
we
already
threw
out,
half
of
the
entitlement.
now
you
cut
into
the
ones
that
are
left
by
an
additional
2,500
acre-feet.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
justice
stevens,
i
do
not
think
i
can
answer
that
without
the
help
of
an
engineer.
the
reason
is--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--no.
the
figure
would
be
about
the
same.
we
agree
with
the
790
figure.
the
only
difference
is
how
you
translate
that
790
at
the
reservoir--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--no.
it
is
the
equivalent
of
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
1,500
acre-feet.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
we
do
not
exactly
agree
with
it.
there
is
no
dispute
over
it
insofar
as
this
point
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
secondly,
the
conservation
measure
that
is
being
discussed
was
undertaken
long
before
this
litigation
began.
it
was
undertaken
because
the
water
users
themselves
recognized
that
what
the
bureau
of
reclamation
gave
them
to
work
with
was
not
very
good,
and
they
worked
awfully
hard
to
put
together
the
money.
they
went
to
every
state
and
federal
agency
you
can
conceive
of
to
get
that
money.
they
finally
put
the
package
together
and
built
the
system.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is
not
whether
cf&i
should
vicariously
be
awarded
the
benefits
of
their
labors,
but
rather
whether
this
court
is
going
to
protect
the
kind
of
conservation
measure,
ongoing
conservation
measure,
that
it
has
said
the
states
on
an
interstate
stream
are
obliged
to
do.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no.
what
the
evidence
shows
without
contradiction,
and
it
is
the
evidence
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
it
is
the
evidence
of
the
usgs.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
is
no
economically
or
physically
feasible
conservation
measure,
any
further
ones,
available
in
new
mexico.
we
have
the
ultimate
conservation
measure
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
canadian
system.
there
are
two
major
reservoirs
down
there
that
impound
nearly
500,000
acre-feet
of
water.
the
vermejo
dumps
into
that.
colorado
would
have
you
believe
that
the
river
channel
that
runs
from
the
point
of
diversion
at
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
down
into
conscious
reservoir
does
not
exist.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
those
uses
have
to
be
thrown
out
entirely
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
of
no
injury.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
justice
white,
they
along
with
the
4,000
acres
that
you
would
throw
out
along
with
the
additional
undercutting
of
new
mexico
uses
by
2,500
acre
feet
plus
the
13
percent
shortage
of
the
canadian
river
users
and
their
historic
reliance
on
the
vermejo,
yes,
they
all
add
up.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is
completely
adjudicated,
but
there
are
spills
and
they
get
down
there
frequently
as
the
usgs
data
show.
if
you
look
at
the
entire
period
of
record
and
not
the
mean
daily
flows
on
the
exhibit
to
which
mr.
welborn
has
referred
you
to,
you
will
find
an
average
flowing
past
that
diversion
point
of
7,700
acre-feet
over
the
long
haul.
that
is
a
lot
of
water
getting
down
to
the
canadian
river.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
yes.
that
is
essentially
flood
flow.
one
final
point,
even
if
the
court
were
to
buy
everything
that
the
master
did,
which
we
believe
is
patently
incorrect
because
he
never
compared
demand
to
supply
and
because
he
never
identified
a
conservation
measure,
he
has
not
shown
you
one
reason
either
in
law
or
in
equity
why
priority
should
be
varied
even
if
colorado
were
to
be
awarded
the
water.
thank
you.
