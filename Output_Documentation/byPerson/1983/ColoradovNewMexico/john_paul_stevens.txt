mr.
simms,
can
i
ask
a
question
about
one
of
the
master's
findings.
he
refers
to
a
man
named
porter
on
page
7,
who
is
an
individual
user,
as
i
understand,
downstream
of
the
district.
he
got
substantially
all
his
water
as
i
understand
what
the
master
found
and
did
not
complain
that
the...
he
got
85
percent
i
think.
the
difference
he
did
not
get
was
attributable
to
the
shortage.
if
he
could
get
anything
at
all,
does
it
not
follow
inexorably
that
the
district
itself
must
have
gotten
all
it
needed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
is
downstream.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
junior
to
them,
is
he
not?
his
rights
are
junior
to
theirs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
cut
through
because
i
do
not
have
the
facts
nearly
as
well
in
mind
as
you
do.
is
it
correct
that
he
got
all
the
water
he
needed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
his
rights
are
junior
to
the
district's
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
got
all
the
water
he
needed
could
someone
who
had
senior
rights
to
his
have
preempted
his
water?
justice
john
paul
stevens
including
the
district
could
have
done
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
welborn?
at
the
end
of
your
brief
you
suggested
maybe
the
decree
should
be
rewritten
in
a
couple
of
minor
respects,
or
maybe
they
are
not
so
minor.
did
you
take
any
exceptions
to
the
master's
report
yourself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
say
that
the
2,000
figure
should
really
be
790.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
view
of
the
correct
ratio
if
you
do
not
accept
their
two-for-one
figure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
somewhat
larger
than
790
though?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
take
the
position
that
790
feet
saved
down
in
the
reservoir
is
the
equivalent
of
790
feet
diverted
up
in
colorado?
