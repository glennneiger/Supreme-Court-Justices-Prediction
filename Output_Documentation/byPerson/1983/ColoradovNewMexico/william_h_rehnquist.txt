justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
simms,
how
valid
are
these
points
now?
i
can
see
arguing
to
the
master
that
this
testimony
supports
such
and
such
a
finding,
but
the
master
has
rejected
a
lot
of
testimony
by
his
findings.
we
do
not
review
that
de
novo
to
decide.
he
is
free
to
disbelieve
any
witness
he
wants
to
as
i
understand.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
master
has
found
that
new
mexico's
administration
of
its
water
decrease
was
much
looser
than
colorado's.
certainly
the
intimation
from
those
findings
is
that
new
mexico
could
do
a
much
better
job
of
conserving
and
make
better
use
of
the
water
that
it
gets.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
it
is
part
of
colorado's
case
does
not
mean
it
is
wrong.
everybody
starts
with
a
case
they
try
to
get
the
finder
of
fact
to
adopt,
and
he
is
going
to
go
presumably
for
one
or
the
other.
so
the
fact
that
he
has,
as
you
say,
bought
some
of
your
opponent's
ideas
does
not
make
them
wrong
for
that
reason.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
since
the
master's
finding
does
not
meaning
anything
he
should
not
only
find
that
the
new
mexico
decree
is
loosely
administered
but
be
able
to
point
out
how
tighter
administration
would
somehow
save
water.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
welborn,
let's
assume
that
the
master
was
justified
in
finding
that
colorado
was
entitled
to
some
allocation
out
of
the
vermejo.
now
as
i
understand
the
decree
it
basically
gives
colorado
4,000
acre-feet.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
is
that
going
to
work,
say,
if
another
year
like
1974
comes
along
which
table
2
to
the
master's
report
shows
that
the
annual
flow
at
the
dawson
checkpoint
was
3,040?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
dawson
checkpoint
made
up
largely
of
water
that
you
would
call
the
colorado
production?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
year
where
the
dawson
gauge
says
3,040?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
then
that
you
think
the
records
supports
the
finding
that
new
mexico's
demand
could
be
satisfied
with
3,000
acre-feet?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
welborn,
you
say
you
are
only
taking
one-fourth
of
the
flow
in
the
colorado
river.
that
is
fine...
in
the
vermejo.
that
is
fine
in
a
year
when
they
get
16,000.
but
'74
was
a
year
when
they
did
not
even
get
4,000.
