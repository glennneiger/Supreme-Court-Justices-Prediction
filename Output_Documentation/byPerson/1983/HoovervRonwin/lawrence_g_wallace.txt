mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
whether
the
complaint
in
this
case
should
have
survived
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
the
procedurally
narrow
question
before
the
court,
but
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
a
somewhat
broader
perspective
than
the
immediately
presented
context
of
bar
examinations
helps
to
illuminate
the
proper
resolution
of
that
question.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
states
to
have
dozens
of
boards
or
commissions
with
authority
to
license
or
to
regulate
particular
trades
or
professions,
and
these
boards
are
often
comprised,
as
in
this
case,
exclusively
or
predominantly
of
individuals
who
are
themselves
engaged
in
the
trade
being
regulated.
some
of
these
boards
pose
dangers
of
the
imposition
of
guild
type
restrictions
on
competition
that
quite
frankly
are
of
considerably
more
significance
to
our
competitive
economy
than
the
question
whether
an
artificially
reduced
additional
number
of
lawyers
was
admitted
to
practice
after
a
particular
bar
examination.
in
recent
years,
the
enforcement
activities
of
the
united
states
in
this
area
have
focused
primarily
on
rules
adopted
by
these
boards
prohibiting
competitive
bidding,
or
prohibiting
advertising,
or
otherwise
restricting
methods
of
solicitation
of
business.
one
of
these
enforcement
actions
of
the
federal
government
has
resulted
in
a
reported
case.
it
was
an
action
that
we
brought
against
the
texas
state
board
of
public
accountancy
which
had
adopted
a
rule
that
a
public
accountant
shall
not
make
a
competitive
bid
for
professional
services.
that
rules
was
restrained
by
the
district
court.
the
decision
was
upheld
by
the
fifth
circuit,
reported
at
592
f.
2nd
919,
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
444
u.s.
925.
we
have
brought
a
similar
action
against
the
mississippi
state
board
of
registration
for
professional
engineers
and
land
surveyors
in
which
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
are
being
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
decision
in
this
case.
we
also
filed
a
civil
antitrust
suit
against
the
alaska
board
of
registration
for
architects,
engineers,
and
land
surveyors,
which
also
had
adopted
a
competitive
bidding
ban.
we
have
negotiated
a
consent
decree
in
that
case
which
will
require
elimination
of
that
ban.
we
have
filed
in
april
of
last
year
a
civil
antitrust
suit
against
the
state
board
of
certified
public
accountants
of
louisiana
which
had
adopted
a
rule
restricting
advertising
and
solicitation,
and
that
case
is
scheduled
to
go
to
trial
later
this
month.
the
cases
that
have
actually
been
filed
represent
only
a
part
of
the
enforcement
activities
we
have
engaged
in
in
this
area.
many
times,
our
investigations
have
led
to
the
rescission
of
rules
of
this
kind.
for
example,
in
1982,
the
west
virginia
board
of
accountancy
rescinded
bans
on
competitive
bidding
and
solicitation
when
it
became
apparent
that
we
would
file
suit
if
they
did
not
do
so.
now,
all
of
the
rules
that
i
have
just
referred
to
were
adopted
pursuant
to
general
enabling
statutes
which
authorized
these
boards
to
adopt
rules
to
further
professional
ethics,
and
otherwise
gave
neutrally
phrased
authority
to
the
boards.
but
there
is
also
a
danger
that
more
specific
statutory
authority
to
deny
licenses
or
to
prohibit
practices
for
statutorily
specified
purposes
can
be
distorted
into
anti-competitive
uses.
we
gave
one
hypothetical
example
in
our
brief
of
a
board
to
determine
whether
restaurants
meet
health
and
sanitation
requirements,
and
the
possibility
that
it
might
for
anti-competitive
reasons
refuse
to
license
a
restaurant
even
though
it
had
no
basis
for
thinking
that
there
was
any
health
or
sanitation
problem.
another
example
might
be
hypothesized
from
the
face
of
the
maryland
statutes
dealing
with
savings
and
loan
regulation.
the
state
of
maryland
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
taking
a
position
similar
to
ours.
one
of
the
things
provided
in
their
statute
is
that
a
board
of
savings
and
loan
association
commissioners,
consisting
of
a
majority
of
members
engaged
in
the
business,
will
monitor,
and
approve
or
disapprove
certain
kinds
of
new
practices
proposed
by
institutions
practicing
in
that
field
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
innovation
proposed
might
undermine
the
financial
stability
of
the
particular
savings
and
loan.
one
could
see
the
temptation
that
there
might
be
in
a
board
of
that
sort
to
reject
a
competitive
innovation
by
a
competitor
in
the
field
even
though
there
was
no
basis
for
thinking
that
that
innovation
would
in
any
way
undermine
the
financial
stability
of
that
competitor.
these
hypothetical
possibilities
and
the
real
cases
that
we
have
brought
are
a
bit
reminiscent
of
one
of
this
court's
classic
antitrust
decisions
that
in
the
fashion
originators
guild
case.
the
difference
is
that
unlike
the
situation
in
fashion
originators
guild
there
is
no
need
to
aggregate
the
market
power
and
to
exercise
that
power,
if
power
conferred
by
the
state
on
a
group
of
people
in
the
business
can
be
distorted
into
anti-competitive
uses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
if
there
could
be
a
showing
that
there
was
no
reasonable
objective
basis
on
which
the
restrictions
that
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
but
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
which
we
have
to
assume
is
true.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
not
inconceivable.
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
the
remedies
must
be
restricted
to
remedies
under
state
procedures
and
in
the
state
courts,
but
that
argument
seems
to
me
foreclosed
by
the
court's
decision
in
the
city
of
boulder
which
upheld
an
antitrust
complaint
for
an
injunction
where
the
charge
was
that
restraint
of
trade
was
undertaken
by
public
officials
and
was
not
pursuant
to
a
policy
adopted
by
the
state
sovereign.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
rather
doubt
it.
i
haven't
focused,
and
i
certainly
have
not
discussed
with
my
colleagues
this
particular
issue,
but
that
would
not
foreclose
persons
from
going
to
law
school
that
did
not
have
such
high
academic
standards.
it
might
actually
provide
that
individual
with
a
better
opportunity
for
a
legal
education
at
a
pace
that
would
be
more
suitable
for
his
talents.
it
would
not
foreclose
the
possibility
of
his
entering
into
the
practice
of
law.
so
long
that
there
were
no
deception
involved,
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
credible
case
that
there
was
an
antitrust
restraint.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
don't
have
to
have
graduated
from
that
particular
law
school.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
not
the
same
opportunity
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
not
the
same
opportunity
to
restrain
competition
that
is
involved
here.
that
is
our
point
in
viewing
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
in
perspective.
the
mere
fact
that
this
is
a
board
of
public
officials
does
not
mean
that
all
of
their
activities
ipso
facto
are
immune
from
antitrust
regulation.
that
seems
to
us
to
follow
a
fortiori
from
the
decision
in
the
city
of
boulder
because
if
that
was
true
of
elected
officials
responsible
for
the
general
welfare
of
the
community
alleged
to
be
acting
in
conformity
with
the
state
statute,
it
has
to
be
true
for
these
part-time
public
officials
alleged
to
be
acting
contrary
to
the
mandate
given
the
by
a
state
statute.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
below
distinguished
the
city
of
boulder
case
on
the
ground
that
city
officials
could
be
more
parochial.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
antitrust
concerns
there
is
a
greater
parochialism
in
a
group
of
public
officials
composed
of
individuals
with
a
common
economic
interest
than
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
geographically
restricted
point
of
view
about
the
general
public
welfare.
there
is
a
clearly
stated
state
policy
that
the
board
here
claims
to
be
following
and
that
is
to
administer
a
bar
examination
that
measures
for
competence
and
to
report
to
the
state
supreme
court
who
demonstrated
competence
on
that
examination
and
who
did
not.
and,
if
objectively
looked
at,
what
the
board
did
in
any
way
reasonably
furthers
that
policy,
then
they
have
performed
within
the
immunity
in
our
view.
we
do
not
regard
it
as
a
proper
inquiry
for
the
courts
to
determine
what
their
motivations
were,
so
long
as
their
actions
objectively
fell
within
that
grant
of
authority
that
is
a
restraint
that
had
to
be
contemplated
and
authorized
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
conferring
discretion
on
the
board
to
act
anywhere
within
that
range
of
authority.
but
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
here
is
that
they
imposed
an
artificial
limit
on
the
number
who
could
pass
the
exam
in
a
manner
unrelated
to
competence.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
an
allegation
that
they
went
beyond
the
specifically
articulated
state
policy,
and
an
allegation
that
has
to
withstand
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
even
though
it
is
quite
possible
that
a
case
like
this
can
be
resolved
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
without
an
extensive
trial.
the
fact
that
the
report
that
they
make
to
the
state
supreme
court
is
in
the
form
of
a
recommendation,
seems
to
us
to
be
a
formal
distinction
from
other
licensing
boards
that
really
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
of
the
imposition,
through
distorting
the
state
given
authority,
the
imposition
of
a
trade
restraint
of
some
significance
to
antitrust
policy,
if
they
know
that
the
report
that
they
have
been
asked
to
give
will
generally
be
followed,
and
that
report
seems
to
be
a
report
on
who
demonstrated
competence
and
who
did
not,
but
has
actually
been
used
for
other
purposes,
and
that
is
what
the
complaint
alleges.
