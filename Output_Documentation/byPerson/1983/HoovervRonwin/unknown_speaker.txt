unknown
speaker
suppose
that
on
his
very
first
go-round,
when
he
went
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
he
did
present
his
antitrust
claim
and
said,
i
should
have
a
license.
unknown
speaker
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
turned
him
down.
what
if,
in
petitioning
here,
he
had
said,
the
arizona
supreme
court
didn't
understand
the
antitrust
point,
so
they
made
a
mistake.
they
made
a
mistake
on
the
antitrust
laws.
they
assumed
that
it
wasn't
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
obviously,
and
they
were
wrong.
suppose
we
had
granted
that
petition
for
certiorari
on
a
claim
like
that,
what
would
your...
your
argument
then
here
would
be
not
procedure,
but
it
would
be
that
this
is
state
action.
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
be
saying
that
it
is
not...
that
your
action
is
state
action.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
what
would
your
argument
be?
unknown
speaker
what
would
your
argument
be?
unknown
speaker
you
would
also
say,
though,
that
the
antitrust
laws
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
because
we
were
acting
as
an
agency
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
actually,
since
the
arizona
supreme
court
would
have
been
turning
him
down,
that
is
state
action,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hoover,
do
the
bar
examiner
screen
on
the
basis
of
anything
except
legal
competence?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
show
that,
mr.
hoover?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
interview
like
some
states
do
for
ethics
or
moral
qualifications?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
an
automatic
interview?
unknown
speaker
but
of
course--
--excuse
me,
go
ahead.
if...
i
gather
legal
competence
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
a
written
examination,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
applicant
passes
that,
he
may
nevertheless
be
denied
admission
on
one
of
these
other
factors?
unknown
speaker
age
is
simple,
of
course,
he
is
or
isn't
over
21,
but
what
about
the
mental
one?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
as
justice
stevens
asked
you,
though,
we
assume
that
he
has
been
denied
because...
it
is
a
pleading
stage
because
he
wasn't
admitted
when
he
took
bar
because
you
had
a
quota.
unknown
speaker
it
is
as
though
he
had
been
denied
admission
because
you
only
wanted,
let's
just
take,
for
instance,
100
lawyers
instead
of
200
lawyers
being
admitted
each
year,
and
he
happened
to
be
the
101st
on
the
list.
that
is
the
way
we
judge
this
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
professor
embrace
the
boulder
television
case?
unknown
speaker
before.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
it
be
passivity
if
the
legislature
or
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
gives
you
authority
to
do
anything
you
want
to
or
very
broad
discretion
in
giving
exams
and
in
recommending
admission?
unknown
speaker
you
could
go
any
way
of
several
ways.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
you've
already
answered
this,
mr.
hoover.
i
gather
that
x
number
by
the
results
of
the
examination
demonstrate
minimum
competency.
there
is
no
practice
of
saying,
well,
only
half
of
those
or
only
three
quarters
of
those
will
be
admitted.
unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
could
expressly
do
it.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
say
that
you
should
have
won
this
summary
judgment
motion.
unknown
speaker
a
motion
for
dismissal,
why
should
you
win
that,
because
it
says
that
he
was
excluded
not
because
he
didn't
have
the
qualifications
or
the
requirements,
but
just
because
he
was
the
101st
on
the
list,
that's
in
his,
because
to
restrict
the
numbers.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
must...
how
can
you
say
that
you
are
living
up
to
that
policy,
if
you
concede
that
he
was
excluded
because
he
would
have
made
too
many
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
then
you
don't...
you
really
can't
be
contending
that
it
is
state
policy
to
do
that,
then.
unknown
speaker
to
get
in
the
state
action
exception,
you
have
say,
this
is
our
state
policy
to
restrain
competition.
you
just
said
to
me,
well,
nobody
would
ever
restrain
competition
this
way.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
a
perfect
defense
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
faith
in
our
federal
judicial
system.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
deviated
from
the
state
policy...
suppose
you
did
deliberately
deviate
from
state
policy
as
it
seems
to
have
been
alleged
in
the
complaint.
i
don't
know
about
antitrust
liability,
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
you
should
be
deviating
from
state
policy?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
mr.
ronwin,
it's
your
allegation
that
the
bar
examiners
purposely
restricted
the
number
of
lawyers
allowed?
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking,
are
you
alleging
that?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
that
they
did...
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
did
you
say
you
are
not
alleging
that
they
purposely
did
this
to
restrict
the
number
of
those
admitted?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
do
allege
that
in
advance
they
had
some
idea
about
how
many
they
wanted
to
admit.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
the
number...
are
you
alleging
that
the
number
who
came
out
with
the
70
was
just
coincidentally
the
number
that
they
decided
that
year
to
admit?
unknown
speaker
they
must
have
been
doing
it
knowingly,
then.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
win
your
case
without
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ronwin,
are
you
admitted
anywhere
to
practice?
unknown
speaker
in
iowa.
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
to
move
to
arizona,
or
you
have
moved
to
arizona?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
state
law
school.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
tell
him
before?
unknown
speaker
why
has
he
passed
now
and
he
didn't
pass
before?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
