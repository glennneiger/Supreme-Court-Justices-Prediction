i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
hoover.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
depart
from
the
pleading
situation,
on
another
hypothetical,
i
assume
that
a
person
could
take
the
examination,
get
a
mark
of
99,
and
then
in
the
later
stages
it
would
develop
that
he
had
just
recently
been
convicted
of
stock
fraud
in
violation
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
and
you
might
then
reject
him...
reject
the
admission
on
that
ground,
even
if
he
had
99
on
the
examination.
chief
justice

but
that
is
not
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
to
apply
that
proposition
even
it
developed
later
that
the
person
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
was
not
21
years
of
age.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you've
got
to
meet
all
of
the
qualifications,
would
you
not?
