rule
28(a)
of
your
bar,
quoted
on
page
7
of
your
brief,
provides
that
the
committee
shall
examine
applicants,
shall
recommend
to
this
court
for
admission
to
practice
applicants
who
are
found
by
the
committee
to
have
the
necessary
qualifications,
and
would
only,
if
not
there--
justice

--do
you
see
the
rule
i
am
reading
from,
it
is
rule
28(a).
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
starts
on
page
6
of
your
blue
brief.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
look
over
on
page
7,
the
fourth
line
down,
"the
committee
shall
examine
applicants
and
recommend
to
this
court
for
admission
to
practice
applicants
who
are
found
by
the
committee
to
have
the
necessary
qualifications.
"
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
construe
that
to
mean
all
applicants
who
have
the
necessary
qualifications
as
determined
by
your
committee?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
the
policy
of
the
state
of
arizona?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
wallace,
could
i
put
a
hypothetical
to
you,
i'm
sure
you
have
thought
about
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
common
knowledge,
of
course,
that
law
schools
establish
scores
below
which
one
does
not
pass.
are
you
arguing
that
a
state
law
school
that
does
that
arguably
would
be
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that
hasn't
been
shown
in
this
case,
has
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
every
law
school
would
be
subjected
to
suit
if
a
complaint
like
this
were
filed
against
it...
every
state
law
school?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
be
inappropriate
for
a
state
law
school
to
decided,
as
i
think
some
have,
that
it
wishes
to
have
a
higher
quality
of
students
and
require
a
higher
grade
of
performance
before
it
gives
the
accolade
of
a
degree?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
many
states,
i
think,
still
admit
people
to
practice
who
may
not
have
graduated
from
a
law
school,
but
other
states
do
not,
and
law
firms,
certainly
the
law
firms
i
am
familiar
with
are
not
going
to
hire
someone
who
failed
to
graduate
from
an
accredited
law
school.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
true.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
to
find
one
that
has
a
low
standard
of
quality.
