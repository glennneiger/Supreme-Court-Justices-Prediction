mr.
charles
r.
hoover
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
keep
in
mind
exactly
what
this
case
is
about,
because
many
items
in
the
brief
deal
with
issues
that
are
not
really
here.
i
think
judge
ferguson,
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
dissent,
very
distinctly
put
it
in
the
beginning
of
that,
that
this
is,
in
effect,
a
case
dealing
with
the
subject
of
a
male
person
who
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
mentally
unable
to
engage
in
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
arizona,
may
still
maintain
a
$2,200,000
damage
action
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws
against
the
committee
on
examination
and
admission
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
for
failing
to
give
him
a
passing
grade
on
the
state
bar
examination.
looking
at
what
the
case
is
about,
we
are
here
contending
that
on
at
least
four
principal
bases
we
should
prevail,
that
is
the
committee
members
should
not
be
subject
to
this
kind
of
action.
three
of
those
are
state
action
items.
the
first
is
that
we
contend
that
we
are
involved
in
state
action
as
the
state,
as
the
sovereign.
secondly,
failing
that
particular
test
in
your
view,
that
we
are
involved
in
state
action
as
a
subdivision
of
the
state.
thirdly,
failing
that,
that
we
would
be
involved
in
state
actions
as
a
private
party,
although
we
do
concur
with
the
amicus
position
of
the
united
states
that
that
is
not
the
case
here,
we
are
not
private
parties,
although
we
certainly
that
they
meet
those
tests...
that
we
meet
those
tests.
fourthly,
that
if
there
is
no
state
action
involved
at
all,
then
the
noerr-pennington
doctrine
would
apply
insofar
as
antitrust
matters
are
concerned.
the
principal
basis
of
the
state
action
doctrine,
as
an
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
is
federalism.
i
think
something
again
ought
to
be
kept
in
mind
that
taking
the
case
as
it
is,
as
a
pleadings
case,
and
assuming
that
the
members
of
the
committee
did
all
of
the
wrongful
things
that
either
the
complaint
alleges
or
that
the
briefs
infer,
the
federal
antitrust
laws
are
not
the
basis
upon
which
to
redress
this
matter.
there
are
plenty
of
remedies
available
to
mr.
ronwin,
to
anyone
in
mr.
ronwin's
position,
to
in
effect
have
his
day
in
court,
to
have
his
merits
as
a
lawyer
determined,
to
have
his
claim
in
effect
adjudicated.
in
fact,
we
contend
he
has
done
just
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
admissions,
on
the
very
issues
that
we
are
talking
about,
have
previously
been
determined
by
the
state
of
arizona.
in
other
words,
these
facts
were
presented
to
them,
and
they
have
been
brought
to
this
court,
not
once,
but
he
has
gone
to
the
state
of
arizona
on
three
different
occasions
and
been
turned
down,
and
to
this
court,
from
those
three
different
occasions,
on
four
different
writs
of
certiorari
in
addition
to
this
case.
so
it
is
not
a
situation
where
we
are
dealing
with
any
man's
rights
that
have
not
had
a
fair
chance
to
be
adjudicated.
this
is
a
case
where
we
are
dealing
with
what
very
chilling
effect
on
state
or
state
officers,
state
officials,
you
have
by
subjecting
them
to
the
pressures
and
the
difficulties
of
facing
a
trial
on
merits
and
facts
for
some
underlying
purposes
or
reasons
under
the
antitrust
laws.
our
view
basically
is
that
under
parker
versus
brown,
which
to
us
is
the
heart
of
the
case,
in
fact
that
this
is
very
much
the
heart
of
the
case--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--first,
your
honor,
we
very
much
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
recognize
we
deny
having
done
that.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
we
must
assume
it's
true
for
this
case
because
it
is
a
pleadings
case.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
how
does
he
do
that;
exactly
the
way
he
did
it,
and
exactly
the
way
that
a
case,
the
met-coal
case,
challenged
a
state
statute
in
california,
that
is
through
some
other
proceeding
in
the
state
courts
saying,
look,
the
state
should
give
me
a
license
to
practice,
and
if
the
method
by
which
i
am
trying
to
get
there
is
improper
because
of
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
then
i
ought
to
get
my
license.
that
is
exactly
an
issue
that
he
presented
in
may
of
1974
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
they
denied
it,
and
he
brought
the
case
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
in
doing
so,
he
took
the
very
same
basis...
the
very
same
basis
that
he
contended
was
the
basis
of
the
antitrust
claim.
although
he
did
not
present
the
antitrust
claim
to
this
court
in
august
of
1974,
he
brought
these
same
grounds
here
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
he
said--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--that
is
an
alternate
ground,
your
honor,
that
has
been
suggested
for
the
first
time
in
these
proceedings
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
united
states
as
a
basis
that
the
case
could
be
disposed
on
if
it
were
returned
to
the
court
below.
i
am
answering
your
question--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--just
to
give
you
an
example
of
how
he
could
do
it,
and
in
fact
he
did.
and,
yes,
ultimately,
res
judicata
could
dispose
of
this
case,
but
here
is
the
method
by
which
somebody
should
raise
these
issues
in
a
system
of
federalism.
he
said
that
the
lack
of
a
preset
standard
and
failure
to
grade
petitioner
on
his
own
legal
abilities,
unrelated
to
those
of
the
particular
group
taking
the
exam
at
the
same
time
as
petitioner,
constituted
a
denial
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
to
petitioner
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
in
august
of
1974
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court,
which
was
denied.
that
is
the
way
to
raise
the
issue,
it
is
to
come
here
and
say,
look,
i
wasn't
fairly
graded.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
and
he
did,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
my
argument
would
be
different,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
in
that
case,
we
would
not
be
dealing
with
a
damage
lawsuit
that
would
have
the
chilling
effect
on
state
government
activities.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
would
be...
that
would
be
a
very
substantial
difference.
i
would
contend--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--my
contention
would
be
on
the
facts,
in
that
situation,
that
there
was
no
antitrust
violation.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
in
the
instance
of
what
you
are
talking
about,
we
would
contend
that
we
were
an
agency
of
the
state
absolutely.
but,
in
terms
of
this
case,
that's
a
very
different
kind
of
situation
because
he--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--that
is
our
position
because
they
are
the
people
who
make
the
decisions
as
to
whether
someone
is
admitted
or
someone
is
not
admitted,
and
here
we
are
talking
about
something
that
is
against
the
individual
members
of
a
committee
appointed
by
the
state
court
as
state
officers,
and
as
a
damage
action
itself.
we
draw
a
very
strong
distinction...
excuse
me,
we
draw
a
very
strong
parallelism
between
parker
versus
brown
and
this
case.
in
the
parker
case,
the
state
legislature
enacted
an
act,
and
the
governor
appointed
a
commission.
in
this
situation,
the
commission
then
had
a
nomination
of
a
committee,
and
those...
and
had
nominations
made
to
it
by,
in
effect,
the
people
affected,
the
raisin
growers.
from
those
nominations,
the
committee
selected
a
commission...
excuse
me,
selected
a
committee,
which
then
made
a
recommendation
to
the
commission.
we
have
a
very
similar
situation
here,
only
it's
a
higher
level
item,
the
supreme
court,
from
a
list
of
nominees
from
the
state
bar,
selects
a
committee
that
makes
a
recommendation
to
the
committee.
in
our
view,
we
are
dealing
with
a
closer
to
the
ultimate
seat
of
the
government
of
the
state
than
even
parker
versus
brown
was,
and
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
statewide.
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
the
state
acting
through
the
only
way
the
state
can
act
and
that
is
through
various
bodies
and
commissions.
the
state
cannot
be
limited
to
act
as
a
sovereign
simply
by
the
legislature
or
the
supreme
court,
although
that's
clear
that
that
is
acting
a
sovereign,
that
is
not
the
only
the
state
should
act.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
yes,
your
honor.
the
bar
examiners
screen
on
the
basis
of
several
items
in
the
rule.
for
example,
someone
must
be
over
21
years
of
age.
under
the
rules,
as
we
contend
they
were
involved
at
the
time,
you
must
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
under
the
rules
that
mr.
ronwin
contends
in
his
brief
are
applicable,
you
had
to
be
a
resident
of
the
state.
the
residency
requirement
was
eliminated,
we
feel,
for
this
examination.
they
also
screen
on
the
basis
of
his
showing
to
the
committee
that
he
is
mentally
and
physically
capable
to
be
engaging--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--basically,
he
shows
that
simply
on
indicating
a
statement
of
his
physical
condition
and
statements
from
people
as
recommendations.
until
you
have
other
evidence
coming
in
to
the
contrary,
those
are
generally
accepted
on
the
first
round
as
being
the
case.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
we
do
have
interviews
and
hearings
if
something
comes
up
in
the
course
of
the
examination
of
the
materials
that
are
presented
that
leave
us
with
pause
or
concern.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
it
is
not
automatic,
but
it
is...
it
does
occur
when
someone
is
in
a
situation
that
they
are
going
to
be
denied
on
that
basis.
but
when
they
are
going
to
be
passed
on
that
basis,
they
are
not
interviewed.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
exactly
mr.
ronwin's
situation,
in
fact,
because
he
has
subsequently
taken
the
arizona
bar
examination
on
two
other
occasions,
and
ultimately
on
the
third
one
he
did
pass
the
examination.
he
has
been
denied
admission
on
the
mental
fitness
category
after
hearings
in
front
of
a
master
who
happened
to
be
a
judge,
a
superior
court
judge,
appointed
by
the
court.
the
court
said:
we
take
this
matter
to
ourselves,
take
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
committees,
and
we
will
decide
it.
that
issue
has
been
decided,
and
from
that
particular
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
also
been
sought
and
been
denied.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
correct.
for
the
purposes
of
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that's
correct,
that's
the
status
of
the
pleadings
as
we
see
it.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
certainly.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that's
not
within
the
record,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
the
impact
of
the
policy
no
matter
how
much...
if
you
exclude
one
person,
and
any
time
you
deal
with
qualifications
there
is
a
very
substantial
view
that
you
will--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
my
point
is
this.
taking
the
pleadings
as
they
are
in
this
situation,
the
point
that
we
contend
is
state
action,
when
done
by
the
state,
is
that
you
only
need
to
have
a
clearly
articulated
state
policy.
that
is
that
the
state
policy
is
one
which
displaces
competition
with
a
form
of
regulation,
and
when
you
do
that,
by
definition
when
you
exclude
somebody,
you
will
have
an
anti-competitive
effect
if
those
people
going
to
the
marketplace
have
a
competitive
effect.
we
have
to
assume
that
for
the
status
of
this
particular
pleading.
therefore,
the
state
action
comes
by
the
fact
that
we
are
doing
something
that
says,
here
we
make
a
determination
and
we
made
a
decision.
this
is
why
i
emphasized
the
point
earlier
that
if
we
were
wrong
in
that,
there
are
other
ways
for
him
to
have
redress,
and
that
you
should
not
put
a
very
chilling
effect
on
state
officers
in
trying
to
decide
these
issues
by
saying,
fine,
you
are
going
to
be
subject
to
very
substantial
triple
damages
to
be
for,
apparently,
personally.
in
other
words,
there
is
an
excellent
article
written
by
professor
areeda
in
95
harvard
law
review,
435,
which
i
commend
to
you,
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief.
i
think
he
very
clearly
points
that
out
when
dealing
with
the
subdivision
of
the
state
point,
the
same
thing
that
we
are
discussing
here,
and
that
is
that
once
you
start
looking
behind
the
authorizations,
once
you
start
looking
at
what
might
be
motives
even,
because
this
is
apparently
what
this
would
lead
to,
and
certainly
the
court
and
the
law
in
that
case
rejected
the
idea
that
you
look
at
the
motives
of
the
people
functioning
here.
when
you
start
doing
that,
you
put
the
state
officer
in
the
position
of
saying,
gee,
i
had
better
be
very
careful
that
i
don't
tread
on
somebody,
because
if
i
do
and
he
is
displeased,
i'm
going
to
have
to
face
being
sued
in
a
triple
damage
action.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
the
article
by
professor
areeda
was
written
at
a
time
that--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--boulder
was
then
only
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit,
and
before
you
decided
it,
although
i
contend
that
boulder
stands
for
the
proposition
that
home
rule
is
a
neutrality
in
effect,
a
passiveness
upon
the
state.
it's
not
state
action,
it's
state
passivity,
and,
therefore,
boulder
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
i
think
that's
not--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--i
don't
think
that's
passivity.
in
other
words,
in
the
boulder
case,
it
just
said:
boulder,
you
are
a
home
rule
city
and,
therefore
you
can
do,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
what
a
sovereign
can
do.
but
in
this
case
the
supreme
court
said:
committee,
design
an
examination.
committee
grade
the
examination.
committee
recommend
to
us
the
people
who
have
passed
that
examination
and
who
are
otherwise
qualified
under
the
other
items
in
the
rule.
that's
hardly
passive,
that
is
very,
very
active.
that's
directing
us
to
do
very
certain
things,
and
those
are
the
things
that
we
do.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
where
is
the
specification?
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
there
is
not
specificity
as
to
the
type
of
exam
to
give,
other
than
it
has
to
be
a
written
exam.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
no,
justice
marshall,
there
is
not
specificity
as
to
say
that
the
exam,
other
than
the
subjects
that
have
to
be
on
the
exam
or
the
subjects
now
that
may
be
on
the
exam,
other
than
those
subjects,
the
dates
or
the
time,
that
is
the
last
wednesday.
but
not
in
terms
of
the
methods
in
which
it
is
graded.
the
court
has
said--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--no.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
that
says,
you
can't
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
policy
of
the
committee
has
been
to
try
to
design
an
examination
to
judge
for
minimum
competency.
that
is
what
it
has
attempted
to
do
in
terms
of
its
efforts,
but
that
is
not
within
the
record
at
this
particular
point
in
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
that
say
that
the
exam
has
got
to
be
so
many
questions,
or
you
have
to
grade
it
this
particular
way.
it
gives
the
committee
the
discretion
to
design
and
put
together
a
test
to
try
to
determine
the
qualifications
of
an
individual
to
practice
law.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no.
in
other
words,
if
the
committee
determines
that
someone
has
passed
the
exam
and,
therefore,
demonstrated
minimum
competency,
that
person
is
recommended
on
that
factor
or
that
portion
of
the
qualifications.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
that
is
not
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
you're
correct,
but
i
am
trying
to
answer
his
question,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
correct.
the
pleadings
contend
that
we
in
some
manner
manipulated
the
grades
to
restrict
the
numbers,
and
that
is
exactly
the
cases
here
in
the
pleading
stage.
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
a
wrong,
no
question
about
it,
but
it
is
a
wrong
that
should
not
be
redressed
by
federal
antitrust
statutes.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
your
honor,
in
fact
the
united
states
in
its
amicus
brief
concedes
that
the
state
could
exactly
do
that.
the
state
has
the
power
to
set
such
a
quota.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that's
exactly
right.
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
what
they
say
in
the
brief.
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
proper
state
action
under
our
view
of
federalism,
and
i
believe
that
the
amicus
pleading--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
not
this
case
in
terms
of
what
is
here
on
the
pleadings.
in
fact,
that
kind
of
thing,
unfortunately,
has
happened,
but
it
is
not
this
case
for
the
purposes
of
what
we
are
doing
here.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
question.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
28(a).
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
discretion
which
the
rule
gives
to
us
in
terms
of
grading
the
examination.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
i
believe
that
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
arizona,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
it's
a
motion
for
dismissal.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
the
answer
to
the
question
was,
is
that
the
policy
of
the
state
of
arizona.
yes,
that's
the
policy.
the
question
we
have
here
is--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--the
purpose
of
determining
whether
you
can
have
standing
to
bring
a
damage
action
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
question
is
not
whether
you
can...
whether
you
did
or
did
not
live
up
to
the
policy
as
it
may
be
interpreted,
but
whether
the
state
can
or
cannot
create
such
a
policy.
in
our
view,
the
state
can
create
such
a
policy,
and
in
fact
our
function
was
the
state
doing
just
that.
the
redress
should
be
in
another
tribunal
in
another
manner.
it
should
be
brought
up
in
the
course
of
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
ultimately
appealed
here,
not
for
a
damage
action
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
that
is
basically
the
heart
of
our
argument
in
terms
of
what
federalism
is.
there
is
no
question
that
what
he
is
alleging
is
something
that
no
one
should
do.
we
don't
contend
that
it's
something
that
somebody
should
be
permitted
to
do.
what
we
do
contend
is
that
this
is
the
wrong
forum
in
which
to
resolve
it.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
what
i'm
is
that
the
state
policy--
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
not
our
state
policy.
that
is
correct,
it
is
not
the
state
policy.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
i
agree
with
you,
we
have
a
perfect
defense
on
the
merits.
but
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
that
under
the
idea
of
federalism
that
we
should
not
be
forced
to
go
to
defenses
on
the
merits
and
suffer
all
of
the
problems
that
you
can
get
into,
because
what
you
suddenly
do
is
put
into
the
hands
of
the
federal
district
judge
or
a
jury
the
right
and
the
power
to
second-guess
a
state
official
if
he
has
guessed
wrong.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
i
have
equal
faith
in
our
state
judiciary.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
and
that
is
where
this
should
be,
because
in
that
context
the
answer
is,
fine,
we
simply
admit
mr.
ronwin
because
you
did
something
you
shouldn't
do,
and
that's
that,
and
he
is
admitted,
if
that
would
be
the
case,
as
opposed
to
saying,
you
had
better
watch
out,
because
if
you're
not
careful
somebody
will
sue
you
for
a
very
substantial
amount
of
damages
and
you're
going
to
have
to
go
and
defend
that,
and
worry
about
the
impact
of
that
on
your
financial
statement
that's
pending,
if
you're
trying
to
borrow
money,
and
all
those
sorts
of
things.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
no,
i
don't
think
we
should
be
deviating
from
state
policy,
but
if
we
are
not
subject
to
the
state
action
exemption,
then
what
we
are
doing
is
clearly
covered
by
noerr-pennington,
because
we
are
making
a
recommendation
to
the
state
that
is
ultimately
the
authority,
the
supreme
court,
that
somebody
be
or
not
be
admitted.
that
particular
grounds
is
another
grounds
from
which
we
should
not
have
to
face
on
a
pleadings
basis
an
antitrust
claim
in
the
united
states
district
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
limited
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
but
one
point
that
i
want
to
make
in
rebuttal,
and
that
is
to
the
united
states'
position.
concerning
the
broader
aspects
of
this
case,
and
the
cases
that
he
cited,
it
is
my
understanding
that
these
cases
are
all
injunction
cases.
i
committed
to
you
earlier
professor
areeda's
article,
and
let
me
read
to
you
the
last
sentence
of
that
particular
article.
he
says:
"having
left
this
question
open
in
lafayette,
the
surpeme
court
may
come
to
agree
that
antitrust
liability
may
vary
according
to
the
remedies
sought,
and
that
certain
factual
situations
may
be
sufficient
to
establish
liability
for
injunctive
purposes,
but
not
for
triple
damage
or
criminal
sanctions.
"
if
this
were
an
injunction
case,
i
personally
would
stipulate
the
relief,
because
we
have
already
done
exactly
what
that
relief
would
be,
that
is,
we
have
told
the
supreme
court
that
for
the
examination
portion,
mr.
ronwin
has
passed.
consequently,
that
would
not
be
remedies
that
would
be
of
any
concern,
and
that
fact
is
in
the
record
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
why
didn't
we
tell
him
before,
because
he
didn't
pass
before.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
he
has
taken
the
exam
three
times,
your
honor,
and
he
passed
it
on
the
third
attempt.
when
he
took
it
the
last
time,
which
was
in
the
summer,
i
believe,
of
'82,
we
told
him
that
he
had
passed
the
exam.
they
decided
not
to
admit
him
on
other
grounds.
mr.
charles
r.
hoover
so
if
it
were
an
injunction
case,
i
would
have
no
problem,
and
i
think
that
is
the
heart
of
what
professor
areeda
is
saying
to
you,
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
redress
through
damage
actions
these
kinds
of
activities.
thank
you,
your
honor.
