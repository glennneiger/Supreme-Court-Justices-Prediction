mr.
edward
ronwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
question
was
the
rules
in
effect,
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
are
arguing
that
the
rules
that
we
are
arguing
about
are
not
rules
of
"pleadings
practice
and
procedure".
but
i
recommend
that
if
you
read
these
rules
which
are
attached,
i
believe,
to
the
first
petition
for
a
rehearing
in
the
ninth
circuit
by
petitioners,
you
will
find
that
they
deal
precisely
with
pleadings
practice
in
this
judicial
proceeding
of
determination
of
how
you
get
into
the
bar.
they
tell
you
how
to
challenge
the
grades,
how
to
challenge
any
other
part
of
the
examination,
et
cetera.
they
are
clearly
pleadings
practice
rules.
the
arizona
supreme
court
simply
did
not
follow
its
own
rule
on
how
to
amend
its
rules.
secondly,
the
standard,
whether
we
take
mr.
hoover's
idea
of
what
the
rules
are
or
mine,
the
standard
was
nevertheless
70.
they
preset
a
standard
of
70.
i
aver
in
the
complaint
that
they
told
us
before
the
exam
that
70
was
the
passing
grade.
they
admit
in
their
answer,
at
paragraph
3,
they
admit
that,
yes,
we
told
them
that
70
was
the
passing
grade.
they
are
attempting
in
the
reply
brief
now
to
deny
that
that's
allegation
of
a
preset
70.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
tell
people
before
an
exam
that
70
is
the
passing
grade,
you
are
presetting
the
standard.
so
i
think
that
they
are
in
error
in
that
attempt.
mr.
edward
ronwin
no,
sir,
i
am
not.
mr.
edward
ronwin
yes.
i
am
just
speaking
about
the
grading
part.
that
is
really
the
only
issue
here.
i
am
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
i
am
obviously
over
21,
et
cetera.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
i
am,
one,
not
asking
to
be
admitted
to
the
arizona
state
bar,
that's
a
different
argument
and
it's
going
on
in
different
ways
and,
two,
i
dispute
that
the
evidence
will
show
that
they
have
not
violated
the
clearly
articulated
policy
of
the
arizona
supreme
court.
arizona
did
not,
as
petitioners
claim,
"replace
competition
with
regulation"
by
creating
the
scheme
to
measure
competence
of
bar
applicants,
that
is,
by
creating
a
scheme
to
examine
them.
what
they
did
there
was
create
a
scheme
simply
to
determine
who
was
qualified
from
who
was
not
qualified.
but
they
did
not
tell
the
bar
examiners
to
determine
the
numbers
that
are
to
be
admitted
as
a
result
of
the
examination.
that's
the
guts
of
what
we're
arguing
about.
mr.
edward
ronwin
your
honor,
i
don't...
i'm
not
making
any
determination
as
to
their
intent.
mr.
edward
ronwin
yes,
that
they
did
do
this,
yes.
they
used
the
examination,
the
grading
system
so
as
to
determine
the
numbers
to
be
allowed,
rather
than
to
determine
competence
by
the
way
they
did
it.
they
may
not
have
even
been
aware
that
they
were
doing
it
because
it
was
kind
of
a
complicated
mathematical
scheme
this
scale
scoring
business.
so
they
might
have
been
unaware
of
what
they
were
doing,
but
that's
what
they
were
doing.
when
i
told
them
so,
they
said,
ronwin,
you
are
not
mentally
and
physically
able
to
practice
law.
i
am
obviously
physically
able.
mr.
edward
ronwin
i
am
alleging
that
they
did
do
this,
and
i
didn't
make
any...
i
don't
believe
i
alleged
whether
it
was
purposeful
or
not.
i
am
just
saying
they
did
do
it.
of
course,
it
is
purposeful
in
the
sense
that
they
went
out
and
did
it.
so
just
what
degree
of
purposefulness
on
their
part,
i
can't
say
at
this
point.
mr.
edward
ronwin
that
automatically
came
out
when
they
picked
the
raw
score
equal
to
70.
see,
if
they
were
going
to
grade
on
the
70
scale,
your
honor,
then
they
would
be
grading
each
examination
somewhere
between
zero
and
100
each
question.
then
at
the
end
they'd
have
a
bunch
of
questions
with
55,
75,
or
95,
and
then
whatever
system
they
wanted
to
use.
mayb
they
wanted
to
give
one
question
double
weight,
another
question
single
weight,
that
would
be
up
to
them.
but
somehow
they
would
come
out
with
75...
70
rather,
as
the
passing
grade,
and
those
below
would
not
pass
and
those
above
would.
mr.
edward
ronwin
yes,
i
think,
when
they
picked
the
raw
score,
they
themselves
admit
in
their
reply
brief,
they
were
automatically
picking
the
numbers
that
were
to
be
admitted.
that's
where
the
wrong
came
in.
mr.
edward
ronwin
i
don't
want
to
make
that
determination
at
this
point,
because
it's
a--
mr.
edward
ronwin
--i
know
they
deliberately
graded
the
way
they
did.
now
it's
for
the
court
to
decide
just
how
purposeful
it
was,
i
think.
i
want
to
point
out
that
first
there's
a
question
of
what
test
should
apply,
and
i
had
urged
met-cal
in
the
brief,
which
has
got
the
two
prongs,
the
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
prong,
and
the
supervision
prong.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
petitioners
have
relied
heavily
on
being
state
agents
and
state
officials.
but
as
this
court
has
said
itself
in
golfarb,
being
an
agency
for
limited
purposes
doesn't
create
an
antitrust
shield
when
they
use
their
powers
for
anti-competitive
benefit
of
their
members.
likewise,
in
city
of
lafayette,
met-cal,
and
i
think
in
boulder,
too,
the
court
has
said
that
being
a
state
agent
or
official
is
not
a
per
se
exemption
from
sherman
act
liability.
as
far
as
just
what
kind
of
a
test,
the
reason
both
the
petitioner
just
indicated
that
he
agrees
with
the
clearly
articulated
prong,
but
the
supervision
is
needed,
i
think,
for
this
reason.
if
you
don't
have
the
supervision,
then
it
will
not...
you
are
not
certain
that
the
sovereign
is
the
one
who
has
declared
the
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
requirement,
because
part
of
that
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
requirement
is
that
it
be
the
sovereign
declare
it.
these
people
are
not
the
sovereign.
if
you
keep
making
the
sovereign
larger
than
you
have
now,
its
legislature
and
supreme
court,
then
this
could
go
down
to
no
one
knows
where.
if
you
have
a
good
cut-off
point,
they
are
not
sovereign.
therefore,
i
suggested
as
a
supervision...
of
course,
you
don't
watch
everything
they
do,
but
when
a
board,
a
state
board
takes
an
action
where
they...
where
they
know
or
ought
to
know
that
this
action
is
going
to
be
anticompetitive
in
an
economic
sense,
then
it
seems
to
me
they
have
a
duty
to
report
to
the
sovereign,
whether
it
is
the
legislature
or,
in
this
case,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
get
that
court
to
declare
clearly,
a
clear
articulation
and
a
firm
expression,
yes,
we
approve
this
new
type
of
action
that
you
are
taking.
that
is
why
you
need
supervision.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
watching
every
pencil
that
they
push.
lastly,
i
also
indicated
i
think
you
should
add
something
to
the
test
and
that
is
the
states,
the
sovereign
units
ought
to
justify
why
they
are
engaging
in
this
anticompetitive
activity,
because
you
have
called
this,
the
sherman
act,
the
magna
carta
of
free
competition.
you
know
that
it
is
an
ideological
linchpin
in
our
argument
with
the
eastern
bloc.
what's
more,
a
congressional
statute
is
being
overridden
by
state
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
those
factors
are
involved,
certainly
the
state
sovereign
units
ought
to
justify
either
by
a
compelling
interest
or
by
a
rationally
related
interest
why
they
are
replacing
competition
with
some
anticompetitive
scheme.
scale
scoring,
as
i
indicated
before
in
my
brief
and
as
you
find
in
those
statistics
i
give
in
the
appendix,
it
certainly
doesn't
equalize
anything.
had
they
stuck,
i
think,
with
a
reasonable...
with
the
70
standard,
they
probably
would
have
experienced
about...
a
much
higher
pass
rate
at
the
time
i
took
the
exam.
i
also
want
to
indicate
that
the
feldman
case
was
raised,
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is
applicable
here.
no
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
being
attacked.
under
current--
mr.
edward
ronwin
--yes,
in
iowa.
mr.
edward
ronwin
yes.
mr.
edward
ronwin
no,
i
just
feel...
well,
i
do
have
some
people
i
know
down
there.
i
wouldn't
have
any
problem
getting
work
down
there,
but
i
want
to
circulate
between
the
two
states.
i
like
cold
weather
and
i
like
hot
weather.
getting
back,
the
feldman
case
doesn't
apply
because
i
am
not
attacking
a
state
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
i
am
attacking
is
the
complaint
of
conduct
by
the
petitioners
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
officially
not
aware
of.
furthermore,
i'm
seeking
monetary
damages
which
is
not
within
the
arizona
supreme
court's
power
to
give
me.
lastly,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
antitrust
actions
rests
with
the
federal
district
court.
in
my
last
five
minutes...
i
would
like
to
also
mention.
i
think
that
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
right
to
be...
to
follow
a
profession
is
a
personal
right
under
your
decisions,
lynch,
and
green
versus
mcelroy,
et
cetera.
i,
therefore,
that
any
examination
given
for
admission
to
any
kind
of
a
profession
or
occupation
has
to
be
an
individual...
an
exam
that
determines
your
individual
ability.
scale
scoring
automatically,
as
they
admit,
rests
on
taking
the
group's
achievement.
therefore,
i
think
you
violate
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
you
use
any
kind
of
a
game
of
that
sort.
lastly,
i
would
like
to
raise
one
point
with
this
court,
which
i
didn't
raise
in
the
briefs,
and
others
haven't
raised
it.
i
think
all
members
of
the
court,
as
well
as
the
petitioner,
the
amicus
and
myself
originally
thought
the
state
action
exemption
was
a
perfectly
legal
doctrine.
i
thought
about
whether
it
was
or
not
because
in
my
brief
i
have
this
notion
about
overriding
a
statute
of
congress.
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion,
and
i
hope
perhaps
you'll
agree
with
me,
that
is
is
unconstitutional,
because
i
think
you
did
in
effect
was
this.
you
say
it
in
parker
and
you
say
it
in
boulder,
that
the
reason
you
have
the
state
action
exemption
is
in
the
interest
of
federalism.
federalism
comes
out
of
the
tenth
amendment,
basically,
and
that
prohibits
the
states
from
doing
whatever
is
prohibited
in
the
rest
of
the
constitution.
we
have
a
supremacy
clause
which
prohibits
the
states
from
overriding
a
statute
of
congress.
another
justification,
perhaps,
is
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
apply
to
the
states.
i
think
that
doesn't
give
you
the
concomitant
right
to
declare
that
the
states
can
therefore
take
actions
which
override
the
sherman
act.
if
it
doesn't
apply,
that
ends
it,
it
doesn't
apply.
but
there
is
no
lawful
right,
you
see,
to
then
let
the
states
through
this
"state
action
exemption"
override
a
statute
of
congress.
that
result
has
been
that
you
have
amended
the
constitution
by
the
state
action
doctrine,
and
article
five
of
the
constitution
does
not
allow
this
court
to
have
any
say
in
the
amendment
process.
in
fact,
not
even
congress,
i
think,
has
the
right
to
allow
a
state
to
override
its
own
statute
because
that
again
would
be
an
amendment
of
the
supremacy
clause.
only
after
two-thirds
vote
and
three-fourth
ratification
by
the
states
can
you
get
that
done.
i
thought
i
would
throw
that
out
for
the
consideration
of
the
court
because
i'm
sure
it
would
want
to
consider
the
lawfulness
of
the
state
action
exemption
itself.
thank
you.
