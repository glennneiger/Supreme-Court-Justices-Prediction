john
paul

mr.
hoover,
may
i
ask
you,
assuming,
and
i
know
you,
of
course,
deny
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
but
assume
that
the
examiners
did
not
set
the
exam
schedules
on
the
basis
of
competence
to
practice
law,
but
they
wanted
to
set
the
figure
so
low
that
very
few
new
lawyers
would
be
admitted
to
protect
the
existing
bar
from
the
competition
of
too
many
lawyers
in
the
community,
and
the
plaintiff
wanted
to
challenge
that
practice,
which
i
assume
may
not
well
happen.
if
he
wanted
to
challenge
such
a
practice,
how
should
he
do
it
other
than
by
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
must
assume
it's
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
so
how
does
he
challenge
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
argue
res
judicata?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
other
question
following
on
what
justice
brennan
asked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
part
of
the
state
policy
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
and
these
various
people
administer
to
limit
the
number
of
lawyers
for
economic
reasons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
not
the
state
policy,
then
how
can
you
contend
that
the
policy
he
describes
is
mandated
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
there
is
a
very
great
difference
between
excluding
electricians,
because
you
don't
want
ten
new
ones
this
year,
and
saying,
we
won't
let
any
in
unless
he
knows
the
difference
between
getting
a
shock
and
not
getting
a
shock.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
arguing
the
merits
not
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
answering
it
on
what
the
evidence
will
show,
and
not
what
the
pleading
shows.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
really
seems
to
me
that
you
are
in
a
position
where
head
you
win,
no
matter
what
happens
you
win,
because
is
you
have
a
quota
policy,
you
can
say
that
is
the
state
policy,
it
is
state
action.
if
you're
willing
to
say
it,
but
you
don't
because
apparently
you
don't
really
have
one.
if
you
don't
have
one,
you're
going
to
win
on
the
facts.
