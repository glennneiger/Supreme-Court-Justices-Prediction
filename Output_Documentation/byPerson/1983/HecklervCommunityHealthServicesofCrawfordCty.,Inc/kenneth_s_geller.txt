mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
dispute
over
the
appropriate
amount
of
federal
financial
reimbursement
due
a
provider
of
medical
services
under
the
medicare
program.
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
reimbursement
of
the
amount
at
issue
was
clearly
precluded
by
the
medicare
act
and
the
governing
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
other
hand,
held
that
the
government
was
estopped
from
relying
on
those
statutes
and
regulations
and
must
instead
provide
reimbursement
contrary
to
law.
we
have
sought
certiorari
because
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
inconsistent
with
the
repeated
holdings
of
this
court
that
the
government
may
not
be
equitably
estopped
from
enforcing
the
law.
respondent
community
health
services
is
a
provider
of
health
care
under
part
a
of
the
medicare
program.
under
part
a,
the
federal
government,
acting
through
private
insurance
companies,
called
fiscal
intermediaries,
reimburses
providers
for
the
reasonable
costs
of
providing
necessary
medical
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
congress
set
up
a
system
under
medicare
in
which
intermediaries
make
interim
payments
to
providers
on
a
monthly
basis
for
the
estimated
cost
of
furnishing
services,
and
then
the
providers'
annual
cost
reports
are
audited
later
to
determine
the
actual
costs
incurred
and
corrective
adjustments
are
then
made
to
account
for
overpayments
or
underpayments.
in
1975
chs
began
to
receive
grant
funds
from
the
federal
government
under
the
comprehensive
employment
and
training
act,
or
ceta,
and
the
purpose
of
these
grants
was
to
provide
job
training
and
employment
opportunities
for
unemployed
workers.
during
the
next
several
years,
chs
hired
a
number
of
ceta
workers
and
used
the
federal
ceta
grant
funds
to
pay
their
salaries
and
fringe
benefits.
in
addition,
when
chs
filled
out
its
medicare
cost
reports
for
the
years
in
question
it
included
the
salaries
it
paid
to
the
ceta
workers
as
a
reasonable
cost
attributable
to
the
medicare
program.
chs
did
not,
however,
offset
against
those
costs
the
amount
of
the
federal
ceta
funds
it
received
to
pay
those
salaries.
the
obvious
result
of
this
bookkeeping
was
that
chs
got
reimbursed
twice
by
the
federal
government
for
a
single
group
of
expenses,
once
by
ceta
and
then
again
by
medicare.
not
surprisingly,
this
double
reimbursement
was
plainly
contrary
to
medicare
regulations,
which
prohibit
the
inclusion
in
a
provider's
cost
reports
of
expenses
covered
by
so-called
restricted
grant
funds,
such
as
ceta.
in
fact,
the
published
regulations
expressly
state
that
if
restricted
grant
funds
such
as
ceta
funds
were
not
offset
from
a
provider's
expenses,
the
provider
would
receive
reimbursement
for
the
same
expenses
twice,
and
that
of
course
is
precisely
what
happened
here.
now,
chs
included
the
salaries
of
the
ceta
workers
in
its
cost
reports,
but
did
not
deduct
the
corresponding
ceta
grant
in
part
because
the
representative
of
its
fiscal
intermediary,
travelers
insurance
company,
orally
informed
chs
on
several
occasions
that
the
ceta
grant
did
not
have
to
be
offset.
travelers
appears
to
have
given
chs
this
erroneous
advice
by
misreading
the
secretary's
so-called
ceta
grant
was
not.
in
1977,
after
chs
again
asked
travelers
if
the
ceta
grants
fell
within
the
seed
money
exception,
travelers
decided
to
ask
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
for
its
advice
on
the
matter.
a
month
later
hhs
advised
travelers
that
the
ceta
grants
did
not
fall
within
the
seed
money
exception
and
that
the
grants
therefore
should
have
been
offset
on
chs'
cost
reports
for
the
years
in
question.
travelers
then
reopened
chs'
cost
reports
for
1975
to
1977,
as
the
statute
required
it
to
do,
and
determined
that
chs
had
received
overpayments
in
the
amount
of
some
63,000.
community
health
service
sought
administrative
and
judicial
review
of
the
intermediary's
determination,
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
both
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board,
which
is
the
expert
administrative
agency,
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
secretary
that
the
amount
spent
on
the
salaries
of
ceta
workers
was
plainly
not
reimburseable
under
the
medicare
act
because
chs
had
already
recovered
those
expenses
from
its
ceta
grant.
the
district
court
also
rejected
chs'
argument
that
the
secretary
should
be
estopped
from
recovering
the
erroneous
overpayments.
the
district
court
found
that
chs
had
not
acted
reasonably
in
relying
on
the
intermediary's
advice
and
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
intermediary
or
the
secretary
had
been
guilty
of
any
misconduct.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
the
payments
chs
had
received
for
the
ceta
workers
were
in
fact
reimbursable
under
the
medicare
act.
instead,
the
court
held
that
the
government
should
be
estopped
from
enforcing
the
governing
medicare
statutes
and
regulations
to
recover
the
misspend
funds
because
of
what
it
termed
the
affirmative
misconduct
of
the
intermediary
in
giving
chs
erroneous
legal
advice.
now,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
impossible
to
square
with
the
repeated
pronouncements
of
this
court
on
the
issue
of
estoppel.
the
court
has
consistently
held,
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
nation
to
as
recently
as
two
terms
ago
in
schweiker
versus
hansen
and
last
term
in
ins
versus
miranda,
that
the
federal
government
cannot
be
equitably
estopped
by
the
actions
of
its
employees
from
enforcing
public
laws.
and
this
rule
has
always
been
applied
with
particular
force
in
the
context
of
suits
for
public
funds.
the
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
the
lower
courts
must
observe
the
conditions
imposed
by
congress
for
charging
the
public
treasury.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
case
would
be
no
different,
for
reasons
that
i
will
get
to
in
a
little
while,
justice
stevens.
the
case
would
be
exactly
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
there
is
no
exception,
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
analytical
framework
of
the
rule
that
the
government
cannot
be
estopped.
the
court
has
alluded
to
it
in
the
past,
although
it's
never
applied
it,
it's
alluded
to
it,
though
never
in
the
context
of
a
case
involving
public
funds.
the
notion
seems
to
have
arisen
in
suits
to
deprive
people
of
citizenship,
and
there
may
well
be
some
due
process
notions
that
lurk
in
cases
of
that
sort,
but
not
in
cases
of
this
sort
involving
suits
for
public
benefits
where
there
is
no
statutory
entitlement.
in
any
event,
here
the
court
of
appeals,
by
invoking
the
doctrine
of
estoppel
based
on
the
alleged
misconduct
of
travelers
insurance
company,
has
prevented
the
secretary
from
recovering
amounts
from
chs
that
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute
and
as
to
which
chs
has
absolutely
no
statutory
entitlement.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
would
be
very
much
like
schweiker
versus
hansen,
where
there
arguably
was
a
statutory
entitlement,
but
the
procedures
were
not
followed,
and
this
court
said
that
the
procedures
are
a
part
of
the
statutory
entitlement.
congress
has
required
that
the
particular
procedures
be
followed.
so
the
case
i
think
would
be
no--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--would
be
the
same.
i
think
schweiker
versus
hansen
holds
as
much.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
it
got
the
ceta
funds
in
any
event.
it
just
didn't
get
double.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
respondents
understandably
have
made
little
effort
to
defend
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
in
light
of
this
court's
precedents.
instead,
they
have
candidly
urged
the
court
simply
to
abandon
its
long
settled
holdings
in
the
estoppel
area,
calling
them
outmoded
and
socially
unacceptable.
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
part,
while
terming
this
court's
estoppel
decisions
archaic,
found
in
some
of
the
decisions
what
it
took
to
be
an
affirmative
misconduct
exception
that
it
applied
in
this
case.
we
have
explained
at
some
length
in
our
brief
why
both
of
these
assertions
are
incorrect.
as
to
respondents'
contentions,
there
simply
are
a
number
of
significant
constitutional
and
policy
reasons
why
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
to
prohibit
the
government
from
enforcing
a
law
concerning
public
benefits
because
of
the
erroneous
statements
of
its
employees.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
such
a
rule,
it
would
really
have
the
effect
of
raising
employees
of
the
federal
government
to
the
status
of
legislators,
because
it
would
give
to
their
actions
and
words
the
force
of
law,
even
though
those
actions
and
words
were
inconsistent
with
the
actions
and
words
of
congress.
here,
for
example,
the
medicare
act
and
the
regulations
governing
it
clearly
provide
that
the
expenses
covered
by
the
ceta
program
are
not
reimbursable
as
reasonable
costs.
yet
travelers
would
in
effect
be
allowed
to
repeal
this
portion
of
the
act
and
overrule
the
judgments
of
congress
simply
by
giving
its
providers
advice
to
the
contrary.
and
needless
to
say,
such
a
rule
would
create
tremendous
administrative
burdens,
opportunities
for
abuse
and
evasion
of
statutory
mandates,
especially
in
the
context
of
massive
social
welfare
providers
like
those
under
the
social
security
act.
the
court
noted
these
very
considerations
only
recently
in
adhering
to
its
estoppel
rulings
in
the
hansen
case.
let
me
give
the
court
some
notion
of
the
extent,
the
magnitude,
of
the
medicare
program.
there
are
some
16,000
providers.
in
the
last
fiscal
year
more
than
$38
billion
was
expended.
intermediaries
and
providers
are
constantly
having
discussions,
most
of
it
oral,
about
how
particular
costs
should
be
handled.
if
every
time
an
intermediary
orally
gave
a
provider
advice
about
how
costs
should
be
handled,
if
the
secretary
were
bound
by
that
even
though
that
advice
was
contrary
to
the
medicare
statute
the
system
would
break
down.
and
of
course,
providers
could
frequently
claim
that
they
received
oral
advice
even
if
they
never
got
it.
that
was,
of
course,
one
of
the
concerns
that
prompted
this
court's
decision
in
schweiker
versus
hansen.
but
even
if
this
court
were
otherwise
disposed
to
reconsider
its
estoppel
decisions,
as
respondents
urge,
or
to
imply
an
affirmative
misconduct
exception,
as
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
we
think
this
would
be
a
wholly
inappropriate
case
in
which
to
do,
and
we
think
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
submit
that
chs
failed
even
to
meet
the
requirements
for
estoppel
under
the
law
applicable
to
private
persons.
and
second,
the
actions
of
travelers
fell
far
short
of
any
showing
of
affirmative
misconduct
as
that
term
has
been
construed
in
this
court's
prior
decisions.
i'd
like
to
discuss
each
of
these
points
in
turn.
first,
whatever
the
proper
rules
are
for
applying
estoppel
against
the
government,
it
seems
obvious
that
those
rules
should
be
at
least
as
strict,
at
least
as
strict
as
the
rules
that
would
apply
in
private
litigation.
in
other
words,
at
a
minimum
the
party
seeking
to
estop
the
government
should
have
to
meet
the
traditional
requirements
for
estoppel
in
non-government
cases.
one
of
those
requirements
has
always
been
that
the
party
asserting
estoppel
show
that
it
reasonably
relied
on
the
other
party's
erroneous
advice,
and
it's
clear
from
the
very
framework
of
the
medicare
act
that
a
provider
such
as
chs
could
never
reasonably
rely
on
the
advice
of
an
intermediary
as
being
the
final
definitive
word
on
legal
questions
that
may
arise
under
the
act.
now,
congress,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
chose
to
fund
providers
under
the
medicare
program
on
an
interim
reimbursement
basis,
making
it
clear
that
the
final
determinations
would
be
made
later
on
and
there
would
be
retroactive
adjustments
to
take
account
of
overpayments
or
underpayments.
and
perhaps
more
to
the
point,
the
secretary
under
this
express
statutory
mandate
has
promulgated
regulations
making
it
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
determinations
by
an
intermediary
on
the
treatment
of
costs
are
subject
to
reopening
and
revision
by
the
secretary
within
a
three-year
period.
now,
the
relevant
regulation
that
covers
this
situation
is
reprinted
at
page
4
of
our
brief.
it's
42
u.s.c.
405.1885,
and
it
bears
careful
scrutiny
in
light
of
chs'
estoppel
claims
in
this
case,
because
this
regulation
specifically
informs
providers
that
an
intermediary's
determinations
hhs
within
a
three-year
period
notifies
the
intermediary
that
its
determinations
were
"inconsistent
with
the
applicable
law,
regulations
on
general
instructions
by
the
secretary.
"
and
this
language,
we
submit,
could
not
be
clearer.
it
unambiguously
notifies
all
providers,
such
as
chs,
that
the
secretary
and
the
courts
and
not
intermediaries
have
the
final
word
on
what
payments
are
permissible
and
what
payments
are
not
permissible
under
the
medicare
programs.
this
statute
and
this
regulation
unambiguously
notify
all
providers
such
as
chs
that
an
intermediary
simply
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
make
any
final
determinations
concerning
the
interpretation
of
statutes
or
regulations
or
otherwise
to
bind
the
secretary
to
erroneous
advice.
the
respondents
have
never
suggested
how
they
could
have
reasonably
relied
on
the
intermediary's
advice
in
this
case
in
light
of
this
regulation,
which
expressly
states
that
every
piece
of
advice,
every
determination
that
an
intermediary
makes
in
determining
cost
bases
is
subject
to
reopening
by
the
secretary
within
a
three-year
period.
and
this
regulation
even
allows
the
secretary,
justice
stevens,
to
reopen
her
own
prior
determinations.
so
that
it
is
clear
under
the
medicare
program
the
way
congress
has
set
it
up,
that
all
determinations
are
subject
to
reopening
within
a
three-year
period
if
the
secretary
determines
that
the
preliminary
determinations
were
contrary
to
law.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
this
reasonable
reliance
point.
it
simply
assumed
that
chs
had
satisfied
the
traditional
estoppel
requirements
and
then
it
went
on
to
discuss
this
more
cosmic
question
of
whether
the
government
can
ever
be
estopped.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
court
had
given
what
it
called
tacit
recognition
to
the
theory
that
the
government
could
be
estopped
in
the
instances
where
there
was
affirmative
government
misconduct.
and
the
court
of
appeals
reached
this
conclusion
by
attempting
to
distinguish
away
five
of
this
court's
decisions
and
by
reading
the
language
of
the
court,
negative
implications
in
the
language
of
the
court
in
several
of
these
decisions.
on
a
number
of
recent
occasions
this
court
in
fact
has
alluded
to
the
possible
existence
of
an
affirmative
misconduct
exception
to
the
rule
against
estopping
the
government.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
resolve
the
question
because
the
conduct
at
issue
did
not
constitute
affirmative
misconduct.
nonetheless,
the
lower
courts
have
seized
on
the
dictum
in
this
court's
decisions
and
have
branded
as
affirmative
misconduct
a
number
of
actions
that
aren't
really
misconduct
at
all,
such
as
in
ins
versus
miranda,
much
less
affirmative
misconduct.
here,
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
travelers'
actions
in
erroneously
advising
chs
in
good
faith
about
some
legal
question
that
arose
under
the
medicare
act
is
affirmative
misconduct.
but
it's
baffling
how
this
sort
of
good
faith
error
of
judgment,
giving
advice
of
this
sort,
could
be
considered
affirmative
misconduct
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
prior
decisions.
the
conduct
of
travelers
here
doesn't
seem
appreciably
different
from
the
government
agent's
conduct
in
the
merrill
case,
where
a
government
agent
told
someone
erroneously
that
his
wheat
crop
would
be
covered
by
government
insurance;
or
in
montana
versus
kennedy,
where
a
government
agent
told
some
woman
that
she
needed
a
passport
to
return
to
the
united
states
even
though
she
didn't;
or
more
recently
in
schweiker
versus
hansen,
where
a
government
social
security
representative
told
a
claimant
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
social
security
benefits,
even
though
she
was,
and
told
her
not
to
even
apply
for
them,
which
was
in
fact
contrary
to
an
internal
manual.
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
found
not
merely
that
the
government's
actions
did
not
constitute
affirmative
misconduct,
but
they
fell
far
short
of
constituting
affirmative
misconduct.
and
we
think
the
court's
decisions
in
this
consistent
line
of
cases
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
intermediary's
actions
in
this
case
also
fell
far
short
of
the
sort
of
conduct
that
might
conceivably
estop
the
government
if
there
was
an
affirmative
misconduct
exception.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
just
one
more
point,
because
the
court
of
appeals'
decision...
there
are
a
couple
of
errors
that
seem
to
pervade
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
i'd
just
like
to
discuss
them
briefly.
one
is
this
notion
that
chs
did
everything
it
could
here
to
get
the
right
answer
to
its
problem
and
therefore
it
acted
reasonably;
and
second
is
this
notion
that
the
intermediary
violated
some
mandatory
duty
in
not
seeking
advice
from
hhs.
as
to
this
first
point,
chs
was
getting
double
reimbursement
for
a
single
expense
from
two
parts
of
the
federal
government.
the
district
court
said
that
should
have
raised
a
red
flag.
it
should
have
proceeded
with
extreme
caution
since
that's
so
unusual,
to
get
double
reimbursement
for
one
set
of
expenses.
if
chs
had
looked
at
the
governing
regulations
and
the
statute,
it
would
have
had
substantial
doubts
that
what
it
was
being
told
by
the
intermediary
was
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
this
case
arises
because
the
intermediary
was
negligent
in
construing
these
statutes.
the
point,
though,
is
was
chs
reasonable
in
relying
on
this
advice
to
the
point
where
the
government
may
be
estopped
as
a
result,
even
though
the
statute--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
it's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
we
can
look
at
the
following.
as
soon
as
travelers
asked
hhs
for
its
opinion,
hhs
immediately
wrote
back
and
said,
this
is
not
seed
money.
the
district
court...
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
had
no
trouble
concluding
in
this
case
and
in
previous
cases
that
ceta
grants
were
not
seed
money.
the
district
court
said
that
no
tortured
construction
of
these
regulations
could
lead
one
to
conclude
that
this
was
seed
money.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
person...
we
don't
know,
for
example,
what
chs--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
secretary
hired
travelers,
although
the
particular
person
who
gave
this
advice
i'm
told
was
not
a
lawyer.
and
we
don't
know,
for
example,
what
chs
told
travelers
in
an
effort
to
get
this
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area...
we
don't
make
that
claim.
we
have
no
proof
that
there
was
any
misrepresentation.
of
course,
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area,
justice
stevens,
is
that
all
these
communications
were
oral.
so
if
the
court
were
to
allow
the
third
circuit's
decision
to
stand--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--but
the
requests
to
travelers
for
advice
on
whether
the
ceta
grants
were
reimbursable
was
all
done
orally,
and
that's
one
of
the
points
here.
the
third
circuit--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
would,
but
my
point
is
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
this
case
that
even
these
sorts
of
informal
oral
conversations,
as
to
which
there's
no
record
of
what
was
said
by
any
party,
would
be
sufficient
to
estop
the
government.
then
you
can
imagine--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
but
in
many
cases
there
will
be
disputes,
and
the
rule
can't
be
that
estoppel
occurs
only
when
there's
no
dispute.
presumably,
if
the
government
can
be
estopped
here
there'll
have
to
be
evidentiary
hearings
to
determine
what
was
said,
and
providers
will
be
able
to
claim
in
a
number
of
cases
that
they
sought
informal
advice
and
relied
on
the
basis
of
it,
because
there
are
constantly
conversations
going
back
and
forth
between
providers
and
intermediaries
about
how
particular
costs
should
be
handled.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
would,
it
would.
but
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
third
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
third
circuit's
opinion
suggests
that
chs
acted
completely
reasonably
and
did
everything
it
could
do.
one
of
my
first
points
was
that
if
chs
had
read
these
regulations
they
would
have
had
substantial
doubts
that
they
were
getting
correct
advice.
chs
made
every
inquiry
orally.
it
never
made
a
request
in
writing.
it
never
asked
travelers
to
correspond
and
give
it
the
advice
in
writing.
chs
never
asked
travelers,
as
far
as
we
know,
to
pass
along
its
inquiry
to
hhs.
and
we
know
that
chs
never
itself
tried
to
get
an
answer
out
of
hhs.
so
this
notion
that
chs
did
everything
it
could
do
and
therefore
it
should
not
have
to
pay
back
the
money
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
under
the
statute
simply
is
not
borne
out
by
this
record.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i'd
just
like,
if
i
could,
to
clear
up
a
few
points
made
in
mr.
hasley's
argument.
the
first,
as
i
understand
it
the
respondent
claims
that
the
affirmative
misconduct
here
was
travelers'
violation
of
this
mandatory
duty
it
apparently
had
to
communicate
with
hhs
about
this
question
it
had
gotten.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
medicare
regulations
or
in
the
contract
that
intermediaries
sign
with
hhs
that
in
any
way
imposes
a
mandatory
duty
to
communicate
every
question
they
get
from
the
provider.
obviously,
an
intermediary
can't
consult
hhs
on
everything
or
else
the
whole
system
would
break
down.
there'd
be
no
reason
to
have
intermediaries
if
every
time
an
intermediary
got
a
question
it
had
to
pass
it
along
to
hhs.
obviously,
an
intermediary
has
to
use
some
discretion,
and
perhaps
here
bad
judgment
was
exercised,
but
it
was
not
a
violation
of
a
mandatory
duty.
and
i
might
add
that
some
perhaps
some
duty
would
arise
to
pass
along
to
hhs
a
question
when
the
provider
specifically
asks
the
intermediary
to
do
so.
but
once
again,
i
repeat
here,
there's
no
evidence
that
chs
ever
asked
travelers
to
get
an
interpretation
from
hhs.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
now,
there
the
government
has
taken
the
position
that
intermediaries
are
agents
of
the
government
and
therefore
they
have
no
independent
liability.
there
is
in
fact
a
regulation,
42
cep
421.5,
which
explains
that
the
administrator
of
the
health
care
financing
administrator
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
any
suit
arising
under
the
medicare
act.
as
mr.
hasley
mentions,
however,
they
have
sued
travelers
in
this
case
and
that
is
an
issue
that
the
third
circuit
has
not
yet
adjudicated.
but
respondents
claims
here
time
and
again
that
it
has
an
entitlement
to
a
binding
answer
of
any
question
it
has
under
the
medicare
program.
that's
what
it
perceives
as
the
affirmative
misconduct
here,
a
violation
of
this
entitlement
to
a
binding
answer.
but
there
obviously
can't
be
under
the
medicare
act,
where
there
are
only
interim
payments
and
subsequent
adjustments,
a
binding
answer.
and
the
regulation
that
i
read
earlier,
405.1885,
is
conclusive
that
an
intermediary
can't
give
a
binding
answer
and
that
an
answer
that
even
the
secretary
gives
can
be
reopened
within
a
three-year
period.
it
is,
once
again,
quite
instructive
that
the
respondent
has
not
yet
explained
what
that
regulation
means
or
how
it
could
have
reasonably
relied
on
the
intermediary's
advice
in
the
face
of
it.
the
respondent
says
it
all
boils
down
to
the
scope
of
authority
of
an
agent,
and
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
employees
of
the
executive
branch,
it
is
not
within
their
authority
to
amend
acts
of
congress;
they
are
subject
to
acts
of
congress.
thank
you.
