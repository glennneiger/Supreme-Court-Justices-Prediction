mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
the
facts
here
are
not
in
dispute,
the
emphasis
placed
on
the
facts
is
far
different
from
the
standpoint
of
chs.
if
we
turn
the
clock
back
to
1975
and
a
little
bit
earlier,
we
find
that
the
federal
government
had
a
task
force
for
the
comprehensive
health
planning
program
in
the
united
states
and
a
local
task
force
in
western
pennsylvania.
crawford
county
had
been
designated
as
an
underserved
community
medically
and
at
this
point
in
time
the
only
agency
that
provided
any
medicare
services
to
any
of
the
residents...
these
are
home
health
services...
was
community
health
services,
and
they
provided
them
only
in
a
small
part
of
the
community.
now,
the
medicare
act
provides,
i
believe,
seven
different
types
of
services
that
might
be
rendered
by
a
home
health
agency.
at
the
point
we
begin
the
story
chs
was
only
into
one
aspect
of
it,
this
nurse,
visiting
nurse
thing.
the
other
areas
were
not
being
covered
for
medicare
beneficiaries.
under
the
definition
of
a
home
health
service,
it
has
to
be
not
only
a
non-profit
organization;
it
also
has
to
be
qualified
as
a
charitable
organization.
now,
under
medicare
when
an
agency
such
as
chs
renders
a
service
to
which
medicare
beneficiaries
are
entitled
they
must
also
render
the
same
service
to
everyone
in
the
community.
so
in
effect,
they
now
have
to
offer
charitable
services
identical
to
those
which
they
offer
to
the
medicare
beneficiaries.
now,
faced
with
this
situation
in
1975,
being
unable
to
serve
the
community...
and
parenthetically,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
perhaps
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
had
an
obligation
under
the
public
health
act
to
provide
the
employees
to
do
this.
but
at
any
rate,
there
was
money
available
from
the
department
of
labor
in
the
ceta
program,
and
while
this
does
provide...
one
part
of
it
provides
for
training.
other
parts
provide
for
the
expansion
of
public
services.
and
it
is
under
this
aspect,
the
expansion
of
public
services
and
particularly
health
services
that
many
of
the
ceta
people
worked.
now,
it
also
must
be
noted
here
that
chs
not
only
was
involved
in
providing
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries;
they
were
involved
in
providing
services
to
non-medicare
beneficiaries.
so
that
in
the
testimony
it's
pointed
out
that
only
about
50
percent
of
the
chs
services
were
for
medicare
beneficiaries.
their
other
services
were
directed
to
other
people
that
did
not
involve
medicare.
now,
how
does
this
become
important?
when
mr.
wallach
approaches
mr.
reeves
about
this
problem...
he
has
the
opportunity
from
the
grants
from
the
department
of
labor;
he
needs
to
expand
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries;
he
can
see,
however,
the
opportunities,
that
if
you
have
this
seed
money
concept
applying
you're
going
to
generate
additional
income
which
you
can
then
use
in
the
seed
money
concept
of
the
expansion
of
your
services
to
fill
these
needs.
at
the
time
mr.
wallach
visited
with
mr.
reeves,
chs
didn't
even
have
a
medicare
manual.
they
had
no
bookkeeping
set
up.
so
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
seed
money.
he
was
with
mr.
reeves
on
setting
up
the
entire
bookkeeping
system
for
chs
so
that
they
could
account
for
everything
in
a
proper
manner.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
it's
a
government
manual
and
it
would--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--pardon
me?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
whether
it's
their
obligation
or
the
party's
obligation
to
obtain
it,
they
did
obtain
it
from
mr.
reeves,
mr.
reeves
at
the
time
of
the
meeting,
and
the
problem
was
after
that.
but
my
point
is
that
it
was
not
just
a
simple
question
about
the
seed
money
situation,
it
was
concerned
with
setting
up
a
whole
bookkeeping
program
so
that
everything
would
be
done
in
a
proper
fashion.
but
one
thing
that
has
not
been
analyzed
here,
but
it's
this
hypothetical
question:
if
at
the
time
mr.
wallach
went
to
mr.
reeves
for
the
answer
the
answer
had
been
to
offset,
at
that
point
chs
had
the
opportunity
to
use
the
ceta
employees
for
services
in
the
community
not
at
all
involved
with
medicare.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
services
that
the
chs
made
available
in
the
community
is
a
homemaker
service.
now,
the
cost
for
homemaking
service
is
not
covered
by
medicare.
medicare
covers
nursing,
a
nurse's
aid
type
thing
which
is
a
little
different.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
but
in
the
question
of
detrimental
reliance,
i
believe
mr.
geller
said
that
chs
was
not
disadvantaged,
that
they
would
nonetheless
had
the
ceta
employees.
they
would
not
have
had
the
ceta
employees
in
this
bookkeeping
problem.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
this
is
one,
this
is
of
course
just
one
aspect
of
what
happened.
i
mean,
this
is
the
hypothetical
as
to
what
would
have
occurred,
the
ability
to
use
the
employees
on
the
department
of
labor
grants
in
a
non-conflicting
way.
but
at
any
rate,
as
to
this
question
of
whether
this
was
proper,
could
this
be
interpreted
as
seed
money
grant,
it
was
in
fact
interpreted
as
a
seed
money
grant
and
acted
out
as
a
seed
money
grant.
seed
money
grants
were
not
new.
back
in
the
sixties
in
the
mental
health,
mental
retardation
program,
the
secretary
had
this
rule
about
not
deducting
restricted
funds.
the
funds
for
mental
health
and
mental
retardation
were
restricted
funds
and
the
secretary
nonetheless
said
that,
because
this
was
for
the
expansion
of
services,
that
they
would
not
offset
the
mental
health,
mental
retardation
staffing
grants.
and
so
that's
the
history
of
the
interpretation
by
the
secretary
in
other
factual
circumstances.
but
in
this
case
there
was
certainly
an
arguable
basis
that
these
were
seed
money
grants
according
to
an
interpretation
of
them,
although
people
may
argue
about
the
interpretation.
in
any
event,
it
was
in
fact
treated
as
seed
money.
it
was
treated
as
seed
money
and
used
that
way,
and
it
would
not
have
been
except
for
this
inducement
to
do
it
this
way.
as
a
consequence
of
what
happened
on
this
instruction
of
mr.
reeves...
it
was
repeated
and
repeated
and
repeated
for
nearly
three
years...
other
employees
were
hired,
ceta
people
provided
services
to
medicare
patients,
which
they
didn't
otherwise
have
to
do,
and
they
developed
a
program
to
try
to
solve
the
health
community
problem
for
the
entire
community.
now,
you
can't
unscramble
the
situation
three
years
later
and
go
back
and
retroactively
put
chs
in
the
position
it
was.
now,
there's
much
that's
suggested
in
the
brief
that
there
was
some
excess
of
funds
and
it
makes
it
out
as
if
chs
was
a
profiteer.
far
from
that,
as
a
charitable
institution
every
time
they
expanded
and
offered
a
new
service
to
help
the
medicare
beneficiaries
they
had
to
take
in
people
on
a
charitable
basis
that
were
not
eligible
medicare
beneficiaries.
now,
who
paid
that?
every
year
chs
ended
up
in
a
deficit
situation
because
it
was
trying
to
do
all
these
things
for
so
many
people.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
in
accordance
with
his
duties...
he
was
under
a
duty
to
communicate...
any
communications
from
chs
were
to
be
communicated
to
the
secretary.
were
we
not
entitled
to
a
binding
answer
at
some
point
in
time?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
i
don't
know
what
affirmative
misconduct
would
be,
then.
if
you
have
a
duty,
if
travelers
has
a
duty
to
give
us
a
binding
answer
and
they
don't
give
us
a
binding
answer,
haven't
they
breached
a
duty
to
us?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
the
government
says
they're
immune.
we've
raised
the
issue
that
if
this
is
the
negligence
that
justice
rehnquist
seeks...
and
i
don't...
first,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
contract
between
travelers
and
the
secretary,
it
seems
that
on
the
face
of
the
contract
the
intermediary
has
expressed
authority
to
do
what
he
did,
to
set
out
the
procedures.
and
if
i
may
just
briefly
read,
in
the
functions
and
duties
to
be
performed
by
an
intermediary,
he's
to
make
determination
as
to
coverage
of
services,
of
the
amounts
of
payments,
and
make
payment
to
providers
of
services
and
eligible
individuals.
he's
to
assist
providers
of
services
in
the
development
of
procedures
relating
to
utilization
practice,
and
so
forth,
and
to
make
studies.
he's
supposed
to
do
all
these
things,
and
if
this
doesn't
put
him
in
a
position
where
he
has
to
do
something
that
is
binding,
not
as
opposed
to
something
that's
not
binding...
on
this
question
about
reopening,
you
see,
there
is
never
any
new
fact
that
comes
into
light
three
years
later.
the
facts
are
always
the
same.
you're
not
talking
about
going
back
and
adjusting
estimated
payments
that
were
made.
in
the
course
of
the
year,
the
intermediary
comes
in
and
does
a
desk
audit
of
everything
that's
gone
on
and
makes
a
resolution
of
the
correct
figures.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
when
you
look
back
at
medicare
there
is
no
law
in
medicare
as
congress
enacted
it
that
said
you
had
to
offset
any
grants.
there's
nothing
in
medicare
that
says
this.
this
whole
offsetting
problem
goes
back
to
once
upon
a
time
when
hospitals
were
charitable
and
people...
the
money
that
came
into
them
came
for
restricted
purposes.
the
ladies
guild
or
something
would
raise
the
money
for
an
x-ray
machine
or
a
new
wing
or
so
many
new
beds.
and
blue
cross
in
its
history,
in
order
to
minimize
the
cost
to
its
subscribers
and
with
a
position
of
leverage
over
hospitals,
was
able
to
make
that
arrangement
so
they
got
the
benefit
of
restricted
money
that
went
into
charitable
institutions.
and
when
medicare
was
set
up,
the
congressional
part
of
it
puts
the
responsibility
on
the
secretary
to
determine
reasonable
costs.
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
reasonable
cost
matter
that
a
provider
has
to
give
free
services.
and
what
you
have
here
is
the
department
of
labor's
money
for
its
purposes,
its
budget
purposes,
and
then
you
have
the
medicare
funds.
if
the
secretary's
correct,
what
you're
doing
is
siphoning
money
from
the
budget
of
the
department
of
labor
over
into
the
benefit
of
medicare
beneficiaries,
to
some
of
them.
you're
siphoning
money
over
into
something
that
was
never
budgeted.
in
fact,
interestingly
enough,
in
one
aspect
of
cost
reimbursement
relating
to
hospitals--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--it's
not
the
same
money.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
the
money
that's
in
the
department
of
labor
is
everybody's
tax
money,
the
corporations'
and
everybody's
tax
money.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
but
the
money
in
the
medicare
are
the
specific
beneficiaries.
you
know,
it's
earmarked
for
the
individuals.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
i
think--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--yes,
we
are.
we
all
are.
but
all
that
tax
money...
all
that
tax
money
was
put
to
use
in
furthering
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended.
there
isn't
any
suggestion
here,
justice
marshall--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--if
we
go
back
into
the--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--pardon
me?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
if
we
go
back
into
the
1960's,
when
the
effort
was
to
examine
the
problem
of
the
state
of
mental
health,
mental
retardation,
and
the
care
of
those
people
in
the
sixties...
and
late
president
kennedy
was
a
strong
advocate
for
legislation
in
that
area...
it
was
apparent
that
new
ideas
in
health
care
had
to
be
instituted,
but
there
was
no
way...
they
wanted
them
to
be
self-sufficient,
but
there
was
no
way
to
get
them
started.
and
so
the
concept
of
the
seed
money
evolved
on
the
basis
that,
yes,
you
are
getting
a
little
more
money
right
now,
but
you
are
going
to
take
that
money
and
you
are
going
to
develop
new
services
that
we
want
developed.
so
this
is
the
seed.
we
are
planting
the
seeds
for
growth.
and
in
this
case,
that's
exactly
what
happened
to
the
money.
it
went
to
provide
new
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
so
in
terms
of
any
raid
on
the
treasury,
it
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
raid
on
the
treasury
when
the
money
was
used
to
generate
the
services
that
medicare
wanted
and
that
congress
dictated.
one
of
the
unfortunate
things,
justice
marshall,
is
that
at
this
period
in
time
medicare
did
not
advance
any
money,
so
that
there
was
a
delay
of
maybe
four
months
between
when
services
would
be
rendered
and
when
any
money
could
come
back.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
pardon
me?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
i
hope
that
our
views
are
consistent.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
it
was
in
fact
treated
as
seed
money
by
community
health
services
in
the
expansion
of
services
for
the
community
and
for
the
medicare
beneficiaries.
and
it
did
serve
the
purposes
of
ceta,
too,
because
as
the
testimony
shows
new
jobs
were
created,
people
were
put
into
permanent
jobs.
so
all
these
purposes
were
accomplished.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
yes.
well,
we
raised
this
question.
initially
we
said,
now,
if
travelers
isn't
authorized
to
bind
you,
then
they
surely
must
be
negligent
for
all
this
problem
and
under
any
common
law
principles
we'd
have
been
entitled
to
indemnity
in
this
situation.
and
the
government
says:
well,
no,
they
have
the
same
immunity
that
we
do.
so
they're
perfectly
protected
and
you
can
recover
nothing
from
them.
so
we
were
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
we
have
raised
that
issue
in
this
case,
but
third
circuit
did
not
reach
these
issues
of
travelers
because
of
the
disposition
on
an
estoppel
grounds.
justice
blackmun,
you
see,
if
you
view
travelers
as
having
this
breach
of
duty
to
us
and
if
you
want
to
call
it
negligence,
call
it
negligence
only,
then
weren't
we
entitled
to
take
a
federal
tort
claim
type
concept
of
negligence
which
would
give
us
a
right
against
travelers
to
get
back
this
money
if
we
had
to
pay
it
to
the
federal
government?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
that's
part
of
this,
that's
part
of
this
case.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
yes.
travelers
is
a
defendant
in
the
case.
we
have
the
two
different
lawsuits
and
travelers
is
a
defendant,
and
we
raised
this
issue.
the
lower
court,
the
lower
court
said
that
travelers
enjoyed
the
same
immunity,
they
were
the
agent
of
the
government
and
enjoyed
the
immunity,
and
this
issue
then
was
never
reached
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
raised
many
issues
in
the
court
of
appeals,
any
one
of
which
would
have
turned
this
case
in
favor
of
chs,
including
this
issue
on
travelers.
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
the
issue.
and
if
you
do
not
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
our
position
on
the
estoppel
in
this
case,
we
certainly
would
like
to
go
back
and
argue
that
matter
about
travelers.
i've
tried
to
just
touch
the
estoppel,
confine
myself
to
the
estoppel,
but
historically
in
the
context
of
the
case
all
these
things
were
going
on.
there
perhaps
have
been
200
or
more
cases
in
the
country
in
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
dealing
with
this
subject
of
estoppel
and
when
might
the
government
be
estopped,
and
the
consensus
in
all
the
circuits
and
all
the
district
courts
is
the
government
should
be
estopped
in
some
circumstances,
but
the
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
appellate
courts,
what
are
those
circumstances.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
as
i
read
it
would
be
estoppel
may...
in
the
affirmative
misconduct
situation.
but
if
you
look
at
the
broad
spectrum
of
cases
that
have
been
litigated
in
the
country
about
government
misconduct,
i
would
suggest
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
some
overwhelming
need
to
protect
the
federal
government
in
some
way,
that
that
ought
to
be
the
federal
government's
burden
to
show
why
the
ordinary
rules
of
estoppel
should
not
apply
to
them.
they
can
be
protected
if
they
bring
in
the
evidence
to
justify
the
position.
it's
a
question
of
shifting
burdens.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
i
guess
this
is
a
case
where
the
issue
will
be
addressed
further
as
to
whether
it
would
be
no
estoppel
against
the
government
in
any
circumstances,
in
which
event
the
government
can
literally
destroy
people
like
chs,
who
have
in
good
faith
relied
on
it,
and
wipe
them
out.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
yes,
yes.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
it
would
amount
to
that,
justice
burger.
but
bear
in
mind
today
that
the
federal
government
is
larger
in
its
activities
than
the
fortune
500
list
of
industrial
companies.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
yes.
but
can
you
really
interface,
can
government
really
interface
with
the
private
segment
on
a
basis
of
nothing
but
uncertainties
in
the
way
in
which
they
conduct
business?
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
but
we
as
lawyers
know
that's
not
a
practical
rule
in
today's
society.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
yes,
your
honor.
but
when
we're
dealing
with
an
equitable
concept,
we're
going
for
equity,
and
estoppel
is
a
rule
of
law,
too.
it's
older
than
our
constitution.
it's
inherent
in
the
american
jurisprudence
system
that--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--well,
i
can
argue
no
more
than
that
every
circuit
court
in
this
country
has
looked
at
this
issue
in
different
factual
contexts
and,
while
they
recognize
the
position
of
the
sovereign
and
these
distinctions
and
have
acted
with
restraint,
as
this
court
has
on
the
problem,
nonetheless
could
you
really
have
an
effective
constitution
that
did
not
guarantee
the
private
sector
the
right
of
estoppel
in
some
circumstances
in
some
circumstances?
otherwise,
as
you
see
here,
when
this
case
started
the
federal
government
was
actually
recouping
the
matter
through
self-help.
since
they
don't
pay
their
bills
for
three
or
four
months,
or
at
least
they
didn't
at
that
time,
they
simply
went
to
deduct
the
money
that
they
claimed
they
were
entitled
to.
so
the
situation
was
at
that
point
that
chs
couldn't
meet
a
payroll
and
its
doors
were
going
closed.
and
you
know,
if
those
aren't
circumstances
where
equity
comes
into
play
even
against
the
federal
government,
even
against
the
federal
government...
this
is
not
a
case
where
there's
been
any
profiteering.
it's
not
a
case
of
fraud
or
misrepresentation.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
i
think
in
some
circumstances.
but
here
you
have
a
question...
you
had
a
question--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--i
think
that
he
could
do
something
that
was
inequitable
and
that
the
government
should
be
estopped
from
doing
otherwise.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
does
the
government
have
clean
hands?
in
this
case
they
have
dirty
hands.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
we
contend
that
we
have
clean
hands.
it's
the
government
that
has
dirty
hands.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
maybe
i
misunderstood.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
not
if
the
other
person
was
not
privy
or
knowledgeable,
if
the
other
party
would
be
totally
innocent,
and
yes,
i
would
bind
the
federal
government
in
that
case.
but
this
would
be
a
factual
question
as
to
evidence.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
no,
no.
he'd
have
to
be
in
a
managerial,
i
would
say
at
the
managerial
level,
justice
marshall.
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
think
you
would
reach,
just
as
in
any
corporation,
you
reach
the
realm
of
ridiculousness
as
to
whether
the
janitor
binds
the
corporation
because
he
happens
to
be
present
in
the
circumstances.
you
have
to
deal
with--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--you
know,
reasonable
scope
of
authority.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
i
guess
that's
the
argument,
as
to
whether
in
this
case
he
did
or
did
not.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
our
position...
we've
had
alternative
positions.
our
position
was
that
he
was
authorized
and
did
make
the
interpretation
and
bound
the
government.
then...
that's
the
first
position.
alternatively,
he
was
duty-bound
to
give
us
a
binding
answer
to
the
inquiry.
his
negligence,
if
it
is
negligence...
and
it
could
be...
is
in
his
failure
to
follow
the
lines
of
communications
to
the
secretary,
et
cetera,
and
come
back.
on
the
other
hand,
he
may
contend,
well,
it
was
the
secretary's
duty
to
publish
all
this
information
and
put
it
out
and
to
have
a
policy,
and
in
the
absence
of
any
policy
what
was
i
to
do?
i
might
note
here
that
one
of
our
contentions
below
was
that
in
1975
when
mr.
reeves
made
the
decision,
he
has
testified
that
there
was
no
policy
by
the
secretary,
and
he
had
searched
high
and
low
and
there
was
none.
when
he
testified
later
before
the
provider
benefit
review
board,
he
said
he
still
wasn't
aware
of
any
that
had
ever
existed
back
at
that
period
of
time.
so
this
is--
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
--so
he
in
effect
did
what
he
thought
was
right.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
right,
he
made
the...
well,
i
think
the
policy
had
already
been
made
on
seed
money
grants
in
the
administration
of
the
mental
health,
mental
staffing
grants
as
to
what
seed
money
was
and
its
application.
mr.
raymond
g.
hasley
well,
to
be
a
worthwhile
rule
it
would
have
to
be
a
general
rule.
but
i'm
looking
for
an
affirmance
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case,
and
i'm
happy
to
go
with
the
affirmative
misconduct
rule.
but
as
you
read
all
these
cases
and
you
see
all
the
problems
that
have
come
up
over
the
country,
you
do
have
to
wonder,
isn't
there
a
solution
in
terms
of
this
policy?
shouldn't
there
be...
should
our
system
of
jurisprudence
today
he
brought
up
to
the
point
where,
if
the
government
has
a
serious
contention
that
someone's
raiding
the
treasury...
and
i
don't
mean
for
the
money
here...
that
they
would
prove
that,
that
they
would
prove
why
a
court
would
not
grant
equitable
relief.
that's
my
contention,
that
if
you
use
the
ordinary
principles
of
estoppel...
that
is,
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
to
the
other
party,
detrimental
reliance,
change
of
position,
et
cetera,
et
cetera...
where
is
the
government
harmed
by
that
if
they
have
the
opportunity
to
show
that
a
court
of
equity
under
the
circumstances
that
they
contend
exist
should
not
give
equitable
relief?
