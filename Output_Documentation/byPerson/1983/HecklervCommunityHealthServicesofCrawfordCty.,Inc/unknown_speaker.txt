unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there.
supposing,
instead
of
having
an
intermediary
like
travelers
as
we
have
in
this
case,
the
query
had
been
to
somebody
in
the
department
itself,
perhaps
to
the
general
counsel,
and
the
general
counsel
had
given
the
answer
that
travelers
gave,
and
then
later
the
general
counsel
was
replaced
and
a
new
general
counsel
came
in
and
said,
my
predecessor
made
a
mistake.
would
the
case
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
do
you
see
room
in
any
case
for
a
so-called
"affirmative
misconduct"
kind
of
an
exception
for
application
of
this
rule?
unknown
speaker
assuming,
mr.
geller,
there
is
a
statutory
entitlement
if
someone
had
followed
the
correct
procedure,
but
there
was
a
representation
by
the
general
counsel
that
this
is
the
way
to
go
about
it
and
then
it
turns
out
it
really
wasn't?
unknown
speaker
would
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
chs
was
no
worse
off
so
far
as
what
it
was
entitled
to
get
from
the
government
after
it
had
followed
the
intermediary's
advice
than
before?
unknown
speaker
now
it
has
to
pay
them
back,
and
it's
because
it
wasn't
entitled
to
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
the
intermediary
have
the
same
substantial
doubts?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
there's
any
room
at
all
for
argument
on
the
fact
that
this
might
have
been
seed
money?
unknown
speaker
it's
perfectly
clear
it
was
not
seed
money?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
travelers
is
just
plain
incompetent?
unknown
speaker
the
secretary
did
hire
travelers
to
do
this
job.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
no
claim
that
they
misrepresented
the
facts.
i
understood
travelers
understood
the
whole
theory.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
had
a
written
financial
report
that
was
filed
each
year
or
something
like
that;
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
but
you'd
surely
take
the
same
position
if
everything
was
in
writing,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
and
also
no
dispute
as
to
what
was
said,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
the
answer
was
plain,
but
i
think
your
argument
would
cover
a
situation
in
which
travelers'
construction
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
one
which
most
of
us
might
have
adopted
the
first
time
we
looked
at
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
i'm
sorry,
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
got
your
point
on
the
fact
that
they
did
not
possess
the
manual.
who
publishes
the
manual
that
you're
speaking
of?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
suggesting
there's
some
obligation
on
the
government
to
see
that
everyone
has
a
copy
of
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hasley,
though,
that
was
true
in
schweiker
against
hansen,
too,
that
had
the
person
made
the
application
the
way
the
government
regulations
provided,
rather
than
the
way
she
was
advised
to
by
the
government
official,
she
probably
would
have
been
better
off.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
you're
right
in
thinking
there
was
some
disadvantage
along
the
line
of
your
analysis.
but
i
think
if
there
is
it
is
no
different
than
the
detrimental
reliance
in
schweiker
against
hansen,
which
was
disallowed
as
estopping
the
government.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hasley,
it
seems
to
me
your
arguing
as
if
the
standards
which
would
estop
the
government
were
very
much
the
same
as
are
held
in
state
law
to
estop
private
individuals:
detrimental
reliance,
reasonable
assertions,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
we've
said
at
the
very
least
it
would
take
affirmative
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
how
is
the
travelers'
representative's
statement
to
your
client
any
more
than
negligence
at
the
most?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
just
a
mistake.
that's
negligence.
that
certainly
isn't
affirmative
misconduct.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
breach
of
duty
is
ordinarily
negligence.
have
you
considered
an
action
against
travelers?
unknown
speaker
but
the
regulation
doesn't
require
any
mistake
of
fact
to
reopen,
does
it?
it
says
the
secretary
can
reopen
if
the
decision
is
inconsistent
with
applicable
law.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
still
my
money,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
my
tax
money.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
we're
interested
in
here
is
my
money?
unknown
speaker
we're
interested
in
the
tax
money,
aren't
we.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
magic
of
the
phrase
"seed
money"?
unknown
speaker
is
it
that
you
can
just
do
whatever
you
want
with
it?
unknown
speaker
that
you
can
just
do
whatever
you
want
with
it?
unknown
speaker
don't
be
misled
that
i
don't
know
what
seed
money
means.
unknown
speaker
don't
be
misled
by
thinking
i
don't
know
what
seed
money...
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
you
say
it
means.
unknown
speaker
oh,
not
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hasley,
in
the
colloquy
i
think
you
may
have
overlooked
that
there
was
a
question
about
whether
travelers
is
immune,
and
if
so
why
are
they
immune.
unknown
speaker
have
you
accepted
that
or
do
you
go
ahead
on
your
own?
unknown
speaker
have
you
instituted
suit
against
travelers
and
the
answer
was
no?
unknown
speaker
you
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
consensus
in
this
court?
unknown
speaker
none
of
our
cases,
mr.
hasley,
suggests
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
estoppel
do
apply
to
the
government.
from
federal
crop
insurance
against
merrill
on,
we
have
said
the
ordinary
rules
of
estoppel
do
not
bind
the
government.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
mr.
hasley,
that
the
meaning
of
a
statute
or
a
regulation
is
ultimately
and
finally
for
this
court,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
in
the
meantime,
does
your
position
not
amount
to
saying
that
some
clerk
in
some
government
agency
can
reach
a
contrary
conclusion
and
that
that's
binding
until
we
set
it
aside?
unknown
speaker
that's
one
of
the
problems,
the
millions
of
employees
who
can
make
decisions
from
day
to
day.
unknown
speaker
it's
certainly
a
heavy
burden
in
individuals,
on
citizens.
but
the
old
rule
of
thumb
is
that
every
person
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
which
puts
them
in
a
pretty
difficult
position,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
still
the
rule,
is
it
not,
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
except
as
applied
to
the
government,
generally.
unknown
speaker
do
you
believe
that
a
government
officer
can
violate
a
rule
on
equitable
principles?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
let's
answer
that
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
talk
a
lot
about
equity.
would
the
government
have
squeaky-clean
hands?
unknown
speaker
in
your
case
does
if
it
has
dirty
hands
is
it
equity?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
in
your
case
you
just
said
that
where
he's
going
to
give
this
equitable
relief
to
this
person
he
knew
better.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
deliberately
violated
a
rule
to
do
what
he
thought
was
right,
would
that
excuse
him
and
the
government?
unknown
speaker
how
low
down
would
that
go
in
the
governmental
offices?
would
that
be
a
person
that's
sitting
behind
a
desk?
in
other
words,
he
could
give
you
$20
and
give
me
$5
and
give
somebody
else
$2?
unknown
speaker
what
rule
gives--
unknown
speaker
--what
rule
gives
a
federal
employee
that
right
to
violate
the
rules?
i
guess
he
could
also
violate
a
statute,
couldn't
he,
on
equitable
principles?
unknown
speaker
you
think
he
could?
unknown
speaker
then
he
was
making
the
policy
himself.
unknown
speaker
he
made
the
policy.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
in
this
case
you
emphasize
that
this
is
a
nonprofit
corporation,
the
respondent,
doing
very
worthy
services.
but
if
the
rule
you
advocate
were
adopted,
wouldn't
that
apply
to
dupont
and
general
motors
and
guaranty
trust
of
new
york?
unknown
speaker
the
red
light's
on.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
if
the
intermediary
is
negligent
in
some
way,
is
it
your
thought
that
it
could
be
held
liable?
