mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
white
male
defendant
is
entitled
to
seek
dismissal
of
the
indictment
returned
against
him
by
a
validly-constituted
federal
grand
jury
by
alleging
that
a
pattern
of
discrimination
against
women
and
blacks
in
the
selection
of
grand
jury
forepersons
from
among
the
members
of
the
grand
juries
exists
in
the
particular
judicial
district
in
which
he
was
indicted.
the
issue
before
the
court
pertains
only
to
the
remedies
and
rights
available
to
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
particular
situation,
for
it
is
common
ground
among
the
parties
that
purposeful
discrimination
in
foreperson
selection
is
unlawful;
it
is
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
the
fifth
amendment
in
a
federal
case.
any
such
discrimination
violates
the
rights
of
grand
jurors
who
suffer
discrimination
in
connection
with
their
opportunity
to
serve
as
foreperson.
our
submission,
however,
is
that
the
distinctive
interests
of
criminal
defendants
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
court
in
the
jury
selection
cases
on
which
petitioner
relies
simply
are
not
implicated
by
the
narrowly
focused
form
of
discrimination
alleged
in
this
particular
setting.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
accords
with
those
of
the
third
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
on
this
question,
thus,
is
not
as
petitioner
would
have
it,
a
radical
departure
from
this
court's
teaching
in
the
jury
selection
cases;
rather,
we
urge
that
consistent
and
careful
application
of
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
decisions,
beginning
with
strauder
v.
west
virginia,
running
through
peters
v.
kiff,
and
taylor
v.
louisiana,
through
rose
v.
mitchell,
and
duren
v.
missouri,
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is,
in
fact,
no
basis
for
the
dismissal
of
petitioner's
indictment.
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
might,
to
the
supervisory
power
argument,
because
it
seems
to
have
assumed
the
central
presence
in
petitioner's
argument,
at
least
in
this
court.
we
do
not
agree
that
supervisory
power,
that
reliance
on
supervisory
power
means
the
abandonment
of
all
analysis
of
the
effective
interests
of
a
criminal
defendant,
or
of
all
standing
requirements.
it
is
true
that
in
this
court's
supervisory
power
decisions
in
jury
selection,
the
court
recognized,
before
it
did
under
constitutional
grounds,
that
there
are
some
interests
of
a
criminal
defendant
beyond
those
of
a
black
defendant
not
to
be
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
from
which
the
members
of
his
race
have
been
excluded.
but
the
court's
opinion,
for
instance,
in
ballard
v.
united
states,
points
to
distinctive
interests
that
are
implicated,
the
interests
of
a
defendant
subsequently
put
on
a
constitutional
foundation
in
the
sixth
amendment
in
having
a
jury
drawn
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community,
or
by
a
process
that
does
not
rule
out
any
significant
segment
of
the
community
that
is
qualified
to
serve.
we,
therefore,
do
not
agree
that
you
can
simply
discard
all
analysis
or
all
consideration
of
the
defendant's
rights
and
the
defendant's
interest
by
placing
the
label
"supervisory
power"
on
the
court's
decision.
therefore,
we
are
essentially
obliged
to
turn
to
analysis
of
the
interests
of
defendants
which
the
court
has
recognized
under
one
theory
or
another
in
the
different
lines
of
cases
which
petitioner
has
invoked,
to
look
at
these
cases
and
to
see
whether
these
interests
of
a
criminal
defendant
are
meaningfully
or
at
all
implicated
here.
and
we
submit
that
they
are
not.
but
before
i
turn
to
that,
i'd
like
to
talk
a
minute
about
the
petitioner's
proposal,
which
is
that
the
court
reverse
his
conviction,
direct
that
his
indictment
be
dismissed,
and
that
the
court
start
over...
the
lower
court
to
be
directed
to
start
over
and
do
it
again,
do
it
right.
in
this
context,
where
we're
talking
only
about
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
foreperson,
that's
a
rather
ambiguous
prescription.
it
appears,
although
i'm
not
certain
about
this,
that
starting
over
and
doing
it
right,
might
result
in
another
grand
jury
with
a
white
male
foreperson,
in
which
case
it
is
doubtful
indeed
what
has
been
accomplished.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
petitioner's
proposal
is
that
the
case
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
appoint
a
black
female
foreperson,
that
would
be
quite
a
departure
from
any
remedy
previously
provided
by
this
court,
and
it
would
be
at
odds
with
the
court's
repeated
holdings
that
no
defendant
has
any
right
to
a
grand...
to
a
petty
jury
of
any
particular
description.
we
think
it
clear
that
no
defendant
has
any
right
to
a
particular
grand
jury
foreperson
of
a
particular
race
or
sex.
and
for
those
reasons,
we
do
think
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
the
other
kinds
of
remedies
that
might
be
available
if
the
court
deems
it
appropriate
as
a
supervisory
authority.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
court
as
a
whole
did
not
really
decide.
they
merely
assumed
the
importance
of
the
foreperson.
you
and
justice
stevens
concluded
that
in
that
particular
situation--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
is
required...
that
is
really
the
central
question
in
the
case,
because
the
question
whether
the
foreperson's
job
is
important
or
unimportant
is
not
one
that
exists
that
in
a
vacuum.
the
dimension
of
importance
is
the
dimension
that
exists
in
light
of
the
interests
of
a
criminal
defendant
that
have
been
recognized
in
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
cases.
simply
because
a
foreperson
is
important
is
not
enough.
for
instance--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
there
are
two
points.
first
of
all--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
don't
really
agree
with
that,
justice
white.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
perhaps
i
could,
because
there
is
a
factual
difference
between
the
system
involved
in
rose.
in
the
tennessee
system,
like
many
state
systems,
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
was
chosen
by
a
process
independent
of
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
and
was
tacked
on
to
the
grand
jury.
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
in
mitchell
v.
rose
essentially
took
the
point
of
view
that
you
couldn't
draw
the
line.
they
said
a
grand
jury
that
was
12/13
constitutionally
constituted
wasn't
good
enough.
and
perhaps
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
view
that
it's
uncomfortable
to
draw
a
line
to
say
what
little
segment
of
the
grand
jury
could
be
improperly
chosen.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
grand
jury
that
was
100
percent
properly
chosen,
so
this
case
could
be
distinguished
from
any
suggestion
in
rose
v.
mitchell
on
that
basis.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
i--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
don't
think
it
would
mean
"boss"
in
the
sense
that
you
must
do
what
this
man
says.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
there
might
be
some
suggestion
of
authority.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
grand
jurors
are
also
instructed,
your
honor,
that
they
each
have
a
vote,
and
whatever
informal
influence
there
might
be,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
grand
jurors
have
the
perception
that
they
are
subordinate
to
the
foreperson
in
the
sense
that
washes
out
the
significance
of
their
vote.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
marshall,
the
judge
is
not
wasting
his
time.
the
foreperson
has
tasks
to
carry
out,
but
those
tasks,
to
the
extent
they
are
distinctive,
do
not
relate
to
the
central
function
of
the
grand
jury
which--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
don't
think
that
the
label
itself
is
sufficient
to
establish
that,
especially
because
of
the
other
gaps
in
the
argument
that
the
appointment
of
a
foreperson
confers
some...
infringes
in
a
defendant's
rights.
and
so
perhaps
i'd
best
turn
to
those
rights
of
the
defendants,
which
we
think
explain
the
various
lines
of
cases
pertaining
to
jury
discrimination.
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
supervisory
power
analysis
enables
the
court
to
simply
disregard
the
question
of
the
defendant's
interests,
we
are
obliged
to
look
at
the
various
lines
of
decisions,
equal
protection
and
due
process,
that
the
court
has
decided.
we'll
start
with
equal
protection,
because
that's
where
the
petitioner
started.
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
relied
first
on
the
line
of
cases
starting
with
strauder
v.
west
virginia,
the
100-year-old
tradition
that
petitioner
invokes,
that
holds
that
a
defendant
may
not
be
indicted
or
convicted
by
a
jury
from
which
members
of
his
race
have
been
excluded.
the
petitioner
is
a
white
male,
and
we
don't
believe
he's
well-situated
to
advance
the
particular
claim
of
injury
that
we
understand
to
be
the
basis
for
the
equal
protection
jury
selection
cases.
strauder
tells
us
that
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
a
jury
is
a
brand
of
inferiority
upon
that
race
which
interferes
with
the
opportunity
for
equal
administration
of
justice.
a
white
male
simply
does
not
suffer
that
brand.
wilbur
hobby
cannot
claim
that
he
has
been
branded
as
inferior
in
this
manner;
in
fact,
the
petitioner
doesn't
seem
to
claim
that
that
was
his
injury,
and
he
seems
to
acknowledge
that
he
lacks
standing
to
claim
an
equal
protection
violation.
but
he
does
say
that
the
equal
protection
cases
set
a
tone
which
is
relevant
for
this
court's
consideration
of
this
case.
and
in
one
respect,
we
can
agree
with
that,
because
the
analysis
we
advocate
entails
no
retreat
from
this
court's
traditional
abhorrence
for
racial
discrimination
or
for
any
other
form
of
unlawful
discrimination
in
jury
selection
or
the
administration
of
justice.
but
it
does...
we
do
ask
the
court
to
recognize
that
the
right
of
criminal
defendants
to
secure
dismissal
of
their
indictments
from
the
equal
protection
cases
has
never
rested
sufficiently
upon
abhorrence
for
racial
discrimination,
but
upon
the
critical
element
that
some
interest
of
the
defendant
is
implicated.
absent
that,
we
do
not
believe
the
equal
protection
analysis
or
the
values
that
i'm
informed
can
aid
the
petitioner
here.
there
is
another
line
of
cases,
to
be
sure,
which
dispenses
with
the
so-called
same
class
standing
requirement.
petitioner
has
also
invoked
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
peters
v.
kiff
and
the
fair
cross-section
doctrine
established
in
the
sixth
amendment
petty
jury
selection
cases.
and
we
assume
that,
notwithstanding
his
race
and
sex,
petitioner
has
standing
to
press
such
claims
based
on
underrepresentation
of
women
and
blacks
in
the
selection
of
a
foreperson.
nevertheless,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
authorities
petitioner
cites
in
this
connection
support
his
claim
that
his
indictment
should
be
dismissed
if
discrimination
in
foreperson
selection
were
proven.
the
point
is
that
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
foreperson
simply
would
not
affect
the
defendant's
right
to
a
competent
tribunal
drawn
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community.
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
rule
6(c),
the
grand
jury
foreperson
in
the
federal
system
is,
as
i've
said,
simply
selected
from
among
the
members
of
the
grand
jury.
and
we
think
it
significant
that
the
net
effect
is
that
any
discrimination
that
might
exist
simply
does
not
implicate
or
affect
the
constitution
of
the
tribunal,
so
that
the
concern
for
narrowing
the
range
of
human
values
and
perceptions
that
are
brought
to
bear
upon
a
defendant's
case
that
was
expressed
first
in
ballard
v.
united
states,
and
subsequently
in
the
fair
cross-section
cases,
simply
has
no
basis
here.
there
was
no
narrowing
here.
there
was
a
proper
grand
jury,
and
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
whatever
benefit
a
defendant
such
as
petitioner
might
derive
from
that
was
lost
here
because
of
the
identity
of
the
foreperson.
and
we
think
this
kind
of
suggestion
is
especially
unrealistic
with
regard
to
a
federal
grand
jury,
because
congress
has
provided
through
the
jury
selection
and
service
act,
a
powerful
protection
for
these
particular
rights
of
defendants.
the
jury
selection
and
service
act
requires
that
federal
grand
juries
be
drawn
at
random
from
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community,
and
the
statute
provides
detailed...
a
detailed
mechanism
by
which
the
grand
jury
selection
shall
be
carried
out.
very
little
is
left
to
chance,
because
of
the
additional
fact
that
there
are
not
peremptory
challenges
on
grand
juries.
in
the
federal
system
the
grand
jury
has
a
very
powerful
guarantee
of
representing
the
community.
the
statute
in
this
respect
appears
to
be
quite
a
bit
stronger
perhaps
than
any
analogy
to
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
cross-section
might
be.
by
contrast
to
this,
no
single
individual,
no
foreperson,
could
possibly
be
the
representative
of
the
community.
the
concept
of
fair
cross-section
just
isn't
very
meaningful
when
we're
talking
about--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--justice
marshall,
my
rules
say
"foreman",
and--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
use
the
word
"foreman".
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
say
"foreperson"--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no.
i'm
trying
to
say
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--to
the
extent
that
we
use
that
terminology,
justice
marshall,
it
does
reflect
that
we
do
not
assume
that
there
is
any
reason
that
a
foreman
of
a
grand
jury
should
be
a
man.
and
that
is
part
of
the
government's
position,
and
i
reflect
it
by
my
usage.
the
term
"foreman"
means
the
same
thing
to
me.
if
i
say
"foreman",
i
would
also
mean
that
the
post
is
not
by
law
to
be
reserved
for
any
particular
class.
"foreperson"
is
a
convenient
reminder
of
that
fact.
if
the
fair
cross-section
doctrine
were
to
be
extended
to
the
designation
of
a
foreperson,
that
would
really
fly
in
the
face
of
the
limits
the
court
has
previously
drawn
in
other
contexts
where
the
fair
cross-section
doctrine
has
been
used.
taylor
v.
louisiana
teaches
that
the
fair
cross-section
rule
for
petty
juries
applies
lists
from
which
juries
are
drawn,
but
not
to
the
actual
petty
jury
panels.
and
we
think
it
would
leap-frog
over
that
limitation
to
require
a
fair
cross-section
as
to
the
actual
grand
jury
forepersons.
we
would
also
point
out,
to
return...
i'd
like
to
return
for
a
minute
to
the
equal
protection
analysis
which
informs
the
case
to
some
degree.
here's
another
reason
why
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
forepersons
is
to
be
distinguished
from
other
forms
of
discrimination
that
might
be
claimed
in
jury
selection.
unlike
other
kinds
of
patent
discrimination
of
any
race
or
significant
population
group
from
service
on
grand
juries
or
petty
juries,
there
is
simply
very
little
reason
to
believe
that
any
stigma
or
second-class
citizenship
status
could
be
attached
to
a
defendant
in
the
eyes
of
a
grand
jury
because
of
the
discrimination
in
the
foreperson
selection.
the
simple
fact
is
that
if
you're
going
to
have
a
foreperson
and
you're
going
to
select
him
from
among
the
members
of
the
grand
jury,
you've
got
to
single
out
one
individual.
whatever
race
or
sex
that
individual
is,
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
a
jury
would
draw
any
inference
that
the
united
states
tolerates
racial
discrimination
and
condones
second-class
treatment
for
a
member
of
a
particular
race
or
sex
simply
because
of
the
selection
of
one
individual.
of
course,
petitioner
claims
that
there's
a
pattern
of
underrepresentation
that
has
existed
over
time.
but
it
is
simply
unrealistic
to
suppose
that--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--justice
stevens,
our
answer
would
depend
on...
i'll
ask
you
for--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--in
our
view,
several
things
would
make
a
difference.
if
he
said
that
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
would
certainly
think
that
a
black
defendant
would
have
an
equal
protection
claim,
just
as
if
totally
without
regard
to
the
selection
of
a
foreperson
at
all,
the
judge
made
any
other
remark
that
indicated
a
view
that
blacks
had
lesser
rights.
any
form
of
it
that
might
thereby
bias
the
jury's
deliberations
or
suggest
that
the
defendant
of
that
race
or
sex
is
to
be
accorded
less
respect--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
i'm
not
sure
we
can
make
that
assumption,
since
there's
no
claim
that
anything
of
that
nature
happened
here.
but
we
would
say
that
there
is
one
exception
perhaps
to
our
general
rule.
that
is
in
the
case
of
blatant
discrimination,
where
a
member
of
the
group
that
has
suffered
that
discrimination
can
show
it.
then
the
equal
protection
theory
might
work,
and
we
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
treat
such
a
case
when
it
arises.
it
seems
to
us
stretching
quite
a
bit
to
make
this
case
into
that
case,
and
because
the
theory
the
petitioner
argues
is
not
that
theory,
we're
uncomfortable
in
excluding
that
possibility.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
reason.
our
submission
is...
and
it
is,
in
our
view,
that
it
should
not
be.
it
is
our
view
that
it
is
not
necessary
or
appropriate
to
reverse
a
conviction
and
dismiss
an
indictment
to
do
that.
and
if
i
may--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
unique
aspect
to
this
case,
because
it
comes
from
the
federal
courts,
unlike
the
state
courts.
the
court...
this
court
and
the
other
judicial
bodies,
the
judicial
conference
and
the
judicial
councils,
have
authority
that
they
would
not
have
with
respect
to
a
state
case
that
came
here.
there
would
be
no
difficulty
from
our
point
of
view...
i
mean
you
suggested
that
the
rule
could
be
plainly
stated,
and
we
agree
that
it
could
be.
rule
6(c)
could
be
amended
to
state,
in
the
language
i
borrowed
from
the
jury
selection
and
service
act.
one
additional
sentence
would
do
the
job.
it
could
say,
"no
grand
juror
shall
be
excluded
from
designation
as
foreman
on
account
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
national
origin,
or
economic
status.
"
and
i've
chosen
those
categories,
simply
because
those
are
the
ones
in
the
jury
selection
and
service
act.
i
do
not
think
that
the
district
judges
could
possibly
miss
that
message,
and
that
could
be
regarded
as
an
exercise
of
supervisory
authority
and
a
perfectly
appropriate
one.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
the
court
has
the
power
to
promulgate
the
rules
and
pass
them
onto
congress.
the
judicial
conference
and
its
standing
committees
have
the
power
to
make
recommendations.
and,
in
fact,
the
judicial
conference
through
its
committees
has
the
power
to
undertake
fact-finding
and
investigation
to
determine
whether
this
problem,
a
problem
of--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
understand.
but
the
court
does
serve
a
function
in
the--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--it
seems
to
me
that
an
opinion
from
this
court
which
indicated
that
although
the
remedy
sought
was
not
appropriate,
the
court
was
in
agreement
with
the
view
that
i
stated
from
a
proposed
rule
would...
it's
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
the
desired
result
would
not
be
immediately
forthcoming,
either
in
terms
of
amendment
of
the
rules
or
action
by
the
judicial
council
or
simply
by
conforming
from
the
district
courts.
we
would
note
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
this
case
reflects
that
subsequent
to
the
indictment
of
this
petitioner,
the
pattern
of
nonselection
of
blacks
and
women
in
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
has
been
abandoned.
there
is
no
vested
interest
in
the
perpetuation
of
this
discrimination
that
we
perceive.
we
believe
this
is
uniquely
a
problem
that,
when
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
judges,
will
vanish.
sunlight
will
make
it
go
away.
and
should
these
remedies--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--well,
justice
stevens,
i'd
say
at
the
outset
there
would
be
all
kinds
of
questions
as
to
the
amount
of
time
that
had
passed.
six
grand
juries
would
probably
not
be
enough
to
establish
a
predicate
of
discrimination.
but,
assuming
your
hypothetical--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
would
still
submit
that
the
mechanism
we
have
described
through
the
judicial
councils
would
provide
a
remedy
for
investigating
the
situation.
the
judicial
council
is
empowered
to
hold
hearings
to--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--justice
stevens,
either
approach
might
be
sufficient.
it
might
be
appropriate
to
amend
the
rule,
because
that
would
send
the
clearest
signal
the
judicial
council
still
have
enforcement
power.
that's
relevant,
and
could
be
relevant
whether
there
be
initiators
or
not.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i've
said
nothing
to
suggest
that
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
ample
channels
available.
there's
really
no
mistake
about
the
message.
in
fact,
i
would
suspect
that
irrespective
of
how
this
case
is
decided,
the
fact
that
it
has
been
decided
will,
to
a
considerable
degree,
serve
to
eradicate
any
problem
that
exists
in
this
area
because
it
will
focus
the
attention
of
the
district
courts
upon
their
practices
and
cause
the
judges
to
examine
what
those
practices
have
been.
petitioner
has
dismissed
the
alternative
remedies
we
have
discussed
as
untested.
but
petitioner
does
not
suggest
that
they
have
been
tried
and
found
wanting
in
any
respect,
or
otherwise
defective
or
insufficient.
under
the
circumstances,
and
given
that
the
remedy
the
petitioner
describes
is
strong
medicine,
after
all,
we
think
it
wholly
unwarranted,
we
believe
that
the
dismissal
of
petitioner's
indictment
is
inappropriate.
dismissal
of
petitioner's
indictment
is
not
necessary,
in
short,
to
address
any
infringement
of
petitioner's
rights.
it
is
not
necessary
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process.
it's
not
necessary
to
maintain
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
might
even
cause
to
call
in
question
the
public's
confidence,
and
therefore
there
is
simply
no
basis
in
law
for
awarding
petitioner
that
remedy.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
accordingly
be
affirmed.
