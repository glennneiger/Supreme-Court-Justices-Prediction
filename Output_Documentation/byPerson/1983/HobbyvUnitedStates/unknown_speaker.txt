unknown
speaker
would
you
agree,
mr.
pollitt,
that
the...
a
key
question,
if
not
the
key
question
in
this
case
is,
assuming
the
truth
of
all
that,
which
we
accept
because
it's
agreed
to,
its
impact
on
this
particular
case
is
the
gorton
thing,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
aren't
pressing
a
constitutional
issue,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
didn't
agree
with
your
supervisory
argument?
what
then?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
those?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
was
that
really
what
you'd
call
an
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power?
i
had
always
thought
that
was
more
associated
with
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
i
always
thought
heard
v.
hodge
was
saying
that
a
federal
court
of
equity
should
not
enforce
a
covenant
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
a
state
court
from
enforcing.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
going
to
explain
why
this
petitioner
has
standing
to
require
us
to
either
decide
the
supervisory
or
the
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
you're
not
arguing
a
due
process
violation,
then,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
arguing
a
due
process
violation,
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
do
you
think
this
court,
if
it
were
to
exercise
supervisory
power
over
the
federal
judges,
would
have
several
options
of
how
to
do
that?
does
it
necessarily
involve
setting
aside
a
verdict?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they
would
not
get
the
message
otherwise?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
were
clearly
expressed?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
if
we
expressed
what
you're
asking,
in
as
clear
terms
as
it
would
expressed
in
a
rule
adopted
by
the
traditional
procedure,
do
you
think
that
the
federal
judges
of
this
country
would
not
follow
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
is
it
clear
there's
a
violation
of
243?
that
really,
mainly
goes
at
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
itself,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
didn't...
you're
not
alleging
that
happened.
as
i
understand
it,
the
appointment
of
the
jury
was
free
of
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
--as
to
which
one
will
be
foreman,
or
foreperson,
rather.
and
that
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
necessarily
covered
by
243,
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
one
other
reason
that
concerned
me
about
your
reliance
on
243,
i
suppose
there's
an
element
of
intent
required
to
prove
violation
of
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
i
wonder,
in
order
for
you
to
prevail,
are
you
requiring
us
to
hold,
in
effect,
that
these
judges
committed
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
chiefly
concerned
with
is
that
the
judges
get
this
message,
i'm
sure.
isn't
that
the
case?
unknown
speaker
you
think
he
might
get
a
favorable
verdict
if
he...
if
the
foreman
of
the
jury
were
properly
designated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollitt,
would
the
statute
of
limitations
have
run
on
the
offense
in
the
event
that
the
indictment
were
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
it
has
or
not?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
before
you
sit
down,
in
the
rose
v.
mitchell
context,
where
we're
reviewing
a
state
court,
a
state's
conviction,
there
really
is
no
possible
way
in
which
this
court
could
correct
the
problem
unless
it
reversed
convictions.
but
in
the
federal
system,
if
we're
talking
about
supervisory
power,
there
at
least
is
a
different
form
of
remedy
that's
available
through
the
judicial
councils
of
the
circuits
and
the
like.
would
you
address
yourself
to
the
question,
whether
we
should
consider
some
other
remedy
that's
less
drastic
than
the
one
you
propose?
unknown
speaker
professor,
what
if
we...
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
respect,
but
what
if
we
did...
that
the
foreperson's
job
is
really
just
ministerial?
then
it
may
still
be
that
there
shouldn't
be
discrimination
in
their
selection.
but
if
we
agreed
that
it's
just
ministerial,
in
which
event
there
wouldn't
be
any
real
threat
to
the
soundness
of
the
conviction,
would
we
really
set
aside
the--
unknown
speaker
--where
was
this
trial?
unknown
speaker
because
there's
a
difference
between
the
grand
jury
in
a
rural
area
and
in
a
city
area.
unknown
speaker
in
a
rural
area,
it's
a
great
big
thing.
in
a
city
it's--
unknown
speaker
--you're
talking
about
the
foreman
being
a
person
that
everybody
looks
up
to.
that's
true
in
the
rural
area,
but
i
doubt
if
you'd
find
anybody
in
new
york
city
who
knows
who
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
is.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry
i
got
you
off
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
significance
of
a
grand
jury
foreperson?
suppose
we
thought
that
the
foreperson
was
just
as
important
as
the
foreperson
was
in
rose
v.
mitchell?
unknown
speaker
and
in
rose
v.
mitchell,
what
did
we--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
i'll
put
it
another
way.
suppose
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
importance
of
a
foreperson?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
the...
what
do
you
suppose
the
court
would
have
done
in
rose
if
they
had
thought
the
case
had
been
made,
the
discrimination
case
had
been
made?
i
thought
the
discussion
of
the
majority
there
indicated
that
the
indictment
would
have
been
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
can't.
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
word
"foreman"
mean
to
a
blue
collar
worker
that
was
on
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
could
it
mean
"boss"?
unknown
speaker
could
it
mean
authority?
unknown
speaker
could
it
mean
more
authority
than
an
ordinary
member?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
he
more
important
to
everybody
in
that
room
than
everybody
else?
otherwise,
why
was
he
appointed?
was
the
judge
just
wasting
his
time?
or
does
the
jury
get
the
impression
that
the
judge
says
this
man,
for
some
reason,
is
more
important?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
were
say
i
appoint
you
as
a
teller,
i
appoint
you
as
a
vote
person?
he
doesn't;
he
says
i
appoint
you
as
a
foreman,
which
means
a
boss.
unknown
speaker
you
keep
saying
"foreperson".
does
your
rules,
then,
say
"foreperson"?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
your
rules...
rules
of
the
court
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
foreman.
well,
why
do
you
say
"foreperson"?
unknown
speaker
are
you
trying
to
say
that
you've
already
agreed
that
the
other
side
is
right?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wondered.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schwartz,
supposing
the
judge
asked
the
bailiff
right
before
the
selection
to
"give
me
the
names
of
all
the
white
male
people
on
the
jury;
i
want
to
go
about
picking
the
foreman.
"
would
that
present
any
problem?
unknown
speaker
and
he
further
said,
"i
like
to
pick
white
males.
"
"i
think
they
ought
to
be
the
foremen.
"
"they
represent
leadership
under
my
standards.
"
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
we
have
to
assume,
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
issue...
i
know
you
don't
agree
it's
that
blatant...
but
you're
claiming
there's
no
remedy
for
this
sort
of
thing.
shouldn't
we
take
the
case
as
though
the
judge
did
something
just
that
blatant,
and
then
say
well,
is
there
any
reason
we
should
be
concerned
about
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
advance
or
any
reason,
or
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
any
reason
why
it
should
not
be
made
clear
that
race
or
sex
is
not
to
be
taken
into
account
in
a
negative
way
in
the
selection
of
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wasn't
addressing
whether
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
i'm
simply
addressing
the
supervisory
aspect
that
your
friend
has
advanced
as
one
solution
to
this
problem.
unknown
speaker
we
could
amend
the
rules?
we,
this
court,
could
amend
the
rules?
unknown
speaker
do
you
realize
that
we
are
not
members
of
the
judicial
conference?
unknown
speaker
the
only
member
of
the
judicial
conference
is
the
chief
justice.
this
court
is
not
a
member
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
could
this
court
do,
other
than
what
the
appellant
suggests
in
order
to
do
what
you
say
you
want
done?
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
rule
were
amended
exactly
as
you
propose,
and
then
the
same
facts
occurred
in
the
next
six
grand
juries
in
some
district,
and
then
the
defendant
made
precisely
the
same
argument
that's
made
in
this
case.
what
should
be
done
with
it?
unknown
speaker
that
he
said
in
this
grand
jury
there
was
discrimination
in
selecting
the
foreman.
what
would
the
judge
have
to...
in
violation
of
the
new
rule
that
you
have
just
promulgated?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
going
to
fall
back
on
the
judicial
council,
there
really
is
no
need
to
amend
the
rule
in
the
meantime,
is
there?
you
might
as
well
just
fall
back
on
that
right
away.
unknown
speaker
well,
stop
right
there.
the
judicial
council
does
have
authority
to
enforce
such
a
rule.
they
could
direct
that
any
judge
who
didn't
follow
the
rules
should
no
longer
be
permitted
to
deal
with
grand
juries.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
another
matter?
i'm
sure
you
must
be
aware
that
not
often,
but
sometimes,
this
court
has
directly
made
recommendations
to
the
judicial
conference
and
its
advisory
committees
with
respect
to
what
rules
should
be
adopted
or
changed.
unknown
speaker
not
through
an
opinion
of
the
court,
but
simply
by
direct
communication.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure
you
would
not
intend
to
suggest
that
those
20
judges,
if
this
court
speaks,
will
not
comply
with
what
this
court
says.
