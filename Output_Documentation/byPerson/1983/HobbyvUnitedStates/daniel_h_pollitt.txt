mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
appointment
of
white
males
only
as
forepersons
of
federal
grand
juries
in
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina.
the
appointments
were
made
by
article
iii
federal
district
court
judges.
the
discrimination
continued
unabated
for
15
consecutive
grand
juries,
from
1974
through
1981.
there
were
15
forepersons
selected
by
the
judges,
all
white
males,
no
blacks,
and
no
women.
the
testimony
also
shows
that
the
odds
of
this
happening
by
chance
are
1
in
10,000.
the
government
does
not
deny
this
pattern
of
discrimination
in
favor
of
white
males
against
blacks
and
women,
nor
does
the
government
deny
that
this
discrimination
is
wrong,
that
it
is
unlawful.
in
response
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government
said
that
it
would
take
steps
to
have
the
u.s.
attorneys
call
the
attention
of
the
courts
to
the
importance
of
nondiscriminatory
foreperson
selection
procedures.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
sir,
it
was
below.
but
i
think
that
it
is
no
longer
the
important
thing.
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
judges
who
made
these
appointments,
rather
than
on
the
forepersons
who
exercised
the
various
powers.
we
do
think
that
this
is
much
like
rose
v.
mitchell
in
regard
to
the
powers
exercised
by
the
forepersons
of
the
federal
grand
juries.
but
what
we
urge
here
is
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
over
the
lower
federal
judges,
and
we
think
that
is
the
critical
issue,
if
your
chief
justice
please.
and
i
would
like
to
address
that,
if
i
may.
this
court
does
have
supervisory
power,
the
grandaddy--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--no,
sir.
we
don't
think
that's
necessary.
we'll
relate
to
the
constitutional
issue--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--well,
then
we'd
go
back
to
the
constitutional
issues,
your
honor,
please.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
i
will
argue
them
only
in
the
context...
for
example,
the
rose
v.
mitchell
and
the
equal
protection
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
what
i
refer
to
myself
as
the
heard
v.
hodges
situation.
herd
was
a
restrictive
covenant
case
out
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
companion
case
was
shelley
v.
kramer.
in
shelley,
this
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause
precluded
the
state
court
judges
from
executing
and
enforcing
the
restrictive
covenants.
then
came
heard,
which
was
the
district
of
columbia
judges,
and
this
court
under
its
supervisory
power
held
that
if
it
was
unconstitutional
for
the
state
court
judges
to
do
it
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
exercise
of
this
court's
supervisory
power
was
called
for
to
stop
the
federal
judges
from
doing
the
very
same
thing.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
you're
correct,
mr.
rehnquist.
that's
what
the...
mr.
justice
rehnquist...
that's
what
the
court
did
hold,
sir.
but
i
refer
to
it
in
the
theory
that
the
supervisory
power,
going
back
to
mcnabb,
and
most
recently,
what
has
to
do
with
the
administration
of
federal
criminal
justice
for
a
twofold
purpose,
as
this
court
recently
held,
which
is
to
deter
illegality.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
discrimination
in
the
appointment
of
persons
to--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--yes.
well,
that's
why
i
preferred
to
stay
with
the
supervisory
power,
because
there's
no
problem
withstanding
under
the
supervisory
power,
if
your
honor
please.
the
three
cases
of
glasser,
thiel,
and
ballard
were
supervisory
powers
affecting,
concerning
the
appointments
to
federal
juries.
and
in
each
of
those,
the
persons
who
protested
were
not
members
of
the
class
that
was
excluded.
and
as
this
court
said
in
ballard,
mrs.
ballard
and
her
son
had
standing
to
protest
the
exclusion
of
women
because
the
injury
is
not
limited
to
the
defendant.
there
is
injury
to
the
jury
system,
to
the
law
as
an
institution,
to
the
community
at
large,
to
the
democratic
idea
reflected
in
the
processes
of
our
court.
so
if
we
stick
here
with
the
supervisory
power,
we
can
eliminate
all
questions
of
standing,
which
is
what
i
would--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
no,
ma'am.
what
we
argue
here
is
that
it
is
wrong,
it
is
illegal
for
federal
district
judges
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
and
gender,
and
that
this
court
has
authority
under
its
supervisory
power
to
call
a
halt.
and
we
think
that
is
so
for
five
interrelated
reasons,
if
your
honors
please.
and
the
first
reason
is
the
rose
v.
mitchell
reason;
that
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
as
mr.
justice
blackmum
wrote
for
the
court,
is
odious
in
all
respects,
and
is
especially
pernicious
in
the
administration
of
justice.
and
so
that's
what
we
have
here
in
the
federal
system.
and
our
second
interrelated
reason
for
applying
the
supervisory
power
is
that
the
federal
judges
had
authority
to
make
these
appointments
under
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
6(c).
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
promulgated
by
this
court,
so
it
is
this
court
which
authorized
the
federal
district
judges
to
make
these
appointments,
and
we
submit
that
the
federal
district
courts
are
abusing
the
authority
given
by
this
court
when
they
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
and
gender,
and
that
this
court...
it
is
doubly
appropriate
for
this
court
to
stop
the
federal
judges
from
exercising
the
power
which
this
court
gave
it.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
we
think
that
that
is
the
only
way
to
do
it.
yes,
justice--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--we
think
that
the
message
which
would
go
out
otherwise
would
be
extremely
garbled,
and
it
might
be
hard
to
understand,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--if
your
honor,
please,
if
i
may
elaborate
slightly
in
my
argument
here,
this
is
the
lack
of
prejudice
type
of
theory
which
was
advanced
by
justice
jackson
in
cassell
v.
texas
back
in
1950,
and
repeated
in
rose
v.
mitchell
by
mr.
justice
potter
stewart,
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist
agreeing
with
mr.
stewart,
but
no
one
else
has
advanced
it
since
1880.
this
goes
back
to
virginia
v.
rives
where
the
court
held
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
then
possibly
start
all
over
again.
there's
a
cost.
no
gainsaying
that
there's
a
cost.
the
cost
is
that
you
have
to
get
a
correct
grand
jury,
take
the
case
to
the
grand
jury,
and
spend
some
money
and
some
time
to
do
it
right.
against
that,
if
your
honors
please,
we
have
the
decision
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
rose.
the
other
value
is
to
stop
racial
discrimination.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
civil
war
amendments,
and
this
court
in
rose
thought
that
was
a...
carried
much
greater
weight
than
the
administrative
expense.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
no,
i
don't
think
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
federal
judges
read
this
court's
opinions
and
would
obey
them
and
comply
with
them.
on
the
other
hand,
if
i
may
augment
a
little
bit
more,
your
honor,
cassell
v.
texas
and
rose
v.
mitchell
were
state
cases,
and
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
in
his
dissent,
in
his
concurring
with
the
judgment
opinion
in
rose,
that
the
states
are
not
required
to
have
a
grand
jury,
and
therefore
fault
with
the
grand
jury
might
be
a
harmless
error.
that's
not
true
in
the
federal
system.
the
fifth
amendment
begins
with
a
grand
jury
clause.
no
person
shall
be
held
for
capital
or
infamous
offense
except
upon
presentment
or
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
just
have
an
end
run
around
the
fifth
amendment,
whereas
you
don't
have
that
problem
in
the
state
cases.
and
furthermore,
finally,
if
i
may,
there's
a
statute.
there's
a
statute
which
outlines
a
procedure
in
this
type
of
situation,
and
it
requires
that
the
motions
be
made
in
a
timely
fashion,
that
there
be
a
hearing,
and
if
the
judge
decides
that
there
is
a
fault,
then
the
statute
says
that
the
judge
shall
dismiss
the
indictment.
so
that
is
the
public
policy
of
this
country
as
expressed
by
the
congress.
and
so...
i
hope
i
didn't
go
too
long,
justice
o'connor,
to
answer
your
question.
but
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
it's
important
to
stick
with
the
100
year
tradition
which
began
in
the
rives
case.
i
was
outlining
the
various
reasons
why
i
think
this
court
should
apply
its
supervisory
power,
and
the
first
one
is
that
the
practice
below
is
odious.
it
pollutes
the
streams
of
justice.
and
the
second
is
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
the
authority
comes
under
the...
to
make
the
appointment...
stems
from
this
court
through
the
federal
rules.
and
the
third
is
the
statutory
reason.
the
federal
laws,
section
243,
reconstruction
law,
says
that
it
is
a
crime
for
anyone,
federal
or
state,
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color
in
the
appointment
of
jurors.
and
in
peters
v.
kiff,
mr.
justice
white,
three
members
of
the
court,
held
that
a
white
defendant
in
the
georgia
courts
could
protest
the
exclusion
of
blacks
to
augment
and
implement
the
public
policy
as
expressed
in
243.
and
we
suggest
that
243
is
still
on
the
books;
it
has
been
augmented
in
1968
by
the
jury
service
and
selection
act,
and
the
policy
of
the
united
states,
as
expressed
in
these
two
federal
laws,
is
that
there
not
be
any
discrimination,
and
to
implement,
as
mr.
justice
white
thought
appropriate
in
peters
v.
kiff,
to
implement
that
policy
this
court
should
exercise
its
exclusionary
power.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
243,
your
honor,
says
that
it
is
a
crime
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color
in
the
appointment
of
jurors.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
yes,
sir.
that
has
to
do
with
jurors
in--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--well,
it's
not
on
its
face.
neither
243
nor
the
jury
service
and
selection
act
mention
foremen.
they
talk
about
the
jurors
in
243
and
the
jury
selection
act.
they
talk
about
the
obligation
and
the
opportunity
of
all
citizens
to
serve
as
jurors.
they
do
not
say
as
foreperson
of
jurors.
so
on
its
face,
no;
the
answer
is
no,
it
does
not.
however,
the
spirit
there,
your
honor,
is
to
preclude
discrimination
in
the
stream
of
justice,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
have
racial
and
sexual
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
by
federal
judges.
this
isn't
jury
commissioners.
these
are
the
federal
judges
themselves
who
are
making
these
appointments.
so
we
think
that
adds
a
new
dimension
to
the
other
cases.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
we
don't
think
that
anyone...
so
far
as
i
know,
and
i've
researched
it...
my
research
may
be
faulty,
but
i
think
in
ex
parte
virginia,
the
virginia
judge
was
the
last
person
indicted
under
243.
so
there's
no
case
law
on
it,
and
we
don't--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
no,
i
wouldn't
ask
that
at
all.
i
would
just
ask
that
a
reason
for
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power
is
to
reinforce
the
public
policy
as
expressed
by
the
congress
100
years
apart
in
two
different
statutes.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
what
i'm
chiefly
concerned
with,
your
honor,
is
wilbur
hobby,
my
client.
and
i
think
that
he
has
an
opportunity
here
to
serve
a
great
public
cause,
as
he
has
been
doing
all
his
adult
life.
but
i
think
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
interests
of
wilbur
hobby--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--i
think
it
might
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
wilbur
hobby
is
president
of
the
afl/cio
in
north
carolina
and
has
been
a
very
active
person
on
behalf
of
civil
rights
and
women's
rights
for
a
number
of
years.
and
the
program...
i
don't
want
to
depart
too
much
from
my
argument...
but
this
was
a
ceta
case,
and
the
ceta
program
in
issue
was
training
young
people
for
jobs,
and
they
were
all
black.
and
so
i
think
that
it
might
make
a
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
i
would
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
i
would
think
this
appeal
would
stay
the
statute
running
of
limitations.
finally,
your
honors,
i'd
like
to...
the
fifth
amendment
is
another
reason.
the
fifth
amendment
in
the
constitution
does
require
a
grand
jury,
and
the
aclu
amicus
brief
points
out
that
a
grand
jury
is
not
just
any
collection
of
16
to
23
individuals;
that
there
is
a
content
to
the
concept
of
grand
jury,
and
at
least
since
1868
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
concept
includes
a
body
of
persons
from
which
no
one
is
excluded
because
of
their
race
or
color.
and
so
for
those
reasons,
we
believe
that
this
court
should
find
it,
or
hopefully
will
find
it
appropriate
to
exercise
their
supervisory
power
and
to
reverse
the
conviction,
and
then
leave
it
up
to
the
united
states
attorney
on
whether
or
not
he'll
continue
with
this
case
by
seeking
a
new
indictment.
if
there
are
no
questions--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--well,
if
your
honors
please,
i
don't
know
of
any
alternative
remedy.
i've
read
the
government's
brief
and
i
know
of
their
proposal,
but
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
to
depart
from
the
100
year
tradition
and
the
expressed
statement
of
congress
on
the
proper
procedure
here.
and
the
government
suggests
that
if
this
court
rules
for
wilbur
hobby,
that
there'll
be...
federal
judges
will
be
lined
up
in
the
docks
while
the
crooks
guffaw,
while
their
mouthpieces
harass
the
judges.
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
i
would
think
that
one
simple
decision
from
this
court
saying
that
you
can't
do
this,
and
that
they
won't
do
it
anymore.
that's
what
i
think.
so
i
don't
see
this
chamber
of
horrors
which
the
government
presented
here.
and
again,
i
would
say
that
the
constitution
requires
an
indictment.
no
person
shall
be
held
to
answer
for
any
capital
or
infamous
crime
except
upon
presentment
or
indictment
of
a
grand
jury.
and
it's
essential
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury,
and
the
way
to
do
it
is
the
tried
and
true
method
used
for
100
years
and
rejected
in
cassell
when
it
was
raised,
rejected
when
it
was
raised
again
in
rose
v.
mitchell,
and
i
know
that
those
were
state
cases
and
i
think
that
adds
to
the
strength
here
of
using
the
supervisory
power
instead
of
going
to
the
constitution.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
well,
if
your
honors
please,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
it
was
argued
6(c),
and
the
fourth
circuit
looked
at
6(c)
and
6(c)
looks
like
the
foreperson
is
ministerial.
section
6(c)
has
three
functions.
the
foreman
administers
the
oaths,
he
signs
the
indictments,
and
he
keeps
a
tally
of
the
votes.
but
if
you
go
beyond
6(c),
which
we
do
in
our
brief,
and
we
go
to
the
handbook
prepared
by
the
judicial
conference,
and
that
sets
forth
a
number
of
other
functions.
first
of
all,
the
foreperson
is
selected
by
the
federal
judge
in
open
court
in
the
presence
of
everyone
else,
so
he
gets
a
certain
honor
and
glamour
from
the
appointment.
and
then,
during
the
ensuing
18
months,
if
anyone
on
the
grand
jury
wants
to
be
excused,
they
go
to
the
foreman.
the
foreman
has
the
power...
they
have
to
go
to
the
foreman
to
be
excused.
and
then
if
they
want
to
communicate
with
the
judge
or
with
the
u.s.
attorney,
they
do
it
through
the
foreman.
and
then
the
foreman
has
the
gavel.
the
foreman
asks
the
first
question
after
the
u.s.
attorney
is
through,
and
then
he
recognizes
the
others,
and
when
he
thinks
there's
enough,
he
hits
the
gavel.
and
then
when
all
the
witnesses
are
gone
and
they
start
their
deliberations,
again
the
foreperson
initiates
the
discussion.
he
has
the
gavel,
and
he
controls
it.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
it
was...
the
trial
was
in
raleigh,
north
carolina,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
well,
where
the
eastern
district...
the
grand
jury
is
drawn
from
the
eastern
district,
which
stretches
to
the
ocean
at
wilmington.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
yes,
sir.
well,
the
grand
jury
came...
the
grand
jury
wheel
was
drawn
from
the
entire
district,
not
just
from
the
city
of
raleigh.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
well,
i
really
don't...
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
raleigh,
north
carolina,
they
know
who
the
foreperson
is.
and
my
final
thing
which
is...
may
not
be
important--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--oh,
no,
sir.
i
appreciate
your
question,
because
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
respond,
that
unlike
new
york,
in
north
carolina
the
foreman
does
have
the
bible.
he
has
not
only
the
gavel,
he
has
the
bible,
and
he
administers
the
oath,
and
that's
no
little
thing
in
north
carolina,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
yes,
sir.
i
have--
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
--i
certainly
won't
take
that
much
time,
your
honor,
i
hope.
i'd
just
like
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
our
brief
again
about
the
importance
of
the
foreperson,
where
we
discuss
the
testimony
of
the
20
district
judges
who
had
appointed
forepersons
of
the
grand
jury,
and
they
all
said
that
they
looked
for
strong
people
who
could
keep
23
grand
jurors
in
line,
and
they
also
looked
for
strong
people
because
it's
the
foreperson
who
stands
between
the
government
and
an
indictment.
so
the
20
judges
are
in
agreement
that
the
foreperson
is
not
a
cipher
or
a
clerk.
mr.
daniel
h.
pollitt
oh,
no.
not
at
all.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
slightly
over
100
years
ago,
in
neal
v.
delaware,
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
violent
presumption
which
could
not
be
accepted
that
all
members
of
the
black
race
in
delaware
were
utterly
disqualified
to
sit
as
jurors
by
want
of
intelligence,
experience,
and
moral
integrity.
today,
if
your
honors
please,
it
is
still
a
violent
presumption
which
cannot
be
accepted,
that
all
blacks
and
women
called
for
grand
jury
service
in
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina
are
utterly
disqualified
to
hold
the
leadership
positions
by
want
of
intelligence,
experience,
or
moral
integrity.
your
honors,
this
is
a
very
important
case
or
it
would
not
be
here.
it
involves
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
justice.
and
i
would
like
to
close
by
reminding
this
court
that,
from
rose
v.
mitchell,
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
odicus
in
all
aspects,
is
especially
pernicious
in
the
administration
of
justice.
and
from
smith
v.
texas,
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black,
"discrimination
in
the
grand
jury
system
is
at
war
with
our
basic
concepts
of
a
democratic
society
and
a
representative
government.
"
and
that
is
what
is
at
issue
here
today,
if
your
honors
please.
now,
the
remedy
we
seek
may
be
strong
medicine,
but
unfortunately,
the
disease
of
racism
is
still
rampant
today
in
certain
quarters,
and
we
think
that
the
remedy
we
call
for
is
traditional
and
highly
appropriate.
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
to
present
our
cause
here
today.
