mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
you...
the
language
in
6501(c)(1)
and
(3)
are
identical.
what
you
are
referring
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
straight
forward
question
of
statutory
construction.
section
6501(a)
provides
in
general
that
the
commissioner
must
assess
the
tax
within
three
years
of
the
date
a
return
is
filed.
section
6501(c)(1)
has
an
exception
to
this
rule.
it
says
that
in
the
case
of
a
false
or
fraudulent
return
filed
with
the
intent
to
evade
tax,
the
tax
may
be
assessed
at
any
time.
the
code
has
allowed
the
commissioner
to
assess
the
tax
at
any
time
in
broad
cases
since
1918.
we
think
the
words
of
the
statute
are
clear
and
unambiguous.
section
6501(c)(1),
the
at-any-time
provision,
plainly
came
into
operation
when
the
taxpayers
filed
their
original
returns
here
because
those
returns
were,
or
are
deemed
for
present
purposes,
to
have
been
false
and
fraudulent.
and,
there
is
nothing
in
that
section
which
could
serve
to
call
off
its
operation
by
reference
to
a
fraudulent
filer's
later
conduct,
be
it
the
filing
of
an
amended
return
or
doing
anything
else.
likewise,
subsection
(a),
with
the
three-year
rule,
plainly
did
not
come
into
play
when
taxpayers
filed
their
original
returns
here
because
that
section,
by
its
terms,
cannot
apply
when
the
return
is
false
and
fraudulent.
and,
there
is
nothing
in
subsection
(a)
which
could
cause
its
general
three-year
rule
to
come
into
effect
later
on
depending
on
the
filing
of
an
amended
return.
when
one
recalls
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
we
would
agree,
justice
stevens,
it
is
a
return,
but
the
phrase
used
in
(a)
is
"the
return",
and
the
court
early
on--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--you
are
presupposing
the
argument
that
dowell
made
that
the
fraudulent
return
was
not
a
return.
we
think
that
must
fall
because
(c)(1)
uses
the
phrase
"fraudulent
return".
it
must
be
a
return
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
we
are
construing.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
our
view
is
that
an
amended
return,
if
accepted
by
the
commissioner,
is
a
return
for
the
tax
year,
but
it
is
not
the
return
referred
to
in
(a).
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
because
congress,
by
using
a
definite
article,
we
think,
indicated
that
it
meant
the
original
return
for
the
year,
not
an
amended
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
because
then
we
would
still
be
covered
by
(c)(1).
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
wouldn't
be
quite
as
clear.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
would
give
us
only
one
string
rather
than
two
to
our
bow
which
i
think
we
have
now.
but,
one
recalls
that
as
this
court
has
held
a
limitations
period
must
be
construed
strictly
in
favor
of
the
government.
we
think
the
plain
language
of
the
code
here,
given
a
natural
reading,
indicates
that
once
a
false
return
has
been
filed,
the
commissioner
has
an
unlimited
period
to
assess
the
tax,
whatever
the
taxpayer
does.
we
think
this
natural
reading
of
the
statute
is
confirmed
if
one
looks
to
the
structure
and
operation
of
other
code
provisions.
to
begin
with
it
is
clear
that
a
taxpayer
who
has
filed
a
false
return
remains
liable
for
criminal
and
civil
fraud
penalties
on
that
account
regardless
of
later
repentant
conduct.
the
fraud
is
complete
when
the
fraudulent
return
is
filed.
in
short,
the
case
remains
a
case
of
a
false
or
fraudulent
return
despite
the
filing
of
an
honest
amended
return
indefinitely
for
purposes
of
imposing
substantive
fraud
liability.
we
think
it
is
logical
to
infer
from
that
that
the
case
should
also
remain
a
case--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--or
from
an
anonymous
tip
or
a
third
party
or
bank
or
an
accounting
firm
or
anyone.
we
think
it
is
just
another
form
of
information
the
commissioner
has
to
process
in
doing
its
fraud
investigation.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
what
happened
in
deleet--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
believe
after
we
investigated
the
return
of
badaracco,
i
think
that
turned
out
to
be
accurate.
in
deleet--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--yes,
we
could
have.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
because
the
commission
is
empowered
not
only
to
assess
the
fraud
penalty
but
the
tax
at
any
time
in
a
fraud
case.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that
is
what
happened
in
deleet,
justice
white.
what
deleet
did--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--why?
because
the
amended
return,
we
submit,
has
no
relevance
in
determining
the
limitations
period
in
fraud
cases.
the
statute
says
"at
any
time".
what
happened
in
the
deleet
case
was
the
amended
return
reported
the
omitted
gross
income
of
the
corporation,
but
it
also
claimed
a
deduction
in
the
exact
same
amount.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no,
there
cannot,
justice
white,
because,
as
counsel
for
petitioner--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
congress
might
have
done
that,
but
they
didn't,
because
a
fraud
penalty
is
a
colloquial
phrase
to
refer
to
an
addition
to
the
tax
on
account
of
fraud.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
is
all
one
ball
of
wax.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
then
there
would
be
no--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--if
there
were
no
finding
of
fraud,
we
wouldn't
have
the
unlimited
period.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
because
it
only
applies
in
cases
of
a
false
or
fraudulent
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
you
make
another
amended
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
are
saying
if
there
is
fraud
in
the
original
return,
we
can
assess
additional
tax
itself
plus
what
we
call
the
fraud
penalty
indefinitely,
no
matter
how
many
amended
returns
the
taxpayer
files.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly.
it
would
not
be
a
second
act
of
fraud
if
the
amended
return
were
honest.
that
doesn't
matter.
we
are
going
back
to
the
antecedent
fraud
on
the
original
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
if
the
taxpayer
voluntarily
pays...
if
his
return
is
accurate
and
he
voluntarily
pays--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
that
return
is
completely
accurate
and
it
correctly
computes
the
fraud
penalty,
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
government
to
do.
we
have
gotten
all
we
can
on--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
then
he
would
have
incorrectly
computed
his
fraud
penalty
because
if
we
audit
the
return
further
and
determine
that
he
got
the
deficiency
wrong,
although
he
tried
to
be
honest,
he
got
it
wrong,
he
got
the
fraud
penalty
wrong
too.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
would.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
no.
a
taxpayer
can
amend--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--accepted,
that
is
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
the
starting
date
is
the
first
return.
the
finishing
date
is
perpetuity.
our
position
is
whenever
the
first
return
is
fraudulent,
we
have
forever
to
come
against
the
taxpayer.
that
is
the
language
the
statute
requires.
i
think
this
language
is
also
supported
by
the
fact
that
amended
returns
are
not
even
recognized
by
the
code.
the
code
does
not
permit,
officially
permit
the
taxpayer
to
file
amended
returns
nor
does
it
require
the
commissioner
to
accept
them
if
they
are
filed.
indeed,
this
court
last
term
in
hillsboro
bank
noted
that
amended
returns
are
entirely
creatures
of
irs
art
and
the
commissioner
has
discretion
to
reject
them.
now,
because
amended
returns
are
not
part
of
the
structure
that
congress
enacted
in
the
code,
and
because
the
commissioner
can
reject
them
in
his
discretion,
we
think
congress
is
very
unlikely
to
have
intended
that
these
documents
would
have
any
kind
of
controlling
effect
on
the
operation
of
the
limitations
rules.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
the
first
return
is
not
fraudulent,
but
inaccurate?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
three
years
from
the
original
return.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
this
court
held
in
a
companion
case
to
zellerbach
paper
that
an
amended
return,
if
both
the
amended
and
original
are
honest,
it
does
not
give
the
commissioner
more
time.
it
is
three
years
from
the
original
return's
filing
date.
now,
because
we
think
that
language
of
the
code
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and
because
we
think
that
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute
is
confirmed
by
the
operation
of
other
code
provisions,
there
is
no
need
here
to
go
on
to
look
at
tax
policy
as
a
basis
for
decision.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
bennett
is
where
there
is
fraudulent
failure
to
file
any
return
at
all.
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
not
easier
to
detect
fraud
there.
but,
what
happens
in
practice
is
the
commissioner
brings
very,
very
few
actions,
prosecutions
on
the
criminal
front
for
fraudulent
non-filing.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
is
very
hard
to
get
a
jury
to
buy
the
fact
that
a
guy
committed
fraud
if
he
did
nothing
at
all.
so,
in
fact,
there
are
only
a
handful
of
those
prosecutions.
what
the
government
does
is
alternatively
bring
a
prosecution
for
willful
failure
to
file
where
fraud
need
not
be
proven
and
this
is
only
a
misdemeanor
rather
than
a
felony.
so,
in
practice,
the
way
we
deal
with
that
problem
is
to
go
the
other
route.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
is
hard
to
make
up
a
jury
instruction
on
that.
willfull,
i
guess,
is
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty
and
fraud
connotes
something
about
bad
acts
beyond
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
yes.
but,
in
effect,
the
commissioner
generally
does
not
indict
for
fraudulent
failure
to
file.
now,
of
course,
the
petitioners,
of
course,
base
their
entire
case
on
tax
policy.
their
view
is
that
once
the
commissioner
has
an
amended
return
that
ultimately
turns
out
to
be
non-fraudulent,
he
doesn't
need
the
additional
time
provided
by
section
(c)(1).
at
that
point,
petitioners
contend
that
the
commissioner's
fraud
investigation
should
be
limited
by
the
three-year
rule
that
applies
in
non-fraud
cases.
we
think
this
argument
is
wrong
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
determining
that,
in
fact,
strong
reasons
of
tax
policy
support
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute.
first
of
all,
the
filing
of
an
amended
return,
however
honest
it
ultimately
proves
to
be,
does
not
really
change
the
nature
of
a
tax
fraud
investigation.
congress
chose
to
permit
assessment
at
any
time
in
fraud
cases
for
very
good
reasons.
fraud
is
hard
to
investigate,
both
because
the
controlling
issue
is
one
of
intent
and
because
fraud
is
often
accompanied
by
its
badges
such
the
falsification
or
destruction
of
records.
beyond
that
the
commissioner
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
fraud
issue.
but,
the
reasons
that
lead
congress
to
enact
the
at-any-time
rule
in
fraud
cases
persists
even
though
the
taxpayer
files
an
amended
return.
the
case
is
still
a
fraud
case
with
all
the
attendant
problems
of
examination
and
the
commissioner
still
has
the
burden
of
proof.
an
amended
return
comes
with
no
imprimatur
upon
it.
indeed,
it
comes
from
a
taxpayer
who
has
already
made
false
statements
under
penalties
of
perjury.
in
our
view
the
data
on
the
amended
return
are
no
different
from
any
other
data
that
come
into
the
commissioner's
hand
during
a
tax
fraud
investigation.
it
must
be
examined
just
as
carefully.
that
point
might
be
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
the
cases
before
us
today.
in
these
cases,
the
fraud
consisted
of
diverting
business
receivables
into
the
secret
bank
accounts
maintained
on
behalf
of
the
company's
employees.
now,
the
commissioner
could
have
been
alerted
to
that
fraud,
both
the
facts
of
the
fraud
and
the
amount
of
the
diverted
receipts
in
any
number
of
ways.
it
could
have
been
a
tip
from
an
unhappy
employee,
as
indeed
almost
happened
in
deleet,
it
could
have
been
a
tip
from
a
competitor
or
supplier
or
customer
of
the
business,
or
it
could
have
come
from
a
bank
or
accounting
firm.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
contended
that
had
the
commissioner
got
this
useful,
correct
information
from
a
third
party,
the
three-year
rule
would
then
all
of
a
sudden
applied
in
the
fraud
case.
we
think
there
is
no
reason
on
grounds
of
tax
policy
for
a
different
result
merely
because
that
data
happens
to
be
contained
in
the
vehicle
of
an
amended
return.
in
short,
our
view
is
that
the
commissioner's
need
for
an
unlimited
period
of
assessment
in
fraud
cases
is
not
materially
diminished
by
the
filing
of
an
amended
return.
and,
we
think
there
is
no
reason
to
hold
that
amended
returns
of
all
the
manifold
documents
and
data
that
might
bear
on
tax
fraud
has
the
unique
effect,
the
singular
effect,
of
shortening
to
three
years
the
unlimited
period
that
governs
fraud
cases
generally.
we
think
there
is
a
second
and
discreet
reason
for
holding
on
grounds
of
tax
policy,
that
the
three-year
rule
should
not
come
into
play
in
tax
fraud
cases.
this
has
to
do
with
the
commissioner's
duty
to
pursue
criminal
tax
enforcement.
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
past,
congress
has
charged
the
commissioner
with
pursuing
both
criminal
and
civil
aspects
in
tax
fraud.
limitations
period
for
prosecuting
criminal
tax
fraud
is
not
three
but
six
years.
as
a
result,
it
will
often
be
impossible
on
a
practical
ground
and
unwise
as
a
matter
of
efficient
and
sound
tax
administration
for
the
commissioner
to
close
down
his
civil
audit
within
three
years
of
getting
an
amended
return
on
the
taxpayer.
the
practical
problems
here
we
think
are
fairly
evident.
once
the
commissioner
makes
a
referral
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
prosecution,
he
loses
his
primary
audit
tool;
that
is
his
power
to
summons
the
books,
records,
and
testimony
of
the
taxpayers
and
third
parties.
this
result
is
required
by
lasalle
bank,
from
this
court,
and
by
congress'
later
amendment
of
code
section
7602.
but,
that
means,
having
lost
the
summons
power,
the
commissioner
must
in
effect
close
down
or
suspend
the
civil
audit
because
he
has
no
way
of
getting
information
from
the
taxpayer.
but,
apart
from
these
practical
problems,
the
commissioner
has
long
had
a
policy
of
suspending
civil
audit
pending
the
completion
of
criminal
proceedings.
this
policy
is
set
forth
in
the
internal
revenue
manual
and
it
stems
from
the
difficulty
of
conducting
at
the
same
time
a
civil
tax
fraud
litigation
while
a
criminal
tax
fraud
investigation
is
continuing.
and,
the
most
obvious
problem,
of
course,
is
the
risk
of
killing
the
criminal
case
by
making
a
premature
disclosure
of
evidence
to
the
potential
defendant.
if
the
three-year
rule
is
held
to
apply
here,
the
commissioner,
right
in
the
middle
of
his
criminal
tax
fraud
investigation,
is
going
to
have
to
send
a
notice
of
deficiency
to
the
taxpayer
asserting
civil
tax
fraud.
the
taxpayer
will
then
go
into
tax
court
or
the
district
court
and
the
commissioner
will
be
required
by
the
rules
of
those
courts
to
allege
fraud
affirmatively
in
the
answer
and
then
be
subject
to
discovery,
interrogatories
and
depositions,
about
his
fraud
theory.
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
if
the
commissioner
is
required
to
open
up
his
files
right
in
the
middle
of
the
on-going
criminal
investigation,
laying
out
his
theory
of
fraud
and
the
fact
he
expects
to
rely
on
in
proving
fraud,
that
criminal
case
could
probably
be
killed.
beyond
that,
we
think
there
are
other
problems
in
maintaining
an
on-going
criminal
investigation
and
a
parallel
civil
tax
fraud
litigation.
in
the
civil
case,
the
taxpayer,
for
example,
will
probably
assert
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
barring
any
introduction
of
evidence
on
the
issue
of
fraud.
there
could
be
problems
with
witnesses
because
of
the
premature
disclosure
of
their
names
through
potential
defendant
and
finally
there
can
be
problems
where
the
taxpayer
puts
up
a
defense
as
a
beleaguered
defendant
in
a
criminal
action
asserting
the
commissioner
is
trying
to
dun
him
on
five
different
fronts
at
once,
grab
his
money,
and
juries
occasionally
have
been
persuaded
by
that
kind
of
evidence.
so,
for
all
these
reasons,
we
think
that
the
commissioner's
policy
of
suspending
civil
tax
audit
until
the
completion
of
criminal
proceedings
is
salutary
both
on
grounds
of
fairness
to
the
taxpayer
and
on
grounds
of
sensible
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
petitioners'
argument
here
would
effectively
kill
that
policy.
and,
finally,
we
think
there
is
one
last
reason
for
tax
policy
that
counsels
in
favor
of
a
plain
reading
of
the
code
here.
and
this
has
to
do
with
the
commissioner's
overall
duties
to
enforce
the
tax
laws.
tax
laws
are
complicated.
taxpayers
are
well
advised
and
sometimes
devious
and
the
commissioner
has
limited
resources.
every
year
about
two
million
amended
returns
are
filed.
we
think
it
would
be
a
very
bad
idea
to
let
amended
returns
to
become
yet
another
tool
in
the
hands
of
people
trying
to
evade
the
tax
laws
which
they
could
use
to
manipulate
the
limitations
period
to
their
own
advantage,
depending
on
how,
what,
and
when
they
file.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
think
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
