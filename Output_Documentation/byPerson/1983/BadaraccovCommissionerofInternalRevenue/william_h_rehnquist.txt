by
failing
to
fraudulently
file
a
tax
return?
justice

rehnquist
isn't
there
a
difference
between
failing
to
fraudulently
file
and
fraudulently
failing
to
file?
i
mean,
failing
to
fraudulently
file
to
me
means--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
you
had
planned
to
file
a
fraudulent
report,
but
you
didn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
that
is
the
rule,
mr.
fredericks,
i
suppose
the
taxpayer
has
it
within
his
control
to
avoid
that
abuse
by
simply
not
filing
an
amended
return
after
he
has
filed
a
fraudulent
return.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
he
presumably
took
that
risk
in
the
first
instance
when
he
filed
the
fraudulent
return.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
true
of
almost
anybody
who
commits
fraud
in
all
of
the
variety
of
ways
that
fraud
is
prohibited,
isn't
it?
that
once
they
have
committed
the
fraud,
they
have
committed
an
act
which
submits
them
to
rather
extensive
liability
and
there
is
very
little
way
to
recover
from
that.
