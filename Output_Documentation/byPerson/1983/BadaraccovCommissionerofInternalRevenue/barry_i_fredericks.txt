mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
comes
to
the
court
from
an
appeal
from
the
third
circuit.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
basically
it
is
a
simple
legal
issue
that
is
presented
here
today.
simply
put
the
question
is
one
of
whether
an
individual
who
has
initially
filed
a
fraudulent
tax
return
and
subsequently
comes
forth
and
files
an
amended
tax
return,
whether
by
that
act
he
begins
the
running
of
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
applicable
under
the
internal
revenue
code
or,
as
the
government
alleges,
he
is
forever
open
to
an
assessment
of
tax
upon
the
filing
of
the
initial
fraudulent
return.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
think,
your
honor,
under
that
point
the
government
could
argue
that
there
was
no
amended
return
filed
and
i
think
that
we
would
be
in
a
very
difficult
position
to
start
the
running
of
the
amended
return,
the
government
could
then
say
the
amended
return
is
not
filed.
in
this
case
and
the
cases
that
have
taken
place
in
the
second,
fifth,
and
tenth
circuits
that
is
not
the
facts
that
we
have
to
deal
with,
in
fact,
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
amended
return
was
taken
and
the
tax
that
was
due
on
the
ammended
return
was
collected
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
well--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--i
think
that
the
issue
of
the
ammended
return
is
one
that
the
government
presses
which
i
have
always
thought
has
been
a
question
of
an
ostrich
type
argument
in
so
far
as
they
can
deny
the
existence
of
an
ammended
return
except
that
the
internal
revenue
code
at
length
refers
to
ammended
returns
and
is
a
practice
that
has
been
going
on
for
some
time
and
has
been
recognized
by
the
courts
and
in
many
cases
has
been
used
by
the
government
in
connection
with
their
criminal
prosecutions
of
the
people
who
have
been
filing
fraudulent
tax
returns
in
the
first
instance.
the
dowell
case
and
the
klemp
case,
i
believe,
in
both
instances
the
government
used
the
ammended
return
as
part
of
their
case
in
chief
to
establish
the
question
of
fraud.
i
think
the
question
the
chief
judge
poses
is
an
interesting
one.
i
really
can't
answer
the
question
of
what
would
happen
if
the
government
refused
to
accept
that
amended
return,
which
they
may
or
may
not
have
a
right
to
do.
but,
in
this
case
and
in
the
cases
that
have
the
issue
as
has
been
presented
that
has
not
been
the
situation.
the
amended
return
has
been
fully
accepted
by
the
government.
and,
we
suggest
that
upon
the
filing
of
that
amended
return
that
the
tax
court
ruling
in
bennett,
which
was
decided
in
1958,
and
acquiesced
in
by
the
united
states
government,
which
was
a
case
of
the
fraudulent
failure
to
file
a
tax
return
at
all
and
a
criminal
prosecution
of
that
taxpayer
for
fraudulently
failing
to
file.
in
a
subsequent
filing
of
a
non-fraudulent
return,
the
tax
court
and
the
government
concluded
that
at
that
point
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
provided
in
6501(a)
began
to
run.
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
basis
to
distinguish
that
case
from
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
respectfully--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--no.
i
think
the
subsection
language
is
not
different,
your
honor.
the
subsection
language,
(c)(3)
and
(c)(1),
are
identical.
they
both
provide
that
the
statute
shall
not
run--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--is
the
initial
language
in
the
first
section
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
and,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
one
must
go
back
to
1918
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted
and
at
that
time
congress
provided
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations
and
an
exemption
in
the
case
of
filing
a
fraudulent
tax
return.
no
mention
was
made
at
all
on
failure
to
file.
in
1921,
congress
then
enacted
what
is
now
the
predecessor
of
the
sections
we
are
dealing
with.
and,
it
said
the
fraudulent
failure
to
file
or...
i
am
sorry,
the
filing
of
a
fraudulent
return
or
the
failure
to
file
in
a
single
sentence.
and,
i
suggest
that
that
indicated
an
intention
by
congress
to
deal
with
these
two
situations
identically.
in
fact,
all
of
the
circuit
courts
that
have
considered
this
matter
have
all
concluded
that
the
two
sections
must
be
read
in
pari
materia.
i
don't
think
that
is
in
question
here.
it
is
only
in
1954
when
the
'54
code
comes
into
being
that
the
two
section,
which
were
in
one
sentence,
were
split
into
two
sections.
and,
there
is
no
substantial
legislative
history
one
way
or
the
other
to
indicate
why.
i
suggest
that
the
legislative
history,
which
indicates
that
both
of
these
sections
were
to
be
identically
when
they
were
initially
enacted,
indicates
there
should
be
identical
treatment.
therefore,
when
one
fraudulently
seeks
to
evade
the
tax
law
by
failing
to
fraudulently
file
a
tax
return--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--well,
that
is
what
the
facts
were
in
bennett.
the
taxpayer,
with
an
intent
to
evade
the
tax,
filed
a
return.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
no,
no,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
am
sorry.
what
the
bennett
taxpayer
did
was
with
the
intent
to
evade
the
tax,
with
the
fraudulent
intent
failed
to
file
the
return.
what
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
did
was
file
the
fraudulently
return
and
subsequently
filed
an
amended
return.
i
suggest--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--which
begins
to
run
from
the
day
that
return
is
filed
irrespective
of
whatever
transpires,
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
that
is
not
true
at
all,
because
if
you
filed
and
it
was
fraudulent
you
have
two
other
things,
three
things
that
have
to
come
into
play.
one,
that
you
would
be
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
you
would
have
six
years
in
which
the
government
could
indict
you
and
try
you.
two,
you
would
be
subject
to
the
50
percent
penalty.
and,
three,
in
order
to
have
a
statute
of
limitations
to
begin
at
all,
you
would
have
had
to
have
filed
an
amended
return.
yes,
if
the
fraudulent
return
was
filed
on
april
15th
and
the
amended
return
was
filed
on
april
16th,
now
in
that
case
there
is
no
running
of
a
statute
from
our
position.
the
16th
for
three
years
would
begin
to
run.
that
taxpayer
might
be
in
better
position
than
the
fellow
who
negligently
forgot
his
25
percent,
but
that
taxpayer
came
in
immediately,
rectified
his
situation,
and
gave
the
government
the
information
it
had.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
suggest
not
for
this
reason.
congress...
there
is
some
legislative
history
on
the
six-year...
the
reason
for
the
six-year
statute
of
limitations
and
that
was
that
begins
to
run
from
the
day
it
is
filed
whether
the
government
discovers
it
or
not.
so,
the
government,
without
having
the
benefit
of
the
information,
has
got
a
six-year
statute
running
on
it
and,
therefore,
congress
said
we
are
going
to
give
them
additional
time
to
catch
up
this
possible
mistake
if
it
was
negligent.
obviously,
if
it
is
fraudulent,
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
of
any
kind.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
the
statute
of
limitations
on
that
is
six
years.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
the
court's
ruling
is
that
since
it
is
a
running
statute
that
no
act,
be
it
either--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--i
think
not.
i
think
not,
because
the
statute
is
already
running.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
statute
running.
we
are
saying,
as
in
bennett,
where
the
filing
of
what
the
government
characterizes
as
a
delinquent
return
now
starts
the
statute.
so,
in
my
case,
the
filing
of
the
amended
return
starts
the
statute.
in
the
25
percent
case,
that
statute
begins
to
run
the
day
the
return
is
filed,
whether
the
government
discovers
it
or
doesn't
discover
it,
no
matter
what
happens,
and
neither
the
taxpayer
nor
the
government
can
stay
off
the
running
of
that
statute.
in
our
case,
the
government's
position
is
that
they
have
forever,
literally
forever,
because
if
you
buy
the
government's
position,
the
taxpayer
can
have
died,
his
estate
could
have
been
passed
on
to
three
generations
and
still
the
statute
of
limitations
on
transferees
don't
begin
to
run
until
one
year
after
the
initial
statute
would
begin
to
run.
the
government
can
go
on
down
three
generations
to
assess
this
tax
if
they
so
choose.
the
other
problem
that
we
suggest
exists
is
that
by
not
having
a
statute
of
limitations
of
any
kind
the
government
is
in
a
situation
where
they
can
come
in
after
the
amended
tax
return
has
been
filed
and
make
numerous
denials
of
deductions
claimed
by
the
taxpayer
and
then
that
burden
shifts
to
the
taxpayer,
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
situation.
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
establishing
the
propriety
of
certain
deductions
that
he
has
made.
having
now
been
ten
years
down
the
road
we
run
into
the
very
reason
that
this
court
says
that
statute
of
limitations
exist
so
that
no
issue
shall
be
tried
at
a
time
when
evidence
disappears,
memories
fade,
and
witnesses
are
not
available.
to
give
the
government
an
open-ended
position
after
the
amended
return
comes
in,
we
suggest
opens
up
a
substantial
area
of
government
abuse
and
we
suggest
that
when
the
government
says--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--well,
by
not
filing
the
amended
and
taking
the
risk
of
non-disclosure.
he
could
just
sit
back
and
hope
the
government
never
catches
him.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
well,
that
comes
another
way
around.
since
our
policy
for
taxation
is
really
based,
as
this
court
has
said
many
times,
upon
the
voluntary
assessment
of
the
taxpayer
of
his
tax,
and
in
this
case,
a
reassessment,
we
suggest,
that
i
think
your
question
highlights
very
nicely,
that
to
take
the
government's
position
puts
a
premium
on
silence.
it
says
to
the
taxpayer,
don't
file
the
amended
return
because
you
have
no
benefit.
if
anything,
you
are
going
to
make
an
admission
against
your
own
interest,
subject
yourself
to
the
50
percent
fraud
penalties,
and
possibly
criminal
prosecution.
sit
back
and
run
the
risk
of
not
being
disclosed,
and,
therefore,
you
have
no
problem.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
only
if
the
government
discovers
you.
and,
we
suggest
that
one
of
the
ways
to
recover
it
and
not
to
avoid...
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
penalties
change.
we
are
suggesting
that
by
filing
the
amended
return,
yes,
you
are
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
yes,
you
are
subject
to
the
tax
penalty.
but,
no,
you
should
not
be
subject
to
an
open-ended
statute
of
limitations.
you
have
come
forth
and
filed
an
amended
return.
you
have
given
the
government
all
of
the
information
they
need
on
the
civil
side
to
determine
what
the
tax
is
and
there
is
no
justification
at
that
point
for
allowing
the
government
to
sit
back,
armed
with
the
information
necessary
to
determine
the
tax,
to
allow
them
to
sit
back
ad
infinitum.
here
is
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
has
come
forward
and
filed
his
amended
return.
he
has
given
them
the
information
requested
and
there
is
no
justification
for
the
open-ended
statute
of
limitations
suggested
by
the
government.
now,
they
still
have
their
criminal
remedy.
we
are
not
suggesting
for
one
moment
that
the
filing
of
the
amended
tax
return
deprives
the
government
of
its
right
to
prosecute
the
individual
criminally
or
to
impose
its
civil
50
percent
penalty.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
filing
of
the
amended
return,
as
in
the
case
of
bennett,
the
filing
of
what
the
government
called
a
delinquent
return,
should
prevent
the
government
from
sitting
on
their
hands
forever
and
a
day
until
they
decide
they
want
to
take
action,
particularly
when
that
delay
results
in
substantial
prejudice
to
this
taxpayer
who
has
now
gone
through
a
self-assessment
and
has
filed
his
return.
there
is
no
government
policy
that
warrants
such
an
open-ended
civil
statute
of
limitations.
the
government
disagrees.
it
says,
well,
it
needs
this
in
order
to
allow
them
to
proceed
with
their
criminal
investigation.
we
suggest
that
that
is
really
not
the
case.
certainly
the
criminal
investigation,
at
the
time
that
the
government
has
referred
the
matter
to
the
department
of
justice
for
criminal
investigation,
they
will
have
gathered
enough
information
to
meet
the
civil
burden
which
is
far
less
than
their
criminal
burden.
secondly,
the
amended
return
gives
the
government
one
advantage.
it
has
an
admission
against
interest
by
the
would-be
defendant
to
which
they
can
compare
with
the
original
return
and
clearly
determine
right
from
the
face
of
the
amended
return
where
the
fraud
was
and
in
what
directions
they
have
to
go.
at
the
time
that
the
government
seeks
an
indictment,
it
certainly
has
a
more
than
prima
facie
case.
the
government
believes
at
the
time
it
returns
an
indictment
against
a
citizens
that
it
can
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
burden
on
the
civil
side
is
substantially
less
than
that.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
the
initial...
badaracco
was,
in
fact,
indicted
and
plead
guilty.
deleet
was
not.
deleet
is
not
a
criminal
case
and
there
has
been
no
criminal
prosecution
against
deleet.
deleet
was
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer,
which
is
a
corporation,
had
a
change
in
the
upper
echelons
of
management
and
they
came
forth
and
filed
their
amended
returns.
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution
in
that
regard.
but
the
point
that
we
are
making
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
the
government
to
sit
back
and
wait
on
these
type
of
situations,
particularly
when
armed
with
the
amended
return.
they
have
used
the
return
in
criminal
prosecutions
against
the
taxpayer.
and,
to
allow
them
on
the
civil
side
to
wait
when
it
is
clearly
going
to
prejudice
the
taxpayer,
we
suggest
is
illogical
and
unconscionable.
i
mean,
bennett
was
a
classic
case
of
a
criminal
who
was
indicted,
who
had
committed
tax
fraud,
and
the
court
said,
well,
once
you
filed
a
return
and
have
given
the
government
the
very
information
it
needs
to
apply
the
tax,
there
is
no
reason
to
keep
the
statute
of
limitations
open.
might
i
also
add
the
bennett
case
also
dealt
the
amended
return,
yes,
you
are
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
yes,
you
are
subject
to
the
tax
penalty.
but,
no,
you
should
not
be
subject
to
an
open-ended
statute
of
limitations.
you
have
come
forth
and
filed
an
amended
return.
you
have
given
the
government
all
of
the
information
they
need
on
the
civil
side
to
determine
what
the
tax
is
and
there
is
no
justification
at
that
point
for
allowing
the
government
to
sit
back,
armed
with
the
information
necessary
to
determine
the
tax,
to
allow
them
to
sit
back
ad
infinitum.
here
is
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
has
come
forward
and
filed
his
amended
return.
he
has
given
them
the
information
requested
and
there
is
no
justification
for
the
open-ended
statute
of
limitations
suggested
by
the
government.
now,
they
still
have
their
criminal
remedy.
we
are
not
suggesting
for
one
moment
that
the
filing
of
the
amended
tax
return
deprives
the
government
of
its
right
to
prosecute
the
individual
criminally
or
to
impose
its
civil
50
percent
penalty.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
the
filing
of
the
amended
return,
as
in
the
case
of
bennett,
the
filing
of
what
the
government
called
a
delinquent
return,
should
prevent
the
government
from
sitting
on
their
hands
forever
and
a
day
until
they
decide
they
want
to
take
action,--
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
that
case
that
is
supported
in
either
logic
or
law
to
say
that
a
fraudulent
filer
who
files
an
amended
return
shouldn't
be
treated
in
the
same
light
and
under
the
same
circumstances.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
policy
considerations
rendered
by
the
government.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
to
the
contrary.
i
suggest
to
have
a
distinction
drawn
on
the
filing
of
a
piece
of
paper
moves
away
from
the
question
of
intent
which
is
what
these
sections
were
to
get
to.
the
question
of
intent
was
the
underlying
basis
here
in
both
bennett
and
these
sections,
fraudulent
intent.
once
that
is
dissipated
and
the
taxpayer
comes
in
and
either
files
what
is
known
as
the
delinquent
return
or
the
amended
return--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--yes,
but
the...
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
the
at
the
point
the
taxpayer
files
his
amended
return,
he
has
obviously
abandoned
his
initial
intent.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
no.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
yes,
i
acknowledge
that,
but
at
the
time
he
has
filed
the
amended
return,
he
has
come
forth
and
met
his
obligation
as
a
taxpayer
to
give
the
government
all
of
the
information.
if
one
would
say
he
has
abandoned
his
sins
of
yesterday,
he
has--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--but,
it
doesn't
remove
the
penalties
either,
your
honor.
the
criminal
sanctions
are
still
there,
the
50
percent
fraud
penalty
is
still
there.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
it
should
end
the
government's
open-ended
statute
of
limitations
so
that
the
government--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--sitting
back
and
waiting--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--assess
the
tax.
all
we
are
asking--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--they
waited
six
and
a
half
years
to
come
in
and
assess
the
taxes.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
well,
they
denied
certain
of
the
business
deductions
in
question
as
to
deleet
and
they
attempted
to
impose
the
tax
fraud
penalty
in
badaracco.
they
attempted
to--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--no,
i
didn't.
i
said--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--no.
i
said
the
filing
of
the
amended
return
does
not
relieve
the
taxpayer
of
his
exposure
to
that
fraud
penalty.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
exact
ruling
in
bennett
and
that
is
the
ruling
that
the
government
has
acquiesced
in
and
has
put
forth
in
their
own
regulation.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
said
they
have
three
years
from
the
filing
of
the
amended
return.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
because
it
is
the
amended
return
that
has
given
them
the
knowledge
and
information
that
they
need
to
assess
the
tax.
the
fraud
penalty,
as
set
up
by
congress,
is
not
a
penalty
as
such,
it
is
a
right
to
impose
additional
tax.
the
way
the
statute
is
worded
it
is
not
that
there
is
a
penalty,
it
is
in
computating
the
additional
tax
due
the
government
has
a
right
to
add
50
percent.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
right.
and,
it
must
be
imposed
with
the
tax
itself.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
that
is
the
position
that
we
take,
your
honor.
and,
that
was
the
exact
position
that
was
taken
by
the
court
in
bennett,
exactly
the
question
in
bennett
where--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--that
was
the
position
that
the
tenth
circuit
took
in
dowell.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
well,
i
don't
want
to
abandon
it
since
the
dowell
decision
was
favorable
to
me.
i
think
that
there
is
much...
a
good
point
can
be
made
that
the
amended
return
is
a
return.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
think
we
do
except--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--well,
the
reason
i
don't
make
the
argument
is
the
problem
that
one
comes
into...
again,
i
am
not
abandoning
the
argument.
i
don't
think...
it
is
not
the
best
argument
we
could
have
made.
i
think
bennett
is
more
dispositive
since
that
is
a
case
that
the
government
has
agreed
to
and
has
passed
a
revenue
ruling
and
were
identical.
but
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
the
government
will
argue
that
the
return
is
the
original
return
which
was
fraudulently
filed.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
that
is
correct.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
it
is
my
argument
based
upon
bennett.
i
accept
that
as
my
argument
based
upon
bennett
because
bennett
has
decided
the
prior
situation
of
the
failure
to
file
and
if
you
analogize
that
the
fraudulent
return
is
not
a
return,
then
you
fail
to
file,
and
once
you
file
the
amended
return
you
are
right
within
the
square
corners
of
bennett.
and,
to
that
extent--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--well--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--well,
i
think
that,
your
honor--
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
--no.
i
adopt
the
argument
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
that
was
the
argument
that
they
made
in
their
opinion;
that
the
return,
the
initial
return
was
not
a
zellerbach
return,
it
wasn't
an
honest
evidence
to
file
a
return
and
it
was
the
amended
return
that
was,
in
fact,
the
first
return
filed.
i
suggest
that
is
in
keeping
with
the
position
we
have
taken
in
bennett
and
which
the
government
has
acquiesced
and
the
logic
of
bennett
carries
right
through
to
that
direction.
but,
i
certainly
suggest
that
a
return,
an
amended
return
can
be
reviewed
as
a
return
under
the
statute
and
then
within
the
arguments
of
6501(a)
as
taking
this
out
of
the
exceptions
that
follow.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
yes,
i
do,
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
i
would
like
to
just
respond
to
one
question
that
justice
white
asked
about
the
imposition
of
the
fraud
penalty
and
i
read
from
the
government's
revenue
ruling
that
i
referred
to
earlier.
i
think
the
government's
position
is
very
simple.
the
imposition
of
a
civil
fraud
penalty
under
section
6635(b)
of
the
code
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
the
tax
can
be
assessed
at
any
time
under
section
6501(c)
even
though
the
taxpayer
was
subject
to
the
penalty
for
underpayment
due
to
fraud.
it
goes
on
to
hold
that
that
must
be
done
within
three
years
of...
that
was
the
bennett
case
they
were
referring
to,
but
within
three
years
of
the
filing
of
the
delinquent
return.
judge
stevens,
your
question
concerning
the
original
return
which
was
subsequently
modified
by
the
amended
return,
that
case,
i
believe,
was
decided
in
the
tenth
circuit,
alkire
versus
nicholas,
and
in
that
case
the
court
held
that
it
was
the
amended
return
since
the
original
return
was
insufficient;
that
the
amended
return
was
the
return
that
started
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
have
cited
that
case
in
both
the
badaracco
brief
and
ours.
but,
it
was
not
as
the
government
had
indicated
on
that.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
well,
i
am
just
citing
the
case
and
giving
your
honor
the
authority
for
it.
mr.
barry
i.
fredericks
on
the
question
of
minimal
tax
fraud
questions,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
minimal
return.
if
a
return
is
fraudulent
in
any
degree,
it
is
deemed
by
the
government
to
be
totally
fraudulent
irrespective
of
the
amount,
irrespective
of
the
issue,
and,
therefore,
would
be
subject
to
this
open-ended
statute
of
limitations
urged
by
the
government.
i
suggest
that
the
government's
tax
policies
are
not
well
taken
and
we
have
covered
each
of
them
in
our
briefs.
but,
the
point
at
hand
is
the
government
has
several
ways
of
avoiding
this
problem.
one,
as
the
chief
justice
raised
when
they
initially
stepped
to
the
podium,
and
that
is
don't
accept
the
amended
return.
two,
the
government
can
say,
taxpayer,
your
time
is
about
to
run
out,
extend
the
statute
of
limitations.
they
do
it
all
the
time
on
a
regular
basis.
three,
simply
take
your
figures
and
assess
the
tax.
this
is
not
an
attempt
in
any
way
to
inhibit
the
government's
criminal
investigation.
it
is
not
in
any
way
inhibited
to
avoid
penalties.
it
is
designed
to
say
that
a
taxpayer
who
has
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
and
has
filed
an
amended
return
shouldn't
be
open
to
a
statute
of
limitations
that
runs
forever
and
the
government
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
sit
back
and
wait
10,
15,
20,
30
years
and
then
come
in
and
deny
certain
deductions
that
the
taxpayer
has
made
which
places
the
burden
on
the
taxpayer
to
prove
the
validity
of
those
deductions.
we
suggest
that
the
position
in
bennett
acquiesced
in
by
the
government
is
identical
here;
that
the
policy
considerations
are,
in
fact,
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer;
that
nothing
we
are
requesting
strains
or
prevents
the
government
from
enforcing
the
tax
laws,
and
for
those
reasons
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts
be
reinstated.
thank
you
all.
