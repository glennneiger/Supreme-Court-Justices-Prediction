unknown
speaker
has
there
been
any
indictment
against
either
of
these
taxpayers?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
fraudulent
intent
is
dissipated
by
the
filing
of
an
amended
return?
certainly
if
the
return
was
fraudulent
at
the
time
it
was
filed,
it
is
nonetheless
fraudulent
by
virtue
of
an
amended
return
being
filed
later,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
have
to
a
permanent
intention
to
commit
fraud.
unknown
speaker
all
you
need
is
at
the
time
you
commit
it.
no,
the
attempt
to
escape
punishment.
that
is
what--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
remove
the
fact
that
he
has
committed
fraud.
unknown
speaker
and
prevent
them
from
doing
what?
unknown
speaker
before
they
do
what?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
try
to
do
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
did
they
try
to
assess?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am...
did
you
say
that
you
could
forever
impose
the
50
percent
fraud
penalty?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
did.
unknown
speaker
but
only
for
three
years.
unknown
speaker
the
amended
return
is
filed
and
the
very
next
day
the
government
goes
back
and
assesses
the...
more
than
three
years
after
the
original
failure
to
file
or...
they
go
back
the
next
day
after
the
amended
return
and
impose
the
fraud
penalties.
now
you
say
that
is
all
right.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
do.
why
do
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
it
is
still
a
fraud
penalty,
isn't
it,
for
committing
fraud?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
say
you
can
do
that
for
three
years
after
filing
the
amended
return.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
language
of
the
statute?
are
you
arguing,
just
so
i
get
your
argument
clear,
that
within
the
meaning
of
section
6501(a)
that
the
amended
return
is
"a
return"?
unknown
speaker
i
just
wonder
if
you
are
taking
that
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is,
then
don't
you
just
win
from
the
plain
language
of
6501(a)?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
don't
make
that
argument.
that
is
why
i
am
kind
of
puzzled.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the...
i
don't...
i
understand
what
they
can
argue,
but
you
argue
going
back
to
these
early
statutes
that
a
fraudulent
return
is
not
a
return.
unknown
speaker
just
as
no
return
at
all
was.
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
don't
you
say
as
soon
as
they
file
an
amended
return
they
have
now
filed
a
statutory
return
and
the
statute
begins
to
run?
why
isn't
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
don't
argue
you
are
within
the
square
corners
of
what
congress
has
said
the
correct
rule
should
be.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
would
be
more
interested
in
the
language
of
the
statute
than
in
sort
of
a
convoluted
reasoning
from
a
bunch
of
cases.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
don't
make
the
argument
in
any
event?
unknown
speaker
let
me
stop
you
right
there.
why
are
you
so
sure
of
that?
couldn't
one
say
that
the
amended
return
is
a
return
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
only
statutory
return
then.
couldn't
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
question
and
i
won't
interrupt
any
more.
in
your
view,
is
an
amended
return
a
return
within
the
meaning
of
the
code?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
the
return.
right.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
argument
would
fall
if
instead
of
the
word
6501(a),
that
congress
had
selected
the
word
"a".
unknown
speaker
but,
it
wouldn't
be
quite
as
clear.
unknown
speaker
you
place
a
lot
of
weight
on
"the".
unknown
speaker
it
just
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
you
got
your
information
that
a
fraud
had
been
committed.
you
may
have
gotten
it
from
an
amended
return.
unknown
speaker
in
assessing
any
additional
taxes
in
either
one
of
these
cases,
is
there
additional
taxes
assessed
after
the
filing
of
the
amended
return
other
than
the
fraud
penalty?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
accept
the
accuracy
of
the
amended
return?
unknown
speaker
because
you
couldn't
really,
after
three
year,
have
assessed
any
additional
taxes
on
the
amended
return,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
there
may
be...
you
might
be
able
to
impose
the
fraud
penalty
but
could
you...
say
you
made
a
mistake
in
calculating
your
tax
on
the
amended
return
other
than
the
fraud
penalty.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
do
that
after
three
years
from
the
amended
return?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
arguably
at
least
there
could
be
a
difference
between
assessing
more
taxes
than
shown
on
the
amended
return
and
assessing
some
penalty
for
the
fraud
that
was
committed
prior.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
hadn't
attempted
to
impose
any
fraud
penalty
at
all.
you
just
said
your
amended
return
doesn't
accurately
state
your
taxes,
so
we
are
assessing
additional
taxes.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
did
it
more
than
three
years
after
the
filing
of
the
amended
return.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
i
would
tell
you
again.
suppose
you
do
two
things
more
than
three
years
after
the
amended
return
is
filed.
one,
you
say
you
didn't
state
your
taxes
correctly,
wholly
aside
form
there
being
any
fraud.
unknown
speaker
no,
we
just
say...
you
do
two
things.
you
say
you
failed
to
state
your
basic
tax
accurately
in
your
amended
return.
also,
we
are
assessing
a
fraud
penalty.
now,
you
say
you
can
do
both
of
those.
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
of
the
original
return
though.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
say
that
even
at
the
time
of
filing
the
amended
return
the
taxpayer
voluntarily
pays
the
fraud
penalty.
you
would
still
say
you
can
go
on
forever.
unknown
speaker
he
first
filed
a
fraudulent
return.
unknown
speaker
and
six
months
later
he
files
an
accurate
amended
return
and
voluntarily
tenders
the
fraud
penalty.
unknown
speaker
suppose--
--he
thinks
it
is
accurate
but,
you
know,
ten
years
later
decide
he
overdeducted
something
like
his
automobile
expense.
unknown
speaker
he
said
the
fraud
penalty
only
gave
half
a
million
where
he
should
have
given
an
extra
$500
say.
what
i
am
saying
is
he
substantially
paid
it.
you
would
still
say
that
you
go
on
forever.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
to
prevent
a
taxpayer
from
filing
his
initial
return
and
then
an
amended
return
and
then
a
second
amended
return?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
matter
of
grace
whether
it
will
be
accepted.
unknown
speaker
now,
suppose
he
put
out
a
fraudulent
return
initially,
as
you
claim
here,
a
less
fraudulent
or
correct
return
the
second
time,
and
still
a
fraudulent
one
later,
the
third
one.
what
is
the
starting
date
then?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
i
said
i
wouldn't,
but
i...
say
you
file
an
original
return
that
is
valid,
you
think
it
is
valid,
but
you
forgot
something,
so
a
year
later
you
file
an
amended
return
correcting
a
mistake.
unknown
speaker
not
fraudulent,
but
just
inaccurate.
what
period
of
time
does
the
government
have
in
which
to...
when
does
the
three
years--
unknown
speaker
--so,
if
the
government
accepts
an
amended
return
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
original
one,
why--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
lauber,
may
i
ask
you
whether
fraud
is
easier
to
detect
or
to
prove
in
the
bennett
situation
than
in
the
situation
involved
in
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the...
what
element
is
fraudulent
failure
to
file
have
in
it
that
a
willful
fail
to
file
doesn't?
unknown
speaker
but,
fraud
connotes
intention
to
deceive,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
government
disagrees
with
you
on
that
though?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
