mr.
fredericks,
can
i
ask
on
that
point,
what
is
the
law
with
respect
to
this
situation?
suppose
you
negligently
file
a
return
with
more
than
a
25
percent...
you
have
got
six
years.
then
six
months
later
you
file
a
correct
amended
return.
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
still
six
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
holdings
are
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
position
then.
