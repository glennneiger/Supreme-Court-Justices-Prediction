well,
mr.
fredericks,
the
language
of
the
two
subsections
is
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
case
of
the
original
non-filing
of
a
return,
the
section
says
within
three
years
after
the
return
is
filed.
there
is
language
that
doesn't
appear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
language
in
6501(a)
does
say
that
the
tax
will
be
assessed
within
three
years
after
the
return
is
filed,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
language
would
then
apply
where
there
is
originally
no
return
filed,
but
later
one
is
filed.
now,
i
don't
see
how,
when
you
compare
that
with
the
language
for
the
fraudulent
return
that
is
filed
and
subsequently
an
honest
return
filed,
the
language
is
so
different
that
i
don't
see
how
you
can
make
the
argument
you
are
making.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
if
a
taxpayer
simply
negligently,
not
fraudulently,
failed
to
include
more
than
25
percent
of
the
income,
then
there
is
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
under
you
theory,
you
would
be
better
off
if
you
had
a
fraudulently
intent
than
a
negligent
intent
because
then
it
would
just
be
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
that
difference
and
the
fact
that
the
congress
treated
the
negligent
omission
differently
does
give
some
meaning
to
the
language
that
i
referred
to
early.
i
mean,
the
scheme
holds
together
a
little
better,
doesn't
it,
if
that
is
the
case?
