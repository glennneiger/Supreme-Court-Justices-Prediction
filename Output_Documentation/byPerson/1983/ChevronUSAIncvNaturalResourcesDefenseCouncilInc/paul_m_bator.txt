mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
an
important
regulation
issued
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
under
the
clean
air
act
amendments
of
1977.
the
regulation
addresses
the
question
of
what
counts
as
a
"source"
for
purposes
of
activating
a
permit
program
called
the
new
source
review
program.
under
the
statute,
the
states
must
impose
new
source
review
in
certain
areas
of
the
country
in
situations
where
construction
or
modification
of
a
major
stationary
source
of
air
pollution
would
lead
to
significant
emissions
increases,
and
the
question
is:
what
is
a
source?
the
regulation
at
issue
allows
the
states...
it
doesn't
compel
them...
it
allows
them
to
adopt
a
plant-wide
definition
of
the
term
"source".
this
is
sometimes
called
the
bubble
definition.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
bubble
definition
is
unlawful;
that
the
administrator
has
no
discretion
in
how
to
define
"source";
that
the
statute
compels
one
rigid
definition;
and
we
are
here
asking
this
court
to
correct
that
holding
and
to
hold
that
the
regulation
and
the
definition
fell
within
the
lawful
discretion
of
the
administrator.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
believe
so.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
seem
to
be
worried
about
the
fact--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
the
agency
has
in
fact
exercised
its
discretion
in
a
number
of
different--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--with
a
number
of
different
resolutions
of
the
problem
from
time
to
time.
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act,
i
want
to
give
a
little
bit
of
background
here
to
the
statutory
structure.
they
comprise
part
d
of
the
act,
and
they
were
passed
in
'77
to
regulate
so-called
1977
met
the
original
deadlines
for
attaining
national
air
quality
standards.
for
these
areas,
the
congress
in
'77
adopted
a
rather
elaborately
calibrated
set
of
requirements
which
were
designed
to
achieve
three
overall
goals:
one
was
to
assure
steady
progress
toward
attainment;
second,
to
encourage
economic
growth
through
the
creation
of
new
plant
and
equipment
even
during
this
period
of
movement
toward
attainment;
and
third,
to
assure
that
states
should
have
increased
flexibility
in
organizing
their
own
antipollution
strategies.
these
were
the
three
central
animating
conceptions.
now
part
d
is
comprised
of
a
complex
of
provisions.
the
centerpiece
is
the
obligation
on
the
state
to
create
new
state
implementation
plans.
these
are
the
things
called
sips>
["],
and
these
must
require
annual
incremental
reductions
in
emissions
which
constitute
reasonable
further
progress
towards
attainment.
the
statute
also
requires
the
sip
to
impose
what
is
called
"reasonably
available
control
technology"
on
all
existing
sources.
these
requirements
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
bubble.
these
are
the
principal
engines
that
are
supposed
to
drive
the
state
toward
attainment.
in
addition,
as
one
element
of
the
scheme,
part
d
creates
the
new
source
performance,
sometimes
called
nsr...
sorry,
new
source
review,
nsr
program.
now
this
imposes
stringent
conditions
before
a
permit
may
be
issued
to
construct
new
sources
of
pollution.
these
conditions
are
very
severe.
for
instance,
one
is
a
requirement
that
so-called
state
of
the
art,
and
therefore
very
expensive,
control
technology
be
installed
on
all
new
sources.
it
is
this
technology
that
in
the
trade
is
sometimes
called
laer,
or
laer
technology.
now
part
d
does
not
itself
define
what
is
a
source
for
purposes
of
activating
this
nsr
program.
in
fact,
the
agency
has
ever
since
1977
assumed
that
it
has
some
discretion
in
how
to
define
what
counts
as
a
source.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
part
d
does
not
define
"source".
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
is
one
of
the
big
disputes
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
whether
that--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--right.
we
say
it
doesn't
apply.
we
say
even
if
it
does,
it
does
not
exclude
the
bubble.
so
we
take
both
positions.
but
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
it
applies--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
definition,
your
honor,
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1970--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--in
section
111
in
the
context
of
a
separate
program
called
the
new
source
performance
standard
program.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we're
saying
that
they
did
not
intend
to
carry
over
or
to
incorporate
the
section
111
definition.
the
section
111
definition
itself
says,
"for
purposes
of
this
section
source
means.
"
the
provisions
which
are
at
issue
here,
which
were
enacted
seven
years
later,
do
not
make
an
explicit
cross-reference
to
section
111.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
not
always,
your
honor,
but
in
this
case
there
is
additional
history,
justice
stevens.
in
this
case
in
the
senate
bill
that
was
before
the
congress
in
both
'76
and
'77,
there
was
an
explicit
cross-reference
to
the
section
111
definition
of
source.
the
conference
committee
removed
that.
in
fact,
the
conference
committee
rejected
the
senate
bill
and
adopted
the
house
approach
to
new
source
review.
the
statute
as
it
was
enacted
did
include
some
explicit
cross-references
to
other
section
111
definitions,
but
not
to
the
definition
of
source.
so
we
look
to
that
history,
and
we
say
there
seems
to
have
been
at
least
some
indication
that
congress
did
not
want
to
tie
the
new
nsr
program
to
that
definition
of
source.
and
that
makes
sense
to
us,
your
honors,
because
the
fact
is
that
the
way
that
definition
works
in
the
1970
nsps
program
would
be
very
different...
that
is,
to
carry
it
over
would
not
make
much
functional
sense,
because
that's
a
very
different
program
and
it
operates
in
a
very
different
way.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
even
if
the
definition
applies,
the
most
sensible
reading
of
it
is
that
within
the
definition
there
is
room
to
adapt
it,
and
that
the
congress
must
have
intended
some
administrative
discretion
to
adapt
it
to
the
functional
needs
of
the
various
clean
air
act
programs.
an
illustration
of
that
would
be,
there
is
still
another
program
enacted
in
1977.
that
was
the
part
c
program
to
prevent
deterioration
of
air
quality
in
areas
of
the
country
which
had
attained
national
standards.
in
that
program
also
the
agency
has
said
that
the
bubble
definition,
even
though
using
the
same
language
as
in
the
section
111
program,
has
in
that
adaptation
used
the
bubble
definition.
and
oddly
enough
in
that
context,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
it
saying
that
there
is
discretion
to
adapt
the
definition
to
meet
the
various
different
substantive
needs
of
the
various
programs.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
reference
to
what
counts
for
purposes
of
the
imposition
of
laer
technology,
which
is
the
latter
example
used,
is
not
meant
to
be
a
definition
of
the
word
"source"
at
all.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
of
course
in
order
to
get
into
laer
it
has
to
be
a
source,
but
once
you
get
to
the
imposition
of
laer
technology
of
course
we
are
there
talking
on
a
unit-by-unit
or
machine
basis
because
that's
what
the
technology
is
imposed
on.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
i
think
that
epa
was
not
purporting
to
create
a
definition
there.
when
we
get
to
the
imposition
of
laer
technology:
the
only
meaningful
use
of
the
word
"source"
is
that
a...
is
the
particular
piece
of
equipment
because
we're
talking
about
technology-forcing
equipment.
so
that
these
are
two
different
contexts
and
two
different
conceptual
universes.
one
is,
when
is
a
whole
administrative
scheme
triggered
at
all?
once
it
is
triggered
and
you
are
in
section
1.73
and
laer
has
to
be
imposed,
it
has
to
be
imposed
on
particular
pieces
of
machinery
and
equipment.
but
it
doesn't
have
much
meaning
to
think
about
laer,
which
is
specific
technology,
in
the
context
of
a
plant.
so
we
don't
think
there
really
is
an
inconsistency,
your
honor,
although
there
may
be
a
verbal
one.
but
we
don't
think
that
they
were
trying
to
define
the
term
laer
requirement
operates.
it's
an
operational
question
in
that
context.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
absolutely.
the
plant-wide
definition
cannot--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--there
are
statutory
definitions
of
what
is
a
new
and
what
is
a
modified
source,
and
they
have
somewhat
different
significance.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
when
a
source
is
new,
the
plant-wide
and
the--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--individual--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--when
you
create
a
new
plant,
then
by
definition
you
have
a
source
because
you
don't
have
an
offset.
that
is,
when
you
build
a
new
plant.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
laer
requirement
insists
that
when
you're
building
a
new
plant,
the
state-of-the-art
technology
be
imposed
on
all
of
the
equipment--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--or
on
sufficient
equipment
within
the
plant
so
that
the...
so
that
the
offset
and
other
requirements
are
met,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
bubble
concept
really
has
operational
significance
only
in
the
context
where
you
have
an
existing
plant.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
believe
that
is
not
so,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
that
is
the
plant...
there
may
be
an
ambiguity
there,
and
i
just
want
to
be
very
sure
to
be
scrupulous.
i
believe
the
requirement
was
that
the
bubble
definition
could
only
be
adopted
by
those
states
that
were
issuing
sips
that
met
all
the
other
requirements
of
the
statute...
that
is,
that
put
down
the
requirements
for
reasonable
further
progress
and
for
the
installation
of
controlling
technology
on
existing
sources.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
may
be
that
they
meant
there
the
use
of
the
bubble
concept
in
the
concept
of
the
moratorium,
which
is
a
slightly
different
context,
and
it
may
be
that
that
is
what
they're
talking
about.
and
there
is
a
use
of
the
bubble
concept
outside
of
the
context
of
an
approved
sip
in
those
states
which
fall
under
the
so-called
construction
moratorium.
i
think
maybe
it
would
be
well
for
me
just
to
say
a
word
about
how
we
think
the
bubble
system
works
as
a
matter
of
the
administrative
technique
that
is
involved.
the
point
of
the
bubble
system
is
that
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
this
complex
of
administrative
requirement
is
triggered,
you
look
at
the
plant
as
a
whole.
and
that
assumes
an
existing
plant.
and
you...
it's
as
if
the
entire
plant
were
encased
in
a
plastic
bubble
with
a
single
emissions
hole
at
the
top.
now
if
you
have
new
construction
or
expansion
within
that
plant
that
increases
net
pollution
plant-wide
more
than
a
de
minimus
amount,
then
everybody's
agreed
that
new
source
review
comes
into
play.
but
under
the
bubble
approach,
within
a
plant
an
individual
machine
can
be
added
or
modified
without
new
source
review
if
additional
pollution
from
that
new
construction
is
offset
by
reductions
or
elimination
of
another
machine
so
that
there
is
no
significant
additional
net
increase.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
the
answer
to
this
is
i
believe
not
in
dispute
between
respondents
and
us.
they
way
this
works,
that
is
the
reason
there
are
significance
levels
in
this
situation
is
because
the
statute
only
comes
into
operation
if
there
is
a
major
stationary
source.
that
itself
is
defined
as--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
as
i
say,
it
comes
in
in
a
number
of
different
ways.
the
statute
first
of
all
says
that
if
you
are
building
something
that
is
less
than
100
tons
per
year,
that
it's
not
a
major
source
at
all;
and
under
either
definition
there
is
no
new
source
review.
that
is,
if
i
put
up
a
new
plant
that
is
99...
this
is
now
new
plants.
with
respect
to
modifications,
the
statute
says
there
has
to
be
a
major
modification
before
any
of
this
comes
into
play.
now
the
administrator
issued
regulations
interpreting
the
term
"major
modifications".
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
alabama
power
case
as
lawful.
that
is,
as
it
were,
the
source
of
the
significance
levels,
about
which
the
legality
of
which
i
believe
there
is
really
no
dispute,
and
which
really
operate
whether
you
have
a
bubble
definition
or
a
plant-wide
definition.
that
is,
under
the
plant-wide
definition,
too,
it
is
now
the
regulatory
structure
that
if
you
have
a
modification
that,
for
instance,
increases
a
machine
by
less
than
40
tons
per
year
with
respect
to
one
of
the
pollutants,
that
the
nsr
review
would
not
come
into
play
under
either
definition,
whether
that
is
a
source
or
not.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
parties
about
the
legality
of
the
establishment
of
the
significant
levels.
the
relevant
authority
on
that
is
the
alabama
power
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
examined
this
very
question
and
said
that,
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
should
have
meant
that
a
very
elaborate
and
very
expensive
administrative
mechanism
come
into
play
in
the
case
of
trivial
changes
in
emissions
levels.
of
course
our
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
the
case
that
every
time
there
is
a
change
in
plant
or
machinery
under
the
bubble
definition
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
increase
whatever.
the
plant
definition
may
very
well
create
reductions
in
emissions
levels.
because
if
i
have
a
machine
that
for
instance
pollutes
at
500
now,
an
existing
machine
that
pollutes
say
at
the
level
of
500
tons
a
year,
suppose
that
i
want
to
install
a
brand
new
and
very
efficient
new
machine
that
only
pollutes
at
450.
that
would
be
a
net
decrease
in
50.
under
the
bubble
definition,
nsr
would
not
come
into
play
at
all
because
you
have
an
offset,
and
therefore
i
can
install
the
new
machine.
under
the
plant--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--right,
your
honor.
if
we
collect
enough
offsets
within
the
plant
so
that
there
is--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--if
the
net
increase
in
the
plant
is
offset
with
anything
other
than
de
minimus.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
those
are
required
in
any
event.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
those
are
required
in
any
event.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
the
laer--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--that
is
right.
the
laer
is
required
only
if
you
have
a
source
that
is
a
source
within
the
meaning
of
new
source
review.
the
new
source
performance
standard
technology
has
to
be
installed
across
the
board,
whether
the
new
source
review
program
is
or
is
no
in
operation.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
that
that
purports
to
be
a
definition
of
when
the
regulatory
requirements
apply.
it
purports
to
explain
what
happens
to
that
piece
of
equipment
once
you've
decided
that
the
program
is
in
operation.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
your
honor.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
we,
the
government,
simply
doesn't
recognize
mr.
doniger's
description
of
the
act.
it
seems
to
us
that
he
has
collapsed
into
one
a
dazzlingly
intricate
statute,
has
given
it
a
straightforward
sort
of
one-purpose
interpretation,
that
there's
only
one
thing
going
on
here,
which
is
that
congress
meant
that
things
move
as
fast
as
possible
toward
maximum
expensive
technology.
now
in
fact
congress...
and
i
don't
know
where
he
was
reading
from
when
he
said
"the
following
are
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
"
we
read
those
reports
and
we
see
that
congress
had
a
number
of
different
purposes
in
mind:
state
flexibility--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--senator
muskie,
from
the
conference
report,
made
one
statement
which
we
discuss
in
our
reply
brief,
which
does
seem
to
presuppose...
although
it's
somewhat
ambiguous;
he
may
just
have
been
saying
that
what
he
was
insisting
was
that
the
new
provisions
do
apply
to
modifications
as
well
as
to
new
construction.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
don't
think,
if
that's
all
he
was
saying,
that
it
makes
any
difference.
but
we
think
the
most
fundamental
point
here
is
that
congress
was
trying
to
balance
a
number
of
different
problems.
it
found
the
'70
statute
to
be
deficient
because
it
did
not
sufficiently
balance
the
problem
of
renewal
and
growth
with
the
problem
of
achieving
attainment.
congress
said,
we
want
a
different
scheme.
so
everything
that
mr.
doniger
says
about
the
fact
that
ever
since
1971
this
is
the
way
it
was
defined,
we
have
here
congress
saying
we
really
want
to
take
a
slightly
different
path.
we
want
the
states
to
have
added
flexibility.
and
we
have
particularly
in
mind
the
problem
of
disincentives
to
growth.
the
bubble
idea
has
behind
it
a
very
simple
and
elegant
idea,
which
is:
that
you
will
have
incentives
to
growth
if
you
allow
industry
the
flexibility
to
spend
its
pollution
dollars
in
the
most
efficient
rather
than
the
least
efficient
way.
if
you
can
reduce
pollution
by
spending
a
million
dollars
on
machine
a,
that
is
a
better
idea
than
requiring
you
to
spend
two
million
dollars
on
having
the
same
reduction
by
making
you
do
it
on
machine
b.
if
i
have
a
machine
that
is
a
very
efficient
machine
and
i
want
to
double
its
capacity
and
that
will
create
200
new
tons
of
pollution,
it
may
cost
a
million
dollars
to
put
laer
on
that
to
bring
that
200
back
down
and
to
eliminate
the
200.
but
i
might
be
able
to
get
rid
of
the
200
simply
by
eliminating
the
next
machine,
which
is
an
inefficient
machine.
now
mr.
doniger's
whole
argument
is
that
if
we
insist
on
laer
on
the
new
machine
and
eliminate
the
old
machine,
we
will
get
rid
of
400
units.
but
you
have
created
a
one
million
dollar
extra
cost
on
the
expansion
of
your
efficient
machine.
the
choice
isn't
between
the
new
machine
with
laer
or
the
new
machine
with
laer,
because
the
antecedent
question
is
whether
the
plant
will
put
in
the
new
machine.
that
is,
the
question
is
on
the
incentives
to
renew
at
all.
under
the
source
definition,
under
the
tight
definition
that
mr.
doniger
puts
before
you,
we
have
the
antecedent
question:
will
there
be
renewal
at
all?
