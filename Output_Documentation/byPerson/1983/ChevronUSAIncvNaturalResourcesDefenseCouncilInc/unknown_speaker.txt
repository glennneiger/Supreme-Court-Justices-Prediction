unknown
speaker
do
you
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
had
the
same
view
had
the
agency
taken
the
same
definition
from
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
that
it's
changed
its
mind.
unknown
speaker
ways,
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there,
because
this
is
one
thing
i
wasn't
clear
on
from
the
brief.
you
say
the
statute
does
not
define
the
term
"source",
and
your
opponents
say
it
does.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
does
the
definition
of
111--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
so
it
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
that--
unknown
speaker
--they
don't
agree
with
you,
then,
that
there's
no
definition.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
statutory
definition
of
the
term
(a)
the
definition
does
not
apply
to
part
d?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
your
position
that
in
1977,
was
it,
they
intended
the
word
"source"
to
have
a
different
meaning
than
it
had
in
the
already
enacted
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
would
be
necessary
for
us
to
assume--
unknown
speaker
--and
of
course
the
language
of
the
definition
tends
to
cut
against
you
somewhat,
i
think,
because
it's
any
building
or
any
facility,
and
you
would
say
that
if
you've
got
three
buildings
in
a
plant,
that
you
don't
count
the
buildings
separately.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bator,
even
assuming,
arguendo,
that
your
position
is
correct
that
the
definition
of
source
in
the
previous
legislation
was
not
carried
over
for
the
new
source
review,
what
appears
to
me
to
have
been
done
here
is
that
epa
has
defined
source
for
purposes
of
7503
in
part
d
two
different
ways.
it's
given
a
broad
scope
definition
for
purposes
of
structuring
the
bubble
for
emissions
control,
and
then
it's
ignored
the
word
source
and
referred
to
emissions
units
for
purposes
of
engaging
lowest
achievable
emission
rate.
so
really
epa
has
defined
source
two
different
ways,
it
seems
to
me,
within
the
same
section
for
new
source
review.
and
would
you
explain
that
to
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
says
"source"
in
the
statute:
the
proposed
source
is
required
to
comply
with
the
lowest
achievable
emission
rate.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
epa
has
seized
upon
the
word
laer
purpose.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
same,
mr.
bator,
that
while
they
use
the
plant-wide
definition
to
determine
whether
a
source
is
new
or
modified,
once
they've
determined
that
it's
modified
they
impose
only,
as
you
said,
the
machine
laer
requirements?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
determine
that
it's
a
new,
rather
than
a
modified,
a
new
source?
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
i'm
getting
into
something
a
little
different.
that
is,
they
impose
the
laer
requirement
only
on
the
particular
machine
after
they've
determined,
using
the
plant-wide
definition,
that
the
source
is
either
new
or
modified.
unknown
speaker
now
i
understand
that's
done
when
they
determine
the
source
is
modified,
but
what
when
they
determine
the
source
is
new?
is
that
still
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
the
laer
standard?
how
is
that
imposed,
on
what,
when
they
determine
it's
a
new
source?
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
laer
requirements
apply
over
the
whole
plant
when
it's
a
new
source?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you
once
more.
unknown
speaker
nrdc
says
that
the
epa
regulations
allow
the
use
of
the
plant-wide
definition
even
in
states,
even
in
states
that
haven't
adopted
a
sip.
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
i
should
have
asked
nfdc
to
discuss
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
use
of
the
word
mr.
bator?
section
75.11(a)(4),
which
i
think
governs
the
new
source
review
engagement
says
that
any
increase
in
pollution
engages
the
review.
and
the
regulation
seems
to
have
adopted
a
"significant
increase"
definition,
not
just
"any
increase".
and
then
there
are
a
variety
of
levels
imposed,
100
tons
for
certain
kinds,
and
60
tons
for
others,
and
so
forth.
what
is
the
justification
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
defined,
but
i
think
the
section
does
say
any
increase
in
pollution
engages
review
under
new
source
review,
and
i
just
wondered
how
we
then
by
regulation
got
to
"significant
levels".
unknown
speaker
--if
you
install
another
machine
that
polluted
50
tons
more
than
your
old
one,
you
could
still
install
it
if
you
reduced
the
emissions
in
some
other
part
of
the
plant
by
50?
unknown
speaker
so
you
may
in
a
modification...
you
don't
have
to
employ
the
state-of-the-art
in
modifications.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
require
new
source
performance
standards
to
be
applied--
unknown
speaker
--apparently
to
the
individual
pieces
of
equipment.
unknown
speaker
but
not
the
laer--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
falls
within
your--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
you
look
at
section
7501(3)
it
looks
like
laer
has
to
be
applied.
it
just--
unknown
speaker
well,
even
under
the
government's
position,
though,
the
state
plan
is
going
to
have
to,
whether
it
uses
the
bubble
concept
or
not,
is
going
to
have
to
have
an
annual
improvement
in
the
air
quality.
the
plan
has
to
aim
at
that.
it
has
to
be
reasonably
aimed
at
achieving
that.
unknown
speaker
all
i
was
saying
is
that
even
under
the
government's
view,
the
air
quality
is
going
to
have
to
steadily
improve.
unknown
speaker
it
would
just
improve
faster
and
more
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
under...
i
guess
suppose
at
least
theoretically
it
may
be
that
your
position,
if
we
adopted
it,
wouldn't
improve
the
air
quality
in
these
regions
any
faster.
because
even
if
you
used
a...
even
if
you
were
required
to
use
the
best
piece
of
equipment
that
you
could,
you
may
not...
you
may
not
go
to
the
trouble
of
reducing
the
emissions
in
some
other
part
of
the
plant
that
you
would
if
you
were
allowed
under
the
bubble
concept.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
government's
view,
i
take
it,
that
if
a
new
piece
of
equipment
could
be
brought
into
a
plant
that
would
increase
emissions
by
500,
that
would
be
permissible
as
long
as
somewhere
else
in
the
plant
they
reduced
emissions
by
500.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
in
any
event,
as
long
as
they
reduced
emissions
sufficiently
in
some
other
part
of
the
plant.
you
say
that
if
it
were
possible
in
putting
in
the
new
piece
of
equipment
to
increase
emissions
less,
they
must
use
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
must
do
that,
and
if
they
did
it,
it
may
be
that
they
wouldn't
go
to
the
trouble
of
reducing
emissions
somewhere
else
in
the
plant.
unknown
speaker
justice
marshall
is--
unknown
speaker
--indisposed
today.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
this
provision
that
we're
fighting
about
been
in
force?
unknown
speaker
would
you
comment
on
the...
perhaps
it's
a
superficial
point,
but
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
there's
some
at
least
inconsistency
between
using
the
bubble
concept
in
programs
that
are
designed
to
maintain
quality
as
opposed
to
those
that
are...
and
then
to
forbid
it
in
programs
designed
to
improve
air
quality.
is
there
some
inconsistency
there?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
been
misinterpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals,
too?
unknown
speaker
didn't
it
require
that
different
definition?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
required,
not
authorized.
it
required
that
different--
unknown
speaker
--well,
your
central
position,
then,
if
i
understand
you,
is
that
if
you
need
say
three
smaller
units
to
be
aggregated
into
one
plant
to
qualify
as
a
source,
you
just
have
to
be
consistent
in
treating
that
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
and
if
each
of
the
three
was
large
enough
to
be
a
source
all
by
itself,
then
you're
dealing
with
three
sources--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
can't
aggregate
them
into
a
bubble.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
was
senator
muskie
talking
about,
for
example?
unknown
speaker
what
if
that
was
what
he
was
saying?
does
that
make
any
difference
to
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
mandated
that.
that's
all.
it's
really
not
for
us
to
determine--
unknown
speaker
--which
policy
makes
the
more
sense.
it's
what
congress
mandated.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
argument
of
course
is
that
they
intended
to
change
the
statutory
definition
and
delegate
to
the
administrator
the
power
to
define
source
without
saying
so
in
so
many
words.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
normally
when
you
find
a
term
defined
in
the
statute
and
you
don't
find
any
alternative
definitions,
your
first
impression
is
it
probably
has
the
same
meaning
throughout
the
statute...
at
least
that's
the
way
i
start
when
i
read
complicated
statutes.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
the
things
they
had
to
do
was
to
redefine
the
term
"source",
but
they
just
sort
of
did
it
implicitly,
or
allowed
you
to
do
it
implicitly,
or
allowed
your
client
to
do
it
implicitly.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
part
of
your
submission
was
that
even
with
this
alleged
definition--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
