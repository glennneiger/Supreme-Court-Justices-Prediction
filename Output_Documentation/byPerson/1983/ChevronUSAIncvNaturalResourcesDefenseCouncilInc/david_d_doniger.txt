mr.
david
d.
doniger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
said,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statute
defines
the
term
"stationary
source"
for
the
purpose
of
this
program,
and
we
contend
that
it
does.
section
110(a)(2)(d)
is
the
key
provision.
section
110(a)(2),
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
train
case
is
what
sets
forth
the
mandatory
contents
of
every
state
plan.
subparagraph
(d)
establishes
what
each
state
plan
must
contain
in
the
way
of
new
source
review
requirements.
subparagraph
(d)
uses
the
term
"source"
twice.
one
use
of
that
term
is
explicitly
tied
to
section
111,
and
the
definition
of
source
in
that
section
111
is,
a
source
is
a
building,
a
structure,
a
facility,
or
an
installation.
the
other
use
of
the
term
is
in
a
clause
not
five
lines
away
which
requires
each
state
plan
to
contain
a
permit
program
as
provided
in
part
(d).
the
two
uses
of
the
term
in
the
same
subparagraph
ought
to
be
presumed
to
have
the
same
meaning.
that's
the
only
reasonable
conclusion,
particularly
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
subparagraph
(d).
subparagraph
(d)
is
the
result
of
congress'
having
looked
at
the
new
source
review
procedure
that
was
provided
in
section...
in
subparagraph
(d)
in
the
1970
act,
deciding
that
it
was
inadequate,
that
it
did
not
provide
for
careful
review
of
new
sources,
and
deciding
that
it
needed
to
be
strengthened
by
creating
the
permit
program
that
we
find
in
section
173.
it
is
not
credible
to
suggest
that
when
congress
amended
subparagraph
(d)
in
1977
to
add
to
it
the
permit
program
for
stationary
sources.
it
meant
the
term
"stationary
sources"
to
mean
something
new,
something
different
than
it
already
meant
in
the
same
subparagraph.
well,
having
established
that
the
two
uses
of
the
term
have
the
same
meaning,
what
is
that
meaning?
again,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
has
suggested,
a
term
such
as
building
and
structure
plainly
refer
to
individual
industrial
units
like
boilers
and
blast
furnaces,
things
that
actually
produce
pollution.
these
terms,
we
contend,
can't
reasonably
be
defined
exclusively
as
entire
plants.
the
1977
legislative
history,
moreover,
specifically
rules
out
the
bubble
definition
that
epa
has
adopted.
it
explicitly
bars
a
new
project
from
escaping
the
permit
review
just
by
obtaining
an
offset
from
within
the
same
plant.
and
i
refer
you
to
page
36
of
our
brief
which
quotes
the
statement
of
senator
muskie
who
was
chairman
of
the
senate
conferences,
and
he
was
explaining
the
meaning
of
the
permit
program
required
by
the
conference
bill
to
be
included
in
every
state
plan.
he
said,
",
a
new
source
is
still
subject
to
such
requirements
as
"lowest
achievable
emission
rate"
even
if
it
is
used
as
a
replacement
for
an
older
facility
resulting
in
a
new
reduction
from
previous
emission
levels.
"
he
was
there
explicitly
referring
to
the
situation
where
someone
takes
a
facility
in
a
plant,
retires
it,
and
replaces
it
with
a
new
one,
a
new
boiler
or
blast
furnace.
and
he
said,
you're
still
subject
to
permit
review.
you
cannot
net
out
of
the
permit
review
simply
by
getting
an
offset.
now
the
reasons
why
congress
was
not
satisfied
with
just
an
offset
that
keeps
the
pollution
from
increasing
are
plain
in
the
requirements
and
purposes
of
section
173.
in
enacting
that
section,
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
wasn't
enough
just
to
keep
pollution
from
increasing.
first,
pollution
had
to
be
made
to
decrease.
the
offset
that's
required
in
section
173(1)
is
an
offset
which
is
more
than
equal
to
the
pollution
that
the
new
boiler
is
going
to
add.
the
pollution
overall
has
to
be
reduced.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
the
government
i
think
is
arguing
that
if
the
plan
makes
up
the
lost
ground
by
not
having
the
source...
not
having
the
thing
subject
to
the
permit
review,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
but
the
act
itself--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
well,
what
we
have
here
is
congress
deciding
that
new
sources
were
going
to
have
to
play
a
specific
role
in
that
reducing
of
pollution,
and
the
plan
was
going
to
have
to
make
whatever
residual
reduction
was
necessary
from
any
other
source
the
state--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--provided.
but
congress
not
only
wanted
the
new
sources
to
produce
that
reduction,
but
to
do
two
other
things,
as
well.
the
first
was,
they
were
supposed
to
put
on
the
lowest
achievable
emission
rate
technology,
technology
which
is
defined
as
equal
to
the
best
that
somebody
of
that
kind
is
already
using,
in
order
to
make
the
lowest
possible...
the
least
possible
call
on
the
air
quality,
on
the
pollution
reduction
opportunities
that
that
state
has.
we
have
states
which
are
way
over
the
limit
for
the
amount
of
pollution
that
they
can
have
in
compliance
with
the
health
standards.
they
have
to
reduce
that.
most
of
that
reduction
is
going
to
have
to
come
from
existing
sources.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
well,
under
section
173
you
have
to
do
three
things.
you
have
to
make
that
offset--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--so
that
you
get
a
net
reduction.
you
have
to
use
the
best
technology
which
makes
it
easier,
by
the
way,
to
meet
that
first
requirement
because
your
offset
doesn't
have
to
be
as
big.
and
the
third
requirement,
which
is
in
173(3),
is
that
the
new
source...
the
firm
building
the
new
source
has
to
demonstrate
that
its
existing
sources
are
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
that
apply
to
them.
these
are
three
things
that
congress
wanted
the
permit
process
to
provide.
epa
is
suggesting
that
if
you
only
do
one
of
those
things,
if
you
only
offset
pollution
back
to
the
starting
point,
you
have
done
everything
that
section
173
intended
that
congress
wanted
done,
and
that
is
not
correct.
congress
wanted
pollution
offset
beyond
the
starting
point.
congress
wanted
the
best
technology
put
on
these
new
facilities,
and
congress
wanted
the
company
building
them
to
make
sure
that
it
was
complying
with
the
law
at
each
of
its
other
facilities
in
the
same
state.
those
things
are
lost.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
well,
by
460
because
the
levels
allow
actual
increases.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
if,
for
example,
in
your
hypothetical
that
the
application
of
the
advanced
technology
meant
that
the
boiler
would
increase
pollution
by
400
instead
of
by
500
tons,
then
the
offset
would
be
correspondingly
less
and,
to
the
extent
that
you
had
used
up
some
opportunity
for
reduction,
just
to
stay
even
with
the
new
boiler,
the
state
could
use
that
reduction
opportunity
to
make
further
progress
towards
the
standards.
so
if
you
have
poorly
controlled
new
sources
coming
in,
then
just
staying
even
requires
going
deeper
into
the
well
of
offset
opportunities,
and
it
makes
it
even
harder
to
meet
the
health
standards
or
the
deadlines
which
congress
has
required
they
be
met
by.
so
a
great
deal
is
being
given
up
when
a
major
source
is
left
out
of
the
permit
process.
i
want
to
point
out
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
minor
exemption
on
the
periphery
of
the
law;
we're
talking
about
an
exemption
which
applies
to
90
percent
or
more
of
the
major
projects
which
are
built
in
our
cities
which
don't
meet
the
health
standards.
because
the
statistics
that
we
have
put
forth,
which
no
one
in
this
case
contests,
are
that
almost
every
major
project
built
in
a
polluted
area
is
built
within
a
plant,
not
at
a
new
site.
and
in
almost
every
case,
they
have
shown
themselves
to
be
able
to
get
their
offset.
when
they
comply
with
all
three
conditions,
they
get
their
offset
from
inside
the
plant.
anybody
who
can
do
that
can
certainly
get
the
offset
that
the
government
would
like
to
make
available
to
avoid
meeting
the
other
requirements.
so
that
90
percent
of
the
big
projects
are
allowed
to
escape
review.
the
purposes,
i
would
like
to
amplify
a
little
bit
the
purposes
of
the
lowest
achievable
emission
rate
technology
requirement
and
the
compliance
requirement.
at
page
39
of
our
brief
we
cite
the
three
purposes
given
by
the
house
report.
the
lowest
achievable
emission
rate
technology
is
there
to
make
sure
that
these
new
sources
contribute
as
little
new
pollution
as
possible
to
the
area
so
that
they
minimize
the
conflict
between
allowing
growth
and
making
progress
toward
the
health
standards.
the
second
condition...
the
second
purpose
is
to
make
it
possible
for
an
area
to
have
as
many
new
sources
as
possible
without
compromising
those
health
standards.
and
the
third
reason
is
to
serve
the
purpose
of
advancing
technology
of
improving
the
rate
at
which
it's
developed
and
deployed
on
new
sources.
all
of
those
things
are
lost
if
lowest
achievable
emission
rate
technology
is
not
applied
to
these
90
percent
of
the
major
projects.
the
third
requirement
is
the
requirement
to
demonstrate
compliance.
i
refer
you
to
page
39
of
our
brief
again.
the
house
report
language...
the
house
report
passages
discussed
there
are
ones
in
which
the
house
had
found
that
there
was
an
alarming
level
of
noncompliance
with
the
law
in
1975
and
1976,
and
they
sought
to
create
a
new
incentive
to
comply
by
making
someone
who
wanted
to
build
a
new
source
responsible
for
demonstrating
that
he
was
complying
with
the
law
with
the
sources
that
he
already
owned.
these
are
important
purposes
which
are
rendered
unachieved
completely
if
nothing
applies,
if
not
of
these
projects
fall
under
the
definition
of
source
and
therefore
under
the
permit
requirement.
it
is
a
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
an
agency
can't
rewrite
a
definition
to
subvert
specific
statutory
requirements
that
were
adopted
to
serve
specifically
articulated
congressional
purposes,
yet
under
this
definition
all
three
of
the
important
purposes
congress
intended
section
173
to
serve
are
frustrated.
now
i
want
to
amplify
on
an
aspect
of
justice
white's
question
of
a
few
moments
ago.
the
government
has
suggested
in
its
briefs
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
all
these
things
are
lost,
provided
that
there
is
a
plan
which
will
on
paper
at
least
project
meeting
the
deadlines...
meeting
the
standards
by
the
deadlines
of
the
law.
congress
has
clearly
decided
that
it's
not
enough
to
have
a
plan
that
projects
progress
and
attainment
by
the
deadlines.
it
has
established
a
two-track
system
which
doesn't
put
all
of
its
eggs
in
one
basket.
in
1970,
and
again
in
1977,
congress
specifically
chose
not
to
put
total
reliance
on
that
plan.
the
history
of
the
act
shows
that
that
was
a
wise
judgment,
because
the
plans
alone
don't
work
sufficiently
to
meet
the
standards
on
time.
in
the
early
'70s
under
the
obligation
to
develop
a
plan
to
meet
the
standards
by
1975,
every
state
submitted
a
plan
which
it
projected
would
do
that.
but
when
the
'75
deadline
passed,
although
there
had
been
progress,
two-thirds
of
the
nation's
people
still
lived
in
areas
that
didn't
meet
health
standards.
in
1977,
congress
called
for
a
new
round
of
plans
to
meet
the
deadlines
by
1982.
but
by
the
end
of
1982,
there
were
still
more
than
100
major
metropolitan
areas
which
don't
meet
the
health
standards.
the
projection
of
attainment
all
by
itself
is
useful
but
not
reliable
all
by
itself,
and
that's
why
it's
backed
up
by
specific
requirements
that
apply
to
major
stationary
sources.
it
seems
to
me
a
novel
proposition
that
by
complying
with
one
of
those
three
conditions,
albeit
only
partly
the
offset
condition,
something
which
otherwise
would
be
a
source,
it's
a
thing
by
itself
that
emits
the
requisite
amount
of
pollution
is
not
a
source
at
all
anymore
and
can
forget
entirely
about
the
other
conditions
that
would
normally...
that
it
would
normally
be
subject
to.
now
justice
marshall
asked
a
question
about
situations
in
which
epa
is
applying--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--i'm
sorry.
justice
brennan--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--in
situations
where
there
is
no
state
plan,
that
even
on
paper
purports
to
provide
a
method
for
getting
to
the
standards
on
time.
and
that
situation
is
the
construction
moratorium
situation,
and
also
epa's
offset
ruling,
two
situations.
both
of
those
apply
in
situations
where
the
state
either
has
not
yet
written
the
plan,
or
is
overdue
for
writing
the
plan.
what
epa
has
said
there
is
that
it's
okay
to
use
a
definition
which
lets
90
percent
of
the
projects
which
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
the
moratorium
escape
the
moratorium,
regardless
of
whether
they
may
increase
pollution,
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they're
not
even
being
built
with
lowest
achievable
emission
rate
technology
and
with
a
certification
by
the
source
builder
that
its
other
sources
are
meeting
the
requirements
applicable
to
them.
so
in
that
case,
the
government
doesn't
even
have
the
fig
leaf
of
protection
from
the
requirement
that
the
state
have
a
plan
that
promises
to
meet
the
standards
on
time.
one
final
argument
that
i'd
like
to
mention
that
the
government
makes
is
that,
on
the
assumption
that
it
has
some
discretion
in
this
area,
on
the
assumption
that
the
statute
doesn't
require
coverage
of
these
major
units,
the
government
is
arguing
that
its
definition
actually
makes
things
better.
and
the
argument
for
that
case
is
that,
they
say,
that
the
older
definition
which
epa
had
for
10
years,
which
covered
the
units,
might
discourage
in
some
instances
the
replacement
of
a
project
which
might
be
cleaner
than
the
thing
that
it
was
replacing.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
the
original
definition
which
covered
units
has
been
in
effect
from
1971
through
october
of
1981,
and
the
revised
definition
which
allows
the
units
to
escape
the
review
has
been
in
effect
only
since
october
of
1981.
and
in
the
10
prior
years,
we
had
the
units
being
covered.
in
fact,
in
1976
epa
established
the
offset
ruling...
excuse
me.
i
would
like
to
return
to
a
question
about
the
law
for
a
moment.
one
of
the
government's
arguments
is
that
a
provision
explicitly
incorporating
the
unit
definition
was
dropped
from
the
senate
bill
in
the
1977
conference
committee.
in
order
to
make
that
argument
work,
that
the
dropping
of
that
section
302(m)
was
meaningful
and
was
intended
to
exclude...
to
drop
the
unit
definition,
have
to
be
able
to
show
that
the
house
bill
coming
to
the
conference
intended
something
different
than
the
senate
bill.
and
i
believe
we
can
show
that
the
house
bill
covered
units
just
as
much
as
the
senate
bill.
the
house
bill
provided
for
new
source
review
by
adopting
into
the
law
epa's
1976
regulations.
epa's
1976
regulations
specifically
provided
that
every
building,
structure,
facility,
or
installation
which
emits
more
than
100
tons
was
subject
to
this
review
process.
so
the
house
came
into
the
conference
with
a
unit-specific
definition;
the
senate
came
in
with
a
unit-specific
definition;
they
conferenced
their
language
to
conform
it
into
what
we
see
in
the
final
law;
and
at
the
end
of
the
conference
senate
muskie
went
back
and
explained
to
his
colleagues
that
the
bubble
was
not
allowed.
i
think
in
that
legislative
history
context
it
is
not
credible
to
claim
that
congress
left
open
the
question
whether
units
like
boilers
and
blast
furnaces
were
covered
by
the
permit
requirements.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
it's
our
position
that
all
three
of
these
programs
ought
to
have
the
same
unit
definition.
the
alabama
power
case
i
think
has
been
misinterpreted
by
the
government
and--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--i
think
so,
in
that
if
you
read
that
case,
what
it
says
is
that...
well,
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
epa
could
aggregate
small
units
that
were
not
major,
in
and
of
themselves,
but
were
built
all
at
the
same
time
into
a
group
that
together
emitted
more
than
the
threshold
amount
of
pollution,
and
then
subject
that
group
to
new
source
review.
and
epa
had
done
that
by
adopting
a
definition
that
included
the
phrase
"or
combination
thereof",
combination
of
the
buildings,
and
structures,
and
so
forth.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
can't
do
that;
you're
restricted
to
those
four
words,
but
we
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
you
to
define
"facility"
or
"installation"
not
only
as
a
unit
but
as
a
plant,
too.
there
you
get
the
dual
definition
of
the
source.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
i
believe
it
requires
that--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--what
it
requires
is
that
if
you
are
building
a
bunch
of
small
units
at
the
same
time,
or
you're
adding
a
small
unit,
one
that
is
not
by
itself
large
enough
to
qualify
as
a
major
source...
i.e.,
by
itself
it's
not
a
100-ton
emitter...
then
the
only
way
epa
can
subject
that
thing
to
new
source
review
is
by
virtue
of
making
it
a
modification
of
the
whole
plant.
and
if
the
only
way
it
is
subject
to
new
source
review
is
by
virtue
of
it
being
a
modification
of
the
whole
plant,
then
you
ought
to...
then
the
symmetry
of
it
is
that
you
have
to
let
the
plant
owner
get
an
offset
within
the
plant
in
order
to
eliminate
the
net
increase
in
its
plant's
emissions.
if
that
unit
by
itself
is
major
in
size,
it
does
emit
more
than
100
tons,
or
in
the
case
of
that
other
program
it's
a
higher
level
of
250
tons,
but
if
those
thresholds
are
crossed,
that
thing,
that
boiler
is
subject
to
review
all
on
its
own,
regardless
of
whether
it's
located
on
a
greenfield
site
or
in
a
plant.
but
even
if
alabama
power
is
rightly
interpreted
as
mandating
a
plant-wide
definition
for
the
program
to
limit
how
much
worse
pollution
can
get
where
it's
currently
better
than
the
standards,
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
reducing
pollution
to
let
sources
which
it
applies
in
this
program,
to
let
these
big
projects
escape
from
all
the
pollution
reducing
requirements
that
are
found
in
section
173.
so
to
the
extent
the
distinction
means
that
when
the
program
is
to
reduce
pollution
it's
not
legal
to
let
these
sources
out
of
it,
it's
right.
to
the
extent
that
the
distinction
is
used
to
say
that
ever
in
a
pollution
increasing
program
like
part
(c)
you
don't
need
the
unit
definition,
i
think
that
that's
a
misinterpretation
of
the
opinion.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
i
want
to
return
to
the
modernization
argument
for
a
moment,
which
i
had
started
on.
epa's
position
is
that...
or
argument
is
that
sometimes
in
a
few
cases
you
will
find
that
a
project
is
delayed
a
little
bit,
which
if
it
were
allowed
to
be
built
even
with
poor
controls,
would
be
cleaner
than
the
thing
that
it's
replacing,
and
that
this
justifies
changing
the
definition.
what
epa
has
failed
to
do,
though,
is
look
at
all
the
instances
in
which
the
poorly
controlled
sources
result
in
more
pollution
than
they
would
have
if
they
were
subject
to
the
permit
requirement
and
those
three
requirements
were
imposed.
this
is
a
case
just
like
mvma
v.
state
farm
where
the
government's
rationale...
again,
assuming
it
has
some
discretion...
is
defective
because
it
only
considers
a
small
fragment
of
the
problem
before
it.
it
doesn't
consider
what
happens
in
all
the
instances
where
its
definition
makes
things
worse
rather
than
better.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
stop
here.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
and
mr.
doniger
comes
here
and
he
says
that
congress,
by
positive
law,
has
eliminated
the
administrator's
discretion.
and
we
say:
show
us
where
the
law
says
that?
show
us
where
the
structure
of
the
statute
requires
that.
and
then
we
get
very
complicated
and
rather
artificial
explanations
of
why
congress
said
one
thing
but
meant
another.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
your
honor,
that
statutory
definition
that
he
speaks
about
was
never
an
all
purpose
definition
even
back
in--
mr.
david
d.
doniger
--your
honor,
in
this
case
congress
was
thinking
about
a
particular
program,
which
of
course
was
machine-oriented.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
your
honor,
our
submission
is
that
congress
really
wasn't
focusing...
wasn't
focusing
specifically
on
what
should
count
as
a
"source"
for
new
source
performance.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that
is
also
the
case.
mr.
david
d.
doniger
that
is
our
alternative
argument,
justice
white,
and
that
is
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals,
at
least
in
these
other
contexts,
accepted.
