unknown
speaker
that's
on...
those
questions
are
asked
at
the
scene?
unknown
speaker
yes.
right
then
and
there,
he
asked
him
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
when
he
made
out
the
report.
unknown
speaker
he
asked
him
those
questions.
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
that
after
that
the
arrest?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
that
mean...
point
zero?
unknown
speaker
was
the
machine
out
of
order?
unknown
speaker
it
might
have
been
some
other
reason
besides
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
would
be
drugs,
not
alcohol.
unknown
speaker
what's
this
in
his
handwriting
on
the
front
of
the
form?
unknown
speaker
i'm
looking
at
what
you
referred
us
to
at
page
ja2.
unknown
speaker
i'm
really
looking
at
the
back.
unknown
speaker
under
his
signature?
unknown
speaker
and
i
can't
decipher
it.
what's
he
say?
unknown
speaker
but
he
said
he
had
smoked
two--
unknown
speaker
--plus
this
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
the
sixth
circuit
necessarily
disagreed
with
you
on
that,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
held
inadmissible?
you
might
tell
us
that.
unknown
speaker
but
they
said,
did
they
not,
the
majority,
and
judge
wellford
agreed
that
the
respondent
was
not
in
custody
until
he
had
been
formally
placed
under
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
certainly
what
it
looks
like.
the
court
didn't
feel
bound
by
the
parties'
stipulation
on
custody
and
determined
that
he
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
take
a
look
at
the
penultimate
paragraph
of
the
majority's
opinion
on
page
a20
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
you
may
have
it
somewhere
else.
this
is
what
judge
martin
and
his
colleague
are
saying.
"we
believe
that
the
facts
of
the
present
case
require
that
trooper
williams
should
have
advised
mccarty
of
his
constitutional
right.
"
"at
the
point
that
trooper
williams
took
mccarty
to
the
police
station,
his
freedom
of
action
was
curtailed
in
a
significant
way.
"
"the
failure
to
advise
mccarty
of
his
constitutional
rights
rendered
at
least
some
of
his
statements
inadmissible.
"
now,
i
grant
you
that's
ambiguous,
but
it
seems
to
me
they're
talking
about
statements
made
after
he
was
really
taken
in
the
squad
car.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
this
is
the
correct
reading,
that
all
they
held
was
that
the
statements
made
after
he
was
taken
into
custody
were
inadmissible.
are
you
arguing
here
that
the
statements
made
after
formal
custody
are
admissible
or
not?
unknown
speaker
on
the
scene.
unknown
speaker
but
just
before
you
do,
i
just
wanted
to
mention,
on
a19
they
also
said
we
do
not
hold
that
the
mere
stopping
of
a
motor
vehicle
triggers
miranda,
because
the
police
gather
information
on
misdemeanor
traffic
offenses,
primarily
through
on-the-scene
questions.
so
isn't
it
quite
clear
that--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
before
you
get
into
your
main
argument?
what's
happened?
is
the
man...
has
he
served
the
sentence
or--
unknown
speaker
--there
was
a
stay.
unknown
speaker
and
he
entered
a
guilty
plea,
but
it
was
kind
of
a
conditional
plea
or
some
kind.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
issue
is
only...
let's
just
assume
the
issue
here
is
only
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
made
after
formal
custody
had
taken
place.
then
what
is...
the
only
piece
of
evidence
at
issue
is
what
he
signed
at
the
bottom,
on
the
back
side
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
report
was
admitted
into
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
the
defendant
had
made
other
statements
before
formal
arrest,
and
those,
presumably
under
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
would
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
harmless
error
here?
unknown
speaker
did
you
raise
it
below?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
before
custodial
arrest
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
you're
still
on
your
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
but
if
your
logic
is
correct,
your
hypothetical
detective
could
go
into
the
cell
block,
determine
that
the
guy
was
drunk
and
therefore
not
capable
of
waiving
his
miranda
rights,
and
say
well,
why
give
them
at
all;
since
he
can't
appreciate
them,
it
would
just
be
counterproductive.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
i
mean,
presumably,
a
person
could
get
drunk
in
their
cell
block,
even
though
they
weren't
charged
with
drunken
driving.
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
hasn't
taken...
if
he
hasn't
made
a
custodial
arrest,
i
don't
see
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
prevent
you
from
asking
those
questions.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
officer
typically
makes
preliminary
inquiries
in
the
terry-type
stop
of
anybody
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense,
to
see
whether
there
is
any
legitimate
cause
for
concern
that
there
is
a
dwi.
unknown
speaker
they
all
do
that.
they
fill
out
these
forms
later
on
at
the
station.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
they
have
dual
evidence.
they
have
the
on-the-scene
questioning
which
apparently
the
sixth
circuit
doesn't
find
fault
with
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
officer
has
quite
a
bit
of
experience
by
the
time
he
gets
around
to
the
station
house
questioning.
he's
observed
the
person
who
was
stopped,
he's
made
on-the-scene
questions,
he's
transported
him
to
the
station.
there's
been
a
lot
of
going
on.
and
by
that
time,
you
have
some
basis
for
knowing
how
impaired
a
person
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
usually
is.
i
mean
the
reality
of
the
situation
is,
the
scenario
unfolds
in
the
typical
case,
just
like
it
did
here.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
not
100
percent,
but
this
is
a
pretty
typical
situation.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
isn't
when
there's
drugs.
unknown
speaker
usually,
drugs
don't
show
up
on
a
breathalyzer.
unknown
speaker
mr.
travis,
can
i
ask
one
question
about
your
hypothetical,
your
concern
about
the
man's
ability
to
waive
and
all
the
rest.
but
why
couldn't
you
just
give
the
miranda
warning
at
the
outset
of
this
questioning
anyway?
i
don't
quite
understand
what
the
problem
is.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
see
the
harm
in
giving
the
miranda
warning.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
simple
rule
is,
normally
you
take
somebody
to
the
station,
ask
him
questions,
you
start
out
giving
the
miranda
warnings,
and
we
don't
have
to
litigate
these
questions.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
the
practical,
sensible
thing
to
do,
to
give
the
miranda
warning
at
the
outset
to
a
custodial
situation,
and
then
let
the
defendant
later
say
he
didn't
understand
it.
how
can
we
have
policemen
making
diagnostic
decisions
on
the
ground?
unknown
speaker
you're
really
putting
the
policeman
up
to
making
a
diagnostic
decision
which
really
isn't
his
business.
unknown
speaker
well,
diagnosing
whether
he
can
understand
the
miranda
warning.
why
not
give
him
the
miranda
warning,
and
if
he
later
wants
to
make
the
point
that
he
didn't
understand
it,
weight
on
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
you
certainly
are
interested
in
having
it
made
clear
here,
if
you
possibly
can
have
it
mad
clear,
that
on-the-spot
precustody
questioning
doesn't
require
miranda
warnings.
unknown
speaker
i
would
expect
that
there
will
be
argument
on
the
other
side
that
it
does.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
the
major
part
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
miranda
opinion
itself
say
that
generally,
these
general
questions
on
the
scene
were
not
covered
by
miranda?
unknown
speaker
you
are
very
positive
as
to
that?
that
they
did
permit
him...
permit
the
earlier
statements.
unknown
speaker
and
you
can
get
that
from
a
reading
of
the
sixth
circuit
majority
opinion?
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
you--
unknown
speaker
--by
preclude,
you
mean
they
would
allow
the
admission
into
evidence
of
those
statements
made
at
the
scene.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
cross-appeal?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you're
entitled
to
press
this.
if
you
really
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
as
permitting
the
evidence
taken
at
the
scene
to
be
admitted.
i'm
not
sure
you're
entitled
to
argue
that
it
shouldn't...
those
statements
shouldn't...
that
would
really
vary
the
judgment
below.
it
wouldn't
just
be...
it
wouldn't
be
an
affirmance;
it
would
be
a
partial
reversal.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be.
but
nevertheless,
if
we
accepted
your...
if
we
agreed
with
you
about
on-the-scene
questioning,
the
trial
would
be
considerably
different
than
it
would
be
under
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion,
as
you
read
it
even.
there
would
be
other
evidence
that
would
not
be
admitted.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
certainly
vary
the
consequence
of
the
judgment
considerably.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
did...
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
should
issue
and
there
had
to
be
a
retrial,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
simply
saying
that,
for
a
somewhat
different
reason,
the
same
judgment
should
be
entered.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judgment
is
that
there
be
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying,
for
somewhat
different
reasons
than
the
court
of
appeals
said,
there
should
be
also
be...
the
same
judgment
should
be
entered
as
was
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
certainly
have
a
different
consequence
on
the
trial,
on
what
would
happen
at
the
retrial.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think
that
when
the
officer...
under
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
when
the
officer
wanted
to
testify
about
the
on-the-scene
questioning,
it
would
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
and
under
your
view,
it
would
not
be
admissible.
unknown
speaker
it
can
also
be
used
for
record
purposes.
unknown
speaker
it
can
also
be
used
for
record
purposes.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
amount
of
drinks
and
all,
that's
used
for.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far
to
win.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
make
the
point
that
part
of
it's
used
for
that,
that's
enough.
you
don't
have
to
say
that
all
it
is
used
for...
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
meeks,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
adopt
your
stipulation.
at
least
that's
what
i
understand
your
opponent
contends.
your
stipulation
really
would
have
placed
him
in
miranda
purposes
custody
earlier
than
the
time
that
the
custodial
arrest
is
made.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
really
rejected
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
read
their
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
logically
that
they
did
reject
it,
because
if
they
had
accepted
it,
they
would
have
said...
moved
the
point
at
which
evidence
should
be
excluded
back
further
in
time.
unknown
speaker
and
no
one
disputes
that.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
very
end.
unknown
speaker
now
you
said
miranda
emphasized
or
focused
on
the
kind
of
interrogation.
did
it
not
focus
very
largely
on
the
place
of
the
interrogation?
unknown
speaker
in
the
station
house.
unknown
speaker
that
was
still
pretty
close
custody,
though,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
meeks?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
something
of
an
expansion
of
miranda,
would
it
not,
to
say
that
something
short
of
full
custodial
arrest
brings
on
miranda?
are
you
familiar
with
our
recent
opinion
in
california
against
beheler?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
say
that
the
thing
that
triggers
that
miranda
is
custodial
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
terry
stop.
we've
never
held
miranda
was
applicable
in
terry
stops.
unknown
speaker
where
have
we
held
that
miranda
was
applicable
to
a
terry
stop?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
if
a
police
officer
has
only
reasonable
suspicion
and
stops
somebody,
he
doesn't
have
to
give
miranda
warnings,
but
if
he
has
probable
cause
and
stops
him,
he
has
to
give
them?
unknown
speaker
that's
standing
the
thing
on
its
head.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
terry
stop
puts
a
man
in
some
kind
of
custody,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
everybody--
unknown
speaker
--that
just
is
not
a
holding
of
our
courts,
and
i
think
that
argument
just
doesn't
find
support
in
any
of
our
cases.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
officer
has
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion.
it's
what
the
officer
does,
whether
he
places
the
person
under
formal
arrest
or
its
equivalent,
and
the
deprivation
of
freedom
in
a
significant
way
language
was
rather
cut
back
on
in
the
recent
california
v.
beheler
case.
and
the
court
talked
about
formal
arrest
or
its
equivalent.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
terry
stop.
just
like
somebody
on
the
street.
you
stop
him,
and
the
officer
stops
him
and
won't
permit
him
to
leave,
granted.
that
doesn't
turn
it
into
a
custodial
arrest
requiring
miranda,
and
that's
all
you've
got
on
the
street
with
an
automobile
stop.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
concerned
with
trying
to
get
the
court
to
adopt
some
other
rule
to
require
an
officer
to
make
an
arrest
at
a
certain
time,
based
on
what
he
knows,
but
i
don't
think
that
question
is
before
us.
well,
we've
rejected
it
countless
times,
the
idea
that
if
an
officer
has
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
person,
the
person
will
be
deemed
arrested,
even
though
the
officer
doesn't
make
the
arrest
till
later.
but
that
simply
has
not
been
adopted
by
this
court.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
meeks,
in
this
very
case,
as
i
understand
the
sequence
of
events,
the
questioning
on
the
scene
took
place
before
the
officer
decided
to
take
him
back
to
the
station.
unknown
speaker
but
he
didn't
tell
him,
let's
go
to
the
station
until
after
he
had
these
initial
questions,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
under
your
submission,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
when
the
officer
says,
in
substance,
okay,
let's
go
to
the
station?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
enter
into
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
that
test,
every
time
you're
stopped...
as
soon
as
you're
stopped,
your
test
triggers
in,
then.
unknown
speaker
how
about
this
hypothetical?
you
would
say
it
cannot
follow.
unknown
speaker
under
your
test,
when
the
man
is
not
free
to
leave
is
the
triggering
of
the
duty
to
impose...
to
give
miranda
warning.
every
traffic
stop
must
immediately
be
followed
by
miranda
warnings
or
else
the
questioning
would
be
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
submission,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
my
problem
is
a
man
who
gets
pulled
over
for
not
having
one
tail
light
on.
and
he
looks
at
him
and
he's
as
drunk
as
kennedy
brown.
when
did
the
miranda
warning
come
up?
unknown
speaker
the
broken
tail
light
on
the
car.
unknown
speaker
so
he's
pulled
over.
and
before
the
officer
asks
him
any
question,
he
looks
at
him,
and
the
guy
is
obviously
drunk.
unknown
speaker
when
is
the
miranda
warning
called
for?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
he
interrogate
him
without
the
miranda
warning?
unknown
speaker
well,
obviously,
that's
what
i
was
talking
about.
without
the
miranda
warning,
even
though
he
was
obviously
drunk?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
he
asked
him,
are
you
drunk?
would
that
be
out
of
bounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
we
don't
know
the
officer's
observations
or
what
the
officer
thinks
until
the
trial
of
the
case,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
know
what
the
rest
of
this
is
all
about.
unknown
speaker
if
you
tell
the
officer
the
law
is
this,
the
officer
will
say
one
thing.
if
somebody
