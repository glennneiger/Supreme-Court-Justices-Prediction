mr.
r.
william
meeks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
putting
this
case
in
a
proper
factual
setting
as
it
pertains
to
the
alcohol
influence
report
form
that
the
court
has
had
the
opportunity
to
review.
the
sixth
circuit's
ruling
basically
does
two
things.
it
precludes
the
use
of
statements
made
by
mr.
mccarty
while
in
custody
at
the
franklin
county
jail.
it
permits
into
evidence
statements
made
by
mr.
mccarty
prior
to
that,
at
his
so-called
on-the-scene
setting.
referring,
if
i
might,
the
origin
of
this
argument
to
the
statements
made
in
response
to
the
alcohol
influence
report
form--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--they
permitted
the
later
statements
to
be...
they
kept
the
later
statements
out,
your
honor.
they
permitted
the
statements
made
at
the
scene
to
come
in.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
i
do.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
no,
i
don't.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
i
agree
in
part;
then
i
disagree
in
part.
our
position
is
very
simply
this:
that
the
sixth
circuit's
decision,
as
it
pertains
to
the
inadmissibility
of
the
statements
made
during
custodial
interrogation,
should
be
affirmed.
our
problem
with
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
is
simply
that
their
language
would
preclude
any
types
of
statements
made
at
the
scene.
now,
my
concern,
your
honor,
is
that--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
we
do
not
contest
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
trial
court's
ruling
as
it
pertained
to
the
in-custody
statements.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that
part
of
the
decision,
however,
your
honor,
only
pertained
to
the
in-custody
statements.
we
do
not
feel
the
necessity
of
cross-petitioning
because
of
the
fact
that
that
ruling
was
not
part
of
the
actual
judgment.
it
was
our
understanding--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--yes,
but
it
wasn't
part
of
the
judgment.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
the
same
judgment
as
it
pertains
to
the
in-custody
statements
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
correct.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
the
crucial
thing--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--that's
correct.
but
yet
again,
the
point
that
we
are
making
is
it
was
not
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit.
therefore,
we
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
cross-petition.
in
any
event,
back
to
my
point
that
i
was
making
concerning
the
alcohol
influence
report
form,
since
it
was
the
crucial
part
of
this
case...
that
report
was
prepared
during
custodial
interrogation.
and
be
no
mistake
about
the
alcohol
influence
report
form.
that
is
a
document
that
is
designed
by
law
enforcement
officers
to
elicit
information
that
will
be
used
to
prosecute
the
suspect
at
trial.
there
is
no
other
way
to
explain
it.
that's
been
the
way
it
is
in
ohio
for
years,
and
it
will
continue
to
be
that
way.
if
the
court
has
had
the
opportunity
to
review
the
second
page
of
that
document,
it
is
clear
that
what
the
officer
is
attempting
to
do
while
engaging
in
the
custodial
interrogation
is
to
find
out
where
that
person
was,
how
long
he
had
been
there,
how
much
he
had
to
drink.
the
question
is
posed:
are
you
under
the
influence
of
alcohol?
how
much
have
had
you
drink?
do
you
have
any
defects,
physically,
and
so
forth?
all
these
things
are
designed
to
give
the
prosecution
information
that
will
be
used
to
prosecute
the
suspect.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
r.
william
meeks
there
are
parts
of
it
that
can
be,
at
the
beginning.
name,
address,
and
so
forth.
the
rest
of
it--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--that
may
be
the
purpose,
your
honor--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--that
may
be.
but
i'm
saying
in
practical
experience,
that
document
is
to
prosecute.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
i
may
stand
corrected.
there
may
be
a
small
part
that
may
not
be.
but
by
and
large,
it's
all
used
solely
for
the
purposes
of
prosecuting
the
suspect.
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
stipulated
that
my
client
was
in
custody
at
the
time,
that
he
was
taken
to
jail,
and
that
these
comments
made
on
the
alcohol
influence
report
form
were
made
in
custody.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that's
correct.
they
felt
that
they
were
not
bound
to
follow
that
stipulation.
i
wouldn't
say
they
rejected
the
stipulation,
only
that
they
did
not
feel
bound
by
it.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
perhaps
so,
your
honor,
but
nevertheless,
they
found,
without
any
hesitation,
to
my
mind
anyway,
that
at
the
time
the
alcohol
influence
report
form
was
filled
out,
he
was
in
custody.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
at
the
jail.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that's
correct.
it
seems,
as
far
as
respondent's
position
is
concerned,
that
comments
made
at
the
jail,
in
custody,
is
a
fairly
cut
and
dried
situation;
that
miranda
should
be
applied.
there
is
no
legitimate
reason
for
miranda
not
to
be
applied
to
a
custody
situation.
the
petitioner
has
advanced
a
lot
of
different
reasons,
indicating
that
miranda
was
not
designed
to
attach
to
custodial
interrogation
involving
traffic
matters;
yet,
there
is
no
real
distinction
as
to
why
it
shouldn't.
the
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
well,
this
is
a
traffic
misdemeanor;
it's
not
a
felony.
the
point
is,
is
that
if
we're
going
to
be
drawing
distinctions
between
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
some
states
have
felonies,
where
other
states
have
misdemeanors
for
identical
conduct.
if
we're
going
to
use
a
breakdown
on
the
basis
of
felony-misdemeanor
line,
it
would
be
totally
unworkable.
miranda
itself
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
interrogation,
not
upon
the
nature
of
the
offense.
and
even
though
miranda
itself
and
the
cases
that
were
collected
at
the
same
time
were
certainly
felony
cases,
there
has
been
no
language
in
any
of
those
decisions
designed
to
limit
custodial
interrogation
to
felony
cases
exclusively.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
it
did.
station
house
interrogation.
however,
in
cases
subsequent
to
that,
chief
justice,
there
were
cases
involving
custodial
interrogation
in
mr.
orozco's
home.
there
was
custodial
interrogation
of
mr.
mathis
when
he
was
doing
time
down
in
a
state
prison
for
something
unrelated.
those
things
occurred
in
familiar
environments,
and
it
was
not
long--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--it
was
custody,
no
question
about
it.
and
the
court
so
found.
however,
the
point
is,
is
that
when
mr.
carty
went
to
the
franklin
county
jail,
there
was
no
serious
question
about
the
fact
that
mr.
mccarty
was
just
as
much
in
custody
as
mr.
miranda
was
or
mr.
westover
was,
or
any
of
the
other
situations
this
court
addressed
many
years
ago.
more
to
the
second
part
of
our
argument
in
this
case,
we
have
suggested
that
the
sixth
circuit's
language
limiting
the
inadmissibility
to
the
custodial
statements
made
at
the
scene
would
be
too
limiting.
we
have
made
the
suggestion
and
we
have
urged
this
court
to,
in
fact,
adopt
a
ruling
that
would
exclude
from
evidence
statements
made
even
at
the
scene.
and
we
are
aware
of
the
language
of
miranda
that
permits
general
on-the-scene
questioning,
and
this
relates
to
part
two
of
our
position
in
this
case.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
adopt
a
ruling
that
would
preclude
law
enforcement
officers
from
engaging
in
custodial
questioning
if,
in
fact,
custodial
questioning
occurs
at
the
time
that
the
motorist
is
stopped.
and
we
have
adopted
a
test
that
we
think
properly
puts--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
very
much
so.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
no,
sir.
i
think
that
that
decision,
if
my
reading
of
that
decision
is
accurate,
is
formal
arrest
or
the
functional
equivalent.
and
in
this
situation,
functional
equivalent
would
mean,
in
our
opinion,
when
an
officer
stops
a
vehicle
or
car--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
respectfully,
for
this
reason.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
i
don't
suggest
to
you
that
miranda
is
applicable
to
a
terry
stop.
i
would
disagree
with
you,
your
honor,
if
you
are
indicating
that
the
stop,
in
our
case...
mccarty...
was
a
terry-type
stop.
we
have
submitted,
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear...
that
this
was
a
stop
based
upon
probable
cause,
not
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
if
the
probable
cause--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--if
the
probable
cause
combines
with
custody.
and
a
custody
definition,
as
applied
in
miranda,
was
custody
or
otherwise
deprived
of
freedom
in
a
significant
way.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
we
are
not
suggesting
that
a
terry
stop
be
the
predicate
for
further
interrogation
in
a
custody
setting.
we
are
saying
that
when
a
person
is
deprived
of
his
freedom,
as
a
motorist
is
when
they
are
stopped
on
the
freeway,
and
when
that
officer
then
has
probable
cause...
the
type
of
probable
cause,
frankly,
that
this
court
required
be
utilized
in
taking
somebody
to
the
station
house
in
dunaway...
then
at
that
point
in
time,
that
officer
must
give
that
driver
his
miranda
rights.
the
reason
is
simple,
your
honor,
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
the
general
on-the-scene
questioning
is
permitted,
but
it's
no
longer
general
on-the-scene
questioning
when
that
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
driver
has
committed
the
crime.
the
generality
aspect
of--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you,
with
all
due
respect,
that
a
person
driving
a
car,
whose
locomotion
is
stopped
on
a
freeway,
who
is
not
permitted
to
leave
and
is
going
to
be
questioned
by
an
officer--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
when
an
officer,
as
in
our
case,
observes
erratic
driving,
that
officer
at
that
point
has
probable
cause
to
believe
a
variety
of
traffic
offenses
has
been
committed.
that's
more,
with
all
due
respect,
than
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
your
honor,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
we
are
in
a
position
where,
if
a
suspect
is
in
the
situation
of
either
being
in
formal
custody
or
its
functional
equivalent,
and
combined
with
that
the
arresting
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
crime
has
been
committed,
at
that
point
in
time,
if
he
wishes
to
interrogate...
only
if
he
wishes
to
interrogate...
then
miranda
warnings
should
be
given.
those
three
criteria
must
be
met.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
as
far
as
the
stipulation
in
this
case
is
concerned,
your
honor,
the
officer...
once
he
stopped
the
vehicle
after
he
made
the
observations...
was
satisfied
that
that
man
was
going
to
jail.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
he
did
not
articulate
that,
no.
but
his
freedom
to
leave
the
scene
was
terminated
once
his
car
was
stopped
and
once
the
officer
approached
the
vehicle
and
was
able,
then,
to
pursue
his
probable
cause
findings,
beyond
simply
reckless
driving,
into
potential
drunk
driving
charge.
and
it's
our
position,
frankly,
your
honor,
that
at
that
point
we
have
the
functional
equivalent
of
being
in
custody.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
no,
sir.
the
actual
language
isn't
important,
because
what
we're
suggesting
is
an
objective
test.
we
are
not
here
seeking
a
focus
test
or
any
other
test
that
this
court
has
already
repudiated
for
determining
custody.
rather,
we
are
looking
at
an
objective
standard...
when
a
reasonable
person
would
feel
that
they
are
no
longer
free
to
leave
the
scene.
and
we
submit,
your
honor,--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--in
most
situations,
i
agree
with
you.
but
that
doesn't
mean
interrogation
can
follow.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
the
only
time
that
interrogation--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--not
exclusively,
no.
the
traffic
stop
based
upon
probable
cause
has
to
be
coupled
with
the
type
of
interrogation
contemplated
by
rhode
island
v.
innis.
in
other
words,
if
that
officer
merely
wants
to
inquire
on
basic
background
information
of
that
driver,
no,
sir;
he
doesn't
have
to
give
miranda
warnings.
but
if
that
officer
wants
to
approach
the
driver
of
that
car
who
he
has
stopped,
and
say
i
want
to
know
where
you've
been,
what
time
is
it,
how
much
have
you
had
to
drink,
then
those
answers
are
reasonably
likely
to
incriminate
the
person...
that's
interrogation.
excuse
me.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
if
i...
there
was
a
broken
tail
light,
your
honor.
i
lost
the
last
of
your
question.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
sir?
mr.
r.
william
meeks
at
that
point
in
time,
there
is
no
miranda
called
for,
because
the
man
is
not
being
interrogated.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
he
could
interrogate
him
without
the
miranda
warning.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
if
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
arrest
that
person,
and
he
wants
to
engage
in
questioning,
it
would
be
proper
for
him,
prior
to
interrogating
him,
to
give
him
miranda
warnings.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
that
would
be
out
of
bounds
because
it
would
be
an
answer
that's
reasonably
likely
to
be
incriminating.
it
would
be
interrogation
in
our
view,
under
the
definition
of
rhode
island
v.
innis.
the
officer's
observations
are
all
admissible.
we
don't
contest
that.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
or
a
suppression
hearing.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
well,
your
honor,
frankly,
what
we're
trying
to
establish
is,
so
that
there
is
some--
mr.
r.
william
meeks
--it's
precisely
that
that
we're
trying
to
avoid.
we
are
saying
that
when
a
motor
vehicle
is
stopped
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
based
upon
probable
cause,
and
that
officer
wishes
to
engage
in
more
than
general
on-the-scene
interrogation,
then
they
must
precede
that
interrogation
by
giving
miranda
warnings.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
william
meeks
oh,
no.
if
i
misspoke,
i
apologize.
that's
not
what
i
intended.
but
the
purpose
of
all
this,
frankly,
is
to
provide
a
situation
where
there
will
be
an
easily
understandable
rule,
because
if
we
don't
have
something
like
this,
then
what
we're
going
to
do
is,
in
dwi
cases,
for
instance,
the
officers
will
just
merely
get
the
people
at
the
scene,
interrogate
them
at
the
window,
and
just
simply
take
the
station
house
interrogation
would
be
precluded,
and
move
that
to
the
car.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
is
that
kind
of
situation
that
the
officers
would
then
engage
in
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
way
of
circumventing
miranda.
and
when
an
officer
does
that,
they
are
still
dealing
with
a
person
who
clearly
is
in
custody
within
an
objective
standard
that
any
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle
would
feel,
had
they
been
stopped
on
a
freeway.
concerning
the
matter
of
harmless
error,
i'd
like
to
address
that
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
that
i
have.
judge
wellford
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
the
court
below
indicated
that
he
would
not
overturn
the
lower
court
ruling
because
he
felt
that
the
statements
made
at
the
scene
were
redundant
with
the
statements
made
later
at
the
station
house.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case;
that
when
mr.
mccarty
was
questioned
at
the
station
house,
he
admitted
the
primary
aspect
of
this
entire
case,
the
fundamental
issue,
that
being
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
alcohol.
that
admission
was
not
made
at
the
scene.
moreover,
at
the
station
house
it
was
clear
that
mr.
mccarty
indicated
to
the
officer
that
he
had
a
limp,
he
had
a
bad
back,
which
can
explain,
quite
obviously,
the
problems
he
had
walking.
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
only
slept
for
an
hour
the
night
before.
all
of
those
factors
weigh
against
the
harmless
error
aspect
that
is
pursued
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
your
honor,
the
failure
to
raise
that
issue
in
the
court
below
should
preclude
it
here.
nevertheless,
if
that
issue
is
reached,
it's
pretty
much
without
question
that
there
was
not
harmless
error
in
this
case;
that
ample
defense
was
available
to
mr.
mccarty
and
would
certainly
have
been
much
more
defensible
had
his
inadmissible
statements
been
kept
out
of
the
record,
as
the
sixth
circuit
ruled
they
should
have
been.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
that
concludes
argument.
