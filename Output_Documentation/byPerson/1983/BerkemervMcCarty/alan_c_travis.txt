mr.
alan
c.
travis
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
restate
the
question
presented
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
believe
it
can
be
restated
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
the
first
part
of
the
question
should
be,
in
my
judgment,
whether
routine
highway
traffic
safety
stops
involve
the
type
of
custodial
interrogation
which
was
a
concern
of
the
miranda
court;
that
is,
the
routine,
everyday,
highway
traffic
stops.
second...
the
second
portion
of
our
argument...
involves
a
question
of
whether
there
can
be
a
reasoned
application
of
the
judicially
crafted
prophylactic
rule
of
miranda
in
the
case
of
the
impaired
driver,
a
person
charged
with
the
offense
of
driving
while
impaired
by
alcohol
or
other
chemical
substances.
the
salient
facts,
if
i
may
recapitulate
them
briefly,
indicate
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
observed
driving
on
an
interstate
highway
by
a
state
highway
patrol
trooper
on
routine
traffic
safety
patrol.
he
observed
mr.
mccarty's
car
weaving
back
and
forth
within
his
expected
lane
of
travel,
and
followed
him
for
some
two
miles.
after
following
him
for
two
miles,
he
caused
the
car
to
be
stopped,
and
asked
mr.
mccarty
to
exit
the
vehicle.
the
trooper
described
mr.
mccarty
as
falling.
he
was
unable
to
stand
unaided,
and
in
his
later
report
indicated
that
he
had
to
be
"held
up
from
falling".
he
attempted...
i'm
sorry...
at
that
point...
and,
by
the
way,
each
of
these
facts
were
entered
before
the
municipal
court
by
way
of
stipulation
between
the
parties,
rather
than
an
evidentiary
hearing.
at
the
point
that
he
realized
the
man
could
not
stand
on
his
own
two
feet
unaided,
trooper
williams
concluded
that
he
would
charge
mr.
mccarty
with
a
traffic
offense,
and
the
parties
stipulated
at
that
point
his
freedom
to
leave
the
scene
was
terminated.
trooper
williams
then
attempted
to
have
mr.
mccarty
perform
certain
field
sobriety
tests
i
think
the
court
will
recognize
are
traditional
tests
of
balancing,
touching
one's
nose,
walking
a
straight
line,
and
so
forth.
but,
as
the
alcohol
influence
report
form
shows...
and
that's
in
the
appendix
at
page
2
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
is...
mr.
mccarty
was
falling,
and
therefore
the
tests
could
not
be
completed.
the
trooper
noted
that
mr.
mccarty
spoke
with
very
slurred
speech...
he
was
very
hard
to
understand...
and
at
this
point,
asked
mr.
mccarty
if
he
had
been
drinking.
mr.
mccarty
said
he
had
had
two
beers
and
had
smoked
"several
joints
of
marijuana
a
short
time
before.
"
at
that
point,
the
trooper
formally
arrested
mr.
mccarty,
and
under
a
state
implied
consent
chemical
test
statute,
transported
him
to
a
facility,
which
in
this
case
was
the
franklin
county
ohio
jail
for
a
chemical
test
of
his
blood
alcohol
content.
at
that
point,
mr.
mccarty
took
the
test
and
the
intoxilyzer...
that
the
court
has
heard
quite
a
bit
about
in
the
last
case...
the
intoxilyzer
indicated
a
zero
blood
alcohol
content.
at
that
point,
mr.
mccarty
presumably
still
not
being
able
to
function,
was
not
released
from
the
franklin
county
jail
facility,
and
the
officer
began
to
fill
out
what
is
known
as
the
alcohol
influence
report
form.
again,
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
both
in
its
original
state
and,
at
the
suggestion
of
the
clerk,
in
a
typewritten
facsimile
for
ease
of
reading.
the
trooper
filled
out
the
report
form
which
is
a
pro
forma
line
item,
fill-in-the-blanks
form,
if
you
will.
it
is
a
statement
on
the
front
page,
as
the
court
will
note,
which
recounts
the
date
and
time
of
the
offense,
the
trooper's
observations
of
the
driving
offense
that
he
had
witnessed
the
man
traveling
for
two
miles
and
so
forth,
could
not
stand
on
his
feet.
it
recounted
his
statements
at
the
scene
of
the
traffic
offense...
excuse
me...
to
the
effect
that
he
had
two
beers
and
smoked
several
marijuana
cigarettes.
and
then
on
the
back
of
the
form,
as
the
court
will
note,
the
trooper
inquired
of
mr.
mccarty
as
to
whether
he
knew
what
day
it
was,
what
date
it
was,
what
time
it
was,
and
the
various
responses
are
down
there.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor.
this
is
on
the
alcohol
influence
report
form,
which
was
filled
out--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--no,
not
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
as
he
was
making
out
the
report,
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
he
asked
him
those
questions.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
this
was...
in
terms
of
time,
i
can't
say
exactly,
justice
brennan.
it
was
after
he
was
transported
from
the
highway
to
the
breathalyzer
test
and
immediately
after
he
tested
point
zero.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no
blood
alcohol
in
the
intoxilyzer.
in
other
words,
when
mr.
mccarty
blew
into
the
tube,
the
machine
said
this
man
has
not
been
drinking
alcohol.
but
obviously
he
was
unable
to
stand
on
his
feet.
and...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
there
may
have
been
some
other
reason,
and
the
reason
given
by--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--that
he
had
been
smoking
illicit
drugs
in
this
case,
or
could
in
any
other
case,
for
that
matter--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--that's
actually
the
reverse
side
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
it's

joint
appendix,
page
2.
on
the
front
of
the
form,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
yes.
under
his
handwriting
specimen
at
the
bottom,
the
court
will
note
that
there
is
a
bottom
place
noted
"remarks".
the
top
portion
of
that
is
the
police
officer's
or
state
highway
patrol
trooper's
handwritten
notes.
"the
defendant
stated
that
he
had
smoked
two
joints.

--the
trooper's
spelling
is
somewhat
inaccurate...
11:30

["]
from
there
on,
that
is
mr.
mccarty's
handwritten
statement.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
i
would
invite
the
court
to
observe
that,
yes.
he
says,
no...
and
i
will
translate...

signed
his
name,
richard
mccarty.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
he
repeated
what
he
had
said
at
the
scene
of
the
traffic
stop,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
plus
the
other.
and
the
other,
i
should
add,
was
in
response
to
the
officer's
request
to
write
down
that
fact,
because
he
apparently
had
said
that
during
the
filling
out
of
the
alcohol
influence
report
form.
the
parties
stipulated...
and,
of
course,
there's
a
record...
that
no
miranda
warnings
or
prophylactic
advice
were
given
at
any
time
to
mr.
mccarty
either
at
the
scene
of
the
traffic
stop
or
later
after
the
implied
consent
test
and
the
filling
out
of
this...
what
we
call
a
line
item
pro
forma
alcohol
influence
report
form.
as
to
the
traffic
stop,
the
first
portion
of
what
i
restated
as
being
the
question
before
the
court,
simply
stated,
in
the
petitioner's
judgment,
routine
traffic
highway
safety
stops
are
not
the
type
of
custodial
interrogation
that
was
envisioned
by
the
miranda
court.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
am
not
certain,
your
honor,
what
the
sixth
circuit
panel
decision
indicated.
if
the
court
will
note--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i
am
again
not
certain,
your
honor.
as
judge
wellford
indicates
in
dissent,
he
indicates
that
he
is
not
certain
what
the
majority
has
stated.
and
the
majority
itself,
after
recounting
that
procedurally
mr.
mccarty
had
moved
consistently
through
all
courts,
that
all
of
his
statements
when
in
custody
should
be
suppressed,
stated:
"we
agree".
they
then
went
on--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i
don't
know
that
they
stated
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that's
what
judge
wellford
indicates
in
his
dissent
was
troubling
him.
he
is
not--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--well,
i--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--the
is
the
way
i
first
read
it,
and
i
will
confess
to
the
court,
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
i
am
still
not
certain
what
the
said.
we
felt
that
it
was
important
to
litigate
the
issue
before
the
court
because,
no.
1,
even
if
that
is
correct,
they
are
still
in
conflict
with
the
fourth
circuit
in
clay
against
riddle.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
yes.
that
is
the
second
portion
of
our
argument,
and
i
will
actually
conclude
very
briefly
on
the
first
portion
by
simply
stating
what
i
started
out
to
say.
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
type
of
custodial
interrogation
that
is
the
routine,
day-to-day,
traffic
safety
stop
on
miranda.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
on
the
scene.
and
i'll
conclude
that
portion
right
now.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
yes,
justice
stevens.
again,
when
i
first
read
the
opinion,
i
had
some
difficulty
with
it.
however,
what
the
court
seemed
to
do
down
there
was
reject
what
the
parties
had
stipulated.
throughout,
the
parties
had
stipulated
a
form
of
custodial
status,
and
the
question
was
whether
this
was
the
type
of
custodial
status
and
the
type
of
custody,
that
is,
and
the
type
of
interrogation
that
the
miranda
court
was
concerned
with.
what
the
majority
below
did,
in
our
opinion,
was
reject
a
stipulation
of
historical
fact,
and
thus
not
reach
the
issue
that
the
parties
were
litigating.
that
is
why
we
have...
and
i
believe
it
is
footnote
3...
that
the
parties
had
stipulated
custody
as
the
term
is
ordinarily
considered,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
the
type
of
custody
that
the
miranda
court
was
concerned
with.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no.
there
was
a
stay,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
there
was
a
stay
when
he
filed
both
in
the
state
appellate
process
and
then
in
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
it
was
what
we
call
a
no
contest
plea,
and
under
state
law
he
specifically
reserves
pretrial
rulings,
the
appealability.
so
he
did
not
concede
in
the
sense
of
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
the
repeat
of
the
questions
on
the
back
side
of
the
alcohol
influence
report
form,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
a
joint
exhibit,
part
of
the
stipulation.
as
i
said,
the
parties
did
not
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
it
was
joint
exhibit
1
in
the
franklin
county
municipal
court,
the
traffic
court.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
as
judge
wellford...
well,
as
the
majority...
if
i
am
incorrect
in
my
concern
about
the
panel
decision
and
that
the
panel
decision
actually
ruled
that
the
statements
made
on
the
scene
of
the
traffic
stop
were
admissible,
i
would
agree.
secondly,
judge
wellford
stated
that
he
would
hold,
even
if
there
were
a
full-blown
custody
at
that
scene,
that
any
situation
involving
a
routine
traffic
stop,
he
would
admit
those.
he
also
indicated
that
the
statements
which
the
majority
found
objectionable,
as
not
having
been
given
following
miranda
advice,
should
be
considered
harmless
error
because
they
were
repetitious...
essentially
repetitious...
excuse
me.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
we
have
included
that,
although
that
is
not
the
prime
thrust
of
our
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
it
was
litigated
in
the
sense...
not
litigated,
not
raised
by
the
party,
the
state...
but
was
decided,
in
my
judgment,
by
the
dissent
specifically
addressing
it
and
implicit
in
the
majority,
the
majority
rejecting
it.
therefore,
i
would
say
that
it
had
been
ruled
upon
and
thus
preserved.
the
primary
thrust
of
the
second
portion
of
our
question
presented
to
the
court
this
morning...
i
will
restate
it
just
briefly
here...
is
whether
there
can
be
a
reasoned
application,
a
rational
application
of
the
judicially
crafted
prophylactic
rule
of
miranda
in
the
case
of
an
individual
arrested
for
impaired
driving.
and
i
would
stress
the
term
"impaired
driving".
we
are
talking
not
simply
about
drunken
driving,
but
drunken
and
drug
driving.
in
this
instance,
we
suggest
that
there
are
unique
reasons
why
the
prophylactic
rule
was
not
applicable
in
this
case,
in
this
type
of
case.
the
simplest
way
i
can
present
this
position,
i
believe,
is
to
ask
the
court
to
compare...
or
i
will
compare,
rather...
what
would
happen
in
any
other
instance
where
a
detective,
in
the
traditional
sense
of
an
investigation
of
a
criminal
act,
had
a
person
in
custody...
we
are
talking
now
about
custodial
interrogation...
and
he
wishes
to
interrogate
that
person?
one
of
the
first
things
any
conscientious
detective
will
do
is
make
a
determination,
factually,
of
the
ability,
the
cognitive
ability
of
this
individual
whom
he
wishes
to
question,
the
cognitive
ability
to
be
aware
of
his
so-called
miranda
advice,
miranda
warnings,
to
have
the
cognitive
ability
to
appreciate
them,
to
fully
understand
them,
and
then,
of
course,
under
johnson
against
zerbst,
for
the
later
court
hearing,
whether
there
would
be
a
knowing,
intelligent,
voluntary
waiver
of
those
rights.
the
difficulty
with
the
impaired
driver
and
the
uniqueness
of
this
offense
is
that
the
very
preliminary
questions
that
any
conscientious
detective
would
ask
are
precluded
if
miranda
is
applicable,
the
conscientious
detective
would
inquire
of
the
individual's
age,
educational
background,
their
ability
to
read
and
write,
and
almost
universally,
i
submit,
whether
the
person
had
been
drinking,
whether
the
person
had
taken
any
drugs;
if
they've
been
drinking,
when,
how
much,
and
so
forth.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
no.
i'm
suggesting
that
if
he
wishes
to
interview
the
person,
under
the
traditional
situation
of
custodial
interrogation...
i'm
talking
about
a
detective
who
wishes
to
interview
an
arrested
person
who
is
being
held
in
the
police
station,
who--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--yes.
i'm
speaking
in
the
hypothetical
sense
that
is
a
comparison
to
this
case,
that
any
such
detective
would,
of
necessity,
if
he's
conscientious,
make
a
determination
of
whether
the
person
had
the
ability
to
appreciate,
understand,
and
knowingly,
intelligently,
and
voluntarily
waive
his
miranda
rights.
that
would
include
the
very
questions
which
miranda
would
preclude
in
this
case,
in
the
case...
the
unique
case...
of
the
impaired
driver;
that
is,
have
you
been
drinking?
hae
you
taken
any
drugs?
have
you
taken
any
medication?
the
attempt
to
learn
whether
he
can
cognitively
understand
and
appreciate
his
rights.
that
anomalous
result,
i
think,
counsels
against
extension
of
miranda
in
this
unique
situation.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
are
we
talking
about
the
hypothetical
of
some
other
offense,
not
the
drunk
driving
or
impaired
driving?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that's
true.
but
my
point,
your
honor,
is
not
whether
or
not
miranda
advice
can
be
given
or
cannot
be
given.
i'm
saying
that
at
this
point...
my
hypothetical
is
that
a
conscientious
detective
would
go
into
those
questions,
but
in
the
case
of
the
impaired
driver,
application
of
miranda
would
preclude
those
preliminary
questions.
he
could
not
ask
the
preliminary
question,
have
you
been
drinking
or
taking
drugs,
to
determine
whether
the
man
understood
his
rights,
because
they
go
immediately
to
the
heart
of
the
offense.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
if
he
did
this,
if
he
filled
all
this
information
out
at
the
scene.
but
i
think
one
of
the
things
that
the
state
law
does,
and
does...
i
would
assume,
frankly,
that
it
does
so
in
virtually
any
state...
i
think
all
states
have
an
implied
consent
test...
is
recognize
that
there
is
proof
positive,
or
essentially
proof
positive,
in
a
breathalyzer.
one
of
the
things
that
the
presidential
commission
on
drunk
driving
recommended
was
move
the
person
into
the
process
of
testing,
booking,
and
put
the
officer
back
on
the
street.
he
could
do
a
full-blown
field
investigation
with
this
report
form.
he
could
sit
there
on
an
on-scene
basis
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
inquire.
i
don't
think
it's
a
practical--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that's
correct,
and
that's--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--well,
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
o'connor,
but
i
would
still
have
to
say
that...
and
this
may
be
begging
the
question,
begging
your
honor's
question...
but
it
would
still
seem
to
me
that
before
there
can
be
a
rational
application
of
the
prophylactic
rule
of
miranda
in
this
case,
there
must
be
some
way
that
the
officer
can
rationally
determine
these
things,
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
questioning
at
all.
and,
as
we--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--assuming
that,
as
in
this
case,
there
was
a
statement
made
on
the
scene.
if
there
were
not
this
statement
made
on--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i
can't
tell
you
that
in
the
typical
case
there
are
always
statements
and
always
admissions
made
on
the
scene
of
every
traffic
stop,
and
i
doubt
seriously,
your
honor,
that
there
are.
i
doubt
seriously
that
every--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--it
may
be,
but
it
is
untypical,
if
you
will,
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
breathalyzer
or
indication
of
alcohol
in
this
case.
and
in
that
instance,
that--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
alan
c.
travis
they
don't
at
all,
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
they
don't,
to
my
knowledge
at
all.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
it
certainly
could
be
done.
and,
in
candor,
some
other
states
do.
the
amicus
brief...
and
respondent
has
pointed
out,
there
are
various
court
decisions
in
the
state
courts
either
saying
yes
or
no,
yea
or
nay.
i
still
say,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--well,
i
don't
see
what
value
there
is
either.
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
can
barely
stand
up--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i
would
agree,
justice
stevens,
in
general.
my
concern
is...
and
what
we
have
attempted
to
present
in
the
second
portion
of
our
argument
here...
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
person
impaired
by
either
alcohol
or
chemicals,
and
specifically
this
fact
pattern,
for
example,
if
you...
and
i'm
moving
a
little
bit
farther
along
in
the
report
form.
when
a
person
is
in
custody,
they
are
entitled
to
some
reasonable
degree
of
care.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
although
not
directly
identically,
words
of
booking,
attendant
to
arrest,
and
so
forth,
this
may
very
well
be
more
in
that
line
than
it
is
in
the
line
of
interrogation.
for
example,
in
this
instance,
mr.
mccarty
exhibits
what
we
would
describe
as
rather
bizarre
behavior.
he
was
unable
to
stand.
his
speech
was
extraordinarily
slurred.
the
officer,
other
than
the
fact...
and
i
am
now
in
a
hypothetical
situation
to
the
extent
that
other
than
he
made
some
statement
on
the
scene...
when
he
tests
zero
on
the
breathalyzer,
there
is
an
indication
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
man,
but
there
is
an
indication
it
is
not
alcohol-induced.
it
could
be
virtually
anything.
it
could
be
insulin
shock.
it
could
be
a
stroke.
it
could
be
a
combination
of
the
synergistic
effect
of
several
drugs.
perhaps
he
was
on
a
minor
tranquilizer.
i'm
suggesting
that
these
line
item
pro
forma
inquiries
are
more
in
that
nature,
and
not
in
the
nature
of
the
traditional
interrogation,
and
that
if
the
person
is
in
that
state,
it
is
at
best
difficult
to
make
any
determination
that
they
had
a
knowing,
intelligent,
awareness
of
their
rights,
even
if
they
were
given.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
it's
not...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i
don't
know
that
i
am
suggesting
that
he
have
some
medical
diagnosis
decision.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
well,
it's
certainly
a
possibility.
but
what
we
have
suggested
to
the
court,
and
what
i
think
that
would
do
would
be
to
throw
the
situation,
if
you
will,
back
into
the
voluntariness
question
on
the
statement
itself;
that
in
almost
any
instance,
certainly
in
mr.
mccarty's
instance,
there
is
question
of
whether
or
not
he
would
have
a
voluntary
statement
in
the
traditional
sense.
i
think
that's
essentially
what
we're
arguing
before
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that
would
be
one
portion.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
i'm
certain
there
is,
and--
mr.
alan
c.
travis
--i
would
say
that
that's
a
significant
portion.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
that
portion
of
the
quote
from
miranda
does
indicate
that.
and
yet,
as
respondent
points
out,
there
is
additional
language
in
there
that
is
not
totally
clear
as
to
whether
it
relates
directly
to
the
person
who
is
the
suspect
in
the
case.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
possible
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
c.
travis
only
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
sixth
circuit
panel
opinion,
i
would
simply
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
court
did
order,
that
is,
the
sixth
circuit
did
order
the
writ
and
a
retrial.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
on
retrial,
without
some
clarification
here,
we
would
not
know
what
to
tell
the
state
trial
court
was
admissible
or
not
admissible.
as
to
the
felony-misdemeanor
line,
i
think
the
court
will
note
that
we
have
never
pressed
that.
we
have
never
pressed
that
in
any
of
the...
in
the
petition
or
the
brief,
other
than
the
general
question
of
whether
or
not
the
miranda
doctrine
should
be
applied
in
the
case
of
misdemeanor
traffic
offenses.
we've
never
suggested
that
it's
simply
not
applicable
because
it
is,
in
fact,
a
misdemeanor.
and,
last,
although
we,
of
course,
differ
on
it,
we
would
urge
that
if
the
court
does
disagree
with
the
second
portion
of
our
argument,
that
it
was
effectively
ruled
upon
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
that
the
doctrine
of
harmless
error
should
be
applicable.
mr.
mccarty's
condition
prior
to
the
so-called
alcohol
influence
report
form
as
such,
and
if
his
handwriting
is
impaired,
which
is
nontestimonial,
i
would
submit
would
make
any
error
in
this
case
harmless
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt.
thank
you
very
much.
