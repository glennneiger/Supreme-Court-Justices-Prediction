ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
straightforward
case
of
statutory
construction
that
is
governed
by
the
plain
meaning
rule.
there
is
nothing
the
least
bit
ambiguous
about
the
statutory
language
even
if
there
were
the
legislative
history
and
the
policy
reasons
that
lead
congress
to
enact
the
various
exemptions
to
the
tort
claims
act.
all
support
the
court
of
appeals
construction--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
sir.
turning
first
to
the
statutory
language,
the
exemption
in
section
2680(c)
is
about
as
broad
as
anything
congress
could
have
written.
congress
retained
sovereign
immunity
for
any
claim
arising
in
respect
to
the
detention
of
goods
held
by
customs
officers.
petitioner's
property
in
this
case
was
seized
and
detained
because
the
customs
service
suspected
that
he
brought
it
into
the
country
in
violation
of
the
customs
laws
and
clearly--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
is
our
position,
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
is
just
nothing
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
or
in
its
grammatical
construction
that
supports
a
distinction
between
the
fact
of
detention
alone,
such
a
delay
damages,
and
damages
that
happen
to
property
while
it
is
in
the
possession
or
while
it
is
being
detained
by
the
customs
service.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
the
court
were
to
construe
the
language
as
allowing
that
distinction,
it
would
simply
be
reading
something
into
the
language
that
is
not
there.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
that
purports
to
distinguish
among
different
types
of
harm
that
might
occur
in
relation
to
a
detention.
in
both
situations--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--justice
rehnquist,
one
petitioner's
main
arguments
was
that
there
is
some
special
significance
to
the
phrase
"in
respect
of",
and
that
somehow
limits
detention
to
damages
caused
by
the
fact
of
detention
alone.
and,
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
also
relied
on
that
same
distinction.
but,
in
fact,
throughout
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act,
congress
described
this
exemption
as
barring
claims
arising
out
of
the
detention
of
property.
congress
interchangeably
used
in
the
legislative
history
in
the
statute
the
phrase
"in
respect
of"
and
the
description
"arising
out
of".
so,
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
by
that
interchangeable
use
that
congress
could
not
have
intended,
or
it
would
have
said
so,
to
be
attaching
some
special
limited
significance
to
the
phrase
"in
respect
of".
whenever
congress
described
the
exemption,
it
used
the
broad
language
that
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
found
sufficient
to
bar
petitioner's
claim.
just
to
repeat,
there
is
simply
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
ever
thought
about
making
the
sort
of
precise
distinction
you
are
talking
about.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
there
is,
but
it
is
negated
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
congress
in
every
committee
report
described
this
exemption,
which
is
phrased
"in
respect
of"
as
barring
claims
arising
out
of
the
detention
of
property.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
or
arising
out
of
or--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--or
from,
that
is
correct.
congress...
in
the
legislative
history--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
there
isn't,
your
honor,
but
it
is
clear,
we
think,
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
no
special
intention
in
mind
when
it
used
the
phrase
"in
respect
of".
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
legislative
history
for
one
cause
having
"in
respect
of"
and
other
having
"arising
out
of",
but
the
most
logical
one
is
that
these
exemptions
were
not
all
enacted
at
the
same
time
or
by
the
same
people.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
them
use
"from".
"arising
out
of"
is
the
most
common.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
think...
i
think
"in
respect
of"
is
virtually
identical
to
"arising
out
of"
and
i
think
it
is
quite
a
hypertechnical
dictionary
construction
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
"in
respect
of",
without
regard
to
the
legislative
history,
really
has
this
special,
limited
meaning.
but,
if
the
court
disagrees,
the
minute
you
turn
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
apparent
that
congress
didn't
view
there
to
be
any
distinction
between
those
two
phrases
because--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
would
depend
on
the
facts,
but
it
is
possible
that
it
would
be
beyond...
it
would
be
possible
that
it
would
not
be
covered
by
the
tort
claims
act
at
all.
the
agent
might
be
acting
beyond
the
scope
of
his
employment.
it
might
be
one
of
the
intentional
torts
that
is
exempted
by
another
section
of
the
tort
claims
act.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
he
obviously
would
be
subject
to
civil
suit
in
any
event
just
for
negligence
or
for
intentional
damage.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
well,
the
united
states
only
generally
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
the
acts
of
its
employees
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
so,
if
you
have
as
a
hypothetical
a
customs
agent
who
just
comes
to
work
one
day
and
decides
to
smash
every
fifth
object
that
passes
by
his
inspection
line,
he
might
well
not
be--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
would,
in
my
view,
be
broad
enough
to
cover
the
example
you
are
giving,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
a
reasonable
construction
and
there
would
be
other
ways
of
dealing
with
an
agent's
misconduct
in
those
circumstances.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
congress,
your
honor,
specified
the
situations
in
which
it
was
willing
to
assume
the
common
law
liability
of
the
customs
collector.
it
specified
those
limitations
in
28
u.s.c.
2006,
which
was
enacted
over
100
years
ago
in
1863.
and,
one
of
the
conditions
for
shifting
the
common-law
liability
of
a
collector
to
the
united
states
is
that
the
collector
had
made
his
seizure
based
on
probable
cause
or
on
the
directions
of
a
superior
officer.
in
the
example
you
are
giving,
his
seizure
or
his
detention
almost
certainly
would
not
satisfy
a
probable
cause
requirement.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
the
most
appropriate
remedy
in
that
case
would
be
to
sue
him
personally.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
as
well
as
subsection
(h)
of
the
tort
claims
act
exemptions
which
also
bars
intentional
torts.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
can
give
you
cites
to
a
senate
report
and
a
house
report,
senate
report
no.
1400--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
so
you
should
write
it
down.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
senate
report
no.
1400,
79th
congress,
2d
session,
at
page
33
of
the
1946
report
and
house
report
no.
1287,
79th
congress,
1st
session,
at
page
6,
a
1945
report.
there
are
other
examples
which
i
could
provide
by
letter.
it
was
a
constant
repetition
throughout
the
committee
reports,
but
those--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
don't
have
the
reports
with
me.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
your
honor.
for
more
than
200
years
there
has
been
recognized
a
common-law
tort
action--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
wasn't
just
to
avoid
litigation.
it
was
to
avoid
creating
additional
or
inconsistent
remedies
where
congress
was
satisfied
that
the
existing
remedies
were
adequate.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
think
there
would
be
no
problem
in
petitioner
suing
the
customs
director
for
the
port
of
philadelphia,
who
was
clearly
the
superior--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--that
is
correct
and
it
makes
a
difference.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
is
not
an
academic
distinction
between
our
position
and
petitioner's.
the
reason
is
that
in
28
u.s.c.
2006
congress
attached
conditions
to
the
circumstances
under
which
is
was
willing
to
accept
the
liability
of
the
customs
collector.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
there
was
probable
cause
or
he
was
acting
on
the
orders
of
a
superior
officer.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
99
percent.
i
assume
it
is
true
in
most
cases.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
most
customs
searches
are
without
warrants.
this
case
is
somewhat
unusual
in
that
there
was
a
search
warrant.
i
assume
that
they
are
usually
with
probable
cause
even
though--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
significant
because
congress
has
provided
one
remedy
and
attached
a
condition
to
it
and
it
is...
under
those
circumstances
we
think
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
wipe
those
conditions
or
those
restrictions
out
of
congress'
earlier
statute
by
providing
plaintiff
with
an
additional
remedy.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
customs
collector
would.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
is
true.
it
would
be
an
ordinary
tort
action
in
state
court
which
we
might,
if
we
were
defending
the
customs
collector,
might
remove
to
federal
court,
but
i
would
assume
the
customs
collector
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
but,
it
is
particularly
inappropriate
for
the
courts
to
imply
out
of
this
tort
claims
act
an
additional
remedy
for
the
plaintiff
here
or
any
similar
plaintiff
when
congress
specifically
said
that
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
enacting
this
exemption
was
that
it
was
satisfied
that
the
existing
remedies
were
adequate.
we
would
be
completely
undoing
congress'
decision
that
it
was
perfectly
happy
to
rest
on
the
existing
remedies
and
not
add
an
additional
remedy
if
the
court
were
to
take
the
position
that
really
there
is
no
difference
between
these
two
remedies
and
so
will
we
let
petitioner
or
any
other
plaintiff
have
access
to
his
choice
of
remedies.
congress
didn't
intent
for
there
to
be
a
choice
of
remedies
in
this
situation,
because,
in
fact,
it
knew
about
and
was
satisfied
with
the
long-standing
common-law
remedy
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
was
willing
to
assume
the
custom
collector's
liability.
there
is
another
statutory
remedy
which
we
also
did
not
mention
in
our
brief
and
which
would
not
have
afford
complete
relief
to
petitioner,
but
is,
in
fact,
useful
in
the
type
of
situation
we
are
talking
about.
before
congress
enacted
the
tort
claims
act
in
1946,
it
had
passed
a
small
claims
act
in
1922.
that
statute
was
for
the
most
part
repealed
when
the
tort
claims
act
was
passed,
but
there
was
one
important
exception
to
the
repeal.
congress
provided
that
the
small
claims
act
could
still
be
used
by
agency
heads
as
a
grant
of
discretionary
authority
to
settle
any
tort
claims
that
were
for
less
than
$1,000
and
that
could
not
be
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act
because
of
one
of
the
exemptions.
that
statute
is
now
codified
at
31
u.s.c.
3723
and
what
it
allows
the
customs
service
or
any
other
federal
agency
to
do
is
grant
them
discretionary
authority
to
settle
claims
for
under
$1,000--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--yes,
it
was,
if
he
was
willing
to
waive
$11,000
of
his
claim,
because
there
is
no
judicial
review
under
that
statute
and
acceptance
of
the
settlement
under
that
statute
constitutes
final
settlement
of
the
claim.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
so,
we
recognize
that
it
wouldn't
have
provided
the
complete
relief
he
wanted,
but
what
is
worth
noting
about
the
statute
is
that
the
customs
service
frequently
does
use
it
to
compensate
similar
types
of
accidents.
for
example,
if
a
traveler
is
passing
through
customs
inspection
at
an
airport
and
a
customs
inspector
accidentally
drops
the
traveler's
camera,
if
the
value
of
the
camera
is
less
than
$1,000,
the
agency
can
and
does
use
the
authority
of
the
small
claims
act
to
reimburse
that
traveler
for
the
injury
or
damage
to
his
camera.
we
thinks
that
represents
a
reasonable
compromise
that
congress
was
willing
to
undertake.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
right.
and,
that
is
the
most--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
although
i
called
petitioner's
counsel
on
friday
and
told
him
about
the
statute.
we
think
this
is
a
reasonable
compromise
legislative
judgment
that
congress
made,
whereby
it
is
willing
to
assume
or
have
agency
heads
assume
liability
for
small
claims
under
$1,000,
but
it
is
not
willing
to
assume
liability
for
the
potentially
much
larger
claims
like
petitioner's
or
others,
and
the
reason
congress
would
not
have
wanted
to
do
that
is
the
vast
scope
of
customs
service
operations.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
customs
last
year,
in
1982,
made
59,000
separate
seizures,
not
including
seizures
related
to
the
drug
laws.
this
is
really
one'
of
the
most
enormous
programs
the
government
runs
and
congress
could
reasonably
decide
that
it
was
unwilling
to
assume
responsibility
for
such
a
large
program.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
is
the
government's
position
that
it
applies
to
any
seizure
by
any
law
enforcement
officer.
it
clearly
covers
internal
revenue
officers
as
well
as
customs
officers
by
its
expressed
terms.
and,
then
the
phrase,
"any
other
law
enforcement
officer",
we
think
means
what
it
says,
any
other
law
enforcement
officer--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--well,
there
might
be
a
bivens
action
or
something
against
the
agent,
but
i
don't
think--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--the
ninth
circuit,
which
is
the
only
court
to
address
this,
originally
in
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
tang...
judge
tang
expressed
the
view
that
it
did
not
include
any
other
law
enforcement
officer,
that
it
was
limited
to
customs
or
revenue
officers
or
other
officers
acting
in
that
capacity.
but,
in
the
subsequent
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit,
noting
judge
tang's
opinion,
said
it
disagreed
with
that
and
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
did,
in
fact,
cover
any
other
law
enforcement
agency.
so,
the
statute
frequently
has
been
used
to
cover
agencies
like
the
food
and
drug
administration
when
they
seize
potentially
adulterated
food.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes.
let's
say
that
the
food
is
stored
in
a
negligent
manner
so
that
it
becomes
worthless
even
though
it
is
ultimately
returned
to
the
claimant.
it
has
been
held
that
this
section
bars
actions
for
the
value
of
the
lost
food.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
is
correct.
the
vast
scope
of
customs
operations
that
i
was
referring
to
a
moment
ago
is
another
important
policy
reason
that
supports
our
reading
of
the
statute.
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
tort
claims
act,
congress
expressed
considerable
concern
that
certain
types
of
claims
offered
great
potential
for
abuse
and
for
fraudulent
or
excessive
claims.
given
the
number
of
customs
seizures
each
year,
that
certainly
is
a
realistic
possibility
in
this
situation.
the
problems
of
proof
for
the
government
would
be
enormous
because
it
is
simply
not
realistic
to
expect
a
customs
inspector
to
be
able
to
remember
the
details
of
every
inspection
and
yet
when
the
owner
of
property
comes
into
court
in
a
tort
claims
action
and
claims
that
his
property
was
in
perfect
condition
and
the
customs
service
really
can't
remember
what
happened
with
that
seizure,
it
has
no
effective
way
of
rebutting
the
claim.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
except
that
the
government
has
protected
itself
to
some
extent
by
imposing
limitations
on
when
it
is
willing
to
shoulder
the
customs
collectors'
common-law
liability.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
that
is
correct.
ms.

that
is
correct.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
by
the
tort
claims
act,
that
is
right,
it
would
not
have
been.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
if
he
could
have
proved
negligence,
he
might
have
won
and
almost
certainly
the
united
states
would
have
paid
the
judgment
in
this
case.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no,
it
is
not
open
to
him
because
the
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
has
expired.
it
is
a
two-year
statute.
we
think
what
would
be
the
applicable
statute--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--i
would
see
no
basis
on
which
it
could
be
considered
tolled.
it
is
an
action
under
pennsylvania
law.
it
is
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
pennsylvania
seems
the
logical
place
to
me
because
the
seizure
occurred
there,
petitioner
lives
there,
the
customs
agents
responsible
are
there
from
the
philadelphia
customs
office.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
no.
justice
stevens,
it
may
appear
to
be
an
academic
distinction
but
that
is
simply
no
justification
for
the
court
to
rewrite
the
tort
claims
act.
even
if
in--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
came
to
my
attention
through
a
student
note
on
this
case
and
which
the
student
said
he
submitted
to
the
court.
but,
i
can
also
provide
additional
citations
for
the
court
after
the--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--students
tend
to
sympathize
with
mr.
kosak.
the
students
seem
to
think
that
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
sit
as
a
committee
of
congress
and
rewrite
the
statute.
i
really
have
very
little
further
except
to
note
that
it
is
our
position
that
congress
has
made
a
reasonable
legislative
judgment
about
the
limits
of
liability
that
it
was
willing
to
undertake.
that
judgment
has
to
be
respected
by
this
court.
and
for
the
remainder
of
petitioner's
arguments
about
the
stereo
receiver
and
the
court
pagoda
we
are
willing
to
rely
on
our
brief.
thank
you.
