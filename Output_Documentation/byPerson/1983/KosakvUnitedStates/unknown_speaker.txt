unknown
speaker
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
democracy?
i
thought
democracy
was
the
idea
that
the
majority
rules
and
that
if
the
majority
decides
that
a
person
can't
sue
the
government,
that
certainly
is
perfectly
democratic,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
the
the
principle...
up
to
the
time
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
they
could
not
sue.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
naftulin,
isn't
your
difficulty
here
with
the
language
of
the
tort
claims
act
as
far
as
any
claim...
this
is
the
language
of
it...
arising
in
respect
of
detention
of
any
goods
or
merchandise
by
any
officer
of
customs.
isn't
that
your
problem?
unknown
speaker
on
the
face
of
it
that
seems...
what
happened
here
was
there
was
a
detention
of
your
client's
goods
or
merchandise
by
an
officer
of
customs,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
then
why
doesn't
that
preclude
recovery
under
that
act?
unknown
speaker
but,
there
the
court
held
that
what
the
plaintiff
was
suing
on
was
not
a
misrepresentation,
so
it
simply
wasn't
covered
by
that
exception.
unknown
speaker
why
should
they
be
very
narrowly
construed?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
really
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
i
mean
the
exemption
speaks
for
itself
in
its
language
and
congress
has
described
in
language
what
it
thought
might
cause
harm
to
the
government
in
terms
of
allowing
exemption.
and,
if
the
thing
is
within
the
language
of
the
exemption,
the
fact
that
arguable
there
is
no
harm
to
the
government
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
would
take
it
out
of
the
exemption,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
naftulin,
generally
speaking,
if
you
view
the
federal
tort
claims
act
as
a
whole,
hasn't
this
court
interpreted
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
narrowly
so
that
it
is
a
little
inconsistent
to
argue
that
you
should
view
the
exemption
narrowly.
if
you
fit
the
exemption
into
the
act
as
a
whole,
hasn't
the
court
generally
given
the
waiver
a
narrow
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
is
time
for
us
to
narrow
it
then.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
is
time
for
us
to
narrow
it
so
people
like
you
won't
misunderstand
it.
unknown
speaker
i
never
understood
that
when
you
waive
sovereign
immunity
you
do
it
on
the
broadest
terms.
i
have
never
heard
that.
they
don't
go
together.
sovereign
immunity
and
waiver
and
moral
rights
and
equity,
they
don't
all
together.
they
are
different
ball
parks,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
sovereign
immunity
just
says
that
you
can't
sue
on
anything.
is
there
anything
broader
than
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
when
you
waive
that...
they
could
have
passed
a
law
and
said
you
can
sue
on
anything,
but
congress
didn't.
do
you
know
why?
they
didn't
intend
to
waive
everything.
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
to
rewrite
the
statute.
you
can
rewrite
it,
but
we
can't.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
you
think
we
can
rewrite
statutes?
unknown
speaker
you
want
us
to
do
something
about
two
words,
in
respect...
three
words.
you
want
us
to
rewrite
those
three
words?
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
get
all
these
cases
on
sovereign
immunity
if
they
waived
it?
how
did
we
get
this
case
if
they
waived
it?
unknown
speaker
do
i
correctly
understand,
mr.
naftulin,
in
essence
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
the
exception
against
any
liability
applies
only
to
the
fact
of
the
tension
of
the
group
and--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
harm
is
done
while
they
are
detained
the
exception
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
and,
you
arrive
at
that
primarily
by
emphasis
on
in
respect
of
as
distinguished
from
arising
from?
unknown
speaker
on
that
point,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
toward
the
end
of
the
government's
brief,
they
discussion
a
common
law
remedy
against
the
customs
officer
for
negligence
and
then
a
provision,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
government
would,
in
effect,
pay
the
judgment
if
there
was
a
recovery
against
the
officer.
would
you
comment
on
that
argument?
you
said
when
you
started
out
that
you
thought
your
only
remedy
was
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
but
what
about
the
existence
of
this
common
law
remedy?
unknown
speaker
but,
you
could
have
sue
one
of
them
for
that
one
item
then?
unknown
speaker
and,
you
couldn't
possibly
in
discovery
in
that
case
have
asked
questions
about
the
handling
of
the
other
items?
unknown
speaker
mr.
naftulin,
the
government
also
noted,
i
think,
in
its
brief
that
judge
holtzoff,
who
was
apparently
the
drafter
of
this
section,
had
analogized
the
draft
to
a
provision
in
the
british
tort
claims
act
and
patterned
it
after
that
under
which
very
clearly
damage
caused
by
negligence
of
the
customs
officers
would
not
be
covered.
is
that
relevant
to
our
inquiry
then
by
way
of
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
why
was
the
seizure
made
in
this
case
initially?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
you
might
say
that
in
some
cases
an
initial
seizure
would
be
negligently
made
in
the
sense
that
there
really
wasn't
any
basis
for
it.
what
if
that
were
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
agents
had
acted
carefully,
they
wouldn't
have
seized
the
goods.
they
acted
carelessly
in
seizing
the
goods.
would
you
say
that
the...
assume
that
that
were
the
case,
that
they
acted...
it
was
negligent.
would
you
think
that
the
government
would
be
liable
for
deterioration?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
any
event,
in
some
instances
at
least
you
would
concede
that
the
government
would
be
immune
from
claims
for
negligence?
unknown
speaker
you
are
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
the
case
justice
white
poses,
as
i
understand
it,
the
test
is
probably
cause,
isn't
it?
and,
if
there
was
no
probable
cause,
the
agent
is
absolutely
liable,
isn't
he,
as
a
matter
of
common
law?
isn't
that
what
the
common-law
remedy
was?
unknown
speaker
can
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
ms.
oberly?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
possible
to
read
that
language
though,
ms.
oberly,
as
dealing
in
kind
of
a
common-law
notion
of
detinue,
intentional
detention
by
the
customs
agent
and
not
reaching
just
negligent
mishap
while
it
is
in
the
process
of
being
detained?
unknown
speaker
the
language
would
certainly
allow
that
distinction,
don't
you
think?
i
mean
it
isn't
really
terribly
precise
language.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
are
reading
it
as
if
instead
of
it
saying
in
respect
to
it
said
in
the
course
of,
and,
those
are
two
different
phrases
i
think.
unknown
speaker
it
is
true
though
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
language.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
in
effect
that
congress,
in
saying
"in
respect
of",
in
fact,
is
simply
using
another
way
of
saying
from.
unknown
speaker
arising
out
of
or
from.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
subdivision
or
section
where
"in
respect
of"
appears?
unknown
speaker
and,
some
people
used
"from"
rather
than
either
"arising
out
of"
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you
have
to
go
to
the
legislative
history,
it
is
hardly
a
plain-language
case,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
an
intentional
damage
to
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
or
he
might
be
subject...
the
agent
might
be
subject
to
suit.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
i
want
to
know
what
would
you
say
about
it
in
light
of
the
"respect
of"
language?
let's
assume
that
his
only
defense
was
that
he
has
been
exempted
from
liability
by
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so.
that
may
be
so,
but
would
it
be
in
respect
of
the
detention?
i
want
to
know
how
you
would
react
to
an
intentional
tort
if
the
only
defense
was,
well,
the
statute...
i
just
listened
to
the
solicitor
general's
representative
say
that
this
language
is
plain
and
it
exempts
all
kinds
of...
it
excludes
any
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--you
wouldn't
have
to
get
into
all
those
other
difficult
questions
if
this
is
a
plain
meaning
of
this
statute
at
issue
here
is
that
it
would
also
foreclose
any
actions
for
intentional
torts.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
just
assume
that
if
it
was
a
proper
seizure
the
only
thing
is
the
custom
officers...
one
of
them
deliberately
damaged
the
goods.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
would
purport
to...
i
take
it
you
think
the
statute
we
are
talking
about
here
would
bar
an
action
for
intentional
torts
as
well
as
negligent.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
on
the
legislative
history.
you
say
that,
as
i
understood
you,
that
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history
congress
referred
to
arising
out
of
rather
than
in
respect
of.
what
is
the
clearest
example
in
the
legislative
history
that
supports
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
is
it
quoted
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
a
new
argument.
unknown
speaker
i
was
wondering
because
i
hadn't
seen
the
argument
before.
unknown
speaker
can
you
quote
one?
unknown
speaker
this
is
really
your
principal
argument
though,
because
the
language
is
different.
if
one
just
looks
at
the
"respect
of"
language
and
the
"arising
out
of"
language
one
would
note
immediately
there
is
a
difference
and
the
"arising
out
of"
is
broader.
would
you
also
explain
something
else
to
me?
do
you
agree
that
there
is
a
common-law
remedy
against
the
individual
officer
which
the
government
would
actually
have
to
pay
the
liability?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
force
to
your
argument
in
the
brief
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
exemption
was
to
avoid
all
this
kind
of
litigation?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
existing
remedy
is
adequate
if
there
is
some
difficulty
in
identifying
which
officer
caused
the
damage?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
your
case
really
boils
down
to
is
that
they
filed
the
wrong
kind
of
complaint.
they
should
have
sued
the
customers
officer
in
common
law
and
asked
for
relief
against
the
united
states
if
they
get
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
all
the
fight
about?
unknown
speaker
namely
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
seizure.
unknown
speaker
which
is
true
in
99
percent
of
the
cases,
isn't
it?
so,
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
preserve
the
government's
immunity
in
that
one
percent.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
they
don't
seize
property
without
probable
cause
very
often.
unknown
speaker
but,
am
i
correct
in
believing
that
the
practical
significance
of
the
government's
position
relates
only
to
those
cases
where
the
seizure
itself
was
unjustified?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
2006
do
you
get
a
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
an
additional
difference
between
the
tort
claims
act
and--
unknown
speaker
--was
that
remedy
available
to
this
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
the
limit
here
is
$1,000,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
again,
this
is
31
u.s.c.
3723?
unknown
speaker
is
that
statute
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
this
is
another
new
argument?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
2680(c)?
is
the
exemption
there
limited
to
customs
officers
or
does
it
apply
to
any
seizure
by
any
law
enforcement
officer?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
that
if
there
is
an...
an
fbi
agent
executes
a
warrant
and
gets
custody
of
some
physical
objects
and
they
are
negligently
damaged
while
in
his
custody,
is
there
any
remedy
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
that
is
unlike
the
other,
there
is
no
common-law
remedy
of
any
kind
there?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
am
assuming
that
there
was
probable
cause,
but
he
just
dropped
the
clock
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
it
would
clearly
protect
them
for
the
delay
and
the
alleged
conversion,
but
it
also
has
been
held
that
it
protects
them
from
damage
to
the
proper--
unknown
speaker
--and,
drawing
the
distinction
between
conversion
and
property
damage.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
will
be
liable
under
the
common-law
theory
in
all
of
those
situations,
won't
they?
i
mean,
they
have
the
same
problem
if
it
is
common-law
theory
or
a
tort
claim.
unknown
speaker
but,
in
all
the
cases
in
which
the
seizure
was
lawful,
the
problem
is
identical?
unknown
speaker
which
is
most
cases.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
indicates
that
if
this
suit
had
been
brought
against
the
individual
customs
officer
in
this
case,
it
would
not
have
been
affected
by
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
and,
he
might
have
won
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
action
still
open?
unknown
speaker
it
hasn't
been
tolled
by
this
suit.
unknown
speaker
the
filing
of
one
suit
doesn't
toll
another
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
but,
the
suit,
you
say,
would
be
under
pennsylvania
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
wouldn't
be
state
law
barred
for
federal
law
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
no
justification
for
rewriting
assuming
this
is
what
congress
intended,
of
course,
but
congress
did
use
different
words
in
this
section
than
used
in
any
other
section.
and,
of
course,
we
weren't
aware
of
this
legislative
history
that
you
mentioned
until
today.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
student's
bottom
line
in
that
note?
[laughter]
he
thought
the
government
was
wrong,
i
believe.
