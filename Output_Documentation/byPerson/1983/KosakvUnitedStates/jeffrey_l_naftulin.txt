mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
we
got
back
mr.
kosak's
oriental
and
art
collection
in
its
damaged
condition,
we
had
a
decision
we
had
to
make.
could
we
force
the
government
or
get
some
kind
of
trial
to
make
the
government
pay
for
the
damage
that
they
did
to
mr.
kosak's
collection.
we
came
up
with
one
viable
alternative
in
which
we
could
file
a
suit
and
that
was
the
claim
under
the
federal
torts
claims
act.
this
case
comes
down
to
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
eventually
we
reached
the
point
of
just
determining
the
exact
language
of
an
exemption
in
the
statute,
but
before
i
get
to
that
exact
language,
which
should
be
the
starting
point,
there
are
a
couple
of
principles
which
i
think
this
court
should
keep
in
mind
and
that
is
the
federal
torts
claims
act
itself
which
gave
the
citizens
the
right
to
sue
the
government
for
negligence
in
the
same
way
as
if
they
were
suing
a
private
individual.
there
is
one
main
reason...
there
is
one
main
area
in
which
we
disagreed
with
the
third
circuit
and
that
is
whether
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
was
a
broad
concept
or
not.
we
took
the
position
that
sovereign
immunity...
that
the
federal
torts
claims
act
waived
sovereign
immunity
broadly.
the
third
circuit
said,
no,
that
this
was
just
a
narrow
restriction
and
our
position
was
that
they
were
misreading
the
teachings
of
this
court,
although
they
accused
us
of
doing
the
same.
when
congress
passed
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
they
did
it
for
several
reasons,
one
being
that
the
prevalent
feeling
at
that
time
was
that
it
should
be
fundamental
to
a
democracy
that
an
individual
who
is
injured
should
not
be
deprived
of
redress
merely
because
that
injury
was
caused
by
the
government.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
well,
there
are
certain
principles
that
come
into
a
democracy
of
providing
for
the
common
good.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
correct,
but
you
could
bring
a
private
bill
before
the
congress,
which
was
the
second
reason
why
the
act
came
into
being,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--exactly,
justice
brennan.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
okay,
for
the
following
reasons:
first
of
all,
the
exemption
should
be
narrowly
construed.
now,
what
we
did
was
we
approached
it
several
different
ways.
the
first
way
we
used
the
exact
words.
we
went
to
the
exact
wording,
"any
claim
arising
in
respect
of
the
detention.
"
now,
we
went
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
words
"in
respect
of".
we
looked
at
several
dictionary
definitions,
but
what
we
say
cited
to
the
court
were
the
words
that
judge
weis
used
in
his
dissent.
they
mean
as
to,
as
regards,
insofar
as
concerns,
with
respect
to.
i
think
if
you
just
look
at
the
words
themselves,
they
are
going
to
the
fact
of
the
detention
itself
and
not
something
that
arises
during
the
detention.
our
first
argument
is
the
words
itself.
the
second
one,
okay,
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
exemptions
under
2680
and
see
the
language
that
was
used
there.
the
customs
exemption,
2680(c),
is
the
only
one
that
speaks
in
terms
of
in
respect
of,
arising
in
respect
of.
the
others
are
all
any
claim
arising
out
of
that
they
are
speaking
of
in
terms
of
the
postal
service.
any
claim
for
damages,
period,
when
they
are
talking
about
the
operations
of
the
treasury.
any
claim
arising
out
of
when
they
are
talking
the
military
or
combatant
activities,
any
claim
arising
in
a
foreign
country,
any
claim
arising
from
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
any
claim
from
with
the
panama
canal
company,
any
claim
arising
from
the
activities
of
it.
there
is
a
distinction.
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
exception
for
the
customs
service
was
the
only
one
that
used
the
words
"in
respect
of".
now,
congress
spent
30
years
writing
this
act
and
what
i
submit
to
this
court
is
that
there
is
a
reason
for
this
distinction.
as
subtle
as
it
might
be,
there
is
a
reason
for
this
distinction.
so,
aside
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
itself,
you
then
have,
looking
at
the
entire
act
itself...
in
fact,
in
the
second
circuit
decision,
in
the
alliance
case...
the
alliance
case
analyzed
the
exception
for
the
postal
service
which
was
any
claiming
arising
out
of
the
loss,
miscarriage,
or
negligent
transmission
of
letters
or
postal
matter.
it
actually
used
the
word
"negligent",
negligent
transmission
of
letters.
and,
the
alliance
court's
argument
was,
well,
if
the
customs
service
was
going
to
be
excused
for
their
negligence,
that
that
wording
would
have
gone
into
the
statute
as
well.
there
is
a
couple
of
other
things,
too,
that
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court.
for
instance,
this
court
made
a
decision
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
munez
in
which
the
court
ruled
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act
did
not
bar
a
case
against
the
united
states
for
the
negligence
of
a
federal
employee,
namely,
a
prisoner
worker,
someone
working
in
a
prison.
now,
one
of
these
exceptions
here
says
it
bars
under
2680(h)
any
claim
arising
out
of
a
false
imprisonment.
now,
go
back
to
the
munez
facts
in
which
mr.
munez
was
in
prison
and
he
was
eventually
beaten
up
in
prison,
he
claimed,
because
of
negligence
of
the
guards.
suppose
mr.
munez
is
put
in
the
prison...
that
he
is
falsely
in
prison,
that
the
government
imprisoned
the
wrong
mr.
munez,
all
right?
should
that
exemption,
any
claim
arising
out
of
false
imprisonment
now
bar
suit
under
these
circumstances?
i
think
there
is
certain
distinctions
that
are
made
in
these
exemptions
and
that
these
exemptions
must
be
narrowly
construed.
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
block
versus
neill,
which
was
a
decision
by
justice
marshall,
the
government
tried
to
assert
the
exemption,
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
misrepresentation.
and,
this
court
again
saw
these
distinctions
and
allowed
the
suit
to
be
brought
on
another
theory,
on
the
good
samaritan
theory,
because
the
government
had
agreed
to
undertake
certain
action
in
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
right,
but
it
is
still
arguable
that
it
is
any
claim
arising
out
of
the
misrepresentation.
and,
what
i
am
saying...
my
point
is
that
these
exemptions
should
not
be
broadly
construed,
but
they
should
be
very
narrowly
construed.
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--because
of
the
reasons
for
the
exemptions
themselves.
the
exemptions
are
meant
to
prevent
a
harm
to
the
government.
if
there
is
no
harm
to
the
government,
then
the
exemption
shouldn't
bar
the
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
well,
i
am
not
trying
to
tell
you
to
take
it
out
of
the
exemption.
it
is
a
question
of
how
you
interpret
the
exemption.
if
there
is
an
exemption
for
this,
then
you
just
can't
bring
the
suit
and
that
is
actually
what
you
have
to
determine.
but,
if
you
went
back
to
that
block
versus
neill
case,
you
could
interpret
it
broadly
of
any
act
arising
out
of
a
misrepresentation
or
you
can
look
at
it
much
finer
by
saying,
well,
there
is
a
second
theory
here
on
which
to
go
to.
therefore,
that
general
language
doesn't
block
the
suit.
there
had
to
be
a
reason
why
congress
used
the
words
"in
respect
to"
here.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
no,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
given
the
waiver
a
narrow
interpretation.
if
you
go
into
cases
like
indian
telling
versus
the
united
states
and
rainier,
inc.
versus
the
united
states,
and
even
if
you
took
the
dalehite
case
which
is
the
leading
case
on
sovereign
immunity,
it
spoke
in
terms
of
the
general
grant
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
indian
telling
case
spoke
in
terms
of...
used
the
word
"broad"
in
talking
about
sovereign
immunity.
the
rainier
case
spoke
in
terms
of
the
new
and
novel
theories
of
tort
were
going
to
come
into
being.
there
is
probably
only--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
that,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--i
don't
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
i
don't
agree
with
you,
justice
marshall.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
i
agree
with
you
on
that
principle.
i
am
not
asking
you
to
rewrite
the
statute.
i
am
not
asking
you
to
do
that.
but,
when
congress
says...
when
congress
passes
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--no,
i
don't
want
you
to
rewrite
them.
i
just
want
you
to
apply
them
and
interpret
them
the
same
way
that
congress
meant
to
do
it.
that
is
all
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do.
when
congress
passed
the
federal
torts
claims
act,
it
waived
sovereign
immunity
except
in
certain
specific
situations,
the
exemptions
under
2680.
there
were
also
certain
other
safeguards,
which
i
will
call
administrative
safeguards,
which
were
also
put
in
such
as
the
statute
of
limitations
or
you
get
a
non-jury
trial
or
you
can't
get
interest
or
penalties,
but
when
they
passed
this
act,
they
said
that
you
can
sue
the
government
in
the
same
situation
as
if
you
were
suing
an
individual
if
the
individual
was
negligent.
they
did
away
with
sovereign
immunity
when
they
did
that.
and,
then
they
came
up
with
these
specifics--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--because
sometimes
these
acts
have
to
be
interpreted
by
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
that
is
one
of
the
ways
i
do
it.
that
is
one
of
my
arguments.
another
one
of
my
arguments
is
the
plain
dictionary
definition
of
the
words.
i
think
that
probably
even
more
importantly
than
that
we
come
to
what
i
call
the
area
of
the
legislative
intent.
the
exemptions
were
brought
in
because,
as
a
policy
matter,
the
government
should
be
free
from
certain
claims
or
that
there
is
certain
other
machinery
that
is
available
in
order
to
bring
the
claim.
when
judge
alexander
holtzoff
was
testifying
before
the
senate
judiciary
subcomittee,
he
made
certain
remarks
which
this
court
even
cited
that
footnote
in
the
hatzlachh
decision
where
he
brought
in
these
two
principles
that
as
a
policy
matter
the
government
should
be
free
from
claims
or
that
there
was
other
machinery
and
he
gave
certain
examples.
he
spoke
about
the
postal
service
and
he
spoke
about
intentional
torts
and
at
that
time
he
said
as
a
policy
matter
the
government
should
be
free
of
all...
free
from
suit,
not
situation.
then
he
spoke
about
the
customs
service
and
when
he
spoke
about
the
customs
service
he
said,
because
this
is
an
area
in
which
other
remedies
are
available.
now,
the
only
other
remedies
that
were
available
at
this
time
were
remedies
to
challenge
unlawful
detentions
or
to
challenge
the
amount
of
the
duty.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
i
agree
that
there
is
that
common-law
remedy.
the
problem
that
we
had
in
our
case
was
that
when
the
customs
agents
were
executing
the
search
warrant,
one
particular
agent
dropped
a
cork
carving
of
a
pagoda
in
front
of
him.
that
was
the
only
act
of
negligence
that
we
actually
saw.
other
than
that,
okay...
other
than
that,
your
honor,
we
couldn't
prove
any
specific
act
of
negligence
against
any
specific
customs
agent
and
that
is
why
we
didn't
sue
that.
if
we
could
have
done
that,
then
we
would
have
sued
the
individual
customs
agents
themselves.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
well,
we
thought
about
that,
but
i
am
sure...
we
felt
certain
at
that
time
that
the
answers
that
we
would
have
gotten
were
that
we
know
nothing
about
this.
we
know
nothing
about
how
this
happened
or
why
this
happened.
we
considered
that
theory.
we
considered
filing
an
action
under
the
tucker
act
for
a
breach
an
implied
contract
of
filament.
we
considered
an
action
under
the
federal
torts
claims
act.
and,
this
one
really
seemed
to
us
to
be
the
only
viable
alternative.
we
figured
that...
well,
we
really
balanced
whether
the
government...
the
reason
is
here
really
for
the
exemption.
we
recognized
the
need
for
the
customs
service
to
be
able
to
seize
property.
we
really
didn't
dispute
that.
but,
the
reason
why
that
is
a
necessity
is
so
that
it
won't
hinder
them
in
what
they
are
doing.
they
should
have
free
reign
in
being
able
to
seize
and
detain.
they
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
whether
they
are
going
to
be
sued
for
doing
it.
but,
after
they
do
that,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
have
to
handle
the
property
with
care.
customs
seizes
items
which
are
very
valuable,
which
are
worth
a
lot
of
money.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
an
oriental
clock,
the
equivalent
of
a
grandfather
clock,
which
they
just
decided
it
was
too
impossible
for
them
to
move
that
clock,
that
it
definitely
would
have
been
damaged
if
they
did
that.
you
really
have
to
balance
what
we
are
trying
to
protect
here
in
determining
whether
the
exemption
applies
or
not.
and,
our
point
is
that
the
basis
of
the
exemptions
were
in
order
to
protect
a
harm
against
the
government
and
when
you
are...
well,
our
point
is
that
it
wasn't
the
intention
of
congress
to
give
the
customs
service
a
license
to
be
negligent.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
i
think
it
is
to
some
extent.
and,
i
also
felt
that
that
section
helped
us
to
a
great
degree,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
british
act,
the
crown
proceeding
that
the
government
was
referring
to
there
was
speaking
primarily
of
damages
for
deterioration
to
the
property
or
damages
for
delay.
i
will
concede
that
the
general
language
of
the
crown
proceeding
said
more
than
that,
but
the
words
about
the
detention
or
the
detention
were
not
in
the
part
of
the
original
statute.
they
were
added
on
and
i
think
that
it
supports
our
position
that
they
were
added
on
to
clearly
specify
that,
well,
you
can't
sue
them
for
the
delay
or
for
the
deterioration
of
the
goods.
it
went
to
the
fact
of
the
detention,
not
so
much
during
the
detention.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
the
customs
agents
accused
mr.
and
mrs.
kosak
of
smuggling
their
collection
into
the
country.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
it
doesn't
go
to
the
legality
of
the
seizure,
okay?
you
have
thrown
the
word
"negligently"
in
there.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
no,
i
wouldn't
in
that
situation.
the
act
didn't
mean
to
go
to
that,
justice
white.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
well,
i
don't...
you
have
thrown
the
word
"negligence"
in
there.
i
don't
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
naftulin
--i
don't
think
that
that
is
really
a
case
of
negligence.
you
might
be
able
to
use
negligence,
okay,
for
a
reason
of
illegality
of
a
seizure,
but
the
key
words
in
that
situation
aren't
the
negligence.
the
keys
words
are
the
legality
of
the
seizure.
and,
it
is
for
these
reasons
