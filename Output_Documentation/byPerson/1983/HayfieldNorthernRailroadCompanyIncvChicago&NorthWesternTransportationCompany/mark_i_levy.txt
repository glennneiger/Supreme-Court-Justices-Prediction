mr.
mark
i.
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
briefly
summarize
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
and
then
turn
to
the
issue
of
opportunity
costs
that
the
appellee
has
raised
in
this
brief.
our
submission
is
that
section
10905
does
not
preempt
a
state's
condemnation
of
a
rail
line
that
has
been
abandoned
with
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
icc
authority
over
abandonments
extends
up
to
but
not
beyond
the
point
that
the
abandonment
becomes
effective
and
the
line
is
no
longer
a
common
carrier
in
the
interstate
rail
system.
section
10905
is
part
of
the
federal
regulation
of
carriers
in
interstate
commerce.
it
pertains
to
pre-abandonment
offers
of
financial
assistance
and
provides
an
alternative
to
abandonment
in
order
to
furnish
continued
and
uninterrupted
service
on
the
line.
moreover,
the
time
limits
in
section
10905
were
intended
to
expedite
the
abandonment
process
of
the
icc
in
order
to
alleviate
the
burden
on
the
carrier
of
providing
service
until
the
effective
date
of
the
abandonment,
which
is
postponed
during
the
pendency
of
the
section
10905
offer.
once
icc
abandonment
approval
takes
effect,
the
carrier
is
free
of
its
federal
obligation
to
maintain
service
and
it
can
then
abandon
the
line.
at
that
point
the
railroad
has
obtained
what
the
icc
authorized,
its
federal
service
obligation
is
eliminated
and
it
is
relieved
of
its
federal
common
carrier
duties.
a
subsequent
state
condemnation
proceeding
to
initiate
new
service
pursuant
to
a
fresh
icc
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
not
interfere
with
the
authorized
abandonment
or
be
contrary
to
the
federal
policy
of
expediting
abandonments
in
order
to
reduce
the
burden
that
federal
service
requirements
impose
on
carriers
seeking
to
abandon
a
line.
and
section
10905
affords
no
basis
whatever
to
distinguish
between
former
rail
property
and
all
other
private
property
in
the
state
that
is
subject
to
the
traditional
power
of
condemnation.
now,
the
railroad
makes
an
argument
in
its
brief
based
on
so-called
opportunity
costs.
in
an
abandonment
proceeding,
one
of
the
factors
considered
by
the
icc
is
that
federal
service
requirements
keep
a
railroad
from
using
its
resources
in
other
more
profitable
ways.
this
relative
economic
disadvantage
or
loss
is
the
opportunity
cost
that
the
railroad
incurs
in
connection
with
the
line
it
seeks
to
abandon.
appellee
contends
that
a
state's
post-abandonment
condemnation,
and
especially
preliminary
injunctive
relief
incident
to
that
condemnation,
restricts
the
railroad's
cause
if
its
track
and
equipment
and
thus
imposes
on
the
railroad
the
same
opportunity
cost
that
the
icc
considered
granting
the
abandonment
in
the
first
place.
however,
the
icc's
abandonment
approval
only
determined
that,
in
balancing
the
competing
considerations
for
and
against
abandonment
under
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
the
need
for
this
service
did
not
justify
the
costs,
including
the
opportunity
costs
that
such
service
would
impose
on
the
carrier.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
believe
that
the
commission's
determination
is
essentially
retrospective
or
contemporaneous.
it
determines
that
the
current
requirements
are
presently
keeping
the
railroad
from
using
its
assets
in
more
productive
ways.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
if
there
were
a
federal
service
requirement
that
required
the
service,
the
railroad
to
maintain
the
service
and
therefore
prohibited
other
use--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--it
would
exist
up
to
the
time
that
the
icc's
abandonment
certificate
takes
effect.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
and
that's
over,
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
correct.
the
opportunity
cost
is
only
a
consideration
in
conjunction
with
state
law...
excuse
me,
federal
law.
the
icc
determined,
and
all
that
it
determined,
and
all
that
it
determined,
is
that
federal
law
does
not
require
the
imposition
of
these
costs
on
the
carrier.
this
determination
that
local
service
needs
do
not
outweigh
the
burdens
on
the
carrier
and
thus
that
abandonment
may
occur
simply
does
not
address
the
question
whether
the
carrier
can
be
required
to
leave
its
track
and
equipment
in
place
for
independent
reasons
of
state
law.
the
icc
has
authority
over
entry
into,
exit
from
and
operations
in
the
interstate
rail
system.
it
does
not
have
authority,
let
alone
exclusive
authority,
over
post-abandonment
transfer
of
property
that
were
at
one
time
used
in
rail
service.
the
icc's
abandonment
approval
does
not
establish
an
affirmative
federal
right
in
a
railroad
to
avoid
state
law
that
would
restrict
its
cause
of
its
assets,
of
what
formerly
were
rail
property,
and
such
state
law
does
not
interfere
with
the
abandonment
authorized
by
the
commission.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
well,
intrastate
lines
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
icc.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
no,
it
couldn't.
that
is
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
icc.
now,
it
may
be
said.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
there's
no
question
it
would
have
the
authority
if
it
found
such
a
condition
to
be
necessary
or
appropriate
to
the
interests
of
the
interstate
rail
system.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
not
aware
of
any
incident
where
it
can
be
definitively
said
that
the
commission
did
it.
it
may
have
done
it
in
the
boston
&
maine
case
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
that
involved
an
insolvent
carrier,
and
the
court
of
appeals'
description
of
the
icc
order
suggests
that
the
commission
did
condition
the
abandonment
on
the--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
wasn't
aware
of
that.
this
decision
that
i'm
referring
to--
mr.
mark
i.
levy
--i
think
this
was
a
first
circuit
decision
that
is
long
since
over.
if
the
case
is
still
pending,
i
don't
think
that
bears
on
this
point.
but
the
boston
&
maine
was
the
closest
case,
if
there's
one
at
all.
but
that
would
be
a
much
different
case.
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
the
commission's
authority
prior
to
abandonment,
and
the
statute
expressly
authorities
in
section
10905(b)(1)
the
commission
to
impose
conditions
on
abandonment.
and
in
such
a
case
there
would
be
an
actual
conflict
between
the
state's
condemnation
proceeding
and
the
order
of
the
commerce
commission
and
the
federal
interest
that
underlies
it.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
mean
that
only
in
the
generic
sense.
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i'm
sorry?
mr.
mark
i.
levy
i
think
that's
right,
although
i
can't
say
authoritatively
that
there
may
not
be
some
incidental
pieces
of
property
used
in
connection
with
the
track
at
issue.
we
would
not
distinguish
between
them.
thank
you.
