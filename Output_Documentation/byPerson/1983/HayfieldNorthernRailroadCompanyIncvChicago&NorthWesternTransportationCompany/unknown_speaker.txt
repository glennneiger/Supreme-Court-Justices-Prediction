unknown
speaker
counsel,
just
what
it
now
at
issue
in
the
case?
the
rails
are
gone,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
do
your
people
propose
to
put
down
new
rails?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
counsel,
that
after
the
commission
has
acted
as
it
has
here,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
case
except
some
real
estate
with
some
iron
rails
resting
on
it?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
carrier
any
more.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
carrier
any
more.
unknown
speaker
will
the
new
company,
will
your
client,
in
starting
rail
service
if
you
win
this
case
have
to
get
another
certificate
from
the
icc?
unknown
speaker
even
though
just
a
short
while
ago
the
commission
authorized
the
abandonment
of
the
line?
unknown
speaker
would
that
mean
that...
would
you
be
litigating
the
same
issue
that
were
litigated
in
the
abandonment
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
it
find
that
the
public
interest
and
necessity
did
not
require
the
use
of
the
railroad?
unknown
speaker
but
now
it'll
have
to
find
that
the
public
interest
and
necessity
requires
that
it
be
started
again?
unknown
speaker
after
the
abandonment,
can
the
carrier
sell
the
property
to
you?
unknown
speaker
does
it
need
icc
approval?
unknown
speaker
did
your
client
make
any
effect
to
buy
the
property
from
the
carrier?
unknown
speaker
suppose
as
part
of
the
balance
that
you
spoke
of
that
the
commission
arrives
at
it
was
determined
or
it
was
proposed
by
the
railroad
and
approved
by
the
icc
that
rails
were
going
to
be
taken
up
and
used
in
another
segment
by
the
carrier
and
that
was
in
contemplation.
what
about
that,
just
about
the
rails?
would
they
then
be
subject
to
condemnation?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
this
one.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
is
hayfield
in
any
different
position
from
a
brand
new
carrier
that
wants
to,
or
corporation,
that
wants
to
start
a
railroad?
unknown
speaker
mr.
abdalian,
did
the
same
shippers
group
which
had
applied
under
the
staggers
act
proceeding
to
acquire
the
proposed
abandoned
line
from
the
hayfield
northern
railroad
company?
is
that
the
same
group
essentially?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
the
value
placed
on
the
property
will
be
different
under
the
state
condemnation
proceeding
than
it
was
under
the
proceeding
under
this...
before
the
icc?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
likely
to
differ
substantially
from
the
value
placed
in
the
icc
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
how
long
do
those
opportunity
costs
run,
forever?
unknown
speaker
would
that
still
be
true
ten
years
from
now?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
as
to
this
particular
property,
if
there
is
an
opportunity,
how
long
will
that
exist?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
over.
unknown
speaker
so
it
doesn't
exist.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
mr.
levy,
that
at
the
present
time,
once
the
icc
has
acted
and
there
is
no
longer
a
railroad,
that
the
minnesota
railroad
and
warehouse
commission
would
have
no
authority
to
tell
them
they
must
run
an
intrastate
line?
unknown
speaker
they're
subject
to,
but
could
the
minnesota
railroad
and
warehouse
commission
have
any
authority
at
all
with
respect
to
ordering
the
continuance
of
this
line?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
question.
would
the
icc
have
the
authority
to
condition
the
abandonment
on
the
transfer
of
the
rails
to
another
location?
unknown
speaker
part
of
its
balance
of
why
it
was
willing
to
allow
the
abandonment.
unknown
speaker
does
it
over
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
case
is
still
pending
in
the
second
circuit.
unknown
speaker
it's
been
pending
there
for
20
years.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
you've
mentioned
equipment
several
times.
is
equipment
at
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
only
the
rail
and
real
estate--
unknown
speaker
--only
the
land
and
the
rail,
which
i
suppose
must
be
viewed
as
a
fixture,
are
at
issue?
unknown
speaker
ms.
keating,
at
the
outset
will
you
explain
to
me
why
the
railroad
is
opposing
this.
the
railroad
wanted
to
abandon
this
line.
unknown
speaker
i
quite
understand
why
the
railroad
would
wish
to
abandon
a
line
on
which
it
was
losing
a
lot
of
money.
but
now
that
the
line
has
been
abandoned
at
the
request
of
the
railroad,
why
do
you
object
to
it
being
sold
to
somebody
else?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
you
like
to
keep
the
shippers
feeding
on
a
feeder
line?
wouldn't
that
help
your
railroad?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
you're
afraid
you'll
get
a
lower
price
under
state
condemnation?
unknown
speaker
what
has
your
client
got
to
lose,
specifically,
if
he
loses?
unknown
speaker
you've
received
that?
unknown
speaker
as
of
now,
you
could
use
it
elsewhere.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
only
about
the
rail,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wasn't
that
all
taken
up
in
the
icc
in
the
abandonment?
unknown
speaker
i
get
the
impression
that
somebody
made
a
mistake
in
the
abandonment,
namely
the
railroad.
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
a
mistake?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
get
in
the
condemnation
the
fair
value
of
the
rails,
why
don't
you
come
out
ever?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
covered
by
the
bond?
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
lawsuit
on
the
bond
if
you
win,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you
ultimately
win
you
would
get
the
property.
you
just
get
the
damage
for
delay.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
rail's
gone,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
condemnation
action
isn't
going
to
condemn
the
rail,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
going
to
keep
the
rail
anyway,
in
any
event.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
still
wants
to
condemn
whatever
is
there,
i
take
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
the
north
western
after
the
line
has
been
abandoned
should
be
immune
from
the
vicissitudes
of
state
condemnation
action
like
delay
that
every
other
property
owner
in
minnesota
is
subjected
to?
unknown
speaker
what
if
hayfield
had
made
its
move
three
years
after
the
abandonment
certificate,
and
the
north
western
was
just
doing
nothing
with
its
rails.
would
the
case
be
any
different
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
is
part
of
your
case
right
now
that
the
right
of
way...
you
still
own
some
real
estate,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
is
part
of
your
case
that
minnesota
may
not
condemn
or
that
hayfield
may
not
condemn
the
right
of
way?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
yes
or
no
case,
answer?
are
you
claiming
that
your
right
of
way,
your
real
estate,
after
the
track's
all
off,
is
not
subject
to
condemnation?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
railroad,
that
rail
line,
is
not
intact
now.
unknown
speaker
the
rail
is
off
and
the
ties
are
gone.
so
is
that
piece
of
real
estate
subject
to
condemnation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
but
again,
would
you
say...
suppose
as
this
case
developed
no
move
was
made
until
your
rails
were
all
gone,
your
ties
were
all
gone,
and
all
that
was
there
was
a
piece
of
real
estate,
and
then
hayfield
was
organized
and
sought
to
condemn
that
right
of
way.
would
you
have
come
in
in
defense
and
said
preemption
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer
is
no?
unknown
speaker
how
is
this
land
on
which
the
rails
formerly
rested
any
different
from
the
farms
on
either
side
of
the
right
of
way?
i
assume
there
are
a
lot
of
farms
in
that
part
of
the
state.
how
is
it
any
different
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
rule
against
your
position
will
it
go
back
and
be
litigated
on
the
question
of
whether
your
client
has
violated
the
injunction
or
something?
what
will
it
go
back
on,
if
you
don't
dispute
that
they
can
acquire
the
roadbed
for
the
railroad?
unknown
speaker
and
the
track
was
removed
after
the
injunction
issued?
unknown
speaker
so
what
would
be
litigated,
whether
chicago
&
north
western
transportation
company
violated
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
you
violated
no
rule
by
moving
tracks.
unknown
speaker
and
the
real
question
is
whether
the
other
side
has
to
pay
you.
if
the
other
side
wins
and
you
lose,
then
you're
not
going
to
get
any
damages
under
the
injunction--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
bond.
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
will
just
be
over.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
as
i'm
a
little
fuzzy
on
the
facts,
the
abandonment
order
as
i
understand
it
was
entered
in
late
1981.
when
actually
were
the
rails
removed?
unknown
speaker
and
did
it
go
forward
from
march
of
'82
just
as
promptly
as
it
normally
would?
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
really
held
up
for
about
a
year,
is
what
it
amounts
to.
unknown
speaker
and
then
after
february
'83
you
did
go
ahead
and
remove
the
rail.
was
the
injunction...
did
you
say
that
the
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court...
and
that
was
against
you
and
in
favor
of
hayfield,
the
injunction,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
was
that
stayed
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
the
disposition
of
the
merits
in
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
dissolved
the
injunction.
unknown
speaker
and
the
injunction
enjoined
you
from
removing
your
property?
unknown
speaker
disposing.
unknown
speaker
so
since
the
bond
issue
is
still
in
the
case,
we're
really
judging
it
just
as
though
the
track
had
never
been
removed
up
'til
this
day,
and
whether
or
not
the--
unknown
speaker
--we
judge
it
just
as
though
the
track
was
still
there,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
track
is
subject
to
condemnation.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter
your
position
is,
i
gather
that
the
abandonment
order
requires
everybody
to
allow
you
a
reasonable
time
to
remove
the
rails.
if
you
had
that
time,
you
wouldn't
care
what
happened
after
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
normally
would
take--
unknown
speaker
--five
or
six
months,
is
that
what
would
normally
be...
what
is
the
normal
length
of
time
it
would
take
to
remove
rail?
of
course,
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
long
the
railroad
is,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
winter,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
ms.
keating,
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
minnesota
shippers
who
went
before
the
icc
are
simply
the
same
people
in
another
guise
as
hayfield,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
get
your
position.
as
i
understand,
you
say
they're
the
same,
really
the
same
people.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying
they
have
an
option
under
the
abandonment
procedure
under
the
staggers
act,
and
once
having
availed
themselves
of
that,
which
they
did,
and
getting
a
valuation
with
which
they
were
dissatisfied,
they
were,
what,
estopped,
somehow
barred
by
preemption
doctrine
from
going
into
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
your
position,
is
that,
having
gone
into
the
icc
and
gotten
an
evaluation
under
the
icc
procedures
under
the
staggers
act,
an
evaluation
with
which
they
were
not
satisfied,
they
didn't
appeal
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
saying,
in
consequence,
having
taken
advantage
of
the
federal
procedure,
they
are
somehow
estopped,
barred
somehow,
from
going
into
state
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
why
you
say
this
is
an
interference
with
the
preemption
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
had
never
taken
advantage
of
10905,
if
that
had
not
happened,
all
they
had
done
was
what
they
have
since
done,
organize
to
start
a
new
railroad,
would
you
be
making
the
same
preemption
argument?
unknown
speaker
has
to
go
that
route.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
problem
is
the
icc
does
not
agree
with
you
on
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
with
the
papers
that
are
before
us
the
icc
does
not
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
decide
what
i
think
it
says?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
well,
i
take
it
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
agrees;
that
if
it
were
clear
enough
in
the
icc's
disposition
of
the
abandonment
proceeding
that
the
abandonment
was
conditioned
upon
or
rested
upon
the
use
of
the
rail
elsewhere
on
the
line,
that
this
would
be
a
different
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
says,
whatever
kind
of
a
finding
there
was,
it
isn't
sufficient
to
foreclose
the
use,
the
condemnation
of
the
rail.
unknown
speaker
and
the
icc
comes
along
and
says,
well,
whatever
we
found,
we
certainly
didn't
intend
to
foreclose
condemnation
of
the
rail
immediately
after
the
certificate
issues,
and
it
says,
we
certainly
didn't
contemplate
insulating
this
rail
for
any
period
of
time
from
condemnation.
you
disagree
with
the
icc
as
to
the
meaning
of
its
order?
unknown
speaker
an
intact
rail
line.
