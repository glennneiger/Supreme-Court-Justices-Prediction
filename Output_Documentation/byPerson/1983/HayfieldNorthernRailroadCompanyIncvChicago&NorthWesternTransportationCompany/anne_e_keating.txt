ms.
anne
e.
keating
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
we
feel
that
congress,
in
enacting
section
10905
of
the
staggers
rail
act,
balanced
several
interests.
it
balanced
the
condition,
the
financial
condition,
of
the
railroad
industry.
congress
had
found
that
the
railroad
industry
by
1985
would
have
a
$16
to
$20
billion
capital
shortfall.
it
found
that
the
railroad
industry
had
the
lowest
earnings
of
any
of
the
transportation
modes
in
the
united
states.
so
there
was
a
balancing
of
interests
of
the
railroad
versus
an
ability
on
the
part
of
the
local
communities
via
section
10905
to
acquire
via
forced
sale
or
condemnation--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe...
first
of
all,
i
should
preface
that
there
has
been
previous
indications
in
the
record
that
the
principals
and
incorporators
of
the
hayfield
northern
railroad,
the
appellant,
were
members
of
this
minnesota
shippers
group
that
invoked
section
10905
before
the
commission.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
your
honor,
in
the
meantime...
when
we
received
abandonment
authority,
at
that
point
the
finding
is
put
into
the
federal
register.
simultaneously
there's
a
notice
that
says,
anyone
interested
in
offering
to
subsidize
or
purchase
the
line
should
do
so
within
ten
days.
these
are
the
section
10905
proceedings.
the
principals
and
incorporators
of
the
hayfield
northern
invoked
section
10905,
had
the
commission
set
the
price,
and
they
chose
to
not
appeal
that
valuation.
then
they
chose
to
wait
'til
the
certificate
of
abandonment
issued
and
then
come
back
into
state
court,
basically
subverting
the
federal
agency
final
decision,
rather
than
taking
it
to
an
appellate
court.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
your
honor,
that
is
a
possibility.
but
in
the
meantime,
we
believe
this
entire
proceeding
is
a
good
indication
of
the
congressional
intent
in
enacting
section
10905.
the
legislative
history
suggests
it
was
a
balancing
between
allowing
the
sincere
efforts
of
shippers
to
acquire
property,
but
at
the
same
time--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--your
honor,
in
the
meantime
from
receiving
our
final
abandonment
certificate,
which
was
in
november--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes,
sir.
we
in
march
of
that
year,
which
is
the
earliest
you
can
get
out
to
do
some
construction
work
in
minnesota,
we
were
up
to
salvage
the
line.
in
the
meantime
we
had,
in
reliance
on
our
final
abandonment
certificate,
had
entered
into
contracts
with
the
state
of
iowa
and
other
shippers
to
upgrade
major
grain-hauling
lines
with
that
rail.
the
particular
rail
that
was
in
the
segment,
the
hayfield
segment,
was
particularly
heavy-duty
rail
which
was
susceptible
to
being
used
elsewhere.
so
we
had
committed
that
to
upgrade
our
tracks
elsewhere.
the
115-pound
rail
which
was
in
this
segment,
if
put
into
the
state
projects
in
iowa,
where
there
were
slow
orders
of
10
to
15
miles
an
hour,
we
would
be
able
to
get
the
speed
up
on
these
major
grain-hauling
lines.
and
this
kind
of
commitment
to
reuse
our
assets
is
very
important
to
the
railroad.
at
the
time
of
this
proceeding,
we
had
a
$21
million
capital
deficit,
deficit
as
to
working
capital
deficit,
and
as
a
result
this
kind
of
reuse
of
our
materials
to
better
use
it
elsewhere
for
the
general
shipping
public
we
feel
is
very
important.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
sir.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
we
have...
but
we
had
a
considerable
delay
as
a
result
of
these
proceedings,
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
10905
suggests
that
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
protracted
legal
proceedings
that
we
can
get
involved
in
and
as
a
result
not
be
able
to
reuse
our
materials.
the
federal
courts
as
well
as
the
commission
have
indicated
that
there
is
an
opportunity
cost
associated
with
not
being
able
to
use
your
assets
to
the
best
of
your
ability.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor,
it
was
115-pound
rail,
which
was
very
reusable.
in
the
specific
finding
of
the
commission
they
determined
95
percent
of
all
the
rail
on
the
whole
line
was
reusable,
and
there
were
over
200,000
ties
that
were
reusable.
but
given
the
financial
condition
of
the
rail
industry,
this
ability
to
reuse
the
materials
on
lines
that
have
not
been
used
or
are
underutilized
is
very
important
in
terms
of
being
able
to
provide
better
service
elsewhere
on
our
system.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
your
honor,
we
submit
that
section--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--no,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor--
we
felt
we
could
rely
on
the
final
commission
decision
authorizing
the
abandonment.
the
administrative
law
judge
stated
in
his
commission
that
the
railroad
had
shown
a
need
for
reusable
materials
elsewhere
on
the
system,
and
except
for
someone
acquiring
it
under
the
provisions
provided
by
congress
under
10905,
we
thought
we
could
rely
on
those...
that
final
decision
and
then
be
free
to
reuse
our
materials
elsewhere.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
eighth
circuit
has
indicated
that
there's
a
delay
that
could
be
caused,
because
we
have
to
remember
that
in
this
situation,
though
the
hayfield
northern
obtained
its
temporary
restraining
order
in
april
of
1982,
it
has
yet
to
file
a
condemnation
action.
this
kind
of
delay
in
terms
of
having
our
assets
remain
unproductive
could
cause
the
railroad
considerable--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--your
honor,
we
had
in
the
state
court--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--we
had
in
the
state
court
a
$2,000
bond,
and
a
$100,000
bond
was
issued
in
the
eighth
circuit
for
property
that
was
valued
at
the
commission
at
$1.7
million.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
in
this
particular
instance,
there
was
the
temporary
restraining
order.
but
in
condemnation
actions
per
se,
there
is
not
necessarily
an
indication
that
we
would
get
anything
more
than
our
cost
for
defending
ourselves
in
these
perhaps
numerous
condemnation
actions
in
the
various
counties
that
the
line
might
go
through.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
at
this
point,
your
honor,
the
major
controversy
i
expect
would
be
whether
the
injunction
was
proper
to
begin
with
and
whether
or
not
there
are
damages
that
should
be
available
to
the
railroad
as
a
result
of
the
delay.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
the
rail
has
been
reused,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
this
is
what
counsel
for
appellant
has
indicated,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
well,
we
believe
that
the
federal
system
that
was
created
under
10905
is
a
separate
and
unique
system
and
that
is
the
exclusive
method
for
continued
rail
service.
and
they
have
indicated
in
the
memorandum
of
law
that
was
submitted
to
the
state
court
in
obtaining
its
temporary
restraining
order
that
it
was
for
continued
rail
purposes
that
they
wanted
it,
and
they
wanted
to
prevent
us
from
removing
our
track.
so
we're
saying
that
this
is
a
subterfuge
or
circumvention
of
the
federal
orders,
which
they
had
an
opportunity
or
day
in
court,
so
to
speak--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
history
of
our
abandonments...
and
we've,
in
the
last
15
years,
had
several
thousand
miles
of
abandonments...
we
have
always
attempted
to
remove
our
materials
as
quickly
as
possible.
so
i
don't
think
we'd
get
into
that
situation
where
it
would
be
three
years
down
the
line.
i
think
that
that
hypothetical
would
indicate
that
we
would
act
contrary
to
our
best
economic
interests.
the
opportunity
costs
associated
with
keeping
the
rail
assets
idle,
as
determined
by
the
commission,
in
this
particular
segment
was
around
$180,000
a
year,
and
as
the
facts
before
the
eighth
circuit
indicated,
we
as
soon
as
possible
were
there
to
try
to
remove
our
tracks
and
reuse
them.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
well,
i
think--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--we're
talking
about
an
intact
rail
line,
that
is
the
procedure
of
10905.
so
i
would
say--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--i
agree
with
you.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
it
would
be
subject
to
condemnation.
it
would
be
a
different
issue
in
terms
of,
not
being
preemption,
but
those
same
parties
were
before
the
commission
and,
rather
than
taking
their
final
appeal
as
to
the
valuation--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--no,
your
honor,
because
section
10905--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
at
this
point
in
time,
your
honor,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
had
been
a
prior
abandonment...
had
been
a
prior
railroad
right
of
way,
there
wouldn't
be
any
difference.
but
when
the
proceeding
was
instituted
and
was
before
the
eighth
circuit,
it
was
an
intact
rail
line
and
that
is
where
the
preemption
issue
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
today
was
focused.
it
was
at
that
point
an
intact
rail
line
and
at
that
point
there
was
a
similar...
there
was
an
exclusive
method
in
the
federal
law
to
provide
for
local
communities
to
be
able
to
acquire
via
forced
sale
or
subsidy
an
intact
rail
line.
this
state
method
acts
as
a
direct
conflict
to
that
federal
method.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
the
injunction
was
as
a
result
of
the
eighth
circuit
deciding
there
was
a
delay
caused
by
the
hayfield
northern,
and
it
was
basically
on
the
preemption
issue
which
was
before
the
court.
at
that
time
it
was
an
intact
rail
line.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
when
the
mandate
issued
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
the
hayfield
requested
that
there
be
a
rehearing
en
banc
and
also
a
rehearing,
and
they
were
denied.
and
it
was...
i
believe
it
was
justice
blackmun
and
other
members
of
the
court,
where
they
also
requested
a
stay,
and
that
was
denied.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
no.
at
that
point
there
was
not
an
injunction
on
us,
your
honor.
at
that
point
the
injunction
via
the
eighth
circuit's
order
had
been--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--no.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
mr.
justice.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
i
guess
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
your
honor,
the
railroad
instituted
its
salvaging
process
of
the
line
in
march
of
1982,
as
it
was
attempting
to
remove
the
rail
and
the
assets
to
attempt
to
use
it
elsewhere.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
we
were
stopped
the
day
that
we
were
up
at
hayfield
to
attempt
to
remove
that
property,
because
the
hayfield
northern,
the
principals
and
incorporators
who
had
been
this
minnesota
shippers
group,
incorporated
themselves
as
the
hayfield
northern,
went
into
state
court,
got
a
temporary
restraining
order,
and
from
that
point
on
we
were
not
able
to
remove
our
property
and
it
sat
idle
until
the
mandate
of
the
eighth
circuit
issued,
february
of
'83.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
there
was
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the...
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case.
we
had
removed
it
to
the
district
court.
it
dismissed
it
based
on
the
preemption
of
section
10905.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
and
dissolved
the
injunction.
however,
in
the
meantime
the
hayfield
northern
had
gone
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
there
was
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
a
bond
should
be
set,
and
at
that
point
they
set
a
bond
and
the
injunction
came
back
into
force.
so
it
basically
was,
there
was
continuity
there
in
terms
of
an
injunction
basically
the
entire
time.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
from
disposing,
selling--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--reusing
any
of
the
assets.
and
that
remained
in
force
until
the
mandate
of
the
eight
circuit
issued.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
because
if
the
injunction--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes,
your
honor.
if
the
injunction
was
properly
issued,
then
the
bond...
we
would
not
be
able
to
have
damages
on
the
bond,
and
that
would
be
basically
the
question
of
preemption
and
collateral
attack
that
we
had
submitted
to
the
district
court
and
the
eight
circuit
below.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
an
exclusive
method
that
has
been
added
to
the
abandonment
process,
and
that's
section
10905--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--which
gave
the--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--depending
on
where
you're
at.
in
our
particular
section,
we
are
in
the
midwest,
and
if
you're
allowed
to--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--you
will
be
in
your
regular
construction
season.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
counsel
for
appellants
have
indicated
that
they
are
separate
legal
entities.
however,
the
principals...
some
of
the
principals
and
incorporators--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
they
had
the
ability
to
have
that
valuation
appealed--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
we
believe
it
would
be
a
collateral
attack
against
that
final
order
of
the
commission
that
set
the
valuation
of
the
line
at
$1.7
million.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
that,
and
in
addition,
under
section
10905,
which
was
invoked
in
the
staggers
rail
act
of
1980,
there
was
another
provision.
it
not
only
set
the
time
periods
in
which
these
offers
were
to
be
made
as
far
as
a
forced
sale
or
subsidy.
it
also
provided
that
anyone
that
purchased
the
line
should
continue
service
for
a
minimum
of
two
years.
that
was
an
extra
stiff
requirement
to
continue
the
service,
and
we
believe
that
it
evinces
the
congressional
intent
for
there
to
be
stability
in
the
rail
system
and
for
there
to
be
continuity.
so
section
10905
regulated
that
entire
area,
and
there
is
no
indication--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
notice
that's
put
in
the
federal
register,
a
notice
stating,
anyone
who
is
interested
in
subsidizing--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--yes.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
well,
your
honor,
there
is--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--a
difference
of
opinion,
as
i
understand
it,
among
the
commission
members
and
they
did
not
join
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
and
have
not
entered
the
case
as
a
party
of
record.
but
i
think
that
we
should
note
that
the
commission--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
among
their
decisions.
they
have
indicated
that
they
understand
what
opportunity
costs
are
and
that
there
is
a
real
cost
to
the
railroads
in
terms
of
not
being
able
to
use
their
assets
productively.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
well,
one
of
the
findings
that's
made
in
every
abandonment
case
now
is
the
opportunity
costs
associated
with
not
being
able
to
productively
use
one's
assets.
so
there
was
a
specific
finding
in
the
commission
proceedings.
and
while
the
certificate
issue--
ms.
anne
e.
keating
--we
would
submit
that
there
are
sufficient
statement
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
decision.
ms.
anne
e.
keating
i
believe
that
the
order

that
congress
is
the
one
that
has
established
that
any
forced
sale
or
acquisition
of
a
rail
line,
an
intact
rail
line
for
continued
rail
purposes,
should
be
done
under
section

which
it
was
when
the
hayfield
northern
obtained
the
temporary
restraining
order
in
state
court.
the
icc,
we
believe,
cannot
abdicate
its
role
as
guardianship
over
the
railroads'
financial
condition,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
primary
purposes
behind
the
staggers
rail
act,
which
provided
for
section
10905,
and
that
was
to
deregulate
the
railroad
industry
and
to
provide
lesser
regulatory
restraints,
but
also
to
give
the
railroad
an
opportunity
to
have
the
earnings
so
that
it
could
restore
and
maintain
its
rail
system
and
thus
provide
better
rail
service
for
the
nation;
and
then
finally,
to
provide
for
stability
in
the
rail
system
of
the
nation.
and
section
10905
as
a
result
was
a
balancing
test
to
provide
this
means
by
which
within
a
certain
time
period
local
communities
could
have
the
opportunity
of
acquiring
lines
and
being
able
to
continue
service,
but
at
the
same
time
there
could
not
be
this
protracted
delay
from
letting
the
railroads
reuse
their
assets
productively
elsewhere.
