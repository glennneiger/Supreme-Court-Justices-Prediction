mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
holding
that
section
10905
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
preempts
minnesota
condemnation
law
when
that
law
is
applied
to
property
which
has
been
abandoned
with
icc
approval
after
the
icc
has
relinquished
all
jurisdiction
and
interest
in
that
line
and
where
a
statutorily
authorized
minnesota
public
service
corporation
seeks
to
take
that
line
by
eminent
domain
in
order
to
restore
rail
service
to
a
rural
minnesota
community.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
that's
correct.
there's
still
land
and
right
of
way
to
take,
justice
blackmun,
and
there's
also
a
bond
at
issue.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
the
legal
issue
before
this
court
has
been
well
defined
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
factual
context
in
which
this
case
comes
to
this
court
is
uncomplicated.
cnw,
the
appellee,
applied
to
abandon
a
line
of
rail
that
ran
from
iowa
to
minnesota.
part
of
that
line
is
the
19.2
mile
segment
that
lies
totally
within
minnesota,
which
has
been
referred
to
in
all
briefs
as
the
hayfield
segment.
the
abandonment
was
contested
by
a
shippers
group.
the
challenge
to
the
abandonment
was
unsuccessful.
the
abandonment
also
was
challenged
by
a
shippers
group
in
way
that
the
line
could
avoid
abandonment
through
a
procedure
within
the
commerce
act
itself
to
subsidize
the
line
and
keep
that
line
in
interstate
commerce.
the
shippers
group
made
an
offer
of
subsidy
to
continue
the
line
in
rail
service,
and
that
subsidy
offer
was
not
accepted
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
set
a
subsidy
amount.
the
shippers
group
withdrew
their
offer
of
subsidy
and
the
shippers
group
disbanded.
several
months
later...
the
abandonment
became
final
in
december
of
1981.
several
months
later
the
hayfield
northern
was
formed,
a
minnesota
public
service
corporation
with
the
delegated
power
of
eminent
domain
to
condemn
right
of
way
and
track
for
rail
use.
upon
the
founding
of
the
hayfield
northern,
the
hayfield
northern
immediately
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
state
court
in
order
to
keep
the
line
intact,
as
the
appellee
had
already
commenced
procedures
to
dismantle
the
track.
the
tro
was
granted
by
the
state
court
after
a
hearing.
the
cnw
then
removed
this
case
to
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
action
with
prejudice
and
dissolved
the
injunction.
an
appeal
was
immediately
taken
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
the
order
of
the
district
court
upon
the
posting
of
a
bond.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court.
there
are
two
issues
that
i
wish
to
emphasize
this
morning:
that
is,
the
difference
between
pre-abandonment
and
post-abandonment
matters;
and
that
section
10905
is
not
the
exclusive
method
in
which
to
transfer
property.
it
is
common
ground
in
this
case
and
all
parties
agree
that
if
the
state
of
minnesota
or
the
hayfield
northern
or
any
other
entity
would
take
any
action
that
would
affect
a
common
carrier's
status
as
a
common
carrier
that
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
commerce
act.
however,
by
the
act
of
abandonment,
the
railroad
being
certified
abandoned,
the
cnw,
that
points
to
the
end
of
interstate
commerce
commission
jurisdiction
and
federal
interest.
at
the
point
of
consummation
no
longer
do
we
have
anything
of
federal
interest,
it
is
a
matter
of
federal
indifference,
and
state
power
can
be
exercised
on
that
line,
including
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
if
allowed
to
stand,
allows
a
gap
in
sovereignty
to
occur.
this
line
of
rail
is
not
subject
to
state
power
or
to
federal
power
or
federal
interests,
and
it
just
exists
out
there.
there
is
a
gap.
it
is
a
no
man's
land
creating
a
void.
the
commerce
commission
itself
has
held
repeatedly
in
public
rulings
that
once
the
certificate
of
abandonment
has
issued
that
is
the
end
of
federal
interest,
and
that
questions
of
title
to
and
and
disposition
of
rail
property
are
a
matter
of
state
power,
a
matter
of
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
thus
changed
what
was
considered
to
be
the
law
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself,
the
agency
that
is
in
charge
of
enforcing
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
section
10905,
because
there
is
a
provision
in
which
rail
property
can
be
transferred,
whether
that
be
by
subsidy
or
acquisition
and
that
the
commerce
commission
could
set
a
price,
that
somehow
this
became
the
exclusive
and
only
method.
but
the
act
itself
speaks,
section
10905
speaks,
to
matters
that
all
happened
before
abandonment,
before
the
abandonment
has
been
consummated.
and
the
title
of
the
act
is
particularly
instructive.
it
speaks
of
methods
of
avoiding
abandonment,
in
avoidance
of
abandonment.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
it
as
the
exclusive
method
to
transfer
property
for
continued
rail
service
in
connection
with
abandonment.
while,
that's
true,
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
in
avoidance
of
abandonment,
and
that
once
the
abandonment
is
final
then
there
is
no
longer
any
federal
interest
that
exists,
that
the
states
are
free
to...
a
state
is
free
to
exercise
its
power.
there
is
no
reason
to
subordinate
a
state
interest
at
that
time
to
that
of
a
private
carrier,
as
there
is
no
federal
interest,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
that
there
is
no
programmatic
interest
of
the
united
states
that
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain
on
this
line
of
rail.
it's
consistent--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
that's
correct.
by
the
act
of
abandonment
it
loses
its
character
as
interstate
rail
property.
it's
no
longer
in
interstate
commerce.
it
becomes
ordinary
mere
property,
subject
to
the
laws
of
minnesota,
just
like
any
other
property
or
any
other
property
owner.
to
use
the
fact
that
it
once
was
rail
property
in
interstate
commerce
to
shield
itself
from
condemnation
is
unprincipled.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
very
tight
time
constraints
in
this
transfer
to
subsidy
pursuant
to
section
10905
would
somehow
be
lost
by
a
state
condemnation
because
you
would
have
protracted
condemnation
proceedings.
but
the
110-day
period
in
which
the
commission
will
set
a
price
and
the
transfer
of
the
property
would
take
place
is
not
at
all
affected
by
the
state
condemnation.
that
110-day
period
will
come
to
end
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
federal
jurisdiction.
it
has
come
to
an
end
and
the
railroad
is
able
to
abandon
that
property,
and
that's
all
that
the
commission
can...
that's
the
extent
of
the
commission's
authority.
it
has
the
permissive
power
to
permit
the
abandonment
if
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits.
there
is
no
other
power.
the
commission
has
not
stated
by
giving
the
certificate
of
abandonment
that
the
railroad
is
entitled
to
those
assets
after
the
certificate
issues
in
any
set
of
circumstances,
or
that
the
state
power
of
eminent
domain
is
going
to
be
subordinated
to
that
of
the
private
carrier.
once
the
certificate
issues
it
is
at
an
end.
and
that
is
consistent
with
federal
policy
also,
to
bring
the
states
to
the
forefront
of
restoring
rail
service.
we
are
not,
the
hayfield
northern
is
not,
attempting
to
continue
rail
service
on
this
line.
fail
service
cannot
be
continued,
which
it
would
be
under
10905.
10905
is
a
method
in
which
the
rail
line
can
continue
in
service.
here
service
has
been
discontinued,
the
community
has
lost
its
service,
and
now
a
state
condemnation
wishes
not
to
continue
it
but
to
recommended
and
restore
rail
service
on
that
line.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
that's
correct,
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
and
we
would
have
to--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--that's
correct,
that's
correct.
you'd
have
to
apply
anew
under
section
10901
of
the
commerce
act
and
show
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits
the
line
to
be--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--no,
not
at
all.
because
the
abandonment
is
only
permissive,
the
commission
has
not
made
an
affirmative
finding.
the
abandonment
proceeding--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--that's
correct.
that's
right.
it's
required
to
prevent
the
abandonment
and
to--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--not
required,
but
permits,
which
is
an
easier
standard
under
the
act.
the
local
interest
in
this
line...
the
abandonment
itself,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
goes
through
a
balance,
balancing
the
interests
of
the
private
carrier
in
interstate
commerce
generally
on
the
one
hand
and
that
of
the
public,
the
local
community
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
the
carrier
can
sell
the
property
if
a
state
interest
doesn't
surface.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
it
does
not
need
icc
approval.
once
the
certificate
issues,
it's
a
matter
of
icc
indifference.
the
rail
line
is
taken
off
the
carrier's
book
for
interstate
commerce
matters.
it's
the
end
of
federal
jurisdiction,
and
to
find
a
conflict
between
state
and
federal
law
where
there
is
no
federal
interest--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--no,
not
at
all.
there
was
a
shippers
group,
a
shippers
group
that
opposed
the
abandonment
for
substantive
reasons,
and
then
there
was
a
shippers
group
that
sought
to
have
the
line
avoid
abandonment
through
the
vehicles
of
running
the
railroad
on
a
subsidized
basis.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
conditioned
the
abandonment
on
the
cnw's
taking
its
rail
lines
and
taking
it
from
hayfield
someplace
else
because
interstate
commerce
interests
required
that,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
that's
not
this
case--
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
--and
that
would
be
an
interference
with
the
commission's
order.
where
this
does
not
interfere
with
any
order
of
the
commission
at
all.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
no,
it's
not.
there
were
two
shippers
group.
one
was
made
up
of
12,
i
believe,
shippers
that
protested
the
abandonment
on
substantive
grounds;
the
second,
a
group
of
seven
that
decided
to
subsidize
it.
and
this
is
a
separate
legal
entity,
a
minnesota
public
service
corporation
that
seeks
to
restore
rail
service,
which
is
quite
different
than
what
both
of
the
other
two
groups
sought
to
accomplish.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
the
state
condemnation
proceeding
is
constrained
by
fair
market
value,
and
we
have,
since
the
icc
valuation,
we've
had
intervening
events.
but
the
carrier
is
entitled
to
fair
market
value
and
just
compensation
under
minnesota
condemnation
law,
and
of
course
must
be
because
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
it
could
differ.
but
the
state
court
would
apply
state
condemnation
principles,
and
whether
that
would
be
different
or
not
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
that
would
depend
on
record
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
state
condemnation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
s.
abdalian
if
there
is
a
reasonable
time
in
which
the
rail
ties
and
track
should
be
left
intact...
or
not
intact;
in
which
the
cnw
could
remove
the
rail
ties,
that
should
have
been
asked.
the
commission
should
have
been
asked
to
put
a
condition
on
the
abandonment,
and
that's
where
that
should
have
been
fought
out.
the
railroad
did
not
have
a
condition
of
the
abandonment
that
they
needed
the
lines
and
they
had
to
put
it
elsewhere.
the
reason
that
there
was
no
condemnation
action
or
petition
for
condemnation
action
brought
was
because
immediately
upon
seeking
the
tro
in
state
court
the
issue
was
removed
to
federal
court
on
a
preemption
issue,
which
was
perceived
as
a
threshold
issue.
and
to
bring
a
condemnation
action
in
state
court
while
this
threshold
issue
had
to
be
decided
would
be
premature
and
it
was
likely
not
to
be
entertained
by
the
state
court
in
any
event
pending
a
resolution
of
this
jurisdictional
issue.
as
for
the
estoppel
argument
of
the
cnw,
estoppel
would
not
prevent
the
condemnation.
at
most
it
goes
to
the
price
that
was
placed
on
the
line.
it's
an
issue
preclusion
consideration
and
not
one
of
preemption.
thank
you.
