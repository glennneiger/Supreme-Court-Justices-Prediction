mr.
grant
s.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
the
fcc's
legal
arguments,
there
are
a
number
of
additional
facts
that
i
think
should
be
called
to
the
court's
attention
to
put
this
litigation
in
its
proper
context.
in
the
mid-1970's
there
was
a
significant
disagreement
between
the
fcc
and
representatives
of
european
governments
as
to
the
nature
of
the
facilities
that
should
be
constructed
to
handle
the
increasing
trans-atlantic
communications
traffic.
basically,
the
fcc
favored
use
of
satellites,
the
european
governments
favored
the
use
of
cable.
as
a
result
of
the
give
and
take
of
the
consultative
process,
meetings
which
had
been
going
on,
the
fcc
basically
agreed
to
defer
to
the
europeans
and
authorized
the
construction
of
so-called
tat,
for
trans-atlantic,
7,
the
tat-7
cable.
now,
at
about
the
same
time
the
fcc,
which
of
course
for
many
years
has
sought
to
foster
domestic
competition
in
the
provision
of
communications
services,
also
sought
to
apply
these
policies
to
the
international
arena
and,
in
a
significant
departure
from
prior
practice,
it
authorized
a
number
of
new
companies
to
provide
international
service,
even
though
they
had
never
entered
into
agreements
with
the
european
governments
with
which
they
would
have
to
deal.
at
about
the
time...
and
this
is
about
the
same
time.
at
the
time
of
the
tat-7
decision,
authorizing
tat-7,
commissioner
fogerty,
a
key
member
of
the
telecommunications
committee
of
the
commission,
the
committee
charged
with
its
express
delegation
of
authority
with
authorizing
construction
of
major
new
facilities,
issued
a
concurring
opinion.
he
stated
that
the
fcc
was
deferring
to
the
european
governments
even
though
he
didn't
believe
that
a
new
cable
was
appropriate.
but
he
went
on
to
say,
we
expect
the
tit
for
the
tat,
and
specifically
threatened
that
unless
the
european
governments
agreed
to
deal
with
the
new
american
carriers
the
fcc
would
not
listen
to
them
in
the
future.
this
is
october
1978.
the
text
is
set
forth
in
paragraph
8
of
our
complaint.
in
march
'79
at
a
consultative
process
meeting,
commissioner
fogerty
again
made
a
speech
seeing
the
tit
for
tat,
the
quid
pro
quo,
and
making
it
clear
he
is
not
just
speaking
for
himself
but
for
the
full
fcc.
in
may
of
1979,
chairman
ferris
of
the
commission,
and
of
course
a
member
of
the
telecommunications
committee,
testified
before
congress
that
the
commission
was
in
the
process
of
trying
to
apply
leverage
on
the
european
governments.
but
despite
all
this,
when
it
came
time
for
the
october
1979
consultative
process
meeting
in
dublin,
not
a
single
european
government
had
backed
down,
not
a
single
european
government
had
acceded
to
the
fcc
demands.
it's
at
this
point
that
the
fcc
convened
the
closed
meeting
from
which
representatives
of
the
american
carriers
were
excluded.
this
was
a
basic
departure
from
past
consultative
process
meetings,
which
were
open
to
all
interested
parties.
there's
no
question
that
this
was
done
at
the
instance
of
the
fcc.
the
fcc
so
admitted
in
its
answer
to
interrogatories
that
we
served,
which
are
contained
in
joint
appendix
page
116.
they
also
admitted
so
in
their
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
as
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
memorializes
on
page
6
of
that
decision.
the
fcc
then
called
this
special
meeting.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
were
nine
representatives
of
the
fcc,
three
commissioners,
six
members
of
commission
staff,
at
the
meeting,
as
compared
to
single
representatives
of
six
of
the
foreign
governments.
that's
in
an
interrogatory
answer
at
joint
appendix
108,
109.
itt,
being
excluded
from
this
meeting
for
the
first
time,
it's
correct,
tried
to
find
out
what
happened.
it
served
a
freedom
of
information
act
request
asking
for
documents
about
the
meeting.
and
it
also
filed
a
petition
for
rulemaking,
basically
questioning
the
wisdom
and
propriety
of
what
the
fcc
was
doing,
but
saying
that
at
the
very
least
the
commission
should
define
what
its
representatives
would
be
doing
and
establish
some
procedural
safeguards
for
the
future.
the
commission
took
no
action.
the
foia
request
was
denied
in
principal
part
by
the
common
carrier
bureau.
we
appealed
to
the
full
commission.
the
commission
did
not
act
within
the
time
required
by
statute.
the
commission
took
no
action
on
the
petition
for
rulemaking
that
we
filed.
they
did,
however,
announce
that
there
was
going
to
be
another
closed
meeting
in
england,
this
time
in
ascot.
and
at
this
point
itt
filed
the
lawsuit
that
gives
rise
to
the
argument
today.
unlike
itt's
petition
for
rulemaking,
which
focused
on
the
future,
basically
calling
on
the
fcc
to
establish
some
rules
for
the
future,
itt
basically
bit
the
bullet
and
challenged
the
past
propriety
of
what
the
commission
had
been
doing.
we
specifically
quoted
what
commissioner
fogerty
had
said
about
threatening
the
european
governments.
we
urged
and
alleged
that
such
conduct
on
behalf
of
an
american
administrative
agency
is
ultra
vines,
that
negotiations
with
foreign
governments
is
the
province
of
the
state
department,
not
a
regulatory
agency,
and
we
asked
that
that
conduct
be
enjoined.
we
also
stated
that
the
conduct
involving
the
joint
conduct
of
agency
business
was
subject
to
the
sunshine
act.
there
was
some
preliminary
discovery
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
by
the
commission.
we
cross-moved
for
summary
judgment.
pursuant
to
the
local
rule,
we
identified
eight
statements
of
the
commission,
of
its...
of
commissioners
and
of
its
general
counsel,
which
described
what
the
commission
was
doing
at
consultative
process
meetings,
what
it
proposed
to
do.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
certainly,
sir.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
justice
rehnquist,
review
of
fcc
orders
lies
with
the
court
of
appeals.
review
of
administrative
agency
action
would
lie
in
the
district
court.
we
did
take
an
appeal
when
they
denied
our
petition...
they
ultimately,
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
they
denied
our
petition
for
rulemaking,
and
we
did
take
an
appeal
from
that.
but
that
order
dealt
with
whether
the
commission
would
establish
rules
for
the
future.
it
did
not
involve
in
any
way
an
adjudication
of
the
propriety
of
its
past
conduct.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
we
get
into
the
district
court...
the
administrative
procedure
act
provides
for
review
of
agency
action
that's
not
otherwise
subject
to
review,
which
would
be
the
basis
for
going
to
the
district
court
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals
where
we're
challenging
an
action
rather
than
an
agency
order.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
we
believe
it
is,
sir,
yes.
i
will
return
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
basically
there
are
many
doctrines
that
narrow
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
where
there
will
subsequently
be
a
remedy
if
you
just
wait
and
abide
the
administrative
proceeding.
but
the
district
court
jurisdiction
is
residual.
the
fcc
basically
elected
not
to
join
issue
with
us
on
our
statement
of
undisputed
facts.
they
specifically
represented
to
the
court
that
there
were
no
material
facts
in
dispute
in
the
case,
and
that's
the
posture
then
in
which
the
case
arose
and
in
which
summary
judgment
was
granted.
the
statements
that
we
called
to
the
court's
attention,
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals,
did
not
show
general
informal
discussions,
as
the
commission
states
in
the
question
that
it
presented
to
this
court
when
it
asked
that
certiorari
be
granted.
rather,
the
statements
clearly
establish,
to
quote
them,
that
the
commission
was
in
a
negotiating
stance,
was
seeking
a
tit
for
tat
or
a
quid
pro
quo,
that
the
commission
was
applying
leverage
on
the
european
governments.
and
basically,
at
one
point
commission
fogerty
said:
well,
we're
going
to
go
overseas
and
show
we
really
mean
business.
these
are
simply
not
informal
discussions
involving
general
exchange
of
information.
with
that
background,
i'd
like
to
respond,
then,
obviously,
to
the
fcc's
arguments
as
to
why
the
sunshine
act
they
claim
should
not
apply.
we
of
course
urge
that
it
has
been
correctly
applied,
recognizing
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
there
is
to
be
a
presumption
of
openness
in
government
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
administrative
agency
to
justify
departure
from
those
principles.
the
first
point
the
fcc
argues
is
that,
and
we
all
admit,
no
question,
that
there
was
not
a
quorum
of
the
fcc
as
it
then
existed,
although
in
all
likelihood
there
will
now...
any
future
meeting
involving
the
same
three
commissioners
will
of
course
involve
a
quorum
of
the
commission
as
it
now
exists.
the
sunshine
act
is
clear
that
the
fcc
applies...
excuse
me,
the
act
applies,
not
only
to
meetings
of
an
agency,
but
to
subdivisions
of
an
agency
that
are
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
agency.
now,
the
commission's
argument
before
this
court
is
that
because
the
telecommunications
committee
was
not
expressly
authorized
to
participate
in
consultative
process
meetings
and
because
its
authority
was
limited
to
passing
on
applications
for
construction
of
major
new
facilities,
whatever
it
did
was
unauthorized
and
therefore
the
sunshine
act
can't
be
applicable.
now,
we'd
submit
there
can
be
no
serious
question
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
act.
we
alleged
in
paragraph
10
of
our
complaint,
joint
appendix
page
64,
for
several
years
representatives
of
the
fcc,
through
its
telephone
and
telegraph
committee
and
staff,
as
it
was
then
called,
have
met
with
the
canadian
and
european
telecommunications
administrations
to
discuss
facility
planning.
the
fcc's
answer
to
our
complaint,
set
forth
at
joint
appendix
73:
"defendant
admits
that
meetings
of
the
type
described
in
paragraph
10
have
occurred.
"
in
its
order
denying
our
petition
for
rulemaking,
one
of
the
statements
on
which
we
relied
in
support
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
set
forth
at
page
165
of
the
joint
appendix,
this
was
the
commission's
statement,
the
commission:
"we
have
undertaken
to
have
commission
representatives
meet
face
to
face
with
them.
"
--that
is,
representatives
of
the
foreign
governments...
"to
discuss
mutual
present
and
future
telecommunications
needs.
"
i
might
add,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
question,
commissioner
fogerty
had
no
doubt
about
his
authority
when
he
addressed
the
consultative
process
meeting
in
montreal.
at
joint
appendix
page
165:
"i
think
the
commission",
he
said...
"i
can
speak
for
myself
and
i'm
sure
for
the
chairman
and
mr.
lee.
"
--he's
the
third
member
of
the
committee...
"and
for
the
other
commissioners
who
are
not
present.
"
"we
want
to
meet
you
halfway,
but
we
do
request,
i
think,
that
the
quid
pro
quo
would
be.
"
he
clearly
advises
the
european
representatives
he
is
speaking
for
the
entire
commission.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
that
speech
obviously
is
not
decisionmaking.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
we
are
saying
that
he
is
participating
in
a
meeting.
when
he
delivered
the
speech
he
was
not
involved
in
decisionmaking.
i
am
really
simply
addressing
the
fact
that
he
recognized
his
authority,
and
the
commission
has
consistently
recognized
the
authority
of
the
telecommunications
committee:
that
as
indicated,
they
represented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
stated
that
commissioners
were
participating
in
their
official
capacity,
in
their
official
role
and
qua
the
telecommunications
committee.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
we
don't
know
what
decisions
were
made
in
dublin.
we
were
excluded
from
the
meeting.
we
do
know,
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
statement
of
undisputed
facts,
what
the
commission
said
it
would
be
trying
to
do
in
dublin.
it
would
be
seeking
a
tit
for
tat.
commissioner
fogerty
was
planning
to
go
and
show
we
really
mean
business,
to
basically
engage
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
of
the
agency.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
justice
o'connor,
when
the
agency
sends
someone
out
the
answer
is
no.
when
they
send
a
group
of
commissioners
out
to
see
to
it
that
the
decision
is
implemented,
they
are
then
involved
in
the
joint
conduct
of
agency
business.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
this
is
basically...
where
the
court
of
appeals
went
is
exactly
where
i
believe
your
honor
is
going.
namely,
it
concluded
its
analysis
on
the
question
of
authority,
whatever
the
scope
of
the
commission's
endeavors,
which
is
what
i
think
you're
addressing,
there's
no
question
that
they're
undertaken
on
behalf
of
the
commission.
let's
then
go
to
the
question,
what
were
they
doing
at
these
meetings,
something
that
the
fcc
is
avoiding
mentioning
today
before
this
court.
that's
something
they've
said
they'd
rather
not
argue,
which
we
can
understand
given
the
undisputed
statements
that
were
made
below
as
to
the
scope
of
the
activities.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
your
honor,
congress
is
not
seeking
to
subject
dublin
or
any
foreign
administration
to
the
scope
of
the
sunshine
act.
all
that
congress
has
done
is
said
that
when
the
fcc
engages
in
agency
business
that
it
doesn't
matter
where
they
do
it.
the
policies
favoring
openness
in
government
are
as
applicable
in
dublin,
if
that's
where
the
commission
goes
to
do
its
business
and
to
get
its
business
done.
i
agree,
we're
dealing
with
a
very
unusual
situation.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
nobody...
the
only
thing
congress
is
doing
is
telling
the
commission
what
to
do.
normally,
of
course,
dealings
with
foreign
governments--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--your
honor,
the
commission
closed
the
meeting.
it's
undisputed
that
the
only
reason
the
american
carriers
were
excluded
from
the
meeting
was
because
the
fcc
asked
that
that
be
done.
there's
no
question
that
this
was
totally
the
doing
of
the
commission.
interested
american
parties
have
been
participating
in
open
meetings
for
five
years,
and
it's
only
when
the
commission,
unable
to
persuade
the
europeans
to
do
what
it
wanted
to
have
done
in
the
open,
that
they
then
sought
to
go
into
the
dark
and
to
exclude
the
americans.
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
conduct
that
congress
sought
to
expose
to
the
sunlight
when
it
enacted
the
sunshine
act.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
your
honor,
i'm
equally
sure
that
congress
didn't
intend
for
representatives--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--congress
certainly
did
not
intend...
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
the
question
is
what
is
the
agency
doing,
not
where
is
it
being
done?
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
no,
your
honor.
that's
exactly...
that's
not
the
province
of
a
regulatory
agency.
that's
going
to
be
done
by
agencies
that
are
not
subject
to
the
sunshine
act.
dealings
with
foreign
governments
is
not
the
province
of
an
administrative
agency.
that's
our
ultra
vires
count,
and
we
ultimately
expect
to
establish
that
the
fcc
has
done
what
we've
alleged,
namely
engaged
in
ultra
vires
negotiations.
but
if
they're
not,
if
what
they're
doing
is
proper,
then
they're
still
engaged
in
agency
business
which
is
subject
to
the
sunshine
act.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
justice
o'connor,
the
word
"deliberation"...
i
think
the
legislative
history
on
this
is
clear
that
deliberations
simply
meant,
that
phrase
was
used
simply
to
exclude
totally
informal
contacts.
and
the
examples
that
are
given
in
the
legislative
history
are
casual
conversations
on
the
golf
course
or
at
the
lunch
table.
the
key
phrase
is
the
joint
conduct
or
disposition
of
agency
business,
and
if
the
agency
is
involved
in
decisionmaking...
i
don't
believe
the
commission
disagrees
with
this.
if
the
agency
is
actually
involved
in
decisionmaking,
then
it
should
be
done
in
the
public
or
not
at
all.
the
fcc's
proposed--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--the
fcc...
agencies
normally
don't
implement
decisions.
i
mean,
agencies
write
decisions,
they
publish
them,
and
the
decisions
speak
for
themselves.
when
the
fcc
goes
overseas
to
try
to
bang
heads--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--yes,
it
was
trying--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--the
only
thing
the
agency
authorized
was
grafnet
and
telenet
to
engage
in
international
operations.
now,
the
policies
underlying
that
were
policies
that
the
agency
sought
to
foster.
we
believe
the
history
is
clear
that
any
time
an
agency
is
engaged
in
action
in
furtherance
of
the
business
that
it's
to
be
done
in
the
sunshine.
the
only
things
to
be
excluded
are
casual
conversations
and
the
like.
when
they
went...
as
i
say,
the
fact
that
they
went
overseas
is
unusual,
because
regulatory
agencies
typically
don't
get
involved
trying
to
negotiate
with
foreign
governments.
but
when
they
do
that,
then
it's
agency
business
subject
to
the
act.
we
don't
understand
the
fcc
to
deny
that
if
the
commission
is...
and
i
think
their
brief
is
clear
on
this...
if
they're
doing
what
they
said
they're
doing
in
the
undisputed
statements
of
fact,
that
that
conduct
is
subject,
is
within
the
definition
of
"meeting"...
the
joint
deliberations
involving
the
joint
conduct
or
disposition
of
agency
business.
they
do
reserve
their
point
in
the
reply
brief,
which
i
think
is
what
they're
saying
here,
that
even
if
they
are
involved
in
the
joint
conduct
or
disposition
of
agency
business,
the
sunshine
act
is
not
applicable,
either
on
the
one
hand
because
whatever
they
did
was
unauthorized
or
on
the
other
because
whatever
they
did
they
didn't
do
at
meetings
of
the
fcc
in
washington.
but
we
don't
understand
them
to
deny
that
if
in
fact
they
were
in
a
negotiating
stance,
as
they
admitted,
if
they
were
seeking
a
quid
pro
quo,
that
the
act
would
be
applicable.
we
point
out
that
they
proposed...
when
you
get
away
from
decision,
formal
decision
making
itself,
they've
proposed
a
standard
based
on
bergen
klitzman's
interpretive
guide
to
the
sunshine
act.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
we
fully
accept
that
standard
and
we
believe
that
on
the
undisputed
facts
we
come
within
it.
with
respect
to
the
question,
the
final
question
which
is
put,
their
final
point,
which
is
the
question,
are
these
meetings
of
the
fcc?
the
senate
report
with
respect
to
what
is
a
meeting
makes
it
clear,
and
i
quote
from
page
19:
"the
test
is
what
the
discussion
involves,
not
where
or
how
it
is
conducted.
"
now,
yes,
it's
unusual,
as
we
say,
to
have
the
sunshine
act
applied
overseas,
but
that's
only
because
of
the
wholly
unusual
nature
of
the
conduct.
when
the
agency
is
involved,
as
seems
admitted
virtually
here,
in
the
joint
conduct
of
agency
business,
then
the
fact
that
the
act
is
being
applied
in
some
place
other
than
the
united
states
simply
is
not
relevant.
the
meetings
here
were
called
by
the
fcc,
there's
no
question
of
that.
the
closed
meeting
in
dublin
was
called
by
the
commission.
the
american
carriers
were
excluded
by
the
commission.
again,
the
question
as
to
whether,
justice
stevens,
are
these
meetings
of
the
fcc.
we'd
invite
the
court's
attention
to
joint
appendix
page
171,
our
statement
of
material
facts
not
in
dispute:
"on
february
20-21,
1980,
the
telecommunications
committee
of
the
fcc
and
other
fcc
representatives
again
conducted
a
closed
and
off
the
record
meeting
in
ascot.
"
the
fcc
replied
on
joint
appendix
page
173:
"no
objection".
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
fcc--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--yes,
that
they
conducted
the
meeting--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--the
sunshine
act
is
clear
that
the
fact
that
representatives
even
of
the
public
are
there
does
not
affect
the
question
of
whether
these
are
in
fact
meetings
of
the
commission.
if
joint
conduct
of
business
is
involved,
the
fact
that
others
are
there
still
makes
it
subject
to
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
what
he
is
citing
from,
sir,
is
not
the
definition
either
of
meeting
or
the
definition
of
agency--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--and
we
think
it's
clear
that
if
there
is
a
meeting
as
defined
of
the
agency
as
defined,
that
the
use
of
the
preposition
"of"
and
argument
about
that
does
not
excuse
compliance.
if
it's
an
agency
involved
and
if
there's
a
meeting
involved,
we
think
that's--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--we
would
actually
say
that
there
are
two.
there
are
two
definitions
at
issue
here,
sir.
one
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
"agency";
the
other
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
"meeting".
we
invite
the
court's
attention
to
an
affidavit
submitted
by
the
fcc
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
it's
an
affidavit
that's
entitled
to
very
little
weight.
they
offered
it
to
support
an
application
for
a
stay.
we
asked
to
take
the
deposition
of
the
affiant.
the
fcc
refused
to
produce
the
affiant,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay.
so
but
even
there,
when
he's
explaining
his
expertise...
this
is
joint
appendix
177,
mr.
demerie.
this
is
speaking
now
about
the
closed
meetings.
mr.
demerie
is
assistant
bureau
chief
of
the
commission.
"i
organize
and
coordinate
these
meetings,
and
have
also
overseen
the
commission's
efforts
to
expand
the
consultative
process
dialogue
to
include
discussions
of
non-facilities
communications
issues.
"
we
believe
this
is
a
kind
of
conduct
that
congress
sought
to
expose
to
the
sunshine.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction.
as
you
recognized,
justice
rehnquist,
it's
generally
recognized
that
appeals
from
agency
orders
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
that's
precisely
correct,
sir,
and
therefore
there
are
many
doctrines...
exhaustion
as
articulated
in
myers,
finality,
ripeness...
which
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
premature
interruption
of
an
ongoing
agency
proceeding
is
inappropriate,
assuming
the
plaintiff
is
not
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
now,
we
believe
that
even
those
doctrines
have
a
very
important
exception,
namely
the
litem
v.
kine
exception
for
patently
ultra
vires
conduct
such
as
we
allege
here.
but
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case.
we're
not
waiting
for
some
future
fcc
order
that
will
then
be
appealable.
if
the
fcc
achieves
everything
it
sets
out
to
do,
if
it
persuades
the
french
to
deal
with
graphnet
or
telenet,
to
give
it
the
quid
pro
quo
or
the
tit
for
tat,
then
there's
nothing
more
for
the
commission
to
do.
that
action's
going
to
be
taken
in
europe,
in
france,
and
all
that
will
happen
is
that
graphnet
or
telenet
will
be
authorized
by
the
french
government.
this
is
not
a
case--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--we
believe
we
have
a
right
to
challenge
ultra...
the
standing
issue
is...
they
argued
that--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--it's
the
commission
action.
we
have
a
right
to
challenge
ultra
vires
commission
action.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
that's
i
believe
set
forth
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that's
not
disputed
by
the
commission.
they
didn't
raise
that
argument
here.
the
court
of
appeals
addresses
standing.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
no,
the
commission
is
taking
action.
it's
really
the
question--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--when
it
goes
overseas
and
urges
the
french
government
to
grant
an
operating
agreement
to
our
competitors,
and
when
the
french
government
only
wishes
to
deal
with
a
limited
number
of
american
carriers...
i
think
all
that
is
undisputed...
we
are
threatened
with
immediate
danger
if
the
commission
enters...
if
the
french
government
acts.
our
right
to
standing
was
litigated
by
the
commission
below.
they
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
i
think
establishes
our
standing.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
as
a
competitor
of
the
company
that
they've
authorized,
we
believe
we've
got
standing.
the
commission's
not...
that's
not
dispositive,
i
recognize,
before
this
court.
but
the
residual
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
review
wrongful
administrative
agency
action
is
something
that
i
think
is
generally
recognized.
now,
the
only
question...
and
as
i
say,
the
standing
of
a
competitor
to
complain.
we
will
be
hurt
very
definitely
if
the
french
government
knuckles
under
to
the
commission.
that's
why
we're
in
court.
the
cases
that
say
that
a
competitor
has
standing
to
challenge
ultra
vires
action--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--your
honor,
we've
got
two
complaints.
we're
in
court
because
we
were
excluded
from
the
meeting.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
pardon
me?
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
we
know
what
the
government
set
out
to
do,
because
they've
stated
that.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
that's
correct.
we
do
not
know.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
that's
why
we're...
the
government
in
the
sunshine
act--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--well,
that
will
give
us
perspective
of--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--the
only
way
to
find
out
what
happened
is
in
discovery
in
the
district
court.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
recognized--
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
--we
filed
one,
sir.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
no,
we
have
two
claims
for
relief.
one
is
that
in
the
future
the
meetings
should
be
subject
to
the
sunshine
act.
mr.
grant
s.
lewis
justice
marshall,
that's
not...
i'd
like
to
change
your
mind
about
that,
because
the
sunshine
act
claim
looks
to
the
future
and
wants
to
get
these
meetings
open
for
the
future.
the
first
claim
for
relief,
challenging
ultra
vires
conduct,
is
looking
to
the
past.
we're
seeking
an
adjudication
after
discovery
of
the
commission,
what
they've
done
in
dublin...
that's
the
only
way
for
us
to
find
out...
and
then
such
relief
as
is
appropriate.
thank
you.
