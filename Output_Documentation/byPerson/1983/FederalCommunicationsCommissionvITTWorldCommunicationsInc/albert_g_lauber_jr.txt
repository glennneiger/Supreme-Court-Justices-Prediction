mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arose
out
of
a
multinational
telecommunications
conference
held
in
dublin,
ireland,
in
1979.
that
conference
was
attended
by
representatives
of
six
european
nations,
of
canada,
and
by
three
members
of
our
federal
communications
commission.
respondent
itt
believes
that
the
three
attending
commissioners
had
engaged
at
dublin
in
certain
discussions
that
were
hurtful
to
itt's
financial
interest.
in
particular,
itt
suspected
that
the
three
attending
commissioners
had
tried
to
encourage
their
european
counterparts
to
enter
into
operating
agreements
with
two
american
companies
that
the
fcc
had
recently
authorized
to
compete
with
itt
in
the
atlantic
market.
accordingly,
itt
launched
a
three-pronged
attack
designed
to
prevent
such
discussions
from
happening
again.
first,
it
filed
a
rulemaking
petition
with
the
fcc
challenging
the
authority
of
the
attending
commissioners
to
take
part
in
the
kind
of
discussion
held
in
dublin
and
seeking
the
promulgation
of
rules
to
govern
any
future
multinational
conferences
if
any
were
in
fact
held.
secondly,
itt
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
which
also
challenged
the
authority
of
the
commissioners
to
take
part
in
the
kinds
of
discussions
held
in
dublin
and
which
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
such
asserted
ultra
vires
conduct
in
the
future.
and
third,
in
a
different
count
of
the
district
court
complaint,
itt
contended
that
the
dublin
gathering
and
other
european
gatherings
were
meetings
of
the
fcc
within
the
meaning
of
the
sunshine
act
and
that
those
gatherings
therefore
had
to
be
open
to
the
european
public
and
be
governed
by
all
of
the
other
procedural
requirements
that
the
sunshine
act
imposes.
the
case
as
it
comes
here
presents
two
questions.
the
first
concerns
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
entertain
itt's
charge
that
the
commission
had
engaged
in
ultra
vires
conduct.
the
second
question
concerns
the
proper
construction
of
the
sunshine
act.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it's
been
disbanded,
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
from
seven
to
five,
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
is,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
fcc
has
scheduled
additional
conferences.
there
is
one
meant
to
be
held
in
toronto
next
month,
and
they
plan
to
attend.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
that
may
depend
on
what
the
court
decides,
who
goes.
but
since
the
commission
intends
to
have
future
consultations,
i
think
the
problem
is
likely
to
arise
again.
i
would
like
to
address
the
jurisdictional
question
very
briefly
first.
our
position
here
is
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
itt's
charges
of
ultra
vires
conduct
by
the
commission,
because
itt
had
already
submitted
that
same
ultra
vires
argument
to
the
commission
in
its
petition
for
rulemaking.
the
commission
considered
that
ultra
vires
charge
in
denying
the
petition
for
rulemaking.
that
denial
was
a
final
order
of
the
fcc
and
under
section
402(a)
of
the
communications
act
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
that
final
order
lay
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
itt
claims
both
that
there
is
enough
difference
between
the
two
causes
of
action
to
give
the
district
court
jurisdiction.
we
disagree
with
that
because,
even
if
there
is
some
difference,
they
are
similar
enough
that
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
whitney
national
bank
the
district
court
would
still
lack
jurisdiction.
but
as
a
third
position
we
say
that,
even
if
they
had
failed
to
make
the
ultra
vines
claim
before
the
commission,
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
the
district
court
would
have
been
required
to
stay
its
hand
until
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that's
correct,
that's
absolutely
correct.
we
contend,
therefore,
that
because
the
claim
was
pending
before
the
fcc
the
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
what
was
in
effect
a
collateral
attack
on
the
fcc
decision
and
an
attempt
to
evade
the
statutory
review
procedures
that
congress
has
mandated.
we
think
that
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue
is
required
by
this
court's
decision
in
whitney
national
bank,
a
case
that
itt
has
not
cited
or
discussed
in
either
of
its
briefs
in
this
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
now
turn
to
the
sunshine
act
issue.
the
sunshine
act's
open
meeting
rules
apply
only
to
meetings
of
an
agency,
as
defined
in
the
act.
under
the
act's
definitions,
a
gathering
that
is
attended
by
members
of
an
agency
is
a
meeting
of
the
agency
only
if
four
distinct
elements
are
present--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
am
informed
that
the
way...
these
date
back
to
1974,
and
i
understand
at
the
close
of
every
multinational
session,
as
the
last
item
on
the
agenda,
the
various
foreign
participants
and
the
americans
would
decide
when
to
have
the
next
meeting
and
what
might
usefully
be
discussed
there.
then
the
staff
level
people
would
arrange
the
detailed
agenda,
the
place
to
have
it,
and
so
forth.
so
that
all
the
meetings
were
called
by
consensus,
as
it
were,
and
the
dublin
session
i
think
was
no
exception
to
that
rule.
the
four
requirements
of
a
meeting
of
the
agency
under
the
act
are:
first,
that
the
members
who
attend
must
be
a
quorum
of
the
full
agency
or
a
quorum
of
a
subdivision
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
agency;--
second,
the
attending
members
must
engage
in
deliberations;--
third,
those
deliberations
must
determine
or
result
in
joint
conduct
or
disposition
of
official
agency
business;--
and
finally,
if
those
three
things
are
met,
the
meeting,
if
such
it
is,
must
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
if
any
one
of
these
four
definitional
components
is
absent,
the
sunshine
act
can
have
no
application.
we
contend
that,
with
respect
to
the
multinational
gatherings
involved
here,
all
four
elements
were
missing.
but
today
i'd
like
to
focus
on
just
two
of
the
definitional
components:
the
first
component,
that
is,
a
requirement
of
authorization
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
agency;
and
the
fourth
element,
that
is,
the
requirement
that
the
meeting
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
in
our
view,
upon
a
proper
construction
of
the
sunshine
act
the
district
court
was
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
award
summary
judgment
to
the
fcc
on
either
of
these
two
independently
sufficient
grounds.
first,
then,
as
to
the
authorization
to
act
requirement.
all
parties
here
agree
that
the
members
who
attended
these
european
gatherings
were
not
a
quorum
of
the
full
commission.
at
all
relevant
times,
the
commission
had
seven
members,
so
a
quorum
was
four.
however,
at
no
time
did
more
than
three
members
of
the
commission
attend
the
consultative
process.
however,
those
three
attending
members
were
members
and
a
quorum
of
a
subdivision
of
the
commission,
that
is,
the
telecommunications
committee.
the
question
therefore
is
whether
that
committee,
those
three
attending
members,
were
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
commission
at
the
european
sessions.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
whatever
the
term
"authorization"
means,
and
i
will
now
explain
what
we
think
it
means.
we
think
it
must
be
interpreted
to
involve
some
kind
of
power
to
bind
the
others.
we
think
that
was
absent
here.
now,
in
order
to
define
whether
or
not
the
three
attending
members
were
in
fact
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
entire
body
in
europe,
one
must
turn
to
the
organic
statute
that
created
the
fcc,
the
communications
act.
that
statute,
like
most
such
statutes,
has
a
provision
which
empowers
the
fcc
to
delegate
its
authority,
either
to
panels
of
commissioners,
to
individual
commissioners,
to
boards
of
employees,
or
to
single
employees.
the
communications
act
provides
that
such
a
delegation
of
authority
can
be
made
only
by
published
rule
or
by
order.
it
further
provides
that
such
a
rule
or
order
can
be
adopted,
modified,
or
rescinded
only
by
a
majority
vote
of
the
full
commission.
now,
in
fact
the
fcc
by
rule
has
delegated
a
great
deal
of
authority
to
various
groups
and
individuals
within
the
commission.
those
delegation
orders
occupy
some
20
pages
in
47
cfr
subpart
f.
now,
among
these
many
delegation
orders,
only
one
delegates
authority
to
the
telecommunications
committee
as
it
formerly
was.
that
delegation
order
formerly
authorized
the
committee
to
act
upon
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
filed
by
common
carriers
under
section
214
of
the
act
above
a
certain
dollar
range.
now,
section
214
applications
are
required
to
be
filed
by
common
carriers
before
they
can
acquire
facilities
to
initiate
new
service.
section
214
applications
are
handled
in
a
relatively
formal
proceeding
where
the
applicant
submits
a
brief
in
support
of
his
application,
opponents,
typically
competitors,
file
opposing
briefs,
called
petitions
to
deny,
and
the
applicant
then
submits
a
reply
brief.
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings,
the
committee
or
the
full
commission
will
then
either
grant
or
deny
the
application.
neither
court
below
found
or
even
suggested
that
the
three
attending
commissioners
were
acting
on
section
214
applications
in
europe.
moreover,
those
three
attending
commissioners
of
that
committee
had
received
no
other
delegation
of
authority
from
the
fcc
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
commission
in
europe
or
anywhere
else.
accordingly,
in
our
view
it's
perfectly
plain
that
those
european...
because
the
commissioners
had
not
been
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
fcc,
those
gatherings
were
not
meetings
of
the
fcc
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
three
attending
commissioners
had
received
no
formal
delegation
of
authority
from
the
full
fcc.
rather,
the
d.c.
circuit
hypothesized
that
the
fcc,
in
violation
of
the
communications
act,
had
made
a
sub
rosa
delegation
of
authority,
not
evidenced
by
a
published
rule
or
order,
to
the
three
attending
commissioners.
the
court
below
based
this
hypothesis
entirely
upon
inference,
an
inference
it
drew
from
the
facts
that
the
attending
commissioners
went
to
europe
in
their
official
roles
and
that
they
there
discussed
matters
that
were
important
to
the
fcc.
in
our
view,
this
reasoning
is
just
plain
wrong.
first
of
all,
we
know
of
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
an
agency,
in
the
face
of
an
explicit
delegations
of
powers
provision
in
its
statute,
can
somehow
delegate
authority
in
any
other
way.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
that
there
is
something
in
the
statute
of
the
fcc
which
requires
that
it
normally
meet
in
washington,
d.c.
i'm
not
aware
if
panels
could
conduct
activities
elsewhere.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
unusual,
but
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
is
any
express
provision
mandating
that
they
hold
meetings
in
the
continental
u.s.
but
we
will
try
and
find
out
before
the
reply.
secondly,
the
second
reason
the
unofficial
delegation
theory
will
not
work,
is
that
the
assumption
of
an
illegal
delegation
by
the
court
below
was
wholly
contrary
to
the
presumption
of
regularity
that
normally
is
accorded
administrative
action.
thirdly,
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
we
think
proves
too
much.
it
has
no
limiting
principle.
if
unofficial
delegation
can
be
inferred
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
delegation,
a
meeting
could
be
held
to
be
held
whenever
members
of
an
agency
go
somewhere
in
their
official
roles
and
talk
about
important
business.
it
would
apply
to
seminars,
lectures,
trade
group
meetings,
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
meant,
that
they
were
going
on
government
time;
they
were
being
invited
because
of
who
they
were,
i.e.,
commissioners,
not
tourists
or
the
like;
and
that
they
were
there
because
they
were
commissioners.
the
europeans
wanted
them
there
as
commissioners.
the
whole
process
grew
out
of
misunderstanding
by
the
europeans,
who
are
accustomed
to--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
guess
it
means
to
be
somewhere
and
be
able
to
speak
with
some
authority
about
the
commission's
interests
and
objectives,
what
it
hopes
to
accomplish.
the
court
of
appeals...
we
agreed
below
that
they
were
attending
in
their
official
roles.
no
one
said
what
that
meant.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
because
we
agreed--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--that
the
whole...
it
wasn't
down
there,
but--
[laughter]
because
it
was
clear
that
the
europeans
wanted
the
commissioners
there
because
they
were
commissioners
and
because
they
had
some
kind
of
authority
to
speak
about
what
was
important.
they
weren't
just
commentators
or
lecturers
or
scholars.
they
were
part
of
the
american
government
bureaucracy.
and
the
europeans
in
the
past
have
been
frustrated
because
they
would
cut
a
deal
with
a
carrier
and
the
commission
would
come
in
and
veto
it,
and
they
didn't
like
not
knowing
what
was
going
on.
they
wanted
to
meet
the
commissioners
and
talk
to
them
personally.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
a
fourth
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
theory
we
think
is
that
it
will
make
it
impossible
to
administer
the
sunshine
act
as
congress
intended.
the
act's
rules
operate
generally
prospectively.
that
is,
if
an
agency
plans
to
hold
a
meeting
it
must
announce
the
time
of
the
meeting,
the
place,
agenda,
in
advance
of
the
meeting.
it
must
also
announce
in
advance
whether
or
not
the
meeting
will
be
open
or
closed
to
the
public.
congress
therefore,
we
think,
must
clearly
have
presumed
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
under
the
sunshine
act
it
requires
the
agency
to
vote
by
a
majority
vote
whether
or
not
to
close
the
meeting
under
one
of
the
ten
exceptions
under
the
sunshine
act,
and
they
must
record
those
votes,
publish
who
voted
how
on
the
record
within
a
week,
i
think,
after
the
votes
are
taken.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
they've
never
really
been
forced
to
face
the
issue
until
this
lawsuit
began.
i
assume
it
would
have
to
be
done
by
some
kind
of
consensus.
there
were
people
from
seven
or
eight
european
nations
and
from
the
united
states,
and
if
it
were
simply
a
majority
vote--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--oh,
no,
i'm
sorry.
that's
not
correct.
i
think
the
record
does
show
that
it
was
the
fcc
that
requested
that
the
dublin
session
be
closed
when
discussion
came
around
to
the
issue
of
new
carriers
and
services,
and
that
the
europeans
went
along
with
that.
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
power
to
effect
this.
congress
clearly
presumed
that
an
agency
would
be
able
to
know
ahead
of
time
whether
it
was
going
to
have
a
meeting
or
not,
and
if
the
status
of
a
gathering
as
a
meeting
depends
not
on
an
objective
indicia
of
a
delegation
of
authority
by
statute,
but
on
some
appellate
court's
inference
about
whether
delegation
had
been
illegally
conferred,
the
agency
can
never
know
ahead
of
time
whether
a
gathering
will
be
a
meeting
or
not.
finally,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
theory
would
facilitate
a
great
deal
of
harassment
of
regulatory
bodies
by
those
who
wish
to
frustrate
the
administrative
process.
if
authority
to
act
can
be
inferred
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
delegation
of
power,
people
can
go
around
filing
lawsuits
challenging
almost
any
discussions
members
have
as
putative
meetings
under
the
sunshine
act.
such
litigants
would
typically
demand
the
right
to
have
discovery
as
to
all
items,
all
information
that
might
bear
upon
the
existence
vel
non
of
a
sub
rosa
illegal
delegation.
and
we
think
this
would
convert
the
sunshine
act
into
just
another
weapon
that
litigants
can
use
to
stifle
administrative
action
they
don't
want
to
see
happen.
so
for
all
these
reasons,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
believing
that
authorization
to
act
on
behalf
of
an
agency
can
be
inferred
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
delegation
of
authority
made
pursuant
to
statute.
accordingly,
because
there
was
no
official
delegation
made
here,
summary
judgment
was
dictated
in
favor
of
the
commission.
i
would
like
to
pass
over
the
next
two
components
of
the
definition
and
go
to
the
fourth
one,
that
is,
the
requirement
that
the
meeting
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
one
could
infer
authorization
to
act
here,
the
european
gatherings
would
not
be
covered
by
the
act,
because
even
if
meetings,
they
were
not
meetings
of
the
fcc.
now,
requiring
that
a
meeting
be
an
agency
meeting,
congress
we
think
clearly
intended
that
the
meeting
must
be
run
by
and
under
the
control
of
the
agency
in
question.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it's
the
prepositional
phrase
(b)
of
"agency
meeting".
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
but
i
think
there's
a
section--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
we
do
rely
upon
that,
but
only
on
the
briefs.
i'm
not
going
to
address
that
orally
now.
we
do
rely
upon
the
other
two,
the
deliberations
requirement
and
the
joint
conduct
requirement.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
think
what
i'm
talking
about
is
subsection
552(b)(b).
it
says
at
the
end
there,
the
bottom
of
page
1a
of
the
appendix:
"except
as
provided,
every
portion
of
every
meeting
of
an
agency
shall
be
open
to
public
observation.
"
that's
where
the
public
observation
requirement
comes
in.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
so
that's
our
fourth
test,
that
the
meeting
must
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency,
and
we
think
that
congress
meant
that
that
implied
the
meeting
be
run
by,
under
the
control
of,
the
agency.
otherwise,
clearly
the
agency
could
not
ensure
that
the
act's
various
rules
were
complied
with.
in
fact,
the
statute
uniformly
presupposes
that
the
agency
will
be
in
control
of
the
meeting.
for
example,
it
presumes
that
the
agency
can
set
the
time,
place
and
agenda
of
the
meeting
unilaterally.
the
act
presumes
that
the
agency
can
issue
rules
that
will
govern
the
meeting
and
bind
all
concerned.
and
the
act
assumes
that
the
presiding
officer
of
the
meeting
will
be
a
member
of
the
agency.
here
we
think
the
multinational
gatherings
held
in
europe
were
plainly
not
under
the
control
of
or
run
by
the
members
of
the
fcc
who
attended.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we
would
contend
that,
because
even
then--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
would
not
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
that's
our
position,
because
even
if
they
had
authority
to
take
action,
they
could
not
control
the
meeting
so
as
to
ensure
the
act
was
complied
with.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
but
all
they
could
do
would
be
to
leave.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
and
our
position--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--they
were,
but
they
could
not
force
the
other
attendees
to
let
the
public
come
in
and
see
them
vote.
all
they
could
do
would
be
to
walk
out
of
the
meeting.
and
our
position
is
that--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know
how
that
would...
how
you
could
administer
that
in
the
real
world.
i
guess
it's
possible
in
some
way
to
excise
the--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--right.
the
delegation
argument
is
entirely
separate.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
we're
now
saying
that,
even
if
you
say
it's
a
meeting,
they
have
authority
to
do
something,
still
it
would
not
be
a
meeting
of
the
fcc
that
they
could
control
and
open
up
to
the
public
if
they
didn't
run
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
now,
here
the
meetings,
if
such
they
were,
were
held
on
foreign
soil,
they
were
hosted
by
foreign
governments,
they
were
chaired
by
foreign
officials,
they
were
attended
by
foreign
representatives
of
foreign
governments
who
outnumbered
the
attending
commissioners
and
equaled
them
in
rank.
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
here
that
the
attending
commissioners
were
in
no
position
to
decree
that
the
meetings
be
governed
by
u.s.
law
or
be
open
to
the
public.
and
if
the
europeans
objected
to
having
the
meetings
open
to
the
public
and
governed
by
u.s.
law,
as
well
they
might,
the
commissioners
would
be
forced
to
have
in
effect
a
hobson's
choice:
either
not
to
go
to
the
meeting
or
to
go
and
violate
the
sunshine
act.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
believe,
justice
rehnquist,
they're
all
prospective.
the
act
provides
that
you
cannot
invalidate
something
that
was
done
at
an
improperly
closed
meeting.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
what
the
remedies
are,
in
district
court
you
can
get
an
injunction
enjoining
compliance
with
the
act
in
the
future,
and
you
can
get
release
of
a
transcript
which
would
be
required
to
be
made
of
a
closed
meeting
if
the
act
were
applicable.
and
we
think
that
to
require
the
commissioners
to
either
forego
the
meeting
or
go
and
violate
the
law
was
not
what
congress
would
have
intended
when
it
enacted
the
statute,
because
the
act
was
meant
to
impose
procedural
restraints
on
existing
meetings,
not
to
impose
substantive
restrictions
on
agency
action.
therefore,
again,
even
if
one
were
to
assume
these
were
meetings,
they
were
not
meetings
of
the
agency
because
they
were
not
controlled
by
the
agency,
and
therefore
on
that
separate
ground
summary
judgment
was
dictated
in
favor
of
the
commission.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
have
two
brief
points.
on
the
authorization
to
act
requirement,
itt
would
interpret
the
words
"authorization
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
agency.
"
to
mean
something
like
"allowed
to
be
there".
we're
not
contending
that
the
three
commissioners
were
acting
illegally
or
improperly
in
going
to
europe.
our
contention
is
they
were
not
authorized
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
fcc
in
europe
because
they
had
no
official
delegation
of
authority.
secondly,
apropos
of
justice
marshall's
question,
if
it
were
held
that
the
act
applied
to
these
european
gatherings,
that
would
require
the
fcc
not
only
to
dictate
the
open
or
closed
nature
of
the
meeting,
but
also
to
dictate
the
time,
the
place,
the
agenda,
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
that.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
justice
marshall--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
think
the
way
that
itt
should
have
dealt
with
that
is...
they
presented
their
argument
to
the
fcc
in
a
rulemaking
petition
that
the
commissioners
were
doing
bad
stuff
over
in
dublin.
now,
if
they
had
wanted
to
get
the
fullest
possible
evidentiary
investigation
of
the
ultra
vires
charges,
what
they
should
have
done
was
file
a
motion
for
a
declaratory
ruling
with
the
commission.
that's
an
adjudicatory
proceeding.
there
would
have
been
an
alj
appointed
by
the
commission.
he
could
have
investigated
the
entire
question.
he
could
have
taken
evidence,
heard
witnesses,
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
they
went
into
a
notice
and
comment
proceeding
instead.
that
was
their
fault.
they
had
within
the
fcc
a
mechanism
to
have
a
full
flushing
out
of
what
happened
at
those
european
meetings.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
no
more
one-sided
than
a
contested
radio
broadcast--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
i
wouldn't
agree
with
that,
justice
marshall.
i
mean--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--what
i'm
saying
is,
in
any
kind
of
contested--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--true,
the
opponent
in
the
proceeding
would
be
the
fcc,
not
a
competitor.
but
i
think
they
could
have
hoped
to
get
fair
relief
within
the
commission,
subject
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
