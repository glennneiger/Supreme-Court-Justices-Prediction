unknown
speaker
may
i
raise
a
preliminary
inquiry,
i
understand
now
from
the
reply
brief
that
your
office
filed
that
the
telecommunications
committee
has
now
been
eliminated?
unknown
speaker
and
also,
the
number
of
commissioners
has
been
reduced
from
seven
to
five?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
of
movement
now
on
the
sunshine
act
issue?
unknown
speaker
at
least
three
of
the
commissioners
plan
to
attend?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
the
district
court
would
have
had
no
jurisdiction,
mr.
lauber,
even
had
the
itt
not
submitted
the
matter
to
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
saying
they
have
no
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
mr.
lauber,
at
whose
instigation
was
the
dublin
meeting
closed?
the
american
commissioners?
unknown
speaker
so
as
to
bind
all
seven,
or
a
majority
of
seven,
is
that
what
you
mean?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
authority
to
hold
meetings
outside
of
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states?
is
there
anything,
as
with
courts,
that
fixes
the
place
that
they
must
meet?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
somewhat
unusual,
would
it
not,
for
a
regulatory
agency
to
hold
meetings
to
take
action
in
dublin
or
paris
or
rome?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
what
does
it
mean
when
you
use
the
term
"go
somewhere
in
their
official
role?
"
does
that
mean
they're
getting
paid
for
transportation
and
per
diem?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
it
mean
to
be
somewhere
as
a
commissioner?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
did
you
agree
to
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
didn't
know
what
it
meant?
unknown
speaker
and
cut
a
deal
with
them,
too.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
lauber,
that's
the
question
i
really
wanted
to
get
at.
who
makes
that
determination
as
to
whether
it
will
be
open
or
closed
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
but
in
these
european
meetings,
who
makes
the
determination?
unknown
speaker
at
least
the
record,
then,
does
not
show
that
the
american
representatives
requested
and
obtained
the
closed--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
just
to
ask,
what
statutory
language
do
you
rely
on
for
this
fourth
requirement?
i
don't
see
this
requirement
there
in
so
many
words.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
"take
action
on
behalf
of
the
agency.
"
that's
where
the
"of"
appears.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
relied
on
the
joint
conduct.
you
don't
rely
on
the
joint
conduct
language?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
still...
i
must
confess,
i
have
the
statute
in
front
of
me:
i
don't
know
what
language
you
say
requires
that
it
be
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
i
guess
it
would
be
helpful
to
me
to
be
able
to
know.
we're
talking
about,
i
take
it,
552(b)(a)(2),
the
definition
of
the
term
"meeting"?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
okay,
i
was
lost.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
there
was
no
meeting
that
took
place
if
there
had
been
an
explicit
delegation
to
the
people
who
attended
this
international
meeting
with
authority
to
vote
in
favor
of
a
certain
resolution
in
a
way
that
would
bind,
would
purport
to
bind
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
it
still
wouldn't
be
a
meeting?
unknown
speaker
even
if
that
action
was
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
and
would
bind
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were
just
two
meetings
going
on
at
the
same
time.
they
certainly
were
in
control
of
their
part
of
the
meeting.
they
voted.
unknown
speaker
they
voted
in
accordance
with
their
instructions.
unknown
speaker
they
were
in
complete
charge
of
their
part
of
the
meeting.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn't
it
be
kind
of
like
a
caucus
within
the
meeting?
i
mean,
the
three
of
them
caucusing
among
themselves
to
react
to
whatever
was
going
on
at
the
larger
meeting,
and
it's
a
meeting
within
the
meeting
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
real
world
that
happens
all
the
time
in
big
meetings.
[laughter]
is
it
correct...
may
i
ask
this,
just
as
i
am
sorting
it
out...
that
you
don't
deny
that
it's
a
meeting
for
this
argument?
you're
just
saying
it's
not
a
meeting
that
must
be
open
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
it
be
open
to
the
public
unless
it's
a
meeting
of
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
a
meeting.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
sanctions
for
a
violation
of
the
sunshine
act?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
appear
before
the
supreme
court.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
let
me
go
back
just
a
minute
with
you
if
i
may.
unknown
speaker
the
general
provision
for
review
of
actions
of
the
federal
communications
commission
provides
that
review
lies
with
the
court
of
appeals,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
you
get
into
the
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
distinction
well
established
in
the
cases?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that's
decisionmaking?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
do
you
say
that
is
decisionmaking
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
going
to
at
some
point
tell
us
what
decisions
were
made
in
dublin?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
do
you
think
that
simply
implementing
a
decision
previously
reached
by
an
agency
would
constitute...
would
fall
under
the
sunshine
act,
and
that
the
deliberations
or
the
actions
resulting
in
joint
conduct?
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
situation,
maybe
apart
from
yours,
where
a
decision
has
already
been
made
and
the
agency
just
sends
somebody
out
to
implement
it,
does
that
invoke,
the
implementation
part,
invoke
the
sunshine
act?
unknown
speaker
but
perhaps
not
deliberations.
if
they're
just
sent
out
to
implement
something,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
meets
all
the
requirements
of
the
sunshine
act,
if
that's
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
explain
to
me
just
simply,
what
authority
does
congress
have
over
dublin?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
how
can
the
commission
or
anybody
else
in
the
united
states
make
dublin
do
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
could
the
commission
do
to
make
the
meeting
in
dublin
public?
unknown
speaker
i
agree
fully
with
what
you
say.
but
my
point
is,
i
am
as
certain
as
i
am
sitting
here
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
move
in
a
situation
like
this
in
a
foreign
country.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
mean,
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
when
we're
negotiating
the
arms
agreement,
has
he
got
to
be
public?
unknown
speaker
but
the
use
of
the
word
"business"
troubles
me
a
little
bit,
in
view
of
the
precise
requirements
of
the
statute.
and
to
try
to
bring
you
back
to
the
question
which
still
isn't
answered,
how
does
implementation
of
a
prior
decision
constitute
a
deliberation?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
decision
has
already
been
made
and
they
are
just
implementing
it,
then
does
that
fall
within
the
sunshine
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
are
saying
that
in
this
instance
the
agency
was
trying
to
implement
its
decision--
unknown
speaker
--as
i
understand
your
claim.
unknown
speaker
read
the
full
sentence:
conducted
a
meeting
with
representatives
of
these
european--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
fcc
normally
conduct
meetings
within
the
meaning
of
this
provision
with
representatives
of
other--
unknown
speaker
--it
still
makes
it
subject
to
the
coverage,
but
his
point
is
that
the
requirement
that
it
be
open
doesn't
apply
unless
it's
a
meeting
of
a
agency.
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
not
the
definition.
it's
the
requirement
that
the
meeting
be
open.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
there
are
really
only
three
requirements?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
also
generally
recognized,
isn't
it,
mr.
lewis,
under
cases
like
myers
against
bethlehem
shipbuilding,
that
the
appellate
court
or
any
sort
of
reviewing
court
just
doesn't
step
right
into
the
middle
of
an
agency
proceeding?
you
wait
'til
the
agency's
done
what
it's
going
to
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
that
damnum
absque
inuria
so
far
as
you're
concerned?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
right
do
you
have
to
challenge
ultra
vires,
if
it
isn't
going
to
result
in
any
commission
order
that
would
affect
you?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
can't
just
walk
in
off
the
street
and
say
that
the
commission
is
about
to
do
something
in
the
future
that
might
affect
my
client.
you've
got
to
point
to
an
order
of
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
not
official
action.
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
it's
wrong.
unknown
speaker
are
you
in
court
for
that?
i
thought
you
were
in
court
because
you
weren't
allowed
at
the
meeting?
unknown
speaker
as
you
answered
the
chief
justice's
question,
you
don't
know
what
was
decided.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
what
the
decision
was.
at
least
that's
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
you
tell
the
chief
justice
you
didn't
know
what
the
decisions
were?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
find
out?
unknown
speaker
if
we
say
the
sunshine
act
should
have
been,
that
won't
tell
you
what
the
decisions
are.
unknown
speaker
is
there
some
form
of
action
where
you
can
get
the
decisions?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
have
a
case
before
you
can
get
discovery,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
want
a
case
to
have
an
open
hearing.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
know,
nowadays
you
can
file
conflicting
causes
of
action.
but
this
is
the
biggest
conflict
i've
seen
in
a
long
time.
unknown
speaker
but
the
fact
that
you
won't
tell
them
what
the
decisions
were
does
lend
credit
to
his
position
that
you
shouldn't
have
had
a
closed
meeting.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
on
that?
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
one-sided,
though,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
more
one-sided
than
a
courtroom.
unknown
speaker
well,
which
one-sided
court
are
you
talking
about?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
realize
what
you
said.
