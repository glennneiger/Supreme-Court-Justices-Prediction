mr.
stuart
m
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
time
or
anyone
to
make
or
publish
pictures
that
pose
no
substantial
risk
to
any
legitimate
government
concern.
i
think
the
case
is
reducible
when
i
think
of
it
to
basically
three
words,
three
or
four
words
on
the
one
hand.
that
is,
pictures,
where
i
thought
this
case
was
about
when
we
brought
it,
and
color
plates
and
negatives,
which
is
where
the
government
has
taken
it,
although
today
for
the
first
time
i
get
the
feeling
we
are
going
back
to
the
pictures,
what
the
case
was
originally
about,
because
we
are
now
told
that
people
will
clip
the
edge
of
the
lockheed
cover,
paste
it,
that
thousand
dollar,
that
thousand
figure,
on
a
one
dollar
bill
and
be
able
to
pass
it.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
have
heard
that
that
happens?
mr.
stuart
m
gold
no,
earlier
in
this
case
i
have
never
heard
it
before.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
never
submitted
any
facts.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
we
brought
this
case
because
the
statute
as
written
and
indeed
as
interpreted
by
the
government
prevents
us
from
printing
this
picture
of
george
washington,
and
our
basic
thesis
was
that
there
is
no
danger
in
this
picture
to
the
currency
and
there
is
no
danger
in
the
plate
that
was
used
to
make
this
picture.
the
plate
used
to
make
this
picture
has
all
the
distortions
that
are
on
this.
it
also
prevented
us
from
presenting...
it
didn't
prevent
us,
but
the
government--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--there
is
a
distortion
there
in
the--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--yes,
there
is
distortions
in
the
overlays,
just
as
in
the
lockheed
cover,
which
was
a
thousand
dollar
bill,
you
have
overlays.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
well,
you
probably--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--i
don't
know,
and
i
submit
that
when
you
pass
a
thousand
dollar
bill,
while
perhaps
people
don't
look
very
closely
when
they
get
handed
a
one
dollar
bill,
although--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
significant
danger.
so
this
really
was
a
picture
case
in
the
sense
that
we
brought
it
because
we
think
we
should
be
able
to
make
pictures
just
like
gail
wagner
should
be
able
to
make
his
three-foot
thirty
dollar
bill
with
nixon's
picture
in
it.
that,
too--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--excuse
me?
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes,
sir.
i
apologize.
to
allow
gail
wagner
to
make
her
representation.
when
the
government...
which
raises
another
point.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
that's
a
good
question.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
grover
cleveland.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
well,
if
that
is
part
of
the
government's
claim,
the
one
thing
i
would
know
is
that
if
i
was
handed
a
thousand
dollar
bill
with
washington,
jackson,
hamilton,
franklin,
or
grant
on
it,
i
would
be
very
suspicious.
the
government
also...
another
point
that
was
made
today
was
this
notion
that
we
are
now
gravitating
towards
a
case
that
only
involves
really
color
and
size.
i
just
want
to
remind
the
court
that
as
written
and
as
enforced
before
this
case
was
brought,
the
purpose,
the
purpose
element
was
enforced
against
us.
in
fact--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--and
i
believe
the
government
is
now
also
still
claiming
that
there
would
be
a
publication
limitation,
which
we
might
be
covered
in
in
terms
of
an
exemption,
but
it
raises
several
problems
for
both
gail
wagner
and
people
who
might
want
to
tear
out
the
cover
of
time
magazine
and
place
it
on
their
wall.
does
it
become
contraband
then?
but
putting
that
to
one
side,
addressing
the
color
and
the
size,
which
seem
to
be
the
major
concerns
here,
the
problem
with
the
color
restriction
is
twofold.
one
is,
the
government
says
it
is
trivial,
our
interest
in
printing
in
color
is
trivial.
i
don't
know
why
they
picked
the
word
"trivial"
unless
perhaps
it
is
something
lower
than
what
shad
says,
which
is,
anything
that
puts
even
an
incidental
burden
has
to
be
looked
at
and
examined,
but
again,
putting
that
to
one
side,
as
to
why
they
used
"trivial",
it
is
not
trivial.
there
is,
a,
a
marketing
reason
why
color
is
important
to
us.
we
don't
do
it.
it
is
very
expensive.
we
do
it
because
we
think
we
have
to
in
order
to
get
people
to
buy
our
magazine.
it
is
very
important.
this
picture
in
black
and
white
would
not
be,
i
submit,
as
effective
as
it
is
in
color.
so
it
is
not
a
trivial
interest,
one,
in
terms
of
the
market
power,
that
we
must
print
in
color
to
compete,
and
to
attract
readers
to
our
message,
and
two,
color
has
tremendous
impact.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
excuse
me?
mr.
stuart
m
gold
that
is
true,
but
i
did
not
think
that
unless
the
government
can
demonstrate
in
the
first
instance
that
there
is
a
substantial
interest
as
being
furthered
of
theirs
that
they
have
the
right
to
tell
me,
go
write
and
illustrate
some
other
story,
or
put
your
story
about
the
economy,
but
don't
use
this
symbol.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
but
there
is
no
danger.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
because
congress,
when
they
are
passing
laws
that
restrict
speech,
are
supposed
to
make
an
effort
to
draw
lines
that
are
reasonable.
there
are
reasonable
lines
here.
in
order
to
prevent
what
i
think
the
government
is
really
getting
at...
and
there
is
a
footnote
in
their
brief
about
a
magazine
that
published
a
full
color
actual
size
hundred
dollar
bill.
if
that
is
what
the
danger
is,
and
i
can
conceive
that
there
is
a
danger
of
that,
then
let's
have
the
government
regulate
that,
prevent
that.
you
don't
have
to
prevent
all
color
representations
in
order
to
pass
a
statute
that
will
stop
someone
from
making
a
full
size,
actual
size,
actual
color
representation
of
a
hundred
dollar
bill
or
any
dollar
bill.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
only
had
the
size
limit?
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
have
got
a
couple
of
problems.
the
size...
the
statute
doesn't
let
you
publish
any
part
of
the
bill.
now,
size
may
again
become--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--okay.
i
would
say
that
if
the
statute
were
struck
and
congress
in
its
considered
judgment,
after
fully
vented
the
first
amendment
interest
and
the
government's
interest,
drew
the
line
in
terms
of
just
the
size,
you
cannot
print
in
the
actual
size,
or
if
they
drew
the
line
as
the
treasury
department
submitted,
one
and
a
half
times
as
large
or
less
than
three
quarters,
if
after
their
considered
judgment
that
was
the
statute
that
came
out,
this
would
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
but
if
the
government
were
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
serious
danger
for
bills
that
were
one
and
a
quarter
the
time...
times
the
size
of
the
actual
thing,
and
congress
then
passed
the
line
there,
our
case
would
be
very
weak,
i
submit.
but
here
we
haven't
had
that.
here
we
have
had
a
statute
that...
474,
paragraph
6,
was
not
considered
very
much
when
it
was
passed;
504
was
considered
but
basically
on
the
submission
of
the
treasury
department.
no
one
ever
raised
a
first
amendment
concern.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
legislative
history
that
could
show
that
you
need
to
prevent
these
kinds
of
pictures
or
these
kinds
of
plates,
even,
to
control
what
you
are
trying
to
stop,
the
impact
on
counterfeiting.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
not--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--i
do
not
think
that
that
has
bearing
on
whether
or
not
they
are
passing
statutes
that
in
fact
further
the
interest
against
counterfeiting.
this
statute
doesn't...
its
purpose
is
to
attack
counterfeiting,
but
i
am
not
sure
it
really
addresses
the
problem.
it
really
does
not.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
no,
those
are
not
unconstitutional.
however,
here,
there
has
been
no
weighing.
there
is
a
reason
why
trademarks
are
protected,
just
as
copyrights
are
protected,
and
certainly
protecting
copyrights,
for
instance,
furthers
a
purpose
in
which
there
has
been
a
decision
that
first
amendment
rights
have
to
give
way
somewhat.
we
are
not
saying--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
let
me
amend
that.
i
don't
think
he
could
copyright
any
and
each
part
of
this...
of
the
currency.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
the
whole
thing?
i
am
not
sure
whether...
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
expression
is
original
enough
to
qualify
as
copyright.
however,
if
he
was
able
to
copyright
the
entire
bill,
which
again
i
am
not
sure
he
could,
then
i
think
we
would...
to
a
large
extent
might
qualify
in
using
parts
of
it,
and
we
have
never
used
the
entire
piece
of
currency
as
a
fair
use.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes,
i
think,
as
i
said
before,
that
would
be
a
different
case,
if
those
findings
were
made.
however,
this
case
has
existed
for
quite
some
time
now,
several
years,
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
any
compelling,
compelling
justification
of
the
restrictions
of
this
statute
in
furthering
the
interest
in
preventing
counterfeiting.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
that
there
is
some
element
of
balancing
in
that
once
the
government
demonstrates
that
this
is
advancing
in
some
way
their
interest,
then
maybe
our
first
amendment
rights
to
some
extent
have
to
give
way,
but
there
has
been
no
such
demonstration.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes,
once
you
are
convinced
that
the
government
has
demonstrated
that
this
is
a
danger.
until
then,
i
believe
that
it
is
time
as
well
as
other
people's
right
to
make
their
editorial
judgments,
their
judgments
that
this
picture,
which
is
banned,
and
that
we
wanted
to
publish
to
demonstrate
that
a
corporation
was
cash
rich,
and
while
its
future
was
uncertain,
depending
on
the
decisions
it
made,
the
horizons
were
unlimited,
and
had
to
go
with
a
picture
that
has
coins
on
there
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
cash
rich
company.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
well,
to
demonstrate
a
need
to
do
what
they
want
to
do,
i
don't
believe
they
could.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
to
protect
against
counterfeiting?
yes,
it
does.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
it
does.
and,
your
honor,
if
they
came
in
with
proof
that
demonstrated
that
the
making
of
plates
in
copies
for
use
as
magazine
covers
were
a
problem,
and
then
the
congress
went
on
to
write
a
statute
that
punished
you
for
printing,
publishing,
possessing
a
plate
or
picture
in
an
exact
copy
of
the
currency,
that
probably
would
withstand
the
test.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
did
attempt
the
first--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--no,
it
is
not.
but
i
have
tried
to
think
of
would
we
be
sending
this
back
for
congress
to
go
through
the
motions
and
then
come
back
and
say
there
is
no
way
to
get
at
even
what
the
government
legitimately
wants
to
get
at.
i
think
they
could
if
they
prohibited
the
making,
possessing,
selling
of
a
duplicate
or
exact
copy
of
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
or
any
plate
or
negative
from
which
one
could
be
made.
then
i
thought
there
might
be
a
loophole
there,
that
there
may
be
some
people
who
make
bad
copies,
and
then
will
try
and
do
something
with
them,
so
that
they
could
have
a
statute
that
also
prohibits
the
making,
possessing,
selling,
passing
of
a
likeness
of
any
obligation
and
perhaps
any
part
thereof
with
the
intent
to
defraud.
there,
you
will
get
somebody
who
intends
to
do
something
bad
with
it
but
it
just
didn't
come
close
enough.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
well,
but
the
government,
if
i
understand
them,
does
not
want,
or
one
of
their
big
pitches
to
you
has
been,
we
need...
we
can't
catch
people
when
they
are
in
the
act
of
the
counterfeiting.
we
have
got
to
stop
it
a
step
before.
we
want
to
go
into
the
printing
plant,
and
if
these
plates
are
in
there,
say,
we
now
have
the
right
to
assume
that
these
plates
may
be
used
for
counterfeiting.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
anything
that
comes
within
the
definition
of
an
obligation.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
right.
well,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is,
yes,
they
are
entitled
to
protect
people,
and
one
way
to
protect
that
is,
as
was
just
mentioned,
was
to
go
after
the
person
who
takes
the
copy
of
the...
the
counterfeit
copy
of
the
bond
and
tries
to
pass
it.
the
second
step
would
be,
again,
if
they
demonstrated
that
it
was
useful
to
have
plates
or
pictures
of
parts
of
bonds
that
could
be
used
to
defraud
people,
again,
with
that
kind
of
showing,
perhaps
they
could
sustain
a
statute
that
once
again
would
protect
against
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
it
may
be
that
after
re-examining
the
statute,
congress
would
say
bonds
is
a
different
story
from
currency.
i
am
not
sure
they
would,
but
they
might.
again,
we
are
dealing
here
with
no
demonstration.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
would
think
if
there
were...
if
the
government
came
in,
for
instance,
as
i
said,
and
presented
a
problem
of
plates
existing--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--into
congress.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
well--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--no--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--justice
white,
the
record
in
this
lawsuit,
certainly
in
the
district
court,
there
is
no
evidence
from
the
government.
in
this
court,
they
have
tried
to
make
a
showing
by
telling...
giving
you
various
facts,
like
the
impacto
story.
that
is
why
i
said
that
i
am
highly
dubious
that
the
government,
if
they
had
to
present
justifications
if
the
statute
is
struck
down
and
congress
is
going
to
deal
with
it,
that
they
could
justify
it,
because
we
have
not
heard
it.
i
have
not
seen
anything
in
their
submissions
to
this
court,
forgetting
about
whether
they
are
in
the
record,
but
in
their
briefs
that
lead
me
to
believe
that
paragraph
6
of
474,
with
or
without
its
exceptions,
is
a
necessary
tool
for
the
government.
if
you
read
the
rest
of
the
statute,
the
other
sections
that
they
have
at
their
call
to
deal
with
the
problem,
it
catches
most
things.
indeed,
there
is
in
my
mind,
depending
on
how
you
read
474,
paragraph
2,
you
might
even
catch
the
impacto,
the
full
color,
full
size.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
it
furthers
their
interest
in
the
sense
if
you
are
going
to
accept
that,
if
it
in
any
way
furthers
it,
it
does,
because
certainly
they
are
closing
a
tiny
loophole
that
may
exist,
but
i
don't
believe
in
the
first
amendment
context--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--they
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
plates
at
time
magazine--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--but...
well,
they
would
still
have
to
check
them
if
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
creating
the
plates.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
your
honor,
clearly,
if
ease
of
enforcement
were
the
only
test
here,
and
i
think
this
court
has
stated
in
the
village
schaumburg
case
that
ease
of
enforcement
is
not
enough
to
get
them
over
the
hurdle
before
they
put
our
burden
on
demonstrating
why
we
must
have
the
ability
to
print
these
pictures
and
express
ourselves
in
that
way.
yes,
it
is
easier
to
enforce.
you
can
always
go
after
a
fly
with
a
cannon.
that
is
what
they
have
done
here.
they
have
tried
to...
what
i
think
they
have
done
is,
they
want
to
close
the
loophole
that
does
get
at
the
person
who
is
making
full
representations
of
currency
that
do
present
perhaps
a
danger,
and
doing
that,
they
say
it's
a
lot
easier
if
we
just
prevent
anyone
from
using
the
symbol
except
in
these
certain
ways,
and
when
they
choose
the
ways,
they
do
not
make
any
reasonable
sense
either.
this
is
just
not
a
well
constructed,
well
thought
out
statute.
and
when
i
say
statute,
it
is
a
scheme.
i
include
504
in
it.
the
lines
that
the
congress
drew
with
504
just
don't
make
it.
in
order
to
get
at
full
color
representations,
you
don't
ban
all
color.
if
you
are
really
after
the
actual
color,
you
don't
ban
all
color.
the
same
with
size.
if
you
want
to
prevent
actual
size
representations,
you
don't
prevent
any
part
of
currency
being
represented
in
the
actual
size.
there
is
a
picture
in
our
appendix
of
george
washington
in
a
life
preserver,
just
the
picture
of
george
washington.
that
we
were
told
was
no
good
because
that
part
of
the
bill
that
we
did
show
was
in
exact
size.
i
submit
that
is
not
a
danger.
that
picture
was
not
a
danger
to
the
currency.
and
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
that
would
further
the
true
interests
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
be
interested
in
here,
and
that
is
preventing
people
from
making
things
that
do
present
a
danger,
and
there
is
a
way
to
do
that
without
stopping
time
from
making
its
covers,
or
gail
wagner
from
making
her
picture.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
is,
there
is
currently,
as
the
government
points
out,
there
is
currently
some
legislation
that
is
pending
in
which
certain
publishers
are
trying
to
get
color
removed,
but
to
go
back
to
1958,
i
am
not
sure
why.
however,
i
submit
that
before
that
time,
time
had
not
in
fact,
at
least
from
time's
point
of
view,
time
had
not
used
currency
in
their
covers
or
internal
pictures
in
a
way
that
might
violate...
at
that
time
any
use
that
would
have
violated
the
statute.
currency...
i
am
sorry.
our
first
instance
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
was
in
1965,
when
we
wanted
to
present
the
fowler
cover,
which
is
attached
to
the
schwartz
affidavit.
money
has
become
a
much
more
important
symbol,
in
the
sixties
and
particularly
in
the
seventies.
most
of
our
covers
and
usage
have
been
in
the
seventies.
so
in
1958,
i
am
not
sure,
at
least
from
time's
point
of
view,
that
someone
had
sat
down
and
really
had
the
problem.
it
wasn't
brought
home
until
we
decided
to
make
use
of
the
symbol,
and
then
found
that
the
secret
service
was
at
our
door
with
varying
interpretations,
and
many
interpretations
that
would
stop
us
from
publishing.
indeed,
one
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
the
secret
service
has
interpreted
this
statute
in
its
narrowest
form
whenever
it
could.
it
has
taken
the...
it
has
tried
to
close
whatever
it
could
to
prevent
things
from
being
published,
right
down
to
when
they
at
one
point
insisted
that
the
representation
of
the
dollar...
of
the
currency
had
to
relate
directly
to
your
story.
your
story
had
to
be
about
that
particular
representation
of
currency
to
qualify
under
the
purpose,
and
the
lockheed
cover
as
an
example,
where
we
were
told
that
that
was
one
problem
there.
now,
i
realize
that
after
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
and
in
this
court
the
treasury
department
and
secret
service
have
now
withdrawn
that
interpretation,
but
if
you
consider
the
way
the
current
statute
has
been
interpreted
by
the
enforcement
agency,
that
also
should
raise
some
concern.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
i
would
submit,
and
i
understand
the
teachings
of
cases
like
grayned
that
we
can't
expect
mathematical
certainty,
but
that
case,
i
don't
believe
that
that
person
would
be
asserting
a
first
amendment
right
to
go
31
miles
an
hour.
i
don't
think
we
can
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
what
we
are
weighing
here,
what
we
are
balancing
is
our
first
amendment
rights
and
those
of
others
against
the
government's
assertion
that
it
must
have
this--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--well,
that
is
true,
and
in
that
showing
the
burden,
if
there
had
been
a
showing
that
that
furthered
the
government's
purpose,
in
fact,
and
there
had
been
some
showing,
right
or
wrong,
and
the
infringement
on
the
first
amendment
right
was
the
ability
to...
whether
you
could
go
that
extra
mile,
then
i
would
say
that
is
a
different
case
and
that
probably
would
be
affirmed.
but
that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
yes,
it
was.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
it
sat
there
as
one,
yes.
unfortunately,
as
i
have
said,
it
wasn't
brought
home
to
us
until
we
in
our
editorial
judgment
tried
to
make
something--
mr.
stuart
m
gold
--i
submit
it
has
suffered
when
people
have
tried
to
do
these
things
and
been
told
they
couldn't
or
suffered
the
consequences,
gail
wagner.
there
is
suffering
when
that
gets
confiscated.
there
is
suffering
when
people
who
may
have
known
the
statute
was
on
the
books...
we
don't
know
how
many
covers
perhaps
never
got
thought
of
or
even
attempted,
or
other
representations
like
gail
wagner's
never
were
executed
because
the
statute
was
on
the
books.
we
will
never
know
how
much
of
a
restraint
on
free
speech
it
actually
was.
mr.
stuart
m
gold
thank
you.
that
concludes
my
presentation.
