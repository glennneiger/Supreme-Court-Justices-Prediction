mr.
elliott
schulder
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
statute
that
prohibits
a
publisher
from
printing
an
illustration
of
u.s.
currency
in
color
rather
than
in
black
and
white,
or
in
dimensions
approximating
the
size
of
genuine
currency,
violates
the
first
amendment
protection
of
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
there
are
two
statutes
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
they
must
be
viewed
in
tandem.
the
first
one,
18
usc
474,
paragraph
6,
prohibits
the
printing,
photographing,
or
otherwise
making
or
executing
any
engraving,
photograph,
print,
or
impression
in
the
likeness
of
any
obligation
or
security
of
the
united
states.
the
term
"obligation
or
security
of
the
united
states.
"
is
also
defined
by
statute
in
18
usc
8,
which
we
have
reproduced
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
footnote
2.
the
second
statute
involved
in
this
case
is
18
usc
504.1.
that
statute
creates
an
exception
to
the
ban
in
section
474.
section
504
permits
the
printing
or
publishing
of
illustrations
of
u.
s.
securities
and
obligations
for
philatelic,
numismatic,
educational,
historical,
or
newsworthy
purposes
in
articles,
books,
journals,
newspapers,
or
albums,
provided
that
three
conditions
are
met.
first,
the
illustrations
must
be
in
black
and
white.
second,
the
illustrations
must
be
either
over
or
undersized.
in
other
words,
they
must
be
at
least
one
and
a
half
times
the
size
or
less
than
three-quarters
the
size
of
actual
currency.
and
three,
the
materials,
the
negatives
and
the
plates
used
in
the
making
of
these
illustrations,
must
be
destroyed
after
their
final
use.
this
case
began
when
appellee
time,
incorporated,
brought
suit
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
time
claimed
that
the
statutory
scheme
amounted
to
government
censorship
of
the
press,
and
effected
a
massive
infringement
of
the
first
amendment
rights
of
time's
editors
and
publishers.
the
basis
for
the
lawsuit
was
that
over
approximately
a
ten-year
period
secret
service
agents
had
brought
to
the
attention
of
time's
management
the
fact
that
a
number
of
illustrations
of
currency
in
time's
magazines
violated
the
color
and
size
requirements
of
the
statutory
scheme.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
time
and
held
sections
474,
paragraph
6,
and
504.1
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and
as
applied
to
time.
the
district
court
concluded
that
section
474,
paragraph
6,
was
overbroad
because
it
prohibits
all
reproductions
of
currency
without
regard
to
whether
the
reproduction
has
a
capacity
to
deceive.
turning
to
section
504.1,
the
court
focused
on
the
purpose
and
forum
provisions
of
the
statute,
and
held
that
the
statute
is
an
impermissible
regulation
of
the
manner
of
depicting
currency
because,
first
of
all,
it
is
a
content
based
statute
that
requires
an
inquiry
into
whether
an
illustration
is
undertaken
or
produced
for
one
of
the
purposes
specified
in
the
statute,
and
two,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
nexus
between
the
statutory
goal
of
preventing
counterfeiting
and
the
newsworthiness
or
educational
value
of
an
illustration
or
the
type
of
forum
in
which
the
illustration
appears.
the
court
also
held
section
504
void
for
vagueness,
because
it
concluded
that
it
is
difficult
to
determine
what
is
a
philatelic,
numismatic,
educational,
historical,
or
newsworthy
purpose,
and
what
is
a
journal,
newspaper,
or
album.
the
government's
basic
submission
in
this
case
is
that
the
statutory
scheme
at
issue
here
serves
what
is
a
concededly
compelling
governmental
interest
in
a
manner
that
does
not
impose
a
substantial
burden
on
first
amendment
rights,
and
that
leaves
open
ample
alternative
channels
of
communication.
first
of
all,
the
interest,
government
interest
in
this
case
is
that
of
protecting
against
counterfeiting.
this
is
an
interest
that
has
a
specific
constitutional
authority.
congress
enacted
a
counterfeiting
statute,
the
first
congress
enacted
a
counterfeiting
statute
in
reliance
upon
the
explicit
authority
of
the
constitution
to
coin
money
and
protect
against
counterfeiting.
time
recognizes
in
this
case
that
it
is
essential
to
its
facial
challenge
to
attempt
to
portray
the
case
as
involving
a
substantial
infringement
of
first
amendment
interests,
but
time
has
grossly
overstated
the
impact
of
the
statutory
scheme.
time's
brief
contains
numerous
examples
of
hyperbolic
rhetoric.
for
example,
time
states
that
the
law
purports
to
control
the
editorial
content
of
time's
magazines,
and
that
the
statute
prohibits,
prevents,
or
suppresses
the
use
of
the
symbol
of
money.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
illustrations
begin
on
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
the
ones
actually
at
issue
here
are
13
through--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--23.
mr.
elliott
schulder
the
problem
with
time's
exaggerated
portrayal
of
its
first
amendment
interest
in
this
case
is
that
time's
editors
and
publishers
in
fact
may
use
pictures
of
currency
symbolically.
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
prohibit
such
use.
the
statutes
merely
impose
reasonable
restrictions
on
the
manner
in
which
a
person
may
print
or
photograph
u.s.
currency.
thus,
time's
argument
really
is
that
it
has
a
substantial
first
amendment
in
publishing
pictures
of
currency
in
color,
or
in
a
size
approximating
the
size
of
actual
currency.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
position
trivializes
the
first
amendment.
while
time
may
have
legitimate
reasons
for
printing
color
pictures
of
currency
or
pictures
that
approximate
the
size
of
genuine
currency,
we
submit
that
it
demeans
the
constitution
to
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
first
amendment
interest
to
publish
pictures
of
currency
in
color
rather
than
in
black
and
white.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
would--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--certainly.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
none
of
the
instances
that
are
involved
in
this
case
did
the
secret
service
agents
question
in
any
way
whether
time,
any
of
time's
publications
were
journals,
newspapers,
articles,
or
books,
or
in
any
way
suggested
that
the
use
of
the
pictures
here
was
not
for
a
newsworthy
or
other
purpose
covered
in
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
focusing
on
the
statute
itself,
and
in
order
to
understand
the
statute,
it
is
also
important
to
understand
the
legislative
history
behind
it.
the
statute,
as
you
can
see,
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
opening
brief,
provides
that
certain
pictures
of
currency
are
permitted
for
a
list
of
enumerated
purposes
in
a
list
of
enumerated
forums,
but
not
for
advertising
purposes,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
then
the
statute
sets
out
the
specific
conditions
under
which
these
illustrations
may
be
published
or
printed.
now,
it
is
our...
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
clear
that
what
congress
was
getting
at
here
was,
congress
was
attempting
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
broad
prohibition
on
the
use
of
currency
for
expressive
purposes
that
was
established
in
section
474.
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
over
the
years
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
had
created
administrative
exceptions
to
the
broad
ban
in
474,
and
in
fact
had
permitted
the
use
of
illustrations
of
currency
for
certain
of
these
purposes.
congress
essentially
codified
this
administrative
practice
in
the
statute,
but
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
in
enacting
this
statute
to
require
secret
service
agents
to
pore
over
every
single
publication
that
might
contain
an
illustration
of
currency
in
order
to
determine
whether--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
okay.
we
suggest
that
the
court
look
at
the
statute
and
look
at
the
legislative
history.
both
the
senate
and
house
reports,
which
are
identical
in
their
language--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--we
suggest--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--we
suggest
that
the
court
construe
the
statute
narrowly,
so
that
the
statute
would
permit
the
printing
of
illustrations
of
obligations
or
securities
of
the
united
states
in
publications
so
long
as
those
illustrations
comply
with
the
three
conditions
set
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
purposes
and
forums
that
are
provided
in
the
statute
are
basically
illustrative.
congress
did
not
intend
to
establish
a
narrow
list
of
requirements
that
a
publication
had
to
meet
in
order
to
be
able
to
print
illustrations
of
currency.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
didn't
suggest
that,
your
honor.
we
suggest
that
the
two
statutes
be
read
together.
however,
if
the
court
decides
that
under
our
narrowing
construction
there
still
is
a
problem
with
section
504
in
terms
of
the
lines
that
are
drawn,
i
will
try
to
explain
why
the
lines
that
are
drawn
in
this
statute
are
valid,
but
if
the
court
still
finds
a
problem
with
the
statute,
then
we
submit
that
section
474
should
still
remain
as
a
restriction
on
the
printing
of
u.
s.
currency.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
we
have
proposed
this
narrowing
construction
of
the
statute,
which
we
feel
is
fully
consistent
with
congress's
intent--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--excuse
me?
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
way
we
have
suggested
that
it
be
construed
is
that
these
various
purposes
and
forums
be
looked
at
as
illustrative.
in
other
words,
congress
was
setting
out
groups
of
illustrations
of
the
types
of
forums
and
purposes
that
were
permissible.
the
only
purpose
here
that
is
mentioned
as
being
impermissible
is
advertising
purposes,
but
we
would
submit
that
this
list
of
purposes
and
forums
was
simply
illustrative,
and
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
have
secret
service
agents
decide
in
enforcing
the
statute
whether--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
also
the
requirement
that
the
illustration
be
included
in
a
publication
of
some
sort.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
we
submit
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
an
example
of
reasonable
line
drawing
here.
it
is
very
similar,
we
submit,
to
valid
statutes
that
regulate
the
size
and
placement
of
outdoor
advertising
signs
or
the
decibel
level
of
loudspeakers
or
the
hours
in
which
loudspeakers
can
be
used,
or
the
time
and
place
for
parades.
clearly,
there
is
a
nexus
here
between
the
color
and
size
requirements
and
the
statutory
goal
of
protecting
against
counterfeiting.
congress
specifically
relied
on
the
advice
of
the
department
of
treasury
in
fashioning
these
provisions
of
the
statute
here.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certain
illustrations
failed
to
comply
with
the
size
provisions
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
now,
it
certainly
is
possible
to
think
of
examples
where
the
statute
might
proscribe
protected
conduct,
but
we
submit
that
that
could
probably
be
done
with
almost
any
statute.
our
submission
here
is
that
congress
meant
to
address
what
is
a
real
problem
in
enacting
this
statute.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
the
statute
does
not...
504,
subsection
2,
specifically
excludes
any
prohibition
on
motion
picture
films,
microfilms,
or
slides
that
are
used
for--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
treasury
department
advised
congress
that
motion
pictures
or
tv
use
could
not
be
used
for
counterfeiting
purposes,
but
there
is
a
restriction
in
the
statute
that
all
of
the
materials
that
are
used
to
prepare
motion
pictures
or
these
other
uses
be
destroyed
after
their
use.
now,
the
problem--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
problem--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
now,
let
me
explain
that
the
statute...
there
are
basically
two
problems
that
the
statute
is
directed
at.
one
is
the
finished
product,
and
both
the
color
and
size
limitations
would
go
to
that,
because
a
full
color,
full
size
reproduction
certainly
could
be
passed
as--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--now,
even
in
the
case
of
a
color
reproduction
that
is
overblown
or
blown
up,
the
main
problem
there
is
in
the
process
of
producing
it.
the
four
color
process
of
producing
a
color
print
is--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--color
illustration.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
because
the
process
that
is
used
to
create
that
photograph
is
identical
to
the
process
that
is
used
by
a
vast
majority
of
counterfeiters.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
but
by
limiting
the
use
of...
by
restricting
or
prohibiting
the
making
of
color
photographs,
the
statute
narrows
the
universe
of
publishers
who
are
going
to
have
materials
that
are
capable
of
printing
currency
in
color.
it
will
give
the
secret
service
and
law
enforcement
agencies
a
smaller
universe
of
people
to
have
to
deal
with
in
investigating
and
detecting
counterfeiting.
mr.
elliott
schulder
now--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
elliott
schulder
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no.
that's
not
what
i
was
suggesting
at
all.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
statute
is
narrowing
the
universe
of
people
who
are
going
to
have
possession--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
there
may
be
another
statute
that
prohibits--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--publication
of
foreign
currency.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
is
not
a
question
of
making
a
dent
in
the
process.
it
is
a
question
of
narrowing
the
number
of
publishers,
or
eliminating
the
possibility
that
publishers
will
have
a
legitimate
basis
or
a
legitimate
excuse
for
having
possession
of
negatives,
the
four-color
negatives
of
currency.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
you
would
just
have
to...
no,
the
problem
is
not
with
the
photo
offset--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
photo
offset
process
is
not
the
problem.
it
is
simply--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
problem
is
the
potential
use
of
that
process
to
create
color
negatives
of
currency,
which
is
precisely
the
same
method
that
counterfeiters
use
to
produce
counterfeit
currency.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
the
plate
of
that
particular
photograph
would
not
necessarily
be
of
use
to
a
counterfeiter,
although--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i
would
submit
that
there
is,
there
is,
that
actually
the
final
product
here
on
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix
does
pose
a
possible
counterfeiting
problem,
and
i
would
also
refer
the
court--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
preceding
page
also,
page
17.
the
problem
is
that--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--okay.
but
one
of
the...
one
of
the
most
common
methods
of
counterfeiting
currency
is
to
cut
the
corners
of
a
higher
denomination
bill
and
paste
those
onto
a
lower
denomination
bill.
i
have
seen
examples
where
someone,
counterfeiters
have
taken
one
dollar
bills
and
have
left
the
picture
of
george
washington
and
one
dollar
on
the
currency,
and
simply
pasted
twenties
or
tens
in
the
corners,
and
those
have
been
passed,
believe
it
or
not.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
someone--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--this
would
prevent
someone
from
being
able
to
cut
out
the
number
ten--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
the
problem
isn't
cutting
a
dollar
bill.
the
problem
is
cutting
a
ten
dollar
bill.
mr.
elliott
schulder
but
no
one
is
going
to--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no
one
is
going
to
destroy
a
ten
dollar
bill
in
order
to
pass
counterfeit.
what
they
want--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
they
cut
an
illustration
of
a
bill.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
certainly.
mr.
elliott
schulder
and
i
think
the
example
is
even
more
graphically
illustrated
in
the
one
on
page
17,
where
the
size
is
almost
identical
to
the
size
of
real
currency,
and
you
are
dealing
here
with
a
thousand
dollar
bill,
which
are
rarer...
they
are
not
really
in
circulation,
general
circulation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
if
it
were
in
color.
that's
correct.
that's
because
of
the
problem--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
problem
is...
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
was
to
eliminate
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
multiple
plates
and
negatives
of
currency.
those
are
the
same
negatives
and
plates
that
counterfeiters
use,
and--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
right.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
plate
could
be
different
sizes.
i
mean--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that
may
be.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
by
the
process,
i
mean
the
materials
that
are
used
in
the
process
of
producing
the
final
product.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes.
as
i
think
i
have
made
clear,
it
is
difficult
to
draw
precise
lines
in
this
area.
there
are
situations,
as
i
pointed
out,
where
there
are
clearly
problems
in
permitting
reproduction
of
pictures
of
currency,
and
there
is
a
continuum
between
those
cases,
the
case
of
the
full
color,
full
size
illustration
and
other
cases
that
move
away
from
that.
but
the
alternatives
that
might
be
available,
we
submit,
would
create
problems
of
their
own.
they
would
be
difficult
to
administer.
they
would
leave
broad
discretion
in
the
hands
of
law
enforcement
officers,
and
would
create
the
possibility
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
would
enforce
the
law
on
the
basis
of
the
content
of
the
communication.
we
would
submit,
finally,
that
the
first
amendment
interest
in
publishing
color
rather
than
black
and
white
pictures
of
currency
is
quite
minimal.
the
color
and
size
limitations
of
the
statute
serve
the
concededly
compelling
governmental
interest
in
protecting
against
counterfeiting,
and
that
the
statute
leaves
open
ample
alternative
means
of
communication,
such
as
black
and
white
illustrations
that
comply
with
the
size
requirements.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
make
several
quick
points.
mr.
elliott
schulder
first
of
all,
time
tells
us
that
congress
was
in
effect
foolish
to
think
that
the
statutory
restrictions
in
this
case
would
be
affected,
but
we
submit
that
that
is
really
not
something
that
this
court
should
quickly
second
guess.
for
example,
mr.
gold
said
that
he
would
be
very
suspicious
it
be
were
handed
a
thousand
dollar
bill
with
a
portrait
of
grant
or
franklin
on
it,
but
he
himself
wasn't
sure
whose
portrait
was
on
the
bill,
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
properly
or
could
properly
have
been
concerned
with
people
not
as
astute
as
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
gold
has
also
suggested
several
alternative
ways
that
the
statute
could
be
written,
but
i
believe
that
there
would
be
problems
with
each
of
those.
the
first
suggestion
is
that
congress
could
prohibit
a
duplicate
or
exact
copy
of
a
bill
or
plate
or
negative,
but
what
is
an
exact
copy?
a
publisher
could
produce
a
copy
that
is
only
one
and
a
half
percent
larger
than
the
real
thing,
and
most
people
would
be
fooled,
especially
when
we
are
talking
about
all
of
the
securities
and
obligations
of
the
united
states,
including
bonds,
which
most
people
have
never
seen.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
conceivably
could.
yes.
we
also...
the
other
alternative
would
be
to
insert
an
intent
element,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
main
brief
in
this
case,
an
intent
requirement
would
make
the
statute
meaningless.
time
could
publish
an
exact
duplicate
illustration
of
currency
with
the
perfectly
innocent
intent
of
providing
news
and
exercising
its
first
amendment
rights,
and
yet
people
could
then
take
that
illustration
and
possibly
pass
it.
we
can't
expect
all
publishers
to
be
as
responsible
as
time,
and
so
we
submit
that
congress
clearly
had
these
factors
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
thank
you.
