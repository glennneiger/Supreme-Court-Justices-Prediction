unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--are
these
the
three
illustrations
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
page
37?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ones
actually
at
issue
here
are
the--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
i
guess
there
is
more
involved
here
than
simply
the
size
and
color
limitation,
though.
if
you
look
at
section
504,
you
still
have
the
restrictions
on
the
purpose
of
the
publication,
do
you
not,
to
contend
with?
and
the
government
in
its
brief
has
apparently
conceded
that
at
least
some
aspects
of
that
might
be
invalid,
and
it
is
suggested
we
should
narrow
the
construction
of
the
statute
or
something.
unknown
speaker
i
would
be
very
interested
in
hearing
you
focus
on
that
and
tell
us
exactly,
how
you
would
suggest
the
court
narrow
the
statute
precisely.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
there
is
an
overbreadth
challenge
that
we
have
to
deal
with?
unknown
speaker
so
we
need
to
talk
about
it,
do
we
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
example,
you
agree,
don't
you,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
support
the
requirement
that
it
be
determined
whether
something
is
newsworthy.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
specifically
what
it
is
you
are
suggesting
this
court
do
with
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
are
telling
me
why
we
should
do
something,
or
background,
but
why
don't
you
tell
us
what
it
is
you
think
we
should
do
specifically?
what--
unknown
speaker
--how
should
it
be
interpreted?
what
narrowly?
unknown
speaker
any
kind
of
publication
for
any
purpose.
unknown
speaker
at
one
point
you
suggested
that
we
might
strike
down
that
section
altogether
and
leave
only
474
in
place.
unknown
speaker
aren't
we
always
in
a
sensitive
area
when
you
have
a
statute
authorizing
some
government
official
to
decide
what
is
or
what
is
not
newsworthy?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
narrow
that
construction?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
narrow
the
phrase
in
the
exception,
"newsworthy
purposes,
including
newspapers,
journals,
articles?
"
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
even
if
we
didn't
agree,
even
if
we
said
that
we
couldn't
agree
with
you
based
on
the
legislative
history,
and
certainly
not
the
language
of
the
statute,
that
that
is
what
congress
intended.
since
this
is
a
federal
statute
and
a
federal
court,
we
could
just
get
rid
of
the
overbreadth
and
declare
that
illegal.
we
wouldn't
have
to
make
it
a
statutory
construction
problem.
we
could
say
it
is...
we
just
clip
off
the
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
we
have
done
it
before.
so
whether
it
is
construing
it
narrowly
or
not,
you
would
concede
that
there
is
part
of
the
statute
that
must
be
dispensed
with
somehow.
unknown
speaker
may
i
inquire?
the
three
things
you
want
to
retain
are
the
size
limitation,
the
black
and
white
versus
color,
and
the
destruction
after
use.
as
long
as
those
three
things
are
met,
that
is
all
you
ask
us
to
save?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
in
other
words,
that's
what
the...
illustrative
of
all
publications.
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
be
for
any
kind
of
story,
not
just
about
the
item.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
what
did
the
illustrations
in
the
appendix
failed
to
comply
with
other
than
color?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schulder,
may
i
ask,
does
this...
do
either
of
these
statutes
reach
one
of
these
things
on
a
television
screen?
unknown
speaker
so
what
time
did
here
could
be
done
on
a
television
screen
or
in
a
motion
picture?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
a
journal
or
magazine.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
size
limitation?
just
to
make
sure
that
no
one
would
mistake
it
for
the
actual
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
something
in
color,
if
it
were
large
enough
or
small
enough,
no
one
would
ever
mistake
it
for
the
real
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
large
or
small
it
is.
if
it
is
in
color,
it
violates
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
united
states
submits
that
it
is
dangerous
to
the
currency
to
publish
an
oversized
or
undersized--
unknown
speaker
--photograph
if
it
is
in
color.
unknown
speaker
even
if
anybody
would
know
automatically,
just
at
a
glance,
that
that
is
not
the
real
thing.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
it
is
the
process,
if
it
is
the
process,
what
do
you
care
about
the
results
of
the
process
being
circulated?
it
is
the
process,
and
that
doesn't
go
on
on
the
magazine.
that
goes
on
when
you
print
it
or
photograph
it,
and
you
are
requiring
that
all
this
machinery
or
whatever,
the
plates
or
whatever
you
call
them
are
to
be
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
must
confess,
i
don't
really
follow
that.
i
thought
any
photo
offset
printer,
any
qualified
printer
could
actually
do
this.
you
don't
have
to
be
taking
pictures
of
dollar
bills
in
order
to
have
the
capacity
to
take
pictures
of
dollar
bills,
do
you,
if
you
can
take
pictures
of
other
things
that
have
the
same
general
characteristics.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
suggesting
that
in
order
to
have
the
expertise,
in
order
to
take
pictures
of
money,
you
have
to
actually
take
pictures
of
money.
you
can't
get
the
expertise
by--
unknown
speaker
--your
general
ability
as
a
photo
offsetter.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
really
isn't.
you
don't...
this
law
wouldn't
prevent
time
magazine
from
publishing
a
color
photograph
of
a
pound
note.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
can't
believe,
like
justice
stevens,
that
your
just
prohibiting
photographing,
publishing
photographs
of
currency
in
color
would
make
any
dent
in
the
process,
because
there
would
be
hundreds
of
other
things
that
they
would
be
using
the
same
process--
unknown
speaker
--then
wouldn't
you
have
to
get
rid
of
all
photo
offset
people?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
only
way
you
could
be
sure?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
schulder,
if
i
may,
they
argue
their
best
case
is
the
particular
things
in
the
record,
so
we
perhaps
don't
even
need
hypothetical
examples.
take
this
example
of
the
cover
where
a
man
is
holding
a
bunch
of
bills
in
his
hand,
the
one
on
the...
holding
your
pocketbook.
what
possible
use
could
the
plates
for
that
picture
be
to
a
counterfeiter?
i
mean,
if
you
made
a
million
pictures
of
that,
you
could
never
pass
that.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
government
interest,
legitimate
government
interest
in
preventing
this
particular
picture?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
i
see
it
on
17.
you've
got
a
flat
bill.
i
see
that.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well,
how
would
this
hurt
or
help
that?
unknown
speaker
how
would
this
hurt
or
help
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
instead
of
cutting
out
this,
why
not
cut
a
dollar
bill,
which
is
rather
available?
unknown
speaker
they
are
pretty
available
now.
unknown
speaker
i
even
have
one.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
they
did.
i
thought
you
said
they
cut
one
bill
and
put
the
other
one
on.
unknown
speaker
all
this
does
is,
it
saves
the
counterfeiter
ten
bucks?
unknown
speaker
it
hasn't
run
them
out
of
business.
well,
now,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand.
you
point
is
that
even
on
this
one,
they
could
cut
the
corner
out
of
the
magazine
cover
and
paste
that
corner,
which
would
cost
them
less
than
ten
dollars--
unknown
speaker
--onto
a
one
dollar
bill.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
if
these
had
been
oversized,
or
sufficiently
oversized
or
sufficiently
undersized,
it
still
would
violate
the
law
if
it
were
in
color.
unknown
speaker
that
is
still
not
at
all...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
color--
unknown
speaker
--we
just
couldn't
rely
on
them
to
destroy
them,
i
take
it.
is
that
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
worry?
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
the
process,
it
is
the
fact
that
there
are
plates
and
negatives
that
they
would
be
using.
unknown
speaker
because
if
they
are
taking
a
picture
of
an
actual
bill,
what
would
they
do?
would
they...
would
the
plate
be
the
same
size?
i
would
think
they
would
just
take
a
picture
and
it
would
come
out
either
large
or
small.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
were
sufficiently
large,
no
counterfeiter
could
use
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
still,
then,
i
don't
understand
the--
unknown
speaker
--first
you
say
it
is
the
process,
which
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
now
you
say
it's
the
plate,
the
negative.
unknown
speaker
are
you
using
plate
in
the
sense
that
the
plate
is
the
process,
part
of
the
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
at
some
point
in
reproducing
a
color
photograph
there
is
some
plate
that
is
exactly
the
same...
a
negative
that
is
exactly
the
same
size
as
a--
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
heard
this
before?
unknown
speaker
earlier
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
was
it
just
a
picture
case
to
begin
with--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
a
distortion
there
except
the
size?
unknown
speaker
no,
on
the
george
washington.
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir,
i
was
wondering
which...
when
you
cut
off
the
thousand
dollar
figure
and
paste
it
on
a
one
dollar
bill,
what
do
you
do
with
washington's
picture?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
he
was
talking
about
that.
unknown
speaker
you
can
starve
to
death
when
a
thousand
dollar
bill
is
going
to
give
you
cash.
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
wasn't
wagner
a
woman?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
wagner
a
woman?
unknown
speaker
it
happens
to
be
an
eight
circuit
case.
that's
why
i
know.
while
you
are
stopped
there,
what
picture
appears
on
a
thousand
dollar
bill,
whose
picture?
0
[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
mr.
cleveland,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
perhaps
the
suggestion
is
that
so
few
people,
including
some
present
here,
are
familiar
with
thousand
dollar
bills
that
a
person
could
be
deceived.
is
that
part
of
the
government's
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
were
narrowed,
as
the
government
is
arguing,
so
that
all
that
is
left
is
a
color
and
size
limitation?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
can
put
on
a
thousand
other
covers
in
color
without
putting
this
one
on.
unknown
speaker
i
say,
you
can...
if
you
want
a
colored
cover,
you
can
pick
a
thousand
other
subjects
to
do
with
money
without
printing
a
picture
of
george
washington--
unknown
speaker
--they
say
that
the
interest
that
is
being
furthered
is
the
danger
of
helping
counterfeiters.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
congress
has
said
that,
why
should
you
or
i
try
to
second
guess
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
would
you
have
any
objection
if
the
statute
merely
had
the
size
limit
in
it?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right,
i
gather,
under
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
the
size
applies
to
parts
as
well.
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
still
come
in
and
say,
but
we
really
can't
make
quite
as
dramatic
a
symbol
unless
we
have
an
exact
size
dollar
bill
on
the
cover--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
if
we
held
it
unconstitutional,
congress
had
a
committee
meeting,
and
they
studied
it
at
great
length,
say,
we
have
thought
about
this,
and
we
think
the
statute
we
used
to
have
was
absolutely
necessary,
and
they
wrote
a
lot
of
findings
saying
that
it
is
kind
of
remote,
but
we
think
there
is
a
danger
that
people
might
copy
it
if
we
don't,
so
they
re-enacted
precisely
the
same
statute
after
lots
of
hearings
and
lots
of
legislative
history.
would
it
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
fact
that
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
constitution
permitting
congress
to
enact
legislation
in
this
area
gives
it
more
significance,
the
power
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
they
have
specific
power
in
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
trademark
laws
impact
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
your
client,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
are
they
unconstitutional
because
you
can't
print
something
that
has
a
trademark?
unknown
speaker
could
the
treasury...
could
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
copyright
all
of
his
currency
symbols?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
the
whole
thing.
unknown
speaker
let
me
pursue
one
of
the
other
hypotheticals
given.
suppose
congress
had
made
this
overwhelming,
virtually
conclusive
legislative
history
of
their
belief,
their
collective
belief
that
this
was
imperative,
these
limitations,
to
protect
against
counterfeiting.
would
a
court
then
approaching
this
problem
have
to
weigh
that
value
against
the
value
of
the...
the
values,
the
first
amendment
values,
if
any
are
involved,
in
what
a
publisher
is
trying
to
do,
and
consider
whether
there
are
other
ways
the
publisher
can
accomplish
the
same
thing
without
running
a
foul
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
agree
that
this
is
a
balancing
process,
from
what
you
responded.
unknown
speaker
frequently
we
either
modify
or
strike
down
a
statute
because
we
conclude
or
other
courts
conclude
that
there
are
less
intrusive,
less
difficult
means
of
accomplishing
the
same
objective.
would
we
then
weigh
whether
a
publishing
house
has
other
means
of
accomplishing
their
objective
without
striking
down
an
act
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
how
would
the
government
go
about
demonstrating
what
you
said
it
must
demonstrate?
how
would
it
go
about
it
to
your
satisfaction?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
as
a
starter
that
the
government
does
have
a
compelling
interest
to
protect
its
own
currency?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
have
you
put
your
hand
to
a
draft
of
a
statute
that
you
think
would
meet
your
views?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
your
brief
anywhere?
i
don't
recall
seeing
it.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say,
when
you
use
the
term
"exact
likeness",
that
is
exactly
what
counterfeiters
do.
in
other
words,
no
use
limiting
that.
criminal
law
takes
care
of
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
you
and
your
friend
have
both
focused
on
currency.
these
statutes
deal
with
more
than
currency,
do
they
not,
government
bonds,
for
example?
what
else
besides
currency?
unknown
speaker
any
obligation
of
the
government.
unknown
speaker
now,
there
are
a
great
many,
probably
many
millions
of
people
in
this
country
who
have
never
seen
a
government
bond,
but
if
they
were
confronted
by
something
that
looked
the
way
they
thought
a
government
bond
probably
looks,
there
being
as
many
gullible
people
in
this
country
as
we
constantly
read
about,
frequently
in
time
magazine--
0
[generallaughter.]
--aren't
they
entitled
to
protection,
and
isn't
the
government
entitled
to
protect
those
people,
laying
aside
dollar
bills?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
you
never
have
told
me
how
congress
could
demonstrate
what
you
think
is
necessary.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
where.
in
this
one
suit?
unknown
speaker
oh,
into
congress?
you
don't
demand
that
it
be
done
here
and--
unknown
speaker
--we
put
it
of
record
in
this
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
you
want
it
by
testimony,
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
paragraph
6
furthers
their
interest
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
the
people
at
time
magazine,
if
this
was
the
law
and
if
time
magazine
obeyed
it,
they
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
plates
at
time
magazine.
unknown
speaker
or
any
other
publisher.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
that
is
their
point.
they
want
to
narrow
the
universe
of
where
they
have
to
look,
and
i
can
imagine
what
kind
of
a
problem
they
would
get
in
if
they
wanted
to
get
into
time
magazine
and
check.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
may
i
ask
if
there
is
anything
at
all
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
any
publisher,
time
or
anyone
else,
has
ever
asked
congress
to
make
certain
exceptions
such
as
you
are
asking
us
to
make?
apparently
the
statute
came
about
because
the
treasury
department
decided
that
the
statute
was
broader
than
they
really
needed
and
they
cut
back,
but
has
anybody
on
your
side
of
the
fence
ever
said,
let's
cut
back
on
it?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
hypothetical
that
may
seem
very
far-fetched
to
you.
suppose
someone
is
charged
with
the
traffic
events
of
driving
on
a
particular
street
in
excess
of
the
30-mile-an-hour
limit,
and
then
it
is
tried
on
stipulation,
in
which
it
is
stipulated
that
he
was
going
31
miles
an
hour,
along
with
expert
testimony
of
traffic
people
and
a
lot
of
others
that
31
miles
an
hour
is
no
more
dangerous
than
30
miles
an
hour,
and
therefore
the
statute
is
invalid,
and
the
court
responds,
the
trial
court
responds
that
legislation
cannot
be
perfect.
legislators
are
entitled
to
make
general
propositions.
on
appeal,
do
you
think
that
should
be
affirmed
or
reversed?
unknown
speaker
the
first
amendment
has
been
thought
to
cover
the
right
to
travel,
so
it
wouldn't
take
a
genius
lawyer
to
bring
this
in.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
was
the
substance
of
474
enacted
way
back
in
1864?
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
taking
the
position
that
it
has
been
for
all
those
years
a
substantial
infringement
of
free
speech,
for
119
years?
unknown
speaker
but
free
speech
in
the
united
states
has
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
for
all
of
those
years?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
i
owe
you
an
apology.
gail
wagner's
middle
name
is
edward,
so
it
must
have
been
a
man.

[generallaughter.]
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
congress
could
prohibit
the
manufacture
of
wooden
nickels.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know
why
not.
couldn't
they,
under
your
view?
