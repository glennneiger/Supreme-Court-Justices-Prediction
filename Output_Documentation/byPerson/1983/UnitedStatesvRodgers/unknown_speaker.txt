ms.
etkind,
what
if
the
respondent
in
this
case,
instead
of
reporting
that
his
wife
had
gone
to
phoenix
from
kansas
city,
reported
that
she
had
gone
to
st.
louis.
would
that
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fbi?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
your
answer.
was
it
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
so
the
answer's
no?
unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
i
understand
your
argument
that
there's
no
necessary
inconsistency,
but
what
is
the
government's
position
on
whether
1001
applies
to
judicial
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
ms.
etkind,
the
government
did
not
seek
cert
in
the
friedman
case
of
almost
20
years
ago,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
why?
unknown
speaker
it
was
what?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
a
split
decision?
unknown
speaker
with
a
very
strong
dissent?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
pretty
good
district
judge.
this
was
judge
register,
and
don't
downgrade
him
because
he
was
a
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
may
i
inquire,
then:
you
agree,
i
think,
that
the
fbi
is
a
department
or
an
agency
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
statement
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fbi
that
would
violate
the
act?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you'd
say
if
it's
in
the
jurisdiction
of
some
agency
other
than
the
fbi
the
statement
to
the
fbi
could
violate
the
statute.
but
does
there
always
have
to
be
another
agency
beside
the
fbi?
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
an
agency
that
has
some
jurisdiction,
and
the
fbi
never
has
any
jurisdiction
of
its
own?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
congress
have
thought
it
less
reprehensible
to
give
false
information
to
an
agency
such
as
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
as
opposed
to
say
the
federal
trade
commission?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
didn't
think
about
it
one
way
or
the
other,
then
your
argument
as
to
jurisdiction
really
depends
on
kind
of
just
a
parsing
of
the
word
itself,
without
necessarily
any
relation
to
what
congress
had
in
mind.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moskowitz,
would
your
anti-retroactivity
argument
apply
equally
if
one
of
the
district
judges
in
the
western
district
of
missouri
had...
if
there
were
no
friedman
case
in
the
eighth
circuit,
but
simply
a
ruling
of
similar
effect
by
one
of
the
district
judges
in
the
western
district
of
missouri,
and
then
that
judge
perhaps
later
changes
his
mind,
so
that
it
would
apply
not
just
on
the
court
of
appeals
level,
but
on
the
district
court
level?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
you
have
only
one
federal
district
judge
in
the
western
district
of
missouri,
and
he
declares
the
law
for
the
western
district
of
missouri.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
would
have
93
different
possible
claims
of
retroactivity,
depending
on
which
of
the
federal
judicial
districts
you
acted
in?
unknown
speaker
but
they
certainly
addressed
it
specifically,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
did
he
act
relying
on
that
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
bouie
dealt
with
a
change
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
didn't
it?
here
you
have
no
change
of
heart
on
the
part
of
the
eighth
circuit.
you
simply,
if
you
lose
here,
it
would
be
a
question
of
the
eighth
circuit
being
reversed
by
a
court
that's
always
had
power
to
reverse
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moskowitz,
i
think
you
raise
a
very
interesting
conceptual
problem.
the
heart
of
your
argument
is
that
it
was
not
unlawful
at
the
time
this
act
was
committed.
unknown
speaker
yet
there
was
a
federal
statute
that
prohibited
it,
which
may
or
may
not
say
was
misconstrued
by
the
eighth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
because
that
statute,
if
it
comes
out
that
way,
the
fact
that
the
eighth
circuit
had
misconstrued
a
federal
statute
means
it
was
not
unlawful
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
it
isn't
congress
that
makes
the
law,
it's
the
eighth
circuit,
in
the
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
it
conceded
in
bouie
that
there
was
a
change
in
law
that
took
place
after
the
conduct?
i
think
perhaps
one
could
argue
here
that
the
law
was
always
the
same
here,
it
just
had
been
misconstrued
by
an
intermediate
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
the
state
supreme
court
really
has
lawmaking
authority
that
perhaps
an
intermediate
federal
court
of
appeals
does
not
have.
in
sort
of
a
fundamental
sense,
i
think
there
may
be
a
difference.
