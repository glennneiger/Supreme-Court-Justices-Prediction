mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
petitioners
accurately
stated,
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
statutory
construction,
that
is,
what
meaning
should
we
give
to
the
word
1001.
petitioner
raises
several
objections
to
the
definition
accorded
that
word
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
friedman
and
rodgers
cases.
as
i
understand
her
argument,
she's
saying
that
the
definition
that
friedman
uses
is
overly
technical,
it
undermines
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
it's
not
required
by
the
legislative
history.
i
want
to
discuss
those
objections.
first
with
regard
to
the
over-technicality
of
the
definition
that
friedman
uses.
the
definition
that
petitioner
wishes
this
court
to
adopt
is
an
extremely
broad
one.
i
think
she
defines
it
in
her
brief
as
"power
to
exercise
authority".
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
whether
or
not
the
friedman
definition
is
overly
technical,
i
submit
that
petitioner's
alternative
definition
is
hazy
and
overbroad
and
effectively
takes
away
any
meaning
that
the
word
"jurisdiction"
can
have
in
the
statute.
she
defines
it,
again,
as
"power
to
exercise
authority".
but
the
section
1001
contains
a
materiality
requirement.
many
cases
that
have
discussed
the
statute,
although
not
all,
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
materiality
requirement
inheres
to
the
entire
statute,
and
they
define
materiality
as
any
statement
that
can
have
the
capability
of
influencing
an
agency.
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
situation
where
a
statement
would
be
material...
that
is,
having
the
capacity
to
influence
an
agency...
and
not
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
agency,
as
petitioner
defines
it.
i
think
if
petitioner's
alternative
definition
is
adopted
by
this
court,
it
is
forcing
this
court
to
assume
that
congress
intended
absolutely
nothing
by
the
term
1001.
i
think
this
is
a
result
that
ought
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs,
particularly
in
a
carefully
worded
statute
like
this.
as
to
the
general
criticism
that
the
definition
of
the
court
in
the
eighth
circuit
is
overly
technical,
i
fail
to
understand
that
argument.
the
definition
used
by
the
friedman
court
fits
well
within
a
common,
ordinary
understanding
of
that
word.
now,
admittedly
the
word
"jurisdiction"
is
a
word
of
many
meanings,
many
shades
of
meaning,
but
i
think
a
common
thread
through
much
of
the
definitions
of
that
word
found
in
webster's
and
in
the
case
law
that
have
used
the
word
is
some
concept,
some
notion
that
there
is
a
final
decision
somewhere,
that
the
body
that
has
the
jurisdiction
can
make
some
act
of
finality.
perhaps
not
an
act
of
finality
for
all
times.
certainly
courts
have
jurisdiction,
but
they
can
be
appealed.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
don't
think
friedman
was
talking
about
the
final
act;
i
think
friedman
was
talking
about
some
positive
power
to
make
a
disposition
of
the
case
before
it,
and--
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
--yes,
your
honor,
that
has
been
defined
that
way.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
the
fbi
as
i
understand
it
has
other
duties
other
than
merely
investigating
criminal
conduct.
i
think
they
also
provide
information
to
agencies
regarding
employee
credentials.
that
might
be
a
situation
where
a
statement
given
to
the
fbi
might
fall
under
the
act
because
the
agency
using
that
information
would
have
the
final
say
in
whether
or
not
the
employee
is
hired.
and
that
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
typical
situation
where
the
fbi
investigates
a
criminal
conduct
and
makes
no
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
crime
has
been
committed.
it
merely
presents
the
information.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
agency
that
has
the
power
to
make
the
final
disposition
that
the
friedman
case
was
talking
about.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
that's
correct.
it
seems
to
us
that
petitioner's
definition
requires
an
absurd
result.
it
requires
an
assumption
that
congress
meant
nothing
by
the
word
"jurisdiction".
the
friedman
interpretation
is
a
good,
common
sense
interpretation
of
the
word,
and
the
court
does
not
go
far
afield
to
find
that
definition.
it's
right
there
in
webster's.
it's
a
commonly
understood
meaning
of
the
word,
and
it
has
the
beneficial
side
effect
of
according
the
word
"jurisdiction"
some
meaning.
now,
petitioner
also
argues
that
it
undermines
the
statute,
and
i
guess
within
that
argument
is
the
assumption
that
there
will
be
a
gap
in
the
law,
people
who
do
bad
things
will
not
be
punished,
that
the
purpose
for
which
section
1001
was
passed
will
be
undermined.
and
i
challenge
that
argument.
first,
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
there's
a
gap
in
the
law.
to
be
sure,
there
will
be
a
limited
gap
in
the
law.
but
i
submit,
first
of
all,
that
that
gap
is
a
lot
narrower
than
has
been
suggested.
first,
there
is
another
statute
available
to
investigative
agencies.
5
u.s.c.
section
303
allows
investigative
agencies
conducting
certain
kinds
of
investigations
to
administer
an
oath
to
a
witness.
now,
admittedly
these
investigations
are
confined
to
fraud
or
employee
misconduct.
nevertheless,
that
statute
is
available
and
it
does
bridge
the
gap
somewhat.
secondly,
i
maintain
that
whatever
small
gap
is
left
in
the
law
as
a
result
of
the
friedman
decision
is
a
beneficial
one
and
should
be
preserved.
the
purpose
of
section
1001,
as
this
court
has
noted,
was
to
protect
the
integrity
of
governmental
agencies.
it
is
an
assumption
that
is
not
borne
out
by
closer
examination
to
say
that
the
friedman
rule
necessarily
undermines
agency
duties,
agencies
like
the
fbi
or
the
secret
service.
first
of
all...
and
i
think
the
friedman
court
addressed
this
in
a
round-about
way
when
it
talked
about
the
open
line
of
communication
that
it
is
important
to
promote,
rather
than
to
chill,
that
is,
the
open
line
of
communication
between
citizens
and
the
law
enforcement
agencies.
the
friedman
result
promotes
that
open
line
of
communication.
petitioner's
overbroad
and,
i
submit,
hazy
definition
of
"jurisdiction"
chills
it.
and
i
think
it's
clear
which
result
will
promote,
rather
than
undermine,
agency
functioning
like
the
fbi.
if
it
is
assumed
that
the
fbi's
purpose
is
to
gather
information,
any
rule
that
would
undermine
that
purpose
would
be
in
effect
to
go
against
what
this
court
saw
in
section
1001.
secondly,
an
important
aspect
of
an
investigation
is
that
period
of
time
prior
to
the
final
trial
or
the
final
disposition
when
questions
are
being
asked
of
witnesses,
statements
are
being
taken.
it
is
a
common
experience,
certainly
within
my
experience
as
an
attorney
who
has
had
the
obligation
of
investigating
criminal
allegations
on
behalf
of
my
clients,
to
experience,
particularly
early
on
in
an
investigation,
witnesses
who
are
not
totally
truthful
with
me,
witnesses
who,
because
they
are
emotionally
involved
in
the
case
or
because
they
don't
feel
it's
very
important,
they
don't
see
the
trial
down
the
road,
they
don't
realize
they'll
have
to
testify
under
oath,
are
not
totally
truthful.
it
is
only
later
on,
when
it's
clear
that
testimony
will
have
to
be
given
at
a
jury
trial
and
perjury
is
a
possibility,
that
i
find
witnesses
will
come
forward
and
say,
well,
wait
a
minute,
this
is
what
i
really
meant
to
say.
i
think
petitioner's
rigid
approach
to
this
statute
is
going
to
have
the
effect
of
locking
witnesses'
statements
in
from
the
beginning.
it's
going
to
encourage
them
to
stonewall
it,
it's
going
to
result
in
a
possibility
of
defective
investigation
and
wrong
investigation,
rather
than
to
promote
the
emergence
of
the
truth.
so
i
think
it
is
wrong
to
assume
that
the
friedman
result
is
necessarily
an
undermining
of
the
investigative
functioning
of
the
fbi.
in
fact,
it
may
very
well
be
that
it
promotes
it.
now,
in
the
petitioner's
brief
the
legislative
history
is
also
discussed
as
being
something
that
doesn't
require
the
friedman
result,
and
there
is
some
agreement
here
between
us.
there
is
agreement,
first
of
all,
that
the
legislative
history
on
its
face,
sparse
as
it
is,
does
not
address
itself
to
this
particular
situation.
it
is
clear
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
1934
in
broadening
the
false
statements
statute
was
to
reach,
as
one
senator
said,
all
the
buzzards,
and
i
think
what
the
senator
meant
at
that
point
was,
he
was
talking
about
people
who
were
giving
false
information
to
newly
formed
regulatory
agencies.
if
congress
had
envisioned
the
kind
of
situation,
the
kind
of
scope,
the
kind
of
reach
that
petitioner
attributes
to
this
statute,
then
surely
there
would
have
been
some
discussion
somewhere
about
the
ramifications
of
such
a
broad,
widely
reaching
statute.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
don't
know
that
congress
would
have
thought
it
less
reprehensible.
they
might
and
they
may
in
the
future
feel
that
it
is
as
reprehensible
or
more
reprehensible.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
didn't
think
about
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
well,
i
think
the
lack
of
congressional
awareness
of
the
claimed
scope
of
the
statute
is
not
dispositive
of
the
question,
but
it
is
instructive,
and
i
think
this
court
has
as
recently
as
1982,
in
the
williams
versus
united
states
case
which
i
have
cited,
said
as
much.
and
of
course,
in
that
case,
a
very
similar
case
in
many
ways
in
that
you
were
dealing
with
a
false
statements
statute
and
you
were
asked
to
accept
a
rather
technical
definition
of
the
word
"statement"
and
the
word
"check",
and
this
court
in
so
doing
noted
that
one
of
the
factors
it
considered
was
the
lack
of
congressional
awareness
of
the
scope
of
the
statute.
now,
in
this
case
i
think
the
facts
are
stronger
even
than
that
for
respondent,
because
in
this
case
respondent
is
not
asking
this
court
to
place
an
unusually
technical
or
abstract
definition
on
"jurisdiction".
it's
a
common
sense
one,
it's
an
ordinary
one.
and
it
has
the
benefit
not
only
of
according
some
meaning
to
the
word,
but
it
does
not
undermine
what
congress
obviously
was
primarily
concerned
with
in
passing
the
1934
amendment.
now,
it
may
be
at
some
time
in
the
future
congress
will
consider
it
necessary
to
protect
investigative
agencies
with
some
carefully
worded
statute,
the
way
many
states
have
done.
but
until
that
time,
i
think
it
would
be
improper
to
take
the
statute
we
have
now,
stretch
it
out
of
shape,
and
make
it
apply
to
this
particular
set
of
facts.
the
friedman
rule
has
another
side
effect,
another
side
benefit
that's
a
very
good
one,
and
it
was
discussed
a
little
bit
in
the
briefs,
but
not
in
petitioner's
opening
remarks,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
the
exculpatory
no
situation.
and
that
situation,
of
course,
occurs
most
often
in
an
investigative
kind
of
situation,
where
an
individual
is
being
asked
questions
and
he's
then
asked
by
the
agent,
did
you
do
it.
and
he
says
no,
or
he
says
something
else
in
denial.
in
effect,
he's
pleading
not
guilty
to
the
agent.
does
that
situation
fall
under
section
1001?
well,
that
is
a
question
that
has
been
batted
about
by
federal
courts
for
several
years
now,
and
there's
no
conclusive
answer
to
it.
it's
a
thorny
issue.
the
friedman
result,
however,
has
the
beneficial
effect
of
for
the
most
part
avoiding
that
thorny
issue.
the
friedman
result
then
is
something
that
is
not
only
commonsensical,
makes
sense,
but
it
has
a
side
benefit
of
avoiding
a
thorny
issue.
in
conclusion
with
regard
to
this
first
issue,
the
friedman
result
gives
meaning
to
the
word
"jurisdiction",
where
petitioner's
definition
does
not.
it
does
so
without
going
far
afield
to
find
that
definition.
it
uses
a
reasonable,
common
sense
one.
it
is
consistent
with
and
does
not
undermine
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
the
primary
purpose
for
which
congress
intended
to
pass
the
statute
is
not
frustrated
by
the
friedman
result.
nor
does
the
friedman
result
undermine
in
any
significant
way
the
investigative
functions.
in
fact,
it
may
even
promote
them.
it
preserves
needed
flexibility
in
the
investigative
stages
of
a
criminal
investigation,
so
that
witnesses
aren't
locked
into
their
first
statement.
it
preserves
what
the
lambert
dissent
from
the
fifth
circuit
noted
as
one
of
the
most
important
of
national
policies,
the
open
line
of
communication
between
individual
citizens
and
investigative
agencies.
and,
perhaps
least
important,
it
is
consistent
with
the
rule
of
lenity,
a
rule
that
still
has
some
vitality,
i
take
it.
and
to
the
extent
that
rule
need
be
applied
in
this
case...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
needs
to
be,
because
the
definition
that
the
eighth
circuit
uses
is
not
an
overly
abstract
one
or
an
overly
technical
one.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioner's
overbroad
definition
is
harsher
than
friedman's,
at
least
friedman's
result
is
consistent
with
that
rule
of
lenity.
now,
as
to
the
second
issue
which
has
been
raised,
about
the
retroactivity
issue.
as
i
understand
petitioner's
argument,
there
are
two
basic
objections.
the
second
issue
is
the
due
process
issue
raised
by
respondent.
the
two
objections,
as
i
take
it,
are
that
the
law
is
in
the
eighth
circuit,
when
mr.
rodgers
was
charged
with
this
conduct,
was
not
all
that
clear.
change
was
foreseeable,
number
one.
and
number
two,
that
there
is
no
showing
that
the
defendant
ever
actually
relied
on
the
friedman
case.
i
want
to
address
those
two
objections,
because
i
think
they're
unfounded.
first
with
regard
to
the
law
being
unclear
and
changes
foreseeable.
well,
change
is
always
foreseeable
in
the
law.
the
law
never
is
static
and
never
stands
still.
but
nevertheless,
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
law
was
clear
as
a
bell
when
rodgers
acted.
under
the
friedman
case,
what
rodgers
did
was
not
against
the
law.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
well,
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
of
a
different
situation.
here
we
have
the
highest
court
of
the
circuit
declaring
the
law
for
the
whole
circuit.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
think
as
long
as
friedman
acts
within
the
western
district
of
missouri,
then
i
think
the
result
would
have
to
be
the
same,
yes.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
think
that's
a
theoretical
possibility,
although
in
the
15
years
since
the
friedman
result
has
been
announced
there
have
been
only
two
other
circuit
courts
that
have
addressed
squarely
this
issue.
so
while
i
think
that's
a
theoretical
possibility,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
one
that
is
a
practical
concern.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
yes,
they
did,
your
honor,
absolutely.
the
decision
couldn't
have
been
clearer
than
it
was,
and
i
think
the
way
the
rodgers
case
was
handled
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
just
how
solid
the
friedman
rule
still
is
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
how
clear
it
is.
the
fact
that
other
circuits
may
have
come
to
different
conclusions
about
the
statute
is
fine
for
those
other
circuits,
but
rodgers
lives
on
the
eighth
circuit
and
this
is
the
law
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
this
is
where
he
acted.
now,
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
--this
is
the
issue
i
want
to
reach
next,
your
honor.
it
is,
as
i
understand
it,
petitioner's
position
that
actual
reliance
is
necessary
here,
and
i
think
there's
some
confusion
between
the
due
process
argument
that's
being
made
and
the
willfulness
argument
that
was
addressed
in
the
james
case.
there
is
a
willfulness
requirement
in
this
statute,
but
there
is
no
argument
here
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty
of
this
offense,
if
it
is
an
offense,
because
he
wasn't
willful.
that's
not
the
position
of
the
respondent,
and
therefore
the
james
case
is
not
germane
to
respondent's
argument.
the
case
that
is
germane
to
respondent's
argument
is
the
bouie
case,
and
the
situation
in
the
bouie
case
is
strong
precedent
and
strong
authority
for
respondent's
position.
in
that
case
the
defendants
violated
a
trespass
law.
there
was
no
showing
whatsoever
in
that
case
on
the
record
that
i
can
tell
indicating
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
were
personally
aware
of
a
narrow
reading
of
the
trespass
statute
involved
in
that
case.
in
fact,
there's
every
indication
to
believe
that
they
thought
they
were
being
arrested
for
a
whole
other
crime,
breach
of
peace.
it
was
only
subsequent
to
their
arrest
was
the
trespass
charges
brought.
moreover,
there's
some
indication
that
they
wanted
to
be
arrested,
that
they
wanted
to
break
the
law
to
make
a
point
totally
unrelated
to
retroactivity.
rather
than
relying
on
some
narrowly
worded
statute,
it
seems
that
the
defendants
in
the
bouie
case
were
relying
on
the
fact
that
what
they
were
doing
was
illegal
in
some
way.
and
this
court
stated
in
a
footnote,
i
think
footnote
5,
that
subjective
awareness
of
the
criminal
law
is
not
relevant
to
a
due
process
argument
of
fair
warning.
what
is
relevant
is
the
announcement
of
the
law.
that's
what
must
be
looked
to.
and
what
is
the
announcement
of
the
law
in
this
case?
it
couldn't
be
clearer.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
result
and
the
effect
would
be
precisely
the
same.
a
legal
act,
when
done,
would
be
made
illegal
retroactively,
which
this
court
in
the
bouie
case
found
impossible,
and
i
submit
that
the
same
result
should
be
reached
in
this
case.
certainly
if
the
legislature
had
passed
a
statute
reaching
the
activity
of
rodgers
one
day
after,
there
would
be
no
question
that
that
law
could
not
be
applied
retroactively
to
rodgers.
the
same
result
as
this
court
noted
in
bouie
should
pertain
to
this
particular
case.
if
the
rule
were
otherwise,
if
actual
knowledge
of
the
statute
or
the
law
were
required,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
would
have
a
situation
where
the
due
process
guarantee
would
be
applied
to
those
who
read
their
advance
sheets
and
not
applied
to
those
who
do
not.
to
the
lawyer
or
the
rich
man
who
can
afford
a
lawyer,
he
can
take
advantage
of
his
due
process
rights.
to
the
poor
man,
to
the
blue
collar
worker,
well,
due
process
doesn't
apply
to
him;
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer,
he
doesn't
read
his
advance
sheets.
it's
unrealistic
to
require
the
average
citizen
to
be
aware
of
the
law.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
think
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
not
unlawful
in
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
well,
the
law
is
a
combination
of
the
words
of
congress
as
interpreted
by
the
courts,
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
law,
although
written
in
a
rather
broad
way,
had
been
interpreted
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
a
narrower
way.
and
in
that
sense
this
case
is
very
much
like
bouie,
because
you
had
a
narrow
law
in
bouie,
you've
got
a
narrow
law
here.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
i
think
that
is
a
position
that
can
be
taken,
that
is
a
conceptual
position
that
can
be
taken.
but
i
think
that
still
leaves
us
with
the
problem
of
applying
what
is
essentially
a
legal
act
and
making
it
illegal
after
the
fact,
something
congress
can't
do
and
something
i
submit
that
the
judiciary
can't
do.
mr.
albert
n.
moskowitz
there
is
a
philosophical
aspect
to
this
question,
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
