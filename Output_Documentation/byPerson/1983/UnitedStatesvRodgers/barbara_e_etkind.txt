ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
petition
of
the
united
states
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
like
the
preceding
case,
this
case
too
involves
the
construction
of
18
u.s.c.
1001.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
in
early
june
1982,
respondent
telephoned
the
kansas
city,
missouri,
office
of
the
fbi
and
reported
that
his
wife
had
been
kidnapped.
the
fbi
spent
more
than
100
agent
hours
investigating
the
reported
kidnapping,
only
to
determine
that
respondent's
wife
had
left
him
voluntarily.
on
june
13th,
1982,
respondent
contacted
the
kansas
city
office
of
the
secret
service
and
reported
that
his
estranged
girl
friend,
actually
his
wife,
was
involved
in
a
plot
to
assassinate
the
president.
the
secret
service
spent
more
than
150
hours
investigating
this
report
and
finally
located
respondent's
wife
in
phoenix,
arizona.
she
denied
that
she
had
been
kidnapped,
that
she
had
joined
any
assassination
plot,
or
that
she
had
ever
threatened
the
president
in
any
way.
rather,
she
explained,
she
had
left
the
kansas
city
area
in
order
to
get
away
from
respondent.
respondent
subsequently
confessed
that
he
had
made
these
false
reports
to
the
federal
agencies
in
order
to
induce
them
to
help
locate
his
wife.
as
a
result
of
these
acts,
respondent
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
violating
18
u.s.c.
1001,
which
prohibits
the
knowing
and
willful
making
of
any
false
statement
"in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states.
"
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment,
however,
and
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal,
on
the
strength
of
the
court
of
appeals'
prior
decision
in
friedman
versus
united
states.
in
that
case,
the
eighth
circuit
had
held
that
the
investigatory
jurisdiction
possessed
by
the
fbi
is
not
the
sort
of
jurisdiction
that
congress
contemplated
when
it
used
the
word
1001.
rather,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
congress
used
that
word
in
section
1001
in
the
restrictive
sense
of
the
power
to
make
monetary
awards,
grant
governmental
privileges,
or
promulgate
binding
administrative
and
regulatory
determinations.
as
both
the
second
and
the
fifth
circuits
have
already
recognized,
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
for
the
eighth
circuit's
restrictive
construction
of
this
statute.
this
court
has
noted
on
several
occasions
that
congress
spoke
in
broad
language
in
section
1001,
making
it
a
crime
in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states
to
make
any
false,
fictitious
or
fraudulent
statements
or
representations.
and
the
court
has
specifically
counseled
against
narrowing
this
broad
language
by
construction.
in
particular,
there
is
no
indication
that
the
word
"jurisdiction"
was
intended
to
distinguish
among
the
nature
of
governmental
functions.
in
united
states
against
gilliland,
the
court
explained
that
the
purpose
of
section
1001
is
to
protect
the
authorized
functions
of
governmental
departments
and
agencies.
the
"matter
within
the
jurisdiction"
language
thus
was
intended
only
to
differentiate
between
matters
constituting
the
official
authorized
functions
of
the
department
or
agency
involved,
no
matter
what
the
nature
of
those
functions,
and
matters
outside
the
business
of
that
body.
this
construction
follows
naturally
from
the
fact
that
the
statute
encompasses
any
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states,
without
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
possessed
by
the
department
or
agency.
but
notwithstanding
this
all-inclusive
sweep
of
the
statutory
language,
the
eighth
circuit's
construction
would
virtually
leave
the
fbi
and
the
secret
service
out
of
the
protection
of
the
statute.
the
theoretical
distinction
that
the
eighth
circuit
and
respondent
have
attempted
to
draw
between
action
that
finally
disposes
of
a
problem
and
other
types
of
action
does
not
hold
up.
action
by
regulatory
agencies,
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
concede
is
within
the
reach
of
the
statute,
frequently
does
not
finally
dispose
of
a
problem,
because
such
administrative
action
is
almost
always
subject
to
judicial
review.
by
contrast,
when
the
fbi
and
the
department
of
justice
determine,
on
the
basis
of
an
exercise
of
investigatory
jurisdiction,
that
criminal
prosecution
is
not
warranted,
that
determination
is
not
reviewable.
indeed,
even
the
narrowest
definition
of
jurisdiction
includes
the
power
of
the
courts
to
decide
the
cases
pending
before
them.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
he
reported
that
she
had
been
kidnapped?
you
mean
that
she'd
just
been
kidnapped
within
the
state?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
i
think
probably
not.
i
don't
think
that
the
jurisdiction
would
extend
to
that.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
fbi's
jurisdiction
would
not
extend
to
an
intrastate
kidnapping?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
right.
respondent
makes
several
arguments
that
it
contends
bear
on
legislative
intent,
but
in
fact
these
are
nothing
more
than
policy
considerations
that
are
more
properly
addressed
to
congress
than
to
this
court.
for
example,
respondent
contends
that
section
1001
must
not
apply
to
false
statements
made
to
law
enforcement
officers
because
such
conduct
is
less
blameworthy
than
committing
perjury
in
open
court,
for
which
a
less
severe
penalty
originally
was
prescribed.
but
it
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
congress
did
not
intend
statements
made
to
law
enforcement
officers
to
be
covered
by
section
1001,
on
the
assumption
that
they
are
less
serious
than
perjury
committed
before
a
court
of
law,
when
it
is
common
ground
that
congress
did
intend
section
1001
to
apply
to
false
statements
made
to
regulatory
agencies,
which
frequently
may
be
less
serious
than
perjury.
but
indeed,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
have
severely
understated
the
seriousness
of
making
false
statements
to
law
enforcement
officers.
not
only
may
such
statements
divert
finite
governmental
resources
from
bona
fide
investigations,
but
they
bring
to
bear
on
the
innocent
subject
of
the
false
statement
the
full
brunt
of
the
government's
investigative
and
prosecutorial
capabilities.
the
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
worry
that
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case
would
mean
that
false
statements
made
in
the
context
of
judicial
proceedings
also
would
be
punishable
under
section
1001.
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
from
the
fact
that
section
1001
applies
to
false
crime
reports
that
it
also
applies
to
false
statements
made
in
the
context
of
judicial
proceeding.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
intrinsic
reason
why
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
to
prosecute
false
statements
under
either
section
1001
or
the
perjury
statute.
the
government
frequently
is
permitted
a
choice
of
statutes
under
which
it
may
proceed,
and
the
consequences
of
such
a
choice
to
a
defendant
in
this
context
will
not
be
of
great
consequence.
that
is
because
18
u.s.c.
1623,
which
was
enacted
in
1970,
makes
perjury
committed
before
a
court
of
law
or
a
grand
jury
punishable
to
the
same
extent
as
are
false
statements
under
section
1001
and
eliminates
the
requirement
that
perjury
be
proved
by
two
witnesses.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
i
think,
i
think
that
it
probably
would.
this
court
held
in
bramblett
that
1001
applies
to
the
legislative
and
judicial,
as
well
as
to
the
executive
branch
of
government.
respondents'
and
the
court
of
appeals'
final
policy
argument
is
that
the
construction
we
urge
will
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
citizenry's
willingness
to
report
suspected
criminal
activity
to
law
enforcement
authorities.
but
the
terms
of
the
statute
themselves
preclude
any
undue
chilling
effect,
since
only
false
statements
that
are
willfully
and
knowingly
made
are
punishable.
there
is
therefore
no
liability
simply
because
information
reported
in
good
faith
turns
out
to
be
false.
finally,
in
the
alternative,
respondent
argues
that
even
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
construction
of
the
statute,
that
decision
should
not
be
applied
in
his
case
because
at
the
time
he
made
the
false
reports
his
conduct
was
not
criminal
under
the
law
prevailing
in
the
eighth
circuit,
that
is,
under
the
friedman
decision.
but
there's
no
due
process
obstacles
to
applying
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
government
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
because
section
1001
contains
a
willfullness
requirement
there's
no
danger
that
respondent
would
be
convicted
in
the
absence
of
proof
that
he
knew
that
the
acts
he
committed
were
wrongful.
accordingly,
the
question
whether
the
existence
of
the
friedman
precedent
in
the
eighth
circuit
precludes
respondent's
conviction
is
one
for
the
finder
of
fact
in
the
determination
of
willfulness
in
the
first
instance.
but
respondent
also
appears
to
be
making
a
larger
argument
based
on
notions
of
due
process
vagueness
and
notice,
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
precedent
in
his
circuit
holding
section
1001
inapplicable
to
conduct
analogous
to
his
precludes
his
conviction
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
respondent's
argument
would
convert
every
arguable
question
of
statutory
construction
into
a
constitutional
vagueness
issue.
respondent
has
never
argued
that
the
words
of
section
1001
themselves
are
so
vague
as
to
fail
to
give
notice
of
the
prohibited
conduct,
as
in
connelly
versus
general
construction
company.
nor
is
this
a
case
like
bouie
versus
city
of
columbia,
on
which
respondent
does
rely,
because
there
the
statute
on
its
face
gave
no
indication
that
it
covered
the
defendant's
conduct,
nor
had
it
ever
been
construed
as
covering
such
conduct.
by
contrast,
respondent's
retroactivity
argument
assumes
a
ruling
for
the
government
on
the
substantive
issue,
and
that
ruling
would
be
based
on
the
fact
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
cover
his
conduct.
respondent
is
thus
reduced
to
arguing
that
whenever
courts
differ
over
the
meaning
of
a
statute
the
legislation
is
as
a
matter
of
law
unconstitutionally
vague.
but
that
cannot
be.
if
it
were,
the
government
would
never
be
able
to
seek
this
court's
review
of
an
issue
of
statutory
construction
on
which
the
courts
of
appeals
were
divided,
because
we
would
be
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion.
and
likewise,
this
court
would
be
precluded
from
affirming
a
conviction
in
the
face
of
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
concerning
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
yet
the
court
does
so
regularly.
vagueness
must
rest
on
something
more
than
a
difference
of
opinion
among
courts
and
judges,
and
respondent
has
alleged
nothing
more
and
there
is
nothing
more
in
this
case.
finally,
application
of
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
government
to
respondent
here
is
consistent
with
the
opinion
rendered
in
james
versus
united
states.
in
james,
this
court
held
that
embezzled
funds
are
taxable
income
of
the
embezzler,
thus
overruling
the
prior
decision
in
wilcox
versus
united
states.
james'
conviction
for
willful
evasion
of
taxes
nevertheless
was
reversed
because
three
justices
believed
that
the
new
construction
should
not
be
applied
to
him,
while
three
other
justices
would
not
have
overruled
wilcox.
but,
significantly,
a
total
of
five
justices
were
of
the
view
that
if
a
new
rule
were
to
be
adopted
it
should
be
applied
to
james,
at
least
absent
a
showing
of
bona
fide
reliance
by
him
on
the
prior
construction.
indeed,
even
the
view
of
the
plurality
in
james
is
distinguishable
from
the
present
case,
since
james
involved
the
overruling
of
a
prior
decision
of
this
court.
the
willfullness
requirement
of
section
1001
assures
that
respondent
will
not
be
convicted
on
the
basis
of
conduct
that
he
did
not
know
was
wrongful.
at
least
in
the
conduct
of
this
case,
due
process
requires
no
more.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
reinstatement
of
the
indictment
and
trial.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
we
did
not.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
not
sure
why.
of
course,
that
was
the
first
case
to
raise
the
issue.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that
was
the
first
case
that--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--yes,
it
was.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
by
a
district
court
judge.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
circuits
then,
and
of
course
we
frequently
don't...
we
don't
see
the
court's
review
of
every
decision
that
we
believe
is
incorrect,
of
course,
in
the
absence
of
a
conflict.
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i
just
have
one
point.
i
would
just
like
to
address
respondent's
point
that
our
construction
of
the
statute
reads
the
word
"jurisdiction"
out
of
the
statute
because
of
the
materiality
requirement.
i
would
just
point
out
that
the
statute
itself
includes
a
materiality
requirement
only
as
to
the
first
clause,
the
falsification
or
covering
up
clause,
not
as
to
the
clause
that
pertains
here,
making
any
false
or
fictitious
or
fraudulent
statements
or
misrepresentations.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
courts
have
imputed
a
materiality
requirement
to
all
of
the
clauses
of
the
statute,
but
i
would
suggest
that
probably
is
because
of
the
requirement
of
"in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction.
"
i
believe
that
i
addressed,
i
anticipated
the
retroactivity
arguments,
but
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
them.
thank
you.
