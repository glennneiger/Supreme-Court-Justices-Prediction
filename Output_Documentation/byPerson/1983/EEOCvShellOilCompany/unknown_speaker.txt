unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
you
say
that
one
of
the
issues
here
is
whether
there
must
be
a
trial.
even
in
the
days
before
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
adopted
and
complaints
were
held
to
a
fairly
strict
standard
of
pleading
facts,
i
don't
think
there
ever
were
trials
with
witnesses
called.
unknown
speaker
was
he
alone
in
the
dissent?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
i
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
relied
on
a
particular
provision
of
the
civil
rights
act,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
that
last
language
that
you
mention
now
that
the
eighth
circuit
relied
on,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
definition
of
the
terms,
date,
place,
and
circumstances
that
congress
put
in
the
act.
unknown
speaker
they
defined
"fair
notice"
as
including
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
complied
with
the
circumstances
requirement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins.
unknown
speaker
why
would
the
government
not
want
to
provide,
in
these
pattern
and
practice
cases,
the
real
circumstances
that
the
government
is
relying,
the
statistical
information
that
they
looked
at.
what
is
the
matter
with
furnishing
that,
to
give
the
respondent
an
actual
look
at
what
it
is
that
prompted
the
filing;
i
just
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
what
the
government
in
these
cases
is
doing
is
putting
together
a
few
simple
statistics
covering
given
years,
and
saying
these
are
the
total
number
of
employees
in
this
category,
and
in
that
community
there
are
so
many
blacks,
and
so
many
women,
and
these
are
the
actual
figures
that
the
company
has.
why
can't
you
include
that,
and
why
shouldn't
you
that
in
the
notice
of
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
the
court
doesn't
have
to
buy
that,
obviously,
as
a
requirement
and
the
court
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
turn
this
into
a
mini-trial.
but
it
is
just...
i
just
have
difficulty
understanding
why
the
government
can't
disclose
in
the
notice
of
the
charge
what
it
really
is
basing
this
on.
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
we
have
the
job
of
trying
to
figure
out
why
congress
included
this
specific
language,
and
they
had
something
in
mind
and
we
have
to
determine
what
that
something
is.
it
is
just
hard
to
know
why
the
government
in
these
cases
wouldn't
want--
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
suppose
the
notice
of
charge
just
said,
"the
commission
believes
that
shell
has
conducted
discriminatory
employment
practices
in
its
united
states
operations
since
1965.
"
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
your
answers
assume
that
this
is
kind
of
a
judicially
fashioned
doctrine.
professor
moore
has
said
pleading
of
facts
is
illusory
and,
therefore,
why
shouldn't
the
court
strive
to
make
that
rule
a
common
sense
one.
but
it
is
not
a
court
rule
at
all,
congress
has
said
"circumstances".
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
don't
say
"circumstances".
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
those
were
sound
decisions,
if
cogress
said
"facts",
and
the
courts
said
"no
facts".
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
rationalize
those?
you
say
that
congress
had
said
that
facts
must
be
specified,
and
the
courts
said,
no,
you
don't
have
to
specify
facts,
and
you
say
that
those
are
sound
decisions.
how
would
you
explain
that?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
congress
should
have
provided
the
same
provisions
as
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
so
we'll
assume
that
it
did.
that
sounds
like
about
the
reasoning
of
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins.
unknown
speaker
your
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
charge
adequately
puts
shell
company,
in
this
case,
on
fair
notice
as
to
what
is
being
charged
against
it.
i
have
the
appendix
open
at
page
66,
that
is
the
commencement
of
the
first
request
for
information.
unknown
speaker
is
that
filed
the
same
day
the
charge
is
filed?
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest
to
you
that
the
eeoc
either
doesn't
know
the
facts,
the
basic
facts
and
circumstances,
or
does
it
suggest
that
it
has
them
and
is
unwilling
to
disclose
them?
unknown
speaker
is
that
first
request
for
information
a
standard
form?
unknown
speaker
it
goes
on
for
16
pages,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
counsel
for
the
company
and
received
this,
what
would
your
reaction
be?
unknown
speaker
little
while...
how
many
weeks?
unknown
speaker
how
many
people
would
be
required
in
a
major
corporation
to
help
you
gather
all
of
this
information
which
really
undresses
the
corporation
for
years.
perhaps
that
is
your
purpose,
but
that
is
not
the
way
government
normally
operates.
unknown
speaker
they
aren't
very
helpful
once
in
there.
unknown
speaker
i'll
come
back
to
my
initial
question.
if,
indeed,
the
eeoc
had
enough
information
to
make
a
charge,
why
was
it
necessary
to
file
16
pages
of
questions
that
asked
every
conceivable
piece
of
information
about
the
employment
practices
of
this
corporation
over
a
period
of
years?
unknown
speaker
they
make
a
charge
without
knowing
the
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
congress
chose
this
very
curious
language,
if
it
really
understood
that
the
agency
was
going
to
file
this
sort
of
fishing
expedition;
don't
you
think
so?
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
the
language
were
more
specific,
perhaps.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you...
why
not
furnish
some
of
those
facts
that
you
have
looked
at?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
qualifies
as
the
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
have
facts...
you
did
have
more
facts
than
just
an
assertion
that
they
had
discriminated
in
these
respects.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
you
think
that
some
summary
of
those
facts
shouldn't
have
been
furnished?
unknown
speaker
judicially,
the
question
is
whether
congress
anticipated
it--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
word
"circumstances".
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
language?
how
about
the
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
blame
you.
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
in
a
much
better
position
if
the
provision
that
is
at
issue
here
had
been
included.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
the
commissioner,
in
prescribing
requirements
which
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
can
say,
we
are
not
going
to
require
circumstances
the
way
the
other
section
does?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
the
statute
provides
that
a
charge
shall
be
in
such
form
as
the
commission
may
provide.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
commission
could
provide
saying
that
the
form
of
charge
shall
be
the
following,
but
it
need
not
include
either
date,
place,
or
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
notice
of
the
charge
would
have
to
be
more
specific,
then?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
wilkins,
also,
didn't
the
'64
act
require
the
commissioner's
charge
to
be
based
on
reasonable
cause?
unknown
speaker
in
'72,
in
those
amendments,
that
requirement
was
dropped--
unknown
speaker
--but
congress
tightened
up
in
another
way.
it
said,
okay,
you
don't
have
to
show
reasonable
cause,
but
we
do
want
you
to
put
it
under
oath,
and
set
forth
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
it
just
looks
on
the
surface
like
they
wanted
to
tighten
up
the
requirements
of
what
you
disclose
as
the
basis
for
the
charge,
even
though
they
dropped
the
reasonable
cause
requirement.
so
i
am
not
sure
that
the
legislative
history
argument
is
helping
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilkins,
may
i
ask
you
a
rather
fundamental
question
on
another
point
which
your
argument
has
brought
up.
in
part
3
of
you
brief...
up
to
now,
you
have
basically
been
arguing
the
meaning
of
section
706(b)
of
the
statute.
in
part
3
of
your
brief,
you
refer
to
the
socal
case.
you
argue,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
the
issue
should
not
be
reviewable
at
all
until
after
the
proceeding
comes
to
an
end.
you
are
relying,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
am
wondering
whether,
with
reference
to
the
socal
case,
you're
contending
that
this
is
not
agency
action
at
all,
it
is
interlocutory
agency
action
or
that
it
is
agency
action
under
the
limited
discretion
of
the
agency?
which
of
those
three
positions?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
understand
exactly
what
your
position
is
based
on
socal.
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
always...
can
it
be
challenged
in
an
independent
proceeding
in
federal
court
or
only
in
the
proceeding
itself?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
in
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding,
they
have
no
right
to
test
the
sufficiency
of
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
you
should
have
won
on
motion
to
dismiss
without
even
looking
at
the
language
of
the
charge,
is
what
i
am
asking?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
whether
that
is
so
or
not,
i
understand
counsel
to
say
that
any
requirement
like
that
is
satisfied
by
the
notice
that
was
given
in
this
case,
and
he
says
that
saying
there
was
discrimination
in
these
particular
categories
is
enough
of
a
notice
of
the
"circumstances".
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
they
should
have
furnished
to
you?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
so
i
am
asking
you
what
facts
do
you
think
they
should
have
given
you?
unknown
speaker
what
specifically
would
have
satisfied
you
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
because
it
is
a
practice,
the
charge
necessarily
is
a
statistical
charge;
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
in
addition
to
actually
furnishing
you
notice,
giving
circumstances
some
meaning,
would
also
assure
that
the
commissioner
actually
had
facts
on
which
to
base
a
charge.
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
suppose
the
charge
says
that
you
have
316
people
assigned
to
the
broom
section
of
your
plant,
and
not
a
single
woman
is
there.
would
you
know
what
they
were
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
all
right.
unknown
speaker
what
would
this
one
say?
this
charge
says
that
there
were
no
women
in
one
area,
and
no
negroes
in
another
area.
unknown
speaker
because
there
were
none
in
these
particular
sections.
unknown
speaker
didn't
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
know
what
they
were
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
didn't
you
know
what
they
were
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
i
am
asking
you.
you
didn't
know
what
they
were
talking...
you
didn't
know
what
they
were
talking
about;
is
that
your
position
or
not?
unknown
speaker
who
had
the
facts,
the
agency
or
you...
your
client?
unknown
speaker
who
had
it
the
first?
unknown
speaker
mr.
williams,
what
if
the
eeoc
in
a
pattern
of
practice
case
did
give
you
information
that
it
was
basing
their
charge
on
statistical
compilations
it
had
made,
let's
say,
the
years
'78
and
'79,
which
reflected
an
insufficient
number
of
women
and
blacks
being
hired
in
certain
categories,
so
you
got
presumably
what
you're
asserting
you
should
have
had.
then,
let's
suppose
they
issue
subpoenas
asking
for
information
relating
to
the
year
'77
as
well
as
'78
and
'79,
because
they
want
to
dig
into
the
real
facts,
maybe
they'd
like
to
amend
the
charge
later,
maybe
they
think
that
what
was
done
before
is
relevant
somehow
to
'78
and
79.
would
it
be
your
position
that
you
could
challenge
them
on
a
subpoena
request
for
prior
years
because
it
didn't
relate
to
those
years--
unknown
speaker
--specified
in
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
the
subpoena
could
request
any
relevant
information
for
prior
or
subsequent
time-frames?
unknown
speaker
you
really
would
have
to,
under
that
oklahoma
press
case,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
the
concern,
obviously,
would
be
that
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
you
don't
want
to
put
the
eeoc
in
the
position
of
having
to
have
a
mini-trial
every
time
they
issue
a
subpoena.
unknown
speaker
do
you
contend
that
a
respondent
in
a
proceeding
like
this,
such
as
shell,
has
any
right
to
challenge
the
facts
produced
by
the
commission
and
saying
those
facts
aren't
correct;
in
other
words,
we
have
other
facts,
so
let's
find
out
whose
version
of
the
facts
is
correct
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about
the
procedure.
unknown
speaker
do
you
still
maintain...
do
you
maintain
that
you
could
have
raised
these
issues
in
an
independent
judicial
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
position
that
in
a
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding,
you
contest
the
sufficiency
of
the
charge.
unknown
speaker
any
defect
in
the
charge
at
all
can
be
raised.
unknown
speaker
are
there
precedents
for
that
procedure?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
really
no
precedent
at
all,
is
your
submission,
for
the
government's...
the
third
part
of
the
government's
brief?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
policy,
of
course,
you
can
make
some
very
strong
arguments
the
other
way.
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
worked
pretty
well.
they
pretty
well
limited
fact
requirement
almost
out
of
existence
in
its
notice
pleading.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
strongest
case
is
based
on
the
statute,
and
not
on
what
be
the
best
policy
for
congress
to
choose.
unknown
speaker
may
the
commission
file
a
charge
just
at
the
sheer
request
of
another
party?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
commission
just
gets
a
letter
from
somebody
that
complains
in
exactly
these
words
that
were
in
this
notice,
that
this
company
has
since
the
date
of
the
act
discriminated
against
women
and
blacks
in
certain
categories,
period,
and
the
commission
files
the
charge
in
those
very
words,
and
gives
notice
in
those
very
words.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
the
commission
may
not
file
a
charge
based
on
the
kind
of
a
letter
that
i
indicated.
unknown
speaker
so
that
any
kind
of
a
charge,
in
any
circumstance,
the
commission
must
satisfy
this
"circumstances"
requirement.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
whether
the
charge
in
this
case
was
facially
valid?
unknown
speaker
if
the
eighth
circuit
had
agreed
with
that,
they
would
have--
unknown
speaker
--you
are
saying,
though,
that
the
question
of
whether
the
circumstances
requirement
has
been
complied
with
is
something
that
can
be
raised
in
a
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
surely
there
is
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that,
mr.
wilkins.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
help
us
much.
is
it
yes
or
no?
is
the
answer
to
my
question
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
may
the
question
of
whether
the
circumstances
requirement
of
the
statute
has
been
complied
with
in
the
notice
be
raised
in
a
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
nobody
is
arguing
that
you
should
go
beyond
the
facial
validity.
shell
doesn't
contend
you
should
go
beyond
the
facial
validity.
we
are
just
saying
that
one
element
of
the
facial
validity
is
whether
the
circumstances
requirement
has
been
complied
with.
unknown
speaker
what
is
you
think
that
one
of
the
purposes
for
requiring
the
circumstances
was
to
assure
that
the
commission
didn't
have
unlimited
discretion
to
file
a
charge,
that
it
was
a
fact-based...
that
it
had
to
be
a
fact-based
charge.
if
the
commission
has
facts,
it
should
summarize
them
in
the
notice,
and
thereby
carry
out
congress's
intention
not
to
file
charges
just
for
the
purpose
of
having
an
investigation.
