mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
three
terms
ago
this
court
concluded
in
federal
trade
commission
versus
standard
oil
company
of
california
that
an
administrative
complaint
should
not
be
subjected
to
routine
judicial
review
to
determine
whether
it
had
been
properly
issued
because
such
review
necessarily
resulted
in
undue
delay
in
the
resolution
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
improperly
subjected
or
rendered
the
prosecuting
agency
the
defendant
at
the
very
outset
of
its
proceeding,
and
in
the
end
resulted
in
unnecessary
and
piecemeal
appellate
review.
although
this
case
arises
in
a
somewhat
different
context,
it
presents
a
very
similar
issue,
that
is,
whether
there
must
be
a
trial
and
a
consequent
judicious
or
appellate
review,
with
all
the
attendant
delays,
of
the
question
whether
or
not
a
complaint
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
has
been
properly
issued.
the
practical
considerations
that
compelled
this
court's
result
in
the
socal
case
requires
similar
result
here.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
misspoke.
i
meant
some
sort
of
a
hearing,
some
sort
of
judicial
probing
into
those
facts.
on
october
16,
1979,
eleanor
holmes
north,
who
was
then
chair
of
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
issued
a
sworn
commissioner's
complaint
against
the
respondent,
shell
oil
company,
alleging
unlawful
employment
practices
of
shell's
wood
river,
illinois,
refinery.
commissioner
norton
stated
that
she
had
cause
to
believe
that
the
respondent
had
unlawfully
excluded
blacks
from
managerial,
professional,
technical,
office
clerical
craft,
and
service
worker
positions,
and
had
similarly
excluded
women
from
managerial,
professional,
technical
craft,
operative
labor,
and
service
worker
positions.
a
copy
of
the
charge
was
duly
filed
on
the
respondent,
and
it
was
subsequently
amended
to
state
that
commissioner
norton
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
acts
had
occurred
on
a
continuing
basis
since
at
least
july
1965.
the
commission
then
began
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
support
the
allegations
of
commissioner
norton's
complaint.
the
commission,
pursuant
to
section
709(a)
of
the
act,
requested
the
respondent
to
provide
certain
employment
information.
the
respondent,
on
the
basis
of
its
own
statistical
analysis,
refused,
arguing
that
its
employment
practices
did
not...
"were
clearly
not
the
profile
anticipated
for
a
commissioner's
charge.
"
after
informal
methods
of
administrative
investigation
failed,
the
commission
filed
a
subpoena
pursuant
to
section
710,
and
the
respondent
filed
this
action
to
squash
the
subpoena
and
enjoin
the
commission's
investigation.
the
respondent
argued
that
commissioner
norton
had
not
shown
sufficient
facts
to
form
a
basis
for
her
allegations
of
discrimination.
the
district
court
dismissed
these
factual
specificity
arguments
as
meritless
and
enforced
the
commission's
subpoena.
on
appeal,
the
eighth
circuit
reversed,
however,
finding
that
there
was
indeed
insufficient
factual
basis
to
support
the
charge.
on
denial
of
a
hearing
en
banc,
chief
judge
lay
of
the
eighth
district
dissented,
stating
that
the
decision
placed
the
circuit
in
direct
conflict
with
the
decisions
of
all
other
courts
of
appeal
addressing
the
issue
of
factual
allegations
in
a
title
vii
charge.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
he
was
alone
in
the
dissent
as
far
as
i
am
aware.
as
noted
by
chief
judge
lay,
the
single
most
significant
characteristic
of
the
decision
below
is
that
it
does
fly
in
the
face
of
previously
uniform
precedent
rejecting
any
factual
pleading
requirement
for
title
vii
charges.
indeed,
since
the
decision
below
was
rendered,
two
additional
courts
of
appeals
have
looked
at
the
question
and
have
concluded
that
the
factual
pleading
requirement
created
by
the
court
below
is
inappropriate
and
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
title
vii
enforcement
scheme.
this
court
has
recognized
that
title
vii
creates
an
integrated,
multi-step
enforcement
procedure
culminating
in
the
commission's
authority
to
bring
an
enforcement
action
in
federal
court.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
exactly.
section
707
of
the
civil
rights
act
authorizes
the
commission
to...
authorizes
a
member
of
the
commission
to
file
a
complaint
based
upon
a
suspected
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
section
706(b)
requires
that
that
charge
be
in
writing,
under
oath
or
affirmation,
and
contain
such
information
and
be
in
such
form
as
the
commission
requires.
section
706(b)
also
requires
that
within
ten
days,
the
commission
serve
a
copy
or
a
notice
of
the
charge
on
the
respondent
containing
the
date,
place
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
but
the
purpose
of
a
charge,
and
the
purpose
of
the
notice
of
the
charge
under
section
706(b)
have
quite
discrete
and
limited
functions.
the
charge
does
not
begin
in
any
sort
of
formal
enforcement
action.
it
does
not
have,
in
the
words
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
involving
similar
issues,
"it
does
not
have
determinative
consequences
on
the
respondent.
"
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
you
have
to
look
at
what
purpose
congress
intended
that
notice
provision
to
serve.
as
we
explain
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
prior
to
1972,
when
that
provision
was
added
to
the
act,
the
commission,
to
prevent
retaliation
against
complaining
parties,
developed
a
practice
or
adopted
a
practice
of
not
serving
a
notice
of
the
charge
or
a
copy
of
the
charge
on
the
respondent
until
commission
staff
was
available
to
begin
investigation.
congress
was
concerned
in
1972
that
this
practice
resulted
in
some
delay
between
the
time
that
the
charge
was
filed
and
the
time
the
respondent
was
aware
that
the
charge
was
indeed
pending.
so
it
adopted
this
notice
provision
to
ensure
that,
in
the
words
of
the
legislative
report,
"they
would
have
fair
notice
that
charges
were
pending
against
them.
"
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
and
this
charge
fully
complied
with
that
requirement.
the
charge
in
this
case
informed
the
respondent
that
a
commission
of
the
eeoc
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
discriminated
against
blacks
by
excluding
them
from
six
specifically
designated
job
categories,
and
women
from
seven
specifically
designated
job
categories
since
at
least
july
1965.
it
gave
them
fair
notice
of
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
there
is
a
two-fold
answer
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
not
getting
into
that
kind
of
detail
at
the
very
outset.
on
the
initial
level,
this
is
a
pattern
of
practice
charge,
as
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
recognized.
the
pattern
of
practice
charge
is
not
based
on
specific,
individual
kinds
of
occurrences.
it
is
based
on
broad,
general
occurrences
that
take
place
over
a
period
of
time.
so
it
is
impossible,
it
really
is
impossible
to
describe
it
beyond
general
terms.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
as
the
ninth
circuit
noted
in
the
dean
witter
case,
to
require
the
commission
to
get
into
providing
a
certain
level
of
factual
specificity,
or
providing
the
statistics,
would
merely
prompt,
as
what
has
happened
in
this
case,
the
respondent
would
come
back
and
say,
"but
my
statistics
show
that...
our
bottomline
statistics
show
that
we
are
in
conformity.
"
"your
statistics
aren't
adequate
to
commence
this
investigation.
"
going
back
to
general
notions
of
modus
pleading--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--as
professor
moore
stated
in
his
treatise
on
civil
procedure,
just
as
a
general
precept,
a
requirement
that
facts
be
pleaded
in
a
charge
is
illusory
and
unsound.
it
said
that
results
in
a
battle
of
the
form
of
pleadings.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
am
not
certain.
i
believe
that
that
probably
would
be
insufficient,
but
here
we
don't
have
that
sort
of
a
charge.
they
have
been
given
the
circumstances.
they
have
been
told
that
they
excluded
blacks
from
designated
categories,
and
women
from
designated
categories.
perhaps
if
you
understand
the
purpose
or
how
the
title
vii
enforcement
scheme
proceeds,
it
would
help
you
understand.
the
charge
under
section
706
does
not
commence
a
formal
enforcement
action.
it
merely
commences
administrative
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
allegations
of
the
charge
are
true.
when
such
reasonable
cause
is
found,
then
the
commission
attempts
to
conciliate
the
employment
dispute
and
settle.
only
if
such
efforts
fail,
do
you
commence
the
formal
enforcement
action.
therefore,
in
light
of
the
limited
function
that
the
charge
serves,
requiring
the
commission
to
come
forth
to
present
its
facts,
present
its
proof
at
the
very
outset
is
inappropriate.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
but,
justice
renquist,
congress
in
1964
said
that
a
commissioner's
charge
had
to
state
its
facts,
and
the
courts
never
required
that
as
requiring
any
sort
of
factual
pleading.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
believe,
when
you
look
at
the
purpose
and
the
overall
title
vii
enforcement
scheme,
i
believe
they
were
indeed
sound
decisions.
in
1972--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
uniform
position
that
has
been
taken
since
1964,
beginning
in
the
early
'70s,
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
local
104
sheetmetal
workers,
was
that
the
purpose
of
the
charge
is
merely
to
commence
an
administrative
investigation
and
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
is
reasonable
cause.
because
that
is
at
the
very
outset,
it
is
merely
a
prelude
to
the
formal
enforcement
sorts
of
proceedings,
it
clearly
would
be
an
anomaly
to
require
the
commission
to
present
more
facts,
more
factually
specific
material
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
administrative
investigation
than
it
needs
to
present,
indeed,
to
start
a
formal
enforcement
action
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
courts
reasoned
this
way.
section
707
in
1964
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
bring
a
pattern
of
practice
charge.
that
section
also
required
the
attorney
to
set
forth
the
facts
upon
which
it
was
based,
and
the
courts
uniformly
construed
that
as
saying,
we
don't
believe
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
have
to
state
all
of
the
facts
underlying
its...
the
attorney
general
to
state
all
the
facts
underlying
its
cause
of
action
at
the
very
outset.
the
courts
viewed
that,
well,
then,
if
you
are
initiating
merely
an
administrative
proceeding
before
that,
we
will
not
impose
a
greater
factual
specificity
burden
at
the
outset
than
we
do
to
file
the
formal
enforcement
action.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
i
believe
that
that
was
filed
along
with
the--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--it
suggests
to
me,
justice
powell,
that
the
commission
has
sufficient
facts
to
have
reason
to
believe
there
is
indeed
a
pattern
of
practice
of
discrimination.
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
investigation
is
to
determine
what
the
actual
cause
of
the
pattern
of
practice
that
the
commission
has.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
are
standard
requests
that
are
made.
they
are
detailed
to
the
particular
needs
of
each
case.
this
is
not
a
standard
request
that
is
just
churned
case
after
case.
there
are
elements
that
are
asked
in
particular
cases.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
it
does.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
am
certain
that
i
would
sit
down
and
recognize
that
i
was
going
to
be
busy
for
the
next
little
while.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
i
have
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
there's
a
couple
of
things
to
keep
to
bear
in
mind
on
this
question.
first,
the
commission
has
offered
to
send
in
its
staff
to
help
compile
this
information.
the
commission
has
also
offered
to
pay--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--the
commission
also
has
procedures
where
it
will
help
pay
for
the
development
of
this
information.
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
this
information
sought
was
relevant
to
the
administrative
investigation,
and
the
compliance
with
the
request
or
with
the
subpoena
was
not
unduly
burdensome.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disagree
with
that.
so
while
it
may
be
extensive,
and
i
don't
disagree
that
it
is
extensive
and
that
it
would
require
some
substantial
looking,
the
commission
has
offered
to
help
in
that
looking,
has
offered
to
help
pay
for
that
looking,
and
the
lower
court
did
not
find
it
unduly
burdensome.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
is
the
exact
purpose
of
the
conciliation
and
administrative
litigation.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
the
purpose
of
the
charge...
in
this
case,
we
had
from
our
analysis
of
the
eeo-1
reports
that
had
been
filed
by
the
respondent,
there
were
indications,
statistical
indications
that
shell
had
engaged...
had
excluded
blacks
and
women
from
certain
job
categories.
it
is
not
clear
from
those
eeo-1
reports
at
the
very
outset
exactly
what
happened,
what's
going
on,
what
the
underlying
facts
are.
congress
recognized
that
this
would
be
the
case
and
it
would
be
the
case
at
the
very
beginning
of
these
systemic
charges.
they're
difficult
to
prove.
they're
difficult
to
know...
exactly
what
has
happened
over
a
period
of
years.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
well,
congress
was
aware
in
1972
that
the
commission
needed
more
enforcement
power
and
needed
more
investigatory
power.
indeed,
they
expressly
empowered
the
commission
in
1972
to
file
these
pattern
of
practice
charges
because,
as
you
read
in
the
legislative
reports,
the
commission
has
access
to
the
statistical
analyses,
it
has
access
to
this
information.
because
they
knew
that
this
information
would
be
somewhat
sketchy
at
the
outset,
it
provided
for
this
administrative
investigation
for
the...
it
provided
the
commission
with
the
authority
to
request
to
inspect
copy,
to
subpoena
information
to
find
out
what
is
going
on.
the
commission
only
undertakes
conciliation
efforts
or,
indeed,
formal
enforcement
actions
after
it
has
looked
at
facts
and
determined
that
there
is
reasonable
cause.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
for
the
exact
reason
that
has
occurred
in
this
case.
we
allege
we
gave
them
the
circumstances,
we
told--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--in
this
case,
we
told
them
that
they
excluded
women
from
seven
designated
job
categories,
and
blacks
from
six
designated
job
categories.
we
told
them
what
we
believed
they
had
done.
they
argued,
well,
you
don't
have
enough
facts
to
prove
that
right
now.
our
response
is,
of
course,
we
don't,
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
administrative
investigation.
congress
didn't
require
us,
congress
does
not
require
us
to
have
reasonable
cause
at
this
point.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
certainly,
we
had
facts
to
back
up
those
allegations.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
it
may
be
wise,
and
the
commissioners,
the
individual
commissioners
of
the
eeoc
certainly
have
discretion
to
give
those
facts.
but
any
judicially
imposed
requirement
that
the
commission
set
forth
its
facts
will
clearly,
as
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
congress--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--that
is
right.
let's
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
706(b)
for
a
moment.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
that
is
how
you
can
understand
the
language,
that
is
why
i
want
to
look
at
the
history.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
in
'64,
congress
provided
that
commissioner's
charges
could
only
be
filed
when
they
set
forth
the
facts
on
which
they
were
based,
and
the
commissioner
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
of
the
act
had
occurred.
in
1972,
as
part
of
legislation
that
was
generally
designed,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
to
increase
the
enforcement
powers
of
the
commission,
congress
deleted
these
two
requirements
and
rendered
commissioner's
charges
subject
to
the
exact
same
requirements
generally
applicable
to
all
charges,
that
is,
they
must
be
in
writing,
under
oath
or
affirmation,
and
contain
such
information
and
be
in
such
form
as
the
commission
requires.
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
factor
that
clearly
was
overlooked
by
the
court
below.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
but
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
justice
white,
was,
as
i
have
said
earlier,
merely
to
provide
that
the
respondent
had
some
notice
of
that
charge.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
charge
could
be...
could
provide
that.
the
notice,
then,
would
have
to
provide
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
but
the
commission
certainly
could
choose
to
say
that
the
charge
will
have
this
information,
and
not
necessarily
include
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
the
notice
would
have
to
include
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
purpose
of
the
notice
provision
was
as
we
said,
merely
to
provide
notice.
the
word
"circumstances"
does
not
in
and
of
itself
indicate
some
sort
of
a
congressional
intent
to
set
forth
the
facts.
indeed,
congress
in
1972
deleted
the
requirement
that
the
commissioner's
charge
would
set
forth
the
facts.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
right.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
justice
o'connor,
if
you
look
at
the
comments
that
were
made
and
the
comments
in
the
legislative
report,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
congress
felt
that
they
were
imposing
any
sort
of
a
new
factual
pleading
requirement
or
any
kind
of
disclosure
requirement.
when
they
talked
about
notice,
they
talked
merely
about
informing
the
respondent
that
a
charge
was
actually
pending
against
them,
so
that
the
respondent
could
begin
to
prepare
its
defense
and
gather
the
information
to
sustain
itself.
the
charge
in
this
case
clearly
performs
those
functions.
they
don't
need
more
information
to
be
able
to
know
that
the
charge
is
pending,
to
be
able
to
gather
their
information,
to
be
able
to
sustain
themselves
during
the
administrative
investigation.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
no,
we
are
not
really
making
any
of
those
assertions,
if
i
understand
what
you
are
getting
at.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
our
position
based
on
socal
is
that
the
issuance
of
an
administrative
complaint
is
something
that
can
always
be
challenged.
if
the
respondent
in
this
case...
there
is
always
some
sort
of
a
standard,
whether
it
is
reasonable
cause,
or
reason
to
believe--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--after
the
socal
case...
after
the
socal
decision,
of
course,
they
can't
bring
an
initial
proceeding
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
in
this
case,
the
only
reason
this
question
arose
is
because
there
is
a
subpoena
enforcement
action,
and
they're
still
trying
to
make
the
same
sort
of
an
argument,
that
somehow
this
charge
was
improperly
issued.
the
government's
response
is
that
the
rationale
of
the
socal
case
applied
across
the
board
at
this
point.
this
has
no
determinative
requirement.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
the
sufficiency
of
the
charge
is
to
be
determined
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
the
subpoena--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
just
one
or
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
specified,
or
the
government
specified
in
its
charge
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
respondent's
alleged
discriminatory
conduct.
the
statute
simply
does
not
require
us
to
file
a
bill
of
particulars
before
we
can
begin
administrative
investigation.
mr.
justice
stevens,
responding
to
your
inquiry
regarding
socal,
we
believe...
the
government
believes
that
it
is
very
clear
that
you
should
not,
even
in
a
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding,
inquire
beyond
the
facial
validity
of
the
charge.
this
charge
in
this
case
was
facially
valid.
indeed,
the
court's
prior
precedent
in
subpoena
enforcement
cases
is
very
clear
that
inquiry
is
limited--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--we
gave
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
alleged
discriminatory
conduct.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
they
wanted
more
than
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
they
wanted
the
facts.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--well,
the
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding
should
not
become
a
forum
for
broad-base
inquiry
into
such
questions
as
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
more
facts,
whether
they
could
have
given
more
information.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
if
you
could
restate
your
question,
i
will
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer.
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
yes,
but
it
should
be
determined
on
the
face
of
the
subpoena
enforcement...
on
the
face
of
the
charge
itself.
if
you
go
beyond
that,
as
we
state
on
page
45
of
our
brief,
we
list
a
whole
range
of
administrative
agencies
that
have
some
sort
of
sufficiency
requirement
before
they
can
commence
their
investigation,
they
must
base
a
charge
on
reasonable
cause,
et
cetera...
if
the
court
goes
beyond
facial
validity,
the
first
salvo
in
any
sort
of
litigation
is
going
to
be
whether
or
not
the
charging
party
had
enough
facts.
in
civil
litigation
in
district
court,
it
could
become--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--exactly.
but
the
only
purpose
of
the
circumstances
requirement
will
be
to
give
some
sort
of
notice.
in
this
case,
that
purpose
has
been
fulfilled.
if
they
had
more
specific
facts,
if
they
had
a
more
precise
date,
as
they
claim
they
need,
or
more
precise
factual
underpinning
that
it
was
in
the
broom
that
they
were
excluded,
instead
of
just
from
the
general
eeo-1
categories,
that
wouldn't
limit
the
administrative
investigation.
the
administrative
investigation
can
still
inquire
into
the
patterns
of
practices
outside
the
specifics
of
the
charge.
so
the
supposed
benefits
of
giving
them
the
specifics
and
the
factual
specifics
are
simply
illusory,
because--
mr.
richard
g.
wilkins
--that
argument
makes
some
sense
assuming
that
that
is
what
congress
indeed
did.
the
government
submits
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
impose
such
a
requirement.
