mr.
robert
e.
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court's
permission.
i
believe
the
questions
that
the
court
has
asked
this
morning
focus
on
the
narrow
issue
that
is
presented
in
this
case,
and
that
is
what
congress
meant
when
it
specified
in
section
706(b)
that
the
respondent
in
a
title
vii
proceeding
must
be
notified
of
the
date,
place,
and
circumstances
of
the
violations
alleged
in
the
charge.
the
commission
is
here
arguing
for
an
interpretation
which
in
our
view
would
effectively
read
the
words
"date,
place,
and
circumstances.
"
out
of
the
text
of
the
statute.
they
maintain
that
the
only
notice
the
commission
is
required
to
give
to
a
respondent
is
notice
of
the
fact
that
a
charge
is
pending
against
it.
at
no
time,
at
least
until
this
morning,
has
the
commission
acknowledged
any
obligation
to
provide
anything
more
than
bare
notice
of
the
existence,
of
the
pendency
of
the
charge.
perhaps
counsel's
qualified
concession
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
may
indicate
that
there
may
be
some
need
to
provide
something
more
than
bare
notice
of
existence,
but
whether
it
actually
requires
that
a
date,
a
place,
or
any
circumstances
at
all
be
set
forth
has
never
been
clarified
from
the
commission
standpoint.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
which
brings
us
back,
your
honor,
to
the
basic
question
which
is
what
did
congress
mean
by
that
word
"circumstances".
we
think
the
eighth
circuit
was
right
when
it
concluded
that
notice
of
date,
place,
and
circumstances
was
intended
to
provide
something
more
meaningful
than
a
bare
recitation
of
categories
of
alleged
unlawful
employment
practices.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
the
word
"circumstances",
your
honors,
generally,
in
dictionary
definitions
and
in
court
opinions,
is
tied
to
facts.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
at
a
minimum...
i
think
what
the
eighth
circuit
required
in
its
decision
really
sets
forth
a
very
minimal
standard.
it
has
been
argued--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--in
an
instance
such
as
this,
where
the
charge
apparently
is
based
on
statistics,
the
eighth
circuit
indicated
that
the
fact
that
the
charge
is
based,
at
least
in
part,
on
statistics,
the
general
nature
of
the
statistical
data
relied
on--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--well
frankly,
of
course,
we
are
at
a
disadvantage
because
we
don't
know
for
sure
what
this
charge
was
based
on.
the
government
has
some
forward
belatedly
and
made
some
assertions
about
what
the
charge
was
based
on,
but
because
the
charge
itself
or
the
notice
did
not
include
any
explication,
we
don't
really
know.
but
assuming
that
their
representations
are
correct,
and
that
this
charge
was
based
on
statistical
compilations,
comparisons
between
internal
data
that
the
company
had
provided
to
the
eeoc
with
standard
data
referring
to
availability
in
the
labor
market,
i
think
what
the
eighth
circuit
was
indicating
is
the
fact
that
those
data
were
used,
the
general
nature
of
the
data,
including
dates
that
would
enable
the
respondent
to
identify
what
the
commission
was
basing
this
charge
on,
that
is
all
that
seems
to
be
required.
the
court
also
indicated
that
in
the
instance
where
there
is
an
individual
charge
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
commissioner's
charge
that
the
identity
of
the
individual
need
not
be
disclosed,
but
that
the
fact
that
it
is
based
on
an
individual
charge,
coupled
with
some
indication
of
the
position
held
by
that
individual,
ought
to
be
provided.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
that
would
certainly
set
forth
the
circumstances.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
the
charge
said
that
it
charged
shell
with
discriminating
in
various
forms
of
employment
practice
against
blacks
and
women.
it
did
not--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--it
didn't
say
that
the
commission
had
considered
that
there
were
none
in
certain
sections.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
that
information
did
not
come
forward
until
much
later
on
in
this
litigation,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--the
joint
appendix
sets
forth
documents,
about
six
months
of
correspondence
and
meetings
between
shell
and
the
commission.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
position.
during
those
meetings
and
in
that
correspondence,
the
company
repeatedly
asked
the
commission
point
blank,
"what
is
this
charge
based
on?
"
"what
statistics
have
you
considered,
if
you
are
basing
it
on
statistics?
"
the
commission's
response
was
a
consistent
stonewall.
the
answer
that
came
back
was,
"we
don't
have
to
tell
you.
"
"you
are
invading
our
agency
privilege.
"
mr.
robert
e.
williams
of
course,
the--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--the
company
has
facts,
and
the
agency
purportedly
has
some
facts
that
it
has
considered
in
determining
to
bring
this
charge.
but
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
the
agency
has
complied
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
giving
a
sufficient
indication
of
what
the
charge
is
based
on
in
order
to
meet
the
notice
requirement.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
we
are
not
here
disputing
the
commission's
broad
investigatory
power
or
their
subpoena
power
once
a
valid
charge
and
notice
has
been
provided.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
the
question
of
its
relevance,
of
course,
would
be
determined
under
the
usual
standards
of
subpoena
enforcement
procedures,
but
it
is
a
standard
that
is
easily
met
at
that
stage,
and
we
are
not
arguing
that
they
can't
look
into
those
materials
given
a
valid
charge
and
notice.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
no,
and
that
is
not
the
concern.
in
fact,
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
prospect
of
litigation
would
be...
of
that
type
of
litigation
would
be
reduced,
rather
than
increased,
by
letting
the
respondent
know
upfront
what
the
charge
is
based
on.
if
a
adequate
charge
and
valid
notice
is
given,
then
really
the
only
complaint
that
a
respondent
could
raise
is
if
it
could
affirmatively
show
that
there
has
been
some
abuse
of
discretion
or
that
the
commission
is
clearly
acting
outside
the
scope
of
its
powers.
that
would
be
in
the
very
unusual
situation.
we
think
that
these
concerns
about
a
flood
of
mini-trials
at
the
outset
of
every
case
are
greatly
overstated.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
that's
not
our
argument,
your
honor,
no.
i
would
like
to
address--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
no,
we're
really...
given
the
posture
in
which
the
case
is
before
this
court,
we
are
really
only
dealing
with
the
subpoena
enforcement
procedure.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
every
case
that
we
are
aware
of
that
has
involved
these
requirements
of
the
sufficiency
of
a
commission
charge,
the
dean
witter
case,
the
k-mart
case,
the
staley
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
none
of
those
cases
has
held
that
the
respondent
can't
charge
the
sufficiency
of
the
subpoena...
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
charge
in
the
subpoena
enforcement
proceeding.
they
have
all
allowed
that
charge.
none
of
them
have
been
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
the
socal
case.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
we
are
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
address
the
legislative
history
briefly
in
response
to
some
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made.
first,
the
fact
is,
there
is
nothing
in
this
legislative
history
that
bears
directly
on
the
intended
meaning
of
the
words
"date,
place,
and
circumstances.
"
we
take
that
as
a
point
in
our
favor
because
it
means
there
is
no
basis
for
giving
those
words
anything
other
than
their
ordinary,
everyday
meaning.
secondly,
what
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
was
not
willing
to
give
this
commission
completely
unbridled,
roving
investigative
powers.
they
set
this
up
as
a
charged
based
agency,
rather
than
an
agency
with
a
self-initiating
investigative
process
like
the
ftc,
and
other
agencies.
to
the
extent
that
they
gave
commission
members
authority
to
file
charges,
congress
took
pains
to
see
that
that
authority
would
not
lead
to
abuse,
and
particularly
to
fishing
expeditions.
that
is
why
the
1964
act
required
reasonable
cause
before
a
commissioner
could
file
a
charge.
the
concern
about
fishing
expeditions
was
very
explicit
in
the
1964
legislative
history.
that
same
basic
concern
is
reflected
again
in
the
compromise
that
was
reached
in
the
conference
committee
on
the
1972
amendments
with
regard
to
the
authority
for
the
requirements
for
issuance
of
commissioner's
charges.
the
senate
bill
would
have
cut
back
on
the
authority
for
commissioner's
charges
to
allow
their
use
only
where
there
was
an
individual
claiming
to
be
aggrieved,
who
wished
to
be
anonymous.
the
senate
bill
added
the
oath
requirement
and
added
the
new
notice
language
requiring
notice
of
date,
place,
and
circumstances.
in
conference,
the
senate
receded
with
respect
to
the
provision
that
there
needed
to
be
an
individual
claiming
to
be
aggrieved
who
didn't
wish
to
come
forward,
but
the
senate
prevailed
with
respect
to
the
addition
of
the
oath
and
the
notice
requirement.
given
this
history,
we
think
that
it
is
simply
not
accurate
to
argue,
as
the
government
does,
that
the
'72
amendments
simply
eliminated
any
and
all
factual
pleading
requirements
or
any
requirement
to
articulate
the
basis
for
a
charge.
what
it
did
was,
it
replaced
general
language
of
the
'64
act,
which
required
that
a
charge
set
forth
the
facts
on
which
it's
based,
with
specific
language
requiring
notice
of
date,
place
and
circumstances,
and
the
oath.
the
point
is,
for
the
first
time
it
spelled
out
three
particular
elements
that
have
to
be
disclosed
to
every
respondent
before
a
title
vii
investigation
can
proceed.
we
also
think
that
it
is
significant
that
when
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
bring
pattern
of
practice
cases
under
section
707
of
the
statute
was
transferred
to
the
commission
after
the
'72
amendments,
that
authority
was
also
made
subject
to
the
requirements
that
there
be
a
valid
charge
under
oath,
and
supported
by
notice.
those
requirements
had
not
been
present
when
that
authority
was
in
the
hands
of
the
attorney
general.
we
think
the
fact
that
they
were
added
when
the
authority
passed
to
the
commission
again
illustrates
the
unwillingness
of
congress
to
give
this
commission
completely
self-initiating
investigative
powers.
given
this
background,
we
submit
that
insofar
as
commissioner's
charges
can
be
used
to
initiate
investigations
without
an
independent
request
from
an
outside
party,
that
the
formal
oath
and
notice
requirements
that
congress
imposed
must
be
enforced
strictly...
we
are
not
saying
hypertechnically,
but
literally...
in
order
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
reasons
why
congress
set
this
up
a
charge
based
investigative
process.
we
also
believe,
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
context
of
these
provisions
in
the
statute,
that
the
oath
and
notice
requirements
ought
to
be
read
as
interrelated.
if
a
charge
didn't
have
to
contain
any
facts
or
any
specific
indication
of
what
it
is
based
on,
the
oath
would
become
practically
meaningless.
we
don't
think
congress
intended
that,
we
think
they
perceived
this
as
a
meaningful
requirement.
given
the
statutory
context,
it
seems
clear
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
information
that
would
have
to
be
in
the
notice
would
come
from
the
charge.
therefore,
there
would
be
a
statement
under
oath
setting
forth
these
basic
details.
the
commission
has
stressed
that
the
statute
gives
it
the
authority
to
specify
the
form
and
content
of
charges.
but,
your
honors,
that
does
not
empower
the
commission
to
repeal
the
basic
statutory
requirements
pertaining
to
notice,
those
elements
have
to
be
present.
as
long
as
they're
satisfied,
sure,
the
commission
can
require
as
much
or
as
little
other
information
in
whatever
form
it
sees
fit.
the
commission
has
also
argued
that
its
regulations
have
consistently
provided
that
a
charge
is
sufficient
if
identifies
the
parties
and
generally
describes
the
action
or
practice
complained
of.
the
fact
is,
the
regulations
relied
on
by
the
commission
for
that
point,
it's
section
1601.12(b)
of
the
current
regulations,
was
not
adopted
until
1978.
that
regulation
supplanted
the
earlier
regulation,
1601.11(b),
which
said
that
a
charge
would
be
"deemed
filed
if
it
identified
the
parties,
and
generally
described
the
action
or
practice
complained
of.
"
both
versions
then
provide
that
a
charge,
after
being
filed,
can
be
amended
to
correct
technical
defects
of
omissions.
the
difference
is
that
the
current
regulation
provides
that
such
a
charge
is
sufficient
without
being
amended,
whereas
the
earlier
version
prior
to
1978
required
only
that
the
charge
be...
provided
only
that
such
a
charge
would
be
deemed
filed.
finally,
with
regard
to
the
commission's
regulations,
we
think
the
court
should
be
particularly
cautious
about
deferring
to
the
commission's
standards
for
a
valid
charge
insofar
as
they
are
applied
to
the
commission's
own
members.
it
may
be
necessary
at
times
to
apply
formal
requirements
leniently
in
order
to
avoid
injustice
to
individuals
who
may
not
be
sophisticated
in
the
procedures.
but
we
see
no
reason
why
the
commission
shouldn't
hold
its
own
members
to
a
standard
that
at
least
fully
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
burdensome
or
disruptive
about
requiring
the
commission
to
do
that.
no
one
is
arguing
here
that
the
commission
has
to
disclose
its
entire
investigative
file,
all
the
facts
in
its
possession,
that
is
certainly
not
what
the
eighth
circuit
required.
we
feel
that
that
is
the
fallacy
of
those
courts...
the
other
circuits
that
have
ruled
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
give
effect
to
the
circumstances
requirement
of
the
statute.
they
failed
to
see
that
there
is
a
middle
ground
here.
there
need
not
be
a
choice
between
a
strict
factual...
detailed
factual
pleading
requirement
on
the
one
hand,
and
no
standard
at
all
on
the
other.
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
policy,
early
disclosure
of
the
basic
facts
that
the
commission
relied
on
in
deciding
to
file
a
charge
would
help
to
focus
the
issues;
would
lay
a
better
groundwork
for
conciliation;
would
assist
both
the
commission,
district
offices,
and
the
respondent
in
identifying
facts
and
data
that
might
be
relevant;
would
help
to
promote
early
voluntary
compliance--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--i
would
agree
that
the
principal
argument
is
based
on
the
statute.
i
do
think,
though,
your
honor,
that
in
a
statute
such
as
this,
which
places
such
heavy
emphasis
on
voluntary
compliance
and
conciliation,
it
is
relevant
to
consider
the
impact
that
the
commission's
stonewall
approach
of
not
disclosing
anything
has
on
the
relationships
between
the
parties
at
the
early
stage.
if
the
respondent
knows
basically
what
the
commission
is
basing
its
case
on,
he
may
be
able
in
many
cases
to
come
forward
with
an
explanation
or
some
exculpatory
data
at
the
very
outset
of
the
investigation
that
will
obviate
the
need
for
this
kind
of
extremely
time-consuming,
and
expensive
probing
into
every
aspect
of
its
employment
practices.
so
we
think
that
that
policy
consideration
is
simply...
is
consistent
with
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
haven't
said
much
to
this
point
about
the
date
requirement,
your
honors.
obviously,
the
date
of
an
alleged
violation
is
somewhat
more
difficult
to
spell
out
in
a
case
involving
a
continuing
practice,
or
an
alleged
continuing
practice
of
discrimination,
than
it
is
in
an
individual
discharge
situation.
but
we
still
think
that
a
fair
construction
of
section
706(b)
requires
something
more
specific
than
a
mere
reference
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
particularly
where
there
is
nothing
else
recited
in
the
charge
that
would
indicate
any
basis
for
the
selection
of
that
date.
in
other
words,
the
date
and
circumstances
notifications
may
compliment
one
another.
the
circumstances
when
properly
set
forth
should
indicate
why
the
date
chosen
is
a
good
faith
estimate
of
the
probable
time
periods
of
the
violations.
a
date
that
would
be
insufficient
standing
alone,
might
be
sufficient
in
the
context
of
a
recitation
of
circumstances.
in
the
worst
offender
situation
that
the
government
cites,
it
should
be
relatively
easy
to
set
forth
circumstances
that
would
support
a
starting
date
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
act.
in
other
situations,
the
dates
may
have
to
be
more
specific
in
order
to
make
it
clear
what
the
circumstances
are
that
are
being
referred
to.
without
something
more
than
a
mere
insertion
of
the
july
2nd,
1965,
date
is
no
more...
is
really
no
more
informative
than
a
citation
to
the
act
itself.
in
summary,
let
me
just
emphasize
again
that
this
is
a
straightforward
case
of
statutory
construction.
to
uphold
the
commission's
construction
is
to
read
the
statute
as
if
the
words
"date,
place
and
circumstances"
were
not
there.
to
affirm
the
decision
below
is
to
give
those
words
their
ordinary
meaning.
this
does
not
require
a
choice
between
a
hypertechnical
pleading
standard
or
no
standard
at
all.
we
think
the
eighth
circuit
properly
perceived
a
middle
ground.
we
do
believe,
though,
your
honors,
that
since
the
case
is
here
that
some
further
clarification
of
what
the
terms
"date
and
circumstances"
mean
in
the
context
of
a
systemic
discrimination
case,
based
primarily
on
statistics,
might
be
helpful.
we
suggested
some
fairly
minimal
factors
in
our
brief
at
footnote
38
that
we
think
should
be
required
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
if
there
is
a
complaint
or
request
from
an
individual,
yes,
the
commissioner
can
file
a
charge
to--
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--i
think,
then,
your
honor,
the
charge
would
be
deficient
because
the
individual's
complaint
has
not
complied
with
the
basic
requirement
that
the
date,
place
and
circumstances
be
specified.
mr.
robert
e.
williams
not
without
something
more.
if
there
is
some...
i
think
it
is
appropriate,
your
honor,
to
interpret
those
terms
perhaps
somewhat
more
leniently
where
a
layperson,
an
individual
is
filing
the
charge.
the
commissioner's
charge
then
might
say,
"based
on
a
complaint
received
from
an
individual...
the
eighth
circuit
indicated
that
it
should--
"
mr.
robert
e.
williams
--yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
the
company
will
rest
on
its
brief.
