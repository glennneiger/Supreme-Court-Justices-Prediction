justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
bank
which,
instead
of
underwriting
notes
in
the
language
of
section
21,
were
to
simply
issue...
is
a
certificate
of
deposit
a
note
that's
issued
by
the
bank?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
prohibition
against
them
issuing
notes
in
section
21
somehow
doesn't
prevail
over
the
other
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
i
haven't
adequately
read
the
briefs.
where
else
are
these
express
authorities
granted,
and
what's
the
point
of
having
section
21,
which
prohibits
a
bunch
of
stuff,
if
it's
all
granted
somewhere
else?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
silent
as
to
what
it
prohibits,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
prohibits
any
organization
engaged
in
the
business
of
issuing
notes
from
taking
deposits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
a
bank
that
does
that
sort
of
business,
that
receives
deposits,
along
those
lines,
can't
issue
a
certificate
of
deposit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pitt,
do
you
contend
that
the
definitional
provisions
of
the
securities
acts
of
'33
and
'34
carry
over
to
the
glass-steagall
act,
which
really
doesn't
have
any
definitional
sections
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
mean
they
do
or
do
not
carry
over?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
contention
is
that
glass-steagall
didn't
set
up
the
sort
of
regulatory
regimen
that
the
sec
did,
where
you
have
an
agency
actively
policing
and
perhaps
changing
definitions?
glass-steagall
is
just
a
set
of
prohibitions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
term
21
is
kind
of
an
accordion-like
thing,
depending
on
what
authority
the
federal
reserve
bank
gives
to
people
like
the
bank
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
the
word
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act
be
given
its
normal
meaning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
logical?
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
three
words
and
two
of
them
are
long
term,
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
to
say,
well,
they
must
have
put
the
third
term
in
to
mean
short
term.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
that
sequence
of
words,
the
first
word
is
"stocks",
which
of
course
are
very
disparate
from
bonds
or
debentures.
