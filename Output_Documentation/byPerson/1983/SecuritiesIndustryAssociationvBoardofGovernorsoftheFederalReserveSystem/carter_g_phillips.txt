mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
federal
reserve
board's
determination,
made
on
the
basis
of
an
exhaustive
administrative
record,
that
the
business
of
executing
securities
transactions
on
exchanges
is
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto,
and
that
such
brokerage
activities
are
not
prohibited
to
bank
holding
companies
or
their
subsidiaries
by
the
glass-steagall
act.
in
that
regard,
it
is
probably
worthwhile
to
emphasize
once
more,
as
justice
o'connor
did
with
her
question,
to
remember
that
this
case
concerns
only
a
bank
holding
company
and
its
subsidiary.
it
does
not
involve
the
bank
and,
therefore,
precisely
what
banks
are
permitted
to
do,
and
have
engaged
in,
in
the
past
is
not
directly
controlling
on
the
outcome
of
this
case.
contrary
to
petitioner's
general
assertion--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--is
what,
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
question
of
what
a
bank
may
do
under
section
16
does
not
control
what
a
bank
holding
company
or
its
subsidiaries
can
do
under
section
20.
there
is
very
different
language.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
the
bank...
yes,
it...
well,
it
has
to
be
an
activity
that
is
closely
related
to
banking,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
activity
that
is
banking.
indeed,
this
court
said
as
much
in
the
ici
ii
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
not
have
to
be
an
activity
that
it
is
precisely
engaged
in,
no.
but
i
think
that
if
it
is
so
closely
related
to
banking
that
a
bank
would
be
perfectly
well
suited
to
engage
in
that
form
of
activity
that
that
would
be
fine.
especially
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
reason
why
banks
are
not
engaged
in
that
activity
are
not
so
much
dependent
on
the
law
as
they
are
on
the
financial
events
that
gave
rise
to
the
problem
in
the
first
instance.
i
think
that
it
is
important
to
understand
what
the
board
did
here
to
place
it
in
context.
in
the
1970s,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
unfixed
the
fees
that
brokers
charge...
can
charge
on
their...
for
executing
transactions
on
the
stock
exchanges.
this
pro-consumer
decision
led
directly
to
the
creation
a
new
form
of
financial
opportunity
from
this
discount
brokerage,
a
firm
such
as
schwab
emerged.
prior
to
that
time,
it
was
generally
not
possible
to
offer
fewer
services
for
a
lesser
fee.
in
the
early
1980s,
bankamerica,
realizing
what
an
opportunity
this
presented,
made
an
application
to
the
federal
reserve
board
to
acquire
the
charles
schwab
discount
brokerage
firm.
the
board
published
notice
of
the
proposed
acquisition
and
solicited
comments
from
the
public.
you
may
regard
it
as
probably
worthwhile,
and
this
will
also
reemphasize
again
that
this
case
involves
bank
holding
companies.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
expressly
passed
judgment
on
this
particular
issue,
and
did
not
oppose
the
acquisition
of
schwab
by
bankamerica's
holding
company.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
comptroller
did
not
oppose
either.
in
fact,
the
comptroller
very
vigorously
affirmed
that
decision,
frankly.
it
is
common
for
the
board
to
issue
a
4(c)(8)
order
based
solely
on
these
sorts
of
written
comment,
but
in
this
case
they
went
the
extra
step
and
set
the
matter
down
for
an
extensive
hearing
in
order
to
examine
this
new
form
of
commercial
opportunity.
first
the
administrative
law
judge,
and
then
the
board,
thoroughly
analyzed
the
history
of
brokerage
activities
undertaken
by
banks,
compared
them
with
the
specific
business
of
schwab.
both
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board
invoked
the
standards
that
had
been
applied
for
the
last
ten
years
regarding
what
is
closely
related
to
business,
those
standards
coming
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
1975
courier
case.
both
found
that
banks
generally
provide
services
that
are
operationally
and
functionally
so
similar
to
the
proposed
services
as
to
equip
them
particularly
well
to
provide
that
service.
both
the
administrative
law
judge
and
the
board
then
engaged
in
the
proper
incident
analysis
and
concluded
that
the
public
benefits
greatly
outweighed
any
detriments
that
might
arise.
it
is
our
view
that
procedurally
and
substantively,
the
board's
action
were
precisely
what
congress
envisioned
when
it
rejected
the
house's
attempt
to
narrowly
constrain
the
board's
discretion
in
dealing
with
the
what
is
closely
related
to
banking
by
bank
holding
companies.
that
determination
is
left
to
the
experience
and
the
expertise
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
and
it
has
made
a
judgment
in
this
case
as
to
what
businesses
can
properly
be
integrated
under
the
umbrella
of
a
bank
holding
company.
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
it
would
respect
that
kind
of
judgment
made
in
this
complex
financial
arena.
petitioners
challenge
that
the
board's
decision
is
based
solely
on
a
semantics
fortuity.
congress,
in
1970,
did
reject
a
mere
functional
relationship
test.
this
court
has
already
recognized
that
the
purpose
of
that
change
is
very
vague,
and
it
is
not
clear
precisely
what
congress
intended
by
its
actions
in
1970.
from
this,
petitioner
infers
that
the
board
is
precluded
from
ever
analyzing
these
problems
in
terms
of
functional
relationships.
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
the
decision
in
this
case
did
not
turn
on
mere
functional
relationship.
the
board
found
that
banks
have
traditionally
purchased
and
sold
securities
as
agent
for
their
customers.
in
over-the-counter
markets,
the
board
found
that
banks
oftentimes
perform
the
entire
function
of
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
precisely
what
the
finding
of
the
administrative
law
judge
were,
that
they
have
the
same
computer
operations,
they
have
the
same
training
personnel,
and
they
engage
in
exactly
the
same
kinds
of
judgments.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
effecting
a
purchase
and
sale
of
security,
there
is
no
difference.
with
regard
to
the
"without
recourse"
issue
that
the
petitioner
places
so
much
emphasis
on,
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
the
congress
did
not
intent
to
preclude
banks
from
transmitting
brokerage
exchange...
brokerage
transactions
in
a
way
that
they
had
to
designate
who
the
customer
was
in
order
to
avoid
liability
of
the
bank.
as
far
as
we
know,
banks
have
historically
collected
large
quantities
of
orders
and
just
shipped
them
off,
without
setting
out
exactly
who
the
customers
are.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
on
the
exchanges,
they
have
always
transmitted
them
to
a
broker.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
they
won't
have
to
now.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
true
that
it
is
somewhat
of
a
change
with
regard
to
the
exchanges,
but
the
basic...
but
the
bottom-line
is
that
it
is
still
an
activity.
this
court's
inquiry
should
be
limited
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
board
has
stated
a
connection
between
the
proposed
activity
and
what
banks
traditionally
do,
and
whether
it
is
rational
to
conclude
that
that
connection
is
a
close
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
course,
that
is
the
ultimate
inquiry,
but
congress...
congress
delegated
to
the
board
discretion
to
make
judgments,
to
employ
its
expertise
in
deciding
what
activities
are
closely
related
to
banking.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
of
course,
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
had
any
concern
about
mere
brokerage
activities
by
banks.
the
entire
debates
in
1933
and
again
in
1956
relate
to
the
problems
of
market,
market
collapse
of
large
issues
of
securities.
there
is
no
reference
in
any
of
that
history
to
the
mere
execution
of
a
brokerage
transaction,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
any
concern,
because
banks
did
not
fail
in
the
late
1920s
and
1930s...
in
the
early
1930s
because
they
executed
transactions
on
securities
exchanges.
banks
failed
because
they
engaged
in
investment
banking
practices
where
purchased
large
quantities
of
securities
and
those
securities
went
bad.
that
is
precisely
what
congress
prohibited,
not
anything
related
to
the
simple
execution
of
transactions.
indeed,
congress
expressly
allows
banks,
under
section
16,
to
purchase
and
sell
securities
as
agents
for
their
customers.
under
the
glass-steagall
act,
it
seems
to
us
that,
notwithstanding
petitioner's
repeated
reliance
on
section
16,
that
the
only
relevant
provision
is
section
20.
section
16,
by
its
terms,
relates
only
to
national
banks.
section
21,
also
relied
upon
by
petition,
only
relates
to
the
receipt
of
deposits,
and
it
is
undisputed
that
schwab
nor
bankamerica
do
not
receive
deposits,
and
neither
has
the
bank.
therefore,
it
makes
meaningless,
the
plain
meaning
role,
to
argue,
as
petitioner
does,
that
the
restrictions
imposed
under
those
provisions
should
be
borrowed
and
applied
willy-nilly
to
the
activities
of
a
bank
holding
company
that
has
its
own
specific
set
or
provisions
to
deal
with.
and
that
provision
is
section
20...
section
20,
by
its
terms,
prohibits
bank
affiliates
from
underwriting,
distributing,
issuing,
publicly
selling,
or
floating
blocks
of
securities.
that
is
not
an
across-the-board
condemnation
of
all
securities
activities.
that
is
a
condemnation
of
public
marketing
activities.
if
congress
had
intended
to
preclude
bank
affiliates
from
engaging
in
brokerage
activities,
it
would
surely
have
said
that
brokerage
activities
are
not
permissible,
or
at
least
it
would
have
used
the
term
"purchase
and
sale
of
securities
as
agent.
"
just
the
commonly
understood
definition
of
brokerage
functions.
congress
did
none
of
those
things.
instead,
it
drafted
the
language
in
a
way
that
makes
it
unmistakably
clear
that
it
is
intended
to
deal
solely
with
underwriting.
this
court
recognized
as
much
in
the
agnew
decision.
in
characterizing
the
meaning
of
the
identical
language
in
section
32
of
the
act,
this
court
repeatedly
described
it
as
involving
nothing
but
underwriting.
similarly,
that
interpretation
of
section
32,
as
not
embracing
brokerage...
mere
brokerage
activity,
was
adopted
by
the
federal
reserve
board
in
the
1930s
and
has
remained
unchanged
since
that
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
understanding
is
that
there
were
six
banks
at
that
time--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
maintained
seats
on
the
exchanges.
the
reason,
of
course--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--unfortunately,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
what
those
banks
did,
because
that
didn't
seem
to
be
a
major
issue
in
the
administrative
process.
but
we
do
know,
in
the
new
york
times
articles
that
discussed
those
investments,
those
banking
operations
that
went
to
commercial
banking
as
opposed
to
investment
banking,
that
they
prominently
stated
that
they
were
keeping
their
seats
on
the
exchanges,
and
one
can
only
assume
that
they
would
have
only
made
that
a
matter
of
serious
concern
if
they
planned
to
use
those
seats.
so
as
far
as
we
know,
some
banks
did
undertake
to
act
in
that
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
far
as
we
know
there
was
never
any
challenge,
and
petitioner
has
not
presented
us
with
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
has
ever
been
any
challenge.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
until
1957,
it
could
only
do
it
without
profit.
then
after...
and
then
most
recently
now,
it
can
do
it
in
any
situation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
ruling
did
derive
initially
from
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
began
to
erode
that
decision
in
1957,
soon
after
the
bank
holding
company
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
1982,
i
believe
it
was.
at
that
time,
he
explained
that
it
was
his
view
that
the
earlier
interpretation
was
not
predicated
on
anything
in
the
language
of
section
16,
but
appeared
by
all
accounts
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
very
conservative
reaction
to
the
problems
of
problem
failures.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
true,
they
both
can
be
regarded...
they
both
unquestionably
reasonable
interpretations
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language.
in
deciding
which
of
the
provisions
to
apply
in
this
case,
this
court
has
twice
rejected
efforts
to
incorporate
standards
from
one
section
in
glass-steagall
and
apply
to
other
activities.
in
agnew,
this
court
concluded
that
different
qualifying
phrases
used
in
the
provisions
mark
a
distinction
this
court
should
not
obliterate.
similarly,
in
ici
ii,
the
court
held
that
the
act's
structure
reveals
that
congressional
intent
to
treat
banks
separately
from
their
affiliate
and
to
impose
a
less
stringent
standard
on
bank
holding
companies.
adherence
to
those
principles
requires
the
conclusion
that
this
case
can
and
should
be
resolved
completely
by
reference
to
section
20
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
by
strongly
urging
the
court
to
limits
its
inquiry
to
section
20,
we
do
not,
however,
mean
to
imply
that
we
shy
away
from
scrutiny
by
this
court
under
sections
16
or
21,
by
their
terms
they
simply
do
not
apply.
but
if,
as
petitioner
seems
all
too
often
to
assume,
this
case
involved
a
national
bank,
our
submission
would
be
no
different.
like
their
affiliates,
national
banks
are
prohibited
from
underwriting
securities,
but
they
are
expressly
authorized,
as
one
of
their
many
delegated
powers,
to
purchase
and
sell
securities
on
behalf
of
their
customers
as
agent,
and
not
for
their
own
accounts.
in
other
words,
banks
would
appear
to
be
able
to
serve
as
a
broker.
this
grant
of
power
was
intended
in
1933
to
ratify
preexisting
practices
of
banks,
and
as
we
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
it
is
clear
that
banks
did
engage
in
the
purchase
and
sale
of
stock,
and
other
securities,
for
customers
prior
to
that
time,
and
that
is
all
that
congress
meant
to
ratify.
the
division
congress
made
in
the
glass-steagall
act
was
between
investment
banking
activities
that
carry
a
tremendous
risk
of
loss
if
the
market
shifts.
it
did
not
intend
to
illuminate
the
rather
minimal
potential
for
liability,
or
was
not
worried
about
the
potential...
minimal
potential
liability
of
a
broker
having
to
cover
for
a
customer
who
happens
to
place
an
order.
it
may
be,
as
petitioner
suggested
today,
that
brokerage
firms
place
their
entire
assets
at
their
disposal
when
they
execute
an
order,
but
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
less
than
1
percent
of
all
of
the
transactions
executed
by
the
schwab
brokerage
firm...
less
than
1
percent
involves
situations
where
the
customer
fails
to
satisfy
his
own
order
or
his
own
request.
accordingly,
this
is
not
a
significant
problem,
and
it
is
certainly
not
a
problem
congress
made
any
specific
reference
in
anything
in
1933
or
1935.
congress
could
not
foresee
in
1933
the
discount
brokerage
activities
would
some
day
be
profitable.
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
from
the
language
that
it
adopted,
allowing
for
agency
actions
on
the
part
of
bank
in
executing...
in
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
that
it
would
clearly
have
upheld
and
permitted
the
banks
to
engage
in
the
kinds
of
activities
that
schwab
undertakes
here.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
interpretation,
as
i
just
mentioned
to
justice
white,
is
a
reasonable
one,
and
that
is
where
this
court's
inquiry
should
stop.
so
long
as
the
comptroller's
newest
interpretation
is
reasonable,
it
is
entitled
to
deference
by
this
court.
petitioner
conjures
up
the
horrors
of
the
bank
failures
of
the
1930s
and
hints
that
the
board's
decision
here
is
based
on
arguments
presented
in
connection
with
the
regulatory
and
legislative
decisions
of
the
mid-1920s
that
led
to
that
financial
disaster.
but
the
federal
reserve
board
has
not
turned
the
clock
back
to
1927,
nor
created
an
environment
of
serious
bank
failure.
the
board
has
instead
adjusted
to
the
financial
events
of
the
1970s
and
the
1980s,
and
acting
faithfully
to
the
congressional
scheme
created
to
allow
substantial,
but
not
unbridled,
expansion
of
the
business
of
banking.
it
has
presented
a
thorough
and
reasonable
explanation
for
its
approval
of
bankamerica's
application
in
this
case.
it
is
petitioner
and
the
securities
firms
whom
it
represents
who
seek
to
stop
the
financial
clock
from
moving
beyond
the
events
of
the
1970s,
when
that
industry
as
so
structured
that
competition
was
severely
limited,
and
the
only
role
for
a
bank
on
the
exchanges
was
to
serve
as
an
intermediary
between
the
bank's
customer
and
the
broker,
with
the
latter
receiving
the
fee,
but
without
any
risk
of
competition.
those
times
are
gone,
and
the
securities
industry
must
recognize
that
banks,
and
of
particular
significance
to
this
case,
bank
holding
companies
and
their
affiliates
are
legitimate
competitors
in
that
discrete
area
of
securities
activity
concerning
the
purchase
and
sale
of
stock
as
agent.
this
change
is
not
the
product
of
regulatory
fiat,
but
rather
a
reasonable
application
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutes
congress
adopted,
and
empowered
the
board
to
use
its
expertise
to
enforce.
it
is,
therefore,
not
the
board's
action
that
"should
be
legislated
by
congress",
as
petitioner
puts
it,
but
rather
petitioner's
efforts
to
overturn
the
orderly
decision
of
the
board
that
should
be
submitted
to
congress
for
reevaluation.
the
administrative
law
judge,
the
federal
reserve
board,
and
the
second
circuit
have
all
unanimously
and
correctly
held
that
the
discount
brokerage
activities
are
a
legitimate
part
of
the
business
of
banking,
which
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
by
glass-steagall.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
