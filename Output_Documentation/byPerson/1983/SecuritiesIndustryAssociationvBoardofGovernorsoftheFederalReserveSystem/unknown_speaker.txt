unknown
speaker
had
the
board
ever
expressly
forbidden
such
a
thing
before?
unknown
speaker
and
because
no
one
has
ever
asked
them
before?
unknown
speaker
or
even
asked
to
be
permitted
to?
unknown
speaker
were
banks
even
doing
that
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
glass-steagall
act?
i
kind
of
sensed
in
reading
the
briefs
that
the
glass-steagall
act
was
not
directed
in
its
terms
to
that
practice,
and
i
wondered
if
banks
say
in
the
twenties,
before
the
glass-steagall
act
was
passed,
actually
were
doing
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pitt,
you
agree
with
the
government
that
commercial
paper
is
not
an
investment
security
as
that
term
is
used
in
section
16?
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree,
then,
with
judge
wilkie's
opinion's
reading
of
the
word
21?
unknown
speaker
this
is
his
functional
analysis?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pitt,
very
naturally
you're
emphasizing
the
language
that's
found
in
section
21,
rather
than
the
language
in
section
16.
in
your
view,
is
section
16
totally
redundant?
unknown
speaker
well,
16
doesn't
refer
to
notes?
unknown
speaker
16
doesn't
refer
to
notes,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
suggest
that
the
word
"notes"
doesn't
include
commercial
paper.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
doesn't
include
the
kind
of
notes
represented
by
commercial
paper?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
that
really
sounds
amazingly
simple,
clear
as
a
bell,
and
i
just
can't
understand
why
it
took
bright
bank
lawyers
so
many
years
to
discover
that
glass-steagall
sections
25
or
21
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this.
unknown
speaker
but
they
haven't
been
underwriting?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
other
bank
had
the
nerve
to
start
underwriting
until
this
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know.
but
don't
you
suppose
that
if
the
understanding
was
that
banks
could
underwrite
commercial
paper
they
would
have
been
doing
it
all
this
time?
unknown
speaker
you
sound
pretty
good.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
claiborne--
unknown
speaker
--no,
you
go
ahead
and
finish
with
justice
powell.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
was
not
non-recourse,
or
suppose
that
the
bank
did
undertake
what
underwriters
frequently
do,
some
obligation
to
buy
what
wasn't
sold.
i
would
think
your
position
would
still
be
that
glass-steagall
had
nothing
to
do
with
that;
if
the
bank
couldn't
do
that,
it
would
be
for
some
other
reason?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
even
that
glass-steagall
would
not
prevent
a
bank
from
underwriting
and
having
an
obligation
to
buy
whatever
wasn't
sold?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think,
mr.
claiborne,
that
if
the
board
had
construed
it
the
other
way,
that
the
banks
couldn't
do
this,
that
they
would
have
been
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
that
there's
only
one
way
the
statute
can
be
read
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
deference;
it's
just
a
question
of
reading
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
your
statutory
construction
argument
it
seems
to
me
wouldn't
leave
any
room
for
the
board
to
go
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
you...
do
you
think
that
your
position
on
the
statute
is
consistent
with
what
the
board
thinks
the
statute
means?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
board
would
have
thought
it
could
go
either
way
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
it
still
would
have
been
permissible
in
their
view
to
go
the
other
way,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
claiborne,
one
other
question,
and
i
hope
it
is
in
proper
bounds.
has
this
position
had
an
impact
on
the
enforcement
of
other
laws,
like
the
securities
laws?
has
this
construction
by
the
board,
has
it
had
an
impact,
for
example,
on
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
their
regulation?
unknown
speaker
did
the
sec
let
its
views
be
known
before
the
board?
unknown
speaker
are
those
views
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
and
did
they
take
a
position
in
the
court
of
appeals?
were
they
allowed
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
probably
didn't
have--
unknown
speaker
--well,
banks,
though,
are
certainly
regularly
going
around
hunting
participants
in
loans
that
are
beyond
their
limits.
unknown
speaker
so
this
is
just
a
loan
in
which
the
originating
bank
doesn't
have
a
part.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
disagree.
unknown
speaker
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
unknown
speaker
would
you
comment
on
mr.
claiborne's
observation
as
to
the
position
taken
by
the
three
regulatory
bank
agencies
over
the
years?
unknown
speaker
how
can
it
be
unprecedented
if
you
reverse
something?
unknown
speaker
although
it
is
for
customers.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
is
for
customers
of
the
bank.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
under
the
new
proposed
regulation
that
the
activity
considered
here
would
be
made
invalid?
unknown
speaker
this
case
involves
a
separate
subsidiary,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
so
the
new
regulation
would
not
counteract
this
particular
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
we
were
dealing
here
with
a
bank
affiliate,
not
the
bank
itself.
i
also
thought
that
the
prohibition
in
section
16,
on
its
face,
applied
to
banks
and
not
the
affiliates.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
same
inquiry
under
the
bank
holding
company
act?
unknown
speaker
what
did
you
just
say?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
supposed
to
engage
in
non-banking
activities,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
activity
that
a
bank
ever
engaged
in?
unknown
speaker
neither
did
the
comptroller.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
they
have
often
acted
exactly
like
a
broker?
unknown
speaker
what
about
with
the
same
legal
effect?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
they
have
always...
you
don't
think
that
they
have
always
submitted
them
to
a
broker?
unknown
speaker
they
won't
have
to
now,
will
they?
unknown
speaker
that
is
somewhat
of
a
change,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
our
inquiry
would
be
whether
what
the
board
did
is
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
to
do
by
the
relevant
statutes.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
board
could
authorize
a
bank
to
engage
in
underwriting,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
the
argument
right
here
is
that
congress
didn't
intend
a
bank
to
engage
in
brokering.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
are
you
aware
of
any
bank,
other
than
j.
p.
morgan,
which
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
actually
had
a
seat
on
the
exchange
and
kept
it?
unknown
speaker
six.
unknown
speaker
did
they
continue
to
keep
their
seats,
other
than
morgan,
and
use
them
to
execute
orders
for
customers?
unknown
speaker
and
were
not
challenged
under
section
16
by
the
comptroller,
or
anyone
else
for
executing
orders?
unknown
speaker
under
the
comptroller's
ruling,
until
lately,
a
bank
couldn't
do
this
itself,
could
it?
unknown
speaker
that
ruling
was
rather
old,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
did
the
comptroller
overturn
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
when
did
he
specifically
overturn
that
prior
ruling?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
need
to
admit
that
he
was
wrong,
in
the
first
place,
it
is
just
that
either
his
prior
ruling...
either
one
of
them,
his
prior
ruling
or
this
one,
were
correct.
unknown
speaker
what
year
did
you
mention?
unknown
speaker
haven't
a
lot
of
financial
arrangements
changed?
unknown
speaker
since
then,
in
the
'40.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
sec's
position
now
on
this?
unknown
speaker
on
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that
it
was
just
a
little
turf
gathering
that
they
supported
this
application
before--
unknown
speaker
--what
will
happen
is
that
they
will
have
many
more
applications
for
licenses.
unknown
speaker
did
they
there
say
that
if
this
rule
is
approved,
the
banks
would
have
to
be
licensed?
unknown
speaker
but
they
now
assert
it?
