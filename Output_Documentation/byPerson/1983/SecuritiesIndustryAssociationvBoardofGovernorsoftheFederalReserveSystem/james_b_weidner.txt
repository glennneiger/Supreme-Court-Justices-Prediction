mr.
james
b.
weidner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
admittedly
unprecedented
order
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
reversing
50
years
of
administrative
understanding,
and
industry
understanding
permitting
bank
affiliates,
for
the
first
time
in
half
a
century--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--unprecedented
in
terms
of
reversing
the
understanding,
but
not
unprecedented
in
terms
of
reversing
a
prior
administrative
ruling.
involved
are
two
statutes
fundamental
to
the
governing
of
the
banking
industry,
and
financial
services
industry
in
this
country,
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
the
glass-steagall
act.
in
this
case,
directly
contrary
to
congressional
intent,
in
our
view,
the
board
of
governors,
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit,
turned
two
narrow
exceptions
in
the
statutes
into
broad
authorizations
instead.
we
believe
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
bank
holding
company
act
requires
that
any
bank
affiliate,
which
is
not
a
bank,
be
involved
in
a
business
that
is
so
closely
related
to
banking
as
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
that
has
been
interpreted
and
requires
that
that
business
be
closely
related
in
the
sense
of
being...
of
having
a
direct
and
significant
connection
to
banking,
and
not
similar...
not
simply
being
related
to
it
in
the
sense
of
being
functionally
similar,
which
is
what
the
board
found.
secondly,
we
believe
that
the
glass-steagall
act
prevents
any
affiliation
of
a
bank
with
an
entity
that
is
principally
engaged
in
the
public
securities
business,
and
that
is
the
business
in
which
the
affiliate
here
involved
is
here
involved.
briefly,
the
facts
are
these:
in
early
1982,
the
bankamerica
corporation,
owner
of
bankamerica,
one
of
the
largest
banks
in
the
world,
applied
to
the
federal
reserve
board
for
permission
to
acquire
the
charles
schwab
corporation.
schwab
is
the
owner
of
one
of
the
largest,
if
not
the
largest
discount
brokers
in
the
united
states.
the
sia,
our
client,
opposed
the
application
and
requested
a
hearing.
the
federal
reserve
board
ordered
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge.
the
law
judge
ruled
in
favor
of
the
proposed
acquisition.
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
if
i
may,
let
me
first
address
the
bank
holding
company
act.
that
act
was
passed
in
1956
to
further
the
basic
congressional
purpose
of
separating
banking
from
commerce
in
general.
by
that
act,
congress
said
that
banks
will
not
evade
that
separation
through
the
structure
of
a
bank
holding
company,
and
said
that
a
bank
holding
company
could
not
acquire
a
non-banking
subsidiary
unless...
a
very
narrow
exception...
that
subsidiary's
business
was
so
closely
related
to
the
business
of
banking
to
be
a
proper
incident
thereto.
the
board
of
governors
interpreted
that
statute
for
the
next
decade
as
requiring
a
direct
and
significant
connection
between
the
proposed
activity
of
the
subsidiary
and
the
activity
of
the
bank
holding
company
itself.
in
1969,
the
board
asked
congress
to
amend
the
statute
to
loosen
up
the
standard.
they
found
it
to
be
too
restrictive.
what
they
proposed
was
that
the
closely
related
standard
be
changed
to
read
"functionally
related",
and
that
the
phase
"the
business
of"
be
deleted
from
the
phrase
"closely
related
to
the
business
of
banking.
"
the
house
and
the
senate
both
passed
bills,
which
in
fact
did
substitute
"functionally
related"
for
"closely
related",
but
there
were
significant
differences
between
those
bills.
one
of
the
most
significant
differences
was
that
the
house
said:
we
will
put
functionally
related
in,
but
we
are
also
going
to
have
what
became
known
as
a
laundry
list
of
prohibited
activities
that
in
no
case
will
be
deemed
closely
related
to
banking.
the
result
was
a
conference
committee,
of
course,
and
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
legislative
donnybrook.
clearly
there
was
a
battle
in
the
conference
committee
as
to
which
view
would
prevail.
in
fact,
the
compromise
was
reached
only
after
a
virtual
stalemate.
the
obvious
deal
that
was
cut
was
this:
the
conference
agreed
to
leave
out
"the
business
of"
from
the
"business
of
banking",
but
in
return
for
that,
and
in
return
for
the
house
members
deleting
their
laundry
list
of
prohibited
activities,
the
proposed
functionally
related
test
was
out
and
the
original
"closely
related"
language
was
left
in
the
statute.
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
makes
clear...
it
is
a
little
bit
difficult
to
discern
all
of
the
ramifications
of
what
happened,
but
one
thing,
i
believe,
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
that
congress
did
not
substitute
"functionally
related"
for
"closely
related"
in
the
statute.
the
congressional
report...
the
conference
committee
report
makes
clear
that
the
board
was
given
greater
flexibility
in
the
sense
that
by
deleting
"the
business
of"
from
the
statute,
no
longer
did
a
connection
a
connection
have
to
be
shown
between
the
specific
holding
company
and
the
proposed
activity,
but
that
a
direct
and
significant
connection
continued
to
be
required
between
banking
in
general
and
the
proposed
activity.
that
is
the
connection
that
could
not
be
found
here.
the
specific
business
that
is
at
issue
is
execution
of
securities
trade
for
the
public.
that
is
a
business
that
banks
have
not
been
in
for
the
last
50
years.
it
was
not
on
the
basis
that
banks
generally
have
been
in
the
business
that
the
board
found,
or
could
find
this
acquisition
to
be
permissible.
instead,
the
board
found
it
permissible
because,
in
its
view,
the
activities
involved
here
were
functionally
similar
to
other
activities
performed
by
banks,
so
that
at
least
some
banks
were
well-equipped
to
perform
them.
i
suggest
what
has
happened
is
that
the
board...
this
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
interpretation.
the
board
has
in
fact
put
back
in
the
statute
exactly
the
language
that
the
congress
refused
to
accept.
we
have
a
board,
in
effect,
amendment
of
statute
directly
contrary
to
legislative
intent.
it
is
not
simply
that
it
is
contrary
to
legislative
intent,
but
i
suggest,
if
anything,
"functionally
similar"
is
even
broader
than
"functionally
related".
for
example,
if
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
shown
is
that
the
bank,
or
at
least
some
banks
have
the
capacity
to
perform
some
activity
and,
therefore,
it
is
closely
related.
banks
have
the
capacity
and
do
execute
wire
transfers.
then
why
couldn't
it
be
argued
that
they
should
be
able
to
go
into
the
telecommunications
business,
and
that
is
not
a
farfetched
example.
the
american
bankers
association...
this
is
in
our
brief...
has
in
fact
asked
the
federal
reserve
board
to
approve,
as
a
bank
affiliate
activity,
telecommunication
services.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
next
thing
we
are
going
to
hear
is
that
because
banks
have
dispensed
toaster
and
calculators
to
get
depositors
to
put
money
in
the
bank,
then
they
can
go
into
the
retail
toaster
business.
in
a
more
serious
vein,
i
really
do
believe
that
this
is
virtually
a
limitless
standard.
the
board
has
pointed
to
this
court's
decision
in
what
we
have
called
ici-2
as
authority
for
its
standard.
but
the
fact
it,
the
activity
involved
there,
investment
advice
to
a
closed
and
mutual
fund,
was
an
activity
that
banks
had
done
for
50
years.
indeed,
this
court
specifically
said
that
in
looking
at
future
applications,
the
board
was
to
assure
that
the
bank
affiliate
did
not
exceed
bank's
traditional
fiduciary
functions.
in
this
case,
however,
there
is
no
doubt
that
securities
execution
is
not
a
traditional
banking
function.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
i
am
sorry.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
securities
execution?
mr.
james
b.
weidner
no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
to
the
extent
that
banks
have
had
an
involvement
in
"brokerage"
over
the
years,
their
involvement
has
simply
been
to
accommodate
orders
of
bank
customers
to
sell
stock
or
securities.
but
in
doing
that,
they
have
uniformly
forwarded
the
orders
to
brokers
for
execution.
there
is
a
significant
difference
here
because
a
broker
who
executes
a
trade
puts
his
net
capital
on
the
line
every
time
he
does
that.
in
other
words,
whether
it
is
one
time
a
day
or
100,000
times
a
day,
each
time
that
trade
executed
that
broker
has
got
to
come
up
with
the
securities
or
cash
to
make
good
in
the
trade.
if
his
customer
doesn't
have
it,
the
broker
has
got
to
come
up
with
the
money
or
the
securities.
it
is
for
that
reason...
turning
to
glass-steagall
just
for
a
moment,
because
i
think
it
does
respond
to
your
question,
although
it
is
not
in
the
bank
holding
company
act.
the
glass-steagall
act
was
amended,
and
i
will
return
to
this,
to
limit
bank
securities
activities
to
purchasing
and
selling,
without
recourse
upon
the
order
and
for
the
account
of
customers.
the
question
is
what
does
"without
recourse"
mean?
this
court
addressed...
in
its
technical
sense,
it
means
without
endorsement
or
guarantee.
but
this
court
addressed
that
specific
requirement
in
the
awotin
case,
and
expressly
flatly
held
that
without
recourse,
in
this
context,
in
this
statute,
its
predecessor,
is
not
limited
solely
to
endorsement
and
guarantee
because
it
would
make
any
sense
in
terms
of
trading
and
securities,
which
are
not
typically
endorsed
or
guaranteed.
certainly
stock
is
not
endorsed
or
guaranteed.
it
said
it
had
a
broader
meaning.
then
the
question
is,
what
is
the
analogous
liability
that
a
broker
might
face
to
a
third
party,
if
it
is
not
endorsement
or
guarantee?
the
analogous
liability
is
exactly
the
risk
of
customer
fails.
the
broker
has
got
to
come
up
with
the
securities
or
stock
to
the
third
person
if
his
customer
doesn't.
it
is
exactly
that
kind
of
liability
which
we
believe
congress
expressly
legislated
against
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
way
that
a
bank
or
a
broker
can
accomplish
avoiding
that
liability,
and
many
brokers
do,
is
acting
as
a
forwarding
broker,
that
is
to
say,
the
broker
gets
a
securities
order,
forwards
it
to
an
executing
broker
on
a
so-called
fully
disclosed
basis...
that
is
disclosing
the
name
of
the
customer
to
the
executing
broker...
who
then
deals
directly
with
the
customer,
account
statements,
confirmations,
and
the
like.
there
is
no
recourse
against
the
bank.
in
fact,
i
should
point
out...
this
is
something
that
has
happened
since
our
reply
brief
was
filed
on
the
same
day...
the
comptroller
of
currency,
in
a
proposed
rulemaking
reported
at
49
federal
register
15089,
has
proposed
regulations
to
deal
with
bank
securities
activities.
one
of
the
things
that
the
comptroller
said
in
that
regulation
a
week
ago
was
that
no
bank
will
conduct
a
securities
business
in-house,
except
on
a
fully
disclosed
basis,
that
is
to
say,
forwarding
the
orders
to
brokers
for
execution,
which
is
what
banks
have
done
on
an
incidental
accommodation
basis
for
years,
and
that,
i
suggest,
is
what
the
comptroller
understands
"without
recourse"
means
in
the
statute.
to
return
to
where
we
started,
no,
i
don't
believe
that
banks
have
been
in
the
business
of
executing
securities
orders
for
the
public
at
any
point
until
they
were
allowed
to
be
affiliated
with
schwab
only
two
years
ago.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
it
could
be
performed,
but
only
in
a
separate
subsidiary.
the
bank
itself
could
not
perform
it,
that
is
correct.
if
i
may
turn--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--this
clearly
does
involve
a
separate
subsidiary,
that
is
right,
but
in
terms
of
viewing--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--no,
it
would
not,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
it
would.
if
i
did,
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to.
it
had
direct
relevance
because
a
question,
turning
now
to
the
glass-steagall
act,
is
exactly
what
did
congress
mean
to
prohibit
in
that
act.
in
our
view,
without
going
to
the
background
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
of
course,
it
was
a
reaction
to
the
crash
of
'29
and
the
economic
chaos
and
bank
failures
that
followed.
in
our
view,
congress
meant
to
prevent
banks
from
doing
certain
securities
activities
entirely,
and
from
affiliating
with
entities
who
are
principally
in
those
securities
activities.
the
question,
then,
is
what
were
banks
prevented
from
doing
and
how
does
that
relate
to
their
affiliates.
perhaps
i
could
step
back
just
brief
to
1927,
because
the
story
really
start
there
with
the
mcfadden
act.
in
1927,
congress
passed
the
mcfadden
act,
which
for
the
first
time
authorized
banks
to
deal
in
securities.
significantly,
it
authorized
banks
to
deal
only
in
investment
securities,
that
is;
low
risk
debt
securities.
at
no
point
had
congress
authorized
banks
to
deal
in
stock.
the
only
thing
that
banks
were
doing
at
that
time
was,
on
an
informal
basis,
accommodating
customers
who
may
have
inherited
some
stock,
or
whatever,
by
passing
along
those
orders
to
a
broker
for
execution.
by
1933,
after
the
chaos
had
occurred,
congress,
in
effect,
realized
that
it
had
made
a
mistake,
and
in
the
glass-steagall
act
withdrew
the
securities
powers
that
it
had
granted
in
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927,
and
said
that
banks
shall
not
deal
in
investment
securities,
except
to
the
limited
extent
of
purchasing
and
selling,
without
recourse,
upon
the
order
and
for
the
account
of
their
customers.
i
won't
return
to
"without
recourse",
but
it
seems
to
us
from
the
face
of
it
that
it
is
clear
that
that
language
meant
that
a
customer...
that
a
bank
was
merely
to
pass
a
customer's
orders
along
for
execution.
but
there
really
can't
be
much
doubt
about
what
was
done,
in
our
view,
because
immediately
after
the
glass-steagall
act
passed,
the
comptroller
of
currency,
who
is
responsible,
of
course,
for
all
national
banks,
said:
look,
wait
a
minute.
i
think
that
you
may
have
gone
too
far,
because
if
you
read
that
proviso,
the
exception
to
dealing
literally,
it
says
that
a
bank
may
accommodate
only
orders
in
investment
securities,
not
stock,
and
said
the
comptroller,
that
is
pretty
important
in
rural
areas
where
a
bank
may
be
the
only
financial
institution
in
miles.
there
isn't
a
brokerage
house
on
the
corner.
won't
you
clarify
your
intent,
in
effect,
he
said,
and
make
it
clear
that
banks
can
continue
to
accommodate
on
this
informal
basis
orders
and
stock,
as
well.
he
proposed
legislation.
in
1934,
both
the
house
and
senate
passed
bills
that
incorporated
it,
but
it
floundered
on
the
last
day
of
the
session.
the
comptroller
then
issued
a
rulemaking
interpretation
that
said,
in
effect,
in
my
view
congress
didn't
mean
to
prevent
accommodating
orders
on
stock.
i
am
going
to
permit
it
and
return
to
congress,
in
effect,
next
year
to
get
it
expressly
permitted.
but,
said
the
comptroller
in
that
ruling,
this
does
not
mean
banks
may
do
a
brokerage
business.
that
was
in
july
1934.
in
august,
i
believe
it
was,
or
september
1934,
the
federal
reserve
board
ruled
similarly
and
specifically
quoted
the
comptroller's
language.
in
1934,
the
comptroller
did
return
to
congress,
testified
that
in
his
view
this
was
necessary
to
expand
this
exception,
and
made
clear
that
it
was
only
on
an
accommodation
basis,
and
convinced
congress
to
expand
the
statute
to
include
purchasing
and
selling,
without
recourse,
on
the
orders,
securities
and
stock.
under
this
court's
precedent,
in
zuber
against
allen,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
history
itself
should
be
controlling,
if
there
were
ambiguity,
we
don't
think
there
is,
as
to
what
congress
intended
in
the
exception
in
section
16
for
accommodating
stock
orders.
the
comptroller
proposed
the
legislation.
he
testified
directly
before
the
congressional
committees
that
were
considering
it,
what
his
view
was,
and
congress
enacted
what
he
proposed.
the
respondents
say,
wait
a
minute,
in
1933,
the
congressional
reports
that
accompanied
the
initial
glass-steagall
act
said,
"banks
shall
be
permitted,
to
the
same
extent
heretofore,
to
deal
in
securities.
"
therefore
that
shows
that
they
were
permitted
to
be
public
stockbrokers.
but
let's
look
at
what
happened.
banks
had
not
been
permitted
prior
to
1933
to
broker
stock,
or
prior
to
any
date
to
broker
stock.
they
had
been
permitted
only
to
deal
in
investment
securities.
the
comptroller
made
that
clear,
he
made
clear
what
he
had
in
mind,
that
is
an
accommodation
provision
limitation
during
1934
and
1935.
the
35
amendment
that
added
stock...
expanded
the
exception
to
add
stock,
was
specifically
characterized
as
a
technical
amendment
intended
to
make
no
substantive
changes
in
the
law.
if
respondents
are
correct
that
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
permit
banks
to
be
public
stock
brokers,
it
would
necessarily
mean
that
in
1935,
when
congress
passed
a
technical,
non-substantive
amendment
to
a
statute,
the
glass-steagall
act,
otherwise
meant
broadly
to
prohibit
securities
activities
for
banks,
it
authorized,
for
the
only
time
in
200
years,
banks
to
become
public
stockbrokers.
i
suggest
that
simply
doesn't
make
common
sense,
let
alone
legislative
history
sense.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
justice
o'connor,
we
clearly
are
dealing
with
a
bank
affiliate,
and
let
me
turn
to
section
20,
which
deals
specifically
with
them.
let
me
say
this
that
in
our
view
the
structure
and
the
history
of
the
glass-steagall
make
it
clear
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was,
given...
remember
that
when
this
was
passed,
given
the
crash
and
the
2,000
banks
that
failed
in
the
interim,
to
get
banks
out
of
the
securities
business,
and
it
did
it
by
prohibiting
certain
activities
entirely
for
banks,
and
prohibiting
them
principally
for
their
affiliates.
there
is
no
history,
although
this
is
in
effect
what
we
believe
the
board
and
the
second
circuit
have
held,
no
history,
legislative
or
statutory,
that
suggests
that
the
board
has
discretion
to
authorize
bank
affiliates
to
engage
principally
in
what
banks
can't
engage
in
at
all.
that
we
believe
is
what
has
happened.
i
might
contrast
section
20
with
section
32
that
has
to
do
with
interlocks.
section
20
has
to
do
with
bank
affiliations.
section
32
did
vest
the
board
with
exemptive
authority
over
certain
circumstances.
let
me
turn
to
section
20.
as
i
said,
that
statute...
that
section
has
to
do
with
bank
affiliations,
part
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
and
provides
that
a
bank
may
not
be
affiliated
with
any
entity
"engaged
principally
in
the
issue,
floatation,
underwriting,
public
sale,
distribution.
"
and
so
on.
i
will
come
back
to
the
language.
in
our
view,
that
language
covers
the
waterfront
in
terms
of
activities,
including
public
brokerage.
it
says,
"public
sale".
it
is
a
remedial
statute.
the
statute
should
be
construed
broadly,
and
indeed
every
time
this
court
has
assessed
the
glass-steagall
act,
it
has
said
that
its
provisions
are
indeed
to
be
read
as
remedial
provisions,
broadly.
what
the
government...
the
respondents
say
is,
now
wait,
public
brokerage
wasn't
covered
by
that
because...
let
me
turn
to
the
second
circuit
first.
the
second
circuit
said,
it
is
not
covered
because
the
terms
apply
only
to
principal
activities,
as
opposed
to
agency
activities.
underwriting,
for
example,
they
said,
is
a
principal
activity,
and
so
on,
so
brokerage
is
out.
but
the
fact
is
that
underwriting
certainly
encompasses,
and
the
board
doesn't
dispute,
best
effort
underwriting.
that
is
an
agency,
not
a
principal
activity.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
a
public
sale
couldn't
equally
well
be
an
agency
as
well
as
a
principal
activity.
the
board,
apparently
recognizing
the
problem
in
the
second
circuit
opinion
in
that
respect,
doesn't
support
it
here.
they
have
a
different
view.
their
view
is
that
those
terms
concern
themselves
only
with
new
issues
of
stock
or
the
introduction
of
large
blocks
of
stock
to
the
public.
in
other
words,
public
offerings.
the
problem
with
that
interpretation
is
what
they
are
saying
in
essence
is
that
it
covers
only
primary
distributions
of
stock...
the
first
time
stock
is
made
available
to
the
public.
if
that
is
the
case,
they
have
just
eliminated
half
of
the
securities
industry
from
the
statute.
the
entire
secondary
market
where
stocks
are
traded
once
they
are
out
in
public
hands.
if
that
is
the
case,
and
that
is
necessarily
what
they
are
saying,
that
means
not
only
could
bank
affiliates
principally
be
stockbrokers,
but
they
could
be
dealers,
that
is,
trading
for
their
own
account.
they
can
even
be
market-makers.
even
the
federal
reserve
board
has
said
in
its
amended
reg
y
that
dealing
is
not
a
permitted
activity.
one
further
thing,
i
think,
bears
upon
section
20
to
contrast
it
with
section
32,
the
interlock
provision,
which
as
of
1935
used
the
same
phrase
as
section
20.
its
predecessor
language...
the
predecessor
in
'32
as
enacted
in
1933...
said,
purchasing,
selling,
and
negotiating,
not
issuance,
floatation,
and
so
on.
that
amendment
was
also
a
technical,
non-substantive
amendment.
if,
as
the
board
says,
the
statutory
phrase
now
means
only
underwriting,
then
necessarily
section
32
must
have
meant
the
same
thing
in
1933
when
it
was
initially
passed.
then
the
statute
falls
apart,
because
section
16,
which
we
talked
about
before
relating
to
agency
activities,
uses
the
terms
"purchasing
and
selling",
clearly
relating
to
agency
activity.
in
other
words,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
there
is
only
one
construction
that
makes
sense
and
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
the
general
congressional
intent
as
well,
that
is,
and
if
i
may
let
me
read
section
20
in
its
entirety,
"may
not
affiliate
with
an
entity
principally
engaged
in
the
issue,
floatation,
underwriting,
public
sale,
or
distribution
at
wholesale
or
retail,
or
through
syndicate
participation
of
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
or
other
securities.
"
i
suggest
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
covering
the
waterfront.
it
meant
to
prevent
principal
engaging
at
all
activities,
whether
they
are
principal
or
agent,
in
all
markets,
whether
primary
or
secondary,
and
in
all
securities,
whether
they
are
equity
or
debt.
i
think
any
other
construction
of
that
statutory
phrase
throws
this
language
out
of
kilter
and,
i
respectfully
suggest,
congressional
intent
out
the
window.
in
summary,
we
believe
that
the
federal
reserve
board,
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit,
was
incorrect.
schwab
is
unquestionably
principally
engaged
in
the
execution
of
securities
trades
for
the
public,
the
public
securities
brokerage
business.
they
have
reached
that
conclusion
by
turning
very
narrow
exceptions,
"closely
related"
in
the
bank
holding
company
act,
"purchase
and
sale"
in
the
glass-steagall
act,
into
broad
authorizations
instead,
never
intended
by
congress.
in
effect,
they
are
trying
to
turn
the
clock
back
to
1927,
when
congress
had
permitted...
even
further,
to
permit
dealings
in
stock.
i
suggest
that
if
the
legislative
clock
is
to
be
turned
back,
that
is
a
policy
decision
of
enormous
consequences
that
should
be
addressed
by
congress
only,
and
in
fact
congress
is
right
now
looking
in
an
omnibus
fashion
to
the
financial
services
industry
to
see
if
and,
if
so,
how
that
industry
should
be
restructured.
i
believe
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
if
i
may,
several
brief
points.
justice
o'connor,
if
i
could
respond
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
morgan
bank
and
brown
brothers
harriman.
so
far
as
we
know,
there
are...
there
were
two
banks
that
were
on
the
exchange,
and
two
kept
their
seats,
but
i
don't
think
we
can
draw
from
that
an
inference
that
it
was
proper.
first
of
all,
remember
the
comptroller
specifically
prohibited
them
from
engaging
in
public
securities
brokerage,
so
it
is
unlikely
that
they
did.
second,
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
did.
third,
there
is
a
perfectly
good
economic
reason
why
they
would
have
retained
their
seats,
even
though
they
couldn't
be
public
securities
brokers,
simply
this,
there
are
a
lot
of
floor
traders,
or
there
were
a
lot
of
floor
traders
who
had
an
exchange
seat
simply
because
when
there
were
fixed
commissions,
if
they
traded
on
the
floor
themselves,
they
didn't
have
to
pay
any
commission.
if,
as
an
exchange
member,
they
used
the
privilege
of
using
a
floor
broker
there,
you
only
have
pay
10
percent
of
the
commission.
so
that,
for
example,
for
trust
accounts
and
the
like,
it
would
make
eminently
good
sense
for
brown
brothers
to
have
someone
stay
on
the
exchange
when
they
weren't
engaged
in
the
public
brokering
of
securities.
let
me
turn
then
briefly
to
the
comptroller's
recent
interpretation
or
reinterpretation.
i
suggest
that
any
indication
that
the
comptroller
thought,
in
1934
and
1935,
he
was
convincing
congress
to
allow
banks
to
become
public
stock
brokers,
just
is
simply
illogical.
if
it
is
true
that
it
was
important
that
banks,
like
all
other
corporations,
couldn't
be
exchange
members,
only
partnerships
could
be
to
avoid
limited
liability,
then
why
was
the
comptroller
trying
to
convince
congress
to
allow
banks
to
become
public
stock
brokers
when
they
couldn't
do
it?
well,
maybe
it
was
because
he
wanted
them
to
trade
in
the
over-the-counter
market
where
they
don't
have
to
be
exchange
members.
if
that
was
his
motive,
then
why
did
he
issue
a
regulation
immediately
after
the
statute
was
amended
specifically
prohibiting
them
from
being
public
stock
brokers.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
moreover,
something
that
i
didn't
mention,
but
i
think
bears
mention,
is
in
1934
congress
was
considering
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
to
govern
public
stock
brokers.
they
excepted
banks
from
the
definition
of
broker
in
the
'34
act.
why
would
they
do
that
if
they
thought
banks
could
be
public
stockbrokers?
mr.
james
b.
weidner
1934,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
since
then?
mr.
james
b.
weidner
they
have
indeed.
although
in
this
area,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
restated
its
views
only
within
the
last
six
months
that
in
its
view,
and
in
our
view,
the
legislative
history
supports
it,
as
they
believe
it
has,
banks
were
excluded
from
the
brokerage
definition
in
the
'34
act
because
congress
understood
that
they
could
not
engage
in
public
stock
brokerage
because
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
that
they
cannot.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
excuse
me.
that
because
they
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
banking
laws,
they
can't
very
handily
change
the
banking
laws.
but
they
have
proposed
a
rule
that
would
require
banks
that
publicly
solicit
a
brokerage
business
to
register
as
brokers,
because
in
their
view
the
exception
in
the
statute
was
never
meant
to
permit
banks
to
be
the
only
brokers
that
were
unregulated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
justice
white,
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
mention.
i
must
say
that
to
say
the
sec
supported
this
application
is
taking
a
fairly
wide
literary
liberty.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
it
is
certainly
true
that
they
did
not
oppose
it,
but
they...
their
submission
was
in
about
as
hedged
language
as
it
could
be.
it
said
something
to
the
effect,
and
this
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
appeal
in
the
second
circuit,
while
the
spirit,
if
not
the
letter
of
section
20
would
appear
to
prohibit
the
banks
becoming
brokers,
nevertheless
that
is
something
over
which
the
federal
reserve
board
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
no,
justice
white,
they
didn't,
but
i
think--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--they
do.
i
think
it
is
helpful
to
recall
that
when
this
proceeding
started
at
the
beginning
of
1982
there
was
no
bank
in
the
public
securities
brokerage
business.
by
the
end
of
1982,
every
banking
authority
or
financial
institutions
authority
in
the
country
authorized
their
institutions
to
go
in
the
business.
things
have
changed
enormously
in
the
last
two
years.
the
sec
is
trying
to
do
what
it
can,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
underscores
why
a
policy
decision
of
this
sort
should
not
be
done
by
piecemeal
administration.
what
has
happened
is,
you
have
the
federal
reserve
board
act,
now
the
sec
has
got
to
react
to
propose
regulations,
and
then
we
have
the
comptroller
reacting
to
the
sec's
reaction.
it
is
a
game
of
administrative
billiards,
where
the
next
"carem"
shot
is
going
to
come
from.
i'm
quite
serious.
this
is
a
policy
decision
of
enormous
significance,
and
what
we
have
seen
happen
is
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen
as
administrators
preempt
what
should
be
a
congressional
and
was
a
congressional
judgment,
and
try
to
change
the
congressional
intent.
with
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed.
