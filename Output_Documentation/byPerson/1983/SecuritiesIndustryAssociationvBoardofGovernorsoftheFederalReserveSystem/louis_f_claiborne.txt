mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
all
those
of
us
who
have
persevered
through
the
several
briefs
filed
on
both
sides
and
by
the
allies
of
petitioners
and
respondents
must
come
away
with
the
sense
that
two
quite
different
statutes
are
being
discussed,
both
purporting
to
be
the
glass-steagall
act.
the
one
that
is
pictured
by
petitioners
and
their
allies
is
an
uncompromising
ban
on
the
marketing
of
anything
by
commercial
banks.
all
the
emphasis
in
their
briefs
is
on
the
activity
or
the
transaction
which
the
act
prohibits,
with
no
attention
to
the
character
of
the
instrument
that
is
being
dealt
with.
but
unsurprisingly,
the
glass-steagall
act
is
not
quite
that
simple.
to
be
sure,
sometimes
the
prohibitions
of
the
act
do
turn
on
the
kind
of
business
activity
involved.
for
instance,
where
stock
is
the
security
in
question,
banks
may
act
as
brokers
for
their
customers,
but
they
may
not
purchase
stock,
shares
of
stock,
for
their
own
account.
that
indeed
is
the
difference,
as
we
read
it,
between
the
two
most
relevant
decisions
of
this
court,
ici
i
and
ici
ii,
as
they're
referred
to.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
but
on
the
other
hand,
as
often,
the
prohibitions
of
the
act
depend
on
the
character
of
the
instrument,
and
the
most
obvious
example
is
shown
in
the
provision
which
exempts
government
bonds
and
government
insured
bonds
from
any
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
act.
they
may
be
underwritten,
they
may
be
sold,
they
may
be
distributed,
they
may
be
purchased
without
limit
by
a
commercial
bank.
not
so
with
respect
to
bonds
not
issued
by
government
or
not
insured
by
government.
the
short
of
it
is
that
there
is
no
universal
prohibition
in
the
glass-steagall
act
against
underwriting
or
marketing.
it
depends
on
what
sort
of
instrument
is
at
stake.
the
question
here
as
we
view
it
is
whether
commercial
paper
is
wholly
outside
the
prohibitions
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
we
do
not
claim
an
exception,
an
exemption
in
the
act.
our
straightforward
position
is,
the
glass-steagall
act
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
commercial
paper.
it
was
not
intended
to.
so
far
as
the
glass-steagall
act
is
concerned,
commercial
paper
can
be
bought,
sold,
underwritten,
marketed,
framed,
used
for
kindling,
absolutely
indifferent
to
the
act.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
and
because
the
word
"notes"--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
doesn't
include
the
kind
of
notes
represented
by
commercial
paper
any
more
than
it
includes
the
kind
of
notes
represented
by
bankers
acceptances
or
certificates
of
deposit.
as
i
say,
the
act
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
o'connor,
when
i
say
commercial
paper
is
not
covered
i
focus
on
the
kind
of
commercial
paper
issued
in
very
large
denominations,
not
to
the
public
but
to
sophisticated
buyers,
and
for
very
short
term,
which
is
involved
in
this
case--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--and
which
is
the
only
kind
of
commercial
paper
that
banks,
that
any
bank
has
sought
to
deal
in.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
may,
and
it
may
be
that
the
guidelines
which
the
board
has
issued
in
this
case,
which
are
not
guidelines
issued
under
the
glass-steagall
act...
those
are
guidelines
issued
under
the
power
of
the
federal
reserve
board
to
assure
against
unsafe
and
unsound
banking
practices.
those
guidelines,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
last
footnote
of
its
opinion,
are
not
limitations
under
the
glass-steagall
act,
but
they
are
assurances
that,
since
the
board
invoking
other
authority
will
not
permit
banks
to
go
beyond
the
kind
of
dealing
involved
here,
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
glass-steagall
act
of
its
own
would
indeed
prohibit
some
different
kind
of
dealing
in
some
different
kind
of
commercial
paper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
no,
the
word
21
must
mean
the
same
thing.
but
if
the
word
21.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
"normal"
is
perhaps
jumping
to
the
conclusion
too
quickly,
justice
rehnquist.
the
word
21
in
a
list
which
includes
bonds
and
debentures
and
stocks.
bonds
and
debentures,
as
we
know,
are
long-term
notes.
the
perhaps
most
natural
way
to
read
section
21
is
to
say
to
oneself,
the
word
"note"
must
include
something
like
a
bond
or
a
debenture,
something
of
relatively
long
term--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i'm
only
suggesting
that
one
of
the
ways
of
construing
an
enumeration
of
words
is
to
define
each
by
the
company
it
keeps,
and
not
to
suppose
that
there's
a
sudden
jump
to
an
entirely
different
sort
of
financial
instrument.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
there
is
this
in
common
between
stocks
and
the
bonds
and
the
debentures:
they
are
all
things
in
which
it
is
customary
to
view
investment
activity,
whereas
short-term
commercial
paper
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
in
which
people
invest.
they
are
not,
also,
offered
to
the
general
public,
unlike
bonds,
debentures
and
stocks,
which
have
that
in
common,
that
there
are
public
offerings.
but
this
is
not
the
only
reason
why
21
ought
not
be
given
the
broad
reading.
section
21,
after
all,
is
not
the
section
addressed
directly
to
banks;
it's
section
16.
and
we
oughtn't
to
read
into
section
21
anything
that
isn't
in
section
16
as
a
prohibition.
indeed,
there's
a
proviso
to
section
21
which
tells
us
precisely
that:
nothing
which
is
permitted
in
section
16
is
prohibited
by
this
section,
notwithstanding,
in
effect,
the
broadness
of
the
terms
as
some
untutored
person
might
read
it.
it
is
natural
to
attempt
to
avoid
a
clash
between
the
two
sections.
now,
when
we
look
at
section
16,
we
cannot
reach
the
conclusion
that
commercial
paper
is
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
that
section,
and
the
demonstration
is
quite
simple.
we
know
that
commercial
paper
is
not
an
investment
security.
we
know
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
but
we
also
know
it
because
those
words
are
derived
from
the
mcfadden
act
and
we
have
the
legislative
history
of
the
mcfadden
act,
in
which
there
is
an
express
exchange
in
which
the
congressman
said,
no,
commercial
paper
is
not
viewed
by
anybody
as
an
investment
security,
and
when
we
are
legislating
about
investment
securities
we
do
not
mean
to
include
commercial
paper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
it
didn't
take
bright
lawyers
so
long
to
come
to
this
conclusion.
the
fact
is
that
banks
had
been
purchasing
commercial
paper
since
long
before
glass-steagall.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that's
a
matter
of
economic
history,
not
a
matter
of
legal
slowness.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
it's
against
their
interests
to
underwrite
when
they
could
earn
more
by
making
the
loan.
underwriting
is
the
least
attractive
activity
for
the
bank,
in
that
it's
merely
getting
an
agent's
fee
instead
of
deriving
the
much
more
substantial
discount
if
it
were
to
make
the
loan
itself.
so
it
was
with
reluctance
that
banks
came
to
acting
as
dealers
in
commercial
paper.
they
much
preferred
being
the
issuer,
the
purchaser,
of
the
commercial
paper.
it's
only
when
those
who
were
issuing
the
commercial
paper
found
that
banks
were
unable
to
provide
them
the
funds
that
they
went
elsewhere,
found
a
market
elsewhere
to
sell
their
paper.
and
banks
gradually,
realizing
that
the
business
had
gone
from
them,
decided
the
next
best
thing
to
do
was
to
attempt
to
get
something
out
of
the
transaction
by
inserting
themselves
as
a
dealer.
but
that
is
a
matter
of
slow
economic
reality,
not
a
matter
of
dull
lawyers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
not
very
good
at
financial
history,
justice
blackmun.
but
my
understanding
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
because
of
regulations
by
the
federal
reserve
board
limiting
the
interest
that
could
be
paid
by
banks,
the
deposits
which
they
had
to
lend
were
limited,
and
accordingly
the
demand
for
funds
had
to
find
a
source
elsewhere
and
did
find
it
elsewhere,
so
the
banks
were
no
longer
the
almost
sole
purchasers
of
the
paper,
but
insurance
companies
and
others
began
lending
on
commercial
paper.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
as
we
view
it,
justice
blackmun,
this
is
not
an
investment
banking
operation.
it
is
an
arrangement
of
a
loan,
something
which
is
proper
for
commercial
banks
to
be
doing,
something
traditionally
which
they
have
done.
it
is
functionally
no
different
than
a
sale
of
a
participation
in
a
loan.
it
is
therefore
an
attempt
to
recapture
some
small
part
of
a
very
traditional
commercial
banking
activity.
now,
in
our
view
there
are
at
least
three
independent
supports
for
the
conclusion
we
draw.
first,
the
literal
passing
of
the
statute
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that,
since
commercial
paper
is
not
an
investment
security,
it
therefore
must
be,
if
covered,
a
security.
and
yet,
we
know
that
commercial
banks
are
forbidden
to
purchase
securities,
except
investment
securities.
and
yet,
we
know
that
commercial
banks
have
and
may
continue
to
purchase
commercial
paper.
therefore,
commercial
paper
cannot
be
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
section
16.
now,
the
answer
given
to
this
seemingly
unanswerable
argument
is
that
the
purchase
of
commercial
paper
is
authorized
by
the
first
portion
of
section
16,
which
is
in
fact
a
holdover
from
the
banking
act
of
1864.
that
is
a
very
awkward
way
to
look
about
it.
it
appears
that
the
glass-steagall
act
was
not
amending
the
banking
act
and
changing
the
traditional
activities
of
banks.
it
was
simply
turning
to
a
wholly
new
subject
and
saying,
as
the
text
suggests,
now
with
respect
to
something
else,
dealing
in
securities,
the
rules
shall
be
the
following.
and
it
appears
that
that
category
of
dealing
in
securities
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
discounting
or
negotiation
of
promissory
notes,
an
activity
which
before
and
since
has
been
authorized
to
banks.
the
legislative
history
of
glass-steagall
again
leads
us
to
the
same
conclusion.
it
is
no
inadvertence
that
the
text
fails
to
deal
with
commercial
paper
dealings,
because
bank
purchases
of
commercial
paper
were
common
long
before
glass-steagall
and
continued
to
be
so
afterwards
and
were
so
at
the
time
it
was
enacted.
congress
had
occasion
to
focus
if
it
wished
to
deal
with
commercial
paper,
but
did
not
do
so.
on
the
contrary,
the
only
mention
of
commercial
paper
in
the
legislative
history
of
glass-steagall
is
a
regret
that
banks
have
abandoned
their
good
old
habits
of
loaning
on
commercial
paper
and
have
turned
to
dealing,
underwriting,
and
otherwise
involving
themselves
with
speculative
securities.
and
it
was
against
that
danger,
which
had
in
the
view
of
congress
caused
the
bank
failures,
that
congress
now
turned
its
face
of
1933.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
powell,
one
can
conceive,
of
course,
of
situations
in
which
a
bank
might--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--it
seems
to
us
that
when
the
bank
is
merely
the
agent
for
the
sale,
with
no
obligation
to
take
up
any
portion
of
the
issue
which
is
unsold,
that
its
involvement
with
the
commercial
paper
is
at
its
minimum,
far
less
than
when
it's
the
purchaser
of
the
commercial
paper
and
then
has
a
real
interest
in
assuring
that
there
isn't
a
default
because
it
will
be
the
loser,
whereas
when
it's
the
agent
someone
else
will
be
the
loser
and
the
reputation
of
the
bank
may
be
marginally
at
stake,
but
at
least
it
will
not
be
its
depositors
who
are
directly
injured.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
this
is...
excuse
me.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
all
this
is
supposing
that
there
is
a
serious
risk
in
dealing
in
commercial
paper,
and
since
the
penn
central
failure
there
has
been
no
significant
failure
in
commercial
paper,
and
indeed
measures
have
been
taken
to
assure
that
that
is
not
so.
commercial
paper
is
the
safest
conceivable
instrument
in
which
to
deal,
safer
than
an
ordinary
commercial
loan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
since--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
is
so.
since
the
bank
can
and
did
and
continues
to
be
able
to
purchase
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
since
it
can
clearly
buy
directly,
it
can
buy
on
condition,
it
can
buy
if
no
one
else
buys.
if
it
can
buy
straightforwardly,
it
can
do
that.
there's
no
reason...
the
other
dangers,
the
more
subtle
hazards
that
were
identified
in
the
first
ici
decision,
are
not
implicated
here.
the
bank's
reputation
for
prudence
and
soundness
is
enhanced,
not
at
stake,
when
it
deals
in
commercial
paper
as
opposed
to
investment
securities.
the
danger
that
the
bank
will
have
to
or
will
be
inclined
to
shore
up
the
companies
whose
commercial
paper
it's
dealing
in
because
it's
tied
its
fortunes
or
its
reputation
to
the
fate
of
that
enterprise
is
not
realistic
here.
because
of
the
absence
of
risk,
there's
less
occasion
to
think
in
terms
of
shoring
up.
and
in
any
event,
because
the
rate
on
commercial
paper
is
lower
than
the
rate
on
commercial
loans,
there
is
no
incentive
to
making...
to
accepting
a
loan
in
order
to
purchase
commercial
paper.
now,
the
danger
of
giving
disinterested
advice
to
customers
of
the
bank,
which
is
one
of
those
conflicts
or
potential
conflicts
that
was
identified
in
the
ici
decision,
is
not
present
here
either.
the
customers
here
are
only
a
limited
category
of
sophisticated
investors
who
are
in
a
position
to
judge
for
themselves
and
do
not
require
the
investment
advice
of
the
bank.
the
general
public
and
the
general
customers
of
the
bank
are
not
potential
buyers
of
commercial
paper.
the
short
of
it
is
that
there
is
no...
none
of
the
risks
identified
by
this
court
as
underlying
the
glass-steagall
act
are
implicated
here,
and
indeed
the
petitioners
cannot
identify
and
have
not
attempted
to
identify
any
such
risks.
they
say
congress
determined
there
was
a
risk.
but
after
all,
that
is
the
whole
issue
in
the
case,
whether
congress
did
in
fact
encompass
commercial
paper.
now,
finally--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i've
only
one
short
point
remaining.
it
is
this:
that
commercial
paper,
because
it
is
indistinguishable
from
a
short-term
commercial
loan,
has
always
been
so
treated
by
all
three
of
the
bank
regulators.
and
if
i
can
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix,
in
which
the
board's
statement
in
this
case
is
reproduced
at
page
130.
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
the
board
says
the
following:
"the
present
attitude
of
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
is
consistent
with
the
view
that
commercial
paper
is
properly
viewed
as
a
loan,
not
as
an
investment
security.
"
"the
instructions
of
each
of
the
three
federal
banking
agencies
for
preparation
of
call
reports
direct
that
commercial
paper
be
treated
as
a
loan.
"
"in
addition,
the
federal
reserve's
manual
of
examination
procedures
follows
the
same
position.
"
that
of
course
is
relevant
on
a
day
to
day
basis
for
each
bank
to
determine
whether
the
limits
applicable
to
loans
or
the
limits
applicable
to
investment
securities
are
applicable
when
it
takes
in
commercial
paper
into
its
inventory.
from
1927
to
this
day,
the
banking
fraternity,
with
the
approval
and
indeed
at
the
direction
of
the
banking
regulators,
has
treated
commercial
paper
in
the
category
of
loans,
not
investment
or
security.
now,
this
kind
of
decision
as
to
which
category
commercial
paper
falls
in
is
precisely
one
as
to
which
there
is
properly
owed
deference
to
the
bank
regulators.
it
is
not,
as
is
suggested
on
the
other
side,
that
congress
made
the
board
or
the
comptroller
regulators
in
the
sense
that
they
were
given
discretion
to
waive
in
appropriate
cases
the
prohibitions
of
the
glass-steagall
act.
of
course
they
have
no
such
discretion.
but
they
do
have
a
job
to
construe,
to
interpret
the
words
of
the
statute
which
they
are
required
to
enforce.
and
it
is
in
that
sense
that
deference
is
due
to
their
special
expertise.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
hindsight,
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
i
can
say
on
the
one
hand
that
it
seems
the
inevitable
reading
in
light
of
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
result
which
the
board
came
to,
but
at
the
same
time
say
that
if
i
am
wrong
in
that
respect
and
there
are
two
reasonable
readings,
so
long
as
the
board
made
a
reasonable
reading,
deference
ought
to
be
accorded
to
that
reading.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
quite
agree.
but
i
may
be
wrong--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
see
no--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
board
did
not,
as
is
alleged,
say
that
the
statute
literally
read
the
other
way.
the
board
said
the
statute
could
by
the
untutored
eye
be
read
to
mean
something
different,
but
when
we
read
it
in
context,
when
we
read
it
against
the
legislative
history,
when
we
read
section
16
and
section
21
together,
then
we
reach
what
the
board
called
the
stronger
position.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
difficult
to
construe
whether
by
"stronger"
they
meant...
they
were
simply
being
cautious
or
whether
they
were
being
less
positive.
but
in
all
events,
we
do
urge
that
on
the
matter
of
construction
the
board,
if
there
is
a
doubt
about
it,
is
entitled
to
the
deference
in
this
peculiarly
complex
area.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
my
impression
is
not
so
because,
with
respect
to
the
securities
laws,
it's
perfectly
clear
that,
while
commercial
paper
is
a
covered
security,
it
is
exempted
from
the
registration
requirement.
and
the
board
has
looked
to
the
definition
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
commercial
paper
in
the
securities
laws,
so
the
two
are
meshed.
let
me
say
one
final
thing
about
the
deference
due
to
the
board.
i
need
only
invoke
what
this
court
twice
said,
both
in
ici
i
and
in
ici
ii,
about
the
deference
that
is
indeed
due
to
the
regulators,
whether
the
comptroller
or
the
board,
provided
however,
which
is
what
was
lacking
in
ici
i,
that
that
regulator
not
merely
announce
a
rule,
but
do
so
by
articulating
his
reasons
for
having
got
there
in
what
is
certainly
present
here,
a
comprehensive
and
careful
parsing
of
legislative
text,
the
legislative
history,
the
policy
as
identified
by
this
court
which
informed
the
passage
of
the
act,
and
only
then,
after
this
careful
articulation,
reach
a
conclusion.
in
those
circumstances,
as
the
court
indicated
would
be
true
when
that
was
done,
the
board
ought
be
entitled
to
this
deference.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor.
i
must
have
missed
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
that
is
probably
so,
because
congress
was
aware
that
banks
were
dealing
in
bankers
acceptances,
not
yet
in
certificates
of
deposit.
but
it
seems
to
be
accepted
all
around
that
that
dealing
in
certificates
of
deposit
is
not
in
any
way
prohibited
by
the
glass-steagall
act
and
nevertheless
the
banks
are
not
required
to
register
as
dealers
under
the
securities
act.
and
these
relatively
small-scale...
huge
sums,
but
the
percentage
of
earnings
for
the
banks
out
of
their
dealings
in
commercial
paper
is
a
relatively
small
quantity,
an
insignificant
proportion
of
the
banks'
earnings.
the
purpose
of
the
banks
is
that
it
was
a
way
of
selling
their
other
services
to
those
for
whom
they
perform
this
almost
accommodation
service.
