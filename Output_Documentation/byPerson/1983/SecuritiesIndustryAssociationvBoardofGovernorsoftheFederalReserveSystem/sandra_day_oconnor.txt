i'm
a
little
unclear.
is
commercial
paper
an
investment
security
in
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
section
16?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
how
about
the
statute?
i
mean,
was
it
intended
that
investment
security
incorporate
commercial
paper
by
congress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
certainly
not
all
notes,
though,
are
included?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
assume
that
all
notes
are
not
covered
by
section
21.
certificates
of
deposit
or
loan
participations
or
bankers
acceptances,
maybe
even
cash,
they're
not
included,
are
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
if
you
were
right
there
would
then
be
conflicts
with
other
sections
of
the
banking
laws,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose,
though,
that
a
regulatory
agency's
interpretation
of
a
statute
is
of
some
significance
for
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
particularly
in
a
field
as
complicated
and
specific
as
this
one
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
if
you're
right
the
limitations
placed
on
the
type
of
commercial
paper
that
can
be
marketed
are
irrelevant,
because
they
wouldn't
have
to
impose
those
limitations
to
make
commercial
paper
marketable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--sure.
but
it
appears
that
your
argument
would
reach
any
kind
of
commercial
paper.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
would
have
exempted
banks
from
the
securities
regulation
field
if
they
had
thought
that
all
commercial
paper
was
excluded
from
the
glass-steagall
act
provisions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
your
position,
i
take
it,
that
banks
are
not
considered
brokers
and
dealers
under
the
securities
act,
the
securities
exchange
act,
right?
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
banks
would
have
been
so
treated
if
congress
had
understood
that
all
commercial
paper
was
outside
the
scope
of
glass-steagall?
