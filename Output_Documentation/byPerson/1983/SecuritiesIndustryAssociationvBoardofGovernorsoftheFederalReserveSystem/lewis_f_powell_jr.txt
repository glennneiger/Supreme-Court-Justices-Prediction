mr.
claiborne,
is
it
possible
that
a
bank
could
end
up
in
a
position
of
conflict
of
interest
if,
for
example,
take
the
penn
central
case,
banks
had
lent
penn
central
money
and
also
had
underwritten
and
sold
its
commercial
paper,
and
after
the
sale
of
the
commercial
paper
the
bank
began
to
think,
well,
after
all,
penn
central
is
not
such
a
super
risk
and
perhaps
we
better
call
the
loan?
would
it
not
be
then
in
a
conflict
of
interest
position?

and
would
an
investment
banking
house
have
a
similar
possibility
of
conflict?
