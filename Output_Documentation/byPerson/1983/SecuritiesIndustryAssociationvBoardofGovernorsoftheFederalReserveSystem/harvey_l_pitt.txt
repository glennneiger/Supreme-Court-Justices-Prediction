mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
dividing
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
upheld
a
federal
reserve
board
ruling
permitting
bankers
trust
company
to
market
and
corporate
commercial
paper
notes
for
the
first
time
since
the
glass-steagall
act
was
passed
nearly
50
years
ago.
both
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
glass-steagall
act
should
be
given
a
narrower
reading
than
the
literal
language
or
its
unmistakable
legislative
purposes
would
dictate.
the
court
below
in
essence
directed
that
the
federal
reserve
board
should
be
free
on
a
case
by
case
basis
to
adapt
the
glass-steagall
act's
flat
prohibitions
to
current
business
reality
and
changing
financial
needs
of
our
economy.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
court
that
that
decision
should
be
reversed,
first
because
it
ignores
the
plain
language
and
leaves
our
financial
system
open
to
precisely
the
hazards
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
glass-steagall
act
over
50
years
ago.
second,
it's
inconsistent
with
the
specific
policy
choice
that
congress
made.
when
congress
considered
the
glass-steagall
act
and
the
dangers
that
had
given
rise
to
that
statute,
it
had
before
it
the
choice
of
absolute
prohibition
or
case
by
case
regulation
with
delegation
to
an
administrative
agency.
congress
rejected
regulation
and
chose
absolute
prohibition,
as
this
court
has
twice
noted.
for
that
reason,
the
court
below
erred
in
undoing
the
specific
policy
choice
the
congress
had
made.
and
finally,
the
decision
below
represents
a
bad
policy
choice
that
not
only
is
not
justified
by
the
statute
and
by
its
legislative
history,
but
that,
as
recent
events
have
shown,
will
substitute
litigation
and
case
by
case
administrative
revisionism
for
resolving
what
bank
activities
are
appropriate.
this
would
mark
the
first
time
in
our
history
as
a
country
and
as
a
nation
that
any
court
has
done
so.
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
relatively
simple
and
straightforward.
in
1978
bankers
trust
company,
which
is
a
state
bank
which
is
a
member
of
the
federal
reserve
system,
began
underwriting
commercial
paper
notes
issued
by
third
party
corporations.
the
federal
reserve
board
ruled
that
this
was
legal,
not
because
the
statute
didn't
cover
it,
but
because
the
statute
shouldn't
be
read
to
cover
it
even
though
its
literal
terms
so
provided.
the
court
said...
the
federal
reserve
board
said
that
commercial
paper
is
more
like
a
bank
loan,
even
though
it
is
conceded
that
the
bank
is
not
lending
anyone
any
money
in
the
activity
of
distributing
and
underwriting
commercial
paper.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
board
has
never
expressly
forbidden
such
a
thing,
because
the
statute
has
forbidden
it.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
but
i
might
point
out
that
since
the
passage
of
the
glass-steagall
act
no
bank
has
ever
underwritten
commercial
paper?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no
bank
has
asked
the
federal
reserve
board
to
be
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
were
some
isolated
instances
of
banks
underwriting
commercial
paper.
but
by
and
large,
the
overwhelming
function
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
glass-steagall
act
was
for
banks
to
purchase
commercial
paper,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
making
a
loan,
and
of
course
there
is
express
authority
for
banks
to
do
that.
in
our
system
banks
are
permitted
to
do
that
which
is
expressly
provided,
and
they
may
not
do
that
which
is
not
expressly
permitted.
in
this
case,
the
glass-steagall
act
takes
that
regime
a
step
further
and
says
that
banks,
particularly
state
member
banks
and
national
banks
and
all
banks,
may
not
underwrite
commercial
paper
notes.
it
is
unmistakable
from
the
language
of
the
statute
that
the
statute
prohibits
the
underwriting
of
notes,
and
no
one
disputes
that
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
the
board
is
free
to
say
that
some
notes
will
be
treated
in
accordance
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
and
other
notes
will
not
be
treated
in
accordance
with
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
i
would
state
that
the
government
is
correct
that
commercial
paper
is
not
presently
defined
as
an
investment
security.
and
i
might
add
here
that
section
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--the
point
i
am
making,
your
honor,
is
that
the
term
is
not...
that
within
the
meaning
of
that
term,
commercial
paper
is
not
an
investment
security
because
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
an
entity
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
has
never
defined
commercial
paper
as
an
investment
security.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
is
no
indication
that
the
statute
need
exclude
commercial
paper
from
that
context.
it
is
simply
not...
it
is
not
discussed.
but
the
term
"investment
security",
your
honor,
does
not
have
any
relevance
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
reason
i
state
that
is
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
specific
bar.
in
section
21
the
statute
says
that
it
is
unlawful
for
any
entity
that
engages
in
issuing,
underwriting,
selling
or
distributing
funds,
notes,
debentures
securities,
and
other
securities
from
also
taking
deposits.
the
term
21
without
any
qualifier
and
without
any
reference
to
investment
securities
or
otherwise,
and
thus
for
this
purpose
it's
irrelevant
whether
one
deems
commercial
paper
to
be
an
investment
security
or
not.
section
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act
has
a
flat
prohibition.
it
says
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
national
bank
to
underwrite
any
issue
of
securities
or
stock.
there
is
absolutely
no
qualification
whatsoever
in
that
prohibition.
there
are
provisions
in
section
16,
however,
which
indicate...
and
this
is
the
critical
facet
of
the
structure
of
the
glass-steagall
act...
that
when
congress
wanted
to
permit
banks
to
underwrite
specific
securities,
it
knew
how
to
do
so.
appended
to
section
16
is
a
laundry
list
of
15
securities
that
are
in
the
form
of
notes
that
the
congress
has
directed
banks
may
underwrite.
in
section
21,
in
1935
congress
amended
the
provisions
of
section
21
specifically
to
provide
that
banks
might
underwrite
mortgage
notes,
because
there
had
been
the
claim
that
mortgage
notes
would
be
encompassed
within
the
broad
prohibition
against
underwriting
any
notes.
congress
responded
in
'35
and
gave
banks
that
authority
and
said
that
the
section
should
not
prohibit
that.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
absolutely,
your
honor.
judge
wilkie's
reading,
which
i
think
was
a
narrowing,
and
he
conceded
it
was
a
narrowing,
of
the
literal
language,
suggested
that
when
one
looks
at
the
various
entities
that
precede
the
word
"notes"...
the
statute
reads
"stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes
and
other
securities.
"
--that
one
ought
to
view
"notes"
as
potentially
meaning
notes
for
the
raising
of
capital
for
permanent
purposes
for
corporations.
where
he
found
those
words
we
are
not
certain,
but
they
don't
appear
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
moreover,
he
seized
upon
three
factors
which
he
indicated
would
determine
when
a
note
would
be
within
the
statute
and
not.
the
three
factors
that
he
alluded
to
and
that
the
board
has
alluded
to
in
this
case
are
the
denominations
of
the
notes,
the
nature
of
the
purchasers,
and
whether
the
notes
were
of
prime
quality.
none
of
those
things
have
to
do
with
whether
the
note
is
being
used
to
raise
capital
or
not.
so
that
after
having
totally
taken
the
statute
out
of
context
and
then
relying
on
factors
that
bear
no
resemblance
to
the
specific
criteria
he
applied,
he
concluded
that
commercial
paper
notes
were
not
within
the
statute.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
this
is
his
functional
analysis
and
the
board's
functional
analysis.
and
i
might
add
that
that
functional
analysis
is
precisely
what
the
evil
in
this
case
is,
because
it
substitutes
a
regime
of
case
by
case
regulation
for
what
congress
decided
ought
to
be
an
absolute
prohibition.
this
is
one
of
the
instances
in
that
period
of
legislation
in
which
congress
said:
we
will
not
rely
on
government
regulation;
we
want
prohibition;
and
when
we
think
a
bank
ought
to
be
able
to
engage
in
activity,
we
will
so
specify.
and
there
have
been
numerous
examples
of
those
specifications.
as
i
have
indicated,
in
the
relevant
universe
of
the
statute,
sections
21
and
16,
there
are
two
major
categories
that
congress
deals
with
in
the
glass-steagall
act.
one
are
the
instruments
to
which
the
glass-steagall
relates,
and
second
are
the
activities
which
are
prohibited.
a
careful
review
of
the
statute
shows
that
both
the
instruments
to
which
the
statute
relates
and
the
activities
prohibited
are
all-encompassing.
there
are
no
activities
that
are
not
governed
by
this
statute.
one
need
only
look
at
the
listing
of
terms...
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
and
other
securities...
to
understand
that
congress
had
in
mind
all
instruments
by
which
corporations
obtain
any
form
of
capital.
second,
when
one
looks
at
the
specific
activities
in
the
statute,
it
is
equally
clear
that
congress
parsed
out
and
covered
every
conceivable
activity
that
a
bank
could
engage
in
in
the
context
of
these
instruments.
it
dealt
with
purchasing,
selling,
issuing,
underwriting,
distributing.
the
statute
is
unmistakable
in
terms
of
its
breadth
and
its
scope.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
totally
redundant.
section
16
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
national
banks.
section
21
applies
to
any
deposit-taking
institution.
both
contain
co-equal
prohibitions
on
underwriting,
but
sections
16
and
21
have
different
formulations
with
respect
to
certain
activities
of
banks
that
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
for
example,
with
respect
to
investment
securities,
there
are
distinctions
that
are
made
in
section
16
that
are
not
made
in
section
21
for
different
types
of
entities.
but
both
provisions
are
unmistakable
in
providing
the
universe
of
deposit-taking
institutions,
that
they
may
not
underwrite
notes
or
other
securities.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
16
refers
to
the
broader
term
of
securities.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
and
one
need
only
look
to
section
21
to
indicate
that
the
term
21,
which
starts
with
stocks,
bonds,
debentures,
notes,
and
then
says
"and
other
securities".
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
a
note
to
be
a
security
within
the
meaning
of
both
provisions.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
this
case
only
involves
commercial
paper.
but
the
scope
of
the
term
"notes"
means
any
notes.
for
things
like
certificates
of
deposits
and
other
legitimate
banking
functions,
there
are
specific
and
permissible
activities.
all
of
the
normal
functions
that
banks
have
always
performed,
even
with
respect
to
commercial
paper,
are
provided
for
in
the
banking
laws.
but
the
term
21
is
as
broad
as
any
note.
witness
the
exemption
for
mortgage
notes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
that
is
not
correct.
there
are
no
legitimate
banking
functions...
and
the
government
has
not
referred
to
any.
the
government
has
in
the
context
of
this
case
attempted
to
establish
that
certain
activities,
some
of
which
are
questionable,
may
be
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision.
i
think
there
are
two
simple
answers
to
that.
first,
this
case
only
involves
commercial
paper,
notes
that
are
clearly
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
term,
not
only
because
they
fit
literally
but
because
there's
contemporaneous
congressional
evidence
that
congress
intended
commercial
paper
to
be
included
within
the
scope
of
that
statute.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
a
certificate
of
deposit
is,
and
banks
have
express
authority
to
issue
notes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
prohibition
in
section
21
has
to
be
read
with
respect
to
the
express
authority
that
banks
are
also
granted,
and
banks
are
granted
the
authority
to
discount
and--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--well,
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
national
banks
section
16
sets
forth
the
express
powers
of
those
banks.
with
respect
to
state
member
banks,
many
of
the
restrictions
and
provisions
of
section
16
are
provided
to
state
member
banks.
section
21,
which
deals
with
any
depository
institution,
is
basically
silent
as
to
the
affirmative
powers
of
depository
institutions,
and
that
means
that
whatever
affirmative
powers
they
have,
as
this
court
has--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
section
21
defines
a
depository
institution
within
its
terms
as
one
that
may
issue
certificates
of
deposits
and
other
instruments
for
the
conduct
of
banking
business.
if
you
look
at
the
precise
language
of
section
21,
your
honor,
it
defines
the
term
"deposit-taking
institution"
as
an
institution
that
receives
deposits
subject
to
check
or
to
repayment
upon
presentation
of
a
passbook,
certificate
of
deposit,
or
other
evidence
of
debt.
within
section
21
itself,
it
expressly
recognizes
that
these
are
traditional
banking
functions
and
uses
them
to
define
the
entities
that
are
within
its
prohibition.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
that
is
correct.
a
bank
that
receives
deposits
may
issue
a
certificate
of
deposit,
but
it
may
not...
one
of
the
questions
is
it
may
not
engage
in
a
marketing
scheme.
it
may
obtain
funds
from
individual
investors,
individual
depositors
in
return
for
a
certificate
of
deposit
which
bears
interest.
that
is
expressly
contemplated
by
section
21
and
it's
expressly
within
the
purview
of
other
affirmative
banking
statutes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
whether
they
need
to
hold
that--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--well,
the
certificate
of
deposit
in
that
case
is
held
of
course
by
the
depositors.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
i'm
not
certain
i'm
following
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
it
is
in
form
a
note
of
the
bank
when
it
is
held
by
the
depositor.
in
form
it
is.
but
it
is
not
a
note
that
the
bank
is
underwriting
or
engaging
in
any
prohibited
activity,
because
banks
raise
capital
by
issuing
notes
and
that
is
a
permissible
activity
within
section
21.
the
contemporaneous
legislative
history
of
the
glass-steagall
act
i
think
makes
quite
clear
that
commercial
paper
is
both
a
note
and
a
security
for
purposes
of
these
prohibitions.
we
start
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
camp
case,
which
held
that
the
term
"security"
should
be
construed
broadly,
not
just
literally
but
broadly
and
flexibly
to
accomplish
its
purpose.
indeed,
in
the
four
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
defined
terms
in
the
glass-steagall
act
this
court
has
continually
urged
that
those
terms
are
not
to
be
given
a
narrow
or
restrictive
reading,
but
are
to
be
given
a
broad
reading.
in
this
case,
we
simply
urge
that
they
be
given
at
a
minimum
their
literal
reading,
as
well
as
accomplishing
the
regulatory
purposes.
the
structure
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
as
i've
indicated,
confirms
that
"notes"
were
intended
to
have
its
plain
meaning.
in
addition,
if
one
looks
at
other
legislation,
both
contemporaneously
and
other
banking
legislation,
it
is
clear
that
when
congress
wanted
to
qualify
the
types
of
notes
that
it
was
restricting
it
knew
how
to
do
so.
for
example,
there
are
statutes
in
which
congress
refers
to
capital
notes.
section
16
itself
refers
to
notes
commonly
known
as
investment
securities,
for
which
there
is
a
limited
authorization
of
purchase.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
every
instance
in
which
congress
wanted
to
restrict
the
scope
of
its
prohibitions
it
said
so
and
it
did
so
plainly.
moreover,
one
need
look
at
the
securities
laws,
which
were
enacted
at
exactly
the
same
time
and
by
exactly
the
same
congress
and
by
exactly
the
same
committees
to
understand
that
congress
clearly
understood
commercial
paper
to
be
a
note.
in
the
securities
act
of
1933,
congress
specifically
defines
"security"
to
include
any
note.
senator
glass,
one
of
the
architects
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
went
before
the
committee
when
it
was
considering
the
'33
act
and
suggested
that
perhaps
the
congress
ought
to
exclude
commercial
paper,
specifically
commercial
paper,
from
the
provisions
of
the
securities
act.
congress
rejected
that
suggestion,
but
adopted
a
narrow
prohibition
against
requiring
registration.
it
exempted
commercial
paper
for
the
registration
requirements
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
the
answer
is
they
are
most
certainly
relevant,
your
honor.
they
clearly
evidence--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--they...
let
me
say
this,
that
both
statutes
were
enacted
to
deal
with
the
same
abuses
and
evils,
and
they
approach
the
problem
from
different
ends.
with
respect
to
the
glass-steagall
act,
the
glass-steagall
act
prohibits
banks
from
engaging
in
the
securities
business.
one
presumably
would
look
to
the
federal
securities
laws
to
define
what
the
securities
business
is.
it
was
the
same
committee
and
the
same
congress,
dealing
with
the
same
evils,
that
adopted
both
statutes.
the
board
itself
in
its
ruling
indicated
that
the
definitions
and
provisions
of
the
securities
act
were
clearly
relevant.
they
have
argued
that
they
are
not
dispositive.
i
am
raising
the
securities
act
in
this
court
simply
to
indicate
that
congress
understood
that
when
it
used
the
term
"notes"
and
when
it
used
the
term
"securities"
that
that
would
include
commercial
paper
unless
it
exempted
it.
when
one
goes
back
to
the
glass-steagall
act
and
sees
the
broad
definitional
terms
that
were
used,
and
that
literally
encompass
commercial
paper,
one
has
to
go
a
long
way
to
find
a
basis
for
excluding
out
of
the
statute
that
which
congress
has
expressly
recognized
would
otherwise
be
included.
beyond
that,
in
1935
when
congress
amended
the
glass-steagall
act
with
some
technical
amendments,
congress
did
put
in
an
amendment
to
section
21
of
the
glass-steagall
act,
as
i
have
indicated,
allowing
banks
to
underwrite
mortgage
notes.
again,
if
"notes"
did
not
mean
all
notes
and
certainly
not
long-term
capital
raising
notes,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
exemption
for
mortgage
notes.
congress
a
day
earlier
amended...
adopted
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
of
1935.
in
that
statute
congress
said
that
public
utility
holding
companies
were
prohibited
from
purchasing
securities.
however,
it
excepted
such
commercial
paper
and
other
securities
as
the
sec
might
permit
by
regulation.
in
each
instance,
both
in
'33
and
in
'35,
when
congress
dealt
with
the
terms
"notes"
and
"securities",
it
understood
that
commercial
paper
would
be
included
unless
it
was
specifically
excluded.
there
was
no
specific
exclusion
here,
and
so
the
board
has
relegated...
arrogated
to
itself
the
capacity
to
exclude
it
on
its
own.
that
we
submit
is
what
the
board
may
not
do.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes.
banks
specifically
have
the
authority--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--to
discount
and
negotiate
notes.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
expressed
in
section
16,
yes.
the
board's
efforts
basically
to
avoid
the
plain
language
really
relate
not
so
much
to
any
reliance
on
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
but
to
a
disagreement
with
the
policy
that
congress
formulated...
an
effort,
in
essence,
to
change
the
structure
of
the
statute.
the
board
adopted
a
functional
analysis
in
which
it
suggested
that
any
instrument
which
might
be
functionally
similar
to
a
traditional
commercial
banking
operation
or
which
displayed
the
economic
characteristics
of
a
commercial
loan
should
be
permissible
for
the
board
to
exempt
out
of
the
statute.
there
are
two
immediate
problems
with
that.
the
first
is
that
the
statute
does
not
say
this
and
it
gives
the
board
absolutely
no
regulatory
power
under
either
section
16
or
21.
i
want
to
stress
that
the
board
of
governors
has
absolutely
no
power
to
regulate
under
either
of
those
two
provisions.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
your
honor,
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
agency's
interpretation
of
a
statute
which
it
is
charged
with
administering
is
entitled
to
some
deference.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
there
is
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
that
general
policy
certainly
obtains,
but
it
does
not
obtain
here
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
board
is
not
engaged
in
interpretation
here.
the
board
is
engaged
in
regulation.
i
say
that
because
if
the
court
refers
to
not
only
the
board's
statement,
but
also
its
lawyers'
explanations
of
that
statement
before
the
courts
below...
and
particularly
i
am
referring
to
pages
136
and
192
of
the
joint
appendix...
the
board
has
continually
said
that
it
reserves
the
right...
and
i
may
now
quote:
"the
board
did
not
say
that
any
one
particular
fact
was
determinative.
"
"the
board
did
not
say
that
all
short-term
notes
were
not
securities.
"
"it
did
not
say
that
all
non-speculative
notes
were
not
securities.
"
"the
board's
determination
is
based
on
this
particular
combination
of
the
factors
involved.
"
"if
the
factors
change,
then
the
board's
conclusion
is
very
likely
to
change.
"
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
that's
not
interpretation,
that's
regulation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--that
is
correct.
that
is
precisely
our
contention.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
if
i
may.
in
response
to
the
questions
both
by
justice
white
and
justice
o'connor,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
page
26,
note
33,
of
the
sia's
opening
brief,
which
indicates
that
both
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
and
the
securities
exchange
commission
had
to
take
emergency
action
to
obviate
the
impact
on
both
the
federal
energy
laws
and
the
sec's
authority
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
because
of
the
board's
unprecedented
ruling
involving
management
interlocks
and
related
issues.
secondly,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
sec
has
recently
promulgated
a
proposed
rule
which
would
undo
the
very
statutory
exemption
to
which
justice
o'connor
was
referring.
that
is
to
say,
the
federal
securities
laws
presently
exempt
banks
from
the
definition
of
brokers
and
dealers.
the
sec
has
said
that,
in
light
of
the
activity
of
the
banking
agencies...
and
it's
the
decision
in
the
court
below
which
has
been
the
mainspring
from
which
all
of
these
decisions
have
flowed...
it
is
necessary
for
that
agency
to
reconsider
whether
the
exemptions
given
to
banks
from
these
definitions
are
appropriate.
and
so
what
we
are
faced
with
is
a
flurry
of
administrative
revisionism.
this
is
hardly
what
congress
could
have
intended--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--the
sec
did
make
its
views
known
before
the
board
and
it
vehemently
disagreed.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
they
are,
your
honor.
all
letters
written
by
the
sec,
first
from
its
general
counsel
and
then
reaffirmed
by
the
commission,
are
in
the
record.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
they
took
a
position
in
the
district
court,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
did
not
take
a
position.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
but
their
brief
is
in
the
record
before
the
court.
finally,
just
one
additional
point.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
briefs
of
the
parties
do
discuss
the
hazards
presented,
and
i
think
the
questions
earlier
this
morning
indicated
that
it
is
precisely
the
function
of
a
bank
being
both
a
lender
to
a
corporation
and
a
promoter
and
marketer
of
its
corporate
paper,
commercial
paper
notes,
are
exactly
the
conflicts
glass-steagall
was
designed
to
prohibit.
and
both
of
the
briefs
on
the
petitioners'
side
are
replete
with
instances
of
the
precise
hazards
that
are
involved.
beyond
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
state--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--i
would
say
banks
syndicate
loans
regularly
and
always
have.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
no,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
this
is--
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
--this
is
a
marketing
activity.
this
is
a
marketing
activity.
bankers
trust
isn't
lending
anyone
any
money.
what
it
is
doing
is
it's
placing
its
reputation
and
the
resources
of
the
bank
behind
an
investment
banking
effort,
and
that's
what
glass-steagall
was
designed
to
prohibit.
mr.
harvey
l.
pitt
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'm
pleased
you
asked
me
that,
because
i
did
want
to
comment
that
the
positions
taken
were
with
respect
to
commercial
paper
as
a
purchase
and
as
a
loan.
there
has
never
been
a
position
taken
prior
to
the
ones
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case
that
banks
could
underwrite
commercial
paper.
and
i
might
add
that
mr.
claiborne's
prior
references
to
the
congressional
history
demonstrate
that
congress
intended
for
banks
to
purchase
commercial
paper,
and
there
is
clear
authority
for
that,
but
not
to
underwrite
it,
and
that's
the
essence
of
this
case.
