mr.
pitt,
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
i
think
it
may
be
similar
to
one
justice
rehnquist
asked.
supposing
a
bank
issues
a
group
of
unsecured
notes,
not
mortgage
notes.
somebody
borrows
money
from
the
bank
and
they
get
notes
in
exchange.
can
they
discount
those
notes
to
another
bank?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
an
express
statutory
provision?
