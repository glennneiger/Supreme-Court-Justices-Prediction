unknown
speaker
just
this
one
jail,
that's
over
4,000
square
miles?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bennett,
when
you
say
they're
involved
in
appellate
process,
you
mean
perhaps
a
motion
to
suppress
that's
appealed
prior
to
trial,
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
but
they're
not
members
of
the
class,
are
they?
isn't
the
class
just
pretrial
detainees?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
referred
only
to
pretrial
detainees,
that
the
order
only
referred
to
them.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
legal
issues
would
be
quite
different
if
they
were
sentenced
people,
would
they
not?
unknown
speaker
but
there
still
are
within
the
technically
certified
class
a
small
minority
who
are
not
pretrial
detainees?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
claim
here,
mr.
bennett,
that
those
objectives
could
have
been
accomplished
by
less
intrusive,
less
restrictive
measures?
that
is,
using
a
wire
screen
that
would
prevent
the
passing
of
weapons
or
narcotics,
but
eliminating
the
telephone?
is
there
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
this
included
children
as
well
as
adults?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
your
new
york
counterpart
disagrees
with
some
of
the
things
you've
just
said?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on.
do
you
have
any
record
or
any
statistics
on
the
drug
problem
within
the
facility?
to
what
extent
has
there
been
a
drug
problem?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bennett,
before
you
get
into
that.
you
started
to
tell
us
about
the
three
classes
of
inmates
and
i
was
curious
to
know...
as
i
understand
the
district
court's
order,
it
only
applies
to
those
who
have
been
in
the
facility
for
over
30
days,
and
also
it
excludes
the
drug
people
who
can
be
identified
as
associated
with
drug
traffic,
i
guess.
how
many
people
does
the
order
apply
to,
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
put
a
ceiling
of
1500.
it
didn't
require
you
to
have
1500
visits,
as
i
read
the
order.
it
says
no
more
than
1500.
unknown
speaker
and
out
of
those,
how
many
would
be...
how
many
could
you
segregate
out
as
having
association
with
drug
traffic
or
being
particularly
violent?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
any
classification
system
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
for
example,
if
someone's
arrested
on
a
drug
charge
presumably
the
jailer
would
know
that
and
just
make
him
ineligible
for
this
visit.
that
wouldn't
be
very
difficult,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out...
and
i
don't
know
if
the
record
will
tell
us...
is
how
many
people
would
get
the
benefit
of
this
order
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
affirmed,
in
your
judgment?
if
you
assume
you
can
identify
people
who
were
arrested
for
murder
and
people
who
were
arrested
on
drug
charges--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
asking
you
what
the
court
expected
you
to
find.
it
put
a
1500
person
ceiling,
i
understand
that.
how
many
people
do
you
think
the
order
will
benefit?
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
idea?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
he
do
that?
the
court
didn't
require
him
to
find
a
lot
of
people.
the
court
put
a
ceiling
on.
is
he
going
to
go
out
looking
for
people
unnecessarily,
to
make
it
as
hard
a
case
as
possible?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
told
him
that
you
thought
he
shouldn't
do
any
more
than
absolutely
necessary?
how
many
people
would
then
be
involved,
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
any
idea?
unknown
speaker
the
inmates
and
the
guards.
unknown
speaker
the
guards
don't
like
it
either.
unknown
speaker
well,
before
you
leave
the
contact
visit
issue,
may
i
ask
you.
as
i
understand
it,
if
we're
talking
about
pretrial
detainees
the
issue
is
whether
it
can
be
punishment
under
bell
against
wolfish.
in
your
view,
could
it
ever
be
punishment,
no
matter
how
long
the
incarceration,
to
deny
a
person
who
has
not
yet
been
tried
any
contact
whatsoever
with
his
family?
could
that
ever
constitute
punishment?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
if
it's
punishment.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
it
could
never
become
punishment
as
long
as
other
alternatives
that
are
less
desirable
to
the
inmate
are
provided?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
would.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bronstein,
can
you
answer
the
question
that
was
earlier
asked
mr.
bennett
as
to
approximately
how
many
people
are
included
within
the
class
certified?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bronstein,
i
have
a
recollection,
but
i
haven't
been
able
to
check
it
out,
of
a
case
that
came
to
us
from
the
second
circuit
that
involved
a
contact
visit
with
the
mother
bringing
a
small
child
in,
and
in
new
york
they
had,
or
at
least
in
the
second
circuit,
there
had
been
a
screen
barrier
that
was
preventing
the
transfer
of
drugs
or
weapons
or
anything
else.
do
you
recall
that
case?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i'm
confusing
one--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
is
the
precise
definition
of
the
class
certified,
do
you
know,
mr.
bronstein?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
the
one
there's
the
1500
cap?
unknown
speaker
and
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
convicted
ones
who
are
also
detainees?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren't
there
some
of
those
that
are
convicted?
aren't
some
pretrial
detainees
convicted
felons?
unknown
speaker
yes.
aren't
there
many
of
them?
unknown
speaker
does
it
apply
to
them?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
class
is
certified
not
just
to
include
mr.
rutherford,
who
you
say
was
there
for
39
months,
but
to
include
anyone
who
is
there
for
more
than
30
days.
so
that
we
have
to
analyze
it
in
terms
of
someone
who
has
been
there
35
days
as
well
as
someone
who's
been
there
39
months.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
suggest
that
there's
no
risk
of
having
drugs
or
weapons
come
into
prisons,
mr.
bronstein?
unknown
speaker
some
risk?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it's
just
some
risk,
or
that
it
is
an
enormous
risk?
unknown
speaker
i'm
speaking
of
generally.
lay
aside
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
for
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
if
you
knew
ryker's
island,
you'd
find
you
can
learn
a
whole
lot
in
one
day.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any...
i
know
there's
no
evidence
as
to
how
much
of
drugs
came
in
during
that
period.
unknown
speaker
there
is--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
incident
would
be
a
person
being
caught.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
record
of
those
who
were
not
caught.
unknown
speaker
the
trial
judge
didn't
make
new
findings
after
the
remand,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
he
just
relied
on
his--
unknown
speaker
--court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
he
could
have
held
it?
he
could
have
made
new
findings.
unknown
speaker
is
that
speaking
only
of
pretrial
detainees?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think,
mr.
bronstein,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
classification
of
prisoners
in
the
federal
system
and
in
what
we're
dealing
with
here?
what
kind
of
crimes
bring
people,
25,
30,000
people,
into
federal
prisons
as
compared
with--
unknown
speaker
--a
great
many
so-called
white
collar
crimes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bronstein,
the
court
of
appeals
in
remanding
to
the
district
court
said...
this
was
in
giving
the
district
court
some
guidance:
"a
condition
is
punitive
if
there
is
a
showing
of
express
intent
to
punish.
"
"otherwise,
if
a
particular
condition
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate,
non-punitive
objective,
it
does
not,
without
more,
amount
to
punishment.
"
unknown
speaker
well
now,
my
question
to
you
is,
do
you
think
that
invites
a
balancing
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
invites
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
particular
restriction
is
reasonably
related
to
a
non-punitive
goal?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--the
district
court
said:
"thus,
it
seems
to
me,
regardless
of
how
it's
phrased,
the
test
still
remains
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
"
and
you
think
that's...
you
think
that
wolfish
directs
a
district
judge
just
to
answer,
just
to
decide
what
he
thinks
is
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
he
said.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
suggestion
that
a
district
court's
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
a
condition
is
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
non-punitive
objective
is
a
finding
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
or
his
result
of
a
balance
is
a
finding
of
fact?
unknown
speaker
you've
referred
to
several
times,
mr.
bronstein,
to
overreaction
or...
i've
forgot
the
precise
phrase,
that
there
is
an
overreaction
to--
unknown
speaker
--exaggerated
response
to
the
problem.
suppose
here,
instead
of
a
glass
partition
and
malfunctioning
telephone
that
you
mentioned,
they
put
up
this
fine
screen
which
is
used
in
many
institutions,
where
you
see
the
person,
you
have
a
conversation
normally,
but
you
can't
pass
any
articles
to
them.
would
you
say
that
that
was
permissible?
unknown
speaker
is
that
really
anything
but
a
rather
sophistic
distinction?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
do
you
think
a
district
court
could
properly
say
that,
after
this
court
has
analyzed
a
particular
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment,
to
reach
a
wholly
different
result,
just
saying,
well,
i'm
going
to
use
a
little
different
constitutional
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
that
bear
on
our
opinion
in
wolfish?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bennett?
