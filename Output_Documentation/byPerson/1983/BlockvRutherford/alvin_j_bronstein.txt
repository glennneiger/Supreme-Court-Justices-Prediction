mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
justice
stevens
focused
on
the
real
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
not,
is
not,
a
blanket
constitutional
right
to
contact
visits,
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner.
justice
stevens
asked
whether
under
any
circumstances
the
denial
of
a
contact
visit
could
constitute
punishment,
and
i
think
to
accept
the
county's
argument
and
to
overrule
the
ninth
circuit
this
court
would
have
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
are
no
factual
circumstances
under
which
detainees
would
have
the
right
to
a
barrier-free
visit.
that
is,
that
the
denial
could
never
constitute
punishment,
no
matter
what
the
facts.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
cannot.
i
do
agree
with
justice
stevens
that
the
1500
was
a
cap.
i
have
no
idea.
i
was
not
involved
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
justice
rehnquist.
the
trial
lawyer
is
now
a
judge
and
no
longer
in
the
case.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--not
specifically.
there
is
in
that
circuit,
but
at
the
district
court
level,
the
boudin
versus
thomas
case,
which
dealt
with
the
right
of
a
woman
detainee
to
visit,
to
have
a
contact
visit
with
her
infant
child.
that
case
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
there
the
bureau
of
prisons
wanted
to
make
an
exception
of
this
detainee
because
of
her
particular
notoriety
and
the
district
court
said
that
the
woman
should
be
entitled
to
a
contact
visit.
that
case
was
not
appealed
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
but
i
don't
know
specifically
which
case
you're
referring
to.
i
think,
going
back
to
whether
it
could
ever
constitute
punishment,
we
have
to
visualize,
for
example,
the
plaintiff
rutherford
in
this
case,
who
was
incarcerated
for
39
months,
detained
for
39
months.
assume
that
his
wife
was
pregnant
when
he
went
into
the
jail,
that
she
delivered
three
months
after
he
was
incarcerated.
that
would
mean
that
for
three
years
that
detainee
could
never
touch
that
child,
could
never
hold
that
child,
could
never,
as
is
graphically
illustrated
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
new
york
city
board
of
corrections,
never
put
that
child
on
his
lap.
i'm
referring
to
appendix
c
in
the
board
of
corrections
amicus
brief.
for
three
years,
i'd
say
that
would
be
torture,
not
just
punishment,
and
that's
what
the
county
is
arguing
on
that
visit.
the
county,
mr.
bennett,
my
distinguished
adversary,
focused
a
fair
amount
on
what
he
believes
are
the
factual
support
for
his
position.
unfortunately,
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
are
all
contrary
to
his
assertions,
and
those
findings
were
approved
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
not
being
clearly
erroneous.
two
separate
questions
have
to
be
looked
at:
the
constitutional
bases
for
the
contact
visit
order...
which,
by
the
way,
justice
stevens,
you
are
correct,
applied
only
to
detainees
and
only
to
that
narrow
category
of
low-risk,
long-term
detainees.
the
cell
search
issue,
by
the
way,
appears
to
apply
to
all
prisoners,
but
only
those
who
are
in
the
area
at
the
time
a
search
is
going
to
be
made,
and
i'll
come
back.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
there
were
two
classes
certified,
justice
rehnquist,
a
class
of
detainees
and
a
class
of
sentenced
prisoners.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
there
were
a
large
number
of
sentenced
prisoners.
now
apparently,
i
agree
with
mr.
bennett,
there
are
very
few.
but
the
contact
visit
order
specifically
by
its
terms
applies
only
to
detainees.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
that
is
right.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
it
does
not.
it
speaks
exclusively
to
pretrial
detainees.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
they
may
have
been
convicted
in
some
other
case,
yes.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
don't
know.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
in
this,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
either,
justice
marshall,
whether
it
would
apply
to
them
in
this
case.
i
just
don't
know.
perhaps
mr.
bennett
can
clarify
that
on
his
rebuttal.
the
trial
court
first
found,
following
the
teachings
of
wolfish,
that
the
total
prohibition
on
contact
visits
was
an
exaggerated
response
by
county
officials
to
security
concerns,
which
the
trial
court
found
to
be
punishment
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
also
going
through
this
issue
are
the
fact
that
the
total
prohibition
results
in
unconstitutional
interference
with
important
familial
rights
of
detainees
and
their
families,
following
a
long
line
of
fourteenth
amendment
cases.
on
the
first
argument,
wolfish
teaches
us
that
a
detainee
has
the
right
to
be
free
of
any
punishment,
and
whether
a
condition
or
practice,
the
total
prohibition
in
this
case,
is
punishment
is
essentially
a
factual
question.
the
county
argues
that
to
find
inferred
punitive
intent
you
must
have
a
condition
that
on
its
face
appears
punitive
and
the
condition
must
be
very
harsh,
and
they
refer
to
footnote
20
in
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
wolfish,
the
example
of
loading
a
chain
with
detainees
in
shackles
and
placing
them
in
a
dungeon.
in
other
words,
they
argue
for
a
return
to
the
hands-off
doctrine.
that
assertion
i
submit
flies
in
the
face
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
example
i
gave
you
of
mr.
rutherford
before,
and
historical
facts.
many
practices,
we
know--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--that's
precisely
what
the
district
court
did,
and
if
you'll
notice,
the
district
court
in
its
original
order
provided
that
detainees
there
only
14
days
were
entitled
to
visits.
then...
that's
after
the
17-day
trial.
then,
on
the
county's
application,
the
court
held
another
four-day
hearing,
took
further
evidence
on
the
contact
visit
issue,
and
made
a
factual
finding
that
30
days
would
be
more
appropriate,
to
accommodate
the
county's
concerns.
but
many
practices
that
historically
started
for
valid
reasons,
as
i
started
to
say,
are
today
punishment.
we
know
that
the
penitentiary
in
this
country
was
started
by
the
quakers
for
rehabilitative
purposes,
and
their
concept
was
that
you
lock
people
up
in
silence
and
in
solitude
for
many
years
and
that
they
would
become
penitent
and
be
rehabilitated,
and
of
course
most
of
them
went
mad.
today
we
would
characterize
that
treatment
as
punishment.
corporal
punishment
and
whipping
was
common
in
our
prisons
for
deterrence.
it
was
a
benign
thing.
we
would
deter
bad
conduct
by
publicly
whipping
a
person.
now,
of
course,
we
would
consider
that
punishment.
it
is
true,
as
the
court
said
in
wolfish,
that
effective
management
and
security
concerns
are
legitimate
government
interests
that
may
justify
certain
conditions
or
restrictions
on
detainees,
the
kinds
of
things
that
mr.
bennett
was
talking
about,
and
that
the
court
should
ordinarily
defer
to
corrections
officials
in
the
absence...
this
language
from
wolfish...
in
the
absence
of
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
the
officials
have
exaggerated
their
response.
in
other
words,
the
deference
is
not
absolute.
it
is
true
that
contact
visits,
like
any
other
practice,
present
a
security
problem.
but
as
judge
duffey
said
in
the
boudin
case
i
referred
to
before:
"a
naked
man
in
chains
poses
no
risk.
"
"from
that
point
on,
every
increase
in
freedom
brings
at
least
some
decrease
in
security.
"
"but
obviously,
we
will
not
countenance
keeping
a
person
naked
in
chains.
"
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
do
not
suggest
that
at
all,
and
the
district
court
found
that
there
is
some
risk,
and
prisons
are--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--that's
right.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
the
district
court
found
there
was--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--generally,
in
some
institutions
it
is
a
risk
and
a
problem,
in
some
more,
some
less.
it
exists
in
every
jail
and
prison
that
i
have
visited
in
this
country,
and
i
have
visited
many,
many
hundreds.
and
the
evidence
in
this
record
indicates
that
in
almost
every
prison
in
this
country
contact
visits
is
the
rule,
except
for
people
who
violate
visiting
rules
or
special
categories
of
prisoners,
and
in
most
detection
facilities
today...
many
detention
facilities
today,
including
the
giant
system
in
new
york,
contact
visits
are
permitted
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
know
there
is
always
some
risk.
there
is
also
a
risk
from
correctional
officers
bringing
in
drugs.
we
know
that,
too.
just
two
weeks
ago
at
the
metropolitan
correctional
center
in
new
york,
the
facility
the
subject
of
wolfish,
nine
correctional
officers
were
indicted
for
bringing
in
drugs
as
contraband.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that's
the
rule
every
place.
the
evidence
in
this
record
which
led
the
judge
to
the
findings
was
heard
after
17
days
of
an
initial
hearing,
four
more
days
on
the
issue
of
contact
visits,
two
personal
inspections.
let
me
just
briefly
review
the
factors
which
the
district
judge
found
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
as
being
appropriate
findings.
on
exaggerated
response,
why
the
trial
judge
found
that
this
was
an
exaggerated
response,
the
total
prohibition:
first,
he
found
there
was
testimony
by
corrections
experts
which
revealed
the
existence
of
a
variety
of
adequate
and
tested
security
precautions
available
for
contact
visits.
by
the
way,
mr.
bennett
relies
very
heavily
on
warden
gaston,
who
testified
in
new
york...
in
this
case
in
1978.
as
mr.
bennett
knows,
warden
gaston
was
warden
of
a
facility
in
new
york
for
two
months
and
19
days
in
toto
during
the
very
first
few
months
of
the
experiment
with
contact
visits
in
new
york.
he
had
nothing
upon
which
to
base
any
kind
of
experience
and
testimony,
and
clearly
the
judge
didn't
find
his
testimony
credible.
he
was
only
warden
for
two
months
and
17
days.
the
brief
amicus
of
the
new
york--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--yes,
but
the
brief
of
the
new
york
city
board
of
corrections
indicates
that
last
year
there
were
339,000
contact
visits
involving
an
average
daily
population
of
almost
10,000,
and
they
were
99.95
incident-free.
i
think
that's
much
more
important
testimony
than
what
mr.
gaston
said
in
1978.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
there
is
none.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
except
that
there
were
no
incidents
in
99.95
percent,
no
finding--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
would
concede
that
some
drugs
may
have
come
in
in
some
of
those
visits,
obviously.
but
the
trial
judge
evaluated
all
of
those
things,
based
on
the
expert
testimony.
he
found
that
contact
visits
were
the
norm
in
most
prisoners
and
in
many
detention
facilities.
he
found
that
the
withdrawal
of
contact
visits
was
regularly
used
as
punishment
for
violation
of
a
rule.
he
found
that
the
county
was
able
to
and
it
was
actually
engaged
in
classifying
prisoners
for
risk.
he
found
two
other
things
which
are
very
significant,
because
the
opinion
in
wolfish
states
that
where
you
have
genuine
privation
and
hardship
for
very
extended
periods
of
time,
that
may
raise
a
question
under
the
due
process
clause
about
punishment:
he
found
that
detainees,
some
of
them,
were
there
for
very
extended
periods
of
time;
and
he
found
that
the
denial
of
contact
visits,
particularly
with
close
family,
constituted
genuine
privation
and
hardship.
and
finally,
he
had
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
professional
standards
which
recommended
contact
visits
in
detection
facilities.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
he
was
directed
by
the--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--court
of
appeals
to
hold...
to
consider
it
in
the
light
of
wolfish,
without
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
he
could
have
made
new
findings.
he
did
not.
and
i
will
in
a
moment,
justice
white,
speak
to
i
think
why
he
did
not.
but
just
to
finish
with
the
standards,
we
know
that
this
court
has
often
looked
to
what
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
does
as
being
instructive
of
what
is
professionally
appropriate
and
correct.
well,
the
bureau
of
prisons...
and
i'm
referring
now
to
28
code
of
federal
regulations,
section
540.40
says:
"the
bureau
of
prisons
encourages
visiting
by
family,
friends
and
community
groups
to
maintain
the
morale
of
the
inmate.
"
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no,
that's
generally,
and
now
i'm
going
to
get
to
detainees.
the
next
general
rule
is
in
540.51.g.2:
"staff
shall
permit
limited
physical
contact,
such
as
handshaking,
embracing,
and
kissing,
between
an
inmate
and
a
visitor.
"
and
then
finally,
551.120:
"staff
shall
allow
pretrial
inmates
to
receive
visits
in
accordance
with
the
bureau's
rules.
"
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
a
great
many
drug
crimes,
your
honor.
so
that
is
the
main
concern.
there
are
probably
as
high
a
percentage
of
offenders
in
the
federal
system
with
drug
histories
as
there
are--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--not
that
many.
as
we
all
know,
they
rarely
go
away
to
prison.
most
of
them
get
other
kinds
of
alternative
treatment.
but
today,
as
the
prison
population
of
the
federal
system
has
skyrocketed,
it's
primarily
the
so-called
more
violent,
more
dangerous
offender.
it
is
not
an
increase
in
white
collar
crime.
that's
not
on
the
record,
but
that's
my
own
personal
knowledge.
the
trial
court
had
all
of
these
findings.
it
balanced
the
deprivations
against
the
security
concerns.
and
again
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
determination
of
an
exaggerated
response
to
an
alternative
purpose
is
primarily
a
factual
finding.
and
as
this
court
said
just
a
year
ago
in
pullman
standard
versus
swint,
rule
52
broadly
requires
that
findings
of
fact
not
be
set
aside
unless
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
does
not,
without
more.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
no.
it
invites
the
very
process--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--and
also,
as
wolfish
tells
us,
whether
there
were
genuine
privations
and
hardships
for
very
extended
periods
of
time,
and
whether
the
particular
response
by
the
officials
was
exaggerated
to
the
real
concern
for
security.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
and
illustrative--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--i
don't
think
that's...
i
think
that--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--but
in
context,
if
the
entire
district
court
opinion
is
read,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
he
specifically
follows
wolfish
by
finding
the
exaggerated
response.
even
before
wolfish,
in
february
of
1979,
the
district
court
in
its
first
opinion,
at
petitioner's
appendix
30,
the
district
court
before
wolfish
said,
utilizing...
that
he
would
utilize
the
exaggerated
response
test
set
forth
in
feeley
versus
sampson,
a
first
circuit
case
approved
by
this
court
in
wolfish
at
two
different
points,
rather
than
the
strict
scrutiny
or
compelling
interest
test
of
campbell,
because
it
is
less
burdensome
to
the
custodial
authority.
throughout
these
proceedings,
even
before
wolfish...
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
the
district
court
had
already
anticipated
wolfish,
but
remanded
it
out
of
an
excess
of
caution.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
that
particular
thing
i
think
would
be--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--no.
i
think
the
underlying
factors
that
go
in
to
reach
that
are
findings
of
fact.
the
ultimate
conclusion
is
a
finding,
is
a
mixed
finding,
one
which
i
think
would
be
governed
by
this
court's
decision
in
sumner
versus
matar,
also
a
1982
case.
and
i
think
the
questions
of
fact
that
underlie
the
ultimate
legal
conclusion
are
governed
by
the
presumption
of
correctness.
the
facts
in
pullman
are
very
close
to
this
one,
because
there
this
court
said
that
whether
the
differential
impact
of
a
seniority
system
reflected
an
intent
to
discriminate
was
a
factual
finding,
subject
to
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
here,
whether
there
was
an
intent
to
punish
that
could
be
inferred
i
think
is
similarly
a
factual
issue.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
exaggerated
response.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
don't
think
that
would
be
permissible,
and
that
would
not
satisfy
what
judge
gray
was
concerned
about.
the
heart
of
his
finding
of
deprivation
was
based
on
the
testimony
of
prisoners,
of
experts,
and
all
the
studies
which
show
that
the
barrier
visit,
where
a
person
cannot
touch,
touch
the
hair
of
a
small
child,
put
that
child
on
his
lap,
embrace
for
a
moment,
the
way
the
bureau
of
prisons
permits,
that
that
was
the
real
deprivation.
to
see
through
the
screen
again
is
saying:
your
father
is
an
animal,
you
are
not
allowed
to
touch
that
person.
so
i
don't
think
the
screen
would
suffice.
i
think
the
county
categorically
rejected
any
proposal
like
that
or
any
other
proposal
for
contact
visits...
they
didn't
reject
that
specific
one...
as
the
district
court
found.
and
the
court
found:
"it
is
inescapable
that,
in
the
words
of
the
supreme
court,
the
county's
action
was
excessive
in
relation
to
the
alternative
purpose
of
security
assigned.
"
"the
deprivations
exceeded
the
reasonable
requirements
of
security.
"
"to
deprive
a
prisoner
for
long
periods
of
time
of
any
opportunity
to
embrace
his
wife
or
hug
his
children
is
very
traumatic
treatment,
and
such
treatment
is
not
made
necessary
by
reasonable
security
requirements.
"
"it
constitutes
severe
punishment.
"
as
to
the
rights
specifically
of
wives
and
children,
those
important
familial
rights,
protected
by
the
many
decisions
of
this
court,
those
fundamental
values
we
would
argue
should
be
measured
by
an
even
stricter
test
than
that
which
is
set
forth
under
the
due
process
clause
in
wolfish,
but
under
the
kind
of
test
that
procunier
versus
martinez
suggests:
if
the
complete
elimination
of
the
opportunity
to
touch
their
loved
ones
is
greater
than
necessary
or
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
governmental
interest
involved.
in
closing
on
this
issue,
i
would
just
ask
you
to
visualize,
as
i
think
the
trial
judge
did,
to
visualize
a
person
who
is
a
father
or
a
grandchild
behind
a
glass
wall.
for
months
or
even
years,
you
can
see
but
not
touch
that
child.
i
would
find
that,
as
i
said
earlier,
not
just
punishment;
i
would
find
that
torture.
let
me
turn
very
briefly
to
the
other
issue,
which
i
recognize
at
the
outset
is
a
closer
question,
the
cell
search
issue.
but
let
me
redefine
or
correct
the
impression
that
was
left
earlier
about
what
that
order
says.
it
is
not
an
order
that
says
that
any
prisoner
has
the
right
to
observe
a
cell
search
of
his
cell.
what
it
says
is
that
any
prisoner
who
is
in
the
area
may,
under
these
very
specific
provisions,
observe
the
cell
search.
so
that
a
prisoner
who
is
in
the
dining
room
or
at
recreation
or
out
at
court
or
visiting
and
they
want
to
search
his
cell,
they
don't
have
to
go
get
that
person
and
bring
him
back.
the
protection
was,
if
the
prisoner
happens
to
be
in
the
cell
or
right
on
that
block
of
cells
and
is
there,
then
there
was
this
special
accommodation
to
allow
the
prisoner
to
observe
the
cell
search.
and
this
is
a
procedural
due
process
issue,
as
judge
gray
dealt
with
it,
rather
than
freedom
from
punishment
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process.
and
he
distinguished
from
wolfish,
which
was
decided
basically
on
fourth
amendment
grounds.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
--well,
what
i
think
judge
gray
was
concerned
about
was
his
observations,
his
personal
observations
of
the
likelihood
of
the
loss
of
cherished
possessions:
a
photograph
of
a
deceased
mother,
legal
papers,
a
book
that
was
of
very
great
importance.
he
saw
these
kinds
of
things
happening.
mr.
alvin
j.
bronstein
well,
what
he
found
was
that,
i
think,
that
it
was
not
a
search
and
seizure
question,
but
since
we
have
already
determined
that
a
prisoner
does...
that
the
state
may
not
take
property
without
some
procedural
due
process,
he
found
that
if
those
things
were
taken
there
was
no
adequate
procedural
protection,
such
as
the
damage
claim
mentioned
by
footnote
38
in
wolfish;
and
that
under
parratt
v.
taylor,
which
reaffirms
that
a
state
may
not
take
property
without
some
sort
of
hearing
or,
as
the
court
said
in
parratt,
a
meaningful
hearing
at
a
meaningful
time,
the
only
time
to
do
that
is
in
a
prophylactic
way,
to
prevent
the
taking.
i
think
that
was
his
analysis.
but
he
clearly
limited
it,
i
think
because
of
wolfish,
to
those
prisoners
in
the
immediate
area
of
the
cell
search.
he
did
not
strike
down
the
search
rule
in
its
entirety,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
in
wolfish.
he
found,
after
evidence
and
personal
observation,
that
the
risks
of
improper
confiscation
of
cherished
possessions
was
great
and
could
not
be
redressed
in
any
future
action.
that
was
the
basis
for
his
ruling.
i
submit,
i
agree
that
it
is
a
closer
question
because
the
facts
are
so
close
to
the
wolfish
case.
but
i
think,
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
i
have
set
forth,
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
