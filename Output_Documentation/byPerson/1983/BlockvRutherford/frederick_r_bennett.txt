mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
affirmed
two
injunctive
orders
concerning
operational
aspects
of
the
los
angeles
county
men's
central
jail,
a
5,000
inmate
facility
operated
by
the
sheriff
of
the
county
of
los
angeles.
the
first
order
required
the
sheriff
to
select
up
to
1500
inmates
from
the
5,000
inmate
population
who
he
determined
presented
the
least
likely
opportunity
or
risk
of
escape
or
drug
potential
and
to
permit
them
to
visit
in
a
setting
where
they
could
touch,
kiss
and
embrace
their
visitors,
a
practice
that
has
been
referred
to
in
the
courts
as
contact
visitation.
the
second
order
required
the
sheriff
to
permit
inmates
to
observe
routine
cell
searches
and
to
ask
questions
during
the
searches.
this
is
a
large
jail,
as
a
reflection
of
the
size
of
the
county
of
los
angeles,
which
encompasses
over
4,000
square
miles
and
a
population
approaching
eight
million
people.
that's
roughly
half
the
size
of
the
state
of
maryland,
with
about
twice
that
state's
population.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
no,
the
county
is
4,000
square
miles.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
although
all
male
inmates
are
centralized
at
one
facility,
in
part
because
of
the
size
of
the
county
and
because
of
some
duties
that
are
imposed
upon
the
sheriff
under
state
law.
he
is
required
to
accept
the
prisoners
from
the
police
departments
of
the
82
independent
cities
within
the
county
of
los
angeles.
he
has
no
discretion
to
refuse
them,
and
is
required
to
transport
on
a
daily
basis
one-fifth
of
that
jail's
population
to
26
separate
jurisdictional
courts
located
throughout
the
wide
expanse
of
the
county
and
bring
them
back
again
at
night.
the
jail
has
a
high
turnover.
it
receives
over
200,000
prisoners
a
year.
the
stay
for
most
of
these
is
quite
short
because
of
the
state's
rather
liberal
pretrial
release
statutes,
primarily
with
regard
to
misdemeanants.
most
inmates
stay
within
the
facility
less
than
ten
days.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
longer-term
inmates
within
the
facility.
these
are
primarily
persons
accused
of
more
serious
felonies,
that
are
involved
in
protracted
criminal
process
and
appellate
process,
and
they
may
serve
between
two
and
four
months
or
longer
between
arrest
and
sentencing.
the
court's
order
with
regard
to--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--it
could
be
that.
we
have
really
three
classes
of
prisoners
within
the
jail
as
far
as
are
relevant
here.
many
of
these
inmates
when
they're
arrested
are
picked
up
on
warrants
from
many
of
the
courts
around
the
jurisdiction.
they
may
be
sentenced
on
one
charge,
awaiting
trial
on
another.
the
state
sometimes
leaves
those
sentenced
inmates
with
us
during
some
appellate
processes
before
they
may
be
transferred
to
a
state
prison
facility.
so
it
is
possible,
in
both
appeals
and
writs,
which
is
a
common
practice
in
the
california
courts,
that
they
could
be
involved
in
appellate
process.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
technically,
it
was
certified
as
to
all
prisoners
within
the
jail,
which
at
the
time
of
certification
involved
a
significant
number
of
sentenced
inmates.
now
the
facility
is
predominately
pretrial.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
in
the
progress
of
this
case,
virtually
all
counsel
and
the
courts
at
all
levels
focused
only
on
the
matters
that
dealt
with
pretrial
detainees,
although--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--that's
perhaps
true
as
to
some
issues.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
we
can't
say
how
small,
because
if
an
inmate
is
sentenced
on
one
charge
and
is
a
sentenced
inmate,
but
is
awaiting
trial
on
other
charges,
of
which
there
are
many
within
our
facility,
we
treat
him
for
our
classification
purposes
as
if
he
is
a
pretrial
detainee.
the
court's
order
requiring
us
to
select
up
to
1500
inmates
for
these
contact
visits
is
in
addition
to
the
sheriff's
existing
procedures
to
provide
inmates
an
opportunity
to
maintain
their
personal
relationships,
and
the
sheriff
has
a
three-pronged
plan
and
program
to
accomplish
that.
all
inmates
in
the
jail
have
daily
access
to
telephone
calls,
for
unmonitored
telephone
calls.
there
is
fairly
unrestricted
mail.
and
all
inmates
have
the
daily
opportunity
for
a
non-contact
visit
in
a
setting
where
inmates
and
their
visitors
sit
in
separated
booths
on
either
side
of
a
large
glass
window
and
speak
over
telephones.
in
this
fashion
the
sheriff,
rather
incredibly,
handles
over
2,000
visitors
a
day,
over
63,000
visitors
a
month
at
this
one
facility.
the
sheriff
has
two
concerns
which
led
him
to
adopt
this
three-pronged
plan.
as
the
district
court
noted
and
observed,
the
sheriff
is
committed
to
and
well
recognizes
the
importance
of
permitting
inmates
to
maintain
their
personal
relationships.
at
the
same
time,
the
sheriff
is
also
committed
to
housing
his
prisoners
in
as
safe
a
manner
as
possible
and
free
from
injury.
and
to
accomplish
these
two
goals,
he
has
chosen
this
three-pronged
plan
of
daily
telephone
calls,
unrestricted
mail,
and
non-contact
visits
because
it
maximizes
the
frequency
of
the
opportunity
to
maintain
these
personal
relationships,
while
at
the
same
time
minimizing
the
risks
involved.
and
it's
fairly
obvious
why
there's
no
risk
under
this
plan.
the
visitors
never
enter
the
security
of
the
facility,
the
inmates
never
leave
it.
there
is
no
opportunity
to
pass
contraband.
because
of
this
and
in
this
fashion,
this
large
number
of
visitors
can
be
easily
handled
with
minimal
risk
and
without
intrusive
security
measures
associated
with
most
other
types
of
visitation:
no
strip
searches,
no
appointments,
no
screening,
no
limitation
on
the
visitors
that
you
can
see
or
their
names...
without
any
of
those
intrusive
measures.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
they
did
not
make
that
request.
unlike
some
district
court
cases
concerning
other
jails
where
the
phones
were
always
inoperative
and
people
had
to
scream
back
and
forth
to
be
heard,
i
think
the
record
reflects
that
this
is
a
fairly
modern
visitation
facility,
with
well-maintained
telephones.
the
thrust
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
was
contact
visits,
permitting
kissing,
touching
and
embracing,
and
not
so
much
the
fact
that
one
had
to
communicate
over
the
telephone.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
yes,
it
did.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
well,
i
think
that
the
new
york
facility
is
certainly
different
from
ours.
even
though
it's
maybe
the
second
or
third
largest
jail
in
the
country,
ours
is
more
than
twice
its
size,
with
unique
problems
that
make
it
quite
different.
plus,
administrators
place
different
priorities
on
things
within
their
own
circumstances
and
exercise
a
different
level
of
prudence.
i
think
the
most
telling
evidence
in
this
case
was
the
testimony
of
warden
gaston
of
the
ryker's
island
facility,
who
was
the
warden
of
their
largest
jail
that
had
permitted
contact
visits
for
a
number
of
years.
he
said
two
things:
one,
he
did
not
see
how
we
could
permit
contact
visitations
within
our
existing
facility;--
and
two,
that
if
contact
visitation
was
required
in
our
facility,
that
he
didn't
want
to
be
the
manager
of
it.
contact
visits--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--i'd
like
to
focus
on
two
aspects:
one,
our
drug
problem;
and
then
the
drug
problem,
for
instance,
at
new
york
jails
which
permit
contact
visits.
we
do
have
a
drug
problem.
within
our
jail
are
probably
as
large
a
group
of
drug-oriented
gangs
that
are
organized
to
control
drug
trafficking
within
the
jail
through
threats
and
violence,
more
than
you'll
find
in
any
other
facility
in
the
country.
drugs
do
exist
in
our
facility,
because
we
can't
control
the
inmates
at
court,
they
can
be
hidden
in
packages
in
mail,
and
that
is
a
problem
within
our
facility.
significantly,
at
the
new
york
facility,
if
we
listen
to
warden
gaston
from
ryker's
island,
when
they
permit
contact
visits
he's
found
that
the
most
prevalent
use
is
the
use
of
a
balloon,
that
is
swallowed...
that
is
passed
through
a
kiss
and
swallowed
to
retrieve
later.
he
pointed
out
that
their
drug
problem
was
so
pervasive
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
these
empty
balloons
have
clogged
up
their
sewer
system.
contact
visitation
i
think
presents
a
unique
and
unavoidable
opportunity
for
serious
and
genuine
breaches
of
a
facility's
security.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
well,
the
court
certainly
thought
it
applied
to
up
to
1500.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
but
that
number,
in
terms
of
total
inmates
that
meet
the
30-day
requirement,
would
exceed
that
number.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
we
don't
think
that
we
can
segregate
them
within
our
facility
or
classify
them
as
to
those
types
of
risks.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
we
do.
in
fact,
the
new
york
people
who
came
out
and
testified
said
we
had
the
finest
classification
system
that
they
had
seen
in
examining
all
of
those.
but
it's
a
classification
system
designed
to
house
inmates
by
compatibility
within
a
secure
facility,
which
is
our
main
job
at
this
point.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
even
if
we
can
segregate
out
those
who
might
present
the
lesser
risk
of
drugs
or
escape,
we
can't
prevent
the
intermingling
within
our
facility.
all
or
many
activities
within
our
jail
are
centralized:
medical
care,
meals,
recreation,
law
library,
school.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
i
think
it
was
apparent
to
us
that
the
court
expected
us
to
find
at
least
1500
people--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--i
can't
say.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
although
i
would
indicate
that,
in
light
of
our
sheriff's
history
as
reflected
in
the
record,
that
he
would
make
an
effort
to
try
and
find
1500
people
if
he
could.
the
problem--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--i
think
it's
a
reflection
of
this
sheriff
who,
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
tried,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
told
to
him
that
he
had
to
do
something,
he
would
make
an
effort
to
do
that.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
i
can't
tell
you.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
no,
i
can't.
but
you've
pointed
out
one
problem,
that
we
can't
prevent
the
intermixing
of
inmates,
even
if
we
could
separate
them
by
classification.
not
only
the
centralized
activities,
but
this
incredible
logistics
task
of
pulling
out,
sometimes
with
an
order
telling
you
who
it
is
only
the
night
before
and
which
court
he's
going
to
only
the
night
before,
1,000
inmates,
one-fifth
of
the
jail's
population,
that
have
to
be
commingled
by
court
destination
and
transported
out
to
these
courts
and
brought
back
again
at
night
on
a
daily
basis.
the
significance
of
that
is
that
even
if
you
found
some
inmates
that
could
be
trustworthy,
and
no
doubt
there
are
many,
that
you
can't
preclude
the
use
of
coercion
and
threats
by
those
with
a
compulsion
to
obtain
the
drugs
to
coerce
these
people
permitted
contact
visits
to
do
their
deeds
for
them.
and
these
prison
drug
trafficking-oriented
gangs
are
a
major
problem
in
that
respect.
but
i
think
another
thing
about
contact
visitation
that
we
have
to
think
about
is
that
the
necessary
security
measures
for
it
are
very
intrusive
and
have
adverse
effects
on
the
inmates.
justice
marshall
well
pointed
out
that
these
strip
searches,
which
are
almost
universally
determined
to
be
necessary
with
contact
visitation,
may
themselves
have
adverse
psychological
impact
upon
the
inmate,
that
they're
certainly
degrading,
and
that
they
may
present
the
potential--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--that's
true.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
they
don't.
also,
contact
visitation
is
more
protracted,
time
consuming,
and
personnel
intensive.
it
may
limit
the
number
of
non-contact
visits
that
we
can
permit
to
other
inmates,
and
may
take
immediate
personnel
away
from
other
important
duties
within
the
jail.
finally,
the
jail
was
not
designed
for
contact
visitation,
and
if
we
were
forced
to
try
and
deal
with
such
an
order
it's
clear
that
rather
expensive
and
complex
additional
construction
would
be
required.
two
decades
of
prisoner'
rights
litigation
have
taught
us
that
the
problems
of
jails
are
difficult
and
intractable
and
not
easily
solved
by
judicial
decree,
and
this
is
because
they
involve
sensitive
judgments
concerning
the
confinement
of
people
against
their
will,
to
many
of
whom
violence
is
no
stranger,
and
where
the
compulsion
to
obtain
narcotics
and
other
contraband
may
override
rationality,
and
most
importantly,
were
the
cost
of
miscalculation
may
be
human
life
in
its
forfeit
instant.
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
with
the
search
procedures.
we've
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
at
length--
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
--i
don't
think
the
mere
question
of
contact
visits
rises
to
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
then
the
answer
is
it's
not
punishment,
given
the
other
alternatives
that
are
available
to
permit
the
maintenance
of
these
relationships.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
i
think
i
would
have
to
take
that
position.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
the
search
procedures,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
briefs,
are
really
not
very
distinguishable
from
this
court's
prior
examination
of
that
question
in
the
wolfish
decision.
in
fact,
our
district
court
relied
in
haec
verba
on
the
very
reasoning
and
analysis
of
judge
frankel
that
was
rejected
in
that
case.
that's
as
close
as
you
can
come,
i
think,
to
not
being
able
to
distinguish
a
case.
but
one
thing
about
searches
that
may
trouble
some
members
of
the
court,
the
district
court
here
focused
on
but
one
aspect
and
certainly
the
less
important
aspect
of
a
dual
purpose
search.
the
primary
purpose
of
these
searches
is
to
locate
weapons
and
drugs
and
contraband.
it
turns
out,
because
of
matter
of
convenience,
we
also
do
a
housekeeping
function
with
it.
the
guards
go
through,
they
remove
the
excess
food
for
sanitation
purposes.
they
take
out
the
excess
newspapers
and
magazines
because
that
presents
a
fire
hazard
in
great
quantity.
they
take
the
jail-issued
clothing
that
is
in
large
number,
the
extra
pair
of
pants,
the
multiple
blankets
and
towels,
and
recycle
them
back
into
the
system.
these
are
severable
functions,
although
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
do
them
separately.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
seizure
of
the
magazines
or
the
newspapers
or
the
like,
that's
part
of
the
housekeeping
function.
our
security
concerns
devote
primarily
to
the
hunt
for
contraband
and
weapons.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
frederick
r.
bennett
i'd
like
to
direct
my
attention
just
briefly
to
this
39-month
inmate,
because
it
may
cause
some
concern
to
some
members
of
the
court.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that's
a
routine
or
other
than
an
exception.
and
i
point
out
that
every
one
of
these
pretrial
inmates
is
before
a
judge
in
a
pending
criminal
case,
which
regularly
makes
orders
concerning
confinement
and
the
treatment
of
that
prisoner
during
trial.
what's
significant
about
that
is
one
portion
of
the
record
that's
easy
to
overlook,
and
it's
set
forth
on
page
62
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
was
a
fact
stipulated
to
between
the
parties
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation,
and
it
reads:
"physical
contact
between
prisoners
and
visitors
is
not
routinely
permitted.
"
not
routinely
permitted.
we
do
get
orders
from
judges
in
cases
that
are
particularly
protracted,
that
are
handled
on
a
one
on
one
basis,
which
is
manageable
within
our
facility.
in
fact,
i'm
not
sure
if
it
appears
in
the
transcript
or
not,
but
i
was
there.
judge
gray
himself
ordered
some
such
visits.
i
can't
remember
if
it
dealt
with
mr.
rutherford
himself,
but
with
regard
to
one
inmate
who
made
such
a
request.
in
conclusion,
we
do
argue
that
the
court
as
a
matter
of
law
should
not
find
contact
visits
constitutionally
required;
given
the
unavoidable
risks,
given
the
availability
of
relatively
risk-free
alternatives,
that
the
court
should
not
find
that
a
court
is
warranted
in
substituting
its
judgment
either
for
the
jailer
who
operates
that
jail
or
for
the
local
and
state
officials
and
government
for
which
they
work.
new
york
is
a
prime
example.
it
has
gone
far
beyond
constitutional
mandates
and
has
indicated
that
that
may
occur.
with
regard
to
the
findings,
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
i
don't
think
the
findings
of
the
court
support
either
its
conclusions
or
the
position
of
the
inmates.
it's
clear
when
you
compare
the
three
decisions
that
the
court
merely
substituted
its
perception
of
what
was
reasonable
for
that
of
the
sheriff.
when
you
look
at
the
first
initial
decision,
the
court
looked
at
two
different
tests:
a
compelling
necessity
test
that
came
out
of
the
new
york
courts,
which
required
strict
scrutiny;
and
it
then
looked
at
the
reasonably
necessary
test,
which
came
out
of
another
circuit.
and
it
said
even
then,
between
those
two
tests,
at
the
petition
appendix
page
30,
that
even
those
two
tests
were
the
same,
that
only
they
differed
in
theoretical
analysis,
but
the
result
was
the
same.
still
a
balancing
test.
when
you
get
to
the
final
decision
after
remand
after
wolfish,
the
court
no
longer
talks
about
the
compelling
necessity
test,
but
he
talks
about
his
prior
test
and
he
says,
even
the
test
of
wolfish
and
what
i
did
before
is
the
same,
that
really...
and
that
was
at
the
appendix
25.
whether
you're
talking
about
the
compelling
necessity
test,
strict
scrutiny,
the
reasonably
necessary
test,
or
the
test
of
wolfish,
the
court
says,
i
read
the
tests
the
same
and
the
result
is
the
same.
and
what
that
tells
us
is
that
the
court
worked
in
reverse
order.
he
first
looked
at
his
perception
of
what
was
an
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
permitting
inmates
to
maintain
personal
relationships,
and
worked
backwards
to
try
to
make
the
test
fit
that
result.
and
really,
the
one
thing
that
wolfish
tells
us
is
that
you
go
in
reverse
order.
you
first
look
at
the
determination
of
the
jailer
or
of
the
local
entity
or
state
government
for
which
he
works,
and
you
examine
his
choice
of
the
range
of
reasonable
solutions
and
see
if
it
is
sufficiently
related
to
legitimate
government
goals
that
it's
not
punishment
and
thus
constitutionally
permissible.
and
with
that,
i
will
submit.
