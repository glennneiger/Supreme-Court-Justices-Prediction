unknown
speaker
mr.
garrett,
would
suggest
that
we
would
be
ratifying
what
someone
else
has
already
said
is
correct.
who
is
that
someone
else?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
track
what
you
mean
when
you
say
private
defamation.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
it
the
other
way
around,
that
there
is
some
concept
that
a
private
party
does
not
share
all
the
protections
that
all
other
persons
share
under
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
result
of
any
limitation.
that's
the
result
of
the
basic
state
general
damage
award.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
saying
the
reasons
why
we
should
have
this
limitation
on
the
states'
authority
are
two,
and
one
is
the
state
ought
to
do
what
it
isn't
limited
to
do
by
this
limitation.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
are
these
damage
awards
so
much
different
than
awards
in
personal
injury
cases?
they're
all
going
up
nowadays.
why
shouldn't
they
go
up
against
libel
defendants,
too?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
prove
the
element
of
damage?
unknown
speaker
your
client
isn't
exactly
in
the
position
of
the
new
york
times
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan,
where
the
court
talks
about
the
dangers
of
self-censorship
and
that
sort
of
thing.
really,
no
great
social
harm
would
be
done
if
dun
&
bradstreet
did
a
little
self-censorship
when
it
comes
to
defaming
people's
business
reputations,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
know
what?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
creditor
wouldn't
corroborate?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
is
that
really
more
important
than
making
sure
someone
in
the
respondent's
position
here
isn't
false
accused
of
having
filed
bankruptcy?
unknown
speaker
but
the
jury
was
also
told
that
they
had
to
find
malice
or
lack
of
good
faith
to
find
any
damages
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make?
they
were
instructed.
that
was
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
lesser.
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
nothing.
go
ahead.
well,
that's
part
of
the
issue
in
the
case,
is
what
kind
of
malice
you
have
to
show
to
justify
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
was
dun
&
bradstreet
requested
to
make
a
retraction
and
did
they
do
anything
about
it?
unknown
speaker
did
they
go
the
whole
way?
unknown
speaker
did
dun
&
bradstreet
let
them
know
who
were
the
recipients
of
the
original
false
information?
unknown
speaker
they
declined
to
give
it
to
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be
improper
for
a
jury
to
infer
malice
from
their
refusal
to
let
greenmoss
know
who
received
the
original
false
report?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garrett,
as
long
as
you're
interrupted,
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
unknown
speaker
there
are
federal
laws
in
the
securities
fields,
such
as
section
10(b)(5),
that
govern
statements
that
are
made
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
securities.
do
you
think
there's
a
first
amendment
right
for
people
who
are
publishing
information
about
securities
that
has
to
be
considered
every
time
we
have
a
10(b)(5)
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
asking
us
to
recognize
a
first
amendment
right
here
in
connection
with
the
dun
&
bradstreet
type
of
publication,
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
wouldn't
lead
us
to
having
to
recognize
first
amendment
rights
in
a
10(b)(5)
situation
or
an
ordinary
fraud
situation,
anything?
unknown
speaker
mr.
garrett,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
there?
you
seem
to
treat
the
case
as
though
there
are
two
kinds
of
speakers,
media
speakers
and
non-media
speakers.
you're
in
the
non-media
category
and
you
get
all
of
that.
but
yet,
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
you
got
a
special
instruction
for
the
privilege
for
credit
reporting
agencies,
which
kind
of
suggests
maybe
you're
in
a
special
narrow
category.
up
here
your
opponent
argues,
yes,
you're
in
a
narrow
category
and
you
don't
get
all
the
benefits
of
other
non-media
people.
would
you
kind
of
comment
on
how
much
you
think
you're
typical
of
non-media
defendants
generally?
you
see,
they
also
say
this
is
commercial
speech
and
it's
not
something
distributed
at
large,
that
you
don't
need
robust
debate
on
whether
somebody
went
into
bankruptcy
or
not.
it's
kind
of
a
different,
specialized
area.
unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
there
was
no
evidence?
did
you
suggest
that
before
you
got
here,
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
told,
though,
that
they
had
to
find
malice
or
absence
of
good
faith,
right?
unknown
speaker
they
never
defined
"malice"
in
the
new
york
times
standard
or
manner?
unknown
speaker
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
request
for
a
definition?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
special
request
for
a
definition
instruction?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
request?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
garrett,
i
gather
the
report
was
false.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you
felt
you
were
entitled
to
was
an
instruction
that
your
client
was
not
to
be
liable
unless
it
published
the
falsehood
knowing
it
was
false,
right,
or
with
reckless
disregard
to
whether
it
was
true
or
false?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
still
don't
understand.
what
is
the
form
of
new
york
times
instruction
you
thought
you
were
entitled
to?
unknown
speaker
only
in
relation
to
the
punitive
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
compensatory
damages
what
type
of
instruction
satisfied
you?
unknown
speaker
damages.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
wouldn't...
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'm
still
lost.
you
said
once
or
twice
you
thought
that
there
should
have
been
no
damage
award
whatever,
except
under
instructions
that
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
actual
damage.
well,
that's
gertz,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede
that
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
at
least
you
concede
liability,
you
concede
falsity
and
you
concede
fault?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
and
new
york
times
is
not
involved
in
that.
unknown
speaker
then
it's
just
the
question
of
damages,
that
you
think
you're
entitled
to
the
new
york
times
malice
instruction
if
you're
going
to
presume
damages
or
give
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
gertz
said
about
media
defendants.
at
least
that's
what
gertz
said
about
defendants,
and
it
happens
to
be
that
a
media
was
defendant
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
are
a
publisher.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
a
media.
you
are
a
medium.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garrett,
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
brennan
and
justice
white
you
stated
what
instructions
you
thought
you
were
entitled
to
under
your
theory,
constitutional
theory
of
the
case.
did
you
request
these
instructions
from
the
superior
court
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
want
to
rephrase
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't
vermont
follow
the
rule
that
most
other
states
follow,
that
if
you
want
a
particular
instruction
on
a
question
you
have
to
submit
it
to
the
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
did
you
submit
a
request
for
instruction?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
it
you
asked
him
to
instruct?
unknown
speaker
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
"please
charge
it
this
way"?
what's
"this
way"?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
actual
request?
unknown
speaker
are
you
challenging
the
$50,000
of
actual
damages
found
by
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
on
what
grounds?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
go
another
step:
and
that
they
didn't
prove
damages.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
prove
that,
too?
unknown
speaker
if
the
evidence
showed
that
the
man
called
up
a
man
and
said,
i
hate
this
stinker
and
he
just
went
into
bankruptcy,
i
take
it
you'd
give
him
damages
without
a
charge?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--your
brief
refers
to
$50,000
compensatory
damages.
that's
a
curious
way
to
describe
presumed
damages.
unknown
speaker
the
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you
is,
all
of
the
new
york
times
and
gertz
formulas
all
focus
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
defamation
occurred,
at
the
time
here
we
know
there
was
a
falsehood.
would
you
say
that
there's
anything
in
the
new
york
times
line
of
cases
that
would
prevent
the
state
of
vermont
assessing
punitive
damages
for
your
conduct
after
the
libel
occurred,
when
you
refused
to
give
the
names
of
the
five
people
who
received
it,
which
might
have
enabled
him
to
go
out
and
check
it
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
their
theory,
as
i
understood
it,
their
theory
of
malice
emphasized,
their
arguments
to
the
jury
and
the
like,
emphasized
this
conduct
as
a
reason
for
making
you
pay
a
heavy
damage
award.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
the
first
amendment
allow
that?
because
i
can
see
how
that
would
be
quite
important
to
a
businessman,
to
go
around
and
straighten
out
his
reputation
with
all
these
people.
unknown
speaker
but
does
that
immunize?
if
two
weeks
later
he
goes
out
and
does
a
lot
of
other
stuff
that's
related
to
it
and
is
very
harmful
to
the
plaintiff,
is
that
also
immunized
by
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
i
haven't
seen
a
case
quite
like
this
before.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
here
you
did
know
and
it
was
a
handful
and
it
could
easily
have
been
given
and
it
would
have
made
a
lot
of
difference,
i
suppose,
to
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
so
maybe
punitive
damages
do
accomplish
something
once
in
a
while.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
a
juror
sitting
in
the
box
couldn't
say
to
himself
and
to
the
other
jurors,
their
attitude
after
the
original
defamation,
afterward,
relates
back
and
shows
that
the
state
of
mind
all
the
way
through
was
one
of
malice?
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
vermont
supreme
court
address
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
it
was
raised
in
the
trial
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
vermont
court
decided
it.
unknown
speaker
they
decided
the
issue
and
that's
what
the
argument
is
here,
is
whether
the
vermont
court
was
right
or
not--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
whether
gertz
applies.
unknown
speaker
you're
suggesting
that
this
kind
of
speech
can
certainly
libel,
but
you
think
the
first
amendment
is
just
irrelevant,
that
this
kind
of
speech
just
doesn't
deserve
first
amendment
protection?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
protect
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
did
he
draw
a
distinction
between
commercial
speech
and
other
speech
when
he
wrote
that
dissent?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't
the
gist
of
his
dissent,
however,
that
there
should
be
no
distinction?
unknown
speaker
was
he
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
valentine
against
christianson
has
been
eroded
substantially,
hasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
he
was
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
say
that
what
this
poses
is
commercial
speech,
that's
all,
therefore
it
has
no
first
amendment
effects?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
your
position,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
view
of
the
development
of
the
law
about
commercial
speech
and
the
movement
toward
limiting
it
to
advertising,
would
it
make
sense
to
try
to
draw
a
distinction
between
public
speech
and
private
speech
instead?
unknown
speaker
did
you
present
this
argument
to
the
vermont
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
argued
it
was
commercial
speech.
but
did
you
go
on
and
argue
this
is
commercial
speech,
it
deserves
no
protection
because
it's
false?
unknown
speaker
and
the
way
they
responded,
that
isn't
the
issue
they
responded
to?
unknown
speaker
they
responded
to
the
argument
about
the
applicability
of
gertz.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
presenting
this
as
an
alternate
grounds
for
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
ad
in
the
new
york
times
case,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
heilmann,
supposing
they
had
a
credit
rating
and
said,
we
now
give
this
company
a
credit
rating
of
c
instead
of
b,
reason,
bankruptcy
filed.
so
that
you
then
have
a
message
and
then
a
false
fact
in
support
of
it.
unknown
speaker
some
of
these
things
are--
unknown
speaker
--the
message
would
be
his
credit
isn't
too
good
any
more.
unknown
speaker
i
know
in
this
particular
report
it's
kind
of
a
one-fact
special
report.
but
it
seems
to
me
very
often
these
reports
have
a
lot
of
facts
in
them,
and
you
might
have
one
of
them
false
and
a
lot
of
others
that
are
not
false,
and
the
conclusion
that's
doubtful.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
if
you're
right
about
your
commercial
speech
ground
you
never
get
to
all
this
other
argument.
unknown
speaker
because
i
guess
you
rely
on
the
first
requirement
for
constitutional
protection
that
the
court
suggested
in
central
hudson.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
there's
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
suppression
of
commercial
messages
that
do
not
accurately
inform
the
public.
unknown
speaker
and
if
it's...
you
say
that
if
it's
conceded
this
report
was
false,
they
have
conceded
themselves
out
of
first
amendment
protection.
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
commercial
speech.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
we
agree
with
that
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
yes.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
mr.
garrett
that
there's
no
evidence
at
all
about
damages?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
evidence?
would
you
mind
giving
me,
not
too
much,
but
just--
unknown
speaker
--how
big
was
the
loan?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
put
in
evidence?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
do
you
think
that
gertz
applies
at
all
in
this?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
wouldn't
need
to
prove
fault,
either?
unknown
speaker
you
just
go
under
traditional
libel
law?
unknown
speaker
once
you've
proved
falsity
and
the
kind
of
libel
that
justifies
damages,
then
the
jury
is
free
to
presume?
unknown
speaker
mr.
heilmann,
were
the
instructions
given
given
at
your
request?
unknown
speaker
one
other
point.
the
argument
was
made
here
about
dun
&
bradstreet
had
a
lot
of
similar
points
with
a
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
was
it
argued
below?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
instructions,
before
we
lose
it.
the
instruction
on
the
qualified
privilege
of
a
credit
reporting
agency
that
was
given,
was
that
given
at
your
opponent's
request
over
your
objection?
unknown
speaker
but
you
objected
to
that
charge?
unknown
speaker
did
not
gertz
say
that
included
within
actual
damages
could
be
injury
to
reputation?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
for
an
instruction
along
those
lines?
unknown
speaker
you
may
lose
your
reputation
with
respect
to
paying
your
debts.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
they're
that
hard-headed
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question.
i
think
you're
getting
to
your
end.
take
your
opponent's
hypothetical
of
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation
that
has
a
column
on
the
back:
recent
legal
developments,
subhead
bankruptcies,
and
they
mistakenly
say
your
company
went
into
bankruptcy,
the
same
facts.
what
happens
with
that?
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
you're
saying
a
different
rule
would
apply
to
that
case
than
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
in
justice
stevens'
question
i
thought
he
did
give
you
a
hypothetical
where
the
newspaper
published
a
fact
somewhat
separately
from
its
editorial
and
news
coverage.
and
i
think
his
question
was
what
should
be
the
rule
in
that
case
as
to
the
newspaper.
unknown
speaker
if
you
won't
answer
it
for
him,
will
you
answer
it
for
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
just
arguing
you'll
win
under
the
actual
malice
standard,
so
you
can
go
ahead
and
retry
the
case
and
you'll
still
win.
that's
what
you're
really
saying
now,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
is
really
should
the
same
standard
apply
to
the
two
papers,
and
i
think
you
say
no.
unknown
speaker
you've
answered
it.
do
you
think
you
would
give
a
$75,000
punitive
damage
against
a
local
newspaper?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
net
result
if
you
go
back
to
the
gertz
case
is
you
may
end
up
with
more
money,
even
after
a
second
trial.
unknown
speaker
it
could
happen
here,
too,
because
there's
no
north
carolina
against
pierce
problem,
i
guess,
in
this
area
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
10:00.
