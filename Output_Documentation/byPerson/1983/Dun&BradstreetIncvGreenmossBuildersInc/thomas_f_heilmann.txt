mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
was
not
until
2:30
this
afternoon
that
we
heard
for
the
first
time
that
dun
&
bradstreet
claims
that
it
is
a
media
defendant.
they
never
suggested
that
in
this
case
before.
so,
in
response
to
your
question,
this
case
came
to
the
court
as
a
non-media
defendant
case,
and
they
never
asserted
a
media
defendant
position
below.
the
questions
that
you
asked
about
the
facts
i
think
raise
some
serious
questions
about
just
what
went
on
here
and
i
think
show
why
the
gertz
formula
should
not
be
used
in
this
type
of
litigation.
you
asked
the
question,
did
they
retract
the
whole
way?
well,
that
was
a
major
part
of
the
trial
in
this
case.
contrary
to
what's
been
said
to
you,
in
this
case
what
happened
was,
after
our
client
found
out
about
the
false
report
of
bankruptcy
they
asked
to
find
out
who
the
report
was
submitted
to
so
that
they
could
engage
in
what
gertz
says
is
the
first
remedy
of
a
defamed
plaintiff,
self-help.
and
they
couldn't
get
the
answers
to
those
very
simple
questions
until
the
lawsuit
was
filed
and
until
discovery
was
submitted.
so
greenmoss
found
itself
in
the
position
of
knowing
that
this
information
was
being
disseminated,
but
not
knowing
to
whom
and
not
knowing
the
breadth
of
the
dissemination.
and
as
the
trial
indicated,
as
the
president
of
the
company
testified
at
length,
he
had
a
bizarre
problem.
every
customer
that
he
visited
with,
he
would
not
know
whether
that
customer
had
heard
about
the
bankruptcy.
so
he
was
forced
into
the
awkward
position
of
saying:
do
you
know
that
we're
not
bankrupt?
that's
a
very
extraordinary
position
for
a
businessman
to
find
himself
in.
so
i
think
it
is
a
whole
course
of
conduct.
that's
the
way
this
case
was
tried.
and
with
respect
to
whether
gertz
was
raised
at
the
trial
court
level,
we
submitted
some
extensive
information
to
the
court
in
our
brief
about
the
fact
that
gertz
was
not
properly
raised.
in
this
case,
the
common
law
privilege
was
an
open
question
in
vermont
and
that
appeared
to
be
all
that
dun
&
bradstreet
wanted.
they
only
suggested
gertz
as,
in
their
words,
"a
second
rationale"
behind
the
protection
that
common
law
extended.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
they
addressed
it.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--that's
right.
but
it
poses
one
of
the
difficulties
of
getting
a
clean
record
to
really
answer
the
questions
here.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
that
the
issue
is
properly
framed.
what
we
really
think
this
case
is
about
is
credit
reports,
and
we
think
that
these
credit
reports,
which
involve
only
statements
of
fact,
which
are
made
exclusively
in
the
business
and
financial
arena,
come
within
the
definition
and
description
of
what
this
court
has
called
commercial
speech.
this
case
does
not
present
the
difficult
questions
that
other
commercial
speech
cases
have
presented,
because
we
don't
have
speech,
commercial
or
otherwise,
on
public
issues,
and
we
don't
have
speech
that
involves
the
total
suppression
in
advance
of
speech.
i
think
common
sense
is
the
first
test
that
you
can
utilize
in
looking
at
credit
reports
as
commercial
speech,
and
common
sense
has
led
virtually
all
of
the
lower
federal
courts...
in
fact,
in
one
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
clark...
to
say
that
commercial
credit
reports,
in
fact
the
same
reports
that
are
in
this
case
and
the
exact
same
defendant,
are
commercial
speech.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i'm
saying
it's
commercial
speech
and
you
use--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--because
under
the
commercial
speech
doctrine
the
first
test
is
truth
or
falsity
or
misleading,
and
then
in
this
case
it
clearly
is
false
and
misleading.
there
is
no
such
tort
as
the
tort
of
outrageous
commercial
speech.
commecial
speech
gets
to
the
court
in
various
contexts.
in
one
case
it
was
the
suspension
of
a
lawyer
to
practice
law,
the
arala
case
and
the
primus
case,
that
raised
the
commercial
speech
question.
in
the
last
case
that
the
court
handled,
the
bolger
case,
it
was
the
circulation
of
family
planning
information
that
raised
commercial
speech.
as
i've
indicated,
mr.
justice
clark,
writing
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
millstone-o'hanlan
case,
a
commercial
credit
reporting
case,
said
this
is
commercial
speech.
in
fact,
even
in
the
case
that
dun
&
bradstreet
relies
upon,
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
from
grove
versus
dun
&
bradstreet's
denial
of
certiorari,
mr.
justice
douglas
says
this
is
commercial
speech.
the
key
here...
i
think
the
two
qualities
that
make
this
commercial
speech
is
that--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--he
wanted
to
see
what
level
of
constitutional
protection,
if
any,
commercial
speech
should
receive.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
think
that's
what
his
position
was,
but
he
wanted
the
court
as
a
group
of
nine
justices
to
handle
that
question.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
in
this
case
the
qualities
that
make
commercial
speech
commercial
speech
are
the
fact
that
it's
fact-based
information
combined
with
information
solely
about
business.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
we
don't
mean
to
suggest--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--well,
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
just
because
speech
is
commercial
speech
that
it
does
not
have
any
constitutional
protection.
in
the
bolger
case,
a
substantial
degree
of
constitutional
protection
is
afforded
to
commercial
speech.
but
the
way
to
handle
issues
like
this
is
to
call
it
commercial
speech.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
if
this
isn't
commercial
speech
and
the
large
body
of
precedent
in
the
lower
courts
are
wrong,
then
i
think
the
message
that
will
be
delivered
by
the
greenmoss
case
is
that
commercial
speech
doctrine
applies
only
to
commercial
advertising
and
activity
like
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
if
that's
so
i
question
whether
the
government
will
lose
its
power
to
regulate,
by
content
or
otherwise,
a
whole
gamut
of
"commercial
speech".
in
other
words,
will
a
consumer
credit
agency
say
that
the
rules
under
the
consumer
credit
reporting
act
are
unenforceable
because
of
the
free
speech
clause?
will
licensing
of
doctors
and
lawyers
raise
full
freedom
of
speech?
i
suggest
that
companies
like
dun
&
bradstreet
will
come
in
in
those
contexts,
your
honor,
and
say,
all
we
want...
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
dun
&
bradstreet
brief
here...
"is
the
limited
protection
that
you
gave
people
in
gertz.
"
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that
may
be
a
possibility,
your
honor.
i
think
in
this
case
the
real
issue...
i
think
it
is
commercial
speech.
but
the
real
issue
when
everything
is
moved
away
is,
do
presumed
and
punitive
damages
unreasonably
chill
this
type
of
speech?
without
necessarily
getting
involved
in--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--yes,
we
did.
we
argued
that
this
was
commercial
speech
before
the
vermont
supreme
court.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
that's
what
we
said.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
no,
the
court
didn't
address
that
issue.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
yes.
even
apart
from
the
commercial
speech
question
in
this
case,
i
think
the
type
of
speech
that's
involved
raises
a
very
fundamental
reason
why
the
gertz
doctrine
is
inapplicable.
to
me
there
has
always
been
something
hollow
about
what
dun
&
bradstreet
is
asking
the
court
to
do
here,
and
i
think
when
all
the
rhetoric
is
removed
what
dun
&
bradstreet
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
apply
new
york
times
and
gertz
to
protections
for
concededly
false
statements
of
fact,
which
statements
stand
totally
and
exclusively
by
themselves.
the
facts
here
are
not
made
in
support
of
or
associated
with
any
thesis.
they
are
not
made
to
advance
any
idea.
this
is
a
different
type
of
situation
than
the
court
had
in
gertz.
but
in
gertz
you
said
that
a
false
fact
without
more
has
absolutely
no
constitutional
protection.
well,
here
the
entire
conceptual
structure
of
these
credit
reports
is
only
grounded
in
fact.
their
usefulness
is
directly
and
exclusively
tied
to
their
accuracy.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
no,
i
don't
think
you
can,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
message
there.
there
is
no
message
here.
the
efficacy
and
the
total
intrinsic
value
of
this
speech
depends
only
on
its
factual
nature.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
i
have
trouble
with--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--i
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
determining
what,
if
any,
that
message
would
be.
there's
really
no
thesis
that
a
company
like
dun
&
bradstreet--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--but
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
thesis
we're
talking
about.
i
think
there
is
really
no
thesis
in
that
type
of
analysis.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
to
follow
up
what
you
said
earlier,
this
may
be
a
very
rare
situation.
this
may
be
the
only
type
of
case
dealing
with
just
credit
reports
about
facts,
that
you
have
to
analyze
what
was
said
in
gertz
and
the
other
cases
about
facts
standing
alone.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
we
do,
and
it's
never
been--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
yes,
because--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--not
only
because
it's
commercial
speech.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
think
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
no,
i
don't.
my
name
is
heilmann,
your
honor.
mr.
garrett
argued
for
dun
&
bradstreet.
i
don't
agree
that
there's
no
evidence
of
damages
at
all.
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--i'll
give
you
just
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
what
happened.
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
that
the
bank
that
our
client
had
done
business
with
for
many
years
received
the
bankruptcy
report
and,
in
close
proximate
time
thereafter,
not
only
told
our
client
to
take
a
particular
loan
request
that
was
on
the
table
elsewhere,
but
to
take
the
entire
banking--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--the
loan
i
think
was
for
$20,000.
we
had
about
$96,000
in
other
loans
with
that
bank.
and
that
bank
received
the
dun
&
bradstreet
report
and
shortly
thereafter
asked
our
client
to
go
elsewhere.
we
went
elsewhere.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that
was
put
in
evidence,
your
honor.
additionally,
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
about
the
compensatory
damage
award
here
is
that
i
don't
think
presumed
damages
have
any
application
at
all
on
what
i
call
the
compensatory
damage
award.
number
one,
there
were
no
compensatory
damages
in
fact
awarded
because
what
the
trial
court
said
was
that,
assuming
there's
a
high
enough
level
of
culpability...
that
is,
using
that
state
common
law
test
for
commercial
credit
reporting
agencies,
greenmoss
had
to
prove
culpability
far
higher
than
negligence
to
receive
any
verdict.
if
we
didn't
defeat
the
privilege,
we
would
not
receive
anything.
but
if
we
did
defeat
the
privilege...
and
we
did
that
in
this
case...
the
damages
under
any
presumption
were,
as
the
trial
court
said,
one
dollar.
the
trial
court
said
that
substantial
damages
were
not
permitted
unless
greenmoss
proved
they
in
fact
occurred;
and
in
the
very
next
sentence
said
compensation
had
to
be
specifically
related
to
damages
that
were
actually
caused
by
d&b.
further,
compensatory
damages
here
were
only
lost
profits
and
and
out
of
pocket
losses.
now,
the
court
allowed
the
jury
to
assess
pre-judgment
interest
at
vermont's
statutory
rates
on
a
per
annum
basis
from
the
date
of
injury
to
the
date
of
verdict.
dun
&
bradstreet
in
its
brief
says
that
the
most
actual
damages
we
showed
was
$36,000.
when
you
calculate
the
interest
on
$36,000
at
the
rates
the
trial
court
allowed
the
jury
to
do,
you
come
up
with
a
figure
of
$50,022.30.
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
the
compensatory
damage
award
did
in
this
case.
secondly,
dun
&
bradstreet
points
out
that
$36,000
is
only
one
year
of
lost
profits,
ignoring
the
evidence
at
transcript
99
and
104
that
an
additional
$42,000
of
lost
profits
was
incurred
in
the
next
year
thereafter.
curiously,
the
aspect
of--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--no,
i
don't.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
no,
we
wouldn't
have
to
prove
fault.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
but
i'd
like
to
focus,
your
honor,
on
the
state's
interest
in
presumed
damage,
and
i'd
like
to
move
a
little
bit
differently
than
this
court
did
in
gertz.
i
would
submit
that
presumed
damages,
especially
in
cases
like
this
where
you
have
defamation
of
a
corporation,
it
really
doesn't
involve
the
plaintiff
proving
the
quantum
of
damages
that
makes
presumed
damages
so
necessary
to
the
states
for
preservation
of
reputation.
quite
to
the
contrary,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
making
the
causal
link
between
demonstrated
injury
and
the
defendant's
acts
that
really
involves
the
states'
interests.
if
a
plaintiff
comes
into
court,
as
did
elmer
gertz,
and
says,
i've
been
defamed,
but
says
nothing
else
about
suffering
damages...
justice
stevens,
your
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
case
in
the
gertz
case
points
that
out;
there
was
no
evidence
of
actual
damage
in
gertz...
i
would
suggest
that
a
jury
will
not
hand
out
and
a
judge
will
not
condone
a
hefty
verdict
under
a
charge
like
the
charge
in
the
greenmoss
case.
it's
the
causality
link
in
the
presumption
that
has
the
important
state
function.
it's
the
tracing
and
linking
between
the
loss
and
the
wrongful
conduct
that
creates
the
problem
for
the
defamed
person.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
yes,
your
honor...
well,
they
were
dun
&
bradstreet's
instructions
almost
verbatim.
but
we
did
ask
the
court
to
charge
under
traditional
common
law
libel.
the
trial
court
used
virtually
all
of
dun
&
bradstreet's
requests.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
don't
think
they
have
a
similarity
with
the
newspapers,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
yes,
it
was,
in
the
vermont
supreme
court.
we
never
got
to
the
question
of
whether
gertz
should
apply
at
the
trial
court
level.
they
just
didn't
raise
it
until
after
the
verdict.
but
getting
back
to
where
the
legitimate
state
function
comes
in
here--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--yes.
the
court
adopted
their
request
verbatim...
no,
they
didn't
request
it
verbatim.
the
trial
court
i
believe
went
to
the
vermont
supreme
court
law
library
during
the
lunch
recess
and
got
that
charge.
it
wasn't
really
what
dun
&
bradstreet
had
asked
for.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
oh,
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
no,
we
didn't,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
we
didn't
do
that
is
because
we're
dealing
with
defamation
of
a
corporation,
and
i
felt
as
a
trial
strategy
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
suggest
to
a
jury
that
a
corporation
can
be
humiliated,
and
so
i
didn't
ask
for--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--you
certainly
can.
but
i
thought
with
a
vermont
jury
it
was
better
to
say
to
them
that
you
lose
your
profits
and
you
lose
your
out
of
pocket
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
sometimes
they're
cheap,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
the
presumption
that
allows
substantial
damages
without
even
an
offer
of
evidence
of
actual
injury,
which
is
what
you
had
in
gertz,
is
one
thing.
but
here
the
legitimate
state
function
of
presumed
damages
is
that
the
intuition
of
common
experience
as
it
has
found
its
way
in
the
common
law
through
centuries
of
defamation
precedent
counseled
that
it's
certain
that
the
harm
proved
is
causally
related
to
the
defamation
when
those
two
things
coexist
in
time.
and
i
think
that's
really
the
function
that
the
states
have
here.
bear
in
mind
what
dun
&
bradstreet
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
say
that
the
states'
interests
don't
matter,
and
the
effect
of
this
case
if
dun
&
bradstreet
is
right
will
be
without
question
to
totally
constitutionalize
the
state
law
of
defamation.
now,
i
think
there
is
another
role
or
another
state
interest
that
states
have
in
defamation,
and
that
is
the
interest,
as
the
vermont
supreme
court
pointed
out,
in
the
difference
between
an
individual
who
lives
in
a
world
that
is
increasingly
dominated
by
large
commercial
entities,
may
well
be
less
able
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
consequences
of
the
falsehood
than
the
business
that
sells
the
report.
i
think
that's
another
legitimate
state
interest
involved
here.
finally,
vermont,
different
than
gertz
and
in
fact
different
than
many
states,
has
a
specific
constitutional
provision
that
protects
the
reputation
of
its
citizenry.
our
constitution
specifically
says
that
the
character
of
our
citizens
has
special
protection.
so
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
here
is
to
say,
does
a
constitutional
interest
apply?
we
say
the
only
way
the
constitutional
interest
can
apply
is
if
there
is
a
real
valid
threat
of
self-censorship.
i
don't
think
there's
a
valid
threat
of
self-censorship.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
the
issue
again
is
self-censorship.
is
the
newspaper
going
to
say
that
they
won't
publish
this
fact...
and
we're
not
talking
about
your
analysis
of
greenmoss'
business.
we're
talking
about
this
fact,
greenmoss
is
bankrupt.
if
the
newspaper
is
going
to
say
they
won't
publish
the
fact
because
of
presumed
damages,
and
if
they
won't
publish
that
for
that
reason,
for
the
reason
of
presumed
and
punitive
damages,
then
the
news
will
just
be
pablum,
and
that's
the
fear
that
the
court
has,
obviously.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
yes.
i'm
getting
into
the
answer
that
i
think
is
involved
here.
the
issue
is
chilling
of
speech.
i
don't
think
a
company
like
dun
&
bradstreet
is
going
to
be
chilled,
because,
for
one
thing,
the
news
media
very
rarely
simply
publishes
a
fact.
they
publish
the
fact
in
connection
with
a
thesis.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
i'm
not
really
addressing
what
should
happen
in
the
situation
with
the
newspaper.
i
don't
think
you
can
take
the
result--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
think
under
gertz
if
there
was
negligence,
which
in
this
case
there
is
obviously
negligence,
the
plaintiff
would
be
entitled
to
the
gertz...
the
plaintiff
would
be
limited
by
the
gertz
rule.
but
i
really
think
we
have
a
different
type
of
defendant
here.
gertz
talks
about
broad
rules
of
application,
and
you
don't
have
to
look
at
every
particular
possible
exception.
but
i
would
say
one
other
thing,
hopefully
to
more
fully
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
and
that
is
in
this
case
if
the
exact
same
facts
occurred
we
may
have
the
same
result.
if
the
newspaper
did
exactly
what
dun
&
bradstreet
did,
by
sending
a
15
year
old
high
school
kid
with
no
training
up
to
the
federal
court
in
burlington
for
$200
a
year
and
never
told
her
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
up
there,
never
edited
the
information,
never
followed
its
own
rules
that
it
had
on
the
books
for
prepublication
verification--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--well,
i
think
i'm
just
saying
in
those
hypotheticals
what
dun
&
bradstreet
is
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
the
newspaper
would
not
have
the
same
result,
and
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
do
say
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
i
don't
know
what
a
jury
would
do,
your
honor.
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
the
type
of
instructions
that
we
had
in
this
case,
the
instructions
were
very
carefully
drafted
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
defamation
and
the
punitive
damage
award,
and
they
didn't
focus
on
the
speech.
they
focused
on
the
entire
gamut
of
conduct.
it
wasn't
really
looking
at
the
speaker
and
saying
that
speech
is
bad
and
we're
going
to
punish
it
by
way
of
punitive
damages.
it
really
looked
at
the
entire
course
of
conduct
under
traditional
common
law
rules.
one
thing
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
finally
is
that,
let's
suppose,
to
follow
up
on
your
point,
your
honor,
that
dun
&
bradstreet
got
the
same
protection
that
robert
welch,
incorporated,
got.
under
this
trial
what
would
happen
is
that
constitutional
protection
for
actual
damages
would
apply
because
of
gertz,
and
then
the
constitutional
damages
for
punitive
damages
under
new
york
times
would
apply.
but
in
addition
to
that,
not
only
would
the
plaintiff,
but
dun
&
bradstreet
would
look
for
the
common
law
punitive
damage
charge
just
to
get
to
the
question
of
any
compensatory
damage,
and
then
common
law
malice
to
think
about
and
focus
upon
the
other
activity
that
this
defendant
engaged
in.
so
you
would
have
four
separate
things
for
the
jury
to
handle.
i
think
that
would
just
hopelessly
confuse
a
jury.
there's
been
a
lot
of
commentary
about
the
difficulty
between
actual
malice
and
common
law
malice
and
constitutional
malice,
and
essentially
what
they're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
have
a
trial
where
there
are
those
four
instructions.
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
well,
i
understand
that
that
is
what
happened
with
mr.
gertz,
your
honor.
but
the
problem
in
mr.
gertz'
case
is
he
didn't
come
in
and
show
any--
mr.
thomas
f.
heilmann
--i
think
the
difficulty
that
this
case
presents
really
shows
why
gertz
was
formulated
just
to
handle
media
defendants.
this
defendant
has
never
claimed
until
this
afternoon
that
it's
a
media
defendant.
the
case
proceeded
to
the
vermont
supreme
court
and
the
certiorari
petition
was
granted
solely
based
on
non-media
status.
and
i
think
the
difficulties
here
with
gertz
show
that
the
decision
was
very
carefully
framed
in
both
rationale,
philosophy,
and
language
to
deal
with
a
specific
type
of
defendant.
my
final
point
is
this.
i
mentioned
earlier
that
if
this
case
is
extended,
if
gertz
is
extended
to
this
type
of
a
defendant,
what
we
will
have
is
the
total
constitutionalization
of
the
state
laws
of
libel.
and
i
think
we
really
have
to
ask
ourselves
whether
that's
appropriate
policy.
now,
we
have
made
accommodations
as
a
society
to
the
reputation
of
our
citizens
for
the
benefit
of
strong
first
amendment
protections.
but
if
gertz
applies
here,
i'd
suggest
to
the
court
it
will
mean
that
reputation
is
so
cheap
and
so
unvalued
in
our
society
that
it
can
be
destroyed
by
the
local
gossip
monger
or
by
a
huge
company
that
pays
an
untrained
high
schooler
$200
a
year
to
perform
a
task
she
was
never
trained
to
do.
if
private
reputation
can
be
so
easily
damaged,
then
we
have
to
ask
the
other
question:
what
benefit
is
there
to
a
good
reputation?
i
think
the
court
will
have
to
question
what
such
a
result
will
do
to
the
positive
normative
benefits
that
reputation
contributes
to
our
society,
and
at
the
same
time
consider
what
it
will
do
to
the
goal
that
the
framers
had
in
mind
for
the
first
amendment
if
over-the-fence
rumor
and
idle
gossip
at
the
water
cooler
receives
constitutional
protection.
every
constitutional...
every
libel
case
in
the
country
will
have
the
gertz
standard
if
dun
&
bradstreet
is
correct
in
this
case.
i
think
enough
speech
has
been
protected
under
the
new
york
times
formula
where
you
look
at
the
plaintiff
and
enough
speech
has
been
protected
when
you
look
at
media
defendants.
i
don't
think
there's
a
need
to
extend
gertz
any
further.
thank
you.
