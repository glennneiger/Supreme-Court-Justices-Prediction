mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today
is
whether
the
first
amendment's
limitations
on
presumed
and
punitive
damages
apply
to
non-media
defendants
in
actions
for
defamation.
petitioner
dun
&
bradstreet
has
urged
the
court
to
confirm
that
the
first
amendment
protects
all
speech
against
the
award
of
presumed
and
punitive
damages,
absent
actual
malice.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
fully
recognizing,
your
honor,
the
footnotes
in
several
opinions
dealing
with
private
defamation,
we
believe
that
this
court's
opinion
in
gertz
versus
robert
welch
leads
to
the
inescapable
conclusion
that
on
the
one
hand
the
states
have
no
substantial
interest
in
awarding
presumed
and
punitive
damages
against
any
speech
when
balanced
against
the
first
amendment
protections.
we
believe
that's
why
the
word
"confirm"
is
appropriate.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
in
this
court's
opinions
"private
defamation"
has
been
used
to
signify
the
status
of
the
plaintiff,
from
a
public
figure,
to
a
public
official,
to
a
private
figure.
but
defamation
by
definition
includes
a
publication
to
a
third
party.
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
that
there
really
is
no
such
thing
as
private
defamation.
when
i
speak
of
private
defamation
in
this
case,
i
am
really
referring
to
a
private
party,
not
a
public
figure
or
a
public
official.
we
believe
a
ruling
which
would--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--absolutely
not,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
is
a
freedom
which
is
enjoyed
by
all,
and
that
this
court
doesn't
make
distinctions
based
on
the
speaker
or
his
message
in
connection
with
defamation
cases.
we
believe
that
a
ruling
recognizing
that
neither
presumed
nor
punitive
damages
could
be
allowed,
absent
actual
malice,
would
do
two
very
important
things.
first,
it
would
recognize
the
very
legitimate
and
important
state
interest
in
protecting
the
reputational
interests
of
citizens
by
allowing
private
defamation
plaintiffs
to
recover
damages
for
actual
injury.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
my
point
was
that
if
you
recognize
the
rule
which
we
suggest
in
our
case
you
would
do
two
different
things:
one,
you
would
recognize
that
the
states
have
an
interest
in
protecting
the
reputations
of
their
citizens,
and
that
interest
is
satisfied
by
awarding
damages
for
actual
injury.
the
second
point
is
that
it
would
also
recognize
that,
absent
actual
malice,
the
states
have
no
interest
in
awarding
either
presumed
or
punitive
damages,
and
that
when
balanced
against
the
first
amendment
freedoms
it
precludes
such
an
award.
let
me
emphasize
that
dun
&
bradstreet
seeks
only
the
same
result
that
would
be
required
in
actions
brought
against
newspapers,
television,
syndicated
columnists.
whatever
the
term
"media"
means,
we
believe
that
all
citizens
are
entitled
to
that
freedom
under
the
first
amendment.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
we
believe
that
that
ruling
would
flow
naturally
from
the
court's
holding
in
gertz
versus
robert
welch,
which
significantly
recognized
that
the
states
have
no
interest
in
securing
for
defamation
plaintiffs
gratuitous
awards
of
money
damages
far
in
excess
of
any
actual
injury.
we
believe
the
highlights
of
the
case
before
the
court
recognize
the
very
concerns
which
troubled
this
court
in
gertz:
jury
awards
of
presumed
and
punitive
damages
in
wholly
unpredictable
amounts,
bearing
no
relationship
to
the
actual
harm
caused.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
some
of
my
colleagues
at
the
libel
bar
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
that
they
are
going
up.
there
is
one
fundamental
difference.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
where
there
was
libel
per
se
charged,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
damages
are
presumed.
other
torts
do
not
allow
a
court
to
give
presumed
damages.
i
should
not
say
"allow".
states
do
not
give
damages
for
presumed
injury.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
in
an
ordinary
negligence
case,
for
example,
one
of
the
key
elements
is
injury,
and
that
is
why.
plus...
and
i
tend
to
forget
this,
too...
we
are
balancing
defamation
laws
against
a
corresponding
first
amendment
right,
and
in
ordinary
negligence
cases
there
is
not
even
that
corresponding
first
amendment
right
except
as
due
process
would
require.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
chilling
effect
it
would
have
on
dun
&
bradstreet.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
dun
&
bradstreet
is
going
to
go
out
of
business.
in
fact,
it's
been
in
business
for
a
number
of
years.
but
i
think
we
must
look,
your
honor,
at
two
interests,
one
in
the
interest
of
the
free
flow
of
information
generally,
and
secondly
the
interest
in
the
recipients
of
dun
&
bradstreet
reports
to
get
prompt,
accurate
information.
and
let
me
be
specific.
if
dun
&
bradstreet
or
any
other
non-media
speaker,
whatever
that
means,
is
subject
to
unlimited
awards
for
presumed
and
punitive
damages,
i
think
two
things
will
happen.
one,
rather
than
publish
something
that
cannot
be
triple
checked
and
guaranteed,
that
information
simply
will
not
be
published.
for
example,
dun
&
bradstreet
will
oftentimes
include
in
its
reports
information
about
how
a
creditor
thinks
a
particular
corporation
or
proprietorship
pays
its
bills.
now,
when
that
person
that
is
the
subject
of
the
report
calls
dun
&
bradstreet
and
says,
i
don't
agree
with
you,
i
was
not
slow
90
days,
and
then
dun
&
bradstreet
calls
the
creditor
to
check
that
information
and
they
say,
well,
we
believe
that's
correct,
but
it's
in
our
files,
we
can't
be
sure,
if
dun
&
bradstreet
is
subject
to
unlimited
awards,
they
simply
won't
publish
that.
and
it's
important
in
the
free
flow
of
commercial
information
that
the
recipients
of
those
reports
know
that.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
know
the
fact
that
someone
is
slow
pay,
know
the
fact--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--what
i'm
saying
is,
your
honor,
he
may
have
sent
magnetic
tapes
to
dun
&
bradstreet
which
are
no
longer
in
existence.
it
may
take
three
or
four
weeks
to
corroborate.
and
it's
important
to
get
that
information
out.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
it
is
very
important
that
we
recognize
the
reputational
interest
of
our
citizens.
and
i
think
the
court
struck
the
appropriate
balance
when
in
the
gertz
case
it
says
private
defamation
plaintiffs
may
be
compensated
for
their
actual
injury.
in
this
case,
plaintiffs
defamed
are
entitled
to
compensation
for
actual
injury.
our
problem
with
this
case
is
that
the
jury
was
told
that
damages
were
presumed,
period.
they
need
not
prove
actual
damages.
and
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
it's
important--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--that
was
based,
your
honor,
on
the
vermont
qualified
privilege,
not
on
a
constitutional
standard.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
well,
the
instruction
was
faulty
because
it
did
not
define
actual
malice
in
the
sense
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
it
was
faulty
there.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
justice?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
correctly
recognize
that
that
is
constitutional
malice
in
the
sense
of
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth
or
knowledge
of
falsity.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--oh,
yes.
we
believe
the
record
reflects
this:
that
promptly
after
the
issuance
of
the
special
notice
which
caused...
which
set
forth
that
greenmoss
builders
had
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy,
that
when
the
president
of
greenmoss
called
dun
&
bradstreet,
on
that
very
day
they
issued
a
correction
in
the
form
of
a...
excuse
me,
a
retraction,
in
the
form
of
a
correction
notice.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
at
that
time,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
dun
&
bradstreet
did.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct,
although
they
did
send
that
information
to
the
five
recipients
that
did
get
the
original
special
notice.
that
is
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so
under
this
court's
constitutional
standard
dealing
with
focusing
on
the
speaker's
mind
at
the
time
of
the
publication.
this
would
go
to
something
after
the
publication
was
done.
as
i
was
indicating--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
require
a
different
analysis
than
we
have
in
the
defamation
area.
as
i
understand
the
question,
we
would
be
talking
about
individuals
publishing
matters
who
are
subject
to
the
control
of
the
sec,
as
being
licensed,
perhaps.
i
think
that
in
restraining
those
types
of
publications
there
is
a
much
different
focus.
in
those
cases,
i
believe
the
court
is
focusing
on
the
recipient
of
the
report
rather
than
the
individual
identified
in
the
report
in
defamation
cases.
and
i
think--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
what
we
are
talking
here
about
is
the
sole
issue
of
speech
in
context
of
defamation,
not
speech
in
the
context
of
giving
advisor's
advice
to
the
sec.
and
as
i
indicated,
i
believe
a
totally
different
analysis
would
apply
there.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
recognize
is
that
the
first
amendment
protects
all
speakers
against
these
types
of
awards,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
state
interest
varies
in
securing
gratuitous
awards
of
money
damages
for
plaintiffs
depending
on
the
speaker
or
the
message.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
i
must
admit
that
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
deciding
what
is
"media"
and
what
is
non-media.
as
we
indicate
in
our
reply
brief,
many
of
the
functions
that
dun
&
bradstreet
does
are
very
analogous
to
what
a
newspaper
does.
we
send
reporters
out
to
get
information.
the
information
is
edited
and
sent
to
clients
or
prepaid
subscribers
of
dun
&
bradstreet.
the
information
relates
to
matters
about
commerce.
not
much
different,
we
suggest,
than
what's
in
the
wall
street
journal
every
day
or
the
business
page
of
any
newspaper.
moreover,
as
i
was
reviewing
the
transcript
of
the
case
last
night,
i
came
across
something
which
struck
me,
which
i
think
directly
goes
to
your
question.
one
of
the
recipients
of
the
dun
&
bradstreet
report
was
the
manager
of
a
local
bank.
he
testified
that
the
bankruptcy
notice,
which
was
quickly
corrected,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
greenmoss.
but
he
also
said:
you
know,
i
look
at
newspapers
because
i'm
concerned
about
bankruptcies,
and
i
use
newspapers
to
inform
me
about
that
just
as
well
as
i
do
dun
&
bradstreet.
and
i
think
that
points
out
that
many
of
the
same
functions
done
by
dun
&
bradstreet
are
done
by
newspapers
and
vice
versa.
and
i
believe
the
second
aspect
of
your
question
dealt
with
the
commercial
speech
doctrine.
your
honor,
whatever
commercial
speech
is,
it
is
not
speech
about
commerce.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
seriously
contend
that
the
statement
greenmoss
is
bankrupt,
if
it
appeared
on
page
17
of
the
vermont
daily
free
press,
was
commercial
speech.
we
were
not
advertising
anything.
we
were
not
promoting
any
of
our
products.
this
simply
is
not
commercial
speech.
and
we
suggest
blur
is
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
get
around
what
we
believe
to
be
the
central
issue
in
the
case,
balancing
the
first
amendment
rights
of
all
speakers
on
the
one
hand
against
the
states'
limited
interest
in
securing
only
awards
of
actual
damages
for
private
plaintiffs.
we
believe
that
the
facts
of
this
case
highlight
the
very
concern
the
court
recognized
in
gertz.
in
july
1976
dun
&
bradstreet
sent
the
special
notice
to
five
subscribers
of
dun
&
bradstreet.
none
of
these
subscribers
was
a
customer
of
greenmoss,
a
local
building
concern.
it
did
state
that
greenmoss
had
filed
a
petition
in
bankruptcy.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
a
retraction
in
the
form
of
a
correction
notice
was
issued
promptly.
the
complaint
in
this
case
sought
damages
of
$7500
and
$15,000
in
punitive
damages.
yet,
after
a
two-day
trial
the
jury
awarded
$50,000
in
compensatory
damages
and
$300,000
in
punitive
damages.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
showed
that
plaintiff
had
not
called
any
recipient
of
the
report
to
prove
that
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
issuance
of
the
report,
its
receipt,
and
any
damage
by
greenmoss.
and
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
at
this
trial
by
anyone
establishing
a
causal
connection
between
the
publication
of
the
special
notice
and
the
company's
alleged
injury
and
damage.
what
we
believe
this
exorbitant
verdict
resulted
from
were
jury
instructions
which
gave
the
jury
uncontrolled
discretion
to
assess
unlimited
amounts
of
damages
without
regard
to
actual
injury
and
without
regard
to
dun
&
bradstreet's
state
of
mind.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
was
a
case
of
libel
per
se,
damage
and
loss
were
conclusively
presumed
from
publication.
the
jury,
as
i
indicated
previously,
was
not
given
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
actual
malice
charge
and
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$300,000
were
awarded.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
my
recollection
on
the
state
law
privilege
was
that
they
were
given
several
alternatives.
i
believe
we
set
that
forth
on
pages
18
and
19
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
must
show
malice
or
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
if
the
defendant
acted
in
bad
faith
toward
the
plaintiff
in
publishing
the
report,
or
that
the
defendant
intended
to
injure
the
plaintiff
in
its
business,
or
that
it
acted
in
a
willful,
wanton
or
reckless
disregard
to
the
interests
of
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
has
acted
maliciously
and
the
privilege
is
destroyed.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
let
me
be
clear,
justice
white.
they
defined
"malice"
in
the
state
law
privilege,
and
then
they
also
said,
but
you
may
award
punitive
damages
if
you
find
actual
malice,
and
the
court
never
defined
"actual
malice".
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
a
special
request.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
sir.
my
recollection
of
what
happened
at
the
trial
court
was
that
defendant's
counsel
moved
on
directed
verdict
to
dismiss
all
punitive
damages
because
it
had
not
met
the
actual
actual
malice
standard
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
no,
justice
brennan.
all
we
asked
for
was...
our
position
in
the
case
is
that
it
is
a
private
figure
case
and
we
should
have
the
same
protection
as
the
john
birch
society
had
in
the
gertz
case,
that
you
cannot
award
presumed
or
punitive
damages
absent
the
showing
in
new
york
times.
but
the
plaintiff
consistent--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--we
thought,
your
honor,
that
if
the
jury
was
going
to
be
charged
on
giving
punitive
damages
that
they
must
be
given
the
actual
malice
standard.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
to
be
awarded
presumed
damages.
but
that
the
plaintiff,
on
the
fault
standard
adopted
by
the
courts
in
vermont,
should
be
entitled
to
receive--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--are
you
talking
about
damages,
your
honor,
or
fault?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
we
would
be
satisfied
with
traditional
state
law
damage
charges
proper
in
a
libel
case,
but
which
did
not
allow
the
jury
to
award
presumed
damages.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
absent
a
showing
of
actual
malice.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes.
we
are
arguing,
your
honor,
that
the
gertz
standard
for
private
plaintiffs
should
have
been
applied
in
this
case
to
dun
&
bradstreet,
and
the
jury
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
award
presumed
damages.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
concede
fault
under
whatever
vermont
standard
there
is.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
as
i
emphasize
again--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--in
that
case.
i
will
agree
with
that,
because
throughout
that
opinion
we
hear
the
phrase
publishers,
media.
it
may
be
that
the
word
"speakers"
was
even
used.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
we
are
absolutely
a
publisher.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
we
are
a
medium
of
communication,
and
like
an
individual
in
the
street
is
a
medium
of
communication
and
like
the
new
york
times
is
a
medium
of
communication.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
let
me
rephrase
that,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
oh,
no,
i'm
not.
i
just
want
to
turn
it
to
i
think
give
the
proper
answer
to
you.
i
think
our
position
is
not
what
request
that
we
would
have
requested,
but
objections
to
requests
permitting
presumed
damages.
we
objected
to
a
presumed
damage
charge.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
don't
think
this
was
a
case
of
wanting
a
presumed
damage
charge,
but
not
wanting
a
presumed
damage
charge.
our
point
is
we
don't
think
presumed
damages
should
have
been
charged
unless
we
met
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
actual
malice
test.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
in
the
lower...
on
the
subject
of
new
york
times?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
at
the
trial
court
level,
my
recollection
is
that
the
only
charge
requested
by
dun
&
bradstreet
going
to
damages
was
that,
if
you're
going
to
charge
libel
per
se,
please
charge
it
this
way.
there
was
no
charge,
your
honor--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--the
concern
was
that
the
trial
court--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--it
is
set
forth,
i
believe,
in
the
cert
petition.
it
is
petitioner's
requested
charge
number
three.
and
i
believe
we
were
in
a
hobson's
choice.
we
knew
that
the
court
was
going
to
charge
libel
per
se.
our
concern
was,
if
you're
going
to
charge
it,
which
we
did
not
agree
with,
that
at
least
charge
it
this
way.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
only
charge
that
was
given
at
the
lower
court
level
concerning
damages,
although
prior
to
that
the
judge
had
been
handed
a
copy
of
the
gertz
decision
in
connection
with
plaintiff's
request
that
he
be
allowed
to
introduce
dun
&
bradstreet's
financial
statements.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes,
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
two
grounds.
first
and
foremost,
that
the
jury
charge
permitted
an
award
of
presumed
damage,
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
to
prove
actual
injury.
that
we
believe
alone
is
sufficient
to
order
a
new
trial.
in
fact,
we
believe
that's
what
happened
in
the
gertz
case.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
if
the
jury
was
allowed
to
presume
damage
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
what
in
fact--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--could
they
give
him
damages?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes,
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
that
is
because
of
the
way
it
was
described
in
the
jury
verdict,
your
honor.
we
used
that
phrase
because
that's
the
exact
phrase
that
the
jury
foreman
signed
dealing
with
compensatory
and
punitive.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
if
that
action
was
the
result
of
a
totally
independent
tort
and
that
action
would
sustain
an
award
of
presumed
damages
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
first
amendment,
i
would
agree
with
justice
stevens.
but
this
case
was
a
case
based
on
the
first
amendment,
based
on
defamation,
and
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
which
would
permit
the
state
of
vermont,
consistent
with
the
first
amendment--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
first
amendment
would
protect
that...
would
allow
that.
what
we
do
say--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--because
the
first
amendment
in
the
defamation
area
we
believe
focuses
on
the
defendant's
state
of
mind
when
the
publication
was
made.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
your
honor,
my
reading
of
the
first
amendment
cases
simply
would
not
permit
that
kind
of--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--i
understand
that.
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
much
different
than
other
cases
where
in
fact
you
don't
know
who's
received
it.
i
mean,
if
the
new
york
times
were
sued,
would
it
be
a
good
defense
at
state
law
to
suggest
that
we
don't
know
the
500,000
people
that
got
the
daily
copy
of
the
new
york
times?
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
client
has
changed
his
policy
in
that
regard,
that
in
fact
it
is
now
given
out.
let
me
suggest
one--
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
would
suggest
not
in
this
case.
one
quick
point
on
what
happened
in
connection
with
the
request.
i
believe
the
record
reflects
that
one
request
was
made
for
disclosure
at
the
time
of
the
initial
contact
between
plaintiff
and
defendant's
office.
we
said
we
didn't
have
it
at
that
time
and
no
further
request
was
made.
mr.
gordon
lee
garrett,
jr.
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
teachings
in
st.
amant
versus
thompson.
you
look
at
the
subjective
actual
malice
of
the
speaker
at
the
time.
thank
you
very
much.
