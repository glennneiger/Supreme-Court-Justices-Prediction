mr.
george
e.
schumacher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
have
been
clearly
defined,
particularly
that
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
pretrial
publicity
infringed
on
the
ability
of
my
client,
mr.
yount,
to
select
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
clearfield
county,
pennsylvania,
during
his
second
trial
in
1970.
however,
at
least
some
reference
to
the
sensational
nature
of
the
first
murder...
of
the
murder
in
this
case
that
was
tried
originally
in
1966
is
appropriate
because
it
was
a
sensational
murder
by
a
high
school
teacher
of
his
student
that
was
closely
covered
by
the
news
media.
each
detail
of
his
voluntary
surrender,
of
his
confessions
to
the
police,
of
the
pretrial
procedures,
of
the
trial
in
which
he
maintained
an
insanity
defense,
were
closely
followed
by
the
news
media.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
four
years
later
these
jurors
now
that
are
called
before
the
same
judge,
the
same
courtroom,
following
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
for
miranda
violations,
and
who
testify
that
a
very
high
percentage
of
them,
something
like
98
percent,
recall
the
facts
of
this
case,
have
read
about
it,
are
familiar
with
it--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
no,
there's
no
way
of
knowing
because
that
was
never
in
the
voir
dire.
all
i
can
set
forth
in
the
appendix
are
the
newspaper
articles
that
were
available
and
they
could
have
become
familiar
with.
what
can
be
gathered
from
the
facts
of
the
voir
dire,
however,
are
the
many
statements
made
by
people
questioned
that
he
admitted
he
did
it
before,
he
confessed
before,
statements
i
think
that
are
very
accurately
revealed
in
the
testimony
of
vera
krapf,
one
of
the
jurors
who
was
a
minister's
wife
and
who
when
questioned
indicated
that
the
people
from
the
congregation
came
to
her
and
stated
to
her
that
it
was
time,
that
she
had
been
selected
to
appear
before
this
court,
possibly
to
be
selected
as
a
juror,
for
her
to
come
forth
and
be
counted,
and
she
testified
that
these
people
that
came
to
her
felt
that
he
had
received
a
fair
trial
and
is
lucky
he
didn't
get
the
death
penalty.
and
this
was
the
atmosphere
in
the
community
from
which
this
jury
was
selected
and
from
which
some
72
percent
of
the
jurors
admitted
that
they
had
an
opinion
of
guilt
and
were
successfully
challenged
for
cause,
and
a
higher
number
of
jurors
admitted
opinions,
the
question
becoming
primarily,
as
previously
indicated,
whether
particularly
one
of
them,
juror
hrin,
was
so
prejudiced
and
partial
that
he
should
not
have
been
permitted
to
sit
as
a
juror
on
this
case.
so
his
testimony
has
already
been
mentioned
in
the
first
argument,
indicating
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
a
fixed
opinion
and
that
he
would
require
testimony
to
be
presented
before
he
could
change
that
opinion.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
this,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
which,
under
irvin,
indicates
the
nature
and
strength
of
a
venireman's
opinion,
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
the
difficulty,
your
honor,
in
establishing
that
as
clearly
indicating
an
issue
of
credibility
is
how
that
issue
of
credibility
was
resolved
adversely
to
mr.
yount
by
the
trial
judge
whereas
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
examining
exactly
the
same
record,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
indicated
that
he
was
not
an
impartial
juror.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
well,
your
honor,
that
is
a
very
difficult
question
to
require
me,
representing
mr.
yount
to
answer.
obviously
the
trial
judge
can
see
the
person,
can
hear
the
testimony,
and
can
reflect
on
the
way
it's
given.
however,
it's
the
words
here
that
are
spoken
that
are
so
important,
not
necessarily
how
they're
spoken,
and
the
words
nevertheless
are
in
the
record
that
he
would
require
evidence
to
put
aside
his
opinion,
and
that
it
is
a
fixed
opinion
even
though
at
some
future
time
he
says
it
isn't
as
fixed
as
it
was
before.
when
the
trial
judge
resolved
that
issue,
he
said,
he
stated
it
was
fixed,
next
he
stated
it
isn't
as
fixed
as
it
previously
was;
therefore,
it
isn't
a
fixed
opinion,
which
i
consider
to
be
totally
illogical,
and
i
would
not
accept
that
resolution
of
that
issue
whether
or
not
the
man
were
before
me
or
not.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
and
was
so.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
right,
with
similar
type...
not
i,
but
my
client
did
so,
72
percent
of
the
jurors
on
this
case,
and
as
irvin
teaches,
or
at
least
there's
some
doubt
raised
when
a
situation
exists
in
a
community
of
this
nature
when
80
percent
of
the
individuals
that
participate
in
the
voir
dire
have
opinions,
as
to
their
veracity
in
answering
this
questions
of
this
nature.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
well,
as
i
read
section
2254(d)(8),
the
determination
must
be
made
by
the
federal
habeas
corpus
case...
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
determination
is
fairly
supported
by
the
record.
now,
the
circuit
court,
when
considering
that
issue
here,
held
that
the
ruling
of
the
trial
judge
was
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
when
he
answered
that
he
had
an
opinion,
that
he
had
a
fixed
opinion,
and
he
indicated
that
he
would
definitely
require
evidence
before
he
could
change
that
opinion
and
wouldn't
change
his
mind
until
facts
were
presented,
those
are
sufficient
answers
to
alert
this
court
that
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
its
determination
that
he
could
not
sit
as
an
impartial
juror.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
there
were--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--yes.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
the
habeas
corpus
petition
is
in
the
record,
and
i
cannot
give
you
a
page
reference.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
but
as
i
recall,
that
was
an
issue
early
in
the
case,
and
the
district
court
neither
addressed
specific
matters
pertaining
to
the...
it
did
not
address
specific
matters
pertaining
to
the
publicity,
but
it
did
specifically
address
the
testimony
of
juror
hrin
in
judge
ziegler's
opinion.
the
problem
with
judge
ziegler's
opinion
was
that
he
stopped
at
the
crucial
points
where
the
questions
that
i'm
indicating
would
indicate
juror
bias
and
stressed
some
of
the
points
that
your
honor
previously
mentioned.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that's
only
fair.
and
i
would
also
submit
that
the
commonwealth
arguing
that
the...
we
were
attempting
to
mix
apples
and
oranges
is
as
similar
as
their
attempting
to
mix
longberger
and
fusham
with
irvin
and
murphy
because
there
are
totally
different
concepts
involved
there
with
post-trial
hearings
in
which
credibility
was
adjudicated
in
a
completely
separate
and
distinct
fashion
than
was
accomplished
in
this
case,
and
unless
this
court
now
is
facing
the
prospect
of
reversing
irvin
v.
dowd,
we
would
still
rely
on
the
position
that
the
nature
and
strength
of
the
venireman's
opinion
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
as
such,
each
of
the
habeas
corpus
courts
must
independently
review
the
record
before
them,
and
there
is
far
more
support
for
the
analysis
of
the
record
by
the
circuit
court
in
its
footnotes
to
its
opinion
than
was
done
by
the
state
county
court
or
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes.
the
pennsylvania
supreme...
was
this
challenge--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--i
don't
know.
i
didn't
represent
him
then,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
from
which--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--but
the
general
issue
of
jury
impartiality
was
raised
as
to
all
the
jurors.
the
entire
transcript
was
presented
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
affirmed
saying
these
findings
are
fairly
supported
by
the
record,
in
other
words,
when
the
district
trial
court
held
that
it
was
not
unfair
and
that
there
was...
and
that
there
was
no
public
interest
in
the
case
and
practically
no
persons
present
in
the
court,
and
that
the
jurors
decided
that
the
case
on
the
law
and
the
evidence.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
well,
i
don't
want
to
beg
your
question;
i
want
to
answer
it
as
directly
as
possible.
i
didn't
represent
him
then.
i
wasn't
there.
i
don't
know
for
sure.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
from
which
i
can
say
it
was
and
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
i
will.
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
specific
in
its
treatment
of
2254
and
its
analysis
indicating
that
this
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
that
it
had
independently
analyzed
the
voir
dire
testimony
as
well
as
the
pretrial
publicity,
and
of
course,
we
have
never
maintained
that
the
publicity
was
of
such
a
nature
as
to
utterly
corrupt
the
trial
as
in
the
sheppard
case,
and
have
consistently
maintained
the
burden
of
requiring...
of
prejudice
in
this
case
in
order
to
come
forward
and
satisfy
the
test
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
trial.
but
the
third
circuit
in
its
opinion
very
clearly
pointed
out
that
it
felt
this
was
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
and
that
the
determinations
of
the
state
courts
and
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
were
clearly
erroneous.
it
did
so
in
several
regards,
in
regard
to
the
publicity,
in
regard
to
the
interest
in
the
community,
and
another
factor
involved
is
that
apparently
the
trial
court
took
into
consideration
not
merely
the
publicity
which
it
said
had
died
down
over
a
four
year
period
of
time,
but
ignored
the
fact
that
the
voir
dire
itself
reflected
the
interest
of
the
community
and
the
knowledge
of
the
community
on
what
had
taken
place
before.
mr.
yount
was
retried
in
the
same
community,
in
the
same
courtroom
where
he
had
been
tried
in
1966.
he
was
again
retried
in
1970.
a
completely
different
case
was
presented,
both
by
the
prosecution
and
by
the
defense.
there
was
no
rape
charged
in
the
second
trial.
it
was
a
murder
case.
much
of
the
confession,
the
oral
statements,
had
been
suppressed.
the
weapon
that
was
alleged
to
be
the
murder
weapon
was
suppressed.
the
bloody
clothing
was
suppressed.
and
yet
all
of
these
items
were
in
the
publicity
that
this
jury
had
previously
been
exposed
to.
mr.
yount
testified
in
the
first
trial;
he
did
not
in
the
second.
a
defense
of
temporary
insanity
was
presented
in
the
first
trial.
in
the
second
trial
character
evidence
was
presented
on
his
background,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
college
graduate,
a
husband,
a
father,
had
no
prior
criminal
record,
was
a
school
teacher
in
the
community,
in
order
to
show
that
the
requisite
intent
for
first
degree
murder
was
not
present,
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
degree
of
guilt.
and
in
this
situation,
jurors
that
were
exposed
to
the
publicity
of
the
first
trial,
jurors
who
had
read
and
heard,
jurors
who
had
fixed
opinions
of
guilt,
first
of
all
established
through
the
voir
dire
and
secondly...
i
must
apologize
to
the
court.
that
is
the
correct
pronunciation
in
pennsylvania,
and
i
have
difficulty
after
27
years
of
getting
away
from
it.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--of
obtaining
a
fair
trial
by
impartial
jurors,
and
obviously
the
most
direct
example
of
that,
we
submit,
is
juror
hrin's
testimony,
and
would
stand
on
it,
taking
it
as
a
whole,
indicating
that
he
testified
that
he
had
a
fixed
opinion
that
could
not
be
set
aside
unless
evidence
was
presented
that
would
convince
him
to
change
his
mind.
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
of
judge
garth
is
most...
clearly
analyzes
this
specific
aspect
of
the
case.
the
name
of
mr.
hrin,
your
honor,
is
not
specifically
referred
to
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
he
at
page
302a
of
the
transcript
refers
in
percentage
figures
to
the
number
of
jurors
who
held
opinions,
but
his
name
is
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
of
the
twelve
seated
jurors,
nine
stated
they
had
read
about
the
case.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
may
i
have
a
moment,
please?
when
it
says
two
stated
that
they
would
require
petitioner
to
prove
his
innocence,
i--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--excuse
me.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
we
filed
briefs
and
had
two
hearings
on
the
habeas--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--oh,
i
did,
yes,
sir.
and
judge--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--yes,
and
judge
ziegler
then,
in
response
to
our
briefs,
specifically
referred--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--i
did
not
represent
mr.
yount
before
the
state
courts.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
there
were
briefs
filed.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
my
best
recollection
is
that
they
did.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
when
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him
some
three
years
ago,
these
briefs
were
made
available
to
me
and
i
read
them,
and
i
am
going
by
my
memory
of
reading
them.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
i...
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
if
they
are.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
no.
the
only
reference,
your
honor,
to
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
was
that
i
amended
the
habeas
corpus
petition
to
include
an
incompetency
of
counsel
claim,
and
then
rose
v.
lurdy,
and
obviously
i
very
hastily
deleted.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
he's
in
camp
hill,
pennsylvania.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
yes,
sir,
and
that's
the
reason
my
answer
would
be--
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
--he's
been
in
jail
for
17
years
without
a
fair
trial
is
my
position.
mr.
george
e.
schumacher
well,
i
think
so,
and
the
commonwealth
has
indicates
its
willingness
and
ability
to
retry
him
and
has
never
indicated
there
was
any
prejudice
from
the
passage
of
time.
it
was
seven
years
between
the
denial
of
the...
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
appeal
and
the
application
for
write
of
habeas
corpus.
the
position,
i
believe,
has
been
clearly
briefed
and
set
forth,
your
honors,
unless
there
are
any
additional
questions.
