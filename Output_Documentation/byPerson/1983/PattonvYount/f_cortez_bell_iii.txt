mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
instant
matter
before
the
court
this
afternoon,
paton
v.
yount,
presents
this
court
a
broad,
general
question
dealing
with
the
impact
of
pretrial
publicity
upon
the
ability
to
select
and
empanel
a
fair
and
impartial
jury,
as
well
as
a
question
dealing
with
what
if
any
standard
is
to
be
provided
to
the
federal
courts
for
purposes
of
reviewing
a
state
court
conviction.
however,
contained
within
that
broad
and
general
question
is
a
much
narrower,
much
smaller
question.
however,
that
question
is
very
important,
and
that
being
what
standard
is
to
be
applied
by
a
federal
court
to
a
state
court
determination
of
the
impartiality
of
not
only
just
one
juror
but
of
a
jury
panel
as
a
whole.
now,
the
basic
factual
history
setting
forth
these
particular
issues
have
previously
been
exhaustively
covered
both
in
the
record
and
in
the
brief
of
counsel.
with
regard
to
the
2254
analysis,
the
respondents
in
their
brief
rather
summarily
dismiss
this
particular
issue.
however,
it
is
the
petitioners'
assertion
that
this
issue
is
very
important
not
only
to
this
particular
case
but
also
to
the
federal
circuits
and
the
federal
district
courts.
the
courts
since
the
inception
of
federal
habeas
corpus
review
have
constantly
struggled
with
the
question
as
to
how
much
deference
should
be
given
to
a
state
court
determination,
and
of
course,
as
part
of
that
struggle,
that
has
led
to
a
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
court
systems.
with
the
amendment
in
1966
of
section
2254
by
adding
a
provision
2254(d),
congress
initially
made
an
attempt
to
attempt
to
alleviate
some
of
this
particular
conflict.
however,
it
seems
that
due
to
the
recent
influx
of
cases
that
have
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
2254,
that
particular
provision
has
led
to
more
litigation
rather
than
ceasing
the
litigation
in
the
various
federal
courts.
it
wasn't
until
this
court's
decision
in
sumner
v.
mata
in
1981
that
this
court
orally
addressed
in
that
particular
opinion
what
standard
of
review,
what
should
the
federal
courts
do
with
regard
to
state
court
determinations.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
state
court
determinations
basically
as
to
factual
matters.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes,
not
the
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law.
with
regard
to
that
particular
decision,
it
set
forth
that
the
federal
courts
must
not
only
note
the
provisions
of
2254,
but
that
they
must
go
one
step
further
and
indicate
the
basis
of
their
analysis
so
the
reviewing
court
could
review
their
determination,
on
what
basis
did
they
decide
that
the
state
court
determination
as
to
a
factual
matter
would
not
be
accorded
the
presumption
of
correctness?
now,
in
essence,
what
we
have
in
the
present
case
before
the
court
today,
we
have
a
state
trial
court
and
pennsylvania
state
supreme
court
determination
as
to
the
issue
of
juror
impartiality.
so
the
first
question
that
must
be
addressed
is
is
this
a
factual
determination,
or
is
this
a
determination
of
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes,
this
was
at
the
second
state
trial
in
1970.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
fourteen
years
ago,
yes.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes.
the
actual
occurrence
in
this
particular
case
was
april
28
of
1966.
the
first
trial
was
held
with
a
decision
being
reached
by
the
jury
october
7
of
1966,
and
then
the
second
trial
occurred
in
november
20th
of
'70,
1970.
with
regard
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
this
is
a
factual
determination,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
what
we
have
in
essence
here
is
a
determination
of
a
credibility
issue
by
the
trial
court
judge,
in
this
particular
case,
judge
charry,
and
hearing
the
indications
from
the
person
on
the
voir
dire,
that
person
indicating
as
to
whether
they
had
an
opinion,
did
not
have
an
opinion,
whether
it
was
fixed
or
unfixed,
or
even
where
they
could
set
that
opinion
aside,
what
the
trial
court
judge
was
doing
in
that
case
was
determining
the
credibility
of
that
particular
person,
was
what
they
were
saying
is
believable
based
upon
their
demeanor,
their
tone,
the
inflection
in
their
voice.
now,
this
particular
issue
as
to
credibility
is
a
very
difficult
issue
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
appellate
review.
as
this
court
has
indicated
that
based
upon
a
record
before
the
appellate
courts
and
any
appellate
court
this
applies
to,
even
within
the
states,
it
is
very
difficult
to
have
a
flavor
of
what
went
on
actually
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
during
the
course
of
the
voir
dire
examination.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
determination
by
the
trial
judge
as
to
these
individual
jurors
and
as
to
the
panel
as
a
whole,
the
12
individuals
that
were
selected,
that
they
were
impartial.
now,
based
upon
this
court's
decision,
in
marshall
v.
longberger,
which
indicated
that
a
credibility
determination
of
a
witness
is
such
that
it
should,
or
great
deference
should
be
given
to
the
trial
judge,
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
judge
in
clearfield
county.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
an
issue
as
to
fact,
not
a
mixed
question
as
to
the
law
in
fact.
the
law
in
this
particular
case,
irvin
v.
dowd,
which
the
federal
court
of
appeal
in
the
third
circuit
applied
to
this
particular
case,
i
submit
to
the
court
was
misapplied.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
essence
was
determine
the
statistical
analysis
based
on
the
individuals
as
a
whole
who
were
not
selected
for
the
panel
for
various
reasons,
and
used
that
in
order
to
overturn
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
individuals
on
their
voir
dire
indicating
that
either
yes
or
no,
they
had
opinions,
and
yes
or
no,
that
they
would
set
them
aside.
in
essence,
we
also
have
a
decision
not
only
as
to
this
credibility,
but
also
as
indicated
before
this
particular
court,
in
various
other
cases
of
the
court.
prior
to
the
beginnings
of
2254(d),
which
was
in
1966...
and
i
just
note
in
passing
that
irvin
v.
dowd
predated
that
in
1961...
the
various
decisions
of
this
court
mention
this
issue
as
to
juror
impartiality
and
the
struggle
that
was
working
with
regard
to
it.
clear
back
in
1878
in
reynolds
v.
united
states,
they
talk
about
publicity
at
that
early
date,
and
they
indicated
the
struggle
that
once
again
occurred
with
challenges
for
cause
as
to
publicity,
as
to
prejudice,
as
to
the
jurors
to
be
selected,
and
also
in
the
holt
v.
united
states
in
1910.
at
that
particular
time
with
regard
to
those
cases,
the
court
did
not
deal
with
a
2254
analysis
but
simply
indicated
that
a
state
court
determination
with
regard
to
those
particular
issues,
which
it
did
indicate
at
that
time
was
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
court
by
granting
great
deference
to
the
trial
court
decision.
even
in
irvin
v.
dowd
there
is
a
citation
to
the
reynolds
case
and
to
holt
indicating
once
again
that
unless
the
error
is
manifest
as
shown
by
the
record
before
this
particular
court,
that
the
court
should
defer
to
that
particular
case.
as
i
mentioned,
since
the
2254
came
into
effect,
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
dealt
with
this
particular
issue
once
again,
initially
in
sumner
v.
mata
which
was
once
again
a
mixed
question
as
to
fact
and
law
dealing
with
a
photographic
display
to
various
witnesses.
there
were
several
questions
addressed
at
that
particular
time,
in
particular
dealing
with
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
identification
as
to
whether
the
victim
had
sufficient
time
in
order
to
accurately
see
what
occurred
and
who
her
assailants
were,
or
the
assailants
were,
whether
the
witness
failed
to
give
an
adequate
description
to
the
authorities,
and
thirdly,
whether
there
was
any
pressure
placed
upon
the
individual
by
prison
officials
in
order
to
get
him
to
identify
this
particular
individual.
now,
this
court
has
on
two
occasions
with
regard
to
sumner
v.
mata
addressed
this
particular
issue.
initially
in
1981
the
court
vacated
the
decision,
remanded
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
purposes
of
applying
a
2254
analysis
to
these
particular
matters.
the
court
of
appeals
retained
jurisdiction,
rendered
its
decision.
the
issue
came
back
up
before
this
particular
court
once
again
in
sumner
v.
mata
in
1962,
i
believe,
and
it
was
once
again
vacated
and
remanded
by
this
court
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
improperly
applied
2254
to
this
factual
determination.
in
marshall
v.
longberger,
as
i
have
mentioned
to
the
court
this
morning
or
this
afternoon,
that
was
a
case
dealing
with
a
murder
prosecution
where
the
state
or
the
commonwealth
attempted
to
use
a
prior
conviction
of
the
individual
in
order
to
fit
it
into
its
aggravated
circumstances
range
such
that
they
could
gain
the
death
penalty.
with
regard
to
that
particular
case,
the
court
has
held
that
a
federal
court
has
no
license
to
redetermine
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals,
what
they
have
done
there
was
they
attempted
to
redetermine
whether
this
individual's
plea
of
guilt
in
another
state
which
was
used
for
purposes
of
attempting
to
gain
this
conviction,
whether
that
was
voluntarily
entered.
they
went
into
great
depth
dealing
with
the
guilty
plea
colloquy,
etcetera.
and
this
court
indicated
that
the
federal
courts
shouldn't
redetermine
that
issue
as
to
credibility,
they
should
allow
it
to
stand
and
accord
it
the
deference
of
2254(d).
and
most
recently,
in
the
case
of
busham
v.
spain
in
this
court
in
1983,
december
of
1983,
in
this
particular
case,
a
juror
who
was
on
a
case
subsequently
realized
during
the
course
of
the
testimony
that
she
had
some
knowledge
at
to
the
victim
involved
in
another
homicide
which
indirectly
related
to
this
particular
case
through
one
of
the
witnesses.
she
had
some
ex
parte
discussions
with
the
court
with
regard
to
that,
and
the
record
indicates
that
more
or
less
he
indicated
as
long
as
it
is
not
brought
up
again,
i
don't
think
you
have
a
problem.
however,
defense
counsel
after
the
conviction
discovered
that
this
occurred.
obviously
he
filed
a
petition
before
the
court,
a
hearing
was
held,
and
the
court
at
that
particular
time...
this
is
the
lower
court,
the
trial
court...
made
a
determination
with
regard
to
that
particular
juror
that
her...
she
was
not
biased,
she
was
not
prejudiced
as
a
result
of
that.
this
court,
upon
reviewing
that,
held
in
essence
that
this
was
a
determination
of
fact
because
it
dealt
with
impartiality,
it
dealt
with
the
credibility
to
be
accorded
that
particular
witness.
so
the
petitioners
before
this
court
at
this
particular
time
would
assert
to
this
court
that
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
a
question
as
to
this
credibility,
and
who
better
to
make
a
determination
as
to--
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
--certainly.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes.
in
essence
with
regard
to
mr.
hrin,
who
is
the
major
problem
for
the
prosecution
in
this
particular
case,
his
voir
dire
examination,
the
trial
court
did
not
specifically
refer
to
his
testimony
in
any
of
its
opinions.
it
indicated
i
believe
once
as
the
respondents
have
brought
up,
as
the
trial
court
said
at
one
point
that
most
if
not
all
of
the
individuals
seated
had
a...
did
not
have
a
fixed
opinion.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
which
under
sumner
v.
mata
is
a
state
court
determination,
their
review
on
appeal,
did
specifically
state
that
with
regard
to
mr.
hrin
and
the
other
individuals...
they
did
not
mention
mr.
hrin's
name
in
essence,
but
they
did
state
that
upon
their
independent
review
as
to
mr.
hrin
and
all
the
others,
they
could
find
no
problems
not
only
with
regard
to
whether
a
change
of
venue
could
be
required,
or
as
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
challenges
for
cause
were
improperly
resolved
by
the
court.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
--no,
he
did
not
specifically
address
that.
the
petitioner's
position
with
regard
to
that
particular
matter,
and
in
specific,
with
regard
to
mr.
hrin,
we
did
not
feel
that
he
entered
the
jury
box
with
an
opinion.
the
testimony
at
the
voir
dire
obviously
is
ambiguous.
at
one
print
he
said
i
can
enter
with
an
open
mind.
in
the
next
sentence,
practically,
he
says
that
he
would
require
some
evidence
before
he
would
charge
his
opinion.
it
certainly
is
ambiguous.
what
we
would
submit
to
the
court
are
two
things
with
regard
to
that.
first
of
all,
as
to
his
testimony
that
he
would
require
some
evidence,
he
has
never
indicated
that
he
would
require
some
evidence
by
either
the
prosecution
or
the
defense
to
change
that.
he
simply
says
that
he
would
enter
the
box
with
an
open
mind.
at
one
point
he
does
indicate
in
the
voir
dire
examination
that
he
would
listen
to
the
evidence
presented
and
decide
the
case
solely
on
the
evidence
and
the
facts
presented
to
the
court.
we
would
submit
that
he
did
not
enter
with
an
opinion.
he
entered
to
the
extent
where
he
said,
hey,
i
have
heard
this
publicity
to
some
extent.
my
opinion
that
i
had
was
based
upon
what
i
have
read
in
the
paper,
et
cetera.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
i
do
have
an
opinion.
i
cannot
go
in
there
and
totally
cleanse
myself
of
any
thought
of
it.
it
is
still
there
regardless.
however,
be
indicated
that
once
evidence
has
started
to
be
presented,
we
submit
once
the
prosecution
started
to
present
evidence,
he
will
begin
to
develop
with
his
open
mind
an
analysis
as
to
that,
he
would
look
at
it
as
to
an
open
mind.
judge
charry
in
his
denial
of
the
challenge
for
cause
in
essence
based
it
upon
the
fact
that
he
said
that
he
could
go
in
with
an
open
mind.
however,
even
after
that
challenge
for
cause,
what
occurred
was
that
defense
counsel
continue
to
question
mr.
hrin
when
on
questioning
him
after
that
point,
and
on
page
89a
of
the
record
before
this
particular
court,
he
questioned
with
mr.
hrin
with
a,
in
essence
a
double
question.
he
asked
him
whether
he
could
set
aside
his
opinion,
whether
it
was
solid,
unsolid,
or
however
you
wish
to
describe
it,
or
whether
he
could
enter
the
jury
box
and
would
need
some
evidence
before
he
could
change
his
mind,
and
he
asked
him
to
think
about
it
beforehand.
in
response
to
that,
he
said
i
have
to.
defense
counsel
said
is
that
a
yes
or
a
no,
or
could
i
please
have
a
yes
or
no,
and
he
said
i
think
i
could
enter
it
with
a
very
open
mind.
and
then
he
related
it
to
some
of
the
requirements
of
his
day-to-day
use,
he
being
a
chemist.
he
indicated
that
oftentimes,
whenever
you
go
into
a
procedure
believing
or
even
thinking
that
a
certain
outcome
was
going
to
come,
even
time
tested
tests
that
he
has
run
before,
during
the
course
of
that
test
circumstances
charge,
things
are
shown
to
him
through
those
tests
which
make
him
change
his
mind
as
to
what
the
proper
analysis
would
be.
with
regard
to
mr.
hrin's
specific,
we
would
indicate
to
the
court
that
although
the
defense
did
challenge
him
for
cause,
as
i
have
indicated,
and
it
was
denied,
they
continued
to
question
him,
and
at
that
time
we
would
submit
he
did
give
a
proper
response.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes,
they
did,
but
they
did
not
mention
this
very
specifically.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
okay.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
on
habeas
in
the
united
states
district
court,
even
in
the
initial
pro
se
petition
filed
by
mr.
yount
in
this
case,
he
was
mentioned
specifically.
the
district
court
opinion
addresses
not
only
mr.
hrin
but
all
the
jurors
individually
and
sets
forth
within
his
opinion
various
points
of
their
voir
dire
examination
that
he
feels
are
appropriate
to
establish
whether
they
do
or
do
not
have
an
opinion.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
in
essence,
the
unexhausted
claims
basically
dealt
with
his
counsel
and
the
fact
that
he
had
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
you
are
correct
under
rose
v.
lundy,
the
district
court
gave
him
the
option
as
to
whether
he
wished
to
either
amend
his
petition
at
that
time
or
withdraw
it
and
proceed
to
exhaust
his
state
court
remedies.
i
do
not
recall
as
to
whether
he
specifically
addressed
that
his
counsel
was
ineffective
due
to
a
failure
to
either
further
challenge
mr.
hrin
after
these
statements
or
not.
in
essence,
with
regard
to
mr.
hrin,
however,
after
that
initial
challenge
for
cause
was
denied
and
he
was
questioned
and
gave
a
proper
response,
what
occurred
was
the
defense
counsel
subsequently
accepted
him
as
a
juror
even
though
they
did
have
peremptory
challenges
still
remaining
to
them
at
that
particular
time.
what
i
think
is
important
in
this
case,
however,
and
we
shouldn't
lose
sight
of
it,
is
nine
of
the
jurors
were
accepted
by
the
defense
without
challenges
of
any
kind,
either
challenges
for
cause
or
peremptorily.
with
regard
to
those
particular
challenges,
it's
important
to
note
that
one
of
the
challenges
was
used
as
to
mr.
hrin,
the
challenge
for
cause.
the
other
two
came
with
regard
to
the
last
two
actual
jurors
who
were
selected.
those
particular
individuals
had
even
indicated
on
their
voir
dire
that
they
had
no
particular
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
this
individual.
however,
the
defense,
since
they
were
out
of
peremptories,
did
challenge
them
for
cause,
and
those
were
denied.
those
are
the
three
challenges
for
cause
by
the
defense
with
regard
to
this
particular
jury.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
at
the
close
of
the
jury
selection
of
the
actual
jury
itself,
not
dealing
with
the
alternates,
but
the
actual
jury
itself,
no,
they
did
not
have
peremptories
left.
they
had
used
them
all.
the
last
two
individuals
who
were
placed
on
the
jury
were
placed
there
after
they
had
exhausted,
and
the
defense
merely
challenged
for
cause
on
whatever
basis,
i'm
not
sure,
in
essence,
that
they
had
an
opinion.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes,
they
had
more
than
one.
they
had
quite
a
few
left
to
them
at
that
particular
time.
in
essence,
your
honors,
once
a
determination
is
made
with
regard
to
the
issue
as
to
what
deference
or
what
is
begun
with
the
state
court
determination
as
to
juror
impartiality,
at
that
point
then
we
must
apply
the
test
as
to
pretrial
publicity,
etcetera,
to
determine
what
if
anything
had
occurred
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
in
essence
they
indicate
they
apply
an
irvin
analysis.
however,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
more
or
less
misconstrued
here.
the
court
of
appeals
placed
great
reliance
upon
the
number
of
individuals
that
were
excluded,
upon
the
overall
picture,
the
overall
publicity,
the
number
of
individuals
that
were
challenged
for
cause,
and
the
percentage.
i
believe
they
indicated
it
was
something
like
77
percent.
however,
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
irvin
v.
dowd.
first
of
all,
this
case
as
a
case
that
falls
under
2254(d),
and
dependent
upon
this
court's
decision
as
to
whether
this
is
a
question
of
fact
or
mixed
question,
we
get
into
the
area
as
to
what
is
to
happen
after
2254(d)
with
regard
to
cases
such
as
irvin
v.
dowd.
the
instant
case
involves
a
situation
where
the
actual
counsel
conducted
the
voir
dire
examination.
in
irvin
v.
dowd
the
judge
himself
conducted
voir
dire
examination.
in
irvin
v.
dowd,
we
have
to
look
at
the
scope
of
the
voir
dire
allowed.
obviously
in
this
case
we
did
not
have
voir
dire
as
long
as
was
exhibited
in
irvin
v.
dowd.
however,
in
essence,
what
occurred
was
since
counsel
was
themselves
conducting
it,
there
were
many
leading
questions,
there
was
great
leniency
given
to
both
counsel
with
regard
to
their
conduct
of
voir
dire.
i
think
even
the
court
of
appeals
does
indicate
that
great
leniency
was
given.
that
is
what
led,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
to
the
lengthy
voir
dire,
this
constant
bickering.
if
you
look
at
the
total
voir
dire,
there
is
constant
bickering
back
and
forth
between
counsel
and
the
court
as
to
what
the
extent
of
the
voir
dire
should
be,
how
far
it
should
go,
whether
questions
have
been
asked
and
answered,
constantly,
over
and
over
again.
so
the
scope
of
the
voir
dire
is
different,
and
also
we
have
a
difference
in
the
degree
of
publicity.
in
irvin
v.
dowd,
the
very
day
before
he
went
to
trial,
there
was
a
newspaper
article
published
that
indicated
he
had
confessed
to
the
crime
involved
in
that
particular
case.
in
the
yount
case,
basically
the
press
that
occurred
just
prior
to
trial,
yes,
it
did
indicate
that
this
was
a
retrial
that
was
coming
once
again
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
clearfield
county,
but
in
essence,
what
it
did
at
that
particular
time
was
basically
factual
indications.
there
is
a
great
dispute
even
with
the
basic
factual
determinations
to
which
we
are
certain
2254
apply.
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
there
were
66
newspaper
article
in
between
the
end
of
the
second
trial
and
the
beginning
of
the...
excuse
me,
between
the
end
of
the
first
trial
and
the
beginning
of
the
second
trial.
in
our
brief
we
submit
to
the
court
that
there
were
15.
what
has
occurred
here
is,
and
in
judge
charry's
opinions
he
also,
i
believe
he
says
17,
what
has
occurred
here
is
that
we
are
trying
to
compare
apples
with
oranges
more
or
less.
the
court
of
appeals
is
looking
from
the
end
of
the
first
trial
to
the
commencement
of
testimony
in
the
second
trial.
judge
charry
in
his
opinions
which
they
hold
are
erroneous
because
he
does
not
come
up
with
the
same
66,
he
is
indicating
from
the
end
of
the
first
trial
to
the
beginning
of
jury
selection.
granted,
there
were
a
lot
of
articles
published
during
the
course
of
the
voir
dire.
several
panels
were
exhausted
during
the
course
of
the
voir
dire
examination.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
okay.
the
commission
of
the
crime
occurred
april
of
1966.
the
second
trial
went
to
trial
with
the
jury
verdict
being
returned
november
20
of
1970.
in
essence
we
have
four
years.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes,
it
was.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
stevens.
as
an
individual
was
selected
for
voir
dire,
he
was
sequestered.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
the
voir
dire
lasted,
and
once
again,
that
is
subject
to
question
by
various
people...
the
voir
dire
lasted,
the
petitioners
would
assert,
seven
and
a
half
days.
i
believe
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
lasted
eleven
or
twelve
days.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
yes.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
what
we
have
to
look
at,
though,
is
at
the
beginning,
the
very
beginning
of
voir
dire,
the
court--
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
--i
believe
it
is
pennsylvania,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
with
regard
to
the
jury
selection,
in
essence,
what
occurred
there
was...
and
there
is
great
dispute--
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
--your
honor,
i
would
not
hedge
to
make
a
guess
at
that.
with
regard
to
the
selection,
as
i
indicated,
and
with
regard
to
this,
the
court
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
selection
process
instructed
the
persons
on
the
first
panel
that
they
should
not
read
any
press
with
regard
to
the
case.
it
is
correct
that
some
of
the
very
last
jurors
were
selected
from
subsequent
panels
who
would
have
had
a
chance
to
review
it
not
knowing
that
they
were
even
involved
in
the
particular
proceeding.
i
believe
the
testimony,
however,
given
at
the
time
indicated
that
their
knowledge
as
to
the
case
recently
was
basically
that
it
was
coming
up,
that
the
jury
selection
was
going
on
with
regard
to
the
particular
case,
not
in
essence
as
to
the
first
trial
or
otherwise--
i
believe
the
total
concept
of
the
testimony
given
with
regard
to
the
selection
of
jurors
indicates
that
in
essence
they
were
aware
of
the
case
from
the
prior
publicity
that
was
given
to
it
more
than
the
most
recent
publicity
that
it
was
coming
once
again
to
a
new
trial.
returning
back
to
the
publicity
issue,
there
are
basically
two
manners
in
which
this
court
has
indicated
publicity
is
reviewed,
an
utterly
corrupt
the
trial
standard,
which
is
estes
v.
texas,
sheppard
case,
etcetera,
and
all
the
courts
have
agreed
there
was
not
this
type
of
publicity
with
regard
to
this
case,
or
of
an
actual
prejudice
claim.
that
is
where
the
court
of
appeals
bases
their
particular
decision
that
the
publicity
was
so
extensive,
that
it
so
inflamed
the
members
of
the
jury
with
regard
to
this
and
the
whole
community
as
a
whole
that
as
a
result
of
that
and
looking
at
the
individuals
and
the
sheer
number
of
individuals
that
either
indicated
they
knew
about
the
case,
had
some
opinion
about
the
case,
that
the
sworn
testimony
of
the
individuals
as
a
result
of
their
process
of
selection
of
the
jury,
should
be
disregarded
or
should
be
more
or
less
looked
at
in
a
different
light,
i
guess
the
court
would
say.
with
regard
to
that
actual
prejudice
claim,
then,
the
petitioners
would
assert
to
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
actually
apply
irvin
v.
dowd.
they
looked
at
irvin
v.
dowd,
they
placed
their
decision
upon
irvin
v.
dowd,
but
due
to
the
differences
between
irvin
v.
dowd
and
this
case,
and
the
impact
of
2254(d)
on
the
deference
to
be
given
to
a
state
court
determination,
they
did
no
in
essence
apply
a
full
analysis
with
regard
to
this
case.
your
honors,
in
conclusion
at
this
particular
point,
the
petitioners
would
respectfully
request
that
this
particular
court
find
that
a
state
court
determination
as
to
juror
impartiality
is
a
factual
determination.
it
is
a
determination
based
by
the
trial
court
upon
the
credibility
of
those
particular
individuals,
and
that
based
upon
that
particular
finding
of
this
court,
that
2254(d)
does
apply,
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
due
to
them
not
properly
applying
2254(d).
they
do
technically
make
reference
to
it
in
footnote
20,
i
believe.
they
go
on
in
footnotes
21
and
22
to
talk
about
their
application
of
it
to
this
particular
case,
so
technically
they
have
complied,
they
have
gone
a
little
bit
further
and
attempted
to
indicate
their
analysis.
however,
with
regard
to
those
items
that
they
address
and
the
items
that
they
seem
to
indicate
that
they
found
error
in
the
factual
determination
of
the
court,
it
is
items
as
to
the
number
of
newspaper
articles
involved;
it
is
items
as
to
whether
there
were
spectators
in
the
courtroom
or
not.
all
these
things
go
into
their
analysis
as
to
the
publicity
issue.
but
they
do
not
specifically
deal
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
this
issue
as
to
the
individuals
selected
for
the
jury
and
whether
their
examination
shows
that
they
were
biased
or
unbiased.
mr.
chief
justice,
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
wish
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
f.
cortez
bell,
iii
not
unless
the
court
has
any
specific
questions,
your
honor.
