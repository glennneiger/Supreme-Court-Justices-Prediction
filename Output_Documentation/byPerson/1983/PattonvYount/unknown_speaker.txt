unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
fact,
yes.
unknown
speaker
this
was
at
the
second
state
trial,
was
it
not,
mr.
bell?
unknown
speaker
fourteen
years
ago?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct
that
this,
the
act
charged
in
the
indictment
occurred
in
1966?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question,
mr.
bell?
unknown
speaker
judge
garth
in
his
concurrence
concentrated
on
the
one
juror,
i
think
his
name
was
hrin
or
some
such
name.
unknown
speaker
and
as
to
him,
he
said
there
was
no
fact
problem
because
the
district,
or
the
state
judge
didn't
make
any
finding
concerning
him.
how
does
your
argument...
does
your
argument
respond
to
judge
garth's
concern?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
justice
roberts
didn't
mention
the
problem
that
juror
hrin
had
a
predisposition
to
find
the
man
guilty
and
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
explain
why
he
was
innocent.
unknown
speaker
justice
roberts
didn't
mention
that
problem,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
did
the
respondent
appeal
the
trial
court's
denial
of
the
challenge
for
cause
to
juror
hrin
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
mention
him
specifically?
unknown
speaker
how
about
on
habeas
to
the
united
states
district
court?
unknown
speaker
was
juror
hrin
mentioned
specifically?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
also
denied
a
motion
to
amend
the
habeas
petition
for
failure
to
exhaust
claims.
did
any
of
those
unexhausted
claims
relate
to
juror
hrin
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
you
say
at
the
close
of
the
jury
selection
the
defense
had
still
available
to
it
unexhausted
peremptory
challenges?
unknown
speaker
but
at
the
time
mr.
hrin
was
placed
on
the
jury,
at
that
time
they
did
have
a
peremptory
challenge.
unknown
speaker
how
long
was
it
between
the
first
and
the
second,
or
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
the
second
trial?
unknown
speaker
four
years,
four
years.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
on
the
voir
dire,
the
jury
was
sequestered
during
the
trial,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
not
during...
the
people
who
were
on
the
venire
were
not
sequestered
until
after
they
were
chosen?
is
that
how
it
was
done?
unknown
speaker
but
then
that
would
mean
that
all
the
stories...
and
the
voir
dire
lasted
for
how
long?
unknown
speaker
well,
say
it
was
seven
days
for
the
purpose
of
my
question.
unknown
speaker
but
the
jurors
who
were
not
selected
until
the
end
of
the
seven
days
would
have
read
the
stories
presumably
during
the
first
five
or
six
days.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
where
did
you
learn
to
pronounce
voir
dire
the
way
you
pronounce
it?
unknown
speaker
oh.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
right?
unknown
speaker
in
what
year,
1966?
unknown
speaker
and
now
you're
trying
the
case
four
years
later.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
they
recall
the
facts
of
the
case,
they
recall
that
there
was
such
a
case
is
what
you
mean,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
not
all
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schumacher,
i
think
one
of
your
opponent's
positions
is
that
if
one
takes
juror
hrin's
various
answers,
as
the
first
questioned
by
the
defense,
then
by
the
prosecution,
one
gets
several
different
versions
of
an
answer
to
that
question,
that
admittedly
that
answer
was
given,
but
also
something
that
could
be
called
contradictory
to
it.
why
isn't
that
an
ambiguity
in
his
overall
testimony
that
is
best
resolved
by
the
trial
judge?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
under...
after
our
decision
in
sumner
v.
mata
and
after
congress
changed
the
statute
in
1966.
if
ever
there's
a
question
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
whether
a
particular
juryman
had
a
fixed
opinion
about
a
particular
set
of
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
but,
you're
an
experience
trial
lawyer,
mr.
schumacher.
if
you
had
your
choice
between
taking
the
resolution
of
a
controversy
like
that
from
someone
who
sat
right
there
and
heard
the
venireman
answer
questions,
saw
the
demeanor,
and
had...
or
the
choice
of
taking
the
resolution
of
it
by
another
experienced
judge
sitting
in
philadelphia
and
reading
a
record,
which
one
would
you
take,
assuming
they
were
both
equally
competent?
unknown
speaker
but
if
a
juryman
says
the
defense
is
going
to
have
to
shake
me
before
i'll
find
him
innocent,
wouldn't
he
be
challengeable
for
cause?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
this--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
that
what
this
man
said?
unknown
speaker
and
you
got
rid
of
a
great
many
of
them
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
test
we
employ
one
of
whether
the
trial
judge
committed
manifest
error
when
he
determined
that
the
jurors
ware
impartial?
is
that
our
test?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
to
juror
hrin,
you
had
him
answering
a
question,
for
instance,
by
saying
i
would
enter
it,
meaning
the
jury
box,
with
an
open
mind.
there
was
a
lengthy
colloquy
in
the
questions
and
answers,
and
he
gave
answers
which
on
balance
perhaps
could
lead
the
judge
to
find
did
not
demonstrate
any
kind
of
bias.
how,
how
can
we
justify
overturning
the
trial
court's
determination
on
habeas?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
on
habeas
specifically
address
the
cause
challenge
to
juror
hrin?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
was
it,
was
it
specifically
raised
in
the
petition
for
habeas?
unknown
speaker
as
to
hrin?
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
record
does
it
show
that?
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
a
chance
before
you
are
through,
i
would
appreciate
the
page
reference.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
don't
you
think
in
all
fairness
we
have
to
look
at
the
entire
exchange
on
voir
dire
relating
to
juror
hrin,
at
all
points
where
that
juror
was
questioned?
unknown
speaker
if
this
challenge...
was
this
challenge
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
was
the
argument
which
prevailed
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
that
juror
hrin's
testimony
on
voir
dire
should
have
disqualified...
was
that
challenge
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
if
it
wasn't
made
there,
why
wasn't
it
waived
under
wainwright
v.
sykes?
unknown
speaker
but
none
of
those
sound
like
the
same
issue...
those
sound
like
kind
of
a
bath
of
publicity
over
the
community
as
a
whole
rather
than
focusing
on
one
particular
juror
and
saying
from
his
transcript
of
voir
dire
we
can
tell
he
shouldn't
have
been
seated.
was
the
latter
point
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
have
examined
the
record
and
it
doesn't
tell
us
the
answer
to
that
question.
unknown
speaker
and
you
will
let
me
know
if
you
find
where
juror
hrin
was...
that
issue
was
raised
before
the
district
court,
right?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
way
we
pronounce
it
out
in
minnesota,
too,
so
you're
all
right.
i
think
it's
the
way
we
pronounce
it
here
even.
unknown
speaker
well,
look
at
the
paragraph
following
it
at
302a.
despite
the
fact
that
all
indicated
they
would
judge
the
case
on
the
evidence,
two
stated
that
they
would
require
petitioner
to
prove
his
innocence.
does
that
refer
to
him?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
next
sentence.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
reference
more
fairly
be
read
as
challenging
jurors
no.
2
and
10
who
expressed
confusion
over
whether
the
defendant
had
to
prove
his
innocence?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
refer,
then,
to
jurors
2
and
10
and
not
to
hrin,
who
was
no.
6?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
briefs,
did
you
have
briefs
at
the
habeas
corpus?
did
you
have
any
written
arguments?
unknown
speaker
did
you
mention
this
specific
juror?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
what
your
petition
said.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
arguments
in
the
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
were
there
briefs?
unknown
speaker
did
they
ever
mention
this
particular
juror
by
name
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
they
aren't
in
the
record
here,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
could
call
for
them,
i
suppose.
did
your
opponent
contend
that
you
didn't
exhaust
your
state
remedies?
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
here,
the
case
will
go
back
and
possibly
a
new
trial,
what,
in
1984,
and
then
an
appeal
from
that
if
there's
a
similar
verdict?
that
would
be
1985
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
and
1986
or
1987
back
up
here
perhaps.
quite
a
long
time
for
a
criminal
case
to
be
in
the
courts,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schumacher,
where
has
this
man
been
all
this
time?
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
incarcerated
since
19...
when?
unknown
speaker
so
the
delay
really
hasn't
done
him
very
much
good,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
longer
the
time,
the
greater
the
injustice?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
10:00.
