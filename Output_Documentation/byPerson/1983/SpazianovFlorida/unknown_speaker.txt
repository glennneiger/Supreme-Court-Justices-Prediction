unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
the
judge
was
not
privy,
the
judge
was
there
when
the
penalty
jury
took
place,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
judge
never
is,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
and
the
jury...
i
see
your
point.
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
counsel,
what's
the
consequence
of
your
prevailing?
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
on
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence.
would
that
be
of
any--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
barnard,
you're
arguing
two
quite
separate
points,
though,
aren't
you?
that
wouldn't
be
true
of
both
of
your
points,
would
it?
you
have
a
lesser
included
offense
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
and
also
you
argue
that
the
jury
should
not
have
been
overridden
on
the
penalty
phase.
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
latter,
you
wouldn't
want
to
get
a
new
trial,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
result
in
keeble,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
inference
is
that
the
federal
court,
despite
the
lack
of
jurisdiction,
could
find
him
guilty,
try
him
and
find
him
guilty
of
the
lesser
included
facts.
he
didn't
go
free.
at
least
there
is
nothing...
or
did
he?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
here,
there
was
no
request
for
lesser
included
offense
instructions,
in
your
case?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
now
saying
that
there
should
have
been
such
an
instruction,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
have
had
the
judge
charge
the
jury
on
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
also
tell
the
jury
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run,
and
that
no
judgment
could
be
entered
on
the
verdict
if
they
returned
a
verdict
of
that
kind?
unknown
speaker
then
you'd
have
the
judge
charge
the
jury,
and
give
the
jury
the
impression
that
the
defendant
could
be
sentenced
if
they
returned
a
verdict
on
the
lesser
included
offense,
even
though,
in
fact,
the
defendant
couldn't
be
sentenced.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
theory
of
a
lesser
included
offense
charge
is
that
the
jury
may
be
willing,
in
a
doubtful
case,
may
be
willing
to
find
someone
guilty
of
a
lesser
included
offense
rather
than
a
greater
offense,
if
they
think
they
have
that
option,
rather
than
just
the
option
between
acquitting
and
finding
guilty
of
the
greater
offense,
isn't
it
a
little
inconsistent
to
give
the
jury
the
impression
that
they
can
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
this
lesser
offense,
and
that
there
will
be
punishment
for
it
when,
in
fact,
there
can't
be
any?
unknown
speaker
and
another
of
which
is
to
indict
sooner
than
it
did.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
if
the
statute
weren't
present,
your
client
would
have
been
entitled,
i
take
it,
to
the
lesser
included
offense
instructions.
unknown
speaker
was
he
asked
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
role
in
florida
for
the
jury
to
make
determinations
in
connection
with
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
or
point?
unknown
speaker
is
that
only
if
there's
a
factual
dispute
in
connection
with
it?
how
would
the
jury
be
involved
in
determining
the
statute
of
limitations
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
itself
would
determine,
as
a
matter
of
law,
whether
the
statute
had
run.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
there
is
any
possibility
that
if
this
instruction
had
been
given
and
the
verdicts
had
been
returned
on
the
lesser
included
offense
or
offenses,
that
he
could
have
been
sentenced
on
them?
unknown
speaker
no,
of
course
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
either
run
or
it
hadn't,
and
that
was
not
difficult
to
determine
with
the
aid
of
a
calendar,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
in
florida,
suppose
the
instruction
had
been
given
and
the
jury
had
found
guilt
of
a
lesser
included
offense.
would
the
jury
in
florida...
the
jury
then
do
that
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
who
does?
the
judge
does?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
vote
of
the
jury
was
on
the
life
sentence?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
florida
law,
would
it
be
lawful,
would
it
be
possible
to
know,
unless
the
jury
foreman
reported
it
affirmatively
to
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
a
judge
instructs
the
jury
foreman
not
to
disclose
the
exact
vote.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
just
one
other
question,
because
i
don't
remember.
under
florida
law,
for
them
to
recommend
life,
what
vote
is
required?
does
the
majority
have
to
vote
in
favor
of
life?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
it
took
7
for
life,
at
least.
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnard,
are
you
making
any
claim
that
the
state
purposefully
delayed
this
case
until
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
on
the
lesser
offenses?
unknown
speaker
would
your
case
be
different
if
you
could
prove
that?
or
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
be
any
stronger?
all
you
have
to
do
is
waive
the
statute.
i
mean
you
could
protect
yourself
from
that.
unknown
speaker
it
just
cancels
out
the
delay
is
all
it
does.
i
don't
see
any
harsh
penalty
about
that.
if
they're
deliberately
delaying
so
that
you'll
have
a
defense
you
wouldn't
otherwise
have,
then
you
waive
the
defense,
it
seems
to
me
you're
back
where
you
started
from.
unknown
speaker
when
the
state
legislature,
as
apparently
the
florida
state
legislature
has
done,
gives
the
judge
that
power,
are
they
not
saying
in
so
many
words
that
the
jury
is
permitted
to
make
a
recommendation
to
the
judge
for
whatever
use
the
judge
wants
to
make
of
that
recommendation.
isn't
that
what
it
amounts
to?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
effect
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
legislature
had,
in
so
many
words,
expressly
said
the
jury,
at
its
option,
may
recommend
to
the
judge
the
sentence
to
be
given,
but
the
judge
shall
have
sole
and
final
power?
would
you
have
any
problem
with
that
kind
of
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
a
judge
should
never
be
entitled
to
sentence
anybody
to
death:
that
the
jury
in
a
death
case...
it
always
has
to
be
the
jury
that
is
given
the
sentencing
authority.
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
i
know
that's
the
question,
but
your
submission
really
is
that
the
judge
should
not
be
able
to
sentence
a
person
to
death.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
as
you
know,
jury
sentencing
is
not
the
uniform
rule
of
this
nation
of
ours.
there
are
a
lot
of
states
where
juries
don't
sentence
at
all.
unknown
speaker
your
theory
would
outlaw
judge
sentencing
in
all
crimes,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
your
argument,
mr.
barnard,
that
for
a
special
theory
in
capital
cases,
that
the
jury
is
a
more
reliable
sentencer,
or
that
you
have
to
have
perhaps
both
a
judge
and
jury
agree?
i
am
not
sure
which
it
is.
do
you
understand
my
question?
unknown
speaker
what
if
florida
set
up
a
system
that
just
said
the
jury
shall
find
on
the
question
of
guilt
and
innocence,
and
then
will
have
another
trial,
and
that
will
all
be
before
a
judge
on
whether
the
death
penalty
should
be
imposed?
that
would
not
offend
your
theory.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
the
jury
found
the
person
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
or
capital
homicide
whatever
the
state
called
it.
but
then
all
the
sentencing
trial
was
conducted
before
a
judge,
without
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
the
jury
factor,
and
not
the
kind
of
two
bites
at
the
apple
factor
you're
arguing
for.
you're
not
arguing
that
both
a
judge
and
a
jury
must
concur.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
bullington
was
just
describing
the
missouri
procedure.
i
didn't
think
that
it
said
that,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
procedure,
a
judge
had
to
be
permitted
to
overrule
a
jury.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
if
a
jury
didn't
return
anything
except
the
verdict
on
whether
the
person
was
guilty
of
the
offense,
and
then
the
sentencing
was
turned
over
to
a
judge?
you
still
say
that
could
not
be
done.
unknown
speaker
you
are
aware
that
a
number
of
states
do
that
precise
thing,
and
have
a
judge
determine
the
sentence
in
a
capital
case
at
a
separate
hearing,
with
no
jury
determination.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
your
position
that
all
those
states
are
operating
under
unconstitutional
procedures.
unknown
speaker
you
said
there
are
four
states
with
a
jury...
with
an
override
provision?
unknown
speaker
there
are
four
states.
how
many
have
an
override
provision,
as
florida
does?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
a
total
of
seven
states
in
which
the
jury
does
not
actually
make
the
decision,
or
is
there
a
double-counting
in
there?
unknown
speaker
and
of
those
31,
in
how
many
must
the
jury
be
unanimous?
unknown
speaker
well,
never
mind.
i'll
find
it
if
it's
in
the
papers.
unknown
speaker
what's
your
basic
theory?
i
kind
of
know
what
you
want
to
win,
but
i
don't
really
understand
what
your
theory
is.
why
should
the
jury
make
this
determination,
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
the
different
theories
of
punishment
that
are
at
stake
in
the
death
case,
as
opposed
to
other
cases?
you
don't
sees
awfully
enthusiastic
about
your
position,
to
be
very
candid
with
you.
i
don't
really
understand
your
argument
from
what
you
said
orally.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
just
retribution.
it's
also
deterrence
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
community.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
irony
of
your
position,
if
you
really
mean
it,
is
that
a
judge
would
never
have
a
role
in
whether
or
not
to
impose
a
death
penalty,
and
if
the
jury
imposed
the
death
penalty,
he
could
not
override
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
the
jury
is
the
sole
sentencer
under
the
eighth
amendment.
what
business
has
a
judge
got
overruling
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
arguing
that
a
judge
should
have
the
power
to
overrule
the
jury
only
one
way?
that
is,
if
the
jury
makes
the
wrong
decision.
unknown
speaker
but,
general
menser,
isn't
it
true
that
all
those
things
could
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
at
the
first
hearing?
unknown
speaker
but
did
the
prosecutor
try
to
submit
those
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
isn't
this
sort
of
the
other
side
of
the
coin
on
the
first
point?
they
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
present
it
to
the
jury,
and
elected
not
to
do
so.
unknown
speaker
but
ruled
erroneously
as
a
matter
of
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
you
kind
of
want
it
both
ways.
you
can't
say
the
jury
didn't
have
a
fair...
you
know,
they
considered
everything
the
state
submitted
to
them.
and
if
the
state
didn't
submit
more
evidence,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
the
jury
didn't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
judge
the
question
of
life
or
death.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
sentenced
to
death
in
that
proceeding
also.
unknown
speaker
the
net
result
is
that
the
trial
judge
overruled
the
jury
twice.
the
jury
recommended
life,
the
only
opportunity
it
had
to
pass
on
the
question.
and
the
judge
overruled
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
blame
the
defendant
for
that,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
still,
that's
the
issue
in
the
case
as
to
whether
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
and
i
understand
you,
of
course,
think
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
opposition
says
that
a
jury
do
the
sentencing
in
this
case,
and
if
florida
purports
to
put
the
decision
in
the
hands
of
a
judge,
it's
wrong,
it's
not
complying
with
the
constitution.
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
inquire?
you
say
there
are
120
cases
where
the
judge
followed
the
jury's
recommendation
or
advisory
verdict
of
death,
and
80
where
they
overrode.
how
many
are
there
in
which
the
judge
or
jury
recommended
death,
and
the
judge
overruled
and
gave
life?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
effect,
the
way
it
seems
to
work
out
is
if
the
jury
recommends
death,
it's
going
to
be
death.
and
if
the
jury
recommends
life,
there
may
be
a
second
opportunity
for
the
state
to
impose
the
death
sentence.
unknown
speaker
those
statistics
you
were
citing
were
just
from
the
people
on
death
row
who,
i
suppose,
by
definition,
end
up
with
a
death
sentence.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
question
about
it,
because
i
am
somewhat
interested
in
the
question
whether
it's
appropriate
to
impose
a
death
sentence
when
the
jury
has
apparently
unanimously
recommended
life,
which
is
fair
to
infer,
i
think,
from
the
promptness
with
which
they
acted
here.
what
is
the
rationale
for
the
death
penalty,
for
florida's
death
penalty?
is
it
rehabilitation?
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
not
be
protected
by
incarceration
for
life,
without
possibility
of
parole,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
retribution
is
a
significant
factor
in
florida's
scheme?
unknown
speaker
this
is
why
some
penologists
have
said
that
the
death
sentence
should
be
imposed
for
prisoners,
life
prisoners
who
commit
a
murder
within
the
prison
or
in
the
process
of
escape...
limiting
the
death
sentence
to
that
narrow
category,
because
there
is
no
other
deterrence
on
them.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
comment
as
to
why
the
indictment
here
was
delayed?
