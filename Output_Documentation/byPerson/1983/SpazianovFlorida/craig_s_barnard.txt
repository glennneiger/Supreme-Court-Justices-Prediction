mr.
craig
s.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
spaziano
is
before
the
court
for
review
of
a
death
sentence
imposed
by
the
state
of
florida.
the
questions
presented
here
involve
whether
the
procedures
that
were
followed
were
adequate
to
assure
reliability
of
either
the
guilt
determination
or
the
penalty
determination.
despite
the
evidence
and
the
verdict,
mr.
spaziano
may
or
may
not
be
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
this
is
so
because
the
jury
was
not
given
options
in
its
guilt
deliberations.
the
one
option
that
the
jury
did
have,
the
sentencing
verdict
it
did
choose
to
exercise,
and
that
was
overriden
by
a
judge
that
was
not...
the
judge
that
was
not
privy
to
the
guilt
deliberations
of
the
jury.
the
death
sentence
in
this
case
thus
results
from--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--my
point
was
simply
that
the
judge
was
not
a
part
of
the
guilt
deliberations,
and
that--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--that's
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
there
are
dual
constraints
on
the
power
of
the
jury's
decisionmaking
here.
there
were
constraints
in
the
guilt
phase
on
the
jury's
ability
to
evaluate
the
defendant's
culpability
in
any
reasonable
manner.
the
question
here
is
whether,
in
the
guilt
phase,
the
jury
must
be
given
more
than
two
options;
or,
if
not,
must
the
jury...
the
jury's
verdict
for
life
in
the
second
phase
at
least
be
accorded
finality.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
believe
a
new
trial
is
appropriate
under
beck.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence,
i
believe,
would
be
at
least
how
far
the
relief
had
to
go.
the
question
as
to
whether
a
new
trial
is
required
was
not
settled
in
beck,
but
the
logic
of
beck
would
indicate
that
a
new
trial
is
required,
because
the
harm
in
beck
was
the
harm
of
a
distorted
fact
finding
at
a
time
when
the
defendant's
life
was
at
stake.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
but
the
first
issue
is
the
beck
issue.
it
involves
an
application
of
the
court's
decision
in
beck
v.
alabama.
the
court
held
in
beck
that
the
death
sentence,
very
simply,
may
not
be
imposed,
consistent
with
the
constitution,
where
it
is
imposed
after
a
verdict
of
quilt
of
a
capital
offense,
where
the
jury
had
no
other
options
other
than
acquittal.
the
court
reasoned
that
such
a
situation
puts
pressure
on
the
jury,
if
you
will,
that
threatens
the
efficacy
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
that
guilt
determination,
so
much
so
that
in
a
capital
case,
that
risk
can't
be
tolerated;
that
the
risk
of
an
unwarranted
conviction
is
just
too
great.
therefore,
in
beck,
where
the
alabama
legislature
had
passed
a
statute
preventing
the
jury
from
considering
lesser
offenses,
that
procedure
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
similarly,
in
keeble,
where
the
court
was
faced
with
the
prosecution
of
an
indian,
and
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
lower
court
over
lesser
offenses
for
an
indian,
the
court
determined
that
nevertheless
there
was
error.
so
it
is
the
unavailability
of
the--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--i
do
not
know.
the
final
result?
it
was
remanded.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
do
not
know
that.
it
may
have
been...
i
do
know
that
the
court
here
has
since
held
that
it
did
not
decide
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
keeble.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
they
never
got
to
the
point
of
the
request,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run.
the
only
way
that
there
could
have
been
instructions
is
if
there
were
no
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
because
the
situation
would
be
the
same
result
as
beck.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
the
jury
would
be
doing
precisely
what
the
jury
is
doing,
what
it
is
supposed
to
do...
excuse
me.
see,
our
position
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
a
jury
is
the
fact
finder
that
returns
a
verdict
and
tells
us
essentially
what
offense
has
occurred.
and
the
statute
of
limitations,
especially
in
florida,
is
a
separate
legal
decision
that
the
judge
can
make.
it
is
made,
most
of
the
time,
by
a
judge,
not
by
a
jury.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
my
answer
is
that
i
believe
that
it
would
not
mislead
the
jury
to
instruct
on
the
lesser
offenses,
because
if
the
jury
were
instructed
on
the
offense...
the
lesser
offenses...
determined,
as
juries
do,
what
offense
has
been
committed,
and
if
it
was
the
lesser
offense,
it
would
be
doing
precisely
what
a
jury
should
be
doing.
the
judge
would
then
determine
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
there
are
other
options.
if
it
is
believed
that
that
would
mislead
the
jury
too
much,
the
state
has
other
options,
one
of
which
is
to
change
its
statute
of
limitations,
which,
incidentally,
florida
has
since
done.
there
are
a
number
of
options
to
get
around
the
harm
identified
in
beck,
which
is
simply
the
unavailability
to
that
jury
of
the
lesser
offense.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
indict
sooner.
the
state--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--yes.
that
is
absolutely
clear
in
florida
law.
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
and
he
did
not
want
to
waive
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
did
not.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
juries
can
make...
by
their
decisions,
do
speak
to
the
statute
of
limitations
in
some
cases.
it's
a
jurisdictional--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--if,
for
example,
the
statute
of
limitations...
the
offense
was
alleged
to
have
occurred
over
a
period,
before
the
end
of
the
statute
and
the
period
ended
after
the
statute...
what
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury
would
be
just
the
period
that
fell
within
the
statute
as
the
charge
on
the
offense.
it
would
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
that
way,
not
so
much
as
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
as
just
something
that
the
jury--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--the
court
could
determine
it
separately,
yes.
the
jury
is
told
about
time,
but
the
court
can
determine
it.
the
cases
cited
by
the
state
in
their
brief,
in
fact,
are
the
courts
determine
the
factual
questions
regarding
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
not
on
the
record
that
we
have
now.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
but
maybe
the
record...
maybe
there
is
something
that
we
don't
know.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
it
can
be
told
by
certain
things,
none
of
which
are
a
matter
of
record
here,
and
i
don't
want
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
they
are.
i
am
just
saying
that
there
are
a
number
of
determinations
that
could
have
been
made
that
weren't.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
if
there
had
not
been
a
statute
of
limitations
problem,
no,
the
jury
does
not
sentence.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
less
than
capital,
yes,
the
judge
sentences.
i
think
very
clearly
here,
that
the
lack
of
a
third
option
enhanced
that
risk
of
an
unwarranted
conviction
in
this
case.
the
record
is
quite
easily
viewed
as
demonstrating
precisely
what
the
court
predicted
in
beck
did
actually
come
true.
the
jury
had
a
great
deal
of
time
wrestling
with
its
two-option
dilemma.
it
deliberated
it
over
a
number
of
hours
and
there
was
judicial
interruption,
asking
the
jury
if
it
could
reach
a
verdict.
there
finally
was
a
reported
deadlock
and
an
allen
charge,
and
shortly
thereafter
we
had
the
verdict.
only
after
being
dynamited
was
there
a
verdict.
and
then,
in
contrast,
when
it
got
to
the
penalty
trial,
the
jury
rendered
a
very
quick
verdict
for
life
imprisonment.
those,
i
think,
indicate--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--i
cannot
tell
you
the
vote.
it's
not
a
matter
of
our
record,
that
i
know
of.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
it
is--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--that's
correct.
in
this
case,
however,
the
judge
was
going
to
poll
the
jury,
and
then
they
all
decided
not
to,
i
guess,
not
to
embarrass
the
jury.
so
we
might
have
known,
had
they
not
changed
their
minds.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
was
a
majority.
currently,
it's
only
6-6,
the
current
practice
in
florida
is
life.
it
would
take
7
for
death
and
6
for
life
under
the
current
practice,
but
then--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--right.
so
our
position,
very
simply,
is
that
the
evil
of
unreliability
predicted
by
beck
case
true
here.
the
jury
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
fully
evaluating
the
weight
of
the
evidence
in
any
reasonable
manner,
for
precisely
the
reasons
the
court
said
in
beck,
the
pressures
that
this
court
identified
in
beck.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
we
are
making
a
claim,
not
as
to
intent
so
much,
as
to
the
possibility
of
intent.
i--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--i
just
don't
know.
if
the
state
intentionally
waited
until
after
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
think
that
the
argument
would
be
stronger,
but
nevertheless,
i
think
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--could,
but
that's
a
penalty.
that's
a
very
harsh
penalty
for--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--i
think
i
understand
that.
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
know,
however,
that
there
was
only
a
three-week
delay,
and
that
the
state
of
florida
had,
according
to
its
records,
our
record,
had
known
for
a
year
about
dilisio's
allegations
here...
the
complaining
witness...
had
known
for
a
year
about
them,
and
so
we're
left,
i
guess,
with
an
unresolved
record,
but
one
that
certainly
could
be
interpreted
as
indicating
intent.
the
second
issue
presented
is
the
second
issue
or
the
second
prong
of
the
constraints
on
the
jury's
decisionmaking
ability.
the
second
issue
is
a
narrow
issue,
an
issue
that
concerns
a
narrow
aspect
of
the
florida
statute,
the
florida
capital
sentencing
statute.
and
it
is
simply
whether
a
trial
judge
may
disregard
a
jury
sentencing
verdict
after
a
sentencing
trial,
a
verdict
that
is
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
to
answer
that
two
ways.
first
of
all,
florida
didn't
make
such
a
decision.
florida's
decision--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--it
may
be
the
effect
of
it,
but
the
essential
question
that
we're
presenting
is
whether
that's
appropriate
for
the
court,
constitutional
for
the
legislature
to
do.
that
is
the
question
that
we're
presenting.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
under
the
arguments
that
we're
presenting,
yes,
i
would
have
a
problem
with
that
statute.
our
position
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
standards,
as
well
as
those
standards
being
guided
by
the
sixth
amendment,
require
that
there
be
jury's
input.
the
unique
nature
of
the
capital--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--our
position
probably
will
boil
down
to
that,
but
the
question
that
we
have
before
the
court
is
whether,
if
there
is
a
jury,
may
the
judge
overrule
it.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
yes.
under
the
eighth
amendment,
that
is
our
contention.
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
bullington,
that
would
not
be
our
contention.
but
that
involves
different
considerations.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes,
but
i
think
we
need
to
examine
that
a
little.
the
vast
majority
of
states
require
jury
sentencing
in
capital
cases.
there
are
only...
there
are
38
states
currently
with
capital
punishment;
31
of
those
states--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--in
all
crimes?
i
don't
believe
so.
our
focus
is
on
the
unique
nature
of
the
capital
sentencing
decision;
that
capital
sentencing
brings
considerations
that
are
not
controlling
in
non-capital
cases.
non-capital
cases
are
concerned
with
rehabilitation
and
various
aspects
that
the
capital
sentencing
decision
is
not.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
it
is
very
simply
that
a
judge
may
not
impose
a
death
sentence
after
a
jury
has
ruled
in
favor
of
the
defendant
on
that
sentence,
if
the
jury
imposes
life.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that
there
was
no
jury
at
all
involved?
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
sentencing
decision,
under
our
eighth
amendment
analysis
and
sixth
amendment
analysis,
would
have
to
be
by
a
jury.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
we're
arguing,
in
the
alternative,
of
course,
that
bullington
at
the
very
least
says
that
a
judge
could
overrule
a
jury
if
there
is
a
jury
involved.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
under
double
jeopardy
principles,
which
is
at
the
base
of
bullington,
which
that's
the
bullington
decision,
whether
a
jury's
verdict
of
a
life
sentence
must
be
final,
and
that's
what
the
court
held,
and
that's
what
we
are
urging
here.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
yes.
there
are--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--there
are
four
states
currently.
and
our
position,
we
would
think,
would
counsel
that
yes,
a
jury
is
necessary
for
the
capital
sentencing
decision,
at
least
under
the
eighth
amendment.
that
question,
of
course,
is
not
presented.
we
have
not
briefed
it
that
way,
but
i
think
that
that's
the
logical
conclusion.
yes.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
not
with...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
with
a
judge
only
sentencing,
where
a
jury
is
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
three.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no.
there
are
38
total,
31
that
require
a
jury's
consent
for
death.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
have
it
in
our
appendix
here.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
the
number
is
there.
it's
27,
i
think.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
at
bottom,
it's
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
the
death
sentencing
decision.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
i
am
enthusiastic
about
our
argument.
our
argument,
very
simply,
follows
the
methodology
of
the
court,
which
is
the
eighth
amendment
testing
the
contemporary
values.
and
you
can
see,
since
the
mid-19th
century,
the
constant
move
towards
jury
sentencing.
and
then,
looking
now
at
what's
going
on,
it
is
still
jury
sentencing,
and
the
states
did
not
move
away
from
jury
sentencing,
including
florida,
that
had
jury
sentencing
for
100
years,
until
the
court's
decision
in
furman,
suggesting,
as
it
was
suggested
in
woodson
v.
north
carolina,
that
the
states
were
not
reacting
in
any
judgment
about
whether
a
judge
or
a
jury
was
a
better
sentencer,
but
simply
trying
to
retain
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
after
furman.
so
our
decision
or
our
argument
is,
first,
that
the
eighth
amendment,
tested
by
the
evolving
standards,
requires
it
and
that
the
court's
independent
assessment
also
should
counsel
that
way,
because
the
death
decision
is
different.
it
requires
the
conscience
of
the
community.
the
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
that
the
death
penalty
is
an
expression
of
moral
outrage,
that
it
is
retribution
that
is
at
issue,
and
that
can
only
be
set
by
a
jury.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
deterrence
is
relevant
for
a
legislature
when
it
is
deciding
whether
to
pass
a
statute
or
not.
it's
not,
i
don't
believe,
relevant
at
the
sentencing
phase,
selecting
who
is
going
to
die,
because
that
type
of
an
issue
is
directed
towards
other
people,
not
towards
the
uniqueness
of
the
particular
individual
themselves.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
result,
any
more
than
it
would
be
the
result
in
an
acquittal.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
well,
the
analogy
is
to
trial
and
guilt.
a
judge
cannot
overrule
a
jury's
verdict
for
the
defendant,
but
can--
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
--i
don't
think
i
could
argue
that.
i
don't
think
it
is
either
constitutionally
required
that
the
judge
overrule
death,
or
that
it's
constitutionally
prohibited.
i
mean
if
it
were,
there
would
be
a
number
of
states
that
would
be
unconstitutional
either
way.
i
think
florida
can
make
that
choice.
and
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
craig
s.
barnard
very
briefly,
just
to
clear
up
some
facts.
justice
stevens's
question
regarding
overruling
a
death
verdict,
judges
overruling
a
death
verdict...
those
statistics
are
not
kept,
but
there
are
some
indications
in
our
certiorari
petition...
the
petition
itself...
we
had
attached
an
appendix
which
set
out
some
of
those
statistics
from
data
done
by...
collected
by
linda
foley,
professor
foley,
who
has
done
a
study.
that
data
reports...
and
again,
it's
set
out
in
the
certiorari
petition
appendix...
that
where
death
is
involved,
either
the
jury
or
the
judge
is
thinking
about
death,
or
has
decided
on
death,
the
disagreement
is
about
6
percent
the
judge
would
impose
life
or
the
jury
would
impose
death;
in
28
percent,
where
the
jury
would
impose
and
then
the
judge
imposes
death.
so
the
disagreement
is
quite
vast
there.
about
avoiding
detection,
that
is,
of
course,
not
true.
the...
all
that's
required
in
florida
is
that
the
state
file
an
arrest
warrant,
and
that
tolls
the
statute
of
limitations,
so
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
in
this
record
at
all
that
joe
spaziano
was
avoiding
detection.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
require
a
new
trial
under
beck
v.
alabama
or
to
require
the
imposition
of
a
life
sentence
consistent
with
what
the
jury
has
said.
thank
you.
