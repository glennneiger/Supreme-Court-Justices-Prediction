mr.
mark
c.
menser
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
spaziano
has
presented
three
claims
here
today.
the
first,
of
course,
is
the
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
some
relief
from
his
tactical
decision
at
trial
to
send
this
case
to
the
jury
on
an
all-or-nothing
basis.
i
think,
in
addressing
this
issue,
we
have
to
start
right
off
by
discovering
who
did
what
to
whom
here.
and
the
fact
is
that
it
was
mr.
spaziano
who
went
to
the
court,
who
said
to
the
judge,
if
i
did
this
thing,
i
ought
to
be
killed,
and
then
whose
attorney
went
to
the
jury
in
closing
argument,
and
he
said,
look,
folks,
here's
this
man
accused
of
first
degree
murder,
here's
this
man
who's
accusing
him.
and
then
he
said,
in
a
classic
golden
rule
argument,
he
said
would
you
want
your
life
in
the
hands
of
mr.
dilisio,
who
is
a
drug
user
and
a
reprobate,
and
who
knows
what
else?
it
was
a
very
strong
argument.
it
led
to
the
jury
being
out
for
a
great
length
of
time
before
returning
a
guilty
verdict,
but
the
fact
is,
it
was
mr.
spaziano's
strategic
choice
to
hit
the
jury
right
between
the
eyes
with
this
argument.
and,
having
gambled
and
lost,
he
wants
another
roll
of
the
dice
up
here.
and
we
don't
think
it's
fair
to
the
state
of
florida
to
have
constant
retrials
while
defendants
tests
their
alternate
defense
theories.
and
that's
basically
what
they're
asking
for
here.
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
is
not
a
constitutional
defense.
it
is
a
statutory
defense.
it
was
set
up
by
the
state
of
florida,
and
it
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
defendants
in
criminal
cases
to
use
as
they
see
fit.
that's
the
whole
thing.
mr.
spaziano
chose
not
to
use
it.
somebody
else
might
choose
to
use
it.
the
very
fact
that
he
can
use
it
as
a
bargaining
chip
does
not
render
constitutionally
suspect
this
proceeding,
any
more
than
a
waiver
of
speedy
trial
would,
or
a
guilty
plea
would,
where
he
would
waive
his
right
to
jury
trial.
there
is
simply
no
constitutional
problem
here.
mr.
spaziano,
in
fact,
thought
so
little
of
this
argument
that
he
didn't
even
appeal
it
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
what
he
did
was,
he
filed
his
brief,
and
then
when
the
beck
decision
cane
out,
he
sent
it
up
as
supplemental
authority.
so
it
didn't
even
dawn
on
him
that
his
rights
had
been
so
horrendously
violated
until
someone
told
him
about
it.
on
the
jury
override
question,
we
would
submit
right
off
the
bat,
this
is
not
a
jury
override
case.
there
was
a
gardner
remand
here.
the
first
time
this
case
cane
up
for
cert
to
this
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
had
decided
to
remand
the
case
for
resentencing
pursuant
to
gardner,
because
what
had
happened
was,
the
original
trial
jury
was
not
told
that
mr.
spaziano
had
committed
three
other
murders,
four
bombings,
and
then
had
raped
a
girl
in
orlando
and
cut
her
eyes
out
so
she
couldn't
testify
against
him.
and
there
were
some
other
cases
where
his
fellow
members
of
the
outlaws
motorcycle
gang
had
scared
off
the
witnesses.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
yes.
the
trial
judge
was
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
he
could
not
tell
them
about
it.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
no,
because
in
this
particular
case,
the
trial
judge
had
ruled,
at
least
as
to
the--
mr.
mark
c.
menser
--correct.
that
the
issues
could
not
be
presented
to
the
jury
because
he
felt
that
since
the
one
rape
conviction
was
on
appeal,
that--
mr.
mark
c.
menser
--so
he
was
wrong.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
when
i
presented
this
argument,
in
the
context
of
it,
it's
why
there
was
a
gardner
remand,
not
necessarily
what
was
fair.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
situation
where
the
jury
has
rendered,
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
the
worst
possible
decision,
okay,
or
advisory
sentence.
they
have
recommended
life.
that's
the
bottom
line.
that's
the
most
they
could
do.
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
fact
that
that
was
not
the
proceeding
which
led
to
mr.
spaziano
being
sentenced.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
but
that
set
aside
and
remanded,
pursuant
to
gardner.
when
he
was
actually
sentenced,
there
was
no
jury
there.
it
was
a
straight
proceeding
before
the
judge--
mr.
mark
c.
menser
--we
don't
know
that
the
jury...
what
the
jury
would
have
done
in
the
second
sentencing.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
no,
but
i
can
give
the
judge
one,
but
i
won't
hang
two
on
him.
i
think
that
he
overrode
the
jury
one
time.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
well,
no,
we
don't;
because,
quite
frankly,
the
jury
doesn't
sentence
the
man
anyway.
the
question
was
asked,
when
counsel
was
arguing
about
whether
the
florida
statute
has
a
jury
sentencing
or
a
mere
advisory
sentence,
counsel
has
indicated
that
he
thought
it
was
a
sentence.
but
the
statute
is
very
clear,
the
section...
florida
statute
921,
141(b)...
i'm
sorry...
2...
is
titled
advisory
sentence
by
the
jury.
and
proffitt
and
barclay
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
jury
doesn't
sentence
anybody.
this
is
a
straight
sentencing
by
the
judge.
it's
in
compliance
with
the
constitution,
and
we
really
have
no
problem
here.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
well,
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
200
men
on
death
row.
we
have
80
cases
where
the
judge
erred
in
overriding
the
jury
verdict,
and
we
have
120
cases
where
the
judge
blindly
followed
the
jury
and
refused
to
exercise
his
discretion
and
superior
abilities,
okay.
the
argument
just
doesn't
have
any
merit.
the
fact
is
that
florida
is
a
very
unique
state.
mr.
spaziano
may
be
happy
going
with
a
jury
decision
in
orlando
or
seminole
county,
which
is
rather
urban,
but
i
guarantee
you,
if
you
put
him
in
ocoee
or
apalachicola
or
ku
klux
klan
country
somewhere,
he'll
be
thanking
god
every
day
that
there
was
a
judge
there
to
override
the
jury.
so
it's
just
a
specious
argument.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
that,
i
don't
know.
i'm
sorry.
when
the
judge
enters
a
life
sentence,
they
do
not
have
the
automatic
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
when
there
is
a
life
sentence,
it
would
just
go
to
a
district
court
of
appeal
which
would
make
the
final
determination.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
no.
in
fact,
this
court
observed
in
both
proffitt
and
barclay,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
rejected
almost
80
percent
of
the
jury
overrides
where
death
has
been
imposed.
and,
in
cases
where
the
jury
has
recommended
death,
we
don't
know
how
many
times
the
judge
has
given
life.
but
we
have
to
assume
it
happens.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
correct.
that's
the
long
and
the
short
of
it,
unless
the
court
has
any
particular
question.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
well,
we
do
know
that
no
one
who's
received
it
has
ever
broken
the
law
again.
but
the
fact
is
that...
not
to
be
facetious...
but
the
fact
is
there
are
three
prongs,
okay.
there
is
the
fact
that
society
has
to
be
protected.
in
mr.
spaziano's
case,
perhaps
12
murders,
4
bombings,
who
knows
how
many
rapes,
okay.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
no,
because
the
murders
go
on
in
prison,
and
there
is
a
real
and
present
danger
to
prison
guards
and
other
inmates.
the
second
one
is
the
deterrence
factor.
we
do
know
that...
well,
we'll
never
know
how
many
people
don't
commit
murder
because
they
might
get
the
chair.
we
do
know,
again,
that
the
recidivism
rate
for
executed
prisoners
is
zero,
and
that...
and
if
one
life
is
saved
that
way,
that's
fine
with
us.
it's
worth
it.
and
the
third
factor,
of
course,
is
so
miniscule
as
to
be
nonexistent,
but
counsel
refers
to
the
retribution
factor,
which
it's
discussed,
but
i
personally
don't
accept
it.
basically,
it's
the
protection
of
society
and
the
prevention
of
future
murders.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
i
don't...
i
don't
really
see
how.
i
mean
maybe
if
i
was
on
a
jury
and
got
all
worked
up
about
some
guy,
maybe
i
would
want
to
get
even.
but
i
just
can't
make
that
decision
for
someone
else.
it's
there,
i'm
sure,
but
i
just
don't
know
how
important
it
is.
if
i
might
digress,
there
was
an
article
recently...
there
was
a
column
by
jim
kilpatrick,
regarding
the
fact
that
the
federal
system
does
not
have
a
death
penalty,
and
how
two
prisoners
here
in
washington,
d.c.
were
trying
to
get
into
the
aryan
brotherhood,
and
to
get
in
they
had
to
kill
somebody.
and
all
that
could
happen
to
them...
they
killed
two
prison
guards
in
the
space
of
an
hour...
and
all
the
federal
government
could
do
was
return
them
to
their
cell,
because
they
were
already
under
a
life
sentence.
this
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
we
look
at
it
in
terms
of
protecting
society,
including
the
society
within
the
prison
walls.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
that
could
be.
if
we
have
someone
who
managed
to
get
himself
a
life
sentence
and
then
kept
on
going,
yes.
mr.
mark
c.
menser
your
honor,
the
bodies
were
discovered
by
some
strangers
in
1975.
there
are
actually
two
bodies
that
were
discovered,
but
only
one
that
they
could
piece
together.
mr.
spaziano's
modus
operandi
was
to
dismember
his
victims
while
they
were
still
alive,
and
then
scatter
the
parts.
they
could
not
find
any
evidence
directly
linking
mr.
spaziano
to
the
crime.
the
prosecution
did
not
commence
from
the
record,
only
because
they
did
not
have
enough
information
to
get
an
indictment
or
information
until
the
time
they
finally
did.
they
had
mr.
dilisio's
ramblings
in
the
jail,
but
i
would
agree
with
the
defense;
he
was
not
the
most
reliable
individual
in
the
world.
i
wouldn't
go
and
put
someone
in
jail
on
a
first
degree
murder
charge,
just
based
on
something
he
said,
without
getting
some
corroboration.
it
was
not
our
fault
that
mr.
spaziano
avoided
arrest
for
two
years,
and
he
shouldn't
benefit
from
it.
now,
under
the
old...
this
case
came
up
under
florida's
old
limitations
statute.
under
the
new
statute,
the
limitations
problem
would
not
exist,
because
when
a
defendant
avoids
arrest,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
told.
but,
unfortunately,
this
was
under
our
old
statute
where,
if
you
just
hid
out
for
two
years,
you
could
get
away
with
murder.
that's
all
i
have.
