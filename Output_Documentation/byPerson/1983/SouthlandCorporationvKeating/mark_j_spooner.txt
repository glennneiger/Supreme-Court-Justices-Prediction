mr.
mark
j.
spooner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
important
issues
of
interpretation
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
a
preliminary
question
regarding
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case
has
also
been
raised,
and
i
will
address
that
point
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
on
the
merits
the
two
issues
are
first
whether
the
states
are
free
to
enact
statutory
exceptions
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
thereby
striking
down
arbitration
agreements
that
would
otherwise
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable
under
the
specific
terms
of
section
2
of
the
federal
statute.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
states
are
free
to
engraft
their
judicial
class
action
procedures
onto
private
arbitrations
involving
interstate
commerce
being
conducted
pursuant
to
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
issues
in
this
case
arose
in
the
following
way:
the
plaintiff
appellees
are
former
franchisees
of
7-eleven
convenient
stores
in
the
state
of
california.
they
alleged
that
their
franchisor,
the
southland
corporation,
violated
the
terms
of
the
franchise
agreement
with
respect
to
certain
of
its
bookkeeping
procedures
and
also
that
it
did
not
fully
disclose
to
them
at
the
time
they
became
franchisees
the
types
of
procedures
that
it
would
use
in
preparing
financial
statements
for
their
stores.
they
claimed
that
southland's
actions
and
inactions
constituted
a
breach
of
contract,
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty,
a
common
law
fraud,
and
a
violation
of
the
state's
franchise
investment
law
which
requires
franchisors
to
make
certain
types
of
disclosures
to
their
respective
franchisees.
these
cases
were
filed
in
court
notwithstanding
a
broad
forum
arbitration
clause
in
the
franchise
agreement,
and
the
plaintiffs
have
resisted
arbitration.
this
effort
has
been
successful
so
far
because
they
have
convinced
the
california
supreme
court
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
state's
franchise
invesment
law
to
require
franchisees
to
arbitrate
claims
that
they
base
on
that
statute.
they
have
also
convinced
the
california
supreme
court
with
respect
to
the
clearly
arbitrable
claims,
the
common
law,
breach
of
contract
and
fraud
claims,
to
remand
the
cases
not
to
an
arbitrator
but
back
to
the
trial
court
so
that
the
court
can
conduct
class
certification
proceedings
and
thereafter
to
supervise
any
arbitration
which
is
held
to
be
appropriate
for
class-wide
adjudication.
we
have
brought
this
case
here
under
section
1257
of
the
judicial
code.
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
jurisdiction
is
lacking
because
the
decision
below
allegedly
does
not
constitute
a
final
judgment.
they
base
this
argument
on
the
fact
that
the
california
supreme
court
contemplates
that
extensive
judicial
proceedings
are
yet
to
come
in
the
trial
court.
i
submit
if
it
may
please
the
court
that
that
is
precisely
the
point
that
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate
this
case
in
a
nonjudicial
forum
and
that
is
where
we
ought
to
be.
the
evil,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
is
precisely
that
it
is
compelling
extensive
judicial
proceedings
to
occur
in
the
trial
court.
under
the
practical
tests
that
this
court
uses
to
determine
finality
we
think
that
the
decision
is
clearly
final
because
it
decides
important
issues
under
a
federal
statute
in
a
definitive
way.
these
issues
are
collateral
to
the
merits
of
the
case
and
in
addition
the
decision
is
final
in
the
sense
that
if
this
court
reverses
the
decision
of
the
court
below
the
judicial
proceedings
clearly
will
be
at
an
end.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
your
honor,
it
was
raised
below.
we
stated
the
issue
in
the
california
supreme
court
as
follows:
whether
a
court
may
enter
an
order
compelling
the
private
commercial
arbitration
governed
by
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
to
proceed
as
a
class
action.
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
strenuously
in
their
brief
in
this
court
that
we
did
not
litigate
this
issue
as
a
federal
question,
but
i
submit
that
that
claim
is
a
red
herring.
what
happened
was
that
the
parties
all
stipulated
in
the
court
below
that
this
case
involved
interstate
commerce
and
thus
the
federal
act
applied.
our
argument
was
that
arbitration
and
class
actions
were
fundamentally
incompatible
with
one
another
and,
therefore,
if
you
superimposed
class
action
procedures
which
would
necessarily
involve
extensive
judicial
involvement
onto
a
private
arbitration
you
would
in
essence
be
destroying
the
arbitration
proceeding
as
the
nonjudicial
procedure
it
was
itended
to
be.
we
also--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--it
did
not
intend
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
govern
procedures
in
state
court
relating
to
arbitration.
for
example,--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--yes,
in
the
sense
that
the
state
courts
are
required
to
enforce
the
federal
arbitration
act
just
as
the
federal
courts
are.
this
court
in
the
moses
cohen
hopsital
case
last
term
specifically
held
that.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
it
did,
your
honor.
it
came
from
a
federal
court,
but--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--well,
your
honor,
i
stand
corrected.
the
court
did
state
several
points
in
its
opinion
and
i
may...
it
may
not
have
been
the
holding
of
the
decision,
but
the
court
emphasized
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
establishes
a
substantive
right
in
favor
of
arbitration
and
that
this
substantive
right
prevails
over
any
state
substantive
or
procedural
policies
to
the
contrary.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
turning
to
the
first
of
the
issues
presented
here
on
the
merits,
the
question
is
whether
the
states
are
free
to
enact
statutory
exceptance
to
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
believe
that
the
court
was
clearly
incorrect
in
so
holding.
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
specifically
designed
to
overrule
state
policies
and
legislation
which
would
do
precisely
what
the
california
statute
does
in
this
case.
section
2--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
the
evidence
is
clearly
against
us.
the
procedural
protections
in
many
of
the
sections
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
speak
to
what
the
united
states
courts
should
do
if
proceedings
relating
to
arbitration
are
brought
in
the
united
states
courts.
however,
section
2
of
the
federal
statute
specifically
says
without
limiting
the
protection
of
the
statute
to
any
particular
courts
that
arbitration
agreements
involving
maritime
trade
or
interstate
commerce
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable
save
on
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
what
congress
did
in
this
section
was
to
broadly
declare
that
these
contracts
shall
be
upheld
and
they
shall
be
enforced
except
on
grounds
that
apply
to
any
contract
such
as
waiver
or
duress
in
a
particular
case.
but
if
a
contract
satisfies
those
general
doctrines
of
contract
formation,
section
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
that
that
contract
must
be
enforced.
i
think
also
that
if
section
2
were
read
otherwise
very
unfortunate
results
would
occur
because
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
in
interstate
commerce
would
depend
on
the
forum
in
which
enforcement
was
sought.
that
would
lead
to
forum
shopping
and
would
destroy
the
predictability
in
interstate
commercial
dealings
that
is
so
important.
section
2
does
not
say
that
arbitration
agreements
in
interstate
commerce
shall
be
enforceable
unless
the
states
provide
otherwise,
and
we
do
not
think
it
can
logically
be
read
in
that
fashion.
if
it
were,
states
could
undermine
the
entire
policy
of
the
act
merely
by
creating
a
cause
of
action
in
which
they
say
that
you
cannot
arbitrate
this
claim.
i
think
this
case
presents
a
pretty
good
example
of
precisely
that
problem.
the
plaintiffs'
claim
in
this
case
is
essentially
a
breach
of
contract
and
a
fraud
claim.
they
say
that
their
franchisor
mislead
them
and
failed
to
disclose
material
facts.
the
common
law
fraud
claim
is
clearly
arbitrable
and
the
statutory
claim
is
indistinguishable
in
terms
of
its
elements,
in
terms
of
its
basic
nature
from
the
common
law
claim.
yet
what
the
appellees
are
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
if
the
legislature
of
california
chooses
to
say
that
you
cannot
arbitrate
this
kind
of
claim
then
what
would
otherwise
be
valid
and
enforceable
under
the
federal
statute
ceases
to
become
so.
the
plaintiffs'
argument
on
this
issue
really
boils
down
to
stating
that
congress
has
occasionally
adopted
exceptions
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
when
it
has
passed
various
types
of
federal
legislation
so
why
should
the
states
not
be
free
to
do
so.
well
the
answer
to
that
is
simply
that
the
supremacy
clause
applies
to
the
states
and
it
does
not
control
what
congress
can
do.
what
congress
gives
it
can
take
away,
but
the
states
cannot
take
away
what
congress
has
made
valid
and
enforceable
in
a
federal
statute.
there
are
obvious
policy
differences
as
well
between
exceptions
to
a
protective
federal
statute
like
this
where
the
exceptions
are
created
by
congress
and
the
states.
congress
when
it
is
considering
adopting
an
exception
can
carefully
balance
the
different
considerations
and
can
keep
the
scope
of
the
exceptions
within
very
narrow
limits,
but
when
each
of
50
individual
states
are
permitted
to
adopt
exceptions
the
scope
of
those
exceptions
will
become
virtually
uncontrolled.
the
other
important
difference
from
a
policy
point
of
view
is
that
any
exceptions
adopted
by
congress
will
apply
uniformly
throughout
the
united
states
and
parties
that
enter
into
arbitration
agreements
will
be
able
to
predict
whether
those
agreements
are
going
to
be
enforced
or
not
with
respect
to
particular
kinds
of
claims.
but
if
each
state
can
decide
for
itself
when
these
agreements
are
going
to
be
enforced
and
when
they
are
not
that
predictability
would
be
lost.
the
plaintiffs'
position
in
this
case
or
rather
i
should
say
the
california
legislation
in
this
case
as
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court
reflects
we
think
a
basic
mistrust
for
arbitration.
the
underlying
notion
of
their
argument
seems
to
be
that
arbitration
is
somehow
going
to
be
a
vehicle
that
is
going
to
allow
the
party
with
the
superior
resources
to
defeat
small
claims.
i
think
that
that
basic
premise
is
one
that
has
to
be
challenged,
that
arbitration
is
beneficial
for
everybody
but
particularly
beneficial
when
small
claims
and
people
with
limited
resources
are
involved.
the
party
with
the
superior
resources
can
often
litigate
cases
to
death,
can
take
full
advantage
of
discovery
rules,
string
out
the
case
forever
and
frustrate
small
claims.
but
if
a
party
is
free
to
bring
a
case
in
arbitration
he
can
get
it
tried
promptly.
he
can
devote
the
resources
to
it
that
it
deserves,
and
he
can
prevent
the
liberal
discovery
rules
and
the
backlog
of
the
courts
from
frustrating
getting
a
resolution
of
his
claim.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
well,
it
is
a
question
of
whether
that
legislation
would
be
within
the
proper
scope
of
congress'
power
to
legislate
in
interstate
commerce,
and
if
it
were
a
constitutional
exercise
of
its
power
certainly
it
would
overrule
any
contrary
legislation
enacted
by
the
individual
states.
with
regard
to
the
federal
arbitration
act,
i
think
that
this
court
held
in
the
prima
paint
case
that
the
statute
clearly
is
a
proper
exercise
of
congress'
power
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
interstate
commerce.
if
i
may
turn
to
the
second
issue
which
is
presented
here
for
review,
the
class
action
issue,
what
the
court
held
was
that
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
trial
court
even
with
respect
to
claims
that
are
clearly
subject
to
arbitration,
the
nonfranchise
investment
law
claims,
so
that
the
court
could
conduct
class
certification
proceedings.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
the
decision
on
both
issues
is
final,
justice
stevens,
and
with
respect
to
this
one
in
particular
we
think
that
it
is
final
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
a
specific
california
statute,
section
1294
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
specifically
states
that
if
a
petition
to
compel
arbitration
is
denied
the
party
has
to
take
its
appeal
immediately.
so
southland
took
its
appeal
at
the
juncture
in
this
case
when
it
was
compelled
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
california
law.
secondly,
the
plaintiffs'
argument
is
that
a
class
has
not
been
certified
yet
in
this
case
and
that
southland
may
be
able
to
convince
the
trial
court
not
to
certify
a
class
and,
therefore,
we
do
not
have
a
final
judgment.
what
this
misses,
i
think,
is
that
the
issue
here
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
even
if
at
the
end
of
judicial
class
certification
proceedings
southland
were
able
to
defeat
the
class,
it
would
have
been
required
to
go
through
many
months
of
very
highly
judicial
proceedings
which
would
be
enmeshed
with
the
underlying
merits
of
the
case.
this
court
has
stressed
that
class
certification
issues
requried
a
very
careful
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
the
claims
that
are
involved
in
the
case
and
the
type
of
evidence
that
would
be
presented
at
a
trial.
therefore,
what
inevitably
happens
in
these
cases
is
that
the
parties
take
detailed
discovery
to
explore
that
issue.
they
brief
the
issue
extensively
to
the
court.
the
court
often
holds
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
issue,
and
this
court
has
held
that
evidentiary
hearings
may
be
required
in
some
instances.
then
a
decision
is
rendered.
now
even
if
at
the
end
of
this
many
months
of
proceedings
southland
were
able
to
defeat
the
class,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
california
court
here
opens
up
a
judicial
procedure
which
is
in
direct
contradiction
of
the
policy
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
which
as
this
court
said
in
the
moses
cohen
case
is
to
move
people
out
of
court
and
into
arbitration
as
quickly
and
easily
as
possible.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
would
be
free
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
arbitration
at
all
with
respect
to
claims.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
that
is
the
implication
of
what
they
would
do,
but
our
position
on
the
merits
is
that
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
that.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
that
because
the
federal
statute
creates
a
right
of
the
parties
to
have
their
arbitration
agreement
enforced
and
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
court
to
decide
in
a
particular
case
that
some
other
procedure
would
be
more
efficient.
therefore--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--if
the
contract
provided
for
a
class-wide
arbitration,
then
the
issue
would
be
could
it
do
so
without
violating
principles
of
due
process
of
law.
there
is
no
issue
here
in
that
regard
because
the
contract
does
not
say
anything
about
class
action
proceedings,
and
i
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
rendered
a
decision
which
assumes
that
the
contract
does
not
provide
for
such
arbitration.
the
thrust
of
its
decision
is
that
regardless
of
whether
the
parties
agree
to
it
or
not
this
can
be
imposed
on
the
parties.
speaking
very
briefly
about
the
merits
of
this
class
action
issue,
our
position
is
simply
that
the
two
procedures,
class
actions
and
arbitrations,
are
fundamentally
incompatible
with
one
another.
the
whole
idea
of
arbitration
is
to
establish
a
procedure
which
is
simple
and
quick
and
inexpensive
and
informal
and
most
of
all
nonjudicial
whereas
class
actions
by
their
very
nature
as
well
as
by
due
process
considerations
are
necessarily
very
formalized
in
their
procedures,
very
time
consuming,
very
expensive
and
most
of
all
highly
regulated
by
the
courts.
if
a
court
did
not
actively
supervise
every
stage
of
this
proceeding
and
guarantee
that
the
named
representative
is
adequately
represented
the
class,
if
the
court
did
not
ensure
that
the
evidence
being
presented
in
trial
were
truly
common
to
all
class
members
the
results
of
that
arbitration
would
not
be
binding
on
absent
class
members.
so
if
a
court
tries
to
create
a
hybrid
of
the
two
procedures
you
would
have
to
have
a
court
looking
over
the
arbitrator's
shoulders
every
step
of
the
way
and
you
would
be
creating
endless
opportunities
for
one
part
or
the
other
to
go
running
back
to
court
asking
a
judge
to
second-guess
what
the
arbitrator
has
done.
we
think
that
this
court
has
to
make
a
choice.
you
can
either
tell
parties--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--your
honor,
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
cannot...
a
judge
unless
he
is
involved
in
a
class
action
case
and
if
he
is
just
looking
at
it
after
the
fact
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
know
what
kind
of
job
the
class
represents.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
the
court
specifically
said
that
in
addition
to
the
class
certification
proceedings
the
court
would
have
to
exercise
a
measure
of
control
over
the
arbitration
itself
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
interests
of
the
class
were
being
adequately
represented
as
well
as
to
approve
any
settlements
or
dismissals.
they
did
not
define
what
that
measure
of
supervision
and
control
would
be,
but
our
position
is
that
it
would
necessarily
be
quite
extensive
and
regardless
of
whether
it
was
extensive
or
not
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
idea
that
arbitration
is
supposed
to
be
a
procedure
apart
from
the
court
systems
taking
place
outside
of
that
forum.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
that
we
would
oppose
it?
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
the
client
would
oppose
it,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
primary
attributes
of
arbitration
is
that
when
somebody
raises
a
claim
you
can
litigate
it
simply
and
informally.
if
we
had
a
class-wise
arbitration
proceeding
you
would
have
two
things
that
would
change
the
ballgame
altogether.
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
procedures
and
the
complexities
of
such
a
procedure
would
be
such
that
the
case
would
become
more
complicated
than
if
it
has
remained
in
court
all
along.
secondly,
there
would
be
severe
questions
about
whether
if
southland
won
in
such
a
procedure
the
results
would
be
binding
on
absent
class
members.
third,
one
of
the
attributes--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--what
i
am
saying
is
we
would
not...
i
interpreted
your
question
to
say
would
we
think
it
was
a
good
idea
to
have
such
a
procedure
and--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--it
is
not
as
simple
as
that
because
when
a
franchise
is
sold
the
disclosure
document
is
only
the
first
step.
you
sit
down
with
every
person
and
you
explain
it
to
them.
you
have
face-to-face
meetings.
they
have
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
other
franchisees.
you
cannot--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--we
should
certainly
resist
the
notion
of
a
class-wide
arbitration
both
on
the
traditional
grounds
on
which
class
actions
are
opposed
plus
on
the
broader
grounds
that
i
have
outlined.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
well,
the
first
question
would
be
whether
that
employment
agreement
involved
interstate
commerce.
if
it
did
not
then
the
federal
arbitration
act--
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
--the
second
question
would
be
whether
a
provision
in
section
1
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
exempt
this
class
of
case
from
the
scope
of
the
federal
statute.
section
1
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
applicable
to
the
contracts
of
workers
engaged
in
seamen's
contracts
and
other
interstate
transactions.
the
scope
of
that
exemption
for
workers
claims
has
never
been
construed
by
this
court.
it
might
be
construed
not
to
apply
to
that
situation.
mr.
mark
j.
spooner
if
it
was
not
exempt
and
if
the
contract
satisfied
the
general
doctrines
of
contract
formation,
it
was
not
forced
upon
them
by
undue
means
then
our
position
would
be
that
the
federal
act
controls
and
the
agreement
should
be
enforced.
the
plaintiffs
argue
here
that
there
are
federal
situations
in
which
certain
types
of
claims
have
been
held
not
to
be
appropriate
for
arbitration
and
they
try
to
suggest
that
there
is
some
sort
of
a
broad
exemption
for
statutory
claims.
that
simply
is
not
the
case.
this
court
has
held
in
only
a
very
few
situations
that
particular
federal
claims
are
not
suited
for
arbitration,
and
it
has
done
that
only
after
carefully
analyzing
congressional
intent
in
the
particular
statute
involved.
thank
you,
your
honor.
