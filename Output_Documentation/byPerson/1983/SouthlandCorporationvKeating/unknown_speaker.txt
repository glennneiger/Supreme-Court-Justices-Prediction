unknown
speaker
the
class
arbitration
issue
was
certainly
not
clearly
raised
below
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spooner,
do
you
think
that
congress
intended
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
govern
procedings
in
state
courts?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
intended
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
apply
to
state
courts
at
all?
unknown
speaker
did
it
hold
that?
i
thought
moses
cohen
came
from
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
a
holding
was
something
that
was
necessary
to
the
disposition
of
a
case.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
dicta,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well
is
the
evidence
of
the
congressional
intent
not
somewhat
indicative
that
it
only
intended
it
to
imply
in
federal
courts?
the
problem
came
i
suppose
with
erie
v.
thompkins
and
all
of
that,
but
the
evidence
of
what
congress
intended
is
pretty
clearly
against
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
spooner,
what
if
the
california
legislature
had
felt
very
strongly
contrary
perhaps
perversely
contrary
to
the
way
you
are
now
speaking
and
felt
that
arbitration
was
just
simply
a
trap
for
the
unwary
and,
therefore,
it
said
that
no
contractual
undertaking
in
this
state
providing
for
arbitration
shall
be
enforced.
do
you
think
that
is
just
all
down
the
well,
so
to
speak,
after
the
federal
arbitration
act?
unknown
speaker
what
if
congress
adopted
a
statute
called
the
federal
confession
of
judgment
statute
providing
that
there
should
be
confessions
of
judgment
permissible
in
all
proceedings
in
federal
or
state
courts
and
lots
of
states
i
guess
have
a
policy
against
confessions
of
judgment
because
they
regard
them
as
pretty
one-sided.
no
problem
about
enforcing
that
if
congress
said
so?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spooner,
may
i
interrupt
you
here?
you
started
out
to
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
jurisdiction
and
the
final
judgment
question,
but
i
really
did
not
understand
your
argument
on
why
this
portion
of
the
judgment
is
final.
you
are
just
starting
out
about
all
the
proceedings
that
are
going
to
take
place
on
remand.
i
think
maybe
you
ought
to
be
sure
you
have
covered
everything
you
want
to
say
on
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
still
true
that
the
alternatives
on
remand
are
several
really
as
i
understand?
one
is
that
they
may
allow
the
arbitration
to
go
forward
under
some
kind
of
judicial
supervision
with
sort
of
a
semi-class
action.
another
is
there
would
be
no
arbitration
at
all.
another
is
there
would
be
an
old-fashioned
class
action.
i
am
not
sure
the
issues
are
as
clear
cut
as
you
seem
to
describe
them.
i
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
happen
when
this
case
goes
back
on
this
issue.
is
that
not
the
very
reason
we
tend
to
postpone
review
because
we
are
trying
to
know
exactly
what
we
are
called
upon
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood
it
if
you
do
not
consent
to
a
class-type
arbitration
then
they
could
decline
to
arbitrate
at
all
under
the
california
supreme
court's
opinion
or
did
i
misread
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
the
trial
court
to
construe
the
contract
as
authorizing
some
kind
of
a
joint
arbitration
with
three
or
four
different
franchisees?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schooner,
why
under
california
procedure
would
the
california
courts
not
be
free
to
say
the
arbitrator
can
conduct
a
class
proceeding
as
he
wants
to.
we
will
only
check
it
out
when
you
bring
an
action
to
enforce
the
arbitration
award
so
that
you
would
not
have
any
interim
supervision
of
the
arbitration
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that
may
make
good
sense
as
a
matter
of
legal
observation,
but
can
you
tell
from
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
they
adopted
your
proposition?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spooner,
may
i
ask
another
question?
it
really
again
relates
a
little
bit
to
the
finality,
but
do
we
know
that
on
remand
if
the
issues
are
a
little
more
clearly
defined
than
they
seem
to
be
now,
say,
for
example,
that
you
get
an
arbitration
of
whether
there
was
adequate
disclosure
and
presumably
you
have
got
some
form
documents
you
give
every
franchisee.
do
we
know
it
will
be
contrary
to
your
client's
interest
to
have
a
single
arbitration
resolving
that
issue
for
everybody
who
says
you
did
not
make
an
adequate
disclosure?
that
seems
to
me
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
that
you
would
oppose
the
class.
unknown
speaker
yes--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
clearly
will
not
be
binding
if
you
do
not
have
a
class-wide
arbitration.
you
are
foreclosing
the
opportunity
to
get
a
class-wide
binding
adjudication
by
resisting
the
class
action.
unknown
speaker
you
say,
for
example,
one
of
the
issues
is
whether
the
disclosure
is
adequate.
if
you
give
them
some
form
book
that
says
how
you
are
going
to
do
your
accounting
or
something
i
presume
you
give
everybody
the
same
book,
and
the
arbitratory
will
look
it
over
and
say
it
either
is
or
is
not
an
adequate
disclosure
and
that
would
end
it.
maybe
i
oversimplify
the
thing.
unknown
speaker
to
the
extent
that
it
depends
on
oral
negotiations
obviously
you
could
not
have
a
class-wide
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
interferes
with
the
rights
of
individual
parties
to
pick
their
own
forum
by
contract?
unknown
speaker
in
a
case
strictly
in
the
federal
courts,
berman
v.
zepotowich
neither
of
you
cite,
this
court
discussed
that
subject
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
parties
dealing
at
arms
length
could
make
binding
contracts
for
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
you
say
the
superior
court
found
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
i
have
great
problem
with
your
constant
argument
about
you
cannot
waive
rights.
i
do
not
know
of
any
rights
you
cannot
waive.
unknown
speaker
you
can
waive
federally
protected
constitutional
rights.
you
can
waive
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
the
arbitral
statements
can
do
it,
but
i
think
you
are
saying
that
they
just
cannot
waive
them
at
all.
unknown
speaker
mr.
well,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
must
confess
i
am
not
sure
i
thoroughly
understand
this
argument.
i
know
it
runs
through
the
california
supreme
court
opinion.
would
it
really
be
a
different
case
if
california
said
we
really
do
not
like
arbitrations
at
all
but
we
understand
we
have
a
duty
to
honor
contracts
under
the
federal
statute
but
we
do
not
have
to
honor
this
one
because
of
our
own
franchise
invesment
law?
would
that
make
the
issue
any
different?
you
seem
to
rely
heavily
on
the
fact
that
california
generally
has
a
policy
similar
to
the
federal
policy.
unknown
speaker
would
it
matter
if
they
had
a
policy
hostile
to
the
federal
policy?
unknown
speaker
supposing
they
had
a
statute
that
said
we
do
not
want
to
arbitrate
anything
more
than
the
federal
government
requires
us
to,
and
we
do
not
think
they
require
us
in
all
events
to
arbitrate
this
particular
class
of
claims.
unknown
speaker
then
i
do
not
see
the
force
of
their
argument
that
their
general
policy
is
very
similar
to
the
federal
policy.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
no
more
because
we
really
do
not
like
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
a
similar
question
a
different
way.
supposing
they
had
ruled
that
contracts
of
adhesion
are
something
we
do
not
like
in
california,
therefore,
we
will
never
enforce
an
arbitration
clause
in
a
contract
of
adhesion.
i
think
have
argued
something
close
to
that.
unknown
speaker
could
they
have
accepted
that
argument
consistently
with
the
federal
arbitration
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
spooner,
before
you
begin
supposing
that
southland
in
this
case
instead
of
dealing
with
franchisees
had
been
dealing
with
new
employees
and
had
handed
to
each
one
when
they
came
to
work
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
any
claim
of
injury
arising
out
of
or
in
the
course
of
their
employment
and
then
one
of
them
sustained
an
injury
and
went
to
the
industrial
accident
commission
in
california
and
southland
pleaded
you
have
to
arbitrate
this
and
the
california
court
said
no
we
just
do
not
allow
anything
except
industrial
accident
commission
proceedings
for
industrial
injury.
do
you
think
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
require
arbitration
to
prevail
there?
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume
that
it
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
assume
that
was
not
exempt.
