mr.
john
f.
wells
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
discussing
the
problem
that
mr.
schooner
discussed
first,
namely,
the
question
raised
by
the
claim
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
preempts
any
claims
litigated
under
the
franchise,
that
is,
preempts
the
anti-waiver
clause
in
the
california
franchise
investment
law.
but
before
addressing
the
question
of
preemption
there
is
a
preliminary
issue
that
needs
to
be
resolved
and
needs
to
be
addressed
by
this
court,
and
that
is
whether
the
arbitration
clause
in
question
in
fact
and
in
law
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
claims
under
the
california
franchise
investment
law.
the
preliminary
question
was
decided
in
the
trial
court
in
this
case
against
arbitration.
he
concluded
that
the
clause
in
question
was
not
intended
to
and
did
not
reach
claims
under
the
statute.
the
district
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
him,
and
reversed
that
part
of
his
decision.
that
decision
was
set
aside
by
the
supreme
court's
grant
of
a
hearing
so
that
decision
was
vacated.
the
california
supreme
court
expressly
declined
to
discuss
that
issue
because
it
passed
straight
to
the
preemption
issue
and
held
that
the
franchise
investment
law
claims
are
not
arbitrable
under
the
anti-waiver
clause
in
the
franchise
investment
law,
a
clause
copied
from
the
federal
securities.
it
interpreted
that
clause
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
did
in
wilko
v.
swan
and
concluded
that
the
california
legislature
intended
to
provide
a
special
judicial
forum
for
claims
under
that
act
just
as
in
the
securities
law
and
then
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
not
inconsistent
therewith
because
congress
had
announced
or
enacted
similar
policies
to
the
franchise
investment
law
in
securities
cases
and
others.
mr.
john
f.
wells
to
the
extent
only
that
the
california
supreme
court...
excuse
me.
the
california
legislation
as
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court
has
decided
that
a
certain
class
of
citizens
need
protection
from
their
own
waiver
for
arbitration
agreement
because
the
statute
provides
that
parties
may
not
waive
their
rights
under
this
statute.
to
that
extent,
yes,
parties
are
foreclosed
from
entering
into
binding
arbitration
agreements
as
they
might
relate
to
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law.
mr.
john
f.
wells
that
is
right,
of
course.
that
is,
of
course,
the
thrust
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
is
the
thrust
of
the
california
arbitration
act,
and
i
think
most
states
have
similar
statutes
which
overrule
the
old
common
law
rule
that
agreements
to
arbitrate
are
not
enforceable
because
they
house
the
courts
of
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
as
exemplified
in
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
policy
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
california
as
exemplified
by
its
arbitration
statute
is
that
generally
speaking
agreements
to
arbitrate
future
disputes
are
valid
and
enforceable
except
on
grounds
that
might
invalidate
contracts
generally.
congress
and
the
state
legislature
in
fact
the
legislatures
i
am
told
by
the
amicus
briefs
some
38
states
have
enacted
legislation
in
the
securities
field
which
the
franchise
investment
law
is
very
analogous
to
which
include
that
same
provision
that
persons
who
bring
claims
under
these
remedial
statutes
are
not
obliged
to
arbitrate
those
claims.
they
are
guaranteed
their
day
in
court,
a
judicial
forum.
that
is
the
policy
of
the
congress,
and
that
is
the
policy
of
the
state
legislatures.
more
than
that
the
congress
has
specifically
encouraged
the
states
to
pass
parallel
and
concurrent
securities
regulations
statutes.
the
securities
act
specifically
provides
for
concurrent
jurisdiction
on
issues
of
securities
violations
by
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
of
course
the
extent
that
congress
and
the
securities
exchange
commission
have
occupied
the
field,
any
legislation
to
the
contrary
by
a
state
would
be
invalid.
but
these
state
statutes
are
essentially
the
same
as
the
federal
statutes
in
purpose
and
in
effect,
and
quite
apart
from
encouraging
forum
shopping
the
conclusion
if
the
supreme
court
of
california's
decision
is
upheld,
the
decision
that
southland
is
asking
for
is
the
one
that
would
encourage
forum
shopping
because
as
i
understand
their
position
it
is
that
while
congress
may
have
a
policy
and
may
include
anti-waiver
provisions
in
its
securities
statute
in
order
to
protect
the
person
who
is
in
the
weaker
bargaining
position
and
ensure
him
his
day
in
court,
the
state
legislatures
who
are
encouraged
to
pass
these
concurrent
and
overlapping
securities
statutes
are
not
entitled
to
pursue
that
same
policy.
that
would
result
in
the
same
claim
that
came
into
the
federal
court
being
not
arbitrable
but
if
it
was
brought
in
the
state
court
under
the
state
securities
law
it
would
be
required
to
be
arbitrated.
back
to
the
question
of
the
preliminary
inquiry
which
i
think
this
court
must
address
before
it
reaches,
shall
we
say,
the
merits
of
the
preemption
claim.
the
clause
in
question...
the
supreme
court
of
california
specifically
declined
to
rule
on
that
issue,
but
it
is
an
issue
that
was
in
the
case.
it
was
always
contended
by
us
that
this
clause
does
not
include
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law
for
this
reason,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
valid
reason.
the
arbitrator
has
only
the
power
that
is
given
him
by
the
arbitration
agreement.
he
is
not
a
court.
he
can
only
do
what
the
parties
have
agreed
that
he
may
do,
and
in
this
case
although
the
preamble
section
or
the
introductory
section
of
this
clause
says
that
he
may
arbitrate
all
issues
which
arise
out
of
or
relate
to
the
agreement
while
you
might
say
that
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law
because
they
have
a
relationship
to
the
agreement
it
goes
on
and
gives
him
the
authority
only
to
award
damages
for
breach
of
the
agreement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
arbitration
agreement
which
gives
him
any
authority
to
award
damages
for
misrepresentations
leading
up
to
the
agreement
that
are
required
by
the
franchise
investment
law,
and
that
is
a
respect
in
which
this
arbitrator
could
not
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
franchise
investment
law.
mr.
john
f.
wells
that
is
right.
the
superior
court,
the
judge
in
superior
court
said,
"i
find
that
this
clause
is
not
broad
enough
to
include
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law.
"
he
said,
"i
also
think
that
if
it
did
those
claims
would
not
be
arbitrable
for
the
reasons
that
were
later
adopted
by
the
supreme
court.
"
but
he
clearly
indicated
as
one
of
his
grounds
for
that
ruling
that
he
thought
the
agreement
would
not
reach
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law.
furthermore,
another
clause
in
another
part
of
the
arbitration
clause
provides
that
nothing
herein
shall
authorize
the
arbitrator
to
vary
or
modify
or
supplement
any
of
the
terms
of
this
contract.
now
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
remedies
under
the
franchise
investment
law
one
of
which
is
that
if
the
disclosure
statement
is
misleading
or
false,
the
required
disclosure
statement,
the
prefranchise
disclosure
statement,
the
court
may
rescind.
one
of
the
remedies
is
rescission
of
the
franchise
agreement.
that
is
a
remedy
that
the
arbitrator
would
not
be
able
to
enforce.
so
the
result
would
be
that
the
plaintiffs
here
would
be
giving
up
more
than
and
they
would
be
waiving
more
than
their
right
to
a
judicial
forum.
they
would
be
waiving
substantive
claims,
rights
that
have
been
given
them
by
the
legislature
under
this
statute.
that,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
federal
courts
including
this
court
have
decided
in
a
line
of
cases
that
there
are
certain
types
of
claims,
remedial
statutes
which
were
intended
to
protect
persons
in
a
weaker
bargaining
position
such
as
the
securities
laws
that
those
claims
are
not
required
to
be
arbitrated
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
arbitrators
are
peculiarly
not
well
suited.
arbitration
is
not
a
good
place
to
enforce
important
rights
set
forward
in
a
statute
that
is
complicated.
it
parts
from
the
common
law.
it
gives
the
parties
benefits
that
they
would
not
have
at
common
law.
it
provides
certain--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--well,
i
think
you--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--well,
i
know
that
the--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--according
to
the
provision
in
the
corporate
securities
act
of
the
state
of
california
as
interpreted
by
the
california
supreme
court,
one
may
not
waive
the
right
to
a
judicial
forum
as
a
place
to
make
a
claim
under
that
statute.
that
same
clause
was
so
interpreted
by
this
court
in
wilko
v.
swan
when
that
clause
was
found
in
the
securities
act
of
1933.
i
thought
that
there
was
no
issue
left
as
to
whether
that
was
not
an
appropriate
decision
that
parties
may
not
waive
by
means
of
an
arbitration
agreement
executed
prior
to
the
event
prior
to
the
dispute
arising
the
right
to
a
judicial
forum.
there
is...
leaving
the
matter
of
the
preliminary
inquiry
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
question
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
which
we
may
do
that
the
arbitration
clause
did
not
reach
these
claims
under
the
franchise
investment
law,
now
the
question
becomes
in
light
of
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
that
such
claims
are
not
arbitrable
is
that
somehow
preempted
by
the
federal
arbitration
act?
that
is
a
question
really
of
whether
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
federal
law
and
policy
and
the
state
law
and
policy.
our
position
on
that
is
that
there
is
no
such
conflict.
each
has
the
same
proarbitration
policy
as
represented
by
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
state
courts
are
every
bit
as
zealous
in
protecting,
that
is
the
california
courts
at
least,
are
every
bit
as
zealous
in
protecting
the
rights
to
arbitrate
under
a
pre-dispute
arbitration
agreements
as
are
the
federal
courts.
the
behavior
of
the
courts
in
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that
because
we
attacked
the
arbitration
agreement
when
it
was
asserted
as
a
basis
for
preventing
or
going
forward
with
a
class
action
on
grounds
that
southland
had
waived
their
rights
under
the
statute
and
on
evidence
which
was
very
strong
in
some
of
these
cases
of
waiver
because
southland
had
gone
ahead
and
litigated
the
case
in
the
courts
and
taken
depositions
for
weeks
and
months
in
certain
of
the
cases.
the
california
courts
nevertheless
held
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
right
to
arbitrate.
when
presented
with
the
adhesion
contract
argument
in
this
case,
the
california
court
leaned
over
backwards
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
although
finding
that
this
arbitration
clause
was
in
an
adhesion
contract,
the
california
supreme
court
nevertheless
refused
to
say
that
it
was
invalid
and
unenforceable
unless
perhaps
it
would
be
so
if
it
had
the
effect
of
defeating
the
effect,
the
right
to
a
class
remedy.
by
the
same
token
both
jurisdictions,
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
have
the
same
policy
the
same
set
of
laws
in
the
field
of
securities
regulation,
franchise
regulation
and
others
that
recognize
that
in
certain
situations
where
you
are
dealing
with
important
statutory
rights
whether
it
be
under
the
securities
laws,
anti-trust
laws,
fair
labor
standards
act,
bankruptcy
laws
notwithstanding
the
strong
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
these
are
claims
that
are
not
suited
to
arbitration.
arbitration
is
not
appropriate,
and
it
is
not
the
federal
policy
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
require
arbitration
in
those
cases.
so
there
is
no
conflict
really
between
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
and
the
policy
of
the
state
government,
and
nothing
about
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
here
is
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
or
in
conflict
with
the
policy
of
the
federal
government.
if
this
case
had
come
up
under
the
federal
securities
act
rather
than
the
california
franchise
investment
law,
that
very
same
anti-waiver
clause
would
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
under
the
doctrine
of
wilko
v.
swan.
there
is
no
reason--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--yes,
i
do.
mr.
john
f.
wells
if
they
had
a
statute
that
reenacted
the
common
law,
if
they
repealed
the
california
arbitration
act
and
said--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--that
would
be
the
same
case
we
have
here
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
wells
maybe
i
did
not
understand
the
question,
justice
stevens.
i
thought
you
said
if
the
california
statute
said
we
will
enforce
those
arbitration
agreements
the
federal
arbitration
act
requires
us
to
enforce.
mr.
john
f.
wells
i
do
not
think
that
the
california
courts'
policy
with
respect
to
arbitrating
disputes
that
are
not
in
congress
would
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case
so
long
as
the
claim
before
the
court
at
that
time
was
a
claim
under
the
franchise
investment
law
which
is
directly
analogous
to,
in
fact
it
derives
from
the
federal
policy
in
the
securities
regulation
field
because
they
copied
the
anti-waiver
clause
right
from
that--
mr.
john
f.
wells
--that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
wells
yes,
i
think
they
could
because
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
that
all
agreements
to
arbitrate
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable
save
on
grounds
for
the
revocation
of
contracts
generally
at
law
or
in
equity.
to
us
as
we
understand
that
it
means
that
if
the
ground
for
refusing
to
enforce
the
arbitration
agreement
is
a
ground
applicable
to
contracts
generally
and
as
a
part
of
a
general
contract
law
then
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
reach
that.
it
does
not
require
that
agreement
to
be
enforced.
so
there
are
various
situations
under
general
contract
law,
and
i
think
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
would
apply
to
that.
there
is
a
whole
area
here
where
if
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
going
to
be
given
the
effect
of
federal
law,
substantive
law
but
recognizing
that
it
includes
many
procedural
aspects
as
does
the
state
statute
then
there
is
going
to
be
a
question
do
we
apply
the
federal
law
to
this
particular
issue
that
goes
to
the
arbitrability
of
the
contract
or
do
we
apply
the
state
law.
those
are
very
nice
questions.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
for
this
case
to
observe
that
the
effect
of
these
federal
decisions
exempting
certain
types
of
claims
from
the
operation
of
the
arbitration
statute
is
to
define
the
scope
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
the
scope
of
that
act
is
to
reach
out
and
require
arbitration
when
people
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
most
of
the
time
but
not
always.
there
is
a
certain
class
of
cases
where
it
does
not
apply.
those
cases
have
been
described
by
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
from
time
to
time.
they
are
the
bankruptcy
cases
and
the
anti-trust
cases
and
the
securities
regulation
cases
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases.
those
are
a
class
of
cases
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
apply
to,
and
in
our
view
the
only
rational
interpretation
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
when
applied
to
state
law
claims
is
that
if
they
are
in
that
same
category
of
claims
if
they
are
directly
analogous
to
those
claims
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
reach
on
the
federal
side
the
federal
arbitration
act
should
not
then
reach
them
on
the
state
side.
that
is
buttressed.
it
seems
to
me
it
becomes
a
kind
of
a
fortiori
case
where
you
are
dealing
with
the
very
sensitive
duality
federal
state
problem
here
because
here
you
have
a
state
legislature
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
enacting
a
remedial
statute
for
the
benefit
of
its
citizens
which
will
apply
to
some
extent
in
cases
in
interstate
commerce.
that
will
be
necessarily
the
case
because
everything
has
some
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
adopt
a
policy
which
is
identical
to
that
of
the
congress.
in
the
area
of
selecting
the
forum
for
the
adjudication
of
state
created
rights
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
recent
case
of
northern
pipeline
against
marathon
the
power
of
congress
is
very
minimal.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
anything
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
reach
not
as
far
and
would
stop
short.
we
are
dealing
with
state
legislatures
who
have
declared
in
this
particular
situation
our
citizens
are
entitled
to
a
judicial
forum
where
that
was
true
on
the
federal
side.
but
in
any
case
we
have
a
case
that
is
exactly
analogous
to
wildo
v.
swan
and
these
other
federal
cases.
finally,
there
is
the
matter
if
i
may
now
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
case,
that
is,
the
set
of
issues
that
come
here
under
the
common
law
claims
assuming
now
for
the
sake
of
argument
again
that
some
claims
are
going
to
be
arbitrated
in
this
case
whether
they
be
claims
under
the
federal
franchise
investment
law
or
the
common
law
claims.
now
the
question
that
southland
raises
is
since
the
arbitration
agreement
in
question
is
covered
by
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
this
notion
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
there
can
be
a
class-wide
arbitration
something
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
very
nature
of
an
arbitration
as
a
method
for
dispute
resolution
that
it
must
violate
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
since
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
preempt
any
state
policy
to
the
contrary.
now
on
that
issue
i
have
several
things
to
say
about
that,
but
the
most
important
thing
is
that
issue
does
not
belong
here.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
raises
any
significant
federal
question.
it
was
an
issue
that
was
never
raised.
the
preemption
argument
on
the
issue
of
class-wide
arbitration
was
never
raised
by
southland
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california.
to
be
sure
it
was
recognized
by
both
sides
that
the
federal
arbitration
act,
at
least
the
substantive
provisions
thereof,
would
cover
the
question
of
arbitrability,
that
is,
that
it
applied
to
this
contract
since
it
affected
commerce.
our
position
was
then
and
it
is
now
and
has
always
been
that
it
really
does
not
make
any
difference
on
the
substantive
side
whether
the
federal
arbitration
act
or
the
state
arbitration
act
applied
because
we
find
no
difference
between
them.
we
have
found
no
case
or
statement
of
policy
interpreting
the
california
arbitration
act
that
is
any
different
from
the
statements
and
interpretations
of
this
or
the
other
federal
courts
in
interpreting
the
federal
arbitration
act.
it
is
very
clear
that
state
courts
apply
their
own
procedures
in
enforcing
the
arbitration
act.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
you
look
to
the
california
court
of
civil
procedure
to
determine
how
to
go
about
filing
a
motion
to
compel
arbitration
or
to
obtain
a
judgment
on
the
basis
of
an
arbitration
award.
there
are
various
things
in
both
of
these
statutes
that
are
appropriate
in
the
procedures
of
that
court.
here
in
the
state
court
you
do
not
apply
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
nor
if
you
are
in
the
federal
court
visa
versa.
but
the
question
of...
so
the
only
extent
to
which
southland
ever
referred
to
or
treated
this
as
a
federal
question
in
the
california
courts
was
to
recognize
that
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
they
claimed
that
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
you
could
have
a
class
arbitration
they
represented
to
the
california
courts
that
that
was
a
question
to
be
decided
under
state
law
and
that
since
there
was
no
authority
for
it
in
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
that
it
should
not
be
done.
we
responded
to
the
same
question
by
the
district
court
of
appeals
as
to
which
law
applied
by
saying
that
it
did
not
matter.
we
could
find
no
difference
between
the
two.
we
assumed
that
california
law
would
apply
and
argued
by
analogy
that
the
fderal
rules
of
civil
procedure
would
provide
some
guidance
to
the
california
courts
in
developing
a
class
remedy
just
as
the
california
courts
have
looked
to
rule
23
of
idd
federal
rules
in
developing
the
class
remedy
generally
in
court
actions.
so
first
and
foremost
it
was
never
raised.
it
is
not
discussed.
the
issue
of
preemption,
the
contention
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
preempts
this
and
prevents
the
supreme
cout
of
the
state
of
california
from
remanding
this
case
to
the
trial
court
to
consider
the
desirability
of
a
hybrid
kind
of
class
arbitration
was
never
raised
as
a
federal
issue
as
a
constitutional
question
below--
but
even
if
it
were
not
only
is
there
no
final
judgment
there
is
not
any
judgment
of
any
kind
except
the
remand
to
the
trial
court
to
consider
the
alternative
ways
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
we
have
conflicting
policies
that
the
california
courts
recognize
as
important,
the
importance
of
preserving
the
parties'
rights
to
arbitration
if
they
have
agreed
to
arbitrate
and
the
importance
of
providing
a
class
remedy
for
persons
in
the
position
of
these
franchisees
when
dealing
with
their
franchisor,
a
large
corporation
like
southland.
it
is
a
kind
of
situation
that
is
perfect
for
the
class
remedy.
if
there
can
be
no
class
remedy
then
one
of
two
things
will
happen.
either
there
will
be
a
large
number
of
individual
arbitrations
or
as
southland
hopes
there
will
be
a
handful
of
arbitrations
because
other
people
do
not
know
they
have
a
claim.
but
the
class
remedy...
the
california
supreme
court
said
in
that
situation
if
the
effect
of
the
arbitration
clause
is
going
to
be
to
defeat
the
class
remedy
then
perhaps
the
arbitration
clause
under
general
principles
of
contract
law
as
we
understand
them
should
be
declared
invalid
because
of
the
principles
applicable
to
adhesion
contracts.
so
it
sent
the
entire
thing
back
to
the
trial
court
who
had
not
considered
any
of
these
issues
to
decide
among
the
alternatives.
shall
there
be
consolidation
of
arbitrations
which
is
clearly
recognized
by
the
federal
rules
and
the
california
court
says
would
also
be
available
under
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure?
should
there
be
a
single
arbitration
or
some
class
arbitration
under
court
supervision?
that
is
a
possibility.
possibly
the
arbitration
clause
should
be
stricken
or
it
should
be
voided
because
of
the
principles
applicable
to
adhesion
contracts.
a
hearing
will
have
to
be
held.
evidence
will
have
to
be
taken.
a
trial
judge
will
have
to
consider
what
to
do.
in
that
posture
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
not
be
wise
for
this
court
to
try
to
deal
with
the
constitutional
claim
that
somehow
objectives
or
policies
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
have
been
interfered
with
and
the
preemption
doctrine
should
apply.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
will
conclude
my
presentation.
