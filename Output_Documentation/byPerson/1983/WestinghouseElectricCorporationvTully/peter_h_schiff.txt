mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
view
of
the
case
that
mr.
dodyk
has
argued
is
very
different
from
what
i
understand
the
case
to
be
and
what
the
facts
to
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
a
good
part
of
what
mr.
dodyk
has
argued
are
the
issues
on
which
you
relate
to
the
second
issue
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
with
respect
to
which
you
dismissed
it
for
being
insubstantial.
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
law
of
the
case
that
the...
new
york
was
perfectly
proper
in
viewing
westinghouse
and
the
westinghouse
disc
on
a
unitary
basis.
nevertheless,
a
good
part
of
the
argument
that
i've
heard
just
now
and
in
their
briefs
seems
to
challenge
the
application
of
the
unitary
principle.
admittedly,
it
is
done
by
the
back
door
in
relation
to
the
credit,
but
it
seems
to
underlie
the
claim
that
somehow
new
york
is
taxing
out-of-state
income
or
is...
because
they
claim
that
we
are...
about
the
credit,
that
the
measurement
of
the
credit
is
wrong
because
we
base
it
on
disc
income
related
to
shipments
from
a
place
of
business
in
new
york,
but
that
we
don't
give
it
credit
if
the
shipments
are
from
a
place
outside
new
york,
assumes
that
we
are
somehow
taxing
income
that
is
outside
the
state.
now,
what
new
york
has
done
here
in
applying
the
three-factor
business
allocation
formula
which
this
court
so
recently
reaffirmed
in
the
container
case,
was
to
only
tax
new
york
income.
now,
once
it's
determined
what
the
overall
amount
of
new
york
income
is,
we
submit
that
it
was
reasonable
for
new
york
to
apply
a
credit
only
to
that
portion
of
the
accumulated
disc
income,
and
that's
the
disc
income
for
which
the
federal
government
provides
a
tax
break,
is
to
try
to
ascertain
what
of
the
total
amount
of
disc
income
is
reasonably
attributable
to
new
york.
because
in
the
first
place
in
applying
the
business
allocation
formula,
as
our
court
of
appeals
has
said,
new
york
is
only
taxing
new
york
income.
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
strange
policy
indeed,
whether
the
commerce
clause
or
any
other
provision
of
the
constitution,
to
say
that
we
have
to
give
a
credit
on
income
that
we
have
never
taxed
in
the
first
place.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
the...
the
credit
is
only--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
no,
no.
the
credit
applies...
well,
it
might
if
everything
is
from
new
york
and
if
all
the
disc
income
is--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
that's--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
the
objective--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--i
think
probably
so.
the
objective--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--the
objective
of
the
credit
is
to
some
degree
track
the
credit
that's
being
given
by
the
federal
government,
but
that--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
we
give
it
a
lesser
rate,
but
i
don't
see
what's
peculiar
about
that.
i
mean
we
can
only...
we
would
only--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--but
we're
only
taxing
income
in
the
state
in
the
first
place,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
and
the
question
then
is
do
we
have
to
tax
the
disc
income
at
the
same
rate
as
all
other
new
york
income,
and
that's
all
that
the
division
here
involves.
other
business
income
which...
that's
related
to
new
york
which
isn't
disc
income
we
rate...
we
tax
at
the
9
percent
level.
if
it
is
disc
income
or
if
we
have
an
investment
tax
credit
or
some
other
credit,
it
is
a
somewhat
lesser
rate.
now,
let
me
also
point
out
that
the
credit
here...
mr.
dodyk
keeps
talking
about
we
tax
it
at
2.7
percent.
if
he
had
used
the
figures
in
the
record
as
applied
to
westinghouse
rather
than
deriving
hypothetical
examples
throughout
his
brief,
the
effective
tax
rate
on
the
accumulated
disc
income
which
is
derivable
from
the
record
in
1972,
one
of
the
years
in
question
here,
was
approximately
8.69
percent;
in
1973
it
was
about
8.65
percent...
the
fact
reflected
by
the
actual
size
of
the
credit
here.
the
size
of
the
credit
in
1975
that
they
are
objecting
to
and
apparently
they
want
to
pay
more
is
about
$2,500.
in
1973
it
was
about
$6,000,
even
though
westinghouse
was
paying
an
overall
corporate
income
tax
in
new
york
of
about
a
million
dollars
for
the
two
years
combined.
and
i
suggest
in
response
to
a
question
that
justice
rehnquist
asked
that
the...
that
if
westinghouse
were
to
win
in
this
case,
that
it
would
be,
in
terms
of
the
questions
that
have
been
left
open
by
this
court,
an
invalidation
of
a
disc
credit
in
its
entirety
with
the
result
that
yes,
indeed,
mr.
dodyk
would
be
shooting
himself
in
the
foot
because
his
client
would
be
paying
about
$10,000
more
for
the
two
years
here
in
question.
whether
he
could
then
change
the
new
york
legislature's
way
of
determining
the
credit
i
do
not
know,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
legislative
question.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
disc
credit
is
invalid
or
not
and
not
how
it
was
computed.
they
did
not
preserve
any
arguments,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
in
this
court
or
even
in
the
court
below.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
or
at
least
to
not
lose
any
more
business
than
necessary.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
in
terms
of
the
goods
that
are
shipped,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--it's
a
question
of
really
of
where...
i
would
say
it's
a
question
of
where
westinghouse
does
it
business,
because
the
question
isn't
really
where
it
is
shipped.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
are...
obviously,
the
purpose
of
the
credit.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no.
i
think
i'm
trying--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
it
may
affect
commerce.
i
think
any
credit
does.
and
the
differentiation
between
state
taxes
in
one
state
and
another
always
is
liable
to
affect
commerce.
new
york,
unfortunately,
is
a
state
which
has
some
of
the
highest
taxes
in
the
country,
and
recognizing
that
the--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
i
think
they
affect
everybody
the
same.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
oh,
yes,
it
does.
it
does.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
everybody
who
is
doing
business--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--no,
not
to
new
york.
you
don't
pay
it
to
new
york,
because
you're
not
paying
any
taxes
on
what
is
being
shipped
from
new
jersey.
that
would
be
an
incident
of
the
new
jersey
taxation,
not
an
incident
of
new
york
taxation.
now,
this
is...
could
i--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--we're
applying
the
unitary
principle
just
the
way
it's
been
applied
regularly.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
justice
white,
if--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--no,
no.
not--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--i
mean
i
think...
i
think
that
the--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
if
i
understood
what
you
were
just
saying,
when
you
apply
the
apportionment
principle,
of
course,
in
some
sense,
as
mr.
dodyk
points
out
in
his
reply
brief,
if
the
5
percent
business
allocation
formula
is
applied,
you
could
say
your
taxing
some
new
jersey
income,
some
california
income.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
but
that's...
that's
not
the
point.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
all
of
its
disc
income
and
all
of
its--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--if
the...
there
had
been
a
place
of
business...
that
is,
a
manufacturing
company
or
a
warehouse
that
westinghouse
was...
through
which
it
was
generating
its
income,
if
that
is
where
the
exports
are
coming
from,
yes.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
but
it's
not
a
question
of
where
the
port
of
embarkation
is.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
if
all
the
incidents
were
in
new
york,
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
is
likely
that
there
would
be
more
income
to
new
york.
there
would
also
be
more
cost.
new
york
might
or
might
not
make
more
or
less
tax.
and
one
of
the
problems
we
have
with
westinghouse's
presentation
is
they
have
made
absolutely
no
factual
showing
on
this
record.
they've
been
purely
hypothetical.
now,
i
think
the
teaching
of
this
court--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--absolutely.
it's
totally--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
the
hope
is...
well,
if
they
do
some
new
york
export--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--of
course.
if
they
do
some
new
york
export
business,
if
they
are
generating
some
of
their
income
from
new
york
business,
and
that's
being
exported...
because
that's
the
only
thing
that
the
disc
credit
relates
to...
we
will
then
apply
a
lower
tax
rate
to
that
income,
which
we
think
is
totally
consistent
with
this
court's
language
in
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
and
other
cases
like
the
bowers
case
which
permit
states
to
give
credit
to
try
to
compete.
now,
there
is
a
major
difference
between
our
tax
and
the
credit
in
this
case
and
the
boston
stock
case
and
the
maryland
against
louisiana
case.
in
those
cases...
in
the
boston
case
it
was
clear
that
new
york
was...
while
it
was...
it
was
attempting
to
tax
extraterritorially,
i
think.
we
are
imposing
a
tax
on
the
stock
transfer,
but
we
oppose
the
full
tax,
but
it
varied
depending
on
whether
the
transfer
was
being
accomplished
through
an
out-of-state
stock
exchange
or
a...
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
there
was,
however,
enough
incidents
to
tax
it
in
new
york
because
the
transfer
of
the
stock
certificate,
i
think,
was
happening
there,
so
that
we
were
discriminating
depending
on
where
part
of
the
transaction
happened.
in
this
case
the
only
thing
that
we
tax
in
applying
the
unitary
principle
is
new
york
income,
and
then
we
only
apply
credit
to
the
new
york
income.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
a
very,
very
conservative
credit
because
we
use
these
two
percentages,
which
means
that
the
credit
boils
down
to
something
like
a
quarter
of
one
percent.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
no,
it
doesn't,
except
that
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
commerce,
the
degree
of
it
is
also
relevant.
it's
not
done
in
pure
abstract
terms,
your
honor.
it
is
done
in
practical
terms.
but
in
any
event,
we
are
not
taxing
extraterritorially,
and
the
same
thing
was
true
in
maryland
against
lousiana.
there,
louisiana--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--in
which
case?
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think...
i
think...
well,
i
have
to--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
but
i...
i,
with
all
due
respect,
i
do
not
see
how
we
get
to
discrimination
in
this
case
if
we
are
not
taxing,
as
they
suggest,
extraterritorial
values
in
the
first
place,
or
giving
a
credit
extraterritorially.
the
statement
made
is
that
we
should
not
be
giving
a
credit
to
new
york
disc
income
because
we
are
taxing...
would
be
taxing
out-of-state
disc
income
at
a
higher
level.
now,
that
seems
to
me
to
assume
that
we
are
taxing
something
out
of
state
in
the
first
place,
and
we
are
definitely
not
doing
that.
i
must
admit,
and
this
may
be
my
problem,
i
have
had
difficulty
in
understanding
what
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
because
from
our
perspective
the
formula
applied
after...
to
the
total
income
means
that
we
are
only
taxing
new
york
income.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it's
the
three
factor
business
allocation
formula,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
it's
treated
as
if
the...
it's
really
combined,
i
guess,
but
it's
the
westinghouse
electric
and
westinghouse
disc
are
treated
as
being
unitary.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
we
include
everything,
all
the
income
and
all
of
the
property,
receipts
and
payroll
of
those
companies.
what
westinghouse
would
have
us
do
is
to
go
behind
the
companies
that
are
being
treated
in
the
combined
income,
which
is
something
that
is
not
done
in
application
of
the
business
allocation
formula.
now,
we
do,
if
westinghouse
claims
that
by
not
going
behind
it
there
is
something
unfair
in
the
application
of
the
business
allocation
formula,
which
is,
i
think,
truly
what
they
are
arguing
here.
new
york
tax
laws,
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
would
have
permitted
them
to
try
to
show
some
unfairness
as
it
relates
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
they
haven't
made
any
effort
to
do
that.
they--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--that
is
exactly
our
position.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
that
is
exactly
our
position.
you
said
it
much
better
than
i.
but
that
is
our...
our
position
in
a
nutshell.
and--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
--well,
in
terms
of
the
original
allocation,
the
only
formula
that's
used
to
determine
what
income
is
taxable
is
the
business
allocation
formula,
and
then
in
determining
the
disc
credit,
we
multiply
it
by
both
fractions.
it's
a
very
conservative
way
of
doing
it,
but
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
figure
it
out
is
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that,
a)
we're
only
taxing
new
york
income,
and
that
we're
only
applying
the
credit
to
new
york
income;
and
b)
that
the
income
with
respect
to
which
we
give
a
credit
is
only
disc
income
as
opposed
to
income
generated
from
other
sources.
now,
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
net
result
is
a
very
small
credit.
i
think
we
could
have
given
a
larger
credit.
and
i
think
that's
what
westinghouse
wants,
but
frankly,
that
doesn't
amount
to
any
constitutional
infirmity.
but
that's
exactly
what
we
do,
justice
o'connor.
i
did
want
to
distinguish
the
maryland-louisiana
case
because
there,
too,
louisiana
was
taxing
extraterritorially
and
giving
a
credit
solely
to
louisiana
so
that
the
tax
really
wasn't
being
paid
in
louisiana
but
was
paid
on
the
same
gas
every
place
else.
but
there
was
no
question
that
there
was
an
extraterritorial
tax
which
could
only
be
done
if
it
was
in
a
nondiscriminatory
fashion.
here,
as
i
have
said,
there
is
no
extraterritorial
tax.
the
credit
is...
i
think
the
concept
of
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
as
well
as
its
application.
for
these
reasons
i
ask
for
an
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
