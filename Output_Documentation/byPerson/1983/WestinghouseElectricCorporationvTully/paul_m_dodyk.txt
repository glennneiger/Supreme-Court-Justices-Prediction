mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
appeal,
westinghouse
electric
corporation
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
the
way
in
which
the
state
of
new
york
taxes
the
income
of
a
domestic
international
sales
corporation
or
disc.
a
disc
is
not
a
typical
business
corporation.
it
is
a
vehicle
established
under
the
internal
revenue
code
to
permit
the
deferral
of
income
taxes
with
respect
to
certain
income
from
exports.
the
income
which
may
be
attributed
to
a
disc
and
on
which
tax
may
be
deferred
is
determined
by
a
formula
set
forth
in
the
internal
revenue
code
such
as
50
percent
of
net
income
or
4
percent
of
gross
receipts
derived
from
exports.
discs
typically
perform
no
functions,
own
no
property,
have
no
employees.
a
disc
is
essentially
an
accounting
segregation
of
a
portion
of
a
taxpayer's
export-related
income
for
purposes
of
tax
deferral.
the
export-related
income
so
segregated
is
essentially
pure
income
separated
from
the
costs
which
generate
that
income.
those
costs
remain
on
the
books
of
the
business
entities
whose
exports
are
in
question.
under
the
internal
revenue
code
as
it
was
in
effect
during
the
relevant
period,
a
taxpayer
was
essentially
permitted
to
defer
federal
taxes
on
50
percent
of
income
allocated
to
the
disc
until
that
income
is
distributed
to
the
parent.
turning
to
westinghouse,
westinghouse
and
its
affiliates
are
engaged
in
a
variety
of
businesses,
some
of
which
exports
products,
a
portion
of
the
income
from
which
during
the
relevant
period
was
allocated
by
westinghouse
to
the
disc.
during
the
years
here
in
question,
1972
and
1973,
approximately
75
to
80
percent
of
the
westinghouse
disc
income
was
derived
from
westinghouse
exports,
approximately
20
to
25
percent
from
affiliates
of
westinghouse.
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
the
affiliates
of
westinghouse
did
no
business
in
new
york.
it
further
establishes
that
the
affiliates
are
autonomous,
independently
managed,
and
deal
with
westinghouse
on
an
arm's
length
basis.
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
treat
these
affiliates
as
unitary
with
westinghouse
and
has
not
attempted
to
tax
their
income
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
they
do
not
do
business
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
tax
practices
here
at
issue
arise
from
new
york's
taxation
of
accumulated
disc
income.
the
particular
tax
involved
is
the
new
york
corporate
income
tax.
the
new
york
corporate
income
tax
is
a
formula
apportioned
tax.
in
determining
the
amount
of
income
which
the
state
of
new
york
taxes,
it
first
attempts
to
determine
the
taxpayer's
total
income.
it
then
multiplies
it
by
a
fraction
which
is
determined
by
the
relationship
of
the
taxpayer's
new
york
property,
payroll
and
revenue
to
the
total
payroll,
property
and
revenue
of
the
taxpayer.
in
determining
the
amount
of
a
taxpayer's
income
to
be
apportioned
to
new
york,
the
state
in
this
case
added
to
the
income
of
westinghouse
the
total
income
of
its
disc,
including
the
amount
on
which
federal
taxes
were
deferred,
and
including
the
amount
derived
by
reason
of
exports
by
westinghouse
non-new
york
affiliates.
having
determined
the
income
apportioned
to
new
york,
the
state
then
applied
a
tax
rate
of
9
percent
to
that
income
as
allocated
to
the
state
of
new
york.
in
computing
the
tax
actually
due,
however,
the
court
took
another
step,
and
that
is,
it
permitted
a
credit
with
respect
to
70
percent
of
the
tax
due
on
accumulated
disc
income.
and
it
is
that
credit
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
because
the
state
of
new
york,
although
it
permits
that
credit,
it
permits
it
only
with
respect
to
exports
which
are
shipped
from
a
regular
place
of
business
in
the
state
of
new
york.
more
specifically,
in
calculating
the
credit,
the
new
york
statute
requires
the
taxpayer
to
multiply
its
accumulated
disc
income
by
a
fraction
of
which
the
numerator
is
gross
receipts
shipped
from
new
york,
and
the
denominator
gross
receipts
from
exports
shipped
from
all
sources.
in
this
case
the
result
was
to
limit
the
credit
permitted
westinghouse
to
approximately
5
percent
of
the
accumulated
disc
income
which
new
york
taxed.
of
course,
with
respect
to
other
corporations
which
have
their
base
of
operations
in
new
york,
such
as
general
electric,
the
credit
is
much
greater.
the
basic
result
of
new
york's
limitation
on
the
availability
of
the
credit
is
that
if
a
firm
ships
exports
from
new
york,
it
will
pay
a
tax
of
2.7
percent
on
accumulated
disc
income
attributed
to
that
shipment,
but
if
it
ships
that
export
from
new
jersey
or
any
state
other
than
new
york,
it
will
pay
a
tax
of
9
percent.
but
in
terms
of
dollars,
if
you
assume
a
corporation
with
$100
million
of
accumulated
disc
income,
50
percent
of
which
is
apportioned
to
the
state
of
new
york,
that
taxpayer
will
pay
to
the
state
of
new
york
a
tax
in
the
amount
$4,500,000
if
it
ships
from
non-new
york
facilities,
but
if
it
ships
from
new
york
facilities,
its
tax
bill
will
only
be
$1,350,000.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
well,
i
guess
in
that
case
my
client,
westinghouse,
would
be
a
very
altruistic
enforcer
of
constitutional
principle.
or
some
would
have
said
i
would
have
succeeded
in
shooting
myself
in
the
foot.
but
in
any
event,
that's
something
for
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
to
determine.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
yes,
of
course.
our
argument
is
essentially
a
simple
one,
and
that
is,
that
any
tax
scheme
which
works
that
difference,
which
imposes
a
higher
rate
of
tax
on
shipments
which
are
made
outside
the
taxing
state
than
it
does
on
the
same
equivalent
shipment
made
inside
the
state
of
new
york
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
commerce
clause
because
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce.
in
this
particular
case
we
believe
that
the
operation
of
the
credit
and
its
unconstitutionality
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
the
state
of
new
york
requires
the
taxpayer
to
add
to
its
income
base
the
entire
amount
of
disc
income,
but
excludes
from
the
denominator
of
the
apportionment
formula
the
property,
payroll
and
revenue
of
the
non-new
york
affiliates
whose
shipments
accounted
for
20
to
25
percent
of
the
disc
income
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
in
a
sense
that
is
true.
and
much
the
same
was
the
case,
of
course,
in
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
where
the
court
observed,
i
guess
for
the
first
time,
that
even
if
one
is
dealing
with
a
discrimination
between
two
forms
of
interstate
commerce,
that
is
still
a
form
of
discrimination
which
the
commerce
clause
proscribes.
essentially,
we
believe
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
and
maryland
v.
louisiana.
in
boston
stock
exchange,
new
york
imposed
a
tax
on
any
transfer
of
securities
which
had
certain
defined
connections
or
contacts
with
the
state
of
new
york.
that
tax
scheme,
however,
included
a
deduction
or
i
should
say
a
credit
and
a
limitation
which
was
applicable
if
the
transfer
was
executed
on
a
new
york
stock
exchange,
so
that
the
effect
was
that
a
transfer
which
was
executed
on
the
boston
stock
exchange
or
some
other
stock
exchange
would
bear
a
higher
rate
of
tax
than
a
transfer
which
was
executed
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
and
we
submit
that
this
case
is
no
different.
in
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
if
you
executed
that
transfer,
you
paid
a
higher
rate
of
tax
if
that
transfer
was
executed
in
boston
as
opposed
to
new
york,
so
here,
if
you
ship
the
export
from
the
port
of
boston,
you
pay
a
higher
rate
of
tax
than
you
do
if
you
ship
that
export
from
new
york.
similarly,
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
the
state
of
louisiana
imposed
a
tax
on
the
first
use
of
natural
gas
coming
into
the
state
from
wells
located
on
the
federal
offshore
properties,
and
it
then
built
into
the
tax
scheme
a
series
of
limitations
in
deductions
which
effectively
limited
the
incidence
of
that
tax
to
gas
which
was
shipped
out
of
louisiana
to
out-of-state
users,
and
this
court
held
that
set
of
limitations
to
work
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
although
obviously
appellees
do
not
accept
our
characterization
of
their
tax
as
discriminatory,
they
do
not
deny,
they
have
never
denied
and
cannot
deny
that
the
effect
of
that
tax,
economic
effect,
is
to
impose
a
higher
rate
of
tax
if
an
export
is
shipped
from
a
non-new
york
facility
as
compared
to
one
which
is
shipped
from
a
new
york
facility.
appellees
have
not
cited
a
single
case
in
which
this
court
has
sustained
a
state
tax
which
has
that
differential
geographical
impact,
and
to
our
knowledge
there
are
no
cases
which
do
so.
appellees'
response
really
consists
of
two
basic
arguments.
one
is
justification
by
reference
to
apportionment,
and
one
is
argument
by
analogy.
they
say
that
the
constitutionality
of
the
taxes
was
deemed
because
the
tax
is
a
properly
apportioned
income
tax.
that
argument,
i
submit,
fails
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
tax
is
not
properly
apportioned;
and
second,
and
equally
important,
apportionment
is
irrelevant
to
the
reason
why
we
are
urging
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional.
the
reason
that
the
new
york
tax
is
unconstitutional
is
that
it
results
in
a
higher
tax
rate
if
property
is
shipped
from
a
non-new
york
source
than
if
the
property
is
shipped
from
a
new
york
source.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
pardon?
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
yes.
both
owned
by
the
same
entity.
so
even
if
the
base
of
the
tax
were
proper--
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
--well,
it
might
well
go
up
in
the
sense
that
you
would
have
added
payroll
and
property
to
the
numerator
if
you
established
the
facility
in
new
york
as
opposed
to
having
the
facility
established
in
new
jersey.
but
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
effect
is
going
to
be
infinitesimal,
because
all
you're
talking
about
here
is
establishing
a
warehouse
and
handling
facility,
the
property
and
payroll
of
which
are
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
property
and
payroll
which
came
together
into
the
manufacture
and
shipment
of
the
product
in
question.
so
to
the
extent
that
the
state
relies
on
an
offsetting
increase,
i
submit
that
the
underlying
economics
will
not
support
the
argument.
now,
the
reason
why
the
formula
apportionment
defense
i
think
fails
is
because
we're
not
attacking
at
this
point
the
tax
based
on
its
basis.
we're
not
saying
that
formula
apportionment
is
wrong;
we're
saying
that
what's
wrong
is
allowing
a
credit
to
a
taxpayer
which
turns
on
the
locus
from
which
the
export
is
shipped.
and
because
that
is
the
source
of
the
unconstitutionality,
we
submit
that
the
basis
of
the
tax
is
simply
irrelevant.
or
to
put
it
another
way,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
boston
stock
exchange
case,
which
to
my
mind
involved
a
very
similar
form
of
discrimination
which
was
struck
down,
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
tax
that
stock
transfer
which
was
executed
on
the
boston
stock
exchange.
the
court
accepted
that
there
were
sufficient
contacts
with
the
state
of
new
york
to
permit
the
tax,
but
the
unconstitutionality
arose
from
the
difference
in
the
rate
of
tax
applied
because
of
where
the
transfer
was
executed.
similarly,
in
maryland
v.
louisiana,
the
taxable
incident
was
first
use
of
natural
gas
within
the
state.
the
federal
government
did
argue
that
the
first
use
also
made
the
tax
unconstitutional,
but
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
for
purposes
of
the
opinion
it
assumed
that
the
state
of
louisiana
had
sufficient
contact
with
the
first
use
to
permit
it
to
impose
a
tax.
so
that
in
both
boston
stock
exchange
and
maryland
v.
louisiana,
the
basis
of
the
tax
was
a
valid
basis,
just
as
the
appellees
here
argue
formula
apportionment
constitutes
a
valid
basis.
now,
the
appellees
seek
to
avoid
the
governing
force
of
maryland
v.
louisiana
and
boston
stock
exchange
by
suggesting
a
distinction,
and
the
distinction
is
that
in
boston
stock
exchange
and
maryland
v.
louisiana
you
were
dealing
with
a
transactional
tax
in
a
sense,
whereas
here
we're
not
dealing
with
a
transactional
tax
but
with
a
formula
apportioned
income
tax.
it's
true
that
distinction
does
exist
in
the
facts
of
the
cases,
but
appellees
have
never
suggested
any
reason
why
the
difference
in
the
tax
base
should
make
any
constitutional
difference.
and,
again,
i
submit
that
difference,
the
difference
between
formula
apportionment
and
transaction
is
irrelevant
because
the
source
of
the
unconstitutionality
is
the
discriminatory
impact
which
results
from
the
application
of
the
credit.
the
argument
by
analogy,
appellees
in
amicus
argue
that
since
they
could
constitutionally
take
a
variety
of
other
steps
to
reduce
the
impact
of
state
taxation
that
they
should
likewise
be
permitted
to
implement
the
credit
scheme
here
at
issue.
appellees'
only
authority
for
that
proposition
is
an
off-repeated
quotation
which
they
take
from
the
boston
stock
exchange
case
to
the
effect
that
states
may
use
their
taxing
power
to
compete
with
other
states
for
a
share
of
interstate
commerce.
and
then
appellees
in
amicus
go
on
to
cite
as
alternative
measures
which
they
might
constitutionally
take:
providing
police
and
fire
protection,
providing
investment
subsidies,
reduced
taxation
of
exports,
abolition
of
disc
income
taxation,
and
indeed,
abolition
of
the
corporate
income
tax
altogether.
i
submit
that
the
phrase
relied
upon
from
boston
stock
exchange
is
far
too
vague
to
provide
this
court
with
informed
guidance
for
the
resolution
of
the
particular
constitutional
questions
presented
here.
to
say
that
states
may
generally
use
their
taxing
power
to
compete
for
interstate
commerce
is
to
say
nothing
about
the
legality
of
a
tax
which
results
in
higher
rates
being
imposed
on
out-of-state
export
shipments
as
compared
to
in-state
export
shipments.
moreover,
that
language
appears
only
as
a
general
reservation
in
the
context
of
an
opinion
in
which
this
court
struck
down
a
taxing
scheme
which
is
very
similar
to
the
one
we
have
here
at
bar.
the
various
alternative
tax
and
incentive
schemes
which
new
york
adduces
as
being...
justifying
analogy
are
all
distinguishable
in
that
none
of
them
involves
a
tax
which
weighs
more
heavily
on
out-of-state
shipments
than
in-state
shipments.
of
course,
a
state
may
choose
to
abolish
taxes
on
disc
income,
on
export
income
or
on
corporate
income
altogether;
but
in
none
of
those
cases
does
the
state
create
a
tax,
the
rate
of
which
differs
depending
on
the
location
from
which
the
export
is
shipped.
were
new
york
to
exempt
a
certain
category
of
income
such
as
disc
income
or
export
income
from
tax,
that
income
would
be
exempt
from
new
york
state
tax
whatever
the
point
of
origin.
here,
however,
the
undeniable
and
undenied
effect
of
the
new
york
credit
scheme
is
to
impose
a
tax
which
is
levied
at
a
rate
of
9
percent
on
disc
income
derived
from
out-of-state
shipments
and
a
rate
of
2.7
percent
on
new
york-based
shipments.
none
of
the
hypothetical
constitutionally
permissible
analogies
suggested
by
appellees
involve
any
such
discriminatory
effect.
none
of
the
authorities
relied
upon
by
appellees
sanction
such
discrimination.
to
the
contrary,
as
i
have
said,
boston
stock
exchange
and
maryland
v.
louisiana,
the
principles
of
which
are
governing
here,
mandate
the
invalidation
of
any
tax
scheme
which
results
in
a
state
levying
heavier
taxes
on
a
transaction
because
of
its
out-of-state
locale.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
dodyk
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
i
think
the
central
thrust
of
appellees'
argument
is
that
because
the
income
which
is
being
taxed
here
is
in
some
sense
new
york
income
as
determined
by
formula
apportionment,
they
can
proceed
from
that
basis
to
structure
credit
which
clearly
discriminates
against
non-new
york
shipments.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
transaction
in
boston
stock
exchange
was
accepted
by
the
court
as
a
new
york
transaction;
that
the
first
use
tax
in
maryland
v.
louisiana
was
accepted
by
the
court
as
a
louisiana
transaction,
but
that
did
not
justify
in
grafting
on
to
that
properly
based
tax
a
set
of
limitations
which
had
a
geographically
discriminatory
effect.
thank
you,
your
honor.
