mr.
dodyk,
what
you're
saying
is
basically
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
credit
new
york
extends
you
to
be
larger
than
it
was
calculated
to
be
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
could
win
on
that
point
and
still
be
worse
off
financially
if
the
case
went
back
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
after
reversing,
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
new
york
legislature
never
would
have
enacted
the
credit
at
all
if
it
knew
that
this
was
going
to
be
the
result.
unknown
speaker
if
you
win.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
right
there,
the
shipments
that
originated
in
new
york,
were
all
of
them
made
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
so
then
it's
really
not
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce;
it's
a
discrimination
between
two
kinds
of
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
both
owned
by
the
same--
unknown
speaker
--both
owned
by
the
same
entity?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dodyk,
does
that
always
follow?
your
income
tax
might
well
go
up
if
you
ship
from
new
york,
might
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
upside
down,
though,
really?
if...
if
all
of
the
disc
income
had
arisen
from
shipments
from
new
york,
there
had
been
the
same
unitary
income
but
the
tax
would...
you
wouldn't
have
had
any
tax
on
the
disc.
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway...
anyway
your
credit
would
have
applied
to
all
the
disc
income,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
said.
that
was
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
have
collected
less
tax
if
all
of
the
disc
income
had
been
from
new
york.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't...
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
probably.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
the
credit.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
peculiar...
it
sounds
peculiar
that
your
credit
is
trying
to
identify
the
income
attributable
to
new
york
so
you
can
tax
it,
when
in
fact
you
find
out
the
income
attributable
to
new
york,
and
you
don't
tax
it.
you
give
it
a
credit.
unknown
speaker
well,
usually
when
you
identify
income
as
originating
in
the
state,
that's
when
you
tax
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
while
you're
pausing,
is
it
correct
that
the
purpose
of
the
credit
is
to
make
the...
or
to
provide
a
motive
for
these
special
export
companies
to
have
as
much
business
originate
in
new
york
as
possible?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
purpose--
unknown
speaker
--the
purpose
is
to
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
way
goods
are
shipped
overseas.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
that
the
business
transactions--
unknown
speaker
--your
purpose
is
to--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
trying
to
escape
the
word
"commerce"?
unknown
speaker
that
it
would
affect
commerce?
unknown
speaker
but
at
least
those
high
taxes
normally
affect
everybody
the
same.
unknown
speaker
but
this
one
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know--
unknown
speaker
--i
know
you
pay
more
taxes
if
you
ship
from
new
jersey
than
you
do
if
you
ship
from
new
york.
unknown
speaker
that...
that...
but
in
your
unitary
scheme
you
attribute
all
that
income
to
the
parent,
and
you
take
all
that
disc
income
into--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
taxing
the
disc
income
that
originates
in
new
jersey
at
a
higher
rate
than
if
it
originated
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
give
a
credit
to
one
and
not
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
the
point.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
wasn't
trying
to
make
that
point.
wouldn't...
wouldn't
westinghouse
have
paid
less
tax
to
new
york
if
all
of
its
shipments,
all
of
its
disc
shipments
had
been
from
new
york?
unknown
speaker
all
of
the...
all
of
the...
all
of
the...
all
of
the
shipments
in
international
trade
had
been
made
from
new
york.
unknown
speaker
if
they...
if
they
ship--
unknown
speaker
--no.
if
they
ship...
if
they...
if
instead
of
having
a
warehouse
in
delaware
they
had
one
in
new
york
and
made
the
shipments
from
there,
they
would
have
paid
less
tax.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
mr.
schiff,
can
i
interrupt
you
again?
at
page
26
of
your
brief
you
say,
"the
purpose
of
giving
the
tax
credit
is
to
prevent
export
business
being
driven
out
of
new
york.
"
you
say,
"the
credit
is
designed
to
maintain
export
business
in
new
york.
"
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
it
must...
it
must
make
a
difference
where
the
export
business
is.
unknown
speaker
you
stand
by
those
statements,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
doesn't
make
it
valid
or
invalid,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
issue
in
the
case.
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--this
one.
about
whether
you're
taxing
extraterritorially.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
get
an...
you
might
have
something
if
you
want
to
set
up
that
straw
man,
but
i
thought
it
was
a
case
of
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
what
is...
what
is
the
formula
upon
which
you
include
the
income
of
the
disc
within
your
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
but
it...
it's
treated
as
being...
the
whole
outfit
is
unitary,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
except
you
don't
include...
does
that
include
disc?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
your
position
basically
that
your
formula
that
includes
the
disc
within
the
income
that's
taxed
to
westinghouse
is
supposed
to
compute
out
only
new
york
income?
unknown
speaker
and,
therefore,
when
you're
giving
credit,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
credit
only
on
the
basis
of
new
york
income.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
new
york
in
fact,
even
though
it's
calculating
a
total
tax
on
all
the
company's
business
in
new
york,
isn't
new
york
multiplying
that
by
the
fraction
of
the
company's
total
export
business
that's
conducted
in
new
york
rather
than
simply
the
fraction
of
the
company's
new
york
business
that's
export-related?
