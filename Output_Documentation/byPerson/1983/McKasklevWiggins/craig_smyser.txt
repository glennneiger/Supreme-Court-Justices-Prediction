mr.
craig
smyser
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
contends
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
right
to
represent
himself
and
to
present
his
own
defense,
and
perhaps
the
best
response
to
the
state's
arguments
is
to
examine
that
document
the
state
refers
to
in
such
vague
terms
and
so
infrequently,
the
record
itself.
as
the
lower
court
found,
the
record
demonstrates
a
pattern
of
constant,
intentional,
uninvited
interruptions
by
standby
counsel.
mr.
craig
smyser
that
is
highly
possible,
your
honor.
however,
to
characterize
those
interruptions
as
intermittent
when
there
were
74
in
the
course
of
a
three-day
trial,
74
uninvited
interruptions,
32
of
which
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
35
of
which
were
not
accepted
by
mr.
wiggins
or
resulted
in
a
direct
conflict
between
mr.
wiggins
and
standby
counsel,
twice
the--
mr.
craig
smyser
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
at
the
hearing
in
which
mr.
wiggins,
in
which
the
trial
judge
determined
that
mr.
wiggins
was
capable
of
conducting
his
own
defense
and
waiving
his
right
to
counsel
is
not
part
of
the
record,
so
i
do
not
know
what
his
educational
background
is.
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
he
is
the
editor
of
the
legal
column
of
the
prison
magazine,
joint
endeavor,
at
huntsville.
however,
i
don't
know
whether
that
qualifies
him
to
represent
himself.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
i
have
not
counted
the
number
in
the
joint
appendix
as
compared
to
the
number
in
the
record.
the
joint
appendix
contains
the
most
egregious
instances
of
the
interruptions
by
standby
counsel
and
also
contains
illustrations
of
those
times
when
standby
counsel
was
specifically
requested
to
take
some
action,
which
i
believe
was
some
six
times
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
furthermore,
although
the
state
argues
that
in
all
instances
the
trial
judge
sustained
mr.
wiggins'
position,
this
is
incorrect.
mr.
wiggins
was
asked
by
his
standby
counsel
numerous
times
to
present
evidence
on
the
alibi
defense.
at
the
time
of
the
presentation
and
preparation
of
the
court's
charge,
mr.
wiggins
specifically
asked
the
court
not
to
include
the
alibi
defense
in
the
charge.
that
defense
was
included
in
the
charge.
three
times--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
your
honor.
as
far
as
mr.
samples'
representation
is
concerned,
there
were
only
two
instances
that
i
recall
on
the
record
in
which
mr.
samples
and
mr.
wiggins
quarrelled.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor,
he
can
do
that.
there
is
not
a
constitutional
right
to
have
standby
counsel.
mr.
craig
smyser
and,
your
honor,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
in
that
instance
he
should
be
bound,
as
your
honor
noted
in
examining
the
state,
he
should
be
bound
by
his
decisions
at
trial
just
as
if
he
had
been
represented
by
a
lawyer.
mr.
craig
smyser
pardon?
probably
to
sink,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
when
a
layman
undertakes--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
your
honor.
when
a
layman
undertakes
to
represent
himself,
that's
the
risk
he
runs.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
respondent's
position,
however,
that
the
fundamental
error
which
the
state
mentioned
which
it
must
be
on
guard
for
is
the
only
instance
in
which
a
pro
se
defendant
can
escape
the
consequences
of
his
own
decision
to
represent
himself.
mr.
craig
smyser
i
think
the
state
was...
i
think
the
state
was
correct
in
saying
five,
but
i'm
not
positive,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
it
was
raised
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
craig
smyser
i
am
not
aware
if
it
was
raised
in
any
of
the
other
five
habeas
petitions.
i
have
not
read
those.
mr.
craig
smyser
i
believe
two,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
excuse
me,
one
direct
appeal
and
one
habeas
appeal,
as
i
recall.
mr.
craig
smyser
it's
my
understanding
this
issue
was
addressed
below,
your
honor.
although
respondent--
mr.
craig
smyser
--it
is
my
understanding
that
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
this
is
much
closer
question.
we
would
submit,
however,
that
in
the
proper
case,
the
trial
court
should
not
bring
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
pro
se
defendant
as
that
would
interfere
with
his
right
to
represent
himself
unless
those
matters
involve
fundamental
error,
unless
they
involve
something
like
a
coerced
confession.
otherwise,
when
a
person
elects
to
represent
himself,
if
he
is
knowingly
and
intelligently
waiving
counsel,
he
forgoes
all
the
advantages
that
counsel
might
give
him
in
return
for
which
he
is
able
to
present
his
own
defense
to
the
jury
or
the
fact
finder.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
judge
is
obliged
to
tell
him
that.
mr.
craig
smyser
i
think
it
is
a
fundamental
right
to
have
the
opportunity
to
testify.
the
judge
cannot--
mr.
craig
smyser
--that's
what
he
loses
when
he
elects
to
represent
himself.
that
should
be
part
of
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
knowingly
and
intelligently
waiving
counsel.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
judge
has
any
obligation
to--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
your
honor,
unless
it
involves
fundamental
error.
your
hypothetical,
i
may
not
quite
understand
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state
is
presenting
tainted
evidence,
if
the
state
is
presenting
evidence
that
somehow
is
not--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
your
honor,
and
the
same
situation
would
arise
if
the
man
had
ineffective
counsel
and
the
counsel
did
not
know
it,
this
court
would
be
called
upon
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
counsel,
by
not
having
found
out
that
this
prosecution
witness
had
three
previous--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
so,
and
i
feel
as
if
i
am
perhaps
rearguing
faretta
here,
but
i
do
feel
that
the--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
at
times
seem
that
i
am
arguing
the
dissents
in
faretta.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
think,
although
it
was
dicta,
the
footnote
46
in
which
this
court
held
the
state
may
appoint
standby
counsel
even
over
the
objection
of
an
accused,
to
aid
the
accused
if
and
when
the
accused
requests
help
or
to
take
over
the
trial
if
the
accused
becomes
unruly,
is
a
clear,
unambiguous
language.
it
clearly
states
the
standard
that...
the
standard
applies
to
protect
the
accused's
right
to
present
his
personal
defense.
there
is
no
need
for
a
new
standard.
this
court
has
elaborated
the
standard
in
faretta,
and
there
is
no
need
to
posit
this
standard
of
a
genuine
opportunity
to
conduct
one's
defense.
furthermore,
respondent
would
contend
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
whatever
standard
the
court
adopts,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
egregious
that
it
should
be...
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
craig
smyser
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
state's
standard
would
in
fact
open
the
door
to
a
case-by-case
examination
of
the
record.
mr.
craig
smyser
what
we
have
here,
if
this
court
announces
a
standard
that
standby
counsel
should
aid
only
if
and
when
requested
to
do
so,
we
have
a
bright
line
rule
which
is
easy
of
application,
which
everyone
then
knows
their
position
in
a
criminal
trial,
and--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
i
believe,
your
honor,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
faretta
said
that
the
state
may
appoint
standby
counsel
to
aid
the
accused
if
and
when
the
accused
requests
help.
i
think
that
is
in
footnote
46
of
faretta,
and
that
is,
i
submit,
the
standard
the
fifth
circuit
applied
and
the
proper
standard
that
should
be
used
to
review
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
my
position
is
actually
a
little
more
flexible
than
that.
i
believe
that
if
there
is...
if
any
words
uttered
by
standby
counsel
only
constitute
an
incidental
interference
with
the
presentation
of
the
defense,
that
it
should
not
be
reversible
error.
the
judge
has
the
ability
to
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
the
remarks,
or
if
counsel
is
attempting
to
sandbag,
which
is
one
of
the
arguments
the
state
raises,
attempt
to
sandbag
the
proceedings,
the
trial
judge
can
use
contempt
or
order
counsel
to
resume
his
seat.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
standby
counsel,
if
appointed,
as
a
traditional
friend
of
the
court
has
the
duty
to
attempt
to
prevent
fundamental
error.
mr.
craig
smyser
pardon?
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
in
most
cases
fundamental
error
is
pretty
easily
identifiable.
i
may
be
wrong,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
ordinary
type
of
error
we
are
talking
about
should
not
sanction
the
interference
by
standby
counsel.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
he
should
not
do
that.
mr.
craig
smyser
he
should
not
do
that.
now,
this...
the--
mr.
craig
smyser
--the
point--
mr.
craig
smyser
--sir?
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
is...
and
the
important
thing
to
realize
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
well
is
that
it
is
the
accused's
defense
and
it
is
his
request.
he
can
ask
the
standby
counsel,
you
know,
i
want
to
conduct
my
defense
but
i
went
you
to
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
and
tell
me
when
i've
got
a
good
argument
to
make
or
a
good
cross
examination
to
make.
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
he
specifically
asked
to
be
relieved
of
standby
counsel's
interruptions.
he
specifically
asked
that
standby
counsel
not
move
for
mistrial.
three
times
after
the
specific
request,
standby
counsel
stood
up
and
moved
for
mistrial.
these
are
instances
not
where
the
standby
counsel
has
a
rapport
with
the
defendant.
it
is
a
case
where
the
standby
counsel
and
defendant
were
like
cats
and
dogs
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
i
don't
think
he
had
that
obligation.
i
would--
mr.
craig
smyser
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
he
has
a
right
to
do
that
if
it
interferes
with
the
presentation
of
the
defense.
if
the
defendant
is
outside
the
courtroom
and
he
wants
to
dictate
something
in
the
record
to
protect
himself,
i
personally
don't
think
standby
counsel
has
anything
to
protect.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
relationship
between
the
accused
and
standby
counsel.
if
the
accused
has
said
specifically,
i
don't
want
to
hear
from
you--
mr.
craig
smyser
--i
think
that's
the
end
of
it,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
craig
smyser
--your
honor,
it
it
is
perjured
testimony
and
the
government
is
aware
that
it
is
perjured
testimony,
i
submit
the
prosecution
has
the
duty,
the
ethical
duty,
not
to
put
perjured
testimony
on
the
stand.
mr.
craig
smyser
would
i
require
that
the
accused
ask
it?
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not,
because
the--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
the--
mr.
craig
smyser
--as
the
judge?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
although
i
submit--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
because
this
goes
to
the
very
notion
of
why
a
person
elects
to
represent
himself.
that
defendant
may
have
no
interest
in
acquittal.
he
may
be
making--
mr.
craig
smyser
--in
a
hypothetical
case,
he
may
have
no
interest
in
acquittal.
he
may
he
making
as
in--
mr.
craig
smyser
--no,
your
honor,
as
in
u.s.
v.
dougherty,
the
second
circuit
decision,
some
defendants
elect
to
make
a
political
statement.
they
want
to
represent
themselves
because
they
have
knowingly
broken
the
law,
but
they
want
to
bring
their
position
to
the
court.
in
that
instance,
the
defendant
has
no
interest
in
his
guilt
or
his
innocence.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
ignore
that
public
interest
at
all.
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
public
interest,
but
i
think
it
was
the
interest
that
was
argued
in
faretta
and
was
decided
in
faretta.
the
trial
process
itself
has
built
into
it--
mr.
craig
smyser
--your
honor,
i
think
faretta...
faretta
does
not
have
to
be
overruled
in
the
sense
that
the
accused
can
have
the
right
to
represent
himself.
i
think
that
that
language
in
faretta
where
it
says
if
and
when
an
accused
requests
help,
that
language
must
be
disapproved.
i
do
not
think
faretta,
the
entire
decision,
has
to
be
overruled.
and
i
think,
to
further
answer
your
honor's
question
as
to
the
societal
interest,
which
i
think
is
the
hardest
question
in
this
case,
i
think
those
guarantees
of
fairness
are
built
into
the
trial
process
and
that
the
pro
se
defendant
will
be
bound
by
his
trial
decisions
just
as
a
defendant
represented
by
a
lawyer.
if
there
is
a
fundamentally
unjust
incarceration,
if
there
is
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice,
he
will
meet
the
cause
and
actual
prejudice
standard,
if
he
has
a
procedural
waiver
of
one
of
his
rights
at
trial,
as
announced
by
this
court.
the
trial
judge
likewise
has
the
duty
to
prevent
fundamental
error,
and
the
prosecution,
as
i
have
mentioned,
has
a
duty
not
merely
to
obtain
a
conviction,
but
to
obtain
a
just
conviction.
mr.
craig
smyser
well,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
under
even
the
state's
analysis,
even
under
their
analysis
of
the
opportunity
to
control
his
defense,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
too
egregious
to
fit
even
under
that
standard.
the
standard
i
am
advancing
here
is
the
standard
which
was
promulgated
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
which
i
believe
this
court
announced
in
the
footnote
in
faretta
which
i
previously
referred
to.
even
under
the
state
standard,
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
clear
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
represent
himself.
mr.
craig
smyser
i
think
the
state
does,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes.
i
think--
mr.
craig
smyser
--well,
as
a
threshold
determination
to
determine
that
he
was
violated--
mr.
craig
smyser
--yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
initial
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
his
constitutional
right
was
violated.
i
think
this
case
has
a
second
issue
which
was
not
addressed
by
the
state,
and
that
issue
is,
as
was
raised
by
justice
blackmun
in
his
dissent
in
faretta,
can
a
violation
of
the
right
to
self-representation
ever
be
harmless
error?
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
craig
smyser
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals...
the
respondent
contends
that
the
harmless
error
rule
should
not
apply
to
denials
of
the
right
to
conduct
one's
own
defense.
it
is
one
of
those
constitutional
rights
so
basic
to
a
fair
trial
that
its
infraction
can
never
be
treated
as
harmless
error.
it's
most
obvious
logical
counterpart
is
the
right
to
counsel,
and
this
court
in
holloway
v.
arkansas...
it
involved
a
question
of
whether
the
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
could
ever
be
harmless
error,
and
in
holding
that
it
couldn't
be,
this
court
held
and
noted
that
in
the
normal
case
where
the
harmless
error
rule
is
applied,
the
error
is
readily
identifiable.
put
that
was
not
the
case
with
the
right
to
counsel.
likewise,
in
this
case,
the
error
is
not
readily
identifiable.
furthermore,
the
harmless
error
rule,
at
least
in
its
traditional
application,
involves
a
result-oriented
inquiry.
the
constitutional
right
at
stake
here,
denial
of
the
right
to
represent
yourself,
is
not
a
result-oriented
right.
it
is
given
to
the
accused
to
present
his
personal
defense.
therefore
the
traditional
notion
of
the
harmless
error
rule
is
inapplicable.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
however,
did
apply
another
version
of
the
harmless
error
rule
in
which
the
focus
was
on
the
impact
on
the
defense
rather
than
the
impact
on
the
result
at
trial.
respondent
submits
that
if
the
harmless
error
rule
is
applied,
this
is
the
correct
application
of
that
rule.
since
this
case
involves
a
man's
right
to
represent
himself,
i
think
it
only
appropriate
that
i
conclude
with
a
brief
statement
authored
by
mr.
wiggins
which
he
ask
i
read
to
the
court.
for
sake
of
perspective,
mr.
wiggins
says,
i
respectfully
request
the
justices
to
consider
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
a
trial
judge
forces
a
defense
attorney
who
is
representing
a
client
to
accept
two
other
counsel
for
standby
purposes
against
the
wishes
of
the
attorney
and
allows
interference
by
standby
counsels
to
the
same
extent
as
in
the
instant
case.
if
this
situation
were
ever
to
occur
in
a
trial,
it
can
be
seen
more
clearly
that
the
state's
genuine
opportunity
to
defend
argument
is
without
merit
and
totally
unworkable.
if
an
american
citizen's
right
to
present
a
defense
without
counsel
is
at
least
equal
to
one's
right
to
have
counsel,
then
that
defendant
should
not
be
required
to
have
an
albatross
about
his
or
her
neck
any
more
than
should
the
attorney
who
would
be
trying
to
defend
a
client.
for
these
reasons,
respondent
respectfully
prays
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit?
