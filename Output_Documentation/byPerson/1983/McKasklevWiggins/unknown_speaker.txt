unknown
speaker
now,
two
counsel
were
appointed,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
through
the
briefs
i
find
small
mention
of
mr.
samples,
was
that
his
name?
did
he
just
sit
by
and
do
nothing?
unknown
speaker
so
your
opposition
would
take
the
position
that
the
two
counsels
stood
in
stark
contrast
one
to
the
other.
unknown
speaker
counsel?
unknown
speaker
ms.
benitez,
under
faretta,
do
you
think
a
trial
judge
is
permitted,
once
a
defendant
invokes
his
right
to
represent
himself,
to
say
okay,
fine,
but
you
are
on
your
own?
i
am
not
doing
to
appoint
any
standby
counsel
because
there
are
just
too
many
problems
such
as
might
have
emerged
in
this
case.
do
you
think
the
trial
court
is
under
any
obligation
to
appoint
standby
counsel?
unknown
speaker
why
do
so
many
of
them
do
it,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
when
the
defendant
has
elected
to
go
on
his
own,
i
would
think
the
trial
court
would
feel
relieved
of
that
sort
of
responsibility.
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
some
of
the
cases
in
which
after
a
defendant
asserted
his
faretta
right
to
try
his
own
case
and
the
court
did
not
appoint
counsel
to
stand
by,
and
then
later
that
same
defendant
attacked
the
results
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
should
have
appointed
someone
one
a
standby
basis?
have
you
cited
any
of
those
cases
here?
unknown
speaker
ms.
benitez,
let
me
take
up
once
more
the
subject
i
asked
you
about
earlier.
i
gather
from
this
last
incident
you
have
described
that
it
is
the
general
practice
in
texas,
the
feeling
of
the
trial
judge,
that
a
defendant
who
chooses
to
invoke
his
faretta
rights
really
can't
get
even
a
fundamentally
fair
trial
without
standby
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
happened,
if
this
was
tried
in
1972,
if
this
is
happening,
the
federal
habeas
is
eleven
years
later?
do
you
happen
to
know
off
hand?
unknown
speaker
he
finally
made
the
grade.
unknown
speaker
ms.
benitez,
this
is
irrelevant,
but
what
has
happened
to
mr.
estelle
who
is
on
so
many
cases
here?
is
he
no
longer
in
office?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
another
way
of
preventing
relitigation
of
those
things
would
be
for
it
to
be
established
that
a
faretta
defendant
is
genuinely
on
his
own
and
that
what
he
doesn't
object
to
at
trial
he
can't
raise
later.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
prosecutor
as
well
has
obligations
to
ensure
a
basically
fair
proceeding,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
ms.
benitez,
to
agree
with
you,
do
we
have
either
to
overrule
faretta
or
substantially
to
retreat
from
it?
unknown
speaker
permitted,
permitted,
do
you
mean
the
judge
just
didn't
tell
him
to
sit
down?
nobody
gave
him
permission,
especially
the
defendant,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
about
that
reaction
of
the
judge?
should
he
have
told
counsel
to
be
quiet
unless
he's
got
permission?
unknown
speaker
of
course
he
could
have...
he
could
have
advised
him
any
time,
but
should
he,
should
he,
should
he
have?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
that
desirable
way
of
proceeding
is
constitutionally
required,
apparently,
because
that
didn't
happen
here.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
judge
didn't
follow
that
course
here.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he
didn't
early
in
the
trial.
he
did
not
early
in
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge
is
dealing
with
a
two-headed
monster,
basically.
you
don't
know...
the
judge
doesn't
know
who
is
in
charge,
the
standby
counsel
or
the
defendant,
it
seems
to
me.
i
wonder
how
easy
to
apply
your
test
would
be
where
you
say
serious,
fundamental
fairness
is
impaired.
at
that
point
the
standby
counsel
may
speak
up.
now,
one
of
the
colloquies
is
over
whether
the
person
should
be
cross...
a
witness
should
be
cross
examined,
and
the
defendant
says
i
want
to
do
it,
and
mr.
graham
says
we'll
get
him
later.
now,
i
suppose
counsel
could
say,
well,
cross
examination
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
think...
finish.
unknown
speaker
i
don't...
earlier
said
that
the
standby
counsel
would
certainly
be
obliged
to
move
in
if
the
judge
had
obviously
made
an
inadvertent
mistake.
do
you
still
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i
can't
conceive
of
what's
wrong
with
that.
certainly
the
judge
can
get
an
amicus
at
any
time
on
his
own
motion.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
approve
all
that
he
did,
though,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
approve
all
he
did.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
some
of
his
language.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
about
the
record?
as
i
understand
it,
the
trial
lasted
about
three
and
a
half
days?
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
about
30
pages
of
material
in
the
appendix
which
contain
a
number
of
these
incidents.
are
these
representative
of
the
entire
trial,
or
are
these
all
of
the
examples
that
support
the
lawyer's
injecting
himself
into
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
this
is
all
there
is
in
the
whole
three-day
trial?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
maybe
because
he
thought
that
the
man
was
ruining
his
own
case.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
demonstration
of
mr.
wiggins'
capacity,
training
and
education
to
try
to
defend
himself
in
a
criminal
case?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
education
or
experience
was
shown
to
suggest
that
he
was
qualified
to
try
to
his
own
case?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
since
you
have
enumerated
the
number
of
times,
are
all
74
of
the
examples
that
you
referred
to
in
the
joint
appendix?
unknown
speaker
of
what...
what
proportion
did
you
bother
to
put
in?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
critical
of
the
other
standby
counsel?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smyser,
looking
over
the
transcript,
do
you
agree
that
this
was
a
rather
cumbersome
way
of
trying
a
case?
unknown
speaker
what
can
a
trial
judge
do
to
protect
himself
as
much
as
possible
against
this
cumbersomeness?
can
he
simply
refuse
to
appoint
standby
counsel,
saying
i
know
this
kind
of
a
conflict
is
going
to
occur,
i
have
done
it
before
and
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
this
time,
and
simply
let
the
pro
se
defendant
sink
or
swim?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
supposing
the
defendant
afterwards
comes
in
and
says,
well,
if
only
i
had
known,
i
would
have
made
these
objections.
i
didn't
know,
so
it
ought
to
be
set
aside
because
there
were
these
constitutional
violations
which
i
admittedly
didn't
object
to
at
the
time.
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
to
sink
or
swim,
or
to
sink?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
now,
let
me
take
that
last
statement
of
yours.
are
you
eliminating
incompetence
of
representation,
lack
of
adequate
representation
just
because
a
layman
has
made
that
judgment
that
he
wants
to
try
his
own
case?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
he
is
forever
foreclosed.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
you
know,
some
courts
have
not
agreed
with
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smyser.
mr
smyser.
go
ahead.
how
many
petitions
for
habeas
corpus,
federal
habeas
corpus,
has
petitioner
filed...
or
respondent?
unknown
speaker
was
this
issue
raised
in
any
of
those?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
how
many
state
collateral
proceeding
were
instituted
by
respondent?
unknown
speaker
was
the
issue--
unknown
speaker
--was
this
issue
addressed
in
any
of
those,
either
of
those?
unknown
speaker
it
was
raised
and
addressed
in
the
state
system
on
direct
appeal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smyser,
suppose
during
the
trial
that
the
trial
court
itself
had
raised
some
objections
as
the
proceedings
went
along
in
an
effort
to
ensure
the
defendant's
rights
were
protected,
or
suppose
even
the
prosecutor
had
undertaken
to
intervene
at
some
point
on
the
defendant's
behalf,
would
his
sixth
amendment
rights
be
violated
by
action
of
either
of
those?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think--
--do
you
think
the
judge
is
obliged
to
tell
him
that
he
doesn't
have
to
take
the
witness
stand
unless
he
wants
to?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
a
fundamental
right,
not
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
doesn't
know
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
prosecution
witnesses
testify
so
that
the
judge
sitting
on
the
bench,
presumably
having
had
litigation
experience
and
judicial
experience,
sees
clearly
that
the
prosecution
witness
is
very
vulnerable
and
could
be
destroyed
on
cross
examination?
there
being
no
counsel,
if
the
defendant
himself,
acting
as
his
own
faretta
counsel,
doesn't
cross
examine
does
the
judge
have
any
obligation
to
suggest
that
cross
examination
be
conducted,
or
does
he
have
an
obligation
to
do
the
cross
examining
himself?
unknown
speaker
even
if
he
thinks
that
a
conviction
may
be
had
that
is
wrongly
resulting
from
this
incompetence?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
judge,
to
make
it
more
concrete,
suppose
the
judge
knows
firsthand
from
having
tried
the...
presided
over
the
trial
of
the
person
who
is
the
prosecution
witness,
that
the
man
was
convicted,
when
he
was,
he
the
judge
was
the
presiding
judge,
and
at
that
time
had
three
felony
convictions
before?
the
judge
knows
this.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
judge
should
let
this
man
blunder
along
and
not
see
to
it
that
that
question
about
the
credibility
of
that
prosecution
witness
is
called
to
the
attention
if
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
that's
another
question.
unknown
speaker
i'm
speaking,
a
lawyer
in
the
case
is
presumed
to
know
something
about
what
he
is
doing.
there
can
hardly
be
any
presumption
that
this
man
knew
how
to
try
a
criminal
case.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
the
judge
has
no
obligation
whatever
to
step
in
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
which
side
are
you
on?
yes.
you
are
arguing
perhaps
the
dissents
in
faretta.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
your
colleague?
do
you
think
that
if
the
state
is
to
prevail
here
we
have
to
overruled
faretta?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smyser,
when
you
said
we
would
have
to
overruled
faretta
if
we
conclude
to
overrule
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me
is
that
a
number
of
judges
have
held
after
reviewing
the
record
which
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
do,
that
there
was
no
violation
of
faretta.
we
start
at
the
magistrater
court
in
which
he
concludes
that
wiggins
was
indeed
allowed
the
right
to
conduct
his
own
defense,
and
then
circuit
district
judge
spears
said
he
had
reviewed
the
record
carefully
and
fully
agreed
with
the
magistrate's
conclusion.
then
the
panel,
three
judges
on
the
panel
of
ca
5
disagreed,
but
five
judges
joined
judge
jolly,
four
joined
jolly
making
a
total
of
five,
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
who
thought
faretta
had
been
complied
with.
so
if
you
just
took
a
gallup
poll,
you
would
have
a
vote
of
seven
to
three,
and
i
wonder
whether
appellate
courts
have
to
get
into
this
sort
of
business
case
after
case
whenever
this
issue
is
raised,
and
should
we
leave
it
to
the
trial
judge
to
decide?
unknown
speaker
what
do
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
faretta
didn't
say
that.
you
want
us
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
ca
5
did
say
counsel
should
be
seen
and
not
head.
unknown
speaker
not
a
word.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
there
circumstances
in
which
under
your
view
standby
counsel
without
consulting
the
defendant
and
without
his
approval,
without
asking
the
judge,
may
intervene?
unknown
speaker
then
you
would--
--so
the
bright
line
isn't
very
bright,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
said
the
line
isn't
very
bright.
unknown
speaker
well,
apart
from
fundamental
error,
is
it
your
position
that
counsel
must
remain
mute
unless
the
defendant
asks
for
help?
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
the
lawyer
is
sitting
there,
thanks
of
a
real
good
question
to
ask
on
cross
examination,
he
may
not
even
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
say
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make?
unknown
speaker
he
should
not
do
that.
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
is
perfectly
obvious,
it
is
not
fundamental
in
any
constitutional
sense
but
it
might
be
the
difference
between
a
not
guilty
verdict
and
a
guilty
verdict,
he
had
still
better
keep
his
mouth
shut?
unknown
speaker
i
find
that--
--you
don't
certainly
need
to
go
that
far.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
say
that
the
lawyer
can't
even
consult
with
his
client,
or
with
his
friend?
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
your
recent
statement,
your
recent
standard
that
you
announced,
back
to
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
earlier.
the
standby
counsel,
like
the
trial
judge,
is
fully
conscious
that
the
prosecution's
witness
is
very
vulnerable
and
can
be
destroyed
on
cross
examination,
so
he
taps
his
friend
on
the
shoulder
and
says
this
man
ought
to
be
cross
examined,
and
i
know
how
to
do
it.
will
you
let
me
go
ahead?
and
the
man
says
no,
no.
what's
the
obligation
of
that
lawyer
at
that
point?
should
he
remain
mute
or
should
he
go
to
the
bench
and
say
to
the
court,
i
have
just
advised
the
defendant,
describing
what
happened,
and
i
know
the
man
has
a
criminal
record.
i
can
destroy
him
on
cross
examination,
and
i
want
the
record
to
show
that
he
won't
let
me
do
it.
is
that...
is
the
lawyer
entitled
to
do
that
to
protect
himself?
unknown
speaker
has
he
a
right
to
do
it
to
protect
himself?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
try
one.
standby
counsel
says
that
this
government
witness
was
found
guilty
of
perjury
last
year,
and
the
reason
i
know,
i
defended
him.
now,
he
can't
do
anything
about
that?
unknown
speaker
the
accused,
he
tells
the
accused,
and
the
accused
said
so
what?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
that's
the
end
of
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
end
of
all
decency
in--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
convicted
somebody
on
perjured
testimony.
unknown
speaker
you're
introducing
another
element.
if
the
prosecution
knows
about
it,
and
justice
marshall
is
trying
to
get
some
way
of
letting
the
court
and
the
prosecution
know.
well,
let
me
ask
you
something.
if
you
were
trying
a
case
and
you
were
a
lawyer,
and
you
were
the
judge,
and
the
lawyer
said
this
man
was
convicted
of
perjury,
would
you
let
that
question
be
asked?
unknown
speaker
would
you,
yes?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
let
it,
you
wouldn't
let
the
question
be
asked?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
ask
it
yourself
either,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
would
you?
unknown
speaker
no,
sir,
i
said
you're
the
lawyer,
and
you
tell
the
judge
that
this
witness
is
a
convicted
perjurer
and
that
question
should
be
brought
out.
could
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
couldn't
either?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
ask
that
question.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is,
were
you
convicted
of
perjury?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
he
may
have
no
interest
in
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
he
likes
jail.
unknown
speaker
well,
faretta
doesn't
have
to
be
overruled
for
the
state
to
win
in
this
case,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
is
the
point.
each
of
them
can
interfere
perhaps
to
the
same
extent
as
standby
counsel
did
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smyser,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
the
state?
unknown
speaker
at
the
threshold?
unknown
speaker
the
defendant
makes
a
charge
that
he
