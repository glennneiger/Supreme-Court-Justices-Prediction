ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
pending
before
the
court
on
the
petition
of
texas
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
granting
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
the
sole
issue
involved
herein
is
whether
a
criminal
defendant
who
invokes
his
faretta
v.
california
right
of
self-representation
suffers
a
constitutional
deprivation
if
standby
counsel
intermittently
participates
in
the
trial
proceedings.
i
will
first
briefly
discuss
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
holdings
of
the
court
below
and
then
will
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
when
a
defendant
invokes
his
constitutional
right
of
self-representation,
standby
counsel
must
in
all
circumstances
be
seen
and
not
heard.
respondent's
first
trial
was
in
san
antonio,
texas
in
january
of
1973.
he
was
convicted
and
received
a
life
sentence.
his
conviction,
however,
was
reversed
due
to
a
defective
indictment.
his
second
trial,
and
that
which
is
the
subject
of
the
instant
proceedings,
occurred
in
june
1973.
again,
respondent
was
convicted
and
received
a
life
sentence.
at
this
trial
respondent
chose
to
proceed
pro
se
and
represent
himself.
the
trial
court,
however,
over
respondent's
objections,
appointed
standby
counsel.
the
record
reflects
that
standby
counsel
participated
intermittently
in
the
trial
proceedings.
counsel
made
some
objections
to
evidence,
he
urged
motions
to
the
trial
court
and
presented
some
argument
to
the
jury.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
the
record
reflects
that
he
participated
to
a
very
limited
extent
by
occasionally
bringing
a
matter
or
two
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
but
he
did
participate
hardly
at
all
in
the
trial
proceedings.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
i
don't
believe
that
respondent
has
particularly
made
that
argument,
but
the
record
does
reflect
that
that
is
the
case.
some
of
the
intermittent
participation
of
counsel
was
overtly
encouraged
by
respondent,
some
was
done
without
objection
by
him,
and
some
was
done
over
his
objection.
the
record
does
reflect,
however,
that
most
of
the
assistance
provided
by
standby
counsel
did
occur
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
record
also
reflects
that
counsel
inexcusably
and
indefensibly
twice
cursed,
once
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
more
importantly,
however,
for
this
court's
analysis,
the
record
reflects
that
respondent
himself
made
the
decision
to
proceed
to
trial
in
this
case,
examined
the
jury
panel
and
selected
the
jurors,
argued
both
pretrial
and
trial
motions
to
the
court,
cross
examined
the
state's
witnesses,
chose
his
defensive
theory
and
strategy,
presented
and
examined
his
own
witnesses,
and
argued
his
case
to
the
jury.
there
were
times
during
the
course
of
the
trial
when
conflict
arose
between
standby
counsel
and
respondent.
the
record,
however,
reflects
that
the
trial
court
always
and
without
exception
recognized
respondent's
right
to
make
the
necessary
decisions
and
sustained
the
respondent's
position.
the
district
court
on
federal
habeas
corpus
review
reviewed
the
entire
record
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
held
that
on
the
record
as
a
whole
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
accorded
his
right
under
faretta
v.
california.
the
fifth
circuit,
however,
reversed,
holding
that
the
limited
participation
of
standby
counsel
constituted
a
denial
of
respondent's
faretta
right,
and
that
the
conviction
must
be
set
aside.
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
strictly
applied
faretta
and
held
that
when
a
defendant
invokes
his
constitutional
right
to
self-representation
under
faretta,
standby
counsel
must
be
seen
and
not
heard
and
that
interference
by
standby
counsel
will
result
in
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
trial
court
does
have
that
obligation.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
i
believe
that
the
trial
courts
do
it
because
it
makes
the
trial
in
a
case
such
as
the
instant
case
less
burdensome
to
the
trial
court.
for
the
trial
court
to
have
a
party
there
who
is
present
through
the
trial
proceedings
to
whom
he
can
refer
the
pro
se
defendant
when
matters
arise
that
require
that
the
defendant
be
advised
of
courtroom
procedures
or
other
matters
which
the
trial
court
wants
the
defendant
to
be
aware
of.
i
believe
that
it
is
the
interest...
that
trial
courts
do
it
for,
basically
for
two
reasons:
one,
so
that
there
will
be
an
attorney
there
who
can
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
necessary
matters
which,
for
example,
counsel
notices
but
the
trial
court
doesn't
notice.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
argument
to
that
effect
that
the
respondent
has
made
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
also
has
an
interest
in
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial
proceedings
and
has
an
interest
in
ensuring
that
a
criminal
defendant
who
is
going
to
be
convicted
pursuant
to
that
court's
judgment
obtains
a
fundamentally
fair
trial.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
your
honor,
i
believe
that
those
that
the...
that
some
of
those
cases
have
been
cited.
i
believe
so
because
that
argument
has
been
raised
from
time
to
time
by
pro
se
defendants.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
the
essence
of
the
right
protected
in
faretta
is
the
opportunity
for
the
criminal
defendant
to
manage,
control
and
conduct
his
own
defense,
to
personally
participate
in
the
proceedings,
and
to
personally
argue
his
case
to
the
finders
of
the
fact,
and
this
opportunity
the
respondent
in
this
case
clearly
had.
rather
than
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
a
standard
of
review
which
inquires
into
whether
or
not
a
pro
se
defendant
had
a
genuine
opportunity
to
act
in
his
own
behalf,
to
manage
and
control
his
own
defense,
and
to
reject
the
notion
that
some
assistance
provided
by
standby
counsel,
even
that
assistance
provided
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant,
constitutes
constitutional
error
entitling
the
defendant
to
either
habeas
corpus
relief
or
a
reversal
of
his
criminal
conviction.
to
hold
otherwise,
we
submit,
would
totally
bind
the
hands
of
standby
counsel
when
counsel
sees
some
matter
occurring
during
the
trial
which
might
result
in
a
serious
due
process
violation
from
bringing
that
matter
to
the
trial
court's
attention
or,
in
fact,
from
interjecting
himself
into
the
proceedings
in
time
to
prevent
such
error
from
occurring.
more
importantly,
however,
we
urge
that
the
rigid
rule
of
the
fifth
circuit
would
place
upon
the
trial
courts
in
these
cases
the
responsibility
for
sometimes
acting
in
the
role
of
an
advocate
for
the
criminal
defendant
where
the
court
sees
that
some
error
is
occurring
or
is
about
to
occur
which
threatens
to
undermine
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
an
example
of
that
happened
in
the
instant
case
where
the
record
reflects
that
the
trial
judge
trying
this
case
usually
sat
to
hear
civil
cases.
when
he
brought
the
jury
panel
into
the
courtroom,
he
began
to
instruct
them
on
basic
principles
of
criminal
law.
the
trial
court
then
inadvertently
and
mistakenly
advised
that
jury
panel
that
the
respondent
was
being
tried
as
a
repeater,
or
a
repeat
offender,
indicating
to
the
jury
that
the
respondent
had
a
prior
criminal
record--
standby
counsel
at
that
point
made
an
objection
and
pointed
out
to
the
trial
court
that
that
was
error.
the
trial
court,
recognizing
that
he
had
committed
error
inadvertently,
then
quashed
the
entire
panel
and
seated
another
panel
who
eventually
heard
respondent's
case.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
no,
your
honor,
i
can't
represent
that
that
is
the
position
of
all
the
trial
judges
in
texas.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
this
particular
case
which
was
tried
in
1972,
the
trial
judge
was...
this
was,
of
course,
prior
to
faretta
and
prior
to
this
court's
opinion
recognizing
the
federal
constitutional
right.
however,
in
texas
for
many,
many
years
a
defendant
had
had
a
right
to
proceed
pro
se,
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
long
recognized
a
federally
constitutionally
protected
right
to
act
in
his
own
behalf.
what
i
am
urging
is
that
the
trial
court...
the
trial
court
should
have
the
discretion
to
appoint
standby
counsel
as
he
does,
but
also
to
allow
counsel
to
act
almost
in
the
role
of
an
amicus.
if
the
trial
court
perceives
that
some
error
is
occurring
in
the
trial
or
if
the
trial
court
wants
someone
there
who
might
bring
to
his
attention
error
which
the
trial
court
commits
and
doesn't
recognize
at
the
time,
such
as
the
error
which
was
committed
in
this
case.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
yes,
your
honor.
the
respondent
in
this
case
filed
a
direct
appeal,
has
filed
numerous,
i
believe,
five
or
six
state
habeas
actions
and
several
federal
actions
also.
the
case
is...
the
respondent
has
been
litigating
the
validity
of
his
conviction
since
that
time
through
the
state
courts
and
through
the
federal
courts.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
mr.
estelle
has
resigned
as
director
of
texas
department
of
corrections,
and
mr.
mckaskle
is
now
the
acting
director.
the
respondent
in
this
case
argues
that
there
can
be
no
valid
reason
for
standby
counsel
ever
to
speak
of
and
voice
an
objection
to
the
proceedings
citing
this
court's
procedural
default
cases
such
as
wainwright
v.
sykes
and
engle
v.
isaac.
we
urge,
however,
that
this
argument
ignores
doctrines
recognized
by
the
courts,
both
state
and
federal,
of
plain
error
and
fundamental
error,
which
is
error
requiring
reversal
even
in
the
absence
of
any
objection.
it
is
also
true
that
absent
some
ability
on
the
part
of
standby
counsel
to
speak
up
and
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
some
matter
which
threatens
to
undermine
the
basic
fairness
of
the
proceedings,
this
would
have
the
result
of
perhaps
undermining
the
finality
of
criminal
convictions
also
in
that
if
some
error
were
occurring
of
the
trial
and
standby
counsel
were
permitted
to
voice
objection
to
it
at
that
time,
the
trial
court
would
have
the
opportunity
to
take
remedial
action,
thus
removing
error
from
the
case
before
the
individual
was
convicted
and
the
case
went
up
on
appeal
before
a
reviewing
court.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that's
true,
and
i
think
under
most
circumstances
that
would
be
the
result
and
that
would
be
the
holding
of
the
reviewing
court.
there
are
some
matters,
however,
which
courts
will
find
go...
infect
the
proceedings
to
such
an
extent
that
the
trial
was
fundamentally
unfair,
and
the
reviewing
courts
will
reverse
the
conviction
absent
any
objection,
whether
the
defendant
was
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
and
we
would
submit
that
it
is
this
interest
of
the
courts
and
the
state
and
also
the
defendants
in
some
finality
of
the
convictions
to
permit
standby
counsel
to
raise
some
objections
to
the
trial
court.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
yes,
that
is
true,
and
i
think
that
there
is,
under
most
circumstances,
a
much
greater
burden
on
the
prosecutor
to
make
sure
of
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings
when
a
defendant
is
acting
pro
se.
but
as
this
court
is
aware,
and
as
all
courts
are
aware,
error
sometimes
occurs,
and
sometimes
even
inadvertent
error
can
do
grave
harm
to
constitutionally
protected
rights.
so
we
would
ask
this
court,
in
addition
to
recognizing
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
proceeding
pro
se,
to
also
recognize
the
interests
of
both
the
state
and
the
courts
in
ensuring
that
fundamental
fairness
occurs
in
criminal
proceedings.
while
certainly
these
interests
cannot
override
the
interests
of
the
pro
se
defendant,
as
this
court
held
in
faretta,
we
submit
that
all
interests
can
be
protected
if
this
court
adopts
a
standard
of
review
on
a
case-by-case
basis
which
inquires
into
whether
a
pro
se
defendant
had
a
genuine
opportunity
to
manage,
control
and
conduct
his
defense.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
would
even
have
to
substantially
retreat
from
faretta
in
order
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
because
the
position
that
we
are
taking
is
not
inconsistent
with
faretta.
the
language
which
the
respondent
relies
upon
heavily,
found
in
a
footnote
in
faretta
which
states
that
standby
counsel
must
be...
should
be
ready
to
provide
assistance
if
and
when
the
defendant
requests
it,
i
believe
properly
defines
the
role
of
standby
counsel,
but
what
issue...
what
was
not
before
the
court
in
deciding
faretta
is
what
happens
where
the
defendant
proceeds
pro
se
and
is
allowed
to
represent
himself,
clearly
to
make
strategic
decisions,
to
examine
witnesses,
to
argue
his
case
to
the
jury,
but
standby
counsel
is
permitted
intermittently
to
make
objections
and
bring
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
so--
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
--i
would
say
in
this
particular
case,
counsel
was
not...
the
trial
court
refused
to
instruct
counsel
not
to
make
any
objections.
now,
the
record
reflects
that
the
trial
court,
towards...
after
the
proceedings
had
begun,
the
trial
court
began
to,
if
counsel
made
an
objection,
to
say
are
you
acting
with
mr.
wiggins'
permission
or
do
you
have
the
permission?
we
have
some
ground
rules
here,
the
court
said.
you
have
to
have
his
permission
before
you
can
say
anything.
the
court,
the
trial
court...
and
one
of
the
bases
of
the
complaint
of
the
respondent
is
that
the
trial
court
refused
to
issue
a
broad
instruction
telling
standby
counsel
that
he
was
not
to
speak
up,
that
basically,
that
he
must
be
seen
and
not
heard.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
i
think
that
ideally
the
court,
perhaps
at
an
earlier
point
in
the
trial,
could
have
advised
counsel
that
he
would
not
be
heard--
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
--i
believe
that
an
appropriate
way
for
the
trial
court
to
proceed,
and
one
that
i
believe
would
clearly
be
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
faretta,
would
be
for
the
trial
court
to
advise
counsel
that
he
was
not
to
speak
up
on
the
defendant's
behalf
unless
either
he
had
the
permission
of
the
defendant
or
there
were
some
very
serious
matter
which
threatened
to
undermine
the
validity
of
the
proceedings
or
he
perceived
sore
grave
error
occurring.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that?
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
the
judge...
the
judge
finally
through...
after
the
proceedings
had
begun--
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
--he
didn't
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
i
think
that
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
trial
court
is
printed
in
the
very
first
portion
of
the
joint
appendix
and
reflects
that
clearly
the
judge
understood
that
mr.
wiggins
was
exercising
his
faretta
right,
and
he
advised
the
defendant
that...
he
advised
counsel
that
counsel
was
present
in
an
advisory
capacity.
but
he
refused,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
judge
under
these
circumstances
should
be
constitutionally
required
to
advise
standby
counsel
not
to
speak
up.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
that
was...
the
portion
of
the
record
to
which
you
refer
was
a
proceeding,
a
motion
hearing
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
counsel
at
that
point
was
explaining
to
the
respondent
who
was
attempting
to
begin
his
examination
prior
to
his
turn,
was
explaining
to
him
that
it
would
be
his
turn
later
for
him
to
examine
or
cross
examine.
i
believe--
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
--i
believe
that
the
trial
court
in
the
instant
case
illustrated
a
very
clear
understanding
of
who
was
in
control
at
this
trial
as
the
trial
court
begin
to
inquire
specifically,
if
counsel
made
an
objection,
specifically
began
to
inquire
whether
or
not
counsel
had
the
permission
of
the
respondent.
at
the
guilt
or
innocence
jury
argument
stage,
the
court
inquired
of
the
procedure.
counsel
stated
that
he
was
going
to
argue.
the
trial
court
said
do
you
have
mr.
wiggins'
permission
to
argue,
and
mr.
wiggins'
said
yes.
so
the
trial
court
i
believe
did
illustrate
an
understanding
of
who
was
in
control
and
several
times
specifically
said,
now,
counsel,
we
have
some
rules
here.
mr.
wiggins
is
representing
himself.
it
is
going
to
be
his
decision,
and
in
fact,
sustained
the
position
of
the
respondent
every
single
time
a
disagreement
occurred.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
yes,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
--and
that
is
part
of
what
standby
counsel
did
in
the
instant
case.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
counsel
also
made
objections
to
things
that
the
prosecutor
had
done
such
as
leading
the
witness
or
introducing
hearsay
evidence.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
pardon
me?
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
no,
your
honor.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
no,
your
honor,
certainly
not
the
language,
and
we
have
never...
we
have
never
contended
that.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
approximately.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that's
all.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
i
believe
that
that's
correct,
that
the
portions...
the
portions
not
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
are
portions
of
examination,
cross
examination
of
witnesses,
but
i
believe
that
virtually
every
instance
where
counsel
spoke
on
the
record
is
reflected
in
the
joint
appendix.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
thank
you.
ms.
leslie
a.
benitez
your
honor,
i
believe
that
we
have
presented
our
argument.
so
if
the
court
has
no
additional
questions,
we
have
nothing
further.
