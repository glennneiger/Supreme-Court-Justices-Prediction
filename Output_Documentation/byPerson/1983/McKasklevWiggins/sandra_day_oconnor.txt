justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smyser,
that
illustrates
a
point
that
i
haven't
heard
you
discuss,
and
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
public
interest
in
having
a
fair
trial
should...
is
sufficiently
great
that
maybe
the
participation
of
counsel,
even
when
the
accused
doesn't
want
it,
is
appropriate
to
vindicate
the
public
interest
in
having
a
fair
proceeding
and
preventing
making
a
mockery
of
the
judicial
system,
and
i
think
your
view
is
a
little
simplistic
to
ignore
that
public
interest.
