unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
then,
mr.
patterson,
that
the
tenth
circuit
went
beyond
requiring
the
juror
to
in
good
faith
answer
the
question
as
he
understood
it?
unknown
speaker
does
that
theory
in
any
way
allow
the
counsel
not
to
be
diligent
in
his
questions?
unknown
speaker
does
it
also
allow
him
not
to
ask
questions?
unknown
speaker
does
the
duty
of
counsel
recognize
the
duty
to
probe
properly?
unknown
speaker
and
not
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
is
the
duty
of
the
counsel.
unknown
speaker
and,
now
at
any
time...
is
it
your
position
that
counsel
in
this
case
could
have
asked
a
question
which
would
have
brought
out
this
information?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
kind
of
an
answer
that
the
average
juror
would
have
given.
unknown
speaker
and
an
average
juror
would
have
understood
that
he
should
have
revealed
the
information
that
the
didn't
reveal.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
just
for
a
minute,
may
we
return
to
the
conversation,
the
post-trial
conversation
between
counsel?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
did
not
participate
in
that,
did
he?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
heard
the
telephone
conversation
between
counsel?
unknown
speaker
i
was
interested
in
the
conversation
between
the
two
counsel
after
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
the
judge
was
not
a
party
to
that
conversation?
unknown
speaker
but,
is
there
any
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
transpired
in
that
conference?
unknown
speaker
can
we
accept
what
the
tenth
circuit
said
about
the
substance
of
the
conversation?
unknown
speaker
can
we
accept
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
right
there--
unknown
speaker
--i
was
puzzled
about
the
extent
to
which
that
conversation
was
reported
to
the
district
judge.
unknown
speaker
not
even
on
the
subsequent
motion
for
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
information
about
that
conversation
that
was
made
known
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
dispositive,
which
had
not
been
made
known
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
in
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you
object
to
the
fact
that
you
were
then
arguing
about
the
significance
of
a
conversation
that
had
not
been
disclosed
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
this
because
i
have
missed
something
here.
you
say
the
rule
in
your
district
is
there
can't
be
any
interrogation
of
jurors.
did
the
court
consent
to
it
here?
unknown
speaker
nothing
said
about
recording
the
call?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
what
you
said
earlier.
nothing
turns
on
what
was
said
in
that
conversation.
unknown
speaker
something
does?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
no
dispute
between
you
about
what
was
said
in
the
sense
that--
unknown
speaker
--we
can
rely
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
said.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
didn't
the
district
court
decide
that
the
trial
had
been
fair
and
wasn't
that
decision
made
after
this
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
juror
should
have
disqualified
himself?
unknown
speaker
you
lost
me
there.
let's
get
our
time
straight.
they
filed
a
motion
for
new
trial
on
approximately
the
same
day
of
this
telephone
conversation.
unknown
speaker
and
the
motion
for
new
trial
made
no
mention
of
the
telephone
conversation.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you,
suppose
the
juror
had
answered
the
question
in
a
way
that
revealed
the
information
that
was
later
brought
out
about
the
accident
to
his
son.
unknown
speaker
would
there
have
been
any
basis
for
challenging
the
juror
for
cause?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
counsel
would
have
asked
the
judge
to
excuse...
might
have
asked
the
judge
to
excuse
him
for
cause.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
evidence
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether...
if
the
answer
had
been
the
full
answer
and
included
the
information
that
was
later
brought
out,
was
there
any
evidence
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
or
not
counsel
would
have
exercised
the
peremptory
challenge?
unknown
speaker
and
he
did
not
challenge?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
all
there
is.
certainly
there
couldn't
have
been
any...
there
wasn't
any
hearing
as
to
whether
he
would
or
would
not
have
exercised--
unknown
speaker
--but,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
he
should
have
had
the
information
so
as
to
make
up
his
mind
about
using
his
peremptory
challenge?
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
what
they
are
saying
about
the
prejudice,
but
how
would
they
conclusively
presume
bias?
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
if
the
situation
were
such
that
the
information
the
juror
failed
to
disclose
was
information
that
clearly,
under
anyone's
view,
would
have
constituted
grounds
for
a
challenge
for
cause
of
that
juror,
would
you
feel
that
a
new
trial
would
have
to
be
granted?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
it
was.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what
if
it
wasn't
called
for,
but
clearly
the
information
would
have
given
grounds
to
challenge
for
cause.
you
would
say
no
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
say
that
would
be
waived?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
information
might
have...
let's
assume
the
information
would
have
been
clearly
grounds
for
challenge
for
cause,
but
the
juror
didn't
answer
and
give
that
information.
i
suppose
he
might
honestly
have
thought
that
the
question
didn't
call
for
that
information
and
which
everybody
agrees
in
this
case
was
the
case.
but,
nevertheless,
an
average
juror
objectively
would
have
given
the
answers.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
let's
assume
that
anybody
in
his
right
mind
would
have
given
the
full
answer,
but,
nevertheless,
this
particular
person
honestly
didn't
give
it.
he
was
honest.
he
wasn't
engaged
in
misconduct,
it
is
just
that
he
didn't
reveal
this
information,
although
the
average
juror
would
have.
would
you
then
say
a
new
trial
was--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
have
challenged
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
sent
the
case
back
for
a
hearing
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
prejudice
or
bias?
unknown
speaker
so
you
wouldn't
say
the
fact
that
the
juror
was
honest
necessarily
precluded
the
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
a
peremptory
challenge
would
have
been
exercised
or
not
or
whether
there
was
actual
bias
by
the
juror?
unknown
speaker
what
would
have
been
the
scope
of
the
hearing
if
there
had
been
such
a
remand
with
respect
to
bias?
would
they
actually
get
into
what
went
on
in
the
jury
room?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would
have
to
just
decide...
could
you
have
called
him
to
the
stand?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would--
unknown
speaker
--so,
it
would
have
had
to
be
sort
of
an
inferential
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
inquiry
would
be
confined
to
the
inquiry
that
could
have
been
made
at
the
trial,
at
the
selection
of
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
in
your
research,
have
you
come
across
any
case
close
to
this
one?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
extending
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
said.
is
there
one
like
this?
unknown
speaker
we
would
just
be
putting
out
a
rule
based
on
a
case
that
is
unique
in
its
own
facts.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but,
you
seem
to
agree
or
wouldn't
have
objected
to
a
remand
rather
than
an
order
for
a
new
trial.
and,
suppose
that
at
that
hearing,
which
you
seem
to
think
could
be
based
on
the
fact
that
this
juror,
although
he
was
honest,
didn't
give
this
information
on
voir
dire,
suppose
at
the
hearing
the
district
judge
determined,
based
on
all
the
evidence,
that
counsel
would
have
exercised
a
peremptory
challenge
to
exclude
this
juror?
unknown
speaker
then
it
would
be
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
because
of
an
interference
with
peremptory
challenge?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
that
is
why
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
know.
well,
you
should
object...
you
should
say
you
would
be
here
making
the
same
kind
of
an
argument
if
there
had
been
a
remand
for
a
hearing
rather
than
an
order
for
a
new
trial.
unknown
speaker
the
appellee
used
up
all
of
his
challenges,
peremptories?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
good
would
that
do
here?
i
understood
you
to
say
he
would
have
exercised
his
peremptory.
what
peremptory?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
have
any.
unknown
speaker
that
is
really
going.
unknown
speaker
to
what
extent
is
there
a
questionnaire
available
to
counsel
throughout
the
numbers
of
the
array
of
prospective
jurors?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
am
speaking
of
a
written
questionnaire.
is
that
in
vogue
in
your
parts?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
question
in
there
about
accidents
of
people
in
your
own
family?
unknown
speaker
there
are
questionnaires
which
reach
all
of
those
points
though.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
is
it
your...
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
if
a
juror
intentionally
refuses
to
disclose
information
that
is
directly
asked
on
voir
dire
that
there
should
be
a
new
trial
granted?
unknown
speaker
yes.
let
us
assume
an
intentional
refusal
to
disclose
information
that
is
asked.
now,
does
that
automatically
result
in
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
what
would
determine
it
then?
unknown
speaker
okay.
so,
juror
misconduct
then
is
not
really
a
factor
here.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that
you
would
have
us
focus
on
is
the
probable
bias.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
ultimate
number
of
the
jury
you
end--
unknown
speaker
--six.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
mr.
schroer,
do
you
mean
non-false
information
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
person
answering
or
kind
of
objectively
truthful?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
general
question
has
any
bearing
on
the
point
you
are
making
now?
unknown
speaker
if
the
man
gave
an
affirmative
response
that
he
could
be
fair
or
was
silent,
would
not
everyone
in
the
courtroom
have
a
right
to
assume
that
he
was
stating
he
could
be
fair?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
far
does
that
go?
for
instance,
suppose
you
had
a
juror
who
simply
didn't
want
to
tell
his
or
her
true
age
and
lied
about
it
on
voir
dire.
are
we
going
to
give
you
a
new
trial
because
you
didn't
know
how
old
that
juror
was?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
before
you
proceed,
there
were
other
defendants,
weren't
there,
in
addition
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--none
whatever?
unknown
speaker
the
$350,000
in
damages
was
assessed
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
was
she
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
it
the
neighbor--
unknown
speaker
--wasn't
the
neighbor
a
phantom
defendant?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
brought
in
what,
$350,000
damages
and--
unknown
speaker
--my
question
is
how
could
there
have
been
bias
if
the
jury
found
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
bicycle
and
then
found
negligence
on
the
part
of
other
people
and
assessed
damages?
unknown
speaker
none
whatever?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
had
been
two
manufacturers?
unknown
speaker
suppose
there
had
been
two
manufacturers?
somebody
had
manufactured
parts
and
somebody
else
had
manufactured
other
parts.
unknown
speaker
your
question
was
serious
injury
not
just
injury.
wasn't
that
your
question
on
voir
dire?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
really
don't
know,
do
you,
unless
you
investigate
all
the
jurors
after
their
answers?
you
know
that
some
respond.
you
are
not
sure
the
ones
not
responding
may
not
have
had
similar
experiences.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schroer,
how
long
did
this
trial
last,
do
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
supposing
it
was,
instead
of
eight
trial
days,
it
would
have
been
eight
trial
months,
eight
trial
months
the
trial
had
gone
on,
would
you
still
say
that
an
error
like
this
described
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
require
a
new
trial
and
the
reassembling
of
all
the
judicial
machinery
to
take
another
eight
months?
unknown
speaker
surely
no
right
is
absolute.
i
mean,
there
must
be
an
interest
in
the
finality
of
jury
verdicts
to
a
certain
extent.
unknown
speaker
isn't
an
order
for
a
new
trial
though
a
rather
severe
remedy
for
whatever
happened
here?
it
is
just
an
assumption
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
your
peremptory
challenge
right
was
substantially
interfered
with.
shouldn't
there
have
been
a
hearing
on
it
before
a
district
court?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
the
contents
of
this
telephone
conversation
with
the
juror
never
came
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
told
the
trial
judge
to
hold
a
hearing
rather
than
order
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
dissent
but
how
about
the
majority?
the
majority
ordered
a
new
trial
and
i
suppose
you
are
here...
are
you
here
defending
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
when
did
you
tell
the
district
judge
about
this
telephone
conversation
in
relation
to
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
that
contained
the
information
that
you
had
found--
--that
was
not
my
question.
unknown
speaker
did
you
ask
the
trial
judge
for
that?
unknown
speaker
that
does
not
say
about
the
telephone
conversation.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
you
tell
him
about
the
telephone
conversation?
why,
w-h-y?
unknown
speaker
weren't
you
just
a
guilty
of
withholding
information
from
the
judge
as
you
allege
the
juror
was
withholding
information
from
you?
unknown
speaker
counsel--
unknown
speaker
--counsel,
before
you
proceed,
let's
assume
that
when
you
had
this
conversation
with
the
juror
who
had
remained
silent
he
said,
yes,
i
did
have
a
son
who
had
an
accident
that
hurt
his
leg
rather
badly
and
we
did
bring
suit
and
we
won
a
$500,000
judgment,
but
i
thought
this
was
just
information
that
might
prejudice
one
side
or
the
other
so
i
kept
quiet.
what
would
your
position
be?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
i
am
assuming
you
lost
the
case.
what
is
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
you
would
still
be
here
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
assuming
you
lost
all
the
way
around.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have?
if
the
tenth
circuit
says
you
have
a
right
to
know,
would
the
tenth
circuit
have
reversed
the
case?
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
have
been
prejudiced
if
the
juror
had
withheld
the
information
that
his
son
had
recovered
$500,000?
unknown
speaker
that
kind
of
prejudice
is
immaterial,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
supposing
you
had
gotten
the
judgment
and
precisely
the
same
information
was
developed
that
has
been
developed
here;
namely,
the
foreman
didn't
disclose
the
injury
to
his
son.
would
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial
on
these
facts?
unknown
speaker
either
side
could
have
set
aside
a
verdict
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
one
other
mechanical
question
if
i
may.
there
were
12
people
who
were
interrogated
on
the
voir
dire,
12
potential
jurors?
unknown
speaker
and,
six
were
excused
on
the
peremptory,
each
using
three
peremptories.
no
one
used
any
challenges
for
cause,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
those
12
were
the
only
12
that
were
ever
asked
this
question.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question
about
the
facts
here.
where
can
we
find
out
how
serious
this
boy's
injury
was?
i
know
it
was
a
broken
leg
and
it
was
the
result
of
a
tire
exploding.
what
more
do
we
know
about
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us.
unknown
speaker
what
is
now
in
writing
that
we
could
look
at
other
than
asking
your
personal
recollection
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--by
saying
in
the
record,
do
you
mean
in
the
briefs?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
you
say
that
should
have
been
enough
for
the
trial
judge.
did
you
have
an
oral
argument
on
the
motion
for
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
and
you
never
submitted
in
writing
to
him
what
you
thought
should
have
been
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
never
told
him
anything
about
the
telephone
conversation.
you
didn't
have
an
oral
argument
so
you
didn't
tell
him
orally
and
you
didn't
file
anything
in
writing
other
than
what
has
already
been
called
to
our
attention.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
you
had
been
remiss
at
all.
unknown
speaker
and
they
gave
you
relief.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
think
you
had
passed
up
any
opportunity
you
had
in
the
trial
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
schroer,
you
are
not
indicating
or
contending,
i
guess,
that
the
information
disclosed
here
would
have
entitled
that
the
juror
be
excused
for
cause,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
you
know
it
or
not,
we
know
now.
you
are
not
contending
that
that
is
sufficient
to
have
the
juror
excused
for
cause,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
you
could
have
asked
questions
like
that
of
all
the
jurors
as
you
went
along
and
you
probably
typically
do,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
about
your
attitudes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
some
of
that
is
present
in
every
jury
selection
in
america.
there
are
things
that
some
jurors
disclose
and
some
that
others
do
not,
and
if
one
does,
you
are
likely
to
follow
up,
and
if
one
doesn't,
you
don't.
and,
you
have
to
be
very
careful
in
fashioning
the
rule
for
a
new
trial
that
you
don't
go
too
far
in
presuming
things.
you
might
be
wearing
the
other
shoe
at
the
next
trial
and
be
resisting
this
very
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
what
is
important
is
whether
it
indicates
a
probable
bias.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
test,
whether
the
responses
would
indicate
a
probable
bias?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but,
you
would
agree
that
the
information
that
isn't
disclosed
should
at
least
be
something
that
would
indicate
probable
bias?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schroer,
how
many
peremptories
do
you
have
in
kansas?
unknown
speaker
on
page
64
of
the
joint
appendix,
there
seems
to
be
eight
strikes.
who
are
the
other
two?
unknown
speaker
but,
it
doesn't
show
who
exercised--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
it
doesn't
show
who
struck
max
frauenfelder
or
albert
elser.
it
probably
is
of
no
significance.
unknown
speaker
do
you
just
have
the
sheet
and
pass
it
back
and
forth?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
this
case
was
a
freak.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
this
case
was
a
freak.
unknown
speaker
now
kansas
is
normal.
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
saying
it
is
usual.
unknown
speaker
now
you
are
saying
it
is
a
very
good
thing
in
kansas,
it
works
beautifully.
unknown
speaker
was
the
record
in
this
case
opened
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
was
the
record
opened
and
this
material
put
in
it?
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
it
got
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
the
telephone
conversation,
etcetera.
unknown
speaker
i
said
where
was
it
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
how
in
the
world
can
we
pass
on
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
stipulate
a
record,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
and,
where...
do
you
want
us
to
make
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
record
here.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
do
it
other
than
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
schroer,
how
did...
did
you
say
how
the
$375,000
award
was
assessed?
against
whom?
unknown
speaker
by
name.
unknown
speaker
and,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
about
that
allocation?
unknown
speaker
and,
again
if
there
is
an
award,
it
may
be
allocated
the
same
way
if
the
jury
wants
to,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
35,
15,
45.
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
mcdonough
may
be,
in
the
new
trial,
assessed
that.
unknown
speaker
who
is
your
client
or
is
that--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but,
counsel,
can
we
be
entirely
sure...
everybody
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
the
decision
it
was
a
good
faith,
honest
answer.
but,
is
it
not
possible
that
a
hearing
would
disclose
that
the
juror,
in
fact,
was
less
than
candid?
i
have
to
confess
that
i
would
have
thought
most
people
would
have
answered
this
question
differently.
unknown
speaker
it
interests
me
that
judge
barrett's
position
was
that
the
case
should
have
gone
back
and
you
should
have
had
a
hearing
to
find
out
a
little
bit
more
about
the
facts.
we
are
all
kind
of
troubled
by
our
inability
to
know
exactly
what
they
were.
unknown
speaker
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
the
juror's
son
had
a
permanent
injury
as
a
result
of
the
tire
explosion?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
was
out
for
six
months?
he
had
to
miss
six
months
of
school.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
is
we
don't
know
exactly
what
the
facts
are.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering...
i
am
sorry
to
take
so
much
of
your
rebuttal
time,
but
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
soundness
of
judge
barrett's
position?
do
you
think
judge
barrett
was
right
or
wrong?
