mr.
donald
r.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
mandate
of
the
tenth
circuit
which
ordered
a
new
trial
in
a
product
liability
personal
injury
suit
in
which
the
verdict
and
the
resultant
judgment
were
for
the
defendant.
at
the
trial
level
fault
was
allocated
to
non-parties
under
a
procedure
that
is
governed
by
kansas
law
and
fashioned
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
there
already
was
quite
a
tight
merger
between
federal
rules
of
procedures
and
the
substantive
law
of
kansas.
a
special
verdict
was
returned
in
order
to
accommodate
that
situation.
there
was
a
finding
in
which
damages
were
also
found
under
the
procedure.
the
ground
for
a
new
trial
was
what
the
tenth
circuit
described.
it
was
an
impairment
to
the
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
in
order
to
focus
upon
the
precise
issue,
i
believe
it
can
best
be
accomplished
by
describing
very
briefly
what
the
case
is
not.
it
is
not
a
case
of
juror
misconduct.
the
tenth
circuit
found
the
juror,
in
responding
to
the
voir
dire
questions,
was
honest
and
in
good
faith.
it
is
not
a
question
of
juror
qualification
or
the
lack
of
the
statutory
qualifications.
there
was
not
a
denial
of
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
actual
bias
existed.
no
hearing
was
granted,
no
hearing
was
requested
after
the
court
permitted
an
interview
with
the
juror
by
both
counsel
simultaneously
over
the
telephone.
subsequent
to
that
interview,
there
was
no
hearing
requested.
there
was
no
trial
error
that
was
identified.
we
have
the
unusual
situation,
as
was
described
in
the
brief,
of
a
wrong
without
a
wrong-doer.
it
was
not
a
case
of
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge
itself.
each
side
was
given
three.
it
was
a
two-party
case.
the
contention
and
the
ruling
of
the
circuit
was
that
a
peremptory
challenge
was
impaired
due
to
the
lack
of
a
level
of
information
which
counsel
had
at
the
time
the
peremptory
challenge
had
to
be
exercised.
in
order
to
focus
upon
that,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
subdivide
and
identify
three
more
separate
issues
which
are
really
the
substance
of
my
argument.
the
first
is
what
i
have
denominated
the
right-to-know
argument.
is
there
or
should
there
be
a
level
of
information
to
which
counsel
are
entitled
that
is
over
and
above
that
which
is
provided
by
good
faith,
honest
answers
to
proper
voir
dire
questions?
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
there
was
that
level
of
information.
it
was
described
by
the
tenth
circuit
as
that
level
of
information
that
would
be
provided
by
the
"average"
juror.
that
is
the
only
description
we
have.
that
is
the
only
description
of
the
standard
that
we
must
meet.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir,
that
is
precisely
the
point.
secondly--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--does
not
prohibit
counsel
from
asking
any
question,
your
honor,
on
a
voir
dire
examination.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
as
it
was
implemented
in
this
case,
no,
sir.
rule
47,
of
course,
gives
the
court
leeway
either
way.
the
court
can
ask
all
questions
on
voir
dire.
he
can
permit
counsel
to
ask
questions
on
voir
dire
or
there
can
be
a
combination
of
both.
in
this
case
both
was
done.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
our
contention
is
that
that
is
the
responsibility
of
counsel.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
am
sorry,
sir?
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
suggest
that
it
is,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
it
could
have
been
done.
it
could
have
been
responded
to
in
the
answers
to
the
questions
that
were
asked.
our
position
is
that
the
fact
that
it
does
not
and
did
not
does
not
show
dishonesty
on
the
part
of
the
juror
and
neither
does
it
show
a
lack
of
good
faith
and
the
tenth
circuit
observed
that.
what
the
tenth
circuit
did
rule
was
that
counsel
was
entitled
to
a
level
of
information
beyond
good
faith,
honest
answers.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
the
standard
that
we
seek
to
challenge.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
that
was
granted.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
happened
in
this
sequence,
your
honor.
early...
after
the
trial,
there
was
a
motion
filed
for
leave
to
approach
juror.
we
have
a
blanket
rule
in
the
district,
following
the
trial
of
the
kirkwood
or
the
silkwood/kerr-mcgee
case
which
absolutely
prohibits
counsel
from
interrogating
any
juror
after
a
trial
without
the
court's
permission.
no
juror
contact
was
made.
application
was
made
by
plaintiff's
counsel
and
initially
it
was
denied.
soon
thereafter
a
second
application
was
made
in
which
there
was
an
accompanying
affidavit
of
the
father
of
the
plaintiff.
plaintiff
was
a
three-year
old
child.
the
father
was
a
navy
recruiter.
he
could
recall
the
name
of
a
person
in
olpe,
kansas,
which
i
should
explain
is
a
rather
small
community
in
kansas
of
about
300,
who
had
the
same
surname
as
did
the
foreman
of
the
jury.
it
happened
that
there
was
an
18-year
old
boy
who
had
received
an
injury,
a
broken
leg,
in
the
course
of
inflating
a
tire.
we
don't
know
much
about
the
mechanics
of
the
injury,
how
it
happened,
what
it
involved,
or
the
seriousness
of
the
injury.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
thereafter,
the
court
sustained
counsel's
motion,
granted
permission
to
have
the
telephone
interview
occur.
it
did,
in
fact,
occur.
it
was
off
the
record.
no
record--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--no,
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
would
say
we
agreed
on
about
70
percent
of
it.
in
counsel's
brief
before
the
tenth
circuit
he
placed
what
he
recalled
and
i
placed
what
i
recalled
and--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--the
tenth
circuit
said
that
they
gave
full
credence
to
both
versions.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
believe
so.
i
am
not
going
to
object
to
what
was
said
by
counsel
in
his
brief
in
the
tenth
circuit.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
was
never
reported
to
the
district
judge,
that
is
the
point.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
the
reason
for
my
initial
comment
that
this
was
a
trial
without
error.
that
is
true.
the
conversation
was
never
reported
to
the
trial
court.
he
never
ruled
on
it.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
was
both
orally
and
in
the
briefs.
and,
it
was
something
that
occurred
entirely
off
the
record.
i
am
going
to
get
back
to
that
and
a
point
further
down
in
my
argument
which
raises
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
presumed
prejudice.
that
point
is
the
evidence,
i
believe,
of
the
absence
of
prejudice;
that
fact
that
it
was
not
reported
to
the
trial
court
so
that
the
trial
court
could
then
schedule
a
hearing
to
determine
actual
bias.
it
was
not
done.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
yes.
the
rule
provides,
your
honor,
that
there
cannot
be
any
contact
of
jurors
post
trial
without
the
permission
of
the
court.
it
was
initially
denied.
later
it
was
granted
but
limited
to
one
juror
who
was
identified,
juror
payton.
he
happened
to
be
the
foreman.
the
court
outlined
the
method
by
which
it
was
to
be
done
and
said
it
could
be
done,
but
both
counsel
had
to
be
present
and
it
could
be
done
by
means
of
a
conference
telephone
call,
which
it
was.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
sir,
nothing
was
said
in
the
order
and
unfortunately
it
was
not
done.
but--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
i
think
it
does
turn,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
i
think
something
does
turn.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
right.
i
believe
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
about
what
was
said.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
in
the
sequence
of
events,
that
is
what
occurred.
the
motion
for
new
trial,
if
i
recall
correctly,
and
i
could
be
off
a
day
or
two,
but
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
actually
filed,
i
believe,
on
the
same
day
that
the
telephone
conversation
occurred.
impairment
of
a
peremptory
challenge
was
not
one
of
the
grounds
for
new
trial
urged.
ground
no.
18
comes
close
to
it
and
the
error
identified
there
was
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
permit
inquiry
among
jurors
to
determine
whether
or
not
juror
misconduct
had
occurred.
that,
the
tenth
circuit
said,
was
broad
enough
to
include
the
ground
upon
which
a
new
trial
was
granted
by
the
tenth
circuit,
the
denial
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
true.
it
is
printed
in
the
appendix.
and,
the
order--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
doubt
it.
that
is
really--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--it
might
have
occurred
but
that
is
a
judgment
call
of
the
trial
court.
i
really
couldn't
presume
to
answer
that
question,
because,
you
see,
it
would
be
a
matter
of
challenge
for
cause
and
under
the
rules
that
is
determined
by
the
trial
judge
alone.
it
might
be
requested.
that
is
judgment
call
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
believe
there
was,
your
honor,
because
two
other
jurors
revealed
similar
type
information.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
they
were
not
challenged.
they
both
sat.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
sir,
there
was
none.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
the
court
of
appeals
in
one
sentence
held
that
bias
as
well
as
prejudice
were
conclusively
presumed.
the
sentence
was
to
the
effect
that
if
the
undisclosed
information
is
of
sufficient
cogency
to
cause
us
to
believe
counsel
was
entitled
to
know
of
it
when
peremptory
challenge
was
exercised.
that,
you
see,
in
one
sentence
conclusively
presumes
bias,
conclusively
presumes
prejudice
so
as
to
remove
the
case
from
the
harmless
error
rule
identified
in--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--how
they
did
it
and
why
i
cannot
answer.
they
appeared
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
it
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
information...
i
would
suppose
whether
or
not
the
information
was
called
for
in
the
voir
dire
question
that
was
asked.
clearly--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--if
it
was,
then
it
would
be
a
case
of
misconduct.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
misconduct.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
that
again,
i
think,
would
fall
into
the
category
of
information
that
might
have
been
obtainable
had
a
question
been
asked
but
was
not
otherwise
obtained
for
the
failure
to
ask
the
question.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
would
be
waived.
that
would
be
counsel's
responsibility,
not
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
juror
or
any
mistake
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
the
rule
that
the
tenth
circuit
announced.
that
is
the
rule
that
we
seek
to
challenge
here,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
i
would
say
then
that
the
court
was
adding
to
the
qualifications
of
jurors
beyond
that
which
congress
authorized
in
28
u.s.c.
1865(b)(2).
you
see,
you
are
announcing
a
standard.
you
are
announcing
a
required
level
of
performance
of
a
juror
which
might
be
beyond
and
might
require
a
comprehension
and
skill
in
the
use
of
comprehending
the
english
language
in
the
first
place,
recalling
events
rapidly
in
the
scene
of
a
courtroom,
because
these
questions
very
often
have
no
time
limits
to
them,
recalling
all
of
the
events
that
passed
through
the
bulk
of
their
life,
and,
thirdly,
an
ability
to
accurately
relate
that
information.
that
involves
some
skills
in
the
use
of
the
english
language.
now,
the
only
statutory
requirement
is
that
he
has
to
be
sufficiently
skilled
to
fill
out
the
jury
form.
we
suggest
this,
that
questions
asked
on
voir
dire
are
bound
to
be
understood
differently
as
long
as
you
have
jurors
that
come
from
all
walks
of
society
and
that,
indeed,
is
the
policy.
it
is
mandated
by
statute
and
probably
by
decisions
that
preceded
the
statute,
28
u.s.c.
1861
through
65.
you
have
a
cross
section
of
the
community.
you
have
all
ages,
all
occupational
groups,
all
social
and
economic
status
groups,
both
sexes,
all
races.
we
suggest
that
that
diverse
group
will
not
comprehend
all
questions
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
very--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--very
likely
not.
we
would
have
held
the
hearing
and
gone
from
there.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
would
have
been
concerned
about
it,
your
honor,
but
i
would
have
doubted
in
my
own
mind
whether
the
case
in
that
posture
would
have
been
the
proper
vehicle
to
present
the
question
here
that
we
are
presenting
now.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
hopefully
not,
because
that
is
absolutely
prohibited
by
rule
606.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
prior
events
that
he
was
inquired
about
had
such
an
impact
upon
his
attitude
and
his
thinking
that
he
had
already
prejudged
this
type
of
case.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
more
than
likely.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
but,
avoid
anything
that
went
on
in
the
jury
room
or
the
impact
of
any
bit
of
information
might
have
had
on--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--it
would
have
to
be.
we
know
of
no
other
way.
it
was--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
the
inquiry
would
be
limited
to
whether
or
not
he
had
a
state
of
mind
that
might
have
come
close
to
prejudging
the
issues
prior
to
the
time
he
heard
any
evidence
on
it.
that
would
be
it.
that
is
what
i
understand
by
the
term
"actual
bias".
certainly
it
could
not
involve
anything
that
went
on
in
the
jury
room.
that
is
prohibited.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
have
attempted
to...
the
problem
has
come
up,
your
honor,
and
it
has
come
up
in
most
of
the
circuits.
we
find
that--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--circuits
have
held
that
this
is
not
a
ground
for
a
new
trial
unless
there
is
either
juror
misconduct
or
a
finding
of
actual
bias
and
a
finding
of
actual
prejudice.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
have
found
none,
your
honor,
that
does
this,
nor
have
we
found
any
that
sets
up
a
standard
which
required
a
standard
of
the
"average"
juror
which
requires
a
minimum
standard--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
facts
are
unique.
it
is
really
quite
typical.
i
think
the
rule
of
the
tenth
circuit
is
what
is
unique.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
a
finding
of
prejudice
and
we
would
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
certainly.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
think...
let
me
identify
the
steps
of
our
analysis
first.
i
do
not
think
that
we
get
into
this
problem
of
a
hearing
on
actual
bias
or
actual
prejudice
until
you
first
make
this
initial
concession
that
there
is
a
level
of
performance
that
the
court
can
require.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
object
to
that.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
probably
would
have
gone
that
route
rather
than
raising
the
question
with
a
case
in
that
posture
as
being
the
vehicle
to
raise
this
question.
but,
we
are
not
in
that
posture.
we
do
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
that
kind
of
a
requirement.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
parties
used
all
three
challenges.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
all
three
challenges
were
used.
the
contention,
your
honor,
is
that
he
used...
he
was
required
to
use
his
peremptory
challenges
at
a
time
when
he
lacked
information
to
which
he
was
entitled.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
our
question
is
or
our
contention
is
that
he
is
entitled
to
that
information
that
is
provided
by
honest,
good
faith
answers
of
voir
direment,
but
nothing
more
and
nothing
more
should
be
required.
that
is
about
all
you
can
ask.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
the
court...
if
i
recall
the
events
properly,
the
court
asked
some
very
general
questions
initially.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
it
is.
and,
there
was
no
question
raised
by
either
side
about
the
ability
or
lack
of
ability--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
believe
not.
i
believe
not,
because
not
every
case
is
a
damage
case.
they
come
there
to
hear
criminal
cases,
damage
suits,
anything
that
they
have
before
them.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
haven't
looked
at
it
for
three
and
a
half
years
and
honestly
don't
recall.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
really
involves
a
question
of
misconduct.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
not
automatically,
no,
ma'am.
i
think
you
have
the--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--the
additional
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
actual
bias
and
actual
prejudice.
you
see,
otherwise--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--not
per
se.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
probable
bias
and
also
prejudice
in
order
to
get
away
and
satisfy
the
harmless
error
rule
which
is
announced
in
28
u.s.c.
2111
and
also
in
rule
61,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
misconduct
in
the
abstract
by
itself
really
doesn't
do
it
unless
in
order
to
satisfy
the
harmless
error
rule.
i
would
say
in
all
candor
that
the
fourth
circuit
did
in
one
case,
in
a
case
in
which
they
found
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
juror,
from
that
presumed
prejudice.
bias
was
not
considered.
so,
i
don't
know.
i
have
used
more
than
my
time
and
i
am
sorry.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
very
briefly,
your
honor.
i
have
a
fear
that
we
are
losing
perspective
on
how
these
various
issues
fit
together.
the
purpose
of
a
hearing,
i
believe,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
other
than
harmless
error
once
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
a
right
was
denied.
but,
the
underlying
problem
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
right
denied.
was
there
a
right
to
know
and
possess
information
above
that
which
was
provided
by
good
faith,
honest
answers
of
the
jurors.
that,
to
me,
is
the
fundamental
and
pivotal
question.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
suppose
that
would
have
to
be
a
question
that
would
be
answered
by
the
trial
court,
but
the
standard
would
be
misconduct.
now,
that
is
something
else.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
don't
know
as
it
would
be
prior
to
the
time
the
case
is
tried,
of
course.
the
standard
is
whether
or
not
there
is
cause,
challenge
for
cause.
that,
of
course,
is
a
judgment
call
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
judge
barrett's
decision
was
to
this
effect
as
i
comprehend
it.
there
was
a
denial
of
a
right,
but
was
it
anything
other...
was
it
prejudicial
or
was
it
bias?
send
it
back
for
a
hearing
to
determine
that.
our
position
here
is
all
three.
was
there
a
denial
of
a
right
and,
if
so,
is
it
necessary
to
resolve
the
question
of
the
consequence
of
that
denial
by
a
hearing
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
would
certainly
make
a
harder
case.
our
recollection...
we
have
very
little
information
about
it
as
counsel
stated.
i
will
confess
that--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
would
certainly
come
closer
to
a
case
of
juror
misconduct.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
right.
that
would
come
far
closer
to
a
case
of
juror
misconduct,
but,
you
see,
what
makes
this
such
a
dangerous
rule
is
that
the
tenth
circuit
acknowledged
he
was
honest
and
in
good
faith,
but
they
are
still
entitled
to
this
information
level
but
they
give
us
no
way
by
which
this
information
could
be
obtained.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
part
of
each.
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
denial
of
a
right
had
a
consequence
other
than
harmless
error
requiring
a
hearing,
yes,
he
is
right.
it
should
not
be
concluded
that
it
was
anything
other
than
harmless
error.
that
is
it
should
not
be
concluded
that
there
was
bias
or
that
there
was
prejudice
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing.
but,
on
the
initial
step
that
there
was
a
denial
of
a
level
of
information
to
which
he
was
entitled,
no,
we
disagree.
we
see
that
the
tenth
circuit
says
that
that
right
exists,
but
how
is
it
obtained?
they
are
silent
on
that.
if
we
were
to
try
the
case
again,
what
would
we
do
differently?
what
would
the
trial
judge
do
differently?
we
are
at
a
loss.
i
submit
that
we
would
have
to
do
it
exactly
the
same
way.
thank
you.
