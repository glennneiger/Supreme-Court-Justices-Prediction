mr.
gene
e.
schroer
may
it
please
the
court:
our
theory
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
is
involved
when
either
an
outside
person
or
a
person
in
the
jury,
after
the
jury
has
been
selected
and
heard
the
case,
as
distinguished
from
the
kinds
of
right
to
information
to
which
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
or
the
defendant
is
entitled
during
questions
to
voir
direment.
in
kansas,
we
selected
12
jurors
to
sit
in
a
panel,
an
array,
and
after
all
the
questions
were
over,
first
by
the
court
and
then
by
counsel,
we
each
exercised
three
peremptory
challenges.
it
wasn't
done
voir
direment
by
voir
direment.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
six.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
at
that
time.
so,
we
each,
by
putting
12
in
the
box,
there
were
six
remaining
after
three
peremptories
were
exercised.
we
don't
weigh
peremptories
in
kansas.
and,
the
court
asks
preliminary
questions,
general,
vague,
broad
questions
about
job,
employment,
where
you
work,
where
your
wife
works,
and
then
allows
counsel
to
conduct
independent
voir
dire.
the
whole
point
of
this
case...
we
believe
the
tenth
circuit
is
right
and
the
cases
that
preceded
our
case.
the
fact
that
it
is
a
meaningless
right
to
have
three
peremptories
if
lawyers
don't
get
truthful
information
from
jurors.
other
circuits--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--perhaps
i
should
have
said
full
and
complete
rather
than
suggesting
truthful
versus
untruthful.
this
is
a
case
where,
as
the
tenth
circuit
said,
any
reasonable
juror
would
have
responded.
there
were
some
five
or
six
other
questions
asked
by
counsel
for...
well,
first
by
the
judge
in
the
general
text,
can
you
be
fair,
would
you
be
a
fair
juror
if
you
were
representing
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
do
you
think
you
would
be
fair...
you
would
be
the
kind
of
juror
the
defendant
would
want
in
this
case.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
think
it
has
a
bearing
only
in
the
way
of
background,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
the
only
reason
i
raise
that
point.
i
agree,
your
honor.
the
only
reason
i
raise
that
point
is
because
counsel
seems
to
imply
that
we
have
to
show
a
mental
positive
bias
or
prejudice
on
the
part
of
that
juror
and
we
suggest
that
the
right
to
know,
such
as
in
the
swain
case
and
other
cases
by
this
court,
in
the
peremptory
setting
is
totally
different
from
misconduct
involved
after
a
jury
commences
to
deliberate
or
there
is
outside
influence
or
threatened.
the
right
to
know
full
and
complete
answers
is
important
subjectively
to
the
trial
lawyer
in
trying
to
decide
how
to
unselected
three
whom
he
might
think
would
be
the
three
worst
jurors
for
him.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
in
that
case,
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
is
de
minimus.
it
has
to
be
of
sufficient
cogency
and
substantially
affect.
see,
the
important
thing
about
this
case
to
us--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--no.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
no
other
defendants.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
well,
the
mother
of
the
little
boy
who
lost
both
of
his
feet.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
no.
but,
in
kansas,
we
have
a
unique
procedure
whereby
the
defendant
can
name
phantom
parties
and
blame
other
persons
not
parties
to
the
case.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
neighbor's
father
and
the
boy
driving
the
mower
as
well
as
the
little
boy's
mother
were
all
found
to
be
at
fault
by
the
jury
in
some
percentage.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
three
seventy-five,
i
believe,
but
that
was
after
the
jury
first
went
out
and
found
zero
and
the
court
sent
them
back
and
said
you
must
find
damages
and
they
came
back--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--because
in
kansas
there
is
no
joint
and
several
liability.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
none
whatever.
so,
therefore--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
in
kansas,
the
defendant
only
pays
his
percentage
share
that
is
found
against
him
or
it
and
nothing
else.
if
a
defendant
is
found
to
be
10
percent,
he
pays
10
percent
of
the
total
damages
award,
that
is
if
he
is
a
party.
if
he
is
found
to
have
20
percent
and
he
is
a
non-party,
he
still
pays
zero.
so,
doing
away
with
joint
and
several
under
kansas
substantive
law
has
had
a
great
effect
upon
these
cases.
but,
the
significance
is
that
this
juror,
had
he
answered,
yes,
i
have
had
a
son
who
was
injured
in
an
exploding
rim
case--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--serious
injury
causing
disability
or
prolonged
pain
or
suffering.
now,
this
becomes
more
important
in
response
to
chief
justice
burger's
question
because
other
questions
were
asked
by
the
court,
by
myself,
and
by
counsel
where
people
were
talked
about
their
sons
getting
their
finger
in
a
bike,
very
insignificant
kinds
of
questions,
because
in
my
experience
in
27
years,
you
will
find
jurors
fully
and
openly
resolve
all
doubts
about
answering
questions
in
favor
of
responding.
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
experience
as
a
lawyer
that
anybody
has
ever
withheld
something
in
the
general
area
where
other
jurors
are
responding.
a
lady
caught
her
finger
in
a
ringer
washer
15
years
before
or
20
years
before
the
man
married
her
and
another
minor
injury
to
a
child
13,
all
happening
many
years
before.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
see,
this
case
is
kind
of
a
freak
because
we
first...
we
first
filed
our
first
motion
to
ask
to
waive
the
rule
under
just
cause
and
say
we
have
got
just
cause
to
talk
to
these
jurors
under
the
weighting
of
the
kansas
rule.
because
one
jury
who
was
an
alternate
did
the...
had
the
audacity,
after
the
case
was
over,
to
run
to
the
judge,
talk
to
the
defense
lawyer,
and
come
to
the
plaintiff
leaving
the
courtroom,
saying
how
much
does
schroer
get
paid
for
contingent
fees
in
this
case?
how
did
he
solicit
this
case,
what
kind
of
plaintiff's
lawyer
is
he,
what
is
the
effect
upon
insurance?
so,
our
first
motion
was
directed
at
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
counsel
is
talking
about
where
the
first
juror
influenced
maybe.
and,
we
said,
that
is
just
cause,
judge,
let
us
talk
to
the
jury.
the
second
one
came
about
accidentally
and
coincidentally
because
the
plaintiff
was
a
recruiter
and
across
his
desk
comes
the
application
for
the
navy
from
the
son
of
the
jury
foreman
saying
that
he
had
been
injured
and
suffered
broken
bones
by
an
exploding
rim
while
working
in
a
truck
stop.
it
is
a
comparable
products
liability
case.
now,
the
point
as
far
as
plantiff's
voir
dire
is
concerned
is
that
information
would
have
been
important
to
me
to
ask
follow-up
questions
had
he
responded
truthfully
or
fully.
and,
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
truthful,
it
wasn't
full.
he
didn't
fully
respond
to
the
kind
of
questions
an
average
juror
would
have.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
believe
it
was
eight
trial
days.
a
weekend
was
involved.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
would,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
as
justice
white
said
in
the
swain
case,
this
is
a
very
important
right,
the
peremptory
right,
to
be
exercised
with
knowledge
and
with
truth
and
arbitrarily
by
the...
that
may
not
be
the
exact
words
in
your
opinion...
but
the
right
of
the
lawyers
and
this
court
has
even
held
where
courts
have
restricted
that
right
of
information
or
not
allowed
questions
to
be
asked
on
peremptory
or
not
asked
questions
which
lawyers
requested;
that
that
affected
the
right
of
peremptory...
the
use
of
the
peremptory
statute.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
right
and
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
the
tenth
circuit
said
if
it
is
de
minimus,
like
the
lady
with
the
$100
case
or
the
case
where
the
lawyer
didn't
ask
the
question,
it
was
so
vague
that
the
jury
didn't
understand
the
question,
it
can't
be
reversed
on
those
grounds.
but,
it
is
where
it
is
substantial
or
where
a
reasonable
jury
would
give
this
kind
of
information
that
a
lawyer
is
entitled
to
know
so
that
he
might
ask
follow-up
questions.
see,
any
juror,
any
juror
who
kind
of
says
accidents
are
apart
of
life
and
my
kids
all
have
accidents
and
has
that
kind
of
cavalier
attitude
isn't
a
good
juror
for
a
plaintiff
in
a
products
liability
case.
and,
i
would
have
considered
that
information.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
we
asked
for
two
hearings.
we
were
refused.
we
had
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
court
refused.
we
asked
for
argument,
asked
to
subpoena
jurors
again
in
our
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
well,
if
your
honor...
in
the
appendix,
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
filed...
was
mailed
before.
the
judge
got
it
the
5th.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
same
day
as
his
order
came
out
allowing
us
to
make
a
brief
and
polite
phone
call.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
can
your
honor
understand,
as
an
officer
of
that
court
with
the
attitude
of
a
strict
trial
judge
saying
brief
and
polite,
we
had
about
a
two-minute
conversation
which
he
said
those
things
that
are
agreed
to
in
the
record
which
affects...
which
doesn't
show
basic...
i
shouldn't
say
basic
misconduct
or
prejudice,
but
it
shows
information
that
i
would
have
liked
to
have
considered
in
making
my
three
selections.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
dissent
did.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
am
here
defending
that,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
motion
for
new
trial,
on
page
60,
only
informs
the
court,
and
the
affidavits,
the
two
affidavits--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--the
specific
information
was
not
communicated
to
the
trial
court
because
we
believe
that
we
were
prevented
from
making
a
record
by
the
trial
court
and
we
believe
that
the
trial
court
should
have
let
us,
on
motion
for
new
trial,
bring
the
juror
in
and
we
believe--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--yes,
yes.
on
page
94
of
the
appendix
we
request
oral
argument
and
request
the
court
subpoena
the
jurors.
we
felt
at
that
point--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--you
are
correct,
your
honor.
the
specifics--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--all
right,
sir.
the
reason
we
didn't
in
all
honesty,
sir,
is
because
we
felt
that
that
was
what
we
were
going
to
bring
up
on
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
hope
not,
sir.
i
hope
not.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
kansas
rule
is
kind
of
unique
because
when
we
had
filed
our
first
motion
for
just
cause,
as
the
rule
provides,
the
court
responded
there
was
no
concrete
evidence.
we
didn't
attempt
to
reach
a
threshold
and
should
have
been
required
under
kansas
rule
to
reach
a
threshold
with
no
concrete
evidence.
we
merely
had
to
show
just
cause
why
the
court
should
have
allowed
the
jurors
to
be
brought
in
under
oath
with
a
record
and
examined,
not
with
regard
to
prejudice,
but
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
they
withheld
information
necessary
for
the
right
of
the
exercise
of
the
peremptory
challenges.
and,
i
think
the
circuit
cases
i
have
looked
at,
there
is
only
one
that
i
think
disagrees
with
our
premise.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
an
excellent
question.
may
i
also
assume,
your
honor,
the
jury
went
the
other
way
and
decided
for
the
plaintiff?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
see,
that
is
the
significance.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
my
answer
is,
an
officer
of
the
court
with
defendant
there,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
his
oral
integrity...
i
mean,
on
the
basis
of
integrity,
have
to
agree--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--would
i
still
be
here
today?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
tenth
circuit,
under
the
previous
cases,
would
have
said,
go
back
for
a
new
trial
and--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--well,
if
i
understand
your
assumption
correctly,
the
tenth
circuit
in
these
three
cases,
two
preceding
this
one,
have
all
reversed
cases,
one
for
the
plaintiff,
where
the
defendant
has
appealed
because
somebody
didn't
mention
about
an
injury
case
or
a
trial
that
they
were
involved
in.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
well,
i
couldn't
have
been,
that
is
right.
and,
there
are
cases--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
could
have
been
prejudiced.
there
is
a
case
in
the
circuit
where
a
defendant...
there
was
a
juror
that
had
not
answered
questions
about
him
being
a
defendant
in
a
case
and
the
plaintiff
won
and
the
defendant
then
claimed
error
because
the
defendant
didn't
tell
about
his
being
a
defendant
in
a
case
and
the
circuit
said,
no,
it
didn't
work
against
you
so
there
is
no
error
there,
you
see.
i
don't
know
how
i
can
impress
an
argument--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
think
so
because--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--based
upon
our
theory
both
lawyers
have
a
right
to
know
this
information
about
a
person's
attitude
toward
bringing
cases
and
filing
suit.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
yes,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
no,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
yes.
this
could
have
developed
information
that
would
have
been
a
challenge
for
cause
that
allowed
us
another
peremptory,
but
i
don't
know
that
at
this
point.
the
significance
to
us,
and
i
think
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
other
circuits
are
all
in
agreement
except
for
one
case
in
the
fifth,
the
vezina
case,
i
think
all
agree
there
is
a
distinction
between
misconduct
of
the
jury
and
the
kind
of
prejudice
necessary
after
the
jury
becomes
a
jury
and
the
kind
of
information
that
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
right
to
exercise
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
hunch
or
belief--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--now
we
get
into
memory
again.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
counsel's
memory
and
notes
are
a
little
different
from
mine.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
there
are
our
recollections
that
are
in
the
record
on
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
where
counsel
agrees
with
them.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
in
the
appendix,
yes,
and
in
the
briefs
it
is
referred
to.
and,
counsel's
recollection
has
a
couple
of
phrases
in
addition
to
our
recollection.
the
important
thing
is
we
were
ordered
to
be
brief
and
the
call
was
so
short
that
i
didn't
feel,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
could
push
it
any
further.
and,
i
felt
that
the
fact
that
he
admitted
that
he
didn't
give
information
he
knew
about
and
was
aware
of,
because
accidents
are
apart
of
life
and
that
kind
of
cavalier
attitude,
i
thought
should
have
been
enough
for
the
trial
court
to
have
granted
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
at
least
held
a
hearing,
letting
us
subpoena
the
jurors
and
letting
us
establish
not
bias
and
not
prejudice--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--he
refused
to
allow
oral
argument.
we
asked
for
it
and
it
was
not
allowed.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
well,
we
submitted...
i
didn't
submit
specifics
of
the
word
conversation.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
correct.
we
felt
precluded
from
making
a
decent
record
and
we
didn't
feel
that
the
court
wouldn't
find
just
cause
to
let
us
examine
the
juror,
he
sure
wouldn't
believe
oral
conversations
or
attorneys--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
no,
sir.
that
is
correct,
sir.
and,
i
think
that
is
very
significant
because
they
say
that
the
important
thing
is
would
a
reasonable
juror
have
responded
and
if
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
responded,
then
the
plaintiff
was
entitled,
under
the
statute,
to
have
that
kind
of
response
from
this
juror
and
the
failure
of
his
giving
that
response
affected
my
right
to
peremptory
challenge
and
that
right
to
peremptory
challenge
would
indicate
or
that
would
also
indicate
implied
bias.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
we
didn't
know.
we
didn't
get
to
ask
him
enough--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--by
itself,
no.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
but,
the
follow-up
questions
may
have
developed
an
attitude
by
him
that
the
court
would
have
excused
for
cause.
that
is
my
point.
we
didn't
get
to
follow
up
and
say,
why
do
you
feel
that
accidents
are
apart
of
life
and
why
do
you
feel
everybody
has
accidents
and
why
do
you
think
that
it
is
not
important?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
we
ask--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--what
we
do
is
we
ask
the
general
question
and
then
if
you
get
responses
as
counsel...
as
i
did
and
as
counsel
did,
then
on
follow-up
questions...
and,
in
fact,
counsel
asked
two
or
three
follow-up
questions
on
accidents
and
injuries
after
i
finished
and
that
is
when
some
jurors
responded
to
some
de
minimus
type
of
events
that
happened
many
years
ago.
and,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
had
this
juror
had
responded,
both
myself
and
skilled
counsel
for
the
defendant
would
have
inquired
about
his
attitudes.
you
just
can't
ask
somebody
directly
are
you
prejudiced.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
agree.
and,
there
is
a
good
amicus
brief
in
this
case
filed
by
southern
union
company
where
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot.
but,
the
tenth
circuit
said
it
can
be
de
minimus
and
can
be
unimportant.
like,
for
example,
if
someone
said
i
have
got
six
kids
and
he
had
seven
kids
or
many
other...
there
is
a
tenth
circuit
case
where
someone
forgot
about
a
hundred
dollar
settlement.
they
said
that
is
de
minimus.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
substantial.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
that
is
right.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
whether
a
probable
bias
can
be
implied
sufficient
so
that
counsel,
with
the
right
to
full
information
of
the
statute,
could
use
a
peremptory
or
not
use
a
peremptory,
but
needs
that
information
to
exercise
his
right
of
peremptory.
the
basic
issue--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--subjectively,
because
of
the
rule
mr.
patterson
points
out.
you
can't
go
in
to
the
jury
and
say,
now,
after...
even
if
you
have
them
under
oath
and
say
are
you
bias?
nobody
admits
to
bias
and
there
is
language
in
all
your
cases
which
say
it
has
to
be
a
state
of
mind
that
can't
be
definitively
proven.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
three.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
okay,
let
me
mention.
after
the
six
are
empaneled,
the
jury
says,
now,
we
are
going
to
select
two
alternates
and
you
each
will
be
given
another
peremptory
challenge.
so,
after
the
sixth
juror
was
selected,
two
alternates
were
selected
and
we
were
each
given
another
peremptory
challenge
just
on
the
alternates.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
we
each
exercised
one.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
don't
remember.
but,
one
of
those
alternates
was--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--that
is
exactly
right,
sir.
and,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
only
exercising
two
peremptories,
because
when
you
have
got
12
in
the
box,
you
each
have
to
take
your
three
and
that
is
the
way
we
do
it
in
the
district
of
kansas
and
it
works.
and,
i
want
to
say
that
the
jury
system
works
and
the
three--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
don't
think
i--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
don't
think
i
said
this
case
was
a
freak.
if
i
did,
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it
was
a
freak.
i
said
it
was
unusual
because
the
accidental
way--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--pardon?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
do
think
the
jury
system
works
beautifully,
but
there
is
no
such
thing
that
works
beautifully
every
time.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
rule
which
keeps
us
from
talking
to
jurors
is
one
thing
and
it
maybe
a
good
rule,
but--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
how
what
got
in
the
record,
sir,
the--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--it
was
in
the
abstract
agreed
to
by
counsel
and
in
both
briefs
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
it
was
not
in
the
record.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
because
it
has
been
stipulated
to
be
correct.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
no.
i
guess
i
would
only
say,
your
honor,
is
that
we
feel
we
were
prohibited
from
making
a
proper
record
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
what
you
are
asking
me.
i--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--there
is
a
problem
with
the
record
and
we
believe
that
we
were
prohibited
from
making
that
record
by
the
trial
court's
refusal
to
let
us
bring
the
jurors
in
and
examine
them
on
the
record
and
under
oath.
we
had
no
other
alternative.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
wanted
to
mention
that
in
argument.
there
were
several
other
issues
in
the
tenth
circuit
that
were
not
decided
and
they
were
not
mentioned.
and,
i
would
cite
jackson,
the
second
circuit
case
of
1968,
where
the
circuit
court
stated
that
the
view
we
have
taken
of
juror
kemper's
disqualification
precludes
the
need
to
deal
with
other
points
raised
by
the
appellant.
there
are
serious
other
points
in
this
case.
the
court
has
three
alternatives,
i
suppose.
one
is
to,
i
think,
if
you
agree
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
to
send
it
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
say
decide
these
other
issues
you
didn't
mention,
because
you
can't
just
leave
them
hanging.
a
second
choice
would
be
to
send
it
back
to
the
trial
court
and
have
a
hearing
on
whether
or
not
this
untruthful
or
not
full
or
not
complete
response
to
the
question
affected
in
the
trial
court's
mind
a
right
to
the
statutory
peremptory
challenges
and
the
right
to
have
full
information
to
base
that
on.
we
think
that
those
are
the
only
two
alternatives
except
to
affirm
the
circuit
court,
which
we
respectfully
suggest
should
be
done,
because
the
circuit
court
said
in
this
case
the
kind
of
misinformation
or
non-information
rises
to
a
level
that
it
can
be
judged
by
an
appellate
court
to
be
so
important
that
it
affected
the
right
to
peremptory
challenge
by
the
very
nature
of
it.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
it
was
assessed
against
the
parties
or
the
non-parties--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--who
were
not
liable.
the
mother
of
the
little
boy,
mrs.
greenwood.
the
jury
put
35
percent
on
her
because
the
little
boy
was
outside
playing
in
a
neighbor's...
in
a
dead
end
street.
and,
the
boy
driving
the
mower
got
25
or
something
and
the
father
of
the
boy
who
owned
the
mower
got
45
percent.
so,
the
defendant,
who
we
contend
was
the
defective
manufacturer,
zero.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
the
new
trial...
there
is
a
new
trial
on
all
of
the
issues.
they
won't
reallocate
that.
they
have
remitted
it
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
it
is
possible
that
it
could
be.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
what
is
interesting...
i
have
never
seen
this
before,
and
i
want
to
say
just
quickly,
the
tenth
circuit
said,
"we
emphasize
that
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
is
not
a
groundless
one.
"
"the
district
court
found
plaintiff's
evidence
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
submission
on
the
theory
of
liability
to
the
jury.
"
"we
are
therefore
satisfied
that
our
remand
for
new
trial
is
not
an
exercise
in
futility.
"
that
is
a
footnote
after
the
state
reversed
the
remand
order.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
i
think
that
very
likely
that
would
be
the
result
of
a
new
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--billy
greenwood,
a
little
boy
who
lost
two
feet--
mr.
gene
e.
schroer
--because
of
a
defective
power
mower.
