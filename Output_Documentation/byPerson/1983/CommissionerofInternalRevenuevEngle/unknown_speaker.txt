unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
even
after
1975
are
bonuses
and
advance
royalties
income
from
the
property?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
consistent
with
our
decision
in
herring,
the
old
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
we
are
talking
about
here
or
the
amendments
that
specifically
changes
the
definition
of
gross
income
to
exclude
bonuses
and
advance
royalties
or
that
overrules
herring?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
did
not
change
the
definition
of
gross
income
is
what
you
are
saying,
but
it
did
state
that
the
deduction
for
percentage
depletion
had
to
be
with
respect
to
production.
unknown
speaker
now
is
the
statutory
language
not
given
better
effect
by
allowing
the
deduction
but
just
postponing
it
to
the
year
of
actual
production?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
if
that
is
not
a
better
application
of
this
statutory
language?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
converse?
what
if
you
have
a
deduction
in
one
year
and
no
income
until
the
next?
unknown
speaker
in
the
next
year
even
if
there
is
not
any
production.
so
he
does
not
apply
the
statute
literally
either.
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
that
he
would
not
if
you
have
advance
royalties
in
one
year
and
the
next
year
you
have
production
he
would
not
allow
the
depletion
of
the
royalties
received
in
a
prior
year?
unknown
speaker
he
will
not
do
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understood
you
correctly.
you
said
the
dominant
purpose
of
congress
in
granting
this
exemption
was
to
be
sure
there
was
some
production
of
oil
and
gas
unrelated
to
any
particular
time
period.
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
about
whether
there
was
this
refinement
of
the
general
objective
that
there
must
be
some
production
during
the
lease
term
which
would
be
consistent
with
the
old
law
and
it
really
would
not
make
much
difference
whether
you
had
a
year
beginning
or
the
end
of
the
year
lease
where
there
was
no
production
whereas
there
is
a
difference
under
the
proposed
regulations.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
no
production
during
the
entire
life
of
the
lease
even
the
taxpayer
would
agree
he
would
have
to
give
back
the--
unknown
speaker
--one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
was
to
discourage
the
practice
of
leasing
with
an
advance
royalty
payment
scheme?
unknown
speaker
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
the
commissioner's
position
will
discourage
this
particular
form
of
lease?
unknown
speaker
which
may
in
turn
cause--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
right.
we
are
only
talking
about
small
producers,
but
this
may
in
turn
make
it
more
difficult
for
small
producers
to
enter
into
advantageous
leases.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
he
loses
the
advantage
if
the
lessee
cannot
assure
him
that
there
will
be
production
in
the
year
in
which
he
is
first
receiving
royalties.
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
immediately
preceding
the
critical
section
where
it
says
"with
respect
to".
are
you
familiar
with
that?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
quite
read
it
that
way.
it
says
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
d
the
allowance
for
depletion
under
section
611
shall
be
computed
in
accordance
with
section
613
with
respect
to
so
much
of
the
taxpayers
average
daily
production
of
domestic
crude
oil
as
does
not
exceed
the
taxpayers
depletable
oil
quantity.
"
that
suggests
to
me
that
there
may
be
other
instances
of
depletion
allowance
that
are
not
embraced
within
that
language.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
does
the
commissioner
require
the
lessees
to
capitalize
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalty
payments
that
they
make
and
to
take
a
percentage
depletion
allowance
against
them
in
the
year
of
actual
production?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
does
any
of
the
history
address
covering
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
the
argument
based
on
herring
is?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
can
i
interrupt
you
one
second.
in
looking
at
the
language
from
the
1974
legislative
history
you
are
relying
on,
say
you
had
a
five-year
lease
with
a
five-year
lease
bonus
paid
in
five
installments,
equal
installments,
and
there
was
production
in
the
first
four
years
of
the
lease
but
not
in
the
fifth.
would
there
be
any
depletion
allowance
on
the
fifth
installment
of
the
lease
bonus
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
so
that
when
we
are
looking
at
lease
bonuses
we
do
not
care
whether
there
is
production
or
not.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question?
i
am
just
wondering
how
important
the
words
"lease
bonus"
are
and
i
guess
we
have
expressly
a
lease
bonus
in
one
case
and
an
advance
royalty
in
the
other
case.
is
it
conceivable
that
the
two
cases
could
be
decided
differently,
the
government
win
in
one
and
lose
in
the
other?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
lease
bonus
language
in
the
'74
report,
does
that
language
apply
with
the
same
force
to
the
advance
royalty
situation?
unknown
speaker
so
in
effect
in
your
argument
the
history
really
has
changed,
that
the
old
law
was
changed,
not
just
limited
to
a
certain
category
of
persons.
i
do
not
remember
the
name
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
the
herring
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
until
there
is
production
at
least.
unknown
speaker
under
their
view
once
there
is
production
it
could
be
attributable.
unknown
speaker
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
emphasis
on
years
are
if
i
understand
the
papers
correctly
there
are
situations
in
which
you
would
agree
that
in
a
fifth
year
of
a
lease
there
could
be
a
depletion
allowance
based
on
production
during
earlier
years
in
the
lease,
a
fifth
year
in
which
there
was
no
production
in
the
fifth
year.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
except
that
it
will
have
an
effect
on
the
way
in
which
people
will
negotiate
their
leases.
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
think
through.
unknown
speaker
other
people
do
not
get
that.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
did
the
seventh
circuit
believe
that
your
suggestive
interpretation
and
the
interpretation
submitted
by
your
opponents
both
were
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
yet
they
turned
down
your
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
did
they
give
an
explanation
for
rejecting
yours
or
for
saying
that
they
need
not
give
you
any
deference
at
all?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
if
you
look
at
the
conference
committee
report
because
this
language
was
added
in
a
floor
amendment
so
we
do
not
have
a
lot
of
history
to
go
by
and
if
you
just
look
at
the
conference
committee
report
for
the
language
that
was
actually
adopted,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
amend
the
definition
of
gross
income
from
property.
unknown
speaker
or
to
change
the
prior
result.
it
just
is
not
there.
you
cannot
find
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
also
indicated
that
it
intended
to
retain
the
percentage
depletion
privilege
for
the
independent
producer.
that
is
what
it
intended
to
do.
unknown
speaker
mr.
donnelly,
would
it
not
be
a
reasonable
position
for
the
commissioner
to
require
that
the
deduction...
even
if
you
are
right
about
the
fact
that
bonuses
and
advance
royalties
are
part
of
gross
income,
would
it
not
be
reasonable
for
the
commissioner
to
require
that
the
deduction
be
taken
in
the
year
of
actual
production?
unknown
speaker
well
then
maybe
that
is
what
congress
did
do.
unknown
speaker
mr.
donnelly,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
it
will
reveal
my
ignorance,
but
is
there
another
definition
of
the
term
"small
independent
producer"
in
the
statute
other
than
the--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
what
defines
it.
unknown
speaker
explain
this
to
me
then.
why
would
this
language
not
permit
one
of
the
giant
oil
companies
to
take
this
deduction
to
the
extent
that
their
production
did
not
exceed
this
limit?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
meaning
of
the
word
"small"
is
that
if
you
are
otherwise
an
independent
producer
then
you
may
take
depletion
up
to
the
maximum
limits
that
year.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
tends
to
support
your
view
that
this
is
a
limit
rather
than
a
basic
condition
for
eligibility.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
say,
do
you,
that
if
there
is
never
any
production
that
you
can
have
percentage
depletion
on
advance
royalties
or
bonus
payments?
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
a
precondition
to
claiming
percentage
depletion
on
this
income
other
than
being
a
small
producer?
unknown
speaker
there
has
to
be
some
production.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
be,
but
the
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
yes.
it
is
the
same
precondition
that
existed
before
1975?
unknown
speaker
mr.
collie,
are
you
referring
to
a
particular
point
in
the
briefs
here
that
you
would
like
to
have
us
look
at?
unknown
speaker
where
should
we
turn
to
look
at
the
act?
unknown
speaker
that
is
93
in
your
case.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
unknown
speaker
did
the
1974
bill...
what
did
that
do
with
respect
to
regulated
natural
gas
and
natural
gas
sold
under
fixed
contract?
unknown
speaker
for
preserving
or
eliminating?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
parallel
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
weighs
heavily
in
your
favor?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
that
weighs
heavily
in
your
favor?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
are
you
happy
to
report
that
none
of
them
is
a
student?
unknown
speaker
are
you
happy
to
report
that
none
of
them
is
a
student?
unknown
speaker
unless
he
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
collie,
before
you
go
on
do
i
understand
that
you
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
require
the
deduction
then
to
be
taken
in
the
year
of
the
actual
production?
unknown
speaker
well
would
it
not
be
consistent
with
it
and
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
that
the
commissioner
could
make?
unknown
speaker
so
perhaps
even
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
the
gross
income
issue
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
below
to
consider
deference
to
the
commissioner
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
could
disabuse
him
of
that
position
in
the
process.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
position?
supposing
you
had
a
lease
with
a
very
large
producer.
unknown
speaker
a
very
large
producer.
it
is
an
independent
producer
so
it
is
not
a
retailer
and
all
that
stuff,
which
produced
ten
barrels
on
december
31,
or
the
last
day
of
the
taxable
year
and
in
the
taxable
year
it
got
an
advance
royalty
of
$10
million
and
then
it
got
very
small
payments
but
very
large
production
thereafter.
would
it
get
the
full
deduction
under
your
view
in
the
first
year?
unknown
speaker
right.
