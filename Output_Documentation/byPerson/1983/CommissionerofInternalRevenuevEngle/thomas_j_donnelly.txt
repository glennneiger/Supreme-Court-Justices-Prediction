mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
engles
who
are
the
respondents
in
no.
82-599.
the
engles
received
$7600
in
advance
royalties
in
1975,
a
year
in
which
there
was
no
production
in
the
sense
of
physical
extraction
from
the
oil
and
gas
properties
that
were
involved.
the
engles
nevertheless
claimed
under
the
independent
producer
exemption
section
613a(c)
of
the
revenue
code
which
was
added
under
the
tax
reduction
act
of
1975
the
percentage
depletion
allowance.
the
tax
court
decided
against
the
engles'
position
finding
that
the
statute
had
overruled
the
decision
of
the
herring
case
and
required
production,
that
is,
that
the
payment
must
be
directly
related
to
production.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed
finding
that
there
was
no
production
requirement
imposed
by
the
statute
but
rather
that
the
statute
imposed
a
limitation
only
on
the
amount
that
would
be
eligible
for
the
deduction
in
effect
defining
who
is
the
small
independent
producer
that
was
to
have
available
to
him
a
continuing
percentage
depletion
allowance
though
congress
had
intended
to
eliminate
the
depletion
allowance
for
the
large
oil
company.
it
is
the
engles'
position
that
the
language
in
section
613a
which
requires
the
deduction
to
be
computed
in
accordance
with
section
613
requires
that
the
deduction
be
based
only
on
gross
income
from
the
property.
the
advance
royalties
are
gross
income
from
the
property.
there
is
nothing
in
section
613a
that
says
that
the
deduction
is
to
be
calculated
on
the
value
of
production,
and
mr.
phillips'
position
would
suggest
that
the
calculation
is
to
be
based
on
the
value
of
production.
since
we
contend
that
prior
law
was
to
be
retained
for
the
small
independent
producer,
a
brief
summary
of
prior
law
would
be
in
order.
under
the
herring
case
there
was
no
production
requirement.
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalties
were
eligible
for
percentage
depletion
in
the
same
manner
as
the
proceeds
of
actual
extraction.
there
was
a
recapture
rule
i
think
that
has
been
referred
to
before.
if
by
the
termination
of
the
lease
there
had
not
been
production
sufficient
to
justify
the
advance
royalty
or
lease
bonus,
then
under
the
tax
benefit
rule
the
amount
of
depletion
previously
claimed
would
be
recaptured.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
well,
i
think
that
would
be
reasonable,
but
under
the
statute
cannot
be
done.
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
can
only
be
taken
in
the
year
in
which
the
proceeds
or
the
money
is
received.
it
has
to
be
based
on
the
gross
income
from
the
property.
there
is
a
limitation
contained
in
section
613
that
it
may
not
exceed
50
percent
of
the
net
income
from
the
property
so
that
the
deduction,
its
calculation
requires
that
it
be
taken
in
the
year
in
which
the
money
is
received
for
cash
basis
taxpayers.
it
would
have
been
reasonable
i
think
for
congress
to
have
drafted
the
statute
so
that
at
the
time
there
is
production
the
depletion
allowance
be
taken.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
well,
congress...
you
see
under
the
1974
bill
that
mr.
phillips
referred
to
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
calculation
be
made
in
accordance
with
section
613.
that,
however,
is
in
the
1975
bill.
the
statute
does
not
say
compute
the
deduction
with
respect
to
the
barrelage
amount
allowed
under
section
613a(c)(1)(a).
it
says
the
calculation
is
to
be
made
in
accordance
with
section
613,
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
gross
income
from
the
property
on
so
much
of
the
production
as
does
not
exceed
the
barrel
limitation.
our
position,
of
course,
all
along
has
been
zero
production
does
not
exceed
2000
barrels.
if
we
had
zero
production
and
we
had
gross
income
from
the
property,
the
calculation
is
simply
to
be
based
on
the
gross
income
from
the
property.
only
in
the
event
that
our
production
should
exceed
2000
barrels
a
day
would
the
limitation
come
into
play.
we
believe
that
we
are
indeed
then
what
congress
intended
to
define
as
a
small
independent
producer.
the
statutory
history,
i
think,
has
been
given,
and
we
believe
that
since
the
independent
producers
exemption
was
inserted
into
the
law
as
a
result
of
the
senate
amendment
that
the
senate
committee
report
is
of
particular
relevance.
that
report
indicates
that
it
was
the
intention
to
retain
percentage
depletion
for
the
small
independent
producer.
we
believe
that
this
meant
that
prior
law
was
to
be
retained
as
to
the
calculation
of
the
exemption
for
the
small
independent
producer,
that
the
words
613>
["]
fully
reflect
the
intention
of
congress
to
make
the
calculation
in
accordance
with
prior
law.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
this
is
the
definition.
the
statute
prevents
large
retailers
and
large
refiners
and
large
producers
if
you
fall
into
any
one
of
those
categories
from
being
eligible
for
the
small
independent
producer
exemption.
the
intent
was
to
eliminate
percentage
depletion
for
the
large
oil
company.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
well,
most
of
the
giant
oil
companies
are
retailers
and
refiners
or
one
of
the
two.
if
you
are
a
retailer
or
a
refiner
you
cannot
use
the
small
independent
producer
exemption.
if
you
are
a
producer
only
the
oil
company
would
be
eligible
for
the
exemption
within
the
limitations
of
the
small
independent
producer
exemption.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
if
production
limits
do
not
exceed
that
total,
you
are
considered
a
small
producer
and
you
are
entitled
to
the
full
depletion--
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
--we
believe
that
it
does
support
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
in
the
case
of
our
client,
our
client
received
$7600
in
advance
royalties
based
on
the
price
of
oil
as
it
existed
in
1975.
that
would
have
been
the
equivalent
of
less
than
one
barrel
of
oil
per
day
as
compared
to
the
2000
which
the
statute
allows.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
justice
white,
we
recapture.
if
by
the
termination
of
the
lease
the
production
had
not--
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
--the
precondition--
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
--the
precondition
claiming
percentage
depletion
on
advance
royalties
has
always
been
that
ultimately--
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
--so
as
to
avoid
recapture.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
donnelly
that
is
correct.
the
effect
of
the
government's
position
on
us
i
think
can
be
expressed
by
an
example.
let
us
assume
that
there
were
$7600
in
advance
royalties
received
in
1975,
a
5
percent
royalty
rate
and
no
physical
extraction.
in
1976
$200,000
in
value
of
oil
is
extracted
from
the
property.
$10,000
then
in
royalty
would
have
been
earned,
5
percent
of
$200,000.
the
$7600
advance
would
be
offset
against
the
$10,000
earned
and
the
balance
of
$2400
would
be
owing.
further
assume
the
$2400
is
paid
in
1977.
the
government's
position
would
give
us
no
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
1975
because
there
was
no
physical
extraction.
we
would
get
no
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
1976
because
there
was
no
gross
income
from
the
property,
and
in
1977
i
thought
that
under
the
government's
position
in
this
case
we
would
get
no
percentage
depletion
during
that
year
either;
however,
mr.
phillips
has
said
that
the
government
would
condescend
in
that
year
because
there
had
been
prior
production
to
grant
depletion
on
a
reasonable
quantity
whatever
that
is,
whatever
he
may
mean
by
that,
the
gross
income
from
the
property
which
is
paid
during
that
year.
we
think
the
statute
does
not
work
as
to
that.
the
statute
also
does
not
work
as
to
an
extractor
who,
for
example,
receives
$100,000
in
advance
in
1975
in
anticipation
of
production
in
1976.
he
gets
no
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
1975.
in
1976
let's
assume
there
is
$200,000
in
production.
the
$100,000
advance
is
offset.
it
is
previously
paid.
the
gross
income
from
the
property
is
only
$100,000.
this
is
all
he
can
take
percentage
depletion
with
respect
to.
we
think
that
the
difficulty
with
the
government's
position
is
found
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
question
presented
in
its
original
brief
where
the
question
presented
is
stated,
"section
613a(2)(a)...
actually
that
is
a
misprint.
"
"it
should
be
a(1)(a)--
"
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
allows
a
percentage
depletion
deduction
to
be
computed
613
",
the
significance
of
those
words
being
that
the
deduction
has
to
be
calculated
on
the
gross
income
from
the
property.
"
"the
government,
however,
eliminates
those
words
when
it
paraphrases
this
section
of
the
code.
"
they
then
go
on,
"with
respect
to"...
eliminating
the
words
"so
much
of
the"...
"the
average
daily
production
of
oil
or
gas.
"
--eliminating
the
words
"as
does
not
exceed"...
"defined
in
terms
of
production
for
any
taxable
year.
"
the
government
attempts
to
convert
the
statutory
language
which
imposes
merely
a
limitation
into
a
production
requirement.
this
is
the
same
thing
the
government
attempted
to
do
at
the
time
of
herring
some
50
years
ago
to
impose
a
production
requirement,
but
a
production
requirement
does
not
work
with
a
statute
that
bases
the
calculation
on
gross
income
from
the
property.
thank
you.
