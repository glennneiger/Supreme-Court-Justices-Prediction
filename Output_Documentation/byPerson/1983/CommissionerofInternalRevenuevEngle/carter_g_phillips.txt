mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
section
613a
of
the
internal
revenue
code
permits
a
lessor
of
oil
and
gas
property
who
receives
an
advance
payment
upon
the
execution
of
a
lease,
the
advance
payment
either
in
the
form
of
a
lease
bonus
or
an
advance
royalty,
is
entitled
to
a
percentage
depletion
deduction
against
those
royalties
even
though
no
oil
or
gas
allocated
to
that
income
is
produced
during
the
taxable
year.
the
facts
in
both
of
these
cases
are
not
disputed.
in
the
farmar
case
in
1976
taxpayers
leased
the
mineral
estate
of
lands
they
owned
in
texas
to
two
companies
interested
in
oil
and
gas
exploration.
part
of
the
compensation
for
that
agreement
was
a
substantial
lease
bonus
to
be
paid
in
installments,
and
that
was
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
actual
production
of
oil
or
gas.
instead,
it
was
based
on
the
acreage
of
the
lease.
taxpayers
also
included
in
that
agreement
a
provision
allowing
them
to
receive
royalties
for
any
oil
or
gas
actually
produced.
during
the
1976
tax
year
oil
and
gas
was
extracted
from
those
properties,
and
a
royalty
was
paid.
taxpayers
in
their
1976
federal
income
tax
returns
claimed
a
22
percent
depletion
deduction
for
both
the
lease
bonus
payment
and
the
royalty.
in
the
engle
case
in
1975
the
taxpayers
assigned
a
lease
to
properties
they
had
in
wyoming
to
producers
in
return
for
an
overriding
royalty.
as
part
of
the
compensation
scheme
there
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
received
an
advance
royalty
of
$7600.
during
the
1975
tax
year
there
was,
however,
no
production.
nevertheless,
the
taxpayers
on
their
federal
income
tax
returns
for
1975
claimed
a
22
percent
depletion
deduction
for
the
advanced
royalties
that
they
had
received.
in
both
of
these
cases
the
commissioner
assessed
a
deficiency
by
disallowing
the
percentage
depletion
deductions
for
payments
that
were
received
that
had
no
relationship
to
any
actual
production
during
the
taxable
year.
the
farmars
paid
the
deficiency
and
filed
suit
for
return
of
the
monies
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
engles,
on
the
other
hand,
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
claims
unanimously
and
the
tax
court
by
a
vote
of
14
to
1
upheld
the
commissioner's
decision
and
determined
that
section
613a
did
not
allow
deductions
in
the
absence
of
production
during
the
taxable
year.
the
engles
appealed
the
judgment
of
the
tax
court
to
the
seventh
circuit
which
reversed.
both
the
commissioner
and
the
farmar's
filed
separate
petitions
to
this
court.
they
were
granted
and
the
case
consolidated.
prior
to
1975
it
was
clear
that
the
lease
bonuses
and
advance
royalties
at
issue
in
this
case
would
have
been
subject
to
the
percentage
depletion
deduction.
prior
to
1975
under
section
611
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
allows
a
deduction
for
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
and
section
613
which
allows
a
deduction
for
gross
income
from
the
oil
or
gas
producing
property
this
court
had
concluded
the
only
statutory
condition
for
allowance
of
the
depletion
deduction
was
the
existence
of
gross
income,
and
since
this
court
had
also
concluded
that
advance
payments
either
in
the
form
of
lease
bonuses
of
advance
royalties
were
gross
income
from
the
property
the
deduction
was
permitted.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
ma'am.
i
believe
they
would
still
remain
as
income
from
the
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
we
do
not
dispute
that
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
nothing
that
expressly
does
that.
congress
did
add
subsection
d
to
section
613
in
1975.
subsection
d
says
you
do
not
start
with
section
613
which
is
the
provision
that
forces
you
to
look
at
gross
income.
instead
it
says
that
you
look
first
at
section
613a
and
only
for
so
much
of
the
production
as
you
can
demonstrate
satisfies
the
requirements
of
section
613a
do
you
then
come
back
into
section
613
and
apply
the
gross
income
tests
under
herring
and
for
that
matter
all
of
the
commissioner's
rulings
regarding
gross
income.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
of
course,
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
they
are
seeking
to
assert
the
deduction
in
this
taxable
year.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
will
concede
that
that
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language.
the
commissioner's
view
is
that
the
focus
in
section
613a
on
production
in
the
taxable
year
seems
to
expect
that
that
is
the
taxable
year
that
they
focus
on.
when
the
income
is
acquired
prior
to
actual
production
the
commissioner
has
concluded
that
congress
simply
did
not
intend
for
that
to
be
subject
to
the
depletion
allowance.
as
i
said,
justice,
i
think
in
this
case
where
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
both
interpretations
are
reasonable
i
submit
that
you
could
probably
make
a
reasonable
argument
with
regard
to
the
hypothetical
you
set,
but
i
think
it
important
to
make
clear
that
regardless
of
how
you
decide
your
hypothetical
you
would
still
deny
the
deduction
for
the
taxpayers
in
these
cases.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
commissioner
has
taken
the
position
at
least
with
respect
to
the
hypothetical
he
presented
in
his
proposed
regulations
that
if
you
have
say
$100,000
of
production
in
one
year
and
$85,000
of
income
in
that
year
and
$15,000
of
income
in
the
next
year
he
will
permit
you
the
$15,000
deduction
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--not
precisely.
i
think
the
exception
made
for
that...
it
is
not
clear
that
he
would
allow
that
if
all
of
the
income
were
derived
in
a
separate
year,
only
if
a
small
portion
is.
in
addition,
it
is
clear
that
that
distinction
that
the
commissioner
has
drawn
is
fully
consistent
with
the
intention
and
purpose
of
section
613a.
that
is,
congress'
dominant
concern
was
to
assure
the
production
of
oil
and
gas,
the
extraction
of
oil
in
hand
and
certainly
under
the
hypothetical
that
the
commissioner
has
proposed
you
have
production
in
hand
so,
therefore,
he
has
decided
to
go
ahead
and
allow
that.
certainly
no
taxpayers
are
likely
to
complain
about
the
proposed
regulation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
seems
clear,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
will
not
do
that.
he
will
be
allowed
cost
depletion
for
the
income
that
you
have
received
in
the
prior
year.
they
will
not
allow
the
special
advantage
frankly
that
is
afforded
through
percentage
depletion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
during
the
taxable
year.
i
failed
to
say
that,
but
i
believe
that
congress'
dominant
concern
was
some
production
prior
to
the
income.
i
think...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
of
course,
the
proper
result
in
this
case
does
not
really
hang
on
whether
or
not
the
proposed
regulations
are
consistent.
it
seems
to
me
we
are
still
dealing
with
this
particular
case
which
is
a
situation
where
we
have
income
and
no
production.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
but
it
seems
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statute
to
expect
that
congress
may
have
preferred
to
have
production
as
quickly
as
possible
and
not
postpone
it
five
to
ten
years.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
not
to
discourage
it
particularly
but
simply
not
to
provide
the
extraordinary
encouragement
that
percentage
depletion
would
otherwise
grant.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
from
the
prior
practice,
yes,
it
will
not
be
as
readily
adopted
but
of
course--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--anybody
other
than
a
small
producer
would
not
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
the
small
producer
retains
the
very
substantial
advantage
that
comes
when
there
is
production
on
the
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct.
but
most
royalty
owners
i
would
imagine
would
still
realize
that
a
small
producer
if
there
is
reasonable
likelihood
of
production
will
offer
the
advantages
of
percentage
depletion
that
were
not
available
if
he
used
a
large
producer
so
that
all
this
does
is
make
the
large
producer
small
producer
equal
with
regard
to
advance
payments
from
which
no
oil
is
produced
and
for
which
congress
presumably
had
no
real
concern
or
interest
in.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1975
congress
in
the
tax
reduction
act
eliminated
for
the
most
part
percentage
depletion
allowance
for
oil
and
gas.
after
1975
the
existence
of
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
was
no
longer
contingent
exclusively
on
the
existence
of
gross
income.
instead
congress
added
subsection
d
to
section
613
which
expressly
requires
the
taxpayer
to
determine
availability
of
any
deduction,
percentage
deduction
that
is,
under
section
613a
first
and
then
determine
on
the
basis
of
whether
you
comply
with
the
requirements
of
section
613a
how
much
of
the
deduction
generally
specified
in
section
611
will
be
computed
specifically
under
section
613.
congress
in
section
613a
permitted
percentage
depletion
for
a
royalty
owner
such
as
the
taxpayers
in
these
cases
who
leased
to
an
independent
producer
"with
respect
to
so
much
of
the
taxpayer's
average
daily
production
of
domestic
crude
oil
as
does
not
exceed
the
taxpayer's
depletable
oil
and
natural
gas
quantity.
"
average
daily
production
is
determined
by
dividing
the
aggregate
production
for
the
year
by
the
number
of
days
in
the
taxable
years.
the
depletable
quantity
is
an
arbitrary
number
that
the
congress
had
set
in
order
to
limit
the
maximum
amount
of
production
and
the
guarantee
that
the
producers
were
in
effect
small
producers.
as
the
majority
of
the
tax
court
held,
section
613a
places
repeated
emphasis
on
the
concept
of
production,
and
production
itself
commonly
means
extraction
from
the
ground
and,
therefore,
it
is
fair
to
read
the
statutory
language
itself
as
requiring
actual
production
during
the
taxable
year,
and
accordingly
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
who
cannot
attribute
any
of
their
income
to
actual
production
during
the
taxable
year
are
not
entitled
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
of
section
613a
to
a
percentage
depletion
deduction.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
our
view
is
that
the
611
to
be
computed
under
section
613.
the
"with
respect
to"
language
is
actually
the
pivotal
language
in
our
mind
in
determining
that
production
is
crucial
because
it
is
only
with
respect
to
so
much
production
that
you
are
allowed
any
kind
of
a
depletion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
agree
with
that.
it
is
clear
that
it
is
with
respect
to
both
that
you
have
to
have
some
production
and
with
respect
to
so
much
as
does
not
exceed
the
depletable
quantity.
so
anything
over
2000
barrels
in
1975
will
not
be
with
respect
to
which
you
can
deduct
under
the
percentage
depletion.
just
as
if
you
do
not
have
any
production
it
is
with
respect
to
zero
production
that
you
are
allowed
the
depletion.
so
i
would
read
that
language
as
saying
with
respect
to
whatever
number
between
1
and
2000
barrels
are
produced
by
primary
means
of
extraction.
of
course,
the
taxpayers
are
still
entitled
to
cost
depletion
under
section
612,
but
in
our
reading
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
they
are
no
longer
entitled
to
percentage
depletion
simply
as
a
simple
arithmetic
means.
that
is,
the
numerator
of
aggregate
production
is
zero
divided
by
any
number
obviously
equals
zero,
and
so
with
respect
to
how
much
production
is
there
a
deduction
the
answer
is
zero.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
he
does
not
permit
them...
they
have
historically
not
been
permitted
to
take
the
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalty
and
deplete
that,
use
percentage
depletion
on
that.
he
does
require
them
to
capitalize
it
as
a
straight
deduction.
he
continues
to
take
the
view
that
the
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalties
are
not
subject
to
the
percentage
depletion
allowance
to
the
lessee.
that,
by
the
way,
is
compelled
i
think
in
the
house
committee
report
in
1974.
we
submit
that
the
result
compelled
by
the
statutory
language
is
equally
supported
by
the
only
relevant
legislative
history
in
this
case.
when
the
tax
reduction
act
was
passed
out
of
the
house
committee
in
1975
it
contained
no
provision
with
regard
to
oil
and
gas
depletion,
and
an
amendment
on
the
house
floor
completely
abolished
oil
and
gas
depletion
which
passed.
the
bill
then
went
to
the
senate.
again,
the
senate
finance
committee
reported
out
a
bill
that
again
contained
no
provision
for
oil
and
gas
depletion,
and
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
was
the
amendment
added
that
conforms
basically
to
section
613a.
all
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
this
issue
below
have
concluded
that
reading
the
legislative
history
in
1975
provides
no
useful
insights
into
the
solution
of
the
problem
presented
by
these
cases.
that
is,
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
tells
you
how
to
treat
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalties.
however,
in
1974
during
the
prior
congress,
indeed
the
last
session
of
the
prior
congress
and
merely
four
months
prior
to
the
date
that
the
conference
committee
announced
the
final
section
613a
compromise,
the
house
considered
legislation
that
had
been
proposed
by
wilbur
mills
then
the
chairman
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
that
is
strikingly
similar
to
section
613a.
that
legislation
provided
a
percentage
depletion
deduction
that
was
permissible
again
with
respect
to
so
much
of
the
taxpayers
average
daily
production
of
domestic
crude
oil
as
in
that
bill
did
not
exceed
3000
barrels.
average
daily
production
in
that
legislation
was
defined
precisely
as
it
is
defined
in
section
613a.
when
that
bill
was
reported
out
of
committee
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
made
the
only
statement
that
is
directly
relevant
to
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case,
and
the
house
committee's
report
states
thus
the
deduction
applies
to
gross
income
attributable
to
oil
which
is
sold
or
removed
from
the
premises
and
not
to
other
types
of
depletable
income.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
directly?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
is
that
it
obviously
did
not
require
congress
to
have
considered
the
prior
law
in
order
to
change
that
law.
if
it
adopts
language
in
the
statute
that
is
just
completely
inconsistent
with
the
basic
ground
rules
that
gave
rise
to
the
herring
decision
which
we
submit
it
did,
then
herring
is
just
no
longer
appropriate
as
a
basis
for
decision.
the
house
committee
report
says
expressly,
for
example,
a
lease
bonus
paid
to
the
lessor
of
mineral
lands
in
a
lump
sum
or
in
installments
is
independent
of
any
actual
production
from
the
lease
and
thus
would
not
be
within
any
of
the
exemptions.
that
is
directly
inconsistent
with
herring,
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
meant
to
change
the
rules
that
income
alone
was
no
longer
the
basis
for
percentage
depletion.
what
was
necessary
now
is
actual
production
and
that
in
the
taxable
year.
i
take
it
as
self-evident
frankly
that
if
that
legislative
statement
had
been
included
by
the
senators
who
proposed
the
amendment
in
1975
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
that
these
cases
would
not
be
here
today.
there
is
simply
no
way
to
mask
the
clear
intent
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
four
months
before
this
actual
legislation
was
passed
with
regard
to
exactly
what
this
language
means,
and
it
is
the
with
respect
to
the
taxpayers
average
daily
production
that
is
the
pivotal
language
in
the
1975
legislation,
and
under
our
theory
that
is
precisely
the
same
language
that
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
was
interpreting
in
1974.
we
submit
there
is
simply
no
justification
for
doing
as
the
seventh
circuit
did
to
disregard
the
only
clearly
relevant
legislative
history
we
have
to
tell
us
what
that
statute
meant
and
intended
in
the
cases
we
have
before
us
today,
nor
indeed
do
we
believe
that
such
an
extraordinary
result
as
the
seventh
circuit
reached
can
be
justified
simply
on
the
basis
that
congress
failed
to
make
reference
to
the
prior
law
with
regard
to
lease
bonuses
and
advance
royalties
in
1975.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
there
would
not
be
any
depletion
allowance
on
any
of
the
lease
bonus
under
the
interpretation
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
in
1974
because
they
say
that
lease
bonus
is
clearly
not
attributable
to
income
from
production.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
production.
it
is
based
on
acreage
and,
therefore,
it
is
not
subject
to
the
depletion
allowance,
percentage
depletion
allowance.
it
is
still
subject
to
cost
depletion
but
not
percentage
any
longer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
house
committee's
report.
the
seventh
circuit
believed
that
it
could
reach
a
contrary
result.
the
seventh
circuit
in
reaching
its
decision
first
stated
that
under
the
statutory
language
the
commissioner's
interpretation
was
perfectly
reasonable.
under
the
legislative
history
in
1975
the
commissioner's
interpretation
was
perfectly
reasonable.
that
recognized
that
the
1974
legislative
history
if
considered
provided
substantial
support
for
the
commissioner's
interpretation,
and
it
blinded
itself
to
all
of
that
and
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
failure
of
congress
in
1975
to
expressly
state
that
it
was
going
to
overturn
prior
law.
in
the
context
of
what
congress
was
doing
in
1975
that
simply
ignores
the
reality
of
that
congressional
session.
congress
acted
within
six
days
between
the
time
that
the
senate
proposed
the
amendment
and
the
house
committee...
excuse
me,
the
house-senate
conference
committee
adopted
the
compromise
solution
to
this
proposal
that
that
legislation
came
out.
in
the
context
of
eliminating
almost
all
percentage
depletion
allowance
it
is
just
simply
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
anyone
would
have
worried
about
this
very
small
portion
of
the
problem
of
percentage
depletion.
the
future
of
percentage
depletion
simply
was
in
no
way
contingent
on
the
treatment
of
the
royalty
owner's
advance
royalties
and
lease
bonuses.
therefore,
it
is
not
appropriate
to
rely
on
the
failure
to
make
comment
in
1975
as
the
basis
for
deciding
this
case.
in
1975
congress
was
reacting
to
a
severe
oil
shortage
which
caused
the
price
of
deregulated
oil
to
skyrocket.
it
responded
by
eliminating
the
extraordinary
tax
advantages
that
percentage
depletion
had
previously
granted
in
most
situations.
congress
decided
to
continue
to
give
some
depletion
protection
to
independent
producers,
but
it
quite
reasonably
withheld
the
percentage
depletion
advantage
to
situations
where
oil
was
actually
extracted
during
that
taxable
year
and
even
then
only
so
long
as
the
amounts
reflected
a
small
producer.
in
all
other
situations
congress
simply
relegated
the
taxpayer
to
the
cost
depletion
that
most
other
taxpayers
are
able
to
use
in
most
of
their
industries.
taxpayers
here
were
entitled
to
the
latter.
they
were
not
entitled
to
the
former.
the
federal
circuit
correctly
so
held,
and
its
judgment
in
farmar
should
be
affirmed.
the
seventh
circuit's
holding
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
conceivable
that
we
could.
i
do
not
think
the
congress
intended
to
draw
a
distinction.
i
think
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
since
the
advance
royalties
and
lease
bonuses
had
historically
been
treated
essentially
the
same
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
draw
a
distinction
between
them
simply
because
congress
in
its
example
referred
to
lease
bonus.
if
you
take
the
more
general
statement
that
proceeds
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
herring?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no.
i
do
not
believe
so
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
still
the
question
of
what
is
gross
income
and
if
you
have
gross
income
whether
you
are
entitled
to
a
depletion.
i
do
not
think
that
has
been
modified
at
all.
it
simply
tells
you
that
it
has
to
have
some
production
that
goes
with
it.
that
is
just
simply
adding
a
precondition.
once
you
satisfy
the
precondition
herring
applies
just
as
it
always
had.
i
do
not
think
congress
had
intended
to
change
that,
nor
would
i
expect
them
to
have
made
reference
to
that
portion
of
it.
the
reason
i
think
it
inappropriate
to
distinguish
between
lease
bonus
and
advance
royalties
is
because
the
sentence
that
precedes
this
specific
example
talks
generally
about
attributing
income
to
production,
and
that
is
just
as
true
in
an
advanced
royalty
as
a
lease
bonus.
that
is,
an
advance
royalty
with
no
production
the
income
is
just
not
attributable
to
any
production.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
but
if
that
is
not
done
in
the
taxable
year
then
the
statutory
language
itself
makes
clear
that
you
ought
not
to
be
entitled
to
the
percentage
deduction
in
that
year.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
there
were
income.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
production.
the
commissioner's
proposed
regulation
does
suggest
that
that
is
true
that
he
will
accept
at
least
some
portion
of
income
in
a
subsequent
year
although
the
production
precedes
it.
the
facial
inconsistency
with
the
statutory
language
as
we
read
it
in
this
case
is
conceded,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
notion
of
allowing
the
deduction
in
that
situation
is
fully
consistent
with
the
purpose
here.
that
is,
the
purpose
is
to
have
oil
and
that
purpose
is
fully
served.
as
i
say,
i
doubt
that
any
taxpayers
will
complain
about
the
commissioner's
interpretation
on
that
side.
they
seem
only
to
be
complaining
about
the
commissioner's
interpretation
on
this
side.
moreover,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
tail
of
how
you
deal
with
that
problem
should
wag
the
dog
of
how
you
deal
with
this
essential
problem
here.
that
is,
we
still
have
to
decided
this
case
first.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
will
have
some
effect
on
the
way
they
negotiate
their
leases,
but
i
do
not
think
it
undermines
the
basic
purpose
which
was
to
encourage
independent
producers
to
continue
producing,
that
is,
because
they
still
have
the
basic
advantage
when
you
get
to
income
when
you
have
actual
production
and
actual
income
you
still
get
a
significant
advantage
with
percentage
depletion
that
you
simply
do
not
get
otherwise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
right.
large
producers
do
not
get
that
so
if
you
go
to
amoco
or
exxon
or
someone
and
ask
them
to
drill
your
hole
if
you
get
a
lot
if
income
you
are
not
going
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
what
they
said.
the
statutory
language
supports
either
interpretation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
an
extraordinary
result
in
our
view.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
they
gave
no
explanation
for
why
the
commissioner
ought
not
to
receive
some
deference
in
interpreting
his
statute
or
why
the
tax
court
should
receive
no
deference
in
interpreting
the
statute.
they
simply
said
that
failure
of
congress
in
1975
to
make
express
reference
to
prior
law
was
the
basis
for
deciding
against
the
commissioner.
we
submit
the
commissioner's
interpretation
should
be
upheld.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
do
not
believe--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
definition
of
gross
income
from
property
has
been
changed
or
need
be
changed
in
order
to
support
our
interpretation.
second
of
all
it
seems
perfectly
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
conference
committee
six
days
after
the
senate
amendment
would
be
sitting
down
trying
to
sort
out
these
problems.
the
problems
that
the
conference
committee
addressed
itself
to
were
twofold.
first,
the
conference
said
we
are
going
to
keep
percentage
depletion
at
22
percent.
that
is
how
we
resolved
the
difference
between
the
house
and
the
senate
version.
second
of
all,
we
are
going
to
keep
the
depletable
quantity
at
2000
barrels.
that
is
the
difference
between
the
3000
and
the
1000
barrel
proposals
that
were
in
the
senate.
you
would
expect
that
in
the
conference
they
are
going
to
explain
just
what
the
differences
were
and
how
they
were
resolved,
and
that
is
all
the
conference
report
discusses.
that
makes
sense
in
context,
but
that
is
not
basis
for
saying
that
our
interpretation
should
not
be
adopted
simply
because
congress
did
not
go
further
and
explain
every
other
problem
that
might
exist.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no
it
said
it
intended
to
retain
the
percentage
depletion
at
22
percent
for
2000
barrels.
what
it
retained
was
the
senate's
version
of
22
percent
and
retained
the
senate's
version
of
2000
barrels.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
intending
to
retain
any
more
than
that
and
even
the
seventh
circuit
in
its
decision
in
this
case
declined
to
read
into
retains
in
the
context
of
that
conference
committee
report
anything
other
than
it
is
out
there
and
that
it
explained
what
the
compromise
in
conference
was
about.
thank
you.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
