mr.
marvin
k.
collie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
represent
two
taxpayer
ranchholders
in
west
texas
by
the
name
of
the
farmars
and
the
suggs.
they
executed
oil
and
gas
leases
in
1975
providing
for
installment
bonuses.
they
received
a
part
of
their
installment
in
1976.
in
that
same
year
they
also
received
a
royalty
paid
as
a
part
of
the
actual
production
from
their
leases.
not
only
is
that
a
differentiation
that
one
should
note
as
a
fact
but
also
there
is
actual
proof
in
this
case
that
as
the
amount
of
the
bonus
goes
up
the
amount
of
the
percentage
royalty
goes
down
and
vice
versa.
as
a
matter
of
economic
logic
that
must
be.
may
i
digress
from
what
i
would
otherwise
say
to
perhaps
address
what
justice
stevens
was
asking
about.
there
is
a
very
pertinent
point
to
be
realized
that
a
person
that
does
not
have
substantial
economic
means
is
going
to
take
the
bonus
because
of
the
certainty
of
income
regardless
of
the
depletion
allowance
because
he
must
have
those
dollars
in
hand
and
he
cannot
afford
to
gamble
on
the
royalty
that
might
ultimately
be
greater
if
he
said
forget
the
bonus
and
i
will
take
the
greater
royalty
in
the
future.
now
with
respect
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
which
was
filed
just
a
week
ago,
we
believe
it
would
be
profitable
to
spend
a
few
moments
on
that
reply
brief,
and
in
that
connection
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
if
it
should
choose
to
do
so
to
look
at
the
copies
of
section
613a
and
the
bill
in
1974.
we
thought
it
might
be
more
convenient
for
the
court
if
it
could
lay
those
two
down
side
by
side
because
what
that
shows
one
when
it
is
done
it...
section
613a,
and
it
is
unfortunate
they
put
a
cap
"a"
there
because
of
a
section
reference.
it
is
not
a
small
613
cap
a.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
sir,
justice
rehnquist,
what
i
am
referring
to
is
where
the
brief
says
there
is
remarkable
similarity
between
the
1974
bill
and
the
act
that
came
out
as
613a.
if
we
could
look
at
the
act
for
a
moment
then
i
would
like
to
compare
it
to
the
other
bill
and
show
the
difference.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
sir,
in
the
application
for
certiorari
the
last
page,
page
93,
has
that.
it
actually
starts
at
page
92.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
in
application
for
certiorari
in
my
case,
yes,
sir.
the
point
that
we
desire
to
make
is
that
section
613a
says
that
without
regard
to
section
613,
the
old
act
granting
depletion,
we
will
have
two
exceptions.
one
is
an
exception
for
certain
domestic
gas
wells
and
then
it
starts
off
with
respect
to
the
exception
for
certain
gas
wells
with
this
very
important
language,
this
clinching
language.
"the
allowance
for
depletion
under
section
611
shall
be
computed
in
accordance
with
section
613
with
respect
to.
"
and
then
it
mentioned
two
types
of
natural
gas
that
will
still
get
percentage
depletion.
then
it
drops
down
in
subsection
c
to
the
exemption
for
independent
producers
and
royalty
owners,
and
it
starts
off
the
same
way.
it
says
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
d.
"
--which
is
irrelevant
for
our
question...
"the
allowance
for
depletion
under
section
611
shall
be
computed
under
and
in
accordance
with
section
613.
"
now
why
did
congress
choose
that
cross-reference,
this
webb
of
cross-references
that
it
has
woven
into
the
fabric
of
the
internal
revenue
code?
it
is
because
congress
wanted
to
tell
us
that
we
wanted
to
go
back
to
613.
we
want
all
of
the
law,
the
regulations,
the
baggage,
the
decisions
of
this
court
including
herring
in
order
that
we
can
see
when
we
go
to
the
limitation
that
congress
meant
for
this
court
to
look
and
meant
for
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
look
at
what
it
has
said
before
over
a
period
of
50
years
with
respect
to
section
611
through
section
613.
that
is
the
important
thing.
when
the
legislative
history
of
the
prior
bill
in
1974
is
referred
to
by
the
government
and
saying
that
there
it
said
you
cannot
have
the
bonus,
the
depletion
on
the
bonus,
look
what
that
bill
says.
it
does
not
have
anything,
not
a
word,
about
a
cross-reference
to
section
611,
not
a
word
about
a
cross-reference
to
section
613.
there
is
the
all-important
difference
between
the
bill
that
the
irs
would
have
us
look
at
and
the
actual
enactment
in
1975.
the
legislative
history
may
be
different,
but
it
is
for
a
very
good
reason
the
statutory
language
is
entirely
different
and
without
the
vital,
the
all-important
cross-references.
now
a
moment
more
about
legislative
history
if
legislative
history
should
be
relevant
here.
in
the
original
briefs
of
the
government
they
cited
us
three
cases
saying
that
we
should
look
back
from
one
congress,
the
congress
in
1975
to
a
prior
congress
in
1974.
they
cited
two
cases.
in
our
briefs
we
showed
that
neither
of
those
cases
were
applicable.
now
they
come
along
with
the
danlaheight
case,
the
famous
texas
city
disaster
case
involving
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
in
that
case
this
court
considered
a
prior
legislative
report
to
the
congress
that
enacted
the
tort
claims
act.
but
why?
it
was
because
the
statute,
the
bill
in
the
prior
congress
was
exactly
the
same
and
the
legislative
report
was
exactly
the
same
word
for
word.
the
only
reason
they
leaped
forward
back
a
year
is
because
they
wanted
to
pick
up
some
testimony
with
respect
to
the
prior
bill
because
the
bill
that
was
actually
enacted
never
had
any
legislative
hearings.
therefore,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
had
absolutely
no
support
for
going
back
into
a
prior
congress
as
to
a
bill
that
was
never
enacted.
your
honors,
in
the
situation
the
government
would
have
us
look
at
here
we
had
a
bill
that
came
out
of
a
committee.
nothing
further
ever
happened
to
it.
it
was
never
referred
to
again
in
any
place.
the
danger
as
the
congressional
record
shows
is
of
doing
such
a
thing
as
that
aside
from
the
vacuum
that
we
are
looking
at
the
ways
and
means
committee
changed
51
percent
in
those
two
years
and
changed
in
chairmanship
from
chairman
mills
to
chairman
ullman.
next
we
would
respectfully
suggest--
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
--yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
they
had
a
provision
for
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
for
preserving
it.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
but...
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
in
that
regard,
but
again
without
the
transitional
or
shall
we
say
cross-referencing
langauge
that
picks
up
611
and
picks
up
613
in
that
manner.
your
honor,
it
is
to
show
that
it
is
before
this
court.
now
much
has
been
made
about
the
mechanical
difficulties.
principally
this
mechanical
difficulties
is
found
in
the
concurring
opinions
in
the
tax
court
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
application
of
the
statute.
we
respectfully
submit
those
mechanical
difficulties
are
wholly
illusory.
they
are
simply
not
there.
we
would
simply
apply
and
why
the
irs
did
it
i
cannot
understand
except
they
started
it
off
wrong.
they
would
simply
apply
the
same
technique
that
the
lessor
does
today
with
respect
to
cost
depletion.
in
other
words,
the
lessor
would
have
to
do
nothing
more
than
he
does
today
with
respect
to
cost
depletion
in
order
to
allocate
this
percentage
depletion
that
he
takes
on
his
bonus
over
the
actual
production
that
he
may
receive
in
the
future,
and
of
course
as
justice
white
pointed
out
if
there
is
no
production
in
the
future
the
percentage
depletion
evaporates.
so
the
mechanical
difficulties
as
all
of
the
commentators
have
pointed
out
are
simply
not
there.
may
i
add
with
respect
to
the
some
11
or
more
commentators
that
have
commented
on
the
cases
now
before
this
court
i
am
pleased
to
report
they
all
have
come
down
in
favor
of
the
taxpayers'
position.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
sir?
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
rather
it
be
on
our
side
than
on
the
other
side.
[laughter]
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
sir?
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
no,
sir.
i
cannot
say
that.
[laughter]
i
can
say
though
to
your
honor
that
about
half
of
them
are
practitioners
and
half
of
them
are
students.
but
i
would
say
the
students'
notes
are
very
lucid
and
well
done,
and
any
practicing
attorney
would
be
delighted
to
have
been
associated
with
them.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
lastly--
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
--no,
ma'am.
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
take
the
percentage
depletion
deduction
in
the
time
of
the
receipt
of
the
dollar.
it
is
possible
to
devise
a
method
to
take
the
deduction
at
a
later
period
of
time,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
teaching
of
the
herring
case
which
we
believe
is
still
vital
and
was
not
destroyed.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
with
all
deference,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
commissioner
when
the
commissioner
has
adopted
a
totally
erroneous
position
he
is
not
entitled
to
prevail.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
i
would
hope,
of
course,
the
court
would,
yes,
your
honor.
lastly,
we
would
respectfully
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
farmars
and
the
suggs
had
actual
production
during
the
year
of
the
receipt
of
their
bonus
and
so
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
they
cannot
combine
these
two
types
of
gross
incomes
from
the
property.
the
gross
income
that
is
truly
gross
income
from
the
property
in
the
form
of
a
bonus
and
the
dollars
they
receive
from
the
percentage
royalty,
i
put
the
two
together
and
take
their
percentage
depletion
upon
that.
you
can
easily
combine
them
and
see
whether
or
not
the
limitation
had
been
violated.
so,
therefore,
we
have
an
even,
simplistic
method
of
applying
the
statute.
what
the
taxpayers
here
are
suggesting
conform
with
all
of
the
decisions,
the
mosaic,
almost
grecian
mosaic
that
this
court
worked
out
with
respect
to
percentage
depletion
on
bonuses
over
a
very
long
period
of
time.
it
conforms
with
what
congress
intended
for
the
small
producer.
it
is
simple.
it
is
logical,
and
the
taxpayers
should
prevail.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
a
very
large
what,
sir?
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
yes,
sir,
but
then
it
would
have
to
be
spread
over
the
large
production
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly
in
the
later
years
and
it
would
immediately
violate
the
3000
or
2000
barrel
limit
and
you
would
immediately
in
the
next
year
restore
a
part
of
the
depletion
deduction
to
income.
in
other
words,
you
estimate
your
recoverable
reserves,
your
honor,
and
then
you
spread
that...
say
you
are
going
to
get
1000
barrels...
i
mean
a
million
since
we
are
dealing
with
big
figures
a
million
barrels
a
year
for
the
next
ten
years.
mr.
marvin
k.
collie
so
you
spread
your
bonus
over
that
ten
years
proportionately,
and
if
you
take
your
bonus
and
spread
it
to
the
next
year
and
see
how
many
dollars
you
are
getting
for
that
production
you
immediately
are
able
to
see
that
you
have
gone
over
in
the
second
year
your
2000
barrel
limitation
and
so
in
the
second
year
you
immediately
restore
the
depletion
you
took
in
the
first
year
back
to
income.
