unknown
speaker
that
is
they
could
not
see.
i
suppose
somebody
in
a
helicopter
could.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
not
asking
us
to
overrule
the
hester
case
then?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
that
much
about
the
facts
in
hester,
mr.
haddad?
it
is
just
that
very
kind
of
conclusory
statement
in
justice
holmes'
opinion.
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddad,
perhaps
this
varies
from
place
to
place
in
the
country,
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
putting
a
nc
hunting
sign
on
premises
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
owner
wishes
to
exclude
people
who
do
not
intend
to
hunt?
unknown
speaker
it
said
no
trespassing?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
comfort
do
you
draw
from
the
additional
conversation
about
hunting?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
might
out
the
other
way.
it
might
indicate
to
people
if
you
are
not
hunting
it
is
okay.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
that
is
true?
suppose
the
officers
had
come
up
here
to
this
sign
and
no
trespassing
but
they
see
some
marijuana
growing
right
inside
the
fence.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
plain
view
never
lets
you
into
a
private
place.
unknown
speaker
why?
there
is
a
no
trespassing
sign.
go
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
you
cannot
stand
outside
a
house
and
look
through
the
window
and
see
contraband
or
guns
lying
on
the
table
and
go
in
the
house
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
gun
would
be
in
plain
view
through
the
window
in
a
house.
can
you
enter
the
house
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
then
they
may
trespass?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
then
the
sign
does
not
mean
what
it
says.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
relying
upon
the
sign
to
give
you
an
expectation
of
privacy
apparently
it
does
not
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
field
can
have
some
expectation
of
privacy,
but
in
no
event
would
it
acquire
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
you
would
have
in
a
house
because
of
the
different
treatment
of
what
is
seen
in
plain
view
from
outside
the
field.
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make
that
this
could
have
been
seen
from
the
air?
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
police
helicopter
looking
for
marijuana?
unknown
speaker
mr.
haddad,
is
the
field
on
the
cumberland
river?
unknown
speaker
and
the
cumberland
is
navigable?
unknown
speaker
here
is
a
police
helicopter
flying
around
over
this
corn
field
or
over
this
marijuana
field
in
which
corn
was
growing,
one
or
the
other--
[laughter]
the
police
see
marijuana
growing.
they
then
radio
down
to
the
police
car
that
is
stopped
right
by
the
no
trespassing
sign.
may
the
police
then
go
right
on
into
the
corn
field?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
not
much
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
then
is
there
in
that
corn
field?
unknown
speaker
then
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
questions
we
were
putting
to
your
colleague
about
a
helicopter
or
a
light
plane
flying
over
the
area
taking
pictures
and
then
presenting
the
pictures
to
a
magistrate
with
enlargements
showing
that
there
were
marijuana
plants
and
getting
a
warrant.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
suggesting,
ms.
zeegler,
that
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court
decided
this
case
wholly
on
a
state
law
ground.
unknown
speaker
if
you
would
look
at
pages
a-12,
a-13,
a-14
in
the
petition
where
you
set
out
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
maine,
when
they
are
talking
about
expectation
of
privacy
they
first
talk
about
hester
and
katz
and
then
they
go
on
and
say
the
maine
cases
are
in
accord.
now
that
sounds
to
me
as
though
they
are
certainly
primarily
resting
it
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
unknown
speaker
weren't
the
maine
cases
in
turn
relying
on
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
all
we
can
do
here
is
decide
the
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
correct
that
the
decision
below
rested
as
well
on
maine,
the
ground
rule
would
still
prevail.
unknown
speaker
on
remand.
unknown
speaker
how
may
trees
do
you
need
to
get
rid
of
the
open
field?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
want
it
to
apply
to
anybody
but
a
field
of
this
type?
unknown
speaker
i
still
do
not
know
what
field
this
is.
i
do
not
know
how
many
trees
are
there.
unknown
speaker
how
close
are
the
trees?
unknown
speaker
but
you
could
see
them.
unknown
speaker
not
with
good
binoculars.
unknown
speaker
is
that
agreed
by
both
sides?
unknown
speaker
can
i
put
the
same
question
i
put
to
your
friend
in
the
other
case?
suppose
an
inspection
of
the
property
from
a
helicopter
and
they
got
down
low
enough
to
see
through
these
trees
and
they
saw
marijuana.
could
they
radio
out
to
a
police
car
at
the
edge
of
the
property
and
could
the
officers
in
the
car
then
walk
onto
the
property
and
inspect
further?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
am
asking.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
it
wasn't.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
could
the
officers
nevertheless
enter
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
asking
you
could
the
officers
at
the
edge
of
the
property
when
they
received
the
information
from
the
helicopter
could
the
officers
then
enter
the
property
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
what
privacy
there
is
has
already
disappeared.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
not
any
privacy
from
the
police.
the
police
would
already
know
exactly
what
is
on
the
property.
why
shouldn't
it
be
considered
an
open
field
then?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
an
open
field
when
a
helicopter
takes
a
picture
or
observes
it
and
concludes
that
that
is
marijuana.
is
it
not
then
an
open
field?
unknown
speaker
that
pretty
well
leaves
out
the
whole
state
of
maine
doesn't
it?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down,
could
i
ask
you
are
you
familiar
with
mr.
haddad's
case
in
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
your
facts
are
a
little
weaker
than
his
facts?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
believe
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
court
said
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
sounds
like
some
property
to
me.
i
say,
when
you
name
the
four
things
some
of
them
are
property
rights.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
that
there
is
substantial
property
law
involved
in
determining
whether
there
is
this
expectation
of
privacy
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
no
yard
or
other
adjacent
area
could
in
your
view
ever
be
made
so
as
to
invoke
fourth
amendment
concerns?
unknown
speaker
but
no
other
part
of
a
field
or
a
farm
or
a
piece
of
property
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
the
entry
is
legal?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
owner
of
the
property
is
there
at
the
gate,
and
the
officers
say
this
is
an
open
field
and
we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
there
is
marijuana
down
at
the
end
of
that
path
and
the
owner
says
awfully
sorry
but
you
can't
come
on?
may
they
forcibly
enter?
unknown
speaker
they
would
just
be
in
trouble
with
maine
but
not
with
the
federal
government.
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
your
view
there
is
just
nothing
a
land
owner
can
do
outside
the
house
to
invoke
fourth
amendment
protections
which
i
take
it
is
the
answer
you
gave
justice
o'connor
a
minute
ago.
if
the
land
owner
himself
out
there
with
a
gun
cannot
keep
them
out
or
cannot
create
any
expectation
of
privacy,
nothing
can.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
also
that
doesn't
even
require
probable
cause
as
i
understand
you.
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
even
require
reasonable
suspicion.
the
officer
could
just
go
up
and
say
we
are
not
sure.
there
might
be
marijuana
here.
we
are
going
to
search.
they
can
do
it.
unknown
speaker
is
your
position
consistent
do
you
think
with
some
of
the
administrative
search
cases
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
your
position
doesn't
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
an
officer
could...
the
land
owner
is
standing
at
the
gate.
the
officer
says
"we
think
there
is
some
contraband
sitting
down
there
at
the
end
of
this
path
or
some
evidence
or
something.
"
the
land
owner
says,
"well,
you
can't
come
on.
"
you
say
that
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
the
officer
may
enter
but
then
he
may
search,
but
may
he
seize?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
certainly
is
an
interest
in
what
is
being
seized
different
from
the
interest
in
the
land.
unknown
speaker
except
that
then
if
you
are
legally
there
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned
the
items
are
in
plain
sight
then
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
supposing
the
items
were
buried
so
there
is
a
gun
buried
in
the
field
somewhere
and
they
suspect
and
they
go
out
and
they
dig
for
it.
couldn't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
as
soon
as
they
saw
it
they
would
have
their
probable
cause
and
they
could
seize
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
but
the
constitution
would
not
impose
any
obstacle
to
going
into
a
property
and
digging
around
looking
for
a
gun
or
body
or
anything
like
that.
unknown
speaker
your
position--
--mr.
attorney
general,
what
do
you
do
with
the
word...
what
effect
do
you
give
to
the
word
"effects"
in
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
personal.
i
said
effects.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
doesn't
to
me.
it's
my
property.
unknown
speaker
you
only
apply
it
to
the
personal
property
but
not
the
real
property.
that
is
your
position?
unknown
speaker
give
me
any
case
that
says
that.
unknown
speaker
give
me
a
case
that
says
that
effects
means
personal
property
and
does
not
mean
real
property.
unknown
speaker
hester
did
not
say
one...
all
it
said
was
in
one
sentence
that
it
applies
to
the
house
and
does
not
apply
to
open
fields.
that
is
all
hester
says.
unknown
speaker
i
would
like
for
you
to
show
me
that.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
fifty-seven
is
the
page--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
the
last
paragraph.
unknown
speaker
period.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
anything
about
what
an
open
field
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
that
that
does
not
help
you.
he
could
have
meant
what?
he
could
have
meant
an
open
field
was
a
forest.
it
is
your
position
i
take
it
that
when
justice
holmes
said
open
field
he
did
not
mean
a
ten
by
ten
flower
garden
or
a
vegetable
garden
in
a
lot
that
is
100
feet
by
200
feet.
he
is
talking
about
something
larger.
unknown
speaker
name
me
something
in
the
opinion
that
gives
you
the
idea
that
he
meant
something
larger,
the
word
"larger".
it
is
not
in
there.
it
just
says
open
field,
and
i
interpret
open
field
to
mean
one
block,
one
acre
or
87
square
miles.
all
could
be
open
field.
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
apply
this
only
to
an
open
field.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
it
applies
only
to
a
house?
unknown
speaker
what
further
than
the
house?
unknown
speaker
what
more
than
the
house?
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
like
a
telephone
booth--
unknown
speaker
--a
barn?
unknown
speaker
the
common
law
lumped
together
is
the
curtilage?
unknown
speaker
would
the
barn's
location
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
within
the
curtilage
arguably
it
could,
but
suppose
it
were
a
mile
away
from
the
home?
unknown
speaker
wherever
located?
unknown
speaker
personalized?
unknown
speaker
personalized
barn?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
a
barn
is
personalized.
unknown
speaker
people
can
buy
houses
and
conduct
illegal
activity
in
them,
too.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
your
argument
that
they
could
use
it
illegally
i
do
not
know
that
that
advances
the
inquiry,
does
it,
because
every
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
could
be
used
for
illegal
purposes.
unknown
speaker
a
yard
house,
a
barn,
a
stable,
whatever
it
might
be.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests
in
the
question
in
the
earlier
case
if
enough
illegal
activities
are
conducted
in
the
house
it
may
turn
into
a
place
of
business.
unknown
speaker
the
pine
trees
look
much
the
same.
unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
would
it
matter
under
your
submission
even
if
it
were
totally
secluded
and
secondly
even
if
you
had
no
suspicion
your
position
still
is
the
same
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
unknown
speaker
either
there
is
total
expectation
of
privacy...
you
say
that
is
not
to
be
considered
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
total
objective
or
subjective?
as
i
understand
your
position
it
is
wholly
immaterial.
unknown
speaker
you
build
a
very
high
fence
around
and
electrify
it.
you
can
make
sure
that
no
human
being
can
get
in
it--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
still
open
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
enough,
just
the
fact
that
it
is
open
to
visual
inspection
from
the
air
is
enough
to
destroy
whatever
other
expectation
of
privacy
there
might
be.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
so
would
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
from
maine
that...
say
the
owner
is
there
at
the
gate
and
says,
"this
sign
means
exactly
what
it
says
and
this
path
is
not
open
to
the
public.
"
"now
just
stay
out.
"
"i
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
and
i
am
now
enforcing
it.
"
could
the
officers
then
enter?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
did.
he
is.
he
is
standing
there
and
he
says
"if
you
are
going
to
come
on
you
will
have
to
force
your
way
on.
"
unknown
speaker
with
or
without
an
expectation
of
privacy?
i
mean
with
or
without
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
it
is
terribly
important
because
as
soon
as
you
say
that
you
are
acknowledging
the
fourth
amendment
has
some
application.
i
thought
your
position
was
it
had
no
application.
unknown
speaker
your
primary
submission
is
that
you
need
reasonable
suspicion--
unknown
speaker
--like
maine's
submission.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
first
position.
unknown
speaker
aren't
there
some
areas
of
this
country
where
you
could
have
fence
riders
with
authority
to
shoot
anybody
who
passes
the
fence?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
the
government
be
a
little
more
straightforward
in
its
position?
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
anything...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
you
answer
the
questions
so
far
indicate
that
the
government
has
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
as
to
exactly
what
its
position
is.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
restriction
at
all.
that
is
what
worries
me.
you
say
that
a
police
officer
can
go
on
anybody's
land
at
any
time
under
any
circumstances
for
anything.
you
certainly
cannot
mean
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
just
from
an
unidentified
informant?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
an
anonymous
tip
over
the
telephone
is
always
reasonable
suspicion?
unknown
speaker
do
they
need
more
suspicion
for
that
than
to
go
into
a
barn?
say
they
were
told
there
was
a
kidnap
victim
in
a
barn.
what
rule
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
it
is
unlikely
that
the
kidnap
victim
is
going
to
be
out
in
the
open.
it
is
more
likely
to
be
in
a
structure.
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
acknowledge
that
there
the
fourth
amendment
applies.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
seem
to
me
your
kidnap
victim
argument
helps
you
very
much.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
stay
with
the
barn.
does
it
make
sense
to
keep
them
out
of
a
barn
without
some
kind
of
either
probable
cause
or
a
warrant
or
something
like
that?
what
is
your
view
of
the
law
on
kidnap
victims
in
barns?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
higher
than
the
open
field?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
higher
than
the
open

unknown
speaker
mr.
horowitz,
do
you
accept
or
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
the
state
of
maine
that
there
has
to
be
a
personalized
interest?
your
brief
does
not
indicate
that
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
explanation
was
that
there
had
to
have
some
relationship
to
people
as
perhaps
indicated
by
katz,
and
if
you
had
a
farm
or
a
piece
of
property
100
miles
from
your
residence
that
one
elaborately
fenced
and
posted
and
grew
marijuana
on
it
that
i
would
think
there
would
be
no
personalized
interest
in
that
beyond
protecting
one
from
crime.
as
i
read
your
brief
you
say
that
if
you
take
adequate
precautions
wherever
the
property
is
located
and
wholly
without
regard
to
any
personal
interest
that
the
fourth
might
apply.
why
do
you
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
a
building
would
not
be
an
open
field.
unknown
speaker
hester
rather
cryptic
did
make
any
exception
to
whether
some
effort
had
been
made
to
conceal
or
obstruct
the
entry
of
the
open
field
did
it?
unknown
speaker
in
hester.
unknown
speaker
what
about
somebody
like
thoreau
who
goes
up
to
waldon
pond
and
simply
lives
in
a
little
are
right
around
there.
he
just
not
only
grows
things
but
that
is
where
he
sleeps
at
night.
that
is
where
he
eats
his
meals.
do
you
think
if
he
put
a
fence
up
around
that--
unknown
speaker
--no?
unknown
speaker
this
court
has
never
extended
that
to
open
fields.
that
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
assume
all
that.
the
magistrate
himself
if
you
want
or
at
least
a
prosecuting
attorney
takes
the
pictures,
supervises
them
and
they
are
unquestioned.
now
that
is
enough
to
get
a
warrant
is
it?
unknown
speaker
there
is
another
proposition
announced
in
a
good
many
opinions
that
the
knowledge
of
one
officer
involved
in
an
operation
is
the
knowledge
of
all.
unknown
speaker
i
take
justice
white's
hypothetical.
the
man
in
the
light
airplane
or
helicopter
is
an
expert
on
foliage
and
he
says
this
is
marijuana,
and
they
radio
that
down
to
the
officers
who
then
move
in
without
a
warrant.
is
that
okay?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
your
position.
