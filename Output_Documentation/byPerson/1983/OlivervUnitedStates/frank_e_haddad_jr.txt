mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
police
without
a
warrant,
probable
cause
or
exigent
circumstances
searched
the
petitioner
oliver's
farm
and
found
marijuana
growing
in
a
corn
field.
oliver
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
district
court.
that
motion
was
sustained.
a
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
on
petition
for
rehearing
en
band
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
per
se
open
fields
doctrine
permitted
the
state
police
to
conduct
the
open
field
search,
and
that
holding
by
the
sixth
circuit
was
contrary
to
the
position
of
seven
other
circuits
who
have
rejected
the
per
se
open
fields
doctrine
as
well
as
most
of
other
state
courts--
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court's
decision
in
katz
decided
in
1967
holding
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
an
individual
if
he
has
an
actual
and
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
modified
the
per
se
open
fields
doctrine
to
the
extent
of
regarding
a
search
warrant
or
requiring
a
search
warrant
for
the
search
of
a
highly
secluded
field
from
whence
the
public
is
excluded
and
where
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is
shown
to
exist
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
a
police
officer,
a
kentucky
state
police
officer,
received
an
anonymous
tip
and
based
on
that
anonymous
tip,
the
anonymous
tip
being
that
these
was
marijuana
being
grown
on
the
oliver
farm.
based
on
that
tip
he
and
another
police
officer
without
a
search
warrant
and
without
probable
cause
and
without
having
any
exigent
circumstances
proceeded
to
mr.
oliver's
farm.
mr.
oliver's
farm
has
proved
to
have
been
22
miles
from
the
nearest
town
in
a
very,
very
remote
area
of
kentucky.
to
get
to
the
field
that
they
ultimately
found
the
marijuana
growing
in
it
was
necessary
for
the
police
officers
to
enter
mr.
oliver's
property,
drive
several
hundred
yards
to
his
house
and
then
continue
driving
nearly
another
mile
into
the
property.
during
this
travel
according
to
mr.
oliver
and
there
is
some
dispute
about
the
number,
but
there
were
a
number
of
posted
no
trespassing
signs.
they
traveled
on
beyond
the
house
as
i
say
for
another
mile
when
they
came
upon
a
locked
gate
blocking
the
roadway.
this
locked
gate
also
had
on
it
a
no
trespassing
sign.
the
officers
parked
their
car
not
being
able
to
go
beyond
that
gate
in
the
car
and
walked
around
the
gate.
this
area
was
fenced
within
the
farm
and
the
proof
is
that
the
farm
had
boundary
fences
around
it
as
well.
after
going
past
this
gate
or
walking
around
this
gate
they
proceeded
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
when
someone
yelled
to
them,
"come
back.
"
"there
is
no
hunting
allowed
in
this
property.
"
the
officers
walked
back
to
the
barn
on
the
camp
or
where
this
person
was
standing
and
they
could
not
find
the
person
that
they
had
seen
who
yelled
at
them.
so
they
proceeded
on
for
another
approximate
quarter
of
a
mile
until
they
get
into
the
property
to
the
field
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half.
they
traveled
on
that
last
journey,
that
last
quarter
mile
journey,
they
travelled
apart
of
that
way
through
very
dense
underbrush
and
very
dense
wooded
area.
they
finally
came
upon
the
corn
field
and
they
could
only
when
they
got
to
that
corn
field
observe
that
marijuana
was
growing
in
the
corn
field.
they
could
not
see
that
marijuana
from
any
other
position
until
they
had
driven
back
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
and
stood
actually
on
the
field
or
in
the
field.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
yes,
they
could.
the
situation
that
we
have
here
is
that
the
officers
after
finding
this
marijuana
they
came
back
out
and
while
traveling
on
the
road
they
saw
mr.
oliver
and
ultimately
arrested
him
and
charged
him
with
manufacturing
and
growing
marijuana
in
violation
of
the
federal
statute
that
was
involved.
the
holding
in
katz
and
many
cases
before
the
katz
case
was
that
searches
conducted
outside
the
judicial
process
without
prior
approval
by
a
magistrate
were
per
se
unreasonable
subject
to
a
few
well
delineated
exceptions.
the
government
in
this
case
contends
that
the
open
fields
doctrine
is
the
exception
in
this
case,
that
this
search
should
be
held
legal.
our
contention
is
that
since
oliver
excluded
the
public...
the
distinctions
we
will
make
in
a
moment...
this
was
not
an
open
field
since
he
had
excluded
the
public
and
took
such
precautions
as
i
have
outlined
to
exclude
everyone
from
it.
the
definition
of--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--no,
sir.
the
definition
of
open
fields
has
changed
through
the
years.
in
hester
the
court
held
that
the
police
could
search
in
an
area
from
which
they
are
not
excluded.
there
are
other
views
of
hester
holding
that
it
is
a
per
se
open
fields
doctrine.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
you
are
correct
in
that,
but
there
was
a
holding
there
or
some
holding
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
himself
is
who
led
the
police
to
the
evidence
by
passing
the
jugs
of
whiskey
to
the
other
person
that
was
on
the
property
at
the
time
which
the
officers
were
able
to
observe.
they
also
held
in
that
case
that
there
were
other
people
who
came
onto
and
off
of
the
property
even
while
the
officers
were
there
and
after
the
arrest
had
been
made.
so
we
next
come
to
the
olmstead
case
about
four
years
later
when
there
was
a
holding
that
has
been
referred
to
as
the
per
se
locational
theory,
and
that
was
that
anything
outside
of
the
curtilage
was
considered
to
be
an
open
field
and
no
warrant
was
needed.
in
the
katz
decision
this
court
rejected
the
olmstead's
per
se
theory
of
the
open
field
doctrine,
and
in
more
recent
cases
since
katz
the
holding
has
been
that
a
field
is
not
open
if
the
public
was
excluded.
in
the
air
pollution
variance
board
v.
western
alfalfa
case
decided
in
1974
the
court
analyzed
that
a
federal
agent
can
trespass
onto
an
area
where
the
public
is
not
excluded
and
view
that
which
was
exposed
to
the
public
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
so
they
held
that
if
the
public
was
not
excluded
the
area
was
an
open
field,
and
in
that
case
they
held,
which
was
an
osha
warrantless
search
case,
they
held
that
the
search
was
okay
and
legal.
in
marshall
v.
barlow
a
few
years
later,
some
four
years
later,
this
court
using
the
same
analysis
held
that
without
a
warrant
the
government
agent
is
in
no
better
position
that
a
member
of
the
public
and
observations
capable
of
being
made
by
the
public
can
be
made
by
the
agent
without
a
warrant.
in
that
case
the
court
held
as
unconstitutional
the
authorization
under
the
osha
act
or
search
without
a
warrant
because
it
permitted
a
warrantless
government
agent
to
search
in
an
area
where
the
public
was
excluded.
so
we
get
into
that
fine
distinction
that
this
court
has
made
that
if
the
public
was
excluded
the
area
is
not
an
open
field.
if
the
area
is
not
an
open
field
then
the
fourth
amendment
applies.
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies
then
we
must
use
the
two-part
katz
test
to
determine
if
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
violated.
when
we
look
at
the
first
part
of
the
katz
test
which
is
was
there
an
expectation
of
privacy
we
find
in
this
particular
case
that
this
man
had
his
property
fenced.
he
had
it
posted
throughout
with
no
trespassing
signs.
he
had
a
gate
to
the
road
which
had
a
chain
and
lock
on
it.
there
was
a
travel
back
into
the
farm
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
into
a
secluded
area
through
wooded
areas
to
find
the
marijuana
growing
in
the
corn
field.
there
was
also
the
additional,
which
the
sixth
circuit
dissenting
opinion
put
a
lot
of
weight
upon...
there
was
also
the
additional
fact
that
somebody
on
the
property
had
hollered
to
the
police
officers
that
no
hunting
was
allowed
and
to
come
back
or
to
come
back,
no
hunting
was
allowed.
so
when
we
apply
that
and
as
the
district
court
judge
said
in
his
memorandum...
opinion,
short
of
guards
at
the
entrance
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
else
the
defendant
could
have
done
to
assert
his
privacy
interest
in
the
property--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--this
was
a
no
trespassing
signs
throughout
here.
it
is
the
same
i
would
imagine
as
no
hunting,
but
it
said
no
trespassing.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
yes,
sir.
all
of
them
said
no
trespassing.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
none
except
that
i
felt
that...
the
sixth
circuit
dissenting
opinion
felt
that
that
was
something
added
to
show
that
there
was
an
expectation
of
privacy
when
someone
on
the
property
yelled,
"come
back.
"
"there
is
no
hunting
allowed
on
the
property.
"
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so,
not
with
the
clear
delineation
of
all
of
these
signs
on
the
property
and
particularly
with
one
on
that
locked
gate
that
said
no
trespassing.
the
government
really
does
not
realize
the
significance
of
a
no
trespassing
sign
in
that
rural
area
of
kentucky.
it
means
just
what
it
says,
no
trespassing,
and
the
society
in
the
second
part
of
the
katz
test
was
was
this
expectation
of
privacy
one
that
society
is
prepared
to
accept
as
reasonable.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
that
would
be
plain
view,
your
honor,
and
that
would
be
an
exception.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
it
would
in
this
instance
i
am
afraid.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
but
if
it
comes--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--i
agree
with
your
honor,
but
if
this
were
in
plain
view
then
the
open
fields--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--no,
sir.
but
the
point
is
that
if
this
were
in
a
place
where
the
public
could
observe
it
then
it
is
an
open
field.
if
it
was
a
place
where
the
public
could
observe
it
without
trespassing
in
this
situation
then
it
would
be--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--well,
it
is
an
exception.
it
is
another
exception
to
the
rule.
it
does
not
permit
the
trespassing.
it
permits--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--no,
sir.
i
disagree,
sir.
the
sign
means
exactly
what
it
says,
no
trespassing.
if
you
see
something...
you
could
not
see
it
in
this
case.
everybody
agrees
and
the
government
stipulates--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--i
am
not
depending
upon
the
sign
alone
as
the
government
would
have
the
court
believe
in
their
brief.
we
are
depending
upon
all
of
these
circumstances
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
--exactly.
i
think
that
is
where
your
hester
case
comes
back
into
play,
and
it
would
permit
the
search
if
it
was
visible
to
the
public
or
from
an
area
where
the
public
was.
then
whether
there
is
trespassing
signs
or
not
you
could
go
onto
the
property
and
seize
that
in
the
plain
view
doctrine.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
well,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
at
all
in
this
case
because
if
it
can
be
seen
and
the
air
searches
have
been
held
legal
because
the
air
is
a
place
where
the
public
is
expected
to
be
traveling
in
the
air
over
commercial
planes
or
in
private
planes
or
in
anything
else.
that
would
be
permissible.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
it
would
be
permissible
and
the
cases
have
so
held,
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
the
cumberland
is
navigable
but
there
was
a
stipulation
entered
into
this
record
by
the
government
and
the
defense
attorney
that
this
property,
these
particular
fields
could
not
be
observed
from
the
cumberland
river.
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
would
have
right
at
that
point
under
the
open
fields
doctrine
because
any
member
of
the
public
could
do
the
same
thing,
could
fly
around
in
the
air
in
a
helicopter
and
observe
that.
mr.
frank
e.
haddad,
jr.
there
is
for
people
who
walk
onto
the
ground
where
there
are
no
trespassing
signs
and
all
these
other
things.
the
second
part
of
the
katz
test
is
whether
or
not
society...
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
one
that
society
is
prepared
to
accept
as
reasonable.
we
say
that
it
is.
certainly
society
is
ready
to
accept
as
reasonable
a
farmer's
right
to
exclude
other
people
from
his
property,
and
certainly
there
could
be
a
valid
presumption
that
a
reasonable
presumption
exists
that
society
would
not
favor
warrantless
government
intrusions.
thank
you.
