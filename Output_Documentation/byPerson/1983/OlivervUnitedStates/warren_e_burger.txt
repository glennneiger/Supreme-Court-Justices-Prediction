ms.
zeegers,
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
it
isn't
very
often
that
sensitive
constitutional
questions
can
be
resolved
by
use
of
modern
technology,
but
did
i
understand
you
to
indicate
that
if
a
helicopter
or
a
light
plane
went
over
and
took
one
of
these
very
sensitive
pictures
conclusively
showing
that
it
was
marijuana
and
took
that
to
the
magistrate
that
a
warrant
could
properly
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
