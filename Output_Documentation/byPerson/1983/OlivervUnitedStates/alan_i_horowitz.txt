mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
relevant
facts
in
the
oliver
case
can
be
stated
quite
simply.
acting
on
information
that
petitioner
was
growing
marijuana
on
his
farm
police
drove
up
a
road
onto
the
farm.
when
a
gate
which
contained
a
no
trespassing
sign
blocked
that
road
they
continued
unobstructed
on
foot
on
a
frequently
used
path
around
the
gate
and
then
down
the
road
until
they
reached
the
marijuana
field.
it
is
not
disputed
that
the
marijuana
was
not
discovered
until
the
officers
were
on
petitioner's
property,
but
it
is
well
settled
that
that
fact
alone
does
not
require
suppression
on
fourth
amendment
grounds.
the
notion
that
somehow
the
area
was
particularly
secluded
and
that
there
was
dense
underbrush
is
not
really
supported
by
the
record.
the
police
here
just
walked
down
the
road
which
is
exactly
what
the
information
had
told
them
where
the
marijuana
would
be--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
to
the
extent
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes.
to
the
extent
that
the
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
of
the
owner
enters
into
it
the
fact
that
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
reach
helps
them
to
some
extent.
our
position
is
that
in
an
area
like
this
there
is
still
not
a
warrant
requirement,
that
the
privacy
expectation
is
not
there.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
total
subjective
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
do
not
think
you
can
ever
have
a
total
subjective
or
objective
expectation
of
privacy
in
an
area
like
a
field.
i
mean
there
is
always
going
to
be
access.
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
access
is
going
to
be
more
difficult
or
less
difficult.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
would
still
open--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it
is
still
open
because
it
still
does
not
have
walls
and
it
still
does
not
have
a
roof
so
it
is
still
open
to
view
from
the
air.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
that
is
the
state
of
law
as
it
is
now.
i
mean--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--we
have
two
positions.
we
suggest
that
at
some
point
a
person
can
take
sufficient
measures
to
exclude
outsiders.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
certainly
if
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
they
could
enter.
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
would
think
that
he
really
has
to
take
exclusionary
measures--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--again
i
get
back
to
that
we
have
two
positions.
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
the
officer
from
going
on
to
the
land
at
that
point
because
it
is
still
an
open
field.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
but
certainly
with
reasonable
suspicious.
i
mean
i
can
understand--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
again
as
i
say
i
think
we
have
two
positions.
i
think
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
is
now
is
that
these
fields
are
open.
fourth
amendment
protections
do
not
extend
to
these
fields,
and
it
is
not
a
search
when
police
officers
go
onto
these
fields.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
our
primary
submission.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
that
is
our
first
position,
but
even--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
am
not
aware
if
the
law
supports
any
authority
to
shoot
anyone
for
crossing
a
fence.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
see
i
am
not
making
myself
clear.
it
is
our
position
that
fourth
amendment
protections
do
not
extend
to
these
areas,
but
we
recognize
the
possibility
that
at
least
where
the
land
owner
takes
some
serious
measures
to
protect
those
areas
and
to
create
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
those
areas
that
the
court
might
disagree
and
the
court
might
take
the
view
that
there
should
be
some
fourth
amendment
protection
for
those
areas.
in
that
event
it
is
still
our
position
that
these
areas
can
never
have
the
sort
of
protection
that
is
granted
by
the
warrant
clause
and
the
probable
cause
requirement
and
at
a
minimum
the
police
must
be
able
to
enter
when
they
have
reasonable
suspicion.
i
think
that
that
position
only
makes
common
sense...
the
consequences
of
enforcing
the
warrant
clause
requirements
here
are
just...
there
are
just
too
many
cases
where
any
balancing
of
fourth
amendment
values
would
suggest
that
the
police
ought
to
be
able
to
enter
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
enter.
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
where
kids
have
gone
onto
the
fields
to
hunt
or
fish
or
something
and
come
back
and
report
to
the
police
that
there
is
a
marijuana
patch
growing
or
something
that
might
be
a
marijuana
patch
growing.
it
just
does
not
make
any
sense
that
the
policeman
cannot
follow
these
kids
back
onto
the
yard
where
they
had
just
been
unless
he
has
probable
cause
and
a
warrant.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
first
of
all,
there
is
certainly
a
practical
restriction.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
restriction
that
is
constitutionally
required.
there
is
a
practical
restriction
in
that
the
police
do
not...
i
do
not
know
how
many
trillions
and
trillions
of
acres
of
open
fields
in
this
country.
the
police
do
not
have
time
to
go
tramping
through
them.
in
almost
all
the
cases
you
see
cited
involving
the
open
fields
doctrine
the
police
only
go
on
the
fields
because
they
have
a
reason
because
someone
has
suggested
to
them.
so
there
is
a
built
in
safeguard
for
that.
i
do
not
think
the
fourth
amendment
itself
extends
any
protection
to
these
areas.
if
the
warrant
clause
applied
here
and
even
if
the
police
had
gotten
some
tip,
let's
say
something
that
does
not
amount
to
probable
cause.
if
they
had
a
tip
that
there
was
a
body
buried
in
the
corner
of
a
field
or
if
there
is
a
kidnap
victim
being
held
in
a
field
then
they
could
not
go
on
without
getting
a
warrant
and
they
would
not
be
able
to
get
a
warrant
because
they
did
not
have
probable
cause.
they
would
have
to
sit
on
their
hands
and
do
nothing.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
was
an
anonymous
tip.
we
do
not
know
that
much
about
exactly
what
there
was,
but--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
were
told
in
this
case
that
there
was
an
anonymous
tip.
it
was
fairly
specific.
it
told
them
exactly
where
the
field
was
at
the
end
of
the
road,
and
although
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
it
was
the
record
also
says
that
this
was
corroborated
by
other
information
the
officers
had
that
they
had
heard
other
reports
in
the
community.
so
i
guess
what
they
had
was
several
anonymous
tips.
i
think
from
what
we
know
about
it
it
seems
like
reasonable
suspicion.
i
think
the
police
have
to
be
able
to
go
onto
a
field
in
a
case
like
that
where
they
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
there
is
a
kidnap
victim
or
a
body
buried
there
or
something.
now
if
they
got
the
same
information
for--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--a
barn
is
an
area
certainly--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--possibly.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
the...
well,
depending
on
what
sort
of
barn
it
is,
but
if
it
is
a
really
enclosed
structure--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
there
is
a
lot
of
important
evidence
that
may
be
found
in
a
field
and
that
the
police
may
get
information
that
will
be
found
in
a
field.
it
just
does
not
make
any
sense
to
keep
them
off.
now
maybe
in
the
case
of
a
barn
but
certainly
in
the
case
of
a
house
they
have
got
the
same
sort
of
information--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
might
be
a
lesser...
that
a
barn
is
not
a
house
and
there
might
be
a
lesser
standard.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
sorry?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
so.
in
the
hypothetical
i
pose
if
they
have
the
same
information
for
a
house
obviously
they
could
not
go
into
a
house.
that
is
established.
you
need
a
warrant
and
probable
cause
to
go
into
a
house.
i
think
that
illustrates
why
fields
are
so
different
here.
the
reason
why
you
need
a
warrant
and
probable
cause
to
go
into
a
house
is
because
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned
about
protecting
certain
privacy
interests
that
individuals
have.
those
are
the
innocent
privacy
interests,
not
so
much
protection
against
being
discovered
while
they
are
committing
a
crime.
it
is
recognized
that
there
are
very
serious
privacy
interests
that
are
always
involved
in
people's
homes.
any
intrusion
into
the
home
is
going
to
involve
an
intrusion
into
those
sort
of
interests.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
am
not
sure
i
completely
understand
what
that
means.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
ordinary
precautions
that
farm
owners
take
we
do
not
think
are
sufficient
to
implicate
any
fourth
amendment
interest.
fencing
and
posting
a
field
i
do
not
think
is
enough
to
really
exclude
people,
and
it
is
not
enough
to
create
an
interest.
if
they
take
very
elaborate
precautions
to
keep
people
off
then
there
might
be
some.
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
building
a
building
certainly
creates
some
expectation
of
privacy
and
some
fourth
amendment
interest.
i
do
not
know
if
there
has
to
be
personalized--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
this
case?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
in
hester.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
i
do
not
think
so
and
to
talk
about
hester
for
a
minute
i
think
it
is
not
true
that
hester
does
not
have
to
be
overruled
or
at
least
substantially
modified
for
oliver
to
prevail
in
this
case.
the
facts
in
hester
are
that
the
police
knew
that
they
were
on
hester's
property
and
the
record
although
it
is
not
reflected
in
the
opinion
but
the
record
suggests
that
they
climbed
over
one
or
two
fences
to
get
there
so
i
do
not
know
that
that
case
is
very
different
from
this
one.
i
think
the
court's
decision
there
reflects
a
common
sense
understanding
that
these
sorts
of
places
are
not
really
in
a
practical
sense
restricted
from
outsiders
and
if
people
are
going
to
do
things
in
those
fields
they
are
exposing
them
to
some
extent
to
be
seen
by
other
people
and
the
police
have
the
same
rights
that
the
other
people
do
to
see
these
things.
i
think
it
is
important...
the
fourth
amendment
to
some
extent
is
a
matter
of
probabilities,
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
that.
even
the
warrant
clause
recognizes
the
possibility
that
police
may
make
an
unjustified
intrusion
into
a
private
area
if
police
get
a
warrant
on
probable
cause.
in
some
not
insignificant
percentage
of
those
cases
their
suspicion
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
unfounded,
and
they
are
going
to
make
an
intrusion
into
the
home
that
invades
serious
privacy
interests
and
that
is
not
warranted
by
law
enforcement
interests.
that
is
the
reason
we
have
the
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirement
to
minimize
those
entries
as
much
as
possible.
now
in
the
case
of
a
field
it
just
does
not
make
sense
to
have
the
same
sort
of
requirements
because
there
is
very
little
privacy
value
in
what
goes
on
in
a
field.
people
just
do
not
engage
in
the
sort
of
private
matters
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
intended
to
be
directed
at
when
they
are
out
in
their
fields.
so
let's
assume
the
police
go
onto
a
field
with
less
suspicion.
let's
say
they
have
only
5
percent
reason
to
think
that
there
is
marijuana
in
the
field
and
in
95
percent
of
the
entries
they
turn
out
to
be
wrong,
but
in
those
95
percent
of
the
entries
they
do
not
see
anything
except
cows
and
corn
and
trees.
it
does
not
really
matter
so
it
just
does
not
make
sense
to
erect
this
kind
of
barrier
which
is
going
to
have
a
serious
impact
on
law
enforcement
to
protect
what
is
basically
a
theoretical
privacy
interest
or
one
that
is
going
to
exist
in
only
very
unusual
cases.
i
would
also
like
to
talk
briefly
about
looking
at
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
the
land
owner.
i
think
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
very
strong
for
an
expectation
of
privacy.
the
police
walked
directly
onto
the
field
without
any
barrier.
the
idea
that
the
no
trespassing
sign
somehow
creates
a
significant
expectation
of
privacy
i
think
just
does
not
accord
with
reality.
the
stipulation
in
this
case
was
that
there
was
a
no
trespassing
sign
when
the
officers
left
the
highway
and
entered
into
the
beginning
of
mr.
oliver's
farm.
this
was
even
before
they
came
to
the
house.
