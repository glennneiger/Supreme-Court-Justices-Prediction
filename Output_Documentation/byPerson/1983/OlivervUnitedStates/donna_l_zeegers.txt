ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
state
of
maine
v.
richard
thornton
the
area
in
question
was
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
akin
to
an
open
field.
the
area
by
its
very
nature
of
being
a
heavily
wooded
area
was
not
akin
to
an
open
field.
it
was
not
a
field
for
one
thing,
and
it
was
not
open
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
if
you
will
look
at
the
information
in
this
case
starting
from
the
affidavit
by
the
police
officer
after
he
had
made
his
warrantless
search
they
made
reference
to
an
informant
here
who
had
told
about
marijuana
growing
in
back
of
someone's
trailer
home
in
a
heavily
wooded
area.
the
police
officer
said
in
the
affidavit
as
well
that
he
went
to
the
heavily
wooded
area
and
saw
what
he
wanted
to
see
and
then
asked
the
magistrate
to
give
him
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
heavily
wooded
area.
also
at
the
suppression
hearing
it
is
very
clear
from
the
record
that
the
area
searched
was
in
fact
woods
and
not
fields.
there
were
photographs.
an
aerial
photograph
in
particular
showed
that
the
complete
property
except
for
some
very
small
patches,
smaller
than
this
table,
were
in
fact
open.
the
rest
of
it
was
a
completely
heavily
wooded
area.
the
police
themselves
made
testimony
that
the
area
that
they
searched
was
heavily
wooded.
mrs.
thornton's
testimony,
the
defendant's
wife's
testimony,
was
also
that
the
area
was
heavily
wooded.
therefore,
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
should
be
free
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
determine
that
the
nature
of
the
particular
area
was
not
an
open
field.
it
was
in
fact
closed
woods
and
secluded
woods.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
feeling
on
that
would
be
that
if
they
made
an
aerial
search
that
may
have
been
enough
to
establish
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant.
well,
in
my
situation
it
may
have
been
difficult
to
in
fact
observe
marijuana
growing
because
the
patches
were
so
small
in
this
heavily
wooded
area.
perhaps
if
they
had
binoculars
they
might
have
been
able
to
see
them.
but
if
it
were
a
large
area
and
they
were
easily
seen,
then
that
would
have
been
enough
to
establish
probable
cause.
but
in
fact
there
would
be
not
a
privacy
violation
from
the
air
to
the
extent
of
the
privacy
violation
of
police
actually
coming
onto
your
property.
in
terms
of
the
individual's
expectations
the
individual
expects
that
people
are
not
going
to
come
onto
his
private
property,
but
the
individual
does
not
have
as
great
an
expectation
that
people
may
not
see
things
from
the
air.
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
is
no
definition
of
open
field
in
the
hester
case,
and
i
think
because
of
that
maine
certainly
should
be
free
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
area
searched
is
an
open
field
or
it
is
not
an
open
field.
it
is
important
to
note
also
that
the
maine
court
never
rejected
the
open
fields
doctrine
nor
did
they
reject
hester.
in
fact,
they
have
applied
the
open
fields
doctrine
in
cases
in
maine
and
they
cited
three
or
four
cases
in
the
opinion
where
the
open
fields
doctrine
had
been
applied
stating--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
do
feel
that
there
is
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds
for
this
decision,
and
the
reason
that
i
am
saying
that
is
because
the
state
of
maine
had
to
talk
about
federal
cases
because
they
had
to
correct
the
erroneous
assumptions
of
petitioner
in
the
case
regarding
the
application
of
katz
and
hester
to
this
case.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
well,
again,
your
honor,
it
is
my
position
that
the
court
had
to
discuss
hester
and
katz
because
those
were
the
cases
that
were
raised
by
the
petitioner
on
appeal
so
they
had
to
discuss
them,
but
then
they
said
we
are
in
accord
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
search.
then
the
court
cited
18
maine
cases
to
support
that
decision
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
search.
therefore,
the
federal
cases
if
they
were
used
other
than
just
to
correct
their
assumptions
they
were
used
only
as
guidance
in
maine
similarly
for
adopting
the--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--it
is
my
position
that
some
of
the
cases
did
cite
katz
but
not
all
of
them,
and
it
is
very
clear
from
the
face
of
the
opinion
that
the
court
did
adopt
its
own
version
of
a
search
and
did--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--that
is
right.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
that
is
correct.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
yes,
sure.
in
terms
of
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court's
holding
on
the
applicability
of
the
open
fields
doctrine
that
is
completely
in
accord
with
its
own
prior
decisions
and
with
decisions
of
this
court.
the
two
factual
circumstances
which
must
be
considered
in
maine
before
the
open
fields
doctrine
applies
are
the
openness
with
which
the
activity
is
pursued,
whether
the
activity
is
open
and
patent.
number
two,
the
lawfulness--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--well,
i
think
certainly
in
this
case
we
had
no
field
at
all.
there
were
only
trees
on
this
property,
and
it
is
significant
to
note
that
nobody
could
have
seen
these
tiny
patches
in
amongst
the
fields
from
any
other
land
other
than
the
defendant's
land.
they
could
also
not
been
seen
from
the
defendant's
driveway,
from
the
defendant's
house,
from
neighboring
land
or
from
the
road.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear
you.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
how
many
trees
are
there?
there
are
38
acres
of
trees
in
this
case.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
they
were
right
next
to
the
trees.
the
little
patches
were
right
next
to
the
trees.
the
trees
completely
surrounded
them.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
you
could
see
them
only
when
you
got
onto
the
land.
you
could
not
see
them
from
neighboring
land.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
not
with
good
binoculars
even.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
that
particular
issue
has
not
really
been
addressed.
i
have
been
on
the
property
myself
and
i
could
tell
you
that,
but
that
was
never
raised
in
the
lower
court.
in
terms
of
the
other
factual
aspect
for
the
applicability
of
the
open
fields
doctrine
was
the
lawfulness
of
the
officers'
presence
during
their
observation
of
what
is
open
and
patent,
whether
the
police
have
as
much
right
to
be
in
a
position
of
observation
as
the
defendant
or
the
public
and
whether
the
permission
was
given
or
whether
the
area
was
exposed
to
public
view.
it
is
important
to
note
that
petitioner
incorrectly
cites
the
holdings
on
this
issue
throughout
its
brief
and
then
uses
that
holding
as
a
foundation
for
saying
that
the
court
used
only
a
trespass
theory
in
coming
to
its
opinion.
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
case.
this
applicability
of
the
open
fields
doctrine
is
completely
in
accord
with
the
air
pollution
variance
board
case
where
the
open
fields
doctrine
was
applied
to
an
area
that
was
visible
to
the
public
and
from
which
the
public
was
not
excluded.
the
visibility
of
the
public
standard
in
air
pollution
is
as
same
as
the
openness
standard
in
maine
v.
thornton.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
well,
i
think
the
threshold
question
there
would
be
whether
or
not
there
was
a
search.
if
the--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--yes.
if
the
air
craft
was
so
low
as
to
violate
their
privacy
and--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--suppose
it
was
not?
then
it
would
be
held
not
to
be
a
search
and
they
could
have
enough
probable
cause--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--they
could
not
enter
the
property.
what
they
could
do
is
get
probable
cause
and
get
a
search
warrant.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
so
because
there
would
be
no
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
in
that
situation.
viewing
property
from
the
air
only
can
establish
probable
cause.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
because
the...
well,
number
one,
the
area
was
not
an
open
field.
the
state
court
addressed
that.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
well,
in
terms
of
what
the...
the
openness
of
course,
has
to
be
the
key
here,
and
in
maine
they
say
that
the
area
has
to
be
open
and
because
they
see
it
does
not
mean
that
it
is
open.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
that
is
right.
it
does,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
yes.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
well,
i
think
that
our
facts
are
a
little
bit
different
in
terms
of
our
area
being
a
completely
wooded
area.
i
think
our
facts
are
stronger
in
this
situation.
we
did
not
have
a
gravel
road
that
the
police
went
onto
so
i
think
our
facts
are
stronger
in
that
situation.
we
did
not
have
a
locked
gate
as
oliver
did
have
so
i
think
they
balance
each
other
out.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
core
area
analysis
set
forth
by
the
state
of
maine
in
that
a
core
area
and
the
house
are
the
only
areas
subject
to
fourth
amendment
right
is
a
theory
that
was
specifically
rejected
by
united
states
v.
chadwick
and
upheld
by
other
cases
in
this
court.
the
contention
by
the
state
that
people
would
be
able
to
buy
land
and
fence
it
and
grow
marijuana
any
way
they
want
to
without
the
police
being
able
to
do
anything
about
it,
of
course,
has
no
merit
because
the
police
can
get
a
search
warrant
as
they
have
in
the
past
and
as
they
will
in
the
future.
in
terms
of
the
body
or
kidnap
victim
being
on
the
premises
certainly
the
police
would
be
able
to
go
in
without
a
warrant
because
those
circumstances
have
been
held
to
be
exigent
circumstances
in
state
courts
as
well
as
in
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
take
a
look
at
the
policy
reasons
which
do
not
justify
abandonment
of
the
fourth
amendment
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
analysis
in
favor
of
a
per
se
exception.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
well,
in
terms
of
the
per
se
exception
this
court,
of
course,
has
never
extended
that
to
open
fields,
but
if
you
look
at
the
reasons
for
the
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
that
this
court
has
upheld
we
have
seen
that
they
have
been
in
the
context
to
preserve
the
safety
of
police
officers,
to
prevent
the
loss
or
destruction
of
evidence
or
in
the
special
nature
of
a
government
interest
such
as
inventory
searches.
we
have
seen
hot
pursuit,
exigent
circumstances,
automobile
searches,
searches
incident
to
an
area
surrounding
a
lawful
arrest,
the
search
of
a
border,
the
consent
search,
the
stop
and
frisk.
of
course,
these
are
none
of
the
situations
presented
in
this
case.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
possibility
for
police
abuse
is
manifest
if
we
adopted
a
per
se
exception
because
we
would
need
no
probable
cause.
we
would
allow
indiscriminate
searches
by
police
to
continually
hope
to
find
evidence
of
a
crime
instead
of
the
general
rule
that
all
warrantless
searches
are
per
se
unreasonable
except
for
a
few
carefully
guarded
exceptions.
the
bright
line
rule
proposed
by
petitioner
in
this
case
will
alter
that
general
rule
to
the
extent
that
all
warrantless
searches
are
per
se
reasonable
except
those
searches
of
houses
and
the
core
area.
this
i
would
have
to
say
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
nor
the
letter
of
the
constitution.
it
is
important
to
note
in
this
case
that
there
was
clearly
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
which
was
reasonable.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
that
would
be
one
factor
which
might
be
enough
to
establish
probable
cause.
i
mean
it
would
depend
on
certainly
the
person
taking
and
examining
the
picture
whether
they
would
have
the
expertise
to
determine
from
the
air
whether
that
was
marijuana--
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
--certainly
the
case
law
has
said
that
and
i
have
not
heard
any
constitutional
arguments
that
have
said
that
that
is
not
the
correct
analysis.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
yes.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
no.
that
would
not
be
okay.
ms.
donna
l.
zeegers
right.
