mr.
wayne
s.
moss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
fourth
amendment
protection
does
not
apply
to
mr.
thornton's
woods
because
any
subjected
expectation
of
privacy
he
entertained
in
his
woods
was
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law.
subjected
expectation
may
have
been
rational
as
a
matter
of
property
law,
but
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
property
rights.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
people
from
unreasonable
governmental
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
i
do.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
we
do
believe
that
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
from
unreasonable
governmental
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
but
the
intent
here
is
to
protect
an
underlying
core
zone
of
privacy
which
is
essential
for
the
individual
to
enjoy
some
fundamental
level
of
freedom
in
our
society.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
there
can
be
property
law
involved.
in
a
property
right
in
excluding
others
there
is
a
privacy
interest
that
adheres
in
that
property
right
in
excluding
others.
but
the
primary
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
though
is
not
to
protect
that
property
right
but
to
protect
a
core
zone
of
privacy.
the
framers
put
forth
certain
examples
as
to
what
would
constitute
that
core
zone
of
privacy
and
they
said
persons,
house,
papers
and
effects,
and
we
contend
that
or
agree
that
it
could
also
include
other
places
which
a
person
personalizes
by
his
activity
by
construction
and
use
to
make
like
a
home.
this
core
zone
of
privacy,
however,
would--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--there
could
be
a
buffer
zone
around
the
house,
and
in
suburban
and
urban
areas
there
very
well
may
be
a
buffer
zone
around
the
house
to
which
fourth
amendment
protections
would
apply
in
order
to
preserve
the
integrity
and
security
of
people
within
the
house
itself.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
that
is
our
position.
so
that--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--the
entry
here
in
this
case?
it
is
legal...
it
is
not
unconstitutional.
there
may
be
a
problem
as
far
as
property
law
goes,
and
there
may
even
be
a
problem
under
maine
law
as
far
as
criminal
trespass
goes,
but--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--at
that
particular
point
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
they
can
enter.
as
a
matter
of
property
law
they
would
get
into
trouble,
but
there
would
be
no
problem
as
far
as
constitutional
law
goes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying
that...
even
in
katz
itself
this
court
recognized
that
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
be
translated
into
a
general
constitutional
right
of
privacy.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
that
is
our
position
and
i
would
like
to
explain
that.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
correct,
yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
fourth
amendment
protections
would
not
apply
at
all.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
which
cases
do
you
have
in
mind?
we
think
our
position
is
consistent
with
western
alfalfa
and
also
with
camar
and
say
which
are
mentioned
in
western
alfalfa
so
we
do
not
see
any
problem
there.
i
would
like
to
return
to
justice
white's
question
as
to
what
a
land
owner
might
be
able
to
do
to
or
whether
he
can
create
any
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
fields
and
woods.
our
position
is
that
simply
by
putting
up
perimeter
fencing
and
boundaries
without
actually
personalizing
the
woods
and
fields
themselves
but
just
leaving
them
either
in
an
undeveloped
or
in
their
agricultural
state
that
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
create
any
fourth
amendment
interest
in
those
fields
and
woods.
he
must
do
substantially
more
than
that.
he
must
personalize
the
area
in
order
to
create
a
fourth
amendment
interest
in
the
fields
and
woods,
and
without
such
personalization--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
he
may
seize
in
the
sense
of--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
that
is
our
position
that
the
items
are
in
plain
view.
fourth
amendment
protections
attach
to
the
seizure,
probable
cause
would
be
required
in
order
to...
if
the
officers
had
made
a
warrantless
seizure
in
this
case
they
would
have
had
to
have
probable
cause
in
order
to
make
seizure.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
they
could.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
that
is
correct.
once
again
it
is
the
position
that
fourth
amendment
protections
do
not
apply
here.
now
in
the
situation
that
you
just
posed
there
might
be
some
state
trespass
problems.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
that
is
the
state's
position.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
effects
are
personal
effects,
but
they
do
not
actually
reach
as
far
as
real
estate
or
property.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
well,
they
said
their
effects
which
suggests
personal
effects.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
well,
it
does
not
say...
in
the
fifth
amendment
they
did
use
the
word
"property"
but
in
the
fourth
amendment
they
did
not.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
it
would
apply
to
personal
property
but
not
to
real
property.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
hear
the--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--i
think
hester
is
such
a
case.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
hester
said
that
the...
and
if
i
remember
it
correctly
the
exact
sentence
was
something
like
the
special
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
extended
to
the
people
and
their
persons,
houses
and
papers
and
effects
do
not
extend
to
the
open
fields.
then
they
said
that
the
distinction
between
the
open
fields
and
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
is--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--pardon?
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
it
is
in
the
opinion.
it
is
in
the
opinion
and
i
will
read
it
if
you
like.
this
is
257--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--it
is
on
page
59.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
right.
it
says
"the
special
protection
accorded
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
people
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
is
not
extended
to
the
open
fields--
"
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
that
is
true.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes.
that
is
correct,
and
he
is
not
talking
about
something
that
is--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes.
that
would
be
our
position
as
well.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
no,
because
we
are
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
itself
is
protecting
only
a
core
zone
of
privacy
and
once
one
is
outside
that
core
zone--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--no.
we
are
saying--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--pardon?
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
it
could
also
include
a
buffer
zone
that
might
be
around
the
house.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
it
could
also
include
areas
outside
the
house
which
a
person
would
personalize.
it
could
be
a--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--it
could
be
a
telephone
booth--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--it
could
be
a
barn.
it
could
be
a
tent
that
a
person
puts
up
in
his
woods
and
lives
in,
but
it
would
not
actually
be
the
woods
itself.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
although
we
are
not
actually
using
a
curtilage
analysis.
we
are
talking
about
a
core
zone
of
privacy
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
it
could
be
if--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
but
we
are
agreeing
though
that
fourth
amendment
protection
would
apply
to
a
barn.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
wherever
the
barn
itself
is
located
because
that
would
be
the
type
of--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
and
that
would
be--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
in
the
sense
that
a
person--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes,
by
construction
and
use
in
a
way
that
fields
and
woods
even
fenced
and
posted
ones
are
not.
the
state
of
maine's
core
concern
here
is
that
if
the
maine
court's
holding
is
allowed
to
stand
that
it
permits
people
to
buy
up
large
tracts
of
land
and
fence
them
and
post
them
and
then
invoke
fourth
amendment
protections
for
those
fields
and
woods
and
then
conduct
elicit
activities
behind
that
fencing
and
posting
and
invoke
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
thereby
remain
free
from
government
investigation.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
but
the
house
is
a
core
zone
of
privacy.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
but--
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
--yes.
the
distinction,
though,
is
in
terms
of
the
privacy
interest
in
the
house
versus
the
fields
and
woods.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
yes,
it
could,
but
we
are
not
in
any
way
saying
that
the
fourth
amendment
would
not
apply
to
a
place
of
business.
this
case
is
not
like
katz
in
that
the
court
does
not
have
to
extrapolate
fourth
amendment
principles
to
the
20th
century
phenomena
of
the
telephone
booth.
the
fields
and
woods
and
farms
that
we
are
talking
about
here
were
in
existence
in
the
late
1700's
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
drafted.
the
framers
could
have
contemplated
them.
mr.
wayne
s.
moss
the
pine
trees
lock
much
the
same.
they
left
pine
trees,
woods,
fields...
they
left
them
out
of
the
analysis
of
where
fourth
amendment
protections
apply,
and
there
would
even
be...
our
position
is
that
there
would
actually
be
even
less
expectation
of
privacy
now
in
fields
and
woods
than
there
was
in
the
1700's
because
we
now
do
have
airplanes
bringing
whole
areas
of
fields
and
woods
into
public
view
which
would
not
have
been
open
to
view
in
the
late
1700's.
thank
you.
