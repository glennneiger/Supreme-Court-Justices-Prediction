mr.
howard
c.
westwood
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
for
the
second
time
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
case
arises
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act
which
provides
for
common
carriers
by
air,
a
pattern
of
regulation
generally
similar
to
that
provided
by
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
surface
carriage.
it
arises
particularly
under
section
411
of
that
act,
a
section
that
is
modeled
on
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
pursuant
to
that
section
the
civil
aeronautics
board
is
authorized
to
institute
proceedings
against
the
air
carriers
where
--
and
if
it
finds
after
notice
and
hearing
that
an
air
carrier
is
engaged
in
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
an
unfair
or
deceptive
practice,
it
shall
order
such
carrier
to
cease
therefrom.
the
petitioner,
american
airlines,
has
been
engaged
in
air
transportation
under
that
name
for
some
quarter
century.
it
is
one
of
the
leading
airlines
in
the
country.
the
respondent,
north
american
airlines
began
using
that
name
a
few
years
ago
in
its
air
transport
operations
in
competition
with
the
petitioner
over
the
principal
transcontinental
route
from
new
york
to
los
angeles.
because
of
the
similarity
between
the
name
of
the
respondent
and
the
long
established
name
of
the
petitioner,
the
cab
instituted
a
proceeding
against
the
respondent
under
section
411.
after
an
extensive
evidentiary
hearing
and
the
other
procedural
steps
that
are
normal
in
such
a
case,
the
board
made
its
findings
and
rendered
its
opinion,
it
found
that
the
names
of
the
respondent
and
the
petitioner
were
similar,
that
that
similarity
had
caused
substantial
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
traveling
public
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
two
carriers,
and
it
concluded
that
the
respondent's
use
of
a
name
thus
similar
and
causing
such
confusion
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
or
unfair
practice
in
violation
of
section
411.
the
board
therefore
ordered
the
respondent
to
cease
using
that
name.
it
also
ordered
the
respondent
to
cease
using
any
other
name
that
would
involve
the
word
american.
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
court
reverse
the
board,
this
is
the
first
time
it
was
before
that
court.
it
reversed
the
board
on
the
ground
that
a
case
of
trade
name
confusion
of
this
sort
did
not
constitute
a
violation
of
section
411
with
which
the
cab
had
the
power
to
deal.
on
certiorari,
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals.
it
held
that
the
evidentiary
findings
as
to
substantial
public
confusion
did
disclose
a
section
411
case.
the
case
was
remanded
by
this
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
enable
that
court
to
determine
whether
the
record
sustained
the
evidentiary
findings.
on
remand,
that
court
without
further
brief
or
argument
entered
its
judgment
with
a
very
brief
opinion
which
is
in
question
here,
that
is
in
question
here
in
part.
now,
the
first
part
of
it
is
not
in
question
here.
the
first
part
was,
as
we
say,
quite
in
response
to
this
courts
remand.
it
examined
the
findings
as
to
substantial
public
confusion.
it
held
that
those
findings
were
sustained
by
the
evidence.
therefore,
it
affirmed
the
order
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
requiring
the
respondent
to
cease
using
the
name
north
american
airlines.
now,
there
is
no
--
no
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
raising
any
question
about
that
portion
of
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
we
--
that
--
that
is
our
view
of
the
case.
although,
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
court,
it
--
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
as
to
whether
we
specifically
raise
that
as
an
independent
question.
now,
in
the
--
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
in
our
statement
of
the
first
question
we've
presented,
we
said
that
the
court
below
went
beyond
the
--
the
purpose
and
scope
of
the
remand.
in
candor,
i
must
say
we
never
really
elaborated
upon
that
particular
point
and
in
the
restatement
of
our
first
question
in
our
brief
to
this
court,
we
did
not
say
in
the
statement
of
the
question
that
it
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
remand.
although,
as
i
recall
in
the
text
of
our
argument,
we
pointed
out
that
in
fact,
in
our
view,
it
did
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
remand.
now,
as
to
the
second
part
of
the
opinion
and
judgment
below,
after
finding
and
after
holding
what
i
said
and
affirming
the
decision
insofar
of
the
--
the
order
of
the
cab
and
so
far
as
it
forbad
the
use
of
the
name
north
american,
the
lower
court
then
went
on
and
in
one
sentence
said
that
a
finding
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
to
the
effect
that
the
term
american
has
a
secondary
meaning,
was
not
sustained
by
the
record.
accordingly,
said
the
court,
it
would
reverse
the
cab's
order
insofar
as
the
order
reached
other
uses
of
other
names
involving
the
word
american.
now,
in
the
meantime,
the
respondent
had
changed
its
name,
by
changing
one
syllable,
the
syllable
north
was
changed
to
trans.
so
that
as
of
the
time
the
lower
court
acted,
the
name
of
the
respondent,
the
name
it
was
using
in
its
operations
was
trans
american
airlines
instead
of
north
american
airlines.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
the
record
does
not
disclose
that.
the
--
the
change
in
the
respondents
name
had
been
occasioned
by
another
litigation,
a
private
lawsuit
brought
against
the
respondent
by
north
american
aviation
company,
a
--
an
aircraft
manufacturer
in
los
angeles.
that
company
--
this
was
a
trade
mark
and
i
think
there
was
trade
mark
involved,
in
any
event
it
was
a
common
law
in
fair
competition
case.
that
company
charged
that
the
respondent
had
fraudulently
sought
by
this
name
north
american
airlines
to
appropriate
the
goodwill
of
the
aircraft
manufacturer.
that
was
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
in
california.
that
court
held
for
the
plaintiff,
it
enjoined
the
respondent
as
the
plaintiff
had
requested.
the
case
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
court
denied
certiorari,
thereupon,
the
order
became
final.
it
was
thereafter
that
the
respondent
switched
from
north
to
trans.
after
the
court
of
appeals
order
and
opinion,
as
i
have
described
it,
the
petitioner
here
and
the
government,
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
petitioned
the
lower
court
for
rehearing
and
reconsideration,
raising
both
of
the
questions
which
are
presented
now
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
those
petitions
were
denied
to
the
lower
court
without
opinion.
i
shall
discuss
both
points
raised
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
first
point
is
this,
the
lower
court
in
dealing
with
the
scope
of
the
board's
remedial
order
after
having
affirmed
the
findings
and
the
determination
of
the
board
that
a
violation
of
section
411
was
disclosed.
acted
sua
sponte,
never
having
been
asked
by
the
respondent
to
pass
on
the
scope
of
the
board's
order,
the
respondent
never
having
objected
at
any
time
throughout
the
proceeding
either
before
the
board
or
the
lower
court
to
the
scope
of
the
board's
order.
now,
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
under
which
judicial
review
occurs,
provides
in
section
1006
(e)
that
no
objection
to
an
order
of
the
board
shall
be
considered
by
the
court
on
review
unless
such
objections
shall
have
been
urged
before
the
board
or
unless
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
failure
to
do
so.
the
respondent
in
its
memorandum
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
admitted
that
it
had
never
objected
to
the
scope
of
the
boards
order.
in
the
lower
court,
in
answer
to
our
petitions
for
reconsideration,
the
respondent
suggested
that
it
had
objected
to
the
scope
of
the
order
in
its
exception
five
to
the
examiners
report.
anticipating
such
an
argument,
we
printed
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
the
full
text
of
that
exception.
it
discloses
no
such
objection.
thereafter,
the
respondent
in
opposing
our
petition
for
certiorari
admitted
that
it
had
never
raised
the
objection.
now,
were
there
reasonable
grounds
for
its
failure
to
do
so?
none
at
all.
the
facts
are
these,
in
the
original
briefs
to
the
examiner
an
order
of
the
scope
ultimately
entered
by
the
board
was
proposed
in
the
examiners
initial
decision,
an
order
of
the
scope
ultimately
entered
by
the
board
was
recommended.
the
respondent
filed
45
pages
of
detailed
exceptions
to
that
initial
decision,
and
never
a
word
in
the
entire
45
pages
was
directed
to
an
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order
recommended
by
the
examiner,
despite
the
fact
that
the
cab's
rules
provide
that
exceptions
to
an
initial
decision
must
be
specific
and
must
be
--
and
must
state
the
grounds
therefore,
and
if
not
so,
then
an
objection
is
waived.
in
the
briefs
to
the
board
in
support
of
exceptions,
the
respondent
never
made
any
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order.
in
the
oral
argument
to
the
board,
a
transcript
of
which
is
in
the
unprinted
transcript
before
this
court,
no
such
objection
was
made.
after
the
board's
opinion
and
order
in
which
this
order
of
this
scope
was
entered,
although,
the
board's
rules
provide
for
a
petition
for
reconsideration
if
a
party
wishes
to
file
one,
none
was
filed,
and
no
objection
to
the
scope
of
the
order
was
made
or
urged
by
the
respondent
in
the
lower
court.
now,
here
was
abundant
opportunity
to
raise
objection,
not
once
but
over
and
again.
and
in
these
circumstances,
we
suggest,
that
the
provision
of
the
law
to
the
effect
that
objections
not
urged
can
be
entertained
by
an
appellate
court,
only
when
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
failure
to
urge
them,
that
that
provision
has
not
been
complied
with
by
the
lower
court
because
here,
there
were
no
reasonable
grounds
for
a
failure
to
object
to
the
scope
of
the
order
if
the
respondent
ever
wanted
to.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
every
bit
of
the
respondent's
argument
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
this
case
had
been,
that
section
411
did
not
apply,
that
there
was
no
public
confusion
and
that
it
was
free
to
use
the
name
north
american.
and
it
gave
to
the
board
the
impression
as
clearly
as
though
it
had
stated
so
in
so
many
words
that
if
it
lost
that
argument
then
the
scope
of
the
order
to
be
entered
was
of
no
concern
to
it.
now,
i
shall
burden
the
court
with
a
reference
to
all
the
cases
it
has
decided
that
make
it
clear
that
the
respondent
here
is
in
--
that
the
court
below
here
had
no
business
going
into
this
question.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
most
recently
decided
case,
the
moog
case
only
last
monday,
makes
clear
the
--
the
proposition
that
objections
must
be
urged
before
the
agency.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
let's
assume
it
hadn't
--
that
had
not
--
there
have
been
no
petition
to
this
court
and
have
gone
back
directly,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
they
probably
would,
but
it
--
it
would
have
--
they
would
have
had
to
explain
why
the
bar
with
respect
to
secondary
meaning,
which
brings
up
the
second
point
i'm
going
to
argue,
does
not
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
and
that
would
just
to
add
still
further
to
an
administrative
proceeding
already
too
long.
all
right,
now,
the
second
point,
and
that
is
that
assuming
a
question
was
properly
before
the
court
and
order
of
the
scope
in
question
could
not
be
entered
because
there
was
no
--
the
record
do
not
sustain
a
finding
of
secondary
meaning
in
the
term
american.
the
--
the
doctrine
of
secondary
meaning
comes
from
private
cases
involving
trademark
infringement
and
common
law
unfair
competition.
there
are
many,
many
such
cases,
hundreds
of
pages
have
been
written
with
respect
to
this
secondary
meaning
doctrine.
there
are
dicta
in
some
cases,
principally
early
cases,
which
purport
to
set
forth
a
rule
of,
i
take
it
a
rule
of
proof,
to
the
effect
that
the
plaintiff
in
such
a
case
has
not
established
the
necessary
property
interest
in
the
name
in
question,
leading
a
court
to
protect
it
and
by
awarding
damages
or
an
injunction,
unless
it
establishes
that
it
was
the
exclusive
user
of
the
term.
now,
there
are
other
cases
--
there
are
other
cases
which
say
that
that
exclusive
user
rule
applies
only
in
trademark
cases
and
not
in
common
law
unfair
competition
cases.
now,
the
matter
is
technical,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
this
exclusive
user
rule
is
bad
law
in
private
cases
but
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
that
that
whole
doctrine
that
is
dealt
with
in
private
law
cases
has
no
application
in
a
case
brought
under
a
statute
for
the
protection
of
the
public,
administered
by
a
public
agency
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
not
for
the
vindication
of
any
private
property
right.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
cab
did
make
a
finding,
that
the
term
american
had
acquired
a
secondary
meaning
despite
the
fact
that
pan
american
world
airways
had
used
the
word
american
in
its
name
for
some
--
well,
as
long
as
american
has
used
the
name.
it
did
make
such
a
finding
but
it
was
very
clear
in
its
opinion
that
apart
from
that
finding,
its
decision
stood
because
in
applying
section
411
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
the
question
of
secondary
meaning
or
not
was
beside
the
point.
we
urge
in
our
petition
that
by
imposing
this
limitation,
the
secondary
meaning
limitation
drawn
from
the
body
of
private
law,
upon
the
power
of
a
public
agency
to
remedy
a
violation
of
the
act
which
here
has
been
found,
and
properly
found,
and
duly
affirmed
by
the
court,
unduly
interferes
with
the
discretion
of
an
agency
to
rule
out
the
source
of
wrong
and
to
prevent
recurrence.
and
that
what
may
or
may
not
be
the
appropriate
doctrines
that
would
apply
in
some
private
lawsuit
under
other
circumstances
are
quite
beside
the
point.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
scope
of
the
order
entered
by
the
board
was
exactly
like
the
scope
of
the
order
--
orders
entered
in
similar
cases
by
the
federal
trade
commission
under
section
5
of
the
trade
commission
act
for
over
30
years,
and
as
explained
by
the
board,
it
entered
such
an
order
in
order
to
get
at
the
source
of
the
confusion,
which
it
had
found
to
exist
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
source
of
the
confusion
was
the
common
word
american.
now,
again
without
referring
to
all
of
the
precedence
of
this
court,
again
including
the
moog
case
decision
and
which
was
announced
only
last
monday.
it
is
clear,
we
believe,
that
the
lower
court
was
unduly
interfering
with
and
seeking
to
circumscribe
the
appropriate
way
of
administrative
discretion
to
cope
with
the
problems
presented
by
law
violation.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
it
should
be
finally
decided
here
at
long
last.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
the
final
answer
--
the
final
answer
is
that
the
--
the
court
of
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
no.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
no,
no,
no.
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
what
should
permit
the
cab's
order
to
stand.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
the
--
the
cab's
order
reaches
other
uses
of
the
term
american
as
well
as
north
american.
it
provides
that
the
respondent
shall
not
use
the
term
north
american
airlines
or
any
other
word
involved,
any
other
name
involved
in
the
use
of
the
word
american.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
no,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
i
was
short
--
short
handed.
no,
reverse
only
that
part
of
the
judgment
and
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
before
this
court.
that
this
--
this
court,
as
we
see
it,
should
find
the
error
we
have
pointed
out
on
both
grounds.
now,
the
government
urges
just
one
on
the
theory
that
you
--
that
is
the
second
one
on
the
theory
that
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
first
one,
of
course
that's
true
but
we
think
both
are
important.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
either
one
is
enough.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
this
court
again
last
monday
suggested
that
it
had
done
something
in
a
case
because
a
litigation
had
gone
on
for
a
long
time.
no,
i
don't
really
mean
that,
your
honor,
what
i
do
mean
is
that
the
case
is
right
for
final
decision
here,
that
upon
a
determination
that
the
lower
court
was
in
error
which
this
court
must
reach,
we
think,
no
question
remains
in
the
case
and
there's
no
occasion
simply
for
a
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceeding
--
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
having
done
what
they
did,
there
was
no
other
question
before
it
and
i
mean
that
is
our
first
point,
and
on
the
second
point,
they
were
wrong.
now,
nobody
has
suggested
any
other
point,
unless
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
will
again
think
of
something
else
but
it's
--
it's
time
that
there
will
be
no
such
opportunity
to
bring
up
some
other
point.
now,
the
solicitor
general
last
august
filed
with
the
court
a
memorandum
suggesting
that
the
case
had
become
moot.
we
filed
--
but
taking
the
position
that
it
was
not
moot,
we
too
filed
a
memorandum
in
response
to
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
agreeing
that
the
case
had
not
become
moot.
now,
the
facts
on
mootness
are
briefly
these,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
instituted
a
proceeding
against
this
respondent
and
its
associated
interest
sometime
ago,
in
that
proceeding,
a
number
of
violations
of
the
civil
aeron
act
--
civil
aeronautics
act
by
the
respondent
were
disclosed,
violations
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
name
in
question,
this
was
something
different.
as
a
result
of
a
finding
of
such
violations,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
ordered
that
the
respondent's
authority
to
engage
in
common
carrier
air
transportation
be
revoked
and
that
respondent
cease
engaging
in
such
air
transportation.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
respondent's
appeal,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
june
after
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
our
case.
the
respondent
--
consequently,
the
order
of
the
cab
went
into
effect
and
the
respondent
is
not
now
engaged
in
common
carrier
air
transportation.
the
respondent,
however,
has
not
dissolved
it
or
its
associated
interest.
there
are
several
companies
that
are
under
common
control
and
closely
associated,
are
engaged
in
various
aviation
activities
including
contract
carriage
by
air.
the
respondent
actually
has
pending
before
the
board
at
this
time,
in
at
least
two
dockets
and
actually
i
know
of
one
other,
we
referred
to
the
two
in
our
memorandum
on
mootness
and
overlook
referring
to
the
third
in
which
it
seeks
authority
to
engage
again
as
a
common
carrier
by
air.
one
route
involved
in
one
of
those
dockets
would
be
a
transcontinental
route
from
new
england
on
to
california.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
well,
they
--
well,
i
am
just
--
i'm
sorry,
i
am
just
not
sure.
all
that
--
all
that
i
--
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum
says,
and
these
are
the
only
facts
we
have
to
go
on,
that
--
that
the
respondent
has
not
been
dissolved
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
the
name
trans
american
as
a
matter
of
the
corporate
papers
or
the
name
north
american
as
a
matter
of
the
corporate
papers.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
name
it
has
as
a
matter
of
corporate
papers
at
this
time.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
it
--
well,
i'm
sure
it
isn't
operating
under
the
name
trans
american
or
at
least
i
think
it
is
not.
i
think
it
maybe
operating
it
or
an
associated
interest
maybe
operating
under
a
name
similar
to
the
original
name
of
the
respondent
20th
century.
i'm
sorry
to
be
vague,
your
honor,
but
on
this
point,
we
have
no
record
to
say
if
the
respondent
--
the
solicitor
general's
memorandum.
in
short,
here
is
a
case
where
the
respondent
exists.
certainly,
the
respondent
has
never
acquiesced
in
the
board's
order.
the
controversy
remains.
we
have
been
fighting
right
along.
there
is
an
--
there
is
certainly
a
possibility
that
the
respondent
will
reenter
the
field
of
common
carrier
air
transportation,
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
assert
a
right
to
use
the
word
trans
american
as
it
did
so
vigorously,
after
the
wind
fall
of
the
decision
below
in
its
opposition
to
our
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
lower
court.
and
as
this
court
has
said,
he
who
would
assert
mootness
bares
a
very
heavy
burden
indeed
to
demonstrate
mootness
and
particularly
is
that
the
case
where
as
here,
there
is
involved
not
a
private
dispute
between
private
parties
but
the
question
of
the
validity
of
an
order
of
a
public
agency
under
a
regulation
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
where
the
court's
decision
would
be
of
value
as
a
guide
and
an
aid
to
the
agency
and
the
further
administration
of
the
act.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
the
--
the
civil
aeronautics
board
is.
mr.
howard
c.
westwood
the
--
the
respondent
has
not
--
did
not
file
--
the
respondent
opposed
our
petition
for
certiorari
here,
your
honor.
it
has
filed
no
brief
and
it
has
not
appeared
at
the
argument.
maybe
that's
its
most
eloquent
argument.
thank
you.
