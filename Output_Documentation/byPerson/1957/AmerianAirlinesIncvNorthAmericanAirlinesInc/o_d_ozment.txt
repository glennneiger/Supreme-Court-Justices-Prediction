mr.
o.
d.
ozment
may
it
please
the
court.
although
the
board
is
designated
as
a
respondent
in
this
case,
it
is
appearing
in
support
of
the
petitioner
urging
reversal
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
o.
d.
ozment
we
--
i
think
so.
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
not
specifically
focused
on
that.
i
would
--
i
think
that
would
be
appropriate
because
as
we
understand
it,
the
question
which
the
lower
court
should
have
decided
was
whether
the
remedy
selected
had
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
unlawful
practice
was
found
to
exist
and
we
think
that
that
decision
of
the
court
could
not
have
made
and
we
think
that
this
court
would
be
equally
--
it
will
be
equally
appropriate
for
this
court
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
o.
d.
ozment
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
what
the
carrier
presently
is
doing,
the
business
that
is
being
conducted
is
in
the
name
of
20th
century
airlines
which
was
the
original
name
of
this
company.
there
is
another
company,
an
affiliating
company
doing
business
is
unit
export
company
which
formally
did
business
under
the
names
of
north
american
airlines
and
trans
american
airlines
but
upon
the
taking
effect
of
the
boards
revocation
order,
that
business
of
course
ceased.
we
agreed
with
the
petitioner
in
thinking
that
this
case
has
not
become
moot.
however,
at
the
same
time,
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
change
in
factual
situation
and
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
case
still
has
sufficient
general
importance
to
warrant
decision.
in
that
connection,
we
think
it's
also
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
the
benefits
which
will
come
from
a
decision
in
terms
of
clarifying
the
law.
apart
from
this
particular
case,
the
board's
concern
with
what
the
court
did
rests
with
the
apparent
limitation,
which
the
court
would
--
could
upon
the
board's
power
to
issue
an
effective
order.
what
the
court
said
in
effect
as
we
read
the
opinion
or
at
least
it
will
be
cited
in
future
cases
if
not
reversed
is
that
where
the
board
proscribes
the
use
of
a
particular
name
which
has
been
found
to
cause
confusion.
that
it
cannot
do
so
unless
it
finds
secondary
meaning.
now,
as
we
understand,
secondary
meaning
is
not
a
test,
its
substantive
question
in
any
name
confusion
case
is
whether
there
is
in
fact
a
substantial
confusion.
the
question
on
scope
of
remedy
is
whether
it's
--
it's
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
continued
use
of
the
name
in
some
form
will
cause
the
confusion
to
be
continued
or
fail
to
alleviate
the
confusion
found
to
exist.
in
this
case,
the
change
of
name
actually
employed
was
only
a
single
syllable
prefix.
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
changes
such
as
that,
we
think,
are
not
sufficient.
courts
and
agencies
alike
habitually
in
cases
of
this
sort,
do
excise
the
offending
name,
that's
what
the
board
did
here.
we
think
that
that
was
within
the
board's
power
and
we
think
that
the
court
denied
to
the
board
that
very
necessary
power
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
urge
reversal.
