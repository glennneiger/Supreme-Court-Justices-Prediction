justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
--
how
many
affidavits
do
you
understand
or
permitted
or
at
least
required
under
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
one
affidavit,
one
affidavit.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
actually,
the
word
duty
has
some
key
significance
in
the
first
line
of
this
statute,
does
it
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
might
not
a
district
attorney
perform
on
his
own
the
function
of
filing
an
information
to
punish
the
violation
of
the
federal
law
on
his
own
now.
and
does
the
statute
seem
to
make
it
his
duty
to
do
so,
his
duty
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
whether
an
affidavit
is
filed.
