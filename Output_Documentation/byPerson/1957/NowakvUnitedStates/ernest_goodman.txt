mr.
ernest
goodman
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
are
denaturalization
cases.
both
of
them
involved
two
aliens
who
were
naturalized
in
the
year
1938
at
detroit
and
with
respect
to
both
of
them,
the
cases
were
tried
in
the
1950s
in
detroit
before
the
same
district
judge
and
in
1955
the
opinions
and
judgments
directing
the
cancellation
of
their
citizenship
were
issued
by
the
district
court.
in
both
cases,
it
is
the
government's
claim
that
at
the
time
and
prior
to
the
naturalization
of
mr.
nowak
and
mrs.
maisenberg,
they
have
been
and
were
members
of
the
communist
party
which
the
government
charge
was
an
organization
advocating
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
they
knew
and
accrue
thereof.
the
pleadings,
facts
and
issues
thus
in
both
cases
are
the
same,
substantially
the
same
with
one
exception
which
i
will
mention.
in
the
nowak
case,
the
complaint
was
filed
by
the
government
under
the
1940
nationality
act
and
under
that
act
and
pursuant
to
its
provisions,
the
government
charged
that
mr.
nowak
had
obtained
his
citizenship
through
illegal
procurement
and
by
fraud.
the
maisenberg
case
was
brought
by
the
government
under
the
1952
immigration
and
naturalization
act
and
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
that
act,
the
complaint
charged
concealment
and
misrepresentation
of
material
fact.
for
the
purposes
of
the
argument
and
because
both
parties
have
dealt
at
length
with
the
issues
in
the
case
in
the
nowak
briefs,
i
would
like
to,
with
the
court's
permission,
argue
the
nowak
case
until
--
at
least
until
the
court
would
like
to
have
me
mention
something
concerning
the
other
case.
i
think
that
argument
will
dispose
of
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
the
major
issues
that
are
involved
on
this
appeal.
the
facts
in
the
nowak
case
briefly
and
insofar
as
they
are
material
here
are
as
follows.
nowak
was
born
in
1903
in
poland.
he
came
to
this
country
at
the
age
of
10,
1913.
he
has
lived
here
ever
since.
in
1937
at
detroit,
he
filed
his
preliminary
form
for
naturalization
as
well
--
later
that
year
his
petition
for
naturalization.
and
following
several
interrogations
by
the
immigration
people
and
after
some
investigation,
in
june
of
1938
at
detroit
he
was
granted
his
citizenship
upon
taking
his
oath
in
open
court.
within
six
months
or
after,
in
november
1938,
he
was
elected
from
his
district
to
the
state
senate
for
the
state
of
michigan
and
was
thereafter
elected
for
five
consecutive
two-year
terms
until
1948.
in
december
of
1942
which
was
about
four
years
after
he
had
been
granted
his
naturalization.
the
government
obtained
from
the
grand
jury
in
the
district
court
of
detroit
an
indictment
--
a
criminal
indictment
against
mr.
nowak,
charging
him
with
having
falsified
during
the
course
of
his
naturalization
proceedings
swearing
falsely
in
there.
the
government
at
that
time
contended
the
indictment
that
he
had
concealed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
an
organization
which
at
that
time
the
indictment
charge
was
one
which
thought
opposition
to
organized
government.
several
months
later
in
february
1943,
the
government
of
its
own
motion
dismissed
the
indictment
and
it
was
never
reinstated.
approximately
10
years
later,
december
the
23rd,
1952,
two
days
before
the
new
1952
immigration
and
naturalization
act
went
into
effect.
this
complaint
was
filed.
the
complaint
was
filed
accompanied
by
an
affidavit
of
a
ruben
spicer
which
set
forth
what
is
alleged
to
be
good
cause
for
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
and
i
will
refer
to
the
affidavit
in
my
argument
on
that
point.
but
the
complaint
charged
both
illegality
and
fraud
by
virtue
of
alleged
membership
in
the
communist
party,
an
organization
which
the
complaint
at
that
time
charged
was
one
which
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
he
had
knowledge
of
and
accrued
of
that
advocacy.
the
case
was
tried.
the
government
presented,
i
believe,
12
witnesses.
two
of
whom
testified
concerning
a
claim
of
the
government
that
he
had
falsified
by
denying
membership
in
the
communist
party
orally.
however,
the
district
court,
in
its
opinion,
found
that
evidence
to
be
insufficient
and
--
and
dismissed
that
allegation
of
fraud.
the
other
witnesses
testified
as
to
the
aims
and
objectives
of
the
communist
party,
introduced
a
number
of
books
and
literature
which
however
were
not
attributed
to
the
defendant
but
in
support
of
the
so-called
expert's
opinion
that
they
helped
to
fortify
the
expert's
opinion
that
the
communist
party
did
advocate
violence
to
overthrow
the
government.
a
number
of
other
witnesses
testified
that
mr.
nowak
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
had
attended
meetings
of
the
communist
party
and
attributed
certain
statements
to
him
particularly
three
of
the
greatest
importance
in
the
government's
case
which
it
is
contended
by
the
government
and
was
found
by
the
trial
court
to
constitute
advocacy
on
his
part
or
at
least
knowledge
of
the
advocacy
by
the
communist
party
of
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
the
court's
opinion
found
that
his
citizenship
should
be
canceled
on
the
ground
of
both
illegality
and
fraud.
i
would
like
to
argue
insofar
as
i
am
to
be
able
to
the
course
of
my
argument
following
three
points.
first,
because
of
maybe
the
jurisdictional
question
one
which
the
court
may
want
to
hear
argument
that
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
is
insufficient
in
this
case
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
zucca
decision.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
their
--
that
the
charge
of
illegal
procurement
under
the
1940
act
has
no
support
and
in
any
event
is
outlawed
under
the
principle
of
res
judicata.
third,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
the
claim
of
fraud
in
the
theory
at
least
on
which
it
is
stated
by
the
government
in
this
case
and
upon
which
the
evidence
was
produced
has
not
been
proved.
first,
with
respect
to
the
affidavit,
in
order
to
discuss
that
i
--
i
want
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
zucca
opinion
which
this
court
found
that
--
two
things
as
i
read
the
opinion
at
least,
one
that
an
affidavit
was
a
prerequisite
to
the
initiation
of
a
proceeding
of
this
kind.
there
being
no
affidavit
in
that
case
of
any
kind.the
court
--
the
majority
of
opinion
held
that
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed.
and
secondly,
an
ancillary
holding
in
the
opinion
was
that
the
verification
of
the
complaint
itself
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
--
which
was
based
upon
the
examination
of
the
files
in
that
case
was
insufficient
and
did
not
take
the
place
of
the
affidavit
which
this
court
found
was
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
proceeding.
now,
the
spicer
affidavit
that
is
the
affidavit
signed
by
ruben
spicer
in
this
case
which
is
the
same
practically
in
both
maisenberg
and
the
nowak
case
and
appears
likewise
and
many
of
the
other
decided
cases
the
affidavit
by
spicer
is
an
affidavit
by
the
attorney
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
the
affidavit
states
that
it
is
based
upon
an
examination
of
the
files
of
the
service.
this
morning,
i
had
an
opportunity
of
checking
the
records
and
brief
in
the
zucca
case,
so
this
point
is
not
in
our
brief.
but
in
checking
the
--
the
complaint
in
the
zucca
opinion
and
comparing
it
in
detail
with
the
affidavit
of
mr.
spicer
in
this
case,
the
allegations
are
essentially
the
same
and
the
language
is
almost
similar,
many
of
the
paragraphs
are
exactly
the
like
--
alike
in
specific
language
and
specific
allusions
and
with
respect
to
the
formulations.
for
all
practical
purposes,
a
comparison
of
the
complaint
in
the
zucca
case
and
the
spicer
affidavit
in
this
case,
i
think
we'll
make
it
very
clear
that
the
affidavits
or
the
complaint
and
the
affidavit
are
practically
the
same
and
the
comparison
of
the
affidavits
in
both
the
cases
before
the
court
will
indicate
that
it
is
essentially
a
form
of
affidavit
or
in
the
zucca
case
a
complaint.
so
what
we
have
here
in
connection
with
this
issue
as
we
see
it
is
a
question
as
to
whether
a
sworn
complaint
is
filed
in
the
zucca
case
which
was
held
to
be
insufficient
by
the
court
there
where
treated
in
the
same
form
as
an
affidavit
attached
to
the
complaint
would
be
sufficient
wherein
both
instances
it's
based
solely
upon
examination
of
the
files
and
records.
now
in
order
to
state
our
position
on
it,
i
would
like
to
first
indicate
the
extent
to
which
i
think
the
government
mistakes
our
position
in
its
brief.
they've
state
our
position
i
think
because
it
makes
it
much
easier
to
justify
its
own
position,
but
their
position
argued
for
by
the
government
in
its
brief
is
not
our
position.
but
the
government
there
claims
that
what
we
assert
and
what
we
seek
this
court
to
do
is
that
we
claim
they
say
that
the
affidavit
must
be
“a
product
of
eyewitness
observation”
that's
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
47.
we
make
no
such
claim
or
do
we
think
that
the
court
would
be
justified
in
holding
the
government
to
any
such
position.our
position
as
argued
in
our
brief
and
as
it
is
here
is
that
the
affidavit
that's
required
by
the
government
before
they
institute
a
naturalization
proceeding
is
one
which
is
similar
in
nature,
two,
an
affidavit
which
is
required
in
order
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
or
one
that's
required
in
order
to
justify
expedition
proceeding.
many
decisions
in
both
areas
have
pretty
well
made
clear
that
in
--
at
least
those
fields,
an
affidavit
which
is
required
there
is
one
which
not
need
not
be
based
upon
eyewitness
observation.
i
think
if
any
rule
is
to
be
applied
to
them.
it's
perhaps
the
one
that's
used
by
wigmore
extensively
in
his
discussion
of
evidence.
that
is
--
there
must
be
some
circumstantial
probability
of
the
trustworthiness
of
the
evidence
set
forth
in
the
affidavit.
i
don't
quote
that
from
any
decision
of
the
court
but
i
think
generally
that
is
what
the
cases
hold.
and
would
--
i
think
the
rule
that
might
well
apply.
in
this
court's
decision
in
zucca,
you
mentioned
in
the
majority
opinion,
an
opinion
issued
shortly
after
the
1906
act
was
passed
by
then
attorney
general
bonaparte
which
held
or
which
was
an
opinion
stating
that
a
request
for
the
institution
of
denaturalization
proceedings
requested
from
the
department
head
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
institution
of
those
proceeding.
in
its
brief,
the
government
here,
not
only
mention
that
particular
opinion
but
at
page
53
of
its
brief,
sets
forth
the
letter
from
mr.
strauss
to
the
attorney
general
which
he
sets
forth
in
detail,
the
nature
of
the
evidence
presented
as
good
cause
for
the
institution
of
the
denaturalization
proceeding.
now,
if
the
court
will
examine
the
strauss
letter,
it
is
clear,
i
think,
from
the
letter
itself
that
what
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
as
good
cause
was
not
a
hearsay
statement
based
upon
examination
of
file
such
as
its
present
in
the
spicer
affidavit.
rather
what
was
present
there
was
a
--
a
group
of
authenticated
documents,
copies
of
which
were
attached
and
of
duly
authenticated
which
set
forth
precisely
and
in
detail
and
in
the
form
of
substantive
original
evidence.
the
nature
of
the
claim
presented
to
the
attorney
general
that
the
alien
in
that
case
was
not
--
was
over
the
age
of
18
when
he
applied
for
a
citizenship
contrary
to
the
statute.
so
that
if
one
were
to
compare
that
particular
proceeding
with
the
spicer
proceeding,
one
would
have
to
say
that
spicer
should
have
if
his
affidavit
were
to
be
based
upon
the
same
kind
of
evidence
present
in
the
other
case,
some
original
documentation
or
evidence
which
would
have
supported
the
ultimate
conclusions
which
this
affidavit
consisted
at.
i
further
call
the
court's
attention
on
this
respect
as
an
illustration
of
the
kind
of
an
affidavit
which
i
think
the
government
ought
to
be
compelled
to
file
if
it
wants
to
institute
these
proceedings.
the
case
of
brinegar
versus
the
united
states,
this
is
cited
not
in
our
brief
but
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
65.
this
deals
with
search
and
seizure
not
with
denaturalization
proceedings
but
i
think
the
principle
is
well-stated
there
because
in
that
case,
if
the
government
relies
on
--
on
the
assumption
that
sufficient
--
an
affidavit
is
sufficient
which
is
based
upon
hearsay
or
at
least
none
eyewitness
observation,
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
the
officers
who
made
the
search
and
seizure
following
an
arrest
without
a
search
warrant
in
that
case
had
personal
knowledge
and
that
search
and
seizure
in
that
case
were
sufficiently
based
upon
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
officer.
but
in
dealing
generally
with
the
problems
of
officers
in
connection
with
searches
and
seizures,
they
--
they
make
the
observation
that
in
dealing
with
probable
cost
we
deal
with
probabilities.
and
here
where
a
good
cause
which
is
tantamount
to
probable
cost
i
--
i
assume
we
also
can
deal
with
probabilities.
that
does
not
mean
here's
a
conclusion
by
somebody
who
examined
the
file
but
it
deals
more
with
--
it
deals
with
some
basic
facts,
some
basic
information,
some
records
which
the
court
can
examine
at
the
outset
of
the
case
and
determine
from
its
own
observation,
on
the
basis
of
his
own
exercise
of
his
own
legal
judgment
whether
in
fact
the
material
upon
which
the
government
relies
for
good
cause
justifies
the
--
the
conclusion
that
it
is
a
good
cause.
mr.
ernest
goodman
if
your
honor
means
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
if
your
honor
means
that
if
the
affidavits
filed
with
the
department
of
justice
had
been
attached
--
copies
had
been
attached
to
mr.
spicer's
affidavit.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
i
think
that
would
have
been
sufficient
because
i
think
the
criterion
then
would
be.
could
the
court
by
examining
the
basic
evidence
which
mr.
spicer
apparently
examined,
in
examining
this
evidence,
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
mr.
spicer
did
as
an
illustration.
the
government
in
this
case
and
its
complaint
charged
not
only
the
allegations
i
have
mentioned
but
another
one.
they
charge
that
mr.
nowak
at
the
time
he
became
a
citizen
oath
his
allegiance
to
the
soviet
union
and
that,
however,
because
of
his
conduct
in
subsequent
action,
he
did
not
disavowed
that
allegiance
and
maintained
its
allegiance.
now
no
evidence
was
ever
produced
on
that
of
any
kind
or
any
claim
made
further
--
except
what's
in
the
affidavit,
whether
there
was
any
basis
for
that
statement
in
mr.
spicer's
affidavit
or
not,
nobody
knows
merely
his
conclusion.
it
may
well
be
that
there's
nothing
in
the
government's
file
which
would
permit
the
making
of
such
a
statement
yet
it
appeared
and
no
court
could
determine
whether
it
was
justified
or
not
or
gave
rise
to
good
cause
or
not
unless
you
were
to
accept
mr.
spicer's
affidavit
that
he
examined
the
files
and
to
him
it
appears
to
be
so.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no
i
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
that
is
true
except
i
break
--
break
it
down
to
two
points.
the
court
in
determining
whether
the
affidavit
is
sufficient,
it
must
first
have
the
facts
to
decide
whether
there
are
facts
claimed
to
be
available
then
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts
must
be
conclusions
that
the
court
may
draw.
in
this
case,
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
determine
neither
one
nor
the
other.
must
accept

--
mr.
ernest
goodman
have
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
his
subs
--
his
conclusions
are
substituted
for
the
conclusions
that
the
court
would
otherwise
have
to
make
himself
from
the
fact.
of
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
sir.
now,
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
files
themselves,
i
merely
want
to
refer
the
court
as
an
evidence
of
what
such
files
might
contain
mr.
spicer
and
the
affidavit
refers
to
him
as
the
official
files.
what
he
means
by
official
is
not
clear
and
whether
they
are
merely
files
that
he
has
in
his
possession
or
files
that
the
law
make
official
or
not.
it
is
not
clear
at
all.
but
the
nature
of
files
in
the
hands
of
an
organization
of
this
kind
of
necessity
and
no
criticism
applied
in
it,
but
on
necessity
must
be
such
as
those
which
were
described
by
j.
edgar
hoover
in
the
jencks
opinion
in
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
clark
which
i
think
would
--
if
transferred
to
the
immigration
department
here
might
well
be
indicate
that
a
person
at
the
best
intention
might
--
from
all
of
the
voluminous
files
which
are
there,
the
nature
will
be
very
likely
to
be
at
still
present
a
conclusion
which
is
not
justified
by
the
material
which
he
has
to
go
over
(voice

--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
no.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
the
brinegar
case
answers
that.
there,
the
--
the
evidence
on
which
the
court
found
he
had
a
right
to
make
a
search
and
seizure
later
was
excluded
at
the
trial
on
many
reasons.
the
court
said
it
does
not
depend
upon
whether
it
is
admissible
at
the
trial.
it
depends
upon
whether
they
are
sufficiently
probable
so
that
if
the
time
the
affidavit
is
made,
the
court
can
give
them
credence.
now
the
--
i
just
want
to
mention
too
that
the
government
also
infers
to
us
the
statement
that
what
we
require
as
an
affidavit
which
contains
the
evidence
in
“exhausted
detail”.
i
merely
want
to
say
we
make
no
such
claim.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary.
the
prima
facie
case
is
all
that
i
think
would
be
necessary
in
any
event.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
would
think
a
prima
facie
case
would
have
to
be
shown
with
respect
to
the
facts,
the
factual
material.
now
that
does
not
mean
that
he
--
that
client
may
not
refer
to
public
records
such
as
the
judgment
of
naturalization
or
petition
for
naturalization
which
might
be
in
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
don't
think
any
would
be
--
that
there
is
any
number
required.
i
think
the
government
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
well
when
--
that's
what
the
government
argues
that
because
the
statute
says
it's
on
affidavit.
that
means
that
it
must
be
on
one
affidavit.
i
think
that
is
a
strain
construction
of
the
statute
and
i
think
that's
more
than
one
affidavit
might
well
be
filed
if
the
government
wants
to
do
so.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
it
does.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
the
court
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
only
way
in
which
this
procedure
can
be
conducted
is
through
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
statute
by
the
filing
of
an
affidavit
and
thereupon
made
the
duty
of
the
district
attorney
to
proceed
in
a
case.
and
the
history
of
that
statute,
i
think,
reveals
the
reason
why
that
procedure
comes
necessary
why
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
a
prerequisite.
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case
i
think
the
court
set
forth
there
in
considerable
detail
that
only
--
the
procedure
and
only
if
the
procedure
set
forth
by
the
statute
is
the
one
which
can
be
followed
in
the
denaturalization
proceedings.
i
don't
think
that
a
district
attorney
may
proceed
under
this
statute
on
his
own.
now
in
the
five
minutes
that
left
to
me
i
see
that
i'm
going
to
be
unable
to
discuss
at
all
adequately
the
--
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
this
case
involving
illegal
procurement.
i
do
want
to
state
one
point
in
connection
with
fraud
however.
well
i
may
just
briefly
suggest
under
the
--
an
illegal
procurement.
the
government's
position
on
illegal
procurement
is
that
for
five
years
prior
to
his
naturalization,
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
because
of
the
organization
which
they
claim
it
was
and
which
it's
supported
by
testimony
introduced,
therefore,
he
could
not
have
been
and
was
not
a
person
attached
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
if
the
--
we
--
i
will
not
even
touch
upon
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
that's
discussed
at
great
length
in
our
brief.
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
make
this
one
point,
the
government
claim
--
it
is
our
main
contention
that
a
doctrine
res
judicata
applies
to
the
judgment
insofar
as
attachment
is
concerned.
and
the
government's
main
position
on
that
is
that
because
there
are
number
of
cases
decided
by
this
court
over
a
period
of
years
which
held
that
under
the
claim
of
illegal
procurements,
a
naturalization
judgment
maybe
set
aside
such
as
a
failure
of
certificate
of
arrival,
no
hearing
in
open
court,
racial
ineligibility
and
so
forth.
therefore,
by
the
same
token,
the
judgment
as
to
attachment
may
also
be
attacked
on
the
ground
of
illegal
procurement.
it
is
our
position
that
with
respect
to
the
matters
that
i
have
referred
to
in
these
other
many
decisions
these
are
jurisdictional
prerequisite
set
forth
in
the
statute
which
are
heavily
ascertainable
and
which
in
the
baumgartner
cases
the
court
held
for
specific
conditions
easily
established
where
the
attachment
is
one
which
involves
an
ultimate
judgment
which
is
not
of
a
kind
encompassed
in
these
decisions
and
therefore
must
be
one
which
the
court's
opinion
is
final
and
may
not
be
reassessed
at
a
later
date.
i
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
know
i
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
in
the
other
question
you
discuss
it.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
that
isn't
what
i
said.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
said
that
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
person
was
attached
to
the
constitution
is
not
the
same
kind
of
a
decision
as
to
whether
he
was
--
he
had
a
certificate
of
arrival
as
to
the
first.
i
think
it
is
a
judgment
as
to
an
ultimate
fact
which
is
final
and
which
may
not
be
reopened
because
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
nothing
is
final
i
suppose.
but
in
connection
with
the
judgment
of
naturalization
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
under
the
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
finality
of
the
judgment
--
the
judgment
is
final
with
the
exception
of
fraud,
common
law
fraud
and
secondly
with
regard
to
illegal
procurement.
illegal
procurement
we
say
are
the
lack
of
the
jurisdictional
prerequisites
to
the
exercise
by
the
court
of
its
power
to
act
in
such
cases.
one
of
those
is
not
attachment
because
attachment
is
a
final
determination
of
an
ultimate
fact.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well
certain
of
the
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
said
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
a
judgment
of
naturalization
maybe
attacked
in
one
of
two
manners
under
the
1940
act,
under
the
1952
act
only
in
one
way
but
under
the
1940
act
in
two
ways.
one,
by
fraud,
we
agree
if
there
is
a
sufficient
showing
of
fraud
under
the
common
law
doctrines
and
under
the
doctrines
applied
by
the
court,
you
can
take
away
a
citizenship
on
that
ground.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
no
that
is
not
fraud.
mr.
ernest
goodman
all
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
because
as
to
fraud,
the
claim
must
be
based
upon
a
fraudulent
--
well,
i
used
the
word
fraud
in
my
definition
but
fraud
itself
must
be
a
misrepresentation
of
a
material
fact
upon
which
the
government
has
relied
upon
and
it
must
be
extrinsic
rather
than
intrinsic
in
its
nature.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
hope
so.
i
didn't
intend
to
come
to
it
without
some
adequate
preparation
on
my
argument
but
i
--
i
finally
got
to
it
here.
i'm
through,
but
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
this
is
not
the
oath
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
the
petition
which
he
says
he
acts
as
a
person
who
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
--
for
five
years.
that's
different
than
the
oath.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
oath
is
in
a
different
category.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well
as
to
whether
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
it
could
not
--
on
the
question
of
attachment
to
constitution
that
if
he
answered
his
questions
correctly
and
the
prerequisites
to
the
statute
as
to
exercise
of
jurisdiction
were
all
present
and
he
was
rendered
his
citizenship
later
on,
the
court
could
not
go
back
on
a
denaturalization
proceeding
and
assert
that
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings,
he
was
in
fact
acting
as
a
spy
and
perhaps
later
convicted
for
it
unless
he
were
asked
questions
which
related
to
it
or
unless
congress
had
put
into
the
law
a
specific
provision
dealing
with
it
of
the
--
the
question
--
take
the
question
of
anarchist.
the
congress
has
put
anarchist
as
a
--
as
a
specific
statement
in
the
statute
borrowing
anarchist
from
being
citizen.
a
person
who
has
an
anarchist
may
not
become
a
citizen
and
it
makes
no
difference
as
to
whether
he
is
attached
in
fact
or
not
the
congress
has
said
so.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
that's
i
think
his
position
your
honor
took
in
his
opinion
in
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ernest
goodman
no
i
don't
think
the
court
came
to
that
issue
but
when
you
put
it
that
way
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
i
think
that
the
point
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
here
and
the
points
we
are
raising
here
have
been
favorably
passed
upon
by
the
court
and
asserting
the
schneiderman
case
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
evidence.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
and
under
--
in
our
case
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
all
right.
now
whether
the
court
intended
in
the
--
in
our
case
to
apply
the
rule
of
res
judicata
there
i
believe
--
my
interpretation
of
it
that
it
did.
i
leave
to
the
court
itself
the
determination
of
whether
it
construes
the
decision
that
way
or
not.
i
--
before
i
sit
down,
i'm
through,
i
see
the
light
but
i
wanted
to
just
mention
one
point.
in
this
brief
on
appeal
the
government
presents
for
the
first
time
the
issue
of
fraud
in
the
oath.
it
was
not
presented
by
the
government
in
the
brief
below.
it
was
not
argued
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
court
below
and
therefore
it
was
not
argued
or
briefed
by
us
at
all
in
the
court
below
or
here.
we
find
it
for
the
first
time
here.
we
do
not
think
it's
properly
in
the
case
on
appeal,
but
if
it
is,
we
certainly
don't
think
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
to
support
it
because
of
the
post
naturalization
record
of
this
particular
citizen
mr.
nowak
who
was
a
member
of
the
state
senate
for
five
years
so
completely
opposite
to
that
now
where
--
where
that
was
the
all
important
consideration.
but
if
the
court
does
feel
that
that
is
an
issue
in
the
case
at
all,
we
would
like
to
have
an
opportunity
of
filing
a
reply
brief
to
answer
because
we
don't
think
it's
an
issue
and
because
we
think
the
facts
not
justify
of
finding
the
fraud
in
the
oath
and
this
court
for
the
first
time.
