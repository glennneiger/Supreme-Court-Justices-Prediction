mr.
j.
f.
bishop
may
it
please
the
court.
despite
the
fact
that
there
apparently
been
some
narrowing
of
the
issues
to
say
nothing
of
concessions
i
think
that
surely
our
discussion
of
the
affidavit
will
be
a
cleaner
and
more
easy
to
follow
discussion
if
i
divide
it
very
sharply
into
two
questions
and
devote
myself
first
to
the
question
as
to
who
may
make
the
affidavit.
somewhere
in
the
petitioner's
brief
there
was
a
complaint
of
lack
of
personal
knowledge
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
we
address
ourselves
for
the
question
but
it's
a
legitimate
enough
question
of
the
court
as
well.
so
if
i
may,
i
want
to
warn
the
court
that
i'm
going
to
try
to
narrow
my
discussion.
first
to
the
question
of
who
may
make
this
affidavit,
in
other
words
is
--
is
it
an
insufficient
affidavit
because
it
is
made
by
one
who
is
not
an
eyewitness
of
anything.
i'm
--
i'm
concerned
about
that
question
as
a
remaining
question
as
well
because
in
the
cases
cited
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
by
way
of
analogy
in
some
of
the
search
cases,
there
was
an
array
of
those
earlier
cases
that
not
only
said
that
it
had
to
be
on
personal
knowledge
and
an
eyewitness
but
then
it
had
to
be
by
someone
who
would
be
legal
evidence.
now
that
--
those
cases
were
the
bases
on
a
second
round
of
some
cases
cited
by
petitioner
and
they
have
been,
i
think,
very
substantially
overruled
by
brinegar
and
the
like.
but
in
ascertaining
what
sort
of
an
affidavit
is
intended
here,
i
want
to
stay
away,
if
i
may,
from
the
question
of
how
much
should
he
have
said
some
more
was
this
enough.
i
want
to
address
myself
first
and
clean
up
the
question.
i
hope
in
accordance
with
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
concession
but
to
be
sure
that
the
court
has
no
lingering
doubts
about
the
fact
that
an
immigration
attorney
with
the
expertise
to
be
attributed
to
him
and
with
the
some
right
to
be
considered
honest
and
of
some
judgment
is
a
proper
person
to
make
his
affidavit
although
by
the
nature
of
the
case
he
couldn't
be
an
eyewitness
to
everything
that
occurred.
now
there
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
first
of
all
i
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
i
were
clear
that
the
court
agreed
by
then
i
could
dispense
with
that
part
of
the
argument
but
i'm
afraid
that
the
case
was
cited
upon
reviewing
the
brief
if
i
may
take
a
little
time
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
to
go
through
those
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
unless
there
be
a
lingering
doubt
and
also
because
it
will
differentiate
the
questions
of
how
much
more,
why
wasn't
this
enough,
how
much
should
he
tell?
now
that
is
narrowed
as
i
will
note
in
that
point
of
the
argument
that
we
need
not
fear
that
everything
has
to
be
put
in.
now,
with
that
in
mind,
i
want
to
attack
that
personality
problem,
the
person
who
is
to
do
it
in
the
orthodox
way
first
with
a
quick
look
at
the
statute,
secondly
with
a
look
at
the
contemporary
history
and
so
on
down
the
line.
as
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
says
affidavit.
now,
i
don't
want
to
put
too
much
story
on
the
fact
that
it
says
affidavit
in
the
senior
but
it
is
something
of
a
benchmark
that
the
congress
was
not
considering
the
string
of
affidavits
that
would
be
necessary
in
the
number
of
cases.
what
is
more
to
the
point
is
that
draftsmen,
when
they
do
consider
an
affidavit
that
has
to
be
on
personal
knowledge
can
do
so,
not
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
49.
we
have
set
forth
a
sample
of
the
type
of
draftsmanship
which
we
think
is
indicated
and
indeed
require
if
the
ordinary
definition
of
an
affidavit
is
to
be
departed
from.
that
is
an
affidavit
is
--
in
frequent
usage
made
on
information
and
belief.
when
it
is
not
to
be
that
when
people
are
to
be
dissatisfied
with
someone
else
as
it
was
said
using
the
judgment
and
the
like
the
language
is
that
set
forth
on
page
49
of
our
brief
which
i
read
here
in
rule
56
(e)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
that's
page
49
of
our
brief.
supporting
and
opposing
affidavit
shall
be
made
on
personal
knowledge
--
shall
set
forth
such
facts
as
would
be
admissible
in
evidence
and
shall
show
affirmatively
that
the
affiant
is
competent
to
testify
to
the
matter
stated
therein.
i
want
to
break
off
in
the
quotation
because
the
rest
of
the
quotation,
we
think,
also
proves
our
point
as
to
the
matter
of
attaching
copies
of
what
he
is
examining
because
this
rule
drifting
off
just
momentarily
into
the
other
facet
of
my
argument
says,
“sworn
or
certified
copies
of
all
papers
or
parts
thereof
referred
to
in
the
affidavit
shall
be
attached
thereto
or
serve
therewith.”
and
--
and
because
that
relates
to
the
other
part
of
my
argument
and
shows
what
draftsmen
do
when
they
expect
the
--
the
written
material
to
be
attached
they
say
it
specifically.
but
that
--
and
that
is
why
i
don't
want
to
read
that
in
at
this
time.
now,
departing
from
the
strict
matter
of
the
language,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
zucca
opinion
and
state
that
accepting
that
decision
in
good
grace,
we
not
only
look
at
it
for
its
limited
holding
in
that
case
as
the
court
will
of
course
recall,
no
affidavit
was
filed.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
not
what
should
be
in
an
affidavit
because
no
affidavit
was
filed
whatsoever
and
the
court
had
for
decision
the
question
whether
the
government
has
to
file
an
additional
affidavit.
now,
we
look
to
that
decision,
however,
in
all
sincerity
and
carefulness
to
see
whether
we
can
derive
some
benchmarks
from
it
from
our
guidance
as
to
what
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
should
be.
and
it
is
in
that
spirit
and
i
think
literally
in
that
language
that
this
court
said
that
it
was
not
looking
at
this
complaint
as
a
sample
or
not
a
sample
of
what
could
be
in
an
affidavit
but
rather
stated
that
in
modern
practice,
a
complaint
might
be
restricted
to
ultimate
facts
and
that
that
would
not
satisfy
the
rule
and
therefore
that
was
a
reason
for
holding
that
the
complaint
even
though
on
information
or
belief
or
had
it
been
sufficient
in
that
case
or
not.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
that
point
but
the
court
did
give
us
a
benchmark
which
we
think
is
extremely
pertinent
as
to
who
is
to
make
that
affidavit.
the
court
stated
at
page
98
and
we
put
the
quotation
on
page
51
of
our
brief,
“in
response
to
the
regrets
of
the
government
and
the
vigor
of
the
dissent
that
if
the
--
if
too
much
of
an
affidavit
were
to
be
required,
it
would
lead
to
a
virtual
morass
of
almost
impossible
proceeding.
and
to
that
this
court
responded
in
the
sense
that
not
too
much
would
be
required
and
it
said
“we
failed
to
see
that
the
requirement
imposes
a
burden
on
the
government”.
at
this
term,
it
has
been
represented
to
us,
that
was
the
minker
case,
that
the
usual
practice
is
that
if
sufficient
grounds
are
shown,
an
affidavit
showing
good
cause,
see
section
340
(a)
of
the
act,
is
prepared
and
executed
and
it
is
forwarded
as
an
aide
to
the
formal
judicial
proceedings.
and
then
the
court
cited
the
government
brief
in
minker
and
specifically
cited
page
34,
and
we
think
that
that
is
some
legitimate
benchmark
of
what
the
court
had
in
mind
as
being
a
sufficient
affidavit
and
that's
not
imposing
a
burden
on
the
government.
now
i
have
the
minker
brief
here
and
the
page
which
the
court
itself
cited.
it's
cited
at
page
34
and
i
read
what
i
think
was
of
course
patent
in
that
case
and
that
was
that
it
was
a
practice
in
the
immigration
service
to
provide
an
affidavit
of
an
attorney
of
the
immigration
service.
and
we
think
that
this
language
of
this
court
in
zucca
is
completely
persuasive
of
the
fact
that
that's
what
the
court
had
in
mind
and
that's
what
i
--
that
is
what
the
person
is
who
can
execute
that
affidavit
even
though
it
must
be
known
of
course
that
personal
knowledge
isn't
available
to
him
of
every
fact
that
occurred
there.
now
in
that
government
brief
that
is
referred
to
on
page
34,
the
court
--
the
government
pointed
out
to
the
court
and
said,
the
most
it
can
result
--
no.
it
said,
“the
most
it
can
result
from
the
investigation
is
an
interdepartmental
recommendation
that
good
cause
exist
to
institute
future
judicial
action.
this
investigative
procedure
is
in
no
sense
an
administrative
pretrial.”
and
then
this
additional
page
which
was
before
the
court
on
page
23
of
the
minker
government
brief
which
i
did
not
reproduce
in
the
brief
here.
it
says,
and
this
was
the
representation
of
the
government
to
the
court
as
to
what
we
were
doing
about
affidavits
and
which
we
think
the
court
said,
"well
that
doesn't
impose
a
burden."
here
it
is
“where
denaturalization
was
sought
on
the
ground
of
illegality
or
fraud,
it
was
the
bureau
--"
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
am
reading
from
page
23
of
the
minker
government
brief.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
am
sorry
that
i
didn't
add
this
quote.
it
should
have
been
--
well
let
me
distinguish.
this
is
--
this
is
an
additional
part
as
i
said
that
was
before
the
court.
the
court
cited
at
page
34
and
here
is
the
additional
language
from
23
which
the
court
did
not
cite
but
which
was
before
the
court
in
our
presentation
of
what
the
immigration
attorneys
were
doing.
“where
denaturalization
was
sought
on
the
ground
of
illegality
or
fraud,
it
was
the
bureau
which
usually
executed
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
which
was
forwarded
to
the
responsible
united
states
attorney
for
use
and
possible
judicial
proceedings.”
now
that
patently,
it
seems
to
us,
indicates
that
your
bureau
attorney
or
a
bureau
--
some
member
of
a
bureau
was
the
person
who
would
execute
the
affidavit
and
that
it
was
not
required
that
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
be
the
original
affidavit
of
prospect
and
witnesses
and
so
on.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
of
course
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
and
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
labor
the
point
but
i
do
want
to
finish
it
up
so
that
it
will
be
addressed
because
as
i
say
there
are
number
of
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
remarks
in
the
cases
that
were
cited.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
i
have
not
referred
to
our
brief
in
the
zucca
opinion.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
not
at
all.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
the
minker
brief
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
i
have
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
have
written
--
i
have
read
that
only
in
order
to
indicate
what
this
court
must
have
been
talking
about
when
it
said
we
see
it
fail
to
see
that
the
requirement
poses
a
burden
at
this
term
it
has
been
resented
and
represented
to
us
the
usual
practice.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
that
is
our
position.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
other
words,
there
was
the
narrow
question
and
the
remarks
in
the
opinion
to
which
we
give
attention
in
the
second
part
of
this
as
to
what
that
affidavit
should
contain
where
we
think
something
of
a
benchmark
sustaining
the
position
of
what
should
be
in
the
affidavit.
but
it
was
no
passing
on
the
complaint
because
the
court
would
not
accept
the
complaint.
the
court
resisted
our
own
--
our
own
efforts
to
say
that
the
complaint
avoided
any
harm,
that
resisted
zucca's
effort
to
show
that
--
then
it
was
insufficient
and
addressed
itself
to
the
narrow
issue
that
the
government
has
to
file
an
affidavit
and
it
is
not
just
restricted
as
we
sought
to
argue
to
the
case
of
an
outsider
seeking
to
force
the
government
to
act.
but,
they
--
as
i
say,
we
do
explore
that
opinion
because
that
is
perhaps
the
best
indication
of
--
we
have
of
what
the
court
said
would
be
available
in
an
affidavit
and
would
not
be
available
in
a
complaint.
and
that
we
interpret
the
court
to
say
not
that
the
complaint
in
zucca
was
not
enough
but
that
with
the
modern
practice
the
court
used
those
words,
modern
practice.
the
modern
practice
under
which
a
complaint
could
just
allege
ultimate
facts
in
some
cases
and
that
would
not
be
enough.
and
so
the
affidavit
serves
not
just
as
a
duplication
of
the
act
--
of
the
complaint
it
serves
for
this
court's
opinion
in
zucca
as
a
minimum.
in
other
words,
no
matter
what
you
put
into
your
complaint
or
what
you're
entitled
to
leave
out
of
your
complaint
this
much,
the
court
said,
you
must
put
into
your
affidavit
and
that
is
not
your
ultimate
facts.
in
this
case,
the
ultimate
facts
would
be
fraud
and
illegal
concealment
but
you
must
give
evidentiary
effects
to
show
that
you
are
not
--
we're
not
--
in
other
words,
we
are
not
interested
in
your
conclusions
which
are
virtually
conclusions
of
law
in
the
ultimate
fact.
we
are
interested
in
some
showing
of
how
that
came
to
pass
the
evidentiary
facts.
and
in
that
respect,
the
court
cited
two
cases
in
which
that
point
is
illustrated
those
were
the
salomon
cases
the
case
and
the
richmond
case.
and
in
those
cases
have
the
court
didn't
presented
with
only
a
complaint
stating
the
ultimate
fact
of
illegal
naturalization,
they
would
have
been
deprived
and
the
proceeding
might
have
been
instituted
or
carried
forward
on
a
basis
that
when
the
evidentiary
facts
in
that
case
to
with
the
judges
departure
from
the
room
for
awhile
in
one
of
the
cases
i
recall.
when
those
--
when
it's
amplified
enough
to
see
what
that
ultimate
fact
is
saying
then
the
affidavit
performs
its
function
of
enabling
the
court
to
see
whether
the
conclusory
material
or
the
facts
--
the
ultimate
facts
are
of
a
proper
type.
but
i
have
digressed
from
the
question
of
who
can
make
it
and
since
there
seems
to
be
some
agreement
not
only
of
counsel
but
of
the
court
that
the
person
who
makes
the
affidavit
does
not
have
to
be
the
eyewitness
and
indeed
in
most
cases
that
would
involve
a
whole
chain
of
that
affidavit
sometimes
practically
unobtainable.
i'll
take
my
chances
on
the
rest
of
the
brief
which
cites
the
contemporary
authority
at
least
going
back
to
the
origin
of
this
act.
when
attorney
general
bonaparte
accepted
the
affidavit
that
was
given
to
him
irrespective
of
the
question
of
how
much
detail
is
to
be
given,
he
certainly
accepted
the
statement
of
a
state
department
official
who
could
never
has
been
an
eyewitness
of
all
the
things
which
he
said
have
the
--
as
to
which
he
attest
the
genuineness.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
a
profitable
question
if
i
were
capable
of
answering
it
because
it
involves
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
contingencies
but
may
i
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
what's
that?
i
don't
believe
so
(voice

i
believe
that
this
court
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
court
said
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
you
have
the
issue
as
to
whether
an
affidavit
that
it
does
not
just
state
the
ultimate
fact
of
fraud
and
the
illegal
concealment
but
goes
on
and
states
very
precisely,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
case
is
about
and
what
any
judge
could
pass
on
as
to
whether
if
in
law
and
in
probability
of
fact
is
a
case
that
should
be
tried.
i
think
we
have
that
here.
in
other
words,
the
ultimate
facts
here
are
stated
that
is
that
there
was
fraud
and
illegal
concealment.
but
their
affidavit
surely
does
not
stop
there.
in
the
back
pages
of
our
brief,
the
affidavit
is
set
forth
at
length.
it
states
the
evidentiary
fact
that
the
fraud
consisted
of
his
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
that
communist
party
was
an
advocate
of
overthrow
of
government.
and
that
it
stated
specifically
the
time
of
membership
in
the
communist
party,
stated
a
great
amount
of
detail
as
to
what
the
specific
statements
were
that
were
made.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
even
a
matter
of
summary.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
think
that
would
still
be
in
the
immigration
service
at
the
moment.
you
mean
(voice

--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
would
be
--
ordinarily
the
district
attorney
i
accept
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
you
mean
after
the
commissioner?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
a
great
number
of
the
questions
would
come
to
the
criminal
division.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
--
if
the
facts
were
precise
(voice

--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
in
other
words
not
a
blanket
statement.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
like
this?
i
would
certainly
stand
on
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
someone
reliable
with
expertise.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would
say
that
if
it
was
full
as
this
affidavit
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
with
the
evidentiary
fact
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
didn't
cite
the
steele
case.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
surely.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
would.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
this
is
an
attorney
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
i
will
address
it
in
this
fashion
that
if
the
assistant
attorney
general
supervises
no
matter
how
indirectly
this
--
this
attorney
spicer
who
made
this
affidavit,
has
made
a
great
number
of
affidavits,
he
is
not
without
supervision.
i
cannot
assume
that
he
would
deviate
from
the
policy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
can
only
state
that
i
view
those
words
as
a
challenge
of
the
position.
the
words
personal
knowledge
had
to
be
(inaudible).
i
--
do
you
wish
me
to
continue?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
as
i've
stated,
it
seem
--
it
seem
to
me
that
the
disavows
and
the
discussions
here
allow
me
only
the
time
to
state
that
the
reading
of
this
affidavit
was
shown
that
it
departs
along
way
from
a
mere
statement
of
ultimate
facts.
that
it
shows
the
type
of
thing
on
which
a
court
could
pass.
it
does
not
show
whether
the
witnesses,
when
they
are
finally
tested
in
the
final
proceeding
are
going
to
be
found
correct
or
not,
but
we
submit
that
no
one
without
a
trial
and
a
cross-examination
could
determine
that
point
on
--
do
you
wish
me
to
take
any
time
on
the
res
judicata
point
but
it
will
require
five
minutes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
very
well.
on
the
res
judicata
point,
i
think
that
that's
stands
in
large
part
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
schneiderman
case.
i
want
to
point
out
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
douglas
that
that
statement
and
that
consideration,
we
think,
relied
on
large
part
on
a
different
form
of
statute
and
that
the
risk
of
just
one
bit
more
of
further
reading,
the
statute
at
that
time
stated
as
a
--
as
a
condition
of
naturalization.
the
finding
of
a
court
and
as
i
concede,
mr.
justice
douglas'
argument,
it
was
that
if
the
court
finding
was
entered
that
that
--
that
in
some
degree
indicate
that
the
problem
had
been
met
but
the
opinion
goes
on
and
state
--
the
language
at
that
time
was,
it
shall
be
made
to
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court.
but
as
i
pointed
out
on
the
footnote
at
schneiderman
320
u.s.
162,
footnote
2
this
provision
was
recast
by
the
act
of
march
2,
1929
into
the
form
where
now
this
point
of
attachment
to
the
constitution
is
stated
as
a
requirement
of
naturalization
which
cannot
be
set
aside
by
--
presumably
by
the
action
of
a
court
mistakenly
or
being
imposed
upon
deciding
to
the
contrary.
at
the
time
of
mr.
justice
douglas'
statement,
it
said
it
shall
be
made
to
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court.
well
that
satisfaction
had
been
held
in
schneiderman,
and
the
argument,
as
we
understand,
it
was
that
--
that
could
not
be
an
illegal
procurement.
that
requirement
had
been
met
but
it
is
no
longer
the
requirement.
now,
the
requirement
is
the
attachment
as
an
objective
fact
and
not
as
a
court
finding.
and
as
such,
if
it
is
proved,
then
the
court
can
no
more
re-legislate
for
congress
by
its
error
in
that
proceeding
or
by
being
defrauded
than
it
has
in
the
other
cases
where
some
perhaps
lesser
requirement
is
found
missing
like
the
filing
of
the
certificate
and
yet
in
those
cases,
the
court's
action,
even
though
contested
at
the
--
by
their
government
at
that
time,
could
not
be
set
--
could
not
be
held
res
judicata.
