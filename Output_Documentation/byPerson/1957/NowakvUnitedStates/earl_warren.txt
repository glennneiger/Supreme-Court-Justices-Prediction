chief

mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
isn't
that
stated
more
broadly
than
the
issue
raised
by
the
defendant
could
not
be
an
eyewitness?
the
counsel
says
that
he
doesn't
require
him
to
be
an
eyewitness
and
i
thought
he
stated
rather
clearly
what
he
thought
would
suffice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
said
it
was
--
it
was
something
like
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant
or
some
other
proceedings
of
that
kind
which
do
not
require
a
man
to
be
an
eyewitness
to
on
this
thing
but
it
does
require
them
to
show
proper
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
all
the
time
you
want.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant,
couldn't
you?
it
could
be
an
agent
of
the
government.
it
could
be
a
private
individual.
it
could
be
anybody
who
could
establish
probable
cause
by
the
affidavit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
it
will
hardly
be
at
rest
if
you
read
everything
you
wrote
in
your
brief
[laughter]
into
the
zucca
opinion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
your
minker
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
minker
brief
and
the
zucca
opinion
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
can
be
addressed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
disavowed
any
intention
to
determine
what
kind
of
an
affidavit
was
necessary
didn't
it
in
the
zucca
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
we'll
continue,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
better
argue
your
case.
you've
got
five
minutes
left.
