justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
mr.
goodman
whether
affidavits
by
persons
whose
statements
were
in
the
department
of
justice,
filed
on
the
basis
of
which
the
officer
made
the
affidavit
would
have
satisfied
your
criteria,
your
demands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
this
very
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
ought
not
to
be
necessary
to
assign
from
time
to
time
it
is
to
say
that
questions
don't
imply
any
--
any
argument
or
agreement
or
conclusion
so
i'd
like
to
put
to
you
these
questions.
what
this
gets
down
to
is
that
an
affidavit
by
a
government
official
that
i
have
examined
the
file
and
i
truthfully
give
the
following
hearsay
and
on
best
evident,
testimony
as
to
what
is
contained
in
the
--
in
the
file
of
the
department
of
justice
doesn't
carry
that
weight
which
would
justify
conclusion
that
he
did
that
there
are
the
documents
on
trial
which
he
abstracted
or
which
he
--
derivative
(inaudible)
--
which
he
do
the
meaning
and
that
he
fairly
do
the
meaning
of
things
in
the
file,
isn't
that
right?
that
where
it
gets
down
to,
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
except
that
it
has
the
assurance
of
a
person
carrying
the
authority
and
from
my
point
of
view
implied
the
responsibility
of
the
authority
that
i
had
faithfully
given
the
brief
in
abstract,
the
summary
for
what
i
find
is
a
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
is
there,
isn't
it?
and
therefore
the
attacks
that
you
make
or
the
inadequacy
that
you
find
is
that
it
isn't
enough
to
assume
the
government
official
who
makes
such
an
affidavit
and
authorized
by
some
chief
of
the
bureau,
whatever
it's
called,
attorney
general,
deputy
general.
a,
that
he's
confident
to
make
such
a
summary
of
what
is
in
the
file,
and
b,
that
he's
honest
as
well
as
competent.
that
a
--
i
should
say
that
first
that
he
is
a
man
of
--
that
he's
not
corrupt,
that
he's
trying
to
be
honest
in
summarizing
what
is
in
the
files
and
b
that
he
is
capable
of
making
such
a
summary.
that's
true
isn't
it?
that's
where
it
got
started.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
question
of
whether
he
has
a
good
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
in
light
of
that
that
you've
already
done.
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
affidavits
were
if
i
--
people
that
were
on
the
witness
stand
could
be
discredited
in
all
sorts
of
(inaudible)
if
these
affidavits
--
if
these
affidavits
are
the
primary
informant
or
(inaudible)
could
the
court
say
we
don't
believe
him
or
we've
heard
or
read
or
have
a
sufficient
ground
for
believing
there's
too
many
informers
are
not
to
be
credited?
he
couldn't
do
that,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
have
to
take
the
face
value
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
however
improbable
the
allegations
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
what
is
final?
the
fact
that
the
person
has
received
his
citizenship
can't
be
recanvassed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
that's
why
i'm
asking,
what
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
is
final?
i
don't
know.
what
is
final?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
father
was
naturalized
that
is
--
that
couldn't
be
canvassed
by
any
in
subsequent
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
what
is
final?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
mean.
is
the
--
is
the
determination
that
an
alien
who
received
the
judgment
to
obtain
a
favorable
judgment,
denaturalization
involves
a
judgment.
a
judgment
whereby
he
becomes
a
citizen
is
the
question
--
the
ingredients
which
led
the
judgment
that
he's
attached
conclusive
and
not
re-examinable
under
the
proceeding
of
denaturalization.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
defend
it.
just
tell
me
what
it
is
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
fraud
with
reference
to
his
claim
that
he
is
attached
is
that
open?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
hoping
that
is
going
to
bury
those
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
just
ask
you
to
make
--
to
be
sure
it
is
considering.
do
i
understand
that
when
a
man's
swearing
attached
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
oath,
that
affirmation
is
accepted
by
a
judge
and
looks
him
in
the
eye
and
says,
"this
is
an
honest
man."
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
requires
--
that
is
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
makes
that
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
that
you
can't
show
that
in
fact
at
the
time
he
was
a
spy
for
a
foreign
government
and
that
was
not
attached?
i
just
don't
argue
--
it
puzzles
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
very
clear
if
i
may
say
so,
but
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
your
views
have
some
support
in
the
opinions
expressed
by
individual
members.
i
was
wondering
whether
you're
offering
this
thing
as
something
justified
by
or
confirmed
by
our
opinion
or
something
that
you
want
the
court,
there'd
be
no
prior
expression
to
accept
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
quantum
of
proof.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
mr.
bishop.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
requirement
of
an
eyewitness
has
been
disavowed
by
--
could
you
state
--
and
sort
of
deal
about
this.
could
you
state
in
some
generalized
form
what
you
conceded
to
be
the
minimum
that
such
as
an
--
whose
affidavit
it
should
be
represented
by
function,
what's
the
minimum
of
its
content
should
be?
could
you
--
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
profitable
question
to
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
to
answer
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
issue
that
we
have
to
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
just
as
i
read,
bringing
out
some
illumination.suppose
the
department
made
it
a
practice,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
has,
will
or
should,
suppose
the
department
went
in
for
a
new
policy
to
wit
thereby
either
the
deputy
attorney
general
or
the
head
of
the
division
which
is
charged
of
this
matter,
is
that
criminal
division,
civil
naturalization,
denaturalization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
who
in
the
department
as
charge
of
matters
that
come
to
the
attention
of
the
department
dealing
with
denaturalization,
is
that
the
civil
division?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
mean
who
is
in-charge
when
you
come
into
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
suppose
it
made
a
rule
that
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
makes
every
affidavit
in
this
denaturalization
case.
the
department
conceiving
it
to
be
of
that
order
of
importance
instead,
i
hereby,
on
information
and
belief,
swear
that
the
following
factor
included
in
material
in
the
filing
of
the
department
and
then
gives
the
summary.
would
you
think
that
would
be
or
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
giving
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
then
it
says,
i
find
just
like
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
standing
rule,
we
could
take
judicial
notice
but
of
course
the
assistant
attorney
general
hasn't
examined
the
filing
itself
and
somebody
is
going
to
explore
it
and
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
someone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
you'd
say
that
was
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doesn't
get
down
whether
this
official.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
attach
weight
as
i
was
to
the
fact
--
the
deputy
attorney
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you'll
commend
to
this
court
to
attach
weight,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
will
you
be
good
enough
to
follow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
consequence
the
same
with
mine
--
of
mine
will
you
and
not
tell
me
what
you
did
and
what
have
you
decide.
assume
the
assumption
that
i
have
made
that
a
person
with
the
authority
of
an
assistant
attorney
general
files
such
an
affidavit.
would
you
regard
that
as
sufficient?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now
here
we
hadn't
gotten
an
assistant
attorney
general.
what
is
--
what
is
the
official?
what
is
his
rank?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
should
think
it
would
be
worthwhile
considering
the
very
candid
answer
that
mr.
goodman
made
that
if
the
individuals
themselves
whose
statements
are
in
files
made
the
affidavit
he,
i'm
not
talking
about
a
stopple,
he
thought
that
would
satisfy,
but
he
thought
that.
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
having
this
official
--
makes
some
reasons
on
concept
that
he
made
a
balance
summary
or
a
dependable
summary
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
morals,
having
to
do
with
the
capacity
to
summarize
which
most
people
haven't
got.
but
the
assistant
attorney
general
would
be
different,
wouldn't
he?
why
don't
you
address
yourself
to
the
problem
that
he
attended
to?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
case
here
before
us,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
have
to
go
into
all
these
surrounding
things,
the
susceptibility
of
past
brief,
future
brief,
what
was
worth
quoting,
what
wasn't
worth
quoting?
why
don't
we
contend
--
contain
ourselves
within
the
framework
of
this
concrete
case
insofar
as
it
tendered
a
general
principle?
