justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
congress
would
ever
any
power
in
connection
with
the
controversy?
maybe
that's
not
the
theory
here,
maybe
not
â€“-
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
on
the
merits,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
would
have
to
be
under
your
argument
wouldn't
it
that
when
maryland
passed
its
laws
repudiating
the
contract,
let's
suppose
that
virginia
had
brief
it
under
the
compact
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
claim
that
would
give
maryland
right
to
reach
in
advance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
repudiate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
that
would
be,
you
would
say
by
mutual
consent
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
claiming
that
maryland
taking
advantage
of
the
repudiation
of
the
contract
by
virginia
as
you
allege,
plus
your
activity
in
maryland
constitutes
a
repudiation
of
it
by
mutual
consent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
virginia
couldn't
repudiate
it
by
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
it
had
all
the
reasons
in
the
world,
it's
(inaudible)
contract
law
wouldn't
nullify
the
contact,
it
would
take
mutual
consent
of
the
parties,
wouldn't
it?
you
can
sue
them
for
the
breach.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
are
claiming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
the
issue
why
is
it
a
typical
case
for
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
a
typical
case
for
courts,
but
not
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
yesterday
under
this,
that
this
court
should
take
it,
but
should
wait
and
let
virginia
citizens
be
arrested
where
they
could
raise
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
each
individual
could
have
brought
a
suit
maybe
under
that
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
may
i
ask
you
this?
i
understand
that
you
said
that
you
in
effect
have
rescinded
the
contract
by
mutual
agreement
with
virginia.
they
did
it
first.
they
threw
down
the
(inaudible)
and
your
legislature
has
accepted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
has
to
be
determined
by
a
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
it
has
to
be
determined
by
a
court
in
which
neither
state,
if
which
one
state
is
not
a
party,
the
contract
made
by
the
state.
you
say
that's
it's
been
rescinded,
the
other
people
say
that
it
is
not,
and
if
somebody
has
to
try
it,
why
shouldn't
people
be
tried
to
be
the
two
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whoever
--
if
the
agreement
--
however
if
the
agreement
as
you
say
has
been
repudiated
by
the
states
themselves,
as
it
were
under
the
terms,
is
under
--
it's
disputed,
somebody
has
to
decide,
it
should
it
be
decided
when
both
states
are
not
parties,
and
how
can
both
states
be
parties
when
you
accept
here
or
in
a
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
say
they've
breached
it,
they
say
you've
breached
it,
and
you
say
it
ought
to
be
litigated
by
a
virginia
citizen
against
the
state
of
maryland.
