justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hicks
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
maryland
could
(inaudible)
repudiation
throws
a
cloud
of
titles
along
the
southern
shores?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
(inaudible)
on
title
is
only
as
regards
with
riparian
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
all
of
those
lands
along
the
southern
shore
a
private
ownership?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
along
the
lands
owned
by
virginia,
are
those
riparian
rights
were
of
any
particular
use
by
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
structures
built
into
the
river?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
structures
built
into
the
river,
piers
or
the
like?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
fishermen
and
oystermen
have
to
get
maryland
licenses,
only
those
who
are
regularly
engaged
in
the
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
suppose
i
sat
myself
with
a
pair
of
tongues
(inaudible)
west
virginia
went
on
to
river
to
tongue
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
i
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
we
could
say
that
isn't
it
that
every
virginian
who
wanted
to
make
use
of
the
river
would
have
to
have
a
maryland
license
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
he
is
in
the
business
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
can
you
really
say
that
this
is
limited
to
the
interest
of
800
odd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
you
this
all
started
with
joint
legislation,
anti-
dredging
legislation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
virginia
repeal
it's
(inaudible)
purport
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
could
otherwise,
under
the
compact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
except
that
i
take
it
legally
there
is
still
subsistence,
the
joint
legislation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
answer
to
when
is
that
it's
after
the
1946
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
answered
the
chief
justice
with
--
you
thought
virginia
might
adopt
this
kind
of
legislation
requiring
citizens
of
maryland
to
take
out
virginia
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
did
not
correctly
understand
you
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
requiring
maryland
citizens
to
take
out
these
licenses,
you
would
have
been
happy
at
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
that
legislation
have
a
provision
that
it
shall
be
effective
only
upon
the
concurrence
of
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
maryland
legislation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
say
i
gather
that
maryland
not
only
considers
it
effective
but
in
fact
its
proceeding
under
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
it
then
merely
a
proper,
i
don't
quite
understand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
it's
really
a
proper
until
its
acceptance,
it
would
not
be
effective?
