mr.
kenneth
c.
patty
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
that
my
colleague,
my
assistant
mr.
hicks
has
fully
developed
the
essential
question
involved
here
and
that
i
deem
it
unnecessary
this
time
to
go
into
the
case
any
further
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
(inaudible)
we
feel
that
unless
there
is
a
controversy
existing
on
the
count
of
the
breach
of
contract
to
the
breach
of
compact
that
compact
never
was
anything
more
than
a
scrap
of
paper
that
if
--
if
it
was
a
contract,
certain
controversy
has
risen
between
the
two
states
on
the
count
of
fact
that
one
state
has
attempted
to
unilaterally
abrogate
the
terms
of
the
contract.
