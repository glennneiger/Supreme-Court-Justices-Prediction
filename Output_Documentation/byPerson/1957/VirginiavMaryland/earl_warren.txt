chief

page
six
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask,
may
i
ask
going
back
to
that
page
26?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
do
with
the
last
sentence
on
that
page,
which
says
this
law
shall
never
be
repealed
or
ordered
by
the
legislature
of
this
government
without
the
consent
of
the
government
of
virginia,
that's
the
act
of
maryland
i
take
it
that
confirmed
the
compact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
do
you
do
with
that
language
in
view
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
court
would
judge
that
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
as
you
say
that
the
rights
under
this
compact
were
under
the
citizens
of
virginia,
distinguished
from
the
state
and
there
was
a
breach
by
maryland,
how
could
it
be
remedied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
may
i
ask
one
more,
one
more
question
please
you
say
it
is
one
of
your
arguments
that
this
contract
--
this
compact
is
not
live
today.
when
it
did
become
extinct
by
reason
of
your
1956
act
or
the
constitution
or
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
do
we
find
these
--
where
do
we
find
these
facts
that
you
are
just
telling
us
about
in
the
papers
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
these
things
all
conceded
by
virginia,
do
they
agree
with
you
that
these
are
the
facts
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
are
they
going
to
deny
them,
in
this
argument
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
it
clearly
--
doesn't
that
clearly
go
to
merits
of
why
virginia
should
not
have
the
relief
they
ask
for,
rather
than
to
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
that
involved
in
the
georgia
tennessee
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
suppose
virginia
had
taken
the
action
that
you
took,
would
she
have
had
the
right
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
just
say
that
she
did
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
same
action
that
you
took.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
you
might
be
happy
but
would
there
be
any
justiciable
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
asked
him
to
note
here
that
your
own
act,
proving
the
compact
says
that
it
shall
be
forever
faithfully
and
(inaudible)
observed,
now
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
forever
is
forever,
no
matter
what
statutes
you
find
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
compact
is
now
at
an
end
and
your
statute
is
enforceable,
there
is
no
inhibitions
in
the
state
at
all,
they
can
do
anything
they
want,
so
far
as
the
citizens
of
virginia
are
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
there
is
no
compact
they
can
change
tomorrow,
can
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes,
that's
a
little
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
don't
find
any
of
that
in
this
record,
really
i
don't
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
determine
this
issue
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
attorney
general
sybert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
years
after
that,
a
100
years
after
that
your
state,
your
state
recognized
that,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
before
you
leave
that
who
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
that
has
been
breached
or
whether
--
whether
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
said
compact
has
been
kept,
who
has
the
right
to
determine
that
this,
the
individual
states
unilaterally
or
a
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
what
you
here
arguing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
didn't
wait
for
them
to
take
a
stand,
you've
go
ahead
and
you've
licensed
them
and
you'll
arrest
them
if
they,
if
they
fish
without
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
can
you
say,
how
can
you
say
you
are
waiting
for
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
gentlemen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
hicks,
any
rebuttal?
attorney
general
patty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
