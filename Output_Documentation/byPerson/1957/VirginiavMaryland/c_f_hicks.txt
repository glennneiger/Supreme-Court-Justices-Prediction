mr.
c.
f.
hicks
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
the
argument
before
the
court
today
is
about
the
latest
in
a
series
of
events
which
are
concerned
with
potomac
river
for
approximately
350
years.
ever
since
the
grant
was
made
to
lord
calvert,
the
lord
baltimore
by
the
king
of
england
in
1632,
there
has
been
dispute
between
virginia
and
maryland
as
to
the
potomac
river.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right
your
honor.
it
has
been
peaceful
and
time
in
and
time
out
it
will
flare
up
again.
in
1776,
the
independence
of
the
colonists,
the
two
states
became
sovereigns
it
flared
up
in
one
of
these
intermittent
times
and
finally
in
1784
the
two
states
each
appointed
commissioners,
two
from
virginia
and
three
from
maryland
met
at
mount
vernon
in
march
1785
and
these
five
commissioners
drew
up
what
i
will
refer
to
today
as
the
compact.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
think
it
is
just
so
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
commissioners
were
outstanding
men
from
the
two
states.
there
was
--
one
of
the
commissioner
was
appointed
by
virginia
was
james
madison.
he
was
the
--
he
was
not
president
when
the
compact
was
growing
up
but
samuel
chase
of
maryland,
george
mason
of
virginia,
the
author
of
bill
of
rights,
both
of
these
men
were
men
were
among
commissioners.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
he
was
appointed,
but
he
did
not
actually
serve
at
the
time
the
compact
was
drawn.
he
was
appointed
as
one
of
the
commissioners
but
he
did
not
meet
with
the
commissioners
at
mount
vernon
1785.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
george
mason.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
and
alexander
henderson
and
from
maryland
samuel
chase,
thomas,
daniel
of
st.
thomas
jenifer
and
thomas
stone,
these
five
were
the
five
commissioners.
now
the
main
thing
that
virginia
had
instructed
its
commissioners
to
seek
when
they
met
with
the
commissioners
from
the
state
of
maryland
was
ownership
in
the
southern
shore
of
the
potomac
river
in
virginia
and
in
its
citizens
with
full
right
of
navigation,
commerce
and
fishery
in
the
river
proper.
the
main
thing
that
the
state
of
maryland
had
instructed
its
commissioners
to
seek
was
free
and
unrestrained,
untaxed
navigation
for
its
vessels
in
commerce
through
the
virginia
capes.
when
the
compact
was
drawn
up
each
state
got
it
what
it
desired
and
what
it
sought
and
in
1786
each
state
by
their
general
assembles
sitting
respectively
in
annapolis
and
richmond
ratified
and
confirmed
the
compact
of
1785
as
drawn
up
and
presented
to
them
by
these
five
commissioners.
the
compact
contained
13
paragraphs
or
provisions.
paragraphs
one
through
six,
nine
and
12
dealt
with
the
respective
rights
of
navigation
and
commerce
between
the
two
states
on
the
potomac
river
and
on
the
chesapeake
bay.
paragraph
seven
and
eight
relate
to
property,
riparian
and
fishing
rights
and
regulations
on
the
potomac
river
and
on
the
pocomoke
river.
paragraph
10
related
to
--
or
relates
to
criminal
jurisdiction
on
the
potomac,
pocomoke
and
chesapeake
bay.
paragraph
11
concerns
civil
jurisdiction
over
these
same
bodies
of
waters
and
the
ports
thereon.
paragraph
13
provides
how
the
compact
was
to
become
effective
and
how
it
was
to
be
ratified
and
the
effect
of
it
once
it
had
been
ratified
by
the
two
contracting
states.
now
although
the
compact
gave
the
virginia
and
its
citizen's
full
property
rights
in
the
southern
shores
of
the
potomac
river,
there
was
still
a
dispute
from
time
to
time
as
to
the
actual
location
of
the
boundary.
and
this
was
not
definitely
determined
--
the
boundary
was
not
definitely
surveyed
and
determined
until
1877
in
the
black-jenkins
award
when
the
arbitrators
black
and
jenkins
one
from
georgia,
and
one
from
pennsylvania
stated
that
in
view
of
the
compact
and
view
of
the
acceptance
of
the
compact
by
both
states
and
the
associates
of
each
state
that
it
was
undisputable
that
the
boundary
was
fixed
at
the
low
water
mark
on
the
southern
shore.
however,
that
they
would
describe
it
by
points
of
longitude
and
latitude
and
by
point
description
and
also
provided
that
it
would
not
fall
on
the
indentations
of
coves
and
bays
but
it
would
run
from
headland
to
headland
on
southern
shore.
now
there
have
been
from
time
to
time
violations
of
the
laws
on
the
potomac
by
the
both
the
citizens
of
virginia
and
the
citizens
of
maryland.
these
laws,
up
until
this
year,
have
been
enforced
on
the
river
relating
to
fishery,
have
always
been,
with
the
mutual
consent
and
approbation
by
the
legislatures
of
both
state.
last
fall
unfortunately
there
was
again
a
flare
for
trouble
between
law
of
enforcement
officials
and
citizens,
especially
citizens
of
a
certain
section
of
virginia.
and
my
just
in
sad
remark
say
that
three
--
four
citizens
of
virginia
who
were
arrested
by
maryland
officials
have
been
extradited
to
maryland
and
one
has
been
tried
and
the
other
three
are
waiting
trial,
but
winter
of
this
year
in
maryland
general
assembly
met
in
minneapolis.
it
passed
two
statutes
both
of
which
is
contention
of
virginia
invades
and
violates
the
rights
of
virginia
which
were
given
to
the
state
of
virginia
by
the
compact
of
1785.
the
first
one
of
these
statutes
is
chapter
766
of
the
laws
of
maryland
of
1957.
this
chapter
after
setting
up
intention
of
legislature
to
repeal
the
compact
did
repeal
the
enacting
statute
of
maryland
chapter
one
of
1785
which
in
effect
repealed
by
maryland
or
was
attempted
unilateral
repeal
by
maryland
to
repeal
the
compact
of
1785.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir.
the
compact
--
section
13
of
the
compact
and
the
enacting
clause
of
the
compact
provided
that
it
could
be
changed
by
the
mutual
consent
and
approbation
of
two
states.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
in
my
brief
one
place
it's
found
on
page,
pages
32.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir,
the
compact
has
been
printed
in
its
entirety
two
times
as
appendix
to
the
bill
of
complaint,
once
as
enacted
by
virginia
and
secondly
as
enacted
by
maryland.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
pages
32
and
33
of
the
bill
of
complaint,
not
the
briefs,
but
the
bill
of
complaint
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
paragraph
13,
number
13
these
articles
shall
be
laid
before
legislatures
of
virginia
and
maryland
and
upon
the
approbation
being
obtained
shall
be
confirmed
and
ratified
by
law
of
each
state
in
order
to
be
repealed
or
altered
by
either
without
the
concern
of
the
other.
so
there
was
a
provision
as
to
how
it
could
be
changed
or
repealed
by
mutual
consent
and
then
the
enacting
clause
of
respective
legislatures
also
carried
out
same
thing.
chapter
13
--
i
mean
article
13
was
in
the
compact
as
drafted
by
the
commissioners.
ii
on
33
is
the
clause
as
found
in
the
back
pass
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
maryland
and
on
page
26
as
a
clause
which
is
to
same
effect
except
for
the
interchange
in
the
words
virginia
and
maryland
as
passed
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
--
page
26
is
as
passed
by
the
general
assembly
of
maryland,
page
33
as
passed
by
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
the
second
statute
enacted
by
legislature
or
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
this
present
year
is
chapter
770
of
the
acts
of
maryland
of
1957,
which
act
in
the
language
used
by
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
legislature
of
that
state
in
passing
that
statute
provides
as
follows,
“that
it
is
a
legislative
intent
in
the
enactment
of
this
law
to
vest
in
state
of
maryland
all
licensing
provisions
concerning
the
taking
of
fish
or
oysters,
crabs
and
plants
from
potomac
river
to
give
to
the
state
of
maryland
and
its
law
enforcement
officers
complete
control
and
jurisdiction
over
such
fishes
in
the
potomac
river
and
to
give
the
residents
of
virginia
an
equal
right
citizens
of
maryland
and
use
enjoyment
of
such
fishes
to
be
exercised
solely
under
the
laws
of
state
of
maryland.
now
this
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
provision
of
article
8
of
a
compact
which
provided
that
any
laws
and
regulations
for
the
preservation
of
fish
in
potomac
river
should
be
enacted
with
mutual
consent
and
approbation
of
the
legislatures
of
each
state.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
the
issues
we
feel
is
one,
was
a
compact
of
1785
a
binding
contract
and
if
that
is
a
binding
contract
then
can
it
be
repealed
by
the
sole
unilateral
action
of
one
state
as
evidenced
by
the
state
of
maryland
in
this
present
year
enacting
primarily
chapter
766
of
the
laws
of
maryland
and
secondarily
by
carrying
out
its
intentions
by
enacting
chapter
770
of
the
laws
of
maryland.
that
is
a
primary
question
that
we
feel
is
before
this
court
and
that
is
this
on
this
motion
to
leave
to
file,
was
this
compact
a
contract
and
if
it
was
a
compact,
this
is
a
--
contract,
this
is
action
by
maryland
attempted
breach
or
a
repudiation
of
it
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
provides
that
no
state
may
enact
any
laws
which
impair
the
obligation
of
a
contract.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
you
must,
if
you
agree
that
there
is
a
contract
and
agree
that
these
statutes
by
maryland,
are
repudiated.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
it
is
our
contention
that
it
does,
and
that
this
state
has
taken
original
jurisdiction
in
many
instances.
in
fact
we
can't
find
anywhere
it
hasn't,
where
there
is
contract.
there
has
been
many
cases,
where
the
state
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
we
think
that
in
a
case
such
as
this
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir,
well
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
our
position
because
we
feel
in
this
case
a
court
of
law
couldn't
handle
it
because
there
is
no
way
to
determine
damages
for
a
breach
of
contract.
ordinarily
between
two
private
parties
there
can
be
for
breach
of
contract
there
might
not
be
a
(inaudible)
performance
release,
there
will
be
damages,
but
we
can't
conceive
how
in
a
case
such
as
this,
of
a
compact
between
two
states
dealing
with
the
use
of
a
river,
that
a
court
of
law
could
fix
liquidated
damages.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
we
do,
yes
sir,
we
like
that's
part
of
it
too,
but
we
think
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
before
we
actually
come
in
and
prove
the
amount
of
damages
that
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
feel
that
it
must
exercise
its
jurisdiction,
that
as
early
as
the
cases
of
fletcher
versus
peck
and
green
versus
biddle,
the
court
held
that
when
there
was
appearing
of
obligation
of
a
contract
by
the
laws
of
one
state,
even
though
that
state
may
have
been
a
party
to
the
contact,
then
not
only
was
it
the
authority
of
this
court,
but
that
it
was
the
duty
of
this
court.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that
wholeheartedly.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
as
to
this
case
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
we'll
cover
that.
now
i
feel
that
the
compact
of
1785
has
been
long
recognized
by
the
court
and
by
the
courts
of
both
states
and
by,
in
fact
all
of
the
courts
of
the
land
before
which
the
question
has
come
as
being
a
binding
contract
and
full
force
and
effect
upon
the
two
states
and
that
up
until
this
year
no
one
has
questioned
the
validity
of
this
compact
or
its
obligations
there
under.
the
high
court
of
the
state
of
maryland
in
a
fairly
recent
case
of
barnes
versus
state,
186
maryland,
287
recognized
the
compact.
this
court
in
wharton
versus
wise
153
u.s.
155
and
in
marsh
versus
united
states,
174
u.s.
196
and
in
maryland
versus
west
virginia,
217
u.s.
577
have
all
held
that
the
compact
was
binding
upon
the
two
states,
have
held
that
the
compact
did
fix
and
effect
the
boundary
as
meaning
at
the
low
watermark
on
the
southern
shore,
because
when
it
gave
virginia
and
its
citizens
full
property
rights,
in
the
southern
shore
of
the
potomac
river
and
when
maryland
assented
to
this,
this
in
effect
did
fix
the
boundary,
although
it
wasn't
until
later,
approximately
100
years
later
an
actual
survey
and
point
to
point
description
of
the
boundary
was
made
in
the
black-jenkins
award.
now
this
court
in
a
case
of
kentucky
versus
indiana,
281
u.s.
163,
which
dealt
with
a
contract
between
the
states
of
kentucky
and
indiana
for
the
building
of
a
bridge
between
the
two
states.
indiana
wanted
to
carry
out
its
contract,
but
a
group
of
its
citizen
instituted
a
suit
in
a
state
court
attempting
to
stop
the
state
of
indiana
from
carrying
out
its
contract
and
kentucky
invoked
the
original
jurisdiction
on
this
court.
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
hughes
said,
the
state
of
indiana
while
desiring
to
performance
its
contract,
is
not
going
on
with
its
performance
because
of
a
suit
brought
its
citizens
in
its
own
court.
there
is
thus
a
controversy
between
the
states
although
a
limited
one.
in
a
controversy
with
respect
to
a
contract
between
states,
as
to
which
original
jurisdiction
that
this
court
has
invoked,
this
court
has
the
authority
and
the
duty
to
determine
for
itself
that
pertaining
to
the
obligations
of
the
contract
(inaudible)
where
the
states
themselves
are
before
this
court
for
determination
of
the
controversy
between
them,
neither
can
determine
their
rights
(inaudible)
and
this
court
must
pass
upon
every
question
of
central
such
determination.
now
with
respect
to
the
whole
--
the
question
now
before
this
court
is
of
much
greater
magnitude
than
one
bridge
over
really
between
two
states.
the
question
before
this
court
now
is
the
right
of
virginia
and
its
citizens
to
equal
use
of
the
potomac
river,
a
river
which
exists
as
a
boundary
of
virginia
for
over
100
miles
and
that
the
compact
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right
your
honor
and
also
that
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no,
in
addition
that
virginia
fisherman
must
get
a
license
and
that
virginian
fisherman
must
comply
with
laws
passed
by
the
state
of
maryland
for
regulation
of
fishery
which
are
not
presented
to
by
virginia
and
thirdly
that
the
officials
of
maryland
have
sole
authority
and
jurisdiction
over
potomac
river
and
that
fishery
officials
of
the
state
of
virginia
who
have
been
patrolling
the
river
for
these
172
years
no
longer
have
any
authority
to
patrol
the
river
and
make
arrest
of
consent
of
concurrent
laws.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
feel
that
a
sample
illustration
of
this,
is
suppose
that
a
and
b
were
each
given
a
tract
of
land
adjacent
to
each
other
by
a
common
grantor.
and
there
was
some
conflict
as
to
the
boundary
between
those
two
tracts
of
land
and
has
apartment
house
on
that
boundary
line
and
as
astute
between
the
two
parties
a
and
b
as
to
who
has
the
ownership
of
that
apartment
house
and
they
finally
agree
that
the
land
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
apartment
for
belong
to
b,
but
that
a
can
have
full
use
of
one
floor
of
the
apartment
house
can
lease
of
it
out
to
any
tenants
that
he
wants
to,
upon
their
making
rental
agreements
with
them,
but
that
as
to
agreements
for
the
upkeep
of
the
house
and
agreements
for
regulation
of
the
tenants
as
to
noise
and
things
of
that
nature,
it
shall
be
those
which
are
agreed
upon
by
both
a
and
b.
and
then
b
comes
in
and
tells
a,
i
don't
like
some
of
you
tenants
therefore
i
am
not
going
to
put
him
out,
but
from
now
on
they
will
have
to
pay
all
their
rent
to
us,
b
and
they
also
have
to
agree
with
whatever
we
say
and
you
have
no
more
say,
except
your
tenants
can
still
stay
in
here
and
that's
the
same
thing
we
have
now.
maryland
has
said
we
are
repudiating
the
contract,
but
we
are
going
to
be
generous,
we
are
going
to
let
your
citizens
still
use
the
river
as
long
as
they
buy
our
licenses,
as
long
as
they
comply
with
our
laws,
as
long
as
they
obey
our
fishery
officials,
your
fishery
officials
have
no
more
say
over
the
river.
your
legislature
has
no
more
say
over
trying
to
preserve
the
oysters,
and
shell
fish
and
thin
fish
in
the
river.
so
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
think
your
honor
that
the
two
states
under
the
compact
laws
could
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no,
your
honor
the
compact
leaves
(inaudible)
the
question
of
licensing,
so
therefore
that
comes,
if
it's
a
regulatory
license
which
i
think
that
this
license
of
fishery
is,
it's
$10
or
$15
license
if
it's
a
regulatory
license,
than
it
is
a
license
dealing
with
the
preservation
of
fish
in
the
river.
and
any
license
provisions
have
to
be
mutually
concurred
in
and
consented
to
by
the
legislatures
of
both
states.
now
what
has
been
concurred
in
by
the
legislatures
of
both
states
in
the
past
is
virginia
citizens
comply
and
purchase
a
license
from
virginia.
maryland
citizens
comply
with
and
purchase
a
license
from
the
state
of
maryland
up
until
june
the
1st
of
this
year.
after
june
the
1st
of
this
year
maryland
officials
came
to
our
citizens
facing
in
the
river
and
told
them
that
if
you
don't
have
a
maryland
license
you
will
be
arrested,
you
will
be
tried,
you
will
subject
to
fine
and
imprisonment.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
so
you
have
a
license
from
virginia
and
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
not
in
the
bill
of
complaint,
but
quite
honestly
when
various
local
commonwealth
attorneys
called
us
up
and
asked
our
advice
we
told
them
to
give
advise
to
their
citizens
to
comply
with
the
maryland
laws
temporarily
and
buy
a
license
in
order
to
not
have
their
boats
be
subject
to
forfeiture
and
not
lose
a
day's
work
while
being
carried
into
maryland
courts,
since
it
was
a
nominal
sum,
and
while
we
were
determining
whether
maryland
could
take
over
complete
control
of
the
river.
now
the
thing
that
bothers
virginia
is
not
so
much
right
now
of
a
nominal
$10
or
$15
license.
but
if
the
state
of
maryland,
can
abrogate
the
compact
and
levy
a
license
on
our
citizens,
without
the
consent
of
virginia,
the
next
thing
they
can
do
is
come
along
and
deny
them
rights
to
fishery
entirely
in
the
river.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
we
feel
that
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
we
feel
your
honor
that
it
would,
the
same
way
that
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
even
though
it
takes
no
action,
that
there
is
several
things,
one
thing
it
puts
a
cloud
on
title,
the
virginia
shores
of
certain
residents
along
virginia,
the
second
thing
it
does
it
puts
a
question
as
to
jurisdiction
of
the
laws
of
the
two
states
on
the
potomac
river,
the
third
thing
it
does
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
fishery
officials
of
the
various
--
of
the
two
stations
to
enforce
the
laws,
just
that
decoration
by
itself.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
just
recommended
it,
well
that
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
just
recommended
without
concrete
legislative
action
would
not
and
we
don't
think
at
any
--
this
was
just
the
action
by
a
maryland
official
in
arresting
one
of
our
citizens,
without
this
action
by
the
legislature,
then
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
reason
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
as
this
court
said
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
--
texas
versus
louisiana
or
louisiana
versus
texas.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
vague,
and
also
this
court
has
said
that
a
state
cannot
come
in
and
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court
just
to
vindicate
its
grievances
against
the
mal-administration
of
a
sister
state's
laws
by
an
official
of
that
state,
but
we
have
more
than
that
here.
we
have
the
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
honestly
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
honestly
believe
your
honor,
that,
that
would.
i
think
this
case
is
more,
because
we
have
a
second
statute
carrying
out
that
intention,
we
also
have
the
law
enforcement
officers
carrying
out
that
intention,
but
i
think
just
that
alone,
when
you've
got
a
contract,
you've
got
a
contract
between
two
parties
and
one
goes
to
the
other
and
says
i'm
no
longer
honoring
that
contract,
the
contract
was
over
with,
well
then
there
is
a
breach
of
the
contract.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
not
without
there
being
damage
on
the
state
of
virginia.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
missouri
versus
illinois?
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right
your
honor,
but
in
that
case
you
invoke
jurisdiction
and
then
went
on
the
questions
on
the
merit
and
that's
what
we
are
asking
before
your
honors
now,
is
that
we
think
we
have
shown
enough
in
our
bill
of
complaint
to
invoke
jurisdiction.
now
maybe
when
the
case
gets
to
the
court
on
the
merge
and
the
evidence
was
put
in
by
both
sides
when
the
court
requires
evidence,
then
maybe
it
might
be
a
showing
that
there
is
not
sufficient
damage
for
the
court
to
make
an
award
to
either
state,
but
we
feel
that
in
this
case
where
there
is
a
long
standing
contract
and
where
we
have
laws
enacted
by
both
states,
which
our
court
didn't
take
judicial
notice
of,
which
are
carried
as
exhibits
to
the
bill
of
complaint,
providing
for
the
regulation
of
fishers,
and
those
laws
carry
with
it
officials,
fishery
officials
of
each
state
patrolling
the
river
and
making
arrest,
they
carry
with
it
a
licensing
issue
by
the
respective
states
to
their
respective
citizens.
the
compact
also
carries
in
addition
to
fisheries,
it
carry
certain
riparian
rights.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
it's
not
just
--
it's
the
fish
industry.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
what
this?
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
what
this
action
of
maryland
in
acting
these
two
statutes
provides
specially
in
the
acting
of
the
second
statute
of
chapter
770
is
that
all
virginia's
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
there
are
over
800
fishermen
who
are
residents
of
virginia,
who
rely
upon
to
the
potomac
river
as
the
major
source
of
their
livelihood.
this
includes
oystermen,
people
who
take
clams
and
crabs
and
thin
fish.
heretofore
people
have
known
that
if
they
comply
with
the
license
statutes
of
virginia
that
they
had
a
right
to
use
the
potomac
river.
now
they
must
--
under
this
action
comply
with
the
licensing
laws
of
maryland,
they
also
much
comply
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that
requires
that
they
purchase
a
license
from
the
state
of
maryland
to
the
exact
amount
of
which
for
each
one
i
would
honest
with
your
honors
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
it's
a
regulatory
license
fees
of
a
normal
sum
of
$5
to
$10.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
per
year.
but
it
also
--
there
are
at
least
two
patrol
boats
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
with
five
enforcement
officers
on
the
potomac
river
year
around.
there
are,
during
the
oyster
season
at
least
four
and
frequently
more
patrol
boats
with
ten
enforcement
officers
on
the
potomac
river,
the
state
of
virginia
spends
over
$100,000
a
year
paying
for
these
patrol
boats,
because
it
feels
that
it
has
a
duty
and
obligation
to
preserve
the
fish
and
the
river
and
the
oysters
and
to
see
that
the
laws
are
carried
out,
as
given
to
it
under
the
compact.
now
this
action
by
maryland
would
take
--
leave
those
people
without
any
jurisdiction.
when
one
of
our
men
makes
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
they
are
not
forbidden
in
the
waters
but
they
are
forbidden
by
chapter
770
jurisdiction
to
arrest
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
--
to
arrest
and
patrol
and
to
enforce.
now
i
don't
think
a
citizen,
they
can't
put
their
boat
on
the
water,
but
it
says
that
they
can't
carry
any
duties
once
they
were
there,
that
that's
vested
solely
in
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
maryland
patrol
boats
should
take
their
place
and
would
take
over
completely,
and
what
we
feel
is
even
more
of
a
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
mainly,
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
they
would
have
an
interesting
to
protect
the
fisheries,
but
each
state
has
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
and
virginia
wants
to
look
after
its
interest
as
well
as
maryland
and
after
its
own.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
there
is
none
whatsoever.
there
is
this
difference
your
honor
though
that
formally
a
person
purchased
the
license
from
virginia
was
good
for
other
waters
and
good
for
potomac
river.
and
maryland
i
am
not
sure
whether
the
purchase
of
just
a
license
of
potomac
river
is
not
good
other
waters
than
that,
but
it
does
mean
that
virginia
residents
have
to
purchase
two
licenses,
whereas
residents
of
maryland
just
have
to
purchase
a
maryland
license,
but
in
virginia
they
have
to
purchase
a
virginia
license
and
a
maryland
license
because
they
want
to
fish
up
in
the
creeks
of
the
river
entire
virginia
territory,
of
course
they
must
have
virginia
license
whereas
if
they
want
to
fish
within
the
river
proper
under
this
action
by
maryland
to
prevent
being
arrested
they
have
to
have
a
maryland
license.
we
feel
that
in
the
very
recent
case
of
west
virginia
ex
rel.
dyer
versus.
sims
which
did
not
come
up
on
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
but
which
was
the
case
which
original
jurisdiction
could
have
been
invoked,
this
court
said
in
an
agreement
solemnly
entered
into
between
states
by
those
who
alone
have
political
authority
to
speak
for
his
state
cannot
be
unilaterally
nullified
or
given
final
meaning
by
an
organ
of
one
of
the
contracting
states.
a
state
cannot
be
its
own
ultimate
judge
in
a
controversy
with
the
sister
state.
and
we
feel
that
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
be
its
own
judge
here
without
any
due
regard
for
the
rights
of
virginia.
now
the
maryland
contends
that
virginia
has
in
effect
already
nullified
part
of
the
contract,
because
if
we
say
that
chapter
sections
1
through
6,
9
and
12
are
no
longer
in
effect
because
they
have
been
superseded
by
the
constitution,
what
that
was,
was
a
mutual
amendment
of
the
compact
by
the
two
states.
each
state
ratified
the
constitution
and
when
each
state
ratified
the
constitution,
it
conveyed
to
and
delegated
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
the
powers
to
regulate
commerce
and
navigation
over
potomac
river
and
chesapeake
bay.
and
each
state
agreed
to
that.
and
we
have
cases
of
south
carolina
versus
georgia
where
the
court
held
in
the
similar
instances
when
the
states
mutually
ratified
the
constitution,
they
also
at
the
same
time
were
in
effect
amending
or
a
treaty
between
the
two
states
dealing
with
savannah
river.
the
offing
of
the
compact
by
the
mutual
action
of
the
two
states
in
ratifying
the
constitution
in
no
way
affected
the
rights
given
to
each
state
regarding
riparian
property
and
fisheries
which
is
left
as
it
was
before
the
constitution,
since
that
does
not
come
under
the
power
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
opinion
of
virginia
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
sufficient
justification
of
factual
evidence
to
justify
format
of
a
master.
now
maryland
has
raised
a
question
concerning
the
authority
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
grant
certain
sovereign
rights
in
potomac
and
they
cite
the
case
of
illinois
central
railroad
versus
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois.
now
that
is
possible
question,
but
we
don't
believe
that's
a
factual
question
it
is
more
of
a
legal
question
going
into
the
merits.
this
thing
about
maryland
is
set
out
in
its
opposition
factual
allegation
that
citizens
and
law
enforcement
officials
of
virginia
have
breached
the
compact
before
they
do
because
they
have
violated
certain
fishery
laws.
now
that
might
be
a
ground
for
the
possibility
of
a
master
taking
evidence,
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
fact
that
a
citizen
of
a
state
breaches
a
law
which
has
been
enacted
by
the
two
states
under
a
contract
makes
a
breach
of
the
contract.
we
can
show
we
have
arrested
in
the
past
few
years,
our
officials
have
arrested
more
than
a
100
citizens
of
virginia
for
violation
of
these
laws
and
that
this
year
we
have
extradited
on
request
of
maryland
four
citizens
of
virginia
who
have
been
charged
by
maryland
with
violating
the
concurrent
laws
in
the
river,
we
have
extradited
maryland
for
trial,
one
has
been
tried
and
has
been
convicted.
we
feel
that
virginia
does
have
a
direct
and
substantial
property
interest
in
these
proceedings
because
the
compact
vested
in
virginia
certain
proprietary
rights
in
the
southern
shores
of
potomac.
up
till
the
time
of
the
compact,
both
virginia
and
maryland
claimed
the
whole
potomac
river
and
then
virginia
gave
up
all
its
claims
except
to
the
southern
shore.
maryland
which
had
originally
claimed
to
the
high
watermark
gave
up
its
claim
except
to
low
watermark
on
the
virginia
shore.
so
there
are
these
shores,
which
are
proprietary
right
in
virginia
and
its
citizens
which
are
involved
in
this
proceeding.
they
are
riparian
rights
and
(inaudible)
guaranteed
to
the
property
owners
of
both
states
by
the
compact
which
are
put
in
doubt.
and
as
a
question
was
raised
concerning
these
riparian
and
property
rights
of
the
citizens
of
virginia
as
the
compact
is
allowed
to
be
abrogated.
this
court
in
decision
of
the
maryland
versus
west
virginia
held
that
not
the
award
of
1877
but
in
effect
the
compact
of
1785
fixed
the
boundary
between
virginia
and
maryland
fixed
--
and
also
fixed
the
boundary
between
west
virginia
maryland
and
west
virginia
broke
off
from
virginia.
it
had
also
fixed
the
boundary
between
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
because
a
compact
was
decided
and
agreed
upon
in
1785
and
maryland
didn't
cede
(inaudible)
to
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
federal
government
until
1789,
four
years
after
the
compact
and
that
the
boundary
had
already
been
fixed
on
the
lower
watermark
on
the
virginia
shore
four
years
before
this
territory
was
given
to
the
district
of
columbia
by
the
state
of
maryland.
and
this
decision
maryland
versus
west
virginia
has
not
been
questioned,
but
it
has
been
reiterated
by
at
least
two
lower
federal

both
which
hold
that
fishery
rights
of
property
rights
and
valuable
rights.
but
in
addition
to
that
to
any
property
rights
we
feel
that
an
absence
of
showing
a
property
right
that
virginia
has
a,
as
a
sovereign
state
a
right
to
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
in
this
case
because
of
the
quasi
sovereign
rights
which
it
passed
to
look
at
the
interest
of
its
people
as
outlined
in
the
already
mentioned
case
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
of
missouri
versus
illinois
and
by
two
cases
where
the
state
of
georgia
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper
company
206
us
230
and
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company
324
us
439.
in
the
first
case
we
have
an
industry
in
the
state
of
tennessee
which
was
causing
harm
to
property
in
the
state
of
georgia.
this
court
said
the
state
of
georgia
itself
had
titled
very
little
property,
but
it
had
the
right
and
the
duty
to
look
after
the
interest
of
its
citizens
whose
property
was
being
damaged
and
destroyed
by
this
noxious
gas
being
discharged
by
an
industry
in
another
state.
and
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
this
court
said
that
the
state
of
georgia
had
a
right
to
look
after
the
economy
of
the
state
and
the
right
of
its
citizens
to
not
being
discriminated
against
in
rate
fixing
by
the
railroad
and
at
the
state
has
parens
patriae,
had
a
right
to
come
into
this
court
and
that
that
right
long
had
been
recognized
by
this
court.
now
the
state
of
maryland
cites
a
washington
versus
smoot
sand
and
gravel
company
among
others
in
saying
that
there
is
no
property
right
in
virginia,
in
the
salt
of
the
bed
of
potomac
river.
well
we
agree
under
the
compact
that
the
virginia
gave
up
any
possible
claim
it
might
have
had
to
the
bed
of
the
potomac
river
in
return
for
free
use
of
the
river
and
in
return
for
property
owner,
undisputed
property
owner
on
the
southern
shores.
but
if
the
compact
is
allowed
to
be
aggregated,
then
there
comes
up
the
claim
as
to
whether
virginia
any
longer
has
free
use
of
the
river
and
whether
virginia
has
this
right
of
undisputed
property
interest
in
the
southern
shores
of
the
river.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
the
real
party
in
interest
in
these
proceedings,
state
of
maryland
contends
in
their
opposition
that
the
real
party
who
have
been
affected
is
not
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
but
some
800
fishermen
and
oysterman
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
that
virginia
is
merely
loaning
its
name
to
look
after
their
interests.
that
is
not
the
case,
the
sovereign
right
of
virginia
to
reuse
and
enjoyment
of
the
potomac
river
to
preserve
the
fish
in
the
potomac
river,
to
control
the
potomac
river,
to
have
equal
riparian
right
to
the
potomac
river,
all
these
are
cast
aside
by
this
action
and
invasion
by
the
state
of
maryland.
this
compact
was
a
contract
not
entered
into
by
some
800
fisherman,
but
rather
entered
into
by
the
state
of
virginia
in
a
sovereign
capacity,
a
sovereign
capacity
which
was
existing
before
the
constitution
was
ratified
and
also
by
the
state
of
maryland
in
its
sovereign
capacity.
in
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia,
262
us
553
this
court
said
that
a
complaint
state
could
come
in
to
redress
a
wrong
which
would
be
done
to
its
citizens
and
to
look
after
the
interest
of
its
citizens
at
large
by
a
sister
state
and
could
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction.
now
a
number
of
cases
cited
by
the
state
of
maryland
contending
it's
port
side
view
that
this
is
merely
action
on
behalf
of
certain
private
citizens
with
maryland
loaning
its
name.
these
cases
are
cases
which
a
state
attempted
to
collect
the
debt
owed
to
residents
of
its
state
by
a
sister
state
on
bond
cases,
--
the
oklahoma
bank
case,
oklahoma
ex
rel.
johnson
versus
cook,
304
us
387,
where
oklahoma
attempted
to
collect
from
a
stock
holder
in
a
bank
on
certain
stocks
for
the
benefit,
sole
benefit
of
creditors
and
depositors
of
the
bank,
the
state
wasn't
going
to
get
any
money
of
that
action,
and
in
these
bond
cases
the
state
wasn't
to
get
any
money
out
of
the
action.
and
the
case
was
south
dakota
versus
north
carolina
192
us
286
where
a
private
citizen
had
given,
made
an
outright
gift
of
bonds
to
the
state
which
that
citizen
has
gotten
from
north
carolina
was,
north
carolina
(inaudible)
the
state
said,
i
mean
this
court
the
state
of
south
dakota
could
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
to
collect
that
debt
even
though
it
was
just
a
few
thousand
dollars,
and
even
though
this
private
citizen
had
many
more
thousand
dollars
that
he
was
hoping
the
benefit
would
adhere
to
him,
by
this
court,
the
court
permitting
the
original
jurisdiction
to
be
invoked.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
your
honor
the
annual
revenue
is
--
cannot
be
broken
down
as
to,
as
to
license
you
get
from
the
potomac.
virginia
license
its
fishermen,
and
with
that
license
they
can
face
anywhere
in
the
title
by
this
water
of
virginia
including
the
potomac
river.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that
would
probably
be
approximately
40
or
$50,000.
just
taken
from
the,
from
the
potomac
river
alone
if
and
say
that
it's
just
levied
on,
they
are
just
coming
from
the
people
that
fish
in
potomac
and
nowhere
else,
it
would
run
somewhere
around
12
to
$15,000
a
year.
but
now
the
value
of
fish
taken
by
virginia
residents
and
docked
in
on
the
virginia
shores
amount
to
$3
million
or
$4
million
a
year.
and
strange
it
may
seem
although
all
you
hear
by
the
oyster
(inaudible)
actually
oysters
are
only
about
one-fourth
or
one-half
the
value
taken
by
virginia
citizens
as
compared
to
thin
fish,
trahira
and
shad
and
rock
and
fish
of
that
sort,
which
the
value
which
runs
a
million
and
half
dollars
a
year
of
those
taken
by
virginia
citizen
and
landed
in
virginia.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no
sir
we
feel
that
there
is
a
--
there
is
some
proprietary
interest
but
we
don't
feel
that
is
a
major
concern.
the
major
concern
is
that
the
sovereign
right
of
the
state
as
entered
into
this
contract.
we
feel
that
maryland
claims
that
no
vested
rights
of
virginia
have
been
invaded
by
this
action
of
there
is
in
enacting
these
two
statutes
we
disagree
with
that,
we
feel
that
there
have
been
a
vested
rights
or
right
of
agrarian
ownership
of
property,
the
rights
of
fishery
both
of
which
this
court
has
held
are
vested
rights
and
are
valuable
rights.
now
there
is
another
point
that
in
closing
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
minutes
before
a
short
rebuttal,
in
closing
there
is
one
point
that
has
not
been
discussed
by
either
virginia
or
maryland
in
their
bill
of
complaints
or
in
the
briefs
filed
and
that
is
if
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
not
invoked
what
remedy
does
virginia
have?
section
--
title
28,
section
1251
of
the
united
states
code
provides
in
part
as
follows,
“the
supreme
court
shall
have
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
controversies
between
two
or
more
states.”
therefore
we
cannot
go
into
a
lower
federal
court
because
congress
has
said
this
is
going
one
step
forward
in
the
constitution,
not
only
you
gentlemen
have
original
jurisdiction
but
you
also
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now
it
is
conceivable
how
virginia
could
establish
a
test
case
and
could
have
one
of
its
citizens
be
arrested
by
maryland
and
we
go
and
help
defend
and
fight
it
out
in
the
maryland
court,
but
as
this
court
have
said
in
kentucky
versus
indiana
and
west
virginia
ex
rel.
dyer
versus
sims,
that
when
there
is
a
controversy
between
two
states
a
decision
by
the
state
court
of
either
state
would
not
determine
the
controversy.
a
state
cannot
be
its
own
ultimate
judge
in
a
controversy
with
a
sister
state
to
determine
the
nature
and
scope
of
obligation
between
states,
whether
they
are
rise
through
the
legislative
means
of
compact
or
the
federal
law
of
governing
interstate
controversies
is
a
function
and
duty
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
nation.
your
honors
please
we
are
asking
the
court
today
to
invoke
this
original
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
or
to
decide
whether
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
compact
of
1785.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no
sir.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
that's
--
that
was
the
most
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
the
most
concrete
one
i
can
think
of
is
the
black-jenkins
award
of
1877
when
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
the
former
chief
justice
or
justice
of
the
court
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
and
that
was
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
the
two
states
have
met
from
time
to
time
to
confer
over
laws
but
not
i
mean
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
would,
i
don't
--
nowhere
i
can
say
that
the
negotiation
settlements,
there
have
been
negotiation
between
the
states
as
to
mutual
laws,
some
of
the
laws
to
pass
under
the
compact,
but
heretofore
your
honor,
we
have
one
thing
different.
heretofore
states
have
always
as
this
court
said
in
morton
versus
(inaudible)
both
states
have
always
recognized
a
binding
effect
of
the
compact.
now
maryland
comes
along
and
says
they
are
no
longer
recognized.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir
that
was,
that
was
the
condition
provided
in
the
compact
and
we
think
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
we
think
that
that
the
question
here,
which
is
really
question
of
international
law
and
question
of
treaties
between
two
sovereigns,
which
this
court
has
said
when
two
states
enter
into
compacts,
then
that
they
can
make
a
binding
contract
on
each
other
to
only
be
changed
by
the
mutual
concern
of
each
other
or
as
the
court
very
recently
said
in
west
virginia
ex
rel.
dyer
versus
sims
that
one
state
cannot
get
out
of
a
compact
with
sister
states
by
its
own
action
alone.
now
if
there
is
maybe
maryland
as
claimant
maybe
there
is
as
harshness
in
the
compact
that
maryland
would
bring
out,
that's
a
question
that
goes
to
the
merits
not
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
to
be
honest
with
your
honor
that
is
virginia's
position
now
maryland
disagrees
with
that
position,
but
we
feel
that
that
point
of
maryland
disagreement
that
position
is
a
matter
which
goes
to
the
merits
not
the
jurisdiction.
we
agree,
we,
our
position
is
this
contract
is
binding
in
that
they
can't
get
out
of
it,
so
to
speak
unless
we
agree
to
it
because
that's
the
way
it
was
passed
and
that's
the
way
it's
been
recognized
by
100%
in
two
years.
and
that
this
is
really
not
a
law
between
two
private
people
but
it's
a
treaty
between
two
nations
almost.
and
this
court
has
said
when
we
join
the
union
and
ratified
the
constitution
that
we
gave
up
certain
rights,
we
can't
negotiate
without
the
approval
of
congress,
we
can't
enforce
obligations
on
sister
state
by
force,
we
gave
up
that
right
of
use
by
a
force
and
in
turn
we
got
the
right
to
appeal
to
you
gentlemen
to
decide
any
questions
as
to
binding
effectiveness
of
a
contract
and
obligations
there
under.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
does
mr.
justice
brennan
because
one
of
the
valuable
things
to
property
boarding
a
body
of
water
is
riparian
rights.
now
there
is
a
question
how
much
riparian
rights,
does
virginian
have
in
territory
owned
maryland,
if
the
compact
did
not
exist?
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
riparian
rights
and
the
right
of
fisheries.
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
black-jenkins
award
is
a
binding
award
if
the
contract
did
not
exist,
because
in
black-jenkins
award,
they
said
that
the
award
was
made
under
the
provisions
of
the
compact
and
in
compliance
with
the
compact
and
full
agreement
with
the
validity
and
binding
effectiveness
of
the
compact,
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
the
compact
from
under
where
does
that
leave
the
black-jenkins
award?
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no
sir
they
are
lands
owned
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
united
states
of
america.
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
i
would
say
owns
approximately
6
to
7
miles
of
shore
land,
the
united
states
of
america
owns
much
more
because
of
us
marine
bases
at
quantico,
the
united
state
naval
proving
ground
at
dahlgren,
virginia.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
we
have
a
state
park
which
is
used
by
the
citizens
of
virginia.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
sir?
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
think
there
is
one
small
boat
pier
and
that's
all,
and
that's
land
of
4
or
5
miles
of
river
property
that
the
state
park
owns,
one
that
i
know
of
definitely
that
virginia
has
ownership
to.
i
think
there
are
probably
occasionally
smaller
lots,
but
there
are
no
major
walls
or
piers
by
virginia,
owned
by
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
in
the
potomac
river.
there
is
one
at
colonial
beach
own
by
the
municipality
of
colonial
beach,
one
other
than
the
gamut
of
piers
that
you
hear
so
much
of.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
well
to
be
honest
with
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
i
know
what
i
would
recommend
to
legislature
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
would
recommend
that
it
pass
statutes
that
says
that
declared
that
it
felt
that
citizens
had
equal
rights
in
the
river
and
that
they
did
not
have
to
purchase
license
from
maryland
and
that
the
full
weight
and
effect
of
the
state
of
virginia
was
put
behind
them
to
protect
them
from
any
harassment
or
(inaudible)
by
maryland
officials
so
long
as
they
comply
with
the
laws
of
virginia,
and
if
we
don't
have
a
controversy
now
then
i
don't
know
what
we
have
then.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
just
only
one
thing.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
no
sir,
i'm
not
suggesting
to
invite
the
military,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
virginia
should
take
steps
to
protect
its
citizens
from
harassment
by
maryland
officials
and
i
think
this
question
about
saying
virginia
and
maryland
can
negotiate,
we
have
negotiated
in
the
past,
but
in
the
past
we've
negotiated
with
the
understanding
by
both
states
that
the
compact
was
still
valid
obligation.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
yes
sir
from
time
to
time
and
an
illustration
of
one
thing
has
come
out
and
is
appeared
as
an
exhibit
in
the
bill
of
complaint
exhibit
f,
which
is
an
act
of
assembly
of
virginia
passed
in
1952
appointing
commissioners
for
the
two
rivers,
which
we
felt
is
a
sensible
approach
to
it,
but
maryland
has
not
seen
fit
to
enact
similar
legislation,
therefore
that's
on
our
books,
it
will
come
effective
any
time
under
our
theory
of
law
that
maryland
enacts
somewhat
similar
legislation

mr.
c.
f.
hicks
sir,
it's
in
the
--
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
that's
right
sir,
and
it's
an
invitation
to
setup
a
joint
commission
to
try
to
work
things
out
on
the
river.
but
maryland
instead
of
working
along
that
lines,
have
come
along
and
said
we're
just
refusing
the
whole
compact.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
think
that
if
we
entered
into
any
new
contract,
of
course
it
would
have
to
be,
our
compact
would
have
to
be
with
the
consent
of
congress.
i
don't
think
any
law
is
enacted,
pursuant
to
the
compact
between
the
two
states
would
have
to
go
through
congress,
because
the
compact
is
already
--
but
now
if
we
entered
into
any
new
compact
or
if
we
amended
and
repealed
or
repealed
and
amended
this
compact,
i
think
probably
congress
would
have
to
get
the
approval
–-
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
i
don't
think
so,
as
to
fishery,
because
the
fishery
hasn't
come
under
the
commerce
clause
as
to
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
individual
states.
mr.
c.
f.
hicks
any
further
question
your
honors?
