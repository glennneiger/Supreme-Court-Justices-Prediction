mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
with
the
court's
permission,
i
shall
like
to
point
out
some
very
pregnant
clause
in
the
enacting
clause
of
the
1785
act
of
the
maryland
legislature
and
the
same
wording
in
the
enacting
clause
of
the
virginia
legislature
and
enacting
the
compact
in
1785.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
at
page
26
of
the
bill
of
complaint
that
is
of
course
the
exhibit
being
the
compact
of
the
legislation
by
virginia,
approving
the
compact.
it
appears
as
to
maryland,
the
maryland
act
on
page
26
of
the
original
brief
and
as
to
the
virginia
act
on
page
33.
i
think
twice
your
honors
asked
mr.
kaufman
as
to
the
inviolability
of
the
wording
in
section
2
of
the
enacting
clause
--
the
act
enacting
the
compact
that,
and
i
mean
there
after
every
article
clause,
matter,
and
thing
in
the
same
compact
contain
shall
be
obligatory
on
this
state
and
the
citizens
thereof
and
shall
be
forever
faithfully
and
inviolably
observed
and
kept
to
this
government
and
all
its
citizens.
now
i
point
to
the
very
next
succeeding
phrase,
“according
to
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
such
compact.”
that
i
think
qualifies
the
perpetual
character
of
the
other
words
that
the
compact
will
continue
in
existence
as
long
it
is
executed
or
carried
out
according
to
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
such
compact.
of
course
maryland's
position
is
that
the
situation
has
changed.
that
actually
there
was
a
failure
of
consideration
moving
to
maryland
for
this
compact
four
years
after
the
compact
was
entered
into.
that
is
the
only
consideration
at
all
moving
to
maryland
under
this
compact
was
a
cessation
of
tolls
imposed
by
virginia,
duties
or
tolls
imposed
by
virginia
on
maryland
ships
coming
through
the
virginia
capes.
now
i
take
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
maybe
maryland
is
estopped
from
raising
that
point
up
to
recently
by
a
reason
of
the
black-jenkins
award,
the
apparent
or
the
recognition
of
a
compact
in
the
black-jenkins
award
and
by
attorney
general
poe,
but
our
position
that
the
failure
of
the
consideration
has
continued,
has
continued
the
consideration
moving
to
maryland,
has
actually
continued
down
to
this
day
because
of
the
actions
of
virginia,
the
flagrant
breach,
the
rescission,
the
breach
amounting
up
to
a
rescission
on
the
part
of
virginia
which
has
been
accepted
by
maryland
and
formalized
in
our
1957
acts.
now
it
is
also
significant
for
the
maryland
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
in
the
first
instance
of
course
the
--
a
party
to
a
contract
who
feels
a
compact,
the
contract
has
been
breached
has
a
determination,
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
in
his
opinion
the
compact
or
contract
has
been
breached
and
therefore
abrogated.
ultimately
the
arbitrator
of
that
of
course
(inaudible)
states
is
this
court.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
yes
sir,
yes
sir
but
we
say
that
the
record
itself
shows
that
it's
sufficient
in
the
record
that
it
show
that
this
court
should
not
entertain
this
case
at
this
time.
first
of
all
virginia,
the
state
has
not
been,
has
not
been
damaged.
actually
no
citizen
of
virginia
has
been
damaged.
we
feel
that
virginia
or
more
particularly
any
of
its
citizens
must
wait
until
they
have
been
damaged
by
any
action
of
maryland.
of
course
if
any
cases
arises,
which
maryland
is
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
contract
was
actually
rescinded
by
virginia
and
we,
maryland,
have
simply
formalized
the
action
recognized
it
by
the
passage
of
our
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
we
don't
concede
that
sir.
we
say
they
have
two
boats
on
a
river
that's
all
we
were
(inaudible)
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
if
fairly
sustainable,
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
not
completely
sir.
i
do
raise,
i
raise
another
point,
but
before
i
leave
it,
i
do
want
to
finish
with
page
26
of
the
original
pleading
and
refer
again
to
the
cause,
just
before
section
2
begins
in
the
maryland
statute
approving
the
compact
and
i
point
out
that
that
clause
does
not
appear
in
virginia.
but
certainly
the
idea
behind
this
clause
permeates
the
whole
reason
for
and
a
manner
in
which
the
compact
should
have
been
carried
out.
that
is
good
faith
and
if
executed
meaning
carried
out
not
merely
signed
but
carried
out,
executed
with
good
faith
will
perpetuate
harmony,
friendship
and
good
offices
between
two
states.
now
that
of
course
is
a
whole
point
of
this
controversy
between
maryland
and
virginia.
the
facts
are
that
and
i
think
it
can
be
shown
that
virginia
has
considered
this
compact
at
least
since
the
adoption
of
a
federal
constitution
as
a
matter
of
all
take
by
virginia
and
all
put
by
maryland.
it
has
not
been
carried
out
in
good
faith
by
virginia
mounting
up
over
the
years
to
a
rescission
by
virginia
which
we
have
merely
formalized.
now
before
my
time
has
expired
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
technical
reason
why
this
particular
suit
should
not
be
entertained
in
this
court
at
this
time
and
that
technical
reason
is
that
even
if
the
compact
is
considered
to
be
subsisting,
either
state
has
the
right
to
offer
legislation
for
concurrence
by
the
other
state.
in
effect,
if
under
that
bill
that
the
compact
is
still
in
existence,
still
subsists,
this
legislation
can
only
be
considered
as
an
offer
to
virginia,
as
an
offer
to
virginia
even
considering
the
compact
as
an
effect,
which
maryland
denies
as
an
offer
or
proper
to
virginia
of
repealing
legislation
and
conservation
legislation.
all
we
know
as
yet
virginia
might
agree
to
it.
virginia
legislature
has
not
met
since
the
maryland
legislature
passed
this
legislation.
so
technically
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
which
legislation?
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
oh
no,
no
this
does
not,
but
that
is
not
a
condition
precedent
for
enactment
of
law
or
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
oh
yes
maryland
does
sir,
that's
maryland's
position.
but
conceivably
--
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
i
say
if
the
compact
were
considered
still
demand
existence
it
could,
this
legislation
could
be
considered
as
a
proper
to
virginia.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
my
point
is
that
the
maryland
--
the
virginia
legislature
has
not
met
since
its
legislation
was
passed
by
virginia,
the
maryland,
the
virginia
legislature
is
the
only
body
in
virginia
which
can
declare
the
public
policy
of
that
state
and
that
only
agency
has
not
had
a
chance
to
make
a
stand
on
this
legislation
of
maryland.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
i
don't
say
we
are
waiting,
we
are
not
waiting,
but
i
say
that
we
don't
know
yet
whether
virginia
--
the
only
body
in
virginia,
agency
in
virginia
which
can
enunciate
public
policy,
it
may
conceivably
i
doubt
it,
it
may
except
it.
but
i
say
right
now
this
case
is
pretty
mature.
likewise
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
does
not
make
any
showing
in
his
brief
or
here
that
he
has
been
authorized
by
the
legislature
to
file
suit
on
behalf
of
virginia,
file
this
suit
and
certainly
the
virginia
legislature
is
the
only
body
which
can,
we
think,
authorize
such
action.
it
is
the
only
agency
which
can
enunciate
virginia's
policy.
mr.
c.
ferdinand
sybert
well
that
--
that
maryland's
constitution
has
held
us
to
depend
the
state
whenever
it
is
sued,
[attempt
to
laughter],
thank
you
sir.
