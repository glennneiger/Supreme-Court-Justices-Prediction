mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors
please.
i
was
surprised
to
hear
my
brother
speak
of
riparian
rights
since
their
bill
of
complaint
is
only
based
upon
fishing
rights.
the
only
allegations
in
the
bill
of
complaint
which
they
seek
to
file
is
a
denial
of
fishing
rights
and
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that,
that
would
be
an
issue
here,
although
we're
prepared
to
meet
that.
now
if
your
honors
please,
my
brother
has
glossed
over
the
facts
in
background
of
this
thing
somewhat,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
go
into
the
background
of
this
case
to
see
exactly
what
we
have
here
and
why
we
have
it.
now
prior
to
1785,
we
were
then
under
the
articles
of
confederation.
the
constitution
had
not
been
dreamed
of.
in
fact
this
court
had
not
--
the
thought
of
this
court
and
had
even
been
conceived.
now
under
the
tangled
relationship
between
the
states
that
existed
in
1785,
there
was
no
central
authority,
each
state
was
an
independent
sovereign
nation
only
bound
together
for
a
common
offense.
with
that
in
view
and
with
an
unsettled
boundary
question
that
existed
back
to
the
1600's,
maryland
and
virginia
had
two
major
controversies
between
them.
first
there
was
a
conflict
as
to
jurisdiction
over
the
potomac,
the
pocomoke
rivers
and
parts
of
the
chesapeake
bay.
secondly
there
was
a
dispute
over
collection
of
tolls
by
virginia
on
vessels
passing
through
the
virginia
capes
to
baltimore,
maryland's
major
port
and
also
a
controversy
on
the
collection
of
tolls
by
maryland
on
vessels
coming
up
the
potomac
river
to
alexandria
which
was
an
important
port
at
that
time
on
the
potomac
river.
now
prior
to
1785,
which
would
indicate
that
the
boundary
issue
was
not
important
at
that
time,
virginia,
by
the
adoption
of
its
first
constitution
in
1776,
surrendered
all
claims
it
had
to
territories
claimed
by
other
states
contained
within
her
charter
with
the
exception
of
the
free
navigation
and
use
of
the
rivers
potomac
and
pocomoke.
now
virginia
in
1776
disclaimed
any
title
to
the
potomac
river.
its
some
nine
years
before
the
compact
was
conceived
and
at
that
time
the
compact
did
not
deal
with
the
boundary
dispute.
it
dealt
with
jurisdictional
disputes,
because
we
had
no
central
government
and
because
we
had
two
independent
nations
at
that
time.
now,
virginia
originally
made
this
call
for
the
compact
sir,
and
they,
according
to
their
own
call,
wished
to
adjust
and
confirm
the
rights
of
each
to
use,
to
the
use
of
navigation
and
jurisdiction
over
these
two
rivers.
based
upon
this
premise
a
meeting
was
called
in
1777
at
the
request
of
virginia.
it's
unimportant
why
this
meeting
was
unsuccessful,
but
be
it
known
that
it
was
unsuccessful
and
nothing
came
out
of
the
1777
meeting.
now
maryland's
consideration
for
the
compact
was
to
have
virginia
relinquish
every
claim
to
impose
tolls
on
any
vessels
sailing
through
the
virginia
capes
to
maryland
and
this
was
a
condition
and
the
instructions
to
the
maryland
delegates
sine
qua
non.
if
there
was
any
reason
that
this
could
not
be
gotten,
marylanders
would
have
come
home
without
any
compact.
now
what
was
the
call
as
to
fishing
rights?
there
was
no
mention
whatsoever
in
the
call,
or
no
mention
in
the
original
negotiations.
after
we
had
that
situation,
a
conference
was
held
at
george
washington's
home
at
mount
vernon
in
march
of
1785
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that,
that
was
some
ten
months
prior
to
the
action
of
the
virginia
general
assembly,
which
started
the
ball
rolling
for
a
constitution.
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
asked
for
a
call
of
delegates
for
the
adoption
of
a
constitution,
this
was
some
ten
months
before
that.
now
what
does
the
compact
provide?
what
are
the
major
provisions
of
the
compact?
what
was
the
intention
of
the
drafters
of
the
compact?
my
brother
has
included
that
as
exhibits
in
his
--
attached
to
his
bill
of
compliant
and
articles
i
through
vi
which
are
the
prime
articles
of
this
compact
deal
with
navigation
of
these
rivers.
they
further
deal
with
the
vessels
of
war
of
both
states
which
recognize
at
that
time
that
each
state
had
the
power
to
make
war
and
had
the
power
to
have
vessels
of
war
and
it
made
the
potomac
river
a
common
highway
for
the
purposes
of
navigation.
article
vii
ensured
to
citizens
of
both
states
full
property
rights
which
then
existed
in
each
state.
it
didn't
grant
anything
new.
it
kept
the
status
quo
as
to
property
rights
and
also
kept
the
status
quo
as
to
fishing
rights,
which
they
had
both
enjoyed
in
the
past.
it
wasn't
a
grant,
it
was
ensuring
of
the
present
situation.
article
viii
required
that
all
laws
and
regulations
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
fish
shall
be
made
with
the
mutual
consent
and
approbation
of
both
states.
article
ix
dealt
with
the
erection
and
maintenance
of
lighthouse
and
buoys
which
are
since
been
superseded
by
the
commerce
clause.
article
x
dealt
with
the
jurisdiction
of
piracies,
crimes
and
offenses
on
places
where
the
boundary
was
doubtful,
on
places
where
the
boundary
was
doubtful
only,
which
also
gave
an
intention
to
the
--
that
it
was
a
question
of
jurisdiction
this
compact
was
interested
in.
now
my
brother
has
made
reference
to
a
recent
case
of
barnes
versus
maryland
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
dealt
with
a
criminal
case
on
the
river
in
which
held
that
since
the
black-jenkins
award
of
1877
there
was
no
longer
any
doubtful
portions
of
the
river
as
to
jurisdiction
and
therefore
the
river
within
maryland,
maryland
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
to
crimes
and
that
part
which
would
be
virginia,
below
the
low
water
mark,
virginia
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
this
court
denied
certiorari
of
that
case.
that
case
didn't
recognize
anything
as
to
the
validity
or
current
existence
of
the
compact.
the
defense
that
maryland
had
no
jurisdiction
because
of
this
section
10
was
overridden
by
the
fact
that
our
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
10
had
no
more
meaning
because
there
was
no
longer
any
doubtful
territory.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor
we
had
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no
sir
that
is
one
of
the
arguments.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
like
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute,
i
have
that
in
my
mind.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
now
if
your
honors
please
the
other
article
cited
by
my
brother
article
xi
provided
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
process,
xii
provided
for
transportation
of
produce
between
the
states.
those
have
all
been
superseded.
now
in
the
ratification
i
think
it's
very
important
if
your
honors
will
take
a
look
at
page
26
of
the
bill
of
complaints
sought
to
be
filed
by
the
state
of
virginia.
the
ratification
by
the
state
of
maryland
had
certain
conditions
to
it
and
i
think
these
conditions
are
important
and
the
purposes
of
it
and
it
says
and
i
am
reading
in
the
middle
of
page
26.
“and
whereas
this
general
assembly
--
”
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
of
the
proposed
bill
of
complaint
sir,
“and
whereas
this
general
assembly
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
said
compact
is
made
on
just
and
mutual
principles
for
the
true
interest
of
both
governments
and
if
executed
in
good
faith
will
perpetuate
harmony,
friendship
and
good
offices
between
the
two
states
so
essential
to
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
their
people.”
we
think
that
is
very
important
because
that
is
again
a
legislative
contention
that
this
shall
only
exist
as
long
as
there
is
good
faith.
we
think
that
there
hasn't
been
good
faith.
now
on
the
intervening
years
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct
sir.
now
in
the
intervening
years
we
had
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
we
had
the
arbitration
award
of
1877
which
my
brother
has
referred
too.
we
have
had
several
cases
which
immutably
set
the
boundary
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
the
south
or
low
watermark
of
the
virginia
shore.
now
maryland
undisputedly
has
title
to
the
river
and
as
title
owner
to
the
river
has
title
to
all
fish
including
thin
fish
and
shell
fish
and
it
is
our
contention
with
title
in
the
state
of
maryland,
it
is
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
to
protect
and
conserve
those
assets
for
its
citizens
and
for
others
who
might
have
the
title.
now
what
is
the
current
situation
there
sirs?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please
it
goes
to
the
question
as
i
see
it
whether,
one
as
just
mr.
justice
black
said,
whether
a
contract
must
exist
in
perpetuity
when
there
is
a
change
of
circumstances,
where
there
is
a
lack
of
good
faith
then
i
think
the
honor
that
the
state
of
maryland
gave
--
they
have
a
right
to
look
at
those
circumstances
as
they
then
exist
and
to
take
such
action
as
it
might
be
necessary
to
protect
its
assets,
in
this
case
the
property
on
the
potomac
river.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
if
--
if
your
honors
agree
to
hear
this
case
that
will
be
a
prime
issue
we
feel,
yes
sir.
we
feel
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
this
court
takes
jurisdictions
as
i
say,
and
listens
to
this
case
that
will
be
one
of
our
prime
defenses.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
don't
understand.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
may
i
rephrase
your
question
as
i
understand
it
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
is
this
a
case
or
controversy
then
within
the
meaning
of
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
i
think
your
honor
i
can
answer
this
by
the
that
maryland
has
the
right
to
make
that
initial
determination,
any
party
to
a
contract
has
the
right
to
determine
if
a
breach
has
been
made
by
the
other
party
and
to
take
its
remedies.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
absolutely
true,
that
has
happened
many
times
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor
i
think
that
this
is
not
the
proper
court
for
this
reason.
my
brothers
rely
on
section
7
and
8
of
the
compact.
now
section
7
and
8
do
not
grant
anything
to
the
state
of
virginia
or
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
it
grants
it
to
the
citizens.
now
the
citizens
are
the
people
who
have
the
right,
if
they
have
any
interest
to
be
protected.
the
commonwealth
has
no
proprietary
interest.
they
have
alleged
none
in
their
bill
of
compliant.
they
have
only
alleged
a
vague
right
they
say
that
they
have.
they
don't
say
what
that
right
is,
where
they
derive
it,
but
the
citizens
of
virginia
have
the
right
of
fishing
in
the
river.
the
commonwealth
doesn't
say
that
it
is
engaged
in
a
fishing
business.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honors
please
i
think
my
brother
in
his
brief
has
raised
the
point
of
the
case
of
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia
and
this
court
very
clearly
laid
down
that
the
reason
this
court
took
jurisdiction
was
the
fact
that
the
state
had
a
proprietary
interest
in
seeing
the
natural
gas
flowed
from
west
virginia
into
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
ohio
to
heat
the
schools
and
other
governmental
institutions.
and
secondly
said
and
i
think
this
is
very
important
that
we
will
--
they
have
a
right
to
protect
their
citizens
because
they
infect
the
citizens
of
the
entire
state.
and
the
court
made
a
very
important
point
of
that,
that
it
wasn't
an
isolated
section
of
the
state
or
a
small
portion
of
the
state
they
were
protecting,
but
they
were
protecting
substantial
part
or
the
entire
state.
now
let's
look
at
what
virginia
claimed
here.
we
have
four
or
five
counties
in
the
northern
neck
of
virginia,
virginia
is
approximately
a
100
counties
affected.
we
have
a
claim
of
some
800
citizens,
i
don't
know
the
population
of
virginia
but
i
am
assured
that
that
is
not
a
substantial
portion.
they
came
to
this
court
and
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
on
behalf
of
some
200
virginia
oystermen.
those
are
the
real
parties
in
interest
if
your
honors
please,
the
persons
who
they
say
are
defeated,
the
commonwealth
sets
up
no
right
in
its
own
name.
the
commonwealth
isn't
adversely
affected
by
the
action
of
maryland
nor
the
citizens
frankly
because
they
still
are
out
on
that
river
today
fishing
and
oystering
and
they
will
continue
under
the
acts
of
maryland.
the
acts
of
maryland
were
to
discriminate
against
virginians.
the
situation
arose
because
there
was
no
law
on
the
river,
because
there
was
chaos
because
two
states
had
different
laws
on
the
river
and
i
think
that's
where
i
like
to
get
into,
and
if
your
honors
would
understand
that,
you
will
see
why
maryland's
action
was
absolutely
necessary
and
the
only
course
it
had
before
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
your
honor
[attempt
to
laughter]
it's
hard
to
distinguish
with
the
questions
whether
we
are
on
the
merits
or
whether
we
are
talking
in
generalities,
but
i
think
this
is
important
in
order
that
you
get
the
background
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it's
minute.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
it's
an
insubstantial
amount.
we
have
200
oystermen
i
don't
know
how
many
citizens
there
are
in
virginia,
but
i
am
sure
there
are
many
million.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
don't
know
the
current
figure
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
any
person
who
is
engaged
in
tonguing
for
oyster
or
for
fish
that's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
you
would
have
to
get
a
license.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
we
make
no
distinction
between
those
engaged
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
that's
a
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
what
they
allege
sir.
that's
their
bill
of
complaint.
i
assure
you
if
there
were
more
people
in
concern
that
the
commonwealth
would
allege
that.
now
if
your
honors
would
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
not,
in
its
original
conception
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
impliedly
yes
sir
because
congress
approved
the
black-jenkins
award.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no
express
ratification
has
come.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honors
please
very
same
way
that
a
virginian
now
being
tried
in
the
maryland
courts.
he
will
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
triumph.
he
will
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
of
maryland
to
regulate
it,
claiming
his
rights
under
the
compact.
that's
the
way
most
of
these
cases
come
to
this
court.
the
cases
my
brothers
relied
on
have
come
to
this
court.
green
versus
fiddle
came
to
this
court
that
way.
fletcher
versus
peck
came
to
this
--
back
to
this
court
that
way,
west
virginia
versus
sims
came
to
this
court
that
way.
that's
the
proper
method
to
get
it
adjudicated.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
feel
that
over
a
period
of
time
somewhat
before,
and
i
would
like
to
go
into
those
facts
as
to
why
we
think
that
virginia
by
her
own
action
has
really
breached
this
compact,
if
i
may
do
that,
it
is
not
on
the
question
here
today,
but
i
think
it's
important.
back
in
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
all
right
sir.
back
in
1928
the
united
states
bureau
of
fisheries
made
a
survey
of
oysters
in
the
potomac
river
and
at
that
time
they
found
the
river,
i
think
the
word
they
used
was
denuded
of
oysters.
that
brought
some
very
quick
action
by
maryland
and
virginia,
in
1930
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
said
that
dredging
operations
for
oysters
which
had
previously
have
been
legal
are
now
illegal
and
maryland
adopted
the
same
statute
1931
at
its
session
of
legislature.
both
states
at
that
point
realized
the
necessity
for
conservation
and
as
a
result
the
oysters
bars
of
the
potomac
river
have
been
replenished
and
there
are
now
oysters
in
the
river.
now
during
the
war,
there
was
a
great
need
for
seafood,
prices
for
seafood
rose
substantially
and
the
bars
were
very
well
recovered.
they
were
good
supply
and
what
happened,
we
have
what
we
known
in
ground
as
the
virginia
scrapping
fleet
was
inaugurated
which
was
about
50
or
60
high
speed
boats
which
were
engaged
in
illegal
dredging.
and
during
the
war
years
because
of
the
exigencies
of
the
time
enforcement
was
unfortunately
quite
poor.
now
the
survey
made
by
the
maryland
department
of
tide
water
fisheries
shows
at
that
time,
that
over
five
(inaudible)
of
all
oysters
taken
from
the
river
were
illegally
taken.
now
maryland
after
the
war
started
to
get
hot
about
this.
they
started
to
take
some
action.
they
had
men
and
materials
back
to
do
it.
and
the
virginian
authorities
unfortunately
took
no
action
to
halt
this
illegal
dredging.
and
unfortunately
the
overwhelming
sentiment
in
virginia
was
against
the
state's
anti
dredging
law
and
what
happened
as
a
result
of
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
sir?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
or
by
citizen.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
virginia
doesn't
engage
in
fishing
business.
now
what
happened
in
1946?
virginia
by
chapter
235
of
its
laws
makes
it
permissible
to
dredge
in
the
potomac
river.
it
cited
the
legislative
policy
of
virginia
as
the
public
policy
of
virginia
that
dredging
is
legal.
it
is
still
recognizes
the
compact,
but
the
legislative
policy
is
there
set
forth,
the
dredging
of
oysters
in
the
river
is
legal.
and
once
you
have
that
legislative
sanction,
you
have
chaos
because
maryland's
legislative
policy
is
opposed
to
dredging
and
virginia's
legislative
policy
is
in
favor
of
dredging
and
there
is
where
the
trouble
started.
illegal
operations
were
encouraged
in
virginia
because
virginians,
all
they
had
to
do
when
they
go
before
a
jury
in
virginia,
if
they
are
ever
picked
up
for
dredging,
well
the
legislature
said
it
is
perfectly
all
right.
there
--
we
are
bound
to
the
legislature
of
virginia,
not
the
legislature
of
maryland
and
conviction
are
--
were
impossible
everything
about
the
whole
--
there
was
chaos
as
a
result
of
it.
there
was
confusion
in
law
enforcement.
there
were
shootings,
unfortunate
injuries
to
the
law
enforcement
officers,
and
there
was
other
chaos
on
the
river.
now
we
there
contend
that
there
is
where
the
good
faith,
the
virginia
shore
of
maryland
ceased
because
we
had
no
law
in
the
river,
we
had
shooting
of
maryland
law
enforcement
officers
what
is
the
result
had
to
happen,
the
state
of
maryland
is
now
from
the
united
states
navy
under
a
lease
arrangement
had
to
get
pt
boats
to
halt
this.
that's
how
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
back
in
1931,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
purported
to
repeal
it
if
maryland
ever
repealed
its
anti-
dredging
legislation
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
could
not,
that's
correct.
but
maryland
was
--
we
didn't
have
two
laws
on
the
river
in
effect,
and
it
just
was
an
impossible
situation.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honor
please,
even
in
brother's
bill
of
complaint
on
page
55,
you'll
see
section
28-242,
which
sets
up
the
dredging
situation.
it's
codified
as
part
of
the
code
of
virginia.
virginians
recognize
it.
they
always
make
this
defense
in
every
case
that
are
tried
under
virginia,
that
the
legislature
has
sanctioned
dredging
and
we
have
chaos.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor
they
are
not
in
the
papers
in
the
case
at
this
stage.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
but
this
act
is
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
they
are
not,
they'll
have
an
opportunity
to
deny,
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
the
act
itself
in
the
bill
of
complaint
sir.
the
reasons
for
the
act
i'm
giving
you
and
a
result
of
the
act
i'm
giving
you.
we
haven't
--
we
can
go
to
the
affidavits
that
were
given
on
motion
for
opposition
to
the
issuance
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
we
set
forth
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor
i
went
into
this
question
because
it
was
asked
me
when
did
we
think
that
the
virginia
has
itself
breached
the
compact?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
well
i'm
trying
to
show
you
how
it
evaporated
then
sir.
that's
my
point.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes
sir,
we
feel
that
between
--
in
this
post
war
era.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
maryland
only
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
repudiate
it,
formalize
it
and
repudiate
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
we
think
that
it's
been
repudiated,
and
all
that
maryland
did
was
formalize
the
showing
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
virginia
had
no
reason
to,
it's
one
way
street
to
virginia,
virginia
gives
up
nothing
and
get
everything
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
one
party
breaches
a
contract,
the
other
party
has
certain
remedies.
one
of
those
remedies
is
rescission.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
and
that
is
what
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
what
the
legislature
of
maryland
found
in
the
preamble
to
its
own
act.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
cites
that,
that's
on
page
--
starting
at
page
71
of
the
bill
of
complaint,
the
preamble
sets
all
that
forth
why
the
maryland
legislature
had
to
take
this
action
because
of
these
breaches.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
because
it's
not
a
case
for
this
court
on
it's
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
precisely
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
said
without
waiving
its
right
to
file
an
appropriate
answer.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
and
as
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
you
are
right
sir
and
i
was
only
trying
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
all
right
sir.
well
i'll
get
back
to
the
argument
in
chief
sir
if
i
may?
we
contend
that
this
court
should
look
behind
the
official
title
in
this
case
and
see
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
we
think
that
there
is
sufficient
statements
of
this
court.
in
the
recent
case
of
arkansas
versus
texas,
this
court
said
it
would
look
behind
the
title
of
the
case
to
see
who
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
now
virginia
in
its
own
right
claims
no
irreparable
injury
to
any
of
her
public
institutions,
any
of
her
governmental
agencies.
she
contends
only
that
there
is
a
potential
invasion
to
her
citizens,
because
maryland
sometime
in
the
future
might
deprive
her
citizens
of
fishing
on
the
potomac
river.
now,
as
i
have
said
earlier,
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
limited
number
of
citizens
of
virginia
and
i
don't
think
it's
parens
patriae
that
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
can
exercise
that
right
for
such
a
limited
number.
now,
the
question
i
brought
there
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
the
georgia
tennessee
case
the
entire
air
over
a
substantial
portion
of
the
georgia
is
polluted
sir
with
noxious
gases.
it
was
a
protection
of
the
air
rights
over
the
state
which
no
individual
claimed
the
air
rights.
it
wasn't
an
individual's
claim
as
to
the
noxious
fumes
in
the
air.
it
was
the
state's
rights.
it
was
the
state's
property
in
the
air.
it
wasn't
individuals
who
were
affected.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
each
individual
probably
could
have
sir.
here
is
what
this
court
i
think
said,
and
i
think
this
sums
up
our
position
very
quickly
on
this
point.
in
order
then
to
maintain
jurisdiction
of
this
bill
of
complaint
as
against
the
state
of
texas,
i'm
quoting
from
louisiana
versus
texas,
it
must
appear
that
the
controversy
to
be
determined
is
a
controversy
arising
directly
between
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
texas,
and
not
a
controversy
in
vindication
of
the
grievances
of
particular
individuals.
now
if
your
honors
please,
we
claim
that
there
are
particular
individuals
who
we
feel
seek
refuge
behind
the
cloak
of
the
compact
to
carry
on
illegal
dredging
and
that's
the
reason
we're
here
today.
we
think
it's
clear
on
the
face
of
it,
that
the
state
of
virginia
makes
this
claim
as
in
paragraph
13
--
i
think
it's
12
and
13
on
behalf
of
these
citizens.
it
doesn't
mention
on
its
own
behalf.
paragraph
12
sets
forth
the
total
number
of
virginians
and
paragraph
13
cites
the
untold
hardship
on
approximately
200
citizens
of
virginia
who
annually
engage
in
tonguing
for
oysters
as
a
means
of
a
livelihood.
that's
the
basis
of
this
bill
of
complaint.
now
there
is
one
other
thing
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
if
i
may
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
sir,
as
a
practical
matter
virginia
never
would
because
it's
getting
something
for
nothing.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
she
did
take
the
action?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
would
be
perfectly
happy.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
not
sir.
they
are
a
sovereign
state,
just
as
maryland
is
a
sovereign
state.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honor
please,
the
contract
in
1785
undoubtedly
had
some
legal
validity,
but
what
is
the
legal
validity
in
1957,
we
contend
there
is
none
anymore.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
by
change
of
circumstances,
by
the
lack
of
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
just
formalize,
what
we
had
already
thought
existed.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
specifically
enforce
the
rights
that
are
alleged
to
be
violated
here
by
the
state
of
virginia.
the
state
of
virginia
alleges
that
we
haven't
gotten
confirmed
legislation
with
them
on
this
repeal
and
therefore
they're
entitled
to
some
relief,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
a
specific
force,
because
there
again
it's
a
political
question.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
legislatures
of
both
states
as
a
political
matter
decide
what
the
legislative
policy
of
the
state
is.
i
hope
i've
answered
your
question
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
that
virginia
would
have
any
jurisdiction
that
do
so,
it's
not
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction,
virginia
is
solely
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
maryland.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
the
chief
justice
asked
me
a
hypothetical
question
which
we
still
take
a
same
position
if
virginia
had
done
what
maryland
had
done.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no
sir
that's
not
what
happened,
whether
they
have
repealed
the
compact,
whether
they
formalized
the
repeal
of
the
compact
sir.
now
we
wish
your
honors
also
to
look
at
the
prayers
for
relief
of
the
bill
of
complaint,
and
see
if
they
present,
what
we
consider
to
be
a
judiciable
case
or
controversy
within
this
court.
their
prime
bill
of
complaint,
prime
prayer
for
relief
in
the
bill
of
complaint
asked
that
the
compact
of
1785
between
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
and
the
state
of
maryland
be
adjudicated
and
decreed
in
accordance
with
those
terms
forever
binding,
forever
binding.
now
i
have
known
of
no
court,
nor
i
can't
find
no
authority
for
any
court
to
forever
bind
a
sovereign
state.
that's
asking
for
something
so
far
in
the
future
that
we
don't
know
what'll
ever
happen
in
future.
the
potomac
river
might
dry
up
in
the
future,
we
don't
know
that
forever
binding.
that's
an
abstract
question
or
a
speculative
question
that
if
i've
read
one.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
you've
got
to
i
think
read
that
in
light
of
its
purpose
of
the
conditional
purpose
of
ratification,
that
it
will
be
executed
in
good
faith
and
will
perpetuate
harmony
and
friendship
and
good
offices.
now
if
it
doesn't
meet
that
condition,
of
course
its
--
no
contract
will
be
kept
if
the
provisions
under
the
contract
aren't
kept,
even
if
it
says
contracts
for
ten
years
and
there
is
a
breach
in
the
first
year,
that
doesn't
mean
that
contract
will
last
for
that
ten
years.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please,
then
there
would
never
be
any
decision
as
to
when
a
compact
would
be
breached,
other
than
by
coming
to
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
article?
oh.
but
the
point
we
make
here
sir
is
this.
who
is
to
make
that
determination
in
the
first
instance?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
feel
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
might
eventually
have
to
be
determined
by
a
court.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
who
does
the
provisions
run
in
favor
of
sir?
it
doesn't
run
in
favor
of
the
state,
it
runs
in
favor
of
the
people
who
fish,
the
citizens.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honor
please
i
say
this,
that
states
do
not
act
as
individuals,
they
are
not
capable
of
action
except
through
their
citizens
and
except
through
their
legally
constituted
representatives,
and
we
feel
that
through
the
action
of
the
virginians,
both
its
citizens
and
as
sanctioned
by
its
legislature,
they
have
created
chaos
on
the
river.
they
have
not
kept
up
the
good
faith
that
was
required
and
that
is
why
we
have
no
law
on
the
river
now.
my
brother
has
come
in
here
and
asking
to
put
you
back
and
put
us
back
on
a
status
quo,
where
again
there
would
be
no
law
on
the
river,
where
they
would
be
shooting.
now
at
least
we
have
law
on
the
river
and
no
virginian
has
been
deprived
of
one
right
that
he
has
under
the
compact.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
--
they
are
the
real
parties
in
interest,
yes
sir.
and
we
say
that
and
our
attorney
general
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
intention
of
the
legislature
of
maryland
is
carried
out
by
the
fact
that
they
do
want
to
give
virginians
the
right
to
fish
and
earn
a
livelihood.
we're
not
trying
to
deprive
virginias
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes
sir
they
can
change
tomorrow
and
if
there
is
a
compact
they
could
under
virginia's
own
theory,
they
could
change
with
mutual
consent.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
what
the
point
make
sir
is,
there
is
nothing
on
the
river,
prior
to
june
1st
there
was
lawlessness,
that
was
no
law
on
the
river.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honor
would
refer
to
our
answer
to
the
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order
and
affidavits,
the
affidavits
cite
that
very
clearly,
it's
in
the
record
of
this
case.
i
refer
you
to
the
affidavits
of
john
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct.
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
demur.
mr.
general
sybert
would
like
to
conclude
on
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
may
it
please
the
court.
maryland
has
concluded
its
argument
unless
there
are
some
further
questions
by
the
court.
