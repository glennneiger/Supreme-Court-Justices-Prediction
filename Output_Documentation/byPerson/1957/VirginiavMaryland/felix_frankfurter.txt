justice
felix
frankfurter
but
intermittently,
intermittently
you
have
settled
it
peacefully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
say
that
each
state
has
the
right
to
be
part
of
the
commissioners
of
each
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
edmund
randolph?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
who
else
james
madison
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
george
mason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
compact
have
any
provision
dealing
with
its
termination,
abrogation,
qualification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
is
it--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
compact
printed
in
its
entirety?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
yours,
mr.
hicks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
concede
to
be
a
virginia
--
virginia
concedes
to
be
issues
before
us
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
i
want
to
agree
with
you,
so
that
necessarily
followed,
suppose
i
agree
with
you,
(inaudible)
conclude
that
this
bill
is
properly
filed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
every
breach
an
agreement,
every
breach
of
a
compact
legally
is
centered
upon
necessarily
gives
rise
to
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
an
ordinary
court
of
equity
always
enforce
a
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
leave
alone
the
contract
between
the
states,
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
so,
but
i
just
want
to
probe
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
we
must
at
once
go
to
what
do
you
have
denominated
constitutional
question,
the
same
with
first
construction,
is
this
a
compact,
is
it
a
contract,
constitutionally
protected
and
you
say
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
then
inevitably
relief
must
follow
on
this
sale
and
if
the
bill
must
be
entertained
and
relief
must
follow,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
do
not
address
yourself,
as
i
understand,
to
the
question,
whether
the
nature
of
the
claim
made
by
virginia,
the
impact,
the
magnitudes,
the
range
of
the
alleged
damages,
the
alleged
--
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
briefs,
and
the
scope
of
the
damages
flowing
there
from
are
of
such
a
nature
that
this
court
must
take
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
as
i
understand
that
i
think
your
answer,
that
if
there
is
a
contract,
an
existing
contract,
a
unilaterally
non-repealable
contract
through
the
compact
and
there
is
a
breach
that
this
court
must
exercise
its
jurisdiction,
not
that
it
doesn't
have
it,
but
it
must
exercise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
those
cases
very
different
mr.
hick?
this
court
said
again
and
again
that
the
nature
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
in
hailing
another
state
before
it
(inaudible)
not
a
mechanical
jurisdiction,
but
involves
consideration
that
transcend
those
of
ordinary
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
due
course
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
maryland
had
just
passed
a
statute
of
abrogating
the
compact,
would
you
have
a
standing?
would
that
afford
your
original
action
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
decoration
of
abrogation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
nothing.
it
just
--
hereafter
redeem
the
compact
of
(inaudible),
but
it
takes
no
action
in
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
push
it
back,
suppose
the
governor
of
maryland,
a
governor
of
maryland,
in
his
annual
message
to
the
legislated
recommends
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
kind
of
a
brought
on
title
as
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
too
remote
and
vague.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
then
i
could
namely
merely
legislate
a
declaration,
raised
got
a
temporary
matter
on
and
we
got
(inaudible)
is
abrogated.
you
think
that
would
give
you
standing
(inaudible)
that
would
require
us
to
give
some
relief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
in
this
case
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
denying
that
are
breaches,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
and
i
ought
not
to
speak
of
it
anymore
because
you
said
you
will
consider
it,
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
what
are
called
technical
breaches
to
it,
i
don't
mean
to
minimize,
but
what
as
between
private
persons
would
be
clear
breaches
of
contract,
doesn't
ipso
facto
and
by
its
own
force,
kneel
this
court
to
bring
two
states
before
it
adjudicated,
but
you
said
it
again
and
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
more
than
damage.
it
isn't
just
damage.
you
take
the
plaintiff's
case
the
first
time
that
was
up.
god
knows
there
was
enough
damages,
that
too
it's
running
down
to
other
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
the
court
gave
some
very
strong
expressions,
when
you
deal
with
the
so
called
quasi
sovereign,
when
you
deal
with
the
dignity
of
state,
is
very
important,
plus
also
the
pressure
if
possible
to
have
them
to
settle
their
controversies
outside
of
court
than
within
court,
to
have
other
considerations
than
those
of
that
move
merely
as
between
private
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
not
to
what
if
this
is
the
law
what
will
be
your
next
step,
perfectly
legitimate
argument,
but
would
you
restrict
yourself
specifically
to
what
this
act
of
maryland,
legislation
of
maryland
to
the
oyster
industry
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
speak
specifically
concrete
with
reference
to
the
actual
incidence
of
the
restriction
or
the
damage
or
the
difficulties
that
are
caused
(inaudible)
to
virginia
fishery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
they
can
do
this,
than
they
can
do
something
else,
that
is
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
just
state
it
in
terms
of
the
number
of
fishermen
involved,
what
the
hampering
that
occurs
after
compared
with
what
was
before,
gives
us
a
vivid
concrete
picture
of
what
this
does
to
virginia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically
what
does
it
that,
that
requires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
--
what
range
of
license
fees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
per
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
maybe
forbidden
in
the
waters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
arrest
and
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
maryland
patrol
boat
could
take
their
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
patrol
boats
--
as
i
understand
the
compact
is,
joint
jurisdiction,
criminal
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
these
patrol
boats
mainly
for
the
protection
of
the
fishery
in
the
river?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
maryland
have
an
interest
to
protect
the
fisheries
or
not
an
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
wants
to
have
its
own
patrol
boats.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
not
resting
on
a
propriety
interest
of
the
state
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
1785,
had
virginia
and
maryland
had
negotiations
--
compact
doesn't
provide
an
arbitral
machinery,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
have
they
–
questions
have
arisen
since
1785?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
questions
had
been
settled
by
negotiation,
have
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
my
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
you
appointed
at
least
one
very
distinguished
nobleman
from
a
distinguished
government
i
know
about
this
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pennsylvania
and
the
attorney
general
or
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
other
instances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
with
reference
questions
arising
under
the
compact
have
there
been
other
negotiated
settlements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hicks
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
and
perhaps
the
two
minutes
it
will
take
the
chief
justice
to
be
good
enough
to
give
it
you.
this
may
well
may
be
unfair
question
is
not
an
intent,
it
carries
no
innuendo,
but
it
does
seem
to
be
a
little
relevant
in
my
own
thinking.
suppose
this
court
for
one
reason
or
another
would
feel
that
this
is
not
a
suit
to
entertain,
what
would
virginia
do
assuming
as
i
do
that
virginia
wouldn't
be
spared?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
recommend?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
then
have
a
military
controversy.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
suggesting
that
you
are
--
that
virginia
has
invited
the
military?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
any
attempts
been
made
to
say
let's
sit
down
talk
and
talk
this
over?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
an
invitation
you
indicate
on
the
part
of
virginia,
let's
come
down,
let's
sit
down
and
reason
together,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
legislation
by
contracts
supplanting
the
compact
as
an
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause
deal
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
sure
the
fish
hasn't
sailed
from
one
state
to
the
next
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
all
this
argument
directed
to
the
intention
by
maryland
that
compact
doesn't
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
no
legal
(inaudible)
is
that
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
an
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
when
it
was,
what
happened
since
1894
when
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
in
his
opening
arguments
in
wharton
against
wise
put
compact
of
1785
between
virginia
and
maryland
is
still
a
subsisting
agreement
and
appeared
the
attorney
general
in
person
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
up
here
to
defend
a
citizen
of
maryland
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
therefore
represented
the
interest
of
the
state.
what
happened?
when
did
the
agreement
evaporate
between
that
position
of
maryland
in
1894
and
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
this
court
can
then
sit
in
judgment
whether
the
circumstances
of
the
nature,
which
you've
indicated
justified,
a
unilateral
declaration
of
obsoleteness
or
termination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
that
the
determination
of
maryland
that
circumstances
have
arisen
or
had
arisen
which
involved
an
implied
revocation
or
termination
of
the
compact
is
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
i've
put
my
question
clearly
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
this,
is
it
a
justiciable
question
whether
the
circumstances
would
you
say
justified
maryland
in
saying
this
compact
is
no
longer
in
existence
are
in
fact
circumstances
that
are
justified.
of
course
if
we
take
jurisdiction,
we
take
jurisdiction.
what
am
i
asking
you
is
whether
this
court
is
entitled
to
take
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
question
at
all.
my
question
is
that
since
on
the
face
of
things
there
is
an
agreement,
a
compact
between
virginia
and
maryland
and
maryland
says
said
certain
facts
have
arisen,
events
have
come
to
pass
which
put
the
kind
of
termination
to
this
compact
that
impliedly
would
put
determination
if
people
have
written
out
their
thoughts
in
1785,
may
maryland
urge
that
as
a
subject
for
its
own
determination
or
is
the
existence
of
that
justification
itself
a
justiciable
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
maybe
by
found
by
a
court
it
has
misjudged
its
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
one
or
the
other,
if
it
must
have
been
either
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
either
citizen
or
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
is
that
on
the
face
of
things,
since
this
involves
x
number
of
fishermen
with
a
total
product
of
x
million
dollars,
it's
relation
to
the
whole
interest
of
economic
interest
of
state
of
virginia
is
too
small
for
the
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
secret
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
much
on
the
question
you
said
no
compact
we
got
a
very
different
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
private
dredging
mr.
kaufman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
--
this
illegal
dredging
as
you
call
it
was
private
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand,
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
my
question
was
a
little
different.
when
did
the
compact
evaporate
which
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
said
in
1894
was
subsisting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kaufman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kaufman
may
i
say
that,
if
you
will
let
me,
that
your
engaging
example
of
modern
--
products
of
modern
law
schools
in
which
pleadings
are
very
casual
and
informal,
but
there
is
something
left
to
pleading,
i
suspect
even
in
the
most
modern
of
law
schools,
and
in
what
the
state
of
maryland
put
in
over
your
signature,
it
is
that
you
waive
an
answer
and
in
effect
what
old
timers
like
me
call
it
a
demurrer
to
the
complaint,
that's
the
essence
of
it,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
what
you
put
in
for
maryland?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
waiving
yes,
you
haven't
--
but
you
didn't
put
that
in,
you
demur
to
this
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
fair
statement.
therefore,
what
we
have
before
us
is
whether
the
bill
on
its
face
makes
out
a
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everything
you've
said
the
last
15
minutes
which
i
have
listen
to
or
ten
minutes
was
genuine
interest,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
fall
within
your
demurrer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you're
raising
a
new
issue
which
i
must
say
is
an
important
issue,
but
not
within
the
pleadings
if
i
may
mention
that
now
obsolete
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kaufman
there's
a
well
known
principle
accepted
by
all
writers
on
international
law
(inaudible),
anyhow
as
far
as
i
know
it's
an
unchallenged
proposition
of
international
law
that
a
treaty
no
matter
how
binding
forever
carries
with
it
an
implicit
limitation
when
circumstances
drastically
change.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
between
real
sovereigns,
independent
nations,
there
is
no
answer
to
that
except
the
arbitrament
of
war
if
one
side
is
stiffly
standing
out,
but
the
whole
point
of
giving
this
court
original
jurisdiction
as
between
states
is
to
avoid,
is
to
substitute
as
this
court
has
said,
justice
holmes
said
in
that
missouri
case,
to
substitute
this
tribunal
for
force.
that's
exactly
what
this
jurisdiction
has
intended
to
confer
and
not
allow
one
of
the
parties
to
a
contract
to
decide
when
it
has
ceased
to
be
efficacious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
a
judicially
determination
if
the
other
party
doesn't
agree
and
they
can't
negotiate,
that
is
correct,
and
what
is
so
terrible
about
that?
i
suppose
that's
why
this
article
iii
was
written
as
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
legal
position
you
took
in
answer
to
this
motion
for
leave
to
file
this
bill.
you
said
if
this
court,
you
said
in
effect,
the
supreme
court
reads
the
bill
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
read
the
bill
and
you'll
find
that
it
doesn't
present
the
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
mr.
attorney,
also
a
fact
namely
that
virginia
had
some
of
its
patrol
boats,
i
forget
in
what
branch
of
the
virginia
government,
they're
serviced
out,
it
doesn't
matter,
the
state
of
virginia
has
been
patrolling
in
exercise
of
its
governmental
function
as
it
conceded
it
has
been
doing
that.
now
it
did
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
i
am
saying
that's
what
the
attorney
general
--
that's
what
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
that's
what
virginia
submits
to
this
court,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
so
or
not,
i
don't
know
whether
any
of
these
facts
are
so
without
bringing
into
question
the
good
faith
of
counsel.
now
assume
that
is
so,
and
assume
virginia
has
said
that
she
does
