mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
on
review
from
the
eighth
circuit
to
review
the
refusal
of
an
order
in
a
motion
requested
by
the
petitioner
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
equitable
jurisdiction
to
stay
in
order
to
cease
and
desist
issued
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
that's
the
sole
issue
in
this
case.
in
1949,
the
federal
trade
commission
filed
a
complaint
against
the
petitioner
alleging
that
it
had
discriminated
in
prices
along
it's
purchasers
in
violation
of
section
2
(a)
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
that
discrimination
consisted
of
offering
volume
discounts
to
all
of
its
customers.
that
discount
being
in
the
form
of
an
annual
discount
based
on
the
volume
of
purchases,
2000
to
3000,
3000
to
4000,
4000
to
6000
and
so
on.
it's
set
out
in
the
record,
each
amount
being
a
larger
discount.
the
record
shows
that
that
discount
in
some
form
or
other,
that
volume
discount
is
more
or
less
standard
practice
in
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry.
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry
consists
of
many
different
things.
in
the
case
of
moog
industries
for
the
sake
of
convenience,
they
have
leaf
springs,
chassis
part,
coil
actions
and
piston
rings.
they
have
three
classifications.
several
thousand
parts
intervene
the
lowest
various
classifications
adoptable
to
cars
going
back
as
far
as
1937,
the
various
types
of
car.
there's
no
question
that
these
volume
discounts
were
offered
to
all
their
customers.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
standard
practice
in
the
industry
to
offer
those
discounts.
the
record
shows
that
by
testimony
as
we
have
referred
to
it
in
our
brief
in
various
places.
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
exhibits
attached
to
the
record
which
show
contracts
for
volume
discounts,
mcquay
norris,
regal
tool
and
manufacturing,
thompson
products
as
typical
contract
showing
those
exhibits.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
all
before
the
commission.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
the
merits
of
this
case
and
not
before
the
court.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
sue
justice
whittaker
on
the
eighth
circuit
at
that
time,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
federal
trade
commission
that
there
had
been
a
violation.
and
in
addition
to
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
not
sought
an
enforcement
of
the
order,
when
they
affirmed
the
decision,
they
ordered
the
petitioner
to
file
its
certificate
of
compliance
within
60
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
order
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
when
that
order
was
entered,
we
filed
our
motion
to
state
that
order
and
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
equitable
jurisdiction
and
hold
it
in
the
bench
until
our
competitors
in
that
industry
were
subjected
to
like
orders.
otherwise,
we
would
be
placed
at
a
severe
competitive
disadvantage.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
out
of
the
18
or
20
that
are
named
in
the
record,
justice
douglas.
i
think
two
of
them
were
being
preceded
against
at
that
time.
in
the
nine
years
since
this
litigation
has
started,
the
federal
trade
commission,
according
to
its
brief,
has
filed
14
to
a
proceedings
against
members
of
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry.
out
of
those
14
complaints,
only
three
of
them
are
competitors
of
petitioner.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
it
might
take
longer
than
that
justice
douglas.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
well,
we
named
in
the
record
there
some
18
or
20
of
them
named.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
so
far,
there
has
been
nine
years
of
litigation
as
i
construe
this
record
from
what
the
federal
trade
commission
brief
says
to
proceed
in
nine
cases.
to
date,
they
have
filed
nine
cases
but
all
together
--
now,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
wrong
on
that.
they
have
filed
14
cases
but
all
of
them
have
not
proceeded
to
a
conclusion.
for
instance
one
against
our
largest
competitor
thompson
products
which
had
been
going
on
for
several
years
has
not
been
brought
to
a
decision
to
an
initial
decision
by
the
hearing
commissioner.
there
is
no
question
in
the
record
documentarily
and
from
testimony
that
its
standard
practice
in
the
industry.
and
the
question
arises
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
appellate
court
in
a
motion
of
that
sort.
it
is
my
understanding,
your
honors
that
a
motion
of
that
sort
is
more
or
less
ancillary
to
the
proceeding
for
this
reason.
the
federal
trade
commission
is
not
a
judicial
body,
these
(inaudible)
states.
therefore,
it
has
no
equitable
jurisdiction.
it
can't
decide
questions
of
equity.
so
let
us
start
first
(voice
overlap)
to
the
jurisdiction
of
an
appellate
court
by
looking
at
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
well,
justice
frankfurter
that
is
a
good
question
and
i'll
say
this
in
reply.
a
little
bit
further
in
my
argument
if
i
--
my
time
last
that
long.
in
the
cosmetics
industry,
the
commission
did
do
something
just
like
that.
they
file
eight
or
nine
proceedings,
one
of
them
being
against
elizabeth
arden.
and
while
elizabeth
arden
was
going
on,
they
entered
into
agreement
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
in
the
other
cases
to
hold
it
up
and
not
proceed
with
them
and
not
make
the
--
the
decree
final
against
there
--
elizabeth
arden
--
against
the
rest
of
them
until
elizabeth
arden
has
been
brought
to
a
final
conclusion.
it
is
in
their
words,
they
used
their
discretion
may
i
say
that.
i
don't
say
that
they
have
no
discretion
but
they
don't
have
due
equitable
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
held
that
they
are
not
a
judicial
body
but
they
can
use
their
discretion.
i
do
know
that
they
have
filed
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
yes,
sir.
they
entered
to
a
solemn
agreement
to
do
that.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
sir?
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
no,
there
were
against
other
concerns.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
all
pending
at
the
same
time
or
not.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
they
may
have
been
all
pending
at
the
time.
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
filed
simultaneously
or
not
justice
douglas.
but
i
do
know
that
they
entered
into
that
agreement
because
of
the
--
so
that
one
would
not
be
competitively
injured.
they
entered
--
they
would
all
be
entered
so
that
it
would
be
effective
at
the
same
time.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
it's
been
done
before.
it
was
done
in
the
chrysler
case.
it
was
done
in
the
ford
motor
case,
the
justice
department
has
recognized.
they
entered
into
an
agreement
with
ford
motor
company
and
they
entered
in
--
that
they
wouldn't
hold
that
against
them
for
--
any
longer
than
it
took
to
complete
the
general
motors
case
and
if
they
weren't
successful
in
the
general
motors
case
the
order
in
the
ford
motor
case
wouldn't
be
effective.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
sir?
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
that's
what
i
was
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
precisely.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
that's
exactly
what
i
was
getting
into
justice
frankfurter.
let's
see
what
the
statute
says
about
that
power.
section
21
of
the
act,
it
appears
--
i've
set
it
out
on
page
11
on
my
brief.
upon
the
filing
of
the
application
and
transcript,
the
court
shall
cause
notice
to
be
served
on
the
person
and
so
forth
and
shall
have
power
to
make
or
enter
on
the
pleading
testimony
and
proceeding
set
forth
in
such
transcript
a
decree
affirming,
modifying
or
setting
aside
the
order
of
the
commission
under
the
board.
now
that
phrase,
that
latter
phrase
appears
three
times
in
that
section
and
in
the
last
place
and
you
will
find
it
on
page
12,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
enforce,
set
aside
or
modified
orders
of
the
commission
board
shall
be
exclusive.
now
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
that
is
true
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
federal
trade
commission
don't
have
equitable
jurisdiction.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
oh,
no.
oh
no.
it
certainly
did.
now,
whether
it
has
power
to
exercise
that
discretion,
it's
a
very
serious
question
in
my
mind
and
that's
what
i
was
getting
to
when
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
statute
says
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
to
set
aside
or
modify
orders
of
the
commission
is
exclusive.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
wasn't
in
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
well,
it
was
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
yes,
this
one
does
not.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
contend
this.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
contend
that
not
alone
does
the
court
have
the
--
the
appellate
jurisdiction
to
do
this
but
it
has
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
well,
now
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
here
is
the
way
we
treated
that
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rules
of
the
federal
trade
commission
provide
for
a
trade
conference
practice,
trade
practice
conference
that
is
one
of
the
duties
delegated
to
it
by
congress.
in
1954,
april
1954,
your
petitioner
together
with
other
manufacturers
as
one
group
petitioned
the
federal
trade
commission
to
hold
a
--
call
a
trade
practice
conference
among
these
manufacturers
to
correct
the
very
abuses
for
which
they
were
filing
these
complaints
against
mostly
smaller
companies
like
ours.
ours
is
a
small
company
compared
to
the
big
ones
in
the
industry.
that
application
has
laid
there
since
1954
and
has
never
been
acted
upon.
in
addition
to
that,
that
same
year,
a
month
or
two
later,
some
200
wholesalers
in
the
industry
filed
a
similar
application
for
a
trade
practice
conference
to
correct
and
to
go
into
this
very
same
abuses
that
the
federal
trade
commission
is
complaining
about
because
they
were
receiving
discounts
and
for
being
liable.
they
wanted
to
get
it
correctly.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
done
nothing
in
that
respect.
a
year
later
--
a
year
later,
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
it's
correct
and
i'm
sure
the
federal
trade
commission
counsel
will
not
deny
it.
in
december
of
1955,
mr.
cassedy,
a
counsel
in
this
case,
wrote
to
the
chairman
of
the
commission,
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
trade
practice
conference
had
been
requested
by
these
manufacturers
as
one
group
and
the
wholesaler
is
another
group
and
that
no
action
had
been
taken
on
it
and
requested
and
prayed
that
call
this
trade
practice
conference.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
reasons
mr.
chief
justice
and
while
you
say
this
maybe
a
play
on
words.
i
don't
consider
it
a
play
on
words.
our
agencies
are
either
judicial
and
in
the
sense
they're
semi-judicial
but
they
don't
have
equity
jurisdiction.
whether
or
not
the
federal
trade
commission,
when
they
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
attorney's,
for
these
cosmetics
people
to
hold
up
any
action
until
final
decree
was
entered
in
the
elizabeth
arden
cases
so
that
they
can
all
work
together
and
then
work
under
the
same
rules
recognizing
the
competitive
disadvantage.
it
is
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
whether
they
have
that
right.
here's
what
they
did
in
the
lumber
industry,
in
the
algoma
case.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
my
recollection
is
all
the
cases
had
not
been
tried.
elizabeth
arden
was
the
first
one
tried.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
and
the
others
were
being
proceeded
and
elizabeth
arden
was
being
appealed.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
and
on
the
final
appeal,
the
agreement
was
again
entered
into
that
it
would
not
be
enforced
against
elizabeth
arden
until
a
final
decree
had
been
entered
in
the
last
of
the
eight
cosmetic
cases.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
would
say
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
may
i
put
it
this
way,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
power
to
make
effective
the
date
of
an
order
anytime
that
it
see
fit
it
chooses.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
they
can
have
the
power
to
relate
a
decree
effective
a
year
from
next
tuesday
if
they
want
to
or
eight
years
from
the
next
tuesday
if
they
want
to.
but
i
say
that
when
a
record
shows
as
this
one
shows
even
though
a
request
is
not
made,
there
is
no
waiver
of
the
right.
there
is
no
waiver
of
the
right.
unquestionably,
not
alone
has
the
court
of
appeals,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
modify,
affirm
or
set
aside
a
federal
trade
commission
order.
it
is
my
opinion
your
honors
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
gives
the
court
a
reasonable
equitable
jurisdiction
in
any
case
presented
to
it
at
any
time.
chief
justice
marshall
said
so
in
osborn
against
united
states
bank,
decided
by
this
court
many,
many
years
ago.
in
old
colony
trust
company
against
commission
of
internal
revenue,
that
was
a
case
where
the
question
was
referred
to
this
court
referring
to
a
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
and
referred
to
article
3
of
the
constitution.
article
3
of
the
constitution
as
you
know
says
that
the
judicial
power
extends
the
whole
cases
in
law
and
equity
arising
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
that
is
the
position
especially
where
the
record
shows
that
this
is
a
standard
practice
in
the
industry.
we
are
in
effect,
your
honors,
made
legal
guinea
pigs.
we're
a
little
concerned
in
a
two
and
a
half
billion
dollar
industry.
our
volume
in
1952
was
a
little
under
5,000,000.
we're
a
drop
in
the
bucket
in
the
big
industry
like
this.
we
can't
compete
with
other
concerns.
we
lose
customers
weekly
and
daily
to
our
competitors
who
are
still
offering
volume
discounts
who
have
not
been
proceeded
against.
when
they
go
and
say
“well,
we
can
give
you
a
cheaper
price.”
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
know
of
no
case
on
that
point
offhand
mr.
justice,
but
i
do
know
this,
that
this
court
held
in
old
colony
trust
company
against
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
that
on
the
petitioner
finding
of
an
executive
or
administrative
tribunal,
it
was
not
important
whether
the
proceeding
was
originally
began
by
administrative
or
executive
determination
if
when
it
came
to
the
court
and
that's
the
court
of
appeals.
if
--
when
it
came
to
the
court,
it
call
for
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
court
upon
which
jurisdiction
was
conferred
by
the
law.
and
then
in
that
same
case,
this
court
said,
at
page
723,
judge,
the
court
further
held
that
the
jurisdiction
and
that
cause
was
like
that
of
circuit
courts
of
appeal
in
review
of
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
cited
in
support
the
eastman
kodak
case
and
the
silver
against
the
federal
trade
commission
case.
now,
courts
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
have
done
it.
courts
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
have
done
it.
courts
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
have
done
it
and
court
of
appeals
in
my
own
eighth
circuit
did
it,
notwithstanding
justice
whittaker's
overruling
of
it.
they
did
it
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
case
that's
cited
in
the
brief.
now,
whether
it's
a
question
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
--
we
ought
to
raise
it
first
down
there
or
whether
we
ought
to
raise
it
originally
in
here
in
the
old
colony
case,
it's
says
it
has
the
original
jurisdiction
in
the
court.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
no,
the
only
one
that
i
know
of
where
the
commission
was
asked
to
withhold
its
order
was
in
the
niehoff
case
which
is
to
be
argued
right
after
mine.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
in
the
other
cases,
i
don't
think
it
was
raised.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
yes,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
think
so.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
very
much
so.
i'll
--
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i'll
tell
you
why.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
in
my
opinion,
this
federal
trade
commission
can't
make
a
finding
of
fact
on
something
on
which
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
it
would
have
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
and
the
--
the
government's
brief
says
that
there's
no
finding
of
fact
made
on
it.
they
can't
make
a
finding
of
fact
on
something
that's
beyond
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
i
said
that
but
your
honor
said
they
made
findings
of
fact
and
state
that
there
are
reasons
for
it.
there's
a
distinction
between
the
two.
if
the
federal
trade
commission
had
come
out
totally
and
said
“we're
going
to
make
this
order
effective
when
we
get
the
balance
of
the
industry
in
line.”
that's
one
thing.
but
if
the
federal
trade
commission
come
out
and
says
“for
the
reason
that
so
and
so
and
for
the
reason
that
so
and
so,
we
don't
consider
this
evidence
sufficient
and
makes
findings
of
fact.”
i
say
they
haven't
got
jurisdiction
to
make
those
findings
of
fact.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
no,
sir.
mr.
malcolm
i.
frank
not
unless
the
record
justifies
that
it
is
a
standard
practice
throughout
the
industry.
i
don't
mean
that
it
should
be
done
indiscriminately.
here,
it's
standard
practice
in
the
industry.
there's
no
denial
of
that
fact
that
there
are
rebates
and
discounts
on
piston
rings
and
replacement
parts
in
one
form
or
another
throughout
the
industry.
it's
just
the
same
as
years
ago
when
you
walk
and
--
when
my
daddy
used
to
walk
into
the
drugstore
and
bought
a
cigar
and
he
could
buy
one
for
10
cents
or
he
could
buy
three
for
a
quarter.
that's
the
cost.
it
was
quantity.
or
when
i
can
remember
very
well,
a
relative
of
mine
was
in
business
and
when
he
bought
thread
from
the
spool
cotton
company.
the
more
thread
you
bought
in
a
year,
the
bigger
credit
bonus
you
got
at
the
end
of
the
year.
quantity
discounts
are
in
grand
in
the
industry
of
commerce
in
almost
any
line
that
you
want
to
talk
about.
and
it's
awful
hard,
it's
awful
hard
to
just
uproot
it
and
say
to
this
one
and
this
one
you
can't
do
it
anymore
while
it
takes
years
to
get
the
rest
of
that
industry
in
line.
in
the
meantime,
we've
lost
customers.
the
federal
trade
commission
says
“well,
you've
got
a
remedy,
you
can
sue
them.”
well,
of
course
we
can
sue
them
but
that
don't
get
us
our
customers
back
and
money
damages
wouldn't
replace
the
lost
of
those
customers
that
are
gone
from
us.
there's
just
one
more
thing
if
i
may
indulge.
the
attorney
general
with
reference
to
price,
the
attorney
general's
committee
to
investigate
the
antitrust
back
said
in
one
paragraph
and
it's
referred
to
in
the
brief
and
it's
very
important
to
me
and
i
think
to
you
is
that
competition
where
it's
keen
and
a
reduction
in
price
in
order
to
meet
a
rival's
price
if
it's
forbidden,
forbidden
is
reductio
ad
absurdum.
that's
it.
thank
you
very
much
and
i
would
like
very
much
to
have
this
court
not
tell
the
trade
commission
what
to
do
in
it's
discretion
but
to
stay
this
order
until
the
federal
trade
commission
can
either
exercise
its
discretion
in
calling
a
trade
conference
or
bring
these
cases
against
our
competitors
to
a
conclusion.
thank
you
very
much.
