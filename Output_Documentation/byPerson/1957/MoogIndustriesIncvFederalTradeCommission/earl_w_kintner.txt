mr.
earl
w.
kintner
may
it
please
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
the
court.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
issue
--
the
underlying
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
almost
identical
nor
identical
to
that
in
the
case
previously
argued.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
commission
has
no
statutory
authority,
as
such,
to
issue
trade
practice
conference
rules.
it
does
so
in
its
general
administrative
capacity.
it
holds
--
it
has
established
a
purely
voluntary
procedure,
whereby
upon
petition
of
industry,
it
will
bring
the
industry
together.
there
will
be
a
discussion
of
the
applicable
law
to
the
practices
of
that
industry
and
then
on
its
final
and
only
motion,
the
commission
will
issue
trade
practice
rules
which
are
only
effective
so
long
as
they
reflect
the
actual
state
of
the
law.
there
is
no
penalty
for
the
violation
of
these
trade
practice
rules.
the
penalty
is
the
violation
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
it
is
entirely
voluntary.
they
do
not
have
to
sign
pledge
cards.
most
of
them
do.
there
are
trade
practice
conference
rules
for
i
believe
about
180
american
industries
covering
merely
the
whole
panorama
of
american
industry
and
yet,
we
still
have
our
cases.
the
rules,
as
i
have
said
are
only
so
effective
as
the
involuntary
statutory
law
enforcement
power
of
the
commission,
is
effective
in
its
day
to
day
work
in
the
issuance
of
complaints
and
in
the
holding
of
hearings.
and
finally,
the
issuance
of
cease
and
desist
orders
and
then
in
securing
compliance
with
those
cease
and
desist
orders
after
they
have
been
passed
upon
by
the
court
and
approve.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
agency's
work
and
these
voluntary
procedures
are
purely
are
ancillary.
we
hope
effective
and
that
we
think
they
are
in
many
instances,
but
only
so
effective
as
the
commission's
other
law
enforcement
work
or
the
involuntary
nature
in
effect.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir,
it
has
in
this
instance,
the
--
the
respondent
requested.
i
think
it
is
of
interest
to
point
out
in
its
proposed
finding
which
it
offered
to
the
hearing
examiner
from
the
commission's
--
and
i
quote,
“from
the
commission's
press
release,”
i
am
referring
to
a
proposed
finding
of
the
respondent
here,
a
record
at
page
975,
977.
“from
the
commission's
press
release
issued
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
herein,
it
is
clearly
evident
that
several
complaints
were
filed
at
the
same
time,
principally
directed
at
certain
buying
groups,”
and
then
so
forth.
it
is
submitted
that
before
filing
this
complaint,
the
commission
should
have
first
examined
respondent's
quantity
discounts
as
well
as
those
of
its
competitors.
if
the
commission
had
then
been
dissatisfied
in
any
respect
with
any
of
those
discount
filings,
it
should
have
proposed
discounts
which
it
felt
were
reasonable
for
the
industry
in
the
light
of
competitive
effects
and
the
actual
cost
savings
at
various
volume
levels
of
sales,
held
hearings
and
by
rule
eventually,
have
promulgated
fair
and
equitable
quantity
discount
limits
applicable
to
all
competitors
in
the
field.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
this
was
a
suggested
finding
after
the
case
had
been
tried
for
many,
many
months.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
was
contended
that
this
was
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
expression.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
after
--
after
there
has
--
has
been
an
establishment
of
the
violation
of
the
law
and
after
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
was
raised,
we
think,
in
this
particular
proposed
finding
and
the
commission
rule
on
it.
i
refer
you
to
a
language
in
the
commission's
opinion,
which
you
will
find
that
--
at
the
record,
page
1026.
the
commission
stated,
“stating
that
an
order
requiring
the
respondent
to
terminate
against
unlawful
discriminations
will
destroy
the
niehoff
business,
when
its
competitors
are
not
likewise
enjoined,
appellant
request
that
this
proceeding
be
held
in
advance
until
the
commission
can
place
all
industry
members
under
identical
restrictions.
the
pricing
practices
used
by
the
respondent,
however,
have
been
found
to
be
in
violation
of
the
law
since
or
continuance
by
the
respondent
is
likewise
unlawful.
“the
commission's
duty
under
the
applicable
statute
is
to
require
their
termination
forthwith
that
respondents
business
maybe
at
adversely
affected
by
the
requirement
to
cease
its
unlawful
conduct,
does
not
counterbalance
the
president
which
would
beset
by
the
requested
action
which
it
followed.
it
would
mean
that
commission
orders
would
be
forever
pending
and
unlawful
practices
rarely
if
ever
corrected.”
on
that
language,
the
commission
bottomed
its
decision
not
to
hold
in
advance
issuance
of
its
cease
and
desist
order
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
same
industry,
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
oh,
they
were
not
competitors
in
their
particular
lines.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
this
instance,
the
--
the
industry
covered
the
practices
or
the
lines
of
ignition,
testing
equipment
and
hydraulic
equipment.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
other
industry
was
pistons
and
springs.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
difference
in
product
and
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
respondent
gave
discounts
of
zero
to
17%
and
sold
to
at
least
one
buying
group.
there
was
a
breakdown
of
volume
discounts
in
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
findings
and
i
believe
it
is
referred
to
in
the
court's
opinion
below,
as
to
the
volume
discounts
of
10
of
the
competitors.
two
granted
no
volume
discounts
at
all,
one
granted
a
maximum
of
15%,
five,
20%,
one,
23%
and
one,
25%.
none
of
the
10
coincided
with
the
maximum
17%
of
the
respondent
here
and
seven
of
the
10
had
a
higher
maximum
than
the
respondent
here.
there
was
an
analysis
of
522
comparative
prices.
among
these
10
competitors,
226
were
higher
than
those
of
the
respondent.
152
were
lower
and
144
were
the
same.
numerous
complaints
were
issued
in
this
industry.
i
have
mentioned
that
16
covered
the
2
(a)
or
price
discrimination
features
alone
and
the
buying
groups
have
also
been
concurrently,
preceded
against.
there
are
i
believe
24,
total
of
24
complaints
in
this
industry
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
commission
has
committed
over
the
nine-year
period
25%
or
more
of
its
price
discrimination
law
enforcement
dollar
to
this
one
industry.
certainly,
i
think
some
indication
of
the
fact
that
it
had
--
it
has
used
its
administrative
discretion
enforcing
a
law
to
the
fullest
within
the
means
that
it's
disposable.
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
it
was
unwilling
to
participate
in
the
economic
death
of
a
law
violator.
however,
the
court
below
may
well
have
ordered
the
execution
of
other
innocent
violators.
i
have
reference
to
these
independent
jobbers
who
have
been
forced
to
join
the
buying
groups
as
a
means
of
securing
more
favorable
prices
from
these
manufacturers.
thus,
setting
in
the
motion,
a
ground
of
illegality,
pattern
of
illegality
which
is
never
ending
and
respondent
asked
that
this
court
confirmed
into
the
law,
into
the
administrative
process
something
which
would
constitute.
i
say
it
advisably,
a
law
enforcement's
nightmare
were
to
become
a
part
of
any
person
or
the
administrative
agency.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
and
yet,
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
this
field
involved
the
federal
communications
commission.
and
there,
there
was
a
complaint
because
the
federal
communications
commission
had
--
unless
this
is
the
pottsville
broadcasting
case,
had
consolidated
three
cases.
and
this
court,
speaking
through,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
courts
are
not
charged
with
general
guardianship
against
all
potential
mischief
in
the
complicated
task
of
the
government.
interference
by
the
courts
is
not
conducive
to
the
development
of
habits
of
responsibility
and
administrative
agencies.
and
then,
the
court
went
on
to
point
out
that
what
is
the
issue,
is
not
the
relationship
of
the
federal
courts
and
to
say
a
relationship
define
largely
by
the
courts
themselves,
but
to
do
observance
by
the
courts
of
the
distribution
of
authority
made
by
congress
as
between
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
and
the
reviewing
power
which
it
has
conferred
upon
courts,
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
we
believe
that,
your
honor,
spoke
just
as
meaningfully
in
the
case
of
scripps-howard
radio
versus
f.c.c.
in
1942
case,
when
it
--
when
your
honor
said
generally
speaking
judicial
review
of
administrative
orders
as
limited
to
determining
whether
errors
of
law
had
been
committed,
because
of
historical
differences
between
the
administrative
bodies
and
reviewing
courts
and
that
between
upper
and
lower
courts,
a
court
of
review
exhaust
its
power
when
it
lays
bare
a
misconception
of
law
and
compels
correction.
what
mr.
--
what
judge
parker
was
referring
to
in
the
american
chain
&
cable
case,
when
he
sent
back
to
the
administrative
agency,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
hold
in
advance
its
order
and
said,
“without
my
full
--
without
intermitting
what
action,
if
any,
should
be
taken
by
the
commission
on
the
motion
of
petitioners.”
in
other
words,
it
was
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
agency.
it
should
decide.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it's
so
great
--
so
great
is
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
so
great
is
the
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
so
great
is
the
power
of
the
court
under
--
of
an
article
3
court
under
the
constitution
that
i
hesitate
to
flatly
say
that
this
question
shall
never
be
subject
to
review,
because
it
is
a
part
of
the
function
of
the
courts
to
make
sure
that
administrative
agencies
do
exercise
due
process.
but
it's
even
more
incumbent
upon
those
agencies
if
the
administration,
if
the
administrative
process
means
anything
that
they
in
the
first
instance
and
using
that
great
discretion
given
to
them
by
the
congress,
do
exercise
a
full
measure
of
due
process,
do
lean
over
backwards
to
a
court,
fairness
and
equality
of
treatment
to
all,
similarly
circumstance.
i
believe
that
and
i
believe
also
that
the
commission
in
these
instances
has
done
so,
has
leaned
over
backwards
to
treat
those
similarly
situated
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
to
clean
up
the
--
the
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
most
certainly
do,
sir,
in
the
same
way
that
a
court
must
do
so.
in
other
words,
justice
cannot
be
weighed
out
pound
by
pound
like
potatoes
or
sugar.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
either
in
the
courts
or
in
the
administrative
agency.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
the
commission
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
effect,
the
commission
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
right.
the
commission
in
effect
said
that
it
would
not
exercise
its
discretion
in
this
instance.
in
fact,
the
case
had
been
primarily,
tried
upon
other
issues.
respondent
attempted
two
principal
defenses,
a
cost
justification
defense
and
a
defense
that
its
practices
were
made
in
good
faith
--
in
good
faith
to
meet
competition.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
did
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
--
no,
sir.
not
--
not
entirely.
while
the
case
primarily
was
tried
with
respect
to
the
question
of
these
two
defenses
and
then
of
course,
collaterally
with
respect
to
the
--
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
injury
to
competition,
there
was
evidence
submitted
by
the
hearing
examiner
in
the
record,
with
respect
to
the
pricing
practices
of
some
of
respondent's
competitors.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
--
the
application
was
made
to
the
hearing
examiner,
in
effect,
in
proposed
findings
and
to
the
commission
during
oral
argument
of
this
matter
on
the
merits
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
all
the
merits
with
respect
to
whether
an
order
would
be
proper
in
this
instance
and
were
it
proper
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
held
in
advance
until
all
similarly
situated
competitors
were
brought
to
book.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
right.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
the
chronology
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
commission's
case
was
tried
in
11
months.
the
respondent's
case
defense
took
two
and
half
years.
the
matter
was
in
the
administrative
decisional
process.
that
is
the
briefing
before
the
hearing
examiner
and
the
briefing
before
the
commission
for
one
year
and
it
has
been
before
the
courts
for
two
and
a
half
years.
now
again,
this
is
not
a
typical
case
because
it
involved
a
--
a
practice
that
has
--
has
been
pointed
was
common
at
least
superficially
to
certain
parts
of
the
industry,
if
not,
a
substantial
part
of
the
industry.
it
involved
a
new
industry
which
had
not
been
previously
examined
by
the
commission.
and
necessarily,
the
--
the
first
impression
cases
were
long
cases
and
the
case
was
brought
with
respect
to
a
statute
which
has
provide
certain
defenses,
which
respondents
are
entitled
to
avail
themselves
of
and
not
necessarily
as
time
consuming.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
now
this,
i
believe,
is
the
whole
record.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
were
many
delays
while
accountants
examined
the
cost
accounting.
cost
justification
is
a
very
difficult
and
technical
problem.
and
the
respondents
were
given
every
reasonable
opportunity
to
adduce
any
evidence
which
might
be
favorable
to
their
cause.
perhaps,
the
commission's
examiner
was
too
lenient
in
that
regard,
but
i
for
one
would
rather
see
more
time
elapsed
and
the
ends
of
justice
better
served,
if
that
does
become
necessary.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
please
the
court.
mr.
sprowl
has
mentioned
the
smallness
of
his
concern.
in
the
eyes
of
the
commission,
it
is
a
principal
factor
in
the
industry.
the
two
principal
competitors
of
this
concerned
are
sorensen
and
p.&
d.,
both
of
whom
have
outstanding
cease
and
desist
orders
entered
against
them
affirmed
by
courts
of
appeal.
the
respondent
herein
has
a
volume
--
annual
volume
of
about
$2
million,
sorensen
and
p.&
d.,
$1,685,000
and
$1,300,000
respectively.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
within
the
past
few
months,
there
have
been
six
orders,
three
of
them
--
four
have
been
either
or
have
been
before
this
court.
the
two
cases
--
two
instant
cases,
the
edelmann
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari,
request
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
whittaker
case
where
the
--
this
court
denied
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
sorensen
and
p.&
d.
cases
affirmed
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir,
two
of
them.
sorensen
and
p.&
d.
are
included
upon
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
of
the
niehoff
competitors.
that's
the
difficulty
and
niehoff
refers
to
16
or
18
competitors,
but
it's
the
same
situation
i
mentioned.
a
and
b
compete
with
c.
c
competes
with
a
and
b,
but
also
competes
with
d
and
e,
those
that
you
have
a
never
ending
situation.
each
competitor
and
each
person
in
the
industry
has
--
has
different
competitors.
they
--
it
is
not
a
--
an
industry
and
a
margin
of
this
industry
where
each
competes
with
the
other,
but
it
is
an
industry
of
75
lines
where
some
factors
such
as
niehoff
here
handle
only
three
lines
and
are
preempted
in
one
ignition
as
our
p.&
d.
and
sorensen.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
we
expect
to
move
to
secure
compliance
against
them
as
well
as
others,
against
whom
the
commission
has
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
is
correct,
the
sorensen
case
sustained
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
the
p.&
d.
sustained
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
they
have
the
60-day
period
in
which
they
may
comply
with
the
order
and
then
they
may
ask
us
on
a
staff
level
for
an
additional
60
days
and
then
we
start
negotiations,
serious
negotiations
to
bring
--
adjust
their
business
practices
and
that
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
is
a
long
arduous
process.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
before
we
go
back
to
the
courts
for
assistance.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
would
certainly
be
a
matter
which
you
should
bring
to
the
commission's
attention.
the
--
the
--
at
the
compliance
stage.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
well,
that
would
be
a
--
it
could
be
a
defense
under
certain
circumstances
in
the
original
proceeding,
the
meeting
of
an
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor.
actually,
there
are
various
defenses
other
than
the
two
mentioned.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
he
--
he
can
raise
that
defense
of
meeting
competition
at
the
second
and
the
third
stages
of
the
proceeding.
he
can
raise
it
when
the
commission
proves
the
second
violation
and
goes
to
a
court
of
appeals
for
a
decree
of
enforcement
and
then
he
can
bite
his
time
and
after
the
commission
has
proved
to
its
satisfaction
a
third
violation
and
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
ask
for
contempt.
he
can
still
tell
the
court,
“well
after
all,
all
i
was
doing
was
meeting
competition.”
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
he
can
do
it
at
anyone
of
the
three
stages,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that's
what
makes
that
law
so
difficult
to
enforce.
we're
doing
the
best
we
can.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
sprowl
was
referring
to
the
so-called
2
(b)
defense
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
which
is
really
another
lawsuit
and
a
very
difficult
subject
as
--
subject
matter
as
your
honor
appreciates.
but
there
is
such
a
defense
and
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
sprowl
says
that
under
certain
circumstances,
he
--
he
would
use
that
defense
and
could
use
it
and
the
fact
is
that
in
this
instance,
the
--
his
--
his
client
did
vigorously
contend
to
use
a
defense
and
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
he
certainly
did,
sir,
and
lost
on
the
other
defense
that
he
used.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
same
time
that
he
was
making
this
defense
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
he
was
piously
saying,
“well,
we
--
we
think
you're
wrong
here.
we
--
we
--
we're
going
to
defend
ourselves.
we're
vigorously
defending
ourselves,
but
at
the
same
time
we
want
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
certain
of
our
competitors
you
haven't
proceeded
against.
you've
got
to
get
them
too,
regardless
of
whether
our
defense
wins
or
loses
in
this
case.”
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
hope
so,
but
if
i
haven't,
judge
finnegan
has
in
his
dissent
in
the
lower
court.
he
says
that
it
appears
that
the
majority's
modification
compels
the
commission
to
investigate
or
complete
examination
of
niehoff
competitors
at
the
risk
of
(inaudible)
and
otherwise
approved
order,
whether
this
entails
all
19
competitors
or
a
baker's
dozen
is
unrevealed.
my
grave
doubts
that
our
statutory
power
to
modify
federal
trade
commission
orders
can
be
converted
into
policing
and
supervision
--
supervising,
though
perhaps
obliquely,
the
length
and
breadth
and
sequence
of
commission
investigations
brings
me
to
the
position
i
now
take.
certainly,
we
would
refuse
to
activate
the
commission
upon
a
bare
petition
for
mandamus
to
investigate
the
automotive
ignition
industry,
responsibility
of
achieving
enforcement
of
the
statutes
congress
assigned
to
the
commission
lies
elsewhere.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
practical
effect
if
the
commission
were
forced
to
this
--
to
these
depths
would
be
that
all
would
go
scot-free
because
in
effect,
the
commission
would
never
complete
an
administrative
procedure.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
oh,
yes,
sir.
this
would
be
another
set
of
facts.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
if
i
were
advising
his
client.
i
advised
his
client
to
look
into
that
situation
meeting
competition.
i
don't
think
they're
obliged
to
sell
at
one
price.
i
don't
think
they're
obliged
to
sell
at
their
maximum
price.
i
don't
know
what
price
they'll
have
to
adopt
or
what
prices
to
comply
with
the
order
here,
but
it
is
incumbent
on
them
to
reexamine
their
business
practices
just
as
it
is
this
entire
industry
to
reexamine
its
business
practices.
counsel
says
he
hasn't
had
any
notice.
he
should
have
read
the
morton
salt
case.
he
should
have
read
the
various
decision
of
the
commission
which
cast
grave
doubt
on
the
validity
of
these
cumulative
annual
discount
arrangements.
typically,
they
have
had
no
basis
or
relationship
to
cost.
it
is
not
to
say
that
per
se
illegal,
but
typically,
i
say
they
have
had
no
--
they
--
there
were
no
relationship
to
cost
and
it
was
incumbent
upon
any
counsel
conversion
with
the
law
to
examine
such
accumulative
annual
discount
rebate
system
of
pricing.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
made
reference
to
the
cosmetics
case,
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
entered
into
an
understanding
that
the
court's
decision
in
the
elizabeth
arden
case
would
bind
the
parties
with
respect
to
other
pending
proceedings
which
were
at
various
stages
of
the
administrative
process.
the
commission
exercised
it's
discretion
as
in
its
law
enforcement
capacity
in
entering
into
this
understanding.
it
did
subsequently
dismissed
six
--
those
six
pending
cases
and
attempted
--
and
did
have
a
trade
practice
conference
to
suggest
rules
of
conduct
for
the
parties
and
it
is
a
fact
that
after
the
trade
practice
conference
and
after
they'd
all
signed
the
pledge
card,
the
commission
found
it
necessary
to
institute
an
industry
wide
investigation
of
the
cosmetics
industry.
it
issued
complaints
against
three
of
those
against
whom
it
had
dismissed
the
cases
and
the
other
three
had
signed
the
pledge
cards.
this
illustrates
graphically,
i
think,
the
fact
that
these
voluntary
procedures
of
the
commission
indeed
of
any
law
enforcement
agency
are
no
better
than
scraps
of
paper
unless
they
are
backed
up
by
firm
enforcement
of
the
laws.
it
is
true
that
there
was
an
application
for
a
trade
practice
conference
in
1954
with
respect
to
certain
segments
of
this
industry.
it
is
also
true
since
we've
gone
beyond
the
record
that
the
department
of
justice
subjected
to
the
holding
of
that
trade
practice
conference
because
it
then
had
under
investigation
certain
segments
of
the
industry
and
it
was
not
--
and
it
is
not
the
department's
policy
nor
that
of
the
commission
to
settle
by
trade
practice
conferences,
matters
which
are
in
litigation
or
where
substantial
amount
of
investigative
authority
has
been
exercised
and
substantial
amounts
of
the
public's
money
spent
to
investigate
the
practice
or
where
there
is
real
controversy
with
respect
to
the
legality
or
illegality
of
the
practices
in
question.
it
is
true
that
there
was
another
application
in
1957,
but
these
cases
were
then
in
litigation.
the
commission
had
filed
16
price
discrimination
complaints
in
this
particular
industry,
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
had
filed
16
companion
cases
or
two-way
cases
in
this
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
my
judgment
sir,
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
because
in
price
discrimination
cases,
each
respondent
has
certain
defenses,
the
cost
defense,
the
defense
of
good
--
of
meeting
competition;
the
question
indeed
in
the
first
instance
of
whether
he
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
finally,
the
all
important
question
which
makes
these
cases
so
complicated
and
so
lengthy
in
many
instances,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
the
requisite
injury
to
competition
or
the
tendency
to
--
toward
monopoly
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
to
the
extent
that
there
were
certain
pricing
practices
being
engaged
in
by
certain
segments
of
the
industry.
counsel
is
right.
but
it
is
not
necessarily
true
that
all
of
these
pricing
practices
of
all
members
of
the
industry
were
violative
of
the
law.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
commission
has
not
found
it
possible
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
do
this.
if
it
were
able,
it
would
have
exercised
its
administrative
discretion
to
do
so.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
fact
that
each
respondent
has
a
cost
justification
defense
under
the
statute
available
to
him.
the
cost
of
one
respondent
may
not
be
the
cost
of
another.
each
respondent
under
the
statute
has
a
possible
defense
of
good
faith
meeting
of
the
competition.
and
in
this
industry,
there
were
seven
--
there
were
approximately
75
lines
of
products,
each
product
in
many
instances
broken
down
into
sub
lines
with
literally
thousands
of
parts
within
some
particular
line.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
only
to
the
extent
that
some
of
his
competitors,
we
believe,
because
we've
issued
16
complaints
in
this
industry,
do
use
annual
volume
discounts
either
rebating
in
--
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
cash
or
in
merchandise.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
certainly
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
problem
might
graphically
be
expressed
by
--
by
this
example
that
a
and
b
compete
with
c
in
this
industry,
but
c
competes
with
d
and
e.
there
would
be
a
never
ending
succession
of
competitors,
one
of
it
competes
with
another
and
then
with
two
others
in
such
a
proceeding.
the
case
--
the
proceeding
would
never
end.
there
would
never
be
an
order
issued,
an
effective
order
by
the
commission.
and
as
to
the
practices
of
each
of
these
competitors,
there
would
come
into
play
the
defenses
of
the
act
and
above
all
the
question
of
whether
or
not
each
pricing
practice
of
each
have
the
requisite
adverse
effects
as
required
by
the
statute
upon
the
competition.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
now,
there
had
been
instances,
notably,
the
lead
pigment
industry
and
the
cement
industry
where
the
--
the
factors
in
the
industry
were
tied
together
in
a
price
fixing
conspiracy
or
combination
where
their
practices
were
uniform.
there,
the
commission
has
exercised
its
discretion
in
issuing
a
price
discrimination
count
with
respect
to
the
--
the
conspiracy
portion
of
the
complaint
and
has
cleaned
up
the
industry
in
the
one
proceeding.
but
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
have
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
we
have
collected
evidence
and
as
it
has
appeared
to
the
commission
that
the
statute
may
be
violated.
the
commission
has
proceeded
to
issue
its
complaint
and
has
proceeded
to
hold
its
administrative
hearings
as
speedily
as
possible.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
interestingly
enough
mr.
justice
harlan,
one
of
respond
--
of
petitioners,
principal
competitor's
sealed
power
has
signed
a
consent
settlement
with
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
expect
and
can
only
expect
when
the
commission
issues
complaints
against
individuals
in
an
industry
charged
with
violating
the
law
that
once
the
principles
or
practices
therein
involved
have
been
litigated
and
passed
upon
by
the
courts
that
others
in
the
industry
similarly
situated
will
fall
into
line.
if
they
do
not
of
course,
the
commission
must
proceed
to
investigate
as
the
practices
of
competitors
are
called
to
its
attention
and
to
issue
complaints
and
hold
hearings
within
the
limits
of
his
--
of
its
budget.
for
example,
here,
during
a
nine
year
period,
25%
of
the
price
discrimination
complaints
issued
by
the
federal
trade
commission,
during
that
nine-year
period
have
been
issued
in
this
particular
industry.
the
commission
has
moved
vigorously
to
stand
proud,
practices
which
it
believes
are
unlawful
in
the
industry.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
now
that
is
a
very
interesting
question
and
requires
some
background
detail
at
this
point.
the
commission's
attention
was
invited
to
the
fact
that
the
jobbers
who
are
the
customers
or
petitioner
here
and
others
similarly
situated
were
that
certain
jobbers
were
receiving
better
prices
than
others
because
those
jobbers
belong
to
buying
groups.
the
buying
groups
were
able
to
secure
from
petitioner
and
others
far
better
prices
than
the
individual
members
were
able
to
secure
in
their
own
negotiations.
members
of
the
buying
groups
bought
individually.
they
individually
ordered.
shipments
were
made
individually,
but
they
were
billed
through
the
buying
group,
a
mere
book
keeping
device
in
our
view
to
avoid
the
law.
the
situation
is
graphically
illustrated
by
the
dallas
situation.
there
were
six
customers,
our
petitioner.
four
of
them
belong
to
jobbing
groups
and
secured
discounts
of
12%
to
15%.
two
did
not
belong.
one
jobber
didn't
get
any
discount.
the
other
jobber
who
was
the
largest
one
in
the
area
got
7.29%
discount.
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
record
indicates
that
this
industry,
the
jobbing
end
of
it,
operates
on
a
4%
or
less
net
profit
basis,
so
that
the
discount
that
the
largest
jobber
was
not
receiving
simply
because
he
didn't
belong
to
this
bookkeeping
transaction.
it's
terribly
important
to
him
in
his
survival
as
an
independent
businessman
and
it
was
because
the
commission
found
that
these
buying
groups,
these
bookkeeping
devices
were
pervading
the
industry
that
it
moved
against
the
manufacturers
who
were
according
the
prices
to
the
buying
groups.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
first
place,
we
don't
believe
that
all
of
the
manufacturers
in
the
industry
are
engaged
in
the
same
pricing
practice.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
to
those
who
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
as
to
those
in
the
industry
who
are
engaged
in
according
annual,
volume,
discount,
rebates
based
upon
cumulative
purchases
during
the
year
as
to
those.
each
in
a
proceeding
would
have
here
a
separate
defense
that
his
price
is
valid
because
he
is
simply
according
a
differential
based
upon
the
cost
of
doing
business
or
that
he
accords
this
price
differential
based
upon
the
fact
that
he's
meeting
the
competition
of
a
competitor
in
a
certain
area.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
we
have
proceeded
against
the
buying
groups.
we
have
some
10
complaints
pending
against
the
buying
groups
or
receiving
the
--
the
unlawful
price
discriminations.
they
in
turn
of
course
have
their
defenses.
but
as
to
each
of
these
respondents,
they
would
have
each
their
various
defenses
and
then
there
would
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
individually
they
were
entering
competition
and
each
would
have
varying
lines
of
competitors.
they
sell
different
products
in
this
industry
and
each
has
a
variety
of
competitors,
some
common
and
some
not
common
one
or
the
other.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
commission
uses
its
administrative
discretion
in
practically
and
i
believe
all
orders
that
it
issues
to
require
compliance
within
60
days
of
a
forthwith
order
and
the
courts
have
sustained
scores
of
such
orders
and
have
made
it
a
part
of
the
court's
judgment
that
compliance
shall
be
had
within
60
days.
once
an
order
of
the
commission
has
been
issued
in
a
case
of
this
character
and
has
been
affirmed
by
court
of
appeals,
there
comes
the
arduous
process
of
securing
compliance
with
that
order.
first,
there
is
the
60-day
waiting
period
during
which
respondent
may
adjust
its
business
and
must
at
least
convince
the
commission
of
its
good
faith
and
effort
to
comply
with
the
order.
the
division
of
compliance
which
is
lodged
in
my
office
has
authority
on
its
own
motion
and
without
reference
to
the
federal
trade
commission
to
grant
an
additional
60
days
during
which
respondent
may
use
good
faith
in
attempting
to
adjust
his
business
practices.
and
then
after
all
that
and
assuming
that
respondent
has
not
satisfied
the
commission
that
it's
using
good
faith
and
attempting
to
comply
with
the
order,
after
all
that,
the
commission
then
enters
into
the
second
stage
of
the
proceeding.
it
goes
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
phrase
an
enforcement
of
the
order.
and
even
that
doesn't
end
the
procedure.
the
commission
must
detect
a
third
violation
and
must
go
again
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
enforce
the
order
to
the
court's
contempt
power.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
it
is.
it
has
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
it
has
been
evolved
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
ruberoid
case,
343
u.s.
470
at
page
476
where
this
court
held
that
such
procedures
so
far
as
the
second
and
third
stage,
were
required
by
the
statute.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
--
the
instance
here,
the
two
cases
have
--
have
been
in
gestation
nine
years,
two
and
a
half
of
those
before
the
court's
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
don't
think
it's
entirely
typical,
but
the
commission
finds
that
next
to
the
price
fixing
industry
wide
price
fixing
cases
that
these
two-way
cases
under
the
robinson-patman
law
are
very
difficult
and
lengthy
if
respondent
wishes
to
try
out
all
of
the
defenses
available
to
it
and
all
of
the
issues
which
may
properly
be
examined
under
the
law.
we
must
rely
upon
establishing
precedent
and
then
bringing
the
rest
of
the
industry
into
compliance.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
that
--
i
would
go
further
than
that
and
say
that
the
case
would
never
end.
the
possibilities
for
litigation
are
such
that
half
the
antitrust
part
would
be
gainfully
employed
for
half
a
century.
that
is
the
result
which
the
commission
devoutly
does
not
seek
part.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
may
it
please
the
court.
in
replying
to
questions
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
it
might
be
relevant
to
point
out
concerning
the
pricing
practices
of
the
petitioner
here.
that
the
pricing
practice
complained
of
and
which
it
alleges
is
common
to
the
industry,
was
only
superficially
common
to
substantially
--
substantial
portions
of
the
industry.
for
instance,
in
its
own
three
principal
lines,
the
respondent
has
a
different
price,
maximum
price
with
respect
to
each
of
those
lines,
0%
to
19%
in
its
coil
line,
0%
to
15%
in
its
leaf
spring
line
and
0%
to
20%
in
its
piston
line.
this
court
in
the
--
i'm
turning
very
briefly
to
cases
which
we
think
govern
in
this
instance.
this
court
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
wabash
railroad
said
--
had
this
to
say,
the
suppression
of
abuses
resulting
from
violations
would
be
rendered
practically
impossible
if
the
commission
referring
to
the
i.c.c.
were
required
to
suppress
all
simultaneously
or
none.
section
12
(1),
imposes
on
the
commission,
the
duty
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
act.
that
duty
would
hardly
be
performed
if
the
commission
were
to
define
--
decline
to
enforce
it,
against
one
because
it
could
not
at
the
same
time
enforce
it
against
all.
and
many
years
later,
judge
medina
graphically
following
that
line
of
reasoning
in
a
clayton
act
proceeding
section
3
case
said
that
preliminarily,
it's
been
noted,
that
potential
or
even
probable
adverse
effects
on
petitioner's
business
alone
is
not
sufficient
basis
for
withholding
injunctive
relief,
where
we
to
hold
otherwise,
we
would
quite
effectively
draw
the
teeth
of
section
3
and
the
antitrust
laws
generally.
it
appears
self
evident
that
any
provision
upon
behavior
which
tightens
competition
will
necessarily
endure
to
the
immediate
economic
disadvantage
of
the
individual
or
business
organization
engaged
in
that
behavior.
essentially,
the
problem
raised
here
in
this
appeal
is
one
that
is
common
not
only
to
the
federal
trade
commission's
submission
of
law
enforcement
but
is
a
common
--
a
problem
common
to
all
law
enforcement.
it
was
as
ever
been
does
that
those
charge
to
a
violation
of
the
--
of
the
law
say
to
the
administrator
or
the
person
engaged
in
enforcing
the
law,
get
my
brothers
who
are
equally
guilty
before
you
get
me
and
bring
me
to
book.
it
was
us,
when
i
was
a
state
prosecuting
attorney
more
than
a
decade
ago
and
it
is
thus
the
day
with
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
there
had
been
situations
of
that
character.
typically,
the
price
fixing
situations
where
the
respondents
where
using
a
common
business
practice
found
to
be
unlawful
and
there
the
commission
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
even
there,
where
the
practices
were
precisely
the
same,
the
commission
has
issued
its
two-way
count.
here,
the
practices
are
not
precisely
the
same
nor
would
the
defenses
available
to
the
respondent's
be
the
same.
where
it
can
and
supportive
as
it
is
able,
the
commission
thus
move
against
the
principal
factors
in
an
industry
and
situations
of
this
character
as
indeed
it
has
in
this
instance.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
commission,
in
each
instance,
must
determine
whether
or
not
to
proceed
in
that
case
at
that
time
or
to
wait
the
investigation
of
other
cases
and
to
file
several
complaints
at
one
time
against
an
industry
involving
similar
practices.
the
--
it
uses
its
administrative
discretion,
its
law
enforcement
discretion,
a
discretion
which
from
time
immoral
and
our
judgment
has
been
used
by
law
enforcement
authorities
whether
they'd
be
district
attorneys
or
administrative
agents.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
court,
as
judge
finnegan
pointed
out
in
the
niehoff
dissent,
in
the
niehoff
case
would
be
interfering
in
the
administrative
process
and
exercising
a
judgment
which
belongs
peculiarly
and
is
peculiarly
within
the
province
of
the
administrative
agency.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
do
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
do,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
it
takes
care
certainly
of
this
industry,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
in
that
instance
involving
buying
groups,
the
commission
has
moved
against
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
it's
possible
--
altogether
possible
that
even
in
this
instance,
there
might
have
been
a
defense
available
to
one
of
those
factors
that
might
not
have
been
available
to
another.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
matter
of
defenses
is
not
--
is
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
not
a
matter
--
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
--
the
government.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
the
defense
is
claimed
by
the
respondent.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
have
been
an
issue
where
the
commission
to
issue
a
complaint
in
one
of
those
instances.
the
issue
would
have
been
whether
or
not
the
statute
violates
it.
the
commission
would
have
had
to
have
made
in
its
administrative
capacity,
the
determination
against
how
many
of
those
respondents
to
have
or
to
proceed
against.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
the
commission
can
be
forced
to
exercise
its
administrative
discretion
as
it
was
in
the
american
chain
and
cable
case
were
judge
parker
in
that
circuit
said
that
the
commission
should
have
ruled
upon
a
motion
to
hold
in
advance
the
order
during
war
time
and
at
the
request
of
the
war
navy
department.
the
court
didn't
say
that
the
commission
should
have
granted
the
motion.
it
said
that
the
commission
should
have
taken
jurisdiction
over
the
motion
and
ruled
on
it,
exercising
its
administrative
discretion.
i
think
that
necessarily
the
problem
of
how
the
commission's
spends
its
law
enforcement
dollar
against
whom
it
must
proceed
is
one
which
it
must
make
in
its
capacity
as
a
quasi
prosecutor
if
you
will
in
its
administrative
capacity.
and
then,
once
it
proceeds
as
the
statute
says
it
must
do,
if
it
finds
the
probability
of
law
violation.
once
it
proceeds,
the
statute
further
says
that
if
it
finds
the
facts
are
that
the
law
has
been
violated,
it
shall
issue
its
cease
and
desist
order.
and
then,
once
again,
there
comes
into
play
after
the
issuance
of
the
cease
and
desist
order
and
as
in
here,
the
affirmance
or
review
by
the
court,
there
comes
into
play
the
commission's
discretion
with
respect
to
securing
compliance
with
that
order
and
the
two
future
stages,
the
courts
of
appeal
are
brought
into
the
act.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
it
would
be
a
dereliction
of
the
--
perhaps
of
the
commission's
duty
to
word
the
congress
in
performing
its
statutorily
assigned
duties
with
respect
to
enforcement
of
the
law.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
and
i
hesitate
--
i
hesitate
as
the
chief
legal
officer
of
an
administrative
agency
to
deny
the
courts
ever,
their
privilege
of
ruling,
that
an
administrative
agency
has
abused
due
process.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think,
that
under
the
--
it's
a
matter
of
the
assignment
of
the
respective
duties
to
the
commission
and
to
the
courts
of
appeal
or
the
handling
for
the
enforcement
of
the
robinson-patman
and
other
statutes.
it's
a
--
a
reasonable
division
of
authority
of
the
administrative
--
purely
administrative
on
one
hand
and
the
courts
review
on
the
other
hand.
and
i
believe
that
the
--
your
question
can
only
be
resolved
by
an
examination
of
what
the
congress
has
done
with
respect
to
division
of
powers
between
the
administrative
agency
and
the
courts.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
i
think
that
the
commission
had
used
its
discretion
to
examine
in
all
the
facts
with
respect
to
an
industry,
had
made
findings
on
which
a
court
might
properly
say,
“you
are
wrong,”
has
not
--
such
evidence
that
would
justify
those
findings
or
you're
wrong
on
the
law,
then
comes
into
play
the
court's
of
power.
mr.
earl
w.
kintner
none
whatsoever,
mr.
chief
justice.
