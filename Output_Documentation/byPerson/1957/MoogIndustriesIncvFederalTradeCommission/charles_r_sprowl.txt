mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
supreme
court,
mr.
kintner.
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
specific
language
of
the
statute,
which
gives
to
the
federal
trade
commission
the
power
to
place
for
the
time
within
which
any
order
it
entered
goes
into
effect.
it
appears
in
--
in
the
section
11
at
page
4
of
the
commission's
brief,
stating
the
power
of
the
commission
towards
the
end
of
the
second
paragraph
that
it
accurately
finds
a
violation
that
shall
issue
in
cause
to
be
served
on
such
portion,
an
order
referring
such
person
to
cease
and
desist
from
such
violations
and
then
taking
up
at
the
end
in
the
manner
and
within
the
time
fixed
by
said
order.
so
the
commission
does
have
the
power
to
fix
the
time
within
which
cease
and
desist
order
will
become
effective.
and
by
the
same
token,
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
eastman
kodak
case
would
have
a
like
power
since
the
commission
is
in
turn
vested
with
that
power.
in
this
particular
case,
niehoff
company
manufactured
primarily
a
line
of
ignition
parts,
replacement
parts
for
automobiles.
it
has
19
competitors,
three
of
whom
are
the
big
three
in
the
automotive
industry,
ford,
general
motors
and
chrysler
and
16
other
competitors
of
the
aftermarket
variety
like
niehoff.
proof
was
made
of
the
identity
of
all
of
those
competitors
at
a
hearing
held
may
15,
1952.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that
was
at
the
very
outset
of
the
respondent's
case.
immediately
thereafter,
that
was
the
beginning
of
our
defense
that
we
had
much
competition
in
this
field
that
we
were
perhaps
meeting
there
equally
low
prices
in
good
faith,
but
that
also,
we
would
be
seriously
hurt
if
we
were
placed
under
an
injunction
while
our
competitors
were
free
of
a
similar
restraint.
after
that,
the
commission
did
see
fit
to
file
complaints
against
two
of
our
competitors,
but
it
is
not
seen
fit
to
act
as
to
any
other
competitors
in
the
meantime.
i
think
the
record
makes
it
clear
what
really
happened
here.
the
commission
started
it
out
in
the
first
instance
to
bring
test
cases
against
buying
groups
in
the
automotive
industry.
the
job
for
buying
groups,
it
was
bond
together
to
build
up
volume
and
qualify
for
a
higher
quantity
discounts.
it's
--
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
issued
against
the
niehoff
company,
it
primarily
issued
its
complaint
against
members
of
a
buying
group
called
cotton
states.
and
its
publicity
release
show
that
the
time
that
those
complaints
were
issued
including
one
against
the
niehoff
company,
it
was
clear
that
they
then
issued
two
or
three
complaints
against,
i
believe,
niehoff
and
a
company
named
edelmann
in
an
unrelated
line
of
automotive
replacement
parts
and
perhaps
one
other
to
round
out
the
picture.
obviously,
the
manufacturers
at
that
point
were
the
caboose
on
this
train
of
enforcement.
at
a
little
later
in
this
proceeding,
about
the
same
time
this
evidence
was
being
put
in
as
to
the
nature
of
niehoff's
competition,
we
made
proof
of
the
fact
that
while
the
commission
had
in
the
meantime
proceeded
vigorously
against
niehoff,
it
started
to
show
that
it
had
done
nothing
in
the
cotton
states
matter.
that
stirred
up
the
tempest
and
they
shortly
started
to
turn
their
wheels
in
cotton
states,
but
the
point
is
that
the
reason
the
whole
proceeding
in
this
ignition
field
is
so
poorly
conceived
by
the
commission
is
what
they
started
out
to
do,
was
to
police
group
buying
and
they
ended
up
merely
trying
to
get
the
niehoff
company
which
sells
ignition
parts
under
a
cease
and
desist
order.
at
every
stage
of
this
proceeding,
we
not
only
made
proof
of
our
competition
of
the
fact
that
they
used
substantially
similar
discounts.
we
gave
them
the
copies
of
their
contracts
that
were
being
used.
we
put
them
in
evidence.
we
gave
them
dates,
names
and
places.
we
may
prove
to
the
fact
that
if
we
were
under
such
an
injunction,
while
our
competitors
were
not
similarly
enjoined
in
this
highly
competitive
field,
we
would
be
put
out
of
business
by
the
order
and
they
all
fell
on
deaf
ears.
when
we
got
down
to
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
and
i
wish
to
say
that
i
don't
recall
the
reasons
for
the
delay
in
this
case
why
did
mr.
kintner
explained
this.
i
recall
one
substantial
delay
because
the
commission
made
it
clear
that
they've
run
out
money
at
that
point
for
the
current
year
for
travelling
and
what
we
put
over
the
hearings
for
several
months
until
their
next
physical
budget
came
into
effect
which
we
did.
the
--
there
was
extensive
time
taken
in
this
matter
in
cross-examination,
in
our
case
by
the
commission
attorneys
which
explained
some
part
of
the
delay
and
the
printed
book
is
not
the
complete
record
of
the
commission
in
bringing
this
case
up.
it
does
not
see
fit
to
bring
up
the
exhibits,
which
were
filed
as
exhibits
unprinted
in
the
court
below.
when
we
came
before
the
--
to
the
point
where
we
have
to
make
request
for
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner,
we
made
two
requests.
one
was
really,
merely
a
conclusion
of
fact
that
the
commission's
action
was
an
abusive
discretion.
i
believe
that's
our
last
request
of
finding
75.
and
then,
we
have
141,
which
detailed
the
fact
that
niehoff
--
the
evidence
would
show
that
niehoff
would
be
put
out
of
business.
it
will
replace
under
this
order
while
its
competition
was
not
similarly
treated.
as
to
one
of
those,
the
hearing
examiner
found
it
was
beyond
his
jurisdiction
and
as
to
other
he
refused
to
make
a
finding.
and
then,
before
the
federal
trade
commission
as
such
on
appeal
from
the
hearing
examiner's
decision
and
a
brief
which
we
filed
or
dated
november
15th,
1954.
we
devoted
an
extensive
portion
of
that
brief
to
this
particular
request,
all
the
matter
in
advance
or
to
further
order
or
do
something
while
they
took
action
against
our
competition
and
that
section
set
forth
the
evidence
which
showed
that
niehoff
would
be
financially
ruined
by
the
order
if
its
competition
were
free
of
the
order
in
the
meantime
and
that
is
the
portion
of
our
brief
and
the
argument
that
related
to
an
oral
argument
which
prompted
the
comment,
which
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
on
the
issue
before
this
court,
i
would
--
i
would
doubt
that
more
than
50
or
100
pages.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
because
it
was
printed
out
in
full
in
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
think
it's
just
a
--
that
was
the
record
as
we
printed
it
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit.
and
then,
they
--
then
they
added
to
it
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
put
a
new
cover
on
it,
and
that
--
and
that
was
filed
at
the
time
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
you're
--
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
think
he
was
speaking
of
his
own
jurisdiction.
here,
we
were
asking
the
hearing
examiner
to
find
that
the
commission,
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
guilty
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
perhaps
through
sensibility
of
his
own
part,
he
preferred
not
to
make
such
a
finding.
i
don't
really
know
what
was
in
his
mind
but
i
think
he
meant
beyond
his
own
personal
jurisdiction,
but
we
did
make
the
point
at
every
stage
of
this
proceeding.
and
we
--
when
we
took
the
matter
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeal,
that
was
one
of
our
assignments
of
error
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
acted.
now,
there's
no
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
yes.
yes,
it
was
and
i
was
asked
questions
concerning
that
way.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
only
argued
it
to
the
--
i
think,
i'm
the
only
that
argued
it,
as
i
recall
it
and
i
merely
made
a
statement
of
fact
but
i
probably
would
like
--
i
repeated
the
evidence
as
it
showed
that
niehoff
would
be
put
out
of
business.
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
none
--
none
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
never
suggested,
no,
except
for
what
might
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission.
that's
the
only
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
it's
just
what
you
read,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
all.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
gather
that's
what
he
said,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
it
might
well
be
and
they
have
done
it
that
way
in
the
past.
my
point
is
simply
this.
have
they
seen
fit
at
the
time
they
filed
a
complaint
against
niehoff
to
understood
the
automotive
and
ignition
parts
replacement
industry
or
have
they
--
when
we
made
the
proof
of
the
nature
of
it
or
just
a
year
or
so
later.
it
seemed
fit
through
then
filed
a
complaint
separately
if
you
wish
against
these
16
or
17
competitors.
we
would
not
be
in
this
position
where
one
company
to
which
the
niehoff
company
is
out
of
step
and
everyone
else
is
free
to
use
this
volume
discount
methods
of
sale.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
the
order
of
the
commission?
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
believe
the
commission's
order
was
entered
late
in
50
--
middle
of
1954.
so,
that
was
over
four
years.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
about
four
years.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i'm
satisfied
we
wouldn't
be
here
for
this
reason
and
i
have
an
experience
with
the
commission
on
a
similar
matter
not
too
many
years
ago.
it
brought
a
multiple
complaint
against
a
group
called
the
fashion
originators'
guild
that
they
had
to
do
with
this
handling
and
keeping
of
piracy
out
of
dressmaking
in
new
york.
they
included
in
that
many
retail
stores.
it
was
adjudicated
to
be
an
improper
practice,
the
principles
of
manufacturers
decided
to
appeal
at
the
second
circuit.
such
door
is
out
in
our
way,
marshall
field
and
company
in
chicago
and
a
company.
i
know
a
store
in
detroit.
it
was
then
faced
with
a
proposition.
if
we
don't
appeal,
the
order
will
be
final
as
to
us
and
it
might
be
reversed
as
to
the
manufacturers.
so,
we
filed
the
skeleton
appeal.
i
recall
one
from
marshall
field
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
one
for
hudson
in
detroit
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
stipulated
over
the
commission
that
we
would
abide
the
result
of
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
and
it
worked
beautifully.
and
there
is
no
reason
why
in
this
proceeding
against
the
16
people
at
the
similar
complaints
being
filed.
we
would
have
been
more
than
happy
to
stipulate
it
to
abide
the
result
anyone
of
those
cases
on
the
fundamental
proposition
of
the
legality
of
quantity
discounts
of
the
nature
that
are
used
in
the
industry
and
i
think
it
would
have
greatly
simplify
it.
that
was
the
very
thing
we
have
urged.
we
were
urging
and
talking
about
throughout
this
proceeding,
because
certainly
the
niehoff
company
is
--
is
not
anxious
to
spend
its
money
and
pioneer
in
the
law.
it
only
finds
itself
at
an
impossible
position
and
that
it's
compelled
to
do
what
it
is
now
trying
to
do
to
keep
itself
from
being
put
out
of
business.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
the
first
time
we
asked
the
commission,
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
members
of
the
commission,
was
at
the
time
we
filed
our
brief
with
the
commission,
which
was
our
--
actually,
our
first
appearance
before
them
and
the
day
to
that
brief
is
november
15,
1954
and
i
don't
recall
when
the
arguments
were
that
followed
their
filling
of
that
brief
that
it
was
within
30
or
60
days
thereafter
that
it
was
repeated
in
oral
argument.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
about
4
years.
but
we
had
in
the
meantime
made
it
known
to
the
hearing
examiner
and
to
the
counsel
supporting
the
complaint
to
our
federal
trade
commission
attorney
in
the
course
of
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
when
we
asked
for
a
finding
that
the
commission
was
guilty
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
bringing
the
proceeding,
he
refused
to
make
the
finding
and
with
probably
some
propriety.
he
felt
it
was
beyond
his
jurisdiction
to
make
such
a
finding.
however,
he
admitted
the
evidence
in
the
record
into
the
--
he
admitted
into
the
record
the
evidence
which
we
offered,
which
showed
that
niehoff
would
be
put
out
of
business
if
it
were
placed
under
this
restraint
while
its
competitors
were
not
similarly
enjoined.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
the
methods
in
which
the
commission
operates
are
a
little
mysterious
to
me
and
i
think
properly
so
they
shouldn't
tell
the
source
of
the
basis
of
the
people
who
are
asked
to
give
them
information
which
might
lead
to
complaint
that
i
assume
many
of
them
are
secret,
but
we
did
nothing
other
than
make
the
proof
in
this
record
and
then
argue
it
orally
to
the
commission.
we
did
not
write
any
separate
letter
or
separate
complaint
to
the
commission
or
file
any
separate
motion.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
absolutely.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
and
that's
all
we
were
asking
the
commission
to
do.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
i
can't
believe
it
would
be
so
here,
because
my
whole
thesis
in
this
case
has
been
that
never
before,
until
this
case
and
the
one
or
two
cases
in
the
automotive
industry
somewhere
until
it
were
filed
were
the
quantity
discounts
as
such
attacked.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
bruce's
juices
cases,
it
would
be
a
far
cry
to
just
say
that
all
quantity
discounts
were
just
illegal
per
se
and
they
--
they
haven't
been
determined
to
be
illegal.
it
was
in
a
sense
a
--
a
landmark
case.
now,
i
say
that
the
commission,
when
they
are
out
to
attack
a
brand
new,
for
the
first
time
an
established
method
of
pricing,
they
shouldn't
go
around
the
barn
and
first
start
out
in
a
humbling
way
against
some
group
of
buyers
and
decide
that's
maybe
more
than
they
want
to
buzz
with
at
the
moment
and
then
proceed
against
the
--
one
of
the
manufacturers
without
making
some
more
critical
study
of
the
--
of
the
industry.
and
it
was
a
prior
to
us
that
they
hadn't
made
it,
so
that's
why
we
made
the
proof
of
the
fact
that
this
wasn't
a
big
industry.
there
are
only
18
competitors,
16
of
which
are
the
small
ones
and
the
ones
that
we're
interested
in.
it
isn't
a
big
job
for
you
to
file
16
complaints.
it's
just
a
matter
of
merely
grabbing
what
you
have
against
us
and
putting
a
different
name
on
it
because
the
issue
is
the
same.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
the
--
of
the
further
defenses,
i
--
i
take
issue
with
mr.
kintner
on
that.
admittedly,
every
respondent
has
the
defense
of
after
--
in
a
case
involving
whether
or
not
he's
guilty
of
illegal
pricing
of
showing
that
he
either
did
it
in
good
faith
and
made
an
unequally
low
price
with
a
competitor
or
the
cost
justification
offense.
your
honors
pointed
out
in
the
ruberoid
case
even
after
they
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
those
two
defenses
are
inherent
in
the
order
whether
it's
--
well,
to
have
those
exceptions
or
not.
so
actually,
once
you
get
to
the
point
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
--
to
get
to
a
point
of
a
cease
and
desist
order,
really,
all
you
need
is
to
establish
that
the
general
pricing
system
they're
using
is
illegal,
that
they
may
have
defenses
as
--
as
to
certain
sales
within
their
surprising
policy
because
at
one
point
they
met
the
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor
or
that
some
part
maybe
or
is
or
might
in
the
future
be
cost
justified.
those
exceptions
are
inherent
in
the
cease
and
desist
order
as
your
honors
pointed
out
properly
in
the
ruberoid
case.
so
it
wasn't.
it
--
it
could
have
been
once
you're
over
the
hurry
that
this
type
of
--
of
discount
is
an
illegal
pricing
method
under
the
federal
trade
commission
under
section
2.
it
isn't
a
serious
problem.
that's
the
big
issue
in
the
case
and
i
--
i
just
can't
believe
that
it
would
take
all
of
the
time
and
effort
that
mr.
kintner
would
indicate
or
in
an
ordinary
law
of
this
you
think
nothing
of
making
18
suits
instead
of
one
and
--
and
carrying
them
along
together,
it
--
as
to
where
the
portion
of
their
budget
goes
in
the
automotive
industry.
i
think
mr.
kintner
is
referring
not
to
the
ignition
field
of
the
automotive
replacement
parts
industry
which
niehoff
was
in
but
perhaps
the
entire
automotive
industry
which
is
so
vast,
i
couldn't
begin
to
describe
its
limits.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
the
candy
industry?
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
no,
but
when
the
respondent
himself
suggest
it
and
makes
it
clear
that
to
do
what
they
are
doing
will
put
the
respondent
out
of
business.
it
was
entered
--
it
amounts
to
an
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
and
failing
to
take
some
other
action
against
its
competitors
and
i
think
it
is
abuse
and
abuse
of
the
commission's
discretion
failed
to
act
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
to
correct
an
abuse
of
--
of
discretion
by
the
commission.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
--
alter
any
question
about
it.
they
would
want
to
make
their
defenses,
but
my
point
is
that
have
they
--
have
the
commission
acted
with
any
reasonable
dispatch,
even
insofar
as
1954
after
we
not
only
made
the
proof
with
the
competitors
were
in
the
nature
of
their
pricing
with
the
decision
that
they
had
in
the
niehoff
case
that
they
held
in
advance
a
year
or
two
or
three
which
would
have
been
long
passed.
now,
they
could
have
had
complaints
and
proceeded
to
a
point
where
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
problem,
but
they
just
sought
it
not
to
act.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
do
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
think
where
the
industry
is
no
greater
than
these
16
or
18
that
were
concerned
with
here.
there
--
there
--
the
evidence
shows
that
they
are
not
in
violation.
the
point
is
that
they
are
the
dominant
factors
and
these
other
people
have
to
place
their
merchandise
under
it.
it's
the
--
it's
the
15
little
ones
or
16
little
ones
that
have
the
discount
that
(inaudible)
and
ford
do
not.
they're
just
merely
in
there
as
competitors.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that
is
exactly
what
i
say
and
i
would
say
that
would
not
be
the
case
had
10
years
ago,
had
there
been
an
adjudication
that
this
type
of
pricing
was
illegal,
then
--
then
we're
unnoticed.
we've
known
all
this
time
that
it's
illegal,
but
here
where
they
are
attacking
it
for
the
first
time.
i
think
that
it's
only
fair
in
the
break
and
take
handy
cases
and
all
the
other
types
of
cases
where
they
knew
how
to
do
it.
they
have
done
it
that
way.
they
bring
in
all
the
people
under
complaints
and
one
way
or
another,
in
the
building
around
that
goes
into
that
type
of
a
proceeding
against
an
established
practice
in
an
industry,
you
end
up
with
one
specimen
case
going
on
up
finally
for
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
issue.
it's
been
done.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
none
at
all.
the
only
language
in
it
was
--
that
i
was
able
to
find
was
we
know
that
--
that
there
are
certain
types
of
discounts,
there
have
been
questions
such
as
in
the
salt
cases
where
there
was
a
discount.
it
was
available
only
to
the
one
limited
type
of
very
large
purchase.
but
as
your
--
this
court
pointed
out
in
bruce's
juices.
we
aren't
saying
that
so
far
from
saying
that
all
quantity
discounts
are
just
rendered
illegal
per
se
and
it
was
the
feeling
of
the
industry
that
they
were
not
illegal
and
when
they
were
reasonable
and
available
to
every
customer
within
reasonable
interest
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
otherwise.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right,
but
i'm
not
permitted
to
discuss
that
here.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
16.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right,
but
it
wouldn't
take
it
on
a
terminable
language
and
not
a
few
proceeding
against
them
all
at
once.
i
--
i
think
that
had
we
done
that
here,
we
--
we
would
have
no
problem
and
even
if
they
issued
cease
and
desist
order,
that
problem
is
always
present
even
after
a
cease
and
desist
order
has
been
acted.
you're
then
brought
into
a
proceeding
charged
with
violation.
you
are
still
entitled
to
show
that
no
i'm
not
violating
because
although
i
did
deviate
the
price,
i
did
it
either
(a)
because
i
met
an
equally
low
price
with
a
competitor
or
(b)
i
can
cost
justify
the
discount.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
true
even
after
the
orders
are
rendered.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
no,
i
don't
think
the
commission
could
curtail
their
right
to
make
their
defenses.
my
point
is
that
they
should
have
started
this
long
ago
when
we
first
suggested
that
it
isn't
--
the
fault
doesn't
lie
in
our
door.
we
--
we
are
--
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
now.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
say
this
that
it
--
it
this
is
affirmed,
that
it's
a
simple
enough
matter
for
the
commission
to
show
on
--
on
affidavit
or
motion
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
that
we
now
have
the
cease
and
desist
orders
against
this
competitor
and
that
competitor
and
the
next
competitor
and
--
and
it
certainly
doesn't
have
to
be
against
18,
because
i
can
sit
down
with
mr.
kintner
drawing
the
10
principle,
small
competitors
that
were
concerned
with
and
that
showing
would
be
sufficient,
i'm
sure,
to
get
the
entry
of
the
order.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
yes
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
no,
because
(voice
overlap).
yes,
there
are
some
of
those
that
are
admittedly
small.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
it
seemed
to
me,
your
honor
that
they
would
--
should
be
able
to
issue
the
complaint
and
carry
it
through
their
own
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
the
respondent
and
get
a
commission
order
within
24
months,
with
the
--
with
the
question
of
the
general
legality
of
the
pricing
system
now
settled
by
the
decision.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that
is
correct.
well,
i
won't
--
i
won't
put
it
that
way
of
--
that
we
are
not
as
you
have
established
to
anybody's
satisfaction.
there
are
only
two
defenses
they
can
make,
either
that
they
meet
an
equally
low
price.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
i'm
certain
to
this
that
they
are
using
an
illegal
pricing
method
and
i
can't
assume
that
everyone
of
their
sales
is
illegal,
but
i
--
i
am
sure
that
there
--
they
would
susceptible
of
a
cease
and
desist
order.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
well,
if
the
decisions
in
our
case
are
correct.
there
is
very
little
they
can
do
in
the
way
of
cost
justification.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right,
but
we're
--
we're
about
the
smallest
in
the
group.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
one
of
the
smallest
in
the
group.
$2
million
is
our
annual
gross
sale.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
say
that
there
--
no,
there
are
some
that
are
larger
and
some
that
are
about
the
same
size.
there
aren't
any
money
that
can
be
much
smaller
because
you
can't
manufacture
and
sell
in
this
business
with
much
less
volume
than
that.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
oh,
no.
i
think
they
first
have
to
permit
all
the
evidence
to
be
adduced
in
the
way
of
defense.
they
have
to
make
their
proof,
but
my
point
is
they
have
decided
that
this
type
of
pricing
method
is
illegal
now.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
once
you
have
a
cease
--
whether
before
after
the
cease
and
desist
order
is
entered
as
your
honors
stated
in
the
ruberoid
case,
the
statutory
defense
is
that
they're
always
inherently
available,
even
though
if
you're
charged
of
violating
that
order.
you
can
still
show
that
the
reason
you
reduced
your
price
was
to
meet
the
equally
low
price
the
competitors
would
pay
or
you
can
show
that
you
did
it
on
a
cost
justification
basis
and
that
is
inherently
read
into
every
cease
and
desist
order.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
not
on
the
very
same
thing.
let's
say
we
went
to
a
uniform
price
after
the
order
is
affirmed
which
we
would
have
to
do,
but
that
to
keep
one
customer,
we
cut
our
price
10%
in
the
dallas
area.
that
would
be
in
my
mind
defensible
even
though
we
were
under
a
cease
and
desist
order.we
did
it
in
good
faith
to
keep
a
customer
we
already
have.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right,
after
the
entry
of
the
order.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
thank
you.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
only
like
to
say
one
thing,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
perhaps
i
have
misled
the
court
on
the
2
(b)
defense.
the
type
of
2
(b)
defense
that
niehoff
was
endeavoring
to
make
in
this
case
was
that
you
aren't
required
to
meet
a
competitor's
price
locally
at
the
point
of
sale
to
keep
a
customer,
but
it's
--
you
come
within
the
defense
if
you
meet
a
nationwide
pattern
of
price
discounts
established
by
your
competition
and
that,
the
court
has
held
in
this
case
that,
“no,
that
is
not
a
2
(b)
defense.”
it
isn't
sufficient
to
show
that
in
good
faith,
you
granted
these
discounts
which
aren't
quite
identical
to
any
competitor
discount
but
are
substantially
about
the
same
of
every
competitor's
discount
and
you've
done
it
nationwide
as
a
consistent
method
of
meeting
their
discount
in
competition
that
you
are
not
really
establishing
a
cost
justification
defense.
so,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
our
cost
justification
then
did
accept
for
a
very
isolated
situation
where
we
might
have
lowered
the
price
to
keep
an
established
customer
which
i'm
sure
the
commission
would
let
us
report
and
would
never
make
a
court
case
out
of
it
because
it's
so
isolated
in
local
situation.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that
is
--
that
is
the
point
i
am
making.
in
other
words,
if
i
have
--if
niehoff
should
have
a
customer
in
detroit
at
which
it
is
selling
at
its
least
price,
then
a
standard
manufacturing
company
which
is
one
of
niehoff's
principal
competitor
shows
up
and
says,
“look,
i
can
sell
you
this
same
product
and
it
is
the
same
at
10%
lower.”
then,
niehoff
is
entitled
to
lower
its
price
to
keep
that
customer,
but
that's
very
--
that's
a
local
situation.
i'm
sure,
even
after
a
cease
and
desist
order
is
entered,
that's
the
type
of
thing
you
would
report
to
the
commission
and
i
--
there
is
no
question.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
it
would
be
very
difficult.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
perhaps,
from
a
legal
standpoint,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
i
don't
think
--
after
the
cease
and
desist
order
is
out,
i
think
that
perhaps
if
we
were
--
if
we
knew
of
it
and
we
knew
it
was
a
bona
fide
attempt
on
standards
to
cut
the
price
and
--
and
we
were
satisfied
to
that
then
even
though
we've
gone
to
a
single
price,
i
think
2
(b)
would
permit
you
to
put
the
practicalities
and
you
never
know
it
until
they
both
say
it.
mr.
charles
r.
sprowl
that's
right.
they've
--
they
have
taken
the
customer
and
then
we
know
about
it
and
we
can't
get
them
back.
thank
you.
