well,
that
was
something
that
he
wanted
to
do
before
they
initiate
the
proceeding.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
said
that
the
commission's
failure
to
follow
any
procedures
vested
under
before
filing
this
complaint
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
are
considering
here
--
we
are
considering
here
the
remedy
--
the
remedy
to
be
acquired
after
the
violation
of
law
has
been
established.
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
did
they
raise
that
point
before
the
commission
that
the
remedy
should
be
deferred?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
yet
you
can't
sue
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
must
assume
there
was
a
violation
here.
we
don't
have
a
question
of
the
merits.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
we
assume
there's
a
violation.
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
those
competitors
have
been
preceded
against
by
the
commission
at
that
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
it
take
another
nine
years
to
get
it
presented
in
this
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
those
were
the
companion
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
those
were
companion
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
i
mean
they
were
pending
at
the
time.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
were
eight
or
nine
and
one
was
on
appeal
and
they
decided
they
hold
(inaudible).
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
this
like
--
here
in
this
court,
we
sometimes
hold
the
case
because
other
cases
are
about
to
require
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
believe
they
would
wait
at
nine
years
so.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
think
that
they
would
wait
nine
years.
