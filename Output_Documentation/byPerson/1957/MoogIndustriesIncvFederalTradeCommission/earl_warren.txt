you
may

--
chief

--
mr.
kintner.
chief
justice

yes.
mr.
sprowl.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sprowl,
when
--
when
the
examiner
stated
that
this
was
beyond
his
jurisdiction,
was
he
speaking
only
beyond
the
scope
of
his
authority
as
an
examiner
or
is
he
speaking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sprowl,
i
--
in
the
--
in
the
last
case,
i
understood
mr.
kintner
to
say
that
the
commission
was
already
spending
25%
of
its
promulgation
in
enforcing
in
this
particular
field,
you
folks
are
again
(inaudible)
percentage
and
i
just
wonder
if
--
if
that
fact
bears
on
the
least
submissive
--
the
commission
not
undertaking
to
bring
suits
against
everyone
in
this
--
in
this
field
because
you
said
before
you
have
helped
the
commission
out
in
their
money
gram,
how
can
he
come
and
continue
it
[laughs]
in
a
few
months.
i
wonder
if
a
few
industries
couldn't
tie
them
up
in
that
matter
until
they
couldn't
--
couldn't
possibly
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sprowl,
your
time
has
expired,
but
we
thank
you
so
much
for
your
time
in
question
for
the
--
if
in
rebuttal
we
would
like
to
ask
a
few
more
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
summarize
your
argument
(inaudible)

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
the
--
can
the
court
modify
or
set
aside
the
order
of
that
commission
or
any
other
for
some
reason
that
hasn't
been
raised
before
the
commission
itself?
now,
as
i
understand
it,
in
this
case,
you
did
not
raise
that
issue.
you
never
ask
the
commission
to
--
to
withhold
its
order
until
it
had
gone
through
the
same
procedure
with
the
rest
of
the
--
of
the
industry.
but
here,
you
--
you
ask
the
court
to
modify
or
--
or
set
aside
an
order
of
the
--
of
the
commission
on
a
point
that
was
never
raised
before
the
commission.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
it
have
--
i
thought
you
said
a
little
while
ago
as
--
as
it
may
exercise
this
discretion,
as
a
matter
of
discretion
to
withhold
such
--
such
an
order
until
such
time
this
is
acted
and
the
rest
of
the
industry.
did
i
misunderstand
you
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
offer
--
offer
that
as
an
excuse
or
a
reason,
let
us
say,
for
you're
not
applying
to
the
commission
to
withhold
its
order
until
it
had
gone
through
the
procedure
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
distinction
in
that
arden
case
from
this
one.
i
thought
he
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
they
have
tried
these
cases
in
the
--
that
were
being
--
being
held
awaiting
the
disposition
of
one
--
of
one
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frank
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
any
authorities
in
this
field
which
--
which
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
modify
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
on
a
point
that
was
not
raised
or
could
not
--
or
could
not
have
been
raised
or
that
was
not
raised
before
the
commission
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
mr.
frank
if
in
those
cases
that
you
have
just
cited,
the
--
the
petitioner
did
or
did
not
request
the
commission
to
withhold
its
order.
i
don't
know
myself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kintner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
mr.
kintner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kitner,
may
i
just
--
before
we
get
to
the
next
case.
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
is
there
any
question
in
your
--
your
mind
as
to
whether
the
commission
could
have
withheld
the
order
if
it
had
desires?
do
you
recall
it
that
mr.
frank
said
that
--
that
he
--
he
questioned
whether
they
could
because
of
the
lack
of
equity
powers
but
is
there
any
question
in
your
mind
as
to
whether
they
could
if
they
wanted
to
have
held
this
for
one
year,
two
years
or
until
--
until
it
had
made
certain
other
determinations?
