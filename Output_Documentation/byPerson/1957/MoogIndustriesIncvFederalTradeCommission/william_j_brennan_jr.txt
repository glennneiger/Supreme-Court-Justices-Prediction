dealing
with
the
company
in
the
same
industry
is
in
the
last
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
they
competitors
who
moved
in
niehoff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning,
what,
different
lines
or
different
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it's
different
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
difference
in
product,
not
necessarily
difference
in
custody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
kintner,
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
commission,
the
one
you
referred
us
to
at
1026,
the
refusal
to
stay
in
that
order
is
not
on
any
grounds,
as
i
understand
it,
that
there
was
a
difference
which
requires
the
individualization
of
these
cases.
but
solely,
it
stated
at
least
that
the
commission
orders
would
be
forever
pending
in
an
unlawful
practice
merely
if
it
ever
corrected.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
was
that
in
--
discretion
wasn't
exercised
here
on
any
ground
that
whatever
these
practices
are
under
the
extent
the
practice
by
a
competitors
of
niehoff
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
they
could
not
have
been
reached
in
the
joint
proceeding.
that
was
not
the
ground
of
determination
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
application
for
a
joint
inquiry
was
not
made
when
this
proceeding
started,
but
rather
after
it
has
been
resolved
against
niehoff,
then
niehoff
asked
for
a
stay
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
cease
and
desist
order,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
what
point
was
the
application
made,
to
treat
them
all
at
the
same
time?
at
what
point
in
this
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
on
the
merit
whether
--
whether
or
not
it
was
a
violation
or
on
the
merits
to
the
form
of
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
--
and
the
commission
then
finally
turned
their
determination,
not
on
any
ground
of
dissimilarity
among
competitors
and
between
the
competitors
and
the
niehoff,
but
solely
for
the
ground
stated
here,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
stage
of
the
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
that
the
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
question
argued
orally
before
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
other
grounds
which
mr.
kintner
has
based
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
action
argued
their?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
was
it
suggested
at
all
that
there
were
any
practical
reasons
why
competitors
also,
if
so,
were
so
guilty
of
this
practice,
could
not
have
enjoined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not
suggested
at
any
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission
if
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
one
paragraph.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
--
those
brief
in
oral
argument,
preceded
the
determination
that
you
were
guilty
of
the
violation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
it
was
--
the
commission
has
the
opportunity,
do
i
get
it,
before
handing
down
a
finding
at
all
of
violation
to
have
proceeded
with
these
other
complaints
to
the
same
point
as
yours.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
the
smallest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
smaller
than
that?
one
company
is
smaller
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
did
you
obtain
those
orders?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
they
all
names
of
--
they're
quoted
in
the
16
or
18
to
make
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
industry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
say
that
the
orders
against
them
had
been
sustained
in
the
courts
of
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
do
they
have
to
move
the
compliance?
are
they
still
in
disobedience?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
have
taken
care
of
it
if
this
were
a
dallas
situation
that
we
discuss
this
morning?
in
that
instance,
would
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
reach
the
failure
to
proceed
jointly
against
all
the
offenders
as
the
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
has
but
suppose
it
did
not
moved
against
only
one
of
the
companies
and
then
you
were
brought
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
failure
to
have
moved
against
all
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
to
show
that
at
least
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
but
wouldn't
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
have
to
show
that
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
possibly
was
the
situation
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that.
but
i
say
would
you
not
have
had
to
show
as
the
reason
for
not
having
proceeded
against
them
all
in
that
group
buying
situation
that
there
was
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
are
you
then
claiming
for
the
commission
an
unreviewable
discretion
whether
to
proceed
against
one
or
all
of
a
group
equally
guilty?
