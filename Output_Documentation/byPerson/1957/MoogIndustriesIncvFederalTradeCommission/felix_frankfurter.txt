justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
other
agency
mr.
kintner,
what
other
agencies
would
be
confronted
by
a
cognate
problem
of
a
--
assuming
simplified
uniform
practice
that
they're
assuming,
i'm
putting
to
one
side
the
assumption
to
falsify
that
fact,
to
which
what
other
agency?
i'm
thinking
of
the
--
the
suggestion
you
made,
you'll
hear
your
agencies
like
do
(inaudible)
federal
power
commission
et
cetera.
i
was
wondering
whether
those
agencies
almost
inherent
that
one
can
use
of
dangerous
words
and
each
cases
has
been
individualized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wrote
that
when
i
was
young
and
i
still
believe
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
but
that
--
but
i
think
without
intermitting,
if
one
wants
to
say,
it's
not
reviewable
at
all,
i
think
one
would
phrase
that
the
difference
in
this
case,
well
i
think,
it's
none
of
our
business.
in
any
event
--
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
difference
--
it's
a
very
different
thing
if
you
have
--
simply
a
word
dereliction
where
you
shouldn't
go
back
--
enter
back
to
the
commission
and
say
“you
consider
it
those
rules
are
out
of
hand.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
either
of
these
cases
justify
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
agree
that
the
commission
must
exercise
discretion
and
exercising
discretion
in
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
mr.
sprowl,
may
i
ask
this?
it's
the
record
of
a
thousand
pages,
what
portion
of
that
record
(inaudible)
opinion?
what
portion
of
that
record
to
your
point
of
view
is
relevant
to
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
issue
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you've
got
a
record
of
a
thousand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
this
is
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
treatment
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
i
thought
it
wasn't
visible.
a
thousand
page
is
relevant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sprowl,
am
i
right
to
put
--
i
gather
from
mr.
kintner's
argument
the
diversion
of
this
case
is
that
the
commission
was
entitled
to
have
reasonable
grounds
if
there's
an
expert
party
to
say
that
there
were
such
differences
among
the
competitors
(inaudible)
but
you
couldn't
that
it
was
entitled
to
say
that
they
couldn't
all
be
brought
into
a
single
proceeding.that's
the
burden
of
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
he
said.
now,
if
you
will
address
yourself
to
that
in
particular,
would
you
--
because
if
it's
true,
you
could
hardly
deny
it,
i
suppose
mr.
sprowl,
that
the
commission,
an
agency
must
be
given
discretion
of
the
commission
(inaudible)
and
say
we
can't
bring
them
all
in
one
proceeding,
have
a
counsel
table
over
20
lawyers
and
different
witnesses
(inaudible)
that
it
must
be
successive
--
progressive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
the
filing
of
the
petitioner's
complaint
and
the
order
in
this
case,
how
much
time
is
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
i
gather
--
do
i
gather
that
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
actually
filed
a
complaint
against
the
competitors,
each
taking
successively
four
years
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sprowl,
your
interest
--
in
stating
your
name
(inaudible)
i
think
that's
what
you
call
it.
i
don't
think
the
court
could
respond
and
subscribe
or
rather
underwrite
it
could
subscribe
to
your
thesis
which
i
underwrite
it.
if
i
understood
you,
you
said
that
the
commission
should
have
had
a
general
investigation
and
form
itself
as
it
were
regarding
all
the
particularities
(inaudible)
that
you
have
this
interest
and
it
has
done
in
other
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
surely,
we
can't
possibly
remotely
suggest
there
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sprowl,
16
or
17
as
you
see
it,
the
commission
would
issue
a
complaint
against
the
16
or
17,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
bring
them
in
as
you
see
it,
making
it
(inaudible),
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
the
commission
to
get
the
kind
of
prima
facie
order,
presumptive
illegality
against
which
there
would
be
individualize
defenses.
you
said
they
would
--
it
wouldn't
take
the
court
--
it
wouldn't
ask
the
court
to
hold
up
enforcement
against
you
until
everyone
of
the
17
respondents
or
whatever
they're
called
before
the
commission,
make
their
individual
defenses,
a
generalize
order
which
would
take
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
from
your
point
--
just
on
experience
on
these
matters,
how
long
do
you
think
before
the
commission
could
administratively
sure
an
order
that
would
take
care
of
the
unfairness
that
you
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
that
estimate,
you
include
that
the
commission
has
a
lot
of
things
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
individualize
the
term
that's
then
left
under
the
cease
and
desist
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
that
mr.
sprowl
(inaudible).
he
then
say,
“oh,
i've
done
nothing
illegal
because
i
was
merely
(inaudible)
my
illegality
between
another
illegality.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
but
he
lost
that
defense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
--
is
his
lost
going
to
be
a
victory
if
you
were
to
order
the
illegality
against
the
competitors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
sophisticated
for
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
exposed
that
(inaudible)
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
if
you
bring
the
law
under
the
heel
of
the
law,
they'd
all
scot-free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
because
what
was
the
illegal
shall
become
legal
by
modification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
a
cease
and
desist
order
is
right
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
that
means,
has
no
equity
jurisdiction?does
that
mean
that
the
commission
would
itself
be
powerless
to
enter
or
to
qualify
a
order
of
finding
illegality
with
such
a
qualification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
hold
up
in
the
elizabeth
arden
case,
that's
not
a
bad
target
i
suppose.
if
they
hold
up
the
enforcement
of
the
order
against
elizabeth
arden
until
they
get
through
with
the
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
different
questions
at
least
to
my
mind.
one,
if
the
--
if
the
federal
trade
commission
has
empower,
has
not
the
power,
i'm
not
talking
about
--
of
course
you're
having
that
equity
jurisdiction
in
any
sense
because
they're
not
at
court.
i
don't
know
all
that
talking
is
next
to
nothing
and
got
equity
jurisdiction
because
they
haven't
got
any
jurisdiction
in
a
judicial
sense.
but
if
the
federal
trade
commission
itself
has
no
power
which
would
surprise
me
and
i'm
subject
to
correction
(inaudible),
if
they
haven't
got
power
to
stay
an
order
after
they
find
illegality,
an
order
out
of
fairness
to
treat
competitors
in
the
same
condition,
the
same
way.
and
there's
one
question
whether
the
court
has
power
to
qualify
an
order
which
the
commission
itself
has
no
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
commission
--
if
the
commission
has
power
but
doesn't
exercise
it,
that
raises
a
totally
different
question
what
the
discretionary
authority
of
the
court
is
to
hit
into
or
qualify
a
discretion
exercise
in
a
particular
way
by
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
are
very
different
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
your
doubt
so
fast
it
is
that
you
felt
inhibited
from
asking
the
commission
to
--
to
exercise
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
well,
the
counsel
then.
do
you
think
anybody
--
i
--
i
approved
highly,
the
lawyer
is
not
raising
foolish
points
but
since
they
have
that
power
it
wasn't
raised,
if
it
was
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this?
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
some
statute
(inaudible)
say
specifically,
some
of
this
regulatory
statute
say
specifically
you
can't
raise
a
point
before
the
court
that
wasn't
raised
before
the
agency
that's
a
little
of
the
federal
power
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
one
does
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
it
isn't
--
that
impliedly
that
is
a
legal
point.
i
just
want
to
know
whether
the
statute
tells
that
specifically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
chief
justice's
point
-
question,
namely,
whether
a
--
a
question
raise
above
before
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
raised
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
arden,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
frank,
lawyers
can
try
two
lawsuits
at
the
same
time
if
he's
skillful
enough.
so
i
can
see
that
you
don't
have
to
choose
between
two
positions,
but
do
you
take
either
or
both
namely
that
the
power
--
that
the
trade
commission
has
not
the
power
to
stay
it's
order
and
that
relief
for
that
must
be
had
from
the
court
or
you
say
alternatively,
if
it
has
the
power
and
doesn't
exercise
it.
it's
such
an
abusive
discretion
that
the
court
can
rectify
that
abuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
take
some
other
position
still?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it's
your
position
that
to
enforce
an
order
to
stay,
to
cease
and
desist
a
violation
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
against
a
particular
business
would
be
so
inequitable
if
the
same
order
conceded
is
--
the
same
order
violated
by
competitors
of
the
petitioner
and
not
also
ordered
to
be
stay
just
to
be
ceased
and
desisted,
so
inequitable
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
--
which
has
the
reviewing
power
of
such
an
order
or
as
an
exercise
of
its
inherent
or
granted
equity
powers
grant
such
a
stay,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
frank,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
request
--
a
request
for
a
stay
of
the
enforcement
of
an
order
against
competitor
one
until
competitors
--
the
rest
of
them
dealt
with,
were
made
before
the
commission.
and
suppose
the
commission
considered
it
and
after
hearing
arguments
pro
and
con,
decided
against
such
a
stay.
but
it's
considered
and
gave
reason
for
denying.
i
can
think
of
administrative
process
and
so
on
and
so
on,
would
that
be
a
different
--
would
that
present
a
different
case
than
where
as
in
the
niehoff
case,
a
request
is
made
and
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
makes
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
--
pardon
me
because
i
thought
you
agree
that
the
commission
could
state
an
order
of
invalidity,
didn't
you
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
they
must
always
grant
a
stay
if
there
are
competitors
in
the
field
according
to
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
not
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
--
i'm
sorry,
the
commission
had
done
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
--
could
such
--
such
an
inquiry
or
could
such
complaints
be
considered
in
a
single
proceeding
to
where
the
i.c.c.often
brings
before
it
the
vast
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
impliedly
by
that
answer
did
not
deny
the
suggestion
or
the
claim
that
in
fact
there
was
uniform
trade
practice
here
which
governed
all
those
in
it.
you
deny
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
as
to
those
--
as
to
practices
that
were
uniformly
though
not
all
the
practices
that
you
might
look
into,
but
as
to
practices
where
there
was
uniformity
in
the
industry,
does
the
commission
or
the
commission
enable
to
bring
the
whole
industry
before
it
and
order
--
one
fell
order
to
outlaw
in
such
a
uniform
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me
why
as
to
the
admission
that
you've
made.
i
mean
the
statement
you
made
a
minute
ago.
there
were
certain
practices
that
were
uniformed.
what
is
the
--
what
are
the
administrative
pampering
that
this
does
that
prevent
those
practices
from
being
dealt
with
in
--
in
a
comprehensive,
in
an
all
industry
comprehending
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
what
--
on
what
basis
did
you
say
that
mr.
frank's
statement
was
true
as
to
some
practices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
establishment
of
that
uniform
practice
require
individualized,
complicated
inquiry
as
to
each
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
there
you
could
have
a
single
--
i'm
not
saying
that
makes
a
difference.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
administrative
problems
are
which
may
make
a
difference
in
what
courts
do
or
allowed
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
--
this
is
what
i
gathered
from
what
you've
said
that
although
it
may
appear
on
a
surface,
on
a
façade
view
that
there
is
a
uniform
practice
in
an
industry
concerning
so
many
--
anywhere
from
two
or
more
many
competitors,
although
it
may
appear
there
is
a
single
uniformed
industry
wide
practice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
apparently
single
uniformed
practice
is
so
individualized
that
you
cannot
do
it
otherwise
in
case
by
case.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
--
did
the
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
order
in
the
moog
case,
in
this
case,
start
by
some
private
complaint
or
on
the
commission's
initiation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
not
take
that
thing
--
could
the
whole
--
all
those
who
are
pursuing
that
practice
could
they
not
be
brought
into
a
single
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
who
did
--
those
who
did.
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
drawing
the
legal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
get
understanding
of
what
the
administrative
does
and
why
does
it
and
what
it
has
to
do
and
what
it
does
not
have
to
do
for
effective
administration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
from
what
you
said
that
any
of
that
would
be
irrelevant
to
a
situation
where
as
a
matter
of
bookkeeping,
a
fellow
gets
the
discount
because
he
belongs
to
a
buying
group
and
the
other
fellow
who
doesn't
stands
out
against
the
buying
group
doesn't
get
the
discount.
what
is
that
--
what
kind
of
a
defense
the
difference
in
cost
be
if
that's
the
reason
of
the
differential?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.--
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
kintner.
apart
from
the
elizabeth
arden
case,
does
the
commission
sometimes
stay
its
order
to
cease
and
desist?
and
if
so,
on
what
ground
does
it
stay
if
--
if
they
are
capable
of
generalization?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
worked
out
administratively.
i
mean
that
--
the
process
which
you've
just
outlined
has
been
evolved
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
the
help
of
the
commission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
at
--
if
i'm
mistaken
i
thought
of
the
opinion
here,
almost
in
every
criminal
--
is
also
enough
from
defense
lawyers.
why
don't
they
bring
in
bigger
picture
that
this
court
(inaudible)
for
you
gentlemen
at
the
jury.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
thing
to
say,
you
shouldn't
prosecute
a,
because
he
also
keeps
me
from
saying
that
in
the
domain
of
commercial
regulation,
where
if
it
would
be
true,
there's
a
big
“if”.
if
a,
b
and
c
are
competitors,
serious
competitors
and
they're
all
engaged
(inaudible)
conscious
parallelism,
if
he
can
bring
all
the
men
and
have
a
trade
wise
or
a
proportionately
trade-wise
order
if
that
can
be
done
certainly
it
would
be
a
decent
administration.
it
would
be
fair
to
do
that
and
i'm
yet
--
i'm
still
trying
to
see
why
as
you
put
it
before
the
recess
that
there
aren't
such
situation
such
as
the
(inaudible)
club
where
you
can
--
where
you
can
bring
them
all
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
mean
in
this
case,
you've
given
your
discretion,
the
consideration
to
holding
it
up
but
you
decide
not
to
hold
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
concede
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
overturn
that
as
it
found
abuse
in
your
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
given
--
what
you've
said
that
those
bulk
of
your
argument
is
for
me
at
least,
a
conclusive
answer,
namely,
you
deny
identity
of
considerations
in
the
various
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
for
me
is
a
conclusive
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
take
care
of
the
whole
business?
of
course
if
a,
b,
and
c
have
different
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kintner,
if
i
understood
justice
brennan's
question.
if
i
understood
or
to
your
reply
--
i
--
is
not
answered
so
far
as
my
understanding
of
question
and
answer
(inaudible).
as
i
understood
his
question,
it
was
--
assume
the
dallas
situation,
and
that
i
was
saying
this
is
--
you've
indicated.
assume
the
dallas
situation
four
or
five
three
or
six,
i
don't
care
which,
a
multiple
number
of
records,
multiple
number
who
violated
an
act
which
doesn't
call
for
any
cost
to
counter
anything
concededly,
the
difference
between
those
who
belong
to
buyers
group
and
those
who
do
not.
a
motion
is
made
and
the
commission
does
only
after
one.
a
motion
is
made
to
stay
its
order
until
it
enters
a
civil
order
against
the
other.
i
understand
your
order
and
of
course
if
i
hear
it
correctly
that
if
the
commission
doesn't
pass
on
that
motion,
we
will
consider
this
for
or
if
it
sends
it
out
and
puts
it
on
file,
you
can
get
mandamus
just
as
you
can
get
mandamus
against
the
i.c.c.
or
any
other
administrative
agency
to
exercise
its
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
about
that.
but
when
--
from
there,
you
went
on
and
saying
if
it
does,
that
it
exercise
discretion,
period.
as
i
understood
justice
brennan's
question,
that's
why
i
like
to
associate
myself
with
it.
assuming
that
simple
situation
uncomplicated
by
individualization
of
cost
and
all
of
the
rest
and
the
commission
exercised
its
discretion
against
to
stay
in
favor
of
one
who
belongs
to
a
concededly
group
class,
is
that
not
such
an
--
such
an
exercise
of
its
discretion
as
to
constitute
an
abuse
correctable
by
the
court
of
appeals?
and
your
answer
is
no
to
that
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
does
not
go
that
far
to
be--
to
be
correctable
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
when
you
say
“dereliction”
that's
a
big
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
say
that,
the
court
of
appeals,
under
the
authority
given
by
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
can't
correct
a
dereliction.
that
seems
to
be
rather
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
at
all.
i'm
not
--
i
wasn't
out
of
hand
to
say
that
congress
can
withhold
all
judicial
review.
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
it
couldn't
that
it's
a
very
different
thing
when
it
gives
the
review
its
power
--
power
to
modify
and
something
occurs
that
is
deserving
to
be
characterized
or
you
characterize
as
a
dereliction
but
that
is
not
for
me
to
believe
the
court
of
appeals.
