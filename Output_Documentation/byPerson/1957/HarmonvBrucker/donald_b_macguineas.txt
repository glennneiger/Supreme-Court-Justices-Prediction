mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
my
argument
in
the
prior
course
--
case,
as
to
what
congress
intended
by
way
of
review
of
the
character
of
discharge
given
a
particular
soldier.
i
should
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
directing
attention
to
the
legislative
reorganization
act
of
1946
which
seems
to
us
most
significant
in
that
respect.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
record
discloses
only
charges
relating
to
overt
acts
or
association
in
a
preinduction
period.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it's
certainly
all
that
the
government
--
the
department
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
relied
on.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
that
there's
any
other
consideration
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--involved.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
now,
i
was
--
i
was
calling
your
attention
to
the
le
--
legislative
reorganization
act
of
1946.
and
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
congress.
and
to
that
end,
it
prohibited
the
introduction
of
private
bills
on
three
subjects
(1)
court
claims,
(2)
applications
to
build
bridges
over
navigable
streams,
and
(3)
for
the
correction
of
military
records.
now
significantly,
with
respect
to
tort
claims,
at
the
same
act,
congress
established
first,
with
respect
the
claims
up
to
$1000,
a
system
of
administrative
authority
to
settle
claims
but
those
claims
as
well
as
all
claims
over
$1000
were
given
an
explicit
judicial
remedy
by
a
suit
de
novo
in
the
district
courts
by
contrast
with
respect
to
the
other
two
types
of
subject
matters
to
which
private
bills
were
prohibited.
the
only
remedy
granted
with
respect
to
applications
to
build
bridges
is,
that
you
must
obtain
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
war,
in
other
words,
congress
turned
the
whole
subject
matter
of
building
bridges
over
to
the
secretary
of
war.
and
with
respect
to
the
correction
of
military
records,
congress
then
established
the
boards
for
the
correction
of
the
military
records
and
turned
over
to
those
boards
the
claims
for
the
correction
of
military
records.
now,
in
--
in
one
instance,
congress
creates
a
judicial
remedy
explicitly
and
in
the
other
two
instances,
creates
explicit
administrative
remedies
with
no
provision
for
judicial
review.
that
seems
to
us,
highly
significant
of
the
intention
of
congress.
and
furthermore,
we
think
that
our
position
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
prior
to
1944,
when
the
army
discharge
review
boards,
service
discharge
review
boards
were
established.
the
only
remedy
by
which
a
soldier's
discharge
certificate
could
be
changed,
assuming
that
the
secretary
himself
was
unwilling
to
do
so,
was
by
private
act
of
congress
for
generations.
congress
had
been
passing
private
acts
on
application
of
this
order
to
do
so.
so
that
also
seems
to
us,
to
indicate,
that
congress
felt
that
the
tribunal,
the
place
to
go
for
that
was
not
to
the
courts
but
--
after
exhaustion
of
your
remedy
before
the
department,
to
go
to
congress
itself,
certainly,
if
it
had
been
felt
that
the
courts
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
applications,
congress
would
not
have
troubled
itself
to
pass
these
private
bills
granting
that
relief
on
a
piecemeal
basis.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
my
--
i
cannot
cite
you
a
specific
statute.
my
understanding
is
that
they
were.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
you
mean?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
let
us
assume
a
case
of
a
man
who
is
inducted
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
from
the
army's
standpoint,
the
--
the
one
in
important
consideration
is
that
the
honorable
discharge
is
always
been
treated
as
a
kind
of
a
--
a
badge
of
merit,
a
certificate
that
you've
done
of
finding
job.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
think,
it's
the
purpose
of
both.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
give
him
a
--
give
him
an
accolade,
as
i
said
before.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
a
letter
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
a
letter
--
no.
no.
but
when
the
army
says,
we
think
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
it's
unsuitable
to
have
this
man
in
the
service.
it
considers
that
it
may
draw
a
distinction
between
that
man
and
the
other
man
that
serves
full
term
and
has
rendered
valuable
service
to
the
army.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
he
might
get
--
he
might
get
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
if
--
if
your
honor's
question
is,
“is
there
authority
in
the
army
to
judge
a
man
solely
on
a
preinduction
act
which
has
no
relation
to
anything
to
his
being
in
the
army?”
i
would
say,
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
if
that's
the
question
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
that's
my
answer.
but
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
let's
assume
your
--
your
own
example.
a
man,
after
he
gets
in,
has
been
found
or
concluded
by
the
army
to
have
committed
actual
acts
of
espionage
or
treason
and
the
army
says,
“well,
we
don't
want
this
man
in
the
army.”
does
it
--
is
it
precluded
from
making
any
distinction
between
that
man
and
the
man
who
goes
through
a
full
term
service
and
does
a
fine
job?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
should
think
so.
the
statute
requires
that
--
that
a
man
shall
be
discharged
but
i
don't
think
that
needed
to
be
construed,
to
mean,
that
he
has
to
be
given
the
particular
piece
of
paper
which
is
he
is
now
given
in
the
present
form.
and
indeed
in
connection
with
petitioner
in
this
case,
when
he
was
separated
from
active
service,
he
completed
his
term
of
active
service,
he
was
not
given
the
regular
discharge
certificate.
he
was
given
this
form,
dd214,
a
report
of
separation
which
indicated
that
he
was
separated
honorably
and
i
do
--
i
think
that
that's
certainly
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
could
the
--
could
the
secretary
of
the
army
promulgate
a
regulation
to
that
effect,
i
would
think
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,
the
president.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i'm
sorry.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
would
think
he
could
unless
you
are
to
construe
the
statute
which
talks
about
discharge
as
meaning
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
i
would
not
so
construe
the
statute.
now,
may
i
also
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
would
think
not.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
distinction
that
the
army
makes
with
respect
to
this
--
this
security
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
they
do
not
want
a
man
whom
they
considered
to
be
a
security
risk
in
the
armed
forces.
and
therefore,
they
want
to
get
rid
of
it.
and
therefore,
the
question
--
and
petitioner
concedes
--
and
that,
i
should
like
to
reiterate.
petitioner
concedes
that
the
army
may
do
that
on
that
ground.
and
the
only
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
the
only
question
is,
may
they
issue
to
him
a
piece
of
paper
which
accurately
reflects
the
ground
on
which
they
did
it.
now,
may
i
--
since
my
time
is
rather
short
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
putting
those
terms,
i
would
not
think
that
the
army
could
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
our
petition
is
this.
the
army
may
dismiss
any
man
whom
it
deems
to
be
a
security
risk.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
they
can
concede
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
they
do.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
now
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
if
the
army
is
to
formulate
a
conclusion
that
john
jones
is
a
security
risk
wholly
on
the
basis
of
what
he
did
before
he
went
into
the
service,
we
do
not
support
the
army's
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
i
said
the
army
is
entitled
to
dismiss
any
man
as
a
security
risk.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
if
the
army
forms
that
conclusion
solely
on
the
basis
of
preinduction
activities
that
has
nothing
--
nothing
to
do
with
what
he
did
when
he
was
in
the
service
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
that
we
do
not
support
the
authority
of
the
army
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
your
honor,
by
no
means.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
what
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
is
not
at
all
the
question
as
to
whether
that
is
an
issue
properly
before
the
district
court
which
is
of
course
our
basic
position
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
if
--
if
i
--
if
the
court
--
let
me
put
it
in
this
way
if
i
may.
i
don't
want
not
to
be
answering
your
honor
directly.
our
position
is
first
that
congress
has
not
invested
the
district
courts
with
the
function
of
reviewing
the
basis
for
a
military
discharge
or
the
character
of
the
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
our
second
position
is
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
petitioner,
there
is
not
a
legal
injury.
there
is
no
justiciable
controversy
which
would
enable
him
to
--
properly
to
maintain
an
action
in
the
courts.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
then
we
would
say,
certainly,
that
the
courts
even
there
--
it's
assuming
some
degree
of
reviewability
will
not
go
beyond
determining
whether
the
army
acted
within
its
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
it
--
the
man
was
in
the
service
and
was
subject
to
dismissal
and
secondly,
that
he
was
dismissed
by
a
board
which
was
authorized
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
if
the
court
is
going
to
say
that
it
can't
review
any
discharge
ever
given
to
a
soldier
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
what
--
it
seems
to
me
that,
really,
that's
what
the
position
the
court
has
to
come
to
if
it
disagrees
with
all
of
our
other
legal
positions,
that
the
court,
the
district
court
is
free
to
review
any
discharge
given
to
any
soldier
which
is
not
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
if
--
if
that
is
so,
then,
as
i
say,
we
would
not
support
the
specific
action
of
the
secretary
in
this
particular
case
on
this
set
of
facts.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
army.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
has.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
this
case
presents
most
important
questions
as
to
reviewability
by
the
civil
courts
of
military
discharges,
very
important
questions.
and
may
i
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
reason
--
primarily,
the
reason
that
the
regulations
were
not
set
forth
more
extensively
in
our
brief
was
that
the
petitioners,
both
petitioners,
concede
that
there
was
a
compliance
with
regulations.
so,
there
was
no
issue
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
regulations
were
complied
with.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
to
this
issue.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
hope
your
honor
is
not
suggesting
that
i
have
evaded
any
questions
along
that
line.
i've
been
trying
to
spend
as
much
time
as
i
can
to
argue
the
positions
which
we
do
assert.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
we
make
no
distinction
in
that
respect
between
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
there
is
the
secondary
question
in
both
cases
that
on
the
facts
of
these
cases,
have
these
petitioners
demonstrated
a
type
of
legal
injury
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
which
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
justiciable
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
we
do
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
do
show
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
in
connection
with
the
discussion
of
those
issues,
we
show
in
our
brief,
and
i
regret
my
time
for
argument
will
not
permit
me
to
show,
that
what
in
the
first
place,
that
there
is
not
here
any
basis
for
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
confer
untrammeled
discretion
on
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
decide
the
type
of
discharge
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
we
think
plainly
a
statute
which
says
that
a
man
shall
only
be
discharged
in
accordance
with
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
think
that
the
statute
does
confer
on
the
secretary
of
the
army
the
untrammeled
discretion
to
decide
the
type
of
discharge
to
be
given
to
a
particular
man
as
a
matter
of
statutory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,
i
did
say
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
now,
may
i
--
at
a
few
moments
of
my
--
remaining
to
me,
call
to
the
courts
attention
in
connection
with
the
counsel's
argument
that
he
thinks
that
the
applicable
statute
here
which
is
the
armed
forces
reserve
act
of
1952
did
not
contemplate
a
discharge
for
security
considerations.
and
we
set
forth
on
our
brief,
at
the
beginning
of
page
28,
statements
from
the
legislative
history
which
shows
explicitly
that
the
bill
originally
contained
a
provision
that
a
discharge,
less
than
an
honorable
discharge
could
be
given
for
security
reasons
without
a
hearing,
if
the
interest
of
the
government
require.
and
that
furthermore,
there
was
at
one
stage
a
provision
in
the
bill
to
the
effect
that
a
discharge
specifically
could
be
discharged
for
security
reasons.
that
specific
statement
was
in
the
bill.
so,
there's
no
question
that
congress
was
aware
that
this
statute,
the
applicable
one
to
petitioner
in
this
case,
would
be
used
or
might
be
used
by
the
secretary
of
the
army
to
discharge
a
man
because
he
deemed
him
a
security
risk.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
we
will
do
that
in
the
supplemental
memorandum
which
we
have
indicated
that
we
will
submit.
now,
if
i
may
turn
a
moment
to
our
other
question
of
justiciability.
what
i
say
will
specifically
deal
with
abramowitz
but
it
applies
a
fortiori
to
harmon.
abramowitz
has
the
honorable
separation
from
active
service.
that
gives
him
all
federal
benefits.
he
is
not
deprived
of
any
right
to
veteran's
pensions
or
hospitalization
or
anything
else
that
a
veteran
gets
and
of
course,
it's
also
true
beyond
question
that
harmon
gets
all
federal
benefits
by
virtue
of
his
general
discharge.
so,
petitioners
are
driven
back
to
resort
to
a
denial,
alleged
denial
of
benefits
under
the
new
york
statutes
where
they
reside.
in
the
first
place,
they
do
not
correctly
cite
the
statutes.
no
new
york
statute
uses
the
words
“honorable
discharge.”
it
speaks
of
honorably
discharge
soldiers
and
i
have
and
we're
allowed
with
the
court,
verbatim
copies
of
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
explicitly
construing
one
of
those
statutes
and
saying
that
as
long
as
the
soldier
does
have
a
dishonorable
discharge,
he
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
new
york
veteran
statute.
in
other
words,
the
opinion
recognizes
the
distinction
in
terms
between
an
honorable
discharge
and
a
general
discharge.
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
says,
“it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
whichever
one
he
has
is
sufficient
for
purposes
of
new
york
benefits.”
and
--
so
that
even
quite
apart
from
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
any
likelihood
that
these
petitioners
would
ever
apply
for
those
benefits
or
if
so,
that
they
would
be
denied.
and
the
fact
is,
we
have
an
authoritative
ruling
by
the
new
york
authorities
that
they
are
eligible.
the
only
other
question
on
which
petitions
rely
for
justiciability
is
the
so-called
question
of
stigma.
they
equate
a
decision
by
determination
that
a
soldier
is
a
security
risk
with
the
comments
made
by
this
court
in
joint
anti-fascist
and
peters
v.hobby
that
a
stigma
attaches
to
a
characterization
of
disloyalty.
we
think
that
is
stretching
those
cases
beyond
reason
and
all
of
those
cases
significantly,
with
one
exception,
that's
joint
anti-fascist,
every
one
of
those
cases
depended
for
its
justiciability
not
upon
any
question
of
stigma.
they
were
questions
of
employees
who
had
actually
been
discharged,
allegedly
contrary
to
the
law
or
statute
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
always
said,
there
is
district
court
justiciability
of
that
kind
of
case
or
some
of
them
are
even
criminal
content
convictions
like
the
watkins
case.
of
course,
there's
no
question
of
justiciablity.
now,
the
one
case
which
is
not
fit
in
that
mode
is
joint
anti-fascist.
and
there,
justiciability
was
rested
on
the
fact
that
what
was
on
the
pleadings
necessarily
construed
by
this
court
as
an
unauthorized
and
an
arbitrary
public
designation
by
the
attorney
general
of
an
organization,
as
a
communist
organization,
was
defamatory
and
that
that
kind
of
defamation
gave
justiciablity.
now,
in
the
first
place,
that
counsel
made
some
comments
about
this
being
--
this
certificates
being
a
public
document.
they
are
not
a
public
document.
the
fact
is,
that
under
army
regulations,
if
a
man
writes
to
the
army
and
says,
”i
want
to
hire
john
jones,”
what
kind
of
a
discharge
certificate
did
he
get
or
what
kind
of
a
report
of
separation?
the
army
will
not
give
that
information.
that
information
is
given
only
to
the
soldier
himself
so
that
it's
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
that
maybe
but
the
point
is
the
publication,
if
there
be
any,
is
by
the
soldier
and
not
by
the
government.
so
that
scarcely
can
be
defamation
when
the
publication
is
not
by
the
alleged
defamer.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
give
it
to
him
for
whatever
purpose
he
wishes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
i
think
that's
a
very
vital
distinction
even
in
an
ordinary
slanderous
case
--
case.
suppose
i
write
a
slanderous
letter
to
x
but
i
just
show
it
to
x
and
nobody
else
and
x
chooses
to
publish
it
to
the
world
or
to
show
it
to
his
employer.
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
of
defamation
against
me
because
i
made
no
publication.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
think,
it
is
a
private
document
in
the
sense
that
it
isn't
--
it's
certainly
not
a
public
document.
the
public
is
not
entitled
to
know
it
and
will
not
be
given
it.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
not
within
the
scope
of
any
decision
that
this
court
has
rendered
even
in
this
field.
and
i
don't
--
and
i
shouldn't
say
this
field,
but
even
in
the
loyalty
field
which
is
certainly
much
more
stigmatic
than
what
we
have
here
because
after
all,
security
risk
doesn't
mean
that
a
man
is
disloyal,
it
means
that
the
army
does
not
choose
to
rely
upon
him,
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
or
whatever.
so
we
think
that
there
is
here
a
very
substantial
question
of
common
law
justiciability
which,
to
us,
should
prevent
the
court
from
reaching
any
of
the
contentions
advanced
by
the
petitioners.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,
yes
i
--
i'm
generally
familiar
with
that
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
would
assume
not
but
that
didn't
--
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
go
to
my
point
of
justiciability.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
as
far
as
the
new
york
benefits
are
concerned
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
it's
--
it's
clear
that
as
to
abramowitz,
he
is
entitled
to
federal
benefits
because
he
did
perform
his
active
service
satisfactorily
and
that's
what
counts
as
far
as
federal
benefits
are
concerned.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
in
this
petitioner,
it
is
my
belief,
could
get
his
job
back
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
because
he
can
rely
on
his
first
discharge
from
active
service
which
was
honorable,
and
that
is
not
their
benefit
if
not
taken
away
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
certainly.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
surely.
and
it's
the
first
one,
the
discharge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
from
two
different
capacities.
there's
no
inconsistency
because
they're
discharges
from
two
different
capacities
in
the
military
establishment.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
we
think
most
so
because
we
are
unable
to
read
petitioner's
contentions
in
any
like
other
than
saying
that
really,
although
he
doesn't
put
it
this
baldly,
that
really
the
civil
courts
are
entitled
to
pass.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
well,
that's
what's
most
important
to
the
government.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
solicitor
general
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
took
the
position
that
he
would
not
advance
to
this
court
a
contention
that
that
was
a
proper
and
reasonable
thing
for
the
solicitor
general
to
do.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
cannot
say
as
to
that
question.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
but
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
may
still
submit
the
supplemental
memorandum
discussed
in
the
prior
case
in
which
we
will
give
the
court
copies
of
regulations
which
are
not
set
forth
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
with
the
record.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
be
glad
to
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i'm
sure
that
--
that
communication
will
come
into
other
channels
but
it
would
come
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i'm
an
attorney
in
the
civil
division
which
handles
these
cases
in
both
the
lower
court.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
this
--
this
type
of
cases
generally
and
these
particular
cases
and
was
assigned
this
case
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
yes.
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
the
solicitor
general
said
that
if
that
question
was
raised
by
the
court,
if
the
court
deemed
that
material,
i
was
to
state
fairly
and
honestly
the
solicitor
general's
position
which
i
have
done
to
the
best
of
my
ability.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
appreciate
your
expression
of
confidence.
you
might
understand
--
