mr.
donald
b.
macguines
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
ask
the
court
to
turn
again
to
page
112
of
the
record,
which
is
the
photostatic
copy
of
the
actual
discharge
certificate
received
by
the
petitioner.
this
is
the
document
which
is
stated
to
impose
such
horrendous
consequences
upon
petitioner
that
it
violates
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
but
that
is
an
alternative
contention
which
he
makes,
i
believe.
now,
the
only
difference
in
form
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
oh,
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
only
difference
in
form
and
content
between
this
general
discharge
certificate
which
petitioner
holds
and
the
honorable
discharge
certificate
which
he
asked
this
court
to
compel
the
secretary
of
the
army
issue
to
him
is
the
heading,
first,
instead
of
the
large
type
general
discharge
would
be
the
words
"honorable
discharge."
and
then
there
is
an
additional
statement
in
the
honorable
discharge
certificate
that
it
is
awarded
as
a
testimonial
of
honest
and
faithful
service.
now,
that
testimonial
is
omitted
from
the
general
discharge
certificate
and
that
is
the
only
distinction
in
the
two
types
of
certificates
upon
which
petitioner
bases
his
whole
case.
now,
to
clarify
the
statements
of
petitioner's
counsel
with
respect
to
the
report
of
separation
form,
the
dd
214,
the
original
of
that
form
is
the
official
army
record
maintained
in
the
war
department,
the
official
record
of
the
soldier's
service.
it
is
a
copy
of
that
record
which
is
given
to
the
soldier
as
well
as
the
formal
discharge
certificate.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
as
i
understand
it,
they
are
separate
documents.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
they're
--
they're
merely
printed.
that's
merely
the
way
the
printer
chose
to
print
it
in
the
record.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
completely
separate
documents.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
difference
is,
both
are
given
under
honorable
conditions,
they
represent
that
the
solider
has
served
under
honorable
conditions.
but
the
honorable
discharge
certificate
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
the
--
the
official
phrase
in
the
army
regulations
is
served
under
honorable
conditions
and
that
i
take
it
means
honorably
whether
the
discharge
is
the
honorable
discharge
or
the
general
under
honorable
conditions.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
they
say
he
served
under
honorable
conditions.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
certificate.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
surely.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
precisely.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
distinction
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
they
--
legally,
they
mean
the
same
thing
as
i
hope
to
develop
at
length
in
the
argument.
the
honorable
discharge
is
an
accolade,
if
i
may
say
so,
a
highest
type
of
letter
of
recommendation.
the
general
discharge,
while
it
says
the
man
has
served
under
honorable
conditions,
does
not
get
in
that
extra
accolade
and
that's
the
only
non-legal
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
--
the
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
as
such
was
introduced
into
the
army
regulations
in
1921.
the
history
of
that
is
set
forth
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
it's
in
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
honorable
discharge?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
i
think
that
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
our
military
organization.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
we
had
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
a
compilation
of
the
number
of
discharges
given
over
the
last
several
years
by
the
army
and
the
air
force.
discharges
other
than
the
honorable
discharge.
and
as
the
court
can
see
that
runs
up
to
from
20,
25,
30,
up
to
40,000
per
year.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that's
page
38
of
our
main
brief,
your
honor.
the
table
there
--
for
instance,
the
--
the
highest
number
shown
is
for
the
year
1954
when
some
39,000
were
given.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
now
of
course,
it
must
be
understood
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
discharge
under
honorable
condition
as
we've
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
we
merely
have
to
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
i
think
it
might
have
been
more
artistic
if
it
had
said,
number
awarded
a
discharge
other
than
the
honorable
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
that's
the
--
i
think
we
did.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
no.
this
is
a
--
this
is
purely
a
tabulation
which
we
prepared
from
army
statistics
and
air
force
statistics
prepared
by
us.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
think
it
might
have
been
phrased
more
artistically
to
say
other
than
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
the
--
the
figures
are
given
in
this
table
on
page
38.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that's
a
rough
approximation.
i
would
think
that
is
true.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
am
sorry.
neither
the
record
nor
the
briefs
contain
that
information.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
the
court
knows
that
there
is
substantial
number
of
court-martials
every
year.
what
that
number
amounts
to,
i'm
just
not
in
a
position
to
say.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
in
terms
of
the
overall
total
of
discharges,
it
certainly
is.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
will
you
honor
permit
me
to
lead
up
that
to
that
answer?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
thank
you.
as
we
read
175
years
of
legislative
practice
in
this
country
running
back
to
before
the
revolution,
congress
has
never
intended
to
vest
in
the
civil
courts
discretion
to
decide
what
types
of
discharges
shall
be
prescribed
by
the
armed
forces,
that
is
to
say
what
categories
of
discharges,
nor
has
it
attempted
to
vest
the
courts
with
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
established
form
of
certificates
shall
be
given
to
a
particular
soldier
under
any
particular
circumstances.
the
british
articles
of
war
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
required
that
a
soldier
be
given
a
discharge.they
did
not
specify
honorable
or
dishonorable
or
other
types
of
discharge.
that
has
been
carried
forward
through
the
continental
congress
in
the
articles
of
war
and
after
the
constitution
was
adopted
through
the
early
congresses
in
the
articles
of
war
and
it
has
been
carried
forward
to
date.
specifically,
the
statute
which
is
applicable
to
petitioner's
discharge
is
an
act
of
1920
which
provides
that
no
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that
may
be
found
at
the
back
of
our
main
brief,
your
honor,
at
page
78,
paragraph
number
two.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
this
is
the
basic
statute
under
which
the
discharge
was
given
to
petitioner.
and
the
court
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
i
will
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
will
in
a
moment
refer
to
one
other
subsequent
statute.
but
the
court
will
observe
that
under
that
statute,
first,
every
enlisted
man
must,
upon
his
discharge,
be
given
a
certificate
of
discharge.
and
secondly,
that
no
enlisted
man
shall
be
discharged
prior
to
expiration
of
his
term
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
the
army
or
by
court-martial.
note
again
that
congress,
even
to
this
date,
has
never
specified
whether
there
shall
be
honorable
discharges,
general
discharges,
undesirable
discharges
or
so
forth,
nor
has
it
ever
set
forth
the
conditions
under
which
the
man
receives
one
type
of
discharge
rather
than
another.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
and
that
is
my
point,
that
congress
has
left
in
the
military
establishments,
the
full
discretion
to
prescribe
by
regulation,
what
types
discharge
that
shall
be
and
under
what
circumstances
a
particular
type
shall
be
given
to
a
particular
soldier.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
your
honor.
so
this
statute
has
direct
application
to
petitioner.
now,
the
only
other
statute
which
has
direct
application
to
petitioner
is
--
is
the
following
paragraph
on
page
78
of
our
brief.
the
universal
military
training
and
service
act.
and
--
and
when
that
act
was
enacted,
there
was
the
secretary
of
defense,
super
imposed
upon
the
three
military
establishments.
so
it
provides
that
no
soldier
shall
be
discharged
prior
to
expiration
of
his
term
of
service
except
in
accordance
with
procedures
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
defense,
which
i
take
it
means
super
imposes
a
general
discretionary
authority
of
the
secretary
of
defense
upon
the
secretary
of
the
army.
but
congress
again
had
stayed
completely
away
from
the
whole
problem
of
what
types
of
discharges
there
shall
be
and
how
--
and
under
what
circumstances
they
shall
be
given.
now,
in
the
armed
forces
reserve
act
of
1952
which
is
directly
applicable
to
the
next
case
to
be
argued,
the
abramowitz
case,
there
is
a
similar
provision
providing
for
discharge
in
accordance
with
regulations
promulgated
by
the
appropriate
secretary
of
the
military
establishment.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
about
the
regulations.
and
the
types
of
discharges
have
been
for
generations
prescribed
by
the
heads
of
the
military
departments.
at
the
present
time
and
at
the
time
applicable
in
this
case,
there
were
five
types
of
discharges
given
by
the
army.
the
first,
the
appellate
as
i
put
it
is
the
so
called
honorable
discharge.
the
second,
the
one
which
petitioner
received
is
the
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
described
in
general
terms
in
page
--
at
page
32
of
our
brief,
with
a
general
indication
of
the
different
circumstances
under
which
each
type
of
discharge
becomes
appropriate.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
we
do
not
set
that
forth
in
text
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
i
think
it
might
have
been
well
to
do
that,
i
regrettably
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
but
we
--
i
will
be
happy
to
supply
the
court
with
--
with
verbatim
printed
copies
of
the
regulation
itself
if
that
would
be
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
they
--
they
are
set
forth
by
petitioner
in
his
brief
in
part
at
page
52
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
now,
if
--
if
the
court
wishes
to
turn
to
paragraph
eight,
near
the
bottom
of
page
52.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
not
that
sole
paragraph.
it
is
an
applicable
one
but
there
are
others
that
have
bearing
on
the
question.
but
counsel
for
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
under
paragraph
eight
of
that
regulation,
a
soldier
gets
the
honorable
discharge
if
his
character
and
efficiency
ratings
have
been
very
good
and
excellent,
and
he
has
not
been
convicted
by
court-martial,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
regulations.
now,
of
course
here,
there
is
an
except
as
otherwise
provided
because
the
reference
there
to
paragraph
13,
except
as
provided
in
these
regulations
and
pertinent
regulations
listed
in
paragraph
13,
paragraph
13
is
regrettably
not
printed
by
either
side,
but
i
have
it
here.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
i
--
i
--
of
course,
i
agree
the
court
should
have
it
and
i
suggest
that
perhaps
the
most
convenient
form
would
be
for
us
to
submit
the
--
the
official
printed
form
of
the
regulation
itself.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
i
do
not
agree
with
that,
and
that
leads
me
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
hope
i
do
too,
and
i
think
i
do.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
and
your
honor
means
enforce
it
in
the
civil
courts?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
do
for
the
reason.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
for
the
reason
that
congress
has
provided
an
alternative
system
of
justice
to
take
care
of
that
in
similar
situations.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
he
enforced
it
first
by
applying
to
the
army
discharge
review
board.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
we
say
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
we
say
no.
we
say
that
congress
with
finality
said,
"if
this
situation
arises,
we
will
give
the
solider
a
remedy
within
the
service
department
and
that's
the
end
of
it."
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
understand
but
i
am
saying
that
what
congress
said
was
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
even
in
that
extreme,
in
fact
almost
unimaginable
case,
we
would
say
that
he
could
not
because
congress
does
not
intend
that
there
shall
be
a
legal
right
in
the
justiciable
sense
to
a
particular
type
of
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
however,
precisely
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
exactly.
in
our
view,
congress
has
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
certainly
hope
so.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
that
is
an
element.
certainly,
that
is
an
important
element
in
this
case.
now,
the
statute
which
set
up
the
army
discharge
review
boards
provided
that
the
discharge
given
should
be
final
subject
only
to
review
by
the
secretary.
that
is
one
instance
of
a
congressional
statement
of
finality.
and
further
more
in
19
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no.
every
finality
clause
should
be
read
in
the
light
of
its
history.
and
we
say
here
that
this
finality
clause
is
to
be
read
in
that
light
for
the
historical
reason
that
traditionally
from
the
beginning
of
our
government
congress
has
left
it
wholly
up
to
the
service
departments
as
to
what
discharge
soldier
john
jones
gets.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
quite
agree
that
that
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
i
was
answering
your
honor's
contention.
the
suggestion
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
that
if
that
occurred
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
what
your
honor
is
now
suggesting
if
i
understand
you
is
that
probably
no
secretary
of
war
has
been
so
wholly
arbitrary
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
main
--
our
--
our
first
contention
is
that
congress
has
left
to
the
military
establishments
the
only
course
of
redress
for
situations
which
may
arise
and
has
provided
to
administrative
tribunals
within
each
military
establishment
for
that
expressed
purpose.
well,
if
it
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
this
that
--
that
precise
case
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
in
patterson
versus
lamb,
this
court
expressly
said
it
was
not
passing.
your
honors'
opinion
by
the
way
said
you
are
not
passing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
civil
court
had
any
jurisdiction
to
review
the
military
discharge
given.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
if,
if
your
honor
[laughs]
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
will
argue
any
question
which
a
justice
ask
me
to
argue.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
but
of
course
in
the
cases
which
have
come
before
this
curt
and
the
lower
courts,
in
large
part,
they
have
been
habeas
corpus
reviews
of
court-martial
proceedings.
and
the
test
there
which
the
court
has
laid
down
is
that
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
man
is
in
the
military
establishment
and
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
court-martial
which
tried
him
was
constituted
in
accordance
with
law
and
it
had
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
offense
with
which
he
was
charged,
that's
the
end
of
it.
that
for
considerations
of
army
discipline,
the
fact
that
the
military
establishment
is
an
entirely
separate
community,
as
this
court
has
put
it,
from
the
civil
community,
that
--
and
for
separation
of
powers
consideration
that
the
courts
do
not
at
all
take
the
same
type
of
review
of
military
action
as
they
do
of
course
of
governmental
action
which
affects
civilian
rights.
and
piecing
together
all
of
those
things,
the
consistent
course
of
congressional
action,
the
extremely
limited
review
which
this
court
has
given
even
in
the
habeas
corpus
case
where
a
statute
expressly
confers
upon
this
court
--
pardon
me,
and
on
the
district
courts,
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus.
taking
all
of
those
things
together,
we
consider
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
the
matter
of
a
man's
discharge
the
kind
of
a
legal
right
which
was
proper
subject
matter
for
the
civil
courts
to
pass
on.
now,
congress
has
recognized
the
distinction
between
the
various
types
of
discharges
in
this
sense.
the
so-called
punitive
discharges,
the
bad
conduct
and
the
dishonorable
discharges
may,
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
only
be
given
by
sentence
of
court-martial.
in
other
words,
that
is
a
form
of
punishment
imposed
upon
the
soldier
where
he
has
been
found
guilty
of
a
violation
of
offenses
formerly
prescribed
by
the
articles
of
war
and
now
carried
forward
into
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
so-called
administrative
types
of
discharge,
the
honorable
discharge,
the
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
and
the
undesirable
discharge,
those
are
not
given
for
the
commission
of
offenses
in
the
same
sense
at
all.
they
are
not
given
because
the
man
has
been
found
guilty
by
a
court-martial
offense,
they
are
given
because
the
army
has
decided
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
efficient
operation
of
the
army,
it's
better
off
not
to
have
private
john
jones
in
the
army.
now,
the
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
which
is
given
here
is
given
for
many
things
which
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
security
considerations.
it's
specifically
given,
for
instance,
if
the
soldier
lacks
physical
stamina.
it's
given
if
he
is
psychologically
ill-equipped
for
combat
conditions,
and
many
other
thing,
it
is
merely
a
determination
of
the
army,
that
although
the
man
has
served
under
honorable
conditions
for
one
reason
or
another
and
may
be
wholly
beyond
his
fault
or
anything
that
he
can
correct,
the
army
is
just
better
off
not
to
have
that
man
in
the
service.

in

mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
this
--
this
particular
edition
of
this
regulation
was
issued
prior
to
the
now
current
regulation
dealing
with
security.
but
in
the
current
edition
of
the
regulation,
that
is
listed
under
paragraph
13
which
is
the
army
regulation
604-10.
and
that
is
the
regulation
by
which
the
army
has
proscribed
a
security
standard.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines

--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
you
see
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
your
honor.
604-10
is
the
regulation
applicable
which
sets
forth
the
grounds
on
which
petitioner
was
dismissed
to
wit
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
concluded
that
his
retention
in
the
service
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
the
--
the
record
at
page
33,
you
will
find
set
forth
department
of
defense
directive
number
5210.9.
that
was
the
initial
statement
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
then
604-10
was
later
promulgated.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
it
has
not
been
set
forth
in
the
brief.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
statutes
are
printed,
your
honor.
you
mean
the
regulations,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
quite
agree
that
the
brief
should
have
been
more
complete
in
that
respect
and
i
do
not
like
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
do
not
like
to
disclaim
any
personal
responsibility
but
perhaps
the
court
will
permit
me
to
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
my
name
is
not
on
the
government's
brief.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
if
your
honor
has
the
briefs
in
the
next
case,
number
141.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
department
of
defense
directive
5210-9.
now,
the
explanation
for
that
as
i
understand
it,
and
this
is
a
point
on
which
petitioner
has
never
brought
forward.
the
--
the
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9
was
promulgated
in
april
of
1954.
that
same
month,
petitioner
was
given
his
first
discharge,
the
then
undesirable
discharge.
up
to
that
time,
the
army
had
not
promulgated
its
implementation
of
the
department
of
defense
directive.
that
implementation
is
army
regulation
604-10.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
it
is
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
we
--
we
take
the
--
we
take
the
position
that
the
department
of
defense
directive
in
itself
was
sufficiently
self
executing
so
to
speak,
that
it
would
justify
action
by
the
army
even
in
advance
of
the
promulgation
of
its
formal
security
regulation.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
that
--
that
was
directive
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
that
defense
directive
represented
the
promulgation
of
a
new
policy
with
respect
to
discharges,
to
wit
a
specific
basis
for
discharging
a
man
because
his
retention
in
the
service
was
not
deemed
to
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
interest.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
this
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
this
regulation
or
this
directive,
i
beg
your
pardon,
states
that
the
type
of
discharge
given
under
this
directive
shall
be
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
derogatory
information
against
the
man.
in
other
words,
it
--
the
type
of
discharge
might
vary
depending
upon
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
as
to
how
serious
the
case
against
him
was.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
now
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that,
your
honor,
but
may
i
point
out
that
there
were
two
discharges
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
good,
then
at
the
time
--
it
--
when
the
court
is
considering
the
last
discharge
as
being
the
only
one
in
effect,
that
is
the
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
agree.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
shall
proceed
chronologically.
at
the
time
that
petitioner
was
given
his
first
discharge
which
was
an
undesirable
discharge,
the
applicable
statute
was
the
act
of
1920
quoted
in
our
brief.
the
administrative
regulation
applicable
and
the
only
one
applicable
at
that
time
was
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9.
but
when
the
army
later
conducted
a
general
review
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
--
the
directive
is
in
the
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that's
in
the
record
itself.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
page
--
beginning
at
page
33
of
the
record.
and
that
is
the
only
administrative
regulation
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
first
discharge.
but
subsequently
after
this
lawsuit
was
in
process,
the
army
undertook
a
general
review
of
all
cases
going
back
several
years,
of
all
cases
of
soldiers
who
had
been
dismissed
under
the
so-called
security
program.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
he
was
dismissed
and
then
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
at
the
time
he
got
the
undesirable
discharge,
the
only
--
the
only
regulation
in
effect
was
the
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9
in
the
record
at
page
33.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
at
that
time
the
army
had
not
yet
promulgated
its
implementing
regulation.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
now
--
now
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
oh,
yes,
surely.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
the
regulation
in
effect
at
that
time
which
set
forth
the
conditions
under
which
different
types
of
discharges
would
be
given
was
the
one
to
which
i
previously
referred
army
regulations
615-360.
and
that
is
the
one
that
i
said
provided
for
a
discharge
for
a
lack
of
physical
stamina,
psychological
unsuitability
and
--
and
many
other
things.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
what
did
you
say
about
court-martial?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
a
homosexuality
is
an
example.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no
that's
the
whole
point.
these
administrative
discharges
are
not
given
as
a
consequence
of
a
conviction
of
any
offense
prescribed
by
the
articles
of
war.
they
merely
represent
the
judgment
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
that
we
feel
were
better
off
not
to
have
john
jones
in
the
army
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
no,
not
--
not
in
the
trial
in
the
sense
that
your
honor
is
speaking
of
it,
he
was
not.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
the
review
since
1954
has
been
provided
both
before
the
army
discharge
review
board,
where
the
man
does
have
a
full
opportunity
for
a
hearing
and
also
if
he's
turned
down
there,
he
goes
to
the
board
for
correction
of
military
records,
where
he
also
has
the
second
opportunity
for
a
full
hearing.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
since
1944.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
1944.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
1944.
the
army
discharge
review
board
was
established
by
statute
passed
in
1944.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
i
--
i
thought
i
indicated
that
the
particular
form
of
honorable
discharge
under
general
conditions
goes
back
to
1921,
i
believe
it
is,
and
it
is
true
that
prior
to
that
time,
there
were
other
forms
of
discharge
given
by
the
military
service
which
was
not
the
honorable
discharge
and
yet
was
not
a
dishonorable
discharge,
an
intermediate
form
of
discharge.that
sort
of
thing
goes
back
at
least
to
the
civil
war
and
the
--
the
precise
characterization
of
the
discharge
has
changed
in
accordance
with
change
in
regulations
from
time
to
time.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
with
the
court's
permission,
we
will
submit
a
brief
supplemental
memorandum
stating
those
facts
and
attaching
as
exhibits
printed
copies
of
all
the
regulations
which
are
not
set
forth
either
in
the
record
or
in
the
briefs.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
no,
pardon
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
pardon
me,
your
honor.
he
was
first
given
an
undesirable
discharge
but
that
was
not
the
question
of
the
transfer,
that
is
the
situation
which
occurs
in
the
next
case,
in
the
abramowitz
case.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
general.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
under
honorable
condition.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
agree
to
that
but
of
course,
whatever
the
army
did
in
connection
with
the
first
discharge,
whether
it
be
right
or
wrong
is
now
out
of
the
case,
because
the
first
discharge
has
been
wiped
out
and
he
now
has
the
general
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
what
i
--
my
--
of
course,
my
basic
point
is
that
that
is
not
a
matter
of
which
the
district
courts
that
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
except
that
that
fact
is
immaterial
in
this
case
because
they
did
give
him
a
second
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
read
from
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
read
from
our
brief
at
page
23,
a
quotation
from
the
act.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
a
quotation
from
the
act
of
june
4,
1920
which
was
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
and
was
applicable
to
petitioner's
situation.
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
23,
beginning
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
"no
enlisted
person
lawfully
inducted
into
the
military
service
of
united
states
shall
be
discharged
from
said
service
without
a
certificate
of
discharge
and
no
enlisted
person
shall
be
discharged
from
said
service
before
his
term
of
service
has
expired,
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
the
army
or
by
sentence
or
court
martial."
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
at
the
time
the
petition
was
given
his
first
discharge
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
which
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
--
the
very
interest,
and
i
may
use
your
honor's
word,
was
department
of
defense
directive
5210.9.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
language
would
be
the
very
opening
of
the
paragraph
eight
except
as
provided
in
these
regulations.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
at
that
time,
the
time
of
his
first
discharge,
and
the
only
regulation
was
the
department
of
defense
directives
which
we
have
referred
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
which
prescribed
a
security
risk
program
for
the
armed
services.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
in
the
directive?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
the
directive
which
is
in
the

yes.

paragraph
five.

your

that
he
shall

well,
the
character
of

mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
am
not
able
to
accept
your
honor's
generalization
that
even
prior
thereto,
every
man
who
served
honorably
in
the
army
got
an
honorable
discharge.
a
man
can
serve
honorably
in
the
army
and
yet
he
didn't
have
the
physical
stamina
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
to
be
of
service.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
yet
he
didn't
get
an
honorable
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
that's
my
point.
such
a
man
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
and
that's
my
point,
such
a
man.
purely
because
of
his
--
his
physical
weakness
does
not
get
the
honorable
discharge.
that's
just
my
point.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
your
honor,
that
--
that
statement
which
is
what
petitioner's
counsel
made
is
not
an
accurate
statement
of
petitioner's
army
record.
what
he
had
was
findings
of
excellence
for
fitness
and
character
up
until
the
time
that
the
army
started
the
proceedings
which
led
to
his
discharge.
but
for
the
period
of
the
last
few
months
of
his
military
service,
he
did
not
have
such
a
rating.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
but
i
--
i
thought
your
honor
was
--
i
merely
wanted
to
correct
the
record
in
that
respect.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
approximately
18
--
oh,
his
conduct
was
unknown?
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
yes,
that's
the
last
six
weeks
or
so
of
his
service
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
just
prior
to
his
dismissal
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
when
these
proceedings
were
undertaken.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
well,
that's
true
within
the
terms
if
the
man
comes
under
paragraph
eight.
but
of
course
if
he
comes
under
the
exception
set
forth
in
paragraph
eight,
then
that
provision
has
no
application.
that
talks
about
the
circumstances
under
which
you
will
get
an
honorable
discharge
if
you
are
under
paragraph
eight.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
except
as
--
except
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
--
as
otherwise
prescribed.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
and
that's
the
point.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
13
doesn't
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
because
13
provides
other
grounds
for
discharge
and
as
to
which
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
army
man's
formal
rating
is
immaterial.
in
other
words,
a
man
might
have
been
rated
by
his
commanding
officer
as
excellent
and
yet
the
army
discovers
that
he
is
a
homosexual.
he
nonetheless
maybe
discharged
under
their
exception
regulation
without
being
given
an
honorable
discharge.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
the
only
thing
in
existence
was
5210.9.
mr.
donald
b.
macguines
i
--
i
regret
that
my
time
has
expired.
i
shall
not
have
the
chance
to
discuss
our
alternative
point
that
even
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
is
no
justiciable
controversy
and
that
there
is
no
legal
injury
resulting
from
the
issuance
of
the
general
discharge
to
the
petitioner,
but
that
is
discussed
in
our
brief.
