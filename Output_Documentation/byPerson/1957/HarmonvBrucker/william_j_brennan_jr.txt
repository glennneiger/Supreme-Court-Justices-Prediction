justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
only?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
right
there.
now,
you
told
me
earlier
that
this
really
narrowed
down
to
a
question
of
the
construction
of
4
(b)
as
the
regulation
reflected
--
that
you
--we've
been
discussing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you've
--
now
you've
introduced
some
constitutional
consideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
significance
of
your

you

active

on

well,
in
fact
--
actual
fact,
he
is
not
doing
any
military
chores
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
his
party
membership
was
admitted?

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
finding
as
to
when
the
membership
was?
you
mentioned
the
year
--
when
he
was
18
or
19.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
in
service
men?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
party
membership
and
alleged
party
membership
of
1948
or
1949
or
other
charges
as
well?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
there
would
have
been
a
hiatus
between
the
receipt
of
the
honorable
separation,
is
that
what
you
call
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
discharge.
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
usual
course
why
--
why
is
that,
if
you
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
mean
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
this
business
of
two
separate
documents,
an
honorable
separation
and
later
a
discharge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
answers
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
suggesting
error
in
this
case
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
you're
wrong
but
the
courts
can't
do
anything
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
macguineas,
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
we
think
that
there
is
jurisdiction.
as
i
get
it
on
the
merits,
you're
confessing
for
the
government
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
at
least,
should
win.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
we're
talking
about
this
one
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
get
the
answer
for
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
want
to
find
out
--
now
if
we
disagree
with
all
three
of
those
positions,
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
where
do
you
end
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
beyond
that
mr.
macguineas.
you
said
that
justice
had
so
advised
the
army.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
as
i
understood
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
the
fact?
and
not
withstanding
that
advice?
is
the
army
still
following
this
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
something
as
to
this?
isn't
this
one
document,
face
side
is
the
discharge
and
the
reverse
side
is
the
214?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two
separate
documents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
always
been
so
or
is
that
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
so
also
stops?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
one
is
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
put
in
mind,
the
face
was
discharge
and
the
reverse
was
just
214.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
harmon
discharged
before
his
term
of
service
expired?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however
arbitrary
the
action
of
the
army
may
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
how
extreme
we
may
suppose
a
case
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
has
no
remedy
in
the
court
of
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
establish
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
be
very
delightful
from
hearing
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
congress
has
done
that,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
question
whether
in
the
case
of
an
arbitrary
action
such
as
i
put
to
you,
there
was
a
denial
at
least
to
due
process.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
does
this
fall
under?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
this,
mr.
macguineas.
is
this
605-10
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
or
whatever
it
is,
a
supplement
or
amendment
to
13
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
that's
what
i
asked
you
before.
is
it
that
you're
suggesting
that
the
604-10,
i
gather
now
that
this
--
whatever
the
other
one
was,
i'm
so
confused
about
all
this
now.
but
my
understanding
is
that
as
to
the
department
of
defense,
security
regulation
is
appropriate,
upon
which
you
justify
the
action
taken
as
to
harmon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
done
by
reason
of
an
argument
that,
that
somehow
amends
the
regulation
9
as
to
general
discharges
or
the
regulation
of
8
as
to
honorable
discharges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
that
argue
then
that
completely
independent
of
the
regulations
8
and
9,
governing
honorable
and
general
discharges.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
policy
of
itself
justifies
what
was
done
without
reference
to
those
regulations?
