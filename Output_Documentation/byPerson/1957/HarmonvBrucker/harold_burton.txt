burton
then
--
then
the
courts
are
free
to
reexamine
the
degree
of
his
delinquency?
justice
harold
burton
i
understand
you're
drawing
the
line
as
a
free
service
point
but
once
you
take
it
to
action,
doing
the
service,
you're
going
to
ask
the
court
to
examine
to
what
he
said
that
went.
justice
harold
burton
you
mean
take
the
reward
and
can't
go
beyond
those
characterizations?
