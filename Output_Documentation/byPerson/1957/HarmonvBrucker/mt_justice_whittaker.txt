mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
do
you
--
i
--
am
i
mistaken
in
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
placed
its
decision
on
the
ground
that
want
the
jurisdiction?
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
so,
instead
of
having
as
you
say
one
question
namely,
the
power
of
the
army
or
its
officials
to
grant
a
discharge
of
this
type
to
that
--
to
this
particular
--
to
mr.
harmon.
you
do
have
this
initial
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
i
--
i'm
fearful
of
interrupting
but
i
want
to
--
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
--
just
clear
in
my
mind.
do
you
concede
that
the
affirmative
acts
taken
by
mr.
harmon
while
a
soldier
were
grounds
for
giving
him
less
than
a
--
a
dishonorable
discharge?
for
example,
the
writing
of
the
one
letter
or
to
--
or
the
two
letters
to
the
two
individuals
asking
him
to
contribute
money
to
the
defense
--
smith
act
defendants.
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
well
then,
do
they
--
if
those
--
if
those
matters
are
of
no
consequence
to
the
case,
then
do
you
have
not
have
just
simply
the
question
of
whether
or
not
though
his
service
was
entirely
honorable
while
in
the
army,
question
whether
he
could
be
given
an
honorable
discharge
for
antecedent
conduct?
mr.
mt.
justice
whittaker
well,
didn't
he
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
