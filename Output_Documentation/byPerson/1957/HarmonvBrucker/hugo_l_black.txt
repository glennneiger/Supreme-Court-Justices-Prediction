you
mean
of
your
petition

the
question
asked

that
a

committed

that's

is
there
anything

justice

is
that
conceded?
justice

the

you
have
to
get
reversed?

when

you

the

notified?
justice

were
those
passed
on
account
of
any
other
discharge
except
one
in
use
due
to
court-martial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
reason
why
you
didn't
put
these
regulations
in
because
you
consider
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
irrelevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
on
that
--
on
that
particular
point?
i
have
before
me
the
act
which
authorizes
the
creation
of
the
army.
it
provides
that
one
who
satisfactorily
performed
his
service,
satisfactorily
to
the
army,
must
get
his
job
back
when
he
gets
back
from
the
army
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
with
the
government
or
with
private
employees,
they
can
do
that.
the
machinery
set
up
per
block
should
be
given.
what
about
a
man
who
gets
an
undesirable
discharge?
could
that
be
considered
as
satisfactory
to
the
--
its
services
is
satisfactory
to
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say,
you're
trying
to
show
that
the
new
york
--
he
would
not
suffer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
new
york
law
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
not
in
fact
at
itself
show
that
he
must
perform
his
services
of
satisfactory
to
the
army
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
order
to
get
the
benefits
conferred
by
that
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
new
york.
i'm
talking
about
federally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
which
--
the
statute
which
we've
had
before
in
another
case,
previously,
authorizes
people
who
satisfactorily
perform
their
services
to
the
army
to
give
--
to
get
their
job
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
his
--
discharge
is
undesirable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
still
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
both
on
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
--
one
of
them
is
undesirable
and
then
the
other
one
is
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
macguineas,
what
is
your
position
in
the
attorney
general's
department?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
type
of
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
that
not
a
part
of
the
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
that's
the
only
reason
they
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did
it
for
that
reason,
and
they
did
it
for
other
reasons,
i
assume
other
reasons
that
were
improper
for
them
to
consider.
what
is
the
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
decide
it
line
of
this
general
position
in
connection
with
agencies
and
are
with
verdicts
of
the
conviction.
and
if
there
are
several
reasons
given,
some
are
bad,
it
might
not
--
consequence
might
not
have
resulted
and
had
been
limited
to
the
good
reasons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
want
to
talk
about
being
limited.
i
was
wondering
why
both
questions
are
not
present
in
your
case,
maybe
they
are
none.
so,
i
was
wondering
why
both
questions
are
not
present.
number
one,
whether
it's
legal
to
consider
a
man's
past
character
as,
i
understood
you
to
say
was
done
here,
investigated,
rely
on
that.
secondly,
whether
it's
legal
to
consider
what
happened
after
he
was
in
the
army.
now,
assuming
that
one
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
discharge
was
justifiable
on
one
of
the
two
causes,
how
could
we
know
that
it
would
have
occurred
had
they
not
relied
on
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that's
your
argument
with
reference
to
it
as
to
why
it
was
wrong
to
rely
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
concede
it
was
right
to
rely
on
the
other
part
as
to
what
happened
before
he
got
into
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
discussed
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
is
this
--
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
on
page
111
is
--
purports
to
be
one
side
of
the
document,
on
page
112
the
other
side,
is
that
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
two
separate
pages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
have
--
how
old
is
the
second
type
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
old
is
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
in
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
this
general
discharge
rated
in
the
classification
number
awarded
less
than
the
honorable
discharge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
properly
classified
there
as
being
a
discharge
lest
anomalous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
army
reports
when
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
army
reports?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
think
probably
you
are
wrong
in
saying
that
is
less
than
an
honorable
discharge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
--
is
this
the
only
one
to
which
we
need
look
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
the
authority
for
this
particular
discharge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
there
been
regulations
which
have
the
effective
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
you
have
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
controlling
one
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
to
be
sure
in
the
influence.
suppose
of
what
you
say
--
suppose
the
army
had
said
yes,
we
discharged
him
--
we
discharged
him
because
we
didn't
like
his
religion,
to
give
him
a
discharge
less
than
honorable,
could
he
go
to
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
main
basis
of
the
argument
in
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
--
what
case
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
both
instance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
it
that
way
--
you
have
it
that
way,
you
could
read
it
to
us
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless,
it's
too
long.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
cited
--
is
that
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
614?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
in
the
record
or
in
your
brief?
if
it's
to
knowing,
why
--
why
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeal
both
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
of
appeals
invoke
that
withholding
regulations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
just
asking
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
this
case,
referred
to
that
regulation,
what
you
say
is
controlling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
you
say
is
controlling,
had
not
been
promulgated
by
the
army
at
the
time
the
man
was
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
event
that
provided
for
discharges
for
conduct
which
would
reflect
discredit
on
that
soldier
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
over
this
court
martial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
of
those
grounds
in
that
statute,
in
that
regulation,
to
authorize
discharges
of
the
kind
that
would
reflect
discredit
on
the
character
of
the
solider
otherwise,
other
than
those
which
provided
the
court-martial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
was
it
provided
that
he
should
have
a
trial
of
any
kind,
to
be
convicted
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
because
the
question,
he
is
a
homosexual
there,
what
proof?
whose
judgment
was
obtained
on
that
besides
the
secretary
of
the
army?
what
did
the
man
have
to
do
with
it?
was
he
given
a
trial
of
any
kind
before
that
was
put
on
his
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
any
kind
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
any
kind
of
the
hearing
such
as
a
man
would
want
who
was
charged
with
a
very
serious
thing
of
that
kind.
you
mean
that
the
army,
secretary
of
the
army
could
just
say
we
don't
want
him,
he
is
a
homosexual
without
proof,
without
anything
else,
with
no
review
of
him.
justice
hugo
l.

that's
since
1954.
justice
hugo
l.
black
1944?
justice
hugo
l.

do
you
agree
that
the
type
of
discharge
the
army
was
entitled
to
give
this
man
at
the
time
he
was
discharged
is
governed
and
has
to
be
governed
by
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
he
was
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
claim
that
--
do
you
argue,
this
man
was
discharged
undesirable,
this
(inaudible)
separate
from
the
amy
referred,
whatever
period
of
time
it
was,
could
be
subjective,
the
kind
of
discharge
that
was
not
authorized
in
the
statue.
it
was
only
authorized
in
the
later
regulation,
or
do
you
say
--
do
you
agree
that
the
army,
whenever
it
formalizes
discharge,
had
to
be
governed
by
the
law
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
it
actually
put
him
out
of
the
army.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
--
but
in
the
general
discharge,
the
second
discharge,
determining
whether
the
statute
authorized
that
kind
of
discharge.
we
have
to
be
governed,
do
we
not,
by
the
law
that
was
in
effect
when
they
put
him
out
of
the
army,
not
by
the
law
as
it
was
changed
thereafter.
justice
hugo

but
if
--
if
we
have
done

the
army
had
--
justice

black
--to
be
governed,
--
justice

black
now,
where
did
you
say
they
could
what
they
did
here
in

regulation?
which
part
of

part

you

what
kind
of

a

does
it
authorize
in
any
way
departure
from
the
traditional
discharge
with
the
army
since
the
first
day
it
started
to
function,
for
non-honorable
discharge
for
a

who's
honorably
served

does

show
any

any
departure,
right
of

why
certainly

--
justice

black
--
that
wouldn't
reflect

that
wouldn't
reflect
on
his
honor,
the
fact
that
he
was
weak,

got
sick.
i'm
talking
about
the
honorable
discharge.
