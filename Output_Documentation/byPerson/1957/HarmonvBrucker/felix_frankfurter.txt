justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
detroit
urban
league
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
was
there
about
detroit
urban
league
that
he
is
a
member
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
on
attorney
general's
brief?
do
you
have
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
national
urban
league?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
do
you
say
that
the
secretary
has
--
the
army
under
the
statute
is
not
authorized
to
issue
this
kind
of
a
discharge
or
it
does
not
authorize
to
use
this
kind
of
a
discharge
as
to
this
particular
petitioner,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
saying
that
the
army,
under
the
regulation
--
under
the
statute,
can't
make
--
can
have
this
category,
this
kind
of
a
--
of
a
discharge,
a
situation
that
are
appropriate
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
the
chief
justice's
question
implied
narrowly
(inaudible)
if
i
understood
it
whether
the
discharge
must
cover
merely
--
but
i
think
it
was
solely
and
you
say
in
effect
it
does
before
he
gets
into
trouble
with
a
single
authority.
he
maybe
define
by
being
arrested
from
being
able
to
compel
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
you
would
say,
this
honorable
conduct
not
related
to
soldiering
while
he
was
on
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
soldiering
i
mean,
during
the
work
of
a
soldier.
but
in
connection
to
that,
he
cheated
at
power
or
he
wrote
the
--
a
president
letter
(inaudible).
i
don't
want
to
involve
anything
or
imply
anything
that
would
happen
(inaudible)
that
wasn't
--
could
not
be
taken
into
account.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
anything
having
to
do
with
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
mean
to
very
effective
and
dishonorable
act,
for
that
as
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it's
unrelated
but
in
the
orderly
walks
of
life,
you
would
say,
he
was
guilty
of
dishonorable
conduct,
then
you
would
say
it
cannot
affect
the
quality
of
the
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
--
and
your
argument
is
that
an
honorable
discharge
must
be
given
unless
--
unless
there
is
a
failure
to
satisfy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
unless
not
with
the
chief
justice's
question,
he
is
involved
with
the
law
so
that
he
might
be
(inaudible)
or
physically
unable
to
carry
out
his
soldier's
duty
or
unless
he
violates
some
controlling
the
military
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
he
would
--
with
respectful
aspect
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
outside,
nothing
outside
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
can't
tell
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
goes
beyond
that.
does
that
mean,
that
while
he
was
--
while
he
was
(inaudible)
must
have
honorable
discharge
waiting
for
the
moment
to
the
question
of
privilege.
secretary
brucker
with
the
additional
statement
have
just
given,
john
henry
harmon
an
honorable
discharge
but
i
want
the
world
to
know
what
he
did
while
he's
in
the
service,
reflecting
on
his
character.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
true
would
if
--
it
wouldn't
be
defamation.
your
case
really
gets
down
to
(inaudible)
of
this
man
by
not
giving
him
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
law.
your
suit
is
that
this
man,
human
beings
are
deprived
of
rights
not
documented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
more
to
find
out
whether
that
made
an
element
of
misconduct
which
(inaudible)
and
the
employer
asked
all
about,
and
the
employer
would
give
that
information,
he
would
be
protected
by
all
the
libel
laws
because
it
is
relevant
to
telling
the
truth,
the
whole
truth
of
what
he
(inaudible)
service.
the
question
is,
assuming
he
could
be
discharged
for
that
conduct
--
of
that
action
(inaudible).
but
the
government
can't
tell
why
he
was
discharged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
--
the
government
can't
tell
that
they
fired
him
for
what
would
be
a
dishonorable
conduct
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
make
the
government's
position
more
ridiculous
or
more
extreme
than
it
is.
their
position
is
not
that
they
can
violate
the
constitution.
their
position
is
that
under
the
distribution
of
powers
within
the
constitution,
the
matters
are
left
to
the
military
not
subject
to
civil
reviews
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
do
me
a
favor,
just
be
active.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
things
that
are
not
reviewable
in
court.
of
course,
the
united
states
can
do
a
lot
of
things.
it
can
send
the
militia
into
a
place
and
not
be
subject
to
review
by
the
courts,
100
years
ago
or
more
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
sorts
of
things.
let's
not
get
into
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
case
is
not
so
bad
that
you
have
to
be
inaccurate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
inaccurate
if
you
say
the
government
contends
that
they
can
indulge
in
unconstitutional
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
taken
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
reason
--
what
is
the
basis
for
a
statement
you
just
made
that
no
matter
what
offenses,
or
what
misconduct,
or
what
dishonorable
habits,
if
you
please,
that
as
to
which
no
information
was
had
until
prior
to
induction
but
as
to
which
information
came
later
that
in
such
instance,
you
must
get
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
with
the
case,
what
is
the
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
asked
is
if
you
take
this
into
account
(inaudible).
from
the
cases
that
have
come
here,
i
infer
that
in
a
--
in
a
good
many
instances,
i
don't
know
quantitatively
what
extent,
but
in
the
good
--
in
good
many
instances,
people
are
discharged
and
then
later,
reenlist.
and
that's,
i
take
it
the
function
of
this
--
what
is
it?
dd214.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
when
they
reenlist,
knowledge
maybe
in
existence,
if
it
was
not
in
existence,
time
of
the
original
enlistment,
as
i
understand
your
remark,
or
what
you
said
is,
that
with
such
knowledge,
take
the
extreme
case
of
--
suppose
by
my
brother
harlan,
that
that
can't
be
recorded
on
a
piece
of
paper
so
that
on
reenlistment,
it
will
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
authorities
so
that
they
wouldn't
take
him
in,
if
they
have
a
right
not
to
take
him
in.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
will
take
justice
harlan's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
and
i
are
taking,
i
suppose
it's
true
of
everybody,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
which
we
couldn't
prove
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
we
act
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
put
on
in
the
dd214?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
constitutional
distinction
between
putting
it
on
one
piece
of
paper
and
not
on
another
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
often
asked
with
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
on
my
part
to
not
to
lend
a
sympathetic
ear.
you're
allowing
things
on
file
that
can't
be
made
public.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
your
view
with
the
existing
statutes
--
could
the
commander-in-chief
issue
an
order
today
that
hereafter,
there
would
be
not
issue
these
pieces
of
paper
just
during
discharge
but
that
each
servicemen
would
get
an
individual
document
setting
forth
the
estimate
by
the
army
of
the
quality
of
his
services
and
his
desirability
as
a
continuing
person
or
future
person
in
the
army?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
the
slightest
idea
what
the
answers
to
these
questions
are.
could
the
commander-in-chief,
tomorrow,
provide
that
every
person
should
get
only
a
dd214?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
other
information
is
contained
there
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
prefer
to
say
the
commander-in-chief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
i
said
commander-in-chief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
that's
the
point
of
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
army
or
defense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
army.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
secretary
for
the
army,
if
he
acted
confidently
or
would
you
regard
to
what
the
law
allows
him
to
do
--
never
mind
for
a
minute
what
seems
to
me
a
whole
different
question
where
the
courts
can
do
something
about
what
wrong
some
officials
may
do,
that's
a
very
different
question.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
a
duly
advised,
legally
advised
secretary
for
the
army
is
not
within
his
power
to
grant
--
not
to
give
an
honorable
discharge
for
a
man
whose
service,
who
saw
during
the
record
is
unexceptionably,
if
you
please,
heroic
for
preinduction
activity
of
the
kind
now
before
this
court?
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
could
not
if
he
--
if
he
were
a
fair
or
an
informed
judge
of
his
powers
grant
such
a
--
failed
to
grant
honorable
discharge.
is
that
what
you've
said
in
your
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
ask
this
question.
if
you
said
that
--
if
you
say,
fully
apart
from
the
question
of
judicial
reviewability
that
this
is
beyond
the
legal
authority
of
the
secretary
for
the
army,
why
hasn't
the
department
of
justice
so
advised
the
secretary
of
army
in
this
very
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
you
avoid
any
of
the
department
of
justice
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
(voice
overlap)
i
haven't
--
i
just
look
up
to
see
whether
there
are
certain
cases
cited
in
your
brief.
so,
i
don't
know
what
your
--
what's
in
your
brief.
i
can
well
understand.
i
can
thoroughly
understand
that
the
department
of
justice
may
deem
it
--
its
duty
to
come
before
this
court
and
to
say,
“we
are
not
going
to
consider
any
of
the
merit.
we're
not
going
to
say
a
thing
about
the
substantive
matters.
we
are
simply
going
to
say
that
this
court,
like
the
lower
court,
has
no
jurisdiction
period.”
i
can
well
understand
it
and
i
think
there
are
territories
when
the
department
would
be
dearly
in
not
taking
such
a
position.
now
is
all
--
is
that
the
only
position
the
department
is
taking
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
then
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
also
true
on
the
first
case,
that
it's
merely
a
denial
of
the
jurisdiction
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
--
that
isn't
my
question.
i
haven't
put
it
clearly.
i
understand
that
you
make
--
that
you
take
a
flat
precision
that
the
action
by
the
military
authority
in
granting
or
denying
discharges
or
in
defining
the
character
of
the
piece
of
paper
which
a
discharge
he
gets
is
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
i
understand
that.
i
understand
the
--
i
think.
i
understand
the
reasons
behind
that
contention.
but
i
want
to
know,
is
that
the
only
position
--
the
only
question
you
put
in
both
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
that
aside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
standing
here.
but
you
do
not
go
beyond
those
two
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
there
is
no
legal
right
enforceable
and
be
at
any
event,
the
judiciary
can't
intrude
into
this
territory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
answered
this
morning,
you
are
quite
unequivocal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
this
morning
that
that
makes
no
difference,
that
the
action
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
secretary
of
the
army
is
unreviewable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
though
it
explicitly
departs
from
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
this
court
has
held
in
an
opinion
with
which
i
do
not
happen
to
agree
that
the
--
that
the
--
even
the
explicit
confession
of
error
by
solicitor
general
cannot
be
taken,
that
this
court
must
decide
questions
of
law
but
what
you've
said
is
so
important,
in
my
view,
that
i
for
one
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
would
very
much
like
without
questioning
what
you've
said
to
have
the
solicitor
general
over
his
own
signature
state
explicitly
the
scope
of
the
confession
you've
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
give
it
to
him
for
his
secret
archive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(voice
overlap)
in
a
real
world.
you
give
it
to
him
because
it
has
importance
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
does
--
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
send
such
a
--
what
you
call
private
letter
to
a
channel
which
you
know
it
has
to
go
through
six
people
before
it
gets
the
recipient,
you're
charged
with
notice
of
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
discharge
isn't
quite
a
private
document,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
will
you
be
good
enough
to
communicate
the
solicitor
general
the
colloquy
that
you
and
i
had
on
the
subject
of
your
authority
to
make
these
confessions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
to
make
it
--
i'm
asking
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
instructed
to
make
the
confession
that
you
--
to
the
extent
that
you've
made
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
you
say
then
that
the
solicitor
--
solicitor
general
instructed
you
to
make
these
confess
--
confessions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
that's
so
then
i
don't
see
why
the
chief
justice
said,
“we
spent
all
this
time.”
well
you
didn't
say
that
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
before
you
got
on
your
feet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
never
had
any
doubt
about
that
but
you
thought
you
said
what
was
right
but
the
department
when
it
confesses
error
does
so
in
writing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
because
--
is
that
because
the
commanding
officer's
wife
that
he
wrote
to
some
civilian
outside,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
writing
a
private
letter
isn't
a
scandalous
conduct
in
the
ordinary
sense,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
have
to
--
he
couldn't
--
if
he
wrote
a
letter,
private
letters
like
that,
they
can't
do
anything
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
they
couldn't
court
--
they
could
court-martial,
but
they
couldn't
take
note
of
the
fact
he
is
that
kind
of
a
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
do
you
agree
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that?
they
could
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
couldn't
discharge
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
reaching
the
question
here.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
--
what
the
powers
are
not
what
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
because
they
don't
like
his
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
discharge
him
because
he
wrote
a
systematically
scandalous
letter
to
private
people,
they
could
not
--
they
--
you
said
they
could
discharge
him
but
they
couldn't
make
public
that
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
ought
to
give
him
an
honorable
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
inherent
you
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
mean
is
that
an
honorable
discharge
carries
certain
representations
to
the
public,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
are
those
representations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
case
you
put
earlier?
writing
a
lot
of
scandalous
--
obscene
letters
to
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
carrying
a
sword
and
shooting
and
polishing
his
shoes
et
cetera,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
have
been
found
cheating
at
cards
in
all
powers.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
court-martial
attempt,
probably
not,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
he
--
suppose
it
was
found
he
done
that
all
the
time,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
might
be
a
very
brave
and
rather
even
if
you
plea
a
distinguished
soldier
in
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
proper.
those
are
not
inconsistent
as
we
know
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nonetheless,
he
would
have
to
be
given
honorable
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
--
could
the
congress
of
united
states
take
a
different
view
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
position
is
as
i
understand
it
yesterday
and
today
that
as
a
matter
of
statutorylimitation
upon
the
defense
services
or
the
army,
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
limitation,
statutory
requirement,
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
discharges
that
they'd
be
given,
one
honorable
and
one
dishonorable.
and
the
dishonorable
discharge
requires
certain
conviction
or
offenses
or
misconduct
in
the
actual
soldiering
in
its
technical,
narrow
restrictive
meaning
of
that
word,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
such
as?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
restricting
your
argument
as
you
indicated
yesterday
to
pre-service
disqualification
because
you
said
in
your
case
there
is
an
element
of
conduct
under
scrutiny
during
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
during
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
now
drawing
a
line
between
activities
and
conduct,
call
it
what
you
will,
what
you
regard
as
unrelated
to
soldiery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
the
mere
quality
of
his
character
is
unrelated
to
soldiers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
can't
show
on
the
--
on
the
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
a
discharge
that
is
general
discharge
with
--
what
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
your
objection
to
that
is
that
it's
not
explicitly
stated
an
honorable
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
given
in
this
form
because
the
army
thought
that
that
which
took
place
while
he
was
in
the
service
or
on
his
conduct
as
a
soldier
or
his
qualification
as
a
solider
or
the
kind
of
authentication
the
government
wanted
to
make
which
barred
them,
which
led
them
to
prefer
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions
rather
than
honorable
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
review
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
this
statute
and
even
the
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
before
you
move
on
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
new
york
education
law
makes
a
distinction
between
an
honorable
discharge
and
a
general
discharge
under
honorable
conditions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
make
it
--
what
is
the
distinction
between?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
what
is
the
distinction
that
the
new
york
education
law
makes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
discharge
under
honorable
conditions?
when
does
that
get
into
the
--
in
the
former
military
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
what
is
it,
regulations
or
--
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
new
york
education
law
responds
to
that
record
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
on
that
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
the
new
york
statute
take
cognizance
of
this
distinction
made
in
the
army
regulations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
does
one
reach
that
conclusion?
i
mean
speaking
for
myself
if
i
hadn't
read
that
and
read
all
this,
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
me
that
the
fellow
has
a
piece
of
paper
that
he's
discharged
under
honorable
conditions,
that
honorable
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing
as
an
honorable
discharge.
i
know
that
isn't
so
but
how
do
--
how
can
one
be
so
sure
that
inherently
there
is
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
honorable,
do
the
words
honorable
mean
different
things,
as
--
as
they're
differently
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
wonder
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
notice
of
that
as
a
psychological
fact
so
i
myself
--
it
never
would
have
occurred
as
to
my
stupid
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
the
separation
certificate
a
different
thing
from
discharge
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
every
soldier
get
a
summary,
a
brief
of
his
war
--
of
his
military
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
discharge
certificate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
surprising.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
he
gets
--
you
get
this
214
in
lieu
of
a
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
saying
in
that
separation,
in
that
214,
the
army
can't
put
down
why
he
was
separated.
we
haven't
got
that
question
before
us
at
all.
but
i'd
suppose,
unless
you
correct
me
--
unless
i'm
corrected
that
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
piece
of
paper
called
a
discharge.
and
that
gives
a
summary
history
of
his
--
of
his
military
record
and
that
is
--
may
be
called
for
if
he
seeks
to
re-enlist,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
this.
that's
not
here
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
--
but
have
we
got
that
certificate
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
also
challenging
the
right
of
the
army
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
dd
214
isn't
what
the
word
at
large
seems,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
used.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
am
greatly
surprised.
i
hadn't
realized
if
it's
to
hear
what
the
government
says
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
rightness
of
the
government
to
reissue
214.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
but
you
are
denying
that
that's
the
routine
that
they
are
used
--
that
there
are
normally
two
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes.
and
are
you
saying
that
there
can
be
no
record
made
anywhere
of
the
basis
for
his
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
but
if
he
is
severed
because
for
a
reason,
they
cannot
put
on
record
why
he
was
severed,
is
that
right?
if
they
hadn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
some
document
in
the
war
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
his
constitutional
rights
to
the
person
--
as
i
understood
mr.
shapiro's
argument
is
that
the
terms
under
which
an
honorable
discharge
must
be
given
and
defined
by
a
statute
and
that
he
comes
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
may
reach
--
so
he
may
not
reach
the
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
start
with
the
constitutional
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
distinction
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
not
there
to
contend
or
do
you
contend
they
mean
the
same
thing?
and
if
they
mean
the
same
thing,
then
why
not
use
the
same
phrase?
and
if
they
don't
mean
the
same
thing,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
--
who
put
this
classification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
still
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
--
would
you
agree
that
if
in
fact
without
any
controversy
about
the
underlying
fact
establishment,
if
in
fact
a
claim
is
made
that
a
discharged
soldier
comes
within
a
particular
regulation
and
he
has
been
denied
what
the
face
of
the
regulation
entitled
him
to
that
he
could
enforce
that
regulation
even
in
a
court
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
get
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is,
if
in
contesting,
a
person
comes
within
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
army,
they
say
any
person
is
valid
by
the
one,
two,
three
condition,
comes
within
this
regulation
rather
than
that,
you
can
enforce
that
regulation
provided
there
is
no
controversy
as
to
where
they
comes
within
that
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
regulation
says
that
he
is
entitled
to
this
kind
of
a
discharge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
i
am
--
i
come
within
those
terms
and
the
war
department
comes
in
and
says,
"yes,
he
comes
within
those
terms,
but
we
have
chosen
not
to
enforce
that
regulation."
you
say
even
then
there
is
no
resort
to
the
civil
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
he
enforce
that
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
--
he
goes
through
the
whole
thing
and
the
secretary
for
the
army,
let
me
suppose,
an
unfair
situation.
everybody
along
the
line
disregard,
says,
"yes,
he
comes
within
this
regulation
but
we
are
not
going
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
then
enforces
it
in
the
court
of
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
he
exhausted
all
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
this
case
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
case
to
correct
you,
but
i
suggest
there
is
no
case
which
worries
you
or
calls
upon
you
to
take
the
position
as
they
did.
no
case
in
which
the
extreme
limits
of
military
authority
and
non-interference
by
the
civil
authority
has
been
recognized
that
warrants
the
statement
that
you
made
because
no
situation
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
presented
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
do
you
argue
such
an
extreme
position
of
what
you
don't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
there
are
various
ways
of
answering
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
way
of
answering
is
that
i
am
not
qualified
to
take
a
position
for
the
government
in
the
situation
that
it
support.
that's
one
way
of
answering.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
i
am
suggesting
at
all,
i
am
suggesting
that
a
lawyer
with
the
responsibility
of
the
seriousness
that
confronts
the
government
in
this
case
need
not
take
the
extreme
position
that
the
record
doesn't
call
for.
that's
what
i
am
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
going
to
argue
that
too?
justice
felix
frankfurter
argue
that
constitutional
question?
whether
--
whether
congress
has
power
to
leave
all
military
matters
to
the
military
authorities,
you
are
going
to
argue
that
question
in
this
case
too?
what
else
aren't
you
going
to
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
my
notion
of
your
responsibility
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
at
the
risk
of
repetition,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
categorically
what
materials
statutory
regulatory
directive
were
in
existence
at
the
time
that
this
discharge
was
issued?
thus,
give
me
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reference.
if
you're
not
--
didn't
you
say
you
haven't
prepared
this
brief,
you
must
have
been
--
you're
not
speaking
to
the
brief
when
you're
speaking
to
your
own
preparation.
now,
what
materials
underlay
what
relevant
controlling
materials
or
authorizing
materials
were
in
existence
when
this
discharge
was
issued?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
what
--
all
right
i
mean
the
one
that's
before
us
because
i
take
it
the
other
one
is
displaced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
others
may
think,
but
for
me
that's
the
question
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
tempering.
(inaudible)
you're
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
this
confusion
when
we
haven't
got
the
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
--
were
there
no
regulations
enforced
at
the
time
defining
categories
of
discharges
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
aren't
they
relevant?
you
said
a
minute
ago
--
a
few
minutes
ago
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
where
the
beginning
of
things
gave
authority
for
promulgating
regulations,
so
the
regulatory
system
becomes
relevant
throughout
our
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
macguineas,
i
should
think
it
would
help
the
court
if
you
told
it
the
history
of
this
discharge
without
honor
which
has
an
important
history,
well-known
in
the
history
of
this
country,
namely
the
discharge
of
a
whole
regiment
by
the
commander
in
chief,
president
theodore
roosevelt
in
the
case
--
in
the
brownsville
soldier's
case.
why
do
you
argue
this
case,
all
of
the
abstract,
as
though
that
is
a
sudden
new
thing
without
a
large
practical
history
behind
it
and
a
judicial
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
with
--
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
may
i
suggest
that
when
you
submit
that
in
print,
the
materials
that
are
relevant
for
the
understanding
of
this
case
in
determination
of
it,
you
indicate
what
materials
meaning
by
that
statute
regulation
directive
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
first
piece
of
paper,
the
undesirable
discharge
and
what
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
second
discharge.
so
we
keep
these
things
apart
and
know
what
was
before
the
authorizing
authority,
if
they
had
authority,
at
the
time
that
they
acted
as
they
did.
